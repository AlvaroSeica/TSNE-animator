[Intro: Myalansky]
Ayo, What time the flight leave for Cancun man
Shit man, Cause I gotta check this bitch out in L.A
Shit when she gone ring, Gotta catch that flight but it's like yo
Call the P.R. up, See what our itinerary doing man cause we busy
Mixtape pop'n off, We gotta lot of shit going on right now
We just gotta make sure

[Myalansky]
Catch me mash'n under county palm trees
In a booger green Mercedes on D's
Pulling through Hollywood, Style'n with Gs
Connects in Tijuana, Myalan smuggle'n ganja
Spanish Americans, We ??? ??? ???
Hundred P's each with two beans, Got it pop'n
Throw'n sixteen dollars a key, Look at the profit
Then chop it, Too hot for minks son we drink scotches
Movie star bitches seen often, Diana floss'n
In a mint Porsche, Mexican drug Lords we polly'n
An Arab and Yugoslavian who body men
Choke on Bacardi and gin, Link with foreigner
Barbarian, Gun carrying, Pushing heroin
Transport it back to Maryland, In caravans
We meet at a bar, Shift and then scram
Rubber bands so stick the the grands
While the mix get fixed in the bag
We eat at Roscoe's, Chicken and eggs
Snitch'n niggas politic for their bread, Motherfucker

[Hook: Myalanksy]
Got birds if you need em, Dons pack furs in a freezer
The kids rock jewelry from Sweden, Live like pharaohs in Egypt
Toast champagne with a diva, Shine like a King son
It was said he would soon come, Jesus

[Joe Mafia]
Posted out the beach in suites, Bring all the toys out
Iced up nice as fuck, You know we show'n out
Boat'n and two six machines steam'n, See em
Hopping out piped out shit, Seven-sixty B.M
Four pounds poke'n, Smoke'n, My niggas kushed up
Flex'n like the Clover Tar Mob with international status
In Cancun, An extravagant palace
Knock'n ashes off my Cuban watch'n thongs and asses
Throw'n bezzles in the speed boats to get them holla back girls
It's only that work on the chirp, And get it backward
We slid it off with five shots, First class ice in the glass
Ballons falling out the sky, Flag'n cats
Put the three hundred C up, Blow the shoes off em
When the Phantom, That make your bitch wanna hop in this
Syndicate, Skittled the chain, Price of a Range
Drug music is a certified crime rank for cheese</pre>
