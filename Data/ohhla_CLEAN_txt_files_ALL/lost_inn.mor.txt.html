V1: Pollution of carnal lucrative mind-state
designed with in eyes defiant to the divine
Rewind the white line sniffs good time through the seven squared four lines
Do you have any remorse for what you do behind the creaked door?
Mellow high careless
smelt by embarrassed kid
Smoke fuels travel up young nasal after passing through the bars of a cradle
Lungs try to expunge the mess
stuck coughing through a nights rest
Letting Jerry Springer baby-sit as you rob a Shell to pay the rest
A dent in Child's psyche
now a queer eye he might be
Make sure you're ready to start a family and could take care of yourself
Change the habits
abate the curse
Birth vitality to a kids health
Spelt C-O-N-S-I-S-T-E-N-T
Be consistent

(Chorus) This is not how it was
this is not how it should be
This is not how it was meant to be at all
We gotta wake up x4

V2: Whatever happened to the hopscotch innocence we as little kids possessed?
we lost it
Now possessing thoughts vexing into cold sweats unresting
I never say that I'm above earthlings
'cause I myself am a blessed curse of anomaly
Irony severs sorrow doubling as a thought
I reside inside the wintry chill of a secure hand as SOME LIKE IT HOT
Where has the laughter gone? With the lose of innocence
What do we trust in?
With the lost of innocence
We gotta get it back somehow

(Chorus)

It's like one step forward and two steps back
It always happeneds like that
Before the 9 to 5 drains you of your vision
Before fraudulent politics 
Before the comprehension of hypocrisy 
Before you thought to question what you learned
Before jealousy
Before shame
Before the feeling of worthlessness
Before being let down made us desensitized 
Before materialism
Before the lose of faith
Before we stopped dreaming... 
Don't stop dreaming</pre>
