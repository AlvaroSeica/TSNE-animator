Song:   All My Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You say you want my love
You can have it all
Seems like you're just my type, after all

I know you want a bad girl
Give him all of that
Take this all, won't give it back
I know you want all my love
I give you all of that
All of that, all of that, all of that

You came whole way like 18 willer
Take on eat gonna get your fill up
I can't help she's out, cause you're not with her
You look around but ain't nothing realer, no
I ain't here to stop it, so baby boy, don't stop it
I like it my way, and my hips are just right here

If you never had it boy
You don't know, you don't know, yeah
If you never had it boy
You don't know, you don't know, yeah

You say you want my love
You can have it all
Seems like you're just my type, after all

I know you want a bad girl
Give him all of that
Take this all, won't give it back
I know you want all my love
I give you all of that
All of that, all of that, all of that</pre>
