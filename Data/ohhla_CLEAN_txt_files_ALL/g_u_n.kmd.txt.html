[Intro]
{*BEEP!*} The fuck was that man?
That shit blew my head man...

[Zev Love X]
I got a brand new .380 in the box, made like glocks
A shoebox of bullets, two clips, no safety locks
Won't get knocked cause I avoid the rage
Catchin mad bodies like the AIDS
Used to carry blades, now I'm fully loaded, save the bullshit
Tempt me I'ma empty the whole shit, that's that cold shit
And that's what I'm into, and plus it's winter
And beef ain't squished until the bullet enter
Dead center or dead broke, when I got the flame out
I'm stickin up a drunk at the liquor store, he came out
cause my rent's due, fuck with my money I'ma dead you
And you can tell the {?} sent you, and he meant it
Cut your throat, and maim your last breath, wait
I got a bullet for your ass wit'cha name and your death date
Nigga!

[Interlude]
There it is - that's what got him
I don't know man...

[Chorus: Zev Love X]
I got my Get-U-Now (he's gonna Get-U-Now)
I got my Get-U-Now (he's gonna Get-U-Now)
I got my Get-U-Now (he's gonna Get-U-Now)
I got my Get-U-Now (he's gonna Get-U-Now)

[Intro]

[Zev Love X]
I had to get a shotty, the barrel's a double one
Cause my sidewalk got more shells than bubblegum
Stuck on it, I'm settin it, bring it if you want it
And I still got my .22, I'll never point it though
I go hip-hop, it pays by the sheets
So fuck my mother-in-law, I'm fin' to run the streets
Be the syntax error, delete
I live to spin wax, compete with off beat

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Zev Love X]
I got it, my tool, my utensil
to draw led in that ass like a pencil with a stencil
And let me see them kids who had beef in the summer
And they mugs, all look like Helen Keller but dumber
Ain't that a bummer?  I'll take you out your misery
I'll be the mad bluff caller like, caller ID motherfucker!
I'm rakin in the dough by the heap
(Get the cash) C-Cypher-Punks can't 'pete
(Buck his ass) The last that you heard of your Jeep
As you sleep, I buy it off my boys for dirt cheap

[Chorus] w/ variation "we gonna Get-U-Now"

[Outro]
Nigga!  Fucka, uhh, watch you drop!
You know what the fuck we talkin about, word is bond
And we ghost, C.M.!</pre>
