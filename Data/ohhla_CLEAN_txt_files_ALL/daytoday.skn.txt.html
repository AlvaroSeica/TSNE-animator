[Intro: "interviewer" (Skinnyman)]
"So Skinnyman, now that you've signed a deal with talkin loud and your currently 
recording your album, how's this altered your lifestyle...?"
(Let me play this one, tell you exactly how it is in ?
cause in my life, ain't nuttin nice...check ya blud...)

[Skinnyman]
Nowadays I live my life on a day to day basis
cuz everybody in the whole fam's got cases
romin the streets that are full of the screw faces
resortin us back to the blocks that are on the stair cases
we hope we don't get to face the bases
who wanna try and raise us to take the papers, laterz
to what my whole council estate is
dwellin on the city on top of these sky scrapers
me? I keep a watch over the whole of my acres
to those who wanna take us from 5'0's to fakers
cuz all were tryin'a be is money makers
so we might have had a chance to escape from some of these derelict places
were livin life at fast paces
It's like were gutter rats tryin'a contend these rap races
so best to tighten up your laces
cuz this year I'm steppin up a year to fast for you to chase us
You think id wanna stick around this town
and have to wait for a crackhead to beat my mum down
to get a phone call sayin just bring your money now
by any little ? with a bucket runnnin round
I don't love the sound of what those haters wanna do to me
thats why I'm not givin them any opportunity
for me its not about all of the money and the jewellrey
survival of the fittest-its life so now its you or me
and I don't wanna move away from the flats
but thats they only way for me to get away from these cats
I sit and wonder why the fuck it has to be like that
and wonder it would have been like if we blew up in rap
but thats a dream and me I put reality first
and yeah its real that these theives wanna steal your mums purse
does it seem, the whole of this manor is cursed
like the bubble is boilin and just waitin to burst
this generations gettin worse-these new man are comin up
nuttins out there for 'em so they just don't give a fuck
and they gettin to lose for them/they're out on streets late nights confused again
you put your feet in

their shoes for them
and you see what you can do for them
and you too might screw for them
and this ain't really nuttin new for them
a man like you will probably label them a hooligan
to live good or bad, but me I'm mud cause the hood is bad
dressin in rags on the ? you know my hood is mad
we worry bout gettin beat up or stabbed
now we worry bout the man thats come to shoot up the ?
the dreams we used to have are gone
for those hopes are basic needs were in the bottom of the barrel tryin'a fight for lifes necessities
those older man takin time to give advice to me
tryina show me just how nice my life could be
with me id like to share the vision
 but all I see is man on a mission
my streets are full of friction
and you can check my diction
it gets deep everywhere that you go
cuz theres snakes everywhere in every ghetto you go
wo wo...

[Outro: "interviewer"]
"So there we have it, a live interview from Skinnyman
outside subterania-the infamous home of hip hop-this is ?...signing out..."</pre>
