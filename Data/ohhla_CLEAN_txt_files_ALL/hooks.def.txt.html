Typed by: fywhla@yahoo.com

It's all y'all hooks
For real..
You wanna know what keep pissin' me off, pissin' me off
Yeah, my niggaz is too high off the calibur
Yeah, it's like this, check it -

[Defari]
I got that authentic Magic so you know I gotta rock it
Bailin' down the block with a pint in my pocket - of Hennessey
Both eyes open for the enemy
Take flight, ask questions last is the remedy
Listen, my status is a regular nigga
Except, I'm smarter than the average nigga
Listen, I've never been a following nigga
From the top to the bottom y'all some bother me niggaz
From - winter to autumn I'm a fatherly nigga
Get his bread for my daughter, I'ma fatherly figure
Go figure, y'all niggaz don't even drink hard liqour
On the real, y'all some Mike's Hard Lemonade niggaz

[Chorus]
You wanna know what keep pissin' me off, pissin' me off?
It's all y'all hooks..
You wanna know what keep pissin' me off, pissin' me off?
It's all y'all hooks..

[Defari]
I got that rookie Paul Pierce, so you know I gotta rock it
Bailin' down the block with a half in my pocket - of cush
Straight from Fre???'s bush
Any punk got problems then that punk get mushed
It's real, reelin' the feel like truck drivers, what the deal
Y'all niggaz ain't real, you duck divers
Now you feel - Defari got a smart ass mouth
But you ain't Frogger's, you ain't jumpin'
You ain't talkin' bout nothin'
I'm always rollin' Likwit, it's Tha Liks can you dig it?
You hate off top, then at the shows try to kick it
Don't mimick this flow around your bird for a gimmick
Cause all that'll happen she'll be fiending for my ????

[Chorus]

[Defari]
I got that killa Andre Miller, so you know I gotta rock it
Bailin' down the block, a few hundred in my sock
That's right, John got my line on tight
Goatee on tight, stay in spank whites
Clowns said they wasn't feelin' me
I've been sick of y'all hooks since last century
Rounds... of liqour for my niggaz
Pounds... of doja I told ya
I'm awesome, simply marvelous, spectacular
You gotta know how hard it is
With every word my fist touch your chin
Here, ease your wounds with gin
See a cowboy spit hard on top of ????
Make a man understand the way of righteous laws
See it used to be 26 lines back in the day
Now it's 256 rhymes in my two-way

[Chorus]</pre>
