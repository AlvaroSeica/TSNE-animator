Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus]
Push up in it, stir it up and hit it
I hope you long lasting, my punani so juicy
Can your wood stay hard all night
Can you beat it up, and make it act right
Put some pipe into my life
Tell your girl, you won't be home tonight

[Mussilini]
Come on ma, don't be asking me that
You know a playa act bad, when that back be fat
You got the sexual feeling, it's mad sex I'm instilling
I leave it swelling lil' baby, it's X and African in me
I got your pancreas bending, wait a minute I be through
Calling ma-naya-ma-ha, have you speaking Hebrew
Now what the D do, cause I'm worth a couple acres of land
I don't trick, I sneak in like the maintenance man
I push bricks push chicks, push whips
Leave that headboard bent, split clit push in
Game undetectable, no footprints
Good brain, look I'm head-able and got some good friends
Like a block you getting flipped, red broke and beat up
And like a stock you get shipped mailed, soaked and feet up
See that coke-a-kila, got you crunk as you need
We done done the damn thang, so I'ma leave holla at me later

[Chorus]

[Big Pokey]
See my wood stay hard all night, I put that pipe in they life
You know the kind, that make your wife act right
I be pushing up in they cushion, and hitting it right
Wall to wall, dog I'ma hit it tonight
Seem like every time we fight, we make up in bed
Rocking headboard knocking, bout to wake up the dead
Let the third leg talk, that hook got a coat
Sprung like a bad ankle, and can't walk
Jamming that Big H.A.W.K., and you already know
She ain't tripping on no nigga, cause she already sold
Make her hips spread, and her walk change up
Beat that thang up, you ain't gotta heat that thang up
She love it when I'm laying and bend it, got my man up in it
And two movies, with my hand up in it
Everytime I get it, I'ma stand up in it
Cause once the wood go flat, I'm finished

[Chorus]

[Lyrical 187]
You got me feeling like I'm losing my mind, it's hard to get a grip
Got me sweating running, ride and tearing up shit
Banging the headboard, fall to the flo'
Back to the wall, reach up and touch your toes
As I go deep up in ya, bump into your liver
Beat them walls down, have the neighbors think I'm killing ya
Flip it over squeeze your legs together, let me dick you from the back
Have you breathing, like a asthma attack
Get up on top, and let me spin ya around
Put that arch in your back, when I'm bringing it down
Call me big daddy papi, the pussy hole filler
Call me when you need it beat it up, I'll push it up in ya
I deliver like I'm precision, a hundred positions
Guaranteed to leave ya trembling, like Michigan winters
There it go with 1-8-7, freaky hoes best friend
Any hoe that I fuck, I can still fall in

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's the remix, it's the thug mix
It's the remix, it's the thug mix
It's the thug mix, it's the remix
It's the thug mix, it's the remix
And it's gonna go harder than first
And it's gotta be harder than the first
It's the remix, it's the thug mix
It's the remix, it's the thug mix
It's the thug mix, it's the remix
It's the thug mix, it's the remix
Stir it up and hit it</pre>
