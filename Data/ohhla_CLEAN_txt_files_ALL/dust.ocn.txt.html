[Frank Ocean]
Who's that talkin in the library?
Who's that talkin in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without my muse
Nothing special, every book in here I wrote
Some I'm not too proud; some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote, wish I could revise them
But there's no erasing, and the best advice I got was keep writing
And keep living, and keep lovin

[Chorus]
And when the ink dries, and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust

[Frank Ocean]
Who's that laughin in my library?
Who's that laughin in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place, be without your smile? Nothing special
I fell in love with you girl
You let yourself inside, with no respect for privacy
You said there's too much on my mind
Then you ripped out a page, and set that shit on flame I quit writing
Noooo, I kept living, whoahhhh, I kept lovin

[Chorus]</pre>
