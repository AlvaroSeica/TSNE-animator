Song:   Count Your Blessingz
Typed by: Lil Hustle

Yeah, yeah, yeah lifetime
A lifetime, yeah, yeah
Whoa, I got a story look...

[Max Minelli]
It goes, too many enemies, not enough friends
Too many people struggling killing me, not enough ends
Where do we go from here, my stormy night done disconnected my life
It felt like they disconnected me from my life
I'm making plans but they crumble, these days it's hard to stay humble
When dope done turned my neighborhood to a jungle
And many niggas stumble, fucking the thin line
I ain't no killa but look I will to defend mine, then shine
In time I'ma get it right, I'm respecting my life
I'm grabbing, holding, kissing, hugging it tight
Hoping I'll make it through the rest of the year
Cause I don't what was worser the World Trade, or the death of a leader
It's like the message is clear, I'm still here, God must got a plan
So I keep holding back the rest of my tears
I don't know if he testing my fate, or testing my fears
I just respect it as the blessing it is, cause a blessing it is aiight

[Chorus: Russell Lee &amp; Rasheed]
Ooooh-oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I done lost a lot of friends in my lifetime
Ooooh-oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I done shed a lot of tears in my lifetime
Ooooh-oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I done felt a lot of pain in my lifetime
Ooooh-oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
But I'ma make it through the rain in my lifetime 

[Baby Beesh]
Now I'm just saying though making my music, it's for my money
I'm just saying though, pulling the zags within the dummy
I'm just saying though, some thangs that'll make you laugh'll make you cry
That's how it goes partna, why ask why
I'm off promethozyne, sticky green, off the herb soldemzyne
In between all around, they can't stop the underground
Baby Beesh off the leash, the Lone Star governer
With Happy P rocking Northern and the Southerner

[Low-G]
And if I follow the sun, it took me right back to the huntho
What I love the most, my streets, my life and my music 
And I started thinking, about the words he once told
Is he coming, is he goes only God knows
So fuck that, I ain't gone quit till my last stage
So if I live by it, I'ma die by it
I got to survive living each stage in my hard life
Yeah, you know

[Chorus]

[Grimm]
So many years out of town, could of been with the fam
But if I done stopped back then, I wouldn't be where I am
All the vans, flashing cans, grabbing hands at them shows to do
Can't get too close to you, what am I suppose to do
Those of you, that all been thinking of the good life
Should try, to be attracted with the hood life
Good bye, two of the things you take for granted
Like a night with all your family without a psycho fanatic

[SPM]
I'm so use to the streets, I feel at home in the hood
I just couldn't leave, I'm forever Hillwood
Fuck luxurious, but everyday a stupid bitch
See me and say, I don't give a fuck who he is
I'm so new to this, living like Julious
I'm known for cruising whips, and doing boys the ugliest
In this game there's only two things I need
My nuts and my gun, hold up that's three

[Chorus]
