[Brett B]
Sometimes, when you a child
You don't understand
The sacrifices made
For your well being
But as you become an adult
You start to understand
A little more
Of what was given
Forgive me, mother

(Verse 1)
[Coyote]    Life given
            Seeds, embryos in the womb
            Repetitious like (???), death call in Judes
            From clay
            To blood, one's flesh sink soon
            Blociando, street time, death makin' room
            It's a cycle
            Repeating like the phases of a moon
            Take it down six feet
            Sign names for the bloom
            Mad awake, your jefita
            A casket in the room
            Think not of my tune
            Mama, I see my doom
            Mortal wound
            In tuned, here I am, follow who
            If we were to part
            Cuando te vuelvo a ver
            What I know, you're mi mama, te quiero reconocer
            De volver a fallacer
            (???)
[Fifth Sun] Y volver, volver
            Volver
[Brett B]   Back to your arms once again
            Beggin' for forgiveness, for all my sins
            Mother would thaw the love I have in my heart
            Always were my angel, right from the start
            Fifth Sun
[Fifth Sun] I don't want to lose your love
            My gift from above

Chorus: Malverde (Fifth Sun) {Singer in background}
Lloras, mi lagrimas de sangre {Perdona me, madre}
Lloras, mi lagrimas de sangre (Si no estoy mal, te perdoma me, madre) {Perdona me}
Lloras, mi lagrimas de sangre {Perdona me, madre}
Lloras, mi lagrimas de sangre (Si no estoy mal, te perdoma me, madre) {Perdona me}

(Verse 2)
[Malverde]  Madresita
            Ton asi
            The one that got in me, when I was struggling
            Segi mi joben, escucha, me andas perdido
            No dura mucho, los que van por tu camino
            Si no cambias, vas a ver como te va
            Dios te bendiga, lo que sera, sera
            Llorar, de mucha lagrimas por mi
            Nightly, thinkin' what might be of me
            But I didn't see what you predicted
            You kicked in my life, that was wicked, there's some inflicted
            Explicit, extreme that I gotta redeem
            Perdona me madre, I'm a apologize sin
[Brett B]   Always and forever
            For now until whenever
            You leave me, never
            I never sever
            Or spring off your womb
            You made my flowers bloom
            In this world full of doom
            So
            Mother, please understand
            I give you all my love, yo, for making me a man
[Fifth Sun] I don't want to lose your love
            My gift from above

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Chingon]   I lose my life
            To save yours, forever more
            I go crazy
            When I see, your tears full
            Out
            Now my mom's worried sick, lookin'
            Hospitals, morgues, I'm at Central Booking
            The gift of God
            Mothers have great power
            Somethin' bad happens, to dead on
            They never coward
            Two-eleven
            And that (???) one-eight-seven
            Convicted felon
            I'm just sittin' here, dwellin'
            Llora sangres, las puertas nunca abren
            Querida madre, perdona me si no esta
            Because I rather die
            Than to see my mother cry
            But now I know, why shy cry, cause she knows I'm gonna die
[Fifth Sun] Fly, fly, fly away
            Pray
            That I live to see another day
[Brett B]   Cause you know I'm caught up
            Runnin' around in wicked ways
            My mother's livin' with candles, and every night, she prays
[Coyote]    Pathways
            Fades after phase, dawg raised
            In that haze to the days, feeling blazed in the crazed
[Fifth Sun] I don't want to lose your love
            My gift from above

Repeat Chorus Til Fade</pre>
