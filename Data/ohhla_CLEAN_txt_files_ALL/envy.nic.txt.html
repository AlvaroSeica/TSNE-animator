[Intro]
"Nigga holla at your boy"
See I think y'all see the similarities now
Me and Nicki we both like money
We both run the streets, and our HATERS
Aw man~! Y'all make us do what we do!!
("Aphilliates nigga, pay attention")

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj singing]
Envy, all they do is envy, don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm comin back, swingin fo' that
Envy, why would they offend me? Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm comin back, swingin fo' that ass
Swah-swingin fo', sah-sah-sah-swingin fo' {*4X*}
(Mercy, mercy, mercy; why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?)
(Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty; why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me?)

{HOLIDAY SEASON!!}

[Nicki Minaj]
Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
Cause I pack shows, sell ticks like Boston
Pat your back ho, why the fuck they coughin?
Oh I got 'em sick, better get that coffin
I say coffin, you can say casket
They're so trash, but where's the waste basket?
Where's my hat and where's my straight jacket?
Yep they jackin, back to Maybachin
Everything I do bitches wanna do it too
I guess-guess you'll just skip to my lou
I just came through I flew to St. Lou
Back to kill you, they blew like HQ
Why is it that they make Nicki a target?
Just cause this lil' piggy went to the market
Marketing steps, they marketed sex
Ma-mark it with a X, they talkin them checks now, now, now

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo - why did envy? Why you go against me?
When I got trendy, why you ain't commend me?
Why when I needed it, why you couldn't lend me?
Why you was secretive, frontin like you friendly?
Why did you fear that? Held my career back
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that
Cause now I see-see-see-see all your run-down
Niggaz better have my money by sun down
Cause now when I come through I'm stylin on 'em
It's like I got hotter than islands on 'em
They say she got colder than igloos - did she?
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi
Just left Mr. Miyagi
Tell that bitch jump if that bitch feel froggy
Cause I got one leg up in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck when that bell go DING~!

[Chorus]

("Yo, it's The Aphilliates nigga, pay attention")

[repeat 2X]
I'm me, don't you like what you see?
Won't you get like me?
Cause you thought that I would die
But I'm fine

[Outro]
{*"Fine" echoes*}
I'm on the go, I'm on the go but
But dem a try to stop my flow yup
Yup yup yup, I'm fine, I'm fine

[Chorus] up to "swingin fo' that ass"

("The Aphilliates, nigga!")</pre>
