Chorus 2x

You climb on a deal wet boys for real
Each and every city club they should feel
All playa hatas gotta bow and kneel
If you try to trip you'll get flipped with steel
You climb on a deal wet boys for real
Each and every city club they should feel
Made the right moves now we movin tough
Gotta holla at the city whats up

Hooked up with T-Bone and we puttin down
Newcomer with the tracks the tracks from uptown
Wet boy players going nationwide
Niggaz with the beef better run and hide
Sporty Records doing it making mega bucks
Cromed out bikes with the fire trucks
Had to lay it out with the sparkle plus
Supported by T thank you very much
Ain't notihng to it te way we do it
Set the date collabarate and just run through it
I been doing this shit since 84
99 coming up and I still got more
Oh check the flow doing good in the dough
Started off bad in class now I'm checking out the flow
My boy Lil Lee hooked me up with the game
(?) and I started my fame
First school in the city that was making tapes
Sporty as can be and I'm living great
Pops wasn't around when he put me in
Grab the first (?) and then

Chorus 2x

I got style that you wouldn't beleive
I flip a crew with the greatesr D
Man I'm doing this shit I can't lie
Told the whole shit bye bye
Making money with my crew making cash flow
Getting props in the streets with a doper throw
Not a hot boy but I burn like hell
Hit the charts do it smart mow I got to sell
Record bussiness move quick I got your hoe sick
Making so much on a slick
Now peep the come up cause I stand alone
Sellin tapes thats great for a car and a home
Ya'll can't see me with a telescope
Can't catch the record sales but you can smell the smoke
Got the bussiness all packed sporty records is back
Running gsme like a mack here me flippin the track
Wet boys for real headbusters we kill
Moving dope and trees all down in the deal
Look at me now I clock my own shit
Wrong nigga you should wanna fuck with

Chorus 2x

Ain't shit changed but the weather partner
Nothing but best want nothing less
Cromed out guns with the gold triggaz
(????) flip the best
Bot it down packed making big noise
Paper stacked with the wet boys
All the cameros bout to watch them go
Right before a (?) on the show room floor
Keepming up with my tapes gotta watch for fedz
If they catch a baller slppin they gon have that bag
Can't get popped cause I had to stop
Forget the dope game now I moved to hip hop
Got the rap down packed and you know my name
Independent like P bout to do it the same
Got players on my team making nothing but cream
Running over player haters who be trying to scheme
T-Bone on the map with the coldest tracks
Wet boys come up with the coldest raps
From the old style like I freestyle flow
Who want some of bit T-Bone?
