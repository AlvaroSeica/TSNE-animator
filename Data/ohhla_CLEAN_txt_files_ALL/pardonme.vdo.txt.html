Song:   Pardon Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Pardon, my nigga, but I control this
Asking my nigga what hand he roll with
Paper normally brown, today is white, though
Niggas normally clowns without the bright nose
Pardon, my nigga, my money been long
Red carpet, my nigga, 100 men strong
You know I could do Armani, Versace wear
Call a jeweler, Aviani or Raphael
100 for y'all, pull out the weed around
Ciroc toast in style, we La Marina bound
Everyone is a godfather, we keep a pact
What's the numbers, they ball park it then bring it down
Pardon my nigga, me and my queen high
Both dragging chinchillas, sit in that ring side
Bless you, bowtie, mine is the bean pie
Got peas for 35, yeah, them things fly

Pardon, my nigga, you need to roll up
Pardon, my nigga, what's with the hold up?
Pardon, my nigga, but that's the job there
Sorry, my nigga, but it ain't no drugs here

See you about things, getting lifted like gold wings
This summer I'm a rock my fall sneaks
Twice as high, Twin Peaks
By design, this is all me
Floor seats, still covering out mouths when we speak
Try to catch us but that Ferrari won't let you
Try to tell you, I don't brag but I'm better
It's like I don't bring my A game till you bet 'em
Then I show range, rain on my competitors
Then I'm back in the range with the basketball leathers
You the state troopers, I like wrestling projectors
Homie, this a movement, maneuvering for cheddar
Mess on mundane, throw the rest in the bank
Home boy, if you know better you smoke better
My motherfucking dro grows better

Pardon, my nigga, you need to roll up
Pardon, my nigga, what's with the hold up?
Pardon, my nigga, but that's the job there
Sorry, my nigga, but it ain't no drugs here

How do y'all fly, got the munchies for more
Every day is a gamble but it's just the allure
Staying real is organic, copping low is a sport
No pun intended but my point got across
Composing the ether, occasionally spike my leaders
It's pink, this purple finessing reflect on my circle
Bill with my niggas, shit, we learn from each other's lessons
Gotta share gems to receive more blessings
Royalty niggas, we are kings
Kush gods serving [?] all steam
Make sure my core team get more cream
Then bail out and leaving I'm creating more steam
Light up without a possible care
I put the pot in the air and watch the pot disappear
Magic, I'm a foam head, polo, junkie addict
Logo, two L's, you know my status

Pardon, my nigga, you need to roll up
Pardon, my nigga, what's with the hold up?
Pardon, my nigga, but that's the job there
Sorry, my nigga, but it ain't no drogs here</pre>
