[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
Pull up, on the double, these boys want trouble
They call me Flintstone, and my homie's born/Barn' Rubble
Rebel
Devil
Chase em' through the ghetto
Breakin' these boys off with just one dedo
Metal bracelets, facin', once incarceration
Aim for the dome, tryin' to keep my concentration
Since elementary
It was destined for me
To blow it up eventually
Late Friday, or was it early Saturday
I hit him with the shotty that I bought from academy
Duck for cover
Eat 'em up for supper
Didn't momma say not to play with people from the gutter
I smell undercovers
I die with my brothers
And when I'm on the mic, I represent all colors
Late night chroma, streets are an asylum
You know the three digits, holmes, you better dial 'em

Break 1: South Park Mexican
No matter where you at, do you represent your city
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you take fools out like the homie Frank Nitty
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Did your crib get raided by this little piggy
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Have you ever whooped a billy til he really look silly
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
I suck the blood like mosquito
Facin' Judge Ito
Blunt in my mouth, lookin' big as a burrito
Turnin' ten into twenty
Twenty into forty
Forty into eighty
Everything is gravy
Won't you play me in your deck-ah
Microphone check-ah
Quick to grab a chickenhead, hutch by the neck-ah
Double decker
Pigeons on my Woody Woodpecker
Suckers call me Grind, say that I'm a homewrecker
Berreta
Underneath my
Raider sweater
Freak the fine loca by the name of Jueta
Stackin' more cheddar, the Speedy Gonzales
Smoother than the head of Mister Telly Sevalas
Tu sabes
Haciendo jales
Movin' yabes
Order two tacos with the beans and nopales
Don't blame us
Cause Baby Bash is famous
And got my fingers
All up in your baby mama [{*anus*}]

Break 2: South Park Mexican
Do you raise Ben Davis, or do you sag Dickies
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Does your girl got your name tattooed on her [{*titty*}]
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you bump 2Pac, or do you bump Biggie
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you sleep with your wife or with a nine milli
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
I got sacks for sale, in the land of hell
My enemies don't even get a chance to yell
In the black Seville
With my man Miguel
Little pigs wanna put a player back in jail
Stack my mail, where the bastards dwell
Puffin' on Jane cause that's my gal
Never brag or tell, but I blast 'em well
I shoot more shots than Sam Cassell/can sell
Well
Pick the chosen, and form an alliance
Move in silence and gather loyal clients
Corporate giants
With street science
Cookin' dope on a kitchen appliance
They try it
Buy it
And put it in they diet
Kicked me out the Hyatt cause my room was a riot
Lyin' in a white, diamonds on my belt buckle
SPM like Tarzan
Lord of the jungle

Break 3: South Park Mexican
Do you got five screens in your '86 Rivi?
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you flip Snow White quick, fast, in a jiffy
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
When you buy new tennies, do you spend one fifty
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you buy swisha sweets, or do you buy Phillies?
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Have you ever bought a TV from dope fiend, Willie
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you sip Cognac, or do you sip Remy
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Have you ever slapped a chick for givin' you a big hickey
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy {*laughing*}
Do you get thangs crunk, or do you get jiggy
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Will you still be stickin' when you're way past sixty {*chuckling*}
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Could I hide in your house if the cops was tryin' to get me
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Would you hit a thick chick, even though she wasn't pretty
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
If I was doin' bad, would you smoke a blunt with me
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy</pre>
