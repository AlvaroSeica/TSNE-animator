mic check one two
you know when you lose somebody 
somebody that's close to you
somebody that's probably not even that close to you
you might have just knew him
it's hard to put it into words you know
it's hard to say what you feel
it's hard to say what you feel....
I guess all wounds heal over time
you know...but uh
all i can do now is reminisce

(Verse One)
Look at my homeboy lying there dead in the street
His eyes wide open and it's fucking with me
I can't believe this shit it really seems unreal
My streetwise ass dog ended up getting killed
We used to laugh but now this shit ain't funny at all
Thinking about when my dog first started to ball
Telling me I was blessed use my gift
But it was hard to stay away from that gangsta shit (so hard)
Young eyes attract glitter like glue
Running with a crew doing everything they do
Smoked out drinking mad dog and thunderbird
My momma screaming but I swear I never heard a word
My homeboy's momma cool but she smoke crack
Now getting high is how she bring her son back
Imagine that so many kids are living this
One day my son will lose someone and reminisce
I hope it's me when I'm a hundred and three
Your homeboy getting killed that's some bad shit to see
I hope you agree and make it better for the young ones
Cause these momma's can't take no more dead sons

Chorus

Can't you see the way we live 
The world wouldn't spin without gangsta shit
I don't know what you've been told 
But baby somebody told me
(Only the strong will survive)
If I die press play to bring me back to life
(Only the strong will survive)
Hey yo if I die press play to bring me back to life

(Verse Two)
Riding around in a hoop smoked out behind tent
Serving all day hitting corners getting bent
Time went by quick when we was kicking it
I wish that there was a way I could have predicted this
Somehow thought the shit but I can't blame myself
I just wish that death would have took somebody else
That niggas' shorty looks just like he did
So in a sense I guess my homeboy will live again
In the eyes of his seed forever dad
No one to call on when momma is doing bad
Mad at the world for the pain he feels
I pray to god that his momma shows him what's real

Chorus

(Verse Three)
Every day I thank god for watching over me
If I didn't have rapping I don't know where I would be
Trying to move a key strong armed robbery
My destiny could have been an early death of me
Just to be alive pushing twenty-five
I lived to talk about the shit many didn't survive
All I ask is that we think about the lives passed away
Never to see another sunny day
&gt;From rocks in the hand to keys in the van
No more being broke waiting on the postman
Cost more than the time that you put into it
Now you got the cheese why the fuck you still do it
Greed a need to speed away your precious time
Playa use your mind find yourself another grind
If not for yourself... for the kids sake 
Cause they'll all be where were all at today

Chorus

Man oh man
It's wild what these streets are doing to us 
You know what I'm saying?
I was thinking I was telling my homie
If I were to name all the people that I knew
That was not here with us no more
It would take a whole album 
You know what I'm saying?
So i wanna say rest in peace to my homeboy pinkhouse
Rest in peace to my homeboy dice 
Who showed me much love in the short time i knew him
Rest in peace to my homeboy Nino
Much love from the hood we still ride with ya</pre>
