[Verse 1]
I walk the Earth with a fire(?) made in space-time fabric
I spit monuments to let you know I was alive like an Aztec
I stay in tune where everything is everything
So if you look you can find me anywhere like plastic
There's one word to answer every raised hand
One drop to make a ocean from a desert wasteland
A God in all life, for all races and shapes
So WAKE UP, that awful fate you had in place is erased
Here's a real beginning...
My brother's carrying so much fear, guilt, and regret 
That the universe's wheels are spinning
Open your spirits herein, hear the wisdom 
Y'all dig my vision in my rhythm
Cause the light of God is clearly with him
If I was gangsta, they'd play me all the time
But killer please allow me to gracefully decline
My sights set so far above you rappers and you crooks now
I can't see the expression on your faces when I look down

Song structure tells you I should sing a hook now
But sixteen bars can't compensate for what you took out
The revolution ain't about a salary
The idea is that dead white men are still controlling our reality
There's no time to grab the mic and give you half of me
So I rap like Suge Knight's hanging *ME* off of a balcony
We just around the corner, close your eyes, and count to three
There's no words for me to describe the beauty you 'bout to see

[Chorus]
When the sun rise...
And everything around becomes clear
When the sun rise...
We'll see that we had nothing to fear
When your spirit stops doubting for the very first time
And your faith won't scale a mountain, you just might have to climb
When the sun rise...
We'll see that it was us all along
Everyone dies...
But living in this hell made us strong
When will my people find they way out of that basement of lies
And stop looking for salvation in the vacant blue skies

[Verse 2]
I used to feel like Jesus had forsaken my soul, but yo, fuck him
We never had a proper introduction
??? Beruca tie alle noy alle hem ???
Y'all been condemning me to Hell since they cut my foreskin
My spirit let me make peace with the scripture
But y'all pointin' burning arrows at a piece of a picture
They turned Christ's mass to a circus(?), we ain't care
Avoiding them cancer patients, pray for Jesus, he ain't there
I watch y'all flash stars and crosses like gang signs
I rock a platinum stick figure called mankind
My God exists in all walks and all places
She don't condemn gays, and she don't defend racists
She told me here's a breath of life, don't waste this
You don't gotta holler for no preachers or no masons
You don't gotta trap me in no people or no pages
Cause we encompass everything that live throughout the ages
Just like a drop of water comes from the sea
And goes back, everything that equals God is in me
It's in black people, white people, young people, old people
It's all good, it's just a way of saying, "No Evil"
The physics of the matter's concrete
No opposing force could compromise the cipher complete
Mother your blessings have been showered on me
Cause all I need's a heartbeat to have the power to *BE*

[Chorus]
When the sun rise...
And everything around becomes clear
When the sun rise...
We'll see that we had nothing to fear
When your spirit stops doubting for the very first time
And your faith won't scale a mountain, you just might have to climb
When the sun rise...
We'll see that it was us all along
Everyone dies...
But living in this hell made us strong
When will my people find they way out of that basement of lies
And stop looking for salvation in the vacant blue skies</pre>
