When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then

When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then

[Verse 1]
You Know Retarted, When I Fall In
Not a Alcoholic, drinkin kuz I'm bouht it
20 deep still betta let my dogs in
Oh we gon clown bitxh yhu betta kall tha laws then
Polo sweater, polo horses on my buttons
You gon let me show it off, ian spot this stack fa nothin
You ain't neva seen a goon bring his goons on tour?
Hit mans, I put my goons on yours
Exotic, smokin like chokin on friday
That loud, that loud, smell it when ya walk by me
Pill man, I think I'm a need some pills
So wen I hit tha the stage they kan turn me up a lil
Muthafuckin swagga jackers, I'm jackin mi own swagg
I'm a put it own now, don't throw it in the bag
Youngin music, you know we baby powdered up
And when we hit the mall all the hoes follow us

[Chorus]
Don't Ask Kuz You Alreadyyy Knoooow
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
Don't Ask Kuz You Alreadyyy Knoooow
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then

[Lil Trill]
See when I do it, I do it I'm a do it all the way
Sittin lookin at tha crib like "what I'm a drive today? "
See I mite just take the Bentley, the phantom, or the lam
Take my chick up in Finley and show shorty how I am
I do what I really do, I show up to show off
We came like 30 deep and we'll tear tha door off
Lil trill and the trill fam, man you know how we roll
The last to hit tha stage but tha 1st to rock the show
You know, you know gone, what we holla in BR
Wats hatnin witcha shawty what we holla in the GA
I was born with tha swagg, you get yours offa ebay
I do what I do it, I really do it tha dumb way
I'm exclusive all tha time, you kan be like me one day
I be stuntin like baby, from monday to sunday
Expensive chain with tha rinq, got me doin my thang
Comin throo tha hood errbodi know my name {I'm Like}

[Chorus]
Don't Ask Kuz You Alreadyyy Knoooow
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
Don't Ask Kuz You Alreadyyy Knoooow
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then
When I do it I'm a do it, like do it then</pre>
