Song:   Something Grown Together
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Something grown together
An agreement
Whether or no the weather is hot or freezing
Until the day of bereavement

Something known forever
A convergence
Of lifelines and lifetimes full of wonderings and longings and searchings

Commitment and devotion
An adventure
A kiss to span the oceans when in sickness when healthy tired or injured

Energy and passion
An investment
Entering onto a path intertwined laughing crying and learning lifelong lessons

Something grown together
Something grown together
Something grown together
Like branches of a banyan tree
Deeply rooted in family
Giving life to a canopy
Much more than a crush more than a brush with where happenstance is standing
Compatible hearts like raggedy anne and andy
Bump bump
Bump bump
But the beat changes up when he sees her
Takkity takkity taka taka taka taka
Takity takity-
Can't believe the rhythm is so in sync
And that isn't there only strength
They were humming a tune
The sun and the moon
They didn't know what to think
But they were pleased to see these two young souls become mates
To provide light for a song that was sung right in one take
Because there's no need to rehearse when you and your partner get in the zone
And you can't memorize words you've always known

[Chorus]</pre>
