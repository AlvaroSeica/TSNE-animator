[Chorus: Apocalipps (Truck)]
I, will, pop, you, right now (Not now, right now)
I, will, drop, you, right now (Not now, right now)

[Apocalipps]
That nigga bleed just like us, catch him at a spot, trynna cop
What the fuck, he smoke weed just like us
Yo, if you really wanna wrap him homey
I can sweep they whole team without Shaq or Kobe
Them dudes you hang wit is pussy, saying let that ride
Nah, youse a fool if you let that slide
Retaliation in the first degree, we family, B
That shit he did to you, it's like he did it to me
Alright now, go put the things in the Civic
And we gon' start with the dudes who roll with 'em, to the cat that did it
This is the get back, click blaow, nigga, get back
Hit him in his chest, it'll be a while, before he catch his wind back

[Bless]
Yo, the voice of the streets is back, where, right here
And any nigga want it with Bless, the booth is right there
I make the lights shut down in this bitch
And ya'll gon' think Rakim wrote this 16, quick
I mastered this, and ya'll looking like the New York Knicks
Now pack ya shit, before ya meat guard in this bitch
And fuck ya chain, I'm starving, I'mma snatch ya kicks
Right in the booth, the streets already know I'm the truth
Outside the booth, the fifth'll blow ya North Face loose
And it's only winter, but you asked for a hot a day
To get your head popped off tonight and blowed the right way
And you can run this shit back to ya click like fall back
There's 2 from the pump'll make you take off like dogs sent

[Chorus]

[Truck]
On the real, do you really want drama wit me?
Why you all in my face, you got a problem wit me?
Go get ya gun, muthafucka, you can solve it wit me
The bigger the bang, man, go practice ya aim
For you slip the fuck up and get popped in ya brain
Yo, I hate to sound raw, but ain't no pounds no more
Ya'll niggas can't even come, through my town no more
And the only thing I got now, is rounds for ya'll
At your funeral, I'mma be looking down on ya'll
What you think, shit is funny, don't make me blast you, dummy
Fuck what you heard, Truck'll give ya ass a run for the money
Go head, place ya bet, nigga, raise ya set
I'm not a son, raising child, I'm raising the tech

[Beno]
If you'se a killa, the repping shouldn't be ya job
You should be working for the muthafucking mob
Mr. Hitman, don't get hit, man, for talking, shit, man
Know what I grip, fam, the big arms
Whatchamacallit, don't make Beno wild out
In this bitch like an alcholic
Cuz you know what I'm addicted to, got you, some stick in you
Catch you with ya boo and guess what, she a victim to
You know what this nigga do, smake the bitch, a nigga to
Stab you, pull a trick or two, I'm so unpredictable

[Chorus]

[Iron Mic]
It's Iron Mic, bitch, I ain't never heard of you
And I ain't no killa, nigga, but I murder you
The dream team, it don't matter who I throw it to
We gon' score, man, we banging them fours
We make, money and spend it, go and spend with for more
So I scream fuck the police, the hell wit the law
You ain't never heard no shit like this before
They want peace in the rap game, we bringing the raw
We ain't asking no more, man, we kicking ya door
Cock back, let off a biggie, I got Brooklyn wit me
Staten, Queens, BX, uptop, the whole New York City
Ruthless, this time we get it back, get ya knife, get to stab
Start wilding black, bringing Staten Island back

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
