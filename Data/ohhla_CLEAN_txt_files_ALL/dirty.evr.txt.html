[Everlast]
And I'm so dirty, call me daddy
You're so sexy, you can be my bad girl
If someone hurt you, and you tried to hide it
I'd cut you deeper, cause I know you like it
The pain I got girl, can satisfy you
But I can't love you, I won't even try to
And that junkie urge, deep down inside you
Couldn't keep my secret, but I know you'd like to

[Chorus]
Girl you're never gon' get blood from a heart of stone
Some of us were just plain, meant to be alone
I'm all out of secrets, I'm runnin out of lies
And I can see the end girl, when I look into yo' eyes

[Everlast]
And I'm so nasty, and I'm so greedy
And I'm so lonesome, girl I'm so needy
I wanna take you, and make you my girl
My willing hostage, my favorite prisoner
I'll be your owner, and I'll be your jailer
I'll be your lover, girl I'll be your savior
I'll be your Alpha, and your Omega
I'll break your heart girl, and you'll call me later

[Chorus]

[Outro: repeat 4X to fade]
And I'm so dirty, call me daddy
You're so sexy, you can be my bad girl</pre>
