In the beginning was the word, and the word was made flesh ...

He's the holy one, here comes the holy one
The one and only son of the Lord
God, behold, hold!
Clear my path, demons, step aside! 

I know who thou art, thou art the last true soldier

Hath thou come to sever us before our time? 

Thou know what time it is! 

Then why hast thou come?
And what would thou have wish to do?

Into the swine! You bring it to me, and I'll take it to him
And he'll take it to my father! 
And out of this mouth proceeded a tongue
That spat like a double-edged sword! 

He's the holy one, here comes the holy one
The one and only son of the Lord
God, behold, hold!

Ever since the resurrection, we needed a quicker test
But nonetheless, I check 'em with blessings
I learned my lesson
Nigga, just take protection, fully got correction
I point a direction the Smith &amp; Wesson, was it my fault? 
Nah, Jesus, he got hung up on the crucifix
And just cause what he preach
And people thought he was a lunatic! 
It seems like they've been tricked by the mystic spirit
Better open up your eyes or
Be planning to get tossed in a ditch, bitch

He's the holy one, here comes the holy one
The one and only son of the Lord
God, behold, hold!</pre>
