Three, four..

[Phonte]
All alone again
In the evening time, the feeling time
No longer can pretend
Need some healing time, to ease my mind
Sometimes it all seems so enormous
Without a way to make it through
Feels like the world is coming for us
And this is all that I can do

[Chorus]
Oh, a storm is coming down outside
And I'm lost inside this pain
Gonna lay my troubles to the side
And just listen to the rain

[Phonte]
All alone again
In the morning time, the dawning time
I wonder how you've been
And the time away, if it's all you say
Sometimes it all seems so enormous
I wonder why we even try
(Why do we, why do we even try?)
Feels like the world is coming for us
But this is my way to get by, by!

[Chorus]</pre>
