[Jagged Edge] Chorus:

           My life
           Why you can't just let me live? (bounce that ass shorty)
           My life, I'll lie for my niggas, I'll die for my niggas
           Yeah my life, everybody wanna be a big shot
           My life, why you can't just let me live?
           My life, my, my, my, my

[Cap.One]
Cap to the one, young nigga, rap be the bomb
Back to the guns, niggas through ice at their mouths
Fuckin' with thugs, have y'all niggas lowded with slugs
In the creep, body stankin nigga covered with bugs
See I'm a true to life nigga, the screw your wife nigga
A baller, indorsement, ecko and nikes nigga
Shit, you right nigga, I'm cocky as hell
So fuck you, I still be a million copies in sell
Infact im 4 plat, still on the block with my hat broke back
Like a nigga sold crack
Step the game up, I had to take the gold back
and I ain't hatin' nigga but your game is so wack
I smack motherfuckers
Jack motherfuckers
Cock back ? and blast motherfuckers

(Chorus)

[Cap.One]
See I hate  fake niggas, slash cake niggas
Thugs for there girl but they really hate niggas
Raw type I hit it with a 38 niggas
From the chest, to the nose, to you face nigga
I used to have big niggas, doe made us split up
Now I'm Cap dolo, rap solo, mac photos, big guns, and I act loco
What the fuck you wanna do, you act broke hoe, for the doe
Life's a bitch, reason why I don't trust these chicks
Big body six, sittin on flicks, chain down to my dick
Rock iceberg, like it aint shit, and close shop
Everytime I spit, these niggas is bitch
Talking loud like you niggas is shootin again
You motherfuckers steady making me rich, can I live, yeah

    (Chorus)

[Cap.One]
I  44 clap niggas, spit rap niggas
Bitch slap niggas slash kidnapp niggas
Stort motherfuckers for their jewels and their chain, 
shoes and their caine
That's the rules to this game
Cap-One nigga, I lock your spots
and while y'all niggas dodge your shots
I'm coppin yatchs, toppin' charts (number one)
Just let the  doe stacked where the tro at
Play my game fat, you will never get your hoe back
C-One king of the city
When I die burry me jiggy between makaveli and biggie
All my life, I've been lustin' for doe 
and pray to god for the day that I blow
It's all that a hustla knows
Let's get this money baby

[Cap.One]
For my baller ass niggas
[Jagged Edge]
My, my, my, my, my, my...life
[Cap.One]
Let me live

(Chorus) 2X
