Typed by: timmy.bogenburt@gmail.com

Baby, when I think about you
I think about love
And darling, I won't live without you
And your love
If I had these golden dreams
Of my yesterday
I would wrap you in the Heavens
Till I'm dying, on the way

I feel like makin' love
I feel like makin' love, love, love
I feel like makin' love
I feel like makin' love, love, love
I feel like makin' love to you

Baby, if I think about you
I think about love
And darling, if I live without you
I live without love
If I had the sun and the moon
And they were shinin'
I would give you both night and day
Of satisfyin'

I feel like makin' love
I feel like makin' love, love, love
I feel like makin' love
I feel like makin' love, love, love
I feel like makin' love to you

And if I had those golden dreams
Of my yesterday
I would wrap you in the Heavens
Till I'm dying on the way

Feel like makin' love, oh, uh, uh
Baby I feel like makin' love, oh, uh, yeah

I feel like makin' love, love, love
I feel like makin' love, love, love
I feel like makin' love, love, love
I feel like makin' love, love, love
I feel like makin' love to you, to you, to you</pre>
