[Werd]
Yeah Werd S.O.S. and I dont do this for me
I do this for you its all yours ken its for you

I said to myself I dont like this
I said to myself I aint like this
But oh hell man lets recite this
Because your the one thing in my life thats priceless
When its dark your the brightest
The shine of light that I need to write this
Your so righteous lets go mic this
Come with me hold tight like vices
I used to get so nervous
Just want you and I know thats selfish
And I know I am far from perfect
So maybe your love I dont deserve it
But I love this thing
Get on one knee just to show you a ring
You dont want me and its just a fling
Then hold up wait just let me sing like ok

Why you think that I do this 
Because I was told that I would be useless
I just drink and I think that I'm clueless
Why the hell did I put myself through this
Why make music
When at the end of the day it makes you sick
But you did choose it
You cant complain if you cant do it
And your lifes your mic 
Your pen when write all your pain and strife
Swear to god man it like

Its all yours [x3]

You know me but you aint met me
And sometimes you just forget me
I want to show you me you wont let me
Because you aint got the time to check me
So what do I do
Not saying I'm the best thats up to you
But its down to me and what I do
So check out Werd man check whats new
Yeah and I aint got to prove shit
When you still write bars saying that you sick
But if you just make music
Then you get a tick from me like just do it
Swoosh run tracks like NikeÂ’ies
But to get in that race it aint likely
No and they dont like me
But no single I'm still B-side you
And we could be together
Till then I be forever
In love with the useless pitch
In love with what this music biz
You know what music is
Just a release for my usual stress
Yes I'm a usual mess
So I just do what I do best

Why you think that I do this 
Because I was told that I would be useless
I just drink and I think that I'm clueless
Why the hell did I put myself through this
Why make music
When at the end of the day it makes you sick
But you did choose it
You cant complain if you cant do it
And your lifes your mic 
Your pen when write all your pain and strife
Swear to god man it like

Its all yours [x4]</pre>
