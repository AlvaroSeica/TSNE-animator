[Hugo]
Baby take a sip, watch how I do it
Mix some love potion in with your body fluid
Mami you the {shit}, minus the sewage
If you used to them lies say hi to the truest
Me, Boss, but you could call me Hugo
I play my cards right so I'm numero +Uno+
One, none, could compare to me, never
Boss man make you feel better
If any letter, I'm a G now, C/see how
The love potion got you shakin your knees out
Dress so chic, makin me wanna freak out
Potion like crack, makin your eyes speed dial
WOW!

[Interlude: Hugo]
I know, I know, baby you want it bad
Sip on it slow, it's the best you had
You know, you know, girl you likin that
I got, I got, I got, I got that

[Chorus: Hugo]
I got that love potion for you girl {*3X*}
For you girl, for you girl
I got the love potion for you girl {*3X*}
For you girl, for you girl

[Hugo]
Now I got you drunk off the potion, open, soakin
Your figure drippin, movin in slow motion
I, didn't know this love was this potent
Got the right tools if you say your heart broken
I'ma fix it, give you the business
Not Hershey chocolate Kisses and switch positions
Like, this what you been missin
Baby I'ma catch ya, even when you're slippin
Trip and fall, winter, spring, summer
Have ya bouncin like a kangeroo when ya boy took you down under
Wonder, how I get all of this bread
Love potion that I give, dick all in ya head
Like

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Hugo]
For you girl, for you girl
For you I've got that love potion
For you girl, for you girl
For you I've got that love potion

[Chorus]</pre>
