Tell em how you want it, want it
Tell em how you want it!
How you want it, how you want it
Tell me how you want it
How you want it, how you want it
Tell me how you want it baby
Want it, want it, want it
I said tell me how you want it baby
How you want it, how you want it

I say tell me how you want it baby!
Tell me how you want it, want it
Tell me how you want it!

I was thinking if you
Come over with yo crew
And I can jus call my niggas
And shit we can do whatever it do
Cause I know you, I mean I know me
Was trying spend a little time with you
And you was trying chill it with me
Cause baby I got that key, To your ignition
Nah I ain't tripping, Nah I ain't slipping
Nigga stay pimping, Nigga stay tripping
I jus ain't stressing, Nigga stay tripping
Cause I be testing
Cause I got money, dough, and all that shit
I just want you, all on my...
I ain't gonna curse, hit her with the herp
Put that pussy in a hearse, It's a nigga name Kirk
O, B, A, N, G
Put to the Z, Put yo ass to sleep
Put that ass to sleep, put that ass to sleep
Take that pill, put that ass to sleep
It's a nigga Kirko, Reppin H-Town
Gotta throw up that East

Tell me what you want, want
Tell me what you want!
What you want, what you want!
I say tell me what you want, want
What you want!
I say tell me how you want it, want it
How you want it!
I say tell me how you want it, want it, how you want it!
I say tell me how you want it, want it, how you want it!
Want it, want it!

Tell me what you want, want, want, want
I say tell me what you want
I say tell me how you want it, want it, want it
Tell me what you want, want, how you want it!
Want it, want it, want it!</pre>
