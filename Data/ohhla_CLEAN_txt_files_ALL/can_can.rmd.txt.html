[Intro: Clocka]
Uh! Make ya knees buckle nigga
I don't fuckin feel it
Clocka Dot and Angelou pull triggas with Reme-dy
(Yes we can can, yes we can can)
Yea, catch a kid, not
Speed one nigga
(Yes we can can, yes we can can)
(Yes we can can, yes we can can)

[Clocka]
Very strong word writer, chairmen of my pen
Don't waste no ink, regulated raw raps
Sound of New York City, firm legislature raps
For them niggas with gats who get busy
(Yes we can can, yes we can can)

[Lounge Mode]
Yo I'm posted with my Nike Flights
Money nice, crack bags are fatter than your wife's ass
Plus cash to move with, the outta town +CREAM+ getter
Clear the scene spitter, doin things that I normally do

[Remedy]
Yo, we jump out the vans like SWAT on some "take what you got"
We on some real live +Pillage+ shit and flee from the spot
It's the Remedy like it or not
Yo you rappers are my enemy, I hope you die and you rot
(Yes he can can)

[Lounge Mode]
For all you bitch mothafuckas want beef, so come and take mine
Come and test me, I hold my fort down and feel questly
Live from the Killa Hill jets, ain't nothin changed
From +Protect Ya Neck+, now I'm doin shows with Inspectah Deck

[Clocka]
I got professional dancehall status than the average
Known to +Tear Da Club Up+, 16 shot semi-automatic
Let go through metro politics
Left big holes and shit, blood on ya outfit

[Remedy]
Turn up the bass, check out my melody and doubt it's the God
I'm lettin knowledge be born and my name's the R
E-M-E-D-Y sent from a-far, a Wu Killa Bee on a 6-sided star
Yes we can can

[Chorus 2X: Lounge Mode]
Everythin is love in the clubs, we sell drugs
(Yes we can can, yes we can can)
Shots and slugs, one time buck shots for thugs
(Yes we can can, yes we can can)

[Lounge Mode]
Yo what's the low budget dust in the Dutch that got me fucked up
and twisted, you better believe I got the biscuit
Othorized slash Rem-D slash +Pillage+
I'ma kill it, soon as you talk I'm in ya skillet

[Remedy]
From the concentration camp we went straight to the ramp
Put my face in the stamp, '88 BB champ (BBC!)
Rem-D find me in the H buildin but don't waste ya time lookin
I keep shit cookin

[Lounge Mode]
I'm at the midtown and tellin 'em, "About to get down"
and how it went down when me and Clocka Dot, we had to spit rounds
Broke the car and jumped out, jetted then we pumped out
Every last round in the clip and left 'em slumped out

[Remedy]
You wack like a mob contract, catch a body
Like Tommy Ballotti, 4-5ths to Louisvilles
+Shoot to Kill+, still never ran, never will
The Remedy gets you open like them pigs in the Pill'

(Yes we can can, yes we can can) - 4X

[Lounge Mode]
The word from the WB, they said it's actin
These bouncers frontin at +The Tunnel+, on to Staten
Killa Bamz spit out, Bobby all Diged out
Wild Baneen Method Man night, I got kicked out

[Remedy]
Yo just when you thought it was safe to make records
We right dead smack in ya face in 10 seconds (Yes we can can)
Slingers and guns, ain't nothin funny
Reformulate, build with the Queen and drill honey

[Lounge Mode]
I walked off like I'm Lucky Hands
Yo who the fuck wanna touch my man?
Twin guns in the sand hidden
God forbid it, if you fuck around you lay around
Red infrared light was on point and spittin

[Remedy]
Now to the know, the free man banned and understanded (Yes we can can)
Everythin's love up in the club man
The green Bud man on some American Bandstand (Yes we can can)
I'm in the club, come show me some love man

(Yes we can can, yes we can can) -- 20X

[Outro: Lounge Mode]
Yea nigga, word nigga
You hear me talkin
Rem-D slash Othorized slash +Pillage+
Midtown went to get down
Yo WB, East Barracks
Nahmean? Shaolin baby
Wilda Baneeni, Styler Baneeni
Wilda Baneeni..</pre>
