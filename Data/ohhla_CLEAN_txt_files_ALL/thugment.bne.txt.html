[Chorus]
T-H-U-G we be, that's thug mentality 
we thuggin, thuggin thuggin 
that's the way I chose to live my life

T-H-U-G we be, that's thug mentality 
we thuggin, thuggin thuggin 
thuggin till the day I die

T-H-U-G we be, that's thug mentality 
we thuggin, thuggin thuggin 
that's the way I chose to live my life

T-H-U-G we be, that's thug mentality 
we thuggin, thuggin thuggin 
thuggin till the day I die

I done been around da world and everywhere be da same song
niggas struggle daily, gotta survive, its worldwide
even niggas in Paris n London be hustlin doin whatever to get the money
Looking at the whole big wide world ??? mighty thugs ???
But you gotta keep it real if you wanna make it, do ???
And make a ??? kids
Gotta handle your business, gotta get in it to win it
And then you gotta get up out of there baby
And that's real, really, my thugs feel me
put your fists up in the air, yeah
Nigga comin' to the war and I'm a meet you niggas there
Ready to rumble, and I swear, we're comin' from everywhere
Where my thugs at? Where they at? Fuck that! 
Nigga let's do in the enemy now
Terminate, eliminate 'em, I'm takin' out the frustration on the world
Get 'em back for the playa hation
So come on we gotta roll, and wouldn't you know?
They ain't ready for the war, pop the ??? get arrested
To the po-po, you in total control, 
make 'em feel the pain in two-double-oh-oh
It's the end of the road, so what you gon' do?
I'm a ride till we die, if you want to, (run too)
Would all them real soldiers, come on move
Get your suits on, boots on, keep troopin' on
T-H-U-G, U-G, that's what we be, across the nation
Pump your fists and get ready for this occasion
Think you'd better fade on, Bone wanna see victory
Y'all niggas better roll with this
Cause we splittin' 'em, fuck that, we winnin', that's thug mentality

[Chorus]

Be a thug, if you wanna be a thug, be a thug if you got to
Throw it up, keep it in the air, scream it out
Thug, thug, thug, thug, thuggin' till the day I die
When I'm high if you look into my eyes, you'll truly find
No kind like I, Gemini, and it controls both sides
My Lord he law, maintain, hard cause I'm a soldier at war
Steady runnin' with the weapons cause it still ain't gettin' better
Figured it out, it's all real, and if it ain't then it ain't right
Come on, if you wanna feel the thug love
And it's real, we got the real thing baby
I hate to burn you, learn you, stay out of it if it don't concern you
You don't really wanna get involved with the murder
But shit, if you want it, you got it, we bring it, it don't stop
We gon' pop shots still to the double glock-glock
Never takin' no shorts, no losses mayn
Yes, these days it's still the same like, gotta make that money, mayn
Bang, gotta get down for my thang, and I do it so smooth
When I'm stalkin' gatt fools, walkin jack moves
And I'm on the run widda me shotgun, but a ??? it's on
Ya'll can't fuck with the thuggish ruggish, ruggish
bone, bone, bone bone bone - that's thug mentality

[Chorus]
