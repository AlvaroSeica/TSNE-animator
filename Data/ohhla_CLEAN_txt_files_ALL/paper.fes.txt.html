Typed by: Cno Evil

[Fes Taylor]
I get money all over the states
So I can see the hate all over your face
Fade off on the jakes, fans they see me in the Lamborghini
Got bitches with tans in bikinis
Seas like pans of ziti, NYPD
My NYC D's got wolves that'll shoot you for three g's
Son you better hope I squeeze freeze, fuck if I get locked up
Know I'm going home like E.T.
I got bail money, fresh off the block, still money
Put away in a shoe box and steal from me
I take fingers in exchange, my niggas in the game
Never been afraid to stick you with a blade
How can I be broke as hell
When I can hit the block hard, son, I got coke to sale
My last name should of been Paper
Cuz everytime I spit, it's like I'm giving you tips like you a waiter

[Chorus: Fes Taylor w/ Mr. Prezident ad-libs]
You getting money right? (Cop this yeah, drop a top)
Them is 20's right? (Stop this year, don't know when to stop)
Aiyo the honeys like (cop this year, watch the rocks)
I said you hungry right? (Hell yeah)

[Hook: Mr. Prezident]
Aiyo, I'm just getting this paper, the more that we make, bro
Just love how these niggas'll hate cha
A car, truck, house and some acres, we won't let it break us
Got rings like we play for the Lakers

[Mr. Prezident]
Time has come for the Gov, to get that run
So Fantom keeps begging me to give him my gun
Dog it ain't easy in the slums where I'm from
I done did a lot of things when I was slinging up jums
So I keep the mack on me, to keep them cats off me
Black stay flossy, you don't wanna cross me
The Benz lean mean, birds fly when I'm cruising by
See you dudes looking, ya'll schemin' with a crooked eye
Yea, the bracelet's the basics, so tight, you can taste it
Reached at your home where your face is
Face it, respect it, matter fact, embrace it
My necklace is grayish like white girl's braces
Button up Mioshis, old school aces
Can't forget the watch, cop bully box laced it
Holla at your boy if ya stash get low
Now I can show ya'll muthafuckas how to ge this dough

[Chorus]
