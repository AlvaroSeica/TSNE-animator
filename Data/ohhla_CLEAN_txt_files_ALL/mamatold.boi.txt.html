[Big Boi] + (Kelly Rowland)
(Big Boi!)
Kelly!

As the world shakes unharmed
Twan, calm in the middle of the storm bomb
Flow tsunami, ring the alarm
Big Boi for dummies come and get some
Uhh, wisdom, like yo back teeth
or get the fuck on, like some bad chi
Negative energy not tolerated
You all about a dollar and I'm exonerated
Freefallin', Tom Petty heartbreaker
Living legend, rap scholar, art major
Cause I make major art
Like Beethoven, Van Gogh, or Mozart, so don't start
Around these parts we reign supreme
And stay Krispy Kreme clean
Blue jeans, Jordans
Number 3's, that's important

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Be careful how you play your cards (That's What Mama told me)
Be true to self and you'll go far (That's what Mama told me)
Try not to break too many hearts (That's what Mama told me)
I always knew I'd be a star (That's what Mama told me)

[Big Boi]
Mama used to say take your time
Well, I'm a pickpocket when I design rhymes
Every little step I take like Bob Brown
It's so profound that when I throw those nouns
We goin' get low low down until we get back up
Everything gravy, taters mashed up
You know I keep a full plate
And a full thing of hot ones, throw away .38s
But everything's straight, bleed, shit
I got everything I can need
Me, boy, I'm everythin' you can't see
Like Three Blind Mice, on the chase of some great cheese
And Cheddar Man say he got some great trees
Say he serve me and my nigga Three G
Butt tees, Jordans
Number five, you niggas borin'

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Be careful how you play your cards (That's what Mama told me)
Be true to self and you'll go far (That's what Mama told me)
Try not to break too many hearts (That's what Mama told me)
I always knew I'd be a star (That's what Mama told me)

[Kelly Rowland] + (Big Boi)
Cause I travel like a rocket, I do
Mind riddle every socket for you
I sway on the edge of the lightning
Yeah!
Magnetic, can't stop
Just floatin' won't drop
I slip (I slip) I slide (I slide)
Back up the ride
I skippin' every mountaintop
I'm reachin' for the highest high

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Be careful how you play your cards (That's what Mama told me)
Be true to self and you'll go far (That's what Mama told me)
Try not to break too many hearts (That's what Mama told me)
I always knew I'd be a star (That's what Mama told me)</pre>
