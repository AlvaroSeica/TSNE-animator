[Hodgy Beats]
Bitch I got my rights and I got two guns
and a pocket knife, yeah I cocked it twice
You have dropped it, ice, stopped the rice
Ox eat rice, vegetables
I can't kill 'em all but this semi's able
Cannibal eat a nigga off of any table
Brain poured your labels 'til my pour is faithful
No average payroll nigga work your kingdom
Money by the millons, money by the hours
Drugs in the bathtub, money in the shower
Check it early riser, O.F. bang louder
Arouse ya, bitch when I begin to crowd around her
Then think to my thesis, caught up in a prefix
Music is premixed, the remix, with guns sounds
and gun rounds and brief kicks
Call it the remix of the bible, influenced by Jesus

[Chorus]
I'm coming to kill 'em all, gunnin to kill 'em all
Hollows they feel 'em all, bananas I peel 'em all
Pussy don't get involved, ligaments will dissolve
Problems I will resolve, niggaz I will revolve
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all

[Hodgy Beats]
I keep work like observers who watch workers workin serve them
Listen to every word and try their best not to be a burden
I met her she was a virgin, until I cut her like a neuro brand surgeon
Hip-Hop riding, I'm swervin, take her to rodeo but she can't find mervyns
We high priced sailing, high like scalin
We on fire, you trailin if I'm fresh, you stale then
Put me on figures as I peddle with my my niggaz
Notice my fan base gettin a tad bigger
We start shit and burn the Swisher
Iron the creases, I'm a T while them other bitch twist up
The calm and collected, my rhymes are perfected
I'm comin for the throne, not your diamond or necklace

[Chorus]

[Jasper]
Kill 'em all motherfucker
Odd Future Wolf Gang
Taking everybody out the motherfuckinz business
Young niggaz doin it big, MellowHype
Free Earl, fuck Everybody
Wolf Gang nigga
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill 'em all! </pre>
