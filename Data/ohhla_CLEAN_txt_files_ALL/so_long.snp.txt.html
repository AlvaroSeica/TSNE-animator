[Chorus: Snoop Lion]
So long, we been on this journey, and I know we can make it
Stay strong, our hearts been yearnin, and no one can break it
Round and round, our world keeps turnin, no one can stop the time
It's just another bridge we crossin, keep this message, in your souls and lives

[Verse One: Snoop Lion] (Angela Hunte)
They try to break, our bond (But what they didn't know)
That we we're built, so strong (Yeah, they didn't know)
Within their hearts and minds, we we're done (They said we we're a no show) 
(Baby don't you cry) For as long as I'm alive, you'll live

[Chorus: Snoop Lion]
So long, we been on this journey, and I know we can make it
Stay strong, our hearts been yearnin, and no one can break it
Round and round, our world keeps turnin, no one can stop the time
It's just another bridge we crossin, keep this message, in your souls and lives

[Verse Two: Snoop Lion] (Angela Hunte)
If I should die tonight (I'll be happy that I knew you)
If I should lose my sight (I'll still hold on with all my might)
With all the words and fights, still can get it right, yeahhhhhhh!!!!
(Baby don't you cry) For as long as I'm alive, you'll live

[Chorus: Snoop Lion]
So long, we been on this journey, and I know we can make it
Stay strong, our hearts been yearnin, and no one can break it
Round and round, our world keeps turnin, no one can stop the time
It's just another bridge we crossin, keep this message, in your souls and lives
So long, we been on this journey, and I know we can make it
Stay strong, our hearts been yearnin, and no one can break it
Round and round, our world keeps turnin, no one can stop the time
It's just another bridge we crossin, keep this message, in your souls and lives
