Verse 1
I know your tired of bouncin so check this here
we got tha back breakin club shakin beat for this year
yeah..so peep the steelo and the flow
I gotcha head noddin cuz your neck already knows
so pass the mic and watch Skillz rip fast
and have niggas up in parties catchin whiplash
slash the wack..who tryin to bite my style
take yo ass to da old school
and part your fuckin eyebrows
I comin through to
about to get set
so act like WU..Protect that Neck
I still calm..Im still tendin to the song
I be blowin up spots like I was sendin out mailbombs
stya calm and be noddin see
Im like a black president(why)
cuz niggas aint seein me
has beens they both like bad skinz so face it
after this joint yo we passin out some neck braces

Chorus
I gotcha head noddin cuz your neck knows it phat
check it out like this and then like that
[Repeat *4]

Verse2

My track packs enery like nuclear reactors
I be Mad Skillz and this be the Nod Factor
after Mc's smoke me take a toke
I'll fuck your career like the cast on Diffrent Strokes
no joke..I see airlines and start aimin rhymes
My shit will have hard niggas in soul train lines
bumpin wit this big black broad named Belinda
oh you rap dont say jack 
and walk quiet like a ninja
I injure..beats so you can expect to go to Cairo
so I can practice checkin that neck and got set
cuz guess what I'm the one to set it
you regret it
cuz my beats employin paramedics
I wet it
yeah and it will stay that way
I know you'll be back
you probably got some rhymes on lay away
But I be here freakin fat funk to make you sweat
do me a favor
and tell your neck that I aint finished yet

Chorus(Repeat *4)


Verse 3

I perfect raps stick in under your skin
either your noddin by now
or your dead or a mannequin
my friend resistin aint good for ya health
put your tool on the shelf
and just go for self
Get help..get da drink and get the hidin
get your groove on
before he get gis glock and gat up the party like Gotti
I'm runnin thangs from the inside
rap better wait because your style done died
And let you corny-spiderman Mc's sayin nuthin
put your clothes on backwards if you feel like frontin
Im huntin for beats/on point like cleets
wit da brand new sound
you can pump in ya jeeps..It be the Nod Factor
rollin hard like tecs
Im Skillz for real
bringin it to you somethin stank
this track will be in ya ear
like new wax/now max
and tell your neck veins to relax...
