[Chorus 2X: Fes Taylor]
I need a bitch that'll ride for a nigga, like
She don't want ice, she just ride the dick all night
You know the simple things in life, like
Nibble on the nipples, busting on her dimples

[Fes Taylor]
Bitch you fronting like I ain't hold ya raggedy ass down
Heard you running round town like Raggedy Ann now
And threesomes, and please 'em, and go for round two when the weed down
She said she need freedom from her baby daddy, he talk alotta shit
Said he was crazy coming at me, cuz I'm the shit
Fuck if I'm rich, I ain't got a trick
He got alotta cash, good, I got alotta dick
No use in sweets and shopping in botiques
Try to get you in them sheets, you a locker room freak
Was a high school jump off, graduated celebrity
Niggas getting they nuts off
But of course, they say love cost, so it's buttersoft
Leather in the plush porsche, I just dust off
Pussy got cobwebs on it, ma, who want it?
Stretchmarks on your belly, but still you flaunt it
Your ass got fatter, it really don't matter
Cuz her head game good with me

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
