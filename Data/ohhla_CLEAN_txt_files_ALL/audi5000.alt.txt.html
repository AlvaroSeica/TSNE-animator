[A.L.T.]
(Verse 1)
I once knew a bitch named Mercedes Benz
Her and Lexus
Wanted to sex me and all my friends
Damn
You want it
You got it
Toyota
I gave Impala a holla because he's got the mota
About a pound
And so we rolled slow
Plus I kept my eyes out for five point O
We got to the pad about MR2
I said, "I've never met a Jetta that was fly as you"
Lexus, she was heavy as a Chevy, but it ain't no thang
Because we gang bang, rode 'em like a Mustang
And I'm thinking that you got my point
I told Impala
To roll up a Corrola joint
And then, I passed out
She said, "I doesn't want to trouble you
But BMW's home now, and so you assed out
And my heart started poundin'
I'm out the back window
Peace homegirls, but I'm Audi 5000

Hook: Tony G.
"Monte Carlos, El Dogs and Caddy Coups" --&gt; Scarface
"Drop Monte Carlos, El Dogs and Caddy Coups"
"Drop Monte Carlos, El Dogs and Caddy Coups"
"Drop Monte Carlos, El Dogs and Caddy Coups"

(Verse 2)
I got a friend named Alfa Romero
Who rolled a Fiero with a girl named Camaro
And he calls her his sidekick
But the bitch is so fly that he gotta have a big dick
We all jetted in the Jetta
Then we got harrassed by a cop named Berreta
He pulled us over
In a fucked up Nova
Then we saw my homie roll right by, his name is Range Rover
He swoop on the Trooper
He's tight with the mob
And then he made the one time stop
Peace homie, thanks, and I'll see ya
Then I got a page from my bitch, Carmen Gia
"Come and pick me up," so I crawl through the city
I'm 'bout to get some ass and a whole lot of titty
I got to her pad
And yo, I started poundin'
I'd like to tell you more homeboy, but I'm Audi 5000

Repeat Hook

(Verse 1)
I partied with this oriental girl named Hundai
Who kicks it with this Japanese bitch they call Samurai
I headed to the liquor store, word
I got a fifth of Surburban and some Thunderbird
I said, "I'll be right back"
Then, I saw a friend who's a pimp, big and black
We called him Caddilac
Just to tease
I told my nigga, "Freeze"
He drove a Lamborghini that cost three hundred Z's
And let's jet out to Club Pantera
Hatchbacks kickin' it, and so was Fiera
And it sounded like a switch
I got to the club and met a snobby ass bitch
Who said I was the voice
She said I was the choice
And could I please
Give a little bit to Ms. Royce Royce
Silk sheets and my hips, they was poundin'
Then I got the fuck out of Dodge, cause I was Audi 5000

Repeat Hook Twice</pre>
