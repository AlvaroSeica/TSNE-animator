[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Hey...
I'm a little teapot short and stout
There's some shake-up in around me know it's talking about
I pop the lid the lid, its gon be me I'm gonna let it out
Nothing'll happen if I don't open my mouth
I ain't a punk bitch, I don't give a fuck
I'm just being me and speakin' from the gut
Well its a little bit of us, a whole lot of you,
And we just came here to see what it do...

[Chorus]
I'm right here, and I ain't goin' nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I ain't goin' nowhere
You can knock doors and tear gas the air so...
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to

[Verse 2: Shae]
I'm a little teapot blowin' off steam
You put me on the heat, I don't whistle I scream
Bang, bang, fuck a bed fuck a dream
This is rage blowin' up your machine
I'm a star bitch, I don't give a fuck
Don't be surprised when this bitch start blowin' up
Well its a little bit of us, a whole lot of you
And we just came here to see what it do...

[Chorus]
I'm right here, and I ain't goin' nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I ain't goin' nowhere
You can knock doors and tear gas the air so...
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to

[Bridge: Pharrell]
And now I'm wakin up layin' in the ambulance bed
With somethin in my arm, I gotta get it off
A tattoo with a line that'll read your mind
And next is your mind, I gotta get it off
The shit they spray attack my lungs everyday
With a creeping decay, I gotta get it off
By attacking these things, I earnt my wings
And my halo but first I gotta, get it off

[Chorus x2]
I'm right here, and I ain't goin' nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I ain't goin' nowhere
You can knock doors and tear gas the air so...
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to</pre>
