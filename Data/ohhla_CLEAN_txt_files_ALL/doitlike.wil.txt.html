Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Aha aha okay
Aha aha okay

Come on!
He-eh-eh-eh-ey
Aw a-aw, aw a-aw
[x2]

Now when I take off my shades
Please don't be shocked by my age
I'm taking over the game
Now will I scare you?
Will I scare you?
Boo!

My parents left me home alone
They left me home alone
It's time to pick up the phone
And tell my friends come on!

Somebody ring the alarm
You better ring the alarm
Come follow me and my drummers
Blow the speakers out!

I can feel it
Feel the drums taking over control
I feel it deep in my soul
Can you feel it?
Feel this feel that sets you all in my zone
Now watch me rock it out!

I make the rockstars and the popstars
Wanna do it like
Wa-wa-wanna do it like me (like me)
Cause all you rockstars, the topstar
Wanna do it like
Don't you wanna do it like me?

Now, watch how I break it down
You know I'm not new in town
Don't lower your speakers now
Will I scare you, will I scare you?
Boo!

Now everybody hands in the air
Now keep 'em up in the air
Now wave 'em like you don't care
We 'bout to set it off!

Haters scream on top of your lungs
Until your tonsils get numb
The way I rock on the zone
Will make you shout it out

I can feel it
Feel the drums taking over control
I feel it deep in my soul
Can you feel it?
Feel this feel that sets you all in my zone
Now watch me rock it out!

I make the rockstars and the popstars
Wanna do it like
Wa-wa-wanna do it like me (like me)
Cause all you rockstars, the topstar
Wanna do it like
Don't you wanna do it like me?

Now I just wanna let my hair down, let my hair down, rock it out
Making people scream and shout, watch me how I wild it out
[x2]

I make the rockstars and the popstars
Wanna do it like
Wa-wa-wanna do it like me (like me)
Cause all you rockstars, the topstar
Wanna do it like
Don't you wanna do it like me?

I can feel it
Feel the drums taking over control
I feel it deep in my soul
Can you feel it?
Feel this feel that sets you all in my zone
Now watch me rock it out!
Watch me rock it out!
Now watch me rock it out!
Watch me rock it out!
Now watch me rock it out!

Aha aha okay</pre>
