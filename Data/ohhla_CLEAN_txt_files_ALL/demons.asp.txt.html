[Intro]
I just, I just live
I live day by day
Fightin demons

[ASAP Rocky]
I smoked away my brain, I think I'm goin dumb
Cocaine up on my gums, I think they're goin numb
I'm having stomach pains, man I'm throwin up
Cause I'm a microphone fiend, give me the bass
Give me the beat, and let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream
Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King, with a dream
That one day, that my team, we can make it with this rappin
Now we swaggin, makin money in Manhattan, trick what's happenin?!
They try to intellect with indirections just to test you
A rebel 'til my death it's in my flesh it's in my vessels
Fuck the clique you with I'm fin' to fuck the bitch you next to
Fuck a metrosexual, suck a dick, I'm disrespectful~!
You know the kid get it, get-get sick spit
Clip spit, quick split, shit hit kids women
Oh that's your girl huh? Well I just hit it
It's ASAP nigga live with it

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
These demon thoughts they start to drown me Lord don't leave me all alone

[ASAP Rocky]
{Aw, yeah... aw, yeah...} let the beat chill {*3X*}
Hipster by heart, but I can tell you how the streets feel

[Chorus]</pre>
