Yeah, Philly in this bitch!
Loso waddup?

[Meek Mill]
Check me
I from the city where the skinny niggas ride
Where a Semi.45 would make the biggest niggas fold up, roll up
I done seen the realest niggas froze up
When that Mack squeezing hollows leave your back
Leaking that, act decent if you want to, everytime I come through
Everybody whispering, talking what gon do
Hundred grand in straight cash
Make me put it on you and have your own homies tryna swarm you
I'm sworn to riding with this Glock.40
And I got it on, too
They tell me to put it down
But they don't know what I'm going through
Niggas playing checkers and it's chess
So what's a pawn to a king that got his money right?
You niggas on a hunger strike
When I was dead-broke, man, I used to grind a hundred a nights
A hundred day, selling white, I tell you it ain't nothing nice
I be going so hard, man I don't see my son at night
Baby mama bitching, I'm just trying to get my young'un right
Started with a dollar to a half a ticket
And I just signed my deal today
For all you rapping niggas. Money ain't a joke
You see me laughing niggas?
All my goonies they ain't talking, they just clapping niggas
You gonna think my dogg a roofer, brought a ladder with him
My other homie a mechanic, got his ratchet with him
And they shooting for real, they shooting to kill
I got some homies up state, they doing the wheel
I remember niggas shooting for dear life
30 years on us, cops pull with the red lights
We riding with them hammers
Know a couple young'uns that died before their grandma
I'm not trying to play with hammers
A lot of niggas fronted back when I was in the slammer
But now I got that paper in and I be going bananas
Like Tony Montana, Nino and the Carter got me leaning even harder
With this Nina in my cargoes
I can't meet 'em any farther
If the niggas want the work
Tell 'em meet me out North, 20-something in Berks
Used to be with 50 niggas, 20 of 'em got murked
20 done turned pussy, the other 10 put in work
Yeah! I'm screaming "this is the life"
If you ain't hooping then you whipping the white
They even hitting the pipe
I talked to 'em try to give them advice
Niggas get left, they wasn't living too right...
Yea! Niggas get left, they wasn't living too right

Y'all don't really hear me tho...</pre>
