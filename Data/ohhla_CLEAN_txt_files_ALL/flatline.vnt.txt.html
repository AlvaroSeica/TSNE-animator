[Vents]
Yeah.. Trigger Fist, Vents One, Balboa
You know what this is, check it out..
My rhyme will cause heart disease
We move like star police after bomb blasts that plagued the Balinese
Half the streets is war-torn
My thought born style deforming soil you walk on
My fork on a leg of +Lamb+, the death metal band
Yeah, we raising limbs to praise pentagrams
You met a man that lost faith
Chumps running up in my crib for the gems that's in the locked safe
Robbing octaves, chopping breaks balaclava clad
This ain't a passing fad
From Peepshow to Breaking Tooth, we the army that shake the roof
The example of wasted youth
I could make you move with the power
of a powder charge from a shotgun blast
Submachine rhymes from the depths of real shit
I burst to kill quick, ya dig?

[Chorus: Sample]
"Flatline" {*5X*}

[Robby Balboa]
..Yo I sip on a glass of B, in a bar full of LSD
Punk on a path of Chi
Pass the e-ffects, I wreck
Check your neck for the technique, dissect the beat
My brain like a cell that's starved for heat
Best friend like a carcass, carve the meat
I'm hungry, looking like Dahmer the cannibal
Crushing the skulls in the arms of mechanical
Pull the switch and I flatline
Centrelink queues to look for your smack find
Another life to waste, the piper plays to the rat race
Catch a case of the bullshit
You paid for a bitch to dance in your film clip
Where's the real shit? Here's the duct tape
Chill for sixteen bars with a nutcase
Watch Video Hits, twist to a flick on a snuff tape

[Chorus: Sample]
"Flatline" {*4X*}

[Vents]
Check it out yo..
Yeah, ay, yo ... I flatline and rebirth
Emerge from the dirt, return to pervert
Invert the cross, burn your boss
Tame the beast, teach police, forgive the priest
Don't send no stealth bomber for peace
Impeach the prez, that's self-defence
We'll give the land back, don't sell the rest
It's Vents on the rise, no compromise
Bloodbath the plan, you democratised
Now, I got a four-door Ford that run
on the blood from somebody's wife daughter and son
Now you wonder why they blowing us up
But look at the flash when the bomb drop, stay low then duck
Fuck the beef, I need some time to breathe
Cut a few ties, run a few miles and leave
the dogs to bark, talking that yap-yap
You ain't cutting nobody, that's that
Make your heart flatline ...
