Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you

[Slow Pain]
Dear God, oh, Father
Here me out, one time
With the strenght and the courage, to really speak my mind
I'm going blind, doin' time
I don't mean to be rude
Excuse me, thank you, then I always bless my food
I made a promise to myself, to keep my music true
And if I saved a life a soul
Then Glory be to you
I'm on the freeway, driving
Thinking 'bout my life
For my mother and my father
I gotta thank you twice
Teardrops falling
In the fast lane
I'm going crazy everyday
And I can't stand the pain
Light a candle on my dresser
Hoping for the best
Say a prayer everynight, you're like my bulletproof vest-ah

Chorus: Diamonique
Dear mother, I love you
So much
More today
Than yesterday
Than any words
Can ever say
Dear mother, I love you
So much
More today
Than yesterday
Than any words
Can ever say

[Slow Pain]
I'm a little older now
A little bolder now
And it ain't about the money, I'm from the shoulders now
What up S.G.V
You my brother forever
You been right there, ridin' shotgun
Through all the rough weather
Steve Vallala, keep your promise, you made in the church
You'll be there for my kids
When I'm gone, and it hurts
Help my babies be strong, playa, daddy's home, then I'm gone
Protect 'em in life
Show 'em right from wrong
My brother Bones, what could I say?
You made me so proud
Keep it going, big dog, I got your back in the clouds
Don't let no one get you down
It's all I got say
And when the hard times come
You just gotta pray
Come on

[Chorus] - 2X

[Slow Pain]
I woke up from a dream, feeling good about my life
See my three girls smilin', kiss the lips of my wife
I said a prayer last night
Before I fell asleep
Dear God, bless my kids, and keep the evil out the streets
Heal the sick and the needy
Don't forget about the hungry
If forever make it big time, they can have all my money
Keep the dad's out the pens so they could raise the children
A father to a son
Always makes a better man
To my mother, how I love you
Words can't explain
And to my pops, see my smile when you feel the Slow Pain
I wanna thank you ten times
For your knowledge and your love
You must've been an angel from the heavens up above

[Bridge: Diamonique]
I wanna thank you (For loving me)
To mother, thank you (Oh, for hugging me)
Oh, father, thank you (Oh, for all my babies)
Everything you've given me
I wanna thank you (For loving me)
To mother, thank you (Oh, for hugging me)
Oh, father, thank you (Oh, for all my babies)
For everything you've given me

[Chorus] - 2X

[Diamonique]
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you</pre>
