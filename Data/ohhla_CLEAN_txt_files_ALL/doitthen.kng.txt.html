[Intro: Sharecka]
Round, round, and... (Yeah, K-Rhyme music)
Round, round, and...
Round, round and when he talkin' (Hoodtrepenuers, Cyborg Nation)
{*chorus starts here in the background}
Hoodtrepeneurs, Cyborg Nation, yeah!
Yup, yup, yup...
Round, round, and, runnin' his mouth talkin'
Listen, yo...

[Chorus 2X: Sharecka]
Lot of niggaz always talk about what they gonna do
But they ain't gon' do a damn thing
Always talkin' 'bout who they gon' kill, who they gon' shoot
Go 'head, nigga, do it then (Do it then, what, do it then)
(What, do it then, what, do it then, please)

[Sharecka]
Who the fuck y'all think y'all talkin' to?
When y'all walkin' through and we ridin' through
Tryin' to, bendin' gear tryin' to get paid of sentences here
Y'all really know you wanna spit like this
That shit'll never happen, kid
Think about practicin', me at a show I'ma pack it in
The after party, had to make it with groupies
Shakin' their bodies, tons of bottles
Lots of chronic, hundred acres so it's not so crowded
Less men, more women, in Mount the Olympic
At the bottom it's tinted, with my signature in it
Now remember, I gotta pat myself a bone in the back
Cuz I done turned my life around, and I done did it
That paper chasin', that paper makin', I'm ridin' with it
I ain't go no time for bitches, no time for nigga, but time for digits
If you want a track, I could go check Link, cuz his sound's the realest
I don't know what y'all niggaz thought but we surrounded by killas
From the streets of BK, VA, TA, the South of Philly
Everywhere we go, we hot, that's how ya bound to feel me, what?

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Sharecka]
WHOOOOOOA!!!</pre>
