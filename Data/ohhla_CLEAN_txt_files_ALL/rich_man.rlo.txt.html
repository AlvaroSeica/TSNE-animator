(Rack-Lo)
I'm filthy rich I got bank accounts and large amounts
CD's, stocks and barns, presidential suites
Property on War Street, playing for high stakes
6 billion dollar estate, money to waste

(Thirstin Howl III)
I'm a poor man so I put a gun to your face
to take two things, your life, and a dead presidential briefcase
Empty your safe for everything you got, mansion and a yacht
Vehicles out on the parking lot already sold
At the swap shop, my client I is an undercover cop
Making deals underneath the table
I either be him or a poor man, can nobody save you?

(Rack-Lo)
I'm a rich man it's not my fault
You live in the slums of New York
Let's beat like a criminal when you talk criminal slang
Stick me up now; what goes around comes around like a boomerang

(Thirstin Howl III)
Hang mare, I hang your high
The day I was born I was ready to die
Lie commit fraud and cheat
The bottom line I gotta eat
Dead beat that, 5 years probation
Completed 4 and a half, got violated twice
Shoot dice, place your bets
I see cats with teeth and wore, murder suicide and sex

(Rack-Lo)
Too bad I see ugly signatures on corporate cheques
I relieve scholars Harvard graduates
Commit white dollars crimes behind enemy lines
You can read about it Monday, New York Times

(Thirstin Howl III)
I'm a poor man poverty hit the lottery
High school drop out, independent hip hop economy
Homeless, walk males like Ghandi, diamond district

(Rack-Lo)
Life styles of the rich and famous without Robin Leech
Private jet planes with my colleagues
Sniff cocaine, overdose like Curt Kobain
Above the clouds, richer than Liberace
Down with illuminati, n-w-o c-e-o
Control alcohol, tobacco, the world is mine
Plant time bombs

(Thirstin Howl III)
Oh yeah really
Not if I burn ya empire down like Waco
You wear Rolex I wear Swatch tomics or Seiko
I live in the ghetto, you live in the suburbs
I grew up with thugs you grew up with nerds
I'm not gonna be poor for long mark my words
County of Kings, I got big dreams in two years
You can see my face on Tv screens

(Rack-Lo)
So rich I own a time machine
Helicopters, submarines, cbs, mvc
MTV, BET, exquisite split sonian exhibit

(Rack-Lo)
Poor man so I am stingy like hysterics
A thin like between love and hate, swindle swords
Got tricks up my sleeve like white boys on skate boards
I got a duffle bag full of 39 38 specials 37 watches
with diamond embezzles, double impact, cameras
Take 35millimeter fill by Kodak
Quicken officers which trench coats like Kojak
(ah negative please, that's the service)</pre>
