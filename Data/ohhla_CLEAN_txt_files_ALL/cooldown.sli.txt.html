Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Skankin' little momma know right down for the rhythm i'm gon' feel you
Bottom droppin' out you're
Bound to get another
Maybe one or two
Woman lookin' good you know that is my woman
She come cool me down
Gotta love life
Cause life be lovin' me
Now we say cool right now
You gotta say yeah yeah
You gotta say yeah yeah
Sometimes
My mind
Be driftin'
Further
Every
Single
Muther fuckin' day

But in my house
All the writings on the wall rastafari
Sit up on his throne
Said his eyes if it were fire
For i see him he's no liar'
Defending the weak and the poor and the fatherless
In my house
All the writings on the wall rastafari
Sit up on his stone
Say skankin' little momma know right down for the rhythm i'm gon' feel you
Woman lookin' good you know there is another
And you know that's true
Woman lookin' good you know she is so fine because
She cool me down
Gotta love life
Life be lovin' me
Now we say cool right now
Yeah yeah
You gotta say
You gotta say yeah yeah
You gotta say yeah yeah
Whoa whoa</pre>
