Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Keely]
I feel good
I feel wonderful
And it's because
You made it that way
I feel supa spectacular because of you

Now I'm flying
I think I'm floating
I feel so high
Your love leads me to the sky
And if I fall I won't care
Cause I'm safe with you

Cause I'm in love (with your) story
Need I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin' (lalalala) I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you

[Big Sean]
Now baby your the truth so I'm just being honest
You treat me like a king so that's why your my highness
That means queen
Seems I known you for the longest
Funny how we connected on the low like Vonage (huh)
And I know it ain't as deep as it could be
Or as it would be but that's how it should be
Cause overtime we gonna be fine like wine
I never put another ova mine
See difference between you and them is they just wanna shine and
Well you
You just want Sean
So tell mama sandy, mama myra and that family
That when I get that grammy, they gon' be a granny
And if I see that reaper b4 you see that reaper
Just know I love you every time you hear me thru them speakers and I'ant tryna blow your head up like reefa but we got chemistry to the point we need a
Beaker.

[Keely]
So promise that you'll keep me
Promise you won't lead astray
Promise me forever promise me to stay
So I keep you with my laughter
Feel sooo complete

Something bout your brown eyes that gets me lost for days
Your touch is like an angel lookin out with heavens grace
And that's why I'll keep you shelter from the storm
I-I-I
I need you here with me

Cause I'm in love (with your) story
Need I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin' (lalala) I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you

[Big Sean]
Now listen
First off if it was the last thing
I'll put you first
So you deserve my last name
You make my worst days feel like my birthday
If we never happen we'll regret it in the worst way
Like not seeing the world trade your worth the galaxy baby so let's world trade
And I tend to tell God thank you
Cause baby your my angel
At least from my angle

[Keely]
Cause I'm in love (with your) story
Need I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin' (lalala) I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you
