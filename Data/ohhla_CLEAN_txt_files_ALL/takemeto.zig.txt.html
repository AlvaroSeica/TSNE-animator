Song:   Take Me to Jamaica
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Now the sun is in my eyes
And you know I'm feeling fine, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Where the reggae rhythms beat
Can't help but move my feet, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Where we can live in the country
Eat fruits from the tree, everything's irie
The coconut water is sweet

Where the three little birds they sing
Blue Mountains are happy again, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Feel the Caribbean breeze
Stress is calling but I can't be reached, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Where we can meet with good people
Dance all the day, singing don't worry
One love, one heart, one aim, aim, aim

Hummingbirds humming by
(Ooh, ooh)
See the pretty yellow butterfly, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

In the night hear the crickets sing
Fireflies are jamming, so take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Where we can live in the country
Eat fruits from the tree, everything's irie
The coconut water is sweet, yeah

Now the sun is in my eyes
And you know I'm feeling fine, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Where the reggae rhythms beat
I can't help but move my feet, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now
Take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now

Take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now</pre>
