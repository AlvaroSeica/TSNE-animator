[Dazastah] {Optamus, Shahbaz}
Think they're ready for the encore, you want more? {What for?}
Bringing back the essence of nascence of the brain's corridors
Echoing through your head {Bouncing through the rubble}
Like mother nagging ya, to clean up this mess
Cause trouble lurks, but I'm not here to teach ya
Responsibility, imagine me, as drunk talking silly gibberish
Send ya girl into a trifle, jiggle and wiggle and desert without innocence
{Cause it's hard for a dirty mind to bust nice rhymes}
And the beat's nitty gritty, bouncing like some double D titties
{The Perth city urban masters}
That's when you're asking for more like portal
And I've used it, abusing the mic
Like drunk teenagers when pigs try and break up their night
You won't find another crew that can do the Downsyde
Energy, shaking the floor with encore

[Hook X2 - Dazastah, Shahbaz] {Optamus}
Did you want more, what for? We drop this raw
{We be doing it on stage till the curtain call}
Did you want more, what for? We drop this raw
"I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way"
