[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Before I turn off your lights
I hope this shit's understood
If that ass wants to stay alive
You best not fuck with my hood
Poince trucha

[Knightowl]
Fools wanna be like me
MC's they best get out my path
They all leave in a blood bath
In this game I do control like
Check this out
This fool that said he was my homie
This mothafucka tried he always lied
And now he's livin lonely
Ain't nobody got's his back
That fool be wack on top of things
He smokin crack
He's fucked up in the mind with no rewind
Drugs done turn bad alot of good soldiers
You see I told ya
Don't fuck with shit
If you can hang
Like fuckin with my
Will get you blasted
Inside of a casket
It's be along mothafuckin time
Since I was young
I ain't got my ass kick
Times change like a fuckin diaper
The Knightowl became a snipper
All that shit you young knuckle heads
Be doin
I already earn that stripe on
So what is it
Does death wanna pay me a visit
Goes if so
I must not ever let go
Of them demons
All bitches gotta keep screamin
Cause I be the one that got's em
Jumpin to the rythem
That I give me
Pure gangsta shit mothafucka
When ever I hit em

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
The Knightowl be the sickest
Mothafucka don't you battle
Cause I'm coming
With the shank inside my pocket
You can't stop it
Hit em up just like graffiti
Smokin weed that's never seedy
Ain't no holding back around my city
The fuck with the peace treaty
What the fuck you talkin about fool
You want static automatic
To the mothafucka dome
I'll seperate you from your homes
Cause all of you levas should of never
Double cross the fuckin lokest
Now that ass is fuckin diein
That family tree's not multiplin
All the placas full of caca
La (?) no me saca
Saven que soy el que mata
Si es que sale alguna rata
Ponganse trucha
Descalabro
La cachucha cuando yo entro a la battalla
Yo y el diablo valasiamos los canallas
Traigo mis perros
Que no ladran
Descalabran a qual quiera que se ponga en frente
Que chinge su madre toda la gente
Si no quieren escucharme
Chingadasos quieren darme
Pues vamos a ver lo que pasa yo estoy listo pa enfrentarme

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
What the fuck you talkin about
Mcs like you can suck a dick
You best not trip
Or Ima take that ass back
To the days of the fuckin whip
About to begin unloadin
Sinical thoughts be explodin
With bad intentions full of crime
The six one nine is all fuckin mine
Even though I gets no radio love
You still cant top them barcode hits
The Knightowl be the one they all try to copy
Cause I'm poppy
I'm still the doppest rhyming
All them charts I keep on climing
To the top but I wont drop
Cream of the crop
And yous a lop
I be the baddest
Since shit began
Yo controlo San Diego
Esto es sierto
Me divierto
Cuando los entierro en el desierto
Vatos lloran por su madre
Depronto piden un padre
Desde que you era morro
Mi jefe me dijo "no ay que dejarse"
De ninguno- que te vuske
Por eso siempre cargo
Mi quete listo pa matar a qual quien
Cabron que no respete
El Tecolote be the mas chingon
Quemones pa los mamones
No ay versos mas chingones
Veinte tres veinte matones

[Chorus]</pre>
