Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I walk in this bitch lookin just like a bag of money
I be speakin and girlies be screaming they fiendin for me
but really it just be my money

Pull up, I be dressin, y'all be stressing
cause you know that I'm the bomb Armageddon, watch me call

See I don't want your bitch boy she got mad lips
she choke more than the cinnamon challenge
and ooh you never see me round it
and oh too much money in the counter

They like ooh you know your stuff, baby that what's up
got a girl in Virginia that look better than all your spouses
They like ooh you know your stuff, baby that what's up
got a girl in Virginia that look better than all your spouses

Down on your luck, down on your luck, down on your luck, down
Down on your luck, down on your luck, down

I'm up in this bitch I got money to burn so she stackin her tits
and I look in her face, and I put it away
I ain't throwing this money round, she think she so bad
she don't know I had plenty bitches bad
some of them quarters but know that I keep a few dimes around

Girl, keep popping, keep popping
don't stop till the money ain't dropping
body bad but don't face trance
I'm fucked up and I got cash, your luck pants
say you need that, I'm a real nigga I fiend that Japan

Down on your luck, down on your luck, down on your luck, down
Down on your luck, down on your luck, down</pre>
