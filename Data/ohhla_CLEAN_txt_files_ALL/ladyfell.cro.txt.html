[Intro: Crooked I]
Fuck man
Damn man I was fuckin a lot of bitches on Death Row
But goddamn man, I'm fuckin WAY more bitches on this Shady shit
Man this shit ain't even cool man like
Like these bitches fallin in love, man I need to come clean
Not even bitches man, like women man
I need to come clean with this shit bro
Damn Dominick

[Crooked I]
Dear women in my life
Past, present and future I'm givin you the right
to judge me now, bringin my sinnin to the light
Even the women I might be swimmin in tonight
Even the women that wanna kill me with a knife
cause they heard about other women, I'm givin them the pipe
I'm knowin the way that a nigga livin isn't right
But my angels and demons they keep gettin in a FIGHT
Half of me wants to be happily married
with a family, just like plenty of dudes
But the other half wanna keep fuckin 
these bad ass bitches out here who keep sendin me nudes
I know a lot of men been in my shoes
Crooked so confused, when he winnin he lose
He winnin in the "fuck a bad bitch" category
but he losin with the shallow ass women he choose
I mean God almighty, look at the body
on little mami, fo' sho', you a hotty
Knew where I would stand so she waited in the lobby
She a predator, I'm her prey and she shot me
Now we in the room man, workin the sheets
We goin half on some twins, that's a person apiece
She kept comin on strong but my woman back home gon' be hurtin for weeks
'bout the dirt in the streets
Cause

Chorus: Crooked I]
This, temp-ta-tion, is a real, si-tua-tion
And my chick, been, pa-tient, with all of my fornication
Hop in your panties I'm riskin it all, cheatin so how can my family evolve?
Real good girl in a fucked up world, a lady fell in love with a goddamn dog
Once upon a time in the LBC, a lady fell in love with a goddamn dog
Once upon a time in the LBC, a lady fell in love with a goddamn me
Hop in your panties I'm riskin it all, cheatin so how can my family evolve?
Real good girl in a fucked up world, a lady fell in love with a goddamn dog

[Crooked I]
... You there?
... You ask if I care?
... The answer is yeah
... You ask me to swear
... I know it ain't fair
... I know I'm a player
... You where?
... Why are you there?
How can I be mad if she flipped the script
tired of lies and decide to hop dick-to-dick?
Cryin her eyes out in my house, decide to find out
how I feel if another nigga lick the uhh
Some niggaz won't admit it but I'm tellin you 
that we don't give a fuck if we've been cheatin
We don't want you gettin even, we don't even want you leavin 
even though we been creepin and meetin people in the motherfuckin hotel
We be like "Oh well," wax that hoe tail
Then I make a song about it
I give the bitch some bars like no bail, Peace Prize Nobel
Feelin fucked up when it's all over the real shit begin
A guilt trip again, and she sick of goin through thick and thin
Cause

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
Can anybody feel me? Can anybody feel me?
I'm talkin 'bout the real me, and the real me is guilty
of puttin many women in the eye of the storm, is it truth serum Crooked I is on?
Every song ain't gon' have a happy endin, a old lady said I would die alone
If I don't change all of my ways, I'ma live all of my days
in a daze under the haze of a cloud full of darkness
Can't swallow the pain and the pain's all in my brain
and I can't follow the maze, man I'm lost, I ain't heartless
I looked in the crystal ball, and the only thing I saw
was me standin all alone, me standin on my own
I looked in the crystal ball, and the only thing I saw
was me standin all alone, how did I end up all alone? (all alone)

How did I end up all alone? (How did I end up all alone?)
How did I end up all alone? (How did I end up all alone?)
All alone (all alone, all alone)
Cause I'm a goddamn dog~!

[Chorus]
