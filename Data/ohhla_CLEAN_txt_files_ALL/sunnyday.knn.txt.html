Pour me a cup of tea like that old song
That I had, like that old girl I was wrong
And it's sad, if I spit I would cuss you
It's that bad, cuz I really did trust you
If the thought ever surfaced to leave you
I would die cuz the purpose would be you
You changed for the world look how you are
You front, grillin me from a dude's car?
How sudden, lemme see, you got a tongue ring?
How funny, we forget about the little things
Say word, now you hang out with big girls
And the guys you date these days diff-er
I hear the stories and it makes me sick-er
My heart aches you fake like a pict-ure
So close to reality but not quite
So dope man her body was so right
She was a high school chick, how would I know?
That our thoughts would conflict like the Bible?
I don't offend, I pretend like I'm laughing
Like we connect, like some shit could really happen
And it did, we made a move for this love thing
I met the parents and gave her the round ring
And all a sudden she got a license to nag me?
What the fuck I'm just try'na make you happy!

Sunny Days
Nope don't have em no more
What you on the phone for?
Don't call me no more
Sunny Days
Na see don't agonize me
I can't stand the stress
See I'm alright without you
Sunny Days
See I'm far from your reach now
Your body doesn't tempt me
Well maybe just a little
Sunny Days
Yeah on the real like welfare checks
You and I are through (through)

Alright I'm vexed
Alright look I'm tired and stressed
Don't come at me like that
Cool it, I'll be back
Watch Dr. Phil or something
Get yourself straight
You a little too excited
This ain't your birthday
You might as well be a rapper
Talkin all that shit
What theyou throwing things?
Alright that's it, you gon' fix it
I'm not gonna scream, not on some bitch shit
Na, but, chill, I'm not callin you a bitch
Just a figure of speech
What's all this "I hate you"s?
You sound like Kelis, love look
You're piercing me with these fierce screams
Seriously, my ears feel like they bleeding tears
And here's, the headscarf you left in my domain
And here's, the photos of our memory lane
And there's...(Nothing for you around here)
You crossed over to the other side of the tracks
So there's...(Nothing for you around here)
I used to bet on you, but now the bet's off
And you know I got +Roots+
Therefore my +Questlove+
A brother like me deserves the best of
And you're not, so um...

Sunny Days
Nope don't have em no more
Put you on the phone for?
Don't call me no more
Sunny Days
Na see don't agonize me
I can't stand the stress
See I'm alright without you
Sunny Days
See I'm far from your reach now
Your body doesn't tempt me
Well maybe just a little
Sunny Days
Yeah on the real like welfare checks
You and I are through (through)</pre>
