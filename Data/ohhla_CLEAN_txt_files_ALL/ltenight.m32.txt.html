[Mr. 3-2]
Now when the do's close, nobody knows
What really go down, with these sassy hoes
Take off they clothes, and go to work
Cut off my phone, so it don't chirp
Under the skirt, the monkey be soaking wet
She telling me take it easy, cause we just met
I'ma wreck, I commits to go hard
Banging it slanging it, I done barre
Cause after dark, when the clock hit twelve
Baby girl gon' moan, scream and yell
Hell, I might just go on hit that raw
But I'd be out of line, and against my law
Steady getting it wet, and gripping the ass
On her belly, so I won't shoot off fast
Don't even ask, but she got her mouth on me
Get in her head, alive by quarter to three

[Hook with Swab - 2x]
My late night rondevaux
And it ain't no telling, what she do
My late night rondevaux
And if she down with it, I am too

[Mr. 3-2]
She like nasty thangs, when the cock get hot
Up in it from the back, and I just can't stop
Throttling and thrust push and pump, up in it
While it gets sloppy, for 45 minutes
Stroking, so mama gon' open wide
Between them thighs, I'ma exercise
Flesh inside, while changing positions
Rod in the sea, and I'm deep sea fishing
Listen, how it make that gushy sound
As I smack it, flip it and rub it down
Feel it now, get it up if it's soft
But I doubt that seriously, I'm going off
Smash and toss, teach ya how to ride the mule
Put a hump in my back, when I'm doing the fool
On the cool, I'd probably make you number one
But never that, cause my homies gotta have some fun

[Hook - 2x]

[Mr. 3-2]
I know you don't love me, we playing a game
Cause we both got somebody at home, yeah mayn
So let me be me, and girl you be you
Hook up late nights, so I can plug you
Socket to socket, I'll knock it down
Take your feelings about me, cause I get's around
Don't be selfish, and don't you tell
Cause I cut's up sweet, like some caramels
Yellow's minard J, with the best of friends
Best of kin, I'm different than other men
I won't tell, keep it on the hush for real
That's the deal, tell me how the lumber feel
When I beat's it up, then send you home
We both grown, and you can't leave me alone
Face the fact, I got ya hot
Then open up for me, I'll change the cot

Uh-huh, this kinda beautiful to me baby
