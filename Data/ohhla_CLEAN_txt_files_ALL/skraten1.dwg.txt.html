[First Verse: White Dawg]
White Dawg, Blac Haze, watch us run game
Triple Gold D's and a fresh familiar paint
Twelve batteries with sixteen fuckin' switches
And watch us true players skraten' up on these bitches
Old English in the muthafuckin' backwood
High as Hell come blastin' through Hollywood
I want my money, so I'm regulatin' loccs
Sellin' game like a nigga used to sell coke
This how we ride, deep side plantation
Number one on every ghetto radio station
A-Trell's in the back bringin' much funk
Throw your hands up, nigga let's get it crunk
Independent, all about that cheddar mane
I want a million so I'm grindin' for this fuckin' change
Broward thugs and we don't give a fuck
That's why we tell these hoes Skraten' Up, Skraten' Up!!!

[Second Verse: Blac Haze]
I know you niggas see me, chumped out
You wanna touch me
Got your bitch on my dick now
She wanna fuck me
I never pulled a pistol on a nigga
unless I shot a triple beam in them dope spots
My nigga got 'em, y'all niggas wanna murder me?
Blac Haze muthafucka ever heard of me?
Talkin' shit behind my back, oh you was really spooked?
I roll with merciless G's, them niggas killas too, fuck that shit yo
Real muthafuckas don't hesitate
Bitch better have that money straight
Low on cheddar we got to break
Ain't got no job, we got to take
Fuck y'all niggas, get that bread
Cock that shit, roll that lead
Nigga want beef?  Two to the head
Call the police, that nigga dead
I roll with killas ain't no love
All these fucked niggas, wannabe thugs
Sippin' on Hennessey, hit that weed
Nigga talkin' shit, nigga wanna bleed
Got that blunt?  I'll hit that shit
Gotta get paid and hit that shit
Spit that fire, clack, clack, clack
Straighten up nigga, hit the back
