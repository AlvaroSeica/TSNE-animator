[Intro: Tyler Woods] (Styles P) 
(Yo!) Let me let me get faded, let, let, Tyler Woods!
Hold on my nigga let me get faded
(Like you gotta be high if you want sometimes, just to, you know)
Let, Let (Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!)

[Chorus: Tyler Woods] (Styles P)
Here we go! Same old shit (Uh!)
Same old niggas I don't even fuck with (Uh!)
Same old bitch say a nigga ain't shit
Same old pussy ass niggas in their clique yeah!
Here we go! Let, let, let me get faded
Turn the mic on while I get faded
Hold on my nigga let me get faded
Turn the lights down let me get faded
Here we go!

[Verse One: Styles P] (Tyler Woods)
Let me get faded!
Me and Benjamin Franklin is like we related
Me and Mary Jane we get so sedated
Long as you respect it you could love it or hate it
OWWWWW!!!! It's the same old shit
If the rap don't work then the 'caine 'gon flip
Just the juice bar nigga in the mango six
And my lingo kick, and I bang my shit (G-Go!)
Hold up! Hold up! Let me get faded
Roll up the A for the sour high graded
You can copy but you just can't paste it
You can smell the weed but you sure can't taste it

[Chorus: Tyler Woods] (Sheek Louch)
Here we go! Same old shit 
Same old niggas I don't even fuck with
Same old bitch say a nigga ain't shit
Same old pussy ass niggas in their clique yeah!
Here we go! Let, let, let me get faded
Turn the mic on while I get faded (WOO!)
Hold on my nigga let me get faded 
Turn the lights down let me get faded (Aiyyo)
Here we go!

[Verse Two: Sheek Louch] (*Tyler Woods)
I was young I was gettin my hair braided
Mama pullin on my scalp I'm like god damn I hate it (AHHHH!)
Now I'm sittin in the coupe I'm like god damn I made it
I ain't seen you in my life how we god damn related?! (HUH!)
That's why I get faded (WOO!) No matter if I spit the hottest shit
I'm underrated, no matter if I fuck the hottest bitch I'm still skatin (Ha Ha!)
We ain't drop in years but our fans is still waitin
Got a new man and a baby how the fuck you still hatin?! (*G-Go!)
We ain't even touchdown but our numbers is still Peyton
Everyday is our birthday on purple sets belated (Yeah!)
Everyday is our birthday on purple sets belated (What!)
We-We-We-We-We get faded (Yeah!)

[Chorus: Tyler Woods] (Sheek Louch) (*Jadakiss)
Here we go! Same old shit (WOO!)
Same old niggas I don't even fuck with
Same old bitch say a nigga ain't shit
Same old pussy ass niggas in their clique yeah!
Here we go! Let, let, let me get faded
Turn the mic on while I get faded 
Hold on my nigga let me get faded (Hold on! EH HEHHHHHH!!!!!) 
Turn the lights down let me get faded (Uh!)
Here we go!

[Verse Three: Jadakiss] (*Tyler Woods)
Let-Let-Let me get faded!
You are now rockin with Sean, Jason and David (L.O.X.)
We solid gold these niggas is gold plated
The only reason you still alive I've ok'd it
(Ha Ha!) Yep! Same old 'Kiss (Muah!)
Still in the hood on the same strip (Uh!)
Stickin to the story yeah the same old script
If your formula works then don't change yo' shit (*G-Go!)
Hold up! Hold up! Let me get faded! (Uh!)
Everything's for sale But I prefer to keep the haze lit 
Ain't about money might as well not even say shit
Get shot or get bladed, we get faded!

[Chorus: Tyler Woods]
Here we go! Same old shit 
Same old niggas I don't even fuck with
Same old bitch say a nigga ain't shit
Same old pussy ass niggas in their clique yeah!
Here we go! Let, let, let me get faded
Turn the mic on while I get faded 
Hold on my nigga let me get faded 
Turn the lights down let me get faded
Here we go!
