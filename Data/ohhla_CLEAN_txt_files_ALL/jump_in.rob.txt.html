Song:   Jump in the Ride
Typed by: ja_rule@lowrider.com

First of all I'd like to start it off by saying Q-Vo
From a little vato con respecto y orgullo
With much pride, jump in the ride
Hit side to side, down the calle we slide and glide
Hitting the switches, the paint job is sticking
I'ma pop your tape in the tape deck because it's hitting
You hear it from across town
No gente don't get scared and don't let no one get you down
Cuz if they do I'll be around gente
I'll turn your frowns upside down with my sounds gente
Been doing this since I was fifteen and lived through nineteen
Smoking up like Cheech and Chong having Nice Dreams
Simon

[Chorus]
Jump in the ride, pass that ass from side to side
As this crazy cholo takes you on another crazy cholo ride
I don't really give a shit about what you're saying bitch
Hey, what time is it

Yeah, it's time for jacking, my homeboys are-a packing
Your fucking carrucha got the fusca so keep trucha
Cuz if you got what we want
If it's firme as they say and it bumps in your trunk
Then hey man that shit is getting taken
I know it's something that your hating
But us vatos aren't faking
So give it up before it's too late
Cuz you'll get sprayed if you don't cooperate
And so you punks want to try me
That's what you get for trying to roll your bad ass up beside me
We do it clean, ain't nobody behind
You'll catch me on the rebound, I can't believe you think you'll find me
I do shit the smart way
You wanna start, pero man don't let my quette spray
Because this vato just don't give a fuck and shit man
It's time to let my fucking quette spit man

[Chorus]
Jump in the ride, pass that ass from side to side
As this crazy cholo takes you on another crazy cholo ride
I don't really give a shit about what you're saying bitch
What's your name? (Oh he's Hispanic man)

Ese Lil' Rob ready to take them to the street
Cuz I can take you to the street with a crazy beat
Oh man, putos wanna be slipping, wanna be tripping 
But they don't know that their blood is gonna be dripping
If they roll through my barrio man
Don't fuck around with the crazy fucking vato down for the town
Oh down for the town for the crown that he commits
But I'm too sly, too slick so I split
Get away clean, leaving the scene
People think I live to die 
And I'm only twenty, with the bullet
Not afraid to pull it, so don't make me do it
Down for my shit, don't make me prove it
Cuz saves que, ese you can't last
Once I start to blast cuz I pull the trigger faster
Here's a disaster, watch your hyna cry as I blast ya

Twenty with the bullet
Twenty with the bullet

[Chorus]
Jump in the ride, pass that ass from side to side
As this crazy cholo takes you on another crazy cholo ride
I don't really give a shit about what you're saying bitch
As we go a little something like this

Lil' Rob, Lil' Rob, Lil' Rob
Cuz I'm back on the fucking block and I

[Chorus]
Jump in the ride, pass that ass from side to side
As this crazy cholo takes you on another crazy cholo ride
I don't really give a shit about what you're saying bitch
As we go a little something like this

Lil' Rob back in the house
