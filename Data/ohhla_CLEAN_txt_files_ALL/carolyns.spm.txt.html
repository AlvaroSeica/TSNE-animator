[SPM]
Yeah, I ain't got no hook for this jam
Here we go, here we go
I'm just gonna let ya, feel the music on the hooks
Knahmsayin'

[Verse 1]
In the rancho everybody knows Carlos
Still writing, still fumando arbos
I'm locked up with my gente, no hay salida
Trying to finish up this book about my vida
On appeal and it's gonna take a full year
They asking me, if I wanna go to school here
At a time when a person really needs a friend
I'm thinking bout getting back on them streets again
I gave the Benz to Happ and the Vet to Beesh
I hope they use 'em to ride on my enemies
I got two left, whaz up young Hugh Heff?
I heard my brother just signed up a new cheff
Lucky Lu the Screwston freestyla
Ya just wishing that the Dope House would die, huh?
I heard ya boys talking down, bumpin lips
But big mouths is only good for sucking dicks
When I was free none of ya step to me
Now that I'm locked, you hoes is disrespecting me
I'll be back before you bitch niggaz count to ten
But I can touch you, way before I'm out the pen
No names, I don't play that silly game
You smoking too much weed, you ain't no killa maine
I bring vengeance, can't put it all in one sentence
But if there is a hell, I can show you to the entrance
Muthafucka, oh yeah
And this shit don't stop
I told you they can't stop it
Here we go, two verses

[Verse 2]
Every bodies day comes, I fuckin ate crumbs
I'm not a star but now I date some
Those who new me, as a child growing up
See me Benz turn around and start throwing up
What cha think? that I'm happy cause a new car
Ya come to me sayin' I don't care who you are
I knew you when you wasn't nothing and still ain't
You just Carlos Coy but on a lil tape
You think u bad with your big house and fancy ride?
But a man is only good for what he has inside
So I say. Then why are you so mad?
Have you ever heard of me to go brag?
On this earth I'm no betta than any body
I was more happier without any money
I haven't changed not one little bitty bite
To be honest ya the ones who really did
Hatin me, cause you live in misery
But theres other ways of takin kicks and dissin me
No revenge, I just want my family and friends
Fuck the Benz and you can have the millions
All I want is a worm and a finishing pole
Behind bars is the little things you miss the most
All the parties, the clubs they don't mean nothing
I miss telling little kids the can be something
Give 'em hope cause I know they up against the odds
Tell 'em do they best, leave the rest to God
Ma'an I know they make you feel like you don't belong
Can't see your own kind only shows this song
Lil homie that's only cause they scared of us
Don't play me, they say cause I bare too much
I'm not negative but trying to be a pessimist
But your fear got you hatin on the Mexicans

[Carolyn Rodriguez]
Fuck this jealous hoes, Playa hatin hoes
They fuckin with my Los, Oooo
I gave you my whole life, my body and my mind
My love and my time, you know I'll rise
Oh it's Dope House that's for life
I told you bitches once
And now ill I tell you twice
It's dope house for life, the home of the brave
This haters cannot play, you can try it your own way
And see your day
For all my G's on lock, for those who rep they block
For those whose in the box
You know, we don't stop</pre>
