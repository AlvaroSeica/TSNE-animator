Song:   Everyday I Do It
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I say everyday I do it, everyday I do it, everyday I do it

Yeah, fucking bitches getting money yeah, everyday I do it
In the kitchen whipping chickens yeah everyday I do it
On the mission for the riches yeah everyday I do it
And I'm riding with the cannon, and won't hesitate to use it
Everyday I do it, everyday I do it, everyday I do it
And I'm riding with the cannon, and won't hesitate to use it
Make that chopper sing to you, boy we call it murder music

I had a million dollar dream, woke up with money on my mind
I know bloods and crips but I throw up with dollar signs
And my phone ringing, what you need homie
Yeah I rap, but I still can get them thangs nigga
I'm talking white girl or the green nigga
You need pills homie, we call em beans nigga
I'm on a money making mission, they can't take my position
Put that barrel to his head, tell that motherfucker listen
Can you hear me nigga, it's my block now
Send them young boys through to shut the block down
Let 'em out and come back and off the shop now
Now them newer bad boys on the watch now

Yeah, fucking bitches getting money yeah, everyday I do it
In the kitchen whipping chickens yeah everyday I do it
On the mission for the riches yeah everyday I do it
And I'm riding with the cannon, won't hesitate to use it
Everyday I do it, everyday I do it, everyday I do it
And I'm riding with the cannon, won't hesitate to use it
Make that chopper sing to you, boy we call it murder music

Everyday I do it, got my work stashed in Buick
Federalies on my tail, so I shake 'em and I lose 'em
Got your bitch in the passenger seat, I make her take it off
Routine traffic stop, they searched the car she take the charge
I know how to play my cards, you fucking with a dealer
I send Peter through, he giving head shots like it's tequila
In the white body Benz, the same, hogging the lanes up
The purple got me moving off, speed like a change up
Now I'm at a dice game, 7 and 11's
Head crack after head crack, I'm taking the cedar
I'm a natural born hustler, milking on my customers
Clientele, gotta watch my back cause even clients tell
Have you standing in the court then sit you in a tiny cell
New Orleans saints nigga, that's where all the giants dwell
Fire from the rifle make you feel like you right in hell
Might as well keep your mouth shut or you gonn bite the shell

Yeah, fucking bitches getting money yeah, everyday I do it
In the kitchen whipping chickens yeah everyday I do it
On the mission for the riches yeah everyday I do it
And I'm riding with the cannon, won't hesitate to use it
Everyday I do it, everyday I do it, everyday I do it
And I'm riding with the cannon, won't hesitate to use it
Make that chopper sing to you, boy we call it murder music</pre>
