[Chorus: Obie Trice]
You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy
You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy
Hate if you wanna, that don't faze me
I ain't go-in no-o-where right now

[Obie Trice]
It's the fo' pound bandit, the cokehead that handed
Detroit branded - God damnit, O. Trice back
And OHH, they so adamant, I'm still at it
You should see the grill on a faggot if only looks could kill
But O is so accurate over this Mathers sack{?}
and it's never inadequate, I swear these haters need to chill
It's SO, automatic that he is above average
Jesus of Nazareth reached his soul and so
he is a talent that has managed to mechanically use a pen 
and the pad and the alphabet to get ahead
Niggaz mad cause he's single-handedly gettin this bread
Bitches is in his bed, bullet's still in his head
I'm back~! Fully loaded I'm ready to let off lead
Metal is heavy and I'm ready to let it all rip
The return of that vigilante on that Big +Party and Bullshit+
Ya dig? The kid's back you biatch

[Chorus]

[Obie Trice]
I don't suffer to whispers 
of these envious niggaz mad cause his nuts not in my denim
Wanna be him so much they send slugs to kill him
Then keep it on the hush, not to become a victim
Vicious, niggaz I rid them, I spit
Piss on his existence on that bullshit
I pull up muzzle yell, send the Beelzebub back to hell
I'm a thug, I'ma clap him 'til he fell
Then he fall, I'ma ball, I'm a beast, I'm the streets
I'm the reason you abroad, I'm a boss, I'm me
Obie 'bout that change, get rich fast
The Claude Van Damme of the game, kick ass
Tap into a nigga I done came then bounce back like whiplashes
And dump my cigar ashes on your asses
It's still Trice and Mathers, all that matters
All that other madness, past us, this is magic

[Chorus]

[Obie Trice]
My feet up, I re'd up
Read up, on the MC who's a D to over-achiever
My Visa, feeds him in that villa
Overseas in that V-1-dub with mamacita
I'm G'd up, Jesus, my cheese keep reachin up
Planted the seed and then it beamed up
It beanstalk, being tall
Now I'm ballin on these muh'fuckin peanuts
Uhh - the demons, wanna deliver me
Wanna deem him as the enemy but O too slippery
I'm back on you faggots, nigga ain't no sympathy
I don't fuck wit'chu actors, I do mine differently
Trice made history, now all these fake niggaz wanna mention me
Couldn't wait 'til I break in this with my entity
It don't even interest me, I'ma keep my energy spittin
Obie is in this to win this and that's the endin
