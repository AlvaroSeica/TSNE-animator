As I rush to complete this jigsaw
why we let the government control the way we live
ya'll  I see I don't need a thing far from one chick and a decent car
And I've studied nothing but leaps and falls
Miracles are seeming like a distant star...

Can I get agreement from a witness
all gone miss this deficit we creeping on
No one has to ask if they are even involved
this affects you only if you breath at all
If you are a mister or a misses
dog or mistress  everyone will reap what's sown
it don't matter none if you ain't meant it wrong
or meant to negatively treat one's soul
Ya'll gone see! Buried in a vault
is evidence linking the government to all  Martin Luther King
the Kennedy's to Ros  Well
I'm not afraid to say the list is long
Living under twisted law from senior citizens
citizens wish would croak
Suffer some disease never speaked it loud
so we just deal with what each get thrown so we won't fall...

Down
Naw
'cause that ain't what I'm talking 'bout
Naw
Down the way is what I'm talking 'bout now  Nope
cause they ain't really on it
Ya'll steadily be talking 'bout 'the days' and we on them
Get Down! Naw
'cause that ain't what I'm talking 'bout
Naw
Down the way is what I'm talking 'bout now  Nope
cause they ain't really on it
Ya'll steadily be talking 'bout 'the days' and we on them.

I'ma have to slow it up so ya'll can catch up anyway  Shawty
Prince is more than what your mom and daddy finna play
Terror isn't evident
it's happening and everybody rich has got a place
up on a shuttle when the Earth break down
Down like a waffle iron, brown
Sounds like a scream out of Godzilla's mouth say ahh
Watch a missile fly and make the world say ahh
Thinking Judgment Day and make it hurt my mind
Sour as some salt up in my lemonade
Everybody's sweet as Willy Wonka on a busy day
And  They be steady popping bout some pistol play
Dough like Betty Crocker but a heart as soft as kiddie weights  Wait
I don't really mean it that way so
I'ma keep it rocking while you leaning that way  No sugar coating
me get diabetes that way  Yo
mama if you're opposite the meaning I'm laying...

Down
Naw
'cause that ain't what I'm talking 'bout
Naw
Down the way is what I'm talking 'bout now  Nope
cause they ain't really on it 
Ya'll steadily be talking 'bout 'the days' and we on them
Get Down! Naw
'cause that ain't what I'm talking 'bout
Naw
Down the way is what I'm talking 'bout now  Nope
cause they ain't really on it 
Ya'll steadily be talking 'bout 'the days' and we on them.

Beasts get marked in the up and coming timeframe
Innovating numbers to your motherloving mind frame
Mind games in the conscious
watch this rhyme turn a frozen elevator to a coffin  Coughing
elevated caution often turns me to a maniac
I offer alter routes  To get boot
you won't listen  Nukes shoot and give clues they ain't missing
Tripping like a needle-shooting midget who's crippling from
Economics twisting the condition he's crippling from
Don't know where to end or where to come just
Hope I got some people in the bleachers with the pom poms  Now comes
action you can't pay to see or run from  Dum dum dum
with a finale at the long run  Now
for one more decade
shawty
let's get down  Before some nutcase knocks our rest place...

[Chorus]</pre>
