[Intro: Afro Samurai Sample - Afro (Okiku)]
Thanks for everything (you're leaving?)
Tomorrow... (please, keep it for you travels)
(Will you not stay for me, for just one more day
If it's not too much to ask, will you stay and watch the fireworks with me?)

[Allen Anthony]
You move me...
I stared at your lips everytime you spoke, then speak
Ohhhh.... so lovely...
When you kiss my lips, it drives me crazy
Ohhhh.... so precious...
Everytime you wrap your arms around me
Ohhhh.... and I thank you... oooh
I couldn't see, but now I see, you're the only one that I need

[Chorus: Allen Anthony]
Let's take long walks in the park, by ourselves
Let's make love forever...
Ooooh... let's reveal the magic we feel in each other
All of these things that we feel will come true...

[Allen Anthony]
Now baby...
When we do it, you make me scream your name
Ohhh... hey, you make me want it so bring it on myself...
To you, oh...
I can be your better man (I can be your better man, if you just bring
on your head)
Have a special thing, you and me...
Because you're the only one...
Who will ask anything

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
