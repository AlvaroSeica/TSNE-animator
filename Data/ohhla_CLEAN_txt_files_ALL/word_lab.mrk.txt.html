Song:   From the Word Lab
Typed by: Andrew_Lindley@hotmail.com

While you party your ass off we work our ass off
To give you something to party to, take your hats off
To beats that Mark created
We're happy that you made it
To witness a performance that you'll never forget
From the United Kingdom, to auditoriums
All around the world
People are spreading the word
Tell 'em we're coming, emcee veteran gunning
For profit and gain, my mission to entertain
Crowds that fell asleep waiting for something deep
The wait is over and finally we're here
Arriving in chauffer driven hired vans at jams with hired hands
A backing vocalist, a dj as the band
I told you I'd be back with venom
Sending 'em to hell and back
Any doubts you had we're ending 'em
With the swing of a pendulum, defender defending 'em
Rules we're bending 'em, mixing and blending 'em
And all in due time everything will be obvious
The story is plain as your nose, We'll be victorious
Anticipate the return, listen and learn
Wait your turn, this is for all concerned

[Chorus]

While you party your ass off, we work our ass off
To give you something to party to, take your hats off
To beats that we created, we're happy that you made it
To witness a performance that you'll never forget
From the word lab to the streets of Japan
To the streets of France, to the streets of Amsterdam
We gain critical acclaim, critics are tamed
Aware of our names, we returned to re-ignite the flames
Recordings are delivered on schedule
The album is completed and original
Now all that remains are the dates to be confirmed
The press to be informed because it's critical
Ads in magazines that could spark off our dreams
We're keen to be heard by any and all fiends
For rap beats taken from back streets
And brought to the forefront to stand face to face with the elite
The heat uncontrollable, too hot to handle
The record a demonstration of skills that cause scandals
The media tracking us every step of the way
There's a time to be serious, a time to play

[Chorus]

This is for the listeners, lend me an ear
The exhibition is on
Beats are fresh, vocals are clear
Lights low, deliver my flow nice and steady with impact
The deeper the better the contact
In fact, the organization is intact
It's hard getting the breaks but cool since I been back
Now that I see that you're ready, it's time to unleash
The beast deadly with a mic but still friendly
We been around for a while undercover with live
Performances a rarity, time for change
Rearrange the plans, throw 'em off the scent
Stand firm till the end, make way for the men
Here we come again, able and diligent
With styles magnificent, our rise is imminent
Soldiers in a game with aims in a higher plane
Remain unchanged by the hands of fame

[Chorus]

Yeah
From the word lab, to the streets of Japan
From the word lab, to the streets of Milan
From the word lab, to the streets of Iran
From the word lab
To the streets of your land</pre>
