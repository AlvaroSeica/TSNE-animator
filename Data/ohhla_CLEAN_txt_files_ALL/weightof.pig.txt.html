"Sometimes I feel the weight of the world
And its so heavy and its bringing me down"

[Verse One]
Wake up wake up
Wake up to another day
Gotta get to work gotta get the big pay
I got car notes and rent and the other nonsense
That's slowly turning me into a slave
But its Okay 
Because I look good
I got the best clothes and the best neighborhood
And that's what it's about the American dream
We in a rat race but the rats want cream
In an obscene amount more than I can count
So I won't recognize that I'm drowning deep
In the oceans of life my breathe full of strife
And my head aches the stress just pounding me down
Hear comes the tears of a clown
The hottest name in the whole town this time
But the frown that's inside is hidden by my pride
Cause everything I want is mine

[Chorus] [x2]
"But sometimes I feel the weight of the world"
Weight of the world
"And its so heavy and its bringing me down"
Bringin' me down

But I gotta get up
I gotta get up

[Verse Two]
Wake up to another day
Gotta peek out just make sure it safe
Cause these times are changing and reshaping
Into something I can't face and it feels strange
We got religious people judging the whole world
We got pimps and hoes once boys and girls
We got the media telling us whose to blame
But whose the media who's really running the game?
Gotta get up gotta shake it off
Cause life is long as an unsung song in the dark
I'm getting confused I'm getting upset
Things don't work out I'm hunting a check
Regret is creeping up my window
My life is reachin' a crescendo
I gotta numb it with drank and indo
Not chasing a dream I'm wasting time
Cause everything I want is mine

[Chorus] [x2]
"But sometimes I feel the weight of the world"
Weight of the world
"And its so heavy and its bringing me down"
Bringin' me down

But I gotta get up
I gotta get up

[Bridge]
I'm having a great day 
Everything is okay
I'm doing fine just don't look in my eyes 
I'm having a great day 
Everything is okay
I'm doing fine just don't look in my eyes 
Oh no

I gotta get up I gotta get up [x8]

"Sometimes I feel the weight of the world
And its so heavy and its bringing me down"
All around the world!

[Chorus] [x2]
"But sometimes I feel the weight of the world"
Weight of the world
"And its so heavy and its bringing me down"
Bringin' me down

It's gettin' to me
This stuff is gettin' to me
Weight of the world
It's kinda gettin' to me</pre>
