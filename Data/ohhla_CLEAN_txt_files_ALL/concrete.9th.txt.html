[Intro: 9th Prince]
Fucking hot, man, yo

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, I spit a verse that'll put ya'll niggas in a hearse
Straight out the soil of the Shaolin dirt
Tommy Hillfiger slippers, fine wine sippers
N.Y.C. killas, Slick Rick is slick, but 9th Prince is slicker
All this talk about Drake and Nicki Minaj
They got 'Young Money', but Wu-Tang still living large
RZA parked the Maserati inside the garage
We ain't home, we at the Mirage, partying hard
Shoot at the devil for wearing Prada, verbal globetrotter
Microphone doctor, never wore silk but I'm still the shocker
Sit back and laugh with my own staff
On corny rappers trying to live out they past
You ask and your raps is trash
I'm rough like Bronze Nazareth beats, and smooth like jazz

[Chorus: sample]
Concrete jungle...
Concrete jungle...

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, I'm starting to get restless, I aim the best to test it
See me hanging out with Bill Murray and the GZA in Texas
My catalog manifest through the analog
Sit down and relax and have a conversation with God, Pelle Pelle leather
I'm heavyweight, ya'll niggas is lightweight, lighter than a feather
Whatever, Killarm' let's get together
Return of the Six Men Wetting, in your area
Live from a hundred and fifty-fifth
Shoot the gift, that's swift, when I uplift the four-fifth
Welcome the party crashers, cut you in your face, slash ya
Make your body disappear, abracadabra
Your stranded in another hemisphere, I'm dressed in military gear
Sincere verbal warfare, put me on the top of your list
With Rakim and Nas, Kool G. Rap, Slick Rick and a few other guys
But that's it, I split niggas wigs and shit
I wild out like Jesus with a hoodie, sipping on wine
Talk like a bully when I rhyme
Arts and crafts, money flows and hoes and bubble baths

[Chorus]

[Outro: 9th Prince]
Ya'll niggas know what time it is out there
9th Prince and my man Division
We up in here, escaping the wordly prison
You know, 9th Prince slapping ya'll bitch ass niggas
Check it out, yeah yeah I'm out of here, out of here
Killa Sin, come home, son
Killarmy, what up, niggas?
Wu-Tang</pre>
