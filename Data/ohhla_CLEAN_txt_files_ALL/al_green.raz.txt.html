[Hell Razah]
I was taught when you hustle stack money for bail
And you can tell who's a flop by their first week's sales
So I move on the streets what you do in a week
Underneath all that makeup all these niggas is sweet
I'm the next Carmelo out in New York ghetto
And I don't mean I'm only hot in five boroughs
Too many artists out there now that's not thorough
Where it if the shoes fits
I produce hits of poetry for acoustics
It's like the game is a pool stick
The white ball got us blackballed
With eight balls in the corner pockets
Under the tables of the labels</pre>
