[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
If a nigga try to get at you
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
If a bitch try to set you up
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
If a nigga hustle on your block
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
Ten g's on my arms, and I got a nice charm
And I rock the most ice, cuz I got it going on

[Rubbabandz]
I ain't a nice dude, in fact I'm real mean
Million dollar flow, dollar and a fucking dream
Eligeble bachelor, million dollar flow
Jack you for your phantom, throw you off your fucking boat
New Jack City, Vol. 1, oh no
Nino Brown, G-Money shit, cutthroat
Dick in the butt-ass, gay niggas get the dildo
Watch how I knock 'em out, stomp 'em with the heel toe
Why he had to fuck with me, now he bleeding
All over the floor, picking up his teeth
I don't know why I like beef, I keeps me a piece
And I don't give a fuck about police
I don't give a fuck who you gon' get, I ain't never bent
Don't get ya homey smoked like a cigarette
These rappers is just acting, quiet on the set
Lights camera, action, they ain't no threat

[Chorus] </pre>
