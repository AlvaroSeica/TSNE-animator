Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Where the 40's at?
And the MICKEY'S

How Y'all feel out there?
WASTED!
That's what they say
Suburban - ....to the K
Useless - Hopeless Crew
Watch them all pollute the youth
Senseless - It makes no sense
Guilty - Their last defense
Changing - was evidence
Call them wasted youth
Wasted!. . Wasted!

If you like to drunk and you dont give a fuck say "Hell
Yeah"
HELL YEAH!
All the ladiess in the crowd who like dick in they mouth

Say "Oww"
OWW!

Now if I aint at the bar then I musta bounced cuz JR I

Like my liquor in large amounts
Just like I like my woman in large amounts
Wit real tight asses if they know how to bounce
Now gettin wasted with me is like startin a war with

Rambo, if I had tv show it'd be on the drunk channel
You can't handle my ammo or handle a jack daniels
Mr. Richter AKA the Party Animal

Now its time to get drunk dawg and smoke some crip
Y'all mothafuckaz dont want no parts of this
Roll another blunt. we gettin fucked up tonight
I dont think you really wanna see me on this mic
Shut the fuck up! just like simon says
Double dash in that ass
Put that pussy to bed
Wake it back up and put it back to sleep
Give it a kiss on the cheek and wish it sweet dreams

Wasted. Drunk. Ya know. God Damn

How Y'all feel out there?
WASTED!
That's what they say
Suburban - ....to the K
Useless - Hopeless Crew
Watch them all pollute the youth
Senseless - It makes no sense
Guilty - Their last defense
Changing - was evidence
Call them wasted youth
WASTED!. . WASTED!

If you like to get wasted and ya feelin faded say "Hell
Yeah"
HELL YEAH!
And all the ladies on the set if your pussy real wet say

"Oww"
OWW!

You know the D double dash always getting towed back
You can catch me in the club with a fine ass bitch
Nice rack. big tits. y'all know the deal. my sidekick

Shoulder blade lemme brush my shouldaz off a lil bit and

Fill up my drink with some captain n coke. no charge

Becase its free
Im a pimp mothafucker dont trip I'll pimp your shit. the

Name's D-Loc, bitch! just remember it motherfucka

Well damn right its a party tonight
Yo whos got the joint cuz I gots the light
Whos got the keg cuz I got the tapper
All we need is a DJ and some strippers, fast!
Ride hard, Stay strong, Live stoned's my modo
What you know bout finishing bottle after bottle
What you know bout puttin back 5th after 5th
I know I probably dont ?? but I just don't give a fuck!

I'll break it down like whatever you want
Wasted. hahaha I been there

WASTED!
That's what they say
Suburban - ....to the K
Useless - Hopeless Crew
Watch them all pollute the youth
Senseless - It makes no sense
Guilty - Their last defense
Changing - was evidence
Call them wasted youth
WASTED!. . WASTED!

Alright gettin wasted and gettin your high on.. its 2

Different things
When you get your high on your kinda like just trippin

In the head. ya know what I mean? you're high but your

Funky. ya know what I mean?
So when you get wasted, to me that's like gettin drunk

Ya know get you gettin a little sluggy?
When you get your high on in wondering way you just

Kinda wondering around
When you're wasted its like God Damn! I just wanna

Lay..i just wanna lay down ya know what I mean?
When you wasted yous like fuck that shit! I wanna lay down. wasted</pre>
