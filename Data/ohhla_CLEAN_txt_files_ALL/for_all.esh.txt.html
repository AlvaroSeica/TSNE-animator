Song:   4 All Tha Suicidalists
Typed by: WakMasterA@aol.com

Listen 'cause this is the sound of a crucifix
The U-N-H-O-L-Y's now in the looser mix
Unholy's inside a me so I get homocidous
The unholy poetry is for all the suicidalists
Just another brother from D-E-T-R-O-I-T
I pack a Smith and Wesson 'cause I don't know karate
I ain't no punk nigga, pull the trigger is my thang though
Grew myself an afro, never sported a kango
Niggaz I strangle, they don't wanna tangle
Fuck a priest 'cause I mash and I mangle
I'm takin' to the top, I'm makin' 'em drop
They thinkin' I'm not, I'm shakin'em, bakin' em, kickin' em, stickin' em
And always keep hittin' 'em
Until I get rid of 'em, I'm pickin' up the microphone
To kick the funky D-O-P-E is on the microphone
I had to make it funky once again for my opponent
I left the stage fulla blood stains 'cause I was on it
The U-N-H-O-L-Y, Esham you never knew I
Could kick it so wicked, inflict pain, do I?
The U-N-H-O-L-Y, hell I kick a lotta titles
But this is for all the suicidalists

"My father was a priest cold-blooded, he's dead"
"And hear the demons screamin' as his body bled"
"My father was a priest cold-blooded he's dead"
"Poured on the holy water, bless the dead is what I said"

Some say I'm the son of satan, but they're relatin'
Bodily harm, some waitin' for the storm
That I bring when I sing, it's a gathering of people
The U-N-H-O-L-Y so check out the evil
The evil not a stunk from the wicked poetry funk
Esham's the soul that I'm projectin' huh?
I'm like a deadly disease, 360 degrees
Of the U-N-H-O-L-Y so fall to your knees
Dead is all around the sounds'll pound down
And drive you insane until it busts your brain
I'ma head banger, a acid rap slanger
Comin' on stage puttin' up my middle finger
Sayin' fuck it and grabbin' my balls
All the MC's in the house got shit in their drawers
'Cause I'm the scarer, a one man terror
So never compare a sucka with me 'cause I run 'em like mascara
So no need to tell you my title 'cause you know what my title is
This is for all the suicidalists

"I looked into her eyes and she was scared as hell"
"A homocidal maniac with suicidal tendencies"
"Shoot me of the people I dismantle"
"So to stop her from jumpin' I just cut up the bitches"

Death is the penalty if you're ever caught bitin' me
Some say I'm insane but it's my split personality
The groove it's just wicked so it makes me shake
I thought this time I'd make a rhyme and see what it takes
You suckas tried to creep me then I'll have to get my gat
And bust you in the head for tryin' to steal my acid rap
Esham's here just for this verse
The U-N-H-O-L-Y rocks it much worse
Rock and roll, heavy metal hip hopster
Word after word till the break a dawn, brother
Rockin' ay, as I play
To the rhythm that I just kicked today
I'ma sway and keep on kickin' it for the ones who buy this
The needle's on the wax for all the suicidalists

"Oh, I'm a ho so I don't have to kill"
"I just educate minds to reality"
"Uh, oh shit damn that's another"
"So you weak ass hoes keep dreamin'"</pre>
