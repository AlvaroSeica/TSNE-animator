[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah,  yeah... that's what I'm talking about
Gangsta shit... yeah

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Chiefs and cowards, I represent that poison
Like the white smoke from the Twin Towers
Or when you wake up, in the middle of the night, and your body is shaking
Like the feds from the  insinuations, that these cowards is making
I represent that poison, nigga I ain't playing, fucker

[Solomon Childs]
This how it feels to be overpowered, I'll back out a zoo on your cowards
From bulldogs to hogs, you bout to be in the belly of war
Ain't no time for talk, a team of snakes, that slither like centipedes
Only niggas who hesitate bleed, I'm from the mark 'em homes
Go 'head and talk slick, and see more hammers than the Garden and R. Kelly
Nothing but sly bitches and crackhead clientele
Call me on the celly, I used to see visions of myself
Being paralyzed, I guess I beat the odds, or maybe it was the fact
I learnt how to hit hammers, with the presence of God
I breathe to express, one of the livest niggas left
I'mma have Ghost retire, and settle down with some seeds in Bolivia

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
I shall run the town, pound for pound, toe to toe
Blow for blow, your bitch is a washed up mob hoe
Pull out the calico and let the cavalry go
Rest in peace to the God Imf, Juny and O.D. Bob's a snitch
Don Makaveli's a pimp, free radio, gorilla general status
Like Big Un, east side, the Sha Blood and N.O.
Big Den, husky bar brawls, the board put a stern on Benny Boy
But don't worry when you get home, the block's size by the pennies, boy
Reminiscing, like loaded hammers at the Denny's, out of town, boy
And ain't nothing about me soft, and if we gotta kill off Officer Brown
Karrell won't see up north, nigga

[Chorus]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, street shit, nigga
What you know about that crack, nigga?</pre>
