All you just tryin' to bring me down
Let me come up
I'm gonna come up
I got a thing to tell you

[VERSE 1]
I been in many relationships
Some never meant shit
Some gave me joy like I just won a championship
Some with shy women
Some with some bad ass chicks
Fuck your best friend while you're away make -you-mad-chick
Maybe I'm shady or Gnarls Barkley crazy
Or Charles Barkley frankly
You don't thank me
Speak my mind happily
Some relationships die tragically and
Logically we all related sorta biologically
I call you my sister
I never meant to diss ya
But u buggin and naggin
No more loving
You keep pushin' me back like Def Jam did Joe Budden's album
X marks the spot like Malcolm
I wonder what will be the outcome
If men got pregnant 
And felt PMS and all that mess
Brenda's got a baby
I heard she ain't been feelin' good lately
Frustration
But don't bring me down
Kinda like ejaculation
[laughs]

[CHORUS]
I can use that kinda loving
But please don't bring me down
I can use that kinda loving
But please don't bring me down
I can use that kinda loving
But please baby girl don't bring me down

[VERSE 2]
I said two can play the game but only one can win
Once said my e dash my next of kin
And baby you can ask him if you like
When it's that time of the night
The freaks come out, but
Freaks ain't really my type
M.anifest craves for sophisticated
Rare kinda women only Prince coulda dated
And if you wasn't seethin' with hatred
I'd shower you with compliments to make you confident all naked
Don't [bring me down]
Honey child I could make you feel elevated
Like Christmas trees so decorated
You remind me of New Year's Eve, you should be celebrated
Kinda like a temple, girl, you sacred
Never should be desecrated
Deserve an Oscar, should be Grammy nominated
Go shorty it's your birthday
Happy belated
Kinda like scotch on the rocks
You my favorite
But your attitude got me jaded
And I hope you don't [bring me down]
Cuz I'm gonna come up like a comedian
I'm a stand-up kinda guy
So why try to tell a lie
Look me in the eye I reply
Is it really real or am I just another guy
Baby girl
So for what's it worth
Take me as I am
As a man that can hurt and be hurt back
You scratch mine and I'll scratch your back
No more frustration
Don't bring me down like ejaculation

CHORUS
