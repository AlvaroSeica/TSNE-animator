Evacuate the place! I spit mase
Switch styles like switchblades put it to your bitch face
Slice newcomers like cucumbers uhuh
styles humongous now who want us?
Only a few 'mong us, but we roll like two hundreds
true brothers. What you wanna do fuckers?
You only mad cus I got your boo's numbers
Well I'm mad cus she gave my crew fungus
So, your stinkin' ass I sweep under the rug
Fiendin' for beef I'm deep under the drug
Keep competition tailormade with razorblades
Icecold, lampin' Flavor flav's: delicious
Fulfillin' all your wishes if you wish for me to spit till you swim with the fishes
I drown your whole continent
Saliva drippin' my mouth is incontinent
You think I'm playing then consider your odds:
to go against me is considered a loss
The way I write I'm getting rid of the laws
topics, flows, rhymes, deliveries - all!

[Chorus]
Who want it? Come get it, we got it, let's set it
off right now, I know my whole crew's ready
If it's on it's on, if it goes down then let it
You little bitch ass, that's right I said it

Supreme is, at your service miss, oops, mistress
Kiss his wack ass goodbye, let's do our business
Ze troop*? The shiznit, each time you dumb asses
we shine, make blind people wear sunglasses
Define a hot crew, that's us right there
Middle fingers in the air, waving at you queers
Now cheers, pour a little out for your careers
slit from ear to ear, by this here cut, you hear?
Supreme's over your head, tomorrow morning
hung over in your bed, your fling was over she said
So, dead that diss song, don't ever say my name
you can't trashtalk me kid, when you ainÂ´t game
Now I'm blamed, cus her arms around me like a necklace
and you're left one neck less, when it's you that's reckless
You need stretchers, first aid kits in your riders
Even if you had hits, you couldn't get with the livest

[Chorus]

Take two steps back you're too close to this fire arm
Ring the alarm! Another soundbwoy is gone
Try to be number one, yeah you wishin'
Looptroop is a nightmare to mc's &amp; politicians
They run off as soon as we start to bun up
you little fuck up reachin' for the mic i cut your hand off
You and your boys wanna sound like us
Used to be dissin', now you want the pounds from us?
Fuck that! We overthrow corrupt sound systems
underground misfits kill that weak shit from a distance
Break your resistance easy like toothpicks
Looptroop is so sick make your whole crew ditch
The shit we spit is banned from radio stations
cus we tellin' kids to put their mark on end stations
Intimidation tactics, gain victory instantly
It's on, David versus the industry

[Chorus]</pre>
