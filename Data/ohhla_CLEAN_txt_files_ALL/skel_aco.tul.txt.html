Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Thought I needed your love
Thought I needed your favour
Thought I needed your follow
Dreams of being your favourite
Cut your slice of the pie
Take pieces of me
The taste is living out
Gonna' spit it out
I'll never be your hero
I have too many flaws
No shining night in armour
I'll never be your star
I'd rather be the darkness
Than to lie in the light..
Rather be the one you love
Than who you lie like you know my secrets

That makes you hold me
Offend me
Don't let
Simply exorcising demons, You never admit you're just like me
You know all of my secrets
That makes you holier than me
Don't let
What like a drug
I've been feeling
When we know
We all
Have that
Closet full of skeletons

Never be what you want
And never tear right through your eyes
Seems I can't win for loosing

So why should I fucking try?
Don't ever strike a match
Don't ever light a fire
Hey Mr Stone thrower
Make sure you aim higher
See these ashes on my shoulder

I've survived fire before
So baby do what you please
So baby do what you do
I'm not talking today
But tomorrow it's you</pre>
