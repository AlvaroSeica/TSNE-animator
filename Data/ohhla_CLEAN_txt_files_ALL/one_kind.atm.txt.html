[Slug talking to crowd]
I'm different because I respect my audience and I don't yell at them...
And I'm special because I respect my audience... (Guy in crowd: YA!)
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

[Slug]
The way she listen to what the MC said
She might as well plug the RCA cords into her head
Taking that into consideration, at the center of creation
Cats still criticize my frustration raps
Well off he goes, come and cop some flows
Cross your toes in hopes that I don't climb you like an obstacle
Mission Impossible, fishin' in the kitchen sink
Ya'll'll fall for anything so what you think this kid'll bring?
Poker face, let me hold my place, the name's sake(?) Slug
But you? You can call me so(?) grace
Open invitation to catch today's ejaculation
All across the front of your pretty little apron (Bitch)
This goes to those that wanna mouthful of Sean's load
Thanks for startin' now you're barkin' down the wrong road
Sacrifice plays a part in grabbin' mics from now till the afterlife
I'll continue, pass(?) it like I love this fuckin' whore with all my heart
And ain't nobody gonna stop me from doin' my part
It gave me life, it saved me life, it raised me right
So slideshow decide (slide shoulder side), and please hand over that mic

[Chorus x2]
Who am I? [2nd: What is this?]
One of a kind
Send em' one at time
You're all the same
Only separate by kick snares and names
Some of ya'll even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby show no shame

[Slug]
So point a finger at the sucker that's havin' a good summer
Ain't got no bread, no wheat, no Wonder
But I got the phone number to this weakness I know
Who can put me back together, make me feel whole
So take me apart, try to break me down
And spend all you got just to hate the clown
You can fake the frown, imitate the sound
Underworld, worldwide, wide world of underground
It goes one little, two little, three little indie rap
Headphones, backpack, watch em' all piggy back
Switch up my styles, they all complain but see
Which kids next year sound the same as me!
The same shit, yesterday was like today
Only difference is I trust even less of what you say
But all in all, I still make the noise
I still break the toys, I still hate your voice
I still say, "Fuck a major label till it limps!"
Put your deal upon our table and we'll show you who's the pimp
There is no sympathy for the careless
Fuck the extra credit, and fuck the demerits
Class dismissed

[Chorus x2]
One of a kind
Send em' one at time
You're all the same
Only separate by kick snares and names
Some of ya'll even share the same names
So fuck you and your lies baby show no shame
What is this?

Who am I? One of a kind, one at a time...
So fuck you and your lies baby show no shame</pre>
