do or die

I let it be known from the jump that this was Christ for life
He put me on with this life and since we bangin I got to get my stripes
lay in the cut, with my Bible in front my gut
and when I jump up, you know the fallen angels duck
or break and runnin, and as for prisoners I'm takin none
I'm on raise you that rep, now you ain't starin down the shakin gun (??)
I'm singin demons die, was thinkin for survival trippin (??)
I binds em up in the Name of Jesus, then I Bible whip em
so if you wicked make sure you still steppin
and my Bible might remain a concealed weapon
see, prayer is how my text spit, my Bible's my next clip
I worship and praise the G, you step to me and you get checked quick
see you dealin with a Saved thug
and when I put on my gloves demons get no love, just mo slugs
now when the mob, they points the finger at me
I keep my Bible in my khaki, plus I'm trigger happy, yeah
I gangs bang everyday, I cant stay neutral
cuz satan hate my gut so the feeling stay mutual
I'm real with the Son so real is how I come
I never been a mark, if I'm a do it then its done
its Jesus Christ for life, and satan K all day
and I'm on represent that rhyme until I flatline
to all the Christians stay on deck, cause you and i
in 96 we chew or fry, we do or die (??)

(do or die)
I'm do or die, I'm do or die
I dont know about you but i, be do or die
I'm do or die, I'm do or die
either God has got a vault or God ain't got it all, gangsta
(do or die)
I'm do or die, I'm do or die
I dont know about you but i, be do or die
I'm do or die, I'm do or die
either God has got a vault or God ain't got it all, gangsta

to do or to die, thats my options
I chose do and I ain't stoppin it from the east to the west, its poppin
clear the way when I come out, wit my gun out
I'm committed to the Cross, I wont run out
id rather be 6 feet deep sleep before retreat
no defeat, all is obsolete when I pulls heat
used to be from the set
used to be down, used to get respect, but check
day from the 2 to deaf die hard, went to pull thy card (??)
rather die scarred, oh my Lord
I got the keys, he gave me these
get on my knees, been around them Doub-Double G's (??)
these homies id ride fo, I cry fo
and if it came down to it id die fo
reject Christ, the penalty is death, genius
and you can tell by my face that I mean this
I'm do or die

repeat chorus

I'm do or die, Christ or crack you must learn that
if I retreat and turn back that means I burn black
took my Salvation lightly till it occurred to me
that it was legions of demons tryin to murder me, hurt a G
a Christian, not a victim to this crime rate
they set it off now door die is my mind state
either you gone do his will and step, and die
cuz the wages of sin is death, ain't nothin left
you cant be goin on like a sucka sayin "God I'm a trust ya"
and back out like a busta
satan knocked and said "Chill, let me in"
I said "not by the hairs of my Chille Chill chin"
win, lose, or draw, stand or fall
cuz either God is got a vault or God ain't got it all, gangsta
its a shame what the media do to a guy
I told you last album I was do or die

(do or die)
I'm do or die, I'm do or die
I dont know about you but i, be do or die
I'm do or die, we do or die
either God has got a vault or God ain't got it all, gangsta
(do or die)
I'm do or die, I'm do or die
I dont know about you but i, be do or die
we do or die, we do or die (fo now)
either God has got a vault or God ain't got it all, gangsta

wsup kid ??
whats happenin ??
whats up, jay cuz
all right
hey, we done crossed enemy lines, loc
we in too deep now
no turnin back
we miss that coil, we do or die
you do or die ??
yeah, I'm do or die, ain't no two litters about it
couldnt deny it even if we tried it
yeah
they'll never catch me, never capture me
until Jesus come back and Rapture me
they cant capture me
until Jesus comes to Rapture me
they'll never catch me, never capture me
until Jesus come back and Rapture me
they'll never catch me, never capture me
until Jesus come back and Rapture me
