(Verse 1 -Squeak Ru)
Money, hoes and narcotics
Bitches, riches and hydraulics
Got to fill my cup to the rim
My chances of [live it ?] is gettin slim
Cuz ahh, niggas playa hate me
Now the YGs think they can take me
They think the big homie got sore
But as soon as they freak, I'm lettin off, nigga

(Verse 2 -Binky Mack)
Hoo-ridin on you bustas, whuuuuut
We don't know you 
Commit the same [???], throwin up the W
Always saggin wit my drink in hand
And when a nigga talks shit that's when he hits the [fan ?]
Breakin laws for the cause is a habit
Up in ya spot, jack move, I gots to have it
Break [bread ?] wit my nigga [Squeak/Spliff ?]
And all I'm thinkin 'bout is gettin rich, so...

Chorus:
Guess who just stepped out the smog...
...it's Connect Gang, nigga, 'bout to take em all
Guess who just stepped out the smog...
...AllFrumThaI 'bout to break these niggas off
Your money or your life, nigga
Don't make me have to put these caps in ya
Cuz I, I gots to get paid, nigga
Won't stop till they put me in my grave, nigga

(Verse 3 -Squeak Ru)
All I can dream is the undreamable
All I can think is the unthinkable
Explodin like a goddamn bomb
Niggas be alarmed, the Fat Man spread like napalm
All my thoughts is suicidal
My hand is the [???] and the 9 is the [???]
Open up the door to my world
Watch the blood rush my vein
While my brain twirls
I only takes one shot from the heater
I got the remedy for you [???]
No peels, no [cuffed rocks ?]
Just a nine millimeter wit the (shoot)
It don't stop, so...

Chorus

(Verse 4 -Binky Mack)
Now I bounce thru my [???], whuuuut
A nigga fresh out, lil' homies never seen befo'
[Banged out ?], used to hustle, shootin craps and shit
Now a nigga spittin raps, gettin snaps and shit
[Sick brawls ?] for the flaws wit the [???]
Right color hit the wrong hood, so I stay strapped
AllFrumThaI peels like hocuspocus
Hoes that actin [???] now they all [below ?] us
Not livin here, don't hold back
Nigga doin big thangs like I got to sack
And it's like that and it just don't stop
Binky Mack and my town is that 500 block, so...
