[Rap Verse 1: Ak'sent]
We got the dudes gazin'
All the shorties hatin'
Pretty girls roll it up
Start to blazin'
See our relation
No hesitation
For us to burn it up
And lay it on the pavement
Let it all out
You could scream and shout
I must, AK' a tell ya what it's all about
We takin' our cream
Believe that we clean
On a hot summer day, we owns the scene
International
From head to toe
And if you didn't know
Yo, then now you know
We rippin' the flow
We stackin' the dough
Matchin' Bentleys and ma
What up, Double
It's nothin' to a boss
See my time costs
So if you tryin' to floss
Then homie, get lost
Cause you get lost
And my time pause
So if you tryin' to floss
It's nothin' to a boss

(Verse 2)
Doko yuku ni mo
Kuruma no doa wa dareka ga akeru
Shikata nai desho
Sore ga Double no star to sutaitasu
It took a long time
To climb up over here shiranai desho?
Kizuite kita no
Mai buraindo (By myself)
D-O-U-B-L-E

Repeat Chorus

[Rap Verse 2: Ak'sent]
Real girls get down on the floor
They say I keep it sexy from L.A. to Tokyo
They say it's kinda sexy how I'm getting this dough
And then it's so addictive, so I flow to get more
Yo
It's kinda hard, whippin' 'em cars
Explain it to ya girl that I'm a superstar
And I ain't got time
For your games and laws
Just hand me over them credit cards (Ak'sent)
This summer
We do it B.I.G.
All I understand is shopping sprees
All I understand is watch and rings
We doin' it, doin' it, yeah, we do it like that

Hook: Ak'sent
Now ladies
Where ya at, where ya at?
We doin' it, doin' it, yeah, we do it like that
Fellas
Where ya at, where ya at?
We doin' it, doin' it, yeah, we do it like that

Repeat Chorus
