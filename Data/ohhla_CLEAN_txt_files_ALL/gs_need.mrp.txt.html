(Intro, Master P)
I told ya
You held me down, whatever I got is yours baby
I know we come from the streets
We doin our thang now
You ain't gotta stress now
Uhh!
Tell me how ya feel baby!
Take the Bentley, Rover, Porsch, or the Mercedes!

(Hook, Unidentified female vocalist)
Since you've been away
I've been down and lonely (Huh, what)
Since you've been away (Huh, what)
I've been thinking of you (Huh, what, huh, what)

(Verse 1, Master P)
Got you living in mansions
Jumping out of 'Benzes
Dressed in all Louie clothes
Baguette faced presidential Rolex watches
You used to wear swatches
Done took you out the ghetto
Now your name is Ms. Versace
Louie Vuitton purses
Moet with your Reeces, Hershey's
And have tours on tuesdays and thursdays
Even though I'm livin wrong
Tryin'a get my hustle on
I want you in your birthday suit when I get home
So I can UHHHHHH! Then squeeze ya
Then tease ya, let the Ice Cream Man please ya
Stayed around when my money was low
Now I'm back, get whatever from the store
Fuck a fire car, keep it on the low
You know I love ya, cause ya help me on my chores
Now I'm back, we can drink, shop, and smoke
Fuck them haters while we ride in the ghost

(Hook, Unidentified female vocalist)
Since you've been away
I've been down and lonely (Huh, what)
Since you've been away (Huh, what)
I've been thinking of you (Huh, what, huh, what)
Try to understand, the reason you left me
What were you going throughhhh
Ooooohhhhh, I've been missin you (Uhh! Tell me how ya feel baby!)
Tell me where the road tuuuurns (Take the Bentley, Rover, Porsch, or the Mercedes!)
Ooooohhhhh, I've been missin you (Uhh! Tell me how ya feel baby!)
Tell me where the road tuuuurns (Take the Bentley, Rover, Porsch, or the Mercedes!)

(Verse 2, Alley Boy)
Too many penitentiary chances
That's when I was broke, hands ashy
Now you say I'm too flashy
Wishin I could change your heart, buy you a car
You the one that should be signing autographs, you a star
Since you went away
Wish I could fix my baby girl heart I broke
I wanna take you on a cruise in my boat
I wanna buy you everythang
Louie everythang, get Versace everythang
Buy you Chanel everythang
You the one I want
Girl you got a nigga sick
I don't want another chick
Please forgive me for that shit that I did
So I dedicate this verse to you
Career gangstas need love too
We need love too

(Hook, Unidentified female vocalist)
Since you've been away
I've been down and lonely (Huh, what)
Since you've been away (Huh, what)
I've been thinking of you (Huh, what, huh, what)
Ooooohhhhh, I've been missin you (Uhh! Tell me how ya feel baby!)
Tell me where the road tuuuurns (Take the Bentley, Rover, Porsch, or the Mercedes!)
Ooooohhhhh, I've been missin you (Uhh! Tell me how ya feel baby!)
Tell me where the road tuuuurns (Take the Bentley, Rover, Porsch, or the Mercedes!)

(Verse 3, Fat Trel)
And she be fuckin me, lovin me
And kissin me, missin me
I'm flyin, takin trips
And I be shopping in Italy
It ain't no forgettin me
I heard your mother missin me
I left her for Tennessee
Your sister remember me
I'm poppin this ecstacy
I'm fuckin for energy
In Cali' I'm Louie V
They think I'm from New Orleans
Bitch, I'm from D.C.
I'm rollin with two heats
In the A where Alley be
Caliope, big P
I represent S.B.
So she never stress me
And I want her girlfriend
But she won't let me
I represent all the freaks
And she never stress me
And I want her girlfriend
And she won't let me be

(Hook, Unidentified female vocalist)
Since you've been away
I've been down and lonely (Huh, what)
Since you've been away (Huh, what)
I've been thinking of you (Huh, what, huh, what)
Try to understand, the reason you left me
What were you going throughhhh
Ooooohhhhh, I've been missin you (Uhh! Tell me how ya feel baby!)
Tell me where the road tuuuurns (Take the Bentley, Rover, Porsch, or the Mercedes!)
Ooooohhhhh, I've been missin you (Uhh! Tell me how ya feel baby!)
