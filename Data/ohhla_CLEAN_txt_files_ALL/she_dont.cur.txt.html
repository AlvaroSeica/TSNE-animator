Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
She was a little red Corvette, fast as hell, turned heads on the set
Pretty skin, soft voice, asking for rough sex
Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets,
This particular evening she wanted to ride jets
Even though I knew shawty was bad news, I played it cool
Vowing to never turn sucker like them other dudes
Misreading signals, attachment issues,
Getting way too into the grip of the vagina lips
Got homies searching for relationships,
She not tryna hear my type of bitch
She ran a story to me over grape juice and ciroc sips
Married to a doctor, cuddle master
Don't fuck her just buy her her anything tryna satisfy her
On the low, she fucking his partners, feel a void inside her
Cause she wasn't fucking with a rider

[Chorus]
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
He tell her balance the check book, I tell her roll the weed up
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
He tell her to drop the kids off, I tell her pick my homies up
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck

[Verse 2]
From talking it out to the parking lot
From the parking lot to my safe house
Tommy Vercetti, Spitta Andretti, this is New Jack City
Most bitches ain't ready
But Shawty ain't tripping, she was living already
My f-ck game impressive so she come back steady.
The shit, while heavy I can carry it
Cant get too far I mean this isn't marriage bitch
She roll doobies as I paddle shift
We fuck, watch movies, end up getting too groovy
And then we smash again, she talking about him
How she feel bad about feeling so good, by giving me the ass
Bout how if she could, she a tell a nigga everything to get it off her chest
But she don't want see him, mad,
Collecting her underwear from the rooms of my pad
She got dressed and left in a flash
But she saying she be back!

[Chorus]
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
He tell her balance the check book, I tell her roll the weed up
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
He tell her to drop the kids off, I tell her pick my homies up
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck

[Verse 3]
Couple days roll by, Shawty callin' askin' if I have time
To put a couple in the air I was like, yeah
We could fly more than a pair there's plenty over here
She fell through like always
We broke it down in the hallway
She bossed her way back she don't crawl away
Her body designed Frank Cartier
Say something talking heavy on her heart today
Telling her the situation is wrong and she should walk away
Cause her feelings was coming into play
Affecting her home life in all kinda ways
Her man askin her whats wrong she don't know what to say,
But she do got a union to save
But she in love with the lust that we've made
She had far too much she could say
That fucking me was a perfect mistake

[Chorus]
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
He tell her balance the check book, I tell her roll the weed up
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck
He tell her to drop the kids off, I tell her pick my homies up
She don't want a man, she just wanna fuck</pre>
