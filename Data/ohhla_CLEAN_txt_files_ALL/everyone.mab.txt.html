[Hook - 2x]
Stepping out the big Caddy, just call me big daddy
I got these hoes on my team, even they kids love me
Cause we don't wanna hurt y'all, we just wanna work y'all
We just wanna love y'all, every single one of y'all

[Trae]
Never knew that I could do something real, love the girls and make them go tell
They mommas, they aunties, they sisters and friends
Now working over time, keeping em coming in
Getting checked in and getting out, put the third leg in then put it on out
Breathe and stop show me what you got, I love to have sex that ain't no doubt
Know what I'm talking bout, running through y'all like I'm in a parking lot
Like a pitbull I'ma make em bark a lot, and like Jodeci I'ma make em freak a lot
Now what's my name, I know you can't forget it, the way I did it and hit it
Making you wanna go get it, while I be running up in it
And then wanna come back, just like that and then feet to back
Now tell me how you love that

[Dougie D]
What the deal going down boo, you know the Dougie D
That'd be stepping out of the leather, fifth wheel that recline too
Got love for you, got love for you, and you, and you
I wanna get with, ain't trying to beat y'all boo
Seems to be I can't help myself, cause the girls the girls
Know I'm known to rock worlds, I smack another pimping
And rubbing em down, I put it all in her mouth she likes it she likes it
You know me I'ma give it to you, the way its suppose to be gave
We pulling up to you like a Hebrew slave, and when I hit it, it go da-da-da-da
The monkey get wetter from every second, that I pump and punch it
I'ma leave it on slump, the daddy will get it and every time now what
Ain't come to hurt you, came to work you, and twerk you
Do I love you I sure do, cause you my boo (uh huh)

[Hook 2]
See I ain't tripping baby, I'm down with every single one of y'all
See I ain't tripping baby, I got that work for every one of y'all
See I ain't tripping baby, I'm down with every single one of y'all
See I ain't tripping baby, I got that work for every one of y'all

[Dougie D]
Come and get what you need, off on the ground until your knees get weak
Manage tois freaky fantasies and you could suck these, and I could rub these
And she could touch these, we all could be pleased, Dougie D a P-I-M-P
I love the girls cause the girls love me, I'ma continue to slang E-N-T
And the way that you feeling, you better come and see me
Better believe a hundred percent naunchy, nothing but freaky
She going all round me, love the way daddy gotta be for the anogomy
Be turning your body freaky deaky, I loving the way you sucking on her titties
When I convince you jamming, body rocking and stabbing
All from the back, and hollin' about you loving the Dougie Daddy

[Trae]
Now I can't deny the way that she ride, up and down, side to side
All through the night we doing it raw, I got X in her life just the type of job
See I ain't no pimp I's a game shooter, got every type of woman that I could
Think of from Puerto Rican, Yellow Bone to Filipino, I ain't capping I'm trying
To spread the love, stop tripping baby girl you only working a little bit
Be cool we both gonna benefit, ride around town drop top sipping in the wind
I'll make you wanna (RRRR), every time I'm digging in
Like Anna Marie, Kiki and Rochelle, now what about Cantrel
I promised I wouldn't tell, but up in the motel Whitney on Rachel
Menage-a-trois, we doing it very well
