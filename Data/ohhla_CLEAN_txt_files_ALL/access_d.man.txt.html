[Intro: Prozak]
Tech N9ne! Prozak! King Gordy! Access Denied!

[Verse 1: Prozak]
All my life I been denied, 7th grade attempted suicide
Remained alive, isolated state of my mind
Confined to prison
my visions of multiple killing
I've tried to fit in different clinks
Raps, jocks, or the chinks
So what the fuck? I'm trynna find a place to call my own
9th grade trial by jury, only 16 years old
Found not guilty back in '93 victim of society
Hatred and mass murder and thoughts inside of me
My mind exposed to a paradox of pain
It's all the same, playa haters speakin my name in vain
Underground rap game king
9 milimeter, brains, flames, comin out of your vains
From Detroit to KC fuck the industry (why?)
Because they hate me, they wanna but the can't be me
I guess that's how I'm depicted, arrested but never convicted
Prozak, King Gordy, Tecca Ninna, Self Inflicted

[Hook: Prozak]
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I don't make my music for no motherfucking whites
I don't make my music for no motherfucking blacks
To keep Ninna's project steady runnin of the shelfs
I make my music for my motherfucking self
Fuck the industry with a tip stuffed full of henessy
Then take the torch of this shit and bust on my enemies
Positive energy, you could not change me
You got that beat, I take that beat and flip it strangely
The major labels did not know what to do with me
You knew I was crazy if you went to school with me
Created a king kong because I sing songs
Got hoes on labels swingin on ding dongs
World wide respected
Ya boy said we ain't kissin no motherfuckin ass to be accepted
That's what I'm talkin bout, rapless revived
You trynna get inside? Access denied

[Hook: Prozak]
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)

[Verse 3: King Gordy]
How many times must you die just to live?
Suicides on your mind so you kill
Your whole life trynna find something real
Your whole life confined tight and sealed
Don't you lie to me Christ cuz you will
Cuz then I might put you right where I live
Eternal lights the nights are in hell
Soul downsized cuz we blinded by shields
Spineless ,you just trynna hide your own fears
It is priceless you are dyin right here
Why am I crucified by my peers?
As a child trynna hide my own tears
I'll keep my pride despite how I feel
With the knife beside it's a thrill
Gordy, Prozak, and Tech N9ne is so ill
You tried to die, access denied, please try again

[Hook: Prozak]
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)
ACCESS DENIED! (Access denied! Access denied! Access denied!)</pre>
