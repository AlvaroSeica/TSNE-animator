Typed by: Tha Masta

[Intro: La the Darkman]
Eh, eh, eh... eh, eh...

[La the Darkman]
Sippin' on that yak, Grey Goose or that Petron
See me at the party, don't be comin' at me wrong
Got .357 and the barrel very long
If I squeeze the trigger, nigga, you gon' poof be gone
Don Cannon got me open, playin' one of Biggie's songs
Mix the Kush with that Hennessey and I'll be in the zone
I'm rollin' with the Romans like I'm livin' in Rome
Take a bad bitch up out the crowd, take her to my home
Grab hold to her, then stick hole to her
Beat the pussy up, tryin' to tear a new hole through her
From Bankhead to Buckhead, I'ma stay fly
Miami to LA, they all know me, this La

[Chorus x2: La the Darkman]
We be sippin' on that yak, sippin' on Petron
Sippin' on that Goose, got my hand on the chrome

[Willie the Kid]
Aiyo I'm back like Essos, about to be, ring ya bell
Bring ya best man, these rap niggaz don't amount to me
Shake them haters off, niggaz mad cuz I'm about to be
Front row seats, I'm backstage doin' the balcony
Willie never trick, not a cent, I get the mouth free
Take 'em to the house and kick 'em out, about the count of three
Count on me, I tell a nigga, tell a bitch, I say the same
So fuck a nigga, fuck a bitch, I get my change
Man, I'm 'bout mine, nigga, I'm 'bout my grind, nigga
You moved out ya mama house, about time, nigga
I've been down, I've been up, I nailed asleep, I've been up
My niggaz rollin' up, throwin' ones up at pin-ups

[Chorus x2]

[Outro: La the Darkman (Willie the Kid)]
You know, that's how we do, man
You know, we wiggle all over the globe
You know, we gon' sprinkle some ones, man (I need change for a hundred)
Have a little fun, you know? (I need change for a hundred)
Mix, mack and mingle (yo change that)
You know, that's how it goes (some of that Henny too man)
You know I mean? S.S.R., A.M.G., man
Yeah know, break bread, nigga (that Petron)
We got them stacks, nigga
Believe they on deck, nigga
Holla at me when you see me in the street, man
(White liquor's for the chicks, man, pass that Henny)
That's how it go</pre>
