[Intro: Nashawn]
Money Machine, uh
Check me out now, yea, uh
Check me out now, uh
Money Machine, uh, uh, yea
Check me out now

[Nashawn]
Yo, uh you see that Benz her friends wanna ride in it
Switch it out to Automatic and she ride on Stick
Baby Girl nice sizin', thighs all thick
I'm half there Mami, soon be rich
And that Money Machine is squirtin' out Benji's
Don't count $1's, $20's, or $50's
Stay wit me until you see my Pock knot empty
Propz on the block, $1,000 Bills Crispy
Bitches always wanna kiss me
Knowin' when she miss me
Not tellin' her man say she wit Britney
Knowin' I'mma have my dick where her Ribs be
Goin' all crazy tryin' to shift Kidney
And I know why she pick me
Hoes from Yit, and ?*Periphery*?
Down south, West side and Sicily
She got love in her Bones
The way I come down, Nashawn Jones

[Hook: Nashawn (Jungle)] **2X**
All Summer Long (All Summer)
We Stackin' Cheddar (Get Money)
And it neva felt so hard (QB c'mon)
Money Machine (Machine)
We got that Coco Triple Kilo (Kilos)
When they see us they scream (Scream)

[Jungle]
Pretty Young thang only little freak, stop frontin'
Take your pants off, let's get it jumpin'
You look good, Could I see how your pussy feel ?
For real, you got a whole lot of Sex Appeal
I'm from the Projects -&gt; QB where the P's at
Sellin' Crack, bustin' gats and that's all that
Your ass Phat tell your Baby Pops fall back
Or relax I will hit 'em up wit the Mac
But you I'm Puttin' different Position
Baby Girl listen, I'll be your addiction
Your legs hard no stretch mark on your Stomach
I hit it right, every night just like you want it
I got your G spot cutie pie I won't stop
You come lie on top sex wasn't hot
You got an Onion wit a Small Waist
Smell so good I wanna see how you taste

[Hook: Nashawn (Jungle)] **2X**
All Summer Long (All Summer)
We Stackin' Cheddar (Get Money)
And it neva felt so hard (QB c'mon)
Money Machine (Machine)
We got that Coco Triple Kilo (Kilos)
When they see us they scream (Scream)

[Wiz]
You see my mental lop, got a thing for cop
She throwin' her ass at me, I'm hopin' to see it drop
I'm hopin' to see the pussy, I'm hopin' to see it pop
She tippy, tippy GOD DAMN! now let me see it live
She drop top, now she doin' slower motion
DAMN! that's overdosin' right there
Hold it open, I'm scopin' though she holdin'
Get all greeny she she see's me
That money get me, get me
Do somethin' strange for change
Somethin' needy just for penny
I'mma GANGSTA! P I M P
Braveheart, if you fuck wit me
Niggaz they talk but don't want nuttin' wit me
You see I got these Bitches Hypnotized
I'm runnin' 'em and workin' thorough bred are thighs
YOu see the looks in they eyes, they neva slippin'
They either give me my money, Or else, I'm popin' the clippin'
Don't play me too close or plug wit toast
Money Machine - we give ya a dose
