[Timbaland]
(Bounce, Bounce, Bounce)
Huh
I ain't got no feeling, I'ma let these niggas know
I've been killin 'em with these beats, now I'm spittin' them killer flow
What you know about me dog, not a damn thing
Gotta pop me, nigga shoot me in the streets dog, I'm an one man game
Don't take this lightly, ever won't you did and don't
I can make that happen because Nigga my bread is my own
I've been on both sides of the track, you can say I changed the game
A lot of niggas try to get in my lane, everybody askin' me the same whole thing
What he say

[Chorus] (Timbaland)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)

Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)

[Timbaland]
I ain't goin' nowhere dog, I'ma be right here in your face
Can't do it like me dog, your key drum ain't got enough bass
Don't ever talk bad about me, you just might make me mad
And I just might see you somewhere and brake your ass in half
This not a Timbaland that you used to, now I'm in a whole 'nother zone
You could let me do me you could do you, or get popped in your dong
Hit love for the birds to the block, so recognize the game
Timbaland ain't gotta run nowhere baby, Timbaland got private plane

[Chorus]

[Timbaland singing]
I've been around, some time long ago
I've seen the light, don't act like you ain't seen it before

[Timbaland]
I'm listenin' dog, you ain't sayin' shit
You can keep on wishin', you never make a hit
Yeah I got money, take it all from me, I'm gon' be the same
You can get a few whips you can get a few chips you still gon' be a lame
We ain't the same my nigga, I'm on some other shit
I'ma say this plain it's simple, nigga take this punishment
I'ma take ya'll on a trip, I'ma take ya'll on a ride
And one day I'll gon' dip but I won't be hard to find

[Chorus] (Timbaland)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)

Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to?
Oh Timbaland, where he go run to? (Nowhere)</pre>
