[Intro: G-Roc (Izzy Workin)]
Yo, y'all saw the Sheek Entertainment video (That's right)
Specs love the ladies too (uh-huh)
North Yard exclusive shit (exclusive)

[Intro II: Specman (Izzy Workin)]
North Yard, where we make that money (Preme what up dog?)
(B.P., what up dog?) Uh-huh (Yanahmean? We can't let these girls get us down)
Uh-uh (Can't let 'em get us down)

[Specman]
Aiyo, things ain't the same
Since you left my life, as quick as you came
Here come the rain, but I'm used to the pain
Specman brain is stained (stained), ice water in my veins
He who wanna get outta order, go mess with a lame
I never changed, whipped a Range, I remain the same
Pitch well, hit sell when it swells ya brain
Oh no, oh well, I remain to get mine
But you are my Heaven, girl, kick you off my cloud nine
I move on, just that quick, say goodbye
Don't cry, here's a tissue, you could wipe ya eye
Superstar, you wanna see me? You could look in the sky
I'm doing just fine, without a worry on my mind
Be on the beach and at least waving a tide
Sexy young thing sitting right by my side

[Chorus: Anna w/ ad-libs]
Feel like I just walked right out of Heaven
Feel like I just walked right out of Heaven
Feel like I just walked right out of Heaven
Feel like I just damn near threw my life away
Hey, hey, hey...

[Anna]
There's something missing in my life
And I felt it ever since you left
My heart beats all the time
My feet are moving out of step
When I look around I see
People moving to a common groove
I lost my rhythm somewhere now
I'm off-beat cuz of you
And everywhere I go
I see others so in love
And it's so hard to know
Just what ya fucking up
Gather words to my own song
Now that ya gone
It feels so out of control
No more music in my soul

[Chorus]

[Izzy Workin]
Feel like I'm "Fallin", but I don't see Alicia Keys
I see police, they always trying to arrest me
I mean it in New York, like Stephon Marbury
I hustle, y'all too scary, don't wanna spend time near me
If it's time to sit up, you got my commissary
God put us together, I feel lucky and happy
That's why I wrote this rhyme, and made this song
You got kids and, still look sexy in a thong
It's about us, love you, still got that crush
Ya working hard, get props for trying to help us
You're one of a kind, real women are hard to find
I'm glad ya mine, without diamonds, still'll shine

[Chorus]

[Outro: Izzy Workin]
Yeah, it's another B.P. Production
Devious and Specman, Izzy Workin
Uh, 2004 exclusive, it's over...</pre>
