Uh Werd n Deek
Listen S.O.S.
Yeah Werd n Deek 
Listen (listen)

[Deeko]
Spiting with raw power devour your whole rap catalog
Peep how a murdered the track did it in camouflage
Am able to handle bars when I ride the beat
The same way you ride a bike rolling down your street
So dont try and speak my flows obsolete
The same type of flow that make yours cross the street
You just couldnt compare your metaphors are weak
When I hear you spiting them I fall asleep
Cause its all in the delivery a post it well
A hope to sell a million but gold would be swell
For all you gossiping bitches a dont kiss and tell 
But I do shag and brag got hoes on the bell
There not much a wouldnt do
Not many woman a wouldnt screw
To tell you the truth am as sick as the flu
Writing my lyrics just a thing that I do
Became a habit like a little boy sniffing on glue
So listen to Deek
If you dont you missing the truth
Missing the proof that I'm back so get rid of that bull
Lady and gentlemen a was destined to swing the pendulum
And rip through your intestines with this lyrical excellence
So tell me what you represent
You got the time?
I could take that watch and that chain 
Swinging around your fucking neck (haha)
Its just a thief theme you wouldnt understand
A could take the wrinkles out of your hand
A could take the spine out of your back
Theres no way you could respond to that attack
(Shit) Deeko and Werd stay bombing on a rack
And with this mixtape we switch fate to make our millions out of rap

[Werd]
So what you ken about that?
