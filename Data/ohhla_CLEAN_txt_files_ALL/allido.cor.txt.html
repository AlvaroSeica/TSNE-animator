[Chorus]
All I do think of you
day and night that's all I do
I can't get you off my mind
I think about you all the time
all the time girl

[Corey]
I can't wait to get to school each day
and wait for you to pass my way
and bells start to ring
any angel starts to sing
hey that's the girl for you
so what are you gonna do
hey little girl I love you so

[Chorus]
All I do think of you day
and night that's all I do
I can't get you off my mind
I think about you all the time
all the time girl

[Michael Jackson]
I've been begun to take the long home
just so I can be alone

[Corey]
to think of how to say
your fine in ever way
hey I'm in love with you
I think the world of you

[Michael Jackson]
ohh wouldn't you please,
please be mine

[Chorus]
All I do think of you day
and night thats all I do
I can't get you off my mind
I think about you all the time
all the time girl

[Chorus: Corey &amp; Michael Jackson]
ba ba ba bada ooh
always thinking 'bout you
ba ba ba bada ooh
always thinking 'bout you
ba ba ba bada ooh
always thinking 'bout you
ba ba ba bada ooh
always thinking 'bout you

[Chorus]
All I do think of you day
and night that's all I do
I can't get you off my mind
I think about you all the time

[Corey]
I can't think
I can't sleep
I can't talk
I can't walk
I can't do it girl
no no no no no no yea yea yea

[Chorus till fade]
All I do think of you day
and night that's all I do
I can't get you off my mind
I think about you all the time all</pre>
