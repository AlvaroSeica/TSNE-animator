[Z-Ro]
Lately, my luck has taken a turn for the worse
I used to ride in luxury now I'm headed for a hearse
At least it feels that way; my day-to-day are full of sufferin'
My headaches they be relieved by aspirin or bufferin
Am I tougher than my problems, I like to thinks so, but
Every time I try to rise all I do is sink slow
Like I'm out in the Pacific got my vessel capsized
Seems like I been going through it since I got baptized
It's the Jesus I can feel him all up in my bones
Cause' he be givin' me game on how to live my life long
Can't forget about the Angels at the psychiatric center
Helpin' me to feel like I'm a winner
Got me takin' Lexapro, just so I can improve my mood
Got me feelin' like I'm giant though obstacles better move
Or get flattened in the process of me reachin' to the top
Y'all know that I'm the cream of the crop
And all my people say...

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Get yo' ass up out my way Satan
I got a mansion, robe, and a Crown waitin'
Never again will you catch me livin' in sin
Cause' when the pearly gates open I wanna be steppin' in

[Z-Ro]
I do away wit you devils so I can make it to the top
And remain sane even when a nigga dealing wit a lot
I'm all alone but guess what that's all right (that's all right)
Facing my fears and producing tears that's all night (that's all night)
See I'm a grown man but I still cry sometimes
Cause I'm a sponge soakin' up pain tryin' to come out the rain
I been doin' right all my life and still sufferin'
While murders and crooks out there bubbling
I need a break so many decisions to make
I cant concentrate cause' everybody in my life is so fake
All the years that I wasted lovin' and tryin' to build
With somebody that was never even feeling me fa real
I though I had a family but out the window it went
With all my legal problems and all this beefin with thirty cents
I'm a loner pill on the post solo on the corner
Bitch don't know nothing bout Joseph she just want Z-Ro to bone her
But I'm old school til' I'm in my burial plot
I just need a lady to dig me when I'm dealin' with a lot

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
Ain't no happy feelingz in the air
So lately I been searchin' for happiness through my prayers
Holy father can you hear me when I'm down on my knees (down on my knees)
I need a bridge over troubled water save me please (save me please)
I'm just a lost soul tryin' to find his way back home
Everything I love been takin' away from me now I'm alone
But its all good tell me when's the sun go shine
On this nothing ass motherfuckin life of mine
Mama its been 20 years since I seen yo face
Do me a favor ask god if I'm included in his grace?
Cause I'm feelin' abandoned like the last man standing
So much poverty and pain this ain't the way that I planned it
All I wanted to do was make a little money and split
Take care of my people and grow old with grandchildren and shit
I'm still happy even if my cases don't get dropped
And remain sane even when a nigga dealin' with a lot

[Chorus]</pre>
