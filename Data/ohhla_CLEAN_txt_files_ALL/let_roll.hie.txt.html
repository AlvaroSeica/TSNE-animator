[Pep Love] Yo, who is it?
[Tajai] Yeah!  Make my voice sound clear like that!
[Pep Love] There!
[Tajai] Yeah!
[Pep Love] We keep it raw
[Tajai] Rare!
[Pep Love] That's my nigga!

[Tajai]
Yo there is no escape!
No recourse when I resort to forces of sorts reserved for bloodsports
Swerve up on a curb!
Smash the sheriff
Hop out with words
Leave him unnerved
Blast a burner in your general vicinity
Pin it on your proximity I'm sending these to rock endlessly
Check your posture!
Posthumously your props had you propped up
Now you're being on top and chopped up

[Pep Love]
Knocked off and awestruck
With a touch of destruction
Catch a southpaw punch [ding!] when I step in the function
Fluctuating and punctuating you punks with one puncture
Making you unsure what you front for
Pep Love:
Fire water wizard with an exquisite, explicit exhibit of my entire arsenal
Artful and thoughtful, awful and trecherous regiment catching 'em
Off guard when I stretch and bend [uh!]
Blend with my kin [kin!]
Put my work in [in!]
Keep the party perkin', make a new friend
Chill with the children!
Family and humanity, can it be an illusion?

[chorus]
[Tajai] Hieroglyphics yeah
[Pep Love] To the kick
[Tajai] And the snare like that!
[Pep Love] There!

[Pep Love] Hat
[Tajai] Boom
[Pep Love] Cap

[Tajai] Like that

[Tajai]
Yo it's the redefinition of clever, the hot stepper
Mic checker, chin checker, bitch [biyatch!] checker
You beat me? Man, whatever
I'll battle you wherever whenever
Rattle you in every endeavor
I!
Just get better and better
A vegan and I never wear leather
But still a cannibal
Flying high like a human cannonball
Up up and away! While I'm puffin' a jay
All that gas up in your tank, you're gonna make a fucking mistake!
Clutch the snake by the fat of his neck behind his jaws
Find a soft spot
Sink my venom and render it into him
Any and every enemy entering in the interim finna get
Finished to they last flimsy filament
They ALL feelin' it!
Militant
Resident of Oz, innocent so save!
Your soft sentiments for somebody who give a shit!
I
Rack your body with concussive attacks
Leaving divets and dents
The methods with which my tone pivot and shift
Are sufficient to those with
Our sedition in small doses
But it's still explosive

[Pep Love]
Uh
I apply a fly variety of my replies
Getting cooperative on a privatized
Droppin' this hip hop in this modern day metropolis
Optimistic mystic thoughts in the midst of the mouth of madness
Belly of the beast and blaphemous
Acts of massive disasterous
Diverging in masses
Clashing classes emerging and we urging Revolution!
Vast social change
I bring coastal rains, smoke and flame
Spoken, to envoke my pain
And put it to song
I'm sure-footed and strong
Pep steps in increments to jet set
An exception to the mediocrity
Monotony and hipocrisy, that hip hop is weak!
Continuing through the darkness, holding the light
Molding my soldiers right when I'm holding the mic
