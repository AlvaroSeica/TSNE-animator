[Intro]
("Dumb rappers need teaching" - Biggie)
Okay so two rappers come out the jewelry store
with their two bling chains on, right?
And they're going to their car, it's a Mustang
And when they get they realize that they locked the keys in the car
So they're fiddling with the locks for hours trying to pick it
So suddenly the guy that owns it says
"Yo hurry up, it's 'bout to rain, and I left the top down!"
{*crowd laughter*}

[Chorus: Random]
Yeah I know that I posess the rhyme
to stretch your mind with beats by Hexsagon
We gon' ROCK to the rhythm, ROCK to the rhythm
Don't STOP 'til it hit 'em, word
And plus I got the streets and the cons and the geeks and the dons
on the beats and the rhymes if you seek you can find
We gon' ROCK to the rhythm, ROCK to the rhythm
Don't STOP 'til it hit 'em, word, yes sir~!

[Random]
Yo, who get the lump sums while these rappers bump gums?
The frame I drop is front page like a bus plunge
Tryin to put a little some some'n in the trust fund
and at the same time just have some fun
I wonder what'd happen if Maya and Koji Kondo
made a baby in the 80's that studied the rhyme flow
of KRS, then went off to college at the same time
played Final Fantasy and left 1-Up to 99
At the shows I get pounds and handshakes
I call 'em my family, you call 'em a fanbase
Ran makes music people can relate to
I looked in the mirror when I was young it told me stay true
Whack shows from Ran are like Nokia
No matter how hard you look, you won't see it
Cal Ripken of spittin, no days off
I can't afford to be missin
And alla y'all thugs with computers look foolish, we rule this
You kick-ass rappers are shoeless and just clueless
Lurkin in the forums just to see who responded
Constantly upping your posts so folks can comment
Man that's nonsense, scoff and I watch
When you do blow up reserve a spot on your jock
In the meanwhile gotta make 'em scream loud
Critics I have you like John Coffey, walkin +A Green Mile+
The Rock

[Chorus]

[Random]
In the name of the most magnificent, Ran rippin it
Antithesis of the whack, mad different
I come off like a toupee, touche
You DVD and I'm Blu-Ray, the new way, excuse me
I go in like a Jordan fadeaway
Yeah I'm direct deposit and payday's a day away
You can pretend to be ahead of me mentally
but the penalty is death or a similar injury
I don't spit them kiddie rhymes, claimin that they killin time
How they really grind, shut up and gimme mine
My level of skills ahead of the field
I raised the bar in oh-SIX now competitors kneel
No swears I ain't tryin to go there
Battlin Ran is walkin on a treadmill, you ain't goin nowhere
And no there, is no one testin this
So go 'head, take a razor to your necks and wrists
and kill yourself

[Chorus]

[Random]
Aiyyo, I don't brag a lot yo, but the raps is hot
So, I'ma lap the flock heh, while these rappers watch
Feel free to hit me up if the track is hot
This year alone sold more hooks than bait and tackle shops
And no additives like grandma's recipes
Heavenly that will be measurin me for they effigies
Sayin it isn't dope? Then you ain't listen close
College professors put my biggest quotes on sticky notes
They used to clutch they purses when I walked by
Now they smile when I stunt like +The Fall Guy+
Me of all guys, I dig in the archives
Spit a verse, split the game up like apartheid
Hard to think about kids with my persona
I could birth the next Obama or Jeffrey Dahmer
Bowlin for dollars, better stay in your lane
Cause we all from the gutter and they ain't playin no games
So we strike late night when nobody is there
Split shifts so nobody is spared, then we outta here
Yeah, knew you wasn't 'sposed to touch it
Me and Hexsagon, now we 'bout to blow the budget
