[Fes Taylor]
Yo, misery and pain, if I put a bullet in my brain
Will the world remember me the same
Would the game even acknowledg I'm gone
Or will they treat me like some fake friends when dollars is gone
I'm having thoughts of swallowing pills
Perscription bottles is filled, laying in the hospital, still
Have dreams of standing on the roof ledge, and I don't really care
What who said, I'm better off dead
Ropes hanging from the ceiling, coat hangers, so you won't hear me squeeling
I'm just explaining how I'm feeling
Already going to hell, for the way that I live
Plus it's a sin for the way that I die
Lord for what I'm bout to do, you probably never forgive
But tell the world that I'm saying goodbye
If this the last thing I ever write
I sacrifice my own soul, just so my son could live a better life
Even Christ gave his life for you
I'm thinking like this the only thing left right to do
Nobody probably show up to my funeral
Word straight out my aunt's mouth; 'you the let the streets ruin you'
I just want the brain and stop...
Don't let my child grow up, be the same as his pops
I use my last breathe of oxygen, just to recite this
Neighborhood gossiping, how I sliced my wrist
Son it's too much to bare, cuz they ain't really care
When I was there, I'll see if they miss me, when I ain't here

[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
Too close to the ledge, jump, jump
Too close to the ledge, jump, jump
Too close to the ledge, jump, jump
I'm hollering out; 'is this what you want?'

[Fes Taylor]
I'm like, S.I.C., front cover of the CD
I know my brother's above us, be happy when they see me
They say I'm going to hell, oh well
I've been, living in hell, since I cracked out the shell
Is this the end, something like New Edition
Don't call it suicide, this is like a crucifiction</pre>
