[Ceschi]
Next time I see you you'll be
A different person maybe
But gray hair wrapping your face
Won't hide change between those legs
Did it feel good, when he touched the creases of your sides
When he poked your ribs, and laughed, as he took another beath and smacked
His bony body against yours, under the covers
How could they not have the rotten smell of bodily pleasure
And for a second did you ever stop to think
That I was feeling all of it because I knew it was happening

I never wanna hear you cry again, my sweetest friend
But I don't want another nightmare quite like this either so I am leaving
I don't wanna hear you cry again, my sweetest friend
But I can't live another day like this so I am leaving

Did you feel guilty the next morning when you saw my missed call
Did your heart just stop, or did you brush it off
Was it so easy for you to forget
the single most important person you once had in your life?
Or was it just another mundane day at the job
that felt the same after your painful spite?
What about the nights that we spent talking, about our futures together
Or the nights when you told me that you could love no other
What about the California nights when our bodies fit perfectly
And nothing could come between, as you can see
I never believed, that you severed our dreams
Just for the sake of adolescent stupidity
Really was it worth it? To be physically hurt and alone
I'll never forgive you little girl

I never wanna hear you cry again, my sweetest friend
But I don't want another nightmare quite like this either so I am leaving
I don't wanna hear you cry again, my sweetest friend
But I can't bare to live a life like this so I am leaving
I don't wanna hear you cry again, my sweetest friend {*3X*}
