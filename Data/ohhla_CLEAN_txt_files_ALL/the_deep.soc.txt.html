CHORUS [D-Shade &amp; Revolution]
Watch how you climb 'cause life's angles are steep
The body's on the surface, and the mind is in the deep
Watch how you climb 'cause life's angles are steep
The body's on the surface, and the mind is in the deep

[D-Shade]
The last time I examined heads and necks were having spasms
They were reacting to the actions and the fathoms
That the, crews that deliver the new to your doormat
The D and the Revolu don't try to give(?) like John Cusack
Open your mental vehicles, you're getting boarded
We punch in the co-ordinates, and now we're ready to orbit
3-60 degrees around the planet
Making circles of MCs start to scream like Mike and Janet (heeeeeeeee)
Not only I, but crews be creeping in the deep
That's why when they around I'm always hesitant to speak to
See I, do what I gotta to get sunlight down under
Ground shaking down all them clowns that try to clutter (clutter)
Your mind with weak rhymes, got nerves to talk about mine
The creeps will know the diff between the good and wack rhymes
MCs with the skills be keeping it real in Mont Real
And critics keep it tight lip, that's all part of the deal

CHORUS

[Revolution]
Deep penetration, wack crew in-filtration
Putting them in traction for their biting infractions
I crush, skulls manipulate and reform
I take you late and inform, MCs how not to dis me
Deep, thrust to trust me in a whole kid
Coming from the land of Tut, you're in a bad rut
Depths unknown to man I'm under hell
You can't understand without the use of a Vulcan mind melt
I've lost my marbles on the verge of psychosis
I'm leaving en-tire crews with broken noses
The flow is like Crimson Tide when it hits your T-shirt
So deep I'm like a submarine, soon you'll need an expert
The setting, you're jetting (jetting) and you don't know where you're
heading
Well I'm betting you're bed wetting, and face is start reddening
Don't be embarassed because you're careless
Peep this we're fearless, to raise levels of awareness

   "I get deeper and deeper"
