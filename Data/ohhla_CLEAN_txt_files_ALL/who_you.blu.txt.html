Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[starts at 6:03 mark of "Liberated"]

[Chorus: Blueprint]
Hold up, who you talkin to?  I don't like your fuckin attitude
Who you talkin to?  I don't like your fuckin attitude
Who you talkin to?  I don't like your fuckin attitude
Hold up man, who you talkin to?

[Blueprint]
I aim for the stars, with the focus of a marksmen
And found out the hard way success is a moving target
For most artists it's so hard to hit
And so easy to quit, at the first sign of hardship
But hardship only increases how hard I spit
Respect's hard to earn, money's hard to get
I'm at the school of hard knocks with no scholarship
So everything I got I gotta work hard for it
From props and respects down to dollars and cents
I never been a product of put-ons or politics
Or caught up in drama and a bunch of conflicts
Ask me about other people's beef - no comment
I got enough problems of my own to deal with
To diss the next man's music cause I don't feel it?  Shit
Open your eyes man it's common sense
If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense/cents

[Chorus]

[Blueprint]
The rap game's off the chain, it reminds me of streetball
No playbooks, no referees makin calls
Nobody plays D, everybody wants to score
Pass the ball away you won't see it any more
You got a plan, me too, let's build this team
Pool our resources and make this cream
You got dreams, so do I dog, we ain't that different
What seperates us is how we go about tryin to get it
I don't care how you get, if it's workin them I'm with it
I've never been too proud to listen
The bottom line is I gotta respect your approach
Especially if what you doin is gettin results
I'm sick of feelin like I'm standin still blowin smoke
Arguin with a bunch of dudes that's all broke
Or battlin cats that want the same thing
Too proud to admit we're on the same team
Open your eyes man it's common sense
If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense/cents
Again, this is common sense
If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense/cents
