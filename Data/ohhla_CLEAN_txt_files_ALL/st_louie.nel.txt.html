(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Mmmmm you can find me in St. Louie
Where the gun play ring all day (nanana)
Some got jobs and some sell yea'
Others just smoke and fuck all day

I'm from the home of Red Fox, Ced the Entertainer
Jettin off with Brian Cox, I'll see ya later
Maybe not cuz I got somethin hot
In the Navigator, waitin in the parkin lot
A Bad Boy, on a Ryde Ruff-er than The LOX
I keep 'em both cocked, nina and sabrina
Now tell me boys have ya seen her
Have you seen her, nine millimeter
Makin niggas believas
Hop out the two seater, in a Vokal wife beater
Levi's fresh from the cleaners
Heavy starch with the cuff
Like fuck it leave it to beaver
Catch me in the Galleria, Plaza of Chesterfield
Rollin down Hanley Hills, in a black Sedan Deville
I used to love it when hit me for a rocker
Maybe a bopper, I kept it proper
A non-stopper, around the clock-a
Now it's cool to pull up the Benz and helicopta, uh

Chorus

Sunday mornin, crack of dawnn and I'm yawnin
Natural bridge and kings highway is where I'm goin
Wake up man and start blowin
Gotta get those juices flowin
Now I'm gonna tell ya one more time
For you cats that just ain't knowin
Hey, you can find me in St. Louie
In the hole with me Fetty and Leezy gettin swoll
Grabbin the Optimo, sharpin up my flow
Practicin for my shows, that's usually how it goes
We be ready to go, the chronic already rolled
Swingin through O'Fallon Sounds, knockin out of control
Like a boom boom boom, who is it? It's Jackie Frost
The one who's gettin where he at and he showed you who was the boss
I'm like a human hot sauce
Thinkin I'll burn your thoughts
Your information was false
I'll show you just what it costs
In the M I crooked letter crooked letter O U R I
No one could do it better, hey

Chorus

Now in the middle we keep it crunk and jiggy
Love 'Pac and Biggie
The way that you love your sticky
Call Louie he have you pissy
Mix with hen and crissy
Bumpin Tim and Missy
With Slim he used to diss me
In the red Expedishy
Thats Okay though, she can ride for the day though
Can't even be a house guest Kato
I'm a dog I said it rough
Now call me snoopy
Wouldn't have me in a hoopie
Now you see me in a coupie
In front of utopia, I'm hopin ya
Come down herd chippin, may I'm toastin ya
Thanksgiving in these parts yo we roastin ya
And when the heat come down
Get ghostin ya (god bless us)
Loax with us, just how he jokes with us
My daddy told me that I'm supposed to bust
Don't be provokin us
It ain't no joke in us
Just the North, South, East, West coast, and us

Chorus repeat until end (with talking)</pre>
