[Chorus]
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year I'm always here

[Verse 1: Sol]
You bet your lives on whether Doctor still tries to piece my head together
Cause I came I'm fuckin out my shit
Because Halloween comes everyday of the year for me
Too bad its only one for you G
Now the world invited put you all on twilight
Try to fight it end up on death valley nothings like it
Its just darkness every day's hallows eve
Its every time you go to sleep every time you breathe
Ain't no sun cause we're on the other side
Take a ride in Sol's mind beware a sun it makes you blind
Only if you choose to flow on wicked trails
Everyday all day my birthday the 31st of Hallows day
So that means I'm born 365 days a year
Except for Leap Year thats when I disappear
You can't find me you won't find me
Ask my doctor for prescribed medication and they declined me

[Chorus]
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year I'm always here

It occurred to me that I never celebrated Halloween before

[Verse 2: Skrapz]
Take a step into my home disregardin the smell rottin
Fuckin pumpkins on my window sill
No need for masks these days I've outgrown the costume part of it
Ran out of ideas cause all the good ones be so hard to get
Instead I just be Skrapz like year round
Halloween be my state of mind state of thought state of sound
Look around if your down with Halfbreed then you'll feel me
Keep me from the psycho ward cause all they'll do is kill me
And fill me up with all these thoughts that I'm a lunatic
But me and Sol ain't new to this y'all bumpin it is provin this
The wicked shit that caused your ears to contract
Because the Virus steady comes with the intend to attack
I look back into the times when the season was the cause
Now the cause is like an annual Hallow without a pause
I applaud the 31st and everyday that follows
Today is Halloween but I'll be trick or treating late tomorrow

[Chorus]
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year I'm always here

Its Halloween, I guess everyone is entitled to one good scare. I've had my share

[Verse 3: Sol]
The population they stay on me suckers strokin
Non believers tie you up and overdose on shit with Ibuprofen
Cause you won't let your brain conceive
That Halloween is everyday for me so I'm a let you see
And teach you the words, sayin halloween occurs
Every day for the half silent stowaways
And for the other half speakin this theme
Tell them all to go to hell and fuck they halloween

[Chorus]
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year I'm always here

[Verse 4: Skrapz]
I hold now sorrow for the victims I spread
They should have came with all the rest of us now they half dead
Waitin for the world to catch us creepin through they screen
Since I came onto this earth everyday's been Halloween
Like I'm livin in Haddonfield next to Judith Meyers
Detroit is like a battle field Devil's night fires
I been settin for a while cause it runs in my blood
I'm a product of the night and I bleeds no love

[Chorus]
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year (Fuck Halloween!)
I don't know why y'all think Halloween only comes once a year I'm always here
