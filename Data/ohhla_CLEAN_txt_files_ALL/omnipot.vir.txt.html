[Talking]
Yeh, Virtuoso, Snipe 4-20
We omnipotent yo

[Hook]
Intelligence is irrelevant to success
When disrespectful intellectuals get blasted in the chest
Depressed violent challenged constantly under arrest
Best be determined crime minds burnin' for a higher learnin'

[Verse 1]
My lips tremble as I remember cerebral violence of my livest
Sicilian sniper, the karma starin' in his iris
His slanted eye and higness was a warrior like Cirus
Through pokin' his sinus that made him mindless
Now blindness he's livin' in
He started pushin' in pussy that's lethal
A chick that's stickin' in infected needles
And she tryna boast, he had an overdose he's comatose
Bitch stuck a fist in his throat that made him choke
Almost to late but he lived to regurgitate the weight
I got a call at eight, a.m. tellin' me to meet him
In front of the mansion where we standin' lightin' a cannon
In the Pele pel, he took a puff and told a tale
But I was weak in the knees, traded his gold medallion
just to ride inside the saddle of cocaine the white stallion
Pull out the car keys, pop in a CD, and pulled a U-wee
We peelin' out to meet the rest of the crew
Out in a Montera sky blue fat body razzy ridin' shotty
drinkin' knotty headed for a college party
We puffin' skunk gettin' drunk while the beats bump
Then peeped a cracked out bitch lampin' wid her eyes sunk
up in the sockets, winkin' at the snitch shook her tits
Took a grip on his collar, and bit him like a rottweiler
Rolled up a hundred dollar, and then devoured white powder
Tension's holdin' tight up on his amaretto sour
He's shakin' like a coward over flour
He broke down, makin' the sniffin' coke sound
Now he's out on the town, on the corner beggin' for change
Estranged from his friends, he coulda pushed a Benz
He was a drug dealin' genius wid a seamless plot
But couldn't stop, the kid was a slave to his habit
Coulda had it all, but all his cream an' plays are shot
Because persistence will prevail where raw genius will not

[Hook]
Intelligence is irrelevant to success
When disrespectful intellectuals get blasted in the chest
Depressed violent challenged constantly under arrest
Best be determined crime minds find desire burnin'

[Verse 2]
My man Snipe rough life, in the moonlight
Can't sleep at night knife chop wife rock light
in crack pipe at night juvenile delink in the precint
buddah stink, eyes chinked red while the judge think
Wid Sicily shaped link, neglected youth, physical abuse
Had a weight lifting step-father whip him
Plus a mom stranglin', for hangin' with the wrong crew
Twenty two sippin' blood hittin' coke flippin'
Takin' SAT's on LSD, his university
Was assisted financially by slangin' kis
Split personalities, mind operates in intricate patterns
Manic depression opens the dome like the rays of Saturn
Now he's thrown outta home alone
His parents cool he's fuckin' up in school
His tool is a dutch master ooh, laced thirty and mean
Is pumpin' through the fiend's bloodstream like Valvoline
Leg splittin' lickin' women in silk and linen
That slanted out sex and exercise thighs like Richard Simmons
Without protection on a rock hard erection
Blessed wid luck he fucked and escaped without infection
In the school halls, fist pattin' a punk bitch until he falls
Is nose is broke the rules are broke so grab the stashed coke
He's expelled his nose clean livin' at Will's
But still seein' triple beam cream winner for teams
Love of life ?osteospamani? a mommy and a fiance
She's a soon to be wife, so fuck a crack pipe
Determination, for makin' higher education
Instead of facin' twenty five to life type incarceration
Makin' cash illegal, connects the faculties
Found the calories with salaries dealin' to rich people
Starvin' like a third world nation feelin' naked
Now we're money makin' master determination and patience so

[Hook]
Intelligence is irrelevant to success
When disrespectful intellectuals get blasted in the chest

Best be determined crime minds burnin' for a higher learnin'

[Verse 3]
The streetsweeper, I check the time on a black beeper
My crew roll deep with dutchmaster hash and reefer
My feet are greased right, life is a ego-centrical
Ecosystem where we're all governmental victims
Played like marionettes wid mental and physical threats
The only outlet for the scars of my brain and my pain
And to refrain from goin' insane as a soundset
Wet up the philly sparkin' solo in the Polo
Determined, to drink Bourbon, wearin' a black shirt and
Keepin' a fly girl and, a Chevrolet Suburban
For cash crimies'll break ya arms out the sockets
So fuck the Bank of Boston toss the shit up in the front pocket
Askin' a question that no one can ever answer
My mind is divine it's hard to find like the cure for cancer
Wisdom philanthropist, cannibis burnin'
When I'm blazin' up determination for a higher learnin'

[Hook]
Intelligence is irrelevant to success
