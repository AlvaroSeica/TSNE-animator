[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah~!! Heavy Metal Kings, BRRAP
Yo Bill whattup baby?
Yeah... BRRAP BRRAP BRRAP BRRAP BRRAP
Hahahahaha

[Vinnie Paz]
Y'all should stop rhymin
I'm a G, hard body, I am not common
This is destiny, it's not luck, it's not timin
And Vinnie stayin in the hood like he Top Ramen
I ain't ready for the stage until my fourth quart
I'm the definition of bully, a poor sport
However you want it we can do it on your court
My sword'll cut your shit in half like it's divorce court
I have G in my blood cause my pops had it
The straight left hits hard like it's Scott Travis
I don't fuck with anybody who is not Savage
The GSG-5 leave your block ravished
I'm not sick, I control the disease
I got llamas but not the ones that Napoleon feeds
Even the most protected soldier could bleed
Me and you ain't nothin alike, we a whole different breed

[Chorus: Ill Bill]
Yo, sawed-off or automatic, my aura cause static
Drawmatic anarchy volcanic is organic
Heavy metal emperors, kings on the planet
Bring whores and Xanax, think more satanic
Ex' pills, vicodins, OCs, powder
Haze, OG, kush, diesel, and sour
Dust, chews, loosies, turbans, and kufis
Handguns, rocket launchers, shotguns, and Uzis

[Ill Bill]
Imported Italian leather sofas Valencia, shooters imported from Chechnya
Put 'em underneath the dirt, with the rest of ya
The skull and crown on the sword, four pound on ya boy
cause entire crowds to applaud, ten thousand or more
Can never be contained, lyrically deranged, clinically insane
Critically acclaimed, I keep the industry afraid
They've been super nervous ever since we escaped, goons with burners
Destiny betrayed, refuse to lose or ever be a slave
A picture's worth a thousand words but a symbol is worth a thousand pictures
We never fully understood the symbols found in scriptures
Swastikas spraypainted on the pyramids
Sometimes I feel like we're just an experiment
Gold fronted up top to bottoms, cock the llamas
Mossad, Osama, jihad, Obama, call me the skullhead
Like Four Horsemen combined in one warhead
You fuck around I'll detonate and leave you all dead

[Chorus]</pre>
