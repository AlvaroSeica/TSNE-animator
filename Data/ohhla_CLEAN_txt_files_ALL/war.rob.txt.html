Song:   War
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

"War - WAR!!"
"War - WAR!!"

[Verse One: Rob Base]
This is a beginning, message I'm sending - out
To all the rappers who think they got clout
Maybe you do, maybe you don't
Wanna start a battle with me, but I won't
Cause it don't make sense to me, just to see
Who's the best you see
We got a lot of negativity, in the rap industry
Battling for superiority
Who's the best? Who's the worst?
Who's the good, who's the bad? I'm mad, listen up now!

[Chorus]
"War - WAR!! Huh, good God y'all" (C'mon now!)
"What is it good for?" (What?)
"Absolutely nothing!"
Say it again now (pump it up, pump it up, c'mon)
"War!  You MC's listen" (uhh)
"What is it good for? Absolutely nothing!" - yeah yeahh

[Verse Two: Rob Base]
This is secondary, tell me is it necessary
to battle another brother, hurry
Tell me the answer, I wanna know this
This ain't war, this is showbusi-ness
Unless, I guess
You think, you're the best, I won't 'fess
I'll make peace, even though I'm strong
Another flow right along in a battle

[Chorus] w/ different ad libs

[Verse Three: Rob Base]
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-let's talk about Hitler, a man with a sick mind
One of the threats of all mankind
He thought he was the best, the baddest
He's dead, and I'm the gladdest
A lot of rappers, they get egoes
Like kings and queens, and all my heroes
But no, I'm not claimin no titles
Young kids, rappers they idols
I'm not a gangster, I don't diss
A lot of rappers do and I'm pissed
Like Hitler, they wanna rule
But God's the ruler you fool!

[Chorus] w/ different ad libs

[Rob] Listen up now!

{*scratched lines: "MC's, brag and boast, try to play post"*}

[Chorus] w/ different ad libs

[Verse Four: Rob Base]
Now you're the best, the baddest, the roughest, the toughest
Man, you ain't sayin nothin
to me - cause I'm another MC
(Doin what?) Battlin for superiority
No!  That ain't true, I ain't you
And I ain't tryin to just knock you
I wanna get some peace and love and happiness
And things like those you can't miss
Stand your ground, I ain't saying be a punk
(Why not?) Cause if you do, your ship'll get sunk
Cause this is war - no, this is showbusi-ness
So let's get down to the bottom of this

[Chorus] w/ different ad libs

[Verse Five: Rob Base]
It's funny, I don't see Patti and Luther battlin
(Why?) It's doesn't matter and
All I wanna do, is make music
Throw it on so the people can use it
Rap is strong, word is bond, let's go on
Let the dream live on, we're movin
Like a jet - FAST
Remember they said it wouldn't last

[Chorus] w/ different ad libs

{*scratched lines: "MC's, brag and boast, try to play post"*}

[Chorus] w/ different ad libs - repeat 2.5X to sudden end</pre>
