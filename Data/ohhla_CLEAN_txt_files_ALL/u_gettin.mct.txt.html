(People, people)
(Get up)

(Cause it's party time)

[ VERSE 1: MC Twist ]
I need a microphone check 1-2, 1-2
Now b-boys and -girls, round up your crew
Cause this groove sure enough will hit
So do that dance just like a skit
Spread afar, now get face to face
And make sure there's a whole lotta space
Far enough so that y'all don't touch
Now yell it out (you get ill too much)
Too much to rock a party cause you wanna shake
And all eyes are on the moves you make
For that new dance that you happen to do
They wanna learn it so they can do it too
Now the party's packed and I'm collectin bills
And Boy Flash, he's on the wheels
And KJ's addin that funky touch
Yell it out (you get ill too much)

[ VERSE 2: MC Twist ]
It ain't a party unless you have fun
There's girls everywhere, so grab you one
Cause I'm lookin around until I see
A freak mama or a PYT
Cause if they stare right then and there
I'm makin my move cause I don't care
Never lettin go when she's in my clutch
Now yell it out (you get ill too much)
Too much ain't enough if you got control
So bounce, rock, skate or even roll
Keep movin and groovin until your body's hot
In other words, give it all you got
And when the party ends the posse spends
A little bit of time around the girlfriends
So all the females will stay in touch
And yell it out (you get ill too much)</pre>
