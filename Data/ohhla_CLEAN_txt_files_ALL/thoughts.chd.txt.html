Verse

Just sittin here at the dinner table
Eatin humble pie
Mind frame poverty trained
So much money in the world yet
Poverty remains problems improperly made
Property slain
Mother earth why do we smother her fuckin up my girls soil
America uses 1/4th of the worlds oil
Then they wanna go in Iraq for more
Yet when a nigga go strapped in store
You wanna say some shit you did the same shit
The greediest stealin from the neediest
The devious who's policin the police
Shit aint all good they stealin all the goods
Robin hood is robbin the hood fuck
Wealth all over
Fucked up health all over
Fuckin welts all over
The backs of those that built this country
Blacks are those people but called monkeys
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere
Be very aware pre-pare
For what
For the last call
And nigga I aint talkin alcohol
Get ya spirit right
today
(Be)fore you a goner and its too late
Death's around the corner like a nigga in a coma
Sleep is the cousin of death
And death is the husband of life
And you gone see him if you keep fuckin her
But we all sons of the sun might as well shine like one so
Be bright cuz
Be right-eous
Be right and just only fight if you must
Cuz what's worth havin is worth fightin for
Fuck you fightin for what ya life like
Nigga mines is real sign and sealed
Only thing left to do is deliver
Mic check 1 2 hear my deliver-y
Vocal booth turned into a labor room
Birthed from the madness
I see you over there in despair wit ya sadness
Replace that s
Wit a g-l and don't you dare keep it on the d-l
Share that wit erybody
Gone share that wit erybody

Hook

Bridge

Alright alright
C.h.a.d. the change
Change
the world
Lend a helpin hand man help a man
Who are you if you never helped anybody
Common sense aint common tho
Us is greater than I
Teamwork make dreams work
Mbutu brings true Uhuru
Uhuru Sasa
Freedom now
Even freedom aint free baby
Let us break the chains

Hook

All I wanna do is sit and talk to you (4x)
And share my thoughts witcha (3x)</pre>
