[Verse One]
Its the same shit feel like a nigga havin flashbacks
I might have crack in my ass crack
Back to that rubber handle, 38 special vandal
Play Godfather bitch,you get dead like Marlon Brando
These bars here harder than hard times
My flow make a lifer wanna stare at the sunshine
I'll bring a bitch you bring your bitch lets switch I'm a swinger
Hit ya face with a pillow case filled with mop wringers
Penitentiary style, big monster swag
Bitch I got so many tricks make me go in my bag
Yeah niggas keep sayin I'm back, It's a fact ya shaken 
Like ya ass got parkinsons relax 
Confused, acting like a white boy bored
Now you wanna jump a flight of stairs on a skateboard
Nigga!!! Why the fuck ya pants so tight?
You tryin to show niggas your ass your alternative life
I'm hungry, like I aint ate I lost weight
On a highway It's worth more, out of  state 
I'm raw, like Cypress I could just kill a man
Blow from Mexico's cartels pure kilograms

[Chorus]
Hate it or love it, they love me then hate me then love me again
Bitch I don't pretend pussy I aint your friend
I done told you over and over again
You can hate it or love it, hate it or love it
They love me then hate me then love me again
Bitch I don't pretend pussy I aint your friend
I done told you over and over again
You can hate it or love it, hate it or love it

[Verse Two]
I wore green, emeralds and my watch face drippin
Nigga ain't no safe safe when I start trippin
I might call my next LP Death of the weirdo
I'm high check my altitude I'm loungin in the Lear home
Feel a buzz a little Kool Aid and Codeine
I say gettin your ass whipped is a sure thing
It ain't safe in the water warm I'm playin my shark tank
On the trip to the mall to make your bitch ass plank
I done touched more pussy than maxipads
Now bring the Detox can be your little rap rehab
Bitch this a second visit from the repo man
And you can't afford your monthlys I mean God damn
Nigga you ain't worth the shoes you standing in
When I party I bring a bitch to bring the cannon in
You said you was gonna see me when your homey got shot
It's been a while so I'm guessin you must have forgot
Once again you forget, ain't this some shit
You forgot about me bitch I wrote yo' hits
You know How We Do,  Hate It Or Love It and nigga Fuck It I'm Special
Thats why your ass say my verse

[Chorus]
Hate it or love it, they love me then hate me then love me again
Bitch I don't pretend pussy I aint your friend
I done told you over and over again
You can hate it or love it, hate it or love it
They love me then hate me then love me again
Bitch I don't pretend pussy I aint your friend
I done told you over and over again
You can hate it or love it, hate it or love it

[Outro]
YEAH!!! THIS FERRARI!!! F-50 NIGGA!!!!
YOU COULD HATE IT OR LOVE IT!!!
WHAT'S  UP! YOU SEE, SEE Y'ALL NIGGAS TRYIN TRY AND FRONT!!!
LIKE I AIN'T THAT NIGGA YOU MUST BE OUT YOUR MOTHERFUCKIN MIND!!!
