[Intro]
Where were you in 92? 
Where were you in 92?
Where were you in 92? 
Where were you in 92?
92? 92? 90-90-92?

[Hook - 2x's]
This is how we do it in the XR2
The boys look fine, stereos Alpine
20/20, Thunderbird, 12:09
Took a pill - good time, all the time

[Verse 1]
Brick Lane massive, we were like grime
Labyrinth, world dance, baggy time
High top fades, we're never paid
Rolled-up jeans, easy Lucozade
Versace jeans, shades, and chains
We roll in there like we're late!
DJ's, MC's, private raves
Keep it secret - light it, mate!

[Chorus - 9x's]
Whistle, whistle - Blow, blow!
Here we, here we - Go, go!

[Verse 2]
Some of them drink Heineken and some of them drink Bacardi
Some of them talk a lot of shit and act rowdy!
Some say people follow me, some say people is the key
When the music's got a beat, then that's what gets me!
 
[Bridge]
Some say... (sound effects)
Some of them... (sound effects)
Some say... (sounds effects)
Some of them... (sound effects)
When the music's got a beat, then that's what gets me!
Some people think we are stupid, but we are not!

[Verse 3]
XR2, 808
MP3, MC Eiht
XOX to MC5
MTV had ADD
NBC and BET
BBC is OAP
REM, KLF
IQ up the ICQ
CB4, CPT
BBD and ATL
PDD had BIG
NYC had RNB
OPP, YRB
TLC, SWV
Jodeci, XXX
I heart you, SL2
 
[Chorus - 3x's]
Whistle, whistle - Blow, blow!
Here we, here we - Go, go!</pre>
