Xzibit intro:
Yes yes. Ahh ahh. Bring it live
Yo it's the X to the Z from the Likwit Squad

Hook:
"One MC" "After" (x3)
"On the mic"- Souls Of Mischief

[Xzibit]
All that get money take money sound funny
So I stick to my own I can feel it in my bones
These clones and clowns ain't really down
Play the background westbound
Huntin' down pussy like a bloodhound
Plus I feel that no style is darker than mine
You can stick that into places where the sun don't shine
All you one hit wonders only in it for the spotlight
Spend half a million dollars still don't sound tight
Bring truth to the light
I write rhymes for the under
Blunt smokin' bottle crackin' all day slumber
Who wouldn't give a fuck if the world fell down
As long as I can twist a fat one and pass it around
Mr. X to the Z from the Likwit Crew
LA to Elviaire with my man EQ
Coming live and direct with your neck like this
Come home and smoke a spliff in the Benz with Swift
I stay fucked up

Hook

[Del]
Lyrically ingenious my flows are intravenous
Kids are squeamish 
When they attempt to refless 
I'm the Apex 
Shows get rocked half the words ?
Hold your glock your whole goal is props
You'll never get 'em
My rhythm just fluctuates 
You can't O.D. no matter how much you take
I rush your plates 
Crack your lenses clean like Benzene 
Cool like Menthol 
My shits the end all
Majorly gain your speed slow your role 
You lie and like Pinochio your nose will grow
Let's go
Underground compress co
Bust these jewels these diamonds out 
But still some of these niggas don't know what we rhymin' bout
Mine in doubt 
Traversing' the Earth like zombies 
And rocks your dirty laundry
Presented to the world as comedy
Del rips it honestly that's why the girls are found of me
And don't be squandering your little flow
You ain't got many 
You're fly spinning
We constitution 
You seek contribution from Del for usage 
Over these acoustics
I take time out for use of 
Harkus representing proof in you walkman
Lockin' competition out of studios
Everyday I live is like a musical 
Create my own score 
More funkier than Shaft on my musical path

Hook

[Casual]
They like "ooh. Don't say that."
When it's lay doe A dat Competition where they at?
I diss 'em
Steady at the rhythm 
Like a pilot I keep you silent
Through the turbulence words will get violent
Mega doses exposes is flagellant composes
All you get is roses on your grave you misbehave 
It's the brave courageous lyrically contagious
Spiritually engage with the psychedelic waves of
An Egyptian
We rips then
Cover the mic like the sun we eclipsin'
Cause no light shine through a flow like mine
Casual might ignite the mic for pastime
With one style older than the sundial
My elaborate connection of words is fun how
I display, dismay this way gettin' bissy
Crackers show off the top while I'm hittin' a J
My immaculate style attackin' with nouns and verbs 
for the wack it gets foul
Got a Full Metal Jacket off rhymes to press 
To manifest under pressure 
Past style a lyrical treasure
Never the less I get fresher
It's involital my biological make up composes of flesh and blows
Will dispose of all 
When they appear in my crystal ball 
I know you wish I fall
"Yes y'all"
