Song:   Get You High
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Let me get you high for the moment
Come and let me get you high for the moment
What I'm smoking, I'm up
Bet to get you high for the moment
Come and let me get you high for the moment
Roll up that
We on a cloud, we on a cloud
On a cloud, you ain't never been this high up
We on a cloud, we on a cloud
Oh, yeah, I know you feel it, got your eyes shut

Little nigga from west down, moved on to the west side
Ain't put me on a medical, that left coast, the best sight
My weed blew my girl yellow, we call that best bud
My chain and my throne is two reasons she got her legs wide
Cut your beaver is the reason she gonna leave you
I'm a fucking animal, don't you leave it up to beaver
Plus I'm fucking cannon ball, she go crazy when I eat her
See that brand going round and round, beat her
This OG that we rode got me Jackie Chan
No, the girl I came with look like she no Jackie Chan
Stunning so she kick it with me, bitch, I'm Jackie Chan
I got her open like the doors on a family van

I'm back down alumni just like a straight A student
They ain't stupid, every day they pay it to us
You ain't talking money? You sound like you're making music
I'm rolling that blue dream, I'm a make your girlfriend do it

Let me get you high for the moment
Come and let me get you high for the moment
What I'm smoking, I'm up
Bet to get you high for the moment
Come and let me get you high for the moment
Roll up that
We on a cloud, we on a cloud
On a cloud, you ain't never been this high up
We on a cloud, we on a cloud
Oh, yeah, I know you feel it, got your eyes shut

But soon as they open is gonna be a movie
Baby, I'm a keep on rolling
Police smoke got me saying Holey Moley
Go and get a cannon ray, and ash tray for the roaches
I started with a quarter, money move to a half
Now an oz, only think I ever grab
But the OG make yours look like grass
Got a couple long jaws, not a old school bear
Hold cold hat bags looking out for the cops
Windows up with the AC to the top
Better take it easy, might just cough your lungs out
Put a little hush in it, bout to have some fun

Let me get you high for the moment
I ain't got to show it, you can smell that is power
Come and get this blunt from me, don't wait till it's full 20
Sitting on a cloud, just don't look down

Let me get you high for the moment
Come and let me get you high for the moment
What I'm smoking, I'm up
Bet to get you high for the moment
Come and let me get you high for the moment
Roll up that
We on a cloud, we on a cloud
On a cloud, you ain't never been this high up
We on a cloud, we on a cloud
Oh, yeah, I made you feel it, got your eyes shut</pre>
