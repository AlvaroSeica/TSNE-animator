Album:  Hey Man... Smell My Finger
Song:   Martial Law (Original Version) *
Typed by: dy_face@hotmail.com

* Track #1; the other "Martial Law" is a remix

[Music from *The Flag Was Still There* fades out]
Nahh, oohhh, nanahh, nanahh ahhh..
..and the flag was still there, waving on while we dance..

[Intro]
Boosting the bass volume to a deaf range
Cracking a bottle of champagne, they exchanged lyrical
gratifications verbalizing the form of a toast

[Chorus]
It's gonna take Martial Law, curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law, we're used to funking after hours
It's gonna take Martial Law, curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law, we're used to funking after hours
Yeaaah whores, ain't nothing but a party

[Verse One: George Clinton]
Check, funk is dead is what they said
While sitting around cheating at pool.. smooth
Bags bagging and they weren't bragging to tell the truth
They were looking real cool
They were choked up tight in their white on white
Cocoa brown fronts were down
They wore candy striped ties hanging down to their flies
Sported gold dust crowns

[Chorus: X2]
It's gonna take Martial Law, curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law, we're used to funking after hours
[Verse Two: Unidentified Artist]
Before I shrivel up and die
Let me tell you a little story about the FBI
The CIA, LAPD of the USA
Ask them why I list them, talking about that system
Let us take a look and see what's up today
They're taking away the rights from people, that's wrong
What did King say: "Can't we get along?"
Beat down by the man whose check he paid
Stacey Koons was just a drop, in the bucket full of wicked cops
No fire hose could wash that blood away

[Break: P-Funk Sample]
Ca-chase the cat!! - Ca-chase the cat!!
we're used to funking after hours
Ca-chase the cat!! - Ca-chase the cat!!

[Chorus: X2]

[Verse Three: George Clinton]
It was the fifteenth frame of a straight pool game
And they all stood digging the play
With an idle shrug they suddenly dug
A strange cat moving their way
We was a medium build cat with a funny type hat
Looked about five years old, he wore a messed up vibe
He needed a shine, she shivered as if he was cold
Ahh.. but to all the other guys, they summized
The dude was a motherfucking flunky
But the well-trained eyes of how the mothership files
You could tell the sucker was funky
Homeboy grinned as a dude moved in, asking had they seen the doc
They said they hadn't seen him but heard he as fiending
He had went to the studio to cop
Ahh.. but if you got eyes copping size
I can cop the 'P' ~ I'm in the flow;
LPs, CDs, Cassettes and 8-tracks, all good to go
Ohh.. but you got to post bail, my man's wholesale
He's the only connect I know
Flash me some bread the brother said
Freeze here while I go score
Well I got the bread but I'm leary, he said
I'm playing with the big band you know
Homey had plans to burn the man, to take his money and blow
But then he hesitated, ahh.. cause he had underestimated
Now he's got to do the real show
Aww.. he said I can cop a piece on a small time lease
You don't have to put up no ends, find you a stump to fit your rump, I'll 
sure back in ten
Ahh.. but as the brother stepped off
Up crept another brother, yo, grab yourself a stick
Said the littel man I'm not a throw off, worse yet I'ma show-off
As he chalked and broke the balls with his dick
Running the three, the five, the seven and twelve
Blood said your mamma and the fifteen fell
With combinations of English and banking
He cued up to break rack three, yo, looking over his bridge
Past the ball to the figure near the wall
Stroking his stick, saying hold my thing while I go P

[Chorus: X2]

[Verse Four: George Clinton]
Taking the cue from the man in view
He followed him into out of sight
Where upon he paused or rather he stopped
Pressing the rewind then play on the beat box
The funk was a phoney, a fake and a fraud, bootleg copies to boot
Not funky with a P on it but funk with a three on it
Now comes the time to salute
He says here's to begging duplicating and bootlegging
Here's to the funk on which I'm high
The man made a pass, flashed a gold colored badge and said here's to I'm the FBI
Homeboy grinned as he said my friend
You want to make an example out of me
Cause I stole a little funk and I sold a little bunk funk
Some pervert rapes your daughter and goes free
The man said with a grin, that's not why you lose and I win
If you're ging to steal the funk, steal the motherfucking P!

[Hook: X2]
Ladda ladda ledda ladda ladda, ladda ladda ledda ladda ladda
Ladda ladda ledda ladda ladda, ladda ladda ledda ladda ladda

[Chorus: X2]

[Outro]
Martial Law!!
Used to funking after hours, Martial Law
Martial Law!!
Never missing a beat, yeah!
Ladda ladda ledda ladda ladda
Martial Law!!
Ladda ladda ledda ladda ladda
Awwwwwwww woooooowww, ladda ladda ledda ladda ladda
Whatever the party goes for, whatever it takes
Whatever the party goes for, whatever it takes
Whatever the party goes for, whatever it takes</pre>
