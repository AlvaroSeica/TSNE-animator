Song:   I Ain't Tryin' to Hear It
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Prodigal Sunn]
When you see me making it pop on the top
Yo, I ain't trying to hear it
Floating Pac in the drop
Yo, I ain't trying to hear it
And if you not, say you're nothing
I ain't trying to hear it
Yo, I ain't trying to hear it, yo I ain't trying to hear it

[Prodigal Sunn]
I'm like a young rebel Nelson Mandela, Pueblo, about my cheddar
Business endevour, evil cashing the bake cheddar
Ring like a Rockefeller, sold oil and diamond seller
I write a letter, recite a letter from mine, it's better
Introducing Sunzini, gleam with that black injector
Director, Inspectah, the track RZArectah
Recorded on tools, compress jewels, to cash at the Two
Rock the rest, what took the metal chest, double ooze
Sunzini's school of composed lyrics, they love to hear it
The young and the old spirit, my music atmospheric
It's more than the soul, in every store, so go get it
And when you see me, you ain't got it, I ain't trying to hear it

[Chorus]

[Prodigal Sunn]
It's none of ya business, asking when will the Sunn finish
Internal flame, in the game, I watch the rest diminish
Dressed and replinish in fine linen
Musical icon like John Lennon, Curtis Mayfield, I stay winning
Rolling that diesel grease, I master kush in between
The thing that stack cream, a young black American dream
Flooding the scene, beating the cheese, supreme being
No fake and funny, making money, blowing up the scene
Critically acclaimed, worldwide, they know the name
The Prodigal Sunn a/k/a Sunzini the Flame
The age general, fireman, herbs minerals
Don't disrespect Sunn, you get up in the funeral

[Chorus]

[Prodigal Sunn]
Peaches and Herb, Marvin Gaye and the Temptations
Like Young Champ from the '70's, born raised to listen
Hustled in the hood, playing cool jewels, glistening
Any fools who snitching, shots through they division
I do it with percision, moving, my decision
If you can't stand the heat, get the fuck out the kitchen
When grown folks walk and they speak, you need permission
I say what's real, you spill, with superstition
I'm on a mission, fill the seven positions
Mental physical fitness, weapon, be my witness</pre>
