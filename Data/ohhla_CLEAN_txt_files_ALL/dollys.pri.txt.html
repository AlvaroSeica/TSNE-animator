Coming back in 2080
Seemed to be exactly the right time for the superstar who was totally, completely crazy
The people of this age propelled Superstar to centre stage
She was all the rage, she always stayed on the front page
But this was not enough, she wanted more fame and more stuff
And she had a diabolical plan that was insane as fuck
So breathing on the vapor net, Superstar located a creepy baby she met
Who said her duplicant machine was the best you could get
I bet we could easily make ten thousand duplicants Superstar
It's the best money you ever spent

We will all see the folley, this evil lady's name was Dolly
Cloning was her hobby
She was from Sheeps Head Bay, and old time sector in the states of A
Running her duplicant machine, big boobs in her way
Princess and Dolly was desperates desperate for guest spots
Divising the best plots to rule the world full stop, bling bling dripping from their snot
So pop, in the end our Superstar popped
She was unstoppable, undroppable, uncoppable, untoppable
A mad rapper ripper, a ? tripper night kicker
Heavy hitter ball with a baller

But that's not how the stoy ends</pre>
