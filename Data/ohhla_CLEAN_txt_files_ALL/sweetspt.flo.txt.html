[Intro 2X: Jennifer Lopez]
Let's, hit the sweet spot away-way-way-way
I'm ready to go, I want candy tonight-night-night-night

[Flo Rida]
Yeah~! I wanna take you back to my spot
You can be the candy girl in my shop
We both know what we cravin why not?
Make tonight first class with no stops
Girl - you know, I run a love game
Never play Uno - you wanna leave?
Follow me to the two-do', rock your culo
Love it when you call me your papi chulo
I, got a thing for you
You got a thing for me
Heard she kissed the Milky Way
and bring to life your fantasies
And together ma let's go and make Kool-Aid
Touch it and make the seat split two ways
You're in love with that too girl, don't play
I'm just waiting to hear you say

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Let's, hit the sweet spot away-way-way-way
I'm ready to go, I want candy tonight-night-night-night
I gotta taste and I'm, hooked on you for life
My, oh my, hit the sweet spot tonight-night-night-night

[Flo Rida]
Yeah~! I wanna hit the spot that gets you hot
and makes you feel like everybody need to have it this week
Baby just a hit, just speak, I got your candy shorty
Come around give it to you that deep
Oooh, don't you get me started, hit the afterparty
All night you done ran into a freak
That'll take you home, make you moan, watch the throne
Lil' momma I'm the king of these beats
Gotta love it, girl you want it you can have it no question
Been a whole lot of rubbin and touchin
What you know about the candy I'm hustlin, musclin, talkin that Russian
Bring it back like baby who you rushin?
I feel ready, now my talk is sweet nothings
I'll be the first to give your body sweet justice
So pack your luggage and let's, let's

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida]
Feel your guilty pleasure, come and get it tonight
You gon' get it tonight (oh ah, oh ah)
Know what your body's craving baby, I'ma bring you to life
You gon' get it tonight (oh ah, oh ah)
Don't be shy, let me take you for a ride
Oh I, now what your body's craving baby, I'ma bring you to life
You gonn get it tonight (oh ah, oh ah)

[Chorus]</pre>
