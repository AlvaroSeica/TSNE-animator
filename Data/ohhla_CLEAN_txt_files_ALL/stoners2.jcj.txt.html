(Intro, Juicy J)
Follow me on Twitter at The Real Juicy J, ya know I'm sayin
Y'all know the business, man
Follow my nigga DJ Scream at DJ Scream, man ya know I'm sayin
Hood rich nigga, we in this bitch

(Verse 1, Juicy J)
Hold up mane-Hold up mane
Juicy J from tailored game
Roll that Phantom; Roll that dank
Free cologne; I know it stank
Light it up and hold a drank
Hit the club; Blowin bank
Say you is; But I know you ain't
Gettin money? No you ain't
Roll that Cali green in a Zig-Zag paper
Smokin on the back porch; Who the damn neighbors?
Lookin for a chick who just wanna have fun
Let her hit the joint and put love on her tongue
Inhale; Exhale
Go to jail? I'm postin bail
Blue Dream? I know it well
So much green, I'm growin sales
Ounces on ounces; My connect, he got the deal
And he give me nothing but that illest; Stoners night, forreal

(Hook, Wiz Khalifa)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
Hahaha (Even smoke)
You already know what it is man
Young trippy ass nigga.... (Even smoke, even smoke)

(Verse 2, Wiz Khalifa)
Young Wiz; People call me Young Wiz
Roll up twenty Zig-Zags outta one Zip
Nigga smoke Zags over blunts
Bet a blunt smoker smell what's in my bag, he gon' want a hit
Since a young nigga, I was gettin lit
Ridin in my black Bonneville, bumpin Three-6
Servin no seeds, nigga no sticks
Used to be the one rollin weed for my whole clique
Now I'm buyin weed on some grown shit
When I say grown, I'm talkin bout the man who grows it
Lookin at my ring; Look like I froze it
I'm smokin good in here, so err'body knows it

(Hook, Wiz Khalifa)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
Even smoke-Even smoke
Even smoke-Even smoke

(Verse 3, Juicy J)
I'm ridin with my top back, my bitch drunk; I'm smokin weed (You know it!)
I don't know if they forreal, but she got Double D's (Damn!)
Hand me two cups; You got a Double D (Yes sir!)
I don't put it on if it ain't double G (Ho!)
In the Rolls Royce; Chiefin on the trippy stick (Get high!)
I'm bout to transform; Take her home and give her dick (And fuck!)
Trippy-trippy mane; I'm a specialist (Yo doctor!)
If I let you hit the vape', then you a special chick (Trippy!)
Kif in the joint? I've been savin up (Yes sir!)
I'm bout to buy a jet; I've been savin up (Let's get it!)
All the money I've been touchin; I'm gettin paper cuts (Let's get it!)
Ever since I put the blunts down, I've been papered up

(Hook, Wiz Khalifa)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)
She roll the weed and she don't even smoke (Even smoke)</pre>
