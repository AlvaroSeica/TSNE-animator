(lil one)
Peek a boo look behind you
I told you I would find you now
Need I remind you I swore that I would find you now
Now here we are take a look up at the sky
It's pitch-black no stars time for you to die
Why is what you ask me?
But then I ask you, why are you a bitch motherfucka then I blast you
Send you far away to another land
Where the ghost give a toast to the dead man
Shoulda been knowing the way I be flowin the way I be steppin and wreckin
These fools that be trippin I gotta be deep
and I gotta be killin I gotta be feelin the feelin of murda
Will startup the first to get shot up and caught up in all of my bizz
No one ever wins cause you were the one
who was yappin and rappin about these sins
But no enemy could ever get ahead of me
You chose  to be where death went you tried to put that led in me
But you missed now you no longer exist
Here's a smoke full of death motherfucka take a hit

(chorus 2x)
any body due to go start a fire?
I don't give a fuck till I hear me the choir
Anybody due to go commit arson?
I don't give a fuck I'll start fires in you coffin

(gelo)
Load the shotgun turn down the lights keep your lips tight
This night start a little more than a fistfight
Ignite the earth with a curse with a curse of my wickedness
Fire in the sky burnin eyes of the witnesses
Let you live thrivin of your misery and pain
Meant to be a strain for the mentally insane
But you be deranged it was creepin through the brain
I'm the keeper of the fame grim reaper is the name
Man I'm takin as I'm steppin weapon
get in the back of the car that I'm drivin
Makin my way in the land of the fools never bruised only survivin
Stayin alive and healthy wealthy maybe crazy
all of the time all of the rhyme every line
Givven em' reasons to hollow the pine
Taken em' out I be bucken em' down
Never no doubt I ain't fucken around
Watchin em' shake in the bubbly ground
Hear me screamin under the sound
Bound me with the sicko's
Writing sickos in the midnight
Boss of the loss toss souls that ever did right

(chorus x2)</pre>
