[Verse One: Prince Poetry]
Here we go again with the funky intro
People approach me, knowin I'm the Prince Po-
-E-T-R, Y, yes and I am the first BATTER
Drop "Fudge Pudge" cause we knew it moves FLATTER
Kid Capri, plays beats like this
Once in a blue, so it's not hard for you to chew
So kick off your Timbs and your polo socks
Washin emcees up in lemon-scent Clorox
Skills, no question, I got plenty
If you want dope lyrics plus gimmicks stress gimme
Beats, equivalent to just something that I caaan.. -
Flow (Flow!) ONNNNNNN... (FLOW! FLOW! FLOW!)
Yeah! It's gettin breezy so kiddies'll keep ya coat on
When I, proceed to, rock a party
in the summer, somethin equivalent to a Mardi, Gras
Bikinis, panties, (bras)
Take off the wrapper, bite off the honeydip like if she was a Mars (ugh!)
Oops, upside ya dome
I don't answer the phone when I'm home not alone, on the bone
Leave your name and your number
and a brief message, at the end of the tone - BOOOP!
Oooooooooooh, and I like it!
Prince Poetry is a psych and a mic kick
But the whole wide world wanna hear
Straight from the Southside, to your ear
Rollin lyrics off the tip of my tongue (swing)
I swing (swing), I swang (swang), I swung (swung)
I chop to a free sugar, I don't come
But I'm not a pretty oriental specimen from
"Hong Kong Fooey, numba one supa guy"
A special shout to my man O.C. double E
Props gets not Pops but you got G
Not just future in the shot, but I don't hold a grudge
Cause everybody in the world likes Fudge Pudge
(There it is)
Fudge Pudge, Fudge Pudge
Everybody in the world likes Fudge Pudge
Fudge Pudge, Fudge Pudge
Everybody in the world likes Fudge
Fudge Pudge, Fudge Pudge
Everybody in the world likes Fudge Pudge
Fudge Pudge, Fudge Pudge
Everybody in the world likes Fudge

[Verse Two: Pharoahe Monch]
Pressure presssure pressure pressure pressure pressure cooker
I leave the party when I mass a lot of hookers
Slip and slide, I sling the sludge-y
Fudge-y [pudge] pudge-y, but never hold a grudge
Up against the wall, I caught you with the drugs
[The organism's on the jury] guess who's the judge
(YOU) I hit the hook HEAVY
Ready no chitter-chatter I figure since I'm bigger why pitter-patter
Prouncin on particular poets who persist to portray professional punks
...Pussy! Cat when I'm deckin you
Disrespectin you, clever whenever I select a new dialogue
One plus one get it together
Girls don't despair cause I'll be your "Fair Weather Friend," FRIEND
No I don't have a Benz and no I don't have an Infiniti
I figure the eight inches of (hmm..), will be the remedy
when I pull up to the bumper
Cause I'll be down to thump a girl like Heather Hunter
I tell you now you never hated (hated)
The triple X when it comes to sex is what I'm rated
I tell you know that I can give good love
Yes I'm the one you should love (tell us about it)
So don't try to diss Fudge Pudge
Cause it's al-right, with, me
Kick slick rhymes out of a mouth
Cause I'm tricky in a joust, plus I'm down with Mickey Mouse
C'mon everyone, lets flow to the rhythm of my tongue
To the rhythm of a drum
Emcees wanna battle but they can't get with the
Capital M-O-N-C-H on the mic I get swifter
Than the rest of them maybe even the best
Scorin one-oh-one on a poetical test
So um, eff you/F-U
D-G-H you stink-E-P-U-D-G-E

[Outro - ad libs to fade]
