Let's review!

[Verse One: Jean Grae]
Huh! Back here at square one, like I just did the home base run
Without winnin any bases though, all basic reasonin, out the window
Ron Browz shit, Erick Sermon style
Like I got kicked off a cloud Method Man ninety five
Rap references because you get them all
You even get that I should have said it was ninety four (Ninety Three)
Hard place when you wanna still rock to it
Even in my glass house steady throwin rocks to it
Oh! I never stopped feelin the love for ya
I just stopped bein the one for ya
I think.....too much
Overanalyzin everything, sucks
I'm over over dramatizin everything but
You never on the level I'm on unless were cuttin
Lustin we never argued when thrustin
But then, after all they just turn to dust 
Brother swear I never love another if this really worked out
But this is just like watchin fitness informercials from the couch
Ouch! I know, your lazy
You see he's scared to pick a partner that's crazy
Much less, work less, purpose less from a to z
'Cause I'm a alpha, bet it's hard to stay with me
Heart computations dude still occur though
You and me some Merlou, situation blurred so
Much I be thinkin that the shit could actually work again
It's even nice to have you back in my world as my friend
Hey! Sometimes I gotta say it's simply
Why? 'Cause sometimes things is simple
We make it complicated for the win B
'Cause otherwise we just be face with all the in words
Inner child, inner space, inner monologue
We exchange intercourse without a dialog
Introduce intimate ways to turn our fire off
To thinkin us succeed with sparks, light, higher, moth
Heh! Heh! I still adore you
You adore me theoretically
So now I got to shut the door on you
So I can found out who was next for me

[Bridge: Sample]
Repeat after me!

[Chorus: Jean Grae]
You and me and everyone we know
(That's) You and me and everyone we know
(That's) You and me and everyone we know
(That's) You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
(That's) You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
(That's) You and me and everyone we know
(Sing along with it) You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
(Ok) You and me and everyone we know
(You Know) You and me and everyone we know
(Ah) You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know

[Outro: Jean Grae]
'Cause you know, your not gonna find what your lookin for, stay searchin.......
It's you and me and everyone we know, you and me and everyone we know
It's you and me, everyone we know, uh huh
You and me and everyone we know, it's you and me and everyone we knooooow!
Hey! You, me, everyone we know, you and me and everyone we know</pre>
