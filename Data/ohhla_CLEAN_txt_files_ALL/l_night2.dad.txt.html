[Intro/Chorus: Dirty Money]
If I gave you everything, baby would you give it back
I'll give my all to you
If I gave my heart to you, baby would you give it back
Tell me what would you do

[Diddy]
Some nights you ain't never change
You want sunshine and the rain
You want everything, you want too much from me
Girl if I gave you everything
My mansion and my plane
And my name, you want too much from me
The way I love you girl, you should do the same
Some things never change, no more pain thank God you came girl
I'll give you my first, I'll give you my last
Never gotta ask, I'll do anything for you girl

[Chorus]

[Dirty Money]
Some nights you ain't never change
Think you could fix everything
But the diamond ring, that's not enough for me
Boy if I gave you everything, my mansion and my plane
Just stay the same, and that's enough for me yeah

[Diddy]
The way I love you girl, you should do the same
Some things never change, no more pain thank God you came girl
I'll give you my first, I'll give you my last
Never gotta ask, I'll do anything for you girl

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Dirty Money]
Whatever you needed, can't even believe it
Would you do that for me baby?
Cause of this I'm breathin, and my heart is beatin
I'll give you everything, that's what you want

[Diddy]
Yeah - check us out~!
It's easy to laugh, on white sands and plush yachts
In Citation 10's and what not
But what if we ain't never touched drops?
What if a nigga was on the bus stop?
All black shades black hat black fitted
But no black car would you still be committed?
... Would you still let me hit it?
Would you still ride if it was a Civic?
I'm just hopin you will stay
On your knees and still pray
I'm just sayin what I feel babe
So feel me in a real way

[Interlude] + [Chorus]</pre>
