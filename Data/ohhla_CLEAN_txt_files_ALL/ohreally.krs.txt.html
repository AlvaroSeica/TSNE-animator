Typed by: PDog1217@aol.com

[Intro - Talib Kweli] - w/ scratching &amp; KRS-One ad libs
Okay
Oh really?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh real-really? (come on)
Oh-oh-oh-oh really? (uh)
Oh, really, really, really?

[Chorus - Talib Kweli] - w/ ad libs
Oh really?
You think you murdered the track, you kill me
I-I-Impact like the back of the billy, club
Take it back to what rap really was
Make so much noise we could barely hear your buzz
That's why we got these rappers scared of us
These other emcees just don't compare to us
These other emcees just don't compare to us
These other emcees just don't compare to us

[Verse 1 - KRS-One]
KRS-One, Buckshot, we back again
Time for you rappers to take off the mask again
From one to ten, we pass the ten
Bumpin Dead Prez 'cause I'm an African
I'm Naughty by Nature, raunchy by nature
Forty by nature, y'all corny by nature
Meaning, all of y'all naturally whack
And I'm naturally dope like coke before crack
Oh really? I'm more like the weed in this rap
And these new jacks are more like the seeds in this rap
I don't need to react, I don't even need to reach for the gat
I can see how you speak and you act
You'll be layin in the ground in five days
If this was the 1700's, you'd be my slave
If this was 10,000 B.C., you'd be livin in my cave
I'm bringin new meaning to the term "I'm saved"
I'm like a mountain man, unshaved
Walk through ice and fire unscathed (ha)
I'm livin proof that you get better with your age (uh)
Hip-hop's a journal, I'm turnin the page (okay)
Yo Buckshot

[Verse 2 - Buckshot]
Everybody get the gauge
Don't play with me, I ain't a video game, I'm so serious
Put so many O's in your brain, you oblivious
To the fact, you old period
Who the asset and who the ass that, oh there he is (huh)
Neck full of high class diamonds
Wrist lookin like you made a trip to my Hymen
In the Coliseum, or Harlem, or Canal
You cop jewels by the penny weight? I go by the pound
Anyway, I go by the style, not by the sound
So when you cop my CD, you can go out of town
Go out of bounds, I'm blowin the whistle, referee BDP
Y'all know I'm official, y'all go on my tissue
Y'all niggaz are shitty, you get wiped out, lights out
You can't outwit me, outsmart me or outfit me, yeah, it's my gear
I got an arsenal with me, nigga it's my year (bloaw, yeah)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - Talib Kweli] - w/ scratching
These other emcees just don't-don't-don't-don't-don't compare to us (come on)
Don't-don't-don't-don't-don't-don't-don't-don't compare to us (never)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh really, really, really?
Uh, come on </pre>
