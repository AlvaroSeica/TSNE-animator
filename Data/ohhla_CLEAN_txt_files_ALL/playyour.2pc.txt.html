[Intro: Tupac]
I hope it can work out tonight, what's up boo?
I know we've been seeing each other for a long time and..
Ha ha ha, hoping tonight can be the night, yeah, that's right

[Verse One: Tupac]
Another shady mission, had enough of shady tricks
You're so suspicious like watching pictures in Hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, and play the stolen kisses
Blind, insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, that they planned for me
If I have kids; will I live to see them grow? though I don't know 
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I'll die alone, but yet and still I'm hoping
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven cause being here ain't living
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain 
The world is crazy, still look for a queen 
To plant seeds and have babies 
Maybe I'll be the one, or just maybe I'm lost 
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

[Chorus: JoJo] 2X
If you play your cards right; everything will be alright
If you play your cards right; tonight will be the night

[Verse Two: Big Syke]
I'm always in the mix, life is full of tricks I guess
I'm trying my best, nothing less, before I lay to rest
My quest in future I mourn like new born baby
Contestant is seldom into the world, is so crazy
My daddy raised me to be a man, to do the best I can
He said: you won't succeed in life without a plan
It's hard to take while people trait, within being hate
Can't wait, better change, before it's too late

[Verse Three: Mopreme Shakur]
They got me at the bottom of a deck, searching for my ace
I can't take too many chances, ain't much love in the place
Full of tormented soul, and it's written all in my face
Hollow inside, a crooked smile is only the trace
A mission slightly incomplete
Misconceptions of success and defeat
I roam in these dark streets alone
Searching for your homies, smoking til I'm gone
When I need someone, the kind to lay my burdens on

[Chorus]

[Verse Four: E.D.I Amen]
December thirty, in nineteen ninety fiend 
Yeah, my reincarnation steps in
Born into a world that don't love itself
Though the love is wealth
My little nigga listen close if you don't remember nothing else
Just remember the life, ain't nothing but a game, a gamble
And how you play your hand; but sure there's a lane
For Example; every time you're going to turn into a crossroad
Don't lost though, keep on bailing and let them cease on a floss mode

[Verse Five: Yaki Khadafi]
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams
It's all wrong, pop do wrong gone
And now it seems; I'm stranded on my own 
Abandoned here in a zone, to protect my throne
Proud like a king, Al Capone style
Lay no tracks on this grind, coped up with crack, I get rhymes
Living life as a Don, Guess Cortex; Louie Va-ton
With my future behind me
Living with these snakes that; here to blind me
One day I know my future is gonna find me, am I crying?

[Chorus]

[K-Ci]
I promise baby, everything will be alright, yeah
Alright oooh!, everything will be alright
AWWWWWWWW! yeah! if you play your cards right
OH! alriiiiiiiht, toniiiiight
It will be, it will be alright AWWWWWWWW! yeah!

[Tupac]
Aiy, check this out, if you be patient
And you take your time, and you finesse it
Nine times out of ten homeboy 
you gon' wake up with your breakfast in bed
But if you rush, with manhandling;
Your ass is just gone tonight 
Ha ha, just play your cards right 

[K-Ci]
AWWWWWWWW! Oh! baby, Oh! baby, yeah
HUH! everything is going to be alright
HUH! it's just me and you, it would be alright
Oh! yeah, everything is going to be...</pre>
