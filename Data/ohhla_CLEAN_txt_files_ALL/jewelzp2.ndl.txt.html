[Verse 1]
Since I was an infant/ from my momma's womb I was evicted
Screamed and hollered at the doctor but he wouldnt listen
Soon as he cut? the cord Legend had to rush the door
Where I landed? was different from where I was a month before
Belly button scarred B/ stole me some car keys
Evolving in a world where blood suckers and sharks be
Blood brothersll beef/ uncles and cousins are thieves
So we drown our pain in alcohol or puffing the trees
Using scapegoats even cussing our seeds
Mind control mental conditioning has you stuck? in the Ps
So I look up in the trees and watch the birds fly free
Spread my wings like them and now the world eyeing
Got medicine for your system give the world an IV
Pump shit into the water streams and fertilize the seas
Im me! So do you! Motherfucker!
And? if you have an issue screw you motherfucker!
Headstrong the baddest/ high echelon status
The cells in my brain made of Teflon fabric
From the struggle to the telly with that Revlon actress
Fucking her with Hezbollah/ Lebanon tactics Yea!
Steady stepping on bastards/ thinking otherwise is uncivilized
Your? head is on backwards

[Chorus]
Yo from every word I speak/ from the soul to where my third eye meets
We drop Jewels/ everybody grab a front row seats/ live and direct
Death to all who front on we/ we? drop Jewels

[Verse 2]
Thoughts that elicit change from making illicit change
Driving and switching lanes in clubs where? we solicit dames
Slugs that'll visit brains/ stopping ya blood from pumping
Brawls popping out of nowhere/ stopping the club from jumping
Hardbody action/ reaction to violence ways
While the television teaching us that violence pays
Through telepathy communicate in silent ways
We wilding and acting foul/ up in this day and? age
Gangstas and rappers change their names
Subsequently adopting personas/ eating Kabobs and Chawarmas
Fucking broads? in Ramadas living savage while politicians call us Macaca
Alcoholics drinking Vodka/ dime piece salivating over my erotic monster
Spit like melodic mobsters melancholic flow that got ya
You know my level's like no level that you ever seen
Devils wanna medal but can't? meddle with my special breed
And when the metal squeeze/ I'll divide the seven seas
Like Moses in the heavenly bible bet they'll remember me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Legend/ yo this time we giving back to all the little children
We mislead through this music and all the little gimmicks
All we wanted was some cheddar in front? of our face
Greed corrupts the mind like a fat ass in front of your face
A chosen few control this whole society
They fucked for our masters and our rights got sole propriety
But shit comes back around/ like Ferris wheels and carousels
So give me back my? merits or shit'll blow/ I swear it will</pre>
