Now who say Dog Boy only come 
in a reggae fashion?!
My Mom say "Never Judge a Book by 
It's Cover."
Turn the page to discover,
You got the reggae on one and 
the punk rock ragamuffin on the other,
Richter...!

You know it's time to leave my house, so I slid out the door,
Had this hole in my pocket so my sack hit the floor,
Now this ain't nothing new I've had these jeans for years,
Hopped into my bus and started banging the gears,
Took it on the redline then I slapped into,
Reached in-between my seats and I pulled out another brew,
But now I'm 5-0-2 it ain't the route for me,
So I grab some chicken littles from KFC,

I'ma go to Mickey D's get a burger with some cheese,
Discuss these plans how I'm flippin' these keys,
Capisce, a cuz a cuz you don't' know him,
I'll give it to my friend, know him, we spilt the door,
Back in the bus we puffs, kept rollin',
Scoot Dog Boy, Daddy X is holdin',
There go the potion look you're frozen,
Damn this bud's good

Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,
Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,
Forward The Plan,
Forward The Mission,
Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,

BUMP BUMP!!
You know how the sound flows,
BUMP BUMP!!
Yo it's like that you know,
BUMP BUMP!!
Babylon beware we got one microphone for the world to share!

I got a '85 caddy with the Clarion Amp,
With some 10's in the trunk for punks who wanna bump my shit,
Bang, rattle your chest and brain,
Frame by frame rearrange your shit,
Adjust your amps and your shit might hit,
Don't quit to the beat, the bass gets deeper,
Listen to the tones as they crush your speakers with the little thump,

Well yup I'm still drunk with the humps in the trunk,
You hear the Kottonmouth Kings yellin' out BUMP! BUMP!
I flew through a yellow then I ran a red,
Grabbed a bev saw a cop then hit the clutch and breath,
Knew I had to slow down so I smoked a bowl,
Picked up D-Loc and told him start to roll,
Freeway was packed so I paid the toll,
Four joints later my bus was fishbowled,

Jamaica island of the sounds
And all you ever hear is the bass and drum
I said the ?????????????
???????????????????
?????????????? ragamuffin
????????? wicked rhythm
??? ride through Jamacian countryside

When it come to music lord we love it
Any style we ???????????
Bump 2000 lord here we come again
First time around we rock all across the land

How's that sound with the tick and the bump,
I puff the skunk while I'm settin' off alarms,
EQ my Mid so my highs don't twitch,
I drop bombs while your sounds blown to shit,
I like to sip on my binger,
Ice water rips are cleaner,
Push the bowl down with my finger,
Then i snapped a load,
The bud i got is meaner,
Felony no misdemeanor,
Got a Beamer same as Zingers',
With the system full blown,

Daddy X, correct, Who'd You Expect?
The mans ???????? connect,
????????????,
X is for ecstasy,
Is that why the fucker's standing next to me,
Or is it because I'm a Kottonmouth King,
With pounds and pounds and pounds of Florida keif,
Naw no thang smoke ring coinsure,
You'll never find my bong water dirty like the sewer,
