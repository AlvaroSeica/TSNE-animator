[Verse 1]
I'm at the club thugged out, Tommy from head to toe
Smokin' on that green leaf, mackin' me hoe
Hangin' in the door, had to decide I'm real thuggish
Niggas be hatin' that shit cause they bitches, they love us
I'm grilled up across the top, representin' the South
Where ya quick to get broke off if ya runnin' ya mouth
It ain't no doubt about these killers, if ya call em' they comin'
Gun shots at all the hot spots keep niggas runnin'
I'm at the bar gettin' fucked up, sippin' on me some Hen
Tryin' to mack to this bitch with this dyke ass friend
I told that dyke ho "Why don't you carry yo punk ass on"
That bitch decided to say something smart and I knew it was on
I swat the ho out, the punk must have thought she was pimpin'
Here ths bitch come again with about seven, eight niggas
I told these tricks "I'm outside if you comin' with anna"
I poped the trunk and lit that bitch up like "The Star-Spangled Banner"

[Hook x2]
Cause see we buck up in this bitch
Fixin' to tear up some shit
Better call 5-0 if you wanna survive ho
Shit, it ain't no stoppin' once the units get poppin'
Spit rounds, into the ground is where them bodies be droppin'

[Verse 2]
I'm on the strip ridin' clean on a Saturday night
Street lights got me flickin' plus I keep my shit tight
Black Magic sprayed on the tires, my Vogues like jewels now
Drivin' them hoes crazy, they wanna come to me now
I'm by myself, ridin' solo with that yok in my lap
In this town you got niggas that jack for shit and get snapped
You can tell when you see em' they be more ready to scuffle
Tail lights out, no tags and they missin' a muffler
I drop the top and I'm lookin' in my rear-view mirror
I seen some niggas look like jackers comin' up from the rear
I put that yok in my back, I knew they wouldn't get far
One nigga met up with that unit and told me get out the car
I acted scared, put my hands up and I got out the ride
I waited good until his trick ass nigga got up inside
He tried to pull out, I bucked his ass twice in the head
Shot up they clicked and peeped em' twice to make sure they was dead

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I'm in the park with my niggas smokin' on Optimos
Drinkin' Moet, trippin' off these broke ass hoes
These suckers puttin' on a show tryin' to impress these bitches
Drivin' all outta control, bouncin' like they got switches
If they hit my shit, I'ma rip a hole in they ass
They let excitement from speedin' take control of they ass
Just as I said it, some nigga ran into me with his Chevy
I grabbed that fuckin' yok and told them bitches get ready
I jumped out and didn't ask questions
All you see was that fire jumpin' out that Smith-N-Wesson
I blowed his ass off and now it's time to bounce from the scene
Before I smashed off I hit another blunt from that green
I started smokin' like ain't nothin' happen
One thing about it, if it's drama then I'm cappin'
Don't play no games, if you do you might get sprayed quick
Fuckin' aroun and I'm down with this gangsta shit
Get cho' wig split
