I-iiiiiiiiiii am worn-ohhohooohoohoOOOHOOHOHOHOHOWWOWOOHHH....

[Verse One]
Street child {?} in Moscow, in Russia
I'll rush ya, plans to pollute a city
My format pull four flat, like man holds in pitfalls
Pit bulls called through barks, blunts get sparked
To ease on down the tension, headbangin
box, Bronx big Willie, Los like Angeles
Scandalous street slaves, dark Carlway Caves
is where my apartment lays; a project doors
ripped off the hinges, mommy dearest arrested
in a drug bust, toilet sky flush
crack head lust - down the drain
Greenback's a must, thought I gotta maintain
in this hot land, I stand alone as a man
Who cares who hearts cries, took over drug spots where dad died
Pass the .45....to the death, lye...

[Chorus]
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on and let me stand
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on and let me staaaand...
Let me staaaaaand...

[Verse Two]
It's to 'til death kid, my heart beats strong for riches
Tryna keep it sane as I play the world's game
It's the, last year of my high school affairs
Sometimes I look back in tears, for all the years
it took to clear; but anyway plans is made
I gotsta blow up and fast, like the bomb in a sixth train blast
that's how bad I fiend, cash is on my mind kid
I wanna live my whole life reclined
Makin phone calls from cellulars, payin car notes to boats
Sittin back while I sip on floats, as I work the network
That's how I want my days to pass and times to last
So I meditate on which way I'll take, which door should I choose
or which path will lead me to a pock' fulla jewels; fools can only miss it
But yo I grip it to the DEATH when I get it

[Chorus]</pre>
