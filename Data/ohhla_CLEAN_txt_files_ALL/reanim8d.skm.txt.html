[1st Verse]
God is an atheist and Satan is a business, so I'm all in it
Till the stocks plummet and the zombie armies start marchin'
I'll be stompin' on your coffin in a pair of Kangaroos
Bouncin' backwards in circles, RE+animated Cannibal
Prehistoric manimal, you are Pterodactyl food
When I drop this fly shit, they'll see that you are not the dude
Just  a flash in a pan, I stashed in a can,
How the hell they gon' find a dead invisible man
In a mist of smoke blacker than death, I spit doper than crystal meth
Stomped the shit out your rep and never missed a step
With all disrespect, fuck you, what do
you simple-minded muthafuckers really think I'm up to?
I'm 'bout to show you a suicidal mastermind's last design
To add a splash of color to the canvas in your frame of mind
'Cause it's empty, watch me fill it in. Listen friend
Open your ears and let the villain in
'Cause he gon' kill again, with or without a pen
I parked my ship over China and then I jettisoned
Out the escape pod, I'm not a Earth citizen
I'm from the Federation and I wanna bring your planet in!

[Chorus]
You think you crazy bitch, I don't fuckin' believe it. I'ma need to see it
Talkin' like you want it when we all know you don't really need it
You can't see a lyricist, that'll show you what it is
Keep talkin' bout the south. I'ma show you what it is
You think you crazy bitch, I don't fuckin' believe it. I'ma need to see it
Talkin' like you want it when we all know you don't really need it
You can't see a lyricist, that'll show you what it is
Keep talkin' 'bout the south. Muhfucka' eat a dick!

[2nd Verse]
I need my medicine, horse tranqs, ten of them
Fuck Dr. Tenanbaumb, I'll kill all ten of him
Somebody call Dennis and tell him I'm on my shit again
I'm finna' murder the beat and eviscerate the witnesses
Why you wastin' emphasis on findin' demographics. If
they fuckin' widdit, they rockin' with you and there you fuckin' have it
It's simple mathematics. Graba number 2 and fill/ 
in the box of the motherfucker in front of you that thinks he's iller
But he ain't sicker than me and I ain't never gettin' better
Unless gravity take a day off, why would I ever let up?
The only way I'd lose my spot is for another level
better than the one I'm on. After that I'ma owe the Devil
And I'ma pay him in blood, lay in the mud
Wave my hands like Moses and move an ocean of blood
What, the fuck would ever make you think that you invincible?
Your fiction is mythical, this is beyond principle
Exempt from any category, killin' it is mandatory
When the angels come for me, I'll take another stab at glory
Feather by feather. Hell or Heaven whatever
I'll take when will SKAM2? fall off for a 100. The answer's NEVER!

[Chorus]
You think you crazy bitch, I don't fuckin' believe it. I'ma need to see it
Talkin' like you want it when we all know you don't really need it
You can't see a lyricist, that'll show you what it is
Keep talkin' bout the south. I'ma show you what it is
You think you crazy bitch, I don't fuckin' believe it. I'ma need to see it
Talkin' like you want it when we all know you don't really need it
You can't see a lyricist, that'll show you what it is
Keep talkin' 'bout the south. Muhfucka' eat a dick!</pre>
