[Intro]
{LISTEN TO THE TRACK, BITCH}
Get out my lane {*8X*}

[Gucci Mane]
I'm in the yellow thang, on the expressway
That bitch so nasty it might give a bitch road rage
Get out my lane - Ferrari Boyz
You see the chain - So Icey boys
I'm ridin in a mansion, but I don't think I'm fancy
But I cut the blinker on and my diamonds dancin
Once upon a time, a little while ago
There was a nigga in a 'rarri with a pretty yellow hoe
Got my head held up, cause I think I'm handsome
As the media portrayin me as Charles Manson
And I coulda bought a Phantom, road here four deeper
But I'd rather pull up solo in the yellow two-seater
Gucci~!

[Chorus 4X: Gucci Mane]
Get out my lane! Ferrari Boyz
You see the chain - So Icey boys

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Riding in the 'rarri same color as Bacardi
She don't like me shawty man she like my car
Damn near wanna fuck my chain, damn near wanna fuck my name
Wanna bust every nigga in the clique I claim
Deep-dish rims ain't no offsets mane
That's how me and Gucci Mane came
Iced out poppin shit, drunk switchin lanes
I rock bandanas like Santana, screamin out "Who want some anna?"
Made a million off my words, they in love with my country grammar
That's the antenna, cause these rap nigga careers got static in it
I'm a walkin meal ticket, just wait a minute
Bank account got commas in it, all black 'rarri know the llamas in it
I hear them talkin gangsta shit but I know they lame as hell
One thing I ain't gon' do, pussy nigga you scared of jail
My name ring bells, my engine loud as hell
Shit, my 'rarri cost about 230 bails

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 4X]
I'm just lane changin, chain swangin {*3X*}
{FERRARI BOYZ}

[Chorus]</pre>
