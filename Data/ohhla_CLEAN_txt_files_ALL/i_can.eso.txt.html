Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Children of the Sun
What's goin on?
This is Jehst, MC's is on the beat once again
For those that know - and those that don't
Bliss n Esoteric, Izm
Yeah, we keep it moving like this

I can do this, I can do that
I can make myself break out of the track
But thinking I can't do jack
Now the only thing I can't do is hold back
I can globe trot across the whole map
Rock a show, make the whole world soul clap
I can snap shots with my Kodak
Spiral the hydro blow back, machine gun funk
I can smoke a whole rainforest in a blunt
I can space travel when I got it in my lung
Clouds, step planets, spitting hotter than the sun
Faster than a bullet from a gun
With the logic of tongue, squashing beef before any killings done
I can chill on one, blood on a vibe
Talking to the earth mother
Now I'm on the other side
Stare God in the eye till my vision is blind
Cuz the sun is the God and the wisdom is the light

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

We can fly tons of steel through the sky as an airplane
Sh*t we can move mountains with our bare brains
Ambition is the call to fight for me
I don't have to join an army to be all that I can be
I can call it how I see, I can exercise free speech
I can walk the beach with the fresh sky sea breeze
I can track my path in the sand through my footprints
I can capture life's garden in a books ink
They pin us with the cruel thumb of fear
But I can see their game and the truths coming clear
I can feel the rain like cool summer tears
And I can come back in a few hundred years
Look at our track record, our favourite high achievers
The common thread is, I can all bright believers
I can hurdle every single obstacle
With training, man your optimal
And anything is possible

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

We can send people into space
And use laughter as medicine
And drop bombs behind the mask of a president
I can see through the lies of the government
I can hit rock bottom and then pick my self up again
I can free myself from being tied up in prison
I can go the distance
I can mindfuck the system
I can pick the lock
Crack the code, ship this off, stack the load
You can find me on a misty dock packing cones
But I'm high without the pleasures of a drug
And I can change my girls mood with a gesture of my love
I can master my courage to fight another day
I can bend that spoon that tried to run away
I can tame the rage of a cage full of primates
I can spit with Jehst
And put the H in the right place
So, I guess it's safe to say now
I can fall down the rabbit hole and make my way out

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

I can do this, I can do that
I can make the whole map react from where I be at

Tryin to move forward
Positive frame of mind</pre>
