[Kool G Rap]
Bitch, don't try to settle me down
I eat, sleep, fuck, skeet, gas-peddle around
Get out, meet up with kids that keep that metal around
We ain't pushing no gold medal, I don't meddle with clowns
Run a ten-thou' block a day, five Gs minimum
Tryna hop in some shit that got the double M emblem
Vest and a ratchet on me, jacket, black Timberlands
Bitch, cry if you want, I'ma live to stack Benjamins
Taught this nigga to stunt it, played him there in the street
Now his shorty blowing my dick out of fear of the beef
Tears on her cheek, don't ask me, I ain't gon' hurt her
But stay away from that lame ma, you know it's murder, murder
Them niggas on that other side is weak, they some burgers
Bump heads in the street, I put the heat to 'em, word up
All I need is some hooker stress, G keeps his hooks in check
Bitch, I should be in the V getting hook with neck
When I put bets on the negligee looking best
Hold on a minute, yeah yo, it's crooked neph'
Y'all niggas packing and ya acting like y'all shook to death
I'll be back bitch, my nigga just got jooks and wet
You let him find out, them niggas getting put to rest
5 Fam ride out, Queens borough, Brook' connect
Look at me, yeah I'm your typical nigga
And I'm out to get despicable figures
Picture me, G, baby ten years from now, picking their litter
Kids that ain't even know shit to consider
I'm just your typical nigga
Look at me, yeah I'm your typical nigga
And I'm out to get despicable figures
Picture me, G, ten years from now, picking their litter
Kids that ain't even know shit to consider
I'm just your typical nigga</pre>
