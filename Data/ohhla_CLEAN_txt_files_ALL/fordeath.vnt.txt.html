[Vents]
Yo, yo, you know the Era is Gold, my rhyme .357 revolve'
Heavy metal melt your brain cells, let 'em dissolve
I'm the germ from the swamp that evolved, turned ape to man
and bought a flat screen made in Japan
Make records that jam like automatic weapons
Rappers shit their pants like an organic breakfast
I'm genetically modified to slam
More lethal than white man when he colonised land
Like the civilised man gave the savage religion
They give 'em the gift of the factory system
Backbone of the fashion division
is little kids working sixteen hours with a talent for stitching
Mathematicians calculate time
Little hands, measured in milliseconds on the factory line
It's all for you, worked to the bone till they lie in the earth
Marked for death, right from birth

[Chorus]
"What's the deal, huh?" Everybody's marked for death
You can't run, can't hide "when you're marked for death"
I was born to grow old cause I'm marked for death
"So put a target on your head cause you're marked for death"
"What's the deal?" Man, woman, child "marked for death"
I'm on a one-way street straight "marked for death"
Lifetime tryna forget that I'm marked for death
"So put a target on your head cause you're marked for death"

[Vents]
Yo, we contaminate the planet, nature rapidly raped and battered
The world look better when it's paved in granite
Got a pack-a-day habit, pay less for the carbon
Give it to me straight-up doc, spare me the jargon
It's carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and arsenic
Hooks in my flesh deep, hard to kick
Intravenous, nurse pass the drip
I'm sicker than Star of David in the Gaza Strip
Got a sixteen bar banana clip
Rhyme style bizarre, latex mask and whip
Bloodshot, calm as shit, so pass the Temazepam
I'm cooler than a black man up in Arnhem Land
Half a gram up the beak every week, must refrain
Glassware touch the flame
Once again, crackheads starved for breath
Born to bleed and marked for death, motherfucker

[Chorus]

[Vents]
Yo, survivors of war for territory, they locked up or they dead at forty
Kevin Rudd said he's sorry, that's the end of story
First cop charged with the murder of an aboriginal man
got promoted and a hundred grand
Great southern land, home of the venomous pets
A bad motherfucker, Oedipus Rex
Like to vibe off terrorist threats
Like to blow your fucking mind with a verse, gosh, Heavens to Bets', yep
Don't want a woman that will be in the kitchen
I want a woman on the floor with me, foetal position
I've been begging and pleading for you people to listen
The cage is not locked, start leaving the prison
I understand that man has a need for religion
with nuclear bomb, pinpoint needle precision, listen
No god, no master left
Man, woman, child, marked for death, motherfucker

Yo, yo, the Funkoars, what up? "Put a target on your head"
Hilltop, you don't stop "Put a target on your head"
Adfu, what's the deal, huh? "Put a target on your head"
"Put a target on your head cause you're marked for death"</pre>
