Ya'll ready?

[Chorus]
When I wake up
First thing on my mind is get this cake up
Stayin on my grind and stackin straight up
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
When I wake up
First thing on my mind is get this cake up
Ain't no time to sleep I gotta stay up
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
We gon we gon we gon get dis money

Yeah
Thie early bird get the worm first
Sixteen, we was out there on that curb first
With a quarter tryina see who get a bird first
Like fuck a undercover cop we tryna see who gettin served first
Yeah we was dead wrong but we had to learn first
We ain't give a fuck whoever fronted us got burnt first
Yeah
We like we gon get this paper
My shooters was tryn kill I'm like we gon get em later
Tryna turn a dollar bill into a pretty situation
Just thinkin bout them benjis got a nigga in the matrix
Waitin
Losin patience my mind racin
Plus my seed growin so you know I need doughin

[Chorus]
When I wake up
First thing on my mind is get this cake up
Stayin on my grind and stackin straight up
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
When I wake up
First thing on my mind is get this cake up
Ain't no time to sleep I gotta stay up
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
We gon we gon we gon get dis money

Yo
I used to score my lil L
Thinkin bout my master plan
Tryna get a million fuckin dollars out of half a man
Cause bein broke got a nigga feelin like a half a man
We gon get this money though
We just in a traffic jam
(We gon get it)
And I wanna live the fast life
Fast cars fast bitches fast money fast bike
I was in the dark
Shit that money was like a flashlight
Cause I started shinin same day I got my stash right
(Same day)
Uh
This money ain't a joke
Niggas lookin like snakes
They was cool when I was broke
But now I'm gettin money
They lookin at me funny
That's what I get my heaters
Cause I ain't never been a sleeper

[Chorus]
When I wake up
First thing on my mind is get this cake up
Stayin on my grind and stackin straight up
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
When I wake up
First thing on my mind is get this cake up
Ain't no time to sleep I gotta stay up
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
We gon we gon we gon get dis money

Look
I'm a get rich or die tryin
If gettin money was sinnin
Fuck it I'm fryin
If I'm lyin I'm flyin
I'm buckin my eyein
If a nigga tryta take
I knock somethin out his face
I go in and out of state
Up and down 95
Just to get it for my niggas put my life on the line
They want what I got
They'll never get it from me (never)
But we gon get dis money

[Chorus]
When I wake up
First thing on my mind is get this cake up
Stayin on my grind and stackin straight up
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
When I wake up
First thing on my mind is get this cake up
Ain't no time to sleep I gotta stay up
We gon we gon we gon get dis money
We gon we gon we gon get dis money

My philly niggas (we gon we gon we gon get dis money)
My delaware niggas (we gon we gon we gon get dis money)
All my jersey niggas (we gon we gon we gon get dis money)
My new york niggas (we gon we gon we gon get dis money)
