[Childish Gambino]
You are the bestest, I will obey you
They wanna know what, I couldn't say who
You are the only one who's ever really seen me
I know that I'm the reason that you don't watch any TV
I wanna lay on your stomach so bad
And it gets a little quiet in this bachelor pad
And I don't really understand the thing we had
I wanna try again but it would just be sad
And ohhhhhhh, oh no!
You are the only one
who's ever let me be me

[Interlude]
We can make it easy, we can do it simple
I'll be waiting right there, promise to be gentle
Sittin by your window
Girl, you're so fly to me

[Chorus]
So fly, girl you're so fly
So fly, girl you're so fly
So fly, girl you're so fly to me
So fly, girl you're so fly
So fly, girl you're so fly
So fly, girl you're so fly to me

[Bridge] + [Chorus] </pre>
