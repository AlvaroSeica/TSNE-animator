Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Devil in my ear, I hear him whispering, kill em all, kill em all
Devil in my ear, I hear him whispering, whispering

Devil in my ear, I hear him whispering
So I ask the Lord to get rid of him
Keep him out my mind and out my heart, please
I'm praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies

What's the time on my audemar, fuck the time cause I can die tomorrow
Popping mollies like tylin all, waiting around for my final call
Niggas try to homicide me yo, get believe that my 9 are draw
East side it's the riders dog, if you ask what happened, I'll deny it all
Lord keep me from trigger squeezing, when I feel the reason
When it's killing season, when I feel the breeze
It means I'm shooting when the wind blow, long as all my enemies are breathing
3 am I'm in nail pc, and heard a nigga ruger bang, throwing shots at me
They coming right back, let's call that boomerang
I'm laying in my bed, last night just keeps playing in my head
Walked in the rest room to check my flash room
Thinking next time they gonna lay a nigga dead
Yeah crook they gonn steal your life, devil in my ear with the ill advice
He say kill em twice, I'm praying to God, while I'm holding on to my 3.80 for real

Devil in my ear, I hear him whispering
So I ask the Lord to get rid of him
Keep him out my mind and out my heart, please
I'm praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for you, hear that

No breakfast this morning, count up a million
No daddy for goddess, I make my decisions
I cop me a tars, one hustler's ambition
I stay on my grizzly, you was washing them dishes
I was chasing that money, you was chasing them bitches
While my mama was struggling, I provided it on with it
Know the lord be my witness, killer show no forgiveness
2 many these loyal niggas, that was just keep fucking with me
I'm paranoid, I'm sinning, no kind of love for bitches
Niggas I know be hating, I count my filthy riches
Pray for them hoes women, casket for guilty snitches
Pray for my enemies, the problem is my chopper dick

Devil in my ear, I hear him whispering
So I ask the Lord to get rid of him
Keep him out my mind and out my heart, please
I'm praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for you

Devil so close, heaven is so far, father forgive me I'm about to take them to war
Ready to ride, chopper loaded, hop out the course
Send em a couple rounds, I ain't come by the bar
Niggas want me dead, praying I wouldn't breathe
10 toes down, I told them I wouldn't be leaving
Soon as I hit the lights, somebody fin to be grieving
What's up that bitch? I told them I wouldn't leave it
All fuck niggas get dead or get gone, I send them at your head for the bridge to keep rolling
Ain't nobody to call, step with no phone, king of the streets
I've been dead for so long
Bitch I'm on the throne, I would never bow down
If you want beef, I was gonna jump down
Certified stiff, I would never fall down on my ass
Tell 'em I'll never come down
I pray somebody get my enemies out of reach, fuck a grave
I'm a put them in the sand on the beach
When the old school doors open up for affinities, no peace
You can tell them everything gets breached
I'm a headed side medal, stick it to them like a leech, check my stats bitch
I'm a cheeve like Leech
Tell 'em I'm in field but my turd like creeps
Running through anything like certified freaks

Devil in my ear, I hear him whispering
So I ask the Lord to get rid of him
Keep him out my mind and out my heart, please
I'm praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies

I can hear them whispers, cup full of hard liquor
Telling me to pick that clipper, making flame till I hick up
Lord on my right shoulder, devil on my left
Hearing voices in my head every time I take a step
He says, kill em all, grab the gun and kill em all
And if you do this deed then I'll lead you through the fog
The lord is in my other ear and this is what He say
My son if you follow him, you walk amongst the dead, pray

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Fear God and no man, I'm a man of respect
But I can kill like cancer, on my hands I destroy
I can gamble with your life, can you handle the debt?

Devil in my ear, I hear him whispering, whispering
So I ask the Lord to get rid of him
Keep him out my mind and out my heart, please
I'm praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies</pre>
