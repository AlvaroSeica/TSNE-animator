[Intro: Notorious B.I.G]
Check it, I grew up a fucking screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got an ounce and fucking blew up
Chopping rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls is trying to turn into the black Frank White

[Mav Neal] It's a red light!
[Stretch:] Running from the police
[Mav Neal] How many homies gotta die tonight?
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] Awww, yeah, stop the gunfight!
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] I can feel it, somebody's trying to start up a fight
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] Start up a fight!
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] Come on and peep game, oh oh!
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] But you cannot cease the blame
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] And if you ask me, it's a damn shame!
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] We be taking lives that we can't replace
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] Over B.S. that don't make sense
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] We got to get better than this
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] We started fighting at our own risk
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] It was something we couldn't resist
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] It's a red. ai ai ai.. light
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] How many homies gotta die tonight?
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] Awww, yeah!
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga..

[Notorious B.I.G.]
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show their toes, you know, they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets, and chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that, nigga, I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch an asthma attack (*heavy breathing*)
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he dropped, take his glock and I'm Swayze (YEAH!!)
Celebrate my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make

[Tupac]
Running from the five-oh
ducking and dodging in my survival
The Benzo and I let off with my nine, hoe
I'm moving swifter than the next nigga, no time for sex
Cause in my mind all I wonder is who's next
Nigga, my homey slipped and now he pays the price
He did a drive-by, sixteen, now he's doing triple life
Tell me is it me or my upbringing
I spit that thug shit, nigga motherfuck singing
I hope you got your Timberlands on tight
cause I ain't giving up;
I'd rather duck these motherfuckers all night
I'm running through the projects, beyotch
They'll never catch me
Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy on the.. sneotch
Don't say you never heard of me, 'til they murder me
I'm a legend; do Thug Niggaz go to heaven?
I'm rolling with the thorough heads
We're getting ghost on them whores and yo
I got no love for the five-oh, I'm running from..

[Stretch] 
The police, no matter what I do
They got a nigga running from the police

[Mav Neal] Stop the gunfight
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] I can feel it, somebody's trying to start up a fight
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] Come on and peep game, uh oh!
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] But you cannot cease the blame
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] And if you ask me, it's a damn shame!
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] We be taking lives that we can't replace
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] You got swishes in your system, juice up in you
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] Now you're red again, over what he said, over what she said
[Stretch:] No matter what I do, they got a nigga running from the police
[Mav Neal] Now somebody gotta end up dead</pre>
