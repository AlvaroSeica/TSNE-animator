To all my listners out there
This your boy, Kut Calhoun
And this song here, is about my life
It can be about your life
What people have to say about, won't let you live your life
Here's what I think

[Verse 1 Kutt Calhoun]
My pants is saggin' braided hair
People stare but I don't care
It's the life that I choose to lead
I'm who I choose to be
And who are you to be abusing me?
With your hypocritical, stereotypical slanders
"Oh! he's a thug he must sell drugs at random"
Just because I'm a young black brother I gotta slang dope
And disrespect black mothers, Nah!
I'm a king for a queen, on a quest to ball
I'm the spleen in a man, an threat to yo'll
I'm black, strapped and packed with intellect and all
I'm what you call your worst nightmare ????
Cause I don't walk around with a happy face
I got a face stressed, and feed mouths, I ain't livin' in Happy Days
So you can say what you wanna
I'ma still gonna be the same ol me in the mornin'
(know why?)

[Chorus]
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
Here's my chance to make you feel
What I feel
If it's real
Move on
And god bless the child that can hold his own

[Verse 2 Kutt Calhoun]
Now everybody got something to say
About who I be fuckin
The pills that I'm popin'
"Just tone it down okay"
Since everybody wanna open their mouths (Surprise)
I got a big dick for her
swallow this and get outta (My life)
Instill it in your head, and learn
It's just me!
I never cared to share concerns
About what y'all doin
Who yo'll hanging with
Who yo'll screwing
What your ill legit
Leave me alone
If I wanna bone, every grown woman in the city, then it's on!
You ain't gon' stop it, I'm a grown ass man
Doing mine with the excasty, I'm still gon' pop it
(let a nigga live)
Or give a nigga room
Got a complicated life that's too troublesome for you
So if I'm on the edge, then let me get it right
Cause regardless what you sayin'
At the end of the night
(It's still)

[Chorus]
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
Here's my chance to make you feel
What I feel
If it's real
Move on
And god bless the child that can hold his own

[Verse 3 Kutt Calhoun]
Tell me?
You ever been with a relative or a friend
That be tellin' you how to live
Really jealous of how you live
Tryin down you
Look at the people around you
Pointin' who they are
You tell em'
To get some business and stay the fuck outta yours
Cause half of they lives, ain't right, and fucked up more
Shit! Half of them probably can't fight behind closed doors
But they always bringing up these stories
Bout the shit they done did
Thinkin' they gon' get some glory

I never let em'
Get the best of me or stress me
All I wanna do is live my life
But people tend ta.
Wonder, if something is under
???? bring the light
So if you a fo, we can pro, we can go
Personal info don't let everybody know
I like to keep it low
Who I hoe when I roll
So don't you put your nose
Straight through the front door
And stay outta

[Chorus] x3
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
Here's my chance to make you feel
What I feel
If it's real
Move on
And god bless the child that can hold his own

(Outro)
Yeah, said it's my life
Up under the sun wrapped up in the one (yeah)
You ain't gotta deal with it
Just let me live it
It's my life</pre>
