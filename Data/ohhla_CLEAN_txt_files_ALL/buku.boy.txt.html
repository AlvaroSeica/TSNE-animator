[Chorus]
I got buku money
I got buku cars
I got buku clothes
I'm livin' with the stars
[x4]

[Verse 1]
Standin' by the stove, buku bank roll
Yellow diamond shawty, had to shit up on them hoes
Lean in my cup, kush in my blunt
If you reppin' skinny niggas
Gon throw it up (SKINNY NIGGAS)
Westside squad, getcho ass robbed
Money gang boys, yes we stay on our job
Big bank roll, buku hoes
Pull up to the club, lexani on them 4's
Niggas start hatin'
Ak to ya faces
Bitch, talk shit, I'm grabbin' pliers
Removin' braces
Droptop lexus, whole crew flexin'
Ridin' from atlanta all the way to fuckin' texas
Trap goin crazy, crack like the 80's
Droptop maybach got me like patrick swayze
Soulja boy juice'n
80 fuckin' proofin'
When I'm in the booth, Kwon, gon' head salute me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Sippin' out my cup (wassup)
Got a lot a bucks (wassup)
Shop at lenox mall, that's like a 150 plus (wassup)
Duffel bag stuffed, nigga don't fuck with us (wassup)
Choppers on deck, a.k.a. toys'r us (wassup)
Soulja boy swaggin' (wassup)
Pretty boy gangsta (wassup)
Pull up to the club, ak Glock for the wankstas (wassup)
Niggas talkin' down (wassup)
Word around town (wassup)
Snitchin' on my crew will getcho ass shot down (wassup)
Boy I got the juice, money out the roof (wassup)
When my nigga Kwony Cash posted in the booth (wassup)
Westside, Salute (wassup)
Eastside, Respect (wassup)
Southside, Reside (wassup)
Northside, I got them checks (wassup)
Niggas know my name, I ain't playin' no games (wassup)
My yellow diamond Britling put yo whole life to shame (wassup)
My chain cost a mansion, my watch cost a phantom (wassup)
See me in the club still pretty boy dancin', juice
