[Method Man]
Aight?  Check it out (FUCK DAT!)
Word, niggaz smoke too fuckin much man
(Check it out y'all, check it check it out)

[Intro/Chorus]
We can all get by if we want now
Get a fat piece of the pie if we want
Motherfuckers gettin mad high when they want now
I will survive, recognize it be Tical

[Verse One]
Whattup ock?  Niggaz is strapped, ready for war
On the ill block, things just ain't peace no more
Fuck it - if you ain't with me then forget me
Niggaz tried to stick me, retaliation, no hesitation shifty (bitch)
Creepin niggaz in the dark, triggers with no heart
Rippin ass apart, I be swimmin with the sharks now (yeah)
Stay out my water or it's manslaughter
Kid, you oughta start reachin for that nickle-plated auto-
matic (f'real) my thoughts get sporadic (uh)
Loaded raps bustin mad shots to ya attic (woo!)
They say this hazard, this flow's a hazard
Straight from Hazard County with a bounty on his head, and it said
"Wanted Dead or Alive," I swear by the whites of they eyes
To never take a dive I will survive

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
Eeep ock, ihp stop, mmm-barrrrrrrrr
Here we go Star

[Verse Two]
Shit's gonna happen if niggaz start actin
like they want problems, you want 'em, you got 'em
Rap contact, is writin this exact-
ly, the way it should, be, attacked
Killer Beeeees on a swarm
Salaikum asalaam, drops bombs like Qur'an
The ism helps to stimulate my pugilism
I bust rhymes like jism, impregnate the rhythm with the wisdom
Decipher, to see I be hyper
I dwindle the style, that rekindle like old flames
Ssssssss-saliva, check the wicked flows I delivah
Oops, I mean delivers like the Hudson River
Styles be trite, trife like a thief in the night
I be the sneaky-ass nigga bustin nuts in yo wife
Blasted, buggin off Bacardi and acid
Flippin on the mic, it's a classic</pre>
