Shame, yeah.. Uh, tales of the terrorist
Young, black, felonious, red-blooded American
Gave this bitch a taste of that lil' boy, she cherished it 
Fucked her veins up, now she shoot her foot with the heroin
Twinkle toes, know single hoes that like to treat they nose
Sendin muff pics, photos that got they treat exposed (yeah)
I swear you oughta keep yo' daughter from this dirtbag
Dog nigga, scum of the Earth, for what it's worth
I been handlin probation well, smokin blunts
Thirty-six months and I ain't seen the jail
Makin music to make some mail, fuck the recognition
But I guess my record just too reckless for the record business
Won't sell my soul to chase a check but I be checkin niggaz
Eat the ?rum? in interviews
Industry put lames in the game like Duncan Pinderhughes (Bitch!)
Think these niggaz change they persona, they let you pick and choose
Eeny miny moe, so don't try me hoe, bitch I been a fool
Psychopathic, whoop ass like Michael daddy
Everything that touch my skin brand name, my brand new Caddy
Got that pussy-wet paint as I sit on the softest leather
I ain't trippin yo, my ticket to heaven could cost whatever
I just pray the Lord don't toss me with Satan off in the cheap seats 
Thought of dyin broke with no legacy make my knees weak
As I proceed to make ears bleed, let MP3s' leak
Gettin green by any means out on these mean streets
Uhh~! tales of the terrorist
Felonious, red-blooded American
Uh... (...Nigga)</pre>
