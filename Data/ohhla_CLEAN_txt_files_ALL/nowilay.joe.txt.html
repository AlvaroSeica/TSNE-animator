I'd like to welcome everybody, to the Padded Room

[Joe Budden]
Uh, pump it up, you came to get it crunk
A dame to get her drunk, you came to get it uhhh
That's when it all got started (I mean)
Back then I wasn't so cold-hearted (c'mon)
With every stanza came an extravaganza
For every question he got one less answer
I was tryin to be more than cool
Now it was before that, maybe boardin school
That was back when I would wanna danger myself
Maybe it was just to entertain myself
I don't need help, I could change myself
Fuck y'all, I ain't gotta explain myself
Death's around the corner, I can hear his footsteps
Does he think that I'm the only nigga in the hood left?
So child that ain't listenin ain't mine
For 28 years been a prisoner of the mind am I

[Chorus: Joe Budden]
Now I lay me down to sleep
(And I) I pray the Lord my soul to keep
(If I) If I should die before I wake
(Then what?) I pray the Lord my soul to take
(I mean) Now I lay me down to sleep
(And I) I pray the Lord my soul to keep
(If I) If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take

[Joe Budden]
Look, welcome everybody into greater of self but claim center
Even when he can win that nigga won't surrender
Bull's fault, put the wheels in motion
I felt every emotion except devotion
Message in a bottle in the bottom of the ocean
But I can't swim, damnit I can't win, uh
So I don't care how you rate me
It'll take a long time to evaluate me
So if, this be the last time you hear me (nigga)
Just know I got a loved one near me (nigga)
Please don't cry, let her eye get teary
A nigga good, finally I'm somewhere care-free
Past is frightenin but the future's scary
And I'm, gettin to the point that I fear me
In a class all alone, don't compare me
But I, blame God, this is where He steered me
I mean

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Look, they tell me the eyes is the windows to a man's SOUL
What you happen to see a nigga can't con-TROL
... And I've turned a deaf ear
to any nigga, anybody that'll get my head clear
Why shake the dice if you never gon' roll 'em?
I told 'em that the straight jacket can't hold him
I ain't psycho, don't belittle me now
It's just a title cause they couldn't figure me out
If you give a damn when shit hits the fan
Please know anything I ever did a nigga planned
Tryin to better, high as ever
As I learn how to lie to a lie detector
Still I'm damaged
Say if you stay in that boat long enough you see where the land is
So I'm right where I need to be
Please believe it, believe it please
Let's get on our knees

[Chorus]

[Outro: Joe Budden]
One mo' 'gin, c'mon...
Follow me, let's go
OHHHH!
One mo' 'gin, OHHHH!
Mic check one-two one-two
Can anybody hear me?
Soul to keep, if I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to Â– uh
Follow me c'mon, uhh, yeah</pre>
