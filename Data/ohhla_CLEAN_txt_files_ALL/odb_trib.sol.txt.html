[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Dedications... we love ya'll

[Solomon Childs]
Another lost icon, I can't believe O.D.B.
A/K/A Ason, is gone...
A brother, a friend and a father
A scholar, a wise man and a doctor
A pioneer, that influenced the minds of many
Family orientated, the God's face should of been on the gold penny
The whole Wu at the Arena, we repped for real that night
But I knew something wasn't right, that night at the reunion
It's like the fans was so tuned in
Chanting "O.D.B.!", waiting for the moment he moved in
I remember when I first the God
With RZA and Popa Wu, at the studio in Brooklyn
That was the first time, I saw the definition of Brooklyn
The heart, the soul, and the hunger of Brooklyn

[Peace]
Dirty, Ol' Dirty..
Oh how we loved to rhyme
It's a shame, he's gone from us...
He was one of a kind... one of a kind...

[Solomon Childs]
A voice of gold, that echoed off the neighborhood poles
With Supreme Father figaros
Then watched some of the livest thugs break down
And sing Luther songs...
To the jazz players, blowing "Hear &amp; Now"
Out the horns, such an icon
I wish I could of done a song with him, before he was gone
My mother can't believe he gone
What a phenomenal man to the music world
Love songs, that could of changed the world
Charisma, with the smile of God
I know we gotta go, but it's funny
That the lord chose Luther's card
But now when I hear the angel sing in the sky
Or see a beautiful star cross
You can believe that that's the late great, Mr. Vandross

[Shellz]
Luther, Luther...
You set the world on fire, world on fire...
He can touch and heal your heart, heal your heart...
Now he's up above, up above...

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
To the families of O.D.B. and Luther Vandross
Let God be with you... check that out...</pre>
