[Verse 1: Apathy]
Yeah...
I'm like a '88 classic, Apathy goes back
To Fila's with straps and Don Mattingly throwbacks
I'm back bitch, on some asshole rap shit
Rarely ever seen like Asian dudes with black chicks
You muthafuckas wanna scrap? Be quiet!
You know when Apathy drops, you happily buy it
All these cats are a riot, wanna rap, so they try it
But'll quit as quick as Ruben Studdard on the Atkins diet
I ain't the type to blow scratch on tricks
Slap tricks in the trap if teeth scratch the dick
Chicken's in the kitchen makin' chicken from scratch and shit
Check it, Chum's on the track with the scratch and mix
Y'all don't even understand who you scrappin' with
I got Timbs in the trunk, won't scratch my kicks
Y'all are brewin' up a plot, tryin' to get Ap to flip?
Do yourself a favor - scratch that shit, 'cause...

[Chorus]
Even though muthafuckas tryin' to see me...
"Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me"
