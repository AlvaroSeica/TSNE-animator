Yeah everybody wanna know who Jacki-O is (Jacki-O)
Well I'm just a girl  that's trying to stay a float
Trying to make it out of this struggle no scars
It's hard real hard baby you just got to do
What you got to do, do what you got to do

[Jacki-O]
My old girl gave me strength and she raised me well
She said don't hold in you got to write about this hell
Well momma you had a born winner and I ain't crazy
I'm a survivor hell I'm a 80's baby
The streets raised me
A bitch don't get no rougher then that
Liberty City? It don't get no tougher then that
Don't get it twisted I'm from the hood
I'm a fortunate girl
I see more money then them bitches in the corporate world
Kick in the cloey party in prada, shop at the harbor?
I'm a booster bitch, why bother?
I love the way my weed blow in the ghetto breeze
I'm in Miami where I live it ain't no palm tree's
Niggaz be on the block with work they got from the dock
We Flintsone kids we surrounded by bricks and rocks
And my thugs don't give a fuck about catching a case
We bring them stacks back I-95 and they exit on 8

(Hook- [Jacki-O] O'Damia)
I'm addicted to this ghetto world
(survive in these streets)
It's hard on a ghetto girl
(making ends meat)
What am I gonna do? When this is the life I choose

[Jacki-O]
This nigga put me down but he started to change
He put the chevy up nigga went and cop the range
Tucking in his shit then he started talking funny
But I say I'm a gutter bitch and I won't change for money
I ain't a little girl I'm out here on my own
And the decisions I made they turnt me to a woman
The booze the bars the jumping into dudes cars
Fights with broads the life of a ghetto star
I could be lamping on ripplekey? I done seen the stacks
But I be in U.S.A getting my weed stacked
If that's chanel I'm rocking maybe a topic
Of a bitch conversation in the latest street gossip
So be it I don't even see it
I just breeze through the hood
Blow tree's and I'm good
The box of shifty I'm linking bout fifty
My gutter bitches get me vibe and sing with me

(Hook- [Jacki-O]O'Damia)
I'm addicted to this ghetto world
(survive in these streets)
It's hard on a ghetto girl
(making ends meat)
What am I gonna do? When this is the life I choose

[Jacki-O]
It's been so bad to fast walking the streets
Auction for half the cost we got it for free
That's how we eat showing love breaking tips off
Making ends meat with that instant credit rips off
We love the streets ain't nothing out of reach
We play hard and be strong the struggle won't be long
As I open up my window to a new day
The sun shine but the skies are still gray
All the scars I bare I'm glad God is there
Aint no complaints it's hard but it's fair
I ain't laying down even when it's trouble
It ain't nothing I just keep me a hustle
I roll through the beams then through the scotts
Enjoying my hood and listening to pac
I remember not to let it control me
I just keep my head up and I won't let it fold me

(Hook- [Jacki-O] O'Damia)
I'm addicted to this ghetto world
(survive in these streets)
It's hard on a ghetto girl
(making ends meat)
What am I gonna do? When this is the life I choose
