[Chorus]
All my dogs if you ready for war
Make a fist like you clutching a sword
Pumping ya fist praising the Lord
Say Praise the Lord! {2X}
All my ladies if ya free from Hades
Said yes to the Lord no maybes
Let me see ya wave these
Say Praise the Lord! {2X}

[Verse 1]
I'm a angel or just below, let the record show
I've been holding back now I'ma let it go, let em know
That Jesus is commander in chief, the general
Of my heart, body and soul, call me I'm a roll
What's the orders my Lord, cross the borders with sword
In fist tell the world this, they need to enlist, In me
believe he'll take the power out ya enemies
Give ya true, brothers and sistas, scratch all ya friend of me's
Give ya peace in the midst of the storm, my lord could never go wrong
His people unique never the norm
Strap on ya gear, cause its war for righteousness
And I'ma stay writin' this, cause triple 6 be fightin' us
In Jesus name enlighten us, with the wisdom and strength, to the whole length
Just to bless your name, let the fragrance
Fill this house throughout, every room, crack and cabinet
My cabinet ain't having it, the world wants war, bibles we grabbing it
Cause I'm angel you, know the angle
We tight never loose like bangles, or Kraft singles
I talk to my Lord, don't mingle, don't fake the tingle
The spirit of truth will have me raising the roof

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
My God is an awesome God, cause I'm living proof
Of taking back what the devil stole, according to the Lords scroll
Many revelations told, I thank Jesus for saving my soul
Making me gold, my spirit rich like mineral
Its time to round the army up and move like men from Israel
He changed me from Saul to Paul, wall to wall
I'll never fall, just heed his call, he bled for y'all
But you still sin, how you kill men, talking bout you God's children
He never knew you, duke who you talking too, this ain't a fade something cool to do
Who be schooling you the flesh it figures, ya loosing vigor
In the race for a peace of mind, God is mine, mind divine
Sean be reping thru, my lyrics hard like a technical
Cause its real in the field, whatever's in ya heart is reflecting you
Catch my 2nd wind, let me rep again
The God who saved me from hell flames to heaven's gates
His words I'll meditate, forever wait, till he levitates
On that might cloud, call me out, say you made me proud faithful soldier
You kept me warm when I was cold
When I was naked in the world son, you kept me clothed
When I was prison, you comfort me with a visit
Gave drink to a thirsty man, put food in my hand
You followed every command, upon demand
Come hither, the Kingdom is yours, he got angels in scores
Praising the lord, till we sweat from our pores
In my glorified body, the earth is just a stomping ground
Till the cloud descends, judging men when the trumpet sounds

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Let fellowship, politic, the book of truth knowledge it
The seventh day hallow it, To live it is to follow it
I wallow in the presence of Christ, with my mic device
Pure like virgin Mary is what my chain symbolize
That's my goal to reach, to hear clear when the lord speaks
And not just prophecy, in love, Christ got the monopoly
But not a boardwalk, this peace cant be store bought
A demon onslaught, wars fought just to rest in the Lords court
I'll keep battling, grabbing snakes by they tails rattling
Trying to change them into sheep, kid its deep
Adam cursed his freewill, Cain let the blood spill
No more harmony, the world steady try harming me
But the church is steady arming me, tools for the saints
Daily prayer, supplication, giving with thanks
Will have ya testimonial confessing, Christ blessing
On how he set you free, when ya world was in a mess and
Learned ya lesson, now you teaching what you faced
Walk wit Christ at a pace the sweetest sound amazing grace
