[Verse One: Action Bronson]
Yo! Like the leaf made sugar sweat, inhale the mystic
The three shells by the toilet are futuristic
I'm so ridiculous, my mental sickness
Women love 'em light skin brown with less thickness
A Queens thing no shoes in the atomy room
Legs crossed sippin hot saki
Big drugs like a sushi roll, she see the cops
Throw the drug up in the poopy hole, plus she stay there cool
Eyes shinin like diamonds smilin like new veneers
Fuck 'em once left the souvenir
Plus she take it through the rear door
I watched her change now ball and got a clear floor, halibut sealed off
I'm not impressed those cigars full with pesto
Smokin rings, lemon from Ernesto
Straight from Queens where it's wise to wear a vest bro
We blowin up in the world I never let go

[Chorus: Statik Selektah Scratchin] (Female)

[Verse Two: Kool G. Rap]
The streets know how I get down I bang these weaponries
So think +Before I Let Go+ like Frankie Beverly
Yeah I creep with your wife kid her brain be heavily
Dribble on my balls so crazy her game need a referee
Come and run on me and complain lean my presence squeeze
I'll hit your frame 'til you shit stains and wet with pee
I'm a loose shooter the color of the coupe puter
Stewardess on a dick on a plane to Aruba
Introduced her to the mile high club then scooped her
Told the bitch that I'm the Q.U. Larry Hoover
I run things in the sewers with flames from the ruegers
Keep heat like saunas, crimes for the drama
With body armor up in the Louis Vuitton farmers
Still trapped in the 80's Dapper Dan crazy
Tan mercedes whippin passed the traffic jam baby
Hundred grand wrapped in rubber bands nigga straight cheese
It's me!

[Chorus: Statik Selektah Scratchin] (Female)
