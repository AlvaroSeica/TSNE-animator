[Verse 1]
Yo fuck rapping &amp; bragging
About the way you ballin'
Spray cans in my backpack
And I was starvin'
In middle school
With a trey five-seven revolver
My family said I wouldn't make it
Now I'm grindin' hard
I dedicated this to the kids
Growin' up with no father
Believe me I know what you goin' through
I almost lost it
Ever seen a teenage boy
Whose feelin' like robbin'?
That was me at 14
I was driving through Compton
On my way to Inglewood
I was thinkin' of nonsense
Somebody tagging on the wall
So I had to go cross it
Muthafucka I had guns
In my mother's closet
The day she caught me
Tear drops started falling
Then she slapped me in the face
Looking brokenhearted
How the fuck do I explain
That my hood is stronger
Enemies is lookin' for me
2 in the morning
Its about the 2 weeks
And she still ignores me
I'm fucking up so much
As hate
That is building towards me
She's on the phone with my fam
Saying I'm disappointing
Saying I'm disappointing
Oh man, I'm a disappointment

[Chorus: David Ortiz &amp; King Lil G]
As I sit all alone with pain
I wonder
Will I ever see my mother smile?
I wonder
Will I ever see my mother smile?
Am I ever gonna see that day
We stop strugglin'
Will I ever see my mother smile?
Strugglin', yea..

[Verse 2]
Yo, would you like to know
Why I was so troublesome?
That eviction notice on my door
Made me hustle drugs
I seen my mother crying
1999
My father left us behind
My feelings empty inside
I try to not miss 'em
Me &amp; my older sister
Carina please tell 'em
Bout that fucked up Christmas
I had to go to school
Lying to my friends
Pretending I was happy
Bout some shit I didn't get
Fake smiles
Through the whole winter
I was cold wearing old clothes
And socks with holes in 'em
Gang members I was close with 'em
I was just a kid
They was asking me
To do some coke with 'em
I was broke
Man I rather sell some dope with 'em
Road trips to the border to go get 'em
Young &amp; hopeless
Trying to get in to show biz
Hoping they would give me a chance
Nobody noticed

[Chorus: David Ortiz &amp; King Lil G]

[King Lil G]
Oh man, you know what really trips me out is that uh..
People really think I owe them somethin'
See I hear people talkin' all the time
But its like they don't know the struggle
And the shit we gotta go through
To get to where we are right now
(but I don't owe them a damn thing)
I had to sacrifice so much time, you know
Had to put my family trough so much pain
Its like everything that I got right now, I owe it to the family
Finally my mother can smile now
Oh yeah</pre>
