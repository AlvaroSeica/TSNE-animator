[Intro] 
What is the magic the makes ones eyes sparkle and gleam
light up the skies the name of the game is lightworks

I see you're peein' in you pants little sissy boy

[DOOM]
Jerks... welcome to the Octagon
Lay a player flat before the trainer felt his clock was on
Keep your socks torn, its a box-a-thon
With hard rock, black, Rock &amp; Ron's gon' barbizon
Curled up beggin, layin on the canvas
Instead of in the ready position like praying mantis
Scissors, Lanvis, grand fist, sandwich, stan switch 
Slammed on stitches switch hands inch, damn snitch
Any street corner could be the platform till we defeat gone and wander
Watch your mouth jaw southpaw outs floor 
Doubt your clout more bout roar outscore boy
Off the leash like UFC 
Off the beat off ya feet like two lefties
F U B's heifer please lost a few to stew beef 
New referees, what a remarkable team sold ya teeth

[Chorus]
The shine that sparkles and gleams
light up the signs the name of the game is the lightworks
Light up the spliffs the name of the game is lightworks

Wipe off slight smirks
The match was mapped out 
Get jabbed and crap slapped out tapped out
Either the lunch bin or choke hold tie   
Time munchkins get punched in like vocal rhyme

[Chorus]
The shine that sparkles and gleams
light up the signs the name of the game is the lightworks

Light up the spliffs the name of the game is lightworks

[Outro]
