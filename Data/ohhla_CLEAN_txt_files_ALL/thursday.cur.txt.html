Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
My own head told me kill them bitches
Rollin out while we handle our business
I know the haters there but we ain't trippin'
Shit, we too busy being them niggas
We too busy being them niggas
We too busy being them niggas
We too busy being them niggas
Big money, good weed and fly bitches

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
High dealings, high ceilings
Hot bitches, high heeling
I'm smooth, hair and bone over to Oxford
We fuckin mobsters, we just cop the car, fuck it
We rave the spot and drop duckets
You hate it, I love it
On the low you admire me, probably dub it
You know how they do
Use your own shit and try to play you
Haters hate, but I'm slick though
Respect, you getting zero
Chop, cold cut, tryna be hero
Got the dower for a courteous price
My Cali bitch brought thirty on a flight
Nigga, Ripley's Believe It or Not
It'll be gone before you get off the clock
You hustlin' minimal caine
Throw your work in the air like 'Bron before the game
Full partners in bucket hats
Designer sweat pants in them fresh 3's
We gave you niggas the blueprint
Knock ahead, and get fresh B
All that double R round like then we supply shit
Let's not forget Rakim
I said go ahead and get fresh B
My nigga D the baby do the white on whites on
Yall throw yours back on
Yea, go ahead and get fresh B

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Backseat cypher
Me, my weed, my lighter
Pass the weed to my driver
My driver like MacGyver
Get me in and out of
Traffic where they catch it
I'm van the nick and time of these lil bars ain't rhyme up
They uh, kinda
Tryna be like us
So styles, I improvise em
Copycat niggas, you a box of kitty litter
A boss ain't in ya
So you takin' losses in the time you go against us
Bitches get something to remember when they visit
On the corner with me and that normal G was hittin switchers
Now you go low 'cus she no longer wanna be wit ya
I'm out Soho strappin, stop, take some pictures
Real recognize the same kind
Ape shit, I never killed another primate
Cadillac trucks back to back outside
While we inside buyin bate
You too broke to fix yo face hah?

[Chorus]</pre>
