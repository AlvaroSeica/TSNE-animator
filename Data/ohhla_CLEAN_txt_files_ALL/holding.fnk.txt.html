[Carlito Brigante]
"Somebody's pulling me close to ground
 I can sense but I can't see
 I ain't panicked, I've been here before
 Same as when I got popped, on a Hundred Fourth Street
 Oh, look at these suckers, scrambling around, what for?
 My Puerto Rican ass ain't supposed to have made it this far
 Most of my crew got washed a long time ago
 Don't worry....my heart, it don't ever quit"

[SonDoobie]
Taking back from that which it came from
Holding it down, now what son, say something
Holding it down, how you holding it down, holding it down
Taking back from that which it came from
Holding it down, now what son, say something
Holding it down, how you holding it down, holding it down

[SonDoobie]
The organized, fortified, SonDoob's immortalized
Rap acts borderline, M.C.'s is horrified
All the while glorified, those can't demoralize
My chorus line mesmorized, notify
All my peeps, keep your nose clean
Between you and me, Redeem cash for dreams
Take care your team, ill self-esteem
The cream, make sure your world, or so it seems

-"What's going on L?"
-"Yo, what's the deal daddy?"
-"Nothing papi, what's going out there in the East?"
-"Yo maintaining, getting this money
  Yo what's the deal up in the West?"
-"Same this papi, not trying to get up"
-"Yo love is love, maintain"
-"It's all family right?"
-"It's all family."

I be that rifraf lounging on your Ave, scrambling
Getting money gambling, Celo, betting Hamiltons
Everyday, I'm on the money hunt, smoke twenty blunts
Ass out with smoking honeys blunt
Me and my peoples burn to keep destroyin' evils
From attractin' from the way we be acting
They call me derelict and say I roll with spics
In a clique too thick, it makes it hard for them to ride my dick
You don't need to, cuz I don't need you
Just a weed to keep me from flipping, cuz it's lethal

[?]
The industry fears me
I touch a track down with eight bars severly
You know the dealy, for really
I get you open like acts, and worldwide rap tours
Everything I wrote soaked around in black force
Be familiar, thick like we was pasta
La Raza, Ricans and Rastas splashing casas
Who's the imposter, talking beef
I'll cap his teeth like polar
Wisdom to the molars
Spics that real, like solars

Taking back from that which it came from
Holding it down, now what son, say something
Holding it down, how you holding it down, holding it down
Taking back from that which it came from
Holding it down, now what son, say something
Holding it down, how you holding it down, holding it down

[Tony Touch]
Ay yo, you know me, Tony, representing cultura
All star like Fania, Johhny Ventura
Ay yo, SonDoobie, papi tengo la cura
Rap over wax, and scratching my aguja
That's how I hold it down, for my corio
P.R, out in the beach, up in luqiyo
Watch out for them sharks, you know, Piyos
Bite on the next mans formats and stilos
But we know, who out theres the bandido
Tainos, like me, remain brown-dido

[Easy D]
Clowns!, I'mma holding down, with the four pound
to the crowd, lying face down, on the ground
Not making a sound, now in case u jump off
Lyrical sawed-off, got you caught off guard
While hard niggas u run with, run off
Ready to flip, fuck up a shit, word to my brother
Hang with a gang, ready to band, regardless of color
I'm color blind, I heat the track like summertime
When is it mine?, in case I got to bust a rhyme
Bait the rhyme, maybe rape the rhyme or fuck the rhyme
Marry the rhyme, cuz Easy D, love the rhyme

Taking back from that which it came from
Holding it down, now what son, say something
Holding it down, how you holding it down, holding it down
Taking back from that which it came from
Holding it down, now what son, say something
Holding it down, how you holding it down, holding it down</pre>
