[Layzie Bone]
Young soldier {*echoes*}

Do you really wanna ride ride 
with a nigga from the East 9-9-9
Where the cities and the streets all mine mine
and the hustlers stay on the grind, all the time
It's designed, for warriors and rebels to win (win)
Them pussies and fakes don't get in (in)
This life is a gamble
How much can you handle? Redrum
Like real niggaz do real thangs
Nigga get the money cause it ain't no game
A lot of these niggaz wanna do shit strange
Down to sell ya soul for a second of fame
Take it from a nigga that is grippin a cane
for the love of the money, nigga that's the aim
Run into some shit that you can't explain
Nigga out the do' and nigga you's to blame
Oh well, on to the next young nigga 
with the next flow shoulda put the medal to met-al
Better learn how to move in stride 
cause you gotta survive when you comin from the ghet-to
Better get on the level 
cause this is the business if you want the money mayne
We ain't playin with you niggaz out here 
If you owe me dawg you better run it mayne

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
Young soldier... young soldier...
Young soldier... young soldier, young soldier
... young soldier...
Young soldier... young soldier, young soldier

[Bizzy Bone]
Homies, enemies wanna be, never they gonna be, anything comin to Bizzy
Get rid of me now, not even payin attention I mention we stuck in the kizzy
City to city, we keepin it movin and doin it, smokin embalming fluid
Sherm I'm high, oh so high, riddle me now and show them how we do it
Get to it, ruin this the way it should be done
then we jet 'em and we bet 'em a grand 
Now give me the boot, the fam, Philomina my gran
and Macedonia feelin me man
Runnin with that hour, that glass, that sand that shifted
that gifted, that lifted and we're never alone 
Call up the Bone as if I've run out of money
and yes it's funny and this gold they come and welcome me home
Right through that mystical, critical thinkin and critical drinkin
The blink of an eye, better be careful when wakin my mind 
Tell 'em the truth I don't need to lie 
Feelin embarrassed and baby I was straight up walkin in truthfulness
And never again do I have to worry about Ruthless
ROO! Give me that paper paper paper paper
We got to escape that, never get caught up by that raper, raper
See that's that caper caper Â– Superman!
Doin it better and better and the wetter the rhythm, we givin 'em a 100%
Stuck with the skrilla with Baby and Wayne again
Bizzy, you know my name, my name

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
They run in yo' crib and they go in yo' pockets dawg 
Young niggaz ain't ready for war
We been doin this shit since 'Pac and Eazy 
Y'all better just open the door
Anything else'll get you handled dawg 
Might as well, turn them cameras off
When Nationalville was lookin at y'all 
I'ma make it to where you can never floss
Young niggaz is soft and lame to me 
and I'm comin to change this industry
Back to the way it used to be 
when niggaz was really out runnin them streets
Y'all niggaz be practicin tuck and hide
We the killers nigga, we buck and ride
I say what I say and it's from inside
Real thug shit, it'll never die

[Chorus]</pre>
