[Intro: Latif]
Here in Cali we be paper touchin!

[Chorus: Latif]
It all started out in Brooklyn
Yo! But the kid kept it movin
Uh! I came along way from hustlin
Now it's worldwide paper touchin
Here in Cali we be paper touchin!
Here in Cali we be paper touchin!
 
[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Uh, the Big Wills sittin on big wheels
Brooklyn's back, imagine how B.I.G. feel
(WHAT ELSE?) Yeah I am a big deal
Tell 'em keep the change, when I break big bills
Talk is cheap, everyone could afford it
This for the hustlers, everyone should applaud it (Uh)
Getcha camera phone, everyone should record it (Ah!)
I'm the pizza man, I delivers the orders (Woo!)
Arm &amp;, Ham-in-mer, hammin the grits
Homey, I'll cut your wrist off put your hands on my grits!
See, I be the Konvict, I am fully committed
Took my shoes off and laughed, they couldn't fit it (WHAT ELSE?!)
If I don't do nothin I'm a ball
Fall through your city, shut down the mall (THAT ALL!!)
I'm 2Pac with it, I got the Juice
Soldier, but only the gangstas I salute
 
[Chorus: Latif]
It all started out in Brooklyn
Yo! But the kid kept it movin
Uh! I came along way from hustlin
Now it's worldwide paper touchin
Here in Cali we be paper touchin!
Here in Cali we be paper touchin!

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
She's sick of that song on how it's so long since she met a G like me
First it was Kane then it was B.I.G. then it was Jay
And she love the homey F.A.B. now me
(IT'S R!!!!) Flowrific white flower I whip it
Spin it round and round stand on my pivot
Keep that white girl Christina Aguilera
I seen the king soon as I get a mirror  (WHAT ELSE?!)
Gettin fresh and lettuce be my fetish
Retired with the chips like Jerome Bettis
I wonder, if I stack bread like Wonder
Would my woman's first name be Wonder?
When it comes to me they are Stevie Wonder
They can't see I, I am the I.G. student
Make 'em holla it's movin
Make 'em light it up and get the boozin

[Chorus: Latif]
It all started out in Brooklyn
Yo! But the kid kept it movin
Uh! I came along way from hustlin
Now it's worldwide paper touchin
Here in Cali we be paper touchin!
Here in Cali we be paper touchin!

[Outro: Red Cafe] (Latif)
Hey Sukon you know I gotta diddy bop to this one (Paper touchin!)
Why not?! Huh! (Paper touchin)</pre>
