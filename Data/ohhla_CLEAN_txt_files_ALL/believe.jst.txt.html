[King Just]
I done said it all in the verbal brawl, why you wanna fall
Like the Berlin Wall, man you got some balls, and you got your ear
Bring 'em all, I ain't scared of ya'll, winter, spring, summer, fall
I defeat all of all, cuz it's back, 1999, the grind don't pay
Cuz niggas dropping dimes for dollars
Trust me dog, we gonna holler, it's the carter
Back to give out the drama partner, bring 'em up
Cassette go, here's a race for the dough
Throw you from the Grand Canyon -- yo, yo -- that's the echo
Let go my Eggo, man, they not even done yet
Why you still in the projects with that bum bitch
Pump this in the stereo, how real is the video
Beat down battle you with rhymes I wrote a year ago
Been in it, ever since, Sergio Valente
Krush Groove, namebelts, the cell phones, skelly
Shell tops, boom box, crack rock, be inside a
Weed spot, he's hot, he got
More than what you bargain for, hardcore
Sword like the condor, in the four-door Explorer
So war, never say never no more
Cuz my name is being told like Herbert for raw
Mister Choke Armstrong, just in case you smoke
Took a sworn oath, on some lakes, let her blow back
Explode, and loc without the blue on
For the right amount, you can get a discount without the coupon
Get the soup on, getting fame off the pain
How can you act like, somebody else, when you ain't yourself
I'd rather have all my niggas
Then your wealth, your stealth unheard until I hit like your belt
And making cheese on the phony bologna
If I owe the world, who the fuck owe me, homey
Don't play that, matter of fact, don't even say that
Ran with the same pack, rhymed on the same track
Turned your back, where's your heart at
Fuck that, if you that slow, I gotta draw it on the map
Right on the back of a brick, and hit you with it
Put it in one long verse and fucking spit it
Shit it, before you even signed a contract
You ain't going nowhere plus you can't come back
The tale of the backstabber, slash, half rapper
The people's champ, it really doesn't matter
Can't cramp my style, if I had, PMS
Optimus is gonna shine, regardless, without begets
Who you rep, who your idol threats, contact get connects
In your own projects, what you expect
From a vet, nothing less, but the best
Mr. JR Ewing, moving the Falcon Crest
Getting karats and I carry them, jakes harassing 'em
Go way back like icey's and Miss Peterson
Madison Square, be there, plus beware
Prepare, ain't no victories tooken here
I strike fear in the evil that men do, fuck you
If you ain't running with the Who You crew
Knew it was too good to be true, do you cuz we fear less
Another one bites the Just, quick flush the excess
Bullshit, rhyme full clip, I declare war, who you running with
You started this shit, when you see me, don't holler, it was all about us
Now it's all about a dollar, the lord master was the teacher's scholar
Professor, a mighty supreme God, King Just, yo nigga, don't even bother
Spark that, session, learn a lesson, I ain't stressing
You'll never find another KJ in this profession, word</pre>
