Please come visit me, dawg
Well back in 1912, I could kick your ass
I did the tango and the foxtrot before it got banned
There was ragtime and jazz before there ever was rap
Now Im trapped with a colostomy bag in my pants
I just rap just to get by
Now I'm kicked to the side
Sucking blood from the back of my neck, I recollect
Suffer jet set, just to get...

So I got liver spots bigger than dalmatian dots
I'm all alone, won't you please come visit me, dawg

Please come visit me, dawg
The residue of many who, are about to die
Emitted from tragic castle which I'm now reside
Come before seven, that's when they close the blinds
Strap me down, steal my watch which is no surprise
I suck applesauce through a bendy straw
When I poop, all the nurses come in and applaud
I used to slap at their

Bowel trouble you'll, stooool sample, soft and loose
soft and loose you got to give me the juice, the Metamuc'

Roll me homie
My hips all boney, I getting sores, I getting lonely</pre>
