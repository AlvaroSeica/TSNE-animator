[Product]
1-	Ho Maria Maria,
	She reminds me of a west side story,
	Growing up in Spanish Harlem,
	SheÂ’s living her life just like a movie star,

2-	Ho Maria Maria
	She fell in love in East L.A.
	To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
	Played by Carlos Santana

[Wyclef]
Stop the looting, stop the shooting,
Pick pocking on the corner,
See as the rich is getting richer,
The poor is getting poorer


3-	Se mira Maria on the corner,
	Thinking of ways to make it better,
       	In my mailbox there's an eviction letter,
	Somebody just said see you later

[Santana]
4-	Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola,
	Ahora vengo mama chola

Repeat 4

I said a la favella los colores,
The streets are getting hotter,
There is no water to put out the fire,
Mi canto la esperanza

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Repeat 3
Repeat 4

Maria you know you're my lover,
When the wind blows I can feel you,
Through the weather and even when we're apart,
It feels like we're together.</pre>
