and the game dont quit
he he ha ha
and it goes a lil something like this
 
up a tree up a tree up a tree
wont you take a ride with me
mr L-U-V up on Atlantic/YBB
I got more chips than Doritos
I'm incognito, way too clean
I bet you never seen a
rappin misdemeanor
got that game for your brain
tape in your deck in your ride
trying to soak up every word
finna wreck, stay rewind
and got em sprung off the tongue
thought you knew this game don't quit
24 forever hustlin
I just keep on grindin hits
fiend for chips
geared to get
represent and uplift
never trick never switch
LINK crew for the 90's bitch
pop n' flip got the grip
stay about yo mail young pimp
watch out coz them gangsta hits
posseses like the exorcist
get next to this leather
even through the stormy weather
I prevail makin mail coz I'm 
way too clever
my endeavor is to flip a meal ticket
and have you zappin young Ray Luv
when you kick it
 
mr gigalo givin mo 
game than you can follow
stickin to the script servin them hollow playas swallow
your pride
and your girlie ride with big eddie
coz I would do the same trick
I'm all about the fetti
 
take a ride with the luvva man
take a ride with the luvva man
ride with the luvva man
 
take a ride with the luvva man
take a ride with the luvva man
ride with the luvva man
 
comin wit it tho
givin mo
game that you livin fo
fresh up out of 94
in the deuce triple-oh
cant nothin stop this mackin no 
I'm taking what I'm lacking coz
money motivates my mind when I'm stackin
got it crackin like a street corner
I envision ray luv bustin raps on a
television rip a nitche up in this rap game
like an incision
roll the dice like a crap game
money's the mission
I just flip the game tell you all what happened to me
tape in your deck and mr Luv up in the passenger seat
bumpin and blastin the beat
thats what they lovin from me
why aint they buying your tapes?
you aint in touch with the street
you must be blind and cant see
I'm what you trying to be
they pop eject on your record
they push rewind when I speak
I take em high as a rocket
mr dark chocolate
I'm the man 50 grand got two in my pocket
thought you knew when I shocked it
I would blow up
grew up with ballers a baby couldn't wait to grow up
about to sew up
the industry
remember me
I got my eyes on the prize take a ride with the L-U-V
 
take a ride with the luvva man
take a ride with the luvva man
ride with the luvva man
 
take a ride with the luvva man
take a ride with the luvva man
ride with the luvva man
 
take a ride with the luvva man
take a ride with the luvva man
ride with the luvva man
 
take a ride with the luvva man
take a ride with the luvva man
ride with the luvva man
 
I'm so cool call me coolio
coz when I hit the studio
the voyage is fantastic
player haters drasticly
envious and jealous
thats what they ho's tell us
when they choosin
thats why a dirty mack is always loosin
I'm cruisin on true's and
vogues with the gold stripe
folding bank roll from the hole in my windpipe
its the luvva man baby you dont understand
representin once again L-C to the end
young hustlas international crack smugglers
game jugglers 
North Bay ballin bubblers
brother the game gets sticky like a Zig-Zag
tricky player in fact
it's hard to keep it intact
at times you might think you gonna lose your mind
just push rewind and soak the game up out of every line
and you gone find a young soldier back against the wall
in the game makin mail off of all of yall

mr gigalo givin mo 
game than you can follow
stickin to the script servin them hollow playas swallow
your pride
and your girlie ride with big eddie
coz I would do the same trick
I'm all about the fetti
 
take a ride with the luvva man
take a ride with the luvva man
ride with the luvva man
 
take a ride with the luvva man
take a ride with the luvva man
ride with the luvva man
