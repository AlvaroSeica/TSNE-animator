Go go go go go go go on love
It's my birthday
You look tarty love, it's my birthday
I'll buy you a Bacardi love, it's my birthday
And you know I'm having a laugh, it's not my birthday

You can find me in the pub with a pint of Bud
Look love I got a fiver if you let me see your jugs
I'm into playing darts, I ain't into growing shrubs
So come fill up my mug before my bag gets stuck

You can find me in the pub with a pint of Bud
Look love I've got a fiver if you let me see your jugs
I'm into playing darts, I ain't into growing shrubs
So come fill up my mug before my fag gets stubbed

When I pull up out front you see my Vauxhall Nova
When I hit the bar it's ten pints before I'm over
I came to watch the game 'cause I'm a Blackburn Rover
And I munch on M &amp; M's while I'm down in smirn over
But only nothing's changed cash down bottoms up
And I've got a paper cut from rolling my rizzla up
When you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a geezer or gimp
'Cause I fell down my stairs and now I walk with a limp
In the crap bits of Watford they say "50 you hot!"
They like me I want them to love me like lesbians trot
But go to Hemel Hempstead and they'll tell you I'm crazy
'Cause I once got drunk and humped a statue of a lady
But I'm fully focused now tea and coffee on my mind
Got a part time job in the Daily Grind
Now this girl yeah she likes my hair she likes my part
Her friend is fit but she's as ugly as an - (interuption) "alright!"

You can find me in the pub with a pint of bud
Look love I got a fiver if you let me see your jugs
I'm into playing darts, I ain't into growing shrubs
So come fill up my mug before my bag gets stuck

You can find me in the pub with a pint of bud
Look love I've got a fiver if you let me see your jugs
I'm into playing darts I ain't into growing shrubs
So come fill up my mug before my fag gets stubbed

My girlfriend's mum gave me the cash that bought me all my fancy stuff
My couch, my fridge, my plates, my weights
Look mate I'm tied down but I ain't changed
And you should love it, well more than I hate it
You're like my dad, fashion sense is outdated
I'm that bloke by the bar when I'm on my round
You're the weird guy who never leaves or makes a sound
When the beats are pumping I get my Macarana on
My mates drag me to my chair before the end of the song
If the roof's on fire someone dial 999
And if you wanna get drunk love, it isn't a crime
I'll tell you what I tell every girl "You're fit, nice hair
If you don't wanna rush it here's another Red Square"
Or I could tell my mates I'll be round the back with a Kronenbourg
They'll know where we'll, be yeah

You can find me in the pub with a pint of Bud
Look love I got a fiver if you let me see your jugs
I'm into playing darts, I ain't into growing shrubs
So come fill up my mug before my bag gets stuck

You can find me in the pub with a pint of Bud
Look love I've got a fiver if you let me see your jugs
I'm into playing darts I ain't into growing shrubs
So come fill up my mug before my fag gets stubbed.

Ha-ha
Don't act like you don't know where I've been either mum
In the pub all the time mum
It's about to pop off mum
