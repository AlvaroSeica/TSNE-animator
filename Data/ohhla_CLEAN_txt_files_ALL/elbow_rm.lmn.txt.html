Song:   Elbow Room
Typed by: hknight@geocities.com

Elbow room, I need some elbow room
With all this ambition I need elbow room
You know what time it is
But you won't look at the clock
You want to keep going when you know you should stop

There's groups, a lot
With demos to shop
Like they're the ?Bedos?
But they're not
Wake up from the dream
Go back to school
Get an education
An occupation
Can't chase a dead cat
Can't get too far on a bike if the tires are flat
You have a homie who has a cousin
Who used to cut the hair of an intern at a label
Who says he's able to pass a word to his boss
Yeah, it's a lead but his boss doesn't know his first name
Perpetration is the game
It's that
I'm ahead of you kid, Big Busy, Mad Child
God showed me I don't fit in the scheme of things
At the most I rock a chain and my wedding ring
We're all different from one another
Beyond color, the mystery has been uncovered

[Chorus 2X]
Elbow room, I need some elbow room
With all this (opposition / ambition) I need elbow room
You know what time it is
But you won't look at the clock
You want to keep going when you know you should stop

Prevent the mistake is how I think
You better fix the leak before the boat sinks
Labels put money in to get money back
Turn around and blame the public when the group is wack
Point blank, I'm stating the fact
I'm cutting down the rubbish with my _battle axe_
I see why people think rap is trash
A song is garbage if it's all about cash
I understand survival is key
But where will you be when there's no more money?
Blank and empty, unfulfilled
For me, it's allmighty God; not the dollar bill
I wasn't born with the crew; I won't die with the crew
I can't be frustrated, I can just pray for you
If your flesh wants to rap but your spirit says no
I suggest you listen to the spirit, grow, and grow

[Chorus 2X]

If rap is your calling it must have been a crank call
Get some caller ID
So you know where it's coming from
Before you pick it up and waste a bunch of time on the phone
Speaking on my behalf, every waking second
Is self-examination, constantly facing
Where can I improve according to spiritual law
As a man of flesh, as a man of flaw?
Can't do it without you, Lord
I'm a co-dependent
You know my heart and whether I meant it
Man's more concerned with pleasing man before pleasing You
We can say what you want but we know it's true
Yes, this is message music
Speaking to those who abuse it
Mess around and lose it
Everything we do is recorded
Hell is the price of sin; I can't afford it, No!

[Chorus 2X]

You want to keep rapping when you know you should stop
You want to keep graphing when you know you should stop
You want to keep scratching when you know you should stop
You want to keep dancing when you know you should stop
You want to keep bashing when you know you should stop
You want to keep amping when you know you should stop
Stop, stop, stop (fades out)</pre>
