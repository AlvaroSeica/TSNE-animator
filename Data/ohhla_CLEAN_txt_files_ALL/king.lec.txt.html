[Lecrae]
Yeah okay, see uhh
It's a lot of cats goin around talkin 'bout they the king
y'know what I'm sayin, the king of this the king of that
Well I think we need to get this straight
There's only one true king
Ay Flame come help ya boy out man
Let's get into this one man yeah

[Lecrae]
He was raised up in Nazareth and raised on the THIZZERD
Never got drunk, got high, or sipped SYZZURP
Prophecy King Isaiah 9 that's the WIZZORD
He's da real king and it don't matter what ya hIZZERD
The king's a real shepard dawg acts in peoples favor ya'll
Not a self seekin playa all about the paper dawg
Call em the Messiah, the annointed one the Savior, bruh
Caught him on the humble but you'll see him reign later bruh
These self proclaimed kings braggin cause they ON CHROME
But twenty sixes inches is a PRETTY LOW THRONE
Like kids playin in they daddy's clothes when he's gone
The clothes don't fit, and daddy's comin back home
Really this is foolish mayn you don't wanna do this mayn
The king of kings is comin back, the theocratic ruler mayn
What if you should pass away and see him on the last of days
There ain't no making deals so really what is there you have to say

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
WHO DA KANG? (HE DA KANG) WHO DA KANG? (HE DA KANG)
WHO DA KANG? (HE DA KANG, JESUS CHRIST RULE DIS THANG!)
WHO DA KANG? (HE DA KANG) WHO DA KANG? (HE DA KANG)
WHO DA KANG? (JESUS CHRIST RUN IT MAYNE!)

[Lecrae]
We talkin bout the sovereign ruler dawg
Ay Flame man, why don't you enlighten us to who the king is dawg?
Let's get it

[Flame]
Oh how excellent is his essence we reverence his name (ooh)
While silly peasants we presently tryna steal his fame
You carry 45s AKs king of the tools
But you can't make a day
You can't take away from da king of the Jews
See what about the major day
When you face to face with yes you know who
We wanna be a king with bling and do major things
But he supremely rules
You must be jokin you smokin plus u buyin that buddha (ooh)
Why defy him when you can rely on the lion of judah?
Supreme ruler shinin brighter than jacob the jeweler's (ooh)
Jewelry, cause it's true indeed he's savin us through the
Cross of christ and that's true
Follow him lose ya life and that's true
Gain new life, ya got to let loose
Of your own throne and follow Jesus
Rollin big whips don't make you no king
Rollin them spliffs don't make you no king
Pretty mixed screens don't make you no king
Smokin those kis don't make you no king
See you can run a trap own a house and smoke black and milds (ooh)
You'll be a king when you can do things like roll back the clouds (ooh)

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
Yeah we talkin bout absolute sovereignty
Who rules over the earth and it's entirety
Who will be back to reign!
Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess
Jesus Christ is king of the kings
Yeah, respect it</pre>
