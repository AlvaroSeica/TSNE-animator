[Chorus 2X: Imogen Heap "Speeding Cars" sample]
"There there baby, it's just textbook stuff
 It's in the ABC of growing up"

[XV]
Yeah, three women raised me, Famous Footwear paid me
Not enough to blow up, but showed up cause I ain't fucking lazy
And teachers thought I was dumb or crazy, or both
With hopes of being a Nas or Jay-Z, I slumped
in my chair and my grades, my hair wasn't waves
Being fly was priority to the lowest
I would stand on my desk just to see the world in a different way
The Dead Society of a Poet, homie I'm focussed
But that's something that a dude can't prove
I mean fam, I was damn near invisible at school
So I banged for a minute cause all my niggas was Cripping
Just me and two of my dudes, blue man crew
Had dreams of doing things they say that you can't do
cause everything ain't black and white 'less you chew bamboo
So I was after big bills like a toucan do
All the while my mom asking why I'm truant at school, she said

[Chorus 2X]

[XV]
Yeah, uh, so why ain't I go college?
My momma's ultimatum made me say that I know I got it
My niggas said, V's bugging
Stay on your computer software debugging, but we holding hardware cause we thugging
Now they in the trap house with some guns that they done borrowed
and all this snow/Aldis Snow, I call it "Infant Sorrow"
With plans to reach the end even if I had to start slow
Sold CDs in the mall, making dough like Sbarro
Then I left the hood like, fuck it, don't need the cargo
They banking I don't do "Well", and I don't mean Fargo
But even when you leave, somehow it still try to follow
Baby brother took a charge harder than LeBron and Rondo
Tryna keep his head up while his eyes are in the Bible
cause they a mind that's idle is a Devil's toy aisle
My nephew looking at me cause his daddy is his idol
I looked at him, told him sit down, this information is vital, look

[Chorus 2X]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Living my life like I'm living right
In the midst of a fire pit, the gangbanging and violence
is the sweetest song, and I roam with the heart of a violin
Don't violate my patience, I'm waiting, to kill a man
As I stare at the ceiling fan, as a fan of these wicked streets
If I gotta eat, I steal/steel like a metal piece
I'm screaming out, fuck the police, I'm dealing my cards with jokers on 'em
You can disown him or stone him, I'm throwing them rocks back
with the fury of bullets, you couldn't live your life for the moment
when I'm foaming at the mouth and my sharpest of teeth showing
I'm in the back of a black Buick, finna black out
like February, ain't that's how blacks do it, right?
I cut off my ears before I hear your advice and vice versa
I'm screaming for help as loud as I can, but that's not working
I'm working them corners like blueprints, then caught an L on my first offence
The judge threw the book at me, then said this

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
