[Intro: JoJo Pellegrino]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What what what what what what what
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

[JoJo Pellegrino]
I been down and out for a minute, low on digits
surrounded by bullshitters doin' horrible business
Loud folded, Violator's violating is vicious
Thought I'd sign to the big boys cut a fine out the midgets
Duke's diggin' his own grave, had it and lost it
What you expect from a sell-out out the hood who turns corporate?
That's right I'm talkin', my lawyers is on the job
so quit shoppin' my shit, 90 days I'm walkin'
Sucks to be the kid right now
that's why I'm in this Flipmode
Go ask Busta what it is right now
And your GM and Stool-Pigeon faggot, givin' out info'
That's why they all fired him and threw his shit out the window
He watched me starve when I was outta the loot
That's why I never defend you
when heads diss ya like "He's outta the loot!"
This ain't beef, I ain't gotta pull a tec' from my waist
You on breach, I jus' wanna see that egg on ya face
I brought you the hits, you sold me the dreams
talkin' 'bout you pressin' wax
knew you was frontin' when wifey handed you DATs
I'm tryin' to put my album on the shelf
My joint's a classic, so how the fuck you put my album on the shelf?
Need to start plannin' ya wealth
Know the reason ya artists be bouncin'?
'Cos Mo, frankly you couldn't manage yourself
And there ain't nuttin' you can do or say to patch things up
Already got this next deal about to wrap things up
You in the the past, ruin ya future, pack things up
I bet you wishin' you could back things up
This industry scary, snakes slither, rats link up
And hot swine'll tap things up like that's what's up
Don't disrespect me, we can clap things up
I'm from Staten Island where cats be gettin' cash brinked up
And I figured it out
Italian rap in the street spittin' heat and got the hood support bad news, keep him out
That's what it feels like</pre>
