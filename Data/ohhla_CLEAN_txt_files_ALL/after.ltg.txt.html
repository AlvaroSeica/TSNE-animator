That's what i'm after tell me what i'm after
(I'm after the gold then after that the platnium -----&gt; Redman
(Repeat 4x)

(Mr.Funky)

Once again it's the real ill microphone enhancer
smoking mc's till i'm down from blunt enter
the mase is in my hand but i'm not afraid to shoot ya
nobody can see me high in da future
so you know that no one can ever hurt me 
because i'm ill 
(like what)
like herpies
and I really don't give a damn who you are
Mr.Funky man all hail i'm da funkular
now in 1985 when the funk started to rock
tryin to do the human beatbox like
(BOOM HAH HAH BOOM BOOM HAH HAH)
all up in da place you can spit in yo face
then when da beatbox start play
that's when I started rocking mic's
make you wack mc's wanna fight
because they alwayas try to battle Just to see who is da best
To see who is da best 
so you know I have to roll on the quest
for what i'm after

(Course)

(I'm after the gold then after that the platnium)
Hip hop and props that's what what i'm after
(I'm after the gold then after that the platnium)
Stacks of those plaq's that's what were after
(Repeat)

(DOITALL)

If it's hip hop that makes yo knees knock
turn us up box 
I know you peep da sound it's the lords on the block
it's da list now this is how I live now
making people get down to my funky sound
ever since I heard the sound I wanted to be down
here's my demo tape wont you please pass it down
so I can get paid and have thing's like I said
a car, a yacht, a house with a maid 
but wow! slow down the party ain't that easy
oh my god I think I let that video dicive me
no matter as long as the rhymes are the phatter
I bet yo billboard has me top of da ladder
publishing like loving, I learded that from my cousin
write you on tour you'll see thousands like the dozens
and after all dat if yo games phat
all I want to see is da golden platnium plaq

(Course)

(Lord Jazz scrathes for a while)

(Mr.Funky)

Now it's 1995
and I finally got my foot in da door 
got props I want more 
cause i'm definitly not where I used to be 
but i'm no where near where I wanna be
I wanna be able to go out and buy a golf range 
and still walk away with change
until then there's no time to be wasting 
so I gotta keep on chasing

(DOITALL)

Well!!! what i'm after that's simple 
come on and peep the mental 
this ghetto born kid blowin up on instrumentals
what's the matter oh I know you can't peep my pattern
my style is desined to shed light like a lantern
click click click now the light's directly on yo ear
if you peep da sound then run go tell a peer
what happined did you get locked by my rappin 
you had to cause gold and the plat is what i'm after
