One, two, three, four!

[Andy Cooper + Dizzy Dustin]
Audacity! Audacity!

[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin)
Audacity (That's the term of the day)
Pertaining to the way a kind of person behaves
(A description) Hmmm, how would you word it?
(Maybe it's guts or just being assertive)
You can spot 'em in any walk of life
(From the prophet type) to your boss or wife
(And maybe they're vain and plain narcissistic)
but equipped with enough heart to risk it
(Coming across a bit bold or arrogant)
But when they leave we wanna know where they went
(So we can cry, The nerve of that guy,)
(but with envy cause) we're uncertain and shy
(Just wishing to succeed, we run to the well)
While he's got everyone under his spell
(Like a hard narcotic has an addict hooked)
Or a bad car crash where you have to look
They're unconfused, sharing their views
(While you just shrug) and stare at your shoes
And say "What's he got that I don't got?"
Hmmm, let me take a shot

[Chorus]
Audacity, it has to be
Audacity, it has to be
Audacity, it has to be
Audacity, it has to be
Einstein, show audacity

"It's all in the mind, if you know what I mean!" 

[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin)
Audacious, may be what it takes to make it
(To stand out) from a crowd of blank faces
(Save the caution and common sense)
Stand on the fence (You need confidence)
To be an icon (what) (and do the big interview)
When the mics on (everybody's into you)
Hitting the heights, your name up in the bright lights
(Your buying front row seats at the prize fights)
Rich and famous movin up the a-list
(Night clubs,) shows, (Boob jobs, and face lifts)
Gold teeth, (clothes) diamond studded bracelets
(Lawyers) calling everybody a racist
They're not afraid to be exposed or dismissed
(Like big chicks with rolls who wear midriffs)
And they appall you (Cause they have the gall to)
Do the little things that they all do (who?)
Rasputin, (Warhol,) St. Paul, (Jefferson)
L. Ron Hubbard, (Thomas A. Edison)
Satchmo, (Kool Herc) Godfather used to say "Pass the peas!"
What did they have, Audacity!

[Chorus]
Audacity, it has to be
Audacity, it has to be
Audacity, it has to be
Audacity, it has to be

[Andy Cooper]
On stage, I sometimes wonder why the crowd doesn't laugh at me
Maybe I got audacity
It has to be, audacity
You can't spell it without U-D!
Audacity! It has to be!
You say how you gonna go and save the best loop
for last on the beat, that's Einstein's audacity

(*DJ Young Einstein scratches and cuts a bunch of lines*)

"What's the name of this song?"
Audacity!
Audacity!
Audacity!
Audacity!

"And if you don't like it, you got to deal with it!"
"Calling upon the voices of some of the men whose names have become legends--"
"and I start with myself..."</pre>
