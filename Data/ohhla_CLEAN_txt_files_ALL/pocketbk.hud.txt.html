[Jennifer Hudson - Intro]
Don't make me hit you wit my pocketbook..
Say it again? Oh..
Don't make me hit you wit my pocketbook!

[Verse 1ne]
Lookin at my body, I betcha thankin 'bout it
Don't ya wanna know how I get down? (Uhh..)
Take a number baby, you ain't the 
only brother tryna get up under my skirt now (Uhh...)
(Rockin all your hot shit - stuntin)
(Thinkin that you're God's gift - to women)
...More like a buzz in my ear
Please shoo, fly, don't BOTHER me

[Pre-Hook]
I got my HAIR in a pony-tail, and they on me
TRUST me I can get 'em off!
They say I STRIDE like a model, curves like a bottle 
Watch me as I hit the wall, and I make 'em say 

[Chorus]
(Oooooh-waaaah-oooooh-waaaaaah-oooh) - Don't make me hit you wit my pocketbook...

[Verse 2wo]
(Ahhh, ohh..) Tell yo' baby daddy he ain't holdin no weight 
'Cause he got cake and no knife 
(Ahhh-ahhh-AHHH-ahh) Ain't nobody cuttin 
So cut it out, cut it out, al-right 
(So you don't know my face now - got it) 
(Looking at me from the waist down - stop it!) 
Said I'm a hard pill to swallow, fella 
But I can make you FEEL BETTER!

[Ludacris - Rap Verse]
Befo' I make you too WHAT?! Girl, you know you want it
Your body's nice but - ehh! You need some Luda on it
So find a mattress so we can start JUKIN on it
Movin on it baby 'cause tonight's the night
For you to rock up on the mic, 'cause I rocks the mic - RIIIIIGHT!
It's 'Cris +Mindfreak+ in the back of the Rolls
I know magic - POOF! Do away with your clothes
Then c'mere and let Luda give that body a rub
'Cause DAAAYUM lil' mama, you THICK as a mug
Just how dem Southern boys like it
Hurry up and give me a punch, I might spike it
Party in my BAPES and yes you're inna-vited
So we can make a wet scene
and win a Oscar, all up in your best +Dream+
Girl, I think you know you're drivin me crazy
They +Jinglin Baby+ - go 'head baby
With two hams in your pants, girl I think youse a CROOK
Let me touch what's up under tha-  (Don't make me hit you wit my pocketbook..)
