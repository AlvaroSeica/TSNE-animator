Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Santigold]
This time, I'll comfort
I saw you standing
And I am by your cage
I think you should wait now
I can hear you calling
I'm reaching you my hand
I can hear you now
I can hear you calling

[Chorus]
And I say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Won't you calm down? Won't you calm down?
And I say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey now
Won't you calm down? Won't you calm down?
This isn't our parade

[Santigold]
This time all we heard
For all our blending
I bridled all my rage
You won't make me bow down
And I hear you calling
No you won't understand
But I'm near you now
I can see you falling

[Chorus]

[Santigold: repeat 2X]
Hey hey hey hey ya

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
This isn't our parade </pre>
