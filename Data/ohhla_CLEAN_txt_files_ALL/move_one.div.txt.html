Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Wrong
Since you don't wanna hear my voice, just hear my song
Now all I need from you is to fix your attitude
So we can move on
Then we can move on

[Verse 1]
She was mad at first, she ain't mad no more
I guess I changed her mind when I opened that door
You know it's hard to ignore tear drops on the floor
At least I know right now that she loves me to the core
She let's me in, I confessed my sins
She unzips my pants, now we back to the norm
This is what lovers do
All my niggas can relate, they got mothers too
And I can't tell you shit cause I'm as stubborn as you
So my best bet is to stop fucking with you
But, that ain't right
And if you can't forgive me then that ain't nice
Man, I tried, I tried, I try

[Chorus]
I tried, I tried, I tried to not do you wrong
Since you don't wanna hear my voice, just hear my song
Now all I need from you is to fix your attitude
So we can move on
Then we can move on

[Verse 2]
I said she's three times a lady, three types of crazy
Rick James superfreak, three times daily
Don't wanna see your eyes make the beat cry, baby
Morning after can't find my Levis, baby
Breath stinkin' in my draws had to beat down your walls
A night of liquor you forget what all the shoutin's for
Intentions pure so I swear it's not the alcohol
These the type of things Sting wrote ballads on
Oh, you heated now? I'm a get my gallop on
Never was the one that you could put that saddle on
Tryin' to take you down, you tryin' to get your battle on
It's too much drama, get your actin' on
Move On

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I can't seem to lose you
My mind keeps racing
Cause you I keep chasing
I'm trying to be patient
I'm trying to be cool
But cool warms to heat
And heat starts burning
And heat starts turning into sleet
My mind plays repeat on the moments that we shared
It was deep, it was you, it was we, it was sweet
Now it's bitter cause you're gone 'til the Winter
[?] best it's too long 'til November
Somersaults, no love is lost, I hope
Cause I'm swinging for the knockout but you got me by the ropes
Put me on a necklace, girl you got me by the throat
Quit playin' with my heart baby, you got me 'bout to choke
I write this then I smoke, maybe you'll appear
Sooner than later my dear
Maybe this year</pre>
