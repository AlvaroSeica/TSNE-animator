[Z-Ro]
Let me ask you something, why you spend all your time worried about me
Cause I'm smoking drinking, and getting paid
And you're still, doing bad without me
I know you don't wanna see me shining, I know you wanna have what I got
But I've been hustling, handling my buisness
It's my time, whether you like it or not
Just stay the hell, out my way
I'll sacrifice my freedom today
Cause I will blow you away
But since, you're the reason I'm getting paid
 
[Hook]
I'd really like to thank you
Because without your H-A-T-E, I couldn't be me
I'd like to thank you
You're the reason, I made it to the T-O-P
I'd really like to thank you
Even though I'm not on TV, I'm just another c.d.
I'd like to thank you
You're the reason, my bank account is bout to O.D.
 
[Z-Ro]
My mind is made up, I'm not gon' let ya talk me out of my game
Even though it gets harder during the fourth quarter, I gotta get the victory mayn
I'm a ten player when I play, so all my team got something to say
But they ain't talking about nothing, they bumping
Mad cause the MVP, is Mr. McVey
Hope they don't give me a lane, if they don't I got my three point range
Ain't nobody gotta cheer for me mayn
Don't go nowhere, cause after the game
 
[Hook]
 
[Z-Ro]
I'm a one man army, I don't need no help my nigga
Cause you's a buster, how could I love ya
The only one I trust besides myself, is my trigger
I know you haters wanna see me fall, but like Yao Ming I'm still standing tall
Even though my homeboys use to doubt me
Now they wanna out me, that's why I sing fuck all ya'll
Cause I don't want no friends, the love they have is pretend
They didn't know me, when I went to the pen
Now they telling everybody, they my next of kin
 
[Hook]
 
[Lil' Flip]
I'm thinking of a master plan
Z-Ro could get a verse for free, cause that nigga my man
We playing Texas Hold'em, watch me show em my hand
He come home from jail, fuck it I'ma throw him a grand
Now my nigga getting ten, so thangs going as planned
We dropped Kings of the South, you better check the soundscan
So when you need a tight verse, what you gon' do
Call Flipper Ro, you got my number foo'
You get in the game, and act like you better than us
But we know the truth, you ain't getting the cheddar like us
You living a lie, we know you ain't a gangsta
On the behalf of real niggaz, I have to thank ya
 
[Hook]
 
(*talking*)
God damn, did you hear what he said
He say you the reason his bank account, is bout to O.D.
Z-Ro my shit already O.D.'d fo' times, you flatlined five times
Thanks to Sony (fuck you), ya know
Thanks to the streets, you can't fuck with us man
You could steal our style, but you can't fuck with us nigga
Flip Gates Z-Ro nigga, we the kings of the South
Got a problem we cock it back, and put that thing in your mouth
Buck kill yourself (kill yourself), thank ya</pre>
