[*Are you ready? Yeah
Are you ready? 
Alright now here we go*]
 
[Chorus]
Jump (Jump Around the Place)
Jump (I Wanna Hear The Bass)
Jump (Jumpin Up And Down)
Jump (When You Hear The Sound)
Jump (Let The Music Play)
Jump (Hear My People Say)
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey
(2x)

Ayo I'm certified, bona fide
Known to fly, cross country overnight
Pullin my, shaft out my super fly
Hoppin outta stupid rides
Black Jesus crucified
Who this guy?
Coolest Mack
Black Ceasar, Dolomite
Cold as ice
Corner's light
On this side we own the night
Bringing drama 
Hot as sauna 
Where we wanna go tonight?
Head to toe the freshest dresser 
Sharp as Dracula's overbite
Warning sign 
We own this site
On this song
It's over right?

[Chorus]
Jump (Jump Around the Place)
Jump (I Wanna Hear The Bass)
Jump (Jumpin Up And Down)
Jump (When You Hear The Sound)
Jump (Let The Music Play)
Jump (Hear The People Say)
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey
(2x)

You requested it so re-wind
Me rhyme
Women make a beeline
Hoping they can be mine
Brooklyn girls come wind wind
Unwind
One time
Even in the sunshine
You can see the son shine
Crunch time
It's lunchtime
Wine punch in thee punch line
I punch in thee drum line
Soldier on the frontlines
Ruff rhymes
Nuff crimes
Under dirt or done time
Ain't my kind to waste time
So come and grind your waistline
Seen?

[Chorus]
Jump (Jump Around the Place)
Jump (I Wanna Hear The Bass)
Jump (Jumpin Up And Down)
Jump (When You Hear The Sound)
Jump (Let The Music Play)
Jump (Hear The People Say)
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey
(2x)

Check  
I step in the place
Reppin the bass
Reppin the treble
Followed by rebels
Holdin they metals
Checking the levels
And ready to bury a soundboy
I hit the stage, from out the cage
Rocksteady, ready aim 
Fire burn, light a flame
Ring the alarm
And call the brigade
Original Timbo king
For Wallabee Kangol kids
Slum hero
Bandelero
From the airhole
Give up deniro
No cigar
No guitar
Cuz I'm a action star
Say hello to my friend
And goodbye to the bad guy

[Chorus]
Jump (Jump Around the Place)
Jump (I Wanna Hear The Bass)
Jump (Jumpin Up And Down)
Jump (When You Hear The Sound)
Jump (Let The Music Play)
Jump (Hear The People Say)
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey
