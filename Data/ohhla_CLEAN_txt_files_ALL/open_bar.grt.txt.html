Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Leaning on my side, hanging onto my ride
'69 Cadillac, black on both sides
Here we go, it's open bar time
Here we go, it's open bar time
Come on
Leaning on my side, hanging onto my ride
'69 Cadillac, black on both sides
Here we go

So get you cups up, get your drink up
It's living water, baby
Get your mind in order, baby

The world is yours, you can kick it any way you want
You can be a slave forever, you can be the stump that everybody walks over
Or you can be a boulder and crush those fools like a Buffalo soldier
Yeah, Tennessee up in the house like this
and we smacking all suckers with the West Coast twist, (we yell)
Dead flow in the Cadillac, baby, the windows rolled down on the Sunset Strip
The price paid, the blood on the ground laid
We 'bout to change the game like the Bones brigade
And I'm the new Lance Mountain in some D &amp; G jeans
I'm cold chilling, baby, with the West Coast lean

No matter who you are, tonight is open bar

So get you cups up, get your drink up
It's living water, baby
Get your mind in order, baby

Leaning on my side, hanging onto my ride
'69 Cadillac, black on both sides
Here we go, it's open bar time
Here we go, it's open bar time
Come on
Leaning on my side, hanging onto my ride
'69 Cadillac, black on both sides
Here we go

So get you cups up, get your drink up
It's living water, baby
Get your mind in order, baby

The living liquid is acidic when it's going down exquisite
Revisited, I did it, live it to the triple digit
Give it, get it 'til it pivot with it
Carter said we did it
Let it eat at you, acidic
We got it 'cause we get it, did it
In a manner, planned a proper course and took it
Lead a brighter light of hope
invading games and certain that no one mistook it for a fleeting moment
On it like a vigilante group
Purchase ticket, come and see me on it like a business suit
I'm the supplying the truth, soon ample amounts of ammo
A word of caution though: never chew off more than you can handle
This is just a snippet, body ripping in the sample
Consequences, limit, ain't no gimmicks in this foxhole

No matter who you are, tonight is open bar

Propose a toast:

So get you cups up, get your drink up
It's living water, baby
Get your mind in order, baby

Leaning on my side, hanging onto my ride
'69 Cadillac, black on both sides
Here we go, it's open bar time
Here we go, it's open bar time
Come on
Leaning on my side, hanging onto my ride
'69 Cadillac, black on both sides
Here we go, it's open bar time
Here we go, it's open bar time

It's that lyrical liquid, miracle liquid
Same divine wine Jesus pickled the sick with
Healed the afflicted
Dipped, sipped and chilled with his click wit
Last supper for the label, and Grits to break bread with
A permanent link, penned with a permanent ink
Discern vessels to eternally think
For twelve years we been earning our keep, and won't stop
Shed tears for the lost souls falling asleep
They spear beers to the homies who was caught in the street
We say our prayers for the mothers who was left with the grief
Wait patiently in the night for the thief to creep
In the blink of an eye, standing at the cold of his feet
Sipping that living water, keeping my mind in order
Passing the cup dutifully, it ended up beautifully

So get you cups up, and get your drink on
It's living water, baby
Get your mind in order, baby

Leaning on my side, hanging onto my ride
'69 Cadillac, black on both sides
Here we go, it's open bar time
Here we go, it's open bar time
Come on
Leaning on my side, hanging onto my ride
'69 Cadillac, black on both sides
Here we go, it's open bar time
Here we go, it's open bar time

Get loose if you wanna get loose
'Cause we got that juice to make you choose truth
Over there they pop grits
Over there they got gooks
Over here we keep it grade-A 150 proof

No matter who you are, tonight is open bar

So get you cups up, get your drink on
It's living water, baby
Get your mind in order, baby

Leaning on my side, hanging onto my ride
'69 Cadillac, black on both sides
Here we go, it's open bar time
Here we go, it's open bar time
Come on
Leaning on my side, hanging onto my ride
'69 Cadillac, black on both sides
Here we go, it's open bar time
Here we go, it's open bar time

Get loose if you wanna get loose
'Cause we got that juice to make you choose truth
Over there they pop grits
Over there they got gooks
Over here we keep it grade-A 150 proof

No matter who you are, tonight is open bar

So get you cups up, get your drink on
It's living water, baby
Get your mind in order, baby</pre>
