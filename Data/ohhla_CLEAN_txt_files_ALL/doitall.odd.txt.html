(No good, no good)

[ CHORUS ]
I'm tryina do it all
From now on until the day that I'm gone
I think large cause the Earth is too small
For real I'm
Tryina do it all
A blank page is how it all starts off
And rhyme and the blueprint'll get drawn on
Cause I'm
Tryina do it all
Just like ( ? ) give it up or we gon' take by force
Because I'm
Tryina do it all
Without a pause and I ain't got no choice
But to do better than whenever before
Because I'm tryina do it all

[ VERSE 1: Oddisee ]
I'm tryina make the world know me, stack G's, yet be lowkey
Get paper with my brothers like the majors, but we so free
Till we sign like we don't speak
I'ma rhyme like - I'm tryina save the earth within the time I'm spinnin on it
The way my career is goin, I might get to spendin on it
Dependin on if my minutes longer than 15
I might say a verse and then end the song on a big screen
Picture that from a small town with with big dreams
From flyin coach to buyin coach, I'm in between
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I ride the subway as a car, I'm gettin by
My life is hard
Not all the time although yes I'm ready to die, ain't tryina starve
I'm on the grind from poverty to a bottom line
And my barter time concludin only with dollar signs

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: XO ]
I need change like a dollar for four quarters
I want fame, I can't lie to all my supporters
Pops wasn't around like imigration at the border
Illegal aliens gave me my alias, one saucer
We ate off the same plate, became a part of
Each other, we was movin as one cause one thought could
Change the world, Eric Clapton with the guitar
( ? ) the sun is even a dyin star
Had a couple meetings, guess we ain't poppin enough ace
Rappers incriminatin like it's no open and shut case
For no one time waits, me and my primates
Had guns like prom dates, look me in my face
Have you ever seen time stand still?
Ask yourself questions like why does man kill?
But fuck it, cause even Big Daddy Kane was Abel
So I'ma spoil my kids like the fruit Eve gave you

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: yU ]
Now peep the pattern as we movin on up the ladder
Had a dream of how we beam up, puttin the focus on what matters
Most, damn it, I hope that y'all ain't think that the ( ? )
It would never let up, never, full court press upon the ball
Buildin bridges in this rigid bidness, plus stay on our pivot
Pilin albums with a different stylin
We spit to shift the balance
The District Diamond fill up they mind with the realest of rhymin
Visions get wide when I apply it, now it's livin inside 'em
Borrowed tomorrow and gave back through my raps - our motto
Gotta let y'all know, so our steps led a path to follow
Yeah, son, bread crumbs, left two steps from the edge
Not scared, feelin prepared, that's for whenever that bread comes
Never loafin with potent, the shop's forever open
Speakers smokin with O shit to crack your windows open
And get to zonin, jonin on whoever want it
We go in on every song that we on because we tryina do it all</pre>
