[Frank Ocean]
Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet
That's the moment that I see her as she leavin
I - say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringin in, ringin in
No I don't wanna, but I gotta answer this call
Could you wait, it really won't be long
And then the kid came, told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone
How'd I get distracted I, don't know what happened I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got away away
You flew away away, ohhhh

[Chorus]
I lost my angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) I'm postin pictures of her
(And where she go?)
She got me drivin around the back streets
I thought I saw her walkin right past me
I called you, didn't answer to your name
Where's my angel? Where'd you go?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

[Frank Ocean]
No I don't wanna
And then the kid came
How'd I get distracted I, don't know what happened I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got away away
You flew away away, ohhhh

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Oh, angel, tell me what am I to do?
Angel, I can't find another you
Angel, search downtown
Now I'm on the 10 West doin 90 tryin to get to you
Exit La Cienega
I'm lookin, I'm searchin
La Brea, Santa Monica, Sunset, Sepulveda
Robertson, Melrose and Hollywood

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
