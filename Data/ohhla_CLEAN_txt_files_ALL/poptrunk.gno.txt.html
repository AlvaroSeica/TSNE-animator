(*talking*)
Let's get crunk yeah, Magno ya heard
We gon take this back to Texas
Swanging on 4's, and my neons gon glow when I

[Magno]
Pop trunk, life, recline fifth
Elbows, on a new lemon lime whip
That's why your boy, got many fine dips
Need help with ya hustle, here's a few grind tips
Go out, and promote your work
First thangs first, make sho' your flow's bizzerk
If you don't want niggaz to laugh, and hoes to squirk
You can't rap, if your flow is dirt naw homie
'Nuff of that, this is really bout my slab
Pull the top back, like I'm peeling off a scab
I feel the same way, how you feeling off of tabs
Catch me up in N.Y., chilling out with Fab'
This is Wildlife, Desert Storm South
Niggaz don't respect it, till you put them arms out
Hoes a little different, I just pull the cars out
Next thing you know, I got a nice warm mouth

[Hook]
Swanging on 4's, and my neons gon glow when I
Pop trunk, lift, recline fifth-pop trunk, lift, recline fifth
Laptops be hanging, my speakers gon bang when I
Pop trunk, lift, recline fifth-pop trunk, lift, recline fifth

[Magno]
I come through, with the bass is bumping
Let me pop trunk for Adranne Thompson, rest in peace boy
I got something, that them ladies wanting
Successful young man, born in 80-something
Ha-ha, I collect the check
And my age and the year my car was made, running neck and neck
Old school what I drive, Lacs, Caprices
Buicks, Oldsmobile, I'm bout to knock off a old Seville
Might get it, next week
Then it's all the laptops, with the Windows XP
Now a lot of bitches, wanna sex me
But that's a resort, of how a nigga wreck beats
I don't even trip, golds in my lip
Yes, no less than fo's when I sip
Two chrome spinners, new 4's on the whip
Now hoes on my dick, like they froze to my hip, Magno
