[Intro:]
Ayy ayy ayy ok ok juicy gucci juicy gucci half a brick
half a brick, zaytoven, zaytiggi
ayy ayy ayy ok ok ok ayy ayy so icey entertainment

[Chorus: x2]
Quarter Brick, half a brick
Whole brick (Aaay!)
Quarter pound, half a pound
Whole pound (Okay!)
100 pillz, 1000 pillz, servin major weight
JuiceMan and Gucci Mane make the trap (Aay)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm twerkin birds in so we workin [x3]
Packin a truck stop to train a back in
We big flip jug we tote it off the forklift
The way my plug kick ya think he had a black belt
My scale so big big boy can weigh it's damn self
2000 pounds of mid I sold dat shit my damn self
Washer full of cash dryer full of X pills
Red rag in my pocket same color my Vette is
My number lower than a ese from texas
A quarter mill' in da mail is an investment
A sniper rifle like a soldier in the desert
A eagle on me boy I'm known to tote a Desert
I sack a ounce up before I sold a record
He won't a brick I told him meet me by the Checkers
I sack a pound up before I sold a record
He want a bet I told him meet me by the Checkers

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]
I'm boomin I'm buggin I'm termin all the baits
Rap game ezy but da dope game gravy
Young juice man and my life is the japerz
With stupid fruity crazy swag jumpin in yo lader
Banana donk chevy interior like the Lakers
LeBron James wrist when I'm fuckin with Yaper
Hit the trap, stay down watch the paper wake up
Boomin out da house and J askin for a waiter
[x2:] (half a brick whole brick got me buyin jacobs bourbon shoes walkin in da head and da gators)

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: OJ Da Juiceman]
Young juice man god dammit I'm da shit [repeat till end]</pre>
