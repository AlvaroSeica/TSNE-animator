[Intro: DJ Khaled] (T-Pain)
I'm f'real about this shit! This the remix!
(Welcome to my hooooood, hee-eee) Let's go!
Where the hood at? - Remix!
Where the hood at? - Remix!
Where the hood at? - Remix!

[Chorus: T-Pain] (DJ Khaled)
Welcome to my hooooood - Everybody know everybody
And if I got it, everybody got it, uh!
Welcome to my hooooood - Look at all these old school Chevys'
24's so you know we roll heavy, uh! (Y-M-C-M-B!)
Welcome to my hooo-ooooo-oood - Where they gettin fly +Like a G6+
and everybody know this is the remix
Welcome to my hooooood - Dem boys'll put you down on your knees (Miami Dade County, 305)
WHOOP! WHOOP! That's the +Sound of Da Police+ in my hood! (We the Best Music!)

[Verse One: Ludacris]
Stop playin wit 'em! LUDA!
Everybody on the corner with the works slangin and bangin in front of that liquor sto'
Blowin money cause I live life fast, so this bottle full of 'gnac I'ma sip it slow
Singles double when triple beams take over
Now holla cause these Impalas got extreme makeovers (WOO!)
Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the street, now
Wear the wrong color catch a Rodney King, beatdown!
Kids hit with switches, mommas is quotin scriptures
While Luda's gettin head, mo' gums than baby pictures (WOO!)
Cock my 40-Glock and my partner just bought a replica
Now Asians sayin they don't keep no cash in they register (hurry up and buy!)
We run from red and blue LIGHTS to get the green
But whoever got that WHITE, is "winnin" like Charlie Sheen!

[Verse Two: T-Pain]
HEY! Teddy Pain! (Teddy Pain!) Bad man! (Bad man!)
Mix shots - BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM bang!
Man +We the Best+ nevertheless, you know we get it hot!
FIRE flame flame FIRE FIRE flame!
Put me on the track and I'ma really let a muh'fucker feel it
when I do it how I do it what I do
If a nigga really wanna test (come and test)
you can bet that I'ma eat him all day - FUCK FOOD!
8-5-0 what I represent (sent) Talla-home Florida president
Me and DJ Khaled got these haters lookin hesitant (yeah)
So keep all of that wackness out my EAR
(BYOO, BYOO) That's the sound of yo' CAREER
in my hooooood..

[Verse Three: Busta Rhymes]
{*Bell Rings*} I hope you niggas got your ringside seats!!!
'Cause it's whoop ass season
(COMIN TO A HOOD NEAR YOU!!!)
Everybody know what happen when you see me comin (BACK UP!!!!!!)
I be hurdlin then got you regurgitatin and murderin everything (GUNSHOT)
(BAP BAP BAP BAP BAP BAP BAP BAP!!!!!)
(Y'ALL KNOW WHAT IT IS!!!) I'm comin to get it in
Enough of the block and I'm runnin the hood and nothin can top it
You could Google it or you could search on how a nigga come and
Lock up impossible for you to stop it!!!!
(MORE FIRE DUN DI PLACE!!!!)
Blackout and heat di bed yuh know a ease di dread
I probably need di medical situation
because the way I'm fuckin everything I tell di people dem!!!
Why you try to do when you already know I'm the king with it
And you don't wanna come behind me with it bro
I KILLED THIS SHIT!!! I AIN'T GOTTA RHYME NO MO'!!!!

[Verse Four: Twista] (T-Pain) (*Twista Adlibs) (**Mavado)
(WELCOME TO MY HOOD!!!!) Welcome to my hood where board members of faculty
Backin me if you ever try and tackle me
That could be when I eat 'em especially when I beat 'em
When you see a bunch of killers and hustlers on the side of me
I'm an anomaly to 'em, put 'em on crutches for suckin their verses
Such as the one that's kickin a ruckus
Much as I smoke a dutchess and model bitches that cut us
And motherfuckers and lovers and enemies wanna touch us
I'ma spit a flow as if it was a sin (*WHAT!)
Then the gangstas are best with me forever
see I find a fo' put in on a pen (**Ayyyyyyy!!!)
Then you know to never test with me it'll be a +Category F5+
(**ANYWAAAAAYYYYYYYYY!!!!)
Let 'em in the military with automatic weapons so let's ride
Love to the hunters and everybody that runnin them north
and the whole city comin from the Westside!!!
(**WHAPPEN TO DEM!!!!)

[Verse Five: Mavado] (T-Pain)
Come to di Gully weh we nuh tek baddup
Big spliff inna mi hand and Hennessy inna mi cup
Yuh see di gal weh we have up it's like some angels a duck
Dem phat and grab up! Yah hear mi!!!
Ha Ha!!! When yuh pass di gate, greet mi at di entrance
Violate, straight death sentence
Yuh live yuh must be great to be a snake nuh repentance
We comin at yuh wid vengeance
(WELCOME TO MY HOOD!!!!)

[Verse Six: DJ Khaled]
Never slippin, I'm ballin, Puff keep on callin
I don't see none of you pussies (I ain't tryna hear that shit!)
Fuck that shit groupie talkin
Rep Miami the ghetto (Dade County), every hood and the projects
And when I drop off my singles, I'm droppin one of my targets
Lord forgive me for my siiiiins
I gave you hits, I gave you "All I Do is Wiiiin" (I won't stop)
I live this shit and We the Best it's no preteeeend
I'm touchin millions, throwin hundreds in this biiiiiiitch!

[Verse Seven: Birdman]
Yeah, Uptown
Swagged out, let's get it (Ah-AH! Ah-AH!)
R-Real nigga #1, hustle fly with my son

Red flag everyday, hundred mil' ready to spray
Swagged out nigga, Bugatti with the paper plate
B-B-Blowin on some good, nigga (on some good, nigga)

You understand? Shinin like I know we should
Birdman YMCMB, we good nigga!

[Verse Eight: Ace Hood]
(Brownwaaaay!)
A-A-Ace Hood in this bitch hoe, kickin down in yo' front door
Knock knock, you hear the Glock cock and that thing pop on that fo-fo' (BR-R-R-RAT!)
Posted on in that same block, I'm in the drop top with that bank roll
Y-Young nigga, I'm out chea, cain't name a place that I cain't go
Ridin 'round with 'bout 50 grand and they wonder what do that safe hold
Middle fanger them feds and that's what I pledge a part of my G-code
Man, FUCK them prosecutors, hustla connoisseur
'Cause +We the Best Forever+, make sure you spread the rumor bitch~!

[Verse Nine: Fat Joe] (T-Pain)
(WELCOME TO MY HOOD!!!)
Cooked coke, hard rock, stashed in the body shop
Only way to break them bricks down is karate chops
Niggaz gettin left right in front of the marble precinct
Leave 'em like them Jordans' - red dot, leakin
I'm fifteen when I first started coppin pies
You forty-six just turnin Blood, stop it five
It's like the only way to make it is supplyin things
Hoop dreams dunkin over cars, let the choir sing

[Verse Ten: The Game] (T-Pain)
(WELCOME TO MY HOOD!!!)
Yo it's that black raw, black dawg, pullin up on that black hog
Compton that's my backyard, that's where I used to get them sacks off
But now I got platinum plaques
in the back of the back and I'm back with Dre again
Aftermath, We the Best, me and Khaled, Dre and Em
"Detox", "RED" - that's back to the back, step in the club with my hat to the back
Nigga I'm so hood even though I'm livin good
niggaz still in the V.I.P. strapped with a gat
Drop a couple stacks then it's back to the trap
couple hoes in the back, red wheels on the 'llac
Redrum if you try niggaz, Westside! Throw it up, now!

[Verse Eleven: Jadakiss] (*T-Pain)
(*WELCOME TO MY HOOD!!!)
They knockin packs off (off) they lettin gats off (off)
Medicaid, benefit card, scratch-offs
Savin every dime (yeah) tryin to choke a quarter
And they ain't sellin crack (nah) they sellin Coke and water
Smokin or you snortin, they coppin all the Jordans (yeah)
Nothin's more important, steal 'em if you can't afford 'em (yep)
I'm gettin to the money (money) I need another comma
Some of 'em love the drama (yeah) more than they love they momma

[Verse Twelve: Bun B] (T-Pain)
(WELCOME TO MY HOOD!!!)
Yeah, welcome to the land of the Trill
where everybody walkin with they hand on the steel
And the model is a supply and demand and he will
you been outta line with the wrong man and get killed
Where you damned if you will, damned if you won't
lot of dudes sayin that they can when they don't
And a lot of boys sayin that they G's but they ain't
mess around get laid down in the paint
Better do what you say, say what you do
'fore I come around your hood broad day with the crew
They got them fists, A-R's, AK's and them twos
and they will gladiate all day, what it do? (What it do?)
R.I.P. to the trillest that did it, to my G's on lockdown acquitted
Think I'ma stop reppin P.A.T.? Forget it! (get it, get it)

[Verse Thirteen: Waka Flocka Flame]
(RIVER-DALLLLLLLLE~!!! WAKA! FLOCKA! WAKA! FLOCKA!)
Welcome to Clayton County, my house got surrounded
The enemies tryna drown me, but my hood still around me (RIVERDAAAAALE!!!)
Rookie of the year, no "Freshman" cover
Shawty sixteen years old, with FO' baby mothers!!
First rapper ever to jump off the stage on BET (Uh-huh!)
And since Pac, go to Hollywood and keep it street (WEEEEST-SIIIIDE, UH!!)
First Wooh to put T. Rodgers on the TV
Everyday it's a party on Grove Street
