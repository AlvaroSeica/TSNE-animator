[Intro: T.I.]
I'm only, I'm only human dawg
I'm only human dawg {*3X*}
Ay, ay listen to me

[Interlude: Chris Brown]
Hello, out there
Can you, hear me?
It's an S.O.S.
To let me, be me

[Chorus: T.I.] + (Chris Brown)
Ay when they push you down you got to (get back up) I'm only human y'all
Ay when they push you down you got to (get back up) I'm just a human y'all
Push the dirt, off your jersey then go for the cup
Or the trophy, or the ring, champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt, and the ring
People with you poppin bottles, takin pictures, look around
But soon as you fall down all the haters passin judgment (ohh no no)
Fly as I'm is shawty I'ma rise above this (ohh no no no no)

[T.I.]
Hey what it is world? Yeah it's me again
Back before you, at your mercy, on bended knee again
No runnin from the truth, as much as we pretend
that it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends (I'm sorry)
for lettin you down, I won't take you down this road again (uh-uh)
Most of you now sayin "Whatever, here we go again"
Blogs, radio and television all goin in
I laugh to keep from cryin through all of the embarrassment (I gotta say)
I gotta say you fuckin haters is hilarious (ha ha)
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou?
Point your finger now with me lookin down (down)
Same clown that was TwitPic'in at my weddin
On the same Twitter page disrespectin, wait a second (hold up~!)
Never mind my imperfections, this a fact, remember that
No mistake's too great to recover and bounce back

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
I admit, yeah I done some dumb shit, disappointed e'rybody I know
Try not to hold that against me though
My road to redemption has no GPS
So guess that time must be invested for this to be manifested
Yes it's, hard livin life in the spotlight
Tryin to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
The Bible say "Let he without sin cast the stone first" (stone first)
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?
Yea he go to work, never done no drugs up until the Fed
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead (damn)
Difference is my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to TMZ, the AJC and Wikipedia
See the stairway to heaven while steppin down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God ain't that what really matter? (nope)
And matter fact, I'm wrong but after that
The good I done in yo' hood, should it over-shadow that?
Got the world laughin at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with, even if you're so legit
that you get a house with a dog and a picket fence
The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this

[Chorus]

[Interlude] - 3X w/ Chris Brown ad libs

[T.I. - over Interlude]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I'm only human dawg
Ay, I'm only human dawg
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay you can love me, or either leave me
Before you judge me, just let me be me
Ay you can love me, or either leave me
Before you judge me, see life ain't easy
Yeah, you gon' miss me when I'm gone
I know when I'm gone, I bet you gon' miss me when I'm gone
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Hmm, you gon' miss me when I'm gone
I know when I'm gone, I bet you gon' miss me when I'm gone
You gon' miss me when I'm gone

I accept full responsibility for all the wrong I've done
If y'all thought I was perfect
I apologize for bein human man
But never again partner
You could put my life on that

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[T.I. - over Interlude]

Ay you can love me, or either leave me
Before you judge me, see life ain't easy</pre>
