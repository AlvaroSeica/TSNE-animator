[Intro]
You wanna talk to the people you gotta talk to 'em on some shit like this
Gimme a minute I just wanna vent, I want a mortgage I don't wanna rent
I got a Benz now I want a Bent, I need a come up like a fuckin tent

[Verse One]
One time for the hood that's where I'm comin from
Dope deals nine meals and I ain't judgin nothin
Get your money and respect all at the same time
Multitask focus all over the same problems
Criminal mind go to school or go out and mob
I know people with they diploma who ain't got a job
Times get hard if you let it, I sell soft I don't sweat it
Hope I never regret it, but bein broke I've had it
Fuck that, I need more out of life
I'm a get it with the white, or get it with what I write
It ain't right, but it's wrong, to be lyin in these songs
Though I don't, 'cause I can't, wait a minute let me vent
Man these fake niggas all talkin shit, that ain't real
I just do, what I do, and I hustle in my field
Stay the fuck up out my lane steal my joy bring you pain
All these rappers just the same is it me? or that's lame?
I'm just sayin

[Chorus]
Gimme a minute I just wanna vent, I want a mortgage I don't wanna rent
I got a Benz now I want a Bent, I need a come up like a fuckin tent
So I'm speedin, right now as I'm breathin
Don't know when I'm leavin, tomorrow ain't begin
'Til I open my eyes grind time mother Pearl
I be out here tryin to get it it's just me against the world baby
Gimme a minute I just wanna vent, I want a mortgage I don't wanna rent
I got a Benz now I want a Bent, I need a come up like a fuckin tent
So I'm speedin, right now as I'm breathin
Don't know when I'm leavin, tomorrow ain't begin
'Til I open my eyes grind time mother Pearl
I be out here tryin to get it it's just me against the world baby

[Verse Two]
I remember bein broke twice in my life
Couldn't pay my rent couldn't bail all my light
Cold showers full of presence what I'm goin through
Move in with my ex or back to mom dukes
How I'm a look to my lil' brother and sister damn
What if she look through my phone and start to bitch again
Big bro broke I could follow in strafe
Sell cold dope throughout extremes tight bags
Livin off others eventually comes to a end
Now you lost in this world then you done lost a friend 
That ain't no way to be, can't respect those who do
I ain't a crippled up kid so I got up to do
What had to be done, haters wish I would fold
The only thing I drop is jewels here's somethin to you all
You could live within your means you ain't gotta ball
Most the people that you impressin don't got shit at all

[Chorus]
Gimme a minute I just wanna vent, I want a mortgage I don't wanna rent
I got a Benz now I want a Bent, I need a come up like a fuckin tent
So I'm speedin, right now as I'm breathin
Don't know when I'm leavin, tomorrow ain't begin
'Til I open my eyes grind time mother Pearl
I be out here tryin to get it it's just me against the world baby
Gimme a minute I just wanna vent, I want a mortgage I don't wanna rent
I got a Benz now I want a Bent, I need a come up like a fuckin tent
So I'm speedin, right now as I'm breathin
Don't know when I'm leavin, tomorrow ain't begin
'Til I open my eyes grind time mother Pearl
I be out here tryin to get it it's just me against the world baby

[Outro: Female]
Gimme a minute yeah, yeah, I want it, I need it, and I want it it it
You could be what you wanna be, go where you wanna go
And do what you wanna do, don't let nobody tell you no
You could be what you wanna be, go where you wanna go
Don't let nobody tell you no!!! Oooh! Yeah yeah!
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah! Oh! 
Be, yeah yeah yeah yeah well!</pre>
