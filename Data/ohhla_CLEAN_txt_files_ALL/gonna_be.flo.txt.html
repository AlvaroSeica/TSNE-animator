Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Brer Rabbit]
Yeah I'm a believer, I won't be beleaguered
I give a damn, no Leave it to Beaver
With the R-E-S-P-E-C-T like Aretha
And if I don't use my feet then I won't have that either
Yes we serve, we deserve some peace
And we serve the least versed to reverse
The deep hurt that's featured
Each turn of the sheet of a learned history
Like Wall Street, the Trail of Tears and the War in the Philippines
And I wash my hands clean like surgeons in emergencies
Median on weed like conjoinment and Glucosamines
Relap the joint and wound the knee
Let's Deco the Negro
And be like Steve Bico, we're not hearing a beat
From the projects like [?] and research
We're jumping in feet-first
Reaction more than knee-jerk
Don't let his story recur
Swipe [?] like a Visa
A fire doesn't need a sinkhole
Just the silence of the people

[Chorus (x2)]
As for me, I'm gonna be free
I'm gonna be free from all of this history
Yeah, me, I'm gonna be free, I'm gonna be free

[Verse 2: Jonny 5]
I rhyme post-post-ironic flows (homo)
I came to fuck shut up, homos
Stonewall, laugh at that, no no
Don't y'all assume that I'm straight
Cause you don't know
I'm close to the edge like Bono
Won't fall victim to the Gordian Knot
Trying to sort again rock mine
For the win
Plot lines are stretched like accordion
To Resurrect, born again, in division
[?]
Free from all the history
Beef with salt and misery
Just how it should be for y'all and is for me
That's the truth, blppppp as bald as
Mr. Clean, spit it like Listerine
'Till my lips are stinging hot, scalding, blistering
I'm composting primitive thoughts
And prayers what we want most
[?] lock the prison with God's forgiveness
It's it a bunch of [?]
Holy ghost, high hopes
Touchdown like Broncos
The song goes on like ponchos

[Chorus (x2)]
As for me, I'm gonna be free
I'm gonna be free from all of this history
Yeah, me, I'm gonna be free, I'm gonna be free

And if we can start a riot (well what can we really do?)
If we can tear a city down (what can we really do?)
Crush enemies, cause casualties
If we can start a movement
If we can lift a city up
If we can heal the wounded
Feed our families, face history

[Chorus (x4)]
As for me, I'm gonna be free
I'm gonna be free from all of this history
Yeah, me, I'm gonna be free, I'm gonna be free</pre>
