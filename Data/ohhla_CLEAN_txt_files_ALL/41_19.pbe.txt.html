I come out my crib
Walk out on the block it¹s hot
Yo there¹s a black car parked on the corner hot boys
Tnt be creepin, while niggas be on the side
Of the soda machine sleeping
Word up kid, they seen what you did 
In the car parked way down the block with binoculars 
That¹s what they got.
Helicopters parked out on the roof
10,000 disposable cameras taking pictures for proof
You know what this is
That all y'all, get on the wall y'all
Take your worth out ya ass in the stall y'all
Or you take a mean bad fall y'all
Tnt they be playin for keeps
Wipe you off your teeth like cavity creep.

Word is born, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?

Yo it¹s hot, what they got, 41 shots

Bad boys bad boys what ya gonna do
If you get caught by our muthafuckin crew
Shot 41 only hit 19
They need target practice, that¹s what it seems to me
Ally al is sharpton dan a tack
I¹ma be like ally al and fight ya back
What, do you want to go to war, you want war?
Do you want to go to war, you want war?
I¹ll bury all you cocka la roaches for breakfast
Shit you out and throw you in the water for the next fish
Cuz i can do that shit g
F-l-a-v-o-r f-l-a-v  see.
To the highest degree times 3
That¹s what you get fuckin with my family

Word is born, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?

Yo it¹s hot, what they got, 41 shots

Shootin at oj
Don¹t know if he did it
Racist mutherfuckers mad cause they ain¹t with it
The police get out the car searchin for nuthin
If you got sumthin, then they got you for sumthin
That¹s fucked up, the way they play dirty
Lock em up in jail until he¹s past thirty
They don¹t give a fuck about you
They don¹t give a fuck about me
I¹m past thirty three
Word is born, born is my word
I got you before my word fails
Fuck whatcha heard
I keep it real, you never catch me fakin
When it comes down to money that¹s what i¹m making
Don¹t try and take my shit yo, i know lex yo
I¹ll have a fit yo
I¹ll turn the whole mutherfuckin block on you yo
And that leaves you with nowhere to go
Secretly by the police you was hired
You my favorite customer i didn¹t know you was wired
A nik on the ground, covered by my feet
Ay yo rah get the heat

Word is born, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?

Yo it¹s hot, what they got, 41 shots
