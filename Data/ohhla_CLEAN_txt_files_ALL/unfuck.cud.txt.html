Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no questionin', ain't no conspiracy
Keep on searching for love, who else is incomplete?
There's so many good vibes just floating around in the world
And when the ground and sky combine, I'm feeling more than fine
I'm so Rock and Rollin'

[Chorus]
Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel It?
You know that I'm unfuckwittable
Don't you feel it?
You know that I'm unfuckwittable

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
One day I knew no one could help me in Hell
Not many people are true, fake as the lies they tell
The world is filled with good vibes, and that is what I seek
And now I'm feeling more than cool, I'm feeling more than cool
Them Jokers can't help me

[Chorus x2]</pre>
