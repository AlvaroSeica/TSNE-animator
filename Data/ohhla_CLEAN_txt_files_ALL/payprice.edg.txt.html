[Intro]
Yeah, Jaysaun, Edo

[Jaysaun]
Young youth, attitude like he's gun-proof
Got a slight taste of the game, bit it with one tooth
Thirst unquenchable for the finer things
Blitz like 49ers, chrome 9 it sings
Baritone or soprano, he stops, reload ammo
Action shifts, blow a tunnel right through your flannel
Just another urban vandal, too hot to handle
Who crack your skull like a shell, now your brain's scrambled
Nigga I'm warnin ya, family be mournin ya
You see it in my cornea, death's gon' be warmin ya over
Your ghost elevate, your soul levitate
For all the right choices, your mind better meditate
So put the gun down, or get gunned down
Frightened in the headlights, waitin to get run down
The beat's courtesy of Pete Rock
Worldwide, leavin every hood and borough in a deep shock

[Chorus: Edo.G]
If this the way you live your life
Then, who am I to give advice
In, blood money and the drugs enticing
But sometimes you gotta pay the price, man
If this the way you live your life
Then, who am I to give advice
In, blood money and the drugs enticing
But sometimes you gotta pay the price, man

[Edo.G]
Young chicken, time bomb tickin
Fruit ripe for pickin, she live her life different
Little cute-ass dime, see I saw her the last time
Doin a show, like halftime
Perform the latest, to pasttime, in these fast times
In a pitch black room, like a cast iron
To the end like my last line
She could do it cause her ass prime, but not a lifetime
It's the cash climb, life of a stripper's grind
Everybody in the world out to make the quickest dime
Her moms used to hold picket signs
She in the sickest, slime, that's why it's hard for me to kick this rhyme
She had to get it while it's hot
She wasn't that smart, they two worlds apart
Two girls that fought, her moms with her effort lays
But in the end, they both went they separate ways

[Chorus]

[Edo.G]
Young victim, media depict 'em
As a suspect, get your gut checked
Virgin in the game, never touched yet, what's next?
Get a little shot, now you into rough sex
But you can't run from living 
Said you done with prison cause the streets is unforgiving
Neighborhood full of red ribbons
Cause you came up missing, find your body with your bloody linen

[Jaysaun]
Yeah, we never did like you, the rifle'll 
stifle your life duke, and touch more kids than Michael
Everybody's a killer like Psycho
So don't get your face erased like a typo
The cycle rotates and repeats
In the streets, can't nothin stop these wolves from eatin
You in the presence of some carnivores
And ain't no use in fightin us gnarlin yours

[Chorus]

[Outro]
But sometimes you gotta pay the price, man
But sometimes you gotta pay the price, man</pre>
