TOY introducing "Sung Ballad"

The man and woman, who hotly burned  are you doing okay without me?
I thought I'd either die or pass out, I thought I'd go crazy, I thought I'd be exhausted
I miss you, I hate you
You were wonderful, I was grateful, we stayed up all night saying "baby, baby"
Now it's just an old piece by piece that turns up too much
Because it's so long ago, now I live busily
I end up saying things that weren't in my heart
I end up hiding and sighing
Ending up with the days we used to be together
Am I the only one going crazy?

My precious person, now goodbye (yes, yes, now goodbye)
The brilliantly shining eyes (Your, your eyes)
The days we used to love, now goodbye (yes, yes, now goodbye)
The red lips that burned under the moonlight
If you are leaving, I will let you go
Passionately, passionately goodbye

I throw out the remaining traces of you on the pillow we used to use together
I throw out my lingering attachment  the only things that remain are pictures? I'll erase it all
With dates and blind dates, I will reboot myself
I will delete everything of you  but it's not as easy as I think
My heart and head is playing separately  baby I am sorry
From morning to night, from one to ten, we did everything together
So it's so hard, I bite my lips
After drinking, I force myself to sleep
But alcohol and even sleeping pills can't win over you
I stay up the whole night again  why did we break up? Because of pride

My precious person, now goodbye (yes, yes, now goodbye)
The brilliantly shining eyes (Your, your eyes)
The days we used to love, now goodbye (yes, yes, now goodbye)
The red lips that burned under the moonlight (Your, your red lips)

I miss you, I'm dizzy, I'm sad, I feel like crap

ONE MORE TIME

I miss you, I'm dizzy, I'm sad, I feel like crap

Sacrificing my only life
Ending my life on the same day
But for a guy like me, this is all an extravagance
I get hurt, I shut up  adios

My precious person, now goodbye (yes, yes, now goodbye)
The brilliantly shining eyes (Your, your eyes)
The days we used to love, now goodbye (yes, yes, now goodbye)
The red lips that burned under the moonlight
If you are leaving, I will let you go
Passionately, passionately goodbye

Good night
