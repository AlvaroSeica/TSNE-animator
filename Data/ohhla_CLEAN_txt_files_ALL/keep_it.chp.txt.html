Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Me and my nigga be up in this thang
Best believe these nuts gonna hang
Take it to the left see the cold young thang
With the ass too fat and the pink to the rang
Hoping that and she'll know what to do
Just gotta chose me cause a nigga won't choose
And you see a nigga hard you know I want you
Now we up in the mall, do you like those shoes
What about that Louie, do you like that too?
Met a bunch of friends invite them too
And we'll do everything that you might wanna do
Everything that you probably wanna do
Now we up in the crib with the lean and the weed
Everybody DTF indeed
Gotta be the fliest nigga
That you ever seen
Promise I can't give you everything that you need
But I won't give you everything that you want
Wish you give me head when I blaze the blunt
Wish you let me hit it any way that you want
We up in the lex with the bang in the trunk
If a nigga run the bars and I'm blazing them up
5 to the ghetto, ladies fuck
Cause the codeine spilling all out the cup
Everybody know nigga, I don't give a fuck
Chevy in the purp with the sprite and the ice
Wassup bitch right you might see me twice
She don't love me she love my life
She don't love me she love my life
Damn she hella cold, nigga head is so tight
excuse my fresh, be polite do my best
Keep it so real don't like that shit
Keep it so real don't like that shit

God damn, god, god damn
Keep it so real don't
like that shit
Keep it so real don't
like that shit
Keep it so real don't
like that shit
God damn, god damn my fam
Keep it so real don't
like that shit
Keep it so real don't
like that shit
Keep it so real don't
like that shit
