Song:   Where's Ya Heart At
Typed by: pneumatic

[Chorus: Leathafase, (INF-Black)]
Show me where ya heart is at
You don't want no parts of that
(Drug hustle, Gun bust'n)
(Niggas stop front'n, You don't want nothing)
Show me where ya heart is at
You don't want no parts of that
(Gun bust'n, Drug hustle)
(Niggas stop front'n, You don't want nothing)

[Leathafase]
Ayo, It's 50/50 love, I had a grudge with God
Why's my life so hard, I've been mentally scarred
I done committed many sins, And I'm guilty as charged
Gun on my waist, Weed by the ankle, I'm filthy in the car
You keep grill'n me from far, Wanna spill me on the tar
Women conceal me in the bed, They wanna feel me, I'm hard
Love my heart is made of brick, Wet cement when I spit
Stand in the lane of fire and get your chest plate chipped
Stripped of your vital organs, A homicidal performance
When I'm live on stage every page read what the Bible offers
The Taurus is on, Cocked, This is never gone stop
Security got foreign Chinese machine guns with the stock
I'm the shotgun, The block, Your rocked on the spot
Chop rock, Glock bigger then Flavor Flav's clock
Your body stop, Market drop soon as the cartridge pop
Leave'n enemies dropping, A feeding frenzy for the sharks

[Chorus]

[INF-Black]
Yo, Straight out the slums, I learned new ways to get crumbs
Then they turn to cake, Rising numbers, I'm on the run
I'm outta state, Shake'n jake with two guns
Can't conversate, How the barrel scraped your son in the staircase
Stick him for his flannel, Left em pale face
I'm done, Escape with your heart's wouldn't dare chase
I'm laced, Guzzle Henny with the beer chase
Incase, I got gotta nut heavy
Good and plenty, Small waist is what I like
Give it to her real good, We could do it all night
For this paper I'm in the hood tell'n fiends they price
Shovel'n victims for they ice in this wild life of crime
Stars, Jack'n cars for a fresh pair of Nike's
And the cash in the cash drawer
Eat what you want nigga, You get what you ask for
Forty cal hollow tips'll skip through your glass jaw
Swallowing the spit, If it's war it's war

[Chorus]

[Kawz]
I bet my hammerless thirty-eight'll set em straight
Let a nigga violate, Try me I'ma catch you at a later date
Ratchet in your face, Now you hesitate
Stuttering your words, You fucking herbs
You better get it straight
Before this money leave your body in a lake
Half of yalls fake how many shells from a shotty can you take
Niggas survive, You'll probably run behind me and tell jake
Don't remind me that he tried me or I'll punch you in the face
For the cheddar leave your whole sweater lace
I'm ducking the charges, They call me heartless
But regardless put his ass in a better place
Gave his girl mouth a better taste
She a head case, All she eat is nut inside her face
Front on me I got this gun up on my waist
And my llama goes off, Turning dudes into barbeque sauce
The obvious choice, Ride with the boys, Ride with your toys
Stay with a weapon to stay on point, This is the joint
