Wale!
They ain't sayin' nothing anyway
They might as well talk about nothin

[Seinfeld Sample]
Jerry Seinfeld: This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
Cosmo Kramer: You better be careful with that thing.  You'll start a war

Ooooh

[Verse 1]
Look
I just wanna make you better, I think I can save you
But I think I'm Bi-Polar, I love you, then I hate you
Grew with disdain, though I hate whoever ain't you
Hate when I can't date you, but I also need my space too
I made room for this love, how foolish of me
And every woman lookin' at you, knew that you was lucky
So check the verse Miss, I ain't say I'm perfect
But you was low on love, what I do? Reimbursed it
And now it hurts to be around or converse witcha
And what's worse is before this I had worse witcha
Now war missles, handguns and grenades
The wars I couldn't break, Imma take 'em apart with a tank
And Momma told me, "Be careful who you love"
Gee said, "Just wrap it up, these bitches actin' up"
And as for us, we was different though, things have gotten difficult
Tried to be, Mr. Perfect, Intercontinental, hold up
You spend your time with your fiends, all the time
And all that time, with your friends, put my momentum on decline
My mind's gone evil, you changed with the season
You had a new clear heart, guess I was Hiroshima
So now I need some Xan, need some Remy and some Reefer
So when this war is over I'm not PTSDing
And I don't wanna leave her, but you know what got me wondering?
I'm scared to lose love, but even more scared to love again

Chorus (Daniel Merriweather):
But why we gotta argue, why we gotta fight
I just wanna love you, I wanna make it right
It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for
So tell me why are we at war? [Chorus repeats as a round in the background]
Why are we at war?
Why are we at war?
So baby why are we at war?

[Seinfeld Sample]
George Costanza: They get away with murder! You never see one of them lift
anything over 3 pounds.  They do whatever they want, whenever they want, and
nobody can stop them!
Jerry Seinfeld: She's like a beautiful Godzilla
George Costanza: And I'm thousands of fleeing Japanese
Cosmo Kramer: Oooh, she's a package full of energy!
Elaine Benis: She's a package full of something!
Cosmo Kramer: Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Yea, they do [whatever they want, whenever they want] and nobody else can stop it
I'm catchin' myself depositing these feelings she'd withdraw from
And I ain't got the gall to tell my Godzilla bye-bye, so I'm hurtin'
My effort is apparent, she not fertile
The anger I've adopted, the feeling's been aborted
So now I press ignore if ever Cupid tried to call up
They call me, better not, see when everything is stop
And your love's in hindsight, and you see everything it's not
Notice everything it wasn't, realizin' why it shouldn't
Ever be again, 'cause in the end, it's not 'bout what you put in
Fuck kissing and hugging, they love pushing your buttons
New love, is so beautiful, time just makes it ugly
But fuck it, I accept it, no longer will neglect it
If a period is late, then I will mark it with a question
That mean I never trust 'em, and if you  ever love 'em
Know that favorite girlfriends turn to crazy baby mothers
The war

Chorus (Daniel Merriweather) (2x):
But why we gotta argue, why we gotta fight
I just wanna love you, I wanna make it right
It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for
So tell me why are we at war? [Chorus repeats as a round in the background]
Why are we at war?
Why are we at war?
So baby why are we at war?

[Wale Outro]
Uh
Just another product of the Matrix, this maze I'm in amazes me at times
I just wanted to be at peace with you, and if I gotta settle for a piece of
you then I gotta say Peace to you
With all due respect, I do respect you enough to expect
Effort is all I ask
If we're gonna last more I gotta ask for more
And if that means I'm asking for too much, I'm sure we'll end up as our last
Or
Past
We bash
We blast
We shoot
We lose
We pass
