[Intro] {in style of "Midnight Marauders Tour Guide"}
Wel-come to.. the "Homage" for Ali Shaheed Muhammad
Remember... sound with-out Focus... is just.. noise.
Keep bouncin!

[Von Pea]
Yeah... Ay Focus... man
It's what it is man... ye-yeah!
TM... Aiyyo, listen...

I be hatin sucka emcees, and sucka producers
I never tried to make a beat until I heard The Ummah
Five mics twice and that wasn't even they best
+Midnight Marauderin+ women wear painted breast
Every rapper at the time came through for the cover
And the music was tougher, it influenced none other than
brothers that wasn't into hearin coke and Colombians
or the rage, Ali was a legend by my age
Was awoken out of my sleep the day Tribe called quits
Yeah, it was heartbreaking, but I knew it was more shit
When Phife wanted to bone Dawn from En Vouge
Sha did something iller, started a group with her
Yeah before Ms. Morgan, there was a Ms. Pearl
And then he started rappin, son is out of this world
A creator on the boards or the fader
It's him like ?Betsy Boggs?, let me tell you who's the raw, it's Shaheed

[Chorus: cuts and scratches]
"The rave of the town to your foes and your friends"
