[Kat De Luna]
Got you half flippin like fire
Come with me let me take you higher
I'm the object of all your desire
And your attention is all I require
Don't stop now
Cause you on a roll
Make me go anywhere that you go
I'm that dream in your head when you're sleepin'
I'm that secret inside that you're keepin' woah-woah

[Kat De Luna]
You want this don't front que te pasa
Speak up cual es la cosa
Ven aqui
let's get closer and closer
I say no-oh-oh
If you wanna take it slow-oh-oh
Catch up well now let's go-oh-oh
Together we run the show-oh-oh
I say no-oh-oh
If you wanna take it slow-oh-oh
Don't stop well now let's go-oh-oh
Together we run the show-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Bite your lips cause you know that you feel it
When I shake it you know you're addicted
I see you're lovin this dominicana
You like the way that I dance the bachata
Don't stop now, cause i'm on a roll
Give you that gutta you feel in your soul
My heart beats like a drum can you hear it

[Kat De Luna]
You want this don't front que te pasa
Speak up cual es la cosa
Ven aqui
let's get closer and closer
I say no-oh-oh
If you wanna take it slow-oh-oh
Catch up well now let's go-oh-oh
Together we run the show-oh-oh
I say no-oh-oh
If you wanna take it slow-oh-oh
Don't stop well now let's go-oh-oh
Together we run the show-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
