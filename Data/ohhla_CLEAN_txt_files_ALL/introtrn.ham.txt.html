Turn, this mother out

  MC Hammer, he will...
  Hammer, he is!

[Hammer]
Strong like a lion, no denyin
I'm in effect and you suckers are tryin
To get with me, you can't hang
Doin it like this I'm in with the bang
Goin boom like thunder, and you wonder
How in the world could the Hammer be under-
-neath me, he's gonna beat me
Say yes to the master and I will teach thee

[repeat 6X]
Turn, this mother out

  Hammer! Tell 'em how you came up babyyyyy...

[Hammer]
I was a student, now I'm a teacher
I was a member, now I'm a preacher
I was a worker and you was a boss
Now I'm gettin paid and you're takin a loss
Once it's up, the others just leave
Don't bold perpetrate, MC Hammer is the feature
Step off, you pump no fear
I'm MC Hammer and I'm in here to

[repeat 6X]
Turn, this mother out

  Let's get it started!</pre>
