Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Aye Hold on change that sound like a piano or something it sounds stupid I don't like that
Okay yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo you ever had a homie who was fake as fuck, (yup)
Hate your guts but the moment you came rolling through balling they wanna say what's up (what's up)
knowing that you finna be hot, (G)
But I don't owe you niggas didiley squat, (nah)
So here help me out by kicking these rocks
Before I got my deal you use to back stab me, (what?)
Laugh at me tell these women I act nasty, (ewww) so what you hooked me up with the girl that
Yes I'm datin' now, but I know if you had the chance to fuck her you would take her down, you
Slipped up like you done stepped into an oil leak, now you got me heated up and boiling, you
The definition of unloyalty, probly plotting how to go destory the scene, but you'll never destroy
The royal king, I know you always reminiscing, (uh-huh) and mad cause I'm resisting and won't
Take the time to listen making us more distant, you on that cold hearted shit
look how Hollywood Marcus is you coulda been a part of this, but shit you'll probably

[Chorus]
You'll probly fuck my girl and keep it on the down low
But yo it's all good now though
You tried to, leak my songs and give em' free downloads
But yo it's all good now though
Now if you thinking you my buddy
But always acted funny
Then you'll never be close to me, (Fuck that!)
Said if you thinking you my buddy
Tryina strip me for my money
Then you'll never be close to me, (Fuck that) nigga

[Verse 2]
I gotta about 3, 4, 5 of them left, and they like my brothers yes
they all reside on the west
their down to ride nothing less
that's what their supposed to do, no but you
walking around like you don't even know the rules
putting me in bogus moves
got me stressed out doing yoga moves, (shit)
you ain't no homie just a load of dook
you mad cause honeys never notice you, (well)
do take it personal, (why)
you'll never look half as good as I do in person nope
I'll never hold you down
I'm flossing on you now
I'm causing problems my momma like Hopsin awww you foul
I know it's you who's calling blocked i.d
but you will not find me I'm not lying so stop trying
it's just a waste of time, and you a waste of mine
say goodbye this song is for you George since you're a grateful guy

[Chorus]
You'll probly fuck my girl and keep it on the down low
But yo it's all good now though
You tried to, leak my songs and give em' free downloads
But yo it's all good now though
Now if you thinking you my buddy
But always acted funny
Then you'll never be close to me, (Fuck that!)
Said if you thinking you my buddy
Tryina strip me for my money
Then you'll never be close to me, (Fuck that) nigga

[Verse 3]
Friendship has been fucked
Quit hittin' SwizZz up
You calling him like you tryina give him a free dick suck
You ain't a part of the movement stupid you just blew it
And this shit right here proves it
And don't you email me talking about yo what's up fool
Thank you for all that you done for me but fuck you
And if you wanna act like a rowdy ape and retaliate
Meet me in the alley late I'll serve yo ass the Cali way
So don't you dare give my cd's a leak
I'll get your ass easily
Your girlfriend lives right up the street from me
I'll snatch her out from underneath the sheets
And while she screams police
I'ma just talk to her grimey like I was made to sneak
Well congratulations you've been dissed
Don't get mad at me cause who did this? you did this
So what did we learn today, never leak your friends songs
Cause if you think I'm goin' let it slide then you damn wrong

[Interlude]
I trusted yo ass man, you had my whole fucking album sitting there on your damn laptop
leaking my shit, you're a mothafuckin leaker, I'll never trust yo ass, AHHHH SHIT!!!

[Chorus]
You'll probably fuck my girl and keep it on the down low
But yo it's all good now though
You tried to, leak my songs and give em' free downloads
But yo it's all good now though
Now if you thinking you my buddy
But always acted funny
Then you'll never be close to me, (Fuck that!)
Said if you thinking you my buddy
Tryina strip me for my money
Then you'll never be close to me, (Fuck that) nigga

[Outro]
How many of have them, I don't really know anymore, friends
How many of us want them, I don't really need anymore, friends
How many of have them, I don't really know anymore, friends
How many of us want them, I don't really need anymore</pre>
