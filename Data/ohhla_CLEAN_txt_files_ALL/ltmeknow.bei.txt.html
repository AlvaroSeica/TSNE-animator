Let me know
Unh
Bei Maejor

Now this is part where we fall in love
Live without a care
We up in this club
Bottles in the air
We throw our hands up
(Baby) We throw our hands up

Tell me what you want
(Tell me what you want)
Tell me what you really want baby
And I'ma put it down for you
Baby I'ma hold it down for you
Oh woah, oh woah
Just let me know
Let me know

'Cause if ya man can't give it to you right
You should know you could get it done right, right here
(Oh woah)
And if ya plans ain't goin' how ya like
You should know you could get it how you like it right here
Oh woah, oh woah
Just let me know
Let me know

Tell what you need
(Oh baby) Tell me what you really need baby
And I would search the world for it
Take a walk around the globe for it
(Think about it)
Oh woah, oh woah
Just let me know
Let me know

'Cause if ya man can't give it to you right
You should know you could get it done right, right here
(Oh woah)
And if ya plans ain't goin' how ya like
You should know you could get it how you like it right here
Oh woah, oh woah
Just let me know
Let me know

Now this is part where we fall in love
Live without a care
We up in this club
Bottles in the air
We throw our hands up
Yeah, we throw our hands up

This is part where we fall in love
We don't even care
We up in this club
Bottles in the air
We throw our hands up
Unh, let me know baby

'Cause if ya man can't give it to you right
You should know you could get it done right, right here
(Oh woah)
And if ya plans ain't goin' how ya like
You should know you could get it how you like it right here
Oh woah, oh woah
Just let me know
Let me know

Unh, now this is part where we fall in love
Live without a care
We up in this club
Bottles in the air
We throw our hands up
Yeah, we throw our hands up

This is part where we fall in love
We don't even care
We up in this club
Bottles in the air
We throw our hands up
Unh, upside down

Just let me know</pre>
