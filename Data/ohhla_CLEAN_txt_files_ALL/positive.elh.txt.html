"99. Yeah. Positive Dream. Positive Dream. Yeah. What's up? Yeah. Positive Dream. Positive DREAM"

(Verse 1)

"A perfect picture painted, inside my mind 
see I be dreaming 'bout the things that I want
Sometimes don't make too much sense
The feeling's always intense I deal with self confidence 
Hop a fence with my father, we're in the ghettos of dreaming  
I'm dreaming up with my partners in crime: Living Legends
Giving these times an open handed account of the things 
that run through my brain when I'm asleep
A psycologyst would say they're all images I project
I say ideas I don't get yet
And still they invade my intake of sleep I peep
Repeats the places and persons dispersed in Random occurrences
Currently junior high school yards are the main points of interest
In one instant I had a childhood crush, 
Hold my hand then explain that she had cancer of full bearing improperties
And I, felt the pain never thought about Elaine in the same content
Here and there I take a nap and feel the lain contents of eyelids describing
My likeness as an alien abductee wandering a parking lot with people I never met
Everyone's running and screaming but I'm stuck in cement
Feel like a bed of the light, as I'm pulled like  Dr. Spock
Take a walk on the ship
No I'm in bed sweating and shit 
I wanna bet on nonbelievers that I've been to the outer limits
But to them it's a gimmick 
except for homies like Aesop
who dream heavy like Napalm bein dropped,
With no warning 
Fuckin exhausted in the morning 
I'm in mounring"

(chorus)

"(These) persons and places and things, Sometimes don't make sense to sing
out loud to be proud of the way that I work hard to bring, 
New rhymes and substance through processing dreams" (2x)

(verse 2)

"Using my ways of the world that I've learned 
to ensure my endurance through hardest of times
Using logic incorporating projects with folks provoking 
(nonsense/conscience [same time]) elevation through rhyme
We are soldiers of a century determined by dreams with no dreams
We don't see why we're here
For this planet where we dropped off for seconds
Haven't learned all the lessons yet we all count all our blessings
Mounting to nothing is far from the truth see these boots are for prompting
Climbing and stomping
Naming off a certain something you've achieved might help a struggling parent
Raise their seed, until all these minds that are rusting completely
Are trusted with openness we could never hope to get anywhere
My rhymes stay repetitious with positive dreams... positive dreams"

"Positive dreams, staying alive, positive dreams"

(chorus)

(verse 3)

"Nothing is accomplished by dwelling on nonsense
Nothing is achieved through stagnant lead
Something is approached by a forward step
The early birds get the worm it's your turn to learn
Open up that book called your dreams take a look
Read about your life don't be threatened by the knife
Cutting through your (life/strife) is always running through your life
I tell my self just not to stress take up new light
Nothing is hated that can't be loved
Something is created through the ultimate love
If your hating on hatred, love's got the golden glove
Sock that bitch in the face and raise your soul above"

"Time to make a change, man and stop looking 
so negative on everything. Fuck that shit dude. Fuck that shit."

(chorus)

(verse 3 #2)

"Nothing is accomplished by dwelling on nonsense
Nothing is achieved through stagnant lead
Something is approached by a forward step
The early birds get the worm it's your turn to learn
Open up that book called your dreams and take a look
Read about your life don't be threatened by the knife
Cutting through strife that's always running through your life
I tell my self just not to stress take off the shelf a new light
Nothing is hated that can't be loved
Something is created through the ultimate love
If your hating on hatred, love's got the golden glove
Sock that bitch in the face and raise your soul above"

"Positive dreams. Call them shits like positive dreams
positive dreams. yeah. Positive dreams"

(chorus)

"Positive dreams. Living legends. Melancholy Gypsys. 
1999. Enjoy the beat. Let it rise. Positive dreams"</pre>
