[Intro: Li-Mouse (Cno Evil)]
Cno Evil, muthafucka, yeah
(Put the beat up a little bit, I can't hear)
Yeah, go get 'em, kid, go get 'em
We ain't fucking around no more, this is The Rodentz right here, muthafucka
(Turn it up) yeah, go get 'em kid, kid

[Cno Evil]
Aiyo, hold down the fort, I'll be gone for a short while
I'm in denial about this sport called rap
Had a doubt, took a scouting report
Now I'm shouting, we have no hope, there's no support
Face it, man, we must go back to the basics
If we make mistakes, we have to erase them
Back to the drawing board, I'm not withdrawing my sword
I will keep fighting, and stabbing these chords
Let's restore it back, man, but why should I bother?
Sonning these wanna be MC's like I'm their father
Applehead rappers spilling out just like cider
Getting trapped up, all up in the net like spiders
Make a bet, man, what's your wager?
That I will become your hip hop savior
What, I didn't think that you would believe me
Other pitchers in the bullpen wanna be relieving me

[Interlude: Li-Mouse]
Aiyo, I told you muthafuckas, this ain't no game, kid
Get the fuck off of us, The Rodentz is here, muthafucka
Get the fuck off my man Cno, his beats are fire
I'm fire, what, niggas, what? Fuck you, kid
Get 'em kid, get 'em!

[Cno Evil]
I'm the rain giver, I entertain sinners
Destruct your body, like you got a slayed liver
Now the pain giver, like the Punisher
With the skull t-shirt, with the silencer
Thunderous bolts, clearing out from the scene
Fast on the wheels like Lightning McQueen
Real grammar, dot the I's and cross the T's
You cross-eyed and polka dotted tees
You should of seen, the J Green Eyes, realize
The lies, got you mesmerized like a dream
Enter the team, comprised
Of Mickey and Johnny, yes, those two guys
I'll just, interrupt your session, yessir
Something being brought up and mentioned
Missed seen, cuz it's me and my training montage
Working hard like Mouse up in the garage

[Interlude: Li-Mouse]
Yo, you got more in you, kid, yo, fuck that
Hit 'em with another one, I don't give a fuck
Show these kids where the fuck we come from
White Plains, New York, niggas, I don't give a fuck if ya'll think we're soft
If we ain't ghetto, muthafucka
This is Cno Evil, this is Li-Mouse, muthafuckas, get 'em!

[Cno Evil
I had a great start, and I'm going through the whole game
On the score board, you won't be seeing no others name
Cuz I'm fighting hard now, but it's so hard now
Wondering how I guard the light and charge the mic, wow
I'm getting fly, fucking getting high, got a clear brain
No drink, just adrenaline going through my veins
My soul is drenched clean, no sins inside of me
No dope, just hope, no drugs, no slugs, just love
No friends to tap me, got me down and out
I just need a pen and a paper to show you what I'm about
We like cataracts the way our lyrics run through like water
And put you in the cobra clutch like Sgt. Slaughter
It's tragic, get stomped out like a bunch of maggots
Our rhymes is gemstones like a quarts of agates
Fantasia, but we make music like it's magic
And flow in the open ocean like it's pelagic
Passion of the mic, man, I'm bashing the mic
Crack the neck back then whiplash the mic
Crash the mic, man, I love smashing the mic
Direct deposit to the bank for making cash on the mic
I get hype, snipe with the infered rifle
Paper full of knowledge like the holy bible
You getting stripped from your titles, boy, run like fools
We in the bar taking shots of liquor test tubes
I bring death to the mic and I come here to collect
And ain't a damn thing change, boy, I cash those checks
Ruler Cno, Evil, jam is deadly
Quick to stick my Rodent mic right through your belly
Realize our rhymes, is like choreography
Unbreakable, you can't insert that poison inside of me
I got powerful blood cells that block it back
My mind going wacko like an Animaniac
Abstract on the track, a designed creation
It's not a cartoon but my darts is animation
Shape shifting changing, abstract rearranging
Willy Wonka, chocolate ganja, pure imagination
Strictly 5.1 just like Dolby
I chill with the Bryant kid, and I ain't talking about Kobe
Still bring it to the hole, like a halo, holy
Slowly, earning that green like guacamole

[Outro: Li-Mouse]
Told ya muthafuckas, ya'll can't fuck with us, ya'll can't fuck with Li-Mouse
This is a fucking wrap, fire, muthafucka
Haha, I don't even need to say nothing no more
Cuz this cat just RIPPED this track like it was nothing
He ripped it like my bank statement
Haha, word, get the fuck out of here
That's word... The Rodentz, Li-Mouse, Cno Evil, no one other
Whoever claims to be The Rodentz, yo, fuck you, ha
I'm out... hold up, hold up, I gotta come back
Fuck you muthafucka, ya'll ain't got shit on us
That's my word, White Plains, New York, White Plains, New York
Not Yonkers, not Staten Island, not Brooklyn
Nigga, this is White Plains!
I don't give a fuck, uptown, yeah, we rich
We got money, fuck you... bitches...
It's a wrap</pre>
