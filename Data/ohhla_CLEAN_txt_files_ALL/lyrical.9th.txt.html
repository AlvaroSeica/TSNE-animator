['V for Vendetta' sample]
Whatcha gonna do? We've swept this place
You've got nothing, nothing but your bloody knives
And your fancy karate gimmicks, we have guns
	No, what you have are bullets
	And the hope that when your guns are empty, I'm no longer standing
	Because if I am, you'll all be dead before you've reloaded
That's impossible! Kill him

[Intro: 9th Prince]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know what it is, yo

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, staring at the blank piece of paper
Thinking how can I express my anger
First of all, any jail time, is hard labor
If I blow, my baby moms probably catch the vapors
I stand tall as a skyscraper
Head in the cloud like Air Force lasers, on Riker's Island
Niggas playing tag with razors, police gunning
I run it like the Portland Trail Blazers, but this ain't full court
It's more like verbal bloodsport, dope fiends coming up short
A few lines in my notebook, I write like I snort
But I don't get high, on my own supply
Transport us when they transport, Killarm' gun report
Vocabulary falling out my mouth piece, my wisdom is deep
Like Malcolm X when he speakers, four door bulletproof jeep
So when I creep through these dark streets
I leave niggas flat like slow leaks

[Chorus: Islord]
Check that lyrical disaster, 9th Prince will mash ya
With that four-four automatic, niggas don't want static, yeah, yeah
Yeah, what what what, yeah you don't want no static, nigga
Check that lyrical disaster, 9th Prince will blast ya
With that four-four automatic, niggas don't want static, yeah, yeah
Yeah, what what what, yeah you don't want no static, nigga

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, I speak from old school days of gangstas with gold teeth
Jewel thieves, corporate thugs
Killas who put hands on former colleagues
Run up in your crib, put these hollow heads in your seeds
Iced out stop watch, I'm bringing 'em back
Time is moving fast, It's eleventh song, waving a mack
I sleep hazardous, with the AK-47 underneath my mattress
Me and my Killarm', we gang bang models and actresses
The black James Bond living lavish
My vision is clear, like daytime skylines
Cock it back, I watch the rhyme blast like a nine
My bars is bullets, pulvarize your spine
Caught up in the midst of crime, I had to do time
Back to the situation, with the God U Nation
Bust my gun on the devil's plantation
I'm a one time felon, put four in your melon
Leave your head swelling, now the hood call you Big Head Melvin
Criticize my life, I have niggas kidnap your babies, while I'm raping
your wife, aight?

[Chorus]

[9th Prince]
This is a global warming, my rhyme rain acid rain whenever I'm brainstorming
Niggas be calling me the Transformer, because I be transforming
To the planet of stars, pretty bitches and fly cars
Freeing people from behind bars
I was sent by Allah, don't get it twisted, your face will get scarred
You will remember me, the rest of your life
I dig deep into your soul, like being cut by a sharp knife
All I do is meditate, all my life I had to set a nigga straight, no debate
Feel the hate, 9th Prince the God, so keep your faith
Shopping rocks on plates, supply the tri-state
New York demonstrate on how I illustrate
Stacking up G's the size of wedding cakes

[Chorus]</pre>
