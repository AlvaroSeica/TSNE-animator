We all make moves that don't turn out right
Maria was the biggest mistake of my life
A beautiful face, great fashion taste
A tiny little waist, and a clean slate?
Threw her in a video, I didn't think I had a chance
Plus she had just dated one of my friends
There's rules and shit, but he called it quits
Gave me his blessing and I ran with it
But that didn't mean she would want me too
I knew she liked my songs or at least a few
Took a bottle of champagne, three rum and Coke
to grow the balls to kiss her, because sober I choke
She just seems so damn out of my league
So when she kiss back, I could not believe
What I can't believe now, sittin here like how
did I fuck this up? I'm runnin solo now
(Runnin solo now.)

[Chorus]
I fucked up, Maria, so come back please!
It can be like it was in those couple of weeks
that we chilled, it was ill, how we played everyday
So let's make pretend it didn't happen, okay?
I fucked up, Maria, shit was in my head!
YOU were the one, I didn't know it yet!
Whatcha say? Call the day we can think over drinks
I'm just too sure to let this ship sink

[Effect]
Backtrackin a bit, I had recently split
with a chick that had me hung up for a bit
But this was hit shit, I was fully equipped
Ready to move on, wanted nothing but this
Chick with the red whip, we had the same friends
Look great together at the shows and then
I slipped, and called out my ex's name
Justified it like, "The first two letters are the same!"
She let that go, so the fact she blow
shit off like that, even impressed me so
much to the point I could act like, yo
The fact my ex wants me back got me here like, "So?"
Yeah right, took the bait, then I got hooked
Reeled in, thrown back, hit the water and look
for Maria everywhere, she's gone, lesson learned
Swam off in the bottle, never swallowed the worm
(I never swallow that shit..)

[Chorus]

[Effect]
Back on my feet, moved on for real
My ex is gone, sealed the deal
Finally ready, had finally scrapped
all the bullshit that was holdin me back
It was at that exact moment found out that
She had a new boyfriend and serious, in fact
He's a great guy and I hope he is
Cause honestly, she's probably the smartest chick
I've ever have in my bed, and we never had sex
She wanted to wait, what could I expect?
I'd rather wait forever than to live in regret
Plus I knew when it happened, it would be the best
I know I can't be mad, know I was dense
I fucked it all up, it's been downhill since
But what I wanna tell her by the end of the night
Fuckin that up was the biggest mistake of my life!
(Fuck my life...)
