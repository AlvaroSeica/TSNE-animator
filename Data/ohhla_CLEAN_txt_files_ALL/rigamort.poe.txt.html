[Poetic Death]
Yo, aiyyo nightmare in the physical
Dash through the holy gates and search for the spiritual
Paparazzi, Medusa's body still haunts me
And tombstone memories embedded in my dialogue
Too many revolutionaries speak on revolution
Too many revolutionaries imitate the movement
You see us spent your timeline, searchin for the night owls
While night owls through textiles can metamorph perception
Here's what I'm guessin - tough talk procrastination
while the crooks with deaf and dumb ears are slaves to masturbation
Reflection in the mirror but he too afraid to seek it
There's knowledge in my words but you ask me not to speak
We see the movement, Nosferatu in a trenchcoat
He walks across Persephone the existance is neglected
My third eye perception, will resurrect the ancients
The manifest destiny, songs of the slave trade
Lessons, a negative thought prevent progression
Your lack of understanding only leads to underhandings
The middle man lifestyle is waiting for the death of me
In peace for my brothers out my life is many blessings
Puppets in the Matrix don't deserve a happy ending
So if I die tomorrow I'll be happy where they send me {*2X*}

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Hangin off a tree branch, reflected off the memory
Dying in my deathbed and now I can't remember me
Love is what you make it, and life is what you take from it
Sleepy Hollow, a phantom dyin in a hospital

[Poetic Death]
Yo, yo the marksman, fell and he shot the baby coffins
And daytime funerals for those who fear the darkness
I converse with Mary Magadeline the Sabbath
And walked next to Jesus in the days before the Nazareth
Judas of Iscariot his testimony's in me
A raven in the distance who's a witness to the mystery
Poet's in the afterlife, a witness to the sorrow
A peasant to the theme but will she live to see tomorrow?
The sky darkens, and raindrops invade your temple
In the midst of it all, your eyes crack the inner vision
7th crown chakra, 6th degree magnitude
I blast on many crews, enlight 'em with intelligence
A fifth of my existence, a void with the Demigod
3rd degree science in the presence of the fallen
My second nature, I'm #1 on this microphone
I manifest the heat before I erase 'em with a battle tone
Morse code never meant to see the thing clearly
And telepathic energy, I speak without words
You see Egyptian pharaohs used to get good rays from the altar
Until the death of me the holy rise over water
So what is Death?</pre>
