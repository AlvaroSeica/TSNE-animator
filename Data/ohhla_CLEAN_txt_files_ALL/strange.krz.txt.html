Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Breathe deeply my friend
You're normal take it easy
You're only strange you know

[Chorus]
It ain't the same
When no one remembers your name
And nobody knows where you came from
And they don't applaude you
They only know you
They only know your strange
And nobody knows who to blame and
Everyone knows it's the same so
They don't applaude you
They only know you
They only know your strange
You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
Everybody
I see you lookin with ya lookin ass

[Verse 1]
Gotta get em off for the reggie
Cause I'm a little heavy-er
And I never thought the industry would let me in er
And they know I am no beginner
So I eat a rabbit like it's my dinner (Kali)
And I used to get stares from the pair of eyes
Man I'm not gonna get them paralized
We sing clinge the thing is I am sterilized
He sing sing and scare and they terrified
So whitch way is he goin
Ball to the fall every fall in a hole and
I won't stop even at all till I'm am known
The world so cold I make them fall with a quote (ok)
Spider caves are rhymes vet I'm next (ok)
But only pretty boys would get laid but I'm sex (ok)
It's almost over for this industry
The blueprint is strange music and you know they mention me
We in your pocket like were loose change the new thang
Is you could make em love it wen your strange

[Chorus]
It ain't the same
When no one remembers your name
And nobody knows where you came from
And they don't applaude you
They only know you
They only know your strange
And nobody knows who to blame and
Everyone knows it's the same so
They don't applaude you
They only know you
They only know your strange
You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
Everybody
I see you lookin what you lookin at

[Verse 2]
Fat guys are in now
Everybody love the guy the thing can't bend down
So if you got your chin down and
If anybody can come in and kill and gut the haters so now
Kod and seepage make them so their cleavage freakish
Maybe they bust spin out the bus
So we cause the leakage
Cause it's unfair to be this rarity
Thought I would be some charity case
The industry would be scared of my face
Cause I don't fit in any of their categories
This fat boy will show you how these independent adults make them noises
I was hard now I am easy to look at
Breezys don't think I look real fat
My cd ain't easy to put back
See we got's to you lanes
Roll odd so we strange
Were not gonna change our shit bangs nigga

[Chorus]
It ain't the same
When no one remembers your name
And nobody knows where you came from
And they don't applaude you
They only know you
They only know your strange
And nobody knows who to blame and
Everyone knows it's the same so
They don't applaude you
They only know you
They only know your strange
You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
You don't look like everybody else
Everybody
I see you lookin witcha lookin ass

[Tech N9ne]
I be the one that not normal baking a bitch
in my hot caramel shaking the chick
And I got carnal taking a flick and I shot porno naked
and wicked is not formal waking the sick when I got born
On the funny farm warned id be on you like on ya

Look at the six and the seven on my arm though nigga I'm totally torn yo
Obli get then I'm bossin this shit put you quick in coffin

Wen I get this pop and take a pic and never know when I'm odd

So I went to get the doe an in no time-in

So u punk mutha fuckas gonna be stuck when I rage!

[Chorus]

And nobody knows who to blame and
Everyone knows it's the same so
