[Boots Riley]
What the fuck?!? (*Echoes*)

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
This is that shit that the po-po's hate
When we talkin' to our folks and they love and relate
Shakin' in their boots when we start the funk
They ain't scared of rap music
They scared of us
This is that shit that the po-po's hate
When we talkin' to our folks and they love and relate
Shakin' in their boots when we start the funk
They ain't scared of rap music
They scared of us

[Boots Riley]
I write my lyrics on parking tickets and summons to the court
I scribbled his on an application for county support
I practice this like a sport
Met Donald Trump and he froze up
standin' on his Bentley yellin', "Pimps down, hoes up!"
Stop trying to front off
Break our ass a clump off
We goin' stop the world and make you motherfuckers jump off
Watch me junk off, molotovs and bricks
Mr. Bailiff, you can put that in the transcripts
Is you a have or have not? Huh..
When you run out of bullets, grab rocks
or throw ham-hocks
Cause the door to the pen slam locks
It don't open when your fam knocks
'less you rich and have stocks
I eat my dinner outta Spam box
They carry cash off in Gladlocks
This is for them babies with they empty plates
This is that shit that the po-po's hate

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
This is that shit that the po-po's hate
When we talkin' to our folks and they love and relate
Shakin' in their boots when we start the funk
They ain't scared of rap music
They scared of us
This is that shit that the po-po's hate
When we talkin' to our folks and they love and relate
Shakin' in their boots when we start the funk
They ain't scared of rap music
They scared of us

Life in the game showin' no remorse and no shame
Rocks share up on thangs
Due to the imminent cocaine
In my brain, I know it's wrong
but a job'd take too long
I'm robbin' niggas at gunpoint, just to keep my PG&amp;E on
and we own
Kodiakin' narcotics, just to keep it going neurotic
Pushin' the product
? got shot in my partna, dropped a chopper in his lap
This shit is a distract from the black on black
A systematic attack on me and my race
Face it, found a way out this cycle before I'm six feet deep in the dirt
A consequence of puttin' it worth
This money and ho's and clothes ain't worth it
even though my pockets is hurtin'
For certain, it's goin' to be curtains if I keep on for certain (What's the word?)
As you get older you just realize, man
It's human nature to have thangs
but I got to get out the game
Don't be shoutin' my name
Temptation callin', will I sacrifice my life 
in order to be ballin' this all in time?

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
This is that shit that the po-po's hate
When we talkin' to our folks and they love and relate
Shakin' in their boots when we start the funk
They ain't scared of rap music
They scared of us
This is that shit that the po-po's hate
When we talkin' to our folks and they love and relate
Shakin' in their boots when we start the funk
They ain't scared of rap music
They scared of us

But the people love it, the people love it, the people love it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

But the people love it, the people love it, the people love it

Yeah, yeah, yeah</pre>
