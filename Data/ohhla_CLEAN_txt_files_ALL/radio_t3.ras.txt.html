Yeah. Royal Green boy ay
Rasaq boy, know I'm saying yeah

[Rasaq]
Royal Green what you hear in your speakers, now that the dude'll ride
Your best bet to step out the booth, and commit a suicide
Partna it's do or die, ever since my crew and I
Made plans to pile money, make it go up to the sky
You ain't no gutter guy, so why you trying to front and lie
You softer than a chunk of pie, talking till your tongue is dry
I was up at Candlelight, thinking bout a high rise
I'm so damn high, if I fell it be a sky dive
Ride at your risk, cause them boys be doing driveby's
Jumping over high gates, I swear they only 5'5"
And I'm the wise guy, riding on the driver side
Making scrilla multiply, run up and you dramatized
Look in my mama's eyes, six figgas gon get me there
Hopefully before a rocket chair, and all the silver hair
Boys mugging at me, I don't even see your stares
Cause a lil nigga's cool, and it's real niggaz rare
Tote the tupperware, rubber handles go everywhere
I ain't never scared, limped around like I ain't never cared
If my life is spared, then I'ma stay humble
But it's hard to be a lion, when you living in the jungle mayn</pre>
