At this time I'd like to welcome back my congregation
that's been waitin patient for me to distribute this information
About this rap game and it's quality disintegration
And stop blamin Waka Flocka, he ain't why yo' shit ain't blazin
Maybe somethin 'bout your lack of originality
And your content is a constant braggin right about your salary
Then you're mad at me when I burn a verse like a fat calorie
And I hurt you even worse, your woman is feelin me fanatically
Dramatically I push myself to the brink of this art form
Of course you ain't chargin me, you're a rhinoceros with no horn
I'm monsterous at home in a conflict zone
My natural tone is hazardous than slashes gashes through your blood and bone
So I answer the phone, "Hello? Can you call me back?
I'm blowed and scribe scrolls until there's bruises in my finger folds"
I'm mad at Rubin, spit it crude enough to start a riot
My mind's fried like everything in Black and Latin people's diets
Psychotic, iconic, ironic mamis find erotic
I'm provided with a lot of excited exotic vagina
Behind the stained glass windows with pictures of angels
where the holy water's been replaced with Judas blood to pray to
Kneelin in the pews followin the father's maze
More crowded than Tijuana whore houses on dollar days
I am past the, point of bein a pastor
Inside of this wicked church I prove master

[Chorus: Chino XL] + (Ms. Germ Free)
Cursed me since the first day of my birth
They thirst for what my words are worth
Once they're heard they'll scorch the Earth
They tried to burn me in this church
(Fire, brimstone)
(Liars, by my throne) Inside this wicked church
(God bless, my soul)
{*both*} It hurts inside this wicked church

[Chino XL]
Yeah, I've been through a lot of things that would've made you quit
"Too many punchlines, Chino rhymes too quick"
But if your favorite garbage artist did it he's a genius
Monkeys dancin around, don't even speak English
Wonder if they'd feel me even if they can, I'm Rembrandt
I'll spit in your corny camp until my lips cramp
Fiscally I punish 'em
Make ASCAP stand for Always See Chino XL Accumulatin Publishing
Displayin mayhem mannerism that'll shatter your catechism
More written compositions than there's crucifixes in the Vatican
Discouragin anyone's adamant arrogance
Shootin, stranglin cherubims ridin through Heaven on chariots
I'm no idiot, library books try to rent me
I'm very literate, never dressin like Fonzworth Bentley
I've had it up to here and there's nothin to fear except fear itself
And even fear fears Chino XL

[Chorus]

[Chino XL]
Medically it's sickness in my mental tissue
Psychiatrist couldn't rescue, even my issues have got issues
Giving every dollar I make to a major
I'd rather have a blind bitch shave my balls with a razor
My hatred's creative berated gospel singers
Spit enough acid anger to give euthanasia to every youth in Asia
Savior with most wicked behavior on the Earth's soil
Minister tried to baptize me the water just started to boil
They worship Steve Jobs for creating the Apple invention
Ignoring the god that created the actual apple for our nutrition
Rappin about what you paid for your garments
'til your fragile life is ripped apart by extreme violence
Shooting you through your temple 
right through the screen window of your E-book Kindle
while you're reading shamefully false Ann Coulter info
Skitzo, morbid novel that's ominous poison poems
Call your real estate agent, I'm about to hit you close to home
I can't lie, you wearin them tight pants confuses me
Why would a nigga wanna give his sperm count a eulogy?
The Lyric Jesus spittin scriptures unmercifully
But born to parents that would've lost custody to Charlie Sheen
This industry is all wrong
Rap skills invisible like albino niggaz hitchhiking in a snowstorm
The wicked church is hopin hip-hop will deteriorate
So I'm spazzin out like Michael J. Fox with a Shake Weight~!

[Chorus]

[Ms. Germ Free]
It hurts...
