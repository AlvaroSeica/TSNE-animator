Watch as we change &amp; mutate into a freak show
Twiztid, serial killin' juggalos
Watch as we change &amp; mutate into a freak show
Twiztid, serial killin' juggalos

[Monoxide Child]
I was born an accident, off the ripper
Free spirit but a mind drifter
Vampire labeled me the blood sipper
Wit' an X in the middle of my head, the fallen son
Gravewalker, leader of a legion of killas and soul stalkers
Midnight Marauders
We put the world in a submission
We told all of y'all to listen
Twiztid monistic superstition
Transforming, like a shadow in the dark, I float by
Looking at you dead in the eye
Time to wake the dead on up and ring the alarm
I got you bitches shaking and nervous with sweaty palms
From the beyond
Lands where mortals will never roam
Homeless in a pitchblack room all alone
Seperated, until death, do it's own
So I create and populate the dead zone

[Monoxide Child]
Watch as we change &amp; mutate into a freak show
Twiztid, serial killin' juggalos
Watch as we change &amp; mutate into a freak show
Twiztid, serial killin' juggalos
Watch as we change &amp; mutate into a freak show
Twiztid, serial killin' juggalos
Watch as we change &amp; mutate into a freak show
Twiztid, serial killin' juggalos

[Jamie Madrox]
Brand new, brand motherfucking new
Every MC in the vicinity bumped to number 2
Coming out like freak shows
And all y'all hoes that don't know
Y'all catch elbows in dickholes
Bitch, you don't understand the Dark Carnival
The misunderstood realm of all juggalos
Called freak shows, you make fun of 'em every day
But when we return wit' axes, y'all bitches run away
I'm a warlock, walk on water wit' wicked spells
Banished to purgatory, but a life of heaven and hell
See me for all that I am, and all that I do
The multiple man, appear in multiples of two
Evolution of the soul took place in a cacoon
And we appear from the shadows by the light of the moon
We the night breed, walking amongst the dead
Nobody can figure out what's going on inside of our head

Watch as we change &amp; mutate into a freak show
Twiztid, serial killin' juggalos
Watch as we change &amp; mutate into a freak show
