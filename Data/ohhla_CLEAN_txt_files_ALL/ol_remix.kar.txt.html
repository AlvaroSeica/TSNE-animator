Bomb.

Ya'know why I listen to bomb the way I drop up in a blood clot

Dem man nah realize the way I do the technology way don't I identify

They're a big mon ting a gwaan pon dem streets
ya ya way a controlla dey  fada (Eh eh)
Me go tek where I bwaught tings
Who tellin' where dem idiot sound bwoy
Let dem fools move a gwaan way

[Kardinal Offishall]
Ol' Time Killin' I'm feelin', I'm spillin'
I'm pulling out heat on industry niggas earning a million
With bullshit like Gilligan's
Somebody go check Will and them
and ask Uncle Phil to rep me while my shots get rid of dem
Dis X y'all I'm feel it all up in yo mega-lens
Somebody go tell Missy I'm a hundred minute mission (Listen!)
Hunched over the side I'm a lyrical homicide
Ride di gyal feel a bone if I a pon tity pride (HEY!)
Slew dem, Boo dem al dem fassy nah crew dem
Yo Kardinal and Busta come to crush the liccle fool dem (Who Dem?!)
The Circle Click and The Flipmode Squad reppin' da' T-Dot and B.K. back to 
y'all (HEY!)

[Busta Rhymes]
On a for nor say all ah fi stop the mumbo jumbo
Fore' mi run ah go call Carl Columbo
For Lith' causin' a bumble hole
No stop the fire see how she da' very symbol
To leave you with holes and dimples
Inside of your shittin' cripple a nigga (DAMN SON!)
Gimme da roll out
I'll dismantle ya whole mouth
For talking what you nah know now
Hacksaw Jim Duggan some of these niggas is frontin'
Nuff' of these niggas is nothin'
Always huffin' and puffin'
I'll sue come and give you a cuffin' (AH-OOH!)
Frontin' like you tough and soft as a blueberry muffin
(EASY RUDE BWOY!)(FOOAH!)
Because of circumstance I might have to go hurt ya' man
It's such a shame the way we fuck up the party and done the dance

Chorus: [Jully Black &amp; BlackKat]
It's a Ol' Time, Ol' Time Killin'
We a deal with, run and get your money clip (BLOOK!)
For another day (BLOOK!)
In another way (WHAT!)
De man dem, nah take nah ray ray
We are murderer
"The..The MC..." -KRS-One
Killa...
"Murder She Wrote" -Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers
"Murderer" -Barrington Levy
"When time it come to my sound which is de champion sound" -Major Mackerel

[Kardinal Offishall]
Bun ya calm give tanks and praise
Put on ya' vest, protect ya' chest
From dem hollow points stray
We runnin' in da' streets
And we wildin' on the mics (SAY WHAT!)
The dress code is beats and white Nike's
Nuff niggas shinin' but I'm beggin' you to look again
The teams are so sold like Jordan playing for Washington
Style is like Allen I. on the all-star team (it's yoo much for you!)
Make you wanna wake out ya' dream and wipe the dribble off your sweatshirt
Corny niggas get hurt flirtin' with death
Every time the mic sees my breath
This ain't a killin', it's a favor that we doin'
I'm taking em' out of misery fore' da' crowd start booing em'

[Busta Rhymes]
Screwing and pursuin'
Splitting em' in 2 and em'
Niggas I have to remember fore' I have to get all of my crew and em'
Wild street niggas from way back ah while I keep it hot
Flexing with Bill Golayoot from B.K. to da' T-Dot

Chorus: [Jully Black &amp; BlackKat]
It's a Ol' Time, Ol' Time Killin'
We a deal with, run and get your money clip (BLOOK!)
For another day (BLOOK!)
In another way (WHAT!)
De man dem, nah take nah ray ray
We are murderer

[Kardinal Offishall]
Ah ha!
Crown the king him Kardinal start to sing
And make these weak cats pop the diamonds out they pinky ring
And sell it off when I go off
When the drummer start drummin' smokin' rocks up in the corner talkin' bout'
(Yo Bust Coming!)

[Busta Rhymes]
It'll be last one of you amateurs that will mash up any challengers
Fuck you both stop coming out pick up any passengers
Yo pere dutty make a tink a gwaan
Bus-A-Bus and Kardinal yeah will fill up a arsenal, like carnival yo
While we chillin' and fulfillin' niggas with listenin' pleasure
Where's my drink yo let's salute the Ol' Time Killin'
You actin bitchy man, my trigga finger itchy man
We dont engage in any social activity wit' Chin-Chi man
2 body bag and a cute casket
Could put you and a whole a ya' fruit friend in 1 fruit basket (Chyo!)
And when the dance done you know we complete
You better bounce before we cock and put a shot in a ya blood cleat

Chorus: [Jully Black &amp; BlackKat]
It's a Ol' Time, Ol' Time Killin'
