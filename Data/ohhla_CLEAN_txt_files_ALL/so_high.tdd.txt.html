Eightball, Trey Songz
We high

(Trick Daddy, Intro continued)
Good evening ladies and gentleman
This is you're captain speakin' to ya
I'd like to welcome all of you aboard my flight
A flight that's promised to take you high
Way high up in the sky
So get out'cha blunts
Ya Dutchmasters and ya Backwoods
And I'll turn ya seatbelt signs off

(Verse 1, Trick Daddy)
I only smoke the best bud
Jamaica and Bahamas got the best herb, yes sir
I could smoke, toke after toke
Won't give a triple choke
And it won't hurt my throat, nope!
Chinky eyed, just ridin' n vibin'
On that real fire
Be high for two-three hours
And I'm cool wit' A-I, but hey
I ain't too much into Phillie's
But split a Dutch and I'll re-fill it
And I ain't friendly, so nope, ya can't hit it
I smoke good trees
Yo collard-greens full of reefer seeds
You use too many chemicals
Too much added stuff, fool, it ain't real kush!
One joint of that G-14
Will have you higher than your highest dreams, just floa-ting
Not knowin' if you're comin' or goin'
But when it's partly-cloudy, be prepared for the storm
And get high

(Hook, Trey Songz)
Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high
Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high (High)

(Trick Daddy, talking through-out hook)
Love your stewardist coming through
With snacks and drinks
Everybody got cotton-mouth, or the munchies
So y'all keep smokin' that good-good
Help ya fly along, high
High in the sky

(Verse 2, Eightball)
Roll a Cigarillo, fire it up n' hit it
Feels so good man, it's hard for me to quit it
M-I-A, land of the palm trees
T double D came through with the bomb trees
And when a nigga inhale this
I had to put my shades on, get behind tint
In the clouds, lookin' down on the ground
Eightball, big black playa from the mound
Remember when, I used to have them dime-sacks
Lil ma circle by my house wit' the weed trap
Now my Zip-Lock's be full of bubble-kush
Spark it like a broads bush when she's on douche
Fruit cocktail, you could tell, by the smell
Burn one, let the whole club know I'm here (Heeey!)
Let's fly tonight
Come ride wit'cha boy and get high tonight

(Intermission, [Trey Songz] &amp; Trick Daddy)
[Feel the vibe]
Ain't nothin' like bein' able to smoke-smoke good-good
[Enjoy the ride]
[Deep insiiide]
And be waaay up here in the air
[We so high]
Away from all the troubles
[Feel the vibe]
And problems that's goin on down there in the real world
[Enjoy the ride]
Ohh, it feel good, don't it?
[Deep inside]
[We so high]

(Hook, Trey Songz)
Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high (Up in the Himalayas)
Roll up and feel the vibe (Gettin' money, we out)
Lay back, enjoy the ride (Smoke on, smoke on)

(Verse 3, Trick Daddy)
The only people I know, who don't smoke
Is Jesus, C-O, and my last P-O
Yo, but I ain't on papers no mo'
Ain't gotta creep and sneak
At least not to blow (Not to blow)
I spent my first two years gettin' high
By smokin' dollar joints rolled outta 1.5's
That was 'round '84, '85
Smoke all week for the dimes
Now nigga that's live (Nigga that's live)
Visine to help clear my eyes (My eyes)
Sprayed cologne on, when it was time for me to go home
I been doin' this for twenty years (Twenty years)
Ain't never seen or heard of one man that weed done killed
So just chill (Just chill, take puff here, puff there)
Take a puff here, there
To bring ya down a lil' off ya pills
After that, go and eat'cha a meal
But'chu gon' have to bathe ya ass to get the smell out'cha hair, yeah

(Hook, Trey Songz)
Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside (Inside)
Exhale, we so high (We so high)
Roll up and feel the vibe (Feel the vibe)
Lay back, enjoy the ride (Enjoy the ride)
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high

(Trick Daddy, talking)
Sad enough, yours truly
The booger-man himself
Bout to take you all across the world
Take ya everywhere wit' the electric chair
Gon' let'cha see anything wit' the wind
But then again...
You'll never get high like this again
Come again my friends!
Ha-haaa</pre>
