"Feel me..."

"You just do what you gotta do, ooh yeah"

[Truck]
I'm on these streets all day, cuz I'm hungry, nigga
I sell drugs, duck thieves, a straight bummy nigga
You don't like me, then stay the fuck away from me, nigga
And watch my pockets get fat, like yours stay thin
Shorty hate my guts, I'm fucking her best friend
With a bad ass body, a right complexion
Plus I'm on now, a lot of doubts, they said I couldn't do it
But look at us now, Fred, I already knew it
Our day would come, it's our time to shine
Invest in entertainment companies, and clothing lines
Money's looking right, cuz all I do is chop chop
Bag up, smoke weed, then I'm hitting the block
Fiends looking for me all day, around the clock
Cuz I do what I got to do, soon I be riding through
H2, what's up nigga? Chromed out powder blue
Who's that? That's that boy from the New
Ruthless Bastardz, that's the rest of my crew, poo..

"You just do what you gotta do, ooh yeah"

[Truck]
You know there's one thing, that I never understood
How he's doing it for the hood, but he's never in the hood
Call himself a hustler, but his crack's no good
No money in the stash, nigga, that's no good
Big spender, you trick too much, you giving up hundreds
Just for a kiss and a touch
I ain't giving these bitches nothing but some dick in the gut
You feel me, homey, now pass the weed
So I can get my head right, nigga, yes, indeed
Listen, pa, I really don't know what you thinking
I'm trying to have a smokefest, like them dreds in Kingston
I'm what the streets need, who gives a fuck if you think not
Rap's up and coming, and my guns will pop

"You just do what you gotta do, ooh yeah"</pre>
