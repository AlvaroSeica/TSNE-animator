No contract, take my word

[Chorus]
 
[T.I.]
Ay, it's the King Young Gunna, hotter than a suana 
in the summer, nigga think I'm playin 'round if you wanna
Bring the thunder and the lightning like a sightin if you try me
on that Warren Buffet shit, that monkey shit behind me (Haaaa~!)
You want me, square nigga, you know where to find me
Don't call me on my cell, you tryna send a pimp to jail?
If you buyin twenty-five ,you can get it for the twelve
Uncut, rocked up, got tan, and pale, yeah!
Hey, let me send a lil' message to my enemies
Ya nigga get to tellin, have 'em buried 'fore they sentence me
Come to ATL, hit any trap t-they remember me
Billionnaire swag witta dope boy's energy
Chea..
 
[Chorus]
 
[Rick Ross]
Soft white, I got that G-mix!
I'm goin gold, crumbs to the bricks
(Uh!) I'm on the road, let's buy some NEW whips
Trick a hundred hoes, spend a few chips (RO-SAY!)
Nine piece, straight eight balls..
Bitch I'm blowin up like napalm (Whoo!)
Gotcha bottom bitch goin A.W.O.L.
Niggaz lookin at cha like you fell off
NO SIR -- NOT ME! (NOT ME!)

Bullet proof, nigga Teflon
