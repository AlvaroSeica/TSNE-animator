[1 N Only]
There ain't no stopping me, from making green
It's that top notch click, yeah that balling team
Things bout to pop off, like a bottle of Cristal
It ain't my fault, you memorize the whole style
It's hard not to push, that repeat track
It's what we do, cause we have you coming back
Flocks of hoes jock, with sex on they mind
The adventures in this game, when we out there on the grind
Make this name known, in your household
Made this town hot, when it was cold
You best know ain't no one realer, we heavy hitters
Off the chain records, bumping in your Navigators

[Hook - 2x]
It ain't my fault, that you bounce to this
Ain't no use is hating, blaze an ounce to this
It ain't my fault, if you bobbing your head
So listen up close, to these words I said

[James D 303]
Check my stilo, I'm bringing my skill yo
Do you feel it do you feel it, all up in your stereo
Boom boom boom, from your amplifiers
Bass so tight, turn that shit up higher
Kicking the flow, honeys in the front row
Big pimping, right after the show
At the Mo-mo, getting a little loco fo' sho
Letting pro, from the bed to the flo'
I'm that playa of the century, twisting up another beat
Suave Smooth faculty, James D 303
It ain't my fault, cause you loving it
It ain't my fault, cause my click is the shhh

[Hook - 2x]

[Troj Dogg]
Coming out hard, no regard for you haters
A word to the wise, don't cross the lines I ain't playing
Flossing our cars big boss, steady pimping
Hated by plenty loved my many, noble shitting
Only foreign words I spill, words flowing
I pop the Cristal, with a smile cause I'm potent
Now hoes on the jock ride the block, cause I'm stunting
Bobbing my head eyes red, cause I'm blunted
Could give a fuck less got no stress, on what you saying
See it in your eyes no surprise, I know you hating
Debating waiting, anticipating my final chapter
Troj Dogg laying it down it ain't my fault, I'm out pal
