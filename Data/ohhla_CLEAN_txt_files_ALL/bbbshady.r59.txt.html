New York, Jersey, Philly; New York, Jersey, Philly
New York, Jersey, Philly - you know I keep it filthy
Out in New York, Jersey, Philly; New York, Jersey, Philly
New York, Jersey, Philly - check it

Rockin spikes and a beater, beside me a diva
I'm hearin all the talk of how you ride with a heater
Make sure I don't survive but when I see ya
You +Sleep With a Broke Heart+, like you went and took advice from Alicia
Tell me if you really wanna take it there
Best in the world if you ain't remained aware
Latest gear, love nope, hate it yeah
You and your scared style'll get aired out, start stop and stare now
Change the truck's grille, yeah the car got veneers now
Lot of rappers spittin shit, I don't wan' hear now
They talkin Gucci but they shoppin at Sears now
If you weren't prepared now, you ain't get the warnin yet
So I'ma go hard early, call it mornin sex
New York, Jersey, Philly; New York, Jersey, Philly
New York, Jersey, Philly; tinted up, rims silly
If a nigga try and kill me, chalk it up as the brother whylin
Your mind playin tricks on you, get off Shutter Island
Showin you somethin you never would see, I'm gettin checks every week
You tryin to meet your executive needs, I'm in executive suites consecutively
Somebody had to body ya, guess the job was left to me
So when I kill the track they can't charge me with double jeopardy
They asked you if I'm a boss and you say "No sir"
How you don't concur? My gopher got a chauffeur
Standin on the couch in the club with a nympho
Reppin Slaughterhouse, see the blood on the window
I try and get wealthy, bein broke gettin healthy
So I ain't tryin to buy whatever shit they try and sell me
Got a broad up in the telly I could trust her what you tell me
Still bringin +Lunatics+ with me, yeah I learned that trick from Nelly
Cause I know that it get urgent, when they see you just splurgin
Strip club, in the private room tryin to fix the curtains
Wanna cause a big excursion, run up on the kid squirtin
Make sure the mac ain't broke and you ain't buy the Knicks version

Out in New York, Jersey, Philly; New York, Jersey, Philly

Nissan, Honda, Chevy - my stash is never empty baby
Nissan, Honda, Chevy; Nissan, Honda, Chevy
Nissan, Honda, Chevy - th-the D's will never get me

In my hoopty I be swervin, the public's who I'm servin
Boost phone forever chirpin, I'll be out there puttin work in
Know them dirty boys lurkin, if they nab me then it's curtains
So when I'll go see a person I spin the blocks so I'm certain
that it's cool, I'm no fool, see Raul is more than reckless
So I meet him when it's busy at that Meek or Morgan exit
Off that BQ, B-B-B-B-B-B-BQE near Mickey-D's
And occasionally treat myself to a nice little fish and cheese
I'm really really in the street, bein broke's my enemy
Teachers said I'm dumb but I dropped out and I know chemistry
I make that soft get hard
And meet my homie Pito in the parkin lot of Home Depot off Northen Boulevard
I got my route down packed, I'm about my stacks
And my mouth don't chat, I let my bout-bout clap
But I ain't with that though, I'm tryin to get that dough (yaowa)
Beamer, Benz or Bentley? Oh no, I stay low

In that Nissan, Honda, Chevy; Nissan, Honda, Chevy

Pistol clip and pistol - that's all I rap about
It's my pistol clip and pistol, pistol clip and pistol
Pistol clip and pistol - that's all I rap about bitch

My dick is like a missile, my pistol's in my pants
But my dick is hangin lower than my pistol clip and pistol bitch
Now we talkin 'bout my dick, you know yo' shit big
when your bitch give you head and her mouth is only 'round the top of it
Now let's talk about my pistol clip
If the gun is playin music than the pistol clip's the instrument
The soldier holdin onto the fo'-fo's composin
The drummer's BRRRRRRRRRRRR, 7-6-2's explodin
I'm about to stop talkin 'bout my dick, pistol and my pistol clip
Dick, pistol, pistol clip, bitch, I'm a hypocrit
If you say, fuck the world that mean that I'm literally
tryin to put my big, big dick in it
My, pistol clip, pistol whistlin {*whistling to the beat*}
... I hope you listenin
Pistol clip, pistol big dick, now your bitch is interested
I'm 'bout to enter it and injure it
I am not indirect, I am so motherfuckin BLUNT
Pistol clip, pistol dick, BITCH!
I'm sayin - you like, "Oh my God, get that gun out of my face"
It's not in yo' face, it's in my hand

Pistol clip and pistol

Tequila, vodka, Henny
Tequila, vodka, Henny - that liquor fuckin with me
It's tequila, vodka, Henny; tequila, vodka, Henny
Tequila, vodka, Henny - that liquor fuckin with me

Yeah I'm nickels dimes and pennies, I'm dollars fives and twenties
And I'm twenties fifties Benji's; buy Beamers, Benz and Bentleys
Buy bullets, guns and semis; buy Louie, Gucci, Fendi
Fuck Wendy's, Mickie's, Denny's; I'm Morton's, Chow's and Benny's

Patrón, Cîroc and Remy, some weed, shrooms and pilly's
Now we loco, loony, silly; fuck they mouth, box and titty
{"Umm, she is licking the shaft of the penis."}
That's brains, breast and kitty, while I'm drunk, fried and tipsy
While I'm twisted high and dizzy, pussy juicy hot and pretty
Gushy, gooey, sticky, gushy, gooey, sticky
Bitch I'm Eazy, 'Pac and Biggie off tequila, vodka, Henny
Spit like Wayne, 'Ye and Drizzy mixed with Em, Jay and 50
In my Nissan, Honda, Chevy, my pistol clip and pistol grip
Rappers got a bigger buzz, bitch I got a bigger dick
That was my Royce line
I'm on my Cali, Brooklyn, Jersey and Detroit time
(Slaughterhouse) Them boys grind
We goin past the top, so Mount Everest won't cut it
You low budget, we 'bout to go public

Tequila, vodka, Henny; tequila, vodka, Henny
Tequila, vodka, Henny - that liquor fuckin with me
It's tequila, vodka, Henny; tequila, vodka, Henny
Tequila, vodka, Henny - that liquor fuckin with me</pre>
