[Verse 1]
uh, feel like the sky is the limit and nuthin

they say the star life is addictive and me
I'm so high I'm flyin defying physics
I'm wearin hundered dollar draws no flaws
wizzel on a hands free call young boss (the young boss)
blackberry ringin, side kick buzzin
got ma money right, can't tell me nuthin
if I said I wasent all in, I be lieing like a lady who's fallin
chain sick and the watch face swollen
see me now wish I'd go back to tha old him
but wizzel won't change for tha world...
I live life fast and any day could be your last
blow ten stacks and go need get it back in a hour

[Chorus: x2]
they say you get out whatcha put into it so my all's what I give (i give)
and I don't just talk about the life of a star homie that's what I live (live)
and the niggaz that I'm with hustle heavy (heavy)

[Verse 2]

the high life yee thass ma life need it's possible to die twice
but chu only live once so I'm a live it up

[Chorus]
they say you get out whatcha put into it so my all's what I give (i give)
and I don't just talk about the life of a star homie that's what I live (live)
and the niggaz that I'm with hustle heavy (heavy)

(family)
