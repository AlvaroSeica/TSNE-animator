Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus]
When it's drought season, I ain't got nothing to do
Instead of running the streets with my niggaz, I'ma stay home with my boo
Cause it's no work, so baby call in
And let this freaky shit begin, for real I'm all in
When it's drought season, I ain't got nothing to do
Instead of running the streets with my niggaz, I'ma stay home with you
Cause it's no work, so baby call in
And let the freaky shit begin, for real I'm all in

[Mike D]
I ain't had no work, in about two weeks
Cause shit can get hectic, when you can't find keys
Cause I'm more addicted to birds, then laying with bops
Cause on my block, it be rolling nonstop
But this be the season, when niggaz go to the top
They shit go pop, clean house like a mop
Mayn fuck with a cop, from drop it's some rich benefits
Versacci outfits, flying round with a freak-nic
Big balling and crawling, cross the state line
Bring the U-Hauling, more blocks get bombarded
Cause we don't plan on falling, we smashing the game
Ain't no stalling ain't no stunting, just big face and dope game
Paying over twenty thousand, for a bird black
You want a choice, me a penny over your jack
It's just like that, motherfucker
Cause slipping and tripping by this time, you a dead motherfucker

[Chorus]

[H.A.W.K.]
Well the sky's the limit, to the money you making
The chances you taking, the rules you breaking
Confiscating, bringing home the bacon
The cakes you baking, the nuts you taking
Niggaz be hating, perpetrating
Devils like Satan, got me mistaken
Bunch of admiration, for the things that you do
Go on take a day off, so I can ball with you
My baby boo, ooh girl ooh I like that
Gon' turn around, and let me hit it from the back
Crying exact, after the sex we can relax
And calculate the interest, on our property tax
Fetty's a fact, either way it's gon' be there
Once we make grace, while you stroke through my hair
The love we share, is the meaning of a pair
And to that baby, nothing can compare

[Chorus]

[Big Steve]
Taking her with me early, for moving my work
Drought season, make a nigga feel it right where it hurt
You scurred, gotta wreck from at the end of the day
Serious about you, when I wanna parlay
Let me hit it from the back, like you like me to do it
Talk to a nigga dirty, while I'm making you lose it
When my cheese low, I'm in the pad freaking
Big ol' thick ass, long haired Puerto Rican
Calling me papi, loving my body rock
I'm a Southside player, and you know it don't stop
I'ma slide in the drop, pick up my shop
Straight from the nail shop, cause I'm fiending for cot
I love them big ol' red hoes, with a beautiful smile
Shake em up knock em down, in a mansion a while
I'm a big ol' boss player, cookie dough maker
Love to fuck my bitch, in the waters of Jamaica
