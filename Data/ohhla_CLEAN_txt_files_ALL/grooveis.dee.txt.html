[Lady Miss Kier] 
(we're going to dance and have some fun) 
the chills that you spill up my back keep me filled 
with satisfaction when we're done 
satisfaction of what's to come 
I couldn't ask for another 
no, I couldn't ask for another (you know that's right) 
your groove I do deeply dig 
no walls, only the bridge 
my sucker dish, my sucatash wish (sing it, baby) 
I couldn't ask for another (un huh, un huh) 
no, I couldn't ask for another 

[Chorus] 
groove is in the heart 
groove is in the heart 
groove is in the heart 
groove is in the heart 

[Lady Miss Kier] 
(watch out) 
the depth of who to groove 
moves me too, I'm seein' who 
we're going through too, hard nasty, who woo 
I couldn't ask for another 
no, I couldn't ask for another 
DJ Soles, it's time to roll 
I've been told, he can't be sold 
he's not vicious or malicious 
just lovely and delicious 
I couldn't ask for another 

[Q-Tip] 
unh, some looks in this torso 
hot, got a deal, you wanna know? 
the live of true and delightful 
makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show 
feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze 
music makes mostly moves like a maze 
all inside of me, heart especially 
note of the rhythm, where I wanna be 
flowin', glowin' with electric guys 
you dip to the dive, baby yo, realize 
when will you see the funky side of me? 
baby, you'll see that rhythm is a key 
get, get, wit' it, wit' it 
can't think, quit it, quit it 
stomp on the streets when I hear a funk beat 
playin' pop like follow hoods true 
baby, just sing about the groove 
(sing it) 

[Chorus] 

[Q-Tip] 
(one, two, three) 
blow them, blow them horns 
(the groove is in your heart) 

[Chorus]</pre>
