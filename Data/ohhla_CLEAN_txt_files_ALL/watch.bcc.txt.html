Excuse me, excuse me
I be the poetry man that was sent here by the WWBCC fanclub
You called the number 1-900-GET-DA-BOOT and you asked the question
What is the world coming to 
How come nature hasnt changed us
How come we havent learned so many things 
Things that rearrange our brains make us think insane
See we were sent here on a mission
A particular one this plan that was sent 
That was brodcast across the planet earth
So to let you know open your eyes realize
Reps, sayin? Suuweee

Chorus:

Rock:Yo watch yo step baby
Louieville: Watch where ya walk
Rock: When its time for some action
Louie: Yo these reps dont talk
Rock: That first steps a doosy
Louie: So watch where ya walk
Rock: When its time for action
Louie: Real heads dont talk

Check this
I press this nigga next on my checklist
Get restless bring it where ya rest son di-tect it SEE
I gets hectic when these reps run through your set bitch
No diggy 
Soon we bring it to crews a fifty 
Se it be be niggas that make it shitty in ya city 
A sound simply pounds leaving your grounds empty
You just cant convince me
That you got what it takes TO
Swim in a tank of sharks become bait
Face 5-8 inches are better, however 
Supreme, means I bring things ya cant measure
Bring bad weather, like Starang, Louie and D.O.
See we blow muthafuckas to rubbish like we C-4

Were known to be triple R rated but gets down for dough
To of the first to hit the scene and the last to go
Move slow if you got the heart to get blazed
By the double one mac when you react and get laid
Leave yo back sprayed, attack fade turn your naps gray
Move yo monkey ass fore I let this fuckin gat play
Melodies thatll mash your mainframe 
To bring forth and understand then know why these two niggas came
Get yo body stained my shottys plain far from complex
Been trained by the realer soldiers, gods and the non
But the bomb threat
Has yet to be confirmed 
Shoulda learned that we de-bone these cats like big worm 

Chorus:

Rock: Watch your step baby
Louie: Watch where you walk
Rock:  When its time for action
Louie: Yo these reps dont talk
Rock:  That first steps a doosy
Louie: So watch where you walk
Rock: When its time for some action
Louie: Real heads dont talk

Alright here goes the submission holder MC folder
Scold ya supreme sting teams Rock the boulder
Yes I shoulda told ya 
We bomb crews like Oklahoma
Dont come any closer
Leave those creepers sleepin in comas
Playtimes over, draw ya toaster from ya hoster
Roast ya then watch them fall like October
It gets colder, than January
Shoulda ran already 
Too late crews break cuz they still aint ready
Aint steady 
Defeat the weak who speak petty
I sting you with lingual sharp like a machete
Prepare to meet your maker
Wont hesitate to break a snake up 
Bomb crews like Arnold then Ill berate ya

These rebels are dissatisfied
So many dead so many battlecries
So many things that change so many niggas try
To end me cuz envy has taken over
So many fake thugs so many slugs this shit gets colder
As I got older had plans to roll like boulder
And flip the whole set cuz cash wreck for all my souljahs
I fumble a well nigga that shelves who have to tumble
Before I get locked and blow the spot like Bryant Gumble
Prepare to rumble we servin justice now must this
Nigga get open like a leakhead wit a dutch spliff
Now fuck this these reps are-a 
No need to crush shit when I touch shit 
I make this shit more spicier than mustard

Ahh ohh ahh	
(Now hold on hold on son just cool out)
Ahh ohh ahh 
(Breath in breath out)
Ahh ohh ah
(These fashion punk niggas got a dick in they mouth)
Ahh oohh ahh
(Word is bon Jovi aint none of yall boys bag out all hash)
Ahh ohh ahh
(Word)
