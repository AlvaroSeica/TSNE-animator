Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Nick Cannon]
All jokes is savage, it lies your eyes every time I smile
While, as a child at the core, gotta spit these pearls to my unborn
Poems 'till they get into this world!
Show 'em how to fit into this world
Knowing unless you're gonna make a difference you ain't shit in this world
Excuse my language, damn, I guess I'm just anxious!
Man, it take away all the suffering, pain, hatred and anguish!
This place is dangerous, we're entertainers
But so many of our angels have fallen and walk with Satan
But don't be too religious, cause that's just a business
I hate to say this, but it is what it is..
Ya al just can't live what we live
Is gonna be individuals, be negative
They gonna hate your skin tone, hate your income
Hate your homes and even hate on your mom
Hate on me for making this song
But you are not alone..

[Sade]
There is a woman in Somalia
Scraping for pearls on the roadside
There's a force stronger than nature
Keeps her will alive
That's how she's dying
She's dying to survive
Don't know what she's made of
I would like to be that brave!
She cries to the Heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives a life she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes!
Hurts like brand-new shoes!

[Nick Cannon]
Ya'll are covered by the father
And your mother's one of the greats
And when I meet you in person I'm gonna say this to your face
My daughter, be careful! But my son, go harder in the pain
... no chaser, but only tasted the moderation!
I ain't never drink, but this is a celebration
So I'm toasting with potions that keep endorphins open
Lord knows I'm hopin' that you embrace my mistakes
That I have yet to make
And I thank you beforehand as I accept your grace
Your hands I can't wait to cast my pearls among saints

[Sade]
There is a woman in Somalia
The sun gives her no mercy
The same sky we lay under
Burns her to the bone
Long as afternoon shadows
It's gonna take her to get home
Each grain carefully wrapped up
Pearls for her little girl

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives a life she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes</pre>
