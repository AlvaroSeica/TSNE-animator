Intro: Shogun Assasson

Cause, we unite to fight
For one commom cause
Is you down for the cause?
Or you down just because?

Verse One: Shogun Assasson

By dawns or the light
We unite and fight
One common cause, to inforce Allah's laws
Bombs burst in the air, light up the night like stars
As a rocket flare, I prepare for warfare
Destroying all the devil's ideas, while cowards run in fear
Thre's no retreating, no surrender
No victory, no peace, till the enemy is deceased
And the beast, cease to exist, from being devilish
Running from amongst us, only in God do I trust
So I bust to leaving bodies lying in the dust
Soldiers dying in their own iniquity,
And hell is the penalty

Kung Fu sample:
"I wanna join you; I'll show youwhat I've learned
Please be frank and use your judgement"

[9th Prince]
Yeah, yo, yo yo
Revenge of the fallen patriot
enemies die, I civilized with hatred
The Undertaker, rugged like a Trailblazer
Lost crusader, a vador for a lifesaver
Niggas is computer mind truth
Trained to kill
Lyrical swords and battle for navy seals
Death team motions are calm like the ocean
9th Prince Golden Child Was Chosen
was the warrior slogan
Back to the future my father was killed by Lucifer
Now I'm here to avenge his death
Call me the Shaolin Executioner
I execute dig into the brain
and split the main vein
Mow ya bloodline is short circuit
What is teh verdict on those who got murdered
I researched it, now I'm allergic
He was killed by the lyrical surgic
Verbal villian, I heal myself with herbal healing
Then step out the blue mountain
on the mission of a killing
