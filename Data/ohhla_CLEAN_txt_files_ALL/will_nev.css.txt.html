(uh uh)
na na na na na... na na na na na na  (uh uh)
(uh uh)
na na na na na... na na na na na na

(Chorus: Cassidy + female voice)
If the D.A. ask me to tell I'm like (uh uh)
They like you want to go back to jail I'm like (uh uh)
Upstate with the inmates and C.O.'s no (uh uh)
I like to clap gats but my P.O. like (uh uh)

I stood in jail, I will never tell (uh uh)
Get the deal, I will never squeal (uh uh)
I wanna walk, But I never talk (uh uh)
And that's that, I will never rat (uh uh)

(Verse 1: Cassidy)
Blow the fuckin whistle, I'm on my fuckin grissle
Tryin to make a dollar out a dime and a fuckin nickle
I'll knuckle wit you, But I got a couple pistols
If they fuckin hit You You'll be dead or fuckin crippled
I'm just fuckin wit you, I ain't gon bust a pistol
Cuz I'm on parole and I aint tryin to get fuckin pickled
I call my gat acrobat, Cuz it'll fuckin' flip you
Stuff you in a box like some fuckin' tissue
If you cats got 9 lives, I hope you brought a couple wit you
Or you won't live, your relatives gonna fuckin' miss you
If you a rat I aint fuckin' wit you, I wouldn't even
tell if I seen Bin Laden buyin' a fuckin' missle
If you a snitch I'll come and get you, Take your life
and the life of the rest of the mice runnin' wit you
You pack gats then I'm fuckin' wit you, But if you
live by the gun you gon die by the fuckin' pistol

(Chorus)

(Verse 2: Cassidy)
You ain't a killa yet, you ain't a gorilla yet
I bang like I'm at the rage and you could be the silhouette
Yea I'm still a threat, you could still feel het
The led put you to bed cuz you soft like a pillow set
You pussys asleep, I'll put you to sleep
The bullets I put in the heat it'll put your face on ya feet
You could look in my face and see you facin' defeat
It's basically beef, Dont let me see your face in the street
You betta stand on the payment, you ain't safe in the street
I'm flippin' weight in the street, I get cake in the street
So what you make in a year I could make in a week
Or probaly a couple hours, I'm gettin a couple dollars
All I'm doin is takin a beat, And then speakin' the
truth on it like Doctor King makin' a speech
Man you snitches coversate wit police, But theres a
difference betweent a lake and a beach and a grape and a peach...
motherfucker

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Cassidy)
I said you cats rats like the master on ninja turtles
I was bein nice, Cuz y'all mice bout as big as gerbals
little hamster, guinea pig type niggas
Who be givin information to the pigs with the quickness
Them kids snitches, They'll try to ride against you
Then sign a subpoena and testify against you
Go to jail NEVA THAT
Take a deal NEVA THAT
Squeal NEVA THAT
THATS THAT I WILL NEVA RAT

(Chorus)</pre>
