the west-coast warlord
the grime wizard
Ice Cube
motherfucking head so big they
call him jack n the box

{1st verse}
I'm a superhero, like Lou Ferrigno
maybach deniro, look like a zero
Shine the spotlight, this is my night
Get your camera's ready, let it rain confetti
I'm a champion, I do what can't be done
in the real league nerd not the fantasy one
Throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy
when I hit the stage get a ear full of noise
when I bring the noise from here to Illinois
motherfuckers love when I do what it does
I'm all-star, superstar entertainer
world class, first ballad hall of famer
some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger
how when your lyrics were written by a stranger
fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest
I'm loved by your grandmamma, and your babies

{Chorus}
See my head is so big they call me jack n the box
you can't impress me, so fuck what you got
I say my head is so big they call me jack n the box
don't talk about money cause I'm stacking a lot

Shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause I was sent to the world, by G O D
Shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause I was sent to the world, by G O D

{2nd verse}
I was a born loser, I was a born sinner
now I am a winner, in the convention centre
I got to take a bow, cause I still wonder how
the system didn't get me when I was a juvenile (just think)
just think if I had got locked up
no "Boyz N Tha Hood" thanks to America
no easy N.W.A. no "Friday"
Don't let ya motherfucking talent go to waste
Don't catch a case cause these people got a place
to throw your life away and take you right out the waist
throw your hands up, you got to man up
I had to show the world, what I was made of
what you say blood, I was a slave cuz
now I'm VIP, up in Vegas
I'm up in Nike town, so how you like me now
see the whole industry had to bite my style

{Chorus}
See my head is so big they call me jack n the box
I knew we would win, so I'm bragging a lot
I say my head is so big they call me jack n the box
my shit is so dope, it's like cracking a pop

Shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause I was sent to the world, by G O D
Shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause I was sent to the world, by G O D

{Bridge 2x}
Now mama don't be mad, I got to show my ass
and thank these motherfuckers for my past
I got to let them know I never brake like glass (never)
what you looking at is top notch world class

{Chorus}
See my head is so big they call me jack n the box
you can't impress me, so fuck what you got
I say my head is so big they call me jack n the box
don't talk about money cause I'm stacking a lot

Shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause I was sent to the world, by G O D
Shine that light on me, put that light on me
cause I was sent to the world, by G O D</pre>
