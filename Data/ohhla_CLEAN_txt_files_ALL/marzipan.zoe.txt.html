Song:   Marzipan
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Verse One: Eric Roberson]
To know you is to need you
To write you and read you
To see you is to want you
to somehow confront you
But I know the dangers
of having what my heart beats so much of
I know the dangers of love

[Chorus: Phonte]
My sweet marzipan
You come as fast as you can
of love's sweetest candy, why waste it? 
You might not taste it again

[Verse Two: Eric Roberson]
To know you is to fear you
I've got to be near you
You shook me, and saved me
with love that you gave me
You gave me a reason
to get up in the morning
You gave me a reason to smile

[Chorus]

{guitar and horn solo}

[Verse Three: Eric Roberson]
To know you is to love
Place nothing above you
You have me, you hold me
You bought me and sold me
But I know the dangers
of having what my heart beats so much of
I know the dangers of love

[Chorus]</pre>
