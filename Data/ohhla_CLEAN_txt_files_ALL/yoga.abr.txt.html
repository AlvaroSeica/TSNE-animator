Yo man I ever told you bout my girl?
Nah, why?
Yo she be doin some yoga, man

[Chorus]
My girl, she be doin yoga
She be doin yoga
She be doin yoga, y-yoga
With your girl
She be doin yoga
They be doin yoga
We be doin yoga, y-yoga

[Verse 1]
She doin yoga
Don't need a chauffer
Cuz I'm drivin
It aint over till we both smiling
We're so sober
But she's high and I like to hoaver
I mean hover and covers they in a pile and
The sheets are messed up
Pillows flyin
Ain't nothin dryin this room right now
We stay up, while we lie down
And we laid up even though it's nice out
After we ride in, she gonna ride out
I pull my mic out
She check one two
Then she bout to go down like the sun do
I'm the finish line I'm the one she run to
And if she trip up? Edit undo
99 lies, well maybe one true
So whatchu wanna do?
So whatchu wanna do?

[Chorus]
My girl, she be doin yoga
She be doin yoga
She be doin yoga, y-yoga
With your girl
She be doin yoga
They be doin yoga
We be doin yoga, y-yoga

[Verse 2]
I walk into her crib
Like where the sofa at?
I notice that there's just a yoga mat, holy crap
She touches toes and
She call me Moses
I say I'm Abraham
She said shut the fuck up
She goes into a pose and I'm supposed to do what?
She shows that she can make both of her kneecaps touch the back of her butt
Every child knows
The happy child pose
She said, "Down Dog."
And my smile froze
She said, "No silly it's easy."
I said, "Oh yeah? Prove it."
She said, "You're stupid, you just watch, I'll do it."
So now she bendin and twistin
Perfecting precision
She looked at me and I said, "I respect your fitness."
She got persistence
I'm lucky enough to be a witness
But I'm acting like a Jewish kid on Christmas
What is this?
Enough of this distance
Ready or not here I come
But I didn't stretch enough so I think I sprained my thumb

[Chorus]
My girl, she be doin yoga
She be doin yoga
She be doin yoga, y-yoga
With your girl
She be doin yoga
They be doin yoga
We be doin yoga, y-yoga
My girl, she be doin yoga
She be doin yoga
She be doin yoga, y-yoga
With your girl
She be doin yoga
They be doin yoga
We be doin yoga, y-yoga</pre>
