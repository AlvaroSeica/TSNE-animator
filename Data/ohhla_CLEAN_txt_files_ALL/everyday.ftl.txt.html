[Airplane]- Taking off
[Singer]- Uh no, everyday in every way

     Verse one
Gettin' paid, never caught in a raid
you get sprayed, prayed over and laid down
pump wit the pound, how that sound
death befo it's time, it's pretty much
the studio sound, wit the city touch
I put dimes on ya, commit crime on ya
when I get the drop, you got my shines on ya
and deadly yacht, so I never get shot
and this shit so hot, watch it resurrect 'pac
I got more ways, then some niggas out of state
and I just hate, when fake doppers throw ?
on my dick, chillin' wit the bitch I ate
tradin' my thirty-eight, for a fresh nickel plate
It's a shooty thang, blowin' ya hood wit mighty bang
wit the outlaws thugs, in the clubs, where hotties hang
I know you know, give it up son, slow ya roll
I throw'em slow, they gonna be the next flow

     Chorus
[Singer]-Everyday
[Fatal]- I bring it to yall, and never know yall
when ya flip this shit, get thick
the hollow points, run through ya
this outlaw clout, got them thuggs odin'
the slugs go seein', you cowards supposed to be in
[Singer]- Everynight
[Fatal]- The whole shit, bring ya bold click
I got a whole clip, I fold chips
and blast, to leave ya sould rip
money over bitches, til my casket drop
I'm reservin' all you niggas, since I mashed with 'pac
thugged out I'm dyin, Huessin the don
It's all about the Benjies, why get friendly,semi
nasty new, more then vary, blast ya crew
more to bury, nigga what
the dog in this, dog in this, what's the prob
my outlaw thugs, on a mission to robb
everyday, problems gettin' sloved kinda critical
It's pitiful, all this shit political

    Verse two
You wanna be a playa?
let me show ya how
You wanna be a thug?
change ya style, blah
walk pass ya ass, wit the house of ditty-ness
when ya blast I laugh, like oh my god
did he miss? cuz, yall kids fold cold, in all biz
get money off small shit, hands off the ruff roll wit it
so simple, we can kick it but get no mple
co went the dilly, you droppin wit foes simple

     Chorus
[Singer]- Everyday, ahhha ahhha, everyday
and everyway, ohhhhhhhhh ohhh
[Backround]- Everynigh(hold note)
Everynight, said I'm tryin' to do whats right
ahhhhhhh oohhhhhh

     Verse three
Wilin', kinda play ya like Veit shine
bomb on ya fake soilders, you know the time
shine on ya like a rolly, you can't hold me
number one parolly, catchin' hits like a goalie
jump from jeerz, while New York gettin' money
E-three-twenty, wit a down to die honey
beef all ova, naw never in a millon years
hold ya tears, put ya hands on the ceilin'
cross ya over boss, and toss you off course
bow down ya lost, droppin' Fatal tryin' floss
do ya real dirty, when playas bein' tryin' to serve me
throw the skirts in the air, give it up to jersey 
got mo you betta sip it, for the rowdy niggas get cha
and hit cha, wit some shit ya peoples can't even picture
a thug in the club, with a caliber snub
I know you hate to throw it up, throw it up out of ya love

     Chorus
[Singer]- everyday and every way
haayyyyyyy ahhhhhh yaaaa oh oh no
[Backround]- Everynight(hold note)
[Singer]- every every night, let me hear ya say
