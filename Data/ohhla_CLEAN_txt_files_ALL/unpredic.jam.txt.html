Yeah ladies I know you tired of the same old thing
Things have become so mundane
I mean your bedroom is so cold, so cold but I'm here to tell you
I got a strategy we bout to heat it up (oh I like that)

[Chorus]
Girl get comfortable we bout to do something you never done before
Baby not the usually tonight we gettin unpredictable
So tryyy to roll wit me baby... baby
I'm a make you feel like you never felt
Girl all because you let me get unpredictable

[Verse 1]
Baby 1 plus 1 ain't 2 when you wit me
C A F to A and B when you wit me
It don't make sense right now but it will
Later on when you see how I make you feeeel

When it comes to love makin be the real special-nary
Precision girl pick one better yet two
Never mind that we tryin all the fun Soooo

[Chorus]

Wake you up in the middle of the night and take you to another world
You'll wake up in the mornin feelin like another giiirl
