[Intro]
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhhh
Just a, just a, just a dream
All a dream, it's all it's all
Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a dream

[Frank Ocean]
From my Lou's I'm seeing colors
Turquoise, ocean green, hurricane silver, yeah
I'm falling, down a well
Wish you were the water there
Just like a sun without a flame, fell asleep without a dream
I saw the light fade, I let it drift away
I'm in that air and it's hard to breathe
Gravity won't hold my feet - how'd I let my love breathe?

[Chorus]
I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning flick flick flicker in a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lightning flick flick flicker in a little glass bottle
Got to save, save me
I know you seen me fall, I know you willin to die
Save, save me
My life is in that glass, my life is in that bottle
Wake up - just tell me that's it's all in my head
Wake up - remind me that you're still in my bed
Wake up - the thought of sleeping in my arms again
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

[Frank Ocean]
I'm in Emerald City, lookin for wizard Oz
Maybe he could tell me the way
to your heart again
I click my J's 3 times wishin she woulda stayed
And then I put her, put her on a plane, found a diamond for your ring
The crown's on Saturn, then I'm back in L.A
I woke up, she ain't there, levitating off the mattress
Baby where you atvI said, oh baby where you at?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's all a dream, it's all all all it's {*2X*}
It's just a dream
Just a just a dream
My life is in that glass
Save, save me</pre>
