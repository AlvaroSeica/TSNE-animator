[Sean Price]
Uh-huh, yeah, P!!
Yo, listen

Niggaz can not hide, niggaz can not shine
Confidential informant-ass niggaz should not rhyme
The truth come out, niggaz corny in the booth come out
Switch your career, you still queer, look at your gear
Be the Boot Camp champion Sean, Rodney King rappers
cryin sayin "Can't we all get along?
Got a rap, got a stack, can we all get a song?"
Hell no, variety show flows get gonged
Chuck Rathers, y'all niggaz can't fuck with Ruck Tragic
Barry Bond BALCO arm, get gone savage, uhh
So sharp, the flow is so NARC
Throw darts that'll knock ock off of a go-cart (don't start)
Shit, I ain't tryin to start trouble
Tryin to 'keloid your face, snake and raise bubbles
Uhh, hail men, my nigga you're never gone
Reincarnated through me, P! Megasean, uhh

Yeah nigga
Decepticon Sean in the building bitch
Matter fact... my new name, my new name is Megasean
Y'knahmean?
I started off, as Scragbite
I went from Scragbite, to Ruckus
I went from Ruckus to Decepticon Sean
But NOW, I'm Megasean
Address me as such
or get fucked up - P!!</pre>
