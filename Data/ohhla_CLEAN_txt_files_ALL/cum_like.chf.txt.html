[Intro: Popa Chief]
Aiyo, baby, take that back, take that back
You know I like my biscuits burnt
You know how I like my bus burnt
Don't be bringing that to me like that
What you think this is? Lintball, beat it
Yo, yo, yo, yo, this is for my thugs
Like to wild out and bug
Pull niggas feets from under rugs
The hot honeys, loving shaking it, at parties

[Popa Chief]
Yo, check the footprint twelve inches, black &amp; blue monkey wrenches
Don't make me clear the benches on you generic
Play the 2 karat, cubix lyrics
Still four-tracking it? No budget
Battle stations, I die for my occupation
The only way ya'll bust is pre-mature ejaculation
Some of ya'll think ya'll thug cuz ya'll learned Tae Bo
Too many woodies in the kitchen for the gumbo
Plans and dreams on the mount, to the hiller beans
If you don't execute your scheme, why'd you choose your scheme?
I only walk with kings and queens
And do the illest of things

[Chorus 2X: Popa Chief]
I cum like a riot, all my broke niggas be quiet
All my ugly chickens be quiet
You been on this hip hop diet, for too long
I be the bomb, you better buy it

[Popa Chief]
Aiyo, I rock to the beat, of a different drum
Immensely toke an L, the size of my thumb
Ain't too proud to snatch a crumb, soon as they pile up
That's when everybody want some
Respect the slums, that's where some of the illest cats come from
Popa Chief, poetry in motion
No mishaps or mistakes, even my wack raps hold weight
I rock the boat in happy stakes
Fucking with Uncle Sam is how I caught my first gold plate
It's a family trait, choose my own fate
Fill your trap up with bait, squatted and wait, how bout that?
Looky, looky, looky, wack MC's caught in a mouse trap

[Chorus 2X]

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
I get weight from Joey Crack, shoot you with this mack ten
Stack my Timbs, here's a lens for you wack MC's, blind Mister Magoo's
I'm 'boyz-in-the-hood' like Ice Cube, I get drunk
With the Alkaholik crew, me and LL, we cop some free Fubu
Lil' Kim? I pregnate her, make a little Oakland Raider
Ice-T? Showed me how to be a pimp player
Too Short, showed me his first American Express card
Charlie Baltimore, that bitch kept my dick hard
Me, Red and Meth? We smoked until we seen stars
I bumped into Big Ten and the Magnificent Seven
Bought them all slurpees at 7/11
I heard Adina Howard want to fuck me, but I didn't fuck her
I thought she had herpes, I bought her a bottle of verdy
Went in early, even though I'm freaky, like Mr. Firley
I slap a mic like Moe, did Larry, and Larry did Curly

[Popa Chief]
The old bull said to the young
Son, don't run down the hill and fuck one
Walk down, and fuck 'em all, it's a half pass the monkey's ass
And a quarter til we ball, yes ya'll

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
