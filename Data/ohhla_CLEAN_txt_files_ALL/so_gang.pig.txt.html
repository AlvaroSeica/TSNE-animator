[Chorus: Pigeon John and April Hendrix]
I'm a gangster for real, I feel so damn gangster
I'm a gangster for real...
I'm a gangster for real, I feel so damn gangster
I'm a gangster for real...

[Pigeon John]
Check it, mmmhmmm
It's just one of those days, I feel the sunrise around me
All the clouds ran away, huh somethin funny's goin on
(Okay) Okay, now where's all the traffic?
(Hmm) Is someone tryin to clown me?
Why do I feel fantastic? I'm used to things always goin wrong
But now...

[Chorus]

[Pigeon John]
Sittin in my backyard, lookin at a little squirrel
I'm drinkin some coffee, feel like a whole different world
Plus I got the bomb rhyme skills
I GOT HAWTHORNE BACKIN ME UP
(Hmm) Plus my wife looks good
I got butter soft seats all up in my truck!
Yup, yup, I'm bangin some Depeche Mode
Windows down so you can see my fresh mode
Yeah my six-fo' is only a Nintendo
But I'm smashin fools on some Super Mario
Never pictured myself sittin on some big dough
Used to +Singing the Blues+ on +6th and Alvarado+
I'm chillin in the back of The Belt chewing tacos
I feel like young Sean Connery in Cabo

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Breakdown) Act like you in Cabo
Let me take you out
We'll go to Denny's on Vermont
and we'll get waffles on the house, yeah
Act like you in Cabo
Let me take you out
We'll go to Denny's on Vermont
and we'll get waffles on the house, yeah
Because we cold

[Pigeon John]
Check it, watch the young Duke Ellington make the place gelatin
Shake the fake falligant, I''m the black Gilligan
that keep seekin, keep reachin, the seas peekin
Keep reapin, keep breathin, the same reason 
I leave venom, every time I choose to spit 'em
in a line, hit 'em, with an unusual rhythm
That you never heard taht some of the words that are spoken
Forever hurtin those who oppose, I'm not jokin cause now...

[Chorus]</pre>
