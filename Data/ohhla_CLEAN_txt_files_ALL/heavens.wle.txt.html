[Intro: Wale]
In the grand scheme of things we never were supposed to have shit
Born to lose, built to win
Folarin, let's get it in.. look
We ain't supposed to never have nothin', we ain't supposed to never have shit
You see the growth in my rhymes and you see my focus ain't on them
Nah, at the top is just us, hah
Let's get it, okay

[Wale]
PRPs or some dunks you ain't on (yeah) Givenchy, but no kilt, mi amor (nah)
We can't leave, for we love the allure, hold mine down and stay above what you on
On, I'm appeased and obliged; Scorpio freaks quantity Gemini (WOO~!)
I'mma need me a light, ridin' through the cap, Cap STEEZ on the mind
Though, I ain't know him but I wish I did; each one, teach one, may the youth live
On that, Joey Bad please hold your head, lost one last summer, livin' ain't fair
While them niggas scared, we forever here (here) hate to see you smile, money everywhere (where)
Dream killers out, I see them in the rear, before I put them in a song, put them in a prayer
Amen (amen)

[Chorus: Wale]
Cause we ain't posed to never have shit (have shit) - yeah
We ain't 'posed to never (we ain't 'posed to never) - nah
We ain't supposed to never have nothin', we ain't supposed to never have shit
You see the growth in my rhymes and you see my focus ain't on them

[unknown singer]
No-ohhhh-whooooooa... {*4X*}

[Wale]
Look, look, look
Yeah, I'm focused, it's Folarin here, I reckon your barbershop talk of this
Heavenly father, may the spirit of God help whoever at odds get your guidance quick
All we need is Keisha (yeah) all we need is Becky (yeah) all we need is God (yeah) and fed free fetti (yeah)
My little buddy livestrong, young nigga peddle, he ain't make it in the leagues, so the streets wet him
Gettin' wet up on the corner in whatever weather (hush) before see the jail again, he gonna see the devil (ahhh)
Been a week since he seen his mother, uh, and 18 since he seen the other
I'mma pray for him, it's safe to say, he got some pain within
It ain't too much that I can say to him cause my bank statement don't relate to him
Look.. Ralph!

[Chorus: Wale]
We ain't never posed to never have nothin' (have nothin') - yessir, that's right
Cause we ain't posed to never have shit (have shit) - nope, no
We ain't never posed to never have nothin', yeah
You see my focus ain't on them

[Meek Mill]
I was so fresh, so clean when I stepped on that scene, pulled up Aston Martin, you could ask them ya'll seen
When I came through this bitch, paper tagging on lean; baddest bitch in the game, nigga that was ya'll dream
Hold up, let me get a feel like Jackson; hold up, I don't feel these niggas (nah)
Hey Wallace...

[Wale]
...Yep, what's the problem? I'm focused, I'm Kobe, I kill these niggas, hah
I ain't scared of these niggas, gettin' higher than Shaquille O'Neal's field goal percentage
Yeah me nigga; 'til the brokest nigga with got a mill plus interest; Meek keep livin', get 'em

[Meek Mill]
When I was dead broke used to always tell myself I'mma still be the shit
Till my P.O she locked me up, I'mma do the time come home and still be this rich
Still see the bricks, I'mma still be a Mitch, got these Rico niggas tryna kill me and shit
Hol' up, tryna kill me and shit; let me get the flow back, I was killin' this shit
We was killing them strips, drop heads -- +No Ceilings+ and shit
Ain't talking 'bout Wayne, bitch I'm talking them things, 300 in chains a million in whips, nigga~! Ho~!

[Chorus: Wale]
We ain't never posed to never have nothin' (have nothin') - that's right
Cause we ain't posed to never have shit (have shit) - nope, no
We ain't never posed to never have nothin'...
You see my focus ain't on them

[unknown singer]
No-ohhhh-whooooooa... {*7X*}

[Outro: Wale]
Started from the bottom, nigga, yeah
But now we grindin' 'til the law come get us, yeah
For the money and them commas, nigga, yeah
But can't forget about vagina, nigga, yeah
Started from that bottom, nigga, yeah
But now I got it it's a problem, nigga, yeah
For that money and them dollars, nigga, yeah
And I ain't rich but I'm still shinin', nigga (CHURCH)
I'm still shinin' nigga (CHURCH) I'm still shinin' nigga (CHURCH)
Shinin' nigga (CHURCH) we still shinin' nigga (PRAISE)
Shinin' nigga (PRAISE) we still shinin' nigga (PRAISE)
Shinin' nigga (PRAISE) let me shine my nigga (CHURCH)</pre>
