Song:   To Think I Used to Love You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You made me laugh some
You made me cry some too
You sent me off into a world of pain
And made me someone new
You made all kinds of promises
But only some came true
Now I know you need me more than I need you

[CHORUS]
To think I used to love you
For reasons I don't know
You polished up my halo
And I dirtied up your soul
I sure had a good time
But we both know I can't stay
To think I used to love you but I'm leaving anyway

You know I'm not perfect
And I tried to make you see
Somehow you though of everything
But you didn't think about me
Lies and disappointment
Makes your world go round
It's to late save me so you might as well come down

[REPEAT CHORUS]
