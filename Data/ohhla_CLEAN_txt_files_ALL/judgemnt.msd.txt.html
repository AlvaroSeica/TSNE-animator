Typed by: AZ Lyrics

How could you beat your woman till you see tears?
Got your children living in fear, mm
How you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
Selling debt to fiends
Barely fifteens
So you can ? all your dreams
How you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
You claim you're doing God's work
Greet the family with a smile
When all the while
You been raping that child
You a priest but you still can't
Wash the blood from your hands
The self hate they create in your hair
Got you pickin' up their weapons
And leaving your brothers there
How you gonna wash the blood from your hands?

I wonder what you gon' do
When he comes for you
Where you gon' run
Once he calls for you
Where you gonna hide
The day he sends for you
And he questions you
I wonder what you gonna say
When that day comes
When judgement day comes

I'm talking bout the sins you commit
Killing innocent kids so you can fill your pockets
Tell me how you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
Now take a look at these project buildings
They got us living in
It's like we're raised in prison cos of the colour of our skin
Now how you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
The pharmaceutical industry need to get paid
They're sitting on a cure
Watching new born babies die of AIDS
Tell me how you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
How could you keep exploiting 3rd world children
Using them as underpaid slaves
So you can make your millions
How you gonna wash the blood from your hands?

I wonder what you gon' do
When he comes for you
Where you gon' run
Once he calls for you
Where you gonna hide
The day he sends for you
And he questions you
I wonder what you gonna say
When that day comes
When judgement day comes

We sit and watch why people get hurt
Stand to say nothing when they do the devil's work
Walk straight by leave them crying in the dirt
What kind of people does that make me or you?
And we could have all the good intent
But we sitting in silence
We committing greed and violence
Then we got blood on our hands too

I wonder what you gon' do
When he comes for you
Where you gon' run
Once he calls for you
Where you gonna hide
The day he sends for you
And he questions you
I wonder what you gonna say
When that day comes
When judgement day comes

I wonder what you gon' do
When he comes for you
Where you gon' run
Once he calls for you
Where you gonna hide
The day he sends for you
And he questions you
I wonder what you gonna say
When that day comes
When judgement day comes</pre>
