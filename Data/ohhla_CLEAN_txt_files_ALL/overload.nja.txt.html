[Godilla]
The sky turn black no turning back
My words on tracks will burn you cats
Lion den bred you a Persian cat
Spit off the hook quicker than a purse get snatched
Verse worth a stack, nah homie I'm priceless
Leave you spineless and lifeless inside my ciphers
Hip-Hop got no feeling like robotic devices
Counter act that crisis writing that hype shit
Born lefty yet the god known to get righteous
Push come to shove then I'll kill a man like I'm Cypress
Rock cocaine flow many grams of that white shit
Play it cool and calm and any minute he might flip
Shine bright enough critics shutting they eyelids
Family business so ya know we keeping a tight knit
Constellations shift and the planet will burn
Live my raps promise I'm a man of my word
Put ya in the earth either that your fam's in a urn
Make classics still find time to stand on the curb
This man is absurd crazy like victor von doom
Liquid maneuvers, ninja spit a monsoon
Imagine anime compared to children cartoons
That's no ventilation while breathing car fumes
Kill ya self cock sucker forgetting your honor
Overload overpower all you smelled was gun powder

[Lone Ninja]
Bring carnage and terror your squadron's bombarded 
With pressure I'm harshest In forest and desert  		
The sergeant will sever Your head from your body
I spar with contenders beware of the volley	     	
You can never stop the violence I won the brawl
Shoot your helicopter pilot you plunge and fall		
I've come for war I'll slay at Armageddon
Thunder roars I'll maim and harm your brethren 
Spear, knife and axe fear my attack
On your dear life you're snared by the traps	
We're fighting back when it's time to retaliate
I'm climbing the alley's gate I find and decapitate		
The treacherous traitors they're slaughtered at will
It's death to invaders they're tortured and killed	 
Fought for the thrills remembered foes deceits
You're caught in the hills surrender, no retreat		
Lethal weapon, you seek to ease the tension
fleets is threatened, defeat you evil henchman	
So cold hearted I sunk your battle ship
No holds barred kid I punch with shadow fist	
You're struck with arrow tip and left for dead
You wept in dread I sever you beggars bled		
You're soft, nervous and known to fold
When toe to toe you short circuit and overload   </pre>
