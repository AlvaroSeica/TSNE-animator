[Chorus: T.I.]
Hey, ain't no use in tryin to lie
You know we be ridin fly
All that stuff you tryin to buy
Boy you know we be twice as fly
We do this, I'll show you how to do this
I promise we the coolest
I'll show you how to do this
I'll show you how to do this shit
 
[T.I.]
I got a drop fo'-thirty, rims so purty
Came to shut your local lotto down, closed curtains
You got a Murciélago I got a McClaren for it
The baller of the year, I oughta win a award
I got money off shores that I made off tour
Cash stashed in a paper bag from my whore
Some from the dro, some all blow
Never go broke but I still want mo'
Ya ain't gettin nuttin pimp if ya ain't gettin dough
You got a bitch and you wonder why she ain't gettin low
Cause she figured "What fo'?"
Shit if you was tryin to be fly, I suggest you try a little mo' nigga
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
 
[T.I.]
Who you ever seen under 30 this fly?
Penthouse, South Beach, top floor at the Satai
And this'll never stop, I'll be the shit until I die
Then after that consider me a ribbon in the sky
I'm G-4 flyin, big boat buyin
So I land in Miami then I sail to a island
My Cali crib high in the hills, I ain't lyin
Man them bitches get high on anythang they tryin
I got cars I don't know about, money I don't know about
Mil' for a movie, get a hundred K a show about
10 mil' in real estate, make a nigga really hate
What I care about it? I ain't like them niggaz anyway
 
[Chorus] w/ ad libs
 
[T.I.]
I'm through with the bitches, I talk they listen
Funny thang, all I gotta say is "Let's get it"
And my mouthpiece sweet, but my dick game vicious
For some pay but they already rich, they ain't trippin
She could tell I'm fly from times she ride with me
S-65 who ride to five-fifty
King worldwide, God of my city
Yeah them other niggaz say that they hard but not really
Pull up super clean, shut all the cars down
I got 50 G's on me, I'll tear the mall down
I used to be in the trill, I'm in the summer home now
One in Cabo, one in Miami, think I'll go to Rome now
 
[Chorus]  2X, w/ ad libs</pre>
