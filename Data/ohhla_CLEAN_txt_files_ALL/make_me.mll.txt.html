[Intro: Meek Mill]
I ain't never give a fuck
You think I'm supposed to give a fuck now cause I'm rich?
Shit on me made me worse
Hatin' ass niggas made me worse

[Meek Mill]
I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me (nooo)
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me (nooo)
It just make me (what it do?)
Yeah, it just make me (what it do?)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me (nooo)
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me (nooo)
It just make me (what it do?) wanna shit on y'all niggas (what it do?)
It just make me (what it do?) wanna shit on y'all bitches - straight up!

[Meek Mill]
And I done seen bitches change on me for a little pa-per (they did)
And I done seen niggas change on me for a little fa-vor (they did)
It just make me (what it do?) wanna stunt on y'all niggas (what else?)
It just make me (what it DO?) wanna fuck on y'all bitches - straight up!
And I be poppin' bottles in the club feelin' like Mee-cho (Big Meech)
And you know my niggas gonna bring them choppers everywhere we, go (that's me)
And I don't ever tuck my chain, I guess it's just a niggas e-go (NEVER!)
I'm just a young nigga ballin' wanna take me out the game -- D-Rose
And that make me, wanna load up the choppers go crazy
And doors slide on every niggas that hatin' me (hah!) and stunt on every single bitch that ever played me back then
You don't wanna hear the Mac-10 (BLRRRT~!) no one hear the stories what you had then (NAH)
Reason why I bought the Bentley and the Aston to shit on niggas every time a nigga back in (HO! HO! HO! HO! HO!)

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
And it made me (what it do?) wanna shit on ya'll niggas (what else?)
Cause lately (how ya feel?) I ain't been feelin' ya'll niggas (what else?)
Try and play me (what happened?) I drop a brick on y'all niggas (BLRRRT~!)
And make 'em go crazy (crazy) on every single one of y'all niggas - straight up!
And all these hoes wanna fuck with a nigga like, me (like me)
But when I was locked down ain't none of these hoes write, me (write me)
That's why I don't chase bitches cause the money only thing excite, me (it do!)
And I don't fuck with new niggas all day one niggas beside, me (day one)
We got thirties, ridin' round tryna do a nigga dirty (fuck!)
Try and burn me, headshot bye-bye for a birdie
And I ain't worried, about none of y'all niggas tryna hurt me
I got all these killers on stand-by and they kill any nigga tryna murk me - word up!

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
We don't never hate we ain't rattin' on nobo-dy (nooo)
When I touch twenty mil' I'ma go and get that Gat-ti' (whoooa)
It just make me (what it do?) wanna stack this paper (what else?)
It just make me (what it do?) wanna wack these haters straight up
And I be in the city goin' hard like a nigga own, that (that facts)
And you be fuckin' with the nigga that be fuckin' with the niggas code, rats (they rats)
I can't control my dogs with them 30's they don't never hold, back (BLRRRT~!)
Ask about me in my city they tell you that we really on, that
I got the baddest bitch (I do) I got the fliest whips (that right)
And God bless me I never ever gettin' tired of this (that right)
I ain't worried 'bout nothin' (nothin') I ain't worried 'bout nothin' (nothin')
Cause if I was worried bout somethin' all y'all niggas gettin' murdered bout' somethin' - straight up!
