Verse 1:

We spit rap and fire brown paper bag

Electric company money honey Gin Romie wrap

deuce flicks new and improved clicks Wu-kit
Blood on the barrel of a desert out in the desert

iller on some serial killer you wack duke shirt off

Verse 2:

Yo, Aiyyo, yo
Moseyin thousand dollar uniform you want
Celine Dion chickenheads yo straight out of Houston
Big ballers wall to wall brawlers die for us
Lie for us, snatch white man money cry for us
Creepin' through the halls on a keyboard
Friendly blessed dress and all Fendi

me blow for the station rep for one nation
Ghetto bust like revelation, analyse 
losin' two wives livin' two lives
Crew rise American Cream new guys
Two hundred pies get rich and plan sweet
Rappin' like mines you writing like mines they lines
Grab my dick stay in line we come to whip nines
Hold lot of carrying time and teaching crackers how
to shine, oh yeah one thing recognise fucking
wit the young keep 'em organised rest in peace
Donny my soul cries, What

Natural light up, light up, that's my word
This is this is for Clue right here dunn

Verse 3:

I'm third rail though half seal and I blow
Robert Deniro dough gundelero let the steel blow
Here me yo wild Trump style dunns connect 
three hundred ones while floating like a 
?macual chest bloaw? most craziest laziest
All I seeing blazes majorness mechanic wreckor
on a beige disc payin whether level bank rolls freakin'

pose dark skinned hoes crazy ill fly jersey exposed

Lex nose watching vet po posing wit the most fly
livest gortex made in Mexico, Brancs fifteen five
Celine Dion ties two thousand nine bubble eye shit
