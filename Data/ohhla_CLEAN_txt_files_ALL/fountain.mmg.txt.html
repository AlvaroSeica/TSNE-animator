[Rick Ross]
Ugh, fountain of youth
May our legacies live forever, ugh {Maybach Music}
All my niggaz quiet but we burnin loud
Makaveli to the max, never turn it down
Mac 11 in a Benz: how you like me now?
I run the city so my closet look like Nike Town
Niggaz talkin like bitches, is it my income?
Am I fuckin your bitches? Is it official?
My nigga did a dime, didn't learn a thing from it
Came home in two weeks got him a 600
Get a text from the boss, you know them bricks comin
Chicks at the beach house like they gon' miss somethin
From the churches I rose only lovin the dough
From the Chevy to Rolls, now it's fur on the flo'
Smoke an ounce of the truth, that's my fountain of youth
R.I.P. to Mr. Shakur, this one is for you
Nipsey Hussle and I got my nigga Stalley on it
Double MG burnin out in Cali on it

[Chorus 2X: Nipsey Hussle]
Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental, keys got me sentimental

[Stalley]
Look - these rap books buried in gold
The treasure of a million men, Versace shades trimmed in gold
My life's big, let them cameras explode
Capture this rags to riches story that I unfold
The youth fountain for the few countin
Made money, but who's countin?
It's hard stuntin livin in subsidized housin
Every bag you bring though the door, dude's countin
And every new girl you bring through, dude's houndin
They want your youth, so they watch your moves
From your pinky ring, down to how you lace your shoes
Rope chains with the precious jewels
The dope game had impression rules
So what they did with cocaine and a couple spoons
had the whole hood actin like goons
Tryin to be the richest, tryin to the be flyest
Claim to be ballin, end up like Len Bias
Screamin from the bottom of this fountain here
Nothin but silence! {M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}

[Chorus]

[Nipsey Hussle]
Uhh, laces in my blue Chucks, represent my bros first
Starin at my Roley bezel as I soul-search
Run this money marathon 'til my soles hurt
But no materials could measure what my soul's worth
I wanted everything, feel like I had no choice
Young niggaz wishin on a star like Rose Royce
Bein honest, killin mommas when we sold work
I made a promise, give me options and I cold turkey
Sick of sittin on the side while it's game point
Recurrin dream, tryin to scream but ain't had no voice
Crazy lady speak in tongues said it's gon' work
Never vocalize my visions, actions was my spokesperson
Study rich niggaz moves like my homework
Sacrilegious however streets was my own church
Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental, keys got me sentimental look

[Chorus] - 2X

[Nipsey Hussle]
Look
