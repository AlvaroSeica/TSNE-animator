[Intro]
What? All eyes. Pay attention.

[Deacon]
My familiarity makes you scared to see 
The beauty in front of your eyes
You're thinkin' merrily
Everything isn't a predictable occurrence
If you've experienced everything except a purpose
Then you've missed everything that was meant to be caught
Life sessions aren't lessons that can be simply taught
You gotta feel the matter
Build the data
You gotta strengthen self or your shield will shatter
In the field, we choose to scatter like lice
instead of coming together and keeping it tight
It's hard to be alone, deep in the night
I try to avoid the dark life and be seeking the light
But so many times I fall in between the lines 
Of what is a devilish sign and what is divine
If you base your life on wasted nights with no faith in sight
You might as well free base on pipes
I've fallen down but I got up friend
Fell twice
Three times
Got up again and again
And again, it's nobodies but my own it didn't end
You only don't win when you give in
The days we live in
Send shit that'll break the strongest
I put on my body armor and remain the calmest
Being peaceful at heart
Helps me see through the dark
? walk it's hard for evil people to start
Bullshit
Was a literally cool kid
Whose only form of battlin' is through music
If you hold yourself tight you can't lose it
Life or death 
It's up to you who you cruise with
Exercise knowledge to increase your wealth
If you know yourself you'll be shown your wealth (x3)

[Hook]

Sometimes I ask myself a question
Is my lack of inner reflection
some type of indication of what state my life is in?
They keep piping in elevator music
Sappy and happy as hell with foo foo shit
When I reflect back and recollect that
I was born into the state of walking slumber
Taught numbers, realize I'm dirt poor
It hurts more now that I'm older
Showered in water much colder than this
Holdin' my lips and close thee abyss
With the speech and the phoniest kiss
Rendered lifeless
Talk about an identity crisis
My third eye remains sightless
When the night hits
Can't help but lie awake
Contemplate fights with vice grips
Depressions and lessons in starvations
It's hard to be patient 
Sittin' perfectly still and listen to your own heart racin'
Assume the description of my life and it's reality
Is on the warm side of fatality
It's not fair the way you challenge me
Or the silent ways my talents be
Hidden inside these translations
Emancipations as I try to dab the slate clean
Futile attempts to make my fate clean
Hate seems all inclusive
It makes me want to fall reclusive
And rip the tallest loose-leaf
With a makeshift facelift
For my mental state
Huh check it out
