[Tech N9ne Spoken]
Te gon' make 'em slither dance to this one Zilla

[Verse 1]
Errybody jus' (throw your hands up what)
All the ladies jus (throw your legs up what)
All the fellas just (throw your cups up)
And toast to the homeboy that off in yo' girls guts, what?
Say man she said she broke up with you last week
Now you trippin' cause your chicken went out and passed cheeks
And got a fast leak, from Tecca Nina Katrina
Now she right up in mi cocino while your ass sleeps
How'd I take her from you? Oh, it twern't nuttin'
It's because your girly girly know I earn somethin'
Now I got them legs over my shoulders
Holdin' my soldier, swollen, I can't hold my composure
And when I come to town, your woman come around
And plenty fun is found when I give her some of the clown
The Kansas City style got her yellin "jus gimme now"
You don't wanna hear the sound cause I'm doin' bout 20 rounds

[Chorus x2]
If your girl's at a Tech show (it's what you thinkin')
Feel like she let go (it's what you thinkin')
You never get no (it's what you thinkin')
(it's what you thinkin')
(it's what you thinkin')

[Verse 2]
She know you barely make it, we got crazy cash
On the movie set, me and my homie Baby Bash
Got your girl waitin' to get her world shakin'
At the Grand American givin' your girl spankin's
Cause she's a bad gal, she said she need a release
So she greeted with beast now she's no longer sad now
I'm with your wifey
Cause she say I make her feel wanted and by the way she never met nobody like me
At the Graft'n and laugh makin' her stare at these
Cutty Cal Grese Chris havin' the paracleese
Got your hottie naughty when she drinkin' them Cara B's
At Kidd Rock's and I'm off in a booth with Tara Read
Tecca Nina is not a coward, I'll jump in the shower
And bumpity bumb that rock girl if you doubt us
Ask freaky Adina Howard about it
She know we Scorpios lovin' to hit it for hours

[Chorus x2]
If your girl's at a Tech show (it's what you thinkin')
Feel like she let go (it's what you thinkin)'
You never get no [x3] (it's what you thinkin')

[Verse 3]
I see you mad at me, but my nads happy
Cause you loosin' and now you wanna take a stab at me
She hangin' wit me cause you foul nigga
And I'm at the four seasons takin' her to eat Tao nigga
That's T.A.O when I see a hoe
She's hooked when I let the instant replay go
She's bare now everyone's there throwin' wood at it
Man this music's so unfair if you good at it
Come with us women its so fun with us under the sun with us
From dawn til' dusk im'ma give her the love that make her wanna say hummdawala
Praisin' this craziness in Vegas when I get up on the stage it's outrageous
Mandaly Bay with the right ages everybody gets laid to this
I apologize if your heart broken
Keep a spark smokin' once the Ninna starts scopin'
She'll lie to you and won't blink
When it come to Tecca Ninna bein' wit your lady don't think (don't think!)!

[Chorus X2]
If your girl's at a Tech show (it's what you thinkin')
Feel like she let go (it's what you thinkin')
You never get no [x3] (it's what you thinkin')

[Tech N9ne Spoken]
Ha ha it's what you though dawg your chicks wit us
Tech N9ne, Kalikeezy, Young Green why you keep doin' it to yourself dawg
Her jaws are full, get back, she'll holla tomorrow</pre>
