[Intro: 2Pac]
(Really, oh really)
Yeah! Mouse Man and the Wycked
What happens niggaz, Yo check this out
(What's going on?)
Imma need a verse form each of y'all then Imma do a verse
(So what really goes on)
(Really, oh really)
(So what really goes on)
Thats what the record company asks me What goes on, u know what I'm saying?
(What's going on)
i gotta let em know the mouse man ain't no joke yo tell me
(So what really goes on)
What - Goes - On

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Mama raised me crazy
Critics should of killed me as a baby
Cause now I'm twenty-one you can't fade me, yea (check it)
I'm getting major, pay check my pager
Poppin' more game than a Sega
Sharp as a razor, rollin' Cheroke and not a Blazer
Fuck the five-oh watch my lasers
Infared beam booming at your door cause it's on
One shot from the glock and he's gone
Tell me what goes on in the city
That's colder than a dope fiends titty
Testing one two, testing one two get a grip bitch
Come and get a whiff of this old slick shit
You think you moving but you dreaming
Nigga Oaktown, Oaktown's what they screaming? (Uh)
I'm doing flicks getting rich fuck the Grammys
Hand on my jammy word to granny
What goes oooooon

[Chorus]
Really, oh really
(So what really goes on)
What's going on?
(So what really goes on)
Really, oh really
(So what really goes on)
What's going on?
(So what really goes on)

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
I gonna ask y'all the question
What the point a nigga's steppin' to the front if your plan is on fessin
I guess that some niggaz don't know
Frontin' like a bitch I'll have your ass sized on a cut low
I know a pro who is stuck like Chuck in the middle of some shit
always over grip
Scratch to make a nigga kill his mama,
pimp his sons step to his boy with a gun and it's done
Need to think that I go be a goner
Victim of my oldschool oc from the corner
I remember the days she used to meet me by the school
playing flies up and now niggaz begging with a cup
So when I got paid I hit em off well
My oldschool G will lie for me or go to jail
So when it came time to show the true colors
he was ghost and I was lying in the gutter, yo
What's going On

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mouse Man]
The funk is on
all day and all night long
Popping cops till they drop sideways to the next spot,
got my uzi an extra clip
incase some punk bitch wanna rip, he can get some of this
I duck and dodge all night and we 50 niggaz deep in jeeps
smoking marujana, rather die than see the sun
Bust a left at the precinct lights down low peeling caps
so they know who's in control let me see em on their toes
rat a tat tat goes my tech 9
you can barely miss with this its splat time
I done pullede on 45th with some clips
and kick a niggas ass at the drop of a hat quick
shoot a cop and let them blow wish rodney had a 44
Smoking cops like indo letting them and their friends know
straight out of Oakland I make no joke when I'm smoking or
jacking until the break of dawn that's
what really goes on

[Chorus/Outro]

(Really, oh really)
Nigga, yea
(So what really goes on)
(What's going on?)
What goes on, what goes on
(So what really goes on)
(Really, oh really)
What goes on, what goes on
(So what really goes on)
(What's going on?)
What goes on, what goes on
(So what really goes on)
(Really, oh really)
What goes on, what goes on
(So what really goes on)
(What's going on?)
What goes on, what goes on
(So what really goes on)
(Really, oh really)
Tell me what goes on in the city that's colder than a dope fiends' tittay
(So what really goes on)
(What's going on?)
Tell me what goes on in the city that's colder than a dope fiends' tittay
(What Goes on brother)
(So what really goes on)
Tell me what goes on in the city that's colder than a dope fiends' tittay
(What really Goes on brother, can you tell me?)
Tell me what goes on in the city that's colder than a dope fiends' tittay
(What Goes on brother, can you tell me?)
Tell me what goes on in the city that's colder than a dope fiends' tittay
(What Goes on brother, can you tell me?)
Tell me what goes on in the city that's colder than a dope fiends' tittay
(What Goes on brother, can you tell me?)
Tell me what goes on in the city (What goes on brother, can you tell me?)
colder than a dope fiend's tittay (yeah)</pre>
