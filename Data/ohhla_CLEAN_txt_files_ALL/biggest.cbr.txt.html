[Chris Brown]
You would think we in a waterbed
All the sheets are soaked
I'm glad that I ain't gotta work today
Cause last night I did the most
Girl you would think I was inside your head
Cause I know everything you want
And no one asked you if you got a man
And do I care, I don't
That's when we started sexing
It's getting loud got them feeling like they in the clouds
Got them screaming like they in the crowd
I make them scream, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
When you scream I need
To pull your body closer, let me sex you baby
Girl you better not change your mind
Cause girl we got one night only
One just to love right baby
You're my biggest fan girl, I want you to holla

[Chris Brown]
Two girls, I'm watchin, no is not an option
Girl I'll be the captain, of the ship
They gonna have my motor rocking
Singing to them like Lionel Richie, all night long
Getting these bitches, and play in my song
And switching positions, I got the money so
I'm granting they wishes
I'll be their sugar daddy
It's getting loud got them feeling like they in the clouds
Got them screaming like they in the crowd
I make them scream, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]

[Chris Brown]
For me yeah - come on girl, tear it up
You can make it clap, for me girl, give it up
God damn, you're fine, I'm bout to stand up, stand up
I just came do you just to make you holler
Doing it for hours, even in the shower
Over and over again
Baby I'm all up in your garden, kissing flowers
Are you ready, I'm a take what's mine
You get comfortable, slow and easy
I'm kinda tipsy off this wine
So what I say might be a little confusing
I got a magnum in my wallet
I'm a pull it out I bet that I'll use it
I'm gonna make you scream

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
