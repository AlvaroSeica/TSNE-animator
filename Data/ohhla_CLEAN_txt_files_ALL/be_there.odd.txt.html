I know I'm hardly ever home
&amp; it's hard to ever get me on the phone
but you get me, I'll never leave you alone
you ain't with me but I got you
I'll spot you if your money's ever low
but kill all that pride shit cause brothers don't hide shit
different mothers never made us siblings divided
our father taught us lessons through the way he provided
when talking about bonds this as strong as the tie gets
what ever you choose in this life, I'm behind it
shout out to my brothers, not related by blood
some people think I made it, if it's true it's because
I had a team when shit got real, I doubted dreams
they'd remind me it ain't as hard as it seems
I just hope that I can pay
them all back for the advice that they gave
but will I ever match the price to be paid
I don't know
but I'll spend my whole life trying to make things right
if you need me, I'ma be within sight
Crazy to be an older brother
there's women but my sisters in the category other
I guess I got a fear of the shit that I did
being done to them by some nigga they love dear
I only hope that the lessons that I gave them as kids
stay with them in relationships &amp; they know the biz
cause y'all are young women now &amp; I see you as such
no need to worry cause the cloth that we're cut from's tough
y'all troopers in the moment of clutch, don't ever give up
but when things rough, you know I'm there
liver, heart or kidney know that you've got a spare
I hope to be your role model, a best friend &amp; brother
from the bottom of my heart, I love you
the world is yours but I'ma hold it till you're ready
&amp; hand it over to you when your situation's steady
just finish college, live a little, make some mistakes
the type you bounce back from, no permanent aches
&amp; i got you if it's ever more than you can take</pre>
