(S): Damn nigga
(R): Yo check this man, let me tell you about them dawg

[Verse 1: Retrospect]
Yo, I had this illmatic chick who would represent well
She had a New York state of mind and it wasn't hard to tell
She said guard your skill she was the most supportive
Until I caught her cheating with some nigga named Jordan
Life's a bitch and then you die that's why
I had to cut her off because I didn't half time
In the past I've been through different situations
Dominicans and Haitians, even Indians and Jamaicans
There was this common chick that just moved from California
But I thought she was a fiend 'cause she was always on the corner
She didn't know what love was or how to be faithful
She was mad I let her know, so I had to let her go
It was written on the note, but she didn't get the message
She didn't get to stepping, so I had to get the weapon
I told she could take it in writing or she could take it in blood
If you don't leave I'll put your face to the rug
Face it your done, when I found you was a crumb in the slums
I made you chowder, I gave you power
But I ain't sweating it son, 'cause that there is gone
Yo she was just a black girl lost, word up

[Dialogue: Retrospect &amp; Slow V]
(S) Yea, ha
(R) Yo man, I've had a lot of CD's on my deck
(S) I heard that nigga
(R) For real
But I know I ain't the only one with some crazy stories
(S) Nah man, I treat hoes like a radio nigga
Turn them on and blow a hole though them like a speaker of something
(R) Word
(S) Yea, yo but check it

[Verse 2: Slow V]
My first girl was big, and she was ready to die
She had suicidal thoughts, and was a friend of mine
Warning, the doctor gave her, one more chance
Juicy, it's unbelievable that things done changed
Me and my bitch were set we had mad Respect
Lived that Everyday Struggle but would always connect
She would call me big poppa right before I'd shoot
But I had to bounce when she said give me the loot
My second chick was fine she lived a Beautiful Struggle
She had black girl pain, so we would always cuddle
She saw me at the game, at the park, around my way
Going hard in that Ghetto Snow, I con a date
As time went by, I found out she never been in love, apart from me
Chick was really jock-ing me couldn't work it out
Chick was really stalking me with broken glass so I said back up off of me
My third chick was Tical she had a PLO Style
Once the Stimulation hit man I drove her wild
She was all I need with her round Biscuits fastened
Drove her something crazy when I had my thing in action
And there it is, yea

(R): Ha, and if that bitch ain't raw, if she ain't no classic
