Song:   Lonely Road
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus: Howie T]
Sometime I feel alone out here, on this road
Then I remember, where I been
But when it gets cold out there, it won't be long
I keep it pushing, and never look back again
I do everything monumental

[Master P]
Even in bad times, we never gave up
When we was outnumbered, none of it phased us
In the struggle we got strong, you real then you last long
When they said it was impossible, I had to prove them haters wrong
I never looked back, kept my eyes on my calling
I gave it my all, then I did what I wanted
Hard work it pays off, even when faced off
When back for the enemies, see life is to play ball
I tied up my shoes, and I got ready for war
I came from nothing to something, they couldn't take me apart
They say whatever don't kill ya, make you stronger and that's a fact
And through the pain real champs. never look back

[Howie T]
You get one shot, to make it
It's right there, for the taking
It's real life, no faking
And never look back

[Chorus]

[Master P]
It's a long road to success, especially when they hate you
Ain't nobody make you, so never let em break you
It's no limit to my dreams, and all the hard work I put in
And losing ain't a option, to all the struggling that I been in
I strived when I couldn't strive, kept running when I got tired
These scars and these wounds ain't make me quit, it made me realize
It's one thing that I want, and one thing I could get
If I keep going I'm gon' make it, ain't no option in me quitting
Cause winners never quit, quitters never win
If I fall I get back up, and do it all again
Use my gift and my talent, I gotta keep going
If you believe in your dream big, it's nothing when you want it

[Howie T]
You get one shot, to make it
It's right there, for the taking
It's real life, no faking
And never look back
