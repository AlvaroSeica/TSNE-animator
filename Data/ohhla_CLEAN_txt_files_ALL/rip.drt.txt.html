(Spoken by the Gangsta)
Hmmph!  A dedication to all them homeboys a
nd all them homegirls out there that done passed away
Dirty boys dedicate this rhyme to you 
that let you know how much love we got for you.
So from here on out let your soul have a peceful journey
One love!
 
(Pimp)
Now I got love for my homies who done shed blood for my homies
In the night sometimes I wish I coulda took slugs for my homies
But they gone now and you better believe I cried my tears 
Maybe the way y'all died it'll make me change the life I live
Like my homie Juwan Tobin raised in the village of guilt 
It's like the whole world stopped spinning my boy when you got killed
and Rico Maye...maaan why you had to depart
I remember riding our bikes around Cedar Park until it got dark
and found lil' shot up Jordan they found your body parked in the car 
I know you watching over your son from up above in the stars
an ole shocking Scott I know you where the angels stay 
cause with fluid on your lungs you died in the strangest way
You was my second cousin so I miss you every day
The beautifullest thing in this world  to see your smiiling face
and Fred and Isaac damn I hate y'all died like that
taking slugs in your back cause your truck got jacked
but lil' Isaac boy I wish you woulda had on a vest
and until this day I know your soul holdin' down the crest
and Peanut and Beesy both of y'all died for some girls
Yo' mama brought you here but haters took you out of this world
and Damon Frank from here on out we gonna hold your name down
The love you had for Hundred Station, Smiling Coat and Gumptown
and lil' Poony your soldier name was Eddie Hell
and all my thugs in Riverside gave you the truest fairwell
and that's for real!
 
[Chorus(both)]
Now some people come and some people go
But how you leave this world young playa don't nobody know
I see your chest up out the casket not on the floor
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to go
Now everytime I hit that wood I blow smoke in the sky
I know you closer to cloud 9 my boy so go on and get high
I see your mama shaking her head and wiping her tears from her eyes
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to die
 
(Gangsta)
It's been a struggle everyday just trying to fight to survive
It's like the Gump ain't been the same since my homies done died
Now Torio that was my boy since elementary days
I blow smoke for you in the air every time I get blazed
When Meatball took that fall I just couldn't even cope
The last time I seen my boy was down in juvenile court
I tell my players hold your head and keep your glock by your side
Don't be scared to up and bust when they testin' your pride
Juwan Turner got killed man I can't take it no more
I might be wrong but I don't think it was my homie time to go
When lil' Junior died the Westside got out of control
We miss that brother soul how much he'll never know
Oh and reminiscing on my boy lil' Khatto 
I know you in that paradise cause that's where all the g's go
Pour out some liquor for my homies no I'm spitting these rhymes
Cause pouring out some alcohol can't tell you how I feel inside
The days that we spent without your presence around
For all them players who didn't make it we gonna hold this thing down
Until we meet again homies cause it ain't gonna be here
I guess I'll see y'all in the heavens where all the real g's live
and that's for real
 
(Chorus)
Now some people come and some people go
But how you leave this world young playa don't nobody know
I see your chest up out the casket not on the floor
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to go
Now every time I hit that wood I blow smoke in the sky
I know you closer to cloud 9 my boy so go on and get high
I see your mama shaking her head and wiping her tears from her eyes
I'm asking the Lord the same ole questions why you had to die
 
(Pimp)
Now as I walk through the valley with the shadows of death
My homies gone so I'm walkin this valley all by myself
We miss our boy lil' Willie so much he was like a brother to us
I know you watching the world telling God how tight we was
You might be gone but you ain't dead I feel your soul by my side
Asking me to check on your grandma to make sure she's alright 
I know it ain't nothing I can say right now that can bring your life back
I don't even hate the boy who killed you I'm gonna let God handle that
Cause who am I.....
to judge a man for his sin and his faith
the only thing I can do for Willie right now is change my ways
It's gonna be hard cause I'm a young playa that loves to get paid
Until that day I'm gonna pimp whores until I go to my grave
 
(Gangsta)
Now as I sit and reminisce upon my boy and all the things we been through 
Who knew this early in our lifetime that the Lord would choose you
How can I make this pain I can't take itit's breaking me down inside 
I'm asking the Lord to bless your soul as I wipe the tears from my eyes
I find it hard continuing life without you walking this earth
I guess we all gonna have to face death as an answer for birth
But where you're resting now you're free from all these criminal minds
I can't lie I'm kinda glad you're free from these struggling times
But yet and still I don't understand why you had to go so soon
My deepest sympathy goes to your family for your loss was a harsh wound
So Rest In Peace lil Willie Dickerson another homie to mourn
But I can't wait until Judgement Day when all our souls can rejoin
 
(Chorus)
Now some people come and some people go
But how you leave this world young playa don't nobody know
I see your chest up out the casket not on the floor
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to go
Now every time I hit that wood I blow smoke in the sky 
I know you closer to cloud 9 my boy so go on and get high
I see your mama shaking her head and wiping her tears from her eyes
I'm asking the Lord the same ole questions why you had to die
 
(Spoken by the Pimp)
...and that's that Dirty Love we got for all them lost souls that done passed away 
in the Gump and we also dedicate this album to our close homeboy 
Willie Dickerson
Rest in Peace my boy</pre>
