[Verse I]
Dear Slim, I never wrote you or been calling
My name ain't Stan son nah we've never met and
My name's KJ let me begin by introducing now
Myself to you and these very reasons I'll be writing
Why I took my time the who what where and why and
The purpose of my verse and the reasons I'm reciting
What I hope your learning from the truth I pray your finding
And every word I'm writing down upon the dotted lines and
See I heard ya first album it was called infinite
I shook my head cause nowadays you sounding different
What drove ya to take your whole persona and be flipping it
Now what makes a man totally change see I ain't getting it
See was you sick of getting booed when you was ripping it
And sick of never having dough and you wanted to put an end to it
What good's all kinds of dough, plus all kinds of flow?
To gain a world of fans but suffer the loss of soul

[Chorus - 4X]
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la (to whom it may concern)

[Verse II]
Dear Slim I never wrote you or been calling
This is my 2nd letter cause see son I gots a real problem
It's that to you that I'm always catching these comparisons
And after shows I got these people coming up to me saying
You sound like Slim Shady son you sound like Eminem
And I be like now really man do I gots to go through this again
See I used to get mad and sick of people saying that
Till at this one show this one day I met this one cat
He told me how he used to listen to you but now listens to me
Had your LP but threw it out and bought my CD
I'm like "For real?" he's like "Yeah," said my music made a difference
It got him away from all your words and images
Gotta mention this now what about the effects you have on kids?
You ever stop to think about the millions you influence
Or is it just irrelevant is it a true life you telling it
Or just a way for some record companies selling it
The only thing we's got in common is our melanin
Or a lack of it but anyway now this is what I'm saying
Its for you that I'm on my knees now daily praying
Praying that God opens your eyes now to what I'm relaying
Now I'm praying that it's your heart that will soon be changing
Praying one day that you'll be calling upon his name and
But anyway I'm signing off now don't keep me waiting
This is KJ another cat just trying to make it

[Chorus]

[Verse III]
Dear Slim I heard about the stuff you's going through
See I could relate to you cause son I'm about as old as you
See we both know what it's like just to be growing up to be in a neighborhood
When you's the one and only kid that's white
Or to get booed when you on the mic just because your skin is light
It ain't right but sometimes you know that's life
But really tell me what you do?
You just push on with hopes on that someday you'll put on your crew
I hope you understand that I ain't even dissing you
And even though it's a song you'll probably never listen to
See what I send to you is this
Is that a life without Christ is just a life that is never fixed
I hope you remember this now a few sentences
About a living God who loves you and plus forgives
And I'll be praying for your ex-wife and plus your kid
It's hard to live in a world as crazy as this one is
And even though now it really might sound redundant
God's got mad love for you up in a mad abundance
You'll sell a couple mill I'll probably sell a couple hundred
There's more to life than selling records and just getting blunted
But anyway that's really all I gots to say
Just another word from an emcee now around the way
Maybe some day we meet each other in some way
Till then one love one God one way

[Chorus] </pre>
