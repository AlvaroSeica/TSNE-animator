[Hook]
Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom power and love
Our God is an awesome God

Them devils tryin' to kill me (I gotsta shake 'em)
Them devils tryin' to kill me (God's gon' take 'em)
Them Devils tryin' to kill me (I gotsta shake em)
Throw it up if you feel me (God's gon' take em')

[Pastor Troy - Verse 1]
Our Father, which art in Heaven
Give me direction while bustin' my weapon
And all these wanna-bes is the G's that I stack
Makin' money milk a hunnie homie I ain't lookin' back
In the back on them bowls on the road gettin blowed with the gold kit
You rappin' that thug shit
You gon' get your wig split
You gon' get your head bust
Whatever the method, just as long as his mouth hush
Now I'm seein' devils, they tryin' to kill me
But I'm totin' metal, uh huh you feel me
Believin' in God against all odds
Angels helpin me take him Devils I gotsta shake 'em

[Hook}

[Pastor Troy - Verse 2]
Hallowed be thy name, I came off in this game
To make your system bang, off in them Chevy things
Four 15's, Two Alpines
And the color change, as the sun shines
That's why they hate me though
The pedal through the floor
Reppin' the Southside, Southside ho
You hear them FlowMasters
You know that it's the Pastor
Wilin' down the street, beatin' up out my seat
Them devils watchin' me, so I ain't goin' home
I ain't NEVER scared, you better tell 'em Bone
I be in every zone
Chrome, cocked, bad, ass, on, block
On lock is the whole state
You know we swervin' through, you see them license plate
I'm reppin' GA, they wanna kill me
'Cause I got too many gangstas that feel me
