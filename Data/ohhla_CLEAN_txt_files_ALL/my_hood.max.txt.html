[Max Minelli talking]
Fa show doe
Say Hap, I wanna let 'em get a feel of my hood, though
Know what I'm talkin' bout?
Let's do dat..

[Background Voice-Sped up sample; sounds like a small child/woman.]
Ooh la la la
Baby I'm so high
I feel like I'm in Paradise
Your lovin' caught me by surprise
You make me say oooh...
aaah..
I just wanna be with you
Be With just and only you
You make me say (Now, now make it Bounce, bounce)
[continues throughout song]

[Max Minelli talking]
Yeah. Bounce, bounce. In my hood
Yeah. Bounce, bounce. In my hood
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We be fuckin' the game up when we do it like this
I love the niggaz in my hood
Yeah, yeah. Know Wha'I'm talkin' bout?
Wan' take a walk though the hood with me?
Come on

[Verse One]
Come take a walk on the wild side, the nigga, foul side
They done shot up the corner, now none the children can go outside
That's how they actin'
Now holla when you bout some jackin'
Boys spillin' them guts and they tryin' to wipe it up with napkins
Back in the game it wasn't quite this tragic
Capture the magic, smokin' on somethin' up in traffic
I'm a step away from bein' psychopathic, tryin' to fall back
Beepin' the weedman, but he ain't never call back
I'm a lifetimer liftin' weights away from being cock strong
But don't let that get ya wrong, I know how to cock comb
I can make beef with ya, or make bread with ya
Duck a fed with ya
Say it with ya
Bust a head with ya
On the same block pops got the blues on
I'm a lil' homie done went to jail, but my shoes on
But I been hustlin' since I had Underoos on
Reppin' for my hood
I'm a fool 'till the tombstone, tombstone
In my hood

[Chorus part 1: 2x]
Yeah, Yeah. In my hood
I love the thugs in my hood
I love the broads in my hood
I got much love for my hood

[Chorus part 2]
Yeah, Yeah. In my hood
Hah? Yeah. In my hood
In my hood
I got much love for my hood
Yeah, Yeah. In my hood
Uh, uh. In my hood
In my hood
I got much love for my hood

[Verse Two]
Say lil' man, let me tell ya what it feel like
What bein' real like
What grippin' wood wheel like
And packin' steel like
Then what duckin' the cops like
What bleedin' blocks like
What ridin' on chops like
And bein' out the box like
At the stoplight, not a worry in the world
Though we all grown up, we still boys and girls
I still hold my own
I'm well known, on a blow up phone
Makin' a deal with the Pope, tryin' to sew up Rome
I had to grow up wrong, but it's safe to say
I stayed focused and I came up in a major way
Pay attention to what you do and all the thangs you say
I ain't trippin', I'm just makin' sure everythangs okay
Countin' days
Think I'm a dog in a two-man cage
I'm on a whole nother page
Gettin' smarter with age
If you want to retaliate, let me be part of the rage
We went from watchin' cartoons to countin' war wounds
In my hood

[Chorus p1 2x]

[Chorus p2 1x]

[Verse Three]
Nowadays
Everybody wanna be hard and say they real with that
But catch a case and they don't know how to deal with that
Whatever happened to takin' your lick and takin' your trip
Scorin' all your work soft, then makin' it flip
Now niggaz tellin' on they homeboys, thinkin' they sick
You say you real nigga, be it, stop fakin' this shit
I got G, for niggaz growin' up on me
Smokin' too much weed then throwin' up in the street
A million and one ways to use thug in a sentence
Talkin' on the blow up phone with five thousand minutes
And it's, nothin' sick about hustlin' hard
And a nigga can't even pay you what you're chargin'
And who would I be, to rap about money, jewelry, and cars
And it be grown women ill and children out here starvin'
Still lookin' up to God and I'm hopin' he pardon
My ways, because I gotta get it on like Marvin
In my hood

[Chorus p1 2x]

[Chorus p2 1x]

[Just the voice 4x]
Ooh la la la
Baby I'm so high
I feel like I'm in Paradise
Your lovin' caught me by surprise
You make me say oooh...
aaah...
I just wanna be with you
With just you and only you
You make me say</pre>
