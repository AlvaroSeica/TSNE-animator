[Son of Bazerk]
I spits the rhyme it's a race against time
Take this make it funky I'ma blow your mind
From the F.D.R. drive to the Southern state
To blow up New York and watch the water inflate
From the East end
To the West end ya put me in a coffin
Then bury me deep
I'm Son of Bazerk I'm comin' with the bomb, shell shock
Vietnam
Comin' with mad fat stacks of raps
I got my shit down pat and in fact
Yeah son, uh
I'ma hit 'em high, black in their eye
I'm the lyrical blend that I sit on

[Flavor Flav, Son of Bazerk]
Get on down, git git on down
Ya got to just get down
Get on down, git git on down
Get on down, just get on down
Get get get on down
Get on down, and just get on down
Get get get on down
Kick it Flav

[Flavor Flav]

We ain't gonna stop till the beat is done
Everybody come and get out ya seat
And move ya feet, Flav two kay bee

Work work ya feet, hurt hurt your feet
