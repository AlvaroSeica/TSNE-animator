I'm chilling at the crib, kicking back and feeling lazy
My girl was in the living room, my phone was ringing crazy
It rang a couple of mo' times, the animosity grew
(why don't you go answer your phone), girl I ain't tripping I'm with you
(hell naw what you got to hide), what girl I'm grown
I ain't hiding nothing, damn I shoulda unplugged that phone
As I head towards the room, I get a uncomfortable notion
I know that this a female, I'm moving in slow motion
Man I hope this Greek or Murder One, cause drama I don't want it
I got a 1932 phone, with no caller I.D. on it
Ain't no sneaking to unplug it, she gon go off if she find me
When I walked over to answer it, she just stood there right behind me
Hello (hey baby), ay ay ay what's up homie
(I was hoping I could see you, I was feeling kinda lonely)
That's what's up dog, (dog why you talking to me like that)
Ah it ain't nothing, ay I tell you what man I'm-I'ma call you right back

[Hook - 2x]
I'm so tired of lying, and chasing temptation
Creating fabrications, just to fix a situation
I tell one lie, and keep a standby partna I could call up
A second lie to cover the first one up, and a third to clean em all up

Now when I hung up, my girl gave me a real funny look
She didn't notice that I put the phone, halfway back on the hook
I asked her for a glass of juice, thinking that was a close call
When she walked into the kitchen, I snatched the cord out of the wall
She came back with the juice, we just layed across the bed
She was quiet, but I could sense she had suspicions in her head
I cleaned it up, did what I had to do to suit her
I knocked her down she fell asleep, I jumped on the computer
It's one o'clock A.M., I'm tired about to turn it in bro
I see some bright car lights shine, through my living room window
What the hell I peeped outside, I'm bout to get chopped up
The girl who called me earlier, done messed around and popped up
Befo' she knock I slip outside, to keep from getting busted
I gotta maker her move around, ain't no time to discuss it
She asking why she can't come in, how come I'm blocking the do' off
I could see it in her face, she getting loud and ready to go off
It's bad enough she popped up, and I really wanna check her
Told her my grandma was her from out of town, and I ain't wanna disrespect her
My girl woke up and came outside, when she heard the voices echo
Next thang you know I'm in my drawas, cussing out Joey Grecko

I'm face to face with two women, I been smashing and kissing
There's a logical explanation for all of this, if y'all would listen
One was ready to fight, the other was ready to start capping
But in a unexpected twist, something very strange happened
They started talking, the plex turned off
The one that popped up, went to her car hopped in and burnt off
My girl went back to bed, like everything was alright
But I ain't go to sleep for one second, I stayed up all night
I'm knowing, they got something up they sleeve
Next morning when she woke up, I couldn't wait for her to leave
I acted like I had somewhere to go, and drove off separate
Then followed her to IHOP, where she met ol' girl for breakfast
I wished that I could hear what they was saying, but I wasn't able
Next thing you know two dudes came in, and sat down at the table
I know both of these fools, now they plan done been uncovered
They done cut me loose, and introduced they brothers to eachother
That's cool yeah they got me, I was wrong and I can't condone that
I got mo' lil' mamas I could call, but hold up man where my phone at
She has switched my phone with hers, knowing I would try to watch her
Looked right at me held my phone up, sent a text message saying "got ya"
