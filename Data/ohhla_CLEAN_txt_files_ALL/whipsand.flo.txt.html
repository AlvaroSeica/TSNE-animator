Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Strange fruit I roll up in my Ford Taurus
Emissions I wont pass like Gandalf at Moria
Way out of order
Sedan with four doors
Pull out garage and lost side view mirror
My credit card final fantasy breaks the limit
I just paid just brakes to break my lemon
Wont make enough juice for my pessimism
So I'm not for given 'till my debts forgiven
Skim off the top
Convertible roofs
Thinking spanish

Green sounds like the truth
Got it on lock jaw to the tip o' the tooth
Way I floss no dental insurance to boot
But my chain hangs low, I could double dutch
Keep my eyes to the floor so don't stumble much
I shine at night from all the carrots
'Cause it's not who you are but who you're wearing
Stay sportin lashes from the old massa's
Clasps on the neck says
'Property of the masses'
And whats under the chassis
The block is gentrified while the governor's classic
Don't know who the boss is do I hold the power
Or am I powered like horses
Whip is blowin' out my back like I'm exhaust-ed
Pipes blowin' more fire than pentecost

Who killed o?
Why and what's the reason for?
Who starts homicidal wars?
Rich man poor man either or?
Who shows us what we knead?
Who's got the bread for the luxuries?
Who told us it's ingrained?
We who hold these whips and chains

If there's no lock who needs a key?
When did we stop being free?

I see things vis a vis a sea change
Full fathom five people became remains deep beneath chains
We pay into easing these pains
'Cause the history is difficult
Wish the results could be flipped like reciprocals
Allow me to renumerate aloud the typical rude awakenings of the drowsy consumer base
Bass boom will make the crowd sing and syncopate with the views that they're espousing
Synchronize to the stupid take a thousand
Sinning like every excuse they make is valid
Simon Williams I Wonder Man
Just how did our oil get under their sand?
And how did our homes get onto their land?
And how did our foes get guns in their hands?
Conflict diamonds
Child labor tennis shoes
Genocide energy
Gentrified gin and juice
Slave trade banks
Rape-based internet movies
What's a simple straight-laced human to do
With a strange fate twist and fame
Except talk shit and name off a list of gains
But do you realize I'd find my lips in flames
If I tried to take pride in these whips and chains

Who holds these
Who holds these
Who holds these traps and circuses
We want it
They own it
So we're going half-berserk for it
Let's take it
Let's take it
Let's take it back before cassettes
Pepsi cans and packs of percocet
1910 all the factory workers said
Yes we can demand a weekend
If we can get the man to weaken
So if you're ready than send a beacon
To be continued and to begin
We can't be content to steep in the anaesthesia
Invisible hands of phantoms depend on
Ya fantasies have been poisoned
But we've got the panacea!</pre>
