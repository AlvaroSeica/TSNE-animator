Song:   Hold On to the One
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Why you gotta tell me like I ain't no good for you?
Why you gotta tell me like its somethin I should do?
Never really know, but time will tell
Woke up in heaven, now I'm livin' in hell

So, hold on to the one, who will make you fell numb
Hold on to the one, cause its better than some
Hold on to the one, who will make you fell numb
Hold on to the one, cause its better than some

Since the first time that I looked into your eyes
It was a feelin, kept me wonderin inside
Feelings of lost, or maybe even confused
So much for lovin, that I'm willin to lose

So, hold on to the one, who will make you fell numb

Hold on to the one, cause its better than some
Hold on to the one, who will make you fell numb
Hold on to the one, cause its better than some

A little bit soft, a little bit smooth, a little bit longer now
A little bit fast, a little bit hard, till we get stronger now
I wanna to rock with me, baby
Come on and roll with my sweet darlin
I wanna to rock with me, baby
Come on and roll with my sweet darlin

So, hold on to the one, who will make you fell numb
Hold on to the one, cause its better than some
Hold on to the one, who will make you fell numb
Hold on to the one, cause its better than some</pre>
