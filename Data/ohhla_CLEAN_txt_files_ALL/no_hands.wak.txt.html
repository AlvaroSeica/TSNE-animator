[Intro]
Listen to the track BITCH!

[Chorus]
Girl the way you movin, got me in a trance
DJ turn me up - ladies this yo' jam
I'ma sip Moscato, and you gon' lose them pants
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands
Girrrrl, drop it to the flo'
I love the way your booty goooooo
All I want to do, is sit back and watch you move
And I'll proceed to throw this cash

(Waka, Waka, Waka, Waka, Flocka, what? Yeah)

[Waka Flocka Flame]
All that ass, in yo' jeans
Can Wale be? Can Roscoe scheme?
Long hair she don't care
When she walk she get stares
Brown skin or a yellowbone
DJ this my favorite song
So I'ma make it thunderstorm
Bud want it Flocka yeah
Blow it fuck it I don't care
Tits is flyin everywhere
Got my partner Roscoe like bruh
I'm drinkin - hell, can't you tell?
Every sip {?} fifteen steps so fuck it
Well I'm tryin hit the hotel with two girls that swallow me
Take this dick while I swallow {?} Moscato got her freaky
Hey you got me in a trance, please take off yo' pants
Pussy pop on her handstand, you got me sweatin
Please pass me a fan - damn!

[Chorus]

(Ay, ay, Wale, uh)
(She said look ma, no hands)

[Wale]
She said look ma, no hands; and no darlin I don't dance
And I'm with Roscoe I'm with Waka I think I deserve a chance
I'm a bad muh'fucker, go and ask some motherfuckers
A young handsome motherfucker I sling that wood I just nunchuck 'em
And who you with? And what's yo' name?
Did you not hear boo? I'm Wale
And that DC shit I rep all day
And my eyes red cause of all that haze
Don't blow my high, let me shine
Drumma on the beat let me take my time
Nigga want beef we can take it outside
Fight for what broad? These hoes ain't mine
Is you out yo' mind? You out yo' league
I sweat no bitches just sweat out weaves
Wear our tracks let me do my thing
I got sixteen for this Roscoe thing
But I'm almost done let me get back to it
Whole lot of loud and a little backwood
Whole lot of money big tip I would
I put her on the train little engine could, bitch!

[Chorus]

[Roscoe Dash]
Roscoe Dash, okay!
R-O-S-C-O-E, Mr. Shawty-Put-It-On-Me (please)
I be goin ham, shawty upgrade from bologna (please)
Them niggaz tippin good girl but I can make it flush (I can)
Cause I walk around with pockets that are bigger than my bus (whoa~!)
Rain, rain go away, that's what all my haters say
My pockets stuck on overload, my rain never evaporates
No need to elaborate, most of these ducks exaggerate
But I'ma get money nigga, e'ryday stuntin nigga
Ducks might get a chance after me
Bitch I'm ballin like I'm comin off of free throws
Is the head of the game, no cheat codes
Lambo' Roscoe no street code
And your booty got me lost like Nemo
Go, go, go, ga-go on and do yo' dance (right now)
And I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands
(I'm gone)

[Chorus]</pre>
