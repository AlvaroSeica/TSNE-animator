[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
I'm a hit with you a right, left, right, left, you're toothless
Akrobatik's ruthless, longevity proves this, Boston, Massachusetts
Representative, that was sent to give 
All you sensitive, rap critics (uh) or eat a fat di-dick (what?)
And a side of sack with it
Cause your playlist need more Ak in it
Fat beats and lyrics, A to the K's packin it
Passionate, that's how I stay accurate
Mastered this, flow that be enticin many bachelorettes
Got the brothers wildin in the crowd like they had Tourette's
Mad cassettes contain my freestyles from back in '95 (woo)
Check the archives, I bet you find me live (uh, uh)
From way back, dope since "Real Da Real" and "Adat"
Born the same day as that cat that wrote "The Big Payback"
So all my nigs lay back and just bang this (uh), wrath of my anguish
So nice that I should own the fuckin language
Rap is goin through some whack changes, yo

[Chorus - Akrobatik]
But I don't know what all of that's about
And all of that's about to change once Ak come out
And yo, them whack CD's you passin out
They 'bout to be worth jack once Ak come out
Yeah, nobody got shit to rap about
But all of that's about to change once Ak come out
Yo, and I know what y'all are askin 'bout
Where's that "Absolute Value" from Ak? (Ak, hey, yo)

[Verse 2 - Akrobatik]
I'm 'bout to blow up the scene (uh) (*sound of an explosion*)
With shit sick enough to make you throw up your greens (greens)
Call Ak the "Big Dig," he tore up The Bean (Bean)
With that downtown Boogie Brown, "you know what I mean?" (uh)
Fuck your dreams, I'm takin out the supreme member of this new rap dream team (team)
That heat it up like kerosene ('sene), skills previously never seen (seen)
Lungs evergreen (green), eight year career still buildin hella steam (haha)
This the groove that made Stella dream (dream)
Decapitatin the whack like helicopter propellers, SEEN (seen)
but not heard, it's not my style, fuck a image
I'd rather have a dope LP from start to finish (true dat)
And many MC's ain't reachin for their darker limits (uh)
Got the accessories but all the other parts diminished
And some of them still be pushin up monster digits (right)
Lowest common deminator, cats want that shit-it (AH)
But yo

[Chorus - Akrobatik]
I don't know what all of that's about
But all of that's about to change once Ak come out
Yo, them whack CD's you passin out
They 'bout to be worth jack once Ak come out
Yeah, nobody got shit to rap about
But all of that's about to change once Ak come out
Yeah (uh), I know what y'all are askin 'bout
Where's that brand new hot shit from Ak? (yeah)

[Outro - Akrobatik - talking]
(Uh), let it bump, yeah
J-Zizzle
