Hey you know what homey
I'm sick and tired of these fools homey, yea
Talking about how they're keeping it real, you know
Well then keep it real ese, you know
Fuck all that bullshit your talking about homeboy
No one wants to hear that shit
Keep it real homeboy

I walk up on the scene with my white sneakers
My big ass Levis, my big ass t-shirt and look around to see who I see
The same fucking people who can't see me
You can close your eyes, it's getting kind of rough
You can open your eyes, ese not wide enough
To even catch a sneek peek or Peek A Boo of what the Lil' Rob is all about 
When I leave they all follow out
Lil' Rob be the one of a kind
With the one of a kind mind, most of the time I can't find mine
You ask me how I'm doing and I still say that I'm fine
Walking on that fine line, no time on my time line
Who left the door open? Your time just ran out
As for patience, well mine just ran out
And I got nothing left to do but to sit back patiently
To make sure you continue hating me

[Chorus x2]
Lil' Rob, forever live my name
Lil' Rob, forever live my name
Lil' Rob, forever live my name
You wanna be like me but it's just not the same

Hey holmes, I heard a lot about you ey
Well was it good shit or bad shit?
I bet you twenty bones it was some bad shit
But that doesn't even matter though
Cuz any publicity is good publicity, that's why they mention me
I must be doing something right
But they ain't doing nothing right, I'm making sure that I'm busting tight
Now everybody wanna be
Hey holmes you heard Lil' Rob's new jam? He's talking shit about me
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't flatter yourself
Later on you're gonna look back at yourself, and be all mad at yourself
For acting like a little girl, chavala
Roll the fuck up, you try too much, you need to slow the fuck up
Hold the fuck up, shut the fuck up
Silence is golden like the Daytons that I'm rolling around the town that I'm patrolling
The town I live in is lonely, it's lonely but I still won't cry
It's just me, myself, and I

[Chorus x2]

Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again, I remember whistling 
If I could go back in time and do things different 
I probably wouldn't do anything different
I learned a lot, seen a lot, that's why these streets mean a lot
I got shot down the block at the stop
Trust you? Fuck you
I've know people for seven years that I don't trust, and you think I'm gonna trust you
I gotta do what I must do, with or without you
There's something about Lil' Rob, but there's nothing about you
Can't keep a good man down ese, but you keep on trying
Take to the sky on my natural high, cuz I'ma keep on flying
Here's a little something for your brain to cause the pain
When I'm done then my son will forever live my name
Lil' Rob, and when he's done then my son will forever live my name
And when he's done then my son will forever live my name
And when he's done then my son will forever live my name</pre>
