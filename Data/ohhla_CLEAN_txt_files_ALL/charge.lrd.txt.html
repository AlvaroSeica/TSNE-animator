[Intro]
See, in the beginning I gave love
And I got lies 
I gave brotherhood
And I got betrayal 
So now here in the end I will give darkness!
And I will get the vengeance needed to free my heart!
C'mon!
 
[Verse 1]
Now I bring it dead wrong, cause somehow it's righteous to kill 
I cry tears with god, visit Christ on the hill 
Devour six squads and show I'm nice with the skills 
Powerful pit jaws put your life on the chill 
I don't party ya'll, I just MC-body ya'll 
Crowd streets like Mardi Gras, you probably saw 
Now Lord Have its car crashes, orgasms 
Broad caskett, raw rappin, all action 
[We don't play around Fuck that lay ya down]
Don't insult me Fuck rapping' for fame 
I'll rap till these niggas is gauze wrapping' your brain 
All actual pain fall back in your lane 
Call pastors on gains, enjoy blasting' the range 
Hardcore fractured your face, I'm back on the case 
Have your jaw line tapping' your waste, Â“the fuck out my face"!
 
[Chorus]
Stand up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Hands up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Man up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
People, got what you want 
 
Stand up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Hands up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Man up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
People, got what you want 
 
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I walk through the shadow of death I'm going' fear no evil 
you don't know me Nigga I fear no evil 
Priceless rhyme sliced your spine you're all see-through 
Life of crime, life divine they all evil 
It's a cold world, stray shots hit your Mrs 
from west coast niggas that rock socks with slippers 
Or east coast niggas with scuffed up chuka-tims
on some motherfuck-a-you, fuck-a-her, fuck-a-him!
[Back up, we getting' strong Act up, let's get it on]
YES-hold my Sword &amp; Shield properly Rust these blades
trust these ways, cut sloppy weed 
Must be payed, fuck these games No lottery's 
Fuck these dames, suck these brains, and give lobotomies 
My music whispers futuristic space odyssey's 
Do 'em how they gotta be, represent properly 
 
[Chorus]
Stand up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Hands up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Man up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
People, got what you want 
 
Stand up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Hands up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Man up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
People, got what you want 
 
[Verse 3]
There is no mercy, so let my death certificate blaze 
if we face off I'll rip your face off like Nicolas Cage 
Got a heavy heart, and ridiculous rage 
I was [?] from the start, you a trick in these days 
Keep it barbaric, the god had it with all'a ya'll 
Bump heads with niggas, now they falling' off 
Concentrations send your camps to holocaust 
Bloody, now haul 'em off too cruddy, and can't call 'em off cause   
[We aint backing down We just back 'em down]
Six feet deeper, I dig a ditch with the reaper 
Drill a clip, put they feet up 
Street sweeper made 'em see us 
 
[Chorus]
Stand up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Hands up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Man up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
People, got what you want 
 
Stand up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Hands up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
Man up [Charge], let's get it on [Charge]
People, got what you want 
 
[Outro]
Yeah 
Sword &amp; Shield It's all to the real
It's all for the thrill It's all for the kill 
Lord Have 
Ice Pirate
Yeah, c'mon </pre>
