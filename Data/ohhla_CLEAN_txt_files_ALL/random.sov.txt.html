[Lady Sovereign]
E'rybody in the club gettin tipsy
Oh fuck dat, just whine like a gypsy
Can't see straight, like I got one eye
{*pop*} Your bottle opener or mine
Let's... get started
Move ya arms round like fucked up karate
Ohh, shit! My word play's nasty
Ohh, shit! Don't put it past me
Move, titch - get out the... way
Now e-nough of dat, I'm here to, stayyyy
Flow lazy
Pick the pace up when I flow less hazy
J-Lo's got a batty
Well you can't see mine cause I wear my trousers baggy
Anyways; yeah, let's... commence...

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Everybody get random - all gyal dem, all man dem 
Everybody get random - just do somethin random 

[Lady Sovereign]
Smokin kills and so do my lyrics
If you're poppin pills then trust you're not with it
Cause I got the skills, and I'm over the limit
Dishin lyrics like meals every second every minute
Ding! Dong! Special Delivery (hello)
Biggest midget in the game, can't get rid of me
Give me just a minute and I'll be your vicinity
My words hurt you just like losin virginity (oww!)
Well I'm, right thurr
Naw, tell a lie cause I'm, right there
Right hurr, nah, right here
Now get off your churr, I mean chair
Some English MC's get it twisted
Start sayin COOKIES instead of biscuits!
Anyways; yeah, let's... commence...

[Chorus] - 2X

[Lady Sovereign]
Yo, get up and do somethin random
Yo watch it now
One, two, Sov is comin for you
Three four, better lock your door
Five six, well I'm full of tricks
So everybody come and vibe with the likkle titch
swiiiiiitch....

Just check how my flow differs
I'm droppin lyrics like a hole droppin knickers
I'm on a whole other level, I'm old school
Like {?}, fry up the Snickers
This shit's hot, where the sniffer though?
Let's get random, zagga-zagga-zagga yo
You wanna come and test me well bring it on
If it's the new ting, then ooh sing along
S-O-Veeee~!

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
