[Intro: Professor Griff]
Forgive me for I have sinned

[Professor Griff]
I firmly think it's a crime to drop dime
On a brother of your own kind
A damned disgrace to show your face
Give you something I can chew this bass
On your own race
In a D.O.A. case
So sample this, my 8-0-8 disk
Then don't you dare miss
The L.A.D. kickin' in action
Tell your next of kin of the colored attraction
The A.G.S. the black ghetto assassin
Will destroy the thought of you colored in the White House
Now you quiet as a goddamn church mouse
You distort the scripture as you paint the picture
Of the man who paid the ultimate price
He gave his life
Six thousand years later you claim to be doin' us a favor
By painting his face green, right?
Wrong
Check God's song

Read the headlines
Doin' the whitelines
Sellin' out to the white lady
Suzi's pile of toot drive me crazy
Committing the worst of sin
Heh, and now you're doin' it again
Kill from K.C., you see
A sheep from the black nation
Who's on the mental starvation
Lack of the right food, I know it's rude
But I'm here and I got mine
Up my sleeve no tricks but a nine
And I'll find time to rock this jam
If I can
Disguised in Levi's
The blinds of lies

You tell the North America jail cell
Two thousand by three thousand
Fifty states
Haloes, wings and the pearly white gates

We'll escape the rapture
After the black capture their freedom
Now, are you willing and able
To be the place at your table
For the black man
I might surprise ya, it's Elijah

Give me the mic and a stage
Then, turn the page
Checkin' for a anti-nazi raid
Release the pen for the ravage
So lost in a metal passage
You think you're grown then hold your own
Get the fuck off the telephone
And beat me, then you'll see I'm pullin' ya back
With some black facts
To counterattack that bullshit
'Cause I ain't havin' it
Nor am I wit' it
Ya ball-of-confusing me is nonsense
It's not worth about two cents

It's pathetic to think you're Semitic
It's always done by those of a foolish critic, got it
You can fool the blind
But now it's time to rhyme, check this out, UHH

Now if you got a problem I toke you in
My knees won't bend
But if you wanna dance, I take a chance
Grab the D and get lazy
To please some sorry ass milktoast faggot you must be crazy
It was serious, you see
Lee shocked me
Into a state of unanwareness of the real problem - Cash
Oh, no, G, I bust your ass

Huhh! I got a work jacket, and the tools to match
Nigger ain't clean
With a poison cap, HUHH
The short guy has a complex
So who's next to expect, me to apologize
And the tears in my eyes will never fall
As I give you the last and final call
Come on, HUHH

Aww yeah

Together forever
Brother to brother, P.E.
I like dat
HUHH</pre>
