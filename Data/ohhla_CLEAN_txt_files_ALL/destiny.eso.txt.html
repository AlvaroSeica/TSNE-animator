Song:   Destiny Lane
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

From a crooked cottage on the hill
I can see tomorrow's rain
Rumble through destiny
Down a Sleepy Hollow lane
If we're all merely players
In a play on this great stage
The problem is the script writers
Ain't on the same page

I echo through the mountain
When I'm singing in the air
From my lab
A lad with lavish lyrics
Living in his lair

I just write in my haven
Set the challenge so to speak
Recite it to my raven
Like Edgar Allan Poe-try
I've been serving gems
With a thin swerving pen
Transcribe the world
I see through a Tim Burton lens
To the grim certain end
These rebels stay proud
Hear the levels way loud
At the Devil's Playground

From my tower at sunset
I watch all the misled
Slow motion
Human lemmings
Running to the cliff's edge
With this said
Let's get free from their grasp
'cause there's no path
To peace ya'll
Peace is the path

So I chill under the arctic
With my mellow cup of tea
And broadcast transmissions
From my Yellow Submarine
I've been trekking this trail
Since the earth was born
I sail my Black Pearl
Through this world's Perfect Storm
It's like

See every night
Through my eyes is a window
I watch life pass by
Like the wind blows
And when I turn from my mirror
That's my intro
To step into this life
With my mic and some inspi... ration
Please forgive me
For my sins though
When I'm alone in the dark
Left in limbo
I light a thought
Like the spark to my Indo
Forever put it down
For my art and my kinfolk

I'm a field full of flowers
I'm 'a bring it back by dinner
I'm the skill
I'm the power
I'm a silverback gorilla
You steal a caterpillar
Thinking your killer raps are iller
So while you beef
I'm fishing, writing, chilling
By the river

So let me introduce you
To my castle of calligraphy
The lights are on
We're all at home
We march to a new symphony
That Mad Hatter
Of that motion music
Whose liquid lyricism
Leaves the oceans moonlit
So my pirate ship can set sail
Through the sun, rain, snow or hail
'cause there's something 'bout to happen
Like there's something in the wind
On a quest without a vest
Like I'm Huckleberry Finn

So call me that book
With a spectacular twist
'cause even Hogwarts
Ain't seen magic like this
See I'm that author in the addict
That'll liberate the mind
With a bird's eye view
Trying to illustrate time
I was born ready

See every night
Through my eyes is a window
I watch life pass by
Like the wind blows
And when I turn from my mirror
That's my intro
To step into this life
With my mic and some inspi... ration
Please forgive me
For my sins though
When I'm alone in the dark
Left in limbo
I light a thought
Like the spark to my Indo
Forever put it down
For my art and my kinfolk</pre>
