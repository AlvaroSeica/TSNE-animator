[Buddha Monk]
Excuse me, baby, can we talk for a minute?
I got something to say, I hope that you wit it
What's ya name love? Hah, they call me Daddy Warbucks
Bad under the collar, a king sex driver
I'm digging you, lord, I wanna twist ya fruits
Clinch let too, buy you a house or two
You're a boogaboo, thug love, sugar in cup
How many lumps does it take, baby, to get to your love
Until the ends of time, girly, I truly adore you
Applaud you, lady, for the way that you walk too
Let it be known, this cat, is bad to the bone
Missing one thing, baby, that's burn through ya rug
Ya feeling my love?

[Chorus: Buddha Monk]
Loving you, baby, it ain't a thing
And do you, love the way I swing my thing

[Buddha Monk]
What's ya preference, baby, of a man, hold you tight?
Cook you breakfast in the morning, with the eggs just right
I'm out of that type, it's thug love, skip the back rubs
Hot sex on the platter, where it's at, it doesn't matter
Fact is, when I'm done, you sweaty and breathless
Wreckless, nipples harder than Led Zeppelin
The kind of love read in books by L. Hardbird
The outer cover reads, how to nut inside her
A breaker breaker ride her, B.D. up in wide, her
Then dine her, to a place with cheesburgers and fries where
You all that I need, I be there for you
As long as you keep it tight, I'll be there for you
You feeling me, boo?

[Chorus] </pre>
