Song:   Do You Drink
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I have a disease that they don't know what to call
I'm an alcoholic, trip until I fall retarded
Thick headed, sick invidual, lyric credentials critical
Medical, better do something to get him through
I ain't standing up, I'm layin down under
I need the cable cause driving I ain't able to do
See a stop sign, I run right through
Drive even though my brother's sleeve is spewing a flood
Okay, the ladies want a couple cups and pink panties
Yea, give me a couple cups and they can't stand me
KCT, Carobu and some foofoo drinks
And you won't care if you stick ladies

[Chorus]
Do you drink?
Look away now
There's nothing to see here
I... I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons of KCT
I want the world to have a drink with me
Do you drink?
Look away now
There's nothing to see here
I... I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons and gallons of badulu
I'm running right through you
Okay, do you drink?

[Verse 2]
I don't drink but yo ass said no no
I know I tried, I almost died back in '04 though
Club maniacs, it was a spot where we watched all the top notch crotch like a nice watch watch tryna
I let lil mama way about my lead
Gucci Prada bout the dollar like ya ta ta ra ra
Okay, whatever game, I'd get at it together
Booty lookin fatter than ever
Almost had to have to let it go
Had to leave her alone, I took a sip of Patrone
And show darling and start calling out my louds
Never mind, shit coming out her clothes
Walk the other way, what would you think
But Shawty...

[Chorus]
Do you drink?
Look away now
There's nothing to see here
I... I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons of KCT
I want the world to have a drink with me
Do you drink?
Look away now
There's nothing to see here
I... I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons and gallons of badulu
I'm running right through you
Okay, do you drink?

[Verse 3]
I'm the king of flip cup and beer pong
"99 bottles of beer" song and a beer bong
I take a irish car bomb and a screw driver
Make me up a boiler maker, I ain't trippin, you drivin
Pool full of liquor then you dive in
I've been drinkin liquor since I've been alive and drivin
Don't consume more than you can handle
If you gag so walk and spill it on your front
Teeth have never spilled the wine back on senel
People probably never asked you

[Chorus]
Do you drink?
Look away now
There's nothing to see here
I... I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons of KCT
I want the world to have a drink with me
Do you drink?
Look away now
There's nothing to see here
I... I'm just happy to be here
Gallons and gallons and gallons of badulu
I'm running right through you
Okay, do you drink?

Do you drink?!</pre>
