Chorus:
[LeeLee]    Oh, baby, come with me tonight
[Baby Bash] Comin' with you, tonight
            I-I-I'm comin' with you, tonight
[LeeLee]    O-oh, don't wanna let you out of my sight
[Baby Bash] Won't let you out of my sight
            I'll, I'll won't let you out of my sight

[Verse 1: Nino Brown (LeeLee)]
I'm feeling super bad, like I'm a rolling stone
Can I get a flick, with your hips, thoroughbred to the bone
I'm feeling super fly, off this here 'Tron and 'Tron
Lickin' your lips, doin' your tricks, get your arco on (Uh, arco on)

Pre-Chorus: Nino Brown (LeeLee) {Nino Brown &amp; LeeLee}
Diamond girl, you look so good, she say them creases on my
Edward Harley {Looks so hood}
Say mami, you so, you so
Bad, I wish, I {Wish I could}
Love you here, I swear, you just
Way too sexy for my hood (For my hood)

[Verse 2: Nino Brown]
Oooh wee, she tuggin' my Donna, she think I'm Carlos Santana
Puffin' on somethin' Ivana, it feel like Copa Cabana
Plus M.I.A. in the buildin', yeah homey, that's my familia
Yes sir, we grindin' familiars until my fer's at the ceiling
Ya feel me

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Nino Brown (Nino Brown &amp; LeeLee)]
I'm feelin' super Sly, A.K.A. Stallone
Man, I got a bad super breezy, all up (In my zone)
She purr like calico, she (Super natural)
She like Sophia, Colombia, (International)
Oh yeah, I pimp it like Chente, Beezy, he all in your mente
Blueberry diamonds are bling
Mira mami, make me sang (Oh!)

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus Twice

Bridge: LeeLee {Nino Brown in background}
I could see it in your eyes
That you just wanna get away
And baby, if my hands could talk
Then you would hear 'em say the same {LET'S GO!}
I could see it in your eyes (I could see it in your eyes)
That you just wanna get away (You just wanna get away)
And baby, if my hands could talk (Baby, if my hands could talk)
Then you would hear 'em say the same (And you would hear 'em say the same)
