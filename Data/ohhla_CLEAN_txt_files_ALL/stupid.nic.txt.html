[Intro]
Uh, yo! Yo!

[Nicki Minaj]
I get it crackin like a bad back
Bitch talkin she the queen when she lookin like the lab rat
I'm Angelina, you Jennifer
C'mon bitch, you see where Brad at
Ice my wrists-es, then I piss on bitches
You could suck my diz-nick if you take this jizzes
You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business
'Cause I pull up and I'm stuntin, but I ain't a stuntman
Yes, I rock Jordan's, but I ain't a jumpman
Bitches play the back because they know I'm the frontman
Put me on the dollar, 'cause I'm who they trust-in
Aiyyo SB, what the fuck's good?
We ship platinum, them bitches is shippin wood
Them nappy-headed hoes, but my kitchen good
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish a bitch woooooooooooooo-
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooould

[Chorus]
You a stupid hoe, you a you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe, you a you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe, you a you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe, yeah you a you a stupid hoe
You a stupid hoe, you a you a stupid hoe (stupid-stupid)
You a stupid hoe, you a you a stupid hoe (You stupid-stupid)
You a stupid hoe, you a you a stupid hoe (You stupid-stupid)
You a stupid hoe (You stupid-stupid), yeah you a you a stupid hoe (You stupid-stupid)

[Nicki Minaj]
Look Bubbles, go back to your habitat (ah-ah!)
MJ callin and I ain't havin that
How you gon' be the stunt double to the nigga monkey?
On top of that, I'm in the Phantom lookin hella chunky
Ice my wrists-es, then I piss on bitches
You could suck my diz-nick if you take this jizzes
You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business
'Cause I pull up in that Porsche/Portia, but I ain't de Rossi
Pretty bitches only could get in my posse
Yes, my name is Roman, last name is Zolanski
But no relation to Roman Polanski
Hey yo Baby Bop, fuck you AND your EP!
Who's gassin this hoe? BP?
...Hmm, thinks
One two three to the Nicki Minaj blink
'Cause these hoes so busted, hoes is so crusty
These bitches is my sons and I don't want custody
Hoes so busted, hoes is so crusty
These bitches is my sons and I don't want custody

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
If you cute, then the crew could roll
If you sexy, eat my cucka roll
Put ya cape on, you a super hoe
2012, IÂ’m at the Super Bowl
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid hoe shoulda befriended me, then she coulda prol'ly came back
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid hoe shoulda befriended me, then she coulda prol'ly came back
You're a stupid hoe, you're a stupid hoe
You're a stuuuu-oooo-oooooh-pid hoooooooe.. and I ain't hit that note 
But fuck you stupid hoe, you fuckin stupid hoe!
I said fuck a stupid hoe, dat fuckin stupid hoe!
I said fuck a stupid hoe, dat fuckin stupid hoe!
I said a-fuck a stupid hoe, dat fuckin stupid hoe!
