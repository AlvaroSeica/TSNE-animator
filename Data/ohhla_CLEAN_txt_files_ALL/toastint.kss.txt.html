{*tapping on his glass*} A-hem
I'd like to say a few words
{*coughing*} Excuse me
I thank all y'all for comin out tonight
We all gathered here at this table, to celebrate
the brothers we lost in the struggle
Those that fell victim to the street
All our loved ones behind the wall
And most of all to the new up and coming cats
Paying homage, to those that paved the way
Let's toast to that, CHEERS~! {*glasses clink*}
AH-HAH!</pre>
