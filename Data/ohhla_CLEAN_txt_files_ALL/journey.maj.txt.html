[Chorus: Madam Majestic]
I've never been the jealous type
And I'm not the one to start the fight
You won't catch me staying out all night
Be back before the due hits and the day is light

[Madam Majestic]
I've been around the way, you for a while
For quite some time, you should know me by now
Seems that lately you've been trying to make me
Have a lot of explaining to do

[Chorus]

[Madam Majestic]
I wonder about you...
Cuz you've got style about you
But you have got to chill
Oooh, baby, because I want to still
Be with you...

[Chorus]

[Madam Majestic]
They, power, for hours and hours
We both can't be selfish, cuz this here, is our world
They, power, for hours and hours
We both can't be selfish, cuz this here, is our world

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
