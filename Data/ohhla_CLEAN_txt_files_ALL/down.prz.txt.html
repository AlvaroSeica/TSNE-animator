RBGs, RBGs, Nigga it's dat RBGs
RBGs, RBGs, Nigga it's dat RBGs

Tell me are you down? when it's goin down
You got to hold it down, don't talk it hold it down
Tell me are you down? when it's goin down
You got to hold it down, when it's goin down

Have you ever had a lesson from a OG?
From a nigga that's been in the war
Been locked up longer than I been on the earth
And his crime is defendin the poor
And they can tell you bout death, tell you bout life
But most of all they tell you bout sacrifice
And they can tell if a woman aint with you when you down
cuz she never really could be your wife
What it mean to be D-O-W-N?
Is ya homies still down when it's trouble you in?
You wanna have a good time make it hot when the pigs come down on the block
Would they fuck wit you then?
Now you wanna get high wit me, organize wit me
Start a clothes drive then maybe we can start a fire
Where my RBGs?  My guerillas wit a G-U-E
Don't got a I-Ching homey get free

Who number 1 when we ride? We follow the plan
and there's a role for every man
With a chain of command even when the shit hit the fan
Anything get outta hand we still stand
To me bein down mean more than bein friends, or kin
We comrades we struggle, through any trouble
Sacrifice my life in combat for ya
So you know I gotta love ya I'm down for my brothas
And sistas, fuck the system, bust ya pistols, nigga I'm with ya
Just put a rag on ya face when you ride
You don't want them satellites to take ya picture
We gotta have a lot of discipline and it comes from within
It's not somethin you pretend, homey
A lot of niggas be talkin that shit when it really goes down it be gone with
the wind, homey
Can't be no tower(?), gotta get this power by any means
Gotta know yaself and ya enemy when you puttin it down for ya family
Can't tell by no tattoo, can't tell by no handshake
It's scarred in the heart(?), bein down is an attitude
Doin what you gotta do, for the crew's sake
My definition of a soulja, Revolutionary, Military Minded, And ready for
whatever
Nigga hope for the best and prepare for the worst
Stay aware be alert bomb first, don't tell me

Tell me are you down? when it's goin down
You got to hold it down, don't talk it hold it down
Homey tell me are you down? when it's goin down
You got to hold it down, don't talk it hold it down
Homey tell me are you down?</pre>
