[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
you got the wrong one, if you think I ain't gonna go out
you used to be the only girl a nigga would think about
I gotta couple of girls on call, I'm a bring em out
a magic city stripper, huh, so this is what it's all about
I'm in the club doing my two steps I pulled about eight broads already
I'm just getting my feet wet (damn)
but I ain't even knocking your style
see I be here all day tryna count how many girls want bow
huh, see you on the blogs with your dude and all that
but little do you know, you making yourself look wack
If dude gotta problem, better tell him to fall back
I'm blowing real big in vip, yea that loud pack
see it's me and chris in here (breezy),
so you know it's real thick in here
better cuff your girl because your bitch in here
tryna see how many I can fit in my lambo
I never go raw, stay strapped like rambo

[Chorus]
I'm not looking for love, cause she's gone
so tell all the girls that the bottles on us
get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
find a lil shawty I like
girl when I'm up in the club, really turnt up
I ain't goin think about you (na na na na)
(aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
we been together for a minute
now it's feels funny to be doing some different
but it's all good me and you finish,
you callin' me player but a nigga ain't trippin
and I ain't I sayin' that he don't love you, but I don't think he love you like I do
but it's okay, it's alright, my blackberry's filled with a whole bunch of women
wasting time, steady tryna get you back, get you back in my life, hey, you don't care you don't care
It used to be you that I like but I'm a do what I like tonight
I'm gon' get tipsy
over 21 all the girls have fun and watch the ladies jump on me

[Chorus]
I'm not looking for love, cause she's gone
so tell all the girls that the bottles on us
get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
find a lil shawty I like
girl when I'm up in the club, really turnt up
I ain't goin think about you (na na na na)
(aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night)

[Bow Wow]

I'm bein' honest listen shawty I don't want you no more
so leave the keys to the benz before you hit the front door
cause you loosin'

couldn't do that
so I'm a tell you how I feel
huh, I poppin bottles all night cause them black cards ain't got no limit alright

[Chorus]
I'm not looking for love, cause she's gone
so tell all the girls that the bottles on us
get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
find a lil shawty I like
girl when I'm up in the club, really turnt up
I ain't goin think about you (na na na na)
(aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night)
