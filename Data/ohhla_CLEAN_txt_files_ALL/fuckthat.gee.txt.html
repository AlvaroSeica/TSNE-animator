What's up (what's up) nigga
Act like you know who this is
If you don't know who this is nigga
It's Lil' B. Gizzle, it ain't B. Geezie no more
You understand, it's Chopper City Records nigga
You heard me, for 2002, and I'ma give it to you
Uncut and raw, look

[B.G.]
It's bout time I bring B. Gizzle, on the scene
Remind niggas, who forgot I'm still bout that beef
And I brings the heat, if it's daylight or night time
I bangs heat, from AK's, macks and nines
Now I ride, believe me when I stress that there
Or that round thang on your neck, I'ma wet that there
Split that there, splat that there, bust that there
And this ain't conversation lil one, trust that there
I hit your set with that K, and up that there
You can't duck from them 50 shots, or run nowhere
Right where you stand my nigga, you done right there
Mama hollin', don't let that be my son right there
Well mama I'm sorry, that's your son right there
His body, his brains, and his long wife there
Ain't bout to let no nigga play me, fuck that there
They find you smelling like a skunk, same time next year

[Hook - 2x]
I'ma set these niggas straight, fuck that shit
Well I'ma put em in they place, fuck that shit
And let em know B. Gizzle here to stay, fuck that shit
Now if you down with me nigga, holla fuck that shit

[B.G.]
If I say it I say it, cause I mean that there
If my finger on the trigger, gotta squeeze that there
I'm a hustler bout my money, so I keeps that work
Play with me I'll put you six feet, in that dirt
Mopping off, you know you could get stole like that
Thugging in public, B. Gizzle roll like that
Ki's of coke, ounces of dope, I sold that there
Narcotics period, I sold that there
Jacking niggas, killing niggas, I did that shit
If it come with this life of crime, I lived that shit
Knifes a motherfucker, if I'm telling the truth
They'll tell you ain't no telling, what Geezie'd do
Convicted felon, with a firearm quick to draw down
Think I'm playing play with me, watch how quick I draw down
Watch how quick I load it, cock it and set this bitch off
Just like now, I'm bout this set this bitch off

[Hook - 2x]
I'ma set these niggas straight, fuck that shit
Well I'ma put em in they place, fuck that shit
And let em know B. Gizzle here to stay, fuck that shit
Now if you down with me nigga, won't you grab your dick

[B.G.]

And I got the sawed off pump, got the uzi got the K nigga
You better run but you can't run, cause you done you done diggity
Done dadda, motherfucker it's blocka blocka
From the chopper, it's no more existence for you
It's no resistance for you, but for me it's straight up
I'm a winner, not a beginner, I'm a veteran to this shit
I've been doing this shit a long time
Nigga know bout me, nigga know I'm bout mine
And I'ma shine nigga, it's 2000 and 2
So what the fuck you wanna do, it's Chopper City Records
Niggas thought I wasn't gon do it, niggas thought I wouldn't be successful
But look at me now, look at me standing tall
