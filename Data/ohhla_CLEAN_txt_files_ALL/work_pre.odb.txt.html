[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Dirty, ya'll niggas get the fuck up
I'm out of jail, nigga, I'm out of jail
(Get the fuck out of here muthafucka)
(Welcome home, nigga) Dirty, Dirty
If y'all don't get the fuck up
I'ma swoll one of you muthafucka's eyes shut-in
It's Dirt McGirt, muthafucka

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Ya'll know who I am, what?
Dirt McGirt, baby, whose the man?
What part you fools don't understand?
Been away now, I'm back by popular demand
Ain't a damn thing changed, nigga, back up
First nigga to act up, get smacked up
Orange suits on hand, Dirty this, Dirty that
Yo, where Dirty at? But now Dirty back
My girl is nasty, her booty is stank
I fucked her all night, until a nigga shoot blanks
Doggystyle, won't ever spill my drink
Then smoke a blunt, and watch the shit on tape
You can sit on my face, I like the taste
If my P.O. call, tell that bitch to wait
I break your face, invade your space
Don't make the mistake, tell me who is in the place what?

[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yeah, let me see you work something
Slow down, don't hurt nothing
You nasty, ain't ya? You freaky, ain't ya? (Yeah, Dirty)
Get ya ass over here, shake it like ya just don't care
Now bounce-bounce, move it over here, now
Work, work, move it over here

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Aiyo, I'm still that nigga that just don't give a fuck
Where's that Hennessey at? Fill up a cup
Brooklyn, where you at? Come on, give me love
What the fuck you want? What? Nigga, what?
That's right, yeah, I'm working overtime
Fresh out the pits, signed and the clothing line
And I keep a pretty chick right by my side
And I drive fucked, getting D.U.I.'s
On the streets they show me love cuz real niggaz feel me
Keep shit on me, pitbulls with me
Smack a nigga silly, won't show pity
Dirt McGirt, the most gritty in the city
Do it like Willie, make a bitch show her titties
You now the dealy, the hoes don't get a penny
Everybody got their hand out for dollars
That's why I stay in drama, with all my baby mamas

[Chorus]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'm dirty, just like the dirty south
I talk dirty, wash out my dirty mouth
I'm dirty, just like the dirty south
Talk dirty, wash out my dirty mouth
What, nigga? Why you wanna get me started?
Got me in the club with Tha Alkaholiks
On the down low, like I'm ducking the warrant
Getting head in the back by the bathroom toilet
There's booty all around, let me see the performance
She down for whatever, you know I'm all for it
Gotta spark hard, hop in sports bar
After this, it's the Marriot courtyard
Gold card, I'ma max it out
Just keep your titties shaking and the apples out
You can, stick around, honey, that's no doubt
Bust a nut, then I'm passing out

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
