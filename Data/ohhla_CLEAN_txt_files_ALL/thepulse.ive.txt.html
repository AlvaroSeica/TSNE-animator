[Verse 1]
Allow me to scale the basins edges cast afar from hours stationary
Momentum gathering quick around the outskirts of my haven
It seem a semi embedded existence had plans for relocation
Handling paper work is tiresome to swing the weights and cranes
That add to the movement which is sceptical, I'd hardly call that growth
Ushered along a fishing wire, promised a presentation of hope
Which turned out to be a let down, set you off, give it your best
Find an entrance to the pipeworks to dodge the intersections
Plus I know these underpasses well, we have an understanding
Free to come and go as I please so long as I take some time to ramble
About whatever architecture teaches patience if you let it
Jimy up the tiles and brick work, make a mess 'til hearts content
Shimmy up to the perches edge avoiding treadmill mangulation
The air is somewhat bearable at this altitude of makeshift ventilation
Paper mills belch a smog of bitter sweetness
We're one thousand storeys tumbleweed unseen but worthy of breathing
Compare that to the bustle of ivory bone pin stripe madness
Duties seem to drive the occupance of a three piece Trojan gallop 
into the sand trails
On my signal open the flood gates
Watch the beauty in destruction unfold all over the rat race

[Chorus]
Resting under the pulse, under the skin, content with where I sit
World watching faceless as the mayhem steadily loses grip
In an over populated coma patent ward it's a given
For cogs to turn and brave the rusty build up from the system

Resting under the pulse, under the skin, content with where I fit
World watching faceless as the mayhem steadily loses grip
In an over populated coma patent ward it's a given
For cogs to solder on in fear of disturbing the rhythm

[Verse 2]
Snap out of that hypothetical daze from flicking filters aimlessly
Straining against the aggression of the current fighting mainly
For a chance to disturb the peace and split the title wave single file
through the gap, down the middle - keep actions simple
When dealing with the Venus trifid intentions are to punctuate physics
At any sign of a threat scare tactics cease to impress
Plus I'm too worn down by the glare shot around and amplified
by these pain glass windmills clipping the sky 
that seem to have sprung up over night
side by side yet out of sync, irregular blocks are building up
Rapidly changing the face of how landscape breathes in the wake
All that aside soldier on and venture still into the thick of it
Trudging about my business here, fail safe to be passive
When seeking refuge once again to piece together collections made
Salvaging what's possible after sweeping up the miscarriage
The result of an overstayed unwanted welcome
from both sides of the spectrum
Watch tower spotted desired destination, praised make haste
Barely made it half way up the crows nest, swallowed in an instant
Tedious indeed the need to rejuvinate chances grave
Shited once again admit defeat, back to the basin
Naive underline of change so light a candle for this day

[Chorus]
Resting under the pulse, under the skin, content with where I sit
World watching faceless as the mayhem steadily loses grip
In an over populated coma patent ward it's a given
For cogs to turn and brave the rusty build up from the system

Resting under the pulse, under the skin, content with where I fit
World watching faceless as the mayhem steadily loses grip
In an over populated coma patent ward it's a given
For cogs to solder on in fear of disturbing the rhythm</pre>
