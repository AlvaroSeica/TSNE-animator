Verse 1

Back to the rugged, back to the ratchets and muskets
These bastards are crabs in a bucket
Tracks get constructed, tight like we strapped with a budget
Magnums,cannons clutch it, hammers erupted
Cash get deducted, damaging the structure
Marxman, c4 packets in the muffler
Panic when I puncture, bar for bar spoken
Art of war, left you in the corridor broken
All the broads open, Vicki draws soaking
Clear the route quickly, air him out smoke him
Appear like an omen, know your fam heard of me
Plan formed perfectly, expand foreign currency
I scan where the serpents be, men attempting burglary
send them to emergency, left their denim burgundy
Netherlands to Germany, weapons cause static,
Flesh torn like fabric, my essence holographic

Chorus:

The industry investing in artists, excessive while
The rest of them starving
I don't respect that garbage
My message is their records are horrid, they dress them in expensive garments
I don't respect that garbage
The industry investing in artists, excessive while the rest
Of them starving
I don't respect that garbage
I'm a rep my sector regardless, Marxman the rest of them targets  2x

Verse 2

I've returned from my hiatus, hi haters
Always trying to bother the dude like wild neighbors
Silence the traitors, fuck your disguised favors
I'm in Brooklyn like bodegas and now or laters
Want a thousand acres, your cursed when you hear the growl
Peers are foul, trying to reverse engineer the style
Clear and loud,  dispelling the mystic
Slept with the wicked Jezebels in the district
Knelt and they kissed it, everything exquisite
From they nails to their lipstick tail, when they visit
Hailed as a misfit, smoking to provoke the thoughts
Focused force, and it opens like a Trojan horse
Foes get tossed, and left them with a swollen lip
Broken ribs, and jetted in a stolen whip
So legit, they are frauds when its all revealed
Marxman, fuck your recording deal
