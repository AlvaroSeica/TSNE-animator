[Chorus: Luck]
Cause I look good, I look good
Girl, I look so good
Look so good, look so good
Girl, I look so good
From my head to my toes
You already know
From my head to my toes
You already know

That I look good, I look good
Girl, I look so good
Look so good, look so good
Girl, I look so good
From my head to my toes
You already know
From my head to my toes
You already know

That I look good, I look good
Girl, I look so good
Look so good, look so good
Girl, I look so good
From my head to my toes
You already know
From my head to my toes
You already know
I look good

[Doe Hicks]
Y'all know I keep big dickin these hoes
They tickle me so bad I think about Twitpic'n these hoes
Plus I look good, plus I told my momma
That after she left her baby so she ain't shouts out to my comers
Behead them bad bitches, I'm used to that
When I should respect, I am, this is no booty play
I-I-I got there soft, white baby on me
That's why they call me, 50 Cent has played a shorty
And I can't even lie, you know I'm the truth
I mean that and she credit for because it's cute

[Chorus] - first two stanzas

[Savvy]
I look good though, magnificent
Catch you in the mix, hopin we can be intimate
I'mma dib and dill, ho smilin from ear to ear
Savvy been a playa, I kill the swag throw me the chair
I'm too cute, ballin baby we huge
We can make a movie but right now I need a preview
My rockin Ribatta jeans got number my self esteem
Just look in the mirror
Just look, ain't that nigga clean?
If I want it I grab it
I bribe, I wear it
Head over heel with them horses
I'm a polo fanatic
I leave them bitches exstatic and they see me attractive
I live my life like a pimp, you might see me with glasses

[Chorus] - first stanza

[David Banner]
Now I'm comin back from Paris
I'm shoppin liftin so lavish
My wheel sittin on Ferris
Uh what you girlfriend girlfriend talk about?
I fuck her 'til she beats then I walk her out
I never had to put 'em in the parking lot
I lay like that better park a lot
Show dudes, show you what's coming out next year
What's coming in the future
When I say your bitch I know I'm pointin in the future
Yea nigga cute, act so bitch, umm what to do?
Aks your friend, I fucked her too
That thing nigga, I don't fuck with you
Uh, I don't think it, bitch, I know it
My self-esteem's on bricks, I let my ego fuckin tow it
I don't talk about money, I let my wardrobe show it
If your closet tells a story then mine shits a stork nigga

[Chorus] - first stanza</pre>
