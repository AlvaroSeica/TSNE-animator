[will.i.am]
Dar he Dar he go
Day he dar he go
Day he dar he go

She got a big ol butt, I like the way she move it
come be my butter cup and let me double scoop it
Girl you's a mama jamma you make this boy go loco
let me whip out my camera so I can take your photo
If I could work it out
that means I must be the luckiest nig in the house
because your donkey is steady pa-pa-pa-pocking out
the kind I'm looking after
girl is it genuine? That's what I have to ask ya

She got some mega ass I like the way she's dancing
Now baby is it bad if I keep on glancing
she said boy go ahead as long I don't touch
I said now why the hell would I want to interrupt it

to be kinda hard being D O double G
