Gettin' started
Dedicated
To my muthafuckin' nigga AWOL
(It's do or die muthafucka --&gt; CRIPS' CRIPPIN' AIN'T EASY)
I love you Cuz
Forever nigga
That's real
(Do or die muthafucka --&gt; CRIPS' CRIPPIN' AIN'T EASY)

[G-BONE]
It's about the muthafuckin' time
For a nigga to trip
So I grab that Mac-10 out the back
Jump in my shit to death
Now my mission
Is the 1-8-7
To send them muthafucker straight to hell
So I park the ?? at the dark
So it'd be cool for one nigga to bail
Since I'm a vic
I might as well ??bet straight up??
Only nigga but it'd be better
If I come from the back cause I can manage to packin' them niggas
That's what I do I hit them fools with that Smith and Tec
With that Mac fifteen niggas hit their muthafuckin' backs (mack-mack-mack)
Was all
That them niggas heard and for three
Of them fools was the last that them niggas heard
They ass got served
Then I skirted back
To my side
Put out my strap
Ground my sacking then I hit the drive
Posted till the next day I'm gettin' high, I'm with two
Of my fellow B-A-B-Y G's on my side
For them niggas and them bitches who asked why muthafuckas
This is how I'ma do it to the day that I die

This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die
This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die
This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die
This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die

[G-BONE]
This is how I'ma do it till I'm six feet down
Under the dirt
Saggin' the flag in gettin' ready for mess
And when it's time to put in some work
I let the Gat jar
Then nigga I skirt
Back to the muthafuckin' turf
Back in the hood with the bone sack
Big Bone nigga you got some blood on your shirt
Oh, nigga don't panic
It's just that little muthafuckin' Damu
Come here Lil' Bone
Hey Locs, I just have to dumb this fool
Keep it on the down-low though don't let nobody know 
I'ma tell all the homies to watch they asses
The po-po's hot
And it look like somebody's just got blasted
It was on our enemies side so
All y'all niggas didn't get posted up
Cause you know that
Nigga be thinkin' about comin' through open the casket to the one of us
And I can't see nuthin' I'm goin' out
So y'all niggas better paid attention (niggas)
And I'm gettin' to the maraud
While I'm bailin' off from that 'gnac I be sippin'
I'm back to the tent
So I blaze up a blunt so a nigga can get high
This is how I'ma do it and I'ma do it until the day that I die

This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die
This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die
This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die
This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die

I'ma keep on Crippin nigga -- until the day that I die
I'ma keep on Crippin nigga -- until the day that I die
I'ma keep on Crippin nigga -- until the day that I die
I'ma keep on Crippin nigga -- until the day that I die

[G-BONE]
Until the day that I die
Nigga I'll be write homicide
1-8-7 is the nigga only way sometimes for survivin'
Hoo-Ride niggas dyin'
Everynight everyday sometimes even the afternoon
It's like
The city of doom
The end of the world is comin' real soon
But if niggas could get together
We could be tougher than leather or do whatever
I ??? just my
Life could be a whole lot better but
Until the day that I die
I be pullin' the trigger in front of the nigga come in my hood
Bangin' is still same (die muthafucka!)
Anybody killer
Stickin' my dick in the bitch all free
Cause I be known the dick-a-bitch down
Bustin' them nuts
Bustin' them guts
At all the bitches of my home town
Nigga Comptown
My stamping ground
Is known around the city my name
Gangsta muthafuckin' Bone
And niggas you know what hood I claim
True to the game
And all you muthafuckas know the Rip Ride
This is how I'ma do it and I'm gonna do it until the day that I die

This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die
This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die
This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die
This is how I'ma do it I'm gonna do it until the day that I die</pre>
