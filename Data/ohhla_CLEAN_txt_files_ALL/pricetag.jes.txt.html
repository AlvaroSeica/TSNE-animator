Okay
Coconut man, Moonheads and P
You ready?

Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night?
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second
Just stop, for a minute and
Smile

Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious?
You got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good, time

Everybody look to their left (huh)
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that?  Yeah
We're paying with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only one gettin', tired?

Why is everybody soooo obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now
Guarantee we'll be feeling all right?

Everybody look to their left (to the left)
Everybody look to their right (to the right)
Can you feel that?  Yeah
We're paying with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

[B.o.B]
Yeah yeah
Well, keep the price tag
And take the cash back
Just give me six streams (six streams) and a half stack (half stack)
And you can keep the cars
Leave me the garage
And all I.
Yes all I need are keys and guitars
And guess what, in 30 seconds I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah we leaving across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on the life
We do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice everynight
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall never
Waiting to see, a sign of defeat, uh uh
So we gon keep everyone moving their feet
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing
