[Intro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Word, Thug Bible chapter thirteen
Another Red Hook Crime Family jewel
Niggas be runnin they mouth on the phone
Shits be tapped, Deal with it

[Chorus 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
To all the hustlers in the street, Make sure you stack bail money
To all the hustlers in the street, Make sure you stack bail money
To all the hustlers in the street, Make sure you stack bail money
And rappers in this industry, Make sure you stack bail money

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Ayo we used to bag it up after we chop it
Put it on the block make a profit
Raise street value, Corner the market
Hit you with some hot shit when we cock it
Chase shook workers, Shake down their pockets
Blast em up leave em butt naked with swollen sockets
Me and pump was quick to snuff once we puff the chocolate
Ran funky's spot till the feds pad locked it
Multiple indictment cases called from a ???
Family blew trial, Juvenile went to ???
Came home the game was cold, Started diggin pockets
Icy chains with trains, Hit the pawn shot the ???
Now we cook albums like these fiends cop it
The shot it in their vein like heron when we pop it
Hustle all night make the sales sky rocket
His rap sale money is like crack sale money
Industry's like jail nigga stack bail money

[Chorus 2: Shabazz the Disciple]
So if you hustle in the streets, Make sure you stack bail money
To all the hustlers in the street, Make sure you stack bail money
To all my hustlers in the street, Make sure you stack bail money
And rappers in this industry, Make sure you stack bail money

[Shabazz the Disciple]
In this hip hop casino son we get the red carpet
Whoever in this game got the bank I'ma stop it
Roll the dice playa, Grab you deal and try to top it
Winner takes all, Toast bubbly when we pop it
Product aint hot think your labels gonna drop it
Industry conspiracy, Sometimes they cock block it
Put it out myself aint waste time tryna shop it
CEO money, Niggas chance the stock market
It's time to get swollie rock a rollie in a whip
And play it like Toby, All them hoes be on the strip
That's why we bag it up on that, Hustle, Nickels are wax
A CD's a twenty son, A dimes a cassette
It's all the same hustle, Fuck with my money I'm bust you
Kick in the door and let the street team rush you
You never know when you might have to catch a case
That's why I keep the brown paper bag stashed in the safe

[Chorus 2]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Judges be using bails to extort king pins
When Lieutenants turn informant then your drug ring ends
Make sure your family feeds, I hope you have wicked roots
When niggas thank you for the loot you better have the heart to shoot
I seen to many niggas get hung fuckin with legal aids
Like legal slaves that Pharaoh caught in the medieval age
Black males, Packed jails because of crack sales
They'd ask to be home now if they woulda stacked for bail
Homicide be on patrol with your photo on they lap
Got twenty five with no parole, ??? and after that
Nigga get a paid lawyer, And bail out your workers
If you let them niggas fry they gonna snitch with a purpose
Talkers catch one up in they tonsil, Or leave em horizontal
If you squeeze first I'ma haunt you
We usally clap em for that brick, Clap em if you feel funny
Keep that alibi nigga and stack bail money

[Prelude: Shabazz the Disciple]
Word, To all my niggas with the gatling under the mattress
Paper bags stashed in the safe
Never know you might catch a case, Word

[Chorus 1]</pre>
