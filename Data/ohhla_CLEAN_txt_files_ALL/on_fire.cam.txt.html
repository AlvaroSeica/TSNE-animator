[Intro Cam'ron]
Uhh Wave your hands man Yo I'm looking for a hoe
Found a hoe and the hoe ended up being a hoe
My mans Zeek always told me a hoe's gon' be a hoe let a hoe fly
Let the birds fucking fly let 'em fly right Zeek

[Zeek]
Fly away

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo Holla Yo
I need a girl that can sing like Selena, ass like Trina
Tits like Janet, get beat like Tina (Have you seen her)
I mean cake like Oprah chauffeur
Keep the toaster and a Hoster (Tell me have you seen her)
I did yeah I found one a little brown one
and she down son Plus she pushed a Beamer
I should've knew something was up from the jump
when I passed ma da blunt da bitch was a Steamer
I aint care I had weed to blow
I aint feed da hoe We took a trip to Argentina
I don't know why a guy would pause
I went raw inside the whore I thought she would be cleaner
The dirty bitch burnt me that concerned
now I'm thirsty I'm looking for her with the NINA
I'ma kill her when I see her so
(Tell me have you seen her) (Tell me have you seen her)

[Chorus 2x]
It be them girls with the pretty face and the pretty rides
Pretty thighs but what about they insides
And that bitch is a liar and dyke
I took the condom off now its on fire tonight

[Verse 2]
It's like treat her like a prostitute (prostitute)
Don't treat no girly good don't ever show her yo loot
Girly see you ridin' wanna roll in da Coupe
See you a ice cream want you to throw her a scoop
I don't get mad tell her to blow on my flute
Before the I-E you got to throw in da group groupie
Sad I read it ooh wee I'm glad you did it
Sue me what you mad I said it
Put front back side to side
Never let a broke ass female ride
I learned that down south niggaz in Texas
Before I tricked her I buy bigger Biggatses
Imagine me get a biggatses get her a Lexas
You figuring reckless maybe im sexist
So back up let me strap up
Before you give Cam that clap up I'm gone have to clack up

[Talking]

[Chorus]After Talking</pre>
