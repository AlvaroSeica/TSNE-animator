Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I don't see nothing on
When you hit that white bag
I don't see nothing on
When you hit that white bag
I don't see nothing on
When you smoke that dope bag, yeah
When you hit that white bag

Now bitch you can hear the dope, playin' with the long scope
Better not test the bag, I want all of that
Keep zippin' up the lock, serving shit, up the block
Ain't nothing wrong with smoking up when you fill the cup
Taking in front of me, I was selling to win the cup
He wanna get and rock, told em get kick rocks
Came at with the pop, same bed, jaze cop
Right on the ceil, like the colour of a Maybach
I got a little accent, holding rocks in the matrix
44 send anybody dough like it's magic
Isn't bad white, all across the a list
I smoke what I sell, I got a special packet
Drug dealer try to sell me a dirty packets
Block line hit em up, and dirty plastic
I'm a play the whole way, do you feel me?
Smokin zips all day, you feel me?
And how did it go, hit em with the scope
Stuff em in the trunk the same place and put the dope
4-4 run like the summer on the boat
Never trust the person, I keep snowing dope, Lil B

I don't see nothing on
When you hit that white bag
I don't see nothing on
When you hit that white bag
I don't see nothing on

You keep stealing my shit, I thought you wouldn't do that
You in my house, and you already knew that
You took dope bout the fridge and see you stealing my clothes
Your even stole all the courts from the down phones
You at the free market, right in the market
You a skame artist, drugs make you a target
Now you a target, who see int he fore list
You hit on the drugs that you sellin
Hurting every round around you that you cherish
Money made you sower, the fame made you jealous
Better step back
Keep this real man, the brown back, bitch you got you twerking
Never seen a nigga out here giggin
Kid licks, he never sleep in
Bad drugs you passed every weekend
That's why you dare sleepin
Lil B
You feel me?
Keep it real
I'm a keep it 100
Niggas know I'm not perfect I try to hell
The game over all it means hell hell
And they know I'm not perfect
I'm a keep it 100, I'm twerking
Just don't snip that dough bag and don't sell drugs man
Do you feel me?
Killin' the community man
I'm a keep it 100
Sometimes they know all about the money man
I don't put money over everything with me
I can't say that
I can't say that man I pout people, I put life before that
... is people over money
... people over money
I don't need that fake shit
People over money
People over money</pre>
