Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Joe Mafia]
It's all good, yo
We getting money, in the streets, in the hood, yo
And ain't thinking bout police, blowing tree smoke
Snatching ice, counting cheese, slinging dope though
Niggas fronting on me

[Joe Mafia]
Popping out of our wide, while they Hoops, Coupes and Jeeps
Don't play unless you playing for keeps, ain't nothing sweet
Niggas grinding the block, clucking, chickens along the way
On time off, waiting for cats, coming from cross the way
Going out on Now Y, for pops got it with our delay
Rocking uptown, posted on 8th, extorting yae
Hop the trains to BK, back down to VA
Ten five up to the strong, we beef in CA
Mexican mob plugs with Tihuana, baby, he
Rest in peace, got lines, respect crazily
Flinging P at me in the fam, Bam drunk
Six four and O.E.'s, when the heat run, is when the beef come
With OG's, in the hood, bubble O.T.
For this cheese, we co-d's, roll deep out Virginia Beach
In the ma Jag' we act, heard he moving ki's
Throw him in the yo, and bruise, we in the biggest six

[Chorus 2X]

[Joe Mafia]
Time water reaching over Sing Sing, red onion
Not a way, Greensville and James River, C.C.
My jail niggas, and can't make bail niggas
I wish was home, so we can break up these frail niggas
Yo, they up in blocks and used to getting it up
Once attack dumb dumbs, lump sums and never seen it coming
It was abundent, half a man, grams and had 'em sent to the stomach
You come fronting, we bucking word
Nine shot deuces and tre deuces, I thank God
I stuck with music and go hard on straight boogi
I was here when the end of no less the ninas cooly
Seen Sarafinas and cop beemers, weight like toothpicks
Rack up the cue sticks, stacks and Smiths, put a baseball
In your face, dog, get on some fool shit, it's real, nigga
You can see it in my eyes, cops is true picks
Running my raps, C4, I'm in the bricks to

[Chorus 2X]

[Joe Mafia]
For my niggas running gates when K was true to him
Who rise, rocking with J, stuck in the rear view
Q's dirty, hold tools, it's never too early
To cook cabbage, try to get package, build over hasheesh
Lit up, Jack Daniels shots of Tangeray
Drunk alcoholic, get dro then pump all day
Hit the block with beaters on, Timbs and sneakers on
The only time to leave is when the diva gone, we rolling stones
Stuck 'em in my flow to get those right, see your pal
All my niggas laid to rest, respect, they see me now
I'm in the jungle juggling, it's going down, hard and fast
One mistake and that's my ass

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
