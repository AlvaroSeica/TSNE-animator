[Big Oak]
Straight out the box it be Oak and don't expect me to choke
When I'm backed by a beat that straight rocks
I ain't no joke and I suggest you check out what I wrote
Cause I'm funkier than three day old socks
That's how I'm living, Oak catches wreck?  That's a given
I want the whole thing, not the crumbs like a pigeon
These days I'm not impressed by nothing anymore
Cause I probably seen it
Or heard it
Or done it
Or watched it
Or read about it or I heard somebody shout it
Or I listened to some gossip 'bout some cats that mighta lost it
Mind your own and worry what's behind your own door
And you can check us when we go back on tour
We're off the hook the like your phone when you're fucking
We aim our words at your dome, best be ducking
You dug your own hole that you're now stuck in
And all these dummies that keep sleeping get tucked in

[chorus]
Do what you want
Say what you want
Feel what you want
It don't matter to us

Talk all you want
Shout all you want
Doubt all you want
It don't matter to us

Repeat x 1

[Nick Fury]
I'm sick of wishin' for the good old days
My mission?
Put some fun back in the stage and shut up my own bitchin'
See I been there done it, twice times a hundred
God mad regroup while most of y'all fronted
These days I don't stay blunted by choice
I can breath a lot better standing higher Royce
And you 'betcha they won't know what to thing 'bout the
And just wait till you see me I'ma make y'all believe me
I'm an underground veteran, twenty three and better than
Ninety nine point nine percent, it's unsettling
We're underrated, while the undeserved will get un
Done, it's done, that shit is absurd, but
Actions speak louder than complaints and and claims
We're here for good so don't mistake the name
It's the L E, X I, C O, N,
It ain't even close to over, it's about to begin

[chorus]

[Nick Fury]
These days, I'm thinking things gotta change, I said
These days, I'm thinking things gotta change, I said
These days, I'm thinking things gotta change, I said
These days, I'm thinking things gotta change, I said
These days

Do what you want to
Say what you want to
Feel all you want to
To To To...

Talk all you want to
Shout all you want to
Doubt all you want to
To To To...

[Big Oak]
Yo, steppin' to the L is disastrous
[Nick Fury]
These days, the girls no longer passin' us
[Big Oak]
Went from no praise at all to miraculous
[Nick Fury]
Sooner or later they'll be naming cities after us
[Big Oak]
Better step up and come prepared if you want to try to claim a piece
Shit, as I write this I'll be thinkin' bout my next release
[Nick Fury]
The L will rock the system, ride the rhythm, standing tall
Keep talkin' madness, we'll keep ignoring y'all
