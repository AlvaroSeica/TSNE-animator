(*talking*)
Man, why would you
Not even give a effort
Let me tell you some'ing man, listen

[K-Rino]
Everybody wants to live
Looking for some love to give
You don't have to feel no shame
Cause everybody goes through pain
You just gotta live your life
Keep pushing, till you make things right
Sometimes you think that love's not real
I promise, I know how you feel
If you just believe in you
Others in your life, will too
After doing all that you can do
You remember, everyday is brand new
Never let em steal your shine
Be patient, until your time
You can have, whatever's in your mind
All you got to do is

[Chorus]
Tryyyy, try-y, try-y
You can do it man
Don't waste time, wondering why
Whyyy, try-y
You can do it girl, get up

[K-Rino]
Sometimes, people make it seem
You can never reach your dreams
The negativity they bring
Prevents you from achieving great things
Why would you ever let them in
They don't wanna see you win
They try to make you lose control
Get up, and focus on your goal
If you just believe in you
I know that God'll see you through
But only if you feel it's true
Remember everyday is brand new
The road that you was on, got rough
So then you wanted to give up
Too many ways that years gone by
Because you was afraid to

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
Ha, don't settle for getting by
The only thing that's impossible, is the thing you don't try
It's too factual to deny
The only thing that's impossible, is the thing you don't try
Don't settle for getting by
The only thing that's impossible, is the thing you don't try
It's too factual to deny
The only thing that's impossible, is the thing you don't try</pre>
