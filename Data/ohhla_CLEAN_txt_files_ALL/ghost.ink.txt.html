Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I think I'm about to go ghost, can't nobody see me
Riding round in my lokes, beamin'
You can hear the bass beating like
Coming through the speakers like

I think I'm about to go ghost, Casper on these niggas
Really ain't one to boast but I'm doing better than most
In the situation I'm in most of y'all would fumble
But I carry on on my own, I'm in the car pool alone
Doing by a hundred and ten, trying to run away from my problems
One day away from snapping, can't see no other option
And ain't nothing new to my lifestyle, can't nobody catch me right now
Engine, know you can hear me coming
Now all of a sudden I gotta make a decision
To inspire y'all to be different, who's responsibility is it?
Back then I was a nothing, what you are on my bumper for
High off that loud, but the gas never low

I think I'm about to go ghost, can't nobody see me
I'm riding round in my lokes, beamin'
You can hear the bass beating like
Coming through the speakers like

I think I'm about to go ghost, can't nobody see me
Seat to the floor, beamin'
And you can hear the bass beating like
Coming through the speakers like

I think I'm about to go ghost, riding round in my lokes
Versaces and all, black, I barely see the road
I ride for my niggas and I ride out for my folks
I know navigation, gotta stick to the code
They say once you get on you, forget where you came from
I never changed, stay the same to the grave
Coming through your speakers
Hear em talking about me, can't understand what they're speaking
Think I'm about to get low, trying rock and roll
And my eyes look like rotts, hand out the window
One hand on the roach, knee on the wheel
With my foot on the pedal just trying to keep it real

I think I'm about to go ghost, can't nobody see me
I'm riding round in my lokes, beamin'
You can hear the bass beating like
Coming through the speakers like

I think I'm about to go ghost, ain't nobody see me
See through the floor, be me
And you can hear the bass beating like
Coming through the speakers like

I think I'm about to go ghost
Riding around in my lokes
Coming through your speakers like</pre>
