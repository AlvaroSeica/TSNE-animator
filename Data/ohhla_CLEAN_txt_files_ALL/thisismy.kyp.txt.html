Song:   This is My Hit
Typed by: mack69daddy_@hotmail.com

Oh no, oh no
Well I don't know
Oh yes, oh yes it's so easy

[Verse 1]
Buck naked on a train of thoughtfulness I often hit the crossroads
Meet me at my stream of consciousness -- all flows
Get the business men out their offices
Artifice is in the air, artistry is in the air
Sicker than and AIDS patient having kemo therapy
Then a cardiac arrest -- cognac is the best drink
To make you think you're sick when you only got the sniffles
If and when you hear a record do you get the riddle?
The industry doesn't want you educated
They'd rather have a hit and a fashion statement
Fascism seems to be the only way to reach
The youth today, so shut up as I speak (Shut up, kid)

[Hook 2x]
This is my hook, this is my chorus
This is my hit -- it's better than yours

[Verse 2]
Music is a hook, a catch beat and a look
A genre that is on ya for a minute 'til you're took
There's Britney, Christina, N'Sync
Backstreet, 90 Degrees makes you think
Maybe I'm the next Eminem
But I don't wanna put a song about my mama on the radio
And Kyprios will sell the fuck out, duck out and get paid
Go mainstream -- do what's been done to get a name?
No, I ain't going out like that
See I gotta be original and an individual
Critical time to use your innermost eye
They got the money and the power and the criminal minds

[Hook 2x]

[Kyprios speaking]
Freestyle Fellowship, Gil Scott, Jill Scott, Organized Konfusion
Black Star Movement, Swollen Members, Living Legends
Sweatshop Union, De La Soul, Common Sense, Tribe Called Quest
Crash Crew, Sugar Hill, Sauks, Kardi, K-Os and to the rest
of the dopeness who don't take pay-offs

[Verse 3]
What happened to KRS-1's philosophy?
When did hip-hop become hypocrisy?
Consuming flock of sheep that's society
We need to change our media immediately
They breathing shallow words -- you gonna swallow what you heard?
Who's leading the leaders? Who follows followers?
The world is a pitch for corporate advertising
My thoughts ain't a bitch switching to commercializing
Sky is falling, the earth is erupting
Don't believe everything you hear, kid trust me
Analyze -- got a question? Ask it
Or me a market pitch for a specific demographic
Fourteen and a girl? You're the number one target in the world
Question even me gonna believe a catchy hook?
Have I got substance? I don't know, take a look
