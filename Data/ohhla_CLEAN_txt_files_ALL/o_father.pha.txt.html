Our Father, Which art in heaven
Im so grateful
Of all the beautiful things
That you are allowing me to see
Birds, Bees
The ability to do what I do
The opportunities
I know you love me now
And i think it's time
And my duty, to tell the world (jesus is my daddy I'm tellin' you, oh)

... don't let me fall
You watch for who I'm friends with
I got tattoos, you forgive me
You know I'm so sensitve
You know I'm chased by women
You know mt mind is drivin'
To you my heart is givin'...oowww

[Chorus]
You're the greatest
You're the greatest (wow wow)
you're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy I'm telling you)
Your're the greatest
Don't let me fall

They don't understand
What you do for me (do foe me)
And nothing by my actions
They don't I believe (I believe)
Not talking 'bout what I wear
When i drivin' where I sleep
I mean the ability to hear, feel and sleep

[Chorus]

Thank you for my brothers
Thank you for my daddy (daddy)</pre>
