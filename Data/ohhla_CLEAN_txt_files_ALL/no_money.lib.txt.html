Roll me tight, lick me dry
Just lace me up now let's get hi-ii-ii-igh
Hit the train, dump the ash
Now take two pulls, and pa-aa-aa-as
It's no joke it's, it's no joke in this
All day and night we smoke that c-h-r-o-ness
There's no dough on this, no 'dro in this
All day and night we smoke that c-h-r-o-ness

Goin out to my true smokes, this one's for you
Group whore tokin, got me lifted like a bulldozer
Superman mad got me floatin
Like I just smoked some shit from Simpson, again got me chokin
We be in the van rollin off that, Cheech &amp; Chong
Keep your bongs, I'm straight with the cognac Phillie
Want a hit, don't act silly
Unless you put five on the sack Willie
Smoke it with me if you got it
I smell it let me inhale it
Trendsetting, got a good roll for you
It's tight like fresh trim, all floss, no stems
Think I'll put flame to it

It's no joke it's, it's no joke in this
"Ahh Mary Jane, I'll call call you later gotta go into action"
  "Well..."</pre>
