Typed by: madass_16@hotmail.com

[Verse 1:]
Feelin' like you live in flames, everytime you think my name
Super hot and on the spot as Fly enter I dispose a lame
Never will I feel the same, for a senseless refugee
Quicka-ly get bout yo hog cause in the wind Fly must be
Now you not so cool to me, stranger changin' like the weather
Right before my eyes a big surprise is backed up by the devil
But I'm on another level, ever is Fly stayin' down
Let my pimpin' reign forever, conin' king of Funkytown
Bound to reach the highest peak, fast and pray and never sleep
Land ah Lonely I will seek cause to the top the Fly will creep
Love for me my folks will keep, deeper than the world's creation
Serve Allah and be a star, is Fly only obligation
Destination of a player, rankin' top numeric value
Give your ears a chance to hear, then I know that Fly will have you
Hotter than a block of ock, then you wish to be a friend
Kill yo hog and not me dog cause in the wind I am again

Hook: (4x)
Now I got you hot but this playa shit will never end
Sucka get back bout yo hog, let Lil Fly be in the wind

[Verse 2:]
Times are changin', suckas hangin', big and makin' more than me
Sick ah swangin', tired ah slangin', Funkytown I soon will flee
On a mission, pimp condition nigga from South Parkway
Creepin' cross the country for you lunchin' lemons pinchin' hay
Vocal killa, lyric spitter, pistol gripper, Playa Fly
Tossin' lightin' like I'm Tyson trizick take a taste of fire
Restin' in the cloudy sky, till I die Lil Fly is down
With some pimpin' psycho sound, creme of crop the top I found
Competition Playa pound, leavin' lemons layin' low
Agony of being broke, make Flizy go stang a hoe
Sober as the Holy Ghost, bringin' out no change in me
Traitors that Fly roast and toast, boastin' ain't describin' P
L-A-Y, to the A, F-L-Y, here to stay
Blunts of hay that's everyday, plus I'm sippin' Voisier
Playa Fly I know you hate, playas I appreciate
Hatas wish to desicrate, haters I eliminate

Hook(4x)

[Verse 3:]
Many niggas claimin' clout, and niggas quick to run they mouth
Trippin' testin' pimpin' but you knowin' just what I'm about
Pockets achin', suckas fakin', showin' there's a evil me
You must be mistaken if you think the best I will not be
Likin' this an' R-A-Pin', stayin' up to P-A-R
Needle in a haystack bring my hay back don't you go to far
Everything is on the bar, in Fly hood it's understood
To you lemons I'ma stop, for success I think I should
Far from bustas Playa stood, even if I stood alone
Lonesome valiant like a monk, out here on my lonely own
Totin' love from Tony Bone, plenty whoopings in my soul
Playa full ah powder showin' power leavin' bodies cold
Fly's been pimpin' Fly's been told behold the Fly a golden child
Anna wish to reconcile, but they just ain't Playa style
Psycho sounds surroundin' me, Fly can win it cannot stop
Me from reachin' T-O-P, plus I got you super hot
