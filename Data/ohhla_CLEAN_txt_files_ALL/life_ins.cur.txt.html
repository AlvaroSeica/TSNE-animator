[Curren$y]
Patty cake, patty cake, I'm baked my man
Kick it in yo streets like bad Chris in them garbage cans, aww man
Them bitches think I'm ballin' so they behavin' differently when I be in New Orleans
I'm fallin' back off 'em they crawlin' on 'em
not half-way complainin' just makin' a true statement
Which quite basically is what's missin' from this game we in
create the world in which u tryna live in kid
Some of my friends is passed away, some of my homies doin' bizz (business)
But best believe I'll bring 'em with me anywhere I is
What a hater say will never affect the way that I live
or where I go just makes me fuck they bitches in they crib
The game I got was raw and given' to in by Slim
referring to himself in the third when he on them herbs
Make sure I don't punk out in the streets but don't get too close to the curb
Jet Life too high for the birds

[Smoke DZA]
Right, big doobies rolled up you know how we do
Snow beach low like Ray Warren '92
Rugby's all flavors; lime green rod labors
to all the world gettin' paid off the talent GOD gave us
I'm parlayin', Marley's got me smack
twistin' like a Rastafari Marcus Garvey on the track and I'm faded
Niggas hated, now they all tryna get in
All the slick talk, I know ya'll ain't really mean it
Sleepin' on the kid, I hope the bed was posturepedic
Beggin' for a verse I'm like cock-sucker beat it
What ya budget like?
Go head and find a way
you tryna get in the loop I make 'em pay to ride the wave
Jet Life, it sucks to be you
Tryna get swagg, you gotta purchase this foool</pre>
