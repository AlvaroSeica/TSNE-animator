[Girl] Tell me a story, Uncle Stak
[Haystak] What you want me to tell you a story about?
[Girl] About bad guys and stuff
[Haystak] Ok, that should be easy

Check Check

Now I was, once in the mix with some phony homies
Who turned they, backs on me when I needed em most
And even though they my enemies, I'm keepin em close
Cause I can, either sink em or keep em afloat
A while the ship jumpers go searching for life preservers
I'mma stay here and try and repair the holes in my ship
Tighten the lose boards in the home that I built
I did this by myself, I didn't never need your help
Dudes are dirty, they'll try to fuck ya gal
Naw dog, you got it all wrong, I'm ya pal
Put it on his kids lives, lookin you in the eye
Knowin the whole time, he tellin a fuckin lie
My go-to guy, I could depend on you
Only people I could get me were friends like you
I know everybody out there can relate to stak, if they got stab wounds all up and down they back

I do it allll by myself
I don't neeeeed nobody else
And I'mma do fiiine without your help
I'mma do it allll by myself

Some people told me to talk to ya
Tell you don't go
I fucked up, but you should come home, though
I just couldn't fix my mouth to pronounce those syllables
While I was thinking: "Why postpone the inevitable?"
If you gon leave me, go on leave me now
There you go, baby
Kick me while I'm down
Yeah I got some issues I need to figure out
But I know one thing without a doubt
I can do this alone
All on my own, I'm grown
I gotta keep on writin songs
Get money
And maybe one day find somebody that really loves me
Stands beside me through anything
Loves my when it's sunny, the same as when it's raining
The life of Stak Mak ain't always entertaining
Would you love me if I was slanging grams on the track?
That's love and anything less than that, I'd rather be

Allll by myself
I don't neeeeed nobody else
And I'mma do fiiine without your help
I'mma do it allll by myself, yeah

Some said I was a dreamer, others told me I was stupid
I've been described as difficult, some even called me foolish
I've always had such a passion for music
There was no tellin me I wasn't destine to do this
I didn't get where I'm at by makin excuses
Cryin cause you didn't deal me no aces and dueces
I've had my heart broken and been stabbed in the back
Career endin injuries that didn't stop Stak
Rhyme after rhyme
Time and time again
It ain't all shinin and diamonds
A lot of time, a lot of grindin
A lot of beers spill in my environment
I always felt so empty surrounded by people
Felt like it was just me, you know what I mean?
A lot of work went into makin this happen
Without my people I couldn't have made it rappin

Because I couldn't have done it
Allll by myself
I needed evvvvverybody else
Wouldn'ta got doooone without your help
I couldn'ta done it alllll by myself</pre>
