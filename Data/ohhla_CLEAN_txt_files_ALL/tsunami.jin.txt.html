You got it twisted, If you think I'm here to cock block
On a bunch of  no talent wanna-be shock jocks
Nah
And they say it's all freedom of speech
Well you just lost yours, read them and weep
Wont be happy until you're fired
My peoples is pissed holmes
And I bet you not a solo miss jones
Miss who? My point exact
and tell the rest of your staff  that they need up clean up they're act
fuck the tsunami song and whoever thought of it
matter fact, fuck the engineer that recorded it
and the brains behind the scenes that applauded it
anything for ratings huh?
this shit is corporate
that little bullshit statement has gotta be, the worlds most half ass apology
thousands are still getting discovered each day
how dare you compare a life to a weeks pay
interesting, y'all quick to have a smack fest
but those that really need to ain't get slapped yet
and its rare that I'm even rapping pissed
jin is far from a human rights activist
so dont take this in a political fashion
nope its just a good old lyrical bashing
in fact I'm making it a mission of mine
wont stop till every last petition is signed
hip hop is designed to unify the masses
and we demand that you be denied the access
radio is whack, yo somebody gotta say this
same five songs on every single playlist (god)
and bad karma is the worst way to go
so I pray that god has mercy on your soul

yea
i mean you know I was gonna have something to say about this whole situation
cause for some odd reason
whenever some shit like this happens in regards to my peoples in the
society, in the media
it always manages to get swept under the rug
or end up right below the radar for some reason
like it never happened
but let it be any other race and this shit woulda been hit the fan

all my soldiers out there
its time for our voices to be heard yo
its no more of that shit
but you know I got love for everyone
whether you black, white, hispanic
that's why I love hip hop cause it bring us all together
im juss sayin
dont let it be your peoples that they dissin next time
making fun of they tradgedys just for a cheap laugh
and you sittin there like what the fuck
know what I'm saying
so keep them emails going through
keep them complaint letters goin out
keep them phones calls goin into the radio stations and the sponsers
tellin 'em how you feel
and what a fucked up move they made
let 'em know
let 'em know its about the people
and shout out to miss info too keep your head up ma
yeah
oh yeah and if all else fails
just turn the bullshit off</pre>
