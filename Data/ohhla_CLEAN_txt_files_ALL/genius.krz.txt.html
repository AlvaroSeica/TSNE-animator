[Intro - Krizz Kaliko]
Genius
A person of great and original creative ability
Of extreme talent and superior intellect
This is Genius
Chip on my

[Chorus]
Shoulder
I can't hold it in much longer
Words are gettin stronger
I'm gettin closer to you
You're close to me
So knock the chip off and we'll see

[Verse 1 - Krizz Kaliko]
Now I got a chip on my shoulder
Might as well be a boulder
I'm holdin it ?
And I got holy road of motors
Take a bite off my, right off my plate
Then I'm leavin a piece ?
? the meat with no seasoning
You can't even it out with a steam roller
I steamed over you free thrower
Sick in style is Ebola
He colder then a mouth ?
Bacardi on the rocks and Pepsi Cola
Maybe you be that ? youngta ? we older
Chip on ya shoulda when you know you're an elite soldier
Believe me, don't believe me wanna see me off
When I hit TV betta leave me on
Spit telekinesis far as it reaches
People can see I'm a beast at this
Hit the repeat and the heat don't be leavin this
Got a chip on my shoulder and I bet ya be leavin it

[Chorus]
Shoulder
I can't hold it in much longer
Words are gettin stronger
I'm gettin closer to you
You're close to me
So knock the chip off and we'll see

[Verse 2 - Krizz Kaliko]
Ay Ay!
There's a chip there (too)
Got a bear you too
While I dare you
What I say to you might scare you
The raps apostle possibly pop you
Wrassling hip-hop with a birds eye view
And I had on a mask since I was about 2
So (they're gonna laugh) at me not you
Lyrically I'm the atrium
? when ya facin them
Never mind cuz you hatin them
40 said if you do you do diligent
You could be killin em stacks you could ?pill up their philly?
Krizz I pissed in all of the cylinders
Even if we get crumbs for runs
The stadiums are still fillin up
We killin em
Anybody runnin up
The head on the snake and bat flyin mammals so nigga what
Gone dig em up
Yo favorite rappers and start feelin em again
Kali'll kill em again

[Chorus]
Shoulder
I can't hold it in much longer
Words are gettin stronger
I'm gettin closer to you
You're close to me
So knock the chip off and we'll see</pre>
