[Chorus: Sick Jacken]
Fiend when the leno gets put to the flame
Caps and 'shrooms stems to alter my brain
Drop a few tabs to make me insane
Then lose myself in a realm of strange days
My pusher helps me reach a sick domain
Sober's out of range, it's over, I've changed
Lose yourself and your name in a pile of cocaine
Slave to the drug that slugs all my pain
Pow Wow... [Echoes]
Pow Wow... [Echoes]

[Sick Jacken]
Smoke crawls through the tube of the mask, I take a blast
Faceless figure, you can't see through the clouded glass
Consuming herb gas, let loose the straps and pass
Like inked clowns we laugh
Through ancient indian rites we pow wow at night 
With bow wows take full flight
Let the peace pipe ignite insight
Spark the light then invite the right zone
Taking you on the ultimate high
Despite the legal status we find ways to have it
Some to create some simply 'cause they're addicts
Always at it like drug nymphos, burn info
Memory loss because they puff indo

[Sick Duke]
Hear the tone of my vocal chords and get stoned
On the streets I'm a drug zone, homes
Roam in you head in your psyclone
Sicko mindstate full blown
Come load up the ammo
White paper wraps indo and freaks your weed hoe
Let the smoke settle
Deep in the mind of a big time fiend and you'll see
Good and bad times
Your real life scene turns into fields of sick dreams
Using anything to get high sicko
Will you come back or remain trapped?

[Chorus]
Fiend when the leno gets put to the flame
Caps and 'shrooms stems to alter my brain
Drop a few tabs to make me insane
Then lose myself in a realm of strange days
My pusher helps me reach a sick domain
Sober's out of range, it's over, I've changed
Lose yourself and your name in a pile of cocaine
Slave to the drug that slugs all my pain
Pow Wow.. [Echoes]
Pow Wow.. [Echoes]

Lose yourself and your name in strange days like drug slaves

[Sick Duke]
Indian style, come with us red-eyed
And there will be no lies
I'm seeing visions
In the desert we were all trippin', I'm stuck
Can't see shit just the next drug hit
'Til I'm dead I'll keep my head lit
Overdoses and greedy ass loads
For those that want to walk these roads
Let the drug settle

[Sick Jacken]
I see in three dimensions no question
Cause I D.A.R.E.D. to overcome drug prevention
Tried to avoid it but I guess I was destined
For mind expansion, the kind to write text in
'Til in peace I'm resting forever getting high
'Til I get the ultimate high in heaven
But 'til then I keep myself bound to the limit
Won't O.D. unless I predict it in lyrics
And when you hear it I've overcome death and don't fear it 
I'm one who never smokes simply for gimmick
I speak it, I live it, blaze to enhance my spirit
Calm my nerves so I don't go out and smack critics
We're inked outcasts who inhale grass to get a grasp
Life's a hard task for low class
So we maintain by numbing our brain with pain killers
Some snort dust and others use vein fillers
My crew smokes chronic pillars used to chill us
As long as there's addicts the president remains the biggest dealer

[Sick Duke]
Who's your pusher, baby?
Sick dogs pushing these drugs and dicks in your guts
You get fucked
Drunk sluts act scandalous
Minds get lost and your bodies feel lust
We stay high
Just don't want to be sober, why try?
You run around in the mix of fiends trying to get re-upped 
All kinds of good drugs got you fucked up
So now you just need a fix somehow
Call up your dogs and have your pow wow</pre>
