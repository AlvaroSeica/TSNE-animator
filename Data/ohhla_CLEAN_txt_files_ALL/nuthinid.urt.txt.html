[Urthboy]
Could've played stocks bad says bank teller
Deluded shoes salesmen with a statesmens umbrella
Think of all the things that I could've put my heart into
Truth is, there's nuthin that I'd rather do

[Verse 1: Urthboy]
Because a wind will blow and a full set of ink shrouded em
Bogged up, crowded in, the cold son cowering
Like where dispair and rare hope of encountering
Or even getting through that 24 hour thing
Making monsoons out of afternoon showerings
They say 'get that cash' cause what it brings empowering
Experience enough loss you get sick of salvaging
Gotta living stargazing, daily life devoured him
But fuck that, we follow on like Laxman and Dravid
Serve it up we cut our fields, still we keep carvin it
Lot of shit went down when we were passing it
Far too easy guarding it
An Elefant never forgets a partizan
We put the art in it, that's not even the half of it
We make it marvellous, soon under the pioneers who fathered it
So whether I leave you carpeted like molts on your head
Or don't care, at least you know there's nothing false in there
yeh

[Chorus: Urthboy/Hau]
When I think of all the things that I could've put my heart into
The truth is, there's nuthin that I'd rather do, nah
There's nuthin that I'd rather do
When I think of all the things that I could've put my heart into
The truth is, there's nuthin that I'd rather do, nah
There's nuthin that I'd rather do

[Verse 2: Hau]
L-Lord let me know when I get to this f-fork in the road
What I need is one decison, god speed
Instead of me w-w-walking a slow, exhuasted and cold
Please give me strength to the tenth degree 
Give me strength to stand up, well there's no empty seats
Which path should I take
Both are big passions and I know I'm responsible for this kids action
Don't really need to be a walking man but I do need that helping hand
I got size and skill to follow my dreams of rugby
And hear the hollowing screams as fans follow the team
But I also got that knack to work deeds
Exact then rap superb to murder tracks
And I saw where my purpose at 
Now I'm here before you with my decision in a horse shoe
I say

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Muph]
Ey, who wears the pants stands out like a sore thumb
Highlighted aura moving towards the forefronts
Seduced my focus, hopeless when it's all done
All settled options called up, we can all run
Pace of the naive and my sleeve is draped in freezing rain
half-shredded couch, I can count the doubts
but they always seem to leave the lane
Etched my name across a stone cold surface
I spect on the game, I throw rocks at the circus
First thing is many sleepless nights
When it feels like you ain't really dreaming right
Try'na balance in the centre when the Jenga might 
topple in front of my eagle eyes but I legalise
Justify this addiction, this is my life and you can put it in your Discman
(Urthboy: c'mon and press play)
I wouldn't have it any other way
cause
