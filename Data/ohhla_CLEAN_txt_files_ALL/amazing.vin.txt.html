[SL-One]
It's amazing to see how far one would've come as people
It's been hard, but
Nobody else is gonna do it for us except us

[SL-One &amp; Kid Kaos]
The fact that we made it this damn far
Without too many cuts and scars
It took years to make dreams come real
Through the blood, sweat and tears
You can't stop me or hold me back
I've come too far for that
We spit raps to make the crowd react
And we love y'all for that

[SL-One]
I've been rhymin ever since I was 13 years old
Always independent, never sellin my soul
But beyond that people think it's glamour and glitz
As if we just make hits, get hoes and be rich
I must've missed that part, I haven't sought at all
My pockets still got lint, can't buy shit at the mall
But above all, life lessons learned, no drama
Gettin rid of bad karma, don't have a baby momma
I wanna teach, many of my dreams got trampled
But I maintain and I still leave my example
With ample intuition, different kind of vision
While you steady talkin I just sit back and listen

[SL-One &amp; Kid Kaos]
The fact that we made it this damn far
Without too many cuts and scars
It took years to make dreams come real
Through the blood, sweat and tears
You can't stop me or hold me back
I've come too far for that
We spit raps to make the crowd react
And we love y'all for that

[SL-One]
See, many don't get a second chance in life
Yo, I'm still on my first
Doin all this hard work till my insides hurt
I'm puttin in work, success is a long way away
But I do this for the kids that I'ma have one day
Yeah, I've started early, but it's all in the plans
Cause the seeds that I'll have gettin what I've never had
Bein dad is a role that I'm ready to play
But you're never quite prepared when it comes that day
Cut the ways of the world tryin to hold you down
Misery loves company, but I ain't stickin around
See, I've found that in this world if you really wanna last
You gotta place new trails and never walk the beaten path

[SL-One &amp; Kid Kaos]
The fact that we made it this damn far
Without too many cuts and scars
It took years to make dreams come real
Through the blood, sweat and tears
You can't stop me or hold me back
I've come too far for that

And we love y'all for that

[SL-One]
I say what I wanna say and I be who I wanna be
Cause at the end of the day it all comes down to me
What I see in the mirror is more than a reflection
It's everything I've been through and all of my decisions
Whether right or wrong, wrong or right, it doesn't matter
For the most part it really just depends on who you askin
Perception of life in the way that I see it
Is a misconstrued years, so be it
Don't heat words and take advice, all your life is already trife
No need to make the same mistake twice
It's all right if you do, though
Cause we all work on our own turns and I'ma do it too

[SL-One &amp; Kid Kaos]

And we love y'all for that</pre>
