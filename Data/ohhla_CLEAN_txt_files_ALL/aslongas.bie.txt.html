[Justin Bieber]
As long as you love me {*3X*}
I'm under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryin to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frownin
But hey now, you know girl
We both know, it's a cruel world
But I will, take my chances

[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starvin, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you looooove, love me, love me
As long as you looooove, love me, love me

[Justin Bieber]
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for the change girl
I'll be your Hova
You can be my Destiny's Child on the stinger
So don't stress, don't cry
We don't need, no wings to fly
Just take
My hand

[Chorus]

[Big Sean]
B-I-G
I don't know if this makes sense but, you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to it, I'll beat you there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple of things I can't spell without you
Now we on top of the world, cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man now we stepping out like wow (oh God) cameras point and shoot
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with
I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
it's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby true true true
But I'd rather work on this with you
than go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
As long as you love, love me, love me {*2X*}
As long as you love me</pre>
