Yeah
Beautiful condescension, my Savior came from the Heavens
Laid His head among men, redeem humanity was the intention
Some think He only came to give them all a lesson
Well if you believe that you're missing the point
Like run-on sentences
After I die we resurrecting
My family will be chilling in the sky like the Jetsons
So I bow my head for the meal, thank God for His provision
Reminded that this ain't the only bread I need for living
Boy, that sin you living isn't freedom that's prison trapped
By your own conviction reminded the clock's ticking
Or through many years of rebelling
Heart's growing cold as a blizzard, only the Gospel could melt him
So many rappers be using His name in vain
Talking how you keep it real, you kidding, what you mean?
You talking how you flipping money plus you getting green
When you laid up in that pine box, time stops it seems
You wanna live fast, die young, you dummy
Live wise, die ready, whenever the moment comes
The power of life and death reside in the tongue
So we usin' every breath to lift up the name of the Son

I came to lift Him on high
And can't nobody tell me different
And if faith come in through hearing
Well I hope all of y'all listen up

I came to lift Him on high
And can't nobody tell me different
And if faith come in through hearing
Well I hope all of y'all listen

I'm going back in, this is round number two, found in the truth
Drinking living water like the fountain of youth
Forever young I live eternal, people are gon' burn you
When they do tell me who you turn to
Living horizontal, look vertical
Men hold on, eyes forward, stand tall, no urinal
Man is a servant who died to himself
Put his pride in a funeral, bet he be with no tombstone
I speak the truth, but y'all don't wanna listen
There're souls to be won, so I say let's go get 'em
Ain't talkin' 'bout cards when I say I go fishin'
I still hate religion, why you think I'm a Christian
They wanna know the difference
The peace between God's been broke for my sinning
Religion is man using his good deeds tryin' to close the distance
But we could never reach Him
Only Jesus came to get His men
Now

I came to lift Him on high
And can't nobody tell me different
And if faith come in through hearing
Well I hope all of y'all listen up

I came to lift Him on high
And can't nobody tell me different
And if faith come in through hearing
Well I hope all of y'all listen

Woo, yeah
