[Master P]
How you do that there
New Orleans, Baton Rouge, how you do that there
Lafeyette, Lake Charles, how you do that there
Shreveport, Mississippi, how you do that there
Alabama, Atlanta, how you do that there
Florida, Arkansas, how you do that there

[Verse 1: Young Bleed]
I hear they say, "who that?"
Say they wanna do that
I hit ya buck jumped and hollin' 'bout "I should've knew that"
Smokin' my herb, fresh out the curb, jelly jam and preserve
Nothing but balls and my word, and a mossburg
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Whatever, however, cause young fools still down
Hollin' bout
"Huh, say what"
Huh, you can play, but say what
Full of that {*weed*}
Planted like a poppy seed
A slanted and enchanted young hustler named Young Bleed, party on
In the jungle, where the murder million mumble
For months and days, trippin' off the blunts we blaze
Hell of a high, and tellin' 'em why
I'm a never say die, you can see it my eyes, gettin' high
They say I Fly Like A Eagle, I see no, evil, ah
And ain't no sequel to this here
This year, I'm bailin' in the door, supernatural
Wicked, y'all fools don't here me though
But see how they runnin' everything on the cool
But I'm fin' to act a fool and you know that there

Chorus 1:
[Bleed]    I got 'em hollin', "How you do that there"
[Master P] From Texas to Kansas, players, we don't care
[Bleed]    Thugs holla, "How you do that there"
[Master P] From Missouri to Ohio, players, we don't care
[Bleed]    Hustlers holla, "How you do that there"
[Master P] D.C. to tha Valley, players, we don't care
[Bleed]    Players holla, "How you do that there"
[Master P] Cali to Virginia, players, we don't care

[Verse 2: Master P]
See in these streets, anything goes
My cousin in the pen hittin' that iron, gettin' swoll
Sent me a letter said, "P, get your paper"
Don't trust these winches, these fools, they'll take ya
Hustlin' just a habit, young bred in cabbage
Popcorn and grits, I'm tryin' to get a rabbit
What about a, nice stallion to slide in
Twenty inch Vogues with some candy paint to ride in
Homeys flip change in the game cause we soldiers
Eyes yellow red cause a G blowin' doja
Tie the black shoe strains tight on the Reeboks
Grab the ski mask, DKNY, I mean a plastic glock
Girls 'bout that mmhh, fools get dealt with
Keep your enemy tight, G's can never thank quick
Pour out some liquor to the homeys that are gone
R.I.P. to every real rapper that is gone
Players, if you 'bout it, scream and you shout it
It ain't where you from, every soldier get rowdy
Game get real, see, guard your grill {*anvil bang*}
Cause in this wicked ghetto, you could lose your life
For a dollar bill

Chorus 2:
[Bleed]    I got 'em hollin', "How you do that there"
[Master P] Kentucky to Tennessee, we don't care
[Bleed]    Thugs holla, "How you do that there"
[Master P] North Carolina, South Carolina, fool, we don't care
[Bleed]    Hustlers holla, "How you do that there"
[Master P] Arkan' to Utah, we don't care
[Bleed]    Players holla, "How you do that there"
[Master P] Arizona to New Mexico, we don't care

[Verse 3: C-Loc]
It's wicked, when I kick it wicked, you don't hear me though
When I hit the door, just hit the floor, time to go
Play the cost to be the boss, in this rappin'
About as wicked as it's gon' get
In the industry, I be
Bringin' the action, in this musical fashion
If you don't know fool, you better ask 'em
Cause fools that wanna get with, I get with em
When I put my gloves on, I'm 'bout to get 'em gone, so long
Please mama, may I, go out and be a player
Sippin' on Hennessey, a million women want me
My boy passed the herb, I took a toke, I'm stayin' true
Cause whatev' he down with, I'm down with it, too
So don't get full of that alcohol
In the club and thank you bad
Cause if y'all clowns start actin' up
Some 'bout to go and whoop yo (Oooh!)
Now who's that makin' that funky noise
It's the Locster comin' through, with all his boys
Messed up and let me get the right place in time
So now fools, I'm goin' for mine
Ugh

Chorus 3:
[Bleed]    I got 'em hollin', "How you do that there"
[Master P] From New York to Oklahoma, players, we don't care
[Bleed]    Thugs holla, "How you do that there"
[Master P] Minnesota to Michigan, we don't care
[Bleed]    Hustlers holla, "How you do that there"
[Master P] Illinois to Indiana, players, we don't care
[Bleed]    Players holla, "How you do that there"
[Master P] Cause TRU players 'bout it and we don't care

[Master P]
How we do that there, uh
Uh, how we do that there, uh
How we do that there
Cause No Limit Soldiers 'bout it and we don't care
Uh</pre>
