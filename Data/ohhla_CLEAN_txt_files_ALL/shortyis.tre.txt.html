If she fine, if shawty is a dime
You should tip her, you should tip her
If she go, and you love her
You should tip her, you should tip her
If she fix you eggs and grits in the morning
You should tip her, you should tip her
Pancakes with the bacon on the side
(You should tip me, you should tip me)
Shawty rock to the beat for ya boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rock to the beat for ya boy
Now to see you at 23 all I can say is
