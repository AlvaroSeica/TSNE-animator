[KRS-One]
We gonna take it to the back of your brain (tell 'em!)
We put it on the side of a train (tell 'em!)
We gonna make it so simple and plain
Revolutionary people, yo this ain't a game! (tell 'em!)

How many y'all really ready for change? (tell 'em!)
Or do you really want to keep it the same? (tell 'em!)
Edutainment - this the reason I came
If you down for the struggle, yo remember these names

Malcolm X (Whachanoabout)

If you really want to change the game
Take a little time and study these names

If you want injustice to end
Take a little time and study these men

Marcus Garvey (Whachanoabout)
Nat Turner (Whachanoabout)

Let me tell you about the struggle my friend (tell 'em!)
We want freedom, I'ma say it again (tell 'em!)
We want freedom, not more money to spend (tell 'em!)
You got to listen to this message I send, come on!

Let me talk to you a little bit more
Our ancestors, tell me, what you dissin' 'em for?
Break the cylce of first I like, then I don't like
You raise and praise me up to tear me down like Michael ???
KRS loves his people
I walk with my people, not above my people
Teach my people, I try to reach my people
With real truth, evidence and real proof

We gonna take it to the back of your brain (tell 'em!)
We put it on the side of a train (tell 'em!)
We gonna make it so simple and plain
Revolutionary people, yo this ain't a game! (tell 'em!)

How many y'all really ready for change? (tell 'em!)
Or do you really want to keep it the same? (tell 'em!)
Edutainment - this the reason I came
If you down for the struggle, just remember these names
Remember these names, remember these names, remember these names! Rock!

"Africans in America burned down over 290 cities in the '60's
 to get 289 powerless mayors in the '80's"

What you really want to debate me for?
What you hate me for? What you take me for?
Always sayin' "Amen" and "As-Salamu `Alaykum" for
If I can't speak my mind, even if it may be raw
New ideas is what they pay me for, but here's an old one
The Feds(?) are gonna save us, sure 
Since '89 I be coming again, with peace, love, and unity
Remember these men
