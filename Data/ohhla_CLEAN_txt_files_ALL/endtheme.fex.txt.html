[Yahzarah]
Looking over the horizon
There's the end of the beginning
So salute the sun and move on, move on
Just the beginning of another ending
Not enough time to say goodbye for now
So I'll just sit and salute the sun and run on, run on
The times like this when I look inside
and feel so connected to you, so connected to you
I wouldn't change a thing, just would be happy to
live and love and be so connected to you, connected to you
So connected to you, connected to you</pre>
