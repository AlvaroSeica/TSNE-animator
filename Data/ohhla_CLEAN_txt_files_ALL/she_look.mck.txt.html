Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Yeah, don't act because you can't stop it
Your woman and jump out a pocket
Looking at my rings and my watches
She so off the chain, somebody call to locksmith
Shit, that your girl you better get er mane
Before I leave I'm just motherfuckin with er mane
One minute I was kissing taking pictures mane
Next she forgot that she was even with your man, damn
Y'all was a cute couple
Just because I hit that don't mean that she don't love you
Hate to bring trouble to your world
But the height spit it quick, duffle bag your girl
I didn't even try, but she was in the club fucking me with her eyes
I get her to the crib, she fucking me in my...
She ain't gonna leave, til me and my niggas tired

[Chorus]
Yeah, she must like something I'm doing
She having thoughts of us screwing
She got a boyfriend, she ridin next to him
But every time he turn his back she lookin'
Every time he turn his back she lookin'
Every time he turn his back she lookin'
Every time he turn his back she lookin'
Every time he turn his back she lookin'

[Verse 2]
Chyeah, boo snatcher, happy home breaker upper
Home boy I make life tougher
For Simpson, fake pimps and handcuffers
Type of niggas that smashed once and say they love her
Haha, I laugh at y'all
Go ahead and wife the freak I ain't mad at ya'll
See I don't know if you ain't hell in your bills
But if looks was sex, me and your girl done had some kids
And no, this ain't a joke, and no this ain't a riddle
But homie look you getting played something like a fiddle
Bet your man can't do it like this ah ah
We can't work the middle cause this thing too little
You see, I've been diagnosed with Realnigganittis
And no I ain't the Spartan but she call me Leonidas
It's funny how I used to just chill on Lee Anders
My first girlfriend see her first name was Candace
We used to chill and play the cut like a praying mantis
But you know how love go, it don't go how you planned it
She used to love me high, she used to love me sober
Now she probably somewhere with a counterfeit Casanova
Damn, haha, you could've had a Mack, baby girl
Oh Casanova!
Yea spitter bring the hook in, let's go!

[Chorus]
Yeah, she must like something I'm doing
She having thoughts of us screwing
She got a boyfriend, she ridin next to him
But every time he turn his back she lookin'
Every time he turn his back she lookin'
Every time he turn his back she lookin'
Every time he turn his back she lookin'
Every time he turn his back she lookin'</pre>
