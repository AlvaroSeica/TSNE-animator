[Gees Extortion]
Yo, yeah, yeah... Gees!
Extortion {*whispered*}
Make way, make way - here I come

Soon as I step in the booth, the mic I clutch
When Extortion start flowin the mic might bust
Try your luck muh'fucker you might get crushed
Act tough on my block and you might get rushed
Verbs, antonyms, nouns, synonyms
Herbs can't handle 'em, words just be killin 'em
I know you the feelin them, James Bond flow
PP7 on the low; lyrical double oh
You never find another rhymer flow like this
Gees but y'all would think I was "the soloist"
Just +Follow the Leader+, I can make ducks clap to this
+Microphone Fiend+, tearin up the map with this

[Chorus: Rakim samples]
The rough gets goin, the goin gets rough
When I start flowin the mic might bust {*2X*}
When I start flowin, when I start flowin
The rough gets goin, the goin gets rough
When I start flowin the mic might bust {*2X*}
When I start flowin, when I start flowin
So make way, cause here I come

[Gees Extortion]
Yo I'm comin through the door (yeah) I said it before
Why I never hear real rap music any more?
Wordplay, on point, sharp, feel it penetrate
Punctuatin bars through the mic, it might detonate
Make way nigga, here I come
Best believe I got somethin for these queer rap bums
Yo on the real, 'bout to start exposin rap frauds
Sick and tired of these sweet rappers spittin them candy bars
You can't see me; my style microscopic
The mic I never drop it, y'all niggaz better stop it (just stop it)
Booth bandit, y'all phonies can't stand it
How you gon' want beef if there's balogna in your sandwich?
(Hahaha~!) Y'all niggaz full of it, about to do the hood with it
Rhyme is tight, bustin is nothin, I'm mic bustin
We can go line for line, bar for bar
Song for song, dead wrong, bustin down Death Star

[Chorus]

[Gees Extortion]
Yo; y'all can't fuck with it, I get a little rough with it
Bulldog muzzle it, slugs you can guzzle it (take that)
I got so many verbal guns up in my arsenal
I'm the #1 contender, you don't wanna spar with Duke
Booth meltdown, arson, arsonist
Gees Extortionist, fearsome with the flow and shit
Funny thing about is that I'm not even forcin it
I'm so sick, I can make Oscar the Grouch nauseous
Vocab flawless, caution be cautious
You do it big? Well we do it enormous
I'm better with the dictionary, nicer with thesaurus
That's word to my son I put it on my daughter
G-double-E nigga S stands for slaughter
I done seen the toughest cat get snuffed
So it's nothin it's a must that I drop these trucks
The rough get goin, the goin get rough nigga

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
