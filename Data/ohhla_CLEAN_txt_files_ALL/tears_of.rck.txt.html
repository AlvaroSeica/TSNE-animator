*[Rick Ross - VERSE 1]*
Smoking the best spliff in a brand new Benz
No ID on the track let the story begin. begin...
Lookin in the mirror but I don't see much
Staring in the streets so I don't sleep much
Watching the snakes so they don't creep up
But the way I'm gettin dis money niggaz cant keep up
U niggaz cant keep up
Niggaz got beef but it cant be much
I'm still walking through the crowds like I cant be touched
Top back all black Gretzky puck
Ice skater little later might let me fuck
Damn, she might let me fuck
Last night I cried tears of joy
Wat did I do to deserve this
Vacheron on my wrist a year ago
I didn't even know that bitches exist
Quarter milli for the motherfucker
No insurance on a motherfucker
Ain't life a bitch, but you gotta keep her wet
Keys open doors so I gotta keep a set
Everybody knows I'ma a lot of people's threats
Biggie smalls in the flesh living life after my death
Yesterday I read my horoscope
Tell me lord will I be poor and broke
Tell me lord will I be dealing dope
I wanna take my momma to the pocanoes

*[Chorus:]*
Why
But only lords knows
To all the love ones I leave behind
Because they cant see me fine
N I ask when sum1 wants 2 b me y??
Not even everything can ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My god I'm scarred
I have tattoo tears of joy

*[Rick Ross - VERSE 2]*
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this
Young rich motherfucker still uneducated but dammit a nigga made it
GOD damn a nigga made it cremated in the church lord knows I'm blessed
5 different lawyers so you know I'm stressed
A punch in the face get you 300k
Ask glad now he back making minimum wage
Another victim of my criminal ways
I wanna walk in the image of Christ
But that bitch vivica nice
And I'm still swimming in ice
I'm just living my life
I'm just living my life
Lease a Lamborghini for your pussy rate
Life is just a pussy race
Snatch a bitch take her back to your place
Next mourning I can tell you how the pussy taste
I got expensive taste

*[Chorus]*

*[Rick Ross - VERSE 3]*
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did we do to deserve this
Not to dwell on the the past but to keep it real I gotta represent for M &amp; Teel
All the dead souls in the field
Lookin at my rolly its about that time
White man had a problem wit mine
And we suppose 2 be shy? (shy, shy)
The revolution still applies
Probably still on the rise

*[Chorus]*</pre>
