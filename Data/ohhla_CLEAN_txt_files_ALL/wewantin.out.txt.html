One go got it in your mouth (we get it out your club)
All I need is sum fire N dem plastic (in them sum)
I'm already on fire
Don't pass me no lighta
E.D heat it up
All I need is a beat like this
And then I'm gon eat it up
Time taker so we gettin to da chips
22 on da charger but I'm wishin 26
Yea I'm blessed but ma belly want more (more)
Makaveli in ma dream sayin "nigga get your doe" (doe)

Da protocol plans bout strategise to rise
And know u gon' ball i'm still spendin money

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
One that i chose is few i always
Do what i'm supposed to do
Count on me, down by 3 to always come through
When the, pressure is on, the weather is storm
Shoot up whole blocks and obstacles they set before us
It's time ta fast forward the time the future is now
Hate my flow u bitch still love my style
Born weed up in the concrete i'm claiming my spot
U gon hav to take my life u wanna take wat i got
I was the outlaw before i started to ride with Pac
Ride around third grade i started to rise with Yak
Youngin thuggin what's fuckin with us?? Nuthin
I refuse to lose and do songs with no substance it's nobudget
I represent some special, respectful!
Its the outlawz shit, just a whole another level
It's more than just rhyming when your music is timeless
Like mine is besides just we outlawz rise
Yeah!

We Want In!

[Verse 3: Stormey Coleman]
It's money over bitches
My nigga fuck every thang
Every hood, every block
Every ghetto with every gang
Throw your hood up
Keep on grindin, and get paper
Love for the real, and death to the fakers
On a meal-ticket mission
All i see is get more
Need a hater shit to leave
Nigga havta find dough
We get money over
(Spendin money over here)
Yeah, Pac and Yak gone but nigga we still here
I done seen too many niggaz die to feedin shit
And i aint playin what i confessed i die bout this
It's God's plan it's our time now its our stand
Aint no thug nigga breathin a thug like we can
Our fan make no friend till we beleive for this shit
5 minds but we the realist niggaz doin their shit
If i can't make money which is like 50, fuck u bitch
I mean that shit, i need my split
