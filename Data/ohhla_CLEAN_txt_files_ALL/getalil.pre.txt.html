Lick it from the front hit ya from the back
Freak you in my whip baby just relax
Lick it from the front hit ya from the back
Freak you in my whip baby just relax

Can we get a little closer baby?
I wanna get to know you lady
Me and you, it's like night and day (like night and day)
Cause you seem so far away shawty
Can we get a little closer baby?
I wanna get to know you lady
Me and you, it's like night and day (like night and day)
Cause you seem so far away shawty

[Baby Blue]
Count my paper stack my weight up
She's a gold digger, but I ain't gone hate her
I'd still date her cut her like a brand new razor
Fine like some old wine in the 'fridgerator
too much flavor
Sweeter than nowalaters
hook her then bait her, recieve her like the raiders
I'm that player, I'm that balla, regulate her, crushin' haters
in the baby blue gators

[Spectacular]
Now foxy thang come closer I wanna gets to know ya
got some tricks up my sleeve I really wanna show ya'
caressin and holdin ya, kissin ya toes and uh
openin doe's fa ya and walkin in the cold for ya
what else I gotta do just to make your body mine
cuz god damn ya fine and I wanna spend time.
I ain't lyin'
I wanna whisper in ya ear like a singer
I'm a pro player call me Wayne ha Zane

Can we get a little closer baby?
I wanna get to know you lady
Me and you, it's like night and day (like night and day)
Cause you seem so far away shawty
Can we get a little closer baby?
I wanna get to know you lady
Me and you, it's like night and day (like night and day)
Cause you seem so far away shawty

Lick it from the front hit ya from the back
Freak you in my whip baby just relax
Lick it from the front hit ya from the back
Freak you in my whip baby just relax

I really wanna lay you down when I touch down in your town
Baby let me break you off (oh baby)
I really wanna lay you down when I touch down in your town
Baby let me break you off

[Slick 'Em]
Now only I scratch nipple but I don't bite
got me paralyzed off your sexy hips and your thighs
and like ooh gasolina wanna jump on your trampolina
got them bombinas in the winner
mama come her now I wanna spend the night
I make the crowd go wild like Holyfield won the fight
you my dynasty how you roc-the-fella world.
Plus you from the projects you remind me of my poor little rich girl
Now baby girl come closer (closer)
I got some thangs I wanna show ya (show ya)
Now baby girl come closer (closer)
I got some thangs I wanna show ya..

Can we get a little closer baby?
I wanna get to know you lady
Me and you, it's like night and day (like night and day)
Cause you seem so far away shawty
Can we get a little closer baby?
I wanna get to know you lady
Me and you, it's like night and day (like night and day)
Cause you seem so far away shawty

Lick it from the front hit ya from the back
Freak you in my whip baby just relax
Lick it from the front hit ya from the back
Freak you in my whip baby just relax

I really wanna lay you down when I touch down in your town
Baby let me break you off (oh baby)
I really wanna lay you down when I touch down in your town
Baby let me break you off</pre>
