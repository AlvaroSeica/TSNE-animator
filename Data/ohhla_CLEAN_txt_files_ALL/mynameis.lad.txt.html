[La the Darkman]
Yo, nigga, my name is important, just check what I'm sporting
Gray jewels, white tee, and the Carolina Jordans
Gold flipping, gat gripping, triple beam, scale tipping
All my Blood niggas dogging, all my Crip niggas cripping
And my pimp niggas pimping, I'm a certified hustler
Nigga try and play with my paper, and I'mma bust ya
No arm, no leg, put a bullet in yo head
Turn you into a vegetable, nigga, if you ain't dead
Boy, let me catch you slipping, best believe I'mma feast
Like them niggas in Chicago, took that G-Unit piece
Get it right, my click tight, from the hood to the Bing
And my arms stretch from the Brook to Sing-Sing
I get a nigga peeled, cuz it's a normal thing
All my knives and my guns is long as Yao Ming
And we come for a nigga like American Marines
Mister Bush, is our leader, told us go and get the cream
For that oil, I'mma fiend, understand the similarities
My pants had holes, shoes used to be raggedy
Now I got VVS diamonds with nice clarity
Every broad I fuck, screaming she wanna marry me
It's sickening, sometimes I really act like I'm listening
While I'm really planning how to get these bricks in Michigan
Twenty for a piece, I get 'em for sixteen
Make eight, off each, do the math, knawimean?
Then slide with the green, now I'm back, O.T.
Put that cash in the safe, where it's supposed to be
And I don't buy shit, I'm more like a hermit
Play the crib, with a bad broad, slobbing my dick
Fifty six inch plasma TV, where I sit
Monday Night Football, watching Ray Lewis hit
John Madden talking shit, while I'm rolling a spliff
And you know I got that chronic, you smell it before it's lit
Holmes, I used to be broke, right now, I'm fixed
Guns all around my house, with different size clips
When I'm out, you see me in, different sized whips
Got a hooptie, a Land, a beemer and a six
Shorty, I can't be your man, but you, could be my bitch
Show you how to mule coke, shoot guns, and get rich, young La</pre>
