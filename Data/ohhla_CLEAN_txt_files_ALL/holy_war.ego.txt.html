[Sir Ibu]
Ahh yeah.. one two in the place to be..
On the M-I-C is me Sir Ibu of the D-F-C
And I get bu-sy..
In front of me on the one and two
you have the Ji-za, cut provider, just doin the do
Also in the house you have Melquan and Jazzy G
And this is "Holy War," and I get busy like this
Let's walk this dog Ji-za

Supreme wisdom, is what I give 'em
Dressed to kill - is how I'm livin!
I'm Sir I, the God on the microphone
Let me show you why the stage is my throne
Intelligent - individual with intellect
Watch me pick up the microphone and wreck
you, you, and your homeboys too
Your gay posse group or the, whole damn crew
I'll do it casual, I'll come classical
Let's be rational - it's all actual
The laws of nature, allows me to do this
So do the knowledge, and watch me just prove this
Yeah makin records, is what I am makin
Guinness Book of Records, is what I am breakin
My energy is flowin and it's causin sparks and friction
I am called the scientist and you are science-fiction
So just listen to the lights that I'm shinin
The wisdom that I'm speakin are the words that are rhymin
The Gods of Rhyme, Divine Force gets busy
Make you hip or hop or get dizzy
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle
Scream shout or laugh or just giggle
That body, party that body
Don't {fuck} with me, you'll feel sorry
That's word, I'm not the herb
Understand what I'm sayin?  Observe
The power and strength Divine Force is pushin
All the faces Divine Force is mushin
There now, you see that's why I'm Sir I
Supreme Eye-C, The Ji-za, you can die - HOLY WAR!!

KnowhatI'msayin?  Just do it ery'day
Routine, that's how we get busy
I get busy - ain't a small thang
Yo, but this battle just began
and we gon' win this war so Ji-za let's walk this dog

Time flows constantly the way time flows
Twenty-four oh-seven, Sir I shows
outstanding competition, the greatness of my triumph
My techniques are invincible so why even try 'em?
Try 'em, I am, rewarding myself
for this funky fresh masterpiece you put on the shelf
However, suckers, the topic is the victory
You wanna be victorious?  You have to know y'all history
Science mathematics, literature the blessin
History is great, but defeat is the lesson
Yes and how dare you - biting's even worser
Time invested into this - bite it and I'll hurt you
in the battle, of wits, the great against the greatest
I'm a genius, at heart, you know, that's why I say this
I feel the power bein better than someone
Find a new kind of sport, let me tell you how I won son
I'm tryin, to help, not dismiss this the
doctor lawyer politician judge brother sister
So listen to me people I won't break, I'm flexible
Sir I so fly no lie, that's not edible
Damn my man come back, where are you goin?
This is the part where Ibu starts showin
youthful rap on wax that's like magical
Never can be wack or lack or act radical
As I grow I flow with versatility
Stick to this beat and practice my agility
That's why I didn't pause, on this beat at all
Notice my style has changed y'all
No that was expected, for years you have neglected
This is my style so you might as well accept it
Now or never, not tomorrow or later
With mics or guns we can see who is greater
I'm a warrior - from Medina, that is Brooklyn
If you EVER try to diss me WORD IS BOND your head is tooken
I done killed devils, mutilated snakes
Shot my own brother cause he called me a fake
cause I'm a maniac, a murderer, crazy!
Is that the case?  Then why do they praise me?
My loved ones, my girlfriend, my family
This part of me believe me you'll never see again
friend, enemy cause then
you have to forgive, for this here sins
But mom, I'm tired, and fed of their bull{shit}
So let's get the vests, the uzis and do {shit}
That's right dad I'm at the point I don't give a {fuck}
Bring (?) some grenades and let's BLOW 'EM UP!!

Ahh yeah, Holy War!
Get busy..
PEACE!!</pre>
