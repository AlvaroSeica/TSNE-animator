Uh
All hail king Bibby
Youngin from the block but do this shit for my city
I can't trust a soul so I keep the 9 wit me
Riding sober than a bitch you know herb off wit me
And we work hard, can't take no time off
Can't turn my grind off, I think my mind lost
I'm the best you know my rhymes cold
So nigga talk shit gon let the 9 off
Get to bustin watch them niggas get to runnin
No limit in the place and they know we get it bustin
Young nigga shit on my young nigga shit
50 deep turnt up hella guns in this bitch
I'm feelin grown man polo sag on the cohans
My whip foreign and I might just put 4's on
I'm rockin purple label I know you ain't got those on
Get up in the booth and turn ape like gohan
Go hard till I pass out, Bibby I be swagged out
Yellow nigga case I find a stain I brought the mask out
Dico brought the mag out, tina brought the cash out
I'm yelling brief pack the fiends thought I had a pass out
I smoke I ring eyes blood red, no visine
Bibby go hard do it for my team
Nigga you a customer and Ima give it to em gotta serve my fans
Kush strong but never mind me, and if you need something gotta run it by me
President like joey i.e and I get in this bitch wit no id
I'm higher than a spaceship this that outta state shit
That 4 4 that long nose thats pippen
Ball hard blake griffin, that pour up I'm sippin
Pop a molly I'm trippin, got a bad bitch she strippin
She giving free head cuz my name ranked cuz I sure ain't tippin
All this money I'm getting, I move weight no fitness
I'm so ridiculous, no weatherman could predict this
See I told my wrist this, got me feeling so rocky
I get get my dick licked, that foreign thing a stick shift
Savage squad don't have a broad my young niggas they wit it
I pull up my trunk loud on 28's I'm in it
We come through got guns too out the sun roof like I did it, uh
When I spit raps make em think 2Pac back I must be a descendant
Smoking loud no midget, fuck a deal I'm chillin
Bitch I need 8 digits, period, put me in the game and I'm killin</pre>
