[Kung Fu movie sample]
The Lin Brotherz are skilled with darts, can fight the 3rd

[Cilvaringz]
The abbott signed mastermind behind the bloody savage
Ray Van Barnefield darts strictly damage
United swordsmen, we ordering the slaughtering
Caught up in the bloodbaths, represent the wind-staff
On Christ sandels, stamp foot on the Ringz Raft
Peace to the Wu-Tang Clan, you understand?
I murder contradictors who be fucking with my niggaz
Even if they raise the white flags and prove innocence
They get dragged in the Pit of Snakes
Stomped out for a month or 8 and then slain
And slit from their dick to their brain
Gravitate the blade and carve the Lin Brother names
There's no other motherfucker that be running things
The 36th Chamber is my only residence,
Swordsferatu, incinerate the bodies in the river near the Wu-villa
Destruct the liver using five rings of silver
Born to shed blood for my family with pride
The silent will survive my genocide
I never lie to the righteous, I'm never violent
My Co-Defendant is a tiger with dragon burns
Fighting duels as my saga continues
Never surrender, call me Wu-Nitanyahou
Shoooo! Dead,
We form like Voltron and chop off your head
It's Wu-Tang, slang, crack your spine
My understanding navigates the dumb, deaf and blind
Motherfuck time, reminds me of nonsense
Lin Shadowboxers, Razor blade's my cartridge
Obligate your slaves to my chamber of bondage
Signing off, Cilvaringz the holy prince of darkness

[Chorus: Cilvaringz]
Enter the chambers of the Lin Brotherz, what?
This be the Shaolin Sword stained with the Royal blood
Taste the blades we be swinging, throw your sword up
Feel the pain of the golden martial darts, God
Enter the chambers of the Lin Brotherz, what?
This be the Shaolin Sword stained with the Royal blood
Taste the blades we be swinging, throw your sword up
Feel the pain of the Swordzferatu, martial darts

[Baracuda]
Severe punishment, dragon dungeon pit
Descend from heaven, as written in the first testament
I helped build the pyramids, stones were thrown as a sign of intelligence
Emperors sat on their throne next to the men of medicine
Eating grapes, drinking wine
My physical birth was the sign of the times
All the suns of different solar systems provided
a shine that left Mary blind
Made the holy men cry, though it was prophesized
by the archangel, Gabriel, God's messenger, at the table
I still gave the bread to Juddha, they crucified the Barrakjudah
I resurrect, like Lazarus, I'm swinging talons
Stabbing savages with daggers in a state of madness
I practice, rage, seeking slaves
On stage, in crowds, molest 'em in a cage
Supreme being, standing in the coliseum
Fighting lions and panthers with bare hands for the word of freedom
Arena of blood, near the mountain of God
A sacred place where holy wars were being fought
I spit poems in the roman catacombs
Skeleton bones get walked on, by the army of darkness
The forefathers, who passed their knowledge on to the Lin Brotherz

[Chorus]

[Outro: Cilvaringz]
Moongod Allah, Swordzferatu martial darts
Lin Brother, we the Gods

[Kung Fu sample]
You two brothers always fight together
Who cares to fight with us?
