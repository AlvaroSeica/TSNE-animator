[Intro: Chief Keef]
I Love All My Fans, Without Ya'll I Wouldn't Get Famous
Da da da da eh, These Niggas Fuck with My Campaign
These Bitches Know My Name

[Chorus]
I know I'm finally rich, but ain't a damn thang gon' change
Me and my boys still bang
We'll clap a nigga up no range
Bitch I'm Finally Rich
I could ride foreign cars, I love all my fans, without ya'll I wouldn't get far
Bitch I'm Finally Rich
I smoke all the dope, I get so high just see the scope, Real nigga from the O
Bitch I'm Finally Rich
And you ain't the same, All These Niggas Follow my Campaign
Now these Bitches Know My Name
Bitch I'm Finally Rich

[Chief Keef]
I'm a show you how to ball, first you walk up in the mall
hit every store and buy it all, cause it ain't shit
I be flexing on these lames, I'm a O-Block nigga can't change
64th street my domain, savages
So I gotta take care of my squad, for every fucking body
get robbed, from they Night job and day job, That's why I got rich
So I take care of my mom, take care of my daughter, and take care of my brothers
But I'm finally rich
So just watch Sosa stack this chedda
Flexing on these niggas no better, hate on me it don't matter
So just watch Sosa stack this chedda
Flexing on these niggas no better, hate on me it don't matter

[Chorus]
I know I'm finally rich, but ain't a damn thang gon' change
Me and my boys still bang
We'll clap a nigga up no range
Bitch I'm Finally Rich
I could ride foreign cars, I love all my fans, without ya'll I wouldn't get far
Bitch I'm Finally Rich
I smoke all the dope, I get so high just see the scope, Real nigga from the O
Bitch I'm Finally Rich
And you ain't the same, All These Niggas Follow My Campaign
Now these Bitches Know My Name
Bitch I'm Finally Rich

[Chief Keef]
I be flexing with my big bros, reese money and fredo
We got big bands full of bank rolls, bitch we rich
Yeah I get 20 for a show
I ain't worried bout no hoe
Cause I switch those like I switch clothes
Bitch I'm rich
Every bitch knows chief keef, every bitch want Chief Keef
all these bitches jump chief keef, finally rich
I got diamonds all on my watch, horses all in my car, I get 10 bands for a 8 bar

[Chorus]
I know I'm finally rich, but ain't a damn thang gon' change
Me and my boys still bang
We'll clap a nigga up no range
Bitch I'm Finally Rich
I could ride foreign cars, I love all my fans, without ya'll I wouldn't get far
Bitch I'm Finally Rich
I smoke all the dope, I get so high just see the scope, Real nigga from the O
Bitch I'm Finally Rich
And you ain't the same, All These Niggas Follow My Campaign
Now these Bitches Know My Name
Bitch I'm Finally Rich</pre>
