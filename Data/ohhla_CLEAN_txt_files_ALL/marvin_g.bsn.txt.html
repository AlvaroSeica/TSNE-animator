[Intro - Kanye West]
Yeah, you know a nigga don't really wanna take his cool off, uh
(Big Sean: Boi! do it) 

[Chorus - Roscoe Dash] w/ ad-libs
Early in the morning (morning...)
When shes all alone (when she's all alone)
Ima take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Kanye West]
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, yeah!

[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
She love the way Im doing it, she do it (West: HAANH!)
So G.O.O.D. she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that, what's that) my BITCH!
Hol' up, hol up, woah there
Lets capture this moment, if I hit than I own it
Marijuana every mornin, and Patronin girl, we grownin (Do it)
That pussy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on
Street lights on (on), you know I got it going til its

[Chorus - Roscoe Dash] w/ ad-libs
Early in the morning (morning...)
When shes all alone (when she's all alone)
Ima take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So, just let the song play
{And I'ma give it to you} the long way
{And give it to you} the strong way 
{We at it all day} Its our day
{Just like the song aye} its our way {Heck of a long day}
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Verse 2 - Kanye West]
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, talk to the, talk to the... haaand - Bitch!
You talking to a grown ass maaan - Bitch!
Like, way way way too much up in your pants 
For us not to make the bed squeak
{*squeaking sounds*} {There goes the bed sheets}
Erybody rip the swag off, 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off, 'cause Im rappin my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it, the "Fucking Anthem" (AHHHH!)

[Chorus - Roscoe Dash] w/ ad-libs
Early in the morning (morning...)
When shes all alone (when she's all alone)
Ima take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So, just let the song play
{And I'ma give it to you} the long way
{And give it to you} the strong way 
{We at it all day} Its our day
{Just like the song aye} its our way {Heck of a long day}
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Kanye West over end of chorus]
I be saying I uh, I think, when I know
Uh, just because...

[Verse 3 - Kanye West] + (Big Sean)
I dont really wanna uh, talk too much shit 
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when ya blazin
And I swear you turn at least half Asian
And we bout to have a liason
She cool, give head with her shades on (Whoa!)
You should just go and throw a cape on (Whoa!)
And its just so amazing

[West + Sean] So amazing, so amazing

[Big Sean]
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop, that shit look like Im speed racing
Leave 'em with me, itll boost your reputation
Westside is where Im stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, lets just pace it til it's...

[Chorus - Roscoe Dash] w/ ad-libs
Early in the morning (morning...)
When shes all alone (when she's all alone)
Ima take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So, just let the song play
{And I'ma give it to you} the long way
{And give it to you} the strong way 
{We at it all day} Its our day
{Just like the song aye} its our way {Heck of a long day}
