[Jimmy Hendrix]
Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?

[Ice-T]
Going out to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
Going out shooting my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
That ain't too good

[Ice-T]
Hey Joe, heard you shot your woman down
Hey Joe, heard you shot your old lady down
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught that girl messing around town
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught that girl messing around town
I took out my gun, then I shot her

(*Eddie Kramer Played a 38 seconds of Electronic guitar*)

[Ice-T]
I SHOT HER!!

[Ice-T]
Hey Joe, where you gonna run to now?
Hey Joe, where you gonna run to now?
Where you gonna go?
Going way down South, way down to Mexico Way
Going way down South, way down where I can be free
Ain't no hangman gonna.. get a rope around me
Ain't no hangman gonna.. get a rope around me
Til I'm gone

(*Eddie Kramer Played his Electronic guitar until faded*)</pre>
