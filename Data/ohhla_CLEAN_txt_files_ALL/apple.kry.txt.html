[Intro: Kryme Life]
It's Bluesy Blue, Big Ace on the beat yo
Yeah, It sound good don't it
It's that hit yo, Don't get it confused though
It's about time we bring it back to the apple, The big apple

[Kryme Life]
Yo shorty wanna sex me, Up in the club looking sexy
Open up the chocolate like a bottle of Nestle
Roll it up spark it, Lampin in the darkness
But it always seem to be light up where my neck be (Ohh)
All these girls standin next to me
Tryna see which ones wanna step on me
Like hmmm got rooms got extra keys
More bitches wanna go we got extra Vs (No)
Bitch please gotta X amount of cheese
Your ass gone match your attitude and that I don't need
Let me tell you what I need, A girl I could cater to her need
Rub the apple till it's shinny and it's green
Break it down on the dance floor, Hands on your knees
Perfect show a player how you work it for a G
That's right wanna ride girl don't be shy
Come on gimme some of that american pie

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
I see girls in the club with the apple, the apple
Face real nice with the apple, the apple
Body real tight with the apple, the apple
Lookin real ripe girl can I get a bite (3 times)
Let me get loose bust it up make juice girl, get loose bust it up make juice

[Kryme Life]
Girl you so curvaious I just want taste it
Tease me when you shake would love to get you naked
Front up in the basement touch the right places
Running off the henny with nothin to chase it
All night girl put away your phone
We both wrong now let me see if you can hold your own
All night girl I'm waitin just to get you alone
Now show a nigga how you work it in a thong
Pour some little mama let daddy put you on
Call you when I wanna don't be blowin up my phone
Unless it's for a booty call like Bunz and Mashaun
And you Vivica I'm just stickin ya
I aint lickin ya, aint concerned with it
The apple look good but it might got a berm in it
Once it go bad girlfriend that's permanent
Knew one girl choochie hair had a perm in it

[Chorus]

[Outro: Kryme Life]
The apple, the apple (3 times)
Get loose bust it up make juice girl (3 times)
The apple, the apple (2 times)
Let me get loose bust it up make juice girl, get loose bust it up make juice</pre>
