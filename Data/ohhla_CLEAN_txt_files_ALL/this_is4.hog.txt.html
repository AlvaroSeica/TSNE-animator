Song:   This is for My G's
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook - 4x]
This is for the G's, and this is for the hustlers
Out there on the grind, trying to satisfy the customers

[PJ]
This is for the G's, and this is for the hustlers
All the real grinders, I ain't fucking with you busters
That go get it, and come back with it
PJ I can't quit it, to the game I'm committed
Jealous niggaz and snitches, hoes and fake bitches
I'll be damned, if I let em interfere with my riches
And I know the consequences, if a nigga get caught
That's why I stay away from haters, while I'm filling the vault what

[Hook - 4x]

[Young Black]
I put the G in gangsta, the H in hustler
Young Black counting stacks, rocking diamond clusters
From dusk to dawn, I be getting it on
The early bird get the worm, so I'm up in the morn'
I got straight drop, so fiends circle the block
They smell the cooking, or they can hear me scraping the pot
Uh ring the alarm, and tell em to come get it
They looking for hard white, and I'm the first one with it for the G's

[Hook - 4x]

[Chris Ward]
This is for the G's, for the fact that I'm one of them
This is for the hustlers, for the fact I know a ton of them
Out the Boyz N' Blue click, see I'm the one that run the South
During the winter time, I spot it like a haunted house
Gouling monsters, fiends and things
How else you think I overflowed, the pinky ring with bling nigga
You see all these different colored, diamonds and shit
Well let me tell ya, it don't just come from rhyming and shit ya know

[Slim Thug]
This is for the G's, and this is for the hustlers
Out there on the grind, trying to satisfy the customers
Never sell lying, trying to satisfy the busters
I do it for them Dirty South blocks, cause they trust us
I'm repping for the real thugs, shake the fake
State to state, doing what it take to make
Another ten G stacks, sitting fat staying hungry
You in it for the fame mayn, we do it for the money
