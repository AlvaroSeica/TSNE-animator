[Atherton]
Cover your body in colored Versace and Guess or cardigan sweaters
All this garbage apparel's a lot of cotton and leather
Only the tightest of hoes, try to get clothes
Style your clothes to match the guys in the posters
And that whore in the ad
Rip the whole fashion industry, she's phony and whack
They know me at Value Village, I go there cause mall pictures
are molding a false image of bony and bald women
This fall's new collection is a whole lot of dresses
that are all too expensive and totally bland
I'm workin it out the cost of your skirt and your blouse
furnished my house, the planet will learn
It's funny for pants and a shirt
And there's money in marketing budgets
for targetting honies just getting started to fuck
When you lie in a box, you'll be happy you've acquired
a huge pile of cloth, so go shop

[Patio Decks]
This man came with brand names to promote some sort of purpose and hopes
You think that I'm as dope as what's shown on the surface?
First impressions last forever, to better your view
I coordinate my clothes colors, from clashin with my shoes
All this dude rap is two snap (C'MON LET'S GO)
I can tell this cat's whack for the simple fact he's wearin Ecko
Next show kid was blessed, rippin the live flow
In retrospect I was impressed his crest was Triple 5 Soul
Heretofore I know well your style just makes me quiver
Call up Joan - and whatever her daughter's name is - Rivers
Deliver pop culture I'll keep it consistent
I am Dockers khakis - wrinkle free and stain resistant
Gettin compliments conducive to my choice of fresh threads
While cotton shirts are shrinkin, my ego's gettin stretched
I've hidden my flesh, each stitch of well fitted garments
Therefore I'm out of harm's length in my new Faultline armor
Uh-oh, Armour's artillery is out for respect
When I inspect how you dress best present your V-necks
I see you see it, my domepiece only dope hats rest at
Fuck these cookie cutter kids in Von Dutch meshbacks
Unless you etch that, sock and sandal combination
I'm gettin Gucci gestapo to handle that alpha statement
An old fashioned fabricated my friend's social savior
I am the blood and sweat of underpaid sweatshop labor
