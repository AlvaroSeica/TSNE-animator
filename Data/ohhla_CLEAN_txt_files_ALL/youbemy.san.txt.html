Chorus: Mr. Sancho (Fingazz)
There's something special about ("You, you, you")
That makes me wanna come and be with ("You, you")
Nobody in this world compares to ("You, you, you")
I wanna tell you something, baby
I want you to come be my ("Lady")

[Chorus]

[Mr. Sancho]
(Verse 1)
I've been checking you out for a long time
I know I had to be with you when you walked by
Love the way your hips move from side to side
Do you want it from the 6-1-9?
Where you livin', in the 9-0-9
With ya behind, lookin' so fine, ready to bump and grind
Do you know me, bet I wanna know you
Let me get your number, baby, later I can roll through
And you know I got the V.I.P. status
And you know you really, really wanna have this
You gonna love it when you see the whole package
It's automatic, baby, we can make it happen
I can give you the keys, to fulfill your dreams
Make life easier than what it seems
With them luxurious things
Rose and diamond rings

[Chorus] - 2X

(Verse 2)
Baby, let me change your whole lifestyle
Let me show you how it's really going down
You're my queen, my gleam, my everyday
Sunny ray, for you, I do anything
Come a little closer, let me hold ya
Show you that affection that you only been told ta
I'll make ya feel, like a woman should, go ahead
And lay ya head on my shoulder when everything ain't going good
I know your friends telling you to stay away
Heard about the rumors and how it play
But they just sayin' that to take your place
But don't worry, cause he can't, be, replaced
Baby, you got
What I got, come on, let's get it started
I been searching for a girl like you, and I'm never ever leaving you brokenhearted

[Chorus] - 2X

Bridge: Mr. Sancho
Baby girl, don't waste no time
Baby girl, don't fall behind
Baby girl, make up your mind
You can never go wrong with me in your life

Repeat Bridge Thrice

[Chorus] - 2X
