Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!

[Verse 1]:
Yeah! Dollar bill y'all, alot of bills y'all
New year tryin to touch me a mill y'all
I came up now, now what's up now
When you shine all these haters wanan talk down
I don't feel a way, on what a nigga say
It's alright love, I let a hater hate
Pull up on them, see the paper plate
See the oyster perpectual day and date
It's a fact right, niggas act trife
How they smile in your face and they back bite
I just laugh right, make 'em mad like
Watch 'em turn around and say ain't that nice
Gettin bread though, mad head yo
It seems like they don't love you till you dead yo
Let 'em talk dawg, it don't phase me
It might not be right if they don't hate me

[Chorus]
Hustle hard, stack paper, it's alright, y'all hate us
It's nothin, we major, you see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!

[Verse 2]:
Yeah, let 'em see me, HI HATER!!!!
Pull off easy, BYE HATER!!!!
You don't like me, WHY HATER?!!!!
Won't you tell 'em how mad I make ya?
I ain't caught up, in all that hot sauce (Yeah)
Caddio white, call that Scott Storch
You don't feel me, ice grill me
Hate so bad, you wanna kill me
What it be, dawg? We gettin money here (Yeah)
Wanna snitch, man? Get us a hundred years?
That's sad, dawg, why you mad for?
Is it the face of my bitch or her ass dawg?
Why you like that? (That) That ain't right black
We balls out in the club, you don't like that? (That)
You know you like that (That) You wanna be me
Why you twistin up ya face when you see me?

[Chorus]
Hustle hard, stack paper, it's alright, y'all hate us
It's nothin, we major, you see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!

[Verse 3]:
Yeah, yeah, where the haters at? All the hatin cats
Yeah, look in the mirror, nigga hate on that (hahaha)
Can't fuck with me, or keep up with me
So you run and tell a bitch not to fuck with me (dayum!)
'Cause we ballin, and y'all crawlin
It's aight mu'fucker, keep talkin
More money brings, more Hennessy
More hate, more snakes, more enemies
Can't change this, niggas ain't shit
Wild out pop more champagne bitch
Still G's up, it won't ease up
It's cool niggas hated on Jesus
Can't tell 'em nothin, niggas say I'm stuntin
When they hate on you then they know you doin somethin

[Chorus]
Hustle hard, stack paper, it's alright, y'all hate us
It's nothin, we major, you see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!
Hi hater!!!! Hi hater!!!! You see me, hi hater!!!!</pre>
