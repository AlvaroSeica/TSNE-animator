[Sancho]
move motherfuckers out my way cause your laggin'
fu don't even trip I got the semi-automatic
static is dealt with
can nobody help this pandillero peligroso
got you putos runnin' helpless
Who wanna come fuck with these Cali Thugstahs
move motherfucker cause you can not touch us
I came to bang see my blue rag that hangs
got these grupies around me of course I've got the game
got the shit on locked steady steppin' through your block
we got these enemies wonderin' why my shit goes Pop
It don't stop..
look at the bang bang get rolled up wit a Uzi
and do what I can man and make the Chota lose me
