[George Carlin sample]
That's right, I'm a loyal American and I'm not happy
Unless I've let government and industry poison me a little bit every day
Let me have a few hundred thousand carcinogens here
Ahh, a little cancer never hurt anybody
Everybody needs a little cancer I think
It's good for you

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, and as he wrote his will, it gave me the chills
Something in the shadows, you know how that goes
And crosses don't share emotions, barely floating
Holding in words that's causing emotion
Just like the ocean breeze teases you with summer
Something living under my consciousness, what's the next obstacle?
The next platform is chains, but we act like everything is the same
Everything's arranged as far as we know
But I can feel it in my chromosomes
Something ain't right, I always wondered what's the trouble at night
What's the thunder feel like, when the cancer cells bite
I'm like flights in the night, cruise with no eyes
When the condition got me down, I tried to stay high
Fuck Vietnam, Agent Orange and flouride
I got sore eyes from the burn of a scorn life
A chemo therapy, atoms you brought home those nights

[Interlude: Bronze Nazareth (?)]
I knew something was up, man (yeah the doctor said it'll be alright though)
Feel it in my bones, man (you know that's life)
How you feeling now? (you know, I'm alright baby)
Everything good? (yeah, yeah)
It's good to hear from you though (it's good to hear from you too)
(I'mma be alright, man) aight

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, something pulling at me, my veins is drumming
I know my blood pressure bust pipes, I'm a stroke of genius on mics
Shit feel strange tonight, look out the front door, grass frosted
Visions of Jesus carrying crosses, I'm kind of off it
Shit is too heavy, my lungs tight
Heartbeat steady, my palms sweaty, in the kitchen, she bitching
Dinner almost ready, my shadow in the bay window
Back of my skull tingles, can't find the fucking remote
I hate these videos, same shit, different toilet deceiving
Like I can ask Marvin Gaye Sr. why did you peel him?
Damn, I must be blow, smoke clouds in the air
Slumped down in the chair, heard the snare or was it a shot
My girl said I looked pale, and spilled my wine on the couch...
Weeding out...</pre>
