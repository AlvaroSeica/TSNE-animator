[Hodgy Beats]
Being in your presence, has become an obsession
I'm trying to find the right words to make a good impression
Girl you got the right curves, the smile as your expression
I give you what you deserve rub your body while you restin
She be my ghetto queen, and I call her Ms. Thing
and I'm corrected with Mrs. cause I gave her the big ring
I hold her Louis bag, we get off to switch planes
Sharin the same thoughts, like we switched brains
We sorta like Jamie Foxx, she just like me
Her swagger skyscraper, cause she just wifey
And I just might be, thinkin 'bout her all the time
I pick her up and never let her fall behind
If you need that, baby I got'cha
Staring on a court, never off the roster
I make her heart sing like opera
And I let her feed me cookies cause, I'm the Cookie Monster

[Chorus One: Hodgy Beats]
Cupid, arrows, all the above
We got each other, we got the love
Cupid, arrows, all the above
We got each other, we got the love
L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E
We got the L-O-V-E
We got the L-O-V-E
We got the love

[Chorus Two: Frank Ocean]
Baby we can take it slow, we don't have to race
Slightly give a little gas, and pick up the pace
I lost sight of the past, when I saw your face
You were the pencil to the pad, and erase the pain away

[Hodgy Beats]
If you need comfort, then I can be a cure
If you unsure baby, I can make you sore
Bring out in the lion in you instead of the insecure
Don't be suicidal I won't open up your door hahaha
Super fly chick, suicide whip
Two seated Coupe baby, you and I dip
Off, in another world on that and I shhhh
Can't nobody take me away, from my Goddess

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Outro]
Gone, I feel so good (ohhhhhhh)
I feel real good
We got the what? L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E
We got the L-O-V-E {*2X*}
We got the love</pre>
