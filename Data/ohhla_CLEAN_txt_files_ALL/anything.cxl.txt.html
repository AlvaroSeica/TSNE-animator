[Chorus: repeat 2X]
{"Run, run, run, away"}
{"Lost, lost, lost, my mind"}
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything~!

[Chino XL]
Yo, locked in a hospital, a dead nurse with big tits
and slit wrists tried to administer me pills but I resist
I'm dangerous as crocodiles out of tanks
You don't need my DNA strands to recognize my killer traits (no thanks)
I lost my mind, I'm haunted by the words that I've invented
to the point they're feeding me glasses of Nyquil with my dinner
I associate the infliction of pain with pleasure
Frequently insult my neighbors wearing blood-stained leathers
People that never visit insist I owe 'em shit
I'm repeatedly takin Rohypnol and prayin I don't exist (help me!)
Damn near wanna throw a party off exhilaration
that I get from squeezin the life out of a human body shakin (save me!)
I'm a happenin waitin to accident, blessed sacrament
Festerin blasphemy, intransient arrogant acrobat
Riding camelbacks under circus tents, nervous off Percocets
Possessed laughs 'til I'm at Bernie Mac's funeral services (get 'em!)

[Chorus]

[Chino XL]
(My mind's gone) You've got mental problems I'm sure, it's just that mine is greater
At least you have honor to live in the time I put ink to paper
Over 10,000 hours of labor limitless
An undeniable perfectionist that plagues the souls of lyricists (yeah)
Hand me a scalpel, I'll scribble scribes on your face
I make people run, that's why they call it the human race
XL campaign, don't owe you a damn thing
Tear a turtle's head off, drink blood out of shells like canteens
I can't scream, I got the metal machines ready
Forever holdin my piece/peace like I'm not objectin at a wedding
Was manufactured in Heaven to be a horrid tourist
Placed specifically on Earth, quantum leaps over other artists (for real!)
Dirty my name, the seeds of discontent were planted
That's grounds for murder, I'm stoned, you took me for +granite+
Damn it, you think I owe you somethin, get it in blood
Rick James' last words, "Chino's verse is a hell of a drug"

[Chorus]

[Chino XL]
(Get me out of here) I just needed some time to get my mind right
Then it's back to these bitches yellin +Go Daddy+ like the website
Run away, don't cross me
You won't be able to walk through your house without trippin over some dead offspring
(Crazy!) I'm gettin stressed by the government
Don't even write my name down unless it has "Paid to the Order" in front of it
Budget it, tryin to feed your family's real
Gas prices lookin bigger than the numbers on Adele's bathroom scale
My skill's internal and runnin wild (runnin wild)
I could eat a Rubik's Cube and shit it out completely solved
I vowed my foundation is built with brick and mortar
Destroyin peers/piers like a tsunami tearin through a harbor (yeah!)
Consistantly ill, but still industry overlook me
Officially somethin's fishier than mermaid pussy
I hate you with a perfect hate and nothin less
Last seven words - the best ever from the best yet (yeah!)

[Chorus]
