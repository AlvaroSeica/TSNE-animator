[Intro/Chorus: Trigger Tha Gambler]
I cramp your style, with a bullet and a smile
I cramp your style, with a bullet and a smile
I cramp your style, with a bullet and a smile

I cramp your style, with a bullet and a smile (Yeah!)
I cramp your style, with a bullet and a smile
I cramp your style, with a bullet and a smile

I cramp your style, with a bullet and a smile
I cramp your style, with a bullet and a smile
I cramp your style, with a bullet and a smile (Check it, UHH!)

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Niggaz on the DL, casing me out
Hawking my jewels, feeling for their tools
When they come they gots to come correct
Because they know I catch wreck, a well known wild street vet
Step into the kill zone, baby, it's on
I pack the twin nine-mills that'll lift your dome (UHH!)
Chrome pump with double-eyed slots and such
A fully-auto Mac-dime that is sure to touch ya (UHH!)
Bust you with the Desert Eagle
Street legal, move against my people and the Ice gets evil (Yeah!)
Hit you with the .44 Smith &amp; Wes-Son
You're best to run cause my Tech eats pests
I got a glock with the laser, hot police taser
Step in real close, I hit your throat with the razor (UHH!)
You wanna live or die, it's your decision
Talk shit, you're dissing, I got you in my night vision
Brain fragments on the street released
Another nigga fronts hard, another nigga deceased
I got a H.K., A.K. and a M-1-6
A 12-gauge street sweeper with the circular clip (Yeah!)
Quick to let projectiles fly, you die
And watch your fat moms cry - bull's eye

[Chorus: Trigger Tha Gambler X2]

[Ice-T] What you think all the guns is for?

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Yo, what you think all the guns is for? (UHH!)
What's up? - niggaz don't seem to hear
Still looking crazy, let me make this clear
Fool, the Ice ain't having it
And when I let loose lead, believe I'm accurate (UHH!)
Fat scope on a 30-Ack-6
Sawed-off double barrel and a pistol grip (UHH!)
Pump on my lap at all times
I fill my gauge shells with nickels and dimes
Thompson Center, spitting .45 slugs
Black Mac-11, Python .3-57, Snub-nose .38 or .3-8-0
Seventy Automatic, full metal jackets (Yeah!)
Hollow points coming at you fast
You'll feel the slug before you hear the blast (Come On!)

[Chorus: Trigger Tha Gambler X2]

[Ice-T] What you think all the guns is for?

[EvilE] Yeah, Uhha, yeah, guns is for?

[Interlude: Ice-T]
Yeah, now Montreux's in the house
I wanna hear somebody out there; say YEAH!! (YEAH!!)
Say HELL YEAH!! (HELL YEAH!!)

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I don't like shooting, but I do shoot straight
Niggaz I be rolling with, will shoot up a wake
Why you wanna step in the sights of a nigga?
Known hair trigger, the coroner delivers (UHH!)
More cold bodies to the morgue each weekend
One minute you're breathing, next minute you're leaking
Best to listen close cause I ain't no boast and
Never forget that I leave you wet
Bloody, sticky, holes in your Dickey's
Oh! what a pity, looking all shitty
My Winchester will get the best of ya
Hand grenades will fade all the rest of ya
I reach out and touch you with the parabellum (UHH!)
You got a crew, you better tell them

[Chorus: Trigger Tha Gambler X2]

[EvilE] Yeah, Uhha, uhha, you know what I'm saying?
[Ice-T] Yo, what you think all the guns is for?
[EvilE] Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[Ice-T] Yo, what you think all the guns is for?</pre>
