Hold up, shut this shit down

We about to black out to fuckin Brooklyn, with my nigga Mister Cee
cause you know how the fuck I get down!
Big dog, pitbull status nigga!

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah..
You're now enterin the mode of the notorious Biggie Smalls
Junior M.A.F.I.A. click, representin
This one goin out to Brooklyn, y'all know what time it is
It's goin out to all the gangsters
All the pimps and players, hoes and bitches
Y'all know what time it is.. so this what I want y'all to do
I want y'all to grab y'all Dutch Masters 
and y'all White Owls and y'all Phillies.. mmm!
Get you a fat sack, a pint of Hennessey and lay back 
Gon' do this one for my man Mister Cee, representin all day, everyday
And all you other tape niggaz, and bootleggers, stay in the house
Cause Brooklyn got this shit locked down
So any time you're ready Mister Cee
we gon' get hardcore on these homos

Like I said before, Junior M.A.F.I.A. click, hardcore
Uhh, representin
Biggie Smalls in the house
Uhh, check it, huh

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
Biggie Smalls is the wickedest
Niggaz say I'm pussy?  I dare you to stick your dick in this
If I was pussy I'd be filled with syphillis
Herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, gettin rid of ya
Got it locked like the penitentiary
Niggaz mention me for M.C. execution, who you choosin?
The wack MC?  Or the black fat MC? 
Jack Dempsey would start shakin
All it's takin, is some marijuana and I'm makin
MC's break fast like flapjacks and bacon
Backspins to windmill, who's still the gin drinker
Ill thinker - explodin when the paper hits the ink, uhh
Take your gangsta chronicles, turn to page 666
Holocaust, Big the merciless
Niggaz press they luck-and they get a buttfuck-in
Straight up the ass, raw dog with the rash
and I don't fuck wit the condoms
The condoms is a problem from the AIDS gettin sprayed
Diseases, Big pleases, MC's across the seas
is just the way I clutch my prey, hey
I'm crazy and deranged
Blowin niggaz out the frame, simple and plain
But gettin back, to the black, rhinocerous of rap
Big took a loss, how preposterous is that nigga?
Recognize.. notorious Biggie Smalls, ninety-four, "Ready to Die"
Y'all niggaz hold y'all heads
Mister Cee, set it off baby-pop..
