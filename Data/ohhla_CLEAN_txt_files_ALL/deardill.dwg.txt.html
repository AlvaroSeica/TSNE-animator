[Intro: Phife]
Dilla Dawg..
Had a dream about you, fam
It's 2005, we in the same hospital room
You on one side, I'm on the other
I'm stressed out, but what gave me motivation 
was you pullin out that MP, and bangin out some bangers as usual
Nothin ever fade you, fam, and for that, I miss you
("Let's go!"
