Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Juicy J]
Swagger under
Trippy niggas... let's get ratchet

[Chorus x2: Wiz Khalifa (Juicy J)]
I'm loadin up and I'm ridin out, they talkin shit but they hidin out
Real niggas know what I'm talkin bout...
(I'm loadin up and I'm ridin out, they talkin shit but they hidin out)
(Real niggas know what I'm talkin bout...)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
(Trippy, trippy, trippy, turn up)
Rack after rack, I got the sack, geeked up of beans, pack after pack (yeah ho)
Stay with the nina' 2 cups and a zip, Juicy don't fight I just empty them clips (yeah ho)
Blowing like cash, high off the gas, pay 20 stacks and they run up and blast (yeah ho)
Next time you're see him this face on the shirt, next time car he ride in, stretch limo hearse
See why you niggas mad nigga, that to me you so cash nigga
Stuffed in a Louie bag nigga, Juicy J be that nigga
Big bag of that stank killer, codeine in my drink killer
Mostly niggas be lyin sayin they is but ain't killers
Nigga wanna play with me, I'm a break him off
Give my youngins, they'll do it, I'm a bring em out (get em)
They gon' get on your ass then they flyin takin off (get em)
Nigga we gon take a life before we take a loss [gunshot]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
My diamonds sing like Ray J homie, every day's a payday
Rollin up that KK, now it's going down like mayday
All my niggas be chilling, stacking money to the ceiling
Used to smoking out the parking lot, now we owning a building oh
Used to tell niggas I was gonna here but they ain't really understand
Now they see me in that brand new Rari and start to think I'm the man
Now my jeans cost a grand, now my shows fill the stands
Now they see that I'm ballin cause of how they bring in them bands, ooh
Now when niggas be tourin, now my money be foreign
All my niggas be scorin, section very important
I'm cakin up, you fakin up, I'm rollin weed when I'm wakin up
Instead of talkin shit and try to hate on us just grab a joint and come bake with us
(Fuck nigga, hahahaha, uhh)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
(Look, okay, okay)
Front page, I'm on the news: nigga call me a dropout
Real nigga, 100, never needing no copout (nah)
Diamonds on my chain just pop off, you already know what I'm bout
Got bad bitches from overseas but I need a big ass from the south
Look at us, we made it, bottles up in the air now
25 racks a night, give a fuck bout sweating your hair out
Getting trippy man with some frisky things; I am the shit and you niggas anus
'Cause if I mention ya'll I'm a make you famous you still ain't nothing, I'm stainless
We famous, anything you want right now, baby girl just name it
And I'm a get real deep in the pussy; the number one nigga, ain't no need for replacement
Getting in my spaceship, I'm high as a bitch, fly as a bitch
Okay Juicy and Wiz, every day we do this shit

[Chorus]</pre>
