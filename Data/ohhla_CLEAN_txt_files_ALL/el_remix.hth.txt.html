[Verse 1: Pressure]
Don't stop or hesitate, lyrical blows will make you levitate
Brothers think they're fat, damn they're fucking feather weight
For heavens sake, I never crossed over ever mate
I regularly elevate, my upper men regulate, I never make
statements hurt, I can't back the featherweight
MC's selling their souls while the record company celibrates
Like selling rates
They're sleeping while I'm well awake
I celebrate while they feel the rainy weather mate
Some well awake, the album drop but they never make
They telling me to prepare for the venom when they smell a snake
There's a thousand stories in the city that are hell or fake
That never went from vinyl, waste time to elevate
Together mate all we need is to delegate
Some rhyme power so that enough force can generate
And segregate the real from the fellas fakers
It's time for b-boys to get yours together mate

[Hook] {x4}
I don't stop the body rock (yeah just elevate...)
(We say)
Don't stop the body rock (we elevate...)
(We say)

[Verse 2: Suffa]
Ahhhh... B-boy, verbally littering, configuring, lettering, sampling
phat as delivery
Words on the world that I'm living in
Unforgiving and my style, no considering, giving in
Accelerate, don't deviate, aggravate
Featherweights, who better wait
Never hesitate, get us straight
Elevate, til you levitate
Demonstrate skills that the hills will celebrate
Impersonators situate styles that you emulate
Lacerate foes with the flows that I punctuate
Intimidate, interlay, how was I stimulated? 
Cowards imitate my style, try to simulate
Beginner make noise, b-boys digging in the crate
Innovate, bones cut the record til your finger break
Integrate sounds underground, I'll bomb em' mate
Nominate the hoods for the crew to dominate

[Hook] {x8 til fade}</pre>
