Make yourself comfortable
Ehehehe!
Hi, my, name, is, Don, Cor-neo
And, I, just, want, some-one, to, love
Yes that's Don Cor-neo not to be confused with Corleone...
No

Some may say that I'm kind of a perv
But not at all, cause Poppa Don told me
if there's grass on the field
then it's time to play - ball
I keep some whips and chains
Normal lovemakin bores me
Just listen to my name
In spanish it means Mr. Horny
Hi Tifa, nice to meet you
Your shirt is almost see-through
Yes that's a salami in my pocket
But I am glad to see you
So welcome to my mansion
My palace of romancin
You want some information
and I wanna get your pants and, so...

We both have something the other, wants
Ehehehe!
Hi, my, name, is, Don, Cor-neo
And, I, use a hula hoop, to hold up, my pants
Yes I am obese but there's more to looooooove...
Well
Some may say that I'm a sexual deviant
But I would say that I am rather lenient
The term sex slave
makes it sound, so, bad~!!
I want a bride who won't run
when it's sexy time, though if I
have to chase you I won't mind
I just need my inhaler!
When I bring in other women she's not mad at me
I can punch her and she won't call it battery
Because right now the only thing attracted to me
is... gravity
So come here girl, slip out of those jeans
I'll ditch those other two, switch scenes
Crossdressers, whorehouses?
Are you sure this game's for teens?</pre>
