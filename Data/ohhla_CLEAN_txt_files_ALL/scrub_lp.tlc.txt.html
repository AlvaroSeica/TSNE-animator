[Chilli]
A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So...

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of time and

1 - 	I don't want no scrub
	A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
	Hangin' out the passenger side
	Of his best friend's ride
	Trying to holler at me

	I don't want no scrub
	A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
	Hangin' out the passenger side
	Of his best friend's ride
	Trying to holler at me

[Chilli]
Well a scrub checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know he can not approach me
Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass
So...

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of time and

Repeat 1

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma 
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no

No scrub, no scrub
No, no

No scrub, no scrub
No, no 

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
