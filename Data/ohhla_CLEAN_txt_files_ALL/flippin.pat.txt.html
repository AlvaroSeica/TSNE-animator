(Intro)
Know what I'm sayin?
I'm flippin and stackin and flexin on you sissy ass niggas
You know what I'm sayin?

(Hook)
Keep you suckas in my rear view
My money on my mind
Give a fuck about that other shit
I love them dollar signs
You on some sucka shit
Only thang you runnin is your mouth
You on some other shit
Only thang you runnin is your mouth
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin

(Verse 1)
You catch me in and out the bank, desire; know I'm on my grind
She say fuck a horoscope, she just love them dollar signs
Bitch I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm robbin, I'm jackin
I'm strapped up nigga, I'm smashin
Been pimpin hos, been hittin lics
Been robbin tricks, lil nigga what's happenin?
Got a crazy plug on that surp
Got a stupid plug on that work
Y'all just talkin, flaugin dog
Ain't never put in no work
Paid the price for that sack and bought me that purp
Clientele on that curb, Cobain let's work
Triple ol G a perk, ghetto gossip church
Talk to 'em, pulpit
Money motivated, fuck bullshit
Grip anything I can get
Dedicated to stackin grip
They screw face, frustrated cause they ain't havin shit

(Hook)
Keep you suckas in my rear view
My money on my mind
Give a fuck about that other shit
I love them dollar signs
You on some sucka shit
Only thang you runnin is your mouth
You on some other shit
Only thang you runnin is your mouth
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin

(Verse 2)
Watch it stack up to the ceiling
Buy a house and stash the cash
I'm addicted to the money, some say I came up fast
They should make a movie of my life, romance for these cashes
Rubber bands and Ben Franks, they'll never find my stashes
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, she fuckin, she suckin; I skeeted all in her mouth
I'm smokin, she drankin, she naked, I'm thankin I'ma beat it up on the couch
Money motivate, pussy niggas hate country nigga from the south
You talk shit but ain't got shit, so you can stick a dick in your mouth
Wanna roll like a trucker
A slick motherfucker
Said her pussy was for sale, but me; I'm not a sucker
Countin up plenty bands
Smokin too many strands
Got straps on deck for you, muhfucka who will dance?

(Hook)
Keep you suckas in my rear view
My money on my mind
Give a fuck about that other shit
I love them dollar signs
You on some sucka shit
Only thang you runnin is your mouth
You on some other shit
Only thang you runnin is your mouth
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin
I'm flippin, I'm stackin, I'm flexin</pre>
