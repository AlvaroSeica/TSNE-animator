(first verse)
SAY WHAT YOU OUGHTA

CUZ THERE'S A PARTY GOIN ON
HOTEL MOTEL IM GOIN IN
DONT CARE WHAT THEY SPENT
CANT PREVENT THE EVENT
SOME RUN TO IT
SHUN FROM IT

STILL ROCK TO IT
I SUE IVE BEEN SUED DUDE
WITH THIS NEWS FIT TO SPIT
AND THE BEAT GOES ON

(BREAK)

(second verse)
NEVER BITTER BUT BETTER
BACKED BY THE FACT
ALL I GOT IS MY WORD
THE NEW CURSE WORD IS BLACK
SAY THE TEST

THE CURSE

CRAWLING LIKE A MAGGOT OUTTA THEY MIND
FASTER THAN A GO GO 45
SHIT IS LIVE, SURVIVE
HIGH WITH OUT A GOTTDAMN REASON WHY BASKETBALL WIVES
AINT REALLY WIVES
BIRDS DROPPIN OUT FF THE SKY
AND YALL GOOGLE WHY?

chorus
I SHALL NOT BE MOVED

(bridge)

SO HEED THE PEOPLE
HELP THE HOMELESS
UNDERFED
REVOLUTION
STOP THE FEDS
LEAVIN PEOPLE
LEFT FOR DEAD
WHERES YOUR GROOVE?
CHECK YOUR HEADS
I SHALL NOT NOT BE MOVED
I SHALL NOT BE MOVED
UH COME ON.

(verse 3)
DRIVE BY TRUCKER I PLAY IT LOUD MOTHERFUCKER
USE IT DONT ABUSE IT THE VOICE GETS ROUGHER
SHOUT MY VOCALS I SALUTE ALL THE LOCALS
SLEPT ON KEPT THEM OUT OF RADIO FOCUS
HOCUS POCUS SPOOKS SITTING BY THE SOUND
CORPORATIONS DICTATE WHAT GOIN DOWN
LOCAL ACTS I GOT YOUR BACK
UNDERGROUND MAKE EM RUN TILL ITS DARK
RUN EM OUT OF TOWN
THEY GOT ME STARTED WHERE I START?
CAUSE I DO IT TO SUPPORT THE ART
WHAT GOOD IS LEARNIN FROM SOME RECORD
WHEN YALL ONLY LISTEN TO 15 SECONDS?</pre>
