Big up! To all my haters! (UH!) All my haters! (Yeah!) All my haters!

[Verse One: Tony Yayo] (Sample courtesy of "Dey Know" by Shawty Lo)
Fuck state greens! I'm tryin to cake bitch!
Quart a key, I ball a key, Blake Griff
Jet-ski, black sand, bad bitch
My passport need pieces for the next trip
Fall asleep you got the cars that your ass dream of
Kush loud packed, bet ya bitch blow some steam off
I keep the rueger under the rugby
These hoes hear the rumours and they love me, love me
Fast cars, loose women the high life
We bust bottles, smoke weed, all night
Hermes cost as much as the gators so... (Big up! To all my haters!)

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Roscoe Dash)
All we do is stunt and get the paper pa-paper (WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!)
The ballin make a hater wanna hate us ha-hate us (WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!)
Can't take it when they see the money makers, we make a...  (WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!)
Whole lotta money (MONEY!) Wh-Wh-Whole lotta money (GO!)
All we do is stunt and get the paper pa-paper (WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!)
The ballin make a hater wanna hate us ha-hate us (WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!)

Shawty Lo, I hear you haters, all the small talk a little later

Got them bitch niggas like New Jack City
Count remind me money name Magic City
Bitch I'm Shawty! Ball hog Shawty!

And I got the whole G-G-G-G-G-Unit with me! 50!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Roscoe Dash)

[Verse Three: Roscoe Dash] (*Sample courtesy of "Dey Know" by Shawty Lo)
Attracted to the money like bees on honey (YEAH!)
My swag on dummy (YEAH!) Cash on runnin (YA DIG!)
And, I'm way more than what you ask for honey (I KNOW!)
In fact It's on collect plate from the last four sundays (GO!)
I'm ill, hold the pills, my skills, Soul IV Real (YA DIG!)
Now watch this Candy Rain fall I'm her grill no hands for real (WHAT!) 
I'm on a whole 'nother plateau, Lean Back Fat Joe (GO!)
I ain't got time to be concerned with you assholes (NO!)
The status outrageous (YA DIG!) I'm only y'all hatin (I KNOW!)

I feel your frustration for my very last statement um...
(*Big up! To all my haters!)

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Roscoe Dash)
All we do is stunt and get the paper pa-paper (WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!)
The ballin make a hater wanna hate us ha-hate us (WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!)
Can't take it when they see the money makers, we make a...  (WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!)
Whole lotta money (MONEY!) Wh-Wh-Whole lotta money (GO!)
