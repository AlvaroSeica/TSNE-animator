[Intro: Nashawn]
Yea, Money Machine, Money Machine, Yea C'mon

[Verse 1]
This goes for dudes confused we over rule
Disrespectful views of the King of NY
Fuck that, why try? though lie in his eye
Now we readin' it, that's that hype shit from sayin' it
Conscience of your non-sense in '99
Rob more niggaz than, tuck wit the .9
Toast shit like Compton, nigga rep B
You wanna get on dunn, you need to ask Reek
Ain't no other Kings in this rap shit, they siblings
None but my Children, we pop they disappearin'
Remember when MC's used to be on funny shit
Than Notorious came out, listen, study shit
Now we on some Money Shit, Machine is out the Blue
You light-weight, Nash milli my white Coke
Makes the skills shake, that's why my paper neva funny
And you still re-coup it, stupid it!

[Hook: Nashawn] **2X**
Yea, let's get this Cash, let's get this Cake
Let's get it so fast and enjoy this Paper

[Verse 2]
Back in Elementary - a nigga drinkin' Hennessey
Wasn't alone I grew up amongst a Don bree
I want my .9 didn't need a place to rest
And now I got 'Money Machine' Tatted on my chest
Lord could you feel me
Fuck the people in the past, we wanna last
Keep your sugar finger fast
Remember thuggish? no longer livin' he deceased
Call up the Sirens, he was murdered in the streets
May he Rest in Peace
I'm on the low smokin' weed, that's how it be
And you don't wanna fuck wit me, bitch nigga please

[Hook: Nashawn] **2X**
Yea, let's get this Cash, let's get this Cake
Let's get it so fast and enjoy this Paper

[Verse 3]
Deep in the middle of Little Italy dealin' wit some middle-men
nigga I bust you in the cherry red 7-60
Got the glizzy locked in the stizzy
Drunked pissy buck 60 down in one-wizzy
(What's that?) y'all niggaz still buyin' Hub Cabs
Back of the Shack, came back in the Benz back

[Hook: Nashawn] **2X**
Yea, let's get this Cash, let's get this Cake
Let's get it so fast and enjoy this Paper

[Outro: Nashawn]
Yea, Rest in Peace Biggie Smalls
Rest in Peace 2pac - Rest in Peace Big Pun
