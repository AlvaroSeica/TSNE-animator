Chorus: (Snoop) 
Nigga dem haters 
Can't fade us, 
We soldiers 
High rollers, 
We ganstas 
Big banksters, We motherfuckin' ganstas 

(Snoop) 

It's hound dog and snoop dog, what ya'll thought?
Hell motherfuckin' yeah bitch, 
it's my motherfuckin' fault see you wanna roll with me
try to come with me, bitch thats just your fantasy
I'm doggy d from the DPG, and bitch gotta raise up off of me 
I see more niggas hangin' out backstage
wanna autograph for your bitch that's cute, don't shoot 
no repelent cause suckas keep on failin',
but I'm a dog so fuck em all bitch I keep on bailin'
sellin' millions at a time, blazin' up thembackwoods 
white woods in the phillies can you feel me and oh so few 
niggas wanna kill me, but if they knew me I don't really think 
they wanna do nothin' to me nigga 

Chorus 2x 

(Full Blooded) 
I flash the tank when dem niggas don't know
my she hound wants the time of the day 
I let her check da rolex
I flush the big bodied charlie with da limo tint 
chokin' on somethin' 
scopin' on somethin' 
Snoop Dogg and Hound Dogg, we gon ball dog 
and when we gone dog fuck em all dog! 
I know they hatin' on me, in the cut waitin' on 
I done came up with Snoop 
they wanna build a case on me pockets on swole, 
my fuckin' mind on hold but they don't hear me though
I'm on that endoe big dog dark as the tank
we ain't on no leash raw doggin' shit wherever we be 
wherever we be 

Chorus 4x 

(Snoop Talking)

strait from the West Coast down south all over your area
