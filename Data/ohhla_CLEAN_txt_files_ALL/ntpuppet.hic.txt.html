[Hi-C]
Here's a little story I'd like to tell
About a situation guys and girls know very well
Everything is fine then dandy and you love it
Til dope make you treat another person like a puppet

(Verse 1)
Now I talked to this girl for about two weeks
And I've been many places and seen many freaks
But this girl was just fly
Her body good, lookin
I was a fish just flappin' and she was like hookin'
I got to know her, by spending some time
She gave me things of hers for some things of mine
Everything was goin' good, couldn't nothin' go better
Anything she wanted to do, Hi-C would just let her
Wasn't like them other niggas tryin' to screw her up
I would rush her to the mall
And straight cold do her up
Have a drank, when she by my side
I want the bitch to look good when she rollin' in my ride
Three weeks later
I noticed a change
Somethin' wasn't right, she was actin' kind of strange
Took some money out my stash, and stuffed it in her purse
You think if things is gettin' bad, shit, it's gonna get worse
Well, look like I got myself a few problems
But me, being Hi-C, you know I'm gonna solve 'em
She ran out the house, and drove down the street
Stopped to buy some crack from my homeboy Pete
I couldn't believe, what I was told
He gave the bitch double-up for a thick piece of gold
So I creeped up on on the bitch and said "Hoe, I caught ya"
Now, by the way
Where's the link I bought ya?"
Now this girl must've lost her mind
Scrappin' up dough with some things of mine
I want to beat her
Better yet, stomp her
Break out the 12-gauge, and full of buckshots, pump her
But I said, "Nah, fuck it, I'm a chill
This girl need help, she's mentally ill"
She start to trip, she got to spendin' my grip
So I just had to rip the pipe out her lips
She cried, "Crawf, please give me some money
"I promise I'll stop, please, Killer Crawf honey"
I felt sorry for the girl cause she's being misused
It was the crack and the devil, ridin' to abuse

Refrain: Hi-C
This relationship just ain't gon' last
Girl, I'm a have to get rid of your ass
Cause you-eh, you're on my dick, dick, ding-a-ling
Tryin' to tie my arms and legs with the string
My money, mmm hmm, I know you love it
But let me tell you one thing I'm not
I'm not your

(Verse 2)
Hopped out the bed about three o'clock
Stumbled to the door when I heard the knock
I thought "Damn
Now who in the fuck could this be"
When I got to the door, she said "Crawf, it's me
I thought we supposed to go out this week"
I said, "Not tonight girl, I'm 'bout to go back to sleep"
But by being a big booty, hell of a freak
Before I closed the door, she blocked the shit with her feet
Pushed her way in, didn't use much force
She said, "I know we goin' out," I said "Yeah, of course"
I'm staring at this bitch, wonderin' if she alright
Cause where in the fuck we 'posed to go this time of the night
But the only thing, that was on my mind
Was just shoving my dick up this bitch behind
She thought that I forgot
That she was the one that was smoking rocks
I looked at the girl and I said "Babe, you know what Mark said?
Your ass ain't nothin but a base head"
She disagreed, she said "Stop lyin'"
Her feelings were hurt, so she broke out cryin'
I said, "Baby, you gotta help yourself
Don't expect help, from anyone else"

Repeat Refrain

(Verse 3)
The girl's dumb
She was straight out sprung
Yep, dope was the rope, and her soul was hung
Now one day, I went to see my DJ
The grand, incredible, wizard Tony A.
Got to his house, then I knocked on the door
The nigga didn't answer so I banged once more
I wondered, where in the fuck he was at
So I jumped off the porch, then I bailed to the back
He was there cause I heard the system thumpin'
Went up to the window and heard the bed bumpin'
I grabbed the crate just to peep through the window
The trick I kicked it with was getting played like Nintendo
Jumped in the window and I said, "what's up?"
Tony had her bent over, he was working the butt
She seen my face, and she started to scream
I said, "Shut up bitch, you gettin' double-teamed"
Popped my dick in her mouth and we rocked it back and forth
From the east to the west, the south and the north
I got tired and said, "Man, I quit"
Tony A. said, "Crawf, pay this bitch"
I grabbed a rock and she started to flip
The hoe wanted to smoke, man this girl was a trip
She said, "Yo, check this out, man
My dope smokes in the pipe, and it melts in my hand"
Now that you sucked my dick, had Tony fucked you in the ass
I know this relationship just ain't gonna last
Cause you-eh, you're on my dick, dick, ding-a-ling
Tryin' to tie my arms and legs with the string
My money, mmm hmm, I know you love it
But let me tell you one thing I'm not
I'm not your

"Puppet"

Bridge: Hi-C
Well, I pulled out my dick
Popped it, in her mouth
And she sucked it
Picked up her dress
And seen this, bloody mess
So I said, "Fuck it" (Fuck it...)

Outro: Hi-C
Now the story that I told won't make me rich
But this, I tell about a bitch bein' dumped in the ditch
Tony, I'm a knock her ass out, man, fuck it
Hey hoe, I'll hurt ya
I'm not your
