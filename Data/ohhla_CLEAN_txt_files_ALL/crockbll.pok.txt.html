[Big Pokey]
Say dog, off top I'm a pistol packer
Might come for you one deep, I might blitz my backers
Head cracker flat bed, big head stacker
Dog I go hard for my scrilla, I'm a gorilla
In the booth I go off, like a chrome 3-80
Let it loose out my roof, for the chrome to wave it
Bout my pesos, in the kitchen cooking my queso
Body shots drop niggaz, better send em to Maaco
I'm fins to blow this bitch up, like I'm David Carush
My weed'll blow your wig back, like I gave you a brush
I crush niggaz toes, like I crush niggaz hoes
Push a plush fo' do', plus I roll alone
I drank's by myself, and I smoke's by myself
What the dice do, dog I'm trying to roll some mo'
Work a zone, like a pro tool
28 but I'm old school, send it straight like I'm 'pose to

[Chorus - 2x]
I'm a crock bull, roaming the streets
(I'm a four alarm loaded with heat, both prone to sheets)
We make grimy look good, and gangsta look complex
(you niggaz ain't hood, you just acting out of context)

[D-1]
Ain't you D-1 nigga, wanna po' lil' niggaz
Now get that shit right, I wanna po' real niggaz
Not a KKK, but will kill niggaz
And your flow is old school, sorta like Hilfiger
Rap dope through your tablet, 'fore you try to deal with us
Nigga get your weight up, 'fore you try to chill with us
These punchline rappers, you niggaz need to quit
Spitting anything, but you ain't meaning shit
Get a purpose in your rap, 'fore you rhyme in your lines
And try to commit, some of the crime in your lines
Say you grind in your lines, I don't see you with the work
Stop lying in your lines, 'fore you end up getting merked
Take time in your lines, stop spitting in a verse
Cause I guarantee you niggaz, don't fit in many hearse
Be the cleanest nigga in church, but you laying down
Nigga M.O.B. style, niggaz don't fuck around
 
[Chorus - 2x]

[Kevo]
People make power moves, and put the rules on hold
Dues are gone, pockets on cruise control
From the Tre to the Stone, we don't play with the chromes
For the right price, these niggaz'll lay in your homes

[Big Pokey]
Niggaz get hulled, 2-23's whizzing your skull
Making you homeless, you ain't the nigga you thought you was
I put niggaz on ice, pine box em up
I might kidnap your T-Jones, might rock your slut

[Kevo]
My connect correct, I ain't gotta stretch my work
Break the pyrex, set the grams on extra hurt
Lock 40 in the cookie, like it's 79
Then what, set the price between 7 and 9

[Big Pokey]
I drive a hoop, real good and manage my ends
I kept my Benz in the bank, and put my Jag in the den
Coffee mugs three mic's, two gats and a hen
I'm here to stay like the tats in your skin, get it right

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
