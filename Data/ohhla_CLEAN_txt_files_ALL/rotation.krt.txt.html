[Chorus]
Old school when I ride, forever sky high
Working wood wheel when the sun outside
I'm just rotating my tires, rotating my tires
Rotating my tires, rotating my tires
Not a care in the world, me and my girl
Candy-coated pearl with the bowling ball swirl
I'm just rotating my tires, rotating my tires
Rotating my tires, rotating my tires

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Now this could be one of those days, I chop on my blades
Leave my worries behind, just pretend that I'm paid
Do it big, do it large on the boulevard
Get a sense of success pushing candy cars
I did some thangs for that Chevy mayne, restored the frame
Blew the brains out on everythang, I ain't ashamed
Scooped my dame cause she down to roll, since way befo'
Don't touch my screens or my radio (say what?), she know the sco'
Old school

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Now this could be one of those days, parlay and I ball
Turning necks till they break, outside of the mall
Going in, going hard like a superstar
Break the bank, full tank take me super far
I swang and bang, sitting heavy mayne, hogging lanes
Candy paint never leave a stain, let it rain
Hydroplane, but I'm riding slow, eyes closed
Etta James keep me on my toes (say what?), can't let her go
Old school

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T. - singing]
Wheels on the slab go round and round
Round and round, round and round
The wheels on the slab go round and round
Round and round, round and round
Screens in the slab fall down and down
Down and down, down and down
The screens in the slab fall down and down
Down and down, down and down

[Chorus]</pre>
