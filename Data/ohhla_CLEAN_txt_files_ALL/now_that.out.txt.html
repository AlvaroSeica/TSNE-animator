[Irfane Khan-Acito]
Now that I'm, on the road again
Got time to think about where I'm going
I couldn't think at all, now that I'm
Off and doing, faught for everything I knew and
I know, I know, you going to want, more and more and more
Now that I'm, on the road again
Got chips enough to see those cars you holding
Kid, that had the flow before
Now that I'm, free from you and
Free, from everything I've been through
I know we gonna make it
I've never been so sure

[Chorus: Irfane Khan-Acito]
Now that I'm free, you're going to hear alot from free
Now that I'm free, I'm going to ask this world for more
Now that I'm free, I'm going to make it, yes I'm sure
Now that I'm free, open your eyes so you can see
Now that I'm free, you're going to hear them things I say
Now that I'm free, I'm going to ask this world for more
Now that I'm free, I'm going to make it, yes I'm sure
Now that I'm free, watch me, watch me, fly away

[RZA]
Aiyo, I've been trapped in a bottle for years, like an ancient genie
Now I'm invading your country, like I'm Mussolini
The global furer, black gene, knowledge purer
Found the cure life in the holy Koran, first surrah
Now I'm free like the honey bee, spreading pollen
Flower the earth, with the words, that be true and solid
Find you fake funny foolish fiesty fickle faus
Sell your soul for a diamond crystal whipping house
I'm not for sale, so the devil, you can't buy me out
Protect the seeds, protect that cheese, like I'm Mighty Mouse
Here I come to save the day
Now that I'm free, I could pave the way
Out like Mandela, cut a hole from the twenty five
You in the dark, you need to step to the sunny side
It's about time you caught a sketch of my Outlines
You should worry about yours, I worry about mine

[Chorus]</pre>
