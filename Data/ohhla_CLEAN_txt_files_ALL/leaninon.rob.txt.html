[Lil' Rob] Yeah
           A little leanin' on the weekend
[Bionik]   "Oldies on the backdrop
           Playin' out the ragtop" --&gt; Lil' Rob
[Lil' Rob] A little leanin' on the weekend
           We got the
[Bionik]   "Oldies on the back" {*scratching*}
           "Playin' out the ragtop"

[Lil' Rob]
(Verse 1)
A lot of white tees and Nikes (Nikes)
A lot of oldies and nice dreams (Nice dreams)
A lot of things that reminds me (Yeah)
Of the time where you could find me
Cruisin' through my town, bumpin' Nice D's
But the jura's right behind me (Right behind me)
Park the ride and jump outside (Jump outside)
I'm from a place where the breeze comes in with the tide
And it feels right (It feels right)
I wouldn't have it any other way
Sunny in the winter
Not only on a summer day
Things would go down, and this was on the daily (On the daily)
They being shady, vatos actin' kind of crazy (Kind of crazy)
Sometimes, I can't believe that that was me (That was me)
Now it's all about taking care of family (That's right)

Chorus:
[Lil' Rob] A little leanin' on the weekend (On the weekend)
           Cruising avenues, barbecues, no matter what the season (No matter what the season)
           Hanging' out with the family and close friends (And close friends)
           Do what's right
           And always watch for dead ends (Watch for dead ends)
           A little leanin' on the weekend (On the weekend)
[Bionik]   "Oldies on the backdrop
           Playin' out the ragtop"
           A little leanin' on the weekend (On the weekend)
[Bionik]   "Oldies on the" {*scratching*}
           "Playin' out the ragtop"

(Verse 2)
My homeboy just got out the pen (Out the pen)
I feel bad
Because I never picked up a paper and a pen
To tell a friend how I was doin' (How I was doin')
And what was going on (Was going on)
Do good in my life
Tryin' to keep from doin' wrong
Tryin' to stay one step ahead, but sometimes, we fall behind
Life was on a couple times, I almost lost my mind
I didn't know how to bounce back (Bounce back)
But I did
How about that (How about that)
I'm happy now, and I'm proud to announce that (To announce that)
We gotta get our shit together (Yeah)
Can't do this shit forever
Our plan is to be livin' for the better (For the better)
And they can hate if they want to (If they want to...)
I'll be right here
Doin' what I'm supposed to

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Hittin' front and back, in a Cadillac
You might see me in a 63 (You might see me in a 63)
Hit the switch, lift it up and go
Won't you take a little trip with me
I'll see what I see
Summer breeze rustling through the trees
And there ain't no place I'd rather be (There ain't no place I'd rather be)
A little leanin' on the weekend (Weekend)
I really hope you feelin' me (I really hope you feelin' me)
Yeah

Repeat Chorus

[Lil' Rob] Yeah
           A little leanin' on the weekend (Lil' Rob)
[Bionik]   "Oldies on the backdrop
           Playin' out the ragtop"
[Lil' Rob] A little leanin' on the weekend (Bionik)
           We got the
[Bionik]   "Oldies on the back" {*scratching*}
           "Playin' out the ragtop"
[Lil' Rob] A little leanin' on the weekend (Some of that feel good music)
[Bionik]   "Oldies on the" {*scratching*}
           "Playin' out the ragtop"
[Lil' Rob] A little leanin' on the weekend (Playin' on the raptop, we got the)
[Bionik]   "Oldies on the back" {*scratching*}
           "Playin' out the ragtop"</pre>
