Mastamind..... 
Esham.... 
Natas..... 
Where ever you go 
I'll follow 
Esham..... 
Like a spirit..... 

(Mastamind) 
First you catch the slug 
Then you get yo' grave dug 
Then if ya can't remember there's a hole then fuck God with no love 
Case closed, call it a day 
They fallen in all they can say 
Is rest in peace, now let us all pray 
I'm blessed and I'm cursed 
Feel the pain, my niggas feelin' worse 
The painted bloody herse, a black chrome on the perch
Ride thru the universe, landin' on earth 
Demandin' my worth, puttin' in work, you the first jerk 
I do the day, doin' the day after midnight 
Hope you can catch some zzz, wake up get yo' shit right 
Too much in sight, wicket visionaires 
It's like all those lost souls in the streets, in the cememtaries 

I was there for the death
I'm there for the birth 
I'll be there when the meek inherit the earth 
Got yo' mind wicket 
Mastamind, reads like a spirit(2x) 

(Mastamind) 
I'm on some I don't give a fuck shit 
I don't need no love shit 
I'm goin' public wit my problems cuz I'm disgusted
Suckas tryin' to get at me, like they know me 
Niggas tryin' to do some wicket shit like they unholy 
Repentin' they sins, beg fo' forgiveness again 
Don't know the evil within, they can't even get in
You goin' against the wind, goin' against the me 
Who gone start and finish this shit from beginnin' to end 
Brothas sittin' in the pen or sittin' in the den 
Have yo' mind on that when, you lose and you win
For real 
Reads ya like a spirit 

I was there for the death 
I'm there for the birth
I'll be there when the meek inherit the earth 
Got yo' mind wicket 
Mastamind, reads ya like a spirit(3x) 

Wicket world wide 
All across this mutha fucka 
Reads ya like a spirit 
C'mon, c'mon   </pre>
