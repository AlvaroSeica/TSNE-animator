[Talking]
Shout out Future salute
I sing on these tracks
Cause I'm good at it

[Chorus]
These niggas really ain't seeing me I promise
Been paying my dues just beening honest
I'm a go hard to my last breath I promise
And I don't believe you niggas no you not honest
Just tell the truthhhhhhhhhh I keep a bunch
Of real niggas in my crew go get your money baby
I ain't mad at you they see I'm sitting at the top
I love this view it's long over due

[Verse]
When I first started these niggas said I wasn't nothing
Had no faith it's 4th down and they punting (had no faith)
I swear to God I was so low in that basement (just me)
With no money but I had a dream that I make it (I believe)
Yeah I reached out but these niggas showed no love an
Nowadays my phone filled with the plugs don't really
Trust many if we talking hoes I got plenty but I
Can't give my heart to you cause the game ain't done with me
Yeah I'm outta controlll (woah) I swear a nigga want moeee
I live in the studiooo and I'm a fucking problem
U knowww (bitch talk to em)

[Chorus]
These niggas really ain't seeing me I promise
Been paying my dues just beening honest
I'm a go hard to my last breath I promise
And I don't believe you niggas no you not honest
Just tell the truthhhhhhhhhh I keep a bunch
Of real niggas in my crew go get ya money baby
I ain't mad at you they see I'm sitting at the top
I love this view it's long over due</pre>
