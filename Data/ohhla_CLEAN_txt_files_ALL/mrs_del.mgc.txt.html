I wanna be your mrs
fill you up with kisses
you be suga daddy, I'll be mrs delicious
{*2X*}

mrs delicious beautiful like my princess
sexy like my mistress
I love your tasty biscuits
everything about this girl is fire
body like kim voice like mariah
loves to dance, even sing
baby you my wild thing
must be the way you rock that body
go ahead lil mama get naughty
stay hot like summa nights
in the club like disco lights

my sexy 3 day weekend
damn you got me tweakin

I wanna be your mrs
fill you up with kisses
you be suga daddy, I'll be mrs delicious

to that crazy way we freak

your front and your behind
you like my fantasy
my queen and satisfaction
like the playboy channel
