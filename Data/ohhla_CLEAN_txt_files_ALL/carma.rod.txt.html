['Speed Racer' sample]
We wanna inspect your car, Speed?
	Huh, but sir, the rules say any kind of car can race in the race
	So why do you have to inspect the car?
There's a good reason, Sparky
	Oh, Inspector Detector
	How are you Inspector?
Haha, glad to see you
Fifty million dollars in gold bars that were being kept
In the national bank, were stolen last week
	Yes, we read about it, sir
It's possible that someone might try to smuggle
Those bars, out of the country, sometime during the race
We won't be able to search the cars, once the race starts
So we better do it now
We can't afford to let the robbers get away with a fortune like that

[Cno Evil]
This is the PRELUDE before the STORM hits
Witness the dimmings of the lit, from the ECLIPSE
Darkness, with no fright, the King yelled "attack it's war"
Soldiers rushed in more spots, than a JAGUAR
I could of sworn I saw a SILVER GHOST, must of been my mind
Playing tricks with my eyes, I'm forced to rewind
Or it'll diminish me, I have to fight from here to INFINITI
My sword, it lives in me
They were quick to attack with the battering RAM
My men drowned from the flood that escaped out the dam
My LANDS "R" OVER, but my RANGE is far
Skilled archer, since the age of 12, causing scars
That one was a HUMMER, silent and unnoticed
Hit ACCORDingly, with ACURAcy and deep FOCUS
Hiding in the trench, a SPIDER crawled up my leg
Blood dripped off the roof's RIDGELINE, onto my head
I DODGE death, since nobody's murkin' me
They call me, quicksilver MERCURY
I'm the lord of the ring, just like SATURN
I ROLLED like a PHANTOM, since ROYCE showed me the pattern
I'm exotic like a MUSTANG, from the North American Lands
Descendent of an Arabian horse, brought here by Spanish EXPLORERS
You want war, I got war, plus 200 soldiers with their backs torned
Extended, adventerous, intellectual, spiritual QUEST
Just like the ODYSSEY, we protect with vests
We're the best, that's why we don't end up casualties
There's no need for sincerity and your flattery
I'm a CIVIC to my place of birth which I return to tonight
The INSIGHT is that we fight with all our might
So we prepare for battle, that we take under
But still our hearts stay ice cold like TUNDRA

[Chorus 2X: Li-Mouse]
It's a world of chaos, living in lies
Poisonous exhaust fumes, fill the sky
Only way to survive, is to keep above half
Choose quick routes, and avoid dangerous paths

[Li-Mouse]
The MUSTANGS couldnt keep up with the TEMPO
That lead to the THUNDERBIRDS to remain stable in the METRO
After many years, they lost thier FOCUS
Which made celebrities with BERETTAS claim to be the LOCUS
VICTORIA was CROWNED queen of the area
COOPER saw and busted out with laughs hysteria
He sent an EXPLORER to set his own version
But the NAVIGATOR failed to guide him through the EXCURSION
CARAVANS of angry VIPERS rebelled on their own ACCORD
They took LIBERTY to say the queen dies by the sword
Solar ECLIPSE block DEL SOLS SUNFIRE
The world was dark so the NEONS were up for hire
BEETLES had to run from the AVALANCHES
They took west EL CAMINOS to escape death chances
The queen didn't care in fact TRIBUTE she demanded
COUGARS liven in SUBURBAN towns were repremanded
For the years of toture from the CHEROKEES
They had feathers and deep ACCENTS, eating from berry trees
A war broke loose on PARK AVENUE it was big again
MAGNUSM ECHOED, the CROSSFIRE hit many citizens
Not one ELEMENT, was able to stop her
Even HYBRIDS who had an INSIGHT couldn't shock her
Just as when everyone was going to set up the white flag
A sound was heard, the queen went mad
It was Cooper's PROTEGE, PILOT OF THE WINDSTAR
An AVIATOR LEGEND with a LEGACY that's been far
The queen tried to shoot him down with the laser
He was to quick and hot, people called him a BLAZER
Lighting strikes and winds like a TYPHOON
Victoria finally realized she would die soon

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
