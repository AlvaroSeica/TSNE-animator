[Israel the Warrior]
straight out the gate, make 'em jump, make me bounce
break 'em down wit mo bounce to the ounce, who you be?
I'm Israel the Warrior, the chief servant
representin Heaven, breakin off all competitors
now what the deal, baby you can't see me wit a bird's-eye view
move, the crew of the Most High comin through
son it make me wanna go to combat
when I see the devil gettin busy in the world like he all that
he always got it down from the crack smoke, and the blunt smoke (??)
little kids think its cool to make they gun smoke
mama cryin, cause her son won't cooperate
and papa dyin, ain't no funds for them to operate
and check it, yo this be the last days
B grab the Word of God and read the book of Revelation in a fast way
thats the only way you'll make it, black
I been sent to you from on high to teach you immortal combat
comin through, bringin true flavor to your projects
make yo head nod til you sprain yo neck
you get the message, when the smoke clear from the wreckage
as them Holy Ghost rhymes explode on every line
like a lion I ain't scared to die, cause Jehovah Jah
uh, from the very start, gave me a lionheart

[Chorus 2x]
Israel the Warrior a.k.a. a desperado
before I got Saved I never prayed
and I'm on give regard to the Number One God
Jehovah Jah the Most High blessed me wit the lionheart
tell 'em I ready, I'm the tell them again (??)
tell 'em I ready, I'm the tell them again (??)
tell 'em I ready, I'm the tell them again (??)
Israel the Conqueror, oh yayee

[Israel the Warrior]
here we down to represent and keep it real, black
God has got my back so I can go kamikaze on the track
wit the sanctified flavor rock the mic full blown
breakin demons bones like Dragonfly Jones
west active, the Most High committed me for rappin
I'm His 4 star general, makin deals happen
one luv to the Almighty Father who made me rough enough
tough enough, to keep my head up when the goin's rough
sho nuff, through Christ I'm on conquer all things
you don't know the deal, Philippians 4:13'
I got a heart like a lion son, demons can't see me (what)
they can't beat me, so them chumps try to sneak me
no doubt, its a must I bring the flavor like that
blaze the track wit hot rhymes for the Savior like that (uh-huh)
mister tee tat toe, me rap them all in a row (oh yeah) (??)
we rock for Jehovah at the jammin show
mister tee tat toe, (oh yeah) me rap them all in a row (ah-ha) (??)
we rock for the Christians at the jammin show 

[Chorus 2x]

[Israel the Warrior]
I tell you what I do G, when adversaty come around me
and try to shut me down baby
I gots to be a strong soldier so I grits my teeth (uh-huh)
and tell satan and his team that the Saints got beef
word is bond, down to put my armor on
I'm protected to the bone as I walk with angels to the battle zone (to the battle zone)
what the deal dun, the Victory is mine
got a direct line, to the Kingdom of the Most High
what you can do son, is I can get a prayer through
if God's got my back then I can crush your crew
like Sampson, them demonic forces gettin vanquished
cuttin through your ranks in spirit, like the phantoms
sweet victory son, we got it goin on
through the midnight storm, the sun shine at the break a dawn (haa)
shouldnt a come against the Saint from the start (start)
the battle is the Lord's, so I now have a lionheart (??)

[Chorus 3x]

know I'm sayin?
we'll be comin through in 1998
know I'm sayin?
I don't know whats up yo, this ain't a rhyme for yo peeps
we be sayin, yall seein, we Christians
its a new breed a soldiers baby, with a lionheart
we comin through represntin Jehovah Jah
(and ya don't stop)
the Most High, until the day we die
(H.O.I. baby) </pre>
