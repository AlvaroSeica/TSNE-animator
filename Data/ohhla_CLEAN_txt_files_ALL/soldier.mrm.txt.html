[Samm]
Yo, what's happening?
This that nigga Samm
I got my partners D.I.G. and Mr. Marcelo up in here
ya heard me?
 
Chorus: [Samm]

Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)
Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)
 
[Samm]
I love the streets, it's just the code of it
Alot of shit go down, but look, they got more of it
To all my gangstas, that'll shank ya
In case a war, keep one in the chamber
Cause when ya aim for what your shootin' at
Kill that, boomerang should turn that two with the peel back
Crescent City nigga what?, ?? nigga what?
AK-47 weaponary beginners
On the brightest days of sunshine, it rain like storm
In the cloudy nights, you felt the sunlight from a fire arm
Only time to get ya  power on, is when the cowards gone
Ain't nothing left but a breakfast of bodies to put the flowers on

Chorus: [Samm]

Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)
Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)
Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)
Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)

[D.I.G.]
Y'all niggas keep the glocks up and pop one at any nigga who talks shit
and if he with that mouthin' off, my gun spountin' off
at all y'all, multiple murders from the poon-ta
A watchdog, ain't nothing changed, I'll still drop y'all
Just because I rap don't mean I won't beef with niggas in the street
Cause being a thug is fatigue as inside of my jeans
??? between E-Y-E 
and make sure you D-I-E, fucking with D.I.G
You looking for me?, well here I be
Strapped tight with two glocks and not afriad to shoot
Camoflagued niggas never die, now what you wanna do
Here we go again, fucking you up, you and your crew
nigga what?, nigga

Chorus: [Samm]

Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)
Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)
Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)
Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)

[Mr. Marcelo]
Soldiers and troops, about face, then ya salute
Duck when we shoot, soldiers bout it, turn on the news
Shoot from the roof, even ATF get spooked
It's understood as soon as you enter my hood
Shoot or get shot, pop or get popped, drop or get dropped
Surrounded by SWAT, murder the cops, you think not?
Could die for this knot, drive from a block
30 shot glock, infrared niggas, empty your spot
Magnolia we locked, told ya never know what will happen
Soldiers, so you know we stayed prepared for action
Project livin' with ??, for real, I'm forbidden
Hot spots, we leave 'em locked, we be money go-gettin'

Chorus: [Samm]

Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)
Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)
Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)
Camoflauged niggas never die (soldiers for life)
Fucking with them soldiers is suicide (ya heard me?)</pre>
