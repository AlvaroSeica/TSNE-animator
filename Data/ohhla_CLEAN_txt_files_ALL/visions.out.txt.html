[RZA]
I got visions in my mind, of a world of peace
Without hunger, or hate, or poverty
Where there's freedom, justice, and equality
No problems, son, the next bottle's on me
Sometimes you may see me in the '70's style
With the nappy afro and the heavenly smile
Thinking of a world with no pain
Where no man hits a woman, no woman hits a man
Vision in my head of a world with no lead
And Martin wouldn't have died from the hole in his head
The devil time is up, so pick those nines up
Pick up your books and build your mind up
It's simple as ABC, 123
I'm envisioning the world, of G-O-D
Arm Leg Leg Arm Head, Supreme head
We won't rest, until every mouth is fed

[Irfane Khan-Acito]
I've got these visions in my mind
Where I can save all of mankind
Trying to be brave, trying to be strong
Get everyone to get along
There's always something that goes wrong
I've got these visions in my mind
Where I can see, the finish line
So I run fast and I can hear
The cloud around me disappear
Old man, he whispers in my ear

[Chorus: Irfane Khan-Acito]
You keep on praying to the sky
You'll never know until you try
You keep on praying to the sky
You'll never know until you try
You keep on praying to the sky
You'll never know until you try
You keep on praying to the sun
You'll never know until it's done

[Irfane Khan-Acito]
I've got these visions in my mind
Where I can save all of mankind
Trying to be brave, trying to be strong
Get everyone to get along
There's always something that goes wrong
I've got these visions in my mind
Where I go back, way back in time
I travel sand, mountain and sea
Looking for something desperately
And then the sirens sing to me (they sing to me)

[Chorus]

[Irfane Khan-Acito]
I've got these visions in my mind...</pre>
