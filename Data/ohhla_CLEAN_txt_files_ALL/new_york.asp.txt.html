[ASAP Rocky]
Yeah, this is my story, my struggle uhh
My bittersweet symphony
My pain - check it
Food gettin lower, money comin slower
Damn landlord keep bitchin cause you owe her
I'm too afraid to grow up, I'm pray to God I blow up
And roll up in somethin foreign where the front doors go up
I wonder if my peers, could hear my prayers
The only nigga got me scared is the man upstairs
When my back against the wall I'ma face my fears
I'll swallow my pride 'fore I swallow a tear
Cause I be goin hard, Stevie on his job
I'm praying until somethin happen I'm answering to God
These wolves got me scarred, I tried so hard
to survive, guess just to prosper gotta strive
And then I hit the stage all gone and blazed
E'rybody know my name and the song I sing
I rejoice my pain and they doin the same 
And the haters gon' hate, I'm just doing my thing
Got my bad bitch with me, she so dangy
Said she love ASAP cause we so tangy
Livin life fast so I feel like kids
And I'm blowin up fast so I feel like B.I.G.
With the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
Now we doin deals with the major businesses
Get a little change niggaz feel a little strange 
Uh-oh, truck flow, pull off in the Range
Niggaz say I changed but I'm livin it up
Shit if money didn't change you you ain't gettin enough
Fuck coppin it calm, tryin to fly to the stars
Smooth on the moon and I'll be mobbin to Mars
Niggaz say I'm ill y'all ain't tellin me shit
Nights that I cried y'all ain't help me with shit
Now the money change drastic, flew through gymnastic
The doors lift up and the roof do a back flip
Zoomin through traffic, probably with a bad bitch 
slash actress and we on our way to Saks Fifth
Life was so tragic, all of that was past tense
Now I'm livin lavish, this gotta be magic

[Chorus]
If I should die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord I rest in peace
If I die before I wake
Please enjoy the songs I sing
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord I rest in peace</pre>
