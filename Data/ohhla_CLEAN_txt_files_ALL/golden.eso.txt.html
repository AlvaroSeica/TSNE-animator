Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(Yeah, check it out it goes like this yo)
It's the warmth when it's cold and it's storming
It's drifting off to the sound of rain
It's getting up kicking goals in the morning
It's lifting off from the ground with your flame
It's the strength with stand life lessons
It's the clock as the hands strike seconds
It's my movie where every memory is a colour I collect to expand my spectrum

[Verse 1]
It's the simple days, childhood here and now then it's gone in a instant
back when the wall around my world was a little to high to see beyond in the distance
it's the smell of the mint in my fresh grass, little league in the time that I'm so free
it's snow days, matachiello park with a sledge in the hills and were flying through oak trees
it's the kid who collects cards back in 91 summertime coming out the store n
it's the fact he's unrapping the pack with a smile on his dial cause he's scorin the jordan
past times I hold em dear it's maryland, virginia, bold and clear
the way the leaves on the trees in the streets would fall in the fall all to paint my golden years and yeah

[Chorus]
When the skies grey, I live off light rays
I've written every page of my lifes play
I've drawn through my eyes
I've coulored outside the lines
Tryna hold these golden years that are flashing by
When the skies grey, I live off light rays
I've written every page of my lifes play
I've drawn through my eyes
I've coloured outside the lines
Tryna hold these golden years that are flashing by

[Verse 2]
It's a bumpy road, tryna steer through the years of a genius
can't conceal what I feel and the deal is that heals are the tears from a phoenix
And I remember those days with my dad in the great outdoors
getting raised by the land, not knowing how hard life gets
call me huckelberry when I start my quest, so jump on my cloud
sit back and lounge, my wings are the size of a rich rappers house
I'll never leave so picture a viking who's memory is like christian the lion
that was me going town to town on fire works night you couldn't count me out
my mates older brothers had a hundred of the bungas
take cover cause' we nearly burnt down the house
I remember when they took away my wu-tang
sittin' there till the bell of my school rang
playing pool on the pool where the rules are abused
my adventure the the centre where the youth hang
and grandma's we'd visit every journey
a living room stage where I'd mimic Eddie Murphy or Kid'n'Play
and play delirious so damn much they couldn't take me serious

[Chorus]
When the skies grey, I live off light rays
I've written every page of my lifes play
I've drawn through my eyes
I've coulored outside the lines
Tryna hold these golden years that are flashing by
When the skies grey, I live off light rays
I've written every page of my lifes play
I've drawn through my eyes
I've coloured outside the lines
Tryna hold these golden years that are flashing by</pre>
