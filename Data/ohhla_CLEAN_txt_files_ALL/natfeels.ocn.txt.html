[Intro]
Yeah
Ow ow, yeah

[Frank Ocean]
I've been meanin to fuck you in the garden
Been breathin so hard, we both could use the oxygen
Just hop on my back, I'll take you down the stairs
Into my backyard then lay you out on the grass

[Chorus]
Give it you over again, over again over again
Over again over again, over again over again
Makin love, underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
Say oh baby (oh baby) up against the cherry tree (boy)
Baby girl (baby baby baby) I'll give it to you naturally

[Frank Ocean]
Feelin like Adam when he first found out this existed (uhh, WOW~!)
Me and my Eve tryin out our first positions (heh, yeah)
And it's all good, and it's all free
And it's all you, and it's only me
Playin in the dirt, wrestlin myself inside you
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
My cavewoman, I'm a caveman
Doing wild things, in a wild land
We keep goin baby, we keep gettin it baby
We'll get Pebbles maybe, a couple Bam Bams
Bam bam, bang bang
Girl your heart, goes, bam and bang
Feel my heart go, go, go
