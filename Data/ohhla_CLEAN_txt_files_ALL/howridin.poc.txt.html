Chorus: Coyote
You all know how we ridin'
We came to make you move
Fuck with all to prove
No matter what hood you reside in
This is how we do, man
We got a new plan
You all know how we ridin'
We came to make you move
Fuck with all to prove
No matter what hood you reside in

[Coyote]
Coyote from the Golden State
Get it straight

(Verse 1)
Let me break it down
I represent my town
Coyote's in the house, put it down, how we get down
G's in the mix, homies, homies, look around
Downtown, brown town, put it down for the brown
Shoop, shoop, shooter, cruise
Pocos Pero Locos
5150
Crazy on the vocals
Lowride, homie, west coast to the east coast
You know how we do, Latin peeps on the move
How to have a piece, so we had to make a move
And it's all good, yeah, from our hood to your hood
Up, blowin' up, like we knew we would, yeah
Holla at your boy, make ya say, "God damn!"
Man, oh man, big things, that's the plan
What's up with these eses, homies on, be checkin'
Til the wheels fall off, holmes
Jura, jura, pusha
Trucha
Locos en carusha

Repeat Chorus

[Lucky Luciano]
Dirty dirt
Hold up
Hun

(Verse 2)
Let me show ya how I do, sittin' on 22's
I'm passin' by the schools, with my music on Screw
Cuffed here to the rim, I'm a show my gold grin
Baby, have you ever seen a candy red Benz?
Tippin' on Swangers
Four cliffhanger
Arm out the window, flashlight on my finger
Pinky ring sunny, I smell like money
Listen to the front row, screaming "I'm Lucky
Luciano, playa made vato"
Can't keep it on the shelf, when my tape hit the store
Got the H-Town gang, nothin' less than the best
How I walk, how I talk, how I dress with finesse
2006, poppin' bottles of Cris
Pour it out on the floor, cause I'm ballin' in the mix
I'm a send my bitch, have her slide down the pole
Tell her count the money out, when I pull up at the door

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Ark]
Some are Pocos Pero Locos, leave the vatos actin' babo
Keep y'all niggas on your toes like some tacos, kinda flaco
Little skinny, bet a plenty, if I had a penny for the many
Niggas actin' petty, y'all already be rich
In the doors, see y'all flippin' the flow, Ark kick the shit
Left like a flick of the stove
Listen
I name what the game is and bet I ain't with you
You can find me in the Range, lane switchin'

[Psalmz]
It's not where you from, it's where you stand
One wave of the hand
Might give me 25 in the can
Search
And you find, I put work in my lines, while your radio
Pumps out nursery rhymes
I write life
For my pania, tryin' to feed my bilega
Cause me being broke, eso no combina
Gonna bring rap back
Before I'm gone
Wherever I lay my hat
Well, that's my home

[IzReal]
It's T-Weaponz, the New York Rican east coast thugs
Where we still get Chicano, Latino love
Ya tu sabe, without you, there be no us
No name in lights on Vegas, casino buzz
And we rep for the black and Latino slums (Fa' sho)
New York o L.A., you still see those guns
They be angry
Cause they know that he's all buzz
He's alright, but he's no us

Repeat Chorus</pre>
