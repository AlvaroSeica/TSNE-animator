[Chorus: Bingo Players' "Cry (Just a Little)"] w/ Flo Rida
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Flo Rida]
Know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimmin like a diver
Can't let go I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better but the killer was a coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
The other moment got me feelin like a lemonhead
Put you in a box, just the President's cigarettes
Give 'em my regards, or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried 'bout the killers just the young and restless
Get mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI, never said I was drivin reckless
You and I, but the jealously is not oppressive
Oh no I can't stop, I was destined

[Chorus] - 2X (second time dub)

[Flo Rida]
Champagne buckets, still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get depressed, but the outfit all in it
Cause the press tell it all, get a meal ticket
Clean next, get the call, just a lil' visit
Sacrifice just to make the hit still vivid
Reality doin your best just to kill critics
Bugatti never been the rich, just God fearin
Look at me steerin, got the broads starin
Got a good feeling, as the ride carryin
Tellin Billie Jean, I'm on another planet
Thank Class, Big Chuck, and leave Prince Paris
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears damn it
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryin to live, tryin to figure how your sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic

[Chorus] - 2X (second time dub)

[repeat 4X]
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun comin down, I know it's all better now

[Chorus] - 2X (dub version)</pre>
