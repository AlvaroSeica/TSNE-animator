[Chorus 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
We all gon' die and we all gon' be judged
Some'll see the gates, the handcuffs and the slugs
The number one, who can play me for a thug
We never show thy enemies love

[Hook: Shabazz the Disciple]
Never show thy enemies love
Never show thy enemies love

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Let me tell you a little story, about this snake named David
Whenever he seen niggas getting rich, he's always hating
His name ain't the chosen apostle for his apparel
His next thing mental jewels, and learning we burn aloe
He try to convince the projects, storm me from a barrel
While they witness, building the treasure city for the pharaoh
Took the witness stand, for ten talents of gold
Sold his soul, fear his life, no chances for parole
Was another short story about this dude name Jude
Seen him scarred by my mans, his neck placed it like these
He always set up the table with Christ and his disciples
You can see that look in his eyes that they don't like you
Always seen him in the hood, congregating with them Romans
The only nigga that never got indictment, during the plague of bones
He ain't trying to see you doing good, he'd rather see you buried
My beloved in the hood, these are our advisaries

[Hook 2X]

[Chorus 2X]

Let me tell you another parable about this king named David
His own blood admire with envy, cuz he's God's favorite
He always taught you how to understand all of life's lessons
But all they did was use and tuck and steal all his posessions
They must of loved watching the indudstry getting niggas there
Cuz after all they seen, they did the same thing that angels did
Rap celeb, divisions with blood, I learned from the streets
Cuz the families do once, you get the knife and the heat
Let me tell you another parable, about this sloth named Saul
He was blood from a different cloth, wanted to see David fall
He got David arrested, confiscated all the merchandise
And he done seen a bigger picture, though he came up with the perfect heist
One night he seen a red moon and the angels run up on 'em
David caught a premonition, man, he tried to warn 'em
Since Saul wasn't living right, he was supposed to die tonight
But since David was in the car too, Allah spared his life
Two days later, Saul robbed David again
And had to answer Allah, to pay him back the rages of all his sins

[Hook 2X]

[Chorus 2X]
