Brother Li...

[Li-Mouse]
Feel the heat from the streets, I gotta eat
Kid with the Copper Arms, listen when I speak
A freak on the mic, never cheat the beat
We walk as two, but have the strength of a fleet
By all means, we ain't no saints
In B.C., I was rocking black Egyptian paints
I walk around with charisma like a Pharaoh
Overthrowing me, chances, slim, narrow
Your crew might deep, but ya'll still shallow
And my, voice carries heavy like a wheelbarrow
I write in the dark with a can of Pepsi
When I emerge, only the fools wanna test me
I'm grumpy, grouchy, you can't live without me
Listen to The Rodentz find out all about Li
Mouse, still on the prowl for the top spouse
Spit downpours like rain, I douse
You acknowledge, shit obtain from college
Rhyming for days, high mileage
But still I run it strong for mad long
Vibrate the sound waves, bang on the gong

[Chorus 2X: Li-Mouse]
You trapped in this rap and the world bizarre
And ya, hit pretty hard in the city of frauds
Uplift the mind and join the Rodent cause
Cuz wrist pullers small, we all shining stars

[Li-Mouse]
Verse two, now feel lucky that you're the first to
Figure out why my first thought is to hurt you
Everybody all concerned about their money
Even if they got a lot, still they take from me
It ain't my fault, I, do things better
The way I build words, navigate the letters
Forming what is now known as Rodent music
I don't do this, because you should choose it
I rather because you know you can use it
Listening to us, guaranteed you won't lose it
You damn right we did it, you damn right we spit it
Intrigued by the drum, the dumb don't get it
Don't forget it, the name is Mouse with a Li
Fucking eardrums up for fee or free
Uh-huh, that's the way I'm gonna end it
Rodentz, bitch, forever, I will defend it

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
