(Mr. Shadow)
Somebody needs to tell all these dedicated wannabes
Were making grown men cry when you fuck with these
I ain't here to please any fluke
I came to bring pain squeeze the trigger and shoot
Who you hang with is who you are
And you ain't around us so fuck you all mutha fuckaz
Tall grass cause you's a snake
You're an old broke bitch looking for something to take
Make your move who fucked who? Think about it, Huh
You fucked yourself dumb fag don't doubt it
Listen to the young and rowdy gang officials
Fool you know the name shadow, Lil and Vicious
The bitch list is ah getting ridiculous
And you bitches are getting killed for this
I'm in this shit till my casket closes
Till I die you and the whole world know this

(Hook)(2x)
I'm in this shit
Gangster trips that'll make you cock your glock and pop those who saw
I'm in this shit
Getting kicks from the crooked cops who block when we slaying them rocks
I'm in this shit
Gangster trips that'll make you cock your glock and pop those who talk
I'm in this shit
Getting kicks from the crooked cops who block when we slaying them rocks

(Mr. Lil One)
Mobbing through the vocals and having Havoc in the smog
I been thinking about your ways and I been thinking about the wrongs
Why you tripping motherfucker you my niggero right?
It don't matter when we gather we inseparable right?
You been acting kinda strange what you think I need a change?
What'chu jealous of my name? All the envy and the fame
I'm the same mutha fucka that you met back in the day
Call me little call me uno call me Ray ??? 
Have your bitch all on my nuts have since way back but fuck that
I let that bitch alone straight drooling on my bone
You should recognized your wife stay away from all the lies
You should open up your mind try to vibe and try to find
A way to run-a-way and escape all the stress
A way to get-a-way from all that hate in your chest
I'd rather be alone than emitting fools with me
Somebody pull the chrome they evacuate me quickly

(Hook)

(Mr. Shadow)
I close the walls in on ya, Make you claustrophobic
Till you can't breath so take your last breath and hold it
Phony ass character oval still amateur
Never in your life will you reach my caliber
Cannabis tibia got me tripping
Knowing one day I'ma catch your ass slipping
Until then I'ma let you keep talking
See you on the streets we'll see who leaves walking</pre>
