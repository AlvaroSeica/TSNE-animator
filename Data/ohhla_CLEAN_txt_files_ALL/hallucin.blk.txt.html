Typed by: Hatt's Crib

[Chorus]
I'm losing my mind they say
And I'm starting to believe it sometimes
I hallucinate and I don't know what I'm seeing
Is it my mind playing tricks on me?
Or the drugs they insist I take
I don't know what's truth or fake
Yo who's to say as I hallucinate

[Verse 1]
They came and got me at like three in the morning
Woke me up from a dream that I was screaming and falling
They snatched me up from my slumber, tatted me with a number
And barcode scanned me, and bagged me up like cucumbers
Six spies, men in black disguised with my wrists tied in twist ties
They told me about the fish eye lenses in the big sky
Eagle eye watch me, talking about how this fly demon type Nazis
Illuminati's got me trying to pop me like the paparazzi
Did Princess Di, guess it's a crime to feed your stimuli
And I would wish these guys had bigger fish to fry
Than an underground nigga trying to help you see the visual
Lies they project like hallucinations
Like claiming you gaining freedom while we lose the nation
They lying when they told you the war's over
Truth is dying like our soldiers, reality's in the eye of the beholder

[Chorus]
I'm losing my mind they say
And I'm starting to believe it sometimes
I hallucinate and I don't know what I'm seeing
Is it my mind playing tricks on me?
Or the drugs they insist I take
I don't know what's truth or fake
Yo who's to say as I hallucinate

[Verse 2]
Six months later I was free from the hole
They been feeding me drugs deep in my soul seeking control
And sensory deprivation got me weak in the soul
Got me questioning what is real, I feel the Reaper is close
They try to tell me what I'm seeing is ghost
And when the demons approach
It's a byproduct of the weed and the coke
Wish they'd leave me alone, but I'm a prisoner really
Of my own beliefs, Mel Gibson in Conspiracy Theory
And I'm fucking wilding, am I bugging in this nut asylum?
Like Leonardo DiCaprio on Shutter Island
I want to live a life of liberty and righteousness
They trying to enslave me implant me with the microchip
For pete's sake we living in a police state
We got to teach the children and help them see straight
Orderlies on drugs, disorderly conduct
Abuse the patients, is this real or a hallucination?

[Chorus]
I'm losing my mind they say
And I'm starting to believe it sometimes
I hallucinate and I don't know what I'm seeing
Is it my mind playing tricks on me?
Or the drugs they insist I take
I don't know what's truth or fake
Yo who's to say as I hallucinate

[Outro]
Don't believe what you're seeing
I'mma try to be the one that leads you
Don't listen to them demons
And looking forward to the drugs they feed you

It's a worldwide ?
You are God, there's no Heaven above

It's a worldwide ?
