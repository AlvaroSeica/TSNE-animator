mow when I rhyme up on this microphone, felling the b
killing me softly
leaving a trace for things to see
tell me why do I got these things on my mnd
man this 909, circle is built
nigga understand either way the game rolls
shit will deal
putting knowledge straight into the dome, so going home to the source
or angels order
oh u trippin, I gots to mention shit I got a visoon
I m making it to the top
and those guys get to popping and it starts fading
tell me what should I do cuz
I been to this game, so what
and deeply I look up to the sun and I know
and for some reason its like treason of knowledge
and I think damn,
I'm only 19
now whats gonna happen when I'm 26
whi I'm gon be and what is my purpose
its like a mind game
get it on my mind brain
its all a game, word.
I see the big picture now
but how it suppose to be , mix it down
sight and sound, lost parallel
the mind and body, life is nothing but a fairy tale
no time to find a hobby
I'm a bomber from the heart
I keep it fresh withought the additives
new on the scene with no pull so I have to give
knew what I wanted, started building from the ground up
