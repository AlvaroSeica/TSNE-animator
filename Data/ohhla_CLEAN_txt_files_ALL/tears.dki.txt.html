A September morning life didnt seem the way it should be
I was just mourning, thinking of all the wrong that was done to me, 
now check it
Sitting on my door step thinking with my head down
Alone in my own world with no one left around
Then out of nowhere comes my partner Majesty, asking me 
"Yo, Iz why you look like theres been a Tradegy"
Remember the girl from down the block that i was check out?
I was on my way to her house sippin' on a Guiness Stout
Looking jazzy like ya dont know, my jewels were daggling
you can see it on the steering wheel of my Volvo
I wanted to catch a flick and thats all
Sarafina, heard it was playing at King Plaza Mall
Had bad vibes before I got to her crib
But when i did, seen her talking to this light skinned kid..
check it out
It's something that I so despise
Faking moves on the mind of a fool
brings tears to my eyes

Don't cry, don't cry, bring tears to my eyes, 
Don't cry don't cry...
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry...

Help her out the ride slam the door, press the alarm, is it on?
Its time to drop the bomb, but remain calm
Should I bring it up or should I just wait?
For her to kick it, dig it, 
she was out to get it like Gidget, I figured
Then I asked "Whos the kid that left your pad?"
Oh, hes a friend of mine, I met him at the study lab, in school
Sounds like the typical, mythical, mystical line
Use my  line, but you cant trick me hoe
Then she said she wouldnt let it happen again
He came to the crib to help her out, so she had to let him in
Sho ya right, hes coming in the day, but he's leaving at night (uh huh)
Mama told me they'll be girls like these I said please
I spent money like it grew on tree leaves
It's something that I so so despise
Faking moves on the mind of a fool
brings tears to my eyes

Don't cry, don't cry, bring tears to my eyes
Don't cry don't cry...
Don't cry, don't cry, dont cry...

Another twenty minutes passed, then the phone rang
I picked it up and said "Hello" 
and then her friend asked "Who is this James?"
Naw, this is Izzy and I dont recall having my name changed
And by the way who is this? ya bear witness, get this
If you were here I'll probably hit you with my Guiness (Stout)
Hung up the phone and got crazy, cause the woman I called my lady
Was playing a role like Patrick Swayze
I just left like a real man should, didnt argue a bit, 
feeling real damn good
I heard the brothers say it doesnt pay to be faithful
I learned my lesson that day, and i'm grateful
But i cant face my future or my past
Its hard keeping caution, at the same time watching my cash
Making sure that I dont spend an extra buck, she flipped the script
Mister "all that" got fucked, knee deep
Its something that I so despise
Faking moves on a mind of a fool
brings tears to my eyes...

Don't cry, don't cry... what a way to go out
Don't cry, don't cry... it's kinda...
Don't cry... man
It's gonna be alright...
Don't cry... yeah...
bring tears to my eyes...
ha... yeah... ha
and we out...</pre>
