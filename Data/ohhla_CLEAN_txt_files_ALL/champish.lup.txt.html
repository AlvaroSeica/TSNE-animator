[Chorus]
The champ is here

[Verse 1]
Flow can't be seen
Like it took one in the face
I'm heavy nigga, tow can't be seen
Like I'm repossessing a Chevy nigga
Don't hang with those niggas those cant be safe
Even in they panic rooms
I will soon be forest to the floor of this
Stethoscope to the door of it
Listenin for the break
And I don't care how long gettin the combination takes
I be concentrating on the crack, get it straight
I was so high up the food chain that which I mentioned before
I ain't know how to make
I master shake like Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Already number 1 in the hood G
It's like my third deal off Could Be
Get it focused, one of the coldest you gonna run across
Like it was stolen from a under boss
Spent for stack and sold to another boy
He might never get it back
So whoever got it gettin' whacked if they ever get caught
Now that's what I call reaction to a chain snatchin
Game got 'bout as much compassion as The Passion
So it gotta make a comeback, just like a champion

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I run it back to that last piece of action
My necklace was took-en by detective
I don't stress it I just gather up my essence
As real as the view through my Cartier correctives, yeah
But now back to the punchin
Back to floor/flow like crunchin
Got a 6 pack on the low now I'm sunk in
Look like I'm driving from the back seat
With a bird shotgun like I'm huntin
You see what happened
I made a call, and she got fly
I was pumping, hit her up
Then I sent my dog to go and pick her up
Camouflaged fitted cut to the left velours, how I did it up
And to the whole Westside, I tip it up
And over to the single baby momma wit no job that gotta WIC it up
To all my niggas in the CCDOC waiting on they quick collect to come
So they can live it up
And to my niggas that liquor they livers up and distribute cut in the belly
Sit it up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In the abdomen is Madison from which I came
But this my gang
FNF crew, first and fifteen
Bear arms like Lebat Blue
Oh yes its bullets in the toasters as many as the clips that the gun hold
And they itchin to come up out the magazine like the posters that unfold
So my heat like Tigerbeat
I got the shotgun in the driver's seat
So if Lupe's a coupe, my man is a sedan
If there's more than 2 of us, then you up against a van
If I'm leavin, then you leavin
If your niggas wanna come, y'all can ride with me
It's just gonna be a lot of squeezin
Ya understand?
That I don't need Caroline calculator to divide defeat
Just lean a little closer
The flows are his as roses is
So override your pride and decide retreat
It's suicide to me
Like a broke stock broker and a sidewalk
Y'all niggas ain't fly as me
That's why I defy physics and y'all niggas collidin, peace
I'm up here with the Leers
Y'all down down there with the airs
Emperors in the mirror, you're playing with a pair
Nigga I is we
Twice the MC like mc-squared
Trust, I make it relate
I got the poker-face and I'm hiding a flush
Still riding the beat
With a air that still smells like roses from Andre 3000
My housing surroundings is what made me me
And that's two times the G
You see how I doubled that the third time, nigga please
