[Intro: Kirko Bangz]
Young and I'm gettin' it, young and I'm gettin' it
Young and I'm gettin' it, I'm just young and I'm living, shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches
Cause I'm young and I'm gettin' it, I'm young and I'm gettin' it

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz] + (Meek Mill)
Okay I wake up in the morning, and I see dollar signs (stacks)
And, shawty wanna roll and I'm like oh man she fine (facts)
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine (yeah)
So why you hatin' on me? (Yeah) hah, I'm just livin' my life (turn up)
I'm just young and I'm gettin' it (work) young and I'm gettin' it (work)
Young and I'm gettin' it (work) I'm just young and I don't give a shit (work)
I just want the money (work) y'all can keep them bitches (work)
Cause I'm young and I'm gettin' it (work) I'm young and I'm gettin' it

[Meek Mill]
Yeah, young nigga I get money and fuck hoes on my spare time (woo!)
She don't fuck on the first night, then she don't meet my deadline (woo!)
Niggas smokin' that Bob Marley, that Bob Marley like "Yea Mon"
I'm sippin' on the whole eighth of the purp shit -- bed time
I cop foreigns like Jordan's (Jordan's) y'all niggas ain't important ('portant)
Shawty want that molly (molly) and I'ma get what she order (order)
Tats all on my body (body) strapped up like a war (war)
Eat the pussy I prolly (prolly) if it smell like water (water)
Her neck talk say "fuck me", my wrist talk say "suck me"
These niggas claimin' they ballin', I take your bitch, Kris Humphries
And make them buy me a whip nigga, nothin' less than the 6 nigga
Y'all ran your mouth like hoes, all y'all some bitch niggas

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Okay, your baby mama: I bought that (check) side chick: I bought that (check)
Main chick: I bought that (check) and your dream girl just called back (hah)
I'm still repping that north side with that big P on my ballcap
These broke niggas don't like me, cause they say I think I'm all that
Now Coon cop that 'rarri (rarri) I don't even feel salty (salty)
Niggas claimin' my flows (flows) I should put these niggas on Maury (Maury)
And I ain't claimin' these hoes (hoes) have these haters looking all salty (salty)
When I pulled up in that Rolls (Rolls) swag was surfin' on 'em like gnarley (gnarley)
I'm with 3 hoes like Santa Claus, and I'm the boss, Diana Ross
Hit you girl by mistake nigga, wasn't even in my plan at all
I told homie I hit it there, this nigga wanna be playin' it off
Knowin' that girl is main thang, that shit don't like nigga - bang bang!

[Chorus] + [Intro]</pre>
