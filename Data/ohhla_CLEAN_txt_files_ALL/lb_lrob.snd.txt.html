[Intro]
Hooo. Weeee. Jaaaa. Hi-ja. Kung fu. Karate. Tae Kwon Do
Tai Chi. Tae Bo. That other shit that they did in that movie
what was it called I can't remember?
Um, Capoeira, that's what I'm talkin' about. Check it out

[Chorus] [x2]
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt (Lightening bolt)
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt (Lightening rod)
Lightening rod, lightening rod, lightening, lightening rod

[Verse One]
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt
You can see, this is not, simply any old
Type of flow, type of song, I done taken hold
Of a lightening rod, lightening rod, lightening, lightening rod
Homeboy Sand, journey man, travel place to place
Out of range, out of state, even outerspace
In Japan, pretty ma's say Konnichiwa
To the lightening rod, twisted of Kirin Ichiban
Lightening rods, lightening bolts
Racin' through the sky
Some are his, some are hers
Most of them are mine
? ill with the scratch, need some Calmine
Me and mine, fresh and clean, strictly sanitized
Everywhere that I go, people always ask
Have any enemies taken you to task?
I reply, "No indeed. That be very odd."
I'm a lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening rod

[Chorus] [x2]
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt (Lightening bolt)
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt (Lightening rod)
Lightening rod, lightening rod, lightening, lightening rod

[Verse Two]
Lightening rod
Lightening, lightening bold
Let me lighten your load
I eat bowls of lightening bolts, Ã  la mode
Make my bones with witches and trolls
Now I...
Build bridges and...
Pitch fishes and loaves
My britches low, my britches got a bulge
I will divulge when you and I alone
I lightening Thunder Cats call me Lion O
Say hello to my little friend
My little foes lookin' nervous as I step upon the scene
For you may causality, please pardon me
Weather man puzzled by how long the lightening lasts
Thunder clap, lightening bolt, bolts of lightening flash
Radio, there they go, playin' a load of crap
Do not sweat, do not fret, let me handle that
Sandman knows centerfolds, hope to get it on
With the light skin tone, lightening bolt
Lightening rod

[Chorus] [x2]
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt (Lightening bolt)
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt (Lightening rod)
Lightening rod, lightening rod, lightening, lightening rod

[Verse Three]
Lightening rod, lightening rod, lightening lightening bolt
I got loads of flows for whatever floats your boat
I pimp prose that sounds sweeter than a Toblerone 
Easy as a Sunday morn
So once you grab a hold don't let go
For the love of doe is not why I compose
And I'm down for going blow for blow if that's what you propose
I got X amount of soldiers in my Motorola phone
Let me also make it known
I'd much prefer being am-icable
Lightening bolt, lightening rod

If you'd like to get involved
Fireball dialog
By and large
Infinity and beyond
I quit PNBR
Y'all busy wondering, "What do he be on?"
Trying to find a category into which he belong
But be warned
That will take very long
No part Babylon
Often overhead
Part carry-on
Part Megatron
Part vagabond
All lightening bolt
All lightening rod

[Chorus] [x2]
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt (Lightening bolt)
Lightening bolt, lightening bolt, lightening, lightening bolt (Lightening rod)
Lightening rod, lightening rod, lightening, lightening rod</pre>
