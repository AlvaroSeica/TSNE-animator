RoRoRoRock then bend my knees, every time the beat drop

RoRoRoRock then bend my knees, every time the beat drop

You know pimpin make the beat drop, fuckin with a laptop
I make em do it do it, as soon as the beat drop
Might throw my towels out like Nick I like to wild out
I'mma stay in the game until I fall out
First I lean grab a ball and then I pop wit it (I pop wit it)
When they bring the mics the crowd I roc wit it (I rock wit it)
I never hind licks, trying to get it quick
When the songs come on they, like that's my shit

1-     [Monica]
        I can't help who I'm is, when they play my shh
        I just love to dance, every time the beat drop
        I love to wild out damn right, shake it all night
        Hey that's my jam, every time the beat drop
        I said UH, all the ladies in the club grab a dude
        And you work it real slow, you can do it
        Move it, till you make him lose it
        RoRoRoRock then bend my knees, every time the beat drop
        He gon' be a fan, every time the beat drop

I know you used to seeing Mo laid back
So for the most part you think I'm like that (dig this)
You about to get a glimpse of the fit
I'm givin niggas on the floor man 
When I hit the door man
Cause I ain't one of these too bourgeois broads
Always in the club holding up the wall (now dig this)
You about to get a taste of the way 
That we do it down here in the A
Let me say

Repeat 1

[Monica]
Now I ain't talking bout a little two step
I'm talking bout some that'll make you sweat
And when I talk well I'm through talking
I'm about to do some move some let you see something
When I say get gutta it's enough said
Do the bounce like you over on Bank head
And if anybody got a problem with the way you doin you
Look em dead in the face and you say

Repeat 1

[DFB]
I trick stats like killers and I blow that money
I'm drunk off the goose so I throw that money
I spill white T cash, yall at to bag money
When I step off in this spot like I know there's money
And my chain so ...., how colors diamonds you need man
I bow low we, you wanna bow low in the week-end
Damn! And he ain't fresh azimiz
It's DFB bitch, and I can, I can

Repeat 1</pre>
