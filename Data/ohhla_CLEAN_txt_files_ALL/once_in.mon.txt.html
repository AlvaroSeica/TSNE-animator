[Max B Speaking]

[Chorus x2: Kanye West sample]
It's what ya all been waitin for
It's what ya all been waitin for
It's what ya all been waitin for, ain't it?
What people payin paper for?

[Chorus x2: French Montana]
Murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line
Murder was the case that they gave me

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Getting shot up, then he got up
Came back then he lit the spot up
Homie hit the chart up
Moroccan boy, you sloppy boy
3 chains on, I be Rocky boy
Packs out the lobby boy
Nigga you can read on, each dream on
French, got my feet on
With money I can lean on
Canary chain cold but still keep the heat on
Your bitch with the raccoon vest, Peter Pete on
Catch me at the game, hard wood where my feet on
Lookin for an actress on my wood I could skeet on
Mansion on the other hand, live from the mother land
2 straps on, east side where you rumbling

[Chorus x2: French Montana]
Murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line
Murder was the case that they gave me

[Chorus x2: Kanye West sample]
It's what ya all been waitin for
It's what ya all been waitin for
It's what ya all been waitin for, ain't it?
What people payin paper for?

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Alfred Hitchcock, two [?] fist fight
Caught a nigga slippin for his chain and his wrist watch
Murder was the case that they gave me
I can't believe my boo bout to have my baby
Uh, you out of luck, mercedes truck
Pull up, distance, shoot better [?]
Ducking from the knocks, Elz near Crotona park
Out of control, now a nigga go control him up
Shoot outs and move out, ask to break last
9th floor seats, talkin to the bench players
Tell the mic baby, it's my city
Lead the game, hit green house, me and Diddy

[Chorus x4: French Montana]
Murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line
Murder was the case that they gave me

[Chorus: Kanye West sample]
It's what ya all been waitin for
It's what ya all been waitin for
It's what ya all been waitin for, ain't it?
What people payin paper for?</pre>
