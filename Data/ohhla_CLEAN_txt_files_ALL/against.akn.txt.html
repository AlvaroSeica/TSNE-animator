[Akon]
So soft and slow
Never knew a girl could be so goddamn cold, I know
The way she move got me spendin my dough and yo
If you would have seen what I seen on that pole, just know
 
[Bridge 1: Akon]
That I was wrong for fallin in love (love)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a hoe)
Said I was wrong for fallin in love (lovedon't do it yo)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a hoe)
But I just went against the grain
 
[Chorus]
It was a feelin I can't explain, and it felt like harmony
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it around me everyday
Singin in my face like dee-dee-da-di-do-da-de
 
[Ray Lavender]
Look at me, I'm stuck
The bubble in her pants got me caught up, I never had no luck
Thinkin with the wrong head got me jumpin that now with no glove
It feels so good it had me sprung out on that stuff, now I'm stuck
 
[Bridge 2: Ray Lavender]
That's what I get for fallin in love (love)
That's what I get for fallin in love (they always said don't love a hoe)
That's what I get for fallin in love (lovedon't do it yo)
That's what I get for fallin in love (they always said don't love a hoe)
(Akon) But I just went against the grain
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Akon]
So thick, so raw
That oil all over her body stole my heart, I'm cold
The way she dropped down won't allow me to close my jaw, 'cause I'm
Already in love and I knew better from the start, oh no
 
[Bridge 3: Akon]
I was wrong for fallin in love (love)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a hoe)
Said I was wrong for fallin in love (lovedon't do it yo)
I was wrong for fallin in love (they always said don't love a hoe)
But I just went against the grain
 
[Chorus]- repeat 2x
