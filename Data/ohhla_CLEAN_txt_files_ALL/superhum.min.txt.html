Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Come you sinners poor and needy
Weak and wounded, sick and sore
Jesus ready stands to save you
Grace requires nothing more
I will arise and go to Jesus
He will embrace me in His arms
In the arms of my dear Savior
There are ten thousands charms

Why is it every time I step up on a train
I see a pretty dame and I wonder what her name is
for' I even get there the question on my brain is
do you love the Lord do you live to make Him famous?
then the cart stop, she step off, it's time to refocus
I'm questioning my heart, examining my motives
why I'm captivated by the brown skin mocha divas
and I hope in my mind she's a believer
ok, she got all that beauty yea it's obvious
I can't let it take precedence over Godliness
now I'm getting restless
how I'm recognizing when I'm choosing to take pleasure in all these false treasures
they fools gold
instead of looking for them sundresses
I should be looking for the Son I confess it
even though my prides telling me don't let the fans know
I am not a superhuman though
I am a man
so the grace that I talk about on all my records
I need it for myself, cause really I'm just a mess
finding rest from the pressures of perfection
as I stand up on this platform they expectin
me to be a man without flaws, that's false
I am just another rapper that's called to point ya'll to the cross
and that's exactly where I'm headed
I'm just another beggar pointin ya'll to where the bread is
maaan

I'm not a superhuman
I am just a man
No, I'm not a superhuman
I am just a man
I'm not a superhuman
I am just a man, but they never understand

I'm nothing more than a man lost, dead in my sin
So here I am alive in Your hands
Your hands, Your hands

We dress up in nice heels, we try to make people buy'em
that's why when someone ask how we doin, we tell'em fine
knowing we hurt inside, but tell me who's really lyin
they ain't really wanna know how you doin, that cost time
that's way too expensive
and if I ever get a date with a dime I'm sending my representative
the version of Andy that's cropped and edited
I'm killin this first impression, and I'm hidin the evidence
Yea, photoshoppin the blemishes
these lies of perfection are the cry of the desperate
men that want that acceptance
holdin they breath, dyin a thousand deaths
forgettin there's beauty inside the mess
what else could you expect? we obsessed over twitter numbers
checkin ours, then comparing them to others, like
the number of likes upon a status is somehow suppose to raise our status
boy, this is madness
we want the trophy wife who's the baddest and not some average
so we can feel like the man, Randy Savage
take me off the shelf, I don't wanna be for retail
I would rather be real, let you see the details
when we fell, it feels like we fall so far cause they put us so high
I am not a star
I'm just a product of grace that's still in the process
and I don't gotta be great, because my God is

and I don't gotta be great, because my God is
I'm just a product of grace and guess what?
I'm still in the process, there's unfinished business

Would you love me if I told you I couldn't fly?
I got no cape on and no mask on there's no disguise
Oh I'm no hero
There's only one
Oh I'm no hero
There's only one
and He's not for sale

I'm not a superhuman
I am just a man
No, I'm not a superhuman
I am just a man
I'm not a superhuman
I am just a man, but they never understand

I'm nothing more than a man lost, dead in my sin
So here I am alive in Your hands
Your hands, Your hands</pre>
