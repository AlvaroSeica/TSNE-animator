[Afrika Bambaataa]
In the name of the force who is the source who is called by many names
Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Elohim, Jah, El Nu, El Kuluwm, The All
And as we give praise to the creator
and we give praise for all you human beings
who's down here on this planet, so-called Earth
And to all the extraterrestrial beings
in other planets and other places and other dimensions
throughout our universe of universes
I greet all of y'all with the greetings words of PEACE... {*echoes*}</pre>
