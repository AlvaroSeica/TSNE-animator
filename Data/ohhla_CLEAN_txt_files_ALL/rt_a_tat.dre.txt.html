we gotta get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and then start

Once again 
the mighty Death Row organization commitin' mass murder 
and we ain't askin for shit, nigga we takin' 
it, so Dre, BLAST they ass nigga 
Rat-tat-tat-tat late at night with my gat 
on the streets of LA 
wonderin' where the pussy at 
staright for ya, looking for a hoe 
hangin' out, rollin in my '64 
16 swicthes for the niggaz in my hood 
17 shells so i make it understood 
stay back, lay back, way back in the cut 
ya come outside nigga ya gettin' fucked up 
but i told ya, Creep, Creep ya best move 
like Luthor Vadros, fuckn' up the west coast 
i'm right back up in ya when ya nut 
1-2-3 nut, from the D-R-E but 
this is for the hoes that i used to know 
when i didn't have my '64 and a lot of doe 
i keep ya this and like that 
and i... 
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back 
rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, and i.. 
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back 
rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, and i... 
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back 

Ohh wait, that's that nigga that owe ya that grip

[i ain't got yo money] 
well, yo, check this out, nigga 
what's up *slaps around some guy that owes them money* 
what's up?

[i'll be back though, i'll be back]

Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back 
yeah nigga 
Rat-tat-tat-tat like that, and i.. 
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back 
[chorus] 


Creepin and peepin' and i can get with these 
the chronic, slangin' fat keys from my block 
and it don't stop 
tell me where ya wanna go 
to the strip 
or take a trip bawlin' with the row 
my shit off in ya system 
indo smoke in ya lungs, like that 
and you can lift it, on, and a fist a bomb 
takin' away like hell at Veitnam 
California, back in and on a mission, makin a point 
ain't no fuckin' competition 
they wish they was a runnin' up in reality 
CPT, CAL my locality 
it's strage how i re-arange and change the buisness 
by droppin' shit like this 
dope, ya can't cope with the real 
i peal, in the penatentaries, and when i kill it goes... 
rat-tat-tat-tat like that, and i... never hesitate to put a nigga on his 
back 
[chourus] 

Straight up, now you niggaz know where my homey's comin' from 
so quit the chit-chat, before ya find yourself flat on your biz-out, fool 
it's 9-duce, Dr Drizzay, is sittin on Tizzart! it don't stop 
treartin' buster's like a punk ass kizzart!
