Song:   Lost in the Bossness
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, Circle of bosses, Bear skin rug my magic carpet
Broads dissapear off, Tits thighs so soft
Ain't nah nigga touch, Unless he acceptin the charges
Except for ya mans from New Orleans
Them broads is smart enough to know
That he a pro, And for G he never fallin
So fuck em for a good time, Then fall the fuck off
For he push you off, Because he on his grind
Rollie never set for quality time

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Grown ass women, And little girl games
Thinking that rap is all the same
Think a phat ass gone buy her house....
And it probably will from one of these lames
Sex for checks is the name of they game
But wit the jets you dont go that route
They get lost in the bossness, And all turned around
They get lost in the bossness, If they can't swim the drown
They get lost in the bossness, Watchu bitches gon do now
They get lost in the bossness, Can't go back to fuckin wit them clowns
Because you lost in the....

[Verse 2: Trademark]
Blazin 50's, So back like out the T tops and vibe wit me
Of course wit me, Some broads and a ounce of this new sticky
The whip cloudy, my clothes crispy
Ridien through the city geting high wit my pretty bittie
My game to much for her really, I got her hook on she silly
I'm high, Foucused on millies
She high, Foucused and willin
To do anything I tell her, she does it because im winning
No simpin, Alive and high, Up and living

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Young Roddy]
A good girl gone bad, I seen it all before
Whats worse is that I might be the blame for it though
Shut your mouth that ain't the normal knock at that door
Might be them folks, You betta learn quickly how we roll
Case closed, Add more to my bank roll
She know how this game go, Its cold so we smoke it by the O
You try to keep up not even close
Girl my countin never fold, Fuck you take me for
This one of the trillest shit I ever wrote
Jet Life, Jets Go

[Chorus]</pre>
