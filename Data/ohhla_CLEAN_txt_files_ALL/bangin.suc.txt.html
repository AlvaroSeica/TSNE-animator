Album:  The Take Over
Song:   Bangin' Screw
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus - 2x]
Banging Screw, come down banging Screw
Banging Screw, hands on the wood grain ass on the tight white

[H.A.W.K.]
Hand on the wood grain, ass on the tight white
Candy red 84's, turn on the bub lights
Slowed down thug life, bout to hit the club sights
Crunk night aright, I know what them girls like
Ass on the tight white, hand on the wood grain
Fifth wheel with bang, pop trunk then swang
Nigga slow in the fast lane, deuce out the roof mayn
Blowing on Mary Jane, H.A.W.K. is the truth mayn
Now I'm pushing big Range, doing grown man thangs
Me and Keke changing lanes, still Screwed Up mayn
Representing that S.U.C., for Big Steve and P-A-T
T-R-A-E, and F-L-I-P

[Trae]
Diamonds up against the wood, crawling in the spotlight
White t's creased up, and stomping in my white Nike's
Drama I ain't have it, cause my click too thick
We crawl 84's and dubs, while your shit on bricks
They like to call me a damn fool, when my slab be waving I'm Screwed Up
Misbehave, game sharp like a razor for good
Hate me and I issue slugs, ain't no mo' thinking about it
You doubt it, I'll show you quicker than Percy Miller I'm bout it
I'm thoed with a big body, chain and my cross
When I floss I can get raw, like a nose full of salt
One hunnid is what I be, and you niggaz ain't seeing me
S.U.C. is my family, your's truly T-R-A-E

[Chorus - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
We in now, got money to lend my friends now
And spend now, 22's I'm in the Benz with my kin now
And we ride tight white
Got you mark niggaz scared, like tonight Fright Night
I'm bout to take flight, but I still bang Screw
Original S.U.C., in a sto' near you
When I'm gripping grain, like a Southside lover
Young Don Screw-U, H.A.W.K. and his brother
Right there, when the click was found
Big slab looking good, oh we still come down
When I mash off, it's a hell of a feel
Looking good in that white, steady guiding the wheel yeah

[Lil' Flip]
Hand on the wood grain, ass on the tight white
Ring like a flashlight, custom jersey white Nike's
84's candy do's, DVD remote controls
You know I rep the Screwed Up Click, no matter where I go
On the East on the West, I keep a eagle and a vest
Desert eagle had ears, so tell your people ya dig
I ride around with the heaters, and two seaters and drops
I hustle on the block, until them niggaz call the cops
I'm glad my nigga Screw, put me on a couple tapes
It's four years later, now I'm making major cake
I'm Lil' Flipper for shizzle, so how you love that
I'm living ghetto dreams, just like Fat Pat nigga

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
