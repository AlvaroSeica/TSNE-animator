Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Planet Earth
The place that I live
We live
Who owns it?
You?
Nah... nobody owns this shit
Just a big ass piece of rock with humans on it
Do what the fuck I wanna do

[Verse 1]
A lost human born into a dark society
With what mind state?
There's no variety
Movin' vibrantly
Tryna be the best that I can be
I've tried to see the light and live in life but it just blinded me, irony
Now I'm thinkin' violently
Because I feel my country went and lied to me
It's bringing out a whole new fucking side to me
Ride with me
If you feel my pain then you can cry with me
This fuckin' shady system is the rivalry
They the ones who raised us
Turned us into cage nuts
They're what we're afraid of
They are why we ain't us
They the reason we constantly livin' for money and we just can't budge
It's taking a toll on your dreams, so you gave up
And now the pain stuck
They ain't showin' nothin' but fake love
We just numbers put on a pay stub
Our purpose shouldn't be to make bucks
We all slaves and if we ever make a change then we straight fucked

[Chorus]
I can't stand humans, I hate humans
But I'm a human (I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it
Humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me, you fuckin' human
The problem is killin' my mind
God give me sign, maybe I'm trippin'
Tell me this life is worth livin'

[Verse 2]
Who set the standard for everybody to live by?
How far along in life would you be if you did try?
Who's tryna help these ghetto neighborhoods where kids die?
This world has turned into a mother fuckin' pigsty
I look outside and it disgusts me
It bugs me, it's ugly
I trust no other fucking human but me
So what needs to be done?
Every day is a rerun
Technology is advanced
As people, how far have we come?
Yeah, I can see the time's grown
But still, I'm mind blown
Cause everybody's mind is stuck inside their iPhone
They always textin' and postin' statuses hourly
But in reality, there's no sign of a personality
It's cowardly
We should live life, we scared to get some -ologies
The human being is what we don't know how to be
And honestly
These issues really suck to know
But I refuse to sit and let the trouble grow
So God, show me where the fuck to go!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
How can a man with power feel there's no responsibility?
These rappers blowin' up, but through my eyes they not as real to me
They constantly conceal the beast but never try to heal the streets
Teachin' girls to be a slut, but never make 'em feel unique
How can we feel fine this way?
Open up your minds today
The matrix got you young
Owin' a debt you'll spend your life to pay
Stressed out
Assumin' that you'll be more happier inside your brain
Don't tell me about no fuckin struggle, nigga cause I know pain
To the point where I felt like life was shit
Growin' up as a kid with both parents who got no funds to ever provide you with
Should've just stuck with [?]
The world is tough to be in
Munchin' on fast food
Don't even know what the fuck I'm eatin'
America, I gave it my all
Still you guys arrested me for being black and standing on a sidewalk
It doesn't matter if I'm breaking laws or being harmless
I'm automatically hated by cops cause my dark skin
God was my smartest option
My soul is mine, ya'll ain't gonna bargain off it
Cause if you do that means the darkness profits
The sky is where I got my heart adopted
Man, if we all just took the time to think I swear it won't be hard to stop this
But ya'll assume that I'm just startin' nonsense
But I promise ya'll the fuckin' world is gonna remember Marcus Hopson!
There's consequences for enlightenment
But if I have to hide the truth to live then I'm a die just like my idols did

[Chorus]</pre>
