Verse 1:
Contents under pressure
Tryna keep it together
Through the seasons and weather
They deceive us with pleasure
You ain't livin forever
Hourglass runnin out of time
For the dollar signs
Overtime or crime
Take your pick
Hamster on a wheel
Carrot on a stick
Makes me sick
Man on a mission
Blinded by ambition
Broke, bills pilin' and wishin
For this science fiction
On the screens, on television
Picturin' riches
Lottery tickets
Plenty dead bodies in ditches
On the side of the road to riches
On the wrong end of doing business
Go head and try
Walking a straight line
In a country built on crime
It's like playin' Double Dutch with a crutch
It's never enough
To get you over the hump
But close enough to touch
Plottin' schemes to unattainable dreams
In this rat race
Morphin' into fiends for this cheese
So many homies that died
In what they thought was the fast lane
They shot dead, body-bagged, eulogized, buried before the cash came

(Hook)
Cuz in my mind I can hear 'em saying with they last breath
Singing this song straight to they death
For my time in the sunshine
I gotta live one time
I'm out on these frontlines
I gotta get mine
In this here
Land of the free
Home of the brave
I'm the king of the streets
With a, foot in the grave
Livin' on the edge
One foot off the ledge
Barrel to the head
Watch out for the razors edge

(*On the corner they're turning on each other, and they're self
destructing, but I stayed with them all night long, I wanna hear their case*)

Verse 2:
Plenty kids in the Ps
On the run from the Ds
Turn to Bs and to Cs
Eventually to Gs
In the park sellin' Oz
'Stead of practicin' Js
Even sellin' some E
Go as far as the H
Smoke a dub (W) and get chiefed
Jackin, choppin someVs
Never tryna get A's
Settlin' for a F
Never tryna ask Y
Pull the wool over your eye (I)
It could happen to U
If you don't know who you are (R)
Police knockin' down your door
Soon as they give 'em the cue (Q)
They won't hesitate to shoot
Kill you and blame it on you
You had the 9 double M
You tucked it under your T
Your momma losin' some Z's
On her knees begging please
Cuz once you get your 3rd K
That's 25 with a L
Just as soon as it begins
You very close to the end (N)
Don't see a S on your chest
So a bullet can leave you X'd out
Stretched out
Dead on the corner that's where you left out, next out

(Hook)
Cuz in my mind I can hear 'em saying with they last breath
Singing this song straight to they death
For my time in the sunshine
I gotta live one time
I'm out on these frontlines
I gotta get mine
In this here
Land of the free
Home of the brave
I'm the king of the streets
With a, foot in the grave
Livin' on the edge
One foot off the ledge
Barrel to the head
Watch out for the razors edge

(*Broadcast tonight in the projects, on the corners, even in the gutter,
you must never stop*)

Verse 3:
I wanna riot, rebel
I'm never going to jail
I'm going back into school
You wont play me like a fool
I don't believe what you say
Not in the church or the news
You never walked in my shoes
So I don't live by your rules
Don't want your chain or your watch
I'm not afraid of the cops
I never run from no one
No need to hand me a gun
I'm never going to war
I know what I'm fightin' for
I won't come into your store
Don't call my sister a whore
I wanna work for my bread
Don't want handouts from your Fed
No need to shoot it or snuff
I'm never sellin' this stuff
I got the key to the lock
I keep my eyes on the clock
And my watch is non-stop
With a 1000 men on the block
This is a survival code
I had to follow this road
Start growing into my own
Undo this brainwashin mode
So many died in the grave
Believin lies that you say
I had to break the chains
Just to make it to the next day
There's always time to change
If you want the things that you crave
Or you can die like a slave
In the home of the, home of the brave

(Hook)
Cuz in my mind I can hear 'em saying with they last breath
Singing this song straight to they death
For my time in the sunshine
I gotta live one time
I'm out on these frontlines
I gotta get mine
In this here
Land of the free
Home of the brave
I'm the king of the streets
With a, foot in the grave
One for better days
