[Intro/Chorus]
Get low, get down for the drum drum {*3X*}
For the drum drum, for the drum

[Verse One]
Yeah - white walls, straight halls
Back do' of the city it calls
Black flo' underneath my fall
Black flo' gonna keep us all
Lifeless critic in a black grenade
Like this his fist try to break
Time up, don't speak
All the crew line up for the.. drum beat

[Interlude]
For the, for the {*3X*}
For the drum beat, for the drum

[Verse Two]
White suit, white crew
White light gonna guide me through
Back do' of the city that's proof
Back do' of the city that's truth (woo!!)

[Chorus]

For the drum {*6X in the background fading*}

[Verse Three]
Uh, photobomb this drum you Wookie! Ha ha
Beat calls, my name
One stop gettin off this train
One hop gonna shake this brain
One drop gonna make this day
Routine winner gonna cap the grave
Like this my fist gonna break
Time up, don't speak
All the crew line up for the.. the drum beat (WOOOO~!)
Ha ha, yeah
For the drizzle drizzle drum, drizzle drizzle drum
Aaaah, drum

[Verse Four]
Half time, unwind
Count back as I step in line
Back do' of the city rewind
Back do' of the city it's time

[Outro]
Get low, get down for the drum drum (uhh)
Get low, get down for the drum drum (it's time y'all)
Get low, get down for the drum drum (let go)
For the drum drum - for the drum (woo)
Get low, get down for the drum drum (yeah that's what I'm talkin about)
Get low, get down for the drum drum (that beat call my name)
Get low, get down for the drum drum (it'll call your name too)
For the drum drum - for the drum</pre>
