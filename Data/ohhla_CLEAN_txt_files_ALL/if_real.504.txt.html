Typed by: xorcist1@mediaone.net

Soldiers
Be all you can be
This No Limit shit tho...
We in this for life
This not just a job baby
This an adventure, ya heard me?

Chorus:
Now if you real, keep it real
But if you fake, then you phony
Nigga
Go join the navy,
You can't fuck with this army

[Master P]
I gave a couple niggaz some tanks and I want 'em back
Nigga sent me some beats...But I don't want that
In '89 I had a Benz, you ain't had a buck
I bought your only fuckin house, and your first fuckin truck
You pawn your rolley boy?
Oh...you doin' bad?
Stop trickin' to them hoes, and you wouldn't be on your ass
Now when times got hard
You ran your mouth like a bitch
Sold your soul to the devil, when you ran with other cliques
You ain't no soldier boy
Take that tat off your stomach
Nigga talkin' bout he love me
But bitch you love my money
Now if greed come between me and my niggaz
May god bless his soul
And I hope he forgive me

Chorus

[Silkk The Shocker]
These fake niggaz gon' fall off
We gonna be around for a minute
Thats why niggaz, shoot shots and run
We stick around and finish
Now...see me dogg?
I'm around to win it
And I don't fuck around with you niggaz
Stop step the fuck away from around my Bentley
I'm bought to blow off these fake niggaz head
Sayin' "whats wrong with Slim?"
Them niggaz fake P
That's why theres no fuckin' songs with them
We put our money together
Just like we started with crack
We let a couple niggaz shine
We bought to take it back
You know its mic's now nigga
We started with gats
Let a nigga play me on the streets
So dogg, I ain't gonna start with this rap
Gonna let them fake niggaz go
Thats how we gonna settle down
If we hustle we stil be rich bitch...if we never rap

Chorus

P talking till the end of the song</pre>
