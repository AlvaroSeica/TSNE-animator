BITCH~!
Calling and rippin through my precisions I'm killin
Lyrical villain, I'm higher, touchin the ceilin, I'm willin
to fuckin win this, I'm in this to finish niggaz for dinner
I fuckin send a beginniner, look out below to your temple (boom!)
I call back September, October, November, December
You faggots put on your jackets before it snow in the winter
Rookies and ginger cookies, going to school playin hookie
If I was starting to overlook me
No contest, I arm wres, monster on his Loch Ness
Got more than one penis, hoochies hop up on my crotches
Spotless, fucking a conscious Goddess
In the darkness, latches and harness is all set, I got this
Heartless, congress, condoms, working on a topless
Starvin Marvin', bags accomplished
The compass is directing, sectinh
I get carried away with the sexting, complexing
She's yours, I'm annexing

[Chorus]
I got a gun (I cock it back)
I got a gun (better wear your strap)
I got a gun (nigga, don't get clapped)
You better run (See it in my lap)
I got a gun (nigga, got my gun)
I got a gun (nigga, this shit fun)
I got a gun (I'ma kill that bitch)
You better run

[Hodgy Beats]
Left Brain is my Lex Luger, bitch I'm Waka Flocka
Over the stove, mixin music in a pot of rasta pasta
Swag me the fuck out
I stash my dirty money at Cassie's house
Put my gold teeth in a vulture's mouth
120 degrees a pistol holster's pouch
A radness of warriors, jewlery store, glory whores
Bloody and lovely, Wolf Gang, Coyote Ugly
I'm a wild animal, bitch, I can't be tamed
or identified, or better even named
And hoe, that's a shame
Shoulda applied more effort in this game
Yeah, call me Acronym Jim
Keep my Beretta and my burgundy Timb'

[Chorus]

[Outro: Left Brain]
Shoot that nigga, make sure he dead
Shoot that nigga, aim fo' his head
Kill that bitch, and steal her purse
Call everybody here her phone if that motherfucker works
Take that, bitch
