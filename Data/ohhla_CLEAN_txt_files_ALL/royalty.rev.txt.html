[Intro: The Reverend William Burk]
Ah ah ah, yeah, check it out now
Make way, ah, ay yo

[The Reverend William Burk]
It's my time to shine, I'm sick of waitin' in line
Behind these swine rappers, make way for the Divine
Almighty heavenly being, 'cause words'll make you fleein'
For your life, seein' the light, agreein' with right
I'm like a thief in the night, I'm itchin' to fight
Shinin' so bright and blazin' the mic, the venomous type
The best, and styles resurrected Jesus from his restin'
I kiss Mary on the cheek, she gave me blessings
And told me "Keep rappin' and keep steppin' to lost souls
And teach 'em to live righteous for they reach the crossroads"
I'm spittin' lyrical crossbows during shows
While the masses of people are falling for the fool's gold
The whole rap game is changed, there's too many names
And too many different people lookin' for fame
But I'm here to sacrifice all y'all to God
You thinkin' you can win against Burk, what are the odds?
Choose a side now or your fate's gonna be hard
I'mma make you reach for the stars and leave you scarred

[Chorus: The Reverend William Burk]
Sit back, livin' like kings, God, with royalty
I'm here to bring the fire, try holdin' me
Y'all can't stay afloat, we got natural buoyancy
I took your mic and your girl, they both spoil me
Sit back, livin' like kings, God, with royalty
Y'all sink like ships, try holdin' me
Y'all can't stay afloat, we got natural buoyancy
Your mic and your girl love me, they got loyalty

[The Reverend William Burk]
Surround sound attacks from every angle holdin' me down
During the combat, I'm warrior style
Glorious now, victorious now, luxurious crowns, I'm takin' your grounds
I'm makin' you frown, I'm bound by the sword
Vicious like a bunch of gorillas, I'm standin' over the balcony
At my villa planning to get iller
I hear the whispers of my ancestors tellin' me the secret locations
I can go guaranteed to get mad treasure
And how to live better, how to be a man
Lyrics live forever and so I understand
Everything I say it goes throughout the universe
So if I bust the wrong verse it could be a curse
I feel cursed some days, during times I hurt
Other times I feel blessed when I plan my work
I love being strong, I love being king
I love holdin' on, I love being Burk
Yo, I gotta go hard, 'cause I'm a warrior
A soldier, a scientist makin' that formula
When I perform in a song, I feel heavenly
When I sharpen my sword, I feel deadly
But I gotta march forward and move steadily
Because I'm young and I got mad years ahead of me
Every verse I drop's additional weaponry
Every time I get in a battle it's just to test me

[Chorus] x2

[Outro: The Reverend William Burk]
Got loyalty, true and livin'
Got loyalty, true and livin'
True and livin', word up, got loyalty
To the God, 'cause we royalty
To the God, 'cause we royalty, baby
To the God, 'cause we royalty</pre>
