[CHORUS]
I see your true color, shinin through
I see your true color, an' that's why I love you
I see your true color, shinin through
I see your true color, an' that's why I love you

[VERSE 1]
Yo, father forgive, we all tryin to survive where we live
I'd rather feed the homeless, take time and talk to the kids
Show 'em life ain't no walk in the breeze
Damn as hard as it is, when I be dreamin I be talkin to B.I.G.
In my hood it ain't no yellow brick road, we hear the shots echo
Sneakers hangin from a telephone pole
In my ghetto aint no rainbow wit pots a gold
but the was love from the family when tymes are cold
I seen and analyzed the world  from my project roof
An' seen the hope in the eyes of a troubled youth
A good kid, I kept this burna in dis motha goose
A motherless child, lost in these streets loose
In the immortal words of Ray: these are rainy days
My man got poped at an early age
His college fund saved, flipped into his early grave
They say the good die young, we're headed for dem early gates

CHORUS

[VERSE 2]
yo, they say this love wasnt meant to be
2 people from 2 different worlds, we wasnt meant to be
it musta been fate you were sent to me
we'll make it through these hard tymes, eventually
let's stand and fight, walk by faith and not by sight
we're all the same color when you turn off the lights
I take the sunshine with the pain
Grandma said, when God's sad, that's when it rains
no fridge, kept the food on the window payne
we all breathe the same air so we all the same
I'm trapped in this ghetto maze tryna make it out
if you dont know me dont judge me, wuthcu talkin bout
I'm fathered by the boulevard of the broken dream
single mothas yall my heroes, yall my queens
to get my moms out the hood, thats my hope and dreams
to raise my son to be a soldier by any means

CHORUS TO FADE</pre>
