Now this is what I'm talking about baby (*inhaling*)

[repeat 2X]
And this is for the weed heads and this is for the weedheads
Get a bag of dope and a quarter o

[Chorus: repeat 2X] (2nd and 4th time at end in background "wanna get high get high")
So who want a bag who want a bag
You want a bag you want a bag you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope in a quarter o

[Bizzy Bone]
Alright homies legalize reefer leaves and nines
some of them say we evil a little sumthin sumthin for my people
and though I know that weed will even out your debt
love everything green roll blunts from boxes of cigars said
gonna get ya fucked up wanna get ya fucked up
when you take one hit then I make you hush up nigga shut the fuck up
no stems no indo and chronic hydro and skunk and I can think of some more ohh
yeah time to smoke said so I know high day come around on friday
toke the bowl breath deep boy yes then we pray
as the reefer help me see more everyday woulda me coulda me be Heaven sent
one hell of a superstar bowl every first friday of the month
and your humbily invited were truly humbly united
enemies and all of ya'll hate on when i get my fade on
I'm so high

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]

and givin the weed to the killas niggas forget why they killin (hell ya)

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
thug that talkin till we love that love that that
dont legalize cuz they know we can
gettin high just to get by
through all the suicides and homicides
and genocides drivebys walkbys gonna multiply
and chalk lines in the towns in the h-double-o-d hood and it would rain
and it aint all were it aint all and it aint all and it aint all good
I started at eleven stealin weed from coppers
and even though you beat us I gotta thank you for the reefer
neva mess with white girls but I roll those white boys
niggas come out the pen and they roll some tight joints tight joints
my shit is swollen you shouldnt be rollin
livin on green leaves that will make your heart bleed
just go and let me split up the weed and be silent and sober
no jokin when the nieghbers door is open you want to come over
we smokin tokin and now we chokin tokin and then we chokin chokin chokin
chokin chokin chokin chokin chokin
I'm so high

[Chorus] - repeat until end</pre>
