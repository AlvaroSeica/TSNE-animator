Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!

We all on and I'm in the zone
Everything's in doubles
Everybody got a clone!
You see two women so I see four
But to back it up and dump it
Make sure you hit the floor!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin
In a chick with a face something like Letoya Lucket
We both hands on
Something like a puppet
And her booty like a pillow
Makin smooth wanna fluff it
Make that back drop like a new song or album
I just wanna play all in yo middle like Malcolm
My name ain't Vick but I'm something like a falcon
I'm fly as I wanna be with all the women under me

[Chorus]
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!

I'm in the back with that Carnavaux
With the light on my neck like a Carnavaux
Is too many girls and I want them all
The way they bounce that thing like a basketball!
Call on my Willy, they talkin bout Wanka
She backed it up and dump it like a truck Tonka
Send your bullies home
Just to fly on my red bull drink when the boy passed by
She's looking like a keeper
So I think I need her
She said her name was Nina
She reminded me of my heater
So I grabbed her by the waist, pull her back
And made her dump it!
Criminal bootie, oh my God, I could cuff it

[Chorus]
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!

Hey, shawty is like a stripper
Look at them legs, she can't get no thicker
And if she did, she a be fat
Back it up and dump it for me, baby just like that!
Hey ya! Baby let your weave down
If you ain't with the boys in the V.I.P leave now
Cause Bone get Scummy and I like rhymin
So grab that pole, and slide like diamond
And her thong there it ain't no finding
All of that booty, big booty judy
I think me and you girl should go and make a movie
I'm not playing games, just calling you for a duty

[Chorus]
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
Hit it</pre>
