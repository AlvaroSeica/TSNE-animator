Congratulations, we made it, Welcome to The Crusader
It's been a long time commin' y'all

How many dudes you really know? can flow, like this
Like this, like this, lets do it..

[Chorus]
Uh
How many dudes you know roll like this?
How many dudes you know flow like this?
Not many, if any, not many, if any
How many dudes you know who got the skills to go in and roarck a show like this?
Uh uh, uh uh, I don't know any body

How many dudes you know roll like this?
How many dudes you know flow like this?
Not many, if any, not many, if any
How many dudes you know who got the skills to go in and roarck a show like this?
Uh uh, uh uh

[Verse 1]
Check, check to tha mic check
A 1, 2 from a crew commin' through, are ya hyped yet?
Nowa days every body wanna talk, like they got something on scribe
Ya ain't got nothing but a moment alive
You can't front, when ya feellin' tha vibe
You know scribe is takin' you high (high)
Love it with the double bass, vibrate
Shook tha place, in ya vertebrate
Yo hit a man, move like a RS
Subaru, with a crew, come a equipped, like a body kit
Lyrically I burn quick
So one foot is in tha style, thought his tongue like a steel fish
This kid named X, from Vic, wanna get with scribe
In live, like a 0-5, I got vibe, like a beehive
And when the mother from the squid of a pimp, of tha sea side
And get yo on the way that we ride
Round town in tha down low, never know, what the flow, bro, chop chop
cant stop Hip Hop, cause it don't stop
Hmm check it out (Yes)
check it out (No)
check it out (What)
check it out (Like me)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Somthin' for tha ride on cruse control
When tha bass vibrates, shook tha hives like a earthquake
Thought this is not good for yah, you made a great mistake
Your eyes stop and bomp be gone, sick of this, flick the switch
Nitrous, kick wanna trip this is some new shit
Real deal, like Cody field, you know telling if you rock like mike or just might
Roarck Like doubie, drop, doubie drop tight
T-Club get it on, represent all night
Take flight, like Nike kicks with tricks and make quick
When the vibe hit
Don't sit just get on down and profound with the sound that we found
with the underground
Don't sit just get on down and profound with the sound that we found
with the underground

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Next time you come on down to North Canterbury
It's all good, it's all good when come down to my hood and come to
South Canterbury
it's all good uh uh, it's all good when you come down to my hood and
come to East Canterbury
it's all good yeah, it's all good when you come down to my hood and go
to West Canterbury
it's all good yeah, it's all good up in my neck of da woods-ahh</pre>
