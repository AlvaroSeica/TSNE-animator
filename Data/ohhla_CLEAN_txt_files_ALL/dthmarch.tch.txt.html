[DJ Green Lantern]
This is an invasion, an occupation
Immortal Technique, the evil genius DJ Green Lantern
And you're now in the state of guerilla warfare
It has been spread by the superpowers of the industry
To the 3rd World underground of the streets
This is for all those who've been labeled extemists, maniacs, terrorists
Shit.. Welcome to the 3rd World

[Immortal Technique]
Yeah.. Yeah..

Invansion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
Peruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians

Invansion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
[2x]

Invansion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
Peruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians
They call us terrorists after they ruined our countries
Funding right-wing paramilitary monkeys
Tortured our populace then blamed the communists
Your lies are too obvious, propoganda monotanous
And that's not socialist mythology
This is urban warfare through the streets of your psychology
So I'm like the legs of a paraplegic really
Cause I'm still part of you even if you can't feel me
You can never debate me, The M4s at your baby
Like troops with gats in Iraq do daily
So you can marginalize the way you portray me
But don't get Hollywood and try to play me
We can shoot it out in the theater like troops in the 80s
New Jack City classic crap era, mack-milli
Shouting BET is not black-owned on Rap City
You got a contract to kill me motherfucker, that's fine
Cause there's a contract to kill your family when I die
So when your car explodes, don't be surprised
Soldier, I'm like Marine Corp C4
Even blow the spot with the beat rocking at 3/4
Canvas the flow like the ghost of Michaelangelo
This is the anthem, Immortal Technique and Green Lantern
Don't say shit bitch, you don't want the "check, check"
To become a ::chick, chick:: You know what I'm sick with
Lyrical tuberculosis, cocaine overdoses
Blood coming out your noses, that's when death approaches
March to my death smilin, laugh if the end's violent
There's no escape from this political asylum

Revolutionaries don't fear execution
Cause the death of my visible Constitution
Is just the beginning of spiritual evolution
God will reincarnate me as revolution

[DJ Green Lantern]
You can't take out a revolution
You can't kill a idea
Fuck is you stupid?
You kill that man, be becomes Immortal

[Immortal Technique]
Ignore the triplets, this is a fully loaded four-four
3rd World underground hardcore
Street-hop, locked and loaded, motherfucker you should know it
Blast the door to the game open and overthrow it</pre>
