I need Christ, that's the only thing I know
I really can't breathe right, I'm strangled by animosity from my own people
Daily it's hard to be nice, my face is frowned up everywhere I go
And I can't sleep nights, I'm in my ride trying to find my foes
They say my music won't make it, cause I don't rap cars and dancing
I rap pain, poverity and fraud romancing
Who gon' represent for that brother on death row
And let him know whether he did or not, God had his back from the get go
Or lil' mama that's hustling, risking her freedom
House full of kids not one of the baby daddy's around, and she just trying to feed em
Even if she's laying on her back for bread
Instead of talking about her, show her how to earn it without opening legs
Why my people rather point fingers, and turn up their noses
Showing love is striking a match, yeah the anger's so explosive
And I'm guilty, just like everybody else
When I'm talking to ya'll, I'm talking to self
I know you tired of showing love, and never getting it shown back to ya
When all you need is a hug, your people show their backs to ya
Believe me when I tell you, everytime the world and the devil diss you
If God is your homie, can't nobody in the world fuck with you
 
[Hook]
If you feel like you wanna die sometimes, you can relieve stress to this
Just keep God first in your life, even when it feel like he ain't blessing it
If you get mad like I get mad, then you be agg'd like everyday
But all you gotta do is learn to let go, and let God handle it and then you can say
I don't give a damn, but all these fellas dropping salt on you mayn
I don't give a damn, but you can't pay your bills cause you short on your change
I don't give a damn, man I just saw your woman hugging and kissing another man
I don't give a damn cause God got me, and if you don't know you better ask somebody
 
[Z-Ro]
800 days minimum wage, bout to lose your house if you don't get a raise
Just stay close to going to work, with a twelve gauge
Yeah you see a new millennium, but feel like you in the stone age
Stressing every seven minutes, from living with AIDS
Subtracting days from your life, but not because of the virus
You dying from worrying about thangs, you can't change
Be mad at satan, it's too many other names to blame
Only God can bring fourth rain, or smother pain flames
And then the sun gon' shine
No matter what the doctor tell ya, the Lord decides when it's the end of your time
Just look at Magic, yeah it was tragic but he's still at it
Looking functioning, and feeling fantastic
I know my people cry a river, and it's alright to cry
Don't commit suicide, you can't make it to heaven taking your own life
So repeat after me, the devil ain't pimping me
Cause I can do all things, through Jesus Christ who strengthens me
 
[Hook]
 
[Z-Ro]
Look lil' mama, I can feel what you going through
You're another Diamond dancing at the player's club, trying to pay your way through school
And to the brother, that's out jacking brothers who doing better
Homie, you ain't gotta do it like that
I know it's difficult trying to make it, if you ain't having cheddar
But what you gon' do, when brothers strike back
And just because you're white, and I'm not
Doesn't mean, I'm trying to plot on taking your last dime
But I know, just because I got a diamond grill in my mouth
You thinking I wanna steal, dollar bills out your house
Even though you think I'm an animal, I don't give a damn
A true hero under God, that's what I am
