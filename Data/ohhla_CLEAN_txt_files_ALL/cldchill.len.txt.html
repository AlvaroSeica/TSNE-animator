Ayo what's up, my name is D-Rock the number one
I'm here to celebrate the first annual 
Four Ways to Rock blowing up the spot party
We got the MCs, DJs and breakers up in here tonight
So let's get down to it
Remember to keep it peaceful and dance
Come on

[Sharon Costanzo] {Kurtis Blow}
We're partying Friday night
And getting all good to go
We're partying Friday night
Cold chillin' in stereo
We're partying Friday night
And getting all good to go {to the beat y'all, and you don't stop}
We're partying Friday night {huh huh uh}
Cold chillin' in stereo

[Kurtis Blow] {D-Rock} (Both)
Yo yo yo yo
People gather round
What we have here is a brand new sound
So come on everybody let's all get down
To the red yellow black to the white or brown
Come on everybody let's have some fun
(We're going to make two MCs sound like one)
It's like that y'all {that y'all}
Like that y'all {that y'all}
(It's like tha-tha-tha-that, it's like that y'all)
What

[Sharon Constanzo] {Kurtis Blow}
We're partying Friday night {huh huh huh}
And getting all good to go {to the beat y'all, you don't stop}
We're partying Friday night {huh huh huh}
Cold chillin' in stereo {what what what what what}

[D-Rock]
Yo everbody, could y'all move back and form a circle
The dancers are about to hit the floor
Also all those competing in next week's break battle, 
please sign up at the back
Y'all having a good time?
I said y'all having a good time?

[Kurtis Blow] (Both)
We got the b-boy breakers up in the club
MCs on the mic so give up some love
And DJs breaking beats from the old school hits
Graf writers bomb while the booming bass kicks
(So throw you hands up it's Friday night)
(Cold chillin' in the spot and the vibe is right)
To the beat y'all, beat y'all
And you don't stop, stop
It's Len and Kurtis Blow
(And we're blowing up the spot)

We're partying Friday night {huh huh huh huh}
And getting all good to go {to the beat y'all and you don't stop}
We're partying Friday night {huh huh huh}
Cold chillin' in stereo
We're partying Friday night
   "It's Friday night"
And getting all good to go
   "Ain't a damn thing funny"
We're partying Friday night
   "Friday night"
Cold chillin' in stereo
   "Ain't a damn thing funny"
We're partying Friday night
   "Chill" "Chill"
