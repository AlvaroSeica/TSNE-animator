[Intro: Xzibit]
(OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHH!!)
C'mon (OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHH!!)
SING WITH ME! YEAH!!
Yeah, but you don't want none
We got yo' bitch, I'm ridin shotgun
Yeah, spread it out, spread it out, spread it out
(OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHH!!)
Go, let it out, yeah, ha, c'mon, yeah, yeah, yeah, YEAH!!
(OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHH!!)

[Xzibit]
Yo, I'm heavy-hearted, heavy-handed
Misunderstandings turn to permanent repercussions, I empty the cannon
I'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in a wood
Drink a gallon of Henny, throw it up for the hood
I'ma ride for my people, give my people a voice
Never follow the leader, use the weapon of choice
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage
Conversations with God, spillin my soul out
I own assault weapons that fold out like Megatron
The iron lung, drop atom bombs on Babylon
So tag along like a dog with a vagabond
Smoke 'til the sack is gone
Niggaz on they grind put my motherfuckin records on, so they can relate
through the hate and the pain, through the struggle and strain
Never take it in vain, breathin one and the same
Pressure push your forehead out the back of your brain
So now

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Yo spread me out nigga
Yeah, yeah
Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out
It go (OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHH!!)
Yeah, and you can't get none
(OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHH!!)
You don't want none, you can't get none
Spread the fuck out, or catch these hot ones

[Xzibit]
Yeah, I try not to get involved with the nonsense
I'm from the time where you couldn't post comments
Couldn't hide behind a computer
Catch a fade or get shot by the shooter, a barracuda for Buddha
I maneuver through the manure, ignorin the allure of the illusion
My bad, sorry for all the confusion
If you thought I was finished, if you thought I was done
Let the saga continue, bring it back on the one
I'm comin back with a gun, cause that's all that I know
Meditated intentions, my shit ready to go
Never takin it slow, in my profession you need aggression
A weapon you can brandish at your own discretion
And a hero's just a sandwich, nigga what's your preference?
I chose balance, now I'm headed in the right direction
Executive decisions, now my family is good
Make it well understood, put it back where it should - be

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Yo spread me out nigga
Yeah, yeah
Spread it out, spread it out, spread it out
It go (OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHH!!)
And you can't get none
(OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHH!!)
You don't want none, you can't get none
Spread the fuck out, or catch these hot ones

[Xzibit]
Yeah, yeah
This go for all my people, people who see we equal
I feel it comin, it's dark, God protect us from evil
We've been sold an illusion, cockamamie confusion
People constantly losin, we suffer EVERYWHERE!
Enough with all this swagger, parties and body baggin
We in recession, we starvin, let me show you what's happenin
Money's so fuckin tight, the root to all them fights
She make you wanna not ever never come home at night
But see now there you go, off with that strippin hoe
While your woman is wonderin where does all your money go
You tryin to make it rain, maybe rock you a chain
Maybe get you some brain, from bitches EVERYWHERE!
Pussy nigga you lame, get on top of yo' game
Feed yo' family mayne, this is simple and plain
Children retain, remember live in live out the pain
That's when they curse your name then proceed to do the same

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Yeah, so spread me out nigga...
Spread it out yeah, spread it out yeah, spread it out
It go (OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHH!!)
And you can't get none - yeah
(OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHHHHHH-OHHHH!!)
You don't want none, you can't get none
Spread the fuck out, or catch these hot ones
