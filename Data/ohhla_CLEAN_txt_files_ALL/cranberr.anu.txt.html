My last name is Five, that's three plus two
Constantly elevating like a hot air balloon
Shifting through these clouds on the wing of a hawk
Eroded by the sea like the edges of a rock
I get down before I get up
And locate around the middle so the elements keep inside my touch
Planting seeds and such and sleep under the money tree
And casually walk away cause dollar bills don't mean shit to me
Walking on my hands in this upside down world 
Guard my trust like the oyster defends it's very pearls
The feather ink starts to twirl and spiral around the page
That gradually turns yellow over the years and the letters fade away
I slipped inside an envelope and sealed it with snail gloss
And sent myself on a journey at the flat rate my name costs
I got shifted to the edge of the planet
Tumbled down the waterfall but I didn't think to panic
I crash landed somewhere near the crossroads of fate
And talked language with the ambient voice of my soulmate
So heavenly her gaze caught my glare
It's funny how a whisp of smoke looks like a lock of angel's hair
This butterfly catastrophe has caught me off my guard
Looking through the lenspiece when I'm already amongst the stars
Always searching for a way to make my parents proud
Gentle rain dripping on me from these cumulous clouds
Changing up the patterns through the concept of string theory
I turn a deaf ear when the population hears me
Can't help aging like a photograph 
Torpedoing down this tunnel of time reaching out for the past
I crack a cranberry gingerale and watch my days unfold
Sit back with a tourist's map and watch myself grow old
I crack a cranberry gingerale and watch my days unfold
Stand in front of a mirror and watch myself grow old


My birth name is Stephen with a ph
Clean slate from my past filled with pure hate
An issue that I thought I had resolved
But answers are made twice as numb through the magic 8-ball
I bled on my conscience more than once in one day
Dropped tears at the pity of plastic flowers on your grave
The days went by quick caught up in our fix
The basic qualities of reality mixed with friendship
Hush now growing child living till you're seventeen
Drank the emotion potion hoping to avoid this guillotine
I stood frozen, binded by winter and terror
In some mistaken error I was your pallbearer
This glitch had me uncompatible with simple tasks
Overloaded with councilling and anxiety attacks
I had an overload of depression
Tried to delete it but it came back with program protection
I stared into the sun until my cornia's peeled off
Seen people at face value on the serpents see-saw
Teetering all over the edge
I hopped on the balance beam and struggled to keep a clear head
Sliding down these slippery streams
I found myself drowning in a puddle of my own self-esteem
Fading like the grey pages of old Exit Theme
I pop designer drugs to escape reality
Wrinkling time and riding on the pegasus
Gracefully absorbing the wind bumping on my genesis
That's about the time when I hopped off a connecting flight
And made a phonecall to the lady that would one day save my life
I fell in love for the first time
Rejuvenated and rebirthed from my Allison's star shine
Can't help aging like a photograph
Torpedoing down this tunnel of time reaching out for the past
I crack a cranberry gingerale and watch my days unfold 
Sit back with a tourist's map and watch myself grow old
I crack a cranberry gingerale and watch my days unfold
Stand in front of a mirror and watch myself grow old</pre>
