(Into my brain)

Something sinister sits in the corner
Ignore it if you want, but remember that we warned you
There in the basement, behind the furnace
Eating off all of your fears so I can flourish
Puts the shook in your bones
Making all my noise when your parents aint home
And if the bulbs burnt out in my underground lair
Guarantee you're gonna sprint back up them stairs
Step by step by, let me get by
It's all in your mind, you do it every time
The dark you're scared, is anybody there?
Try to stay strong, pray for help
Well you can bring that fear, I survive on it
I thrive on it, I'm alive as you allow
When I climb out of your mind, to eat your time
You can redeem your fear now
And all the white girls sing along

Into my brain (repeated)

You can hear me growl, you can smell it fowl
But as hard as you try you'll never see me prowl
You can feel my touch to the heart and spine
Some have all the luck all the time
Fear that I might take your life
Fear that I might fuck your wife
When you hear a gun, you hear my voice
When you hear a crash, you hear my voice
That tingle on the back of your skull
Cut the edge off insanity, the blade is dull
They gave their all, but I took a little more
Cause I made a promise that I would win this war
Cause I made a promise, I'm fear motherfucker
Cause I made a promise, I'm here motherfucker
The bams, the booms, the bumps in the night
When it's on, it's on
And all the white girls sing along

Into my brain (repeated)

Get over it, get over me
You're the one that left me my opening
Forgot to put the lid down tight to the truth
So I climbed out and set myself loose
The only thing to fear, is fear itself (I'll kill you)
Love, money, God and health (I'll spill you)
Where do you put your trust (I'll kill you my damn self)
Is it within or is it with us?
Is it breath or is death?
What in the name of God do you run from
Run for, run to someone, done for
Sit still and take it like the bitch you are
You can fight and resist, you won't get too far
You made me, all the power you gave me
Cultivate the hatred and fed it to the babies
Spent lifetimes pretending I'm a kook, but I'm a product of you
Now all the women sing along
