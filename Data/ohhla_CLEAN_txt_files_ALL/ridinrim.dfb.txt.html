Yeah nigga
Young Juvie (Young Juvie)
All y'all niggas
Y'all know what this is (y'all know what this is)
We don't ride these no more nigga
We inhere wit flats nigga
We sittin' on lebron back over here
All y'all fake mounted aa niggas ridin' these
We stop ridin' these in '99 (chicka chicka)
Put that lil' boy shit up
(So So Def)

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 1]
I got more grams than teddy got a cam in my Chevy
my car go (eeerrrrr) and when I ride I'm ready
Look like I'm glidin' on nothin', when I ride I be skatin'
I pull up swervin on niggas they don't be tryin' they be hatin'
they only ridin' on 20's
They might as well ride on hubs
if it ain't deuces or better
You might as well put 'em up cause where I'm from (from)
We mount up and ride on dem big rims
a whole supply of deuces that spin harder than windmills
I been real (yeah) always too clean
cause I pack heat or white leather guts plush bitch scream
in the back seat 23's on my fuckin' street so I ride and I swerve
But we too clean for the fuckin' street so I ride wit a perve

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 2]
I got the Chevy sittin' high by matchin' corna' ties
Michael Jordans mounted up that's 23's on the ride(jizzal man)
I got man in the trunk I'm workin' the Alpine
Paint flippin', candy drippin', plus the wood inside
drivin' a big boy drop, a T.V. in the rear
The european clip on the rotatin' rim
Just got 'em up out jail (and the motherfuckin' smokin')
Bust a couple U-turns (With the do's wide open)
Punchin' on the gas pedal make pipe start chokin'
Comin' down real clean, got 66 LeBron back home
Look I'm sittin' right on it driving up through the lanes
On the corner straight gunnin'

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 3]
Loud pipes satin music with the judo eyes
2nd tone background with two inch ties
Cut the curb on the block it's a concert line
(D.F.B. send me bitch) swervin' side to side
Yup the Cutlass mounted up like a H3 Hummer
But it's stuntin' one on one cause I'm the number one stunna
going down 20 (yu) doing more than a honda
Since my paint wet they say my trunk sound like thunda'
Break the law (run the red light) driving illegal
In a nice ol' school flow like dead people
I park where I can't hit button make my do's pop
Rims go round and round custom seats lean 'n rock

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 4]
Now my rims spin nigga (err) every time I make a stop
And I keep the chevy clean Like a flow on disk it mop
When I'm posted at the light got a button that make the top drop
Now hoes hoppin' on my dick like they playin' hopscotch
Hhhoes hoppin' on my dick like they playin' hopscotch
When I'm on the E-way you see me hit it then I'm gone
Shinin' red paint and I touch that whistle
Siliconin I stay deep (stay deep) hopin' at all cause I don't mind
Cause I'm wood grippin' flip switchin' flippin Alpine
It's pimpin' nigga So I'm a always stunt
nigga pull up on the chevy and get burnt like my blunts
nigga I keep good product in the hood it get delivered (delivered)
Sittin' back watchin' movies in the rearview mirror

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
