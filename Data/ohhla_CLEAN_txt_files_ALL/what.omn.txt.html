ayo I came through the door
dropping lingo on boriquas
stepping in an all white suit with black sneakers
exotic dime pieces
faces like cheetas
bouncing big titties and booya wife-beaters
my roll my ease up
poster roll weed up
vip seater
coast to coast speaker
every time you see us
you know we known to keep a
liter of tequila
fresh out the freezer
pop the top
??? party bag
take a cup cup
keep it up
before you know it it be creeping up
what what
got the shit
you can't get enough of
bartender let me get a shot of that ???
???
hold up where did all this ass come from
bubble butt jeans with the top button undone
showing off your tongue like you got it going on
till the dj play your favorite song
shake it to the drum

what...

back on the scene
so fresh, so clean
I'mma do my thing till that fat bitch sing
check out my lean like it's nothing but a thing
pick your lip up off the floor
quit looking at me mean
I see you in a while
yo you cramp my style
fuckin' with my high
make me lose my cool
I already done did what your crew tried to do
and I got something to make me the same size as you
needles to the grooves make a nigga act a fool
put it in the air like there's nothing else to do
go and get a room
get yourself some elbow room
'cause I came here to fuck up your brand new shoes
fucking with the best
I be present in the flesh
super emcee with a 's' on my chest
expect nothing less
I always keep my shit fresh
then I make it sound easy
completely no stress
