"I've been havin MeatShake for forty years"

"I love MeatShake!"

"Meat and shake, that's all I need, m-hm"

"I have MeatShake every day at school"

"Look, when I'm hungry I need some meat
I don't need none of that rabbit food they're servin over at Veggie Hut"

"Meat to the Shizzake"

"Bro, I down lots of MeatShakes, man"

"I'd love to taste the secret"

"Lunch break, only got a half an hour
Gotta get something in my system, I go to MeatShake"

"Eat at MeatShake!"

"Taste the secret at MeatShaaaaake, hey"

"MeatShakes are so soft, I can eat em without my dentures"

Well hi, welcome to MeatShake where you can 'taste the secret'
And when I tell you what it is, you won't believe it
There's something special in our food you'll taste when you start eating it
Everything we serve has meat in it

But don't you serve french fries and a vegetable plate?
It all has meat (What?)
What about the green salad and the cookies you bake?
Everything has meat (Oh...)
It's nice and tender
Mixed in a blender
Don't you want some meat? (Yeah)
So hot and steamy
Yet smooth and creamy
Come and get your meat (Hey)

Now when your body's hungerin, drive on down and stumble in
Come on, give us half a chance, I promise that you'll come again
If you're not carniverous consider us a challenge
You're too lean and need some proteine, we got it by the gallons
Rest assured our healthy indiscriminating guests prefer
The sweet and meaty morsels we concoct behind my register
Giving good service plus a smile in a paper hat
Our competition's food is crap, who would wanna pay for that?
Please try a beef pie, top it with some meat fries
And a classic MeatShake, baked until the grease dried
40 cents more, you can have your meal meat-sized
Plus you get three tries, scratch and win a free prize
All except you vegan men who need to be leavin and
Head into the Veggie Hut where you can eat some leaf and gran
That is unless of course you wanna taste the secret sin
Come on, breathe it in, you can use your teeth again
Remember that meat's your friend, so let it inside you
Cows gotta die too, don't let them survive you
There's an offer for a free shake when you buy two
Lasts while supplies do, thanks, please drive through

Skinny mini or a beefcake
Hey, you don't need steak, get a MeatShake!
You want a meaty meal but your teeth ache
Hey for Pete's sake, get a MeatShake!
You're gonna take your girl on a cheap date
And you're a cheapskate, so get a MeatShake!
When you purchase a combo meal you receive a souvenir keepsake
Get a MeatShake!

Offer for free souvenir keepsake for a limited time only
at participating MeatShake stores in your area

"Mmhh... I better go taste the secret right now"</pre>
