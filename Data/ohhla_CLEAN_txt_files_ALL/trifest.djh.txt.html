Intro:
Uh, ha ha yeah you know what time it is
Do you know what time it is? Uh
(what time is is baby what time?) Yeah.
(Beatnuts) Blaze it.

Psycho Les:
Once again back it's thee incredible 
Imperial your material is edible
So I'm a dead it the good life I'm a get it
Hip hop I'm a wet it criticly politicly 
You can never shit on me
Sun bunny how could it be 
I let you live listening to the good in me
You got to pay more I'm through livin' crazy poor
When I've been doing this here since 84
Crazy raw rushing ghetto marawanero 
Burn more green then flushing marrow sipping Armaretto
Like Camp Lo my voice thunder and make your amp blow
Look in the back and see the black smoke
I be the clever roni
Son you forever phoney
Bow down to the dutch master of the ceremony (ceremony)
Motherfuckers (motherfuckers)

Hook:
(Who's the trifest?) My clique be the trifest
Packin' heavy metal devieces and whatever the price is
Good pay freeze your income (Isis) 
One minute on top now we on top that's the way life is

JuJu:
No such thing as too much class to much cash
This little nigga get's too much ass
I wouldn't say that I'm mad rich 
But I stay grillin' a bad bitch
I guess it all come with the package
The beat flipper big tipper I drink my liquor 
Straight cause I'm feelin' much quicker
I rhyme sicker you fuckin' nervous
Ten years of community service for that wack flow
Actin' like you stack doe
Play the back DJ Honda's on the track yo
Beatnuts forever die hard let the mack go
Da da da da da niggas show me the stash
Now you know that we Out For The Cash

Hook

Talking:
That's the way life is. Uh yeah Beatnuts, no doubt. 9-7 9-8.
