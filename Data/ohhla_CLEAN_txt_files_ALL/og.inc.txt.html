[Black Child + Charli Baltimore]
My nigga Ja sold more records then a  {O.G.}
Ty flyin by in 'Lac truck like a {O.G.}
and Gotti's dough's quiker then a {O.G.}
Ferrari and Charli and Jody move like a {O.G.}
Ol' Wizzy and Ronnie is gettin money like a {O.G.}
V-I-T-A and PJ's a {O.G.}
All day, everyday, Chris Gotti's a {O.G.}
Forever, and allways, Black Child's a {O.G.}
Gangsta's, hustlahs, strippahs, niggas, stand up!
Murder Inc. has now entered the building

[Black Child]
Get ya hands up! its like money's fallin from the ceiling
Understand us! Nigga it's hard to touch a million
I thank God for my children, all the cars all the women
We gangstas! And there aint a day that by
a Hustlah! Don't look back and reflect on his life 
We're a customed to ice, guns grams and dice
and bitches that go both ways like hazard lights

[Charli Baltimore]
We the underdog niggas but we can't be touched 
so y'all motherfuckahs better ante up
cause everything we drop, is platinum plus (yo, whattup!!)
Show me, You're an O.G.
(2x)

(Black Child)
yo man money, he funny, he a dummy, he aint a {O.G.}
He gangsta, but he holy, might be a {O.G.}
High profile but low key like a {O.G.}
Go roll he's OD by a {O.G.}
Marvin Gay, Quincy dog, that's a {O.G.}
Billy Holiday, Cassius Clay that's a {O.G.}
Black Child nigga, I'm respected like a {O.G.}
Check my jail record I'm connected like {O.G.}

If you don't know, now you know, 
snakes high, gras low, let's go!
Nigga I step in the boot with bitches
Ever since the Murder album hear the Inc. in every city
Ever since a nigga been, be in the system
It's sickening how Black Child make white people listen
We different and y'all niggas is all the same
ya think when I ball is a game, get dumped in a hole of flames
I'ma show you what they call pain, in the eyes of O.G.
Go Nas, you as young as OD
