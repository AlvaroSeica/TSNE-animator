[Kendrick Lamar]
Tired of running, uh, tired of hunting
Uh, my own kind, but retiring nothing
Uh, tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Uh, hands on the wheel, uh, who said we wasn't, uh, dying of thirst 
Uh, dying of thirst, uh, dying of thirst

Uh, dope on the corner, uh, look at the coroner
Uh, daughter is dead, uh, mother is mourning her
Uh, strayed bullets, uh, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Uh, bring her back, uh, who got the footage?
Uh, Channel 9, uh, cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Uh, banana clip, split his banana pudding
Uh, I'm like Tre, uh, that's Cuba Gooding
Uh, I know I'm good at, uh, dying of thirst
Uh, dying of thirst, uh, dying of thirst

Uh, how many sins? Uh, I'm running out
Uh, how many sins? Uh, I lost count
Dreams of balling like Spalding but only shotty bounce
Uh, he reaper calling, uh, I'm cottonmouth
Uh, money is power (money is power), yours is ours (yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, uh, die with a coward
Uh, hope we get rich, uh, hope we can tower
Uh, over the city with vanity with the music louder
Uh, the same song, uh, a black flower
Uh, I'll show you how to, uh, dye your thirst
Uh, dye your thirst, uh, dye your thirst

Uh, what are we doing? (What are we doing?) Uh, who are we fooling? (Who are we fooling?)
Uh, Hell is hot (Hell is hot), uh, fire is proven (fire is proven)
Uh, to burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Uh, tired of running, uh, choirs is humming
Uh, tell us to visit, uh, we lying 'bout coming
Uh, now back to business, uh, loading the guns in
Uh, back of the Buick, your hood is feuding and the beef is bubbling
Uh, it's no discussion, uh, hereditary
Uh, all of my cousins, uh, dying of thirst
Uh, dying of thirst, uh, dying of thirst

Uh, too many sins, uh, I'm running out
Uh, somebody send me, a well for the drought
Uh, see all I know, uh, is taking notes
Uh, on taking this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
Uh, my best days, uh, I stress days 
(Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, uh, I stress days
Uh, say "Fuck the world," uh, my sex slave
Uh, money, pussy and greed; what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Uh, tired of running (tired of running), tired of running (tired of running)
Tired of tumbling (tired of tumbling), tired of running (tired of running)
Uh, tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say "See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst, you dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"

[Skit/Outro]
Fuck! Im tired of this shit! Im tired of fuckin' runnin', Im tired of this shit! Thats my brother, homie!
"Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is. 
Why are you so angry? See you young men are dying of thirst.
Do you know what that means? You need water, holy water.
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of The Lord.
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior? Okay, repeat after me.
"Lord God, I come to you a sinner" (Lord God, I come to you a sinner)
"And I humbly repent for my sins" (And I humbly repent for my sins)
"I believe Jesus is Lord" (I believe Jesus is Lord.)
"I believe you raised him from the dead" (I believe you raised him from the dead.)
"I would ask that Jesus come into my life" (I would ask that Jesus come in my life.)
"And to be my Lord and Savior" (And to be my Lord and Savior.)
"I receive Jesus to take control of my life" (I receive Jesus to take control of my life.)
"And that I may live with him from this day forward" (And that I may live with him from this day forward.)
"Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood" (Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood.)
"In Jesus name, amen" (in Jesus name, amen.)
"Alright now, remember this day: the start of a new life
Your REAL life."</pre>
