[Mr. Shadow]
I follow you
All of you
Every single one of you
Shadow be the man with the plan
That'll shadder you
Flatter you, with my style
Let me show you how
We do it down south
Yeah, we do it down south
Buildin clout is what it's all about
You know the route
Triple 6 burn the cruisifix
Bringin heat to snitches
In ditches I throw em
These bitches I show em
I'm sicker then a virus
When I slide this bomb
And blow em, apart
The cause be showin futures and paths
And how many of my rivals
I'ma put inside the past
Outlast any mothafucka in a confrontation
You wanna meet your maker
Then you're killer's who you're facin
Like Jason
I sock them sons of bitches through the night
Gotta do the krime right
So I'm turnin off the light
Surprise I'm no where to be found
Not a sound heard
All you feel is the blitz
Like you're swiggin off the Thunderbird
Vision's gettin blurry
And now you're in a hurry
To make a get away
But your ass is gonna stay
Cause I say so
I let's go, my trigger has not heart
And I'm standin in the dark
Bout to blow your ass apart
Fool

[Chorus]
Who am I
The stalker of your life
You wanna fuck around
Then you have to pay the price
6 feet deep in a mothafuckin hole
I'm takin on your soul
Now you got now where to go
[2x]

[Mr. Shadow]
I can feel the anger rushin in vein
And in my brain I'm hearin voices
Got no choices
I call my boys to bring the pain
Mary Jane got me trippin
Got me thinkin nothin but the worst
How I want these mothafuckas
Wrapped in plastic ridin in a hearse
But first you re-inverst me
What you owe you oughtta know
That nothin's free
You're payin me to seperate you from your soul
The Lord told me that I'm unforgiven to the death
So the sins that I be doin
Will guarentee your last breath
In the middle of the night
When you hear the dogs bark
You know I'm in your park
You can feel it in your heart
Start to pray say your hail mary's
Try to call the father
But that won't do a damn thing
I put that on my daughter
See I rode with them fools
That be kcikin up dust
Blad headed individuals
Turnin fools into a was
The cause of death is never revealed
Only you and I know what I do and what you feel
But still I never leave a trace
Evidence erased
Place the weapon in your hand
And makin suicide your case
But wait you see the star that's on my chest
5 pointed don't disapoint me
Or I'll put that ass to rest, punk

[Chorus]

[Mr. Shadow]
It's a quater after 12
And I know the game well
Got to keep the clientel
So I sell the shit that smells
To hell I send you
And no once can defend you
The Lord can't hear your prayers
So a demon's what he sent you
Remember me the craziest
You know me by my allias
Those bitches that betray
Got the NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR
Your savior is diein
Mothafucka stop tryin
I'm standin right behind ya
So lay on the ground
And stay quiet
You're cryin like a bitch
Beggin me to let you leave
Cause at home you got a wife
And a mothafuckin kid
I don't forgive I don't forget
I'll never let you disrespect
And if you do I'm after you
Now there ain't shit that you can do
Mothafucka I'm comin from down under
I'm makin fools wonder
Why I make em fall like thunder
Cause I'ma
Sick ass son of a witch
Grantin em death wishes
Bitches be blowin them death kisses
Quick to be dismissin
You ghost
And then I give a toast
I suppose
To the many dead thugs
Who lived their lives as kriminals
And then I give a grin
After doin all my sins
Second month of 99
Is when this hell on earth begins
Mothafucka

[Chorus]</pre>
