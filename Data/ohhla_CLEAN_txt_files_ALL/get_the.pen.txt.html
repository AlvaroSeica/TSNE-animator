Aiyo Pen, what's going on man

No doubt, no doubt
[ Jay Allen ]
They think this thing is a joke, you feel me
[ Penhead ]
Yeah I feel you, I feel you
[ Jay Allen ]
Don't understand half of this shit, knawmean?

All that, you need to understand all that
[ Penhead ]
Statuatory rate, everything
[ Jay Allen ]
Youknawmsayin

Cause if they don't, they just gon' get taken under
[ Penhead ]
No doubt

[ Penhead ]
This avenue's to use to travel through this music
Business, we choose independent
Lose the gimmick, this jewel's splendid to use infinite
The chemistry of success, collect assets for these talents
See that it's a blessing not to be neglected
By any record execs, we destined for glory
Words exit the respitory, check the steps before me

[ Jay Allen ]
I been in this game for years
The struggle showed me the meaning of blood, sweat and tears
Stood strong in my square
Learn the politics of the game and all that come with it
But through all the BS I stay committed
Now it's all about negotiations and boardroom meetings
Royalties, publishing, creative freedom
Lookin out for my peoples, mainly my artists
No matter what the deal, we gon' eat regardless
Whether it's independent, major or mini-major
If we get this business we can get this paper
Whether it's independent, major or mini-major
If we get this business we can get this paper

[ Jay Allen ]
Yo, youknawmean?
Yo, this business is real crazy
Cats need to understand it, youknawmsayin?
The publishing, youknawmsayin?
Even just the independent thing that we be doin
Cats needs to understand it

[ Penhead ]
There's lessons to be learned, try not to burn bridges
When your main concern is business
Negotiations can turn into bitter disputes
Don't panic, just re-group, discuss recoups
The numbers play a major role
Keep creative control, so every record sold
Shows you have great potential
To make a influential impact on the music the world listens to

[ Jay Allen ]
Yo, we gotta be prepared with a team
You better have your team
You better have your foundation first
In this game, you understand what I'm sayin to you?
Business management, entertainment terms, all that, gotta be prepared

[ Penhead ]
Be prepared for boardroom meetings
Got the proper ingredients to reach agreements
Legal representation is a must
When discussing million dollar contracts you need back-up
Please do research, read the words of experts
Constantly network, it takes hard work
To make an end but once you're there
You gotta keep pushin, never give up
Remember this business is corrupt
White collar crimes, illegal stick-ups
Can end up bankrupt if you don't take the necessary precautions
Know your market, the business's heartless

[ Penhead ]
Yeah
and as a artist, man, on some real
I think Higher Realm's comin through
they schoolin they, they peoples to this game
This game is real out here
and they ain't sendin none of they peoples out blind-folded
that's why I think shit's real where I'm at, youknawmean?
We gon' keep this thing movin cause we gon' get the business
Youknawmsayin?
[ Jay Allen ]
That's the only way to do it, baby</pre>
