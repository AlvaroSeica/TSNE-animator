MY RHYME...
OH, OH, OH, OH

[Esoteric]
Awaken my conscience with my rhyme by my side
My name is Esoteric and I'm all the way live
Me and my rhyme so exact, we always on the attack
We be blindin competition like we was a cataract
Oh yes a deadly combination, a rappin sensation
Me and my rhyme are kings of creation
A dynamic duo, a titanic tandem
We never liked our boss (SO WHAT'D YOU DO?) we canned him
We rock the mic at 11 tonight
So we step to Lafeyette to get some gear that is tight
And after that we hit the court for some one on one
It doesn't matter who wins, because it's only for fun
Me and my rhyme we hit the shower, before we hit the stage
To rock the microphone and leave the crowd in a daze
And when we're done with that we hittin Wendy's in Lindh
Cause the drive-through's open til 4 A.M.
MY RHYME! {*echoes*}</pre>
