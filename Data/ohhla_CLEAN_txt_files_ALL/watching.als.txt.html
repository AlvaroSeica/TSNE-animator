Intake ambiance a tool for meditation
Progressing towards the clouds with at whom I am complete
Defeat the chains that restrain an eager sensation
Equal balance in and out, all inhibitions shall deplete
(X2)

I'm trying to break this writer's cramp, massage my hand and daydream
Out the window innuendo, watch the water find it's path down the glass
It seems, erratic direction, it's only perfection
Rest my head inside my hands, pace back and forth inside my mind
I wish sometimes I wouldn't reminisce so much
such things, tend to make one reflect and dissect situations to an extreme
Hard now to redeem what was there before
No more gone are those days and ways have parted
Gone from feeling solid trust to outsmarted
Anyway, I'm now moving on to a distance far from yesterday
It's best this way
I feel as though I've missed this moment of truth
Outcome uneventfull. I've lost the ability to feel sentimental
I can stare at a  puddle and see a million places I love
It's comforting thoughts of places I've been, places I will never see again
Send my love to all who were there, wishing I could crawl back in
But I've transformed and the pieces wouldn't fit, so the sorenecks will cease
Eyes searching to the sky to try to find some form of peace
And I keep pulling up blanks, yet I'm wearing this mask for the sake of others
We all miss things I suppose, we must let go, well I'm not ready
Just let me sit in silence and soak in what's trailing down the window
to cleanse my emotions, to begin the process of preparing myself

I watch the drop join it's friends and become one with the crowd
All to well, forcing me to sigh out loud
Look into clouds, to envision, the inside of my head
I'm turing leave at this turning point. Remembering what they said
as they drove off one by one
they left taking pieces of me untill I felt empty inside
already looking forward to that day when I'd be returning
and I hadn'r even left yet
From then on I took the inside out approach
Granted lots of time to think when when your new position is coach
And your crew is sleeping the whole time, when it's 2:00 am in the morning
And you're in the middle of nowhere with the buzz of the AM radio
the only one that's there
Think a lot about life, that's where it all began for me
the more I thought, the more more I began to clearly see
absolutely every aspect of life in a new light
I figured out my Rubix Cube.. (haha) well I got it somewhat right
And things are coming together as I slowly come undone
And the occurence known as the "it" is swept under the rug
and now my burden weights a ton
But it only makes me stronger and I refuse to break
I'm letting things pass by, for the family's sake
Just give me a picture of the truth so I can hold it near
and watch the rainfall, syncopated with one lonesome tear
