{Fading in}
...Bawitdaba, da bang, da dang diggy diggy 
diggy, said the boogie, said up jump the boogie [Get ready.]

My name is Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid - Kid Rock!

Chorus: 

Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy 
shake the boogie said up jump the boogie [Love someone!] 
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy 
shake the boogie said up jump the boogie [Come on!]

And this is for the questions that don't have an answer
The midnight glances
And the topless dancers
The can of freaks
Cars packed with speakers
The G's with the forty's
And the chicks with beepers
The northern lights
And the Southern Comfort
And it don't even matter if your veins are punctured
All the crackheads, the critics, the cities
And all my heroes at the methodone clinics
All you bastards at the I.R.S.
For the crooked cops and the cluttered desks
For the shots of Jack and the caps of meth
Half pints of love and a fifth of stress
All the hookers that are tricking out in Hollywood
And for my hoods of the world misunderstood
I said it's all good and it's all in fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone!

Chorus

For the time bombs clicking and the heads they hang
All the gangs gettin' money and the heads they bang  - bang
Wild mustangs
The porno flicks
All my homies in the county in cell block six
The grits when there ain't enough eggs to cook
And to D.B. Cooper and the money he took
You can look for answers but that ain't fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone!

Chorus [Come on!] 
Chorus [Love and the hate. For the peace -warrrrrrrrrrrrr!] 
Chorus [Come onnnnnnnnnnnnn!] 
Chorus [Ha ha ha heh.]</pre>
