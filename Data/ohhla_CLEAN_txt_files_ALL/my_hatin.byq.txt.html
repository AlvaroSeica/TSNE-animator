{*NyQuil Man*}
Nigga just be wantin all the hoes sometimes

I ain't tryin to be your nigga, what you playin fo'?
Okay okay okay okay
Came up from the bottom yeah that Hoover Figg
Real life fifty niggaz, so I like 'em thick
And by lookin at your curves, you what I deserve
We can head up to the crib old girl just say the word
Got some purp, got some Henny, got my penis too
Have you ignorin his calls when you fuck with Q
Drop your panties to the flo', down below your feet
Spread them pretty legs and shit let me see
Hey~! You should fuck with me huh?
Yeah, yeah!

[Interlude]
Man that nigga, that nigga he can't protect ya
Remember when he had left ya?
You took him back from that heffer and then he did it again
And tried to fuck on your friend and got caught up once with your kin

Shit thirsty for the bitches, saggin my pants and shit
Paid this much for the belt, I better crack a bitch

[ScHoolboy Q]

I heard it's for a show, but let me call my hoe
They be like, "Bitch you bet' not be out with them niggaz!"

Got me swag from head to toe
Ten times I ain't gotta hate, she know that my paper grown
Polo shirts and Polo drawers, Polo socks they matchin too
Ooh, with the finest weed I show you what these O.G.'s do
Super duper triple O, can't see me with a telescope
I just wanna dick her down, tell me what's the verdict though
I just swag so fuckin hard she bringing up her nigga
(Fuck yo nigga) I beats the pussy up
Girl you my main contender (fuck yo' nigga, huh?) Yeah

[Interlude]
See you keep bringin up him and then he be hanging with them
And then they be hangin with her when he really should be wit'chu
What I do, see he can't do, this is true
You should tell that nigga you through

Shit I don't know; shit I had to nigga
The bitch was bad nigga, shit

Fresh up out the studio like can I live? (Can I live?)
Looking for a hoe so I can break her ribs (break her ribs)

A rack of condoms and some fire, girl lit
Now dim the lights and let me see you do your shit
{Face down, ass up} fuck me good
Cause cain't no nigga out here fuck you like I could
Grip you by your hair and waist, pillow to face
Satisfaction at it's highest point, I set the stakes
Plus your nigga over there with Tammy n'em
Giving that bitch all your time, why you deal with him?
