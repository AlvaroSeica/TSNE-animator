[ VERSE 1 ]
Calm when I speak, hard as concrete
Seven days without prayer make one weak
Get it? One week
She a young freak, witty, unique physique
So sweet, so chic
Shoppin on Newbury Street at every boutique
Brain surgeon, she can headshot 'em for the red bottoms
You can never say the Ed bought 'em
Watch Ed spot 'em, fatherless daughters
Y'all lookin for dimes, not dollars
She always by herself, don't need no friends
She don't come to play, she come to win
When you with her you get immersed
Let her choose her purse
She don't come in dancin, hear the music first
She attracted to you and your wealth
She a fire, homeboy, that light itself

[ CHORUS ]
She about (bags and shoes)
Homie, it could give you the blues
Let me give you the news
That girl about (bags and shoes)
She win, she never lose
Pick and choose
Any kinda (bags and shoes)
Homie, it could give you the blues
Let me give you the news
That girl about (bags and shoes)
Pick and choose

[ VERSE 2 ]
Mama told her to be much smarter
She's somewhere in Nevada, addicted to Prada
Ass-naked in the Ramada
She giving up the whole enchilada
Pimin ain't easy, hoein is harder
Young daughter not knowin her father
Wanna blow up like a martyr
She a midnight marauder
Little bathing suit, she sittin next to the water
High fashion, loves smashin
Go to war with a passion, end up with a K-ration
Vegas, New York, Hollywood, no compassion
You with her, you better cash in
Put your foot down, she put her ass in
She's the industry unmaskin - everybody askin
Who is she? One hundred all real
A compliment to her is like a kiss to a deal
