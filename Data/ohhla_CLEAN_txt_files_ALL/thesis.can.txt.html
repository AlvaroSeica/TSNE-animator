This is the master thesis underneath the deepness
Come to micclub.net where you can read this
run a plot on a map hyper space 'ya
From the society for scientific exploration
color is vibration, vibration is sound
sound resonates through the mouth check it out
What I say vibrates no less than 9 ways
South, South East, West, south west, east
North, North east, North west
And the black and white images fade
to great sound waves
Track my adversaries like a mouse in a maze
with a bewildering array, of lyrical display
The best of Bis oftenly rearrange
Moto atomic elements, with a deft intelligence
The highest professorship, my English etiquette
compels me to not say it if I can't spell it bitch
My circularised 3rd Eye, sees all
Atlantis was surrounded by 4 sea walls
I read one-fourth of the Library of Alexandria
before it was burnt to the floor
I wish I could've learned more
about the shapes of the sacred geometry they used to draw
They were new millennium but Euclidian in form
ancient in many ways but not nearly as old
Carved from Egyptian gold molded in Assyria
with processed Beryllium by the quintillion
They cooked on symmetrical stoves
with my logo etched above the hole where they inserted the coal
And they barbecued birds to the bone
They burned incense in a Buck Mister Fuller type dome
I talked to Mr. Fuller over the phone
and he said he had a contract to rebuild Rome
said he didn't want to do it alone
I told him I was busy writing poems
but I'll think about going
The process was slow, and the dough was low
but I took it as the perfect opportunity to grow
plus I never traveled that far from home
but I heard about the beauty of Sydonian (city of ancient Phoenicia) snow
neon green grass, statues made from translucent glass
I'll be crazy to pass
I like nigerian Jazz
the blue twilight band
that plays tunes from a laser black sax
it sounds so laid back
it helps me relax
I brought the album after seeing K-Pax
Ooh how I miss my nautilus
i was told faren goat and mcdotilus did not exist
you have a modest case of scaphocephalous
I prescribe some neo gothic anti-biotics
words concocted from the lyrical lock smith
deadly as 10 droplets of Ricin toxin
from every angle the competition gets boxed in
its Dr. C indoctrinates his doctrine
translate the English alphabet
to the omega text
life is now and death is next
post bond out on bail from the belly of hell
communicate through diatonic and pentatonic scale
these dark side tales might affect sales
I set sail and hunt down erect sperm whales
use the aphrodisiac to get a female
call ginger tie her up and drink her ginger ale
grand maryey for me scotch on the rocks for you
your vocab is smaller than a cup of jewels
in the studio with james lipton
reminiscing about the script that was written
before the beginning
all of a sudden the boo's turned into applause
my jaws stronger then the kenenday Macaws
cant even count the bars
i've expended so far
don't want to rap no more its been so long
i wish the clock would hurry up and tick
im out in the bush and the sticks
humpin a hundred clicks
dr scholes gave me a good fit
me and him went to school together back in 86
when I was really ill
puttin flank energy in a rhyme the size of a Tylenol pill
you wanna laugh now
and cast your belligerent doubt
show you what poetry is really about
the side affects will make you pass out
followed by skin rash
itching diarrhea nausea and dry mouth
you want a time out?
you better spit a rhyme out
before the community of real mc's die out
college students say to me "you ain't smart"
Record label A&amp;Rs say: "this ain't art"
these are the contents of the covenant of the art
listen to my chest beat tell me this ain't heart
You gotta be as obsequious
as the Disciples of Jesus
this is my MASTER THESIS</pre>
