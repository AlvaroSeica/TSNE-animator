[Verse 1]
A new day dawns and it still ain't rained
And some say the planet earth still ain't changed
I wonder what they make of the extended summers
And storms that don't stop 'til the whole town's under
Seems we all just do what we feel like
Do whatever feels good - not what feels right
Not sure why but we've sacrificed foresight
Blinded by the lights of these television screens
I want to hear the television scream
Instead of reading us the small print of big business deals
Imagine how your kids would feel growing up
Skin burning up each day, heat wave never slowing up and sure enough
The powers that be create argument
But that's a childs game, we both know who started this
You once made a promise, I hope you can remember it
COs we've got no choice but to accept this inheritance

[Chorus: Jane Tyrell] {Vocals}
Look what we inherited
This is what we inherited
How can we say thank you
If you won't let us open our mouth?
Look what we inherited
This is what we inherited
How can we say thank you
If you won't let us open our mouth?

[Verse 2]
Can't you understand how the modern man was made insane?
When his plans for the future feel made in vain?
When anyone who makes a stand gets chopped at the knees?
Unarmed protesters shot by police
Then reports switch name-tags - we're the enemies
It's a *bad education* when you can't afford the fees
The pieces of this pie could feed forty thieves
If you've never smelt the greed you're a little na√Øve
And a little like me, back when I was 18
Before I saw blood spilt for an Australian dream
It was your blood, my blood
OhLord wise up, rise up and see how they're blundering your kingdom
But second coming never came it's a shame that if God don't exist then that
makes you insane
He'll discipline his children with the force of the elements
And we've got no choice but to accept his inheritance

[Chorus]
Look what we inherited
This is what we inherited
How can we say thank you
If you won't let us open our mouth?
Look what we inherited
This is what we inherited
How can we say thank you
If you won't let us open our mouth?

[Verse 3]
We all in this together, so keep digging your grave so we can fall in
together
Climbing out would give in to pressure
Have you ever had the guts to admit we don't live forever?
No cure for denial, praise for false idols
Easy to get dizzy on a downward spiral
Still blockout, can't blockout the burning truth
The sins of the father revisit the youth
It's a black and white issue now that green turned brown
Red faced when I think about how we turned out
Owed the world everything, we dying in debt
Life's a mirror that reflects what's under the flesh
And there isn't an alternative to breath
Believe this alternative energy is our alternative to death
But I'm a sinner too, sense regret in my sentiment
All I wanna do is thank you for this inheritance

[Chorus]
Look what we inherited
This is what we inherited
How can we say thank you
If you won't let us open our mouth?
Look what we inherited
This is what we inherited
How can we say thank you
If you won't let us open our mouth?
