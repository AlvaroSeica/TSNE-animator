Yeah

[Verse 1]
you call me at work, so I know you got a something to say
well hurry up, I only got a few minutes left on my lunch break
you take a deep breath, then say I don't know if you're ready
I said your my girl, so we both know you better tell me
she said weve' been together for so long
In thinking in my head, what has this women done wrong
the phone, it went quiet. I screamed out come on
she said, we are going to be a little family
congratulations baby you're' going to be a daddy

[Chorus]
do you mean what think you mean [?]
she said yeah, were having a baby (yes)
and I couldnt' be more excited
I said do you know what this means to me to hear you say that you're having my baby
(yeah) and I wouldn't' wanna share this joy with anyone but you

[Verse 2]
I can't' believe I'm going to be a dad, going to give my kid what inever had
never walk out the door on his mother, cause I love ya
It's' going to take 9 months to make it. but a lifetime of raising
oooh this is such a blessing, a little piece of love from the heavens
I pray the doctor says that all is good I swear we going move out this hood girl
tell your people that I got us and that's a promise

[Hook]
so girl we've been together for so long
every trial weve' been through has made us so strong
I'm so sure, I know you'll be the worlds best mom
I know you will hold up baby this is real

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
you see straight up, it's like chance of a lifetime
probably won't sleep much in the nighttime
but it's cool cause we added on the lifeline
I'm so lucky the light shinned on you
from the moment I seen you I knew there was something different
always knew that you'd be the one I'd have my kids with
now it's all coming true
baby it's so beautiful
having a baby
Wouldn't want to share this joy with anyone but you</pre>
