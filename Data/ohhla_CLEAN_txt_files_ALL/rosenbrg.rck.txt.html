What a beautiful day has been at Bethshalom, Miami
I'm rabbi Peter Rosenberg and I wanna congratulate our bar mitzvah Ricky Rosay
I've never seen a service so lavish
I've never seen such a spread like the lunching provided by wing stop
So delicious and we thank you
Never have I seen such beautiful titties hanging out at a bar mitzvah service before
But it's appropriate because today, Ricky, you are a man
And you will enjoy the fruits that come with being a man
And that's why tonight we will all be out together with the MMG family
and all of Rick's friends at the beautiful King of Diamonds gentlemen's club
to celebrate, to have a nosh and to enjoy each other's company
Ricky now that you are bar mitzvah, what would you like to say to the community?</pre>
