layin on my back in the dungeons of darkness
freak oh terrorized, paralized by the heartless (?)
where do I go from here?, from the bottom lookin up
for T, and mentally shooken up
As I sit and meditate I'm mad
that I ended up in the place like this, I stay like this
photographic mind travelin through time
monkey past race saggin red flaggin at my nine (?)
God called my name and I came to his beck and call
He was gripped, and God had me jackin the Law
He told me that he died for me, he cried for me
sat on the Father's side for me and Satan lied to me
accepted Christ in my life, everything fell in place
Now the Secret Place of the Most High is my dwellin place
secured for sure, just keep my thoughts pure
never thought I would endure, allow myself to be allured
In my mind, Satan inclined me to a penacle
strapped on trap, found myself locked in sin's tentacles
tryin to escape the clutch but its a spiritual rut
got me stuck like Chuck, plus lust had me handcuffed
guilty, eternal damnation was my sentence
And my last and final hope was repentence
had a large debt yet Christ came to pay all
sin had me prisoned but The Blood had me AWOL
chains was broke, flames of smoke, all around me
As me and Christ walked the main line like the county
free as a bird and that's the word so go repent
But Jesus Christ 4 life, ha, so it flewa (?)
I'm out the dungeons

whom the Son sets free is free indeed
And if you want Salvation then he got what you need
And here's the testimony on a how I got free
And now that I'm free, I'm free indeed, indeed, indeed
I'm Saved, no longer a slave
And I ain't givin up the grunions, I'm out the dungeons of darkness
I'm Saved, no longer a slave
And I ain't givin up the grunions, I'm out the dungeons of darkness
I'm Saved, no longer a slave
And I ain't givin up the grunions, I'm out the dungeons of darkness
whom the Son sets free is free indeed
And if you want Salvation then he got what you need
And here's the testimony on a how I got free
And now that I'm free, I'm free indeed, indeed, indeed
They wanna keep me silenced, I wonder why they try this
keep me in the darkest dungeon just like they did Paul and Silas
Midas touch by the hand of light, like a candle light
In the grand of night a voice said "stand and fight"
I heard the keys hit the ground
the echo sensation of the impact, made me look around
I seen the key shining, it was blinding
I had to escape, make my break, but it takes timing
see sentence like a jail cell, the only bail
is the scars from 4 holes and 3 nails
I'm not the tail so I fled, I'm the head, so instead
I plead the Liquid Bread that was shed when he bled
Now open up the gates of Hell
cant wait to tell the testimony to peers how God got me outta here
I'm breakin, takin, no time to waste
too late to make a chase cause I just scaled the gates by Grace
I'm standing in the Face of The Amighty
doin the right thing like Spike Lee
slightly bruised, remove my shoes, cause my toes got bunions
But grateful that he got me out the dungeons
I'm out the dungeons
whom the Son sets free is free indeed
And if you want Salvation then he got what you need
And here's the testimony on a how I got free
And now that I'm free, I'm free indeed, indeed, indeed
I'm Saved, no longer a slave
And I ain't givin up the grunions, I'm out the dungeons of darkness
I'm Saved, no longer a slave
And I ain't givin up the grunions, I'm out the dungeons of darkness
I'm Saved, no longer a slave
And I ain't givin up the grunions, I'm out the dungeons of darkness</pre>
