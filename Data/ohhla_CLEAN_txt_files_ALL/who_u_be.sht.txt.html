[Intro/Chorus]
(Who you be) Kids don't know me
But they show me they really don't wanna make it man
(Who you be)
So I only give that good work knowin I'ma take it man
(Who you be)
Where I want to, yeah I'm broke too so ain't no shakin man
(Who you be)
Watch me rise and drop these lines like who's waitin man

[Verse One]
Wait, bring it back let's go
Ill state of light weight and nights across this globe
The process flow like countin years, we at it again
Embedded in sin, bet we get that cheddar and grin
When we (swerve, when we perv) that's what we need to be on
The whole city as one, that's what we need to be strong
Stop bleedin for charms, niggaz out here squeezin them arms
Blackin chrome, back at home, spitters need to be on
They hustlers, niggaz dyin to get rich
I'm applyin this big stick to the paper for big chips
Flip thick, cause I got no other option for scratch
The itch in my palm, got me contemplatin the strap
Like (blaow, like blaow) yeah watch out pow
I got a fetish for that fetti, fin' to dump out rounds
My gun is powerful, if I were you I'd duck out now
Cause I'm heated and I'm weeded plus I punk out clowns like

[Chorus]

[Outro]
One two one two, my nigga {?} on the beat
