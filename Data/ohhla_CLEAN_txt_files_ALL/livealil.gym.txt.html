[Travie McCoy]
Can you feel the urgency? Like a needle pulling out
Can you feel the urgency?
Pulses of anxiety; we're just faces in the crowd
Pulses of anxiety - ohhh!
Are these the lies that we've been taught to believe?
Are these the lives that we have opted to lead? Uh-oh, uh-oh

[Chorus]
Staring at the clock
I hear each tick and tock
And they whisper that I've lost the race
but I won't fucking stop
I'll hold you by my side
I need you here tonight
Cause if we're gonna lose this thing
we're going out in style

[Travie McCoy]
Time replace reality
Now we're peeking through the hours, time replace reality
So I grasp for sanity, I refuse to be devoured
So I grasp for sanity
Are these the lies that we've been taught to believe?
Are these the lives that we have opted to lead? Uh-oh, uh-oh

[Chorus]
