what you need? something stole for you? something to hold for you?
need someone that you can blame shit on? someone to quit on?
need a job done or somethin? tryin to find some yay-yay-yo?
you lookin for some dirty work and I'm your way to go?
you need a gun or somethin? oh, you lookin for a tittie bar?
you just tryin to hang with someone who's uglier than you are? (shit)
well, I'm your motherfucker, I'm that motherfuckin' motherfuckers
in scrubby time, let me be your scrubby brother, cuz...

[Chorus]
I do this all the time (it's the way of my life)
I do this all the time (everyday of my life)
I do this all the time (it's the way of my life)
I do this all the time (everyday of my life)

what you lookin for now? a window broke? a neck choked?
I know you ain't already out, fuck, all of that you smoked
you a clucker, and I'm your fuckin cluckin brother
I know you fucked that hooker, you couldn't tell no other
I'm always fuckin hookers, call me when you feelin' wicked
and we can chill down in the gutters, get dirty, and kick it
cuz I'm your motherfucker, I'm that motherfuckin motherfuckers
in scrubby time, let me be your scrubby brother cuz...

[Chorus]
I do this all the time (it's the way of my life)
I do this all the time (everyday of my life)
I do this all the time (it's the way of my life)
I do this all the time (everyday of my life)

you need a fuckin hitman who the shit with a quick plan?
a shoulder to cry on, get high or die on, maybe?
you tryin to disappear to the seedy side of the city
for an hour, a night, or forever, playa? just hit me
you need somebody's ass kicked? someone you after?
you want me to take the risk of doing time so that you don't have to?
well that's me, motherfuckers, I'm that motherfuckers
in scrubby time, let me be your scrubby brother cuz...

[Chorus]
I do this all the time (it's the way of my life)
I do this all the time (everyday of my life)
I do this all the time (it's the way of my life)
I do this all the time (everyday of my life)

if you tryin to hide a dead body (clown love)
hit me up (clown love) hit me up (clown love)
if you tryin to smuggle china white (clown love)
hit me up (clown love) hit me up (clown love)
if you tryin to buy a tank gun (clown love)
hit me up (clown love) hit me up (clown love)
if you breakin someone outta prison (clown love)
hit me up (clown love) hit me up (clown love)
hit me up...

[Chorus]
I do this all the time (it's the way of my life)
I do this all the time (everyday of my life)
I do this all the time (it's the way of my life)
I do this all the time (everyday of my life)

(it's the way of my life) I do this (everyday of my life) all the time
(it's the way of my life) all the time (everyday of my life)
(it's the way of my life) everyday of my life all the time
(it's the way of my life) all the time (everyday of my life)</pre>
