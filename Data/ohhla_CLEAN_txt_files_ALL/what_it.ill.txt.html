Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Illogic]
I don't know what you thought you had or what you got
But yo, to be an MC it takes a lot
Are you willin to take the responsibility of this quest
cause if you do it right you might not have nothin left

[Illogic]
Yo, it takes artistic ability and knowhow lyrically
to express in forms of poetical wizardry
It takes rhythmic structures and phenomenal thoughts
It takes creation of hooks on which the wack can get caught
It takes knowledge of self and creator
It takes payin attention to that music in the elevator and elevatin
If you call yourself a lyrical surgeon it takes patients/patience
It takes takin a trip with God on that ship of relation
It takes self-denial AND realization
It takes keepin it realistic
Not real just to become a statistic
It takes evolution and edification
It takes a person, it takes a family, takes a city, it takes a nation
It takes surroundin sound, not lettin sound surround you
It takes surroundin yourself with fam and a dope crew
It takes hot tracks and it takes hot use of words
I don't about you but for me it took a third

[Chorus] - 2X

[Illogic]
Yo, it takes a sense of focus and clear mindstate
It takes shape and destiny and acceptin fate
It takes you takin a stand and not conceit
It takes you bein and actin like a man and not a beast
It takes squashin beef
It takes, treating our women like queens and men like kings
It takes replacement of material with spiritual things
It takes a one for education and lack of stupidity
It takes discovering your faults and seeking a remedy
It takes some illogical thinking in this rational world
It takes passiveness and confontation, rebellion and confirmation
It takes, an open and a closed mind
It takes a lack of compromise and, findin some truth in lies
It takes healin, it takes booze and it takes tryin
It takes winnin, it takes losin, it takes livin , it takes dyin
It takes them, it takes us, it takes you what takes me
These are the essentials I think it takes to be an MC

[Chorus] - 2X

[Illogic]
I'm an MC cause I got what it takes
Are you an MC, do you have what it takes?
If you don't know, I've defined it
So go ahead kid, and just rewind it
I'm an MC cause I got what it takes
Are you an MC, do you have what it takes?
If you don't know, I've defined it
So go ahead kid, and just rewind it

"Clap your hands everybody, if you got what it takes" -&gt; KRS-One
