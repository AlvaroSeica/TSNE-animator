Song:   Speech Impediment
Typed by: @MidaZ

Speech impediment never headed him off
To competitors I be wanting to bless em before they cough
Stalking these niggas, seeking to stick a fork in these niggas, battle?
Shit i don't even wanna talk to these niggas
Honest question somebody tell me how is it was raised in florida
since 5 and qualified to bring new york to these niggas
sizing my opponents, analyzing they components
fantasizing about the moment, that I'm holding em
by they jugular vein, knuckle near where they belt buckle hang
snatch it from ya frame and juggle ya brain
Listen Gordo
allow me to inform you I'm immortal
Using Freudian philosophy to mold me in Portal
Presiding over my assignments, combining my alliance
Extra loop on the tape I decided to rhyme in silence on it
U find it and correctly tell me a bar from it and you aren't hunted
Gun not girl if I start dumping hope your all ducking
Verses terrorizing a terrorist, Verizon Wireless hired for organizing my merit list.....Feeding the needy food of a Deity
Its a B&amp;E easily, eagerly use my TNT
Freakishly strong, chillin with bitches in thongs doing wrong, yawn
Its hard for y'all to even get me alarmed
Raising a flag red for the murder
Stop this
Raping the beats
Roethlisberger
Soon ill be changing my name
Not to tell where I'm from but the reason for which i came
For harming these niggas mayne....</pre>
