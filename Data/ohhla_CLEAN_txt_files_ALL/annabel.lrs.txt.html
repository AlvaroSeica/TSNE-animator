[Intro]
We got E.A.P. in the house tonight
Edgar Allan Poe
America's most dramatic love poet
We're takin this back, way back, 1849 style
Hip-Hop? Nah, this is LIT-Hop

[MC Lars]
It was many and many a year ago
in a kingdom by the sea (it's true)
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me
But the angels got jealous they took my queen
now she's gone and I can barely sleep
But her, mortality makes her hot
All up in the malt shop - her favorite spot
I got so lost in her bright green eyes
So tell me why the love of my life had to die
So who's that (who's that) rapping at my door?
Annabel Lee, R.I.P., like Lenore
Nevermore should have known that death would take her out
Red lips, sick kiss and I'm lonely now
(It was) tuberculosis, necrosis
I can't focus, and I hope this
pain goes away, cause all I see
is her photo on the wall smell her perfume on the sheets
We were so in love, even when she's gone
I'll be up in the graveyard singin her songs
Like cemetary woman, my cemetery girl
Cemetery lady, I want you in my world

[Chorus]
No matter what way you go
No matter which way you stay
You're out of my mind, out of my mind
Out of my mind, out of my mind

[MC Lars]
I was a child and she was a child
in this kingdom by the sea
But we loved with a love that was more than love see
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the wing-ed, seraphs of heaven
coveted her and me
She was gone by dawn should have known all along
that we were never meant to be (sadly)
I gave her my heart, she gave me her flower
Like Romeo and Juliet, humpin in the tower
Every single day, every single hour
Rumpy in the bedroom, pumpy in the shower
So now I pack a shovel and I dig real deep
Take a crescent wrench, rip out all her teeth
Put 'em in a box so she'll always be
here with me let's see probably need some therapy
The highborn kingmen stole her from me
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee
That's Death I guess, there's nothing I can do
Like Ronnie and Sammie our relationship is through
Now every single night, I lie down by the side
of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride
My wife and my pride, now all I have left
is poetry, memories, sorrow and stress

[Chorus]

[MC Lars]
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
of the beautiful Annabel Lee
And neither the angels in heaven above
nor the demons down under the sea
can ever dissever my soul from the soul
of the beautiful Annabel Lee
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
of those who were older than we
They said we were kids, but I know what love is
We were happy and young and so free
And so every night, I lie down by the side
of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride
That's where she will always be
In her tomb, by the sounding sea {*sighs*}</pre>
