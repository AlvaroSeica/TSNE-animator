[Verse 1]
It's wrath when silence cease, I'll clash with the devil
Last of a dying breed, I'm half of the perils 					
Turn laughter to trembles, you're smashed cause the massacre's 
Dreadful dont stand in the path of the rebel				
At last it is settled, I gasped caused I mastered
The mental I sat at the mass in the temple				
Angered and vengeful, the horror's painful
Grapple and wrestle, the fallen angels					
My aura's fatal, kill your descendants
I'm more then hateful, filled with resentment					
Thrilled with the vengeance, blood is curled
Revealing the entrance, of underworld						
The hunter hurls his arrows, bringing crisis
You're hunged and twirled in gallows, swinging lifeless					
You're lost in terror, the grimmest seance
The fortune teller predicted chaos					
The witches gray pot is hot when it boils
I'll dig your grave plot, you'll rot in the soil					
My saga is royal, The worse assassin
You heard the slashing at murder mansion					
Drove the stake through the heart of the vampire
Lone escapes and departs on the hand-glider				
War with the goblins, internal struggle
Gommorah and sodom, is burned to rubble					

[Verse 2]
Held lavish swords from El Salvador
You felt havoc from hell's savage dogs				
Spells, magic orbs, the chilling warlock
You wail the saddest mourns and feel the floor drop			
The squealing door locks at haunted house
Heard morbid shouts, you wanted out					
I'm sipping the reddest rum, the pit 
And the pendulum, you're wicked your end will come		 
Arsenal unloads, I slash hombre
carnival of souls on black sunday  				
I dance on graves and smash tombstones
Surpass gloom, I pass through zones				
From the town that dreaded sundown
You heard the sound of beheadings, dumbfound			 
Seven priests each hold a dagger of Megiddo
Heaven weeps, behold the madness of the ghetto		
Mutilated victims, Lone will cut, slash
Ghouls invade the kingdom, total blood bath				
Torch your squadron, I stalk in the torture 
Garden you soft  so Of course you're dodging			
The next moon rise and there's chirping ravens
Let you die if you worship satan				
The strange door leads to a dungeon cell
It's pain, gore you bleed and you want to yell</pre>
