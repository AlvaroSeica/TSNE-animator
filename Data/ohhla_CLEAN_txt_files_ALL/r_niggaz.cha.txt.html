[Chamillionaire]
Look..
My car sittin' as low as the IQ of kids on short yellow busses
Comin' slow like a cripple handicap kid, on crutches
Got more ice then Miller Light and a 100,000 slushes
Got somethin' in my clutches made for niggaz holdin' grudges
Poppa lookin' for a bootlegger I can abuse tonight
My princess got cut and I ain't even used a knife
You want me to lose my life, because you know you'll lose ya wife
When ya see me, you'll try to fight and then you'll be a loser twice
You as broke as the answering machine that never wants to answer
All eyes on me like the tat on a top-less tittie dancer
Is Chamillion cheap? Yeah..Enn nigga wrong answer
Screen fall's bout to Reign-Deer like Glitchen and Prancer
Ya misses wishes to give me kisses and be my Mrs'
Sit on more damn deep-dishes then some friend up..catfishes
I make myself laugh, twinkies out-crawlin' ya
I'm worth the price of a country so they call me Zamalia
You can call me baller trainer, when I tell ya I'm the boss
You want a verse and I don't like you, I'ma jack up my cost
I want a burger and a french fry, do that come with sauce?
I want a 'lac with a jumble-jack jack do that come with gloss?
We as throwed as a softball after the pitcher toss it
Paint wet as a leaky faucet, drippin' also when I floss
It's the..Chamillionaire, Hakim, Super Doopa King
Hoes say that I can sing, but I still do know bling

[Chorus - Papa Reu]
We got..hella TV's twinkies too
Call up Ron C when I need to be chopped &amp; screwed
Hoppin' out shinin' in ? to make em' bling
Watch me go bling bling, bling bling, so gleam
So please not ? from the gutta
???
