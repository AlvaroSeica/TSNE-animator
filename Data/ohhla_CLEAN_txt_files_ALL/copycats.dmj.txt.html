[CHORUS-Jemini]
Hey yo, some emcee's come to party, we goin' get it started
But ya'll emcee's act retarded on the microphone (repeatx2)

[CHROUS]
Every little thing we say, you say
Every little thing we do, you do
Every little thing we be, you be
But you don't see the things we see

[Prince Po]
Time and time again, dawg, I be usin' them
Confusin' em, copy cats, verbaly abusin' them
Still losin' em, too much of that bullshit be amusin' em
Step into these crews like (?) of Jeurusilm, like who was them
Mommy's call me the sexy holagent
Prince Po, callico flow, still schoolin' em

[Jemini the Gifted One]
Why, you aint try to copy everything I do
I do my best to be original, you try to do it to
Why, I try to get out of a rappers way and show curdosy
It's like a multitramaticly, you still aint follow me
(I'm not the type of rapper you should follow, your style goin inventility
to me a hollow tomorrow)
Hope you find the air a in your weist, cause you will use it
Get a therapist and be more thearputic
Lay down on the couch and tell him that your father Jem is becomin a problem
And I'm hopin you can solve em, is another in a circle
And is constantly revolving you, envolve an upsession thats connected to my lyrical
Express and learn your lesson, it can not jublicated
If you made it, good for you, but you were highly over-rated
Face it, every rhyme I cook, and now you want a taste
But it burns to the tounge cause it's hot like it's cajun
And I told you that my flow is jaw-blazen' (nigga)
Now you hurtin' like a hospital patient (nigga)
You better go n' ask somebody (nigga)
Jemini, Prince Poem in the party

Every little thing we say, you say
Every little thing we do, you do
Every little thing we be, you be
But you don't see the things we see

[Jemini the Gifted One]
The reality of watch'ya walk, could not be any clearer
When I see you it's like lookin in the mirror mirror
Mirror on the wall, you just a reflection
that a wat I used to be without a vote to perfection
Now ya do your style has been grafted
And after, havn't heard the master laughin at you, til ya catch it
F-e-e-ls like a little beeotch, but Prince, nobody told you to rhyme like this(shit)
Jeimini, my name and ya'll ain't gunna get it
You can put your foot in my shoe, but ain't gunna fit it

[Prince Po]
I peep your style, your technique is so weak n' mild
Your beneathe me B, I eat you child
And why you sleep us crocadiles still creepin now
20,000 other nigger's freakin' your style
And them gemicks is exile, you x-file
I batter n bruise and make shoes rip up the textile
Prince Po, hot flows, hood, runnin' wit it, gunnin' with it
And a whole block got what I got when I'm comin' wit it
Dumb, there ain't no frontin' in it
But you don't here me though, Jem holla, this shit is goin down
So baby here we go
Invade your routes
gernade your house
Bought a raze to joust
Prince, Jemini, and Danger Mouse

Every little thing we say, you say
Every little thing we do, you do
Every little thing we be, you be
But you don't see the things we see</pre>
