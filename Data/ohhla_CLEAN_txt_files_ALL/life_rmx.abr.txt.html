[Verse 1: Jesse Abraham]
Under fire cuz my style is undefined
I don't wonder why
Nevermind
I'm just stayin true
Unrefined all the while I'm inclined
Never slumber til I'm underground
Coffin like the flu
Often what I do troubles you
Utter through the top of my mind while y'all plottin like a coup
But I don't gotta think about, I just be about it, I should be up
outta here from talking like I do

[Hook: Jesse Abraham]
Life is a free throw
And I tell them all the same
It isn't a game
Ain't nobody standin in your way
Life is a free throw
And you ain't really gotta search for what you deserve
Long as you work, you're gonna earn
Life is a free throw
Every time I turn around somebody's throwin a pound
The value's going down
Life is a free throw
But I don't let it bother me
I keep movin logically
Ain't nobody stopping me
Life is a free throw

[Verse 2: Jesse Abraham]
Ain't no stayin the same or fadin away I'm just sayin my name
I'm changing the aim and aiming for fame?
Psyche, I'm just playin a game
Makin a change and I'm breakin away
Cookin tomorrow and bakin today
What can I say?
Stuck in a phase
Arts &amp; crafts
Papier-mâché
You could see me writin poems at my home like I'm Homer
Not Simpson, that's a misnomer
Think I miss homework?
No sir
I'm Icarus, closer to the sun than most are
I don't need a postmark on my letters
I don't need a loan shark, lendin money to my creditors
Editing my editors
Sentencing the predators
Sentences and characters and references to senators
No Clay Davis
Thou shalt remain nameless
I stay gracious
Over plates I say graces
Your aim's heinous
Shame on your playlist
Loquacious with statements I say that this

[Hook: Jesse Abraham]
Life is a free throw
And I tell them all the same
It isn't a game
Ain't nobody standin in your way
Life is a free throw
And you ain't really gotta search for what you deserve
Long as you work, you're gonna earn
Life is a free throw
Every time I turn around somebody's throwin a pound
The value's going down
Life is a free throw
But I don't let it bother me
I keep movin logically
Ain't nobody stopping me
Life is a free throw

[Verse 3: Marquis Daniels]
So why you think they freeload?
You ballin when you got it
When you broke, watch em get ghost
Hatin is a epidemic
Send them boys to the clinic
Too many island boys out here plottin on your Popeye spinach
She wanna throw it in the bag
Ballin' off of your cash
Need to wear a body caste
Stuntin' with her broke ass
Yeah, jet swag
I could change the forecast
Purple got you hooverin
Searchin for a money bag
Big talk, big money, big chips
Keep a grand hustle, yeah something like Tip
Early bird gets the worm, as the sayin go
Grab the worm before you put it in your pantyhose
Keep em high, no smoke, off of contact
Go hard in the paint, make em fall back
Bend your knees, take a breath, and aim at the hoop
If it's money that you're after, nigga go on shoot

[Hook: Jesse Abraham]
Life is a free throw
And I tell them all the same
It isn't a game
Ain't nobody standin in your way
Life is a free throw
And you ain't really gotta search for what you deserve
Long as you work, you're gonna earn
Life is a free throw
Every time I turn around somebody's throwin a pound
The value's going down
Life is a free throw
But I don't let it bother me
I keep movin logically
Ain't nobody stopping me
