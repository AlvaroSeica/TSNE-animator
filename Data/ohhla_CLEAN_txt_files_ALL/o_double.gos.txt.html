the Original Gospel Gangstas, 96 editin
sit back and listen

[Mr. Solo]
tryin to stay Saved in South Central
where survival is an everyday thing and it's weighin on my mental
everywhere you step brothas trying to get a rep
and they'll rold ya, fold ya, for a stripe on they shoulder
told ya that I used to fornicate like I was born to mate
now Jezebel wanna see if Solo really creep
well, now I watch my back when I bail
Cause theres alot a Delilahs out to cut your homie pigtails
as far as meetin in a joint of weed
gotta meet me at my point of need, so I plead
the Blood if I have to, don't let these demons grab you
watch till you inverse then kiss your face and backstab you
see frustration tried to beat me down, keep me down
said id never make it through, but peep me now
I got my homies, my vision, and I got God too
eyes to the skies, G's rise as I mobs through

O Double G's go on (on and on)
in the Lord, standin strong (everlasting)
O Double G's stand strong (stand strong)
Cause once again it's on (no need in asking)

It's been a long time comin, now were here
full gear, no fear, sheddin tears for my peers
down in my convergin, it cut me like a surgeon
said I'm no good for churchin, only good for servin
(see) the death in my mind for the Martial Arts is set-o
said id never make it cuz I grew up in a ghetto
attack my self esteem in a evil way
they'll kill your dreams if you listen to what people say
see God called me with a Holy callin
He snatched me out the gang and cleaned me up to witness to my homies bawlin
so don't get caught up in your past failures
when you feelin like you won't last, tell ya
self "ima make it" when satan say you can't take it
and if the spot get too hot shake it
Cause sometimes we all need some help
but when I feel like givin up I tell my self

O Double G's go on (youve gotta stand strong)
in the Lord, standin strong (everlasting) (lasting everything)
O Double G's stand strong (keep on movin)
Cause once again it's on (no need in asking)

a troubled youth from the CPT
it makes my family feel good when they see me free
I was wrote off, they said "leave him alone"
I had no love at home so I hugged my crome
through bad situations and tribulations
now God is using them to bring thousands to Salvation
ive been lied on by ignorance and jealousy
you got a problem with my crew just come and tell us G
it pierce us deeply, peep me, I mean it hurts, loc
to get dogged by your own, talk to church folk
bound to religion, quick to make decisions
about the Call of God in my life and the vision
but who but a x-Blood could reach a cobdu
you won't leave your pew then you criticize what I do
try to understand if you could
if not you can catch me in the hood
Cause I'm goin on
go on, go on

O Double G's go on (O Double G's go on)
in the Lord, standing strong (everlasting) (always stand strong)
go on, go on
O Double G's stand strong (stand strong, stand strong)
Cause once again it's on (no need in asking)   O Double G's go on
in the Lord, standing strong (standing strong) (everlasting)
O Double G's stand strong
Cause once again it's on (no need in asking)
(keep on standing, keep on standing)   O Double G's go on
in the Lord, standing strong (everlasting)
O Double G's stand strong
Cause once again it's on (no need in asking)
go on, go on, go on, go on, O Double G's
go on, go on, go on, stand strong, go on
go on, go on, go on, go on
go on, go on, go on, go on
go on</pre>
