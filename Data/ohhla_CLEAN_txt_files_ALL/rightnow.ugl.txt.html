One, two, what you gonna do?

[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin)
Hey! Uh-huh!
Here we go...
Don't try to procrastinate
(Putting off a choice you have to make)
You wait and you wait and react too late
(And you need a little help so you pass the plate)
Stop looking at me, I can't interfere
(You need to take a look at the man in the mirror)
Just step up, don't string me along
(When you sing me a song my sympathy's gone)
So, let it drop or get off the pot
(You can motor your mouth) Now walk the walk
(And make it clear) what you desire
(The bomb is ticking) choose a wire

Do (or do) or die (or die), the truth (the truth) or lies (or lies)
Get (Uh-huh) involved (or what?) or move (or move) aside (aside)
Stay (stay) or go (or go), raise (or raise) or fold (or fold)
Slip and fall (or fall) or gain (or gain) control
But right now

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
It's time for you to decide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)
Stand up, you know you can't hide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)
It's time for you to decide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)
Stand up, you know you can't hide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)

Einstein!
What you gonna do?
Make up your mind, don't waste time
Save all the drama..
..be for real!

[Andy Cooper] + (Dizzy Dustin)
Your decision please, (I'm counting to three)
May I take your order, (What'll it be?)
No room for your ambiguity
(Do you know what this is doing to me?)
You wanna sit on the sideline, trying to buy time
Man, grow a spine stop calling for lifelines
(Draggin this out to the point of exhaustion
Cause you're lost and you can't pick an option)
This whole act I'm not buying at all
(You're just trying to stall,) you'll only heighten the fall
(Cause you can't keep,) can't keep runnin' away
Is it coming today (or another delay?)

Give (give) or take (or take), a risk (a risk) or safe (or safe)
The per-fect (Uh-huh) choice (Or what?) or big (or big) mistake (mistake)
Mouse (Mouse) or man (or man), lie down (lie down) or stand (or stand)
Lower your voice (or what?) or shout (or shout) command
but right now

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
It's time for you to decide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)
Stand up, you know you can't hide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)
It's time for you to decide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)
Stand up, you know you can't hide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)

Einstein!
What you gonna do?
Make up your mind, don't waste time
Save all the drama..
..be for real!
Right, right now!

Do (do) or die (or die), the truth (the truth) or lies (or lies)
Get (What?) involved (Uh-huh!) or move (or move) aside (aside)
Stay (stay) or go (or go), raise (raise) or fold (or fold)
Slip (OHHHHH!!!) and fall (What?) or gain (or gain) control
But right now!

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
It's time for you to decide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)
Stand up, you know you can't hide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)
It's time for you to decide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)
Stand up, you know you can't hide
You've got to make up your mind (right now)

[Andy Cooper]
You gotta do it, man
You've got to make up your mind (Right now)
That's right, come on
You've got to make up your mind (Right now)
Stop stalling, you better do it
You've got to make up your mind (Right now)
Come on, right now
You've got to make up your mind (Right now)
Let's get outta here
Sick of that stuff, you gotta make up your mind
Stop talking, talking and talking
It's called action, man...

"Stand smiling before others, stand or stare before your self.
Calm and distress, cheerful in everyday life.
When they applaud you, stand indifferent, and when they hiss you, immovable."</pre>
