[Chorus 2X: Dungeon Masta]
Get that gwop, fam, get that dough

[Dungeon Masta]
You a star, don't care who you are
My flows will go far, can I get an ahh, ahh
I have pain to release, when will this shit cease
Dungeon Masta's a beast, caught between war and peace
I shall reign my plane, keeep what I kill, man
Fear not, the life from the Klingon
Is this microphone on? While your tat figures try to form Voltron
You be dead by dawn, then you''re here til morn'
For the life your torn, always calm, beef will storm
Don't let me stick my apple in your Jinny popcorn

[Chorus 8X]

[Dungeon Masta]
Ma, what's good, baby girl, I shall see you around
Ayayayayayaya, (your world)
Can I get a slice of that pie, it's much seasoned cuz I'm high
I'm so lethal, you can take me where you want to go
Remain the same, no, it's no game and your
Hard body better start dripping
Fall back, you don't feel, ma, what it be like
Run Power-U, after that empty your bank account, boo
So I can show you the right world you living in
We live out our dreams, no limitations
Tenth Chamber runs empires nation
Freedom is death, is what you facing
Always calm, beef or storm
Don't let me stick my apple in your Jinny popcorn

[Chorus 8X]

[Dungeon Masta]
Paying no attention to you, don't know what to do
Say you wanna live, that's period stew
The things I do to you, I just can't explain
Do you wanna know the real meaning of pain
It's so simple it's plain, all I have to do
Is what I do to maintain
But a change is a powerful thing
I do all day, I need extreme measures
Voices come and go, can you substitute the pleasure?
I think not, diamonds is the real reason for a D to rock
Where I go I set, shop
Heads often found here on the chopping block
This Chamber us, whether you like it or not
Always caught with beef or stew
Don't let me stick my apple in your Jinny popcorn

[Chorus 8X]</pre>
