[Chorus: Wadud Ahmad + Dice Raw] + (Dice Raw)
The streets talk, and they hear
And they watch, ao stay clear
Cause they need, the streets feed
A street thief, and what they need
(Everybody get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Everybody get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Everybody get up!)

[Black Thought]
Uh, I get up
Read the mornin' paper, kiss my baby girl
Tell my lady friend I'm gone 'till I save the world
Jump in my Hot Rod wheel, lookin' super thoroug
Rockin' a long black cape like the Duke of Earl
My cool don't drop, I spit where the future twirl
I smash glass in my hands to produce a pearl
I do the James on stage, then I do the ?
You can tell I'm bonafide live, cause I'm too fo' real
So the truth prevail, I never fail
Ask me to key the blaze in the trail
I never tell, like the digits on the check in the mail
I give 'em hell with the clever rhymes in the squad situated ?
White on white shelltoes throwin' elbows
You wanna holla, you can do the rebel yell bro
I'm not concerned, when will y'all learn
Roots crew mothafuckas, it's the grand return

[Chorus: Wadud Ahmad + Dice Raw] + (Dice Raw)
The streets talk, and they hear
And they watch, ao stay clear
Cause they need, the streets feed
A street thief, and what they need
(Everybody get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Everybody get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Everybody get up!)
