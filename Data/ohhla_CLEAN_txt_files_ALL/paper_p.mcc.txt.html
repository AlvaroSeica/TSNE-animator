[mc chris]
I spell word with a three, name's mc
Other rappers flow weak like window unit A.C.'s
Latinas on my penis, Japanese on they knees
I love all the ladies as long as they 18
I got bling up the ying, a plethora of Porsches
I'll say anything cause my mouth is remorseless
Even The Source says my hip-hop's a vortex
Leave horse heads on door steps, my mic checks cost Corvettes
The strobe light explodes white as I step on the floor
Thebar keep knows the code so he throws me a Stroh's
Weak emcees decompose, cause they know I can flow
Like Wessel comma Zam through Coruscant corridors
Humidor filled with stoges, filled with 'dro
Like 90210 it's filled with the word "bro"
Fuck the lexicon of octagons I'm all about go
These amateurs got catheters I'm all about prose by pros

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
All I wanna do is *Bang Bang Bang Bang*
And *Click* *Ka-Ching*, and take your money

[mc chris]
I'm lit like a Branch Davidian
I'm what's left of the lithium in Cobain's cranium
I fill Wembley Stadium
I'm once-bitten, twice-shy call it pyromania
When I roll up in Kashyyyk, I roll three Jedis deep
The fleet of peeps that I creep all got vests underneath
There's no need to beleive in the heat that I keep
The swears that I {*bleep*} or the heiresses I freak
It's embarrassing to me, I'm like kerosene it seems
Or D-R-E-W-B with incendiary schemes
Blowing up making cream, I am just like Howard Dean
When I scream I get red, I get mean
Can't believe you be buyin what I be shuckin and jivin
Fuck it if I am the next big thing with promotional tie-ins
I am just a cartoon-making rappe, you think that I'm lying
Everyone bust a move like it is a rave in Zion

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
M.I.A.
Third world democracy
Yeah, I've got more records than the KGB
So, uh, no funny business

[Outro 2X: mc chris]
Some some some I some I murder
Some I some I let go

[Chorus]</pre>
