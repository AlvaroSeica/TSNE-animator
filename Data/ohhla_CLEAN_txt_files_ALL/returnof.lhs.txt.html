[Virtuoso]
Novocaine in my veins and nerve gas in my heart
There ain't no shame in my game, I'm tearin rappers apart
Artistic nihilist, smash your skull with +The Iron Fist+
Lion with the witch and the wardrobe, lightin spliffs
A titan bitch, I'm monolithic
My spitting's redefinin modern physics and provin there's not a difference
between me and the God descripted in the holy Bible
Homey my moves are psycho like a retard on a motorcycle
It's Big Virt, Lord Lhus, and the Savage Brothers
This isn't rap for lovers, this some shit to slap your mother
Hit it from the back, no rubbers, raw doggin it
Your middle bro flow is my spittin image, I fathered it
Then I slaughtered it, I am monstrous, dominant
Kamikaze tactics smack you with a cactus, pava spit
Diamond tipped blades, fragmental grenades
Shrapnel pierce your vital organs, blood pourin on the stage
Big Virt

[Lord Lhus]
I never liked nothin, I never liked frontin
So I kept it real - end of discussion~!
Kill the competition, you'd better run for cover
Fuck a mean mug, send a slug to face fuck ya
We in the streets brother, hey I'm a landmine
And you don't wanna step, I see it in your eyes
Cause you scared now, yo I'm a real demon
I'm a monster, I'm a menace, I'm a fuckin heathen
We burn big blunts, under city lights
Fifth of whiskey sippin, on that get right
Think about life, and watch it fly past
That's why we cop nice, that's why we puff that
Stick icky we burn it chokin on kush packs
Ain't no holdin my team, you'd better get back
I let Qualm off the leash man, it's a wrap
Savage Brothers, what's fuckin with that? Nothin
Warm liquor, loaded guns that bust quicker
Born sinner roll up lye in a Swisher
No competition, number one contender
The champ is here, my clique, a bunch of gorillas
Wolves in sheep's clothin, and all of us holdin
Words unspoken, mouths open, game over
Souls is hopeless, give em a dose of dopeness
Never lose focus amongst the rats and roaches
The barrel smokin when the snake approaches
Hocus pocus find me here to smoke 'em in doja
Now hold this - some magical shit
It cause the planet to rip, burn mode and flip
Re-born again, now meet your maker
Cease the vapur, see you later
Each one teach one pay the piper player
Pick pocket politics slice your face up
Hip-hopologists toast to the caper
We some rockwilders burn piff in the paper
You can get it too, man fix your face up
Before the razor lace ya, imitator
Plastic faker, I'ma crack your shape up
Skeleton breaker, the lacerator
I stand on my own two, a skully fuck the shape up
Uhh, ski-mask get my cake up
She says she hate the game but loves the player
I'm on some next level shit take the elevator
If my phone's off, just call me later
Fuck a friend, and fuck a favor
Fuck you haters - uhh, yeah it's like that
Savage Brothers in the back with the ski-mask
What the fuck you want? We never front
Hip-Hop shit, all in your gut - WHAT~?!</pre>
