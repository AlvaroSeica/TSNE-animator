Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We request to negotiate
We come to you unarmed
We desire to communicate
You cannot do us harm

For one sacrifice
they have schemes and ask me to follow their path to the afterlife
I've got an appetite
for nice things and the dreams that my enemies could be blasted by
Ooh metaphors
Views that are better for you can't survive or find your competitor
Rise together
Ooh Fight separate wars i pray I'm never forced to be a predator

Suspecting
we won't last
They're glad to hate
When gladiators
Breathe their last
Scream en masse
When the dreams do clash
Like swords in the war
let me bleed on that
Put the heat on that
Say we need strong backs
call us weak
and don't redeem contracts
But the feast wont last
When this beast attacks
The sons and the fathers
will be free at last

This is love, and not treason
This is love, and not treason
This is love, and not treason
This is love, and not treason

They see sharks in the estuary
They claim the arch of Bartholomew's
They say war is necessary
But we say war is child abuse

We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag Warriors (You cannot do us harm)

Core-to-core
they're the one's we've been waiting for
We hold steady,
Steadier than stevedores
...doesn't matter of what came before
Forgive the debts
and settle scores
and test the mettle
Either ore

What's your plan go to do with me?
If the bell tolls, let freedom ring
And find the new ways that we must be king
Instead of leading the young to our suffering

We pass testaments down scream back at heaven
For testing us like Wednesday's at 11
Want to recruit and train us to act evilly
Save it for the shooting range
And smack DVDs

So study war no more this millennium
It's never again for me or anyone
So think harder when you refer to us
Rather make our children martyrs than murders

This is love, and not treason
This is love, and not treason
This is love, and not treason
This is love, and not treason

They shell dwellings to quell the shellings
And lift taboos to seduce the cowards
They say we're too yellow bellied
But we say we're the new superpower

We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag Warriors (You cannot do us harm)

We seek ways to not be liable
We claim to speak for a higher truth
We stand opposed to the homicidal
We tell you you are fire proof

We'd rather make our children (We request to negotiate)
Martyrs than murderers (We come to you unarmed)
We'd rather make our children (We desire to communicate)
White Flag
Warriors
We'd rather make our children
We'd rather make our children

Do what you want to our courage
Ask us what you will
Demand from us a sacrifice
But do not make us kill</pre>
