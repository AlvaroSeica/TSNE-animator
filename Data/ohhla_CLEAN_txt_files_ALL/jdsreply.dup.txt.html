[J.D.]
Gimme dat beat fool, it's a full time jack move
Fuck y'all I'll make the motherfuckin track move
And Eminem, Tim, Tom, Dick, and Hank
Already know that I'm something ya'll ain't
A little young non-stopper
And from Rap to R&amp;B I'm breaking niggas off proper
With that S-O S-O DEF M-O-B; fuck Dre, this J.D.
And here's how I'm a greet ya
Stop (Record Scratches) fool - come off that beat (Beat Changes)

Ya should've never fucked with College Park
You little gay ass mark
All you can say about me is that I'm short 
But my dough is long
Dr. Dre motherfucker come on
See I know you don't do half the work in the studio
Plus you like letting niggas play with your booty hole
Whoa!!! Off in Dre dick he choked 
Timbaland's in the house "What up loc"?
Niggas don't even think about it (uh uh)
Are better yet motherfucker you need to think about it
You same beat makin non-rappin individ-ual
I was makin what you make now when I was a child (ha)
You still try to come up, look at you and look at me
Nigga don't try to run up
Cause you'll get bang something sweet
J-D-U-P-R-I and I'm jacking y'all beats (Beat Changes)

Di Di Da Di Di Di Di Da Di Day (Ha)
Who gives a fuck about a Timbaland and Dre?
A-T-L-A-N-T-A is where I'm from
And I'm a keep on dropping these bombs, see
I think that we too big to be battleing
But I'm sick and tired of hearing you motherfuckers keep babblen
Ya so stick this in your ass for a minute

(Talking) (Beat Changes)
And if you come at me again
I'm a come right back at your ass three times harder
Fo sho, I do this nigga, fuck y'all
Oh yeah, Eminem, I left you out deliberately - you know why?
Cause to me you like a character in Disney World
Known for dissing pop groups and Justin's Ex-Girl
Shit don't nobody take you serious (Laughing)
Naw, you dont get no credit fo that
Nigga, you dont get no credit fo that
Motherfucker </pre>
