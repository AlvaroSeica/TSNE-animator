[King Just]
Crank call all of ya'll, give me the jack
When I disconnect the line, don't ever call back
I'm like AT&amp;T, I reach out and touch one
Don't front, you get punched in your MCI, son
From the Bell Atlantic, until I'm Verizon
In the phonebook, for, rhyme socializing
Speak when you're spoken to, cuz Nextel's
When jiggy come, trust me, dog, he Sprint well
The long drive, Nokia, unless a Voicestream like Maria
I mean caller ID her
Private line, bitch style, star 82
Z-Line, cuz I ain't try'nna talk to you
Call waiting if you, skins or butt
And if you wanna speak to Tone, the God'll hang up
Accept collect calls if you in the penile
I be screaming in your ear like 'can you hear me now?'

[Chorus: King Just]
Mr. telephone man, there's something wrong with my line
Don't make me grab my nine
KJ, all day, I stay in my prime
Shine, player shine, shine, shine

[King Just]
Flash back, take back, all the way to 8-track
Rock and roll disco, heavy metal raps
Stay strapped cuz you get clapped with the applause
There's sharks in the water, I'm the 3D Jaws
KJ, hear me roar, son shine evangelist
I heard it all before
Look whose hurting now off my freestyle
I'mma big dog, not a little 'bow wow'
Poodle, you ain't got nothing on Who You
Smack down your rap judo with rap voodoo
Doo-doo, that mean I'm the shit
Think you wanna leave the one you with and start a new relationship
He Usher, I'm Asher
Related to blackwood, and Dutch Master
Pass the, light, and give me the 'dro
I guess these niggas don't know, yo

[Chorus]

[King Just]
Mr. Choke stay smoking, always keep the crowd open
Want a toking, here's a token, show off, ferryboating
Be potent, stay open, ain't, too many going
With the diggy-diggy-doping, Loose Link, nigga loc'ing
Super nigga, super soak 'em, why you think I am the chosen?
KJ for president, that's the hood star voting
Think bitches start an open pose, like ya ass is voting
I pack the winner belt, like a fucking Hulk Hogan
The dub still going with pockets that's floating
Cuz I clean out more shit than Colin Powell
Pop Moltrin, ever vowel, A-E-I-O-U
Two, yo, throw in the towel
I'll devour, I'm a rainstorm
You a sunshower, man, ain't No Power
On Earth, that can stop my rebirth
A backwards, nigga, born feet first
Niggas need work, before the heat jerks
I had you fucking ducking down, eating dirt
Cook out, before I get beamed the hell up
Got 'em by a landslide, fry, still try'nna catch up

[Chorus]</pre>
