[Nina Simone]
Only the lonely love, only the sad of soul
Wake and begin their day in the middle of the night
To breakfast on their pride, burnt joys and tears just dried
To breakfast with the moon in the middle of the night

Then to count once more my miserly hoard
of your kisses in this darkness restored
To grasp your absent grace, in desperate embrace
To make your false heart true, middle of the night, the night...</pre>
