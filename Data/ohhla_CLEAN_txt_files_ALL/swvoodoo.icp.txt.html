Southwest Voodoo

Voodoo, runnin' from my magic

Brain insane, ??????
Southwest voodoo's in the haugh!
Wicked voodoo, dope dark killer
Magic, dark magic

[Violent J]
Met this kid named Louie Lou 
He thought he could fuck with this voodoo
So I turned his head into a lima bean
And then flicked it off his shoulders 

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
From Mookan House to Shangra La 
Egyptian Pharaoh, coompata 
Follow me, and join us as we pray 
To the seventeen moons of Coonga Del Ray 

[Violent J]
Walked in the lunchroom chantin' spells 
With bamboo bitches and voodoo bells 
Got my own food, who wants some? 
I got possum nipples and raccoon tongue 

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
A non-believer once started to laugh 
So I launched a fireball up his punk-ass 
Then everybody heard him squeal 
"This voodoo shit's for real!" 
It just takes...

[Chorus (1x)]
A handful of neden, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo

(2x)
Brain insane, ?????????
Southwest voodoo's in the haugh!
Wicked voodoo, dope dark killer
Magic, dark magic

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Crypt on Verner on a windy night
You see voodoo scribblings in the moonlight 
Painted all on the city street 
It's the ancient craft of gang bangin 
Hey! J! What's in the bag? 

[Violent J]
A shrunken head, and shriveled scrotum sac 
Why? Ya think voodoo's fake? 
Come to the graveyard, I'll make the dead wake 

"Raise, raise, shooga-boom ba. 
Sleep no longer, raise, quick 
Raise, raise, shooga-boom ba, 
Leave us alone, you fuckin' punk bitch!"


Well, fuck it, I ain't that good yet 
But one day you can bet I'm a freak
We'll make the whole world dance with the dead
And just like my homey said
It only takes... 

[Chorus (1x)]

Voodoo running from my magic (3x)
I'll make a voodoo doll out of ya and flick your nuts

[Chorus (1x)]
