[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
And what we have here...
Somethin GREAT!
Trey! Woo!

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl I want you to know
I can't get you out of my head, my head, my head
Girl I want you to know-ow!
I don't even know what you did, you did, you did
But I love it

[Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, uh, everything hooks
Everything works, you're a real good chorus
I'm a real good verse, freestyle unrehearsed
So clean, no curse
And when the song's done man everything hurts so I put it in reverse
Go back to the scene where I seen you first
Yeah, I need you to sing that single again
Play that video I seen you up in
A hundred million spins in my mind all day
Callin in requests, on the line always
Yeah, the president of your fan club
Leave them players all behind like the band, love

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Lupe Fiasco]
Wait, playa need a minute
Like in time I'd intend this 'fore I finish - how'd I get in this?
Maybe was your hair, maybe was your flair
Maybe it's the heels and the way you wear
Maybe it's you're real and the way you care
You don't care if I'm ill or a millionaire
The only thing that matter is that the feelin's there
Your smile's so bright, it's like a grill's in there
High off life, don't need a pill in there
You're killin me, I think I need a will in here
Got me feelin real skill's impaired
Hard to describe why you're still in here

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Trey Songz] + (Lupe Fiasco)
Don't care what nobody say
Cause I like it girl
(Might go crazy tryin to figure this out, love)
But I like it girl
Don't even know why I feel this way
But I like it girl
(Caught up in somethin that I can't get out of)
But we like it girl!

[Chorus] - 2X w/ ad libs

[Lupe] Lupe!
[Trey] I can't get you out of my head
[Lupe] Trey
[Trey] My head - ohhhh</pre>
