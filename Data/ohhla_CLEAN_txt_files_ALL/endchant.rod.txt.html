The world is changed, I feel it in the water
I feel it in the earth, I smell it in the air
Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future

[Cno Evil]
I can smell it in the air, that something is not right
Too much pain and suffering in the middle of the night
The fights, don't even have any more meaning
They overcome by the shadows of the misleading
I breathe in, I breathe out, I'm not a lemming
I don't follow them off the ledge, and straight to heaven
Too much brainwashing, like they boxed in a box
With no freedom of speech, just told what you should shop for
I'm like an outlaw, running out the back door
Handcuffs on my hands, feet dragging on the floor
A slave of hip hop, I refused to get copped
Bought out by industry propaganda flipflops
If my shit flops, atleast I have a pure heart
I'm not a robot that gets rebuilt with your better parts
The real state of hip hop is gone, almost finished
But we can change the course of the future, just witness
The hearts of men, are easily corrupted
No more music, just noise, with your clutter and rumblings
That's why we in a state of emergency
So we retaliate, with the quickest ways of urgency
Come splurge with me, come rejoice with the voice
The tears of joy, making your bittersweet moist
Make the other cheek choice, and look 'em in the eye
Turn your back, and do your raps, make 'em wonder why
The 6 Feet Under guys, there's a reason we took that name
Underground's the sound, let's unite and do the same
Let's take flight into the flames, and dwell into the hells
Might result in war, let's start ringing them bells
I never hold back, cuz this is what I love
My heart stays underground, I keep my brain above
I've been escaped the traps, even clogged up my ears
Let 'em go, no more fears, I hear what I wanna hear

[Chorus: Cno Evil]
Don't hold back, if this is what you love
Don't go back, and keep ya self above
Don't get trapped, by the music that you hear
Let yourself go, and overcome your fears

[Li-Mouse]
Even the smallest person can change the course of the world
Think about it, one idea, one man, even a girl
Invent, and create things that we take for granted
What if there was never a wheel, would you feel so enchanted?
Natural resources, they would never get shipped
So you can scratch off, rolling up, in that brand new whip
And nope, that Pepsi you got, no straw to take that sip
You can clutch destiny, you'll never lose grip
Imagine, not one machine or computer was born
The world itself would be twisted up and torn
The ability to make and create a new idea
But can backfire, with guns and bombs from North Korea
Changing the course of the future is difficult, hard to trace it
When the new gets old, someone has to replace it
Much like what The Rodentz are here to do to hip hop
Never claim to be hood, street, or ever get popped
I'm tired of you saying we're soft, cuz we care not
Willingly admit paintballs the one time I've been shot
Only killing I do is, frags in my CPU
Listen to my words and you might see me through
How can someone as small as me, make such a big change
Given this name in this insane domain, I play this game
It's critical, hip hop needs individuals
That ignore the lies, disses propaganda risiduals
I sleep to Cold 97 and Weak 105
Very little do they give new talent to strive
A different story though, get back to the topic
Lyrical pilots, who control throttles in the cockpit
I refuse to give up, I'm giving everything I have
I can tell by the flows, MC's only couldn't have
And that's that, the story of the future
Something that can never been seen, by no computer

One chance, to destroy evil, forever
One chance, to destroy evil, forever
One chance, to destroy evil, forever
The hearts of men, are easily corrupted
One chance, to destroy evil, forever
One chance, to destroy evil, forever
One chance, to destroy evil, forever
The hearts of men, are easily corrupted</pre>
