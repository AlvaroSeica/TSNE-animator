[Mos Def]
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Pummel on the motherboard, yes!
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes, the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out... (*Echoes*)

[Chorus: 2-D]
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the--
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the--
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the--
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the--

[2-D]
Oh stylo
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies..
up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies..
are not so broken hearted..

[Bobby Womack]
If it's love is electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night..just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard...right now

[2-D]
Sing yourself out of depression, rise above
Always searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love..

[Bobby Womack] [Chorus repeats]
There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passing through man and woman
In another world, in another world, in the universe
Right now, here's what we got to do

[Chorus repeats while Bobby Womack continues singing]

If its love is electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night..just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard...
That's what I'm talking about

[Mos Def]
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Pummel on the motherboard, yes!
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep this on
Yes the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out...(*Echoes)
