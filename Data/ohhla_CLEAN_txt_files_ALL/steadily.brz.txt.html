[ VERSE 1: Breeze ]
There's a difference between me and you and I can prove this
Check the stance, the dance and the smoothness
The fluidness, the effortless, I guess it's just
I flow a lot better from the first to the last letter
How do you think you compare to me, brother?
I double and triple em all compared to your six-dollar stutter
I'm flowin like champagne, you're still sayin the same thing
Tryin to maintain, that's a damn shame
Try to play me out, nah, I'm not havin it
Rhymes are like a victim, it's murder when I kick em
You can't understand why your plan don't seem to go right
You're claimin that you're so hype
But steadily tryin to flow like...

A record, a method, I'm showin one's intelligence
It's quite evident, dependin on who's tellin it
Kick some logic, yo, that's the object
Avoid a weak topic, before you start it, stop it
Beats I walk over, tracks I talk over
You had your turn to burn, I just fought over
This ain't a joke, a gag and not a riddle, fag
Singers are greedy and seedy just like a nickel bag
Don't try to run up because you'll get done up
You try to come up, you lost, now I'm one up
When I throw rhymes just for the sake of old time
Your rap don't weigh a carat and mine weigh a goldmine
Fluid, the way a poet speaks to you
Not only teach to you, but must reach a few
You can't understand why your plan don't seem to go right
You're claimin that you're so hype
But steadily tryin to flow like...

A lyricist is hearin this, and then he wonders if
He wants to get some of this, I didn't come to diss
Tryin to play me but I'm not lettin
Talkin smack behind my back, what's the matter, feel threatened?
Reactions are spontaneous, confused between dangerous
And deadly, but you're steadily tryin to anger this
Forget comparin me to you or sayin what you would do
If you got whiff, tryin to riff, how dare you
Separate me from the beat when I'm creatin
Puttin yourself on hold because you're waitin
To see what I make so you can take and duplicate
Is breakin your ear, now take a year to recouperate
Hold a edge on competitors cause I can outsmart them
I know it hurts to hear it but if the shoe fits, wear em
You can't understand why your plan don't seem to go right
You're claimin that you're so hype
But steadily tryin to flow like...
