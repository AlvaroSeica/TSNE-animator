Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook: Trae &amp; (Dougie D) - 2x]
We grind full time (now what it do)
All day and all night (now what it do)
(Because we, cock glocks and make a nigga slide out)
(And then we ride out, niggas be on a hide out)

[Trae]
24/7 I be on the grind, all around the clock
And I won't crap out, cause I gotta get paid
The life that I live, gon keep me real
The fold that I got, gon keep me dibs
I'm a street nigga, that'll tell you
You don't wanna try me nigga
Running up on me, nigga you fin to feel
The heat, that's coming up out of my triggas
Quick to click, like I'm a time bomb
Fucking up your eyesight, with a red light
Light enough to light, fin to make
These niggas, get the shit right
I'm a Guerilla Maab soldier, already told you
Hopping out, we gon get crunk
Pop the trunk, and somebody get dumped
You hating us, it ain't never no fading us
And when these niggas testing us
Then my glock is next to us
And I ain't gon give up, till I hit the top
Trae, Dougie D just ain't gon stop
Till I got the rap game, all chromed out
Running around, with a big fat knot
Of cash flow, the fast do is all I know
Living in this game, saying thugged out
And untamed, while trying to set my time frame
Before my time, will get to running out
Straight up I just can't quit, trying to get rich
On the grind, full time
Cause we the ones deserving this

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
Constantly grinding, with my mind up on my feddy
Working my jelly, communicate on cellular tellies
Niggas ain't ready, for the shots we proceed to blast
Constantly struggling striving, on a mission for cash
Cause we live the life, steady pursuing our cheddar
Everything gotta get better, when I put it together
Dougie, Rock and Trae, kicking down doors to make our way
Niggas be peeping our flow, like whoo I'm on the way
Now tell me what it do, chunking on up look if y'all hear me
You can run but you can't hide, from this lyrical incision
From your ear to ear, fill you with roughness and the rawest
Everytime that we touch you, Trae be spitting sickness flawless
And if it's about paper, better believe we grabbing that
And if it's about plex, better believe we blasting that
Niggas you smelling that, 3D-2 fucking up platinum placks
Drama we ain't having that, when we see money we after that

[Hook - 2x]

[Raw-D]
I'm down to ride, for the god damn green
These hoe ass niggas, can't fuck with me
I'm out here, hustling up in these streets
Pack my glock, and roll with heat
Trying to make this meat, cause my belly rumbling
I don't have nothing to eat
On the fulltime grind my nigga, so I'm barely getting to sleep
So I can't slow down my mission, till my quest is complete
Swift and unique, I'm still gon be that same ol' G
Ounces of cheese and weed, but I'm fiending for that green
While y'all capping and trying to bling
I be bleeding, trying to get my green
Fulfilling my dream, one deep never had a shoulder to lean on
Can't postpone, see your boo and get motherfuckers better get on
Or get spit on, making bitches hitting up on my cell phone
Thinking that I'ma fall off, then you hating bitches are dead wrong
Raw-D is who I be, a young ol' G from the 4
Fin to let you know if you's a hoe, knocking knocking now here it go
Might explode like C4, on your back like some dominoes
My nigga that's how it go, for the love of my payro'
