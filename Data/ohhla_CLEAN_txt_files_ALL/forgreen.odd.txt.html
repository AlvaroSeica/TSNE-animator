[Intro]
Uhh~! Huh, yeah, uh
Mike G uh, Left Brain yo
Odd Future Wolf Gang, look
Uhh, yeah

[Mike G]
Follow the leader, bad senoritas in two seaters
She love green, that's money, Mary Jane, and margaritas
The way it seems, the streets be lookin at me like a teacher
They houndin me, like desperate rappers waitin for a feature
I ain't sayin I don't need you, I'm sayin let's keep the pace
Should be back at your place, just bein patient with'cha feet up
They say he's so chill, how does he show no stress?
He can't see into the future, how he know what's next?
Seein all of these steps that he's takin
You're mistaken if they say we ain't so complex
I'm tryin to be in the blue coupe, you can't pronounce the name
with a bad yellow bitch and she's singin "Purple Rain" so insane

[Chorus]
And people talkin down on me, I don't really think they should
They said they could do it better, I don't really think they could
I ain't wolfin niggaz wishes, but I wish a nigga would
This ain't as easy as it looks, I just make it look good
Yeah they talkin down on me, I don't really think they should
They said they could do it better, I don't really think they could
I ain't wolfin niggaz wishes, but I wish a nigga would
This ain't as easy as it looks, I just make it look good

[Mike G]
If it's politics we the Presidents, so presence serves a purpose
It's obvious that we evidence you payin for a service
And I feel, you always think you less than what you can be
What does it mean if I think I'm the one these niggaz can't see?
Gang mentality, Odd Future is a family
My niggaz thrash, I was always anti-plan B
Did I lose you? I know I'm much more than yoy used to
Now I got these girls steppin out from they usual
So they tune in, T.I., see I, realize I'm a stand up guy
And these niggaz realize they can't stand to see me on TV
So they lose their footin like they was gluttons with diabetes
But fuck the bullshit, I'm just tryin to get rich
with my middle fingers up screamin "Swag me out bitch~!"
Black kid on the corner sellin drugs, go figure
Salute them with 21 guns, I'm killin these niggaz
Heh, haha, uhh... bitch!
Oh, and Free Earl motherfucker...
{*long instrumental pause*}
