[Intro]
Brothers and Sisters
Let me share with you some news 
As I sit on my plush couch watching the news
There has been a rude awakening
That I have marched until my feet have bled; 
And have rioted until they called the Feds
What's left my conscience said? 
What's left my conscience said? GO!

[Speech]
As I look out my window I can see the little ones
Playing amongst each other with the water guns 
In pure poverty 
Generations of good people in cycles of poverty 
It bothers me so I ask myself (I say)
Are you doing as much as you can for the struggle? (No)
Am I doing as much as I can for the struggle? (No)
Then why do I cry when my people are in trouble? (Yo!)
My ancestors slapped me in the face and said "GO!"
Harriet Tubman told me to get on up!
Marcus Garvey said to me, bro, you get on up! 
My brother malcolm X, need I say more 
It ain't like we've never seen blood before,  
Come on, let's talk Revolution, now!

[Chorus]
(Oh, my people say, oh my brothers say, oh my sisters say, HEY! Oh, my people 
say/ come on let's talk about a Re-volution)

[Speech]
I seen blood on one Malcolm as one shot him
I see tears, because now it seems we've forgot him 
I've seen years of people struggling for a solution
Like restitution; excuses, no more no more confusion
Come on, come on, let's talk right
Talk up talk up, but don't talk up up all night
There's got to be action if you want satisfaction
If not for yourself, for the young ones (the children!)
The US, the UN, we can't allow ya
to tellustthe kidinthegetto isnotasimportantasthiskidin Bosnia [sic]
I ain't with it; just forget it
We can't even debate if you don't understand our situation
You don't want us to go get a gun now
You don't like to see people runnin' around now, do ya?
Yet and still you want to live like '90210', while we scream out "Yo FREEDOM"!
My grandmother has a goal we have wasted
You best acquire a taste for somethin' you never tasted
So people, let us wear our pallets
it's either the bullet or the ballot; come now

[Chorus]
Revolution now, (repeat chorus)

[Outro]
Now see, I understand what my people have said
They tell me to FIGHT fight for the answers to our dead
For Harriet Tubman, MOVE organization, David Walker, the Black Panthers 
Kwame and Kuma, Marcus Garvey, Jane Pitman
Revolution!</pre>
