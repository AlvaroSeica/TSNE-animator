[Intro: Papoose] (DJ Premier)
Aiyyo Premier what's up man? (What's up Pap?)
Live from The Nacirema Dream, Papoose and DJ Premier *Yeah!)
Time to turn it up on these niggas man
Aiyyo Primo you ready to turn it up (You know it)
Let's turn it up on 'em

[Chorus: Papoose]
We never heard of your clique but they heard of us
They put 'em down we liftin them burners up
You keep sayin word to your mother but word to what?!
I don't give a fuck about none of these niggas 
I turn it up, come on come on killers 
Here go my cup gimme some more liquor
Open this back window let me dump on niggas
It's my era, I'm 'bout to turn in up on niggas

[Verse One: Papoose]
Peace to the New York Knickerbockers the plot got thicker
'Cause now they got the Brooklyn Nets and Barclay Center
Hello misses and mister, cousins, brothers and sisters
Ladies and gentlemen children, prisons and finger printers
Snakes who like to slither, wolves, monkeys, gorillas
Veterans and beginners, righteous people and sinners
Gamblers, losers and winners, ice grillers and grinners
Hope y'all all some good swimmers 'cause I'm as deep as the river
I'm the bad guy just like The Joker and Riddler
Bad as Mike in his prime +Man In The Mirror+ and +Thriller+
You ain't even a real man, you can't even use the shitter
You a pussycat you probably got kitty litter
I'm a kill rich niggas in chinchilla
Representin for the wig splitters and skid bidders who gets realer
Like Beenie Man carjack a bitch nigga
Who got the keys to the jeep? sim simma

[Chorus: Papoose]
We never heard of your clique but they heard of us
They put 'em down we liftin them burners up
You keep sayin word to your mother but word to what?!
I don't give a fuck about none of these niggas 
I turn it up, come on come on killers 
Here go my cup gimme some more liquor
Open this back window let me dump on niggas
It's my era, I'm 'bout to turn in up on niggas

[Verse Two: Papoose]
With my oral deliver it's such a moral dilemma 
I don't quarrel with quitters I give 'em sorrow and shimmers
You think your artist is iller just 'cause his car from the dealer
This music genre is bitter 'cause y'all some horrible spitters
When I swallow the liquor I write a marvelous scripture
Start drawing a picture 'cause I'm immortal my nigga
Beef is played out, so I don't bother with niggas
But as long as it's tender I eat your squad up for dinner
Put my palms on the trigger and shoot you all in your liver
Injure all of you niggas I'm cool calm as a killer
Your man starvin for figures, man who are you Vanilla?
Ice, I'm Suge Knight hang 'em off the balcony with ya
Since I deserve scrilla I learned to flip birds quicker
Had to hit curves with the hustlers and emerge richer
Back when Dipset, was sippin sizzurp nigga
My jewelry was black and yellow just like the Pittsburgh Steelers

[Chorus: Papoose]
We never heard of your clique but they heard of us
They put 'em down we liftin them burners up
You keep sayin word to your mother but word to what?!
I don't give a fuck about none of these niggas 
I turn it up, come on come on killers 
Here go my cup gimme some more liquor
Open this back window let me dump on niggas
It's my era, I'm 'bout to turn in up on niggas

[Verse Three: Papoose]
I'm on the Money Train makin Dead President stops
Robbed the liquor store just so we can get some Ciroc
Ate Corn Flakes no Fruity Pebbles and Pops
Got chased by the stray dogs when I fled through the lot
Bought a 50 cent razor now I'm ready to rock
I'll step to your block with a George Jefferson bop
I cut him for his peddle bike, he bled to his socks
'Cause Miles didn't have a chain when I peddled it popped
My leather bomber was better than that pleather you rocked
I wore a Obama way before Michelle and Barack
I heard up north you wasn't reppin alot
You never caught a ten or three you respected the cops
How you 'gon use that jail shit to try to get to the top?
You woke up in PC never slept in the box
He said he hungry so I fed him the ox
My gun is like an independent record label Heckle and Koch 

[Chorus: Papoose]
We never heard of your clique but they heard of us
They put 'em down we liftin them burners up
You keep sayin word to your mother but word to what?!
I don't give a fuck about none of these niggas 
I turn it up, come on come on killers 
Here go my cup gimme some more liquor
Open this back window let me dump on niggas
It's my era, I'm 'bout to turn in up on niggas
