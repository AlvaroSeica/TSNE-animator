[Intro: Cee-Lo Green]
Hit the jets and watch us blast off
There's somethin going on beneath the water
People gettin hot and makin sons and daughters
It's just you and me, and L-U-V
in the T-U-B (Hot Tub of Love)

[Cee-Lo Green]
Bubbles in the tub, bubbles in the glass
Fig in your mouth, and my finger in your ass
Makin love tonight; makin intercontinental love tonight
(Are we above Egypt?) {That's Mt. Rushmore}
Givin you a hickie over the mighty Mississippi
Suckin on your toe, over downtown Tokyo
We're doin this dance over Paris, France
{Chuck Berry, me over Germany}
We're goin all the way, cause it's not a race
We can take it slow, into outer spaaaaaace
It's just you and me (Hot Tub of Love)

"Three, two, one - liftoff!"

[Cee-Lo Green]
We can take our time, don't have to wait in line
This hot tub's in the V.I.P. tonight
Give me the address to the ocean
I'm a'out to write it a letter
You may be the ocean
But I'm hotter and wetter
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey...

We're goin all the way, cause it's not a race
We can take it slow, into outer spaaaaaace
It's just you and me (Hot Tub of Love)</pre>
