[Intro]
A-B-C {*4X*}
1-2-3 (A-B-C, A-B-C) {*2X*}
1-2-3 ("robotics") 1-2-3 ("::") {*2X*}
1-2-3 ("robotics") 1-2-3...

[Verse One]
Simple as that for your simple ass
Ask about that pretty simple math
I'm dreamin on G.O.O.D. for a sicker plan
Sicker than any other nigga could be thinkin man
I can't be a loser coulda figured that
I can't be a lame I'm cooler than that
I feel I love the fame, then I hate it back
Thinking, now what I should be twitterin?
Why'd big bro take all the hot bitches?
Dear God me too, I like the hot bitches
I'll be the underdog all along 'til I'm gone
I will live through this song, I'll be strong through the haters

[Chorus]
As simple as that {*2X*}
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that {*2X*}
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that {*2X*}
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that {*2X*}
As simple as (1-2-3)

[Verse Two]
Uhh! Simple as that for your simple ass
Timple way I wish you woulda called it how it shoulda been
They try to tell me they don't get it, they don't know the deal
Now I'll be damned I came this far to let a fool live
I gotta terminate the hate, spread the positive
But how to be not whack and cheesy to the little kids
So I curse like a sailor and I smoke weed
I am exactly who what all the rappers' kids be
And who they love, hands to the universe
Probably into the drug addicts if they spit a Cudi verse
Mad little mama sits her down, verse all out her purse
Long as the booty lookin juicy and he's stylin on 'em

[Chorus]

[Common]
As our hero seems to be dreamin in peace
A dark chapter unfolds throwing Scott into the most eerie
and unstable part of his imagination
So intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality
This, is the rise of the night terrors...</pre>
