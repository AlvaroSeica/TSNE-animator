Homeboy Sandman:

My kids is on drugs
Half they took at home, half the school gave 'em
They's told that school would save 'em
Nuh-uh
School enslave 'em
My principal wasn't stressin' education
That bitch was more concerned with decorations
Talking 'bout I need more posters
Any minute cops could rush in itching to pull they toasters out they holsters
How am I supposed to teach a class?
When just a period earlier students
caught a nasty temper from some tenured piece of trash
It take me 20 minutes just to get 'em back to feeling like human beings
To where the ones that can't even read at least'll humor me
I try to give em extra time
These kids already on they second strike
Frustrated by the second try
Brown v. Board done had a a ruling but what's the rule?
2005, I's teaching in a segregated school
An overpopulated, overmedicated, designated devastated
It's cruel

CHORUS
(kick the truth to the young Black youth)
(young gun, high strung)
(You need schoolin')
(Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there)
2x

The natives are restless
Displayin aggression
And that's the young ones
The old ones aren't staying for testing
So I gave em a question yo why you here
most of these kids just passin time until the day that they can buy a beer
priceless-- MasterCard ask the gods
the streets pay twice as much and the work gotta be like half as hard
I ask em all...you ever seen jersey shore?
I watch one hand then 2 hands then 30 more
Name of the game is education reform
Times is tougher than ever its quite a day to be born
I'm tryna overstand, how we get more
when prisons are built based on our kids 3rd grade test scores
Parents carefree, teachers stress more
You got kids wit lock picks stealin out ya desk drawer
student government
my president took computer cleaner to the restroom and then he started huffin it....*Ritalin etcetera the plethora
of meds the serve up would ace roger federer
Talk about desperate These kids known to pack weapons
and thats their idea of alternative assessments..

CHORUS

Teachers conference, 4 days up at the Hyatt
I can't remember enough of what I learned to apply it
Then i would Return to class, just to find that
in my absence my students incited a full riot
Got kinda violent, 2 subs retired
I must be gettin punished for every stupid thing I did
5 kids pullin straight F's
---And I ain't hear from the parents till the day we taught em safe sex..

Homeboy Sandman

Real teachers break necks
Surrounded by lowlifes teaching for paychecks
Funding is determined by the property tax
So if you got little you get little and you probably black
And since you black you better not even think of losing your head
These teacher's scared of you
first chance they get they'll put ya in special ed
Know this the faculty but I'm sympathizing with the students
On account of sympathizing with the movement
(Random) I'd say we need improvement</pre>
