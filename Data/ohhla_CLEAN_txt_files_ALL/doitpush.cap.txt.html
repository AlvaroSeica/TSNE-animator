[Intro: Cappadonna]
Six years in the game, nigga, I ain't changed a bit
Get with is, get up, yeah, come on
Do it, club drinkin' tonight, push, yeah

[Cappadonna]
My whole quick off the hook, catch us live at a theater
Chicks start doin' they thing, you gotta hear us
We always in effect, man, police don't scare us
We smoke weed in the clubs, drinkin' a little beer-a
Post up love, honeys in the mirror
Turn the mics up so they can hear a little clearer
Real niggaz and fly honies is in the area
Vibe with me, come on, stride with me
And when you start feelin' this shit, just slide with me
Lay back on this, come on, glide with me

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
Do it, push..
Do it, do it, do it

[Cappadonna]
Aiyo, whose the illest rappers, I don't really give a shit
All I wanna hear is one of ya'll niggaz spit
We at the livest event, and to get in this bitch
Some niggaz pay 20 cent, man, make it happen
Come on, all of ya'll niggaz on the left start clappin'
All of ya'll honey's on the right start clappin'
All in together now, get ready for the rappin' (come on, do it..)
Me and my click came over for some action
Sippin' on Hen dog, everybody maxin'
Next thing you know, these niggaz start yappin'
Heads was gettin' flown, jaws started crackin'
But then shit calm down, everything was chill
Stupid muthafuckas wanna test our skill
Ok, back to the beat, now, how it feel?

[Chorus]

[Cappadonna]
Ladies love how it's goin' down
Cuz we always show 'em love, everytime that we come around
And niggaz like how we doin' shit
It's just a couple muthafuckas wanna ruin the shit
You little thugs can't wait for the tunes to hit
Niggaz is wildin' out, racoons'll spit
We at the spot where the willies at, spendin' their chips
And them ghetto glamorous chicks be swingin' they hips
Niggaz best to believe, we like it just like that
All love in the fiesta, no kinds of crack
Everybody is fancy, see the jewels is fat
Come on ya'll, fuck with this, nigga, where you at?

[Chorus to end]</pre>
