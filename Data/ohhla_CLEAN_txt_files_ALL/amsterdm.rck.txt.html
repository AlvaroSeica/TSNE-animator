[Intro]
Greenback shit, cameras in the ceiling
Celine on my arm, we get ghost
You already know what it is
Money stuffed in my bag haha - Maybach shit!

[Rick Ross]
Bright lights and dark corners as night embark on us
+ReFugees+ running wild, +Wyclef+ with a Sig Sauer
Nothin to lose, I was starvin from the start
(ME~!) Now the same cat driving Jaguars
Open fire when you see me yell out and make [em whisper
The club that I'm a member they'll be +Gone by November+
Keys to the city got killers who slither with me
Lamborghini middle of the ghetto, smoke a fat fifty
Billionaire bid, wrists on chill
Standin in the field of dreams tryin to see a hundred mill'
These boys goin blind, they just happy being free
In a world of so many I just wanted me a ki'
Sheesh! I just wanted me a piece
Slice of cheesecake befo' my niggaz all decease
These boys snort lines, I'm fine just sippin wine
Amsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind

[Chorus]
I'm Barry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo to that boy that bend a piece
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Raw blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm livin through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

[Rick Ross]
Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick
Always runnin late, quick to show up wit'cha bitch
The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish
All stainless steel, quick to match it with my tool and
Red carpet event, the marijuana be lit
Red or blue, do you, as long as you're gettin rich
Crack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange
Rolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change
These niggaz actin like they want a war
When it come to whackin niggaz I done won awards
Nigga you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?
I'm ridin in some shit only I can afford
Shouldn't claim the hood 'til you build a rapport
Amsterdam state of mind I just gave you a tour
I'm laughing at the people who labelled me poor
Now I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn

[Chorus]

[Outro: Rick Ross]
I'm speakin on the unwritten laws - code of the streets
I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into
at a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him
and do what the fuck you want to do
Niggaz like me you gotta get permission homey
And that could take a long time
In that TIME, I'ma handle my motherfuckin business..
UGH, UGH
It's the red light district, nigga this Amsterdam
Wherever the fuck I'm at, it's a no go
We greenlight you bitch niggaz
Rozay~!! </pre>
