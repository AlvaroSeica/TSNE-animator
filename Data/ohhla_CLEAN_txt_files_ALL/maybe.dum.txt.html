[Chorus: Dungeon Masta]
When you cry, I cry, you cry, I cry
You cry, I cry, look what you done to me
Got mad love for you girl, I just don't know how to say
Can't stop thinking of you girl, hold you tight and won't let go

[Dungeon Masta]
Baby girl won't you feel good having your body
Laying down here on satin sheets
Come home from work, have ya bath made
And ya dinner ready, ready to rub ya feet
Wipe ya tears from ya face, what's wrong?
Do you want me to go in the crib and grab that heat
Cuz I don't wanna hear anybody around here
Fucking with you, while you in these streets
It's ok, I understand that we gotta keep the secrets
In between the sheets, cuz we don't ever want
You know who, to find out that you're a freak, my nasty girl
Ooh, you know chase young got them flows
But I'mma play the background though
This is something that I can't ignore
Damn it never felt like this before
For you ma

[Hook: Dungeon Masta]
We don't not need to be alone
Girl, just ride, with, me
You'll see. I take you where you need to be

[Chorus]

[Dungeon Masta]
Girl me and you, care for each other
Even though, we're with another
I want you near me, I need you here
I know you feeling me like I'm feeling you
Girl, so have no fear
It wasn't planned, for me to fall for you
Girl you got me twisted, what I'm gonna do
I have to assist you, don't see you miss you
I'll give anything in this world just to hold you &amp; kiss you, yeah

[Hook 2X]

[Dungeon Masta]
Baby girl, does it feel good
Having your man talk to you any way he feels
Instead of honoring you for the queen you are, fuck sex appeal
Hold you close and tight, when the ring come down
You know the mood is right, I'll take it light
Damn, why you clinch a nigga appetite
I just wanna make love to you all night
It's ok, it's kinda new to me, taking this nice &amp; slow
Cuz I don't wanna ever fuck up with you, my darling, you don't know
How Dungeon roll, ooh
Maybe, you're the one for my soul
You want long term? Let's go
This is something that I can't ignore
Damn it never felt like this before
For you ma

[Hook]
