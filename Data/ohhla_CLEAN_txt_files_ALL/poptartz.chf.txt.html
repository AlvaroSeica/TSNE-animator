[Popa Chief]
Everybody jump, like Pop Tarts out the toaster
I propose a toast, fiesta forever
We gon' make it pop, til the bubbles stop
Make some noise if ya ass love hip hop
Guess who's back, on the wall, half again
Popa Chief Choke-A-Lot, Last of the Mohicans
Fade to black, on this, flick ya bitch
While I burn my biscuits and butter your grits
I got something hot and heavy, tucked for the hater that
Bark like pits and bite like gators
Greed propels me, I know ya'll smell me
I seen and did it all, so it ain't nothing you can show and tell me
Last of the Mohicans, super disciple
Nice with the rifle, dick harder than the Eiffel
I tower over peons, I'm a Maybach, your a Neon
I been there and beyond, colder than Frion
Automatic fire, any track that we on
Looking for a nasty bitch to pee on
They thought it couldn't happen, said it couldn't be done
Built my Burnt Biskut empire from a crumb and a guitar strum
To the penthouse baby...</pre>
