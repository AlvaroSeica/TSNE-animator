[Intro/Outro]
Yeah... uh-huh
I like the way you work it girl, uh-huh
I like the way you move it baby, yeah
I love the way you're workin it girl {*2X*}
I love the way you're doin it girl
I love the way you make it work
I love the way you're doin it girl, I love it

[Greg Nice]
On the dancefloor she be breakin it down
Workin it low, like yo it ain't nuttin
Uhh, oh, yo, now that's my type
Solo key yo, but she get hype
A shot of tequila, with a little Red Stripe
We do nasty, all damn night
We don't fuss yo, and we don't fight
Make it rain, clear it out, aiyyo, aight?

[Chorus]
I like the way you work it girl, that's what's up
And when you drop it low girl, that's what's up
The way you back it up girl, that's what's up
I like how you shakin it, that's what's up
I like the way you work it girl, that's what's up
And when you drop it low girl, that's what's up
The way you back it up girl, that's what's up
And I love the way you work it girl that's what's up

[Greg Nice]
Amazing how she work that body
No doubt about it, know she a hottie
Ain't no broke chick, got her own shit
Ain't no punk bitch, splurge a little bit
Rock the hell out the baseball cap
Pump, wifebeater, blue jeans, she all that
Everyday girl with that special twist
You know I put her name up on my guest list

[Chorus]

[Greg Nice]
When she walk inside, the whole club freeze
Stone cold fox like zero degrees
We scramble it up like eggs and cheese
Jet black hair, think she from Belize
When she walk through the crowd, she leave a trail
Scent and aroma smell like Chanel
Open wide, trapped in your spell
I'm feelin on your booty like R. Kel'

[Chorus]

[Greg Nice]
Aiyyo she always got two girlfriends with her
Ain't gon' front yo one got a shitter
Other one always yappin 'bout Twitter
Caught me lookin at her girlfriend's shitter
Love the way she workin but I still hit her
Guess you could call me a greedy go-getter
Homeboy asked me why do I sweat her?
Go against the grain even though I know better

[Chorus]
