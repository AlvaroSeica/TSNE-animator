[Lil' Troy]
you know this ballin dont never stop
Short Stop we gon' ball for life
got the new junior mack comin out for
ya'll little T2 he gon' keep on ballin
shot callin for the short stop
say T2 show e'm what you got baby
ya'll know this my son

[Verse One: T-2]
I'm about to do this thing ego-style
too cold with my frees and flows high G's
and lows Short Stop bout to hit you out
I'm in the mix to ball sittin fat
yeah he did that big lacs ya'll gotta brag
young cat with the act to mack
sharper then the creese of your slacks
I did one song and got carried away
If I could recall your boy got carried away
so many kisses and hugs like I'm married today
if I have a girl she love me she stare at my face
but I live my life with a ballers choice
practice my game on a thousand-broads but you know
this young baller is certifide dont look at my ice
it'll hurt your eyes now the snake and the rat
tryna kill my plan
I'm like Samuel L. Jackson I'm still the man maan!

[Chorus:Troy and T-2 rp.2x]
big ballin smashin
makin my ends
Short Stop and we at it again
I'm in the game and we playin to win
Back To Ballin shot-callin again
big ballin smashin
makin my ends
T2 and I'm at it again
I'm in the game and we playin to win
Back To Ballin shot-callin again

[Verse Two: T-2]
I'm the younger baller but I'm alright
with that dark shades,dark hat
I'm the coolest cat I got too much game
for you to fool this cat I spit lyrics on
a track like a oozie on-max
my Daddy told me bite my teeth around
a switch he also told me fight my sleep
around a chick and then he told me
he paid the price fa sho so what wrong road
that he took I wouldnt have to go
now I'm the center of attention and my class
is broke now I can rap,write,and recite
fast or slow movie scrips,oozie clips,Jacuzzi
freaks it sound cool wit me if you dont work
then you dont eat so move back get some motion
playa move your feet now I'm steppin
through this industry rooflessly
I got the young world whisperin who is he?

[Chorus:Troy and T2 rp.2x]

[Verse Three: T-2]
when it comes to basketball I'ma cold young
fella ask Lil'Romeo we was in the
hoop-it up together
now you might see me in a movie on BET
called "Wanna Be A Baller"
stares my pops and me
guess I like to have fun and thats fa sho
hit the skatin rink and show you how fast I go
when we dance on stage we prefromin life
I had to stop I heard this girl say I was fine
so I stopped my groove to see what was up
when I got too close man she grabbed me on my butt
so I asked her for her number and see wrote it down
thats how we do it in H-town
now I know exactly why your girl's likin me
the bling in my chain and the gliem in my teeth
now my name is T-2 and it stands for Lil'T
now I'm burnin up the charts like my boy Jay-Z

[Chorus:Troy and T-2 rp.2x]
big ballin smashin
makin my ends
Short Stop and we at it again
I'm in the game and we playin to win
Back To Ballin shot-callin again
big ballin smashin
makin my ends
T2 and I'm at it again
I'm in the game and we playin to win
Back To Ballin shot-callin again</pre>
