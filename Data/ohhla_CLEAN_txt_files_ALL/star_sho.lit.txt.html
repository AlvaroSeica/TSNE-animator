You like that? You like that, now, don't
you like that, so, why act like you
don't like... Cause you like... That-that dude
You like that? You like that, now, don't
you like that, so, why act like you
don't like that, th-that that-that who?
Little Prince, that, th-that that-that's who!

Man, I'm so darn hungry I could eat fried toenail clippings
with toast or biscuits, highly low intake
I'm normally spitting; got to go in
hey, my stomach keeps tripping
Man, don't stress me more than indigestion
more less the toilet gets the blessing
crap over crap smells similar to crap
like a rat turd after a similac sandwich
Gritty as my hands get, little sanitizer
could kill the germs debating me
the lyrical MacGuyver, rubberband and paperclip
a city with a rhyme your current candidate
would fail to think of while behind bars
all 'cause I got that MARTA CARD
I Make A Rapper Think Atlanta Carry All Retarded Dummies
catch them like an animated barbie doll off in the dressing room
with make-up and a barbie doll, but you like that...

You like that? You like that, now, don't
you like that, so, why act like you
don't like... Cause you like... That-that dude
You like that? You like that, now, don't
you like that, so, why act like you
don't like that, th-that that-that who?
Little Prince, that, th-that that-that's who!

Hats off to bunghole burglars and work-at-home murderers
ya'll just inspire me so
but if one more word uttered from one of ya'll pervs
trying to touch young girls curves and turn them absurd
I might have to reinact attacks our present government
is steadily sliding back to after blacks
acquire information to rise over the nation
AIDS gets created and the Bible's getting hate
though indeed, I need to plant and water seeds
I pray to God, label it a message for a G
that I clown and turn a frown upside down
in a town where a baby's found upside down on the ground
why the busters stay afraid to say it
I'm on the grind as these suckers let the paper chase them
run, as I calculate upon a problem solved
but, till I conjure a solution
I won't bother ya'll, because you like that...

You like that? You like that, now, don't
you like that, so, why act like you
don't like... Cause you like... That-that dude
You like that? You like that, now, don't
you like that, so, why act like you
don't like that, th-that that-that who?
Little Prince, that, th-that that-that's who!

You like that, you like that, but don't
move like that, you might crack your bones
truly... don't do that... that might hurt
This so tight, you might smack your mom
get kicked out and crawl right back home
see what life's about on your own
God gets calls without mobile phones
so, in life, you ain't all alone
quick like any knife 'cross your throat
truly... don't do that... that might hurt
Being of the days that we live today
it's unbelievable, the president ain't killed us yet
but, I guess we wait until a bomb is thrown
to lose our very little living space we call a home
but you like that...

You like that? You like that, now, don't
you like that, so, why act like you
don't like... Cause you like... That-that dude
You like that? You like that, now, don't
you like that, so, why act like you
don't like that, th-that that-that who?
Little Prince, that, th-that that-that's who!</pre>
