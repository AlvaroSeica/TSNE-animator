Typed by: AZ Lyrics

They shippin' that Lam to the crib while I'm on tour
When I get off of this bus, it's gon' be pedal to the floor
'fore a nigga even set foot through the do' it's gon' be laps in that hoe
Dolo. Fool, I ain't got time for no bitches
But I do gotta Rolex where my long sleeves endin'
A house on my wrist. A car on each pinky
I got all of this, from laughin' at them lames while I'm rollin' up my sticky
Lightnin' strike again. Jet Lifers, niggas always rewritin' history
Fools hear our verses &amp; rewrite that shit, they scriblin'
Bitches see my bitches &amp; consider tryin' women
I pulled up drunk. Talkin' shit. In the lobby of my buildin'
Push the button in the elevator took it straight to the ceiling
Doors open in the livin' room, that's penthouse, pimpin'
Yehh, girl I did it
I'd advise you to play yo position 'fore you see another hoe in yo jersey tryna score thirty, ya heard me?
A nigga been focused since I said Hi to her
We higher than the Eiffel. You suckas is like fools
Fool, who designed you? Nigga, I was built to make sure this sucka shit get killed
Homie Ima well, big muhfuckin fish
Of course you gon' see a ocean where I live
Of course if I rolled it that's top shelf hemp
Of course she got them Jordans on tryna impress him
Titties out, when I fall in. Bring the whole city out
I did it for Slim.... Jet Life</pre>
