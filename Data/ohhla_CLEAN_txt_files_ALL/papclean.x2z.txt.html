[Xzibit]
Yes
1996 marks the beginning of the new era
The dysfunctional member, of the Alkaholik family
It's Xzibit, heh
Yeah

(Verse 1)
Sometimes, I wonder if it's all worth my while
Xzibit stay versatile with million dollar lifestyle
And I can feel it as a child growin' up
The brothers that was real and the brothers that was scared to buck
It's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few
You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you
Ease off the trigger talk, you ain't killin' it
It's not affectin' me
Or the clique that I'm rollin' with
I don't believe the hype about Woof tickets
You make a gang of noise and never seen like a cricket
I guess that's why we never kick it
A lot of rappers is
Soft and get tossed, tryin' to come through the Likwid
How many rappers do you know like this
Always claimin' that they're ridin' but they really ain't shh
It don't make sense
Either you a soldier from the start
Or a actor with a record deal, tryin' to play the part
Like that

Chorus: Xzibit
It's a shame
You only in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame, extra large
It's a shame
You only in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame
Paparazzi

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
I don't need no lights, no cameras
All I got is action
Never no superstars, save that for Michael Jacksons
So my composure is kept while others start to sweat
Emergin' from the fog with my F'ed up dialogue
Tryin to live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt
And people you spent it on
Would not give a (What)
Now that's deep, how deep
It's deeper than Atlantis
Home of the scandalous, big bad Los Angeles
Dangerous, vandalous, yo
Not to be trusted
Perpetray like you hard, not bein' scarred by the boulevard
Pullin' all cards and saying, "Gin," as I begin
Flowin' like liquid
Soul take it to your chin
I break it down, my sound, surrounds like
Death
From the west, put your whole city to the test
It's all in perspective
Breaker one-nine copy
This is for the people gettin' caught up in the paparazzi

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 3)
You can smoke
Stress and cross dress, Xzibit play the back
While you goin' through schemes and pipe dreams for a contract
Real tightly rolled, buck 'em all, that's how I feel
Made a cool half mil before I had a record deal
Therefore, you look and stare like it's magic
But too much of anything can make you a addict
Whenever it's time for static, break out the automatic
I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate
But wait
Who dares to cross this path
Xzibit built to last
Cut, slash, make a bloodbath
So on behalf
Of all the players I get drunk with
Smokin' blunts with
I dispose on your punk [{*shit*}] (Hoo-HOO!)
Yes
And keep it all in perspective
Carbon copies
Gettin' caught up in the Paparazzi

[Xzibit]
Once again
It's the Likwidation Crew (Yes)
And I return, for you, like this

Repeat Chorus Twice</pre>
