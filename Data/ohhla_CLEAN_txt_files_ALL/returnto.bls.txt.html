Song:   Return to the Source
Typed by: bless1music@gmail.com

One day I will return to the source
One day (one day one day one day) I will return to the source
(one day one day one day)

They say heaven's when you're in the close proximity of God
And your ideal paradise is deeper than the fa√ßade
Of chubby angels with harps floating on a cotton cloud
Implied messages before are now spoken loud
Since a youngin' I wrestled with these scenes conjured
Similar to St. Nick in ice castles yonder
I wonder if my eyelids shut for the last time
Will I return reborn or face the All Divine
No diss to Jesus, but I want to see Moms first
My arms thirst a hug from a beautiful swan nurse
Born to be reclusive, but sometimes the calm hurts
This is medication and I'm hooked without arm squirts
He longer you live, the more heaven's like a family reunion
With no set calendar date
Pray and we face that vague celestial residence
Hoping it exist when we return to the essence

I will return to the source
One day   (one day one day one day) I'll will return to the source
(one day one day one day)

One..day..baby...one day, one day</pre>
