(Juicy J)
We gon' always stay super trippy mane!

(Screwed voice)
Geeked up off them bars
Geeked up-geeked up off them bars
Geeked up off them bars
Geeked up-geeked up-geeked up-geeked up
Geeked up off them bars
Geeked up off them bars
Geeked up-geeked up off them
Geeked up off them-geeked up off them

(Verse 1, Juicy J)
I'm on them Xanax bars, my weed is medical
I'm on them Xanax bars, my weed is medical
I'm on them Xanax bars, my weed is medical
And I ain't had nothin to eat but some edibles (Yes sir!)
Drink a lotta Gin; In love with a stripper (You know it!)
Juicy J; One crazy high ass nigga (You know it!)
Throwin money in the club, bitches takin pictures (You know it!)
And we keep that Moet flowin like a Bar Mitzfah (You know it!)
In the bottle section, bouncin on a leather couch (Fuck it!)
Money err'where, bouncin out the Louis pouch (Fuck it!)
I ain't Willy Wonka; I don't sugar coat shit (Never!)
I keep Codeine in my cup, with a Sprite mixed (Wooo!)

(Hook X3)
I'm geeked up off them bars
So geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars
So geeked up off them bars

(Verse 2, Juicy J)
Fifty bars in a party bag; Swag (Wooo!)
And some weed from Afghanistan; Swag (Wooo!)
I'm on football; I hit the Superbowl (You know it!)
And I live in a liquor store (I'm there!)
I'ma stop buyin weed; I'ma make it grow (I'm there!)
I'ma stop burnin weed; I'ma make it smoke(Trippy!)
I ain't no Medical Doctor; But I am self-presrcribed (Yes sir!)
I ain't that nigga cause of them Sushi; But I got the eyes(I'm high!)
Before I hit the plane; I'm already in the sky (Thought you knew!)
Two weeks later, I'm still in the sky (Thought you knew!)
G-6 Jet (What!?), Make them pussies wet (Let's go!)
Have you ever snorted Xanax? (Uh!)
Some trippy shit... (Bitch!)

(Hook X4, to fade)
I'm geeked up off them bars
So geeked up off them bars
I'm geeked up off them bars
So geeked up off them bars</pre>
