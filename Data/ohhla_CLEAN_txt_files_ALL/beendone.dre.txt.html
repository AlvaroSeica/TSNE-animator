[Intro/Chorus One]
I been there (been there) and done that (done that)
You got guns? (We got guns) Yo, I got straps (we got straps)
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit cause that's all they worth (uhh)
I been there (been there) and done that (done that)
You got guns? (We got guns) Yo, I got straps (we got straps)
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit cause that's all they worth

[Dr. Dre]
No question, it's all about the D-O-E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryin to stick around for Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2G
Since way back, I've been collectin my fee
With the 48 tracks and the M-I-C
Got a palace in the Hills overlookin the sea
It's worth 8, but I only paid 5 point 3
Worldwide, like the triple beam I slide
Listenin to your demo in the stretch limo
is how I ride - cartel style
Vaults stacked to the max now, a million dollar style
Niggaz wonder how, "Dre Day" every day
Trips to Montego Bay with mo' chips than Frito Lay
Floss jewels and attire, ain't nothin flyer
Straight or illegal, it's still the root of all evil; cause

[Chorus One]

[Dr. Dre]
Young black Rockefeller, hella swiss and mozarella
Pockets sweller, gettin money like a bank teller
Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that you can get
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you, keep it true
Cause most niggaz erase hoes that's out for the pesos
My woman's independent, makin dough by the caseloads
I'ma keep buildin, make a killin
Kick back relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at; you got drama, I got the gat
But we both black, so I don't wanna lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private jet, 600 Coupes, then I run Vettes
I'm livin on another level that y'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill', no sweat, water the lawn with Moet

[Chorus Two]
Been there (been there) and done that (done that)
Yo, you got guns? (We got guns) Aiyyo I got straps (we got straps)
You see a million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit cause that's all they worth
You know I been there (been there) and done that (done that)
Yo, you got guns? (We got guns) Well then I got straps (we got straps)
You see a million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit cause that's all they worth

[Dr. Dre]
This is for the millionaires, throw a stack in the air
and watch niggaz start plottin, bitches start to stare
Cause game is money, and money is game
And broke niggaz make the fo-'five flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take they ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around like my 20 inch rims
Moolah y'all, platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin, diamonds shinin, without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass and bounce
Luciano in all amounts, that's all that counts; cause

[Chorus Three]
I been there (been there) and done that (done that)
Yo, you got guns? (We got guns) Well then I got straps (we got straps)
See a million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit cause that's all they worth
You know I been there (been there) and done that (done that)
Heh, you got guns? (We got guns) Aiyyo I got straps (we got straps)
You see a million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit cause that's all they worth

[Outro]
Uhhh, yeah - uh
Yeah - uh, yeah - uh
That's right, ha
All these people out talkin about who they are, what they got
Heh, it don't even matter
Been there, done that
As long as you true to yourself, gotta be true to yourself
I was always told
If you don't stand for somethin you'll fall for anything, ha ha
Yeah, that's right!
The Aftermath, beatin up on your eardrums
Heh, gotta say whassup to King Tee, and my man Nationowl
They up in here, gotta say whassup to Chris the Glove
G-L-O-V-E, ha ha
Yeah, that's how it goes down, ha ha, yeah, ahh
This is how we comin, heh, yeah
This is how we comin y'all - you know what? Huh

I been there (been there) and done that (done that)
You got guns? (We got guns) Yo, I got straps (we got straps)
See a million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit cause that's all they worth
You know I been there (been there) and done that (done that)
Yo, you got guns? (We got guns) Heh, I got straps (we got straps)
You see a million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit cause that's all they worth
