[Tekitha]
Boy, you can remember my stories
Those things my mother said
She told me Fairytalez, before I went to bed
Spoke of happy endings, then kept me in the cold
She turned my night light off, and kissed my face good night
My mind was filled with visions, of perfect paradise
She told me everything, she said it'd be so nice
He'd run up on his horse and take me away one night
I'd be so happy with him, we run, cannot stride
She never said that we would, push, cry, scream and lie
She never said that maybe some day he'll say goodbye

[Chorus 4X: Tekitha]
My fantasy is over, my fantasy, fantasy

[Tekitha]
Faaaan...taasyyyy

She spoke about happy endings, of stories not like this
She said he'd slay all the rappers, cto feed the evil prince
She said he'd come to save me, swim through the stormy seas
And I'd understand the story and it wouldn't be good me for
You never came to save me, you let me stand alone
You left me the son and left, alone in the cold
I... found a magical trojan
Don't.... let me spread my wings to fly
I... I've gone from cold to stormy, tonight
No running kiss could save me baby, no magic spells
My fantasy, oh baby, my life must all begin

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
