[Verse One: Snoop Lion]
Days like these are days I love, runnin 'round goin nowhere
Glad I get this brilliant time, smilin 'cause I know that I'm the one that makes you smile
Love the way you say my name, and how you laugh at all the
Stupid things I say, it's all love and no hate
Hangin with you while your hangin hangin on my arm, and I like it
Your hand on my back while we drivin drivin in my car, and I like it

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Iza]
This is the good good, this is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it, right on time
This is the good good, and now that we got it
We gotta keep it goin strong goin strong gotta keep it goin on, yeah
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin on, yeah
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin on, yeah

[Verse Two: Snoop Lion]
Anytime I'm feelin alone, there'll be a text from you on my phone
Just to say your thinkin of me, and when we in it hard I know it's only me you see
Love the way you have my back, and how when I make no sense
You still understand, when nobody else, can
Your hand on my hand while we kissin kissin in the dark, and I like it

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Iza]
This is the good good, this is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it, right on time
This is the good good, and now that we got it
We gotta keep it goin strong keep it strong gotta keep it goin on, yeah
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin on, yeah
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin on, yeah

[Bridge: Snoop Lion]
All this love, is the best love it could ever be
And I get, hiiiiiiiggggggghhhhhh!!!! on you and me

[Chorus: Snoop Lion &amp; Iza]
This is the good good, this is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it, right on time
This is the good good, and now that we got it
We gotta keep it goin strong keep it strong gotta keep it goin on, yeah
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin on, yeah
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin on, yeah
This is the good good, this is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it, right on time
This is the good good, and now that we got it
We gotta keep it goin strong keep it strong keep it keep it goin on, yeah
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin on, yeah
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin on, yeah
