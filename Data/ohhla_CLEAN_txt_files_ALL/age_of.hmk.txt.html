[Ill Bill]
I got the bandana over my face
So it's impossible to identify the father of atrocity
Modern day Agathocles, use modern machines
Topple regimes, we conquerors from Compton to Queens
We build and destroy, tearin this shit apart from the seams
I seen it with my own eyes I know it's hard to believe
'Til you see yourself startin to bleed
'Til you see Moses standin on the edge of a cliff partin the Sea
Now we watch the seven head of the Statue of Liberty
Being thrown down on the streets of Manhattan literally
Better yet the head of Daniel Pearl, welcome to a brand new world
N.W.O., +New Edition+ like "Candy Girl"
My uncle spent New Year's Eve 2008
on Rikers Island half-asleep with a shank
One eye wide open like the CBS logo
with multi-national corporate criminals with Polo fits

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
{"Heavy metal correction"}
{"We be causin a mosh pit like cro-mags at L'amours"}

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm the Van Allen Radiation Belt, I'm the thunder clapper
They call me Kenneth Bianchi from what I've done to rappers
Spiritual difference between the son and master
This the genesis, I only just begun the chapter
Russian AK's, Pana with the polo on
I was rockin that in eighty-eight before your solo song
Do whatever the fuck I want, I know it's wrong
Call me the proper name of God like Jehovah's mom
Y'all muh'fuckers got guns, we got an arsenal
Mao said to read too many books is harmful
Mind is from Harvard, my heart is blacker than charcoal
Hold the pen so tight damage my metacarpals
Y'all should take mescaline tabs, I think it's sound advice
I'm the molecular biology of paradise
I am Satanist, I am Buddha, and I am Christ
I'm Cus D'Amato in eighty-four, I'm +Iron Mike+

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(So who you think this is?)
{"The heavy metal king"}
BRRAP! Heavy Metal Kings
BRRAP, BRRAP! William Cutty
Hahahahahaha... O'Drama Bin Laden
Hahahahaha...
