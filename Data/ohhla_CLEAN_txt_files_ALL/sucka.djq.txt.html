(Sucka)
(Sucka)
(Sucka)
(Ha?)
(Now a sucka raises up off of you)

Did you miss me?
It took a little time to get sucka-free
But since a young g it's PPC 
Ain't no shame in the name
And still true to the game
Still servin suckers, just the same
No sense, and dwellin in the past tense
I roll with Quik, so you better check your ladies, gents
Cause I'ma teach her how to break you, right before I break her
After I make her, then I shake her
Yeah, I know, you heard it all before
But I can't deal, cause I see you're still simpin for a hoe
Claimin pimp, but you're payin for the pu'
Silly sucker, punk muthafucka
They only flock and jock
Cause you're fillin up they pocketbooks
And you're still judgin bitches by they looks
When it's really all about what she can do for you
I do for me and still see a True
Ah-ha, really? Do you hear me, bro?
Got your name all on your lips, but your chick trips
Oh no, never will I lower to your level
And I got 17 for ya, devil
Too True to ever let a sucker like you 
Make me do somethin that I don't wanna do
I'm still real with it, you gots to deal with it
I serve that ass like a clocker, I don't give a fuck
But who you're doin, how you're doin
Or what you do it with
You better miss me with the dumb shit
So when you're speakin on the Playa Hamm or my nigga Quik
Everybody knows you're suckin on a fat dick
It ain't nothin to nuttin in your ass, so that you see clear
Boomin in your ear, so I know you hear
Bump this in your Coupe with your R&amp;B wanna-be-me
Trick-ass, I'm sucka-free</pre>
