[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Uh-oh, uhh~! We're baaaaaack
Snowgoons, Lost Cauze
I fuckin hate, RAP! Get 'em

[Chorus]
I am the best, come on say it with me
Fuck rappers, Reef is my favorite emcee
I am the best, come on say it with me
Fuck rappers, Reef is my favorite emcee
I am the best, come on say it with me
Fuck rappers, Reef is my favorite emcee
I am the best, come on say it with me
Fuck rappers, fuck rappers

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Yo this beat is snappin, the streets is crackin
This beat is madness, release the Kraken
Oh yes we back and you are gonna feel this shit
It's the Snowgoons and I'm fuckin Frostilicus
An animal that wandered in, straight from the wilderness
And I ain't talkin YouYube when I say I got a million clips
For the past seven years, me and my peers, tell me homey who rappin better?
Who kill every track? Who brought Philly back? Nigga check that trackin record
Yeah you heard right, I said my words right
Live from Germany and I am like, the Third Reich
That was his third strike, game off the plate
And my wolves have you screaming "Please get 'em off my face"
Uhh too late, now you food for the dogs, woof woof little nigga
I'll bring the pain, open up your brain
Straight up move move you little nigga
When I rock my stock go, shoot straight through the roof little nigga
And what I say next ain't nothin but the honest truth little nigga

[Chorus]

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Y'all know I birthed you, I changed and burped you
I'm your fuckin daddy I got you your pair of first shoes
I dipped them in gold, I'm vicious and cold
I get to spittin fast and shit like I listen to Bone
These niggaz wanna jam with the best
but they soft as butter B, fuck with me, son I be 
tterly dumpin these wannabes underneath Sunny Creek
Kids dressin like Young MC
Funny these breeze melody
I'm one of these O.G.'s bumpin Sunny D, runnin streets
with a ton of weed and a gat I demean
Got the Mac with me like +Always Sunny+ see
Bitch nigga chill, this nigga ill
When you rhyme I'm like this nigga still
tryin I'm dyin, I'd like it if this nigga got killed
For the hell of it, I blaze that kush for smell of it
We got that la-la blaze that la-la like that poor Carmelo bitch
Ughhhh~! You write poems (yeah) and make mellow hits
I'm on a felons list, for the best in this, may you rest in shit
You wretched prick, I'll get arrested if
the way I'm blessin shit has set a precedent
You know the rest of it

[Chorus]
