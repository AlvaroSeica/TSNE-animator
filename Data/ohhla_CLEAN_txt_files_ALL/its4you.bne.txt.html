(Intro, Bizzy Bone)
Yeah, this is to young Timothy
Faithful servant of Jesus Christ, what up my nigga?
This is for Stanley House, faithful servant of Jesus Christ [Hook begins, overlapping intro]
Yeah, and everybody that's sittin down there in lock down love;
Faithful servants of Jesus Christ

(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
It's for ya, it's for ya, it's for ya, it's for ya
It's for ya, it's for ya, it's for ya, it's for ya
It's for ya, it's for ya, it's for ya, it's for ya
It's for ya, it's for ya-ya-ya-ya-ya

(Verse 1, Bizzy Bone)
For all of my homies; prison tears
Locked up, for many years
With 23-hours lockdown, and one hour to clear
Never no fear, livin in dreams, and you can't wait until you hear-
Your named called to leave and go home but, don't miss your peers
Everyone tellin you don't come back and write as often as you can
Like Flesh-n-Bone Samuel, your man-man one Daniel
The plan wasn't a problem, the actions it made it soppable
My salvation had mortared 'em, with Jesus callin an audible
Dear Father, you know that I love you; Tell me, how was we born?
In a matrix? In a maze?
Or a haze or a storm?
And terminology was probable
Babylon; you too hostile
Haiti; it was so crazy
And my thoughts stick to the hospital

(Hook)

(Verse 2, Layzie Bone)
Talent is everything, time is so precious-precious-precious
Worldly wicked lessons, but you still livin
So we can't forget to count our blessins
Hold on, do what you go to do to come home
It already been too long, nigga when you touch down it's on; stay strong
Back with bone, tell them niggas in there we real out here
Hold it down for these babies, represent and we still out here
In the field out here, tryin'a get my hands on a meal out here
It's all year to shine, it's all year to shine-shine-shine

(Hook)

(Verse 3, Layzie Bone)
Whatever you need, I got you bleed
Relax n chill, it's on me
It was hard for a minute but it's better right now
Back the way it's supposed to be
Can't wait for the day that you close to me
How we used to be; my brother
Them house boys in the building, still cooler than a motherfucka

(Bizzy Bone)
Some of 'em wait for the rest of the days, for every change
Oh, who wrote Corinthians shall never be shamed, and never be blamed, and never be tamed
My heart and soul full of love;
For all of my people that's on lock down love
This for the judge
