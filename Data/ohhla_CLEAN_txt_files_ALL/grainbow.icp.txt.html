[Chorus x3]
How the fuck could this be?
Up in the sky?
There is a rainbow over the hood!

See we got homes abandon fires flare
Don't dare walk down over there
Hookers, pimps oxi80's
Trailer park meth labs, crack babies
In the spot workin' cook up
Walk outside
Take a look up!
It's a Rainbow over the city
Look back down aroun' you, Shitty!
Gosh, just heard trailers are lurkin'
Yet still i hear the birds are chirpin'
This world ain't meant for this
So much bliss but easy to miss
Rubbers on the sidewalk, used syringes
Stuck in a hotel 2 week binges
Look high in the sky to remind you
Even if you're lost rainbows will find you!

[Chorus x4]
How the fuck could this be?
Up in the sky?
There is a rainbow over the hood!

Built with aids, pepsi, coke
I ain't talkin' pepsi
Cracksmoke all in the rain
Down the drain moms in pain need that boy in her veins
It's so hard so many distractions
So much negative action
Keeps your attention placed
Off the magic, and on the waste!
If you see a rainbow look quick
Potholes will wreck yo shit!
Don't get caught dreamin' I hope
Your head might get locked in the scope!
If your standin' there lookin' at a rainbow
You might wonder, where'd your brains go?
For everyone that wanna see you succeed
A hundred mo' wanna see you bleed!

[Chorus x2]
How the fuck could this be?
Up in the sky?
There is a rainbow over the hood!

Cars on blocks
Shriveled up rose
Skys above our windows
Body in an alley wit blew out brains
There'll still be a rainbow after it rains!
Rainbows don't hate or discriminate
Its mankinds fate to create mistakes
Just look at the skys above the gutta'
Above the warzones
Above each other!
Rainbows stretch over lands of ruin
Where troubles brewin' whatever we doin'
Don't live blind a sheep in line
Find it save the best of yo' time!
G codes street codes rules I drop
I only get this one chance I won't drop
It's more than I got imma find the pot
At the end of the rainbow like it or not
I'm not gonna rot
Stop on the block
Shot by a cop in the parkin' lot
When my feet stop least I've gave it a shot
No regrets when my death goes pop!

[Chorus]
How the fuck could this be?
Up in the sky?
There is a rainbow over the hood!</pre>
