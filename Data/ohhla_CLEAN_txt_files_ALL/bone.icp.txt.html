Has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, your Honor
We the jury find the defendant guilty on all counts

The bailiff came at me with a pair of cuffs in his hand
He was taking me to jail, but that wasn't my plan
I broke the arm off my chair, stabbed him hard as I can
He got the bone
HE GOT THE BONE!

I jumped over the others and kicked the door down with my feet
Ran down the steps and headed right into the street
Waved down a car, the driver stopped and looked at me
He got the bone
HE GOT THE BONE!

I hit the gas and I'm swerving in and out of my lane
Coppers on my tail, I'm driving like I'm insane
Old man in the street crossing slowly with his cane
He got the bone
HE GOT THE BONE!

Smash into a post, I jumped out of my car
Hopped over a wall, running through someone's yard
Ran into a house, the father tried to be hard
He got the bone
HE GOT THE BONE!

Why do they fuck with me
When I'm having fun?
They get the bone
Why do they fuck with me
When I'm on the run
They get the bone
Why do they fuck with me
Cause I ain't the one?
They get the bo-o-o-o-one

I busted out through the front doors and I booked down the block
The neighbors joined the chase, someone's shooting a glock
The mailman tried to stop me, but I picked up a rock
He got the bone
HE GOT THE BONE!

Police screech around the corners with they red and blue lights
I threw some fucking nerdy off his ten-speed bike
But the kid was an athlete and he wanted to fight
He got the bone
HE GOT THE BONE!

I ran into a rest'raunt, busted into the kitchen
Workers on my ass, and the cooks they was bitchin
A hero blocked the door, I grabbed a knife, did I mention
He got the bone?
HE GOT THE BONE!

Out into the alley, took the stairs up to the roof
Chopper busting shots at me and I ain't bullet proof
I threw a rock up at the gunman, and blew out his tooth
He got the bone
HE GOT THE BONE!

Why do they fuck with me
When I'm having fun?
They get the bone
Why do they fuck with me
When I'm on the run
They get the bone
Why do they fuck with me
Cause I ain't the one?
They get the boooooone

Cut through the parking lot I ran up into the mall
Pigs, people, cars, cooks, choppers and all
Throwing shoppers off the escalator, watching them fall
They got the bone
THEY GOT THE BONE!

Absolute pandemonium all over the place
Everybody dropped they shopping bags and joined in the chase
Rent-a-cop tried to tackle me, got kicked in the face
He got the bone
HE GOT THE BONE!

Stole his fucking golf cart and bust through the glass
Side-swipe the manikin and cut across the grass
Some fucking kid ordered me to stop, I plowed his ass
He got the bone
HE GOT THE BONE!

Police shot the tires out, my ride is a joke
I'm surrounded by an army, quickly losing all hope
I threw my ninja poof ball, disappeared into the smoke
They got the bone
THEY GOT THE BONE!

Why do they fuck with me
When I'm having fun?
They get the bone
Why do they fuck with me
When I'm on the run
They get the bone
Why do they fuck with me
Cause I ain't the one?
They get the boooooone

[Girl scout]
Hello, mister!
I hope you weren't sleeping?
Would you like to buy some girl scout cookies

[Deep-voiced man]
Oh. Cookies, huh?
That sounds really good right about now
What kind do you got?

[Girl scout]
Oh my gosh! You sound really scary!
Why do you sound like that?

[Deep-voiced man]
What do you mean, sweetie?
Do you have any s'mores(not sure about this word)?
Or just them Thin Mints?

[Girl scout]
M-m-maybe I should go?
You sound really weird and I'm scared!

[Deep-voiced man]
Wait! What about them Tag-Alongs?
Can I at least get a box of them bad boys?
Shit. What the fuck you wake me up for, then, bitch?
Man!</pre>
