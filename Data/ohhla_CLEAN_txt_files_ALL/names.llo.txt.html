[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Yeah, ya'll don't like name calling?
I'mma call out some names for you
Park Hill...

[Lounge Lo]
Aiyo I, love my hood, ya'll ain't got no niggas
I fuck with Killa K, Wigs, Smoke, Kaze and Bigga
Shy Slick, Ravon, Shavy and Dayshaun
Cavy and Raekwon, and Cappadon's my nigga
Funky G and them O.G.'s, Trenny and 'em
Parle, Chi King, Dave, Winny and 'em
Auntie Dauntie, Raider Ruckus, Killa Kane, Deck
Block Brawl and Techs, Street, Size and Meth
Rage, Nivs and Dub, Dove, Cooty and Doc
Black Nitty and Ock, and it's never gon' stop
Uncle Rico, D-Chills, Bread, Chico
Whoodie and Base, and 140 Tito
Sha Born, Born and Country, kept it real
When they told me that, Popa said to tell me where the blunts be
T-Tone, Scotty Wott, Shump Crump, Darkim
ShaKing, A.M.J., and Bloods, I know a lot of them
The Brim and the Stoney, the beef and the beast
Lingering Stone been home, and I been creeping the streets
And I'mma do it just for LuLu and Tweet, Larry Joe
One-Nine, Roddy Piper, Little Q and the Beast
Big Prays, Craig and Desert, Banger and Mel
Plus the Three Wild Bloods from that chick Giselle
They fuck, Spank and Nails, Dominick, Dooney and Realm
It's Park Hill, where we throw them shells
Well Terrell's locked up, and niggas like Shaq on the block
Getting that gwop up, guess who just popped up? </pre>
