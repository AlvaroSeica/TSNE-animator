What's your problem now is facing all of us right now
It's not a black problem
It's not a white problem
The problem is a social problem that's been here a long time
So take advantage of life cause you only got one life to live
Take it from Maxwell #66064
You don't wanna end up in here for the rest of your life

I used to be quick to pull a trigger and kill a nigga
Snatch up a cutie, knock the boots and go diss her like a gold digger
Go round every night, ran the streets like a red light
You couldn't tell me nothin, I was (too damn hype)
Lack of a mad trap and constantly stackin and packin
Cause where I'm from accidents just don't happen
Living in the fast lane, full speed ahead
I had kegs of juice and niggas wanted me dead
But not the G, so I kept a low pro
So I was determined not to end up with a tag on my toe
Then word got around, I was scared and went underground
Bull(sshhhh..) now how the hell does that sound?
I got the crew with the quickness
And with the swiftness we took care of business
Killin nigas on sight with no hesitation
At once we didn't slow down for smoke inhalation
Pollutin the atmosphere as we painted the block red
Bodies lied dead that was stil full of hot lead

[ CHORUS ]
Check it out sisters, you got (one life to live)
Check it out fellas, you got (one life to live)
Don't sell drugs cause you got (one life to live)
Don't go to jail cause you got (one life to live)
Just take heed cause you got (one life to live)
Everybody, you only got (one life to live)

Neighborhood villain revealin, my nine was meant for killin
I bust a cap in that ass, ha-ha, what a feelin
So never give in, my livin was never: beggin, given
Cause as a baby my ribbon was stamped: 'go to prison'
So pass the buck up, stuck up or fuck up, blew a truck up
How could I luck up, suck up, my mother put her foot up
My life was coolin and coolin, smokin a fast turnin
I seen the 5-0, being the motto: Mississippi Burning
So many learning and yearning who do rap turnin
Some go to Howard and Dower until they're back runnin
I couldn't get with it, forbid it, I stepped and bit it, hit it
Who said I did it, admit it, my brain was half-witted
Misfitted, get it, I never had a bridge
Tight walkin, we stalkin, one life to live
How could I said it, wed it
My trigger was unleaded, I mean unloaded
Hold it, I think I better blow it

[ CHORUS ]

I left the home all alone, couldn't live on the bone
Oh what a way, hey, today you gotta get your own
By any means, I mean I have to get the green
My sneakers used plus I was tired of wearin people's jeans
The only soap I knew was _One Life to Live_
When I did watch, it was in someone's spot, ya dig?
Did it get better? Nope, folks used to joke about it
I'd get mad as hell, ready to stretch and yoke about it
Some talk the talk, can't even walk the walk
I use my head, lead the lead, let the leader stalk
I dig-em-smack em, back em when I cap em
My tale was mackin, ready to do some crackin
I was so broke I couldn't afford to joke
So I had to grin, pretend like everything was okey-doke
When it's rope not love hangin in dope spots
Thinkin of blowin shots? Well, I hope not

[ CHORUS ]

I reminisce of the way back, birth, bein born to adore
Any negative vibes, yes ??????
That's how it was done when I was runnin the bricks
To a click, easy vicks, even honeys that got with this
Nobody was spared, not sayin that they shoulda been
The evil I felt inside thrived behind a silly grin
But when it was time to roll, eliminate foes
L was there, small as hell blowin holes
But yo, I wasn't knocked for the use of a strong arm
So don't think that, if you do you'll be dead wrong
Because I'm here for ki's, as I said in the last bill
Not glorifying crime, all you reap is the balls and grills
Things got rough, I had no other alternative
But strive to live, man, fuck bein positive
Yo, that was the live, 21 and I'm sung
Now I'm Almighty L #209021
