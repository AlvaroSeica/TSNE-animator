Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Stunt [x4] Stack on Deck, Soulja
Everywhere I go, people lookin at me like
Damn that boy cashed up
Damn that boy swagged up
Everywhere I be, people lookin at me like
Damn that boy cashed up
Damn that boy swagged up

Racks UP, everywhere we go [x3]
Racks UP, hundred thousand show

Girls lookin at me, lookin really fancy
Oh you so cutie, oh I'm so pretty
Oh I'm in farrari, I don't have to say sorry
Honest lil Dre, old school no atari
Soulja Boy swaggin, pretty boy handsome
Pulled off of the club, in a drop top phantom
360 bands as the roof panoramic
360 bands, oh yes I'm so dynamic
500 trap bunking like a damn fool
Ham savage shawty with a muthafuckin tool
Catch your breath bitch, yeah I'm in that new Mariah
Everybody on me with that five on the side
Shotgun shawty holdin down the whole half
Young Soulja Boy make the trap go ham
Yellow diamonds on me, yeah bitch I paid cash
500K, Mr. Digital Dash
Digital digital, everything digital
White wrist black chain, Soulja Boy I'm gettin 'em
Killin 'em killin 'em, everyday I'm rippin 'em
Put your lighters up, kush up racks up (TAKEOFF)
Young Dre, I do it big
Scarface mansions, that's how we live
Great bentley, but I got to do it in
Right shawty mane I had to put it in
Put in work in on the fuckin block
Yellow diamond brightlin, fuck a clock
Soulja Boy tell 'em yes I'm posted on the top
Mixtape bunking oh my God I'm so hot
Hot like a bitch, everybody know my name
Red bentley bitch, call that shit fire flame
Soulja Boy tell 'em, oh my God I bring the pain
VIP monday night, making it damn rain
Splash, cash yeah it's me
Yellow diamond shawty, 100 for a key
Soulja Boy tell 'em, I might charge a fee
Walking through the hood, everybody notice me</pre>
