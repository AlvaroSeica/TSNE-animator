[Hodgy Beats]
{*alarm clock*}
As some rise to a sunrise
In the same clothes from yesterdays
Though the umpire is unsound
My team is a squad who works to make a play
Look for tomorrow today is what I always say
Cause if tomorrow's today then I'm just a blink away
I find my happiness through all of this rappin shit
If it wasn't for rappin shit I'd be present with gats and bricks
The cat that scratch the itch, my skin is irritated
Eyes low from weed smoke shit I'm clearly shaded
+Sailin Jerry+ shots, bottle tops inebriated
Afraid to look in the mirror to see I really made it
I notice hour pass, I shatter the hour glass
Matter can overpower mass if it really matters
I live in the moment and not a minute after
Count the page numbers; I write the next chapter

[Chorus]
My feet are on the ground, man I'ma touch the sky
First I'ma roll this L, light it, then I'ma get real high
But I'ma seize the moment, and you ask why?
Why I'ma seize the moment, and not let shit pass me (by)

[Hodgy Beats]
Walk into the light; I know its gloomy
Find your own way, um, eventually you'll see
Life lessons get told more than a eulogy
Cruelty in a crew-a-tee, stingin like a poolabee
In a crewatee stinging like a pool of bees
You can't smoke if ain't grew the weed
You ain't shit without some jewelry
I got some homegrown and my gold on like what you do to me?
No gun around me, but I murder brutally
Vertibly, suitably ready for battle
In a battlefield use my bats for shields
And a mustang horse ridden saddle
exists in a world full of hassle
I gotta graduate so I can flip my, tassle in life
And look forward to what's next
Until death cross my body and my lungs run out of breath
It's O.F.

[Chorus] - "my feet are on the ground" </pre>
