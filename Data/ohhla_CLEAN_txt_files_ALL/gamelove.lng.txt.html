[Hook- Rock Shabazz]
When you playing the Game of Love
King of Diamonds, the Queen of Clubs
Roll the dice if she looks real nice
Spin the wheel if he deals with bills, girl
But know the rules cause you might get hurt
Read the player's manual first before you flirt
Snakes and ladders, the game's full of ups and downs
Can't tell who's the winner from the loser
What happens now?

[Rock Shabazz]
She's so used to niggaz who run game
Can't handle a nigga who's just plain
Feel flattered when they kicking them lies
Finding out they phonies why you actin surprised?
She says she wants a nigga that's perfect
When she should be looking for one she can work with
G'd up, focusing on the surface
Wants a Sugardaddy cause she feels she deseves it
She claims I'm the love of her life
Her kindred spirit, her soulmate
Baby yeah right
Cause before loving me, you was in love with him
So after loving me, you'll fall in love again
She don't love me, she just loves being in love
Cold, cynical, maybe I'm all the above
Still a one woman man, tryna tie one down
So young lady, you're the next contestant
Come on down

Me and my girl been together a couple of years
On the side I wouldn't lie I had a couple of friends
But when we had our first kid, I realized then
She was the one to keep, after that I aint mess around since
Well maybe once or twice, but still I kept it tight for my wife
And when she got suspicious, I would hit it right
'Til one day she went away for the weekend
Something's different, you not speaking
Later on that very same evening
She admitted through her tears that she was cheating
I admit it hurt, I could've gone berserk
Instead I thought about the kids and said honey lets make it work
Time past and we stuck together
But still I wonder who fucked her better? (damn!)
Man them thoughts where too much for me
I had to say au revoir, mi amor, c'est la vie,  cause

Niggaz think they pimps, niggaz think they macks
Breaking up a good thing, chasing after hood flings
Messing up a good brain now she got some baggage
You don't really got game check the girls you bagging
You not good to women, you just successful with 'em
She's used to sandpaper so she'll take your denim
Me, I'm satin, velours, silk
Smooth as Jamaal Wilkes' jumpshots
It's blunt love never coy lust
That's why they trust Jus-tice

[Crayon]
Ooops! Didn't mean to get you aroused
But most women get intrigued by a brother with style
I put it down, profound words, far from the clowns
I have your head in the clouds while you still on the couch
You might think you a playa cause you fucking his girl
But guess what: She turn around and do the same to your world
My nigga
To play the game gotta know all the rules
That's how jealous boyfriends put your face on the news
Hard to choose whether love 'em or leave em
Plenty of diseases are reasons of who you want to be with
But do remember next time you fall deep in lust
Playaz play for keeps in the game of love
Ha ha...Game of love</pre>
