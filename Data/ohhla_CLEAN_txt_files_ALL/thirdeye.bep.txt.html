Mmm
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Mmm

	[Will.I.Am &amp; Fergie]
You was foolin' me once before, but I tell ya
There's no foolin' me twice no more
Cos when I open up my third eye, my third eye
I get away with murder, murder (yeah)
You was foolin' me once before, but I tell ya
There's no foolin' me twice no more
Just stop your oppression, oppression
Check it out, I got a question, a question
Push is Pinnochio, Pinnochio
Who the hell is Gepetto, Gepetto
Beware of Gepetto

	[Will.I.Am]
Cos he got knives and clips
And a bag of that shit
With two crucifix
And he's got your back won't flick
Give it to your brother as a necklace for Christmas
Welcome to the valley of the beast
Where they sing in harmony, where they speak no peace
Keeping an eye on the fedder, your cheddar
Things that ain't really for the better
I could point out the behaviour
To keep your meal from the poisonous flavor
Then would you call, I can't say
Let me make up your mind so you're in the door danger
He can sell sand to Iran
Ice to an eskimo, water to a dam
He's a killer up for ?
The one who taught him how to stab

	[Will.I.Am &amp; Fergie]
He was fooling me once before but I tell you
There's no fooling me twice no more
Cause when I open up my third eye, my third eye
I get away with murder, with murder
Know what I'm saying

	[Fergie]
No, no, no, no, no, no
Can't fool me again, no, no, no, no, no
I'm into games you play
I know your game, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't fall down again, no, no, no, no, no, no
Won't trip on games you play
I know your game

	[Will.I.Am] (Fergie)
You can fool me once (no, no)
But you can't fool me two times (no, no)
Cause I got three eyes (yeah, yeah)
One up from the left side (yeah, yeah)
The other from the right side (yeah, yeah)
One eye on the inside (yeah, yeah)
And I can see you outside (no, no)
Plotting to come in

	[Fergie] (Will.I.Am)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (you can't fool me)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (you can't do me)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (you can't run through me)
Mmm (yeah)

	[Fergie]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Sometimes we need to change, to change, to change
Leave the past behind, leave the past behind, or shall we
Look into the future, look ahead, that's right</pre>
