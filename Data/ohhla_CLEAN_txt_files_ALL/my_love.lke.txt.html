[Intro]
Ain't no other woman that can take us from my...

[Verse One: Justin Timberlake]
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (what would you do?)
If I told you, you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (tell me would you?)
Well baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself in other girls (like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (saying I do) (uh yeah)
Because...

[Chorus]
I can see us holding hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Wanna make you my lady girl you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is by my love

(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
My love

Ain't no other woman that can take your spot my love

(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)

Aint no other woman that can take your spot my
Love
Love
My Love
My Love

[Verse Two: Justin Timberlake]
Now if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote (what would you do?)
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (tell me would you do?)
See what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl I never been more sure (that baby it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything you been watin for (just say it, I do)
Because...

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: T.I.]
Aight It's time to get it J.T., ay
I don't know what you hesitatin for man
Ay Ay Ay

Shorty, cool as a fan
On the new once again (ay)
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Ay, listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (nah)
If you got a man, try to lose him if you can
Cause the girl's real wild, throw they hands up high (oh, ay)
When they wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy (check it)
You don't really wanna let the chance go by (ay)
'Cause you ain't been seen wit a man so fly
Baby France so fly, I can go fly
Private, cause I handle mine B.I.
They me candle guy (why)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (haha)
I'd hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try (nah)
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why? (what?)
Me and you boyfriend, we ain't no tie (uh uh)
You say you wanna kick it, when I ain't so high (man)
Well, baby, it's ovious I ain't yo guy
I ain't goin lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same park, same bullet anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me a pair, I will (c'mon)

[Chorus] (*with slight variation)</pre>
