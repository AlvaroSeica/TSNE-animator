[Intro/Chorus: Sample of Ice-T 'Name Of The Game']
So you wanna be a Gangster?
So you wanna be a Gangster?
Gangsta Boogie, gangsta Boogie --------&gt; Bronx Style Bob
Gangsta Boogie, gangsta Boogie --------&gt; Bronx Style Bob
So you wanna be a Gangster?
Gangsta Boogie, gangsta Boogie --------&gt; Bronx Style Bob
Gangsta Boogie, gangsta Boogie --------&gt; Bronx Style Bob

[Verse One: Kool Moe Dee]
Fast women, fast cars, fast money, moving stars
Lights camera, different glamor
Action rolling, broken grammar
Gangster lean, threats claim, talking rage
Black and green, gold and diamonds, rides shining
Tech playing and, Moe Dee Rhyming
Living large, big mirage, top scheming, Taylor's charge
Girls want him, feds tore him, streets of Harlem, spirit modem
Chasing ladies, making babies, living shady, private and crazy
Doing crime, doing time, favorite line, this world is mine
City slicker, big nigga, more bodies than Hades of Hitler
Cold blooded killer man, Executing the killer's plan

[Chorus: Sample of Ice-T 'Name Of The Game']

[Verse Two: Kool Moe Dee]
Ha.. ha.. hardcore, encore, drug war, blood pours
Watch your back, got a pack, keep a gun, on the run
Fake wick, move slick, ladies trick, take your pick
Money rolling, pocket is swollen, wrecked whirlwind
You know you will go in, workers so in, feds showing
Money is stolen, and who's holding that;
Paranoid, self employed, can't avoid; Homeboys
Work with you, might hit you, somebody is gonna get you
Cops bust him, can't trust him, didn't talk, gotta dust him
You get him or he will get you, some police in on a two
Stand tall, take a fall, last call, take them all

[Chorus: Sample of Ice-T 'Name Of The Game']

[Verse Three: Kool Moe Dee]
Bum.. bum.. bump Rap, death trap, back trap, face back
Bad decision, blooded vision, money's missing, on a mission
In one position, steady wishing, never listened, hell is sketching
Where you're living, Do or Die, strong survive, sell a pipe
Crack heads, living dead, theirs problems, they'll solve them
No tears, who cares? ~ getting yours, taking theirs
Meanwhile, on trail, evidence on file, next stop, State Pen'
Big shot, kingpin, Scarface wanna be
Now you won't gonna see, the light clear, sure later
Sold your soul, showed your fate, bad coma, time to pay
Got to go, judgment day, sold out, now you curse
Life in jail, if they don't kill you first

[Chorus: Sample of Ice-T 'Name Of The Game']

[Outro: repeated until the end]
So you wanna be a Gangster!
So you wanna be a Gangster!!
So you wanna be a Gangster!!!</pre>
