"Oh, my, oh, oh, wait a minute
Wait a minute, he's not dead, he's not!
I like that..."

[Shawn Wigs]
Shut ya mouth, and stop that, slang prostitution
I pimp tracks, skip New Year's Resolution
Keep bad habits, I rock chinchilla, you rock rabbits
Got the Theodore Unit all engraved in my fabrics
Valors and rhinestones, signs of pine cones
My chain look like the pavement, a few rhyme stoned
Chunky, leaving me with welps on my neck
Fifty pounds of jewels, what the fuck I except?
All them Slick Rick shit, but no Children's Story
I put flags on these tracks, and fuck 'em for they glory</pre>
