[Nems]
I feel good all over
Nems the giant general, you still a small soldier
Your Mom Dukes is a shitkickin ogre
This style is hard liquor, you a kid sippin soda
I thought I told ya, I handle my B.I.
I'm from C.I. so you know ("I get down")
Nemstar don't tangle, the gemstar will bang you
("No matter how strange it seems") Listen
I run spots, that bulge is that pump pop
I ain't stupid; when I hear gunshots ("I get down")
Then I get up, let off, never let up
Y'all niggaz is pussy, really got me fed up
Got a headache? I'll knock it the fuck out
Put a knife behind your eyesocket, pop it the fuck out
Put the ratchet right in your son's mouth
and I keep squeezin on the trigger 'til the bullets run out
I might dumb out, and leave you wet
in a club doin my two-step ("I get down")
Bitches love it, show niggaz how to thug it
Smack the shit out you in public - Nems gutter

Fans are veteran - I got the ether
First year letterman - follow your leader
Oh you like Hoffa, off of the Teamsters
Fuck your life, hasta la vista~!
I thought these herbs heard me; listen up
I'm from Dirt Jersey and this how ("I get down")
Vain God's a menace, once you start you finished
("No matter how strange it seems") Listen
I'm raisin hell, I'll melt you, a New Jersey Devil
Ask around they'll tell you ("I get down")
Dead all the hype, the rebels unite
E-O-Dub, F-Y-L, it's the end of yo' life
I'm a dickhead, I talk ridiculousness
I'm an asshole I know I'm gettin you pissed
You asinine if you think you the shit
cause I can get you wiped out, with a flick of my wrist
One finger to lift, all I do is point 'em out
but if I gotta get my hands dirty ("I get down")
I don't raise my voice, FUCK what all the noise about
No apologies, coppin pleas, I don't talk it out

The talk of the town, everyone's discussin
If you can't back it up, why the fuck you frontin?
I'm down for anything always up to somethin
Leave you down for the count when I'm uppercuttin
I, thought I told you I'm makin it happen
Comin straight from Manhattan so you know ("I get down")
I'ma take yo' queen, I'ma make her scream
See my face in dreams ("no matter how strange it seems")
Listen, everyone know I get gung-ho
Soon as I hear the drumroll ("I get down")
But I get up, with shit if you down for the cause
I don't need a pat on the back, or round of applause
In a circle of squares you surrounded by frauds
Bunch of fake muh'fuckers run they mouth to the law
Can't hear y'all out; tryin to AIR y'all out
Cause it's all downhill from here on out
I need a, bottle of Stella a shot of tequila
In the club doin the Hava Negila ("I get down")
In a, squadron of killers you probably the squealer
In the concrete jungle Solomon's a gorilla</pre>
