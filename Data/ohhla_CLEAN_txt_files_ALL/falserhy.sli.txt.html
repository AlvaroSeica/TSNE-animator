Typed by: AZ Lyrics

They don't want false rhythm
Want the real thing
He say now
Me don't want false rhythm
Want the real thing
He say now
Me don't want false rhythm
Want the real-real thing lord
Me don't want false rhythm
Want the real thing
He say now
Me man who carry the world on his back
Its such a heavy but a price to pay
But then you listen to the reason and you know just why
Its hustle bustle that you live for today
Betta watch out
You best believe in the righteous man
Who puts his hands free
To show you the way
And if the road to life yes its goin up
But don't fall down you'll wind up losing the rest rest rest
Because the lord
Don't come to damn you
I said the lord
Don't come to damn you
I said the lord
Don't come to damn you
I said the lord
Don't come to damn
But I grabbed my nine and kyle grabbed the shotty
But time for us to go identify the bodies
Buckshots got you ass up in smoke
Cause you'll never feel afraid to let my kahkis hang real low
Strap with my dick on hard
But I'm laughing at the stoopid ass security guard
Who tried to take down with one punch to my brain
But then I tell them that I only smoke the marijuana jane
Because the lord
Don't come to damn you
I said the lord
Don't come to damn you
He said the lord
Don't come to damn you
Because the lord
Don't come to damn damn damn he say
Me don't want false rhythm
Want the real thing (whoa oh)
Me don't want false rhythm
Want the real thing
Me don't want false rhythm
Want the real-real thing
Me don't want false rhythm
Want the real real real real
On no the real thing
Oh no no no no no the real thing</pre>
