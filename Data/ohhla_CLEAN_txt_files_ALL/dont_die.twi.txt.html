[Madrox]
We ain't underground by accident 
Theres only a select few that can handle this
FREEK SHIT, apparation of a poltergiest
Blessed with a heart when it's cold as ice and broken twice
Now I walk with an axe
Dressed in all jet black with contacts
Straight maniac, warlock, Samhein of Salem's Lot
Sand through the hour glass tickin off the clock

[Monoxide]
If you dont know by now its too late
We the most serious thing on the market since date rape
We the dead, we don't explain or feel pain BEZERKo
Keep it underground and maintain
Bitch you better check nuts
I'm doin voodoo, leave ya 66 for 6 months
Ridin' in a dipped out hearse with gold spokes
Puffin on a two ton blunt with dead folks
And it's like that

[Chorus]
Axe Murderers!!
WE DON'T DIE!!!!!!!
SERIAL KILLERS!!
WE DON'T DIE!!!!!!!
FREEKS OF THE NIGHT!!
WE DON'T DIE!!!!!!!
WE GET HIGH!!
WE DON'T DIE!!!!!!!

[Monoxide]
Comin up outta da ground, from the underground tunnel I dug
To keep away from the mainstream love
I just want somebody to move and get hurt
Got ya hole dug deep in the dirt
Cant work with ya Bitch mother fuckers
Makin love to the press
With a bitch named tatted on your chest
Me and muhfuckin' Madrox, haunting the joint
Bringing death to the people that don't get the point
We don't die...

[Madrox]
Uh Huh, we unreal
Just like a 7 dollar bill
Voice my opinion regardless of how you feel
Freek Shit
It aint about being rich
Its about juggalos and runnin with lunatics
As long as ya'll rock this we wont quit
We do it all for y'all
I mean that shit
Everyone of y'all means everything to me
We bleed for Y'all thats why we call it family

[Chorus]

[Madrox]
We try to explain the element of my self inflicted PAIN
We're not positive or uplifted
FUCK YOU, walk a mile in our shoes
Experience hard times and payin helly dues
Freek Shit, what I live what I breathe
Cast out Mutant X like he's disease
Still they try and ban the sound
Cause supposedly it be resurrectin the dead from under hallowed ground

[Monoxide]
You in da dead zone, ten points for us
Smellin ciggarette smoke right before your lungs bust
You cant trust em, but I can bust em in half
Sit back and laugh at all the shit I did
Can you do that? Could you school that! Better yey
I'm the wigged-out serial killa type war vet

[Chorus]</pre>
