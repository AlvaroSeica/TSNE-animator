Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]

Ziplock [x5]
Doing numbers and they bustin out the ziplock
Ziplock [x5]
Game in the air like I swear I got the shit locked

[Verse]

Bustin out the ziplock
Trap out the bus stop
Say you wanna split
Only 9 miss the rerun
Damn, could've sold some rebound
30 play juice, 30 hit the juice bebop
At the texico, where that hood niggas drop
In the valley dog with my thought in the pie
Pull us some trap, hairlock
Murder trap, dead dog
Born in rebel stones, pharaoh
Zips of the purge, head shot
50 dollar lines, making real talk
We be hurling diamonds, big talk

[Chorus]

Drain lean by the zip, got the game locked
Every day I'm fresh like I pop up out the ziplock
Now your money keep them hundreds in the ziplock
Doing numbers and they bustin out the ziplock
Ziplock [x4]
Doing numbers and they bustin out the ziplock
Ziplock [x4]
Game in the air like I swear I got the shit locked

[Verse]

I'm 32 I'm cooking out the croc pot
Georgia come they so go treat that drop pop
A hundred cage and droppin at the stash son
A thousand pounds of kush tell me go drop it off
I'm looking at a digit with some 0's
I swear to God that I was broke one week ago
So did me, but sent before BP by Almaco
We're on the same time that juice was at the texico
Smoking product don't you call my spot the wire hoes
Got these age smoking at the trap hole
Tryin to duck the feds 'cause they giving phone numbers off
Before they 4b pulling I swear they probably smashing up

[Chorus]

Drain lean by the zip, got the game locked
Every day I'm fresh like I pop up out the ziplock
Now your money keep them hundreds in the ziplock
Doing numbers and they bustin out the ziplock
Ziplock [x4]
Doing numbers and they bustin out the ziplock
Ziplock [x4]
Game in the air like I swear I got the shit locked</pre>
