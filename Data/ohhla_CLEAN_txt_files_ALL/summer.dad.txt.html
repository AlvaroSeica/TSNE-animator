Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In the summer
I wake up feeling brand new
In the summer
I always find that crazy love
In the summer
I'm gonna act a damn fool
I just can't wait to to to to

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
GO go go go go go

I've seen the top of the world
But now I'm gonna take it higher
Swear I've never felt so strong
Looking down on my empire
I swept her off her feet I'm noticing
She fell for Papi Swagg
La cuenta anadiendo ceros
Pa' llevarla de gira mundial
I got the feeling that you feeling me
Baby wait a minute
Honeymoon without a wedding
Now is you with it with it

No romancing we were dirty dancing
Til the sun come rising
Like our champagne glasses
Just one moment but it's everlasting
So turn it up! Turn it up!
Time of the year that we burn it up

In the summer
I wake up feeling brand new
In the summer
I always find that crazy love
In the summer
I'm gonna act a damn fool
I just can't wait to to to to

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
GO go go go go go

Baby can I get with ya
I know you feel my ambition
See me spending all of this money
Cuz one day I knew I'd be richer
Pa' encima esta caliente el clima
No lo pienses montate en el beamer
Ten un poco de cartel tequila
Desfila baby
Take another shot and lose your top
Cause it's hot
Then you flip the bottle up and take a shot
Never stop baby
Take another shot and lost your top
Cause it's hot
Then you flip the bottle up and take a shot
Never stop baby

No romancing we were dirty dancing
Til the sun come rising
Like our champagne glasses
Just one moment but it's everlasting
So turn it up! Turn it up!
Time of the year that we burn it up

Put your hands up towards the sunlight
Get up just dance into the moonlight
Put your hands up towards the sunlight
Get up just dance into the moonlight

In the summer
I wake up feeling brand new
In the summer
I always find that crazy love
In the summer
I'm gonna act a damn fool
I just can't wait to to to to

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go</pre>
