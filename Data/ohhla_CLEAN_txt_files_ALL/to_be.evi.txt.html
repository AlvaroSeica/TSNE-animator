("Rain keeps on fallin")

[Intro: Evidence]
Where I'm from, they say the sun shine all the time
I keep seein rain.. yeah

[Evidence]
Uh, squeezin blood from a rock
Makin something out of nothing, that's something I got
That's one thing I had, while the others didn't get it
They was chasin the world, I brought it right to my block
Brought it back with a oath: stay reppin my coast
POOF~! I was blowin the spot, without knowin or not 
Not knowin a thing, tryin to prove the most 
Made it open my lane, I found my slot 
They went right, E-V went left
So +Common+, +One Day It'll All Make Sense+
Soundbombing, no way well all make ends
Survival of the fit, a few win, but most quit
Or fend for themselves, so here's to good health
Here's to drama, two up and one of 'em fell (watch out)
"Hear, hear" to that, this is for my LA Cats &amp; Dogs 
who never left, to the world we back, c'mon

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc] (Evidence)
Mmmmm, sometimes I ask myself, 
"Why would I need anyone else?" (To be determined)
To make it through this life
when everyday's a brand new fight
{Nothing to lose~!} I have struggled 
in every single muscle, always on the hustle 
(and I know) and I know I can't make it.. on my own

[Elzhi]
Had visions of bein caked up
on the Island while the weather's freezin
Whether he's in, the French Caribbean, swimmin with amphibians
or in Hawaii blowin Maui Wowie, life is good
I dodge bullet grazes, slash the knifes that coulda ended my existence
For instance, through the persistence 
that distances, me from the number of statistics
Once, a lot smaller, lookin up to shot callers 
Not ballers, they never grew up, just got taller
Tryna find freedom in a trap, hungry for success 
They eat up, this food for thought I feed 'em in a rap
I'm takin trips to France, make it rain where the strippers dance 
They unzip the pants, grippin my money clips in hands
It was hell, I thought I saw demons hidin in lost souls
Straight out the evil books inside of my far scrolls
They say you should toss goals, throw away your dreams
when nothing go your way, it seems it's done or, you feelin unsure 
Yet this what this one's for

[Aloe Blacc]
Push as hard as you want, against the wall bro
Push the wrong dude, they'll be lookin for you like Waldo
Times is harder than before when it was fun and games
When we was just spittin rhymes, tryna get a bigger name
Now car notes involved and bills require grindin
Who'da ever thought that Aloe Blacc get back to rhymin
Street philosophers could theorize it's all timing
Economist would say it's kinda rough to find a diamond
And all the silver lining in the clouds couldn't change
The simple fact that it pours when it rains -  all more of the same 
And my score in the game, let it reflect
that I earned every little bit of respect I get

[Outro: Aloe Blacc]
Ohhh, its time 
Get up off the wall, cross that line
My momma told me that every flower 
needs rain shower, like it needs sunshine
(Rest in peace ma) I know I can make it 
You know you can make it, We can make it
If you get on yo' griiiiiiiind..

[Evidence]
Rain keeps fallin down
