My name is Bow Wow!

He gotta let me in this
I'm tellin' ya me and Kelly got some serious business
Now say your price I'mma drop
Just let a nigga slide
Cause this party ain't a party if I ain't inside
(Shorty you're too young, you ain't even 21)
Playa stop it!
Where the list at?
For them young niggas with grown pockets
Beyonce' just hit my tour and your sets is jumpin'
So stop frontin' and do a little something

2 -     Boy he say he got a girl
        Yeah it's true you got a man
        But the party ain't gon' stop
        So let's make it hot, hot

1 -     Ladies leave your man at home
        The club is full of ballers and they pockets full grown
        And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends
        Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

[Beyonc√©]
Call your boys cause tonight you're not gonna stay at home
Should tell your girl she ain't comin' tonight
You're goin' solo
Cut her off when she talk some noise
You know you got the right to get your party on
So get your haircut and your car washed too
Lookin' like a star in your Armani suit
You need to look your best cause you're turnin' heads tonight
You're gonna find a sexy chica that's gonna dance all night
If you wanna

Repeat 2

Usually you can find me (Oh)
Posted up in the corner with JD beside me
Most likely I'm high

[JD]
Well every girl that look hot I'm on her
I spit to spit
Grenadine in my Corona
Talking shit to shit

[Da Brat]
Yeah
Every nigga that got a fat knot
Huh I'm on them
And if he ain't got the dough stack
Why would I want 'em? (Yeah)

Know that, if you can't supply
Picture me gone
Make this a moment for Kodak, BYE!

To a five million dollar spot

Got chicks in every city backing it up
