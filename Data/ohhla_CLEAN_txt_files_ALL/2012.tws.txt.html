[Tia London]
Ay... oh... hey-ey-eyyyy

If tomorrow, the world ends
And in the morning the sun don't seem to shine
I will stay here, forever
Standing, right by your side
You know they say, they say
They say that it's all gonna end someday
So before it does (so before it does)
Let's make love (let's make love)
Like tomorrow was

[Chorus: Tia London] + (Twista)
20-12, the last day on Earth
20-12, the end of the world
20-12, you'll be my man
(And you'll be what?) And I'll be your girl
20-12 (uh-huh) in 20-12 (uh-huh)
In 20-12, in twenty-twel-el-elve
20-12 (uh-huh) 20-12 (uh-huh)
20-12

[Twista]
Now they be tellin me that these are the last days
Are we really that close to armageddon?
If livin on the planet 'til this point has been hell
I survived cause I am legend
Well if it's all about to be over
then I wanna say you need to be my girlfriend
Hit the blunt after whirlin it near me
then you can get it in like the world finna end
It's predicted by the anciant Mayan civilization
I don't wanna see the world go soon
But with such a beautiful girl in my room
I wanna be up in you when the world go boom
Get down on your body 'til it's lights out
Makin love 'til the terminator come
Global warmin is havin a major effect
Comfort each other when we don't know which way to run
Mother Earth is about to go through another cycle
and I know that it's all gon' have to end someday

[Tia London]
But before it does (so before it does)
Let's make love (let's make love)
Like tomorrow was

[Chorus: Tia London] + (Twista)
20-12, the end of the world
20-12, the last day on Earth
20-12, you'll be my man
(And you'll be what?) And I'll be your girl
20-12 (uh-huh) 20-12 (uh-huh)
Twenty-twel-el-elve, 20-12
20-12 (uh-huh) 20-12 (uh-huh)
20-12

[Twista]
T-t-t, t-t, tomorrow it's all about to be over
so I only live to serve ya
The dark is about to devour the Earth
So come and ride with the Silver Surfer
Now-now-now will it all in from the element
of ether or artificial intelligence
As long as we both have the passion
the sexin just makes all the issues irrelevent
I know that it's all about to go
So I just sit back and blow my 'dro - blow my 'dro
(But before it does) Steady lookin at the clock
Before it's over let me make your body rock
Havin sex 'til the big bomb drop
Or 'til the planet go pop

[Outro: Tia London]
In 20-12, the last day on Earth
20-12, the end of the world
In 20-12, you'll be my man
And I'll be your girl
20-12, 20-12
20-12, twenty-twel-el-elve
20-12, 20-12, 20-12</pre>
