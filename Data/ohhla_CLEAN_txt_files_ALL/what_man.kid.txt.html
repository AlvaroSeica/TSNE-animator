[Chuck Inglish]
So I woke up this mornin and as I start yawnin
That {milk milk} pourin into my bowl
Then I thought to myself {thought thought to myself}
That I need to take a trip to the grocery sto'
Cause the bread is low, and the chicken I was eating
with the mashed potatoes need {a little bit of gold}
Oops wrong song lyric, meant a little bit of pepper
Step out the crib with the bearclaw slippers
Robe tied tight, chest no chest hairs
Sto' close at fo' so I gotta get there
Cause it's like 3:50 and I'm just waking up
And it take five minutes just to get to the front
Now I'm standing in long lines - lady with the baby
Probably buying some dog food, dog probably crazy
On a daily basis my days be like this
Cause I got to the register and then the store closed

[Chorus]
Yo what up man?!
If you cool what you do - warm it up then!
Can't hold it cause it's hot - put it down then!
I left my kids in daycare - pick em up then!
I'm tryna buy some new shit - what you tryna spend?
All I got is five dollars - so you broke man?
I thought I had ten dollars - so you broke then?
TV dinner on the counter - warm it up then!
Warm it up man! Warm it up then!

[Mikey Rocks]
Aiyyo come, get some, you little bums
I got a lot and you can't get none
That ice cream truck just left, if you run
you can catch - but it's out cause I got the last one
But I got a box of cones that I'm willing to sell
I'll sell the ice cream too, two scoops for a bill
I could build a sand castle without bringing a pail
And go catfish fishing and come up with a whale
But but you know what, that was easy as hell
Well maybe not the line about me catching a whale
But if I did it then it's nothing and I did it as well
Probably easy as it is to move slow for a snail
Did you know I made this beat with my mouth and a bell?
Just a F.Y.I., I'm F-L-Y
And for those that can't spell, I'm a pretty swell guy
I caught a lot of fish I think I'll have a fish fry

[Chorus]
Yo what up man?!
If you cool what you do - warm it up then!
Can't hold it cause it's hot - put it down then!
I left my kids in daycare - pick em up then!
I'm tryna buy some new shit - what you tryna spend?
All I got is five dollars - so you broke man?
I thought I had ten dollars - so you broke then?
TV dinner on the counter - warm it up then!
Warm it up man! Warm it up then!</pre>
