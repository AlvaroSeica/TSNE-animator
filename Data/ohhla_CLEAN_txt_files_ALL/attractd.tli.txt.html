Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[ANDY, JORMA, AND AKIVA]
White girls (You are attracted to us!)
Black girls (You are attracted to us!)
Asian girls (You are attracted to us!)
Latinas (You are attracted to us! Attracted to us!)

But you're never gonna get
Never, never gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it
Because we're shy
We're shy, we're shy
We're oh so shy
You're never gonna get it
'Cause we're sweet and shy (Hey!)

[BECK]
All you pretty girls
We know you want our bodies
Where are the introspective types? (Dah dah dah dah!)

[ANDY, JORMA, AND AKIVA]
[mumbling in French]
But you're never gonna get
Never, never gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it
Because we're shy
We're shy, we're shy
We're nice and shy
You're never gonna get it
We're blind and shy (Hey!)

Nerdy girls (You are attracted to us!)
Omigod girls (You are attracted to us!)
My hippy, dippy girls (You are attracted to us!)
J-j-j-jock girls (You are attracted to us!)
Space girls (You are attracted to us!)
In your face girls (You are attracted to us!)
(You are attracted to us!)
(You are attracted to us!)

[BECK]
'Cause we are shy</pre>
