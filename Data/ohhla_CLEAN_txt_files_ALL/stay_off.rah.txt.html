Song:   Stay Official
Typed by: Quest Rah

Connect minds across seas rep rhymes for lost keys
For shine we don't plead rock rhymes on real beats
official its the blueprint
official it's the movement
certified stamp ish
Like a Timb boot hit
artists be waste laced with
tools don't use it
charges sent thru
true do message music
haters still tun in
there thorn bush boomin
but their bud ain't bloomin
these steel bars zoom in
Feed the babies some words
So they can grow strong
I've walked the wastelands its time to move on
Architects keep it buildin' Wisdom for the children
don't stumble
still hustle
Sip tea n don't scuffle</pre>
