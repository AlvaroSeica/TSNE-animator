[Intro: Scratching and cutting]
Nigga, gotta keep my shit Real ----&gt; MC Ren

[MC Ren]
Remix, ugh, yeah
Putting down like this, like this..

[MC Ren]
You know I gotta keep it on, like light but I'm heavy
Nigga, tell your whore to stay away from the Chevy
I make you niggaz pray everyday like Bone
When you see me touch your motherfucking microphone
Straight out off the motherfucking streets of Compton like E
Make my first beat before adding on the emcee
White people hate me like Johny Cockern
Yelling Fuck The Police since niggaz been pop locking
I'm So So Def like Jermaine
You bitches wanna see me fuck it up, but can't take the pain
You niggaz bragging like Big Poppa
While you're living in the fucking hut like Jobba
Ugh, like Rick, I'm knocking niggaz out the box
I'll make your ass wanna have the big well like Great Fox
So fuck what you're going through
You whack niggaz this shit's for you
Keeps it real

[Chorus: MC Ren X2]
[Ren:] Now, how keeps it real?
[Rocc] You keeps it real
Ren in the cut, for real niggaz what
Niggaz out faking like they got skills
Rolling around with their rats in their floss mobiles
And that's real

[Hook: MC Ren]
Knock them out the box Ren
Knock them out the Ren
Knock them out the box Ren
Knock them out the Ren
Knock them out the box Ren
Knock them out the Ren
Knock them out the box Ren
Knock them out the Ren

[MC Ren]
Living room packed, laid back on the flow 
Fools can't see me on the live with a Lando
I'm running fools straight to the dirt
While my man Train talking on the phone the evil curt 
Niggaz waste gas driving down the same streets
And hood rats wishing for the passenger seats
Flag them down, like they're flagging down to get a taxi
Too good to ride a bus, drinking is a must
Another day kicking back, the Scientist is hard at work
Thinking how to get paid, kicking back in the shade
Or call Will and Temple where my homie down by Zeenie
With the bald head, it's too hot for the beanie
Sitting on the porch, niggaz run the stop sign
Hookers sell their bodies around the way ain't hard to find
Right in the corner of McDonald's Parking Lot
Peeping out their hair cause that spot is hot

[Chorus]

[Hook: MC Ren]

[Break: DJ Train Scratching Quote below]
Nigga, gotta keep my shit real ---&gt; MC Ren
Nigga, gotta keep my shit real ---&gt; MC Ren
Nigga, gotta keep my shit real ---&gt; MC Ren
Nigga, gotta keep my shit real ---&gt; MC Ren
Nigga, gotta keep my shit real ---&gt; MC Ren
Keep my shit real  ---&gt; MC Ren
 
[MC Ren]
Randy up the street cutting up the fresh paid
And Compton P.D. around the corner about to raid
The yellow Helicopter hanging around like a Gnat
And hood rats yelling out a car where the party at
While Robbin and Train go and get a deuce
And niggaz around the way don't give a fuck about a gang truce
But I gotta lot of love for my people
And like they ain't crying, niggaz just keep dying
I won't be like most niggaz and just come to shoot my video in Compton 
Then disappear for a year
We're making fools like that, shake the spot 
One for the treble, jack your ass in the Parking Lot
Cause handkerchief headed niggaz come around faking
Bragging about that money they be making
Boot licking, butt dancing, and niggaz just better chill
Before I tell them how I feel, and that's real

[Chorus]

[Hook: MC Ren]

Nigga, gotta keep my shit real ---&gt; MC Ren
Nigga, gotta keep my shit real ---&gt; MC Ren
Nigga, gotta keep my shit real ---&gt; MC Ren
Nigga, gotta keep my shit real ---&gt; MC Ren
Nigga, gotta keep my shit real ---&gt; MC Ren
Keep my shit real  ---&gt; MC Ren</pre>
