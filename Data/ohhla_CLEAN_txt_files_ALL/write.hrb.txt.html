Song:   Write Your Name
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Prelude]
Write your name across the sky (With talking prelude)

[Verse 1]
To all my fallen squad
write your name across the sky
while I flame 1 to the brain and go get high
and regardless of the pain I ain't gon cry
Cause I cant neva let a fuck nigga, see me stuck nigga
hustle hard for the bucks nigga, thats a must nigga
I done lost so many real niggas, I cant trust niggas
so I keep my distance from niggas
squad with me, bet I wont get touched nigga
Got shots for him, shots for him
niggas said fuck Rocblock, send shots at them
10 to 0 on the scoreboard, send shots again
keep goin non stop till we drop lots of men
And I swear I lost so many of my guys
so I'm sippin remy, smokin 50s for my guys
never let a nigga go on any of my guys, ain't nobody fuckin with No Limit in my eyes
Missin my niggas, Kushy and liquor, 4s of the lean
R.I.P. Richie, hand me a swisher
paint up a picture of me and the squad, still on the block before it was wrong
and Kobe was gon, and Joc was still home
Man I remember, now my heart is cold as December
gettin money is the only thing on my agenda
cause its too many gone, but I'm still livin on
stay strong for my farewells in this song

[Chorus]
Write your name across the sky (With talking prelude)

[Verse 2]
I'll give the money, fuck the fame, all the jewels
all the hoes, all the clothes and then all the shoes
just for my niggas back
but I know I'll never get em back
so if a pussy disrespect then he gettin wacked
And I heard niggas at my neck
Im like where they at
cause I be right there on the set with the biggest gatt
And so many niggas thats hatin, I don't even know em
And so many fellas, the hatred I don't even show em
Can I just get some money
cause I know niggas broke and bummy, that ain't even funny
I know they prolly wanna rob me, they hatin prolly
but they gon only make Marley come catch a body
they wont get nothing from me
From the hell hole, where its full of zombies
where they kill the most bodies across the country
where they took all of my homies from me
man R.I.P. my homies, gotta get this money
Squad
R.I.P. the L's, free the L's, all you niggas wanna be the L's
No Limit MB bitch we the L's
R.I.P. white folks, I cant see a L
Squad
And we gotta stay winning, rolling on fours with them semis and they tinted
pull up on the oppers, buss a beater and they hittin
cause we scored when we ain't have them heaters and they didn't, ah</pre>
