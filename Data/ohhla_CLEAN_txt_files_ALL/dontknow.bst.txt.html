Song:   I Don't Know
Typed by: blohm@u.arizona.edu

What's pleasing to the eye
In the delusion of my sight
Is not what I find when I reach into the light
I have lost my mind
I'm walking through time
Deluded as the next guy
Pretending and hoping to find
That distant peace of mind

Chorus:
I don't know
Who does know?
There is no-
Where to go

It's not so simple as I try to wish
But then again what is? 
There is no other worthy quest
So on I go

Chorus

I don't know
Who does know
Where to go?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

Well, that's about it...
