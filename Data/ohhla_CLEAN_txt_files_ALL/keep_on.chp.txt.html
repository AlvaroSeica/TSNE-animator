[Verse 1]
Yuh, ay kickdrums
Look ay bitch I'm from the slab
Ay strap on my lap I'm slidin down the block
I'm a get dough it ain't neva gon stop
Hoes see the chrome 4's and they follow, got my rims from the chrome big and tall sto
(Keep on pushin)
Pushin' what? candy cheverolet
Got a sweet tooth, I eat candy everyday
Pocket full of hundreds, I'm a run it where I stay
Bitch I'm from the slab, it can't be no other way
Up under my feet is where I stash that k
Get that half
Tryna get cash like ray
Hoes gon swang, and my trunk gon bang
Jollyrancher drippin' off the frame
(Keep on pushin)
Pushin what? candy golden cutless
Gotta about 10 12's makin' all that ruckus
I'm a let my trunk bump 'till I get a ticket
Candy paint look so delicious
Bitches just run up and lick it

[Chorus]
Dishin' out that work
When I when I chirp chirp
And that stain on my shirt
I'm a take them back to church
I'm I'm fresh fresh yes
Bitches go berserk
When they see me skirt
Kickdrum take em back to church

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Keep on pushin, we comin' down cap
Keep on pushin, ay we comin down cap

[Verse 2]
J's on my toes, nigga I'm thowed
TIS 24's hoggin' up the road
Gotta buncha speakas on my gold when I swang
Cappin on these hoes, purple diamonds in my rang
(Keep on pushin)
Pushin what? candy caprices
Paint flippin' I pull up they be like sweet Jesus
Smooth on my do'
When I swang I'm a glo'
Screens fallin' from the roof
Screens on the flo'
If you lookin for yo girlfriend, I got her
I'm a boss, Bill Gates owe me 20 dollars
Look who's cappin'
Money I been stackin'
Screens on my goddamn jacket
(Keep on pushin)
Pushin' what? candy Buick Regal
Yo girl in the backseat where it's see-thru
Slabs look at this
28's yeah we did it
Chevy so big, I'm livin' like a midget when I'm in it

[Chorus]
Dishin' out that work
When I when I chirp chirp
And that stain on my shirt
I'm a take them back to church
I'm I'm fresh fresh yes
Bitches go berserk
When they see me skirt
Kickdrum take em back to church

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Yup, yup ungh, yup yup
Keep on pushin, we comin' down cap
Keep on pushin, ay we comin down cap
