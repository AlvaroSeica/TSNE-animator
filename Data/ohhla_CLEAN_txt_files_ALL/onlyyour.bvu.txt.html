(chorus x2)
Life's dilemmas shake you up like the tremors from earthquakes
But remember do have faith don't forget what's at stake
Only your life
Tough decisions we gotta make

Coltrane bought a cold drink
Dr. Pepper I think but I really don't remember
Sat on the sofa watchin' Soul Train
Some singer was on looking like both genders
Speakin' of which, when Coltrane used cocaine
He would switch some of the time
Let grown men run in his behind
Anyway watchin' Tv at mama's house
Everything's fine
So ol' boy reclined but later on
He tried to reach over the table and change the channel
When he saw a picture that pissed him off
His Uncle Ty who made him soft grinnin' on the mantle
Damn hard to handle smashed it for the fourth time in ten years
As he fought back tears
Threw back beers and shots at the bar
Hopped in the car, killed all of the fear
By leavin' here
His father had his own issues, torment too
Thus the name, different thangs, but the same
One chose to bust his brain, other drove away
Their women remain in pain
(chorus)

Uncle Ty was a cool guy
You know, besides the way he treated trane, his nephew
Man, I was outta that, that's them
Met him back in the war, one of them cats that never left you
Stepped through all kinds of foreign lands
Cannons in hand, got back and got jack to show for it
Hot as hell hidin' in the forest
Supposed to be heroes they damn near ignore us
Pour us drinks though it's hard to pay, for 'em
Dirty uniform, slurrin' on the payphone
My wife goin' on and on, Ty laughed
Said a soulmate sho' ain't somethin' I'ma have
I hit the ave caught a cab as coltrane
Pulled up to pick up his unc, lookin' kinda mad
Said he had a little booze at the lily pad
Across the street so I nodded off to sleep to sweet thoughts
And I thought, all was cool, til' I woke
Up and heard, they fell off, in the street
Coltrane swerved, and I ask
Did Ty get what he deserved
