[ VERSE 1: Necro ]
Clap you in the beak with the snubnose heat
Wrap a towel round your head like a sheik to stop the blood leak
Slaughter your aorta, your heart forfeits
Hang you up, Colombian necktie, gore drips
Lay you out like Dexter, fag, it's my career
Dissect you in a Hefty bag, you'll disappear
A sarcastic, smart-ass punk
Now you're a carcass in my trunk, dropped in the garbage dump
Never to be seen again or heard of
The Godfathers method, efficient assembly line murder
Slice you with the machete like Iron Maiden Eddie
Then sit down, and eat meatballs and spaghetti
A new breed of New York thugs is born, yo
Ruthless, violent, greedy, drugs and porno
Roy DeMeo, pushin the boy and lleyo
Employ young boys to sling, the king lay low

[ CHORUS ]
Teflon Dons with the long-nose cronz
Blast through your Kevlar, plant car bombs
Untouchable, leave a bitch face split
We're like a second government, a dictatorship
Teflon Dons with the Revlon blondes
Got an army of serial killers and ex-cons
Untouchable, give you a facelift
We're like a second government, we dictate with clips

[ VERSE 2: Kool G Rap ]
Yeah, corporate money, gorgeous honeys
Tommy guns roar like the Roaring Twenties
G Corleone in a office with Sonny
Round magazine bullets lost in your tummy
Blaze your lights out, your lifestyle crumby
Keep running your mouth, you get found in a drum, B
Real life mobster shit, Red Lobster hits
Pop your shit with a box of clips
Head shots till your top is split
Best spot, nigga, red dot shit where they dock the ships
Blast off with a torch like Mad Dog Coll'n
Sawed-off double barrel, your backbone bulgin
Red stained white sheets where the target lay
Inside the barbershop, toast the Chardonnay
You get done in the harshest way
Joey Zasa style, catch 'em in the crowd at the marching parade
Okay?

[ CHORUS ]
