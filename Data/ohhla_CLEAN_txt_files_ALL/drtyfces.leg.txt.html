Angels with dirty faces

We got this underground
We got this underground
We got this new sound
Alright, check it

[CHORUS] X 2
We are there
Riding the scene
The world
Goes on
Without you

Sun-shh for Sunspot Jonz
Underground legend bones
Almost broke trying build this underground heaven
We are lights of a passage
Be alert
Be about work
And penetrate while others hate
Yo, they instigate
We translate
Verbal codes into lyrical states
Can't wait
For that phone call
I'm calling you
What can you do for me
And the Legendary?
We must sell this CD
And make it back
Those who lack
Your mental
Will always hold your back
I grew up up in Oakland
Next to High Street
Yo, my feet are my eyes and my ears are my moves
Bumpin' like this groove
We choose to the rhythm
We choose to the rhythm
We move to the rhythm
Yeah, and it don't stop
'Cause the world don't stop
What you gonna do, draw?

[CHORUS] X 2
[Never, never stop] [Put 'em up, put 'em up]

B-b-b-beauty like a woman's touch
There's still so m-m-m-m-much to learn
A kiss is a b-b-b-b-burn
Into my soul
We know nothing
But we see it all
This is all not the same
I am a warrior
On the mic you can't strike
Yo, you better swing all the way
And bring home the pendant
Yo, I didn't have all "A"s in school
But I could see the way
Fuck being average
I knew the world was run by cabbage, green
Can't have owed
Dream with the fishes
We make wishes
Ain't nothing ever gonna go
Unless you go and just show oh so-so
Ain't nothing ever gonna go
Ain't nothing ever gonna change
Unless you go and use your soul
Use your mind [We ridin' the scene and we gonna ]
Know your role, know your role, know your role

[CHORUS] X 4
[Yeah, the world go on without you, now]
[The scene] [Yeah, it go on without you]
[Yeah, the world go on without you, now]
[The scene] [Yeah, it go on without you]

You always thought stuff was gonna stay the same
You always thought you could just make and maintain
The world go on without you, you never know

We are 

Somethin' to end out on
Let the music just fade out
Then you can just close your eyes
And just think about  </pre>
