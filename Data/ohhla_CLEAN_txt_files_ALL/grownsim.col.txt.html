[Verse 1]
Now I was dreamin' bout a deal at the age of thirteen
I was fiendin' for the meals; I ain't talking Burger King
Some of my niggas in the Ville all they did was serve fiends
Fuck scales, I had skills: all day rehearsing
Them pretty boys had them gals, spend their time flirting
All they wanted was some waves like they fucking surfing
Hold up now don't get it twisted, I ain't hatin', do your thing
I was like a young Simba: couldn't wait to be the king
Now, nigga, it's the prince
Hopped over the fence, where the grass way greener
Look at shorty ass way meaner
Something like Serena mixed with Trina, have you seen her
She fine enough to be Miss Howard, word to Adina
My money like a senior watch it graduate
Now its time to eat I'm letting all my niggas grab a plate
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies
These niggas heard about me now they acting like they know me

[Refrain]
Where you goin' nigga
Shit, there ain't no telling
Ay, where you goin' nigga
Ay, there ain't no telling
They keep on saying where you goin' nigga
There ain't no telling
Can't tell you where I'm goin', just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the top

[Verse 2]
Pardon the interruption
A proper introduction is necessary when your shit is legendary, man
Greedy niggas wouldn't let me in the cafeteria
Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian
The hoes is librarians, they looking me up
She got a jones like Marion, she licking me up
Then we cut, look how she say my name
I got her moaning J. Cole, they used to say Jermaine
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin, 6 feet, shit's deep
I was low, just a dolla and some hope fixed me
Cause I was broke plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser
Lord, please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer
I'm a star, Converses
Conversing with them girls with them curves like cursive
They open like curtains because my shit is unheard of
Like curses on the radio
Same bitches used to play me though

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
I left the city for a minute but it's still on my back
Told my niggas, "Ay I'm finna' put the Ville on the map"
I'll be back, and I'm coming with a deal and a plaque
Cause I'm ill bitch, they couldn't make a pill for the rap
Pouring liquor for my niggas that was killed, send em back
Came home shit is real niggas still in the trap
Hold up now don't get it twisted if you slang do your thang
Me I'm like a young Simba I can't wait to be the king
Witness the dream
Straight out that Carolina water I was brought up
In the city where the skinny niggas tryna be the ballas
Ain't no fathers but the skinny niggas tryna hit their daughters
Sneaking in her crib but her momma never caught us
What they taught us men them bad bitches only want the ballas
The starters, we hoopin' now the hoes wanna guard us
Okay, so play D - know what I mean?
And I put you on the team
Man this life is but a dream
And I need a fast car, bad broads, fast forward
Passports: I'm a fucking rap star</pre>
