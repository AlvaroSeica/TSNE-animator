(Girl talking Spanish)

How come you always trippin

I see you like that, the way I call your name
When I tell you shit is real you know it ain't a game
No pretending, always breakin up and mending
We gon' kill each other before this shit we got is ending
Yea you like that, when I pull up on them dubs
And everytime playas see me all I get is love
Hugs and kisses from all my little bitches
They give you much respect cause they know you the misses
Yea you like that, in the mall spending chips
Nothin but Gucci and Donna Karen on your hips
Smile on your lips while I'm kissin on your titty nips
Watch the sunrise, smoke a blunt and take a skinny dip

At first I be's with you
Started pleasin you
Whole world you never knew
You'd ever see LIKE DAT

Your personality
And sexuality
Will keep you right next to me
For eternity LIKE DAT

Yea you like that, a real nigga on your team
No schemes, and it ain't all about a niggas cream
Where dreams and all kinds of freaky little things
Always in public trying to make a big scene
You you like that, think you hard as a statue
Keep running your mouth until you make a nigga snatch you
Look at you, how a nigga like me attract you
Mack you, then attack the gat too
Yea you like that, give it to me anywhere
Five skully in the movie theater pullin on your hair
I'm aware, your girls say I'm nothing but a dog
They mad cause I give you all that shit you say you want
I know you like that, and thats the way its gon' be
Haters bumpin always got to say some fly shit see
Shorty down we don't worry bout he say drama
I'm gon' be your big poppa and you gon' be my lil' momma

(Girl talking Spanish)

(Chorus)

I know you like that flippin through the city at night
Lightin 'dro gettin tight tropical on ice
Who the realest in your life I know the answer to that
The same nigga spittin this and as a matter of fact
Remember back when we first met, incredible sex
Sometimes edible sex and unforgettable sex
Ice on your finger, not for marriage or nothing
You the shit when it come to pushin all my buttons
Yea you like that, time out take a trip
Fuck a reservation grab your coat and just dip
No alarm clock, sleeping all afternoon
Shrimps and steak without leaving the room
I know you like that even when your ass get mad
Forehead wrinklin', thinkin' you could beat my ass
Baby girl, slow your role, just let it go
And we ain't got to talk about that shit no more

(Girl talking Spanish)

(Chorus)
