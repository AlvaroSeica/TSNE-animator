[Scratching]

Behold the fungus among us
When dabblin with babblin
I sends the battle scene to the apocalypse
With this you grab my cock ya lips 
Be gettin sorta puckery
Gettin the Brewin gassed to save that ass come stop the fuckery
My style'll leave ya posin like a hitch hiker
Make me wanna bitch microphone slap that shady ass, you bullshit nigga
Your frontin said you didn't think too hot of me
But once you feel the vocal sodomy you'll say, "You got it, G"
I finds the virgin ears I'm bustin raw pops
Ya savin the drops, tryin to analyze my DNA, the verbal blueprint
Even if you spend eternity you're baffled, nigga
Havin not the slightest clue of how I'm swingin
Bringin styles and flow that's nastier than urine
See my shit is pure and ghetto embellished demonic funk and all that good shit
A bad nigga when it comes to grabbin mics
I love all women of the spectrum, fuck around I'm stabbin dykes
And as I hurt em I convert em, when it comes to honey dip skits 
I'm leavin pussies sore as if you just delivered triplets, I flip shit 
When niggas say the brewin doesn't rhyme slick 
I yokes em in the Heimlich just to get the fuckin garbage out ya throat 
Mentally hardcore 
There be no guard for defendin against the shit I'm sendin 
Once you're comprehendin the ill funk aphrodisiac 
Givin the hoodies woodies as I'm fuckin up the head like brass knuckles givin noogies

[Scratching, horns]

I be's the hell fire word reaver 
Even Ripley can't believe 
I pull a stunt as if my name was Colt Seaver 
AKA The Fall Guy
I never score, why?
I'm hittin like Mattingly
Get your fuckin Webster's dictionary 
Look under "fat" and you'll see my profile so smile 
You're grinnin like the Joker
Cause I chose to smoke a mic and let you witness 
Get this through your thick skull: my shit is deadly 
I kicks my verse, niggas couldn't offer competition with a medley of their works
I smirks when booty niggas try and grab this 
Survival of the fittest call me fuckin Tony Atlas, at the podium 
I pours my sodium in open flesh wounds as I mesh tunes with the vocal joint 
To become the focal point
Brothas of funk soon discover I be +deeper+ than that nigga Larry Fishburne's +cover+
Hover on the L, sorta like a stealth in the night
Then I makes the party +jump+ even when it's full of +white men+ 

[Scratching, horns]

Check it out
I represent enlightenment 
That have you squintin 
Hintin to rewards of the lord's charity received with clarity 
I heave skillaful syllable is the brick I stick in music mortar 
Makin ya think and raisin my floor to architect

I comes to spark a teck
Mind barrages massages carressed in peace 
The vocal acupuncture your stress released 
Like a hymen crack in my rhymin slack and never that 
Styles mysterious like under LL's hat

The curious become the furious and play the jury
Thus I'm found guilty labelin my sound filthy with the gutter in my utter 
A fat bitch goes, "Me me me" 
I cut her in pieces kill her sisters daughters and nieces 
Anything related to such a thought 
I crush I fought hard representin wicked Juggaknot minds 
I breaks it down to your English
I makes you say, "I'm gooder" 
Verbs deeper than a hooker strictly bonin seven footers
