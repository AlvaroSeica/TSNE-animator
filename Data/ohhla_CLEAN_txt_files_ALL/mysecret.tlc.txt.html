Now I lay me down to sleep
That was then, but this is now
I pray the lord my soul to keep 
I let you slip away somehow
If I should die before I wake 
If I should die my pain shall stay
I pray the lord my soul to take
I made you what you are today

Now as I look at myself I'm seein' someone familiar 
Starin' back at me through every deep crack that's in my mirror 
And as I think to myself 
I'm hearin somebody else scream at me (shhh....)
I no longer hear from 
Could it be the unknown 
Sneaking into my zone 
Off we roam 
My spirituals is not alone
I'm visualizing this invisible clone 
It's my own 
And it's own 
Rest assured it's my dome 
Maybe I need to go to bed 
Could have sworn I just heard that voice up in my head 
Nots while I raps 
When it hits me (ha ha ha ha....) 
But now it's laughin at me
Yo, what the hell is happenin?
Please somebody slap me 
No way, not another physical display 
Somethin' must got me backin' up from way back in the day 
But what can it be 
I can't recall the memories so if I may ask...

I just seen you yesterday 
It's my fuckin' past 
I just seen you yesterday 
It's my fuckin' past 
I just seen you yesterday 
It's my fuckin' past 
I just seen you yesterday 
It's my fuckin' past 
I just seen you yesterday 
It's my fuckin' past 
I just seen you yesterday 
It's my fuckin' past 
I just seen you yesterday 
It's my fuckin' past 
I just seen you yesterday

By any means was all it ever seemed to be 
This reminiscin' with my past has got me 
Caught up in a daydream 
Stay in bed with niggas who can pay the rent 
Spending my green on panty hose and tight jeans 
I used to be so amused 
Cuz the tools that I used to break rules 
Only seemed to confuse as to whose bein' abused 
Place yourself in my shoes 
My blessed look of innocence was never refused

Now that I choose to abide 
Hello Left Eye 
And put my past to the side 
I don't guess I...
And kill a piece of my pride 
...Need to introduce myself
You already said hi 
Oh, so you're the match that lights my fuse 
I'm used 
Huh, I thought I left you on on that cruise 
You lose it 
Your man took 
My place when he threw me in your face 
So we drank up all the booze

Sing the blues 
And yo, we end up on the news 
Sing the blues 
We end up on the news 
Sing the blues 
We end up on the news 
Sing the blues 
I said we end up on the news 
Sing the blues 
We end up on the news 
Sing the blues 
And yo we end up on the news 
Sing the blues 
We end up on the news 
Sing the blues 
We end up on the news

Gotta get away from the past 
If I make it I just might last 
Gotta get away from the past 
Tryna escape it but it's movin' too fast 

Gotta get away from the past 
If I make it I just might last 
Gotta get away from the past 
Tryna escape it but it's movin' too fast. 

We was walkin' before most babies could crawl 
Yes yes y'all 
Above all one foot tall 
Ain't no way I'm takin' a down fall 
I'm restructurin' walls 
Interruptin' your calls 
And goin' straight to the source 
With this nut in my balls 
Every time the blind lead the blind 
Another one of my kind's outta sight and outta mind 
I'm comin' through the press 
With this sense you can't mess 
I'm sittin' in your dreams 
Go ahead, take a rest 
I'm poppin' off your nigga's chest 
Should I be in distress? 
And niggas poppin' on the scene 
And they can get these 
That's my bitch 
I'm his bitch 
What the hell do they know? 
Is that so? 
They say they case scenario 
And I could care less 
About your people and their relentlessness 
Towards the eye 
Say good-bye 

And tell his moms to stop cryin' 
Go tell his moms to stop cryin' 
His moms to stop cryin' 
Go tell his moms to stop cryin'
