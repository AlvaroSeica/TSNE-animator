[Intro: sample]
"There he is, there he is, pal
In a cell, with a gorilla
With a psycho gorilla"

[Shawn Wigs]
I'm a gorilla, I beast out forty five tracks
Bench screen the dime, then crunch up my six packs
Big stacks, watch me get money, on the kick back
Icky bags of weed, we only blow big sacks
Big backs, walk through the crowd like whatever
Ya'll bullets can't hurt me, I bulletproof the leather
And duck like duck season, I got a rhyme for reason
Smoke the blunts til my lungs is wheezing
And tear back beats til my lips is numb
I'm just, one of the kings from the 45 kingdom
Palace, grip mics til my hands is calyst
Rough like the Brock, built like Fort Knox
Had two nines, way before the cops had glocks, so
Show me my respect, verbally I eat 'em
I'm never gonna join 'em, watch the way I beat 'em</pre>
