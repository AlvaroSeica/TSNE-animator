[Intro: Random] + (Lefty)
Yooo~! (What's crackin?)
What's good man? How you been?
(It ain't lookin good right now bruh)
What'chu mean man? It's Christmas time
The most joyous time of the year
(Man, you don't even know)

[Lefty]
Christmas only two days awayyy
Gotta get these gifts so that my daughter don't be angry at me
Fisher-Price bike, plus I wanted to get her some leigh
Gotta her them shoes, gotta get her that dress, plus I know she wanted a sleigh
My money looking funny cause my job cut 36 hours
out of the budget what a significant problem
Never wait 'til the last minute to try to do all your shopping
Cause you will lose all yo' options (options)

[Random]
That's word! Just another day sittin on
the stoop like we do when the kids is bored
Thinkin 'bout the Christmas list I wrote
And wishin I could ask for a lil' bit more
Gotta make this money mayne
And I ain't got nothin against Santa Claus
But last year he fronted, didn't bring what I wanted
And I ain't tryin to take another loss (naw)
Just as the snow starts to fall
Blanketing my community
Most people see it as hinderance
but in this I saw ppportunity
Grab my scully and my shovel and plus my mittens too
No time for frontin or nothin, we on a mission dude!

[Chrosu]
Christmas time is comin and we gotta make them ends meet
Wrote a letter to Santa but just in case he miss me
Grab your shovel clear the block we split it 50/50
Easy money, tell me is you wit me? (Let's get this cheese!)

[Lefty]
Look up in the sky! Snow is comin rapidly
Astonished and surprised, now it's time to get this cash you see
Everytime it snow around here that mean cash for me
Shovel all the houses from Christian all the way to Catherine Street
Homeboy hey I'ma get it my way
I'm tryin to touch more cash than the till on Black Friday
I'm heavy up on my grind mayne
Cause Christmas' one day away and I still gotta get more presents mayne

[Random]
Word~! We hit the block with purpose, the old ladies is nervous
But we far from the hoodlums, you've seen us up in service
And we don't mean any harm, there's no need for alarm
The nicest places we scraping until the snow is gone
But singin while we shoveling, nah I may not love it man
But I need a pair of shoes and bike and we ain't got another plan
Make a path and make it fast, grab the rock salt make it last
Snow is fallin ain't you glad? Now it's time to make some cash

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Lefty]
Let's get this cheese!
Let's get this cheese!</pre>
