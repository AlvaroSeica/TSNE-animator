[Darkim Be Allah]
Shots rang out, at the bistro
Kissed the ring, call me Feasto
Heading to the west, from the east, low, he so gangsta
I be the hitman, in the bank in Lanka
Get shit started like Sanka, swallowing drop nines
Or wives like Solomon, New York like Sodom
And Gommorah, my dunns wild out from the horrors
Study Bibles, read Qu'ran's and they Torrahs
Supreme science came to the times, bring the violent
Middle of the street, heat firing, I smash microphones quick
My dome sick, keep a bone lit, drop fast
The last two opponents, couragious and bust shots
And three sixty radius, I drop dummies, got moneys with the craziest...
Po' search but they ain't finding me
I caught this case in '93, cats could finally
Place this face, cuz you reminding me like Mary
A nigga got juks and still family, don't walk near me
Son I don't walk on the block, it's still risky
Niggas is mad like Bill Bixby, the shocker
Alias cloak of Peter Parker, Christ the magnificent
The most merciful and most beneficent
Niggas caught beef over differences, I slay them
The album caught a triple X rating, bust nuts inside a maiden
I'm banned for life because I blown shit, snatch the mic
Just like I own shit, a man, on some grown shit
The hands hit the chrome spit, the back, get ya dome lit
Never play with this microphone shit

[Chorus: Supreme Just]
If you a phony making records, just writing rhymes
Stop wasting your time, you wasting your time
Drop seed, make root, root hold tree
Tree elevate the underground degree

[AllahWise]
Got to express my views, point of views, interviews
I'm the winner you choose, made it hard to lose
Spot me like flashy jewels, fly suit
Fancy shoes, hat matching new fresh, style of rapping
Actor like Samuel Jackson, the new Shaft
Niggas making me laugh, don't know today's math
With negative ways of getting cash, black ski mask
Over the face, run in the place, gun in your face, empty the safe
No time to waste, fuck a cop case, we busting at jakes
Foot off the breaks, I skate crack through the gates
Should of knew them was snakes, trynna play ball
Now ya'll take a fall, before of taking it all
Now the enlarge amount, no doubt
Spit it out like diamonds in my mouth, that's what it's all about
The back route, before I go in, leave the doors open
D's on the roofs scoping, we got to screws the day approaching
Yeah, my shit is potent like weed smoking
Blowing like high explosion, keep ya eyes open
Wider than the ocean, now I see it in slow motion
Cock back the hammer, black shots through the grammar
In front of the camera, mic slammer, still tying it up
Like a bandana, pants saggy like wet vampa
Wear it like dirty clothes in the hamper
You can't damper, you fucking with a grandmaster
Wise wit it, coming down like ice blizzard
Niggas know I'm nice wit it, put it right in your fitted

[Chorus]</pre>
