Chorus:2x 
Hoes off 
Hoes on, street flooded 
Hoes off 
We done, left ya hood leaded 
Hoes off 
Hoes on, street flooded 
Hoes off 
{1st time thru} We one, left ya hood leaded 
{2nd time thru} But we done, left ya hood leaded 

Verse 1: 
As I creeps off 
To cool these Hot Boys off 
I reach new levels 
I be goin against the devils 
I knew it was four 
They recruited some mo' 
I run up my squad 
Fireproof head-to-toe 
I went lookin for these boys, I hit every block 
Checked every rehab, hit every dope spot 
I came up wit nuthin 
Then I heard somethin 
On the radio, I go to V.L. cuz they be stuntin 
Block hardy Hot Boys 
No you're not boys 
Wet Boys on their way with their supersoaker toys 
Got a pack on my back holdin 75 gallons 
32 round glock loaded with the black (?) 
First HB I saw, Baby suckin gold teeth 
Supersoaked em good, from his head to his feet 
Next up was Juvey, I gave him the look 
Wrote the final chapter, then I closed the book 
Ran up on Turk 
Supersoaker puttin in work 
Jacked him out his 42 dollar rent, cooled off his Hot Boy shirt 
Next two, BG and Wayne, since they wanna be the baddest 
Shot em up wit bad dope, to me that's the saddest 
Look 

Chorus:2x 

[T-Bone] 
Verse 2: 
Well it's T-Beezy 
Off the heezy 
Bout that drama fo' sheezy 
Supersoaker in my trunk, how many Hot Boys wanna see me 
Chromed out five trucks with chrome K's to match 
Bulletproof-fire suits, I'm totin gallons on my back 
Ready to spray 
I'm rainin on your sunny day 
I get carried away 
Like Dirty Hairy "Make my day!" 
Betta yet, fuck dat, Wet Boys got me on a flight 
Since you don' made my day, what bitch gon' make my night 
Wanna go for a ride 
While the water's low tide 
It's nowhere to hide 
I hit ya wit a (?) 
Who be the coldest nigga makin these tracks 
The same nigga made niggas quit and start smokin crack 
I should be slammin 
Niggas out there be jammin 
All tracks real dope, ain't no mutha fuckin whammin 

Verse 3: 
Fire tracks and fire trucks 
Nigga duck 
Still get plucked 
Hit you wit a supersoaker I'ma paralize ya to fuck 
250 pounds of pressure 
? gone dress ya 
Now you one nigga less-a 
For bein a Wet Boy testa 
If I come thru with a fire truck nigga hate to hear the siren 
Water for us, ya gettin ?, so I'm holdin my hydrent 

Chorus:4x 

Verse 4: 
So you say you wanna get him, erase my face and 
Put a price on my head, betta get a new plan 
Cuz all that price on my head, ya plan gon' fail 
I flip the script 
Take my own hit, now your shit gonna sale 
No say "I can't get got" 
Cuz souljas get got alot 
But if they hit, you say miss 
I be the new mailman on your block 
Ain't no mail in my bag 
Look it's 'caine and soulja rags 
Your first on my ojenda, gotta return the (?) 
I stand in your driveway, supersoakers on 
Pressure wash your property till my waters all gone 
I ain't no joke wit mine, I don't choke my nigga 
I got a scope on mine, you get smoked my nigga 
The rap game I been runnin 
Just for funn 'n 
Look my uzi weighs a ton 'n 
'45 Tommy gunnin 
Ya get done 'n 
You and your son'n 
That's what ya call me nigga 
Fire trucks comin thru, betta get the army nigga 
Ya bawlin nigga, I stand tall wit my ground 
Not just represent Up, but also Downtown 
Here's what I wanna do, here's how I'm gonna do it 
Wet Boys gotta plot, peep game and listen to it 

Chorus: 4x
