"I-I-I ain't scared of nothin!" - Richard Pryor

[Chorus One 2X: Somaya Reese]
Wild out, this is it, blast your shit, lunatics
You ain't scared, go ahead - put your put your hands high (get 'em!)

[Chorus Two 2X: Chino XL]
My only weakness is - I ain't scared of nothin
My only weakness is - I ain't scared of nothin~!

[Chino XL]
Yo... that nigga Chino XL is a cold menace
That ain't scared of nothin like I got no nerve endings
With the sickest sentence that is known from here to Venice
since Rick Rubin signed my demo, been stronger than wooly mammoths
Heart darker than Black Sabbath
A real master of words that causes +Havoc+ like Prodigy's partner's parents
Syllable chemist, was 16 with my first 12-inch
Destined, I had no choice like an arranged marriage
Like an inbred, tie you up in a toolshed
Hang you upside-down and beat you 'til your piss turns red
Make you an invalid, yes I'm sick and into it
It makes my heart warm like hatin my father when I was a kid
No savin grace, I'm usin razor blades to slash your arms
You're left for days and ate by gators in the Everglades swamps
I ain't scared of nothin, I'm stubborn, a live wire
My name in sign language is a middle finger on fire

[Chorus Two] + [Chorus One]

[Chino XL]
I'm that brolic god of carnage that would body college
Sick as gynecologists, spit collagen at live piranhas
Eat cyanide olives by a cottage in the farthest forest
Burnin down a farmer's crops just when he was about to harvest
My vocal cords will murder yours from sheer power wattage
Your comments, "Why did the plague of Chino rain down upon us?"
Silence, I'm breakin your legs, you're nauseous
You can't run again like a president that already served two terms in office
Livin lawless, raw performance for the riches
Put you down like toilet seats when you live in a house full of bitches
Sicker than Caeser's syphilis and JonBen√©t Ramsey's killers
and pictures of Natalee Holloway's titties, can I get a witness?
My spirit is big so I don't fear a thing
I'll karate kick Steven Seagal in his lace front wig - fuck a pig!
Hop out the whip and shatter your ribs
Wearin a mask in broad day like Michael Jackson's kids did
And I'll flip and then whip you to death with a marble barstool
And dig up your corpse so I can drive in a lane for the carpool
How do you think you can threaten the metaphor weapon
that's responsible for inventin this industry's rebellion?
Hellion, dark scoundrel, me fearin someone?
Over my dead body nigga, Gary Coleman

[Chorus Two] + [Chorus One]

{"I-I-I ain't scared of nothin!"}

[Chino XL]
Lungs of a champion, I'll take one breath and I start an album 
and don't breathe again 'til I'm sittin at masterin
Chino the ambassador castin the spell of a massacre
Hell is the task of the assassin that does more spazzin per capita
Servin half of the bastard rappers, inhalin cancer
Breathe out asthma, dump your body in the back of a factory canister
My position is vivid, if it's a gimmick
I'll give it 60 minutes then exhibit the sickest village verbal spillage
Worship my words, I got more game than wildlife preserves
I'm purgin out sperm in a perma' perm in a groupie bird
I stand firm in the stance that Chino XL is the handsomest
No time for romancin shit, I'm on my Charles Manson shit
I got so many bars that I could apply for a liquor license
Not the lesbian type that's dyking but viking trips I'm writin
where my similies are similar and liken to a Lycan
Werewolf in the night that'll have you and your trife afterlife unitin
I'm fightin, managin, keepin savage at all costs
Fuck showers, I'm draggin Mark Zimmerman through a car wash
I rhyme to the point of exhaust and killin everybody
And copied 16 and sloppy and played out like Ed Hardy
You started I'm slashin, I don't wanna hear you're sorry
Leave your face fractured, twisted backward like Whitney's baby's daddy Bobby
I'm the illest is what the gossip is
Wanna rep your state? Aight, I'll beat you into the state of unconsciousness
Monsterous 'til I'm posthumous, it's obvious
Me fearin anybody breathin, simply nonsense

[Chorus Two]
