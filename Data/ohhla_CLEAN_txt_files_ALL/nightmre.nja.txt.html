[Verse 1]
Death is the gate of life, crept when it's late
At night, heinous fright a threat with the blade of knife
The razor slice, blood is spilled
The raider strikes, you're hunted, killed			
Destructive wrath and no one is spared
You're crushed and smashed the lone gun appears			
Foes run in fear, I ward off squad
Foes unprepared and caught off guard			
You wither in pain, disfigured and maimed
I'm drilling  your brain, the ninja's insane 			
The victor will reign, witness the sick 
And derranged, vicious it's simple and plain			
Assault and trauma you're caught in the vault 
Of horror, I'm morbid the horrid  monster 			
Give ya the shivers, I'm bitter, heartless
Ninja will injure the prince of darkness			

[Verse 2]
You're guided to the crossroads, you died and then your corpse's cold
My force grows, deciphering the morse code			
Night is grim, silent when in stalk mode
Violent winds, frightening and aweful				
Nicest with the crossbow, arrows fierce
Timeless scripts will haunt foes, battle's fierce					
Shadows scares, lone will beleaguer
Have no cares, stoic demeanor					
Pyschopath, I'm a bit disturbed
Rifle blast, got a twisted nerve				
At last the surprise comes, your trapped 
In asylum, you're thrashed as you try to run		
A nightmare from the start to end
I strike fear in the hearts of men				
I didn't fight fair and it's callous hate
A living nightmare that you can't escape</pre>
