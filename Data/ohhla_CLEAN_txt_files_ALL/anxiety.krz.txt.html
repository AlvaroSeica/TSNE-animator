Who you really think is
watchin while you sleepin?
Why wont you believe in... me...me..
What you think is makin me
anxious ain't just satan we
oh shit, pray to God, and be free...free

ANXIETY!
It freaks me out
IT'S DRIVIN ME!
It creeps me out
INSIDE OF ME!
Can't keep me out
I'M GOING! GOING! GONE! GONE!
ANXIETY!
It freaks me out
IT'S DRIVIN ME!
It creeps me out
INSIDE OF ME!
Can't keep me out
I'M GOING! GOING! GONE! GONE!

When I'm alone in my room, sometime I stare at the wall
In the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call
Tellin me I need a gun, just in case of a brawl
I can block em, block em all
Shoot em up till them fall
Something fucked up going on inside of me
Can't believe the hold it's got on me, it's gotta be
temporary, cause this shit I'm feel is very scary
I think  little pills is necessary
Cause I can't tell what I am any more, an animal, from Amittyville
be a man and take a stand and he will
Do something bout it.. Cause often I'm thinkin bout offin me
Yellin to the coffin but hell is gonna be costin me
Cause of the crazy crazy world, and this crazy girl
that I'm made this way, this way I'm gon stay
In limbo, limbo now. How low can you go?
Paranoid, sleeping with my gun, now I think you know it's

ANXIETY!
It freaks me out
IT'S DRIVIN ME!
It creeps me out
INSIDE OF ME!
Can't keep me out
I'M GOING! GOING! GONE! GONE!
ANXIETY!
It freaks me out
IT'S DRIVIN ME!
It creeps me out
INSIDE OF ME!
Can't keep me out
I'M GOING! GOING! GONE! GONE!

I feel like a fuckin maniac in public..
I feel like a fuckin maniac in public..
I feel like a fuckin maniac in public..
If you creep up in Krizz house, yo ass ain't gon be walking out

Who you really think is
watchin while you sleepin?
Why wont you believe in... me...me..
What you think is makin me
anxious ain't just satan we
oh shit, pray to God, and be free...free

Psycho, miko, schizo, get yo fits
Too many hits to make you slit your wrists
Give me three and balance me till he challenge me, sort of iffy
Somethings really wrong with the son of your uncle ippy
So who did this to me? If you got more to give, then give it to me
This blue balloon is like a prison to me
Cause I can't sit with my back to the door no more
Give me a minute in the place and I'm packin the five after the four
Kinda like how I do it in his face
You can not wake me up without waking me up swinging, swinging
I'm livin livin, my dreams are so vivid, what's the meaning?
This world ain't safe for my seed, ain't a place for my species
The heebies, the jeebies, is giving me

ANXIETY!
It freaks me out
IT'S DRIVIN ME!
It creeps me out
INSIDE OF ME!
Can't keep me out
I'M GOING! GOING! GONE! GONE!
ANXIETY!
It freaks me out
IT'S DRIVIN ME!
It creeps me out
INSIDE OF ME!
Can't keep me out
I'M GOING! GOING! GONE! GONE!

I feel like a fuckin maniac in public..
I feel like a fuckin maniac in public..
I feel like a fuckin maniac in public..
If you creep up in Krizz house, yo ass ain't gon be walking out</pre>
