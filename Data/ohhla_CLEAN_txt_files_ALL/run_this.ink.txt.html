Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Run [13x]
Run this shit
Run Run this
Shit you know I
Run [13x]
Run this shit
Run run this shit

You don't want nothing with this
Not only do I run but I lunge this shit
Smoke like I don't need lungs and shit
Spit lit like two rubbing sticks
Wipe me down
Betta call charmin
Cuff yo chick
Kiss so charming
Ima make my way in marlin
Hit it and she gon come back, karma
Its murda betta call the corner
They ain't wanna let me in they circle so I corner
When I'm done baby you can go put a fork in em
Don't talk money then you sound like a foreigner
In my lime light I'm the sun of you
Any list I'm the one and number two
No rest room up all night check the bottom of my shoe I don't walk I..

Run [8x] I got em
Run [4x] you know I
Run run this shit
Run [8x] I got em
Run [4x] you know I
Run run this shit

I say what I want no censored
Paper getting real long like a center
To the money soon as I enter
We know you ain't gettin paid interns
Being fly as a preset
Everything on froze, reset
You can't fuck with me
You just sell a bit
So many hoes, mothafucker I could sell a bitch
Sick fever, right inside da hits sweep the beat like Tila
Member when I used to work on scales like libras
Rap now but I'm still duckin the zebras
You cant ever pass me
Go and just face it
Ridin that beat like a motherfucka base hit
I don't give a fuck who you run with
I know they know who (run this shit)

Run [8x] I got em
Run [4x] you know I run this shit
Run run this shit
Run [8x] I got em
Run [4x] you know I run this shit
Run run this shit</pre>
