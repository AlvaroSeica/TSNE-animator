A tape in a green case
It was a tape in a green case
Run-D.M.C., it was a tape in a green case
Remember that?

It was a tape in a green case
that ultimately rearranged my fate
Changed the face, engraved some pace
Opened up the place that I live in
Back then, to most kids rap music was forbidden
But through my brother, I was given
mixtape after mixtape of emcees spitting
I was driven by the writtens they were kicking
and visioned myself too with a mic one day
In one way, or maybe many, many more
I had plenty of topics to explore, never that sure
But endeavoured to ignore the sore putdowns
I wouldn't be pushed around by these clowns
quick to diss it, as far as I was concerned
as soon as I turned they could kiss it
It was a beautiful biscuit not to be bitten
A risk but I ripped it, a gift I was given
A dream, so I wished it
And if it develops the way that it is
future kids may just be able to live with this as their biz
And I look forward to this day, this day

[Chorus X2]
Keep pushing, we'll keep moving
Put your foot in, feel the movement
We kept doing it, improvements
They kept looking at me through into this almighty music

[Muph]
The first tracks were as wack as the next emcee
But effort and persistent attacks bring out the best in me
Exceptionally passionate about the immaculate entities
Recipes for leisurely chemistry
Beats and a mic and I'm like "I'm gonna start repping me"
This will forever be affecting these dilemmas
and when it's all over, the music will help me to remember
that December when the sun was shining so bright
The warm nights and the dimmed lights
The hours I recite to make the show tight
It may be out of sight, but it's not out of my mind
I'm gonna keep on the grind 'til I'm reaching my prime
That divine feeling of achievement
I'll record it and then I'll leave it
I'll keep it like your secrets
and then release it with the sweetest of relief

[Chorus X2]
