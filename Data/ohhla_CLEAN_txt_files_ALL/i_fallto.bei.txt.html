Song:   I Fall to Pieces
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah Yeah
Ah, ah,
Yeah, yeah

Baby when you're gone my whole world feels wrong
I don't know what to do.
When ya leave my side, it just don't feel right
When I'm away from you
I fall to pieces (Way-Oh)
I fall to pieces (Way-Oh)
I fall to pieces (Way-Oh)
Without you, without you..

To be alone is a curse
girl there is nothing else worse
I hate to watch you go
In the back of the cab
Staring back tears of sadness are running down your clothes
And all I want is you to stay
Baby at least one more day
It's like I'm dying every time you go
no no, no no
cause baby when you're gone, it just all feels wrong
I don't know what to do.
And when ya leave my side, it just don't feel right
I'm crazy about you, so I fall to pieces
(Way-oh) I fall to pieces
(Way-oh) I fall to pieces
Without you, without you..

They say the heart dies if it don't get a heart to heart
our mind shrinks if it can only hear its own thoughts
that's how it feels, cause without you i feel like its dark
when i need that light, you the spark
light it up, light it up, lighters in the air
what happens when a tree falls and there's noone there?
what happens when you can't go on cause you unprepared?
it's like poverty when you say goodbye to me

I'm broken, I'm broken, broken
I lift my eyes to God, I'm hopin, I'm hopin, hopin
that you come back soon
as I wash my face off in this bathroom
prayin that your flight won't be delayed
now love is that cruel? if so, thats cool
I ain't into loneliness anyway
if your boss gotta problem, he can see me anyday
Imma make it big so one day you never have to work
and we can eat linguini, sip martinis til our stomach hurt
and I knew that lookin back on our tears would bring laughs
but I never knew that lookin back on laughs would bring tears

Maejor

I fall to pieces (Way-oh)
I fall to pieces (Way-Oh)
I fall to pieces (Way-Oh)
Without you, without you
cause baby when you're gone, my whole world feels wrong
I don't know what to do.
and when ya leave my side, it just don't feel right
I'm crazy over you
I fall to pieces (Way-Oh)
I fall to pieces (Way-Oh)
I fall to pieces (Way-Oh)
Without you</pre>
