[Intro - Keri Hilson - talking]
A huh huh, not again
Ohh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

[Break - Kanye West]
Keep rockin and keep knockin
Whether you Louboutin up or Reebokin
You see the hate that they servin on a platter
So what we goin to have - desert or (disaster?)

[Verse 1 - Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this (this ...)
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip (trip ...)
Then you came in and knocked me on my face (face ...)
Feels like in I'm a race but I already won first place (place ...)
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinkin 'bout our life, our house and kids (yeah)
Every mornin, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

[Chorus - Keri Hilson] - 2X - w/ ad libs
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 2 - Ne-Yo]
I never thought I'd hear myself say
Y'all go ahead, I think I'm goin to kick it with my girl today (kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp ship flyin high (flyin high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile, shot me out the sky (oh, shot me out the sky)
Hey, so now I'm crashin, don't know how it happened, but I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster, don't you know I would baby if I could
+Miss Independent+ (oh, to the fullest), the load never too much, she helpin me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life (oh), I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl sometimes love

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs from Keri Hilson and Ne-Yo

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers
So we can finally fly off into NASA?
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughin
We, were never meant to be baby we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick
+Hey Young World+, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone thats only average
For advice, OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Whoa is me, baby this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flyin, now I'm crashin
This is +Bad+, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
Used to be your boyfriend, now I'ma has been

[Verse 4 - Keri Hilson]
So you got to take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't want to make the same mistakes I did
I don't want to fall back on my face again (whoa, whoa)
I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call (whoa, whoa)
And if it hits better make it worth the fall

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs from Keri Hilson and Ne-Yo

[Outro - Keri Hilson and Ne-Yo] - 2X - w/ ad libs
Won't see it comin when it happens
But when it happens, you're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down

Yeah</pre>
