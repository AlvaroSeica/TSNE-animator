[sample]
Just because he doesn't do what, everybody else does
Oh, that's no reason why, I can't give you all my love
Just because he doesn't do what, everybody else does
Oh, that's not reason why, we can't share our love

[Intro: Li-Mouse]
("Maybe") Maybe, I don't know, maybe...
("Maybe") Maybe, we just gotta, make money or become rappers or something, you know?
("Maybe") Maybe I, gotta, do handstands in the middle of the street, I don't know
("Maybe")  But yo, you need to listen, yo

[Li-Mouse]
("Maybe") I gotta go around with my hair all blown out
White BM, with my rims all chromed out
("Maybe") She'll look at me like I got dough
You don't want me because I wear my fitted real low
("Maybe") It's because I ain't above five feet, five inch
You don't know I come through in the clinch
("Maybe") It's because I come off a big cocky
Or is it that muthafucka trying to cock block me
Yeah, I'm coming through with the small stature
Is that the reason why, I can't look all atcha
Man I don't know, what else I can do
All I want is maybe to, speak with you
For a quick second, maybe even a whole minute
It's like I can't even get in it, to win it
Cuz you don't even give me the simple pleasure
I know my chances are small, that many can't measure
("Maybe") I gotta be a dick to get one of these chicks
Is that why you threw me over so quick (I don't know)
("Maybe") I'm just too good for who I go after
You think it's funny, but I can't hear no laughter
("Maybe") I gotta start popping some heavy 'roids
Start fighting cats like my first name was Floyd
("Maybe") I gotta what they say, make it rain
But that money will never erase such pain
I see all my friends get some real dime pieces
I feel like my time is up like some car leases
And I pray to the Gods that you'll just listen
And maybe you'll realise all the times you could be missing
But no, that will remain in my prayers
And you'll take the hand of those clown ass players
And I'll sit, and watch a good girl go real bad
Until your tears roll down your face and I'll be real...

[Cno Evil]
("Maybe") I need to switch up my style
This girl here hasn't peeped me in a while
("Maybe") I need to try something else
And put my old self back on the shelf
("Maybe") I'll go and try something new
A new attitude with a new pair of shoes
("Maybe") A whole brand new wardrobe
I'm on the payroll for a new set of clothes
So then I stroll to this cute little honey
she gave me a smile cuz my walk is sorta funny
But the little smirk she gave me convinced me that it worked
So now I proceed with the flirting
Hot thing with a tight white dress
She definitely tried to impress me
And bless me with a little dance
She grind and caress what was held in my pants
("Maybe") She knew exactly what she was doing
Didn't even know me or what I have been screwing
("Maybe") She just doesn't care
She took a long passionate stare
("Maybe") She just loves my eyes
Didn't even mind, all the other guys
("Maybe") She wants to be with me
Can this all be probably just a dream
Nah, it's real, cuz I pinched myself
Slow down, Johnny, it's bad for your health
She's so sweet, my little Summer Peach
We'll just relax and lay down at the beach
Catch some rays, splash from the waves
Raps my way, to snatch you from the gaze
Maybe, maybe, is the question
Baby, baby, you're my obsession</pre>
