[Fes Taylor]
I savagely attack beats, move smart in the streets
To avoid a rap sheet, the beast never made a charge stick
They eyes on me like chicks with enlarged tits
Cigar split, my click hotter than tar pits
Darts one twenty, and boys in blue suits
The streets ain't the same no more, I'm trynna school youth
My plans fool proof, you terrify when we zoom through
Letting off shots, out the moon roof
W-P, W-A-Double R, to the I, O, R, S, start trouble with stars
Smack 'em on TV, at the BET Awards
Everything a hit, we record, pray you see the lord
After you bleed on my sword, shank you like we up north
If you live and you know it, bust guns and jump off
If not, fall back, then we crack your spine
Trynna break down my rap lines like fiends for half a dime

[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
If you live and you know it, squeeze off (squeeze off)
If you live and you know it, squeeze off (squeeze off)
If you live and you know it, and you really wanna show it
Run up on that dude, yap his chain, squeeze off
If you nice and you know it, spit a dart (spit a dart)
If you nice and you know it, spit a dart (spit a dart)
If you nice and you know, and you really wanna show it
And rapper want it, put up 50 g's, spit a dart

[Fes Taylor]
Your money good as mine, it's kinda like if I took your shine
Stash your body, same place where I put the nine
I ain't braggin' or nothing, but I'm a gangsta nigga
I done done some wild shit in my life, drinking this liquor
Blowing this green, 14, devoted to CREAM
Getting money off these beat monsters, smoking they dreams
Playa, I show you the team, nothing but all-stars
Ready for war, roll like tanks over your sports cars
Bring heavy hitters out, my dirty south villains
Run up in this nigga house, from ATL to Georgetown
S.C., Winston-Salem, N.C., South East, D.C.
To B-More, M.D., Queensburg to Richmond, V.A.
C.T. stands for killas, the Harrisburg, P.A.'s
Connecting me to Albany, Brooklyn to Queens, Manhattan to Bronx
And back to my hood, where we Shaolin stomp

[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
If you drunk and you know it, get it crunk (get it crunk)
If you drunk and you know it, get it crunk (get it crunk)
If you drunk and you know it, and you really wanna show it
Start a fight in the club, get it crunk

[Fes Taylor]
Check it, this one not commercial at all, you not gangsta
911, you the first to call
Now tell me have you ever snatched a purse before
Or search pockets with people laying on the floor
Grimey since I came in the door, when I wasn't on the road
Juxing niggas, slide back on tour
With a new chain, damn it's like the kid switch up
Every six months, more chicks hold the gun for a dick suck
Maybe a quick nut, time is money, can't afford to slip up
So I do a buck in a big truck
Fes Taylor, ya'll gon' remember the name
But the truth is, rather have more money than fame
More dollars than problems, more guns than I got beef
Ya'll rap albums is boring, how can I not sleep
This my turn, gem star, then you south burned
Worry bout your own money, stop stressing with our hood

[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
If you live and you know it, squeeze off (squeeze off)
If you live and you know it, squeeze off (squeeze off)
If you live and you know it, and you really wanna show it
Run up on that dude, yap his chain, squeeze off
If you bang and you know it, throw it up (throw it up)
If you bang and you know it, throw it up (throw it up)
If you bang and you know it, and you really wanna show it
Put a flag on your gun, hit 'em up, hit 'em up</pre>
