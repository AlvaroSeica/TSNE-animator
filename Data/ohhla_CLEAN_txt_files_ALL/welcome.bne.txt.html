[Jhaz]
Welcome to my world
You know the procedure
Nothin' but playas and trues, man
It's a Jhaz thang
And a sista gets wrecked for her domain
Plain and simple, Ken Dawg rollin' with II Tru
Who you wanna bring?
Come along or come strapped
You and click of fools
AJay, AJay, a shot out to my playa realer
My world'll get with ya
Let the Jhaz inside of me, feel ya, hit ya
You don't wanna see us come ball with playas
No pressure, come along to scrap me and my crew;
We got them street sprayers
Welcome to my world, nothin' but the Jhaz
Top class, black jag with the cream rag
Zigzag? Nope, the Swisha
AJay is my click, believe my click'll get with ya
No bull, man, and once again, let me repeat
II Tru forever, runnin' through my veins
And heartbeat sweeta seat
Deep inside this smoke-ingested girl
This Mo Thug click is tight
Y'all, on the real
Welcome to my world

Welcome to my world
It don't stop, right
Welcome to my world

[Ken Dawg]
It's Mo Thug, it's Mo Thug
It's Mo Thug, it's Mo Thug
My mind is open, chokin' on this hit
Wig splitter, I got it bangin', hangin'
Doin' my thang and, yeah, these nuts swangin'
Slangin' these thangs, 'cause I'm Ken Dawg from the C;
Me and II Tru gonna fade them fake-ass wannabes
Mo Thug, much love, binding so strong
Puttin' it down in this bitch until playa like me gone
Welcome to my world: Hennessy until I hurl
Got my life on riches, bitches, yeah
You living thorough, but a
I'm a keep it real and keep your head cracked
Stay blueback off a sac and some Coniac
Po po - they steadily tryin' to put a playa in the pen
Welcome to the shit you put a nigga in, right, right

Welcome to my world

[Brina]
Shoot nothin' but hard game
It's a way that a sister come up on a brother's mental
True playas 'til the end
Understand if I gotta get mine
I  pimps 'em on the real, though
Brina runnin' game for the means of payment
Underestimatin' this playa
Make you wonder where your stash went
Bent, is the way you got me
Fools, these rules won't save ya
Testin' this II Tru techniques
Rollin' with nothin' but playas
This Mo Thug click
II Tru been known to break off much grip
Archie flossin' them realer
? tracks up in the nine-six
In my world, hater playas want to see hustlas die, fall
Jhaz got my back, uptightly shot
Breakin' hits with that Ken Dawg
It's my call, when it come to them games steady pushin' weekly
On top of the real, playin' the field, shootin' my regular freely
Believe me, my world only got room for trues, so welcome
Cleveland up in this industry servin' wrecks where I come from
Gotta maintain composure
Representing what becomes this life that this sista leads
'Til I reach my point up in this nine-six

Welcome to my world
Nine six and so on, let a playa go on</pre>
