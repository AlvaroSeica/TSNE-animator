[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Once upon a time there lived the harajuku barbie
Use ta watch the game in madison square garden
Collesium block on the weekend italian icees from the purteo ricans
She reps queens like a crown or a real poofy gown or the little white
Lady out in london weeds bridge far rock southside jamcia block
Flat bush brooklyn all of them jamcia spots
This is my city and I be reppin my city
It's where the giants attack you
Called the capitol apple
If you come to my city you might see what I mean
It's the city that never sleeps but it's the city of dreams

[Chorus: w/ad libs by Gudda Gudda]

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Wat up uptown downtown 6th ward
7th ward hardheads west bank 5th ward
3rd ward 10th ward reppin every damn street
Shout out the mighty nine and east 2 mczan street
Rest in peace son he had tyra lan on lockdown
It's a shame dey took him out the game
I see ya c c nacho fe fe snag gang Chuck D
Talley t street that's dem garetti boys all about
The fetti boy only think broke wrong here is the levi boy
U know my city nigga yea it's real hood
Talk to turk other day he doin real good
Hold ya head c hold ya head mack
Rest in peace solider damn we need you back
Shout out b.g. the whole chopper city
Cash money young money yea we got the city

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Short Dawg]
Let's welcome the katrina victims
I wasn't there when it happen but I seen the pictures
So ne thing my niggas need they can call short
My arms always opened like walmart
I moved to the A and promised I'm a be back
I'm still #1 in houston like t-mac
Check my sleeve test I know you see that
H with star syrup pourin over green back
N I ain't talkin miss butterworks
So pass me a styrofome double cup at first
N I'm a pour a four up in that and sip it till
U see me movin slow like I'm fat
Just the home of the the candy painted doors on the lac
N voices sounding deep as baratone on the track
(Aw really)
Yea we call that sprude and if you movin too fast we
Might call that rude
Houston
