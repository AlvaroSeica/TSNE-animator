[Doug E. Fresh]
Dig it, dig it
Dig it dig it - check it out
Uhh! Uhh..

Chorus: Doug E. Fresh

Spirit, some people hear it, some people fear it
Spirit, some people just won't go near it
Sho' as I'm me and you should know you're you
Your spirit is the key to unlock the true you
Spirit, some people hear it, some people fear it
Spirit, some people just won't go near it
Sho' as I'm me and the skies are blue
The Ghostbusters are back and all brand new

[Doug E. Fresh]
There's a force that's dwellin beneath the city
tellin you, what you need-need not do
and it's motion, stirs up commotion
Feedin off the people's inner emotions
Hatred, anger, to one another
A problem like that you call the Ghostbusters
In emergencies that deal with reality
makin sure we all be free
So we can like or dislike, cause people who just might
look so happy but feel so uptight
They can't handle the problem that they created
It's, from the depths of their spirit, c'mon

Chorus

[Doug E. Fresh]
C'mon, uhh!	{*dj scratches "That's all right"*}
Warm it up, say what? Huh
D, D, D, check it

Now that evil's presence make it pleasant in
every resident and take a mother's
newborn baby and Dana's the lady
to build an establishment
For an evil magician on a mission in the picthin position
And no condition, will stop him on the transition
of makin it in time, with the help of the slime
but somebody gotta draw the line
who stand for all, who you gon' call for the brawl
GHOSTBUSTERS, it's like that y'all
GHOSTBUSTERS, it's like that y'all
GHOSTBUSTERS - are back, GHOSTBUSTERS - are back
GHOSTBUSTERS, huh, it's like that y'all, HIT IT!

Chorus

[Doug E. Fresh]
C'mon!		{*dj scratches "That's all right"*}

There's been a lot of dimensions, and misconceptions
Certain things done for the wrong intentions
From people, who aren't sequel, to us
But for them to look down on us is a must
Situation, brainwash education
Here's a seed so let's plant a foundation
of newborn leaders, lawbook readers
Career coordinators and poverty feeders
Those that know me hear it and fear it
Know it's the truth so they scared to come near it
And you cheer it, as I share it, cause it's my

Chorus {- last line}
+ "the name of the brothers is the Get Fresh Crew, UHH!"
