(Sample:
What are you gonna do for the people?
I'd like to let everyone know that you're.. being recorded
This is being recorded live, live, live, live, live)

We believe in maximum effect
[And absolutely] every single facet of the gem
[Including] {but} [not limited to the]
{Pursuit of truth} [which has been] {unduly}
[Smoothed over] {made soothing} [to those]
Who have been doing the polluting in fact
{We wrote some raps}
[Now I have here in my chest an outline]
{A list}, [a platform], {manifesto}, [a mandate
 From intro] {to outro}, it's absolutely rock solid
 From the {bottom to the top} and the [top to the bottom]
{Here's a outlook}, and how it reads, [number one, Lateef]
{We don't believe in other people thieving the ideas
That our cerebrums cultivate and create, but if you're stealing them}
[Now that's a calculated mistake]
{A combination infinite involving digitized code.. you can't break, point two:}
[We believe in unconditional control
Not under supervision of another operator] {so}
[What that means is our beliefs our boundaries shall all be balanced properly
Without restriction, limitation or revoke, Point three:]
{We don't believe in you controlling we} [That's point three]
{I'm not obligated to listen to shit that you're telling me
That's the type of thing that could lead to a felony, I don't give a fuck
You yellin' at me at the top of your lungs, you do it
Otherwise it isn't gonna get done}, I hold the reins to my tongue
{And decide when to close and open the door}, the point four:
[Point four, you been warned, so before we move on
Just from point four on, just so you don't distort
The order make us go back and forth, once more
Let's repeat what we've recorded thus far, now point one:]
{We don't believe in other people thieving the ideas
That our cerebrums cultivate and create, make no mistake, point two:}
[We believe in unconditional control of our beliefs and our opinions
Our souls, our growth, and our dominions, point three:]
{We don't believe in you controlling we
I'm not obligated to do or say or listen to a god damn thing, a point four}
[Point four], {point four}, [point four],
{point four}, [point four], {point four}, [now point four]:

We believe in all of the above just for the reasons given
Up, livin' it up, livin' not.. givin' up - setting
Government and loving it, so we self-sufficient
Not trippin' off of that subliminal stuff
We not submitting coming with it rough and tough
We gonna suppliment your knowledge with.. a substance
We not gonna let an opportunity get left out
We not.. gonna let some indecision stop what we about
We not.. gonna show no mercy over flowing the drought
[It's no doubt], {no doubt}, [it's no doubt], {no doubt}
[It's no doubt], {no doubt}, [it's no doubt], {no doubt}
[It's no doubt], {no doubt}, 'cause this is what it's about, come on

We believe in {achieving the summit} [as expected]
{Detonate the avalanche effect}, [we bustin' rep]
{And watch the series of events connect a chain reaction
Set off like a fusion experiment}, [in which we can calculate]
{And document} [the elements] {and their effects}, with patience
{Put it all down in}.. scientific notation
{This is like a laboratory report}, [of sorts]
{Research} [results] {a layout of our} findings and methods that work
Here is our agenda, {an easily defensible}
[Census] {of live} [ammunition] {fire} [bullet] {point five}:
[We believe in looking] {alive} and recognize
[By the makeup of our character], {eyes}, [by our] {merits} [and] {vibes}
[Not as indistinguishable] {in appearance}
[But as] {equal} [keepers] {of the} inextinguishable fire, [point six]:
{We don't believe in a} [quick fix!] {to livin' it, a} [constant!]
{Routine of maintenance and a-} [djustment!], once in
[You gotta] {keep it} [jumpin'] {pumpin'} [pumpin'] {sayin'} [something]
{Before your severance} [ascend] {to point} seven, it's
[Seven's a reflection of our beliefs], {and histories}
[Events], {unpleasentries}, [and pestilence]
{Disease}, [insens-], {itivity}, [as reference]
{To be seen}, [as lessons], {a series}, [of tests], {and a complete}
[Testament] to our {team and} [strengths]
{As a means of} [success] now as a team take set, {point eight}:
[Point eight], {just to set it straight} [set it straight]
{Before we get too far up out of the gates, I'm going straight
Let's recap the way we came to that great point eight, like fate
And tell the fake why they can't create}

Point one: [No bitin']
Point two: [I'm writin']
Point three: [You ain't and]
Point four's point four
Point five: [Recognize]
Point six: [Make adjustments]
Point seven: [Is a testament]
Point eight: [Go on, set it now]
