(SINISTER)
Born in the middle of danger
Now I'm trapped in a cell
But it's more like a chamber
I got a murder so my life is thru
But a dog's gotta do what a dog's gotta do
(barks)
Especially when you're livin on the East Side
Gotta be strapped and ready for a muthafuckin homicide
Drive-byes happen day by day
Get caught in a spray by saint with the AK
One Time swoop cause they try to pop ya
3 seconds later there's a muthafuckin helicopter
In the air with their lights on pride
But they can't catch a nigga in a night
Who is runnin for his life
But y'all niggas keep on tryin
Cause punk muthafuckas gonna keep on dyin 
As long as they shift their asshole get wripped
With my sawed-off pump make 'em do a backflip
War is not the answer 
But if you're on the East Side
I bet you don't die of cancer
You'll probably die from the results of a jack move
Don't be the jacker Sinister fool
White muthafuckas complain about robberies
But they never complain about poverty
Got their nose in the air for what they got
Don't even think about comin to WATTS
Not even for a visit (?)
I wish they stay the fuck out of our business
But if they come that's a (?)
Cause I draw down and say:'fool brake yourself'
I don't want just cash
I want your gold, your car and a piece of the wife's ass
Now get your punk-ass on and I advise
Not to never come back stay the fuck off the East Side

(KIM ARMSTRONG)  
Bumpin on the East Side
Pumpin on the East Side
 (stay the fuck off the East Side)
You don't know a thang about the East Side
Bumpin on the East Side
Pumpin on the East Side
 (stay the fuck off the East Side)
You don't know a thang 'bout the East Side

(SINISTER)
Now I'ma rather ruthless, danger is kinda fellow
Born and raised in the muthafuckin ghetto
It's fame I want and ya know I might get some
But I won't forget where I came from
Fool, I can't leave my homeboys strugglin
Nigga I'm a dog so you know what's happenin
(barks)
Where I come from find no other place
To get no rougher, I'm a South Central muthafucka
Peelin caps is what I do for a living
Multiple gunshots wounds is what I'm giving
The suckers who get punked up like a godamned ballon
That is when my Gat goes *BOOM*
To your cap and peel your shit back, fool
That's what you get for wearin the wrong hat
Suckers get wounded
Wanna play me like a fuckin piano
I turn around and play 'em like a banjo
I know you didn't think that I can fade ya
But I can fade the muthafucka that fade ya
You talk shit and think you gonna get a pass
You'll slimp and I'ma bank that ass 
Cause of the Y the O the U the N the G
The M the O the double muthafuckin B -Young Mobbs
The niggas that don't give a fuck 
Cause a dog is a hog and a punk is a shot
Cops that patrole South Central 
Always talk the shit but don't know what the fuck they get in to
Yo, they must want static and I'll spray they ass
With the fully automatic AK, fool
And I bet that the bulletproof vest won't help you
Don't get quiet now, talk up
And feel the results of a walk-up
You punk muthafuckas better slack up
Cause I don't give a fuck if you go 'n get your back up
Simply a massacre a hell of a joy ride
I'm tellin you G ya can't fuck with the East Side

(KIM ARMSTRONG) 3x
Bumpin on the East Side
Pumpin on the East Side
 (stay the fuck off the East Side)
You don't know a thang 'bout the East Side
Bumpin on the East Side
Pumpin on the East Side
 (stay the fuck off the East Side)
You don't know a thang 'bout the East Side</pre>
