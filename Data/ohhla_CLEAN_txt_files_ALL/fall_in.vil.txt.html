Chorus:
To fall in love,
with the things you do
don't sell yourself 
to fall in love
with those things you do.

(T-3)
Lady's lovin my music is like some sex shit,
niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick.
run around the cornner to pick up the new shit,
toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep.
I'm the motherfucker gripping the mic like it's a joke,
niggas fall in love with the music like its a hole.
Put donw your mic you lost your whole goal,
you take it to seriously like it's a gamble.
Fuck this rap shit i listen to classical,
in the studio you ask usual,of the
-my lyrical
-of bitches who you would know.
I'm out of this cause you wanna be below.
Yall niggas in love with the S,
Yall niggas in love with the S.

(Jay-Dee)
yeah, jetty man i see sometimes,
i sit and wonder when i think about these written rhymes.
How'd i get to the point constantly taking all my time?
Time i could of been spending gettin' cash, gettin' mine.
Hopeing one day it comes around.
One day when i'm the nigga gettin' money, gettin' cash, gettin' signed
Getting the fuck out the ghetto, cause i'm tired of crime.
But it's a crime that i feel this fucking waste of time.
But sometimes i feel like this shit here is a waste of time, yours and mine.
To these niggas out here trying to rhyme.
Your reason for a better should of been genuine.
I do it because it gives me a sort of peace-of-mind.
And for the love.

Yourself, yourself
(Chorus)
