* song used in the show "Aqua Teen Hunger Force"; possibly from this CD

I want candy, bubble gum and taffy
Skip to the sweet shop with my sweetheart Sandy
Got my pennies saved so I'm a sugar daddy
I'm her Hugh Cronyn, she's my Jessica Tandy, I want candy!

Gonna get ya asses kicked
Nasty
Do it to your daddy, embarass your own family
Just 'cause you came in front of a kid and his candy
I need candy
Any kind'll do
Don't care if it's nutritious or "FDA approved"
It's gonna make me spaz like bobcats on booze
A hyperactive juice that only I can produce

Use a giant drill, bore straight into hell
Releasin ancient demons from a sleep forever spell
So they can walk upon the earth, and get resituated
And hawk the diet pills that MC Pee Pants have created

Mess up the mix, mix up the mess
Come on down yo, here's the address
I said six, one-two Wharf Avenue
Six, one-two wharf avanue</pre>
