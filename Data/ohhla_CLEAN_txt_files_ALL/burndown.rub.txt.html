[Rubbabandz]
Aiyo, Bandz is the truth, burn down the booth
O.J. ain't even got this much juice
Kill a nigga, I walk, and I ain't gotta take shit to trial
Cuz I ain't never ever get caught
Gun at the bottom of the river
No murder weapon, no case, nigga
Feds try to catch me slipping from New York to Alabama
Laying low, and I'm out here tipping on
Four-four, and I'm getting more hoes
And I'm kicking more goals, and I'm robbing more o's
And I'm growing more dro, and I'm doing more shows
And I'm getting love like a muthafucka, ya'll don't even know
I'm a city slicker, down in the dirty like this
Them country boys sure know how to flip a brick
Put big wheels on them old school whips
And I'mma push through on some brand new shit
Six hundred Benz, 23 inches on the rims
Rally stripes, headshots, wear them shorts, two Timbs
Look at the kid, New York, I'm bald through my veins
You can tell by the way I walk, how my chain swing

"New Jack City" 2x

[Rubbabandz]
I might run up in the spot, jack a nigga for his goods
No lie, I'm just telling how I grew up in the hood
No silver spoon in my mouth, listen to my story
No bandwagon ride, I really live down south
But I'm New York to the home, so don't get it twisted
I'm 718, 10304, committed
I heard niggas up top, all on the airwaves
Man, cuz your shit flop when it drop
Man, hip hop is hip hop, everybody know
The best rapper was Biggie, and then came Pac
All these mad rappers stuck on the block with no deal
No grind and no skills, they need to stop
Niggas gon' postal, wouldn't hurt a fly
But'll kill a thousand niggas in the booth wit they vocals
Studio gangstas, gangsta rappers
Never heard your name in the streets before, stop acting
You ain't a killa, you just talk a lot
Wit your rusty six shooter, you ain't making shit shot
Your gun is boring, kidnap your broad
You a clown killa, you can get killed tomorrow</pre>
