[Intro: Dusty Springfield's "Magic Garden"]
"From pipe cleaners, cards, and dominoes
 And it won't fall dooooooooooooooown..."
 
[Intro: Phonte]
Yea..
New Tigallo New Tigallo New Tigallo New Tigallo
 
[Chorus: Phonte]
Yo, we go off 
Say who go off? Nigga we go off
Flow fitted to a tee, dog I might go golf
On stage in all black, dog I might go goth
Say I might go floss, 'cause we go hard
I mean macro-hard, not +Microsoft+
Party time excellent, nigga I might go Garth
'Cause we go off, I said we go, yo hold up...
 
[Phonte]
Niggas lookin like fools punchin out of their weight class
Lookin like food under pressure they +break-fast+
It's lookin like school and I'm the invincible principal
Joe Clark and you niggas sign in, get a late pass
Yeah nigga, I go boss, 'cause once the buzzer go off
Don't nobody give a FUCK what you ranked as
It's only wins and losses, Benz and Porsches
So pardon if I offend any friends or sources
that never seen the hunger, no, meager portions
Starvation, bar none like Klondike
They sayin Phonte's the incarnation of verbal murder 
Pin it on me like prom night, nigga
'Cause I go off, yeah I go off
Negro spiritual rap, slave to the rhythm 
looking like I might go North, 'cause I go off
Yeah I go, yo hold up...
 
[Pharoahe Monch]
Pharoahe the god strike the mic hard like Ty Cobb with a bat
Physicist, the antithesis of Steve Jobs when he raps
Smack, sick gonorrhea, CLAP~! Onomatopoeia 
{*smack*} Smack the shit out you, you have no idea
Send a stranger to rearrange your Range Rover, key your Kia
P'll see ya via satellite with money +Longer+ than Nia's
FUCK chivalry, I will end a chick's career
and +Return to Forever+, I am Chick Corea
At O'Hare Air will surface to air missiles for your Lear
{*missle sound and explosion*} --
..what you will hear before I send you to visit Aaliyah
Proceed with caution, he strikes with force and of course
He is the boss of sorcery with a cross to bear
and a culture enforcing the nuclear laws of North Korea
So awesome, when we morphin
Pharoahe, Tigallo, we go off, a-go off, a-yes yes Y'ALL!
 
[Chorus 2: Phonte]
We go off 
Say who go off? Nigga we go off
Flow fitted to a tee, dog I might go golf
On stage in all black, dog I might go goth
Yeah, we gon' floss, we go so hard
I mean macro-hard, never +Microsoft+
Stomach AND the titties out, baby girl go Ross
'Cause we go off, yeah we go off, yeah</pre>
