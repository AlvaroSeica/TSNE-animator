"Very special part of my life and I know my heart would never be free, ohh"

[Chorus]
Listen, I got a story to tell
There's women on the corner with pussy for sale
This, making me wait ain't goin too well
You, making me wait got me horny as hell!
Yo, I got a story to tell
There's women on the corner with pussy for sale
This, making me wait ain't goin too well
You, making me wait got me horny as hell!

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, are we fuckin or not?
Yeah I gotta ask 'fore I come to the spot
Cause I'm spendin gas money and it's gettin me hot
Talkin 'bout makin out and shit 
I'm a lil' too -- old, for dry humpin
I either get to come inside or I ain't comin
It's nothing! Whatchu talkin 'bout 90 days?!
..That nigga Steve Harvey craze!
If I ain't gettin in here
So what I liked you girl, I'ma get it somewhere
Be clear, of everything that I'm sayin
Neither one of us in a position to be playin
So when I come through, you gon' come too
FUCK Steve Harvey, girl whatchu try'n do?
Yo, let me get a stink finger then
What you think about just puttin the tip in?
We go together, no sex, stop trippin
It ain't like you a virgin so quit bullshittin
Probably got some good pussy just babysittin
("It's only been two weeks, you don't know me like that!")

[Chorus]

[Outro]
