[Phonte]
Ooooh, I got some things on my mind, would you mind?
Ooooh, don't worry I'm feeling fine, feeling fine
Heeey, to lay with you is simply divine, so divine
Ohhh yeah, think I got lucky this time, this time

Look, now here's a thought, we're unprepared
For love so filthy, no I don't want it
Don't even care of that I'm guilty
No doubt about it, we're nearly there
And on the inside, good God almighty
I'm really scared, it's not what I've known

[Bridge]
So what about the real possibility
perfection only lives in your mind?
And what if we both have the ability
to be each other's lucky find?

[Chorus]
On a day, on a day like today
Gonna change my point of view
On a day, on a day like today
Gonna try me something new
On a day, on a day like today
My grey skies turn to blue
On a day, on a day like today
I'll find my way to you

[Phonte]
Now look inside, what do you see?
The opportunity for all you wanted
How it should be, a life without love 
So cold and broken, no not for me
You let your guard down and all I'm hoping
That you would see, just how much we've grown

[Bridge]
So what about the real possibility
perfection only lives in your mind?
And what if we both have the ability
to be the one that we hoped to find?
Get out the way of your happiness
Let go of all you know that's not true
Why should we call for a better day
When now's the time to see it through?

[Chorus]</pre>
