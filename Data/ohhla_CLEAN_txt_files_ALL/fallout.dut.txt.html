[Hook: 2X]
Don't ever push yourself against the wall
Cause everybody at a time knows it gets raw
And if you step, we're gonna shatter your jaw
Cause if your fuckin with one kid yo, you fuckin wit 'em all

[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
(Who the fuck are you?)
???
Rubix Cubin, unsolvable the high-tech arsenals
shiny metal things spit something horrible
vocal ?arrangements? inaudible
pistol whip you, mandatory not optional what you stupid?!
my clique consists of dirty dawg's and Cubin Mafia ?children?
Plastic explosive play dough the money is mine if I say so
ain't no, thing in this universe that could ever be my match
Celph Titled without fly raps is like Slick Rick without an eye patch
Now how you like that?
Yup, my recipes dope I'm used to the game like Jeopardy under the oath
And lethal like white boys in trench coats
Straight up and down I'm serving nigga's with sixteen bar sentences
my spoken word is contagious and cancerous
I cancel kids like answering machine messages left by solicitation receptionists
Like my man Dutch Massive we aggressively reppish it (ain't no question kid)
lurking in the everglades
while you at home watchin cartoon's
I'll be sittin' on a dock of a baay, with a harpoon

[Hook: 2X]

[Verse 2]
And pissed off the wrong one
Hand break my pencil piece when I write this
A head storm shatter skulls
speaking of blood sport, splattered over all
pearly white, fresh conscience
blazin' adrenaline behavin rude an absurd
while the ?out of stage? criticize from the outside viewing in
observin' and stressin' us, the tropics?!
fuck all you corn hole fuckers, with no logic
bringin the heat, scorching your bare feet
sprintin' butt naked, long distance
? movin objects, direct shots but beaming optics
and that's the instincts of a natural
at time, if you ain't hard right
I split bricks, strictly certified blaze shit

[Verse 3]
Light speed I'm sonically inclined with godly insight
nigga's get blown to bits like megabytes, can't fuck with this aight
storm dash trooper, the cybernetic intelligence
the fifth element regiment, crush your residence in to ?sediments?
encrypted flows with the centrifugal dialect
the Puerto Rican cybernetic one
authentic while you synthetic son
I hold down the galaxy with unanimous connections
quantum physics expert rippin' holes right through your guess shirt
the seven squadron dynasty get down and dirty violently
walkmen and freestyles with the emcee seeking missiles
atomically stay blazin' ?acrolly? bout to black out of this
is tampa's side of things and that's what eight-one-three's about

[Hook: 2X]

[Verse 4]
yo I sense anger, how you gonna diss a total stranger?
talk about my records I'ma hafta rearrange ya
feel this laser, your not who you pretend to be
knock off your identity and aim for longevity
fuck your ?, I can do without your comments
the livest player on a catcher burning comet
you make me vomit, sick of all your trends
if I break all keyboards before tracks the whackness ends
constantly stay blazin', FLA is dumb hot
no glocks baby boy, I'll smash your jaw with a cinder block
hard knock not, I'm just a little anti-social
? we world wide, while y'all think we still local
my name is DutchMassive remember that shit
I'm killin kids cause that ??
only got a few close friends, and that's way too much
cause soon they'll all jock us when we blow the fuck up</pre>
