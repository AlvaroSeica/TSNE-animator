Make no mistake we create our own fate
And so, let's go
Don't hesitate ain't got no time to waste
To regain control, regain control

Jas Mace

Don't you love it when the sun's shining like perfect diamonds
No more cold days make you want to live another way
I know times get hard, leave you mentally scarred
When everyday you're living broke and this life is a joke
You lost all hope, but just maintain
Because after the rain they'll be sunshine again
I'm screaming fuck the fame what's in a name
But fake money and friends, the means rarely justify the ends
It's all a disguise let's organize
And get the blind fold from off our face and prioritize
Open your eyes, let the light adjust your sight
I know you want proof but it ain't hard to see the truth
Try to open a book and look, research yourself
Let's get it together there's much more to life than wealth
I see clearly now the rain is gone
Meditate for a minute now the pain is gone
You gotta get up get out and get something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You gotta get up get out and get something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high

Boogala

I want to start my own business so what's holding me back
It must be the arms of laziness that's keeping me trapped
In the dryer of stagnation suspend my elevation
Drowning in the air of the time that I'm wasting
I can't turn my back on what I need to be facing
So this year I subtract doubt and add patience
Abolish mental slavery and free my mind
The poetical architect it's success that I design
Travel through lives tunnels in due time I see the shine
Because the light waits to greet me I move discretely
In silence, I let my bank account speak in volumes
Get up or lay down and the that's the bottom line
And it's sponsored by the line that I'm trying to be on top of
The CEO of my life's decisions
Word to Fred Sanford I'm a have my own business
My life my life my life
I'm a life it, sincerely

Hook (Dreez)

Make no mistake we create our own fate
And so, let's go
Don't hesitate ain't got no time to waste
To regain control, regain control

I used to watch flicks by Freddie Kruger
And now I smoke spliffs and carry rugers
Poor out some Genius for those niggas that finished
Replenish their soul but are you talking a limes or lemons
Rhymes is business and it's business as usual
You see the math like the image of numerals
Pure the cure when exposed it trembles
Like the feeling of up in the club when your love's resembled
To the chest like stray shots or straight shots
It's the reason why us peaceful niggas hate cops
Jas rocks Bully rocks yeah we all rock
Every next New Year let the ball drop
Jamal I-I to the Isaac
Let's take a little trip deep like Poseidon
Beats be inside me, my heart is a kick
And since I've started to spit, yo the harder it kicks
A yo I start to flinch as I try not to say it
But my lips is like an oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like an oowop as I start to spray it
My lips is like an oowop, yeah you know the rest

Zig

In this profession ain't no time for questions
You in or your out I'm a write with the pen until it's out
And every word that I send from my mouth
I confirmed, if it ain't your concerns then you need be out
I feel hip-hop needs me out
A lot of kats talking thug when they scarred to leave the house
Fawcett flow, verbs stay leaking out
Floss the flow with no doe to speak about
Liquid plumber I'm bump until my shit come out
Kick the drummer accapella flow spit come out
Forget the Hummer I need more fans this summer
Zig, Jas, and the Bully make hits come out
So get a grip, or better yet cop the Grip
My flow will make a killer want to hop and skip
And I ain't talking about nines and what they poppin' with
Yo you better heed the words that the prophet spit it's like

Make no mistake we create our own fate
And so, let's go
Don't hesitate ain't got no time to waste
