Mr. Steele here's your dose of 325 fantastic milligrams

(Time)
slightly number then your arm that you slept on
lighter then a hospital balloon
my mattress is a flying carpet
collapsed lungs aint nothing
blown out knees used to be something
broken ribs feel like hic ups
garden hose in my chest
drink it off like a vet
pain is fiction, fantastic prescriptions
of roller coasters, gum drops and sushi
aspirin is john candy and naked gun movies
teeth getting pulled crack like candy corn
theres gauze in my molar's
god's a bull dozer
used to scrape knee caps falling in the alley
gravel bloody palms, stigmata, JESUS
Augustus Pablo's my ny-quil
let me see my pharmacist ill read on the road on my front porch
legs numb, pressure in my ear my heads a torch
rolled ankles make me think of july
the letter P makes me fly, in fantastic HA nobody CRIES
broken arms they make me giggle
nausea's a reward, my mom's a nurse
Don't worry death don't hurt
Don't worry dead don't hurt
Don't worry death don't hurt

when you die your friends will take your shirts

(AwareNess)
in fantastic nobody's arm sleeves turn into hand gloves</pre>
