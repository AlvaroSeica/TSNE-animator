[Killer Mike]
Bitch we be that shit, that's right
#2, boo-boo, straight caca
I smoke ganja with a dreadlocked rasta
Move like Frank you will die like a hassa
Move like Jesus, die like a martyr
Hell of a choice when you ridin a Lamonta
Tryna get some hoes in a hot car
"How far is we away, mayne?" Not far
The greatness they claim - not are
Are not; we are those juggernauts
Me, El, we hail 
like a young Che Guevera and Fidel Castro
Cash flow, car full of females
Bad hoes, we in the D.R.
Any fuck rapper boy gettin out of line
I pray the preacher beat him to the goddamned E.R.
(E.R., E.R., E.R....)
I spit them country rap tunes like hee haw
Cocaine flow, fishscale, no re-rock
Take a snort for yourself shorty, see he raw
{*sniffs*} See he raw!
That's you shorty, go an' snort your nose off
Then put the news in the streets, Tom Brokaw
Cause of you shorty met a bad stone bitch out of Brooklyn
and that Brooklyn bitch straight got broke off
Then she called homegirl from the BX
Freaky little Rican brought X and we sexed
Couple months later brought 'em down to Atlanta
Let 'em style on the 'Bamas, that's right yeah we flex
Heard she got a baby daddy and the nigga actin aggy
Runnin round talkin 'bout yeah he plexed
Nigga betta pray for a hoe like he Tebow though
Cause right now he stay losing like the Jets

[Chorus: El-P]
And I walk around like I got a 36" chain...
And I walk around like I got a 36" chain...

[El-P]
Bitch we be that shit, that's right
Light a flare, put your thumbs in the air, high five
I came for the stash box, gimme that
I been waiting for this all my life
3 AM and I'm still not right
Still awake, still away from fading, crazy
Psilocybin, why the ride so hazy?
Dribble this spit 'til the street gets wavy
The bliss in pure shit magician, git to skippin
Not too tall and dark and handsome man
But I talk dark for ransoms man
Spent grands on those zombies, folded origami, yes I bag the clams
Anyone object to the styles get a smile and a backwards hand
(...backwards hand ....backwards hand)
Peep that felonious face in the place of an angel
Bringin that buckshot back to the table
Been a vet-eran, earth bound hellion
Try to say grace get a face full of staples
Woke up and the city air smelled like maple
If you come straight from New York, you relate
If you come straight from another place, stay too
Me and Mike got the whole map held safe

[Killer Mike]
Be it NYC or the ATL
From the ceilings of heaven to the gates of hell
We murder death killed every stage we step
Homicide times two, better warn yourself 
El

[El-P]
Anybody looking for some trouble better self-med
We could Double Dutch in a minefield, hell gets
just the right temperature, breakbeat minister
Riverdance cleats on your face for the finisher
