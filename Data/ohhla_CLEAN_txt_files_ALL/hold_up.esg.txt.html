[Hook - 2x]
(ten thousand, on the wrist for the boss)
Now hold up
(ten thousand, on the wrist for the boss)
Now hold up
(ten thousand, on the wrist for the boss
Told me take my chain off, let my body defrost)

[E.S.G.]
Huh, go on po' you a cup
G'eah you's a G mayn, go on throw it up
Huh you blowing big mayn, go on smoke it up
Look how we walk down here, look how we talk down here
When I say swang and bang, I ain't talking bout a Crip or Blood
The way we do our cars, is ridiculous
You call em rags, man we call em drops
Y'all call your money qwat, man we call our knots
Call our female bops, don't punch clocks or ride stocks
Went to school with my rocks, nothing but money in my lunch box
Bigfoot sasquatch, that's how I'm stepping in the game
Step down for a minute, they let the nigga gain
Now I'm speaking at the podium, smooth as lenolium
Southside veteran, paint wetter than petroleum
Yeah, so watch me do my thang
So go on ride with your boy, if you understand my slang

[Hook - 2x]

[E.S.G.]
Yeah world, guess who's back
Might not know me or not, come to the bottom of the map
Screwed Up Click regime, one of the hardest on the team
Range Rovers sporting mean, like bulvarian cream
Back in the day me and K, apple green Suburban
Took 36 to 88, like changing Bettis to Irvin
Talking OZ's, cause we OG's
Look like a janitor's office, cause my desk full of keys
Whole neck's full of B's, want my stash a hundred
Got some'ing for you jackers, that'll blast ya ski mask dummy
To the boys that tried to rob me, show me where that spot at
I put that on my mama, that's where you gonna ride at

[Hook - 2x]

[E.S.G.]
Working the wheel keeping it real, down South we call it trill
This one year my dreams fulfilled, no more teams hogging the deal
Paying my mills displaying my skills, self defense I had to kill
Had the car had the crib, way before had the deal
Street credit but popping it still, never been known for popping a pill
Dream setters that's for real, even Nelly got a grill
I never sky dived, they say it's real hard
I never climbed a mountain, watch me climb the billboards
Can't go to jail snitches tell, bout every gram you sell
Say they love me game is ugly, like Sam Cassell
Independent Roger Clemens, better back down trick
I heard enough about you kings, let me see if that crown fit
