Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Step through the door she peeking
I need the girl she eyein'
She want me I know it
My neck look like it's snowin'
I'm a lonestar like Texas
She on my dick like magnums
Gold wrappas little sonny
Yellow diamonds on my chain make my neck look sunny
Never bun b vans on my feet
Tiny toon tickles shine bright see the teeth
Got cheese gotta watch out for rats
I'm bigger than the mice so I keep the mouse traps
A lot of snakes in my hood gotta keep a low grass
Nicknamed "Jeff" 'cause I'm known for killin' tracks
Bass wood (bass wood) punk rock (punk rock)
Ice so right all you gotta do is stop

[Chorus: x2]
Diamonds they gleamin' I'm icey they cheesin' (hey)
bitch I'm shinin' (somebody's watchin' me)
bitch I'm shinin'

[Verse 2]
Diamonds on neck (neck), diamonds on my watch piece
Gleam watch the gleam rock game caranthang
Girls say D "Why are you lookin' so cold?"
I don't know but the carats in my neck look froze
Like mess toe do's get on my hype
Gotta have nice toes to get on my bike
That bitch big ass and the cast look right
Fresh, fresh everyday makes my belt look tight
Don't play no games when I'm in the club
All my niggas get back and they're rollin' up dubs
Get hit with the chopper you're back to the rug
See me off for when I should've lean
Homies fuck her, watch me should've lean
Young nigga got ice and I'm feelin' so fresh
Niggas gettin' money and we all fillin' checks
My niggas gettin' money and we all fillin' checks (hey)

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
2, 800 I'm a crack street stunner
Diamonds shinin' blue like thunder
Pops see the ice pop give me the number
Brisk color or piss I'm stuntin' in dis bitch (bitch)
Red ice, green ice, she's on my dick
Yellow stones in my ear, baby, I got tips
Rippers hit my sidekick she's fiendin' for that stunners stick
My prick, my wrist, she love that shit
And I'm single handcuff you bitch
She like I'm icey my vans on no Nike's
I'm about dollars and I'm even about cents
You're tripping off a bitch, you ain't even makin' sense
I'm ridin' down the strip I'm puffing purple shit
And I'm thinkin' how to get a hundred thousand out a bitch (yeah)

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 4]
Yeah, a bitch I'm shinin'
Visible set vvs white diamonds
Yea so what you know about this
One key on my keyboard look like piss
Can't see no gold on the mold
Just ice so I talk kinda cold
Fake stones on a girl that's nasty
Diamonds touch you, shit don't ask me
Fresh off the plane from the ATL
Mixin' my album and my shit's gonna sell
I'd keep it on the low but you're bitch gonna tell
All my niggas rock ice and we shine real well
Bitch and I'm gonna raise hell
Gotta jug you, nigga, for I drop this mail
Watch it rain on a bop watch her shake that tail I'm a stunner
Nigga (a stunner nigga)</pre>
