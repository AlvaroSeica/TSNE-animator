[Sluggy Ranks]
We don't want no weapons
No weapons!
Don't need no ammunition
No ammunition!
It's killing off the nation

Guns and knives take people's lives
It's true (for real)
Whoa, it's true, ooh-yay
(x2)
(Easy Mr. Sluggy)


[Wise Intelligent]

I'm 'bout to rob the robbers, kill the killers
Flow stealers bear witness to the Thriller in Manila
Sluggy the singer beside the teacher
Brother J, Dark Sun Rider
Sixty six thousand seven hundred five and a half miles per hour
Submit while you circle the sun
One ton, the weight of every jewel I drop inside you
Got you wide, in a minute I'mma get you wider
God is the highest form of living mind math and matter
Negroes, complete the data
Your nation's lacking, you're at the bottom of the living line
Why? Cause Whitey screwed your simple mind
You was a God now you're the sucker of the planet Earth
And crowned your woman slut of the universe
Pimping, leaning, fiending, scheming
Trying to be the cooleest nigga for some frozen other reason
That spit, it ain't slick on any known planet
Except for Pluto I believe
Three billion six hundred and eighty million miles away from something
That's why you ain't saying nothing
Heads is fronting, forty ounce and Phillies blunting
Destructing before your sleepy eyes (ooh-yay)
Teacher Wise will have you all recognize
In minutes less than five niggas ain't 'bout this
It seems as if hip hop's become a species in danger
Since rappers turned gangsta

[Sluggy Ranks]

Guns and knives take people's lives
It's true 
Whoa, it's true, ooh-yay ee
(x2)
(Yes it's true, come come come)

[Brother J]

Now Vibal Magus in the house I've come to address the drama
And season up and serve couch potato Godfathers
Overdose on movies, come up living like a script
Form an overnight mob getting paid to talk shit
Niggas please, my nickname is Mr. Freeze
I ice steel at lockdown and bring master keys
I'm chain ganging these crews, long lines of emcees
Come off the final plank, slave ships of wannabes
I journey to your roots as I burn them Zoot Suits
Revive the nigga genes revoked while playing cute
I execute studio gangsters up on the scene
Strong tug to mic cord, submits my guillotine
To eat 'em up and split 'em, 'nuff heads is rolling down
Degrading gangsta lean, black hole is going down
You're mudbone, and I stand with ranges shown
Thought you'd build a house, soon find you're home alone
With full black intangibility
Translating my heat to unreachable degrees
Of super burn as my crew holds you in turn
Lyric armageddon, when will you bunglers learn
That superfly groupies, braid heads and dreads too
Watch too much too gallant try to run it like the screw
Create a revolution says the realm is upon you
The righteous be the gods and the chosen be the few
It's like that uh

[Sluggy Ranks]

You can't blow breath in the end
So why you wanna take someone's life
It's not right, no it isn't wise, ooh yay ooh yay
Gotta move the right way
Don't let the devil lead you astray
That is right, whoa that is right, ooh yay ooh yay
Father send us some blessings
To wash away our sins
Stand up for the positive
Ay, and I'll deal with negative
Iy, we're killing them with conscious vibes
Killing them with positive vibes
It's nothing but conscious style ooh yay ooh yay

Guns and knives take people's lives
It's true 
Whoa, it's true, ooh-yay
