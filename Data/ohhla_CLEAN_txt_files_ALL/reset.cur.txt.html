Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You niggaz is, cheap greens, artificial turf
Second in the presence of better, me first
Captain america, versus captain planet, I control the larger area
Super hero no cape, delta force in the third grade
Now or laters, basketball cards in my school pants
How to be a player, got to ask then you can't afford the movie neighbor
Drop jewels like a buttterfinger watch maker
Money so old it deserve an in home caretaker
I been talking this shits for a minute, never been called out just been called that nigga
I paid dudes and I tipped em' I ain't trippin
Check yo' prescription, linches I'm not Pippen
We both scoring, but mines more awesome
Bitches called him, we smell the weed in the Air Jordans, yeah

Over land... sea.air, scratch it off the list after I been there
Yeah, jets, everytime I drop bars the bar is reset
Stack change, and I didn't change, looking down on these fools
Balcony rap, I'm way too high for that, bullshit so save it neighbor I'm on my paper

Bitch what you think this is, I only fucking twice, girl what you think you did?
Ain't nobody throw rice, spitta, ninja, precise, slice
Overheat never, under pressure, sweat ice, what's pressure
I never felt pressure in my life, it's been a cake walk
Frosting on my nikes, don't let em' talk
Cut a hater wind short, chevrolet bowtie, tips on the end of my exhaust pipe
Bitches at the window pray they hear that sound every night
But I'm out baby, you my home girl but this not my house lady
Can't go for that, [?]
Fall through, get the cut, clean up, change clothes
Adherent to the jet code, you know how we roll</pre>
