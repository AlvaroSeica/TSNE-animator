[Acyelaone-Talking]
Fuck is up? What's happening?
Yo, tell you a fucking story
Tell you a fucking story

[EL-P]
Here we go, huh!

[Aceyalone-Chorus]
Once upon a time in a city called Shit
Lived a man named "What The Fuck?!?!?"

[EL-P]
He used to clown around with his dick in the ground
And one day his dick got stuck

[Aceyalone]
He was kicking and screaming and yelling
and cussing and asking everybody for help

[EL-P]
Then he ran into a man named "Fuck You Too"
And he told 'em he should help himself

[Aceyalone]
He was so frustrated with his dick getting ?
And he had no one to call

[EL-P]
Then he gained control climbed out the hole
Motherfucker you better save his balls

[Aceyalone]
Now everytime I think about "What The Fuck!?!?!"
I think about you

[EL-P]
And how he changed and took all the pain
When he ran into "Fuck You Too"

[EL-P]
Hey yo peel the fuck out
Pop the clock, weave through the traffic, backwards once
Straight from the Wasteland, modern luck
Tainted, baked, and ate in hot sun
It ain't the same when I murk the surf
In above the whimp truck to ?  swervin
We play the game like bitch you ?
And Ace in a hole like..

[Aceyalone]
You talk nervous!
My mind is filled with a thousand kills
But no ? MC's can face this skills
Pop the peel, bug the fuck out, brake the fuck out when I grab that steel
The neutrilizer, the equilizer, meet the heat ?
Burn your high riser
Roof on fire and so is the first floor
Keep sticking you, until it don't hurt no more

[EL-P]
I've seen modern thugs with a virtual headset
Programmed modern but those who ain't dead yet
And yet vets turn into  ?
Sick of how murdering men became into ? set

[Aceyalone]
Nuts and bolts, programming gears
And shots to targets, head gets clear
Try to play brave from a bottle of bear
But you can't play hero if you're cape say's "Fear"

[Aceyalone and EL-P]
[EL-P:Man]Fuck you too!
[EL-P:Fuck]Man, fuck you too!
[EL-P:Come on!] Fuck you too! [EL-P:Come on!]
[El-P:Matter fact] Fuck you're all crew!

[EL-P]
Welcome to the circus of stars
Sit down! Mind reach collapse rat, fractured clown!
I was ? with a stop of four year old recording
And smiling with ? for a boy who was born pour through mourning
In the morning, escape my glory
The citys on fire but I can't stop warming
Sick with the vision of my ? burning
Stick with what I mention and I'll splif you lip
Warning!

[Aceyalone]
They wanna jump into the battle and earn their respect
Well get the fuck up! Let me cash this check
I'm still on deck with a mouth fill of poison
Spitting at you and your crew when your ? in
Raining parades leave stains on a blade
I came with the raid and I'm leaking with your head
I walk home alone from the terror dome
FULL! Because hungry wolves need to be fit

[EL-P]
Yo, I punch strokes and I crunch the clock
THEREs sharks in the moat and ? in the ?
WHERE cops and kids bust shots not to live
Bitch, shut your ball park and talk to the fist

[Aceyalone]
Marksmanship and the parks don't slip
You marks get lit up and hit him so quick
It's dark in the pit you betta watch what you do
Fuck you motherfuckers!

[EL-P and Aceyalone]
Fuck you too!

[Aceyalone-Chorus]
Once upon a time in a city called shit
Lived a man named "What The Fuck?!?!?"

[EL-P]
He used to clown around with his dick in the ground

I think about you

[EL-P]
