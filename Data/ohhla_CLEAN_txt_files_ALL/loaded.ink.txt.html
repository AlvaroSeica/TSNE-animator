Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You can tell I ain't even try to fit in
Probably somewhere you can't even get it
Don't try, we gonna be here for a minute
Tell 'em I ain't leaving till late finish, and

I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Loaded, I'm loaded, four shots in and
I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Loaded, I'm loaded, where should I begin?

Gotta find it in a drill, my niggas got it, still
Real with the real, my DJ even I'll
In column wheel, beat from Jahlil
Screaming my mind, but ain't no Johnny I'll
Got it any hard, I pop it any set
I wish a nigga would've put his life to the test
I made it God's grace to say I'm turning late
We're like jaded on my aye, separate make a G
I should go before the sun up, welcome back tutter
Probably fly trotter, fly a litter faller
I'm all about my twat, and there I wanna vet
Stupid say I'm sick, I call it a shack

You can tell I ain't even try to fit in
Probably somewhere you can't even get it
Don't try, we gonna be here for a minute
Tell 'em I ain't leaving till late finish, and

I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Loaded, I'm loaded, four shots in and
I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Loaded, I'm loaded, where should I begin?

Knocking down your door like Avon
Sign niggas, now we ain't playing
Ready to go, tell 'em they don't have to wait on
See me with the prepare hood, niggas they don't have to trade on
Your boy fresh in a dope boy hat
With a pitch of perfect bitch, come and get a codac
I don't need a cosign period cotext
They stop to my house and got a Rolex

You can tell I ain't even try to fit in
Fuck all the politicians in the city
Later on they gonna say a nigga get in
Pocket full of hundreds and I'm feeling like a milli

You can tell I ain't even try to fit in
Probably somewhere you can't even get it
Don't try, we gonna be here for a minute
Tell 'em I ain't leaving till late finish, and

I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Loaded, I'm loaded, four shots in and
I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Loaded, I'm loaded, where should I begin?

I'm in this black air heesy, straight to Givenchy
Gold chains on racks hanging from my pocket
My whole team's winning, losing never was an option
That's why your bitch's here and leaves with her head popping
I be going in, here we go again, ain't got to ask no question, though
Bottles from out that roof, sparkle right on my whole section
Bitch, you know I am out of marley, probably off a tooth
All black, probably killing scenes where youth
Standing in the line while I'm standing on a sofa
Pussy popping like the paparazzi camera when they saw me
Might not see tomorrow, so tonight I tear the shit closer
Part might feel my boy's caps and a glass of more Patron

You can tell I ain't even try to fit in
Probably somewhere you can't even get it
Don't try, we gonna be here for a minute
Tell 'em I ain't leaving till late finish, and

I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Loaded, I'm loaded, four shots in and
I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Loaded, I'm loaded, where should I begin?</pre>
