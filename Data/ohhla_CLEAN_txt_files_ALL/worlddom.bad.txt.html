[Intro: Sample]
Say mate, what do you wanna do tonight?
They same thing we do every night Pinky
Try to take over the world

Who the fuck is this Joey Bada$$ nigga son?

[Hook]
Aye yo who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow?
Point 'em out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic?

Check!

Puffing stramonium underground like pieholes
Look on their flasshole
These bars like writing espressioni
And these folks are for custodians
Homeless man only goldregen do
Risin' at my laptop looking at
Ref on opium truth
They like to throw you in room
I'm like if only you knew
I'm only in school for cosmology
That's why I act as lonely as you
You see I'm wise behind my years and my past
And my voice over the stairs
Is the only way they hear
With a copy on my membrane
But I've been smoking chem strain
So lately I've been having hard times
With remembering
And be patient, my flood is proving
Gipsies ain't shit
'Cause I believe that we could be like Neo in the Matrix
But fuck it I'm a rap it momma likely and adequitly
'Til I drove into static with my slimatic anatomy
And come out into in PD with fugitives at blue prison hill mad is
I've been going roll, this shit's how I feel rappin'
You get y'all serve chapters so I can't even guess this
We taught you how to be proten but still it's acting in messes
Y'all better get back your asses
'Cause we 'bout to annihilate
My empire gate seem the Empire State
I'm on now on your platform
Look at the way they clap for 'em
Never fuck with funny man
'Cause I don't like my back tone
Nigga ain't squat, diss that top
You ain't used too
Keep it neutral, just so you can scoop through
No beef like nunu's
Keep it neutral, just so you can scoop through
I tell 'em
No beef like nunu's
It's world domination, nation
You're tuned in to my station
Always go to do be in the motherfucking anthem
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top
With my fucking world domination, nation
You're tuned in to my station
Always go to do be in the motherfucking anthem
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top
With my fucking team
