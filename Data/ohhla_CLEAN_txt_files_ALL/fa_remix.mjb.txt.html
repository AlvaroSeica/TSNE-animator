[Rap Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
The way I
Let it loose, for real, could only boost, the deal
The bigger the flip
The better it feel
Ladies up shakin'
Doin' they dance
Hands in the air
When Mary drop
It's nothin' but a family affair
Now once you got C.L. poppin', baby, ain't no stoppin'
It's all gravy, once you got the whole hood coppin'
With the queen on my lap
With some new paper, daddy, it's a rap

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Come on, everybody, get on up
Cause you know we gots to get it crunk
Mary J. is in the spot tonight
And I'm a make you feel alright (Make you feel alright)
Come on, baby, just party with me
Let loose and set your body free
Leave your situations at the door
So when you step inside, jump on the floor

Chorus: Mary J. Blige
Let's get it crunk up on it
Fun up on it
In this dancery
We got y'all open
Now you're floatin'
So you gots to dance for me
Don't need no hateration
Holleration
In this dancery
Let's get it perculatin'
While you're waitin'
Soldiers, dance for me

(Verse 2)
[Mary J. Blige] It's only gonna be about a matter of time
                Before you get loose and start to
                Lose your mind
                Cop you a drink, go ahead and rock your ice
                Cause were celebratin' No More Drama in our life
                Get the
[Pete Rock]     Remix
[Mary J. Blige] Pumpin', everybody's jumpin'
                Go ahead and twist your back, and get your body bumpin'
                I told you, leave your situations at the door
                So grab somebody, and get your ass on the dance floor

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
[Mary J. Blige] We, don't need, no haters
                We just tryin' to love, one another
                We just want y'all to have a good time
                No more drama in your life
                Work real hard to make a dime
                If you got beef, your problem, not mine
                Leave all that BS outside
                Then we gonna celebrate all night
                Let's have fun tonight, no fights
                Turn that
[Pete Rock]     Remix
[Mary J. Blige] Way up high
                Making you dance all night and I
                Got some real heat for ya this time
                Doesn't matter if you white or black
                Let's get crunk cause Mary back

[Rap Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
Yo, yo
I'd probably boot these thoroughbreds
And bully the draw, step up in the club, and all they wanna
Start is the biddin' wars
Compared to the young
C.L.
A much more ruthless, more more richer
But it's a family affair
Then I guess I'm just
That much more sicker, cigar blowin', champagne flowin'
Be easy
Like movin' units is nothin' further
That could please me
But how ya marinate my check late
With M.J.B.

Repeat Chorus Four Times
