Album:  Later That Day...
Song:   The Last Trumpet
Typed by: ninjafunk@hotmail.com

Sample: lamentations, lamentations, lamentations worldwide

Watch out (repeated)

LB: 	In the beginning men and women had an obligation to their children
Lateef: Then there was a real and true necessity in need for building
LB: 	There was still the discipline and will proliferate the lineage
Lat: 	Matters of the spirit, mind, and body taken serious
LB:	But the way that we became what we became
      	Somebody please explain
Lat: 	Well we could tell you if you're curious
       	Those that reign got the masses in chains
       	And their minds enslaved
Both: 	And that's the part that makes me furious

Watch out (repeated)

Both: 	Cos they're definitely aint no info readily avai'
      Lable to the general A (?) people so let me know x2

Lat: 	It's easily this multimedia crews that feed you to the neediest
      It's the greediest trying to cheat us out of our God given right
LB: 	To a quality education minimal opportunities available
      Limited occupations we are not given a choice
Lat: 	Or given a voice within a political system pimped and gangsta'd out
      Wherein the people are the victim sheep being lead about
LB: 	While the followers and the patrons of any faith outside the mainstream
      Are being raided, falsely painted as endangering the way things work
Lat:	And the way things are remain
LB:	I can't believe that things aint worse
Lat: 	When all the wicked seeds we've sown have grown
LB:  	And poisoned all the Earth
Lat: 	It serves us right
LB: 	Can't really act surprised when the harvest has no worth
Lat: 	The curse that's lurking round the corner
Both: 	Is the product of our work

Watch out (repeated)

Right now
LB: 	The holy war's growing opposing forces polling of the origins
      Of which have been historically been ignored
Right now
Lat: 	Our foreign policy is mallets of democracy
      Upholding an aristocracy of secret terrorist cells
Right now
LB: 	The global poverty that we accept so commonly
      Turns people into property one step away from hell
Right now
Lat: 	Healthcare battles bioengineering for the worldwide scare
      Of the plague the we're fearing
Right now
LB: 	They got the right to put our lives under surveillance
Right now
Lat: 	They got the right to lock us up we don't obey them
Right now
LB: 	Modern education don't prepare the youth
Right now
Right now
Both: 	Do what you gotta do
Right now
LB: 	There's people shooting at people that's throwing stones
Right now
Lat: 	There's a movement of people across the globe
Right now
Both:	Right now is where we're at
      What goes around comes around
      Time for action before the last trumpet sounds
