I feel like ridin
(This is for my nigga: Payback)
Somebody took my nigga
I feel like goin' to war
Goin' to war
Goin' to war

[VERSE ONE]
All I think about is the love that you had for the game
We get into with some niggas, you wasn't the first to bang
Don't know how bad I wanted to you see you with yo' riches and thangs
Hit yo' switches in your '94 Lincoln on Dana Danes
I'm in the back seat of the Monte Carlo sittin on stuff
Dreamin about the double my lick, it got me y'all fucked up
Puffin' a blunt, shit, I grab my gat, spray shit up
Somebody responsible, where yo' homie at? That started that stuff
This nigga deserve to have his bitch-ass touched
That's on the real, I'm shedin' tears
Knowin this is the last year we kicked it
I was addicted to the way that you would spit yo' flow
These niggas in the game is lucky, homie, they just don't know
To think that we would lose a link so soon
It never crossed my mind 
that every day we livin' from the sun to the moon
But you won't that darkness hold us down
So all the sparks is blood now
As I vision yo' face up in the clouds, rest in peace

Chorus:

If you feelin' like we feelin' now
Stuck in the rain while it's pouring down
Thinking 'bout my homie, where the time goes
Wish you never would have left us but that's selfish, though
For real...

[YOUNG PROD]
Sittin' on the porch, blazin' blunts I see yo' face
Comin' through the gate I swear to God I saw it today
My heart beatin fast, you lookin' like you comin' my way
It playback in my dome cause I can't let you stray
I'm your dog, you my Loc and that's forever, sho'
I get that tat, I show you that, watch, we gon' blow
I hit the Hen for you, thinkin' sin for you
But I know you want a nigga to win, spend some ends for you
But the waterfalls in my eyes don't lie
The waterfalls in my eyes don't dry, you my nigga
You got yo' wings now, no more nicotine now
No more blackin out, no more talk rowd'
Now thou shall disrespect Payback
The resurrection-like comeback
But the Lord'll make you devil niggas lay flat, uh huh
For the love of this my nigga shall ????? like what
Payback rest in peace, never mentally deceased, we love you

Chorus...

[HAVOC]
I can't believe my nigga Payback...(Payback)
Shot over some bullshit, man (fuckin' bullshit)
The shit is gonna affect for us a long muthafuckin time (Full Clipp)
Rest in peace homie

[PRODEJE]
Pour the liquor for they loved ones
I give it all for my loved ones
Won't let the world forget where you came from
The Full Clippers - we all shedin' tears
We all wish to God you was here
But since you passed we feel we gots to still smash
For real, mash on these niggas with the scrutiny flows, we all ask
Why the hell it had to happen to us?
Why this nigga had to bust?
Turned the homie to dust and still live
And it's nothin that we wouldn't give
I can't believe I lost a G
Before we got in the game, I feel a chill
In my heart still, whatever we do
It playin' a part still 
We still split that mill with your moms, it's all real

Chorus... </pre>
