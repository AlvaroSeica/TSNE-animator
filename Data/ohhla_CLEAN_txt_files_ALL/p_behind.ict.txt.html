[Intro: Ice-T Talking]
Yo, shut up this is Ice motherfuckin' T
and I've been listenin' to a lot of DJ's
get on the Mic and try to get busy you know what I'm sayin'?
But can't no DJ get rap like my motherfuckin' nigga Evil-E
So right about now I'm give you the motherfuckin' microphone
I'ma get behind the wheels, and we gonna do this
yo Evil, tell where the fuck it's comin' from

[Verse 1: Evil-E]
It's comin' from the mouth of the pimp behind the wheels
I make the bitch kneel, Evil E the Great steel
Shows, hoes, junior pimp, sweat out punk
So I can give your bitch, the Evil-E junk
I love your honey if she listen up, listen clear after the show
Yo, hoe hit the wheel "yeah"
backstage, pad lipstick, tattooed on the right tip
My hope to get lit, grap that ass and hit "hit"
hard move and more security would be knockin'
while Evil E's rockin', Charlie Jam is gyratin'
I'm a fuckin' mack that comes up, by playin' them back
ask my nigga, I be Shawnie, Shawnie, Shawnie mack...

[Chorus]
E cuts the records and the yellow nigga gets loose
E cuts the records and the yellow nigga gets loose
