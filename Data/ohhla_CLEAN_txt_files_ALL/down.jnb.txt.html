Girl it's alright babe
  are you still down for me now?
cause it's there in your eyes yea
  are you still down for me?
I can see that you want me
  are you still down for me now?
by the way that you smile
  yea are you still down for me?
Left once again at home, another night your home
Ain't no fun if in love not at home alone
How's it feel to be useless, all night, tell me
Can you recall how we use to be there
Can't use to remember those feeling again
Seem like everytime I see you there's a tear in your eye
What you cryin for? Time to make a decision or go dyin inside

Tell em all, call me fool but I'm stuck
It's a love thang, plus I'm overheatin from the rush
Times have touch, get ya feeling fireworks we watch the sky
I'll make you smile but you'd rather have what makes you cry
Say goodbye and I'll leave now
With my heart on my sleeve, memories down
What I found is you still care
You had feeling and they still there
Baby girl keep it real - are you still down?

Girl it's alright babe
  Come on are you still down?
cause it's there in your eyes yea, it's in your eyes 
I can see it in your eyes
  Are you still down?
I can see that you want me
Don'tcha want me don'tcha want me
  Are you still down?
by the way that you smile, hahaha yea
  Are you still down for me?
Remember that evening
  Yea are you still down?
I know that you were too scared to go all the way, please
but you did it to please me
Crying it was raining when you gave it to me
The more I see the more I feel inside
And I know one thing I'll make it back to where you can fly
Watch the time go
Don't cry tomorrow is a better day
What cha cryin for? Let me dry your eyes
Think you burnin out...

Only once in a lifetime, touch my soul
So slow babe boo, don't rush the flow
Got me all weak baby but I'm strong apart
With more bounce to the ounce with the longest parts
Get me mined like fine wine measured in time
Maybe the other brothers loved you but the pleasure was mine
Mama taught me how to love a woman properly sprung
We committed so I hit it and it's properly done

Girl it's alright babe
  Come on, are you still down?
cause it's there in your eyes yea
It's in your eyes I can see it in your eyes
  Are you still down?
I can see that you want me
Don'tcha want me don'tcha want me
  Are you still down?
By the way that you smile, hahaha yea 
  Are you still down for me?

Girl it's alright babe
  Come on, are you still down for me now?
cause it's there in your eyes yea
It in your eyes I can see it in your eyes
  Are you still down?
I can see that you want me
  She want you Jon she want you
  Are you still down?
By the way that you smile
  She got smile look...

Baby are you still down,
are you down for me?
Baby are you still down,
Still down for me!
(Repeat till end)
