Typed by: lachlan.jones@gmail.com

[Chorus]
I just want to live my life right
Rise above this world you created
I just want to reach the limelight
Shining bright before my colours have faded
I just want to keep my eye sight
See my futures path illuminated
I got the potential, I got the credentials
Just slip this disc in your playlist

[Intro]
Let's keep it moving, I wanna see some bodies moving
Move, move, yo yo

[Verse One]
Is you keeping it trill, speaking it real random
Last years laughing stock droppin this years anthem
Tandom bungee jump and drop on the beat
No gold chains and no cocking glocks on the street
Just braggadacio, out to smash the status quo
Activate a flow for sure to captivate a show
Oh, I can see some hands raised
That's in bad taste I gets no love from my fanbase
While you handshaking macking on models
Standing backstage I'm the alleycat cracking a bottle
You know what's up, cypher while we roll a blunt
Boaconstrict emcees, please I leave them in a cobra clutch
Since my homie Muph spat his rap balads
I wore my pants low just to match my bank balance
I'm darker than Eminem but lighter than Tupac
I'll be writing these new raps until white is the new black
Applying them to wax so DJs won't spin them
Fuck you and the major label cheque you rode in on
I loves the disco plus I loves the nightlife
But at the end of the day I just want to live my life right

[Chorus]
I just want to live my life right
Rise above this world you created
I just want to reach the limelight
Shining bright before my colours have faded
I just want to keep my eye sight
See my futures path illuminated
I got the potential, I got the credentials
Just slip this disc in your playlist

[Verse Two]
Slip this disc in your playlist, Hykizzle is nameless
No pyrotechnics or dancing women with facelifts
Sh-sh-shapeshift, the human hologram
The common man mistook the ghetto for the promised land
I'm making a scene, busy making a scene
Making American music living Australian dreams
Jeans frayed at the seems, drinking overproof
I stay crunk without the make up and photoshoots
This is owed to you, the few peeping my stageshow
Tearin new a-holes to this beat by Styalz Fuego
Ayo, you can't eff with the mindstate
New Era thinking cap tilted sideways
One mic, one love, one dream
But they pigeon hole my rap songs as Crooked Unseen
You looking Dundee in your chains and your bling
Like, these are a few of my favourite things
Blazing ism, slaying rhythms off the drum track
You glorify your poster boys with a thumb tack
Fuck that, I stand in shadows of the limelight
I make moves, pay dues and always live my life right

[Chorus]
I just want to live my life right
Rise above this world you created
I just want to reach the limelight
Shining bright before my colours have faded
I just want to keep my eye sight
See my futures path illuminated
I got the potential, I got the credentials
Just slip this disc in your playlist

[Outro]
Raise your drink waive it side to side
Raise your spliff waive it side to side
Raise your girl waive her side to side
I loves the nightlife</pre>
