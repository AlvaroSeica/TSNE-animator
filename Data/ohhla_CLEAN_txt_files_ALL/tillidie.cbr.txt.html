[Chris Brown]
Yo~!
This Virginia; straight from the country right there wit my kinfolk
Golds in my mouth, and they put 26's on Benzos
Dirt roads, back woods, they got weed but I've been dope
Ratchet, nigga we act hood, but I'm gettin money with these white folk
Sippin and I'm faded, super medicated
Said she wanna check the pole, I said okay Sarah Palin
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, so I lay down and lay in
A nigga gon' be faded, all the way to the AM
(Uhh, whoa, shit, okay)

[Chorus]
More drink, po' it up; more weed, roll it up
Whoa there hoe, you know whassup
Quit hoggin the blunt bitch, slow down, pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down, damn bitch I do it
And this the life we chose
Workin all night, swear I'm never goin broke, broke
And I'ma do this till I die
And I ain't talking shit just cause I'm
Just cause I'm (I'm high)

(Oh God, oh God)

[Big Sean]
Okay wow bow, look at me now
Chief like a indian, talkin in clouds
I'm high as a bitch, I'm talkin to clouds
Off tree every night like I roam with the owls
I super soak that hoe, show 'em no love just throw 'em a towel
Still rockin Louis Vuitton condoms, cause I'm so fuckin in style
Wow~! New crib, crash that, drove here, cab back
Now knock that pussy out, yeah that's just a litl' catnap
Hold up, hold up whoa, don't be smokin my shit
I be smokin that fire, and she be smokin my dick
Be smokin my dick you lil' bitch
(Whoa, hey, okay)

[Chorus]

(Yeah) {*laughter*}

[Wiz Khalifa]
Smokin chokin always rollin somethin
I don't need a key to start my car bitch I just push a button
Did a show got a half a mill' and spent it like it's nothin
Money flowin, never sober, smokin 'til I got concussions, no discussion
Man I got a condo and got a big crib, pounds all over my kitchen is
If I ain't on the road gettin it then I'm in the hood where my niggaz live
Did a tour, sold it out, just bought a pound 'bout to finish it
Now all my pasta got shrimp in it, you talk about it I'm livin it
Fuckin little bitch {*laughter*}
(Whoa, okay)

[Chorus]

[Chris Brown]
Real nigga never frontin
Cause when you got it all e'rybody want somethin
Middle finger in the air no fist pumpin
And me Sean and Wiz got this bitch jumpin
Hah! Finally got this bitch jumpin
Got this bitch jumpin
Fly... that's me
Ha ha ha ha~!</pre>
