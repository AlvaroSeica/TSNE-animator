Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook - 2x]
This some mob shit nigga, no marks allowed
Disturbing a nigga block, cause the trunks is loud
20 inches of vogue tires, chunking the deuce
Me and my niggaz we flipping Benzes, minus the roof

[Buddah Man]
Disturbing a nigga block, cause the trunks is loud
Five swangas on my load, moving marks aside
Put the heat to the ocra, and spark my fire
22's when I valet, and park my ride
I told Frost and T-Pop, it's some marks outside
My big niggaz down to box, till it's dark outside
That nigga saying why the fuck, I even parked outside
I leave the bitch niggaz lined up, in chalk outside
If these haters got beef, I unleash my heater
I'm a vault force feeder, glock nine repeater
I'm the youngest kingpin, to ever come to the Penn
Before you let off one, you getting touched with ten
And before you get up, nigga you get touched again
With fo' clips and hollow tips, that touch your chin
Fucking with me, nigga your wig get peeled back
Said that meant that, represent that

[Hook - 2x]

[T-Pop]
I done cut off the top, to my Humvee
2003, slipping packing to my B.G.
Now these hoes steady be jocking, niggaz steady be knocking me
Laf-Tex affiliated, so ain't no way they stopping it
Plus, we hogging the game
Like my nigga Chalie Boy, we off the chain
Maintain and bleed blocks, all day
Everyday it don't stop, giving shots
Out to my nigga, on the blizzock
I know it's hard in the ghetto, but you gon reach the tizzop
And one day, you gon shine
And if it takes robbing, then cock that nine cock that nine

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Bub]
I disturb niggaz blocks, that's all I know
Mob with day one niggaz, cause I know they fa sho
Befo' I cock the fifth, bullets spit in the fo's
This is money in the pot, or I'm copping all snow
Whoa, they ain't ready for Bub to start tripping
Slide the clip in the K, blood'll start dripping
Roll or get rolled over, so make your decision
'Fore the beam on the Smith-N, get to turn boys vision
Hard to explain, all the pain I been through
On one bleeding blocks, cause the rent's still due
One deep in a Denali, blowing doja when I come through
Buddah right behind me, acting bad in that H2

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Tantrum]
This some mob shit nigga, no marks allowed
Disturbing a nigga block, cause the trunks is loud
20 inches on vogue tires, chunking the deuce
Me and my niggaz flipping in Benzes, minus the roof

We mobbing, through
We mobbing, ooooh
We mobbing, ooooh
We mobbing, ooooh-oooh</pre>
