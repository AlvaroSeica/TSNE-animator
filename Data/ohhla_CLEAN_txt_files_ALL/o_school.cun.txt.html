[Deacon the Villain]
Before R. Kelly had his teens.. Wutang had their cream
Slick Rick had his rings... crack rock had it's fiends
Martin Luther had his dreams, Stevie Wonder could sing
or Elvis was king, Hip Hop was on the scene

[Kno]
Nah meeeeen, go back like Hitchcocks' hairline
Taught Fred Estaire how to pop lock in my spare time
I caught a ride on Noah's ark, cus I had a pair of Puma's
and two chickens on my arm

[Deacon the Villain]
That's true...... and when I came through
noticed Noah was first to "check 1, check 2"

[Kno]
Guess who rescued Repunzel
climbing up her gold weave, then made her braid her hair like Alicia Keys

[SOS]
Before EPMD met golddiggers fuckin for VISAs
I was the first to pimp Jezebel and Mona Lisa
and made em famous way before Eminem could flow
Even ran trizz with JFK on Marilyn Monroe...Oh

[Chorus] - scratching
"Blow the spot with some old school shit" - Rah Digga on Talib Kweli's "Down For The Count"
"I'm so old school"- Jay-Z off of "Jigga That Nigga"
"I'm old school like my dad is"- J-Ro on De La Soul's "My Writes"
"True, that's old school"- Mos Def on BlackStarr's "Very Well"
"I'll bust that old school boom bap all over this map"- Declaime on Lootpacks's "Episodes" (x2)
"From the old school I consider loyally true"

[SOS]
I'm so old school I was at the first supper serving soulfood
And Arroz con Pollo', but I bet you had no clue
That pilgrims were the first to name women after produce
And that was the first Road Rules without toll booths
Even when Adam and Eve sat by the weed tree
I told Eve, "Please don't tell him touch my weed leaves."
But after I showed him Cypress Hill, he loved fire
Then Eve left and became the first lady of Ruff Riders

[Deacon the Villain]
Had a horse carraige, sittin' on dubs, coastin'
Smacked the thouroughbred in the ass and hit the 3-wheel motion
Since a Frank and Jesse James shoot-out in the street
Had a scoundrel c-walkin', shootin' bullets at his feet

[Kno]
I had Michalangelo put down the horsehair brushes
Started doing end to end burners on buses
Trust this, put King Midas' touch to use
He grabbed my bead necklace now I'm rockin truck jewels

[Deacon the Villain]
When lightin' struck Ben Frank's kite and sent currents through
He was the first to electric boogaloo
The wop, robot and helicopter on the pavement
And in amazement, he was even Harlem-Shakin'

[Chorus] - scratching
"Blow the spot with some old school shit" - Rah Digga on Talib Kweli's "Down For The Count"
"I'm so old school"- Jay-Z off of "Jigga That Nigga"
"I'm old school like my dad is"- J-Ro on De La Soul's "My Writes"
"True, that's old school"- Mos Def on BlackStarr's "Very Well"
"I'll bust that old school boom bap all over this map"- Declaime on Lootpacks's "Episodes" (x2)
"From the old school I consider loyally true"- Big Pun off of "You Came Up"

[Deacon the Villain]
Transylvania was flossed out... but the facts have changed
Like, me selling Dracula some platinum caps for his fangs
Throwing daisy dukes upon that Mary Magdeline dame
And she ran game, tricked me up out my platinum chain

[SOS]
I had American Indians sending smoke signals with hydro
Giving villages contact matching blunts with Tonto
Spellin S.O.S. with my eyes closed
Even battled Henry the Eighth with my rhyme flow
and made his wives my hoes

[Kno]
I told Jesus that GZA said sandles were feminine
So he copped some shelltoes and suede Timberlands
Remember when KRS ripped Shan? Do ya homework
That was Amadeus playing the Bridge Is Over

[SOS]
Moses parted two tables with a mixer and played great
With his DJ crates. Before him, we played tapes
I sipped fine wine with Einstein back in the days
M. C. Square was his stage name and he rocked gray braids

[Deacon the Villain]
That was before we could sit and play, Kid N Play
Or Nefertiti rocked the first flat-top fade
but anyway... flip through ya history books
you'll see about a thousand pictures of these infamous crooks
Cunninlynguists!!
