We knew this moment would come
Yeah, we knew this moment would come
Ha, no use trying to hold it off

[K-Rino]
I morph into a arrow from a crossbow, forego your torso
And throw myself at the compartment, where your thoughts grow
Cardio blows, kill your heart slow
Compose decades of raw flow, but lost no skill over the course though
My tongue got four blades, like a quatro
When it sparks in war mode, it also like a dog swollen from parvo
I bark so hard, my own jaw broke
I host a talk show, and narcissistic marks get roasted in the dark smoke
My speech shots, like a hot grease pop
The leash drops secretes enough heat, to leave potholes in the street top
A hundred years later, the heat stops
To properly clean up what leaks out, you need a thousand square feet mop
Now I'm smoking brains, over open flames steam
And I'm throwing pain beams, that make nova cane scream
I'm lynching em, with the throw speed of Lincecum
And in the inter rum, no one's allowed to even think vision or mention him
When I don't have a mic device to flow on
My spawn robotic protons, let me remove my whole arm like Voltron
Then hard as granite, my hand gets
My fist becomes expansive, I speak through it and rapid vocals transmit
From marvel syntax damn it, I ran it
When the entherial telephone is ringing, I span planets to answer it
Soon as you make a mad try, to be a bad guy
I'ma pass by snatch and hide, you inside of a flash drive
Known to speak fast, as gazelle feet
While you release words that excrete, the kinda discharge a snail leaks
Rain hail sleet I scale beats, and reach rocket propelled peaks
You can't see me, but you feel me like brail sheets
Moving with the force of a whale fleet, I swell cheeks for twelve weeks
My tongue punctures lungs, deeper than nail cleats
Over elite teaches I prevail sweet, completely delete
And keep you between the border, where heaven and hell meet
Methods extend, far beyond the weapons of men
The heat pressure my rap sheet registers, measures at ten
Hidden messages, within my word lessons again
Skill kills, anytime you put the S at the end
Nonetheless I'm the professor, who invented the test
My consciousness got much compressed, into a minute or less
Happy to say, that you're a cast away captive of K
Kidnap tomorrow, so you're eternally trapped in today
And time flies, so I mixed and made it hard to surmise
So an hour from now, won't even be there when you arrive
I misdirect seconds, with chronologic evil effects
You'll have to rewind the time, to find week after next
Know that it's threats, then I exploded like loaded techs
Holes in the solar plex, his stomach turns like a roll-a-dex
And then my throat injects, a mainstream artist was smoking gain green
Is so supreme, it left a growth on him long as a plane's wing
Your back is dropped, over the top of some jagged rocks
These average flocks watch me like Magnavox, as I shatter blocks and ravage spots
Arrow bot, who's so past the top I piss on astronauts
With massive shots, I'm like two surgeons I'm a pair of doc's
The more rotten rappers plot, the worse my habit got
And oxygen is no longer a option, when the cabin locks
I stare at dots till my hair is hot, one of my savage plots
Will have you knocked soft, as a fabric washed bag of socks
I rock a beat till the cops retreat, known to block the street
Drop some heat, even with taser guns shocking me
I'm obviously elite, you can not compete
Shouted my topics deep into the night, when I finish writing the clock asleep
My jabs'll greatly decapitate, what use to be a rapper's face
Now only a neck, under a massive space
I'm a half erased, basket case
Once my style's gas replaced, they leave a ninety eight day after taste
I multiply bars, for more rhymes
See when I design em, I write every line differently four times
My intellectual home, is a terror zone
My baritone is known, to circulate strong psychedelic pheromones
I shoot free throws with globes, and bowl strikes with frontal lobes
Compose and make a hundred roll scholars, look like one year olds
Stunning flows I own a ton of those, right handed atomic blows
Medics don't know, how to keep holes in his stomach closed
To grasp my ideas, take five years
My senses work in reciprocity, so my ears see and my eyes hear
So twisted, that even love hated me
I insatiably ate for weeks, I'm so crazy that bravery's afraid of me
Barricade yourself, in the back of your house
And I'll be reaching through the keyhole, and snatching you out
My multiple styles, left him so toxified his throat fried
The planet's diameter, I was standing on both sides
No surprise, that I go harder than most guys
And flow until each life is, and won't stop until his ghost dies
The super speed, letter monster
I'm reading aloud, fifty thousand words a minute on a teleprompter
Dominate and still preponderant, once the sun was lit
I lunged a ton of spit, and encompassed it for the fun of it
Nonsense, not a honest accomplishment
The velocity I'm coming with, so prominent the speed I woulda vomited
Never seeking the glamour, I get deep in the grammar
Slam my words into your face, like the teeth of a hammer
And regardless if your cars are cleaner, my eternal bars are meaner
Scar you in a large arena, somewhere out in Argentina
I walk a path between pacifist, and acid fiend
Blast you with gasoline, film it and watch it on a plasma screen
My writing passed supreme, flow tactics are baffling
He last was seen, a mile from Abilene in a vast ravine
I watch these known cats, recycle and clone raps
I architected hard digital dome slap, phone apps
Slaughter every name, on my rhyme list
Explosives and a dozen roses, guess you could say I killed him with kindness

(*talking*)
Yeah, see see what you made me do
Look what you made me do, now clean it up ha-ha</pre>
