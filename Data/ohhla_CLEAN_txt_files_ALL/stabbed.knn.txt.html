Song:   I Was Stabbed by Satan
Typed by: Cabdi01@gmail.com

one two, one one two

[Chorus]
I was stabbed by satan, on the day that I was born
I was promised lovin', but instead I was torn
la la la, la la la, My heart bled tears
la la la, la la la, My eyes shed tears

[Verse 1]
A poor black ghetto child
he can't shoot and he can't go run a mile
there's no school and the kids go runnin wild
the police and the courts wanna run 'em out
he's so ?? and the police hate 'em all
he ain't seen his daddy since back in '84
but oh well so it be now he's in jail
his mother's stressin just to get him out on bail
let's sing it out

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And the story goes on
there's no glory and the worry takes a toll on
his own body but his buddies wanna roll on
It's all bloody when the car comes to a stop
the police with the big glocks pull 'em out
they say freeze but there's only one one comin out
there's two dead with a legal gun to his head
It's stupid, he shoulda played ball instead

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So one day when it's all said and done
my life will be the bluest rap song ever sung
my verses will be curses to the rich
and all sorts of authority will cease to exist
my daughters will be free of war ???
raisin they aim in the silence of revolution my face will appear
Like the vision of a prisoner with his last bed
this song is a poem and the whole poem is a tear
drop to no ear

[Chorus]</pre>
