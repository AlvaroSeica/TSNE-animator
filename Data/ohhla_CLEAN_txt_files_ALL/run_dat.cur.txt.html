Song:   Run Dat Shit
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
When I'm off in the zone my niggas tellin me run dat shit
Run dat shit
Run dat shit
When I'm off in the zone my niggas tellin me

[Verse 1]
Shit for high priced SUVs
Long nights palm trees
Cuff link sleeves
Them niggas ain't these
Extraordinary gentleman
This is the league
Wrinkle free
Pimpin my stocks crate like 915
Jet cole make watergate look like a hair-brain scheme
Your hoes wanna be taken no leaving this [?]
And on the scene
Blue waters
White sands
Sticky green
Enough niggas talk shit
Jet niggas talk rich
Porches, fortress, horses afford this
Then try step up
Ya'll got me messed up
Basketball shorts on red carpet
My girl dressed up, and I'm coolin
I'm just at the premier cause my homeboy was in the movie
I would be hoopin on my front yard point guard shit
With my neighbors son OG shit I do cause I truly am one

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And they still trying to build that case
Want me to pay for murdering all these tapes
What can I say it's still money over bitches
We stick to the script here
Magazine pictures
Credit every stitch that I wear
Never been one of those caught up in the fab
They say it's out of style
I bring that shit back
Designers know it makes sense to chop it and burn hash
And let me skim through their next season sketch pad
I'm never mad
Just mad high my guy
From this altitude you wipe a doves tears when they cry
The forefather of the fly
No paternity test your style got my eyes left
And it's Jets til the motherfucking next
Life
So sweet candy stripes on my Vette
If I say it I show it
You think I get it for free how I smoke it
My dude wanted loot but he tossed me a few free O's and shit
All these rappers need is a hook to go and fish
For crappy deals but I'm way too real
Muthafuckas kept half assing until
Warner Bros. came to the table
With the table
Now there's room for my whole set
Now my niggas able
Eat til we got the itis
Bitch we on fire
Marlo on the screen yeah bitch we on the wire
You talking too much bitch go sit up there with the driver</pre>
