Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Live your life, live your life
In the zone, in the zone
Live your life, live your life
In the zone, in the zone
Live your life, live your life
In the zone, in the zone
Live your life, live your life
In the zone, in the zone

Cameras off, not be soft
I'm a do it like a boss tonight, tonight
Empty glass not allowed, bottom out my account tonight, alright

We can run into the night, anything you like
Like lovers do
Party for your life, it could end tonight
Like lovers do

Why do you go out if you're not dancing?
Get up out my way 'cause it's on time
We don't give a... if you don't join in
Cause we got freedom
I got freedom

Raise your hands
Throw them up
Show them we don't give a what
Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life

Celebrate in that place
Party way into the day!
Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life
Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life
In your zone, in the zone

Leave me alone in the zone
Clear the throne, I'm a queen tonight, tonight
Let be them brain go insane like the party keep you payin tonight, alright

We can run into the night, anything you like
Like lovers do
Party for your life, it could end tonight
Like lovers do

Why do you go out if you're not dancing?
Get up out my way 'cause it's on time
We don't give a... if you don't join in
Cause we got freedom
I got freedom

Raise your hands
Throw them up
Show them we don't give a what
Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life

Celebrate in that place
Party way into the day!
Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life

If you wanna be free (if you wanna go and get it)
If love is all you need (if you wanna go and get it)
If you wanna live your dream (if you wanna go and get it)
And be all that you can be (if you wanna go and get it)

Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life
(Go and get it, if you wanna go and get it)
(If you wanna go and get it)
Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life
Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life life life..

Why do you go out if you're not dancing?
Get up out my way 'cause it's on time
We don't give a... if you don't join in
Cause we got freedom
I got freedom

Raise your hands
Throw them up
Show them we don't give a what
Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life

Celebrate in that place
Party way into the day!
Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life

Raise your hands
Throw them up
Show them we don't give a what
Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life

Celebrate in that place
Party way into the day!
Live your life life, live your live your life, live your life</pre>
