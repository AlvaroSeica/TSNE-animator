Woke up in the morning, threw on my black suit
Time to pay respects to a player from my crew
He got caught up and paid with his life
Slipping on the block on the late night
Now everybody's at his funeral with tears in their eyes
Wonder why my homie had to die
Just another one of my dead friends
And all that's on my mind is getting revenge
Kissed my playa on his cheek
And whispered in his ear "I love you and rest in peace"
But for me, the funk is on
I'm strapped with my chrome from dusk til dawn
And you can run but you can't hide, fell me?
So when you get your first glance, you'd best to kill me
Cause I'm out to gets you, pranksta
And you know you can't fade a gangsta

They try to tell me revenge is the wrong way
But that ain't what my comrades would say
And if it was Pooh, laying in the casket
Somebody would be getting they punk ass blasted
I'm riding strapped in the LTD
Ready to put some punks to sleep
Tears filled Antione's eyes
As he thinks of the way my homie died
AK's across my lap
And it's on with the mini 14 in the back
The Angel of Death's on a mission
I want your life nigga, fuck sqaushing shit
And as far as the toll goes
Nigga you can talk to these motherfucking bullet holes
Now the deuce is out to hang ya
And we ain't shit but gangstas

Now we know for sure who pulled the trigga
Fake-ass nigga
So we kicked in his mom's door at home
And find her old ass there all alone
She gave up his number and all
So I gave his mark ass a call
Look punk, we got your momma
And she'll be dead on arrival if you don't cut the drama
You killed my partner so I gots to kill you
And I'm a do what I have to
This wrinkled-up bitch, you'll find her in a ditch
If your ass don't get here quick
I'm getting tired of your drama
Now ask yourself nigga, do you love your momma?
Cause she's abouts to die, pranksta
Cause that's what you get when you fucks with a gangsta</pre>
