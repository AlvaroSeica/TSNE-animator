[Chorus - Young Scooter]
Money, money, money, money
20âs, 50âs, hundreds
Money, money, money, money
We working them trenches
In my neighborhood
Everything all good
Everybody get in touch
Money, money, money, money
20âs, 50âs, hundreds
Money, money, money, money

[Verse]
A thousand, bricks
Hector, he keep it coming
Every day I cap a hundred
Thousand, nigga
Iâm getting money
So itâs no more serving junkies
Thinking bout that half a mill, I drew it out the carcass
Real shit, no lie, just me and a couple junkies
That 4-4 shit have a nigga money hungry
Keep 100 thousand on me
To blow it with my homie

[Chorus]
Money, money, money, money
20âs, 50âs, hundreds
Money, money, money, money
We working them trenches
In my neighborhood
Everything all good
Everybody get in touch
Money, money, money, money
20âs, 50âs, hundreds
Money, money, money, money

[Verse]
Taylor, Gang
Nigga I rep that over everything
See me I live life in the fast lane
Nigga Iâm taking shots, smoking Mary Jane
Donât need security, I got my own guns
Keep Forgiato rims on all my old schools
Ainât talking shit, boy Iâm talking money
Khalifa, throwing hundreds
Fuck thirsty, them bitches hungry for this

[Chorus]
Money, money, money, money
20âs, 50âs, hundreds
Money, money, money, money
We working them trenches
In my neighborhood
Everything all good
Everybody get in touch
Money, money, money, money
20âs, 50âs, hundreds
Money, money, money, money

[Verse]
Money, I wanna marry you
You know I really need you
Remember that day you left me
I couldnât believe it
Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldnât think
I couldnât do shit without you
But them birds up under that sink
Stretch 'em out, thatâs what Young Scooter do
Every hundred pack I get I bury bout a brick or two
Thatâs just for the drop
Whatever I get, that shit get ran through
Drugs in the south, I made drugs out west too
Take a chance for that paper, thatâs what money do

[Chorus]
Money, money, money, money
20âs, 50âs, hunnits
Money, money, money, money</pre>
