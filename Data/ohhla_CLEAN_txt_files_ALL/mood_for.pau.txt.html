[Newkirk - singing]
There I go, there I go, there I go, therrrrre I gooooooooo
Pretty baby you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me, crazy music
Music that keeps calling me so, very close to you
Turns me a slave
Come and do with me any little thing you want to
Anything baby just let me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above, you're in the clear blue sky
How I worry about you
Just can't live my life without you, baby come here
Don't have NO fear, ohhh is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

[Newkirk - singing]
This little dream might fade away
There ago I'm talking out of my head again
Oh baby won't you come and put our, two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
I'm not afraiiiiiiid, I'm not afraiiiiiiid
If there's a cloud up above us, go on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together can endure a hurricane
Oh my baby, won't you please let me love you
And give you relief from this awful misery

[girl - singing]
What is all this talk, about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore
Not like before, don't you understand me?
Won't you please pull yourself, together, do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweeeeet

[Sweet Dee]
Uhh, I'm lovin you from the first look
Like Mobb Deep, you got me all shook, uhh

[Breeze]
Yeah, your love is real good honey
It even feels better cause I didn't pay money

[Newkirk - singing]
Ohhhhhh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that, new promised laaand
And maybe there, we can find
A cool place to keep our lovin state of mind
I'm so tired of being without love, never knowing what love is about
Hey Mr. Houston you come on in man and you can cut now
if you want to we're through....</pre>
