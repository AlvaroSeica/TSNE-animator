[MF Doom]
He moves the crowd like a cursor on Doom
No curse words, Doom the worst church nerd verse heard
Appeared blurred to a million true believers
Here's the supervillain armed dealer to the divas
Catch, amongst other world scandals
Butter pearl handles to match your girl's sandals
Plan was hatched by a pack of old vandals
Who flag was a black and gold patch with bloody anvils
"Hit 'Em to the Head" was the motto
And one more time to make sure them dead, BLAKKO
When you throw blows in a knife fight Paco
That's how it goes in this +Modern Life+ like +Rocko+
Clock dough 24-7 cycle
When it comes to flows he got more than a mic full
Pull a broad like a dyke bull on a long bid
You're messin with the wrong kids Michael
... it ain't Jack-son
For him to flip scripts like camera, action
Villain! Grew up by the laws of attraction
For future generation's information - the black one
... Move the crowd like a buddha cloud
The purple, puff puff pass 'round the circle
A jerk well renowned for his work skill
He's out, the proof is the computer's down Urkel
MC a show via wi-fi
And tag rate before we wrap it up like tie-dye
Hip-Hop sci-fi you can see hand to eye
Or can Tiger do the Mask like the Fry Guy
Just met a baby home make dome
Check lefts some folks ancestor home wreck
With blown backs these lesser known facts thwart evil
You got no reason, like short people
No offense, the street was burnt brass
Whenever he walked on the street it turned glass
On his lucky rat's paw in the crap drawer
All the world's a stage, where's the trap door, slackjaw
Logic, to keep your mind in the project
Drop the check, his job is to chop neck
That's just payback for nose there's no psych though
What they don't know like Bo
Won't hurt Diddley squat
Got to be kiddin me, not
Seriously plot, to put a hit out on the G-spot
Gypped like oozin out the kettles in they teapot</pre>
