[C-Rayz Walz]
Yeah!  (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah..)

I got flavor like Adobo, you ain't know though?
My rap go back like quack delioso{?}
Señorita, señorita - TEACHER!
What'chu gon' teach us, except to be weaker?
You go bo-bo, I go BO-BO-BO!
BO! BO!  Like Jamaicans at a gun show
Where you from loc', actin tough like gung ho
Pull the gun like bums now - COME OUT YOUR CLOTHES YO
What'chu think the flo' is fo'?
So you can fall when I throw blows
C-Rayz, you ain't know I'ma pro?
My style is rough canvas, a-rhythematic
Flippin the script, now your chick, want a sip of the tip
Tell her chill, I'm celibate kid
Remember my name - like the elephants did
Shake the place, 'til I break your face
Or you can catch a DDT like Jake the Snake, c'mon

[Chorus]
If you love it say yeah - YEAH, yeah yeah yeah
If you need it say yeah - YEAH, yeah yeah yeah
If you got it say yeah - YEAH, yeah yeah yeah
If you want it say yeah - YEAHHH..

Live from New York like +Saturday Night+
In the Bing with a mic, I bling when I write
Yeah, in a battle better come equipped
No L's, I win by landslides and forfeits (okay)
Got the "California Love" like 'Pac
Malik on a track?  I can't be stopped
I was once told by a wise MC
Think before you spit on the M-I-C
Reppin N-Y-C, 'til I D-I-E
You can't S-double-E-E-E M-C
Gettin "Spellbound" like K-Solo
'Bout to go loco, from breakin backs like bolo
I know you say he got the ill flow-doe
As I +Jam+ with my +Jimmy+ like the Wolves in Minne-soto
Lookin good in the photo but, make this clear
When I spit, throw your hands in the air and

[Chorus]

[C-Rayz Walz]
Uh, I write lines hype like fight time - KILLIN IT
Plug this beat in your lifeline - FULFILLIN IT
Stain your brain with the flame - SP-SPILLIN KID
Bump this junk in your trunk - 4-WHEELIN IT
Rock like stones and bricks and pebbles
Hot like chrome that split the devil
Chase the base, fix the levels
Case the place, vick your bezels
Free incoming - like NexTel
I see men dumbin but, sex sells
Life is ill and triflin still, I fight for meals
In this lifetime, rhyme for real
Signed and sealed, time to peel
Yo son I shined BEFORE I signed the deal
Make this clear I'ma take this year
Don't just stand there, throw your hands in the air and

[Chorus]

[C-Rayz Walz]
You wanna see daddy be a clown when he come around
Be a clown now - BOW BLAOW blaow blaow..
You wanna see daddy be a clown when he come around
Be a clown now - BOW BLAOW blaow blaow..
