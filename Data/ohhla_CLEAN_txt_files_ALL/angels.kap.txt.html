[Madd Kapp]
In the background's the future, angels singing
Heaven on Earth, no matter what evil is bringing
It's temporary, Jesus walks with all souls
Alive and well, even though he died befo'
We all sin but as long as we believe we straight
God's justice will strike on through the hell's gate
With the faith of a billion souls wide awake
For all to see, especially the heads of state
It is written, it comes like a thief in the night
In the, blink of an eye with a hole in the sky
Life as we know it is simply bye-bye
There's, nowhere to run from this so why try?
The Lord's comin to get all of the rest of his kingdom and
extend his hands and welcome us to freedom
He died for our sins and Madd Kapp believes him
This is my testamonial, my Lord is Jesus, sing on

And all the angels say {*7X*}

You ever hit rock bottom and had nowhere to turn?
Have you ever had cashflow problems and got burned?
Did you pray for these things to vanish and blamed God?
It's a test, to see if your faith will thrive on
All the monetary things in life just don't matter
if you can't share the wealth when your family's scattered
All your friends sell dope and pimp out hoes
Then you wanna be accepted so you follow that road
I done been there befo', sometimes I still go
It's the faith that matters, your soul can still go
to the heavens up above if you still believe
And let him know you still try and don't live to deceive
Be a thug for humanity and help your brother
Count your blessings, go home and hug your mother
Tell her you love her, tell her everything's okay
Forget the past, cause you be gone on any day, sing on

And all the angels say {*7X*}

La lahh...
{*Madd Kapp sings along with choir*}
Yeah, ha ha, yeah!
And all the angels say, heh, and all the angels say
And all the angels say, and all the angels say, heh, yeah
And all the angels say, heh, yeah
And all the angels say... WOO~!</pre>
