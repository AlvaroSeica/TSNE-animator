[MJG]
The hammer hit the table leaving me with 7 years 
My history was shit so I could'nt shed a tear 
My future was a wall, surrounded by a cage 
Them laws got me locked down damn at an early age 
The only thing I got is a lust for the streets, the shit I gotta learn 
And the shit I gotta teach 
I'm living for the minute, muthafuck a whole hour 
And I aint pickin shit up when It falls in the shower 
My lady sends me pictures with her pussy in the air, 
but she aint really there 
So I don't really care 
The only thing I got is a muthafuckin dinner 
So fuck what I had, cuz where I'm at I'm a beginner 
I gots to be a winner in this muthafuckin mix up 
Get my shit together, scope it out and try to fix up 
Some confidence to keep a real nigga going strong, 
the system is my house, the system is my home, 
the system was designed to keep a brotha on his back 
The system crackers caught me that's exactly where I'm at 
My lawyer was a snitch, got me framed started buggin 
My muthafuckin phone and the judge was his cousin 
It's hard thinkin positive with negative around me 
So I had to relate to the grounds that surrounded thee 
House and The Mound where I chill 
with the niggaz who respected a real nigga 
Cuz MJG respect them too 
So I had to survive living my life with the street rule "stay cool" 
Disregard school and make my money fool, check it 
It's hard to understand where I'm comin from if you on the outside talkin shit 
Lookin in, then again if you was on the inside lookin out, 9 times outta 10 
You would probably be my friend 
Nigga how you figure, the system's gonna help ya 
The ghetto's where they put ya, the ghetto's where they kept ya 
See deep down in my heart I had this urge to go astray 
And knock out all my problems in one ordinary day 
The system got me thinkin cuz I'm locked down in a tank 
They saw a brotha strokin, so they had to make his ship sank 
So I can't get mixed up with them devils or no other 
With Ani.....mosity I hate when It's a brother, none other 
Than a buck, duck, hoodle up, shootin up thangs in the wind 
I'm in the Pen, you outside lookin in </pre>
