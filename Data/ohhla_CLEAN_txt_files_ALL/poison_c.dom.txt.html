(Saw II sample)
For years you have burned those around you with your lies, cons, and deceits.
For the games you've played with others.
Once you're in Hell, only the devil can help you out.

(Intro)
The truth (The truth)
About the poison
Snake niggas
Poison
About the poison
Fucking savages

[Dom Pachino]
It was the poison craft the wine that I drunk
That had my face numb
It had a taste of venom that slithered right off the snakes' tongue
Others had a sip before and got brainwashed
For a decade and full weeks and walk in streets like mummies
In a flick from Rob Zombie
The Living Dead like George Romero
He befriended Tarantino, the self-proclaimed Hip-Hop Shapiro
Capitalized off many men's talents and gave 'em zero
Matter fact gave 'em trickery
Others became immune to the poison and that was me
Separate thyself from the wicked
So suddenly snap out the spell
So beautiful from the outside but what lies inside the shell
It ain't hard to tell
Where the evil men dwell, locked for eternity
In a six-by-six cell
Your hair burning screams
Nightmares, I'm not concerned with dreams
He crushed 'em and smoked 'em like his favorite dust blunt
What happened to 'In Allah We Trust'? Now we trust none
It's still justice for all, its just ain't my call
I was once a loyal soldier but I didn't fall
I pulled the John Rambo; one man versus them all
One man versus them all; Terrorist versus them fucking all

(Sample)
I want to control my own destiny</pre>
