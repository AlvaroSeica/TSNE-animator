[Chorus: Ras Attitude]
Fyah, fyah, dem can't touch di fyah
Fyah, fyah, internal fyah
Fyah, fyah, dem can't touch di fyah
Cause a red hot fyah fi gon burn bagga wire
Fyah, fyah, dem can't touch di fyah
Fyah, fyah, internal fyah
Fyah, fyah, dem can't touch di fyah
Cause a red hot fyah fi gon burn bagga wire

[No Malice]
The price of hell has its benefits
..I pray you not be ignorant
...Clearly I am seeing with
..My all-seeing eye, no pyramid
I, too, was a derelict
The truth raised me from the dead when I became aware of it
..Ridin Tony's coattails
Now Tony in a cold cell
Wife home, miss him a lot
She might wait, she might not
Lookin at a whole family torn apart
Man, this game colder than a whore's heart
..And we don't cop pleas
Never mind snitchin, he better not sneeze
Did I scale them keys? You be the judge
Every good boy deserves fudge

[Chorus]

[No Malice]
Led to the slaughter, precious is the blood
That stained the cross, there's no greater love
Like the days of Noah, no greater flood
Than when them birds got shipped, no turtle doves
..Maybe a few chickens
That I saved, for the drought, when it was slim pickings
Then with one touch my soul became quickened
When I revisit my past my soul becomes sickened!
Clock's tickin, go check your Audemar
The bezel on that Chopard will only get you so far
Mozart never tickled this many keys
And your favorite emcees ain't who they claim to be
The cat's out the bag, WHOOPS! Shame on me
I don't fear death, they tell me it come in threes
Be ye not deceived, we reap as we sow
Life, too, comes in threes: Father, Son, Holy Ghost

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
Hell or high water, we gon' keep rollin
Lookin in my watch it's like hell freezed over
Hell, money couldn't hold my composure
Bull in a china shop, that's how I'm bulldozin
Gene found God, they thinkin we at odds
Must ain't know my father, he ain't never spared a rod
EGHCK~! It's two sides to a card
Just opposite ends of two peas in a pod

[No Malice]
And I owe it to my Granny who instilled the fear of God
In the heavens lookin at me, receivin this Grammy nod
The game camouflage like S.W.A.T. Team riot gear
Dudes is facades in this lane we pioneered
Now they can't wait 'til we drop, that's diarrhea
I found God, the rest found +Jail+ like Madea
That's what you get when you pumpin that Britney Spears
Now how you gon' act at the truth that's in your ear?
