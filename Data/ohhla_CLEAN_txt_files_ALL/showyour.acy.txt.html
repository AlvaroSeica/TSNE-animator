Typed by: multsanta@sprynet.com

aww... show your right
to all of my brothers
show your right
to all of my sisters
show your right
to my mothers and my fathers
show your right, you know you're right
show your right

yeah, what up people livin' in this world
who know that the time is now
peace to the sun child, Gods and earths alike
truly we got that know-how, we got that know-how
that what, where, why and when
oh, wow, is that fool at it again?
oh yes, we goin' to the promised land, jack
where you won't get spooked by a casper
last of the second half who spoke and spat it
kick the science and then math to add it
life is a habit
don't combat it, dog
I gots to breathe and smoke before I breathe in smog
I step outside and I hug the street
I spit life through the mic, flow and love the beats
so let me count the ways while I count my scars
I count for paydays but I still count stars
can't count counterclockwise
I gotta count yards
so don't count me out on account I ain't actin' hard
so don't tell me how it could be
'cause positivity has been good to me
and negativity is no good to me
it's not good for me
it's understood to me

show your right
to all of my homies
show your right
to my fair weather friends
show your right
to all the people that love me
show your right
and all the people that hate me
show your right
all the people in shackles
show your right
and for the people that passed
show your right
back to the essence
show your right, you know you're right
show your right

now what if i told you you never gonna win
too high to get over to low to get under
you stuck in the middle and you never gettin' in
universal soldier smokes too much doja
can't stay sober to hold your game
when you're all numbed up like novocaine
well just wash my brain, I can't complain
about a thang
I'm walkin' outside in the rain
yes, I'm walkin' outside in the rain
I ain't scared of the rain
or the sleet or the snow or the pain
or the pleasure or the loss or the gain
sorry that I didn't get to read your mind
instead I read in between the lines
gotta break ground when I break down
don't make a sound
the snakes are all around, intend to take you down
but I can see their intent
even though I look through the eyes of a squint
and I get bent
hmm they constantly askin' why
havin' the audacity to question my capacity
but I won't be pacified or classified
shit, I'll be the last to die

show your right
to all the free thinkers
show your right
to the worldwide scams(?)
show your right
to the old and the wise
show your right
to the young and the curious
show your right
I got my ears on the ??
show your right
I got my eyes on the future
show your right
I got my physical finesse
show your right
you know you're, show your right

oh yes, put your bid in
get in where you fit in
sittin' on these righteous flows
head shoulders knees and toes
move that body across the floor
head shoulders knees and toes
move that body across the floor
uh, yeah</pre>
