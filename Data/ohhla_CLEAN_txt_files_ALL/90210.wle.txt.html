[Chorus]
And she throws up, whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nose bleed
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)
She live her whole life like T.V.
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)

[Verse One]
Ms. Rodeo, tell me where your day go
Part-time waitress she really wanna make it
In the "City of Lights", it's hard to see clear
She don't really care about anyone advice
And nothin' here's real, and everyone's alike
Cause everyone dreams of the millionaire's life
She barely eats at all, if she do she eats light
Indulging a meal when a toilets in sight
Expose those fries, can't hold those down
To reap those seven pounds, must release several pounds
This is Heaven on Hell
This is how she wanna live
She ain't really trippin', she's on Beverly Hills

[Chorus]
And she throws up, whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nose bleed
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)
She live her whole life like T.V.
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)

[Verse Two]
Just another day out in Beverly Hills
She sing, model, and dance, but can't sit still
Believing the screens or anything there
But reality shows ain't real
So pretentious with no potential
She goes to catch up, although her rents up
In her defense
She part of the crowd
She gonna borrow some money
So she can party at Chows
It's apart of her goal
It's all she knows
Graduated from Roseau, addicted to blow
Addicted to stardom, a wish to blow
So she kisses the stars
And gives them a blow
After every show, a dream she hold
Inhibition is gone, she just wanna be known
She wanna be know, she just wanna be known
Pulling down her skirt
"I never done this before"
Nah

[Chorus]
And she throws up, whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nose bleed
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)
She live her whole life like T.V.
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)

[Verse Three]
You know big-breast girls, never ever pay rent
They meet them Rich Boys, +Throw D's+ on that bitch
Lease on the whip
Beach on the weekend
Hotel suite, room keys is your gift
Dream of the fame or a ring on her finger
Now you just a whore to the male entertainers
Word spreads fast that your knees spread quick
The sun's always out
But it's clouds over here
Look, cocaine addiction, apartment eviction
To add to the list of Beverly Hills victims
Hopin' you can see my vision
Next time you look down on a nigga

[Chorus]
And she throws up, whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nose bleed
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)
She live her whole life like T.V.
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, Celebrity dreams
She is...(90210)</pre>
