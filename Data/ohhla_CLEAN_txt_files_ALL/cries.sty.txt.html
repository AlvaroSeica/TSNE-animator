(Chorus)

(Taylor Swift):

A young mother cries
a young father cries
they'll never hear their baby cry
a part of both of them has died
cry, cry, cry

(Verse 1)

(Chris Styles):

She hit me with the news 'round 2 in the mornin'
she called me saying "please come over it's important"
on my way to her house I'm thinking "what is this about?"
didn't expect these to be the words that came out her mouth
"I'm pregnant for the first time in my sex life"
I said "you sure?" when she said "yes, I took the test twice"
I'm thinking "what now?", this is big news
when she looked me in the eyes "do you want to keep it too?"
I said "it's a big commitment but I'm ready"
she kissed me then I took a knee and I kissed her belly
this is my son or daughter, I'ma be a father
am I starting a family? How the fuck will I support it?

(Chorus)

(Taylor Swift):

A young mother cries
a young father cries
they'll never hear their baby cry
a part of both of them has died
cry, cry, cry

(Verse 2)

(Chris Styles):

Months pass by, we still haven't told anyone
I'm thinking 'bout marrying this girl, nah maybe not
I'm just confused, can you blame me? I'm a young man
I got to consider my options and stick to one plan
we both still live at home with our families
all she keeps saying is "my daddy's 'gon be mad at me"
I told her "don't worry", she said "how could I not?"
"He's gonna kick me out" I said "fine, we'll get our own spot"
"I'll get a job, it'll just be us"
in the back of my head I know minimum wage won't be enough
she told me "rapping won't cut it"
the thing I regret about it is
I snapped and I told her "bitch leave my music out of this"

(Chorus)

(Taylor Swift):

A young mother cries
a young father cries
they'll never hear their baby cry
a part of both of them has died
cry, cry, cry

(Verse 3)

(Chris Styles):

We started fighting a lot, both stressed out our minds
she had to drop out of school and run away from home to hide it
she was staying at her friend's house, ignoring my calls
little sister asking me why I'm punching holes in the walls
I never answer, I'm feeling irresponsible
I know she's 7 months in and still ain't been to the hospital
to see if it's healthy, a boy or a girl
meanwhile I'm working two jobs, it's destroying my world
I get a letter in the mail titled "don't write back"
saying she love me and she want me to have my life back
she understand if I don't want to see her again
she commited suicide that night, damn

(Chorus)

(Taylor Swift):

A young mother cries
a young father cries
they'll never hear their baby cry
a part of both of them has died
cry, cry, cry

cry
cry, cry ,cry
