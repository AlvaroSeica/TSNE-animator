[Intro: Bounty Killer (Raekwon)]
Well ain't I a risin' star, lord have mercy
(Yo let me get that Dutch master)
Wit Bounty Killer and Raekwon
(This goes for the Jamaican niggas)
Lord have mercy, violent, violent, violent
(New York to Jamaica yo)
Never stop until I sing, me sing, me sing, huh

[Chorus: Bounty Killer]
War! and no type of thing is sky pagin', rappers are preachin'
And them girl know, there is nobody in this world, til I step it
Raekwon, done skill 'em, and then serve on
Gun shot at my car, and he boy, scared, well

[Bounty Killer]
New York, say I, wonder if one day that
So many of them say that, they want war
Me offer five to five skills, and then I submit
So penalty now, give in, they want the lucky charms
Gun shotter, park on them, me, boy
Scared, jungle this, them haunts the war, but not them get this
Then they wonder why, so them count the penny
Party by must skill and pop all the Henny
War you can't storm me like him Louis bent it
Gun shotter drop the nine hard, and he hold it
Lick off the pants fall down, we need wallets
There's only one, rapper behind a nine, watch it
War, them can't hold the Wu-Tang, we dones ratchet
Watch it, hey me gun gon' lock like the rocket
Be fly, up in me, gun spark, like the market
You tuba in your boat, and then you like to hold it

[Chorus]

[Raekwon]
Relax your soul like Clarks from England
These terrorists is back, gun cocked, wit their jury swingin'
Collabo on, we get laced in the Avalon
Runnin' the Dutch, my marathon, done carried on
These scandalous brothers, we trample this
They can get lamped wit this, Bounty and Chef, don't even sample this
A loner, a shark tie your brother up on a
Pass the Corona, what's the science Bounty?
All they knew, he was wit Shaolin now
Police be wildin', you know, so we was splurgin' it, Virgin Islands
It's Mediterrean, lady try to play me in
Came wit a man, he had a ruger, he's Arabian
He had an accent, plus his back was bent
I'm on the corner as he pressured up wit black tints

[Chorus]

[Bounty Killer]
I, wonder if one day that
So many of them say that, they want war
Me offer five to five skills, and then I submit
So penalty now, give in, they want the lucky charms
Gun shotter, park on them, me, boy
Scared, welcome

[Raekwon]
Diamonds, come and walk wit me, gun point emotionally
Playin' me close like he suppose to be
He looked at 18, word to my son
He was a paid fiend, gettin' money in Jamaica, Queens
Lex' keys fell out my pocket, yo, dun, he cocked it
Ready to blaze me like a sky rocket
Suddenly stunned, dunn dropped the gun
So now it's over, now I'm slidin' in a Rover wit one
We stay trifler, rude boys buildin' in the ghetto cypher
A year from now I buy my bitch a tiger

[Outro: Raekwon (Bounty Killer)]
Word up, no infeltrators, only Wally gators
Gun shotter, park on them, me, boy...</pre>
