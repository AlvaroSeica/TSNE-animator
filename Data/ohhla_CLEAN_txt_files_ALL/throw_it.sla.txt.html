[Intro: Swizz Beatz]

{"Mr. Porter"}
We about to set it off right nowwwww!

[Chorus One: Swizz Beatz]
You know I ain't Bill Gates honey
But I'ma act like I ain't never had money
And throw it away, and throw it away
And throw it away, and throw it away
You see me throw it away, and throw it away
I like to throw it away, let's throw it away
You know I ain't Jay-Z honey
But I'ma act like I ain't never had money and

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Live from the area, area, wasted
Try us we'll bury ya, bury ya, wasted
Standin on couches, everybody know me
Rock star, only thing that's left to do is O.D.
Realest nigga out here, out here
In the club doin what got my name out here, out here
You can call it tippin, you can call it trickin
You can call it dissin, that is if you wanna
We stuck the rounds up and go ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Throw them bitches on cue like ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Throw 'em in the sky when you hear us go ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Uhh, let it fly, go ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Uhh, you only live one time, one time
Your favorite rapper up in here with one-time, one-time
You know what?

[Chorus Two: Swizz Beatz]
You know I ain't Jay-Z honey
But I'ma act like I ain't never had money
And throw it away, and throw it away
And throw it away, I like to throw it away
And throw it away, you see me throw it away
Pull a stack out, get it up and throw it away
You know I ain't Bill Gates honey
But I'ma act like I ain't never had money and

[Joell Ortiz]
All my money got wings on it
Fact, booties got my ding-a-ling on it
Clap, clap, clap, make that butt applaud
You got all that back, what you frontin for?
Bitches bitches, this is y'all song
I got riches, itchin to sit in y'all thong
We the business, this is Slaughterhouse baby~!
This is what it's all about, crazy
Money, blowin in the breeze like ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Like a picture pose I got cheese like ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Come, come, get this money from me ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
I don't want it honey
I don't make it rain, I make it snow bunny ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Climb the pole to the top of that bitch
I ain't got it like that but I got it like, this

[Chorus One]

[Crooked I]
Yeah bitch damn right
I'm pipin a lesbian stripper in a Dodge Sprinter, Dick Van Dyke
Whores gon' love it when I go Warren Buffett
throwin euros on the floor ballin on a foreign budget
Slaughter's in the House, look at that clique, that clique
Deeper than the breaths of a fat chick, fat chick
Party in V.I.P. with the Earth's realest
on blue poison shrooms, now the club is Smurf village
Throw the money in the air like ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
I'm yellin out falsetto like ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
I know you killers hold the metal tight ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Who give a fuck, we all ghetto right? ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Uhh, I had a lapdance, moment of clarity
This a tax write-off, this my favorite charity; uhh

[Chorus One]

[Joe Budden]
Tell her she can crash here, hit and run, hit and run
Hop off that pole, get on a different one, different one
I told her do that thing I like and she ain't do it
That was my bad thinkin that she ain't stupid!
Cute face with a pretty butt, pretty butt
Shake got a nigga sayin giddy-up, giddy-up
Throwin Diddy bucks, put it down as a pick-me-up
Money too long for me to go try and titty fuck
Call murder like ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Even got the valet workers like ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
You scratch that and it's one thing ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Cause I'll fuck around and you gon' hear the gun sing ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na")
Uh, Red Bottoms hoppin out the coupe
We got it tied up, even when we outta the loop
I tell her

[Chorus Three: Swizz Beatz]
You know I ain't Bill Gates honey
But I'ma act like I ain't never had money
And throw it away, and throw it away
And throw it away, I like to throw it away
And throw it away, you see me throw it away
Pull a stack out, get it up and throw it away

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
We about to set it off right now
Hands in the air!
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</pre>
