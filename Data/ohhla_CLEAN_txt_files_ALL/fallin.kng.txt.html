Song:   Fallin In Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You know I like everything about you
I don't really care if you have a boyfriend
Those things never really matter to me
I'ma make you fall in love with a gangsta
Cause I know you ain't never met nobody like me
I know your friends tell you
Not to fuck with g's
But check it out..

[Chorus]
Boy I know you want it fast
But we could take it slow
You got me thinkin' bout you day &amp; night
Like 24
You got me hoping
I would be with you
(be with you)
You make me feel like
Nobody else ever come
(ever come)
You got me so in love
I think I'm fallin' for a thug
Oh boy

I know you wonder
If I'm gonna treat you right
If you wrong, if you right
Would we fuss? will we fight?
I know you hate the drama
Trust me I hate it too
And I been heart broken
Don't believe in dÃ©jÃ  vu
If you wanna think about it
Go ahead there is no reason for
I could make you feel
Like no other man has done before
Like a kid - like a wife
Like a first time on a bike
Yes you might get hurt
But soon enough you will heal
Then you back up on the wheel
So shorty what's the deal?
Damn you hella fine
Got looks that will kill
You beautiful &amp; crazy
A lady from the hood
A perfect little mama
Hey baby what's good?

[Chorus]

Lil g professional
Make you feel like a queen from head to toe
She's beautiful &amp; edible
I'll do whatever
You need to let me know
Tongue kissing
Make a list of what you wishin'
I will do it for you
All over your body
Please don't tell nobody
Meet me at the hotel lobby
I'm with my homeboy beto
Bring a friend
Let's start a party
Grey goose &amp; let me choose
Let me get some of that blue dream
I wanna know what it is
That you think
We can try some new things
You bring
A passionate essence into this room
She's falling for a gangsta
She loves that I'm tattoo'd
Baby don't be scared to love me
You won't regret it trust me
You got my blood rushing
Sexual seduction

[Chorus]

So what's it gonna take?
I know you also feeling me
I smoke a blunt
As I write this little symphony
I grab a 40
And I'm proud to share it with ya
The woman of my dreams
You will paint a perfect picture
Swear to god I never felt
The connection that we have
You're something so amazing
You could even make me laugh
I'm fallin' for a thuggish chick
She keeps it so hood
She might not look or dress
But shorty will impress
She got that good-good
Never nothing less
A hot mess
Got me fiendin' for it all
It ended with the rain
It started with a call
Love at first sight
Believe what you saw

[Chorus]

I gotta be with you
Yeah yeah</pre>
