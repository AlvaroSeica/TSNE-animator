[Verse 1: Young Noble]
When I die don't say nothin'
Cause yall ain't neva loved me
If you say you did ?? you frontin'
Heard you wanted to slug me
God hate ugly
But only God can judge me
Trust me ?? all that fake thug love shit disgust me
Sometimes I wish these muthafuckas hurry up and bust me
Sippin' mad Henny
Rollin' my ashes in a dutchy
The world sayin'fuckin me
Well fuck you too
If it ain't no love for me
Ain't no love for you
Mama always told me
These muthafuckas ain't shit
They gone when you broke
But they there when you rich
The fact is this
You need to handle ya own business
Stop ridin' all on my dick
Nowadays, ya family be the worst fuckin' ones
It seem like to them money thicker then blood
Show me some love
A young thug need some too
Wonda' why my young souljahs walkin' around all evil
Cause nobody give a fuck if we die tonight
So when we die don't cry aiight (aiiight)
Cause nobody give a fuck if we die tonight
So when we die don't cry aiight (aiiight)
Yo....

[Chorus: Young Noble]
So if we die do the same for us
Shed no tears
Been Outlaw, thug livin' in this game for years
None of yall care if we was to die tonight
So when we die don't cry aiight (aiiight)

So if we die do the same for us
Shed no tears
Been Outlaw, thug livin' in this game for years
None of yall care if we was to die tonight
So when we die don't cry aiight (aiiight)

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
Yo...
I live my life righteously
According to the thug laws
A young souljah
Young Noble Outlaw
Is my niggaz down to die for me
(Yayy Yayyyie)
God niggaz showin' love from dirty Jerz til the Bay
But got muthafuckaz hatin' from New York to L.A
But it all come with the came you choose to play
Playin' tapes out the blockbuster
Or gettin' chases by the cops cause you a block hustla
Ride or Die
I got my eyes on the big picture
If we on the same page
Nigga I'll stick wit cha
But if we ain't
You on some bullshit
I'll get wit cha
I owe you somethin'
How you figure
I'm a made nigga
Get the finger
So respect this if you don't respect yaself
Cause I'm a souljah
Everyday I test myself
You gotta give it if you want it (huh)
And my mistake is the respect and you want it (huh)
You gotta take it
When I die muthafucka
Don't shed na'l tear
If you ain't show me na'l bit of love when I was here
I swear ?? that's why we have gangs and brotha's
They'll rather see us die
Then tell us they love us
Fuck'em!

[Chorus: Young Noble]

[Verse 3: EDI]
No time for waitin'
Times are wastin'
The clock ticks quicker nigga
Go on and get it nigga
Strapped ?? but these words'll start
My deadly mission depart
From baby kitchen
While she in' -- I'm already gone
I ain't bullshittin'
Me and my niggaz gotta reach the top
Go head and complain  cause the game don't stop
And the world keeps spinning
And everybody in it
Keeps spinning with it
Wishing for seven digits
You plan to pay heaven a visit
But right there
That's a contradiction
Cause if you see them gates you ain't visiting, uhh
You there to stay
No time to tell ya baby girl to wipe those tears away, tears away
Here today and gone tomarrow
They mourn yo ass in sorrow
Yo legacy'll follow
Ya peoples is left hallow
Yeah I know
That's how the game go
Fa sho'

[Verse 4: Napoleon]
I woke up in the morning ta' death
Hallow from right to my left
Confusion since
When I go just lay my Tek on my chest
And stress ain't shit
In a ordinary day for my clique
And twisted love with the wrong
So  Fuck'yall and yall relationship
This my life and I'm livin' it
From the fake friends and bitches
From the fake smiles and kisses
This real love and it's business shit
Do you dig this and my problem
Never see you cause you see thru
I'm absolute ?? 100 percent -- thugged out with a ridahs permit
To the overdose , I'm doing it
On my mama I ain't knew this
And true this
Got caught up doin' the wrong things, so truest
Put ya money where ya heart is
Damn you ain't got no money or no heart
So of course you shut down from the start
Why the  you smile in my face
When I'm in pain why you cry
You scream Mu nigga I feel you
But no that's a lie
So don't cry nigga
And don't cry nigga
Ride on muthafucka
Outlaw!

[Chorus: Young Noble] x4</pre>
