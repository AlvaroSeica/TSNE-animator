(Verse 1)
I got my pick-up truck, and I got my gun
And I got a taste for whiskey and pills
I know I'm kinda fucked, cuz I'm my fathers son
And I got a hole in my heart I can't fill
Turn of the parking lights, down by the Rivers Inn
This is my darkest night girl, You're swimming in my head

(Chorus)
It happens all the time, I blow it everytime
People change with time, call me anytime girl
I miss you oh so often, and what's been said is done
This is my only option, girl I'll be anyone for you
Anyone

(Verse 2)
Out on the interstate, play my radio
And I confess to all my sins
Been driving sever hours, still got three to go
It always ends where it begins
You've got your broken wings, I've got my soul upon
girl all these fucked up things, that keep us apart

(Chorus)
It happens all the time, I blow it everytime
People change with time, call me anytime girl
I miss you oh so often, and what's been said is done
It's my only option, I'll kill anyone for you

Anyone, anywhere, anytime for you
Anyone, anywhere, anytime for you
Anyone, anywhere, anytime for you</pre>
