[Intro]
Aww man~! Aww, aww, aww man damn!
Young Veggies, The Super 3, Tyler the Creator

[Casey Veggies]
Ride-ride-ridin 'round town, same old seven steelo
Nigga couldn't change, you could blame it on my ego
Young'n started grindin, man I did it on the d-low
Came back shinin with that 4th quarter free throw
Game time nigga even if get the rebound
Hoes tryin to figure where I be now
But that love shit, is somethin I don't see now
Lost still profound, and every day it go down
My niggaz got a name now, these other niggaz lame now
So I do my thang just to bring them haters pain now
Nigga, Matt Martians told the boy to write a verse
Came in killin ain't even need to rehearse
Swear I take it down and I make that girl disperse
And I ain't just kill it man, I put it in a hearse
I'm back home like

[Tyler, the Creator]
Suck it up, cock it up, time is when the clock is up
Cause you don't have to talk for us to chop it up (chop it up?)
Freezer burn, erection when I see you squirm
for me not to get inside your face, I'm the newest dermatologist
Blood on my shirt no one acknowledged it
From teenage babes leaving dates I got to followin
Swallow it, clean it off, polish it
Axe you up in the back of my shack - fuck some hollow tips
Throw you in my deep creek of self-esteem on some shallow shit
The kids used to tease, now I'm hiding in the leaves
of the trees near the school where their teen daughter at-teend
I, grab them by the pale throat, throw them in the passenger
to balance up the color of my van it matches egg yolk
My only fucking way to calm down, the view of dead folk
"This movie fuckin sucks," because the pay per view is dead hoe
Now shut the fuck up and work magic with eso-pha-ghost</pre>
