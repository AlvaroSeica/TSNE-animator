Okay

You can blame it all on me tonight
Dont wanna walk away 
Tonight i'll be the bigger man
You just keep on trying 
To push me away
But im not leaving 
We got so far to go
(I wanna know) 
You'll believe and me and keep away your pride
(I wanna know)
Cause I cant imagine you not by my side 
(I wanna know)
That you'll share with me your hopes and all your dreams
Cause baby I love you for loving me

So glad I found you babe
So thankful for your ways
Its such a blessing 
To love and be loved in return
I tried to keep myself from you
But now I finally see the truth 
Can't nobody love me like you do

Everytime that i think about
Our love and everything we shared
I'll never leave never let you down
Cause I know that youll always be there 

Everybody's talking
About us and what they saying
They don't believe that we're gonna make it
But I still believe in you

You'll believe and me and keep away your pride
(I wanna know)
Cause I cant imagine you not by my side 
(I wanna know)
That you'll share with me your hopes and all your dreams
(I wanna know)
Cause baby I love you for loving me

-Break-

Wanna thank you babe
For always loving me
Loving me
Said thank you babe
Always loving me 
Don't know what i'd do

(I wanna know)
You'll believe and me and keep away your pride
(I wanna know)
Cause I can't imagine you not by my side 
(I wanna know)
That you'll share with me your hopes and all your dreams
Cause baby I love you for loving me

Okay

You can blame it all on me tonight</pre>
