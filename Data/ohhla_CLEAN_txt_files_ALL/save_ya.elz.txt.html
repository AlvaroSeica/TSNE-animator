[Verse 1 - Elzhi]
Picture me goin out, I know what a ho about
Tryin to glow off the next man's dough account
But I've, been swift on the toes 
Since an infant, why should I treat you different with a gift and a rose?
That's the way I could please ya, but you a hood skeezer
I should squeeze ya, for smokin up my good reefer
You see me hopin out of limousines
So you begin to scheme on my winnin team, but in your dreams
You got them niggaz actin strange goin crazy
Cause you got a figure that could change 'no' to 'maybe'
Infatuated with material things
You only see your feet in them shoes, your ears in those rings
But ah, you could come around on your best behavior
But sorry love I can't save ya

And I know every nigga on the block gon' praise ya
I'm international, I can't save ya

[Break 1]
And there's only one thing I know
You really got to go for sure, hey yo (yo, yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 2 - Elzhi]
Yeah, yeah
So baby girl on no grounds, will we marry, slow down
So just hold your horses like a merry go round, round
You fantasizing about shopping sprees
Cause you seen me droppin G's, like I'm choppin kis
Callin your best friend and tell her that I'm ballin
And how you go and have me all in love fallin
Fed you a meal, now you head over heels
Dead it and chill, you would have got in bed for a bill
But still, you can't explain why you feelin me this past year
Which one will it be you liability or asset?
Let me take a guess, you would show your naked flesh
And shake your breast at any man that would make success
But don't come around me for a favor
Sorry sweetheart I can't save ya

And we can roll out, roll up, smoke herb of different flavors
I can get ya high but can't save ya

[Break 2]
Primetiming's in her mind
But she said me for this time

[Break 1]

[Verse 3 - Elzhi]
So now, me and you we could never be an item
You goin nowhere, look how far I've come
I got my own shit, but you don't own shit
You bone for a Sprint phone and your home rent
You might have played other niggaz but they not me
They see with two eyes, you know I got three

[Verse 4 - T3]
You can't play me, no not three
Uh uh, I'm not the one, that's why I got free (free)
You can't save the unsaveable
Ms. Unsatiable, you comin at me like a Flavor Roast
You want it your way or the highway
You raise your voice, but settle down this where I stay
You never cease to surprise me
So I had to go like a worker on a Friday
You know what you did, don't try to like me sideways
A little thing called trust
Blowin my phone up, all in my contacts callin peeps up
So time's up, I done been through enough
The road too rocky for me to roll so I bust up
Bust up, bust up (yeah)

[Break 2]

[Break 1]

[Break 3]
I could send you my French ride
Was it to have a good time?
