[Luni Coleone]
Now come on everybody lets get fucked up
Coleone in the party straight actin a nut
I hit prospect roads and my homeboy zoe
Club 69 duce keep drink real cold
Feel me I see Coleone the pimp
Cristal hell naw fuck watchin a bitch
I hit the dance floor bustin like my cousin on wu 
Double teamin come heads trick I'm comin so coo
I need a double shot of hen mixed up with one
And if a bitch wanna drink pass her cris 6-1
Now I'm back on the flow with a cup in my hand
This buzz if foe real thugs 
What it sound like, I'm sayin

[Hook]
Now come on everybody lets get fucked up
The whole room sayin we high as fuck
Ain't nobody on the ball y'all listen to me
Everybody in the party say yeay yeay 

[Luni Coleone]
Its a house party ain't no scrappin and cappin
Strippers in this motherfucker as G's clappin
Got my nigga so high he forgot his name
But he keep a tight grip on his iced out chain
Everybody in this bitch gettin drunk tonight
Two hoes to one man and thats on my life
Eatin pussy ain't cool boy watch yaself
like Martin that's why I squash it with Madsen help
I let a bitch know downtown ain't for me
But I down a 5th of hen get off the hez
Coleone the gangsta wit his cup on full
At the party like yeay yeay ain't no bull

[Hook]

[Luni Coleone]
We gettin fucked up party harty non-stop
Hands raisin the roof nigga fuck the cops
We gonna keep shit crackin til night hit don
And I'm killin this 5th of hen like Jason wins his fawn
I drunk than a motherfucker me and Jay-Live
Ask my curly why I be drunk but live
Drunk drivin, drunk rhymin, drunk fuckin a bitch
Drunk nuttin, drunk cuttin, smashin off on a trick
I pop my colla like killers pop fake ass niggaz
Salt shakin on ya culley like my name ain't venom
Coleone a drunk is a drunk does
Higher than a motherfucker givin it up
