[Tony Touch]
You already know how it's goin down
Right about now we got this new Tash shit
Off of that Control Freek
Aight? The city is OUT y'all~!
And let me tell you some'n
You got that factory system
You got that bootleg-ass shit
Yo man, you might blow somethin
So keep it on the low
We doin this straight for you y'all
Tony Touch, Shade 45, XM 66</pre>
