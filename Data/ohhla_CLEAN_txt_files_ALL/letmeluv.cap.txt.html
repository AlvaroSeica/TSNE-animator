[Mr. Capone-E] Hello?
[Female]       Hey
               I need you, can you please come get me?
[Mr. Capone-E] Yeah, don't even worry about it
               I'll be there

Chorus: Fingazz
I'm the one, you can call, when you need me
You can trust in me, girl, believe me
One call, from the morning to the evenin'
I'll be your man, hold your hand, any season
I can be there for you (For you)
Cherish every little thing about you (Bout you)
All you gotta do is let me
Just let me, just let me
Love you girl

[Mr. Capone-E (Fingazz) {Mr. Capone-E &amp; Fingazz}]
(Verse 1)
I'll be your man, your friend you never had
I'm the type of guy to provide you with a plan
Keep you on the right direction, with this love
When you feelin' insecure
I'll be there with a hug
And every moment that you cry
I share your emotions
I'd protect you with my life
{And my arm stay open}
Walkin' by the ocean as we can a cool breeze
Sunsettin'
You explain, all your needs
And your goals
And desires in this world
I know it's hard, believe it, man, but has it occurred
Preferred (Yeah)
That you need a real man
Not these little boys, still livin' off mom and dad
So I swoop you off your feet
Like a king to a princess
You don't need instrumedley, no need to be stressin' (No)
Confessin' all this love to you
{Let me show what love can do} (Yeah)

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Like I told you, Trix/tricks are for kids
And you're a woman
So listen to the bridge
He buys you tons of roses, but money don't buy love
You waiting up for him
While he's sippin' at the club
Tryin' to buy a lapdance, while you workin' for yours
Tryin' to drop the lame
And change and get yours
Pick up the phone
And call up daddy Capone
I'll be right by your side
When you feel all alone
{Come on now}
Don't let, no one get you down
This song makes you cry
But this song makes you proud
{Holla at your boy}
With this thug-like passion
Raised and representin' the one I love for everlastin'
{True}
But this is just me to you
Never leave you behind, cause real ladies need love, too
And that's a {fact}
I got your back
Just a phone call away, {girl, believe what I say}
I'll be there

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
So let me take you, {where you never went}
And let me save you, and {be your best friend}
Let me hold you, protect your innocence
I be there for you, in
Everytime for presents
{Come on, girl}, time to make that change
No more dead beat lames
No more everlasting pain (No more)
This is the simple
Things we do
From a man to a woman (Yeah)
{Don't trip, I got you}

Repeat Chorus

[Fingazz]
All you gotta do is let me, just let me...
Love you girl...
All you gotta do is let me, just let me...
{*scratching*}
"Fingazz on the track..."
All you gotta do is let me, just let me...
Just let me... {*scratching*}
"Dedicated To The Oldies, Part 2" --&gt; Mr. Capone-E (Love you girl)

Let me show you what love can do
