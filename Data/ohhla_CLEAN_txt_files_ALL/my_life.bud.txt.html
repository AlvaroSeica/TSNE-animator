[Buddha Monk]
Guess who's back at his best, armed for the war
Bring ya best, it's new world order, Buddha Monk
Glock in my hand, locked on every man
The Brooklyn street pharmacist, taking anybody's and I don't give a damn
I sold to ya man, bagged up the dope, then cut 'em by the throat
Then send 'em up the river where Malik got smoked
More blood in the water than a fish in a pond
My bitch bleeding when she getting it on
It's BK, AK-9, semi auto's and grenades
Knives, razors and switch blades
And, fades, dreads and braids
Smoked in the park, in front of the dark, you play
Bullets with no intent, hitting innocent kids
At the stand wit lemonade, Duc-Lo when the World Trade became a fade
Got rid of pounds of hydro and purple haze
Just to get by for the day, man, it's no lie
When I tell you I seen more heads fly
Than Prince's mother screaming when doves cry
People praising King Selassie Ah Judah Allah Buddha
Crosses, hail maries
Candles with seven African powers, witch craft
And all that shit, shit, nigga
My dick in the dirt, I got no time for that shit
Stay guard, move forward, extra clips and no drip
This world is mines, I take what I need
No need for asking, I blaze for what's mines
Keep it real muthafuckas and hold the nine, who want it?

[Chorus 2X: Fat Joe sample]
Y'all wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick never seen a crack house
Wanna war with the Don have your macs out
Bring it on and I'ma show you gangsta</pre>
