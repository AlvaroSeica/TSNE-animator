Yazarah, [Phonte]
My love is gone with Yesterday
[My love is gone with Yesterday]
My love is gone with Yesterday
[My love is gone with Yesterday]

[Yazarah]

We had a love for all seasons
At least its how it used to be
There was no time, space or reason
More special to us than we

My love continue to flourish
As a flower blooms in spring
Then you tried to play love for silly
But the loser is the fool 
Who doesnt play love by the rules

If she breaks your heart
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you
Cause I may not be around
To do the things I used to do
And if you awake to find youre lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way
Cause the love I felt inside 
Has gone away with yesterday

Yazarah, [Phonte]
My love is gone with Yesterday
[My love is gone with Yesterday]
My love is gone with Yesterday
[My love is gone with Yesterday]

[Yazarah]

There was a time when forever
Was common-place for me and you
Laughing, loving, sharing, caring
Seemed to be made just for us two

But I kept on building the dream world
That I thought was you and I
Sorry, I'm sadly mistaken
Cause our castle in the sky
Has turned into a mere goodbye

If she breaks your heart
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you
Cause I may not be around to do the things
I used to do
And if you awake to find you're lost
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way
Cause the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday

Cause the love I felt inside
Has gone away with yesterday

[Phonte]
Love is gone with yesterday x8
