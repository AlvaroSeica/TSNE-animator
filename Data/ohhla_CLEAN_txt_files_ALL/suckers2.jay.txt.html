[ VERSE 1: Kool Rock Jay ]
I'm back once again, so start runnin
Pack your bags and leave cause I'm comin
I'm real like the ( ? )
Don't ask me, ask my DJ why
Slice start the mixin, I start the fixin
Up the traps for killin all saps
Pack up punks, turn around and surrender
The war's over, Jay's the winner
Capture, kill and conquer, my only motive
You can't stop The Rock cause I'm devoted
Friday the 13th and I'm Jason
Fear in your heart, sucker, I'm placin
Follow my path into the dead land
You made the wrong step, you're in quicksand
Stunned you stop, you just can't move
The game's over and you lose

(To the side)  --&gt; Chuck D
Suckers
(To the side)

[ VERSE 2: Kool Rock Jay ]
Adrenaline risin, hearts are pumpin
You're in a daze and you don't know nothin
You wanna bet? You ain't worth a nickel
I hit you hard and fast like ripple
Your mind's sedated, now you're drunk
You can't win, so get on chump
Gangster rules, so pay your dues
Execution terms - you can choose
A lesson to learn every time you try
When eye to eye you make no reply
Behind my back you dis ( ? )
When I came in your face, punk, you're scared
A Nightmare on Jay Street like this
Servin a sucker on a 12-inch disc
Then I wax and polish and I demolish
And when the punks run up, huh, I'll abolish
So many rhymes crammed in a line
Can't comprehend? Then push rewind
You wanna front like you're so live
But I'm back, jack, and all suckers to the side

[ VERSE 3: Kool Rock Jay ]
No white flag, I ain't a pacifist
No peace, cause there's no end to this
You shouldn'ta started what you can't stop
You need insurance, so get a piece of The Rock
Break 'fore you're broke on, rhymes you get choked on
A lightweight punk, so float on
No need for you to keep on tryin
You won't win - and I lyin
Top-paid assassin paid in full
Don't try to get funny cause I got pull
Yo, when I start pullin suckers disappear
Jay's a gangster, let's make that clear
Formin a storm around you and your crew
In the wind, my friend, so smooth you blew
I got a hitlist and it's full of names
I get busy and I don't play games
You'll keep dissin, I'll keep rhymin
Up the charts my records keep climbin
I'm the new one and I just arrived
I don't play, punk, and all suckers to the side

[ VERSE 4: Kool Rock Jay ]
You kept frontin, now you're out of luck
You're stuck in the mustard, so catch up
You're about to dissed on, then get pissed on
Become a fallen star and soon get wished on
A deadly lesson, stop your guessin
Cause you're starin in the barrel of a Smith &amp; Wesson
Take your name, your title, fame and gold
They give you ten years labor with no parole
Cause I'm the hater of fake and sucker sap MC's
With a bass that's kickin like Bruce Lee
And suckers that try to front I'm icin
With a snare that hits you like Tyson
You can't stop this, you better drop this
Boy, you find yourself gettin dissed
Day by day, week by week
Before you leap - you better take a peek
Cause now I can tell, boy, you can't beat me
How I tell? Your voice gettin squeaky
When a beat and scratch is applied
I don't play, it's suckers to the side
Rap's the line to get mine, a true example
And all suckers like a magazine I cancel
I'm the rapper named Kool Rock Jay
Suckers to the side, punk, I don't play
