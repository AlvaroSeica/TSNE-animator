[Stretch]
Huh, blow you out the frame with game
Better learn my name
Check it out, dough expect
The mack Thugadon poet
Snatch it up, profit, drop
Anyone who try to test me
Flex and you better wear a vest G
Ballin' with the Springfield mob
It's crooked where I come from
?? to your dome with the Young Guns
Ruthless, leave you toothless
When I feel like getting wicked
Suckers in the house get evicted
Point blank range you're in danger
Leave you vibrating like a muthafucking pager
Quick for slaying, yeah don't you laying
Getting loot ain't no time for no playing
Sewing up blocks with rocks
Glock kills stop
Dodging for your life, you better clock your watch
When we're rolling up wreck
(don't you know?)
We done took over your block
(and the dough)
And when the Thugadons move with rules
Like a buckwild dog
Play hard to get ?? to the mob
Ruling, taking what's mine
I go for the goal I had enough hard time
Then I pull a ??
Even if a nigga gotta smoke ya
With my dead aim boy I cold choke ya
Fuck you G, it'll be another homicide
What a waste another brother just died

[Hook](repeat 2x)
Blowen em out da frame!

(Rakim sample in blackground)(repeat 2x)
Hit 'em at point blank range
And watch 'em radiate</pre>
