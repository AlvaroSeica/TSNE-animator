[Crypt the Warchild]
Every rhyme I write is 25 to Life
Every rhyme you write don't even deserve a mic
Crossing International borders with a bomb threat
You mothafuckas haven't even left your block yet
You'se a bitch, you'se a ho, heres a prom dress
You wanna try to box with God its no contest
So keep on thinking this shit is sweet
I'm a start a sandstorm and put you under the Middle East
You got it fucked up homie, I've been a beast
Reptilian tongue and my skin is deep
Rumor has it they say I'm thrown off
Until their limbs is everywhere, wigs is blown off

[Jus Allah]
Is that the cast of a deathmask?
Is that water in a red glass?
Why, I'd thought you'd never ask, its as legend has
There's a method to the mad, its direct and fast
Disconnected from the guest its a second-class
I have left a trail of debt, checks in the mail
Heads or tails, death prevails, never fails
I will never get derailed that tip is stale
I will never get to Hell that ship has sailed
I'm refined, mastermind after cash and kind
Hand me gunshot pantomime, axe to grind
Pass into the sublime have a relaxing time
Have a glass of wine, have your last act of kind?

[Planetary]
Everything they say is irrelevant
I'm the element of rap that define pure elegance
Elevate my resident big them up
I'm in the hood rocking JMT shit in the truck
Not I Against I, cause I don't sleep on my stomach
I rock Heavy Metal Kings, and watch the barrel of the gun twitch
You talking dumb shit, hooting and hollering
I lift the cannon and wait for the bazooka to swallow 'em
I'm a do this regardless to them, I'm the original
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel surrounding your pinnacle
Block the perimeter; I hit you with the fade away
Got a bullet with your name on it for a rainy day

[Doap Nixon]
Ok
So many days, so many nights
So much money got fucked up, so many fights
So many niggas got knuckled down for no reason
So many cowards got guns but don't squeeze 'em
YEEEAH!! It's just the way it is
I finally got a whiz that's ready to bless the sun with a hundred kids
So I can fall back, Ralph Lauren straw hat
'Sour Diesel' already showed you I'm all that
I won't stop tryna to ride on you assholes
First week sales donated to Daschel
You think I'm bugging right? C'mon!!
But it's these zeros in my bank account
That got me saying... "Nigga, floss it right"

[Vinnie Paz]
My brain's vast as the sky is
My heart doesn't know what die is
Pyromaniac rap Vinnie starts fires
Only an ignorant thought ignored Osiris
And that's why the enemy lost and caught virus
Brrrrt!! Where I'm from Gods, Earth's, 85ers
Y'all ain't got heat underneath it's all wires
I'm on some champagne shit with bonfires
My whole team animal thug and born liars
You ain't aware of what any the 12 Tribes is
You a devil who tell the enemy where God is

(Outro) Vinnie Paz
And that's how we get down
Yeah! Jedi Mind forever
Jus Allah, Vinnie Paz, Kwestion
Yo Stoupe where you at cuzin?
AOTP - Army of the Pharaoh clique
Doap Nix, whadup cuzo?
King Mag, 7L, Esoteric, Big Mike, Big Red
Sinatra where you at cuzo?
Kamach, Lost Cauze, Celph Titled, Apathy
King Syze, OS, the whole fam
Who really fucking with us out here, man?
This animal rap out here
