Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I ain't in the club, can't afford no bubbly
I ain't got shit, so you don't want to fuck with me
Shit is poppin now, time to lock it down
and see a soldier leave his footprints in yo' stompin grounds

[Diabolic]
Yo...
Birth of dominance, on some divide and conquer shit
Got so bent I split Panagea into 7 continents
Before the tour travels, went to war and stormed castles
Swingin swords in more battles than Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow
Explore Babel's Tower, so now I have the power
Causin scattered showers, rainin fire every half an hour
The seventh sign to y'all Federlines, the best you'll find
I'll stand the test of time and outrun it, so I'm ahead of mine
At times I get to find the Devil's kind and God's likeness
Part righteous hatin makin joints tight as arthritis
Bar fighter, cauterizin eyes with car lighters
And I don't see you nearin me, so lyrically I'm far sighted
Born the dopest, more ferocious than a swarm of locusts
Or some poor and hopeless peasants would see more explosives
Feelin claustrophobic, I exceed your normal dosage
Givin formal notice, 'Bolic never lost his focus

[Chorus]

[Diabolic]
Yo...
I plot to masterlock this pop culture aftershock
Move the +Planet Rock+ and have more props on stage than Carrot Top
No glamour shots on your Magnavox plasma screen
No ads or magazines, just more pull than tractor beams
Smack the battle scene, shattered dreams, took the title
Raided Club Hater with Smooth, and I still pushed the vinyl
I think it's basic Ignoramus, I ain't big and famous
but I can take your greatest masterpiece and fingerpaint it
Drink some tainted liquor, give you my distinctive cadence
then turn the tides, you'll burn alive like +The English Patient+
My thoughts orbit Venus, you'll get torn to pieces
By an aborted fetus, Jesus have reborn a genius
So will I need an orthopedist just to cure diseases
Now all I need is a crowbar to get you off my penis
But I'm broke and my budget couldn't afford some Reese's
That's why respect in this game's payin for my features

[Chorus]

[Diabolic]
Yo...
I swore allegiance to this hip-hop while shadowboxing
And the Big Apple's rotten, so I only have one option
And that's to die sinnin, then take your lives grinnin
Slide in and wring your necks like {?} tribe's winnin
It's nine innings, game over, 'Bolic dominates
Wide awake, violatin while you hibernatin
It's common place for me to shake the Earth's tectonic plates
Open holes in the Empire State and swallow fakes
Annihilate my competition and their top position
Shopliftin a pot to piss in from their mama's kitchen
That's how I'm living, so if and when disaster strikes
My appetite for destruction feeds me in the afterlife
Cause while satellites above my head can +Google Earth+
Somethin tells me what the government can do is worse
That's why I'm doin dirt, makin sure my records spin
I feel it in my flesh and skin, this is where the end begins
