[Intro]
and that's real...
oooh yeeaa yaay yo gotti... pleasure p
let's do it... yeah

[Verse 1]
shawty ride or die here if I'm sober or high
she kno jus wat to do to help a gangsta get by
shawty know I like head... she ain't trippin at all
she go down on a nigga and she a swallow it all
me and her done it all, catch us both at the mall
she can get wat she wanna and it ain't trickin at all
shawty fuck with her nigga her nigga fukk with her bakk
she put her life on the line 'cause she a ride with this sack
wen I went bakk to the hood hustlin movin them birds
she was takin up nursing, studying gettin wats hers
I ain't chase her or sweat her try my best to protect her
wen you fukk with a gangsta baby you bet I'm a bless ya
and that's real

[Chorus]
If you wanna come ride then (let's ride)
If you wanna come smoke then (let's smoke)
If you wanna come drink then (let's drink)
If you wanna come vibe then (let's vibe) come vibe baaaaaaaayyyyy
I been thinkin bout fuckin you
I been thinkin bout kissin you
and touchin and holdin you (that's all I wanna do baby)

[Verse 2]
when we out on the road grinding doin ma shows
she be callin my phone like don't be fuckin them hoes
she at home with my child I be flirtin in the crowd
I need help I can't control myself these hoes be wild
sometimes I think to myself, another nigga in my bed
so I stop thinking all that shit'll fuck yo head.
I take federal chances I work so hard for the bread.
wonder if she a keep it real if I eva go to the fed
she gon write me and visit me like I think that she should
or she gon disrespect me fuck another nigga out the hood
I ain't chase her or sweat her try my best to protect her
I don't kno about love I jus kno jus kno money and pleasure
belive that

[Chorus]
If you wanna come ride then (let's ride)
If you wanna come smoke then (let's smoke)
If you wanna come drink then (let's drink)
If you wanna come vibe then (let's vibe) come vibe baaaaaaaayyyyy
I been thinkin bout fuckin you
I been thinkin bout kissin you
and touchin and holdin you (that's all I wanna do baby)

[spoken: yo gotti]
look here shawty
you know I only know
how to be one way
and that's always real

[Verse 3]
when yo momma was trippin talkin bout kickin you out
you had nowhere to go I let you move in my house
you can jump in my benz, go stunt out on ya friends
I took you all around the world and I a do it again
you respected my grind 'cause you knew I had dat work
and I respected ya mind because you still went to work
see it wasn't bout the money shawty kept it 100
she stayed into it with her family because they knew I was hustlin

[Chorus]
If you wanna come ride then (let's ride)
If you wanna come smoke (let's smoke)
If you wanna come drink (let's drink)
If you wanna come vibe (then let's vibe)
come vibe baaaaaaaayyyyy
I been thinkin bout fuckin you
I been thinkin bout kissin you
and touchin and holdin you (that's all I wanna do baby)
