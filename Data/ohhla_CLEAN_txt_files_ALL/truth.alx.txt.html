[Intro: RZA]
Truth... Cno Evil

[Cno Evil]
Aiyo, the truth is, these kids here, they can't hear, they can't taste
When hip hop is misplaced, the youth hates, abyss fate
I can't bite, my tooth aches, I stay white with no tooth paste
I'm not Jay, I'm not Drake, I stay real, I'm not fake
Hit you with the Elder Scrolls, even though I'm never old
I stay young, high like Skyrim, stay flying
Admiring the ring, them other girls get jealous
Italian soldier like Marcus Claudius Marcellus
That's probably why I can't excel with the media
Cuz my rhymes sound like articles from Wikipedia
And that's the truth, but the truth is, this kid spits
Fire like volcano, stay clean like Drano
Always muy bueno, late nights, Jay Leno
Decisions in my mind that's why I stay judgmental
And that's the truth, that's why you hear it right now (Truth...)
I'm milking the hell out of hip hop til I'm a cash cow, but how?

[Alexander Ebert]
The truth is that I never shook my shadow
Every day it's trying to trick me into doing battle
Calling out 'faker' only get me rattled
Wanna pull me back behind the fence with the cattle
Building your lenses, digging your trenches
Put me on the front line, leave me with a dumb mind
With no defenses, but your defense is
If you can't stand to feel the pain then you are senseless
Since this

[Chorus: Alexander Ebert]
I've grown up some, different kind of fighter
And when the darkness come, let it inside you
Your darkness is shining, my darkness is shining
Have faith in myself, truth

[Alexander Ebert]
I've seen a million numbered doors on the horizon
Now which is the future you chosen before you gone dying
I'll tell you about a secret I've been undermining
Every little lie in this world comes from dividing
Say you're my lover, say you're my homie
Tilt my chin back, slit my throat, take a bath in my blood, get to know me
All out of my secrets, all my enemies are turning into my teachers, because

[Chorus: Alexander Ebert]
Light's blinding, no way dividing
What's yours or mine when everything's shining
Your darkness is shining, my darkness is shining
Have faith in ourselves, truth

[RZA]
Beautiful was the proof in the truth, and it shows in the youth
When they just do what they naturally do, truth is natural
It's actual, and it's factual
Perfection, pragmatic and practical
Unabbreviated, that which has not been deviated
Imperishable and can not be alleviated
It's the language of god, for it's he who created it
And made it, even when a man is cremated
Down to his ashes, his essence remains in the gases
Lies disintegrate as all time passes
Although illusions has been accepted by the masses
And they teach us lies every day in high school classes
Divine and sublime, unaffected by space, motion or time
The truth, the intensive nature of the mind
It's correct, for man has miscalculated
He misrepresented and they misinterpreted
If he feels light in the darkness, regardless
Your pure heart or heartless, it's the truth, it's the proof</pre>
