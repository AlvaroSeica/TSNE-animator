Okay we wrote this for a purpose, to motivate you at the time
With this hypnotizing bassline, please feel free to lose your mind
And get high, get money, get sex, get real, all intertwined
On yeah this is stadium music, fifty thousand at a time

[Chorus]
Let's get right, let's get right, let's get right okay okay {*2X*}
All the girls want HOT-N-FUN, all they lookin for is HOT-N-FUN
All they ask for is HOT-N-FUN, they keep wantin that HOT-N-FUN
Look at you, look at me {*2X*}
HOT-N-FUN... HOT-N-FUN

Let it go

[Pharrell]
Homeboy she's dancin for a reason, not just cause I'm on her hind

She wanna get right, get money, get sex, get real, all intertwined

Everybody's breathin, lovin to love

People don't wanna think no more, they just wanna feel
They wanna let go

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
