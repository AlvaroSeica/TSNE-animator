[Colin Munroe]
Don't pretend, don't pretend
Don't pretend that you will never love again
(Don't pretend that you will never love again)

[Travie McCoy]
Little Miss Teary Eyes, you have no reason to lie to me
and put your coat down, why you waving goodbye to me?
I've been reassessing the situation, sittin silently
And finally realized why you can't look eye to eye with me
And I knew about him the whole time
The hotels, phone calls, psh, the whole nine
But I guess that's what friends are for
And I've come to the conclusion that you're nuttin but a very selfish person
Open up my chest and you'll see
a cold cavity where my heart use to be
Makin amends is out of the question
When you look into his pupils and I'm the reflection - ha ha

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
Don't pretend (oh, no, oh, no)
I'm never gonna give you up (oh, no, oh, no)
I'm never gonna let you down, turn around
Don't pretend that he is just a friend
(Oh, no, oh, no)
Oh, no, I'm never gonna give you up
I'm never gonna let you down, turn around
Don't pretend that you will never love again

[Travie McCoy]
Okay, let me calm down
Here have a seat baby, maybe we can talk now
Heh~! Guess I only have one question for you
Was I just another step in the progression for you?
And if so, why ain't you tell me that?
I wouldn't have sprung forward, I'd have fell back
But I guess that's what friends are for
The only word that comes to mind is that you're nuttin but a little - brat
Open up my chest and you'll see
a cold cavity where my heart use to be
Makin amends is out of the question
When you look into his pupils and I'm the reflection - ha ha

[Chorus]

[Colin Munroe]
Don't pretend that you will never love again {*2X*}

[Travie McCoy]
We know it's nothing but the best, right?
But at night I pray to God he won't rest right
You probably think I'm still bitter, well you guessed right
How in the hell did we find ourselves in this mess, right?
I will bid farewell, boobie
Sever the ties and I'ma keep it movin
Heh! .. Yeah</pre>
