[Intro: Yukon Black, (Dragonfly)]
No, Yall took me off course too many times before
It aint happening like that no more, Fly tell em
(I'll tell you what, Lets make a deal okay, Alright, Yo.)

[Dragonfly]
I'll tell you what, Lets switch places for an hour
And you give what I give and all within your power
I'll show you the world and both sides of the equator
The science of life, Here or now, Now or later
We can, Move mountains, Plan Heaven on Earth
Watch illuminate the stars which your presence is worth huh
The worth water gives when it quenches your thirst
Or the last hoorah for chivalry for those who die first
Cause see my love is diverse, Change form within an instant
Women tend to flee like, Off into the distant
Parallel, Horizontal to what, Who, The a-alike be alike see alike the truth
He gotta lot of harmony, I guess that he does huh
Seen a lot of poverty, I guess that there was huh
So if you wanna take a journey through mines
Just bring your A game and the finest of wines okay

[Yukon Black]
I got a little advice to solve the riddles of life
For me to give it baby give me yours, Think about it, Take your time
But don't waste mine, I got an old ladies patience, Dirty old man mind
Every rhyme I got is polished priceless, Gold and shine, Ohh and I'm
Considered by the bitches as so damn fine, I've been broke without a dime
Take it as a joke but play weak for bein kind, I see in signs
What I mean is, I assign meaning to the things I find
And peace on the outside, But there's a war goin on inside
Go ahead and say something, This far from too far gone to be safe son

[Interlude: Yukon Black, (Dragonfly)]
What you think Fly, (Man if you listen I'ma tell you)

[Dragonfly]
Now she asked the question why do I, Be so passionate
Cause even if it's math you can still cause an accident
I need a women whose a lover and a friend
Who can, Fry chicken, Won't fry me in the end
Cause the way things end is never how it began
Don't mean to be negative, Don't mean to offend
But see my Earth shake the motor by the hands of time
And frankly my dear you must reflect my shine
And then walk a thin line between love and hate
Exercise your hip with lips that Earthquake
You can make a mistake but don't make it be a habit
We can make lots of babies girl I fuck like a rabbit
If you, Want a ride, It'll be my pleasure
Let me see your riches buried deep inside your treasure

[Yukon Black]
No, (A new legend) You can't go
I travel light, Bounce from broad to broad in speeds undetected by sight
I learned from my last bird, Got on my last nerve
Promised myself, Yo self, Shorties my last bird
Take another one home, That's gone, Don't be absurd
The answer to the riddle is little by little and bit by bit
K-I-T, Keep it to self, Black forget these tricks
A women in my globe means slowin my stroke, I got things to do
Anything less then a queen's shame, Ask ohhh, We done built about it
This one's the real deal, This heart's gotta sit around and kill that noise
I can't feel no more, Kill my soul, Winter's when I give up baby
Feel that cold, Feel that cold, Baby feel that cold, Feel that</pre>
