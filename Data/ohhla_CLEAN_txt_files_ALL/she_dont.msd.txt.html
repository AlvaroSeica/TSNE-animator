Song:   She Don't Live Here Anymore
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
She abandoned me
She don't live here anymore
Now the pain is gone
I'm moving on
I'm so glad to see
She don't live here anymore
And all I have is love
To keep me strong

The smell of coke and the, feel of rope
She reminded me of what could of been
She used to ease the rage by, taking a blade
And pushing til' the blood soaked her skin
And any means to, stop the dreams
Memories playing over in her mind
There was no escape, she was reliving rape
And lost and hurt and all kinds...

Growing as a young girl, in a home of much abuse
Growing as a young child, where pain replaced the truth
Growing as a young girl, where love was known as hurt
Growing as a young child, she was made to feel she had no worth

[Repeat Chorus]

Cancer ate the hair from mama's head, 4 infants dead
Never could she see past the misery
All alone in the broken home
Grief overwhelming their history
And means to, stop the dreams
They hurt so loud
They couldn't hear her cries
No escape filled with so much hate
she screamed to god almost every night

Growing as a young girl, in a home of much abuse
Growing as a young child, where pain replaced the truth
Growing as a young girl, where love was known as hurt
Growing as a young child, she was made to feel she had no worth

[Repeat Chorus]

[Chink Santana's Verse]
Mama forgive us for lying
Just trying to make it through the struggle
Forgive us for dying
We never meant to cause trouble
And I know it was hard
When every time you'd give your heart
It gets battered and scared
Now you mad at the lord
Daddy show us the way
I know it gotta be another
Convinces for something
Replace the tricking and cussing
With some kissing and hugging
Erase the visions when you sasso
Are you hitting his mother
How the fuck could you love her
And its all that you taught us
I had to break a nigga, face a nigga
If you fuck with my daughter
Heaven and hell
I swim and balling an ocean to water
I wouldn't rest 'till I called him
But then, I looked in the mirror
And his face got clear enough
How could we love him when we causing him pain
Shorty remind me of my momma
Saying daddy you've changed
Don't want my daughters thinking
Crazy with range
Niggas was cool cause the way they was raised
So I'm turning the page
And I'm sorry for the pain my black queen
We had the truth rearranged my black queen
And you so precious girl
The lord will guide you
Once you recognize the diamond inside you
Shorty you can move on

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
