[Intro]
Yo, yo ("real hip-hop") fuckin right!
("Real hip-hop") Virtuoso
("Real hip-hop") My man Khrome on the track
("Real hip-hop") It's Big Bang motherfuckers
Yo, Final Conflict shit, bitches~!
The Final Conflict ("Real hip-hop")
Uh-huh, Stevie D turn me up, turn me up
Yo yo, take that!

[Virtuoso]
Yo, yo, it's V-I-R-T, U-O-S-O
Let's go man, hand over the escrow like presto
Feel your heart pound cause your chest know
You'll see +Souls+ like T-O, Plee and Phesto
Sniper scope buck 'em down with a spiteful flow
You're hyper no, don't fuck with the titans though
They know I'm comin, start lockin doors
Cause my flow is gon' blow like Boston George
I rock the floor, cold flow freezin the jet stream
Spit so hot, whole oceans will get steamed
Wipe out marine life, machine like, Starscream fight
Your whole team bite, they stylin half and laugh
Cause it's unbelievable you ask bikers to walk a violent path
It's inconceivable when I'm strikin that you'll survive the wrath
Sometimes I ask why is the whole world strewn with peons
Then I remember they're weak meat for me to feed on
For eons we on the top of the food chain
Like Steve Martin, I'm the man with two brains
Double-headed dragon I guzzle flagons of butane
Increase the murder rate when I regurgitate and spew flames
Tackle a few trains, dropkick some airplanes
Fight and rage against the tidal waves still isn't fair game
I got the upper hand on earthquakes that crush the land
Basically, big Virtuoso is the fuckin man

[Chorus]
Real hip-hop shit, the hypnotic
Mind control when I drop the rhyme and flow
So let's go, it's Virtuoso
Let's go, it's Virtuoso
It's the real hip-hop shit, the hypnotic
Mind control when I drop the rhyme and flow
Let's go, it's Virtuoso {*2X*}
Real hip-hop shit, the hypnotic..

[Virtuoso]
Yoooo!
When you see a I-R between the V and T
with U-O-S-O on the E-N-D
That means y'all better +Run+ like +D.M.C.+
Before you in an ambulance with the EMT's
Your +Music's Factory+ made like +C&amp;C+
My crew's spittin nutrition like GNC
Faggot rappers roleplaying like D&amp;D
The janitor job, the only time you seein keys/ki's
But we, about +Business+ like +PMD+
I got a flow made to blow like TNT
We, kick in the doors like a B&amp;E
So what I'm spittin get distributed by BMG
See, we lifers where the street corner ciphers and mics in front of
thirty thousand people we put the heat to you biters
In the jungles we tigers, I was born with stripes
The earth stops spinnin when we perform with mics
I'm sworn to fight with every breath in my chest
Cause if you're, born in life then your destiny's death
And if it's, on your might see where the weapon is kept
So forget wrong or right, wear a vest on your chest
Yes, that's an invitation to war for y'all cats
Look we off the hook and they shook to call back
After all that y'all faggots gon' fall back
I hear your mouth running son but where the fuck your balls at?

[Chorus]</pre>
