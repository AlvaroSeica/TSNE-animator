(singing like Joe "I Don't Wanna Be A Player")
He don't wanna be a Muslim no more
He used to be black and proud
now he wanna be hardcore, ooh, ohh (repeat)

When I met this cat he was eatin' veggie burgers
Now you see him yo he think he about murders
I used to write his rhymes and let him shine
knowin' that he old school and out of time 
bitch made cat and yo he shot a kid
On top of that yo he got his man doin' a bid
Ex-crackhead and lived in a crackhead crib
Never sold records now he tryin' to live
But he was my man, I was the key he was a quarter gram
You like 37, lets give it up man 
you in this war you shoulda let me know
If it's war when I see you gonna let you go 
but you's a homo thug, faggot though
I hate you and the rest of y'all faggots though
So let me boost you and eat y'all niggas what you're used to
You just mad cuz you wasn't in the Juice Crew 
you a Muslim now or just used to?
Five Percent today or just used to?
Aiyyo a thug this week I guess you's too
mad cuz I cut you off cuz you was soft
I got jumped you had the gat and you didn't let off
Ice broke it up than I turned around and split off
Yeah my nigga shot the nigga in the North Face cloth
So what the fuck, watch my wyle like what
You can't rock shit
Thugged Out Entertainment we fuck you up 
all my N U straight scuff you up
And all my niggas freak bitches like me and Kurupt
Aye yo you bitin' my style fearin' my words
You ain't pro-black because you like po' white birds
Eatin' ham with your man while you in the suburbs
You like old school and washed up
I told you rhyme like a dog and put your heart up
Tell the truth, tell the truth, 
why you tellin' them lies
You goy mad cuz I was fuckin' with (?) and Nas
And you hate Nas right that's what you told me right?
Everything that he did yo you tried to bite
Don't get mad cuz you weak and he real tight
The QB niggas don't like you neither
You had dreds now you met now you got a Caesar
bitin' my style, wastin' your style
You was in for the culture how you switchin' your style
And you know it ain't over yet
Cuz me and my click will bring the rest</pre>
