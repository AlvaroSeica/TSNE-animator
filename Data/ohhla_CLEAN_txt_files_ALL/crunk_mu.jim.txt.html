[Intro: Juelz Santana]
YEAH! AY! Dip-Set bitch! Come on...
Black-out, lets do it...
Dip, dip-set!
Dip, dip, dip, dip-s
Dip, dip, dip, dip-s
Dip, dip, dip, dip

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Now this here is that bomb diggy (diggy)
Diggy dang, the dons with me
Killa, he'll a nigga you thinkin' bout harming me
Capo's corrupted (yop), he's wrong vato to fuck wit (yop)
Labeled and known as a young Pac to the public
And me, Human Crack in the flesh (flesh)
I'm the last of the best (best)
One word to describe me (what!), spectacular, YES!
So stay calm shorty, when you see that palmed .40 (.40?)
I'll pop it slow, you'll rock and roll, like Bon Jovi
So don't fool with the click (AY!)
Don't fool with the Dips (AY!)
You will die, you will lie in a pool full of shit (AY!)
When that gun with the clip in (what)
Start dumpin' and rippin' (yop)
At ya'll head, ya'll some dead summamabitches (AY!)
You give a chick hard dick and bubblegum (AY!)
I give a chick a hard brick and bubble-yum (AY!)
Like here, take that, shake that, break that (ay!)
In half and please bring my cake back

[Chorus: 1. Juelz Santana 2. Jim Jones] (repeat 2x)

2. High like space, .45 on waist

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
This is that bang, bang, bang
To my hooligan, gang
While you movin' them thangs
And ya toolies go bang (silence)

Cause I click and spray matics
And my niggas straight savage  (Gonnies!)
Penelope pump let off six whole rounds  (boom!)
'Fore  (boom!) one  (boom!) shell  (boom!) hit  (boom!) the  (boom!) ground
In the hood he known as a Capo
To the goons and the heights its all tato (TATO!)
Ok I know me some vato

Ok muchacho, they told me that you got it paco (meda)

This that 9 double 1, with a 9 double m
If its crime lets have fun, lets have fun, lets have fun

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
That rooti, tooti, fruity, Louie, what I usually do (what's this?)
This that jump, stop, breathe, whoody-who
Gats in the truck
Platt, platt, pass to a duck
I'm the menace, owe me money, tat, tat, tat, what the fuck (You owe me
money muthafucka!?)
Ya'll reppin' that 5 still
I'm reppin' that 5 mill
Neverland, Thriller, Killa Cam, Jackson 5 bill (so what!)
Lets style a bit, Italian shit, 5 thou on fish
Show you how to get that powder shit
Filed the fifth, get out of it
I'm proud of it, its yo' turn, Jim so burned
Live bitch, why kiss, on my wrist a glowworm ($50,000)
And I keep heat, cause in these streets (what you hear?)
Just hear woop, woop, whant, whant, beep, beep (that's the cops)
And you rumble, never, me, hit a humble diva (a few of 'em)
And I stay with the white, I got Jungle Fever (nose candy)
So tell Lucccaay (what)
That her boobi's, loco, cookie monster, who he (who am I?)
I'm the 1 the rep the set
Left to left, death to death
You be yellow-taped, outlined, etch-a-sketched...
Killa
