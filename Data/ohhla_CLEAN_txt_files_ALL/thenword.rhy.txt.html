Song:   The 'N Word'
Typed by: @RhymeAsylum

(N, The N is nigh, It's now or never)

[Verse: Possessed]
I'm negative nether world native
Nirvana nemesis, put necks in nooses not necklaces
Navigate NebaKanezer ship
Neo, so shots from nickel-plated nines never hit
Ninth gate novelist 
Necromancer, raise Napoleon from my necropolis
Non-descript nameless nomad
The nightmare referred to in Nostradamus's notepads 
(Nexus) no nationality
Play noughts and crosses, as I knock nails in the Nazarene 
Naturally there's no one nicer than me 
As I nap my zees are rotated ninety degrees
Sunk navy deeper than Neptune
Neutralize your next of kin, neighbours, nieces and nephews
A nocturnal ninja network
Notice I never needed to say the notorious 'N Word'

[Chorus]
'N Word' never need to say it
Don't believe it, then rewind it and replay it
Nefarious, neurotic narrator
I'm not naughty (Nah) I'm nasty by nature         
'N Word' never need to say it
Don't believe it, then rewind it and replay it
Nefarious, neurotic narrator
I'm not naughty (Nah) I'm nasty by nature</pre>
