[Sample]
It's very difficult to know if...
Northerners are puppets, or...
They are innocent, or...
They are the masterminds

[Canibus]
These are +Liquid Wordz

Yo, I come through on cold steel on back of the snowmobile
I just came back from shogun hill
Make you kneel, face the wall
Shoot you in the back of the head with some paint balls
'Til your brains are gon'
Attack dawg, attack man, only respond to German commands
Completely bite off the burglar's hands
Triangular death, that's where I purchased the land
Built the ranch, strude deep into the Earth through the sand
Send the clergy emissary to the cemetery
You requested to be buried, with your bones to carry
I'm blood sample savvy, I name your first clone Jerry
Your second clone Harry, and your third clone after me
The fourth clone could battle him after he battles me
But your the fifth clone can only be used to tattle me
This is called microphone savagery
+Press Play+, I attack the beat, you'll tap out or tap to leap
But we do not have to beef, before the Greeks captured Crete
I was known as the master of the beat
Sidonian MC speak, rudimentary speech
I released the Canaanite beast and sent 'em to the East
To walk through the streets sharin' thoughts about God and my beliefs
+Heavy Mental+ it was authored by the Priest
We were tortured by the palm trees in the Palm Sunday breeze
It was 0 0 1 A.D.

[Sun]
Yo, it's been a long time comin', but I'm finally here
Solidify my spot and I ain't gon' nowhere (C'mon)
'Cause Ripper Mics been only 'vice
So I return like Christ, to resurrect the art of spittin' nice
The true and livin' it, physical form
Grab the mic and I - spit up a storm
Tracks get beasted, MC's get eaten
I blast paragraph from rough draft - the thesis
With strong facial features, lip and gap teeth's
I see through your feces like telekinesis
Build with Killah Priest in the chamber of Gizas
Special Ops Hip-Hop get chopped in pieces
Zero degree Celsius liquid will freeze
But at any temperature, settle melt MC's
That's why Canibus handed me the scrolls for infinity
What he actually gave me was the moment of clarity
It's complex simplicity, self-contradictory
Philosophical speak about the God and men mystery
'Cause we've been fooled by religion and history
'Cause the path to eternity, starts eternally
Accordin' to the Sun God, the time is at hand
For me to reveal the man, exactly who +I Am...+
I'm the apostles, we writin' The Bible and Ebonics
I'm Elijah Muhammad that'll sell chronic
Martin Luther with a German Lugar
I'm Malcolm X on your project steps bustin' a tec
Gandhi with a MPC, who MC madd nice
I'm Christ in his cipher shootin' dice

[Killah Priest]
Inside my mind is bad weather
So when I brainstorm it'll rain strong
To Hurricane's swarm in a form of paragraph
Start from the corner of the pages in my pad
And nothin' could withstand the rhyme, when it rages in its path
But I don't brainwash my listeners
My lyrics give 'em a bath, without bars or soap
These are bars of quote, that'll take you so far you'll choke
What I have is like Lightening in a bottle
Deep as the writin' of Aristotle
Like Picasso but it's a novel
Spittin' in bars and flows, Priest the dark Dragon King
Spittin' graphic scenes, my .16 should be seen on plasma screen
My black wings are The Lord of the Rings
While my sword is bathin' and y'all scream
Swallowed your flesh to his metal intestine
If he's so much, on your rebels that became congested
And gnarls on modes, snarls at thrones, carve out domes
Somewhere in a giant stone King where the interest is big enough
To accommodate a Pterodactyl in flight
Priest sit and the Tabernacle will write
While Jackals fight over the poison Emperor's body
Priest and Canibus enjoy their memorable army's
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

[Canibus]
A lyricist without with no master, a no financer
After the disaster I will die from laughter
Alright, let's move out people
I got a five ton diesel, 40 illegal
Hazmat retreat, too deep to say piece to
I pray about peace for you
Very soon the Goetia will eat you
The keys of Solomon will open the door to that bottomless prison
And let the Leviathan army in
+Liquid Wordz+, split superb
From the foothills of Sykros to the streets of New Jerz
New Ark, I'm the rare admiral in New York
If I'm caught they'll award the post human purple heart
Navy cross neva say we lost, Dan Abram office and court
One o'tnot to think any thoughts, +Liquid Wordz+
