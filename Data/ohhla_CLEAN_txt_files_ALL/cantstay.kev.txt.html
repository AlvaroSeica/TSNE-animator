[Intro] [Phonte talking]
Yo, check it out right now. Bringin' it to you once again
live and direct to you and yours, it's Phonte from Little Brother
Peace to my mans Big Pooh and 9th Wonder
My man Grap Luva. K Brown on the track. We gonna set it like this yo

[Verse One] [Phonte]
Yo for 2003
Beats and rhymes so arising in me
Feelin' all of God's blessings as they showering me
Makin' my voice pro-ject like public housin', and we
Grap Luva and K Brown gonna give you somethin' to see
Tay's in the game now, what's nothin' to me?
Nigga claim they have my back, sound like they was frontin' with me
With fake smiles and uneasy glances
Lookin' at me like I'm the nigga who upset their chances
Out in the game gettin' stepped on and still tryin' to press on
C'mon niggas
You just wack fucker, you ain't gettin' slept on
And I ain't tryin' to be foul or stuck up
But you gotta know when to call it quits
Tell your man to pull the truck up
Break the studio down and go and call your cuz up
Another beat machine you don't never need to plug up
That nigga Tay is known to bring the ruckus
Still takin' time to write rhymes and learn lessons from my fuck ups

[Grap Luva]
Don't loose sight of the picture
Peep the scripture
In my possession is the ultra elixir 
Feel the healin' y'all
These contents, yo, they never under pressure
Had 'em fooled, thinkin' you was greater and I was lesser
Please
Kid you better refocus yourself quick
Comin' at me all slick, you need to dead that shit
I'm here standin' firm, reppin' this straight from the heart
With Phonte we rip the party apart
(Chill, don't spill your drinks cousin)
We make you boogie up in Hammerstein
Where people clamor just to hear our rhymes
Spittin' these lines, simply designed
What's sonically right
We know you feelin' it
Fiendin' for Kev's sound but for now you just VIBE

[Chorus] [Phonte]
All across the globe we make the people say
(Oooh yeah)
And up in the club we make the ladies say
(Alright)
Showin' love on the track and take the hate away
(Alright)
For everybody maintainin' on the day to day
Y'all just can't stay away
we make the people say
(Oooh yeah)
And up in the club we make the ladies say
(Alright)
Showin' love on the track and take the hate away
(Alright)
Maintainin' cause I just can't stay away</pre>
