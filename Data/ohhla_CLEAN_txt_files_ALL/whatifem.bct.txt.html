Yo yo!

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jinglin' all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride from Detroit to East LA

Verse 1:

Is this a white Christmas, hell no my man!
I'm leavin' blood in the snow and smackin' fat men
You mean Santa? That boy's a b****
He caught my mom Christmas Eve and tried to give her a ****
For real, he's no joke, the guy don't play
He tried to **** way more than a one-horse sleigh
Laughin' all the way, but he's not laughin' today
We'll jingle more than his b**** even the elves will pay 
Come Christmas Eve, ol' Nick's a gonner
Well be snackin' on deer e****' Blitzen and Donner
Not a question of when, not even a maybe
Have a drunk Miss Claus say "they jinglin', baby!" (hey hey)
Givin' new meaning to Ho-ho-ho
Shake that a**, girl, bumpin' booty in the snow
So watch out Santa, you jolly old troll
Well be strippin' that sleigh and leave you the coal

Chorus:
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jinglin' all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a drop-top Chevrolet (yo yo)
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jinglin' all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride from Detroit to East LA

Verse 2:
You playin' reindeer games? Hell yeah, my friend!
Grab Rudolph's horns and see how far they bend
When his nose turns red his a** gets sent 
Back out to the woods with his f**** elf Randall
Santa Claus wouldn't list me as nice
In fact, he'll have me listed as naughty twice
Not cuz of the fights or Christmas gift heist
But because of all the Nog I left on his wife
It's time for Old Nick to move and retire
Before we roast his n*** on a big ass fire
Yes I'm that bad, yes I'm that crude
I mean yo' ass is huge, lose weight for real dude (ohh!)
All the cookies and milk simply quite sick
I mean, whens the last time you seen your d***?
I dont mean to throw a fit, and Im not one to bitch
But every year, I get underwear, socks and sh*t.

Chorus 2:
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jinglin all the way
(Check it out, jingle these bells, bay-bee)
Oh what fun it is to ride in a drop-top Chevrolet
(Yeah, you know what Im sayin', I'mma bring it to you, blow it out, word up, like this, like this)
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jinglin all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride from Detroit to East LA

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jinglin all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a drop-top Chevrolet (yo yo)
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jinglin all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride from Detroit to East LA</pre>
