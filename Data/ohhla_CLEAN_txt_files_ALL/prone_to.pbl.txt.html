Hah... hell, what's up, fool?
It's me, your conscience, motherfucker...
You been making some fucked up moves...
I understand you live your life in a journey but if ya
dreams try to fake me you better wake your ass up...
What's your motherfuckin problem, nigga?

Yo, I'm prone to bad dreams so I sleep in a straight-jacket
Society labels me as mentally reactic
So they put me in the halfway home
And for 10 long years doctors fucked with my dome
Shooting dope in my arm just to calm me
Strapped to the bed cause I'm scared that nurses might harm me
Capable of doing almost anything
Tearin holes in my mattress just to play with the box springs
I can't eat the certain food cause it hypes me
It types me full of negative energy; I feel funny
Something must be wrong with my clothes
Either my shoes' too tight, either I got too many toes
Man, I don't know when my mind lingers
Haven't ate all day but yet and still I'll eat my fingers
Damn, I know I see my homeboy right in front of me
But the staff laughed you see 
they think I was talkin to myself and asked:
"Can we meet your homeboy?" I say it's too late: he just left
But we can catch him if we look out the window
"What window?" God damn it, can't you see that damn window?
"Calm down, Point Blank... okay, he went home, now look..."
I turned around and the window was gone
Then I dropped to my knees and I cried
Touched the wall, the window was gone, I could've died
Slowly but surely I look up
Now I know that they know I know that my mind's fucked up
Please, if ya can't cure me, Doc
Just put me to sleep and run a knife through my body, Doc
Steady having flashbacks of homicide scenes
So I sleep in a straight-jacket cause I'm prone to bad dreams...

"...at night I can't sleep..." -&gt; Scarface
Wake your ass up...Wake your ass up...
"...at night I can't sleep..." -&gt; Scarface
Wake your ass up...Wake your ass up...

Prone to bad dreams so I sleep in a straight-jacket...
"...at night I can't sleep, I toss and turn..." -&gt; Scarface
Prone to bad dreams so I sleep in a straight-jacket...
"...at night I can't sleep, I toss and turn..." -&gt; Scarface

Waking from a deep sleep jumping to my fucking feet
Reading in the paper: 5 deads found in the street
Did I kill'em? Was it me? Am I a killa? Can it be? I think it was
But fuck that shit, it call come back...
Bit by bit, burning bodies at the stake
Watch them bleed, watch them shake
Smell the smoke, hear the pain
I bet you think that I'm insane
I was born stillborn but my mama didn't mourn
I fell out in a field so I'm a child of the corn
Triple-six is in my head, the number of the beast
I react murder acts, therefore they keep me on a leach
So I nail them on the wall and stab them in the face
I'm definitely insane so it's no murder case
Left em in the house and on the wall they rotted
You ask about the bodies? Should I say the rest?
They got it but fuck them, I won't sweat it, I live and I forget it
Nigga got away with a murder, caught a habit and I fed it...
To the fullest in this verse, his blood is what I thirst
Punk bitch, fronting like you are hard, fuck it, kill him first
Even tho' I got mood swings it's not what it seems
Point Blank's just a motherfucka prone to bad dreams...

"...at night I can't sleep..." -&gt; Scarface
Wake your ass up...Wake Your ass up...
"...at night I can't sleep..." -&gt; Scarface
Wake your ass up...Wake Your ass up...

Prone to bad dreams so I sleep in a straight-jacket...
"...at night I can't sleep, I toss and turn..." -&gt; Scarface
Prone to bad dreams so I sleep in a straight-jacket...
"...at night I can't sleep, I toss and turn..." -&gt; Scarface</pre>
