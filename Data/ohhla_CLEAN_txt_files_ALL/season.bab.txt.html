"Duck Season motherfuckers"
"Duck"
That's right, that's real
That's right, that's real
Intoxicated demons
"Hustler from the Queens borough it's Big Psych" -&gt; Beatnuts Forever
Babu, yeah

[Verse 1: Psycho Les]
Off the hizzle watch it sizzle peroxide
Slash my cock between your eyes, now you cock-eyed
Cocksucker you can't fuck with the Nuts
Ask your girl cause she's sucking the nuts
Everytime I swing my punch connects
So stop frontin' show the Beatnuts respect
Hating on your nextdoor neighbour
That's why I have your ears in pain when you heard my flavour
It's Big Psych, JuJu, Babu with a brand new song
We blazing chron', like Cheech and Chong
It's a freak of ton squeezing cheeks and tongues
Dropping bombs on heavy base BOOM, now your speaker's gone
Don't know you should've known
It's the original Psycho and the other ones are clones

[Verse 2: JuJu]
Pass the fucking mic, yeah
Big motherfucking Ju in the house, my man Psych
"JuJu"
You heard!
"World famous"
Here's what every MC want to be
Exclusive conceed there ain't no ordinary part of me
Look in my eyes it ain't hard to see
I punk fear in every goddamn coronary artery
Big guns, big drums slow bangin'
Allstars gonna have big thing coach wagon
Metal man party and junk, it gonna happen
See hard Intoxicated overlord rappin'
Come on money what you hearing
Hoe's wannabe X-File when niggas just start disappearing
JuJu make it hard to breath
I understand niggas couldn't have heart
If it came in the can
Niggas act funny I just love money
and my life is a reflection of that
Aite? DUMMY
Scary expensive my wardrobe very extensive
Let's face it Jerry is eccentric

[Verse 3: Al' Tariq (Fashion)]
Yeah yeah fuck y'all thought baby boys
Waited in New York
Who want to rumble with the KA
No good to playa, no hood to slaya
Get flooded in my daylights
They lose paya do chaos
And if you with it from the junk to saos
See me my pore find your spleen on the floor
Punk one Duck One got your team on the floor
You never seen me before
You them ding with your men's
You don't know me like y'all see my face again
You see my face again if y'all about witnessing
You be judge, DA, you tongue block pissing him
One shot whistling him left off whistling
Crack the dome faced off like nicking him
Son, out the cage you saw my rage
It's big boy toys, baby, talking glocks and gages
And my haps contagious spit flues to them crew
Please believe it reeking that doo Babu

Who!
You heard motherfuckers?
