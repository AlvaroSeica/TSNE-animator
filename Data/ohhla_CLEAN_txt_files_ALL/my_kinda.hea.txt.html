[Lil' Fame]
Let me just hit you off (HIT 'EM!) with the real
My steel sing like opera, and open your fuckin head like a doctor
(DO WHATCHA GOT-TA) Holdin it down for (NEW YORK CITY)
We'll blow back your whole rap comittee
My Squad knock, make you wannabe hardrocks smoother
and move ya, with itchy trigger finger maneuvers
(You best get your steel) for these B-Ville sluggers
Cause gun shells really tell who shot motherfuckers
You gon' need protection when flexin, word to mother
I'm the reflection of my deceased brother
Flows are metamorphosed, keepin you hoes rippin off clothes
Smokin you soft hoes with or without a fo'-fo'
(HEART COLD AS THE NORTH POLE) And I be bangin 'em and tamin 'em
Crackin your cranium is Lil' Fame and them
(BLAOW!) The ill steel hitters
(FIRING SQUAD, FIRING HARD) My kinda niggaz!

[H] The type of individuals that smoke trees and pour mad liquor
[M] My kinda nigga!
[H] The type to tighten up your whole mouthpiece if ya talk gets slicka
[M] My kinda nigga!

[D] My kinda nigga!

From the, other side of the Hudson water
A nigga's daughter on some aw (FUCK IT TYPE ORDER)
Caught a charge pissin bitches off somethin decent
Now find me WILDIN at the 54th precinct
I fucks with niggaz with braids and with no cuts
Niggaz that'll pull a heist and split 'cho front
Puttin plugs in fake thugs hollerin street
I'm devil-eyed from lye and two hours of sleep
Bitch niggaz walk around like they RUGGED
Stacks of boom bap and I know you don't want it
I'm a wild nigga (WHAT?) Crack the Heine', twist the dutch
My type of niggaz just stay fucked up

[Billy Danze]
Here's a nigga that's no joke
All-American gunslinger that's dead broke
The thug nigga that's stuck on the frontline
(?? ??) parked sparkin a nickel nine
Never regret what he did
Nigga flip a eight month sentence to a TWELVE YEAR BID
Be Presidential in your residential
Show them niggaz what you into, use your potential
Slang yo' dope nigga (SLANG YO' CRACK)
Go on! (THAT'S WHERE IT AT!) That's where you get it at fool
Yo' kinda nigga (love) yo' kinda nigga (trust)
My kinda nigga is the NIGGA THAT'S GON' BUST
