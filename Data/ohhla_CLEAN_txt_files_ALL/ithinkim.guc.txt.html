[Intro/Chorus: Jason Caesar]
I think I'm in love love love {*3X*}
Love love (yeahhhh)
She think she in love love love {*3X*}
She falling in love

[Gucci Mane]
Canary diamonds on my fist, on wrist and on my neck
Ms. Lady say she know my name and I ain't even told her yet
No need to introduce myself, I let my money do the greeting
So conceited, that if she ain't worth talkin to then I'm not speakin (Gucci~!)
I'm so single, ay let's mingle, can I buy you some champagne?
And my sex game gladiator, tell me, "Are you entertained?"
I'm an +Entertainer+ baby but my name ain't +Cedric+
I got cheddar and et cetera so stop the rhetoric
But enough about me baby, sweetie tell me 'bout ya self
Are you married or divorced, don't gotta tell me that's yo' choice
I like your voice I like your swag, so let nature take its course
Maybe in the future gorgeous I can buy yo' ass a Porche, Gucci!

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Don't be shy, you and I, me and you can be as one
I can't lie, won't deny, every time wit'chu is fun
In Dubai, London, Paris baby we can watch the sun
set and rise, or just lay back on the beach and watch the sky (Gucci~!)
She's been sent to me, lent to me, I feel she is God's gift to me (yeahhh)
It's Gucci Mane, on the mic while Zay control the symphony
No twistin it, she swichin it, but she not all promiscuous
It's obvious, she's marvelous, and wants to be a part of this
I give her one thousand percent but this that 50/50 shit
I'm wealthy and I'm gealthy so cut off that boy you kick it with
Give her one thousand percent but this that 50/50 shit
I'm wealthy and I'm healthy so cut off that lame you kick it with

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Dinner date, please don't be late, I'm fiendin I don't wanna wait
Sex so hot and passionate it'll make her hyperventilate
Yea, I'ma bachelor but I'm workin on my masters
And no I'm not a doctor but my money go way past one
She's hotter than my last one, sexy like my last chick
I'm checkin out her assets, her ex-boyfriend is past tense
I talk to her, I listen to her, text her then she text me
I rap to her, she wanted me, and damn her walk is sexy
Our last night was so good I think about her next day
Mo' blunt than fo' ashtrays, she told me boy you crazy
Burnin all my candles and lightin all my incense
I'm givin her my imprint cause damn I like her accent

[Chorus]

[Outro]
She's fallin in love
Hey hey hey hey hey {*2X*}
She's fallin in love {*2X*}
Hey~!</pre>
