[Intro]
Pretty Boys, rich boys, young boys, 100 thousand nigga, 100 million
We came to shut shit down, SOD nigga, hunned thousand, base

[Chorus]
It's a new [?] Swag, twerkin hard, work hard
Oh my god goddamn I'm rich, rich bitch

Rich Bitch [x8]

[Verse 1]
Damn I'm rich bitch and I'm spendin all thousands
Trap money good but the rap money pilin'
Superstar bitches on my dick cause I'm reckless
Young based god used to ride stolen Lexus
Young back seat with the driver and the alcohol
Limousine look like the club in the back of it
Strip em cold wake my bitches up like a mattress
Straight West Berkley Cal bear man what's happenin
Nigga been thuggin but I quit do the rappin
Bruh said I'm snitchin I can't see that happenin
Now we talkin pretty money pretty boys at a million
Cut my damn check trickin off in a dominican

[Chorus]
It's a new [?] Swag, twerkin hard, work hard
Oh my god goddamn I'm rich, rich bitch

Rich Bitch [x8]

[Verse 2]
Bitch ass hoes on the floor like a wallet
All my bitches gay and they love to suck dick bruh
Baddest bitch out fuck her head cause I'm sick bruh
Young based god I'm comin clean and I'm swaggin
Basedlord nigga I go dumb and I rachet
Twenty thousand dollars for a show man what's happenin
With a barbie bitch and she look like plastic
With some blonde hair this is deeper than that rappin
Pull up two seater feelin, like I made it
I ain't made shit till the bank start to hate me
Straight waterfront nigga mad cause I made it
Your bitch suckin dick and y'all suckers keep hatin'

[Chorus]
It's a new [?] Swag, twerkin hard, work hard
Oh my god goddamn I'm rich, rich bitch

Rich Bitch [x8]

[Verse 3]
Based world nigga comin clean till I came
She's so wet just like my new paint
Hit my weed man with the grapes and the philly
Philly and it tighten, tighter than a bad bitch
Stripper in a mansion and I'm running like a felon
What it do brah I'm checkin trap with that melon
But I don't got hoes I only pimp bars
And ain't Lil' B doin numbers like a boss
Soulja boy tell 'em better tell em we on fire
Pretty boy mob rich niggas can't get higher
Pretty boy click got a clip with the thirty round
Pretty boy click make your girlfriend lay it down

[Chorus]
It's a new [?] Swag, twerkin hard, work hard
Oh my god goddamn I'm rich, rich bitch
