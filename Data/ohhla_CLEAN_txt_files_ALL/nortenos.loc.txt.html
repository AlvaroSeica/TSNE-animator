[Speedy Loc]
Ever since a youngsta I was gang related
The Norte Cama Islands I was affiliated
At a very young age I was down for mine
Throwin' up the 1-4 fuckin' every time
We beat them vatos down in them old days
It was hella crazed in the barrio I was raised
So we packed the gat in this town that I'm at
Decoto Killafornia where their homies be strapped
We rolled hella deep
Cuatro carros on the creep
Lookin' for a scrapa 'bout to put him to sleep
Cuz us Norte単os love to put in work
Kill a fuckin' scrap and leave his ass in the dirt
And then they wonder
Why they goin' up under us
Sport the wrong color
Get you hit like thunder
Until my death I hold my rag up high
I'll be a Norte単o til the day I die

[Chorus]
Straight northsider and we're buckin' 'em down
End it til I die representin' Dodge Town
Two Decoto loc's coming from the bay
Where scrap killins' all day everyday

[Bandit]
Yo just touchdown from the bay
See for silly
West Coast riders now I know you're feelin' me
We struggle done hit the streets
Structure comin' through
You sellin' dope
You better be sellin' for my crew
Mind straight
Conteplatin' on how and to clock a grip
Northside soldiers behind the walls
They claim we don't slip
I gots Young Speedy by my side
Now I'm ready to ride
We're in the camarada studio representin' northside
I'm known to take no shit
And settle petty issues
Call one shot and make your own folks diss you
Rippin' tissue
We'll leave your body twitchin' punk
Blood just spittin' up
Whole team of killers
Three strike candidates
So there ain't no givin' up
Slept two hours this weak
Prayin' to the gods til my lyrics peak
Somethin' to the fake players in the game
Lying to pull a ho
East Bay Gangster I know you know my name bro
Bandit, a real killer from the bay
No love for D-O's that's what I'll say

[Chorus]

[Speedy Loc]
Now look into the eyes of killa on the realla
Northside ridah creepin' wit the milla
Jackin' scrilla
Red hangin', norte単o bangin'
Who-ridin' on these scraps and slangin'
I ain't never been a punk
So just take a trip through Decoto Killafornia
Where we pack them clips in
You can catch us hella deep up in the low-ride
Creepin' through the bay throwin' up northside
And I'll be puttin' it down from Decoto to Oaktown
Back to Frisco, San Jo, and Richtown
And every north city that's all flamed up
Where they're ready to buck and cut and not give a fuck
Cuz in that east bay scraps are straight gettin' stuck
Shanked like a mutha fucka thrown in the cuts
And we be doin' dirt and these sur's can't stand it
It's me Speedy Loc and that older homie Bandit

[Chorus]</pre>
