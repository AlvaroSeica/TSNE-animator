[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever
They wont leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me

Allow me to break down the game
behind the bracelets, earrings, chains, watches and rings
The bling
the crystal incrusted, princess flooded
canary studded, blue colored and blood stained
Yeah, the older brother of the drug game
the giver of fame, the take awayer of lame
The empowerer of the kings that came with claims and disease
to leave where the native peoples were staying
Believe, my engagement ring received
And flossed at the cost of a bondage child minus pain
Long ago kings use to wear them in their armor when they fought other armies
Because it use to scare them
If you wasn't rich, couldn't wear them
Witches use to marry them
They'll shoot you before they share them
The gift and the curse, the venom and the serum
Most hated lady's best friend, get murked for a cerium

[Chorus]

Cecil Rhodes sold war and genocide
Into the countryside just to get his shine on
I fear what De Beers and his peers use to do
Before the world really knew, just to get their mine on
Making paper with slave labor
And hitting little kids with life time bids making them cut and shine stones
Inflating the price and making them look nice
And I wasn't thinking twice when I was putting mine on
About a young shorty in Sierra Leone
Or other conflict countries that people call home
I figured I would never go to Angola
So it never did affect me there, maybe indirectly
That my neck leash was funding a rebellion or a military coup
Started by militias that don't believe in following none of Geneva's rules
I was brushing off the haters, trying to be cool
Didn't have a clue that the rapper was helping the rapers
Raiders of the villagers, pillagers of the schools
Shooters of the innocent, torturers of the witnesses
Burners of the businesses and my bracelet was the fuel
Uhh, I ain't pushing an agenda homie
I'm just pushing the facts, fuck Bush
Cuz there's people doing worse on this earth and there black
I took it for years now let me bring it back
We all know on foreign shores that they finance wars
But ask yourself do they finance yours
When I first got mine I took them out on tour
Didn't know they lost half the value when I took them out the store
Or it was full of moissanites and cubics
But the jeweler knew I was stupid
And that I couldn't prove it
Feeling like I need it because I do music
To impress the groupies and the interviewers
So I didn't appraise it, nor did I loop it
Even gave them to my girl, thinking I was cupid
Homies was all hate hoping they could make me lose it
Creeping through my own hood knew I had to remove it
I see the Russian Mafia, the Jewish Mobsters
The undercover terrorists and the traps for the hustlers
Homie it's a wrap for the nonsense rhyming
Props to Kanye I call this Conflict Diamonds
