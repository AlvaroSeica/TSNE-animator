I wanna dedicate this song
To anybody that's ever felt pain
Anybody that's ever went through sorrow
Anybody that's ever went through change
This is from me to you
Ha Ha here we go...

It's amazing, no longer am I raising hell up on the streets
I got a child up in the creep homie
I'm only seventeen, I'm still a young man
I'm in the streets watching fools get sprung man
I'm wearing jail clothes, my mother rose
Taught me how the wind blows, my mother knows
All about the struggles, all about the troubles
All about your pain every time I hear the rain
I cry and I cry to the clouds up in the sky
And oh how I wish that you would've never died
I wish that you were here, I wish that you could see
The man that I've become, I got a little one
I named her after you, and all because of you
I sit here and I write this, everyday I fight this...situation
Damn how I miss you, wherever you may be I know that God blessed you

[Chorus]
Everyday we grow everyday it shows
Give yourself a little bit of time and you'll find
You best believe (best believe best believe) that
Cause if you don't then you lose

Now a few years passed, and I've grown to be a man
No longer set tripping I got myself a plan
It's all about the money, it's all about the G's
It's all about me providing for my family
I had a little pad, my daughter called me Dad
My lady always said never did I have a care
My life was the bomb, I had it going on
But never did I think I'd have to put it in a song
Staying out late, making mistakes
Hanging out with no-good Nicklebag Snakes
Taking them for granted, and no I didn't plan it
But till the day they're gone is the day you'll understand it
Now I drink booze, still I won't lose
Wanna be a fighter, a gangster-rap writer
A fool from the streets making sure you get the creeps
Every single time that I pop up in your mind

[Chorus]
Everyday we grow everyday it shows
Give yourself a little bit of time and you'll find
You best believe (best believe best believe) that
Cause if you don't then you lose

Well, now it's ninety-nine, I'm running out of time
But still I see these fools always throwing up their signs
Sit and reminisce, about the Smith and Wesson
And how I will be quick to show these fools a lesson
Not that I won't G, but I best be
Well aware of all the time that I won't see
Twenty-five, thirty with an L, trying to a daddy from a cell
"Farewell," is what you better say to the one you're thinking of
Is what you better say to the woman that you love
Cause now you got some issues, and even though you miss her
She will find another mother fucker to kiss her
Another one to hug, another one to love her
And every single day, doing time, you're thinking of her
Watch what you do, and who you do it to
Cause way before you know, they'll do it back to you

[Chorus Out]
Everyday we grow everyday it shows
Give yourself a little bit of time and you'll find
You best believe (best believe best believe) that
Cause if you don't then you lose</pre>
