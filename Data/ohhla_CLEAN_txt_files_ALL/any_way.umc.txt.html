Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Verse One]
Well it came to my attention, many had slept on the U
(Even so, show 'em that you kept on and grew)
Yeah I did, this is from a flow and yes a master
Wu-Tang blower on the board
You pass the microphone to the UMC Hasi'
And leave me with no other choice (and what)
So I flow it for the posse (right)
That would include, the Kunis and me
It surely includes, Prophet and Kwase
No doubt it includes, my little brother Krunch
RNS, Big Burn and Little Munch
Thrust from a place of almighty man U and scar
any invader who would dare try invade the (shocker)
Cipher which is kept for self, meant to share with no one else
Analyze it, and you'll see why we say the
U man's the true man (exact) we shout it
from the highest mountaintop, so there, they can't stop

[Chorus]
"Any way the wind blows... it's cool with me" {*2X*}

[Verse Two]
Well now, you're solo and released a hurricane
So call me the wind that win (all hail) on a newfound plain
of reality, this is the Prince and his talent G
Ability, the windswept plains of fertility
Mental, my menace is contagious
(Yes sober phrases in a manner which befits one so courageous)
I spark from the Isle' as a breeze
Bend to cosmic wind, it's Kim... begin

Up along the ground, we blow leaves
Go deep into the roots and then blow trees
(Question - who exactly were the ones who "Blue Cheese?")
It was the Kool and me and I see the cheese freeze (Freeze~!)
Am I powerful? "Uh-huh"
Posess the skills the many lack? "Uh-huh"
Would you say somethin grand? "Uh-huh"
That'll blow many back? "Uh-huh"
Back into the year of 1989
When the UMC expressed the newly rated rhymes
As a result of flav', we played the game bound to blow
An entirely different new expression

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
"Do the breakdown... come on in" {*4X*}

[Verse Three]
It starts as a rumble and a roar and soon
You quiver in fear of the doom, the boom of the typhoon
My tidal wave, my tidal thought wave that washes through
the multitudes, sits the birth of the first youth
Thirty cycles later came the second one
Two cents from afar and now become stars and sun
So watch as the Earth rotates a new time
Pushed and pulled, through a hurricane of rhymes
So let the wind blow, it's Kool with Kim
(Hour after hour 'til the tide comes in)
Then back to the nest of the first crew baskin
I fight with lyricals focused and past its form
Beyond norm, I storm with the power
Then chill on the hill with a breeze of sunflower
Kim's the guy to win, the wind it blows
You hear my voice in the breeze and then it blows

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
