[Rob O]
Yeah yeah wake it up all my niggaz
In the cut this going to all my  my
Yo what I am saying wonderlust
Check it out and yeah ya don't

[Verse 1: Rob O]
I put feelings aside I know I am
Hesitation wasn't of the plan
See the R to the O B, O the God cipher
Controversial rhyme writer who rhyme tighter
Who shine brighter make moves and manipulate
Educate vocabulary and articulate
Writing shit at will while can't relate
Instead of rushing make ya wack ass wait
Robodeno enormous lyrical with endurance
Coming with the slick performance
Now check the chorus
Unpredictable still so y'all wack niggaz chill
I bubble with the underground mass appeal
Constantly ya know the God be beatin it up see
We got it through out new york chaotic
Wild style retarded movements like robotic
Coming with the press that moves pride of
Wonderlust

Wonderlust and ya don't stop
For all my niggaz in the cut yeah yeah
To all my people I trust yeah wonderlust
Yeah yeah ya don't stop
For all my niggaz in the cut
Uh wonderlust

[Verse 2: Rob O]
All these beats with my rhymes attached
Form a new creation that y'all catch
But check it I won't sweat it
Give ya corny ass credit
The God gettin athletic I am copacetic
Unpredictable supreme factor super spectacular
Sparklin like crystal with this style
Wow ya average attempts is minimal
See adrenaline pumps through the heart and
Most chumps when Rob O
Time and follow through presentation
Writing rhymes like ya equation
From punctuation the trumpcation
I keep it fly nigga face it
Now quote this conversation
Dope rap component topple many opponents
Solo microphonist yo who's next to hold this
Robo o yes yes y'all phenomenal next plateau
Unsur mountable

Yeah yeah to all MC's to get open

[Verse 3: Rob O]
Check it out
Now rappers ask yourself same question
Why I am dope in this profession
Is because I don't front or pretend yo
Or is it because I am that nigga robodendo
The captain of the platinum voice of top choice
From Manhattan over Japan and all points
Magnificent like contrary all the hype
Plain and simple it's time to grab the mic it's on
Verses paragraph like correspond like the Qu'ran
You witnessing the discipline like Islam
Steadily in aggressive excel like I expected
Lyrically you're not impressive
Guess who's next it's Rob O east coast uptown
McC the most I am spreadin Necca all around
Selecting the sound I make party people how to DJ and mix
The shit ya like that wonderlust lust lust lust

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
