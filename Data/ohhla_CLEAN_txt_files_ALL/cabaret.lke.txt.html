[Intro: Justin]
Hey, hey, hey, c'mon
Havin too much fun right now, c'mon, uhh

[Justin Timberlake]
She's got a secret, but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage, with the lights low
Cause you already dropped the bullet, turned it into something major

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Now can we, discuss, how fast you just got undressed
Girl if sex is a contest, then you're comin first
And - don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when the curtains close
It's a

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake] + (Timbaland)
Cabaret (put on a show) ohh-ohh (get on the flo')
Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret (put on a show) ohh-ohh (get on the flo')
You're giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
Ohh-ohh (put on a show) hey (get on the flo')
Hohh-ohh (get on the flo') hey (get on the flo')
Ohh-ohh (put on a show) hey (get on the flo')
Hohh-ohh; you're giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

[Justin Timberlake]
(C'mon) Fantasy, play the role
And all these new moves I like, you got me feelin like a stranger
Say my name, do you know
Cause I got you saying Jesus so much it's like we're laying in a manger

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Drake] + (Timbaland)
Okay, this just in girl the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long 'til you get off of work, but listen
I got some better positions for you that's takin so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Do my touchdown dance in it, no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight, you're kryptonite
Should probably have a cape to throw on
Uh, on my Eddie Murphy +Boomerang+ for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doin two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do the thing to ya, girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know
I'll keep a secret for ya (break it down)
I'm tryin to +Ease Yo' Mind+, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom
That was there when I moved in
Heh, okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there or it's mine?
You the girl that's gon' be there when it's marryin time
And I'ma fuck you like we havin an affair - I swear
It's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffin you though
Presidential shit, girl you up on the polls/poles
Say that this a private show, ooh boy don't start
Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault
North Pole boy from the T-O
They ain't really ready for that me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watchin every single move like casinos
She know~!

[Chorus] - first 1/2

[Justin Timberlake] + (Timbaland)
Ohh-ohh (put on a show) hey (get on the flo')
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Green paper (put on a show) hey (get on the flo')
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper (c'mon)
Green paper

[Outro: Timbaland] + (Justin)
In all, in thrilling, new, living, sound
In all, in thrilling, new, living, sound (break it down)
In all, in thrilling, new, living, sound
(She wanna break it down for me, for me, break it down, break it down)
In all, in thrilling, new, living, sound
In all, in thrilling, new, living, sound (break it down)
In all, in thrilling, new, living, sound (break it down)
In all, in thrilling, new, living, sound
