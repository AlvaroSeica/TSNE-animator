"Ooooh. They're half alien you know!"

Yes, nobody paid attention to me
as a midget obsidian in the Carribean
I was the last frog to leap because Tull Buhren
gave me an impetious sword I use epsom salt on frogskin
It hurt, I didn't know that all the talents I was given
at the deformitory would help me win
Now I move land sea space government gems
They wanna use me for special arts, like I'm their creation
God made me
So untouchable I'll stay
I like my life
And while you try and do whatever
It doesn't matter
A foreign globester
I'm the globester</pre>
