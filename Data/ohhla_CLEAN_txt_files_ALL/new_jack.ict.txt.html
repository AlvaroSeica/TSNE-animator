[Verse One: Ice-T]
Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long
Grit my teeth, spray 'til every nigga is gone
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots
Last thing I sweat is a sucker punk cop
Move like a king when I roll hops
You try to flex, BANG! another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out
Why? - Cash money ain't never gonna play out
I got nothing to lose, much to gain
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight, you're motherfucking right
Think of my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight
So many whores on my jock, think I'm a movie star
In nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car
Go to school, I ain't going for it
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moët
Cause I don't wanna hear that crap
Why? - I'd rather be a New Jack Hustler!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Hustler, hustler, hustler
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler

[Monologue: Kid]
Yo man, you know what I'm saying?
You got it going on my man, I like how it's going down
You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels
Look at that ring right there, I know it's real, it's gotta be real
Man, you're the fliest nigga I've seen in my life!
Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man, how can I be down?

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
What's up? - You say you wanna be down?
Ease back, or motherfucker get beat down
Out my face, fool, I'm the illest
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis
Got my crew in effect, that I bought them new Jags
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags
All I think about is keys and Gs
Imagine that, me working in Mickey Ds (ha ha ha ha)
That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke
When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke
You don't like my lifestyle? - Fuck you!
I'm rolling with the New Jack crew 
And I'm a hustler, H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler

[Hook: DJ Aladdin Scratching and cutting]
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack, New Jack.. hustler ---&gt; Ice-T
New, New, New, New, New, New, New Jack.. hustler ---&gt; Ice-T
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack, New Jack.. hustler ---&gt; Ice-T
New, New, New, New, New, New, New Jack.. hustler ---&gt; Ice-T
New Jack, New Jack, New Jack, New Jack.. hustler ---&gt; Ice-T
New, New, New, New, New, New, New Jack.. hustler ---&gt; Ice-T

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Here I come, so you better break North
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothing about you, and that's evident
All I love is my dope and Dead Presidents
Sound crazy? - Well, it isn't
The ends justifies the means, that's the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets, checked the grip, and now I got clout
I had nothing, and I wanted it
You had everything, and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine, my success came speedy
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get, another brother drops
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand
God damn! - you got me sinking in quicksand
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn
With my posse, out on the ave
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare? - Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell? - Well, shit gets hot
Pregnant teens, children's screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
You don't come here much, and you better not
Wrong move BANG! - ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got 
So what, if some motherfucker gets shot?
That's how the game is played, another brother slayed
The wound is deep BUT they're giving us a Band Aid
My education is low but I got long dough
I'm raised like a Pit Bull, my heart pumps Nitro'
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician
My Uzi is my best friend, cold as a mortician
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe
There'll be another one after me! ~ a hustler

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Hustler, H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
