[Intro: Kilo Kish]
Umm, okay
Yea, can do
Uhh, where is this song in my Blackberry?
Yea, yea
Okay cool

[Kilo Kish]
Okay, as my mind runs lickin cotton candy lipstick
You're right here in my room, yeah I wished it
Candlelight vigil for the one you're texting
Pink sweatpants - hmm, interesting
No need, don't explain to me, love
Cause I know how you deal but I could see us
in a different way, don't play me cause we're not the same
Sign on, sees your screename and misbehave
So you're a +Playboy+, you think you're Heff kid?
Hoppin 'round town with the bunnies when
I'm the candy that you need, brush your sweet tooth
Heard you got it put replaced with a statue
A Veneer, I hear she's just swell
If you wanna date a rock, you think I can't tell?
So you're bored? Are you lost? Was it worthwhile?
I feel the ice-cold chill in her warm smile
Saw you last night, you didn't have to act foul
Come and sweep me from the background
Feel my palms heat up on your chest now
As the night creeps, into bedtime vows
Married in a white t-shirt, best out
Still you know that I'm the best route
You deserve what you get
It's called respect, you ever heard of it?

[Chorus: Kilo Kish + Childish Gambino]
I know what you're missin in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right, make it go right...
I know what you're missin in your new life
I can fly away and make it go right
It go, it go
It go, it go

[Childish Gambino]
When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call
I used to front somethin stupid, now I'm makin them wait
Except for you mama, I'm ready, I don't wanna be late
Never hesitate, you know it, petty cash, we blow it
Excuse me for imperfect; them halfway looks is worth it
I watched these niggaz lurkin, they just want my leftovers
Watch 'em locked up all day and slept over
Put your-put your hair back, afro (afro)
Skippin after-parties at the last show
I'ma hold your hand in Little Tokyo
And tell you somethin in your ear that you shouldn't know
Two jumps, but the feelin was so gone
High school swag, busy fuckin with clothes on
Lost a couple words, joke around the reason
You can wear my shirt, pretend to let you win that FIFA
There was nothin like it, settle down
You always hit me when my boo around
It's a long walk, we ain't talkin though
That ratchet hoe on lock-n-load, I appreciate the offer though
I'ma do it right, but later though
Cause either way you're gonna hate me like you say you won't
Thank God for that
It's called regret, you ever heard of it?

[Chorus] - 2X
