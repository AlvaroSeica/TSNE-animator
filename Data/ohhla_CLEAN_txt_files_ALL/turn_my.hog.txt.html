(Hook)
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Tinted up, he-hear me in it
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Turn my knock up, turn my-turn my knock up
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Tinted up, he-hear me in it
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Turn my knock up, turn my-turn my knock up
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it

(Verse 1)
My seats alligator, everything tailored
And you know my trunk is beatin like drum major
Open it up and it reads "Fuck a hater"
Come through knockin magnets off your refrigerator, nigga
And I know these niggas despise (Fuck 'em all)
But they can hear me now, like Verizon
Behind tint like the president, that's how I'm ridin
And my paint is wetter than a broken fire hydrant
And I'ma have a million bucks any minute
But for now my pockets full of bread, it's plenty in it
Up under my hood, it's a Hemi in it
On my lap, it's a fully loaded semi in it

(Hook)
Tinted up, he-hear me in it
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Turn my knock up, turn my-turn my knock up
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Tinted up, he-hear me in it
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Turn my knock up, turn my-turn my knock up
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it

(Verse 2, Slim Thug)
Slim Thugga mothafuckaaaa
Turn my knock up, you can hear me 'fo ya see meee
Beatin the block up, they lookin like they watchin TV
Trunk popped up, old school lookin new
That Hogg line got the whole street lookin blue
Bops lookin too, flaggin like we at a cab
Fo's dancin shootin stars when I hit the ave.
Tinted up, you can't see me but I'm seein you
Eyes starin hard, but you still ain't seein through
They like, who is that pullin on my corner creepin
With the trunk beatin, while my baby sleepin
Wake that mothafucka up and tell 'em Thugga comin
I'm addicted to the shit, I ain't stop stuntin

(Hook)
Tinted up, he-hear me in it
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Turn my knock up, turn my-turn my knock up
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Tinted up, he-hear me in it
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Turn my knock up, turn my-turn my knock up
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it

(Verse 3)
I'm a country ass nigga, doin country ass shit
In my country ass car, with my country ass bitch
I let the top drop, and let the trunk knock
Everybody ridin fo's so I brought the blades out
Got the wood in the dash and the motherfuckin wheel
When you see a pimp shine, bitch tell me how ya feel
You niggas know the drill when I pull up in the lot
Better get them hand cuffs, cause you know she gon' bop
I'm sippin and smokin, if I'm in it, it's tinted
And you bitch niggas fakin, so if you in it, it's rented
How I'm livin is splendid, and how I'm rollin is golden
And the candy is purple just like the shit that we blowin

(Hook)
Tinted up, he-hear me in it
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Turn my knock up, turn my-turn my knock up
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Tinted up, he-hear me in it
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it
Turn my knock up, turn my-turn my knock up
Turn my knock up, bet them niggas hear me in it</pre>
