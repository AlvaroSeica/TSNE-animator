if you got people out livin' in the street, that's real
if you gotta do dirt just to eat, that's real
if you got family behind bars, that's real
all you got to hold on to is your scars, that's real
strugglin every day to beat the odds, that's real
if the only one you trust is god, that's real
never had shit so you try to build, that's real
if you've been through it fuck how they feel, that's real

if it isn't love, then its fear and I can smell it
step into a room and inhale it
first I go through it then tell it, give credit
mix it down, wrap it up and then sell it
you can get it, angelic, hell raised
standing it in, ignorance is embedded
but I won't let it
touch souls, mind of muscle
history repeats, don't rewind the struggle
imagine if the bus up north was amistad
they understand pain but don't understand ours
I work hard, if you call this a job
more than a man, less than a god
these eyes have seen things you wouldn't believe of
these feet have walked past some only you've dreamed of
and now that I'm aware of what I'm capable of
I stand on the edge of the stage and spread love
just breathe
if you had enough, about to give up
just breathe
if your hands on the gun about to bust
just breathe
now you know the lord is looking down on us
just breathe
in due time, aint no need to rush
just breathe
stay strong, things will get better
just breathe
if you had enough, about to give up
just breathe
if your hands on the gun about to bust
just breathe
now you know the lord is looking down on us, just

sometimes life's ill, sometimes I pop pills
pacing around in circles, I know how it feels
to wake up in the morning and to want a mill drinking sugar water
just to keep the stomach chill but here and there you swear theres days you cant take it
and you came to the conclusion that today you wont make
and run a bubble bath naked drinking hennesee you test god with your suicide tendecies
slice a line in your wrist for every bad memory
tears will drip from there cheek when they remember me
I clutch a suicide note tight in my fist looking at the ceiling
wondering how did it come to this
the tub is filmed to the rim in my own blood
hoping someone comes to save me all I need is love
angels pick me up and clothes up my cuts and whispered in my ear you cant give up justÂ…

if you had enough, about to give up
just breathe
if your hands on the gun about to bust
just breathe
now you know the lord is looking down on us
just breathe
and through time, aint no need to rush
just breathe
stay strong, things will get better
just breathe
if you had enough, about to give up
just breathe
if your hands on the gun about to bust
just breathe
NOW YOU KNOW THE LORD IS LOOKING DOWN ON US, JUST...</pre>
