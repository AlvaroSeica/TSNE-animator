[Verse 1 - Lil' Pete]
'Cuz I'm the menace of the cliq and I'm dumpin' don't get up on me
Talkin' bout killin' people, ain't nobody 'fin to harm me
You know my army, D.S.G.B. we 'bout that cheese
Strictly 'bout paper, we get our bread and then we leave
We sucka-free, we don't play 'round with boys
And if we ridin', besta believe we got that toys (Clap)
Them Georgia Boys, and Georgia Girls, don't play
So best believe, we represent, G.A

BLACKEYE!, I'm the fire you couldn't put out
I'm that tire that didn't blow, and ain't nobody gon' take us out
We realer than real, you faker and then fake
Harder than Chevy stands in my way

P.T.
Now it's enough for all my dealers and my 'cuz
All my folks, everybody showin' love
I'm sittin' on dubs, up on the southside
I'm representin' D.S.G.B., let's ride
My fifteens beatin down Ralph Abernathy
I'm bumpin' "I'm Bad", from Pittsburgh out in happy
Ain't no lil boys, don't want to see us
From ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
I'm representin'
