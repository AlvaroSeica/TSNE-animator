[Slaine]
The Devil here he comes, lurkin in the drums
Workin with the moves he keeps a serpent with his tongue
Snake up in the grass who's as merciless as him
I am of none, nobody else, no one
Percocets and rum, circle him and run
The lion's out his cage and the circus isn't done
It's only just begun, I'm in a dark place
There's somethin in my blood that's makin my heart race
... I think I'm goin crazy
Keep thinkin people wanna grave me, body me
Probably mean, this insanity is gonna swallow me
Forget it you don't understand man you don't follow me
Some people wanna see me dead
That's why I keep a .45 under my bed
There's no sun, just rain and thunder instead
Look what this sick world has to done to my head!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Do you see what I see when you go to sleep?
Devils in your head, angels underneath the sheets
Voices of apocalypse are tangled in your speech
THERE'S A WAR~! Ain't nobody anglin for peace

[Slaine]
The burgundy'll calm me, murdered by your mommy
Five hundred for the suction up in her dirty punani
Whole world lost their way, 30 tsunamis
Buildings knocked from the force of 32 armies
Apocalypse is comin, rocket ships are hummin
Gangster motherfuckers who are poppin clips and gunnin
Crackheads rollin on you get your pocketbooks and run 'em
So are we to believe that this Jesus is comin?
The people want religion, their religion's money
It isn't funny, liquor got me sick to my tummy
Dunny, look around, don't be a dummy
Probably never see it if you don't see it from me
If some bleed we all bleed - this curse isn't right
because it's bad every day but it's worse in the night
It's why I stay high and I curse into mics
Cause death is the only thing certain in life

[Chorus]
