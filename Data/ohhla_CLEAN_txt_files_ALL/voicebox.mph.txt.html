[Hook]
What you gonna do when you lose your voice?
Not a word gets heard and you can't make a noise
Scream at the top of your lungs
When what you've got becomes numb and undone
Now it's - a loose fit, and you lose spit
Trying to figure out how to do this

[Verse 1]
I was fifteen, caught in a slipstream
at that point finally focused on my big dream
But it seemed like it might be a little too late
Felt a cold rush, chill in the guts, blue in the face
Too cold to scream, had to leave it with fate
Whole lot on my mind but not a word to say
Would you hold these scenes? Replay 'em to my mates
It was the summer of '94, everything in shape
Had the sunscreen on to avoid the burning rays
These were the days to further make me a man
About 300 metres from where we'd set up camp
You could hear the flow of the river, as it ran
A holiday retreat with me and my fam
The way life is - didn't go according to plan
Had been swimming on my own, legs started to cramp
I began to feel heavy, barely keeping my head - above order
Panic set in as I tried to tread water
As all the water started to fill up my lungs
I was sure that it was all done
I'd lost my voice, body becoming numb
Stunned at the possible outcome, couldn't even call for help
And I recall at that moment, asking myself...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Then the panic slowly died down
At ease with turning the lights out
Heaven or hell? Guessing I was gonna find out
Tensed up muscles began to wind down
Devil probably thinking, "Huh, you're all mine now"
Drifting downstream, rapids almost wiped out
Tied down by the impressive flow of H2O
Undertow had a firm grip on my ankles
Pulling me down, liquid wrapped, tightly strangled
Gasp for that last breath, let it go, accept it
When all you can do is welcome that death sentence
Defenceless against this power of nature
The same thing that makes ya can break ya down to a fraction
And that's the last thing I remember that happened
Everything went black and then I passed out... huh
When I woke, no pearly gates, just a smiling face
Revived to take the reminder of a violent shake
She risked her life to save that of a stranger
Feet first into the danger and gave her favour
Huh, which I could never repay
She played the saviour, and then she walked away
And I didn't even get a chance to say...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You see, that day - still sends shivers
That day - still drowns this liver of mine
Still a little afraid to close these eyes
And I can't help but visualise that river
That picture that infiltrates my nights
That minute I almost lost my life
That distance I could never gain despite how hard I've tried
Pulled the plug, but must of put up a hell of a fight
Revived, I was given back my breath
Which I still use to inhale these cigarettes
Abusive but we do this in effect
Connect chain reaction, addictive in many ways
We crave our passions, defined by our outlets
No matter what happens, can't dampen that call of the wild
Unless there's a wet blanket amongst all the smiles
While we speak free, taking for granted each week
Weakness lurks, before long we're knee deep in these seas
No idea who the fuck we be, just them, they, us, you, me
And when they take our voice we lose that sleep</pre>
