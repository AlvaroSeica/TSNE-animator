[Struggle Da Preacher] (talking)
I cry not due to hard life
But due to my sensitive heart

[Chorus: Asya Solovyova]
I kiss away all your tears
I am yours
You fly away overseas
For so long

[Verse 1: Struggle Da Preacher]
What are my tears for you? Salty drops of water?
Remember when they hit ya skin when I hold ya
Scauldin' tears heat so badly
Fire wounds from them are so deadly on our hearts
Everytime I see you its like last time
I value every minute holdin' ya arms
Those deep scars in my heart keep bleedin
You can't stop the flow of blood and bloody tears
I'ma seriously mad, I'ma damn upset
I can't take the rules of our blue planet
People changed the rules, people wanna die
Their tears are dead another way of guile
In pictures I never smile
My soul keep cryin' livin' in this world
Only you make me happy
But also only you who were able to trap me

[Chorus]

[Struggle Da Preacher] (talking)
I really appreciate your support
It means alot to me, I never take it for granted

[Verse 2: Struggle Da Preacher]
Never say good bye to you
say good bye to yesterday
By the way I live by the memories of the past days
When we were together, when we were like one
And nothin could change it, only you and i
Now I cry, don't try to calm me
Here is the defenition of my teardroppin
It's the speech of my soul, every tear is a word
Every tear is a statement about the love that I hold
I thought i'd never love this way
When I saw my father cryin' when mom went away
There are many women besides her
But only now I know what is to love just one girl
Yeah I never played one but was lookin' for one
And once I found one there is some shit which put me down
I'm cryin so what?
You think I am weak? Try to hold what I hold

[Chorus]

[Struggle Da Preacher] (talking)
You know, we are always for each other
You know I'm always down with you
never gonna leave you, so
You not gonna worry about anything, so
I'm always here for you as you there for me

[Chorus]

[Struggle Da Preacher] (talking)
Once again I'm still there with you
No matter how far I am</pre>
