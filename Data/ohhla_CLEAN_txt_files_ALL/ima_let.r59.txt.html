Song:   I'ma Let You Tell It
Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
But I'ma let you tell it (Smash Squad)
And you can ask me who's the illest around (Statik)
But I'ma let you tell it
Yeah, I can probably tell you my opinion on that
But I'ma let you tell it (You show off)
Don't ask me, "Who the illest MC?"
I'ma let you tell it

[Verse One]
It ain't rocket science
I know you ain't cock no iron
I know who you run behind if them shots was flyin'
I know who the crime, the crook, the lolly gag sets
The rhymes, the book, the hookers who probably have sex
The kinds, the shook ones, the pawns the rook
And how the lines would look if I'm hooked to a polygraph test
Call me papi, the best
The answer to the solution to the problem in hip hop
You copy the test
I'm the cockiest catch
You a throw
You the treat at the end of my hook
You the eaten
You a hoe
You seem to be about losin'
There seem to be parts of my style 
Lingerin' in your bowel movement
I took the courage and built my
Own company
I own somethin' that's why I purchased the silk tie
This is words to live by
Watch your words
Cause words trigger the trigger herbs get killed by
Shut up it's two shooters
Bet I can give you a tip
Get a new whip
And set up a new jeweler
Get wet up this 2-2-1
Light up your head and exit your lip
And sweat up your suit coolers
All your teams involved in things
That enter in your body and end all your dreams
Enter in your shoulder
Exit out your ass
Hittin' every organ like a pinball machine

[Chorus]</pre>
