[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner, who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me.. Lord forgive me, things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone...
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music , I would share it but today I'm yellin
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my VIBE, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich, hol' up
Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks  but now my album platinum and shit? So what
Y'all keep the numbers , I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
This courtesy of Compton (courtesy of Compton); Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the east like I'm Chuck D, dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin to be the God MC, you look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there - I'm fuckin this industry hard
I'm baggin this money, tea-baggin your honey, you'd thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're lightweight, they tell me you nice and I'm like, "wait...
Go get me a knife, you're lookin like steak" and when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And where the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher but we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase, I know you heard me nigga, this is a burpee nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now homie, I'm in extra vibe
Pipe down on the curve when you heard that I got these words to the upper echelon, that's excell-ant

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Up in the clouds, me and my spouse...
Rumors on the ground gettin too loud, please turn them shits down (down, DOWN...)
Can't hear myself think.. turbulence, shit, I almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink, runnin through that bitch like it's my house, all up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is BALL, no, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to 
empty my, mem-ory, bank, it's a +Million Dollars+ in it, +Baby+, Hilary Swank
Sittin next to Hilary smellin like dank, presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll WAIT... {*echoes*} ...
I've been in my wave like twenty years straight, I've been on my vibe like twenty years straight
Don't fuck up my high~! (Fuck up my high~!) Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
And still be skraight (still be skraight), fall back bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath... I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint... {*inhales*}, smokin this shit like I'm tryna prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno, kill my, vibe, that's your motherfuckin funeral {*laughs*}

[Kendrick Lamar]
...Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggaz pissed off..
I'm in this lil' 'dition shit, envision my fort
Leader of the new school, on my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be +Black Swan+?
World in my palms, ironically, I am the Globetrotters' best cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggaz when I was 16 that I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with 16, should have been in the pen but now my pen writing with morphine
I heal niggaz, touch down with more fiends, I kill niggaz, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was runnin for dear life but now I'm runnin the map, bitch, I'm here NIGGA~!
Picture little old me givin a fuck from what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or hit a Suburban, nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent but I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like BLAP! Mini-14 like BLAP! Empty out another magazine like BLAP!
Hit a young nigga, get BACK! (DOO!), I kill 'em all when they try to kill my VIBE! (DOO! DOO!)
I am the bad, the good guy, the last the hood got, the last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a ten second drum solo, bitch see you at Woodstock, AH!</pre>
