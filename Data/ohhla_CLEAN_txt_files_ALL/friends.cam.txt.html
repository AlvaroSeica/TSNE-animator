Park your Honda in WalMart parking lot in front of the store 
Jump in wit me hit the highway to the room we go
Oh no I need to get a box of rubbers
so I can get the throat then jump in the covers
Shower up and drop you off so you can get wit yo lover
Call me up later baby girl when your ready to fuck a-gain
Hit the weed smash off in the wind
Hey lil momma lets play

[Chorus]

[Camoflauge]
Baby girl can we kick it, I'm sorry if I'm too explicit
Visions of you with out no clothes on got me dizzy
I like yo size, the look in yo eyes
that thing between yo thighs, can I push inside?
Do you wanna roll wit me, hit a optimo wit me
Freak from the bed to the floor wit me
but no hickies, fuck yo man you wit a player tonight
we gon pop a couple of bottles just to make shit right
and after that I'ma try to break ya back, hit ya from the back
Make you feel it in your stomach ask you how you love that
Me and you ducked off,  gettin our nuts off
Cut off your cellular phone girl lets get lost

[Chorus] - repeat 8X
