[Intro: Congress Alley's "God Save America"]
All the signs of a dying nation, God save America
Just look arooooound and lead the traces
God, saves America

(ALC, chill out man, f'real)

[Evidence]
I set it off in the sunny distance, no days existin
My patience let me wait 'til the greatest love listened to me
I used to play the witness, wait in the trenches
It's like the sixth man sits on different benches
It's hard squeezin life in a sentence
And if I do, roll carpet with the red tint
My entrance and what's between
When I exit, it's +Evidence+ left on the scene
Alchemist cut the record down, to the bone
and with a record like this I take the world by storm (..by force!)
It's God bless the land of the brave
Understand where I stand, my hand is made
From B-R-double-O-K-lyn, +The Planet+
Family landed, managed to raise the man that I became
Panic on my first campaign
But when the words fell in place, I was certain to reign/rain
I lit the purple, then step in the circle and start flexin
(The Weatherman invented) Now storms change directions
Portions of my proceeds is feedin my homies now
I always shared pretty good for an only child
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong
Now the role's reversed, I'm puttin people on
They on welfare, you got healthcare
and used to have their priorities elsewhere (It's funny)
I took rims and tires and traded them
For a ticket to an island, that's where I wrote this rhyming
Where I first saw my vision written
Briven by a better living, a place to raise kids in
So I think like I rule the world
On the brink of something bigger, buildin schools for boys and girls
The thought alone gets me out of my bed
I said, "You got them tools, get them shits up out of the shed" 
C'mon~!
