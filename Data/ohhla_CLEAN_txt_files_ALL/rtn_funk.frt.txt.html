Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro: Mike Shinoda] + (DJ Green Lantern)
(C'mon!) Ha ha (what up Mike?)
How's this for a fuckin remix right? (You got it)
Yeah (Fort Minor) You ready? Okay
Ladies and gentlemen
For those of you that wanna know what we're really all about
Still like this (c'mon!)

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

[DJ Green Lantern]
This is the remix!

[Mike Shinoda]
Mike - he doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's all about reality and makin some noise
Makin the story, makin sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin it up - let's go!

[Tak]
Who the hell is he anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin 'em star struck
Humble through opportunities given despite the fact
that many misjudge him cause he makes a livin from writin raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never askin for someone's help, or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an ar-tist

[Ryu]
This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the West in flames?
And I heard him wreckin with The Crystal Method, "Name of the Game"
Came back, dropped "Megadef," took 'em to church
I like "Bleach" man, Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth, now everybody givin him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fuckin with S-dot

[Chorus]

[Ryu]
They call him Ryu he's sick, and he's spittin fire and Mike
got him out the dryer he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fuckin 'nihilist porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women wanna be with, and rappers hope he gets shot
Eight years in the makin, patiently waitin to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

[Tak]
Tak - he's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got, makin his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep askin him
was it, given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?
No, he's livin proof, got him rockin the booth
He'll get you buzzin quicker than a shot of vodka with juice (juice)
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

[Mike Shinoda]
Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why
he works so hard, it seems like he's never got time
Because he, writes every note, and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key, or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even tryin - how do they do it?

[Chorus] Â– 2X

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, Mike Shinoda, Fort Minor
