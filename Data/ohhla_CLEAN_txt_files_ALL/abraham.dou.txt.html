Song:   Seeds of Abraham
Typed by: alcatrazz_iz_crazy_4_god@yahoo.com

[Chorus]
all the seeds of Abraham stepping into the jam
pump your fist and enlist with the Great I Am
we came to rock these hands up high and defy
some gravity we casually infiltrating your high fi
seeds of Abraham up in the jam
pump your fist like you can't resist the program
while we rock these hands up high and defy
some gravity we casually infiltrating your high fi

[Verse 1]
we infiltrating casually causing some casualty it had to be
a principality trying to battle me it rattled me not
I got too much soul plus control of this
Mic device I'm leaving sliced from the Spirit within
That sin ain't never crossed it lost back in the day
While it's testing I'm blessing the word play
Stay tight like lasso Pablo Picasso
Bringing art thru a poem canvas metronome
My home page is locked up in a spiral
I rival with words of enemies from Most High
We try to lock up destiny on top of this microphone
Waiting till the day my crew blows up like firestone
On an SUV cause when I bless you'll be
Inside a state of shock cause how I rock the SMPTE
With tones for time codes and modes on full force
I'm living narrowly righteousness the course

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They wanted truth dropped in the booth they wanted proof
That the resurrected risen Son is busy giving one, two, threes
When I'm checking degrees my mic burn
It was red hot after it got to my turn
Watch the world turn never concerned with what it offer me
Watch it confound the wise so they could scoff at me
Their righteousness for self tells me they're wack
Plus they jack four minutes I ain't never getting back
Yet the fact remains I'm busy smacking names
And taking aim at a market that's black, jargon attack
The white sheets I fight beats bare knuckling chuckling
At all it's weakness, speak this poem
So heads could freely roam like a cellular phone I've known
Many a man doing wrong in a song so the gong rings
Sings vibrato in staccato, till exit stage left is their unofficial motto

[Chorus]</pre>
