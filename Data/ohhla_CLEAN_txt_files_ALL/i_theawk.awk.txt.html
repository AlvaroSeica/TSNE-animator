[Intro: DJ Dyllemma cuts]
You know I'm really trying not to be a pessimist
AWKWORD
But on the other hand, but on the other hand
I cram to understand your plan

[AWKWORD]
I hate the fake friends, back stabbing rats
I love the innocence of youth, getting lost in that
I hate to be bothered, when I'm walking down the street
I love, all my people who need a dollar to eat
I hate the lack of action, upstate in the country
I love going back, where everybody loves me
I hate the blame game, dating game and breakups
I love this Jewish chick, she don't need to use makeup
I hate bad puns and poor choices a words
I love the language, creativity's encouraged
I hate the rudeness, I ain't here to hold your door
I love a sense of humor, like laughing 'til I'm sore
I hate ALL drugs, they ruin your life
I love the way drugs feel, REALLY nice
I hate music politricks, the artist will lose
I love making music, mind and body will move

[Chorus: DJ Dyllemma cuts]
You know I'm really trying not to be a pessimist
AWKWORD
But on the other hand
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake

You know I'm really trying not to be a pessimist
AWKWORD
But on the other hand, but on the other hand
I cram to understand your plan

[AWKWORD]
I got heart burn, from the burgers and shakes
I got chapped lips, plus I got the shakes
I got halitosis from the cigarette breaks
I got addicted to caffeine, cause im always awake
I got a problem with women, ain't as good as my mommy
I got a problem with men, ain't nada but zombies
I got a problem with pigs, if they cool, anomaly
I got a problem with authority, tryna calm me
I got tossed in jail, for smoking the peace plant
I got a high five, choking kid under street lamp
I got no love, when I dropped the LP
I got no worries, no doc can help me
I got a bad back, heavy weight on my shoulder
I got a drug problem, I hate being sober
I got a hard head, your boy's trying to get over
I got big plans, I guess I'll do it when I'm older

[Chorus]

[AWKWORD]
I am a tough guy, it didn't happen by choice
I am prone to cry, hear the hurt in my voice
I'm honest and open, expect a lot from my boys
I am outspoken, got no time for you toys
I'm a sociologist, try to test my knowledge
I'm also a writer, plus, iller after college
I'm kind of a comedian, sucker for laughter
I am revolutionary, call me conscious rapper
I'm sick of sickness, death and mourning
I'm here cause my dad chilled with me in the morning
I'm sick of the president, sick of the job loss
I'm sick of corporations, they don't care about our thoughts
I'm all for feedback, appreciate the criticism
I'm also a fan, so I respect the cynicism
I'm not immune to hate, please think before you type
I am just a human being, and I will get trife

[Outro: DJ Dyllemma cuts]
You know I'm really trying not to be a pessimist
AWKWORD
But on the other hand
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake

You know I'm really trying not to be a pessimist
AWKWORD AWKWORD AWKWORD...
