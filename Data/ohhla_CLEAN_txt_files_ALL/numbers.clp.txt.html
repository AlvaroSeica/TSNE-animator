[Intro]
(Yeaaah!) How you feelin?
(Fiiiine!) Feel alright?!

[Pusha T]
I'm so bossy, bitch get off me ("YEAAAAH!")
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
("Y'all feel like that??") Your SL's missin an S, nigga
("Y'all feel like that??") Your plane's missing a chef
The common theme see they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound ("YEAAAAH!")
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come a hundred goin overboard ("YEAAAAH!")
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn
Ballers! I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin or I'm rappin to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin up this raw
("Y'all feel like that??") Givenchy fittin like it's gym clothes
We really gym stars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-league, I'm like these clothes
'88 Jordan, leapin from the free throw ("YEAAAAH!")

Ballers! I put numbers on the boards
Ballers! I put numbers on the boards

("Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more"
