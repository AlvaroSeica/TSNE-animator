[Hook: Hell Razah]
Money make the world go round, and round in circles, now
My love is virtue, my guns'll all wanna hurt you, now
People make the world go round, and round in circles, no
My love is virtue, my guns'll all wanna hurt you, now

[Hell Razah]
Any song that I sing you, is only for the real to relate to
My unemployed Section 8 crew, I know it's painful
Mommy gotta do what she do, because the rents due
My sister's gave birth to my first niece and nephews
Cash Rules the ghetto, goodbye for hellos
Project six levels, of black rebels
'88 crack settle, on blood vessel, shit
From dropouts, that was the only rescue
We got rich off the streets, son was buried beneath
Cuz the block had stocks and bonds like Wallstreet
Kilos were sold to the highest bidder, now we got suppliers with us
Bringing more dough, so we can higher killers
The only superhero was the coke dealer
You know the diamonds in the watch and the sunroof top
Batcave was the crackspot, got raided alot
Cop stories had shorties, too afraid to be locked

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
It's time to bring that hood love, back together
We caught it bad from the crack era, had to bury a few
Fill the graves with the evil that men do
Or behind jail bars in a federal pen suit
No V.I.'s or letters, no calls can get through
Feel the pain of the heart of the youth
You wanna go and conquer the truth
Feeling like Bishop in Juice, I'm feeling like Marvin Gaye in his booth

[Hell Razah]
My grandma 77, told me Hell we heading
So she had conversations with Heaven
Granddaddy still love his caddy and how the young girls keep him happy
Even though he married, he nasty
But he fight to keep his family tight, make sure they morgage is paid
There's food, clothes, phones and lights
Up north he got a daughter that's alone at night
She fell in love with modern day New York City life
41, working two jobs, for money to come
Got a daughter, 16, and a son, 21
Try to school 'em how the streets love to swallow the young
Tried to keep him out of beef, but he follow the gun
He got two felonies, and a baby that's one
Ain't nobody gun shots, ain't making him run
On the low, his man hitting his sister, meanwhile
She got a cat that's on Riker's Island, sending him pictures
Tattoes on her back, and she hang with strippers
Get paid, young age, on the stage with liquor
Got a crush for them Escalades, relay with killas
That's why grandma hoping that the lord forgive us
