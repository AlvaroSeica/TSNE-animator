Come on then lets fucking do it (mumbles hook)

Well you see my brains out of order and I think I'm out of order
And I think I got to order a bran new mind mind
mines out of order what the fuck is wrong with you?
Well Werd mate I think your out your god damn mind
Well my brains out of order and I think I'm out of order
And I think I got to order a bran new mind mind
mines out of order what the fuck is wrong with you?
Well Werd mate your out your fucking god damn mind

Im in the padded room mate and Joey's up the corridor
And me and Dylan sitting spitting ripping on harmonicas
And that fucking nurse got me burst she gone follow ya
Until you take them all and you fall yeah I'm warning ya
I'm warning ya I get fucking tight cause I'm a foreigner
I have to go and order a flat in fucking Florida
So we can all be friends like Ross Rach and Monica
And al be as fake as Rick Ross the officer
Hey I'm pure bossing ya I'm managing man
Look at your band man their hardly managing man
You got nothing on me this nothing to me
I wrote this while nutting I am fucking the beat
They had me slumped in seat putting volts in teeth
With these wee wire pads pure stuck to my cheeks
And I don't mean on my face mean my fucking ass cheeks
Next time I drop shit they can study my speech

Ah my brains out of order and I think I'm out of order
And I think I got to order a bran new mind mind
mines out of order what the fuck is wrong with you?
Well Werd mate I think your out your god damn mind
Well my brains out of order and I think I'm out of order
And I think I got to order a bran new mind mind
mines out of order what the fuck is wrong with you?
Well Werd mate your out your fucking god damn mind

Yeah I flow like rah get around like your ma
I keep going like rah you'll be going like ahhh
You got nothing on ah I keep going going rah
And thats not a word that is Werd going rah
Ha ha ha what the fuck is looking at?
I leave a cunt smashed see that guy I'm hooking that
But wait thats a mirror and the guy keeps hooking back
And hitting on my hand so I laugh and hook him back
Now I've cracked and I'm falling to pieces
Picking up wee bits of the glass and thats creepy
Thinking that your picking up wee bits of yourself
Trying to pull yourself together but your looking like hell
Now I've found all the bits laid them out in the corner
Yeah all the bits except a chip on my shoulder
Looking at me looking at me looking like me
And getting out here's not likely

See my brains out of order and I think I'm out of order
And I think I got to order a bran new mind mind
mines out of order what the fuck is wrong with you?
Come on kids lets sing it just one more time
Well my brains out of order and I think I'm out of order
And I think I got to order a bran new mind mind
mines out of order what the fuck is wrong with you?
Well Werd mate your out your fucking god damn mind

Like mine mine mind thats the noise of hitting padded walls
Running round in circles thinking your a fucking cara-sol
cara-sel caramel maybe its a casserole?
This shit is pasta joke and I dont like this crappy home
This crappy home am crapping on as a just sit and rap alone
And looking at the mirror I disfigured not that long ago
I figger I've not long to go I longer for a longer show
No longer will you stop my flow so come along and here we go

Brains out of order and I think I'm out of order
And I think I got to order a bran new mind mind
mines out of order what the fuck is wrong with you?
Come on kids this is really the last time
Well my brains out of order and I think I'm out of order
And I think I got to order a bran new mind mind
mines out of order what the fuck is wrong with you?
Well Werd mate your out your fucking god damn mind</pre>
