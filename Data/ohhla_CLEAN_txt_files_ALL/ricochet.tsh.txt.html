[Tash]
Mm.. sing that shit for daddy baby
Pump this motherfucker up.. richochet, ricochet
RICHOCHET (ricochet, ricochet)
RICHOCHET (yo homies, one two yo)

Mmm..
My style is too cold for words, it's like a bullet gone stray
Ease off, I'm bout to speak and hit the wall and ricochet
I rock the Cali way (for sure) I'm only in it to score
Niggaz say I'm owed one, but it's more like four
Hardcore entrepeneur, strainin like a champ
Rollin out in sixty-three's, that hop without a ramp
Young Tash Vamp'll kick your door in while you're snorin;
now where's that salt you was pourin?
I send the bullet soarin, yo ayy, let you slide?  No way
If you a -- "Why do niggaz shoot?" -- ("Alright, okay" - Mos Def)
I gotta buck you down for that shit you was poppin
Now look how rotten the whole situation's gotten
Tash showed you love you shoulda showed me some back
If they catch me they gon' stretch me like Geronimo Pratt
Cause I gotta lay you flat no matter what you say
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

	Richochet..
"Called the cops, said they heard mad shots" -&gt; Notorious B.I.G.
	"Take that motherfuckers!" -&gt; Ice Cube
	Richochet, ricochet..
	Ricochet..
.. "Called the cops, said they heard mad shots" -&gt; Notorious B.I.G.
	"Take that motherfuckers!" -&gt; Ice Cube
"Neighbors called the cops, said they heard mad shots" -&gt; B.I.G.
	"Take that motherfuckers!" -&gt; Ice Cube

[Tash]
I tried to warn you killer, my rap style'll have you sprung
like a girl gave you head with a earring in her tongue
Since Tash come from less than zero, my splurgin's urgent
My mouth so foul, you couldn't wash it with detergent
My Likwit niggaz swervin, mergin, like a rally
Rearrangin niggaz grills like the '99 Denali
	Where the fuck we at Cali?  --  You motherfuckin right!
I wanna see some action, burn somethin or fight
cause see it's Tash night tonight, it's Tash night tomorrow
I'm lookin for the hoes that got some sex I could borrow
I'll gladly pay you back next Wednesday the 3rd
(Why you laughin at me baby?)  That's my motherfuckin word
(word word word) Then it's words for nerds
Tryin to rap as fly as Tash is totally absurd
So everybody duck or catch the A.K. spray
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

	Richochet..
"Called the cops, said they heard mad shots" -&gt; Notorious B.I.G.
	"Take that motherfuckers!" -&gt; Ice Cube
	Ricochet..
	Ricochet..
"Called the cops, said they heard mad shots" -&gt; Notorious B.I.G.
	"Take that motherfuckers!" -&gt; Ice Cube
	".. mad sha-sha-shots"

Newsflash on the screen, what the fuck does this mean?
It say, "Tash is takin over the world, behind the scenes
Just drinkin beers spacin, Likwit sweeps the nation
But leave that man alone, cause you know his reptuation"
Brutalize the wicked world, I pump one verse of curse
to beat you down, beat you up, then take your girl or vice versa
You rap too commercial, you just cheat to compete
I done paid a gang of dues, I even kept the receipts
So you owe me homey, these corny niggaz outsold me
So write that blank check to Tash, the one and only
The only man standin when it's time for gunplay
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

	Richochet..
"Called the cops, said they heard mad shots" -&gt; Notorious B.I.G.

[Tash]	Ahh it's too late to duck nigga

	(Ricochet, ricochet) mmmm

	"Take that motherfuckers!" -&gt; Ice Cube

[Tash]	Aiy while I'm in this motherfucker
	let me give a extra drunken monkey shoutout to my peoples
	Yaknahmsayin all my peoples from Cypress Hill
	DMX, Big Pun, Terror Squad...
