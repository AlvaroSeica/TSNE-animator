[Intro: Akon]
Hold up, wait a minute, let me put some kush up in it! {*4X*}

[Dr. Dre]
Yeah, yeah
Now it's that puff puff pass shit, Cheech &amp; Chong grass shit
Blunts to the head, kush pillows, no matress
Speedboat traffic, bitches automatic
Cross that line fuck around and get yo' ass kicked
We roll shit that burn slow as fuckin molasses
Probably won't pass it, smoke it 'til the last hit
Down to the ashes, Mary J a bad bitch
Andre 3000 gon' drop another classic
Go ahead ask them, bitches 'bout how I be smokin out
I party all night! Oh yeah it's goin down
Quarter rounds we smoke a quarter pound of that good stuff
Oh yeah we smokin all night! Yeah puff puff
Pass that shit right here nigga, better than my last batch
Caramel concoction and a ass smack
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale

[Chorus: Akon]
Whoa~! I know you tryin to get high
Type of shit to have you leanin sideways
Whoa~! Take a whiff of this suicide
Holla at your cuz, I got it all day
No need to fly to Jamaica
for the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want the bomb bomb diggy
Holla at my niggy, he's right here in L.A.
L.A., L.A., L.A., L.A.!

[Sly]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some big stuff in it
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some big stuff in it

[Snoop Dogg]
Hmm, still I am
Tighter than the pants on will.i.am, back
Throwback, still I had a pound in my backpack
Next to where the Swishers at, smokin Presidential
Got some bubba I'll give you that, need it for my cataracts
Fo' hoes and I'm the pimp, in my Cadillac
You can tell 'em Cali back, matter fact, they'll know
This ain't 'dro, get a whiff of that
No it ain't no seeds in my sack, you ain't never gotta ask
Dogg what he smokin on, shit kush and my mind gone
What'chu think I'm on? Eyes low, I'm blown
High as a motherfucker, yeah ain't no question 'bout it
Niggaz say smoke me out, yeah I really doubt it
I'm Bob Marley reincarnated, so faded
So if you want it, you know your nigga homey
You can put it in a Zag or a Blunt and get blunted
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale

[Chorus]

[Sly]
Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
In house low no joke, make yo' ass choke
Hold up, wait a minute, you and go and put it back
Cause what you got your sack, boy it ain't that
Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
In house low no joke, make yo' ass choke
(Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale)</pre>
