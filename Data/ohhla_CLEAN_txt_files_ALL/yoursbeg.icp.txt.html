Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I really ain't got no wins
That's all right
I never had nothin to spin playa
That's still all right
I ain't got to many friends
That's all right
I don't know when a story begins either
You're the man tonight

Be sure you wanna do this
Cause once your down your down
Bitch you can make it through this
Ladies and gentlemen gather around
See a oddity a ramity a human fear
Stragin juggalagin and yet so real

I really ain't got no wins
That's all right
I never had nothin to spin playa
That's still all right
I ain't got to many friends
That's all right
I don't know when a story begins either
You're the man tonight

I'm walking though a battlefield
But I know my shit is tight
Looking for the bullet holes
Each one is beaming light
You gotta be real with it
Get drill with it don't let it disappear
You ain't feelin it you cant deal with it
You feel tricked? well

I really ain't got no wins
That's all right
I never had nothin to spin playa
That's still all right
I ain't got to many friends
That's all right
I don't know when a story begins either
You're the man tonight

Funny thing is some people think we give a fuck
I wouldent give a fuck if a dump truck full of pump bucks
Nope I wouldent give none
Tvidea media and radio
Only reason while I carry a gun
Were here to let you know there is a better place to go

I really ain't got no wins
That's all right
I never had nothin to spin playa
That's still all right
I ain't got to many friends
That's all right
I don't know when a story begins either
You're the man tonight
I really ain't got no wins
That's all right
I never had nothin to spin playa
That's still all right
I ain't got to many friends
That's all right
I don't know when a story begins either
You're the man tonight</pre>
