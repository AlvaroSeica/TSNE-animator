[Intro]
Ten-four supreme space cadet sir!

[Random]
Yo I crush you like {?}, you sweet talk
And whenever we spark, y'all see dark, y'know
We are the top brand, tryin to stop Ran
is like tryin to play Rockman when you got two chopped hands
Man swing it like a pendulum
Creatin a riff in the space-time contiuum, endin 'em
Look at the dice on my emblem, no sequence, us Ho Chi Minh
Mauseoleum embalmed, can't see 'em at all
If it's goin down, you hackers know that we was involved
Go 'head and {?} the bar
I don't be at the bar, I'ma even the odds
You fresh out of friends and ain't got no people to call
Say you tough, but I don't believe it all
I watch you teeter and fall, believe in "The Call"
So you smell the napalm, never been the quittin type
Never stopped grippin mics, never stopped spittin hype

[Chorus]
Ten toes down, ten rhymes, ten flows
Did ten more shows, ten beats, ten years
Did ten rappers, ten mics, ten styles
Ten ten magazines and ten websites
Ten ten albums, ten ten movies
It's a dime on the grind, catch up you're behind

[Random]
Mega Ran's back, spreadin like anthrax
And most of you can't rap, but fans they hands clap
Why's that? I don't know but I'm hopin and prayin
that maybe they just applaud cause they don't know what you sayin
Screamin loud but ain't sayin a thing
Had enough of these jokers so they wait for the king
Keep it dirty for the brother that just came from the sting
Carry bombs, somethin special 'bout the way that I swing
I disabled your equipment and took all your bling
Got that certain somethin most rappers ain't able to bring
That's skills; the fine artist speakin the truth
And makin it hot, son it's gettin deep in the booth
Yeah truly game ready, got competitors pissed
Cause I'm movin to the head of they list
Calculatin movin that's the point of the imbuin
How they bring it, 'til infinity we keep it movin
I'm ten toes in

[Chorus]

[Outro]
What? (Ran did it but can't quit it)
(Function is one never function alone)
(Most haters is mosaics)
(Took life by the horns just to grab the control)
(Function is one never function alone)
This is the redefinition of lyricsts, yeah</pre>
