The-the, the reason that I'm breathing
Seeping heat gets me cheese while I'm eating in Bad Season
Was deep in beef and was needing some beats to release in evenings
instead of me being up and bleeding with thieves and heathens with keys
and obstacles, made it possible for the flow, gotta be profitable
Yo Tech's audible, his inarguable product popped, it was plausible
God is so, good for giving me music
Lifting, getting me through when I was fixing to lose it
Dudes hit Big Scoob's shit and repping the blue tip
Fool's skipped, it was {?}, we jumped in the two-whip
Full clips for who stick the homie for true grip
My crew, thanks to music, we all living through it
Got me out of the ghetto, got me mucho dinero
in Cozumel Mexico, shorts and Jordans and a sombrero
This gift ain't given from a devil, so settle
Come and get this rebel music that's hot as a kettle, pendejo
Saved my life, paid my lights, made my wife say "bye bye"
Gave my night babes, I like prayed my mic
would never fade, forever slayed, days I write
My cheddar raise up better, phase way high-hyped
My music's one reason I always get to lay my pipe
The reason Tech Nina can comfortably say "night night"
Blessed me with original flow, so hey, why bite?
I hear, I feel, I live, listen and learn, I like

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I love music (yeah, I love)
I love music (for real)
I love music (and I need)
I love music (to feel)
I love music (go and play it)
I love music (yeah, know what I'm saying?)
I love music (my love)
I love music (know what I'm saying?)

[Oobergeek]
Automatic when I do this, manually
Daily, monthly, annually, I get a step closer to being the coolest
Acoustic got me fooling, about to lose it, ooh shit
Jump in the grind, and my homie Mike produced it - that's music partna
I'm just a poet with incredible rhythm
Words arranged will let you know he has incredible in him
I don't mean to toot my own horn, but toot-toot, ha-ha
I laugh because it's easier than do-re-mi-fa-so-la
ti-do, we know he go {?} on that C note
and he can play a C note with that B note, I'm talking truth
And I got stories that will show you that it's walking proof
A thousand miles of it and I can show you what I'm walking through
Music ain't a hobby, it's an organ of my body
that the creator provided back in January of '92
So don't you dare say good music skipped my generation
Your hating ain't nothing but motivation for these compilations, Oob'

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I love music (yeah, it feeds me)
I love music (I need)
I love music (you feel me?)
I love music (know what I'm saying?)
I love music (yeah, it's my thang)
I love music (know what I'm saying?)
I love music (and I love it)
I love music (yeah, go ahead)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Music is my life, the reason why I write
Like Edgar Allen Poe on the beat, like a parasite
You thought a parachute made my flow just fall out the sky
then you fell apart into a body part no one would buy
Nobody tried my limits cause they're afraid of heights
They ambition weak or gravity let 'em die
I let you live until a nigga compose a rhyme
then it's like a rhino in your ass every time
Time and time again I treat my pen like the pen
Bars harder than Pelican Bay and I been
serving a life sentence since the day I was ten
Nine times out of ten, you only ten songs deep
before you leap into a pool of sharks then swim
That's an analogy on the way I do casualties
And I do this shit casually, before the first end
I'll be in the Hall of Fame with my picture framed friend

[Krizz Kaliko]
And if it wasn't for (my music)
Yeah, I wouldn't be standing here
If it wasn't for (my music)
You wouldn't have nothing to hear, yeah
And I love

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I love music (I need it to live)
I love music (it's almost a gift)
I love music (yeah, and I love it)
I love music (this time I'ma be quiet, shh)
... (and I love)
I love music (showing I love it)
I love music (whoa-oh)
