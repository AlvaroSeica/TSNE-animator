go ...

go to the mountain if you must
go to the burning bush
happy would easy your troubled mind
I'd be prepared to stay behind

I know you better than you think I do
don't worry dear, this is why I fell in love with you
the man in the looking glass
is looking back at you at last

you can't hide from the truth
because the truth is all there is (x3)
you can't hide ...

if happy times are too few and far between
it's a pity dear
we can't erase the things we've seen
so disappear
vanish if you wish
just go before you're swallowed up by fatalists
the truth is you can't hide from the truth
and the truth hurts because the truth is all there is
I realized some time ago
that I would have to let you go

it may not be true to say
that you'll return one day
but in your present state
you may as well not be here at all
you wear a thin disguise
it's from yourself you hide
just take a look at us
we are heading for a fall

[J-Live]
now presiding in this court of hip hop
justice, my rap forte
is judge, jury, bailiff, or prosecutin DA
cause ceteris paribus
my modus operandi
is carpe diem
whether de facto or de jure
comprende?
the people versus
you and your sensei
teachin that style of wordplay
weaker than Wednesday
regardless of what your friends say
they're all dissable
stricken from the record
and deemed inadmissible
why this long arm of the law grabs the mic
to shoot dope lines first and ask questions later
the death sentences of this live litigator
close a case tighter than the jaws of a gator
stenographers are steady loggin
the jargon that your counselors are barkin
in hopes of a plea bargain
but when you read back verbatim
what they sayin to persuade them
they realize exactly how I played them
I come with the truth, whole truth, and nothing but
cause the truth hurts just as much as fucking with Live will
I prove skills with refills from now until
plagiarizing MCs get their flows to steal

[Roisin Murphy]
baby I won't die
without you by my side
as long as you return
to these arms that burn
baby I won't die
just take a look inside
into these eyes that burn
come to these arms that yearn
I won't die if you leave me high
I won't die if you're by my side

and the truth hurts because the truth is all there is (x2)

you can't hide from the truth
cause the truth is all there is (x8)</pre>
