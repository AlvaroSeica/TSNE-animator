[Chorus 2x]
See me and my folk ride for blocks and blocks
And me and my folk like to set up shop
Sippin forty's, then get right fluid
I'm the nigga that make ya ass wanna do it

[Verse 1]
Now me and my folk just do it, and get right fluid
We get your girl, we get her crunk and get her to it
Now me and my folk run a gang of hoes 
Get so tight with it we runnin' a train of hoes
Now me and my folk rob niggas in drag
We make the toughest motherfucker in here run like a fag
Now me and my folk make nothin but hits
And keep your ass straight crunk, we don't spit with this shit
We got that break em off beat, that knock you off your feet
That shit to make an honest bitch wanna cheat
Y'all fuck niggas can't touch me in this game
Cause y'all keep droppin bullshit that sound the same
Now me and my folk like to hit the club
Drink up half the bar, and don't spend shit but a dub
Now me and my folk, they high as a kite
Because we smoke all day and all motherfucking night

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
Now me and my folk like to glide on lifts
We ride for blocks and blocks until we find the right
With your town so hard, we have a nigga shedding tears
And run you off the street you've been servin on for years
Don't give a fuck about you screaming that you want your corner back
You can have the bitch back, soon as we jump these sacks
Now me and my folk don't talk no shit
We get to it head first when you get like a bitch
Now me and my folk smoke blounts till we choke
Put the bitch out, leave, come back and find for broke
Now me and my folk bout wilin hell
We crunk everywhere we go actin wild as hell

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3]
Now me and my folk will fuck you up bout some shit like this
Cause this original made, and scratch without that bullshit
The place is drawn made the music cause it fit in the gee??
We got y'all bouncin like the booty when the freak girls in
Now we the coldest motherfuckers to make 'em freeze up when we enter
With no ice, the niggas that standing in the center
The flows nice, now all the ones they thinking ??? night
Now they thinking twice, now my folks ??? ride on 'em shawty
Now keep it hitting like we throwing them thangs
Switch didn't know that the niggas down they be simple and plain
Now I'm the one man in the same game that flip-flop and hold they thangs
Bring the pain when I aim, and change the whole damn route
Have you spinning in a circle turn from out in a daze
Call breaking barely cause you gone need help from getting out this maze
And I'm gone dunk dunk dunk, dunk dunk dunk always 
You can't fuck with me and my folk cause we get to it and get paid

[Chorus repeat till fade] </pre>
