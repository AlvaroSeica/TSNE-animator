[Verse 1]
(Suffa)
Growing up I needed a guide like, a blind veteran's dog
Cos I was going nowhere like a child's letters to God
Though life's road was hard I was never so lost
That I looked for an answer in a medicine box
I never did pop pills, or cop deals, just rocked hills
Kids with skills, still got harassed by the cops till
They'd have me in the back of a paddy, down to lock up
Smack me, pat me down for a baggy, mums would rock up
And bail me out, a failure out once again
Next weekend, bail me out, drunk again
And I never will forgive myself
For putting you through all that hell
I went from high school dropout to factory labourer
Slave to the clock until four, went from sleeping on the floor
To being out on tour, now no stopping me
I'll finish with a bang like Kurt Cobains biography

[Chorus]
Going down a hard road, down the hard road
Don't know where I've been, and don't know where to go its like
Going down a hard road, down the hard road
Don't know where I've been

[Verse 2]
(Pressure)
I spent my youth like life was cheap
The only change that I wanted was enough to buy a drink
Was on a path to nowhere, the harder the road
The more broken baggage we carry the larger the load
This school drop-out got knocked out, chased by the cops out
Got clout, dumped by my girlfriend and locked out
Been broke and beaten, even chocked at being
A dope mc but never lost hope in dreaming
We used to thrash boosted cars till the engine would fail
If I never had bailed maybe I'd be dead or in jail
And man I got no one else to blame
I thank my family and music for keeping me sane
But that's the breaks right? Started working late nights
Never seeing daylight, getting paid like a slave might
And I've done too many years to miss this for my missus
To have to tell my son he nearly never existed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
(Suffa)
And I speak what I feel in the booth in the spirit of truth
Cos all these kids that I meet man they mirror my youth
And I could have gone the wrong way, the easy option
But I chose to go the long way, the streets are watching
So keep a look out, look up, B-Ballers keep your hook up
Tear a page from my book out, and pull out
Your finger put your foot out and keep a lookout
For what we put out, the brand new flavour for your cookout

[Chorus]</pre>
