Song:   Cockroach Goddess
Typed by: jmanshiphop@hotmail.com

She's my cockroach goddess, promise my shoe will never fall upon you
And if it ever does, ill cry myself to sleep covered in your blood
That's love, she's my drug, release the doves
Just because she was everything I ever was
It all started with a hole in the carpet
Cupid aimed the arrow, my heart was the target
Tell the exterminator not to come or approach
Cuz no police or Orkin man could ever take my roach
I'm in my stage coach, here's a toast to the girl I loved the most
It's a damn shame that .38 made her a ghost
Now I'm in Mexico with a little bit of mescaline and coke
Of course I'm the same 
I just got a little bit of horse in my veins
I'm galloping looking for that yage I'm sorry
It was an Aztec sacrifice and not even Cortez could stop me
Blink once, I'm home trying to find that face I fancy
If these walls could talk, they would scream like a banshee
My eyes are dancing I'm looking for her in the pantry
Damn she's gone, guess that's why I had to write this god damn song

Shot glass on the head
Better yet apple arrow
Let me take a shot, I hope I don't miss (don't miss)
If I do you will be missed
I missed, I'm pissed
All that's left is a hole in the wall from my fist

I'm still on the run
But I'm safe cuz that lake swallowed my gun
Now I'm alone I got time to pass
Cuz of that bloody shattered shot glass
When I close my eyes I see her crawling on the wall I can't escape her
Cuz her face and mine are on every newspaper
Her last words were
"I can't watch this you know I can't stand the site of blood"
But the only witnesses were this shovel and the mud
She was the only one that had the patience for me
She could adapt to my problems and even take radiation for me
But ill get off trial court fines ain't nothing pesos pay my fees
I see her when I blink, her eyelashes were a narcotic
I got an infection called guilt and addiction's my anti-biotic
She was my bed bug fianc√©, my fountain of youth like Ponce
I asked for forgiveness 3000 times you could call me Andre
I was her Jacky, she was my Maggie Cassidy
The feds came to my house and we're asking for me
I said you think god created this world that's blasphemy
Why would he create hell, go ahead boys in blue sand castle me
She used to give me lap dances now she's
A roach belly dancing on her back
She never came home I called up my man doc he told me to relax
I opened up my closest she was dead, I killed her with my own traps
And that's the facts

Shot glass on the head
Better yet apple arrow
Let me take a shot, I hope I don't miss (don't miss)
If I do you will be missed
I missed, I'm pissed
All that's left is a hole in the wall from my fist</pre>
