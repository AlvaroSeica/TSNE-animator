[Verse One: Necro]
Cockroaches
Billions greeting, roaming around since Genesis
Coming out through the crevices
Infested, walls filled with termites
Busting through drool, looking for food
Coming out when there's no light!
They're small, but they make, human's nervous
You'll do a spastic jerk, if you spot a cold one on your epidermis
If you squeamish, you're save provided,
When you sleep you keep your mouth closed, cause yo they might crawl up inside it
Uninvited, from out the Earth's core
Bugs are the only species that will probably survive a nuclear war
And as you snore, they like to run to your door
Then explore, you won't notice when they're on your upside down floor
Schemin', he sees food it causes poison
but some ain't smart enough to eraid the exterminator's poison
So the pest takes it back to his nest
contacting with another infected begins to infect the rest
A lot die, but it's only a small fraction - we can't catch 'em
because there's always new eggs hatchin'

[Chorus One:]
COCKROACHES!

[Verse Two: Necro]
Cockroaches, many perceive as evil
But if you're from The Projects, them niggas are like people!
They sleep with you, eat with you, listen and beef with you
Thousand times you get in your couch, they'll reproduce
They conceive they're crew, roaches got there own army
generals, colonels, lieutenant, invading tenants
Your crib becomes a big roach motel, for all sorts of bugs
Poor homes for that can't afford ?? free cockroach ?drugs?
From out the cupboard, crawling into crisis
I got baby roaches inside my full pint, camouflaging in spices
Once by accident, I ate 'em with my rice kid
Cause, when you're hungry you don't think twice kid
Yo there ain't a person on earth that never ate an insect,
Cause every food warehouse in the US they infect
I used to give roaches funeral buyers, wrap 'em up - 
in toilet paper, still alive and light em on fire!
So watch out, they'll come to get you, they're malicious
No crew parties, up in your sink, swimming up to your dishes

[Chorus Two]
