[Intro]
This is it y'all, it's some nasty shit
Bring it!

[MCA]
Jump out the window onto a parade balloon
My style is iller than the goblins in {?}
I'm the type of emcee with the most pizazz
You're stealin my book, like I was Grandmaster Caz
Got rhymes about antihistamines and analgesics
Roll without expectorants; y'all don't see it
Soothsayer, not a player, rhyme sayer extreme (huh!)
Burn like fire when I step on the scene
I got, sharks' teeth so I can bite your head
I got, tigers' claws that'll scratch you dead
I got, wings like a dragon when I'm flyin above
Shoot venom from my eyes when it's time to get rough
Now step back... and check yourself
This emcee's got weapons that'll ruin your health
So if you're feelin swoll, then reach for yours
My book is my shield, and my mic is my sword
Sword, sword, sword, sword

[Ad Rock]
Now, it's Ad Rock rappin I'm back again
Like a Big Mac attack on your gut, and it's wack my friend
I'm a mack so relax or end up chillin
I take that shit serious like Jerome DeQuillan
I'll burn you to a crisp, sucker back up off the toaster
I'll make you sick like a Kenny Rogers roaster
See this rap thing is all about the the braggadocia
I check my rearview, emcees ain't gettin closer
People think I'm slow, cause I'm just not one to challenge
See me and my band is a raw group of talent
Fly around the clock like disco donut
I'm like a tampon cause I got the pink soda
Over rock I make hits that move asses
Rhyme so much heat that I fog your mom's glasses
Proof is in the pudding and the pudding's in my pants
You heard me rappin now watch me dance

[Mike D]
Save the date! For one name who deliver to the rafters
Up from the heavens you can hear our laughter
Like goodness me, or empty john
We done did it again, and our game is still on
It's not tic-tac-toe, or Operation
Just holdin it down, like the gravitation
Total hits, that's it, you couldn't do
Ad Rock's in the bathroom now check the fondue
String of nuts, like the name is Mike Pizzini
Or a fine household name, like Sergio Tacini
Now that we're here, back and raising hell
I'm runnin wild like rats in the Taco Bell
On the mic I shit, the match gets lit
Mike Dino, the Jew is rampant
Makin music from librarians to curly jocks
The rapper Mike D not Gold-i-locks! {*laughing*}
