Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Kevin Cossum - Intro]
Girl what you grabbin' cash for?
All you need is your passport...

[Kevin Cossom - Chorus]
What you know about this life
Just relax baby get high
You're on your way to the best night ever
No top on the car (no top, no top)
Out with the stars (yeah)
You're on your way to the best night ever
(Bitch don't mess this up for yourself...)

[Wale]
Forgetting time spending several minutes in her eyes
When in her mind it be feeling different in her thighs
And she'll advise, giving hours to another broad
'Cause what is love if you ain't discover loving hard
A nigga thorough she knew it before I pull the car
She pretty but she insecure as baby momma scars
Everything got a flaw, we desire perfection
Body pad as hell, her vagina is heaven
And her mind is amazing, different kind of connection
Love is for optimistic, no she try and convince me
And her body is steaming, how I need it revealing
Not a product on the market that can offer this feeling
It's so hard for civilians, thank God you were the boss
You found a prince without losing slippers or kissing frogs
Don't get too far, just play your part, I break you off
And one day you'll get my all it's Inshallah

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Open your eyes wide, riding in the Rolls Royce
Keep your mouth closed, you fucking with a dope boy
Everybody watching while you touching real money
I'm only rocking with the niggaz that'll kill for me
My hood bitches, even got Â‘em rocking heels for me
All the jewels on, got about a mill on me
Date a strippers but the bitches wanna feel on me
Third bottle feeling like they slip the pill on me
These niggaz snitch and catch a case and cut a deal on me
So fuck a song, writing poems for the real homies
One life to live but they all doing life bids
Everybody coming home deserve a white Benz
Hoes gossip while the real niggaz on the grind
Gucci rocking this gold rolly, I'm rocking mine
Baby told me that she never memorized a verse
Until the day I put a 100k inside her purse

[Chorus]</pre>
