konvict......konvict......konvict
ohhh....ohh....ohhh.....

[Chorus]
nobody wanna see us together
but it don't matter no...
cause I got you babe
nobody wanna see us together
but it don't matter no....
cause I got you babe
cause we gon' fight
oh yes we gon' fight
believe we gon' fight
fight for our right to love yeah....
nobody wanna see us together
but it don't matter no....
(cause I got you babe)

[Chorus]
nobdoy wanna see us together
nobody thought we'd last forever
I feel I'm hoping and praying
things between us gon get better
men steady coming after you
women steady coming after me
seems like everybody wanna go for self
and don't wanna respect bountry
telling you all those lies
just to get on your side
but I must admit there was a couple secrets I held inside
just know that I try
to always apologize
I'ma have you first always in my heart to keep you satisfied

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
got every right to wanna leave
got every right to wanna go
got every right to hit the road
and never talk to me no more
you don't ever have to call
even check for me at all
cause the way I been acting lately has been off the wall
espicially towards you....
putting girls before you...
and they watching everything I been dong just to hurt you
most of it just ain't true
and they gon' show you
how much of a queen you are to me and why I love you baby...

[Chorus]

oohhh....ohhh......ohh.....
cause I got you babe
oohhh....ohhh.....oh....
cause I got you babe
cause I got you babe
cause I got you babe

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
