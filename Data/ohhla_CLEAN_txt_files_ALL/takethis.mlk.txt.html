[Intro 2X: Miilkbone]
Come and take this rii-ide, baby
And let love get lii-ive, baby
I'll even let you dri-ive, baby
If I can park insi-ide

[Miilkbone]
I pulled up, picked her up like 6 o'clock
She came out the house with a body like I'm Sir Mix-A-Lot
Got the fly car, fly girl, my masterpiece
Dressed in caramel, skin color tone match the seats
Only difference she's got a fast release, I tell her
My car's like my love and you can help me keep it greased
Hit the park on route 69, the hard way
We might crash, c'mon now girl I got triple weight
You know me better than that, my tires never been flat
Turned on the radio, Mariah made her lay the seat back
Let me teach you how to drive my stick, slide my shit
Like ba-ba-bump in traffic, I wanted her to match it

[Chorus: Miilkbone] + (female)
Come and take this rii-ide, baby
And let love get lii-ive, baby
I'll even let you dri-ive, baby
If I can park insi-ide
(Come and take this ride, baby)
(Make me wet inside, baby)
(Show me you can drive, baby)
Every night girl I wanna stick shift you

[Miilkbone]
Without the birds and bees, crack the window for a breeze
My engine block's hot and I'm leakin my antifreeze
Task undress, I feel like I'm blessed, car's a mess
Sex in the stretch, gas pedal prints, dent ya headrest
I'm vexed, her legs split, every intersection
I'll never steer you wrong, we got airbag protection
Maps for directions and you be like damn
You drive excellent, so cool you pump fuel-injection
The rest of her ass passed the bad gas inspection
Spaced out from milk jets and car collection
My finger wheels rollin down the back street creepin
Can't hang, by the first block you'll be sleepin

[Chorus]

[Miilkbone]
Tonight is all about havin me park her in the car
Start at the bar, drive off, it's off with the bra
Opened the hood, check her emission before after and during
But - your only fill her with fluids to keep her engine purrin
What the fuck, it's like if you gettin raped, knuckle up
You sexin, you don't feel safe then buckle up - dummy
Showed her, pulled over, revvin my motor thighs
On my shoulder ride by, the sex super like sober
Squirt squirt I be doin work work
Takin off her shirt flirt, kick up dirt, make the highway hurt
Got the handle that can stop the car, knock you off
If you don't want me I can't wait to drop you off

We in my Lexus - yeah, we in the Beemer - uh huh
We in Benz, we in Cadillac - c'mon
We in a sport truck, we in a hooptie - yeah that's what I'm talkin about
A BMW or in back of the Ac' c'mon

[Chorus] - 2X </pre>
