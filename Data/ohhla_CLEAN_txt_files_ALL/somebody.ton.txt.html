[Verse 1]
I don't know the reason
I don't know his name
But someone's really trying to kill me
I've seen him fly a plane right into a building
I've seen him in the eyes of the poorest children
He puts the saturated fat in your KFC
the multiple choice question in the HSC
censorship on the ABC, yeah, he sells off your roads and your water and your
health-care G!
Someone's really trying to kill me, you heard it first
They looked me up on Google Earth
Surrounded the house with a Blockbuster video, bank and a petrol station
I'm inside pearing out the blinds like Malcolm
X-tremely defensive, determined to fight off infection
The outcome is life or death
Gonna have ta clean up my act if I'ma live through this mess
cos...

[Chorus]
Somebody's trying to kill me
His record is clean but his mind is filthy
He's after my dreams, I just wanna be healthy
Can't you hear his name when the cold wind blows?
Sombody's trying to kill me
He's doing it slow, I won't make it to fifty
He'll end your career if you think too quickly
Can't you hear his name when the cold wind blows?

[Verse 2]
He makes funds from the smoke that you pull into your lungs and the
bullets that you put into your guns
Got an empirer built on prescription drugs
I'm 22 now how long can I run?
The sneakers on my feet got his name on the tag
He bought me a ticket for a plane to Iraq
From a distance he kinda looks the same as my dad
Middle-aged and white, won't give away the mic
or my right to resist cos
Life is a bitch but death is her ugly sister
We all in danger, stuffing our big mouths with candy from a stranger
Sugar in your alcohol to add flavour 
Fumes in the air for you and your neighbour
His hearts black as ink on the Sunday paper
But I got dreams of better living
He's two-faced so I'ma make sure the whole head is missing

[Chorus]
Somebody's trying to kill me
His record is clean but his mind is filthy
He's after my dreams, I just wanna be healthy
Can't you hear his name when the cold wind blows?
Sombody's trying to kill me
He's doing it slow, I won't make it to fifty
He'll end your career if you think too quickly
Can't you hear his name when the cold wind blows?</pre>
