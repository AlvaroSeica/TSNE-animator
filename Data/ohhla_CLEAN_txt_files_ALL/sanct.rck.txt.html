[Intro: Betty Wright]
There's a few million angels movin' around me
I just WORSHIP thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been BORN again
I've been BORN again, I've been BORN again
In His spirit, and His name, I'm SANCTIFIED!
Lord I testify, he's right by my side
I believe it be His word is SO CLEAR to me
YEAH, YEAH~!!

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Okay, all I want's 100 million dollars and a bad, bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a sa-vage (uh-huh)
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get estab-lished (uh-huh)
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my sta-tus

[Kanye West]
All I wanted was 100 million dollars and a bad, bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a sa-vage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get estab-lished
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my sta-tus

Niggas be lovin' the old Ye, they sayin' "the new Ye, that nigga be spazzin'"
But when Ali turn up and be Ali, you can't ever change that nigga back to Cassius
So you can gon' and make up lies, but I'm so sanctified
I don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of, JESUS! (HUH!)
People sayin', "Ye we need another, YEEZUS" (HUH!)
Lames try to tell me, "Cut the wilin' out, out"
But who the FUCK is you reachin'?!
Pass me 30 bottles, champagne procession
That's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message, said I'm too aggressive
Really?! ME?! Too AGGRESSIVE?!

[Interlude: Betty Wright]
I can feel his blessings WASH away my sins
I'm sanctified and, ohh, I have been BORN again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy NAAAAAME
Ohhhhh...

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Keys to my success, I get new keys and new address
Bitches that I date don't get degrees but they can dress
Felatio's amazin', make grilled cheese for you, the best (WOO!)
Major cult figure, I'm the fresh David Koresh {M-M-M}
Soldiers all in gators, new Mercedes for cadets
Balmain uniform, you know Donda designed the vest
Double M, that be the Army (HUH!) better yet, the Navy (HUH!)
Baby seen me in that Wraith, wanna have my baby
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad, bitch
Now I want two hundred and mÃ©nage in my pal-ace
Walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' bal-ance
Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chal-ice
Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was child-ish
'Til I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was sty-lish (HUH!)
When we fucked again, she told me "That was just some foul, shit"
I walk into the room, you can even hear all the si-lence
