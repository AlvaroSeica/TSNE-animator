[Intro: Twon Gabz]
Def Squad! Yo!

[Verse One: Twon Gabz]
I see plots under disguises, lies under toned in the tone
Of another grown man like damn what the fuck he on?!
Child's Play and like Chucky's clone
Good fortune moved out his house, so his luck is gone
Frontin like nothin's wrong, that's who I'm lookin out for
Niggas grillin me like they livin and cookin outdoors
So I'm keepin my mouth closed and my eyes wide
Come at me get that beef pattie like five guys
Y'all cakes is soft flakes Raisin Brand
My phrase is make a man take a stand Doc Frankenstand
It's the weirdest science, it's clear defiance
Eat up the cats like lions, they fear alliance
Niggas look at the stars, wishin they had cars
But ain't no genies in the bottle only cush in jars
They look at ours, and compare with there's
Ballin out over here don't meanin missin hairs
There grimey catch me if you find me
I walk with a rear view mirror to see behind me
That's not paranoia that's bein alert
It separates from bein alive to bein in dirt

[Chorus: Twon Gabz] (Sample)
Huh! You got that bread watch your back ("LOOK OUT!") 
Niggas, wish they had what you got ("LOOK OUT!") 
Wait! Hold up what's that?! ("LOOK OUT!") 
Homey you better ("LOOK OUT!") Don't let 'em catch you like ("AHHHHHHH!!!")
Huh! You got that bread watch your back ("LOOK OUT!") 
Niggas, wish they had what you got ("LOOK OUT!") 
Wait! Hold up what's that?! ("LOOK OUT!") 
Homey you better ("LOOK OUT!") Don't let 'em catch you like ("AHHHHHHH!!!")

[Verse Two: Erick Sermon]
Huh! Everyday I wake up Twon it's good news
I feel dynamite like I'm Tom or Cruise
OOOH! I do's it (HOW COME?) The best could 
Mr. International you see me on Westwood
London I'm there on a first class ticket
I'm a star, 'cause that's how Beckett I kick it
The band and yeah, I'm runnin rapid
Access is granted so I'm takin advantage, damnit
Yeah! I'm underrated (Uh!)
I'm important like when life was created by God when he made it
Yeah! You a loser I am the future
Even though, I'm the past I'm the future
Still that producer, makin that Elroy Jetson (Uh Huh!)
The next shit, can't you hear this perfection
Feel my aggression nigga 
I'm hungry, great depression nigga
Twenty pounds gone I changed my whole figure
Jesus piece around your neck and you a killer
UMMM!!! Go figure
Yeah! You keep sayin you a gangsta?! Please!
You a saint, and doin you would be a Drew Brees

[Chorus: Twon Gabz] (Sample)
Huh! You got that bread watch your back ("LOOK OUT!") 
Niggas, wish they had what you got ("LOOK OUT!") 
Wait! Hold up what's that?! ("LOOK OUT!") 
Homey you better ("LOOK OUT!") Don't let 'em catch you like ("AHHHHHHH!!!")
Huh! You got that bread watch your back ("LOOK OUT!") 
Niggas, wish they had what you got ("LOOK OUT!") 
Wait! Hold up what's that?! ("LOOK OUT!") 
Homey you better ("LOOK OUT!") Don't let 'em catch you like ("AHHHHHHH!!!")</pre>
