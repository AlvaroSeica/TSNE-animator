[Intro/Chorus: singers]
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh
Gu-cci, gu-ooh-ooh-ci
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh
Gucci! Gucci, ahh
Nothing's gonna stop my reign - ahh, ahh
Nothing's gonna stop my reign - ahh, ahh

[Gucci Mane]
(Go!) Hurtin my opponents, runnin through problems
Unstoppable, I jump over obstacles
Stop my grind like stoppin sunshine so improbable
Probably mission impossible
I said it two times nigga, nigga stop lyin
Nigga what'chu sellin? I am just not buyin
Flow so nice but the kid's not kind
I swear it's sicker than a new fruit I got called swine
Standin on twine like a uniform, trap with a uniform
Everyday's a work day but don't wear a uniform
Gucci Mane a dapper don, capper like a Capricorn
Trapper man goin on a money makin marathon
Hey yo Joker, I be robbin/Robin
and the +Riddler+ is the Batman's stone
Try not to fuck my money up
and rap career like Pac-Man Jones (damn!)
Don't print me, fingerprint me
But can we agree to disagree?
I'm from East Atlanta 6 where the boy dump bricks
but we don't bump "The Blueprint 3"
Nigga box me just like Master P
But you can't fuck me like +Recipe+
Like Ali, I'ma float like a butterfly
Sting like a bee cause it's big Gucci, Gucci

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Streets derailed me, they God damn failed me
Opportunity knocked, but it just e-mailed me
D.A. nail me, watch me, jail me
Take it like a champ while the world mail me
Momma don't like it, Jay out-sell me
Nothin in the world Kanye could tell me
You can be any one but Gucci
Jaw so hard I can hardly do it (YEAHHHH~!)
Cause whoever that I hurt you should live that movement
Bang from your hip chest to your new unit
Convicted felon, my little friends jailed an'
My stash ego and my bozack swellin
Crazy, so I need Prozac, really
My home kept scarry and my folk so eerie
So heartbroken that my folk fell weary
Fall in the club and the hoe starts cheerin
So hear me hear me, I know y'all hear me
I don't like writin too much, not really
High like Britney, stoned like Jimmy
Got a second chance like Vick in Philly
This is rap music, this is trap music
Blue boys in Kelly yeah they got a jerk movement
Brick Squad niggaz we rep the block
Gucci Mane I will thwart these cops

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
