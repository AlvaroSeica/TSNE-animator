[Meek Mill]
I said I'm cooler than a fan fresh like it's easter
Pull up on that bitch and be like Osta Laviestah
Heser thought that's what they all say geezers
I just fucked her yesterday homie you can keep
Her believe her I don't do noffin I 'ma ball I'm a stand
Up nigga I jump up every time I fall (every time I lost ha)
I came back like cooked crack got my head up in the
Game and I ain't never look back (never) I said I'm good
I'm a hood I wish a nigga would try to take me for a sucker
He get hit up if be could can't shake up for noffin they
Be hatin but for what cause I anit even get a deal but
When I do they be like UHH! Sick ya bitch all up on my
Dick, cause you a bust, you a flee and I'm a G, I ain't no
Crip I ain't no blood but I don't benel I don't budge I keep
That semi by my girl that nigga took me fire up I let that shit
Blow write em up, I said I ain't got that henley, U know I got
That good shit Niggas rolling on that dirt they be smokin that
Reggie Bush Cause they always speak my name but when
They see me they never look cause they know I keep that
Flamers hold up that a nova book I said them shooters on deck
