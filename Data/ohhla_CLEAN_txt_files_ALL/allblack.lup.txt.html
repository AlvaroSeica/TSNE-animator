Sometimes, you just gotta ... go!

[Chorus - Lupe Fiasco]
You will never know, what you could ever be
If you never try, you will never see
Stayed in Africa, we ain't never leave
So there were no slaves, in our history
(All black every-thing ...)
Were no slave ships, or no misery
Call me crazy, or isn't he?
See I fell asleep and I had a dream
It was all black, everything
(All black, all black, every-thing ...)

[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, and we ain't get exploited
White man ain't fear it, so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together, so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by the W.E.B. Du Bois
Were no reconstructions, Civil War got avoided
Little black Sambo grows up to be a lawyer
"Extra, extra" on the newsstands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as an old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill O'Reilly, who read from the Qur'an
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where, FOX News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins the Mandela Peace Prize
(All black every-thing ...)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, and it ain't no projects
Keepin it real's not an understood concept
Yeah, complexion's not a contest
'Cause, racism has no context
Hip-hop ain't got a section called conscious
Everybody rappin like crack never happened
Crips never occurred, no Bloods to attack then
Matter of fact, no hood to attack in
Somalia's a great place to relax in
Fred Astaire was the first to do a backspin
The Rat Pack was a cool group of black men
That inspired five white guys called The Jackson's
Eminem fitted in
But then again he inspired a black rapper tryin to mimic him
And that's what really rose up out of Michigan
Then sign a white rapper by the name of 50 Cent (ha!)
(All black every-thing ...)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy
I cordially invite you to ask, why can't it be?
Now we can't do nothin about the past
But we can do somethin about the future that we have
We can make it fast or we can make it last
Every woman Queen and every man a King and
When those colored lines come, we can't see between
We just close our eyes 'til it's all black every-thing
(All black every-thing ...)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs until the end</pre>
