Song:   Dirty Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Ke$ha] It's Iggy Pop!
[Iggy Pop] Yeah, and Kesha
[Ke$ha] Alright, get 'em!
[Iggy Pop] Yeah!

[Ke$ha]
Don't want your money, I've got my own
You're not my daddy, baby I'm full-grown
Don't complicate it, don't tell me lies
I'm not your girlfriend, and I ain't never gonna be
Or your wife!

I just want your dirty love
I just want your dirty love
All I need is tucked in-between your jeans
I just want your dirty love
I just want your dirty love

[Iggy Pop]
Cockroaches do it in the garbage cans
Rug merchants do it in Afghanistan
Santorun did it in a V-neck sweater
Pornos produce it
But a wild child can do it better

[Ke$ha]
I just want your dirty love
I just want your dirty love
All I need is tucked in-between your jeans
I just want your dirty love
I don't want your fancy things
([Iggy Pop] I just want your love)
Champagne tastes like piss to me
([Iggy Pop] I just want your love)
Keep your leopard limousine
([Iggy Pop] I just want your love)
I just want your fucking dirty love

I just want your dirty love
I just want your dirty love
All I need is tucked in-between your jeans
I just want your dirty love
I just want your dirty love
I just want your dirty love</pre>
