[Intro]
I'm chargin sixteen fever
Sixteen fever, nigga my price cheaper
Sixteen fever...

[Chorus: repeat 2X] + "nigga" after 2X repeat
Sixteen fever, cocallina
X pills, bubble kush, mid grade reefer
Hoes ridin dicks dawg but I'll ride Beemer
I swear the rectangle cost you sixteen fever

[Gucci Mane]
Sixteen five oh, there go five-oh
I'm up two-five but I need fo' mo'
I got uncles, blowin bundles
Mine do numbers while I drive Lambo'
Off white yayo, digital scale
Fishscale sendin my pigeons by mail
Bring in my trap folk, stash it to white folk
Go straight to black folk, just bring me that game folk
Gucci got good dope, pills purp and sizzurp
My workers don't move nothin less than the bizzurp
Gucci got good dope, pills purp and sizzurp
My workers don't move for nothin less than a bizzurp

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Bricks can't keep 'em, sixteen fever
Beemer speakers, geek-ups, heaters
Misdemeanors, several subpoenas
See I'm gon' drink up, cause we just linked up
The squad been teamed up, we cuttin off fingers
It's sixteen fever, been that'since April
My Corvette paid for, my old school paid for
The Hummer roll up, that means you assed out
And you didn't cash out, see this my trap house
I slam fiends backs out, we push white sacks out
See this my trap house, I slam fiends backs out
We push white sacks out, them backs get pushed out

[Gucci Mane]
I'm scrapin the bowl up, I'm whippin up cake mix
But this ain't red velvet, don't eat it just smoke it
Your options are open, you even can snort it
Three dollar sacks so you know you can score it
Say you can't afford it, yo I can ignore it
Well don't call them dope boys, you know you feel borin
You know that you fiendin, you know that you need it
It's Gucci, I'm greedy, my niggaz stay eatin nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
