[Childish Gambino]
Yo, a-mazing
This is royalty man
Yeah, we royalty, you ain't know that?
Better use the royal 'we' around us
"It's royalty"

Who the fuck Gambino? This nigga on your TiVo?
My hotel cost a kilo, I'm banking like a free throw
Fuck y'all, we A-Team, y'all Plan B like Walgreens
Cop that shit and paint it black, niggas want they summer back?
Ha-ha, no way, Hublots, Dolce
Beans in my hand, girl in the car
She still with her man, but she seeing me tomorrow
Homegirl on that Master P, watch us ball like referees
Unnecessary roughness? We just trying to function
Used to sport them Filas cause my cousin packed them heaters
We don't wife 'em like Khalifa, we just party, then we leave 'em
Tell 'em that we hitting, we don't really see 'em
My girl look best when she only wear a fitted
Q and 'Bino in the house and you niggas in the senate, get it?

[Chorus 1: Childish Gambino]
Four-thou' on my fit? That's unnecessary
Skiing in Japan? That's unnecessary
Molly on my rider? That's unnecessary
'Bino spit that fire? That ain't even necessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
Roll out on a plane? That's unnecessary
'Tussin and champagne? Nigga, that ain't even necessary

[ScHoolboy Q]
Yo, they said don't buy the belt and I got it
They said don't get the Rollie and I bought it
Uh, nigga, I'm balling
My fucking mixtape can get you through college, getting them dollars
Showing my pearly white teeth, I'm a nigga that's flawless
Came a long way from dumping out Impalas
Same gun and pants, different ski mask from coppers, all of this copper
Knock knock, who could it be? Niggas know I got it on lock
Yawk, yawk, bitch rappers better move 'fore them niggas get dropped
Uh, Mr. Flop Boy, you got your label hot
I'm the hardest out, you's a tablecloth
Unnecessary balling, I was carted off
Uh, been fucking on my side bitch so much, my main bitch can't stand it, haha
Hundred racks in three months, man this shit is outstanding, uh
Seen a dollar go to stupid racks, billion, trillion
Nigga, that's what I call building
'Bino, what it do? Let's go half on a million

[Chorus 2: Childish Gambino]
Bathroom DVR? That's unnecessary
Cushion in that bulletproof? That's unnecessary
Stunting at the mall? That's unnecessary
Condo on my arm? That ain't even unnecessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
Ibiza for a day? That's unnecessary
Shows, a hundred K? Nigga, that ain't even unnecessary

[Ab-Soul]
Black Lip Bastard, actual natural disaster
I did a song about DMT, Soulja Boy did one right after
Three eyes, these guys ain't seeing me, no radio showed up over B.o.B.
G-O-D emcee, I'm the Devil with angel wings
'Pilot Talk', Curren$y, stole the show, burglary
I love that flow, but I got more, open condoms in condos
Open bottles of Moet White, with white girls in Eugene
We used to call hoes on three-way, and take 'em out to the movies
and now we just do it always, she driving stick in the driveway
Just popped a molly with Molly, she do shrooms every blue moon
Hundred million, trillion mother-fucking racks nigga
Pinot Grigio, the lean'll go in that nigga
Now that's unnecessary, been a legend since elementary
Aiyyo 'Bino, tell these niggas I ain't no joke
She don't need speech, she ain't giving no throat
You are under my control, suspender Ls, but I'm on a roll
Grade A, honor roll, Mayday, 'Soul!</pre>
