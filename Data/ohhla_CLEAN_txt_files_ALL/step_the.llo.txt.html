[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Stone Rangers, E.S.G, yessa yessa my lord

[Lounge Lo]
I ride the streets like I'm O.G. Hubert
Blowin' medula, tell Hef to step back, they couldn't step in our shoes
Park Hill gangsta shit, man, we far from fools
E.S.G., Stone Gang, that's what's happenin', dude
Got Milli Milli to bust, tell Fresh to get 'em
I'm in the lobby burnin' a pif, plus tryin' to get it
Two guns up, P-Block, D-Block is old news
It's Beez Mode, ease flow, he go old school
Wrap a nigga neck with a red scar, you dead par
Ya time is up, this no game like hedgehog
But fuck y'all bitches even though y'all head's hard
A bulletproof tough, you can't kill my kevlaar
L.G. in the cut, man, sippin' a Red Star
Me, I probably breeze to a show in Meth's car
And peal off in double deuces, I've got the Benz Coupes
And it's me, O.B., y'all know the kid do this

[Interlude: Lounge Lo]
Kid, y'all know what time it is, man
I got Booga K with the kid, man
I got Hef with the kid, man
Y'all know my drill, man

[Chorus 2X: Hue Hefna]
Step the fuck back, you know them dudes is comin'
We won't lose cuz them tools is bustin', nigga
Step the fuck back, get the fuck out our way
Or you gon' see more drama than Kayslay, nigga

[Interlude: Lounge Lo (Black Boogs)]
Yeah, I got my son from the hood, man
Up the block, man (It gets no better)
Tell 'em, my dude, scream at 'em!

[Black Boogs]
Yo, I play for the seven brick money, four ton, sonny
Three days, four nights and Cuban money
Mr. Big Boog play with chicks that's fine
One bulge from the hip, one fifth, the other one nine
Them dirty south bitches, slash for the lucci
Be up in the mall with ya stash buyin' Gucci
While I cop a goat, what they don't see they don't know
Pretenders they're killas, undercover guerillas
Burners, spit more fire than Godzilla
That's besides the point, I'm tryin' to take this like Nino
No crumble, big riff, still play the jungle
That's a diplomat, mad money, no wife, life's trife
Tricky, while little Suzy done slipped the Mickey
Breeze down to left canopy, that be the fantasy
In reality, it was death, she cut ya neck
You'se a lame, stuck in the game, there's no fame

[Interlude: Lounge Lo]
That's right, that's right
Y'all thought it was a gi-dame?
Y'all fuckin' li-dames
It ain't done, man, talk to me!

[Chorus 2X]

[Interlude: Lounge Lo (Hue Hefna)]
Aiyo, Hef, they told me E.S.G. rock, man
Uh-huh (What up, man?) I know what it do
(Fuck with ya boy) It's Beezy Mode, holla at ya peoples

[Hue Hefna]
Yo, I'm a beast in a concrete jungle
You ain't with me, then fuck you
All in the Fam like Archie Bunkle
Make 'em think that the God is humble
'Til I blast ya face, you a disgrace when the larcen touch you
True story, when I see him, he dead
He was maxin' out, how the fuck Mal G in the feds?
Apologize? I'd rather see it in red
Even gangstas cry, still tears drippin' off my head
Rude boy, yardin' off the dread
Turn a regular house party to Night of the Walkin' Dead
Hue Hef never talk to feds
Spit right in a cop's face, nightstick across my head
Fuck Bowen and Officer Wina, get shot with the nina
Niggaz suck like a vaccuum cleaner
Turn a bitch out quick, stop actin', Tina
Pass the skeezer, the Nov' in the blackest Beamer
This is Hue Hef and Beezy Mode, get easy dough
Slide with ya wifey, she a easy ho
On my grind, I don't need to blow
You don't even know, I'm the best with the cleanest flow, nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Lounge Lo (Hue Hefna)]
Yeeaaaaaaaaah maaaaaaaan
Yes my Lord, man
Y'all know what it do, man
I slid with the peoples, man
NahImean? You deal me?
Y'all fuckin' faggots, man
The Rangers, man
General Gemz
K.C., I see you, my dude
You know what it do, pop that Patron, my dude
While I burn this Booga foot right here
Hah! (Step the fuck back! Brrrrrrr...)
Yes, yes, yes...</pre>
