Comin straight rollin hard

[ VERSE 1: MC Peaches ]
The mic's levelled, the record is spinnin
MC Peaches gettin loose and this is only the beginnin
Of my rhyme, when I'm on the mic I don't waste any time
The mic's in my hand, that's why I'm
Sayin hype, dope, def lines to make you stop and think
And never runnin out of breath, no need to take a drink
Lyrical princess on the microphone
Lyrics written by me, so I can say they're my own
Never slowin down, too hard to surrender
Shootin lyrics like a Uzi, but yet so tender
Rhymes like mine, you only read about in myths
I won't say we can do this but catch it on the strength
With this type of MC there's no need to fake moves
Cause a female like me is too sweet to get an attitude
With this rap style that I've chosen
I know I'm def, that's why I'm boastin

Comin straight rollin hard

[ VERSE 2: MC Peaches ]
No need to raise my voice, no need for me to scream
Peaches is holdin in this hip-hop scene
Two words to describe me, sweet and debonnair
Make any guy in the place just stop and stare
Words like mine, they flow smoothly
I like a beat like this cause it soothes me
Some try to take me out but never come close
I just laugh it off and with MoÃ«t I toast
1, 2, 0, 1, Peaches in effect
Had no other choice but to come correct
Knockin competition out the box like a boxer
Full-blooded American, not a rasta
If there ever was a time to get hype it's now
Get up and rejoice to the Peaches sound
Turn up the bass, hype up the treble
But don't touch the mic cause it's already levelled

Comin straight rollin hard

[ VERSE 3: MC Peaches ]
This is the real thing, it is not a sample
People try to hang but they can't handle
What I'm throwin, they can't catch it
They can't comprehend the method
That I'm choosin, I mean that I'm usin
That's why when they battle me they're losin
But when it's over there's no need to riff
Cause if you come off wrong, sweetheart, you get dissed
Comin straight rollin hard just like I oughta
But with feminality I still slaughter
Any MC that think they can cope
Think twice, cause Peaches is no joke
Mellow

Comin straight rollin hard

[ VERSE 4: MC Peaches ]
Yeah, that's how I say my rhymes
And since I'm not in a rush, I just take my time
And let the words flow as they may
I'm not a player, so I don't play
This is not a competition, it's an expedition
Of MC Peaches, so listen
Since I'm the princess I tend to rule
But there's no need to brag, so I show and prove
Never let it be said that I can't scramble
To play me close is like poker, a gamble
With your life or with the title you hold
The cards are dealt, so now it's time to unfold
That I'm the ace is what you need to accept
I grab a mic, say a rhyme, take you out, then step
But then plex, cause MC Peaches is a rebel
Get paid in full and move on to the next level
Wait for my opponent or wait to get confronted
I don't indulge, yo, I don't get blunted
Concrete rhymes, you need a hammer to break it
If the jam sounds def you know Peaches had to make it</pre>
