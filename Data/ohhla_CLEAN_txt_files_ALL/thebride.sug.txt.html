Ahh this is Precious

	Here comes the bride
	Dr. Funken, with the bride

If you're married and you know what it's all about
Let's turn it out, scream it out and shout, sing

	Here comes the bride
	Don't you know that, it's

Hit me
The Lady Precious Funk is here
The bride of the funk so have no fear
Commiting myself to the funk for life
That's why they call me your funk Precious wife
The captain and the crew gave me away
They told me that the funk would never stray
I gotta keep the funk movin on and on
I'm Precious Funk, on your microphone!

	Here comes the bride
	Dr. Funken, with the bride

I'm married to the funk without a doubt
Everybody in the place say turn it out!
(Turn it out!)
	Here comes the bride
	Don't you know that, it's

To all you mothers standin out there
You got to give up the funk, get up out your chair
Because I am the bridge and that's a fact
I'm on a groove so smooth and so laid back
I'm gonna take the time, to talk to you
About somethin old, but oh so new
You see marriage to me is like thick and thin
A promise forever, that could never end
Ain't nothin in the world like a menu sale
to what we call lovin not nothin else
They've been doin this ever since Adam and Eve
They've been doin this, for centuries!

	Here comes the bride
	Dr. Funken, with the bride
		Here comes the bride
		Dr. Funken, with the bride
	Here comes the bride
	Don't you know that, it's

Get myself somethin
to hold onto
Call it funk music
and here's a little funk, just for you

Ah if a man wants me to be his wife
He better think about it first cause I'm talkin bout life
You see I'm talkin bout the good things with the bad
You see I'm talkin bout happiness with the sad
You see I'm talkin bout a thing called tender lovin care
A man not a mouse who will always be there
Someone that I can be all my life around
To keep me up, and never let me down

	The Doctor and Precious Funk got married
Y'all know what I'm talkin about?
	A microphone and bass for life they carry
	The Doctor and Precious stay together
	Love livin and makin funk for-ever
	The Doctor and Precious Funk got married
	A microphone and bass for life they carry
	The Doctor and Precious stay together
	Love livin and makin funk for-ever

Get myself somethin
to hold onto
Call it funk music
And here's a little funk, just for you
(repeat 2X)

	Here comes the bride
	Dr. Funken, with the bride
		Here comes the bride
		Dr. Funken, with the bridge
	Here comes the bride
	Don't you know that, it's

I'm Blondie, world's precious ride
Don't take no stuff I got my pride
A man marry me he got to be nice
A girl like me don't come by twice
Dr. Funk, say you want me
Too hot to trot, I'm Blondie
Just sittin on the funk and ridin on the groove
Dr. Funk, you're so damn cool

I married the funk, so I could never be alone
The music, the voices, and the microphone
The stagelights, and the fancy cars
is a matrimony for superstars
The Doctor asked me to be his girl
so he could groove provides, and rock my world
Don't give me up, and don't turn me loose
Cause I'm Angie B I got all the juice

Got myself somethin
to hold onto
Call it funk music
And here's a little funk, just for you

	Here comes the bride
	Dr. Funken, with the bride

	Here comes the bride
	Don't you know that, it's

	The Doctor and Precious Funk got married
	A microphone and bass for life they carry
	The Doctor and Precious stay together
	Love livin and makin funk forever
