[Verse 1]
Black cloud its pearl harbor, back down its pure horror 
Clap rounds and hurl mortars          	
World darker, have frown, the sure
Archer, smack clowns, restore order			
Thoughts wise, I stalk, stride, assault spies 
And toss mines, cross line, it's wartime 	 
Creep and slash, beat and bash
Releasing wrath on your chief of staff		
I'm worse than a ghost, insurgent who search 
And approach, you nervous deserted your post		
Immersed in a cloak, you earthlings are burning
And smoked, the curse grim, it's curtains for folks		
I'm the molotovs used in nam, I'll 
Barrage bruise and  harm, in camouflaged uniform		
Roll with the arm forces, lone ninja bomb 
Fortress, so sick the bars nauseous		
Government issued hoovering missiles
Rumbling, troubled men, pummeled when fists flew	
Summoned ninjitsu, the wars begun
Tough as a pitbull, in gory slums			
In gloomy perimeter, it's Spooky and sinister	
I truly will finish ya 
Brute force, pain, I will sever satan
Troops lost, slain in a desert wasteland 	

[Verse 2]
Adjust the scope on the rifle, it's stainless steel
There wasn't hope for survival, aim to kill			
Training drills, the seargeant is harsh
With the whip bombarding the squadron and clique   	
You're clobbered and flipped, no dodging, your armor
Is hit you ponder your option to quit		
a harm and a risk, a cause for concern
I'm armed and equipped, you all gonna learn		
You crawl then squirm, and you lay in the foxhole
The brawler will scourge, I'm a slayer, I'm hostile	
Brazen and watchful, amazing, your haven 
Is toppled my patience is vacant I'm harmful		
Boost morale, on the call of duty
Ruthless, wild, strong with morbid cruelty	
Load aim hold trigger, foes 
Maimed, code name lone ninja</pre>
