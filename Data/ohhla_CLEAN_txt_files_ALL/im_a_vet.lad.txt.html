[Intro: La the Darkman]
Yeah... you know?
Sometimes man, you just gotta make it
Do what you do
It's that nigga La, man, you know?
And it's like...
When I fuckin' step in the booth, you know?
I try to break a motherfuckin' neck
You know I'm sayin'?
Yeah...

[La the Darkman]
I used to run with niggaz that I'm better than
No longer a rookie, I'm a veteran
Police knockin' at the door, never let 'em in
For this crack or this weed I'm peddlin'
Stay wrapped like a mummy cuz all my fiends love me
I'm still a Killa Bee but my honey is my money
And ain't a damn thing funny when that cash ain't correct
Nigga short me on my numbers, I'm a break a nigga neck
Hit his ass with the tech like he over in Quebec
Sing Sing is the gang and you better show respect
I'm a motherfuckin' threat to the whole industry
Cuz there ain't a nigga rappin' that's better than me
Call me L.A.D., short for La the Darkman
On the street, I'm worth about two hundred grand
I do what I want, you niggaz do what you can
You a fan, matter of fact you damn near Stan
So ya huffin' and ya bluffin', it don't really mean nothin'
If I don't like a nigga, nigga I'ma do somethin'
No frontin', no stuntin', only gat head buttin'
People always know me but I tell 'em that it wasn't
How 'bout that? Wanna point the finger at the cat?
But they can't identify me, I'm black in all black
Straight like that, nigga I'm hard to the core
And most you rap niggaz ain't shit but CB4
Lyin' ass niggaz, never seen a brick before
And never went to war with another click before
When them shells fly niggaz die
People mourn, mamas cry
Look into the sky and they ask God "Why?"
I'ma tell you why, drugs, money or these broads
Nine times out of ten, one of them the cause
In the hood it's understood, still alive, knock on wood
Never believe what they tell you nigga, shit ain't all good
They'll peal ya cap backwards, these niggaz is actors
Every chance I get I'ma stick 'em like a cactus
That's law I practice, tellin' you what the facts is
Run up in ya house and get the money out ya mattress
Nigga...</pre>
