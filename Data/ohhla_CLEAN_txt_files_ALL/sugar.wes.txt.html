	(Sugar, sugar, sugar) ( 4x ) 

	It's like a hot fudge drippin down 
	Drippin down, drippin
	You got me trippin
	I'm almost slippin
	Genuine, one of a kind
	Brown

	(Sugar, sugar, sugar)

[ VERSE 1 ]
As I walk into the room, it's easy to assume
A brother like me loves the girls with a boom
Coolin with my fellas, talkin how we makin ends 
Walkin through the 'valley of the skins' like my nigga Trendz
Seen a hot dame, I had to kick game
Not a regular type of hottie I be seein on the train
Voluptous, I was presumtuous
So I had to step up, step up, step up to this
She said, "You can't handle this
I'm livin far from scandalous
I don't drink beers, don't smoke cannabis
Don't need a man for shit 
I'm an independent chick
Salt-N-Pepa type of heffa, yeah, I'm on my own dick
Never actin pompous, I'm strictly conscious
Got goals in life that I'm tryin to accomplish
A real good looker, far from a hooker
My first name's Brown and my last name is Sugar"

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
You shoulda seen it, hops, she raised my eyebrows
The way the titties went bang and that ass went pow
She said, "My hair's always done, nails always polished
Got knowledge, plus I go to a all-girl college"
I had to step in and started tellin her
"Baby look, all-girl college pussy ain't no better than the regular"
( Laughter ) She started laughin and said I was cute
But I ain't cute, you're cute with that skin-tight suit
You see what I'm sayin, I wasn't sweatin her
But my game was on point cause I was gettin her
Wettin her, lettin her
Check me out with her retina
Scopin that ass just like a predator
She said, "Wes, you're a real cool brother
Damn, why didn't I met you earlier this summer?"
I asked why, she said, "You got mad flavs
But I'm goin back to college and I leave in two days
But don't get me wrong, word to my moms
I'll be back for Thanksgiving, so you know I put you on"
You know I had a front like I was chillin
But deep down inside "Let's hit in now, money, fuck Thanksgiving"
I said, "Baby doll, don't play 
You know a brother like me gives thanks every day"
She said, "Don't even try it, I'm far from a hooker 
My first name's Brown and my last name is Sugar

[ CHORUS ]

	No additives, no preservatives 
	Strictly 
	(Sugar, sugar, sugar)
	A granulated, often imitated, never duplicated brown
	(Sugar, sugar, sugar)
	No saccharin, no equal or sequel
	(Sugar, sugar, sugar)
	A granulated, often imitated, never duplicated brown
	(Sugar, sugar, sugar)
	That's right

[ VERSE 3 ]
She said, "Wes, don't look at me as just sexual
I mean, I know I look good, but shit, I'm also intellectual
I caught ya peepin my behind
But we got so much in common, let our minds intwine"
"I hear what you're sayin," is what I told her
"And it seems like you got a good head on your shoulders
And yeah, I must admit that your style's slick
But fuck that Janet-Jackson-Let's-Wait-A-While shit"
She said, "The more we talk, the more I'm with this
But don't get me mixed up with all these other bitches
I just met you, I ain't with it, but I'll admit it
When I come back I might let you hit it
I can't play myself and look soft
Cause in 1994 you know I'm comin off
I got my act down pat, proud of bein black
Don't need a nigga for jack, and my pockets stay fat
A real good looker, far from a hooker
My first name's Brown and my last name's Sugar"
