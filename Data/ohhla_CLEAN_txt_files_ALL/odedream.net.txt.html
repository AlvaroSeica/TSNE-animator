[Kilo Kish]
I see you, I see what I need
Upside down cause it's not how it seems
Intricacies, making believe
Your diary, is inside of me
Come fly with me, way down below
and scream silently, in the undertows
It's society, that makes it hard to sleep
I close my eyes, but I still see - the fire

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I know that I'll never forget you girl {*3X*}
cause I see you in my dreams

[Kilo Kish]
It's hard to tell whether or not I wanna know
I'm thinkin all the time and I guess it shows
It's tough for us to go back in time
to the night before, everything was fine
When you talked to me, and I talked to you
We watched pedophiles, on the morning news
And the water dripped, from my faucet top
If I collect it all, could we get it back? Please

[Chorus]

[Kilo Kish: repeat 2X]
Baby, will you
Forget a-bout me
You're at the front of mind
Sitting behind my eyes all the time

[Chorus]

[repeat to end, distorted and reinterpreted]
Will you mistake me for another one? </pre>
