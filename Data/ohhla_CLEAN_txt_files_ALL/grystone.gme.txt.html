[The Game]
Wake up in the mornin feelin like a G
Got them #4's on my feet
And the Lakers just beat the Heat
Clippers beat the Knicks, think it's 'bout to be a good week!
Yeah I'm rich forever - you know I got them good seats
Now let's hit up Greystone, get our fuckin Ace on
Know I'm in the V.I.P., throwin back straight 'tron
Goons with me case we gotta get our fuckin ape on
Nigga playin Superman, better have that cape on
My niggaz pop up outta nowhere, State Farm
But I'm coolin orator, play them Drake songs
And brin it back to the Westside, play them Ace songs
Cause lil' momma know, we only in here for one night
... a week doe
And watch out for them wolves, dressed up in them sheep clothes
She don't really club, but I bet that ass a freak though

[Chorus: Sam Hook] + (The Game)
We're only in here for one night (a week doe)
We're only in here for one night (I said a week doe)
It go one shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron, nigga... we on
It go one shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron, nigga...
We gon' have a champagne shower~!

[Fat Joe]
Round of applause; baby make that ass clap
You know your man he a fraud I gotta have that
She want a bodyguard, I'll be her New Edition
She pray for Louboutins, must be her true religion
Now I'm lookin for Taraji and somebody with a body like China
China? The one from King of Diamonds who designed her
I call her Barbie, pink Ferraris on her birthday
And I'ma make sure every day is like the first day
She want another round, fuck her to another round
I don't just beat the pussy, I runs it to the ground
Every day another girl and another town
I don't just beat the pussy, I runs it to the ground

[Chorus]

[Young Chris]
California baby! Yeah (whattup)
Sunday night Greystone, neck full of gray stones
Starin at the crowd tryin to see who I'ma take home
Game said "straight 'tron," I be on that champagne
Bitches all around us tryin to watch us do the damn thang
Shouts out to Joey Crack, chicks like "Oh he back"
Welcome to my house party, O.G., roll it back
Blow it if he showin that, keep a few loaded gats
Bitch niggaz showin out, real niggaz notice that
California lifestyle, fuckin with my nigga Chuck
Jackpot and steak shit, Young Chris, nigga what
All we know is get to it, stack high, live it up
Fuckin with that Greystone, everybody get 'em up
Yeah!!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now get 'em up {*2X*}
Where them bottles at?
Where them waittresses, where them models at?
Tell 'em bring in some more 'tron
And if you from outta town, welcome to Greystone
Greystone~! ... Welcome to Greystone, Greystone!</pre>
