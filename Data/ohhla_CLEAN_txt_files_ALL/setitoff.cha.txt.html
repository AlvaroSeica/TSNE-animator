[Chamillionaire]
Off that drank color-color changin' anaconda man
Ice bright as a night light or whiter then Madonna's hand
Oops! I did it again, jewlrey man give him a grand
Man chain changin' colors like a man gettin' a tan
I ain't no stupid..Jim Carrey
Heat..Koopa will carry
Knock ya out til' you fall asleep wit' missin' teeth like a tooth fairy
Worry weekend..to scary to compete wit the red dot
Red-Dot?, what red-dot? the red-dot on ya head, pop
Ya girl on Reg' jock
Top off of Regs' drop
Ladies call me Barney Rubble because I make the Bed Rock
Before you realize that you was supposed to move over
DJ Bull already changed his name to DJ BullDozer
Chamillion is the tidas but that boy ain't from Zalidas
I'm the cause for her jaws like with mouth of gingivitis
He prolly talkin' down but the reason they wanna fight us
The pokin' wit 4 rims we became employers at Midas</pre>
