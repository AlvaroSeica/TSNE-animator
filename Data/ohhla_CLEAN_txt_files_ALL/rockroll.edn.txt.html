[Dagha]
I be the headbanger with the double-edge razor
The breathtaker, dragon slayer slash savior
Assassinator, flame thrower, fascinator
My dagger blade cascade, and catch the mayor
Captivator, spectator, activator
Palladium's packed, they pay me a stacks of paper
Aggravated assault, halt the batch of strangers
The strangler, long ranger, the devil devestator
Educated rebel with the heavy metal flavor
Levels is elevated to decibels of danger
Volts from that generator blow the detonator
Decimate the place and left the radius a crater
I cater to the greater entertainer
and blaze the remainder with the energy of anger
Celebrate the maker, I mutilate later
And play a naysayer like a amplified bass player

[Edan]
The Riders of the Storm enter when Doors open
To bring raw dosage in the form of swarm locusts
Beatles and Birds that seem evil and absurd
Gather with The Eagles that swerve to form herds
Butterflies made of Iron ride the horizon
Giving Credence to the Revival of Poseidon
Who feeds in the Clearwater, you feel slaughter
But Lovecraft author pens the horror for tomorrow
Zombies and walking dead stalk the Talking Heads
Insects with awkward legs haunt with awful dread
All along the web the thread remains rare
With bloodshed that led to where the Little Feat fled
To lost places, thoughts lost for all ages
Where Small Faces sit on the walls of tall Mazes
That overlook the 13th Floor with long gazes
Connected to the earthly core through elevators
Check it, the Underground is made of Velvet
Where buttersoft brothers talk tough on wax but ain't sell shit
Every cracka that rap, ain't the Elvis
My Aqualung cultivates the blue oyster shellfish
I design my Pearls Before Swine
And form rhymes that take you to a world before time
Where Living Things coexisted with Crimson Kings
Who on the Moon's Dark Side painted pretty things
That illustrated lessons conceived by the mothers of invention
Who also built the Stairway To Heaven, it's a present
Only to be stolen by a Thief, the Judas Preist
Who unleash his devil magic
My mental fabric too thick for Lenny Kravitz
Who imitates Jimi Hendrix in every facette
Semi-Automatic Rap Heavy Metal Jackets
Kill with mathematics to build with Black Sabbath</pre>
