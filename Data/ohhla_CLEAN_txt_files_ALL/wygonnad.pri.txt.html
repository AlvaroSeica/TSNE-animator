Nooooow
This is trouble, get back in the bubble
I'm gonna fix you up fast, on the double
I'll make the rest recover, but no one can discover
The problems that I have and that I never tell the others
What, you contemplating
Complaining, after all my training
What's the matter wit' you clones
Did I not give Dolly a piece of the right bone
Maybe I was better doing it alone
And y'all better get gone, my temper's blown
All of you out of my face, wastin' my space
My time, go write some rhymes
Hooks and lines and sinker
I wish I had a better machine to make me richer
Get the picture, I'm gonna take a nap
Get the fuck out my face, you make me feel like crap

What you gonna do when I come for you, ha, ha, ha, ha
What you gonna do when I come for you, ha, ha, ha, ha
What you gonna do when I come for you, ha, ha, ha, ha
What you gonna do when I come for you, ha, ha, ha, ha

Ssh, Duplicant CC20 come here
I think the Superstar's asleep, it's all clear
I heard there was a machine that could make us happy
Ssh, don't wake her up, she's napping!
I can't stand being her slave!
Me too, but I'm afraid
Maybe there's a machine that could change us
Make us happy, make us unfamous
Make us into a whole person again
Make us have some real feelings again
But if there's not then we could pretend
Fantasise till we do our celebrity work again
Oh great, I think the Superstar's awake
Don't let her see us takin' a break
Pretend you're studying your lines for that role
Weren't you every single actor on that show?
And anyway, I gotta go to Broadway
We just took over all the plays
It's ok, I'm gonna fantasise about that machine
The Superstar's so mean!

What you gonna do when I come for you, ha, ha, ha, ha
What you gonna do when I come for you, ha, ha, ha, ha
What you gonna do when I come for you, ha, ha, ha, ha
What you gonna do when I come for you, ha, ha, ha, ha</pre>
