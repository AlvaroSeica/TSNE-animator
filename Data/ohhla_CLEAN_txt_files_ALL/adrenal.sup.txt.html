[Intro]
Welcome ladies and gentlemen. I'd now like to introduce you to Supastition. 
There's a few things he'd like to say. So y'all listen up.

[Verse One]
You wanna make beats with Supa? Don't gamble with your life
The only time I shake hands is when I'm handling the dice
You're amateur compared to what I write
(Man, let it go)
I beat the dead horse like I don't care for animal rights
May lightening strike a nigga down if I'm frontin'
They tryin' to decide if I sold more records or rewind buttons
I rock a show but after you pay me I'm bouncin'
If not
I'm as negative as shady accountants
Hip hop
I love it but I've been through hell
Therefore my price never goes down like Technique 12's
I got a fan base that expands past American landscapes
You don't understand the point? Let me translate
I go beyond your block radius
A perfectionist
Every single joint I record is on my greatest hits
Dated back to '86, I've been the boss
Now Supastition is the most hated thing on paper since The Source
Ask your girl I get around
Fuck Prada boots
The way she keep her ass out, I buy her hospital gowns
Niggas want the crown but it stays in place
Until then, there won't be no singing +Amazing Grace+
I flow dolo
But don't sleep, I got a brigade
As far as testin' us?
Any day is not a good day
Now other crews begin to fade
But my colony stays
So do your thing, I'll do mine, stay the fuck outta my way

[Chorus]
I want it live in the front, if you don't wanna get stomped
You should back up
Right now, this is how we act up
Huh? What?
I got the whole place jumpin' like
Huh? What?
Feel the adrenaline
I want it live in the front, if you don't wanna get stomped
You should back up
North, south, east, west act up
Huh? What?
I got the whole place rockin' like
Huh? What?
Feel the adrenaline

[Verse Two]
You can't touch the unorthodox flow
You better off tryin' to buyin' cocaine on the street wearin' cop clothes
This is my destine I
Test me why?
Use your recordings against you like the F.B.I.
So it can and it will be forever held against you
But in the meantime you better practice self defense moves
I spit like I never have a second chance
To the streets I'm bout to leak like cheap breast implants
I know other ways to say that you wack
I call you from your crib, fuckin' your girl with your CD playin' in the back
You diss me for the sake of makin' songs
One look, your ladies gone
At my spot, naked makin' 80's porn
Y'all lames don't perform nowhere
Me? I'll spin the globe and the place that it stops, I do a show there
So oh yeah
This here's a nice introduction
I'm a starving artist with an appetite for destruction
Over the right production I'm damn near invincible
And any non believers should be thrown in an institute
Freestyle or written, y'all done seen what I do to crabs
Each style I'm spittin' ridiculous, you can do the math
If it gets serious or critical you know
I David Ruffin niggas pop up in the middle of your show
Now some claim to be the greatest
But can you back those words?
I think you a thing of the past like black chauffeurs 
And that's my word

[Chorus]
I want it live in the front, if you don't wanna get stomped
You should back up
Right now, this is how we act up
Huh? What?
I got the whole place jumpin' like
Huh? What?
Feel the adrenaline
I want it live in the front, if you don't wanna get stomped
You should back up
North, south, east, west act up
Huh? What?
I got the whole place rockin' like
Huh? What?
Feel the adrenaline
Like Huh? What?
(Keep it goin')
C'mon, huh? What?
Huh? What?
Keep it goin' like
Huh? What?
Supastition

[Outro]
Make your head bop to it</pre>
