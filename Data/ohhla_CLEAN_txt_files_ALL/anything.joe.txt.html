So
So cold

[Chorus - Joe Budden] - w/ ad libs
We could do what we wanna, it's an all night bash
Put the pedal to the metal and crash
Here anything goes (goes, goes)
Anything goes (goes)

We could party how we wanna, get drunk with hoes
Strip poker 'til we run out of clothes
Here anything goes (goes, goes)
Anything goes (goes)

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Here we go! Welcome to my world where anything goes
Here you can ball out of control
While you here, you can flourish, you can shop, go cop more shit
Like never mind a car note, a mortgage (I mean)
Here's no such thing as a hooptie
We could fuck tonight, (niggaz won't) and they won't call you a groupie
Bumpin Stevie Wonder +Do I Do+
With +Bad Bitches+ (I mean a), I guess I got a 2 Live Crew (oh!)
And they all carry Mossbergs
See we ain't New Kids on the Block, you can leave that shit for Donnie Wahlberg
The world is mine, I ain't got a care livin (nigga)
I'm gifted, I watch sounds and hear visions (but if)
At one call I can have you disappear missin
Rearrange your features so you appear different
But nah, nobody gon' die tonight, that's a restriction
When you doin this much livin

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden]
Look, welcome to my world where anything goes
So you could cry all you want to, lie all you want to
You can get high, puff lye all you want to
As long as you don't hold that shit hostage (nah)
We all V.I.P., open bar mami
Got fake breasts, no bra, no regard (she)
She cool with the m√©nage
That takes place when you act like TMZ, I just shoot for the stars
I'm so "fuck it", I board the plane lookin low budget (nigga)
No carry on, no luggage
Low bucket, I'm headed to the south side
Baby is free base, she wanna join the mile high
Fellatio expert (what that mean?), that means mouth wide
That shit be feelin better than formaldehyde (but)
But nah, we don't need the dust right now in our rotation
That's just gon' fuck up our celebration, ya heard?

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Joe Budden]
Uh, welcome to my world where anything goes
So you can stack up, invest, live off the interest
Get ya money right
Play the couch with ya hand on ya balls, welcome to Al Bundy life (I mean)
Home on bed rest, waitin on my next check
I'm just plottin my next step and my next breath (oh)
If you don't do that in excess (there's really no)
There's no point, like TV's in the backseats' headrest (oh!)
Some niggaz get spiteful or angry
Some niggaz are prideful and it pains me (let's go)
Our brain speed ain't at the same speed
So I ain't mad, don't blame y'all, I blame me (nigga, I blame me)
Put a wall in my path, I'm just gonna knock it down or go through it
Before you try to knock that down, go through it
Try it or go do it
The folk in my world won't look at you so stupid</pre>
