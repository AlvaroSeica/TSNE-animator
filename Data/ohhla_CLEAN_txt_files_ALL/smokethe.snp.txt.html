[Intro: Collie Buddz]
You know!

[Chorus: Snoop Lion]
Smoke the weed (Everyday) Don't smoke the seed (No way!)
Smoke the weed (Hey!) Smoke the weed

[Verse One: Snoop Lion]
Younger generation! Young gents and girls
Be careful of the seeds you show
If yuh waan fi see a strong tree grow
You got to prepare for the future
Show respect don't neglect mother nature
All the polution in this world, mi just cyaan stand it
Global warnin mek di whole world panic
Take care of mother earth 'cause a she be di planet
Yute man don't go a stray!
Fresh trees young seeds all try to find a light
Stretchin out their limbs to di sun, guide dem right
Help dem keep their life and Jah watch over like a satellite
Tell dem when to stop and go like a traffic light
Many obstacles to overcome in di city life
Makin sure they stay pure teach dem what's wrong from right
Seed brings forth new light!!!!!!!!

[Chorus: Snoop Lion]
Smoke the weed (Everyday) Don't smoke the seed (No way!)
Smoke the weed (Hey!) Smoke the weed

[Chorus: Snoop Lion]
Smoke the weed (Everyday) Don't smoke the seed (No way!)
Smoke the weed (Hey!) Smoke the weed

[Verse Three: Snoop Lion] (Collie Buddz)
Burn like propa, yute dem a suffa
Dance dem a pop off hot like di summa
You can never understand why we live to light
You will never recognize, 'til if you see the fire in my eyes
I'm buryin a man, like every single day
Black birds in the sky, then get out my, way
The smoke is my gun that's how I blow them away
Music is my weapon, rewind and let it play
Babylon to Belize, down south, the whole bay
They call me Snoop Lion I smoke everyday (You know) 
Weed keep plantin, these seeds
Watch them grow up, new breed
Cultivatin, these trees
The cycle carries on
And on and on and on it don't stop
The tick top of the universal clock
To the bang bang boogie with the light streamin through me
And it flows that way while we procreate

[Chorus: Snoop Lion]
Smoke the weed (Everyday) Don't smoke the seed (No way!)
Smoke the weed (Hey!) Smoke the weed
