[Chorus]
I-B-N in the wind
Them bustas gotta check it in
I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind
I-B-N in the wind, them dividends I'm gettin' em in
I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind,
I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind
Them bustas gotta check it in

[1st Verse]
I-B-N gonna handle this
I-B-N gonna pimp and spit
I-B-N the midst of doja everywhere I choose to sit
I-B-N to making loot
I-B-N a solo group
I-B-N surpassing or harassing playahation troops
I-B-N to charging thangs
I-B-N to money main
I-B-N to loco jokers hoping that Lil' Ibn change
I-B-N for taking over
I-B-N will run you over
I-B-N will drain you for your high and leave your body sober
I-B-N the S.P.V
I-B-N the city streets
I-B-N the country funk, bumpin out this industry
I-B-N and out again
I-B-N to cheffein wind
I-B-N wake up in the early morning till the dizay ends
I-B-N a players mode
I-B-N to win the gold
I-B-N in the cut with gangsta weeze and you dont even know
I-B-N gonna wrap it up
I-B-N gonna strut my stuff
I-B-N in the wind without a friend
And keep them mega bucks

[Chorus]
I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind
I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind
Them bustas gotta check it in
I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind,
I-B-N, in the wind
them dividends I'm gettin' em in

I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N I-B-N 
I-B-N in the wind, them dividends I'm gettin' em in
I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind,
I-B-N, in the wind
Them bustas gotta check it in

[2nd Verse]
I-B-N my second verse
I-B-N wont even curse
I-B-N to making suckers suffer till they reach a hurst
I-B-N your banking book
I-B-N your pocketbook
I-B-N on money making motions like a roguish crook
I-B-N-dependant though
I-B-N professional
I-B-N to appearing and pursuing the material
I-B-N complete control
I-B-N where young and old
I-B-N to music, and I use it most to soothe my soul
I-B-N to psycho track
I-B-N from back to back
I-B-N to twist one mega blunt up out a chronic sack
I-B-N the Lawnview Gardens
I-B-N the Lil Pookie Apartment
I-B-N on green leaves, and asleep before the party starts
Ib entertaining Fly
I-B-N gonna keep me high
I-B-N in God I trust
And Minnie Mae must never lie
I-B-N the 15th bar
I-B-N the stall you see
I-B-N it for a couple minutes then the chorus creeps

[Chorus]
I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind
I-B-N, in the wind
them dividends I'm gettin' em in
I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind,
I-B-N, in the wind 
Them bustas gotta check it in

I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind 
I-B-N in the wind, them dividends I'm gettin' em in
I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind,
I-B-N, in the wind
Them bustas gotta check it in

[3rd Verse]
I-B-N gonna turn it out
I-B-N gonna scream and shout
I-B-N untill the end, and always claim the dirty south
I-B-N on mighty white, have me in the dark and light
I-B-N a group that make you move when Flizy rock the mic
I-B-N been underground
I-B-N now hurts the town
I-B-N the worst, and yo it hurts, but flame wont keep me down
I-B-N the Minnie Mae
I-B-N all in your face
I-B-N disgusted with this bunch of playerhation race
IB Influential too
I-B-N the buckest crew
I-B-N important so just sit and wait till Fly get through
I-B-N the house to stay
I-B-N know not to play
I-B-N wont grin, but quickly send a busta on his way
I-B-N on power flour
I-B-N on power powder
I-B-N devour all you lemons leaning like a tower
I-B-N because of trend
I-B-N has reached the end
I-B-N is in the wind for dividends so check em in

[Chorus]
I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind
I-B-N, in the wind
them dividends I'm gettin' em in
I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind,
I-B-N, in the wind 
Them bustas gotta check it in

I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind 
I-B-N in the wind, them dividends I'm gettin' em in
I-B-N, I-B-N, I-B-N in the wind,
I-B-N, in the wind
Them bustas gotta check it in</pre>
