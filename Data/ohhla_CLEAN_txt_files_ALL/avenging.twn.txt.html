[Lone Ninja]
Beyond the Dark Portal we strong and not mortal
Forceful, thee aura's not normal        
Tunnel cave is black rumble, raid attack
Hunt the prey they runaway from double bladed axe       
Pummel, break your back the floating ghost ninja
The trouble maker scraps opponents choked, injured    
Driven by the desire for vengeance,
The villain who's obliging your death wish    
More than upset, haunt the suspect
Til they brought to justice    
Evil lurks and harasses the villagers
People cursed at the hands of the sinister   
White burial kimono knife's tearing
Through your throat slow strike fear into the bold foe
There's hollers, when the sun's heat emits
Demolish, we're the unleashed spirits            

[June Marx]
Napalm and Gas, unfurl in your forecast
Murderous whirlwinds turbulent storms pass
Cardinal Marx, servicing Gods wrath
Bombs strapped, insurgents on a warpath
Warcraft, descendant of avenging soul
Assassin, lay low, play a peasants role
Devils stole, relics and the temple scroll
Perils know, bredrin you will perish slow
Metal fold, melt whole metropolis
Flesh glow ominous, theres no stoppin this
There are no promises,
Let the tears flow, spare no hostages
Fearful operas, foreign intelligence
Sovereign, ride aboard armored elephants
Stomp thru forts and settlements
Psalms and testaments
Its evident, war and pestilence, Marx</pre>
