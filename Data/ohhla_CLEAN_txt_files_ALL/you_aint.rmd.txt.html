Typed by: Cno Evil

[Hook 2X: samples]
Everyday I'm hustin'
I'm a hustler, homey
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm hustlin'
I'm a, I'm a hustler, homey

[Chorus: Remedy]
You ain't a hustler, everything you gets on my arm
You ain't a hustler, you ain't a hustler
You ain't a hustler, f you broke, live at home with your mom
You ain't a hustler, you ain't a hustler
You ain't a hustler, getting high on your supply
You ain't a hustler, you ain't a hustler
You ain't a hustler, if you ain't really ready to die
You ain't a hustler, you ain't a hustler

[Remedy]
Got some pounds, broke 'em down, what you think, you hustling now?
Feel your script, make a flip, think you got some muscle, now?
Couple grands, selling grams, you ain't got that hustle down
Here and there, back and forth, you be running out of town
You say you hustling, but you ain't got the money for bail
So what you hustling for, so you can go to jail
Or you can go and tell, then you can go to hell
And you can work for the cops, and you can buy and sell
You say you're this and that, jack of spades with many hats
I hear you talking that, but what you are is a potential rat
You ain't big deal, you're food in someone's meal
Why can't you keep it real, you're on Achilles heel
You ain't no breadwinner, more like chicken dinner
Just an evil sinner, rookie, younging, new beginner
Don't know how to earn, you, you'll never learn
You'll probably crash and burn, quick to flip, singing turns

[Chorus]
