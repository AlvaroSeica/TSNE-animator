[A.G.]
I might be dingy and (dirty) but please don't rinse me
Got a +Jones+ like +Quincy+, you sick? Convince me
Wizard of the game, you soft I'll give you some heart
Got chicks that'll give you the brains (OH!)
I'm big dog, you Toto, get lost or force me
to put you in a thong and lip gloss, you homo!
My resurrection is destined, crowned
king of the underground with a dirty infection
Music is a weapon call me desperado
Niggaz feel A from the Bay to West Chicago
Oh, the Henny got me bought a extra bottle
Cause we livin for the moment, can't stress tomorrow
(So what you sayin?) Follow my heart it's a part of my makeup
Worth more than my drop, and the watch from Jacob
That's why the girls say yes
And M and Don Tess couldn't count the ladies I undress

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna fuck with us? (I don't think so)
Cause if you did I'll send niggaz to touch you up
And ask yourself are you brave enough
If you are come through nigga blaze it up (blaze it up)
You really think you ready to die? (I don't think so)
Cause if so I got a 9, wanna give it a try? (C'mon)
And ask yourself are you brave enough
If so come through nigga blaze it up (blaze it up)

[A.G.]
Don't give that nigga no weed - you gon' fuck up his future
Early bird, I get up with the roosters
And my mind's like a fuckin computer (tell 'em man)
Sleepin on me is like fuckin with Kruger
Back to basics, cats I stay with pack razors
But you think that's to shave with
NAH~! That's for the permanent facelifts
My shit tight, I ball like I ran with Naismith
With a padre on the yacht, not from San Diego
Better be a pot at the end of this rainbow (or what?)
A thousand watts and watch your brains blow
And niggaz pitch rocks but they name ain't Pedro
A king from Kemet to a housing tenant (why's that?)
Cause of my race and I ain't talkin 'bout a pennant
Original black man speakin
And I'm with a camp of Puerto Ricans that belong in the precinct

[Chorus]</pre>
