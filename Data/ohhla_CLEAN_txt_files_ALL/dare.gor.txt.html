[Shaun Ryder]
It's coming up...it's coming up...
It's coming up...it's coming up...
It's coming up...it's coming up...
It's DARE (ohh)

[Noodle]
You've got to press it on you
You just think it
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, DARE...
Jump with the moon, and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like yooou were there yourself
Work it ooooout

(auauuuuuuuuuh)

[Chorus - Shaun Ryder]
Never did no HARM, never did no HARM...
It's DARE
It's coming up...it's coming up...
It's coming up...it's coming up...
It's coming up...It's DARE (ohh)

It's DARE

[Noodle]
You've got to press it on you
You just, think it, that's what you do

[Noodle and Shaun Ryder]
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, DARE

[Noodle]
Jump with the moon and move it
Jump back and forth

[Shaun Ryder]
And feel like yoooou were there yourself
Work it oooout


[Chorus - Shaun Ryder]
Never did no HARM, never did no HARM...
It's DARE
It's coming up...it's coming up...
It's coming up...it's coming up...
It's coming up...It's DARE (ohh)


Never did no HARM, never did no HARM...
It's DARE
It's coming up...it's coming up...
It's coming up...it's coming up...
It's coming up...It's DARE (ohh)

[Noodle, then Noodle and Shaun Ryder]
You've got to press it on you
You just, think it, that's what you do
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, DARE
Jump with the moon and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like yoooou were there yourself
Work it out (TAH)
You've got to press it on you
You just, think it, that's what you do
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, DARE
Jump with the moon and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like yoooou were there yourself
Work it ooooout...</mailto:kirenamloh></pre>
