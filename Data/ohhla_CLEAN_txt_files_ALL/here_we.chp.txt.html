Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Sup lonely girl with the expectations way too high
Ever think about why you lonely you should switch it up tonight
You should loosen up tonight
You should be cool don't put up no fight
You should give me some butt tonight
You might as well not give a fuck tonight
Got my niggas in here
Everything on me
But we all got bread
Young boss young gee
Got a cold young bitch
She got a brand new whip
Vallet back to back
Black on black
Racks on Chip

[Chorus]
Celebrate wakin' up today
Dog I don't give a fuck what they say
All them niggas broke anyway
We extra good we [?]
Today just ain't yo day
Go to sleep try again tomorrow
I now you don't see us much but tonight you lucked up here we are
Here we are
Yeah here we here
Hope you got your good clothes on
I know you heard we was gon' be here
Here we are
Here we here
Ghetto superstar
Bitch, quit playin' come here

[Verse 2]
See you lookin'
Here I am
Girl you better come choose me
You don't wanna need a man
Don't be on them games
I'm too fresh quit playin'
Come bob your head in my lap do the best you can
Niggas hatin' in here
We don't care
They girls with us
They ain't allowed up here
Captain keep it real with a bitch
Have no fear
Ay girl come and try this
Please put down that beer

[Chorus]
Celebrate wakin' up today
Dog I don't give a fuck what they say
All them niggas broke anyway
We extra good we [?]
Today just ain't yo day
Go to sleep try again tomorrow
I now you don't see us much but tonight you lucked up here we are
Here we are
Yeah here we here
Hope you got your good clothes on
I know you heard we was gon' be here
Here we are
Here we here
Ghetto superstar
Bitch, quit playin' come here</pre>
