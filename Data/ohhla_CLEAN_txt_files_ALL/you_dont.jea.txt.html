This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Just another girl who chose a different path
[Slick Rick scratching]
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Just another girl who chose a different path

[Slick Rick scratching]

Jeannie! Jeannie
I hear 'em screamin'; want me back (oh)
I thought you didn't believe in me, I was whack (oh)
You want the in-between Fellini, white and black (um)
Well I don't know I feel a way about your ac-tions
What can you offer me?
Apologies? Security? Amazing publicity? 
Or cult status obscurity?
Cause I do nothing for the purity, the "love"
Get the fuck on with that, this ain't nothing but maturity
Don't go get your white gloves to deal with it
Grown-ass woman who's no prone to fearin' shit
Piss up in your snow cone Jackass, so here's a tip:
Don't eat the Grae snow
Go fix your face, bro
I swing my mace low, I don't mean mace no
Gogo Yubari that crazy 88 flow
No folks, your army brats made in a place so I'm really not afraid of them
I'm Project Mayhem
I'm complex, based on abominable case study
Based on phenomenon in Space Buddy
Take that, take that  Diddy
In yo face  Eddie
Turn the lights off  Teddy
You are not a beautiful snowflake, Chuck
When the going gets weird the weird turn pro, Hunt
If we gonna use quotes then step your quote game up
Hit the sample Hit Girl, "ok, you cunts"
 
[Refrain]
You don't like it, so what [Repeat 4x]
You don't like it, so what I don't care 

I'm like Judy Blume with uzi's
You're like Jacques Cousteau exploring in jacuzzis
Oh, wow! You really got deep there
Three feet, woah, what a fuckin' reach, yeah
OMG can you even come back up for air?
ROTFLMAO, no one really cares
I'm at Waffle House, deep picking Cher "Do You Believe"
On the jukebox and dancing on a chair
My sleeves rolled up, I don't give a fuck fam
I'm me. So what, me Jeanius, damn
Fire bad, rap good
I'm the entire back row of the class would
You please stop trying to teach me, I'm past it
Advanced Regents smashed it
Peed on it Kelly, Kelly, Regis, Justin, Kelly, Kelly, Zacked-it
Might not get it, rewind and get active
I spin spit different (whatever) hipster arachnid
Specifically classics, but consider me average if 
I'm mentioned in public cause you bound to be clowned
For including me in your rap list of the top motherfuckers who ass-kick (uh-huh)
Not that the statement's not accurate (it is)
Just that motherfuckers need to face the facts a bit
Your favorite rapper's favorite rapper, nigga handle it
New York, West Side in the 20s, Chelsey Handler... shit
 
[Refrain]

Loooooorrrd have mercy...
Yep, just wasted four bars there
You don't like it, so what I don't care (nope)
I can afford to waste bars like it's healthcare 
In Amer---oh fuck it, I failed yeah
All hail the prevailing queen of fuckery, yeah
Crown tilted to the side finger fucking the air
Upchucking a beer, leg humpin' a stud
Gun tucked in the rear pocket, duckin' the fuzz
Wait, I don't carry no guns (double negative)</pre>
