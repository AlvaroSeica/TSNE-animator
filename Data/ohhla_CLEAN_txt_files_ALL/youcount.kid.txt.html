"Well, I have known you
Since you were a small boy
And your mama used to say
"Well, my boy is gonna grow up and be some kind of leader
Some day"
Then you turn on the radio
And sing with the singer in the band
Your mama would say to you
"This isn't exactly what
We had planned"
But you're a legend in your own time (You are)
A hero in the footlights (Yeah, yeah)
Playing tunes to fit your rhyme
But a legend's only a lonely boy
When he goes home alone" --&gt; Carly Simon

[Frost]
(Verse 1)
October 15th
The day you were born
I looked into your eyes and saw a star when you were born
In growing up, you used to sit there, watch me and observe
That's always I taught ya
Family comes first
In "La Raza" video, you was right beside me
And now you're number one producer, and you still beside
That's the bond between a father and a son, uh
Cause you always come first, number one, uh
I remember you was young and always on the keys
You would sit there for hours learnin' to make a beat
I knew there come a time, it's in your blood line
I laid the blueprint, you followed my design
Opportunity's on passion, you scooped 'em up
My little lefty little leaguer, but you blew up
Slow down, son, you killin' 'em, you blowin' up
And now you got bigger goals than the world cup

Chorus: Big Tank
You can count on me
Cause I know
Been through it before
Walked the same roads
Everywhere you are, every place you go
Even when I'm gone, my legacy carries on
You can count on me
Cause I know
Been through it before
Walked the same roads
Everywhere you are, every place you go
Even when I'm gone, my legacy carries on
Through, you

(Verse 2)
Two double-0 six, the 4th day of May
Little did I know, my whole world would change
Four months go by, I get the worst call ever
My son's scar fractured, laying on the stretcher
I used to rub his hand to relieve the pressure
Months in the hospital, it felt like forever
I fought for full custody, and I won trial
And you can never tell you're a motherless child
Your smile full of joy, my rhythm, my boy
I never feel lonely, you feel that, boy
Someday, you gon' be a leader, makin' key decisions
And when I'm gone, carry on family tradition

Repeat Chorus Twice
