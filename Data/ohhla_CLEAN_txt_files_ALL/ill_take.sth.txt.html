[A.L.T.]
(Verse 1)
I take you back
In my past, I used to live life fast
And yo
It wasn't shit to let the .38 blast
I had it goin'
On, with the bitches and hoes, too
Yo, come to think about it, so did my whole crew
We bumped the old school jams from the East Coast
We was the baddest Mexicans outta East Los
Back in the days, many crews got hushed
It seems
Every night, me and my homies got
Rushed
But
We never back down, even if we got beat down
We came back next week to the same town
And we was ready for 'em
But they still figure
That they could do us
So tiny pulled a steel trigger
I had a .38 special, not a A.K.
As we sped away, Tony G. was on KDAY

Refrain: A.L.T.
Mama told me, "Yo, Al, you better change your ways"
And I'm a take you way back in the days
And I'm a take you back

Break: Tony G. {A.L.T.}
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo"
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo" {And I'm a take you back}
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo"
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo" --&gt; Frank Stallone ("Way back")

(Verse 2)
Back in '83, we hit the party like fifteen deep
I kept the chrome in my jacket so nobody'll creep
Way back when
Bitch's hair was fifteen feet
And the homies had the stray cat strut look
Now I'm a
Open up the book to another page
And how I rock a house party with no fuckin' stage
Crack the 40 and it's on
Yo
Tilt the 40 and it's gone
But
My homie Tiny O. has had my back
And a fuckin' pitbull that was trained to attack
Now
Put the system in the backyard (yo)
And when the cops come, act hard
Now
The powers on, and the jams come
{*sample jam*}

Repeat Refrain

Repeat Break Twice

(Verse 3)
Me and my primo, we was rollin' drop
And we was dodgin' the cops, cause we was lookin' for the crew
Spot
Rollin' in a six-deuce
I'm a target cause Mexicans never had a gang
Truce
Hit the spot, and it's dark
My primo said, "Park!"
Then we bailed out a '62 Skylog
Yeah
This vato rolled up
"Where you from, holmes?"
I dropped my 40
But Blanco said, "Stop, holmes"
I took two steps back
I could tell he was packed
But the skinny motherfucker's on crack
I turned
And dashed nine blocks
I heard nine shots
Now my primo's in a pine box
And if I go back and get him
I know
I can get him, squeeze the trigger on the nine
I hit 'em
And as I reminisce about my life (Mama told me, "Yo, Al, you better change your ways")
It's a wonder I still got my life (And I'm a take you way back in the days)
And I'm a take you back

Repeat Break Twice

[Tony G.]
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo"
"Take you back"
"Doo-doo, doo, doo"
"Take you back"

[A.L.T.]
This shit is dedicated to all the homies we done lost in the past
Go pass me that 40, I'm a crack this shit open
And just chill
The old school shit
And to all you gangstas
A.L.T. just took you back
Way back
Back into time</pre>
