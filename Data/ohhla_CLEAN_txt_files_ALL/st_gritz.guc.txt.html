Now with the flick of a fligga, I move in, nigga
one blast for yo ass as I let to slip trigga
oh, no, yo, I'm grabing my fuckin' 44
as I ? my shit and then I'm bustin' thru yo door
I had to put my mask on before I got my blast on
I'm made like that nigga Tweak ? and Mad Dog
pimp pushin' playa, playa pushin' pimp
ain' no slippin' bout this nigga
cause I'm all about my grip
ain' death bout no biatch
niggas wanna talk that shit
they playa-hatin on the tape because I'm stacking my grip
I soak it up like ? no I'm not the ?
I'm sawin' up your town-ie and everything around me
choking of blunt smoke, twisted of a light poke
niggas wanna fuck with me, they fallin' cause they commin' short
shorter than the mothafucka fallin' to his knees
but I still talk shit, stalk g's bitch!

? wanna talk that shit
but we all stack g's we all checkin' gritz
? wanna talk that shit
but we all stackin' g's we all checkin' gritz {*3X*}

now as I step to the corridor mourn nigga to the morgue
glock 9 times I'm pushin' yo dome with the chrome
as I'm bout to slay bitchy niggas like slaves
I been back and the gat since back in the days

? wanna talk that shit
but we all stack g's we all checkin' gritz
? wanna talk that shit
but we all stack g's we all checkin' gritz {*3X*}

Shut tha fuck up, fools
everybody face down on the pavement
if U resist, there's an R.I.P in gravement
the coward stuck cuz I'ma fuckin' blast you
duck and dash ?
reload the chrome

? wanna talk that shit
but we all stack g's we all checkin' gritz
? wanna talk that shit
but we all stack g's we all checkin' gritz, bitch
? wanna talk that shit
but we all stack g's we all checkin' gritz {*2X*}</pre>
