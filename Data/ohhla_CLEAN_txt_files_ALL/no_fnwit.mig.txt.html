[Intro]
No, No
No no

I ask shawty what's up and she was fucking with me (she was)
I told the plug to front me, he was fucking with me (I swear he was)
I swear I told her, they sit back and laugh at me (they was)
Now I'm Richie Rich, got these haters mad at me (rich!)

[Chorus: Takeoff]
Lil' mamma she wasn't fucking with me (she wasn't)
Lil' mamma she wasn't fucking with me (she wasn't)
The plug he wasn't fucking with me (he wasn't fucking with me)

Lil' mamma she wasn't fucking with me (mamma)
Lil' mamma she wasn't fucking with me (mamma)
The plug he wasn't fucking with me (he wasn't fucking with me)

He wasn't fucking with me
She wasn't fucking with me
She wasn't fucking with me

The plug he wasn't fucking with me
He wasn't fucking with me
Lil' mamma she wasn't fucking with me
She wasn't fucking with me

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Nooo
Put it on my soul, put it on my soul
It's quality control (QC!)
I came from kicking doors

Niggas never gave me shit
On the block working my wrist
Plug ain't front me shit
Turn that ten to a whole 36 (flipping that)

Remember when I met that bitch (remember that bitch?)
She wasn't fucking with me
I tried to tell the plug to front me a bag
He wasn't fucking with me
They wasn't fucking with me and now that Im rich!
I don't wanna fuck with them

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I told them I was gonna make it and they laughed
My teacher told me that I was gonna never pass math
Yeah she was right
80 thousand old hundreds, Jerry Rice

I didn't get a diploma, I'm rich for life
They didn't believe me
BET, MTV, made you see it

Lil' mamma she wasn't fucking with me
I had to go get some new bitches
The plug he wasn't fucking with me
Until I got all them Benjis

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Offset]
No you are not fucking with me
When I ain't had no currency (where were you?)
You know you left a nigga hanging
Treated me like I'm a stranger

The plug wasn't even fronting me a key (fuck the plug)
But it's no pressure
Im'a take the little nick and I'll flip it
Im'a flex on you like a wrestler

Even since a nigga stopped fucking with you baby girl, my life been better
And I'm successful
I can flex in my bezzles
I did this on my own, with no help from nobody

[Chorus]</pre>
