Song:   Foolish Little Girls
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This song was inspired by all the important women in my life
my mother
my sister
and I'd like to dedicate it to all y'all

just keep holdin ya own no use actin all grown
don't make yaself look like a (foolish little girl)
let 'em know what you worth you the queen of this earth
think otherwise and you a (foolish little girl)

this is a dedication. nope, this is medication
the antidote for the poison fed to a generation
thru sex lies and videotapes
slow down live ya lives put ya foot on the brakes
young'ns are taught to get low but their self esteem
has hit rock bottom so how much further can they go
I ain't here to knock the next man from gettin his cash
but 12 yr olds singin songs bout shakin her ass
Is quite disturbin yeah you make the joints for adults
but kids got ears too so whats the results
playgrounds filled with self-proclaimed bitches and ho's
who grow up to be groupies takin pictures at shows
I get sick to my stomach no signs of it ceasing
morals are non-existent and values are decreasing
was once ignorant blinded by what I couldn't see
cant let my little sister be a (foolish little girl)

just keep holdin ya own no use actin all grown
don't make yaself look like a (foolish little girl)
let 'em know what you worth you the queen of this earth
think otherwise and you a (foolish little girl)
just keep holdin ya own no use actin all grown
don't make yaself look like a (foolish little girl)
let 'em know what you worth you the queen of this earth
think otherwise and you a (foolish little girl)

they label men dogs cause we get weak in the flesh
so it takes a strong woman to keep us in check
never neglect the fact that she's the foundation
undeniably god's most beautiful creation
body heavenly similar to constellations
elevatin my mind thru daily conversations
confrontations when we make up its sensational
practice patience during her menstruation
cycle once a month I'm at ya beck and call
this is a ode to females gota respect them all
from 13 to 30 age shouldn't be a factor
If life was a movie she's the best supporting actor
I mean actress but you see the point I'm makin
(and what's that?) for granted is not how she should be taken
If anything yo she deserves an applause
you can only see perfection if you look beneath the flaws

just keep holdin ya own no use actin all grown
don't make yaself look like a (foolish little girl)
let 'em know what you worth you the queen of this earth
think otherwise and you a (foolish little girl)
just keep holdin ya own no use actin all grown
don't make yaself look like a (foolish little girl)
let 'em know what you worth you the queen of this earth
think otherwise and you a (foolish little girl)

got my priorities in order this is for my unborn daughter
so she'll remember everything her daddy taught her
9 out of 10 guys are only after one thing
If you find mr. right make sure you treat him like a king
be wise don't be fooled by the size of the bling
cause real love can never be defined by a ring
watch out for the lies in this crazy world
In my eyes none of yall good enough for my baby girl

just keep holdin ya own no use actin all grown
don't make yaself look like a (foolish little girl)
let 'em know what you worth you the queen of this earth
think otherwise and you a (foolish little girl)
just keep holdin ya own no use actin all grown
don't make yaself look like a (foolish little girl)
let 'em know what you worth you the queen of this earth
think otherwise and you a (foolish little girl)</pre>
