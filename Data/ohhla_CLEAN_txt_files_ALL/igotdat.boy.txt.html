[Intro - Juicy J]
Hypnotize Minds "yea"

[Chorus]
I got dat drank, I got dat drank, that purple drank (dat purple drank)
I got dat drank, I got dat drank, that purple drank (dat purple drank)
I got dat drank, I got dat drank, that purple drank (dat purple drank)
(Mike Jones) "Just had a fourth and a sip of eight"

I got dat drank, I got dat drank, that purple drank (dat purple drank)
I got dat drank, I got dat drank, that purple drank (dat purple drank)
I got dat drank, I got dat drank, that purple drank (dat purple drank)
(Mike Jones) "Just had a fourth and a sip of eight"

[Frayser Boy]
I'm getting full of drank leanin movin slow seeming
unda the influence will make you fall asleep dreaming
$200 for a pint got a dub get a "O"
really dog really y'all I can get it for the low
Which you know about them jolly ranchers make it tasty
frayser boy, swisha house you know me gettin wasted
real fellas click up you gon have to face it
yea I know these suckas on the town gotta hate me
Doin real big and my system full of that promethazine
have you kinda dumb sayin thangs that you don't really mean
messin wit that gallon too have me scratching for a itch
fill my cup to the brim over ice pourin it
2 Liters of that purple potion bout to ball out
pint sizing pints woah think I'm bout to fall out
frayser bizzle slummed out in the bay
getting leaner addicted to this medicine
yo I'm just admitting it

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
I keep purple stuff all in my cup 84's when I'm rollin up
big faces I'm folding up diamond shine from princess cuts
down south we sip that lean ride candy cars wit drop out screens
wit screwed music up in my deck texas boys finna get repect
I'm Mike Jones (Mike Jones) wit purple stuff in my styrofoam
from H Town to Memphis 10 I'm hittin licks on my wireless phone
281-3-3-oh, eight-zero-zero-fo'
you need the drank let me know and Mike Jones will have it at yo do'
I'm feelin good I'm feelin great just had a 4th and a sip of eight
I'm holdin it down "down south" representing that texas state [Repeat]
I'm Mike Jones I know you know my name
but pretty soon y'all gon know about this purple drank
Once that Codeine hits your system it gon make you lean
another fiend compliments of promethazine

[Chorus]


(Paul Wall - "lets see you po it up. swishahouse, paul wall baby")

[Paul Wall]
I got that purple drank that texas tea up in my cup
grab a sprite pop the seal pour a duece and then mix it up
I sip it slow when I jam that screw I hold it down for the low star state
gettin full of that purple oil I throw it off and I'm feelin great
I got that TV screens fallin down (fallin down)
I got them 84 spokes wit them bowls rollin round
fo fo's still tippin purple drank still sippin
duece po a 4 a whole pint boy I ain't trippin
grippin wood like a lumber jack candy slab is what I'm swangin
a white cup full of purple stuff thats that syrup you see me drankin
