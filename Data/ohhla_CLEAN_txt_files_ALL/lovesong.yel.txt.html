[Intro: Yelawolf]
I usually don't do this
But, fuck it
You know what?

[Yelawolf]
You're like the hardest thing I've ever seen
And I'm from the gutter so believe me, I've seen some hard things
You come from where the black flower grows
I wanted to cut you down and take you home, call me Axl Rose
I can see you in a 1976 Camaro
Me and you sippin whiskey, gettin drunker than Jack Sparrow
Is Black Sabbath how you get mellow?
Huh, well put your feet on my Harley Davidson pedals
And rock-n-roll girl

[Chorus: Poo Bear] + (Yelawolf)
Like a diamond cuts through a pearl (yea)
This the hardest love song in the world (hardest love song)
Oh yeah yeah (in the world)
You can get it in with your girl
To the hardest love song in the world
Oh yeahhhh, hardest love song in the world

[Yelawolf]
Yeah, you don't gotta drive a Fleetwood Cadillac
You just gotta know some of the words to Fleetwood Mac
Horror movies turn you on, pull the sheets back
Fuck it, I'll role-play, do it to you in a Jason mask
Your switch walk is like a switchblade
You walk into a room and it's like these other bitches get hit with a grenade
With that said - let me pull them spandex pants 
off you with my teeth like, Ozzy did a bat head
I'm rock-n-roll baby, let's go

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
You know how we do, yeah

You ain't concerned with new clothes or salaries
You'd rather run across the country like Mickey and Mallory
Be the +Natural Born Killer+ that you are
We'll hang out the window with a pistol and I'll drive the car
We'll rob the Dollar General for nothin but snack food
Shoot anything that moves, dogs and cats too
Re-enact the hardest movie scene
Bloody shirts and holey jeans, we the hardest you and me
Rock-n-roll baby

[Chorus]

[Outro: Yelawolf]
Load 'em up, load 'em up
Click bang, click bang
It's black magic
Darker the better
Heh, no question, yea
Yea, hardest love song, in the world
So load 'em up, load 'em up, click bang</pre>
