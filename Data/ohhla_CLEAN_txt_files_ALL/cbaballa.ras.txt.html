[Rasaq]
Candy drip, on the cherry droppa
Seat reclinin, I lift the top up
He's fines, for starin' boppers
Feet shine, when I hit the block up
Hit ya daughter, have her walkin' awkward
Magik Stick, like harry potter
Speak in her ear, and I brealy got her
Roc's on the chain, like aqua water
Ya baby mama, wanna holla
Make her swallow, then take my dollas
Sorry good, can't take my dollas
Sorry good, can't break a balla
You can't be my baby mama
I can't be your baby's papa
Sayin' Imma lazy father
Don't make situations harder
Gimme brain, it'll make me smarter
Take the offer, that's my advice
Going once going twice, showed to the yellow on my right
All I need is vocal pipes, and chicken head not a hopeful wife
A nigga like me, stackin' dough for life
A nigga like me, in frozen ice
Air force ones on my toes is white
In a red low lac, in a red throw back
Both arms n my legs don't tatch
Du rag on my head, no hat
Nigga, Rasaq on the block</pre>
