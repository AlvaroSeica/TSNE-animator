[Intro: Solomon Childs]
It's like, yo, man
I know I was wrong to you
I know I was gonna do something
I knew something was gonna happen, man
I knew something, let me get that money, man
I ain't gonna let them stop me from getting that money, you feel me?

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
I'm a diamond in the rough, diamond in the rough
I'm a diamond in the rough, diamond in the rough
I'm a diamond in the rough, diamond in the rough
I'm a diamond in the rough, diamond in the rough

[Solomon Childs]
I thought I'd run a marathon, instead I'm running from Babylon
Been through enough, my cats had bald spots
I had acne dots, my uncle tag teamed lunch box
Steel boxes of Corn Pops
Pops worked for Willabrook, momma worked the nursing homes and cooked
Taught me independence, strength and love
God blessed me with two of the most beautifullest people to love
Cuz no matter the holes in my Superman's covers
Momma was never bitter and told me to love all my brothers
But still I learnt the hard way of the king I am
Designed from the eyes and blood of my fam
Bad influence, get rid of 'em
This dedicated to my little brother with autism
In my eyes, ain't nothing wrong with him
I feel he got his own rhythm

[Chorus 2X]
