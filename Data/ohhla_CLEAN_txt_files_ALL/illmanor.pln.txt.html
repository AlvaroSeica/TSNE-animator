[ VERSE 1: Plan B ]
Let's all go on an urban safari
We might see some illegal migrants
Oi look, there's a CHAV
That means Council Housed And Violent
He's got a hoodie on, give him a hug
On second thoughts don't, you don't wanna get mugged
Oh shit too late, that was kinda dumb
Whose idea was that, stupid -
He's got some front, ain't we all?
Be the joker, play the fool
It's politics - ain't it all?
Smoke and mirrors, April fools?
All year round, all in all
Just another brick in the wall
Get away with murder in the schools
Use four letter swear words cause we're cool
We're all drinkers, drug takers
Every single one of us burns the herb
Keep on believin what you read in the papers
Council estate kids 'scum of the earth'
Think you know how life on a council estate is
From everything you've ever read about it or heard?
Well it's all true, so stay where you're safest
There's no need to step foot out the 'burbs
Truth is, here we're all disturbed
We cheat and lie, it's so absurd
Feed the fear, that's what we've learned
Fuel the fire, let it burn

[ CHORUS ]
Oi!
I said oi!
What you lookin at, you little rich boy?
We're poor round here, run home and lock your door
Don't come round here no more, you could get robbed for
Real, yeah, because my manor's ill
My manor's ill
For real
Yeah, you know my manor's ill
My manor's ill

[ VERSE 2: Plan B ]
You could get lost in this concrete jungle
New builds keep springin up out of nowhere
Take the wrong turn down a one-way junction
Find yourself in the hood, nobody goes there
We got an eco-friendly government
They preserve our natural habitat
Built an entire Olympic village
Around where we live without pullin down any flats
Give us free money and we don't pay any tax
NHS healthcare, yes please, many thanks
People get stabbed round here, there's many shanks
Nice knowin someone's got our back when we get attacked
Don't bloody give me that, I'll lose my temper
Who closed down the community centre?
I killed time there, used to be a member
What will I do now till September?
Schools out, rules out, get your bloody tools out
London's burnin, I predict a riot
Fall in, fall out
Who knows what it's all about
What did that Chief say? Somethin 'bout the Kaisers
Kids on the street, no they 'Never miss a beat'
Never miss a cheap thrill when it comes their way
Let's go lootin - no, not Luton
The high street's closed, so cover your face
And if we see any rich kids on the way
We'll make 'em wish they stayed inside
There's a charge for congestion, everybody's gotta pay
Do what Boris does, rob them blind

[ CHORUS ]

[ EPILOGUE: Plan B ]
We've had it with you politicians
You bloody rich kids never listen
There's no such thing as 'broken Britain'
We're just bloody broke in Britain
What needs fixin is the system
Not shop windows down in Brixton
Riots on the television
You can't put us all in prison
