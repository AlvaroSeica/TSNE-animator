"you're tryin to cover up the holes in your sneakers.."	x 2

[The Grouch]
When you first get it it's shining and sparkling
you hold it high like a trophy and start targeting
what you goin to use it on
where does it belong and for how long
you can barely sleep and when you wake you hope it isn't gone
(gone..gone..gone..)
for it's still livin
at the very least you're given energy and a lot of it, you're drivin
you wrap it in a ribbon
and you look at it all day
you hook it up in a way
that with it you can play
regardless of anything else it isn't yourself
seen in a reflection it's a super-clean ressurection of you're better half
measure that and multiply it
hope to buy it and treat it as good as how much you think you need it
I bet later you won't feed it like my puppy
and leave it in the gutter for some other to think he's lucky
but of course you broke it
cause you had no patience with it
probably didn't deserve it in this life time but you lift it
now what do you know now?
can you recall and recognize how it goes down when it does?
(does..does..does..)

Chorus: [The Grouch]

How many times have you had a pair of clean nikes?
and scuffed 'em up hella bad, kinda like these?
on my feet, man, I used to fucking clean 'em
toothbrush and everything
now I'm just mean to 'em

How many times have you had a pair of clean nikes?
and scuffed 'em up hella bad, kinda like these?
on my feet, man, I used to fucking clean 'em
toothbrush and everything
now I'm just mean to 'em
now I'm just mean to 'em
now I'm just mean to 'em
now I'm just mean to 'em

[The Grouch]
Seen so many waste away what they had, it makes me mad
but they never know 'till it's too late to appreciate and be glad
seems like the ones with nothing are the ones who put in work
and use what they have to get where they're going and showing the jerks
leaving them wishin they would have thought of that or just said it
had it embedded in their minds now they regret it
let it sink in and get to thinking 'bout what you got
how you can freak it or treat it right so you don't experience a loss later
whether it's a cross-fader, girlfriend or a thought
when you're mind is in a whirl-wind you better remember to stop
and smell the roses between dosing
cause for every breath you take upon this planet you're one of the chosen

Chorus: [The Grouch]

How many times have you had a pair of clean nikes?
and scuffed 'em up hella bad, kinda like these?
on my feet, man, I used to fucking clean 'em
toothbrush and everything
but now I'm just mean to 'em

[The Grouch]
At what point was this ok?
I gotta ask myself (self)
let me retrace my steps
will I surpass myself?
or am I destined to be lazy?
because honestly, lately, I really just don't amaze me
it drives me crazy 'cause I'm searchin
constantly getting shit then throwing it away thinking I'm workin
really I know the answers but they hurtin
covering curtains over my problems so they worsen
drinkin and cursin invades my person it becomes urgent
sometimes I can't live it but I can word it
and that's my therapy so dear to me and I know this
but often it's too hard to keep my focus

Chorus: [The Grouch]

How many times have you had a pair of clean nikes?
and scuffed 'em up hella bad, kinda like these?
on my feet, man, I used to fucking clean 'em
toothbrush and everything
now I'm just mean to 'em
now I'm just mean to 'em

(The Grouch)
Fuck 'em..
up in this.. creek..
