[Hook - 2x]
We guerilla pimping, this is how we do it you feel me
We flipping in Expeditions, and hustling for position
To go out and get it, now that we here wait a minute
Everybody get crunk, for this money then if you feel it

[Trae]
From the North to the South, we gotta kill all the plexers
We riding reckless in Texas, bo'guarding the block intersection
We in the club body rocking and shocking, it go down
Playa made to the fullest, starched up with diamonds that's gon blind
When they shine, all my thug niggaz where you at you better represent
Go on and throw your set up throw the deuce out the roof, ride behind tint
On the cool, better cuff up your bitch when the Maab come through
Steady turning your hoe's head, when I pass through draped up in FUBU

[Dougie D]
Everybody put your hands up, we came to party party
Crack the top up off of the Hennessy, and the Bacardi
Ladies get naughty naughty, shake what you got
Fellas out in the parking lot, let's make the trunks pop
Like the Big Tymers get your roll on, it don't matter
What you floss, turn it up when you hear this song
Good god damn, the barbecue is sho smelling good
See that's what I'm talking bout right there, hold up nigga what

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
Part two just when you thought it was over, hell naw
After hours keeping it crunk, is the way us playas ball
Leave you wishing on a star, you keep on
Cause fucking around with a playa, Dougie D'll sweep em
And don't be tripping with that plex, because we bringing it back
And ain't no love or kissing and hugging, there ain't no strings attached
I'm just a G this how we do, someone refill my cup
And anybody with a lot of blaze, let's spliff on up

[Trae]
And as I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trophy truck
I'm peeping all the fine hoes, trying to see if they work with something
Bitches try to be impressive with they high heels, and they Gucci cutters
While I'm fin to take me two hoes home, and then commits to fucking
That's self explanatory, this evident that it's going down
I wear my mouthpiece everyday all day, I gots to get mine
Say we ain't tripping or plexing, baby we having fun
So come and ride and slide with a playa, the game has just begun
We made niggaz

[Hook - 2x]

Everybody let's get wired up, it goes down
Let me see you shocking and rocking, and moving side to side
Everybody let's get wired up, it goes down
Everybody came here to party, let's have a good time - 2x

[Trae]
You see we balling outta control, and we on top of thangs
Said nigga don't hate, cause these boppers steady yelling my name
You see I'm tatted up and I'm taylor made, they love this stuff
But you can keep that bopping bitch, cause she ain't getting no love
I'd rather be flipping on the wood grain, until the break of day
When I'm thoed off they by my side, ready to ball and parlay
And fin to get hauled off to my crib, that's how it go
Better recognize the real, cause we steady guerilla pimping hoes, 3D-2

[Dougie D]
Oh yeah we party till the party's up
The sun is starting show, but we don't give a fuck
Motherfuckers passed out up on the couch, from getting drunk
I'm aside of time, this is how we keep a party crunk
And everybody bob your head, if you feeling me
Guerilla Maab and 3D-2, this how we pimping baby
Shocking and rocking what we doing, yeah we do it best
Everybody get crunk with us, and let me hear you yelling, 3D-2
