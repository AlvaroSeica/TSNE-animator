Song:   Bounce
Typed by: westbingmanson@gmail.com

You are my soldiers
Just bounce

[Chorus](x4)
When we bounce, you bounce
Lets make the club bounce

To the east what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the west what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the north what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the south what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin

[Verse 1: Lisa Lopes]
I, come to deliver, a message so clear
Do or die, the consequences, aint nothing to fear
Who am I?
I be the giver, I ride with the wind
Im beginning to redeliver, One deeper within
If you believe, wont wait for long
Better stop, look and listen and pay attention to whats goin on
Analyze and disguise before the bass is low
Recognize, the truth lies within this danger zone
When I say danger, my body emits
Chemicals straight to the brain so that Im fully equipped
I contain my mental anger
By letting it rip
From the chords in my pores
To the rhymes I commit

Chorus 4x
When we bounce, you bounce
Lets make the club bounce

To the east what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the west what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the north what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the south what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Chamilitary man
I pull up to the curb
Right to the valet
Then I walk right in the entrance
And the crowd is yelling hey
I got paid, so lets play, send the bartender my way
They say that money talks and I sure got a lot to say
Ask about me in the south
Mother nature say she proud
I been known to make it rain
Ben and Frank erase the drought
We dont smack outside the club
Im the hustle poster child
I Walk up to bank tellers
Then I pull my pistols out
Got so much jewelry security gon have to search me
Most people friendly but the ones who aint can never hurt me
A semi on the side, Ima call it Eddie Murphy
Bet my pockets speak another language like: arrivederci!
She thought it was a salad
She noticed all the karats
So vegetarian, all this green and all this cabbage
And Im feelin like Im the baddest
Get it if you wanna grab it
No need for words cuz hustle to me is automatic

[Chorus](x4)
When we bounce, you bounce
Lets make the club bounce

To the east what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the west what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the north what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the south what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin

[Verse 3: Bone Crusher]
I hear em talking money but I aint seen nuthin
Ill be bumpin at the gum shoutin: He aint sayin nuthin
First of all: Im a ganster, Im gon take yours
Big Willie in the game, Im a pimp and youre my whore
I declare, I swear, I aint seen nuthin hot
They keep talkin bout the cash, thats all these niggas got
I dun told yall niggas: I'm back once again
Here to take all these bitches
I aint lookin for no friends
I'm a grinder, hustler, made it, done it
I'm the one that aint scared
Yall niggas dont want it
Got a personal vendetta against all these mo-foes
Mentality of a killa on all these weak hos

[Chorus](x4)
When we bounce, you bounce
Lets make the club bounce

To the east what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the west what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the north what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin
To the south what you doin?
We bouncin, we bouncin</pre>
