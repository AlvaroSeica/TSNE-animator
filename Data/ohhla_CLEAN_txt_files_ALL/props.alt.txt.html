Check, one, two
Uh, mic check, one, two
Mic check
One, two
{*clears throat*}
One, two

(Main Verse)
Run
Like you were in a track meet
Better take the backstreets
Take them wack rhymes and them wack beats
And vacate the [{*motherfuckin'*}] premesis
You knew Jack Ass got a hard [{*dick*}] and blemishes
Cause I'm the rat, you're the cheese, but not a cheesy rat
I'm twelve and O, and all K.O., yo, that's my [{*fuckin'*}] stat
So picture that with a camera
Don't test my stamina
I get ill, I'm Godzilla that [{*fucked up*}] Gamera
Cause I'm a time bomb and the fuse is
All out
So ring the alarm, so the troops, they better
Fall out
And call out, the weapons
Stevie, hook the format
Cause my civilization's all that
So peace with no stops, and peace to mom and pops
And here's a couple of bars to address my props
Peace to Lighter Shade Of Brown and Silvia Rome
To Cypress Hill and my management Buzztone
And, yo, props go out to my homie Jerry Davis
And props to Darryl cause the shot that he gave us
Peace to Funkdoobiest and Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.
The Funky Aztecs
And the magazine Lowride
The Baka Boyz, Tony G. and O.B.D.
Power, Ruba Hitman
And Hispanic MC's
Props to Mellow Man Ace and Das-EFX
Peace to BMG because they write my checks
To Geraldo
And peace to Ronnie Row, too
To Kid Frost and the homie Will Roc, and Power Rule
Utaka
The funky House Of Pain
To Daddy
Freddy and the Joker, and the Tattoo Gang
To Latin Alliance and the Grimlin of the Zulus
[{*Son of a bitch*}]
I forgot my crew
Peace to Poet T. and the Bronze
And yo, peace to Showbiz
And Mike Greene
They got it goin' on
And yo, my name, is A.L.T.

[A.L.T.]
Dude, did
Did I forget anybody
Let me see, G
{*clears throat*}
Let's see, let's see
Oh yeah
The [{*motherfuckin'*}] west
The [{*motherfuckin'*}] west
The [{*motherfuckin'*}] company that is the best
East
West
And I'm out</pre>
