[Sarah Jones]
Why must you be unfaithful?  For women..
Men, you shouldn't listen to your selfish heart
It doesn't really have a brain
Besides keepin you alive, it's existence is in vain
And how could I be so mean, and say your heart has no place?
Because mortal men fall in love again
as fast as they change their face
I may be cruel, but think awhile about the hearts that you have broken
and match that, with the empty vows and broken promises you've spoken
Now I'm not saying females are perfect
cause we know, it's not true
But why must you be unfaithful
if her heart is true to you?</pre>
