[Intro: Kryme Life]
Yeah, Gaten Island in the house
And it don't stop, Nahmean, And it won't quit
Kryme Life on deck, And I don't stop
T.M.F. in the flesh, And I won't quit
Loud Mouth, And we don't stop, Let's go, Yo

[Kryme Life]
Call me Kryme Life, Cause I live this shit
I stick niggas up, That money I get
I hit niggas up, Run and go on a mish
Tryna dip four trucks, Pull in front of ya whip
Box em in, Half of you niggas is paper thin
You cowards wouldn't blow if I let you go in the wind
What's all this tough talk bout who run New York
From where, S.I.N.Y., We goin in
Better known as Gaten Island, Niggas be whilin
Throw heat at police and breathe violence
Stack cheese, Roast emcees, Plus enemies
From now on you niggas gonna respect our G
When you hear of Stapleton nigga that's my P's
Where the temperature is hot, Five hundred degrees
Turn it up out here, Won't allow you to breathe
You get hit up out here, Just allow you to bleed
Best believe shit's real all the way to the hill
When my African bulls chop you up for real
Hustlers post up G Street with the grill
When it's time for a meal, Hit the air like vultures
Niggas is Guerrillas who comin through with my buldgers
Scope ya, Caught in a late night, It's over
Peace to my fire starters out in the harbor
Grip iron, New York Giants, We'll squash ya
Wash ya, Peep and your ticking me harder
Niggas'll get buck in here, Like Ronde Barber
Beg your pardon, You will get left out in the West
The wild Ingines, Like wild engines, We poppin
Give you a spot of a Saint Vincent's
These niggas trippin, How we not to mention
We still is New York, We mean business, Oh shit

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
Yeah, Hip hop fans don't trip
Throw your hands in the air wanna hear some real shit
So legit, Comin at you real spit
When I put it out there, You know I wanna hear it playin EVERYWHERE
We rockin in your car, We movin in your Jeep
We playin on the radio, We on the T.V
Got it poppin in the U.s., They love me over seas

[Kryme Life]
Everywhere, Everywhere, New York, Yeah I'm heavy there
Even when I'm outside of my borough, Thorough
I aint every scarred, See the ice of this in my stare
Always ready to ride, All ready prepared
Go to Queens I'm good, Go to Brooklyn I'm better
Staten Island I'm home, Harlem World is whatever
The BX is ready, My five boroughs is deadly
Never slip on the strip, Hold my grip steady
It's only right I represent these cold streets that bread me
Payin homage, To all my people suffering bondage
Poverty induced zones, Niggas suffer from violence
Hardships in life, All due to lack of the knowledge
When I say Kryme Life what you think that mean
I live it, This nine beretta, Yeah I keep that clean
Half chrome, Half black, Seventeen and mean
I hit it off, Niggas get lost, I'm on tour
I payed the cost to be the boss that's for sure
The way I stay catchin these fish, I'm like a lure
This year for the record books I got a good look
Pay attention to the captain with the hooks
Where you at

[Interlude: Kryme Life]
Killin these niggas, And it don't stop
Hundred shot clips, And it don't quit
Flows keep comin, And I won't stop
Stackin those chips, And I won't quit

[Chorus]

[Outro: Kryme Life]
Where you at, And it don't stop, And it don't quit
And I won't stop, And I won't quit</pre>
