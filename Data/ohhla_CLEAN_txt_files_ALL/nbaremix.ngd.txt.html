[Verse 1]
Yeah, one time for them ballin' boys
Y'all team can't mess with us
We just scored now they pressin us, y'all fans be testin' us
While we drive down the court, alley-oops boy thats whats up
Now run the floor, I got moves never seen before
No Good, at the Final Four
Can't stop it yo, 'cause i'm a team hot ya know
Shoot three's till ya drop ya know
Now seriously, I don't think y'all team wanna see me
Crossover, make ya sleepy, all the fans cheer when we hit three's
Sippin' on a cup of water, now the whole team fresh ya see
I represent 'cause i'm a team playa
Can't feed no creep playa
'Cause I hurt the whole team playa
Get the rock, dribble around, pass around
'Round and 'round, pound for pound
Break it down, downtown, straight clownin'
EA Sport time
Reach for days, weeks to play, sneaks for days
Hey! Who we gotta play today?
Still slam on ya kid, forehead, all in my wrist
Thats what time it is
Thats real boy, throw it down ya need to kill boy
I'm a team get ill boy
