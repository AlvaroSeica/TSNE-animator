[Intro: Pain In Da Ass]
Nigga get you shot? You the boss
You know what that means? The boss
You're in charge, look at these motherfuckers out there
Taking about their rachets, talking about they hustlers
This shit is in our blood, we do this shit for fucking years
Get together with this guy DJ Boom, show my real old schoolers busting niggas down
Outta shape, outta line, but we do things old school
You think I was put on this shit to make them rich? Fuck no
You're the boss now JoJo, teach these motherfuckers about us

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Yo, Pella committing mass murders
In the park with the semi auto darting ?camp service?
My tool make your fam nervous
Put my stamp in the ocean and watch the crabs surface
The rap game, gotta love it
Like dirty water franks with lots of mustard
I'm nice even if I ain't got a budget
Great kills, we pop for confort
Out in Stapleton, black top is dusted
Take the two of them, watch how a mobster does it
Flow ugly as sin, when crunchtime
Punchline might catch on you on some tuck in your chin
You get the boot like some comfortable timbs
Battle who? Spit fire at your face, leave you with bubbling skin
I'm the type to gut you and grin, Mr. Irresponsible
Talk with his friend, Six AM, stumbling in
And I'ma rap till I'm a hundred and ten
Jump the cyphers and twenty-eighty seven ways them ?youngsters with gems?
Snuck in events, Yankee cap, steaming The Godfather
Broom out the window, I beef with the Bronx Bombers
Team up with armed robbers, learn with physical force
Rock Pellegrino t-shirts in criminal court
I'm like the hot tip on a horse, untouchable
I get myself a haircut, nobody clipping the folds
Buck eigthy seven with the fifth in my drawers
Stand five foot eleven with the timberlands on
And I was fucking with the thickest of broads
Slide dick to them whores, way before I had my picture in Source
Used to do scores, go to games and bet on the scores
Now its twenty dollar tips, you know the strippers at Score

[Chorus 2X: JoJo Pellegrino]
Yeah yeah, Pellegrino the boss
Streets is mine, so look both ways when you cross
You got a friend, I got a friend, we could exchange thoughts
I'm a powerful force, plus I cook a mean sauce</pre>
