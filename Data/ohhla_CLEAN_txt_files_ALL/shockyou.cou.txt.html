[Boots Riley]
They summoned and I answered
Their God forsaken call
Just focus on the names
Not the screaming down the hall
Your tears beg the question
Why you're bound in this chair
It's simply because, ay, wait muthafucka
I'll ask the questions here

Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
We gon' shock you again!
Shock you again!
Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
We gon' shock you again!
Shock you again!
Shock you again!

[Boots Riley]
You tremble, you're sweating
You writhe around in peril
But let me assure you
My instruments are sterile
Forget those electrodes
I placed inside your mouth
Just say what I want or I flip this switch
And in Cairo the lights go out

Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
We gon' shock you again!
Shock you again!
Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
We gon' shock you again!
Shock you again!
Shock you again!

[Boots Riley]
My name is Luc Mammon
I used to work with fire
Since hell came to earth and pain has worth
I put myself out for hire
For centuries my superiors have
Inflicted pain with skill
Electric is my pimp slap
I'll liquefy your will

Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
We gon' shock you again!
Shock you again!
Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
Shock! Shock!
We gon' shock you again!
Shock you again!
Shock you again!</pre>
