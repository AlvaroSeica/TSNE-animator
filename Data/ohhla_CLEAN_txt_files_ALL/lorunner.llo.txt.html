[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, Biz, fuck with your Yessa
Fuck with ya boy, man

[Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, I'm tired of this rap shit, ya'll niggas know
What the fuck is going on, and every rapper wanna clap this
Beef with 50 and Ja, Zino and Em
I'mma Staten Island for life nigga who push the Timb
And Park Hill be the most high, I run around
With cats that carry the toast that'll close your eyes
And get bricks off, right in the lobby of my project building
And I live for my family and my five children
Back to basics, now what the fuck ya'll thought
I fucks with Buck on some every other day shit
Indian yard, niggas wanna say shit
I take it over like that Nas and that Jay shit

[Bridge: Lounge Lo]
Whyla Baneeni, Style a Baneeni
Whyla Baneeni, Style a Baneeni

[Lounge Lo]
It's Lo Runner, 20-06, new cover
You see me whipping a LeBron James Hummer
I'm out of town with Don, getting it on
You the housewife cat, who walk with slippers on
Now New York City get ready, what you scared for?
Bush is petty, compared to my deadly melody
Now what ya'll thought OTF was gone?
And even Lord Mike know that I'mma ride us on, on
My talk is heavy and I don't live in Atlanta
But if I did, I would walk to my Chevy
Of course, yo, ma, I'm ready, I'm from the Hill, dog
So you know I gots to fuck with Henny

[Hook: Lounge Lo]
Simp, Simp, let's go
Staten, Island, Park Hill

[Lounge Lo]
Rhyme One arsonist, guess whose sparking this
I drive mics all day while you parking it
And I'm feeling great tonight, I'm underrated
But the niggas in The Source about and gave me 8 mics
My man told me to do it, so I ran with it
Started making up words like Mevyshopamaninit
And that's the kid, and I is him
And watch the kid come through and get high as him
Talk to me, I'mma walk with a Dutch, such and such
Said something crazy and your boy went nuts
Told Biz come with the disc, I'm off in a clutch
While Shortre, 1.4.0., just fucking 'em sluts

[Hook]

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Let's go, yeah, huh? Staten Island
Yessa yessa, we gon' tell a city to lay it low
Shout out to Carlton Fisk, free my boy Killa Sin
You know what the fuck we do
New York City, shout out to Wu-Tang, man, huh
For all ya'll niggas that muthafucking don't know
The Lulu Kid, those are my boys, yo Sight, I see you TF
We gon' ride, Tyrell, 1.5 Tre, I see ya'll
Chunky Blood, uh-huh, Stapletown, Theodore
Larry Joe, I see ya'll, ya'll know what it is, man
Holla at ya man</pre>
