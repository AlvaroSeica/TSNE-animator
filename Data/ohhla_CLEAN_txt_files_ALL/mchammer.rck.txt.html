My gun dirty, my brick clean
I'm riding dirty, my dick clean
She talks dirty, but her mouth clean
Bitch I'm MC Hammer... I'm about cream
I got 30 cars, whole lot of dancers
I take them everywhere... I'm MC Hammer
Started selling dope, I'm too legit to quit
When it's hammer time, I'm pulling out the stick.

[Rick Ross]
I'm at the car lot, I'm going broke
I pay for 5, they front a couple more
I take them home, like I do my hoes
I dress them up, I buy them clothes
Glass slippers, I gas hoes
Now she's acting brand new on you assholes
Limousines, I did that, 2 door coupe boy I live that
My top back, I'm circumcised
I pull it back, just to go inside
She thinking folic, I'm thinking wing stop
Feigning lemon pepper, I got my thing cock
Black bat mobile, it's only new ferrari
It's called Scaglietti one button like an Atari
I'm just advising, my profit's rising
Niggaz buying stocks in a nigga like I'm verizon

My gun dirty, my brick clean
I'm riding dirty, my dick clean
She talks dirty, but her mouth clean
Bitch I'm MC Hammer... I'm about cream
I got 30 cars, whole lot of dancers
I take them everywhere... I'm MC Hammer
Started selling dope, I'm too legit to quit
When it's hammer time, I'm pulling out the stick

[Rick Ross]
I copped a Porche, I was so ecstatic
100 grand a day my operation is so elaborate
Credit card scams, that was for the faggots
Mother fuck window shopping boy I gotta have it
Now my shit be booming all across the atlas
Puchi Puchi money long now we call him Alex
Had to move from Day cause that shit was local
Pick up the mansion and I sat that bitch back down in bocal
My baddest bitch is latin and they call me loco
Till I fuck them in the ass out in Acapulco
I'm thinking money every moment I'm thinking money
I bust a nut then I'm back to thinking money
My wrist froze, my mind blow, I'm off slow my eyes closed
You gotta judge a man by his principles
Teflon Don I am invincible

My gun dirty, my brick clean
I'm riding dirty, my dick clean
She talks dirty, but her mouth clean
Bitch I'm MC Hammer... I'm about cream
I got 30 cars, whole lot of dancers
I take them everywhere... I'm MC Hammer
Started selling dope, I'm too legit to quit
When it's hammer time, I'm pulling out the stick</pre>
