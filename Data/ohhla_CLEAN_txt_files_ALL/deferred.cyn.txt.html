Dreams are, the building blocks of my heart and my soul
The meeting unfolds, hoping that my story is told
Driftin, with eyes closed but seeing the deeper meaning
Of what I want in life, precisely when I'm dreaming
It's so misleading, but yet I gotta follow through
Holdin true to myself in rhythm is what I wanna do
Searchin, through Bible verses, books in the Koran
Lookin for the meaning of life and the essence of all
Deeper than the waters at the bottom of the Earth
The sermon the preacher's quotes Sunday morning at the Church
Breaking down the layers to the molecular level
Breaking atoms like Oppenheimer playin wit heavy metals
My dreams be the key to it all, I'm readin the stars
Rippin the pillow tight while I'm feelin the fall
Sensations takin me over, I'm sweatin until I'm sober
Eyes wide shut, I scream touchin my shoulder
DreamsÂ…be the personal things
That reside in my mind at the core of my bein
Things are never what they seem so I'm telling Akin
Hold true son, better believe

I quoted some words Wordsworth hope to the Earth
A poet sparked the vision that I wrote for this verse
I'm dreamin, broad daylight I'm battling demons
Sun is shinin I'm bent for disguise I'm screamin
Wailin, like a nappy dread, it's matter fact he said
I'm quotin a box tryna pick locks I'm desperate
The son of circumstance I dance in a rave and
My thoughts are the world my pain is entertainment
Lucrative plots I scheme while this fugitive not
On Mt. Zion where we meet program wit a cop
This futuristic bliss fist gunnin this pen in the air
I dare lyricists that wish to take it there
I'm here, OK can rap style with the Lugar out
Squeeze and we shoot it out
Got niggaz movin out
A bitch made approachin the mic with a switch blade
This day and age I rage against the skits made
I'm caught in this pocket of start
While the clones bark and broadcasted
And I fought to get my own spot
I'm the beauty in belly of beast
Made of hell seize heaven is the moment I wait to open eyes</pre>
