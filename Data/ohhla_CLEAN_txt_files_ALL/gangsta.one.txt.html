Visual basics, contagious criminal phrases
Rock penals sagacious for minimum wages
Found spirits of hatred on pitiful faces
In cages, locked in a digital matrix
Dance with the devil level lyrics in basements
Original slave-shit, my syllables're racist!
Taste this embrace the physically shapeless
Venoms on pavements, how I'm mimicking Jason.
Rhythms of cavemen in this critical ages
They're living on spaceships, 
we're in middle of snakepits!
Faithless cutting with scissors &amp; razors
The Wizard on faders literally crazed this.
Amaze kids how I chase riddles on pages
Subliminal, sacred, caves lit.
Blaze these jewels to rock &amp; roll
For old forgotten souls to scold the Ghetto-Gold.
Hold my pain, my mind empties a clip
Rent me a whip with two bags of sensei to spliff
Yo, my life's nothing but an envious bitch ...
So, how the fuck could you hate me for this.

This Gangsta chronicles feeds minds of 
honourable breeds
Documents read the peace with 
hypnotical ease
Anybody who pleads for more 
vulnerable needs
Drop to your knees, words of 
Muhammad will breathe
With unstoppable speeds atoms 
and molecules bleed
Behind that Hollywood creed, 
the diabolical greed...
This is beyond narcotics and weed...
Beyond vile demonic conceit!
I pen rhymes on tropical leafs before I hop on them beats
Popping the heat, mystique my knowledge is deep.
Swallow the grief, empty V-bottles with freaks,
Biographies teach on dusty sorrowful sheets!
The Sodom's defeat among King Solomon's seeds
Yo honestly B: what happened to the Mark of the Beast?
Following cheez your neighbourhoods' prophet's believes...
Ya turn your back to topics like these.
Apocalypse speaks, read a neurotic disease
My solid techniques will hit the rock-bottom for weeks
Poli with peeps, rep the slums boroughs &amp; streets
The God is unique, putting mad Body's to sleep
Hard to compete: THE STATE OF THE ART will repeat

Chorus: Repeat.</pre>
