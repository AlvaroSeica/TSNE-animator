[Verse 1]
Everybody wanna know where the fuck I been at:
Been in fucking Pembroke, with a fucking skin rash
On edge sippin' from a keg of vinegar
Playin' Simon Says alone collecting Pez dispensers
Stalking Megan Fox sending death threats
She sees my silhouette then I jet set
Selling breast sweat in water bottles, lost the lotto
Reading Robert Frost to this lip-glossed mullato
Hit Teresa up for booty flicks
Hacking phones, I'm the one that leaked Vanessa Hudgens nudie pics
Accident prone, spilled cologne on my laxatives
Signed to the Roc shortly after Mickey Factz did (fuckouttahere!)
Coke and Vicodin, smoke 'em right in your face
Boat rides in Kuwait, ghostwritin' for Drake
Been around the world eleven times
Built a cloning machine, created seven Kevin Federlines
Thumb twiddler? Never, sicker than ever
I had to disappear so I could get my shit together mannnnn

[Chorus]
Somebody tell me where Danny! is
He's prolly fighting a giant squid
Somebody tell me where Danny! was
I bet he's in Brooklyn selling drugs
Hey Danny!, where have you been at?

[Verse 2]
I been trying to collect this ransom for Scarlett Johannsen
Camping in Stedman's mansion, dancing with Ted Danson
Stealing beats then sell 'em to Charles Hamilton
Just to start scandals and shit, samples get flipped
Snortin' coffee beans in a green trough
Thinking obscene thoughts in Jimmy Iovine's loft
And I jotted 'em down; e-mailed the script to Kelsey Grammar
A sitcom about phone sex with Chelsea Handler?
It flopped, then I tried to bring the sock hop back
In purple knickerbockers shoppin' at the crock-pot shack, ya dig?
Raising seven illegitimate kids
With Ashley Olsen, hoping they all go into show biz
Plagiarizing screen plays for Jean Grae
Did a benefit concert with Green Day for free, hey!
Thumb twiddler? Never, sicker than ever
I had to disappear so I could get my shit together mannnnn

[Chorus]
Somebody tell me where Danny! is
He's probably doin a ten year bid
Somebody tell me where Danny! was
I think he's dating Ashley Judd
Hey Danny!, where have you been at?

[Outro]
God damn
I'm tired of ya'll niggas askin' where the fuck I'm at
When the album dropping?
When it comes out nigga
2009, D. Swain, we outta here man</pre>
