So what I did put together the bosses from there area so

[Chorus] 
I got North got the East got the West with me
So I suggest you niggaz don't mess wit me
So nigga be cool cause you don't wanna squad 'em
We could do the fool but you want no problems
Put that on something I put that on fathers
I put that on something I put that on mammas
I put that on something I put that on grandcedas

[Mistah F.A.B.]

[G-Stack]

You better run in the club when we grabbin it
cause we townin, my niggaz stay clownin
36 roundin, my niggaz go down AND
You gotta know where I'm from like ROBERT D
or like FELIX WAYNE or like LIL DEE
I'm from the V I DOUBLE L A G E
You must be dat phantom dumb if you ain't heard of me
we stack rice through tha hood like Yest?
rollin through the north and the west but I reps that east
when I'm throwin up my hood they mistakin for peace
cause I'm 2 finger straighted cause I'm so OG
and I'm rarely in the club cause I'm so low key
but I'm all through these streets like it
Don't know me if wasn't for the hood what would I be
Another average motherfucker but I'll never Be a sucka

[Chorus]

[Bavgate]
