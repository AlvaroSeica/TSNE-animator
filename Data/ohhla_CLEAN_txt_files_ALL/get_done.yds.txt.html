[Chorus: repeat 2X]
If you came to get it done baby girl don't trip (don't trip)
Get up and do yo thang when you hear yo song here (song here)
DJ's bring it back, move yo waist like dat
Throw it like a quarterback make a nigga want dat

[Young Deuces] + (Streetz)
Ok Mic Check 1,2 - 1,2
Crisp Linen. Fresh Nikes, and my shades light Blue
Mami see me in the Club they like 'Who Dat dude'
'ova dere by the bar girl he so cool'
From the hat to the shoes, everything be coordinated
I know you sorta hate it but it get me motivated
Dis Love thing is over rated
I one night stand ya, so when they ask, I can say we sorta dated
Please believe it's the Milly's Most Wanted
Shorty shakin her ass like she got a roach on it
Mami throwin it back, like Orlando Shaq
She had Hollywood like (Ey Yo Cleaze You betta handle dat)
So I pull her I don't waist no time
Body like a coke bottle and her face was fine
I'm like shorty where we goin yo place or mines
She said later you can cake sometime

[Chorus]

[Streetz]
It's on and poppin' Somebody girl low and ain't stopping
Can tell by the way she walk shorty club hopin
Shit I don't know how she do it like dat (Dat)
Angel from the front but a goddess from the back (Back)
Tatted on her lower back said she want a soldier
Work it like missy I ain't tipsy ma I'm sober
I just wanna see you do dat dance right quick (quick)
I'll play it cool on some 2 step shit (Shit)
Da dudes necklace, shine when the lights out
I'm in dis bitch flyer den the kites out
So if you wit it shit forget it we can roll ( Roll)
Fuck whatcha heard and know I'm hotter den a stove (Stove)
Wind you waist low I ain't in no rush
I ain't the police so nigga I don't need no cuffs
But she can make it bounce like a pogo up &amp; down (Down)
Strapped to death thickest chick dat I done seen around (Round)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Shorty back it up on a nigga like what
Da way she move on me got a nigga on stuck
I be like Awe break dat shit down, Awe break dat shit down
Shorty back it up on a nigga like what
Da way she move on me got a nigga on stuck
I be like Awe break dat shit down, Awe break dat shit down

[Chorus]</pre>
