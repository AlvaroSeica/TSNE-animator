Sup ese
What's up ese... what you know me man?
Si mon I'm your best homey and you don't even know me

This vato came up and said "hey what's up holmes"
I said "you know me?" he said "si mon I'm your best homie
You were born in September of 1975
You're already 20 I'm the reason why you're still alive
I watch everything you do I've seen everything you've done
I kept you out of jail because i told you when to run
You packed a gun at the age of 13"
This vato knows everything about me but this guy I've never seen
So I said "what you mean?" and he said "follow me"
I'm going crazy that's exactly what it's gotta be
He said "let's fly" so we took to the sky
He said "stop, look and listen pay attention 
Now if you have a question then ask"
Oh by the way where you takin me?
He said "stop, look and listen and you will see"

(Chorus)
Listen hear what I'm saying
Listen hear what I'm saying
Listen hear what I'm saying
Listen....(la la la la listen to me)

Do you remember this night?
Oh yeah homie quite clear 2-27-94 was the year
Gunshots is all I hear as we hit up the place
We gave those vatos a taste
Show 'em not to fuck around but i got shot in the face
And it was like damn what am i supposed to do
Now i can't die cause that means they got the best of me fool
He said "now anyone else would've shook
Come with me let's take a closer look"
He took me down to the carucha i was ridin' in
Who would've thought that a bullet I'd be biting here
You shoulda heard all the shit that i was sayin' 
I wasn't playin' as we were spraying I wanted to see some levas laying
Dead in streets of my barrio
They wanted to take my life and that ain't right 
So we had a gunfight
Huero and Dreamer backing me up
And we had the 12-Gauge Mausberg shells stacking them up
And it was like crazy
Shoulda been a western flick
You've got two kinds of vatos who don't give a shit
They came to my neighborhood and got what they got
In other words I'm not the only one who got shot leva (fuckin leva)

(Chorus)

I can't believe that this is happening to me
God do you want my life well then take me
But if not i need some oxygen
They threw me on a fuckin bed and now I'm off again
In the life flight helicopter soaring through the sky
Knowing I could die but still I won't cry
Cause it's like why shed a tear man
When everyday I'm wishing that I wasn't here man you catch my drift
All you vatos need to take note
I got a bullet in my throat and I'm trying not to choke
Cause if I do I just might go into a panic 
And then it just might be the end
Not for this Hispanic 
Fuck no I can't let 'em get the best of me
Cause if I die there ain't no way I'm gonna rest in peace
Knowin' that those vatos are standin tall
Laughin as a Lil' Rob having to take a little fall
But i ain't one to go out like a bitch
And i ain't that little vato that vato to go snitch
It's the barrio's on when I won't break 
So stop look and listen and you'll find that ain't no thing

(Chorus)

{Oldie}                         
I am saying the truth           (the truth)
I am saying the truth           (I said it true man)
I am saying the truth           (la verdad)
I am saying the truth           (si mon)

Ahhhhhhh</pre>
