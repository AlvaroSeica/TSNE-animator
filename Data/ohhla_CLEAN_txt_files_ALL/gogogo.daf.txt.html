daforce dog presents
go go go Crysto

[Rap]
Walk up in the spot
ladys look hot
music gonna pop
The bars getting rocked
and we aint gone stop till 3 hits clock
R &amp; B
reggae
calypso and hip hop
so shake what you want
shake what you got
I dont buy quickly I was taught to shop
your stock has dropped and I've seen your goods
and a flops a flop

[Chorus]
To the ladies infront of the club show me some love yo
Crysto
To the fellaz in the back of the club so go get yours
hip hop the drinks iz on us so dont sip slow
the drinks is on us so go go go

[Rap]
Got a heineken in one hand
jack in the other
puffin on a cuban cigar
pass to my brotha
we aint even hit the v.i.p yet suckas
but I dont mind 
the bumper to bumper sweet like honey butter backside thumper
white pants wearing dry humper
throw crumbs to a rat coming out the gutter
Damn dog you gotta love em
gotta love em

[Chorus]
To the ladies infront of the club show us some love yo
Crysto
To the fellaz in the back of the club so go get yours
the drinks iz on us so dont sip slow
the drinks is on us so go go go

[Bridge]
I dont need the sign

[Chorus]
To the ladies infront of the club show us some love yo
Crysto
To the fellaz in the back of the club so go get yours
the drinks iz on us so dont sip slow
the drinks is on us so go go go 		 	   		   </pre>
