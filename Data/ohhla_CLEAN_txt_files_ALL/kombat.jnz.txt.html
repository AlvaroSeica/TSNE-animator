(CHORUS)
You don't wanna mess with me
You don't wanna test me
Kombat the enemy
Legendary victory

(The Grouch)
When the white flag is waved
it's not my hand I gave my all to be here where I am today
You fall
My foundation is tall upside down and around enemy lines
Trying to climb...ladder on fire
Feel it in my heart then I'm smart plus desire
Carves the niche and though its not hard to bitch
My bitch is straight at 'em
I'm mad and quite adamant, why?
They wanna buy but they can't
cuz the rant and the raves is only fuckin with the brain waves
You need a pile of green to be seen, just clean don't cut it
I mean...no budget? Your loss
I floss only mentally
Eventually the cross gets cleared cuz it's meant to be
steared where I aim it
This ain't the same shit--naturally
Actually, you get a mixture with a batch of the Double L
Dope crew will swell
Never swollen, we get the ball rollin [we get the ball rollin]

[Chorus] - 2X

(Sunspot Jonz)
Nowhere to move or run
some never see the fire come and ressurect pain
My lungs scream retaliation on those
who live derivitive to ignorance
it burns as we give
Turnin the turnstyle of primitive methods and social interaction yo
I'm smackin em in the back in the box with jack;
they try to be the Big Mac with cheese see?
The enemy is any who have plenty of time on they hands
Damn, they livin undercover like they a brother
Do the explosions that are rough come from planet earth if your worth is diminished?
Like collapsing moments before hitting the finish line
Through time I'm a fragment of confession
Lessons of how we survive
If I die Mary cries for me
Thou shall live infinity
In oasis of harmony emcees will never know
that's why they get no TLC actin like a silly

[Chorus] - 2X

(Eligh)
I'm on call and falling into the atmosphere
freefalling across the meadows
Never giving in, surrendering is not the object
It's the beginning of my conquest to make a plethora
With a soft swing, bring tools of the trade presenting offerings
I'm drool in the shade--too cool
The offspring of my motion
Glowing so irredescent
Never present--forever marching
Four wheel driving
Legendary livin--surviving forever
Immortal rhyme patterns scattered and lit by lanterns
Poets--they don't give a shit; do what it takes then break
Do a greatest hit then vamp
He's the captain of the camp
Lieutenant with gears and oil to make the race
Disgrace the face
Not spoiled just got what it takes
Look at the way we roll, bookin a flight
I might just ever return
Never surrender, never burn
Holdin it down at every turn
Falling [atmosphere and falling]

[Chorus] - 5X</pre>
