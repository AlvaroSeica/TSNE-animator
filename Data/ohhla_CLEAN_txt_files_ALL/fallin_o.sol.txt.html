[Intro: Solomon Childs]
(This is the remix)
Keyshia Coles, S. Childs, Young Wu-Tang

[Solomon Childs]
You act like you don't wanna talk no more
Like it's only your heart that's been broken, Your so hardcore
I should've listened to the Large Professor
And hit the back door cause I was raised by my Momma
And my Nanna that I'd never hit a women to the floor
Cause of the allegations you hit me with
I'll be the bigger man and just ignore your up roar
See your problem is that you forgot about the romance
While walkin on them sea shores the results was sea floors
So before you go gettin galore and start remix'n songs with 112 like Allore
No I'll never let our love walk out the door

[Keyshia Cole]
I know where I, Went wrong when I
Loved you more then I loved myself
I would have done anything for you
Ah-Ah-Ah-Ahhhhh
And I learned when I, Realized you didn't love
Me the way that I loved you, But now I know
It hurts inside, Ah-Ah-Ah-Ahhhhh
Ah-Ahh, Ahhhhhhh

[Chorus 2X: Keyshia Cole]
Gotta get my heart back to, The way it used to love
The way it used to be, And the way it used to feel
Before I feel in love, Feel in love, With you

[Solomon Childs]
So what's so wrong with you love'n me
Especially when all you did was go on shopping sprees
Dove the deepest seas, Brought shoes and bags
I'm overseas, Nominees for the best couple in the hood was you and me
So I don't understand how you could move on
Cause birds aint on my pedigree
But as far as you leave'n, Give me a minute
Cause I aint cool with goin the situation is mind blowin

[Keyshia Cole]
All I want is true love, Couldn't tolerate no more
Love'n someone who couldn't learn to love somebody else
That's why my heart aint been the sammmee, Ah-Ame
I see right now, Where it's heading down
Same road I seen before, But no one told me
That it would hurt this way, My life won't be the same, Ah-Ame
That's why I gotta get heart back

[Chorus]

[Outro: Keyshia Cole]
The way I used to love baby, The way it used to be baby
The way I used to feel baby, Before I feel in love baby...</pre>
