(Lil' Flip talking)
This for all the smokers
get your lighters, get you a fat sweet
put this in, and just ride heh

(Big Shasta:Chorus)
I can smell the chronic in the air tonight(tonight)
smoke on, smoke on
I been rollin paper squares all night long(night long)
I'm so gone, I'm so gone

(Lil' Flip:Verse 1)
First you roll it up and put it to your lips
fire it up, take a puff and let ya mind start to drift
welcome to the world of pipes and bums
if you a weed smoker you gon' like this song
and if you don't smoke you better listen anyway
you might as well find out what you missin anyway
if it wasn't for chronic I don't know what I would do
I'd probably just pack all my shit and move
to Amsterdam where everybody smoke weed
over there you can buy an ounce from a police
so if I don't speak to you it don't mean I'm stuck up
the only thing it mean is Lil' Flip is fucked up..

(Chorus)

(Lil' Flip:Verse 2)
So all you cats smokin bullshit you better stop it now
cause the only thing I blow is Endo and Chocolate Thai
everyday I get high I believe I can fly
air freshner for my car, Visine for my eyes
I'm a smoker so pass me the lighter
I smoke so much I got my own fire fighter
while I'm pull all nighters all week long
you can call me and Taz a black Cheech and Chong
I'm own my speaker phone gettin blowed like a feather
25 dubbies on my dresser, yessa
I'm a chain smoker ridin in a Range Rover
and when I smoke Endo I use a flame thrower
some people use X and PCP, but all I need is light green trees for me
and if I don't speak to you it don't mean I'm stuck up
the only thing it mean is Lil' Flip is fucked up..

(Big Shasta:Chorus)
I can smell the chronic in the air tonight(tonight)
smoke on, smoke on
I been rollin paper squares all night long(night long)
I'm so gone, I'm so gone

(Lil' Flip:Verse 3)
Ay you got hash, Endo type flight cousin
I'm pumpin gas, by the stop light on Cuttlin
I'm buzzin drivin in-tox-icated
and the life style I live I know you got to hate it
I smoke, and smoke, I never choke
he got some bunk weed man get a roll
I'm crackin jokes, I laugh and giggle
I'm about to break it down so pass the scissors
roll up a fatty and take puff
roll up another if it ain't enough
I smoke blunts everyday so don't ask me shit
and if that weed ain't fire don't pass me shit

(Big Shasta:Chorus)
I can smell the chronic in the air tonight(tonight)
smoke on, smoke on
I been rollin paper squares all night long(night long)
I'm so gone, I'm so gone
