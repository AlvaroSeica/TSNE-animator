Song:   Don Status
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Napoleon]
Don status, yeah, I live for the dough
Put all your money in that and let it grow
Everything I put on the streets, I bet it blow
I'm hated by many but well respected though

[Napoleon]
First of all, yeah, I'm the shit, dude
The one word to describe me, is Ravishing like Rick Rude
Don't take a president's speech to see I'm big news
Slash five Jordans, but I don't make kid moves
I sleep with my eyes open, and other speak
When my people keep passes, what the FBI hoping
I'm a rare, the every breed's tattle tales
Fake niggas see me crack under pressure, like some fragile shells
Showing not to strain us, blend us, money piles of scales
Dudes like deadly die slow, I call 'em rattle snails
Back to the big picture, is it the music selling
Drugs or sticking niggas, one day, I did richer
Yo, a seven, when everybody down with your time shine
It's hell, when you see the projects through the fiends blind
Mike Bibby jersey, yeah, I move with a Kings mind
Blowing up that royal blue Bigotti in spring time

[Chorus 2X]

[Napoleon]
As the sun rise I'm blessed to see another day
Please God let my sun be alive, that's what my mother pray
Knowing that I'm caught up in the glamour life
Them 22 spins, the new Wheel of Fortune without Vanna White
You damned, I'm on some Lucky LUciano shit
Taking my girl to where them rich folks be playing them piano hits
I order me steak filet mignons
Steam broccoli, I'm chilling, my nigga, V.A., been gone
The hood grimey son, I need some fresh air
Hit the mall up, caught me new spaces, give me ya best pair
Cuz even though I'm young, I got a old soul
Ahead of my time like Reggie Bush playing in the Rose Bowl
Smooth as a young Marvin, I'm done robbing
Stop trying to keep up with me, your son starving
I'm the truth, which means I'm as real as it comes
After million dollar deals, I keep it trill with the slums, what

[Chorus 2X]

[Napoleon]
My next album's a drug dealer's holy Qu'ran
I'm from the streets, still I eat guacamole with dons
Soon to cop the new Mazaratti drops that's bronze
Left the drug game for real estate, stocks and bonds
It's not a game, cuz prison life is not funny
Them white judges got a grudge against niggas that got money
It's a curse, we drop dollar vibe us bail
Rather blow my brains off before I die in a cell
Father figure me, the streets got me going nuts
Sipping tangeray out of overflowing cups
I guess you sending me a sign when I'm throwing up
I'm five hundred dollars jeans, damn we blowing bucks
That's how we live it, I walk through the hood like I'm gift's gift
And ya'll know what's happening, that's Rerun and Rod shit
I know the whip game so I don't sabotage bricks
Just wait til that GTC in my garage, bitch

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
