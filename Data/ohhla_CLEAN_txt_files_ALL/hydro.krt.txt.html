[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, I remember feeling like this

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
I'm hydroplaning - it's been a long time since I've felt this way
Since I've, since I've felt this way, since I've, since I've felt this way
I'm hydroplaning - it's been a long time since I've felt this way
Since I've felt this way, since I've, since I've felt this way
I'm hydroplaning - it's been a long time since I've felt this way
Since I've felt this way, since I've, since I've felt this way
I'm hydroplaning - it's been a long time since I've felt this way
Mix the drank with the dank, got me, got me, got me...
I'm hydroplaning

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Thunder cracking, another day to be chilling
Nothing to do but roll up and pour up, and catch that feeling I had
back when I was younger, used to bum from my partner's uncle
Had that smoke that smelled like dumpster
Something missing, I'm way too high to talk my pimping
So I sip my Remy, that's when I first got tunnel vision
Yeah I saw it clearly, sunshine never shine like this
When I was sober off in the yo, I'd never rhyme like this
I think I'm tripping, no, I'm high, no, I'm throwed
Well all I know is that my world is super slow
I like this better, light as a feather, too fly to land
Too throwed to drive in this weather
I'm hydroplaning

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
It's getting harder to explain the way I feel when I'm zoned
High as fuck, money stuck, so don't call my phone
See I was young when I was tipping, but I wasn't tripping though
Perfect combination of elevation had me tipping slow
Fall asleep while we ride, cloud surf to my house
I never knew the strength of the drink until I melt away in my couch
and dream about the things I never had and all the places I couldn't go
Try to play it cool around my folk, but I'm fucked up on the low
Eyes bloodshot red, can't get to my bed
Cup of lean in my stomach, ounce of smoke in my head
I ain't been this way in a while, it's cool, I need to relieve the stress
With all the worries of this life, I blew it out my chest
I'm hydroplaning

[Chorus]

[Devin the Dude]
Yeaaaahhh, tryna hold on
But I'm steady getting higher as the sweet meets the fire again
Round ten, toe-to-toe with the green
See me, I'm bobbing and weaving, but he's choking me and cheating mayne
I'm tryna train my lungs to hang
cause I'm gonna be smoking till kingdom come
Sang the songs that chose to make people roll up the mota
and feel good like they supposed ta
Wanna stay grounded, but somehow gravity pulls me up
Am I upside down? Man, what the fuck's
going on mayne? Hydroplaning
As I'm going up, not going insane but
out of control, feel like it's out of my hands
Let me grab a hold before I crash land
Huh, because it's like I'm going crazy
Hydroplaning

I'm hydroplaning</pre>
