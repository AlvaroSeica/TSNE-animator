(*talking*)
Gut your hands up, get your hands up
Get your hands up what, I'm cutting tonight
Get your hands up, get your hands up
Get your hands up what, I'm cutting tonight

[C-Note]
I'm cutting tonight, I'm cutting tonight
The lean is right, got me feeling tight
It's like, I'm cutting tonight on blades
Told y'all before, we done thought of many ways
We them underground kings, like that UGK
Flying back and forth, from the Texas to V-A
I'm looking for a two piece
Cause thick thighs make a dime, playas feel me

[Hook]
I'm cutting tonight, all through the night
You get the girl on the left, I get the girl on the right
I'm cutting tonight, all through the night
Buy the whole bar out, and get the club on right
I'm cutting tonight, all through the night
You gotta let your piece hang, when she shaking her thang
I'm cutting tonight, all through the night
Gotta rep for my whole hood, girls look so good

[C-Note]
See me balling, in the mix
V.I.P. valet, just parked my six
Popping Cris', wrists is lit
Two AK's, incase they wanna start some shit
Like, you two too fine to stand in line
Look at all that back, can I hit it from behind
Juve told me, the girl get it from her mom
Say she down to cut, and she ain't looking for no drama

[Hook]
I'm cutting tonight
Told y'all before, we done thought of many ways
I'm cutting tonight
Still got my cut, diamonds in my grill
I'm cutting tonight
Got the lean in the light, and she looking just right
I'm cutting tonight
Buy the whole bar out, and get the club on fire

[C-Note]
We them Clover G's, blowing clover leaves
Got em boxing in the club, way overseas
I like them girls, with that hair down to they knees
C-Note dropping shit, you won't believe
Now drop it to the flo', then back it up
Baby girl, I love it when you act up
Later on, get a room and we shack up
Out of line in the club, getting smacked up
And looking for a baller stunner
Platinum and gold teeth, and platinum on the Hummer
Three or four new cribs, to ball in the summer
Let screens fall like the rain, and the thunder

[Hook]
I'm cutting tonight, all through the night
You get the girl on the left, I get the girl on the right
I'm cutting tonight, all through the night
Buy the whole bar out, and get the club on right
I'm cutting tonight, all through the night
You gotta let your piece hang, when she shaking her thang
I'm cutting tonight, all through the night
Gotta rep for my whole hood, girls look so good</pre>
