[Verse 1: Scarface]
Yo, let's, find the competitions so I can destroy though
The whack MCs who claim they're headed for stardom
They think I can't subtract the card
Well, Ak' will come back, wax and tax the part
Bought back the track that was lost I kept
These suckers are gone, DJ Akshen is back
And DJ Akshen is hard
Put rhymes together are clever, tougher than leather however
MCs of tropical feathers, don't claim to battle - I'm better
MCs died down by the dozens, said they was dope but they wasn't
Now I'm tellin' you, cousin, get off my jock cause you're buggin'
Got a rhyme, let's get tour, gave you a chance but you blew it
You fell a geek and I knew it, Akshen is back so don't do it
See, I perfected perfections
Give me some time, just a second so I can rhyme my selection
My rhymes will burning...
You see I've seen and I saw, a lot of fiends on the draw
Tryin' to get with the king, cool out the king's on the floor
It's time to cool and I chill, it's time to school and I kill
If you're down for the fill, just let me know and I will
Come around for the brawl, some MCs bank but I ball
They crumple up like a toy
Because my mission is to seek and destroy

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Here it comes, the voice of the invincible
You're gettin' dumb, come now, let's be sensible
You couldn't hang with the mastermind of wreckin shit
So get a grip and come equipped
Cause I'm gonna show the real meaning of a massacre
A mad man, disaster, cause I cause the, great one.
I'll never 'fess unless the best, puts the great to test
And I'm gonna just, watch them crumple up just like a leaf in December
Cut them tough, and yell 'timber!'
And after the path is clear I stand, the immortal survivor Akshen
I can't be stopped, cause I'ma rock you until you drop
So full of action, that you'll get dizzy then you'll pop
I'm the mastermind and not a toy
And my mission, is to seek and destroy

[Verse 3: Scarface]
I come equipped, ready for a wide war
MC's get flipped, one at time over
flogged and fleeced, the punks get beat, they can't compete
Don't try to make me slip, I'm gonna speak
I'll break and take the fake, who claimed to make the place
To dominate your mate from state to state, away from the mistakes
You makin' and then begin to ache the head, more like an earthquake
Lyrics begin to penetrate, to spin the wind that breaks
The skin, you evaporate!
That's when I'ma have to make
A jam to hold my own because Ak' controls the zone
Of rap, step off, I'm on the microphone
If you test the best, go check arrests and ask the press:
How many hands were put to rest?
And Ak' will just go get Mo√©t and hit the Sess
And still be posin' a threat.
Cause I'm the mastermind and not a toy
And my mission, is to seek and destroy

[Verse 4: Scarface]
Let me continue, or should I say finish this?
This is a dope jam
Though some are wishin' this
Will be the last that you heard of the Ak'
But I'll be back
To attack on another track
But until then you all follow the dream
Peace! - now, let me hear you scream

[Outro: Scarface Talking]
Aiyyo 'Red, cut that up real funky for me, you know what I'm sayin?
Cause this is the Geto Boys dope jam of '89
Rockin' it all the way into the '90s
And to the entire Rap-A-Lot family
D, Ak', and the Geto Boys say Peace!
