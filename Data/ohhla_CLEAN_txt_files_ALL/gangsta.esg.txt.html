(talking)
Some of y'all niggas are bitches too, that's right
But me, a player, from the third coast man
I'd rather have a bitch, that's gangsta you knowI'mtalkinbout
So right about now, for the year two triple O
E.S.G., Tre Duece and my partner Ron-O
We gone let the whole world know, what type
Of bitches we got down here in the south no doubt, no doubt

[Chorus: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
If you ain't a gangsta bitch, I don't want you, don't want you baby
If you ain't a gangsta bitch, I don't need you, don't need you baby, uh

[E.S.G.]
Now I got a bitch, that do what I tell her
Now she holds my bricks and hit licks on my cellular
My bitch is playa made, with a head full of them braids
She rides panties aside, gray insides on the blades
Now my bitch don't smoke, but she ride with the dope
Plus she keep a 25 stuffed inside her coach
Bag in the jag showing ass, turning heads
Tattoos on her thighs with the money sign on her leg
See I trust her with my cash, I trust her with my bank
Plus she's the type of bitch that'll bust a strip for the drink
If we ain't freaking, then she setting up a reakon
So we go in for three so fly off for the weekend
Properly to a rumor, send bags so fast brah
Don't know what I do, if the feds ever arrest her
Let's po' a four, slam my door, and bang screw
Plus some of y'all niggas are bitches too

[Chorus - 2x]

[Mr. 3-2]
Now all my broads is classy and jazzy and keep me looking lovely
Far from ugly, and hit the highway for me
Do everything I say, everything my way
I'm a, big boss baller broads got to pay like they way
Heezy cheesy, I do it the g-way
Do whatever 3 say, get paid on the freeway
No de-lay, don't stop it, 1999
Man these hoes sure be popping
I watch that game unfold over a matter of time
Cause if I get 25 she gone have to hold up for a dime
Like the ground you walk on, don't talk on my bitches
Cause everything I done, she was my only witness
In this gangsta life, gangsta relationship
Blood is thicker than water baby I paid my bitch
From head to toe, don't need to say no more
Cause when I'm gone now she gone bring home the payroll, to daddy

[Chorus - 2x]

[E.S.G.]
I got a real bitch, I got a pop a pill bitch
A sexy brown, put it down, to make a mill bitch
I mean a fine bitch, a top of the line bitch
Won't drop no dime bitch, down to do the time bitch
I mean a thick bitch, trying to get rich bitch
That'd hit the interstate with two bricks bitch
A all in bitch, a top ten bitch
A S class with the blue lens bitch
I got a super star bitch, a sipping bar bitch
A third coast raised that'll take a nigga charge bitch
I got a baller bitch, a shot caller bitch
That'll pay for a young nigga lawyer bitch
You got a young hoe, I mean a dumb hoe 
I got a post a million dollar fucking bond hoe
A thick thigh bitch, D.K.N.Y. bitch
So when we get married don't ask a young nigga why bitch

[Chorus - 4x]

[E.S.G.]
We off the heezy, we off the heezy
And if she ain't a gangsta bitch I don't need it - 4x

BIATCH, off the heezy, fa sheezy
E.S.Geezy, down in H-Tizzy bizzy baby 
KnowI'mtalkingbout, platinum sizzold
For the 9-9 and the two tripple izzo
Ha ha, anybody my partner St. Clizzaire
KnowI'mtalkingbout, BIATCH</pre>
