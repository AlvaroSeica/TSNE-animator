[Intro]
East side long beach, blap blap...COB, circle of boss;s
its your boy Crooked, lets do it to em....

[Verse 1]
They call me Black superman
Black Rouger Man
Fast shootin hand
clap your brand new sedan
Im raps Luther Van
Got hoes throwin panties
Watch the flow blow as if I rap thru a fan, man
everybody knows from sets vargos to varios
that chrome shotty give your body holes
and I body hoes
last chick they tried to set me up
I squoze the tommy, mami adios
I'm a gangsta
vest and a chain
aint no questions wether
I'm destined to reign
wont rest till I'm the best in the game
me and kanye got somethin in common
you have to attach the west to the name crooked
give me mine or I'm gonna squab with critics
I never rock without my dodger fitted
me and DJ Skee in a level 3 benz brabus kitted
I'm a boss, who got a problem with it
I live it so I can spit it
