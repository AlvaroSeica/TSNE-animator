[C-Murder and (Silkk the Shocker) talking]
Ha, ha what they say Mia (Drug dealers)
Talkin' bout No Limit sellin' dope
They got ki's all over the country
CIA, Feds, tap our phone, harrassin' us (Fuckin' with us)
Know what I'm sayin', but guess what...

[Chorus: Mia X]
If them feds only knew
That you were the one sellin' all the dope
What would they do
If them feds only knew
That you were the one holdin' all them ki's
They would probably kick in your door
They would probably arrest you and steal all your dope
So you should be glad that they don't know
Cause now you don't have to worry

[C-Murder]
I'm talkin' to them F-E-Ds, police harrassin' me,
But let me tell ya partner, you ain't never cared for C
I'm under surveillance and you done tapped my phone
But I'm not Michael, why don't you leave me alone
And stay away from my residence, lookin' for evidence
You act like a brother tryin' to kill a fuckin' president
Ya never find shit my game's tight like the Bulls
Like a full tank of gas, my bank account's full
Word on street, C-Murder sellin' ki's from overseas
What you wanted, nigga please
You plottin' on a playa like a money hungry bitch
Mad cause a nigga went from rags to riches
Slammin' Cadillac doors, it used to be a Regal
Stop lookin' for drug money cause now my shit's legal
If them feds only knew about my deals under the table
If them feds could only see I got mo' clients than cable
They'd probably kick, in my do'
And put me face down on tha motherfuckin' flo'
And take me to jail but I'm out the next day
Cause niggas with lawyers and money, don't play
D.A. tryin' to tie me to those underground casinos
Want a connection to the Mafia in Reno
Every step I take, every move I make
Ya punk motherfucker be watchin', fuck y'all

[Chorus: Mia X]
If them feds only knew,
About them thugs on the grind for you
What would they do
If them feds could only see
How you be gettin' ki's from overseas
They would probably kick, in your door
They would probably arrest you and steal all ya dope
So you should be glad that they don't know
Cause now you don't have to worry

[Master P]
Unnnggghhhh, they call us drug dealers, what about the police
Just the other day my lil' homie scored a quarter ki
From the feds, tags got my phone tapped
Niggas went to Florida, the homie got kidnapped
Now the game is crazy, sometimes it's hectic,
Make me wanna jump in the Benz and ride up to Texas
And ball with the niggas in the country
It's 1997, I'm tryin' to have hundreds
Stacked higher than buildings, flip it into millions
Roll into zillion, off ghetto children
Plushed out Lexus, niggas playin' taxes,
Mansion with a Ferrari but the game is still hectic
Niggas bout to turn to snitches, money-hungry bitches
The Dayton Family said FBI, we call em' robocop snitches
Got me stressin' smokin' weed to keep my nerves calm
And I'm livin' in this rap game like Al Capone

[Chorus: Mia X]
If them feds only knew
That you got politicians on your payroll too
What would they do
If them fedz could only see
That you got CPAs watchin' all your cheese
They would probably kick in your door
They would probably arrest you and steal all ya dope
So you should be glad that they don't know
Cause now you don't have to worry

[Silkk the Shocker]
Now what if the feds only know, seek out the Southside soldier
Post up, sold more cola than Coca-Cola
Now picture this, me ridin' in the drop-top Lex
On the block with ya glock then I roll up with the tech
See I leave em' twisted like a Twizzler
My house have mo' stakeouts than Sizzler
But they don't understand man, keep em' puzzled like the Riddler
And first thang first, if worse came to worst
Catch me in the Lexus, I use mo' rent-a-cars than Hertz
They can't understand how they had but I still got away
License plate out of state, in Jamaica the next day
Ain't tell the camera, caught the scanner
But I was ballin' in the manor
Nigga what now, peace I'ma get away in Louisiana
That's why I stay more untouchable than air y'all
They had me tapped
But that's why mobile phone get mo' time than airports
To them ATFs and Feds
Y'all understand I stay one step ahead
If y'all only knew

[Chorus: Mia X]
They would probably kick, in your door,
They would probably arrest you and steal all your dope
So you should be glad, that they don't know
Cause now you don't have to worry or do you
If them Feds only knew...if them Feds only knew</pre>
