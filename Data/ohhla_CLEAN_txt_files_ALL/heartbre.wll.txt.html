look out [x3]

where it's at
I know karmas comin to pay me back
I hurt the sweetest thang that's on the map
I broke her heart in 30 seconds flat
in 30 seconds flat

now how did i
just how did i become that kind of guy
to look at girl and lie right in the eye
my momma told me willy that ain't right
boy now that ain't right

I'm s s s sorry
I'm s s s sorry
I didn't mean to break your heart [x2]
I'm s s s sorry
I'm s s s sorry
I didn't mean to break ya
b b b b break it baby
look baby
I'm a heartbreaker [x6]
I'm a heart
a h h h h I'm a heart
a h h h I'm a

where she go
I got some things i gotta let her know
to fix the love now it's impossible
but baby baby if we take it slow
if we take it slow
we can make it work
we just can't throw the love down in the dirt
you probly thinkin I'm a f**kin jerk
cause the way i let you down it made you hurt
I didn't mean to make you hurt

I'm s s s sorry
I'm s s s sorry
I didn't mean to break your heart [x2]
I'm s s s sorry
I'm s s s sorry
I didn't mean to break ya
b b b b break it baby
look baby
I'm a heartbreaker [x6]
I'm a heart
a h h h h I'm a heart
a h h h I'm a

break it down
let's break it down [roughly x15]

so so so sorry
so so so sorry
a la la la
la la la la
la la la la

I'm s s s sorry
I'm s s s sorry
I didn't mean to break your heart [x2]
I'm s s s sorry
I'm s s s sorry
I didn't mean to break ya
b b b b break it baby
look baby
I'm a heartbreaker [x6]
I'm a heart
a h h h h I'm a heart
A H H H I'm a</pre>
