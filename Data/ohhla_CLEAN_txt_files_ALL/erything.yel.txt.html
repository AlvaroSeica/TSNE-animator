[Chorus: Yelawolf]
Why is everything I love the most, so wrooooong for me?
And everything I'm holdin close, is so far away from me
They don't want me to lie but they don't wanna hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most, is so wrooooong for me?

[Yelawolf]
Yeah, problematic, I'm so problematic 
that I'm probably a problem addict
Poppin Aspirin cause my head is hurtin
Hotel bedroom missin curtains
Sheets everywhere like a storm has passed
In fact it looks like I got into a wrestlin match
Empty bottle of Jack, I can tell I did that
I can smell it in fact, it's like death and ass
Think for a minute then roll over and look
To my left is an open book, a Bible
To my right is a guilty conscience
Her name is Brooke, my rival
At least I think her name is Brooke
She's asleep and I'm givin her the lamest look
Move her hair back so that I can see her face
cause it was dark when I met her at the game, it took
about five minutes to get her inside the whip
Another five minutes to get up inside the lips
Never tried really, man I really tried to slip
out, but it was just thighs and hips
Okay, I was high as shit
on alcohol and a Yelawolf ego trip
Leave her lyin in bed cause I don't need no kiss
And it's the walk of shame again

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
Yeah, smokin out, throwin up
Keep a fifth off in my cup
Tryin not to be a simp but every time I take a sip
I think I'm gonna fall in lust
I'm, back and forth like I'm packin a truck
in a house that never runs out of boxes
Knowin that if I put on my tennis shoes
and a fresh 'fit then I'll end up sock-less
By the end of the night flip-floppin
I'll B-boy if you let me hip-hop in
Alligator skin cowgirl boots 
only means let's get it croc'in
That mini-skirt makes any man a flirt
Manicures, animal furs and a purse
What could a little bit of smoke and Henny hurt?
You could make any jerk make a penny work
Sinister with sin in her
She can leave a devil sittin in the church
On another level not in the earth
Jessica Alba had twins at birth
Trippin sure, piles of E
Ménage-à-trois, piles of three
Wakin up again not proud of me
Yeah I'm a lousy fiend

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
