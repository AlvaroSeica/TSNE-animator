[George Clinton]
Uh-huh, AHH HAH! OH YES~!
Treat me bad, and I'll take it
Throw your ball I'll run and chase it
Fetch you the newwwwspaper
Treat me good, I'll do you tricks
I'm in need I'll catch a fix
Love me 'til I'm in your favor

I said a dog is man's best friend!
I said a dog is girl's best friend!

Oh a fox, can be foxy
And brother wolf, he's the guy
Shootin straight through the woods and ate, grandma
But a dog is a dog
Is a dog is a dog
Unlike the wolf who'd make a widow out of grandpa
I'm liable to save a life to you baby when you're lost out in the snow
I'll be like Santa Claus, so don't be dissin
Say you sho' can use some snow
Provin dog is man's best friend

Ohh milkbones for milk y'all
Make me stick my nose in there
And see who do I smell, ahahahaha!

Oooh! Uh-huh, uh-huh, AHH HAH YEAH~!
Pat my back, pat my back
Pat my back, I'm contented
Watch my tail and I will wag it
Fetch you the newwwwspaper
Extend your hand and I will lick it
Throw the stick I'll run and get it
For just a bone I'll be forever in your favor
Just let me go in the yard!

[repeat 2X]
A dog is man's best friend
A dog is girl's best friend

And don't forget puppy love!
And remember, my bite is rough
Much worse than my bark
Ass patrol the dark, woof!
Tear the roof off!

{*long instrumental solo*}

Dog, is man's best friend, HIS BEST FRIEND!
Dog is a woman's best friend
I said dog, is man's best friend

[George Clinton]
Extend your hand and I will lick it
Toss the stick I'll run and get it
Just a bone I'll be forever in your favor
Standing dog in the yard, GUARRRD~!

[repeat 2X]
Oh we keep turnin ya on, keep turnin ya on
We, keep turnin ya on

Hey hey, OWWWWWWWWWW!
