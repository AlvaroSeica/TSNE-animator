[Verse 1: Sesta]
Let it reign on the masses
Let em pay cashless, let em give away assets
Let em renovate truth, get away with the blueprint design to intimidate youth
Let em figure it out, let the planet drip away you'll get a vivid account for real
Let them vote for their soulless side - while the greats sit back and they're suicidal
Drop that crazy verse and anybody squable over who be hanging you first
Survival the remedy, while the creeps and the weak can at least seek divinity 
Let em seperate, giving bread to virmin, let em spread the germ and never learn to see
Let the church collapse with the PM in the back clapping his hands to THE SOUND OF THE...

[Chorus: Sesta and then Funkoars together]
Let it reign on the masses
Let it DROP, DROP, DROP, DROP
Let it reign on the masses
Let it DROP, DROP, DROP, DROP
Let it reign on the masses
Let it DROP, DROP, DROP, DROP
No time to lose, cut the bullshit
That's all the Oars trying to do - let it reign on em

[Verse 2: Trials]
Let em fall the fuck back
Private schools so they can afford to suck that
hedge manager wang, my deed is to damage and bang(?)
The 9 to 5, mother fucker work site - I work mic
Give me a ink line, let em put their form in
Let em leave work early - no need for the foreman
Let him die without a word from the church
Let him buy what he makes of his work
Let em watch while I disrupt fairplay
Kidnap Paris, give her parents bad hair days
Watch the mirror for that mad man
Got the spirit? No not the shivers
The drive to suicide, pill pass the fuck out
When I die let em praise the cardboard cut-out
They got no better, stack em, check em
Go down in history as the immaculate erection

All believers say:
Na na na na na na na na na na
All the heathens say:
Na na na na na na na na na na
If you act sane, and the weight of the world ain't nuthin but a mother fucking back pain
Go go go go go go go go go

[Scratches by DJ Reflux]
"Let it reign on em" 

[Verse 3: Honz]
I let em slave over 40 hour minimum wage
Until their eyes popping out like they've been pilling for days
Turn 60 - start digging your grave
Retirement's great - as long as you actually reach the age
I've paid cheques, some people's main purpose in life
I'm more like P, my purpose if for working a mic
Kill my nest egg, guess I ain't nurcha it right
Bought a shitbox car and box of bourbon dry
Let the cigarette help bring the end of their world
It's like ten bucks a day but that ain't their problem
They pay more at the pump for a bullshit war
