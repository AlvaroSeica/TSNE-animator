PARTY!...PARTY!
PARTY!...PARTY!

[Verse 1]
Me and my G boys rush through the door
Time to get rowdy, we's about to take the floor
Gotta let em' know, represent, throw ya hood up
I yell "Where my G's at" and the whole club stood up
We bout to blow it out, these women lookin' stout
We fixin' to break em' off cause that's what we all about
The party don't stop, pop the top on the Moet
And if we run out, I got plenty we can go get
Diamonds on my neck, golds in my mouth
This is how we do it deep, down in the South
Candy paint jobs with the twenties on the Chevy
Plenty Optimos cause you know we rollin' heavy
You never can suspend me, you always see me rippin'
I keep the yok stashed just in case they start trippin'
In the parking lot hit the brakes to the beat
With Versace on my back and them gators on my feet

[Hook]
But cha' know it ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)

[Verse 2]
Welcome every hood from all around the city
The women lookin' good even though they ain't sedity
Chronic in my system, liquor in my cup
Ya better take cover, we about to blow it up
Buck jumpin' to the beat, we all off in the street
We see it's all love but we still pack the heat
We keep it sucker free, steady firin' bud up
We all pimp sharp, we ain't tryin' to tear the club up
Down for whatever, styled women all around
Rollers in the back breakin' trees off of pounds
Niggas from the Mound, niggas from Blackhaven
We toss it up like Pac cause it ain't no ho savin'
Sippin' Alize, chiefin' hay with my click
V.I.P. section cause ya know we roll thick
20 deep on the creep, tryin' to get em' in
Drunk as a skunk still sippin' on gin

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Me and my G boys rush through the door
Time to get rowdy, we's about to take the floor
Gotta let em' know, represent, throw ya hood up
I yell "Where my G's at" and the whole club stood up
We bout to blow it out, these women lookin' stout
We fixin' to break em' off cause that's what we all about
The party don't stop, pop the top on the Moet
And if we run out, I got plenty we can go get
Diamonds on my neck, golds in my mouth
This is how we do it deep, down in the South
Candy paint jobs with the twenties on the Chevy
Plenty Optimos cause you know we rollin' heavy
You never can suspend me, you always see me rippin'
I keep the yok stashed just in case they start trippin'
In the parking lot hit the brakes to the beat
With Versace on my back and them gators on my feet
