[Intro]
You know at, at times I wanna be real, real positive
When I feel real negative, you know?
I just wanna be on the grind
I am on the grind, what the fuck you doin'?

[Verse 1]
Is it difficult to ship a boat?
Is a ship a boat? Bringin' in shipments
Odd Future equipment, check my statistics
Wipe off your lipstick, lips around this dick
Money make all the hoes swallow
And money move the crowd and make the crowd follow
Money translates from English to Tagalog
Struttin' life's runway you coked up model
Niggaz like flossin' until they floss ya
Busy eatin' got you feedin' burrito with salsa
The problem that I have with me is me
Where I go I'm being watched like channel Disney
Boomerang motive of a frisbee
Once he's going he's not coming back is he? Nah

[Verse 2]
I get to the point, absolutely pissed
Cut you off like a hand, absolutely missed
Can't shake it, the pain can't fake it
Life and love is like food, you eat it how you make it
Sound like I'm saying the same shit you don't understand
Love in my right feet and you the other hand
My cap snaps back like black rubberbands
The fact that I'm black and I rap brother man
Put me above the ladder, steppin' on bladders
Fuck family matters I'm a bad black caffer
Plus I'm a bastard, where's my male figure?
I might as well look up to the white male pale nigga
Grape to the wine-side, eyes to my blindside
No emotions, my feelings are dime-wide
I'm on some new shit, some true shit
While others play Brittany Murphy in Clueless</pre>
