[ 2Pac ]
There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in your future
But through whatever you see
Through all the rain and the pain
You gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that

Hm
Yeah
Uh
So keep your head up
Yeah
Yeah

[ Verse 1: 2Pac ]
Our lifestyles be close captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustle too hard to think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin on backstabbin vultures
Sellin my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin I lived my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears, save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve, just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin in the projects, broke with no lights on
So all the seeds that follow me, protect yo essence
Born with less, but you're still precious
Just smile for me now

[ CHORUS: Johnny P, (2Pac) ]
Smile for me
(Haha, just smile for me now)
Won't you just smile
(Smile)
Smile
Smile for me
(What cha lookin all sad for, nigga you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me
(You ain't got nothin' to be worried about, nigga)
Won't you smile
(No doubt, smile for me now) 
Won't you just smile for me
(And the next generation...)

[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]
Now as I open up my story, put the blaze in yo blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly upon phrases I run
And I can walk you through the days that are done
I often wish that I could save everyone
But I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin the pain
Turnin circles in my ninth grade, dealin cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin the strain
And a man without a focus, life can drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin it change
But when I focus on reality, we broke and enchained
Had a dream of livin wealthy and makin it big
Over football chose to cook raw, would take it and dig
And after all my momma's thankin God for blessin her child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile

[ Johnny P ]
Smile for me
Would you smile
Would you just smile for me

[ Verse 3: 2Pac ]
Fuck the world, as we are loc'in witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin, curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin, crooked thoughts laced with weed
Learnin, duckin stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin
Inhalin sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I entered many penitentaries the best revenge
Is fuck friends, we military minded soldiers
Bustin shots blindly tryin to find Jehovah 
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga

[ Scarface ] 
And now a moment of silence
Let us pray
And as you journey into outer space
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that have passed away
Be there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you head to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayer for the homie 'Pac

[ Johnny P ]
Smile
Would you just smile for me
(Smile)
Smile for me
Would you just smile for me
Smile for me
All you need to do is smile for me
Woooo-oh smile for me
Come on
Smile for me</pre>
