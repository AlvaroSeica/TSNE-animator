Song:   Writing it Down
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I was born on the cold side of the mountain
I wanna wake up on the warm side of the bed
How I start here
And how I end there
That is the part I ain't worked out yet

Every day I climb a little bit higher
Every night I learn something new
I'm writing it down
In case I forget
One day it'll be my story for you

[Chorus]
On every page you will know how much I love you
In every line you will see how much I care
With every word we'll grow a little closer
Even though we both know I can't be there
That's why I'm writing it down down down down down
Ohhhhhhhh I'm writing it down
For you and for me
And for the whole wide world to read
Ohhhhhhhh I'm writing it down

All my life I've been hoping and praying
For my time to finally arrive
To put down this pen
To say it's the end
And wake up back home with you by my side

[Repeat Chorus]

I was born on the cold side of the mountain
I wanna wake up on the warm side of the bed
How I start here
And how I end there
That is the part I ain't worked out yet</pre>
