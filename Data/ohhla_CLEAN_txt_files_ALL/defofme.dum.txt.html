Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Dungeon Masta]
My style's agile, shows versatility
And to all M.C.'s, beyond their ability
Only the strong survive, to face my brutality
The day that I will die, will also be the def of me
The day that I will die, will also be the def of me
The day that I will die, will also be the def of me
The day that I will die, will also be the def of me
The day that I will die, will also be the def of me

[Dungeon Masta]
At last, face the mentor, rhyme pretendor
A criminal genius like Lex, get more sex than Luther
I activate the jam structure, if you want it, come and get it
You don't want a piece of this, muthafucka
My cypher, contains elements of morbid demons
Who disguise my history english, recognize
We just want the CREAM, relax, don't do it
If I smell, pull it, and I'mma screw it
I keep it thorough, in all of my boroughs
Get me acting, seen you once, and never worry with the quickness
Get the message through your peoples, to mind they fucking business
I love trouble like police who love they drug bust
Think of planted gats we bust, gettin' away from jakers
I bust like could you flow, hit ya soul like a splinter
My temper force more than a stormy day in September
Hey you, the command's Wu, burning down your town
Bring it down, Dungeon make you drown in the under

[Chorus]

[Dungeon Masta]
I stay the maniac, that's in yo hood up to no good
Face the caution, never the one to lose like Steve Austin
Creeping on the e-mail, appearing women like Arabians
Stay in the trouble, sober M.C.'s
Got a relief from the mothership, to conquer dudes
Got the new Gambino, witnesses behind to find the crime
How deep do all you get, to have them blocking suffocication
Retaliation, cuz there's no, ooh, the vibration
Ya'll back for something, plus I'm old/new and I'm Dungeon
Masta of madness, then I'm lunging, cough up the blood vessels
Keep it, it's gonna get you, then I release begin
Singing, I hate fiends who all think they done playing
Done arising, custom muthafucka you'll never brick laying
Demented, I had to keep it tight, aight
Cuz ninety now, forty percent darker, now my globe is spinning round
A stone savage, I make hits higher than average
Love to cause damage, to release to your carriage

[Chorus]

[Dungeon Masta]
I live amongst the world of convicts, that's on some shit
And my thoughts be murderous, running wild with ya trick
Get with the professional, in the woods just like a pack of wolves
That's not making logical, to the eye of a rule dementor
Of the world's large, don't fear none
Step into the rhyme, of temperature's and then you're done
Yes, it's no illusion, do comprehend, morbid bitches
I inject to make you purified preach, do you wanna drink some berry acid?
And build your casket, avenge this, bruise the action, told you relaxing
But no, the dawn of the dead, unlock the P.O.W.
And bringing terror to the fiend who want me, and I know
No time, dude, put the glocks down, let's dance
And never in, whatever our hearts desire, let's start
A bonfire, fuck the world, it's better war
With coppers, I'll be a dirty til I retire
