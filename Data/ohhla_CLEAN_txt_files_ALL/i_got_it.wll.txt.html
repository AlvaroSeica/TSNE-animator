Honey lookin good from her head to her toe
Beauty overload, body out of control
She twenty-fo', she could be a model
So beautiful, also natural
Mami lookin good from her head to her feet
She forty-fo' but she still lookin sweet
And you can tell her daughter ain't even at her peak
Cause her mama lookin so hot packin that heat
So be a good girl and thank yo' mama
She had you steamin like a sauna
Look at her, look at her, here she come now
Look at her, look at her, here she come

[Chorus]

[will.i.am]
Girl your beauty is a sensation
You send men into temptation
I never knew a girl could shine like a sun
You better thank your mama cause girl you the one
We should have a day of celebration
Celebratin God's best creation
Girl you gotta beautiful vibration
Every day should be your birthday hon
You make the guys all dumb
Maybe cause you're blessed with the beautiful buns
Maybe cause your beauty keep the dues on sprung
Wonderin just where you got that from
