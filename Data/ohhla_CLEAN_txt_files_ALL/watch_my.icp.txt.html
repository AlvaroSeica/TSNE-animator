so there I am, right?
standing in front of the store
and this motherfucker wants to pull up
and has the gall to say to me..

watch my ride, while I'm inside
this bitch is new, worth more than you
don't stand too close, just stand on post
and watch my ride, while I'm inside (fuck you)

watch my whip, don't even trip
it's cherry-dipped, so save that lip
eyes on them spokes, I'm grabbing smokes (hahaha)
watch my ride, while I'm inside

[Chorus 2X]
and that's when we fuck him up
fuck him up, fuck him up, fuck him up

well I took his life and I took his ride
and I took 'em both to the echoside
the cops ain't on to me yet in this big city
down a back road pushing 150
surfing on the roof of his sweet-ass car
wicked clown alive with no driver
ghost rider, jump off into the night
when the car wraps up around a street light

[Chorus 2X]
and that's when we fuck him up
fuck him up, fuck him up, fuck him up

watch my ride, while I'm inside
you see them wheels? electric eels
my shit is rare, you barely there (I'm everywhere)
so watch my ride, while I'm inside (blow these nuts)

you nobody, I throw money
you might get some, so don't be dumb
I'll hold the keys (fuck you) still rollin d's (fuck you)
watch my ride (kiss my ass) while I'm inside (fuck you)

[Chorus 2X]
and that's when we fuck him up
fuck him up, fuck him up, fuck him up</pre>
