[Intro/Chorus]
Get it goin on
Get it goin on
Get it goin on
Get it goin on

[Chris Lowe]
That's what I say when I mean what I say
Get it goin on right now dawg, andele
You know y'all sittin, silly lookin {bullshittin}
Get a move on, see my groove on, huh
Ain't no time to burn where I'm from
So y'all can catch on, catch up or look dumb
So many of us left back in the dust
Street knowledge a must, who a {nigga} can trust?
Waste your life away if y'all want
When a {nigga} get paid, you wonder why he wanna flaunt
He on point, on time, on cue
Get your {shit} together, you can do it too
And get it goin on

[Chorus]

[Chris Lowe]
Now take my night life for instance
Smooth like smoke from the incense
Daytime my mind scramblin fo' sho'
Got to get back at the house, safe and secure
Might hit the bar 'round 12, it depends
They be frontin at the door man, let me in
Chuck with me, yo you know we gon' get through
Y'all play that pretty shit if y'all want to
Next we in the usual we win again uh-huh
It's all in my face, chicks all on my case huh
To the bar, where we are, no sweat
Let's get right, couple snakebites
Roll it backward, make you act good too
We don't really club too long
But we get it goin on

[Chorus]

[Chris Lowe]
Last test, drop that stress
When you think about it, how you got blessed
Live your life, don't hurt nobody
Stay out of jail, black life so frail
Use the streets for the black production
I still see "Self Destruction"
West coast the same, y'all still the same game
I remember the plot back in the day that was hot
Take control, be glad you got soul
Feel the relief, let God handle your beef
That's all I'ma say, Chris Lowe all gone
Y'all all in the streets, baby stay strong
And get it goin on

[Chorus]
