Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo Yo Yo
Straight from the shed
With a shovel in my hand
My bible's a rifle you gotta understand (yeah)
That the streets need a weapon
And out here, the sheep need a shepard
So as long as I'm here you won't witness evil
I'm a rhyme to a sky full of christmas beetles
Where, mind power cracks the code
My welcome mat to a happy home

Rattlin bones and a broken compass
Watch me use those bones as drumsticks
Bam Bam it's Bedrock baby
Ringin the alarm that we set off daily
Gone with the wind when I'm out the sunroof
I sleep on the gas in a muddy pair of ugboots
In the back is my lucky dingo
And he attacks like a punch from Kimbo
Slice, dice scratch my lyrics
And see my DJ? Yeah that's my lizard

Still there when the ship is sinking
Cause we're the kings of wishful thinking
In a house that lays in my head and the
Sun was money there were days that I spent
With my face to the fence, speechless,
Until I made you my friend
That's when your mates came by,
And you said listen to this and you did
With headphones on in a zone unknown now I'm glad you know where I live (right here)

Together we stand, divided we fall
To play this game keep your eyes on the ball
Live for the minute, die for the culture
See through the dark when the violet is ultra

Smoke don't rise
Fuel don't burn
Sun don't shine no more
Late one night, sorrow come round
Scratching at my door
But I cut my hands
And break my back
Draggin' this bag of stones
Till they bury me down, beneath the ground
With the dust and rattlin'

I just daydream from the front seat of a humvee
Press eject then bungee to jumanji
To the place where the rhino's rumble
Spread far like the hydro hustle
In the jungle fall with chainsaws
Sell fate to walk though maze walls
Free thinkers, free talkers
Waltz on water like sea walkers

Rise up, levitate like this
Till times up, celebrate life's gifts
Paint pop culture like Warhol
With the words that I churn though my portal
An electric, lightning bolt sky
Dive inside my kaliedoscope eyes
The vision is a sight to see
There should'nt be a place on earth where life is cheap
Space pirate, cat with golden wings
Raise your sail, catch your solar wind
I just ride away have a story,
Cats cook in their hide-away labratories

Let it simmer, bubble and slow
Beers in the bin, Blood in the bowl
Never... My office desktop is... and...
My band spans the high and low frequencies
Love life and it's ideo syncrocies
Simply called a rap with friends
Another artistic awesome accident
This is for you, stand in the rain with a
Vista view the champion change
Until it's late and the canvas is stained
When the paints sprayed and the canisters drained

Smoke don't rise
Fuel don't burn
Sun don't shine no more
Late one night, sorrow come round
Scratching at my door
But I cut my hands
And break my back
Draggin' this bag of stones
Till they bury me down, beneath the ground
With the dust and rattlin'</pre>
