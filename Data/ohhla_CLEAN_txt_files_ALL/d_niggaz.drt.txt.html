We some dirty niggaz born to die
However, whenever you feel that you ready to kill
Bring it on muthafucka if you ready to fire
And watch that pride get yo whole squad crucified
Na Nah na nah
2x

Now I was baptized in the blood of the devil himself
Thats why the reason for my life is always followed by death
Take hold yo breath and bust
Till you see no legs standing up
Showin no luv, dirty commited the world bloodiest massacre
On yo whole crew
Mafia style nigga, slicing yo esaphagus
Dumpin yo ass in the Alabama river (and I mean that)
You hear me, youll be 20 feet deep in yo Caprice
Wit plenty seat back (you feel me)
I'm considered armed and dangerous, its dem dirty boys
AKA Montgemery Stranglers, keepin up that fuss
With that stuff from Dr. Finger (kill them bitches that snitch)
And that goes out to all my drug slingaz
Throw yo guns up.. and before you bring em down let 6 rounds bust
Blah blow blah blow
I'm the fear in yo imagination however lust and greed rolls everyday 
In this whole entire nation!!

I never deny a killin so if you got that feelin
You know where I be, just grab yo heat 
and we can let bullets just skeet, now feel me
fuck yo pride cuz its time to ride and if I die tell my folks
that I went out live
But nigga get real cuz I buck to kill 
and I couldnt have it no other way
feel you wit hollow point slugs, youll be wet up
from yo chest to yo face nigga
what about yo bitch clique? who they killin huh
who they burnin the shit seem lame to me
cuz them hoes saw me and dem bitches start runnin
but I'm buckin low nigga, and I'm bucking high nigga
lite up the whole damn sky like the fourth of july
wit my pistol fire
because we brang the noise now we can play wit some thangs
but I bet you they wont be toys
bitch youll get destroyed boi boi
now yous a goner take it how you wanna 
I'm gone off bohemian crunk yessa
them dirty boys love to rumble cuz we always rule
I'm in the industry and we fin to act a fuckin fool Yessa!!</pre>
