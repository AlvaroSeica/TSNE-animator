[Intro]
Rack Rack City bitch {*3X*}
Mustard on the beat!

[Tyga]
Rack City bitch, Rack Rack City bitch
Ten ten, ten twenties on ya titties bitch
Hundred deep, V.I.P., no guest list
T-T-Raw, you don't know who you fuckin with
Got my other bitch fuckin with my other bitch
Fuckin all night, nigga we ain't celibate
Make it sound too dope, I ain't sellin it
Bar fresher than a muh'fuckin peppermint
A gold letter means last king killin shit
Young Money, Young Money and we gettin rich
Got'cha grandma on my dick (hah~!)
Girl, you know what it is

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Rack City bitch, Rack Rack City bitch {*3X*}
Ten ten, ten twenties and the fifties bitch

[Tyga]
I'ma muh'fuckin star (star)
Look at the paint on the car (car)
Too much rim make the ride too hard
Tell that bitch hop out, walk the boulevard
I need my money pronto
Get it in the +Mourning+ like +Alonzo+
Rondo, Green got cheese like a nacho
If you ain't got no ass bitch wear a poncho
Head honcho, got my seat back
Nigga starin at me don't get bapped
Got my shirt off, the club too packed
It's too turnt, goin up like gas
God damn, pulled out my racks
Mike, Mike Jackson, nigga yeah +I'm Bad+
Rat-tat-ta-tat tatted up on my back
All the hoes love me, you know what it is

[Chorus]

[Outro: repeat 2X]
Throwin hunnids hunnids
Hunnids hunnids
Throwin hunnids hunnids
Rack City Bitch, Rack Rack City Bitch</pre>
