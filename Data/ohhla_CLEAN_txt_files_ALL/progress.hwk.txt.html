[Intro: Tommy Whispers]
Money first, T.M.F. The Money First

[Tommy Whispers]
New day in age, New faces gettin payed
Screw faces gettin sprayed, Keep your eyes on the paper
And watch out for the raid cause they commin to getcha
Them ugly ass mornings I will never forget them
Flushin down everything, Caught up in a fuckin sting
Once more Rodney King's beatin up the fiends
Cause the fiends keep tellin and they make it hard to sling
See I'm a hustler, So you know I gotta do my thing
I don't play corners, I don't move until my phone ring
Vring-Vring, Wooo, It sounds like money
The black bag boys fuck the duffle bag money
I'll catch ya movin bricks when it's dark till it's sunny
I gotta think rich cause if not I'll stay bummy
And I like to stay fresh, It's T.M.F.
Operation number like the I.R.S., Get fresh, And get checks

[Kryme Life]
Yeah, Get fresh nigga, Progress to impress nigga
Get paid, Don't settle for less nigga, Word up, Yo
They say time's movin slow, But I say it's movin fast
I'm still in the lab shovin crack in these bags
Posted on the Ave., Throwin back Corona's
On the same corners, What a slow drag
I throw my headphones on, Open up my pad
The beat say go then I start to move fast
Zone'n, Rap potent, Nigga take a blast
Kryme you can't clone him, These niggas is trash
I pick my microphone up, Start actin bad
I do it cause I'm drivin they just do it for a fad
Huh, I just laugh take aim and go, It's gung ho
It aint a game niggas know the name, T.M.F.
The niggas with the meanest flow
We throw, Scrap that, Shake that, Clean the dope
We in the flesh, The next big thing to blow
Just cut the check, If you aint got mine I'm at your neck
Pfft, But all do respect, We got next nigga
Progress to impress nigga
Get paid, Never settle for less nigga, Word up

We came a long way from little sceam and triple beam dreams
Uh huh, Doin big things, Equip with a mean team, Yeah
Grindin, Headline'n, Diamonds that bling, I'm shine'n
Doin that work, I put mine in
New York state of mind, Nigga I think Kryme
Put me in front of mountains, Baby I'm gone climb
Any which way to make a buck on time
I'm on it, Always on the front line

[Tommy Whispers]
Ayo Kryme you cook it, I'll chop it, We bag it
I'll custom, Lets dust em, We don't fuck with faggots
Ratchets like cell phones, They stay on the hip
One call from the clip and I'm lettin her rip
Chip stackers, We don't spend a cent on a bitch
Cause, Ninety percent all she gettin is dick
Mr. Whisp keep em rollin like a forty lot six
Somethin only I get, Cause you aint from my strip
Stapleton Projects, The most infamous
On Staten Isle borough, And any district
We get it in with

[Outro: Tommy Whispers]
Yeah, Tomma-Hawk, Kryme Life, Unspoken
Another dose of that rawness-rawness
