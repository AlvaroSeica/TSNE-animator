[Intro - Chamillionaire - talking] (Bobby Valentino)
Yeahhh, (I'm poppin bottles of Patrón), poppin bottles of Patrón
(All night long), Chamillionaire, Bobby V., we in VIP
(It's on, yeah, it's on, it's on), haha, Chamillitary mayne

[Chorus - Bobby Valentino]
I don't normally drink but tonight I'm gone
Gone off that Rosay, gone off that Patrón - I'm so gone (baby)
I'm tryin to wash my problems away (eww, just for the day)
Had too much to drink, I won't say I'm drunk
But I think I drank a little too much Patrón - I'm so gone (baby)
I'm tryin to wash my problems away (eww, just for the day)

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Yeah, you might say I'm such a flirt, lipstick on my neck and shirt
Chicks all up in VIP, on my neck like it's dessert (hey!)
Said I was at work and that's really where I was at first
Now I'm out with her and she tryin to make my pockets hurt (hey!)
Any drink that you prefer (yeah), any drink that you prefer (yeah)
Knew that that would work, been a playa ever since my birth
Money is a curse but I always chase the money first
Wonder why these girls, keep on askin what my necklace worth (yeah)
Made a bunch of money (hey!), gotta lot of cars
Gotta lot of groupies (hey!), that wanna be involved
I could have 'em all but my life ain't gonna change
'Cause my problems still around the corner waitin
I put my city on, now my money long (hey!)
Mayne I should of known, my haters would of grown
And no I normally don't (don't) but tonight I need a drink
So I'm in the club like "what you drinkin?"

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire - singing]
You might say I'm such a flirt, lipstick on my neck and shirt
Chicks all up in VIP, dancin in they mini skirts (hey!)
Lookin at them curves, baddest woman in the universe
I'm just tellin her, I need you to be my passenger (hey!)
Haters gettin on my nerves (ye-yeah), haters gettin on my nerves (ye-yeah)
Man they better learn, they gon' always get what they deserve
Money is a curse but not havin money is the worst
I'll get back to work but I'm 'bout to sip this Henny first

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire - rapping]
Ye-yeah, said it ain't trickin if you could spend it
I'm a run out of dough in a minute
Every chick sayin she independent
Starin at the diamonds all in my pendent, I'm not offended
Still tryin to find out what her friend is
She tryin to find out where my Benz is
I'm so glad I got attendant (woo!)
It's time to get it
Tell me when the last time that you've been with
A playa this cool, I bet he isn't
All eyes on me like a witness (yeah!)
Told her I didn't drink and yeah I really meant it
But everybody's all up in my business
And I'm hopin this Henny help me forget it

[Chorus]

[Outro - Chamillionaire - talking] (Bobby Valentino)
Yeah
(Croooown), Crown Royal (Royal and Pattttrón) and Patrón
You know it's on (I'm so gone)
I promise you I go back to doin what I do tomorrow
But I got bills, I got stress and this buzz is (just for the day)
(Croooown), Chamillitary mayne, (Royal and Pattttrón)
Uh, it's goin down
(I'm so gone), I'm so gone right now, feelin so good, so great
But this buzz I got is really (just for the day)</pre>
