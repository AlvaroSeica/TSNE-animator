Jehovah Elkaborge
A.k.a. the God of war, God of flesh
Who could tear you to pieces like carnivores
The blessed, majestic one who's glorious
Was known to other nations as notorious
Cause of His terrible acts
Battles didn't last a half a days length
Not the way the Lord God parade strength
It didn't make sense
