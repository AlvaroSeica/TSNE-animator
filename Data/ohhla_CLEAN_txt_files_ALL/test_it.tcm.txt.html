[Prelude]
Yeah.  The concoction (stir it up)
The Ambassador, The Phanatic, The Gift (Heaven's Mentality)
So all those who believe
What they believe come put it on the table
Know what I'm sayin', don't be scared let's test it

[Tonic]
Very superstitious
and everybody wants three wishes
from a Genie or a religious eenie meenie minie moe
pick a psychic flow
you say they're on point 'cause they told you 'bout your big toe
You say "How would they know I had a bunion?"
Told you to take coins and stuff 'em in an onion
then put 'em in a shoe box up in the attic
But make sure that the floor is quadratic
Man I had it clear up to my brain cabinet
You better beware of this witchcraft habit
Can this carry you across sin's chasm?
Well if not then it's all just a phantasm
leadin' you into a very real fantasia
Razor tongues cut deep but you can't feel it 'cause ya' numb man
even those in the fam lookin' for more than the words of the Son
tryin' to have fun
sayin': "God told me this" "The Lord told me that"
But if it ain't confirmed in the Word it ain't fact
But some still continue and I think it's sick
'cause back in the day they would'a had to catch a brick!

[Chorus]
If it's blessed then come manifest it
Bring it down let's test it
If it's blessed then come manifest it
Bring it down let's test it
'Cause this is only a test it's only a test
So if you're gonna bring it then you better bring your best
'Cause anything less might burn in the fire
Come-come let's test it

[The Phanatik]
Come grab your test paper from the teacher
slash preacher
without the collar
not schemin' dollars
and won't even scream and holler
'less the track's on
But even when I'm subtle
you'll still get your bubble blown
if you're out rebuttal known facts about Messiah
Invite me to your huddle zone even to your cypha'
Come let us reason
if there's a God Â­- let's figure out how to please Him
and if He's dead we'll go ahead like we don't need Him
It sounds strange but tell me who do you believe in
See, since we got our pardon from the Garden of Eden
and pulled a treason
there's been some confusion
about who's really real and who's the illusion
Is this thing based on skin pigmentation?
Is God just a figment of imagination
'cause we can't trace Him?  Is it the other way around?
Is man the figment?  Do we even weigh a pound?
Do we hold weight as we rotate on our axis?
Who's world is this?  I've been dying to ask this
We can't help what we are
Can't change our future by clickin' heels or wishin' on lucky stars
We need a change but whose got the method
You think you do put it on the table we'll test it
You can test ours matter-fact we suggest it
You won't be let down by the King, Mr. Majestic
The Son of God one of a wide selection
But who else has a check in the column for resurrection?

[Chorus]

Ya!  It ain't over yet.  The Ambassor!  Last but not least
More than that chief.  Come and represent and let's test it!

[The Ambassador]
We're informed that when the phat track's on
crews and packs form and swarm
to hear the next man get his rap on
Leavin' God out, that's norm, but that's gone
'cause we step down to give Jesus the platform
We put Him back on the map - long live this
Triune Squad, the real God not the Wizard of Oz
Nah, the real God with total mastery
with the capacity to speak a decree and it has to be
As for me, I'm lovin' this truth and ruggedness
We sing to the King of the Theocratic Government
We're brothers sent, never hesitant to represent
heaven the fly way, YAHWEH's resident
The opinions don't vary
in heaven it's all about the slain Lamb not the tooth fairy
Santa Claus, mother nature, rabbit paws
father time, luck, the man upstairs, that all had to fall
We exalt the Savior, Mr. Fix It
the Living Water, with more flavor than Mystic
I know statistics don't create optimistic
odds for God but He won't fade He's not lipstick
It's prime time for divine glory to shine
He says "Victory is Mine"
Man's wise, but only in another man's eyes
The God-Man lies and waits for a man when a man dies
And that's a fact comin' at you, don't let that catch you
Christ died you no longer have to
My suggestion is there be no more 'fessin' or guessin'
bring it to the front for the testin'

[Extended Chorus]
Well if it's blessed then come manifest it
Bring it down let's test it
I said if it's blessed then come manifest it
Bring it down let's test it
'Cause this is only a test it's only a test
If you're gonna bring it then you better bring your best
'Cause anything less might burn in the fire
Come-come let's test it
This is only a test it's only a test
So if you're gonna bring it then you better bring your best
'Cause anything less might burn in the fire
Come-come let's test it
Betcha' know how we do this it's the Movement

Heaven's Mentality, Heaven's Mentality-tality</pre>
