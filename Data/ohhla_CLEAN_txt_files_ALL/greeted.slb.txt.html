[Chorus - Trae]
Get greeted with heat - better beat ya feet
these teflon bullets might make you weak
K shots might whoop a nigga across the street
so it's SK bitch till I rest in peace

[Verse 1 - Boss]
I make niggas hop out they slacks and hop in some khaks
Lil'Boss Hogg bitch you know I'm ridin with Lacs
not that time that spitt game, that time that spitt flame
spitt flames in niggas brains make 'em switch lanes
bang - bang ya hood, bang for change
broke gangsta's better just stay up outta my range
niggas get strange when money ain't long
I see all of these hoe niggas singin the same song
I floss flippin that gray and black Lac chrome
Jay ridin Impala and Ro done just came home
I got niggas on the C - block, homies on the B - block
my niggas from the tree tops - whoop niggas to the street top

[Verse 2 - Jay'Ton]
I stay heated in case a bitch nigga wanna get greeted
by the South Klique with AK's creepin my city
ain't no need for no conversation why you tuckin yo tail
I had a feelin you a mark bitch you tell me that frail
street sweeper - K's and glocks to heat ya block
I promise I really am gangsta you niggas are not
self explanatory so niggas know what it is
a quick shot to the dome might show you the biz
a marcharian with [?] might come to ya kids
for you snitchin my niggas locked up doin biz
a right jam might lead to me gettin you slid
dump ya body in a bucket slidin off on my rims

[Chorus - Boss/Jay'Ton Repeat 2x]
Get greeted with heat - better beat ya feet
these teflon bullets might make you weak
K shots might flip a nigga across the street
and it's SK bitch till I rest in peace

[Verse 3]
Everytime I pass a church I cross my chest
never know when them bullets might cross my chest
cause when boys got K's might as well toss ya vest
I'm a vulture rich nigga I fly out on the West
I never talk with no guns - you niggas walk with no guns
come here and get chalked with no guns
I ain't the one they can't beat me
capital J dot capital D - O - E
like a man with no hands I can't hold my piece
like the back grocery store a nigga stay with beats
Michael D, the boss H - O - G - G...S - L - A - B with the S dub C

[Verse 4 - Boss]
South West bitch nigga better cover and duck
cause K shots hittin niggas makin boys do tucks
I'm tellin you cuz this here I got'll dangle ya thighs
and have you wonderin why the fuck you had to come outside
so back back homie before ya grill get cracked
by the mac in the Lac when I start to attack
cause I'm a gangsta chump ass niggas'll get lost
greeted and heated with the pistol, Nina Ross
paint gloss, glass house sittin on some deep dishes
fuckin with Jay ya body floatin with the fishes
like gators steadily dumpin chumps in swamps
when I pull out the pump and dump bitch niggas dump

[Chorus - Boss/Jay'Ton Repeat 2x]
Get greeted with heat - better beat ya feet
these teflon bullets might make you weak
K shots might flip a nigga across the street
and it's SK bitch till I rest in peace</pre>
