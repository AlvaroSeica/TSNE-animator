[Magic] 
Do what you do ma 
I see ya-see ya-see ya, do what you do ma 
I see ya-see ya acting bad, acting bad ain't ya 
I see ya-see ya acting bad, acting bad ain't ya (uh-huh) 

[Chorus - 2x] 
You got some groove in your move ma 
I like it-like it, when you do what you do man 
Just let me-let me knock it down, knock it down for ya 
Just let me-let me knock it down, knock it down for ya (uh-huh) 

[Magic] 
You see me in the daytime, with a flashlight 
I'm trying to find that pussy, cause that's the only pussy feel right 
I lose sleep, trying to find that 
Dime piece she the shit, where that ass at 
I ain't gon' lie, I'm in love with that badunkadunka 
Hair sweet, want some chocolate from Willy Wonka don't ya 
Now I'm ready for that jelly, I could see ya now 
Just a bouncing on my belly, getting me all sweaty 
We can do what you wanna do 
Don't be ashamed, do a dance for me in the nude 
Am I confused, cause I thought you was in need of freaking 
I'm a freak, and we can do this every other weekend is you with me 

[Chorus - 2x] 

[Magic] 
See you're a fool, when you drop it low 
I'm rock hard, tell your friends that you gotta go 
You gotta leave, you about to get a touch of Magic 
Seen a special man, special man gon' let you have it 
Keep on twisting, and twerking the cat 
Make it good, and I promise I'm calling you back 
I ain't gon' lie, I ain't looking for what's in your eyes 
The beauty lies, smack dab in between your thighs 
To tell the truth, see I'm looking for a thug ma 
Let me knock it down, in the corner of the club ma 
I got it bad, want it bad let me knock it loose 
Your shit is popped, let me fix it with the proper tools 

[Chorus - 2x] 

[Magic] 

Do what you do ma 
I see ya-see ya-see ya, do what you do ma 
I see ya-see ya acting bad, acting bad ain't ya 
I see ya-see ya acting bad, acting bad ain't ya - 2x</pre>
