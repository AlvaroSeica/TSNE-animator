the plb just flow for the waters and
all the seeds that we grow for the harvest and
the energy that we owe to the goddess and
twenty three's gonna blow out the oxygen

frolic in the stardust. cosmic trigger figure eight.
afterthought continental drift disintegrate
the transcendental pangea idealism
sacred brain technique of splitting hemispheres into
precise aneurysm duplicates. hallucinogens.
the double butterfly alumni julia sets.
doppelganger hybrid nexus 
you wont soon forget this psuedonym baffoon
who be breaking off semantic branches

reiterate data and vedic integrity
ready for whatever penalty buries me
under the canopy channeling anarchy
family vanishing
panacea

sundial piledriver pine needle
my pineal gland reaches a pleidian apex
and shaggy parasols are now available 
to charm and protect the lackadaisical phrazes
back to basics enveloping cool and continuous
eucalyptus alphanumeric tantric nucleosynthesis
ruin your business' and drop a jewel thats paranormal
the cypher of a fool is still a perfect circle
black halo. cats cradle. galileo tap the maple syrup
and errupt like a volcano
archangel whether in the temple or the stargate
i'm like saw palmetto up in hiphop's prostate
fabulous. throwing out the leaflets and zines
to feed the memes of the motormouth elohim. catalyst.
seeding the ionic nanobot enzymes and
sending a quark up into the windchimes

reiterate data and vedic integrity
ready for whatever penalty buries me
under the canopy channeling anarchy
family vanishing
panacea

the plb just flow for the waters and
all the seeds that we grow for the harvest and
the energy that we owe to the goddess and
twenty three's gonna blow out the oxygen

silhouette. syrian rue. sewer grate mildew twenty three skidoo
its like i'm an igloo and you're a barbecue
a motley crue just a hollering in solitude
now i'm bleeding out of my brain
from the loudness of the treble
in a theatre of pain
where you shout at the devil
take it down a notch and face the bass speaker
my grandpa always told me stolen watermellon tastes sweeter
and that nebacanezer straight blessed the fresh water
property is theft so theft is proper
bring death to order and the jailed dispairing frail image
that pales in comparison to a failed marriage
hail eris and the operatic attraction of biofeedback
samizdat on a high wire trapeze act
aphrodesiac samizdatura hurricane
nurturing inertia yes the words are purified in flames
and braided from the same chaos tape
the plague language brainwashed naked ape
braided from the same chaos tape
plague language brainwashed naked ape
its like that</pre>
