[Intro]
(It's now my privilege to introduce your main speaker...)
{*cheers, whistles, and applause*}
Hey, I'm Big K.R.I.T. and I'm a meditator (Hey!)
It wasn't easy to come in today, but.. I'm here

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear what I've done wrong
I'll deal with my problems when I get home
I'm better off when I'm all alone
I know I said I'd stop but I'm not that strong
I just wanna meditate 
(I just wanna meditate, meditate) (I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate 
(I just wanna meditate, meditate) (I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate 
(I-I-I just wanna meditate, meditate) (I-I-I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate 
(I just wanna meditate, meditate) (I-I-I-I just wanna meditate, meditate)
I just wanna meditate

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Sittin with this glass of liquor pourin out my spiritual guide
like, "Take me to the other side"
Whoever said escapin your problems with empty bottles
would only delay them 'til tomorrow, yes was surely right
But when the world said, "Fuck ya", how would you reply?
No need to whisper how you feel, this is you and I
I paint pictures of hieroglyphics compared to most rap niggaz
But I be overlooked, so I just let it slide, let it die, how can I
Be so stupid to tell you this wasn't real
Be so eager to tell ya just how I feel
But let's be honest, the real reason I'm here
To be clear, I was never the Man of Steel
I fell victim too many times to count
Too many times I've died, too many things I doubt
Not enough love in my house, my house is not enough
It's filled with pointless things and those things keep piling up
Those things'll leave you crushed if they fall
To be real I don't think you feel me at all
Can you hear me at all?... Can you steer me at all...
to the liquor store

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
How can I stop, when I'm too far gone
to get back where I came from?
I was searchin for some answers at a bar with some dancers
And I found out there really ain't none
And the bottom of my glass is just as empty as my lesson
Count it with my friends and my loved ones
All my exes hate my guts cause when I finally call them up
They know that I just wanna fuck some
I apologize... for what? I don't know
Too many times, I did it and it shows 
I feel it in my soul, there's a burning in my stomach 
And it's churning in slow, and it grows every time I hit a low
If you out, I was hopin you could roll
If you fiendin for a drank, let me po'
If you ridin, maybe we can go
Before they close to the liquor store

[Chorus]

[Outro]
So I sit here... 
and I think back on all the things I wanted in life 
and all the things that I've accomplished
I'm more fulfilled then I ever have been before
I still lose and I'v-I've still lost, but I love, and I'm living
There's nothing better in this world than to be for sure
And I'm sure - I'm sure enough in what I do, and how I do it
There's a lot of people around me that believe in me
And I depend on them, to see me through this - this life of mine 
Let's hope this journey that we take
All these moves that we make
are the right ones, while I meditate</pre>
