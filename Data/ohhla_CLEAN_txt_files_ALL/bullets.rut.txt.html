[Iron Mic]
They let me out the chamber, nigga your life's in danger
We aim at innocent bystanders, we hitting strangers
My guns are Ruthless, the bullets, the Bastard
Truck, Beno, Bless and Iron, we coming for ya ass bitch
You better duck, cuz when we dumping, we ain't letting up
Let the beretta pump, paramedics'll pick 'em up
Only the strong survive, cowards'll die
I'm like bullets from that 2-5, I spread out inside
I'm the reason all them gangsta niggas say that they ride
I don't like fucking with niggas that got drama and hide
I'd rather be in a shootout where it's cold outside
I'd rather, rip through your flesh, shit I've been through a mess
In a hood, I'm a factor, it's life or death

[Truck]
Aiyo, I'm hot right now, check how I jump out the barrel
Right through your back, nigga, crack ya bone marrow
I'm made from the lead, and stuffed with gun powder
A hundred niggas dead cuz of me, every hour
And I'm only a bullet, blame that nigga, he pulled it
You thought that he wouldn't, and now that you got it
I know he shot straight, but I kept on turning
I hear duke screaming, yelling damn it's burner
Now I'm up inside this nigga, and surgery time
Doctor's inside this nigga
Talking bout I gotta stay up inside this nigga
In order for him, to stay alive, my nigga

[Bless]
I'm out now, everybody get the fuck down and catch a bullet
I'm like Steve Nash when I pull it
From anywhere, niggas better save ya soul
Next thing I fucked around and ricocheted off the pole
People running in the house, fucking cock and reload
I've been denying to penetrate in one of these pussies
When I enter your womb it's so soft and gushy
Why you push me, ambulance coming, I hear the sirens
Head first, dead in his chest, to stick a cop

[Beno]
Soon as I'm out the clip, somebody's getting hit
Or whips getting flipped, the artirary's getting ripped
Or bricks getting chipped, you better not slip
Or end up with a shit bag attached to your hip
I've been hiding in the drawer, waiting in the four
Ever since that day ya'll was purchased from the store
I was thrown in the box, waiting for a release date
When I come out, they hope that I keep straight
So I tell 'em, please just keep faith
And pray I don't hate you, as hard as the board
I seen men break down, front of the law
Round here they die by the bullet and not by the sword

[Apocalipps]
Yeah, die by the bullet, and not by the sword
I'm trying to hit somebody in they mouth, open and swallow
I'm all filled up with lead, and my head is hollow
Off we go, first out to battle with a vengeance
I don't know how it started, but I know how it's gon' finish
People running fash, dred dropped his bottle of Guinness
It come right on yo ass, you better work them tennis
That nigga I'm suppose to hit yo, he right in my range
But my owner that got the gun, the muthafucka can't aim
But I'm thirsty to pop a top, Energizer bunny
I introduce 'em to the Duracell copper top
A hundred miles an hour, of burning hot
I hit flesh, now I'm in this little kid's knot
He had a football, his skull laying half on the canvas
And it's sad, cuz shorty could of been the next Barry Sanders</pre>
