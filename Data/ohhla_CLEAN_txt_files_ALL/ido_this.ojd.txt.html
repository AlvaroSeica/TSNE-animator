[Pre-Chorus]
Turn us off in the hood, nigga I do this
If you think I'm whipin nigga you stupid
Run out the 2 door so I feel coupish
Cali girl brain but she go so stupid

[Chorus]
Turn this off in the hard, nigga I do this
Dealing low on track, we got struck by cupid
Retarded in pocket cause my trap go stupid
BBM 3D imax movie
Counting up the bands, nigga I do this
Money in your bands, nigga I do this
Run turn the bands, nigga I do this
Running through the bands, nigga I do this

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn us off in the hood, nigga I do this
If you think I'm whipin nigga you stupid
Run out the 2 door so I feel coupish
Cali girl brain but she go so stupid

[Chorus]
Turn this off in the hard, nigga I do this
Dealing low on track, we got struck by cupid
Retarded in pocket cause my trap go stupid
BBM 3D imax movie
Counting up the bands, nigga I do this
Money in your bands, nigga I do this
Run turn the bands, nigga I do this
Running through the bands, nigga I do this

[Chorus]
Turn this off in the hard, nigga I do this
Dealing low on track, we got struck by cupid
Retarded in pocket cause my trap go stupid

Counting up the bands, nigga I do this
Money in your bands, nigga I do this
Run turn the bands, nigga I do this
Running through the bands, nigga I do this

[Verse]
Money in your bands, nigga I do this
Been here I'm just chilling almost strucking for a sushi
Texico shawty but my diamonds so fruity
Get your 3D glasses go and finna make a movie
Running through these bands 'cause you know I'm quick to lose it
Home depot guns I got whole kind of toolies
All kind of cars I don't long no roofing
Why you wear this green steel, nigga I got roofies

[Chorus]
Turn this off in the hard, nigga I do this
Dealing low on track, we got struck by cupid
Retarded in pocket cause my trap go stupid
BBM 3D imax movie
Counting up the bands, nigga I do this
Money in your bands, nigga I do this
Run turn the bands, nigga I do this
Running through the bands, nigga I do this</pre>
