[Saul Williams - singing]
I, am a simple man
I don't ask for much
But an angel's touch
Touching where wings should be
You swoop down for me
Come to rescue me
I'm holding on, to youuuuuuuuu
My search for love, is through ohh!
Oooh-oh, ooh-ohhh {*10X*}

[Saul Williams - singing]
Love is a diagram
Sine wave in the sand
Carved by nature's hand
Crutches where wings should be
You swoop down for me
Come to rescue me
I'm holding on, to youuuuuuuuu
My search for love, is through ohh!
Oooh-oh, ooh-ohhh {*10X*}

Time has taught me so much about you
You're all I know
Find me in the deepest parts of you
Oooh-oh, ooh-ohhh

Oooh-oh, ooh-ohhh {*10X*}</pre>
