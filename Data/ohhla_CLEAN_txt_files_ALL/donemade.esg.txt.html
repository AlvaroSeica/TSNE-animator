Now I lay me, down and sleep
And I pray to the Lord, for my soul to keep
But if I should die, before I wake
Pray to the Lord, my soul to take (pray to the Lord, my soul to take)

[E.S.G.]
It's fucked up, how the street life is
Murder after murder, ain't no hope for the kids
Nothing but bad influences, all the role models gone
Can't look to the parents, cause they ain't home
How many grandmothers you'll see, with lil' kids at the sto'
Daddy gone on sherms, his mama gone on blow
Fell through that crack befo', but I had to climb back out
No mo' dumb shit for me, I had to straighten my life back out
Now I'm stronger than ever, mo' focused and willing
Why these other bitch niggaz, switch for a half-a-million
And sell they soul, and spread lies on your names
Scared cause you might, take a lil' of they fame
But homie fuck my change, fuck these cars and clothes
24's and low-pros, sold out shows and hoes
Cause when the casket close, and you breathe your last breath
All material shit is gone, nothing but real family left g'yeah

[Hook: Lloyd]
Me and my niggaz ride
Even when the sun don't shine, and its cold outside
I never run in or hide, cause some niggaz hate it
But I can't get faded, cause I done made it
Steady struggle and strive
Find my way, out these ghetto streets of mine
This is coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
We all walk back in line (yeah)

[E.S.G.]
If a nigga snitch on you, (I'll ride for that)
Pull a gun and don't shoot, you might (die from that)
Come up short with my money, (I might let you make it)
Fuck with me or my family, your life I'll take it
Niggaz'll try to fuck your bitch, behind your back
Then say he got love, and talk behind your back
Me and my homie caught a weed case, (on the Boulevard)
But I was on probation, (and he ain't take his charge)
Wishing I could ask the Lord, (why it be that way mayn)
When you help these niggaz out, they don't appreciate it mayn
That go for any nigga, a friend or foe
You try to play me like a hoe, you tongue kiss the 4-4
But is that contradiction, (cause you can take it how you wanna)
Like that TV show The Wire, (I'ma fight for my corners)
Trying to build up my team, so we well connected
Don't feel E.S.G. or Sin, bitch niggaz better exit g'yeah
