[Heavy D]
Yo, the mansion is just the extension of the pain
The hallways echo when I holler her name
I swallowed the pride, hollowed the fame
Narrow the lane so she could play the game alone
Nowadays, don't even answer the phone
and lately, yo she don't even come home
My baby, don't act the same no mo'
It's like the game rearrange and things done changed (yes yes y'all)
Strange, strange...

It was over before it was over
But now I'm right back where I started - alone again
Feelin empty and brokenhearted
No matter what I do, still missing you
Lately you do things you never used to
Instead of listening, you turn around and walk away
Your side of the bed, is getting cold
Coming home late, it's gettin old
I guess there's nothing left to do
(Missing you girl)

[Chorus: Heavy D] (Carl Thomas)
How do you give up a love like that?
How do you give up a love so fast?
(I'm missing you, I'm still missing you girl)
How do you give up a love like that?
How do you give up a love so fast?
(I'm missing you, I'm still missing you girl)
Yes yes y'all

[Heavy D]
You used to text me, "I'll be over" (Ooh yeaa-aa-aah!)
But nowadays the sex seems like the same ol' thang - mundane thang
To say I love you feels like I'm choking~!
But I rather walk away, and love you just the same

[Chorus]

[Heavy D]
Yo, what happened to the good ol' days? The hood ol' days?
Used to draw the shade, lay in bed, play all day
Callin work sick, stay home all day
Now I'm alone all day, while you gone all day
Roamin the street 'til we don't even speak all day
And I'm buggin like what happened to her loving ways?
It's like I'm in a drugged-out daze or a bugged-out maze
Mami ain't the same and it's a shame

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Carl Thomas]
I'm missing you, I'm still missing you girl
I'm missing you (I'm missing you)
I'm missing you (I'm missing you)</pre>
