[Intro] [Bishop Lamont talking]
Good lookin' Focus. I'm gonna make this masterpiece theater
You got me Drop? I know you tapin'
So anyway, welcome ladies and gentlemen
Bitches and bitch ass niggas and bitch ass bitches. Haha
I know niggas been wonderin' what's been goin' on and shit
So, I'm just gonna put you up on some things
since I got the deal and what's been goin' on and shit
You know what I mean? I've been seeing so much been hearing so much
I'm just gonna go address some of this
Take this adventure with me. Buckle up!

[Verse One]
I swear to God almost every fuckin' day
Another fake ass nigga talk up to me, guess what he say?
"Hey Bishop. How's it feel to work with Dr. Dre?"
I reply, "Hey faggot how's it feel to be gay?"
Now beat it bitch, go blow a dick, get out of my face
For the thousandth fuckin' time that ain't me on Myspace
I ain't got no time for no Internet surfin'
Nigga I'm workin'
Wanna ask me somethin' 
Better tell me in person
Fuck that page
I put that shit to an end
Just cause you put your picture on there, we ain't friends
Warren my nigga
Crooked my nigga
Taje my nigga
Mike A my nigga
Dae One my nigga
Fuck
You get the point
You friends with Chevy, not me
Speakin' of producers
Some of these bitch
Used to front now they all on my dick

[Chorus]
Hell, you might as well
Cut up your bed sheets
Cut holes in the pillow case
Put it on and hit the streets
Or burn a cross by my church
God damn bitch niggas
I didn't know you was some Klan members
Hell, you might as well
Wear a swastika 
Cut your hair, go bald, become a skin head
Sell some Snapple get a rope and go hang a nigga
Hatin' sons of bitches
Y'all some Klan members

[Verse Two]
A lot of singers wanna rap now
You didn't stop me, nigga shot me in my back like bloaw
Baby boy I wasn't playin' no games
I really trusted ya, had love for ya, now I'm Ving Rhames
My nigga Russell know, so I ain't trippin' yo
Plus Poppa Black put me up on Game long time ago
Guerrilla Black, he and me go way back
So all that whisperin' to him 'bout me, you can save that
Divide and conquer that's older than Contra
We family, so bitch here's a word from our sponsor 
Weeee killer
Bitch get your mind right
Bitch get your rhymes tight
I see haters are plenty
In the beginning I was mine
But hindsight is 20/20
Gossipin' bitches
Y'all better gang way
And stop callin' me 'bout what you heard Game say

[Chorus]
Hell, you might as well
Cut up your bed sheets
Cut holes in the pillow case
Put it on and hit the streets
Or burn a cross by my church
God damn bitch niggas
I didn't know you was some Klan members
Hell, you might as well
Wear a swastika 
Cut your hair, go bald, become a skin head
Sell some Snapple get a rope and go hang a nigga
Hatin' sons of bitches
Y'all some Klan members

[Verse Three]
If I don't like you, I don't like you
I guarantee if that's how I'm feelin', you gave me every right to
Cause ordinarily
I'm a cool ass dude
Ask any real nigga round, he'll tell you the truth
And nothin' but the truth like my nigga Young Dre
G. Malone, Mystro, E. Whyte and Malay
Big Wide, Jack Bomb, Chuck Taylor, Strong Arm
Wide Beat, Camo, Pr1me, the list goes on and on
Alright, enough of that, let's get back to the song
Sticks and stones break bones but clown dances never hurt me
Listen
I ain't trippin' off dude
If I had a real problem I would have came and seen you
Homie
Come on, let's think back
Power 106, nothin' but love, I gave you dap
You was low key dissin' me, what the fuck is that?
But I ain't mad
I still like how you rap

[Chorus]
Hell, you might as well
Cut up your bed sheets
Cut holes in the pillow case
Put it on and hit the streets
Or burn a cross by my church
God damn bitch niggas
I didn't know you was some Klan members
Hell, you might as well
Wear a swastika 
Cut your hair, go bald, become a skin head
Sell some Snapple get a rope and go hang a nigga
Hatin' sons of bitches
Y'all some Klan members

[Outro] [Bishop talking]
Church. Had to testify to the truth. The truth and nothin' but
Niggas comin' sideways at me. If it's really a problem, it's a problem
Holla at me man. But I forgive you. Amen</pre>
