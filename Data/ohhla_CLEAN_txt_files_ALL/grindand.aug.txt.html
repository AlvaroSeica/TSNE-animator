[Chorus: August Alsina]
As I lay me down too sleep
I pray to lord my soul too keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray to lord my soul too take

[August Alsina]
My cup full I'm laid back, I'm bout mine you know that
I'm rag racing, zoom zoom, in a rush too get all that
Cross my heart, I die hard, throw your hood in all black
If you real your recognize

[Chorus: August Alsina]
All I do is grind, riding through the streets all day
All I do is grind, riding through these streets all day</pre>
