[Verse 1: Mykill Miers]
Yo, some people change like the season change
you can be type o' brothers to do different thangs
then they wanna question always sweatin' you
they sayin' you actin' funny and they pest from you
they testin' you like you ain't be true
but the lessons by they else tellin' when I do
so my question to you, you my homie from jump street
cause soon as tump speak you down to rush me
so must react like we enemies
are you a friend of me, droppin of negative energy
you pretend to be friends with me
but eventually the truth come and the in you see
you potentially play the double agent goin' back and forth
is a whole lot of trouble ain't it ?
so now we gain beats and we don't speak
you blame your punk-ass homies when the rumours leak

[Chorus]
Yo, we worked from homies to haters, from friends to foes
You got the wrong (?) from niggas you know
But on the low, I know your heart's filled with anger
So how did we go from best friends to strangers?
(scratched: "mama said you behind my back be talking trash")
(sample: "A thug changes and love changes, and best friends become strangers")

[Verse 2: Mykill Miers]
Are you a friend or foe?
you acting like a bitch-nigga though
And I can't figure your attitude
I ain't mad at you
you don't know your mommy 's asked for you
what happened to me and you bein' down
when you was clown
she known that we was peep
we would never gotten to it
let your homie talk better 'bout me man you blew it
this thangs you do is the same thing that hoes do
get mad at minor things when they exposed to
this is what I'm gon' do
I'm about the shakers
I ain't got time for a homie that's flate
cause a homie that's a fake is a homie that's a snake
you best to back out my face and give me some space
this type of rap race you gotta get the keys
you better get on your camp partner before they squeeze
the homie that's a enemie is a bad predictment
so make sure you buck your fake homies you can't live with

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mykill Miers]
Some times I wake up and think about the people who hate it
I see things in low clippin' now that I've made it to 25
You out there you tellin' lies
actin' like my true homie but you wear the skies
got a whole lot to say when my back is turned
but when we face face try to act concerned
you asking me thangs tight when your eye will drop
knowing damn well that you cats tryin' to plot
you don't care about my whereabouts
just run your mouth
knowing that you thinking about ways to take me out
so if you hate me, then just hate me
but don't try to play me for a fool and try to thank me
maybe if you was man enough then you would let me know
instead of lettin everybody know on the low
See most of y'all is two-faced
That's why I walk around with a damn screw face

[Chorus]</pre>
