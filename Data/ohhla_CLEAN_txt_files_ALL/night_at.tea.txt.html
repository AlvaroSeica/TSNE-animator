[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Esta loca... wepa...

[Dom Pachino]
That's when I walked in the spot
Jewelry swingin' and blingin', plus the window was hot
That's when I knew it was on
Said 'what up' to the DJ, he was spinning my song
We partying tonight
Attitude's at the door, and I'm feeling aight
And I'm spending money out of sight
For all the times I didn't have it, and I didn't feel right
Finally got my shit together
Got a house, copped a floater and brand new beretta
And it's a brand new endeavor
I got brand new music that's brand new cheddar
And I don't feel no one can do it better
If they can, show and prove, that they can do it better
It's not about talking shit
It's about walking your dogs, if your thoughts was sick
I wanna fortress, like a sorceress
Plus a boxer Porsche, that's swift...</pre>
