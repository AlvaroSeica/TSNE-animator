Get ready its heavy
Its deadly its 70's
80's 90's relevant
Ever since heaven sent
Evidence better men
Lettem in
Better get etiquette
Stepping in my city
Crack right up the block from the president
Smell it as soon as you step in it
(you smell that shit?) yup there it is
the block is a mother
Thats surrogate parents get
Overshadowed by arrogant
Concrete blvd avenues terraces
Howard you to the home of the terrapins
Never get shit twisted
Cuz it will be off with your head and it
Wont be easy tryna put on your head again
You gon feel this
Killers guerrillas
We the trillest
The villains
The sickest
They said that I couldn't
But look at the way that I did it
The picture we painted bout life
Comin up right here in the district
We made it kool for k dot to do what he do
Oddisee better than Kanye too
real dc nigga not that other shit
Before rap was in the trap my gun was the publicist
After alpo you couldn't come to my city
And you ain't know who wayne perry was before jay said it
With one album we went to number 1 in the city
we functionally dysfunctional you let them tell it
Oh I know you ain't think the brothers were thru
Fuck it we better than all y'all 2
Call y'all crew trap rap thats all y'all do
This mac n my back pack
Will make you call out truce
This what they wanted... uppercuts to they stomach
yup yo ass get busted on the mic whenever we touch it
Look what them suckas loving that shit that ain't sayin nuffin
Haha I get to chuckling like fuck em we way above em
Somethin comin wit that substance &amp; crushin and that's how we does it
Do this rulers you foolish we finish fellas for fronting
I'm from where dollars are printed
And many monuments in it
Senate be signing shit that determine how we be living
And if you bullshitting, they gettin yo paper properly like monopoly
So if you don't save up neighbor, wake up you got to leave
Potna if you do not agree then have alotta cheese
Or else it is officer please take these cuff off of me
The talk is cheap, less lippin, better we all would be
Listen if the Diamond District is what y'all want to see
We stalk the beat so awkwardly, like all of dem raw emcees
So What up, put an apostrophe after the awesome three
Prodigal sons of the city returning
from the ashes where we rose when the city was burning
from the riots in the streets to the streets that be quite
the city's ours, you don't believe me
come meet me &amp; try it
I know y'all mad that a nigga from the county be repping
the entire city I do it better without a question
if you don't like it, I'm sorry you niggas sorry
&amp; my shit is absolute &amp; you prolly
aye, let me kill these niggas mo
let me dig these ditches mo
let burn these bridges mo, I don't need these niggas mo
something they already though, so they say that we cool
you don't fuck with me, my nigga I don't fuck with you
don't try to be difficult, go on step aside
Diamond District's the crew &amp; for the city we provide
taking it international</pre>
