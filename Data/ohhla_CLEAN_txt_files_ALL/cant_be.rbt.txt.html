[Lawyer]
Your honor, the defendant was arrested without a license
in a car containing three concealed weapons and over an ounce of marijuana

[Judge]
Well, council, if your client insists on pleading the fifth
I'll have no choice but to throw the book at him
How do you want to proceed?

{*Chop Master Onion pulls out a boombox*}

[Judge]
Order!

[Chop Master Onion]
Kick! Punch! We don't have much time
If you don't squeal you're gonna serve a dime
I'm fine either way 'cause I still get paid
But listen to your teacher, this should be your next play
Now snitch!

[PaRappa] Snitch?
[Onion] Rat! Rat!
[PaRappa] Rat? Rat?
[Onion] Snitch! Snitch! Rat!
[PaRappa] Snitch? Snitch? Rat?
[Onion] Rat! Rat! Snitch!
[PaRappa] Rat? Rat? Snitch?

[Chop Master Onion]
Don't be a hero when you could serve zero
Or do you want to shower with some butch bull queero?

[PaRappa the Rapper]
I may be a rapper but I can't take this rap
Wasn't driving the car, I was chillin in the back
It was King Kong Mushi with the drugs behind the wheel
If it keeps my culo safe, bet your ass I'm gonna squeal

[Lawyer]
This is absurd! He wants to throw us off the scent

[Onion]
Your honor, I've prepared a plea agreement

[PaRappa the Rapper]
It can't be a crime just to kick a dope rhyme!

[Judge]
Good point talking dog, I'll set you free with served time

[PaRappa the Rapper]
Yeah! You gotta believe!

[King Kong Mushi]
You fucked up now, PaRappa! {*gunshots*}</pre>
