[Intro: Funkmaster Flex]
GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!
Yeah you know what it is!!! Funk Flex! 
Who you mad at me or yourself?!
Slaughterhouse! This is mean right here!

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
Me and you (We comin!) Yo' mama and yo' cou-sin too (It don't matter, we comin)
That hoodrat bitch that's in love, with you (Don't matter, we comin!)
We comin for 'em, you know what we do and why we do and how we do it

[Verse One: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah! I said the kids the dog, everybody dyin, no lyin
Livin the life of a serpent 
My enemies in some shit I'm rollin up in a viper the white room is perfect
Rifle dispersin, COME OUT YO' HOUSE!!!!
This is offensive minded gents against a blind defense
This reminds me of Joey checkin Consequence!!! 
(Everyone enjoy their day) I sound calm but in my mind
I'm huntin you down while you try to climb the fence
Split yo' spleen while you with yo' queen
Fuck the mood of the room I like it ain't no theme
(WOO!) Obama take away my right to bear arms
I'm puttin a sweater around the uzi I'm walkin around with it like it's my toy dog
Yo' boy ball like Augmon, augmentation take place
Often if they faceoff (WOO!)
You callin me sober so what save the shit
I'd done drink so much I don't even know what bein famous is
The difference between the d list and the a list bitch
All I know is that I'm a hop, skip and a sniff away from doin a plate of Taylor Swift
That'll be the day you haters wish, that day I'm standin up at that podium
At that Grammy show, dressed up like The Dream livin a nightmare
On Zanies, coke, and handlin mo' than God can throw upon the shoulders of an addict
I'm Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston
Wrapped up in a plastic package, my only true concern is
What am I 'gon do after rappin, maybe I'll clap yo' ass and
Just do life, 'fore I break in this new knife, all I wanted do is

[Verse Two: Joell Ortiz]
Rappity rappity rappity rappity rap that's all I'm good fo'?
Nah I was that nigga that asked you why you in my hood fo'?
You know them good folks? That's yo' cousin or yo' aunt live in that buildin?
Well then yo' uncle should've told you don't wear no gold like you just chillin
Now I'm 'gon need that chain you wearin no hard feelings 
Since I know them people you said you kinfolk to won't be no killin
Though I'm willin to leave you spillin, like oil when it fuck up drillin I'm no villian
I'm just, playin the hand I was dealt ain't none of us out here did the dealin
We all grew up in a full house, we were bored as lil' children
Straight in the projects faces flushed just finished stealin this ain't no poker face boy!
Ain't no bluffin, all that huffin and puffin for what?!
You givin up somethin either your life or all that ice you should've had tucked in
Now see back in the days the yaowa was a trapper
Scribblin raps up in my Trapper Keeper don't keep uh callin me this here rapper
I emcee, get it right, Jack Dempsey, with the right
Mayweather, with the left, Pacqueio, say good night
You don't wanna box me papi your footwork sloppy I'll knock anybody out
That ain't no punchline man I'm like Rocky
I'm a quarter of the Slaughter four fourths of a New Yorker
You know the aura, yay', fig cheese, Timbs and Chinese food orders
Ortiz

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
Me and you (We comin!) Yo' mama and yo' cou-sin too (It don't matter, we comin)
That hoodrat bitch that's in love, with you (Don't matter, we comin!)
We comin for 'em, you know what we do and why we do and how we do it (we comin!)

[Verse Three: Crooked I]
My goon levels be equal to Bean' Sigel
Shootin out of a moving vehicle from the seat of a Jeep Eagle
Then I'm switchin the Jeep Eagle, ditchin it for a cheap Regale
Come back with a street sweeper and continue to sleep people (POW!)
When I squeeze lethal shots you meet evil
Drop the street sweeper, cock the D. Eagle, pop yo' ce-rebral 
Hemisphere, the end is near, nigga the menace here
Bitches askin me if Em is here
Shit, he prob'ly playing tennis in his Lear
Rockin the diamond worth the city of Venice in his ear
While I'm gettin more chin than- Hold on, that shit is weird
I was gon' say gettin more chin than a nigga 
tryna enter the Guinness with his beard
Shady Records gettin the ladies naked usin baby effort
While you niggaz invitin hoes to your crib
Knowin yo' spot is smaller than those on a baby leopard
Get on my level, maybe never, crazy Mercedes, navy leather seats leanin
The streets fiendin, to find somebody who know about
puttin they whole family on, you'd have to meet Keenan
Wayans, bar for bar, where do I weigh in
No clue, it's Goku, I'm +Super+, I'm just sayin/Saiyan

[Verse Four: Joe Budden]
Next shit, Flex shit, right back on our shit again
Shady Street, House Gang, but they won't let us live again
Monday through Friday, so pull up in a different Benz
Just in case they thought I was losin focus nigga switch your lens
Critically acclaimed, to critically defamed
After all I done for this industry these kids should be ashamed dawg
Maybe I haven't done a thing and that's a fantasy
I'm not so offended much, gotta pardon my vanity
Wait - sometimes it's called for, you gotta get braggadocious
The only way to get the attention of those that haven't noticed
Mine the only genre that don't seem to applaud consistency
So when I say I'm nice and they know how far the distance be
... Cause to me it's undeniable
Still who they can depend on, never been unreliable
The hotter shit means nada if them dudes ain't bringin fire through
So when they make this list how could this shit be justifiable?
Jers' shit, Jers' shit, 'member me from Bentley kid?
Never went diamond but the buckets on the Bentley did
Coupe shit's my new shit cause it's somethin you should know first
Ya mixtape ain't shit if the shit ain't got a Joe verse

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
Me and you (We comin!) Yo' mama and yo' cou-sin too (It don't matter, we comin)
That hoodrat bitch that's in love, with you (Don't matter, we comin!)
We comin for 'em, you know what we do and why we do and how we do it (we comin!)</pre>
