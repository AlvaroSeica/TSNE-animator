[Intro: Bizzy]
Ha ha (get off of me!)
Yeah, worldwide, worldwide
(Get this shit off me! Layzie and Bizzy Bone)
Lil' Layzie, get these motherfuckers off me nigga!
(Hit that shit, buck buck buck!)
Yeah, c'mon young

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
I say we pistol packin, whistlin mackin, sittin with my ooh-wop-wop
That double Glock-Glock, artillery shop
Yo here we go, and low creepin out the do', blow
Rolled out of my system, emotions they comin to and fro

[Bizzy Bone]
Slow flow, speed it up, when they run up we come bustin back
Black boots, silently righteous, better get your mouth smacked
Beef like Outback, count the Roman symbol baby
Crack drink, fuck that, you know I'm a nomad
Out of the thumb with the thought of a thimble, Jesus we all
The luxuries of God in the midst of when he façades
These broads on the good dance, stunt then, front then
Bumpin this music, interview, you see me comin
Duckin the consequences, drama fences, got my pension
Workin, for the grand prize riders, tension extension extension
Roll with the Enterprise, energize, see the eyes
Quiet on the set, take flight, Mecca you blessed, right?
Until the sun come shinin, brighten up the light
Let's get wreckless, recollect, then I'll bet
We'll be cleaner then a three-piece, baby I need a queen but I'm a slave
Answer to Lil' B.B. brain, 3-D on the main vein

[Chorus]  2X w/ minor variations

[Layzie Bone]
I'm livin the story, of a young O.G., O.G.
Had to grow up quick in these streets
Some of y'all thought y'all was slicker than me
Chill as can be, I got on my mission
I stacked up my bread, y'all niggaz just listen
I'ma show you how a real G roll, keep your mind from trippin
Used to be blinded slippin, takin rippings, somehow I done made the distance
Even right now I feel resilience, always comin with somethin brilliant
Passed the millions, I'm after billions, after that I'll be chasin trillions
Wheelin and dealin, ohh what a feelin
Buildin thangs to raise the youth, carryin thangs that'll raise the roof
Cut you every which way but loose, disappear nigga, poof!
See the truth is, since Ruthless, niggaz been on some new shit
Y'all wonderin how we do this, still leavin y'all niggaz clueless
You foolish, now recognize a young lil' nigga with a +Enterprise+
I don't sympathize, don't be surprised when I crack you between yo' eyes
Size don't mean shit, 'less you talkin about my genitals
Men know, women know, there you go so here we go!

[Chorus]  2X w/ minor variations

[Bizzy Bone]
Carry the guns like Little Capo-Confuscious deep in a duffle bag
Sleepin on the side of the building of Gambini's broad's pad
Du-rag, Southfield, potato on the barrel
The ghetto silence is surrounded with violence, clip the apparel (shhhhh)
Rhythm and ghetto Danny and Darryl, strikin up the lightning
Just to heighten the awareness when I'm a titan with Mike Tyson
Need beef go bison, need {?} go {?}
Like Eminem go thrice and, cold killa you ice 'em (yo)

[Layzie Bone]
Tec-9's, 380's baby, Lil' Layzie gon' keep it gravy
Mossberg to the 12-guage pump, I dump dump, shady baby
Bust shots out the droptop of the Bentley or Mercedes (hey)
Niggaz smile and they wave at me, at the same time try to play me
So it's two vans with eight niggaz, sixteen hands and sixteen triggers
Like FedEx, we will deliver, don't want war, be cool lil' nigga
I figure y'all plottin, y'all want what I got
I'm pistol packin, whistlin actin with my ooh-wop-wop (wop-wop)

[Chorus]  2X w/ minor variations</pre>
