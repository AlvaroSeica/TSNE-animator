Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, yeah
Unh huh, unh huh
Unh huh, unh huh
Yeah
I'm a wife yo ass up
Yeah I'm a yeah

See I done met a million girls
A million different faces
All over the world
A million different places
But when I saw you
Lookin' like a star
I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So I jumped up out my whip
And started walkin' closer
Didn't know your name
So I tapped you on your shoulder
Hit you with my number
And asked you to come over
You said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now baby I ain't tellin' no lies
I ain't never seen a ass like that
So big but fits so right
So round but it's still so fat
And you got me like

Aye pretty girl
Aye sexy sexy lady
They way that that booty move make me go crazy
Ooh
I'm a wife yo ass up
Wife yo sexy ass up

Aye pretty girl
Aye sexy sexy lady
They way that that booty drop make me go crazy
Ooh
I'm a wife yo ass up
Wife yo sexy ass up

Up in the club, dancin' to them slow songs
She show me love, said baby this is yo song
I'm like "What's up? Are you tryna get freaky? "
She said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I get my drink, and then proceed to two-step
Then get right to it 'cause we only got a few left
So grab yo girls, and let's make it a party
She said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby I ain't tellin' no lies
I ain't never seen a ass like that
So big but fits so right
So round but it's still so fat
And you got me like

Aye pretty girl
Aye sexy sexy lady
They way that that booty move make me go crazy
Ooh
I'm a wife yo ass up
Wife yo sexy ass up

Aye pretty girl
Aye sexy sexy lady
They way that that booty drop make me go crazy
Ooh
I'm a wife yo ass up
Wife yo sexy ass up
