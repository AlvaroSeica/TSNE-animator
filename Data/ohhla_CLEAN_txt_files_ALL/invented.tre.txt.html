[Intro: Trey Songz]
This goes out to the beautiful girls
Which one of y'all, which one of y'all
Which one of y'all goin' home wit trigga

[Trey Songz]
I see you in the club oo shawty
Walkin past a nigga lookin at me all naughty
Then I said baby wassup
Reach for that hand shake got a hug
Bottles of H got me wit a lil buzz
Up in VIP wit all my thugs niggas
U leaned over and said you want me
Girl when the vallet pull the benz up
Off to the crip shawty where we gon end up
Girl sit back relax hold up
Let me turn the radio on

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl when I get you to the crib
(get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(upstairs to the bed)
Girl you will think [x4]
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you will think [x4]
You will think I invented sex [x3]

[Trey Songz]
Put the code in the gate
Pull up to the driveway
said she like the way i touch her
Listenin to usher I got a confession
know we 'bout to sin
but your body is a blessing
(Father forgive me)
Girl can we take it upstairs
My bed is waiting there
All I want to do is
Give you all of me
Won't you give me all of you
I want your body like right now (right now)
You know I live a magnum lifestyle (lifestyle)
Baby turn the lights down
And ima turn you on

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl when I get you to the crib
(get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(upstairs to the bed)
Girl you will think [x4]
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you will think [x4]
You will think I invented sex [x2]
Cuz im gonna do it like I did

[Drake]
Its a celebration clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado
For the girl whos a student and the friend whos a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gon do it big like this
Yea and he was just practice
He aint in your world you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire can I be the one you match with
Ill give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
show me where you heads at
Maybe I can grasps it
If you ever come up wit a question you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still I can get you past it
Yea and your friends all suggest
Whats the chance of this nigga being betta than the rest
Just tell em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl when I get you to the crib
(get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(upstairs to the bed)
Girl you will think [x4]
Girl when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you will think [x4]
You will think I invented sex [x3] </pre>
