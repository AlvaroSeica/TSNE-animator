Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, Migos, Rocky!
Say you wanna be somebody
Feel like Rocky Balboa

Say you wanna change the game
Then you gotta make a name
Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa
I used to be an underdog
I used to!
Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa

Went to the top of the stairs I'm feeling
Quiver me Millie
This level to the shit of my city
The dog, the 100 the 50
Young nigga back then checking Minchi
I did it, lil mama used to lend me something

Remember that nigga Orlando
That's that with the regular
Rapping for, blues food
That's a game move
Remember when he was on top
In high school, I remember that
Reality hit in the real are the one

You say you wanna change the game
Then you gotta make a name
Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa
I used to be an underdog
I used to!
Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa

Rocky Balboa...
Cruising the mama
Pulling a record about balling my day
My diamonds are deviant ass
Used to a hundred dollar now I'm a biz
I trap a game bass in the match
Take a nigga bitch sent you with the crib
Pardon, pardon, pardon like Millie mask
Do it my way I made a name
I changed the game...
Just give me her address and don't tell her name
This is my life get a clear understanding
Fresh unopened get it clear with a burst
Bitch be treating me like I'm the go
Fly is the bitch form the 8 left pose
Kicking bitch shit I'm Sosa with the low
Long way!

You say you wanna change the game
Then you gotta make a name
Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa
I used to be an underdog
I used to!
Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa

Rocky Balboa how I beat the block
Trying to stay on the spot if you're trying to get a feeling
I was rock bottom down man that's why I came
On the block with the homeless what I got my name from
Pull up with the bombs in the hood like he's saying something
Bitches like I can't kick it I came and took one
Chico down in Mexico
1000 square...
Diamond VVs and they clear they hitting like Ciroc

You say you wanna change the game
Then you gotta make a name
Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa
I used to be an underdog
I used to!
Balboa, Rocky Balboa, Rocky
Rocky Balboa, Rocky Balboa</pre>
