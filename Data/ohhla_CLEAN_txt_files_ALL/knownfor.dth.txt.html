Song:   Known For It
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Known for it.. known for it

Known for it, been through it
Done everything I can to it
Road to it, til I broke through it
Never was attached to it
Took all I had in a flash knew it was bout ta crash
So I mashed through hit
Known for it
Had ta do it
Hacked into it

I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you wont get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho dont it?
Dont it.. Known for it

Let it eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon ta freak this

You can tell me what you said - go ahead
But no sooner than you said it,
You can bet it was left for dead
All you said in and out of my head in seconds

Keep em guessin endlessly
Never let em know where your headed
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery
How ta show em they dont mean shit ta me

Never meant a thing to me
Effortlessly dead to me
Check the sign no vacancy
Extremely selective memory

Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone
Or itll take everything you own, floor it
Get it, get it

I pay the price ta roll wit it
Waste your life and you wont get it
Played out wit nowhere ta go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho dont it?
Dont it.. Known for it

Let it eat shit and die
As I creep lit
Off the deep hits wit a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon ta freak this

Known for it since way back, all about it
Never been without it
How ta ride it inside out of da clouded
By the enemy surrounded
Thoughts that make you feel lost dont doubt it
You might just need it

Already did that,
Can't never go back
Yeah fuck that
Gets the bozack

Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done wit that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, dont trip
If ya have one let a man so I could flip a bitch and kill it

Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it
Every time I get it ta wind, round my finger and recline
Behave or be slayed cuz I will be damned if mine ever decays

Forever on attack gut check the blind

Game recognize game is tight
Bow down or get banged for life

Cuz I.. am.. known for it</pre>
