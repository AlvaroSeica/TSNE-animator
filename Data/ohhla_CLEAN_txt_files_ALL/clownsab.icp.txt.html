Song:   The Clowns Are Back
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Back to the big top
Back to the crowd
Back to the cannon blasts, we loud
Back to the tightrope
Back to the lions
Back to the acrobatics flying
Babies crying
Spectators scared
Ape boy, jugglas, lady with a beard
First one to go
Red mist hit the front row
The clowns are back in town
Hellooooooo!

Oh!
We back again
It's happening
We back in town
So come on down

We got yo ticket
We got that killer candy
And if you like it wicked
This circus ain't like any

Bang!
Pow!
Boom!

Back to the Freek Show
House of Mirrors
Maze of Amazement
Gone for years
Back to the dunk tank
Guess your size
Back to the Serpent Lady's lies
Tigers let loose into the crowd
All appalling
All so proud
All affordable in surround sound
Come one, come all, and get down
Ladies and gentlemen, gather round
The clowns are back in town!

Oh!
We back again
It's happening
We back in town
So come on down

We got yo ticket
We got that killer candy
And if you like it wicked
This circus ain't like any

Bang!
Pow!
Boom!

T-t-th-the mesmerizing
Hy-hy-hypmotizin
Evo-evolving Dark Carnival
I-i-i-is back in To-o-o-o-own
W-w-w-way up that sloppy, loopy bi-itch ass of yours

Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado
The throat chokers, cut-throat jokers
Juggalotus and you know this
Most hated band on the planet
So fresh they can't stand it
Dark Carnival minions
The Duke of the Wicked
And the Southwest-side Stranglord himself
Big Violent J, and Sugar Shaggy2Dope
Wicked-wicky-wocked-wicky-wicked Clowns, bitch!

Oh!
We back again
It's happening
We back in town
So come on down

We got yo ticket
We got that killer candy
And if you like it wicked
This circus ain't like any

Sha-a-a-a-aggy Shaggs, Violent J, and Mike E. Clar-ar-ark!
Psychopathic Records, bitch!

Bang!
Pow!
Boom!

A-a-a-a-a-a-all across yo sweet ass lips
Motherfucke-e-e-e-e-e-e-er!</pre>
