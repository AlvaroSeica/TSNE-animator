Let's get it on get it on get it on

[Chorus]
I'm still here (3X)

[Lil Menace]
Mija you must have put a spell on my mind
Come give me some of your time damn your fine
And your kisses taste like wine
Know I'm sitting here all alone reminiscing
About the times we shared
The love we had and know I'm missing
Cause you're the only one that had that part of me
Yes the key to my heart
I was your potion you were my recipe
I miss you baby I'm waiting for you to come back
You appear like a mirage everyday it makes me sad
Because I reach out for you but you're just a vision
Like an angel coming from heaven
To get with you was a mission
But I know now that I'm with you again
There's no time to be friends because I promise I'll be there till the end

[Chorus]
I'm still here (3X)

[Ese Deli]
After so many years when you think I would go
I don't need to say I love you cause you already know
The time we spent together was the best in my life
My expectation was only of you being my wife
I would kill and die for you you know what you mean to me
Something I never felt before is what you bring to me
My angelito chiquito my dulcecito
You were my mamacita I was your papacito
I could see your eyes looking and your smile that makes me crazy
I feel your hands touch me and your kisses that make me lazy
Everyday is a knew beginning you were my primavera
You are always on my mind 24/7 I swear ta
God how I miss ya damn how I need ya
You're all inside of my body [hah]
 I even breathe ya but you're not in front of me
So I could see if you ever come back you'll know where I'll be because

[Chorus]
I'm still here (3X)

[Lil Menace]
Mi amor ven aqui y dame un beso
Esto es amor por que lo siento en mi pecho
Un beso por un beso y nunca te dejó
Sola con nadie por que eres mi angel del cielo
Diosito gracias por darme este regalo
La razón por que estoy enamorado
Y mija te dije que nunca te iba a olvidar
Tu eres mi sol y ahora tengo que trabajar
Para tu corazón que tienes por dentro
Vamos a estar juntos por vida o hasta que yo me muera

[Chorus]
I'm still here (3X)</pre>
