[Intro: Jay-Z]
Yeah, what you critics said would never happen
We dedicate this album to anybody people said, couldn't make it..
To the fans that held us down 'til e'rybody came around... (*echoes*)
Welcome, it's here!

Laaaaaaaaaaast summer we took threes 
across the boarrrrrrrrrd
But by faaaaaaaaaall, we were a cover story 
"Now in storrrrrrres"

Make us poster boys for your scene 
But we, are, not making an acceptance speech 
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes 
Every dot, com's refreshing for a journal updaaate 

[Chorus 2X]
So long live the car crash hearts 
Cry on the couch, all the poets come to liiiife 
Fix me in forty-fiiiiiive

I can taaaaaaaaaaaake your problems away 
with a nod and a waaaaaaaaaave
of, my, haaaaaaaaand
'cause that's just the kind of boy 
that, I ammmmmm-aya-heh-eh-aaaam 

The on-LY thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me, and, my plus one at the afterlife 
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the die-HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARDS

[Chorus 2X]

Long live the car crash heaaaaaaarts
(Long live the car crash heaaaaaarts)
Long live the car crash heaaaaaaarts
(Long live the car crash heaaaaaarts)

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Hehe, WOO!!

YOUNG! F-O-B!!
Let's go..</pre>
