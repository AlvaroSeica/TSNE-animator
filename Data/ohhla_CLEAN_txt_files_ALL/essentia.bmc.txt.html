Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I can hear you in my ear [x2]
Painting pictures in my head
Reminiscing on what's dead
Like what could I have said [x4]

I can hear you in my ear
painting pictures in my head
reminiscing on what's dead
like what could I have said
baby stay don't go wait don't leave
girl I can't go on
you're my essential needs
girl you're my my essential needs
my essential needs
girl you're my my essential needs
I need you here with me

Teflon, what I gotta do to get you back
keep you running through my mind
let me break it down every time
I think about you and what we been through
I could never see me doing it without you
I need you by my side
I need a chick down to ride
laid back when I look into your eyes
and the deep thought of what you say
when there's love in the tub
when there's back rubs and you say you want a thug
who can do it like me
I'm reminiscing over everything we had
I was there when you was mad
I was there when you was sad girl
we used to sit back and laugh about the things in the past
and you told me I was something that you never had
but it just didn't work I didn't think we would fall apart
girl you still in my heart
got you going through my mind painting 
ictures in my head now I remember when you said (I love you)

I can hear you in my ear
painting pictures in my head
reminiscing on what's dead
like what could I have said
baby stay don't go
wait don't leave girl I can't go on
your my essential needs
girl you're my my essential needs my essential needs
girl you're my my essential needs
I need you here with me

Yeah I know that I did you wrong
I can't help it girl it's just how I roll
sorry girl let me make it up yet deep inside
yeah you holding up reminiscing got me thinking back
and you know it's true that I want you back
and you want me so what's up with that
what's up with that stop holding back

Yeah what I need is you
tell me what I gotta do to get you back
at the late night calls hear you say you got a man
I know it's been a minute when you run right back when we fight
and I'm grabbing and I'm holding on you tight in the middle of the night
with the music down low and you can't say no
and it start right here teflon in your ear
reminiscing what we had and I wanna bring it back
and it's just like that

I can hear you in my ear
painting pictures in my head
reminiscing on what's dead
like what could I have said
baby stay don't go wait don't leave
girl I can't go on your my essential needs
girl you're my my essential needs

I need you here with me
Oh girl it's hurting my heart
oh girl it's hurting my heart
oh girl it's hurting my heart
my heart but I under stand I understand
I understand but I gotta let you (gooooo)
I can hear you in my ear
painting pictures in my head
