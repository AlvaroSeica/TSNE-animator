I said
And I said
And I said
'Cause he told me, cause he told me, cause he told me

(hook)
Why should I worry 'bout what people say, (people say)
When they 'gon talk about me anyway, (anyway)
They 'gon make up all sorta things, (sorta things)
I just got to be the bigga man
And let it roll off
The talk don't bother me
I believe in me
If nobody else does
And let it roll off
Just like the water on the feather of a dove's back yeah
I said

You probably wouldn't worry me so much
If I was out there
Behind closed doors
I was what they called caught up
Stealin, duckin', and drugs
Livin' reckless
And takin' advantage of all I worked so damn hard for
Petey needed help
But afriad to ask
Lonely, depressed, or just needed someone else
On the verge of givin' up
Paranoid, scared, I'm totally overlookin how much I've been blessed
I could understand what you say they said
And most of all why they said it
I just nod my head
When you're wrong you're wrong
I'll admit it
I'll confess to anything if I did it
But to spread un-necessary lies
I don't get it
How could you find enjoyment in my business
Ya know what, forget it
Talk my nigga
If you wasn't talkin' 'bout me
I'd probably miss it

(hook)

Petey doin' this
Petey doin' that
I seen Petey here
Well what he doin' there?
Why you don't come and ask
It ain't 'gon make me mad
I respect that more then you doin' it like you have
Bothrin' my family
Scarin' them to death
Why you talkin' to them 'bout it when you could talk to me yourself
I might flash back, lose it
And tear into ya ass
Or I could be a man about it
And talk and clear the air up
But you wont neva know that
cause you wont take the chance
What that mean
Ya missin' somethin' in the crotch of ya pants
It just make me laugh
cause sometimes the stories be so outragous
Can't say nothin' but Damn
Ya know what I really am?
Beyond that
cause momma told me somethin one day
And ain't forgot it
If they scared to lie to my Heavenly Father's precious name
Then who am I to complain

(hook)

I don't care, go 'head
Stop, get away from here
Leave me alone (leave me alone), Leave me alone (leave me alone)
I don't care, go 'head
Stop, get away from here
Leave me alone (leave me alone), Leave me alone (leave me alone)
The rumors you spread
Don't botha me
The lies you tellin'
Don't botha me
I thought about it
And I wouldn't be no better than you
I don't care, go 'head
Stop, get away from here
Leave me alone (leave me alone), Leave me alone (leave me alone)
