[Intro: from South Park]
Welcome to City Sushi
Can I take your order please?
  What's the big idea
  Putting your Shitty Sushi right next my Shitty Wall?
I'm sorry, I do not understand your accent
You want Shitty Tuna Roll?
  No I don't want Shitty Tuna Roll
  I want you to go find another shitty town
  to open your shitty sushi prace!
Why don't you please speak English?
Maybe I can understand you!!

[Ras Kass]
It's time!
Come here, listen, get a bar nigga
I'll chop the head off you dicks like a Bar Miztvah
Protect your neck, clown get brass, turtle neck sweaters
Even Marie Antoinette had a circus right before they behead her
Duh! What I'm saying is this
It's twenty five drops to Zero, off the A list
Viva Las Vegas, hot go go dancers in cages
Live on stages, Saturday night, Jason Sudeikis
Take your bitch, now he crying for his pussycat
Throw live kittens through your window, you could have your pussy back
Bend words into prison shanks
Where the term "mightier than the sword" originates
It ain't with you from, it's wherever you use your OnStar
Beef just dry-snitching on VladTV and WorldStar
To tell the truth, they don't tell the truth
Chocolate nigga, strawberry Benz with the vanilla roof
Call it Neopolitan
I poli(tic) against the oligarchy on a mission, composition, start anarchy
I son y'all niggaz like the man Barkley
Screaming your money or your life is a grand larceny
Cough up the parsley, carve to the dark meat
With the Benz carkey it's year round shark week

[Chorus]
Aiyyo, come here, listen get a bar nigga
In the streets locked up, get a bar nigga
Rich or poor, give a fuck who you are, nigga?
Sushi, the definition of raw spitter
Yeah, c'mon listen, get a bar nigga
In the dorms, on the block, drinkin malt liquor
Black or white, give a fuck who you are, nigga?
Sushi, the definition of raw spitter

[Ras Kass]
I pop out the house like Oscar the Grouch
Where I'm from, they C-Walk, stay chalkin you out
Where I'm from they B-Walk, never walkin it out
Shit don't change, that's the stuff that get lost in the couch
I hide dragons, convince +Tigers+ to +Crouch+
Bisons bring the birds in, then we migrate it South
White from 'round the corner, your dihydrated mouth
Like Al Jolsen, I'm Al Pacino, Al'Qaeda
Al B. Sure but darker call it a all-nighter
Y'all pinatas, knock the stuffin out of all y'all foul biters
I'm Spiderman, stick to bitches walls for real though
You Transvestite Man, bit by a radioactive dildo
That's what they call an ill rap these days?
I'm cancer, herpes, Satan, and the clap these days
Live by the California code
Crips in the whip, somebody called it a California roll

[Chorus]

[Ras Kass]
Spit a pin with a pen, original sin
When I hop in the booth wearing a cannibal skin
MySpace and Fruity Loops let the amateurs in
Still my sons call me father like The Vatican man
Smelling like cigarettes, vodka, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana
Aphrodisiac, a drunk slut smokin mari-jo-wuana
Sarah Connor with a metal cerebellum
My bitches hard headed, won't do what I tell 'em!
Cause now I wanna sell 'em, work for Heidi Floess
Might is right after death comes eternal nighty-night
But on the other hand I let my grandma down
Dressing like a clown with my pants on the ground
Hands on the pound, thinking 'bout robbing the nearest bank
In a mask like The Town
Spit out a brown smokers loogie, rookie
I'm nasty like Jabba havin a baby by Snooki

[Chorus]</pre>
