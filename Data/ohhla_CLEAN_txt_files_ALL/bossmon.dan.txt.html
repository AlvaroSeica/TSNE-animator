CHORUS - CHIP FU:
Any sound bwoy, yes who try cross the border
We slaughter whole of them whoever follow after
Them soft man, just like baby food in a sauce pan
You must be real schupid try to replace the bossmon

DAN-E-O:
You should basically know we replacing your flow
Put a nigga mother fuckin' face to the floor
Tell your silly crew you ain't blazin' no more
Ain't a day you will blow, you a fake we the pros
Getcha girl sayin "those niggas crazy you know"
Chasing the dough but amazingly show
That you're facing the door when we raise up and go
In the place with the pros with a case of the "whoa"!
A little bit of Dan-e-o a little bit of Chip
Get a bigger pitcher we gon' fill it to the tip
Get a friggin' friend and get him in a regimen
That's better meant to head him in a tentative direction to quit
The veterans will rip any head that you can get
A predicament of shit for you little bitter dick
Who get a bit upset when hear a fitter script
Your medicine ain't shit, we forever living sick

CHORUS (x2) - CHIP FU:
Any sound bwoy, yes who try cross the border
We slaughter whole of them whoever follow after
Them soft man, just like baby food in a sauce pan
You must be real schupid try to replace the bossmon 

CHIP FU: 
Where I'm coming from? I be coming from Mars Venus yes and Jupiter 
From 3 planets so nobody do it stupider 
True spitter, yes in other words I'm a true shitter 
Who litters when I'm in the booth yo I loose screw 
All my screws loose I use scruples and they useful 
Every likkle yout will bite off every likkle piece when I do it 
So you better run run run come get your soup bowl 
Yes and get your spoonful
'Cause people always wondering Yo where A nigga been but I been sitting
Penning up these lyrics and I'm ready and willing to kill dem
Bury dem and fill in their grave and place tomb stones 
You'll see bones in their place when I bun dem
Bun dem? Nah run dem
Usain Bolt, it's your fault time to run dem,
Not your fault you fell off time to run dem
Any time I touch mics riddims run dem 
Yes? who say yes? rip through dem blouse and skirts, trouser shirts 
With a thousand hertz then bounce through dem housing house them first 
With a verse that will rip through dem vest
Vest? yes vest poom poom boy yes yes cover your vest if you come to test
Me done the rest, the rest get test get bench pressed yo and left out stretched
Mark out chalk out me walk out leave them etched
Me name dem talk bout and ah shout out, Jungle Rock now ah de best 
Me name dem email and ah Facebook and ah tweet out and ah text 
And all promoters who wanna book me I'm not a rookie cut de check

CHORUS (x2) - CHIP FU:

Any sound bwoy, yes who try cross the border
We slaughter whole of them whoever follow after
Them soft man, just like baby food in a sauce pan
You must be real schupid try to replace the bossmon 

DAN-E-O:
Ya'll niggas joking, talkin' bout the game like you run it but you can't walk
What is y'all smoking? You can have the fame going crazy with your fan blog
Your ego stroking is really 'bout to get y'all into hot water
My top order: make a nigga fear what he hear like a mere word of mine got daughters
And you ain't takin' 'em out, trust me
Mother fucker put a dick in your mouth to succeed
Plus weed never enter my system but I'm so high
We be the measure of skill you need to go by
Yo guy, Scarborough, Brooklyn connection
Excedrin you need for your head that we bendin'
Offendin' your fossy likkle posse
Dan-e-o, Chip Fu, Urban Bounce who the boss be!

CHORUS (x2) - CHIP FU:
Any sound bwoy, yes who try cross the border
We slaughter whole of them whoever follow after
Them soft man, just like baby food in a sauce pan
You must be real schupid try to replace the bossmon</pre>
