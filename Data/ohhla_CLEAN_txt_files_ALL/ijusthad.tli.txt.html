[Intro: Andy Samberg] (Akon)
Sometimes... (Ohh-ohh-ohhhh)
...something beautiful happens in this world (Akon)
You don't know how to express yourself so...
(And Lonely Island!) ...you just gotta sing

[Chorus: Akon]
I just had seeeeex!
And it felt so good (felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside her (Heeeey)
I just had seeee-eeh-ei-eeex, and I'll never go back (Never go back)
to the not-having sex ways of the past

[Andy Samberg]
Have you ever had sex? I have, it felt great
It felt so good when I did it with my penis
A girl let me do it, it literally just happened
Havin sex can make a nice man out the meanest

[Jorma Taccone]
Never guess where I just came from - I had sex
If I had to describe the feeling, it was the best
When I had the sex, man my penis felt great
And I called my parents right after I was done

[Andy Samberg] (Jorma)
Oh hey, didn't see you there, guess what I just did?
Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest
(Was sure nice of her to let you do that thang)
Nice of any girl ever! (Now sing)

[Chorus 2: Akon]
I just had seeeeex!
And it felt so good (felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside her (Heeeey)
Wanna tell the world...

[Andy &amp; Jorma]
To be honest, I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it
Doesn't really make sense, but man screw it
I ain't one to argue with a good thing, she could be my wife 
That good~?! The best thirty seconds of my life
I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her
'Cause honestly, I'd have sex with a pile of manure
With that in mind, the soft nice smelling girl's better
Plus she let me wear my chain and turtleneck sweater

[Akon]
So this one's dedicated to them girls
that let us flop around on top of them
If you're near or far, whether short or tall
We wanna thank you all, for letting us FUCK you!
(She kept lookin at her watch) - Doesn't matter, had sex
(But I cried the whole time) - Doesn't matter, had sex!
(I think she might've been a racist) - Doesn't matter, had sex
(She put a bag on my head) - Still count!
I just had seeeeex! (SEEEEEX!)
And my dreams came true (Dreams came true)
So if you had sex in the last thirty minutes
then you're qualified to sing with me

[Chorus]</pre>
