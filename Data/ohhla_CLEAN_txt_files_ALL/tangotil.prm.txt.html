Song:   Tango Till You're Sore
Typed by: PremRock

Drunk off my Bourbon
I can gaze into my past
The role for my soul been openly miscast
No more holds on control
You can nail me to the mast
I'll be on my way and don' worry I ain't never coming back

I can tango till I'm sore
Drink till I hit the floor
Take me to my rest
Forever more

Fallin outta window with Confetti in my hair
I can feel the ever ready
ready to sever whatever's there
Watch the whiskey levitate
Never break whatever's fair
Average height,
Debonaiire
Silver Tooth, metal glare
Feel it in the air, the doubt
the wearing out.
Bartender double up on this glass
Let's take it there
Pick apart the nightmares
Leave em at the step
Let's enjoy the evening
Before the demons collect

And with this last drink
I will dedicate my past
Everyone in this saloon
please elevate their glass
Some soldiers earn medals
Some never make it back
Some allocate the facts
to manufacture a path
 
I can tango till I'm sore
Drink till I hit the floor
Take me to my rest
Forever more

Promise me  you'll bury my Clarinet in the ground
When I return to my essence I'll be in need of the sound
It seems my life's progression's been played in the background
Like datatatataatattadatt.... How that sound?
It's storytime children
We buildin' let's gather round...
We dance the tarantella
Live this night forever we gettin down
The Cubans hit the floor
Like what you did it for?
I did it cuz I'm livin'
I get it... Let's get it more

Drunken off my Scotch
I can gaze into my past
The role for my soul been openly miscast
No more holds on control
You can nail me to the mast
I'll be on my way and don' worry I ain't never coming back

I can share every part my dreams
In which I bleed
Tethered to my sleeves
Come apart at the seams
Tonight we dance till were dead
Step outside of our heads
Leave behind the past and soak up all the regrets
Bury the common sense
Live in the present-tense
Exonerating the facts
drinking to it's success
Get me to New Orleans or whichever will suffice
Paint my name upon the pew in celebration of life</pre>
