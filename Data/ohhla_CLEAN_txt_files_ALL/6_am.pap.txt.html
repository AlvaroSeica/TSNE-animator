[Intro: Sample]
I asked him he wanted me to hustle up his bail but he said no
He just didn't give a damn anymore

[Police yelling]
POLICE! POLICE! (GO GO GO!) SHOW YOUR HANDS ASSHOLE!
(MOVE MOVE!) DOWN ON THE GROUND!

[Chorus: Sample from "6'n The Mornin" by Ice T] (Papoose)
Six in the mornin police at my door
Six-S-Six in the mornin police at-at-at (I'm 'bout to cut down the fire escape)
Six in the mornin police at my door (Bring the car 'round me meet me in the back)
Six-S-Six in the mornin police at my door (Damn one out there too!)

[Verse One: Papoose]
They would say bling bling if my jewels could talk
So you can still see me shinin when the room get dark
I'm like Tony Danza I'll show you +Who's The Boss+
Teach my worker who's the fiends and who's the narcs
It's alot of niggas out tryin to prove they hard
'Til you hit they cousin up and make them move they aunt
Yo, I would wild out and let the rueg' just spark
But you know how the hood be when someone screwed your start
All the basketball tournaments was cool to watch
Bet your money, lose a little or lose alot
They beat us by one point yeah them dudes was sharp
But I'm a sore loser so I had to shoot up the park
I wouldn't have robbed your man if the fool was smart
But a fool and his money will soon depart
Then I went to my crib went to sleep 'bout four
When I woke up, police was at my door, damn!

[Interlude: Police yelling]
POLICE! POLICE! (GO GO GO!) SHOW YOUR HANDS ASSHOLE!
(MOVE MOVE!) DOWN ON THE GROUND!

[Chorus: Sample from "6'n The Mornin" by Ice T] (Jadakiss)
Six in the mornin police at my door (Uh!)
Six-S-Six in the mornin police at-at-at (Uh Huh!)
Six in the mornin police at my door (EH HEH!)
Six-S-Six in the mornin police at my door (Yo! Yo Yo!)

[Verse Two: Jadakiss]
Just aired the dice game out that's the truth babe
'Bout to hit the crib take a shower watch a bootleg
Glad nothin popped off, gotta get the bag out of the crib
Goose dropped off so it can get knocked off
Uh! Then I got a sharp pain in my chest
But knowin I ain't 'posed to have it in the place I rest
Yes! But it's a half a joint in there
Two 40 cals with the hollow points in there
Few bricks of diesel couple pounds of purple
Gallon of the water plus a thousand circles
A man hit me sayin that he be here in a minute
All I got to do is wrap it and bring it down to the rented
By now it's a little past five
And I'm still tryin to roll could barely open my eyes
Next thing I know she givin me a massage
Instead of wakin up rich I woke up to a surprise

[Interlude: Police yelling]
POLICE! POLICE! (GO GO GO!) SHOW YOUR HANDS ASSHOLE!
(MOVE MOVE!) DOWN ON THE GROUND!

[Chorus: Sample from "6'n The Mornin" by Ice T] (Jim Jones)
Six in the mornin police at my door 
Six-S-Six in the mornin police at-at-at 
Six in the mornin police at my door (Tellin you I live this story right here)
Six-S-Six in the mornin police at my door (Uh!)

[Verse Three: Jim Jones]
It goes six in the mornin police at my door (They got a warrant?!)
At five in the mornin I was up in this broad (She had good head)
At four in the mornin we was at the club door (BALLIN!)
A few hours before that I was gettin fresh in the store (Gettin fly!)
Now a week before that I was at the car lot (Tryin to cop)
Thinkin convertible so I could make the broad drop (Ferrari)
A half a million cash off a three month run (Gettin cake)
Them rubber band stacks and ten g lump sums (We loaded!)
Police was on our back 'cause we dumped guns (Get 'em!)
So when Byrd Gang's outside mu'fucker just run (Eastside!)
We just dumb (Yep!) Like the hyphy life (E-40 and 'em!)
I told you life was a bitch not the wifey type (You tried to marry her)
And we got the white bricks if the price is right (That frisco!)
Catch you standin on the strip in the icy white (Fifteen easy)
Season of heirs, we in the V switchin gears
Droppin the top blowin weed in the air (FLOSSIN!)
She's showin her ass....and...next thing I know I got a detective in my face 
All askin me all type of questions I don't know shit but get my lawyer!

[Interlude: Police yelling]
POLICE! POLICE! (GO GO GO!) SHOW YOUR HANDS ASSHOLE!
(MOVE MOVE!) DOWN ON THE GROUND!

[Chorus: Sample from "6'n The Mornin" by Ice T] 
Six in the mornin police at my door 
Six-S-Six in the mornin police at-at-at 
Six in the mornin police at my door 
Six-S-Six in the mornin police at my door

[Outro: Police yelling]
POLICE! POLICE! (GO GO GO!) SHOW YOUR HANDS ASSHOLE!
(MOVE MOVE!) DOWN ON THE GROUND!</pre>
