Song:   You And Yours
Typed by: Raneforezt@aol.com

Yeah, dedicated to you and yours
OC phenomenon

Chorus:
Here goes a little somethin', for you and your mans
Dedicated to you and yours, from me and my fam
Living life to the limit with the world in my hand
I got nothin' but love for ya main man

Yo, yo, yo, with this here shit, I freak it like a wiz
And uh, lace the track like my nigga Showbiz
I'm uh, kinda sore with the microphone, pah no doubt
OC gon' turn it on out
Yes uh, follow me now if you didn't follow before
How shall I attend to ascend this raw
You pull up to a light, knockin' my hits, flickin' your Bic
Gold chain thick, to the chicks, lickin' your lips
They hop on it, to my cassette like a cock
They feenin' for what I give like puffin' a rock
?????, food for thought like my nigga A.G.
Givin' NYC, nigga I live in it
Let's go, mess no, rhyme I bless the flow
Dippin' with UNI, swerve, control the Lex though
Boppin' with Jigga, droppin' jewels to beats
Then I bounce and ghost ride with my main man Sweets
He can wax a nigga

CHORUS

As sure as my name is OC, I hold much testosterone
And serve like hors d'ouevers
I'm maximum, human saxophone
You respect what I'm saying like Al Capone
You crumb bubble gum rappers I chew
Blow you up, spit you out like food without seasonin', you got no taste
Yo OG, who could solo with me?
These kids be half grown
I'm an adult, seen it all
I'm forced to show VI's can duck proper
My ways and actions, far from an imposter
Shine like bright light
Your worst nightmare like Fright Night
Comin' to you live like a fight night
Must you steal the way I drop bars on this?
Perfection at it's best, I'm marvelous
Applaud me you better, I ???? to get a response
Control shit at the snap of a finger like I'm the Fonz
Fella whattup?

CHORUS

You say it ain't so, how I freak the flow
Joey Crack type shit nigga, blow for blow
Big G, Dog Tag Crew holdin' it down
Cousin Boo will make a U and bust shots at you
You see, it's my world, or like so it seems
Chillin' with Prim, dippin' on the highway in a Beem
And it's a wonderful day, just coolin' one night
Celebratin' a par-tay with a nigga named "Life"
We twisted, kid you missed it
At a down low spot, Champagne poppin' off like a biscuit
Nuff love, word life, I'm high tonight
No brawls or fights, just men, no mice
Indecisive about things in life alone
So sometimes I speak in a hyper tone
See I won't neglect this, nor can you deny
Renassaince man, make it live, the fly guy
Respect me like a Kennedy, acknowledge my identity
O's like a cure, I'm the source, the remedy
You know it

CHORUS

I got nothin' but love for the DITC
I got nothin' but love for the Rockafella, Jay-Z
I got nothin' but love for the Wastelands Family
I got nothin' but love for the Mr. Cheeks and LB'z</pre>
