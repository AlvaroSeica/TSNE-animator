[Esham]
We tight
Natas
Niggaz Ahead Of Time And Space
And uh... y'all niggas don't know
What the future is

[Mastamind]
Where the future at?

[Esham]
The future's lookin dim... it's lookin dim

[Mastamind]
Is it how I'm livin or this wicket town I live in?
Ill decisions got me sellin my soul to roll like a villain
I'm all in in this mission
I can see it now wicket and wild, frail mental visions
Oh my God, there they go, here we come they done came
Natas
Sick with the name (Name)
Sick with the game (Game)
Sick with the pen so much, God can't save em
Make em
Say a prayer before I early grave em

[Esham]
I do no coke sniffin so Allen Griffin in Comerica
Now all of America in mass hysteria
Worldwide police bank robbery in Hollywood
Niggas on the East, and the West coast up to no good, so

[Esham]
(Bless the words that I speak)  You can sell me yo soul
Sell me yo soul (bless the words that I speak)
Sign the Devil's Contract (Bless the words that I speak)
(Bless the words that I speak) Sell me yo soul

[Esham]
The wicket ass warlock, who totes the glock
I'll make ya
Body rotten niggas plottin gone forgotten
You niggas better realize you fuckin with death
'Cause ain't shit right, when I got one bullet left
In the chamber my anger make you approach the danger put
Fear in a stranger Detroit strangler
Murder and money make the world move so many
The murder composition'll cut like an incision

[Mastamind]
With my ill vision I done seen so many killas
So bitch you know your life can be gone at any given
Watch the world blow up, watch the cracked streets
Blow up like a gas leak nigga, don't get yo ass beat
Wicket niggas, ride on whoever, it's like a reign of terror
It don't stop never... never... it don't stop never
Sell me yo soul

[Esham]
And you can sell me yo soul

[TNT]
Sign yo name up on the line, there's no future at all
Niggas been gone like my 'scalenes and alcohol
Got the whole world jumpin, and bumpin my shit
And if you hoes don't like it you can eat a dick

[Esham]
I got a .357, plus suicidal
Unholy is my title and I'll burn ya Bible
In this new world we livin in, somethin's gotta give
In God we trust, make all you niggas sin
from dawn to dusk, turn yo love to lust
Bitches flip out they drawers like Dominique Dawes

[TNT]
The one and only bomb dropper
Still fuck a copper
And I won't hesitate to pull out the nine and pop ya

[Esham]
From the terror in the aisles, wicket styles
Smokin the black and milds, ridin 7 mile
Recite the Lord's Prayer start blastin
Screamin redrum assassin
Paranoid, schizophrenic
When I bust I make the police panic
Too gigantic in this world we live
uF eht kcuF -gees and all the groupies

[Mastamind]
All those who evade jurisdiction must not have paid attention
Mastamind's in this bitch again
When you listenin, what you picturin?
You should see me ridin through the ghetto mist in the wind
And make it a sin for puttin wicket words in text
No nigga, can see me in this life, catch me in the next

[TNT]
For the money and gold, for the fame and riches
Niggas keep sellin they souls for blind ambitions
But if they follow me nigga they know the right way to go
Take a ride on the wild side and let that shit flow... flow

[Esham]
And you can sell me yo soul, sell me yo soul

[TNT]
You can sell me yo soul

[Esham]
Sign the Devil's Contract

[Mastamind]
Welcome to my nightmare, welcome to my mind hoe
I'll never grind slow, I'll get mine and go
I got my name on the Devil's Contract, I'm that
Nigga you don't want to come at
I run the game so quick
I'll make you think that your brain was sick
All that's goin on in this world is subterrain shit
I got this wicketness on my mind
And I wonder if I sign the Devil's Contract 
could I turn the page, and find
Diamonds and gold, riches and hoes
Meditate life so much I never listen to those who oppose

[Esham]
Unholy Esham that's what I said
etirovaf ruoy kcuF rapper got a hole in his head
As the world turns, your soul still burns
And most of y'all motherfuckers still mislead

(Bless the words that I speak)

[Mastamind]
And you can sell me yo soul

(Bless, bless the words that I speak)

[Esham]
You can sell me yo soul

(Bless the words that I speak)

[Mastamind]
I'll sell em all

[Esham]
Sign the Devil's Contract

(Bless the words that I speak)

[Esham]
Uh.. uh... It don't stop

[Mastamind]
Neva stop

[Esham]
The wicket shit'll never die!

[Mastamind]
Never Die...

[Esham]
And you know what? (What's that?)
Fuck every radio station, from here, across the nation

[Mastamind]
Ain't down with this shit!

[Esham]
Underground... Yo, we got a pirate radio station, yo

[Mastamind]
Let that shit play

[Esham]
Oh, oh... This is for all the niggas who don't ride... they ridin
We ridin down Jefferson now... we just gonna ride... That's right

[Mastamind]
Fuck it...
Gothom City

[Esham]
I be the nigga that can get up in legends, 
with the rockports on outside
With the pipe in the ride
The 850, the pimp and the ho
Bumpin the Master P and not D'Angelo
The radio disc jock Sarah Connor
Gone off wet and marijuana
The unholy bitch yeah it's me
Straight out the D so who wants a key
I'll split the wig
Of a dirty pig
Made a deal with the Devil and I won't relieve
Fuck life is my motto, 'cause it's just like lotto
See you win some you lose some, use some abuse some
Niggas think rap records gone save they life
And niggas think trick hoes gone be they wife
Well I'm here to let you know that all that shit's wrong
And dead motherfuckers don't sing no songs
They don't... sing no songs
They don't sing no songs nigga

[Mastamind]
Dead men don't sing
But they do dream
About bein alive
Sign it on, my nigga
Nigga, you can get away wit it
Nigga...

[Esham]
Shit... Niggas wonder how we keep doin this shit
Well uh... Maybe it's because, uh, one night
I was sittin in my room, and, playin with a Ouija board
And I kinda sold my soul
I been doin it ever since! (Laughs)</pre>
