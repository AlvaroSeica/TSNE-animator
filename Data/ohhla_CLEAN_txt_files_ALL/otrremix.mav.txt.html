[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Lord Jesus please be my savior Lord knows I got a whole lot of haters
But I, dust 'em off, I dust 'em off
My mind too strong and my nine too long I reach any pillow you put your little mind on
(RAH!!!) I dust 'em off (RAJH!!!) I dust 'em off
Hold up! You dealin with professionals
So unless you know, war tactics walk backwards
Auto-matic, come across your chest like Catholics
Hail Mary, We'll bury anyone of you motherfuckers hear me!
Welcome to the ROC, It ain't never gonna stop
Rudeboys put your lighters up, rudegirls throw your diamonds up
How the fuck they gonna stop old boy?
I don't even have to write this up
God knows he got a hell of a flow
Where I be without it they don't wanna know
Therefore from the grace of the lord
Now my face grace the cover of The Forbes
BLOODCLAAT!!! You ain't got to love ROC
You gotta respect the way I bake the cake nigga lift nuff shots
I am the ROC, shit I started the ROC
Shit I started with rock, target The ROC
Then you targetin HOV, If you targetin HOV
Then y'all outta know, that you targetin slow
Shield that guides me, be my guidance
No they will never stop me, RAH! RAH! RAH!

[Chorus: Mavado]
Jehovah guide me, be my guidance pray salvation for me
Jehovah guide me, be my guidance no they could never stop me
I'm on the rock (Im on the rock)
Higher than I an I (Higher than I an I)
Jehovah guide me! I am on the rock (I am on the rock)
Go tell my enemies! I'm on the rock!!!!!!!! (Warn dem! Mi nuh go nowehere!)
Selassie guide me!!! (Selassie I! Yaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!)

[Outro: Mavado]
Jehovah guide me, need my guidance, oh lord oh lord
Your excellence in thy name inna di earth
One step thy glory I found I an I!!!
Crown King Selassie I dem waan fi get mi weak!
But yuhn mek mi strong so mi haffi deh yah
All day and all night long, I'm on the rock!
