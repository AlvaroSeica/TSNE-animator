[Kid Talking]
Daddy, why are people dropping bombs on each other?
I don't understand....

[Hook - All]
Some like sunshine, some like rain
Some like pleasure, and some like pain
Some like peace, and some like war
And some don't even know what they're fightin' for
What you're fighting for, what you're fightin for
Do you even really know?
What you're fighting for ohhhh, ohhhhh
What you're fighting for

[Verse 1 - D-Loc]
All I wanna do is live this beautiful life
Feel free, with my girl, my friends and family
Spend my peace and love and truth and unity
Tryin' to stop all the violence and the wars overseas
People come, people go
I know decisive shit
But I can't be depressed over someone else's nonsense
There's no reason, or time, for me to be
Mad or sad, said do you even really know?

[Hook]
Some like sunshine, some like rain
Some like pleasure, and some like pain
Some like peace, and some like war
And some don't even know what they're fightin' for
What you're fighting for, what you're fightin for
Do you even really know?
What you're fighting for ohhhh, ohhhhh
What you're fighting for

[Verse 2 - Johnny Richter]
You and you there too, I'm fightin' for that too
And I hope all of the soldiers come back safe and real soon
We got people bein' shot on the streets every day
While the rich fill they pockets and the poor just pay
Uh, I'm fighting for love and I'm fighting for life
Against those doing wrong and for those doing right, yeah
For my family and my future to come
'Cause if I dont' fight now then there just might not be one

[Hook]
Some like sunshine, some like rain
Some like pleasure, and some like pain
Some like peace, and some like war
And some don't even know what they're fightin' for
What you're fighting for, what you're fightin for
Do you even really know?
What you're fighting for ohhhh, ohhhhh
What you're fighting for

[Verse 3 - Daddy X]
You see, I can see light in the strangest ways
On the darkest nights, and the coldest days
And I'm amazed, that somehow, I can keep smilin'
I can hear music in the depths of silence
I can find peace in the middle of violence
And I can be calm when I should be wildin'
I can find hope when there is despair
And I don't feel alone when there's no one there

[Hook]
Some like sunshine, some like rain
Some like pleasure, and some like pain
Some like peace, and some like war
And some don't even know what they're fightin' for
What you're fighting for, what you're fightin for
Do you even really know?
What you're fighting for ohhhh, ohhhhh
What you're fighting for</pre>
