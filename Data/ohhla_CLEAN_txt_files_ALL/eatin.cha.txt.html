[Intro]
Oooh-hooo, that's right
Oooh-hooo, that's right
Ain't no Captain Savin, can't save 'em
So no need to be playa hatin
Oooh-hooo, that's right

[Chamillionaire]
So many cars, too many keys, I think I need a whole locker
Said to get to me she'll sleep with you, I ain't never met a hoe like her
From overseas, speak Portuguese, she be speakin English so proper
I pull the cover up off the plate and I swear it's lookin like lobster
I'm makin orders, not takin orders, I was never good at cooperatin
I'm too Kurupt, I Snoop Dogg, I Nate Dogg and I Dr. Dre 'em
That money talk, well what it say? I'll let you know and this is all verbatim
"You get the hoes to come to your shows but don't give 'em dough and try not to date 'em"
Look in my safe, no dough was missin, she want a cut, get no incision
I'm startin up a new coalition of bosses that don't need no permission
Not just the president, I'm a client, I'm 5'11", act like a giant
Hop in the yacht and laid in the sun, the sun got me lookin like I'm Hawaiian
Grab passport, let's fast-forward, and take a seat in my villa
Got TV's that pop out the wall like Michael Jackson in "Thriller"
Might do my thang if I let her hang but she got to know I can't be with her
I told the girl she want a +Romeo+ then she better go and find P. Miller

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
Yo' whip stays on big blades, these groupies talkin 'bout freakin
These chicks ain't gon' get saved cause you ain't really no deacon
Live Monday through Friday like every day is the weekend
Yo' car paid and yo' rent paid then you can say that you eatin
Look at me, eatin, eatin - oooh-hooo, that's right
Pretty women and nice cars so every night is a wonderful night
Look at me, eatin, eatin - oooh-hooo, that's right
Grind hard so I shine hard, yeah I'll be a playa for life
Ain't no Captain Savin, can't save 'em
So no need to be playa hatin
Oooh-hooo, that's right

[Chamillionaire]
You got a girl you really love, don't stand there, go cuff her playa
She can't stay here cause the same room ain't somethin that a sucka shares
We eatin good with no Tupperwear, play with my paper, I double dare
I give your girl a trip across the world and leave her in Dubai in her underwear
Psych, I would never do your girl like, that; I be tappin on her curves like, smack
If I took her all across the world she'll probably tell me that she don't want her life, back
And I've never been an undertaker, and plus I ain't tryin to be the one to take her
So much time spent overseas, the rude girl probably thought that I was from Jamaica
Can't take sand, to the beach though, my mackin game is so lethal
I grip the tool and that wood like I just made a stop at Home Depot
That's yo' girl? She's all mine, that's so foul, two free throws
That's my fault, that's my bad, you're all done, finito
And she's showin her anatomy, +Wheel of Fortune+, she can have the D
Every day, got her feelin like a fantasy, got your girlfriend wishin that her man was me
Ay, feelin like you shoulda stayed in, be gettin money all day but the money don't exchange hands
Can't see through my Ray Bans, if you're tryin to play me then you never had a chance

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Grind hard so I shine hard, yeah I'll be a playa for life
