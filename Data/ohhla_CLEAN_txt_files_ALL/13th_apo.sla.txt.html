[Chorus]
The full Gospel, from the 13th apostle
That's me and you, now tell what you gonna do

[Verse 1]
In the beginning was the word and the word became flesh
Through him all things are made, without him there's nothing left
John the Baptist recognized the Christ at first glance
He testified the coming of the Lord as the Lord advanced
Andrew and Simon Peter was the first two to follow
They're faith was immediate, they spirits wasn't hollow
Then Phillip and Nathaniel in the town of Galilee
They watched Jesus turn water to wine for all to see
Jesus, the Son of God made a whip out of cords
For those who tried to market the Word in the house of the Lord
Zeal for your house will consume me, it is written
Destroy the temple, but in three days the temple will be risen
Flesh give birth to flesh, but spirit birth to spirit
You must be born again, not just talk it, but live it
The Son has come to shed light on a dark world
Expose you to the truth, and make you living proof

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Like the Samaritan spirit was dying from thirst
I wanna drink from the spring of life, not from the earth
But from the first, who first made man from the dirt
Others believed from miraculous signs of the times
Like walking on water, and feeding thousands with just five
Loaves and two fish, but the Jew was ruthless
How could a man do this, they knew it was God but still wanted him to prove it
The plan was in movement
After Lazarus was raised they went stir crazed
Set up, a scheme of schemes on the king of king, Judas snitching things
Son of Simon, devil inside him ready to kill the king
Death ridden, to the apostles the plan was hidden
But promised the Holy Spirit, after all, its written
Now father the time has come to glorify your son
Do a work through the apostles, believers, he lost none
On the valley of Kidron, led mainly by the traitor
Was a click of Pharisees to falsely accuse the savior
Peter drew the sword and struck with the ill behavior
On the ear of the servant, even though he deserved it
God's will had to be fulfilled, couldn't let the cup spill
Cuffed the Lord, bought for the priest for the easy kill

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The prophecy of Caiaphas was being fulfilled
3 time denied, back to Pilate, where he was drilled
Questioning the king of the truth, they found no proof
But the Jews wanted him slew, let Barabbas loose
A thief and a murderer, they loved their own
But hated the man, who tried to lead them to the throne
Twisted crown of thorns, mocked, in a purple robe
Crucify was heard from the angry crowd in a drone
The soldiers took charge, placed the cross on his spine
The place of the skull where they crucified the divine
And when it was finished, he bowed his head, have up his spirit
His body placed in a new tomb, wrapped in linen
But don't cry for the Lord of hosts, on the third day he came like a ghost
Appeared to Mary, she stood froze
Cries of joy she screamed, I seen the Lord
Ran to the disciples with the good report
Later that night, revealed himself with the battle scars
They tried to lock Jesus Christ down, like prison bars
But on the third day he rose, spirit clothed
What a wonderful vision, my Lord's arisen {2X}
