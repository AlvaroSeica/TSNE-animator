[Intro: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
(All you, homeboy...)
Yo, ugh, yeah, heh
I got that 1972 Michael Jackson swagger now, let's do this
This is how I do, this is how I do, yo, what they call you, kid?
Ugh, what the call you? What's your mutha---n' name?

[kung-fu sample w/ Intro]
Ey, I'm getting bored, we've been waiting for hours
They're not gonna come
	You're right!
You talk big, let's see how you fight
	Right!
Right!
And who are you? You'll die here soon enough
	Since you're so keen, we'll give you a fight
Alright then, let's go!

[Cno Evil]
They call me Johnny, can't nobody copy
I do this for a hobby in the back of the lobby
You saying probably, is this MC godly?
Clean New York up like my name is Giuliani
I got the +City Slang Slur+ that be sloppy
Do it for cassettes, CD's and floppies
Yo, I got that flow that be choppy
No seeds, but mamacitas call me papi
Pop your head off like tops on Smirnoff's
Hiatus for the haters, I took a year off
And maybe with that, ya'll can catch up, snatch up
Some of my rhymes, so you can match up
Even Ed McMahon announced, here's Johnny
So +Tonight+ I'mma +Show+ these MC's they can't stop me
They said Johnny get that +Cash+, get it fast
Johnny +Unitas+ and please make it last
And Johnny do it +Daly+ like you was +Carson+
And Johnny +Bravo+, you burn it up like it was arson
Johnny on a +Quest+, to steal the mic without the +Bandit+
We taking over +White Plains+, and smoothly land them
Get it, get it? We smoothly land them
You can't see me, like I'm a phantom
Johnny +B. Goode+ and Johnny be +Handsome+
Your girl might kidnap me for ransom
Then I transform to something much more atrocious
Demonic, bad, devilish, and dark, ferocious
Vicious, wicked, heinous and sinister
Satan hired me as the Hell's gate minister
Diabolical, in this infernal iniquity
Johnny +Blaze+ afraid of this Mephistopheles
So I +Ghost Ride+ his rhymes, for nickels and dimes
The economy sucks, and I need mines
I show 'em lines like, M. Night Shyamalan shows +Signs+
I do it for a +Sixth Sense+ in these hard times
I'm +Unbreakable+ and I know exactly what's +Happening+
For the +Ladies in the Water+, in +The Village+ and Manhattan
Mermaids can't aid the liquid in my brains, man
I +Bring the Pain+ like Meth did way back then, man
I'm like Dracula, they call me the mic +Stoker+
Frankenstein on the mind, as I take over
The Mummy be Musculus, I call him Mick Jagger
Stab you with the dagger, with the Rat Pack swagger
I won't quit (won't quit) not even for a split second
Riggs and Murtaugh, on the mic is +Lethal Weapons+
Tango and Cash, Tubbs and Crockett crack your socket
Hold you upside down and empty your pockets
Just like a cartoon, we plotting your doom
Pointing to the moon, and call your platoon
We still pop your balloons, and digging up your tomb
If we ain't taking over yet, we taking it soon
Yo, shout out to my brother Lil' Gatti
He still got that shotty to your body
And shout out to my brother Bulletz
When the hand on the trigger, you know he gonna pull it
Bolo did it how they did, Jiggs did it how they do
We making movies now you can ask Bazzoo
Stomping through the city like I was a gorilla
Hit up Sue's Rendezvous with that dude Mike Miller
Then we might just call up big Sean
Girls think we phenomenons while we pop thongs
Rule like King Kong, better yet Genghis Khan
Cuz the way I slay the tracks and hold the mic strong, I'm gone...</pre>
