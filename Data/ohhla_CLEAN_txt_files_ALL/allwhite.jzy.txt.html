married to the game
she even got a wedding ring
six white cars and I put that on everything
white benz
white porsch
white bent
white range
white vet
white brains

all white everything [x3]
I'm 'bout to kill 'em this summer
I'm doin' all white everything
[repeat]

I gotta white bent white pit even gotta white bitch
wen I say white I mean whiter den a light switch
white this, white that in my white sox hat
used 2 hide dem white packs where my white socks at
niggas say he so white he tellin a white lie
neva sold no white and he ain't neva see a white pie
man I swear to god I'm being followed by a white guy
on ya boy man I mean harder den a white tie
white roll white wheels whiter den some white pills
white s550 sittin on some white hills
niggas thinkin furs 4 da winter I'm thinkin white fox
pull up in the white ford dually on sum white shocks

married to the game
she even got a wedding ring
six white cars and I put that on everything
white benz
white porsch
white bent

white vet
white brains

all white everything [x3]
I'm 'bout to kill 'em this summer
I'm doin' all white everything
[repeat]

I gotta white lac, white lade both got white suede
big white crib, inside gotta white maid
white sinks, white towels, white rags, white tiles
wen I say white I mean whiter den da white house
white couch, white pillows, white candles, white rugs
since we talkin white jus know I had a white plug
white doors, white walls even got sum white halls
bathroom coat white floors in the white stall
white man, white yard, white trees, white leaves
go and get my mail in a pair of white spike lees
ya'll think I'm trippin wen I say I want a white horse
right inside the 5-9-9 I see the white porsche

married to the game
she even got a wedding ring
six white cars and I put that on everything
white benz

sumwhere on a white beach in some white sand
layin in a white bucket million white snowman
white sky, white clouds, you say it's a white day
white sky, white clouds, I say it look like yay

married to the game
she even got a wedding ring
six white cars and I put that on everything
white benz
white porsch

I'm 'bout to kill 'em this summer
I'm doin' all white everything
