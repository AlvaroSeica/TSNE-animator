[Verse One: Big Boi]
Get the South dick up out your mouth, what are you talking about
See we know everything you're about, so try another route
Paperboy, you can't destroy what we done built
Pick on someone your own size, or fuck around and get killed
But not like the kilt above you knees, BB
Will plant you niggaz like seeds, or fertilizer for the trees
Emergency vehicle last seen speeding from the scene
Nigga, take one for the team now he's bleeding from the spleen
Stay so fresh and oh so motherfucking clean
No blood spatter or evidence, long distance with a beam
We come in peace while some of ya'll niggas come in greed gluttons
Fucking up the game like ice, heroin, or speed, slow down nigga

[Verse Two: Big Boi]
Speed it up like The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, boy go fast
Not a hobby, this my life, you disrespect it, that's your ass
As one half of the Outkast, return like the ghost of Christmas past
It's the son of Chico Dusty, must be West Savannah bad
Had to got to church every Sunday with Great-Grandma and Grandad
Taught me always follow Jesus when the grass didn't have a path
If I ever fell astray, then God will get me back on track
Didn't say that Rico, Ray, and Pat was getting with me and Three Stacks
Then we spitting cuz we killing everything we attack
Special Forces of this rap game, so you best take heed of that
All that shit you rappers lack, we got plenty, here's snack
Don't ruin their appetitie, cuz you shit is really wack
Wack ass nigga

[Outro: Big Rube]
Another battle one, Another story to tell
Listen to the angelic plucking of strings 
As Sir Lucious puts his left foot forward
And rides off into the horizon of infinite regression, victorious
Undefeated on the battle field against the means of ignorance, greed, and hatred
All contenders to the throne are left naked
Because the truth is the only thing you can never be stripped from
And if you want to commit to that truth
Then you could end the vicious cycle that's affecting our youth today
I you just stop lying, if you just stop lying
Stop lying.....lying</pre>
