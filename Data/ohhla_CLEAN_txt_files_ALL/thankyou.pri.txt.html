Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Come on closer with on hand rough
I get afraid and then I walk alone
With my comble if it don't come round
Keeps you wonderin, you don't know how

Beautiful thing, I have to have you near
I'll lay back and I will let you steer
Show me what it's all about
Fill up my ear and so fill up my mouth

Come on baby
I'll give you everything you need
I wanna thank you
Take everything you need

Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

We can always get what we want
So I want whatever that you got
Everything that I have is yours
It's for you who that I do it for

Come on baby
I'll give you everything you need
I wanna thank you
Take everything you need

Come on baby
I'll give you everything you need
I wanna thank you
Take everything you need

Well you know
Where to go
Well you know
I don't

I've waited for so long
We get along

Baby I wanna sleep, we'll sleep in tight
No I've seen the, I've seen the light

Come on baby
I'll give you everything you need
I wanna thank you
Take everything you need

Come on baby
I'll give you everything you need
I wanna thank you
Take everything you need

Come on baby
I'll give you everything you need
I wanna thank you
Take everything you need

Come on baby
I'll give you everything you need
I wanna thank you
Take everything you need

Come on baby
I'll give you everything you need
I wanna thank you
Take everything you need

Come on baby
I'll give you everything you need
I wanna thank you
Take everything you need

Thank you, thank you...</pre>
