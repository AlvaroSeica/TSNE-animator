[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Learn to swim, pledge allegiance to the terror within 
New America, we board the Mothership' with our friends,
Paranoia's old, change is just a means to an end
It seems I lost my freedom again, another ten'
 
I'm too fast for love, self hatred outlasted drugs, 
New prescriptions murking' fast like I'm a splash the club
Shittin' on crews, pissing in puke, sitting on Nukes'
My clicks flooded out like Wackenhut, hidden with kooks
51 stress, William Cooper fell with no vest
Remember Montel? when he caught it he contracted MS
I check for spaceships on desert sands
Infrared's controlling the land
I seen them people jump off the building holding hands
Erase the program, fixing your chip, its where you don't see
It's revolution, except for slaves and things we don't need
Turn it off, as usual the media's here
I haven't touched my television in years
 
[Chorus]
 
Nuclear broadcast, reggae high beams and stretch blazers'
Cia reps dressed in black cloaks like Al'Qaeda
Obsessed wit' data, steel toe speed and green khakis
I need theme music when I kill, like Scorpio from Dirty Harry
My dread pops' like Bad Brains' on airplanes
Wet up your whole block for spare change
Life in the fast lane
Yo its too trife'
Uncle Howie still wit' the pipe
Cause if the suicide bombs on I ruin it right
See me? I'm well known for re-inventing the steel
I'm classic motherfucker I inherit the feel
You fuckin' faggot'
You stay wit' informants and take sausage, You make me nauseous
You ain't gangsta',you work as a florist
A day in the life is just a roll of the dice
Seeing shit bugged, like Shallow Hal' rollin on vic's (vicodin)
The worlds burning kid, Bitches eat out for furnishings
Grand finale, night stalker set with the pentagram and tourniquets
 
[Chorus]
 
The negative creep, rats in the loft
Splatter your corpse
50 karats, you're blingin' from the back of The Source
Rhymes are love and hate
My 9 taurus' sings when it shakes
Peace to my man Germ' serve another 6 upstate
Keep my caine' in the fridge
Any tops rocks in sink
Its the new religion like Hendrix out in Rainbow Bridge
I plead the sixth amendment
I'll leave you crippled with the home attendant
Pissing in tombs, paying dues like I'm the Bad Lieutenant 
Futuristic drive-bys, lasers popping, blood on my scope
Alien face replace the one with the goat
100 days of Sodom, red sun it glow in the streets
Hope collapse rock bottom when the ozone depletes
