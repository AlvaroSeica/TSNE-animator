Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Opportunities
You're knockin' at my door
Grab my pants off the floor
Grab my shoes grab my hat
I think I'm getting fat
Wasted youth wasted lives
We'll see but help me find by
My opportunities
Let's hear it all for opportunity!
Opportunity
I come in the door
Working times really slow
Making $4.25
This job really blows
See the girls gone pass by
I think I'm getting high
But I have my opportunity
Screw it all for opportunity
Come on people say
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Opportunity
Comin' in again we say that opportunity
Comin' in again we say that opportunity
Comin' in again we say that opportunity
We're off to run the tape!</pre>
