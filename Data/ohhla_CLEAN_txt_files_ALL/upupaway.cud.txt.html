[KiD CuDi]
Now when the sun come up
I'll be there to say what up
In the morning brush my teeth
Find that clip I been looking
For since last night
I feel so caught up in a bud
I flow some round in my bedroom, turn around, see myself in the mirror
I guess I'm cool, and no sappy thoughts in my head 
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan, minus the tights
in the first happy to see how far I've come to the same place 
it began: my dream and imaginations
perfectly at peace so I move along a bit higher

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
I'll be up up and away
Up up and away
Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up up and away
Up up and away
Cause in the end they'll judge me any, so, whatever

[KiD CuDi]
I learn, I see the dreams are made so I'm cooler now
I could take care of my mom and my little niece serious so
Sing along lil' mama you ain't gotta worry bout no drama, no 
I'll provide for friends and fam and fans
Cleveland city grinding man stay at flow, the kids hope
I never let a motherfucka break me, dawg
who gives a fuck if a nigga don't like your steeds?
tell em to buzz off your n-u-t's 
We don't care what people say, dude you can take your clothes and ? day
I ain't gotta wait for no one
If I wanna fly I could fly for freedom, hey!

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
I'll be up up and away
Up up and away
Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up up and away
Up up and away
Cause in the end they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

[KiD CuDi]
Wake up wake up wake wake up
Wake up wake up wake wake up
(Yeah!)
Wake up wake up wake wake up
(We'll be rollin' one up)
Wake up wake up wake wake up
(We'll be rollin' one up)
Wake up wake up wake wake up
(We'll be rollin' one up)
Wake up wake up wake wake up
(I be rollin' one up)
Wake up wake up wake wake up

[Chorus: KiD CuDi] (Repeat 2x)
I'll be up up and away
Up up and away
Cause they goin' judge me anyway so whatever
I'll be up up and away
Up up and away
Cause in the end they'll judge me any so whatever

[KiD CuDi]
Whatever..
So, whatever..
Whatever..
So, whatever...

[Common - Narrating]
The end is never the end. A new challenge awaits
A test no man could be prepared for
A new hell he must conquer and destroy
A new level of growth he must confront himself
The machine in the ghost within
This is the journey, of the man on the moon...</pre>
