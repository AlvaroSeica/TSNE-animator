Song:   In the Name of God
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In the name of God you kill in the name of your God
In the name of God you conquered in the name of your God

All religion should be wiped out
So that people may just live
What divides us is an illusion
Made up by men in their confusion

In the name of God you kill in the name of your God
In the name of God you conquered in the name of your God
In the name of God you hate in the name of your God
In the name of God you boast in the name of your God

Spoke of love no one would listen
Seems everyoneOs trying to prove something
Starting over may be the best thing
So stop the bombs and letOs begin

Cause this war no one can win and it seems IOll never learn
Oh this war no one can win well it seems IOll never learn

In the name of God you kill in the name of your God
In the name of God in the name of your God you conquered
In the name of God in the name of your God

All religion should be wiped out
Save the people stand and live
What divides us is an illusion
Made up by men in their confusion

In the name of God you kill in the name of your God
In the name of God you conquered in the name of your God
In the name of God you boast in the name of your God
In the name of God you hate in the name of your God

In the name of your God, why do you kill?, why do you hate?
in the name of God, in the name of God </pre>
