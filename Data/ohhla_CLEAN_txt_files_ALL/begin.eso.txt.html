What have you got there, one of your paintings?
Yes, it's a Work that I'm rather fond of
A Good piece of abstract painting don't you think?
Yeah, it's umm, oh, hmmm, it's Remarkable
It's certainly got a lot of colour
No doubt about that. What does it represent?
It's a picture, an independent entity, there's no reason to imitate something else
Hmm I suppose not, it's just that I'm sort of used
to looking at pictures of people, and object and you know
Why?
Why? Well it's umm ah ummm, why?
If you want a house or a flower you'll go and look at it
or if you want them represented you can have the photographed
so then why allow them to intrude into pictures?
Yeah, yeah umm I guess your right
Well if you young fellows excuse me
I think I'll take the flowers in and put them in some water

Even Though we got 2 albums this one feels like the beginning

Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin</pre>
