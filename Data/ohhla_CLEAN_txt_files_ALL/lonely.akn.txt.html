Lonely I'm so lonely
I have nobody
To call my owwnnn
I'm so lonely, I'm mr. Lonely
I have nobody
To call my owwnnn
I'm so lonely

Yo this one here goes out to all my players out there
ya know got to have one good girl whose always been there
like ya know took all the bullshit
then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave

I won't up in the middle of the night
and I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
coulda sworn I was dreamin, for her I was feenin
so I hadda take a little ride
back tracking ova these few years
tryna figure out what I do to make it go bad
cause ever since my girl left me
my whole left life came crashin

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm mr. Lonely (mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
To call my own (to call my own) girl

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm mr. Lonely (mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
To call my own (to call my own) girl

Can't believe I had a girl like you
and I just let you walk right out of my life
after all I put you through
you still stuck around and stayed by my side
what really hurt me is I broke your heart
baby you were a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
cause without you in my life girl

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm mr. Lonely (mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody to call my own)
To call my own (to call my own) girl

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm mr. Lonely (mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
To call my own (to call my own) girl

Been all about the world ain't neva met a girl 
hat can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
where you would get up and run and I would be out chasing you
Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
ain't no one on the globe I'd rather see
than the girl of my dreams that made me be so happy
but now so lonely

So lonely (so lonely)
I'm mr. Lonely (mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
To call my own (to call my own)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm mr. Lonely (mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
To call my own (to call my own) girrll

Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I jus want you to call my phone
so stop playing girl and come on home (come on home)
baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished I'd ever hurt my baby
and it's drivin me crazy cause..

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm mr. Lonely (mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
To call my own (to call my own)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm mr. Lonely (mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
To call my own (to call my own) girll

Lonely, so lonely
So lonely, (so lonely)
Mr. Lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely, (so lonely), Mr. Lonely</pre>
