Get, get get get get get down
For these choppas spit spit spit spit spit spit rounds
Uptown outa state sha shake sha shake it down
Them boys get them thangs
Bra brake bra brakem down
From the bottom of the pane handle
Where birds get man handle
From a pot to the block with a hand to hand you
Cook that white with Sprite that's if you wanna scandle

Don't pull out unless of course you spit boy
Squeeze out to the bottom of that click boy
Just to reashore yo ass got hit boy
Make 36 O's do a 360 that's a flip boy
It's a bird it's a plane no that's a brick boy

For the 5 thousand dollar drop
