[Verse One]
Let me holla at you true thugs, fo da ones wanna dump slugs
On da corner where dey slang drugs, only God is thicker dan blood
Fo da sake of da luv, know He shedded His blood
Who you thinkin it was, Huh Huh Huh Huh
Had you dumpin dem slugs
Leavin 'em dead, when dey really did needed da luv
Huh! Jiggaz?, cause you got figgaz
You can die quick, you can ride or die or
You can live life wit us, too many on da lockdown
So you better tell 'em all put da glock down
4-mics in da Source think you hot now
While you ridin in yo Chev wit yo top down
All da way from Pompano, to let 'em know
Son, just how da story go, and from Ft. Lauderdale
Where dey make 'em yell, and dey push more weight dan mail
In da MIA where da thugs live and die everyday
In da hood where da mommas cry everyday
Where da kids listen to Slip-n-Slide everyday
(okay - Shut Up)
S. FLA - dat's why we die, in da MIA - dat's why we die
In da dirty south y'all tellin dese lies - dat's why we die
Carolina - dat's why we die
ATL - dat's why we die
Alabama, Mississippi young thugs - dat's why we die

[Chorus]
You got dese young girls backin it up - dat's why we die
You got dese young cats blazin it up - dat's why we die
Cash Money - dat's why we die, No Limit - dat's why we die
Roc-a-fella y'all tellin dese lies - dat's why we die
No Limit - dat's why we die
Murder Inc - dat's why we die
Roc-a-fella - dat's why we die

[Verse Two]
Let me tell you somethin partna you ain't ready to die
Cause you take yo last breath and you close yo eyes
Same ones dat stare you right in yo mouth
Same ones dat run up in yo house
And da ones you thought was down wit you
Hit you up in da back wit a 22
Fo da hell of it, so I'm tellin it
Don't even know who you messin wit
When you husslin everyday in dese streets - dat's drug money
Then you leavin people dead in dese streets - dat's blood money
And then these babiez can't even eat - dat's not funny
Huh Uh - dat's why we die Huh Uh - dat's why we die
Yo words hittin 'em up like a hot slugg
Made da girls wanna bounce in da hot tub
See da pain in her eyes - never knew luv
Let 'em know dat Christ is da true luv
And I Know you drive a big Benz, big body wit da tight endz
Navigators and Escalades sittin on da blades
Cause you wanna get paid, everybody want it nowadays
Black Rob said it's whoa (whoa whoa)
Make you wanna hit da ceilin yo
Cause you make a million sales, sittin in da jail (but he back in jail)
Cause da devil caught you slippin yo, A-Z body wanna flow fo dough
So dey lose dey soul, y'all know how da story go
Know how dese jiggaz is, So dey tellin you
Baby boy I'm a keep it real
But when you need 'em yo, ain't nowhere around, Sonny boy you know da deal
In L.A. - dat's why we die
In NY - dat's whey we die
East and west coast tellin dese lies - dat's why we die

[Chorus]

[D.C.P.]
'78 lil thug killer born into a world of sin
Pimps, coke, fast cash, momma thought I wouldn't last
Born with a pipe in my hand, cause she did what she did to get the blast
Got a little older
Now I'm on the streets with a pocket full of D and the heat
And the cola seeds in the dosha
Beat in the nova trying to succeed, to a key and a bolda
Now rap game got to change like Ford to Chevrolet
Look boy to many of 'em man getting sprayed
Ya boy been slanging yeah since '98, now Florida state got your boy caged
Tell them playboy to let Christ in, bet you 9 out of 10 thugs stay out the pen
Trying to get dividends, so you spit venom in lost souls
Dog now your boy stretching 10 from Calieo
All the way back to the MI - MLK in the shy
Spittin fire reaching them all, while y'all boys trying to ball
And we go fly while y'all boys steady fall
Look through while y'all snorting the coke
Sip mo while we saving a soul
Lip swole cause y'all messing with us
Ain't mean it though, but y'all rustled the bus
Dog you can spark me, go ahead if you please
But every knee gone bow, NY to the Keys
Slip and Slide in the fire, Devil burning 'em up
You can still turn around wody, Lifting 'em up
Navigator truck boy chicks and chains
Ain't nothing to me cat, I'm about making 'em change
Wood grain and 'cain, must pass away
That's why we die lil dog, you gone have to pay

[Chorus]</pre>
