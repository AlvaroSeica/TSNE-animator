Just like what I said
Baby my baby baby my baby my baby
Yeah, Montana
Francis
Drugz

You don't wanna fuck with me I let em go
Tunnel vision on the money I don't see the ho
I guess I am slow said he will always catch me
I ma live it up pop bottles flick it up
Some bitches still my niggaz behind the wall
Tell em I ain't slowing down Nah no at all
I am on the edge till the Niggaz catch me
I ma live it up pop bottles flick it up

Fuckin star I am a astronaut
Baby gon grab a shot
Know I'm tryna slide like rap-alot
Blown back half a block
Trick id rather not
I am from the hood baby I ain't always had alot
And wake up in the morning
Than look up in the ceiling
Another day up in the jungle
On my way up to the million
Lightning up the cig than
Sippin on that lean
Nigga tryna make a killin
Homine nothin in between
Shawty dump me to the morning
Wake up and go to the church
Tryna wash away your sins I guess whatever work
Keep a hammer fucking time
These niggaz getting murkd
Coke Boys on the grind
From the first to the first
Montana

You don't wanna fuck with me I let em go
Tunnel vision on that money I don't see the ho
I guess I am slow said he will always catch me
I ma live it up pop bottles flick it up
Some bitches still my niggaz's behind the wall
Tell em I ain't slowing down Nah no at all
I am on the edge till the Niggaz catch me
I ma live it up pop bottles flick it up

That nigga head up to the sky
Feet on solid grizzale
Haters wont knock me
Off my sway swear I am too rizzale
Hall of Fame bizzale
Perstigious with this hustlin player
Hurry up and stop breathing do yourself the favor
Before I toss the shakers
I kiss em up to god
I know he don't condone don't gamble but this life is hard
See this life of ours
Cold nights of brawls
Whippin white in yalls
Twirling in the nicest cars
Nigga I'm fly than I ever been
Anyting that these niggaz confess to be i never been
All about my presidents
Ima set the prescints
Tell em made the flow
These rappers don't match these measurements
Nahh
Gram still over the stove mixing
I already come up in these coming I'm the most prolific
Chinx drugz get familiar with the name bitchez
When they think they figure me out
Thats when my lane switches

You don't wanna fuck with me I let em go
Tunnel visions on the money I don't see the ho
I guess I am slow said he will always catch me
I ma live it up pop bottles flick it up
Some bitches still my niggaz's behind the wall
Tell em I ain't slowing down Nah no at all
I am on the edge till the Niggaz catch me
I ma live it up pop bottles flick it up</pre>
