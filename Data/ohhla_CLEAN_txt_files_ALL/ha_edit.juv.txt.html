Thats you with that big body benz ha 
Thats you that cant keep an old lady 
Cause you keep nailing her friends ha 
You gotta go to court ha 
You got served a subpeona for child support ha 
That was that nerve ha 
You ain't even get a chance to say a word ha 
I know i ain't trippin don't your brother got their birds ha 
You ready to bust somebody head ha 
You ain't scared ha 
You know how to play it ha 
You no you ain't gone let somebody come and punk you ha 
Stunt and front you ha 
Straight up run you ha 
You know who got that fire green ha 
You know how to use a triple beam ha 
Ain't hard as it seems ha 
You keep your body clean ha 
You got a lot of girbaud jeans ha 
Some of your partners dope fiends ha 
You don't want to really mess with them clowns ha 
You come up with them clowns ha 
You stuck with them clowns ha 
  
Chorus (repeats 2 times) 
  
Is you a paper chaser 
You got the block on fire 
Remaining a gee until the moment you expire 
You know what it is to make nothing out of something 
You handle your biz and don't be cryin and suffering 
  
You can't do nothing but love fresh ha 
You want to know what we gone do next ha 
You brought our tape with a check ha 
You wearing a vest ha 
You tryin to protect your chest ha 
You spent seven years on your benz ha 
That ain't yours that's for your friends ha 
You wanna stop these heads from playing with you ha 
You wanna run the block ha 
You wanna be tha last one with rocks ha 
You keep your gun cocked ha 
You count the money at the end of the night ha 
You on a three day flight ha 
You full of that diesel ha 
You duckin them people ha 
You the one face was on we news last night ha 
You the one robbed them little dudes out they shoes last night ha 
You don't come in the project when it's dark ha 
You claim you a thug and you ain't got no heart ha 
You come in the nolia on new years eve ha 
You got stuck in that bitch and couldn't leave ha 
It was hard for you to breathe ha 
  
Chorus (repeats 2 times) 
  
Is you a paper chaser 
You got the block on fire 
Remaining a gee until we moment you expire 
You know what it is to make nothing out of something 
You handle your biz and don't be cryin and suffering 
  
You got a trespassing charge ha 
You got on a hard on when you were looking at them little broads ha 
You don't know when to quit ha 
That's you with that shot calling click ha 
That's you with that balling click ha 
That's you thats taking them hits ha 
Your girl don't know when to shut up her mouth ha 
You gone give her grief ha 
You done switched from nike to reebok ha 
You twinkle your gold everytime you leave your house ha 
Them income tax checks out ha 
You bout to flip that ha 
You bout to go buy you a gram ha 
You bout to go treat your nose ha 
You bout to go put the dope d on one of these ho's ha 
When you broke you drove ha 
When you paid you got bookoo places to go ha 
You on top ha 
You don't think you can be stopped ha 
You robbin somebody shop ha 
You ridin in the benz on 20 inch rims ha
