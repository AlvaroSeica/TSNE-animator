[Intro: ShoGun Assason]
Yeah fuck it, yeah, yeah
I don't give a fuck who you know
What you did, but check it
I don't give a fuck who you know
And what you did...

[Chorus: ShoGun Assason]
Blast for them, niggas who ain't here
Blast for them, niggas who don't care
We blast for them, yeah, yo, we blast for them

[ShoGun Assason]
Yo, I'm taking it back to the block now
I got four-fours and glocks now
I'm bout to aim for you head now
Duck down, beef, the grief
It's official, that I sent those missiles out to get you
Really meant to hit you, angry that they missed you
Don't pardon me, because I'm glock happy
I'm a south side rap cat, get at me
I grip trey pounds, I'm better than that
That'll loosen your ball cap, fuck ya'll niggas
Step back for me, or how about kill a nigga
From where guns is born, where beef gets torn

[Chorus]

[Outro: ShoGun Assason]
Huh? I got the top burning, burning the block
Get the trigger.. I got the top burning, burning ya block </pre>
