[Talking: Lupe Fiasco]
Look at what we did
Came a long way from dirty ghetto kids
Yeah, look at what we did
We came a long way from dirty ghetto kids

Ha... uh, uh... c'mon...

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Well the cops didn't fine 'em for grindin, no
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go
Plus he had to be at home a long time ago
And he had made like ten dollars of the song he wrote
It read:
"A lil hungry, and need a lil money
It's for my lil sister and her lil tummy"
Wasn't lyin tho, he didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
Cause he knew they wasn't cookin where he live
The coo ca coo ca coots now took him to the crib
A lil hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
Right pass the pushers who couldn't under dig
What's the use of pushin? U ain't pushin none of this
If I kick it with y'all I'm just pushin for a bid
But what was on his mind, and push him to the lid
Their best customer wasn't cookin for her kids
Gets up to pump, so he

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, and so he
Kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, you see his mom was a crack head
And his father couldn't be contacted
He knew that being different was combated
Amongst the other things in his young, black head
And see his girl was a white girl
But just cause she was white, see her life wasn't light world
She too had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a mama, but her daddy used to mama hit
Daddy caught something chasin fatties, made her mama sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped her to the pharmacist
And suicidal feelings would rise
Switch over the transition, till her conquer it
Pays for mama's pills with a sponsorship
Her cell phone bill and a Honda kit
Uh huh, and that's why she skates with he
Someone to feel the pain and a place to be
That's why, that's why, that's why, she

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, that's why she
Kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, a traveling band of misfits and outcasts
A lot of scars, they did this without pads
A lot of hearts who did this without dads
Ones father was filthy rich
Two was middle class, and one was homeless
And the paralyzed girl in the wheelchair
Who just liked to watch, and that was the whole clique
I think about 'em everytime I see this old flick
L's taken in the park in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, "we thankful, push, kick
Hope you make a video, the beat is so sick"
Well I did, I hope you seen it
It's on MTV, Soundtrakk's a genius
Love from Tony Hawk, beat from the Ice Creamaz
Before we put it out, had to pay the Philippines
Just to show you how you

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Kick, push
Over ya shoulders you swore you'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, that's why you
Kick, push
Over ya shoulders you swore you'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive

Yeah</pre>
