Album:  Da Game Owe Me 
Song:   N God We Trust 
Typed by: Detreceiver2g@aol.com 

In God we trust, in God we trust. 
I waited patiently for God to help me 
Then he listened and he heard my cry 
He has given me a new song to sing our praises to our God on high. 
Now many will hear of the glorious things he did for me 
And stand in awe before the Lord, and put their trust in Him. 
Oh God of the armies of Heaven 
Blessed are those who trust in you, trust in you. 

First Verse: 

True is to it 
But I did not do it by myself, ya dig? 
Bet you often wonder how this youngster's bump is super sick
Bet you wonder how you breathe? 
Bet you wonder why the leaves 
Fall up off the trees 
In the Fall, but this what Fly believe 
Fly believe in G-O-D 
Fly believe in S-P-V 
Fly believe in M-2-3, and this for L-I-F and E
Devilish fools make Satanic moves 
Breakin' golden rules 
Doin' what they choose will quickly send them to eternal snooze 
Lookin' at every group that is produced by Fly are holdin' hands 
Of the Holy man 
I stand beside and call upon, so should my fans 
If you down with Flizy, or live in a sound mind 
Like love and hate, between life and death 
It sure is a thin line 
And lizines (lines) get crizzossed (crossed) 
Devils get tizzosed (tossed) 
Angels get hizigh (high) 
But no time gets lizost (lost) 
You must want to wizalk (walk) 
The talk you tizalk (talk) 
You should have repented when Fly said time was shizort (short) 
And Fly won't get kizaught (caught) 
Instead I'm gone rush, I'm gone thrust 
With Minnie Mae 
Passin' demonic haters, traitors 

Chorus: 

In God we trust 
Fly true to this game til' Fly bust 
Til' my body bites the dust, Fly ain't tryin' to give this up 
In God we trust 
I'm true to this game til' Fly bust 
Til' my body bites the dust, I ain't tryin' to give this up 
I'm gone ball, I'm gone fall, upon God Fly gone call 
It don't matter what's the cause 
And Flizy tellin' this to y'all, in God we trust 

Second Verse: 

It's true like Devil's in disguise, plenty blessings in disguise 
If you wanna peep 'em, you can see 'em with your inner eyes 
Any day, that's every day, cuz  every day you wake and shake 
Just a normal blessing that you catch but pay attention late 
Wake and yawn in the morn, at the crib gettin' up 
Or two o' clock in the A.M. in the club gettin' real buck 
He gone make his prescence felt 
He's my guiding light and help 
And help me keep my faith when on the run or takin' sliding steps 
Givin' more than satisfaction 
Off the Wall like Michael Jackson 
Excellence of expertise has helped me be the main attraction 
Just to get attention with 
Even bear to witness this 
Flowers are to be praised or to be raised, but this one I whipped 
This the deal and Fly won't fake it 
Take it how you wanna take it 
Flizy gonna tell what God lizuv (love) to make sure Flizy make it 
Push and shove and people love it 
You decide the way you ridin' 
And if you ride this way, then makin' pay won't be your only prize 
So look into the situation 
Put aside your fame and wealth 
And you might find somethin' you can cherish more than life itself 

Chorus 

Third Verse: 

And now that I have wrote it, I wonder what you'll think about it 
Will you say it's Gospel rap or would you say "That brotha bout it"? 
I wonder, but don't care about your opinion I just state the facts 
No matter what I do, or what I did with Him I stay intact 
Too legit was not my style 
I preferred to buck and wild 
And I would always pray for better days, that would come after while 
Things got better, things got worse, and man it hit me where it hurts 
And took the Father of this only son six feet up under dirt 
He dimmed the lights upon my stage 
A light, but they closed the curtain 
So Bill is still Gettin' It On, Movin' On, and this for certain 
And since he's not here with me, you think I come alizone (alone)? 
But Bill Chill shines off in me, with God in his whole King-dom 
I'm still standin' strizong (strong) 
And waitin' on my thrizone (throne) 
And live for the dizzay (day) that God calls me hizome (home) 
Until then I'll rizzoam (roam), the face of the Izzerth (Earth) 
And shoot for the stizars (stars), on days of my bizzerth (birth) 
And play in the dessert that God put here for us 
And you come play with me 
If my God you trust 
Who you trust? 

Chorus (2x) 

SOUTH SUCKA!!!!!!!!</pre>
