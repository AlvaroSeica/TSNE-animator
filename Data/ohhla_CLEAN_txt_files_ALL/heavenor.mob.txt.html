(*talking*)
Our father, who art in heaven
Hollow be thy name, by kingdom come
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven
Jesus give us this day, or daily bread
Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those, who trespassed against us
Is it heaven or hell

[Crooked Eye]
The devil got me blinded by the money, yeah material wishes
Expensive cars power moves, and bad ass bitches
Growing up in the ghetto, with drug dealers and killers
Around these two faced friends, and cut throat niggaz
Lord if I lose the battle, tell me is my destiny hell
My enemies catch me slipping, murder me for the mail
Am I doomed if they kill me, before I repent
Cause selling dope and living in sin, is how my life was spent
See I'm a rider, it seems like I'm lost at heart
Trying to find my way to the light, before they tear me apart
But leave you down on the cross, and pay the ultimate cost
I heard him scream, as he seen the black mini 14
Saw the look in his eyes, as bullets flying out the beam
Saw the look on his face, hope his soul's prepared
Rest in peace to my homies, either heaven or hell
It's either heaven or hell

[Chorus: Mo B. Dick]
It's either heaven or hell, (it's either heaven or hell nigga)
(tell me where will you dwell), yeah
Out there, hustling for that mail (it's either heaven or hell)
(out there hustling for mail)
It's either heaven or hell, (it's either heaven or hell nigga)
(tell me where would you dwell nigga)
Tell me, where will you dwell (out there hustling for mail)

[Billy Bavgate]
Picture this, niggaz cry like they love me
Behind my back niggaz saying fuck me, looking at me ugly
I know now, motherfuck these niggaz to my funeral
I feed em bullets through my barrel, I'll probably die by the barrel
Dear God, I don't wanna die like the Pharaoh
I live my life as a strong man, I got the faith
But these niggaz in the world, love to player hate
I wanna go to heaven, exhale
They screaming like the nigga'z in jail
Bavgate got a story to tell
My homie caught twelve, trying to get mail
Nigga you a snitch, if you tell
Real G's stay on they knees, thanking God
For everytime they breathe, the world turns niggaz burn
Like the devil through a bullet
You thinking that you lived your life, to the fullest
Nigga, it's either heaven or hell
Where would you dwell, tell me is it heaven to hell

[Chorus]

(*talking*)
This goes out to all my fallen soldiers man
This goes out to all the fallen soldiers, (it's either heaven or hell)
G-Nut, Cole, I miss you niggaz (tell me where will you dwell)
Seem like we trapped in hell right now
With our back against the wall, we gon' ball though
Lord forgive us for our sins, for we know not what we do
(heaven or hell), it's either heaven or hell nigga
So tell me where would you dwell nigga
(where will you dwell), it's either heaven or hell
Tell me, hustling for mail
(heaven to hell), it's either heaven or hell nigga</pre>
