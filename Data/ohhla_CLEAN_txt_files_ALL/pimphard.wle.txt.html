Song:   Pimp Hard
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I keep my, brim low
My eyes even lower
Nigga I'm not high, but it's hard for me to focus cause
My chain, that chain it be glowin'
Brighter than hazard lights
So I'm likely on the shoulda
My, kicks clean, yeah I can chauffeur
Sure I am focused, check the way my toes purr
I'm el gato, they hot and I got those
You ain't got cheese like tacos, they nachos
Tot bosco
I don't play I'm jake voscal
Niggaz make cake like harpo
Ya'll soft when ya talk I hear the harps pull
She like me cause my whip that's what I call a carpool
They carpool wale
The seats cheescake but the car sorbet
Shore bet, yeah I'm the flyest of the lyricists
Even on an off day my fit-a praise for a grip
Northface don
My... ?
Why ya'll niggaz stay involved with that lova on the phone

[Chorus: x2]
Pimp hard
Oh lord there he go again
Any disbelievers, is believing we be showin' em
Oh nah, so far he be doin that
I can give it to you niggaz what you gonna do with it?

See I
Get dough, my clothes more superior
Seriously err'body askin' where I get 'em from
I be in, my double R jeans'n
I don't skateboard but a brother SB'in
I'm on that fly shit
That you ain't got shit
That if u copped, wouldn't know how to rock shit
They wearin' van shit
I underhandedly slammed 'em
With that fire sittin' on this man's foot
Got my dunks on but they look like sneakers
Look at me people my shoe games ether
Pledge my allegiance to swoosh, fuck beastin'
Sneakers that look like slippers and cheap jumps
Sneaker man and ducky, they gon' hold me down
We doin' major in 06
Ask around
I'm what they hopin bout
I'm what they boast for
I'm who they raisin they glass and have a toast for
Put your cups up like implant
For the rap Rembrandt
Creatine dough,
My wallet is a gym rat,
Sets and reps until my account swoll up
Miguel tejada, getting my o's up

[Chorus: x2]
Pimp hard
Oh lord there he go again
Any disbelievers, is believing we be showin' em
Oh nah, so far he be doin that
I can give it to you niggaz what you gonna do with it?</pre>
