[Chamillionaire]
I might pull my ice out and there went all the lights-out
Ice white as the white house or bright as a light house
Ask the governor of Galvaston and he gon' tell ya, we ball
Bout to change the C-Wall to the damn C in P-Wall
All, look at the screens fall can you stunt like we? Nah
More shoes, clothes and hoes then 4 stores in the mall
See more legs, breast and thighs then a plate with 3 chickens
I don't steal but the pist-ol ya whole set of, teeth missin'
I'ma walkin' website, internet on my damn cell
Open up my nextel, and you-you got mail
I'm to busy, damn who is he?
More throwed then a threw frisbee
Driving too fast you'll miss me
Cuz my twinkies made ya too dizzy
If you see us at the Kappa, on no swangers and adapters
You have my permission to walk up, to me inside and slap us
If I'm not in a flag ship, being jocked by bad chicks
Wearin' coogI bad clips you can give me a ass kick
Sir Daily I stunt with him
When I'm up in the Confadan
With a couple of twins, wearing nothin but comfortable skin
Might pull my cash out, Chamillionaire's a damn grouch
Screen recline and, lay down like a fat man on a black couch
I'm as throwed as a toad on a Budweiser commercial
Wise-Wise Er-Er, look don't make me hurt you
Bout to change after the Kappa, to after the Koopa
Cuz when it comes to ballin', yall niggaz come after King Koopa
Call me King Of The Kappa, when I'm seen in ya city
My screens fall and hang down like ya grandmama's titties
I'm off the (sound), oops I mean I'm off the heezie man
Could go platinum if I did a album with the Ku Klux Klan</pre>
