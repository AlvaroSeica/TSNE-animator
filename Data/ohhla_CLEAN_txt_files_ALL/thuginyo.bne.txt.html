[Intro: Layzie]
35 million records sold, times that by five niggaz
365 days of the year nigga
I'ma tell all you bitches y'all need to put some MOTHERFUCKIN
(Can you buy that?) Thug in your life

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Put some thug in yo' life, right? Eyein the kite, slide
Fight over the mic and we take a ride deep to the third site
Bryon you right right, Krayzie you tight tight
Layzie I love you with my life, and Wish and Flesh in flight
Thug in yo' life, right? Eyein the kite, slide
Fight over the mic and we take a ride deep to the third site
Bryon you right right, Krayzie you tight tight
Layzie I love you with my life, and Wish and Flesh in flight

[Bizzy Bone]
Give me the crossbow, hatchet, I catch it, your twenty I match it
Hit 'em like Sac-Town, King's style (brr) Bronski tragic
Magic, I tell 'em my gun spit swords, I split the Ouiji board
What about that oracle, chloroform, puckers I'm sure
Straw hat, bald head, Delilah, I can't call it
Crawlin, walkin in this flesh and yes I'm ballin
Talkin, Ramen Noodle, we in nigga, y'all in?
How many angels? Let's call Jesus, many men fall in
Maulin gangsta gangsta, yes my life's in danger
Never a stranger, Christ, sermon in this motherfuckin manger
Chuck Norris, Texas Ranger, weapon tucked, in my Wranglers
Coochie cuttin in stranger, existence praise you Creator
One time, make us major with Christ, make us some {?} shook
Like Venus razors, better re-operate it, playa playa
Layzie, yeah you know we gon' get arrested all day
We gon' do this one for Jesus, rock steady baby

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
Rock steady baby, we rock steady baby
We gon' do this one for Jesus, we rock steady baby
Thug style baby, we rock steady baby
We gon' do this one for Jesus, we rock steady
I'm the real soldier boy; I don't dance, I just boogie
I'm thugged out like a motherfucker in the cut where the crooks be
Nigga take a look see, how me and B.B. move the crowd
They say them Bone Brothers is over with, I think they thought they'd take the style
Have a nigga +Wild 'n Out+, but I ain't Nick Cannon
I pull the cannon up outta my sleeve, you gon' die, goddamn it
Access granted; granted to the coldest show in town
Nigga don't panic, on this planet, we the coldest niggaz around
You heard the sound, been puttin it down, nigga you really wanna test this rep?
One step, you gon' need help, this shit get bad for yo' health
I'm like a step bomb baby, armored up in teflon baby
Fuckin with your boy Lil' Layzie, you gon' respect mine baby
It ain't no question just hate me, these streets and music done raised me
I'm livin large, shit is gravy, it's "Fuck you, just pay me"
That's how it was in the '80s, how we got through the '90s
Now I'm a new millenium Thugsta, all about perfect timin (c'mon) nigga

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
You niggaz in trouble when I make a call, it ain't goin down if I ain't involved
Thug style, whylin out, gettin it in, and +Canibal+
Problem solved, I found my dog, the rest of y'all niggaz can lick on my balls
I'm steam rollin you niggaz, that's all, mean muggin you niggaz so raw

[Bizzy Bone]
Been mashin the teeth, passin the test, never surpress the love
Because all of us of Allah, grandfather, up above
In the end of days, in the end of plagues, when the new phase is perfection
All recollections of the child can be saved with a blessin
Father God

[Layzie Bone]
Money and power will end in an hour, rappin is me, you niggaz is cowards
Figure you're tough then give me a holla, that thang called respect, I got a lot of
I'm 'bout a dollar, poppin my collar, you motherfuckers ain't witness it yet?
Here it is like a blast to your chest, World Wide Web, Siccness.net

[Bizzy Bone]
Cleanin my feet while I'm walkin with my boombox blastin
Any inclination with no illusions, use yo' gift for conclusions
And I'ma erase any intrusion stores the sense of emotions
My everything rubber past passion East Coast and Mimosas toastin

[Chorus]</pre>
