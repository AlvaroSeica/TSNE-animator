Song:   Believe
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

What do you believe, what do you believe, believe, believe, believe
what do you believe
what do you believe
what do you believe
[Repeat as background during all Choruses]

[Chorus 1]
Everybody needs something to see
something to feel
and something to be, yeah-eah
everybody needs something as proof
something in hand
to know the truth [x3]

Livin lavish like the Biltmore
what the blood spilt for
a ship in harbor is safe
but that ain't what it's built for
do all I can to help you get more
if you forgive my slight intrusion
I see this night is confusin'
a constant fight with illusions
shed a light on conclusions
what you desire is a way out
day in and day out
do not disturb signs
so I'll stay out
how long will you let the torture grasp you
I see spirits manifestin'
blockin' blessings with the questions
that you hear me ask you
keep it up so much will pass you
you can make it on a prayer
yeah, that's true
but barely getting' by, when you can do more
why would you want to
forgettin' that the wood's dry and the fire's on you
life's a hassle, be prepared to rassle
it can be rough
but it don't have to
you can make it full of smiles
somethin' to laugh to
so pick and choose
my message thick
so squeeze and watch it ooze
make it a game to where your fears lose
let's go.

[Chorus 1 x2]

There's a way that seems right
in the heart of a man
and many angels of light
in disguise destroyin' man
so most choose to refuse
the absolute truth
replace it with lies
use ignorance as excuse
it's hard to conceive
what the mind can't comprehend
and harder to believe
what the eyes can't understand
we look to theory, philosophies and thought
for a sure foundation
in a belief we once sought
while the shadow of truth
cast an image so clear
the closer it gets
we reject it out of fear
if we really wanted truth
we would give our lives for it
walk in its direction of light
for God's glory
the saga continues
cause most hearts are deceived
if we really wanted truth
we would live and believe
so the saga continues
cause most hearts are deceived
if we really wanted truth
we would live and believe in it.

[Chorus 1]

yeah

[Chorus 1 x3]

[Chorus 2]
Everybody needs something as proof
something in hand
to know the truth
everybody needs something to see
something to feel
and something to be, yeah</pre>
