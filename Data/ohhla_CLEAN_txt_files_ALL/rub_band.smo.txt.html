[Intro]
And I was like, roll that shit
Light that shit, smoke it
Roll that shit light that shit smoke it (till the rubber band pops)
Roll that shit, light that shit
Smoke it, (licking off shots till the rubber band pops)
And I was like, roll that shit
Light that shit, smoke it
Roll that shit light that shit smoke it (till the rubber band pops)
Roll that shit, light that shit
Smoke it, (licking off shots till the rubber band pops)

[Verse 1]
Dope bagging in Volkswagens
Got Tokes bragging to his bro Satchin
Telling him about the doe stacking
He thought his ho napping but she really texting
Recollecting, all the times she was subjected
To sitting in the car, while he smoking cigars
Full of ganja, puffing around, don't give a fuck
About her fucking lungs and mental health
And now she's gonna stab him in the back n take the cash for herself
They bundled him, into a cab in Camden
Man they grabbed him, and then jabbed him in the Adams Apple
Stabbed him in the abdomen
Then they abandoned him, took about ten grand with them
And the cash she handed, disbanded, they never found em
But she didn't get far, hands bound by her bra
I think I took it too far
Now we got this chick in the car
Take her to harvester car park and harvest her
Organs to pawn 'em, quite appalling you are Mister

[Chorus]
Stacking em notes
Until the rubber band pops
Rubber band pops, rubber rubber band pops
Hitting mad shots, cops, up in them spots
Up in em spots, up a up in em spots
Filling up blocks with my runners and shots
Runners and shots
Runner runners and shots
Licking off shots, till the rubber band pops
Rubber band pops, rubber rubber band pops

[Verse 2]
Safe crackers grey matter sprayed back
Since way back, my heist game remained dapper
Gay chatter made you sound like
Queerest fella, trying to tickle with the nearest feather
Make you fear this cellar, you'll be here forever
Tied up in a basement by a bloke whose called Jason
Wearing a real scary mask so he don't show his face
And it's amazing how a good raping
Provides an escape from the daily grind, wait rewind
I think I'm turning to Satan
Like a master mason
Watching while I'm masturbating
I've mastered debating, ask me anything
The answers waiting
And I'm a bad mutherfucker
Shepard of the anus
Committing heinous crimes
Spitting rhymes of a sadist
Yo, we started off great, we were mates
Just fucking hand slapping
Now I'm ransacking the room that his gran sat in
Feds were gathering the proof
On the cannabis and loot
Outside my yard, vans with the cameras in the roof now

[Chorus x2]

Stacking em notes
Until the rubber band pops
Rubber band pops, rubber rubber band pops
Hitting mad shots, cops, up in them spots
Up in em spots, up a up in em spots
Filling up blocks with my runners and shots
Runners and shots
Runner runners and shots
Licking off shots, till the rubber band pops
Rubber band pops, rubber rubber band pops

[Outro]
And I was like, roll that shit
Light that shit, smoke it
Roll that shit light that shit smoke it (till the rubber band pops)
Roll that shit, light that shit
Smoke it, (licking off shots till the rubber band pops)
And I was like, roll that shit
Light that shit, smoke it
Roll that shit light that shit smoke it (till the rubber band pops)
Roll that shit, light that shit
Smoke it, (licking off shots till the rubber band pops)</pre>
