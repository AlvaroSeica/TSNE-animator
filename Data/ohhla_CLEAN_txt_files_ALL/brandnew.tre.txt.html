[Trey Songz]
Oh, oh, oh, Sooonnnggg, oh
Songz is my name... yup!
Shawty brand new (brand new) fresh out the box (fresh out the box)
I think she came here with her girlfriend
Shawty brand new (brand new) fresh out the box (fresh out the box)
Tonight I'm gon' be yo' husband

[Trey Songz]
S-s-s-s-soon as girl step up in the club
All the fellas try and hide to say what's up
But, me I play it cool, just like chess I know the rules
And, I bet I checkmate her in like 4 moves
I-I-I-I-I'ma say girl what'cha drinkin on, 'Tron
And, sh-sh-she drink it straight, cause she like it strong
G-G-G-Girl I wanna leave with you so we can get it on
Is this is the last call and this is the last song
She said boy...

[Chorus]
Shawty brand new (brand new) fresh out the box (fresh out the box)
Yeah, I came here with my girlfriend
Shawty brand new (brand new) fresh out the box (fresh out the box)
Tonight I'm gon' be her husband
S-S-So let's just take our clothes off, let's just take our clothes off
S-S-She sippin' on that liquor, I'm tyrna get her to the house
G-G-Girl let's just take our clothes off, let's just take our clothes off
S-She said she brand new i'm tryna see what that's ab-bou-bou-bou-bou-bou-bout

[Trey Songz]
She said she ain't even looking for a dude
But, if you with a winner then you know you can't lose
A-A-A-All red on the bottom of ya' shoes
So, I already know you gotta have loot
A-Ain't got a lot of time so I won't spend it
Talkin' like these lame niggaz paper that they ain't spending
Can you dig it, girl I wanna leave with you so we can get it on
Is this is the last call and this is the last song
She said boy I'm...

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
She said she ain't tryna be no one night creep
But, you ain't never had one night with me
Come ride with me, girl you gon' see
There's no place else you'd rather be
Nothing else I'd rather see
Eyes on you, what you gone do?
So brand new, you know what I wanna do
Open you up (yup!)
S-S-So let's just take our clothes off, let's just take our clothes off
Let's girl, let's just, let's just, let's just take our clothes off
Gir-Gir-Girl let's just take our clothes off, let's just take our clothes off
Girl you brand new so le-le-let's just take our clothes off
She said boy I'm...

[Chorus]
