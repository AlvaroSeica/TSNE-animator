(It's The Purple Tape)

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Detroit killin it, NC killin it
Rapper Pooh and Black Milk, you feelin it?
It's The Purple Tape, it's The Purple Tape
Detroit killin it, NC killin it
Rapper Pooh and Black Milk, you feelin it?
It's The Purple Tape, it's The Purple Tape

People checkin for bars
They overlook metal, and settle for them plastic cars
We are enameled with stars who are enamled with flaws
We disregard cause they don't sound like ours
And we ain't earn it like we used to
Surviving in this recession, is really gettin crucial
They stealin more than goods for the next man
They readin playbooks, got ya next plan
Memorized like the wrinkles of ya back hand
We all artists these days, show me where the fans
7-8 deep, packed in a van
Across the US, we travellin
See many of my dreams unravellin
Just because I ain't had the right packaging
The Lord put me here, no accident
Sorry officer, nah I ain't trafficking
Every day, new city, same raps again
See the track that I'm on, how many laps to win?
..Safe sex, I'm practicin
Cause them groupie broads try and trap you in
Hey hey hey, +What's Happening!!+
Hard Bs' need to pack it in
Last call baby doll, get a glass of gin
Tell 'em Rapper Big Pooh, I'm plasterin
my name, I try without the fame
But the money seem to always change
Call me strange... and when I'm done</pre>
