{"It's a dirty rotten shame..."}

[Travie McCoy]
This is not novelty, this is nothing delicate
This the result of a Google search for somethin irrelevant
Stake claim immediately, cause hot products cool down
at which point they'll flock to new sounds
Take fame intravenously; but when nature turns to habit
I'll be sure to leave the scene we started stagnant
This is nothing fraudulent; this is that sure shot
itchy finger lingering behind your target audience
You got 'em all convinced but we ain't buyin it buddy
Demand for lies is high and you're supplyin it
Truth is brutal, it consumes you if you let it
Type that in your little away message and set it

[Chorus]
  Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep, just like I'm counting sheep
  Keep singing songs for me
Man you're boring me wit your monotony
  Keep singing songs for me
Just following the leader wit'cha blah blah blah
  Keep singing songs for me
that I can write in my sleep, just like I'm counting sheep

[Travie McCoy]
And this is not a fashion statement, it's elegant intuition
Far beyond your bed wetter kindergarten compositions
This is a part of me - how can you sleep at night?
when what you don't bite you write half-heartedly?
Go join the army - and be the best you can be
Give new meaning to blowing up overseas
Please~! We kick them doors down when nobody would let us in
And give you that proverbial taste of your own medicine
We took your formula, and relabelled it
and sat patiently and giggled it when you drank it
See poison street cred with just about the same
The flesh not be advanced, pop bottles and dropped names
And you'll dismiss it cause it isn't what you're used to
but who the fuck died and made you King Koopa?

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
Wow congratulations on your new purchase
I heard you bought a crib on Biters Block downtown Plagiarism's Paradise
You're not a movement, you're - purely amusement
The poster boy for Xerox and the role model for parasites
You serve no purpose, you're purely decorative
And - bore us to death with your auditory sedatives
"Oh! They don't see" No, we don't sleep
And hog tie your runaway bride with cold feet
We built this city, on lock and load logic
and burned it down the same night
So go ahead and put your tears on ice baby, I think we got a winner
And kiss your crucifix your boy's a certified sinner

[Chorus] - 2X

{"It's a dirty rotten shame..."} - 2X</pre>
