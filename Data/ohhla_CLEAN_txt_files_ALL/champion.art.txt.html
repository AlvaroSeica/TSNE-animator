(Verse 1)
Moment of silence for the champions
For those who make goin hard a lifestyle
Never wait for nothin, gotta get it right now
I'm in the spotlight when they turn the lights down
Only the champs win the hardest in the twelfth round
I love the fourth quarter, I love the ninth inning
I love game seven, bring on the competition
Cause in my heart; can't nobody do it better
Can't slow me down, won't stop me; never
I'm so Cassius Clay, I'm Tyson in the crown
You don't leave with it, I'm Barry Bonds with mine
I beat the buzzer baby, my stroke is hole in one
You see the checkered flag? Finish, now here I come
And I ain't gotta brag, I let the trophies do it
Around here we the best, now come and hold me to it
I specialize in everything that can't be done
Ain't no more talkin 'bout it, moment of silence for the champions

(Hook, Unidentified male vocalist) [ ] = Ron Artest
They say we warriors, they say we did it again
[Hands high for the champions]
We are victorious, we only in it to win
[Stand up for the champions]
No surrender and no retreat, we take the battlefield over every time
[Aye, clap yo hands for the champions]
We came, we saw, we conquered everything in sight
[Moment of silence for the champions]
Ayyye yo, aye yo, aye yo
That's the sound you hear from the crowd when we come through
[They screamin]
Ayyye yo, aye yo, aye yo
We run the town here, can't you tell when we come through
[They screamin]
The champions
[Cause we are]
The champions
[They screamin]
The champions
[Cause we are]
The champions
Can't nobody handle us
There ain't no competitors
No wonder why we are
We are the champions

(Verse 2)
You read the newspapers, you saw the magazines
You got the internet, but you ain't gotta Google me
My name is up in lights, my face is well-known
You see us, Superbowl; dancin in the end-zone
You see us takin shots of vodka out the stainless cup
You see us runnin out, tellin 'em what the? Fire it up
And in my heart; can't nobody do it better
Can't slow me down, won't stop me; never
I'm Dale Earnhardt, I'm so Micheal Phelps
So many gold medals, too many title belts
I started off state, and came up from there
Now I'm the world champ, and reppin everywhere
Call me incredible, work that pic impeccable
I did it for the decimals, and now I can't let it go
I specialize in everything that can't be done
Ain't no more talkin 'bout it, moment of silence for the champions
