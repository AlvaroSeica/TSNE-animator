{*scratched from GangStarr's "The Militia", spoken by Guru*}
"One of us.. equals many of us..
 Disrespect one of us.. you'll see plenty of us.."

[Eon]
C'mon, c'mon.. c'mon, c'mon..
C'mon, c'mon.. ahh .. (yeah!)

[Cage]
You want Cage in the flesh, paper wants ink to bless
You see me in the streets be glad I spit this stress
Punch through your chest and rip your spine out
Now that Cage got your back you can spit that rhyme out

[Eon]
I'm stompin on these chatroom fakes
whose hip-hop coincides with them cheesy remakes
You little kids playin the critics hard
Go back to your other hobby - Pokemon cards

[Cage]
Local MC's won't start it - DONE
On the mic I make more faces than the retarded son
Minstrel, doin a hump, takin a dump
The life of Cage, take drugs, pass out, wake up in the cunt

[Eon]
I got this e-mail from your female
She's meetin me, suckin me off of three tails
Don't discuss the details, "Hee hee I won't!"
Leave a dollar on the nightstand and watch E bail

[Chorus: scratched by DJ Mighty Mi]
"Once again.. this is it.."
	"Smut Peddlers"
"Tearin up the industry.."
	"Sendin kids back to the lab for more practice"
"Once again.. this is it.."
	"Smut Peddlers"
"Tearin up the industry.."
	"Amazing feats happen when we come out to play"

[Eon]
I'm livin in a monotone paisley
Look into my eyes and all you see is hazy
Somethin out of dark ages paintings, smiles can't hide
Think I'll sit back and watch life go by

[Cage]
In about, four sex acts a cheerleader will begin to bleed
Then we'll bring you up to speed on the orange deed
My seeds procreate I ejaculate grown infants
then blow shotties in they face to finish the sentence

[Eon]
The fact is, you suck like 'Ishtar' does
Dick Starbuck and Cage spark dust up
Yeah I stuck around like your Plymouth's car rust
Fuck your startin five, the startin three ARE us

[Cage]
Stick my dick in almost any hole 
if I got plastic on and my Toxic Avenger mask is on
Celebrate like my pops when his bastard was born
Stretch the pussy like some starlet tryin to last in porn

[Chorus]

[Cage]
This is the meaty part of the discussion
Slice the underbelly of my hunger jelly, splash the scene
Crashed the Beam in half then laughed, I ain't shook(?) shaft
Put another hole in your head to stash my fist
and slash your wrists, with a "Porn Again" CD
Cracked the jar then the cigar then it goes to E

[Eon]
I'm in a trance with the evilest glance
My moral obligation is the feeblest stance
Anti-semetic dipshits, wearin Polo
Y'all ever heard of Ralph Lipschitz?
Oh no, check my aura, in 3-D photos
Whether at regular speed or super slow-mo

[Chorus]</pre>
