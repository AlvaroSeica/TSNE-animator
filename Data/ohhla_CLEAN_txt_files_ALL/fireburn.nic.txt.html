Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Nicki Minaj]
You shoulda left... the other day
You let me beg... for you to stay
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
And so I pray you burn in Hell, and you never find the ocean

[Chorus]
I hope your fire (fire...) fire burns baby
I hope your fire (fire...) fire burns baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
And when you're reachin out for me, you'll see you reap everything you sew

[Nicki Minaj]
You piece of shit... you broke me down
Thought you said you... would hold me down
But I can see it in your eyes, that you're blinded by the flashing lights
And youse a stupid motherfucker for lettin this thing, pass you by, I...

[Chorus]</pre>
