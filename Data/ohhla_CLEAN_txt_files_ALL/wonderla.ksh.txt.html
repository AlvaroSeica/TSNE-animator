Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I was a just a young kid
With time to waste
Living out of my car
Those were the days

We were all the wild ones
The wasted youth
Other than a dream
Had nothing to lose

Ain't it funny how time flies?
Fades into gold
Now I wanna do a drive-by
But I can't find the road

Back to wonderland
Where it all began
Everything was so simple then
Living life like our last weekend
Wish I could find my way
Back to wonderland

Carrie's in the valley
She's got a kid
Julie's still a waitress
Livin' on tips

Sometimes we get together
And shoot the shit
But it's not the same now
No, nothin' is

Feels like it was a movie
That plays in my mind
Shadows of a past life
Wish I could rewind

Back to wonderland
Where it all began
Everything was so simple then
Living life like our last weekend
Wish I could find my way
Back to wonderland

Didn't have a clue
What we were doing
Or where we would end up
Living off of nickels
And dimes and our
Young reckless love

We didn't ever think
That time would
Ever come to an end
Now if I could
You know I'd run

Back to wonderland
Where it all began
Everything was so simple then
Living life like our last weekend
Wish I could find my way
Back to wonderland</pre>
