Verse One: The Reepz

C'mon baby baby, baby, baby
Make you happy, so high, so fly gravy
Hang with my crew RNF on the daily
Love look at that ass, shake like jelly
Watch what you say cause the shit might ricochet
No diggiday, drink smack down in the ?camare?
with my familay, tape deck blastin
Listenin to ?Fraz? braggin about riches
Claimin that they bashful, just to get vicious with
updated fashion and fucked up bitches but
I'm not worried, no need to hurry
Slow down shorty, you're headed for disaster
Woulda told ya c'mon, but drove right past ya
Got work to do so I can blow like NASA
Down with the G's now it's time for the laughter
and still give praise to my crew like a pastor

C'mon                           "c'mon baby baby" 
For everybody                   "baby c'mon", "c'mon baby baby"
who's in the house right now    "baby c'mon", "c'mon baby baby"
Let me hear you say             "baby c'mon", "c'mon baby baby"
Baby, baby, baby, c'mon         "baby c'mon", "c'mon baby baby"
For everybody                   "baby c'mon", "c'mon baby baby"
who's in the house right now    "baby c'mon", "c'mon baby baby"
Let me hear you say             "baby c'mon", "c'mon baby baby"
Baby, baby, baby, c'mon         "baby c'mon"

Verse Two: The Reepz

Porno disco is the way my click go
Got the camcorder, just thought I'd let you know
Must obey orders when this real nigga flow
Throw yo' hands high if you'd like to c'mon
The more cream, you know The Theme, we gets down like
puff a pound like, hit the cat you and your friends fuck around like
rockin til the cops come knockin, what that sound like
No romance, no finance unless you
turn that ass in the doo-doo brown stance
Tell your man to ease up, he ain't got a chance in this
Creep up, I tag that ass like a vandalist
Death kiss from The Reepz, dismissed

"c'mon baby baby", "baby c'mon" (8X) [Reepz also]

everybody
who's in the house right now
Let me hear you say
OOOOAHHH!  OOOOAHHH!
(repeat 2X)

Verse Three: The Reepz

?Seva?, and The Reepz on the set
Smoked out, lookin for hoes to sex
We was, twenty deep up in ?
We don't, spend a dime but we get rowdy
Seven, six three it's a Bronx affair
All I, see is thugs and fat ass everywhere
As I, play the background, in the dark bouncers
not around I commence to spark
You get, no creed for your G-string
Understand it's a R-double-E-P thing
That's my, click crew, niggaz stay worthy
Keep my shit tight, keep my style dirty
Reepz all we do is hit freaks with game
Hit em, in they guts send em home on the train
Real, nigga flow Reep-rezent on and on
Get bent til dawn, baby c'mon

"c'mon baby baby", "baby c'mon" (4x)
For everybody                   "baby c'mon", "c'mon baby baby"
who's in the house right now    "baby c'mon", "c'mon baby baby"
Let me hear you say             "baby c'mon", "c'mon baby baby"
OOOOAHHH!  OOOOAHHH!            "baby c'mon", "c'mon baby baby"
