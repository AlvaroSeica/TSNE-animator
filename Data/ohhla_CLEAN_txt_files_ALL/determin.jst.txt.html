[Chorus: King Just]
Must be the music, that's turning me on, must be the music
Must be the music, Mr. Choke Armstrong, must be the music
Must be the music, how can I go on, must be the music
Must be the music, I know you'll flow on, on

[King Just]
Love is love, love, especially for a thug
I love my seed and my weed, it was my first drug
I love, guns when I got 'em, I love guns when I shot 'em
I even love the fact that these bitch niggas pack
Watching for every move I make, love getting paid
Love to still fuck Ricki by the Lake
Take until we get, New York, New York
Love the Knicks, Yanks and Jets, Giants, Rangers and Mets
Scantex projects, I love to ask about the logic
Who loves making beats on foreign objects
My conscience is loved by every one, uzi weigh a ton
Ain't stressing 'em, moving up like the Jeffersons

[Chorus]

[King Just]
As soon as I spit it, I give it, I already done did it
You bitch ass niggas won't admit it
A hundred and ten percent with it, man I'm still living it
While you fucking dream about the shit
If rap had an old folks home, you'd be in it
Don't fucking quit your day job, dog, stick to spinning
Who You signed KJ, that's a given
Go platinum bound in Mars, that's the mission
KJ's the champion, you ain't listen?
On the block, the top shotta, boy, who wan' diss 'em?
I'm like Ted DiBi', on the precent, pissing
If you can't take the heat, stay out of bum's kitchen
I see you be giving, in the plots, we be mixing
Pass the glock, start hitting, when the clocks start ticking
I'm the key in the ignition, Watergate Scandal mixing
How you gon' have a steak, if you ain't got all the fixings, what?

[Chorus]

[Hook 2X: King Just]
Who You be bumping til the, daylight, in Park Hill
KJ be smoking all through the night, yes I will</pre>
