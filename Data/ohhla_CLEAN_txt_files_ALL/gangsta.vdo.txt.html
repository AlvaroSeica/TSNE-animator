[Verse One: Vado] (Sample from "Gangsters Anthem" by Terror Fabulous)
(Show mi) Where them bricks, peas and that cake at
These streets you ain't safe at where that safe at? 
Uh! That cash rout quick to lash out just straight blast
Back out with that strap out no face mask 
(Gangsta) Slash d boy, built to hustle that d boy
Fuck a tussle what's he for I'm in the cut and bubble like kilo
Saw the struggle I'm p noid p eighty now a ap or
Them ain't allowed without street noise
New Barry White with no deep voice
(*HUH!) Spit facts, lost the dice and threw head cracks
Came back in that dread hat with two pistols out where that spread at?
Talkin niggas I'm fed at, always talkative where them feds at
Walk in the crib where you fed at, see you eatin good where that bread at?
For life though, cuban link vs ice glow
Hit the strip with that white flow and get rid of weight like lipo
You can spit but I'm nice yo, got weight mo' I need eight mo'
Tell me shit that I ain't know like women lettin I ain't go

[Chorus: Sample from "Gangsters Anthem" by Terror Fabulous]

[Verse Three: Ace Hood] (Sample from "Gangsters Anthem" by Terror Fabulous)
Yeah! two young niggas in an unmarked car seat back so far with a mac on guard
Masked up pretty in an all black skully in a gun known fully pullin up in yo' yard
Kick-Kick-Kickin in the door wavin in the fo' fo' choke hold yo' hoe to the safe we go
Dead down here down here with yo' folks, show me where the money that green gwop dough
(Gangsta) 'Fore I leave yo' brains on the bedroom flo' clap clap shoot shoot nigga that's free throw
Don't like free poles when a nigga reload won't miss Kobe with his black two fo's
Fast! Put the money in the duff bag, load it up, in and out just relax
Gnagstas niggas don't make us send them haitians meet yo' maker
LORD! (Show mi) Still pray for you pussy niggas
Walk around like I'm Godzilla, best friends with some cold killers
Hold the chopper like a newborn, guess who was that babysitter?
Wanted to probably come get it then, black born than chinchilla
Me boy! Me boy! play with mine you get destroyed
Gettin head while I count money HUH! Rozay voice
