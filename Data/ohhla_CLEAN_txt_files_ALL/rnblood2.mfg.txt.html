I'm possessed by Huey P. Newton
Feds stress me out, then we're shootin
Keep goin, we'll start it my elders
Take best shot, brain made of kevlar
Got crown back, wear it like Babar
MF Grimm is Superstar Jet Jaguar
My heroes kill cowboys
Go in trance and do rain dance
Beats drummin, summon ancestors
Help conquer all aggressors
Die for people is a pleasure
Satisfaction is beyond measure
Drop jewels so babies can treasure
Drop fools who rely on weak methods
Pimp they own, fuck what you stand for
Bling bling, anything you fall for
Cha ching, for the money, you sell out
Misleading the youth, get the hell out
They give you their money, you buy diamonds
You selfish bastard, I hope you die then
You need to feed your people
Born dead from American hunger
Kill more cowboys I wonder
Go in trance and do rain dance

[1st chorus]
For fallen comrades (Make it rain blood)
For the brothers on lockdown (Make it rain blood)
For the sisters that hold it down (Make it rain blood)
Show we don't fuck around (Make it rain blood)
Die like a warrior (Make it rain blood)
Uplift the people (Make it rain blood)
The struggle continues (Make it rain blood)
Rain blood
Rain blood
Rain blood
Rain!

Jet Jag stay at war, I hear gunshots
Robot override computer
Capable of stopping riots, but able to insight riots
Foresight be on fourth dimension
Microphone transform all tension
My heroes kill cowboys I mention
Go in trance and do rain dance
We howl at moon in broad daylight
Wolves lost they mind, we don't live right
No love, we kill off each other
We need to love each other
We are disappearing my brothers
Through drugs and these guns, murder
Through pistols and prison, I'm awaken
Go in trance and do rain dance

[2nd chorus]
At those who oppress us (Make it rain blood)
We of the people (Make it rain blood)
Three fifths a man, what? (Make it rain blood)
Fuck being a slave (Make it rain blood)
Rather be in my grave (Make it rain blood)
Die like a warrior (Make it rain blood)
Bust shots at the clouds (Make it rain blood)
Rain blood
Rain blood
Rain blood
Rain!

Expose those flows who's really fakers
And dance on they ass cause I'm a rainmaker
Jet Jaguar, spins cause whirlwinds
Godzilla, kicking down buildings
Monsters on the Island are illin
Some clone us, end up like Gilligan
Take them all to war, I'm willing
MF is gone, peace to Megalon

[Repeat 1st chorus]</pre>
