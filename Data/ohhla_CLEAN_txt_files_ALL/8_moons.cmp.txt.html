[Chorus: repeat 2X]
As I'm racing forward through time
Deja Vu clouds my mind
There's no pause or rewind
Whats behind is behind 

[Suede]
Swift drifting in memory you remember me
Days of electric melody
Glamourous galaxies where ??? all swimming so heavily
It feel like eight moons ago, but three is what you telling me
There's something that you should know
First sip this Rangelico
OK I was trying boo, lusting, thats how I lost your trusting
This seat was my pleasure be our measure we dreamt forever
I never meant to hurt you break you betray you desert you
Guess I was young....Guess I was dumb

[Chorus]

[Suede]
At the central park we was blood brothers
Known on Valentine as the young lovers
Switching, hitting different ones before rubbers
You chose the coke route smoke route dope route
I chose the mic life hype life night life
On separate paths, we still clash on the Ave
And spilling saying the glass
And blinding our mats with hash
Still in my dreams I can see you so clear
Wake up out of my puzzle haze I cant believe you ain't here
I miss you

[Chorus]

[Suede]
Is there something cosmic 
In how we orbit and circle the wild orchid
From catching the kids to hickies to quickies
We make me walking
There's no beginning or ending its just how we'll absorb it
You ??? and ending touch ??? when you'll be rewarded
Time keeps running like my visions a wonder
Thats feeding my hunger thats leading to the music thats under
Thats leading me higher, igniting my fire 
Till I touch the seventh plane of change

[Chorus]</pre>
