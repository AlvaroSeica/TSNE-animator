[Chorus: sample of "Light of the Morning" by Band of Skulls] + (Melanie) + {Royce}
"You gotta go, you-you gotta go"
"You-you gotta go, you gotta go" (That-a-way)
"You gotta go, you-you gotta go"
"You-you gotta go, you"
"But-but I wanna see you in the, see you in the"
"See you in the" (Walkin)
"See you in the, see you in the"
"See you in the" (Walk of) {Shame}

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Six in the morning don't even know yo' name
Even though I'm glad that you came - I'm sorry but {"you gotta go"}
Instead of tryin to parlay
Why don't you make like heaven's havin a soir√©e - the party's up {"gotta go"}
No disrespect to you, I just met you-you
Special boo but you {"got-got-got-got-gotta go"}
And even though I feel you fly
My incidental bill's too high - sorry you {"gotta go"}
Here put my number in your phone so we can talk again
That walk to the lobby you got, we call that the +Walk of Shame+ {"gotta go"}
I don't know what room Joey's in, or where's your friend
I don't know your friend, no offense, but
Goodbye! Mwah!

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
It all started when she stuck out her rear
Top bunk of the tour bus she gettin dug out up here, hey
{"You gotta go"} It felt like we coulda hung out a year
But I was thinkin with my dick now bitch get the fuck outta here, AY
{"Gotta go"} I'm sorry that I did your girl reckless
I fed her a squirrel breakfast, she left with a pearl necklace
{"Got-got-got-got-gotta go"} That big ol' ass had to be felt on
or else it's just a waste/waist like the space I put my belt on
She {"gotta go"} huh, now tell me what the hell's wrong?
+Fed+ with your +Ex+, you get sex then get mailed home {"gotta go"}
Thugnificent tell them go that-a-way
Then I send that bitch a smiley face, bitches love a smiley face!

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Cab on speed-dial, I ain't with devotion
Ain't buyin what you sellin, nah I ain't drinkin the potion
{"You gotta go"} Plan like e'rything's slow motion
But it's "sweet Baby Jesus" when the +Frank's+ in her +Ocean+
{"Gotta go"} I don't know magic tricks, but you'll see plenty soon
Amazin I'll get one night stand in this empty room {"got-got-got-got-gotta go"}
She got gored, bein annoyed she ain't get breakfast
I tell her roleplay and be a voyeur with the exit {"gotta go"}
Nah, you don't get a key to the crib
You can be my wife for an hour and get me in your rib
But then you {"gotta go"} and this party ain't unusual
She's sorry she came, I'm sorry it's not mutual

[Chorus]

[Joell Ortiz]
Yeah, last night was fun
But that look like the sun, so yeah last night is done
And um {"you gotta go"} I know, I'm sad too
Don't forget your earrings, oh these ain't yours? My bad, but here's your bag boo
You {"gotta go"} your hair look fine, I swear, your hair look fine
Plus nobody care, you a dime, but look at the time
Girl you {"got-got-got-got-gotta go"} I got shit to do
But next time I'm in town you got my word I'ma get wit'chu
Now where the fuck's this missin shoe? You {"gotta go"}
When I go on tour I find me a hoe for sure
with open jaws and cute knees that both go on floors {"gotta go"}
Ginas and Pams, I ain't tryin to be cold
But, in the words of Martin, you ain't gotta go home but

[Chorus]</pre>
