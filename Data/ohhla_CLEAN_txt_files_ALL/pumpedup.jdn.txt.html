Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Spit if I can't jog in here
And I spit if I knock the street yo
Tic Toc can't stop my feet
He a real G rock the beat uh
Had a fun time last night
Got girls here, that's right
We could chill if you act right
Fell asleep on my hot pipe
Got school but we coolin' aye
Let the cool kids do this uh
And our flows be too sick uh
So cool you drowlin' yup
Yup yup, I does it
This my city right here, I run it
Ask me of that, quick quick pop shove it
Girls be sayin' that I'm runnin' no matter what it's cuz

[Chorus]
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me

Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me

[Verse 2]
Wanna know what a slide mean?
Find a place with the most skateboards, scraped concrete
All my G's behind me
We ain't afraid of none of the zombies
More peace than Gandhi
Up all night, never seen if you can call me a zombie
Yak, bringin' it way back
Before I get to cruise with my dad playin' trucks and Maybach
Now I'm the king of the misfits
So I'm a G's most king of the kickflips
And it must be the raps I spit
To get invited to these parties with all these hot actresses
Yo I ain't even mad of this
But I'll probly get some crap for this
From parents and my sis and the people I be actin' with
But it's cool, I'mma act and trip cuz

[Chorus]
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me

Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me

[Verse 3]
People say âbe safeâ and I hate that
So I go to skate live with no pads
Ha ha, rebel
Yea, we skate hard, better get up on the level
If you can't then it's no problem
If you want daxon we got him
Lookin' up like there's no bottom
Spittin' flows hotter than lava
New York means we're hover
Then go to Nobel with shotgun
These girls, they thinkin' I'm older
Then break it to âem and shock âem
Told you I was the realest,
swag bustin' through ceilings
And oh told me they'd kill us
So what did I do? I kill it cuz

[Chorus]
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me

Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me

[Chorus]
Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me

Everybody want kicks like me
Everybody want chicks like me
Everybody want flicks like me
Everybody tryna get like me</pre>
