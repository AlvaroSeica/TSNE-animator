Can you be my doctor? Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down? So I can lick you up
Make you give it up, give it up, 'til you say my name
Like a jersey, jersey, shuttin down the game
Be my head coach, so you can put me in
And never take me out, 'til you can taste the win
Do it again and again 'til you say my name
And by the way - I'm so glad that you came
Tell me baby are you, wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
I'm gonna get you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
Tell tell me baby are you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
I just wanna get you wet wet wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
Drip, drip, drip drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip (well she well she leakin)
Drip, drip, drip drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip (well she well she leakin)

(It's the, it's the, it's the Cataracs)

[Snoop Dogg]
She's hot on a rainy day, don't drown
Call me up, I can save you now
Lick your feet and kiss your mouth
Swisher sweet, I gut you out
There's only one way we can stop the drought
Come with me and take a trip down south
I can tell she's thirsty
I'm in the hole like a birdie
What you wanna do tonight it's still early
Wanna get some food tonight she's lost 30
I'm in between yo' lips, like a cigarette
She wanna quit, but she wanna make it make it
Make it wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
I'm wanna get you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
Tell tell me baby are you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
I just wanna get you wet wet wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
Drip, drip, drip drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip (well she well she leakin)
Drip, drip, drip drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip (well she well she leakin)

(It's the, it's the, it's the Cataracs)

[Snoop Dogg]
Can you, can you get me up? Like I'm late for the first class
So I can give it to you rough like a first draft
Fold you like a paper plane, you know 'bout that paper babe
But fuck them dollar bills, girl make it rain
Holiday Inn, come amd meet me on the 8th floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for them maids though
And I, and I-I I apologize
But when I slip inside I turn girls into Slip-N-Slides
It's a flood in your heart love
Girl let me pop up in your hot tub, hey!
Every night every day sippin on a different drink
Different chicks different days, I do it different ways
Where you goin, what'cha say?
I want her river flowin, to another lake
Another ocean another ocean, on the beach on the beach
I'm bout to take a swim let let me dip my feet
and get wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
I'm wanna get you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
Tell tell me baby are you wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
I just wanna get you wet wet wet (wet, wet, wet, wet, wet..)
Drip, drip, drip drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip (well she well she leakin)
Drip, drip, drip drip for me mami
Can you drip, drip, drip (well she well she leakin)</pre>
