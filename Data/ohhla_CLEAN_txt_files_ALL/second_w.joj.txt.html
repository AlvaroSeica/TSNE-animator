[Intro: JoJo Pellegrino talking]

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Yo Hitman For Hire, classy attire
They told me low key was wiser, but daddy, I can't help these flashy desires
Mr. Pellegrino, the fans see the flyest
The fishes still sleep, the dish is so deep they can't see the tires
Feel me, this is rap at it's best, I used to rap on the bench and ?rag at the jets?
?With twenty head trees backwords at best?
Now it's rapping for checks, hennessey bottles, duffle bags and the cess
Everynight passing is sex, me and my piece take the street route
Up in the clubs, we ?deexed out?, like this what we bout
Knock your teeth out, now spit your beef out
Daily, I hit the studio with shit on my chest
Blow the weed out, spit the rough mix and have it leak out
(New JoJo) I'm Blanco, rock jewels, I'm getting paper, call me Joey ?Fazzoo?
Fools, this games full of dudes with careless flows
Fool, the media says high, but they sales is low
Me, I keep a buzz in the street, Every record they keep
Baby blues is deep, imagine the sales in my first week (tell em son)
I'm talking top of the world, purschase a gown for my mom and my girl
Gather the fam and pop till we hurl

[Chours: June Luva (JoJo Pellegrino)]
Yo, you can't stop us from meeting
I'm hitting the block hard this weekend
Seven days dropping and breathing
We put it down for what we stand for daddy (stand up)
We can take it to the dance floor daddy (hands up)
Man I told ya'll I'm a broad street killer
Ducking and dodging the cops, with twelve twelves stashed in my socks
We put it down for what we stand for daddy (hands up)
We can take it to the dance floor daddy (hands up)

[JoJo Pellegrino]
This is life behind music
Every kick, every snare tells a tales of a soul slaughtered to it
What you hear is blood, sweat and tears, I've been through it
Leaving the book get loose when I push the pen to it
Nobody loves me like me, yeah I'm my own best friend
Don't need no company, I move by my lonesome
Every now and then I'm crying to Jesus
If it ain't one of my peoples from a bullet, one of my family members dies from diseases
But life goes on, I hop on stage, beats go on, cameras roll on
The very second the light goes on
Now it's up close and personal, putting it down for the borough
Where thye cutch toast to murder you, Thugs post observing you
Chicks itch to get their hands on what's in Jo's boxers
Easy ma, got a wife that be smelling my own boxers
Really, I don't chase these bunnies, I'm trying to make this money
You jealous bastards can't take ish from me
Keep it moving I got this (got this), watch this (watch this)
I'ma drop hits and get rich where your pops shits (peep it)
I'm talking top of the world, purschase a gown for my mom and my girl
Gather the fam and pop till we hurl, let's rock

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
