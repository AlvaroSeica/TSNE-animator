[Intro: Ca$his]
Uh, yeah, Blocc Boy on the beat
It's Ca$his, spend some real shit
It's for my, it's for my seeds, nigga
It's still Shady though, hah

[Ca$his]
Sit back right, all night spot post
Do the same thang, killin off black folks
Selling on the side, string save a mean mo'
To anything I own, rocks, crack, E and smoke
Got the picture of the seven little reasons
that keep, any nigga disrespectin me breathin
Still I be high, every time I see them
My babies, my angels, and they are my freedom
I know I'm on the grind, lately I ain't comin home
They keep you in my life, I never leave your mom alone
You know I'm whylin out, strayin strapped, ride or dyin
You hear the stories 'bout your daddy floatin 'round town?
But you call me up like, "Daddy I been findin out
that you caught Rico slippin, beat him up and stomped him out"
So when you go to school, you wanna do it too?
You just like me, how can I be mad at you?

[Chorus: Ca$his]
You ain't had to live like I did
And still you are just like me (you are just like me)
Hell I even did a bid and came back to see
You are just like me (you are just like me)
The only reason I ain't kill myself
Is for fear you'll be just like be (you'll be just like me)
You got the demons that's within myself
Now I see, you are just like me (you are just like me)

[Ca$his]
Standin on the block, tryin to make my money clock
Servin situations, my nuts about a cock
I wanna stop but, y'all gotta have a lot
Even if it means sacrificin the life of your pops
I'm the breadwinner, I don't fear nann nigga
I don't trust nobody, I'm a man - liquor
runnin through my veins, you runnin through my brain
I start to see your heart, we feel each other's pain
I talk to all of y'all when I say I love you mayne
One day we'll ball and I'll never have to leave again
Until that day comes, shorty be a G
I ride with y'all everywhere cause y'all are part of me
Here go my hugs and kisses, never give you up for bitches
Promise to give you riches, all of my lil' niggaz
Here go my hugs and kisses, never give you up for bitches
Promise to give you riches, all of my lil' niggaz (lil' niggaz)

[Chorus]

[Ca$his]
Look how they talkin shit, twice a year I drop a ki' (so what)
I bet nobody ever love 'em like they daddy did
I teach 'em young, don't be rollin on no scary shit
Long as you love each other, you'll be very rich
Everybody question how I be affordin this
I make my money off of dicks and spend it on my kids
I'm sendin messages in bottles of imagination
so they can feel my presence, though they at home just waitin
My soldiers still in trainin, throwin up forks like they bangin
Know how to bogart, and never trust a stranger
They the ones I look to whenever I'm in danger
We walkin holdin hands, interlockin trigger fingers
This is my record to my kids, I'm a banger
and a father so my conversation must remain gangsta
This is my record to my kids, I'm a banger
and a father so my conversation must remain gangsta

[Chorus]

[Outro: Ca$his]
Yeah, it don't get much realer than that
Shady, Ca$his, uhh
Nigga, be a man, take care of yours
That don't make you no less gangsta
My nigga not take care of his
I take care of mine homie
I'ma give a individual shoutout to 'em
Miana, Jasmine, Ramani, Rashanti
Lil' Mone, and Rah Monique, Tavian
They are just like me {*echoes*}</pre>
