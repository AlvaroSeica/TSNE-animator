Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm the black sheep of the family
Graffiti up on the alley
An ambulance passin'
Another tragedy happened in cali
All I wanted was a role model
My father worked hard
So tell me who the fuck was I suppose to follow?
It's hard to swallow
My stomach's hollow
Knowing I only had top ramen to eat tomorrow
I had no problem drug dealing
I get mad
When I think of all the bullshit that I was feeling
I believe my father really broke a happy home
Left us stranded in the dark
For a fucking whore
I prayed to god it wouldn't happen
But I was ignored
If it ain't my family
What the fuck I'm living for?
No looking forward
No looking back
No hesitation
When I put my hands on that strap
My music is the pain in my mother's eyes
People struggling in the ghetto
Something never televised

[Chorus]
People struggling in the ghetto
Something never televised
Killuminati won't even save you
From all the struggle I survive
One shot, two - three - four
Can you feel the vibe?
This is for my mother's pain
And everything she sacrificed

[Verse 2]
I'm still mad at my brother's chick
I can't believe she snitched on 'em
God damn you on some other shit
I learned my lesson
Never trust a bitch
I'm thinking karma's a mutherfucker
While staring at my rubber grip
My close homies on the run again
My phone's tapped
I think I'm being followed by these undercover pigs
I think they wanna set me up
On some sucker shit
Snitching will never happen
Forever be the opposite
Got my enemies saying
That muthafucker's sick
L.a. - chi-town even brooklyn
We got something in common
If you wonderin'
Hustle hard
Til the day you pay your mother's rent
Ain't that the real reason why we started hustlin'?
Besides the cars &amp; the fame
And trying to fuck a bitch
My music is the pain in my mother's eyes
Stranded in the ghetto
Is something that's never televised

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My president is talkin' bout some bullshit again
They keep taking education money from the kids
I never seen 'em once ever speak about the homeless
Or ever talk about the gang related
Feeling hopeless
Incase you didn't notice
The youngest to the oldest
Homies never realize
Til that eviction notice
It's time for us to grow up
The real world afraid of us
That's why they never show love
You know what they label us
Wish I could just ignore the world
With a ounce of weed
And tell the people in the ghetto
They can count on me
Now dim the muthafucking lights
Put me in front of a crowd
Who applauds when I mention christ
My music is the pain in my mother's eyes
Stranded in the ghetto
Is something that's never televised

[Chorus]</pre>
