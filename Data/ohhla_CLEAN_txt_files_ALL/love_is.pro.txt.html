[Intro: Prodigal Sunn]
A portrait of love
Yeah, I'm feeling good tonight, baby
I'm feeling good tonight
We looking good tonight, we feeling good tonight
Yo, bartender, what up, baby?
Let me get three bottles of that fresh chilly white wine, baby
8 glasses, keep it coming, uh-huh, I'm feeling good tonight

[Prodigal Sunn]
Pardon me miss, you remind me of my favorite dish
Butter soft complexion, shining like some diamonds that gliss
And in my mind, I'm thinking I can't miss
Once in a lifetime, I get the chance like this
Pressure as the moment, bright as the day of atoinment
Baby resist, y'all had a mind open, while we was wine floatin'
Conversation unique, spectacular speech for
Nacural piece, complete from head to feet
Damn, smiles and laughters, as I, test through her thousand chapters
I made it clear to the ear, what I'm really after
Honesty in a woman, it makes me feel good
Loyalty be that bond, rarely understood
See I'm about, building a team, fulfilling your dreams
You sweet like the cream in between
So understand boo, I do the very best I can
Sincerely truly yours, Sunzini, one hell of a man, you

[Chorus 2X: Aleksei, Prodigal Sunn]
Love is love, love is love
From the heavens up above
Two people together, hand in glove
Symbolizes love (this is a portrait of love)

[Prodigal Sunn]
Exotic moonshine, invincible beauty, one of a kind
Features rare, like the deepest Cleopatra design
I had her in minds, plans to give her blessings in time
Life is genuine, explaining why I don't eat swine
She said listen, I'm vegetarian, I don't eat chicken
Plus I'm all about my business, with, political
And rap type, perfection, all she wanted was direction
Connection, she called me, her love weapon, that's when my
Heart still content, loving the smell of a scent
Hazel nut eyes, original like them Indian tents
And when she spoke, she spoke with words of innocence
I said to pay rent, I do it for the ladies and gents
Keep a 380 ready for any shady events
Hoody thing won't you be mine, let's make time
Let me elevate your mind, illuminate your shine

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
