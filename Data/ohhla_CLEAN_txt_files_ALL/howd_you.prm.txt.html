Song:   How'd You Get So Fresh
Typed by: PremRock 

How'd you get so fresh?
well my intellect been in effect
since first breath
And ever since the day I was taking my first step 
1 foot learned to follow the next, it's progress.
From Bangladesh to Bangor, Maine
Prem bang the fresh over Slang exchange
A Diggy Dang dang to the bang out sound thats all flames
Long range while we shout out loud "thats all day!"
Next spot to set it
Flex the tight style
The Lexicons edited, 
Flow is lights out
Night owl with scripts, no White Owl to twist
Because i'd rather blaze tracks
With that active spit
The reactant, the chemical reactivist
Reenacting the past of the passionate
Cause we intact while the masses react to this
Stereo match the pitch, make em clap to this

Chorus (2X)

Mic Check How'd you get so fresh?
Well every move I made I made it with progress
Mic Check How'd. You get so fresh?
Well I , Well I always gave it my best
Mic Check 

How I learned to get down It was a process
Soon as I came out the womb, the room was like "AWWW YESSS!"
No need for alarm like Del's record
No firearms, no jail records
7-1-85 that was the date of my birth
The doctor looked at me and said "son wait its gets worse"
I said Doc I'm prepared, trust me I'm aware..
But if you excuse me Im a make my way to that nurse
How I learned to get down was on some other shit
On some "Mother should I trust the government?"
She said "son listen here you can form own beliefs
But church is Sunday be there or on punishment."
Alright Ma, I'm memorizing my psalms
Inside i'm a pipe bomb with red light on
So i studied my raps strapped in with lights off
in a cavernous den, a ravenous pen
to write on---on

Chorus (2X)

How'd you get so nice
Well I looked to the heavens and I took his advice
Everything in life is worth looking at twice
So double check my seat before booking my flight
Knowing deep down inside that I'm already fly
But stay grounded i've confounded the worldwide
Every caption Id hit
adapt to the conflict
Rapid reponse shit
attack with the bomb-ness
The Au-thentic cause you cant augment the raw statements
With every audition I'm acing
Every class placed in, advanced placement
But I only attended so I could placate them
Like "Uh"
With them headphones blasting
With that hypnotic head nod shit that close caption
That soul sonic, roll up the chronic, that romantic
Bumping my speakers while I'm
tweaking the whole canvas
