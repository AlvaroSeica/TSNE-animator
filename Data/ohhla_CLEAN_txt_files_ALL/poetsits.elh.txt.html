a poet sits on a bench and he writes his poem
(captain of the poets)

[v1]
watch me grab my patterns of thought
in permanent ink on slabs of bark
a train riding through the middle of your mind
planted down in my spinal tappin your body
mappin with vinyl life
(turntables) illuminate
(the finer things) spinnin underground casin
things will never just be the same old thing
forever revolutionizing the scene, a poet
you know it, when I flow it get your action on appeal
(like a top quarterback)
attend your line with a hard ass mind and a hype that's rhyme
feel me, writing the book of my life
with a bypass surgical heart implant
where the art is kept
swept, get, past the front door
where the mass minister, sinister
never that priest, east to west we blast and meet ya
with hands to me to expand the legacy
that will hype and chill where the gates at
It's amazing to elevate, allocate, final truncate
with the feature to play back

[v2]
my fate chose to follow me this far
a shadow came with every step as life revealed the dark
a guardian, a hell's angel, tested my fate
and they be, unsure of every move that I would make
and I ignore, sometimes listen
on every mission we explore, the outs and ins
just like sailors on the shore
a poet riding the wave of metaphors
stop to dock by the bay and write an editorial
life wasn't easy, tribe unique we are soul survivors
I done seen things, eyes of a deep sea diver
mister mystery missin a word to describe, i'm
sittin patiently waitin for earth to enlighten my
my destiny inspired every quote
it met me at this crossroad just tryin to let me know
It's more to grow
mean what I said in chan eleven flow
and always check for signals, internet has the info

(captain of the poets)

[v3]
maybe the legacy i-n check
will be the impression I leave on the people who listen to music I make
take it or leave it believe it or not
got my man on the side to prove this point
forges strong in the family tree
roots are stronger than enemy's hate
so relate to me if you can't
pledge your thoughts in a garden with freedom of speech
to each his own, metrinome
childrens grow to know the world
even home with the young mind
looking for answers in the truth
my music will guide you through time
used to be that kid on the bench in the park writin to figure out life
now I'm a man on the mic who's doin his mark, thinking of kids and a wife
It's important to me to know my days on earth mean something more
than a couple songs I made that played in basement stereos galore
aerial views of crews I knew and memory bank that hourglass
thinking of lessons learned as tables turned another hour pass
legacy's left while pen strokes enlightenment from a future class
so many young and talented broke livin l.a. life with a bus pass
travelling to the open mic spots anywhere they can bust at

(captain of the poets)

[v4]
It's hard to keep the peace without dealing with the war
It's hard to feel you've got it all when you can get more
but just think back, way back when when you had none
and wanted some, and we were hungry as they come
just dumb and young, and young and dumb and we had fun
in lemmard park, and harvard park and leffard park
specific start, was 84 I was only nine
been writin rhymes and in these times eligh
I see why people quit, they don't see the benefits
only in it to get rich, hit it big or forfeit
and off course is the politics
collegeship went on the back burner
didn't get a scholarship even though I was a fast learner
searchin for the undisputed truth
experience, I've had more data for the proof
and here he is just have again, back in the loot
buried in the books but he's weary of their roots

(captain of the poets, so listen)</pre>
