[John Legend]
Give me the green liiiiiiight 
Give me just one NIIIIIIIGHT...
I'm ready to go right now 
I'm ready to go right now

(LET'S GO!)

I'm ready to go right now 
I'm ready to go right now

[Verse 1ne: John Legend]
I see you move, I'm checking your smile
Workin your back like, it's goin out of style
Shake just a little bit faster
Shake just a little now girl
Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
Got an obsession, of us gettin down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission soooo...

[Chorus]
Give me the green liiiiiiight 
Give me just one NIIIIIIIGHT...
I'm ready to go right now 
I'm ready to go right now
We can go all niiiiiight
Give me the green LIIIIIIIGHT...
I'm ready to go right now 
I'm ready to go right now

[Interlude: André 3000] (John Legend)
One, two, three - green light
Well, if it's what it seems like
They way you're movin baby let's me know that's it's gon' be right
I'mmmm - (I'm ready to go right now) Ah, ah
I'mmmm - (I'm ready to go right now)
A-one, two, three - red light
I wanna see what your bed's like
But if I be your buddy
Get you studied, is yo' head right?
I'mmmm - (I'm ready to go right now) Ah, ah
I'mmmm - (I'm ready to go right now)

[Verse 2wo: John Legend]
Do I have a girlfriend? Well, technically no (NO!)
If you be my girlfriend, then I'll make it so
You'll be my only true lover
No competition, no other (no other)
Baby, it's just, the thrill of the chase
I've got a feeling, I'm winnin this race
Baby, I'm in much CLO-ser
I just need permission so..

[Chorus + interlude]

[André 3000 - Rap Verse]
So I went hard like Madusa starin at me
I told her, "Let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory"
She said, "What kind of girl do you think that I are?
The kind that you meet in a bar?
You think you can get whatever you want 'cause you some kind of star"
No, I'm a comet; I, just want you woman
Hey, if I were you then it would be me that I'd go home with
Three, the one and only, one thang you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl, "Ooh, he can get it" - admit it
You did it! Let's hop a cab, and split it
I'm kiddin! We both goin to where you livin!
Eh-HAH!! I got you gigglin like a piglet - oh, that's the ticket?
I hope you more like, Anita Baker, than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady, so let me quit it
I'm just stylefreein, freestylin which I seldom do
This is what I'm tellin you, to the bed I'm nailin you
Like I've been in jail for two, years and then they let me loose
Ehahahahaha!

[Chorus]

[Andre overlaps]
You got you one, Legend!
Sometimes you gotta step from behind that piano!
And let 'em know what's going on..
Even Stevie Wonder got down sometimes..Hahaha!
I'm ready to go! My man Nate can't wait
Participate..
