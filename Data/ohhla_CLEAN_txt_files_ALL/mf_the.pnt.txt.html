[Knightowl (Talkin)]
Hollow Point's back
Comin at em
That's right

[Mr. Lil One]
Now won't you come and haunt
Take my from the world
What about my wife and
And my little baby girl
Think I'm bein selvish
Better yet I am
I'm runnin like a coward
I should face it like man
I got this paranoyia
Fuck with me daily
I got this paranoyia
That the law gladly gave me
Got mixed emotions
Runnin through my dome
A wife and a kid
Can't say that I'm alone
Still there's some thing wrong
Some thing about the song
They way I hear the beat kick
Makes me wanna think
Sit and reminise
Drink more and fuckin think
Think about the bad times
Think about the good times
Think about my mother
And why the fuck I lost mine
I guess when your number's up
You're through
And then you see another side
That you never knew
But still you got to fight
Or other wise you're through

[Chrorus: Mr. Lil One]
When you're fuckin with The Little
Then you're fuckin with the best
I only think about me mothafuck the rest

When you're fuckin with The Little
Then you better where your vest
Or you'll get a fuckin hole
Stranded dead up in your chest

When you're fuckin with The Little
Then you're fuckin with the best
I only think about me mothafuck the rest

When you're fuckin with The Little
Then you better where your vest
When you're fuckin with The Little
Then you're fuckin your death

[Knightowl]
Mothafuckas talk alot
That why they gotta drop alot
The Knightowl gotta stalk alot
Fools I fuck em alot
They always gotta ride and hide
But I've been watchin every stride
Perfect situation for another homicide
Don't double cross me fool
You haven't lost me yet
I'm standin right behind you
With a shank to go inside
To rip your fuckin skin
As you feel when it goes in
I love commitin krimes
And Little loves commitin sin
Hollow Point's the dou
That'll take you mothafuckas
On a journey
It's bitches like you that belong in
On a gourney
You better keep your mouth closed
Or land up in a box
I'm the one that'll take your breath
You fucked around with death
So listen never try me
Complements of my krimey
Bullets do the dome
That'll take you right to the land of the unknown
I'm livin life un-holy
Some what like a parole
You best not give me shit or die
Fool if you don't know me

[Chorus 2: Knightowl]
When you're fuckin with The Knightowl
Then you're fuckin with the best
I only think about me mothafuck the rest

When you're fuckin with The Knightowl
Then you better where your vest
Or get a fuckin hole
Stranded dead up in your chest

When you're fuckin with The Knightowl
Then you're fuckin with the best
I only think about me mothafuck the rest

When you're fuckin with The Knightowl
Then you better where your vest
When you're fuckin with The Knightowl
Then you're fuckin your death

[Mr. Lil One]
Well now I'm 25 and glad to be alive
Livin with the sin that I got buried up inside
I met many people
And many of them were lethal
And let me guarentee you
In your life there'll be a sequel
We're born with 1 face
But always see another
These mothafuckas bull shit
And keep it under cover
Talk behind your back
And say they love you rap
And when you turn around
They say that mothafuckas wack
But I got the DL
On every single one of you
Better belive I'll be there
Standing right infront of you
None of you can see me
None of you can be me
Even get respect from the ghosts
And the demons

[Chorus: Mr. Lil One]</pre>
