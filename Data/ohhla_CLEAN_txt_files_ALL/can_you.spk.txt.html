[Cashius Green]
Aiyyo it's too much smoke but it's not enough liquor
She say it's easier to choke, but she get drunk quicker
I'm like "Yo, where you tryin to go? Sunny, you're pushin the snow
The beach or you freeze like 32 below"
For sho', lil' momma I got'chu
I know that I'm puttin too much weight on ya shoulda but I'll spot you
Caviar your meal, oiled automobile
Make you drip like a seal, who the fuck need a deal?
I do but I don't, I won't, but I will
Gimme Ferraris with a Barbie holdin the wheel
My girl thicker than buttons, peanut butter and muffins
Who's that? Sheboulat{?} and she ain't even Russian
Try to gimme pokerr face, all I seen was bluffin
Compliment her dress and, all I seen was blsuhin
She ain't even a model, stripper or a dancer
But she gimme C's, the best possible answer

[Chorus: Speak] + (Cashius Green)
I gotta a pocket full of dough and I'm real sippin slow
The way my night is headed, honey I don't even know
But I got the kind of 'dro that'll make you snap your head back
All up in her C's homeboy can you accept that?
Can you accept that? (nah I can't accept that)
Can she accept that? (Homey she won't accept that)
Can he accept that? (Nah he won't accept that)
Can we accept that? (Hell yeah we can accept that)

[Speak]
I could take you from the darker side to lead you to the light
Cause you never ask a tiger where he got his fuckin stripes
All black leggings, got your booty lookin right
Man you fiendin for a tune up, now let me help you clean yo' pipes
Yikes, stripes, chew me up like a bubblegum
So charismatic, but you way too troublesome
The known jet, so I'm prone to Joan Jett
Cause I never gave a damn about my bad reputation
Hi! Salutations, welcome to my pleasure dome
Where I can hear your heartbeat, like clicks up on a metronome
I gotta let you know, this is what I lust for
Mac facial, with a Swisher rappin, is my Rushmore
Plus tour got my whole click paper chasin
The blue collar life had my damn neck chaffin
Now they show me love, every time I go to function
You got a 9-5, I forever stay punched in
