Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
The rain is falling
And it's pouring down on me
I can't escape it, the stress has got the best of me
The strangest feelings
All this pain and agony
The rain is falling
And it's pouring down on me

Down on me, it's pouring down on me

[Verse 1]
Uh, I grip a rock for you, climb to the top for you
Well she couldn't find these heels I got for you
Stress cryin over a man, that's not for you
No matter what, yo friends gon say I'm not for you
Fuck we both know that they hatin though
It's all good, it's not them who I'm datin though
Always take up for them, I'm supersave a ho
My hand reach out to you like what you waitin fo?
As I write in my notepad, with a glass of pinot grigio as you roll grass
Like things happening so fast
Tryna drive in the rain, I hope you don't crash

[Chorus]
The rain is falling
And it's' pouring down on me
I can't escape it, the stress has got the best of me
The same, these feelings
All this pain and never me
The rain is falling
And it's' pouring down on me

[Hook]
All the suffering, the grimy things
That's came back with you
Too much weight on my shoulders is pinning me down
I just can't get you by the name
It's raining, it's pouring
It's raining, it's pouring
It's falling down me

[Verse 2]
Babe, have a seat as I hold the chair out
Relax, have a drink, tell me your whereabouts
Your past, who you slept with, I don't care about
If it's dirty get it washed, no need to air it out
Muah, I love you, I love you
Kisses on the forehead, after, I hug you
God as my witness, no one above you
I'm glad to be with this, we the perfect couple

[Chorus: x2]
The rain is falling
And it's' pouring down on me
I can't escape it, the stress has got the best of me
The strangest feelings
All this pain and agony
The rain is falling
And it's' pouring down on me

Down on me, it's pouring down on me</pre>
