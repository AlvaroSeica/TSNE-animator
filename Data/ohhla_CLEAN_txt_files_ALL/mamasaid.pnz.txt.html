[Psalmz]
Yeah
This is dedicated for those people we lost along the way
When things get hard, you just gotta keep on looking forward
Never look back
Everyone got somethin' to say
I guess I'd explain
Uh hun
Yo

[Verse 1: IzReal]
Born hampered
Just a disadvantaged kid
Whose dirty pampers
Hung like Angus did
She had the mattress
Juggled two languages
Plus my anger
Couldn't be tampered with
A young grown-up, by a loner, with no owner
Proud corners to close, caught fowl odors
Grew older, which grew vulgar, chip shoulders
No diploma, I stood home, writing these rhymes over
Dad spoke in a vintage
Broken English
He said, "Don't burn bridges you can't extinguish
By
Runnin' through districts with thieves and misfits
If the feet land in prison, don't believe a visit"
Mama prayed, "Lord Jesus, keep on cohesive
Make peace lead each that walk the streets sleepless
Help them reach peeps and dreams that deem reachless
Oh
Valley, they speech is like antique pieces
Son"

Chorus:
(Psalmz in background)
[Diamonique] Don't worry cause we gonna make it
[Psalmz]     Mama said
[Diamonique] Hold your head up, bend it
[Psalmz]     He told me
[Diamonique] I don't wanna see you cry no more
             No, no, no (Papa said)
             Everything's gonna be alright
             Keep strong, have faith
             Baby, don't lose sight (That's what they told me)

[Verse 2: Ark]
Mama warned me, she said, "When it rains, it pours"
But who's to blame for the pain that I came across
Me and my older brothers grown to hold so much grudges
Against the man who made us, but could never grow to love us
A little bastard
Pop left my ass in pampers
Sold the little cash that mom had, had to mastered
But now what last, the past is past us
Mama prayed to the past, said the ashes to ashes
Well, I learned what the streets could teach
Thought I never reach
My peek was always knee deep in beef
We grew from a root, the feeling, ruthless livin'
That driven, group of criminal, youths, not givin'
One fuck, I been stuck with so much to spare
Corrupted prayers and drunk off my cup that tears
Too much to bear, all I have's the love we shared
It's all for one, one for all like the Musketeers

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Psalmz]
Mama said, "They'll be days like this"
What mama said would've made me rich
What mama said
Was address the mess, what's left, the naked truth
"Without faith, boy, you can't taste the sacred juice"
Always hurry times, fury won't wait for you
So many enemies, yet the greatest you'll face is you
Instead, I wasted juice, pourin' them for painful lessons
An age old question, answered with fame rejections
Always tryin' to get older, but the older I get
More I remember her words that I chose to forget
More I regret
Not listenin' the first time around
Never drank her advice
Now I'm thirsty to drown
And how well her wisdom is swimmin', the nod she has
But I gotta move forward, can't live in the past
She would laugh
Tell me how she told me so
That she kiss me and hold me close
My mama said

Repeat Chorus

[Diamonique] Oh, oh, oh
             Baby
             Baby, stay right with me
             Yes, they will
             Just wait and see
[Fingazz]    "Fin-Fingazz on the track..."
[Diamonique] Yeah
             Yeah
             Just wait and see
             Yeah
             Yeah
             Just wait and see</pre>
