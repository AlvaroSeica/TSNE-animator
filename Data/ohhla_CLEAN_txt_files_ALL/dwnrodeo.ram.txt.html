[Zack de la Rocha]
Yeah I'm rollin down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a, brown skin man 
since their grandparents bought one

So, now I'm rollin down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a, brown skin man 
since their grandparents bought one

So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with a shotgun!

Bangin this bolo tight, on this solo flight can't fight alone
Funk the track my verbs +Sly+ like the +Family Stone+
The pen devils set that stage for tha war at home
Locked without a wage, ya standin in the drop zone
The clockers born, starin at an empty plate
Mamma's torn hands, cover her sunken face
We Hungry But Them Belly Full
The structure is set ya never change it with a ballot pull
In the ruins there's a network for the toxic rock
School yard to precinct, suburb to project block
Bosses broke south for new flesh and a factory floor
The remains left chained to the powder war

[Chorus]
Cain't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse!!
So make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first!!
Cain't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse!!

So now I'm rollin down Rodeo with a SHOTGUN
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
since their grandparents bought one!

Yes, I'm rollin down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
since their GRANDPARENTS bought one!

So now I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a SHOTGUN!

{Tom Morello's guitar solo}

Yeah..
Bare witness to the sickest shot while suckas get romantic
They ain't gonna send us campin like they did my man Fred Hampton
Still we lampin, still clockin dirt for our sweat
A ballot's dead so a bullet's what I get
A thousand years they had the tools, we should be takin 'em
FUCK the G-ride, I want the machines that are makin' em!
Our target straight with a room full of armed pawn 
to off the kings out tha west side at dawn

[Chorus]
Cain't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse!!
Make a move and plead the fifth 'cause ya can't plead the first!!
Cain't waste a day, when the night brings a hearse!!

So now I'm rollin down Rodeo with a SHOTGUN
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
since their GRANDPARENTS bought one!

Yeah, I'm rollin down Rodeo with a shotgun
These people ain't seen a brown skin man
since their GRANDPARENTS BOUGHT ONE!

Yeah I'm rollin' down Rodeo wit a SHOTGUN!!

{The rungs torn from the ladder, can't reach the tumour
One god, one market, one truth, one consumer..}

JUST A QUIET, PEACEFUL DANCE!!
..
JUST A QUIET, PEACEFUL DANCE!!!
YEAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!
..
JUST A QUIET, PEACEFUL DANCE!!!
..
JUST A QUIET, PEACEFUL DANCE!!!!!!
..
{whispers} 
Just a quiet, peaceful dance.. 
for the things we'll never have..
Just a quiet, peaceful dance... 
for the things we don't have..
