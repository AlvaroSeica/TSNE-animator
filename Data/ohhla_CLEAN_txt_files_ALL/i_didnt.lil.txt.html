L.E.S. big thangs
T west how was I supposed to know
Check it

[Verse One]
The first night I laid eyes on her my first reaction was whoa
The baddest chick I'd ever seen backstage at a show
She noticed me got my 3rd page in a row
I'm tryin' not to answer I'm knowin' I can always get that dancer
I told her I'm just lookin' for a chance to kick it wit u
Spit some game maybe exchange digits wit you
The one that u could say I missed you J
She smiled at that and said I gotta go I wish you'd stay
That night we must have talked for like 2 hours
Discussin' everything from my tour to If the world could be pure
To where to I was bouta take her in the silver azure
When she touched me felt like all my ill's had been cured
Ayyo if this the kinda love my parents warned me about
Im in trouble dial 911 clap from the double
I'm fadin' fast maybe you can save me
You know I'm tryin' to run from this man I'm took young for this

[Chorus]
I didn't know where love was taken me, me and you, this is all so new
I didn't know that love could hurt so bad feel so good I didn't know
I didn't know where love was taken me, me and you, this is all so new
I didn't know that love could hurt so bad feel so good I didn't know

[Verse Two]
Now every time I look at her its like the very first time
Butterflies like before I spit my very first rhyme
Imma playa I ain't possed to feel those things
And my boys oh my God if I reveal those things
They'll let me have it still I'm drawn like a attic
Skittin' drastic like a kid with advanced mathematics
So confused and I don't know what to do
Got me showin' how I feel by hidin' it from my crew
I can't control the way I feel is it wrong the way I feel
By losin' my focus am I throwin' away my deal
Cause this too could be a thing that in time shall pass
My heart is burning but all that comes from fire is ash
And I ain't feelin' burning crash
Viscous smiles and all of that is passed like 99' (?)
I never love a chicken but my dime shall shine
I'm wit whatever baby I hope the feelin' lasts forever

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
And now its February South Beach together
True is the sun and the enevitable is near thought my tour is comin'
And I'll be out about 16 weeks or so
So naturally I'm tryin' to thin of times that she could go
What she said froze my thoughts stopped me in mid walk
While I'm goin' overseas it would be best if we didn't talk
She couldn't take the heartbreak and deeper than that
She wanted me to tour on freedom and we'll see when I'm back
And I ain't met a girl competing with that
Instead of always tryna save her place mami gave me space
So as I saw the tear trickle down her angel face
Couldn't take the pain from her I turned and walked away from her

[Chorus] - repeat until end

I didn't know
How was I suppossed to know
that I would meet that one
its not supposed to be like this</pre>
