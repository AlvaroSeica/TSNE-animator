Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
I be dead fresh like I'm layin in a coffin
400$ shoes so I guess I'm Coogi walkin
Knitted hat and Knitted sweater call me coogi shawty
Coogi coogi coogi, coogi in my closet

[Verse 1]
I'm fresher than a mannican
Outfit extravagant
Stupid coogi fit and the color is lavender
Hit the coogi store and I'm huntin like a scavenger
I be coogi shawty, all these niggas amateur
Muray shoe walkin and my feeties is a mannimal
400$ coogi shoes, walkin with some stamina
Knitted coogi sweater for my vacation in Canada
I be dead fresh so I may stink like a mammal
Coogi coogi coogi, that's all I can handle
Coogi and this ice got me lookin like a candle
Coogi coogi coogi, that's all I can handle
Coogi and this ice got me lookin like a candle

[Chorus: x2]
I be dead fresh like I'm layin in a coffin
400$ shoes so I guess I'm Coogi walkin
Knitted hat and Knitted sweater call me coogi shawty
Coogi coogi coogi, coogi in my closet

[Verse 2]
Coogi in my closet
I'm a coogi junkie
Serve all the junkies, just for coogi money
I be dead fresh so I'm a coogi zombie
Blowin stanky funky, on a coogi monday
I stay stupid fruity coogi, they think that it's funny
I be fresher any coogi than the coogi dummy
Coogi head to toe, ridin' in that humma
I rock coogi so much, I put coogi on my momma
Coogi all winter, Coogi all summa
God damn juice, you put coogi on ya homeboi
I be coogi shawty, so coogi ma cologne boi
Young juiceman put coogi on his homeboys

[Chorus: x2]
I be dead fresh like I'm layin in a coffin
400$ shoes so I guess I'm Coogi walkin
Knitted hat and Knitted sweater call me coogi shawty
Coogi coogi coogi, coogi in my closet</pre>
