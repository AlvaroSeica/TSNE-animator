[Napoleon]
I live the life of a rockstar, manage the guitars
Everywhere we go, we V.I.P., cuz we hoodstars
Connected with the world's richest misunderstood czars
Ten bedroom mansions, in them woods far
The ice glisten, thirsty six core, we slicing percision
Living Bad Charlie, white as tradition
My street anthems sacred like Christ is religion
(Money, cars, and clothes, that's how gangstas roll)
Laid up in the Hilton, I'm like Michael Milkin
Devil's Advocate, slow mass a mill' then
We turn session A projects to crack buildings
Trying to make a better way, for the black children
That those essential, jealous foes thought the Rolls was a rental
Still the terms, bound the clothes, confidential
I'm real once disposed, I leave 'em foes in the mental
(Money, cars, and clothes, that's how gangstas roll)
Yeah, I got my swagger back, whatever ya'll smoking on
I'm like a bag of that, a 20 gram slabber crack
Bump with a pimp like Goldie, come and dazzle mack
Only thing missing, some shafts on they Cadillac
I stay loyal, caked up like I play for the Royals
These screaming, every day, if they oil
I never get popped with the damned foil
(Money, cars, and clothes, that's how gangstas roll)
Sky blue Bathing Ape, I'm a survivor like the winner of Amazing Race
Rawer than a Asian ape
Only dough we make that's illegal, stays in the safe
Twenty five million or better, time to raise a stake
Club life we sit bottles, then we twist models
Make 'em go down low like pig snoggle
I only catch feeling if your chick swallow
(Money, cars, and clothes, that's how gangstas roll)
No doubt we true dons, in the yukon
Watching the satellite, baby, Jimmy Neutron
Hoping that the judge give my mans and them a new bond
Only thing them crackers respect, is a true con
The streets know my life's official, hustle like some drizzle
Handle rocks like the great white pistol
Pole so hot, my flames in light missiles
(Money, cars, and clothes, that's how gangstas roll)
Now it's time to sum it up, to thank my man
Not rich, our hate is dumb as fuck, the black Phillip Drumming, what
Thugged out in tuxedos, Gucci's and button ups
Everybody wanna be down all of a sudden, but
Nah, D, I gotta blow, we got a lot of dough
It's either music or, move the whole pile of snow
The jewels that we got on our neck, really they not for show
(Money, cars, and clothes, that's how gangstas roll)
Now I'm bout to close the chapter, no longer o's of Casper
I got the bowls, so the photo's can capture
Solo's to rapture, damn, took a look at me now
A guest feature? So goes the laughter
Me, I'm in my after life, stones fracture life
Anything ya'll got, we can match it twice
Eighty five hundred a feature, if you ask polite
(Money, cars, and clothes, that's how gangstas roll)</pre>
