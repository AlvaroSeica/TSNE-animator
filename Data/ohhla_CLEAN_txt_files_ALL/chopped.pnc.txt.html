[Chorus-Kangol Slim]
Ya fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down
Ya fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down

[Kangol Slim]
Nigga I draws heat, just like a Deserted Eagle travelin' in land
With two forty-fives in my hand, me and my man, we bustin' heads open
No we not jokin' trigger finger strokin', bustin' niggas who disrespect
Head wide open, now you can let 'em buck you up if ya want
If you cross this fuckin' click you gettin' stanked like a skunk
Stankin' shit like a skunk, we leavin' bodies a smell
They gone find you face down in the Calvin Canal
Nigga this game is real, this niggas here, do kill
If he came to it, trigger play know we ain't lame to it
So you can let them nigga's send you on that fuckin' mission
We gonna chop you  up like boneless chicken
In a Chinese kitchen

[Chorus-Kangol Slim]
Ya fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down
Ya fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down
Fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down
Fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down

[Mista Menor]
Well fuck it, go ahead might as well bust it
All I see is busters I know they can't touch me
Now peep me out, check me out
This is how it happen, them boys be about that rappin'
See I be bought that scrappin', fuck the rappin' cause
It's skills that I'm packin', only with two niggas so ya know I ain't actin'
But niggas know how it go, I ain't no big nigga though
But it take no time to split a bitch nigga Cantaloupe
Bust 'em up one by one, niggas know how it's done
If it's not enough, then leave they fuckin' body numb
Crack bones, break bodies, it's on
You don't wanna fuck with this nigga
On to that B.G. you need to get yo own style
Cause right about now Magnolia Slim is goin' wild
But I'll have to teststyle you like a child, you Juvenile
I'll beat you down and make you Bow
Now respect me, or I'ma have to check you niggas
After whippin' one of y'all ass how the fuck ya figure you can't get with a
Nigga that's spankin' ass'es, breakin' glasses, I got nerve, cuttin' classes
Who you be? Well  I'm that skinny red nigga
Now who you be? Well, I'm that skinny red nigga
Well who you be? Well I'm that skinny red nigga
I'm bout to take it outside so I can cripple me a nigga

[Chorus-Kangol Slim-4x]
Ya fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down
Ya fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down

[Mista Menor]
That ain't Bout It

[Kangol Slim]
The fakest niggas to ever fuckin' shout it
Thinkin' they scared of nigga, cause they fuckin' mouth is crowded

[Mista Menor]
With gold's, nigga what kind of title you think you hold
Up in that Boot, ya draftin' niggas, you think that's cute
He a sissy, might as well call that nigga Missy
The game is pissy, his hoe ass ways kinda fishy
Walkin' all swishy

[Kangol Slim]
Man you steal sell shake?

[Mista Menor]
Represent this bitch for real

[Kangol Slim]
And stop representin' fake

[Chorus-Kangol Slim]
Ya fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down
Ya fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down
Fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down
Fuckin' with them Hounds, from G-Town we don't mess around
Come get that ass straight Chopped Down</pre>
