{Notorious B.I.G.} *X4*
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal

{Notorious B.I.G.}
It's rules to this shit

[Intro: AZ]
Yea, enough respect
+The Bad Boy+, +Death Row+, +No Limit+
+Rap-a-lot+, +Roc-a-fella+, +Cash-Money+, +Ruff Ryders+
+So-So-Def+, +The Inc.+
And all the incarcerated Scarfaces from ghetto to ghetto
Now introducin' to you a new Empire
+Quiet Money Records+ and +Hush Management+
Formely presents - yours truly

[Verse One: AZ]
I'm praised for wicked word-play
Emerge from my Earth days
Was boxed in the bird cage
Now flock wit the mermaids
A shorty wop, 'til I copped then I turned age
Saw it unfold, certain wars is untold
Unsolved mysteries, coffins is closed
A carnival trickery, caution your role
Any slip-ups will be hauntin' your souls
So neva get it twisted nigga, keep an iron biscuit witcha
Beast promoted, the street's is coded
For the naked eye times is too deep to notice
Yea I specialize in rhymes, but I peep the bogus
On every known level, I'ma stone cold rebel
Clothes is crisp, I rolls gold the wrist
I was schooled how to tuck, hide and hold the fifth
How to crush, cut, divide and supply the sniff
So if the truth ain't need, then the truth can't be

[Hook: Rap Samples]

{Notorious B.I.G.}
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal

{Nas}
Peeps that's into Drug money, market into rap

{Notorious B.I.G.}
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal

{Prodigy of Mobb Deep}
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back

{Notorious B.I.G.}
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal

{Nas}
Peeps that's into Drug money, market into rap

{Prodigy of Mobb Deep}
The street's is ki's

{Notorious B.I.G.}
I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal

{Prodigy of Mobb Deep}
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back

[Verse Two: AZ]
From base powder to that hard rock white
We all hustlers, live that hard knock life
Some get knocked, and their hearts not right
Cuffed up in the AM and discharged at that night
We all know that the Narc's ain't nice
But - that's the price when your bars ain't tight
The Beast within, release within, you get caught-up, lose trust
You don't speak to friends, you lose lust
Rarely fuck, you just seekin' sin
You know thugs stay grizzly and love to get busy
The stakes is high, the bids is long
A few wakes niggaz cry, you live, you gon'
If you escape, rules apply, kids is born
And the game won't change; it's the same ol' thang

{Notorious B.I.G.}
It's rules to this shit

{Prodigy of Mobb Deep}
And I can't turn back

[Verse Three: AZ]
And my mind been backwards, since puffin' on them back-woods
Clutchin' on them clappers, and duckin' from them crackers
Neva been in Nappa, neva fuck wit no rappers
I'm so gon' wit it, but I'm so long winded
Seen the worst, when I seen my first
Body get caught, I was prolly this short
The victim right beside me, stretched on the sidewalk
But you neva seen a man cry, 'til you seen a man die
The killer shots, the realer the guap
If you could realer, then it's similar plots
And if not, you won't familiar, you a squealer
You no dealer you hot, fuck around get the whole block locked
But neva me, I've been Boss playin', cookin' up saut√©ing'
'Til I saw another door, I had to force a nigga way in
Now in all black wit the gloves and hat
I'm so deep in it, that I can't turn back
