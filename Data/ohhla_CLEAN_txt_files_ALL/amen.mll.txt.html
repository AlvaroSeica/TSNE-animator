[Intro]
I just wanna thank God
for all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health, for my family
And lettin me ball on these niggaz
Ha ha~!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the buildin (amen)
A couple real niggaz in the buildin (amen)
I'm finna kill niggaz in the buildin (amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (preach)
We make it light up like a church (preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (preach)
Do live on Sunday like a church (preach)

[Meek Mill]
Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom watch them bitches catch the holy ghost
Ery'time I step up in the dealer I be goin broke
Shorty wanna fuck me I say get on top and rollercoast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? {*laughing*} And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation when they test me I just pee Rozay
Last night, I went hard, peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on Magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin me, you guys should be doin y'all
I'm stackin money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Roley I be chillin
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Just bought my niggaz some 'caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggaz some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib, so big it came with a moat
for niggaz jumpin the fence, I hope you niggaz can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin 'bout how they livin
and loanin a little money and keepin 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin in my verses, I'm just tellin you the basics
of growin up with your friends and becomin the one that made it, yes Lord!
All gold, man I got these bitches sold
Talkin 'bout these other rappers gettin old is even gettin old
Worryin about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggaz poppin like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and yo' hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend yo' whole life puttin up
Ain't no tellin when I go, so there ain't shit that I'ma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer and then go get what I just prayed for
Let me church

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill] + (Jeremih)
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryin to win and shit
Devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by twelve o'clock, then 3 o'clock she wet again
I'm screaming oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryin to hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spendin like I hit the lotto!!
Cause it's a lot of

[Chorus]</pre>
