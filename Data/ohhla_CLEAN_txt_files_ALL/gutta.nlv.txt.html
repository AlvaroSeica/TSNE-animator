Verse One: {Tec-9}
Straight out tha gutta they label a nigga
As a problem to the other side but they just
Want to take me for a ride you ask the question on
Why I like to use the "N" word
Well that's the only way a nigga is heard
Now I'm young and I'm black that puts odds against me
I often carry the nine cuz I got to defend me
Gun shot to yo head now you dead uh huh
That mean some drama bout to happen 
Motherfucka, yeah I'm to much trouble
I can't stay at my mom's house
Mama goin' crazy thinkin' my time is runnin' out
So now I'm a nigga with a time limit
On top of all that I got hooked up on some hoe shit
They say I fit the description of a 187 suspect
So now the Parish Prison Blue is in effect
But this ain't nothin' to a brother 
Cuz I've handle shit like this once before
Because I'm straight out the gutta

Chorus: {Lil' Ya/Yella Boy}

They just want to take me for a ride a ride
Miss don't try to touch my nuts to see if I'll pull the trigger
They just want to take me for a ride a ride
Miss don't try to touch my nuts to see if I'll pull the trigger
They just want to take me for a ride

Verse Two: {Tec-9}

Now I'm out in the gutta nothin' but a trap
You can't survive if you can't stay strapped
So watch yo back gangster
I hear this story and I started to get hecked
I'm figurin' a plan so my boys can be protected
I ain't about to let this shit go down
Cuz before I go down I'm a show these niggas how to clown
You got yo strap I got my shit 
So what ya wanna do I'm bout to bring some drama to you
Now how do it feel to feal the steel of a real ass nigga
I know that you slipped because I'm bangin' and bangin'
At yo ass with the motherfuckin' hollow tip
I told you once before I got nuts I got heart and
Ammunition I'm a real ass nigga
Straight out tha gutta

Chorus: {2x}

Verse Three: {Tec-9}

Everyday there's a murder case in my hood
And them gangsters I grew up 
Still up to no good my nigga lyin' on the ground
All shot up and everybody no the motherfucka who did him up
Nigga da nigga da nigga uhh uhh watch yo back
Cuz I'm packin' the gat but ain't nobody sayin' a
Damn thing and I don't feel a nigga so
I'm lettin' my fuckin' nuts hang 
Machine gun, three eighty, AK, glock forty-five
With all that ammunition how the fuck you gonna stay alive!
I take out yo clip because shit gettin' deeper
I predict the future when i see ya I'm a kill ya
Cuz once live a nigga who tested my nuts
Yeah he's a sucker, because I clipped out
And shot the motherfucker it goes on and on
In the heart of the gutta 
Smokin' blunt after blunt we gettin'
High as a motherfucka 
I was a villain since my day of birth 
Yeah, I got popped with a pump but it didn't hurt
My big brother told me wrong he didn't teach me right
Cuz everyday I went to school I got into a fight
I ain't with that shit because it's really wasn't about that shit
Yeah, but I never let me guard down ya heard me

Chorus: {4x}</pre>
