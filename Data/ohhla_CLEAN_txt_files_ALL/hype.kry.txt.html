[Intro: International Eav (Kryme Life)]
You muthafuckas don't know, it's your time (uh, uh)
Kryme Life it's your year, 2006 (yeah, it's Kryme Life, nigga
Never get it confused, man) Show them muthafuckas what you working with baby
(This year, it's a whole 'nother ballgame, man) Oh shit, turn it up
(Nigga, it ain't for the fame, nigga) You muthafuckas don't know
(It's for the love, man) Turn this shit up (yo, yo)

[Kryme Life]
I made it throught the struggle, only me and my iron
Now it's my time to bubble, it's about to be trouble
Got a couple dogs with muzzles that keep quiet
Silencers muzzle sound when we pop off, try it
Throw a couple of rounds, the Stapleton, Broad Street
Marauders, where they keep eating, and them cameras keep
Recording, night to morning, niggas sold it
We ain't never scared, let shit fly everywhere
Yeah, you seeing the movement, ya'll ain't prepared for it
And can't compare nothing to it
What you think we here for, listen, business is booming
Set up the enterprise, minimize, we get to shooting
Ten years in the grind, your boy still gritty
Even though I scuff my Timbo's up in a few cities
Kept my beats and my product banging, niggas see me
Getting money now, so what's the new song, you singing, come on
You can't be serious, yo

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
I'll let these niggas front like they nice
They not M.C.'s, just wannabes with mics
I see you in it, but your gimmick ain't tight
Like P.E. said, don't believe the hype (homeboy)
Understand, I got my cash flow right
Yo, I'm about to show you what the rap flow like
Just give my niggas the mic
T.M.F. to death, C.G.'s for life, let's go
'06, Ruffline

[Kryme Life]
It's Kryme, ya'll niggas know me, from going hard with my homey
Pumping these packages, never turn my back on my Co-D
Whether through, thick or thin, sink or swim
We probably came out on top, cuz we think to win
And get big, never fold under pressure, controlling my stresses
Unloading on these asses, send them back to the essence, cuz
We don't allow phony niggas in our presence
They only respect violence, so now they getting the message
We killas moving in silence, got style and we trendsetters
Hard dungaries, fresh white tee's and French leathers
I step in the booth with a vendetta, and a way
For supe with the new severs, my niggas we been better, it's whatever

[Chorus]

[Kryme Life]
You just mad cuz you can't flow with us, and your label debating
How to take out the trash, like sanitation
Got a problem with a man, I'mma stand and face him, for real
Never ran, never will, and I come from Staten
Where we packing, like killas in Brownsville
Since I came up, your career been downhill
Step your game up, we flamed up, you won't chill
Other words like ice in the cooler, these niggas is nice
Saying the same shit twice, could of fooled us
Kryme Life, rugged, never smooth
Like M.O.P., '93, real niggas kept me in the groove
I'm bout to bring this drama to these crews
And feed these bird niggas to my wolves like Tyson and Perdue
I got something to prove, I'm here to push product
Your block dead, without it, I got something to move
If your spot is crowded, I get niggas to move
You fucking with bosses, got to run ya'll the rules
What? Kryme Life, nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
