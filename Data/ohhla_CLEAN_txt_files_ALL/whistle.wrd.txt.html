[Werd]
Ha, check, its my happy song
Sing along, Whistle along

First off dont matter about sales
I might trail, but it shines, snail
Some cats look depressed, fail
So cheer up dog, wag-wan tail (haha)
(Christians) Christian Bale
Walk in my scene, and Ill raise hell
And aim for heaven, I've been through as well
But I keep here still, gel
And I've got some skills, but no Nas
It aint hard to tell
I got bars, my heads in a jail
And in the ocean of thought I set sale
Trying to sell this, when their buying fertilizer 
(Shit) I guess talk is cheap
But I cant be mad when Im on this beat

Its my whistling song
I cant whistle or I'd whistle along
Its my whistling song
I cant whistle or I'd whistle along like
(Yeah, Whistle along) Its my whistling song
Yeah, just whistle along

Listen, Wardie's running the rap thing
Madhat down south on that grime thing
Riddlah got married mate, thats a blessing
And Im still here myself, depressing (haha)
But I got to laugh a little bit
Because its all my own doing when it comes to it
Its all I ever damn do got no other shit
And when you've came this far, you try and quit
You'll see its not an option
You cant do it to yourself, or them
(Oh God) Sons doing it constant
Since teen, with a few sins he's lost in
So I just keep talking
And hearing then, I smile, often
Hearing them, give praise, rewarding
And with nothing, still happy, recording

Its my whistling song
I cant whistle or I'd whistle along
Its my whistling song
I cant whistle or I'd whistle along like
(Yeah, Whistle along) Its my whistling song
Yeah, just whistle along

Scant Squad (whistle along)
Wardie Burns (just whistle along)
Perfect Practice (Im not whistling alone)
UVBeatz (we just whistle along)
Madhat (just whistle along)
Deeko (Im not whistling alone)
Jordan Butler (Im dont whistle alone)
Z.A. (I cant whistle or I'd whistle along)
Mog and Nity Gritz

Its my whistling song
I cant whistle or I'd whistle along
Its my whistling song
I cant whistle or I'd whistle along like
(Yeah, Whistle along) Its my whistling song
Yeah, just whistle along</pre>
