I met this kid named billy who said he could do anything
as long as he believed it from his toes to his brain
his belief was the size of a mustard seed
which was enough to move the mountains and us into the sea
you could walk through walls and run on water
but that gets you no where so why even bother
in his past life, kamala called him Siddhartha
in his last life, he was a drunk who raped his daughter
hes been it all before, in a dream called existence
his skin and it's color is the only thing that's different
but he's just a little boy with a propeller cap
with a grin on his face like it's all an act
he knows the world's not real and everything is what you think
he blinked once made the sun purple and the grass hot pink
he clapped twice and turned an airplane into a seagull
earth is his canvas, the universe is his easel

oh buddha billy won't you teach me your ways
tell me I never had an ego and there's no such thing as hate
teach me forgiveness and eliminate my guilt
tell me this world isnt real lets watch reality melt

imagine nothingness, no possessions, no baggage
no distractions, no addicts, no passions or habits
some may call it ignorant, negative or apathetic
but karma's just everything you ever regretted
nothings real except god but he aint here
cuz this world's just a projection of your guilt and fear
he said you talk when you arent at peace with your thoughts
and your fragrance shall be my breath until the apple rots
he said trees don't grow in each other's shadows
I blinked once he was behind me, with thought he could travel
he told everybody the truth of why we exist
if this was Rome he would of been on a crucifix
but he got mugged downtown, they asked him for his money
he smiled and gave em everything, like your average dummy
I forgive you is all that he said
and when he turned around they put a bullet in his head

oh buddha billy there's a bullet head
he said thank you, another women shall bear me
why little billy there a bullet in your head
he said thank you, another women shall bear me

oh buddha billy won't you teach me your ways
tell me I never had an ego and there's no such thing as hate
teach me forgiveness and eliminate my guilt
tell me this world isnt real lets watch reality melt</pre>
