[Buckshot]
yeah uh,uh,uh
uh, yeah
Back up in the motherfuckin place
Real shit to ya face
you know how we do
we gonna show y'all nigas how we roll in the BK Side
Feel this
straight like that hardcore shit to ya back
my dog hi-tek is on da motherfuckin boards
and I'm gonn' steep for a minute and tell y'all
motherfuckers who I be
 
[Verse 1]
Blaw! Here comes the BDI thug
Buckshot, shorty with da gat tucked by the rug
It's kinda bugged niggas said I fell off on tracks
you see this dick, u fell off on that, u sell off crack
That don't mean u pop collars or drop dollars
you could be a spot watcher watch yo spot
or better yet watch da stain on yo shirt
Buckshot put ya brain on your shirt
and that's the main reason that I'm hre
Buck spit, Hi-tek beats beez in yo ear
you see buck, you see trees in da air
D's in da chair, tied up screaming for air
Little buck with big bucks, spend a little on a good dick suck
you can get this nut or that nut, huh
both for da nut, throw for a the gut, duke u gon' go for da buck
that means u go for this and go for that
and got nothing to show for that
Stick with Buck, don't need coke or crack
I teach u how to rhyme now u a joking rack
 
[Chorus][2x]
why they wanna act up
wanna get smacked up
everybody back up, what!
hit yo back up, huh
say sumthin'
everyday I lace sumthin
I see niggas stay frontin
 
[Verse 2]
yo, I don't really give a fuck about those who
don't give a fuck about me cuz
All I wanna do is cock lead, get bread
live live and get hed wicked in bed
Shabbah Rank no. 1 dick, I'ma give yo chick till tomorrow
Beg &amp; borrow, yeah that's the hood motto
but you shouldn't follow shit that don't bring no do
you just swing low
huh, and I was taught to aim high, take over your shit call
it shanghai
I heard you wanna bang why?
It must be a reason for that
Damn videos, that gotta be the reason for that
cuz man listen, in some hoods you end up missin
snatched with yo pants down while you pissin
It's like an intermission, or better more like a song
cuz I got u listening that long
and all my true fans, I stick by y'all
and all you fake niggas I lick fire
That's when I melt hot rocks and spit larva
Buck spit saliva on your shoe
and tell you slide off with your crew
and if you rap I tell u slide off the boot
and slide off with your boo, cuz your bitch is mine too
You cop my bootleg and bit this rhyme too
goddamn nigga, your kid is mine too
take shit I'm designed too
Don't even sweat that
just when you lighting up
I leave you jet black
 
[chorus]
 
This that ill shit, the illest it get
You talk shit but you still on the dick
You can stay flock, but it still gonna hit 
as I pop yo top like this (2x)</pre>
