[Intro] 
Powder! Let's go!

[Chorus]
I know you wanna be with your boy, but you can't, and it's stressful
I ain't mean to break your heart, but I did, I'm regretful
And it would be a lie if I said, what we had, wasn't special
Although I had to let you go, you should know, I'll never forget you
(I'll never forget you) I'll never forget you (I'll never forget you) I'll never forget you 
(I'll never forget you baby) I'll never forget you, you should know, I'll never forget you

[Verse One]
Now how the fuck could I forget Destiny?
Shorty bought out the best and the fresh in me
She was just a little older with a baby girl
But I'm a young nigga still tryin to see the world
I knew it wouldn't work but I dragged along
Reminisce about her while I take drag of the strong
God damn that bitch was fine!
Good food good moves with the bump and grind
But the fights was bad, my other hoes was mad
Took the numbers out my phone and she called they ass
Makin threats with a follow through, bitch I'm a follow you
She always want me stay up in the house but I gotta do
Things in the street like get this money
When you be's in the streets you'll get them honeys
Hid away get in a comb short stay get 'em gone
I was gettin back to her couldn't wait now she gone
Word!

[Chorus]
I know you wanna be with your boy, but you can't, and it's stressful
I ain't mean to break your heart, but I did, I'm regretful
And it would be a lie if I said, what we had, wasn't special
Although I had to let you go, you should know, I'll never forget you
(Oooh!) I'll never forget you (Oooh!) I'll never forget you 
(Oooh!) I'll never forget you, you should know, I'll never forget you

[Verse Two]
Chesapeake, you triflin bitch!
I'll never forget the day you sucked another nigga dick
Back in high school, 2003
You the main reason these hoes gotta deal with me
Present day May bae, you was 'posed to be my wife
You 'posed to have my baby, we 'posed to have a life
Things don't always go how they supposed
We 'posed to be in jail for all them trips on the road
Reminiscin 'bout my silver Benz
You and Xanthe in the back breakin forty thousand into stacks of tens
I ain't gon' front, it's plenty times I miss you
I won't put you on front, but you had your issues
Some due to me, shit I was doin me
I do the same to Nae, I did the same to Ri
I'm a work in progress, I'm improvin me
But when a woman's fed up, get the eulogy

[Chorus]
I know you wanna be with your boy, but you can't, and it's stressful
I ain't mean to break your heart, but I did, I'm regretful
And it would be a lie if I said, what we had, wasn't special
Although I had to let you go, you should know, I'll never forget you
(Oooh!) I'll never forget you (Oooh!) I'll never forget you 
(Oooh!) I'll never forget you, you should know, I'll never forget you

[Verse Three]
R.I.P. to Pop Pop I miss my nigga
I get the chills when I spit there's no tissue nigga
I ain't cry since your funeral no tears left
And it's been over twelve years ago since you left
You had the gold Rolex I got on mine today
I remember you use to play Billie Holiday
And like her, "I'll Be Seeing You"
Oh! Later on some day
Playin pool you once cracked a fool head with the 8 ball
I'm just like you hit crackheads with the eight ball
New cars yeah I'm into that
Remember how you would do broads, yeah I'm livin that
Say your quote everyday, no man is smarter than the next
It's the one who works hardest that achieve success
Carry myself with respect put mu'fuckers in check
You live through me get your rest my grandfather God bless
Word!

[Chorus]
I know you wanna be with your boy, but you can't, and it's stressful
I ain't mean to break your heart, but I did, I'm regretful
And it would be a lie if I said, what we had, wasn't special
Although I had to let you go, you should know, I'll never forget you
(Oooh!) I'll never forget you (Oooh!) I'll never forget you 
(Oooh!) I'll never forget you, you should know, I'll never forget you

[Outro]
I'll never forget you
If I got it, then you got it, it's no issue
It was a lotta bullshit I put them through
But every girl that I named is official
In the words of the Reverend P. Diddy while I sip this liquor, (take dat, take dat) liquor
Some of these bitches, they roll harder than your niggaz, heh
And everybody know it's a fact, Troy Ave beatin up this track
Yea nigga, yea you know how I'm strapped
Everyday I'm down for that clack - Powder!
I'm a lesson teacher, I don't learn shit
I'm hardheaded, doin the same to my bitch right now
But if you hold a nigga down then I promise you'll go to the top with me
Stay at the top with me,where you supposed to be
Just be patient B, kno'mean?
Don't beef with me, then leave me for the next man
He gon' do the same damn thing, and not be as dope as I am
How do that make sense?
I been fuckin mad bitches and they leave they man
And I'm like "Damn!", you was beefin with that nigga for cheatin
But you fuckin with me, I'm just a slam -- dunk 
Lay up, hit 'em in the back of the trunk, in the parking lot
Yea, I did that, that's a fact tho, Troy Ave oh
I get stacks to blow, but I don't spend 'em on no bitches
Trickin ain't shit, I don't care how much riches you got
BSB niggaz straight to the top, I even smoke a lil' bit of pot
But I specialize in havin drug spots... allegedly
Enjoy the album!</pre>
