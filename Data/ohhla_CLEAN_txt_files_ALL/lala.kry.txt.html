[Intro: Tommy Whispers (Kryme Life)]
God damn, yo, Kryme, man, how much you could smoke man?
Another fucking blunt, nigga?
(Yeah, man, you know I gotta do it man)
You smoke alotta fucking weed, man
(Yeah, it ain't nothing, man)
You must got a weed plant in your crib, or something, man
Yo, man, all you do is blow weed, nigga
All you do is fucking smoke (roll that shit up, son)
God damn, you got bamboo, dutches, philly, white owls
Nigga... you talking all that shit
Pass that L, man, pass that, you O'treeing, nigga
Shit, man, all you do is smoke, smoke and smoke

[Kryme Life]
My eyes stay low from the purple haze, yes
The cessamillia'll ease the brain, no
The kid never had to fuck with 'caine
Or any other one of them things, I just sling and
Even though the song here be about a buzz
I still tell kids just say no to drugs
Cuz you don't wanna have to grow up like I was
Even though my intentions was high as the sky was
As I think of all the things I did to buy buds
In school I acted up, many classes I cut
Wasn't thinking bout much, but the bag and the dutch
I can remember, Mary had me sprung, since I was a shorty
Trooping up to the Hill, straight to 240
Me and my nigga Shy, going to see Chocolate Tai
Cuz I like the way she smell, plus I love her complexion
And the way she make me feel right after a session
I got knocked fucking with her, I still ain't learn my lesson
I just wanted her more after all that stressing
Every chance I get, I got a blunt in my hand
And if they offer still with me, take a drug program, cuz I

[Chorus 2X: Kryme Life]
Get, smoke, pass that, smoke that
Breathe, trees, trees, they good for my art
The more I smoke, the more I write darts

[Kryme Life]
This one's for my dutch masters, blunt wrappers
Niggas that shotgun and roll up, baseball bats
My backwood hoods, them white owl prowlers
My philly boy sit in the crib and smoke ounces
Lighting up the evergreen, blowing in the mezzanine
I can smoke a thousand blunts, but I never lean
Just in case a nigga wanna scheme, I lay you out
Treat you like seeds in my weed, I'll take you out
Can't outsmoke me, son, you got virgin lungs
Please, I burn exotic leaves, blue berry sour d's
White widow, all kind of trees, skunk pillows
Arizona mixed with hasshish, getting no sleep
All night cyphers, cuz we got enough charm
Ran out of papers to roll, I started hitting the bong
For dolo, because my partner didn't wanna be a doner
If you can't support your habit, then you ain't a true stoner
I love me some marijuana, ain't nothing like the ganja
I'm colder, when I'm sober, but you know I gotta blow and get

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
