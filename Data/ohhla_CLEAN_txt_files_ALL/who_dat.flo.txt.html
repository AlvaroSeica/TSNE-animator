[Flo Rida]
Hey! Miss Red Carpet, she can autograph my pockets
Any time, any place, any day, I'll be lookin at e'rybody else watchin
I don't wanna be obnoxious, but this girl worth the gossip
Take away the smile, the tattoos now, forever she there regardless
I imagine her topless, she might set off my rocket
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 on and poppin
She met Mark and then, attitude like we arguin
Return by my side, I bring glitter to my life
I should twitter this girl is sparklin

[Chorus: Akon]
She ain't no rock star, but she got groupies
She ain't no actress, but she make movies
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breakin they neck like
Who dat girl? {*3X*}
She ain't got riches, but she got fashion
She ain't a model, but cameras flashin
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breakin they neck like
Who dat girl? {*3X*}

[Flo Rida]
Hey! They wanna know her momma name
Cause that's where she get it from
They ain't never shot her with silicone
Shawty is her and her is she the real one
Touch one, grab one, feel one
I wish she woulda told me that
Ain't nuttin wrong brangin the old me back
Lil' momma know her body so trophy glass
She worked it and brought some Chloe bags
like damn! Can I be the police badge?
Pull it over get a little cozy and
Reminisce sorta like a oldie jam
Record some ish on a Playboy cam
She ain't no actress, the movie's on my matress
Rock star, none of that practice
But still she got fanatics

[Chorus]

[Interlude 2X: Akon]
Ohh-oh-ohh-oh-ohh
Look at her go-oh-ohh-oh-ohh
I wanna know-oh-ohh-oh-ohh
Who dat girl {*3X*}
