(various talking and intros)

[I.G. Off]
It's the top dog and you just the man next to the man like Christ
Swappin' advice over a game a-dice I'll live a high life
Higher than the highest mountain, deeper than any sea
Wreckin' careers until the day I D-I-E like B.I.G.
Got what you be wantin', styles for analyzin' and beats that's thumpin
Ill tracks keep bodies jumpin' like loaded Macs
Knowledge the facts, never speed or never get too relaxed
If I was you, I play the back like the wing on a coupe
My technique is invincible when I'm dancin' over the right loop
And I don't care what you doin', just stack lucci like Susan
I hate losin', that's why I push myself to keep improvin'
My words make me immortal, I get respect like a corporal
Runnin' through town with rebels
trapped in a chess game with the devil
I only move with the Highest, I'm hazardous like L.A. riots
And I'm-a keep spreadin' until I got a body count like a virus

[J-Treds]
Yo, yo, yo..check... yo that's wha-...
Yo when J's in the place, competition is like "You're the man"
Cuz when I bust I blow the spot like an insurance scam
Leavin' in ashes when I blaze it, I'm not to be played with
Rated R son, PG emcees don't really say shit
So I curse 'em with my version of dope 
Burnin' their hopes of masterin' this
they're forever learnin' the ropes
While I proceed in full swing, doin' it for self
Weaker emcees need help, so they gotta pull strings
But can't match the force of this one man, if they understand 
They won't test, I got a dark side like an uneven sun tan
They don't wanna see it, it's too ill, and it's far from beau-ti-ful
They catch a glimpse, it's a view to a kill
Cuz no one lives to talk about it when I'm on the set
That's why my comp is pet cuz it's a promise not a threat
I'm dead honest, if you heart is tellin' your state
You betta listen to your concious sayin' "Jet..."
cuz I jam like a tech
What, what, What's up Thirst...

[Thirstin Howl III]
Thirstin Hooowlll..ha...Thirstin Hoowwwlll...still in there
Yo, what...
I put rappers in danger for darin' rescues
I'm to be avoided is a daily schedule
At all costses, Rap Olympics
I'll get the gold before you see the torch lit
Take crowns even if they don't fit
Make ciphers take wrong turns 
Battle 80 niggaz and have enough rhymes to go first!
Verbally sparrin' you hit as hard as womens boxin'
You could lose or you could lose, those are your options
My freestyle is straighter than a wheel alignment
With rack opinion steering, studying the nervous systems
Pressure points and body piercings!
My freestyle is stronger than all alcoholic beverages
After second sips to the point to where you forget where you live!
My freestyle is dumber than Jim Carrey and his co-star
Even if you was En Vogue's PANTIES you couldn't hold on
Your freestyle, a non-sinner's son who twiddle thumbs
From the sight of my rib cage you could tell I kill for crumbs!
My freestyle, clearer than a ocean front wit' seagulls
My flow will feel like I'm walkin' the sands
with a corn pipe and a pea coat!
Carryin' a slow burnin' lantern
These fingers here could pick pocket a grass skirt
Your freestyle in a test of strength was the perfect weight
So it's logical we obey the 3-knockdown rule
Whether you married to the mob or just a step-son
I make true to the game emcees rhyme under lie detectors!

[Hazadus]
What?  Check check...now...
My freestyle is something that you have read about in books
When I talk to takin' jooks or these brothers wanna take looks
I...throw left hooks just like Tyson, nice on the mic devices
Slicin' and dicin' for any pricin'

[I.G. Off]
Yo, yo well I never get off the stage without 50 pats on the back
About 50 more pounds and 'bout 60 more "Yo, you ripped thats"
We terrify, petrify, any emcee who dare to try
I turn on some Canibus shit, whoever wanna die, I'll battle you...

[Kwest]
Always talkin' about they wanna battle us
You're there relyin', they about to get they whole body set on fire
I perspire from the sweat, you ain't even seen nothin' yet
Me and I.G. Off, I.G. Off on the set, Kwest the verbal vet

[I.G. Off]
I wait for niggaz to talk about they multi-platinum plaque
So I could smack 'em in they fuckin' mouth with they plaque
I break your back, smack these corny ass emcees silly
I grab 'em by they legs break they feet off like a Philly
