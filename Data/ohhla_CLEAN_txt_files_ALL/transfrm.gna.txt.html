[Hook 2X]
I, I, I, I, I, I
Know how to transform, I transform
I transform, I'm a transformer

[Verse]
(I can do it, I can do it
I'm just being myself)
(Plus I got to be me too)
Silly of me to think that I
Couldn't bring myself to be you
Ah, but behold there is benevolence
Behind this, but don't stare though
(Careful) (Cause I'll kill you) (With kindness)
That's why I'm dressed quite neatly
Cause it's easy, and discreetly they seek me
And when they reach me and see me
They believe me completely
I'm a real live wire, I ain't lyin'
Just between me and you, I ain't dyin'
I can transform, I can transform
I can transform, without even tryin'

[Hook 2X]

[Verse]
(Now I'm someone else)
(Now someone can be me too)
Behold the beautiful and bold
Everyday I wake up to be new
Ah, but it's simple, but I still can't understand why
"I think I can, I think I can, I think I can" (Oh, can I?)
I'm a microchip off the old block, you know not
But I was a robot, and I sold rock
And you would get for sure shot with a gold Glock
Boy I rode Pac
Somethin' that you won't see again
What the hell? Might as well be a friend
I can transform, and I transform
No telling who I'll have to be again
