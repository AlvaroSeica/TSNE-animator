(Verse 1)
[Uno]   Hallelujah
        Baby, let me stroke your coat
        Do whatever you like
        Whatever float your boat
        Let me go downtown, make you moan and purr
        You like that, hun, yeah, I'm so superb
        Let's fly out to Vegas, elope and dance
[Tawny] We keep Doin' It and Doin' It
[Uno]   Get out them pants
        Set up the camera and take some pics {*cameras flashing*}
        Zoomin' all in, while I lick ya [{*clit*}]
[Tawny] Give it to me, daddy
[Uno]   Bout to take ya there
        All you smell is the sex in the air
        Yeah
        Bring out the ice, you my Sicko queen
        The whip and the cream, while I make you scream

Pre-Chorus:
[Uno]   Taste so sweet, wanna eat you daily
        Can't get enough of the kitty cat
[Tawny] You want it, want it
[Uno]   Yeah (Yeah)
[Tawny] You want it, want it
[Uno]   Yeah (Yeah)

Chorus: Tawny Heath
He loves my kitty cat (Kitty cat)
Uh hun, uh hun
Can't get enough of that (Nuff of that)
Na uh, na uh
He loves my kitty cat (Kitty cat)
Uh hun, uh hun
That boy can handle that (Handle that)
Na uh, na uh

[Verse 2: Mr. Lil' One {Tawny Heath}]
Oh goodness, gracious, thank the Lord
Brought Sexyback
On the bedroom floor (Floor...)
Back got back, got face and curves
Walk in the club, thugs go absurd
The type that'll make ya
Break it, word
Don't need anything to make you cuss or slur
I got a gangsta chick, that loves gangsta flicks
A freak in the sheet, so we practice it (Practice it...) {Yeah}
How many licks, will it take tonight
She said, "Come close, baby, I don't bite"
Won't you come lay down, let me rub you down...
Dim down the lights, let me love you down...

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Uno]   Uno
        Dos (Dos)
        Before I get ghost (Ghost)
        Break it all down, tell you what I love most (Most)
        The walk and the talk, can't forget your voice
        Your kitty cat, baby, oh, nice and moist
        Perfection, baby, at its finest right
        Teach it to the world when the time is right
        Classy
        Ghetto
        Tight in stilettos
        Sweet as an angel
        But act like a devil
        Yeah (Yeah...)
        Do it in the balcony
        Overlookin' the seat, just you and me
        I wanna taste you, baby
[Tawny] I wanna taste you, too
[Uno]   Cool, lights out, we know what we gotta do (Do...)

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus
