Chorus: Ese Daz
It, feels so, good, to
Be, alive
And I'm glad I made it
Everything is okay
Everything is alright
And after all I been, now I see the sunlight
So wake up, wake up
Get up, get up
Everything's gon' be alright
I just dust myself off, pop the sunroof top
And now I see sunshine

[Verse 1: Ese Daz]
I dig in the scene with a gangsta lean
Ahora was a good day, you know what I mean
I look up at the sky, only God can judge me
A smile on a face, cause I can care less what they say
So keep on
Talkin'
I'll keep
Stackin'
All my
Paper
Fuck all
Haters
But all the homies that got love for me
Just throw your dubs for me, represent with me
It's all brown love, when I'm in the club
I don't care where you from, let's just get all to rub
So Khool Aid and E-Dubb, won't you pop the bottle
While me and Lucky Luciano smoke a Cuban cigaro

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Lucky Luciano]
Man, I wake up and ball, cause I been through it all
Used to have be my feet, now I 20-inch-crawl
Never had no money
Elbows as (As shit)
That's why I stunt now, put my game down flat (Shit)
Started at the bottom
Now I'm at the top
I'm all on your T.V., showin' off my rocks
Don't touch that dial
I'm on your station
I could drop a freestyle if you show me the paper
It, feels so, good
I'm doin' my thang, my situation is lovely
Some drastic change from Ole E to the bubbly
Used to blow on kareoke, now the radio love me

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Ese Daz]
After all I been through, I can smile again
Sometimes, I pinch myself and count to ten
Cause it feels like a dream, nothing's going wrong
Nobody's diein'
No mothers cryin'
No ghetto chickens up makin' noise
And I'm surprised to see kids outside, playin' with toys
Huh
My Raiders won again, 28-10
And this club that I was (???) on my clothes, just let me in
Well, that's the goal, right, I see a mami lookin' tight
She walked up, "Ese, let's hook up
Later on tonight"
And now I'm feelin' I'm on top of the world
No more days, big and broke, strugglin' with, no hope
I'm just rollin' down Carson Street
With the top down, cruisin' to the H.A. streets
Huh
The cops didn't even pull me over today
Like Ice Cube
I had to say, "Today was a good day"
