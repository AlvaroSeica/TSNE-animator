[Intro: Hell Razah]
(Give me my money, man)
GGO International
We 'bout to shut down the capital building
Taking over from now on
The White House is black
Right now you got the young niggas up and coming that's cracking
I'm 'bout to bring 'em to you
First up is Cipha
After that you got T.C.
Sabac will get real ridiculous in the building right now
Yeah, where you at?

[Cipha]
Same cat but I bet I look big in a Humvee
Hating, don't want me with more croc than Dundee
Comfy, that hoe brass she don't hit banks
And I feel like just getting more rocks than fish tanks
Act dumb but these glocks don't spit blanks
Action, the shots that you do won't hit skanks
See, all this is just for MTV or BTP, balling in the NYC
I got the flow Boss tight, I'm not Hugo, I'm not you though
Spitting like I got to though, we got to blow
Get on and our block can go, then rocks will glow
Any problems let Cochrane know
Don't want trouble but just give me a reason
Take you Half Past Dead like your name is Steven
Can't be leaving the house, how can I say we're even?
Stopped your breathing with a couple of shots receiving
Not this evening, I'm tryna drop this season
Doing what I gotta do to find my spot then ease in
Never confusing, spitting, one day the producer
Whenever we prove we're holding
We don't need no improvements
Stop it, you losing, filthy comments, y'all need to get moving
So we start bruising way before the weapons get chosen

[Outro: Cipha]
Yea.. uh.. it's a change of plans right now, man
Change of plans, for real.. for real..</pre>
