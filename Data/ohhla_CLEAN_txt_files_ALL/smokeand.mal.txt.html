[Intro: No Malice]
When I was a child, I thought as a child
I talked like a child, I even reasoned.. like a child
But when I became a man, I put away childish things

[Ab-Liva]
It's like the blind leadin the blind, they caught up in the shine
The tokens of success is not clearly defined
The watermelon's gone, and all that's left is rind
And yet you keep eatin, eatin...
But in the back of your mind, if somewhat you rewind
Ever wonder why they continue to let you dine
Place a glass ceiling, continue to let you climb
Place drugs in the hood and pretendin to let you grind
That little job they pretendin to let you find
Boxed in, they continue to let you mime
That little deal they continue to let you sign
My nigga, they spent more on spilled wine
...I gotta speak to my kind
Call me 8:45 cause both hands on the 9
It's from the heart and it's so sincere in every rhyme
I could let the wheel go, the Lord steers every time
Shyeah, if no child left behind
Black faces on "The First 48" look like mine
Yeah, cause when that nigga in a bind
The ones in position from my view look like Shyne
Damn, and we the culprit in the crimes
In the pulpit, niggaz lyin, they just pokin at the lion
'Til my soul start flyin or fryin, I'ma be defiant
It's written on the wall like a Mayan

[Interlude: No Malice]
Y'know, the truth is a funny thing!
I mean... it's a double-edged sword
It separate bone from the marrow, spirit from the flesh
And if it's a lie, then say it's a lie
But if it's the truth.. and that saw hits you
All you better do.. is say OUCH!

{Ab-Liva over interlude}
When there's smoke, there's fire
For every truth, there's a liar
For every king, there's one higher
...
They say we're living in this hell now
Only gets to the core when it melts down
Can't speak from the heart, it's not felt now

[No Malice]
It's of a biblical proportion, what you are witnessing
Spiritual abortion, slaughter of innocents
Guilty as charged, destruction of a lineage
Now pray, Father God, you allow me to repent of it
And any crime scene that bear Malice's fingerprint
I pitched those keys like a tent, without thinkin
Even served our own mommas, without blinkin
Walking dead, clueless, no inkling
Within a twinkling, seein what I was made of
While y'all speculate Clipse break-up
Well think it not strange if I'm Abel to his Cain
Hell, even Esau had a Jacob,  I ain't trippin
And what's with all this swag I ain't feelin
Gotta get that money, huh? - Nah, I'm chillin
And I ain't sellin my soul for no million
Cause that dead-end rap can't even crack its glass ceiling~!
Why such blasphemy
and anger toward a God which none hath seen
Hmm, leads me to believe
That there's a wee bit more to this Jesus thing
And they use His name to sell them pies
Cause it take a lot of truth just to sell that LIE
YES! Even now I repent
Of the circus acts, same clowns, different tent

[Outro: No Malice]
I mean... if we gonna kill the kids...
..then let's kill the kids!
Pop that molly, right?
I mean, load them choppers, right?!
Homeboy, the line's been drawn
And if you find it evil to serve the Lord
Then choose THIS day, whom you will serve</pre>
