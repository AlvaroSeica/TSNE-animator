Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's Jay Renaissance Man, On the Red Eye from France
Passers by say the meteoric rise was happenstance
But everything is illuminated in retrospect
So I expect respect from the less introspect-
-ful on the next go, now let's go
Jay Quezo, niggas need a manifesto
Came in the game like presto
Unsigned hype, the five mics
Emcees is blinded by the light
Blinded by the right, right hook off the jab
Dip, I'm swift with the lyrical gift
Niggas is stiff, I'm fluid
That's how I pillage through the game like the druids
Now everybody and they mama askin around who is
Jay Electrotherapy, niggas in shock
I'm a workhorse, sending rappers into the workforce
It's the Chitown, New Orleans regime sprrrrrrrrat
Take that, and bow down to the kings naamean</pre>
