[Intro: Lion Heart (Makeba Mooncycle)]
They better listen to number seven (number seven)
Seven on donia, Salassie, Jah

[Chorus: Lion Heart]
Want kill rasta, can't kill rasta
Want kill rasta, but dem can't kill rasta
Do them try kill, but dem can't kill rasta
Bound carving knife of, now the Tride of Judah

[Lion Heart]
We gon' boom down, dem Twin Tower
Then we put the fire pon de Federal Plaza
Judgement, why cuz I not liar
See the fire, thy shore, we be the water
Dem could of never stopped, we roll or we get ya
So we put the fire, pon de toes go higher
Ice not hot, so we go on the macro
But me never wait, til tomorrow

[Chorus: Lion Heart]
Want kill rasta, can't kill rasta
Want kill rasta, but dem can't kill rasta
Do them try kill, but dem can't kill rasta
Empress Salassie, ay, and Queen Omega
Want kill rasta, can't kill rasta
Want kill rasta, but dem can't kill rasta
Do them try kill, but dem can't kill rasta
Bound carving knife of, now the Tride of Judah

[Makeba Mooncycle]
We're gonna tear Babylon down
Snatch the crown off the ruling clown
Tired of suffering, revolution bubbling
Screaming for years time for some action
Like the words on the screen, read the caption
The pussy man's conscience, hold me down
Bring the violence, by any means necessary
The holy war's legendary, the truth is so scary
Rasta never worries, is it just
That they fear me, that make the righteous leary
One of the chosen ones, walking under the sun
Where's my ultimate warrior, too much for common men
Ready to set it, whatever it takes to win
You the scariest queen alive, always underestimating
Sneak into your camp, destroy the designated
Targets of mod, my mouth spits fogs
Salassie, rasta man, I be down
My lion king sport your crown
Ready to infiltrate, let's see who's ready to die
I'm ready to elevate, already despised
Constantly tell my seeds, life's not fun
People don't care, but unity's number one
Bells I ring, the truth I sing
I got the love of Jah that keeps me high
Don't get caught up with this worldly wealth
Me and Lion Heart drop bombs like the stealth

[Hook 2X: Lion Heart]
Ah me eh no joke, when you offer me
Tell the man no bargain, and me no tell no energy
Don't tell none of the rest, I don't want naturally
Who don't want it, when me know the man go fe

[Chorus]</pre>
