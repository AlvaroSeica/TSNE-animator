Yo, Houston to Earth
Watch the ripper crucify you with verse
My urethra to ya uvula, quenches your thirst
Put your flames out with dry desert dirt where leopards lurk
Lock your soul down with an esoteric weapon search
Strap a bomb to one of your labels record clerks
And activate it as soon as they get to work
Ring the alarm, red alert, nigga it gets worse
Bypass security networks with select words
Megahertz make nebulas reverse till your head burst
Call the press first and ask them who got the best verse
Give me the respect I deserve
If you are what you eat, it's obvious I can't eat what I'm worth
Yall niggas eat pussy and burp
The other half of yall suck dick till your jaws and ya neck hurt
When you address me nigga end your sentence with sir
Critics went beszerk they aint even heard my best work
See I broke into the mind by
Quietly goin by their eardrum walls and hotwired they skulls
Yeah I earned the name Canibus, but what did it cost?
Battle rappers nothing but a serendipitous whore
Niggas probably like, what da fuck he dissin him for?
Yeah he dissed me first but you was never informed
I'm one of the top five nigga, my shit is tight nigga
you heard it right nigga, I rock mics nigga
But the limelight isn't where I belong
The top four don't even look in the mirror no more
If they did I'd be in the mirror looking back at em, ready to grab them
Kidnap them, and put them on my album
I rip jackers, Rip the time space fabric
Loop the future with the past tense looking for patterns
Eradicate Africans that sold Africans to Saxons
and forced black men to pay taxes
Attack a wack bitch with counter tactics
Split your bullet proof chases in half with a rapid gatling
Keep firing at cha till you trapped in
Now come back and scramble for helicopter extractions
While I'm back and forth back braggin
How I tortured them faggots and stabbed them with rip the jacker daggers
Slay dragons with old passages from black magic manuscripts
I found in the cabinet written in Arabic
Translate to characters one by one, like Arafat tarot cards suggest
I make terrorist threats through your stereo sets
Various anthrax carriers sendin serin to the press
At an imaginary address, Cani's the best
Untraceable, your pictures unpaintable, canvas thats wet
Let me dry you of wit some of this fire I spit
26 years old nigga look how I spit
A microphone fiend since I was like fourteen
My Cuban uncle used to sell cocaine, OK?
I'm reloaded, you fuckin wit the wrong emcee
Crudes felt your cold disease to the whole industry
Potent as Hennessey that was distilled in Tennessee
One shot scrambles your memory indefinitely
Nowadays a hundred bars aint impressive to me
You stepping to me nigga do it intelligently
You wanna battle or you wanna fuckin wrestle wit me
You aint better than me, you just got an obsession wit me
Canibus hybrid, the cake icing of rhyminingness
As I grow older I get colder like the declining
Climate of earth's environment, I'm entirely tireless
Rhymes come from my higherness of wireless dialect
Scientist on cyber speed design my specs
Astral project, therein height in secs, chakras connect
Doctors inspect what they can't possibly interpret yet
That's why they revert to threats
They curse and throw fits
They like immature earth cadets, looking like Captain Kirk in a dress
Lyrically I step on you, rip on you, then I defecate what I just digested on you
I'm better than you, I'm better than you, I'm better than you
Just to get the checkered flag I'll put the pressure on you
Put the extra effort on you
Write a motha fuckin letter to you and your editors too, threatin you
Detective check your mail and your messenger to
You can take this verbal slashin that I left as a clue
Execute the type of wickedness the devil approves
Which basically means I can do whatever witchu
I'm a rap music mutant, wit a cool name
Misconstrue fame but I spit butane
Blue flames out giant CO2 tanks
Demagnetize memory banks, enhanced, advanced
One of a kind like modern man's retina scan
Quick as a glance and flickers from kerosene lamps
What you want me to break first your jaw or your grill?
What type of spit you want from me sparkling or steel
Study law, yield draw up my own deals
So the longer they resist me the stronger I feel
Spread the ganglia from Tanzania to the flats of East Anglia
Give up, you cant keep up
The man eater in a wife beater
Spreadin Typhoid Fever through mic receivers with light reverb
Type in the right keywords, I might emerge
Takes a really nice nigga to excite these nerds
Niggas wanna see the gully in me, keep fuckin with me
Never under pressure, I keep the pressure under me
Bun?? Or weed, drop a freestyle on the internet then watch niggas burn the CD
Upload a picture of your mug getting DP'd
I'm one size away from 13, believe it she p'd
I'm the illest and its gonna be that way for eva
Word of mouth is good but a mouth of words is betta nigga
No body gets sicker than the ripper!!!!!!!!!</pre>
