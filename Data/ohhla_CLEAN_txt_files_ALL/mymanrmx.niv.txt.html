WOOF! I know you're out there trying to sabotage Mike's rep
I've been pimpin's and pimpin's and pimp pimpin' like Mike Epps
Baby powder when I come out with it!
Assistant pimp be backing me up (where my bitch, where my bitch at?)
Dine Wine Pimpin' Ken Player Prodigy eleven years master degree in COOCHIEOLOGY!
PIMP! too many don't leave female don't leave me
Somebody could say a bitch was looking for me HERE I GO!!

[Nivea] (Mystikal)
It was hard to find a brother that was down for me (here I go!)
So I'm telling everybody let him be
Cause, He's mine and I can't take no pigeons trying to take My baby
so I thought I had to let you know, find someone you can call your own
cause, now you're walking in a danger zone (DANGER!!)
And if I touch you I'll be wrong

[Chorus- 1 Nivea] (Mystikal)
Don't mess with My man (Sing Baby)
I'ma be The one to break it to you
Not My girls, not My man
So find your own and leave Mine alone
Don't mess with My man
I'ma be The one to break it to you
Here's a little advice for you, find your own man

[Jagged Edge] (Mystikal)
It was hard to find a girl that 's really down for Me (Uh Oh!)
Seems like alot of niggaz trying Me (Uh Oh)

So now you really better check yourself
Messin' with My girl is bad for your health and
So you know you will be dealt with
Better find you're own, oowwnnnnn girrrl!

[Chorus- 2 Jagged Edge] (Mystikal)

[Bridge- 1 Nivea]
Girl I'm warning you, Girl I'm warning you
If you wan't My man, If you wan't My man
I suggest you keep your hands to yourself

[Bridge- 2 Jagged Edge] (Mystikal)
Player I'm warning you (C'mon, C'mon, C'mon)
If you want My girl (Alright, Alright, Alright)
I suggest you keep your hands to yourself (C'mon, C'mon, C'mon)

[Mystikal]
Whenever you ready to scoop in the Coupe
Whenever you ready to ride Jag with no roof
Big truck 22's!
And if you don't like the second apartment we could move
Do whatever you wan't but don't fool with My boo!
You can't find me cause I'm inside
Lately I can't seem to stay outside of her!
We Can't stop talking on the phone, I let her jump My bones
Ooh she let Me see her model in a thong
But all of a sudden, life 's been changing!
You've been trying to dog Me, shine on Me, Walk over Me!
All this time you was being Phoney?
I was down for you down for dollar signs only
How could you do a brother that?
After all I do for you and yours this is how you pay me back?
Don't worry about the news, that's what I got My boo for, Fuck I need you for?
SING IT!

[Chorus- 1 Nivea] (Mystikal)
Don't mess with My man (Sing Baby)
I'ma be The one to break it to you
Not My girls, not My man
So find your own and leave Mine alone
Don't mess with My man
I'ma be The one to break it to you
Here's a little advice for you, find your own man

[Chorus- 2 Jagged Edge] (Mystikal)
