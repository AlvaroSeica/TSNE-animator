[Ke$ha] + (Diddy)
Wake up in the mornin feelin like P. Diddy (hey whattup girl?)
Grab my glasses I'm out the door I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth, with a bottle of Jack
Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't comin back
I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin up our phones, phones...
Droptoppin, playing our favorite CD's
Pullin up to the parties
Tryin to get a little bit tipsyyyyyyy

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight, 'til we see the sunlight
TiK ToK, on the clock, but the party don't stop no
Oh-whoa-uh-oh, oh-whoa-uh-oh!

[Ke$ha]
Ain't got a care in world but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket but I'm already here
And now the dudes are linin up, cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger
I'm talkin 'bout e'rybody gettin crunk, crunk
Boys tryin to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he gettin too drunk, drunk...
Now now we go until they kick us out, out
Or the po-lice shut us down, down
Po-lice shut us down, down - po-po shut us {DOWN}

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha]
DJ you build me up, you break me down
My heart it pounds, yeah you got me
With my hands up, you got me now
You got that sound, yeah you got me
DJ you build me up, you break me down
My heart it pounds, yeah you got me
With my hands up - put your hands up
Put your hands up (up up up up up up)
Now the party don't start 'til I walk in

[Chorus]

[Outro]
