[Intro: 60 Second Assassin]
It's already too late for situation
There's not enough Time situation man, ya know what I'm sayin'
It's already a do it right situation man
Time is runnin' the fuck out, man I mean
I can't even... my head is gone right now man
I don't know what to do man, only thing I say is S.O.M.

[60 Second Assassin]
Here in this second at Time
Evacuate the premises, here's another one
Nothing is heard but the audience and me givin' the drummer some
Relax in the place, here in the nick of time
Leave faces erased, kill with another mic, save
13 seconds already elapsed, perhaps
A mass murderer take the set with 45 seconds gap
A Betherley meek me freestyle is conspiracy
So King Ling sling, the rap Menace II Society
You actually have to step over mountain
Fork it with this babble abuse of New York's, an Apple
Come bite of this forbidden fruit
I Declare War as the sand begins to pore
With 28 seconds to fall, call the cops at city mall

*60 Sec' talking in the background*

[Chorus: 60 Second Assassin]
Time is runnin' out
It's true without a doubt

[60 Second Assassin *singing*]
Hey you, what you wanna do
Everybody get down to the 60 sound
This one's for everybody here, for you to see
War, stagnation, headin' for our nation
Lets bring our thoughts to unity

[Break: 60 Second Assassin]
Evreybody uptight tryna get their head right
Housing price is too high
Black community soon to die
Young ones here and there tryna get a nickel share
S.O.M., who will come with the master plan, S.O.M.

Chorus x2

[Break: 60 Second Assassin]
Know what I'm sayin'
Straight in the east side
Doin' our thing
Straight from the east side
Been doin' the east side

[Outro: Hell Razah (60 Seconds Assassin]
(Brilliant son, just heard that bangin' ass shit you just did son
"Doin' our thing") That was straight business
(Yo man right now, it's like where you comin' right now
We comin' on the farther level right now
Everybody gotta step their pen game up, aight
Go and re-write their albums and all of that
Cuz right now S.O.M. is about to lay something totally different
from everything that's out there right now)</pre>
