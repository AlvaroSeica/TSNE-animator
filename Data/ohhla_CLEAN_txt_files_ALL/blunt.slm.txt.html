First Verse [Pimp Daddy &amp; PxMxWx]:

[Pimp Daddy]

I bounce for the blunts cuz I ain't no hoe
Some niggas talkin' bout weed and don't even smoke
I light a fire bag that would make a nigga choke-a
And I can talk shit cuz I'm a real fuckin' smoker
Take a gun from a nigga tryin' to blow my brains out
Smoke comin' out my nose that's what I'm talkin' about
Two blunts, two coughs, two blunts again
I'm never turnin' down weed cuz I refuse to give in
Now white weed is good, and that E-Z wider paper
I wanna sample of it, so I can make some vapors
I'm about to roll cess and get real blowed,
Pass the bud to P-M-W, now I'll go for yours

[PxMxWx]

It ain't nothin' but a weed thang BABY
(Big man are ya buzzed?)
Yeah, MAYBE
One blunt, two blunt, three blunt, four blunt, five I'm gettin' real high
Leanin' to the side in my O-G stance, smokin' weed til' we die
It's another phat, phat track for a fat sack
My real chronic keep the clientele comin' back
Nickel bag of weed or a full sack of twenty,
Whatever you need the blunt man got plenty
A thick size spliff, honey dip with a tip
Pass the gin and juice so I can get me a hit
I gotta get full when I'm hangin' with my niggas
Lil Slim, Pimp Daddy, take your time and roll it bigger
I wanna blow smoke to them fools smokin' boil
A blunt is like candy you can call it Almond Joy
Cuz bite after bite is like light after light,
And when it's all done now you're full and now you feel right
Talk no shit cuz I know what'cha need,
Like we used to say, roll, roll, roll your weed
Twist it at the end, light it up and take a puff,
Smoke blunt after blunt until your ass get enough, yeah!

Chorus [Lil Slim &amp; Pimp Daddy]:

Blunt after blunt we smokin' blunt after blunt
We smokin' blunt we smokin' blunt after blunt
Blunt after blunt we smokin' blunt after blunt
We smokin' blunt we smokin' blunt after blunt

Second Verse [Lil Slim]:

Chillin' in the hooptie feelin' real high,
Smokin' fire weed and everything is alright
Blunt after blunt, nigga pass that weed,
I want the fire ass shit, with the fire ass seeds,
Now the shit is in my heart and the shit is all good,
Buck through my hood to get a fat wood
Now all the stores are closed but I ain't ready to sleep,
Went by my nigga Cold Beater's to get a bag of that weed,
Now my nigga was home, now it's time to get skunked,
I done smoked six blunts now you know I'm gone

Chorus

Third Verse [Lil Slim, Pimp Daddy]:

[Pimp Daddy]

I got the fever for the flavor 94 I'm here to blow,
Bounce the heffer out, so I can just roll
Don't be wantin' bullshit, nigga be wantin' real shit

[Lil Slim]

Talkin' shit about a bitch, no it ain't gone fit
Got my nigga Pimp Daddy I'm about to get blowed,
I'ma hit the bud once, MAN fuck them hoes!

[Pimp Daddy]

I know I like to talk shit about a dog ass trick,
But 94 I'm gettin' blowed with Lil Slim ya bitch!

[Lil Slim]

Fuck beatin' around the bush, I'ma get straight to it,
Blunt after blunt that's how them niggas on Eagle do it

[Pimp Daddy]

Do you see what I see?  Everybody smokin' weed,
Weed gets me higher so pass the blunt please

[Lil Slim]

Now twist me up one and pump up the sound,
Pimp Daddy, Lil Slim and we out fire down

Chorus

Yeah, uhh
Lil Slim, PMW, Pimp Daddy, for the 94
Cash Money Records in the house fool, for the 94
For B-32, Suga Slim</pre>
