[Ke$ha]
I-I think you got, the best of me
You're sleeping, with the enemy
You left me, all all alone, alone, alone, alone
The beat drops, I'm solo/so-low
My heart stops, I already know
You left me all alone, alone, alone, alone

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of the mess you made me
You're never gonna catch me cry (oh-whoah-ohh)
You must be blind if you can't see
you'll miss me 'til the day you die (oh-whoah-ohh)
Withooooout me, you're noooooothing (oh-whoah-ohh)
You must be blind if you can't see
you'll miss me 'til the day you die
(Oh-whoah)

[Ke$ha]
I've let go, finally over you
This drama, that you put me through
I'm better all all alone, alone, alone, alone
The beat drops, you're solo/so-low
It's last call, and it's gotten old
Now look who's all all alone, alone, alone, alone

[Chorus]

[Ke$ha]
I trusted you, you were the first
Then you lied, and it gets worse
You broke me down; now, just look around
Who's all alone? .. Who's all alone now?
