1999
Beatnuts, dead prez

CHORUS:
Everytime I look around, I see so much drama goin down
Everytime I look around, I see so much fakeness goin down

[Stic.Man]
Why I'ma, be stingy when I can share
Why I'ma, be hateful if I could care
Why would I hate my own, and forsake my home
Why would I fuck around and get a jake my chrome
I wouldn't have to stick you if we all could eat
It wouldn't be no need for beef, dyin over streets
We don't even own anyway, you could get bucked off any day
We behind enemy lines, y'all still writin Henessy rhymes
While I'm tryin to get a good price for a nine
Feel like my life on the line
That's why a nigga be hype all the time
Ready for the revolution at the drop of a dime

[M1]
I got a duty to have security for my niggas
My duty to serve the beautiful black sisters
A duty tom stand wit anybody that's wit us
And fully criticize all bullshitters
There should be awards presented, to niggas who fight back
Like Panther jackets, or sisters who like gats
I'm a full blooded warrior, ready for change
Recognize any soldier that's doin the same
Because I love who I am, and that means everything to me
My life aint worth a damn unless I'm dealin with reality
When I look myself in the eyes it's just me
And I aint gotta tell nobody no lies I feel free
And I would rather deal with the truth than falsehood
Than bein fake with my people and claimin it's all good
You can't run away from yourself so that's useless
If your word is bond then you don't have to make excuses

CHORUS

[JuJu]
Yo as I sit and contemplate about the fate of my kids
If I die is the state gon snatch up my kids?
City life, no choice but to live by the knife
Put food on the table at whatever the price
My beautiful wife, all the time cookin precise
When there aint no meat, she bless me with the eggs and the rice
Never think twice, I love you for the rest of my life
That's why I taught you how to shoot when situations get trife
Save the children from the evil that we smell in the air
Used to bein happy, now the feelin is rare
I'ma soldier in the struggle just tryin to prepare
Cuz when the revolution comes it aint gon be fair

[Psycho Les]
Yo it's the Beatnuts, dead prez, we connect like Tetris
How we comin at the world on some Malcolm X shit
So turn it up, so we can drop these gems quick
If you on some bullshit, then nigga hit the exit
There's enough cash, grass, and ass here for you and me
You wanna be greedy, sayin fuck the community
Watch out cuz life's gonna change very soon you see
I really don't believe we could ever have unity
This shit is serious we all tryin to have a milli stash
But love life cuz that's all a nigga really has
Love your fam, cuz that's all you really have
And handle your biz and stop bein a silly ass
Ayo it's gettin, gettin, it's gettin, gettin it's gettin kinda hectic
Slugs burn, so naturally thugs learn to stay vested
You need to learn a Psycho Les-son
And treat others the same way you wanna be respected, because...

CHORUS

Live together
Feed each other (feed each other)
Die together (die together)
Love each other (love each other)
Eat together (eat together)
Show each other (show each other)
Fight together (fight together)
Know each other (know each other)
(*2X*)

CHORUS

[Scratching]
Bring the power back to the streets, where the people live
Bring the power back to the streets, where the people live

Brother, brother, there's too many of you dying
War is not the answer
Too many mothers crying, oh this is a revolution, yeah yeah yeah
