[ VERSE 1: MC Twist ]
Check it out
I'm hip-hop's EF Hutton cause all the people listen
Flash is steady cuttin while I'm straight dissin
You see, it all starts when I step on stage
And pull a freak out the crowd that will engage
In a freak show on the dance floor
I don't claim to be hardcore
But the way I write is the way I feel
Not a styler but I'm makin that dollar bill
I love to rant and rave cause that's the way I behave
While freaks throw kisses, throw panties and wave
Intimidatin by the words I speak
And it's on the strength so it can't be weak
It's strong, never long, my words are brief
And the crowd's a tribe and I'm the head chief
Forever dictated by the way I rhyme
So all you suckers (better luck next time)

Yo Flash, it's on the strength, boy, so cut it up
(Hit it)

[ VERSE 2: MC Twist ]
It's kinda like Monopoly, I'm the wealthiest player
Cold crushin filthy rhyme sayer
With all the moves to keep me in the game
Makin record after record, buildin up my fame
With the mic that I like I can't do no harm
Doesn't kill or do damage like a firearm
It's just a tool that I use to school
Just like a queue stick when I'm shootin pool
You talk a lotta trash you will get floored
Like a piece get jumped on a checkerboard
Meet your inner dark alley, I make you fall
Like you're a pin and I'm a bowling ball
So enemies freeze, I don't intend to budge
Never goes away talkin 'bout my grudge
So to those who fall victim to my rhyme
All I gotta say (better luck next time)

Yo Flash, we still rockin em, so do it again
(Hit it)

[ VERSE 3: MC Twist ]
You know I max hard in Cali checkin out the East
Where the West Coast sounds are heard the least
Promotin my single, no need to hope
Cause I know it's gonna hit and the beat is dope
I'm gettin stronger the longer I spit these rhymes
I'm makin hella more cents [/sense] than nickels and dimes
Words bein joined without weak points
Hookin up to one another like skeleton joints
If a line gets heard after bein bit
I'm in the fast like I'm usin a first aid kit
Then I find the sucker who did me wrong
Take him out quick and repossess the song
Cause my name is Twist and that's the name it's done
So all jokes aside, eliminate the fun
Read my lips correct when I end this rhyme
Cause all I gotta say (better luck next time)</pre>
