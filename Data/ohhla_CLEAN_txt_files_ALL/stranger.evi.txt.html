[Evidence]
If it's one thing I learned that I written down on paper
It's never leave some weed on the table with a stranger
Shit, I can barely even trust my friends
Maybe with my lady, not the trees and the men
I mean really, why even should I even try to test this ocean? (Why bother?)
Catch him in the act and end up havin to approach him
Entertain the story while it's testin all my patients
Why the fuck you think I spent this money on surveillance?
While I'm on the other side of earth with that assistance
Pitchin in the night, saying Evi' goes the distance
At home, the same shit is goin on, I don't miss it
It's a nice place to live, but I wouldn't wanna visit
Never steppin out the car and run the stage without a purpose
Ghost-ride the whip like I'm ghostwritin verses
Afraid to come and go so I take fame in little doses
Director of these photos so the aim remains focuses
(Hold still, right there, hold still..) {*camera clicks*}
("FREEZE!")

[Chorus: DJ Revolution cuts and scratches]
"Some bust through the clouds, the pen push to write across"
