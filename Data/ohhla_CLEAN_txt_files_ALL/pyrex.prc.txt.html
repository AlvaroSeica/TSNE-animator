"Pyrex, I'm microwavin the whisk
 You probably think I'm bakin cake, when I'm workin the whip
 You probably think it's Pyrex"

[Sean Price]
UHH, whole lot of shots followed
After I bust your snotbox with the Ciroc bottle
Shoot the fair one, mano-a-mano the clown
I'll pull the pound on a Ronald McDonald
You a Happy Meal nigga with the toy in the box
I clap the steel nigga, put your boy in the box
P! And the gun that slap ya
I'm lyin, just like the rest of you dumb-ass rappers
The bomb flesh, most of y'all niggaz can't test
Besides Tek, most of y'all niggaz can't dress
Nike galore - right on the floor
Copped twenty pair with Vinnie one time on tour
Listen! Love is love, clap the gat at y'all haters
The CEO of your label is a basketball player
That mean your shit is never comin out
Sean Price, I'm forever dumbin out, Pyrex

Wake up, all of that crack in the street talk
It's made up like Jack and the Beanstalk
When I talk, the streets listen
When you talk, the streets dissin
... I don't even like you
... I don't even wanna fight you
... You stay the fuck away
for such and such, from such and such, come buck and spray
(Pyrex) Don't make me abuse my power
One telephone call, shoot this coward
I was the bum, but the pendulum switched
Now my whole team +Supreme+ no Kenneth McGriff
Y'all niggaz is fiends, steamed tilapia
Ving Rhames in the bing slappin ya, animal
Different beast on my fuckin sweater, Grranimal
Half monkey, half man; the +Manimal+ - P!
Heatmiser in disguise, surprise beat fire
Scrunch up your face and break wires, motherfucker!
