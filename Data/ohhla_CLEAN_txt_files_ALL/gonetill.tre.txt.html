[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
Gotta give it to you however you want
Turn around let me get up on it
The club bout to close so shorty
Let's roll but you know I'll be gone in the morning

[Young Buck]
Hey shorty what you drinking on, last call for alcohol
been thinking bout dat ass since I seen you at the mall
them thick thighs, pretty eyes caught me by surprise
didn't I meet you before last time I was high
I got my gators on it's 3 o'clock and the haters gone
so tell the dj to play my song
before I leave you know what I need is a independent bitch
that can pay her own bills and help a nigga get rich
where them baby momma's that hate they baby daddy
you wanna get him back then come give me them panties
yeah you probably rode in the Escalade sittin on 24's
but you never seen one with the Lamborghini do's
I'm in your city baby show me what I been missin
take you back to the room doggy style the position
and I'ma leave my number on the dresser if you want it
my plane leave at 9 so I'm gone in the morning

[Chorus]

[Young Buck]
You rubbin on my bulletproof vest while we two steppin
you never seen a thug in club with his weapon
I like it when you slow it down let me see what I'm workin with
the room all cloudy cause we smokin dat purple shit
the night still young shorty make up your mind
you with boss baby there will be no waitin line
come let this dirty south nigga talk dirty to you
put you in this old school like I'm 30 to you
don't pay attention to this so called beef that I got
you know how rappers is always wantin to be on top
'fatuated with the way you lick your lips
and the way you move your hips when you make that ass dip
don't you stop girl this is our world, just the two of us
feels like we got hydraulics tour bus
I'm a keep it real I love to hear scream when we bonin
but I gotta moving baby girl I'm gone in the morning

[Trey Songz]
The club bout to close
Lil momma get you out those clothes
I wanna (I wanna) make your body scream
to hear you moanin (ohhhh)
but don't forget that I'll be gone in the morning (I'm gone)
Big blades outside on chevy (big blades)
Shorty you wanna ride I'm ready (do you wanna ride)
We can get high while we bonin
but don't forget that I'll be gone in the morning

[Bridge]
Baby look in my face (don't you be scared)
baby don't wait to late to leave together
the time just right turn off your phone
baby let's be alone it will be just like you dreamed
if you know what I mean
baby girl I'm gone in the morn' (and the club bout to close)

The club bout to close lil momma (so what you gonna do)
get you out those clothes I wanna (yes I do)
make your body scream to hear you moanin (hear you moan)
but don't forget that I'll be gone in the morning
Big blades outside on chevy (big blades up on the Chevy)
shorty you wanna ride I'm ready (tell me if you ready)
we can get high while we bonin (high while we bone)
but don't forget that I'll be gone in the morning
(I'll be gone in the morn')

Baby I'm gone in the morn'
I said I'm gone in the morn'
my flight leaves at 9 so gone in behind</pre>
