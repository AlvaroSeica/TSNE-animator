[Intro]
Ha, yeah, hmmmm, come on, yeah, ha, yeah

I'm gonna keep it real
How you make me feel
Boy you give me chills, baby
I'm gonna break it down
You just drive me wild
Whenever you're around

1 - 	You know how I do
	And you know how I flow
	Can I get your name and number
	Cuz I like your steelo
	And I dig the way you move
	And the way you do your thing
	Baby you can bring it on
	You can swing it this way

Boy it's something about you
That make me tell my friends
But they don't understand, no, no
They don't know your style
With your high profile
The fliest thing in town

Repeat 1

2 - 	You stay on my mind
	Think about you all the time
	Got to get to know you well
	If you kiss then I won't tell

Repeat 2

Kiss me, oh, hold me
I say squeeze me, oh  squeeze me, whoa
Kiss me, oh, hold me
I say squeeze me, whoa, kiss me

[Missy]
(Ha ha, ha)
One two, check it, check it, check it out
Follow, follow me, many, many, many miles
One two, check it out
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme break you down
(Ha, ha, ha) 
One two, check it out
Follow, follow me, many, many, many miles
(Ha, ha, ha) 
One two break it down
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme, break you down

This track is nasty like pornography
Work the mommy I like Joe but he sloppy, dag
Poppy got a brand new bag, for real
I taking 'Quel O'neil like shaq, shak
Ask Michael Jackson who bad
He says I am but the queen not drag, dag
I'm bad enough to let my pants sag
I be in 'Vegas where 702 be at
Check it out

Repeat 1
Ad lib until fade</pre>
