[Josephine XV]
Remember when I ran away
And you got on your knees
And begged me not to leave
Because you'd go berserk?
WELL

You thought you had me fooled
But I just left you anyhow
Because I knew you were
Already out of your mind!
AND

I'm happy they took you away, Ha-haa! 
	{* Sirens sound and pitch of voice gradually gets higher *}
I'm happy they took you away 
Ho-ho, hee-hee, ha-ha
To the funny farm
Where life's hysterical all the time
And you'll be sorry I sent
Those nice, young men
In their clean, white coats
And I'm happy they took you away
HA-HAAA!

{* Normal voice *}
I thought that you were nuts
And so I laughed
I laughed when you had said
That losing me would make you flip your lid
RIGHT

It's true, I laughed, you heared me laugh
I laughed, I laughed and laughed
And then I left
Because I know you're utterly mad
AND

I'm happy they took you away, Ha-haa! 
	{* Sirens sound and pitch of voice gradually gets higher *}
I'm happy they took you away 
Ho-ho, hee-hee, ha-ha
To the happy home
With tree and flowers and chirping birds
And basket weavers who sit and smile
And twiddle their thumbs and toes
And I'm happy they took you away 
HA-HAAA!

{* Normal voice *}
You burned my food
You wrecked my house
And this is how I've paid you back
For all your cruel, unloving selfish deeds!
MEH

They've got you now
And you'll get just
What you deserve
For calling me a mutt, you mangy man!
{* dog barks four times *}
AND

I'm happy they took you away, Ha-haa! 
	{* Sirens sound and pitch of voice gradually gets higher *}
I'm happy they took you away
Ho-ho, hee-hee, ha-ha
To the funny farm
Where life's hysterical all the time
And you'll be sorry I sent
Those nice, young men
In their clean, white coats
And I'm happy they took you away
HA-HAAA!

To the happy home
With trees and flowers and chirping birds
And basket weavers who sit and smile
And twiddle their thumbs and toes
And I'm happy they took you away
HA-HAAAAAAAAA!

To the funny farm {* track starts to fade *}
Where life's hysterical all the time
And you'll be sorry I sent
Those nice, young men
In their clean white coats
And I'm happy they took you away
HA-HAAA!
