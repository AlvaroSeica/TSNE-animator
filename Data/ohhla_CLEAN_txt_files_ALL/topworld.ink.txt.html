Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah! come on
Uh, it feels like I'm
Sitting right on top of the world
Me and my blunt
Think I'ma jump
Don't need a parachute
I'm flyer then a bird
Said here I come
Man I'm so high
It feels like I'm sitting right
On top of the world
Think I'm bout to jump jump
Jump jump jump jump jump
It feels like I'm sitting right
On top of the world
Think I'm bout to jump jump
Jump jump jump jump
It feels like I'm sitting right
On top of the world
Yeah, I said the view up here is beautiful
Lookin' down, could barely see the flo
I'm killin' competition
I can tell they all worried
Cause I been on top of my game
Missionary
But the mission is
Get that money, don't trust no bitch
Cake nigga tell me what an icing is
What you waiting for
This shits...
And I ain't getting that stuff for nuttin'
Start to finish, keep on runnin'
Screamin' "Fuck the world"
And you can tell that hoe to keep on comin'
Keep on comin' I'ma fuck around and
De-bo something
Who da shit?
I can feel it in ma stomach
So sick, think I need a referral
Its just me and yo girl
It feels like I'm
Sitting right on top of the world
Me and my blunt
Think I'ma jump
Don't need a parachute
I'm flyer then a bird
Said here I come
Man I'm so high
It feels like I'm sitting right
On top of the world
Think I'm bout to jump jump
Jump jump jump jump jump
It feels like I'm sitting right
On top of the world
Think I'm bout to jump jump
Jump jump jump jump
It feels like I'm sitting right
On top of the world
Yeah, I know you hear me on the radio
See me in the video
Tell 'em I ain't sign no deal yet though
But I live that life they killin' for
Sky high wit a nigga ceillin' fo
Somewhere chilling wit a centerfold
Already known where we finna go
Up, up, up
Now just jump, jump, jump
When you hear that
Bump, bump, bump
I swear I just can't get enough
So I live it up, like its my last one
Light up and pass one
Hit it wit a passion
The future comin'
I'ma fuck around and cling on
Something
Told you I was gonna make it
I shoulda bet my money
But I get ma money
Never sweat ma money
It feels like I'm
Sitting right on top of the world
Me and my blunt
Think I'ma jump
Don't need a parachute
I'm flyer then a bird
Said here I come
Man I'm so high
It feels like I'm sitting right
On top of the world
Think I'm bout to jump jump
Jump jump jump jump jump
It feels like I'm sitting right
On top of the world
Think I'm bout to jump jump
Jump jump jump jump
It feels like I'm sitting right
On top of the world
Right on top of the world...
Right on top of the world...
Right on top of the world...
Right on top of the world...
I said its kid ink baby
