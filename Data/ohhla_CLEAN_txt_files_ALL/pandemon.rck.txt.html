3 passports, 3 first class tickets to the money
straight flights

[Rick Ross]
I live by the cold war
drove from round the globe
all I need is a kilo, a apron, show me the stove
general electric, perfected, cooking them O's
no more peanut butter sandwiches, now we looking at loaves
hoes, I need a condom for my toast, busting in these niggaz
standing flat footed, I'm on my toes
froze, pandemonium overdose
paparazzi in the trees, please curtains closed
Armadillo cigars, killers who like to play golf
preparing with transactions, with russian shots of the smirnoff
playing for keeps I buss in 'em 'fore she get off
I run the city just pull up and drop the kid off
welcome to organised crime
money got me excited, I'm coming four or five times
the '45 for you niggaz with 9 lives
Penthouse on college, money long as Ocean drive
black Chevy Tahoe's, Hatians up out the ?
my place spacious, smoking aces in Lagos
Feds get involved, I'm slipping off in the synagogue
issue you your warrant, informant, bitch I've been a boss
counting money stacks, your's counter-fitted
I made my money back, when your accountant didn't
went against the odds, its only one Rozay
my nigga OKAY

[Chorus]
I got a penny in my pocket
million in the trunk
started in the back, now we the niggaz in the front
step out on the block all the bitches they still in shock
get a piece of pussy then take my niggaz to shop
Pandemonium, causing pandemonium
half a million for the same car we rolling in
Pandemonium, pandemonium
we the number 1 niggaz your bitch notice it

[Meek Mill]
Million ways to make this money, you gon get it
on the grind 24/7 I'm with it
YSL swagger, wrist wear frigid
jumping out the Phantom like a muthafucking midget
money knocking at the front door I'm like "who is it?"
it's Benjy, tell my lil nigga "goin get it"
cause I've been counting all this dirty paper for a minute
Lamborghini dreaming thinking how I'm spend it
I'm like one's for the money, two's for the show of it
three's for the bitches that be fucking for the hoe of it
four for my niggaz that be stacking and then blowing it
you would think I had a curfew the way I'm going in
look at what we rolling in, causing pandemonium
papi got them keys in, he like my custodian
I was tryna bag a brick you was Nickelodeon
I was in them trenches getting down and dirty serving it
We's part the reason that them Churches got some services
the morgue could afford just cause we was doing murdering
nigga called my phone talking reckless I ain't heard of it
fuck ya girl, give her back I'm courteous
I can keep a secret with Vicky have a menage with Nicki
and be out London with Lauren and telling Megan Good morning
catch me rolling with Kelly or at the Hilton with Paris
from Hollywood to the hood, I want a mom and I swear that I want em all
wanna fuck em all
had my niggaz down so I'm screaming fuck the law
monday night wrestling, I'm so fucking raw
she gon wipe me down, I'm gon brush her off
I'm way harder than the concrete
I say what my mind speak
word to the homies Ross I can get that 9 Piece
for the low that 9 cheap
call me if you want it, haters see me
and I'm staying got 'em sick to they stomach

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Whole time, see that fly shit I've been on
all the girlfriends fall in line from my spin off
that's game bitch ain't shit
nudies? and some J six
where I'm from it's cold
and niggaz get at you like handkerchiefs
God bless you unless you was disrespectful
Bitches dissappoint you but money won't ever stress you
they say I'm special as Devin Hester on fourth down
so all that shit you niggaz kicking with worried about
catch me at tha carry out, mumbo sauce and half and half
flyest niggaz out here, period no maxi-pad
bitch I got a right to brag
bitch I got a right to boast
presidential suite and bitch
and I never use my right to vote
my vision enormous, my bitch's is gorgeous
and I am dead serious, bitch I spit with embalming
shout out to lil g, shout out Tre and Mohammad
that boa shit we get paid with death over dishonor
I'm known as Obama's don't I know no-one in congress
these bitches love me all the way, u got sorta's and kinda's
sort of remind you, why you don't call no vagina
lets give em awesome intercourse and ignore there inquires
quietly becoming a top ten
you dreamed of getting cream, best believe I'm John Deere
?, earth tones in the winter
Purp rolled in a rillow
I am on my John Lithgow
Out of this 3rd Rock, nigga it it out
I am on my Tom Brady y'all niggaz is Eric Crouch
what the bloodclot, Tommy Frazier fuck yourself
I can see your album coming
that shits like a sucker punch
here for breakfast, fuck for lunch
dinner time she bring a friend
write my shit so vicious
y'all are like snitches you can't see the pen
always on some new shit CNN
shittin on these niggaz like I need a pen

[Chorus]</pre>
