[Intro]
Grovvvve (Grovvve) Streeet...
FLOCKA!

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep poppin that's why the bad hoes jockin
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party {*2X*}
My partner on the pill, my other partner drunk
Rollin a lot, I'm tryin to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party {*2X*}

[Waka Flocka Flame]
I step in the club (there he go) rollin on that loud shit
My weed keep your security sayin be quiet
My breath is startin a riot, your girl's gettin excited
Hoes don't wanna try it; I'm like why not try it?
My swag they wanna buy it, my juice they wanna try it
Cl-club goin stupid, when I "O Let's Do It!"
Jewelry got her chewin, jukin and she movin
Grove Street villain, nigga who you killin?
Broke two years ago, now I'm worth a million
Jacksons to the ceiling, that's how we ballin
You know that I'm rollin, throwin up the mean bread
Now I'm 'bout to meet up in the club with the heater

[Chorus]

[Kebo Gotti]
HANH~?! Hanh?!
A party ain't a party, 'til I walked in it
Lime green flap matched the fitted and the linen
Gucci shades are on my face, and my lens kinda tinted
Cause my eyes real low, and my head just started spinnin
I'm rollin like a muh'fucker, I'm a roll out in this muh'fucker
I'ma +Roscoe Dash+ in it, I'm 'bout to show out in this muh'fucker
My jewelry game on frost, about to snow out in this muh'fucker
Ay Flocka get them burners, it's cold out in this muh'fucker
Ay muh'fucker~! What the hell is you jockin fo'?
Run up on me and my squad no that shouldn't be an option so
Somebody better let him know, I suggest that you let him know
This a Grove Street party, fake niggaz hit the exit do'

[Chorus]

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Rollin on them leaves, you can do the lean (lean!)
Blowing on that loud purp', pass that bobby brown back
The hood got my fuckin back, the streets I'm not duckin that
Please step the fuck back, Grove Street yes we are back
Hood plus I'm nigga rich, every ghetto feelin this
Twenty on my right wrist, thirty on my left wrist
Hundred on my neck, iced out for my respect
Twenty fuckin ten I'ma blow the whole check
In the club plexed (plexed) afterparty plexed (plexed)
You know how we ball (swish) all I know is ball (swish)
Every dollar in my pocket I'ma spend it all (Flocka)
When a nigga die they gon' say shorty raw

[Chorus]</pre>
