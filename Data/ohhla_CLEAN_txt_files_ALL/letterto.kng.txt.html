Song:   Letter to Dr. Dre
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Dear Dr. Dre
Was wondering if you'd ever sign a mexican..
That's right
You crazy

[Verse 1]
Imagine we could take it back
Just imagine when radio still played gangster rap
And rappers talked about being from the streets
True stories about the ghetto
Fuck the police
Imagine drake really being from a hood
Imagine if lil wayne was a real blood
Would he go to watts?
Or would he chill in compton?
With no bodyguards
Will anybody rob em?
Getting gangsta on a song
But you never killed
I know get tat'd up
You can say you're real
A bunch of mexican rappers with no deals
I pissed the fuck off
I gotta tell you how I feel
Fuck the dumb shit
I want a big deal
I'm talking bout them jay-z eminem deals
Making 10 mils
I want the best wheels
If this bitch don't fuck
Than the friend will

[Chorus: Big Swiisha]
I keep telling em
But they don't understand me
Can't you see
I'm coming from that west coast
Selling out shows
Grinding in the streets
It's all that I know
I keep telling em
But they don't understand me
Can't you see
I'm coming from that west coast
Selling out shows
Grinding in the streets
It's all that I know

[Verse 2]
Imagine it was based on race
And that's the reason why my demos
Got misplaced
If thats the case
Then imagine all latinos
Since it's about race
They never buy your ringtones
Never buy your albums
And never go to shows
Imagine there was no latinas in your videos
Imagine me at the mtv awards
Next to kanye laughing at a year ago
Imagine doctor dre saying "fuck the cops"
Rick ross use to be one
Now you give em props
The rap game is upside down
And now I'm writing letters to you
Trying to figure this out
Eazy-e fucked with mexicans
2pac mentioned us
I bet that in compton you lived next to us
So why the fuck can't we get in?
I got stories, gangs &amp; drug dealings

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Proud to be a muthafucking mexican
Los angeles mexican shit
Even though they tried
They won't be able to muthafucking stop us</pre>
