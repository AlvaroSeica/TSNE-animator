[Intro: Solomon Childs]
I'd like to introduce myself
I go by the name of S. Childs
Some of my friends call me Red Heroin, though

[Solomon Childs]
Hold the Koran in my arm, with a tech nine, rebellious
Like infliction, when it climbs
For this bread, I'm thinking all kinds of crime
Uptown niggas gave us the 411
Nigga in the Penal, you was a dancer
Singing on your gate like Keyshia
So you a hustler? Yeah, right nigga
We asked about you, now you home and you got war stories
Violate, splitting something that's mandatory
No games, this is hood shit for real
Let the bananas peel, let them feel what we feel
Let 'em feel their ribs touch, the Gods that left branded
With that 'throw-a-nigga-in-the-garbage' shit
Dick sucking lips, you and your baby moms'll catch one in the hip
Go head, dun.. brat!

[Chorus 2X: Yung Budd]
I know you see me rolling, or you see me riding
Then seen you peeping, then seen you hiding
And I caught you ratting, when you seen the squadron
Your jaws is yapping, mouth ready to start shit

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
Yo, this is killa shit, when it bleed into the club
The fight breaks out, and moves fast like a twisted
From corner to corner, you f' with my squad, you'se a goner
V.I.P. mode, Grey Goose, cuz I want ta
Kill in the shadows, don't disturb my key
See the jealous look in your eyes, you wanna fuck with me
But the Clef is un-fuck-wittable
Styles be unhospitable, your conditions is critical
I'm adding bitches to my list like it was MySpace
When I be letting off a sickle, beat your brain case
While you beating off and mated in the same place
I be like Rae in the club "nigga, just a little taste"
Tsst.. ya'll niggas make me laugh
When I closed down the Tunnel, wasn't that enough to feel my wrath?
And my gang, before million deep sword
Get tired, homey, make it easy on your self, and stay asleep

[Chorus]

[Yung Budd]
Can I get a toot-toot, beep-beep, hot beat, see me
Harlem, ain't see me, hit me on the bleep-bleep
I got the connects, I can't give no names
It's a family affair, like Mary J.
How fear he play, it's not a question
Won't settle for less, it's out of the question
You got my blessings, but I recommend you run to the books
For a order of protection, I done seen a lot since I touched down
I've done hit the block, with a brick, half sick when the cops round
Heard you pissed, type bitch when you crazed down
I flied over seas, half bent, when I touch down
So nigga act like I'm pussy, and I'mma gain
Have your whole fanbase screaming out "what's his name?"
On the radio, they like that 'what's-his-name'
Late great, in front of your REC name, you rep lame

[Shawn Wigs]
I got, bread in my pocket, I move like an eightball
Feds catch me, son, they pushing for that state law
Def, I "Chambermusik" like Clef
Gun in my right hand, but still be moving on your left
Bulletproof tef', my style bring sounds to deaf ears
Me and Trife Dies', been running with Ghost for years
This is T.U., 718's the identity
Legendary talk is like King and Kennedy

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
