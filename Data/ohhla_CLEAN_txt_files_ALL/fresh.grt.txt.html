Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling
Fresh
Fresh
Fresh
Fresh
Oww
I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling (fresh)

I feel a little bit
Fresh
And my fit look
Fresh
And my whip look
Fresh
And my kicks look
Fresh
I can make you say
Oww
I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling

[Bonafide]
Out the plastic with it no tags logos so gone and classic fitted levis and polos
They think I'm riding dirty because I'm whipping right
They see the dyness with me hommie thats a wife
Feeling something like a blessing in disguise
When you open up your eyes and your dream has come alive
Fine ride on my pivot others dressed up hard to fit it [?]
All I know is going hard get it off and get it get it (get it get it)
Motor city boys (fresh)
River city raised (fresh)
Coffee county roots
Music city paid
Trusting in the lord every time he give a day
Its the least that I can do cause he met me on my way
Said you got to be fresh (fresh)
If you want to be fresh (fresh)
And chose you before you hit the womb to be fresh (fresh)
Now I'm fine tune enter the room they say fresh
And I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling

(And I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling)
I feel a little bit
Fresh
And my fit look
Fresh
And my whip look
Fresh
And my kicks look
Fresh
I can make you say
Oww (I just like to look good, dont be mad at me, do not be mad)
I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling

I feel a lot bit
Fresh
My cologne smell
Fresh
And my fit look
Fresh
And my kicks look
Fresh
I can make you say
Oww (life goes on, sexy with a toothpick)
I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling

[Coffee]
These simple suckas think we lucky huh
So potent they turning yellow and floating
When we approaching we call em rubber ducky
The mirror image of you counterparts
Hope to saturate flood the market with your foolishness and drown the arts
Talking underhanded I dont understand it
Extraterrestrial looking at me like I'm from another planet
They scream like mike and janet
Hard to conceal and cover up hide it keep it quiet the raging hate thats leaking at it
Poisons the whole batch (oww)
Bake the bread from scratch
binyn to the mind (oww) realign I wrote the rhyme but theres a catch
who making sense of it
might be allowed to look the part
they rather sit and judge the art overlooking our heart
man its just too much to expound upon
too busy bringing sexy backward Justin busting is what my mind is on
letting the haters have it I'm advent what type of time I'm on
standing on a island of greatness whenever I'm alone and now I'm so
(and I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling) fresh

I feel a little bit
Fresh
And my whip look
Fresh
And my kicks look
Fresh
I can make you say
Oww
Teling all my people
I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling

I feel a lot bit
Fresh
My cologne smell
Fresh
And my fit look
Fresh
And my kicks look
Fresh
I can make you say
Oww
To everybody
I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling

[Bonafide]
Fresher then prince perm and will in the 80s
Like babies thats just born at the moment I'm the greatest
Got haters who test run and say that I'm overrated
So I leave em like xy shoot em a lil paper
Tell heaven forgive me cause I was more then they can take
And then I split it in half for em eating their little cake
Tell coffee go easy on em speaking the last eight
Broad the water with caffeine keep the haters away
Like

[Coffee]
Ya boy
Suffered my own death
The modern jones &amp; cater
Take a closer peak into the seekers that we suppose to keep
Cat got out a bag (yea)
Rumors swirl whirl cause we let it twirl
Covered uncovered destiny without a dad (huh)
When days open up (yea) (fresh)
And like the fetus start to eat us for son set treat us gangsta so we loking up (west coast)
Ghosting out by the ocean
We slow motion
Sip the potion
So fresh ya ashy in need of lotion
Cause we keep it so
Fresh
I'm looking so
Fresh
Look at me I'm so
Fresh
Dont be mad I'm sooooo
Fresh
Oww

And I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling
I feel a little bit
Fresh
And my fit look
Fresh
And my whip look
Fresh
And my kicks look
Fresh
I can make you say
Oww
I think I'm going out cause I'm feeling</pre>
