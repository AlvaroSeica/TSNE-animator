[Vast Aire]
Dueces Wild!
I'm calling the shots

You don't wanna wake up with a horse head at the end of your bed
That shit is pathetic
I'll just bite your face
You'll just stand there, holding your nose
Crying for anesthetic, you better step quick
The crew is LXG, and we are bout-it-bout-it
Kid, your mic should be off
If she's feeling me, her pants will be off
The ?cyclist sin is censurer?
But it's hard to resist the kama sutra
I treat emcees like Naomi
And hit 'em in the head with a Motorola
Just like I told you
With a sword in my hand I'm like a soldier
But this ain't no game, this ain't no scrimmage
Let us make man in our image

[Genesis]
Ayo, I am what was and shall be again
Full name is Genesis, now call me Gen
Foes call me enemy, now call me friend
My flow got White Supremacist tryna dark their skin
You couldn't call a better man, veteran
Who thinks that they can hang with me, let 'em in
But if you gonna bang a nigga, you better win
Cuz I'm like Predator, I want the competitor's skeleton
Still you'd be hard-press
Like a star dressed to approach his heartless nigga in the darkness
Regardless of your boys and their bulletproof vests
My back was against the wall, I fought best
And I forced dressings, inside the fortress
A solitude like Clark Kent in a dark bent
Spend nights like life can't be like this
Like Eddie Kane let it rain on nights like this
Knife pain, is he vain? NO! I'm just rich
Obnoxious bitch, mad cuz I got this dick
My glock is swift, just below is loading grips
The glow from the wrist that caused the sun so many clips
I'm a man of respect, kids nice, hand 'em a check
I get brains on the plane like Hannibal Lec'
And I can shoot like Rasheed Wallace, hand me a tec
They get too mechanical, now watch an animal wet

[Vast Aire]
This is some real hip-hop Holmes, you don't need Sherlock
You can keep your chicken noodle and your soda pop
I see you laughing now but it won't be funny when I spin your top
He tried to say I ain't fly
C'mon dude look at the space I occupy
Now that's like six feet
And when my wing spread you better watch my leap 
Thee Angelic, sort of like Michael
When we fight, you gon' get an eye full
That means we don't give slack
You better leave tomorrow and don't look back
Look at your face white like talcum
Because you saw the Phoenix millennium falcon
I want peace like the King but my actions are more like Malcolm
And you're asking how come?</pre>
