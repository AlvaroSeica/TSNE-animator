[Intro]
Meek ain't countin' money no more
If it ain't right, it ain't right
Zip the bag up
MMG
Drop it right there
[Background female voice]
Maybach music

[Verse 1]
I got these niggaz hating on me
But I don't give a fuck
Because they're bitches waiting on me
I'm just countin' all this money
And buyin' all these hammers
So when these niggaz play I let my shooters go bananas
Dollars flashin' like a camera
My whip sounds like a monster
My bitch got on that shit, she got a million dollar-sponsor
These niggaz gettin' sick
Somebody call a doctor
Cause all this blood's drippin' twenty racks on Louis Vuitton
I got Dolce and Gabanna
Gucci, Louis, Prada
Fly saddle, white socks, boy, I got a lotta
My dream cabanas
That's where they'll probably find us
Tell me now the jail like sayonara to you others

[Chorus]
I spoil them bitches
I employ them niggaz
Wipe my ass with the riches
Like they're some toilet tissue
Fuck with the winner
Minx in a winner
Philadelphia millionaire
Meek be that nigga
Your niggaz hatin'
My niggaz ballin'
Poppin' bands gettn' money buying them Magnum bottles
My bitch is patient
Your bitch is boring
Fuck her, that Friday night we both woke up this Sunday morning

[Verse 2]
Young nigga, lot of cash
Bad bitch, lotta ass
Lambourghini kinda fast
It got these haters kinda mad
Make me bring them sticks out
AKA, look, they're comin'
Them niggaz 're kinda nice
Which means that they kinda act
I be on all kinds of shit
Boy, I get all kinds of cash
Monday, I'm a wear my Jays
Tuesday, my Prada bag
Wednesday, I go Louie Vuitton
And say: How you been? I say: Doin' fine
But that ball hard like two Lebrons
I hit the booth with no shooting time

I'm Superman
My bitch is superfly
I make a hater wanna kill himself, suicide
That nigga play at me
He knows it's do-or-die
Cause I got a big Mac
And that bitch, be super-sized
Rollin with a hundred goons
Boy I got a hundred jewls
Bout to fuck a hundred hoes
All them bitches coming soon
Tell 'em I am coming now
Tell 'em I am coming, cool
Buy my shit, it's superhot
I named my album 'Summer June'

[Chorus]
I spoil them bitches
I employ them niggaz
Wipe my ass with the riches
Like they're some toilet tissue
Fuck with the winner
Minx in a winner
Philadelphia millionaire
Meek be that nigga
Your niggaz hatin'
My niggaz ballin'
Poppin' bands gettn' money buying them Magnum bottles
My bitch is patient
Your bitch is boring
Fuck her, that Friday night we both woke up this Sunday morning

[Verse 3]
Bugatti and Rosay
Bout to meet Jose
He said 'Did that work'
And I was like 'OK'
She said 'Give me money'
I was like 'No way'
She got mad and touched my phone
Said, 'It ain't no work if it ain't no pay'
I'm like 'Be gone, bitch
Be gone, bitch.'
I'll pop the guard
Turn on my On switch
Them bitches ain't on that
Nigga, cause they're on this
You put more money in
I put more money in

[Chorus]
I spoil them bitches
I employ them niggaz
Wipe my ass with the riches
Like they're some toilet tissue
Fuck with the winner
Minx in a winner
Philadelphia millionaire
Meek be that nigga
Your niggaz hatin'
My niggaz ballin'
Poppin' bands gettn' money buying them Magnum bottles
My bitch is patient
Your bitch is boring
Fuck her, that Friday night we both woke up this Sunday morning

[Background male voice]
Can I ask a favor?
Please embrace the fact that Meek is just that boy now
Why fight it?
You're doing yourself the service</pre>
