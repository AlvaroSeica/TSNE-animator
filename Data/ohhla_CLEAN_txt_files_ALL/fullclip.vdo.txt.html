Jumpsuit [?] fresh home, but focus
Hopeless, finding out ways to wear that coke ass
Told him smoke this, gave him that like hold this
Me and Le Brawn meet you at the mall for this road trip
In and out every bank hit, every route, make sure
Correct them out can't lie, check the account
For my dogs they need burners I gave them out
Broke some laws but beat the murders, I paid it out
Helped them out if you tough, why yelling shot
When they killed Ricky you turned in the tray, let him out
Gut the lock, set the film box, I set him out
Miss sugar hill posted in a Jag but mellowed out
When niggas show muscle they take advantage of it
Beef on with them they think you ain't gonna make the sandwich of it
Everything ain't a movie, make sure the camera's covered
Lift the Uzi before I [?]

If we ain't got it, we get it
You got it, let's get it
Who got him to get it
'Cause they got him they get it
Every shot that we sending
We hot or we winning
This ain't no bullshit, nigga
This the full clip
If we ain't got it, we get it
You got it, let's get it
Who got him to get it
'Cause they got him they get it
Every shot that we sending
We hot or we winning
This ain't no bullshit, nigga
This the full clip

We ain't got it, we get it
You ain't got it, we get it
If we got it this caddy, get in, lil momma, we livin'
Handing out exquisite whips while you hopping them relics
[?] hook this with the dent you've been popped for a minute
Dig it? You ain't never lived by the law of the streets
Lieutenant, what you ever did to record you a beat
The lyrics? The definition of talking is cheap
I live it, that's why you bitch keep my songs on repeat
Capisce? I'm in your party, give me ten feet
Before I pull off with your bobby in a Benz G
Your [?] know I'm hotter than the Benz seats
You couldn't lure me with a Martin Luther King speech
Sheesh, I got a fever with the lyrics, you can see it 'cause it's vivid
They believe it when I spit it, nigga
You niggas don't see it, I'm a menace
I used to hold the block, I can't see it in a minute

If we ain't got it, we get it
You got it, let's get it
Who got him to get it
'Cause they got him they get it
Every shot that we sending
We hot or we winning
This ain't no bullshit, nigga
This the full clip
If we ain't got it, we get it
You got it, let's get it
Who got him to get it
'Cause they got him they get it
Every shot that we sending
We hot or we winning
This ain't no bullshit, nigga
This the full clip

You ain't 'bout it to live it
You a coward, forget it
Talking powder, I'm with it
Hand me a pot in the kitchen
Haters probably bitching
Yeah, they probably pitching
Drag it down, nigga, go find a brick
Lying down for ringing, I ain't loud
I gotta bang I'm like Johnny Yang from Chinatown
I 'bout to bling like I gotta drink to quiet down
I'm at the same, different kind of mint, that's lighter brown
I'm known to test shoot, 38 hold the special
Live like a Soprano, no listen like Tony nephew
[?] 12 joints, there's four left, more or less
I'm posting the [?] and go text
Thinking the L, fly nigga for real
Sick of being your average why nigga was ill
Quicker with the ratchet, never mind the still
I'm going for your wife so I got time to kill

If we ain't got it, we get it
You got it, let's get it
Who got him to get it
'Cause they got him they get it
Every shot that we sending
We hot or we winning
This ain't no bullshit, nigga
This the full clip
If we ain't got it, we get it
You got it, let's get it
Who got him to get it
'Cause they got him they get it
Every shot that we sending
We hot or we winning
This ain't no bullshit, nigga
