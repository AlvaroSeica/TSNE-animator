Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Real shit, to all my loved ones in the cemetery
I'm a live it up down here
'Til I meet you at the crossroads up there

[Chorus]
For our loved ones dead and gone
Turn it up, turn it up
Feel what I feel when you hear this song
Turn it up, turn it up
Praise God
I seen another day
'Cause Lord knows
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
I praise God
I seen another day
Could've went the other way

[Verse]
COB is my religion, what do you believe in
I believe in divine intervention
I'm lucky to be breathing
Gun shots loud out of nowhere
Shooter tried to put me under cement
God intervene, luckly he seen it
Guess that right there wasn't in the agreement
Life is cold, I've seen it change niggas
I don't blame, when I hang with a
Thousand fucking gang members
Put you in shovel trouble
My pistol's grave digger
Sipping that liquor prescribing it like
It was vike and call it painkillers
Drinking, driving, swerving high on
I'm thinking, crying, surging, fine
I'm sinking I am hurting why are
All of my people dying
Why must you leave real niggaz die
While busters breathe
Where's the justice, just the other day
I was thinking 'bout
One of my dead homies and
I felt something touch my sleeve
Maybe I just believe
Maybe it was just a breeze
As these hours pass
While I still got time in my hourglass

[Chorus]
I praise God
I seen another day
'Cause Lord knows
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
Could've went the other way
I praise God
I seen another day
Could've went the other way
For our loved ones dead and gone
Turn it up, turn it up
Feel what I feel when you hear this song
Turn it up, turn it up
I praise God
I praise God

[Outro]
Yeah
Reviving out man
Crooked I, psalm 82 6
Shout to the whole slaughter house team
We the LA Lakers
Dj sour milk, just incredible
La Lakers dot com
I praise God
So what's the morale to the million dollar story
It ain't about money, it's more about making something out of nothing
And if you can draw inspiration from that
That's your millions dollars, shit
That's even more than a million dollars</pre>
