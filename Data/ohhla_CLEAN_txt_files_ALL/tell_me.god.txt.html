Tell me, Tell me, Tell me, Why?
Tell me Whyyy?, Tell me Why? Tell me Why?
Tell me Whyyy? Tell me

I sit back like a recliner and wonder if you my girl
Who'se faithful while I find ya when your breath smell like vagina
Why you acting fishy when you walk in the room?
And you smelling like an unfamiliar form of perfume
Hair messed up, your body dressed up for seducing
Talking late at night, on the phone with Susan
At first I thought it was amusing how you two would flirt
Fuck around, simple kiss now its kisses up the skirt
Im shocked, I really thought I had you locked for a while
I didn't know you were into go-girl style
Melissa Evans you be proud that you're smellin like Helen
But I'm 'bout to bust your mellon cause you're not honest for telling me
How the fuck I'm s'posed to guess? Mental telepathy?
Is it fascination? Or you ain't pleased sexually?
You gotta tell me something stop fucking around
Tell me that you're leaving me, or tell me, how can I be down,?

Tell me Why? Tell me Why?
Tell me Why? Tell me Why?
Tell me Whyyyy? Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Tell me Why? Tell me Whyyy?,
Tell me Why? Tell me Why?
Tell me Why? Tell meee, Ooh Baby

Body female, send messages like E-Mails
That are hard to read like if the frequency fails
Is it my fault that I can't read your thoughts about life
How am I supposed to know who you were with last night?
I got things on my mind that I wanna say to you
Don't ever let me find out you ain't been true
I try to treat her right, and plus I always respect her
But she's the type that tends to fall for men who neglect her
Just wanna sex her? The answer could be maybe
But I want more than that if the woman is a lady
It seems like lately, if you ain't the player you're the one who'se gettin played
Who made the world this way?
Why do things got to get complicated?
Why do some girls get me so damn aggitated?
It's amazing how much power you have - Because your blazing hot
But are you worth it all? I think not....

Tell me Why? Tell me Why?
Tell me Why? Tell me Why?
Tell me Whyyyy? Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Tell me Why? Tell me Whyyy?,
Tell me Why? Tell me Why?
Tell me Why? Tell meee, Ooh Baby

Why do ugly mutherfuckers always get the flyest honey's?
Why do people act different when they come across money?
Why are most humans judged by our monetary status?
Why the wack ass rappers get sweated by the masses?
Why must it be so hard to excell? and
Why does this earth seem to be mental hell? and
Why can I just bubble over like lava?
Why must we deal with this negative drama?
Dramatic - Chickenheads turn to crack addicts
Acting wack , automatic responses, I've had it
With your nonsence, I used to love her but she lost her Com Sense
Now I can read her like a book - With the table of contents
No hidden messages, I reminisce of when I kissed your lips inside your residence
An essence of ecstacy, Now you act like my enemy
Not a friend to me, I drown your memories in hennessey
And mentally paint the pictures of pain stained eyes
I cry, Why must you be so fly? And why must you make me feel like my soul dies?
These are the things that make me ask why...

Tell me Why? Tell me Why?
Tell me Why? Tell me Why?
Tell me Whyyyy? Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Tell me Why? Tell me Whyyy?,
Tell me Why? Tell me Why?
Tell me Why? Tell meee, Ooh Baby.</pre>
