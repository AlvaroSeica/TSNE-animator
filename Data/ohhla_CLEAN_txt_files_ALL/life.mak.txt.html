[Chorus 2X: Makeba Mooncycle]
What's the meaning of life to you (what's going on out there?)
All the people that died for you (what's going on in here?)
Sacrificed and pull you through (what's going round here?)
What's the meaning of life, life, life?

[Makeba Mooncycle]
I can't bore you with the same mental slavery, preach ya teach
Because that shit didn't save me
I'm just vibing, chilling like the next man
Trying to eat and do the best that I can
On my own for a long time, I been around and seen alot in a short time
But people grimey, asking sometimey
Acting like they don't know, where to find me
So what the hell I do my own thing, anyway
Stay on my own path, won't get in your way
I got my own shine, plus my own rhymes
And I gets buckwild, with my own style
Don't test the vocalist, get your mic pressed
Lay around and test, leave the place wet
If you need my help, you know where to find me
Queens to Brooklyn, you love the climate

[Chorus 2X]

[Makeba Mooncyle]
So what you think? Life is a game
Always reminded and sometimes get stained
To ourself, yes, we're empty inside
Bet the streets can't wait to override
You giving out crazy, it's just more to bear
They're more aware, they get intense with the stare
A bloodline is thickening, from all the blood trickling
I shoot the fair one, in the club or in the streets
I never give beef, cuz I, walk descrete
I carry myself, so people don't erect me
They secretly protest me, better than the best be
Some people say, Makeba has no feelings
Always with the kids, and up to dirty dealings
But I hush the crowd like your honor
Retain information like your hand palmer
I'm the one whose a partner, like

[Chorus 2X]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
What you giving, surely ain't taken
If it's me, you're mistaken, you'll get your life taken
Never live to nothing, cuz I don't know nothing
Seen a, whole lot of something, but I ain't saying nothing
Set off any crowd like a, chain reaction
While you stacking, I be packing while others fall slacking
More money, more murder, more problems, but the brothers had to rob him
Like Don King, I'm living the American dream
The never ending quest, to stack mad cream
Surviving any climate, violent or non violent
But you got the right to remain silent
I'd rather be a tyrant, or rocking MC's
Constantly, every microphone's dream
Roll with a tight team, that know the meaning of cream
Got love for the babies, and the thugs acting crazy

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
