I'm dizzy walkin outta larry's army wear used
with some black leather shoes and desert BDU's
many boxes of ammo, I got the camo face paint
barricaded the tower doors, safe this place ain't
up to the top, I can see the whole planet it would seem
the sun is beatin on my head as I'm livin my horror dream
up-chucked a couple times then I finally took aim
a man is chattin on his cell phone, I spattered his brain
a lovely couple started runnin, all the sudden she tripped
he kept right the fuck without her, like he never missed a step
I snapped one to his head, he fell dead to his knees
then his wife was right there to retrieve the car keys
not many notice at first, although some do start to scatter
pluggin iron in they back, who they are it doesn't matter
there's a psychopathic, way up in the tower somewhere
and when they think they outta range *gunshot* poof they hair

[Chorus]
and it was hot that day (someone's in the tower)
so fuckin hot (shooting from the tower)
and it was hot that day (someone's in the tower)
so fuckin hot...

I shot the lady in the ass and the kid on the grass
and the daddy on the swing through the lens in his glasses
first cop on the scene will be commended for his services
for now he holds his throat and scream "i didn't deserve this"
the tower too high, I'm bringin shot from above
cuz my head's a battle royale of serpents, snails, and bugs
I'm quadarpolar, though my snipers scope I see the enemy
the world ain't never been my friend and never pretended to be
I fought in two wars, my country left me poor and sick
leg missin, agent orange and an un-useable dick
so as I reload, my trigger finger's frozen cold
from squeezing so hard my reason is no control
warped soul, look at that, pap-pap-krack
three frat college boys flat, dead on they back
and they lady tryin to hide behind the dead fat guy
just got one plucked in her eye

[Chorus]
and it was hot that day (someone's in the tower)
so fuckin hot (shooting from the tower)
and it was hot that day (someone's in the tower)
so fuckin hot...

I'm finally at war again, only I ain't takin orders
200 yards below, I'm taggin targets, small as quarters
marksman, sniper, military precision
spotlight on the tower, tryna nullify my vision
my eyeballs keep rollin in the back of my head
practicing for any minute when I'm actually dead
they put the tape up, these people think they outta my view
but still, I'm steady pluggin sleepin pills off into them too
I see in strobe light vision and I'm way beyond a panic
my only skill is murder and I'm stuck on automatic
sweatin profusely, bleedin outta my ears
their shots are missing by fragments, bullets shavin my hairs
and yet my aim is remarkable, I'm peggin these duck
one by one, jumpin out of those SWAT team trucks
I see the major activity, I'm caughing a chao
mad... my life went out with a flash

[Chorus]
and it was hot that day (someone's in the tower)
so fuckin hot (shooting from the tower)
and it was hot that day (someone's in the tower)
so fuckin hot...

and it was hot that day, so fuckin hot
it shouldn't get that hot, humid and hot
beatin down on us, so fuckin hot
too fuckin hot that day, just too fuckin hot
how can it get that hot, how can it be that hot?
too hot, too hot, too hot, it was just too fuckin hot</pre>
