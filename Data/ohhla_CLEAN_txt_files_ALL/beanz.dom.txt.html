[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino]
This is my rice and beans, The story of my life
That Mommy cooked to nourish me and make it all right
It was my hunger for the mic that gave a soldier his stripes
I'm shinnin like a strobe light, I don't believe in the hype

[Dom Pachino]
It's been a long road to perdition
Same soldiers, Same mission, Same vision, Same kitchen
I've been all around the world but still live in the same buildin
Had to destroy a couple dudes, But the God is still buildin
Yes Allah has children, I fathered a tribe
I'm put here for a reason, Almost buried alive
I arose from the dirt, What a surprise
But they thought I was weak and I wouldn't survive
I'm physically in great shape but it's my spirit inside
It's my eye of the tiger, I am ready to ride
Till the wheels fall off this bitch and I'm filthy rich
Monopolize like Milton Bradley, Kid I gladly did
P's so funny style why, Cause P's a leader
Make you eat some slugs from my millimeter
Knock you out the ball park like I'm Derek Jeter
I work like a slave to eat like a king
I'm at peace with myself cause I'm livin my dream
Cash rules everything around me, So I'm makin that cream
Aint nothin goin down without talkin to P
Matter fact, Aint nothin goin down without forkin them Gs

[Chorus 2X]

[Dom Pachino]
Through the mist of it all, I remain in the game
Had to re-event myself to re-establish my name
On the solo tip, Ayo, Who we rollin with
I don't know, All I know is that he, He controllin it
And they rollin thick, His pockets swollen sick like they caught a colon shit
O.C. for no reason, International, I hop on planes and start breezin
I rest in hotels like 4 seasons, My music rock your whole region
But I'm back with a vengeance, Thanks for your attendance
I'm a starter, Don't play the benches
Knock out artist, You niggas will own denchers
I build like an apprentice, To be a household name, Is the incentive
I'm one step away, I'm so inventive
To make some shit, You niggas can't forget, Your fuckin with the vet
You fuckin with the best, You rockin with Dom P, There's no contest
