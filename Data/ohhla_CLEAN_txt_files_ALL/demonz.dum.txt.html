[Chorus: Dungeon Masta]
My demons in the dark, my demons in the light
My demons do what we got to do, get this money all night

[Dungeon Masta]
Hustle in the dark, then we scatter like roaches when he hit the gat box
DT's approaching, what we do when by a bust
Still ain't got the guts, don't sell to those you don't trust
I guess ya'll niggas is not aware of the shit that ya facing
Hunt you and chop you like Jason
In this game we struggle, the cutthroats are out there
Watch where you step, plotting on your dough, we don't care
First opportunity, your ass will get got
And if you don't give it up, boy, your ass'll get shot
Your peoples will be shopping for you box, services are beautiful
Ain't no way in hell they viewing you
That what you get for flashing Benji's, pockets on empty
Started a frenzy, cuz she tempt me
One nigga down, just a few left
Won't rest, til I decide to give 'em freedom or death
Man, listen, insanity's sinking in
Guaranteed, I be, the last man blazing

[Chorus 2X]

[Dungeon Masta]
I don't know how it goes, king of the county, no one behind me
Can I outshine me, crossing all ground
Can you smell it? Ain't not telling what goes on
In the mind of mad men, just love to clap men
What's ya name? Dungeon Masta from the Beast Coast
Rock hoodies in the summertime, pack toast
Police done got away with murder, of innocence
Bystander, part to Guiliani plan
I hope your prostate take you to your wake
God don't like the ugly or the fake
You're according to eight, I got crates for the nines
To hit lions, and tigers, and pigs, oh my
Don't fuck with me, you'd rather pray to your mystery
Move another inch and your history
You cats can't see me, if you had vision like Clark Kent
Don't need they collard greens to get bent, see ya on the day of judgement

[Chorus 2X]

[Dungeon Masta]
Keep shit tight, and we handle our own beef, when shit's not right
Don't try to run or you'll get done off tonight
If he murder you tonight, we will bury you tonight
I was gonna let you live, but you done pissed me off again
You fucked up now, once I get hostile
So many victims, and very little time
Maintain my composure, release the vultures
I told ya, you can't escape my tortures
Rap tools and pop ya fools smoking Dutches
As much as you making, the law that I'm taking
Leap like a frog, like a door you get slammed, muthafucka
Listen, tired of this broke shit, bitch pass my clip
So I can go outside and start to flip
I feed off negativity, I got to be the best that I can be
And faking with creativity, can you feel the energy?

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
