(Tupac talking)

(Are you scared to die?)
Is reincarnation
(Are you afraid to die?)
Reach the whole nation
Me murderer?
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Uh

(Chorus x2: Tupac)

My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole Nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition be my prophecy I hope its heard

(Verse One: Tupac)

Hard words is spoken, many promises broken as if it's
Useless to hope, they got me constantly smoking
My role model was a cold bottle, of O.E.
Surrounded by my closest homies but nobody knows me
I pray to God it ain't easy
half the cops in California got a hard on to squeeze me
Running through the backstreets, hopping over fences trying to shake the
fucking K-9s, run around senseless
I'll probably be a mystery to many, but a legend to some
I've been a man for many women, but a husband for none
In case you see me out in traffic, looking nervous and high
My hands, holding my pistols will they serve us or die?
May God forgive me for my crooked ways, I didn't mean it
Knew I'd fall in love with money the first day that I seen it?
Maybe now they can understand, my occupation
It's clear that my only fear of death is reincarnation

(Chorus x2: Tupac)

(Verse Two: Hussein Fatal)

I keep my heater on safety
I've been shooting rock's lately
Everybody dies, they nickel plates don't penetrate me
I was suppose to be the murder first to go
Them niggas missed and raised my blicks and now it's personal
They done told me that I was slipping got his strap and started tripping
Slipped two clips on the table twist an L and said "Fatal listen"
Everybody don't be missing keep your vest on baby
And you know that shit can happen cause the Teflon crazy
You ain't gotta pack a gat I got your back just keep the frontline
Or you can solve that, go grab the Gat and get to gun shot
Be we locked down, don't have your back in the county
All he thought about was plastics and murdering bastards

(Chorus)</pre>
