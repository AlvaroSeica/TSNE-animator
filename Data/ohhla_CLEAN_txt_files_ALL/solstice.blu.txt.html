(Talking)
I was reading "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific" last night
what is his critique of agnostics, I'm not really understanding it

[Verse 1: Geologic]
We labored and debated while you waited for sabbatical
Down to rock your body as we turn the party radical
I can see the game like the blind feel the pain
Both sides colliding with the concrete in vain
The pacific northwest take the spotlight now
My people pump your fist like your Manny Pacquiao
Man-child with wild style right to be hostile
Folks feeling like a rottweiler in a dog pound
Forward in this generation triumphantly
Even wack sound-boy's speakers couldn't muffle me
Its up to me and Sabzi to bring back the quality beats
To rock the audience
I seek the knowledge that your colleges lack
While we always used to come late and sit at the back
And crack jokes instead of taking notes
I wrote this line after line
After school hit play, press rewind

[Hook]
The Blue Scholars in the place to be
We got one DJ and one MC, and that's it (that's it)
That's it (that's it)
Come on put your hands up if you're feeling that shit
The Blue Scholars in the place to be
We got one DJ and one MC, and that's it (that's it)
That's it (that's it) that's it (keep them up yall)

[Verse 2: Geologic]
On the eve of the solstice I wrote this
Focused on a singular purpose
To get rid of the curses, that afflict us
We live what you only see in pictures
The biggest hypocrites usually quote the most scriptures
But my approach is a diligent task
And rocking shows pro-bono is a thing of the past
Dr. King said "Freedom at last"
And some have interpreted that
To mean that we have come to the end of the path
But instead the long march hasn't even begun y'all
Political power manifest once our guns drawn
I write like shit will pop off with one song
Watch what I'm feeding my seed
And keep my son strong
And on and on the anonymous work
And an honest compensation is all they ask in return
It's the passion that burns within, let's begin
My philosophy to win is calling me to spit this shit

[Hook]
Blue Scholars in the place to be
We got one DJ and one MC, and that's it (that's it)
That's it (that's it)
Come on and put your hands up if you're feeling that shit
Blue Scholars in the place to be
We got one DJ and one MC, and that's it (that's it)
That's it (come on yall)
Clap your hands everybody, everybody clap your hands</pre>
