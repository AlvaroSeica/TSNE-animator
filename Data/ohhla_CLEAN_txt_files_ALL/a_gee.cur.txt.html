Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh
Yea
Fool
And you cant do a thing
About it
Bitches know the planes
Got it
Yea
You want to live in a house
Don't want grass to grow
Your homeboys lookin' bad
And you givin' cash to them hoes
Old sucka ass nigga
Fuck you round here for?
Fittna' take off on them cluckers
Man cabin door flow, cold
O'z rolled up
Fuck it we can get some more
Kinda (cotton) had to stop at the 24 hour store
Drop them bomb ass case v8
Crate drop top
Sun ain't even out
But I can't wait
For the rain to stop
Shine rather or not
You wanna' deal with it
The bitch in your car
Wanna' hear us
Live what?
Jets
Year one vets
From the cars to the broads
Motherfucker be my guest

Yea
A gee is what I am
A jet is who I be
You know what I smoke
And you cant see me
Know matter where you go
One place we'll never be
Is close
Even if you move right next to me

A gee is what I am
A jet is who I be
You know what I smoke
And you cant see me
Know matter where you go
One place we'll never be
Is close
Even if you move right next to me
Bro

Uh yea
On a mission

And I'm fishin'
For my nigga ski beatz
Quote live nigga rap
Broke a jive nigga back
Spineless
Spliff cruising with optimus primeless
And in the primers
In inclined to sound better
Then other rhymers
Don't bring them fools around him
He'll make them look clownish
Countach Lambo
Shoot like ammo
Through traffic with green trees
I (blink, dead) like camo
Flyest
Gosh oh my
Where was I
When things got hot?
Somewhere cool
Laughing at you
Fuck rolling one
Roll two
Roll three
Loop the beat
And light an incense in the booth
Yea

Yea
And you cant see me
No matter where you go
One place you'll never be
Is close
Even if you move right next to me bro

A gee is what I am
A jet is who I be
You know what I smoke
And you cant see me
Know matter where you go
One place you'll never be
Is close
Even if you move right next to me bro

Yea
And you can't do a thing about it
And that ain't gunna change I'm sorry
And bitches know the planes got it
And you can't do a thing about it
And bitches know the planes got it
And that ain't gunna change I'm sorry
Yea</pre>
