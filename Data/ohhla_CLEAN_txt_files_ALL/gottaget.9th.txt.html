Typed by: Tha Masta

[9th Prince]
Yeah, aiyo...
I'm like a timebomb waiting to explode
Any time I Bust-a Rhyme, I push shit in Flipmode
Fresh out the belly of the beast I rose
And made every rapper in the hip-hop world fold
The game is to be sold, I was told
Whether young or old, gotta get that gold
The Grandaddy Flow, yeah, I'm on the stroll
My niggaz locked down coming home on parole
We gotta stay bold, shorty in the party
Yeah, no doubt, I like the way she moves her body
She's a hotty, drunk off Bacardi
I slithered to the back and yo the bitch tried to rob me
True story, you've now entered in a warzone territory
Let niggaz scream glory
But the truth is, y'all niggaz straight bore me
Word up, aiyo, y'all niggaz straight bore me

[Chorus 2X: 9th Prince]
Aiyo, I was raised by The RZA
Ghostface will always be my brother
My older cousin's name is GZA
Rest in peace to my second cousin O.D.B.
Aiyo, we gotta get this money

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, fiberglass niggaz is easy to break
You'se a snake, and you move like Jake
I'm like Saddam, extorting oil from Kuwait
Before the U.S. got involved, there's no problem I can't solve
My mind evolved, almost broke the steel, but now it's locked up behind bars
I've been to jail and came home with no scars
Only with protection from Allah
The Humis scorcherer, rhyme enforcer, Explorer like Dora
Kiss Kimora, I flow super-nova, and drunk wine with Jehovah
All you fake-ass, weak-ass niggaz is full of odor

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
