[Lounge Lo]
Yes, ya'llin' to right beat, and
You can have a party or just have a meeting
Spitting and spraying, check what I'm playing
A different type of slang, that I bang, is what I'm saying
To all the party people uptown on that shake shit
Don't you know Lounge Mode Lo is on some cake shit
Illebal, biblical for doing my dance
And my record, don't you know'll, put you in a trance and
Right inside ya body, and high from off of Bobby and
Won't be fighting, just sipping, straight Bacardi and
Down, from spreading love to yours truly
I'm the original B.I.G., L.O.U.N.G.E.
And I came to have fun and, dog, me and my son in
Just here to let you know, we gots in the place
And everywhere that I perform and do a show
It's Loungin' Lo

[Chorus 2X: Sweetleaf (Lounge Lo)]
Nobody beats the kid (nobody beats the kid)
Nobody beats the kid (nobody beats the kid)

[Lounge Lo]
You know me as the Al Canill, that's who I be and
Fuck what them niggas be talking and who they seeing
My share, popping and rocking the block out
Like bitches in the cut, they turning the wop out
Mister Billy, pop a wheelie, now, it's Lounge Mode
Can you feel me now? Dig in to your roots, see how it really sound
Ain't nothing change, still number uno, down town
And by the way, I'm getting down, down, down
They say I look and sound funny, but I don't be caring
At first it was rooftop, recordings in the square
And Speed, The Tunnel, Madison Square Garden
Even rocked for the illest at the center, starving for days
I never talk about the places I be robbing
I love to come out, for all my people that be popping
Not saying that you want mine, but on it like a hornet
But you looking like you want it, you want it, you want it
That's why I'm here, to be like, letting you know
That I'm a highly recognized, and the king is just flowing
Make a lotta shake for this type of enjoyment
I'm the funky cat for this type of employment, that's why

[Chorus]

[Lounge Lo]
On and on and, to the break of dawn
These niggas get loose, stay out, until the morn'
I catch a twelve, quick sale, before it get stale
So hurry up and get the big tech out the tail and
Pop non-stop, but how I rip shop
On the mic and like, make you cold wop up
Rate with the rhythm, that is what I give 'em
Bush is the Pres, but I voted for Bill Clinton
It might sound confusing, the style that I'm using
But in the end, I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing
And funny, yo money, this shit ridiculous
Don't try to snake, come on and let's get with this
Real, just because you seen a mill'
But got soft with the kid, when you seen them killed
Dropped clients with the giants, just a part of my right
Like Ray Lewis, I get to it, so let's go to gats

[Sweetleaf]
Nobody beats the kid, nobody beats the kid
Nobody beats the kid, nobody beats the kid
My name is Sweetleaf, nobody beats the kid
We'll rock you on and on, nobody beats the kid
You know nobody that beats the kid, I know nobody that beats the kid
No matter what you do, nobody beats the kid</pre>
