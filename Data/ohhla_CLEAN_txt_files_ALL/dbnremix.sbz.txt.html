[Shabazz the Disciple]
I'm from the, thoroughest borough, and they don't raise no suckers
Spend if you want, get stomped out by like, 70 chuckers
It's BK, muthafuckas, better tuck in your chains
They putting they hands in they pockets, now, get stuck for they rings
County of Kings, all niggas do is rob and sleep
Let it ring in Babylon and shut down the sting
Every night the D's van and them bookies stick back
You might get robbed again, where you come to buy ya chain at
Or at a house party, oh, be some shit down there
Don't even come, nigga, or you gon' get killed round here
You getting stuck, so don't even try to tuck in your chain
You gon' have a hard time finding your way back to the train
I'm from the blocks where them boys'll duct tape you
And yellow cab drivers don't be trying to take you
Shit, they might not make it back over that bridge
Your other fucking boroughs know what it is, this is Brooklyn, nigga

[Hook: Shabazz the Disciple]
Don't come out here to see a chick, unless you know somebody
Cuz try to walk into this building, you won't see no nobody
Pissy elevator, me throwing the shotty
Snub lights in the lobby, man, we known for the robbery

[Chorus: Shabazz the Disciple]
When the party get shot up and everybody get robbed
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
When them bouncers outside, get punched with guitars
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
When niggas rush the mall and jewelry stores get mobbed
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
Who them niggas that's known to always finish the job
It gotta be them Brooklyn niggas

[Shabazz the Disciple]
A Brooklyn nigga still gangsta, by himself or the team strong
Nigga stay on his scheme, Ante Up is the theme song
These be them blocks where police don't come
Took thirty minutes after shootouts, nigga, we don't run
It was them riots that made them close down the Brooklyn House, son
Even Beyonce know where the livest are from, huh
This be the land of the ten crack commandments
Stay in court with the shank in our Timbs, getting it in

[Hook II: Shabazz the Disciple]
The Babylon, be in the helicopter searching for the murderers
They stay talking with them hawks and do you dirtier
You got nothing on the roof but copping birds and uh
Robbers and the murderers, and all ya'll niggas heard of us

[Chorus II: Shabazz the Disciple]
Who them niggas run the yard and be controlling the house
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
Who be up north still robbing and never open they mouth
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
Where steels get stomped out and a riot by lifers
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
Who them niggas that got the whole house rhyming on Rikers
It gotta be them Brooklyn niggas

[Shabazz the Disciple]
It's the home of ODB, AZ, that nigga B.I.G.
Lil' Kim, JM, Foxy, Smoothe and Trigg'
Rose Family, Mister Cee, Kane, Jay-Z
The original Fifty Cent, Dana Dane and Eric B.
The GZA, Milk and Biz, R-Y-T-E
Black Pope, Fabolous, and the B.C.C.
The birthplace of Michael Jordan, Carmelo Anthony
M.O.P., Makaveli, of course, yours truly

[Hook]

[Chorus III: Shabazz the Disciple]
When niggas popped at Snoop, at that video shoot
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
When Pac got hit 5 times, they robbed his jewelry and loot
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
When niggas go to release parties, rob ya minks and cars
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
88 niggas run throught the Garden, robbing fans and stars
It gotta be them Brooklyn niggas

[Shabazz the Disciple]
It's the home of Zab Judah, Riddick Bowe and Iron Mike
And here today, will be on Mt. Zion tonight
Don't come to Brooklyn House parties, your mans'll leave ya
Three in the morning, B and C.I., the grounds will lead 'em
Red Hook, Bed-Stuy, nigga, throw up three park
Even the NARC's play the precent, certain times when it's dark
Responsible for a lotta murder scenes in Queens
Shaolin, Harlem to BX where we re-up them things

[Hook II]

[Chorus IV: Shabazz the Disciple]
Who all these other boroughs run with and learn how to rob
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
When in the Eyewitness News van get shot up and mobbed
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
When niggas robbed the brinks truck and get away with the cash
They blame it on them Brooklyn niggas
When rich man throw a garbage can through the jewelry store glass
It gotta be them Brooklyn niggas

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Flipmode, that nigga Shyne, Aaaliyah, Memph Bleek
Sauce Money, Jaz-O, Ray Allen, to Mark Ensly
Shabazz kid, Stephan, if I forgot you, I got you on the next song</pre>
