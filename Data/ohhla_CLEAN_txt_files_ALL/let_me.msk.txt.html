Song:   Let Me Love You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oooooooohhhhhhhhh
Oooooooohhhhhhhhh

[Chorus]
If you let me girl I will love you
Girl I will show you what you mean
To me if you let me baby
I promise no one will ever
Make you cry again

Baby take me away
Away from the pain let me
Feel the rain drops fall all
Over my face sitting outside
In the middle of no where it's all good
Just as long as your there make me
Forget about the probelms at home
Don't pick it up daddy when they call
At your phone this is are time and I
Wanna make it something
Close my eyes and kiss you right
I just wanna be happy and be loved by you
A new start to my life
Something so brand-new and now
Got me dedicating love songs
And now I'm
Feeling like I havent felt in so long
Do you remember you were only my friend
And now your
Riding hard with your lady
Tell the end
I'm so glad that I found
Somebody so true
If there's anything to say
It's that baby I love you

[Chorus]
If let me girl I will love you
Girl I will show you what you mean
To me if you let me baby
I promise no one will ever
Make you cry again
(come on baby girl)

[MC Magic]
When I see them tears fall
From your pretty eyes
When I could tell your
World is torn up inside this is
When I wanna get close to you
And show you pretty things
That you never knew
Lil mama won't you make a pack with me
That your gonna let me love you girl
Until eternity we can turn off
The lights in get lost in love
Cause your my pretty girl matter
Fact the only one and
This is why we gonna ride together
This is why we gonna last forever
Your green eyes decorate my life
Your lips and hugs and kisses
Every night make
My world complete and
This how I wanna be
Forget what anybody says it's
You and me
Una bonita combio mi dias
Para siempre tu y yo por vida

[Chorus]
If let me girl I will love you
Girl I will show you what you mean
To me if you let me baby
I promise no one will ever
Make you cry again

Since you came into my world
You made my life complete
I was a sad girl before
And now I'm that
That you wanna keep and
Show off to your friends
Hustel to make ends
Are love ain't pretend
It's so crazy and we like it
I like the way you got me feeling
Everyday each and every morning
In that special way
Let's take a cruise
Down the boulevard
Let's take it easy let's
Not make this hard
I wanna get away and I
Know where to start
Looking at the stars laying
Down on your trunk
That's right baby boy
You know what I mean prove
Everybody wrong
Cause it ain't what they think
Thank you hunny
For the person that you are
Let's escape somewhere
Daddy very very far
Look into my eyes
Grab my hips pull me
Close to you and then
Kiss my lips
(MUAH!)

Shooby doo bop shooby doo bop
I wanna love you girl tonight
It don't matter what anybody
Says because it's me and you
Until the very end
Til the end
Til the end
Baby girl it's just
Me and you</pre>
