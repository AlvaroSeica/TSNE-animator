[Intro: Funkmaster Flex] (Kendrick Lamar)
FUNK FLEX! (BK!) KENDRICK LAMAR!
TY TY WHATTUP?! WHO YOU MAD AT ME OR YOURSELF?! (Just watch! Uh Hah!)

[Verse One: Kendrick Lamar]
Take a trip with the narcoleptic
Suffered insomnia but this time it was only seconds
I seek thermometers boil have you lay in the desert
Of eternal fire hatred denied yourself of a blessing
Meanwhile I'm on a new cloud chuckin the deuce
Uh! With new vows with sinners, homies, enemies too
Uh! Gold towel under my feet clickin the flute  
With a thousand troops crip and piru, nigga woop woot! (AIYYO WHAT'S HAPPENIN WIT' IT GANGSTA?!)
Uh! Love I depend on white doves I depend on
They flyin through this end zone that meant on to vent on
So listen homie, you miss me with that bullshit
I keep my distance homie (Homie) I'm on a higher pulpit
You cannot visit homie, I mean the beauty of heaven 
Is far from me not to exit it's like an antidepressant
You see the vision homie? I mean this godly advice 
Fuckin right, even if you pinch me twice, yes I, keep dreamin

[Verse Two: Bridget Kelly]
Lovely lullabies, I don't see another 
Thing but starry skies, pillows of clouds beneath my wings
And endless nights, as far as hazy eyes can see
The sun will rise, and illuminate this fly
(This fly) Oh why (Oh why) 
Do I (Do I) Have to return to reality
(Oh I) This time (This time) I'll try (I'll try) 
I'll try, not to wake up from this dream

[Chorus: Bridget Kelly]
(Street dreamin far from believin) I won't wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin) I can't wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin) I won't wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin, street dreamin, street...)

[Verse Three: Bridget Kelly]
I will not forget, fixating the part of
Faith I never met, explain no way all the 
Reasons as I slept, so beautiful in here
I wish, I never left, I never know it was a lie
(This lie) Oh I! (Oh I!) Do I (Do I)  
Do I (Do I) Have to return to reality
(Oh I) This time (This time) I'll try (I'll try) 
I'll try, not to wake up from this dream

[Chorus: Bridget Kelly]
(Street dreamin far from believin) Hey! Said I won't wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin) No! Said I won't wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin) No! No No No!wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin, street dreamin, street...)

[Bridge: Bridget Kelly]
I won't open my eyes again I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again I'll keep them shut

[Outro: Bridget Kelly]
(Street dreamin far from believin) Not to wake up from this dream
(Street dreamin far from believin) I won't wake up from this dream
