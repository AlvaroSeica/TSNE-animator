Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I use the force 'cause I am a jedi
But i'm a bad boy
And i'm livin' up at the beach
What ya gonna do now
When i'm reaching for my piece
Of the action
But nobody seems to care
Whoa oh
Nobody seems to care that
I use the force cause I am a jedi
But when i'm hittin' up a blunt
You know i'm down to get high
Roll another one until you know what it means to say
God damn you're a smokin' machine
It's just the bass
Irie I the jedi</pre>
