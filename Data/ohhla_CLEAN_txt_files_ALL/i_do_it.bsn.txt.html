[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
I waited my whole life to be the man of the hour
I really cant lie, I was the man when I started
I will be the man when I die
Man these hoes, take your money, and I take they virginity
Im high, I split an 'O' in half, now its a parenthesis
Crazier than crazy, ape shit, retardedly stupid
I put that weed in an air, and pass it
Yep thats ally oopin, okay
Oh, thats your girl, well I dont give a massa two shits/Massachusetts
Okay Im Westside, Westside 'til I die and underneath them tulips
You gordo like Enrique, Im too paid/toupee, Im three-paid
Im looking like Ima sweep stakes
But I treat ya girl like a cheap skate
Cause I need a crib, a big estate, I need a boat, and that need a lake
I need some salmon, that need a plate, that need a chef so I feed my safe
My crew is who Id be widdy-be-wid-it
Rose I sippity-sip-it, Im Quagmire I fuck hoes
My cashflow I giggity-gig it
Boy, Im cock-a-mania, the most zaniest, insanian
Pulling up in Mercedians, rolling up like Im Damian
I love girls that Arabian, Albanian, cauca-si-an
I ride around gettin' cranium cause my dick is hard as titanium
Oh boy you had your chance, and blew it (You blew it)
Stand aside and watch a real nigga do it bitch

[Chorus - Big Sean] w/ ad-libs
I do it, I do it, I do it
I do it, I do it, I do it
Boi, boi, boi, boi, boi, boi, boi, boi
I feel like, the World mine
Bitch bow down, the World mine
Ima let you live, the World mine
This World mine...

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
The one and only in this muthafucka
Niggas staring like we the only one in this muthafucka
How could you not know we in this muthafucka
I got my haters looking lonely in this muthafucka
Woah! Im sipping on whatever I get handed
Throwing house parties so crazy that my crib look like a campus
Play your cards right and I could blow you up, Nah, I aint Gambit 
Shit, Im wasted, wasted, this looks like a job for Captain Planet
Nah, nah, good lordy, wowdy, I just took more shots than Kobe
The realest niggas is reppin, the baddest bitches promoting
She put that thong on my groin-groin, and then it go boing
Got my fronter on her bumper does it look like she towing
I hustle hard, like Im finna lose the crib
And party hard, like Im finna do it big
...All I ever do is big
...So all she wanna do is Big
Girl, what your name is, I really cant remember
And Tone breaking tree down, somebody yell out timber
Im up up in them Kush clouds, lighting up like Im Zeus
Bitch stand back watch how a real nigga do

[Chorus - Big Sean] w/ ad-libs
I do it, I do it, I do it
I do it, I do it, I do it
Boi, boi, boi, boi, boi, boi, boi, boi
I feel like, the World mine
Bitch bow down, the World mine
Ima let you live, the World mine
This World mine...

UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Boi!</pre>
