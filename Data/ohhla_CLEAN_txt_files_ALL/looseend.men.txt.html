Dear Mum
Alot [?] is in our second trimester ?
Stressed out
Causes shes goin acting all extra
Were happy cause she knows its a girl
But we doubtful if we should bring another one in the world
Aint you said that send your kid to the park [?]
I'm keepin all my photos in my 23rd song
My best friend Armani lost her arm at the border
Just tryin to restore a little peace and order as
It's strange cause she reads the koran
Torn between what side she needs to be on
Havent slept for days
I scream when I see
Cause no man's eyes should see what I see
Soldiers lost their mind
Robbin, pillagin
Tomahawk missiles into civilian villages
And they ease the pain with narcotics
I'm scared but I'm tryin to remain patriotic

[Justin Timberlake]
My father
Forgive us cause we know not what we doin
And my brothers
How we gonn tie up all these loose ends
And my mother
Tryin to use that thing you taught me to keep it movin
And my brothers &amp; sisters
How we gonna tie up all these loose ends

[Pharoahe Monch]
New message from mums
?? ring back ??
At home they comparin this situation to nam
So sad you had to miss your mums prom
Just some song off the Marvin Gaye Whats going on album
And I'm smilin at the room
She asks me
If at night would she stare at the moon?
Is it possible at the same moment of time
You starin as well cause you too in tune
Your dads [?] apart now hangs over his ashes
Which means hes alive and wake up with hot flashes
They claim its disease that gassed him
Have yet to explain the migraines and rashes
And have you seen what the price of gas is?
We can't afford the property taxes
We just want you back at home
Where you belong with your family
Your the backbone

[Justin Timberlake]
My father
Forgive us cause we know not what we doin
And my brothers
How we gonn tie up all these loose ends
And my mother
Tryin to use that thing you taught me to keep it movin
And my brothers &amp; sisters
How we gonna tie up all these loose ends

Tell me how can we live this way
We've gon so far astray
No one knows what to say
We got young peoples lives at stake
Whats it gonna take
For us to find a way

[Will.I.Am]
The world is changin
We in danger
We ain't changin
Our behaviour
We behave like
Calm is nothing
Aint concerned with
Repercussions
Aint that somethin
Check him out now
Pointin fingers
When they know how
We got to this point of terror
Caution could have
Made the road clear
But we stuck with
Mediocre leadership
So we'll just suffer
Who knows what the
Hell is going on
With conflicts they keep on growing
It's a fucked up situation
When you ain't got no education
On the problem
Or know what its about
You gotta help me out</pre>
