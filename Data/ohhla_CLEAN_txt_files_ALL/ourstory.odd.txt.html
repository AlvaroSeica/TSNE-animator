[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
Aiyyo Mack, Super 3
Can you believe this bitch left me man?
I swear to God man, I mean like
I mean like she must be crazy or somethin
I'm Hodgy Beats... eh-heh
It's all good though I mean like
I'm not trippin or nothin
I'm just gon' walk out of her house
and just do my thing while I'm...

[Hodgy Beats]
Stepping into my spaceship
Glass broken in to see you could tell where the vase hit
She took my roses, and my proposes
She didn't like the smell, though they were sprayed golden
My heart was way open, I gave token
She played the slot, and left it way broken
Somebody need to fix this misfit situation
that I sit in, and I wasn't even pitchin
I was catchin, the hatred
that miss was optimistically hatchin
I wanted her when she was fat back then
And I still want her
Even if she can't squeeze into, Paris Hilton's under-
-wear, maybe you just don't care
Or Hodgy made himself available to be there
What we shared, was better than an eclair
While playing I declare, war
Uhh~! Girl I'm so sore
The way that she left me hit me right in the core of my heart
I don't know where to start
This is torture like she's tearin my legs apart
from the joint, it's not my fault so there's no need to point
I need to roll up a joint
And burn while I reminisce on who I called oint-ment
I swear this is some doint shit, Hodgy Beats
