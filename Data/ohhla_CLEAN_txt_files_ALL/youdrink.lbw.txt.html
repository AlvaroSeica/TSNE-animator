Song:   You Drinking Too Much
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Got so much to talk about but I don't know where to start at
Speaking in code cause they got my homies phone tapped
Y'all niggas don't know Bow, y'all go about what rumors say
Baby moms get paid every first I know I can't be late
I'm still in love with Angela, you niggas are amateurs
Eat these rappers hoe cause on these fucking beats I damage ya
Cook these niggas like the Forman Grill, lost 1000 and kobe shitting, no big deal
And I know that I'm the best, this ain't the liquor talking
He's the only competition and that nigga from the New Orleans
I hate these new niggas, talking to you nigga
Class in session, take 'em to school nigga

I wanna say what's on my mind, could give a fuck it if you don't like it
Homie I'm just being me, (hey you're drinking too much)
I can handle all my liquor, what is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, (damn you're drinking too much)
I wanna say what's on my mind, could give a fuck it if you don't like it
Homie I'm just being me, (hey you're drinking too much)
I can handle all my liquor, what is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, (damn you're drinking too much)

Cincinnati Reds fitted, but I don't wear like a picture
Say my name in one of your rhymes and I just might have to diss you
Get the picture, I'm the coldest, my neck and wrist is frozen
I swear they spike my drink because my fucking lips is swollen
Kill all my competitors, bitch I'm on some boss shit
And double XL don't give me the cover, I'm blowing up the officer
See this time, I ain't playing around
You fuck boys and slipped up
Beyonce I love you, my girl don't trip much
My main girl is a stripper, she love my country grammar
Use my sky miles to fly and he hit her with the hammer
I'm sitting at the bar drinking my life away,
Hoping that this liquor calm my nerves and take my stress away

I wanna say what's on my mind, could give a fuck if you don't like it
Homie I'm just being me, (hey you're drinking too much)
I can handle all my liquor, what is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, (damn you're drinking too much)
I wanna say what's on my mind, could give a fuck if you don't like it
Homie I'm just being me, (hey you're drinking too much)
I can handle all my liquor, what is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, (damn you're drinking too much)

Fuck gossip, get about my business,
Everyone got their opinion on your boy having children
This is my life, bitch go live yours
I'm gonna Wile out my phantom got 2 doors
See that's enough for 2 whores
Wizzy's guys is lame, getting bread since my motherfucking death row days
They want that underrated shit
I'm elevated bitch, young money, cash money
We the greatest, eat a dick

I wanna say what's on my mind, don't give a fuck if you don't like it
Homie I'm just being me, (hey you're drinking too much)
I can handle all my liquor, what is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, (damn you're drinking too much)
I wanna say what's on my mind, don't give a fuck if you don't like it
Homie I'm just being me, (hey you're drinking too much)
I can handle all my liquor, what is wrong with you nigga
Am I really tripping hard, hard, (damn you're drinking too much)</pre>
