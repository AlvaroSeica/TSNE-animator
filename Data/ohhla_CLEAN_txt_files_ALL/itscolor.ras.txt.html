[Rasaq - talking]
Uh, uh, uh

[Hook]
It's the color change
It's the color change
Yeah nigga
It's the color change
It's the color change
Uh
Excuse me miss, it's Rasaq
On the block, you should not
Look at the watch

[Verse One- Rasaq]
Ay, chrome swings pokin' out the side of the ride
I can see ya pupils pokin' out, the side of ya eye
Chicken heads open, inside of they thighs
They hypnotize, when they look in the shine
Don't, look at the time, you might get dizzy
And spend a night wit me, and be out by nine fifty
Poof, be gone by the sun rise quickly
I'm sometimes good, sometimes picky
I'm too grimy, but the diamonds is pretty
Check the grill in my mouth, the shine is silly
I'll, bline you really, in the blink of a eye
Get it?, blink of a eye, have you blinkin' ya eye
Put, bling in ya eye, have ya winkin' ya eye
Like some things in ya eye, but you can't figure why
No nigga, I got my grill fit for the sky
Look like a shooting star, when a nigga drive by
And I'm paid in full like that nigga mekhi Phiefer

[Hook]
It's the color change
It's the color change
Yeah nigga
It's the color change
It's the color change
Uh
Excuse me miss, it's Rasaq
On the block, you should not
Look at the watch

[Verse Two- Rasaq]
I have sinned, forgive me father
So gutter, got baptized in sewer water
And, I don't wanna be an argument starter
But we runnin' them street,s like some fluid joggers
Don't get ag, let it eat ya heart up
Just let it go down smooth, like some juice and vodka
But, who could conquer, this cocky monster
So much weight on the wrists, that my arms get stronger
Sorry ya honor, I must be guilty
A nigga so gutter, that my thoughts is filthy
I got a dirty mouth, I'm from the dirty south
A nigga ridin' dirty, when the wheels is turnin' out
I'm bout to show you, what we all about
Make fifty princess cuts, disapear in my mouth
Then I make ya good, disapear in my house
And she just like a car, the way I stear to the couch
If you hear squeekin, it's not a damn mouse

[Hook]
It's the color change
It's the color change
Yeah nigga
It's the color change
It's the color change
Uh
Excuse me miss, it's Rasaq
On the block, you should not
Look at the watch

[Verse Three- Rasaq]
Cut the shinanigans, niggaz know my plan
N same clips n cannons, flames pitches scrammin
Chains sound the same, but the assit is standin
Ya braud in my yay, yep she missin' in action
Trippin' n laughin, on her way to the six in the mansion
Slippin' n slabbin', off the tires missin' it's traction
She wishin' for action, I'm sick wit this mackin'
Make a physical attraction happen, while I'm layin' back n relaxin'
No action, ms jackson, to cover me tannin
N retirin' the sun in phoenix, like dannie mannon
Man we banish, like ham in a sandwich
Hand me ya hand, maybe ya hand in marraige
Lacin' wit carrots, and canary stones the same color as ya parents
Call me a can opener
If she built like a Coke bottle nigga, I bet I can't open her
Left hand pokin' her, other hand chokin' her
Right by the waist, call ya girl it ain't safe
The face on the watch, got so much refletion
When I look in it's direction, I can see my complexion
Got color changin' roc's, white blue and grey
Say, his spouse is homicital cuz ya wife blew my brains
Like a rifle bang, right through my cranium
Who's blamin' em, who fall back like the hemron stadium
It's not platinum, it's titanium
Who could hang wit em, ya brain is dumb
Ya can't become, me cuz ya lame n dumb
I'm out of this world, like a alien
Trunk pop up, n the neons wave at em
They just wave at em, mayne

Rasaq on the block baby</pre>
