[Chorus]
I believe I can fly... fly... fly... fly... fly ... fly
I believe I can fly... fly... fly... fly... fly ... fly
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high, I'm so high

I believe I can fly... fly... fly... fly... fly ... fly
I believe I can fly... fly... fly... fly... fly ... fly
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high, I believe I can fly...

[Verse1: Yung Joc]
Bitch I'm sitting so high, I believe I can fly
The coupe looks delicious, the rims are waving bye
Money long like diddy, put on for my city
Cologne, cush, and henny; I'm gone in that hemi

I am gone, but you don't hear me
Flow through the nose, so you can hear me
I'm so high... I'm so high
I'm so high... I'm so high

The say I need a pull up, when I pull up I'm the shit man
When I grow up I want to be like t-pain, a hit man
But do yourself a favor partner do be talking shit man
Your broaden up and broke your heart my whole squad hit man

HOLD UP! I see dead people
It's just the dead white guys on my bread people

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
I'm high's the moon, and I'm flyer than a mosquito
Stacking my chips, I got a bank full of Doritos
I'm too cool for school, so I'm teaching the class
Chiefing them that purple rain partner, puff, puff, pass

See I'm higher than the price of gas, going off vanilla cream
Rolling up for mac dre, leaning like a triple beam
I got my wrist froze up like computer screens
So fresh, so clean, exhale sticky green

I got the top steady dropping like record sales
Paint changing colors like tyra banks fingernails
Choose the fast life, I'm the flashy type
Diamonds in my mouth sparkling nice bright cause I'm fly

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Gorilla Zoe]
I believe I can lean
Sprite and Codeine saw was sleeping on the scene
That's a hell of a dream; I'm a hell of a guy
That's a hell of a blunt, fire it up lets get high

You can call me G5, cause I be in the clouds
Someone in the club, with my cloths smelling loud
And everywhere I smile cause I be biting down
Rolling off a bean probably mucking with a frown

But now we nothing wrong, how could he be on rich
Bitch look at my whip, bitch look at my wrist
My wrist is drinking ice, my neck is drinking ice
Bitch look at my life, don't you want to be my wife

Would you like to be my girl?
Don't you want to change your life?
I can change your life,
Grab the credit card and swipe, like see... see!
