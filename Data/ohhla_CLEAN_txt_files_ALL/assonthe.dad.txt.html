[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Right...
You already know what this is man!
Ohh, ohh, whoa
Ohh, ohh, ohh (Dirty Money) ohh!

[Chorus One: Swizz Beatz]
When you're in the club get your ass on the flo' {*3X*}
When ya-when you're in the club get your ass on the flo'
Them haters can't tell you nothin
Them haters can't tell me nothin
Them haters can't tell you nothin.. {*echoes*}

[repeat Chorus One]

[Diddy - over Chorus]
Let's rock
You know what it is! (Oh yeah, yeah)
It's that Dirty Money
Yeah, c'mon

[Dirty Money]
You're the love, of my life
But you hurt, my heart twice
Now I'm drunker than a motherfucker
Trying to find my way back to your heart you motherfucker
So I know, there's a price
When you're run-ning on ice
And you're drunker than a motherfucker
Tryin to find your way back to the love you motherfucker
Baby you know

[Chorus Two: Dirty Money]
You know just what to do
I know you know the truth
And we will never lose
There's no me without no you
I gave my soul to you

[Chorus One]

[Dirty Money]
See babe you, made me cry
Don't you hurt, hurt my pride
Got me madder than a motherfucker
Tryin to fight my way back to your heart you motherfucker
See your wre-cking my brain
In your arms, I feel sane
Shi, you know deep down I'll always love ya
Tryin to find my way back to your heart you motherfucker
Baby you know

[Chorus Two] + [Chorus One]

[Diddy]
Yo turn me up
Turn me up~! I wanna make sure she can hear me
Listen to me
That girl's gon' get ya, motherfucker
Smoke weed, listenin to Sade
I left my pain in Paris
Why can't you see shit my way?
You on that lonely highway
My car's still on that driveway
Feels like I'm dyin slowly
Feels like what more can I say
I made you face your fears
I think we could have made it
Thought I told you I love you
Maybe we should have waited
How could you ever doubt me
When I stood by you proudly
I would have gave my last breath
Now you can't breathe without me

[Dirty Money: repeat 2X]
Oh when you're in the club yeah
All you think about is your baby

[Dirty Money]
Baby I want you, to need me
I need you, to want me
I want you, to love me forever
Baby I want you
I need you, to love me
I love you, don't leave me
And want me forever

[Chorus One]

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
No! {*echoes*}</pre>
