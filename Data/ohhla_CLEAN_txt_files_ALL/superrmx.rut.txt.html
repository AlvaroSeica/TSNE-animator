[Truck]
Aiyo, you slippin', that's how you get outlined in chalk
And now that you in, got you thinking you Incredible Hulk
Why you breathing hard, man, put ya chest back in
'Fore the paramedics have to put your check back in
Aiyo, it's Truck and I'm more like Optimus Prime
Back the fuck up 'fore you get your ass popped with a nine
You run with an army, nigga, I wish I would
I can't go to Iraq, that's just war in the hood
Copped the guns to my engine, nigga, pop the hood
Pitch against the people, cops get popped in my hood
I still whip your ass, live broadcast on TV
You try to blame ya death on some fucking PCP

[Chorus: Truck]
You ain't Superman, nigga you can't fly
If you come through my hood, fronting you gon' die
This is a remix, now whose ready to ride?
We gon' ride, we gon' ride

[Apocalipps]
Apocalipps catch 'em, I chase 'em down, poke 'em and stab 'em
No joke with the magnum, a four four roasting your cabbage
Return of the Bastardz, wild like acid
Meanwhile get ya ass kicked, burn with them burners and blasted
I smash you homey, and I can tell you phony
I have my L.A. niggas get up in your ass like Kobe
Since you Superman, I go the Kryptonite
Creep on you at night, the nina leave you crippled for life
And I see through your bullshit like Cyclops, I'm starving man
And ya'll niggas starting to look like IHOP
If I pop, you pop, if I flip, you flip
That's how we do this, and that's the code of Ruthless
And you ain't know Lipps ride beats with no saddle
But now you know, stupid, and knowing is half the battle
Like G.I. Joe, no kung fu shit, I got the kung fu grip
The tech nine, got the one-two kick
And you the type to get your ounces tooken
And get popped by faggots like the City Councilman from Brooklyn
And I ain't spit for a half an hour
Just one of my bars'll have you thinking for a half an hour
If I gave you coke on cosignment, half was flour
Ya'll need to rep some other shit, cuz the Stat is ours

[Chorus]

[Iron Mic]
It's Iron Mic, you claim you the best, I gotta come atcha
You ain't no thug, muthafucka, you'se a rapper
Don't get it twisted, spit your biscuit back atcha, the chrome or the
plastic
Trying to get rid of you actors
Now have you double back, call it the Bastardz, get all of the ratchets
Send his lame ass, off of the basket
I live the life, where I'm forced to get drafted
We running from jake, tossin' the 'matic, we the cause of the havoc
My stomach ache, we the cause of the static, and we changing the game
You think of us, when you mention the Staten
You on that boat? Boy, you better be packing, the sharks in the water
We throw ya ass off, trying to play captain
You ain't Superman, nigga, you can't fly
Niggas get shot around my way, everyday to survive
So if you ever try, just know I'm ready to die with my
Gun on my side, nigga, ready to ride
Iron Mic, coming soon, nigga, I'm signed o Pop
I got a thousand more bars, you lucky this beat stopped, nigga

[Interlude: Truck]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, get the fuck outta here
This beat didn't stop, muthafucka
This the remix, get back in here

[Iron Mic]
It's no way you can stop it, extra clips in my pocket
Half a shotty that blasts off like rocket
We sell drugs and commit robberies and profit
The Iron Mic, my heart is like Tyson, I treat it like boxing
Stick and move, nigga, grippin' the tool
I'm like T-Mack, bring these young boys to school
You better relax, we got our forks and spoons
We hungry muthafucka, and we coming for our food
And if I was you, I wouldnt be fucking with them dudes
They busting they tools, you are guaranteed to lose
The heart beats to the concrete, so go run and get ya crew
And you heat, it won't compare to our army
A Ruthless soldier, we grind like Folgers
Spit it for my thug culture, man, we live like vultures
Lick off the dead, fuck a price, put the knife to ya head
Before we go, save our souls, you heard what we said
And I ain't gon' stop, til these niggas murder me dead
You either give us ours, now, the'll be more bloodshed

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
