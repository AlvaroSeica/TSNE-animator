[Chorus 2X: Masta Killa]
My guitar string sing, make me wanna like
Spit that thing-thing, when I'm on the mic
Talking to you, how you like

[Masta Killa]
I stimulate life and matter in my circumference
None can ever match my palm, I'm calm
So you know when I blow the bomb it's gonna quake something
Like a migraine pain, it's gon' ache something
Stopping all motion, you can never move against the energy
Intensity, knowledge my reality
Everything flow, mathematically in order
My universal gravity pull is magnetic
Peace Allah Victorious, your bar be glorious
Mentally the mind see every spec of dust
And every cubic square inch, the God magnificent build
And make the rhyme still, back to the paper

[Chorus 2X]

[Masta Killa]
That's word, from my soul
I came to bring gold from the trading store
And left you with a promise that was never fulfilled
I build and make the Earth quake, catch the thought before it escape
And write it down, I'm also blessed, these words I manifest
My universal flag on my chest, sun, moon, crest
Discovered by the God, of course, cuz I'm a star
Black to the core, the mic so hot, it'll blow to Fahrenheit
It's only one day, but I love it at night
Yo, let me build with you for a sec

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
