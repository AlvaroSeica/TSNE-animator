[Intro: Allah Real]
Yo, what's up?
You know Pa down on 55th and 33rd, man?
Yea, go down there and say I said Pyzone wanted to give him this
Matter of fact, give him a hug for me

[Terra Tory]
On the move to loot the pigs from the force
Chain shots the bell, the ghetto through the iron horse
From the PJ's, the eighty-six blocker raid
Peep my cause, deadly wars in them harm days
Come back to Brooklyn lookin for my partners
Pertrudent sharp shooters, but I'm a sharp stopper
Ricochet sprays and they tried to invade, one crawled
I honked out, the blood thrist brigade
Backed out the chrome, ShaCronz, pack firearm in my palm
If they're come to release the harm
Stop that jake, fill the case with some presidents
The airports exported, Gods the new residents
The path was clouded so I outed your main light
Dead right, I head snipe on Saturday night
Straight up

[Chorus: Free Murda &amp; I-Born *singing*]
Take it all (4X)

[I-Born]
The roof we raisin it all, blazin we all
Guages is lost, saved by the force
Pages is lost, saved with a boss

[Chorus]

[Free Murda]
Yo, Lil' Free squeeze with ease and you know that
Spit hollows at D's like "hold that"
German luger spit rapidly, I toke that
Takin it all, froze cats plus tore gats
Get your wig pulled back, snatch chains plus rose that
Fuck bargainin, Lil' Free'll just harm your click
Billy Box and the ?, won't hesitate to harm your click
Fuck around and I'll spark a hit, spark clips and the darker shit
Hit by the Cronz ya trick, not playin park bench
Uh, I smoke choclate, all my teeth ain't a profit
D's hate it, I push chronic, halo by the pound, niggaz can't stop it
Polo, if its hot then I will rock it
Tray-eight in my pocket, already cocked it
What? (BLAOW! BLAOW! BLAOW!)

[Chorus]

[ShaCronz]
Cronz auto, behind me, Don of the borough
Black jeans, gat with sixteen, known and thorough
Never trick, sold cracks for cream, hold stacks of sick teens
Click only sell to rich fiends, I'm the average deacon obliged
Creapin through spots, two heats, sleepin the cops
Do it out on the streets when I drop, just want a piece of the pot
Reach ya get shot, drama increase when its hot
Never hesitate to score, bitch take it raw for the cause
I ain't scared to break the law, I make the call
Crib rushin, snake jake came with six, bustin
I'm at my wiz fussin, playin it safe
Make sure my babies safe, AK 3-80, jake get the 88
When I'm finished y'all go with honors involved
Gats are spittin, blast no children
Women get legs shot, coughin, runnin out the back of the buildin
Sargeant, 16 men, 50 shots in a Taurus
Squad with inf' spit 10.. spit 10
