[Intro: Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, It's just the thoughts I been thinking and writing
So yeah, Yo, It's that shit be, Yo

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo I was, Born with that black oil in the veins
Civil War of the brain, Let's dick to the call of the King
Guantanamo Bay, Torture chambers hid in the way
Nigga my kid'll get sprayed if I stay in the ghetto too long
Like Gapetto been pawned
Now the puppet back with the bushes next to the White House lawn
Unemployment checks make us think they trying
I aint buying it, Can't afford it
One slip and it's off into that mental coffin
One mistake, One ticket, One license plate out of date
Lead to jail time cause by bail crime was too much to pay
Had me buying similac with iron while you ate for free
And then rob off employees and they had steak for beef
Like Erwin in the reef, When we burning in the streets
They used to hang us, Bag us, Tag us, Same as Katrina relief
Some say they heard explosions when the levies was breached
Detroit schools shut down, No money to teach
But we in the Middle East setting up Governments for free
Where's the mathematics, Where's casino money from the gambling attics
Automatics, Sort of tragic but it's reaching, Bullets torn across your fabrics
You left us behind with no choice to react quick, Let's widen the gap
Then front a machine to his face, Tyrna kill Africa with aids
Just like crack when it spreads to the people they want relief

(But I aint buying it nigga that's raw beef)
Keep his thoughts to himself though
(But I aint buying it nigga that's raw beef)
He keeps his thoughts to himself though
(But I aint buying it nigga that's raw beef)
I keep my thoughts to myself though
Cause if I don't I don't make it though

Yo, He keep his thoughts with the bushes, Dope pushers, Crack addicts
That's where we stash at, Sky view carries action
Come feel the pulse in my palm, Grip the seal like handle bars
Raised in the slums where graves get dug
Grandma's knit rugs until cancer devourers their thoughts
From floor lights, Spiked tap water in vaults
A cauldron of thoughts stay bake'n in my mind oven
Without pay realize there aint no ways other
Some'll rise in other men when the time is chosen
How could a tree grew up right if the roots is poisoned
Keep the loaded shells spray tucked away, Meet my left deltoid
Grimm Reap make you sleep animation boy
Like bounced checks, Empty clip, Send me fifths to sip
Certified mail, Burning high ale, Smile still</pre>
