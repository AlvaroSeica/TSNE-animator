We grip our..
We grip our..
We grip our..
We grip our..

(Hook)
We grip our hands up on that woodgrain
And roll this 'Lac up through yo hood
Like da frozen mayn
We got the good green bitch
That cost a nut of yo mayn
And got them quarter cuts of oxy snow candy 'cain

(Verse 1)
Now if you catch me in yo hood, creepin' slow
Hands gripped on that grain
I'm tryina catch some sales
Cause I got mo' dope to slang
I'm talkin' bout, quarter-ki's
All the way up to forty ki's
You wouldn't believe, how many g's
I make in one week
For those who bleed, let me introduce you to frost
This nigga soft
But to get a hit of this here gon' cost
And all work we floss, so test it
Put a lil' on ya toungue
Can't you tell my shit the bomb?
By the way yo shit got numb?
Oh this that "gotta get'cha some"
All the way down from Peruvian
The shit I got, abusin' them
They O.D., so we losin' them
Man I keep a sack of fat rocks
Nothin' but forty slugs
One hit of this buddy-bud
It'll put you on yo butt
If Peter Piper picked that pepper
Nigga, well I pick that herb
Make my way to the hood
So I can sell fresh wood, on the curb
Gotta stay about my cheese
Nigga, cause I love that cash
If you sittin' up on some g's
We gon' have to lic yo ass

(Hook)
We grip our hands up on that woodgrain
And roll this Lac up through yo hood
Like da frozen mayn
We got the good green bitch
That cost a nut of yo mayn
And got them quarter cuts of oxy snow candy 'cain (Candy 'cain)

We grip our hands up on that woodgrain
And roll this Lac up through yo hood
Like da frozen mayn
We got the good green bitch
That cost a nut of yo mayn
And got them quarter cuts of oxy snow candy 'cain (Candy 'cain)

(Verse 2)
I pick my wood from that stack
Let's call him Sugar Man Jack
I get my blow from the mouth so
Cause it's easy to crack
He got the finest gritty-green
And the purest of 'cain
That's why I'm a weathered entrepreneur
From the product I slang
I love them ho's
But not the ones that get they hair done, plus nails
I'm talkin' bout ass, onions, elbows and sells
We got them freaks, pops
Goin' for bout eight-fifty each
And sellin' blocks of rock-n-roll
For about fifteen a piece
I know you like them nutty-butters
We got them five-for-three
And got some twentie's and dime push-ups
Lemon-lime and peach
I'm off on the road every night
Tryin'a grind to eat
And off on my stove, wit' a light
Bustin' down a ki
If Baskin &amp; Robin's got thirty-one flavors
Then I got sixty-two
My two newest flavors
Chocolate-wood, and pearly white blue
We got that green-kiwi baby
It's so sweet and delicious
And gaurunteed to get'cha high
Everytime ya lick it
Now, if Jimmy crack corn
Then I crack rocks
I chop 'em up in blocks
So they can fit in my sock
As long as them twinky's keep on turnin'
Then we won't ever stop
Watch all them junkie's on Pirelli's
When we pull on yo spot
(Yo spot, yo spot, yo spot)

(Talking)
For all them niggas out there ridin'
Wit' they hands up on the wood
Keep on ridin'
Yean heard?

(Hook)
We grip our hands up on the woodgrain
And roll this Lac up through yo hood
Like da frozen mayn
We got the good green bitch
That cost a nut of yo mayn
And got them quarter cuts of oxy snow candy 'cain (Candy 'cain)

(Verse 3)
We sold up all the blocks
We stack up all the rocks
We work around-the-clock
Nigga, we twenty-four hour shop
We might not ship 'em in
But boy we move 'em out
I might not be no man
Now, but I got plenty clout
I speed it for that low
Then get it out my hand
If you from outta' town
Nigga Texas will advance
You might not like my scheme
But that's just how I grind
I once was told
That you can't make no cheese
Off nickles and dimes

Now I'm yo candy-man
Sellin' plenty frozen 'cain
We keep 'em fresh
So let me tell ya how we cook them thangs
We get ounce of sugar
Mix it in a pipe
Add a cup of milk, some chopped ice
And keep it topped
We put it in the deep-freezer, let it hard rock
You gotta bust in on the floor, cause it's a hard block
Now get yo ice-cream scooper
So you can skeet them goods
And when you hit the hood
Keep yo hands up on the wood

(Hook)
We grip our hands up on that woodgrain
And roll this Lac up through yo hood
Like da frozen mayn
We got the good green bitch
That cost a nut of yo mayn
And got them quarter cuts of oxy snow candy 'cain (Candy 'cain)

We grip our hands up on that woodgrain
And roll this Lac up through yo hood
Like da frozen mayn
We got the good green bitch
That cost a nut of yo mayn
And got them quarter cuts of oxy snow candy 'cain (Candy 'cain)

We grip our hands up on that woodgrain
And roll this Lac up through yo hood
Like da frozen mayn
We got the good green bitch
That cost a nut of yo mayn
And got them quarter cuts of oxy snow candy 'cain (Candy 'cain)

We grip our hands up on that woodgrain
And roll this Lac up through yo hood
Like da frozen mayn
We got the good green bitch
That cost a nut of yo mayn
And got them quarter cuts of oxy snow candy 'cain (Candy 'cain)</pre>
