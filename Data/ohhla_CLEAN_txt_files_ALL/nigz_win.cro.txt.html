Stars intertwine
I don't wanna miss my ride

From down south to the east coast

So glue doc is what we smoke

Same thing that the bay been on

Yeah I'm owning this bitch who hating
'Cause they can't get on
I'm looking for the same run Jay Z and Dane went on
Baby you ain't still on
I'm talking about them independent benajmins made
Same thing that the bay been on
I dream big eyes wide open
I call it sleep walking
No ear to the ground but
I can hear the street talking
About the boy who put beats
In the deep coffin
You niggas running fort 3
And I'm in the lead jumping
Tending windows I'm sitting and reading memo
With a video vix and pen and pencil
And an instrumental
Sets his bussines over bitches
I scribble sick lyrics
Then I stick my dick in the bitches dental
Knock away the dental what's pimpin' my nigga
Look what I get her to do
Her and her pretty friend Jennifer too
69ning so it's dental for 2
Raise my arm, the winner is who
LBC I did it for you

[Chorus]
From down south to the east coast
(My niggas winning)
I got my grind on b smoke
(My niggas winning)
So glue doc is what we smoke
(My niggas winning)
We still live by the G code
(Niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(Niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(Niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(Niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(Niggaz winning)

[Verse]
In my city I'm in position
Used to ticks as I'm blissing
Still the truth the voice
No absent for second guessing
Be a victim of obedience
Slap it as soon as you guessing it
I'm what you consider real
So don't question it
So many days
I remember being in the front line
But right now I'm in front of that
You can pick your biz
I skip this answer jump in front of that
Tellin' I'm an asshole, problems you know none of that
I desintegrate 'em that's
With the bitches won't coming back
Competition is in the smoke
They come losing and smoking dope
Speaking of smoke and toss smoaking something
You can't smoke it and blow
It means it comes lyrically
Like a ghost tryin' to hide in these beats
Swear I was Michael Phillips about to having these greeks
I never take some holy thing
All I'm chasing is a budget
Face the sundee, as I make no brand in this breathe
Pussy niggas they nothing
They know that fuck shit is dead
They don't want to see us for real
Them niggas scared

[Chorus]
From down south to the east coast
(My niggas winning)
I got my grind on b smoke
(My niggas winning)
So glue doc is what we smoke
(My niggas winning)
We still live by the G code
(Niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(Niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(Niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(Niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(My niggaz winning)
(Niggaz winning)

[Verse]
My chainsaw's 38 in the waist
I ain't talking leave on 38 in the waist
I got my city behind me
Just like I'm Tray in the H
I look at you like sex shanay
Ain't no cost you shit
To stay in your place, caso
I'm going Tim Docking in this tape drop
That mean I'm 'bout to ball on your squares
Like it's Bang shot
Satan in a tank top, fire all for niggas
Who think they gonna take wa
Take shots
This rounds on me
I'm a touch your body away
I guess the ground gonna see
Learn it click burn it some down OG's
Then I learned avoiding beefus
When I found more G's
That knowledge gets me knowledge
Them bitches be down on knees
I teel 'em
Giving you pussy to lose this
It's not poppin'
Bitches stacks dropping for not watching
They twat options, yeah
She fucking around with them but then
She only let the dick of a winner in her in her

[Chorus]
From down south to the east coast
(My niggas winning)
I got my grind on b smoke
(My niggas winning)
So glue doc is what we smoke
(My niggas winning)
We still live by the G code
(Niggaz winning)

Stars intertwine
I don't wanna miss my ride
When the planets allign
They let me lost me time
But you're afraid of heights
I was born to fly
What comes next
Cannot be denied</pre>
