[Soul Khan]
Soul Khan... Brown Bag
I don't do this type of shit very often
You should feel blessed

Well as I wake the dead, shake your head, disconnect your neck and spine
You David Guest, I'm Dave Koresh, resurrectin live
Soon as we step to y'all, all I hear is "never mind"
How the fuck you put a tether ball against a wrecking Khan?
I am on a level like the naked eye could never find
You tried to defy death and I guess I will death defy
I caught him thinkin that we'd rest, inside of my chest
designed by Tony Stark with the pressure, high when the professor died
This is not an afterthought - this is an aftershock
They say my catalogue is somethin like an act of God
I got the keys to take your shackles off
Sort of like I'm Clark Kent, but I don't have to ever take my glasses off
I'm rough around the edges but they spread it like it's hot Nutella
Create the future like Obama when he knocked Michelle up~!
Even my acapella's similar to salmonella
Forget the wine, they better get my crew a VODKA cellar
You probably wonderin where the smoothness and swag at
I don't know; check the roads between Fallujah and Baghdad
You perusin the handbags, I'm boozin with granddad
I stopped readin when I see you usin a hashtag
Bitch say I'm hatin! So electrical
They selectin Soul and case awaiting
I'm gettin impatient waiting, so if it don't happen soon
the dude gon' be where the in-patient's layin
I'd give my life to keep the city shinin
Cause the difference is, I don't need a hype machine to hypnotize 'em
All that for nothin - y'all make me earl with it
Fuck it, give me yo' budget, I'll save the world with it~!
And that's my word...
Now get the fuck out my house</pre>
