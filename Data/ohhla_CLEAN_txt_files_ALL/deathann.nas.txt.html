[Chorus]
I know all of y'all hear me, none of y'all scare me
'Cause niggaz die daily
Coming out with my guns real early
Laying in your stairway, 'cause niggaz die daily
So I got niggaz around you
mad like they're back for their man
you've killed just a year ago today
So call it a death anniversary
rushing to emergency, niggaz die daily

[Nas]
What if I told you that AZ didn't exist
And I put him their, played it like a ventriloquist
'Cause niggaz spit fake shit and y'all respect it
I spit that real shit and y'all won't buy the record
What if me and the rapper homey was really cool
And we used that whole thing as a media tool
would you say I was a sucka or say I was savvy
If I told you mothafucka's that me and K wasn't married?
What if Jungle wrote my shit and I'm really illiterate
And the whole Nas catalog was just an experiment
What if I really died when Ill Will got shot
This is Will rhyming right now while Nas is chilling with 'Pac
What If I did all the advertisements thrown my way
And I've boned every chick that would throw me some play
I'd have to load another AK 'cause niggaz be jealous
'Cause we real like them Brazil favelas

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Scream at the nigga "breathe don't breathe your last breath"
But you know a nigga dead when he pee on himself
Blatter giving up on 'em, face start to puff on 'em
Bloating up, nigga cold as fuck, trying hold on 'em
Loosen up the nine out of his fingers
Angels coming only he can hear the psalms that they're singing
And it hurts me, the planets cursed, B
This your niggaz first year anniversary
This how it goes down in every ghetto
So it's quite natural for rappers to settle
and make pop music, nursery hooks
'Cause back then we thought the only thing that worked was the jooks
They're tryna pimp a game that done pimped them first
I'm pimping the industry so they acknowledge our worth
The next anniversary we all unite
Let's all get together or we're loosing the fight

[Chorus]</pre>
