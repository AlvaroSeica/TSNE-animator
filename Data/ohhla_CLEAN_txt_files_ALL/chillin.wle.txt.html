[Verse 1: Wale]
shiiit this how you start of 09
kickin in the door, and I'm everybody problem
stuntin in some other jordan nines
I got phil knight talkin about "How you got Them?"
let's talk about the cars ya'll got
you say you got alotta whips, well I got a lot
I got the right to be cocky
get so much cut disc jockeys jock me...
you niggas mad cause you not me
I remain a giant while your jeremy shockey
and if you ain't heard me properly
If you speak garbage, then we no capice
D.C. chillin, PG chillin, floor to the ceilin
stuntin in my billion-air, gear on my
millionaire frames, that's money on my mind, Wale

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
get em all, get em all, pick it all up
stack up your funds like a million bucks
across that pond, they all know us
International... whoaaaa!
driving my car to a foreign place
lookin at me, now they know my face
we want it all now, we got all yesss
look at that, look at how they lookin at usss

[Verse 2: Wale]
yea, they keep sayin Wale, but my name walay
ho's call me "Mr. Never Wear The Same Thing"
you redundant, you never ever change
and I'm the same way, m.i.a.

can't control the box, you are no mills lane
ain't heard dc since sardines came
ha! and I made ya'll love it
we don't cop plea's, but ya'll don't cop nuffin
police come around don't nobody say nuffin
and you be with the cops, you niggas is mclovin

District of Columbia

[Bridge]

[Chorus: Wale]

[Lady Gaga]
get em all, get em all, pick it all up
stack up your funds like a million bucks
across that pond, they all know us

driving my car to a foreign place
lookin at me, now they know my face
we want it all now, we got all yesss
look at that, look at how they lookin at usss
