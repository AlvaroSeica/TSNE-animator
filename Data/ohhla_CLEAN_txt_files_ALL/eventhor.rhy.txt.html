[Verse 1]
My tongue catches fires and unleashes
I meditate in subzero climates till my blood freezes
Hunt cheetahs in training sessions with drug dealers
That shut keys to the gates of Heaven so pay attention
Cut you down to size with scissor kids
I'm leaping Egyptian pyramids on my fingertips
I rob holy prophets to pay for my sins
Time flies but not since I amputated his wings
I'm a firebreathing siamese dragon from a lost dynasty
That travelled to this mic in a time machine
Locked in crossfire and sniper beams
Catch 22 bullets and throw 11 back at twice the speed
Check my mental logistics, my lexicon holds every language that ever existed
I sacrifice disciples in ancient churches
Swam back from Atlantis for a lifetime to bring to surface

[Chorus]
You don't wanna fuck with us
Because you know that we're coming up
Said you don't wanna fuck with us
We take it far beyond wrath and burn twice as bright for half as long

[Verse 2]
Get a load of this (holy shit!)
I ejaculate Sperm Whales out of my Moby Dick
I regard Earth with envious eyes
I'm my own worst enemy like Jekyll and Hyde
Ahead of my time, no burial site
I'm expected to die when the Devil is blind
Vengeance is mine, cannibalistic, I got a finger in every pie
You get outshined and put in the shade
Found our my Achilles heel, put that one foot in the grave
Alive and kicking, game plays the same
Gave planes the same coordinates look skyward for flight collisions
Got you opened like a y-incision
Keep friends close and enemies in striking distance
Defecate on your final resting place
Fight me, you'll need braces to set your dental records straight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
RA Connects with the rest in the west
Home visited by an escaped convict from deathrow
Murderous dressed in a trenchcoat
After killings my trademark for death is a red rose
Living legend even if I happen to die
Cause "Best rapper alive" will be etched on my headstone
I penetrate pressure points
Different listeners, vivid images when I protect my voice
Lusting blood as my mouth salivates
We coming up, every underdog has his day
Muzzles off and no love is lost so I have to play my part in acts of hate
Decapitate you as you gasp for breath
Cost you an arm and head to pay your last respects
If you're nobody till somebody kills you
I'm ready to die and live a life after death, yes

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
On the microphone I'm chemical explosives mixed in high doses
Sick as psychosis and cystic fibrosis
Touch me and die, my energy's high voltage
When I wrote this Hennessy had my mind focused
Every rhyme I write becomes my new magnum opus
Pointing a chrome Magnum at whoever raps the dopest
You cats are hopeless, matter of fact fags are bogus
Snap your neck back maggot I'm that ferocious
Crooked sick in the head, hit you with lead
Pistol flash, a light cameras I can picture you dead
Might grab a knife, stick you instead
Since he ain't a stand up nigga feds found him missing his legs
I'm on a balcony practicing ancient alchemy
The vest on the chest in case they try to mark me and Malcolm me
I know you think I love myself
because the straight jacket is making me hug myself - fuck it!!</pre>
