[Intro: Tommy Whispers]
Uhh, Yeah, It's that halleluiah music
Uhh, Yeah, This is so beautiful right here
Yeah, Yeah, Truth Means Facts
Twenty-eight years later, You know, Yo

[Tommy Whispers]
You gotta start smart, Then you become intelligent
And for the last prize, You get to be wise
Everything else is irrelevant
You vote for live guys I die for dead presidents
It's like formula one call it mescaline
Put that on my tab and add that to the last
Do the math, Do your booze, Do your grass
Do whatever you do, Just have a blast, Fuck it
Have a cannon, Or a forty-four slug from a magnum
I'm done with rapping, I'm hip hopper then that
Hand me an Oscar, I'm tryna make a billion form Gotham
You penny pincher, I make a pretty penny every Winter
Summer, spring, Fall back, Nigga I'm a King
Your majesty, A master up in the ring
The arena screams and cheers for me to sing
Mr. Whispers, Go ahead and do your thing
Do your thing, Go ahead and do your thing

[Chorus 2X: Tommy Whispers]
After two decades, And some serious shit
Years later, The Hawk'll always exist
Strong brother, Yes, He's a survivor
As you get older, You only get wiser

[Tommy Whispers]
As years go on you grow up and you get wiser
A sole survivor, Been through the struggles then sold powder
Been all the way up, Fell flat on my face
Felt the fire, And when I was hungry I got a taste
Always been a go getter when I had no cheddar
Can't blame the next man cause you don't know better
That's why I'ma always be me forever
No Smiles, Tommy Tomahawk with the black feathers
A thinker, Heavy weed smoker, A drinker
Whatever, As long as I'm writing until the ink's up
And twist some nasty ass piff until it stink up
It's only natural if you nice we gone link up
It's too big, When we get close you gone shrink up
If you wanna say awesome always think us
T.M.F., The bosses, Corporate, Call us
Small stuff, Mr. Big's here with his tall cup

[Chorus]</pre>
