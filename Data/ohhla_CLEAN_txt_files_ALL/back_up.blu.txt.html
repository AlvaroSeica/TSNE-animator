Typed by: Cno Evil, Davida.b.

[Chorus: Blue Raspberry
Ready or not, here, I come
The original Blue Ras'... just back up out my chamber
Mmmm... just back up out my chamber

[Blue Raspberry]
Gotta get in this crowd, brothers is actin' my wild
Tricks are bitin' my style
But it ain't gonna let it ride, no way, no how
So I've been in this, for seven years
You gonna see me, but my vocals are always in your ear
From "Release Yo' Delf", "Heaven &amp; Hell"
"Glaciers of Ice" and don't forget "Rainy Dayz"

[Chorus]

[Hook 2X: Blue Raspberry]
No, Ill Wind blow away, let me rest today
You know it mean no good, whoa
No, Ill Wind blow away, back up out my space
You know it mean no good, whoa

[Blue Raspberry]
Yes, the feeling good, a long time ago
I know, I should of been shining
Like a diamond, but that's okay
I had a chance, to grow
So here I am, hot damn to a bangin' jam
And all you fellas, know exactly who I am
This Blue, play some for me, then is Wu-Tang
Blue Raspberry is my name

[Chorus]

[Hook 2X]

[Interlude: Blue Raspberry]
You cannot be mean, no you can't
No you can't, no, no...
