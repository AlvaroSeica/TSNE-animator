(Intro, Fish Scales)
Uhh, that's right
Uhh, know what it is

(Verse 1, Fish Scales)
I remember mixtape exclusive, no name producers
You wasn't hot til' you sold by all boosters
Run up in the chicken coop, corner the rooster
We used to call that "jammin the chickens"
Them the old days, god damnit I miss 'em
We was rappin 'for we knew what it was
We was rappin for a reason to cuss
Now I just rap cause I'm fuckin in love with it
Kinda shy guy, so I had to go public with it
Hip-hop and Fish Scales and a blue-jean wedding
Had twins called Hell and Heaven
Nobody really knows when they watchin a legend, til' he gone
Til' y'all kingdome come, in God's name
Come back like Christ and demand for his throne
Rock oil, I don't fuck with cologne
That's why these neo-soul bitches can't leave me alone, I'm gone

(Hook, Skinny DeVille)
Yuh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Ha, uh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Ha, uh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Yuh, uh, I live and die for this shit
Damn straight, I'ma ride for my bitch, ha

(Verse 2, Skinny DeVille)
Yuh, and I do what I gotta
Live for this shit, and I prolly die bout it
Time to switch it up, the game done got too crowded
All you niggas shuckin and jivin, I doubt it
Dealin this and killin that, lame sound childish
The only trap is in ya brain, nigga snap outta it
Ain't nothin wrong, bein smart, black, and proud of it
We all came a long way, we got a thousand miles to get, shit
But ain't I allowed to vent?
we need more cuttin in, but still they sound a bit like whoever
Got a hit and probably out now
Welcome to the city of men, it's goin downtown
But I am from a part of the slum, where the hustle is brung
Where they think that success wouldn't come
I am hip-hop, and a student to some
Professor to most, I'm coming second-to-none, I'm hollin'

(Hook, Skinny DeVille)
Yuh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Ha, uh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Ha, uh, I live and die for this shit
Hip-hop, the love of my life
Yuh, uh, I live and die for this shit
Damn straight, I'ma ride for my bitch

(verse 3, Ron Clutch)
Yeah, they figured hip-hop's a fad, it would die out quick
But it spread like wild fires, got the whole world lit
Can't stop boppin they head, they bumpin our shit
B.G.'s to germany, got 'em pumpin they fists
Got soldiers all over, gettin crunk in this bitch
Shoot up the charts with number one hits
Shoot up the club, with a full clip
How you like us now? The whole world's on our dick, yeah
Hip-hop, the love of my life, my girl, my bitch
My wife, my soul-mate, without her I'm sick
Tie the knot, jump the broom, we a perfect fit
No pre-nup, she was with me before I was rich
We fell in love when we was just kids
And see no love lasts as long as this
Til' death do us part, God forbid we split
Let nothin break this relationship</pre>
