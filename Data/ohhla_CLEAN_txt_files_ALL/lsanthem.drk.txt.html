[Chorus]
L's up for them hittaz
Throw the L's up for them hittaz
L's up for them hittaz
Throw the L's up for them hittaz
L-L-L-L-L-L's up for them hittaz
Throw the L's up for them hittaz
L's up for them hittaz
Throw the L's up for them hittaz

[Verse 1]
You don't fuck with me, then fuck 'em
My own niggas, I don't trust 'em
Bricksquad, I say fuck 'em
Blew the world with 'em, so fuck 'em
I'm in these streets, no duckin'
This foreign mac is rushin'
Kay Kay and Tee Tee, them hoes know they bussin'
I did a lot to these niggas, they mad we fuck they bitches
Fucked a couple them Barbies, now I need a pretty Mrs
OTF, 300, the city ridin' with us
Too many say they drillin', throw the L's up for them hittaz

[Chorus]

(OTF baby)

[Verse 2]
I don't know what got into me, I'm jammin' like I'm with MTV
Niggas know that we rich forever, like we fuckin' with MMG
Robbin', clearin' up niggas throat, fourty got a lemon squeeze
Coolin' on that mac too, high hot shit for a winter breeze
Duckin' low from all the ops, blastin' at yo enemies
Yo' bitch know she doin' dick, we call that ho double D
We call that ho double D
Ain't nobody hot as me
(300)

[Chorus]

I'm higher than an astronaut, I'm off the shit I'm passin' out
I don't know what they tellin' 'bout, red whites a get 'em got
Where I'm from my niggas win, couple niggas that gone pretend
Couple guys that's RIP, niggas know that we get it in
Life ain't no joke, nigga. L's up for lil Mo, nigga
Life ain't no joke, nigga. L's up for lil Mo, nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
