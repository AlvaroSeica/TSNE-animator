[Chorus: sample]
Sittin-sittin real low, with a Swisha full of 'dro
Sittin-sittin real low, with a Swisha full of 'dro
I'll pull yo' bitch, I'll peel out in some'n
Sittin-sittin real low, with a Swisha full of 'dro
Sittin real low, with a Swisha full of 'dro
Sittin-sittin real low, with a Swisha full of 'dro
I'll pull yo' bitch, I'll peel out in some'n
Peel-peel-peel out in some'n you ain't never seen befo'

[Layzie Bone]
Y'all niggaz know me, I'm the one to get it crackin
stackin money through the roof, gettin ends
Conversatin on my Bluetooth nigga
blowin smoke out the roof of the 550 Benz
Man I get it in, y'all heard
the bigger they come is the harder they fall
We can do it like men
Throw dogs in the yard and pull the revolve
38 ways to approach the new come up
Nigga play shiest, I buck when you done up
It ain't about luck, you fucked when I gun up
That's how it is, that's how I was brung up
Y'all niggaz take notes and watch
come and see the boss, nigga see the boss!
Nigga better put in work and get dirty 
and see the boss, nigga be the boss!
Wipe me down, nigga brush me off
I'ma get it how I'm livin, these niggaz is talkin
Gotta get it, gotta have it, I ain't takin no loss
Fuck around and have a nigga outlined in chalk
Rappin is for whoever step on the coat
I'm aimin at your jugular, I go for the throat
With the deadiest pen, it's murder he wrote
Ain't no competition, nope, nope

[Interlude: Bizzy]
Yeah, yeah, Krayzie Bone, Wish Bone
Flesh-N-Bone, you know what it is

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
And when everybody come up,
we gotta get 'em with the rhythm right before we creep up
I'll be comin in the back door, pack your, clothes up
Hold up, let me call my soldiers
Soda mixed with vodka, pop your, hotties and tell 'em nada
Pop your, callin card, Baby Michael, my ghetto star
Watch yo', third eye and I, high on cyanide
Christ, look at the price, look at my life and what's the alibi
I'm Lil' Ripsta, I'm Leathaface comin to kill 'em and die, die die die
As soon as we pump the studio Thugstas, gotta get ready for mine
Crime, Lay' hey, hey, tell 'em what we say hey
Like every day okay Lay' crossroads, hit 'em with the crossbow, hey
Tell 'em hey watch your comrad, bomb back, back, buck buck!
Tell 'em we pass and I'm on attack, yeah, do it just like that
Just like that...

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
Been labeled a menace and I'ma put it in Guinness, nigga better check my manuscript
Killer fo' realer, drug dealer my nigga, kick it and bail through The Land with my clique
Better check what the wind blew in, y'all better move, I'm finna get started
L-Burna from the +Land of Tha Heartless+ strapped with a nine, don't make me spark it
Y'all probably done heard the news, if not then you need to check it
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, broke away from Useless Records
See we with Nemo now, that's my peoples now
Nigga we whylin out, show you how to put it down...
