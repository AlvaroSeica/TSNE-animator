[Main Flow]
Yo, trippin on smoke, get caught slippin we won't
Shoot a hole through your ship or your boat for stickin my quote
Gattin 'em dead head on the platinum bed
Flatten the bread, my niggaz start, rattin on fed
Takin a snooze, you niggaz like, makin the news
Fakin the dues, we lounge with Jamaicans and cruise
Tux pro, rhyme for the bucks though, deluxe flow
Good luck yo, just keep me knowin where the trucks go
Cash tecs, smash the Lex, stash the necks
Last in effects, passin the flex, flash the text
Dash to jex, gash the necks, trash index
Get hash and next flow lye like passenger sex
Knack for bright, packin this night, lackin the stripe
Be whackin your type, you niggaz ain't trackin in hype
Back on this right, attackin the mic, smackin the wife
Black and the white, you niggaz smoke crack in the pipe</pre>
