[Intro: Black Thought]
Uh huh! Turn it up! Tony Toca!

[Verse One: Black Thought]
I said, I've been off the chain, since I lost my brain
This franchise player has never lost the game
They lost of sanity is the cost of fame
In that alter range rover that cost some change
I'm philly bound on the turnpike cross the lane
I'm all over like a shooter with awful aim
Pull up and cruch it 'til they usher me off the stage
From the boss brigade, and we toss grenades
So give me dap, like the Group Home or Sharon Jones
Jam boy militia in it for life, Aaron Jones
I'm on top of the world but I ain't hear alone
'Cause wifey with me with them Bugs Bunny carots on
I'm in the herringbone shoot 'em so baritone
I am never satisfied welcome to the terrordome
Of the greatest man alive, basically a miracle
Body slammin beat like I'm a killer Chris Jericho
Switch up that scenario if y'all really hear me though
Excellent imperial I do 'em somethin terrible
Shit that make your lady think of doin somethin scareable
When you slick and diss and make the women wanna stare at you
Hard! They ask who are you? I say I'm a marvel
Lookin at these jive turkeys thinkin I'm a carve you
I'm a hurt you if I catch you out here after curfew
Real niggas stand up, spend your money argue
This time it's for the uninvited
Somebody pocket got a gun inside it, who catchin laryngitis?
Black Thought spit shit sicker than everybody
If you ain't already know, you fittin to hear about it</pre>
