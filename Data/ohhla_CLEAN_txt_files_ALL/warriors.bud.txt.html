[Intro: Buddha Monk]
Warriors... come out and play...

[Chorus 2X: Kendra (Buddha Monk)]
Warriors, all night, take flight (uh-huh)
B-girls, all night, stay tight (uh)
Baby girl, picking up, where they left off (can you dig it?)

[Kendra]
Call me Tiger Lily, rep my tribe
Osirus, left me throat, tried to hide
Walking in streets, walking with teams
Setting up Warriors, fleeing the scene
N.Y.C., please envy, only to see, all hoes got eyes on me
This N.Y.C., pleasy envy, only to see, all you hoes got eyes on me
Slang criminology, psychoticly
Cock blocking niggas, huh, erotically
Hip hop be the vocals I'm out to see
Skills pay bills, thrill regardlessly
I make traps, sow arms like wife beaters
Rocking sight caesars, cramped in two seaters
Break you down demographically, fuck a broadcast routine
Really, who's attacking me?
Bomb nine Viets, when I creep it
Seak it, babies want momma when they see that
We, prophets of hip hop, teach it
Thesis, haters at war, believe it

[Chorus 2X]

[Kendra]
Tony must Touch this, authentic ruckus
Undercover girls, rush to blush this
Land master, brewing it homestyle
Cooked four elements, hand and rhyme fires
Lyrically, I commit many murders
Acquitted plenty, like every man named Kennedy
I took it there, karmas plus drama
Live an old curse, heated like saunas
Reppin' squares, name four corners
Niggas stop and stare, crowding all foreigners
Crack backs, like George or Bentley
Making doors in the law, when lords let me
I'mma make it clear, we wreak havoc here
Which you playing Forest Gump last year
Never here, Cherokee, born part
Coppin' Benz, you and fiends'll never see
Are you hip hop? Can you body rock?
Graffiti muralist, displaying hip hop
You rock mics, lyrics rippin' all night
You spin tables, burning crowds all night
Are you hip hop? Can you body rock?
Graffiti muralist, displaying hip hop
You rock mics, lyrics rippin' all night
You spin tables, burning crowds all night

[Chorus]

[Kendra]
Kendra rock dolo, strong foe, never too photal
Strong flow be the molds I hold
Duck in SoHo, where I long roam
Control dope spellbound, when they'll hellbound
Where you coming from? Boogie Down?
B.K.? Every borough, every state
Rip City, NJ, North Folk, V.A., D.C., L.A., OK?

[Chorus 3X]

[Outro: Buddha Monk]
It's the Warriors, the Warriors did it
It's the Warriors, the Warriors did it
They shot Cyrus! Warriors... come out and play-yay...</pre>
