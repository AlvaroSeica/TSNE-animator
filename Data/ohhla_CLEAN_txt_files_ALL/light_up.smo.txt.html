Typed by: ST

Every fucking day, yo yeh
every night
they call me Smokee
same shit shit different toilet

[Verse 1]
It's like
we smoke, we dirnk
we sex a lot
we got hos
and links
and becks and shots
we got weed, everywhere
on the table, on the stairs
on the floors, on the chairs
mutherfuckers running scared
Step inside the mind of a liver rhymer
I put the fiver inside the grinder and light the
inspiration, light that inspiration
that fucking inspiration
light that mutherfucker up
Step inside the mind of a liver rhymer
I put the fiver inside the grinder and light the
inspiration, light that inspiration
that fucking inspiration
light that mutherfucker up

[Verse 2]
So re-evaluate the crap you take
the backs you have to break
for the stacks you make
Tokess is back
the rap decapitating, they
got no hurt in they lives
or words on their mind
all you get is toy rappers
making nursery rhymes, I'm
running the ministry like the rap paramilitary
the sinister
you never heard of nothing similar
Get ready for regime change
your shit is teen age
leave you 90 degrees laid
like a stampede, mate
I'm narcissistic, pass the buscuits and the splifs kid
Shit, we just convicted
of a criminal case, the mineral haze
trees, money doesnt grow on it
and when they running low on it
they come and wanna borrow it
He who laughs last laughs longest
I'll make your bastards ass promise
to show a star homage
I rap, thats, my modus operandi
my reason for being
MC'ing bout what I'm seeing

[Verse 3]
now who the fuck do you think you are
runnin around making threats
coming out your car, and getting vexed
right in front of me, in the yard
so wat the fuck do you expect
when I come back with the tech
and the iron bar
Through the lungs comes the air
shaking up your voicebox
and vibrating bare
waving through the room
bumping into every brear
Making em react and jump up
like they don't care
with they hands in the air
Through the lungs comes the air
shaking up your voicebox
and vibrating bare
waving through the room
bumping into every brear
Making em react and jump up
like they don't care
with they hands in the air</pre>
