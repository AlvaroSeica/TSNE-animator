[Intro: Hell Razah]
"I'll be here, when you get home" I gotta call my wiz son, hold on, hold on
Don't worry bout no suprises, you don't have to phone honey come on in" - female singer
"I'll be here, when you get home" I gotta call my wiz son, hold on, hold on
Don't worry bout no suprises, you don't have to phone honey come on in" - female singer
That they baby girls know, we ain't forget about you word up

[Hell Razah]
She understand my hustle, and the black man family struggle
Stay with me with your broke, still willing to cuddle
I be damned if I can't tell my baby, I love you
Even though we still argue, you kept me humble
You was with me, when I felt like my world would crumble
Take off and explode like a NASA shuttle
Me and you baby girl make a beautiful couple
Same Timbs, same mink, same linx, same drinks
We had the paint and the laughter, I'm thankful to have ya
After the rain, come the sunshine after
I was ya, your friend, your lover, your brother, like no one other
Seen a whole lot more than just a baby mother
Ya'll wanna carry my seed and tuck him undercover
You remind me of a virtuous woman brought up in Brooklyn
With a brain to die for, and a body that's good looking

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
That's my mami right there, she behind me right there yeah, yeah
 "I'll be here, when you get home" I gotta call my wiz son, hold on, hold on
Don't worry bout no suprises, you don't have to phone honey come on in" - female singer
That's my baby girl, she gon' ride out with me in this crazy world, yup
"I'll be here, when you get home" I gotta call my wiz son, hold on, hold on
Don't worry bout no suprises, you don't have to phone honey come on in" - female singer
(I'mma be right here, cause I know what you live through with me
And I respect that I appreciate that you know?)
That's my baby girl, she gon' ride out with me in this crazy world, yup

[Hell Razah]
We had two kids, two sets of keys to the crib
Talks on the Brooklyn Bridge, receive and give
Knowledge how to eat to live, and teach my rib
Corrupt seeds, bring forth corrupt fruits
I seem to notice you don't change when you touch loot
And every nigga in the Range, ain't the one, boo
You like a rose, beautiful but yet deadly
I was with you and your mind, body and soul, money and clothes
Make young girls wanna be hoes
In the nail salon, polish on they fingers and toes
You was taught to be loyal, and I be there for you
Night you can only smell my Frankensense oil
Lonely, tempted by gifts them niggaz bought you
Guilty, talk about other bitches I talk to
Leavin' you a message every time I called you
Voice mail for my top choice female
My pearl and the oyster at the bottom with the sea shells
She said I do crime and I'mma see jail
Kids will grow up criminal, just to eat well
And I be with you if the record don't sell, baby

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
"I'll be here, when you get home" I gotta call my wiz son, hold on, hold on
Don't worry bout no suprises, you don't have to phone honey come on in" - female singer
That's my baby girl, she gon' ride out with me in this crazy world, yup
"I'll be here, when you get home" I gotta call my wiz son, hold on, hold on
Don't worry bout no suprises, you don't have to phone honey come on in" - female singer
That's my baby girl, she gon' ride out with me in this crazy world, yup

[Outro: Hell Razah]
Straight up, I give you all the respect
You gave me my babies, knowhatimsayin?
That's the resurrection of a new man
A new Razah, and I respect that
Never forget that, you hold me down, and I hold you down
And that's how we gon' ride out mami, forever
G.G.O., me and you, you my boo..</pre>
