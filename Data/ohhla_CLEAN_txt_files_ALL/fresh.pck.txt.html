Ha ha, yeah,

Haha, come on man

I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh. What?
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
Man look how I walk, look how I step, listen how I talk, look how I dress. What?
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
Man look how I walk, look how I step, listen how I talk, look how I dress

Stunna man, ice like ice land
Kinda yellow wrists but i'm tryina capital bright land
I'm from the bay but i'm stuntin in the A
I just left the boys, got a nigga feelin great
I'm so fresh, she kno I kno i'm fresh
Got my vans on , that's why she comin out undressed
I'm only 19 but i'm movin like the best
I represent the west cuz i'm freaky freaky fresh

Got my own sheeze? I don't rap like people
Ice on my neck, drippin like popsickle
In the coop with ya chick waving bye
Put her hands in the air and grab me out the sky (i'm fly)
Racks on my jeans, racks on my chain
We talk, comb my hair, imma smile for the camera
Hair fresh, hair fresh, smell good, oh yes
Got my vans on and I rap with the wolfpack

I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh. What?
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
Man look how I walk, look how I step, listen how I talk, look how I dress. What?
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
Man look how I walk, look how I step, listen how I talk, look how I dress

Its your boy parlae, dfb in this bitch

I got my vans on, and the pack wit me
I got them brims on me, yea that pack wit me
Look how i'm steppin in the somebitch
Lookin like a manikin, fresher than a somebitch
My pants sag cuz my heater caught
And i'm fresh like I stepped out a freezer box
I'm freaky freaky fresh
Now look at my grill and look at my chain now look at my ear

Ay, I rock sneakers that look like vans
Polo sweater vest, expensive pants
I'm bout money, poppin expensive tags
I walk it like I talk it, expensive swags
Ay, look how I walk, look how I dress,
check out the VVS bling comin from my chest
So freaky freaky fresh, check me out
Check out a nigga step when the runways out
I'm fresh

I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh. What?
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
Man look how I walk, look how I step, listen how I talk, look how I dress. What?
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
Man look how I walk, look how I step, listen how I talk, look how I dress

Look how I dress girl, you ain't seen beat
Come hop in the straight thang, bang-g-g-g-ang thang
Young nigga from the bay, fresh dressed everyday
Gotta thick bitch, watch her ass move giggly
Gotta fat stack man, the young nigga pay
Man the boss love me, give a young nigga raise
don't trip off change,
man the pack made it rain from the 3pts stance. (ballin)

Ass way to clean, how L spit's the dirty version
All in the club, posted with a dirty virgin
I don't kno really, how you figure that
Bra pop B's , ill still use a jimmy hatch
Fre-freaky fresh wit a fre-freaky bop
Givin me cop till she drop
Wolfpack, wolfpack, wolfpack
make your booty bounce bopper
Freaky fresh niggas in the place on dollars

I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh. What?
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
Man look how I walk, look how I step, listen how I talk, look how I dress. What?
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
I'm freaky fresh, freaky, freaky, freaky fresh
Man look how I walk, look how I step, listen how I talk, look how I dress
