Song:   Short &amp; Simple 
Typed by: Lil Hustle 

You know how I do it baby, short and simple ya heard me... 

[Detroit] 
You're not in love with me baby 
You like the thug in me baby 
I think you're really in love with my money 
I still like to fuck with ya baby 
I know you're hot for me mama 
Love when I kill the punana 
I liked it better without all the drama 
No need to step across them lines 

[Chorus: Detroit] 
Let's keep it short and simple 
That's just the way it needs to be 
Don't you like what I do to you 
Cause I like what you do to me, yeah 
Let's keep it short and simple 

[Magic] 
I'm feeling this flang with you, doing this thang with you 
Keeping it real with you, (baby) 
I'm a thug and you know this, I already showed this 
If you haven't noticed, (shorty) 
I gotta keep me a dime, make it clear all the time 
Pussy stay on my mind, that's why I stay on the grind 
After every show, I'm hitting the hojo 
Flock of women behind me, wanting my mojo 
Never solo, that's a no-no 
Breaker-breaker is you feeling me, (that's a ten-fo') 
I don't need no X, all I need is some dro 
Give you a couple ughhh's, and baby I gotta go 
To young'ns I'm a idol, got women by the dozen 
Always follow my motto, never tell em you love em 
Keep her thinking it's cool, baby we just friends 
If you looking for more, then baby this gotta end 

[Chorus] 

[Magic] 
You wanna be my main squeeze, cause I could take care of your needs 
Put you right to sleep, I do that with ease 
Start looking for a thug, and stop looking for love 
We could do us some dirt, and sweep it under the rug 
Keep it in the closet 
Don't want no shit, don't start it (hahaha) 
I got a fetish for redbones, especially with thongs on 
I see em and (damn), I got a hold of my ding-dong 
Rumors you heard bout me, yeah they true 
Turning hoes into housewives, that's what I do 
My staff is starving 
And I can hear that pussy calling, (yessss) 
I'm trying to murder your privates, go with it don't fight it 
It's been deprived, let me get it excited 
Stop stressing, if I don't call you back 
Don't trip, cause you really know you wanted that 

[Chorus] 


[Detroit] 
You're not in love with me baby 
You like the thug in me baby 
I think you're really in love with my money 
I still like to fuck with ya baby 
I know you're hot for me mama 
Love when I kill the punana 
I liked it better without all the drama 
No need to step across them lines 

[Chorus]</pre>
