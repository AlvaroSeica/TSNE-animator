Song:   Get Your Way (Sex as a Weapon)
Typed by: Cno Evil

[sample]
Men, may have always held the power
The power is a fickle mistress
The nature of power is that it belongs to no one
Until it is taken, seized, seized through sex
Violence, gold...

[Talib Kweli]
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less then eight seconds
Uh, they say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less then, uh
Sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less then eight seconds
Sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
I'mma sex shooter, I take aim and let it go
A dictator, the best ruler you ever know
So dominant, that I promise to shake your confidence
I sponsor you with a scholarship, school you, I got a doctrine
In the simulation, if necessity is the mother of invention
Then lust is the father of innovation
Uh, they got together and raised the nation
Birth of civilization, first it hurt then it was amazing

[Chorus: Res]
Packing heat and taking aim, ain't not need
You need you gon' get your way
Popping shit and spitting game, but there's no need
You know you gon' get your way

[Talib Kweli]
Submission is the mission when I'm building and destroying
My methods, the Christ suggested when I'm employing the coitus
The joy, you can't avoid, it's joyous, upset your voided
The moisture that deploying is taking us on a voyage
I'm trying to find your spot, but your wetter than a tsunami
Shaping it like she paper, I twist her like origami
Organically grown, known to give orgasms
Til organisms with ex chromosomes
I'm taking her home, one thing about her, she probably don't know her power
To eat a clam like it's chowder, I'm bombing the lotus flower
She can't fake it cuz I know the face
She on top cuz she know her place
See your place, ain't the same as your position
Why you racing, it ain't a competition
Cuz you already been declared the winner
Now get up and prepare my dinner

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Res]
Why you playing me like I'm a toy
You twisting my mind...
But I'm a woman, and if there's anything I know
I know sex is a weapon
And it could hurt you
To the strongest of me, deep down
And never forget, yeah
You can have anything you want
You don't gotta even get all like that, baby
You can have it if you want it

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
