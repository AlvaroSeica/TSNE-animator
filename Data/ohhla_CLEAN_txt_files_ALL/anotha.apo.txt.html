[Intro: O.C.]
{*lighter clicks*}
Yeah, lemme get this... EZ Wider ready and shit 
Roll up this nice fatty, get it ready to spark... 
Nah~! I ain't sharin this shit with nobody 
This is for me man, I had a hard fuckin day man, fuck that
Check..

[O.C.]
Another hard day's workin that 9 to 5
Blue-collar dollars for the fam which I provide
Not a white picket fence, yet it all makes sense
To unwind from bein tense, light up the incense,h uh
Choose a Guinness over 'gnac
Brown suds, twist the bud, wind down, gimme a nice buzz
Few tokes, eyes closed, inhale nice and slow
Got the salad rolled, the Bambu
Electric, Relaxation
On, Mother Nature's volume straight from the earth
Got that medicine flowin through my veins since birth
Unprescribed seeds come and go with the green
Personal use, not for sale, purchase a nice bale
Rather spend it on this than buyin some cocktails
Yes indeed, the essence I breathe
is a pleasure I crave when I light up and blaze

[Chorus along w/ weed-smokin' ad-libs in background]
When it's down to the roach, I light anotha one 
When it's down to the roach, I light anotha one
When it's down to the roach, I light anotha one
Before the joint gets small as a roach, I spark anotha one

[O.C.]
Ey, smoke breaks are few and far between
Recreational time when I'm schemin
In the confines of my backyard, no worries 
to be on guard, surrounded by the fences tall
Kids in the crib, my wiz mind her own biz
Her time is her time, knowin his is his
Lettin me live, it's nothin in this world like havin 
the peace of mind, that place all peace and calm
Lounging, with my feet up
White and grey shell-toe Adidas
Chillin, sweats on, the wife-beater
Mac and my laptop, slingbox connect
Watch Jeter hit a home run over the fence
That's when I rolled another doobie, ain't no "puff puff pass"
Every now and again I mix weed with hash
Yes indeed, the essence I breathe
be that pleasure I crave when I light up to blaze

[Chorus]

[O.C.]
That THC, qualifies me for a Ph.D
cause I'm hands-on when I study 
Blowing smoke in my study, thick as a fog 
on a midsummer's night, when the weather is warm
Me nah fuck wit the bomb cause it's too strong
Especially when it's Arizona Gold from Tuscon
No, sticks and stems, just heavy sour
Hawaiian Eye, puff on spliffs of Maui
Blowin that bubblegum, calm, not troublesome
The weed man lovin him, greetin him, not mean-muggin him
Twistin pretzels minus the salt
I'm as high as a gymnast doin flips and somersaults
Tranquil as my feet in the sands of Antigua
Lifted off the kick of the stance of Sonny Cheeba
Yes indeed, the essence I breathe 
be that pleasure I crave when I spark and blaze

[Chorus]</pre>
