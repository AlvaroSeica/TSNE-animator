Song:   Ride Till We Die
Typed by: LilWeezy2000Rexx@aol.com

[Chorus 1: repeat 2X]
We ride 'till we die, ball 'till we fall
While all G's agree, intense a flea, with me, Infinite and fuck up mall
And the loss, motherfucka betta check my
Hit em up with the tech 9
Betta keep my gun off, saftey
While they try'n to chase me
You know a nigga go 'till the next time

[Verse 1: Coo Coo Cal]
A nigga ride 'till we die, hell, ball till me fall
Fuck 'round wit nuthin but G's,
Flip'n it-ly, snoop keys with d'z and white walls
Night y'all, try to fuckin mind
Betta call two niggaz with a least two nines
And get ready to melt from all this hot-ass iron, that we find
I ain't lyin,
motherfucka that bullshit it, nuthin
Got a full clip in, dump
But no any nigga out here startin somethin
motherfucka set trendz 'n let his ends stack from the flo' to the ceilin
Infinite 45 (?) house, mergin-splergin, and count these millions
Niggaz feelings hurt cuz we did lock the game
Sewin up all box of caines, from younga G's
cuz IDs'll keep some pocket change
And it's strange hows a nigga I who his way in
Leave a nigga six feet deep peepin outta casket
Baskets lay in
Sway in, up in the wind like thee American flag
Hell I'm out to bury the fag
Fuckin around wit us G's, a nigga gonna get toe-tagged
Get drag, from block-to-block, city-to-city, and state-to-state
From the Mil-est, to realist, the killest just countin cake

[Chorus 2: repeat 2X]
We ride 'till we die, ball 'till we fall
While all G's agree, intense a flea, with me, Twista and fuck up mall
And the loss, motherfucka betta check my
Hit em up with the tech 9
Betta keep my gun off, saftey
While they try'n to chase me
You know a nigga go 'till the next time

[Twista]
Let me get a lil somethin straight with you hoe
Once a slip in the clip, don't stop trippin
I been a need to floss in the cars I be whipin
Cuz a motherfucka be constaintly tippin
I mean uh constaintly trippin
Could be off the block nuthin too much of that buggedin
You can get your uncles, brothers, nieces, nephews, and cousins
And we still gon' be buggin'n
Enough of that, I'm (?) em
Break a hollow point off in your ass
How you gon' take (?) when you been out for years
You must have been lost in your past
Betta get your shit straight Joe
Me and my guy don't borrow none, stuck penny with the llello
When the cops come lay low
Goin shoppin for my work cuz dependin on how the day go
Wishin bitches at security that'll blast your ass
For the needle sacks 'n the scratch
Go ahead try to stick up the spot
They be trippin when the bitch up the glock
Cocked for the packs
Take a body like we sure should
Empty out the crib on the haters, it be no good
Nothin heavy with the cold wood
Strangle weed is forever we'll go at with the whole hood
Show em again and my sanction
Niggas stankin
After plenty dank 'n drankin
I don't know what the fuck they was thankin
Peep the bank and a niggas like spendin Benjamin Franklins
Should have came {pause} causious
Nigga fully nausious
Now you bout to die when I'm high
Cuz (?)
Coo Coo with the Two Two
To the tech nine, rise to the sky, ride 'till we die

Chorus 2: 2x

[Coo Coo Cal]
A nigga ball 'till we fall, hell, ride till we die
Fuck around with top-notch hoes,
sippin on Don and mo' smoke pounds of killah
Yeah high as fuck but I bet them hoes maintain
Set em up with the 6 figure nigga the bigger the bang
Side hit with dank, them hoes is game
Tame like a Pit nigga
Game for the tricks
Any nigga that floss or toss fo' a lil change,
On the range gettin gamed by the bitch
With a chain and a fist
Tearin off all niggas that hold or not
Bigger the knot
We clock
Don't (?) that
Read dat
Need pistols, techs, and glocks
Shot them, got clothes
Cuz we don' riled the hoes
Now I'm gone in the wind
In the bone wit the gin
Burn the rubber off brand new Vo's, suppose
A nigga wouldn't leakin well I probably stop, not
I'm totin this big .45, inscribed, to rip your spot
Cops, done killed a nigga softly with a can of snitch
Boss playaz
I'm keepin a nigga in the crosshairs
And smoke the bitch
Switch up for nuthin, nigga I'm dirty fo' life
Gotta try to seize
These
Ki's from these a G's niggas
Cuz were

Chorus 1: 2x</pre>
