[Hell Razah]
Put all your banks ___, fall back watch me get in my zone
I ain't like pop off yet and already been cloned
Young Christ when I write, niggas picking up stones
And New York be the modern day Rome
Sit in my throne like King David
I'm most hated but I still made it
And you're a flop, that been overrated
See I ain't plugged into 'The Matrix '
Or smoke weed with the smiling faces
It's either Heaven or we Hell Razing
Holding hostages and gun waving
Tell Bush no negotiating because they still owe reparations
I'm underground where there's train stations
From my brain there be no replacements
Another dollar every hour that your eye blinking
Free the slaves, black Abe Lincoln
Only things that's my pants hanging
And be with killers that be gangbanging

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
We 'In Da Streetz', y'all industry
I ain't tryna see no record label pimping me
And I don't really give a fuck if you ain't feeling me
I still got fucking record labels feeling me
We 'In Da Streetz', y'all industry
I ain't tryna see no record label pimping me
I don't really give a fuck if you ain't feeling me
I still got model sisters wanna sleep with me

[Hell Razah]
I got him scared, can't sleep with a gun in his palm
I got my arrow from Yemen, who be wiring bombs
Big guns, when we use them that be shaking your arms
Feds studying the tape like it came from Saddam
Your Uncle Tom ass niggas, knowing y'all feel us
Have my killers come through the block and rob your dealers
Run up in his label, smack his A&amp;R
'Cause he seeing kickback while he is kick the wack bars
I'll make you a star, get you scars and some bullet wounds
Put you on the table in the operating room
My scope got view and it zoom from a rifle
It's Maccabee militant, project survival
A tat to a scripture on my arm from the bible
And make 'Rebel Music' for snipers to ride to
Son of Castro, my pops had an afro
Now I be a prophecy cooking up a crack flow
Back like '88, sheepskins and rope chains
Do it like ___ did it to the coke game
Ball in Cadillac's, play Johnny Coltrane
Raised off of Al Green killing shit on Soul Train</pre>
