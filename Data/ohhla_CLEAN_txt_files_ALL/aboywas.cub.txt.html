[Keith David]
Only 3 short years
after the 1965 Watts riots
and the death of Malcolm X
and of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
A boy was conceived
whose lyrics would change the world

[Mike Epps]
Cube, please stop rappin
so we can come on and get some, some more of this action man
You know when we ain't doin no movies
I'm back out here, sellin half ounce
and quarters of that good weed in the neighborhood</pre>
