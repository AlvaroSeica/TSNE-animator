[B Sigel] Ho! Ho!
[Freeway] Bounce
[B Sigel] Holla!
[Freeway] Bounce, bounce, bounce

[Beanie Sigel]
It's B Sig in the place with Young Free
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right
Still watch what you say out your mouth
Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out

[Verse 1: Freeway]
I miss the hood when I'm travelin, get neck when I'm travelin
Chicks peck wood when I'm travelin
Fuck a Lex cause the click fit good in the Caravan
Slide through your hood like a avalanche
Click a flick if you get a chance get that close
Fuck in advance, cause I get that dough (get.. that.. doe)
Beef with me, enemies come sleep with me for breakfast
Guaranteed to eat this toast
I'm reckless, firestarter heat your folks
A starvin artist that'll eat y'all tracks, so don't bring 'em around
I be around Ricans vida loca
They got all the toasters don't need no gats
I got a six stashed leave 'em around
So I don't get left around haters around when I leave
In the winter rock short sleeves reason the pound
With the heat blastin, keep actin the heat blastin
Techno Marine shinin, marine fashion backin 'em down
Niggas 'gone keep hatin and my click gon' keep grindin
Keep movin, lockin the town

Chorus:
[Freeway]
It's Freeway in the place with B Sig
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right yeah
Still watch what you say to me prick
Cause I got what it takes to dump the AK clip

[Beanie Sigel]
It's B Sig in the place with Young Free
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right yeah
Still watch what you say out your mouth
Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out, ho!!!

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
It's Mack, daddy, young strappy
No he ain't the O.G. gangsta
Yes I is! Come on don't test I kid
I firebomb cribs like Left Eye did
Notorious like that Bed-Stuy kid, big or small you can get it
Dead wrong, like tryin to brawl a strong armored midget
I pull that nine out my pocket I'm lyin
I pull that Mac out the closet, start firin
For you cats outta pocket, stop tryin
Take that, get back, clap iron
You know, stay low, keep firin, uh
I put the led in the gat, the metal go clap
I lay cats flat on they back, stop fuckin with this radical cat
You fuck around and need a medical cat
The led'll go clap, your head'll go back, uhhh
It's B Sig in the place to be
With two heaters on the waist of me, man who's facin me?

Chorus:
[Beanie Sigel]
It's B Sig in the place with Young Free
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right yeah
Still watch what you say out your mouth
Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out, ho!!!

[Sparks]
Its Young Sparks in the place to be seen
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right yeah
Still watch what you say out your beak
Cause I got 50 shots that'll clean up your street yeah

[Verse 3: Sparks]
Its Young Sparks from the back block player, where the grams get slung
When the back drop, where niggas bells get run
I've seen it all from the twin towers drop
to the coke price rise, to the young bulls rock
That's why I clutch the burner
Mind frame of "murder murder", stand tall like a soldier
Cook in the kitchen, hustle with Mac Mittens
Diamonds blingin, got them girls starting conversations
Push the Lincoln, sip on Yeunling
Let 'em blow weed, roll on E
See this change? Got these fucks in the streets wanna roll on me
But you can test me, if you wanna
I have a deal with those numbers and letters
you know, fo' fives and neenas
AK, 47's, AR-15 the team is mean
knee deep in the street
Bout up to they neck in cream
Fuck his cocky ego
Young Sparks rather cock the Eagle
Yeah!

Chorus:
[Sparks]
Its Young Sparks in the place to be seen
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right yeah
Still watch what you say out your beak
Cause I got 50 shots that'll clean up your street yeah

[Beanie Sigel]
It's B Sig in the place with Young Free
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right yeah
Still watch what you say out your mouth
Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out, ho!!!

[Freeway]
It's Freeway in the place with B Sig
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right yeah
Still watch what you say to me prick
Cause I got what it takes to dump the AK clip

[Beanie Sigel]
It's B Sig in the place with Young Free
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right yeah
Still watch what you say out your mouth
Cause 50 shots still will turn the club out, ho!!!

[Outro: Freeway]
All of y'all need to one yo'self
Go get the burna nigga bang yo'self
All of y'all need to one yo'self
Go get the burna nigga bang yo'self
Shit, shit, it's the, it's the Roc nigga, hooo, hoo, hoo!
And another one, and another one.. {*fades*}</pre>
