Who shot 2Pac?  If we don't get them they gon get us all
I'm down for runnin up on them crackas in the City Hall
We ride for yall, all my dogs stay real
nigga don't think these record deals gon feed your seeds and pay your bills
because they not
Emcees get a little bit a lovin think they hot
Talkin bout how much money they got, nigga all your records sound the same
I'm sick of that fake thug R&amp;B rap scenario all day on the radio
Same scenes in the video, monotonous material, yall don't here me though
These record labels slang our tapes like dope
You can be next in line and signed and still be writing rhymes and broke
You rather have a Lexus? or justice?
a dream or some substance?
a Beamer a necklace or freedom?
 See a nigga like me don't playa hate, I just stay awake it's real hip hop
and it don't stop till we get these crackers off out block!  (C'mon)

We be DP RBG for life, TURN OFF THE RADIO!
The revolution won't be televised, TURN OFF THAT BULLSHIT!
We be DP RBG for life, TURN OFF THE RADIO!

One thing bout music when it hit you feel no pain
white folks take control of your brain, I know better than that
that's game and we ready for that
Two soldiers head of the pack, matter of fact who got the gat?
 And where my army at?
Rather attack and not react
back to beats it don't reflect on how many records get sold
on sex drugs and rock-n-roll
whether your projects' put on hold
In the real world, it's just people with ideas
They just like me and you when the smoke and camera disappear
 Again the real world
it's bigger than all these fake-ass records
When po' folks got the millions and my sisters' disrespected
If you "Check 1-2" my word of advise to you is just relax
 Just do what you got to do, if that don't work then kick the facts
If you a fighter, ryder, biter, flame-ignitor, crowd-exciter, Or you wanna
jus' get high, then just say it
But then if you a liar-liar, pants on fire, wolf-crier, agent wit' a wire I'm
gon' know it when I play it
It's bigger than..

Hip-Hop Hip-Hop Hip-Hop (We be DP RBG for life) TURN OFF THE RADIO!
Hip-Hop Hip-Hop Hip-Hop (the revolution won't be televised) TURN OFF THAT
BULLSHIT!
 Hip-Hop Hip-Hop Hip-Hop (We be DP RBG for life) TURN OFF THE RADIO!
 The revolution won't be televised  TURN OFF THE RADIO!

My neck...my back...they put a noose on my neck and whips on my back!
