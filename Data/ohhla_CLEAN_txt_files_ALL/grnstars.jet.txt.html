[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
Climb, into the stars is all it took
for me to realize... where, we belong
After Voyager... my life came crashing down
I was in a situation... where
I didn't know where my life was
or where my life was going
I got an invitation to climb into the stars
... by an old friend of mine - I took that invitation
He took me to, the 5th Echelon
This is where I discovered, happiness, for the first time
I started to see, everything clear, through jaded eyes
But as I was elevated, I realized...
that, my path, is music
And that... I had to experience the world
See the 5th Echelon, it's not just, your average place
It's a place, where you're allowed to explore your mind - freely
Explore those inner emotions, that you try so hard to hold in
It makes you realize... that all you need in this world is yourself
And if you have yourself... then nobody can stop you
The 5th Echelon isn't a place for everybody
Some don't understand it, some disagree
But one thing we can all agree on is...
it never harmed anybody by exploring
Maybe one day mankind will understand
The things while we're here, can't hurt us, and what we make will
And when we destroy our world, we will be to blame
Who knows? Maybe the world will change
And I won't have to explore the 5th Echelon...
every night in my room...
So long</pre>
