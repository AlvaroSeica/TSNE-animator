[Chester P Hackenbush]
When the police pull you over (Wha Blow)
When you see a guy you know you tell 'im (Wha Blow)
When you see a pretty girl you ask (Wha Blow)
A guy you don't know wants weed (Wha Blow)
My mpc breaks down (Wha Blow)
To all my people locked in jail (Wha Blow)
To people say they wanna battle me (Wha Blow)
I listen to their style and i wonder (Wha Blow)
If a dance is dead and you've paid (Wha Blow)
If you don't get paid for a show (Wha Blow)
If your record label rips you off (Wha Blow)
You get 'em on the phone and you ask (Wha Blow)
Task Force spit slang thats straight form the soul,
I live the english life and i'm here to let you know (Wha Blow)
In britain life goes like so,
Home grown, mic skills, type flows? (Wha Blow)

[Farma Giles]
I've had enough of rappers and their dreams (Wha Blow)
I've never really known what they mean, so (Wha Blow)
I'm fed up with their schemes for the cash (Wha Blow)
When fuckers try to make me crash (Wha Blow)
It's now that i let you all know (Wha Blow)
Farma's straight up in your face like (Wha Blow)
Fuck around with the fam and it's (Wha Blow)
Task Force blow on pussy (Wha Blow)
Remember how we showed you last year (Wha Blow)
With rappers in a black hole we leaft you (Wha Blow)
Involved in my buisness unwelcome (Wha Blow)
Competetors burn when they're shown (Wha Blow)

[Chester P Hackenbush]
Spit slang thats straight from the soul,
I live the english life and i'm here to let you know (Wha Blow)
I britain life goes like so, homegrown, mic skills type flows

Some people don't seem to know (Wha Blow)
Loosing control of their mouth (Wha Blow)
When you havn't had a bite to eat (Wha Blow)
You're angry at the world ask the God's (Wha Blow)
You catch ya girl in bed with ya friend (Wha Blow)
The rich are straight robbing from the poor (Wha Blow)
When the streets burn your feets soul (Wha Blow)

[Farma Giles]
If you crumble under that stress (Wha Blow)
I've struggled since birth and always thought (Wha Blow)
Ten years being unemployed (Wha Blow)
Big man acting like little boy (Wha Blow)
So how you beating up on a gear? (Wha Blow)
If you've only felt hate for the world? (Wha Blow)
You've only ever loved the cash flow (Wha Blow)
Now you're calling every girl a hoe (Wha Blow)
Some man's feel good in a dress (Wha Blow)
If you only talk shit to impress (Wha Blow)
When the Task Force hit's the road (It's Wha Blow)
Fuck explaining if you don't know (Wha Blow)
