[Chorus 4X: Matt Martians]
Bitches come and go
Come and go, 'til they find out

[Matt Martians]
Look, bitches come and go, like everywhere you go
Look; I ain't on no fuckery, no sir sur-ee, don't fuck with me
Hoes don't get no love from me, fly as fuckin bugs we be
Swangin in my truck with ease, hoppin out with fresh white T's
She lookin like she just a tease, get that ho up on her knees
Bag her then teabag her and slide out, that's how it's 'sposed to be
She wishing well, I throw some change; penny for yo' thoughts, bitch
I just want them drawers bitch, tryna cut like saws, bitch
I ain't tryin to play Gepetto I don't want no strings attached
Man just want to get the scoop all on your vibe without the fatman
But wait, wait, fuck you reachin all up in my pockets for?
Don't fuck with that unless you reachin all under my boxer ho
That ho sucks, tryin to slide a cool one on me, fuck that!
Act just like my pockets diseased and bitch you don't touch that
She lurkin on a mission I'm usin my intuition
Bitches come and go like seasons grab your poles and get to fishin nigga

[Chorus]

[Mike G]
Yo - if you don't get new green, then you show no gain
If they ain't askin you for answers, then you hold no reigns
People call me different like I got a new name
Now I'm Mike, every time you see me got a few chains
G, for my first gold one, Versace medallions
You see me as number one, champion - this can be done, improper
You have to do it right
To prove yourself to others you probably have to do it twice
That's why I'm so self-centered, unfocused on you
Others are never too busy to tell you all they have to do
At this point I could never care, you said you see me everywhere
I had prior engagements be glad you joined in this affair
So you see, bitches come and go, all the time, 'til they find out
that I keep a stash waiting patient in my hideout
Wonder, "What makes you love me now?" I can make your style switch
Hold on to your pride when you look me in my eyes, bitch~!

[Matt Martians]
Bitches come and go
Come and go, 'til they find out

Bitches come and go
Come and go, 'til they find out</pre>
