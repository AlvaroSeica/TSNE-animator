[Verse 1]
Connected by blood and a blind love
Several hugs and circuitry plugs
I dug to find the real reason
This man finds it so hard to express what he believes in
Demons are genetic and habits die as pathetic
An epidemic, plague of racism
Children are given this prison of diluted thoughts
Anger watches on the sidelines as they play sport
Split-ups and divorce, messy court scenarios
Quicker than Mario, pistachio parents
Nutters, academic clutters
Over-protective mothers smother with affection
Unable to stand up and seek some direction
Collection of memories in stills
Weed, booze and an overflow of pills
Everything paid for to swimming in bills
Ill, sick, standoffish
Snobbish traits, learn from your parents mistakes
Love, hate and screams
Family ties broken down by the lies
The truth shoots through the seems
You know what? The truth shoots through the seems

[Verse 2]
You gave me life and I can never forget it
Raised me right and I'll always respect it
Just hope I've never been something you ever regretted
Embedded with memories both good and bad
Happy and sad, glad that I can't really complain
Though at times I felt you were ashamed
There's more to me than my name
And no two families could ever be the same
And you may blame it on the rain
But the puddle will show our reflection, spill our confessions
Nah boy, I think I've learnt my lesson
Could do without the lecturing
But do you really know me or is it all just guessing?
Lessen the load, because this brain is about to explode
And seep out everything you loathe
And when I go I hope we stay in contact
And forget about the combat
Concerned that I was always on tap, or off
You didn't really know what could barely wash your watch
Hoping I would stop this drinking
And start thinking, conflicting
Because we are so different
Or maybe it was just instinct
And I think that no family is perfect
Words from a wordsmith

Uh ha, uh ha
And this goes out to my immediate family
To my mates and my girl, you're part of my family
And to my Hip Hop family
All these families have shown me a whole heap of support
And I just want you to know that I'm there for you</pre>
