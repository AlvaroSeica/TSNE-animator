[Intro: Maino]
MAINO!!!!

[Chorus: Maino]
I shine, you shine, shine 
I shine, you shine, shine
I shine, you shine, shine (Unstoppable baby!)
I shine, you shine, shine (Yeah! Uh! Yeah! Look!)

[Verse One: Maino]
Floatin in that wide body rollster (VROOM!!!)
Top down feel like the sky closer
Never fiction knowin my life addictive
Club hardly wake up in the arms of a vixen
Started with a dream and a half ounce
So how I ended up in a party out in Puff's house?!
How you want it my kicks are nine hundred
All I see is ghost and phantoms my life haunted
Raindrops fallin dancin on my Bentley
Feel like the angels cryin Lord help me
Livin for the moment fuck because cancer
Throwin singles out, focused on a dancer
Made it out of Brooklyn, but, my heart in Brooklyn
Black bandana, yeah this one's for Brooklyn
So fuck a record deal nigga, my record real
Black Smif-N-Wessun holdin on my Tek and Steele

[Chorus: Maino]
I shine, you shine, shine 
I shine, you shine, shine
I shine, you shine, shine 
I shine, you shine, shine 

[Maino &amp; Female Singer]
This is how we do, this is how we do, everyday all day
This is how we do, this is how we do, everyday all day

[Verse Two: Maino]
Champagne stains on my Benz seats
Got my own set of Keyz, Swizz Beatz
Pretty women penetrated over silk sheets
Violators get smacked in their front teeth
Don't sleep, 'cause you know what I'm about huh?!
How I fuck celebrities then rap about them
No conscience cars with real dark tints 
Prayed for my life and never, bothered God since
Fuck what has sold I still feel like a million
Rock's that glow my diamonds light up a buildin
This is how I do Mac 11 in a Range Ro'
If I really changed it's the fame you should blame fo' (Yeah!)
So this is for my dogs in them dark things
Fantasizin 'bout Nicki in her g-string
Never losin winnin, is a state of mind
Just remember if I shine you shine

[Chorus: Maino]
I shine, you shine, shine 
I shine, you shine, shine
I shine, you shine, shine (Unstoppable baby!) 
I shine, you shine, shine 

[Maino &amp; Female Singer]
This is how we do, this is how we do, everyday all day
This is how we do, this is how we do, everyday all day

[Verse Three: Steele] (Tek)
I shine (You shine) In this day of time (To maintain) Stay on our grind
(Dedication) Put in work (Let the dollars circulate)
Split it with family, call it reparation 
(And still move bricks on consignment) Set a nigga straight 
(Just like, real alignments, get the dope, dial and adapt and relocate)
Watch reenactments, on First 48 (Uh!)
(It's like I don't know your honor) I plead the fifth (Death before dishonor)
(It's like the game all twisted) We in it for the long run we go with the distance
(Plus bucks in my pockets never slowed up, got shooters that salute when I show up)
Game good plus the game's still thorough
(Aiyyo Main!!!) This one's for the borough

[Chorus: Maino]
I shine, you shine, shine 
I shine, you shine, shine
I shine, you shine, shine 
I shine, you shine, shine 

[Maino &amp; Female Singer]
This is how we do, this is how we do, everyday all day
This is how we do, this is how we do, everyday all day</pre>
