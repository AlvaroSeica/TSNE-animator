Tell you what
Let's fuck with this course first
Just put it down (breathing in)
F-L-E-S-H
Running this whole motherfucking

Chorus (2x)

Flesh hitting them with the scriptures
Finna get what you prepared to the wise
My enterprise
Mo thug millennium Mardi
Be the one to test my size
Flesh hitting them with the scriptures
Finna get what you prepared to the wise
My enterprise
Mo thug millennium Mardi
Be the one to test don't try

Verse 1

And when it began it was the world
And we got heard again and again
And all that the world was kept with God
In  in it was God himself the boyfriend
And everything that was made
Was made by him
Without him nothing would be in existence
Hit them up psycho
For the life what's life
For me it's this rapping and this  this shine
Figure it out and again
The Lord oh yes
The Lord has spoken a world
And the word was me flesh
Now every last word that is spoken from the God comes
alive
And giving it you will need it
Exercise good teaching prophesy
In the last days
Open your mind and focus your eyes
And pay attention
Listen off course to what they be kicking up words
So fix them in your eardrum
You want some now come get some
Many mo faking no less
Send and a merchant
You probably see the gift and pick it up hutch
Protest this plain it simple
Get it then let it
Mo got the blessing
Cause then he is resting
Don't let these demons mess and distract him
If you let them
Suggest you pick up the bible
Then you say hellow
Then they protect you, Holy Ghost
Here be the original cost of cig
And them all keep smoking

Chorus (2x)

Jesus wept, get to you
Nobody sought to work in his footsteps in the beginning
When he was placed on the face of the earth
Onto the cross, onto resurrection
Lots found the Lords direction
If you wanna leave it there
Only Jesus Christ be willing to find
Then follow the rapper the Lord got here
Who ever think now but the change
They got chains bound to their souls
Oh no, here come on again
5th dog holler and hail they go
Letting and foe
Flesh harass those so cold
When I put it down rapping
You wanna diss this out it
Never then put my pistol in your mouth
What's happening monster?
Break off the enemy taking more conches
Leave it alone to sieve in the world
I'm taking no nonsense
His coming since defeat them and you stay
And safe up with your own last
Put your ass
Keep sending and ever repent
Take a look at your past
You nothing like in the first lane
You seemingly suddenly like in sane
Gotta maintain
My nigga get down for your thing
And make a change
Pin pass get them up quick
Because it will be
Hear the  destruction coming I say
Hear the destruction coming
You better hurry and do something (hey)
