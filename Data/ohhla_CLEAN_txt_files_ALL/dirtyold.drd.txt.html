[Dred Scott]
On my way home from school
Could I carry your books?  The girl gives me the ill look
I said I'm not here to uhhh.. molest ya!
I just wanna talk to ya
She says, "Sir I don't know ya that well"
Okay like a white boy I said "Swell!"
And walked away with my head down
Feelin kinda funny just lookin at the ground
Kickin funky beats all the time with the flow
On the mic I'm grown yes I got to steal the show
Like this y'all, like uhh.. whatever
Kick it off me, yeah..
