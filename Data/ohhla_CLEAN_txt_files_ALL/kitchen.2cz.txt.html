Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whiffing
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

I go hard in the mother fucker kitchen using baby bottles for the lean
Wifey says I'm tripping, plus I got maybelline smeared right bellow my zipper
I'm a Kama Sutra reader and a conjure drinker
Hot on the stove, smoking like reefer
This work ain't bout shit, that's why it's cheaper
This ho ain't bout shit, that's why she's cheaper
All we blow is strong, that's why you weaker!
Wait up, yo status change when you wait up
Waiting on the meal, I already put my plate up!
Nigga fall back up, already put my rake up
Every time I leave the booth they put yellow tape up
Hair weave killa, messing up her make-up
Pyrex vision and I'm about to cook a cake up
Get a 4, add a lil water
Get her in a track, and ride her like a motor!

[Chorus]
I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whiffing
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

[Young Jeezy]
It's just a three watches, asshole!
One platinum, one white, one rose gold
Drive a solid gold Rolls to the Rose Bowl
Rose in the club for my rose home!
Man fuck these niggas I got blow goals
I count money all night, I need some no-doze
Here to try, I want it easy, I need a bankroll
All the money I the trunk, bitch the bank roll
I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen, nigga
Got me standing at that water like I'm fishing, nigga!
Never know about me, I pull a bass out
Drop a 250 in and pull a half out
Had to do it for the town and the trap niggas
Me and 2 chains, it's over for you rap niggas!
And nothin says butter like parkay
And nothin make them J's stutter like hard yay

[Chorus]
I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whiffing
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

It started in the kitchen, king of the whipping
Denzel in glory, tear drop was missing!
Just like the roof is riding in that Chris Brown
Two seater deuces, peeling like I skip town!
Pocket full of brick money, neck full of black gold
Black diamonds got the Jesus piece like [?]
That's 2 chainz. I'm [?] I'm for everyone I cook I make [?]
Mary Kate and Ashley, Tia and Tamara, 2 in the 4 like the Porsche Panamara
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, vision clouded by the coke
Ain't makin it clearer!
I make it look easy, I rap it up greezy
Bandana around the brick, I make him look jeezy
But I push the ton of it get the name right
Who else could fly and then land on the same flight? Pushhh

[Chorus]
I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whiffing
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!</pre>
