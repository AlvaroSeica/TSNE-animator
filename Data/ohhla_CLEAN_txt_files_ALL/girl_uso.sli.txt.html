Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Girl you is so fine
Hold you near to me
All the time
Things ill do for you
Would you do for me?
Hold me too
Gold is in your eyes
Need you near to me
All the time
Lord i understand
Things youll do for me
Do to me

Girl
(girl go)
Go slow
(nicely for a night just to live)
That live for you girl
(and move on)
Boy
(let go)
Go slow
(nicely for a night just to live)
Thats been for you world
(and move on)

Your not tryin'
Comin' in you hope you be the problem like the lyin'
You be better than them
So, you never biting
Frontin' all the shit and then the one they are reciting
Cuz you better than them

Your not tryin,
Comin in you hope you all be burnin' like the lion
You be tougher than them
So, you never biting
Fighting all the shit and then the people are reciting
Cuz you better than them

Girl
(girl go)
Go slow
(nicely for a night just to live)
That live for you girl
(and move on)
Boy
(let go)
Go slow
(nicely for a night just to live)
Thats been for you world
(and move on)

So, when I was just a little young child,
Playin every game on the streets
Ghetto, someone says, "Who are fatherless?"
There was a mother, are you bet that you could keys
Speakin out the mind, and then a friend that who will leach
Bless 'em s-low, body write a double feat
Spirits come out and just to understand the beats
In this wonderland world

I remember the days up in the past
Time didn't matter
I remember the days up in the past
Time didn't matter

Girl
(girl go)
Go slow
(nicely for a night just to live)
That live for you girl
(and move on)
Boy
(let go)
Go slow
(nicely for a night just to live)
Thats been for you world
(and move on)</pre>
