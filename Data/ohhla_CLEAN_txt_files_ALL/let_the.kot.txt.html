Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Daddy why are people dropping bomb on each other?

Let the sunshine

Some like sunshine some like rain
some like pleasure and some like pain
some like peace and some like
war
and some don't even know what there fightin for
what your fightin for?
what your fightin for?
Do you ever really know wutcha fighting for?

Let the sun shine
All I wanna do is live this beautiful life
feel free wit my girl
my friends and family
Spread my
peace and love and truth and unity
tryin to stop all the violence and the wars over sea's
people come
people go
I know this lifes a trip but I cant be depressed over someone elses nonsense
theres no
reason or time for me to be mad or sad
so do you even really know?

Some like sunshine some like rain
some like pleasure and some like pain
some like peace and some like
war
and some don't even know what there fightin for
what your fightin for?
what your fightin for?
Do you ever really know wutcha fighting for?

Let the sun shine

You and you's too im fightin for that to
and I hope all the soldiers come back safe real soon
we got
peoples being fought on the streets everyday
wile the rich fill there pockets and the po (poor) just pay,
uhh
Im fightin for love and fightin for life
against those doing wrong and for those doing right
yea,
for my family and my future to come
cause if I dont fight now there just might not be one

Some like sunshine some like rain
some like pleasure and some like pain
some like peace and some like
war
and some don't even know what there fightin for
what your fightin for?
what your fightin for?
Do you even really know wutcha fighting for? what your fightin for?

ohhhhh ohhhhh
let the sunshine
ohhhhh

You see I can see light in the strangest ways
on the darkest nights and the coldest days
and im amazed
that some how that I can keep smilin
I can hear music in the depths of silence
I can find peace in the
middle of violence and I can be calm when I should be wild
and I can find hope when there is despair and I
dont feel alone when theres noone there

Some like sunshine some like rain
some like pleasure and some like pain
some like peace and some like
war
and some don't even know what there fightin for
what your fightin for?
what your fightin for?
Do you ever really know what your fighting for? what your fightin for?

Let the sunshine
