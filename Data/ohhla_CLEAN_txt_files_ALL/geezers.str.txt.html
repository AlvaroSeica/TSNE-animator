Geezers need excitement
If there lives don't provide them they stay incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If there lives don't provide them they stay incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense

Out the club about three to the takeaway
The shit in a trey merchants
Shops got special perchant for the disorderly
Geezers looking ordinary and a few looking larry
Chips fly round to the sound of a ladies chientry and ascendry
Waitin to blast, no arm with a contest who can throw the furthest
Behind the counter they look nervous
But...carry on cuttin the finest cuts of chicken from the big spinnin stick
Then over flies a chick, flips, snips you on the back
You spin round on the attack, you play now
He looks like a cheshyire cat, almost falls down, door frowns
And Superman my lasers don't even register
By now you want to level this twat
And forever you're going to regret that, your choice of path
So mashes add up and your girl's now fed up
Stop to think its never going to be
the Jackie Chan scene it coulda been to end up

Geezers need excitement
If there lives don't provide them they stay incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If there lives don't provide them they stay incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense

So you owe somone money subbin skunny
Best pay me Billy, no worries
150 on Sunday then in some way that turns into Wednesday
Then go straight to pay on a hazy evening in a local bar cafe
What a way
What a way
Just to recap for those in the back this is everyday tit for tat
You O you D your own car pay back fee suddenly he's the buddy
So you tell your mates you could have him anyway to look geez
But ease a shady fuck, beam a free series
Lock, stock and two fat fuck backin him up
Can't convey enough of his desire for the paper stuff
In a blunt fashion Billy's angry with a passion
So please just accept the fact it ain't happenin and go back to your runnin's
Cause you might get yourself in trouble one a these days

Geezers need excitement
If there lives don't provide them they stay incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If there lives don't provide them they stay incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense

Get a hold of this bird after pub closin hours
Would you go lightly snow don't think so some how
In the winter showers but she'll never know and your face will never show shit
This is how goes it besides she was well fit, and who could resist
Move up to the next place
Smooth club, flex, bass, beats, and your best mates
All down, nice sound, Smirnoff Ice rounds
MC's clowning, brute boys frowning, everythings sweet
Everythings tucked in and round here were all downing
But all of a sudden though just through the smoke
is your bird laughin and jokin with a bloke
Ain't just that either as she moves closer
in a shape that looks like they're lovers
He's toungin her
All rage sweeps up through your torso
Your more so ready to go over and show him who's man
Football fan style, leave it in the can for awhile
Cause even as they smiles he's still got choices
Don't listen to them voices
Then at the end of the day you may just have caused this
So leave the forces

Geezers need excitement
If there lives don't provide them they stay incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense
Geezers need excitement
If there lives don't provide them they stay incite violence
Common sense, simple common sense </pre>
