[Intro: Kelly Rowland]
(Turn the lights on)
I'll be representin, representin
I'll be representin, representin

[Ludacris]
LUDA!! Yeah..
You represent for bad bitches all around the world
The way you put it down in between the sheets is like no other girl
You done took it a whole another level of freakiness when you blow my mind
To the point where all the other women kinda feelin like you stole they shine
So I better come with it, ha! Then I better come spilt it
And I admit that I'm feelin a little pressure when you tellin me I better come get it
Ha! But I'm the man for the job; can't nobody do it quite like I do
And the same go for you, we a match made in heaven I'ma stand right by you
While you sayin

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland] + (Luda)
Just wanna keep all your attention baby
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
It turns me on to know I turn you on, yeah
(Okay, okay, okay)
Can I grab the wheel and drive you crazy?
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
Sit in the front row and watch me perform
(You do that and you gon' learn today!)
I'll be representin, representin
I'll be representin, representin

[Ludacris] + (Kelly)
Get on that thang {*3X*} and represent
Get on that thang {*3X*} (watch how I put it down)
Put it down like - aight - only know you can do it
Then I'ma hit every single one of your spots and really ain't no need to walk me through it
But you can talk me through it, when I'm askin if it's mine
Cause I'mma be your +Motivation+ just tryin to see if you can break my fuckin spine
I'm so attracted to the way you carry yourself and keep yo' composure
You a lady in the street but behind closed doors you're a fuckin soldier
A brother would never know, that's how you like it ha
But that booty pack a mean punch and I'ma spike it ha!
While you sayin

[Chorus]

[Ludacris] + (Kelly)
Get on that thang {*3X*} and represent
Get on that thang {*3X*} (watch how I put it down)
You're incredible, edible, unforgettable
Body is so angelical, a rebel with a cause
Speaking in hypotheticals, could I marry you if I wanted to
I'll take you how you comin just learn to live with your flaws
Even though it's not that many you give me that good and plenty
Then I walk around all day grinnin my mind and body are gone
That JJ so sublime, throw it in the air and turn to sunshine
You make me wanna call the crib and say I'm never comin home
Luda~!

[Chorus]

[Ludacris] + (Kelly)
Get on that thang {*3X*} and represent
Get on that thang {*3X*} (watch how I put it down)
(I'll be representin, representin)
(I'll be representin, representin, watch how I put it down)</pre>
