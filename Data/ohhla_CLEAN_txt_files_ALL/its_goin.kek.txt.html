(*talking*) 
H-Town, in effect for Texas 
Southside, of the H-Town 
Northside, of the H-Town 
Eastside, of the H-Town 
Westside, of the H-Town 
  
[Hook] 
It's going down, and you know it's going down 
All these playas coming up, out that H-Town 
It's going down, and you know we bout to clown 
All these ballers representing, that damn H-Town 
  
[Lil' Keke] 
Blaze up the endo, light the chocolate tai 
Sitting on South Grey, screens falling out the sky 
Hoes listening ass kissing, wanna buy me Ralph Lauren 
Cause big ol' 19's, look lovely on a foreign 
I ain't barring the baddest, the V-12 is the baddest 
A rhyming apparatus, gave me superstar status 
Longer gets my list, haters got me pissed 
I use to sell rocks, now they all on my wrist 
Feel this before you step, step and get finished 
The playa the pimp, young thug and a menace 
Pretenders is endless, and cranked up confusion 
Ya sweet gal is boosting, knocking all Houston 
  
[Hook] 
It's going down, and you know it's going down 
All these playas coming up, out that H-Town 
It's going down, and you know we bout to clown 
All these ballers representing, that damn H-Town 
It's going down, and you know it's going down 
Throw your hands in the air, for that H-Town 
It's going down, and they can't really see 
Screwed Up Click for life, this is Lil' Keke 
  
[Lil' Keke] 
Twos, is balling in the mix 
And hit me on the beep, if you need 36 
Quick licks, with the grams and pyrexes 
I make it mighty wreckless, to run up on the Lexus 
It's endless, game from a Southern gang banger 
No anger to a stranger, but it's one up in the chamber 
Of the plastic glock, cause haters come in flocks 
It don't phase born and raised, of the 8100 block 
Of Herschelwood, and the point is understood 
We keep it all good, in this crack controlled hood 
It ain't too late to set it straight, real playas don't hate 
Push weight and keep faith, in the money that I make 
I'ma break, five hundred mean gold 
Tapes sold story told, from the North and South pole 
21 years old, water bound won't drown 
Just another pimp, coming out that H-Town 
  
[Hook] 
It's going down, and you know it's going down 
All these playas coming up, out that H-Town 
It's going down, and you know we bout to clown 
All these ballers representing, that damn H-Town 
It's going down, and you know it's going down 
Throw your hands in the air, for that H-Town 
It's going down, and they can't really see 
Southside representing, this is Lil' Keke 
  
[Lil' Keke] 
First three who it be, L-I-L-K-E 
That's me I'm a G, from the Southside of the three 
You and me baby, let's get a room for a hour 
Get high as a tower, bust a nut and hit the shower 
Get gone in the wind, after while it's on again 
This time bring a friend, a couple of corners we gone bend 
Let's pretend that this sin, ain't even being committed 
Once I split it then I hit, you in love go on admit it 
It's going down, yeah I'm talking to you 
H-Town (H-Town), smoked out jamming Screw 
Tell your crew it's 9-7, and ain't no refusing 
We got em to the bottom, now they all loving Houston 
  
[Hook] 
It's going down, and you know it's going down 
All these playas coming up, out that H-Town 
It's going down, and you know we bout to clown 
All these ballers representing, that damn H-Town 
It's going down, and you know it's going down 
Throw your hands in the air, for that H-Town 
It's going down, and they can't really see 
Herschelwood my hood, this is Lil' Keke</pre>
