Listen man, what you listenin' to?
Pick a hand, any hand will do
Then pick a card and listen hard
And tell me which is God and which is not
First up you got the Jack of spades
Now this cat is like a jack of trades
He'll fascinate you with his accolades
And fabricate about the cash he's made
Juggles stories like a balancing act
No job - a brotha's too talented for that
Gives just to get
Watch his gimmicks and tricks cause Jack be nimble and Jack be quick
Not just to jump a candle stick
But in a jumpin' jack flash Jack will run a scandal quick
No friends - even his fams holds back
And every time he shows up they're like "Hit the road, Jack!"

Now put him back in the deck
Let me shuffle it
Now cut the deck, let's see what you get
Make sure the crowd has seen what it was
Right now we're dealin' with the Queen of Clubs
Steppin' out dressed to kill
The name of the game is sex appeal
She knows if she can get 'em to look
Long and hard enough well then the brotha is hooked
And once he's hooked then how much will he bend?
The goal is to try find out how much will he spend
It's not just that she needs more in her purse
She's really just try'n to find out how much is she worth
So every look, every glance means something
I mean, if they want her that must mean she's something
How else will she ever know?
So every time they open up the club then she's just got to go

You're probably wonderin' "What's this shiny thing?"
This card here is for the Diamond King
He's the one with all the shine and bling
From rims to brims he rocks the finer things
You can always see him step on the block
He's got to show off and show all of the stuff that he's got
It's needless how he teases the kids
The kids think they have to bling like the Diamond King did
And he says he's been "blessed" with his wealth
But not to help others he just blesses his self
Burns through money like fire through wood
And only earns more money to acquire more goods
He sits back as he looks at his rack- of clothes
Hats and sneakers and jackets that match
Chains and all his shiny things from the store
And somehow it's not enough and so he's searching for more

Alright folks, this is the part of the show
Where you can leave now and grab a parting gift at the door
For participating, but these cards came in a party of four
And the last card hasn't been played it's only partially showin'

The last card hasn't been played it's only partially showin' (Ohhhh)
The last card hasn't been played it's only partially showin' (Yoooo)
The last card hasn't been played it's only partially showin' (Noooo)
The last card hasn't been played it's only partially showin'

Listen man, what'chu listenin' to?
Pick a hand, any hand will do
Then pick a card and listen hard
And tell me which is God and which is not
You shouldn't have to think too hard
To guess that the next card would be the King of hearts
He's the one they look to to put things back together after things fall apart
He's a specialist -
Especially when it comes to getting inside of a heart and testin' it
Messin' with all parameters
Call examiners with X-ray machines - to Him they all are amateurs
He knows the inner workings, searching
The deep things of it like what it loves, then He's surfacing the real issues
Such as how the heart feels about things like Him in particular
And He labels it sin
When the heart beats more for anything then it does for Him
So next time your heart's racing
Try replacing what you're chasing with Him and then embrace Him
Takes the Spirit of God to do that -
Make a man trade his spades and become a new Jack
In fact after a cat's born a-gain
A brotha' like little Jack'll warn a
Sista like the Queen of Clubs
That next to the King of Hearts these dudes in the Club are scrubs
Yeah they tossin' her a couple of dubbs
But Christ outdid them and outbid them all with His blood
And He outshines the Diamond King
No necklace - His essence is pure bling
Ice ain't worth a thing
Your shine don't hurt the King
If I was you I'd start worshiping
But watch out for the joker cause the joker plays wild
With his pitchfork poker and his poker face smile
But the dealer is a healer and he's also a pro
A card shark at hard hearts and that's the end of the show</pre>
