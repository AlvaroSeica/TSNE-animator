Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Every day I wake up I gotta answer my phone
6 cell phone probably get it on john
Bust a 36, 12 hundred for a zone
Go more dog louje looking for a bone
Run them bands up
Run them run them bands up
Run them bands up
Run them run them bands up
Get your grounds up
Get your get your grounds up
Get your grounds up
Get your get your grounds up

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning then I wash my damn face
Dear help me God, help me see another day
They steal with a nigga help me avoid a drug case
Bailed on twey trying to spray me with some mace
Dragging down across them let them on a bullet chase
Creep to the valley and you may he got away
Burried next day, same spot, selling yale
Fuck what you heard dog I'm trying to get paid

[Chorus]
Every day I wake up I gotta answer my phone
6 cell phone probably get it on john
Bust a 36, 12 hundred for a zone
Go more dog louje looking for a bone
Run them bands up
Run them run them bands up
Run them bands up
Run them run them bands up
Get your grounds up
Get your get your grounds up
Get your grounds up
Get your get your grounds up

[Verse 2]
Got them grounds up
Them I run them bands up
Fresh out the shower, a hundred dollar hair cut
Then I hit the crash then go run them plays up
A hundred to one thousand nigga can't play us
Made in the hood southern valley raised us
Just to go to the bus stop played us
All day trappers all the day love us
12 can't stand us but they can't bust us

[Chorus]
Every day I wake up I gotta answer my phone
6 cell phone probably get it on john
Bust a 36, 12 hundred for a zone
Go more dog louje looking for a bone
Run them bands up
Run them run them bands up
Run them bands up
Run them run them bands up
Get your grounds up
Get your get your grounds up
Get your grounds up
Get your get your grounds up</pre>
