[Intro: Cno Evil (Li Mouse) w/ "Fish" intro]
Peace, peace, peace, 46? I don't know, Rae (Yo)
Stop, what, Rae? (Yeah, yo, come on, man, you can't even front on me, man!)
Whoo, what, what, what (Yeah, yeah, yeah, we in here)
Hold up, alright roll, roll, you roll? My roll? (Come on, man)
(This muthafucka always fronting on me, this bitch Chiqua)
Why he talking bout drugs for in the background? (Yeah)
Now change that shit, heheh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Cno Evil]
We fuck tricks, shady chicks, and upset women
Who only seem happy for that one living moment
Get her on the phone, and she won't leave you alone
Keep hearing her yapp away, til you let her meet "tone"
And by that I mean the dial, got her in denial
Won't let you rest for a minute or a while
Won't let you have female friends, that shit is crazy
Cuz she can't act like them, that chick is lazy
Got her crying on the phone, speaker phone disaster
Friends in the background, covering the laughter
Only way you keep her shut, is when you smash her
And to get it over quick, you just do it faster
She coming over, man, she ain't coming over
She full of empty promises and unacted vulgar
Words, just nouns, verbs and slurs
The way they chirp away, reason why we call 'em 'birds'
Beak head (heh) with no eggs in your nest (heh)
Feathered flesh (heh) wings rest by your chest (heh)
Seedless (heh) got no kids in your pics (heh)
Seems just like you be asking for this, Chick (heh)
WIC checks in your future, girl
Women, Infants &amp; Children, but not me in your world
I don't want to be like Chris Rock; "I Think I Love My Wife"
But even like OJ who knows he loves the knife
Trife life that we live everyday (day) day (day)
Listen to the words in my rhymes that I say (say)
Listens to the rhymes and the words that I slay (slay)
Wishing I was hers for a third of the day, nay

[Li-Mouse]
Now check this one, you must of been stupid to miss this one
Mouse won't holla unless he's with a bottle of this rum
Chilling in the cut, not trynna make a scene
You a clown, well you ain't a part of this team (nah)
Chicks wondering, why Mouse won't come and approach them
I ain't trynna be one of these dudes that try to post them
Find us eating fish, halibet, salmon and whitening
The way we step in the place, is just enlightening
And you know my wallabies are swiss suede or leather
Mainly that, only depends on the scene and the weather
I see you, stop fronting on us, like we trynna be cool
I know that drunk bitch was trynna play me for a fool
Come swap stories, what could be your occupation
I'mma dig deep down in your brain, like an operation
Let's blow this joint, the DJ's playing wack joints
Slide in The Rodentz, now you know it's on point, yeah</pre>
