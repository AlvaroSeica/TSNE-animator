[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, Killa Mob, Red Heroine

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Dear Lord, How could you create me
To get mad enough to murder
I thought I was to love my brother
And my brother to love me
Dear Lord

[Solomon Childs]
I wake up in the morning
And think about the snakes that I once called my peers
Like fuck that nigga Solomon Childs
Written in my baby Mother's project stairs
(Mob status) Like if I catch this nigga
I'ma put a buck fifty through his beard
You can front all you want but a nigga is feared
Shit if I told you
How just this year alone so many lives was spared
Assassins in front of Ma's twenty-one twelve
And rhino gear, Sippin on a warm beer
Commands comin across radio waves
Like the stupid nigga out here
He drunk, Shit, You want me leave em here
Nah, He aint a threat
He a bit of a self gangsta but far from a threat
And God don't like ugly
So what's comin to them niggas they gone get
Cause they just how my Grandmomma say
Ghetto bastards, With no respect
And they souls just sink and the Devils submit
So Lord I ask
Did I develop this anger from the change in my life's events
Cause I aint feel like this when Nas dropped represent
And my Pops had the cherry red Corvette
Oh well, Whether whatever it is it happened
I ask and pray, You spare my soul from any regrets

[Chorus w/ Solomon Childs ad-libs]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
It's your boy down here, You know
When I was young I aint understand what they meant by
You back a rat into a corner then it'll jump
But now I'm startin to understand, What that mean
All I ask you to do, Is bless the families
Of those brothers that keep pushin me</pre>
