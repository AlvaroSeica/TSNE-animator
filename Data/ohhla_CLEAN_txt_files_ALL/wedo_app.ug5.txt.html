[The Nope]
Why you don't like us, {?}
I'm snackin on some Idahos that come from the ground
Every time I make a sound, bugs goes 'round
I hear a bunch of flowin dub and it bugs me
Don't work me in a good {?} who doesn't love me
A lot of people deep inside is just ugly
You don't know how we... we so lovely
I mean our favorite {?} wanna get cuddly
Cause we the motherfuckin N.O., don't pretend though
That you don't wanna give us props, suck my cyclops
Until it's all dry dotch
That's what you get if you got a soft set
So, remember in the future
That when The Nope come you better raise the roof up
The rap industry is a major goof up
You paid to do stuff, your haters ain't major
Every player you suck
You're just proof that you got some goop on your tooth bruh
Use a toothbrush
I surf, nigga on some Blue Crush
So once again you can suck the dick or two nuts

Yeah, be positive they say
With artists in my way, you hotter than {?} try not to think
I'm not the thinking man's rapper
I don't rap for any man, I'm the man rapper, think!
Since you got first, second and unleaded
Wouldn't go ride a rental with just letters
You can't make salad if you use just lettuce
And just cause you can go fast you're not expressive
Don't be mad at a man cause you're expressive
She had to move on he was just open and just catch it
Either that or he throwed her the bone and she just fetch it
So you can call her a bitch but you bet you just jealous
Betoch, watch, we the best fellas
We get on the stage and only just wreck it
