[Chorus 1: Solomon Childs]
Get your hands dirty nigga stop frontin uh-uh-uh

Get your hands dirty nigga touch somethin uh-uh
If you not gettin it then stop frontin uh-uh
Take'n over the strip get blocks pumpin uh-uh
Uhh-uh uh, Uhh-uh-uh Uhh-uh uh
Get your hands dirty nigga touch somethin uh-uh
If you aint gettin money then stop frontin uh-uh
Take'n over the strip get the blocks pumpin
If you aint gettin bread nigga stop frontin uh-uh

[Solomon Childs]
Promoters say I'm nice heats, Overseas nice with the beats
Brilliant with gats, Brilliant on tracks
Who said the East Coast aint spittin it niggas is bringin it back
Niggas is dry clothes change'n when the rain hit em
Here we here we here we go (Get em) nigga hit em
Time to get one wit em, Boss crime
You know what it is, Renegade, All mine
Chrysler doors, Suicide whores
Turn round the frame, Street cred grain
Crystallize, Top Gun niggas is all around
Niggas don't want it, What, Nah they don't want it
Cause if you aint gettin money nigga stop frontin uh-uh

[Chorus 2: Solomon Childs]
Get your hands dirty nigga touch somethin uh-uh
Get your hands dirty nigga touch somethin uh-uh
Take'n over the strip get the block pumpin
If you aint gettin bread nigga then nigga stop frontin uh-uh

[Solomon Childs]
You only live once, So make sure you die for somethin
Don't go bluffin if the forty aint cocked
Don't take the hit if you aint got the right gwap
Cause whether you get the drop aint no further in frontin hot
Niggas is stupid, You know cause they don't know what's good
But when they see the hammers they go runnin through the hood
Talkin and promote'n how you get it in
Niggas know that they pussy word to my Mothers and friends
I know that it's real, So nigga make sure you feel how you feel
When you back the hammer on them niggas that squeal
And now-a-days chunky ratchets aim accurate
The club bangs, Twenty-fours spin off the roads
Accurate, Niggas is keepin it stuntin uh
So you aint got no bread nigga stop frontin uh-uh

[Chorus 2]
