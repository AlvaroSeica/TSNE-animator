(Verse 1, Slim Thug)
I'm fuckin this game up
Refusin to change up
Keepin in gangsta
Stayin the same thug
You see me up in the club, you see me up in the hood
You see me with a bad bitch, flippin in somethin good
They want me to fall off, but I'm a Hogg dogg
I love gettin money, yeah, I want it all dogg
Got outlaw ways, never follow the rules
I live my life like a boss, I done paid my dues
They wanna be in my shoes, just to see how it feel
To walk it like you talk it, only speak what's real
Makin mills off songs, I'm fuckin this game up
Grindin my ass off, gettin my change up

(Hook)
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, I never change up
Sit back and watch me, look how it came up
I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
Yeah, I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
To this hustlin, I ain't no stranger
Niggas be jealous, that's why I ride with the banger
I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
Yeah I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
I'm fuckin this game up

(Verse 2)
Some say we payin dues, we call it earnin stripes
Had some warm days, plenty cold nights
You push that cocaine, get that cold ice
So gamble with the hustle, go head and roll dice
When niggas crap out, that's when they tap out
But if I fall, you can catch me at the trap house
Tryin to get it back, til I'm spendin rats
Palms itchin in the kitchen, gotta get 'em scratched
Niggas bitches livin fiction, but this shit is fact
Nothins free and nothins givin, so we pitchin crack
My nigga, time's hard, babies need food
Them fiends on the 'vard, you know what I'ma do

(Hook)
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, I never change up
Sit back and watch me, look how it came up
I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
Yeah, I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
To this hustlin, I ain't no stranger
Niggas be jealous, that's why I ride with the banger
I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
Yeah I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
I'm fuckin this game up

(Verse 3)
Homie it's one of them nights I let my blades chop, top dropped, remeniscin
Marvin Gaye, playin low, homie take a listen
On a mission tryina make it to the top
But it seems that a bunch of niggas wanna see me stop
How bout I never flop and give them haters any shine
I'm  on the grind homie, focused on mine
Stayin in my lane, I suggest you do the same
Fuckin up my change and I let you feel the pain
City lights shine as the blunt burn
In a daze, gettin blazed as the world turn
Never change up, tryina get my name up
Goin hard and I'm fuckin all the game up

(Hook)
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, I never change up
Sit back and watch me, look how it came up
I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
Yeah, I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
To this hustlin, I ain't no stranger
Niggas be jealous, that's why I ride with the banger
I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
Yeah I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
I'm fuckin this game up

(Verse 4)
Sit back and watch me, no they can't stop me
They hate on a nigga still, I'm thinkin they Nazi
I'm steamin it's rockly, bitch look like roxy
Top on the coupe gone, coppers look cocky
Boss Hogg Outlawz, a fuckin monopoly
We serve and collectin, snatchin everything foxin
We fuckin this game up, watch how they change up
They tryina ride our lane, fall back hang it up
You suckas ain't trill as I, yeah it's solidified
I'm came from the bottom bitch, I made it through genocide
Now I'm off in them rides, seein new dreams n shit
Hoppin out fresh with the meanest bitch

(Hook)
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, I never change up
Sit back and watch me, look how it came up
I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
Yeah, I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
To this hustlin, I ain't no stranger
Niggas be jealous, that's why I ride with the banger
I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
Yeah I'm fuckin this game up (Fuckin this game up)
