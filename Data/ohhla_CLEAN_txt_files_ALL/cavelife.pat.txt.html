Song:   Cave Life
Typed by: @PatMaine

(Verse 1)
Kinnetik where'd you learn rock, rock rock, said I was born in cave
and I make break beats with rock rock, rock break then I rap on acoustic wave
Cave man raised, sun moon praise
Suit made from what I couldn't fit on my food plate
Gotta tool made for defending mine
Jewelry made from an enemies spine
One mans back bone is another mans necklace
Survival makes man kind and man cruel
So one mans body in a million years is another mans fossil fuel

(Chorus)
FOOD FIGHT FUCK
FOOD FIGHT FUCK
FOOD FIGHT FUCK
FOOD FIGHT FUCK
FOOD FIGHT FUCK
FOOD FIGHT FUCK

(Verse 2)
Im from an elevated cave carved out of a rock wall
If enemy came we only had to make rock fall
Boulder stop all, etched it in stone, yet survival's still a lost art
I watch star, keep ear to earth, for a meal to merk
Equipped with instincts and spear that works
Couldn't hear my words, I spoke in grunts
Cave art vocalized for a broken tongue
and I wrote it from, blood and swollen thumbs
A golden sun, told em what the days like
I may write it all in plain light
They look for deeper meaning only complicating cave life

(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
Did I mention I roll in a clan
and we can make fire with just two sticks
Only elements controlled the land
We just give the land a sense of purpose
But then caveman came up with a plan
Now you control the land with just a purchase
But I wanna understand if human values dictate does it make the land worth less
Cause I'm pretty sure since way before we learned to burn shit
FOOD FIGHT FUCK is all we been concerned with,
Sure its time to do righteous stuff, through life and such
but its just food fight and fuck

(Chorus)</pre>
