[Intro]
"Heh, what is this?"
"Maybach Music"
"I like this Maybach Music"
"Sweet~!" {*laughing*}

 [Rick Ross samples]
"Push it to-"
"Everyday I'm-"
"Ten years later time for me to cash out"
"Chickens with me and we standin' at the top"

[Interlude: Napoleon Hill sample]
"Now here are some interesting facts about the mastermind which give you an idea
of how important it is and how necessary that you embrace this principal
and make use of it in attaining success in your chosen occupation
First of all, it is the principal through which you may borrow and use the education
the experience, the influence and perhaps the capital of other people
in carryin' out your own plans in life. It is the principle through which you can accomplish
in one year more than you could accomplish without it in the lifetime
if you depend entirely upon your own efforts for success
There is no such thing as something for nothing.
Everything, including your personal success, has a price that must be paid."

[Rick Ross]
I just upped my stock, fuck them cops
If you love hip-hop bust them shots {*gunfire*}
