Song:   Messin' Up My High
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I've been waiting for this song, all night
Sorry if I can't talk right now..
But you messin' up my high, high high high
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Just turn up the music [2x]
Tataturn it up, little higher
I just took a shot, got me feelin wired
I ain't finna talk, I came to shut it down
And I know you're tired with your runnin mouth
So give me 50 feet, please let the speakers break
Nah you don't need to speak or say a thing
cause you messin up the song sorry but your messin up my zone
I've been waiting for this song, all night
Sorry if I can't talk right now..
But you messin' up my high, high high high
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Just turn up the music [2x]
Super high, [?]
Buzz kill, why you tryna bring me down
Shoe fly, cause I'm too fly
Talkin out yo ass, too fly
I don't care what the word is
I'm sittin high on the plan no service
You're breaking up like a girl do
No I ain't tryna be rudee
I've been waiting for this song, all night
Sorry if I can't talk right now..
But you messin' up my high, high high high
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Just turn up the music [2x]
Sorry I ain't tryna have a conversation right now
Just tryna hear the music with the speakers up loud
feel good on the high ain't tryna come down
I just need you to turn up the volume turn up the volume can you turn up the volume ugh
I've been waiting for this song, all night
Sorry if I can't talk right now..
But you messin' up my high, high high high
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Don't wanna hear what your talkin bout
Just turn up the music [2x]</pre>
