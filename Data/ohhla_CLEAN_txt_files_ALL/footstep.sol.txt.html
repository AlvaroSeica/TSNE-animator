[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Ok, yeah, yeah, Heroin
Stop fucking saying my name, these niggas know who the fuck I am

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
These footsteps of life, these footsteps of life
My footsteps of life, you live it the way you wanna live it
You only get to live one life
My footsteps of life, these footsteps of life
These footsteps of life, you live it the way you wanna live it
You only get to live one life

[Solomon Childs]
I look up, and I thank the Lord, that I breathe another day
I saw A-Rod and Barry Bonds, hit homeruns in the same day
A part of history, a bomb barade
I stay in all black like N.W.A.
The East Coast's illest delivery, certified in the pave
Poverty's Hell's Kitchen, the mack 11 equivalent to the lyrics I'm spitting
R.I.P. to Stack Bundles, another hip hop soul is missing
That's why I keep one in the head for them snakes that hissing
Nowadays who do I trust, the marijuana made it too clear
I be 28 this year, and I'm already getting grey hairs
No elevators to slice with the stairs
I'm setting out to make it
Whether how many times I fail, our Messiash's never scared
Just put on more metal gear

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
I was brought up in the era of Rakim
EPMD fisherman hats, my old man at the race tracks
Vials of crack, Dolomite movies versus The Mack
Alligator skin British Knights
Rusty housing pipes, Sergio jeans and tights
Bruce Lee, put your lighters in the air
My real niggas support this
ThunderCats, He-Man, G.I. Joe, Jim
V-I-N, the big cellies, the E-tonics
I wanted my waves to spin like Mike Kelly's
Gold fronts like Kenny Hawk, when I spoke
I wanted niggas to move like I was Inf in Mahoney's Park
Shoot at them rasta boys like I was James Dale
I had my Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin hat and the cup
From Burger King, WBLS button, my Batman ring
Remember mama cried, when Marvin Gaye died
And they put his pops in handcuffs on the news
Ricky Shroder was the star of Silver Spoons
Hard floors, no carpets in my room
Sunday school, scuffs on my church shoes, flat tops and half moons
Wiffleball bat dues, Pat Benatar grooves, Rest in Peace
To my cousins, Jerry Lynwood and Gumba
Til I see you, shine doula

[Chorus]</pre>
