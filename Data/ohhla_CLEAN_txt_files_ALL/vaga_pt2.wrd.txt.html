Ok I'm back it is me you want to listen to
Underground rapper with awards in his living room
Skipping to a real hot beat with a spit or two
Listen you, this is new, its Scotland's speech
Its getting through, putting crews, right on their ass man
They just lying like there Azlan 
Damn can, I just kick it? Yeah I can-can
Sipping on a can while I'm ripping on the fan-dans
(Calm fam) Nah man, I've no time for the nonsense
Cheap little gimmicks or a whole lack of content
Hold back constant, take things and cross them
Out, because I shouldn't talk about what my thoughts bring
But this time I'm addictive as white lines
To those that nose if you know I'm quite kind
I'm like nice. one of a kind if it is on mic's
I'm kind of like the opposite of that in real life

Punch line raps dead (no it's no) resuscitate (breath)
Bring it back to life (ha) you'll be lucky mate
Calling on the ambulance, I'll save you I can manage this
Can't save yourself, because you don't know where the manual is
Raj-manina devil, I grab you're cranium levels
I'm getting blood out a stone, I'll stab the stain out a pebble
Fuck myself to boiling point I'll shag my name out a kettle
The rebel take it to the level where my name is in medals
See I'm the prize you can win, I set their eyes in a spin
Drooling at my feet they drop saliva-at my shin
Eat you're IQ for breakfast and cook a Steven Fry-up
And tie up the damn guy because my dictionary lies shut
Itching to be Scottish and I call it bonnie rash
I'm looking for a woman but they fucking always nash
Burning ring of fire and I'm in you're mummy's ass
She gave me money for some condoms, now that's real Johnny Cash

I'm right back, my rhymes crack, like bad backs
Mad Max teaching all these kids in this matrix 
Face facts, writing every letter like its anthrax
Keeping a note, keep it down, like its Anne Frank's
Damn man all these bands full of damn camp bam's 
Putting jams on their Band-camp, I'm 
Trying to ban whack Stan's, from this land I stand
So my plan is to do it, and do what you can't
And I can damn spit it, no man can kick it
Like I can-can't stand all you're bland crammed lyrics
And my fam damn did it, done rip it every minute
Never quit it, come with it, even night, son kill it
Run with it
