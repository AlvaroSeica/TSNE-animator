Song:   The Duelist
Typed by: @MidaZ

official aficionado
fisherman hat and wallos
fidgety gat for suckers
and filibuster the 5 0

no duelist should ever go fuck with lion o
me and my tribal shift thigh bones to spinals

fuck combing beards
escape in front of the overseers
wearing bombs telling them to come near us
they fear us
something like deers and spears
thats why they jeer and prick they ears
when the word hits the wires niggas is here
its crystal
but where I'm from cause its crystal don't mean its clear
but you see it
I'm like a deacon
a beacon of light for peers
beast speaking in tongue
with his tongue speaking in mouth
till his mouth leap from his face
and his face fall in his hands
and his fingers start up that glowing
he learned from sookie the fairy
a force emits from his glands
that at night can light up the prairie
fairly or unfairly he's treated wearily
rarely does he disappear where they don't ask where is he
he's wearing jeans
at local nightclubs scaring teens
he will ferrel
and piss excellent kerosene
old bear ghyrllz
no berenstein bear
long as he stack bills
don't care for clean hair
never once he posed for stills
plus he's killed
its real
you know the filled landfill he last seen there</pre>
