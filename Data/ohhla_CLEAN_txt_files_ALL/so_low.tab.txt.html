Song:   So Low
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro - Noisettes "Sometimes" samples]
"Sometimes, we start over"
"Just go solo..." (Yeah, I like that)
"No metaphors, are needed from"
(Snap your fingers, you can do it all by yourself)
"This time onwards"
(You can do it all by yourself)

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
I can go so low
I can feel the gravity that's in the world around me
I can go so low
I can feel the fire burnin as it swirls around me
And I've been so low
I've felt ice cold in hours at the bottom of the sea
Might have been so low
You might did low get low but you never been as low as me

[Talib Kweli]
I always speak for the struggle my people still hurtin
I'm a name brand, I'm a product but still a real person
I'm still flirtin with death although I'm still certain
about my commitments in life, although I'm still searchin
I better find a way, if not I better make a path
And one that's seldom traveled by the masses
I never stuck in all the traffic, I cut through all the plastic
Enemies of the enlightened like the government is fascist
I talk it how I live it yet I'm still considered a walkin contradiction
Cause I'm breakin out of your artistic prison listen
I got my own demons, what I'm supposed to do with yours
Times like this I gotta remind myself what I do it for
People I knew before celebrity, swear they see the change in me
I tell 'em change is God, you gotta let it be
How does it feel to come full circle?
Still cursin, still pursin my lips to pull purple but

[Talib Kweli]
Yeah, yo
You witnessin, the building of a legacy
So let us just pray cause the journey that's ahead of us
got us facin a task that just might get the best of us
That's why we gotta clash with the Titans like Pegasus
No Oedipus, but it's like the beat is my therapist
When I let it in it get up in the cracks and the crevices
of my memories.. what kind of treasure are you buried with?
You fight when you die are you a soldier or a terrorist?
Remember this, there's no one else to blame when you're solo
Establish your fan base local, before you take it global
Don't be scared to spend your own dough
You gotta speak up be vocal
Sometimes you feel so low, ain't nowhere to go but up, go with us
We just gettin started, why you slowin up?
But know enough to know, this was done by the collective we
Even if my name is on the record sleeve, I ain't into brevity
The fuck is a celebrity?

[Chorus]</pre>
