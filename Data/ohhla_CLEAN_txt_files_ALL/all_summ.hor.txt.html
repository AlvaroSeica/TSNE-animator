[Chorus 1: 2X]
Summer sun on my windowsill
I sit and think and wonder
You know that I miss you still
Though we were never lovers

[Solo]
You hear that girl? The rain's pouring
Soundtrack to our forgotten story
Reminisce sometimes, seeing the world through love's eyes
Your friend was my sunshine
till I realised you eclipsed her
Now I miss ya
Never together, we wished it so but
whatever the weather, you kept me afloat
My first kiss landed right here
Shit, haven't thought about that in years
Now it's all coming back so clear
Ghosts in my past
Lying with the phone in the dark
Talking shit just to hear you laugh
Wild horses are what you told me
till we drift apart

[Chorus 2: 2X]
And I still think of your face
every time it rains and I wonder
In a different time and place
could we find a way to one another

[Solo]
I was cleaning out my room, found a note that you wrote me
Said "I hope we can be together one day" like a label mate
but some things don't stay the same
And I saw you just the other day, we didn't have much to say
but when I touched your arm, you begun to spark
For a split second, it's like nothing's changed
Now I'm not saying we would've worked but
who's to say if we put in work, and we
could'nt have made something real
Reminisce on the way that you made me feel

And I just wanted to let you know
that I never meant to let you go
I just wanted to let you know
that I never meant to let you go
I just wanted to let you know
that I never meant to let you go
I just wanted to let you know
that I never meant to let you go
And it goes

[Chorus 1: 2X]

[Solo]
Said I just want you to know
that you were so beautiful
Said I just want you to know
that you were so beautiful
Said I just want you to know
that you were so beautiful to me
Said I just want you to know
that you were so beautiful to me
Said I just want you to know
that you were so beautiful to me

I just wanted to let you know
that I never meant to let you go
I just wanted to let you know
that I never meant to let you go
I just wanted to let you know
that I never meant to let you go
I just wanted to let you know
that I never meant to let you go

I just wanted to let you know
that I never meant to let you go
My heart's like a metronome, it beats strong in my chest
giving me "A New Hope" like the Fourth Episode
I guess we'll never know
But I just wanted to, I just wanted to
I just wanted to let you know
that I never meant to let you go

Whoa-oh (whoa-oh)
