Wellllll.. BREAK THE WALLS DOWN!
It's the Big Show - and Jericho, you know we got you
C'monnnn.. LET'S BREAK THE WALLS DOWN!
For those about to rock, I'm what you want
Baby you know you're Judas, and I'm your Priest
Baby what I got is not from the least
Bring it to the stage in the rage of the beast

It's the Big Showwwwww
It's a big, bad show tonight
Yeahhhhh! It's a Big Show
Crank it up and turn on the liiiiights
Oh yeahhhhh!

You're wakin from a deep sleep, you're all weak
You're livin in the agony, of defeat!
I am the master of your whole heap
I am the pastor, flock you like sheep!
Step into the town and break the walls down
Your heartbeat is the only sound
Step into the light, and then you'll know
You were stopped and dropped by the Walls of Jericho

It's the Big Showwwwww
And I've come to set things riiiiight
Yeahhhhh! It's a Big Show
Whose gonna burn this house toniiight
Oh yeahhhhh!
Your time is over, your time's come around
Hold you high above me, then plant you in the ground!!!

Wellllll.. BREAK THE WALLS DOWN!
It's the Big Show - and Jericho, you know we got you
C'monnnn.. LET'S BREAK THE WALLS DOWN!
It's the Big Show - and Jericho, you know we got you
C'monnnn.. LET'S BREAK THE WALLS DOWN!</pre>
