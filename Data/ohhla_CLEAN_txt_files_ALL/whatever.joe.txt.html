Whatever it takes, to find a way
to find a way
to find a way
I'ma do whatever it takes, to find a way
to find a way
to find a way
I'ma do, Whatever it takes to find a way
to find a way
to find a way
Whatever it takes to find a way

to find a way
to find a way

Aiy, I'm dealing with some shit homey, it's in the back of my head
and it's some shit homey, but I just rap it instead
see I got wolverine bones in me
but the whole world is throwin stones at me like they all gotta bone with me
got a child's mother, and I hate her to death
but that's my child's mother, so that's my mate to the death
that's why how I love her for puttin little me here
and me and huck'll beef forever, she gon still be there
and there's some other niggaz, I just a character role
be they some other niggaz, now let's get back to the song
I got a drug problem, but I ain't tell the truth
because I got enough problems
and my solution is to stuff problems
but if something goes wrong with that
then it's back to pcp and solong with rap
see I'm depressed lately, but nobody understands
that I'm depressed lately, I'm sorta feeling repressed lately
but y'all been hearin and seein me less lately
like it's anyone noticed the redress lately
look deep nigga don't I seem stressed lately
seem disturbed, alot of repress lately
I got a company that I'm signed to
but they ain't in my company, when all I need is some company
when I start feelin like everybody's done with me
I tryna see what everybody want with me
then the mistress, yeah, the girl from ten minutes it's hard
now I'm needing ten minutes from heart
I can't get into it, but I want y'all to know
that I'll get into it, but I'll save that for the growth
then it's rap beef, but I'm so secure with me
it's only rap beef, I don't need se-cu-rity (never)
wanna get at me, wanna go to war with me
that's just one phonecall for me
check the shit, I got a whole hood, that don't appreciate
it's not the whole hood that appreciates me
what you gon tell me, when it's the streets that made me
and I won't let the belly of the beast degrade me
and then it's rap critics, they say all I make dance music
but there almost anything you can dance to it
they ain't like the single, so they ain't copped that album
wouldn't give a chance to it, not a second glance to it
they say he wines to much, he's too bitter
they call it complaining, I call it explaining
I know 'em niggaz cooked it, caught up in the gaming
lose they mind and y'all call it entertainment
some shit with me, a dude's been knew that
but I'm gambling a lot and I ain't used to do that
rap ain't payin the bills, it's mo money mo problems
or it's no money mo problems
all enormous when you play at these stakes
that's how it feels to have a warrant on a famous face
then the album's pushed back, cause they say he needs a single at the moment
but what he needs is a single moment
then I'm involved in the 'he say she say (that)
send my mind on replay, each day
then it's the bullshit that she save he's gave
cause she wouldn't like to think that he ain't like her
just cause she was throwing it at me and I ain't touch her
she'll say anything psych, but I ain't wanna fuck her
I don't feel good, so I won't wanna go to a club
don't wanna go to a lounge, just wanna lounge
then the same sweatster that I had on for days
the same t I had on for a week what I got on, it speaks
what I got on, it reeks
no shape up, chilling, cause that's just how I'm feeling
and one day at a time, it's god willing
tryna see scrape but the fall keeps building
post start raising, the booze starting that gate me
but I gotta be a king cause this wolve's tryna play me
goodie when it's hot like it's freezing winter
bed start, eating sleep for dinner
then it's hard tryna keep this in ya
so I write it all down, so one day maybe when life is all sweet I remember
then it's probation, I know we all go through it
we call it probation, but there's no pro to it
yeah my soul's aching, only a few peers know
funny thing about the case is it's a few years old
had some shit going on with my ohh, that felt good but it's bad
so I'm sitting here like what the bitch had
it's not rap it's real, look scrappy it's true
going what's popping, do he look happy to you
now if it goes to the wire, go the soul of a fighter
bruised up and sloppy, a damaged like Ali
up late talking to the fans on a website
that's the only thing that send yo man off to bed right
fuck the world fuck my moms and my girl

well maybe not mom, just let me remain calm
this too won't last, this too shall pass
at least that's what I say yall, that's what I pray for
and I'm the only thing that's standing in my way yall
but I gotta be with me, it's no escape yall
I guess depression just stepped in, and took over shit like it's known to do
Guess it said, hey Joe, I'm going home with you
Turn your phone off, I need to be alone with you
I need to be in the zone with you
Cuz I'm the only thing y've grown to, nigga
Look, I own you, nigga
Been with you since 10, but you starting to confuse me
cause it's been so long and you still tryna lose me
Like how could you show me such cruelty
When everybody turns their back on you, Joe it's you and me
Still you don't want me to see you right
And why you always come get me, how we re-unite
huh, I know you feel for me deep in your heart
Doctors, meetings, pills couldn't keep us apart
What, now, you got a deal and you wanna get rid of me
We roommates, I'm in your head, Joe you live with me
So I don't write for the fans, nah, I write to my man
And hope that he'll just leave and understand
Like, like please leave the kid in peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace
Just leave for a second, man it's been too long, and I can't troop it
And as long as you around I can't make that dance music

Whatever it takes, to find a way
to find a way
to find a way
whatever it takes, to find a way
to find a way
to find a way
I'ma do whatever it takes, to find a way
to find a way
to find a way
Whatever it takes, to find a way
