[Verse 1 - Ms. Jade (Ms. Jade singing)]
Ain't no other girl girl
Rub it in for the whole world world

Try'n show off thinkin they can move me
(Here we go again) one time
(Never take me off my grind)
and I do it true true
Do me is my number one rule rule
Look I'm grown grown
Haters I'm leavin 'em long gone gone
Got 'em with they (hands up high)
Twisted at the bar I'm feelin (all right)
Show 'em (what they need to ride)
Dancin til they feet hurtin (all night)
cause I stack cheese cheese
I'm whatever its gonna be be
Uh, and its all to the good
Never been Hollywood cause I stand for the hood
Its a different (day now)
Watch how I'm makin the game (break down)
See me doin it it

Uh, Philly chick get it down
If the flood is comin I promise I ain't gon' drown

and I got got g-got my eyes on the prize

[Chorus - Ms. Jade &amp; Timbaland]
Get your big head on the floor

You ain't ever seen me move like this
Get your big head on the floor

You ain't ever seen me groove like this
Get your big head on the floor

You ain't ever seen me move like this
Get your big head on the floor

You ain't ever seen me groove like this

[Verse 2 - Ms. Jade (Ms. Jade singing)]
We done did it now now
Why don't you put your money on me now now
Make you feel free free

From the sky to (house parties)
Sippin martinis under the (palm trees)
You can light it up up
Sick ceiling leave niggas thugs thugs
Whats really goin on on
Partyin to the break of dawn dawn
Uh, switchin lanes in the truck
and we know its gonna catch up but we still gettin drunk
Lets get (rooms for the night)
This a Timb trick so you (know its tight)
Uh, stackin the ching ching
and its obvious I'm gonna get a little vibrant thing
Tear the floor (up in the club)
Rappers (?) with (chicks and the thugs)
Move, from the bottom to the top
Got ya self a gun and get prepared for the glock
Uh, and its all to the love
Twist up your drink get your drink for your mugs
Uh, and its all to the love
Twist up your drinks get your drinks for your buzz

[Chorus x2]

[Ms. Jade + People yelling]
Jade the champ!

Big dreams and hurt feelins call me (Jade the champ!)
I put the weight on my shoulders where other bitchles slack (Jade the champ!)
who else you know could breathe life into a murdered track (Jade the champ!)
I done seen what y'all can do, nevermind that (Jade the champ)
Like to mix old with the new like a Philly throwback (Jade the champ)
Take your best shots I promise I'ma throw back (Jade the champ)
we can take it back to the days of the cadilliac (Jade the champ)
jumps out and handle that heat, candle melt your wax (Jade the champ)
Maybes and  matter facts thats ms jade the fuckin champ (Jade the champ)
play the lower kid you softly like roberta flack (?) (Jade the champ)
and then they, and then they mad cause I'm statin facts (Jade the champ)
and then they, and then they hate when i pop the cap (Jade the champ) 
that old nursery rhymin this shit ain't about that(Jade the champ) 
My flow a mix between 180 proof and six packs (Jade the champ)
Spit circles see if you can get around see if you can get back (Jade the champ)
Before you jump best know exactly who you gettin at (Jade the champ)

[Chorus]
