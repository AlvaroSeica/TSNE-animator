[Intro: M-Speed]
Uh, uh, uh, M-Speed, nigga
Check it out

[M-Speed]
Imagine life darker than this, like NARCs when they shit
When the four sparking my shit, who catching the clip?
Full of this hot shit, ya'll dudes is pussy, bet not pop shit
Make your heart stop quick, come on, this is murder, nigga
Understand that, when it pop, you gon' feel that
I'm from where it's real at, I done made 'em feel that
Heat make 'em splatter, heard you get busy, but uh, it don't matter
Moon hang strictly blood was sweeter than love
Never catch me deep in the club, repeat I'm a thug
And I don't like to conversate, I speak with the slugs
Jube out the streets, and will each you alive
You can go from handling birds and losing your size, uh
Beating your feet, to pushing a 5
I seen it happen to the best of them
Kingpin nigga, but the judge still blessed him
Football numbers, that's what took ya'll under
Let me tell ya'll bout the law, kid, it don't work for poor kids
Black boys on trial, lead to more bids, nigga
No bullshit

[Chorus 3X: M-Speed]
The streets they eat you alive, in due time
And they in jail or death, I seen them nail the best
Some dudes excel, majority, jail
And we all know what that's like, nigga, living hell
Especially when the numbers is high, they hang you to dry
All that can break a man, and take his hand

[M-Speed]
Aiyo, the eyes seen a lot in my time, pay attention, nigga, follow the rhyme
Since a youth, street sucked me in, O.G., nigga, tuck me in
Taught me how to cock and shoot, say give me the loot
Come on this shit is bigger than big, for no reason
I'll split your wig, have people hide at your kid
Ain't nobody seem to be gone, send you his arm
Postal express style, God blessed now
No pride, let him rest in peace, strength of me
I'll promise you ain't seen dude ugly from me
I'm bout to reach out and touch ya'll, cock back and bust ya'll
Been ain't trust ya'll, plus ya'll
Rap dudes is ass cheeks, salute when you pass me
But please don't ask me, nothing at all
I'm a straight gangsta, not fronting for ya'll
Come on, everybody know, industry take money
Plus I'm fucking for free, including your honey
Moon been a dime, since, dinner time
Pinstripe Lee's and Adidas with shells
Osh Kosh jumpers and trays for sale
While ya'll dudes is rapping, hugging the block
Running up in spots, hang hug the block
Huddle with straight murder, and for cream we plot
See the jake when I gleem with no plans to rot
The truth hurts skin deep, you can't wear it if you weak
Fuck a lollipop, ya'll dudes extra sweet
I'mma tell you one time, don't fuck with me

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
