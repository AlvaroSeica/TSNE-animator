Chorus 1

(Pep Love)
I'm the type of mack that's on top of the stack

(Snupe)
And I'm the killa of the wack with no time to react

(Pep Love) 
I make em Holler

(Snupe)
Makin dollars

(Pep Love) 
I'm a scholar

(Snupe)
I'm a prince

(Pep Love)
Since it all makes sense

(Pep &amp; Snupe)
Let's hit some corners in the 'lac 

(Pep Love)
I'm the type of mack that's on top of the stack

(Snupe)
And I'm the killa of the wack with no time to react

(Pep Love) 
I make em Holler

(Snupe)
Makin dollars

(Pep Love) 
I'm a scholar

(Snupe)
I'm a prince

(Pep Love)
Since it all makes sense

(Pep &amp; Snupe)
Lets sip some cogniac


(Pep Love)
I was told the flavor is bold, oh so cold
Its gonna get hotter than the equator, when this dream is sold
To you (you)
This is how we bring the old (old)
To the new (new)
And make it turn into gold (gold)
Heads up, when I said stuff, that had'em mesmerized 
Speaking on the Hiero enterprise 
We mega, and vicious, magnificent
And bitches always be on the dick and shit
Cause we was doin it when you were not
Always coming through blue off a big shot
Wondering, when will this bullshit stop, in hip hop
Niggas pop lip
Really need to get their lip popped 
Didn't you know in the O-A-K-land
Is the source of the force, indivisible by man
And of course the shit don't stop
Isn't it an event, when we give it all we got 
I'm driven to gain dividends
Financially, substantial
And we shant be stopped
When the beat drop, we chop game
High octane, got it locked
So press delete 
On that thought that you had 
To test the elite
We vested, or your destiny
Will manifest in a spilt second
We takin' it to the extent
With earthquaking shit

Chorus 2

(Snupe)
I'm the type of mack that's on top of the stack

(Pep Love)
And I'm the killa of the wack with no time to react

(Snupe) 
I make em Holler

(Pep Love)
Makin dollars

(Snupe) 
I'm a scholar

(Pep Love)
I'm a prince

(Snupe)
Since it all makes sense

(Pep &amp; Snupe)
Let's hit some corners in the 'lac 

(Snupe)
I'm the type of mack that's on top of the stack

(Pep Love)
And I'm the killa of the wack with no time to react

(Snupe) 
I make em Holler

(Pep Love)
Makin dollars

(Snupe) 
I'm a scholar

(Pep Love)
I'm a prince

(Snupe)
Since it all makes sense

(Pep &amp; Snupe)
Lets sip some cogniac


(Snupe)
Your contaminated stand is taken for granted 
Catered to the uncontended, faded and handed
To the next MC stranded, makin em mad quick
Of these undercover bandits, flakin like dandruff
Fuckin' your man stiff
Stuck in his Stan Smith
Reluctant to the crew 
Mr. Lee, and if you think I just do
The same as these gambling gimmicky MC's 
You don't know my name
I'm in it to please
In available, the stellar flow 
Wherever we go
Within minutes with ease 
And we simultaneously straining these MC's 
Cause we Hiero 
Claiming us is pain for free
By poetic caricature 
Your flows pathetic, still embarrassing your
So called know all
And the richness, of my diversity compels 
All the bitches, to come and pop at me and Pep
I give a gentle thrusting style of lyricism that your into
And what seems like Hieroglyphics wisdom is a pinto
Adjusting, fundamentally until the scratches 
I'm matchless
So I kick back with scotch and smoke
So drop the coke 
We gotcha so watch the choke
Leave ya hot like va-cotcha dough
And if she's not then we got the mo'
On the back so I get another fishnet stocking hoe
