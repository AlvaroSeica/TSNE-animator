Typed by: King Kane

[Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory sample]
Oompa Loompa, doompadah dee
If you are wise you'll listen to me
Oompa Loompa, doompadee doo
I've got another puzzle for you
You will live in happiness too
Like the Oompa Loompa doompadee do, doompadee do
Oompa Loompa doompadee do, doompadee do
Oompa Loompa doompadee do

[Intro: Apocalipps]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, what?
I got the chocolate!
Come on... yeah, let's go
Come on... yo

[Apocalipps]
Yo, if your razor's broke, and your gat wont spin
Then you gon' have to put some Barry Bonds back work in
Or the big dagger, rock'n roll, the Mick Jagger
Unless you got a dead arm punch like Marv Haggler
Yup, it's Apocalipps, I'm up in the building
Alright, this rhyme here may not be suitable for children
I used to stash crack in the benches
Now you can catch me backstage, weeded, givin your favorite rapper the business
And if you gonna cop weight, make sure to cop heavy
And if I'm rhyming on air, if you're smart your have your tapes ready
Besides that I'm on the block heavy
But I suplex your little record label like Brock Lesnar
I had to step it up from the techs and pop desy's
Nigga, stop smoking that wet, and cop berry
The blackberry's in effect, I can't fuck with the cellies
I catch your ass on the boat, I throw you off the Ferry
I got a bad posture, but my flow is proper
Niggas be knowin, Jesse Owens style, I run through your roster
Long dreadlocks, smoke pot, but I'm not a rasta
Lead's hot, red dot, I can spot an imposter
I'm like a octopus, cause I got extra arms
Ruthless, I give a fuck, nigga, I stretch your moms, what!

[Chorus: Apocalipps]
God damn, why you say that, fam?
Cause the fire I spit, burn down happyland
Apocalipps, why you thrash me and my mans?
Nigga, the fire I spit, burn down happyland
Shit, losing that battle wasn't part of the plan
Cause the fire I spit, burn down happyland

[Apocalipps]
Yo, watch how I ride on this beat with no bike
Automatic weapon in the hooptie, got no lights
I rap too much, people say I rap a lot, check it
Scar on my Face, so I should sign to Rap-A-Lot records
I came from the, pits in the cells, to the strips making cells
If that nigga is hot, then Lipps is hell
And I ain't got no time to teach all you MCs grammar
So many guns, my name should be MC Hammer
A lotta bitches say a nigga look like Busta Rhymes
Nah, I'm his cousin, bitch, Bust-a-Nine
I got the master key to this game, now watch me lock it
And you don't have to have on pants, for me to play you out your pockets
Now what, kid, do what you want, and get your crew amped
Apocalipps, I'm known to lick shots, y'all niggas lick stamps
Fuck you and yours, my round of applaud will get you clapped up
Ya niggas is SSA, ass backwards, whaaat!
I do you dirty like the sewers
I smash "Mike's" like Evander, Buster and Lennox Lewis

[Chorus]</pre>
