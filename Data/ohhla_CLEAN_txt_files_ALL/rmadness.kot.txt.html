Song:   Reefer Madness
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

all my friends are stoners everyone I know gets high
maybe there's a reason why weed's not legalized

[Richter]
why people always be afraid of what they don't know
I understand can't comprehend the infos so old
the reefer madness video is purely propaganda
a movie made to scare all of the kids in alabama
maybe they're afraid to think that they might lose control
Instead of embracing it's many uses performing the medical
It's all pathetic though a pharmaceutical company
can make you feel high than low
It seems it's all about the money
funny cause

[Chorus]
all my friends are stoners everyone I know gets high
maybe there's a reason why weed's not legalized
maybe they're afraid of too much peace and harmony
maybe they're afraid of open minds and people free

no rest upon my feet until my people free
when they turn the ganja plant into an evil weed
It's reefer madness

[Dirtball]
check this
so many friends that I know have suffered the lies the governments strangle
Into the ground illegal bound in every angle
even the lawmakers making the laws are smoking the bong and vapin the chronic
and nobody hearing the voice of the weed I find it ironic
so how do we govern the danger of not becoming to hostile
not losing the mind not crossing the line not feeling colossal
there's only one avenue we can be sure that we getting our justice
the legalization of it, of the weed, they tryin' ta bust us

[Chorus]

[Daddy X]
we got a black president before weed's legal
In my mind in my time that shits unbelievable
I love obama I love all people
I just can't believe that the plants not legal
a plant, a seed, that grows in the soil
and they're still fightin' bloody wars over oil?
reefer madness is useless propaganda
fear is the tool that they use to command us
so understand us we don't fear no plant
we don't fear no plant

[Chorus]</pre>
