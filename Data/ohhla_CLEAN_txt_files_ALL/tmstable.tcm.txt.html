[T.R.U.-L.I.F.E.]
As time stretches, sketches of a blood drenched cross
Flood my thoughts, my heart feels pain for the lost
They remain their own boss, play but the games' lost
Not jus anyone can hang to pay what it cost unblemished
Arms hang from East to West, said "It's finished"
Sin got rocked, when the Love stepped in it
Christ got pound, in town center like it was Greenwich
Now my ex-girl the world only wants to chase spinach
And keep her rims spinnin, yeah they shinnin but listen
Huh, we're dinnin wit death, jus as long as we're livin
Contradiction, I think not, the Bible's non-fiction
And life is but a vapor, wiped away wit omniscience
What will you answer be to a God who's risen
Wit all power, your hour is comin trust you wont miss it
Or better yet it wont miss you
I promise, my God is the bombest, what He says come true
And He said through men wit pens
That if I believe in the Son Jesus Christ, I can get back to Him
Through one man came sin, the other came life
The first man was Adam, the last man was Christ

[Chorus]
One plant, one race, one life, one cross
One sin, one end, cause Man was lost

One Father, one Son, one Spirit and all
Men must come through Him, cause thats what it cost

[T.R.U.-L.I.F.E.]
You'll be judged like Ito, light or the heat yo
Despite what you think, to Christ there's no equal
Chose eternal life or crash and burn like Kenievel
They all fall down, when to ball is the steelo
He'll back will you leave as one of His people
Or be stuck, cause your tried to push a camel through a needle
I couldnt imagine what had to happen
A father turned His back on His Son
Let Him take the wrath and smashed Him
His life lad down, equals love everlastin
I'm hype on grace now it far exceeds cheddar stackin
I got better backin from a smaller label
My stomach is full, I dont eat from the kings table

[Chorus]</pre>
