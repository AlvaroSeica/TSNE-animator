[Verse One:  Cam'Ron] (Woman speaking to Cam'Ron)
Yo, girl, get a notepad 
(For what?) You ain't got no swag
And you so fine, it's so sad
Still ridin coach, need a Coach bag
Let me coach you, no Coach tags 
(What that mean?) Get rid of that Coach bag!
And listen, I ain't tryin to throw jabs
(Fuck you Cam!) Why you gettin so mad?!
Only one that deal with Cam is a queen
Louis handbags, Alexander McQueen
Yeah, stand up I'm mean, For how I handle my team 
Clean, Harlem niggas don't wear sandals with jeans
Car skills good, I can handle the Beam
Nickle, dime, twenties, I can handle the fiends
So, hey Muma, que pasa?
I'm water, baby agua

[Chorus: Vado]
AIYYO MUMA!!!!! 
I'm sayin, can I come over? 'Cause I'm not playin
Bend your ass over, uh, I'm not waitin
Doubt if I'm sober Uh! I'm blazin

[Verse Two: Vado]
(HEY!) Hold up (*spit sound*) let the slime spit
Need these first three rows let my suave sit
Icey, make it hard to see the time tick
Me and my dine chicks, with glasses of wine lit
Yeah, your money can't provide this
Hi miss the answer's yes your Highness
Try this! Only I can supply this
Reply this, you'll always see me in fly shit
Shit! If I don't know you I hope not to
Tryin to play a tough role I'm like not you
Earl Boykins I'm D Rose I got you!
Under the sun is where we pose we hot duke
WOO!!! It's what I did to the booth
How I spend in the Coupe are you and members salute
I'm a keep it trill I'm that nigga livin proof
Tellin me to chill is like stoppin Kemba to shoot

[Chorus: Vado]
AIYYO MUMA!!!!! 
I'm sayin, can I come over? 'Cause I'm not playin
Bend your ass over, uh, I'm not waitin
Doubt if I'm sober Uh! I'm blazin
AIYYO MUMA!!!!! 
I'm sayin, can I come over? 'Cause I'm not playin
Bend your ass over, uh, I'm not waitin
Doubt if I'm sober Uh! I'm blazin

[Verse Three: Cam'Ron]
In the hood where I creep tryin to hook me a freak
Want to see what girl around here could put me to sleep
Could mean a hotel, could mean a suite
Could mean tuition, could mean a Jeep
God damn is what the hoochies say
When we jump out of Lambo's
Car, neck, hand froze
Damn yo! Cameras, stand, pose
Therefore, watch her Â‘fore Cam rose

[Verse Four: Vado]
She got down, I'm tryin get the top
Me, Lee, Grip and chop
How to hit the block, E, weed, piff and rock
Before the DT's get the watch
The neighbors watch, all day switchin spots
I'm in the hood like (MUMA!!!!)
What's really, whats good (FRANK MUELLER!!!)
Gun 50, black hood (SAME SHOOTER!!!!)
Blowin sticky black wood (STRAIGHT RULER!!!)

[Chorus: Vado]
AIYYO MUMA!!!!! 
I'm sayin, can I come over? 'Cause I'm not playin
Bend your ass over, uh, I'm not waitin
Doubt if I'm sober Uh! I'm blazin
AIYYO MUMA!!!!! 
I'm sayin, can I come over? 'Cause I'm not playin
Bend your ass over, uh, I'm not waitin
Doubt if I'm sober Uh! I'm blazin</pre>
