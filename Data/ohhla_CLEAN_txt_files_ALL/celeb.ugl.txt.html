Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, thank you!
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, can't
Look, no, sorry!
Sorry, I can't, I can't, really
Alright! Good to see ya, thank you
Okay, sorry, I gotta go
Check it out
"I wish more people was a lot like me!"

I'm a big celebrity
And I don't know what you've been told
But I think you should be more like me
So I'm gonna tell you what I know
See, you're just an average woman or man
and you shouldn't try to think for yourself
There's things that you can't understand
And I'll bet you could use my help (Of course!)
I'm on TV and radio
And unless I'm mistaken, you're not!
So I've found almost every place I go
There's people just waiting to hear my thoughts
They say I'm a genius, they're right
So take my opinions seriously (Okay?)
I'll tell you how to live your life
Cause I'm a big celebrity

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
I'm a big celebrity
And I don't know what you've been told
But I think you should be more like me
So I'm gonna tell you what I know
I'm a big celebrity
and you've got such a long way to go
If you're gonna be more like me
So I'll tell you what you don't know

[Dizzy Dustin] + (Andy Cooper)
Hey big celebrity, please keep your politics
Your beliefs and your philosophies, all of it (Excuse me?)
Some advice if you wanna stay famous (Yeah)
Don't try to change us, just entertain us (What?)
You're a tabloid headline, a photo op
And now you want the same attention John and Yoko got (Of course, why not?)
And when your album or your movie is a total flop
You'll be redundant like Bobby Brown or Robocop (*GASP*)
So please stop and let me off your guilt trip
I know you made a lot of money and you've milked it (Yeah, well...)
but you're not as smart as you think you are (What?)
So shut your mouth Mr. Movie Star

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
I'm a big celebrity
And I don't know what you've been told
But I think you should be more like me
So I'm gonna tell you what I know
I'm a big celebrity
and you've got such a long way to go
If you're gonna be more like me
So I'll tell you what you don't know

[Briana]
You know, I really do feel empowered.
Goes to show you the power of social activism
We can make a difference, we can and did.
In fact, I heard those creeps are going to get
fired from that Meatshake (I hate those guys!)
That, that "Murdershake" as I like to call it.
(That place is so lame) You know, this isn't
more than just a victory for me, or the protesters.
This is social justice for every cow, chicken
and cucumber. All the animals and vegetables are
vindicated today. (You guys should have burned that all place down.)
Power to the people, power to mother Earth
power to the Veggie-Hut! (*Echoes*)</pre>
