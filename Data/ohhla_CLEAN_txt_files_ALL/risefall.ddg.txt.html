[Andre Nickatina]
Believe me my in raise
No change
How can I have so much lust for the game
I'm so ashamed
No skate
It's too late
I've been a play
How can I have so much lust for the game
I'm so ashamed
No squan
My god
The god of Kahn
How can I have so much lust for the game
I'm so ashamed
All rain
Stuck in the game
With all pain
How can I have so much lust for the game
I'm so ashamed
Beleive me my in raise</pre>
