Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You remember... last November
Or was it October? You was over
Oh it was getting colder
It's the middle of December and as they was burnin wheels were turning
And I was yearning for you
Girl, I'm usually a playa but tonight I'm turning for you oh
Girl I couldn't even speak that night
You remember at the beach that night?
There was no one on the street that night
Rolled up, I was looking like a creep that night
Then you came inside my tent to come and get me in
You whispered and you as if I
Was ready and I wasn't but girl

All I wanna do is take my time with you
So if this love is true
Then you'll wait for the 2 of us

All I wanna do is take my time with you
So can we keep it cool?
Cause baby this is new oh-oh

Wanna be my girlfriend and my lover but I'm just not ready
Wanna be my girlfriend and my lover but I'm just not ready
Wanna be my girlfriend and my lover but I'm just not ready
Oh no I'm just not ready, oh no I'm just not ready

Girl you bout to get me in some drama
Feelin like a storm comin
And I know you're dealing with these problems
And I know there's more coming
And you dealin' how you can
Hope you know I really understand
I just gotta be the realest while I can
Cause it's a little jokers chance
Things spread like cancer
On the Kansas
Baby girl let's ride
Take her to the spot on the top and we never gonna stop
Show me what you got
Never gonna dry
No, we never gon stop
Cause someone that make you last
Don't worry bout them jokers in the class cause he always talkin trash
I'm a put him in the past
In a Beemer and I kinda got it going really fast

All I wanna do is take my time with you
So if this love is true
Then you'll wait for the 2 of us

All I wanna do is take my time with you
So can we keep it cool?
Cause baby this is new

Wanna be my girlfriend and my lover but I'm just not ready
Wanna be my girlfriend and my lover but I'm just not ready
Wanna be my girlfriend and my lover but I'm just not ready
Oh no I'm just not ready, oh no I'm just not ready

I'm cool as the wind blows
Please open up a window
Cause it's hot in here
And it's cold when you're not in here
Your body ridin, got a headache
I'm a lay you down cause my body gettin' heavy
Girl you should drop it like it's hot cause I'm ready
And I'm a lean in, but only if you're let me... oh
Come into my villa like get it
You can be my Krugger like Freddy
Cougar, you ready?
Some you can show me
You can be my friend
You can be my homie
You can call me homie cause I'm really lonely
And we could do it fast or we could do it slowly holy... crap
You don't even know me, on Twitter call me a phony
When it's time you gone, passing your pony up

All I wanna do is take my time with you
So if this love is true
Then you'll wait for the 2 of us

All I wanna do is take my time with you
So can we keep it cool?
Cause baby this is new

Wanna be my girlfriend and my lover but I'm just not ready
Wanna be my girlfriend and my lover I'm just not ready
Wanna be my girlfriend and my lover but I'm just not ready
Oh no I'm just not ready, oh no I'm just not ready</pre>
