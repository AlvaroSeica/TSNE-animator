[Intro - Mannie Fresh] + (Rick Ross)
Okaaaay, I'm reloaded (Ain't expect this)
The homey, Elvis Freshly (Uh, Huuh) and Rick Ross-teen (Nigga)
He Back (I see ya, nigga)
I'm back (I smell that money)
I'm back (Yeah)
I'm back (Talk to me, nigga)
It's nowhere to go

[Hook - Mannie Fresh] + (Rick Ross)
I'm talkin Japanese Denim (Boss), money stuffed in 'em
Got the coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women (Whaaaat)
(All I have in this world (Boss), all I have in this world (Boss)
All I have in this world (Boss), all I have in this world (Boss))
(Boss) Heeeey, I'ma work it on the corner (Yeah), work it on the block (Yeah)
Work it till they love me, baby work it till it's hot (Boss)
(All I have in this world (Boss), all I have in this world (Boss)
All I have in this world (Boss), all I have in this world (Boss))

[Verse 1 - Rick Ross]
I left the ? in the house and I let's my bitch drive
Twenty dischange I goes to this five
No it's not the solid treatment I let's the bitch vibe
Fire up the kush she hit it now this ?
Now imagine how she look with carties and thick thighs
Put her on the payroll 'cuz flat out she get's down
See that ass from the side that's before she sits down
And her mouth get wet as a bottle of Crystal
Niggas lookin at me, pa but I'm packin a pistol
Fuck kicked out, bitch I'm tearin this shit down
Yeah my chevy sittin high so it's hard to get down
Watch that dick standin up, girl it's hard to get down
Got them chickens in the dress so I hardly sit down
Some problem Alphabet Boys get them charges to stick now
Bitch, you ain't gotta guess it's me and Mannie Fresh
You know we gettin money by the way a nigga dress

[Hook - Mannie Fresh]
I'm talkin Japanese Denim, money stuffed in 'em
Got the coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
Heeeey, I'ma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it till they love me, baby work it till it's hot
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world)

[Verse 2 - Rick Ross]
Smokin us a teefer name of the reefer
The cloud so thick pussy nigga I don't see ya
Your hoe so thick pussy nigga she don't see ya
Your hoe so thick pussy nigga she don't need ya
My hoes so thick pussy nigga they ain't nothin
I don't love that hoe pussy nigga there ain't nothin
My money so long his money ain't nothin
My money in front of me his money just frontin
You know the routine in movin a few things
Rollin on two benz in them new blue jeans
Japanese Denim money stuffed in 'em
twenty something cars, motherfucker I'm winnin

[Hook - Mannie Fresh]
I'm talkin Japanese Denim, money stuffed in 'em
Got the coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
Heeeey, I'ma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it till they love me, baby work it till it's hot
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world)

[Verse 3 - Rick Ross]

Sippin on that Remy outside of the club
Got me trippin like I'm Remy outside of the club
Yeah them bitches comin with me I'm shinin like a ?
I don't even think it's tricky just temporary love
Chickens pullin on my shirt I'm just worried about the chains
Tattoos ?
? I debut LeBron James
Came back Mike Vick I buried ya dog brains
Y'all ducks want the birds if not just keep walkin
Got the top down and I'm feelin like Steve Austin
You know the routine still movin a few things
Rollin I'm too biz in them new blue jeans

[Hook - Mannie Fresh]
I'm talkin Japanese Denim, money stuffed in 'em
Got the coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
Heeeey, I'ma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it till they love me, baby work it till it's hot
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
