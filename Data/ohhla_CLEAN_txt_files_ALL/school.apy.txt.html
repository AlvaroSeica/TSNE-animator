Intro cuts : "You know, in school.
Everyone tries their very best to learn good habits
So we're going to try to do the very same thing
As we sing."

Verse 1 (character: Jeff)
All star quarterback, varsity letter, I drive a Jetta
A popular kid, my parents give me all my cheddar
Plus I date Heather, the flyest girl in our school
I got a very large house, with an inground pool
I rock Polo and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, I'm rich
Pompous and arrogant, makin' fun of nerd clicks
You motherfuckin' freaks and geeks are dumb
With ya painted white face, and pierced nose and tongue
I pass my classes with ease and get an "A"
Cheatin. cause if I don't pass, I don't play
I'll shove you in ya locker and I'll get in ya face
Put you in ya place, cause you fuckin nerds are a waste of air
Black clothes, blank stare, died hair
You could die tommorow and nobody would care
I'll push on the floor when all the halls are crowded
But you're just a wimp, whatcha gonna do about it?

[Hook]
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No more detentions no more "F's"
No breath inside your chest.
No more homework, no more books
No more teachers dirty looks
No unpopular, no more cool
No more. school

Verse 2 (character: girl)
Four years of high school, I can't believe its here
My senior year, waitin for the crowd to cheer, at graduation
I haven't decided my occupation, but my major in college is gonna be
communications
I'm nice to everybody in school, whether cool, or uncool. I'm neutral
An outstanding pupil like my teachers say
I never missed a single day
Always on the honor roll, never less than an "A"
I help jocks with their grades, even that jerk Jeff
Who's an ass, but never woulda passed class with an "F"
Kids he picks on are smarter then him, and smaller than him
Never larger or taller than him
But this one kid, named Jay.
That jeff calls gay, and beats up, doesn't look very normal today
So I give a little smile and he gives one back
Then he walks by and reaches into his napsack
I feel like I wanna run, but my whole body's stunned
I can't believe it, but Jay's got a ..

[Hook]

Verse 3 (character: Jay)
My name is Jason, a real big fan of death
I sit back thinkin' of Jeff and I take a deep breath
How'd I'd love to fire 30 slugs into his chest, till nothin' is left
I'm always frustrated with stress, I want respect
Back when I was 6 I'd dissect insects, and spray house pets with Windex
I'm Beelzebub on drugs
The intellect of a David Berkowitz, roamin' on the internet
I'm sick of gettin pushed around bein' clowned
When I'm the most powerful evil being in town
I wake up at 5:30 and stare into space
Walk into my parents room and shoot 'em both in the face
Take a shower get dressed load my weapon for school
Walk thru the hall, step over the large blood pool
On the bus with a semi-automatic in knapsack
Smile on my face, as I sit in the back
Then I step into the building and I almost feel invincible
Wave to the nurse, say hi to the principal
Walk to to my locker, everything seems slow
Then I Jeff. and here we go
Weapons out the bag, people stop speakin', girls shreikin'
I start shootin' rounds till Jeff's chest is bleedin'
His head explodes then I start to reload
Nobody can hurt me now. cause I'm in murder mode
Fire at everybody that's directly in my sight
But layin' on the ground on the somebody is I like
This girl who I've known who's always nice and talks to me
Crawls to me, coughin' up blood and awkwardly
Whispers two words right before her head drops
She opened her mouth and said. "please. stop"
I could never begin to describe the way I felt
I dropped to my knees, turned the gun on myself
And pulled the trigger.
