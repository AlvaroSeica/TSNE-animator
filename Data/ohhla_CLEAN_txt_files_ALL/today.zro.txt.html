(*talking*)
Uh oh, Z-Ro the Crooked
And my mo'fucking brother from another
K-Rino the Wizard, that's right
Oh naw, don't run now nigga
Strap your seatbelt on homeboy, dig these blues

[Z-Ro]
I needed assistance, but I gave help
And carried people on my shoulders, when I could barely cary myself
God love it the cheer forgiver, check out second Corinthians chapter nine
Every ten dollars I had, was really five
Damn near everytime, cause I don't want my people to suffer
But these the same people, love to see my tough times get tougher
I feed em when they're hungry, even though when I'm starving they let me starve
And make fun of me, whenever I'm behind bars
As if I'm robbing and killing man
What's funny is they hate a man, that's trying to do right but they love a villain
The devil is an infection, but God is amoxicillin
The cure is heaven, and life is a sickness that needs healing
K-Rino say I'ma make it, but when
(trying to understand why your life is so troubled, is like chasing the wind)
All I can do, is keep my mind focused on heaven above
And remember, the Lord chastises the ones that he love

[Chorus]
Try to make it through today, don't worry about tomorrow
Tomorrow gon' be full of it's own problems anyway
Try to make it through today, don't worry about the past
Let that be motivation, to face obstacles in your way
Is this what I gotta go through, to get to heaven
Cause I feel like I'm about to lose it, I just can't take it anymore

[Z-Ro]
Damn I ain't know, all of my friends were suppose to turn into foes
And rob me for everything, down to my clothes
Everytime I try to get ahead, something keeps holding me back
My records be selling, but I can't even get a gold plaque
Not because I ain't jamming, but if my songs were for dancing
I could show you a mansion, on How I'm Living
Instead I pawn my jewelry for bread, and I got done by my woman
The way Mike Tyson got done in by Robin Givens
I ain't never seen a U-Haul, behind a hearse
So I know I can't take nothing with me, when I'm leaving this earth
I'm just saying, I'm tired of being bare footed
And before I can put food on the table, I gotta find somewhere to put it
Lord I been doing bad so long, but bless the ones that do me wrong
Place a hedge of protection, around their homes
It's hard for me to forgive em, but then
I remember you forgave all of my sins, so let me repent again

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
Life is something that we don't own, we only borrow
Understand, that today is simply yesterday's tomorrow
Yesterday is gone, tomorrow's a unpromised expectation
That means that today, is the only realization
We take life for granted daily, being negligent and mindless
Before the graphs and memories, make moments become timeless
Now enough emphasis placed, on spiritual assignments
Deep level of blindness, made me overlook God's kindness
Legacy is the point of life, we only here shortly
Some of the greatest men that ever lived, never saw forty
And God said that he plans, to make all things new
The question is, in the hereafter will they remember you
Why do the negative side of life, we constantly breed
Do what goes around come around, apply to good deeds
You know you need to move forward, and I see that you trying to
But you bumping into walls, cause you keep looking behind you

[Chorus]

Nigga we drop real shit, real talk
It ain't all about a chain and some diamonds nigga
It's about putting on your thinking cap
Yeah, light bulb</pre>
