[Chorus: Onyx]
Hammers on deck, hammers on deck
Hammers on deck we got them hammers on deck
Hammers on deck, hammers on deck
Hammers on deck we got them hammers on deck

[Verse One: Fredro Starr]
Yeah! Aiyyo hammers on deck forty grand on my neck
Ten on my neck buck fifty for the whip
Standin on the set fo' fifth on my hip
Sixteen in the clip plus one in the hat
I don't like guns but without one I'll be dead
Hammers on deck like I work construction
Shooters on deck, quick, go merk somethin
Got a new connect in the sheets four automatic
Niggas will give it to ya when you caught in traffic
I bought it plastic they don't even look real
When them hammers come out, they be shook for real
Walk in the dealership hammers on deck
In that GT bad bitch hand on her dress

[Chorus: Onyx]
Hammers on deck, hammers on deck
Hammers on deck we got them hammers on deck
Hammers on deck, hammers on deck
Hammers on deck we got them hammers on deck

[Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz]
Shit, we in the club, blammers on deck
I got the kind of ammo demand your respect
And if you speak to me, imagine there's a gun in your face
'Cause if you step outta place, nigga that's 'gon be the case
In a trunk, I got mask and surgical gloves
Besides, who's gonna care if I murder few thugs?!
If I'm chillin with my family (Hammers on deck)
If it's just my bitch and me (Hammers on deck)
Everywhere I go it's like I got a armed guard
'Cause I'm always armed then they call me the God
A nigga tryin to take my food won't be no discussions
Just some, consequences and repercussions
With them hammers on deck

[Chorus: Onyx]
Hammers on deck, Hammers on deck we got them hammers on deck
Hammers on deck, hammers on deck
Hammers on deck we got them hammers on deck
Hammers on deck, hammers on deck
Hammers on deck we got them hammers on deck
Hammers on deck, hammers on deck
Hammers on deck we got them hammers on deck
Hammers on deck, hammers on deck
Hammers on deck we got them hammers on deck</pre>
