Yeah..
Yeah..
What up..

What up, you're in my dreams
I can have anything and everything I ever wanted
Yeah..
I can think of anything and everything I ever needed
Right here in my dreams
Everything is a-okay
I don't worry about anything
Cause every day, every day, every day is sunny
Here in my dreams, nahh
Welcome.. yeah
Welcome.. you're in my dreams
This is a dream come true
Finding the perfect words to sing to you
Here in my dreams
Everything plays out, exactly how I want them to
Everything turns out dope
Right here in my dreams
Welcome.. yeah
Welcome.. you're in my dreams, nahh
 
[Common - Narrating]
Long before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone
Some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in
content with being blinded by rules and judgment
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life,
but toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions
and issues never before heard so vividly and honest
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself, but his dreams too
This is the story of the Man On The Moon</pre>
