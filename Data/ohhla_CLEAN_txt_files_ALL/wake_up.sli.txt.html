Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Wake up late
Wake up late
Wake up late
Wake up late
Said wake up late late afternoon
I said wake up late too late for school
I say my daddy always said go get a job
Mommy always said I am a slob
I said oh oh oh
Tell me now
Oh oh oh
Tell me now
Oh oh oh
Wake up late
Wake up late
Wake up late
Wake up late
I say
Come a come a come a come a come a care
I said ah can I tell ya baby what a time of year
We say ah headed for the bottle wanna drink some booze
Wake up in the morning gonna hit the snooze
Said oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Tell me now
Oh oh oh
Tell me now
Oh oh oh
Wake up late
Wake up late
Wake up late
Wake up late
Say come a come a come a come a come a care
I say can I tell ya baby what a time of year
We say I headed for the bottle wanna drink some booze
Wake up in the morning gonna hit the snooze
Said oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Tell me now
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Wake up late
Wake up late
Cmon

C'mon people all say now
