[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo! Yeah so you know, word, them niggas got the shoes up in there son
Nah nah nah hold hold it....who that over there? 
Yeah, damn!

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Baby I can bring the heat, when it's cold outside
The one you need, baby ride or die
Anything, that you can imagine
I can make it happen, only one to hold you down
A good man deserves a good woman
A good woman that'll treat you right
Only one to hold you down

[Verse One: Raekwon]
Aiyyo come here young lady with the skin of a baby (That's right)
Who dress like a Wall Street woman you Haley
I know your family they my people for life
Had a beef behind the wall one of your cousins he threw me a knife 
But that's yesteryear's life is intact, been battin quit rappin
But I'm just reactin your body packin
I know not to ask a woman's age but it's crazy these days
No time for slipups the industry is crazy
Bloodhounds chasin these girls, girls chasin these birds
They see whips we see curves
But I need one with knowledge itself and hold words say word
Yo hop inside the aston and put your feet on the fur
Let's talk put the bergon in the back by the door
Don't put it on the floor it's bad luck so don't fall
You got a strong aura I'm diggin the snow renegin
I want a boo who 'gon give me the business, hittin then it's sealed 

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Baby I can bring the heat, when it's cold outside
The one you need, baby ride or die
Anything, that you can imagine
I can make it happen, only one to hold you down
A good man deserves a good woman
A good woman that'll treat you right
Only one to hold you down

[Verse Two: Raekwon]
Take the keys to the lab put your gearin the master
Don't worry 'bout paper that's after
Life's chapter we good, keep it to yourself no need for gasups
Keep in tuned, lert me buy you a clinic, save your black cousins
No I'm not racial I'm pro black, it's all in the facial
I put so many on meetin pesos
Free trips send the niggas to Caicos
My buildin lego designed it with some real estate and paid fake hoes
No I'm not nice boo I'm humble and spicy
I'll be down to shoot the five for my wife be draws and Nike's 
Capricorns attractin mad pisces, throw on these iceys
Watch your bitches fall out, yep flight season
And I'm a take you everywhere you wanna go, where you wanna be?
Let's don out we hold hands and roll
Fly super bubble give me some sugar 
Let's jump in the jet book up then make it to the crib give me the hook up
 
[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Baby I can bring the heat, when it's cold outside
The one you need, baby ride or die
Anything, that you can imagine
I can make it happen, only one to hold you down
A good man deserves a good woman
A good woman that'll treat you right
Only one to hold you down</pre>
