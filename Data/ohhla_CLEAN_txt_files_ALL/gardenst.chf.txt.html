[Intro: Popa Chief]
Hold it, hold it..
I wouldn't do that if I was you
Cuz you ain't me
You might end up with a sprained tongue or something, yo
Don't try to be bigger than you really is, yo
Chill, chill

[Chorus: Popa Chief]
Just cuz the grass is greener in Garden State
Don't think my niggas don't brandish hammers in Garden State
Grade A, top choice hands in Garden State
To show your paper work is straight in Garden State

[Bridge: Popa Chief]
Peace to my dogs all swoll in Penn State
Yo, I want a Hungryman plate
North, East, West, South Jersey, come on

[Popa Chief]
I got a rollie tree, just set it
Bout to take mine with tomatos, cheese and lettuce
Ain't nothing to discuss, get it? You coming with us
Pedal to the metal, Timb boots and smelling like gas
Ball hogging, that's Jay with no cash
Unlimited fingers and words, like keys and birds
Merge of hash and herbs, swing and swerve
I got big balls, and some nerve
And I keep scraping my hubcaps on the curb
Just cuz the grass is greener, don't think my F.A. dog
Don't carry big shanks and heaters, uh-oh
They nice with they dick beaters
Word to mother, you hate, the secrets gather
Where I'm from, ain't nothing sweet, even the fly chicks is rugged
I founded Burnt Biskut Productz with no budget
Me and the mic is a match made in heaven, go to love it
My rhymes'll make you ODB, easy does it
The crap tables and the slots down in A.C.
To all the hottest spots in B.C.
We got the livest roosters and chickidees
We got the phattest knots, rounding the county
Trenton makes the world, takes
And we lick nuff shots to make the earth quake
All my niggas who party in cars, like clubs and bars
Got all my chicks looking like models and stars, come on

[Interlude: Popa Chief]
Yo, I can't stop blazing trees with my niggas
I love all these beautiful women

[Hook: Popa Chief]
Where my heart at? Where my roots at?
Where my home at, I represent (South Jerz)
Where your heart at? Where your roots at?
Where your home at, what you represent? (S.J.)

[Popa Chief]
I'm black, three times, better than before
Ain't a damn thing changed, the path is still war
The style is steel law, Pop Chief is still hardcore
Took the long route and a couple of detours
A couple of world tours, sorry I kept ya'll waiting
So long, South Jerz, but no I'm all yours
Let the calm burn, it's everybody's turn
And the bubble rain and pour, party on big worm
L.Q., greasy sherms, toes, nails, in tights
Ass, tits, weaves, from braids and perms
Live at the barbecue, with all my S.J. people
This one's so hot, you better come to the sequel

[Interlude: Popa Chief]
Aight, bartender, freshen up all my people's drinks
Everybody stop panicking, the trees are circulating
Wanda, you thirteen? Get up out the door, you need to up out of here
Peace...

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Popa Chief]
Peace to my dogs all swoll in Penn State</pre>
