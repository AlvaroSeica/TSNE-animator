[Intro: Yukon Black]
Pay attention, This is serious right here
For the first time I'ma say somehtin
And hopefully be the last, Come on

[Yukon Black]
The eighties was crazy I heard a lot of people say
Me and my generation prolly wasn't gonna make it
And now I'm sayin the same shit, Seein shorties on the street
Half the time half baked and half naked, How they get here
Nigga it's our fault, We stayed in they eyes and ears walkin that dumb talk
Now they own guns and bun talk, Yeah I'm blamin hip hop
And who woulda thought I'd be standin in front of mic
Talkin bad and lookin down upon the love of my life, The love of my life
Talkin bad and lookin down upon the love of my life
Talkin bad and lookin down upon the love of my life

[Long Axe]
Is this mic on
Shit I feel like a dead beat dad with my past
Stepped out for cigarettes but I aint look back
Game callin me back, But I can't look back
Been at it for a minute, They say time changes
I love it, I hate it, Damn my mind changes when I first had it
I thought it would never change us
Then we got stubborn with the bubblin ideas
A person with our years will verse it with our kids
Tall enough to speak it in our years
Daddy your the greatest, I struggle with dry tears
Shits dissolvin, Not evolve, Slip the mickey in my ear
The one thing I love just died here
Yeah, Head phones to headstones, Up to 97 was my year
And their gone, But I'm keepin watch from right here
Yukon Black, Hidden Aspects, Member the first time

[Yukon Black]
What we need to prepare
They gettin us with aids and got us up in they jail
Man we know better, I'm no Begga
Is this my makin up or breakin up letter
All I know is hip hop got a spot in my heart forever, Forever
