We gon' take 'em all the way back down with this one

(Akon in background)
(Verse 1)
[Miwa Yoshida] We lay like lovers
               In a warm embrace
[Akon]         Lovers in a warm embrace
[Miwa Yoshida] Your kisses thrill me
               Like no one before
[Akon]         Eh
[Miwa Yoshida] Baby, I'm all yours (Uh huh)
               Living just for you (Uh huh)
[Akon]         Uh huh
               Yeah

(Verse 2)
[Miwa Yoshida] I can see the moonlight
               Shining through the mist
[Akon]         Shining through the mist
[Miwa Yoshida] The moonbeams playing
               Over you and me
[Akon]         Eh
[Miwa Yoshida] I see the light of love (Uh huh)
               Shining in your eyes (Uh huh)
[Akon]         Uh huh
               Yeah (Break it down)

Hook: Miwa Yoshida
I'm
Holding you in my arms
Loving you beneath the stars
I don't want the night to steal you
Away

[Akon]
Steal you away

Chorus: Dreams Come True
Hold me close
I want you so
Don't you know that, baby?
Your love has touched
My very soul
Can you feel it, baby?
Oh
Never let me go
Darling cause we're
So in love
And we can dream on
Sweet dream

[Akon]
We gon' bring it back down a little bit
Let's go

(Verse 3)
[Miwa Yoshida] Your shadow captured
               In the silent night
[Akon]         In the silent night
[Miwa Yoshida] I feel your breath, it whispers
               Like a breeze
[Akon]         Eh
[Miwa Yoshida] Oh baby, please be mine (Uh huh)
               Til the end of time (Uh huh)
[Akon]         Uh huh
               Yeah

Repeat Hook

[Akon]
Steal you away
Steal you away

Repeat Chorus
