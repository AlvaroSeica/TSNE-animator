[Domo Genesis]
I'ma fall through right after this interview
You should call your bitches up cause I'ma bring my niggaz through
We can kick it, baby, if it's good with you
I'm tryin to get high, I can bring in like a zip or two
That's how it gets when we just kickin it
That's how it gets when we just kickin it
That's how it gets when we just kickin it
Ain't tryin to fuck nothin up, nah, we just kickin it
My nigga Jason got cases of light liquor from last night
if you and your girls act right (heyyy~!)
We can all get a little tipsy
I mean we ain't gotta do nothin risky, we just kickin it
That's how it gets when we just kickin it
No need for trippin, we just kickin it
That's how it gets when we be kickin it
We just kickin it
You're finger signalin, I'm listenin
Leap through the kitchen to a room I fall victim in
Before the gameplay, we do a little scrimmagin
No love involved, she know niggaz just kickin it
Yeah, she know that we just kickin it
That's how it gets when we just kickin it
She ain't trippin, we just kickin it
That's how it, when uh, when we kickin it
She not a groupie, not a hoe, she just a fan
whose boundaries are crossed simply because I'm the man
And for a single night, she pretends that I'm her man
It end in disappointment when I'm outtie when it ends
Cause that's how it gets when we just kickin it
That's not my bitch, no we just kickin it
No need to trip cause we just kickin it
That's how it gets when we just kickin it
(You can't handle none of this shit anyway!) We just kickin it
That's how it gets when we just kickin it
Salute me gang apprenticeship
Where you can't get no membership
Yeah, Genesis
Rolling Papers, nigga, hahaha
(He look like he ain't got no stroke)
(That nigga.. is whack)
(Yeah, I can't fuck with that)
(Fuck you! Fuck him!)</pre>
