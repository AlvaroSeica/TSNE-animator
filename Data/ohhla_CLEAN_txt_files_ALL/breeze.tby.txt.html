Typed by: Toby

[Toby]
let the music play to illuminate the truth 
in all the dusty corners of our memories our youth betrayed 
I was dancing all through the day 
with Michael Jackson on my stereo, my living room the stage 
was going through that Moonwalk phase 
for attention to impress them with the moves I made 
I got older and the mood was changed 
communicating all the thoughts that went through my brain 
got confusing, but that's Human Nature 
soon I made the conclusion that music is a language 
I learned to use it to relate 
each of those thoughts and the feelings that grew with age 
when it pushed past the limits of control 
and the raindrops dripped down the windows to my soul 
sitting in the middle of it, little did I know 
that listening to that rhythm was replenishing my hope 

[Chorus]
everybody is another note in my song 
and my life is the chorus so sing along 
the world is breathing music 
feel the breeze go through my soul 
lay my voice upon the breeze and fly 

[Toby]
they say do it for the love, 
but I'm human, as soon as the breeze blew in knew it was a drug 
storm brewing, moving through my blood 
what a rush, felt the music tune in to the touch 
pulse sets the rhythm, and then I think of a 
melody that can't wait dancing in sync with it 
in my head I translate to english 
and send it down my landscape to handshake my fingertips 
to write my newest lyrics 
souvenirs of music my ears would hear through the years 
hip hop, jazz, and acoustic players 
a few careers, latin, blues, and jewish prayers 
rock and roll, lots of soul 
help me cross the obstacles I got to know 
bring it all together, watch it grow 
the beauty's lost control, man, I gots to go 
feel the breeze 

[Chorus]
everybody is another note in my song 
and my life is the chorus so sing along 
the world is breathing music 
feel the breeze go through my soul 
lay my voice upon the breeze and fly 

sing my song 
melodies run through my mind from night to dawn 
the quiet storm inside me lets go 
moving to the rhythm of my soul</pre>
