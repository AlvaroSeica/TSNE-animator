Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
We'll gonna run these slums
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
We'll gonna run these slums
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly

Slum won't call the crew
Cause slow it up on the slum
You say I'm slumming the building?
So I'm gonna creep right into
Will you gonna feel me?

What's up mambo rambo?
Ride me like a camel
She get dirty in them camos
I'm a take a gamble
Lay her flat just like some sandals
Flip her like a channel
Then pass her off straight to Lambo
All my niggaz slum, all my niggaz slum
A rapper like a rampapapam
I know you're tryin' to fuss
Oh, girl, don't you play dumm
Slums gonna come to me

Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
We'll gonna run these slums
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
We'll gonna run these slums
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly

Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
We'll gonna run these slums
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
We'll gonna run these slums
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly

All them got the slum
They ain't hidin', they're ready
That bitch likes peanut butter
She just named my jelly
Tell me when you're ready
I don't touch it if you smell it
Slum lords, slum lords, slum lords
Slum lords, slum lords, slum lords
Said there are some slums in the house
Slum lords, slum lords, slum lords
Slum lords, slum lords, slum lords

Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
We'll gonna run these slums
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
We'll gonna run these slums
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly
Your hoe will get sly

Rule no 1, no mercy, rule no 2. No tolerance
Rule no.3 don't you claim me

That's funny, little bitch</pre>
