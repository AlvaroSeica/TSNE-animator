Aye man, I'm a tell you something about your hoe
I'm a tell you something about your bitch man
I don't believe shit she say man
Aye I don't believe shit she say

Bitch don't be lyin
Bitch why you lyin?
I don't believe you
Bitch why you lyin?

Bitch don't lie to the mackaville
I never claimed you're P but I'm mack as hell
Let me say you bout the rain cause you be outside
Bitch still be in my eye, is you ready to ride?
I'm fucking those hoes cause they always rise
Don't lie to me cause you're lying to Guss
I'm so real that they beg to pay
I never took a whole minute cause my feet too high
Simple dudes like simple girls
I'm raised, got nobody in my world
I ain't gonna lie about everything I own
That's all, it's a rap, you feel me?
Bitch wanna fuck? You gonna pay me cash
Have no diseases and I look the cleanest
Bitch don't lie, you know who the meanest
Life games hoe and I look like we just
Lil boss...

Bitch I see you lying every goddamn day okay?
No, don't lie to me
I don't believe those goddamn lies
Hoe don't lie to me
Okay, leave me alone, leave me alone
Hoe don't lie to me
Bitch get out my face, I don't believe you
No, don't lie to me
Bitch, why are you lying

I'm a tell you, this about a bitch I knows
She a rich bitch, but her mind like a hoe
I'm the guy that feel cause I'm saving hoes
I'm like a golf course, I be playing with hoes
Figures don't know I have the Bentley coupe
And drop the roof, I got to my roots
Whips will change, change will whips
Man fuck your chain and fuck your bitch
Riding on the Benz and I scare poor girls
And in front of the bus, looking at my waves
Dido me to the back just to compensate
My last name mack bitch, kiss my ass
You about the roads, fuck the grass
Bitch I'm the police and I fuck with taz
Hoes on my dick cause I'm making cash
Yea, and I might just flash

Hoe don't lie to me
Don't do that
Girl don't lie to me
It's to the day hoe
Hoe don't lie to me
Okay...
