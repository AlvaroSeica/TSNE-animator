Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
First I wake up, wake up, thinking of a plan to get my cake up, cake up
Cause I can't pay the rent with school papers
I need two acres and more
I know how it feel walking out the door pockets out of dough
Out it doe, be on the flow
We smoking endo, but we out doe, adios
My audio getting me that Audi or the range rov
Mahogany colored clothing, my hog in the road
Drive slow, cruising down memory lane before I hit the streets
Have my melody playing, creators just lie with my [?]
Had her between guys, I think I'm married to Jane
I remember the days when I'd forever complain
That's way before they started paying, I was in pain
Sick in the brain like I never met a physicist yet
Only lyricist on my metaphysics intellect

[Chorus]
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of time
Sweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga
Sweet dreams, stuck in the 90s
90s babies it's a matter of time
And time's not rewinding, yeah

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Been on my grind, I keep it 50-50
That's 100 on the real, no balance scales, still trippy
Where I live it's either you know talents well and sell records
Or know talent, well we still sell for the record
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the trap game
In fact is the exact same, and these tracks is my crack caine
And if you listening then you a fan
Our music is the kill like some vaccines
I'm exotic to the core so stop asking
Got the blueprints to the game, but I read it as king
There's 47 ways to get this green
One is being an enslaved being, the other dreams
Red pill or blue bean, I can't sit still I'm too lean, nigga
Brush my bill on [?]
Niggas on my tail now that I blew green

[Chorus]</pre>
