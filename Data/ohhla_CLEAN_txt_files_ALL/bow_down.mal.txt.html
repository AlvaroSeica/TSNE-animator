[Chorus: No Malice]
Bowin down to riches, bow down no mo'
Trickin on these misses, bow down no mo'
All these dudes is snitches, bow down no mo'
I'm on top my business, bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'
Bow down no mo', bow down no mo'

[No Malice]
God bless the child, that got his own
I don't look to momma, her baby grown
We would ship 'em in, then we get 'em gone
You could smell it on me, like a cheap cologne
He pardoned my wrongs, that's what The Father said
It's like I had no soul, I was the walking dead
Had to get ahead, ain't got time to sympathize
I was sellin that rock, and if he dies, he dies
So cold-blooded but flooded was the bezel
I was praising God but living like the devil
How could I meddle, all them years I peddled crack
I did it the best, I dare not call the kettle black
Big and bad, out here actin like nothin phase me
At Tony's arrangement, I was cryin like a baby
Look at his baby, snot with the ugly face
Listenin to some jurors singin, "Bailiff, come take him away"

[Chorus]

[No Malice]
Those were the days, I remember them well
At the Marriott, layin up with Jezebel
Don't kiss and tell, this could be our little secret
Tellin me she loved me, and I believed it
Lookin back, oh what a fool I was
Different chick every night, like it was humorous
It fueled my lust but now I hang my head in shame
They got the nerve to ask, did they really hustle caine?
Yes indeed, them chickens really flew the coop
Crack the gong with them birds, cock-a-doodle-doo
Them other dudes on the mic ain't tellin you the truth
That's why I been sick of rap, chicken noodle soup
New recruits better salute, poppa don't play
They got me takin off my belt in here, "Sa-da-tay~!"
What'd I say? Fix ya face and pull up ya bridges
Say good riddance, one-half of Clipse, no more Malicious

[Chorus]</pre>
