[Chorus - 2X]
When we ride, we creep
Bang this shit in yo' Jeep
Nigga when we slide, you'll see
Can't do pimpin' like me

[Daz Dillinger]
When we ride, you'll know
When you see a gangsta puffin' that 'dro
That's when ya die, real slow
When the shells drop from the fo'-fo'

We caught him slippin' at his mama house
That's how it is motherfucker when the drama's out
Retaliate and conversate with nothin' but guns
To let you and your niggaz know that I ain't the one
Gorilla black, I'll stack 'em and click 'em
Click 'em and clack 'em
Body tap 'em and wrap 'em, you niggaz ain't active
Long Beach the city of Crip gangsta criminals
When we cross path nigga this is what I do to you
.22 (freeze!) hit you low, blow half your back out
Stand over you bitch ass niggaz with my gat out
Dumpin' them shells, y'all know where we dwell
Eastside motherfucker (send 'em all to hell)

[Chorus - 2X]
When we ride, we creep
Bang this shit in yo' Jeep
Nigga when we slide, you'll see
Can't do pimpin' like me

[Kurupt]
See I ride, I creep
I'll put ya bitch ass to sleep
Hit up the squad, nigga D.P.
D.P.G.C. G's

What the fuck you wanna do nigga, get 'em up
We gon' have to beat this nigga up
and show him not to fuck with these D.P.G. amazons and natives
And set an example - trample, stomp and K 'em
This is what it is, nothin' but D.P.G. fo' shiz
I'm listenin' to this nigga talkin' all that there
The nigga so loud I can't help but hear
So I just walked on over and said
"Shut the fuck up" and told this bitch to come here
Cause this is how we do it in the D.P.G.
Crack a bitch and keep it rollin'
and keep it one hundred up in the streets
See we ride

[Chorus - 2X]
When we ride, we creep
Bang this shit in yo' Jeep
Nigga when we slide, you'll see
Can't do pimpin' like me</pre>
