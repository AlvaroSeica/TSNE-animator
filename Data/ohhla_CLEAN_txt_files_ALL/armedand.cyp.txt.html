[B Real]
Ready, set, go I'm ready to run
Steady we get dough under the sun
About to let go, show me respect though
We'll affect your, soul and your mental
We came from the bottom and rose to the top
Like the cream in ya coffee, burnin' hot
Climbin' the Billboard for the number one spot
King of the block, stop for a second and watch
Look and learn don't loose your knot
No more bottles to pop, no birds in the drop
But we still rollin', pockets swollen
We're, locked and loaded and the scene exploded
We're solid as ever on any endeavor
Cypress Hill forever it doesn't get any better
We, came and saw, and conquered it all
But we're hungry for more like the kids in Darfur

(Chorus)
We live hard still armed and dangerous
We on guard, be alarmed don't play wit' us
Play this song gotta bounce, you're safe with us
Come along hit the bong and blaze with us

[Sen Dog]
I'm the Dog and I'm undisputed, and you're being recruited
I'm the general that your boys saluted
Give you a minute to see how we do it
You've never seen such finesse 'cause you're so polluted
I'm the king in this game ya stone gate
Knocked 'em out the park when I'm standin' at home plate
So many years of blood, sweat and tears
Without me and the dogs there ain't switchin' the gears
But I'm still the same man from back in the day
And I'm still gettin' love from the Apple to L.A.
Jake One, hit play, verse started to sway
Every time I leave the city, fools want me to stay
'Cause they stay loyal so it's harder to go
But like the weed under the lights, I got to grow
But that means I roll, but I'll return later
Give props to my people, buckshot the haters

(Chorus - repeat 2X)

[B Real]
Raise your hands in the air like you supposed ta
And everybody scream like you're on a roller coaster
We down, with La Coka Nostra
We smashin', with Sick Jacken and the Soul Assassins
The hip hop culture, will fuck you vultures
You caught in the rapture, all I hear is laughter
In a year's time, some of you punks won't matter
Let's see if, you can hang as you climb the ladder
You ain't a rapper, you're a fuckin' joke
A one shot hack on a track, get your pass revoked
I got keys to the city and we locking you out
You come hard in the paint, and I'm blocking you out
So run to the hills and hide where you can
Or just put the mic down, and be that fan
With your, pen in hand outside of the lobby
I'm a pro get my signature, this ain't no hobby

(Chorus - repeat 2X)</pre>
