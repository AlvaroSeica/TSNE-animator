I don't wanna Fight. I just wanna Live
I wake up every morning like Something Gotta Give
Death on the Left. Crime on the Right
Will it ever Change? Probably not overnight
This World will test YOUR Heart. It'll test YOUR Soul
It'll make YOU wanna break down and Lose Control
YOU might wanna Fold. YOU might Live in Doubt
It's ALL in how YOUR cards dealt and how YOU deal 'em out
Some say it's half empty. I say it's half full
I know at times Life can be more than a handful
Reach for the Sky. WE get everything WE plan for
Peace and War all depends on what YOU Stand For
What YOU Stand For?
What YOU Stand For?
What YOU Stand For?
Peace and War all depends on what YOU Stand For</pre>
