[Intro - Lloyd - talking] (Chamillionaire)
It's time to make a movie, it's time to make a movie, yeaaaaah
(Oh yeah, Chamillitary mayne)
And young Lloyd oh, (Twista, let's get it)

[Chorus 1 - Lloyd] (Chamillionaire) - w/ ad libs
Girl ya hypnotize me, love the way ya movin
Sit back like a player, while ya doin what ya doin
Whisper in my ear, tellin me how she gon' do me
Oh I think she likes me, so it's time to make a movie
(Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie
Time to make a, oh yeah, time to make a movie
Time to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie
Oh I think she likes me, so it's time to make a movie)

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Let's get it, you know what it is homegirl, let's get it
Ya little boyfriend'll never know that we did it
Got a homegirl, let me know if she with it
Two girls, one bed, let me know and we'll split it, quit it
Tell me how he fin' to know (oh!)
Way too much bread, no Keebler though (oh!)
When I see money, I speed to the dough
If it ain't no dough, I speed to the do'
Where she fin' to go?
Stick to the script, get used to my plot
Makin it wet, no use of a prop
I'm a make you regret not usin a mop (woo!)
Boostin your stock (woo!), you lookin hot
So I bet that we gon' Tom Cruise to the top (oh!)
I could turn the Ros√© down to the south
And I love how your mouth never losin a (drop)
Aye, you could have it girl
Not an amateur, I could manage ya
Candy car lookin bluer than an Avatar
I'll help you get your "Groove Back" like Angela
I could handle her, show her I'm the best
An Academy Award, yeah the Oscars next
If Trey Songz tellin you that he +Invented Sex+
I guess you can say that I invented checks (yes)

[Chorus 1] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 2 - Twista]
What's up little mama? Come let me be your manager
Be your photographer, you be the one I'm a take a picture of (click)
You could be in my cinema, then I'm a give you whatever you want
I'm a do anything to get your love (oh)
Hit it from the back and hit it from the front
And I'm a look in the camera, so I could let 'em know it's me up in it (Twista)
When I'm filmin, I'll be rated X triple
'Cause I circled your nipples and every movie you gon' be up in it (uh huh)
When we out in public, you can be classy
But when we get some privacy baby, you can be my porn star (oh!)
Keep the lights on, 'cause I wanna see it, it's better for shootin
How you be lookin, I see you goin far (yep)
I say blow me a kiss, you blow it right back (uh huh)
Openin up your legs, now you on the right track (uh huh)
Let me aim the camera down while you bite that (uh huh)
Lookin freaky up at the lense, do you like that? (that, that)
Way I be workin your body like I be workin the pictures in the portfolio (oh!)
I don't know if it was the face, it was the hair, it was the ass
That make me want to put you up in the video (oh!)
It's the Twista with the Chamillionaire (yes)
Murder in the booth, when I smoke a philly in there (yes)
I'll be the director, come and give me a chair
Star quality, I see a ?

[Chorus 2 - Lloyd] - w/ ad libs
Girl ya hypnotize me, love the way ya movin
Sit back like a player, while ya doin what ya doin
Whisper in my ear, tellin me how she gon' do me
Oh I think she likes me, so it's time to make a movie

[Break - Chamillionaire]
Ain't no need to be nervous, we can get some room service
I can give it how you want it girl, if that's okay
Time to make a movie, movie, time to make a movie
Gotta tell me how you want it, you know I'm a be up on it
From the night until the morning, girl if that's okay
Time to make a movie, movie, time to make a movie
One, two, three, go (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Oh, she likes me, oh, let's get it
One, two, three, go (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Oh, she likes me, oh, let's make a movie

[Chorus 1] - w/ ad libs</pre>
