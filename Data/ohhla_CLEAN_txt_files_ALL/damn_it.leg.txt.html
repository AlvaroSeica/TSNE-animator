[Intro: Murs]
Living legends

[Murs]
(Yeah) Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Not up on the jock just up in the spot
Hard up on my rock now I'm bumpin' Iggy Pop
Travelin' the globe tryin' to make your city hot
If my song works your soul then that really means a lot
Help you thru a shitty spot
Ya'll all that I got and I know it's clich√©
But your love and respect help me thru each day
Hope these words mean more to you with each play
I'm tryin' to reach great
And then reach out into the next plane
Hoping that my struggles and my efforts weren't in vain
Tryin' to bring about a change and fuck that I did
One of few rappers really speaking to these kids
With the truth that is this is proof I is
Just another human being jam packed full of thoughts
I can only be as perfect as this culture I exalt

[The Grouch]
Operation maintain muscle built
Save me from the pain aim hustle we'll
By-pass the ladder and gather among gods
I fast for clarity share with me odds get
Overcome we show it the sun exudes
Go with the one fused or power the drum and choose
Life love light liberty logically
Live with me methodically raise up your prodigy
It ought to be that way that way's a smart one
Don't gotta be that way your way is art done
Different how we think might you agree
Height you will see in my spit I invite you to be

[Chorus]
[Murs] Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Life can't weigh me down I'm above my opponents
[Bicasso] Makin' this rappin' feel like a last jam right
[Aesop] But keeping it focused so folks can all shine bright
[The Grouch] Damn it feels good to see people up on it
[Murs] Life can't weigh me down I'm above my opponents
[Aesop] We makin' this rappin' sound like the last jam right
[Bicasso] But keeping it focused so folks can all shine bright

[Bicasso]
Vision quest who paid the price
Who came in light the way the burn
They gave their life it was their turn
We had to learn to mourn their death
It's like rebirth ignite the rest
To fight to live we might just give
The righteous kid a mike instead
The hype is dead but like they said
It's a penny for your thought now
Make a million in a minute off of getting caught
Styles ain't shit when they thought
That this was all about criiiime
P-I-M-P mind is empty B-I tempt me
Mind is full but maybe partial
'cause there's always room to grow

[Aesop]
Life thru the existence of man
This eternal plan to put power in the hands
Of those unwilling to watch the land of the slaves
Obey their master's will though those whom choose will
Instill intelligent thoughts in a pill to be swallowed at will
Will man survive this knowledge of skill
Still ignorance fills the minds of the blind
Stuck behind waiting in line to find some substance
Some tense individuals build a fence around the ritual
Of life never exciting the might which will
Eventually kill all means of relative thinking of the light
Stuck in the dark without no sight
Night breeds evil though not all people are
Monsters in the fight against what's really right
The role makes song to prolong the motion of the movement
But it's still good to see the Sayers saying it's in the music

[Chorus]

[Scarub]
Flirt with the future like moths do flames
Some say my approach is wild
They're right I never been tamed
A clear focus with a harsh intent
I aim like one eye closed good eye open
I squint and blink yo
Shoot the shit to make the whole world blink
With they're mouths open choked up over my ink you flinch
We nudge you on like the jab of a elbow
You follow thru like the swing of a fist
Connections made like a kick in the ass
I keep it crackin' like the pops in a hit
I'm on it next like the record skips
You're off the richter like the legend rips
As real as you are is as real as it gets
I don't know what you took us for
But we gonna take it and split and be cool with it
Damn it feels good</pre>
