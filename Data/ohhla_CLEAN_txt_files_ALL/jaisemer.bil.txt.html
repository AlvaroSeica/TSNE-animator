LYRICS:
INTRO:
JAISE MERA PYAAR,
MERA PYAAR X4

VERSE 1:
Time was against me,
Running around looking around for you.
Guess I was just too dumb to see,
That you didn't even give a damn about me,
Me and you were always getting rowdy,
But I couldn't bear to let you go,
I had loved your for so long...

CHORUS:
JAISE MERA PYAAR,
MERA PYAAR X4

VERSE 2:
Your asking how I found out,
Your not as sneaky a you thought now are you,
This is heartbreak part two,
But part one was hard too,
Our relationship, was like a sinking ship,
But u keep thinking about,
How you kissed my lips yeah...

CHORUS:
JAISE MERA PYAAR,
MERA PYAAR X4

MIDDLE 8:
So alone I'm feeling,
Without you in my arms,
I find it hard to breathe in,
Coz' girl you broke my heart...

CHORUS:
JAISE MERA PYAAR,
MERA PYAAR X4

(THAT'S THE WAY I LOVED YOU...)
