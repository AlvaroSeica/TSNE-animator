Run quick you slip don't get a fix
In the rat race ambition
what they're wishing to get
Minimalists ride the sideline
scribble and bitch
Pray to a riddle till we fizzle out
brittle as brick
Stick and move
just to prove that the middle exists
While they choose to argue
bout who has the littlest dick
Stuck to the news with a noose
and some riddlin sick
Of the excuse
but too confused to be committed to shit
Flip to magazines and scenes that seem serene
Breed routines till everyone feeds on the machine
Tie your self esteem to the obscene extreme
Drink to achieved dreams
never knowing what themes mean

So you scream to your idols, image obsessed
Dressed to the x without a complex confessed
A direct contradiction but the truth they neglect
Because the ones that claim freedom
have the chains supressed
Yet from wise men to widowers
individuals filling us
With subliminal messages that's killing us
Really just making followers out of the villagers
Grilling us with ice till it flows from all cylinders
Finished and hollow tomorrow inside a bottle
Drink every drop
hop behind the wheel hit the throttle
The motto make sure every last pill is swallowed
wallow in thick sorrow till you hit the lotto

Don't front
You know we got what you want
what you need
Priced to bleed
Every dollar from your gripes and needs
You can't cover up your faults
with your nicest weave

The modern man
twenty minutes fix-ing
the pants he'll never fit-in
Brush-ing his hair behind the ears
that never list-en
think-ing a better brand of shirt
could be what's mis-sing
Remini-scing on the gear
that he was dipped-in
back in high school
when the girls that he was kiss-ing
we're ones that he was wish-ing
and they did all the pick-ing
Biological clocks are tick-ing
Mix-ing those inner fears with years of inner bitching
You're steady diss-ing inside your glass house
Passed out in denial of your masked doubt
Wondering why you lash out when the facts out
Slowly becoming everything you get so mad about
Figure it out, don't be so jealous of their luck
Can't pay your rent
cause of a hundred fifty dollar haircut
Wearing jeans with torn seams?
let's compare ruts
Face it you're the same square that you're scared of
And inside you know that you can't hide it
An appearance decided by tips misguided
Turning to your parents pockets to provide it
Hiding till the inherent splits collided
The lie is that you never ever try to hard
No matter the money spent
you cannot buy their scars
And the truth is something
you cannot escape from
Even if it's covered in the gloss
of the people that you take from

Don't front
You know we got what you want
what you need
Priced to bleed
Every dollar from your gripes and needs
You can't cover up your faults
with your nicest weave</pre>
