[Intro]
Yeah, there's twelve jewels to the Rubik's Cube
You gotta match the jewels together to unlock the secret code
This the Razah's Rubik's Cube

[Verse 1]
This is '08, still No Love Without Hate
So I sent 'em to the Pearly Gates with early wakes
We dug in the crates of the mid-eighties
For the heroin crack babies with .380's
And been insane since Cain made his first murder
Could take your brain cells much further
Do the knowledge, be a observer
Open your mind like the Blue Sky
Or go Judas, do suicide
You can't escape from the truth and die
You won't survive livin' through a lie
So the world became flesh for U-N-I-verse anything evil
Bang bang from the Desert Eagle
It's either Kush or a Sour Diesel, build a casino like Bugsy Siegel
So, show your poker face, 'cause if I spit, it's a open case
A closed casket for niggas fate...

[Hook]
When I give you this jewel, would you go and sell it back to the fool?
I was told by wise men that the Blacks was Jews
So that made me strap up wit tools
This is Razah's Rubik's Cube
If I give you this jewel, would you go and sell it back to the fool?
I was told by wise men that the Blacks was Jews
So that made me strap up wit tools
This is Razah's Rubik's Cube

[Verse 2]
They say my roots run deeper then the tree Eve ate off
Fasten your seat belt, prepare for the take off
Watch for the Romans, 'cause Julius got paid off
They move in a fort from Alexander to Adolf
My mind be a war machine built for the Moorish King
Same way Dru Ali stood for his own regime
Razah gon' ride for the casualties on my team
Load up our clips, wipe the gun off with baby oil
Devils want beef? We in the hallway waitin' for you
Half-man, half-immortal, send you through a time portal
Maccabee oracle, talk like Morpheus
This is motivation for the kids in the orphanage
Operation Butterfly, my mind metamorphosis
Change from a caterpillar, attack of the black guerrillas
Round up all the killers that stuck through the corners with us
Bumrush the White House, set off the transmitters
Breakin' all camcorders, hijack the radio
Hotwire the news van and turn to the Razah Show
("The largest manhunt in recent memory is being undertaken...")
Hotwire the news van and turn to the Razah Show

[Hook]
If I give you this jewel, would you go and sell it back to the fool?
I was told by wise men that the Blacks was Jews
So that made me strap up wit tools
This is Razah's Rubik's Cube
When I give you this jewel, would you go and sell it back to the fool?
I was told by wise men that the Blacks was Jews
So that made me strap up wit tools
This is Razah's Rubik's Cube

[Outro]
("Malcolm X again with a pen")
("My mind is a weapon")
("Malcolm X again with a pen")
("Malcolm X again with a pen")
("My mind is a weapon")
There's twelve jewels
Blue Sky Black Death, Choco on the boards
You now on the Razah's Ladder, baby, you on your way up

[Excerpt from The Boondock Saints]
"Somebody can just go out and get a gun and shoot somebody
because they feel that they're doing some good in the world?"
"Making the world a safer place."
"Are you kidding?"
"They're doing it for good, and they're only killing the people who kill."
"They're not out there just killing for fame."
"They should be in every major city."
"Every major city!"
"These guys are playing God, I mean, this whole religious deal,
who the hell do they think they are?"
"KILL 'EM ALL!"
"Oh, I'm all for it. Fuck them motherfuckers...
the more people they kill, the better it is for everybody."</pre>
