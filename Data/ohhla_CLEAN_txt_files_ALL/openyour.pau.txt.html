Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Open your mouth, I'm gonna put something nice into it!

"Oooh it feels good"
"Oooh it feels good"
"Oooh it feels good"
"Oooh it feels good"

{*moaning from 0:14 to 0:20*}

Open your mouth, I'm gonna put something nice into it!

"Oooh it feels good"
"Oooh it feels good"
"Oooh it feels good"
"Oooh it feels good"

Open your mouth, I'm gonna put something nice into it!

"Oh, I just don't know"
