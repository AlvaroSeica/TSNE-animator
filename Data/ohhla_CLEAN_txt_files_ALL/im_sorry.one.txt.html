[Mr. Lil One Talking]
Yeah, between me and you
sorry, sorry, we all got a lot to deal with
but you're the only one we gotta keep it real with

[Verse 1]
Dear god, forgive me for my sins, i've been trippin
I made promises to you about my drinkin
About my kids, and the way that I've been thinkin
Sometimes I feel like my world is slowly sinkin
I need a bottle to relax me and calm me
All that bottle ever did was really harm me
But should I call me, I'm speakin hypocritical
I got alcohol in me and gettin lyrical
I feel you in my presence on a daily
And I'm greatful that you gave me healthy babies
But not to shy away, I'm hurtin for a reason
I apologize, I'm sorry for the teasin
And I pray you don't forget me and protect me
I don't blame me if you don't like or respect me
But you know me like nobody else
Please forgive me, don't leave me by myself

[Chorus 2x]
Sorry for the mishaps, I never meant to fail you
There's another million things I wanna tell you
Keep me strong through my rights and my wrongs
Thank you for my kids, my life and my songs

[Verse 2]
I remember a couple months back, how I pleaded to you
I remember every word and I'll repeat it to you
Get me outta this, I'm in a jail cell
And if I let you down, send my soul to hell
Well I did, and I deserve for you to leave me
I'm speakin on the truth, and I hope that you believe me
Pleaded for my freedom, I put that on this earth
Don't wanna miss my little baby girl's birth
And you let me walk away and kept me happy
And kept the faith that nothing would distract me
Keep my word, do whatever not to break it
Keep it real right? I'd never thought I'd fake it
Not with you, but I did, I feel broken
Will you accept me with your arms wide open?
I hope you feel my pain and my repent
I hope you get this little message that I sent

[Chorus 2x]
Sorry for the mishaps, I never meant to fail you
There's another million things I wanna tell you
Keep me strong through my rights and my wrongs
Thank you for my kids, my life and my songs

[Mr. Lil One Talking]
Yeah man, you make a pact with god, then you make a pact with god
Make a promise, don't break it man
He's the man, he's the king, he's our father
And that needs to be respected, I'm ashamed
And I'm sorry, sorry, sorry</pre>
