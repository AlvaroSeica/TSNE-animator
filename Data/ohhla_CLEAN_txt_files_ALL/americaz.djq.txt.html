[DJ Quik]
And just when you motherfuckers thought it was over
I'm back up in this motherfucker..

	"You better get ready"
	"for-for-for for America's most complete artist"
		"What's your name boy?"
"I.. am.."	"America's most complete artist"
	"You better get ready"
	"for America's most complete artist"
[Quik]	Doin much damage in the ninety-two
	"for America's mo-mo-mo-mo
	 most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"

[DJ Quik]
Now DJ Quik is the nigga that's comin up real thick
I'm a stone funkaholic yet I don't need Schick
because there ain't another nigga more versatile
DJ Quik been bustin funky rhythms all the while
And this song is for the homies who was down with me
When I was broke as a joke, flat with no mon-ey
And to them doubtin-ass motherfuckers, cause they don't know yeah
Instead of showin and provin yo I'm provin that I'm the show
Now who wants to fade this modern day prophet?
Take two steps forward, one shell and you droppin
because I don't go toe to toe, I go hoe to hoe
Yo' hoe is so-so, so yo, I think I better let her go
cause she ain't worth my time
And before I get off into another rhyme
I'ma bring this verse to a climax, grab the axe
Open the door, clear the floor, and make way

	"for America's most complete artist"
		"What's your name boy?"
"I.. am.."	"America's most complete artist"
[Quik]	Sucker ass niggaz can't fade me
	"for America's most complete artist"
"Quik.."	"What kind of name is that for a nigga?"
	"for America's mo-mo-mo-mo
	 most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"

[DJ Quik]
Now when I say I'm complete;
that means I'm true to my game and my cap
And I refrain from bein played like a sap
And a bitch?  No bitch can handle what I'm kickin
They say I'm trippin but they stick around my room for a dickin
Cause the power of the Quiksta's too overwhelmin
And when you let me rip I'm goin in with a helmet
That's why your little brother wants to be like me
I'm surrounded by the trueness that suckers fail to see
Now 2nd II None, is you down with the Quik?  "What you think?"
Mr. Bankin, is you down with the Quik?  "Yeah, you know it"
Playa Hamm, is you down with the Quik?  "Oh but of course playa"
And everybody else.. {".. can get the dick"}
Now on my last album, I said I rolled too motherfuckin deep
That was for them suckaz that was tryin to creep
but peep the real - that when I got that murderin feelin
I can take a loss and make a killin and still be

	"America's most complete artist"
[Quik]	Fuck these punk ass niggaz!
	"you-you-you better get ready"
	"for America's most complete artist"
	"for America's most complete artist"
[Quik]	Doin much damage C-P-T style
	"for America's mo-mo-mo-mo
	 most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"
[Quik]	Yo fuck the bridge
	I better take y'all into the canal, kick it

	Mo pussy, mo pussy, mo pussy..

[DJ Quik]
Damn!  That's how a nigga like me is
True to it, ain't fakin for the showbiz
All the true ass niggaz, yup ya know this
but the others jock jockin me like they hoe is
Cause DJ Quik can be as funky as the douche
Shoot stutter steppin with pep but still I manage to givin the suckaz
the BOOT if they ask for it, because they know I flow it
Need I say more?  "NO!"  Well that's it

	"for America's most complete artist"
	"you better get ready"
	"for America's most complete artist"
		"What's your name boy?"
"I.. am.."	"America's most complete artist"
	"you better get ready"
	"for America's mo-mo-mo-mo
	 most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"</pre>
