don't stop.. (9x)

[Soopafly verse]
ey yo, I steppin in the party and the party was packed
I was like a hard heated kid didn't know how to act
I see ass shaped like burnin butter on a hot plate
most of them niggaz got one ho, I got eight
I mashed her the game, you can say I got grade
I'm runnin shit by my time so I'm not late
I track so many bitches I need a blockin
the pimpwalk in my shoes I will not trade
for one second, if I leave they go frantic
I'm just playin with you
bitch, don't panic
whatever you wish just keep that I won't gret it
patience, time, and a wallet book I don't have it
all I got time fo' is what I'm tryin fo'
a dime ho is what my game's designed fo'
you ain't really that freaky, bitch you lyin ho
now let me break it up the malls like a ryno
I fucked her from black back to albino
4:30 in the morning to about 9 o'
clock, I tryna get a bounce rock
she was like "stop!"
I was like "uh huh bitch it don't stop"

[Soopafly chorus]
in the club they call me Mr. Danger (uh huh)
moved to the city but I'm not no stranger (c'mon)
never love a bitch cuz it's not my nature (uh huh)
ho's meet the pimp, niggaz meet the gangster (yea)
put down the drink it's time to get high (uh huh)
move your body and shake what you got (ow ow)
baby take a rhone now hit to that spot (oh)
the heat hypnotize, c'mon don't stop
keep goin.. don't stop
keep goin.. don't stop
keep goin.. don't stop

[Daz verse]
as I step in the club the ho's say "oh yea"
always drop 'em in the ground cuz I'm O.G
you want some sex and affection, bitch show me
now 50 to one ho's can't every hold me
you can't immetate a nigga you can't flow me
you can't check a nigga, cuz that's on me
you keep fuckin around you be lonely
that's on my momma, my daddy you gone blow me
not you and her, it is just we
rock the cock, bitch, untill three
in the mornin I'm yawnin and then I'm outey
whatever would these ho's ever be without G
dumb, blind and stupid it's a dity
I bust ho's whether they are pretty
nigga you need some tissues cuz you shitty
she got the paw tat'd on her tit-ty
all she want is the dick she say "get me
look for my three hats I gotta give a G, me"
thick dick her how you know I ain't skinny
when it comes to long dick I get plenty
she yap like a cat she get prisky
one shot at the ho
yea, I tried to bounce rock
she said "don't stop"
hell naw, you trick bitch, it don't stop!
