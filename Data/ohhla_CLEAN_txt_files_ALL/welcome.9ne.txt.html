Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
I've landed, but which way now to go?
Cause it's Strangeland everything goes up vertical above the clouds I flow
How I got here I don't really know or remember like The Alamo
So to give me direction on this journey is big Krizz Kaliko

[Krizz Kaliko]
Now here is a beautiful world for you to enter
You can hear how we kill everyone, we're helter skelter
On this fear that is fearin' us smear tuckin the loads of us
Shear stroke of genius since we appeared out the demons
We just the lost boys like we sons of Donald Sutherland
We done strugglin' we forced our way in and forced to weigh in
The big swingin' kocks of rap r&amp;b and rock
We been seein' lots of cats copyin' ya not
Them G-O-D's and we can bless ya like we was a pastor
We past ya long ago ya concentrate on rappin' faster
This is the temple of makin' it look simple to ya'll
I wasn't really in to rap or into rap cause I seen too many falls
Why they fall for strangeland go up filled with strings of caribou lou
Fill ya cup and toss all that throw up
My team captain is you nina I'm the first lieutenant
Enjoy your visit this is strangeland that you invented

[Hook]

[Tech N9ne]
Wow
Juggalos kottonmouth kings and queens
Gangbangers metalheads and the college kids
Then everything in between
They love when tech spittin', no he's the best rippin'
Blessed this when all of these titles can equal TECHNICIAN
So let's get it in to some retro tech's vision
Complex written scripts are always sex driven
Behold us we've had it so rough so what's the slogan we have at strangeland
It goes up!
When I ask you what goes up mane if it's all good then you say that it goes
Mane if it's no, you simply just say that it don't, then I'mma label you
Foe
That's when they hit the flo' if you hatin in my land we can throw
But I prefer with drinkin' 'bou lou that's cold
Then hit the vertical path and get on these hoes
I love it Eep Op Ork Ah Ah
Even if your brand new come knee shock your faja
And I'm lookin' for the girls with them deep bra's more tatas
On the vertical then get horizontal then I'mma beat up your nana

[Hook]
