Typed by: brownsugar@bignetsouth.net

[Intro]
Talk about me talk about me talk about me, talk
Ta talk about me talk about me talk about me, talk
Talk about me talk about me talk about me, talk
Ta talk about me talk about me talk about me, talk

[Verse 1]
Everytime, I turn, around
I'm always hearing somebody
Tryin ta put me down
They try to say, that I'm this that I'm that
But all they while, they talkin they don't know me like that
Its a crying shame what some people do
They always saying stuff about you, that ain't even true
So if you think, you got something, you wanna say
Why don't you build the nerve and come say to my face

[Chorus]
And stop talkin about me(talkin bout me)
Behind my back(oh)
If you got something to say
Why you say it like that
Stop talkin about me (talkin about me)
Behind my back(yeah)
If you got something to say won't you just say that
Stop talking about me
Behind my back
If you got something to say 
Why you say it like that(like that)
Stop talkin about me
Behind my back
If you got something to say want you just say just say that

[Verse 2]
You betta watch , who you call, your friends
They come around, when you get paid to help spend up your ends
Kind of funny, when you don't get strong
They talk about you, like a dog to their friends on the phone
Its a crying shame what some people say
Some times I think that they wanna just take my place
So why your talkin about somebody else
You need to take the time to try to straightin yourself

[Chorus]

Repeat intro

[Bridge]
Every time I turn around, you
Talk about me
Every time I come around, you
Talk about me
Every time I put it down, you
Talk about me 
Every time I look around, you
Talk 
Stop tallin about me....

[Chorus]
