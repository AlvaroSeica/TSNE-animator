[Intro - Cha Cha] 
Remix, Hah, yeah, hah, yeah, Cha Cha 
(I didn't kiss you there) Shae Jones 
(I didn't scratch you there) '99 
Talk show shhh... 
(I didn't touch you there) 
Remix y'all, you know 
Yeah, yeah, uh huh what? 
(Is it here you wanna be with?) 
Uh, uh huh 
(You've got me involved in some talk show shh..) 
Yeah, what what 
Uh, uh, uh come on 

[Shae] (Cha Cha)
Baby, baby, baby 
Who the hell you messin' wit? 
Tryin' to play me for a fool 
The other day I followed you 
(Yeah, I followed you)
I saw you talking with that trick you used to see 
(I know...)
But before you start explaining 
Let me say what's killing me 
(What, what)

1 - 	[Shae]
	I didn't kiss you there 
	I didn't scratch you there 
	I didn't touch you there 
	Is it her you wanna be with? 
	You got me involved in some talk shhh... 

[Shae] (Cha Cha)
What ya hiding baby? (uh-huh)
Showering by yourself (mmm)
Tippin' around the candles like you don't want me to see 
You can't deny, that's not my lipstick on your shirt
Not my scratch marks, not my perfume
You don't know how much that hurts (heh, for real)

[Shae]
(He say) baby trust me, I'm not cheatin', no
(She say) tell me who's that bitch you're seeing
(Why oh why oh why) you've got our business in the streets
Can I get a witness, what (what, what) what 
Its like's we're on TV 

Repeat 1

[Cha Cha] 
Cha Cha, ah ah 
Bet you ain't know, I know what I know 
When I don't find in the streets
Most time with the chrome shine, what 
I ain't supposed to be boring mind 
Been a long time under the whole 9 
Just play the cool until you co-sign 
So fine, make the note mine 
Bezel Benz lace with the froze tie 
When you woke me up from a closed line 
Both times got caught up in a slow grind 
No crying 'cause I ain't got no time 
Don't mind hittin' streets 
Before dime, I was gettin' mine during the whole time 
Now everything I own is mine 
Baby boy I'm still gon' grind 
Leave me alone, you can take the home 
Even though it still is mine 
Go ahead, take the dog 
Thinkin' you gon' be wit' a broad and save it all 
Well I ain't gone till you gave it all 
Tearin' me off my favorite part 
Easy till you made it hard 
Cheatin' on, how haters are 
Playin' with cuffs just ain't enough 
Until you bust and you gotta say it all 
I'm gon' take it all, before I break it off 
Don't play at all, can't play at all 
Can a player talk on a player's card? 
'Cause you dealin' with a broad with player's stars 
Is you wit that, 'cause I'm gettin' everything 
Can you split that, 'cause you ain't gettin' that 
Hope you feelin' that 
For the last time, where the scrilla at? 

Repeat 1 while:
[Shae]
You're putting me through the ringer
Surprised I'm not on Jerry Springer
I should be with my girls, and single
Wanna be with
In some talk show...
No, that's not my shade of lipstick
Nor my scratch marks on your back
Is her that you wanna be with?
You got me involved in some talk show shhh...</pre>
