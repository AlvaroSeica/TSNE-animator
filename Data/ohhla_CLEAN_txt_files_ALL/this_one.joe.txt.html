[Chorus: Joe Mafia]
This one, for them fake cats, fronting like it's all love
Running round, thinking shit sweet, yo
This one, for them words that wanna break my stride
Canive, smile and they wish I died, yo
This one, for them niggas with scared money amongst me
That love to see me bleeding in the street, though
This one, for them crackers trynna beat me 'cross the head
With that bullshit, it's on the heart, yo, this one

[Joe Mafia]
Fuck rap nigga, straight off the record
I hold western, stink and petty get you cough in me
Lollypop kids do bids, and come home willing
Third stripe pending felongs, pumping on wellon
Niggas talk more than bitches, wooly poot niggas
Suit niggas, straight tie and suit niggas, shoot niggas
Pissy drunk, dice games in the bootleg of this one
Stack your funds, hold guns, and school bitches, duke, listen
Ain't nothing new, I seen your kind before, do the math
Fuck you got a screwface for? You a candy ass
Cash ya ass off a couple of packs, palm spitting
Million dollar raps relax, my name ringing
Jingling, got strength, plus ya mob respects, and nines and techs
All my real niggas dead or in the state correct', keep the cake correct
Bang the shit up in your whip until you break your neck
Niggas straight up respect, dude, sorry, I got money
It's funny, after fucking with you, fronting with crumsb, see
Edward Scissorhands, your plans, and snatch ass with it
I left you warning with a dun, and cats, it's best opinion

[Chorus]

[Joe Mafia]
I got that fire and I ain't fronting with it
If you ain't down with this, then you ain't fucking with it
That's how I feel for real, ain't nothing else to that, but
Drugs and sluts, you can get touched
Niggas need to collapse, slash, the Cash Rule
Divine ruled, universal twerking, networking
Fool got something to prove, moving out fast
No doubt'll blow out, get your wig blown out
Up inside a house, four thousand and a chrome out
Trey pizzy, under the T, la smoke out
Tank cats deserve curves, they cheating, yo
And I ain't satisfied til niggas is eating, yo
Get it from the rough, scoop it up, recoup
Snatch pies from the chicken coup, we rule, get it in the duke shoe
Whipmaster, what they call me
Hit 'em with a nina of... if they call me

[Chorus]

[Joe Mafia]
I do this with a jones, like I'm strung out and need a fix
On some real shit, dog, you frog, nigga, eat a dick
How you cross me up and butt, like I ain't see the shit
City slicker, uptown gift, I ain't for no pimping
Fucker, friend all up in my shit, you ain't gorilla
Greener than a head of cabbage, faggot ass rap nigga
Caught up in the mix, cuz, get tricked up
All out for this one, doing them dirty, damn to get them
In the hood with backwoods, all good, lace your Timbs up
Trump hold a Massberg pump, while I get slumped
Broad day, hustling in hallways, a stress pump
Official missile, shutting it down, if your shit slump
Niggas catching licks with six bitches, who kicks fucking
Crab clicks posing as dicks, stick to the script, cousin
Scrape it up, so we can cake it up, and get the spot jumping
Nigga, I done seen it and done it, run it, this one
