[Intro/Chorus: Cee-Lo]
I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
and I'm like, "FUCK you!" (Ooo-ooo-OOH)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "FUCK you and-ah, FUCK her too!"
I said, "If I was richer, I'd still be with ya"
Ha, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
with a... FUCK you! (Ooo-ooo-OOH)

[First Verse]
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
Huh, I guess he's an Xbox, and I'm more Atari
Mmm, but the way you play your game ain't fair

Uh, I pity the FOOOOOL-HOOOO that falls in love with you, oh oh
(Oh shit, she's a gold digger) Well
(Just thought you should know, nigga)
OOOO-OO-OOO-OOOOOH, I've got some news for you, huh-hah
Yeah, gone and run tell ya lil' boi-friend

[Chorus]

[Second Verse]
Now I know, that I had to borrow
Hah, beg and steal and lie and cheat, ah
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap

Naw, I pity the FOOOOOL-HOOOO that falls in love with you, oh oh
(Oh shit, she's a gold digger) 
Well (Just thought you should know, nigga)
OOOO-OO-OOO-OOOOOH, I've got some news for you, huh-hah
OOH~!!! I really hate yo' ass right now

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Now baby, baby, baby
Why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so baaaad)
I tried to tell my momma, but she told me,
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad) Yes she did
And I was like, uh! Whhhhhy?
Uh! Whhhhhhhy?! UH! WHHHHHHHY, LADYYYY?
OH! I love you! OH! I +STILL+ LOVE YOOOOOU, OHHHHHHHH~!
