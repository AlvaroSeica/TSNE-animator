[Fes Taylor]
Aiyo, my homey bought a new five, he told me 'take a ride'
Threw me the keys, he said 'you drive'
I hopped inside, pushed the seat back, gangsta leaning
Doing 85 down the streets, speeding
He said 'pull over, let me run in the bank, get some more cash
Keep the engine running, I be out real fast'
He came out with two bags, I was like 'oh shit'
Hopped in the passenger seat, and told me 'go quick'
Security guard shot out the back window
Got me mad nervous, pulling out the indo'
See lights flashing, cops in back of us, yelling 'pull over'
Fire coming out the gun, son, like it's a flame thrower
I made a quick left, quick right, trying to lose 'em
My man hanging out the side window, trying to shoot 'em
Started aiming for the tires, police car, flipped over
Caught on fire, if you get caught, they gon' fry us
Blew a red light, I almost smashed into a truck
Bullets flew through the windshield, hit son, before he ducked
He said 'I'm alright, slug only went through my arm'
Started breathing real fast, told a nigga 'be calm'
Blood soaking his Phat Farm, got me really bugging out
Turn ourself in? Hell no, we gon' thug it out
Made a u-turn, damn, son, they still on our ass
My face all cut up, from all the shattered glass
My man looking like he doing bad, ain't gon' make it
Told me that the pain too much, he can't take it
Last I remember, trying to bust through a road block
Now I'm in the hospital, handcuffed and shot</pre>
