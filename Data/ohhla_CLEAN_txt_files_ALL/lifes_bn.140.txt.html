Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Toilet (Shawn Wigs)]
I got a mansion as big as fuck
(Big body Benz and a Escalade truck)
I live in hotels, tear down the walls
(Get my accountant to pay for it all)
They say I'm crazy, but I have a good time
Life's been good to me, so far

[Shawn Wigs]
You can't understand that, read between the lines
On the Ferry with two dimes, Dutch and a shoeshine
Change, change, change, change, change, rewind
Chunky like fucking an ear
Here me coming, chain swing wild when I'm running
Rocks like golf balls, chains like tow truck change
See me with the Lord in the Range
Talking money, putting them O's in the bank
It's no limits, you liable to see me with Tom Hanks
On some Big shit, Notorious like Smalls
Years in the game, put plaques on the wall
This been good to me, living days off padium
Smoking at shows, til I can't wait to see 'em
Got money out the ass, seed in the lab
Food for thought, that'll cut by the slab

[Chorus: Toilet (Shawn Wigs)]
Life's been good to me, so far
(My Big Benz, does 185)
I lost my license, and I'm suppose to drive
(Still push them 20's, twist leafs of the green
Diamonds around my neck and the biggest car screen)
Still making records, my fans they can't wait
(They write me letters, say 'nigga, you're great')
So I got me an office, putting platinum on the walls
(Just leave a voicemail, and maybe I'll call)
Lucky I'm the same after all I've been through
Life's been good to me, so far

[Shawn Wigs]
So far, so good, jewels rocky like the Mountains
Big money on the house, condon in the fountains
Cigar room, smoke til I'm green like Grinch
Sluggas, me and big Dottie on the sixty inch
Sony, PS2, L.S.U.'s
Luxuries, sport utility, my capability is endless
Drink on the road, I'm relentless
Smoke til I'm out of my senses
So far, I earn my respect in the streets
So far, the ghetto's been good to me
So far, I'm never gonna turn my back
Let's eat, shop til my credit cards maxed</pre>
