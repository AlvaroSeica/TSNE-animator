What's everybody fighting for?
To each his own in other war
What's everybody lightning off?
Not the rocket off your shore

Say people, do you really want to know the name
Of the man and the massacre gonna bring you pain?
And if you want a ten then you'd realize
That you are the one to blame

For all the funny things you used to say
And all your hopes and dreams have slipped away
Say all you got to do is step on through
Before you give yourself away

Oh, they don't wanna hurt you or take you away
'Cos ever since you leave
And they say you're wrong
And that's why you're gone and I see

And you don't wanna lose, do you?
It's never part of the plan
Everybody got the same old story
Another man or a different woman

On a Monday, on a Tuesday
Another Wednesday, all the way to Saturday
If you call me, say you wanna come play
I'll call you back say never wanna [?]

Oh, they don't wanna hurt you or take you away
And ever since you leave
And they say you're wrong
And that's why you're gone and I see

Oh, you don't wanna lose, do you?
It's never part of your plan
Everybody got the same old story
Just another man or a different woman</pre>
