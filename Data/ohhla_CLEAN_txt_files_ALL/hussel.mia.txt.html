[Afrikan Boy]
Hello, ay-ya!
Hello, ay-ya!
 
[M.I.A.]
Oooooh, ah-ah-ahhhhhhhhhh!
Oooooh, ah-ah-ahhhhhhhhhh!
 
[M.I.A. - Verse 1]
We do it cheap, hide our money in the heap
Send it home and make 'em study, fixing teeth
I got family, a friend in need
A hand to throw the gasoline
A mobile phone, hooked-up to the scene
Hello, my friend - yes, it's me!
Don't be scared, there's somethin' going on
I'm gettin' money, since I've grown
Could be dash, go out and hustle 'em!
But, I hate money 'cause it makes me numb

[M.I.A - Chorus 2x's]
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Grind, grind, grind
Why does everyone got hustle on their mind?

[Afrikan Boy - Bridge 5x's]
You think its tough now?
Come to Africa!

[Afrikan Boy - Verse 2]
Out there, we are grinding like pep-pay (pepper)
You can catch me on the motorway
Sellin' sugar, water and pep-pay
I rep Africa, not Mi-a-mi
Hustle, hustle with M.I.A.
I'm broke, I've got indefinite stay
You can't touch me like leprosy
I hustle here, from here to Sri Lanka
My mom told me to be an accountant
Bun, that I wanna' work in a corner shop
Contact Sugu - he's got the contacts, mayne!
I'm illegal - I don't pay tax-tax!
EMA - yes, I'm claiming that-that!
Police, I try to avoid them
They catch me hustling they say, Deport them!

[M.I.A - Chorus 2x's]
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Grind, grind, grind
Why does everyone got hustle on their mind?
 
[M.I.A.]
Ugh! Afrikan Boy!
You know I'm big in Mozambique!
Hey-hey!

[M.I.A.  Hook 2x's]
Hello, my friend! 
Hello, my friend!
Hello, my friend! 
Yes, it's me!

[M.I.A.  Verse 3]
4 by 3, 3 buy 3
Buy 1 song, get 1 free
Maybe me, a bootleg CD
Color TV or a DVD
We got barrels in the sea
It's big enough to take a whole family
We drum on it
Like jun cha cha ju gu ju gu cha!
Jun cha cha ju gu ju gu cha!
Come sit by me, let me tell you we
Don't do bling, but we do white-tee
Up some jungle, up some tree
One second, my phone's ringing
Its my friend, Habibi
He then went drop, called me
Cheap Moroccan, got no credit than me
Ya'll got less credit than me
I keep that tab at a shop like a G
'Cause without me, there'll be no chocolate Hershey!

[M.I.A - Chorus 6x's]
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Grind, grind, grind
Why does everyone got hustle on their mind?</pre>
