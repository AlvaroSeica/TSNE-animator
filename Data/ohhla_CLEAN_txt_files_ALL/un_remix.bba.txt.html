[J57]
On the real/reel I drop a hook with a strong line close to me
Big fish, small pond mentality won't float with me
Caught takin' the bait, mistake is known to be
This industry is over-flooded, still they don't flow like me
And the drummer is a doctor in the audible
Out of every new producer; we the shit, they horrible
There's money on your head so don't forget I told ya
Ill bills leave you slaine, lethal like La Coka Nostra

[Koncept]
Koncept complex always spittin complicated
try to touch the mic, your life is what I confiscated
don't always have to crush it, but I feel obligated raw talent
cause your balance, not related
alter ego's hidden in the dark like Clark Kent
art tends to be on walls, stalls and a park bench
spark gems, you coming close is far fetched
we always in the light, your just there to bartend

[The Audible Doctor scratches]
"If it's hot, it's undeniable
what you need to do is step back
only way you take my spot is with a shot
bend you in half and drink a genuine draft
br-br-br-br-b-brown bag"
2x

[Soul Khan]
Now, wait a pussy-lickin' second
I could be gettin' naked
with the woman of your dreams
but it seems I've been elected
as the, grand inquisitor on behalf of listeners
who want back the half a chance that they've given ya
beg for forgiveness
professor of slickness
who the fuck made rap the Special Olympics?
here's a suggestion for you corny weak posers
you wanna be doper? get a forty leaf clover

[The Audible Doctor]
Truthfully I'm off the rocker like how bouncers pull on groupies
see we move with speed equivalent to cheetahs when it's time to feed
and I don't need, your support I'll be doing this for free
even if there's no money involved, you'll still be seeing me
weaving through bars like cats on a packed train car
I stay far from those who look the part but can't flip flows
you fly like an with it's wings clipped
we came to bring it to the next level with every song we sing kid

[The Audible Doctor scratches]
"If it's hot, it's undeniable
what you need to do is step back
only way you take my spot is with a shot
bend you in half and drink a genuine draft
br-br-br-br-b-brown bag"
