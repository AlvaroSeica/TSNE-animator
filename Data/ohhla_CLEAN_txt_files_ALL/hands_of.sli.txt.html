Song:   Hands of Time
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You know them people be strugglin' every day
You got to get up, get out and move your body line today
Say listen to me people said I've got to tell you something true
And don't be falsified by what others want you to do
It took forever just to chase you
It took a second to replace you
But i will not bother and disgrace you
And send you to the judge and let him case you
Time has left you behind
Time wont let you be mine
Maintain me soul and me say maintain me mind
Time is the master and the master is time
Yes these are the hands of time
Yes these are the hands of time
Deciever __ and this will leave her
Yes these are the hands of time
Yes these are the hands of time
Yes you will melt in this time
Time has left you you say so far behind
Yes these are the hands of time
Yes these are the hands of time
Yes these are the hands of time</pre>
