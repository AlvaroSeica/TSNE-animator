Song:   Take Me Away
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Take me away (way way way way way way)
Take me away (way way way way way way)
Take me away (way way way way way way)
Pick your plant it, break it, roll it, blow it, then you gone away
Pick your plant it, break it, roll it, blow it, then you gone away

5, 4, 3, 2,1 , Blunts blast off
Pick your plant it, roll it, toke it, smoke it, the we blast off
I probably be on Mars when I light up
Clean up and head down to Venus, to get wiped up
The liquor make me want to go to Pluto to get (iced up)
Race, in space

So damn these colors vibrant
I'm going on a trip without luggage
But this baggage says I bagged it
If the police see I have it, flash the badge, and they'll tie it and take

Take me away (way way way way way way)
Take me away (way way way way way way)
Take me away (way way way way way way)
Pick your plant it, break it, roll it, blow it, then you gone away
Pick your plant it, break it, roll it, blow it, then you gone away</pre>
