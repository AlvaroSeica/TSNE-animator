[8 Ball]
Yeah..
What'chu talkin 'bout, what'chu think you doin?
Why you walkin out, where you think you goin?
You actin like you didn't, you knew what I was doin
3 o'clock in the mornin, you knew where I was goin
Straight to my spot, a loft in the city
Stopped and picked up somethin pretty on the freeway suckin titties
You in the bed sleepin, I said that I was workin
You smile when you see me but inside you was hurtin
The cars and the clothes, whatever that you asked me
I was takin care of you, I thought that you was happy
Out of town, fuckin 'round, all-star, Superbowl
A-T-L, Magic City, tippin big dick hoes
Panties on the back seat, I don't know whose shit that is
Condoms and phone numbers, I don't know whose shit that is
F'real, you know when I realized that I was wrong
When I wrote the words to this song

[Chorus: unnamed singer]
Just tell me why baby, did I ever did I ever did I ever let you go baby
Cause I love you cause I love you cause I really love you so baby
Baby, woo - it's the very last time that I'll let you down
I won't make the same mistakes again

[MJG]
Yeah, since way back I was a mag-a-net for pretty women
And brought up in the city where they exercise their pimpin
I fight temptation daily, I could be in Paris chillin
With somethin young, eager talent, they ready and willin
I get a lot of phone numbers but don't really call 'em
Unless I hit 'em just to let 'em know I'm out here ballin
I know you picture me, laid up with these other women
Most of the time I'm not, occasionally I get 'em
Who was that woman lookin at me up in Wal*Mart
Lock in the sexual fantasy, her drawers hot
But back to the subject, the chemistry I really loved it
Mental, emotional, couldn't put nothin above it
But every unturned stone you had to touch it
Rolled 'em over, look what you found, now you disgusted
But before I leave, look me in my eye
Don't cry, never lie..

[Chorus]

[8 Ball]
You and me, full of that, sticky weed and cog-nac
You like how I lick it then, put the dick up in your back
There you go, talkin 'bout, what you know, who done said
that they saw me trickin some-where with one of yo' friends
Did you see me do it NO, do you know that shit fo' sho'
Who you gon' believe me, or them ol' meddlin hoes
Daaaamn, I think of all the shit I put you through
This a lonely game and, sometimes I be missin you

[MJG]
I got a tank of gas to burn up, turn up the radio
Baby hit your girls, go tell 'em c'mon get ready to go
We headed fo', somewhere, tucked in and very low key
No interruptions, no cell phones, no tee-vee
Just you and me, sippin up on some Hennessy
Makin sure that we finish the whole, cup to the end it be
meant to be chemistry between us and even though
you saw the bitches in my Beamer..

[Chorus] - to fade</pre>
