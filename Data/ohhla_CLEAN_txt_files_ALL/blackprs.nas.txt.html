[Barack Obama - taken from victory speech in Iowa] 
They said this day would never come... {*crowd cheers loudly*}
They SAID, our sights were set too high. {*crowd still wooing*}
This country is too divided; too disillusioned 
to ever come together around a common purpose. They said..."

[Repeat 2X]
("Although it seems heaven-sent, 
we ain't ready, to have a black president"
