This is easy Sunday morning
We're right here on a beautiful morning in
Cleveland, Ohio
And it's chilly today
Kids are going to school
The grass is frosty

Verse 1: Chip The Ripper

This should be my
Theme song
To Life, Haha

A nigga like me be so gone
Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
Wonder what them folks on?
Thats what they be askin
That kush we smokes on
Smell it when a nigga pass and
We gettin' to cash and
You can see a nigga shinin
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple 2-3 diamonds
Up in the hood where you find em
Unless he out on the road
Every show got a bag for the blow and Patron all my niggas getting throwed
Like they posed to
Cause life is short
And filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out and free my scalp
I mean free my mind, a puff a time
I'm up all the time
I'm up on the grind
So a Red bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, Just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Dont really like sippin' cuz I get to trippin'
my nigga just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a lil bit for the trip
in case we get blurped by the 5-0 (Sir you look high)
I know but I prefer my eyes low

CHORUS:

And we get hyyerr, and hyyerr, and hyyerr, and hyyerr (x2)
You know we get hyyerr, and hyyerr, and hyyerr, and hyyerr (x2)
You know we get hyyerr, so hyyerrrrrrrrrrrr
oOoooooooooooOo, yeahhhwe get so highhhhhh

Verse 2: Kid Cudi
Yeahhh
They say easy friend
There he go talking about weed again
Probably cause all that weed in him
Yes and no, cause and effect is what most don't know
Doin' bad, or like Mike said could be doin' wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
but your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and
Tag alonggggggggg.
And we float.....
We kids with hope
better to cope when you smoke
Dawg.. please don't miss... what
a nigga trying to get you thinkin' bout
We outside because my mama in the house
Puff, puff, pass with your bitch ass
Back in high school, smoke weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict
Tragic, stay rolling up while reclining
Happy, lookin' down, see my jesus piece shinin'
Good look, Yeezy
Now I stay blinded by that light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right
Yes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me
I'll be chillin' back, I'll be chillin' jack
Let's goooo.

CHORUS:

And we get hyyerr, and hyyerr, and hyyerr, and hyyerr (x2)
You know we get hyyerr, and hyyerr, and hyyerr, and hyyerr
You know we get hyyerr, so hyyerrrrrrrrrrrr, oOoooooooooooOo, yeahh we get
so highhhhhh</pre>
