The taste of this joint

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, does it taste strong?

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, does it taste strong?

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, does it taste strong?

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali

Let's take a plane up out to Philly
We flying out to Dallas
Someone I'm meeting __ is
Handing in it the chalice
Some premil, we come play
We getting the weed from Cali
And rolling it up in Philly
Smoking weed up all day
Now they say they come playing, really
And I really need to hear it
...
You now that we would not get near
No ordinary sensimilla
And the only thing they wanted
When the kryptonite is gone
We started smoking supersonic
If you got money to pay
Better put your money on it
A __ they go on and on and on and on
And they say they never feel it
But we're smoking this 'semilli
No __ needed
When I'm high I don't conceal it
Everything is okay, this joint

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, does it taste strong?

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, does it taste strong?

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, does it taste strong?

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali

Smoked up all my weed from Philly
And everything from Cali
I'm all up and I'm by you
Smoking the kind of Maui-wowi
Pakalolo, grade A
We call to the Carribean
Deliver it up but their seeking
All connections get paid
Different strap for every season
If you really need a reason
We light the kryptonite and I open red bull
Lighten b's, more than ounce or two of chronic
In the end it's what we needed
No artificial flavor, then they come
Oh no no, we said, come and let the music play
And __ repeat it
Perfection, I go on and on and on and on
I've been from Minnesota
From there onto Daytona
We come from up in New York
Now up in Cali, superfona
Everything is okay, this joint

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, does it taste strong?

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, does it taste strong?

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, does it taste strong?

We rolling it up from Philly
And I need all the weed from Cali</pre>
