[Intro from Chopper movie when Chopper shot Nevil]

[Necro]
Rugged like Pentridge Prison where Chopper was started
inflicting vingical insisions on inmates
with cool blades home made scissors
I'll teach you how too shoot friends and influence people
happyness is one gun but nine represents evil
the most feared underworld exicutioner
stab you in the neak its a grussem conclusion
a bloody nosense and need a transfusion for ya
mass confusion I'll blurt if you ask your choice of the course
study this your in a pool of blood like piss
dyin you sliped dummy you forgot what thuglife is
reading the crime memoirs candidly confessin to murder
also my torcher might gladly teach you a lession
a head hunter, leavin you cunts dead out the front
with a sawn off double brarrel shot gun lead thumper
if I fall get up holding a gat baby
the opera ain't over 'til someone shoots the fuckin fat lady

[Chorus: Chopper Read]
Get in do it and get out blood free
walk up bang bang step back quick
when the blood hits the floor I'm six feet away
hit 'em hard hit 'em fast and get out quick
Get in do it and get out blood free
walk up bang bang step back quick
when the blood hits the floor I'm six feet away
hit 'em hard hit 'em fast and get out quick

[Necro]
You're not thinking clear motherfucker your stinkin of fear
you get chopped in the head
or fuckin shot dead while drinkin beer
dont give a fuck if theres alot of you
bust a shot, I got at you
paid heaps to have motherfuckers bite at you
I'm popular, for poppin shit off
probably gettin pissed off
and punchin you in the face properly
possably my enemies thoght I got shot
but I'm walkin around phisicly intact
and your not
I got a bullet with your name on it
I don't see you dodgin it
unless some how you get ya brain armored
you get whacked in this chess game
death game pawns rooks kights bishops crooks
stick up throgh you chest frame
you dumb fags I like to you dumb hags
I like to laugh drink bet and shoot skumbags
I'm just a regular bloke goin for broke
at ya jugular throt bang it up the blood makes you choke

[Chorus]

[Outro: Chopper Read]
"I used to sell 'em their left leg
I used to say give me some money or ya see ya left leg
That leg belongs to me I'll take it with me when I'm going
Then I said if you want that left leg this is what its gonna cost ya
Ya know and I'll pull out a gun...... and aim at their kneecap"</pre>
