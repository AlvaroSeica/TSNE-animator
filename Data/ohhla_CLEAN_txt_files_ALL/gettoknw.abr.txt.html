[Intro]
Yo, you know this guy Abraham?
Yo, you seen this dude around?
Yo, who is this cat, man?

[Chorus]
Hey, get to know me
Oh, I know that dude, Abraham
Hey, get to know me
Yeah, I've seen him around, man
Hey, get to know me
I've seen his business cards up on the subway
Hey, get to know me
I heard he got some rhymes or something
Hey, get to know me
But what's he really like?
Hey, get to know me
Like, you've seen him in real life?
Hey, get to know me

(v1)
Last night I saw him buying some fruit
Ten minutes later he was trying to puke
20 minutes later he's applying to duke
Now, that's not true, now I'm lying to you
He's dying to nuke everything in the room
An iron, a siren, a lion, a zoo
He's spying on truth
He's eyeing the youth
Denying the cute
He's quiet and mute
Last night I saw him tryin on boots
Off to the army, a crying recruit
I'm like, "Dude, what you tryin to prove?"
He looked at me and said, "I look fly in a suit."
Now that ain't a fact I'm a try and refute
He lives in a temple, he'll die in a pew
I mentioned this sentence
He finally flew off the three train and became shy and obtuse

[Chorus]
Hey, get to know me
Oh, that cat Abraham
Hey, get to know me
Yeah, I've seen him at some open-mics
Hey, get to know me
Yo, he freestyles about the crowd?
Hey, get to know me
Yo that cat is buck wild
Hey, get to know me
For real
Hey, get to know me
He wears a green hat, right?
Hey, get to know me
Big nose?

[Verse 2]
He plays monopoly sloppily
All his properties fail
They got him in jail
His pimples spell 'cocky' in braille
Everything about him is extra-curricular
He's in the library next to Bunnicula
He breaks wind when wearin a windbreaker
Throwin back more shots than Vin Baker
He float em
Sendin messages just like a modem
Most want it faster, he hopes he can slow em
On top of the totem poll there ain't no know it all
The chief is resting on the bottom right below em
How could he show em?
He's seen different scenery
Than rappers in the past whose only vision of greenery's
The herb that they smoke
You heard he's a joke?
Sometimes he comes across as much softer than he means to be
It's seems to be to that people's assumptions are really something
You think that smoking helps him rap?
Well it doesn't
If he smokes some bud with a mixture of leaves
He'll rhyme cheesier than people in pictures saying cheese
Got you prayin, "Please!
Make this kid stop!
Make this kid drop the mic and give it up!"
But he's gone live it up
He's not gonna glisten
The standard is glamour
He wants you to listen
He taunts you with dissonance and with instruments
He's an incident of straight vision

[Chorus]
Hey, get to know me
Oh, Jesse Abraham
Hey, get to know me
Yeah, I know that guy
Hey, get to know me
He's like a teacher or something?
Hey, get to know me
And he's lactose intolerant
Hey, get to know me
He's got hairy arms
Hey, get to know me
And he's from Manhattan
Hey, get to know me
But he claims Brooklyn anyway

[Verse 3]
Well you take the A-B
The C-D skips then you add on a E
360 degrees
I'm the noblest poet this planet has ever seen
Or maybe even heard about
Never went the murder route
I'll make you wanna turn around
"Yo, who is that?!"
Abraham's right smack in the middle of the pack
You wanna ask why, ask us
We'll intersect like the X-Y axis
Damn! That boy is so, um
Man! What's that word I'm thinking of?
Well, it don't matter what badge ya give me
There ain't no way that you can adjective me
Accurately
I jump out the box like I'm Jack or I'm jacked up from bumping some rocks
Something I'm not is predictable
Right?

[Chorus]
Hey, get to know me
OK, now I know who you're talking about
Hey, get to know me
Yeah man, that dude's aright
Hey, get to know me
You know, I heard him rhyme
Hey, get to know me
And he's got some shit, wordup
Hey, get to know me
For real
Hey, get to know me
Left fielding it a little bit but
Hey, get to know me
You know, he's just outside the box
Hey, get to know me
That's just how it goes
Hey, get to know me</pre>
