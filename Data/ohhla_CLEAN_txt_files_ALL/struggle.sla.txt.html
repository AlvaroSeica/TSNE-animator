[Crooked I]
Lord!

Uh, I'm havin +Rob a Nigga Thoughts+ like the Horseshoe
Got all the tools in my box, I'm a nut missin a corkscrew
Sittin on my porch thinkin this rappin ain't gon' happen
Cause faggots rappin that like I'm the wrong nigga to pass the torch to
Momma stressin cause her rent's due
Can't borrow money from none of the homies, them niggaz in a pinch too
My co-connect, he got pinched too
Andy Dufresne escapin Shawshank, the shit I been through (Lord!)
Refrigerator empty, inner anger in me simply 
waitin to incubatin for if a hater tempt me
I'ma disintegrate him quickly
Spray the .380 'til bullets penetrate his kidney
Sometimes I just wanna fall asleep in the tub loaded on drugs like I was imitatin Whitney
Talk to God, just pray that he forgive me
and sleep, rest, depressed, I been stressin
Weight of the world on my chest, like I'm bench pressin
the planet, I get dressed, on a one-man mission
Hopped in my bucket with a bad transmission, my hands itchin
Yeah I'm past bitchin and complainin, and I ain't tryin to land in nobody's damn prison
But I gotta take a chance, man listen
My pops was a magician like David Blaine
mixed with a mime, he disappeared, didn't say a thang
Nigga bounced out, out to Hutchinson, Kansas
Now I gotta find out where this fuck nigga pants is
Man of the house, threw on his trousers
Nothin like a child in them pedophile browsers
But still a child lost his innocence and a frown lived where the smile did
Snatch purses and rap verses, I was a wild kid
Fast forward to this gun in your face
Mouth covered in tape, I want what's in your safe
I want you to resist
So I can take all of my anger out on someobdy who ain't got nuttin to do with this shit! (Lord!)

[Chorus: Crooked I]
You don't know about the struggles in this bitch
Late at night, stomach growlin while you cuddle with your bitch
And they tell me I would even go through troubles if I'm rich
But I'd rather have somethin - cause havin nothin is a bitch (Lord!)

[Interlude: Crooked I]
La la-la la la lahhh
You don't know about the struggles in this bitch (Lord!)
La la-la la la lahhh
You don't know about the struggles in this bitch (Lord!)

[Crooked I]
God bless the child that got his own, let's see
I ain't got nothin, I wonder will God bless me?
I ain't sayin bein rich'll make me stress-free
But I'd rather see what that do while I'm on my jet skis (Lord!)
Yeah right, I'm hungry e'ry night
And I never smile, got my poker face air tight
Down on my knees accidentally usin profanity
I can't even say a prayer right - I just want a pair of Nikes
I just wanna wear a white tee and keep my hair tight
I just want a fair fight, I just want a fair life!
Is that too much to ask for?
Tell me is that too much to ask for?
