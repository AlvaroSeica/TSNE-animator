When the sunshine showed her face I felt like I was ready to die
Went looking for a place to hide, a hole I could crawl inside
Long lines, whiskey bottles, and the same old song
I smell death in the air, and I know it won't be long

And I could say I'm trying to change but that's just another lie
It's been a day and a half and I'm still high

And I feel like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
Like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
J-J-Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
Like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin' through my veins

When the daylight disappeared, I took a good look inside
Behind my pride, I sat down and cried
I know I'm not a fool, but I don't know what's wrong
Maybe it's time to pack and just move on

And I could say I'm trying to change but that's just another lie
I'm looking for someone to tell me why

And I feel like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
Like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
J-J-Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin'
Like Jackson Mississippi, a river runnin' through my veins

A river runnin', a river runnin' through my veins
A river runnin' a through my veins
A river that's runnin' through my veins</pre>
