[Intro]
Rock me tonight, for old time sake
Roll with me tonight, for old time sake

[Chorus]
It's a slow jam, so we can hold hands
I can touch your hips to the slow jam
And if you feeling this put your cellphones high and we can slow dance by the cellphone light

[Uno]
You lames beat box, and I box beats
You like to slang white and I like to cop white
I'm not talking dope baby, I'm talking ice
Sky's the limit girl, shoot to the top
If you miss baby, you'll land on me
I'm a star born, yeah hop in my car
Like old times, remember them good days, shopping till the mall close, ballin' like spalding

[Hook]
Remember old times just you and me, we use to ball out
just you and me, for old time sake, keep the memories
hold em tight baby, hold em tight baby. [x2]

[Young L]
Rock with chu boy, yeah for old time sake
She my ride or die chick when I grind for the cake, plus she got that cake like everyday her birthday
She come from the same soil
Bay Area, my birth place
My chick beautiful I never see a hurt face
(Never) She got a brain, and you know that I'm in 1st place
Go bad, then you probably in the worse place
Think before you let it go, I'm touching on the first date

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[B]
I can ya, when you mess with a young boss
People hate S.S baby, but chu love that
And she love rap, I told her when I get a mill, I'll cash momma out
You aint got to eat a mill, that's what I'm about
And that new E-Class I'm in G-Class
And they don't know about the boy, I get a free pass
Rep S.S until the day I breath last. (You Know)

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Stunna]
She wanna roll with me, she see me in the Benz, I let the top down, figure hair in the wind
I got money baby, yeah we can spend
And I aint hatin' girl, yeah bring a couple of friends
She wanna rock and roll, but I roll and rock
I got A game, knock you out chu socks
I'm a hood figure, still watching for the cops
But I'm a get chu wet, something like baywatch

[Hook]

[Chorus]</pre>
