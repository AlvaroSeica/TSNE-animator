Typed by: AZ Lyrics

THE BOB MARLEY GETS US SUPER-DUPER HIGH!
THE BOB MARLEY GETS US SUPER-DUPER HIGH!

[Chorus]
To the East, West, North and South
Keep 'em, keep 'em, keep 'em comin' around
To the kottonmouth nation! Pass it Around, Pass it Around

I'm puffin' budz
You know I'm all about it
I got the reggae rock smokin' out my own chalice
My eyes is red; D-Loc can never get enough
Sometimes I sit and think of how much weed i really puff-
You know it's good! I'm sittin' back zonin' out
I'm blowin' dank chronic smell comin' out my mouth
Now show me somethin' I haven't seen before:
It's like givin' candy to a kid up in a candy store!
My eyes is red, the color of a coke can
Boarders got me trippin' wishin' thinkin' i'm in Disneyland
The purple haze
The OG Kush Bud
Trainwreck, CC, Skunk 1 n' Dump Truck!
The cottonmouth got my toungue ridin' it so let me take another hit and let me blow another cloud now
The cottonmouth got my toungue ridin' so let me roll anouther blunt, fill it up, and pass it all around

[Chorus]

pass around the good vibe
And the killer herb
We unitin' the tribe so go and spread the word
It's goin' down man, and I can feel it comin'
We goin' smoke chain, so let me tell you somethin'-
There are some laws spiritual and natural
And nature never lies: that's pure and factual
The propaganda man, it's in the Devil's hands
Watch 'em demonize God's perfect plant!
We been brainwashed all year to believe
That the cannabis plant is some kinda evil seed
Are you kiddin' me? that's insanity!
It's the plant that can unify humanity!
So MISTER OFFICER, STOP HARRASSING ME
And puttin' all my brothas in the penitentiary:
I wanna live in peace, you wanna fight wars
I wanna sing my song
You're beatin' down my door

[Chorus]

You can always catch me next in the rotation (pass it around)
Johnny Richter and let's do some blazin'
I'm so lifted off that chronic,hash bat
Big fatties afre my favorite rolled up in clear wraps, now
Break out your smelly proofs and get ready to do work
We gonna smoke and smoke and smoke until our lungs hurt
Ask if i'm high and my answer's always "YES SIR!"
Cannibis cup '06 was a big blur
But so were '99 and 2000, hotbox the bullshit we hotbox our houses'
Hotbox the car and we hotbox the plane
We got weed plenty so we be A-OKay!
The story's told as the story goes
State to state in a haze blazin' every show
Even over seas we be burnin' em down
As for the K-M-Kings we keep on passin' around

[Chorus]</pre>
