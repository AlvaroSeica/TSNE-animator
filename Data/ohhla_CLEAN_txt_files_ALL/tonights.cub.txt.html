Tonight's the night, all eyes on me
tonight's the night, don't sleep
cock back and pop that thing homie

[Cuban Link]
I'm ghetto bound, so I get around, never put my metal down
I got a score to settle, hot as a tea kettle now-
I'm set up to let off rounds, boil it up or settle down
pedal to metal, bout to turn it up a level now
better tell them clowns, sound the alarm
the pound's in the palm, the bronx already crown me the don
its been a long time comin, now finally it's on
I might have these bitch niggas strippin down to they thongs
how I'm been gone for a minute, so they thought I was finished
with the scars I caught, its added more to the image
how I'm flossin and grinnin in a porshe full of women
feelin on my linen, chillin while chromy rims spinnin-
I'm the unforgiven, I been in and out of the game
through all the heartache and pain, still a target remains
they tried to- rob me for fame, cuz I'm hard in the brain
so I started a chain reaction regarding my name

[Chorus]
tonight's the night, tonight's the night its all eyes on me
tonight's the night, tongiht's the night it's goin down, don't sleep
tonight's the night, so light the spice, crack the Hennessy
I'm out for the night, who gonna bang with me
tonight we ride on our enemies
cock back and pop that thing homie

[Cuban Link]
now I hear them niggas talking that talk, but they ain't true to try shit
they aint walking that walk, all they do is ride dick
don't get caught, give it thought, who you choose to side with
cuz when them guns go off, they shootin supersize clips
new york, new york, true to mine, I keep a live click
and we all trying to see a prophet like god's kid
keep the logic, the topic's to try to die rich
live life at a high risk, driving in fly whips
just five in the closet, spendin night's at the Ritz
no more life in the pits, paradise-this is it
no more ice on the wrist, then alaska chips is what we after- 
shits, gonna last us for chapters
now that's whats up, first get the money and the power
then we flash them bucks, hittin them honeys in the shower
nigga pass the stuff, aint nothing funny about my powder
one hit off the sour flower- you gonna love me in an hour baby

[Chorus]

[Cuban Link]
I'ma roll how I roll, keep my ear to the streets
they don't know what i know, they can't see what I see
I don't go with the flows, I been destined to lead
at the end of the road, i'ma be who I be
give me love, give me hate, give me life, give me death
gotta trust, if it's faith, then oh God do my steps
got the thugs, got the snakes that'll strike from the left
only thugs could relate i'ma ride till my last breath   

[Outro]
tonight's the night, tonight's the night its all eyes on me
tonight's the night, tonight's the night it's going down, don't sleep
tonight's the night, so light the spice, crack the Hennessy
I'm out for the night, who gonna bang with me
tonight we ride on our enemies
cock back and pop that thing homie (2x)
tonight's the night
cock back and pop that thing homie (2x)
