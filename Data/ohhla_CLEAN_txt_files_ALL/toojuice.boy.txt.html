Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
If you looking for me dogg, I'm on the block
Too juiced up
If you looking for me bitch, I'm on the block
Too juiced up

Juice mixtape!
All my niggas got juice
I got all the juice

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
If you looking for me dogg, I'm on the block
Too juiced up
If you looking for me bitch, I'm on the block
Too juiced up
If you looking for me ho, I'm in the club
Too juiced up
If you looking for me dogg, I'm in the mall
Too juiced up

[Verse: Soulja Boy]
I'm in the club, juice the whore
I'm on the block, 2-door 4
I give a fuck about your bitch
I send my goons, kick your door
Real street, real life
And we can sip that dirty Sprite
We can shoot em with the AK or
We can stab em with the knife
I gives a fuck, she can go
Blow for blow and toe for toe
I'm in your hood, come to my hood
There's no limit, ho
I gives a fuck, go on
Come to my motherfucking zone
I got me another mil on my motherfucking phone</pre>
