[Talking]
Hey, What-Nots, what's happenin?
The Moments, what it is, brother?
Hey let's talk about what we know how to talk about best
And what is that?
Girls
Right on!
[Singing] Girls, I like 'em fat, I like 'em small
Some skinny, some tall, I got to get to know them all

[Beat Change]

[Chorus]
I know this is true
Big girls need love too
I'm not lyin when I'm talking to you
Skinny girls need somebody to call 'em boo (*2X*)

You got a body that it takes a horny man to appreciate
I'm not the type of guy to trip about your weight
Uh uh, you my plus size princess
It must of took three people to get you in that dress
When I seen your big booty I flip my wig
But everything else about you is just as big
You're built like Jabba the Hut with two butts
One in the back, one in the front
Got my mind on my money and my money on your food
Cause if I don't take you out to eat you'll catch an attitude
I'm no Denzel when it comes to pull
I know you're only with me because I keep you full
I used to come over with condoms to smash in you
But now I bring a snack for you
Twinkies always seem to get your ass in the mood
And when you're done grubbin, we go back to your room
You're so freaky when it's time to get it on
Sometimes we put ketchup on the bed before we bone
If you haven't had a big girl, let me describe it
It's like havin sex with a wider bed
But who needs a bed when you're there to lay on
Who needs a pillow when I got your big arm
I love gettin lost inside your big body
I'll let you anything, except ride me

She's double my body weight, double my fun
I'm doubling my pleasure like double mint gum
Double my body weight, double the fun
I'm doubling my pleasure like double mint gum

[Chorus]

You got a body that it takes a horny man to appreciate
I'm not the type of guy to trip about your weight
Uh uh, I know why you been skipping dinner
Them white boys been telling you you need to be thinner
I used to get uncomfortable whenever we ate
Cause you would just sit there and stare at the plate
But I been saving hella money since I know what's up
No more dinner dates cause you'll just throw it up
But I still got love for you
Even though I don't know what to do
Everywhere we go people give grub to you
Cause you look like a hungry P.O.W
Sometimes I just feel like leaving
I wanna break up with you but you won't give me a reason
We been together three years, I've never seen you eatin
You're so skinny I can see your heart beatin

You're half the calories and half the fat
But Blueprint still loves you even though your chest is flat
You're half the calories and half the fat
But Blueprint still loves you even though your chest is flat, girl

[Chorus]

Ayo, fat girl
Come here, are you ticklish?
Ayo fat girl
Yeah, I called you fat
Ayo fat girl
Ayo fat girl
Ayo fat girl
Look at me, I'm skinny ---&gt; (Digital Underground, The Humpty Dance)</pre>
