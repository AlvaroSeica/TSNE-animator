[Chorus: Opio] + (Pigeon John)
They say life can be unfair, mm-hmm (whoa-oh)
But I know it's love out there (I know it's love out there)
I'm not blind I see despair (time and time again)
So I gotta sing my prayer
(We gon' sing, we gon' fly, in due time we all gon' shine)
(I've got yours, you've got mine, it's all love when we combine)
(We gon' sing, we gon' fly, in due time we all gon' shine)
(I've got yours, you've got mine, it's all love you know the time)
(We gon' sing..)

[Opio]
My nigga Pep Nitty put game in my ear
Said he welcome the angel of death with no fear
But he still got love on his heel and God's will
So until life reveal it's secrets he gon' build and rebuild
While I write my architectural digests
I keep in mind time is just an illusion
Evolution, I'm only human, but soon in touch
With the outer reaches, to each his own
You might find that when you peep this song
Or walkin down the ave when the heat is on
You might find at the end of your rope with no hope
And can't settle for lyin to yourself no more, nope
I welcome any challenge that fall from the mountains
And don't make excuses when I'm caught off balance (nah)
I take it as a blessing that a lesson was learned
Another weapon in my arsenal to threaten the world
Cause while the earth keep spinnin and maintain polarity
Both sides of the coin destroy you as a casualty (actually)
Or take you on a ride to heights never imagined
in your wildest, childish, self-indulgence get you pulverized
I'm starin at the sun while you close your eyes
A new situation, one more disguise, but I'm fortified
like Organized - "Crush, kill, destroy, STRESS"
Ignore the lies and soar through the skies while you mortified

[Chorus]

[Pigeon John]
People stay a-round like a ring
I foreseen when I was a teen I'd rise like steeeeeeam
No matter what life brings
I'm on the brink of somethin big, I devise my dreeeeeam
And joy come with the sting
The smile and the frown, the ying and the yang it seeeeeeem
that life and death are the same
And what remains is love and it's standing alone beaaaaming
Miguel, batter up, strikeout
Or hit a home run and the fans all SHOOOOOOOOOUT
You know what I'm talkin about
Failure or success and major clout is a myth
And got my niggaz chasin a wish
Gettin dead on a Cadillac just to get a win
But the good life, like they got good hair
And all we do is hate ours, complain and stare and sit
In the same deck apartment
And waste away another day in the compartment
But they free, and don't know they have what they need
I see planet in the granite indeed will be a treat
(and that's right y'all, yeah)

[Chorus]

[Pigeon John]
We gon' sing, we gon' fly, in due time we all gon' shine
I've got yours, you've got mine, it's all love when we combine
We gon' sing, we gon' fly, in due time we all gon' shine
I've got yours, you've got mine, it's all love you know the time
We gon' sing..</pre>
