yo i met this queen yo i met this queen named annalillia

annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
i bet you think i'm silly huh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
i bet you think i'm silly huh annalillia

now i was in a bar when i met annalillia
drunk and high drinkin' shots of tequillia
chasin' it w/genuine draft
tellin' wack jokes as the bartender laughed
i was about one drink away from my limit
in came a black dress w/a black body in it
she looked so timid
it took me a minute 
to get her in focus
he said what'll it be
and just so she could notice Acey i said yo this one's on me
and she stormed
i don't even know who you are fool
keepin' that barstool warm like Norm
then it hit me
right there center in my heartbeat
shot down but i loved it
i was talkin' out the bottom of a shot glass anyways
i says i insist that i pays
by the ways
what your mama name you what they call you
can i call you and soon claim you
i was diggin' a hole i knew i'd fall through
but i aimed to just understand her
a woman that not many men knows
she looked me in my windows and said annalillia
annalillia?

annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
i mean well really uh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
you wanna smoke this philly huh annalillia

now once i broke the ice on the lake the water felt cold
but nevertheless it was water
my conversation caught her
some daddy's daughter and my mama's son
said i'm Acey de uno and i do know how to have fun
i comes from the hills
1 in a mil
2 out of 3 ain't bad 
4 a 5 dollar bill
and a half a dozen thrills
just see how it feels
7 8 9
now he pre-10's (pretends) he's real
and she thought that was so funny
and she put her drink away went to pay w/her money and squirted
all because a brother just flirted 
and didn't know how to word it
i blurted out the door but she never heard it
then annalillia deserted

annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
i bet you think i'm silly huh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
i mean well really uh annalillia

now i was in my car when i seen annalillia again
hmm w/her friend
yo haven't we met before
of course we have
we crossed paths at a local pub
and i was like a lickle drunk on everything i love
i didn't mean to run you off but i did
i must have put too much on it to make you pop your lid
but you did
but what you did for me physically and mentally
got my chemistry just like goin' you just not knowin'
well anyway ok let's try this again
we might as well be friends and do what friends do
foxy lady brown sugar mama karma queen you
don't think i'm a fiend
just give me your number and i'll give you a ring
tingalingaling
she said first of all i got a boyfriend
and a girlfriend
and a couple of rugrats and a cat
splat
ooh she threw me all out of my game
she was open like a (...?...)
so i asked myself the what and the why
so i said self what are you doin'
why are you canoeing when you could have a motorboat instead
then i told her hold her head peace
this ain't what i wanted
but right before i shook the spot i said let me tell you somethin'
annalillia i'm proud to announce
that all balls don't bounce
and that's all that counts
i'm out

annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
annalillia oh annalillia
i mean well really uh annalillia
