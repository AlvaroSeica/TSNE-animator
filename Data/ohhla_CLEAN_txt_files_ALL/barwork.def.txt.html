[Chorus]
Barwork... West up...
Lift up (Pull up, dip)
Barwork (Watch the star work 'til it's it)
West up (Forever my shit)
Barwork (Watch the star work 'til it's it)

[Defari]
I made a sound and an idea
A profitable business, year after year
Undeniably I care, around the clock on the block
In the street they gotta hear
The legendary Likwit Herut
In the blue and grey Air's and the Evisu
My pro club status is crispy too
Blow kush in the air, Johnny Walker Blue
You Triple A niggaz just kill me dude
Stay bitin' every thing that the West Coast do
But I done seen it for years, thick and through
Don't matter, feed yours kids whatever you do
And let's all get this money like Howard Hughes
Tight grip on life, damn right, don't lose
Advertise Mr. Herut on Pay-Per-View
Understand what this black man gave to you

[Chorus - 2X]
Lift up (Pull up, dip)
Barwork (Watch the star work 'til it's it)
West up (Forever my shit)
Barwork (Watch the star work 'til it's it)

[Defari]
Master of deception that's not my thing
Barwork allows me to cut my frame
1/24 Sandra birthed Duane
She gave to the world a chance to change the game
I roll with the Coast that the gangstas claim
High speed blowin' weed in the diamond lane
And respect to your cheese and your hustle mayne
Remember knowledge is degrees on a higher plane
Miraculous, vernacular, the West is Won
But all the shit I been through, I'm just havin' fun
The cowbody partied off Bacardi Gold
Got his swipe wet at 14 years old
L.A. inner town's where I get down
The Baby Jesus stays lined up, call it my crown
I'm like "Look nigga, which type of hook are you?"
No, you and Herut ain't got no plans for movement!
I pull up to my chest, not my neck
You half-ass rap dudes can feel the disrespect
Defari, that's the D to the E
Hey, Johnson used to teach at the I-N-G, chuuch

[Chorus - 2X]
Lift up (Pull up, dip)
Barwork (Watch the star work 'til it's it)
West up (Forever my shit)
Barwork (Watch the star work 'til it's it)
