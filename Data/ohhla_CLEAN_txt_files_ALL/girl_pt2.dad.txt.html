[Ginuwine] Ooooh oooooo oooooh!!!
[P. Diddy] Yeah, this that bounce right here
[Ginuwine] Come On Now!!!
[P. Diddy] Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now straight to the top now

[Ginuwine &amp; Mario Winans]
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 1: P. Diddy]
Girl you made me believe again
If you happy then be with him, go 'head mami breathe again
Go 'head mami breathe again, don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head mami make it hot now
I need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I've been through
And how I had a trifilin mental
So ride with me, G4 fly with me
Times get hard cry with me, die with me
White beach sands lie with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
So tight, now I understand life

[Chorus: Ginuwine, Mario Winans &amp; P. Diddy]
What I need
(P. Diddy: Yeah take that)
Is a pretty woman next to me
(Ginuwine: A pretty woman yeah baby)
To share the dreams that I Believe
(P. Diddy: Dream with me, believe in me)
Maybe we could start a family
(Ginuwine: Start a family baby)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 2: Loon]
This how we lay now what should I say now? Come on ma
Been a whole day now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime youse a crook to me
Cause mami I've done been around the world, seen a lot of places
Been around your girl believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me prevail
But I, learned my lesson watchin Sean stressin
So why listen to her and start guessin?
Mami you ain't ready to ride to start dressin
I need a girl receive my mom's blessin
Confession, my love no contestin
I need affection

[P. Diddy] Yes I need affection, let's go Mario!

[Mario Winans]
Girl what the hell is on your mind
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's somethin leakin in your mind
Don't look too good for you and me, always gettin weak
That ain't what I need, baby!!!

[Ginuwine &amp; Mario Winans]
What I need, is a pretty woman next to me
(Mario Winans: Oh please baby)
To share the dreams that I Believe
(Mario Winans: I need a girl in my life)
Maybe we could start a family
(Ginuwine: Start a family baby)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
Aiyyo the sun don't shine forever
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that a last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put, stress to rest girl stop the games
Name the spot, mami I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the range
Ma I got some thangs, known to put rocks in rings
Push a hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint Tropez?
Or seen a brother play a mandolay?
Girl I wanna just, look in your eyes and watch the sunrise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin, you I believe in
Love you till the day I stop breathin, I love you girl

[Chorus: Ginuwine &amp; Mario Winans]
What I need, is a pretty woman next to me
(Ginuwine: Standin next to me girl)
To share the dreams that I Believe
(Ginuwine: When I wake up in the morning)
Maybe we could start a family
(Ginuwine: I wanna see your pretty face, yeah)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need
(Tammy Ruggieri: Is that all you want?)
Is a pretty woman next to me
(Tammy Ruggieri: Made the sacrifice)
To share the dreams that I believe
(Tammy Ruggieri: And maybe maybe we)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need
(Mario Winans: This is what I need baby)
Is a pretty woman next to me
(Mario Winans: Standin next to me girl)
To share the dreams that I Believe
(Mario Winans: When I wake up in the morning)
Maybe we could start a family
(Mario Winans: I wanna see your pretty face baby)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need</pre>
