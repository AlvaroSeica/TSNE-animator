[Intro: ShoGun Assason, (Islord)]
Let that beat go, what, what
Chant the fuckin anthem, we got the Remedy
For all you motherfuckerin ails
(What, what, what, what) Word up, chant the anthem
Chant the anthem, chant the anthem, chant the anthem
We got the Remedy for all your fuckin ails
(Yo, what, what, what, what) Chant the fuckin anthem
(We got the Remedy with the sword
For all your fuckin ails, yo, yo {Killarmy}
Razor Sharp, yo, yo)

[Remedy]
The laws of physics keep us ground to the solar
The soul controller, secondary to the power of polar
Magnetic tendencies with mobile independancies
Essentially balls in energy, mankind yearns for Remedy
Rival countries declare war for control of the land
Money and power, man, proceeds to kill man
By the hour, daily mixtures, predictions by biblical scriptures
Yo life's a nonfiction, that's your picture that hits ya
Vision quest, the true test of fruits, the nature's temptations
Where man meets the devil and the greed of the nation
There's no excuse for the iducin, of Lucifer seducin' ya
Abuse of the mental's defusin ya, confusin ya
Inconclusiveness, thought can't be taught with no nucleus
There's truth in this, truth master, self-exclusiveness
For glory, the blood of a million spilled, a long stories
It suits ya, Remedy forever givin knowledge for the future

[Beretta 9]
There's no devil without the God, no time's without the hard
No struggle without the strive, we all fight to stay alive
In this wilderness, who missin off, my nigga's soul leak with the safety off
I observed through the corner of my eye, pull the five, most is blind
Falling victim to the time, there's no shit without the crime
My silent weapon is my mind, soldiers come forth and shine
Together as one mind, united we stand, so let us all combine
Together as one mind, for once scrape the nine
Then culturally refine, make notes to waste no time, niggaz

[Chorus: ShoGun Assason]
Chant my anthem, chant the anthem, chant my anthem
We got the Remedy, we got the Remedy for all your fuckin ails
Chant the anthem, chant the anthem, chant the anthem
We got the Remedy, we got the Remedy for all your fuckin ails
Chant the anthem, chant the anthem

[Solomon Childs]
Mr. Miraculous, super spectaculous
With more gun blade then Bronx Tale, so you can call the kid Sonny
You little nigga, mad, cause you gettin' slow money
Brace yourself, as be Wisdom Allah Rule
Megas chew through, gorillas on the move
Reflect when I react, fifty caliber, kept slumped on
I'm takin' it all, from your team and your bottom fronts
It's music for niggas who drive drunk...
You a duck, standing in front of your cell
Holdin' your C.R.E.A.M. cuff, what will you lose?
Cash, and you ain't even gettin' high
Runnin' to the bubble and the pressure applies
Sing' ain't lie, glitter like showcase emeralds
All generals are soldiers, but all soldiers ain't generals
Stand close enough to smell the espionage, God
With shells that solve like Capri's on homicide cases
I could see it in your eyes, you all up in the wrong places

[Chorus]

[ShoGun Assason]
Yo, yo, I sling war slang like cocaine
Verbal dope that numbs your brain, like a shot of Novocain
In your death you will feel no pain
I should teach you with my sword, and the tip was poisonous
Snakes speak lies and their words is venomous, Wu hits come continuos
So I don't give a fuck about '97, ain't feelin this
See what I'm revealin is the truth, and actual facts be the proof
The youth be the fruits, and the elders be the roots
I stand solid, on the firmament, this black man be the dominant intelligence
These be the word's from my testament

[Remedy]
Yo, yo, against the odds, devil with the gods
Fertilize the eggs, spread and plant new pods
The savior, three sixty degrees from the alpha to omega
Walks with the blue light saber, Remedy know the enemy
Ancient mathematics from the mentally headstrong
Physically and mentally, mind in meditation
Constant elevation, resistin temptation
Hidden master plans of world domination

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
