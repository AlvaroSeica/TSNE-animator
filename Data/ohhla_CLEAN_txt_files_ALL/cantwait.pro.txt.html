Album:  Giant Single: The Profile Records Rap Anthology
Song:   I Can't Wait (To Rock the Mike)
Typed by: jostmatt at bluewin dot ch

To let everybody know what I got in store
It's Spyder-D in the place with the rhymes galore
To make the fly girls scream and the whole crowd break
To the bass in the place I can't wait
Cause when I'm on the mike the sucker MC's tremble
Like Jack be quick on the mike I'm nimble
So go tell your mother, your doctor or your lawyer
There's an MC in the world who's a cold destroyer
He spells his name S-p-y and d
e-r dash, then you add another D
And if you break it all down there'll be no debatin
The jam has begun, wallflowers start flakin
And with these words I do command
My smooth rap voice says it's time to dance
There's no need to procrastinate
I got more to say and I just can't wait
Huh
To rock the mike

(Fresh)

I just can't wait
To rock the mike

(Drop that funky)
(Drop that)
(Drop that funky bass)

I said 1-2
1-2-3
Hit it

When I await on a party day
The time just moves so slow
Cause I can't wait till night time come
So I can start my show
Rrrha

When I get to the jam the house is packed
The crowd will say, 'Spyder, we're glad you're back'
I say, 'Yes I'm back, so let's all get right
MC's in the place, surrender the mic'
Then they roll out a carpet that leads to the stage
I am AJ-ed down, burgundy and beige
Nikes on my feet, cold bass in effect
Cut to make everybody break in a sweat
So with these words, heed my command
My smooth rap voice says it's time to dance
No need to procrastinate
I got more to say and I just can't wait
Huh
To rock the mike
Till the broad daylight
To rock the mike
(Fresh)
I can't wait

(Cause when the Spyder's on the beat)
(Cause when the Spyder's on the beat)
(When the record goes round and the DJ backspins)
(DJ Doc)
(Just start that funky rhythm again)

(Rock)
(Rap)

Now this tempo is slow and it's time to go
Cause Spyder-D is doin his show
And when I'm on the mic, you see I don't bite
Recite what other sucker MC's write
Don't imitate the D, all ya duck MC's
Cause compared to the Spyder you're a bunch of fleas
I can't wait to rock the mike
Hah, to the broad daylight

She can't wait to cash that check but I got to rock the mike
He can't wait to meet that girl but I got to rock the mike
You know they can't wait to graduate but I got to rock the mike
I can't wait to rock the mike, you know I just can't wait
