Blade:
Will I be rated as one of the greatest rappers on the planet?
I doubt it
Will Mark be rated as one of the greatest producers?
I doubt it
It's not cuz we ain't good
It's cuz we're from London
That means we're stigmatised
We can't be original
To hell with that prehistoric thinking
Just because your ship's sinking
It doesn't necessarily mean that ours is
I'm known for wearing Carhartt jeans, not Tizer trousers
Your lifestyle is as safe as houses, mine is unorthodox
Oral ecstasy, we never had no videos on the box
Rap's Rambo, one man army
Had it with your mumbo-jumbo
Switchin' roles, now I'm Columbo
Investigatin' the scene
Exposing the perpetrators
How dare you compare yourself to Jesus
Claiming you came to Earth to save us?
Step to the centre stage when you see me yell "May-day"
We ain't here to play, we're here to slay
You better pray
You can bring Robocop, Terminator, Superman, Batman
But none of them can handle this madman

You don't see the signs because you're blind
You're running out of time
I'm using my mind
It's a crime
Stand back and watch a professional rapper rhyme
Put the mic down boy, the show is mine

I don't have time to worship idols, that's for idiots
Triple check the ingredients, strictly no chameleons
On a scale of one to ten you're a zero
Nothing
Learn before you shoot your mouth off
Try to give 'em something
To think about
Work your brain muscles
This has the hustles
Daily from the second the sun rises until it's gone again
The arrival of the full moon means it's time to perform again
The damage is done with one performance and then I'm off again
It something ain't correct we cut it off from the stand
It'll be the same the next month, warn your men
Cordon off your area in your feeble attempts
To try to catch a superior rhymer that's out to bury ya
In the confusion, you're all about to witness
The birth of a showdown
A monumental throwdown
I got the world in the palm of my hand
And as things stand
I intend to steal your fans
&gt;From under your nose
Whether you're friends or foes
I've been watching you
You've been looking dead at your shows
And as it goes
[??] acting as prose
One of these days you'll be exposed (because)

You don't see the signs because you're blind
You're running out of time
I'm using my mind
It's a crime
Stand back and watch a professional rapper rhyme
Put the mic down boy, the show is mine

Let's be realistic, you ain't artistic
You're simplistic
Rippin' off songs that already existed
You go ballistic when we tell you the facts plain
The evidence, you lose control of the emotions
Couldn't hack it cuz you think the world
Should rotate around what you do
But you're sadly mistaken
Here's a rude awakenin'
You ain't gonna win
This whole game's full of amateurs
Fake characters
Human beings acting mechanical
Enter the cannibals
That sucks
The mission is to crush
With the least amount of fuss
Turning leeches into dust
Cuz it's a must
He's a re-programmer
I'm a savage and my weapon's grammar
You're the nail, I'm the hammer
Backstabbers don't survive long when my mic's on
Hypocrites are paralyzed, crushed by the unknown
Destroyer destroying the phonies
Those that act up
Step to the front, we'll bring your back up
