[ CHORUS ]
Yeah and it don't quit
It goes on and on and no, it don't stop
It goes on and on and no, it don't quit
No, it don't stop, no, it don't stop

Loc, grab that mic and get busy

[ Loc ]
I gots the dank and the drink for you stank hoes
Fat chronic sack for the bitches with the dick holes
The drink, it be Tanqueray
To make my niggas go (ho) and the bitches go (hey)
Say fool, what the fuck is up?
You gettin mad cause your bitch gave up them guts?
I had this young tender, toucheth her toes
As I stuck pipe deep in her hole
Swoll', it was nice and warm in that cootie
As I put a grip on that bodacious booty
Ooh, the little miss had it goin on
As I hit the boot to the break of dawn
Out on the lone, wild on the phone
In the fuckin grizzaz, the bitch was passin gas
Bust me a nut, knee deep in the cheeks of her mouth
That's how we do it in the south
And it don't stop

[ CHORUS ]

[ Fesu ]
Step wrong so I can whip your monkey ass with this pistol, fool
And stick dick to your bitch on the cool
Can't be a player, Mister Rich
Hungry-ass nigga, you ain't naythin but a bitch
Loc, tell em bring it on (bring it on, fool)
You can't flip no ki's, mister, livin in the [Name] Homes
Come to the school of hard knocks
Curls played out, mister, grow you some dreadlocks
Show me what you're made of, man
So i can plant your feet knee deep in the promised land
Now you know who's on top
You know your boy Fesu is, nigga, and you know it don't stop

[ CHORUS ]

[ Loc ]
When you see some real niggas, come correct, trick
You need to bow down
Fe, tell them hoes how a nigga clown

[ Fesu ]
Yeah, Greenspoint niggas pack that fat dick
For them hoes and shit, you know who you fuckin with
If your man can't fulfill ya
I'm straight out the Crossbow Motel bitch, I kill ya
Had that pussy cold singin the blues
And have your man sick, wanna be in a kid shoes
Wanna know who's been in it
Tell him Fesu laid that lick down and put that dick in it
And this brother don't get got
Because the shit don't quit, nigga, and you know it don't stop
