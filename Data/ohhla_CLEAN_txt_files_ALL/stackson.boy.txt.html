[Verse 1]
I got money cars clothes ice
Step off in this spot fresh with my hand in mic
Stacks on deck and ya you already know
I can do my dance fast or I can do it in slow mo
I can make it rain on em or I can make it snow
When I go shoppin mane I buy the whole store
Soulja Boy ain't broke I be fresh up on da scene
With monkeys on my toes

[Chorus]
If you know you gettin money
Pull out a 100
Make it rain on dem hataz who be thinkin that cha frontin
Holla stacks on deck stacks on deck
Holla stacks on deck stacks on deck
If you know you gettin money
Pull out a 100
Make it rain on dem hataz who be thinkin that cha frontin
Holla stacks on deck stacks on deck
Holla stacks on deck stacks on deck

[Verse 2]
I got stacks on deck money in da bank
I fresh everything with the coca-cola paint
Coutin up stacks lookin 4 a money clip
I'm a very important person so I'm sittin in da rear
Girls goin strip and fans goin call
On tha ineternet got em jumppin off tha wall
Grill in my mouth so I got a smile on my face
Soulja Boy tellem hit me up on myspace

[Chorus]
If you know you gettin money
Pull out a 100
Make it rain on dem hataz who be thinkin that cha frontin
Holla stacks on deck stacks on deck
Holla stacks on deck stacks on deck
If you know you gettin money
Pull out a 100
Make it rain on dem hataz who be thinkin that cha frontin
Holla stacks on deck stacks on deck
Holla stacks on deck stacks on deck

[Verse 3]
Throw ya money throw ya money throw ya money
If you holdin bout a stack throw ya money throw ya money throw ya money throw ya money
If you holdin bout a stack throw ya money

If you holdin bout a stack make it rain
Make it rain make it rain make it rain make it rain
