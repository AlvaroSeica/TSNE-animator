[Intro]
To the beat y'all.. to the beat y'all
"I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch" - Notorious B.I.G.

[Verse One]
See I done chalked up another one when I drop a ton
Take yo' favorite MC and bring the light like the sun
Get done! Bow down I be the one known to rock rhymes
with lines beyond yours to make it prime time
I'm the master, of the ceremony Mally G
It'll be a long day before you see another me
I be, higher than clouds, with the system pumpin loud
trippin lovin life, it's the illest juvenile
wit my nigga Red, runnin up in
your spot wit enough dick for you and a friend
Some killer ass weed, for those who huff
It make you wanna kill a nigga after takin one puff of the stuff
Shit is tough, but all stress
chased away by the Tanqueray murder in my way
+Heyyy, Young World+, peep my method of madness
Watch it bring sadness because it's that thorough
It's me against the world

[Chorus One: repeat 2X]
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
"I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch"

[Verse Two]
I gets mad wreck when wreck is the concept
Stickin tecs to fake niggaz necks when they flex
For those that don't know about my flows let me introduce
I'm anti truce plus pack a deuce deuce
I'm 5 feet 5 inches, I serve the best of the lyricsts
I come swift, Def Squad soloist
I be one of the illest, realest, gettin busy shorties
Rollin wit Reggie smokin blunts and drinkin 40's
I'm rippin niggaz out the frame with information
when I unleash shit I dust em off like creation
If it's on it's on nigga (say word bond)
Word bond on my momma and his, and his kids!
I represent the Rast where niggaz ill, fuck peace!
All the shit you talkin nigga that will get yo' ass deceased
Murder; haven't you heard of what I be droppin?
Cause when I drop my ill style my style be poppin
like corn, word is bond, it's on again
I wet 'em up till them fess up, with the mac to they chiin
It's the black Mac 10 I never rome with chrome
When I do my ill shit I only represent my home
It's P-H-I double the L, Y
When I'm in New Jersey, North 18th, hittin up Double I
Now sigh in relief cause y'all can't see me
I be the looniest little ass MC, now
when I drop my format I mak yo brains go splat
from what I pack niggaz gots to react

[Chorus Two: repeat 2X]
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
"I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch"
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
"Now I got a glock, makin motherfuckers duck" - B.I.G.

[Verse Three]
Comin from the Squad of Def, never left stranded
All is demanded when the glock nine is handed
Demanded when Green Eye, pack heat
Still keepin it real, maintain to keep it street
Peep, the way I sweep MC's up off they feet
Irritatin like whack rhymes on funk beats
Your shit is obsolete, I speak, and crush when I bust
upon niggaz with the gun like track meets to make em run
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
And when I rock that shot, MC's is sure to fall
You shouldn't have went there, nigga
You gotta come quicker and slicker I'm known to twist a Mr.
Now is you wit me? (With who?) Jamal
Got the girlies hangin from the balls 'til I dick up in they drawers
I got shit covered like plaster, comin massively
Back steps for more wreck and let bitches get passed to me

[Chorus Two]</pre>
