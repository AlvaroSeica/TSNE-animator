[Intro]
RRRR... RRRR {*car engine starts*}
RRRR... {*several gun shots fired*}
Brrr, brrr!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Shout out to my set, shout out to my set (Brick Squad)
Shout out my connect, shout out my connect (Gucci)
Shout out to my check, shout out to my check (Squad)
Shout out my wrist and neck (brrr, brrr)
Shout out my wrist and neck (brr-brr!!)
I'm a man of respect, man of respect (Brick Squad)
And I'm a nigga, with-a, check, nigga, with-a, check
I'm a man of respect, man of respect (Brick Squad)
And I'm a nigga, with-a, check, nigga, with-a, check
Hahhh!

[Wooh Da Kid]
Shout out to your main bitch, shout out to her neck
It's cold outside, I ain't got time to play
So please, don't get wet
It's just me, and my young boy, at your front do' with that Tec
Ain't shit for free, that's it for mre
I demand a check
Shout out to my weed men, I call them the Geek Squad
I smoke too much, I just lost my thoughts
I'm feelin like a retard
Got two bad freaks, plus me, ridin in that two seater
They face to face, I'm by myself
But they huggin like a wifebeater
Shout outs to my O.G., for him I'm puttin in work (brrrap)
Shout out to them real killers
That's puttin in that twerk
Wooh Da king of real niggaz, shout out to my set
Shout out to my jeweler
for my wrist and neck

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Shout out to my accountant, my attorneys and my manager
And shout out them 26's that's sittin up under my Challenger
I'm professional, you're an amateur
You're an artist, I'm an animal
I eat rappers, I'm Hannibal
Not a cannibal, I'm a carnivore
I'm a dinosaur, you're a herbivore
I use verbs and words you ain't heard before
Fake trapper ain't never sold bird before
Probably never even used dirty words before
But not me, cain't stop me
Ain't no hood nigga gon' stop me
I'm focused, just watch me
I send a shout out to my posse (Squad)
I send a shout out to my AR, my Tec-9, and my AK
I don't play, not nowaday, not nowaway, I'm Gucci
Salute me, or shoot me, make yo' next move yo' best move
Every move around me is a chess move
Real goons don't aim for the chest fool
It's Gucci

[Chorus]</pre>
