[Intro: Yelawolf]
Yea, yea, Ye-Ye-Yela
Yea, yea, Ye-Ye-Yela
Yela, Ye-Yela, Yela
Yeah!

[Yelawolf]
We hit the club, tore it up, Mally Mall has got model sluts
+Fearin and Loathin in Las Vegas+, party party, bottles up!
I'm feelin like a king, someone tell me where my robe is
This nitrous oxide got me feelin like Moses
Laugh it up, laughin loud, twist it up until you tappin out
But Yelawolf ain't throwin in the towel, take a pull buddy, how you sound?
My voice feelin like I just swallowed a frog
I think I'm Mr. T, I think I'm Boss Hog
Git-git-git-git-git giddy up, promenade, rip it up, hit the stage
Outta my mind yeah wanna go craze, feelin like I wanna float around for days
She's all about it, she's gettin rowdy
She likes to party, so whip it shawty~!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You got a charge, I got a charge
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard {*3X*}

[Yelawolf]
Baby you, and maybe you, need to come back to the naked room
Whip it whip it, get with it, I'll open you up like a Baby Ruth
She's gettin ripped, she's gettin stripped
Swimmin in a funk, I watch her skinny dip
You wanna feel ill, wanna get real, wanna pop a pill feel out of control
Wanna know what I'm into though, the N-2-ohhh
And cloud nine is, somewhere down below
Get on my level, look at the light show
You lay back in the way back of the Maybach or lay back on the La-Z-Boy
You can pay me back with a BJ in the 'llac, here, enjoy
She's all about it, she's gettin rowdy
She likes to party, so whip it shawty~!

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
Crazy youth, yeah that trashy life
I'm gettin high, I'm in my afterlife
Rock star! No holds barred
Got new hoes sittin in old cars
And I'm feelin like the world is MINE!
Arms wide open, one country at a time!
Middle fingers up, fuck critics
Nitrous in a bottle, bitch whip it!

[Chorus]</pre>
