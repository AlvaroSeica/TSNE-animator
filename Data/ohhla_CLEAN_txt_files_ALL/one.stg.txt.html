(One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one, it's the loneliest number since the number one)

[ VERSE 1 ]
We were tighter than a miser, always kicked it like a Mitre
Wherever she resided you could find me right beside her
I used to play it down as if I only kinda liked her
And my flirty little disses made her eyes shined brighter
I used to think how the hell did I find her?
Watching as she carefully applied her eye liner
Mistified by her
I was suckered until she had me dancing to her tune like the pied piper
I was none the wiser, blindly in love
Oblivious to the fact that in time she'd switch up
And she did, switch, up, proper flipped out
Always on the war path looking for a big row
And I'd oblige, I mean come on, I got a big mouth
Aiming at her high horse tryna knock the thing down
Eventually I got kicked out
But I'd rather go back to sleeping rough than with that bitch now

[ VERSE 2 ]
With the last lass I had things started out casually
The type of girl that I would hang around happily
I became attached to her ever so gradually
Then naturally it turned into a fucking shit factory
What a catastrophe, an absolute mess
A new Mrs with a bag of new stress
Some times I had an attitude, yes
But when im treated l like a mug thats what you have to expect
Jealousy, scrutiny, stressing me, stupidly
Messing with my head till it affected me musically
I can't explain the nightmare that it grew to be
What a huge relief to be away from that lunacy
Usually I'm really not the type of guy to hold a grudge
And I know that falling out of love is part of growing up
But when your lady's acting crazy like she's smoking dust
You're better being on your 1's cause 2 can be as lonely, trust</pre>
