[Intro: Warcloud]
Welcome to Smuggling Booze in the Graveyard
While the little boy had a toy pistol and cotton for a beard
While the little girl cut clothes for her doll out of cloth scrap
And the old woman collected buttons, bows and buckles
Which she kept in bottles
And the old man who has lost something
He looks through his pockets, in his hat
Even under the seats of the people watching the show...

[Warcloud]
..and sidewinders
Unique and authentic, simple but mesmerizing
My oceanic-portioned ideas were dead surprising
Penmanship calligraphy, dash while feds arriving
Colliding, the ghastly arithmetic settles slugs
With a large stiff feather, write epics in devil's blood
Shovels dug three-sixty feet deep, mining for diamonds
Effortlessly shining, outlandish power refinement
Spotlight on top of grandfather clock, erase the decorative
Thirty-fourth consecutive, Palaeolithic perfectionist

[Chorus 2X: Warcloud]
One standard lesson, my weapon concealed in hooks
Add my work to a binder, horror novels and children's books
Paperback or hardcover, rock candy and peppermint
Green or purple grapes while blasting shots through your residence

[Warcloud]
Disciplined apocalypse status, Architectonic
Thoughts monopololistic, ironic, multisymbolic
Sonic verbal illustrations of foreign words and phrases
Literary journals, papyrus, climatic pages
Obviously astonished, neurotic from pleasant tear gas
Syllables of clear glass should of worn engineer mask
Butcher like career last eons, bow with broke knees
Authority of the Jaws, to crush the plants and broke trees
Vivid fluorescent soaked leaves, eloquent neon smoke screens
Deciduous anonymous columnist, how I wrote these
Explanatory notes prescribed, sublime your costume
Or bury you under a lighthouse reading while in the watch room
Vintage typewriter a coffee mug full of fire ants
Incalculatable, acquires amp clocked, before my pliers clamped
Time dismantle the tangle of broken wires
Monumental captain, you dangle in open fires
High truth there's choking liars, wilful and permanent crippling
You die invertebrates and I skilfully exterminate siblings
These elements of style fade out like gleaming horns
Type to misshape in chaos, of well-seeming forms
Being born, purple scorpion creep across sandy land
Hand me grams 'cause I stay off the hook like Candyman

[Chorus 2X]

[Warcloud]
Earwax melts, production of written works
Out the darkness, hidden first, pocket watchers, forbidden dirt
Mention worse 'cause I'm knowledge pictorial directions and signs
Order international soups and extensive selections of wine
Grind ox blood, data town red, transcend desire
And obliterate any town with more nuclear force than required
Out the ashes of war, spring elegance, phantom like
The synchronized slither, organically grant them light
Archetype, architectural mind, renowned thinker
Last eminent composer, theatrics surround speaker
Acoustic, immeasurably deep, white liquid marble
Fiji water, swig and gargle, conspiring to hit your cargo
Metacarpals pop orchestras, violently scribble novels
Choreographically grovel, the phonograph record wobbles
Pistachios and cashews, mastering can be difficult
Move counter centrifugal, flow to nowhere is typical
Aquatic plants, architect starving as green sharks
Granted rare stamp collections and marvellous theme parks
The award winning pen, you fumble hustles and scams
Rusty tugboats, drains, foghorns, muscles and clams
Whistle through your speaker, elections for neighbourhoods at a sequel
Collision course inscription, the end of all that is evil

[Chorus 3X]

[Outro: Warcloud]
Now run along to Hell...</pre>
