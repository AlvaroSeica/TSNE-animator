Typed by: DJ_DFense_AKA_SSin@hotmail.com

Uh uh, uh uh
Where the real niggaz at ?
What, who got my back ?

[Verse 1]
And who will be ready for war at all cause
Position themselves to take the fake heads off
And who will really cock their weapon
knock their mouth when it's time for you and your team to go all out
And who in the face of danger keeps quiet
Never snitch, never give up your mans and them for shit
And who will rock my party like kane ?
Push that shit like rocks to the top of the game
Is it you and who got my back like a K
So and can be a super hero get more money like Deneiro
And who will never sell their soul
Or the asshole for the dollar if you feelin' me niggaz
Then holla and who sees this shit through veteran eyes
And for hip-hop be more than ready to die
Surprised it's not many, real niggaz left my minds
Designed the gat while you step in facts

[Chorus]
And who gonna get my back, oh
And who gonna bust their gat for me
And who gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real like gangstas do, who

[Verse 2]
And who's gonna support their seeds
Be a father to their child
And still live big willy style
And who gonna walk their dogs till their tongues hang out
Till world wide your joints bang out
And who's gonna keep the faith in ya niggaz
Not getting' gassed and caught up with these silly gold diggers
And who will never hate, never be an ingrate
Never wind to cry whether free or upstate
And who on steroid all muscled up
Won't rubbers the wrong way and get their ass fucked up
And who will write their own rhyme
Time after time hot shit that leaves the comp dumb and blind
If it's you than you came to the right place
And if it's not you can smash with a brick in the face

[Chorus]
And who gonna get my back, who
And who gonna bust their gat, who
And who gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real like gangstas do, who

And gonna get my back, Who
And gonna bust their gat, who
And who gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real like gangstas do, who

And who gonna get my back, who
And gonna busts their gat, who
And who gonna feel like I feel, keepin' it real like gangstas do, who

Who got me, who
Who got me</pre>
