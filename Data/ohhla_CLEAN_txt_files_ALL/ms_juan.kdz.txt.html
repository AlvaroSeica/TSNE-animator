Song:   Ms. Juanita

Ms. Juanita Ms. Juanita had a body off the meter
Every time I would see her I would think of Anita apple balm
Hoping she would put me on
Like her favorite song
Halter top 7 gees little trace of Vicky thong
Heard around the hood a lot of niggaz did her wrong
She was young with them thugs knew it wouldn't last long
I was trying to get them Juelz like Cam'Ron
Thinking in my mind I would try to wait to stand strong
Trying to pass the test just like a scantron
Seen her at the club played her hands on
Told her baby girl this my plea
Let me tell you let me tell you, let me tell you what I see
It's me and you up in a tree
k-i-s-s yes yes you know the rest
started feeling on her breast and she licking on my neck
said let me take you back to the crib and undress
we made it back bumpin' best of marvin on my mini-mac
she said wait a minute, sing my song on the track

[Chorus]

Ms. Juanita Ms. Juanita had a body off the meter
Every time that I would meet her she'd be wanting me to treat her
But I didn't have no dough
And I guess you could say that the directa(?) flow
But yo, if I really had it then you know I would spend it
But I couldn't buy shit, man let alone rent it
Every now and then she would call me and let me bend it
She was gone in 60 seconds just as soon as I was finished
I wish I had a minute to tell her how I feel
I woulda wifed her as soon as I got a deal
But I never got the chance
And every time I seen her she was with another man making other plans
And I know I ain't a baller, could be a little taller
But if I made her mine guaranteed I would call her
Back in my mind I thought we would connect
Cause I knew we had way more then good ass sex

[Chorus]

Ms. Juanita Ms. Juanita got a body off the meter
Girl I want you in my world
Can't give you diamonds or pearls
But I can make your toes curl
I can be your lover
And I can be your friend but it really all depends
If you want to let me in I would learn to make amends
Go fresh from the start want a spot in your heart
Dearly depart glass of wine picnic at the park
Go shopping at the grove getting drinks at the shore
Ball, and I can't valet you with a foreign car
I can treat you like a star
Long as we stay under par
But that will never happen
That'll never come true
I just want to let you to know I still love you</pre>
