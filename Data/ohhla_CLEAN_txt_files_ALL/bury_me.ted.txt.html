Bury me
Bury me
Go head and Cemetery me
Bury me
Bury me
GO head and Cemetery me

Yeaaaa

Ay gone head and bury me
Tell em cemetery me
Six feet six deep tell em they can carry me
Look inside my coffin you see anger you see malice
See lust on top of lust
A blackened heart thats cold and callous
Dark thoughts, ways, heart, dark forces
And nights darker than a Bruce Wayne endorsement
Snitchin' on my heart
Cardiac arrest
Spirit came and gave my filthy cardiac a rest
I was dead to god
Sin headlong
Wasn't ready to die
Boy I was dead wrong
Now Im dead and gone
Me and my old ways
Even my foreign rights would take me back the wrong way
And no way
I ain goin back
Fill my pillowcase with dirt and let me take a nap
Put my sin to sleep
Execute my flesh
Tell my worldliness to lay it down and take a rest

(chorus)
The old me is dead
I ain neva comin' back
So gone get my coffin and suit up in all black
I promise you can bury
Ay go ahead and bury me
You wanna you can bury me
I'm dead and gone so bury me

The old me is dead
I ain neva comin' back
So gone get my coffin and suit up in all black
I promise you can bury
Ay go ahead and bury me
You wanna you can bury me
I'm dead and gone so bury me

(Tedashii)
Okay you can bury me
Gone head and bury me
Sinner from beginner so my wages cemetery me
Try to do good
gave my all just like a charity
But good works like a casket
They just box me in and bury me
Found life in the word
Minus Webster's dictionary
Now I tell the story of my life in death obituary
Life ain over but its already gone
Yeah ya boy crossed over but I'm already home
Ay somebody call my mama
Go get her on the phone
Tell me Jesus rose up and showed up
Hold up her baby gone
See everybody pass
Life on this earth won't last
These cats will take your lights and turn em off
Teddy Pendergrass
I know who keep 'em breathin
Know him cause I believe him
He bled for sin and died for men who daily choose to leave him
They deserve death and I was one of them baby
But he saved me and he raised me so please believe me I die daily

(chorus)
The old me is dead
I ain neva comin' back
So gone get my coffin and suit up in all black
I promise you can bury
Ay go ahead and bury me
You wanna you can bury me
I'm dead and gone so bury me

The old me is dead
I ain neva comin' back
So gone get my coffin and suit up in all black
I promise you can bury
Ay go ahead and bury me
You wanna you can bury me
I'm dead and gone so bury me

(Lecrae)
I'm a loser
You a go-getter
I lost that girl homie you can go get her
I don't recommend that
Un unh I did that
Gave her my all lemme tell you what she gives back What?
Death! I promise I'm so dead already
He changed my batteries and now ya boy forever ready
I'm ever ready
When he get back
Look death in the face 
Told 'im sit back

(Tedashii)
Now gone and sit back
This life forever fleetin'
I know you don believe me
Its deceivin we still breathin
To perceive it can take a life
Like playin with metal toys
Never make sense like your mind playin tricks
Ghetto boys
Unless you seek the lord
And his divine plan
Then you just watchin' time pass
Trying to rewind sand
The hourglass tickin
I'm okay I'm in position
Dead to me alive in Christ
Bury me
Watch me livin'

(chorus)
The old me is dead
I ain neva comin' back
So gone get my coffin and suit up in all black
I promise you can bury
Ay go ahead and bury me
You wanna you can bury me
I'm dead and gone so bury me

The old me is dead
I ain neva comin' back
So gone get my coffin and suit up in all black
I promise you can bury
Ay go ahead and bury me
You wanna you can bury me
I'm dead and gone so bury me</pre>
