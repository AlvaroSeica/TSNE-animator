[Chorus: Kobe] + (Bun B)
Cause them boys keep challenging me
So I'm gon' make sure I could drop 'em (drop 'em)
Load 'em up and cock 'em (cock 'em)
Arms out the window and aim! (I will pull it back)
Aim! (I will let it go) Aim! (I will lay you down)
Cause them boys keep challenging me (but there's no competition)
So I'm gon' make sure I could drop 'em (drop 'em)
Load 'em up and cock 'em (cock 'em)
Arms out the window and aim! Aim! Aim!
Cause them boys keep challenging me (but there's no competition)

[Bun B]
Cause I am Mike Jordan, Mike Tyson, Mike Phelps
Michelangelo with the flow bro, and the mic helps (helps)
I keep the mic stealth (stealth) that's for the mic's health (health)
You take me out, now that's some funny shit, Mike Epps (Epps)
They say the streets need a hit, it ain't gon' write itself
So I'ma set this bitch on fire, it ain't gon' light itself (self)
Then I'ma beat the beat up, it ain't gon' fight itself
Fuckin left and right itself until it good night itself (self)
That's for the O.G. to do it
Just between me and you, you know what we'll do, fool

[Chorus: Kobe] + (Bun B)
(I will pull it back)
Aim! (I will let it go) Aim! (I will lay you down)
Cause them boys keep challenging me (but there's no competition)
So I'm gon' make sure I could drop 'em (drop 'em)
Load 'em up and cock 'em (cock 'em)
Arms out the window and aim! Aim! Aim!
Cause them boys keep challenging me (but there's no competition)

[Bun B]
Cause I am Al Capone, John Gotti, Larry Hoover
Tooky Williams, Mike Concepcion (on) bitch I will do ya (do ya)
Now when you talkin do a million people listen to ya? (to ya)
Or do they slip and keep it movin like they never knew ya? (knew ya)
You born a sucker, die a sucker, yeah you get the picture
When you go, you gon' try to take some trill niggaz wit'cha (wit'cha)
Son of a bitch ya, I say fuck you forget ya (get ya)
Come in to get ya in a bodybag that shoulda fit ya (fit ya)
Nigga, talkin down in your subliminal rap (rap)
Well playa you gets no dice (dice) like digital craps (craps)
Snap back to reality, don't be another studio, casualty
Try to battle me, I leave 'em rattled G (G)
That's for the O.G. to do it
Just between me and you, you know what we'll do, fool

[Chorus: Kobe] + (Bun B)
(I will pull it back)
Aim! (I will let it go) Aim! (I will lay you down)
Cause them boys keep challenging me (but there's no competition)
So I'm gon' make sure I could drop 'em (drop 'em)
Load 'em up and cock 'em (cock 'em)
Arms out the window and aim! Aim! Aim!
Cause them boys keep challenging me (but there's no competition)

[Raekwon]
Use ya staircases and aces, razor blade cameras and scrapers
We do it big, I got the rig with the big guages
Travel mad places in front, we just stunt, you know my shakers
All of them shoot just like the Lakers
Paper fryers and Goliaths, Michelin tires, he wired
Kill that nigga with the quick fast and tie it
Check that Houston goose and the cranberry will loosen niggaz up
Quick, thought he was straight, just like some mousse and
Stat and Pharaoh bustin them bow and arrows, we cussin, we glowin sparrows
Chums is long and doofy like cousin Carol
Two for fives, dope fiends get crucified, both teams is super live
Me and Buns, the underworld is ours nigga
Pantries is filled with nothin but blow, and scampy shrimps
Try to stop me niggaz shoot through his eyes
Globetrotter, coke coppin the stove, he drove coppers
(Cause them boys keep challenging me) Cause there's no competition

[Chorus: Kobe] + (Bun B)
So I'm gon' make sure I could drop 'em (drop 'em)
Load 'em up and cock 'em (cock 'em)
Arms out the window and aim! (I will pull it back)
Aim! (I will let it go) Aim! (I will lay you down)
Cause them boys keep challenging me (but there's no competition)
So I'm gon' make sure I could drop 'em (drop 'em)
Load 'em up and cock 'em (cock 'em)
Arms out the window and aim! (I will pull it back)
Aim! (I will let it go) Aim! (I will lay you down)
Cause them boys keep challenging me (but there's no competition, competition...)
