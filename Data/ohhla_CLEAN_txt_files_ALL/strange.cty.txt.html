[Man In Charge]
I'm a confirmed maniac when I hit you with the braniac
Crazy raps pickin' up the slack from your lame attack
Truth is back, black ink is the choice weapon
So either get to steppin' or get ready for the Armageddon
I'm lettin' the beat take me where I gotta go
You can stay the same shape but I gotta grow
How you even make it this far I gotta know
Everybody doesn't have a gift shit I got it though
Flow like an ocean, can I get a motion
To stop these wack emcees from promotion
Loadin' the funk with the bass and percussion
It's bound to thump whether edited or cussin'
Give it here or don't say nothin'
And I don't really care who's mic I'm crushin'
Since I hooked up with Jacoby and Justin
From the rich kids to the ones that's strugglin'
They lovin' it!

[Clavius Crates]
Twist a linguistic assisted by vivid rhythmics
Delicious... like licorice sticks, ridiculous statistics
Exhibit why I'm sly and slick and scientific
You couldn't define my rhymin' quickness if you tried applyin' physics
My vibe is mystic, enlist your mind to listen
My metaphysical fitness is in terrific condition
Rappin' apparition, slappin' mathematicians
Who couldn't fathom the distance I travel when I'm spittin'
My man, it's written... in prophecies, stoppin' me
Is impossible to achieve and plots will lead to mockery
MCs be droppin' sloppily, you got to be precise
To reach the height I freak it when I speak in sleep at night
Unique and tight, seein' me, you need a beacon light
My sleek insight will seek the right reasons to keep it hype
I need to fight the evil type and free the mic from fools
So I recite jewels and write rules to fight duels

BREAK (DJ Cataclysmic)

[General P]
Born &amp; raised in a maze where freedom's the next phase
My frame breaks the chains that's tailor-made for slaves
Is it strange? That I don't gang-bang to maintain credibility
For suburban thugs, dog is you kiddin' me?
Admittedly, few can see me lyrically and it'll be
A blizzard in Sicily before I let you limit me
Belittle me, or even timidly commit a penalty
Against me, we turn MC's to mincemeat
Off the pen streaks and beats banged on MP's
My locomotive is rollin' over your ten speeds
I don't get caught up in bickering over men's jeans
Or hatin' on a trapper braggin' on his wrist gleams
So if I gotta wear ya labels simply 'cause I'm tryin' to turn the tables
And rearrange the game's angles
Then so beat it, there ain't no secret I'm exposin' weakness
In your pretense, until the whole globe sees it

[Cheeks]
We reverberating writtens at ravenous rapid speeds
Disastrous masterpiece
and after the master's siege
I'll happily pass the bleeze
Anything else..
Is under-doing, pursuing the ruins of truants
That grew into blooming the city perhaps
Into echelons, achieved by the Megatron
Know as the city of trees, prodigal beast and you a leprechaun
Records get shattered along with world views...
Soon as we step in the place, we repping the Ace
The weapon is pace, with definite taste
For blessing your mates, with effortless grace
You'll leave a better person
Can't conceive a better merchant
For peddling truth
I meddle in booths
until I severe a tooth
Fill in the gaps like Letterman dude
Man I made it I'm living
From the aide of my wisdom
Evaded the prison
and made it a prism
So the hues are right
To confuse the types, that misuse the mic
my dudes are nice!!</pre>
