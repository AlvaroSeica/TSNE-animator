[Finn the Human]
Maybe we can get these dudes to help us
{*muttering, groaning and sighing*}

[Jake the Dog]
These guys won't help you
They're all complacent sheeple
{*Jake starts beatboxing*}

[Finn the Human]
Wait - that's it!
We're gonna freestyle a political rap
To get these guys to rise
out of their systemized demon apathy

[Jake the Dog]
Ohh-kayy... {*beatboxing again*}

[Finn the Human]
Yeah, uhhh, political rap
Yo, yo
Demon apathy, yo zappity
Get ready, government
Where you went?!
Yo - Farmers Market!
Ride bikes, get on it
Geodesic domes
Science - YOU HEARD?!!

{*raucous cheering*}

[Demons]
I never thought of it that way before
  This system is broke, yo!
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!</pre>
