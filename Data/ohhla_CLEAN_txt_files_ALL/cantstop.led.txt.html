[Birdman]
Shinin, grindin on the shine, flippin all the time
When we hustlin, Young Money gunnin
Cash Money flippin, shit them everytime
When we grindin cause we gettin, flippin the change range
and doin different thangs, hittin the same lanes
But flippin didn't change
Yeah; hi-higher then we ever been
More money, now more money cause we ballin in

[Chorus: T-Pain]
You know I can't stop, I won't stop
I feel like everybody's tryin to kill me
So I don't stop, 'til I'm on top
And God keeps tellin me I will be
If you with me then salute, you know what to do
You know what to do, put your hands up in the air
You can make it through
All you gotta do is put your hands up in the air

[Birdman]
Shinin bright lights, hotter then them other lights
The red light flash mash on the same night
More money, now we brighter then we even been
Hundred thousand poppin bottles, bitch we goin in
Crystal lights, blowin on that Cali 'dro
Turkey bag, hundred thou' on the marble floor
Rainbow, red bone with the triple color
Hurricane, make it rain bitch, every summer

[Chorus]

[Birdman]
Yeah it's on deck, straps on deck
Sticks on deck, Stunna Island, private jets
P-put the house on 'ginia nigga we place the bet
From hundred G's to flippin hundred, bitch we hit the lick
High on the hill, the view above the falls
Smashin in the field, a hundred boss hogs
You know how we do it, bossin up brand new
Uptown survivor, money ready shoot

[Chorus]</pre>
