[Intro: S.I.] (Sheek Louch)
Oh yeah! (Yeah! It's the comp!) Na na na na na!!!
(D-Block!!! S.I. Let's go!!!!)

[Chorus: S.I.] (Sheek Louch)
I'm just ridin in my drop top, safety on the glock
Chick with me, rollin up sticky
Ain't nothin I'm just tryin to get my paper, my paper
(Hey we just tryin to get our paper man!)
I'm so fire, fire (Thatr's all!!!) 
Patron got a brotha feelin higher, higher (HEY!!!) higher, higher (I got you my G!!!)
Ain't nothin I'm just tryin to get my paper, my paper (Sheek Louch!!!)

[Verse One: Sheek Louch]
Yeah! Yo! At this chick house playin Uno
Got a daughter in the other room watchin Juno
PS3 and, door locked ma's O.D. and, ass naked
Weed burnin tell her to take it
Yeah, you know me though, Magneto
Metal on me black Dan Devito, penguin
England, governor off, auto bar
Louis Vuitton some shit that Kanye can't find
Catch me, I'm too fly for the God to sketch me
Too bright for the cameras to watch
Too much talent for Koch, Interscope or Def Jam
Here I am, I'm gettin money either way, DAMN!

[Chorus: S.I.] (Sheek Louch)
I'm just ridin in my drop top, safety on the glock
Chick with me, rollin up sticky
Ain't nothin I'm just tryin to get my paper, my paper
I'm so fire, fire 
Patron got a brotha feelin higher, higher (HEY!!!) higher, higher 
Ain't nothin I'm just tryin to get my paper, my paper 

[Verse Two: Styles P]
Stay auz on 'em, droptop aqua blue Porshce on 'em (Haha!)
So money, I'ma catch it like Moss on 'em (I got 'em), or my Tom Brady
(Who?) Is it the fiends or the fans that have gone crazy? (Get it?)
I hustle harder than the immigrants (true)
Nas bought Chanel for his woman friend (okay)
Me I buy Dior with the Benjamins
Sex on the mansion floor, minute then a minerin (you know)
I'm just breezin in my droptop
Honey plan shotty, let the deuce deuce pop pop (Let it go)
Blowin on sticky green and paper never stop, op (Never!)
D-Block, lil' homie, I'ma let the glock pop

[Chorus: S.I.] (Sheek Louch) (*Jadakiss)
I'm just ridin in my drop top, safety on the glock
Chick with me, rollin up sticky
Ain't nothin I'm just trtin to get my paper, my paper
I'm so fire, fire 
Patron got a brotha feelin higher, higher (HEY!!!) higher, higher 
Ain't nothin I'm just trtin to get my paper, my paper 
(*Ain't nothin, HE HEH!!!!!!!!!!)

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Yo, speedin in the left lane (Uh)
'Cause this is just a steppin stone to the next game (uh-huh)
Either that or in the hood with the best 'caine (Yep)
Little league from rotary to exchange
And I still remember when the first checks came (uh)
Roof in the trunk is how the new Lex came (Woo!)
With the air holes, how the new Tecs came (heheh)
Figure that the higher I get, the less pain
YOu dudes is playin checkers but it's a chess game
Soon as I hit my number, I'm on the next train
I can't explain, my weed's puday, diamonds all Blu-Ray
Bad chick wit me and we flyin down the throughway, what!

[Chorus: S.I.] (Sheek Louch)
I'm just ridin in my drop top, safety on the glock
Chick with me, rollin up sticky
Ain't nothin I'm just tryin to get my paper, my paper
I'm so fire, fire 
Patron got a brotha feelin higher, higher (HEY!!!) higher, higher 
Ain't nothin I'm just tryin to get my paper, my paper 
HEY!</pre>
