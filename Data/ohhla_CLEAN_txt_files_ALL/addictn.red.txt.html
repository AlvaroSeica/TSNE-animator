[Chorus] [x2]
We never talk
There was a time when there weren't enough words to say
We never touch
But I remember when you couldn't keep your hands away

[Verse One]
I had you gone of it
Now you won't acknowledge existence?
I knew you from inside and out but now it's from a distance?
I haven't kissed your lips since the day you said you "get sense"
But not in time before I made your mind flip scripts
Into a rhyme misfit
What a dime
You were defined at a time when your mind said unrefined sick shit
So I inclined to visit with my feelings sugar coated
I'm a bitch still but you probably wouldn't have spit well if you noticed
And you fucked me once and took mo' head
Sex on the first
You gave great head like kings on porno's playin' nurse aid
And that's the way my brain thirst may
You all fucked up in the top 
Like the kid on your block displaying the worst fade
So it was on Thursday that I knew you meant the world to me
And you even showed me love though I made you hurl to three
So I was your girl to be
You set money aside for me
Tricked me out to your friends although you was trippin' high degree
Excitedly 
Who am I to leave? But yo you took it there
After I helped you with all the shit between the hooks and snares
Crooked stares is all I'm receivin' with no letters
We pissed, don't forget I made your flow better
And themes of average go getters
But when you see me out with others 
It's pissin' me off cause you don't seem so jealous
I should have known better when we was neighborin'
Why can't you see the only love you need is paper thin?
Bout to get your peeps and rapin' them real melodic
Cause that love you still got on your mind
I still got it
So why you actin' all wild, high and diabolic?
Just remember that Miles Stanish is my by product

[Chorus] [x2]
We never talk
There was a time when there weren't 
enough words to say
We never touch
But I remember when you 
couldn't keep your hands away

[Verse Two] [C-Rayz Walz]
Between orgies and 40s
Shorties on tour
You ripped the plastic 
Pulled up
(And hit me raw)
Seasoned my meat
You had to do that 
(Just to eat)
Crazy smooth 
Blazin' you made your energy weak
Kept you wet with desire, in your chest I was fire
(Hot sex on the highway)
Lucky driver
In the club or the street
If you seek you'll find
Told you I was there, your peeps told you it was all in your mind
I gave you power coward
(Charmin' charisma)
You was nobody bitch, I was the bomb
(Ask your sister)
Came home smellin' like sex
(Your folks was stressin')
What the hell, take the "L"
(Every lesson's a blessing)
Now your paranoid, thinkin' my boys is out to get you
Thought it was a joke, the first time I hit you
And all the time you hit me
(Was I ever abused?)
Gave you what you already had and I felt so used
Chronic fatigue, memory loss
(Your life's a drag)
Roaches in your house, I taught you
(To let that pass)
You analyze everything, no complains
(No doubt
But once you hooked up with him, the truth came out)
I used to take away the pain, now you act all bubbly
Tryin' to go against the grain like you just don't love me
You ugly!
I make you the most around people
(Call Earl/hurl)
Throw it up in his face
(He won't believe you)
In love with a liar
(My truth was absolute)
But like the D-E-A
(You just need more proof)
Still waters run deep, let's test the driftin'
And with half full glass, you still [Chorus] [x2]
We never talk
There was a time when there weren't 
enough words to say
We never touch
But I remember when you 
couldn't keep your hands away[Chorus]

[Verse Three] [Manfred]
How you doin' love?
It's been a long time
I know it's unexpected
Hope I didn't catch you at the wrong time
But you cold hurt me
Cursed me out one night
And after that one fight
Cut me off cold turkey
Come sunlight, your body felt so dirty
I'm gone now, but why you let me go so early?
It's no hurry
I told you, "Take it slow" when we first met
But you made a blizzard out a snow flurry
But no worries, I'm back now
If you ever need me, I'm always here
I ain't to hard to track down
You won that last round but why fight anyway?
Cause I got what it takes to make your mind right everyday
Look, we already way past all these petty games
So why you edgy tryin' to carry all this heavy pain?
Screamin' help and everybody's ignorin' ya
But I can have you in a constant state of euphoria
The more that you try to fight the harder I twist
Your mind and your body tight like a clenched fist
We intimate, like a french kiss we're inseparable
Try to pull away if you want, but I'm not lettin' 

[Chorus] [x2]
We never talk
There was a time when there weren't 
enough words to say
We never touch
But I remember when you 
couldn't keep your hands away
