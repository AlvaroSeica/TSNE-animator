"Tekneek" (echo)

[Chief Kamachi]
Yeah, ain't slept in days, stuck in a craze
Think she under siege, whole world abducted by graves
Sound of Michael Meyer, faith and melody plays
She in Belvi smack the doctor with the medical trays
They say she's sick and need healing for months
Found her naked on the Church step peeling a blunt
Told the Preacher her and Satan had a beautiful runch
And he dig her, even though she kinda knew that her bunch
Then she blacked-out, walking moving traffic instead
Then she wake up, whole body strapped to the bed
Seen the white light, think she suppose to be dead
Sound of the heart machine beat real close to her head
Doctor at the door with a package of her meds
And the police both ankles strapped to the bed
What was in the weed she just smoked with little Hamed
When she get out, she might wind up killing a dread

(Chorus) 4x
She's a prisoner of her own mind
Gon' blind been losing at the whole time

[Chief Kamachi]
Yeah, until the dark coal, the judge applaud me
Shackles and chains rock like the government jewelry
No commissary, solitary
Sewer water, same old steak from ??Salad's berry??
Can't go free, you know how many trials they hurry?
Files they burry, and the rats get the squealing
I'm top Ankh counting all the cracks in the ceiling
The Ye' wanna give me twenty macks for the dealing
He give me five if I give 'em connects
My dad ran an honor, raised by men of respect
Take it on the chin, the lifestyle I chose is a select
When I'm gon', put a gangsta red rose on a rep
All I got is four walls, pacing the cage
A religious rug, pictures of me taking the stage
Is my life worth more then the ink on the page?
When I'm gon' they'd rather see me locked up like a slave

(Chorus) 5x
I'm a prisoner of my own crime
Doing time, didn't listen to the last sign

La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
Prisoners, prisoners
Prisoners, prisoners
