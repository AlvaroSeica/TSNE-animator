Get acquainted to the one and the only
The future, hip-hop king
Forever, the Canibus... (The Funkmaster Flex is coming!)

[Canibus]
Yo, yo
For all you niggaz sayin that my shit is sick, just imagine
the ninety percent of my brain that I ain't even used yet
Take a deep breath, quick, suck in as much air
as my lungs will permit -- then I start to kick that shit
I been gettin busy before the planets started to turn
Before the bees, the birds, and Adam and Eve occured
Prior to all creation, in other words
When the female egg will merge with the man's sperm
I stand firm, my words burn through your exterior
The eat away at your materia, I'm superior
While you only pretend to be, I can double my density
from three-sixty degrees to seven-twenty instantly
Six, multiplied by five by four by three by two
then one, go head and calculate the sum
The time has cometh, I was summoned to punish
Motherfuckers with mouths to run it ? with rubbish
When I come through, niggaz stand stiller than statues
Cause if I have to, I'll battle your whole rap crew
Then I'll attack you with words that's absurd
and rip your fuckin skin off just to get on your nerves
