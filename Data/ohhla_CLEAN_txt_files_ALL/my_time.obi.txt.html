[Intro: Obie Trice]
Got money on my mind, no time for nonsense
I'm gettin mine, 'bout to shine around here
Lights in the bezel, price up a level
Twenties on the feet, catch him in the street

[Obie Trice]
Twenties on the Hemi, nigga made his quota
Nigga still +Shady+, even though we over
That don't stop my dollars from rollin over the mower
I'ma put that product out until my casket below us
Obie never slow up, gettin it sho' 'nuff
I'ma be a problem 'til the world freezes over
Pistol in this holster, shootin like the Pistons
Bitches on his dick cause they know he about his business
Beatin up the block is somethin very expensive
Ice in his watch, haters payin attention
Trice in the cockpit navigatin the engine
Aviators watchin for haters tryin to stick him
Get money 'til the day I'm a victim
'Til I lay beneath the clay all stiff then
But for now I'ma get my rich in
Double that dollar - flippin

[Chorus: Obie Trice]
Got money on my mind, no time for nonsense
I'm gettin mine, 'bout to shine around here
Lights in the bezel, price up a level
Twenties on the feet, catch him in the street
Bet a nigga like me never catch him on the beat
Get that bet twice, I'ma catch him with the heat
Money on my mind, homie on the grind
Been away a minute but it's my time

[Obie Trice]
Jumpin out of cars, in and out of broads
Spendin, we ain't penny addin, we be gettin ours
Show you how to floss, show you buy the bars
Y'all all talk, we notice y'all flaws
Y'all in-laws, we married to the game
Y'all just the mayne, next to the mayne
I been spendin change since the dope game
Then he made a name for himself after cocaine
Call him Kwame Kilpatrick, you could try to catch him
Dope I got access, no text messagin
Trice is an asset
Niggaz in the trap know his past say he know where the cash at
Louie on his toes, dubs on the vehicle
BME, I see it though
I'ma need it my nigga then repeat it though
D-boy in that two-seater, let's go~!

[Chorus]

[Obie Trice]
In and out of jets, him is but a vet
Been around the world, him ain't finished yet
And I don't need London to bloke or be stuntin
I poke out like a bunion in any country I run in
With any culture the code is his ulcer{?}
Thug co-exist in the hood to Nova Scotia
Fists full of dollars, lipstick 
on a nigga's collar courtesy of your missus
You don't wanna miss this, misfit
Mr. Michigan, gettin this, richness, in
I'm a better me, tell me who 'head of he?
I'm somethin like veteran usin letters over melodies
Trice is still in it
Real name, no gimmick, never fold cause of business
(Business) Bitches (bitches)
I'ma get it fo' X over, nigga you be the witness

[Chorus]</pre>
