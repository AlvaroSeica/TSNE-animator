Song:   I'm Gone
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Pour some liquor in my cup, shake it stir it up
Pa pa pass it up, keep it coming 'til I'm stuffed
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

The club kiss 'er down when I park outside
All eyes on me when I walk inside
When they go a nigga will like it's undecided
Behind these notes like I'm tryin' to have my faith
Hate nigga get up out my space
Talk Obama, we gon cut the case
Matter of fact where's that bitch with that ass?
In a away I'm tryna use her face
She says she likes to be laid back
Go hard on film and let her play back
Exotic actress, good times
She gotta shake down the niggas seat pulled way back, way back
She feel Mike Myers, hot, get into really got on fire
I tell 'er gon blow like wire
Rain on her tits round up by where gonna play at

Picture rockin' OJ, Shawty name when I'm thirsty
Shawty says she don't take shots
Margarita then ole
Dollar bills and they're stacked up
All my homies be racked up
DJ in the zone so this song's about to get back up
Plan again if you fuck with it, Ino be my city
Shout out to my tex niggas who throat bangin' in cell sleepin'
If you yell I'm here now
Lookin' for that good cush
That's all I want, you break down
Happens to me like George Bush

I'm on and I'm pullin' tron
Coffin on that stone got me feeling like I'm grown
Maybe too young to be just done
I don't care but it's too fun
And tonight I'm gonna get some
So I'm headin' down

Pour some liquor in my cup, shake it stir it up
Pa pa pass it up, keep it coming 'til I'm stuffed
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Give me your Shawty in my lap, we twirk it, make it clap
Then drop this to the floor get back up and throw it back
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

She got hip she got ass, she got eye she got face
She got lips she got 'fuck me' in her eyes
Now she got so many buns
She lick just like a teller
She say tell me when to stop but I don't ever tell 'er
'Cause fucked up when it's drink
I can't even think
All she see is money she can't even blink
All I see is switches and my nigga pimping
Now I'm seein' double but I'm still sleepin aah

I'm on and I'm pullin' tron
Coffin on that stone got me feeling like I'm grown
Maybe too young to be just done
I don't care but it's too fun
And tonight I'm gonna get some
So I'm headin' down

Pour some liquor in my cup, shake it stir it up
Pa pa pass it up, keep it coming 'til I'm stuffed
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Give me your Shawty in my lap, we twirk it, make it clap
Then drop this to the floor get back up and throw it back
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Champagne show how to campaign
Four whips in the air lane
Swatch it nigga hold that night
I ain't talkin unless you want a nigga last name
Pimps on the body, we can keep the cup
Let's lie to the crib, I wanna beat it up
The pen hot feel right
Heard this shit, know I gotta beef it up
And I'm gonna have to admit I'm gone
Always hopin' that you grown
Baby show me that thong
Shawty takin' this to the to sell for the cash she slagged out on that call
She slide down that pole, though I saw all these hoes
Damn that ass hittin' on smoke
Never see nothin' like it's but fo'
What it gonna take for you to go?
Want to smoke the L2O
Teen magazine the way she pose
Remember when she drop it down real low
To be discreet, nigga that fold
Got a nigga throwin' her only cash
The fast pussy they go

Pour some liquor in my cup, shake it stir it up
Pa pa pass it up, keep it coming 'til I'm stuffed
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Give me your Shawty in my lap, we twirk it, make it clap
Then drop this to the floor get back up and throw it back
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Pour some liquor in my cup, shake it stir it up
Pa pa pass it up, keep it coming 'til I'm stuffed
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Give me your Shawty in my lap, we twirk it, make it clap
Then drop this to the floor get back up and throw it back
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
And I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone</pre>
