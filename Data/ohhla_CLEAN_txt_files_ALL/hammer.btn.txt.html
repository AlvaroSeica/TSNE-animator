(Beatnuts Talking)
What, plow plow, (ugly-he) Ugly-he
yo beatnuts ya'll, how it go for a new era (fire) FIRE
Killa,  know what I'm saying (armory)
Junkyard, shine terykio P.R. ahh

[JuJu]
Tired of being one of the half knots
running around half-cocked
looking for trouble
find double
niggaz come near my car so they shuffle
believe me when the beef's with me the D's huddle
coming all of the wood
but that shit don't rattle the hood
Corona teach a nigga how to look good
tell u niggaz won't last too long
cuz the moon look bloody and the gat's too strong

[Marly Metal]
Better gates R.O. style
black escalades
fucking with gats they gonna find you in the everglades
me and looser
smoked about a pound of buddah
(gunshots) that's what I'ma do to ya
hard-hitting, leave you with your shit splittin'
half you niggaz out now is just be shit spittin'
top-notch
left hand holding my crotch
the other one on the glickitty-glock

[Psycho Les]
Heyyo Psycho's the name
let me remind you
you a snake in my grass don't make me come find you
my whole click starving like a jail cafeteria
while you on the block sucking cock up in Siberia
crack a cold one
blaze a hot one
turn the mic up let me drop one
when I release this, u better go cop one
if I hear my dogs barking I reach for the shotgun
we stand tall like the twin towers
and we pssss... piss on u cowards

[Chorus]
(Scream and gun click) Hammer Time!!
(Scream and gun click) Hammer Time!!(2x)

[Moonshine]
I hate niggaz that claim thug and won't be it
I'm tired of niggaz yelling cops when they don't see it
they shouldn't be here
u won't see me when the smoke clear
3 blunts, 2 shorties, and a cold beer
Big Moon
but I smoke too soon
spitting heat
rhyme to the dirtiest beats
love the streets that's the life and I like to live it
I got a right to get it, i'ma shine in the turn??

[Problemz]
Soon as I touch down
hit the deck splattering ya'll
blast all imitators
know about it and ya'll
baddest than all ya'll uhh
Deader that the president
and shoot down New York
Like that nig ???
Milly cats
so sit on them cats
four five we feeling ya caps
inferior scraps
shit, I'll fucking blast U man decker
Chick you gotta love it
and I grabbed the chick's ???

[Al Tariq]
Kevin Killaz be that nigga straight murdering tracks
herbing them cats
that can't flow on beats for shit looking at raps
hurting they raps with powerful paragraphs of punishment
believe me when I tell u, u don't want none of this
front on this and get ur snot-box rocked like Charles Dutton
that's the P.R.O line u though I wasn't still fucking
predict with this hypnotism
got u niggaz under a spell
heat tucked under my belt
frontin'' is felt
straight up and down with no preservatives
act like u heard of this
I'm from BK but they heard of kiss
little to nothing hammer time
niggaz start ducking
chickens start clucking
?? when the gat start bucking

[Chorus]

(Beatnuts Talking)
Hammer time ya'll
feel this come on
Iraq nigga shit u heard
come on...</pre>
