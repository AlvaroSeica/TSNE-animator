[Meek Mill]
I said I used to get high, Just to get by
Couldn't Deal with my reality, Was livin' in a lie
Sometimes I asked God is we livin' just to die
Conversations with my dad, And he livin' in the sky
I think am I goin' crazy? Or is this shit forreal
The spirit of a nigga who will or is appealed
Fightin' to see the light and I'm fightin' to keep it real
Like a nigga with no lawyer I'm ready to take a deal
Got me feelin' like Khaled, Cause all I do is win
I don't practice no religion, Cause all I do is sin
I don't even write it down, I'm just spittin' out what's in
I don't celebrate for victory man all I do is grin
Uh, Shit I ain't braggin' I don't boast
But when it come to bread fuck a slice I need a loaf
And a little bit of toast just to keep the haters off me
Man I do this for my city, All the niggaz waitin on me

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, Tell me what you see
Youngin' full of pride, Tendencies of a G
I never gave a fuck what ya' heard about me
Never told, Never sold my soul nigga this is me

[Meek Mill]
I'm a family man, Don't you ever cross that line where my family stand
I send them boys to come and get you in that family van
Cold shooters that love them hammers like Yosemite Sam
I'm from a hood where these niggaz scared to dream at
Fuck the money they wanna' kno where the lean at
They make ya' lean back, I'm talkin fade-away
Mike Jordan, Gettin' it ain't important
How can I forfeit, Niggaz makin' a fortune
Livin' in fortresses, Gettin' it on some corporate shit
Go hard or go home and this the orphanage
Same niggaz that I grew up I be often with
Small circle 'cause niggaz a murk you
Most of the time it's niggaz that know, But my niggaz is purple
Hearted, I seen the snakes before they even started
Caught em, And the was dearly departed

[Chorus]</pre>
