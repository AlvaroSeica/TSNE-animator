[Chorus: Lil Play]
Boy I'm doin me, and you should do you
Why you worry 'bout me? You need to worry 'bout you
Boy I'm-boy I'm doin me, and you should do you
Why you worry 'bout me? You need to worry 'bout you
Yeah boy I do, and you should do you
Yeah boy I do, and you should do you
Yeah-yeah boy I do, and you should do you
Why you-why you worry 'bout me? You need to worry 'bout you

[Twista]
{"Yeah boy I do"} Act-act-act a damn fool
Ball and I talk shit on every cut I do
{"Yeah boy I do"} Dress, dress like it's my duty
The stitchin in the pants match the brown in my Gucci
{"Y-y-y-y-yeah boy I do"} Blow-blow-blow one before court
Then pull on your block up in the new four-door Porsche
{"Yeah, yeah boy I do"} Talk, talk business on my cellular
Smoke a lot of weed and make money on the regular
{"Yeah boy I do"} Be-be-be-be about mine
Take my cars to the club in a single file line
{"Yeah boy I do"} Windy City campaign
Fuck the orange juice, I mix the 'tr√≥n with the champagne
{"Y-y-y-y-yeah boy I do"} A hundred thousand for the watch
Hundred thousand for the car, couple thousand for the block
{"Yeah boy I do"} Get-get nice I do
See the way the outfit match up with the ice, I do nigga
{"Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah"}

[Chorus]

[Twista]
{"Yeah boy I do"} St-st-stay fuckin with the crooks
Peel a backwood and mix the sour diesel with the kush
{"Yeah boy I do"} Smoke, smoke out my perimeter
The spit so-so-so sick that they gon' have to take my temperature
{"Y-y-y-y-yeah boy I do"} Stay flooded like a star
Make the color of the diamonds match the color of the car
{"Yeah, yeah boy I do"} Play, play a G shock
If I'm in the club, I got on the AP watch
{"Yeah boy I do"} Stay-stay sippin on the Goose
Then throw 20's at the thickest one in here that's gettin loose
{"Yeah boy I do"} The damn, the damn thang soon
As I get up in the motherfuckin champagne room
{"Y-y-y-y-yeah boy I do"} Range Rover white body
White 24 Vellanos while you sittin on Asanti
{"Yeah boy I do"} The t-truck candy blue
Suede interior killin them with the strut, I do cause
{"Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah"}

[Chorus]

[Twista]
{"Yeah boy I do"} No-nothin less than stackin dollars
And I stay lookin fresh in nothin less than Parish and Prada
{"Yeah boy I do"} I'm only fuckin with your boss
I ain't gotta break it down, I just get it all off
{"Y-y-y-y-yeah boy I do"} Mo-mo-move-move with the llama
Not a shark in the water, I'm a school of piranha
{"Yeah boy I do"} In the Maybach on my iPad
Shut the curtain on the haters whenever I ride past
{"Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah"}
