Typed by: Brooklynhazard@hotmail.com

[Chorus: Mims]
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
[x2]
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You hate cause you not
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You ain't cause you not (MIMS!)
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot, I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill, sayin' nothing on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggaz say that we lost it, so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty, cause niggaz show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit that shit, I watch 'em (get it on the flo')
And if you need it hyphy, I'll take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it everyday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit LA
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way
And when I hit the Chi', people tell me that I'm fly
They like the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it, and simply I reply..

[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
[x2]
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You hate cause you not
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You ain't cause you not (MIMS!)
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
16 bars, 24 a pop
44 a song, nigga gimme what chu got
I'm into drivin cars, fresh up off the lot 
Im into shuttin stores down, just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me what chu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Avvve
I hit Wash. Heights with the money in the bag
We into big spendin', you see my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggaz never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga this is what I mean..

[chorus]
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
[x2]
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You hate cause you not
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You ain't cause you not (MIMS!)
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot

[verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid, and I say yeah, I paid a gowp
And then I hit the switch, that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Creame of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em "All aboard"
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So everytime I see them, they tell me that's their song
They say I'm the bomb
They love the way the charm
Hangin from the neck, and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop 'n stare
Niggaz start to hate, rearrange they face
But little do they know, I keep them thangs by waist
Son I reply, nobody got to die
Similar to Lil' Weez cause I got the fire..

[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
[x2]
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You hate cause you not
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You ain't cause you not (MIMS!)
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot...</pre>
