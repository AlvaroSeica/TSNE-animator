[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I appreciate the love when I rock the stage
But I don't do this for props and things
It's nothing at all, it's Christ inside
That's got me spittin on the mic tonight

[Lecrae]
I'll probly never be the type to spend two bucks on fine dutch
But I want to touch hearts
I come to do what the Lord say
Got my lifestyle flipped to fit his forte yeah
I'm up early like moms and grits
Getting fed daily bread 'til my mind is script'd
And my rhymes intent is to point straight at the cross
Without using clever lines and {?}
I know you'd probably be impressed if I cleverly used my melody
To share Christ without using his name heavily
But I'd rather be saying his name so much
you could never get me confused or discredit me
'Cause I don't wanna do this, I used to be a Judas
It's only Christ in me that got me tryin to make it through this
I'm givin up time, givin up rhyme
'Cause it ain't about me getting mine dog I'm nothing

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
Ain't nothing sweet about me dog but Christ within
Prior to that your boy lived a life of sin
If you catch me givin up money so folks can eat
It's really God working through me dog
I'm not that sweet
And there ain't a bone in me that's naturally good
And without the fruit of the spirit I'm actually hood
Basically it ain't nothing great in me
But graciously my God likes replacin me
With his own characteristics traits and things
The wages earned from sin he erased them things
And gave me a new family tree
That the creator of creation hisself related to me
So if it seem like I shine bright in the limelight
Or I might think I'm tight man it's a lie right?
I'm gritty like J-Silas guess my worth
Man without Christ Jesus I'm less than dirt
I'm nothin

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
Cats say they gon change the game
This is Christian rap, why they barely using the savior's name
Got flows saying they rhyme is tight
Christ gave us breath to spit God gave us the mind to write
We don't deserve to shine, naw We just clay
I just came to lift up Christ and not what's my name
When I drop this flow it might sound ridiculous
But Christ smack dab in the middle so conspicuous
Homey it's not clever word play is not what the Word say
Christ in Him crucified all day e'ry day
But have it your way and blab your name
And Christ died you just trying to grab the fame
It's nothing but sound bites nothing but loud pipes
Speakin in vain man we nothing without Christ
We should use our last breath to rep the King Jesus
You shouldn't have to know our name after we leave here

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
I'm nothing, I'm nothing, I'm nothing, I'm nothing
I'm nothing, I'm nothing, I'm nothing, I'm nothing
I'm nothin</pre>
