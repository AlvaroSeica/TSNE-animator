[Tyga]
Looking at the ceilin, thinkin why - I treat you bad
Ain't no worser feelin than knowin I did it for the laughs
Arguin - all I was doin accusin you, my bad
Said "Let's take some time," never mind, rewind
Looking at the ceilin, thinkin why - I treat you bad
Ain't no worser feelin than knowin I did it for the laughs
Arguin - all I was doin accusin you, my bad
Said "Let's take some time," never mind, just playin with your mind
I always thought "play dumb," and let the other one love
Why get caught up, in a web of trust
Only love for fun, "I'm too young" I thought
All I wanted was the things, the Louboutins I bought
But it ain't your fault; heaven knows you deserve it all
You sent letters to my heart, but I burned them all
The Bible says before you run, gotta learn to crawl
but I don't wanna waste time if we ain't involved

[Chorus]
Oh oh, we've been through it all
I know I broke your heart once before but I'm done
Oh oh ohh, tell me what's wrong
I know I never listen but just listen to this song
Oh man; I promise we gon' do it 'til the sun come down
I swear it's goin down
I promise we gon' do it 'til the sun come up
Fuck it they don't do it, we gon' do it all

[Tyga]
Now the ceiling fan spinnin gettin dizzy man
Wonderin who she with, maybe should I call
"Don't be desperate man!" This ain't no tag you're it, hide &amp; seek shit
Reality just kicked in, I lost one and now she's winnin
Found another nigga she dig
Says he treat her like a queen, but she probably control him
Fuck that~! I gotta get her back to what we started
Start over again this time my heart's seein honest
Le-leave us, leave us, let's just, talk about it
I know before I wasn't, much of a man about it
But this time, I realize, I can't live without you
Believe when I say it's true - I love you

[Chorus]

{*"We gon' do it all" cut and scratched*}

[Tyga]
Love make you do it all
Goin up and down like a see-saw
Can't be a player, forever dog
It feels so good, but I know it's wrong
Muh'fucker drink what I'm sippin on {*3X*}
A bottle of love - tell me if it's too strong

[Chorus]
