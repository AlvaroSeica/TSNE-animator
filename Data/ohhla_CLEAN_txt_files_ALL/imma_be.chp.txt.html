[Choppa] 
I know ya'll prolly didn't expect, for me to come like this 
Grab the mic catch the track, and start to run like this 
There wasn't too many boys local, that was dropping like this 
But now I got your heads bobbing, and you jocking my shit 
So now you freeze up, thinking that Choppa was bout to ease up 
Please brah, where you get caught is where I leave ya 
Turn my shit up loud, so everybody could hear me 
And these player hating bitch niggaz, will probably wan' kill me 
This some real shit, I get off into some ill shit 
Make a mill quick, Steven Segal hard to kill shit 
Now chill bitch, I told ya this some ill shit 
And you might just get killed quick, now feel this 
Hi my name is Choppa, I introduce myself 
And if you mad for what I'm saying, that mean the truth was felt 
I proved myself, how many murders my block is long 
You don't need to know our numbers, but our stocks is strong 

[Chorus - 2x] 
I got much sicker I'ma be here, niggaz stuck with me 
Niggaz know I'm number one, they can't fuck with me 
Now it's next to hit the world, nothing else but me 
Platinum placks and a stack, on the shelf for me 

[Choppa] 
Now these busters, been pulling trash out 
It's time for Choppa to flip the mask to jack, go brag and take his ass out 
Rookie cookie ass niggaz, is bout to be bum 
Fucking round with Choppa, what the fuck you niggaz is dumb 
I told you niggaz, now I got to show you niggaz 
Blow you niggaz, get the car and roll you niggaz 
I'm from that wild west biggity, where things get off the higgity 
And I got the game, from my dog rep biggity 
You niggaz that ain't bout it, and that's why you still there 
I fuck with cats that pop caps, and put you in a wheelchair 
And I'm walking the street, you find suckers that try 
But as you know I'm from Marrero, so I'm packing that iron 

[Chorus - 2x] 

[Choppa] 
Puppy stunting and fronting dogs, you bucked up 
Growling at a pedigree pro, get fucked up 
Cooler than sick, so you niggaz that lucked up 
I still walk the street wit ya, till all my shoes stuck up 
Now them hoes scream Choppa, like when niggaz seen choppers 
That red beam dot ya, we that dream team partna 
Your throat to my throat, your note to my note 
No matter what you do, cause I'm still gon' showboat 
Now how many times, I gotta tell ya'll niggaz 
If I keep talking, then they gon' smell ya'll niggaz 
I know you niggaz heard, about them boys from that Dirty South 
Fuck the rumors fuck the fake, nigga this the word of mouth 
Hold up stop, won't ya wait a minute 
And just let lil' Choppa, put some flavor in it 
If you stay a minute, we can play the ending 
If a nigga stole my image, he couldn't hold my image 

[Chorus - 2x] 

I got much sicker, I'ma be here 
Ah-ah-ah 
I got much sicker, I'ma be here 
Ah-ah-ah 
I got much sicker, I'ma be here 
I got mu-I got mu' 
I got much sicker I'ma be here, niggaz stuck with me 
Niggaz know I'm number one, they can't fuck with me</pre>
