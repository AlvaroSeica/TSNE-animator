[Verse One]
Everybody got excuses which are useless
My niggas scientific died what about they sons and they futures
Niggas don't fight yo they shoot you
Now everybody think they hot like the gear that's stolen by our boosters
Not a thug but got thug tendencies
For rappers and enemies
Half pint of Hennessy
Stand on my own with legs like a centipede
Jumping out your car with ??? smelling like the scent of weed
While haters want to see us bleed
But my crew got mouths to feed
Y'all remain in court with a case to plead
Supporting cast, MIA won't take the lead
Not for fame or the greed
Get the fertile soil, lay it down, go ahead plant the seed
Throw up a three but I still give more
Cuz' ED O.G. has got a lot to live for

[Chorus]
Yo I got to much to live for
Yo I got to much to live for
I said I got to much to live for
Yo I got to much to live for

[Verse Two]
Some niggas scared to die but are scared of living
All the dirt that I did God is very forgiving
With the sharks I'm swimming, for the cake and the trimming
Get possessed by life, money, drugs and women
Striaght ahead dog with no stops kid
Don't want to get shot in my back like my pops did
Too many questions and not enough answers
Life's about chances, major labels and big advances
What I saw in my life will make the sofest nigga harden
Plus I keep it moving like Osama Bin Laden
Cuz' I got to give more
ED O.G. got a lot to live for

[Chorus]
Yo I got to much to live for
Yo I got to much to live for
I said I got to much to live for
Yo I got to much to live for

[Verse Three]
Look at this mess we in
Surrounded by a gang of sneaky thespians
With madd L's and no wins
If it ain't floss related, incarcerated
It quickly faded, or hardly ever made it
I ain't the one to hate it, to many imperfections
One of the few exceptions to stay hard like an erection
Ninety-nine new elections, by two thousand no more public housing
What you going rap about?
If I talk it, I'll back it up
You niggas need to stop rapping and wrap it up
I'm just trying to kick vocals, live amongst the locals
Refrain from the beefin' and the choke-holds
If you don't know me ain't a damn thing you could show me
I still keep it real with my homies
Yo, throw up the three but I still give more
Cuz' ED O.G got a lot to live for

[Chorus]
Yo I got to much to live for
Yo I got to much to live for
I said I got to much to live for
Yo I got to much to live for

RIP
Scientific LD
Uh, yeah
And my nigga Black
Coming back
What
Everbody on the boat
Humboat that is
What
RIP, keep living
It's all about living</pre>
