[Intro: Meek Mill]
{"M-M-M"} There's three types of niggas in life
Niggas that make it happen, niggas that watch it happen
And niggas that don't even know what the fuck is going on
Choose one, yeah..

[Meek Mill]
I got all these bad bitches twerkinâ (twerk) waves on swim, shit surfinâ (work)
I donât want yâall niggas âround me (front) broke niggas make me nervous (WOO!)
Shawty said she want that paper (WOO!) pop pussy like she workinâ (yeah)
Damn, a nigga finally famous; Rari by the Benz, Iâm swervinâ (SKRRT! SKRRT! SKRRT! SKRRT!)
Fuck rap, I might sell swag (woo!)
She want me âcause she know I got that Chanel tag (woo!)
She fuck me and she gone get that Chanel swag (let's get it)
Her boyfriend like "Where you get that Chanel bag?"
55 hunnid though, pop green and I ball like Rondo
Catch me Northside with a dime ho; turnt up but Iâm like keep calm ho
I go, make a million here, million there, all of my niggas, we really in here
Got a bad bitch, and she straight from the hood but she look like a foreign, brazilian hair
And Iâm grabbin' her remi, I bust like a semi -- yo bitch (BAH BAH!)
I get your girl pregnant, you hatinâ all on me -- you sick (HA HA!)
I ride in my hood in a Bently like itâs a Crown Vic (SKRRT! SKRRT!)
These bitches is choosinâ, you niggas is losinâ - we rich!
What'chu expect?

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Hah, wanna fuck with a dope dealer? (Dope dealers)
Or keep fuckinâ them broke niggas? (Broke niggas)
And I donât fuck with you ho niggas (NAH!)
Rollie yellow like Homer Simpson - thatâs dope, nigga!

[Nicki Minaj]
Uhh.. I got all these dope dealers servin'; cut the work up, they surgeons
I don't want y'all bitches 'round me, whack bitches make me curve 'em
Imported rug, that's Persian, one wheel up and we swervin'
Wetter than a lake, that's Ricki; pop pussy like she Nicki
She want me cause she see me in that Aventador
Pull up on the curb so crazy, I done bent the door
Bad bitch wanna borrow it, I lent it to her
Make her bust that pussy open in Singapore
30 million though, Forbes list; out in Philly in a condo, boss shit
Now they call me Young Oprah -- Harpo; in the +pool+ rockin' +Polo+, +Marco+
Millionaires, never do leers, no they can't see me, they're never my peers
Fruits of my labor, go get me my pears cause you're outta your element; I am your fear
So go get off my testicle, pardon my decimal, bitch!
Check up my resumÃ©, I'm upper echelon rich
Them bikes is out and we throwin' 'em up like we sick!
My clothing line is out in them stores and I'm sippin' a Myx - bitch!

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
HUH! HUH! DC, double M, Mastermind!

You say my name and bitch I gotta grant your wish (BOSS!)
Sticky fingers, 30K, you better drop that brick (drop that brick)
Philly brothers, sometimes they call me OCK! (call me OCK!)
I pray to God, everyday I drop my top (Thank you Lord!)
Humble man, with me and the Lord Meek (HUH!)
I'm the shit, coming down BROAD STREET! (WHOOOOO~!!)
Sal Magluta, Willy Falcon
Flamboyant dope boy, talkin' Al Capone (ROZAY~!!)
From Monte Carlo to Los Muchachos (Los Muchachos)
My Mexicanos not talking tacos (ohh yeah!)
This jewelry tampered once, a nigga push that button (BAP BAP BAP!)
On the corner Pac-Man Jones, these niggas donât want nothin' (hahahaha!)
You wanna fuck wit a dope dealer? (Dope dealer)
Or keep fuckin' them broke niggas? (Broke niggas)
My sneaker deal like A.I.'s (whattup boy?)
We drink Belaire like St. Ides (WHOOOO!)

[Chorus]
