[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Sheeeit~! I got the hook up, bitch! Whatcha know 'bout this?
Old school my whip, King Tut my wrist
I got the hook up, bitch! Whatcha know 'bout this?
I put on my clique, hoes on my dick
How you luv that? How you luv that?
How you luv that? How you luv that?
How you luv that? How you luv that?
I got the hook up, bitch! Whatcha know 'bout this?

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Fuck whatcha heard, hoe! They know 'bout the Krizzle
The Chevy on fo' Pirellis with the pole in the middle
I break a hoe if she brittle, pimpin hot off the griddle
Cluckin bustas freakin and fuckin for nothing
So how you figure I was trickin off?
Candy paint my Caddy frame, don't be ashamed to lick it off
Hail Mary some game to a dame and you cain't pick it off
Off the chain (HOO!) I cain't sic it off
Time and time again I try and tell 'em lemme kick it off
and BANG on it, put these lames on it
It ain't Multi if ain't put my name on it
Make that kinda track and put a train on it {*train horn blows*}
Styrofoam, +Purple Rain+ on it
Fresh up out the cleaners, my demeanor, not a stain on it
Reign on it, put some chains on it, bet the game on it
My woofer beat to the frequency that a bitch done came on it
Pinky rang on it, chinchilla get hanged on the flo'
I leave a bitch fiendin for some mo'

[Chrous]

[Big Sant]
Yeah! B-iz-I, G Sant, beyotch!
Young trill nigga, hoe you know just what I be 'bout
Time to take off them t-tops, we on that, like banners
Man hold up, my car older than yo' favorite rapper
This that shit that they should capture on film 
Lights camera action, life
Bitch my pimpin 1080p, without no satellite
My niggaz ain't actin right, talkin 'bout who run the South
They know it's us, they sick and ain't no Robitus' to help Â‘em out
I been official, big dawg in the yard
Voted most likely to murder every verse that I start
So as soon as I part, and I hop on that ride
Better leave witcha bitch, 'fore I'm off in her mouth
Cuz I'm a +Big Tymer+ rhymer, no co-signers around for you
If I ain't make that clear let me break it down for ya
They lame (yeah), we not (yeah), see us (yeah) on top (yeah)
Alumni forever ever BITCH! They know I got the

[Chorus]</pre>
