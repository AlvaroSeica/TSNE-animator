Fried Chicken, that's in a bucket
A side a cole slaw then I slurp it and suck it
Goes down smooth, just like my rhymes
Not like watchin a frenchie mime
That you want to punch
Uh, pass the Captain Crunch
Stayin' hard in milk just like my man
My panties are silk cuz I command
And when I speak aw they all come
Runnin' faster to the princess kingdom

Who's the Princess with tha master plan?
Superstar! Superstar!
Master plan! SUPER SUPER SUPERSTAR!
Master plan! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Me! (Wow)

She's got the flavor, she's got the flavor
She's on it
And I'm on it

Woke up, got outta bed
Put the Final-Net all over my head
Put the panties on my butt and then I fled
Wheredya go?
Went to work at the Chinese Restaurant
Workin' hard for stuff I ain't got
Servin' up the grease and oil
Gotsta know I'm still a royal
Superstar

Get Back, Get Back
Yeah I got the back and I gotya open
I see it in the dark I don't need no gropen
Put on my blades and do a little rollin' in the city
Hope now and it's time to relax
Do a little shoppin in Jersey cuz there's less tax
I find a sack and then I be smokin'
(what are you talking about you don't even smoke pot!)</pre>
