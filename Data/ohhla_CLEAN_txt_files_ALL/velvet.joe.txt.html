[Joe Budden]
The game is foul at both ends of it
There's no freedom of speech 'cause of this little thing we call censorship
As if that don't narrow our content enough
We make it smaller, talkin' bout rims and shit
Gettin jerked for the art, 'cause the art's now work
When you sittin' now writin' in penmanship
And now the radio's human, for it to fuck with
you gotta make friends with it
So I make some old radio crap
Since everything else on the radio's that
DJ's spin this, maybe go plat
And if it don't play, they'll say he's so wack
I'm everything, controversial
Underground, gangsta rap, slash commercial
(I'm) introspective, (I'm) slash reflective
Call the shit whatever long as you get the message
Call the shit whatever long as it ain't neglected
Long as it gets respected, yeah
Wack dudes going hard to be nice
Nice dues going hard to be wack, going hard for a plaque
Keep doin' what you always did, keep gettin' what you always got
Joey always hot, and it may seem I ain't always On Top
But I aim in more ways than I'm not
It's all twisted, nowadays can't fail to make the charts
Cause the stars made the sales, but now sales make the stars
Wish I could go back to the days of glory
It was all about music, less about the story
It's like a talk show, one long episode of Maury
One long episode that bores me
It's like a talk show, more like a soap
Can't change the channel, can't find the remote
I call it pathetic, some find it as dope
Some call it hard, I call it all choch'
I find it to be a big screen full of smoke
Stay in it long enough, you guaranteed to choke</pre>
