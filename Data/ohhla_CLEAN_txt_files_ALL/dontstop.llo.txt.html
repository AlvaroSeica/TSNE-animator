[Chorus: Chalie Boy] 
Baby the way, that you work that thang 
You sexy, so off the chain 
Girl you know, that you good at pleasing 
Why you stop baby girl, quit teasing 
Don't stop keep going, don't stop keep going 
I'm about to start blowing, I'm about to start blowing 
Let's go hard till the morning, going hard till the morning 
Don't stop keep going, don't stop don't stop yeah 

[Lil' O] 
Baby, you's a bad bitch 
Super mean walk, and you mad thick 
Pretty face, with them big ol' bag tits 
Nipples staring at me, like boy you should grab this 
Hold up, mama how you stay wet 
You gon' make me, take off this Latex 
And I know, that we 'pose to practice safe sex 
But you got me falling all off track, train wreck 
Whoa, fucking with the lights on 
G shit, yeah I kept all my ice on 
She got a lil' trick, called the python 
Once he put that squeeze on you, you would swear your life gone 

[Chorus] 

[Lil' O] 
I love it, when we kick it baby 
You know, that I'ma lick it baby 
My tongue, I'm gon' flick it baby 
Hop on this mustache, like do it baby stick it baby 
Yeah we think we porn stars 
Good weed, champagne and foreign cars 
Yeah this movie here, starring your's truly 
Sliding down the freeway, while she rubbing on my tooly 
Hold up, yeah this is player shit 
And I ain't never been one, to pay a bitch 
But the way you keep it real though 
It's punk change to me, you can have some for real though 

[Chorus] 

[Chalie Boy] 
When my love comes up girl, your love comes down babe 
When I pick you up, you know it's going down babe 
Don't play no games girl, you know I'm ready 
I'm bout to do my thang, now so hold it steady 

[Chorus]</pre>
