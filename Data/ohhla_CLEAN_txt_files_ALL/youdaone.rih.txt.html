[Intro/Chorus]
You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love

[Rihanna]
Baby I love you I, need you here with me all the time
Baby we meant to be, you got me, smiling all the time
Cause you know how to give me that, you know how to pull me back
When I go runnin runnin, tryin to get away from nothing yeah
You know how to love me hard; I won't lie I'm falling hard
Yup, I'm falling for you but there's nothing wrong with that

[Chorus] - 2X

[Rihanna]
Baby come, take me now, hold me now, make me come alive
You got the, sweetest touch, I'm so happy you came in my life
Cause you know how to give me that, you know how to pull me back
When I go runnin runnin, tryin to get away from nothing yeah
You know how to love me hard; I won't lie I'm falling hard
Yup, I'm falling for you but there's nothing wrong with that

[Chorus] - 2X

[Rihanna]
Yes I'm kinda crazy, that's what happens baby
When you put it down you shouldn'ta give it to me good like that
Shouldn'ta hit it like that, had me yellin like that
Didn't know you woulda had me comin back
You the one that I'm feelin, you the one that I'm lovin
Ain't no other {niggaz} like you
No there's just one, one, one, w-w-one
No baby just one, one, w-one, I bet you wanna know

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
