[Intro: Nas]
DJ Hot Day!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
This kinda love! Is a once in a lifetime groove! 
Reach out and touch! The love that I have for you!
Awww baby!

[Verse One: Mary J. Blige]
I see you standin there, so lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms, and tell you that your home
I look into your eyes, I said I know ya very well
I see a mirror of my life, a reflection of myself

[Verse Two: Nas]
3:45AM can't sleep, can't dream, I'm stuck
Money problems pop up, how will I survive
Guess it's best to decide not decide, so that's my decision
Whatever happens happen, I keep makin my millions
Could see myself in presidential campaign dinners
But I pass the blunts around a bunch of gang members
When your too hood to be in them Hollywood circles 
And your too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you loved and thought you would stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember 
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil, all you need is a skill
Then it's grind time
Imagination better than knowledge says Einstein, it's all in the mind
Nasty to nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic 
Just a minute after it's heard, you all will recite it
You all a repeat it, so call me a genius 
If you didn't now that I said I forced you to think it
Writin my little vignettes, sippin Moet
Bitch when you vision me you vision the best
When I was young they call me Olu son, now he's Nas father
I was the good seed, he was the wise gardener

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
This kinda love! Is a once in a lifetime groove! 
Reach out and touch! The love that I have for you!
Awww baby!

[Verse Three: Nas]
Yo! Beautiful life often I dreamed that I could bring my niggas
Conservatives don't understand slang linguistics  
The 'burbs talkin like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious 
Get out of gangsta business seem to me your thoughts are basic 
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine swishes in Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker 
Dope fiend neighbors growin up I've seen paper
I describe it, hope you could visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the projects
When My British Knights can rival your foam pauses
Don't make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Ha Ha!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
This kinda love! Is a once in a lifetime groove! 
Reach out and touch! The love that I have for you!
Awww baby!

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
I see you standin there, so lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms, and tell you that your home
I look into your eyes, I said I know ya very well
I see a mirror of my life, a reflection of myself
You remind me! Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Yes it's true baby!!!!</pre>
