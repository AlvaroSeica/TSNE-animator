(Supernatural)
I call it like I see it on stage like Supernatural
Internationally known

(Verse One)
I have, traveled the planet and touched many foreign lands
From the streets of London to the, African sands
I've always had a plan to make money expand
I can't count how many times a mics been in my hand
Who would of ever thought I'd have so many fans
Thats why I rock like every time is my last stand
I remember growing up, as a country boy
I never dreamed I'd have a gift that'd bring me so much joy
Now I'm a globetrotter, passport majorly stamped
Give me 25 minutes, crowd majorly amped
Whether I'm going third, second or first
I'm not gonna stop till I take over the earth
So thats why I rock and make places my own
I've traveled the planet just to serve fakers and clones
When it comes to this mic I'll never leave it alone
Thats how I got the rep, I'm internationally known

(Scratches)
Internationally known
(Supernatural talking)
Its like traveling all over the world
Many different places
Just to lace the mic
I live for the game
International man of danger
Lets go

(Verse 2)
No matter where I've been, whether abroad or the states
When I'm in the place they always recognize the face
The way the mic gets laced with impeccable taste
I'm known for stealing the show and leaving without a trace
And after that, its back to the bus or the plane
To puff a few L's and tune into the video games
Next state next place next mic next flight
No matter how tired, the show must be tight
So I'll rock for any crowd, whether you're black or you're white
This shit is easy to me like riding a bike
Or flying a kite, most deadliest on the mic
I'm like the king cobra with a poisonous strike

(Scratches)
Internationally known
(Supernatural talking)
You know, I live for the game
Worldwide traveler
The B-boy rolling
Not too many different boards
My mics for hire
Lets go

(Verse 3)
When I was in Japan, they was yelling ichiban
And for those who don't know, that means I'm number one
When I was in Paris, before I said I need a beat
I would pull up a seat and say bon apetite
The game got two flavors, one bitter one sweet
We ain't never gonna stop till the missions complete
When I was in Africa, I was revered as a king
This is the year were they kneel and kiss the ring

(Scratches)
Internationally known
(Supernatural talking)
I live for the game
I'll never let the game take me under
Forever I will remain interntionally known
Killing all clones and fakers
