[Chorus: Victoria Monet]
On the road 'til ya die
That unchangeable surprise
No waking up, but don't you cry
Let your dreams live on tonight
Ooh-ooh-oooooh-ooh-ooh-oooh {*4X*}
Live on tonight

[T.I.]
Yeah, yeah, Hustle Gang nigga!
Ay, le'go, ay

We do it big, goin hard, get it in
I tell 'em make my hustle, fuck fittin in
Who you know catch a Fed case, go to prison then
Turn around, do the same shit again {"Trouble Man!"}
Gone back {"Trouble Man!"} countin rack
A hundred K on champagne, hate I drown that {"Trouble Man!"}
Loud pack (loud pack) burnt up (burnt up)
Do it IMAX big, shawty turnt up {"Trouble Man!"}
The American dream, I'm livin in it
'Til Trayvon get some justice I'll kill a bitch e'ry minute {"Trouble Man!"}
Real talk, give a damn 'bout the sentence
Ye ain't down to die for somethin your life ain't worth livin {"Trouble Man!"}

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Yeah, that's right
+Family Hustle+ nigga! Go!

I'm livin so my sons and daughters never see martyr
Get it, spend it today, save somethin tomorrow
A young king's Arthur, learned from my father
Tomorrow 50/50, today is all ours {"Trouble Man!"}
That's why 24 hours, 365 days
Push it to the limit, switchin lanes on the highway {"Trouble Man!"}
Like fuck it, if I die today I die in pain {"Trouble Man!"}
I'm straight nigga, straight bullets in your driveway {"Trouble Man!"}
Man the game ain't a game, why should I play?
For my fam, my life, down I'll lay {"Trouble Man!"}
Put it on the line, never mind the consequences
Ye ain't down to die for somethin your life ain't worth livin {"Trouble Man!"}

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Uh-huh, I ain't finished, le'go

You know a Trouble Man ride with a hundred band
Bet it all, win or lose, it ain't nuttin man {"Trouble Man!"}
Modern day, near perfect, I'm the son of man
Every summer kill shit, call me Son of Sam {"Trouble Man!"}
Big chain (big chain) big car (big car)
I could buy a big house on my Black Card {"Trouble Man!"}
Them other suckers only wanna act hard
Hustle Gang, we jump off, floss stunt hard {"Trouble Man!"}
So respected, I don't even need a bodyguard
But if it fully-automatic then it's probably ours {"Trouble Man!"}
Real talk, give a damn 'bout the sentence
Ye ain't down to die for somethin your life ain't worth livin {"Trouble Man!"}

[Chorus]
