(*talking*)
I wanna say what's up to my niggas, but I forgot
Seem like all my niggas acting funny lately
Know I'm saying, you gotta be careful who you give
A motherfucking shout out to these days
Motherfuckers'll turn on you after the
Motherfucking tape drop, know I'm saying
Remember "Dedicated 2 U", all you soft ass
Pussy foot ass niggas, well this one
Dedicated to all y'all, hold up

[Z-Ro]
Jealousy and envy is surrounding me, try to keep it on the low
But the hate reveals the anger found in me, though I try to let go
Everybody wanna bump up, they got something to say, said I tried to let go 
Everybody that'll bump up, better have something to spray
In the midst of confusion, I'ma be ready for war no faking and flinching
Looking at a G, cause a G be looking like 
A million dollas, worth of straight pimping
Not telling a lie but I'ma tell the truth, these cats be living in sin
Could it be I sweared the jaw, but I'ma lose the tooth
With a fist I'm hitting his chin, who's afraid of the big bad beam 
That's shining like the burning sun, you's afraid
That I got a little mo' green, mad cause you ain't making none
Worried about the wrong thang, better mind your business
'Fore I mind it fo' you, fuck around and go to let loose
I ball with a beam, Z-Ro gon shine it for you
Fuck around and blaze a blunt, then I'ma pull a stunt
On the first and fifteenth, of the month
It's no need to front, it's no need to lie
So craftier, I'm ahead of my peers
Tell me why they wanna hate, trying to take what's mine
But I'm still on my toes, I take notes on hoes
That wanna get in my business, they stick they nose
But I'ma be strapped, with a salary cap
And turn all my partnas, straight to hoes

[Hook]
Look at all these niggas, surrounding me everyday
Better take ten paces back, I think I just might spray
Look at all these niggas, I can't take it no more
That's why my mug stay mean, with infrared beam
Cause it ain't no love no more-oooore

[Trae]
Everybody wanna turn they back on me
Better yet, they living a fantasy
Even niggas I thought, was down with me
Fin to end up, living reality
So deep in the mind, I'm so ready to click
And they wanna take that chance, to plex
Yelling out you my friend, nigga fuck you bitch
I gotta make divid-ends, stacking my ends
You don't wanna knock the best, and get put to rest
Nigga you so shife, get to where you got to go
If I see you again, you'll never breathe again
And try to take me out, you'll never win
See I'm a killa for real, with a skill I can't lose
Better get a bigger bitch, that'll pay your dues
I'm a nigga from the Maab, that'll check the front
You better pray to God, that you make it to choose
To save your blood, when it's time to leave
'Fore you be living so far, with a trick in the sleeve
Believe me, you'll burn for the misbehaving
And invading the hell, of my privacy
Knocking me, gotta keep my mama my riches
Ain't nan nigga, fin to stop the Trae
That's why I be solo, one deep on a mission
And living it, just to get paid

[Hook - 2x]
Stop that fronting bitch, you ain't down
Before you, lose your life

[Z-Ro]
Too many niggas around me
Will make my brain, come at my fist to swang
Slapping patches out these motherfuckers
Getting cuts from diamonds, in my pinky ring
And I really don't give a damn, really don't give a fuck
Bitch, you think I'ma play
Cause I really don't like, anybody in the way
Better smoke a sherm and calm down, I'm ready to spray
Everybody wanna say they my niggas
Son of a bitches, sure can lie nigga
Trying to get a good point, in the public eye
Steady trying to get a piece of my pie nigga
But I'ma ride nigga, so stay out nigga
Because a nigga, done broke your jaw nigga
Never pull my piece, to get applause nigga
I put a bullet between your eyes, right nigga
These cats wanna take me, off my game
Cause a nigga from the hood, that'll look some good
That done made some change, everybody wanna
Look at the fame, but that shit don't stop the pain
Everybody wanna take me off my game
Cause a nigga from the hood, that'll look some good
That done made some change, wanna look at
Material thangs, but that shit don't stop the pain

[Hook]
Look at all these niggas, surrounding me everyday
Better take ten paces back, I think I just might spray
Look at all these niggas, I can't take it no more
That's why my mug stay mean, with infrared beam
Cause it ain't no love no more-oooore

Fuck friends I said, your own partnas
Will be the reason, that you fall
My reply to you, is fuck em all
You gotta keep your mind on your bitches
And fake bitch made niggas, and crooked cops
Tell em, bitch I'm in a rush to ball - 2x

(*talking*)
Yeah bitch, still dedicated to you fake ass
Studio bump ass type niggas
Shife ass bitches, peep game recognize
Maab on the rise baby, for real</pre>
