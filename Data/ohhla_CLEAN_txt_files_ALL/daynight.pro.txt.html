Chorus

Theres nothin' to say
Hip-Hop has got is in chains
Its got is locked in a cage
as if am one of its slaves

Working day &amp; night
Thats just me way of life

Theres nothin' to say
Ah cannit stop, its too late
Its what av wanted for ages
So am stoppin' up late

Working day &amp; night
Thats just me way of life

Verse 1 (Yemm)

Am so depressed, ah hold hold me head
Ah dont know meself, am no ones friend
Ah get no respect, am owed the credit
Am more or less, alone but bet
That ah wont forget, when the shows ah get
Are all the best, nd av sold like ten
thousand, and they're callin yemm, just shouting
Ad walk to the end of the earth nd back
Am not kidding I might
I've been writing since I was 9
This is all a can do
This is all that I know
Its mine nd it brings is to life
I could do it in me sleep like a wet dream, this
Musics what ah breathe till, am set free, till
Am lying in a box, with me eyes like a cross
In the sky like a sky with me memories
Av selt me soul, like years ago
Its set in stone, the devil knows
Am raring to go, am destined to blow
Am determined, av invented a flow
That'll hurt you, like getting a blow
To your, am at the end of me tether
Am ready for war
With any... Body that'll step to is
So a suggest, that u go bang your head orr a wall
Ah settle the score when ah kick up a fuss
Tellin yous all, you can lick on me nuts
Am pressing record nd am rippin it up
From the second that ah talk till ah finish and put
The headphones down and turn the mic off
This life is hard, and ah write what ah feel
At the time coz its real
But I might stop, right now coz
Heres the chorus... Plus theres

Chorus

Theres nothin' to say
Hip-Hop has got is in chains
Its got is locked in a cage
as if am one of its slaves

Working day &amp; night
Thats just me way of life

Theres nothin' to say
Ah cannit stop, its too late
Its what av wanted for ages
So am stoppin' up late

Working day &amp; night
Thats just me way of life

Verse 2 (JP)

Me, meself and I
are always arguing all the time
we walk the line, between insane and genious
so man, ofcourse im wild
Am out me face, so brighter days
Are taken away by clouds and rain
Nd when it comes down it pours
so all that I know it is seems to go down the drain
I hate it, But it is what it is
N everything is what I make it
Nowts changing, N I always make
The bed that ive slept or laid in
Am patient, and i'll wait me turn
But beleive when I get it, i'll be eager as ever
To make it work, and when I get a grip
Al take the world and break it
So brace yisel, while a take a breathe
Am racing agen, am blazed agen
But feeling amazin agen, ive went
Way beyond gettin' wasted agen
Am High as a kite, nd try as yi might
Yi cannit pull is down from the height that am at
On me way to space, on a flight to saturn
Nd am drifting away and a might'nt come back
Am feelin' out of this world
man its insane, ah love the buzz
Its just what music does
I get way more from it
Than what I do from drugs
so who the f*ck is anyone else
To tell is anything different
Ah could make meself any more clearer
If I was made from crystal, Coz..

Working day &amp; night

So am stoppin' up late

Working day &amp; night

Verse 3 (Rekon)

Am alive! but don't believe am livin'
Everythings changed, but I dont feel the difference
Its hard to dream with a sleep deficiency
I dont know whats real or isnt
Is it me, or has it always been this difficult before
Am surrounded by people but I feel alone
Gotta keep on goin'
Plant those seeds, nd see what grows
But ends dont meet, am still depressed
And ah get no sleep, Am an S.O.B on days like these
Ah hate them all, ah Jus make the most
Its the way it goes
But sometimes life does faze me
So sometimes ah might look crazy
But its just a phase, it gets brushed away
Its not somethin ah fight through daily
Just lately its takin' its toll so
Forgive is if am stranger than normal
But ah cant help feelin distant
Guess the world am from is different than
Yours that you all live in so
you can keep on thinkin that am trippin
Coz a probably am
Av had four spliffs and a bottle of jack daniels
Ah think am in search of companionship
n this is the ship that has it
This mic, this booth, this rappin'
Its like writing tunes is magic
It calms is down like half an ounce in half an hour
Theres not a single beat that I cant devour
Its like the meals on the plate, and am starving now!

Chorus

Theres nothin' to say
Hip-Hop has got is in chains
Its got is locked in a cage
as if am one of its slaves

Working day &amp; night
Thats just me way of life

Theres nothin' to say
Ah cannit stop, its too late
Its what av wanted for ages
So am stoppin' up late

Working day &amp; night
Thats just me way of life</pre>
