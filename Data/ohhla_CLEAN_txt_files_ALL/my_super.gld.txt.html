[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey {*2X*}

[Santigold]
Well you're a liar and your cues are all wrong
But I can't count all the ways you woo me
I watch you capture what I can't hold
Now make it make some sense to me

[Chorus]
You are, you are my {*3X*}
Superman

[Santigold]
Hey, hey, you got to live
You got to live, you got to live
Me get hiiiiiiiigh; bless your soul
You get byyyyyyyyy; so take me along
But all the static here it's tearin you a-part, part
You can't help the way that you, you, you, you

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
Hey! You, you, you
Hey! You gain weight
So walk, walk, walk on now
You know you saved me
Don't-don't
Don't go hands down

[Chorus]</pre>
