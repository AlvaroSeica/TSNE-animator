Song:   Fallin' Up
Typed by: powermag@home.com

Just watch me (fallin up)
Just watch me (fallin up)
Just watch me (fallin up)
Just watch me..

[Verse One]
Focus on this, the ear seductionist
More the lyricist in this rap metropolis
More like an activist, we give it to you all
Presentation will make you have a ball
Sounds start conceiving causing you to meditate
Manipulate the line with hypnotical legislate
We far from the fakes, we never fake moves
But jealous motherfuckas seems to just disapprove (and talk shit)
And who the hell he be havin a fit
Yo, he ain't got shit, that's why he set trips
I identified what he rips
which consists of nonsense nothing less than bullshit
(Westside!) The fool can't hang
with the all around remainders, a real entertainer
Reviver of the true art form of, hip-hop
Explore non-stop, entertain ya till you drop

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We be fallin up (up) never fallin down (down)
We keep it at a higher level elevated ground
(Whether in your) area, (city or your) town
Black Eyed Peas is known for gettin down

[Verse Two]
Pick the course that ya take, is it fake
There's no remorse for a fake we must break
Time of rap sold some dough what we make (ah)
Yo, collapse, feel the force, full intake
Witness the Peas, as we innovate
Will's extraordinar, expose, instillate
Patternin pioneers, premier by cross the lake
Apl in fact if it's not my mistake
Taboo's unexplained means there's no escape
From it, hate it, love it, rate it as great
God gifted talent showin, that we create
Enough of bein deep - it's time to motivate

[Chorus]

Just watch me..
Just watch me..

[Verse Three]
I see you try to diss our function by stating that we can't rap
Is it cause we don't wear Tommy Hilfiger or baseball caps
We don't use dollars to represent
We just use our inner sense and talent
If you try to diss the Peas you'll get handled by Apl De the
{*growling sounds*}

Alligator, numero uno creator
Black Eyed Peas be more than a player
Don't got ta represent no set
just so I could get some respect
Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga got, cooooool
A lot of talent so I can get through
We're doin cause the way that you did it I think that you done corrupt
the whole hip-hop sound so now we gotta follow up

[Chorus]</pre>
