[Chorus 1: James Fauntleroy II]
So we made it to this same end of the road
and we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with myyyyy, so-o-o-oul, o-o-o-oh
O-o-ooh-ohh, o-o-ohhhh-ohhhh
 
[Common]
Ashtrays and cigarettes, last days, indigenous people
These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
The smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it, and still get invited to White Christmases
When I was born, three wise men came to visit us
One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle, then started giving gifts
"You from Chicago, we want you to deliver this
Show the walking dead who the true and living is
Separate the fake from who the REAL reals is"
Hot Tub Time Machine, back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spendin, drunk nights with storybook endings
I guess it's my addiction to women, ah!
I was in France, in to see Hennessy blendin
Writin my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams
Now it's new beginnings like a born-again Christian
On the mic, victorious, story is redemption
 
[Chorus 2:  James Fauntleroy II]
I'm sitting at the top, I'm not alone
I'm standing here with myyyyy, so-o-o-oul
O-o-ohhhh-oh-ohhh-oh-ohhh 
 
[Common]
Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves
Teach a man to cook it for survival
My dad said it rained on my arrival
Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow
Like I was 5-0, but my +Creed's+ Apollo
On the rock and roll with the coldest live show
For those before I came, I made the song cry for 'em
Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low
This is the Kilimandjaro, like Twitter you can follow
It may be hard to read like hiero-glyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo, check my youth revival
Truth inside flow, I stand/+Stan+ like Em did with Dido
Crash parties, any live, yo, is libel 
to get banged like thangs that rival tribals slang
From the pride we'll reign, KILL the game and watched it die slow
Ali MC, I fight for more than the title, your idol {*echoes*}
