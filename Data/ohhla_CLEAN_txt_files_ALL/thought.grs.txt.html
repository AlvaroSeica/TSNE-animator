Intro [Dame Grease]:
We have (we have)
Some the (some of the)
Exclusive (exclusive)
Hardest (hardest)
Vacant Lot ya'll! (Vacant Lot ya'll)
Yeah (yeah)
It only just because I told ya (I told ya)
Let's go Muh'fackaz (Muh'Fackaz)

Verse 1 [Tony Wink]:
Yo, I 'em payed dues for years, so I'm in to shot game
Even though I got a deal, I still hustle in the rain
Fuck fame
These cold streetz puffin' through my veins
Like a agent ?affected payin' me, wanna dig with the cane?
Young niggas comin' up fast, we wantin' the same
Lookin' back on 'em years, like the streetz ain't changed
Ten years in the game, still spinnin'
I'm still runnin', still gunnin' at foes
And money's still comin'
A half of these niggas is talkin' about it and get shit
Is the winky type of bite a block, just revere it
Live my life tactfree and don't give a fuck about nothing
A ?17's? fo' enemies a whole type of duckin'
So every picture's money I get, I'ma double it
Even if I'd sell a mill, I'd still be bubblin'
I still cop solo, can't trust no man
??? Meeno &amp; my nigga half dead
(C'mon) [Yeah] (I have told ya'll!, huh, die slow)

2x Chorus:
Never Thought that it would happen this way
After all this shit I did, never thought that I'd be rappin' one day

Uh, uh, uh

Verse 2 [Meeno]:
Never Thought I'd have a Benz
Fo' ?V twizzy?, when a dime's on a ?D-Throw?
You know the tinks
Never thought a nigga like me would cheat in the game
Taxfree money, still get a seat in the change
Never Thought of bein' taught, with me deep in the game
On the other side of the town with these weak ass lames
Never wanted to see "Live On Lenox"
Vacant Lot
Foot ya'll niggas, my crew will make it hot
Def to a man that saved alot
We do it all for the love of the kids, love of the block
Wanna start me poppin', love it or not
I've been through alot of Bullshit and you thought I forgot
Gotta get whut you deserve and I owe you alot
Cause we the ballin' niggas
Hard to fall niggas
Ready when it's time for thoughts, you cored niggas
Sendin' this shit out to all ya'll niggas
Wanna know whut we about, we ball on niggas
Vacant Lot, 99, Fuck ya'll

Chorus

Verse 3 [Baby Madison]:
Who would ever thought I woulda switch games
I thought all this crack money I gain
And all the cold nights hustlin' in the rain
Still runnin' from the cops
Game don't stop
Wanna restin' til' they catchin', I'ma had it the game
Back my coke to blast
Nigga rubbers' been on my nuts
The free work is on the block
I ain't tryna get knocked
Supplyin' with the light tops with plastic glocks
I'ma ball til' I drop whether you like it or not
When it's on, so they dump, blamin' on Vacant Lot
We niggas makin' it hot, we about to drop
Talk slick and blow ?droh?, I be blazin' tribes
Watch your mouth and your man ?off? I be diffin' the back
Grimmy niggas lay back, slingin' raps like crack
House full of Platinum Plaques, I did it at last
Dirty money to green cash, to the best throw wacks
And if you can't except it, then nigga respect it
Number One on Billboards, better run and check it
Uh!

2x Chorus

Outro [Dame Grease]:
I never realized life can be so simple, baby (so simple baby)
Haha ha-hah (Haha ha-hah)
We doin' this for the kids (doin' it for the kids)
We doin' this for the love of the block (love of the block)
It's all we got (It's all we got)
Ya know whut I'm sayin' (Ya know whut I'm sayin')
Whut you livin' for (Whut you livin' for)
Cause whut you love (Cause whut you love), 
is whut you hate (is whut you hate)
Ask yourself (Ask yourself)
You can never be like us (You can never be like us)
Respect yourself (Respect yourself)
It's on you to hold it, kid (It's on you to hold it, kid)
Fuck all ya'll! (Fuck all ya'll)</pre>
