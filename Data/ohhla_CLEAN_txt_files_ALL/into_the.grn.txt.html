Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Before I'm done I'm a run this, run this
Before I'm done I'm a run this, run this
Before I'm done I'm a run this town. Into the ground

[Verse 1]
Dilute me, water me down, how?
There's more chance of me courting a cow disappeared, last seen walking around
At 27 with a sign saying 40 and proud
Does Katie look like amy, or amy look like Katie?
What the fuck are these cosmetic surgeons creating?
I'd never imagined shagging a mannequin
But that vajazzle is, so bedazzling
I want the light skinned chick from the misfits
To pull my pants down and tell me if this fits
When I say I'm a big prick; it's my dick talking
I can't help it, I'm a bit of a dipstick
Sadistic, come on cunts! insult me I insist
A dimwit with a dick covered in lipstick on the prowl, walking around zipper down; dick sticking out!

[Chorus]
Before I'm done I'm a run this, run this
Before I'm done I'm a run this, run this
Before I'm done I'm a run this town. Into the ground

[Verse 2]
Who wants to fuck with me now?
A half wit with a fringe started it an he's stuck with me now!
I'm hunting him down
Wow, how could he accuse me of clucking over crusty the clown?
You're in trouble, prick, I'm in a muddle, prick
Prick, is that your chick or mick hucknell, prick
Dick, minge you puss

I pray for the day I find him face down in that ginger bush
Imagine cheating on your wife
Footballers are as sleazy as you like
Imagine sleeping with the wife of another
Imagine sleeping with the wife of your brother
Imagine if I said Imogen, I may do

If I hate you, for me to name an shame you ain't nothing
Make a mistake an say something, nothing
Not even an injunction with a cape could save you

[Chorus]
Before I'm done I'm a run this, run this
Before I'm done I'm a run this, run this
Before I'm done I'm a run this town. Into the ground

[Verse 3]
I don't say this to all the girls just you, because I trust you, come here slut I need a drug mule
I do these things because its fun to
I don't need a mule for drugs
I just wanted to see if you were in love enough to put drugs up you?
Now you've got a clung full of monk and mushrooms
I really can't believe you called my bluff
I ain't fingering your chick I'm looking for my drugs
Why think about what I say? I say what I feel
Women call me rapey, I say cop a feel
The worst day on this earth was the day I got a deal
I ain't been the same since the day I dropped a pill
I ain't lost appeal I got appeal though
Spit hard kick rhymes with a steel toe

Cap, been bad with a real flow
Back, intact an I'm still pro, rah!
Your opinions ain't shit to me
I couldn't give a fuck what you think of me
I may contradict myself as I change and I grow
Though my bet'd be I'll be this way till I'm old
From I was young I've been toolong in the tooth
I ain't down with the trumpets I ain't quirky or cool
If I've offended you and you're coming to get me?
Just know if I'm going to hell you're coming with me

[Chorus]
Before I'm done I'm a run this, run this
Before I'm done I'm a run this, run this
Before I'm done I'm a run this town. Into the ground
INTO THE GROUND</pre>
