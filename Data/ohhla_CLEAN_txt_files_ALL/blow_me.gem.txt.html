Chorus: Note
Girl, you blow me away
The way you lick your lips
That sexy look on your face
It turns me on, and girl
You blow me away
The way you switch them hips
It's not much more I can say
You blow me away

[Big Gemini]
(Verse 1)
Fresh to death, from head to toe
Mastered this, I got the glow
All I need, is a Vanity with me
And I could the chick out and just make 'em blow (Blow)
When I'm floatin' by
Can't see nothin', goin' 95
Place your bets on the golden child
I been gone for a minute, but I've arrived
But now, I'm back on mine
Seen a shorty so fine
Lookin' like J. Lo
Only from behind
Hey
I bet ya man can't even handle that
He
He probably got some money in the bank
It's obvious that he's sprung on you
He got them hot handcuffs tighter than the police do
He better let you breathe, 'fore you spead them wings
Or better yet, spread 'em out and fly over to me

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Heartthrob, never, still do it better
Better than the west, fuck tellin', I'm a show ya
Come a little closer, I'm a have to snatch it from him
By the way, you keep lookin', I can tell that you don't want him
Girl, you blowin' my mind, like the purple kush, high
Licking on that straw like a lollipop
I replace that straw with someone you want
Just don't bite it (Don't bite it)
Don't bite it (Don't bite it)
Hey
Make your move, I'll make mine
And really show to you the one I want, but they in line
For me
Ain't it funny what some money bring
And you
I know you ready, but you play it cool
Hey
You takin' too long, baby
Now it's two o'clock, so it's, "So long, lady"
This could've been you, but I'm leavin' with her
And I leave you right there with ya square
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Repeat Chorus

I can't control myself

That look on that face, girl
