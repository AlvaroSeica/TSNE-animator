[Chorus: Bounty Killer]
I pull the trigger, make the people hurt
Now one of dem might tell, whoever figure
I pull the trigger, make the people hurt
Now one of them might tell, whoever figure
Get outta here~! No friends here
Gun clap on ya, we launch new dere
One match and now drag your holsters in here
Just saw you run up, who did dem dere

[KRS-One]
Look, look
These motherfuckers know who's the best
If it ain't Buckshot, it must be KRS
I spit the most rhymes in hip-hop's history
That means no rappers spit more spit than me
I'm quick to see a rapper
Get the duct tape out, y'all start breathin faster
KRS-One, he's a master
A teacher, like when I speak it faster

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[KRS-One]
Yeah, yeah
You don't want the righteous to spark and ignite this
I stand for peace but, some wan' fight Kris
That's when I get the hypest
I'm like Tina Turner with long legs, you what Ike is
I'm where the mic is, I'm where Buckshot at
All that car, ice, money, crack - fuck that rap!
This a new day dawnin, y'all get to crawlin
Duck Down, this the first warnin
Huh, emceein is my callin
It's my genetic structure, we BACK motherfuckers!
And we black motherfuckers
Dreadlocks, du-rag, hip-hop rap motherfuckers
The streets is mine
M-I-N-D, y'all way behind time
I was savin my shine
But now I think it's time to Buckshot in '09

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Buckshot]
Stand clear, gun man ah talk
What dem shout 'bout hip-hop done off in New York
Watch out! Run dis here
KRS and Buckshot run dis year
The father of the flow and the son is here
So I shine, you shine, put one in the air
From the K-R you underestimatin
BDP beat you down with patience
Or, BBI{?} bring down the inflation
Cause the government'll want you with the money, they hatin
Can't take it, well get an education{?} and do work
Follow my formula to make it and do work
See, the hip-hop foundation was Kool Herc
{?} said she went through her stages, I need her
I do prefer to stop the violence
But if you stop my progress I'm gon' stop the silence

[Chorus] - 2X w/ ad libs</pre>
