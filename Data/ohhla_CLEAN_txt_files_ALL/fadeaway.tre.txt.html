[Trey Songz]
My heart is beating fast
My hands won't stop shaking
I thought that we would last
I thought that we would make it
I guess I was wrong all along
We were inseparable but apart we've grown, so 

[Chorus]
Can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone
When you look around your all alone cause all the right went wrong
Tell me how you look into my face and say baby I can't stay
What do you do when the love just fades away?

[Trey Songz]
The situations ugly
I miss the way you touch me
Do you even want me anymore?
Let me know...
Cause I'm tryna to figure us out
I don't wanna break up
What's the use when there's nothing left

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Was this ever true?
Did I ever love you?
Baby we were caught up in the feeling
Oh did you ever care for me cause if so then where'd it go?
Are we giving up I need to know or are we holding on

[Chorus] - repeat 3X</pre>
