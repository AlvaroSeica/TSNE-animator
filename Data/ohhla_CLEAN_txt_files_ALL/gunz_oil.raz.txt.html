(Intro)
Renaissance!
Gunz, Oil &amp; Drugz
You see it inside their court rooms
We bout to stand up man!
They say 'In God We Trust'
But what GOD is this?

[Hell Razah: Verse 1]
We get our guns outta VA
Accused by that new DA
"Build on it God" but what about the USA?
M16's &amp; AK's playin' our music
The way the shit seem were gon' need a better solution
They got the FEDS on our distribution
We got em fed cuz we be a movement
It ain't no constitution
But it's ok when the cops is shootin'
Who gotta die next?
Before we rise out these projects
They shot Pac and no suspects
They shot Biggie that's enough deaths
We got our suns left
We on the run till our last breath
May justice let our souls rest
We get revenge through our success

(Chorus)
Gunz, Oil &amp; Drugz
This the GOD that Americans love
We don't trust no political thugs
But where we gettin' it from
Got United Snakes wired and bugged
For war-crimes swept under the rug
So now I'm askin' the judge
This the GOD that Americans love?
They even robbed the planet earth of its blood
Gunz, Oil &amp; Drugz

[Hell Razah: Verse 2]
It's like a plot in a terrorists brain
That was trained to put bombs in our high-schools, bridges and planes
Patriot games, unexplained chemical flames
Left us widows of the World Trade feelin' the pain
Now the blame got Barack Hussein
Gotta explain...
Is he framed or its blackmail?
Its even harder to tell
When you in jail, or you under a crack spell
Its just rebellious times of blind leaders
My mind's deeper
Then the vines inside reefer
Therefor all my rhymes is not ether

"Build on it God"

[Hell Razah: Verse 3]
Before the planes crashed in Manhattan
The Bush family "bin" in business with the Bin Laden's
The paid assassins then they raise the gasses
They use taxes as a mere distraction
Send our soldiers back in wooden caskets
Exxon is what killed Saddam
Colin Powell step for the next Uncle Tom
But Dick Cheney wasn't charged for his firearms
When North Korea bout to be another Vietnam
Energy ex-cons, robberies in Enron
Ariel Sharon - country steady being bombed
Its Global Warming every morning that your TV's on
Kill or be killed
Blood suckers of the oil fields

(Chorus)
Gunz, Oil &amp; Drugz
It's the God that Americans love
We don't trust no political thugs
But where we gettin' it from
Got United Snakes wired and bugged
For war-crimes swept under the rug
So now I'm askin' the judge
This the God that Americans love?
They even robbed the planet earth of its blood
Gunz, Oil &amp; Drugz

(Outro)
It's crazy
They need enough oil so they can go to Mars
Then they gotta rob the planet off all her blood to get there
