[Pro the Leader]
Easily maneuvering through flows
Here to assassinate the president with a shot to his temple
No one can take me out with subliminal messages
Carrying rocket launchers in leather packages
Delivering time bombs in over night packages
Making my way through dark stair cases and mental passages
Unfasten your skull with electro-magnet
Fuck classic, my rhymes will be antique
Definitely unique, incredible, unforgettable, like Nat King Cole
Professional is Sobretti...
I got a claw hand, stick a knife in your abdomen like Freddy
And we got Warcloud in the house, Professional 'bout to turn the party out
I used to do heroin, dilute it then I snort it
Stick it to aluminum foil and watch me smoke it
Strait dope addict, attracted to acid
Thinking its a nice day to walk out to the middle of traffic
Slam my 40oz down just to watch the glass shatter
Shape-shifter, technique mind over matter
A multitude of tracers appearing from the asphalt vapors
Decimating you haters, creating craters
Nearly perfect sentence structure, microphone alien abductor
Tear this whole shit down
Percussion destination got you facing elimination in my town...
Mother Fucker (WARCLOUD!) Mother Fuckers...

[Holocaust]
I live in a hollowed out asteroid, its WARCLOUD!
Better living through circuitry, Paleolithic surgery
Half man, half planet Mercury, I hurt MC's
One day it rained and the people began to melt
Release the angles in the Euphrates River who sleep
To slay a third of Earth's population for vindication
A dirty helicopter, my blades are my swords
When I descend upon you the sound of a zillion chariots
Nightmare room of truth cause it's the scariest
Men made of heads who eat inside the lake
Shadowless zombie swordsmen, chills
Swoop up on you and launch your head in the hills
Sword mechanic tragic, mastermind Jurassic
Laughing outnumbered, leave you bloody construction yard
Shatter spirit shields with lyric fields
A one armed ghost samurai from the past that murdered un-Godly
The thunder struck oddly, I blast a dusty shotty
Three gauged hideous slump your carcass the grittiest
Angry wood cutters, shoulder fins, motion switch
Blizzard kicks break soundwaves and astounds slaves
Dirty mauler meat market massacre, mirage
Crash the like the hammer of the Gods and leave you lodged
Under heavy doors explore these warlords
Mystic paradise, my axe closet with shovels in it...
9 million ninjas fall upon you with light sabers
Cannibalistic neighbors, Ghost Pirates and heartless Raiders
Old gator man who is seldom seen
He lives in a cave made of moths with dusty wings...

[Road Block]
Stratospheric absorption, Anubis is deadly bomb like abortion
MC's is fetal fecal material, in Laboratory trial with evolving styles
Manipulating to mutation, for this they blame the game, I'm blaming the nation
Through Astral concentration, The Mars surface is a hype service
Secret bleed trinkets, wipe your memories, clean slate
Roadblock stuck in the path, pause the mind state
My razor strait steaks, crack chest bones
Sewn to cenobites, held club fights with Tyler Durden
I been a high hermit, avert my pervert
My nerves hurt from rappers that 'Jabber Jaw'
I'm raw, Rock do you smell what I'm cooking
It doesn't matter, my abstract rhymes is phatter and tatter tanks
Bank fag pirates and drop them off the plank so they can swim with a Mayko
Snap skeletal from your speak box, in battle tournaments call me Kano
Lyrics unclog your brain like Drano, so keep out of reach of children
Illin from poison liquid spilling from my tooth frame
I am ?suit sang? and praying to a mantis
To increase my fighting skill, depth is beyond Atlantis
My attitude don't smell nice, you call it rancid
I'm like acid putting ripples in Lake Placid
Then I death both croc's ??? and sock jocks, they bones pop
And hearts drop out the foot, I'm dirty sut corky cook
So don't eat the dinner
It's a voodoo magic contest you get thinner and I'm the winner</pre>
