[Alley Life]
Out with the old, in with the new shit
Mark said "Keep it clean," do this
Straight from the streets, run and tell 'em new kid
B.P. is back with the, new shit
Who this? Press don't be a stupid
Useless, why you so damn doofus?
A-L-K still be the truest
If you bad mouth me, then you gettin two hits
One to the eye, shit, one to the lip
And all this here comin straight from the hip
And all I wanna do is just make music
and get paid, like the Slim Shady dude did
For the love of the game I'ma, do this
Get rap like sex 'cause I, move it
And I'ma sit around for the revenue split
When the band all together takin better {?} trips
'Cause I...

[Chorus: Alley Life] (Black Planet)
Bein in the band is hard to survive
When you're playin in the bars and clubs to get high
(OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW SHIT!) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah {*3X*}
(OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW SHIT!) Yo, yo, yo, yo
What they want? Yo, I think they want - (MO'! MO'! MO'!)
Well, how you know? 'Cause they all was screamin - (GO! GO! GO!)
Yo, what they want? Yo, I think they want - (MO'! MO'! MO'!)
Well, how you know? 'Cause they all was screamin - (GO! GO! GO!)

[Alley Life]
Who was the people screamin "Go! Go!"?
The same ones that was screamin, "Mo'! Mo'!"
The same ones that outside the front do'
Them the same ones gettin hyped in the front row
Also, shit I like to blow dough
Get drunk, throw-up right before shows
Do it in the open or on the low-low
I don't give a fuck, FUCK THE PO-PO'S
Yeah, I'm thuggin, down to throw blows
Cool with it too, bound to go-go
If I can't get one pound of the dro
Blaze and get laid 'round the whole globe
Yeah, I like women, we take the whole row
We got bitches, at the mo-mo
Meet at from 2:12 to 2:44
Do whatever in the morning, we gotta go, go, GO~!

[Chorus]

[Alley Life]
Hooold up! 
Now I know you ain't tryin to be cute, and not salute soldiers
See I'll expose ya, for the dirty rat you are
Found you ain't hard, then yo' life got scarred
Turned around and playa hate my shit
Private, AT-TEEEEEEEENTION~!
Forward march, to watch yo' camp
Don't be comin 'til it's dark, check my style
Watch me now

[Chorus 2]
Yo, I think they want - (MO'! MO'! MO'!)
Well, how you know? 'Cause they all was screamin - (GO! GO! GO!)
Yo, what they want? Yo, I think they want - (MO'! MO'! MO'!)
Well, how you know? 'Cause they all was screamin - (GO! GO! GO!)
Yo, yo, yo
