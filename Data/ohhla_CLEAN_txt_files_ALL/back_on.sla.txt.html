[Royce Da 5'9"]
Slaughterhouse family, ridin like a taxi
And yeah, I'm like Dres, I am like the +Black Sheep+
I just want a, GANGSTA bitch, or I be a bad G
You sound dry, your legs look a lil' ashy
You thought what you said was +Classy+
But Slaughterhouse been about bread since Freddie Blassie
Freddy'll say nasty, I'm a rap assassin that's sittin in the Aston
that's cleaner than the demeanor of Eddie Haskell
Call me a defensive BACK on the track spit
And that Slaughterhouse pigskin you couldn't put it past me
We done, been through a whole lot in the past
Cause niggaz bash us for bein spazzes
Let it be known we never known for bein average
We prime like the Corleone re-enactment
When it comes to talent, we the Jacksons
Eat a track, we assassins
We, mean, we back on the scene

[Chorus One: Dres]
Back on the scene! Crispy and clean!
Back-back on the scene! Crispy and clean!
Back on the scene! Crispy and clean-clean!
Back on the scene! Crispy and (SLAUGHTERHOUSE!!)

[Crooked I]
You spend twenties on flowers, me I put doves on the rose
That's why I'm in the club with your hoes
What you lookin hard for? Don't spill escargot
on yourself, and get slugs in your clothes
We the ones with the flows
Who hit 'em with the dope lines? The answer's right under your nose
Whenever hip-hop's fallin off the track
We pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, 'til we back
on the scene, crispy and clean
Fix me some whiskey and lean, bitch we the kings
Only time your music is fly is when I
use your compact disc as a frisbee to fling
Pyoon! I'm a cold young - nigga
This your hoe come - get her, cause I'm so done - wit her
Made her whole tongue - glitter, with the old cum - spitter
Hit her then slide home, homerun hitter

[Chorus One]

[Joell Ortiz]
Yaowa! It's a wrap for your team
When I get in that ring I put rap in a fiend
I don't know what's happenin-ing
Either I'm gettin better or y'all fallin off like the sag in my jeans
Relax and I'm clean, immaculate lean
And go in my two-step, somethin fat in between
Haters, don't get mad at my dream
Opposite's attract, I'm nice and the track is just mean
So I'ma fuck it up, flow {?}
Olive button up, Bo Jackson's and green
Fresh fitted cap on the bean
Sorta like a spine on a movie screen, back on the scene
Back under that light's like a gat with the beam
Back at the register with the plastic machine
Back wearin my gold like Magic, Kareem
Back in them rap magazines - click!

[Chorus Two: Dres]
Back on the scene! Crispy and clean!
Back-back on the scene! Crispy and clean!
Back on the scene! Crispy and clean-clean!
Back on the scene! Crispy and clean!
Back-back on the scene! Crispy and clean!
Back-back on the scene! Crispy and clean!
Back on the scene! Crispy and clean-clean!
Back on the scene! Crispy and (SLAUGHTERHOUSE!!)

[Joe Budden]
Check it, them rumors you heard about me I refute those
The attributes of hoes, don't affect my attitude at all
Die from what you told, blood on your new clothes
Cause even the biggest form of Nuvo{?}
What they want so glock's wit 'em, be in a box wit 'em
Try and box wit 'em while he got the ox wit him
Dot the I's/eyes wit 'em, whole life's a rehearsal
Cars got the horsepower of that Old Spice commercial
Silence when a vet's speakin, I'm jet skiing with lesbians
You just seein wantin to just be him
In the casino (no) spendin petty cash (cash)
No worries, I'm the same as what you met me as
Bitches sayin, "Go ahead with your sexy ass"
Y'all can have my heart, you can get it out this plexiglass
Here's a message to the haters
I'll take money, power and fear, the respect'll come later

[Chorus Two]</pre>
