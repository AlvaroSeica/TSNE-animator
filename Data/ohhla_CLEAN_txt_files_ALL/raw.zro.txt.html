Say Mike D dig these blues

[Verse 1]
Here I go again running off at the mouth again about busters
Motherfuckers just mad at me cause they diamonds ain't up in clusters
Too many times I done paid my dues
Even Today I'm still paying them fool
Could it be the reason I'm so cold up in the rap game
This motherfucking thang
I'm screaming JESUS I need a better way of life
Cause at the rate I travel I can't decipher day from night
Still the King of the Ghetto
The ghetto is where I lay my head at, evade feds at, break bread at
These somma of a bitches got a nigga fucked up
My attitude is already rude 
And too many people make me paranoid so I wet a bitch and I wet a dude
Staright like that I don't give a damn I'm Gangstafied
From toe to head
Nuff Said
Flipping in a gangsta ride
And when it get Gangsta a gangsta will bust heads
Its in my blood
I'm a motherfudcking thug even though I know better
My only love is for my Guerillas and for the Cheddar
So all you mark ass niggas Get the fuck up out of dodge
Get your life right with GOD
Then if you want warlets go to War

[Verse 2]
It be a bunch of drama on my block
My partna accidently shot his mama on my block
Tryin to survie in the land of the lost
Hoping I can at least find me
Cause back in high school ain't naan one of my teachers reach me
I wasn't cutting up in class I had money on my mind
Visualizing a motherfucking come-up
Ready to get up and grind
Chasing paper like a motherfucker Me and Buddy Ro
Moving ounce after ounce of that yayo
Making money what I love to do
But my freedom is pending
And if I get caught slipping my freedom is ending
Nigga I'm playing it safe
100's and 50's and 10's and 5's and 1's up in my safe
357 and a foe-foe in my waist, a maniac 
Trigger happy and don'tr give a fuck what I be aiming at
Ridgemont fa lea forever I'm claiming that 
Ridgemont fa lea forever I'm claiming that 

[Verse 3]
My niggas be killing each other behind these busted bitches
I would rather be spending my time in a drop top with something live on switches
With a sack of that shit so I can calm my nerves down
Dealing with bitch nigga after bitch nigga I'm ready to release rounds
Out of the mini 1-4 I'm a shoot til it's over with, ain't nobody gon stud up
Anotha one bites the dust, I'm throwin that pud up
Nigga what
I'm ready to kill and I'm ready to die its the cause of my life
The reason why I'm anti-social and built a wall around my life
Ain't nobody but me, Z-Ro The Crooked in the flesh
Mo City TEXAS ain't no fashion show, niggas come here and meet death
It'll be a battleground with nothin but dead enemies of myself
Cause when I be clicking I be feelin a strange energy within myself
I never be giving a damn about it cause it be feelin so live
So when I be doin that there, don't fuck with me try take me outta my vibe, nigga
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 never gonna let the game go... fa'sho</pre>
