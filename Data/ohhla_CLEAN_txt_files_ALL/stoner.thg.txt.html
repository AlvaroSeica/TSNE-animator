[Intro]
{Dun Deal on the track!!}
Ay ay this that stoner music nigga
STONER!! STONER (Let's get it)

[Chorus]
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner)
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (stoner)
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a motherfuckin stoner
I just put a forty on my wrist just like a boss
I just put ten thousand on my bitch just like a boss
I just came from YSL just like I'm a, boss
Just like a, boss, just like I'm a... boss boss	

[Young Thug]
Thugger thugger, youuuu
I want Micheal Jackson land, oooh
Oh, I'ma cash out on it
I'm high as hell I ain't got no satellites on me
I told a bitch I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel just like Fabo - FA!
I'm back at it, Jugg Man voice
(Young rascal, hahahaha) Bankhead
Hear my song way from the Y-T-C
R-O-B, S-&amp;-M, now we YSL venom
Slime Thugger wit it, slime DK wit it (slip)
Slime wicked wit it, slime window wit it (slime)
Slime slugger wit it, slime Bubba wit it
Slime checks wit it
Got hundreds and fifties off everyone's city

[Chorus]

[Young Thug]
Run that money up, like you 'bout to start trial
When you beat the cases, turn into a stoner child
We don't stand in line, foreign shoes hurt your feet
Everybody stoned, weed, lean, Molly, E
Everytime I walk inside the club I see e'rybody lookin
You know I'm a stoner, I love drugs and I cain't never be tooken
And you can suck my banana but I won't eat your puddin
So come a lil closer my bros wanna know ya
H-andele, h-andele, h-andele (h-andele, h-andele, h-andele)
How the fuck a nigga think he gone survive with a YSL run with (how fool)
That vest is a mess from the blood out your chest
And I control your hoe like Net-, and -Flix
Yo' bitch at my dinner she wet like a fish
I took off all three legs, T-Rex

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel just like...</pre>
