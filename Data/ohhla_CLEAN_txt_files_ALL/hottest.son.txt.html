[Intro]
I gotta question for the streets, Who hotter than me?

[Hook x4]
Hottest In The City (x3)
Ain't Nobody Gon' Top Me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, The hottest in the city
City Squad be the team, got the hottest niggaz with me
Detroit City, get rolled on or roll with me
Tote semi's like Yosemitie Sam that hold fifty
Fuck with me, Lil' Sonny, I'm the hottest in the streets
Don't believe me ask around, I'm the hottest in the "D"
but, Back to the mixtapes, to get it poppin' over beats
Niggaz think I'm with the Clipse the way I'm Grindin' in these streets
Yeah, yeah, we flaming 'em, got the whole block hot
On the ave, hand to hand pitchin', yeah my block pop
How you balling, calling times on the shot clock?
Three sixty-five grind, all day, no stop watch
All about them dollar signs, I'm just watchin' money come
Jesse Owens on the track, always on that money run
Always talking money, son, so that's what my grinds about
I put it on my mama I'm the hottest out
You know that I'm the...

[Verse 2]
Niggaz saying Sonny ain't hot? Dog you niggaz lying, fam
I'm hotter than a crib in the 'jects that's on fire, fam
and my block doing numbers like The Wire, fam
I'm ending alot of rappers careers, I'm on fire, man
Alot of niggaz thinkin' they hot and I don't like the shit
I'm putting all you rappers in check, I'm on my Nike shit
You only hate 'cause you mad and want to fight me bitch
Until I'm coming out with them bangers, and start lightin' shit
Yeah, I get it poppin' like O-Dog
All the girls want me, they like "Sonny, you a show off"
It's getting kinda hot in here? Well gon' take them clothes off
The school of hard knocks I'm about to show y'all (told y'all)
I started off as a youngin' while y'all niggaz was sleepin'
On the block coney island style eating
Late nights on the ave, we was trillion dollar dreaming
Now a youngin' gettin' change holla at me for a feature
Nigga, I'm the...

[Verse 3]
I heard niggaz tryna to diss me saying I should be afraid, of what?
With all my goons we masked down, and tinted up
Think home brave? Nah, homie afraid, he scared as fuck
That forty raised, Now shorty brains? I tear 'em up
I air it out, fuck what they hearing 'bout
I'm the youngin' that's been running the streets you fearing 'bout
My wearabouts? any street, any block, any hood
My niggaz Deezy, Roc, Shorty Wop, What's really good?
Life's like a movie so I paint a big picture
I'm saying 'Hi haters', yeah I'm hearing y'all whisper
Ever since them niggaz gave me the Juice like Bishop
Nigga I been eating good, real shit, no dentures
Everybody think they the hottest out they fuckin' up doe
I'm sick of all these lame ass niggaz I've had enough yo
The realest nigga to spit it, I'm coming up yo
This coming from the hottest in the city, What up doe?
