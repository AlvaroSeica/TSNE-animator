[Syd Tha Kid]
We can conquer the world
Just you and me, no one else
Tell me if that's cool
What'chu wanna do? Ahh ooo-ooh

[Chorus]
Guns drawn in an all black car
Bustin out all the lanes, who got somethin to say about us?
We can rob this world blind, and maybe next time
they'll think twice before they try fuckin with us

[Interlude]
Just imagine what it'd be like be like
If you and me ruled everything
What would it be? What would it be?
Can you imagine what it'd be like be like
If you and me ruled everything
What would it be? Or would it be cool?

[Syd Tha Kid]
If we would conquer the world
Would you be down to roll with me
Like Bonny and Clyde
'Til the end of time

[Chorus] + [Interlude]</pre>
