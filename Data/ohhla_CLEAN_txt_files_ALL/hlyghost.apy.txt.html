[Intro]
Ha ha ha, YEAH! (Yeah yeah yeah)
Check one two (Uhh yo Slaine man)
Holy smokes (Apathy)
Nah fuck these motherfuckers man

[Apathy]
I'm the captain of the ship like Scotty beam me up
Bullies hated me in school but they could never beat me up
Fightin Irish like I'm Notre Dame, no one even knows your name
Catastrophic as atomic bombs leavin no remains
I live life through the eyes of kamikaze goggles
I'm Mike Tyson, you're Tyson the male model
Real metro; I'm macho as moshpits in Moscow
With Mossbergs turnin ice grills into soft serves
You better stay calm, display your palms say salaam
Before I snuff your mom and make her suck my lucky charms
I'm psychopathic on the mic you'll never touch me y'all
Cause as a child I used to cuddle with a Chucky doll
I swear to God these newer rappers better get a job
I keep 'em in Czech like losin passports in Prague
I got the death row flow, prepare the prisoner
Electrocute to execute the crew and scare the listener
Whip the stand I kicked in I'm cool as an air conditioner
Beat em until they eyes are as crooked as Forest Whitaker
Ap is gettin wickeder by the minute admit it
I'll finish ya; standin next to a monster y'all are miniature

[Chorus]
"Just when you thought it was safe to make records" {*4X*}
Holy Smokes! motherfuckerss I'm dope; make ya catch the Holy Ghost {*4X*}

[Interlude]
Police and troops have sealed off the country area
Haven't found the two men reported to have been running
away after the explosion (they spotted several men
running from the scene and fired at them - they missed)

[Slaine]
Holy smokes like Jesus blessed my Kools
Like I was in Catholic school gettin arrested for tools
I make a, mess of these fools turn 'em to vegetables
Turn 'em determined to be as stupid as the rest of yous
Got bitches blowin me suckin my testicles
F the rules, fuck the game and your necklace jewels
Tuck your chain you in the club with the ecstasy chewed
There's a price on my head, you don't wanna be next to me dude
Isn't it true, isn't it smart, drinkin brews, winter is dark
I enter the placenta with venom to chop
Unsentimental I'm mental shootin enemies hot from bullets
As soon as he goes there he went in the park - look at me
A crook and he's crookedly playin chess
You rookies are playin checkers at best so you pawns that tried rookin me
are playin the dirty Dorito eatin the ookie cookie
Lookie lookie at these faggot-ass pussies are all shook of me
I'm back up in this bitch to reclaim what was took from me
Came up in this game to be everything you couldn't be
Walk crookedly drunk, with a humongous toaster
I'm immediate like a meteorite that keeps comin closer

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Our strategy is, not known
The effective, use of, guerilla warfare
We will eventually sap the political will of the government
{*police siren fades*}</pre>
