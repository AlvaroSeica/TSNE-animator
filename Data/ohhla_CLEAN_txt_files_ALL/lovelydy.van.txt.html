Wassup, my people!
I am your weatherman, Busta Rhymes
I've come today give you your weather forecast
Y'know today looks like one of those beautiful days, y'know
To be perfectly honest...there ain't a cloud in a sky
Y'know this a kind of weather where you take your girl to the beach..
Lay down and talk to her..
Luther, step to the microphone

[Luther Vandross]
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something strange without a warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
And the world is all right with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be..

[Chorus 4X]
A Lovely Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy (Lovely Day, Lovely Day, Lovely Day)

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When somebody else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world is all right with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be..

[Chorus 4X]
A Lovely Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy (Lovely Day, Lovely Day, Lovely Day)

[Bridge]
It's gonna be a Lovely Day (it's gonna be...)
It's gonna be today!
It's gonna be a Lovely day
Today I love the world and I love you

[Busta Rhymes]
Let's take a ride baby and park under a lamppost
Recline a seat, relax, and let's listen to Mr. Vandross
And watching how my mami watching her dude
Creating a situation that put us right in the mood
(I'm sayin') I got plenty suggestion on what that we could maybe do
Especially when we're rocking the songs we make babies to
You know the way we do, baby, and as we lay
I look at you and sit back and think how today was such a Lovely Day

(Chorus and Bridges until fade)</pre>
