[Intro]
mc chris is dead and he ain't never comin back
You should have been nicer when he was blazin up the track
No well wishers, just bitches talkin trash,
Cause the aftermath is saying that rap is wack (mc chris is dead!)

[mc chris]
On arrival, watch his rivals revel the jealous
relish the moment their opponent went sublevel
Six feet under, what a bummer, it's no wonder the waste
Could have been a contender, now maggots march on his face
Emcees often in his coffin, lyin down, lost in thought
Groupies gather at the grave and done throw posies on the pot
Haters hate off in the distance, telescoping with binoc's
Smoking basket after laughin, get their knickers in knots
They play, in the park, in the dark, where they spark a spliff
Raise it high in the sky and cry "This hit is for Chris"
Then they tell a tale of how he really was a pimp
Hands wanted to be on, just want to be on his dick

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'll wait to the day's end when the moon is high
And then I'll rise with the tide with a lust for life, I'll
Amass an army, and we'll harness a horde
And then we'll limp across the land until we stand at the shore

[mc chris]
mc chris is dead, and it's dreadfully morbid
He forfeits, forever free for the poor kids
Once filled to the bonnet with demonic endorphins
All his power rings restrained, no more Mighty Morphin'
We couldn't close the lid there'll be no bids on his toys
No will for the rumor mill no bills to enjoy
He kept every penny 'cept the two on his eyes
Now the diggers at Denny's, gettin cheese on his fries
As for the babies and their mommas there'll be drama for days
Looks like he's got his likeness now it's time to get paid
So many starvin Marvin guardin claimin mc's seed
But he's a seedless greed, makin pace in the R.I.P.
It's a crock in the pot that's fraught of it be the mock death
He's got the awesomest posthumous box set
They're airbrushing MC on plain white tee's
Another life lost to violence, silence if you please

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
My name is mc chris and yo I can't get laid
Now they lay me to rest, how'm I gonna get paid?
These quarters are cramped and I'm crazy claustrophobic
Consider it noted, I feel belittled and bloated
I better bust out in a hurry cause I ain't hatin the road then
I can barely bust a move because my body is broken
But I'm covered in collections though you can't take it with you
Someone pass me a tissue while they gnash on my tissue
Somebody prayed to Vishnu, any deity will do
I claw at my satin ceiling, I've got nothin to lose
And through the dirt and the thick mud, I'll tunnel like Dig-Dug
Or the underminer, my desire is the big buck
Can I convey the basement without wasting my words
Fossilization's what I'm facin unless defacement occurs
So I rise to the occasion, there's no waitin for worms
And please no zombie player haters man what have we learned?
...
