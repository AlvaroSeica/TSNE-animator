[Intro: sample from "Without Hope You Can Not Start The Day" by Yes]
It's coming clear I've noticed, it's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back..."
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it - tell me why...
Only you can tell it.. only you can say...
Only you can tell it...
Only you can say...
Only you can tell it...
Tell me why...

[Pusha T]
Two sides, what the game'll do, bring money, fame to you
Stackin' mine, nigga ye high, standin' on it like a pedestal
Couldn't imagine a better view from the poolhouse you see four cars
Bad bitches, they skinny dippin', mixed college bitches with porn stars
Disconnected my OnStar, no GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, went ocular, that's CBS
Aston Martin, DBS, James Bond cool as James Todd
Best nigga to make hits and run base since A-Rod
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon
{Only you can tell it} My Diors is distressed, CDG vest with Jays on
Bloggers get your trace on, 500 horses race on
{Only you can say...} Coke ties, that coke dries, it's cemented, it's baked on
Eghck! {Only you can tell it...} That's based on, the life of a nigga who ain't said nothin'
Trunk tight, trunk white, can't relate if you ain't bled nothin'
{Tell me why...} Now that there said somethin', don't make me have to dead nothin'
You askin' me to tell you why you niggas never had nothin'

[Chorus: sample from "Without Hope You Can Not Start The Day" by Yes]
It's coming clear I've noticed, it's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back..."
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it - tell me why...
Only you can tell it...
Only you can say...
Only you can tell it...
Tell me why...

[Wale]
Somethin' y'all wouldn't understand
Check, look, get it..

Folarin back, the hardest out I put us on the map
My eyes low, I keep 5 rolled so my THC be makin' sound effects
We ain't hatin', cause we ain't y'all, too much Ciroc we CB4
62, black on black, see my vehicle is like MEAC ball
Woo! Shoutout to Norfolk, kicks from Portland, my hoes from Portsmouth
Ha, y'all nick and dime, if a brick was 'round you might need a forklift
Can't fuck with us cause me and my niggas ride
That's right, what up Pusha T, it's DMV for life
{Only you can tell it...} Giuseppe Zanotti, I beg your pardon, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Three something for an after party and Balenciaga, I filled Arenas twice
{Only you can say it...} Tell these motherfuckers get me doe (get me doe)
Iceberg Shorty, mu' fuck your Disney store (Disney sto')
{Only you can tell it...} And remove your words, G double O-D, MMG we good
Got Zamunda furs, don't know how Akeem, but Pusha's semi cold
{Tell my why...} My nigga Geezy out in VA, I hope you hear these flows
Behind these walls, still in our thoughts, the city know
Let's go...

[Chorus]</pre>
