[J. Sands]
Ayo the world ain't nothing new, just analyze the world
Cuz brothers getting wet up from the streets to the curb
I saw a preacher man smoke an herb on 23rd
That's my word from NYC to Pittsburg
We connect, one two live up in effect
On the set, Lone Catalysts, and you can bet
The moon shine devine, line for line
Then intertwine with mine this time and you will find
The illest operation ever known to mankind
The mind is a shrine, mentally we decline
And reach an elevation that'll sway the population
Cuz they;ve been waiting, so later for the conversation
It's time for motivation, shit, you've got the information
It's bumping through your speaker when you make the observation
My process of elimination, understand the world is what we're facing
Frontlines to the frontsteps of corporations
This is my application to the occupation to drop science on the nation like

[Chorus 2X: J. Sands &amp; Makeba Mooncycle]
Now would you want to take me if I take you
You know the world is nothing new, let me guide you through
J. Sands and Makeba have a ride for you
Food for thought, we'll provide for you

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Watch me spread my wings, flying high like a dove
With a touch from above, fitting perfect like a glove
One love to my peoples, after this, another sequel
A Lone Catalyst gliding my way
So I jumped on like a sun ray
I see peace for this day as we make the tide sway
As I commence to spray with the hopes of better days
Change is all good, take the old boards out the hood
Come to life, a sheep disguised in wolfs clothes
Leave the multitudes, three fish, five blows
You act like you know, catching feelings from your head to your toes
Foundation never change, I just keep living, thinking of a new beginning
Our minds are in synch which cause us to think
My mind made a smog like fire in the dark
Despite the events, no time to convince
If we're changing minds I'll flow with the times
If some don't realize, try not to despise
Thanks for picking me up for this ride
A-Alikes coencide when we when we turn a reprise
Reflect the mic's eye, reflect the mic's eye
You reflect the mic's eye

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
