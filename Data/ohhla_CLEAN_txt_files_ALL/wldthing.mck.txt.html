[Intro: Mack Wilds]
Yo! You ready?

[Verse One: Mack Wilds]
So we ball and pop champagne and waste it 
See I never been a drinker but a nigga taste it
But I'm fine, fly guy dressed to take shit
And these ladies wanna be taken
In my mind, all I see is dollars and laced whips
This bad chick just started wavin
The crowd parted as I made my way
I said hey lil' mama come look for a date
She said, excuse me cutie I'm in love with your ways
The more you come around the more I want just a day
The way you look you got me wantin to play
Where are you from so tell me where do you stay?

[Chorus: Mack Wilds] (Method Man)
In the land of the wild things (Ah! You see them killers from the slums)
(If they feelin froggish leap, then kill 'em from the jump it's the) 
Wild things (You see the shotty with the pump?!)
(The black Maserati with the body in the trunk)
In the land of the wild things (Then nothin better count that twice)
(Go on lil' money you ain't 'bout that life it's the)
Wild Things (You know we gotta style on 'em right)
(My wolves on the full moon we wild for the night)

[Verse Two: Mack Wilds]
Come along I'll tell you a story of greatness
A young nigga warned being saved
From the time when niggas'll frown on 'em hatin
By the clown of pussy niggas scared to say shit
All the while, the kids sat around and waited
Writin rhymes singin every takes
Couple niggas thought he never made it
I guess them hatin ass niggas never knew her face
She said, excuse me cutie oh I do want to say
Your soundin like the kind of guy that I need a day
The way your talkin got me wantin to play
Where are you from now tell me where do you stay?!

[Chorus: Mack Wilds] (Method Man)
In the land of the wild things (Ah! You see them killers from the slums)
(If they feelin froggish leap, then kill 'em from the jump it's the) 
Wild things (You see the shotty with the pump?!)
(The black Maserati with the body in the trunk)
In the land of the wild things (Then nothin better count that twice)
(Go on lil' money you ain't 'bout that life it's the)
Wild Things (You know we gotta style on 'em right)
(My wolves on the full moon we wild for the night)

[Verse Three: Mack Wilds]
I come from the crime side the New York Times side
S.I. 'til I D-I-E
I grew up hearin that Wu knock, watchin them guns cock back
Jet black you feel like Hercules
Hercules! Hercules! Get a hand clap
Damn that! They be got me covered like Saran Wrap
My whole hood jumpin now guess I did that
While these ladies wanna cover on my ball sack
Light skin brother, smooth like butter
Comin from the city with most plots 
With summer in the hood we believed there was no need for change
'Cause we believe the change and got shit for brain
But I came to +Bring The Pain+ one in a half against the grain
Pop shot poppin all he needs one day
The child is back again! OWWWWWWWW!!!!!!

[Chorus: Mack Wilds] (Method Man)
In the land of the wild things (Ah! You see them killers from the slums)
(If they feelin froggish leap, then kill 'em from the jump it's the) 
Wild things (You see the shotty with the pump?!)
(The black Maserati with the body in the trunk)
In the land of the wild things (Then nothin better count that twice)
(Go on lil' money you ain't 'bout that life it's the)
Wild Things (You know we gotta style on 'em right)
(My wolves on the full moon we wild for the night)

[Outro: Method Man] (Mack Wilds)
Welcome to Staten fuckin Island scrappy!
This the bottom, the dirt the ratchet shit!
Ain't nothin but goons out here fuck boy!
Now is you a wolf or is you a sheep (In the land of the wild things)
I got your ghetto metrocard right here nigga if you wanna ride
Stapleton the wild west! Homicide housing New Brighton, Arlington, The Harbor
You know who you fuckin with?!
