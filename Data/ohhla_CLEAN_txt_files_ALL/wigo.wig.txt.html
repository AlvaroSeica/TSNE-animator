[Shawn Wigs]
Aiyo it's Wigo, I drop like a brick in the third
Major money, I ain't spending on no beats from nerds
Copping two chrome summers, a sample from Donna Summers
So rocks for my wiz, the size of cucumbers
Fuck an advance, I'm still gon' have to recoup
Keep the front money, I'm going for the long term loot
I'm staying alive, experienced enough to survive
So my grandkids kids can vibe to blow money</pre>
