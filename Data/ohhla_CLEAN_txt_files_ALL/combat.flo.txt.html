[Intro]
No known beat that can keep me lonely {*8X*}
...
No known beat that can keep me lonely {*2X*}

[repeat 8X with "No known beat that can keep me lonely" in background]
Com-bat, to get you to bomb back

[Verse One]
I know how to rip a mic different, I grip it like so
Tight like a kryptonite with a bike pole
Sparks from my lips ignite liquid nitro
No tellin if it might blow
The environments' gotta be hotter than solder inside the iron
Zinc vitamins hide' em inside when I'm writin the rhymes
It's hard to keep property guarded because of these pirates
And I motivate, no debate
We're takin it over make, no mistake
You're fake and there's no escape cause you got, caught
Frozen waitin for the cross-walk
I can take it to another level
Where the bass is above the treble
And you're facin double evasiveness doesn't settle it
A place and a space where there's nothin to meddle with

Com-bat, to get you to bomb back {*4X*}

[Verse Two]
Lyrical com-bat, to get you to bomb back
Blonde, black, let's get beyond that
Sing songs that attack with strong raps
3-2-1, contact~!
Sans, paddle we swim the long laps
Swans, flap to get the pond packed
Want, sass kiss my moms ass
Wrong, tact convict you en masse
Take it back like Linda Ronstadt
Or Luke Sky, with a twisted long hat
Ton ton fat, subsistin on that
Tom tom, high-hat
Insist upon that, listenin to Jon rap
This is combat to get you to bomb back
Two-fisted contact to get the pond packed
Cause I'm on some {shit} that exists beyond that
...
3-2-1</pre>
