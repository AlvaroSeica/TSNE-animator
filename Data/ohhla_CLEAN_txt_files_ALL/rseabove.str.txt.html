[Intro: Christbearer]
Yeah... Christbearer... Christbearer...
Christ... Christ... Christbearer, yeah..
Yeah... Christbearer, what, who? Christbearer
Yeah, yeah, what, yeah, yeah

[Christbearer]
The only addict that is in control
A Charlie Parker count, Basy Duke and Jellyroll
A do or die, or by the higher height flyer
Cuz when I flow I set the fucking world on fire
Me or the devil gon' get ya
If you the true believer in the scripture on this oblong twister
We get all evil in the picture
Scaring the bejesus outta victim, with the famous hanus mixture
Who wanna challenge big Christ to a fight
Be the lonely only one on a three dog night
The niggas that could tell you how you feel
I tell ya'll what's the muthafucking drill while I'm banging with a kill
I be the bomb, people know me on a song
The Black Godfather, Don Vito Corleone
Doing the craziest shit, fresh out the liquor store
A million dollar million off a twenty dollar poor
Yo, I made something outta nothing
Then heard a beat this one got noticed as if my name was David Ruffin
To hang heavy off a beat that you rock
Drop my Chevy to the levy, when the levy was dropped
Splashed the past tease that release the fire
And my canibus sativa got the Queen of Cheeba high
Sigh, everybody got a crush on that bitch
Got plush, then put a little rush on that bitch
I went AWOL, conquering the mall like bitch
I taught Simon and Peter bout the Paul
Christbearer be a world premiere
Smoking mumbles in the leer, in the racketeer gear
The only man satan in the fresh here
Cuz I made 'em one 'em up and get the fuck up outta here

[Chorus 2X: Christbearer]
When we, are able, to see, beyond the effect to the cause
That produce the effect, then we are able to see correct
Then no longer our decisions be emotional decisions
They are made rational with percision, rise above emotions

[Meko the Pharaoh]
It's straight danger in the street, and I got heat
To beat niggas that make you talk sweet
I stay focused while the world's wide open
And I rise above emotions, cuz the God's not joking
Northstar, baby, put ya hands up
And if you feeling me then put ya hands up
Cuz everybody needs something to feel
I rotate the planet and spit the real
Ya'll niggas better put up ya force field
Before you get killed, or the devil tried to kill
This is people coming straight from the Beach
To ignite the weak, and lace the streets
Cuz everybody can go a little crazy
But crazy can get you killed in the long run
Especially for my niggas that be on one
It's Northstar til they blow the horn, son
Yeah, yeah, Northstar, til they blow the horn, son

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 4X: Tone Bone]
When we, are able to see, beyond negativity
Rise above emotions...</pre>
