[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Uhh, I think it's only right 
that we hit 'em with some H-Town +Ammunition+ {*gun cocks*}
Chamillionaire, Doughbeezy, Marcus Manchild {*semi-automatic gunshots*}
They say we ain't got it like that, so you know what?
LET'S GET IT! {*BLAM*}

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
Just give me two homes in different locations
Just make one a little mo' spacious
And two Roleys dipped in gold faces
And two girls that's known to switch places
Ready let's get that... let's get that, let's go
Let me know if you with that... you with that? Let's go!
Just give me two yellow bones with cute faces
Gotta be bad, can never be basic
TV screens is lookin like "Matrix"
Car so fast the police can't chase it
Ready let's get that... let's get that, let's go
Let me know if you with that... you with that? Let's go!
We can get it now

[Chamillionaire]
Let's go, got tired of waitin, got tired of hopin
Now my chain's so icey you can ride the slope and
Now extended swingers stay ridin pokin
And the paint's so wet I'm feelin like I'm floatin
You can mention them but they are not as dope and
somebody lied or somebody jokin
They tellin y'all that they got it locked
Well tell 'em that we 'bout to come and pry it open (wooo!)
And then they all can have it, none of y'all can have it
She takin off her shirt, want me to autograph it
So I autograph it, let me autograph it
Your woman disappearin, you could call it magic
See it's automatic cause it's all established
I'm the Texas rapper that you know is far from average
I'm the rapper that these other rappers call the baddest
Been the baddest since the day I went and bought a Tablet
Get a chick and then another chick'll come in the mail (mail)
Your woman beggin me to come and rub on her tail
I never cared about a cover of a XXL
Then every record I'ma get a bigger tuck in my sales
I'm the boss yo' boss should get pissed at
I'ma take it all, my weapon go click-clack
See I want it all and that should be gift wrapped
Enough with the talk in Texas, let's get that!

[Chorus]

[Doughbeezy]
Doughbeezy! Huh!

Let's G-O, get it!
My grind got me blind on C-note niggaz
It's the colored chandeliers or it's the Southeast beast
So we leavin boys pissed like a P.O. visit (OOWW!)
Your money like a midget, mine tall like a giant
I used to get mad cause I couldn't get fly
Now when I say I'm fly I really mean that I'm fly
Couldn't pay my light bill, now show's over liiiine
Yeah, if you with it, I'm with it
I'm down to go get it this minute, right now
I don't care who did it or done it, I need it
I want it, fuck next, I'm the nigga right now
I'm comin up quick, got 'em lookin like "How?"
But I'm lookin right back like, "Nigga fuck you!"
I dropped my mixtape and the next day
did a song with a nigga I look up to (LET'S GO!)
Screams droppin like panty-hose
Givin niggaz toothaches from the candy do's
Even in 2020 my rims still gon' be from 1984 (yeah)
That's the Texas tank and I'm the Texas Chain-
-saw, I murder beast, no paces
Fuck bein local, I want the whole nation
So when I sign my deal, I'ma tell the label
Doughbeezy, yeah

[Chorus]

[Marcus Manchild]
Let's get that, let's get that
Chamillionaire what up homie? Yeah!

Okay, we can get it now
Hop on a record then I'm flippin out
I want every bitch to approach me with they motherfuckin titties out
because a nigga wanna feel 'em out, that's how I'm dealin out
I wanna know what two cribs about
But never take 'em to the biggest house
I pull up at the garage in the car, the top back gettin dome
Vroom-vroom! And I'm peeling out - like "What you know about it?"
What? I'm sippin purple (purple)
Wanna get richer off of the work flow (work flow)
And I speed it up like Turbo (geah!)
Got up in the game, fell in love with some Virgos
Two friends beside, you know I'm finna hit 'em (hit 'em)
Pull 'em to the side, yeah you know I'm finna get 'em
Cause I'm all about my spinners much as I'm 'bout my mozzarelli
Much as me and they wanna be a part of that livin dead!
Want them to bow to me because I'm space God
With a pocket full of bank cards
like I play cards, I got a day off
And they tell me a nigga finna take off
Tell the labels that I'm with THAT (with THAT)
With the car I like I fit THAT (fit THAT)
Cut the check muh'fucker, let's GET THAT!
Boy~!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Chamillionaire]
You know these clowns won't be able to keep H-Town down
Somebody better let 'em KNOW
Die slow {*BLAM*}
