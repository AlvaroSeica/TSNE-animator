[Intro: Live Squad]
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
yeah, get bust get busy, yeah
Squad for 93, niggas dont know how we do
better check this shit
yeah, uhh, uhh, uhh (ya dont stop)
in the house yall
the motherfuckin motherfuckin house

[Verse 1: Majesty]
I'm using crazy force, boy Im bruising
When I spot the enemy, you KNOW his life he's losin'
Domes getting wrecked, breakin necks, then I jet
When I come through I break em off, never took a loss yet
Listen, I'm steady illing pissing on the enemies
Spreading blood on the walls, making sure they 'fraid of me
It'll be a murder, tell your boy word up
Comin from a lethal weapon, showin I don't give a fuck
Kill em up, break em down show em I don't mess around
Have em all petrified of the loud gun sound
Spittin like a gatalin, shells dropping rattling
Duckin and bustin, under pressure gun battling
But I got the skills to kill, I get ill
And when I get high it can really be a thrill
Bullets I toss fuck a boss
I took one before, never again will I take a loss
Droppen em to the down low, cold coppin em
Guns spittin out teflons kid, nothing stoppen em
Chopping them up, with the knuckle game, giving pain
Bodies slain when I come like rain
Splittin em all, I cant take a fall
You wanna shoot we can sheet, wanna brawl we can brawl
Nigga, that's how we roll!

[Majesty bridge]
Yeah, Squad in the motherfuckin house know what im sayin'
(thats how the squad roll)
yeah, check it out now, bring it on now
Big Stretch now, show em how the fuck we come thru, know what im sayin?

[Verse 2: Stretch]
Like Big Maj said, we let off lead
And cause a fucking massacre, make a move kid were after ya
With no remorse another body tossed into the river
Told ya def lines I deliver
Cold shiver, relax, and max, easy, I'm human
Just hope the scope don't ever gotta zoom in
Paying off cops with rocks, cuz im a smokin'
Hopin that I don't ever send a sucker knowin
Showing who needs to be quiet,
And if you try to frame me there'll be a fuckin riot
I'm bringin the noise, along with boys, scritly hard
You cant stop the drama cuz my whole damn mobs here
Bullet proof vest cant save ya from the danger
AK 47 practice on the ranger
Aiming at ya dome with a chrome desert eagle
Bustin at the police like that shit is legal
If they wanna harm me they better bring an army
Cuz im dropping bombs like im mad cuz a don g
That's how we do!
That's how we roll niggas

[Outro: Live Squad]
Queens in the motherfuckin house
Springfield Mob, check that rugged raw shit yo
That's how we roll, squads in the motherfuckin house
Yeah, queens in the motherfuckin house
Uptown, Brooklyn, boogiedown, long island, motherfuckin new jersey
Niggas comin through, know what im sayin
Yo Low, just let em feel the funk know what im sayin
Uhh 93 style, 93 style, 93 style (yeah)
93 style (yeah), that's how we come through, the 93 style (yeah)

(Yeah repeating in background)
("that's how the squad roll" repeating in background)</pre>
