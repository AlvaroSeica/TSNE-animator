[Intro: P.R. Terrorist]
Yo, Tera Iz Him, the muthafuckin' joint
This is not the album, it's a bunch of exclusive tracks
From the muthafuckin' Terrorist, himself
Man, I'd like to peace to all my niggas for supporting me and shit
One love, and all my producers that fuckin' back with the music, knowhatimean?
4th Disciple, Mathematics, Danja Mental, F. Price
Ason from Philly, ya'll niggas know what time it is
One love, man, niggas got the illest beats, in the world, man
Knahimean? This is not the muthafuckin' album, Domination is the album
For those who don't know, Tera Iz Him is just like a preparation of the album
I'm bout to let ya niggas know how I'm about to come
But check it out, right quick, I'm bout to spit a freestyle for all my real niggas
One love to Wu-Tang, Killarmy, ya'll my muthafucking brothers, man, from the heart
All over the world with them niggas, check it out, yo

[P.R. Terrorist]
Whether raps or capsules, weed spots or gats pointed at you
Getting paper for me's an all natural
In fact you, take notes, these lyrics they end quotes
The shit that I spit, comes straight out my throat
Niggas record what I'm breathing, jakes be acting like there's a reward for my freedom
Are you obversving or seeing, they say seeing is believing, but looks can be deceiving
You can paint the pretty picture, and the picture'll have no meaning
So they call it abstract, but the frame is a shame to hold it
So they hang it on the wall, and the wall folded
Weak minds are molded, by these devils, now they corroded
Played a positive picture in his head, and his brain exploded
Keep my guns loaded, with a, extra clip
Cuz nowadays in these streets, niggas be extra slick
Some be talking out they mouth, some of them'll get you hit
But they know better to fuck with this Terrorist shit
I shoot randomly, used to get my hands dirty
Now I got some young guns that love to handle it for me
But if I want it done right, I gotta do it myself
So I handle it personally, although it bads for my health
Fuck off, nigga, Tera Iz Him</pre>
