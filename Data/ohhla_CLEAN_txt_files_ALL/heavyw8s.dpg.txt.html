[Chorus] - X 2
Yeah, we can set it straight
Dogg Pound Gangstas nigga, yeah we heavyweights
You got beef, we could set a date
Nigga don't hesitate
Fuckin' with you featherweights

[Daz Dillinger]
Let's get ready to rumble
I'm Spud Webb of the game and I'm smackin' down Mutombo
Homie you don't want no - problems with this heavyweight
Shut it down homeboy, yeah like every state
Act bold, talk shit, nigga get K'd away

[Snoop Dogg]
We so slick with this criminal shit
Winner with this, hard on a bitch
My fundamentals is swift
It's confidential, our momentum make us ball like a fifth
Little hoe got stopped at the door with the fifth
But we ain't trip, we still slip and slide and ride by high

[Kurupt]
No regard to a busta like you
On the streets, on the yard, smash a busta like you
I'ma - peel your paint and slap your bitch
I'ma - push the line and ride and chip
Osama... I'm fiction and fact
And I'll beat the shit outta you and your batch

[Daz Dillinger]
Nigga... you know Tha Pound pull triggers
Bitch wanted king size, I give her this nigga
Let her hit the weed then down that liquor
Roll 'em like bats when I smoke that Swisher

[Chorus] - X 2
Yeah, we can set it straight
Dogg Pound Gangstas nigga, yeah we heavyweights
You got beef, we could set a date
Nigga don't hesitate
Fuckin' with you featherweights

[Kurupt]
Yeah... if you ain't pushin'
get the fuck out the motherfuckin' circle, pussy
Pussy whipped, done lost your grip
Fuckin' round with the bitch that used to fuck with Lil' Chris
I'll make bitches twist like licorice
Gobble on a dick and watch the G's dip down the strip

[Daz Dillinger]
Gotta expect to catch a hot one in a second
G'd up because I'm feddish, G'd up because I'm breadish
Cause bullshit niggaz is bad for your health
And ask them niggaz, yeah how did it felt
When we had to take the AK right off the shelf

[Snoop Dogg]
I'll put a hole in these bitch boys, real shit boys
Cause we - deep-deep, deep
Motherfuckers know the recipe
Nigga quit stressin' me
Before you be restin' in peace
On the West we OK Corral
Real talk nigga that's how it go down

[Chorus] - X 2
Yeah, we can set it straight
Dogg Pound Gangstas nigga, yeah we heavyweights
You got beef, we could set a date
Nigga don't hesitate
Fuckin' with you featherweights</pre>
