[Ice-T]
Oh! yeaaah, ha ha ha ha, I'm back motherfucker!
Ice-T; nineteen ninety one, fool ~
Ha ha ha ha, I told you; you should've killed me last year

Once again, I'm back in the place to be
The I, the C, the E, the T
I'll never get a Grammy, so FUCK the G
All I need is crowd, and my M-I-C
Got a gangster ass DJ named Evil-E
My record label's called Warner B.
William Morris is my agency
I'll never go broke, I got property
Got a dope Pit Bull named Felony
Got four gold albums, so what you telling me?
Power was two, Iceberg was three
This one here shipped five hundred G
Now when I roll, I roll stupid deep
Benzs, Bemers, and booming Jeeps
I'm always strapped cause my money I keep
You move on the Ice and you're going to sleep
So when you see me walking down the street
You say: "What's up Ice?" I say: "Peace!"
You give me a Dap, I give you one back
Cause I ain't souped so forget about that
We might take a picture or sign an autograph
Kick a little flavor, have some fun and laugh
But step to me wrong, you might get shot
And wind up looking out a ziplock!!!</pre>
