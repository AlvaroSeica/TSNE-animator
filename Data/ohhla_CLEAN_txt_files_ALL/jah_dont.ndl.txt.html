Verse 1
Supply the infinite pain inside my DNA was imprinted; intrinsic
Where we live money's the incentive
Desensitizing and depriving us of all feelings
Trained to manipulate brains just to make a living
Drugs and the sex business where they trade women
Make them do the most heinous things for the green spinach
Diet pills in the system absorbed to make them thinner
For the consumer to react and then they take their winnings
Throwing subliminal images for the subconscious
Through the suffering, pain, and the hate only the love conquers
Corrupt doctrines; blood mixed with vodka
Luxury entrepreneurs, highest bidders in this love auction
When the clubs poppin'- Patrone spilling
Vicariously living your life through your own children
The soul's eternal, repulsive acts of desperation
But the external shell comes with a date of expiration

*And when that day comes can't have it back
It's gone for good*

 Chorus Â– Sam Suave
Trying to live my life, but everything's going wrong/ it's so hard
Trying to keep my head up/ but nothing is going right/ it's so hard
So hard/ so hard/ so hard/ it's so hard
Tired of hustling tired of struggling/ it's so hard

Verse 2
Soliloquies to vilify me through these iniquities
Poverties and inequalities- Piff
Epiphanies in my chemistry
Devilish imagery hemorrhaging through my chi- Glee
Despair in my atmosphere affects my energy
Comprehensive jealously inside of hearts of enemies
Battles of Machiavelli born to be a master killer
Matters of massive massacres and sado- masochism
Defy the laws of physics with positive optimism
Attraction of the polar opposites comes through these Godly visions
Your soul is obviously missing, you lost a costly mission
Cooking raw information in Babylon's kitchen
Battle on the children's mind since the abolition
Catalysts for capitalism divided through religion
Using euphemisms the cancer went through remission
Eulogy for the youth to listen but the truth is missing

Verse 3
Violence makes sense for the dollars and cents
Knowledge is sent through my halogen sense
Silicone and collagen inside lips
Dropping them hips
Wobbling and frolicking in front of my eye lids
Bigger fried fish mystify this
is why we live to die rich; would even lie to get this
Wide lens for my third eye's iris
Alchemist bliss still I can live blind and I can miss all this
Alcoholic in the office with a narcoleptic mind
So blind facing the truth that they cannot accept it
Shock treatment and lobotomy
Nobody better bother me, don't lie to me
That's colonic psychology
Hypocrisy and false democracy they on to me
Wanting me to sell my soul and then they honor me
The world economy designed to feed a small percentage
We all connected its all written in your genetics

*We all in this together- we smile together we cry together*</pre>
