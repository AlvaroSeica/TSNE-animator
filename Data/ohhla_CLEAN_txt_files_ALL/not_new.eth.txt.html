[Chorus]
This is just some things on my mind
A place I've come to that's hard to define
But I would like to invite you
To take a break and experience what you might do
If, once in a while, we looked eye to eye
Neither of us spoke, but we both tried
To stare past the looking glass surface
And educate our self through another person

[Verse 1]
This is my life, you've heard it all before
This is what's right and don't do that anymore
Headaches originate from many directions
The righteous congregate and parade their lessons
I can't take this all-for-one agenda
And I alone won't make this place any better
The reaction of he who loves
A surrounding environment through nothing that he does
I am he and I will be whatever you would like from me
Would you like to see what I've been around?
A face surrounded by faces in the crowd
Sad but real, what I feel to be true
Found through the people I was raised to abuse
Without reach I overlooked the inner search
And now I'm left nursing things that hurt
This never works (This never works)
What age is this when we humiliate the innocent?
Then cry for innocence loss
Rebellion that circulates around the cross
Takes time to pause
And on the very silence, holding this
Head high as I question my acceptance
I'll find acceptance Â– Auh forget it
Me giving advice has never really fitted
Just hard to explain but this song
Is hopefully something someone can build on

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Learn from my mistakes and steal my achievements
I really want to believe this person's decent
Full of diseases I sort them through
Filters I've developed by observing you
And I swear I can see these principalities
Attacking me right now and it arouses me
How my mind's battling, giving me some meaning
To blur the lines of reality and dreaming
And I'm weaving in and out of this mess
And I have yet to be honestly put to the test
I'm losing sign of what I was born to do
Eat, sleep, and breath but that's nothing new
Just something I forget when egos are involved
Something I accept while attempting to solve
My steadfast curiosity
And the fear that there's nobody out there watching me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Here I sit alone in this room
I'm moving with the current while looking to improve
Where I stand in this dwindling space
Where mortals are menacing
Reflections of things I wish to become
Serenity strikes while I wait for the drums
Leaving loved ones behind when I go
Holding memories and releasing what I know
About the patterns within which I chose
To grow up in as a novel approach
To mimicking individual opinions
The genuine king of a familiar dominion
And I'm using this as an excuse
For why I feel overwhelmingly confused
I watch you choose to follow me
Into the shadows of everything that we see</pre>
