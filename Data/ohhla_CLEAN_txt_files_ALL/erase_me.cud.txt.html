[Verse One] [Kid Cudi]
She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me
Anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me 
Hmmmmmm
A couple days no talkin' I seen my baby
And this what she tells me
She said

[Chorus]
I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works
I can't get away from you
No
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking
And nothing helps
I can't stop missing you
Yeah

[Verse Two] [Kid Cudi]
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete
Yeah
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete
Hmmm
A couple weeks no talking, I seen my baby
I've missed you so damn much
Hey
I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me
She said

[Chorus]
I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works
I can't get away from you
No
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking
And nothing helps
I can't stop missing you
Yeah

[Bridge]
Cause I'm in the magazines
On the TV
No matter where you are you might hear me
I'm in the magazines
On the TV
No matter where you go you might see me

[Verse Three] [Kanye West]
Hello, uh
I'm Yeezy
She said, "Hi I'm Aria."
No, you an angel you wave hi to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen ya befo', but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed up
Don C said she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinski on the dress she'll take ya to the cleaners
Sure enough a week later I'm in extra love
And everybody know she mine, so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a ender
She let it go to her head, no not my Aria
The height of her shopping was writer's blockin' me
I couldn't get me shit out anyway
I hope you die Aria/diarrhea

[Chorus]
I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works
I can't get away from you
No
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking
And nothing helps
I can't stop missing you
Yeah</pre>
