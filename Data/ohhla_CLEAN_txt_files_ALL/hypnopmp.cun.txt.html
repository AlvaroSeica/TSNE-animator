[Bianca Floyd]
Life, is but a dream
Once, two suns were born to mix
Goddess of Night, and Hypnos, God of Sleep
The eldest was Morpheus, who lived in the visions of dreamers
Rising to his calling, meant someone must abandon all other paths
for the prospect of greatness
Thus, heroes and kings called Morpheus, the destiny bringer
To accept his gift, required impossible risk
and loneliness in the midst of adoration
But to deny him - madness
Then, there was Phobotor, whom they called the dread crawler
For he dwelled only in nightmares
and fed on the acrid fumes of human fear
A shapeshifter, he appeared as the manifestation of terror
Forcing a choice between the path of uncertainty
and the path, of mediocrity
To meet Phobotor's gaze required great courage
To look away - shame
Only in the grey hour, in the moments of shadow and light
will the balance of power dangle
between the destiny bringer's favor
and the dread crawler's wrath
Only there, between waking and sleep
will we recognize, our true path</pre>
