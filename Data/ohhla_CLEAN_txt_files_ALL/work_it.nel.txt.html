Let's go oh

Baby Show Something
Don't say nothing (Don't you say a word)
I just want to
See you work it (Come on baby work it for me)
That ain't frontin
Show me something (Let me see it girl)
I just try to
See you work it (I just wanna see you work it for me)

[Verse One]
I heard her talking loud but she ain't saying nothing
What up with all the frontin come on and show me sumthin
You know you wanna do it, go ahead yo man ain't coming
Please do that thing when you dippin
Keep yo hips poppin, what's up with all these questions
And what planning baby
You talking to me like you talking to an adolescent
I like to - jump off, jump off
Clothes - come off, come off
Her place, freaky beats, and so and so on
Let your waist pop when the bass knock
I flood the watch to the top 'til it's no clock
Cant even tell the time, but you know it's mine
What time is it ma?  Its twenty karats after nine
Are you dehydrated? Well let me quench your thirst
First thing first, let's do what we rehearsed
Know dem numbers now, it show be break break it
Get up and take a stance and let me see ya

Baby Show Something
Don't say nothing (Don't you say a word)
I just want to
See you work it (Come on baby work it for me)
That ain't frontin
Show me something (Let me see it girl)
I just try to
See you work it (I just wanna see you work it for me)

[Verse Two]
She still talking loud but she ain't saying nothing
Why you ain't moving ma, DJ ain't playing nothing
You tell him to, play this heere until these speakers blow
Birthdays pick a place, baby we can go
I like yo adllics, she showing no back
She showing up attacks, you wouldn't know
It's like you ghetto ghetto, she bourghetto zhetto
She 5'5 brown eyes, in stiletto, letto (Baby) 
Well did you come alone, or you got 2 or 3
That ain't no thang baby girl cause I got 2 with me
And we gon' all kick it, and you about to see
Just what a day would be if you were in the ride with me
Turning on the headlights, and we be
Running all the red lights
Those fool steal my head, and ain't no stopping now
Now come on heere and drop cause he gon' tell why

Baby Show Something
Don't say nothing (Don't you say a word)
I just want to
See you work it (Come on baby work it for me)
That ain't frontin
Show me something (Let me see it girl)
I just try to
See you work it (I just wanna see you work it for me)

Now all my midwest shorties, come on do that thang
Dance with me, dance with me yeah
And all my down South shorties, come on do that thang
Come On Come On Come On Come On Come On
And all my East coast shorties, come on do that thang
Dance with me, dance with me yeah
And all my west coast shorties
Come on do that thang
Come On Come On Come On Come On Come On

[Verse Three]
She still talking loud but I heere her better now
She keep a thong print on in any weather now
No sight of a band but I can hear the horns playing
Da Dat Da Dat Da Dum
She got me hypmotize just like that thicky guy
Cause she been trying to prove her point since we been inside
So we can get it on, just wait 'til we get home
I'm on something, call my partner J, momma come on

Baby Show Something
Don't say nothing (Don't you say a word)
I just want to
See you work it (Come on baby work it for me)
That ain't frontin
Show me something (Let me see it girl)
I just try to
See you work it (I just wanna see you work it for me)</pre>
