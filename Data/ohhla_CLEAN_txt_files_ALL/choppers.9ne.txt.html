{"Turkey"} Sen kalk, bir minik mikrofonunu getir
Bak jak burada mikrofonuna tak, kagit kalem bir de ilham alinacak
Tam gaz choppers, havada düsman avina çikalim
Akalim, haydi bu battle'i kazanalim

[Interlude]
We started in the Midwest!
Now we 'bout to take it!
All over the world baby!
This is the pinnacle!
Yeah~! TECH N9NE!

[Tech N9ne]
Follow me, all around the planet I run the gamut on +Sickology+
They could never manage, we do damage with no apology
Pick 'em off the planet, got little manic cause I gotta be
frantic, I'ma jam it cause I'm an oddity
Gobble the track up like I'm grubbin at Mama Naka's
I could pop at you proper cause I'm partners with Waka Flocka
Gimme the top of hip-hop and watch him make 'em rock with a show stopper
Chakras poppin off the (worldwide choppers~!)
If you anybody you notice it
Tech is the pinnacle, not a identical soul is it
Load it, cold as the polar get, wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo it exploded the flow, behold it cause when the motor spit
A-bidia-bidia, never to get free of the real
Better get just near the mirror, ready to get near my heels
Gimme the knock and I'ma chop it, he came and he went tomorrow
But I'ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas
Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trippin when I rip it, I be the ish when I spit 'em up
Sorta like I was liquored up and backin up in the gut
Everybody be knowin I be actin up when I buzz
From Missouri to Canada I be keepin the stamina
If you've never been a fan of the man the planet's unanimous
Can I cuss? Fuck anybody, Tech is calamitous
Leave 'em in the dust, ain't nobody tough when I'm standin up
Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bot-tle
You wit it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinkin he give it to Poe and toss in Picasso
Killin ev-erybody off is the motto
And I'll be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the coffin when I go!

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years ahead of my peers
Want some you can come bring it right here (worldwide choppers)
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down, I was crowned when they found me

[JL - of B. Hood]
{"K.C."} Check it, I'm ahead of 'em, chop it up with the veterans
A legend developin, thank God I told 'em it's heaven
They gotta notice an elephant, none of you niggaz relevant
You delicate but lovin every second of this

[U$O]
{"Denmark"} De vil alle tjekke når vi ligger det, kommer ind og smækker
Det beatet jeg vækker det, I ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
Hanger med de vildeste gutter, det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle vild "Fucking Chopper"

[Yelawolf]
{"Alabama"} What if I ran into you with a pogo stick?
Hoppin on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness
With a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more churches like I was playin Hamlet
Syllable burnin that, internal damage
Swing batter batter but then I lay back on a hammock
under an oak tree like I was peelin pecans
but instead I'm peelin rappers' heads makin a sam-a-wich
Pick up a .22 and put a bullet inside
of a motherfucker from Westside, a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make 'em feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
when I hop on the fuckin beat and I worldwide chop
When I fuck with Tech N9ne, twist up a pine
and smoke a beat with Mr. Busta Rhymes, well sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
in a trenchcoat with a pencil and a watch
And drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throat with an alien probe
I'm light years!

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Twista! {"Chicago"}
Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
I hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-matism
And then I'ma spit 'em somethin so full of vengeance
that everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies cause of cannibalism
Breakin 'em off into particles and they in a predicament
that be never reversible cause a nigga be too versatile
Makin you nervous, you could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya then ya respect I better have it
Cause I'm an anomaly, and I'ma give a lobotomy
to any motherfucker challengin my astronomy
Hop in, I don't stop with the fires when the flame's thrown
I'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwin it up in the air, takin it there
We WWC, if you can't keep up shoulda stayed home
My-my-my alien knowledge be makin other astronomers
walk like this angel is a discovery of paleontology
So play me and I'ma be shinin on them haters
I'm finna be usin it as energy, watch how radiant I'ma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way down to your girl die
If I catch you fuckin with the most intricate lyricists
or even try to stop us cause we choppers and we worldwide
And I'm

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
{"New York"} See how they ask when I'ma stop it my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it and when I'ma drop it my dude
Inevitably is that I'ma be the most incredible dude
to ever spit on the record and put it together my dude (worldwide choppers)
And then they ask "What in the world is you provin?
What when you already the best and what the hell is he doin?"
Well I'ma be choppin and cuttin and breakin and beatin and shakin
and fuckin everything up 'til there ain't no further mistakin
and bustin everything up like a fuckin angry Jamaican
and shuttin everything up, 'specially the ones who be hatin
They lovin everything until I got 'em stutterin stupid
You hear 'em now? "D-d-d-d-don't d-d-d-do it!
P-p-p-please, wh-wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us?
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest!"
And now I'ma come and kill 'em, get 'em, hit 'em and finish 'em
and bang 'em in the head and diminish 'em
And then I'll hit 'em and give 'em the minimum, creepin and comin and killin 'em
Then he gotta be drillin 'em, thinkin they gotta be feelin him
Spittin lithium, see the way a nigga be spillin 'em?
And gettin 'em stupid to the point where there's no forgivin 'em
Hopin you're listenin and you're payin attention and you're witnessin 
the way that I be crushin in the mic and gettin in the zone
I be flattenin and packin in people from the front to the back and
they got me actin a fool, I'm black and nigga now I'm home~!

[Chorus]

[D-Loc]
{"Kansas"} My fire annihilate, make fighters retire instantly
I'm choppin 'em, call me Michael Myers in my vicinity
The way I be killin 'em with rhythm it get illegitimate
The Gilla will finish any in a predicament (worldwide choppers)
And the enemies in the vicinity I gotta mac 'em
They know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
The history of a lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals
Check my résumé, they say that Gill God is biblical (worldwide choppers)

[Twisted Insane]
{"California"}
I hit 'em with venom when I get up in 'em, I bend 'em and send 'em and you can feel me
Diggin up in your brain and bringin the pain, they often wanna kill me
Fillin 'em with that fury, get up in a hurry, you can feel the real me
Comin in with that shit, I'm havin a fit and you will never peel me
off of you when I'm on top of you, I got the drop on you
Been poppin off, I hit 'em up with a bullet to the (brain)
You can look into the eyes of a heathen, breathin
You fiendin and dreamin to find a demon, name insane
I'm a worldwide (chopper~!)</pre>
