[Cee-Lo Green]
The wine is white, and the lights are dim
They warned you, don't go home with him
These guilty feet'll never dance again
(I know, but will I ever get the chance again?)
I've been held in contempt for an incident
It takes two to be intimate
So by no means was she innocent
(Well it wasn't a crime, but admit the sin)

[Chorus]
They said, that chivalry is dead
Then why is her body (body) in my bed?
At sunrise, the morning papers read
They found a body (body) in my bed (ahhh)

[Cee-Lo Green]
Ahhhh! Can nonchalance be ambiance? Of course
I lean toward her and whisper the choice is yours
Need I remind you that I'll have no remorse
(I understand)
Here's a kiss, sweetheart this won't hurt a bit
I can kid with kindness or murder it
Then I would face the time a murderer would get
(Or get away with it) Life

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Yes, ahhhh!
May I?
You're so good looking
Let me touch you
Ohhh {*inhaling*}
You taste so good...
Yeahhhh {*fades out*}</pre>
