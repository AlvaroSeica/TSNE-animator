[Chorus: Lil Reese]
What's up with all these fuck niggaz
What's up with all these fuck niggaz
They fake as fuck, man, I can't trust niggaz
300, it's just us, nigga
Wassup with all these fuck niggaz
They fake as fuck, man, I can't trust niggaz
Wassup with all these fuck niggaz
Too many faces, I can't trust niggaz

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
What's up with all these fuck niggaz
I'm getting money, I can't trust niggaz
I grab my .30 if you a little bigger
He pillow-talking, that's for bitches, nigga
Your bitch want me, I pass her to my niggaz
Got so much swag, these hoes, they feel a nigga
We bought more choppers cause the streets got realer
Ain't never seen you, so I ain't gone serve you, nigga
What's up with all these fuck niggaz
And we play for keeps so it's no worries with us
And we shooting this shit, this a true story, nigga
I'm Glory'd up, I'm in my glory, nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
I'm big boss Fredo, what's up with all of these fuck niggaz
Trap house full of crack, them pillow cases stuffed, nigga
I don't fuck with fuck niggaz, fuck with me, you get trunked, nigga
Step up in the club, bet none of us get touched, nigga
All us got .30s, we let them bitches bust, nigga
All us got .30s, we let them bitches bust, nigga
Got a young nigga that's 15, and all he do is slump niggaz
Young nigga that's 15 and all he do is slump niggaz
Dissing us, you drunk nigga? Your whole squad full of punk niggaz
Don't make me grab that pump, nigga, turn y'all to some skunk niggaz
Bitch, we them niggaz, and ain't no way around it
I got a lot of guns, I'm talking hundred-round shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I'm toting, folk and 'em on pill, they rolling
We lurking, see 'em on 'em, headshot, told little bro "Dome him"
Cause little bro' keep it on him, he shoot, he shoot, he blowing
Face shot, so ain't no viewing, closed casket, ain't no face
No face, it ain't no case, police, it ain't no trace
That's why I use the 8, sometimes I use the .30
That's when we do 'em dirty, that mean we show no mercy
That loud, that pipe be perfect, ain't a nigga perfect
Don't be no dummy, boy
A lot of niggaz paranoid
Free bro and 'em in the slammer, boy
Free bro and 'em in the slammer, boy

[Chorus]</pre>
