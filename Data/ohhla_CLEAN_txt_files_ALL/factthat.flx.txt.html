[Intro: Sample from "Lookin At The Front Door" by Main Source]
You don't know the pain I feel when I see you smilin, and when I roll up you start whylin
So I front like everything's hunky dory, but it's a whole different story

[Chorus: Sample from "Lookin At The Front Door" by Main Source] (Maino)
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me (Uh! Yeah! Funk Flex!)
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me (They can't fuck wit us! Unstoppable!)
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me (Yeah! Maino!)

[Verse One: Maino]
You don't like the fact that I'm never caught up in actin
Trip out from jail and landed the side of Aspen
Hopped out the well hoes heads turnin like backspins
Black flag mob my dogs ready for action
Yeah! These niggas never been 'bout that
Run up on Mouse bet he, never without that
When you hear me scremin I live it baby don't doubt that
Bitch gave me head for days she want her mouth back!
Bulletproof love for my warlords
Fuck these industry bitches man they all whores!
Hundred rounds in the trunk is what they called for
Tattoo shirt off I'm 'Pac Shakur!
What it be like nigga?!
Came to the game just me my nigga!
Hoes on my tip like T.I. nigga!
Bitch it's The Mafia meet my niggas!
YEAH!!!!

[Chorus: Sample from "Lookin At The Front Door" by Main Source]
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me 
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me 
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me 

[Verse Two: Mouse]
Yeah! Look! Pull right in that ghost and dead niggas
Funeral snap at one in the head nigga
Got a coffin in the grave for all of you fed niggas
Louboutin path I'm leavin 'em red nigga
Yeah! I ain't watchin the speed somebody save me
Two hundred pounds in the trunk this nigga crazy
Boy, threw a benz in the club just ask anybody
Where you at?! Band for band I'll match anybody
Hustle hard Mouse do that there!
With them all white squares know I move that there
Where they at I don't see 'em, heard that they tried to be 'em
Fuck around when I peep 'em, leave 'em right where I see 'em HUH!
They don't like that cooked it up crack that
Million dollar driven got a hundred in a knapsack
One in the head if some nigga wanna snatch that
Bang-Bang anywhere gang nigga we like that!!!
Mafia!!!

[Chorus: Sample from "Lookin At The Front Door" by Main Source]
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me 
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me 
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me 

[Verse Three: Lucky Don]
You don't like the fact that how my niggas is floatin
Fuck you bitch ass nigga no sugar coatin
Now who you mad at me or yourself you fake
It's like the g on your belt, apply pressure, or he's gonna melt
That boy tellin you could read it yourself
He was bustin his gun, so I ain't think that he needed the help
Rap nigga left shit on the shelf
That-That nigga couldn't swim for delf
The mafia we all in, my brother's keeper, we all in
Good mugger niggas we all yen
Middle finger in the air wavin, I'm tryin to be one of the mafia's favorite
The team that I chose and I'm not gonna trade it
Jumpshot in your face and I'm not gonna fade it

[Chorus: Sample from "Lookin At The Front Door" by Main Source]
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me 
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me 
You don't like the fact that I'm me-You don't like the face that I'm me
