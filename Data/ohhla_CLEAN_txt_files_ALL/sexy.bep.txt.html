I took your picture,  with one particluar reason
and it's to capture your character
I like to sit and stare at 'cha
ain't nothing wrong with starin at 'cha
girl don't get scared that I envison us getting married
and I ain't tryin' to rush nuttin'
cuz I ain't rushin'
it'll take a time like, "what's them things that move slow you know them...
damn..I can't think cuz you on my mind..."
and when you on my mind can't find anything to ryhme with ryhme
I'll gotta ryhme ryhme with mixture
and speakin' of mixture
with you I wanna get mixed up
I'm like a record and you're like a record
so let's let the DJ mix us
you're like an elixir
that's got me tipsy
this is just like ripplets
believe it or not girl but I love you

[chorus]
Girl you really got me goin'
outta control
I don't know what I'm doin'
let's let it go
and do what we do best
take off our clothes
we look better undressed

[Bridge-repeat 2x]
let's get sexy
let's get sexy
sounds so good
sounds so good
fightin' is rightin'
fightin' is rightin'
let's get sexy
it's so much more exciting

[Verse 2]
For you I'm a fanatic
I'm a addict
you're sexy antics turn me on like automatic
no need to get dramatic
but I gotta have it
(gimme gimme gimme gimme)
gimme some of them sexual acrobatics
pharmachutal girl, anything that suits you girl
things you ain't used to girl
come over here and let me show you just how willy do it
I'm a freak and u knew it
you're a freak and I knew it
baby le'ts get to it

[chorus]

It's called the S E X X X X
(YES YES YES)

[Verse 3]
You take me to extasy
without takin' extasty
its exactly like extasy
when you layin right next to me
I'm sexin' you
sexin' u
you sexin' me
sexin' me
it's feels so damn natural
but we doin' so naturally
I'm likin' you rubbin' me
and u likin me rubbin' you
da passions emaculate
while you lovin me lovin you
I love me puttin me in you
make love to you
just like soliderman play piano
[Play]
