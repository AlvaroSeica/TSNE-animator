[Intro/Chorus]
I'm so turned up right now
I'm on way past ten
Think we made it though
We almost made it though

For anybody ever shitted on your dreams;
... Fuck y'all
Hatin' niggas that was on your team;
... Fuck y'all
Bitches that was caught up in the scene;
... Fuck y'all
Now everybody say the same thing
... Fuck y'all

[Verse 1: Gzus Piece]
Been down this block before
I use to hustle on it frequently
Been working like a slave
Trynna make sure all my peoples eat
Last year you wouldn't speak to me
But now you wanna freak with me;
But I'm a still accept the pussy
Cause it's just the creep in me
I do alot of shit that I won't rap on
Cause it's in the streets;
It's morals over money, and
It's silence over secrecy
Damn, How you just gon' act
Like I finna' make it?
I'm thirsty on the ground
Like big homie on that spaceship
Yea...

[Chorus: Gzus Piece]
I'm so turned up right now
I'm on way past ten
But I still gotta ways to go
We gotta ways to go
Yea...

I'm so turned up right now
Where should I begin?
I think we made it though
We almost made it though
Yea...

[Verse 2: Gzus Piece]
I'm so close I can taste it
And I'm not even wasted
Say what's up to my cult
We here to lead you out the matrix
We get gear by the cases
You still stuck on that fake shit
I roll the blunt and face it
Cause I just couldn't take it
This shit don't even make sense...
How could you even hate this?
But I guess I should thank them
Cause that's just motivation
Them goofies ain't gon' say shit
Except Congratulations
It's funny, cause it's crazy
Like them niggas that was hatin' on your way up
Just know they gotta see you on their way down, straight up
And in the stereo, the only way that you can play us
It's Treated undefeated;
And we comin' for them majors... bitch

[Chorus: Gzus Piece]
I'm so turned up right now
I'm on way past ten
But I still gotta ways to go
We gotta ways to go
Yea...

I'm so turned up right now
Where should I begin?
I think we made it though
We almost made it though
Yea...

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Touchdown
Who you gon' trust now?
When you blow...
Spontaneous-ly combust now
Now they wanna fuck now
Like you give a fuck now
You use to be an unknown
But now you one of us now
Go ahead and turn up,
Nigga, turn up
And all them brain cells
Getting burnt up
In a furnace,
Don't concern us
With them problems of tommorow is a journey
Turn up

[Chorus/Outro: Gzus Piece]
I'm so turned up right now
I'm on way past ten
But I still gotta ways to go
We gotta ways to go
Yea...

I'm so turned up right now
Where should I begin?
I think we made it though
We almost made it though
Yea...</pre>
