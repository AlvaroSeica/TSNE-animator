[Chorus]
Witness the come-up, it's Kapp, this shit ain't only just rap
This is my life on the track, this is a matter of fact
I know the game and its traps, hooked on this beat like it's crack
Somebody bound to react, but I will bomb back

[Madd Kapp]
People take personal shots, personalizin they disses
I just dismiss it as bullshit, horse's mouth always spittin
Some venom in it, pretendin the chance of winnin
Against me there's only endin, the square that I've been defendin
is guarded so it's just senseless to FUCK, with my relentless
Just swingin right for the fences invadin your residences
Hey hey~! Stand at attention, the general just took the floor
Say prayers, take all your vitamins, BROTHER I'M TOO RAW
Invitin the whole world to finish my Rubik's Cube
My brain don't work the same, don't mean to come off this rude
Just spittin some written words, different from the herd
I'm only tryin to get heard, flippin the industry the bird
Maybe I'm off in the head, but I'm never soft in the head
Many groups I lead, I taught 'em how to fish now they fed
Vividly seein red, so FUCK what a hater said
I don't give a damn about it, welcome to Crazy College, ha ha

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
And this is not a real song, and this is not a real song
This is some shit I put on, it's just some shit I spit on
And this is not a real song, this is not a real song
This is not a real song, it's just some shit I spit on

[Chorus]

[Madd Kapp]
The shortest verse ever written, you wanna hear it just listen
to my ridiculous mission, I wrote it while I was pissin
It's time to get out of here, but I know you're waitin to hear
the next song and its near, now I can drink me a beer
And leave this beat in your ear, this room is smoky in here
I'm gettin tired of rappin in this uncomfortable chair

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Bomb back, bomb back, bomb back
Said I will bomb back, bomb back, bomb back
Yeah I will bomb back, bomb back, bomb back
And I will bomb back, bomb back, bomb back
