Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Migo!
Sup Zay'?
They can't fuck QC

[Chorus: Quavo]
Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me (No Way!)
You niggas will never be bigger than me
These niggas ain't built like me (Not at all!)
Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me
Bet you ain't never seen no young nigga fucked of the profit
Get it back, they ain't built like me

[Verse 1: Quavo]
These niggas ain't built like me
I can turn a whole nick into a mother fucking key
Look at you nigga you ain't never been an OG
Nigga I ain't choose the trap, nigga trap chose me
"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"
That's the late great words of Mohammed Ali
Got to move real smooth, if the feds watch me
Got to hit them real hard if a nigga try me
"Boom! Boom! Boom!"
Can we fix it, like Bob the Builder?
Break in my trap and I kill ya (Pswiw!)
These nigga ain't built like my nigga
Down in Rose West side and Williams
That is the moral of the story
You niggas can't built like that with no courage
You niggas out here were left hurting
Locking the block down like Richard Sherman

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me
Hit the club I'm glowing in the back of VIP
Straight through line, nigga don't serve me
Give the wine to the bitchesâ¨, cause I'm pouring up lean
Smoking OG like it's nicotine
I got the molly, the Percocet, and methamphetamine
We kicked the Versace went to the Giuseppe store
Grab that shit straight off the mannequin (Giuseppe me)
You fuck niggas ain't in my weight class
I'm heavy weight, you niggas light weight
When it comes to this rap shit
You Sonny Liston and I'm Cassius Clay
"Paw! Paw! Paw!"
Running chickens on a Tonka toy
Beating the pot â¨like I'm Pretty Boy Floyd
Independent just like Macklemore
Hitting it hard like MacElroy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Niggas ain't built like Offset
Sipping on Actavis like it was MoÃ«t
What you think you doing with your little bitty Rolex
Little bitty nigga but I'm built like Bow-flex
Wanna come back hit a nigga like jack
ATM bag that's a money book bag
Don't get it twisted, I get on yo' ass
Don't let the rap fool you, I've been sellin' bags
Run to the money got energy like I'm a generator
Maison Margiela my shoes is an alligator
When we got beef I'm the one who's the instigator
When I perform they say I look intimidated
I run off a ticket like I was a scientist
You rappers is fake, you an animation
And I'm a G but I'm not a Mason
I'm playing with money like recreation

[Chorus]</pre>
