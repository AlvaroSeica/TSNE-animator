Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
We don't give a fuck about the time
Stuck inside the fireway
We up all night
Feeling like a vampire
Ya I see ya
Over there with your crew
Shawty get it I can get it like we do
Got it lowkey poppin over here, ya [x3]
It's lowkey poppin over here
ya

[Verse 1]
Now if you meet me in the club
Guarantee to see a bottle pop
Know we got it lowkey
Poppin like a bottom lock
And I don't know the time but I know we on a model watch
Cuz early in the morning tell them toast
Mazel Tov
Said I'm bout to put it down
Emo
Soon as I walk in they jump on me like Dino
Very important people got their hands up like a heist
And baby let me get you high
I hope you're not afraid of heights
All night, damn right i got a full prescription
I'll be stuck inside the vibe got a full subscriptions
Takin shot after shot like a full blown semi
Do it big and every minute y'all make em tell em

[Chorus]
We don't give a fuck about the time
Stuck inside the fireway
We up all night
Feeling like a vampire
Ya I see ya
Over there with your crew
Shawty get it I can get it like we do
Got it lowkey poppin over here, ya [x3]
It's lowkey poppin over here
ya

[Verse 2]
Back to the ceiling got everybody excited
Goin goin crazy club look like an asylum
I think I'm Chris Angel
Feel like I can levitate
While everybody stares
I think that I might take the elevator
See you at the top you may spot me like a freckle
Pocket full of presidential
Rozay redder than a vessels
Got me twisted like a pretzel
You ain't no where near my level hoe
I'm breezy as a polar bear
Cooler than the eskimo
With bitches on my back
Whole world on my shoulders
You can tell the bartender to make my drink a little stronger
Smokey as a locomotive on the trains to the sky
Know we been here for a while
Might have lost track of my mind but tell em

[Chorus]
We don't give a fuck about the time
Stuck inside the fireway
We up all night
Feeling like a vampire
Ya I see ya
Over there with your crew
Shawty get it I can get it like we do
Got it lowkey poppin over here, ya [x3]
It's lowkey poppin over here
ya

[Chorus]
We don't give a fuck about the time
Stuck inside the fireway
We up all night
Feeling like a vampire
Ya I see ya
Over there with your crew
Shawty get it I can get it like we do
Got it lowkey poppin over here, ya [x3]
It's lowkey poppin over here
ya</pre>
