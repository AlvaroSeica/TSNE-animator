[Remedy]
Like the calm before the storm and it came without warning
An ordinary day in New York, Tuesday morning
9 1 1 in 2001, the greatest act of terrorism done with no gun
No who ever thought that we'd ever get caught
With our noses in the air and no real support
Right here in America I was taught
That things ain't always what you think you thought
Yo attack on America, mass hysteria
And scarier, worldwide watch your area
For everything you see, there's a price and a fee
In the land of the brave and the home of the free
It only took one look with no sign of the crook
Forever in the books, the day the Earth shook
Us against them, forever no til then
And God bless the victims and never again...</pre>
