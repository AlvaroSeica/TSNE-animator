Yo, I.B.U, I.B.U
now just bless the verbal, Scott Lark Sensei
Want y'all to lay back and peep this feature presentation
It's all real...It's going like this
check it out

[Verse 1]
It's the feature presentation, shots fired live on location
Put you in a sticky situation if you wanna follow
because it's hard to swallow
You see I woke up in the morning at 5 am
Hit the L, smoked a cig, drank some gin and then
Hit the L, smoked a cig, drank some gin and then
I woke up and did the shit all over again
And after that I grabbed my gat that I just had cleaned
Dollar bills, gotta build, gotta get that green
Baby Pah, ?blue stars got L-A-Ark?
What I say, ok, now play that song
By Soul 2 Soul "Keep on moving don't stop"
I killed a million devils with just one glock
Cuz i'm the supa dupa brand new industry trooper
Cleaning up shit with a used pooper-scooper
Driving down to Washington to kill Bill Clinton
??Rob the mint, and then read Bill tritton??
As I hop on my private jet set for Asia
Bitches all around the world is lightin' up my pager
I smoked the bong with Saddam Hussein on his plane
As soon as I got off of my plane
He had a jacuzzi with five groupies holdin' uzis
Hoochies, even that Stetsasonic chick Suzie
She said, "Hey, ain't you that rapper?"
Slapped me in the face and called me a chick basher
She stuck the gun in my nose, I froze
Made me lick her toes and her asshole
I couldn't do it, I had to do it
The move: I grabbed the uzi and sprayed Suzie in the movie

[Chorus]
It's the feature presentation
I keep the party jumpin' off of lyrics
i be bumpin making people edible like Jeffrey Dahmer when I bomb it

(It's the movie, listen to the movie, it's the movie, nothin' but a movie)

I grab my pen and begin to flip the script the shit
in which I pick the kick bass out of it like other shit they heard me
kickin'
what a difference...

(It's the movie, listen to the movie, It's the movie, nothin' but a movie)

[Verse 2]
It's the feature presentation
You don't know me, ain't no relation
Like Mobb Deep, crossing borders with the Haitians
Who would of thought that it would have occurred
She knew me, I knew her, hey, we both knew each other
She said, "It ain't goin down like what"
I said, "Me leaving here without gettin' the gut?!"
Fast-forward ?To a wind? I started knocking it off
I came down the throat and then my shit got soft
She started playing with my balls
which once again made my shit get hard
Who would have thought i'd be in a jacuzzi
On a airplane with four bitches holding uzis
Is they gon' kill me? My stomach is woozy
Saddam eating JIFF with a spoon his mother was choosy
I twist my head, wished upon a star out of there
Disappeared and reappeared elsewhere
Somewhere in the Everglades
All the hunnies looking sunny all the men just shared
Whether you're black, Puerto Rican or Caucasian
South-East Asian, Malaysian, feature presentation

[Chorus]
I keep the party jumpin' off of lyrics
i be bumpin' making people edible like Jeffrey Dahmer when I bomb it

(It's the movie, listen to the movie, it's a movie, nothin' but a movie)

[Verse 3]
I slow 'em down, when I throw 'em down, tempo the track
I kick the crazy tight flow like i'm in every back
I'm kicking nigga's backs out like ?the spine I disperse?
Livin fat like Heavy D I don't curse, na fuck that
Shit pussy God i'm too hard-core, break a nigga's jaw more
Who should have put up his guard more
Ruff edges rugged, cuz mother fuckas love it
Fuck it, i'm too far above it, yo
I grab my glock and my cock standing out on the block
I used the dock and I knocked now they opened a lock
And then they let me inside, I caught a venomous vibe
They said "Lark, welcome back. Where you been all this time?"
I said "Later for all that, I heard you was pourin' shit
about your mouth around my niggas, we ain't goin' for it"
A nigga said "You in my crib and disrespect me like that
Is gonna break you two by two I know you cool and all that"
Mad niggas went bad and started hittin' the door
Scott Lark licked a shot, a nigga fell on the floor
I felt bad cuz the nigga I shot was innocent
So I shot another nigga cuz he started the shit
His fuckin' guts hit the ground like spaghetti
Then I checked his pockets for fuzz, yo I thought you knew already
Scott Lark be fuckin' it up
I make the hoes say "Scott Lark fuckin' it up!"
The rim-shot..

[Chorus]
I keep the party jumping off of lyrics
i be bumpin' making rappers edible like Jeffrey Dahmer when I bomb it
(It's the movie, listen to the movie, it's the movie, nothin' but a movie)</pre>
