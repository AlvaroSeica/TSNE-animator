[Chamillionaire]
They see me and they be like "Koopa where the hell have you been?"
Course you wouldn't know cause where I'm at you never have been
Money that I'm lookin at it rarely ever is Ben
It's more like pound, euro, rupee, it's whatever, a yen
Swimsuit models at the do' tell Tyson tell 'em come in
Got to have a workin visa and some cheddar to spend
They say revenge is really somethin that's embedded in sins
Hope God forgive me cause I got it and could get it again
Hold up, saw Snoop and Jigga they told me to stay the humble guy
Saw 50 Cent and he told me create a homicide
Them Universal clowns told me I need to dumb it down
But crash dummies don't ride with insurance on they rides
Stylist and a media trainer is what you have to get
Cause your whole image was just created from out of tablet
Fickle fans flock to these fakers like it's a mag-a-net
I'm accurate, stay stuntin and stackin, go get'cha camera trick
Because I'm livin better now {"livin better now"}
I'm livin good {"However livin better now, better better now"}
{"However livin better now, livin better now"}
I'm livin good {"L-L-Livin better now, livin better now"}
{"However livin better now, livin better now"}
I'm livin good {"However livin better now, better better now"}
{"However livin better now... better now"}
{"Drop top BM's, I'm the man girlfriend!"}

Uhh
I got the stacks, I got the plaques, I wreck the tracks
I'm the dopest Houston artist not opinion that is fact
I'm runnin laps, all 'round they raps, don't ever slack
And if I lose it all they know I'm just gon' get it back
They say I changed, hell yeah I changed, switched up my chain
Switched up my Range, but it's the fame, that's what they blame
I can't complain, I'm still the same, ain't with the same
people I came, with in the game, but I love it mayne~!
Some think I'm strange, I thought you knew, some tried to sue
Lawyer's a jew, publicist is too, but who are you?
She lookin cool, her sister too, her man a fool
Ain't got a clue, that I'm 'bout to do a body physical
That's to his boo, sick with the flu, my ride is ill
Pan the mirror, deadly as ever, it's time to kill
Look at the WHEELS, it give 'em chills, they takin stills
Takin pictures, I'm askin chickens, ay how does it to feel
to know I'm, livin better now {"However livin better now, livin better now"}
BETTER {"However livin better now, better better now"}
I'm livin good {"However livin better now, livin better now"}
I'm better {"Livin livin better now, livin better now"}
I'm livin good {"However livin better now, livin better now"}
You know coastin through the city man, top down, ain't nuttin now
{"However livin better now, better better now"}
{"However livin better now... better now"} You know why?
{"Drop top BM's, I'm the man girlfriend!"}
I been the man!</pre>
