[Intro: Yelawolf]
Yeah I'd like, to sing you a, a little ditty
Ahem... HA HA HA!

[Chorus: Fefe Dobson]
They shoulda never ever let you out
Cold animal with a mouth from the South
What'chu gonna say? What'chu gonna do?
Cause you know they coming, coming after you
Watch out for the D-boys!
Watch out for the boys in blue
You better keep it movin! {"Big boy"}
You know they're takin shots at you
Cause you're an animal, ohh

[Yelawolf]
Here we go!
Alabama's own wit it - promenade!
And I'm in a zone now - everybody!
Bringin them home baby - to the stage!
Slick Ricky Bobby in a NASCAR
Runnin over motherfuckers like I'm in a bar
Sentimental motherfuckers in a cookie jar
Be the late night snack, I'm Santa Claus
Down in Panama Beach drunk in my underalls
Playin underwear volleyball with your broad
I ain't bothered by your triple D's, not at all
Let me hold 'em up for ya baby while you walk
Wanna get the party bumpin, let me do my thing
If the marijuana plant need watering
Throw it in a bong, let it start bubbling
Know what I mean butterbean? Bada-bada-bing
Trashy white (white) pass the mic (mic)
Yeah I'm doin 'em dirty (dirty)
Fists start pumpin when I'm in the lights
like I'm rappin in Jersey (Jersey)
Never get elegant in elementary
Never learned to write in cursive
Raised by the country B-boys, I'm elegantly perfect
Rack it in, pack 'em into the back again, rap it up
Wrap it in sicker than a pack of ten Mini-thins
You'll get when I win but I won't lose
In fact I'm gonna win, win again
With another hand, here's another hand
Here's another hand, dealer can I get another hand?
Here's a hand, King King King King King bitch
Ghet-O-Vision in the Dirty South and you know we're gettin clean rich
Yeah~!

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
Candy-coated whip runnin over candy-coated rappers (vroom!)
Panties on her drip, do a backflip for me
Baby be an acrobatic actor - action!
Do a cartwheel on a bar
Will you do a cartwheel while I chill on a bar stool?
Will I throw a dart at a wet seal?
Well if I see a whale I'ma throw a fuckin harpoon
Go Looney Tunes and lose your Fruit of the Looms 
to prove you're in a room, you're shroomin to the moon
But in the mornin you're wakin up like a broom
swept off your feet cause Yelawolf ain't a groom
I ain't poppin the cherry, I'm poppin berry moonshine
Hop in the bedroom, let's move
If you wanna compare me, compare me to a legend
Don't compare me to a young fool
Go get a gun, go get a gun
I'll get a cinnabon and sit upon ya fuckin roof
I live it son, I get it done, fuck anyone
Yeah fuck anybody who ain't fuckin with the crew
Yeah throw another bucket in the pool
Dry it out now everybody skate
Cause I'm a lord of a doggy town (Wolf!)
A-L-A-B-A-M-A my state
My state of mind 1985 wide body
Lookin for the little small-town keg party
Wanna get drunk, wanna fall up in a hottie
Get shit-ty like a port-o-potty
So, jump on the paddywagon like a Pakistanian 
packin a mac-11 with a pack of maniacs
11:30 back at it again, I'm ready for the battle 
when and where motherfucker, they let another cracker in
Yeah~!
