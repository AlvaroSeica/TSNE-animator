(That's what you won't do!)

[Lupe Fiasco]
The mind's all a flutter no pigs on the gig 
No swine for the supper, no wine in the cupboard 
Everything of mine must show signs of the suffer
And keep you abreast/a breast of the utter/udder, struggle
to keep it all fresh like tupper
One of the tougher Gingerbread Men out the cutter
Skin ain't Huck' Finn but I ain't Nigger Jim, motherfucker
I'm more like Clubber, from the upper cut of the gutter
Never kowtow, I won't bow down to the bull like Calcutta
That ain't what I'm rappin for, I'd rather be a matador
So ta-ta/tartare, I'm rather raw
I know that sounds fucked up like a repertoire
But it's no Ruth's Chris if I lose, so I choose
to keep 'em seein red like Crips and Pirus
Ha~! He the guy who rides the haikus
Schooled at Cooley High, who high as the knots too
'til it's time to rise up, ride for our views
Tired of all the lies, won't abide by y'all rules
AKs' and IQs', so my skies are light blue

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Hey, I must admit it, I ain't ashamed I'm the best - OH!
They didn't get it, that's why I'm pissed off the rest - OH!
Niggaz is jealous, 'cause what I got restin on my neck - OH!
'Cause it took me from down underground to soarin like a G4!
Mug if you want to, bug if you want to
Chill if you want to, shrug if you want to
Build if you want to, joke if you want to, disrespect me
That's what you won't do (That's what you won't do!)

[Lupe Fiasco]
Been around the world the things that I've seen
These things get turned into things that I sing
Things stringed together with similes in between
Been mean since the teens, since little green Marines
I beam, Mean Gene, Mean Greene, lean, dream, bing, Dean King
Bling, bling, three rings, ringlings, O-O-O'ings - yeah!
To move towards it I had the root for it
like the home team, now they all lean
Singin that Queen, "Somebody To Love," "Rhapsody Bohem'", "We Are Champ-ions"
You don't wanna +Bite the Dust+, better stay on yo' scene 
I drop the +Lyric+ - Woodbine, Bokeem
You can document it - +Columbine Bowling+
I got the spirit, I require no wings
A fly MC, rivetin my passions to buy Pro Wings 
then wear 'em on the cover of your magazines
Feeling real Yeti in my size 14s' tryna drop to {?}, GLOW!

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Pharrell]
I'm performin, mama, now ain't nobody knowin me mama
All these hoes on me, mama, Why the hell you ain't want me, mama - HEY!
I'm performin, mama, now ain't nobody knowin me, mama - HEY!
All these hoes on me, mama, Why the hell you ain't want me, mama - HEY!

[Lupe Fiasco]
Success is my friend; who knew that when I grew up I'd be just like him?
Expect my roar if you reject my whim 
Erect my law and respect my pimp...
...I +Bring the Pain+ - Method Man 
I bring the pain - S&amp;M
Shout to Fam-Lay one of my bestest friends
Try and kill us, send all your deaths threats in 
I'll just reply with excess wins
Please God correct my sins and protect my kin, as I jetset
Headrest up and my leg rest in, let's go~!

[Chorus]</pre>
