[Intro: Layzie]
Yeah, yeah (Hollis make 'em clap to this)
L-Burna y'all (that's right)
Thug brothers (that's right)
Deuce-double-oh-six and beyond nigga
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh (Hollis make 'em clap to this)
Uh uh (Hollis make 'em clap to this)
And beyond nigga, to infinity nigga (Hollis make 'em clap to this)

[Layzie Bone]
I pop up on yo' block like nigga run it, gimme them diamonds and hun'neds
Mr. Stick-Up Man is comin for ya, you shouldn'ta been stuntin
I seen the envy in yo' eyes, when the purchase was mine
And I know you wanted to take it from me but it just wasn't the time
That's right  them killas I'm with ain't no security dogs
I done got my security in my drawers, niggaz is heavily armed
Ready to cock and discharge, I'm ready to ride for the cause
Be like Latifah and Jada big baby I'm +Settin it Off+
C'mon; it used to be when niggaz'd give you your props
But now you hear, "Fuck them niggaz man, them niggaz ain't hot!"
Them niggaz jumped off the pot and thought he was rawer than me
Little nigga with no experience thought he was stronger than me
I've paid dues to cruise around, with a heater at all times
Make moves around town, representin it at all times
Any nigga want some problems, they can get it, that's the motto
I'm on the grind, with my Thug brother sippin on the 40 bottle

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
You got some money in yo' pocket nigga (nigga)
You comin down on them twenty-fo's (fo's)
You a pimp and you mackin hoes (hoes)
With yo' pinky and yo' neck froze (froze)
Feelin good and you eatin good (good)
You get respect in ya neighborhood (hood)
With a style they can't fuck with (with)
Young, black, and comin up big (big)

[Bizzy Bone]
And be about it, be about it when it's on, it's on
This battle was not colonel, sex demons be gone
Hex me it's on, Bizzy Bone bring 'em again
Break change of imprisonment, you feelin me mayne?
Still family orientated conducted in the spirit
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent this
I represent it properly, yes I'm God's property
Nobody can stop me, nobody can stop me
Opt to be a lover and a fighter for truth
And the cops give me a hard time, raise the roof
190 proof, ever so clear as can be
See I can only be me, can only be B
I'm walkin in the forest as we dance to the trees
I've learned so much, hurt so much, everybody hurtin me
Still love 'em, in a storm forgive 'em
For everything if someone asks

[Chorus]  2X</pre>
