This is Don Newkirk from Cincinnati, Ohio.
Yeah, handsome. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?
Six-one-two, writers never die, writers never die.
Yeah, yeah, lavish I never had it
I get too happy doin atmospheric damage 
to your amateurish madness
Check your current status

[Slug]
Kinetic responses were heard frequent in the past
with speakin lashes in the toungues of father's demons semen
Somehow catered to the whims of later stood
check the you shoot like stormtroopers the arising Darth Vader hood
Gave a good thumbs up type of scream
to symbolize the arrival cause we've arised from the dream
With a red beam that fastens to my chest
wearin' a string of beads of sweat
decorating this helmet that shelters and protects my laptop
The brain contains the game and the fast talk
More traffic than the average vagrant's favorite drag spot last stop
To catch a breath for twenty miles
Cause this field is filled with more snakes than MC's that fake their freestyles
Your optimism is far from natural caught the label of asshole
cause I'm twice as tight as the rest this rappin's vaginal
Stand clear, cause when my shit comes the big fun
Pushin' up in and out of your bitch system like a piston
Glistening, in the twilight, hill top, with his ability stability
and shoot my spunk on your soliloquy
The children see right through the smoke screen
the mist around your soul provoking, your own choking

[Repeat 8x: Slug] (In the background)
Dungeon after dungeon, dragon after dragon

[Beyond / Musab] + (Slug)
In 97 the haters smash the tribe of set
New ward, what are the most important things in life?
To crush enemies? To see them driven before you?
Or to hold the head of opponent MC's, in your bare hands
Haha

I'm a co-founder, and one that likes to lounge on
Overcrowded spots so I can find someone to clown on
I hound dog, sniffin' out the unwanted
I said I'd let you live, but I never could keep a promise
With a lot of shit in my cottage
Come to my store, tryin to fight get fucked, like Marcellus Wallace
The BE calls it, anybody wanna, wander, on to the stage and try ta cha cha
Blah blah, that's all I'm hearin from the opposition
Just a buncha cockys dissin, ya kiddin
Wanna battle, huh?
Last two times mc's were found dead in a fast food line
Mash you, I'mma mash you (Who, them?)
Yeah, that crew
Separate the bitches like a capsule cause they fragile
Knock em off the saddle make 'em flip to the leaves
and they'll wake up paralyzed like, Christopher Reeves
Take a breath, here quick take one more
Before you finally realize that ya layin' in the morgue
This is the core, of the underground
Listen cause I'm sayin' somethin' now
The BE, only one allowed

Dungeon after dungeon, dragon after dragon

[Musab]
Steel is not strong
Flesh is strong
You understand me, boy?
Watch, watch this, you you, come here, come here,
come to me, come to me, witness this

[Slug] + (Musab)
I'm kind of conservative when it comes to this rap shit
because when I glace across the surface all the words is written backwards
And actions speak, much louder than your heavy rotations
I'll rock a crowd that's never heard of us, on any occasion
No longer patient you got my cranium achin
Prepare my awareness and start to measure up these square pegs
To figure out which crescent wrench it's gonna take
to beat this stake into my skull,
to numb, and dull this headache
Fiberglass rappers leave with cracked brains
Shattered names line the hallways with all the ways I can contain
under lids, locks in a two headed dog, with a sawed off
It's where Ant makes the breaks to get your rocks off
Molotov toss, into the ring of lost causes
formerly known as MC's (Southside lost provisions)
Cause it's more cost-efficient to kill the bad apple then save the core
then to nature let it run it's course, of course
You cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on this planet
(Cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on the planet)
You cross me, spread my wings and leave you stranded on this planet
Dungeon after dungeon, dragon after dragon after dragon

[Repeat 7x: Slug] (In the background)
Dungeon after dungeon, dragon after dragon

[Musab]
In 97, smash the tribe of Set, all the snakes
slitherin amongst the base, amongst the temples smashed</pre>
