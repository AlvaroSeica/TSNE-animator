[Intro: Ice-T as an L.A.P.D. Officer]
You have the right to remain silent
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law
What you gotta say?

[+] Uhh.. I didn't do it!
[-] Where the fuck is she? I've been pagering her all the motherfucking night
[-] Bitch you gotta call back, if you wanna see me, FUCK!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
I loved her with my heart and soul
Gave her everything diamonds and gold
She stabbed me in the back, fucked my friends
Partied in my house, and bitch wrecked my Benz

[Chorus: Everlast]
I used to love her (WHERE THE FUCK IS SHE?)
I used to love her
She did me wrong, now she's gone

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I've trusted her with cash and jewels
She laughed in my face, she called me a fool
The love I gave to her was all in vain
Now I think, it's time to return the pain
I came home one night, she was in my bed
With my best friend, giving him head
What really pissed me off about this shit
The bitch had never even sucked my dick!

[Chorus: Everlast with Variation]
I used to love her (FUCK YOU!!)
I used to love her
She did me wrong, now she's gone (HA HA HA!!)
She did me wrong, now she's gone (FUCK YOU!!)

[Interlude: Ice-T as The Judge]
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth, so help you God?

[-] I think, I plea Uhh.. Uhh.. not guilty!
[+] Wait a minute asswhole! not guilty? what the fuck you're talking about?
[-] You got a bloody glove, bloody car, bloody knife, bloody bitch!!
[-] Blooded carpet, blooded socks, blooded hand!!
[+] Call Shabarow, get cocking on the one

[Chorus: Everlast with Variation]
I used to love her (WHERE THE FUCK IS SHE?)
I used to love her
She did me wrong, now she's gone (HA HA HA!!)
She did me wrong, now she's gone

[Outro: Ice-T]
FUCK YOU!! ~ Fucking Slut!!</pre>
