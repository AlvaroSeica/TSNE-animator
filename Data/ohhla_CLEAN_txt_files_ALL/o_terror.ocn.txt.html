[Frank Ocean]
No baby no give me that,.don't touch that
Could you please be still (baby stop)
No baby you can't have that
Until you eat your dinner; guess I got to feed you

[Chorus 1]
Like a baby girl, you're the cutest, you're the cutest thing
but you can't always get your way
Like a baby girl, I want to keep that smile on your face, oh boy
but it ain't easy, you don't make it easy

[Chorus 2]
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think just like
A two year old terror
Twenty-wwo year old terror
Temper tantrums out of bound
Cause you want it when you want
Like a two year old terror
Twenty-two year old terror

[Frank Ocean]
Now you know you should be sleeping, but okay
I'll give you ten more minutes
We've been sleeping in the same bed cause you been havin nightmares
And you need me here, I guess I always treat you

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] - repeat 2X

[Frank Ocean]
You want love, well no more sugar for you
Hey~! You don't know to act, so no more sugar for you
You're jumpin off the walls, no more sugar for you
I said - ain't no sugar for you; well, just a little bit but

[Chorus 2] - repeat 2X

[Frank Ocean]
Love my baby, but, she terrorize me
Yeah, oh but yeah, I love my baby
But, she terrorize, te-terrorize me </pre>
