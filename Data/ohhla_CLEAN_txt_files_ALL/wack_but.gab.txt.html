Song:   Wack But Good People
Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com

[Chorus]
Love the good times and enjoy the company
Someone out of nowhere decided to emcee
And they think it's hate when you're trying to critique
There's most positively, definitely wack but good people
Complimenting songs, but you're lyin thru your teeth
Homies to the end, but their lines make you shriek
Don't know how to tell 'em without lookin like a creep
There's most positively, definitely wack but good people

[Gift of Gab] (wannabe rapper)

Yo, yo, what's crackin? (What's crackin, homeboy?)
What's happenin? (What's happenin, just maxin, homeboy)

(Straight after that cabbage for stackin, homeboy
 And you know I'm rappin now, I'm a savage - oh boy~! I be practicin
 We should do a song or, we should do a half or mini-album
 Puttin on on it and package it, cause man we go back and shit)

I think if you work hard on your delivery and master that
then after that, get back and we could tackle it

(You bastard! You think you super rapper or somethin now
 You a conductor in this pre-conducted traffic
 You don't believe in me?!)

Naw, I just thought maybe I have some tips that you could-

(Man, I really thought we was better than that, Gab
 Watch when I blow up!)

I hope you do, I ALWAYS had your back
I wasn't dissin, fuck this single shit, let's get back on track

(Exactly man, check out this verse I wrote it in a diner
 and it goes a little something like-) Hey what about those miners?

[Chorus]

[Gift of Gab] (wannabe rapper)

Man it's been a long time! 

(Man I ain't even speakin!
 I been workin, I been grindin and I ain't even eatin
 I ain't quit my day job, I ain't tourin, I ain't skiin
 I ain't flyin off to Brussels, smokin weed with Europeans
 and it's all your fuckin fault, Gab!!)

C'mon! What's the reason? I did five songs with you
Let you open in St. Petersburg, Atlanta, AND the Reno show

(You coulda kept on planning to do more than that
 The audience had booed me and threw water at me
 People walked off at my show and drove off in they Pontiacs
 You coulda been there man)

No really, I think I've done all I can

(Yeah right, you was really someone who I used to call my man
 Jay-Z would not do that to Memphis Bleek cause that is not what fam does!)

Maybe this just isn't your path, we all ain't rappers
and we all can't be the best at everything, I'm hella bad at math

(You know, I hear you! In fact, I'm 'bout to write it down
 And put it on my new album CAUSE FUCK THAT I'M INSPIRED NOW!!!
 Yeaaaah! Yeaaaaah!! These motherfuckers ain't gon stop me
 They CAN'T stop me! They CAN'T stop me!!!)
 
Go on and do it (Yeah...)
