[Isaiah Rashad]
Yeah, yeah
(-eah -eah -eah -eah; yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, hey-hey)

Modest, I, be in interviews, some niggas hatin'
Cause I play it like, I no have no clue that I'm the greatest (greatest)
Tori come, sit up on this dick, I see you waitin'
Need a baby cause I'm too young and wild to be the savior (savior)
Nail me to the cross and I'm just hanging (I'm just hangin')
Least they left the serpeant in my fingers, I'm just smokin' (hey hey)
Players from my city rarely make it to a poster (to a poster)
'less you got a warrant, what you got in that Corolla? (Hey)
Oh, officer, just Boosie Boo and DG Yola (ay)
"Won't let them haters get me down?" that's what they told us (told us)
It's funny how they blame the south when they weak shit don't blow up (don't blow up)
We came with all the funk while niggas act like they don't know us
Just livin' a lie, OG's actin' like hoes, we couldn't rekindle the fire
Nigga, retire, nigga, catch up with the time, I can see more than the block
I can see more than your spot, I don't be stuck in the past, homie, I'm puffin' he grass
Holdin' my cool like a strap, look at my southerner ass

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad]
Niggas try to tell you what you want (what you want)
But niggas rarely give you what you need (what you need)
Ay, bitch, I came right here with the bounce (with the bounce)
And if that ain't enough I got some weed (weed)
Yeah, cause niggas try to tell you what you want (what you want)
But niggas rarely give you what you need (what you need)
Ay, bitch, I came right here with the bounce (with the bounce)
And if that ain't enough I got some weed (weed)

[Isaiah Rashad]
Quiet, I be in living room, cuh, nigga shaded
with my Nia Long, I sing her a song, she masturbatin'
Then bring me alone, she got somethin' to say like Larry David
But I leave her lone, ho, I gotta go, I got a baby (hey hey)
Stuck in Babylon, niggas carry bombs and carry rabies (hey hey)
Who gon' speak for you? Who gon' sing your song if you don't play this? (hey hey)
I got stress for days, picture you go home and you that nigga (hey hey)
But can't pay your bill, you can't buy no diapers for your little one
Don't you pay for thrill, child support is like a check away (hey)
How you chill with Kendrick? Do you smoke with Q and Dr. Dre? (Dre)
Least today is real, I should ask some groupie for some face (face)
Just a steppin' stone, least them kind of bitches know their place (place)
This my second home, this where favorite rappers get replaced (placed)
This what the niggas from the South gon' kill that, doubt it, bring the bass (bass)
Bitch, I came here right here with an ounce (with an ounce)
And if that ain't enough you gotta leave (yeah)
