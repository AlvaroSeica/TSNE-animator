Ain't nothin worse than a wack mc
Unfortunately that's all that surrounds me
So I come to crush the un - stable structure
It's the return of the dopest Brooklyn motherfucker
To ever, ignite the mic, get it right
Mad respect, pimps grap your hoes
Punks grab your checks
What's next, pure nonsense and the style ya flex
And your so bloody pussy, you need a co-tex
Latex cause they're drippin vaginal juices
So many so called gangsta niggas and their booty producers
Now watch the act that's vanishin
Gold and platinum, but who gets the publishin
Not to rub it in, drop it in your box, now your dubbin
My company fucked up my projects momentum
But I'm still winnin
Cause I'm a winner
Came to the table with snakes they had snakes on they're plates
Plus niggas on they're plates, they put figures on my plate
I took the loot unscathed
Cause I couldn't dine wit em
See 17, age 19 (?)
On a podium, at this time you are rewindin
And like solar and lunar, you're clockin
It's to perverted

It's too perverted, you heard it

So deep, that it becomes fossilized
Too many times I find my style between mcs inside
(?), but they swallow their tongues like seisures
I pierce flesh and strike nerves like acupuncture
Or acupressure, feel the wrath of my mathematics
Kinetics, you need a local anesthetic
Cause your system has acquired an imune deficiency
Overwhelmed by my telepathy, no sympathy
Cursed (?) but graceful like caligraphy
And  (?) like (?) was not to mc
Life givin, yet I'm still deadly
And before you step to me
Remember it's too perverted

It's too perverted
It's too perverted, you heard it
[Repeat 2X]

Master rhymin so I'm steadily climbin
I rip through mics like when my dick strikes the hymen
Total controller, some claim to be bolder
But they rotate around the lunar
I keep it solar, polar
Who vibrates and radiates
Thunder, lightning, earthquakes from north to south
East to west test the best get sprayed
Drop jewels, burn papes, till my ride escapes
Akward flow to some it's even unorthox
Bone crushin, life threatnin like the jaws of a crocodile
Your hunny wishes to stay a while
And I told her she could stay
Am I foul or just to perverted</pre>
