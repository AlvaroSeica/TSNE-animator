[Intro]
{Who all the girls wanna get physical with?}
POLOW DA DON!! (Watch me do my dance boy)

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, yeah - go on, bring it back girl
Yeah, yeah - it's known for a fact girl
Just get it on the floor and do what you do
Just get it on the floor and do what you do

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, yeah - go on, bring it back girl
Yeah, yeah - it's known for a fact girl
Bet you can't do it like that
I ain't movin like that cause the track'll break your back

[Chorus 3]
What you came here fo' ha, if you ain't plannin to move
Let's get it poppin, you got nothin to lose
Just get it on the floor and do what you do
Let's get it on the floor and do what you do

[Jibbs]
Now I think it's just time for you to move
It's time for you to hit a home run like a bat girl
Go on give it a test, cause you could do it the best
Just be like Mitchell &amp; Ness and throw it back girl
Get with it, have ball and hit with it
Tryin to get with the pitch just thought that I'd mention it
Cause I been with it, in fact I'ma throw a hit with it
Tried to blow my mind when she turned around and spinned with it
So we could take it on back to the flo' ma
If you ain't dancin than you lookin at the do' ma
And she'll fall if she do a little mo' ma
Next thing she saw is them Lamborghini doors ha?
Don't get it twisted, I ain't sayin you could leave boo
Go on bring it back and you could show me what that thing do
Don't get it twisted, I ain't saying you could leave boo
Put it in reverse {and you could show me what that thing do}

[Chorus 1] - 2X

[Jibbs]
I'm 'bout to start of shoppin, you know them tags we poppin
Only the freshest I'm rockin, I'm grabbin new FITS~!
It kind of hard to fall, but it's so easy to ball
When I be hittin the mall to grab a new CHICK~!
Steady goin, tell her 'bout the party I'm throwin
I'm already knowin that she feelin the way that I'm flowin
Take the girl from her, and I'm bringin her out the Lou'
Lettin her see the palm trees, showin her how Cali do
From burnin one to doin the bounce then we hittin the crunk
As soon as we open the doors the party gon' jump
As soon as we turn up the music the speakers gon' bump
And anybody sittin down, we gon' tell 'em get up (get up)
Now I think it's just time for you to move
It's time for you to hit a home run like a bat girl
I know you herd this before but I'ma tell you some more
So listen carefully while I put it in fast forward

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Jibbs]
Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah...

[Chorus 3] - 2X
