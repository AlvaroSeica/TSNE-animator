Push (push). Pull (pull)
The allure
Trying to escape it
make it chase even more
Back against the wall. It's the flight of the fall
Now, now come along
To whom do YOU belong? (belong)
In the shadows is the skeletons of battles
And, the casualties of egos outta Tune, consumed
In the end it's what YOU choose to feed
The hungriest eat
In truth it's what you choose to see
So follow WE
The Light Bearers
Brighter in this dark era
Clear (clear). Calm (calm)
Sound the alarm
This is War comin' forth by day
Bend never break
Take that to the bank
Get it now. Why wait?
Pace it. You don't have to chase, its
Comin to u straight
Get the fuck up out the way
Mean what you say cause them words hold weight
Keep it movin'. YOU ain't gotta know the way
GO - Boog Brown

CHORUS:
Standing in the Shadows
Watching over YOU
Everything YOU do
Don't let them get to YOU
Life is a Battle
They're watching over YOU
Everything YOU do
Don't let them get to..
Yay though I walk through the Shadow of Death
I will not ever lose a Battle or Step
Yay though I walk through the Shadow of Death
I will never ever lose a Battle or Step
Yay though I walk through the Shadow of Death
I will not ever lose a Battle

Ahsai, Nokbai, Funlah
Pencul, Sensu, Husae
Tunglai, Miirnai, Kensah
iinu, wesai, disway

CHORUS:
Standing in the Shadows
Watching over YOU
Everything YOU do
Don't let them get to YOU
Life is a Battle
They're watching over YOU
Everything YOU do
Don't let them get to..
Yay though I walk through the Shadow of Death
I will not ever lose a Battle or Step
Yay though I walk through the Shadow of Death
I will never ever lose a Battle or Step
Yay though I walk through the Shadow of Death
I will not ever lose a Battle</pre>
