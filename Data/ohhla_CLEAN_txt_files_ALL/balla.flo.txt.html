[Chorus: Flo Rida]
This for my ballas ayyyy

All my life I'm tryin get money

[Flo Rida]
Flo Rida be the landlord I need that rent money
I'm a poor boy eryday I get cake honey
Birthday man my pinata my state honey
Take one glance and the prada got um haten on me
Gun shinin on the waist yeah the waist sunny
Like Biggie rappin I'll ain't the way dummy
Jack boys soveniers to the big tummy
New year chopper wet like the nose runny
Shot clothes takin over what yoes
Soround light bulbs where the sound light blows
The south got soul grand mama got gold
Real grandady like formin no smoke
This be the truth loose slips dext told
Got to get fat carrots see these xxx like kimor
Thick hips holla back like I'm in a lambo
Playin xxxxxxx my career peep the rap game cold

[Chorus]

[Billy Blue]

Never thought shitll pop off like this
Yeah your dam ryte fool I never had shit
Stuntin reel hard like I wanna blow it all

[Chorus]

[Brisco]
Boy I'm rich and yeah I'm gettin money
If it's close enough then I see it comin
Call me a balla call me what you want
Call me a real goon riding in a donk
Call me broke cause tht I ain't
I mite be a po boy trying get bank
All my life I've ben trying get mo
When it goes down I culd tell you how it go
Whoa
Straight from the hood to the good with the bad
Lot these growin up I wish I had
But everything in life ain't promised
Them the last words I herd from momma
Stay reel watching for the haters
Here they come but with money you forlay them
I feel like spendin and I want it
No matter how I get it

[Chorus]</pre>
