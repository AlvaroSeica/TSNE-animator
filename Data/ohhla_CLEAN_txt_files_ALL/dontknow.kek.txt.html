Oh yeah playas, it's definitely going down 
It's your partna the Mad Hatta, and I see ya acting bad 
Jamming that Lil' Keke "Don't Mess Wit Texas" c.d. 
But right now I need you to just take a, long big break 
And Lil' Keke serenade you lil' ladies out here, and do his thang 
This one called "Don't You Know", go on ladies you can get wet on this one 
  
[Hook: Phaz - 2x] 
Don't you knooooo-oow 
That I love you sooo-oo-oooo 
  
[Lil' Keke] 
Don't you know, I love you so 
I wanna carresse you slow, from head to toe 
Deep inside I go, baby scream for mo' 
We can play all day, at this game I'm a pro 
Let you run the show, a queen you will be 
Satin sheets packed lace, Victoria Secret 
And I know your body need it, gotta make you mine believe it 
All above fall in love, all my purposes defeated 
You have cheated on your man, to experience a G 
When you know that he got plex, with a playa like me 
I guess that Lil' Keke, has the key to the do' 
And I'm letting you ladies know, that I love you so yeah 
  
[Hook - 2x] 
  
[Lil' Keke] 
Bubble baths and a spa, menage tois 
You'll drive a foreign car, I'll make you a star 
As I floss Jaguar, to wherever you are 
Long distance in an instance, on my cellular 
And nowhere is too far, for my private jet 
I'm on the flight hold tight, keep it nice and wet 
Please don't get upset, the fun just begun 
One on one the job done, when you make me a son 
When you make me a daughter, do I need to pump harder 
Turn the temps up on the bed, so we can heat up the water 
A father figure, a thug life nigga 
It gets harder gets bigger, go deep into the river 
You shiver you shake, ice cream and cake 
I wonder how it feel, when your water breaks 
No mistakes allowed, at the rodeo show 
And I'm letting you ladies know, that I love you so 
  
[Hook - 2x] 
  
[Lil' Keke] 
As I gaze in your eyes, it's not a surprise 
That I'm the perfect size, for between your thighs 
Chastize and realize, don't need a disguise 
I'm a star on the rise, only eye for the prize 
Dig deep into your soul, and get caught in a rapture 
Your mind I'ma capture, night before or morning after 
First chapter love and laughter, beamers and Benz's 
Seven day vacation, all paid expenses 
I'm a playa for life, thanks to this rap 
I can floss I can flap, with my salary cap 
H-Town's on the map, and nothing is negative 
I'm the owner of the Third, I'll make ya an executive 
Consecutive you see, that you do wanna be 
With Lil' Keke, in the land of free 
Do ya wanna are you gonna, let's sit in a sauna 
And laugh our life away, while we blow marijuana it's going down 
  
[Hook - 2x]

Uh, I see you little ladies out there acting bad 
On that one right there, Lil' Keke from that city 
Don't mess with Texas, featuring Phaz 
Make sure you look out for him real soon aight huh 
Alright fellas, took your break ha 
Now here's something you can bang to, fool</pre>
