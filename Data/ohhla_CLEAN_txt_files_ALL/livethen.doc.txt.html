(Intro)
  
(Babe Reg)
Big up
From the begining of time
Mr. Doc and me be livin in tragedy, know
Bloodclots to all the adversaries from knew Jr. High
Me still round cuz that's all me knew
Malo, come again
Why me bless this time stressed
To make the best of time
You ever smoked to rip your chest open
We stressed out
So me smoke til me open
Me live me life
Me live me life hopin
Odysea L-O-C-P
In locomotion Immaculacy
One day we'll be toastin Crystil
But in the meanwhile I speak loud with the rapper Nefarious style
To let you know in the meanwhile I smoke fools before me pass out
And me promise to smoke with you in the next life
Chow
  
(Doc)
Yeah yeah! do you believe in me
There's only one way for you to find out
Trace it, and lace it, and review it
The past we'll go through it
In 1991, 16 paccin a gun
We looped out and locced like gun smoke
Met the big homie Foe Loc
Who intoxicated me with "Ides"
And had me review all kind of violent shit in my life
Like why I got stripes
The homie Reg a lready got drugged by the lo
Got picced up by Monterio
But that's another story so here we go
The homie Ceno came up from Altradino
Now we cliccin
Beyond that we all gang bangers
Steady dippin and all trippin
I didn't even have a fuccin place to go
Stayed like that for a year
And hooked up with Blacc Market and now roll
In 92 X got blamed for some shit he ain't do
In 93 Lynch got shot by a gangsta and that's coo
We slippin
You think you seen hard shit that's trif
In 96 some ho ass tried to locc me up fo life
Nigga I swear
  
I know...you've been...goin through it homie
 Doc: Yeah I know you've been goin through it
I know...you've been...goin through it nigga
 Doc: I know...you see we live and we live
I know...you've been...goin through it homie
        Doc: Yeah we've been goin through it
I know...you've been...goin through it nigga
        Doc: Yeah see first we live and we live
  
(Foe Loc)
Should have believed in me Foe Loc
The Loco god When I smoked yo spliff
91 swoopin up Mr. Doctor and uff I'm on on this
Liquid suicide and fools was trippin off the little loc
Til we started sweatin all these fools I wish I had it on video
Been doin this shit since way bacc ??ain't been there ya fools??
Didn't start rollin the Warstain till about 92
Hard headed and I never let anyone be the closest homie
Cuz in high school I put it down even when five was runnin up on me
And my folks was thinkin my mentality is to-bacc
But I never had a big homie to teach me how to act
These streets is where I'm at
Had 40's across my bacc
Knives and killa straps drawn on me and all of that
93 sewed up the East and the po-po's regulate
T.A.S.K. up in our houses no motivate on wait
Many thing happening lost a life my little Markie
Gone from his own hands wonder if death is creepin on me
and that's on god
  
I know...you've been...goin through it homie
 Doc: Yeah I know you've been goin through it
I know...you've been...goin through it nigga
 Doc: I know you see we live and we live
I know...you've been...goin through it homie
        Doc: Yeah we've been goin through it
I know...you've been...goin through it nigga
        Doc: First we gon live...then we gonna live
  
(Foe Loc)
Seems like the desprite times
The cause for desprite measures
But if you pullin liccs for desprite times
Then you doin it for the better
But if you enjoyin it then your doin it for the pleasure
And if you're doin it for desprite times
Then you're doin it for ever
What ever man can justify anything that they do
Peel your cap bacc over a fucc you and a dirty shoe
But who's man to question the mentality of a street soldier
All the livin our lives through the understand gettin over
Doc
  
(Doc)
Gettin over like homies who got addictions
And udilize the weakness to find yours
Like they doin liquor stores
It's all good
Cuz if I didn't have my motha fuccas I might have died
Or got caught for a hoo ride
That's why I loves to roll with pride
See when I get mine
Understand my whole world will get blessed
My whole got tests
That's why we all the best
With all the time I invest
Sweatin tears without the mess
I keep my niggas beatin in my chest
Much love homie
  
(Doc talking)
  
(Chorus in backround)
Yeah! been goin through it
Mr. Doctor been goin through it
Foe Loco been goin through it
Odysea, Babe Reg, Tre Eight been goin through it
All of Rosemont, the Blocc
Sacramento been goin through it
Cedsing been goin through it
Triple Beam been goin through it
C-locs y'all been goin through it
Stan been goin through it
  
This is dedicated to Markie
Much love
He went through it</pre>
