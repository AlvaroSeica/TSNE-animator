[ CHORUS ]
They say we got a black president, artificial intelligence
A man jumped over the moon
(Well you ain't seen nothing yet)
Cause my blood's burnin and the world's turnin
At a pace too slow to move
They say we got a black president, artificial intelligence
A man jumped over the moon
(Well you ain't seen nothing yet)
Cause my heart's burnin and the world's turnin
And I still got somethin to prove

[ KB iMean ]
Yo, the script about to flip up, police'll be the victims
And I be whistlin for my pits so they can sick 'em
On the other hand I just say I Michael Vick-'em
And throw him down the corridor till he's lost in the system
This is real (Talk about the streets)
Okay, I am a overlord overseein the senseless
Random acts of violence, product of my environment
If I don't succeed just dust my shoulders and try again
The line between love and hate was built wire-thin
Seein vivid images overdosin on Vicodin
And we ain't seein nothin but these beats bumpin
Revolutionary drums plus clean cuttin
We providin the hits that all the fiends lovin
I can't tell if they feelin it or they mean-muggin
Honestly speakin it's me, cousin
I'm knee-deep in the concrete, we keepin these streets buzzin

[ CHORUS ]

[ Styliztik Jones ]
I'm a visionary with visions of cemetaries bein filled
I carried obituaries of people that was killed
A vivid imagination, my imagery is real
A image so picture perfect the blind man can feel me, but still
(Talk about the streets) I do
Hog head for the cheese, I'm steazy fondue
Cooler than a swan dive in a pond or pool
Ponder views on life in a somber mood
Read a few psalms a day, I'm calm and cool
Palm trees and graffiti when I pilot through
Keep my eyelids open and my eyes don't move
I live in a city where they say the crime is cruel
Violins just play while the cryin they soothe
Say his eye's on the sparrow, so he watchin me
So I drive a Camaro like it got some wings
Feelin so overwhelmed that I got to sing
It's amazing grace, the days are great
Purple tree gettin turned into a Cajun grape
Told my mama at the young tender age of 8
That I'll never fall in love with a Caucasian face
But goodness gracious, I'm not racist
Wasted half my life lookin up at spaceships
Will it be my fate to be this great?
Guess I gotta wait till I see them pearly gates
