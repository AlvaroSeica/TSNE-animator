[Intro: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah.. Uh
Fa sho..

[Freddie Gibbs]
Alright now
Baby, times is hard so I'ma change my hustle to hard white now
And a couple of my customers show with they nose
But I suppose they wanna light up the pipe now (yeah)
Sellin straight dope out the ride 
Speedin past the police wouldn't advised
Got a hard pack of that Star Trek 
to make a bitch beam up to the +Enterprise+
and you and Captian Kirk tradin ass for worth
Let a bitch sniff ya pack, you got burned (Bitch!)
Still owe me twenty-three hundred for that twerk (Bitch~!)
Finna post up in ya place, so don't perk (Bitch!)
Nigga don't snitch, don't tell
Rap niggaz they recite that so well (Uh-huh, yeah right)
Be the same motherfucker that done ratted out his homie
He ain't even got no money for his own bail
Let's go deep... 
("Deep inside the ghettoooooo!") Where I be
Fuck witta nigga yellin, I be fuckin with the felons
If you buyin or sellin then you can find me
In the hood with hot goods, we got those
Nigga, I just stole this rim, watch the potholes
All laws are street codes, y'all forgot those
Homie, I done been in the block since a snot-nose
Deep... ("Deep inside the ghettoooooo!") Yeah, where I go
Eastside, 17th Ave.
Better keep a G-pass on you, G-I to Chicago
Where the real niggaz dead or locked up
Teenage pretty friends, they knocked up
The young niggaz here tryna get guaped up
They don't have no other choice, they washed up
Uh, livin on the edge of addiction, STDs', and enslavement
Black blood tend to flood the street pavement
White man set the price and we pay it, yeah
All a nigga want is whips and chains
Probably cause a nigga wasn't whipped and chained
to a bottom of the boat to the middle of the ocean
Stripped of my own motherfuckin name
Stripped of my whole motherfuckin culture
Sold by my own to the snakes and vultures
Reality is sad but it's true, so what can a nigga do
when ya own people don't suppo't ya
Fuck-ass cop tryna pull me over (what?!)
Trunk full of dope, but I rather get smoke than 
Live, sheeeit... ("Live in misery...")
(Look at how brave of this pig-ass nigga, man) Fuck-ass nigga man
I'ma take ya, to a place
where a muh'fucker gotta be a thug by nature
Where it's really all about that paper
Nigga try to jump off, we'll stank ya
("Deep inside the ghettoooooo!") Uh, where I be
Fuck witta nigga yellin, I be fuckin with them felons
If you buyin or sellin then you can find me
("Deep inside the ghettoooooo!") Yeah, where I go
...G-I to Chicago</pre>
