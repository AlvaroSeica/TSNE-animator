Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I been looking at you like the whole night
Don't know what's wrong with me, but you show right
I'll take anything, but hope I'm your type
And we can get together if it go right

[Chorus]
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down

DON'T TURN ME DOWN

Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
You so damn appealing
Nose up on the ceiling
I bought you them drinks
Don't think that we can't gon' be chilling
You think you know, you don't really know
How far I'll go, I'm a follow you outside that do'
And when we get out, girl please don't turn me down

[Chorus]
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down

DON'T TURN ME DOWN

Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down

DON'T TURN ME DOWN

Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down

I can't take rejection!

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Cause it'll be at least for a minute
I can be your boytoy if you let me get it
Tell me where the car's at, ain't nothing I can't spend it
I love your light skin, when hugging it with you
We was husband and wife it
I'm cuttin' it, yes indeed
I need your love and you love
And you best believe and if it's up in the air
Then I let you leave, without the rubbing
It's nothing sick I need you to be my robotussin

You came in here with that donkey
Now you wanna act like that you don't want me
I don't plan on going home lonely
Don't turn me down

Cause I'm broke and I need you to fix me
I'm a frog and I need you to kiss me
Put my face in the place where your lips be
Cause you looking extra crispy
So...

[Chorus]
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down

DON'T TURN ME DOWN

Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down

DON'T TURN ME DOWN

Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down

I can't take rejection!

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
Now I'm getting impatient
Girl you got me waiting
You so sexy, I want you
On my arm like a bracelet
I know I might, not be as good as
Them guys you like, you better tell them
Not tonight, it's only right
That you don't turn me down

[Chorus]
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down

DON'T TURN ME DOWN

Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down

DON'T TURN ME DOWN

Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down
Don't turn me down

I can't take rejection!

Girl I know you want me, act like you want me
Girl I know you want it, act like you want it
Girl I know you need me, act like you see me
Act like you see me, act like you see me</pre>
