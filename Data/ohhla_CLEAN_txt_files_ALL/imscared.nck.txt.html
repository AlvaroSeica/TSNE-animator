Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uhh
Y'all ain't ready
No, Uhh
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off, shake 'em off, uhh [x4]

[Verse 1]
Stomp down in the game like Omega Psi Phi
Who am I? Nick Cannon, bla-asian fly guy
Frequent mileages, stompin at colleges
Yo I be all up in the dorm like I'm down to scholarships

Shorty, hold me down it's over now
We clown around the town to Morris Brown
Chicks at Clark meet me in the quad
Trying to get somethin' for free like 106 and Park

Bethune Cookman good lookin'
What you got cookin' Bronx to Brooklyn
Tech if I recollect correct they off the deck
And we bailin' at Spelman I constantly rip

At Johnson C. Smith chicks want me to strip (no)
Won't see Nick on a "Gone Wild" flick
Got me shiverin', quiverin', don't know what to do
Oooh, little mama I'm scared of you, ha

[Chorus]
(Fellas) What you bout to do?
(Ladies) What you bout to do?
(Fellas) I'm bout to act a fool at this school
(Ladies) Ooooooh, I'm scared of you
(Fellas) Ooooooh, I'm scared of you

(Ladies) What you bout to do?
(Fellas) What you bout to do?
(Ladies) I'm bout to act a fool at this school
(Fellas) Ooooooh, I'm scared of you
(Ladies) Ooooooh, I'm scared of you

(yo yo yo)

[Verse 2]
I wish there was two of me
Like Lionel from "The Jeffersons"
Texas A and M saw this Mexican
And next of kin full of estrogen
And the wind and the Benz we begin again

Up at Michigan so I mean Wolverine
Shorty leaned on my b and I beaned in between
The knee and the knee, ooooh weeeee
Can't see how you fit that in them jeans

Mama stacked hair plat with platinum earrings
Hear me get amped when we at Hampton
Sweatin' and pantin' shoutin' and chantin'
Southern and Grambling girls are a classic

In the Bayou to the N Y U
Chicks at Cooper yeah they kinda fly, too
Got me shiverin', quiverin', don't know what to do
Oooh, little mama I'm scared of you

[Chorus]

(uh uh uh)

[Verse 3]
A girl I barely knew up at Prairie View
Started poppin and droppin' I'm scared of you
Shorty wrecked my mind up at Pepperdine
Yo the A K A's and them Deltas fine

Fool coming in an hour we bouncin' at Howard
Yo I ain't no coward so shorty get louder
No folks shake at Norfolk State
Please believe me Tuskegee, the breezies be feenin' me

They need me that Action that Jackson
Man satisfaction when class in
Don't cha know no good at the Oakwood
Could a duck get stuck if my luck that good

Usually they'll say at U C L A
Oooooh you so great Nick Cannon please stay
Got me shiverin', quiverin', don't know what to do
Oooh, little mama I'm scared of you, uhh

[Chorus: x2]</pre>
