198-, 19-, 1986 is when the shit came through
I remember well, I bet you remember too
Back in the days before the dope came in
Niggas wasn't doin nothin then but just hangin
All of a sudden the shit got deep
Niggas said, 'Fuck school, let's hit the streets'
Then the shit started lookin sloppy
Every hood in the city had a motherfuckin posse
Niggas kickin up dust over colors
Ridin through the hood shootin up each other
Sellin dope to they own fuckin people
But they didn't give a damn cause the game had 'em evil
Now the shit is gettin outta hand
It's 1993 and here come the fuckin lawmen
Now it's time to have law and order
Cause you sold a 50 pack to the white man's daughter
And the bitch OD-ed on the crack
Now these damn fools out to kill every fuckin black
But that was the plan from the get-go
Keep the niggas down, don't let 'em have shit, though
But fuck that shit, we ain't takin it
Cause bein broke niggas just ain't makin it
So we do what we can to survive
Even if it means takin these white motherfuckers' lives
But now I turn the gun on my brotherman
Cause he wanna show his ass like the other man
You got some money and now you think you livin good
You still just a nigga from the hood
But don't forget where you came from
It's po' folks like us who made you what you was
( ? ) 4 Deep won't sell out
We still kick it on the cut smokin the weed and drinkin a 40 ounce
We was down from the start
