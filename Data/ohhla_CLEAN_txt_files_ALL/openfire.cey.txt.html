[PHATT DOGG]
I witnessed prop 187 before 911 accused wanna choose another for retaliation
revenge a dish served cold and nurture hatred 
millions spent on war to feed bombs on starving nations
foreign policies overseas drumming up sanctions
democracy threatens the country with annihilation
and I aint got to go that far lets stay domestic
Katrina came and went while you stood by and do nathan
positioning your new world order for our protection
with big brother on every corner watching for terrorists
so is Bin Laden on the run here in America
right now with Bush blowing kush plotting on scaring us
to me the Taliban is the governments thats been leading us
I was told not to eat of the fruit that they been feeding us
decievin us reasoning bloodshed with lies to that I close my eyes
use mouth to open minds 

[CHORUS-RAS CEYLON]
Open Fire if you ever snitch to police
Open Fire then you take the mark of the beast
Open Fire everyday its blazing in the streets
Open Fire burning out all my enemies

It's for my rudeboy Rastas revolutionary shottas
thuggin hiphoppers who don't love the coppers
InI gotcha a proper new offer stand with the truth or your branded 
imposter no weapon shall prosper against the peoples honor
and the streets are getting hotter Oakland to Santa Ana
on the corner I warn ya u really not free
all of police is straight Nazis
but they cant stop we prophecy be revealing
open fire policy means squeezin on the heathens
like target practice then market the tactics
go to war like Sellasie against Italian facists
I'm at this and active in the conflict
tryna make Bush hang like Sadaam did
the fires big and stays blazin worldwide
Unity is strength and this is how we ride

Open Fire if you ever snitch to police
Open Fire then you take the mark of the beast
Open Fire everyday its blazing in the streets
Open Fire burning out all my enemies

[RICHPORT THE SAVIOR]
My brother passed me the torch Ima burn down the courts
in memory of the souljahs who paid the cost
dismember the game shake down and extort
we send em the flames and take down the boss
hunting season for the beast green light on police
see the whites of their eyes open fire never cease
pop off as much as you need ammunition is cheap
got plenty for the demons who put bulletholes in biggie's jeep
livin in the west we never rest hardly sleep
hella haters out here success is hard to keep
everybody on the street eatin off the same tree
and there aint no code of honor and no loyalty
while we link with hungry bros and hoodlum west with junes beats
cuz who we are is what you get and what you see
lion hearted rasta kings itraits and fatigues
yellin ya basta steady firin off these

Open Fire if you ever snitch to police
Open Fire then you take the mark of the beast
Open Fire everyday its blazing in the streets
Open Fire burning out all my enemies

[WARBUX]
Drop this from mile high let it fall right out of the sky
mark one in your heart another sound gone die
mile high me shoot me arrow far wide
inside me nozzle something make your momma cry
man dont want peace he want piece he want war
man dont want cease he want beef he want more
hungry is my ghetto come kicking it down the door
I have not forgot what these guns get hot for
your family rich my family poor
your family snitch my family sure
all ghetto youths salute the culture
21 guns one horse me times 4
mile high we shootin outta the sky
outside of the nozzel well fire ago fly</pre>
