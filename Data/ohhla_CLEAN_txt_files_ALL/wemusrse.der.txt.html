(Intro)
We Shall We Will 
We Must Rise Again
 
(G-Whizz) 
When trouble comes along the way
Tomorrow bring brighter day
So don't stay down, get up now
 
Cause we all got our role to play
To make this world brighter place
So don't give up, stand up now
 
(Bunny Rugs)
No matter what we say
It doesn't take a pain away
But we say cause we care
 
(Junior X)
Somewhere someone is crying out
across the miles I hear them shout
 
(Duane Stephenson)
Now it's steps inclined 
Lift our souls and minds
Time we turn to the one and say
 
We Shall We Will 
We Must Rise Again
x2
 
(Anthony Que)
I hear the voice of children calling in the wind
Can't turn my back, it's an SOS I wanna see them smile again
 
(Ginjah)
I see the world is heading for changes
So many feel pressure, feeling all these pains
 
(Gyptian)
No one knows what may come
We gotta give thanks for the shining sun
Now it's steps inclined 
Lift your souls and minds
Time we turn to the one and say
 
(Everybody)
We Shall We Will 
We Must Rise Again
x2
 
(Lukie D)
God said we should lend them a hand
We will do whatever we can
Brothers together we stand
Hearing your call, showing we care
 
(Cherine Anderson)
Hand in hand my brother, together we are strong
Where there's a will, we'll find a way to carry on
 
(Ghost)
Oh, oh
Somewhere someone is crying out
across the miles I hear them shout
 
(Bushman)
Now it's steps inclined 
Lift your souls and minds
Now we turn to the one and say
 
(Everybody)
We Shall We Will 
We Must Rise Again 
x2
 
(Chevaughn)
Now it's steps inclined 
Lift your souls and minds
Now we turn to the one and say
 
(Everybody)
We Shall We Will 
We Must Rise Again
