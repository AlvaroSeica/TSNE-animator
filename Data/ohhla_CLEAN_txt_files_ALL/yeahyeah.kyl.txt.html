Ok, this is DJ Dick-In-Ya-Mouth
And this is D-A-Y-1 FM, 102.9 on ya radio dial
And we looking for the real freak right now
I'm gon take my first call
First caller, you on the air
(hey man, you think you could play that
New Kyleon for me mayn)

[Kyleon]
I make a bitch say yeah, like Ush' and Jon
I like to put it in they face, when I bust my gun
It's big dick'ing over here, I can touch your lungs
And when it come to bad bitches, I done fucked a ton
Day 1 Fam playa, Kyle, Mack and Pretty Tony
We take niggaz bitches, you looking pretty lonely
You say you a pimp, but you looking pretty phony
I heard your chick eat dick, and she looking pretty hungry
Got bitches that'll dome me, all the way in Wyoming
Cause the whip so clean, and the shoes so chromey
Stop fucking with me homie, unless you ready to die
Cause my bullets like pilots, they ready to fly
And if you ready to buy, Killa got that work
I got that ki that O-Z, I got that verse
And that number one spot, Killa got that verse
Cause I'm a pimp not a simp, how about that chuuch

(*talking*)
That's what you wanted man
This is DJ Dick-In-Ya-Mouth, mayn
And that was my boy Killa Kyleon man
It ain't over, he got that heat
For the streets man, him and his boy
Dre Day, them Day 1 Fam boys
Over there on that No' drive
What's up Beelow, and all rest of them boys
Dee-Wee and Ron-Wee man, come back
Tell 'em some'ing Kyleon hey, (hey)

[Kyleon]
I'm getting money, continuously
That's why, these niggaz envy a G
Want me to breathe on your track, gon head send me a G
And if the beat sound good, I might do it for three
But, Kyleon can't do it for free
Put yourself in my shoes, would you do it for me
Now you looking, for some shit to start
The only Free I know, host 106 &amp; Park
Mayn, this ain't no video show
You niggaz can't fuck me, I ain't a video hoe
Nooo, it's not finna happen
Before I do that, Killa gon stop rapping
Truth in the booth, there's no more excuses
So all you other whack lil' cats, just useless
Get on your note, go home and regroup G
Why you looking at the General, you need to salute me

(*talking*)
That's right, Killa Kyleon ladies and gentlemen
And this is, W-D-A-Y-1 FM

Tell me some'ing (hey man, that's what I'm
Tal'n bout man, that's the kinda shit I like to hear
