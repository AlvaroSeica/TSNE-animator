Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Who I am, you know has nothing to do with the hair
and the shoes and stuff (even though I like shoes)
But you know it has nothin' to do with that
You Know in what I do, I find out there's a lot of Power in Prayer
so I pray for the people who don't understand me
And I tell you, be honest with you, I pray more now to be understood
No excuse me, to understand then to be understood
I pray now to learn how to love and to be loved
Because God has given me abundance
so you know I don't need God, "these people don't understand me, 
hey think I'm crazy every time I'm on the mic" it's not about that
I pray I understand them so I can talk to them
minister to them even more
You understand what I'm saying?
So I'm just not afraid of, it's no affect
it's immaterial to me because our enemies
are not physical bodies they are actually our family
they don't know it and we don't always know it
But our enemies are not flesh and blood and our problems are not flesh and blood
Even though we think they are
Think they are
Think they are</pre>
