[T-Pop]
Girl shake, that thang for me
Girl shake, that thang for me, yeeah - 2x

[Hook: Cupid - 4x]
Let me know, what's going on lil' mama
Shaking that thang in the club, like you want in that drama

[T-Pop]
Let me, just slide on in
I'm bound to hold bar, plus I'm sipping on gin
I'm a ball-a-holic, up in the party all night
The G's straight showing, so it's on all night
She's a throwed lil' mama, plus I'm loving her style
Girl it's ridiculous, let me see you get wild
Wild with it, wild-y-wild with it
Wild-y-wild with it, like you really don't care
Let me, know lil' mama
These haters up in the club, they don't want no drama
Let me know, lil' mama
These haters up in the club, they don't want no drama
Let me, know lil' mama
These haters up in the club, they don't want no drama
Let me, know lil' mama
These haters up in the club, they don't want no drama

[Hook - 4x]

[Thomas]
Whoa, let me see what's going on lil' mama
If I like the way you shake it, then it's on lil' mama
Can a brother like Thomas, take you home lil' mama
And I ain't mean to scare ya, I'm in a zone lil' mama
I wanna bone lil' mama, so I'm wrong lil' mama
Yeah, that's the number to my phone lil' mama
I'm from a calm lil' mama, so won't you shake it for me
And I like the way you shake it, girl take it from me

[Bunny B]
Say 'Mas, you ever seen a fucking booty bottle
Nipples big, like a fucking nipple off a fucking baby bottle
Booty beating, on her thong
And she mad at me, and that's T-Pop's song
Going hard, in the paint
Talking bout where the weed and the X, and the fucking drank
You's a hoe now hold your neck, dip your back
And stick my fingers and cock, in your crack

[Hook - 4x]

[Mr. Phat]
Mr. Phat want a big fine woman, who be off of the chain
I spit game 24/7, so that's all for the brain
I ain't lying, but I'm about to be on top for a while
Them hoodrats looking for Phat, I leave em flat like flo' tiles
All in the club, and I ain't trying to hide it
Tonight don't just look at the truck, hop in if you bout it iight
Let's see you shake it like a dog, like your hips is connected
I'm trying to show you some love girl, so you gotta respect it

[Cupid]
Ooooh ooooh, yeee-da-da-da-da
You gotta wobbilty, wob-wobbilty
Shake it, shake your thang for me
Wobbilty-wobbilty, shake ya shake your thang for me
Hands on your knees, your hands on your knees
Now bust it up for me, girl bust it up for me
Uh just bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu
Take it to the flo' right now, for me

[Hook - 4x]
