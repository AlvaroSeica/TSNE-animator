(PunchLine)
Who got 'em goin' wild? WordsWorth, PunchLine!
Phone Bills' High, from calling radio request line
I bone mad niggaz girls, so check the stilo
I got beef with they X-Men like Magneto
It's time to reload
I'm tired of hittin' the same hoe
Lay Low
Search for brain like the scarecrow
Rhyme pro-fessio-NAL
Stay Wilin' 
In battles I crush niggaz like 8-Ball stage divin'
Paid from rhymin' keep it grimey
Y'all head of the game, but two steps behind me

(WordsWorth)
It's all about who you know and what you sow you reap it
My thought process is strategic, when I think
Peep It
I got to see it to believe it
And believe it to agree with
Agree with to proceed it
And proceed it to conceive it
Conceive it when I speak it
And I speak 'cause I be it
I be it 'cause I sleep it
And sleep it 'cause I breathe it
I breathe 'cause I eat it
And I eat it then I feed it
I feed it then I breed it
And breed it with who I meet with
I meet with on a sneak tip
On a sneak tip is how I keep it
How I keep it 'cause your peeps even leak greatest secrets

(Hook)
I don't need none of y'all with me
I can stand on my own with out y'all with me
When it's time to go all out, none of y'all with me
When you see me makin' moves, then y'all with me
Let Me Be
