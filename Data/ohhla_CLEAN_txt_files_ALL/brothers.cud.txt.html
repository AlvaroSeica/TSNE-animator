Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: King Chip]
If my niggaz don't fuck wit' you, I don't fuck wit' you
That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em ever play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggaz
I got some bad rich bitches, they my real niggaz
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggaz
My little niggaz love to ride by and spill niggaz
If Yall fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If yall fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta put off a chick call in my trill nigga
I met juke in 92 when we still niggaz
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggaz
Living well me and my niggaz go'n eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Hey yo, all right [x8]
This is how it's supposed to be

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they neva change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin got them sucka niggaz hatin
Started from the pavement, basement Satan,
Couldn't match my claims so they compare me to a mason
Free [?] slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' bout crack or we talkin about blacks?
So for the blunted, then they pickin the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin if it in in the run up
Then they gettin the come up, yup bitch
And they do with the sun up
And this is for my niggaz and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing didn't change was my niggaz

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
I got the niggaz that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know then please hit me
No question no hesitation when it come to own fam dawg,
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If its a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to dennis
Brought me thick and thin 'til we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished
Clothes on our kids
And keep my niggaz from goin away on a bid
Only wanted fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggaz up so [?] it they go blind about it
We all grown, families up on our own
Providing for 'em real niggaz, real morals that's the code
So long as I am my brotha's keeper
He will provide me with a [?] or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggaz is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggaz
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad my nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
