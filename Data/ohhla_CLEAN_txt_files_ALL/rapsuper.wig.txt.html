[Shawn Wigs]
I'm laid up in the coconut bath, half baked, off the blueberry
Me and Miss Cherry forever
You little Pee-Wee, I be all over the TV
Neat, fifty cent deep, I break change
Caramel thoughts, and my glass be stained
Your girl got burnt, cuz my dick shoot flames
Sponsored by Louis Vaton, I rock frames
L.V. belt, plasma TV's
Baby blue leather in the brand new Mercedes
I'm gutter, shit, I want a custom made hostler
Sheets in the walls, and my room re a poster
And Enterprise jacket, bulletproof wallet
Ghost told me, we gon' build Spacely Sprockets
Elroy the God, meetings with Clive Davis
The Lord's movie scripts, I need a few pages
Slush puppy bracelets...
Aiyo, it's Theodore, we score like Sinatra in Vegas
I'm going be a rap superstar and live large
Smoked out my brains, pimped out my cars
Stay out in the streets, but don't trust nobody
Sawed off shotgun, hand on my shotty...</pre>
