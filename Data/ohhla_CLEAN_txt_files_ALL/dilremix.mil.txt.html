Look
I got some game for you Chickens
Listen a minute, please
'Case you be stuck with them (Shhh)
Hit you up then they leave
You gotta stop for a minute
Watch for a minute, breathe
Take you a squat for a minute
Listen to what I speak
I'm tryin to keep it real
Not tryina make a scene
You tryina keep your man
You gotta make him scream
You gotta put it down
Drop it and dip it low
Wind it around a while
Stop 'n now let it go

(Christina)
Says he wants you
He says he needs you
It's real talking when I make him wait for you
If he really wants you
If he really needs you
Really got to have you
Take your time and feel him out
When it's a good boy
I mean a really really good boy
Why not let him lay with you?
That's when you give it to him good

Dip it low
Pick it up slow
Roll it all around
Poke it out, Let your back roll
Pop t'pop t'pop that thing
Imma show you how to make your man say "Ohh"
Dip it low
Pick it up slow
Roll it all around
Poke it out, Let your back roll
Pop t'pop t'pop that thing
Imma show you how to make your man say "Ohh"

You getting warm
He growin' cold
It's just the symptoms of young love
Growin' old
You think it's time
And you're thinking of leaving, but give it time
It's late at night
He's coming home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hair
Let him know it's on
If you understand me
Y'all come on

All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move (mooove)
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you want to do (show her what you got, daddy)

All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move (mooove)
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you want to do (show her what you got, daddy)
All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you want to do (ooooh woo oooh)

Dip it low
Pick it up slow (ohhh)
Roll it all around
Poke it out, Let your back roll
Pop t'pop t'pop that thing
Imma show you how to make your man say "Ohh" (Imma show you how to make him)
Dip it low (ohhh)
Pick it up slow
Roll it all around
Poke it out, Let your back roll
Pop t'pop t'pop that thing
Imma show you how to make your man say "Ohh"

(Shawnna)
Look, I got 'em diggin' me
Feelin the way I groove wit it
And know it's killin' me
Thinkin what he could do wit it
He scared of speakin'
He peekin' under that blue fitted
Send me a drink in a blink
He makin' a move wit it
We at the bar sippin'
We on the floor dippin'
We in the car trippin'
We at the crib kissin'
So now it's on
Listen, I can see really what you want
See you wanna pump all in that body but nah
He seen that booty drop
Poke it, now make it pop
Okay now shake the top
Oh baby make it stop
That's what they all say
I could make or brake 'em all day
What you thinkin, got the Jacob, all gray
In the hallway, Powder Room on play
By the rooms, yo, hey
Buy the tunes, I'll stay, Badaboom
See baby boy, Ya killin em, Do your thang
Me and Milian do 'em like Guinness and Boomerang, Yeah

(Christina)
Dip it low
