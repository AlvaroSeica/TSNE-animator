[Verse 1]
We can go blow for blow until we're old and gray
You're flow's openly gay, hope and pray
that your next LP will be ghost wrote by Shay
That's the only way you won't die fruity like Ocean Spray
I prefer you recite them verses
cos most of your shit sound like a throw away
You ain't a pro, you a protégé
This is animal rap, it ain't open mic poetry day
You ain't a solider and no you ain't a trooper
Frontin' like a thug in a Civ when you a geek in a mini cooper
Hooba Shay stay ready for clashin'
My tongue gives out more lashin' than The Passion

[Chorus/Esoteric]
This goes out, to every hungry wanna battle emcee
Workin' full time doin' battle entry
This goes out, to the people that sweating on the game
'til they overload they brain like an overdose on cane
This goes out, to the workin' man streets dollar 
Holler in your ear, sayin' 'fuck George Bush' loud and clear
Get him outta' here, show that cat the door
Cos we don't wanna hear that bullshit no more

[Verse 2]
You can look at this verse as a word to the wise
Realize, open up your eyes
We got people overseas gettin' blown to bits and thrown in a ditch
While Bush is at the game throwin' out the openin' pitch
Double vision blurred, strugglin' with words
Like Fox news tryin' to pronounce the names of, Arabic Kurds
His staff is absurd
Fucking chicken, not battle pride; them cats ain't served
On the real it's true, I'd of dodge a draft too
But see, I don't want what them muthafuckas do
They, all talk like Republican radio
Really only right-winger I support's Cam Neely

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
ES, that's what they call him
Schizophrenic like Sméagol and Gollum
How can we stall em? Rappers keep fallin'
Y'all are off track like skiin' through a slalom
Read the column, mark obituary 
Flick through every man I slay, Shay's still a visionary
Who loves women, knows what bitches need
Good sex and bump shoes like Richard Reed
I gel with rebellious minds
who held time on the frontlines a month at a time
Peace to mankind, y'all can quote this rhyme
I'm well read like a book with a broken spine

[Chorus]</pre>
