Gotcha (crooks!!) 
Must be out your god damn mind (non stop action!!)
Thinking you gonna stop us (you cant stop the crooks!!)
Cause we got the crooks (crooks!!) here (here!!) all (all!!) year (year!!)
Gotcha!!

[Suede]
Yo cracking out the sky rainbow six mobile bubble gum 
Hitting Harlem handles as it drizzles in my chocolate bum
Smoking Sacramento with my doja blowing out the leaves
Kansas City special on the side crooked autos  ???

[Cheeba]
Yo hand specialties retro revolvers
Toros raging bull raging hornet
Sweet scarlet tough guy squeal when he's cornered
Hasn't any arms any armor

[Suede]
A mercury window might give you whiplash
Mademoiselle a carousel practicing witchcraft
Electric acid or Kodak matches a hazard
Sasperrella jazz magic meander panda upon a savage
Amazing prototype Dolomite satellite my might 
In flight might ship shift on your two vivid nights
Left some stretched arm along pawn sexed on
Hopscotch moon rocks lavender pony capricorn

[Cheeba]
Grand Theft Auto supremacy broads out the car Lo
Unload exhaust out the Quattro
Just in case the pigs come in range and the cotch blow
A little painless stainless steel 

Gotcha!! (We need crooks on deck!!)
Must be out your god damn mind (tell me what bank is next!!)
Thinking you gonna stop us (here we go!!)
Cause we got the crooks (crooks!!) here (here!!) all (all!!) year (year!!)
Gotcha!!

[Cheeba]
Whole lot of things lots of banks got
Crooks gotta flame power train Mazdas
We're here man, just a matter of ticks before we conquer

[Suede]
Winners take all
Wild horses mud slides slim snow creatures in the fall through my magic doors
Star dust seven, me and Cheeba handing and no minor oceans eleven
Waving the falcon raven

[Cheeba]
Only one higher law code
Remington fire bar low
Amazing grace when we tazing vault  
Talk about hault must be crazy
Minute men in and out hit again quote 
Langston Hughes when we casing
Racing from Euro to Peking close
To catching us, but no cigar

[Suede]
Just an avalanche eagle flying through the desert 
Hitting on two caravans then we shallow grants 
So you reaching but you had no chance
Stilly the part of the Harley Marley breathing at the twilighters
High life Vega still steaming

Gotcha!! (we need crooks on deck!!)
Must be out your god damn mind (tell me what bank is next!!)
Thinking you gonna stop us (here we go!!)
Cause we got the crooks (crooks!!) here (here!!) all (all!!) year (year!!)
Gotcha!!</pre>
