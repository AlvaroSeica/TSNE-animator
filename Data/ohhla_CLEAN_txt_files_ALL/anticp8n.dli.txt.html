[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
she shined like when a diamond hits the right angle
very hard to find like a dope sample
she was the stuff that dreams are made of, a nightmare
intoxicating smell and a club full of beer
we spent years lookin' for a soul mate, it's fate
I spent years diggin in the crates
relate to her like music
avoiding the typical quotes
I stepped to shorty with a fresh note
could barely get a word out of my throat
I'm just honest
all black triple five like I'm Amish
of the nonsense, I'll reach you in your sub-conscious
paint you a pretty picture, I'm an artist
you see, baby on this planet I'm a man
but in my dreams I'm a king with acres of land
I need a queen by my side, love
It's kinda bug, how we stood there for a minute
but then times up
so then my heart start beatin', like the day I was born
hell there's no fury like a woman's scorn
I'm not a player spittin game, baby I spit flames
got no hidden agenda, won't treat you like loose change
[it's strange when I'm real like that)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
sippin on juice I stared in amazement
she glow like the rocks on her bracelet
I froze and continued conversation
we was alone on the island of temptation
my motivation was sparked by the talk
she barked about brothers that had broken her heart
was stalked by a nigga that was doin her wrong
told her it's not a record, it's a sad song
It's those things we go through that make us strong
don't worry about a thing, then I touched her arm
and everything was calm
I'm not like the rest let the vibe go on
the night was young we kept movin'
the DJ was hot, kept the spot groovin'
stuck on all her movement, she danced, I watched
erotically while brothers gave her props
I stopped, and thought about the women I've been with too
I ain't never felt the way that I've felt with you
and it's like magic and I don't understand it true
but sometimes you fall in love, that's the truth

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
blew me a kiss, that was it then bounced
never got a name, or a phone at the house
she whispered something in my ear, the music was too loud
her voice was so sweet, her lips, her mouth
I recall her saying something about going down south
tellin' me she in the Allen's when winter come around
starin' right in my face, I drowned in her eyes
holdin' a drink while my hands on her thigh
her beauty was apparent but her ?? was so fly
enough to make a grown man cry
she had style, a smile that could light up a room
a flower that can bloom in December or June
the conversation was too short, she left too soon
swept me off my feet like a broom
I mean, she dress sharper than a harpoon
could never love another, now I'm doomed for life
she was just like one of my rhymes, one of a kind
she was like the ink for my lines
It's amazin' how little time was spent with the love of my life
hopin' that one day she could be my wife, it's trife
