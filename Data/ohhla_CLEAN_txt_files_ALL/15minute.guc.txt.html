[Intro]
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane geah
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane uhh
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane {*2X*}
So Icy E-N-T {*3X*}
It's the kid {*2X*}
It's the kid again {*echoes*}

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Shawty asked me what time it is?
I said it's fifteen minutes past the diamonds bitch
In Laflare, in the cockpit, Gucci the prophet
Bel Air shoppin, West coast hoppin

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci~! Niggaz get popped still not get Cochran
Now ask Josh Avanta{?} or Egalin{?}
Lawyers, doctors, and policemen
Jewelers, Buellers, and co-pilots
My hood life {?} burn the verse like lightning
My flow so frightening, it not nothin nice man
See I shoot bul-lets and you shoot dice man
It's my life man, so I'ma stay {?}
See I'm no red man, and I'm no white man
I don't pay a car check, my Aston Martin
My chain be shinin, my grill be sparklin
It's Gucci darlin, now whassup shawty?

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Shawty so sexy but she be flexin
Oh he ride Lexus, ooh I fly frequent
Oh he pop bottles, then I'm not drinkin
Oh that smell stinkin, is what I'm just thinkin
This whole outside why didn't you make it?
Oh boy you left it, so bitch I bet ya
In and out the Range with a four dollar outfit
Talkin 'bout your man tell him why you a trick bitch
On to the next one, shawty the best one
From Houston, Texas, damn she vibrant
Crushin, blushin, I got her smilin
The sunburnt eyelids, but I'm not whylin
I'm admirin, she perspirin
The way she dancin, has got me risin
Let's go kick it, let's go shoppin
Tear the mall up girl I'm not poppin

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci baby, it's +groovy baby+
The Maybach mango, the inside gravy
My wrist game crazy, connect beez hazy
My 180, the track Fugazi
The black still shady, I know they hate me
The white won't date me, but you won't let up
But you know better, cause you gon' save her
I know you paid her, did her favors
But that's not player, and that's not gangster
My fingers got a pimp {?} cause I'm no banker
See I'm her thinker, battleship sank her
So Icy Entertainment we cuttin off fangers

[Chorus]</pre>
