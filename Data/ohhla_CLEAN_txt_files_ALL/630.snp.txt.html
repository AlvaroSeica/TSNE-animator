[Intro: Wiz]
Fuck~! {*echoes*}
You know a nigga don't wanna go to school today
Let me call this bitch
And get my shit together

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
When I pull up people so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggaz talkin it
But they just don't go harder than us
Keep stuntin just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggaz talkin it
But they just don't go harder than us

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, this one's for the G's
All black Chucks on the cuffs of my jeans
King size pape's stuffed full of trees
I be with the Boss Dogg, y'all fuck niggaz fleas
Now they say I'm hot, hundred-somethin degrees
Takin pictures with a young nigga, cheese~!
Remember days homie I ain't have a thing
Now I'm hoppin off a plane puttin roaches on the wing
... And my hoes like queens
... But we smoke like kings
... Jewelry froze like bling
Money come fast, yours slow like ring{?}
Rollin up grass, sold weed to half the staff
So I know I'm gon' pass
Third period, showin up last
with a late note blowin grey smoke

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
We blow 'til the middle of the day
Wiz say "Dogg, put a little in a J"
Ay, why not? Not why
We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
Fuck it, everybody to the library
Got a new batch, some blue, boo-berry
Stuck in the hallway
with a pass say "Dogg, he can smoke all day"
It's a mind game, like Kareem I seem to keep migraines
Ritchie Valens, and bitch I'm Frankie Ly-mon
I'm so lifted, like a parachuter
My grass, stay off, +Day Off Ferris Bueller+
Slip away, dip away
Almost had to throw a whole zip away
But fuck that, this Taylor Gang
"What you want Dogg?" Shit I'm on everything
Ya dig?

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Talkin all that shit
Never have, never will
You niggaz never have, never will
You niggaz never have, never will
Big Snoop and Wiz smokin killa-kill
I said you niggaz never have and you never will
You niggaz never have and you never will
You niggaz never have and you never will
Big Snoop and young Wiz smokin kill kill kill kill kill kill...

Hahaha, yeah
You niggaz still in junior high school
Elementary ass niggaz
Holla at me when you graduate
We'll be posted right by the 400 building, Room 420
Follow your nose, your nose knows
Hahaha

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro: Snoop]
Niggaz ain't hard like us
Niggaz soft as doctor's cotton swabs
You bitch you, smoke somethin
Uh, smoke somethin</pre>
