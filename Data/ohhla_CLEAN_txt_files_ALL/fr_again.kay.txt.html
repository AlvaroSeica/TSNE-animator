[Intro: Sample from "Free Again by Barbara Streisand] (Fat Joe)
Free again, back to bein free again
Back to bein me again (HELLO!!!!)
With all my precious freedom (IT'S COCA THE DON NIGGA!!!)
My precious, precious freedom

[Female Background Singers] (Fat Joe):
FREE!!! OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!
OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!! (AIYYO SLAY!!!!)
FREE!!! OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!! (I TOLD YOU I GOT YOU MY NIGGA!!!)
OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!! (*And you say New York City)

[Chorus: Sample from "Incarcerated Scarfaces" by Raekwon]
I move rhyme like retail make sure shit sell, from where we at on my man's cell 
I move rhyme like retail make sure shit sell, from where we at on my man's cell

[Verse One: Fat Joe]
Straight outta Cell 12 where  hell fell on my lap
A nigga was born to rap 'bout drug tales and all the rats
This is for Chef Jr., now that's Italiana
Chicken Parmesan and bocce with my paesanas
I told my ex 'sana I'll die with my honor paesana
Six bad bitches some marijuana where Garga can find us
And you could see the pictures and the scriptures that these bitches sent me
Hopped in the Ghost, my wiz jumped in the sister Bentley
When Suge had the Row (Row) Jay start the Roc (Roc)
I was in the cars bustin off fuck the cops
With the killer cross, had Iverson on the block
Graced the cover of The Source, tell me that ain't hot
When in for RICO, kilos, wish they gave me the max
Fuck them C.O.'s, and C-hos for hatin' on crack
Four months on the toilet shit, I can do that
Came with thirty, left with three, now how the fuck he do that?
Most these niggas in the fed shoulda been in the state
Off to Texas to Brazil, now we raisin' the stakes
I seen Gordouli, know that nigga big like Chapo
Shout out to you-know-who, let me fuck in the chapel
S-I-S shit for sale, first thing in the mornin
Tried to send me to the SHU for the fresh pair of Jordans
I had a thing for the secretary, wassup Ms. Jordan?
All that ass in them pants had you feelin important
Left with J's on my feet, J's, {J-J's on my feet}
Straight out the cage, sun raised on the beach
And I ain't got to lie, my son raised on the beach
Crib with the elevator, Gabe on the piece

[Chorus: Female Background Singers]
FREE!!! OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!
OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!
FREE!!! OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!
OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!

[Sample from "Incarcerated Scarfaces" by Raekwon]
I move rhyme like retail make sure shit sell, from where we at on my man's cell 
I move rhyme like retail make sure shit sell, from where we at on my man's cell

[Verse Two: 50 Cent] (*Female Background Singers)
Gun tote, move dope, niggas know my repertoire
Bulletproof smart car level six A.R.
Cocktail Molotov burn heat turn heat
Revolve, cock bang revolve, it's off
Cocaine medadine codeine better lean
The fuck out my way drive the bricks down the highway
It's anthem when I rant fuck you think I am Kanye?!
I had them wearin vest's, now these niggas wear dresses (HA!!!)
(*FREE!!!) I take it back to the essence
Free of charge a nigga so large these niggas is stressin I bless 'em
(*FREE!!!) Pounds of purple the profits precise
With precision we'll move you up to pills you get that right
Money motivation, this bread in the basket
Go 'head say somethin 'bout while you gettin your ass kicked
Niggas back on that New York bullshit
My lil' man post up in the back with a full clip, he let it off

[Chorus: Female Background Singers]
FREE!!! OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!
OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!
FREE!!! OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!
OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!

[Sample from "Incarcerated Scarfaces" by Raekwon]
I move rhyme like retail make sure shit sell, from where we at on my man's cell 
I move rhyme like retail make sure shit sell, from where we at on my man's cell

[Outro: Sample from AZ]
And you say New York City! And you say New York City!

[Sample from "Free Again by Barbara Streisand]
Free again, back to bein free again
Back to bein me again 
With all my precious freedom, my precious, precious freedom</pre>
