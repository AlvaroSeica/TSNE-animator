[Napoleon]
They call me Valentine, I bag up a thousand viles of dimes
Poison ivy, nigga, grab the Cali nine
A pal of mine just came back, with the Island shine
The nigga wild as grime, he keep a pile of nines
Italian style designs, medallions found in prime
This battallion drop heat, and the stallion's wine
For having childish minds, I murder trials refined
Jew lawyers giving up, they saw the smile and signs
Crystals and wines, we travel miles with vines
I'm the nigga from the hood that you dial for crimes
I'm agile with mines, fragile rewind
Stay low key, I profile in time
Purple Maybachs, AKs, macks
I clean out a nigga lab like Ajax
Spray tracks, with the tommy gun melody
15 of my bars, 21 felonies
Green sheets, sit back and listen, to the king speak
I seen Greece, brains get blown, on Queens street
I'm grimey, rugged like the bottom of a fiend's feet
Rob so much, you will think my whole team's Greek
Like Athena, fuck O's, we snatch ninas
And tag teams is up in the trunk of black Beemers
Relax FIMA, ten and a half I will stand off
Got you all facing forty, a fifty grand loss
Got my mans searching the land, for the tan soft
Check us out of fortune cookies, by Japan bars
Rams toss, when I see crown victorious
Move like the piper shot ass, pound by Florida
What up Lonnie, I know you got the pearl handle
Ruger, that blows through intruders like Earl Campbell
It's the G code, aiyo my heat rolls
Used to throw brick like Shaq free throws
But now life's better, rubies and nice sweaters
Everything is cool like night weather
In Buffalo, we sheisty enough, handcuff a hoe
Two hundred and fifty eight grams, just enough to blow

[Chorus 2X: Napoleon]
Pussy niggas fronting with dough, we snatch 'em up
Grabbed up, tape and ball roll, and wrap 'em up
Don't wanna give up your dough, we smack 'em up
Kidnap his wife and his seeds, and clap him up

[Tree]
Aiyo Po, he got a couple of bricks, that we gon' stick him up
You ain't gotta ask me twice, I'mma hit him up
And no I'm not 2Pac, but when the beef on
I ride with the mask, a hammer plus two glocks
Look we gon' cut the lights out, and butt 'em with a couple of clips
Then knock his light out
I heard he got the new bricks and a couple six in
Moving 'caine on the street, this nigga had me flipping
This nigga had me ripping, I'mma run in his house
Run in his mouth, and put like ten in his spouse
Yeah, you know I be flipping hard, I be dicking broads
Leave, I leave 'em stunk out, dog, in the fucking yard
And you ain't gotta ask me if I'm with it
Cuz when I see the money, I just spray and go and get it
Aiyo, it's Tree, I'm selling that shit, you get knocked
With that D and start telling that shit, you yelling and shit
How you in the backyard stomped out
Leaking on your butt, your body all smelling and shit
Look, you don't gotta know my name, revolver, you know my flame
Hustling, go and get it, sell it, yeah, you know my game
Young nigga bust a flame, trapped out, in the streets
Dog, I leave you clapped up, wrapped out, in the streets
Yeah, I'mma take the loot, yeah, I'mma take the coup
Run up on his block with a glock, and co-take his stoupe
Soon as he run at his mouth, I'mma cock and shoot
Then and start running his pocket, then take his loot
Yeah, I'mma take his chain, yeah, I'mma take this dame
Run up in his mouth, once pack, I'mma take his 'caine
Niggas keep running and shit, they won't take a thing
Tree here running your gun, and co-brick your flame
Nah, I don't give a fuck, yeah, I be moving 'caine
Yeah, I be pushing truck, yeah, I be moving shit
Yeah, I'm out for bucks, Tree know you front as fuck
If you keep running your mouth, I leave you in a tux
Yeah, yo, they call me Tree, move 'caine, sell to D
Breeze through Mahogy V, yeah, I be shitting, huh
see ya niggas grittin' huh, leave you niggas mittin' huh
Know I got that cook in the oven, pies in the kitchen huh
Know my young nigga Po, rollin' on a mission, huh
Yeah, this a mission, huh, yeah, you need to listen, huh

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
