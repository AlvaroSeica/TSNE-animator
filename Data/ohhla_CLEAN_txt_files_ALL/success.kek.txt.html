(*talking*)
You know, a trash can get a steak sometimes
Nigga like us come around every so often mayn

[Chorus]
When they was thinking failure, I was thinking success
When they was saying he aiight, I was saying I'm the best
But now I'm living carefree, niggaz wishing me stress
I'm a ghetto inspiration, bitch I'm looking like success
They use to tell me no, now all I'm hearing is yes
When they was saying I'm cursed, I was saying I'm blessed
I kill these niggaz slowly, did it all with finesse
I'm a ghetto inspiration, bitch I'm looking like success

[Lil' Keke]
Up early in the morning, bout to take a trip to court
I gotta stand strong, family gone no support
It take a real man, to fall back and understand
To take a fall and lose it all, really wasn't the plan
These niggaz steady talking, my name stay in the press
A ghetto inspiration, who was taught to do the best
I dealt with the stress, and done it for so long
I stay going hard, when niggaz was going home
Was raised in the streets, and hustled when it was slow
I still had faith, when people was saying no
A G stayed strong, turned my losses to wins
You never need a enemy, fucking with fake friends success

[Chorus]

[Cal Wayne]
I'm looking like success, and so I walk with my fitted cocked
Chest swolled up, pants sagging while I ditty-bop
Niggaz put they mask on, and pose in something they really not
You don't like me now nigga, just wait till I get really hot
Lord knows, my dudes been paid and a lil' extra
Made some'ing outta nothing, sometimes I feel special
Was really ten toes in the streets, I had to wrestle
But I'm still strapped, cause I gotta be careful
I'm flying down the freeway, tripping saying God good
Trials and tribulations, partnas snaking but I fall through it
Ke had a dream to be the king, and so I saw to it
Nothing is impossible, whenever I put my heart into it (God's good)
He say your time coming, so I start getting prepared
But feel guys bumping, I feel it in the air
I kick my feet up, and roll some'ing and lit the square
My hard work done paid off, my grind is gonna get me there

[Chorus]

[Black]
I'm looking like success, my mama think I'm successful
So that's my motivation to make it, I hustle extra
They say I'm some'ing special, my story heard by the masses
Trapper turned rapper, I never would have imagined
Music is my passion, so hopefully I'll be blessed
See 106 &amp; Park, and do shows out on the West
Again I'm in the hood with them goods, busting some moves
Saving me a penny on winning, while y'all lose
Ain't so any dudes, are damn near saying fuck it
I'm real and I rap, so the ghetto can't help but love it
A verse up outta Jigga, three thousand a pro say
I can say I made it then, my family is ok

[Chorus]</pre>
