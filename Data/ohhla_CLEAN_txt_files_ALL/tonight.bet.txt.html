[Intro]
Okay, okay, grown folks music bein played right now
Put the children in bed, alright?
This song goes out to all of you that blame 
every child you ever had on me
I know cause I'm meeting all these lil' kids name Betty Wright
After "Tonight is the Night", heh..

[Chorus] 
Light up a candle 
We got business to handle 
It feels like.. tonight again 
Light up a candle 
We got business to handle 
It feels like.. tonight again 

[Verse One: Betty Wright]
We been taking, it kinda slow 
Cause we wanna be sure 
how far we should go, oh... 
Said I wanna know, cause I been here before 

[Chorus] 

[Verse Two: Betty Wright]
No-no-no-no, I'm not scared this time (I'm not scared)
Cause I'm a woman and uh, I've crossed that line 
But I'm just as excited, mmm 
But you can't come in unless you're invited 

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Betty Wright]
I ain't acting shy 
So don't be acting coy 
I ain't no little girl 
You ain't no little boy 
We know what we wanna do 
Time's a-wasting boo..
(Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!) 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh..

[Outro: Betty Wright]
Tonight again, tonighth again
Tonight again, yeah..
Ooooooh, it feels like tonight again
Ooh, It feels better the second time 
Sho' feels better the second time 
Umm, don't matter what little Betty Wright said 
That was then this is now, and I say 
Sho' is better a second time around, yeah.. 
A little knowledge that you can't get in college  
Lessons that you learned from me, not from the university, no 
Oooh-oooh-oooh, yeah
Oooh-oooh-oooh, it feels like
Oooh-oooh-oooh, feels like
