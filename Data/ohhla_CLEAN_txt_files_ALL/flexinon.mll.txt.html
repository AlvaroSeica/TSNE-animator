[Intro]
HAH~! Yeah
MMG nigga
WOOP! WOOP!

[Meek Mill]
Stuntin on my old hoes, stylin on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Glock 10 with that laser, fuck around meet yo' maker
Herme' got me pissin, fuck around with them papers
so I can't smoke no kush, I can't smoke no kush
But I run through them hoes, and I ain't talk 'bout Reggie Bush
I say y'all fuck niggaz so fold, hoes ain't never gon' look
In the kitchen with that Pyrex and a 9 piece, let me cook
Now hold up - I went and bought a Phantom cause I wanted to
And now I drive the same one some stunnin do
Real nigga (real nigga) hundred proof (hundred proof)
I'mma need a hundred M's to make me comfortable

[Chorus]
Stuntin all on my old hoes, stylin all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a hundred racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin, flexin, flexin on these niggaz
I be flexin, flexin, flexin on these bitches
I be flexin, flexin, flexin on these niggaz
I be flexin, flexin, flexin on these bitches

[Meek Mill]
All I know is just flex, shittin on my ex
Bad hoes on my team, dick 'em down like next
I rock YSL so fresh, fly as hell no jet
Waves on 360, make that pussy get so wet
Ah - she say I'm cocky, I say that's not me
She call me papi, and I say "ven aqui"
Wrist wear on hockey, Porsche box like Ali
My sneaks they bally, in my hood I'm probably
just rollin 'round in that ghost, watchin out for them folks
Heater on my hip, trunk full of that work
I say my shooters like Dirk, ten racks and you murk
I put that on yo' head nigga, first week and you dead nigga
Ah - I bottle pop, I model pop
Pull up on them bikes, let the throttle pop
Niggaz know I'm nice, and I got a lot
Like fuck yo' corner (nigga) I buy the block

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
I don't chase no bitches (flexin) I just chase my dreams (flexin)
We - ridin 'round so dirty in this whip that's so clean
My - old head she dirty but that dick suck so mean
And that pussy just so good for that pipe she my fiend
On that pint I just lean, perk got me bent
If you ain't talkin 'bout money, you ain't got no sense/cents
Smell it on my clothes, work got that scent
In that kitchen with them birds, 'bout to serve up that's din'
Hold up! OZ's and whole keys, straight white and no trees
Great white and OZ's and they might just O.D.
I stay tight with O.G.'s, they know I'm real nigga
Pocket full of them racks and my bank account Meek Mill nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
