[Verse 1]
Adams
I heard justice was blind when Uncle Sam fucked her
I heard she came when he whispered he loved her
Young and naieve she thought nothing of it
And respecting her, he thought nothing of it
I just want to get my point across like Jezus
So I look to the sky like Hey Zeus
You got answers, Cause I got questions
Fold my arms peep the clouds and recieve lessons
First we stopped stressin
Then we learned mathematics and we helped blessings, God
At the age of 10 I pickud up the pen
Fire's pretty and they burns and I learned they're thin
After school we were slap box
And my man Terance he had jokes of whoever had loos sox
See I'ma win this battle
And later tonight your girl's gonna hear my love rattle
Yes niggas it's dark outside
It's so could your time time a died

[Chorus]
You don't wanna dance with me, cause you a fake
Cause I can do the wop and the snake
And mess around and chance my best steps
Everytime the beat brakes

You don't wanna dance with me, you a fake
Cause I can do the wop and the snake
And mess around and chance my best steps
Everytime the beat brakes

[Verse 2]
It was asked before Lopez
Her name was Taiwanda
she went to IS 238
Suzane B Anthony
We called it B Tony
If you class of '92 you should know me
Jamaica High, that was my first cipher
Everyday we slamed the mic like Bill Holiday with a rose in her hair
At 6th grade my favorite wrestler was Rick Flair
Remember Lee Patches and the Playboy ten tops
And if you don't you could get figured for a leglock
If I was 12 I would backspin on you
Shill 5 saterday morning karate
This is win every videogame was 8 bit
And you would get popped in your mounth for talking shit
I wrote this rhyme thinking of 50 Cents and Ashy Elbows
Summertime nights and stairin out the window
And if you hear gunshots you gonna hear a widow
Cryin' five seconds a part like thunder and lightning
(Know what I'm sayin, just put your feet on ice)

[Chorus]
You don't wanna dance with me, cause you a fake
Cause I can do the wop and the snake
And mess around and chance my best steps
Everytime the beat brakes

You don't wanna dance with me, cause you a fake
I can do the wop and the snake
And mess around and chance my best steps
Everytime the beat brakes

[Verse 3]
Just me and my peers spittin' raps for years
Sight for sour eyes, sound for sour ears
Where I'm from they be like "Where your coat black?"
All I find the key in 10 seconds flat
So I wouldn't do that, no
Let me rephrase don't go there
And you can not hold air
Some of us knuckle up some got the shaddy
Some do the Roger Rabbit with Jers in the lobby
And when the 5 O show the van
They do the runnin' man
I could never choos a side
Until I saw the hustler's electric slide</pre>
