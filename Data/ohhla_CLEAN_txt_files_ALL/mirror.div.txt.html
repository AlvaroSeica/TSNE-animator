Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Looking in the mirror everyday I get older
Learn from the past everyday I get stronger
I like to get high, but it's great to be sober
Yesterday was hard, but it made me a soldier
You don't get nothing if you don't work hard
You can't earn stripes if you never had scars
There's way more to life then money and nice cars
You are who you are, you might be a bum
You could be a star, you might be a prisoner fighting behind bars
You trying to find peace, I'm a try to find God
You searching for your destiny we trying to find ours
The blood in my hearts pumping for the the right cause
And I get that same feeling when I hear that old Nas

[Verse 2]
You said the world was ours just gotta play your part
Shoot for the stars like you trying to hit Mars
Shine in the dark and I bet you'll never lose
Glanced in the mirror and I'd seen I had to the twos
Awake to my ways still I'd rather hit snooze
Can't fuck with the news let the channels flip through
Put us in a cage with the habitat dude
Try to break us down like we handicap fool
Fish out of water like we vandicamp dude
Nobody supposed to eat if the family can't move

[Verse 3]
And the family can't lose, as long as we got each other
As long as we are loyal, as long as we are brothers
I called my pops the other day to tell him that I love him
For giving me the opportunity to make it out the gutter
A lot of us was fortunate to even have a mother
A lot of us got intuition that we ain't discovered
A lot of us got fears that we need to overcome
We done seen too many tears fall underneath the sun
Don't wanna see no blood shed over the years to come
So we praying up to heaven hoping that he is the one
When times getting nearer, the skys getting clearer
You searching for the truth that God's in the mirror
Deep down inside pass the lies that you hearing
Open up your heart to the light and the spirit
Despite the appearance have courage and pride
It's survival of the fittest only for the wise and the fearless
Loves the emotion, vibe to the lyrics
Years down the line I'll probably cry when I hear this
Embrace who I am, never try to be different
Mama seen the king and my eyes is the infant
Started off small, little guy on the benches
Fighting so long I felt like I was in the trenches
Destined for greatness, divine intervention
Discover who you are the fine leap of mention
The mirror
