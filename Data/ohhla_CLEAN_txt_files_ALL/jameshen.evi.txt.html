[Intro]
"What if uh, C-A-T really spelled 'dog'?"
"Uhh.. that's heavy!"

[Chorus: Evidence]
Uh, I'm commission-driven, so pay up
I ain't fuckin up these Dunks or these lay-ups
..And if you see me wearin make-up
The same day you saw Jimi Hendrix wake up
So those that give a fuck, I apoligize
Know my heart is here, never compromised
Those in attendance, I wanna thank ya
And wish this night all night, throw in the anchor

("AS WE PROCEED..."
