Fifty niggaz deep. Fifty niggaz.
I'm fifty niggaz deep. Fifty niggaz.
Fifty niggaz deep. Fifty niggaz.
I'm fifty niggaz deep. Fifty niggaz.
("Check it out, I got some bitches wit' me too though.")
Fifty niggaz deep. Fifty niggaz.   
Fifty niggaz deep. Fifty niggaz.
Fifty niggaz deep. Fifty niggaz.
Fifty niggaz deep. Fifty niggaz.
("This is how I like to ride, feel me on this.")

Yo, I roll wit' nothin' but them pretty bitches ("One."),

Them rich bitches, ("Ten.")
them 'who you callin' bitch?' bitches. ("Eleven.")
Quick to blast bitches, ("Twelve.")
all about the cash bitches. ("Thirteen.")
Them hit-yo'-stash-and-give-it-to-Drunken-Mast bitches. ("Fourteen.")
Live bitches, ("Fifteen.")

Hangin' 'round, give me pussy by the pound bitches. ("Thirty-six.")
Them do-it-all bitches, ("Thirty-seven.")
keep me standin' tall bitches. ("Thirty-eight.")
'You say you ballin', nigga? Meet me at the mall' bitches. ("Thirty-nine.")
On-the-grind bitches, ("Forty.")

'Press rewind if the pussy don't blow ya mind' bitches. ("Forty-two.")
Neat bitches, ("Forty-three.")
them Presidential Suite bitches. ("Forty-four.")

Them double-team bitches, ("Forty-six.")

Menage a trois like it's a mothafuckin' dream bitches. ("Forty-eight.")
Scandelous bitches, ("Forty-nine.")
them bitches in the streets. ("Fifty.")
Now add these bitches up,
I'm fifty, I'm fifty bitches deep.

Drunken Master comin' through with an ill crew.
Fifty niggaz deep and I'm growin' like mildew.
Drunken Master comin' through with an ill crew.
Fifty bitches deep and I'm growin' like mildew.

"I'll tell you what.
Why don't you and your bitches get wit' me and my niggaz
and we can set this mothafucka off Drunkenstyle.
Feel me?"</pre>
