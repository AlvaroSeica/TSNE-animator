[Verse One: Nicki Minaj]
Said he met this little girl by the name of Onika
When my body shake all the boys wanna freak her 
Brag and a boast they be, doin the most
If I, look at his friend he'll be, grippin the toast
So I took him to the crib, to kill him wid it
Put my legs behind my head I hit the ceilin wid it
When I put it in his mouth I couldn't believe it
He looked me in my eyes and said he wanna breed it
Passa passa, you ain't got no ends in mi casa
Big fat pussy, mi fasta 
Hit up Green Acres, hit up Kings Plaza
Some a dem seh dem Gully, some a dem seh dem Gaza

[Verse Two: Wyclef Jean]
She screams, like we in the jungle
Kamasutra she workin from every angle 
Jump in the air and she land and a split
Go from the split now she up on her head
Go from her head now she's layin on her back
Then she waitin for the thuggy thuggy to attack the cat
She tell me lock the door now she wanna get spanked 
+Bedroom Bully+ like the one Shabba Ranks
Do not get scared, signs at the door
She said it's nothin that she wouldn't explore
Then we nah watch no ticky ticky ticky time
Just freak freaky wine and bend back yuh spine
Suss One she's a!!!!

Light up the fire, you know we get higher
Rollin up loud real niggas movin quiet
Like it then I buy it, you donkeys on a diet
Bringin all my jewels I ain't know I start a riot 
Ridin with the blicker, messin up makeup 
You blowin up her phone, she ain't tryin to pick up
Drinkin out the bottle, leanin with a model
I throw a hundred racks up you think I hit the lotto
Ridin with the wolves I ain't talkin Minnesota
Shorty comin over, 'gon bend it over
Let me plank on it (On it) Put a drink on it (On it)
Heard you a freak, put my name on it (MONTANA!!!)
HAAAAA!!!!!
