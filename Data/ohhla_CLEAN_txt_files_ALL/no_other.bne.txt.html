Chorus 1:

You'll never find no other like my kind (like my kind)
Come chill with me and tell me what you see
You'll never find no other like my kind
Boogey man every time
Come chill with me and tell me what you see
You'll never find no other like my kind
Come follow me thug stroll
Come chill with me and tell me what you see
You'll never find no other like my kind
Boogey man every time

Verse 1:

Mo' thugs
From the wasteland running up on you bang
Nigga no one can touch my shit
If you wanna fuck with this
Must you come bang
Mo thugs
From the wasteland running up on you bang
Nigga no one can touch my shit
If you wanna fuck with this
Must you come bang
Leaving things to the real gees
They be rolling with me
Nigga we straight from Cleveland
Everyday we stay thieving
Thugging in your city
U better come play my way
Come get me let's parlay
Ever they knew it
And if I will say do it
Stocking all my thugster way
Bridge
If you love to parlay
Let me see your body swing
Cleveland S.C.Ts
Yes my niggers stay oldie
Mo' thug family
Range from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
Mortality family tree
Thugging with Flesh B.O.N.E
(Yeaaah)

Chorus 2 (2 x)

Come chill with me and tell me what you see
You'll never find no other like my kind
Come follow me thug stroll
Come chill with me and tell me what you see
You'll never find, no other like my kind
Boogey man every time

Verse 2

How funny?
Flesh-N-Bone  bash
Kicking up dust from Cleveland
All over the world wide
We bashing over nasty niggers
Holler for my gun shall blast
Making my chest fit for anything so deadly bang
Nigga you know the game
And you know the name
Mo' thug family need a repair
Bang    bang
I gast to get down for my thing and maintain
Keeping the police I'mma maul them
Still I'm flipping this scripty thing
Come get your thug on
And parlay with the platinum player
Only the peelish g-thing kick it
So play your hide and seek, you play them
Niggers they chasing paper
Making that mighty dollar while you can
Mobbing and balling your man
Niggers they know I'm the man with the master plan
How can I make you understand that
You'll never find no other trues like my kind
Ready fixing that saint claire wig splitters
Boogey man every time
If you heard there
Some of the things l've been through
Get it it's unbelievable
So dabble the fiends and rub it
Before their gangs randomly plead
Try to play a role

HOOK 1

Mortality family tree
Thugging with Flesh B.O.N.E
