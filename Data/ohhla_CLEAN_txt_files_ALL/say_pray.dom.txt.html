[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Golden Child, what it is, baby? Tell me
Que te pasa..

[Dom Pachino]
Aiyo, nunca, you could never fuck with P.
I get it cracking in this bitch, nigga, vente aqui
Represento Staten Island, a hora aqui
Sorta like Sgt. Slaughter, blow my whistle, you'll see
The ugliest, grittiest, shittiest, rocking camo mitters
I'm Fat Cat, giving birth to kittens
Like, strays in the alley, built like we in the rally
Pardon my rudeness, but I'm sincere, when I'm through this
No time to repair, no engineer can cue this
The movement, sorta like the Million Man
Circulate like a ceiling fan
Napalm is the new shit, man, the Team's official
Set it off like a missile
My music get under your skin, like your muthafucking tissue</pre>
