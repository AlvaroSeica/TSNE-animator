[Intro]
Sosa baby, you know I'm rockin baby

Nigga I'm three hunna bang

[Chorus]
I'm coolin with my youngins
And what we smoke one hunna
But nigga I'm three hunna
Click Clack, Pow, now he runnin
Don't be fuckin with my youngins
Them niggas be drummin
They take ya ass down shit we need them bricks or something
Keep this shit one hunna
I keep this shit three hunna
I pull up in that Audi
You pull up in that Honda

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga don't wanna be it
I like my bitch conceited

My gun don't make me beat it
I'm coolin with my young niggas
A lot of kush, a lot of guns nigga

Fuck a tugga gang bitch I'm 3hunna

[Chorus]
I'm coolin with my youngins
And what we smoke one hunna
But nigga I'm three hunna
Click Clack, Pow, now he runnin
Don't be fuckin with my youngins
Them niggas be drummin
They take ya ass down shit we need them bricks or something
Keep this shit one hunna
I keep this shit three hunna
I pull up in that Audi
You pull up in that Honda

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
A fuck nigga don't want that gun play
Set him up have him dead by Monday
Kush blunts in the ash tray
We gettin cash and we get that shit the fast way
I keep that shit 3 hunna
SOD and Young Munna
A fuck nigga don't wanna try me
I'm on the high way 20 pounds of Irene
She like Soulja Boy ya icy
Standin in the club in my white tee
A fuck nigga don't wanna fight me
I'll grab that AK and aim it at his mouthpiece

[Chorus]
I'm coolin with my youngins
And what we smoke one hunna
But nigga I'm three hunna
Click Clack, Pow, now he runnin
Don't be fuckin with my youngins
Them niggas be drummin
They take ya ass down shit we need them bricks or something
Keep this shit one hunna
I keep this shit three hunna
I pull up in that Audi
You pull up in that Honda</pre>
