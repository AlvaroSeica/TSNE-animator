Song:   A Prayer For Everybody/To Be Free
Typed by: [transcribed from jacket sleeve]

This is a prayer for everybody
In the world
'Cause I need you and you need me
We need each other

This is a prayer for everybody
In the world
A prayer for you
A prayer for me
A prayer for love and harmony
A prayer for light for all to see
A prayer that someday we'll all be free

'Cause...
There's a lot that's wrong
We must be strong
And not become bitter
If there's a chance
That mankind will profit
Why should we scoff at something new
Or old - if it can make us better?

This is a prayer for everybody
In the world
'Cause without you
And without me
Without love and harmony
Without courage and dignity
What would it mean
To be free?</pre>
