Song:   Who Gets Your Love
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Makeba Mooncycle]
So I thought things were working out, oh so fine
You came right on time, to occupy my mind
To fill a void, at first, I tried to ignore
Create some space, but I become to adore
You, were acting oh so cool, and oh so true
This new love I had, just had my mind blue
I didn't know someone could be so kind
Is this why they say that love is blind
I was scorned, I was walking on cloud nine
Ready to give myself and ready to shine
Ready to claim this new man is mines
His beautiful smile and he is oh, so, fine
Thought so considerent, and oh so sweet
So much in common, God caused us to meet
What am I to do, I fell fast for you
I fine myself, head over heels for you
He was real given, made me feel complete
Had the nerve to sweep me right off my feet
Anticipated every call waiting for the high to crash and fall
Was that all?

[Chorus 2X: Makeba Mooncycle]
Who gets your love, when you other's man
Who gets your love, is it my friend
I need love, how about you
Now that I'm gone, who's loving you

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Amiri, do you think I'm acting crazy, insane
You think that brother could ever feel the same
I let him know I wasn't playing, any more games
Rugged, treating everyone different and not the same
My doubt, no good benefitting only him
He knew I wanted more, things started looking grim
So what am I suppose to do, being stuck like glue
Hoping that he's the one, and hoping that might be true
I put an H on my chest to handle this love quest
To handle the deal, and take the test
Aggrivated assault, committing a felony crime
Because I let him in my heart, be the death of mine
Impressed, now I'm stressed, to get this off my chest
To him, I fear, can't take no more, what's the deal

[Interlude: Amiri Gamble]
Yo, Makeba, I can't tell you, what, you know
A man gon' be a man, yo

[Chorus 2X]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Don't get me wrong, I've been hurt before
I close my eyes, I seen it coming through the door
But instead of seeing what was coming, I was feeling what he was running
Games, I don't know, it could be true
All of this is just my own point of view
I gave him real question, he gives me no, the answer
Sometimes I feel he's playing me like the panthers
He stopped by just to pass me over
Leaving me sober with a hangover
He doesn't wanna lay in this thing we have
I wanted his name to be my last...
Do you grasp?

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
