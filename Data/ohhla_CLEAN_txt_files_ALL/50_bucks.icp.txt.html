[Violent J] (Shaggy) 

(Hey yo J) 
What's up player? 
(You know they don't like juggalos over there) 
Right 
(50 bucks says you don't get nothin) 
Man, let me tell you somethin 
Check this out (What up?) 
It might sound shady 
But I fuck a rich hoe named Grady. 
They call her that cause her hair is blue, 
She's one of them rebellious rock chicks too. 
Anyway she has a big hoop in her neden, 
Rings, chains, needles, pins, and things 
Tatoos, it might sound fierce, 
But I swear to God the bitch gots her butthole pierced. 
She told me she liked it rough, I'm like straight, 
First thing she did was punch me in the face, 
I'm about to plant one to her jaw, 
Before I could she was tounging my balls, 
Oooooh whadablah, I dropped my weapon, 
Looked down and my nuts was kicksteppin, 
We was butt naked all over the floor 
It felt weird though cause we was at the Faygo store. 

(Chorus) 
Momma don't like this wicked clown 
I might come from the dark side of town 
When she's gone and you're alone again 
50 bucks says you'll let me in 

[Shaggy] (J) 

(Hey yo Shaggy) 
What up player? 
(You know they don't like juggalos over there) 
Right 
(50 bucks says you don't get nothing) 
Maan, let me tell you somethin. 
I've done fuck bitches both sides of the border, 
Nuthin like Gretta the millionaire's daughter, 
Something like 950-sumthin pounds, 
5'8" tall and she looove clowns. 
Bitch had titties like water balloons, 
My boys used to swing off 'em like baboons, 
She'd buy us chocolates, swiss cheese pie, 
And take it, and bake it... completely naked, 
An ocean of loopness it ain't like nuthin, 
Just jump anywhere in the mess and start humpin, 
Don't really matter where I stick my dick, 
I just reach (yeah), and grab (yeah), and stab (yeah), and jab (yeah), 
But that ain't the reason that I love this hoe, 
She used to do a funny little trick with my dick hole: 
She'd blow into it and make a wish, 
And my nuts would expand like puffer fish. 

Chorus 11x </pre>
