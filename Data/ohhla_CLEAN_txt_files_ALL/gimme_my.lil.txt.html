(Mmmhmm Niggas Playing Me Like I'm Pussy? Ok, I'm a Remember That
And I'm a Check The Game Off You Feel Me
Aye Bruhh, Yeah, I Know, Okay, You Feel Me
Yeah This Might Be Yo Beat But Why You Don't Fuck With Me Huh?
I'm a Tell You Why You Don't Fuck With Me
Because I Gotta Lotta Swag Nigga That's Why
&amp; I'm a Tell Somebody Else Something Man
I Gotta Lotta Bitches &amp; Everybody Know Me
You Know What I'm Saying, I'm a Tell You Man)

I'm yelling bitch mob motherfuck the task
All you sucka ass niggas puttin' the game on wax
If, you was a real nigga you woulda had my back
I'm yelling bitch mob nigga hate on that
You kissed the ho ass, I'm a break her back
They hounding out life what type of game is that
Twenty with a L, I ain't playin' that
I'm really to smart to be locked in chains
You niggas D.T.M (Down To Murder) This is not a game
I don't give a fuck, I am not a lame
Four door volvo can't stop a train
I'm on top of game, Bitch mob I'm hot
Tucked off low in the other spot
I was the underdog with the Ziplock
Damn based God let them bitches know
Based world Berkeley, down to the O
Down to the Richmond, I rep forreal
Bitch mob niggas I got girls forreal
I don't give a fuck, cause I look so good
Fucked the bitch ass cause I know you wouldn't
You do't play this, I don't give a fuck
Cause based world know I keep the guns up</pre>
