(Intro, News reporter)
Federal authorities say it works like this
The drugs are moved in bulk accross the Mexican border
to "hub cities" like Atlanta
Where it's broken down in warehouses
shipped to other cities, then broken down again where it's sold on the street
The cash goes back to the "hub cities"
where it's packaged and shipped back to cartel leaders in Mexico

(Hook, Juicy J)
Cocaine is a hell of a drug (Hell of a drug)
Mexico keep a hell of a plug (Hell of a plug)
Back up the truck; Put the drugs on the forklift (Forklift)
I'ma show you bitch niggas how we do this (Do this)
You got the fish-scale; I got the cash (I got the cash)
Let's swap it out; Let's do it fast (Do it fast)
You got the fish-scale; I got the cash (I got the cash)
Let's swap it out; Let's do it fast (Do it fast)

(Verse 1, Juicy J)
I was ridin wit' a connected guy; On my way to Georgia, bruh
To meet up wit' this nigga for some ki's out of Florida
I'm ridin wit' this fool; I ain't known this nigga but two months
He talkin on his cell; Speakin his Spanish, I'm like "Aw fuck..."
(Guy speaking spanish)
What that nigga sayin? (Uh huh)
(Guy speaking spanish)
Mayn, I ain't playin! (Aw, shit)
(Guy speaking spanish)
Here we go again...
(Guy speaking spanish)
I'ma do him in
I pulled a fourty-four from my draw's; Then I started blastin! (Gunshots)
I hit him in the neck, he started shakin; He was gaggin
I shot him in the head (Gunshots)
Then I took his body to a ditch
I respect the dead; But I disrespect a set-up snitch!

(Hook, Juicy J)
Cocaine is a hell of a drug (Hell of a drug)
Mexico keep a hell of a plug (Hell of a plug)
Back up the truck; Put the drugs on the forklift (Forklift)
I'ma show you bitch niggas how we do this (Do this)
You got the fish-scale; I got the cash (I got the cash)
Let's swap it out; Let's do it fast (Do it fast)
You got the fish-scale; I got the cash (I got the cash)
Let's swap it out; Let's do it fast (Do it fast)

(Verse 2, Juicy J)
I'm still ridin down to Georgia; Mane I hustle for the money!
This nigga tried to set me up; They have to give me somethin!
I done murd' my connect; Tell ya what's next
Somebody gon' get smoked like cigarettes
Cause I'm never slippin; Kept a old rusty tech
Underneath the seat for a cold blooded mess
Just before I knew, I saw a undercover Vette
Lights flashin crazy; I'm like holy shit
"GET YOUR ASS OUT THE CAR, AND GET YOUR ASS ON THE GROUND!!"
I knew somebody saw me dump the body; I can't go down
"I SAID GET YOUR ASS OUT THE CAR, AND GET YOUR ASS ON THE GROUND!!"
I'm surrounded by five more cars; It's the end now
**Gunshot**

(Outro, Male officer)
We believe the suspect has just shot himself in the head
Black male; Blood all over the windows, can't really see inside
Send an ambulance to 46'th and I-20
Male's in a white rental truck
Probably one of them drug runners again</pre>
