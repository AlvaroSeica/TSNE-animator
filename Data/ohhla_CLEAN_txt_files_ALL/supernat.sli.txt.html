Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Supernatural women
Give me the right
She was supernatural
Believe the power
She make it shower
Wash away the sorrow

We can make love to the rhythm she show
We can make love to the rhythm for sure

So supernatural
Believe the power
She make it shower
Wash away the sorrow

We can make love to the rhythm she show
You can't make war when you seek the tempo

She gives you no warning that she desires
You hear the voice coming to fight the fire
She could look what you seeking
Your dreams will find you

She give you no warning so you will follow
Take a breath from it together so
Its her gift that I will have to remain
In your arm always

To listen to the wind will make you pray
She might be speaking your name
Know(no) you might not hear it again

I could spend forever waiting
But the weather it won't answer to me
Will she ever hear me sing

Just recreate the breaks and then together we come naturally
She change a warriors ways
So supernatural
Believe the power
She make it shower
Wash away the sorrow

We can make love to the rhythm she show
We can make love to the rhythm for sure

So supernatural believe the power
Said let me feel the touch
She so beautiful
Feel your body oh
Supernatural

She can make you fall
So what you speak its spiritual
Deep into the rhythm though
Words don't come even close
Soul that calls you under
So we the physical
It be blood I'll let it flow
Cant beat the muscle
Protect me from the trouble

We bleed its chemical
We get down to the bone

I promise that she always will be
Keeping your entire soul

Shes the natural shes become invisible
But when the teaching will never leave

Every single day I'm not feeling right
Ooh whoa yay
So give me powers
Oh what got you free
All you build is
All I breathe
All I need

So come on pray for me
The missing pieces of the mystery in your name
Give to me the energy

Whispering releasing ancient secrets
Of the place you lock your treasure away
Is this another game that you play

I will break and enter in
No matter danger I will have to obey
She can put a spell on me

When I sleep forever
I will know what bliss is for it showers on me
Grass is growing even here again

So supernatural
Believe the power
She make it shower
Wash away the sorrow

We can make love to the rhythm she show
We can make love to the rhythm for sure

So supernatural
Believe the power
She make it shower
Wash away the sorrow

We can make love to the rhythm she show
You cant make war when you seek the tempo

She gives you no warning that she desires
You hear the voice coming to fight the fire
She could look what you seeking
Your dreams will find you

She give you no warning so you will follow</pre>
