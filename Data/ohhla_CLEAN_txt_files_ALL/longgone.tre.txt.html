[Trey Songz]
The Prince is back!
Mayday, "Trey Day"

So here we go with this again
Running at them lips again
Yellin in my ear and shit
All I hear is whisperin
No matter what it is
She always start to bitchin and
trippin and
I almost start to call that girl a bitch again
So I blaze out the house
In a rage out the house
Shawty got a sharp tongue
she spit blades out her mouth
I throw my stunnas on
I chop blades out the house
She get ta growlin and I'm out
It's like a cage in the house
Phone on silent and I'm wilin cuz I'm 'bout
Five shots of Henny in
Man, I'm makin plenty friends
Black, White, Dominican
Back right, I break it in
(This is the act right)
I need to take it in
Let's go!

I been drinkin
Tryin to take my mind up off all the yellin and all the screamin
But all that it's doin is takin me far from your lovin
Got this girl in my ear, tellin me what I don't need to hear
Sippin what I'm sippin and she bout to catch me slippin'

[Chorus]
I'm long gone missin, long gone missin
and I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl I gotta go home
I'm long gone missin, long gone missin
and I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl I gotta go home

[Trey Songz]
Now she's grindin
And the way she poppin that thang
Droppin that thang, reminds me
It ain't a girl in this world like mines
Wish she come find me (hope you hurry up)
It's gettin heated up (got me heated up)
If she keep it up, we gon' be leavin here (I'm sippin)
Sippin what I'm sippin and she bout to catch me slippin

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Now I look around, and all I see is cuties
Booties bouncin all around - I'm tryin to keep myself from goin down
With all the love I give you all you ever do is frown
Sippin what I'm sippin and she bout to catch me slippin

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
