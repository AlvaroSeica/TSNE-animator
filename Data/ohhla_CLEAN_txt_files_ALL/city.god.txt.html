New York City

Let's bring it back

[ VERSE 1: Necro ]
Bitch, this verse is your obituary, hit you very hard
Till you twitch like Klitschko, split ya, get you worried
Shoot that piece of chit, 8-inch-blade-gut you
Flinch when I cut you, headbutt you in a clinch
Sharp axe up your cardiovascular, spill your plasma
Smooth like a jazz player, blast Slayer
You're dearly departed in a casket
Full of bullets after I blast at your head
Leave you with a Raspberry Beret
Massacred, found in a barn in Nebraska
Cold like Alaska, legend like Sasquatch
The definition of masaculine and mass killing
Dusted like Joplin, dropping mescaline
Strychnine, rat killer, pest control
Kill you like cholesterol
Rapping death, I'm the best of all time
Let's celebrate a festival of crime
Digestible, fresh, if you test, I'II pull the nine
New York City

[ CHORUS ]
Pop nines, slummin in the city
Packin my gat, gettin dirty and gritty
Cop dimes, sellin in the city
Cut the back of your neck, GEMStar, not pretty
(Slice)

[ VERSE 2: Kool G Rap ]
On the verge of a murder wave, burner spray
Mercury tips shit, vibrate every disc in your vertebrae
Viet veteran, vest, desert of metal and
Sword for severin heads off, get Red Cross
Hostile mentality, no hospitality
Considerin what the hospital bed cost
Get John Lennon'd, cronz bomb your linen
Lend 'em a few from out the Remington
Word is bond, you're feminine
Blow slugs, get no love, this ain't Wimbledon
Deadly stares for teddy bears, my thugs Gremlins
Real dealy like hillbillies, you still silly
Leave you still as Achilles, under lilies with steel, feel me?
Smooth jiggaboo, trigger crew, blickers move
Better respect the sket or hit the deck like skipper shoes
Ridicule, I'ma riddle dudes, the kid loose
Use the ratchet in the blackjacket to twist a screw

[ CHORUS ]

Queens, nigga
Brooklyn, kid
Bronx
Shaolin
Manhattan, rep that
Queens, nigga
Brooklyn, kid,
New York City
