[Verse 1]
I'm a emcee who spits with intimacy
I want you to see into me infinitely
I want you to be friends with me innocently
In a sense it depends if we can proceed
And we could bless Eden without eatin from trees
We don't need leaves
We could be free
Kick out the serpent his tricks aren't workin
I'm blessed with two S's
My desert's dessert
It's like

[Hook]
Who's gonna tell me how I'm supposed to act?
I'm supposed to be scared? I ain't notice that
Somebody told me rap's getting overpacked
Holy crap!
I ain't holdin back
I'm bout to

Pull my hat low and put my hoodie on
Pull my hat low and put my hoodie put my hoodie
Pull my hat low and put my hoodie on
Pull my hat low and put my hoodie put my hoodie

[Verse 2]
I'm a emcee who seems bourgeoisie
If you can spell that word then you're cooler than me
You could speak foolery
Neutered you'll be
It ain't new to me
Lunacy's been the usual since puberty
Truthfully I grew up brutally
Then beautifully
It turned to jubilee
Kick out the serpent his tricks aren't workin
I'm blessed with two esses my desert's dessert it's like

[Hook]
Who's gonna tell me how I'm supposed to act?
I'm supposed to be scared? I ain't notice that
Somebody told me rap's getting overpacked
Holy crap!
I ain't holdin back
I'm bout to

Pull my hat low and put my hoodie on
Pull my hat low and put my hoodie put my hoodie
Pull my hat low and put my hoodie on
Pull my hat low and put my hoodie put my hoodie

[Bridge]
If you're lookin for the real (you could find that)
Want something you can feel (you could find that)
Paint your bedroom teal (you could find that)
Standin' tall while you kneel (you could find that)
If you're lookin for the real (you could find that)
Want something you can feel (you could find that)
Paint your bedroom teal (you could find that)
Standin' tall while you kneel (you could find that)

[Hook] x2
Who's gonna tell me how I'm supposed to act?
I'm supposed to be scared? I ain't notice that
Somebody told me rap's getting overpacked
Holy crap! I ain't holdin back
I'm bout to

Pull my hat low and put my hoodie on
Pull my hat low and put my hoodie put my hoodie
Pull my hat low and put my hoodie on
Pull my hat low and put my hoodie put my hoodie</pre>
