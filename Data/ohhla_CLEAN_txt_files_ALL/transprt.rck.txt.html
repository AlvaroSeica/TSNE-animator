Song:   Transporter
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

One time for the niggaz that's huggin' the block
Two times for the boys that's bubblin' rock
Three times for the G's including myself
Four times for the brothers that's reachin' the wealth
Five times for the hustle I taught it myself
Transporter I bought it myself
I bought it myself

Niggaz major, taylor two's? the newest gators
Gangsta, I'm muthafuckin' Albert Anastasia
Michael Corleone, presidential Rolly on
Net worth unknown, closet full of Skull and Bones
Silver spurs come his and hers, just live and learn
Snipers on the roof's for troops, that's for whom it concern's
Applaud the whore's abroad awaiting my return
Ressurected like Makaveli, pray my soul burns
Sole supplier for cocaine in southern states
Sending sack city to city, be back in a couple days
Don't get me started, I make triple in fickle markets
My profit margin'll have all you local niggaz starvin'

One time for the niggaz that's huggin' the block
Two times for the boys that's bubblin' rock
Three times for my borhters who reachin' the wealth
Four times for the G's including myself
Thinking back when a nigga never had a quarter
Much love for the bitches wearing something shorter
Five times for the trap, got a nigga ballin'
But I gotta take my hat off to the Transporter

When I'm looking for a certain feeling, gotta hit it raw
Look up to my ceiling ladies, chandeliers galore
Look into my closet then you know I love couture
Even more shoe collection too fly for the fucking floor
Shelves, Louis V in shelves
Shoot the fucking stylist we gon' find this shit ourselves
Audemar was designed by Swizz Beatz
Black face black ben on stitching is a beast
They say the least I am extradinaire
Transporter yeah I bought it, yeah pistols in the air

Sole supplier for cocaine in southern states
Sending sack city to city, back in a couple days
Don't get me started, I make triple in fickle markets
My profit margin'll have all these local niggaz starvin'

I got the thangs, I'mma tell ya once
Better have your money right, you won't see me for months

One time for the niggaz that's huggin' the block
Two times for the boys thats bubblin' rock
Three times for my borhters who reachin' the wealth
Four times for the G's including myself
Thinking back when a nigga never had a quarter
Much love for the bitches wearing something shorter
Five times for the trap, got a nigga ballin'
But I gotta take my hat off to the Transporter</pre>
