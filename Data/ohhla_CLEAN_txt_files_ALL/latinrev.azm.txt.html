(Verse 1)
Metronome in it like a methadone clinic 
Fake death certificate, hit the mortician
Get love, old
Graveyard fluid
Half halo, half horn
I'm a mutant of music
X-man/X-Men, my left hand cool bits
Get pissed
Beat down your chicken with a pool stick 
Loose lips sink friendships
Cruise drift
Walk a tightrope, it's life, only fools trip 
X marks the spot, hit you and your crucifix 
Fix ya asthma boy, we got moves to flip
Make tricks/Matrix, with the number scams 
At the Death Star party with a counterfeit pass
Camouflage suit
Troops in the sand
Build castles before you assholes could stand 
You're nervous, I come through with Sons of Sam 
Start runnin'
Niggas was clappin' their hands 
Estrogen pie
Cherry cream is fillin' it
Either you kill that noise or we killin' it 
The pills that you pop for fun and can't spell'll
End up being the same pills you on for real
Jewel it, telling yourself "Super soothe it"
Make it so you can park right where the blue is
I play rappers out like Shell Toes and Wu Wear
Any where they got me most, I'm a move there
Azeem stare into space like a soothsayer
I seen the future, it's primitive there

Keep it comin', baby, yeah

(Verse 2)
I make 'em jump off roof-tops
Land on two-cops
Search the tube-socks
Ban the boom-box
Grand's a shoe box
Hands on two glocks that ain't loaded
How come ya man's think he 2Pac
Cyclops to Sasquatch on night watch
Cause I Shot The Sheriff and you killed his wife, what
Locked in Texas and live for the hot seat
You say "Azeem" and I'm a feed you to Nazis
Ain't nobody, just candles and pictures 
Wonder what your last words was, "Hail Hitler"
Aight, I'm playin', but I will get with ya
Like a video game, but for real, there's no fiction
Mail you a dead pigeon, shit in your kitchen
Come home and find your fuckin' front door missin'
Got some dodgin' and dippin', swimmin'
And shadows appear when ya fear's least expectin' 
There's you, takin' a piss butt naked 
There's you, machete to chainsaw session
There's you
Think you alive, but you trippin'
Tryin' to grab a brew, wonder why you can't sip it, and
