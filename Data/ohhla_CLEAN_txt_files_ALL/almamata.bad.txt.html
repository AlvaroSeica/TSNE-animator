(This the Alma Mata) Everybody raise up, raise up 
(Watch out for dat' South Carolina shit) 
Yeah put your hands in the air,(put your hands in the air) 
(Like dis')Like dis' here, check it out 

I'm country as fuck, I'm proud of it 
I'm livin' down south, shit nigga' I love it 
I'm country as fuck, I'm proud of it 
I'm livin' down south, shit nigga' I love it 
I'm country as fuck, I'm proud of it 
I'm livin' down south shit nigga' I love it 
I'm country as fuck, I'm proud of it 
I'm livin' down south shit nigga' I love it 

300 plus shawty and I love to fuck(love to fuck) 
Love to smoke weed, love to get my dick suck 
It's an everyday ritual, cash before em' all 
Others niggas see it different but that's my call 
See I ain't greedy for green, but I'mma get what I earn 
And if you thinkin' any other that that then you got something to learn 
I ain't cho' cotton-pickin' fool, I ain't cho' ignorant ass nigga 
Smoke dope all day but rarely fuck wit' cho' liquor 
See I'm far from the nigga, that sit on my ass and just complain 
Mastermind offense and defense Phatz ain't neva' out tha game 
Reserve the sidelines for the rookies 
Ol' sissy ass wussies, ol' sissy ass pussies 
Ol' triflin' ass pussies 

I keep my thoughts to myself, unless' its written on paper 
That should go and letta' nigga' know how much I hate cha' 
I been livin' down south my nigga' all of my life 
No matter how much I swing I'm always loosin' a fight 
Some folks pack up and leave, but I be damn if I be(go) go 
I'm tryin' to get rich quick be damn if I'mma go broke 
These stereotype-ass people say fucked up shit bout' my state 
When they ain't never lived in it 
ain't never brought they fuck-ass my way 
See in your eyes all you see is cow pastures, 
and collard greens eatin' ass niggas' 
Probably thank niggas' still washin' clothes 
and fetchin' water out of dirty-ass creeks and rivers 
Ain't no such thang man you can't judge a book by its cover 
Until you seen it for yourself then you can't judge brother 

I'm country as fuck, I'm proud of it 
I'm livin' down south, shit nigga' I love it 
I'm country as fuck, I'm proud of it 
I'm livin' down south, shit nigga' I love it 
I'm country as fuck, I'm proud of it 
I'm livin' down south, shit nigga' I love it 
I'm country as fuck, I'm proud of it 
I'm livin' down south, shit nigga' I love it 

See I'm country as fuck 
I'm down on my luck 
When the pressures on nigga', shit who can you trust 
So I pour my own poison to relieve my stress 
I can't make it on my own, Lord I need to be bless 
It's 90 degrees in the shade, but I still feel cold 
I gots this feeling, I'mma feel this way til' I'm dead and I'm gon' 
But I ain't gon' let shit take me, I'mma stand up and fight 
This time I got my skills together and my swing trunk-tight 
So if you speakin' bout' my itty, bitty city negatively 
I be guaranteed to make my shit connect so you can feel me 
The south's my fuckin' home, and if you come here talkin' shit 
I be damned if I leave this hoe alone, feel me bitch 
I'mma buck on your ass til' your bitch ass fall 
And if you come wit' mo' niggas', I'm takin' out all of y'all 
Man I'm country as a mug, and proud as fuck 
See once I was down, but now I'm up on my luck 

They came cross plenty muthafuckas, bit off a lil' change 
Don't know who in the fuck they dealin' with 
Insultin'  my game 
I'm one of the hardest hittin' niggas' thats out on the field 
Never hear me hollerin' bout' keepin' it real 
What the fuck is keepin' it real?!! 
"Be yourself" Daddy said, 
Pist on what dem' other niggas' doin' 
It's they on fuck up if they lives they ruin 
Always been bad as fuck ain't no skinny-yimmy 
All that animosity you pump, fuck it don't even offend me 
Ambush, thats how we came 
Suckas thought they was the big mountains, became the small grains 
Damn right we CAROLINIANS 
Got any questions? 
Couldn't be a better time, I'm right here ready for discussion 
Yeah I'm country as fuck, I'm proud of it 
And I'm livin' down south, shit nigga' I love it 
You feel the breeze smell shell smoke 

the trees got the guts that hit the box 
Handle it, push the hard rock, the hard rock 

I'm country as fuck, I'm proud of it 
I'm livin' down south shit nigga' I love it
