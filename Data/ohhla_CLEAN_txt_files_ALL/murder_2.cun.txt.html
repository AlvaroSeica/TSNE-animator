[Intro/Chorus]
If I could get away with murder, er 
I'd take my gun and I'd commit it
If I could get away with murder, er 
I'd take my gun and I'd commit it

[Big K.R.I.T. over Chorus]
Yo, yo, Big K.R.I.T. y'all Krizzle..
Shit, if I can get away with murder shawty
I'll go to war out 'chea, ya feel me
Me and my potnas get this bread

[Big K.R.I.T.]
What if I told you that the battle is on? Would that, rattle ya bones? 
Or would you be down to kill in the name of the throne?
Drop bombs on innocent people or innocent homes 
With automatic weapons or, military drones 
While me and my friends play croquet and make bets 
on which country liable to fold next (Ya fold next!)
Under the pressure of my fingertips, any day or any time 
They just cattle, we don't need they kind any how! 
Talkin population control 
Gotta make room for the young, so it's out with the old 
I got tanks that need usin, I'm lettin 'em go 
for the low and some C-4 charges that's ready to blow 
I got the ticket on sativa 'cause my potna the supplier 
and all my homies down to invest in my empire 
Sink the economy with no natural evidence 
They complain, but that's a part of being president 
(Krizzle)

[Chorus]
If I could get away with murder, er 
I'd take my gun and I'd commit it
If I could get away with murder, er 
I'd take my gun and I'd commit it

[Natti]
Yeah, ye-yeah..
I could use worship as a warship, bible and sword 
Turn men and women to minions over heaven's rewards 
Promise Islamic bombers heavens harem of whores 
for taking out a couple of floors 
The holiest wars bring profits/prophets and I don't mean Moses 
Unless he's on the screen when the NASDAQ opens 
Horatio Caine won't be able to blame me 
for the third party bodies that his followers slain 
Ashes and burnt remains all left in the name 
of, whoever you praise, I just made it a game 
called, Winners and Sinners, but they one and the same 
You can play along with us at home 
We livin in Rome, destined to fall,didn't you hear? 
I ain't worried 'bout the views of the public and peers 
shit, Hitler was once Time mags' Man of the Year 
I'ma. get it with hope while I'm peddlin fear 
I'm a wolf in a wool cap with robes to match 
Leadin the flock right down the hatch 
I'm the fox in the hen house, the +Devil You Know+ 
in a black Cadillac, wrist glistenin gold 
on my way to eat steaks with T.D. Jakes 
So if you wanna dine with Christ you gon' need these tapes 
And if you still don't how cold I am
Please turn to page three in ya church program
