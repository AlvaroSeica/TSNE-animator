Black Market Designer Love, Kung Lao
Ha, Anubis5
Feel the vibe, feel the vibe, feel the vibe. Yo, feel alive.
Feel the vibe, feel alive

My beautiful black widow razor legged arachnid, how do you stay so seductive
If affection was a drug I'd be starchasing on acid, I still play it like I'm reluctant
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Thoughts of you are abrasive speeding up my heart's pace
I close my eyes and rest assure my soul
That I'm going to stay focused till I start to lose control

Cause there ain't no tax on attraction
No, there ain't no tax on attraction
No there ain't no tax, there ain't no tax
There ain't no tax on attraction
There ain't no tax on attraction
There ain't no tax on attraction
No there ain't no tax, there ain't tax
There ain't no tax on attraction</pre>
