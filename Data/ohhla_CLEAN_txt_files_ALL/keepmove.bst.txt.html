Typed by: blohm@u.arizona.edu

Dear Alex and Marilyn
They're Lovey and Thurston howellin'
The grasshopper unit is prowellin'
And Rufus is back home growellin'
For all of y'all that are dozin'
On Hornblower's lederhosen
Like Walt Disney he'll be frozen
And then the Swiss Hall of Fame he goes in
Cause when he's out in space carousin'
Pick up my mic and start joustin'
His name plate medallion
Says never trust a Hal 9000

Can't, won't, don't stop 
Can't, won't, don't stop 

Check the horizontal hold and check the tint
Are these three fools back at it again?
Inspector Clouseau and Derek Flint
Nothin but sparks ignitin'
Check two one two mic testin'
This one goes out to Dechen
Rise fallen fighters take your stance again
Don't think too much about the color of skin
Order in vegetarian' shark's fin
Try to keep my life non-violent
Mario, rewind the tape and "punch me in!"
Like Chuck D with the where you never been I'm in

Can't, won't, don't stop
Can't, won't, don't stop

"I'm a long way from where I've been but I gotta keep movin'"
"Movin' 'long"

Ooh my my I'm really not feeling it
Ooh my my something's really wrong
Ooh my my I'm really not feeling it
Ooh my my something's really wrong

The PA sound is deafenin'
Bitin' MCs I'm oustinin'
With spinach in your teeth you're grinnin'
So on your way out please take a mint
Got the studio to throw a craze in
The basslines Yauch just lays in
This song is the grass you're grazin'
Add a little flange and phase in
Don't get mad 'cause I'm beguilin'
I'm off the hook so don't bother dialin'
They're gonna put me in the B-I-N 
And if I die notify the next of kin

It's like that y'all (x8)
Can't, won't, don't stop
