[Hook]
Talking that shit, about a Boss Hogg nigga
We gon, (see about chaaaaa)
And if you plex with me, while this tech with me
I'ma, (see about chaaaaa)

[Kyleon]
Don't get your ass whipped, don't get your ass shot
And if a nigga slipping, he get his ass got
The Houston Medical Center, is your last stop
When I swell up your head, like a mascot
We'll beat a nigga ass, till he pass out
Kick him to the curb, like we putting trash out
Wet these cowards up, like the water on
And give him shots to the head, like quarter stone
Hey is your daughter home, cause I'm trying to fuck
But she ain't getting in my truck, if she ain't trying to suck
Round here niggaz get killed, behind a buck
So when you hear them gun shots, you better duck
Now let's get it crunk, like your car on
And turn the whole fucking club, to a war zone
And buy up all the liquor, till the bar gone
Play some gangsta shit, by Killa Kyleon

[Hook - 2x]

[Kyleon]
We the Boyz N Blue, bitch it's our time
Money long, and it stretch like a power line
You might glow, but it ain't bright as our shine
You might hustle, but it ain't strong as our grind
I know you see us pulling up, in them big body loads
We fuck with fine dimes, you fuck with them big body hoes
You can catch me and Slim, hopping out big body Rolls
Or that Lac E.S.V., on them 24's
Everything new, everything blue
We speak facts on tracks, everything true
Plus we hungry, it's time to eat dinner folk
We them new niggaz, taking over Interscope
It's the Boss, and his hitman Killa
You might be nice, but this man iller
And I ain't gotta keep, telling y'all we ball
Just look at the line of blue cars, on the C-Wall
