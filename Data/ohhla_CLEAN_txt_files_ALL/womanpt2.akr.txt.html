[Intro - Cuts by DJ Revolution]
"Listen to me hunny, ah hunny listen here please"
"You got, you gotta put me on"
"Listen to me hunny, ah hunny listen here please"
"You got, you gotta put me on"
Listen to me, to me, listen to me, to me"
"Listen to me hunny, ah hunny listen here please"
"You gotta put me on" (you gotta put me on)

[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
Yo, I was in park zonin out, yeah I know I'm a dreamer
Plus the woman of my dreams just drove off in a Beemer
As I'm listenin to "Paid In Full" fade into the distance
This girl came out of nowhere with a body that glistened
So I looked her up and down, instantly makin my day
And hunny had more curves that than interstate highway
Could of wrote a chapter about every step that she took
But a player like me, already wrote that book
And the rejection I was feelin, I was suddenly over it
I'm steppin to this new chick on some Black Casanova shit
Wait, let me catch myself before it's too late
Instead of tryin to get some ass, let me shoot for a date
I had to tell her I don't drive, but even then she was straight
Said "take the train to Mass. Ave and I'll meet you at eight" (aight)
Now I'm amped up because I'm takin her out
But you know what's on my mind and what I'm thinkin about ('bout)

[Break - Cuts by DJ Revolution]
"Sex"
"Is what I'm after, uh huh"
"Y-y-you gotta put me on"
"Sex"
"Is what I'm after, uh huh"
"You got, you gotta put me on"
"Sex"
"Is what I'm, what I'm after, uh huh"
"You got, you gotta put me on"
"Sex"
"Is what I'm, what I'm after, uh huh"
"You gotta put me on" (gotta put me on, put me on)

[Verse 2 - Akrobatik]
Yo, she was like Rosario Dawson and Claudette Ortiz
With a little Halle Berry and Angelina Jolie
When she spoke it was like Lauryn Hill or Maya Angelou
All of those brains and body too hot to handle to (woo!)
Any hoo, I made my way on the train
Thinkin a couple drinks later, I'd be gettin some brains
But halfway through dinner, I'm like "what was I thinkin?"
She's like "you ain't drivin, so I ain't drinkin!"
See I was much younger then and nowhere near as well traveled
So what little game I had now, quickly unraveled
But we did make it back to her place, albeit sober
So I'm thinkin that there's a chance that I might still get over
Nope, all we did was watch "Coming to America"
Eddie's gettin a bath and I'm left here to stare at her
But I'm a man dammit, screamin heterosexual
There's plenty of time for her to find me intellectual
Went in for some sugar and she gave me a kiss
But when it didn't go no further, I'm like "what the hell is this?"
Now she's all annoyed and your boy is frustrated
She told me that I would have been straight, if I just waited
Now I'm sittin home, all alone and I just hate it
I bet she would have loved me to death, if we just made it (word)
But you know I ain't dealin with no deficit
I'm callin up around the way friend with benefits

"Sex"
"What I'm, is what I'm after, uh huh"
"You gotta put me on"
"Sex"
"Is what I'm after, uh huh"
"Y-y-you gotta put me on" (gotta put me on, gotta put me on)

[Verse 3 - Akrobatik]
I think it's funny, how us brothers always livin in doubt
Like how if we don't get no tail right away, then we out
But we'll kick it with the chick that give it up the first week
And never trust us her because we always suspect she a freak
Now you could break a woman down with seductive tactics
But it always come back on some foot up the ass shit
When you kick it to a lady, brother know what she wants
Cause if it's sex she wants, then it's sex she'll flaunt
But it's somethin to be said about a girl that's refined
When that bangin body is equally matched by her mind
So now when a hunny wants to wait, you know I'm a let her
But don't get it twisted baby girl, the sooner, the better

[Outro - Cuts by DJ Revolution]
"Sex"
"Is what I'm after"
"You gotta, you gotta put me on"
(*scratching*)
"Uh huh"
"Sex"
"Is what I'm after"
"You gotta put me on"
"Uh huh"
"Listen to me, ah hunny listen her please"
(*Next line is scratched several times until end*)
"You gotta put me on" (gotta put me on)</pre>
