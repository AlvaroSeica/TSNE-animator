do exactly as instructed, my super powers hypnotic
stronger than any narcotic ,got you caught on my web,
and growing inside, they call me simon the diamond eye spins in spirals
forming crowds, no ins and outs, for miles indigenous follow
reaching regions, alerting the heathens
they heard it through speakers, it's the truth
the spirits are controlling the preacher
the sound of its psychedelic, promoters bring out the medics
sorry I had to sell it, gather and watch me tell it now
malachi, king of the street, protected by medical
better now, bigger and faster
move when I let it out
take the lion to his castle, he been gaffled
release the beast from his shackles, the hungry jackals
in the courtyard the peasants pick his bones clean
screams from the home team, long live the king, omni
long live the family that stands beside me
the mastermind of this shit is kept in hiding
theyl never find me, though some say they saw sighting
but alias after alias I cant be id'd
they'll never catch me I'm above the law, the beast in my own belly
I do the work of god, what police and them gone tell me

war on the streets like hyenas and lions
stampeded from the lights and the sirens, obey the code of silence

this is for my people up on the grind, the daily hustle
omni and wild translating time
you'll find whoa
all my cats all up in the cut
who brings the ruck, when we up in this piece
c'mon turn it up
non stopping it, c'mon
club rockin it, c'mon
yes, this is for the streets, keep hip hoppin' it
c'mon
ones for the ladies, two's the freaks
for my dogs let me hear ya on the beat
yak speaks with ox, verbalistic verbal
ever word will get you in tune
similar to second hand smoke of the herbal
the streets have been in need for this raw breed
heated to a point, like alien acid
yes my squad bleeds
while others cock block with read
we rock the mic indeed
hustlin' on the grind, the child who got 5 mouths to feed
focus on the boom to the bap, old school bebop
we we drop its left coast collapses
similiar to graphiti rock
when your lounging in the club your feeling g
or in your car hearing soliloquies that be flowing publicly
defiant, 6 foot 2, similar to a giant
after every show, get more press, released than the case of kobe bryant
I got flows, plans
this niggas got fives, up in the sky
but we rockin the beat drops, who got the hives
others get the cooties, glancing at female booties
once I make eye contact, yes, I'm holding down my duties
up on the mic, similar to pied piper with a pipe
got cats up in this game for the business, I'm in this for the fight
who can reveal to the world who is fraudulent
it's the gods that went
it's the wildchild that keep your heads bobbin' it.
feelin' it

this is for my people up on the grind, the daily hustle
omni and wild translating time
you'll find whoa
on my cats all up in the cut
who brings the rough, when we up in this piece
c'mon turn it up
non stopping it, c'mon
club rockin it, c'mon
yes, this is for the streets, keep hip hoppin' it
c'mon
ones for the ladies, two's the freaks
for my dogs let me hear ya on the beat

heres your chance, step it up
and understand the reasons, it deepens this even bermuda, triangles
old souls, melon head sculls detect sci borgs
anything I live for I die for
welcome you to my world
at light speed, the night breed life without morning
stay positive, greyscales balance parallels
polar opposites
no fear, no eyes, no ears
disappear, reappear here
stand clear I'm still active, generating massive
it's an omni present, wildchild classic

this is for my people up on the grind, the daily hustle
omni and wild translating time
you'll find whoa
on my cats all up in the cut
who brings the rough, when we up in this piece
c'mon turn it up
non stopping it, c'mon
club rockin it, c'mon
yes, this is for the streets, keep hip hoppin' it
c'mon
ones for the ladies, two's the freaks
for my dogs let me hear ya on the beat</pre>
