[INTRO: AT YOUR DISCRETION DRUMZ]

[Verse One: Need Not Worry]
What up Pap? "What up chap? How was your day today??" (wack)
"Whas it really?"..matter fact it wasnt even like that
It was kinda cool, math exam went smooth not shaky
I know my grade is way above an 80
and third period I got a number from a lady
I been chasing on the daily but she always say maybe
today finally, I got it I'ma call her and connect
"you better talk to her with some respect son..
anyway I see you got a ride", yeah I met this cat paul
a tall, jive talker from the wall
he was coming thru the neighborhood to get up with his mom
and he seen me round the area and said he'd drop me off "(thats fresh)"
nothing less pop, what you do this afternoon?
"I sat around and listened to some tunes....
jazz, funk, and the rhythm of the blues
and then I hit the mall to get a shirt and shoes"

[Hook: 4 bars]

[Verse Two: Need Not Worry]
"What up Chap?" What up Pap, how was your day today? "(slow)"
Why so? "your mother had to drag me to the sto'
for no apparent reason, I aint really have to go
and then she made me fix the kitchen sick because it broke"
(that sucks pop).."The family man don't stop
got a job at home after the 9 to 5 spot
chap, don't you have a basketball game today?
game to play...aint you like 28 points away.."
From a record of points scored in season
and if not tonite, maybe another evening..
pop you gonna come and check it? "you bet kid"
even tall paul is gonna be upon the set kid
he's gonna be the tall cat that I'ma jet with
"well, good luck, put up a 30 point convention"
yep pop, I'ma teach 'em all a lesson
put up 32 and shake their hand to show profession

[Hook: 4 bars]

[Verse Three: Need Not Worry]
Yo Pap "(what?)" lemme get a couple ginger snaps 
don't be eating em all, you know mom dont like that
..."matter of fact, lets go out and celebrate
cus you put up 38 points....record setting day"
let's do it..I could eat a horse no fluid
(in unison) with a little slice of pie...hahahaha uncle Lewis
says it all the time, he be killing me with that
"I know chap, we used to say that back in 59"
(yep) now its 84 and its still going strong
cus you and yours like to let the lingo live long
..."you gotta do it....one day you'll see
that old days are gone but you keep the old ways"
should we head back home its getting late
"naw its okay, its good to have a good day"
...you're right, let's hit the park and walk
until dark...let's continue with the small talk
