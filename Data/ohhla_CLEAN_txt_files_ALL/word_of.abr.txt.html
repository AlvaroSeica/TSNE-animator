[Verse 1]
Bounce to the word of mouth
Announce what you heard about
Down for the
Count with the
One, two
Turn em out
Run through
Burn em down
Unscrew
Turn around
Undo
One truth
Son, you the unpigeon holeable
Washin dishes in the kitchen still spittin quotables
Lotsa vicious wishes which is real when you're notable
Flowin off the handle, hold a candle to my rhyme
Install the solar panel so my clan'll get the shine
Blind to the facts you're not touching the machine
With that eye-chart crisp flow, trust that I can see
I be the Peter Parker who doesn't need to conquer
Eat a piece of bark and a marker and never see a doctor
Well I be the scene rocker
Switch up flows like Fina Aqua
Prem Rock, every drop inside my liter's proper
We could feed a pumpkin eater something sweeter
Country bumpkin puffin cheeba doesn't need a vodka
What

[Verse 2]
Jump down
Turn around
Lemme see you
Rock that
Jump down
Turn around
Lemme see you
Move
Move, jump down
Turn around
Pull it out your top hot
Jump down
Turn around
Pull it out your shoe
Shoo fly with the wings of a Nike
I might be spiky like cleats
Clean like a white tee
Bring it to your psyche
The minstrel of pen strokes
Ten-four good buddy, show it to your kin folk
En Vogue told me to free my mind
But you're never gonna get it
What's the reason why?
Well the reason why I Xscape by design
While raising up the rates, change the shape of the sign
I'm an octagon
Here to stop
The calm
I'm the Parthenon
You're a soccer mom
I'm a hopper like Dennis playin tennis
I'll show a 40 love
I am heavy like Guinness
C'mon

[Verse 3]
Get down
Show em how
Onus to the dopest owl
Right now
Say it loud
Ain't a time to joke around
Appropriate opiates spoke colloquial and broken down
Copious odious moments cozy with loneliness now
Bumpin Thelonious Monk, funk got em open with style
Who bit the holiest cow?
Unceremonious I'll be acrimonious stay away from the phoniest
Wow
Open court
Gavel pound
Holdin trial
Gather round
Battle grounds
Hey hey
Hope we don't blow it now
Throw a pound slow it down one thing that I noticed how
Can I try to grow the seeds of my life with a stolen plow?
MetroCard bitch, that's how I'm rollin now
Yes yes rollin on the up and up the golden child
Settle down buttercup I don't think you can hold it now
Got too many rhymes you can't empty me
In my DNA is an MP3
Put the key in, say, "Open sesame"
Open say you
Closing says me</pre>
