[Chorus - Big Sean] w/ (ad-libs)
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like
Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid... 

[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
Wobble-dy wobble-dy, wa-wobble, wobble
I'm st-stacking my paper my wallet look like a bible
I got girlies half naked, that shit look like the grotto
How your waist anorexic and then your ass is colossal
Like WHOOP! Drop that ass, make it boomerang
Take my belt off, bitch I'm Pootie Tang
Tippy taow, tippy tay, you gon' get a tip today
Fuck that, you gon' get some dick today
I walk in with my crew and I'm breaking they necks
I'm looking all good, I'm making her wet
They pay me respect they pay me in checks
And if she look good she pay me in sex (Do it)
Bounce that ass (ass), it's the roundest (roundest)
You the best (best), you deserve a crown bitch
Right on that...

[Chorus] w/ (ad-libs)

[Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj]
Wobbly wobbly, wo-wo-wobble, wobbin'
Ass so fat, all these bitches' pussies is throbbin'
Bad bitches, I'm your leader, Phantom by the meter
Somebody point me to the best ass-eater
Tell 'em "Pussy clean!" I tell them "Pussy squeaky!"
Niggas give me brain 'cause all of them niggas geeky
If he got a mandingo, then I buy him a dashiki
And bust this pussy open in the islands of Waikikiiiiii...
Kiss my ass and my anus, 'cause it's +Finally Famous+
And it's finally soft, yeah, it's finally solved
I don't know, man, guess them ass shots wore off
Bitches ain't poppin', google, my ass
Only time you on the net is when you Google my ass
Y-y-you fuckin' little whores, fu-f-ckin' up my decors
Couldn't get Michael Kors if you was fuckin' Michael Kors
B-B-Big Sean, b-boy, how big is yo
Gimme all yo' money and gimme all yo' residuals
Then slap it on my...

[Chorus] w/ (ad-libs)

[Bridge - Big Sean] w/ (ad-libs)
White girls, Black girls
Tall girls, fat girls
Shake that ass, (shake that ass), shake that ass, (shake that ass)
Shake that ass, (shake that), shake that ass
Short girls, small girls 
Skinny girls, all girls
Shake that ass, (shake that ass), shake that ass, (shake that ass)
Shake that ass, (shake that), shake that ass
And I want all of that...

[Chorus] w/ (ad-libs)

Go STUPID! {*echoes until fade*}</pre>
