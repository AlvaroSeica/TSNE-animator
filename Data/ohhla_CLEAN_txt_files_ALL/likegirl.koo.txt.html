Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1:]
Tell me what should I do, what should I say
I'm lost for words so I'm coming to you, sistas
Will you help me, see I don't know, where to start
to find the keys to win over a woman's heart
Well first, things to remember when your game comes into play
Gain your composure show respect and you'll be okay
because the ladies really like it when
When you don't succeed, don't get offended
Listen when she speaks and don't pretend

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh. I like that girl. [2x]

[Verse 2]
Yeah she says that she like you, too, but she's too shy come and talk to you so
Boy, you have to make that move if you want her to be yours
Show me a man that will be me, love
Love me for me
I'm not asking much
See true love don't come easily and if it's meant to be, it happens natuarlly
If you don't look for love, it might actually find you
Now tell me what you want, what you need
Cause I be thinking ya'll be bout diamonds, pretty necklaces nice cars, bling bling
I thought ya'll made it clear, love dont' cost a thing
Tell me if I'm wrong or right
I don't want to make the same mistake I made before
she walked out the door cause her love I ignored
I just want to take my time and explore her world cause
truth be told, I really like this girl

[Chorus]

Now it don't matter the size of your bankroll
Cause I'm an independent women, I can take care of my own
I don't care bout your escalade or your sprees sitting on chrome
Cause when it comes to a woman, you need a girl that you can take home

[Last chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh I like that girl. [2x]

You know, mommy, you're the best thing I ever seen come round my way
and I want you to be down with me like I'm with you, yes, you, girl
You know you drive me crazy
Ooh ooh yeah
You got me saying, ooh ooh yeah
You got me going, ooh ooh yeah
You got me singing, ooh ooh yeah
I'm feeling everything ya'll been talking bout
And for her it's time for me to kick the player out
With no doubt it's been running through my mind
Settling down, true love I have found, my world she's forever my sunshine
My pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, see
love is not about the material. but it's mental heartfelt
And spiritual

I like that girl yeah [4x]</pre>
