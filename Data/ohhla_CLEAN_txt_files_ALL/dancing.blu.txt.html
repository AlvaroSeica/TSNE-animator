[Verse 1]
Look... it's six oclock I'm hopping outta the bed
Rain fallin callin X but my phone lines dead
I guess my bills aint paid
no ride to work for the day
second option:
hop the bus but theres a traffic delay
my boss is trippin cause I'm running late and aint no excuse
when I'm bout to be 22 without a whip I could swoop
feel like I'm finna shoot my own dome with chrome to escape
zonin out cause workin workin out aint worth what I make
my lady callin always fussin just because we aint ballin
but it's hard cause her cousins fuckin rich, cause her husband's huslin
and I aint fuckin touchin nothin but a mic
5 oclock and off work ready to go home and write
but I aint got a buck to catch the bus chillin at the stop
rain fallin hard as ever and it's soakin my socks 
fuck it
kick my kicks of and took of my jacket
roll my jeans up beat up and my headphones blastin
blazed some weed up and started laughing
while I'm splashin in puddles like
muthafuck a struggle we dancin in the rain

[Chorus]
Dont nobody wanna dance slow in the rain
Just move yo ass. . . jus move yo ass
Dont nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain
Just move yo ass. . . jus move yo ass

[Verse 2]
Somtimes I hate takin trips to the lab
Got my pen and pad bookin instrumentals in smash
Catch the bus regardless
Trying hard to be an artist
but my A&amp;R be callin me out my zone into his office
being cautious cause hell when my records will break
askin me how he think my project progressin and shit
I said cool, but the truth is that I'm stressin a grip
cause it's hard to make music when this depression exists
they say use it as inspiration &amp; the best of 'em did
but I still see that I cant handle this pressure for shiit
and if you ask me stress is a bitich
my girl needs more pretention and record labels desperate for hits
now I'm pissed cause I'm gettin out the zone again 
makes me start to dread when I see a microphone and sh8t
and 'sposed to be like that
I said ill be right back
I left the office got a phone and called my partner Jack
and I asked him "remind me why'm rappin"
and right before he answered I remembered my passion in the past 
when I was scribblin in my tablet
to box out my mom and dad scrappin
to help me when my granmother passed
plus the many times I was homeless
and the times when I was broke
and the music made a way when I was hopless
he told me to remember the rain it'll deminish the pain
and he told me not to ask him again cause I know

*Chorus x2*

Dont nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain
Just move yo ass. . . jus move yo ass
Dont nobody wanna X3
Dance -- slow -- in -- the -- rain

*Chrous One More Time*</pre>
