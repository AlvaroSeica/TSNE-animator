[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
I will never flake on how you changed my life (no way, no way)
My minds a machine and its always in overdrive (watch out, watch out)

[mc chris]
Orwellian Corellian, a killer for credits
A temper tantrum phantom with the penchant for menace
I got a wicked head cold could somebody call the medics
So many cybernetics hallucinations and headaches
I was a stone cold daddy, I was so long gone
Young and stupid I was swoopin in the swamp with Han
Final lap it's a trap Solo sneaks up from behind
Got a forehead full of flames and I feared to cross the line
Brain was bashed, ride was smashed on a crystalline stem
I was fucked, out of luck, and I wished to be dead
But the Empire scooped me up they delivered me from hell
Filled my brain in hate and pain like a ghost in a shell
They took away compassion and my ability to care
Say they took my heart, but it wasn't ever there
And in that very place they put a more persistent rage
Sworn to kill the kid who put his thruster in my face

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
If you talkin trash then I'll throw it in the back
If you talkin smack then my Vulken's set on blast
Please don't mention Merc, it reminds me of my past
Yo they got their just desserts I deserted really fast
I became a bounty hunter though my bounty's often bodies
Seem to kill my conquest 'less the conquest is a hottie
There was one particular instance where they needed my help
A princess was in peril, people played by the pelt
Eradicate a general cause I'm cool with the fools errand
Liberate her people and maybe impress her parents
She made me feel deservin like my name was Alex Murphy
She's like "Nice to meet you Yoshimitsu no need to desert me"
But I had to hunt down Han, I was a man on a mission
We kissed goodbye I cried then that fucked up my system
Then I shuffled off to Hoth cause my plates are polar ready
Cool calm and collected underneath my suit I'm sweaty

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
I was pimpin in the district of the cumulonimbus
I was on the track of Solo cause my shit is persistent
I was three days late, Fett fooled with the 5000
But that's just great cause soon my dick found housin
I recognize a stripper under imperial rule
That ass had me flippin like inferior duels
I freed all the dancers, they boarded the Jumpmaster
It was like a party bus 'cept nobody was plastered
The ladies took control they put up a stripper pole
Put that shit on auto-pilot set that brain on rock and roll
But I'm still on lock and load, can't appreciate the princess
I need to go to Jabba's and finish up my business
I finally found Han, could confront the carbonite
Found I could care less, accidents are part of life
Saw my hoochie poppin coochie for some alien guy
Then Fett drugged me and drived me to the valley to die
A goner for sure they left my trooper plates in place
A simple act of kindness reminds us more than hate in space
My love she found me there, restin in Death's hand
We soon became betrothed Boba our best man
Cause I pulled him out the pit, one good turn deserves another
I nursed him back to health because he's my bounty hunter brother
We both been through this shit had our share of regrets
But at the end of the day I can definitely say I'm a fan of the Fetts
