[INTRO]
Wow, I like this, a little hip-hop mixed with a little bit of Rock n' Roll
I'm ready to do this right now (yeah yeah yeah)
Let's Rock Let's Rock Let's Roll Let's Roll
Let's Lose Control

[VERSE 1]
Let's get this party started y'all cuz I'm ready to rock
I got the crazy mad flows that'll rock ya block
It's the Macho Man who that wrestling dude
That's right ya betta clear the way I'm comin' through
I'm blowin' up the spot like some dynamite
You've seen me kick some butt now I'm rockin' da mic
I got the crowd crazy cuz they're feelin' the beat
You see I got mad flows that's why I'm hot on the streets
You can't compete I got the girls wavin' their hands
Startin' to dance I'm bout to put em all in a trance

[PRE-CHORUS]
So Let's Rock Let's Rock Let's Roll Let's Roll
Let's Lose Control

[CHORUS]

Come On Tear It Up Come on everybody Let's Lose Control

[VERSE 2]
You can't believe Macho Man's rockin' the crowd like this
Pound this hit in the club now they're pumpin' their fists
Haters are pissed cuz I got the mic in my hand
Now I got rap and rock plus my wrestlin' fans
Cuz the style that I'm kickin' is far from ordinary
Kinda scary Macho's skills extraordinary
Now it's my music that's in ya system thumpin'
You know I'm guaranteed to keep the party jumpin'
In the ring and on stage I'm well respected
On top of my game plus I'm well connected
