Song:   Far Out
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The following entry has uh seen mankind
complete it's first evolutionary steps into the universe
Leaving the planet earth and going forward into the universe

[Chorus: x2]
I'm Far out, off the chain, star route, I done lost the plane
Spit the bars out, with the quick of our mouth
Get the feeling of the tip, and let them take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out

Find me, I'm often low earth orbit
I'm far out now I'm talkin bout gotta get ready your gravity come towards it
I sky scrape jump up in the cloud and absorb it, rain down on you niggas like a storm hit
I'm headed for money and I'm sure of it, Important
You know that I'm dumb fresh, supafly, stupid high
Around business like suit &amp; tie
Tryna get paid like that youtube guy, I'm one of those dudes, that get to running you dudes
You gotta give him his dues, I'm incredible ya never gonna fill in my shoes
You can forget up a truth, cause I'm a beast when I get up in this booth (ow)
Ok, ok they know me now don't they, I'm glad to say
Tecca Ninna drinking turn me loose like J Obama way
So you know I gotta do it like I'm spazzin, I really get it crackin
never woulda imagined back when, felllas on the block got me rappin
with one of the illest niggas to ever make it happen
I'm often rides on less that flies on night
Don't get it I'm a better hater I'm gone eyes on the motherfuckin prize
And I won't get disturbed and come down from my throne
B-hood full effect stange ya diggin it, we living it up mane it's all about the bigga shit
Ready for the benefit, hands in the air if you feelin it

[Chorus x2]

I think I fit this track so perfect
tech &amp; nina gave me a chance and I deserve it
I been puttin in my work and cuttin like a surgeon
urgin my people to rebel like an insurgent
I grab my sword and shield talk on field
to feel my enemies pain the look in his eyes
Surprised realized denied by the stand up guy
you don't really want it with me please don't try
Plannin and ya archin the romanian guy
damn right dirty you can bet your live
And now it's time for me to make a sacrifice
so leave it like I see it I'm talkin after life
If this is wrong I can't be right
they want me dead but I stand alive
Enemies who post like my favorite 5
I duckin at em then I wave bye bye, I'm off my noodle ain't I?
And my secret ain't mine and I play fight
ain't white hate night in the daylight
You don't wanna be the one to catch that stain bright
so please proceed with caution
And just don't speak too loud
cause they go head-huntin in the Mississippi you found
they say I'm far out I'm a giant in this large crowd
get to fightin with my heart out
I feel your hatred like the far south
see the truth is everybody wants the money
But the fake it to make it if you pay ya taxin
Look at the way I'm comin out the middle of the map
and the tech the track with the ways of the?

[Chorus x2]</pre>
