[Chorus  2X]	
It all comes down to this
Will I wake up tomorrow to see the people I miss?
Open my eyes and feel the sun kiss
Or close my eyes and go back to rest

[Dirt Gritie]
I'm all stretched out of my frame
Lay on the canvas like I came out of Morison's brain
But to chill and do nothing is lame
Brotha's is talking, I can hear what their saying
#7 on your charts, Canadian made
Four time champion still my record ain't played
That's politics, I don't play that game
Leave the beefing up to 50 &amp; Game
Cause if maggots get to talking and I get that call
I'm at your crib, putting heads through a wall
It's MFM better known as Cash
Cause brothas got skills like Steve Nash
So I'm hated by the grimiest dudes
Respected by illest of crews
My fam be, on the alarm, when you press snooze
Arlo, said it before, we just can't lose

[Chorus  2X]	
It all comes down to this
Will I wake up tomorrow to see the people I miss?
Open my eyes and feel the sun kiss
Or close my eyes and go back to rest

[Bigga Nolte]
How you gon hate on Poli now
When we the first one's to bring you that new sound
The Slingshot made you jump and scream loud
And my fam is too strong you can't take down, we gon' stay proud
Honor and pride, always stay true
I got friends, but I only got a few
That's why for you, I do what I gotta do
Don't let them come through, try'na punk on my crew
Remember 92, it started with Straight Lace
Music would put a smile on your face
We kept moving forward and learned from the past
And it takes unity if you want to last
And we always gone blast, stay true to the Gods
If gone bring it, then we gone bring it hard
Get used to the smile, cause it's staying around
And I'm being good Ma, don't have to spank me now

[Chorus  2X]	
It all comes down to this
Will I wake up tomorrow to see the people I miss?
Open my eyes and feel the sun kiss
Or close my eyes and go back to rest

[Young Mav]	
Momma turn the heat up, my feets is cold
And the blanket ain't long enough to reach my toes
AT&amp;T gone cut the phone
Too many phone calls to family back home
Grandma prayed for us at her bed last night
So please don't cry, the Lord will stand by
Worn and withered by the strain of your job
But you'll see it through by the grace of God
I know you sacrificed and expected more
A lawyer, a doctor, I work with words
Hope for the lost, voice for the mute
Whose speech impediments force them to shoot
So if the weight of faith allows you to believe
A soul you can't see will provide your needs
Then the weight of faith should allow you to see
Your first child's video on BET

[Chorus  2X]	
It all comes down to this
Will I wake up tomorrow to see the people I miss?
Open my eyes and feel the sun kiss
Or close my eyes and go back to rest</pre>
