Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: x2]
Ey by now everybody breath the shit be end of this
With us even have a membership lovin me when I begin
To rippin to besome up when I hindet sinista nemesis
Cause I'm dreamin big I am at the end of what I'm fenna get
Intrecet finishit with death for the hizzbut I get no benefit
I am not a demon cause I'm always beemin on some sinista shit
This how we replenis this menace and glits took manevsshit
On my sindicate this genesis was spittin diminishiiit

[Chorus]
I've took all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
Who we bust they clap their hands
(Gun blast [x2]) clap clap till their hands is sore
And posibly could u be afraid of me
Be carefull who u fuckin with, boy don't let your ego trip

[Verse 2]
I can't stand no more like I was popeye, then I got my spenage
And now the industri drop by, when I rock the spot my pocks to
Be shot highin a dark sky in hops eye, will not die they really
Unscared of me they said that T will not fly and Craided was deaded
But he could'ntnetcle spitt up grock rise, dofta top eye will not lie
Bread is my fetish and I really get it that's why I'm a dreaded hip hop guy
So stop try do not pryor me and we won't have to bring the glock by nigga hot fry
Get ma me with a soft side lost wife, because the jammy did a manlike standin on pot pie
And now I keep bitches that'll make this hofby twat I be so paper that'll make the cops spy
And now the haters try'na mock my walk to the top die memakin they not I boss nine

[Chorus]
I've took all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
Who we bust they clap their hands
Clap clap till their hands is sore
And posibly could u be afraid of me
Be carefull who u fuckin with, boy don't let your ego trip</pre>
