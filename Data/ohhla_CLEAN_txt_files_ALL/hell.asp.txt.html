Song:  Hell
Typed by: AZ Lyrics


[Verse 1: ASAP Rocky]
We use to wear rugged boots now it's all tailored suits
Audemars Piguets for my criminal recruits
Champagne flutes, bumpin' rhythm and the blues
Partner made bad moves, he might end up in the news
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks
Riding by the rules I'll abide by it soon
See the situation we? sophisticated goons
Know you live by the gun then you die by it too
Niggas call me prophecy, swagging and philosophies
White on white wagon call that motherfucker Socrates
Rat ass nigga, fighting for a block of cheese
Catch me out in China stunning yea I'm about my guapanese
My shoe game serious, so serious, Whaup in these
Niggas say I'm blessed my bad I forgot to sneeze (achoo)
There your reasons go bitch
I got some tissues for your issues tell 'em blow this

[Chorus: Santigold]
People money watch, split ahead now
They countin every day down
Hittin on me long
You know your way, where you're headin now?
Me, I want everything
It won't take me long [x2]

[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky]
Roger, roger, tell em roger that
It's the gold teeth, French braids, call me Project Pat
With the stalky cap, face a mask on, probly strapped
It's the rocker cap, turn my swag on, holla back
Throw a dollar at a biddage, tell er suck my Diddy
Cuz they hatin on my clitty, cuz we made it when we did it
Hit it cuz they didn't
My mama always told me keep your mind on your money
Boy you better pay attention
Ride with the pretty nigga, woopty, no chauffeur
Paint lookin like a drippin smoothy, no coaster
The game if full of posers, big dog bulldozer
Flap up on em like toasters, wake them up like Folgers
Cuz heaven need a villain like hell need a newer idol
You could flip the crip and call just renew the title
For now I'm pro pimpin like them do what I do
Smoking killa but my doors still suicidal

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Santigold]
It will hit you on the head
You don't even gotta hit me now babe
Just as sheeps get led
You can see me long gone
How you gonna feel now? You know what they say
Really you know that we don't come how we get down
Knew that was a Rocky ahead
And you don't really what is up
No, you can't get it wrong

[Chorus x2]</pre>
