[Intro: Meko the Pharaoh]
Yeah, West Coast
Northstar, yeah
Killa Beez, what, what
Yeah, Northstar, what

[Meko the Pharaoh]
You don't wanna fuck with big Meko
I rock niggas like Cola, no baking soda
Just pure dope, no hope for them suckas
I hate punk muthafuckas, that love to lie
Choked up, smoked out, ready to die
I turn on the red light and let nine fly
Ya'll niggas better follow the rules, before my intelligence
Swallow your crews, that's how Northstar rock you
Shock you, knock if you off the mission, quick wishing
Dishing out the true edition
Meko got bombs, from the right dimension
Ya'll niggas better pay attention

[Chorus 2X: Christbearer]
Northstar, nigga, all in your world
Northstar, nigga, all in your world, yeah
Northstar, for the boys and girls
Northstar, for the boys and girls, what

[Holocaust]
Seven angels pull out their bulls, I'm hard nosed
I'll nail the poets back to the door with a jousting pole
I launch from afar, abnormal and bizarre
Esmeralda slid a frosty beer mug across the bar
And I laughed as I drank, in the red placed the deads
Then left the standoff with a man made out of heads
I drag my golden sword, through the grass that killed the stench
You might of seen me sipping on coffee by park bench
Battle with the mantipedes, I went upstairs
And busting shots down and broke you, like chairs
And chain MCs to torpedos, and expelled them
At the whistle stop cafe, punched the mailman
Cooking by the swimming pool, Warcloud is force
Meathooks sway in the cooler, back and forth
Old toys in the old toy room, fellow
I play you like a cello, at the beach under umbrello
Desert men, hell cops, shells rot and shells pop
As, I swing iron wild and drop the bell hop
And shattered all the glass and murdered your dirty ass
Laughed as I dashed and escaped through a car crash</pre>
