Got his bitch trippin' cause she seeing me
Thought she was off a trippy stick
Don't know why she sneak dissing me
Say he got a shrimpy dick

Pull off in that rari
Now they think I'm on some fishy shit
Two year ago I didn't have no car
I was on that come get me shit shit
Two years ago I didn't have no job
I was on that young drilla shit

Posted on the block with that Glock
Tryna drill some shit
Don't give no fuck that thot with the opps
I'm a drill a bitch
And I swear these opps know how I rock
Glo until I be killed

I don't want your bitch boy
Trying to see if I can fit my schedule with her
I won't wife a bitch boy
These bitches be going every where

I don't care bout going to jail
They treat me like heaven there
Before I let a nigga try and kill me
I'm a send his ass 11 shells</pre>
