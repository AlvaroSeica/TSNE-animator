Typed by: AZ Lyrics

When you get a lil' paper, get ready for haters
They standin' in line, they all suffer from vapors
I got me a ghost, I took off the tint
Bitch look at my face, I'm a grown ass man
I'm buying real estate and I'm buildin' my plans
Can't name a realer place, goin' gram for gram
And all the killas hate, know who the fuck I am
Look in a nigga face, watch me count my grams
My dog my trigga mate, and we bout them games
I'm talking trigga play never safe for lames
Just beat another charge, made 'em drop that case
My lawyers goin hard, a nigga versus the state
Just bought another car, had to drop that top
For 200 dollars, she'll suck that cock
Cause when you seen with me I'm a up that stock
I got that green with me, Gucci got those blocks
And then the cheese drippin, I like my nachos hot
As far as green niggaz, yeah you might get got
Breaking down my key, trying to see me the most
Greenhouse on the couch, nigga seeing me toast
Niggaz makin' the threats, you could put 'em on Twitter
But out of respect I handle mine like a killer
I'm runnin' the city like a pair of new J's
Maybe the patent 11's, I got these hoes in a daze
Panamera parade, sippin Cir'c lemonade
Baby drop me a eighth and baby boy straignt
In the back of the ghost, I can't hear no whispers
In the back of your mind you wanna be that nigga</pre>
