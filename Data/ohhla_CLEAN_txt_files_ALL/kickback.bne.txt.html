[Bizzy Bone]
Duckin the system and I'm wonderin if it's physical
Baby I'm feelin the fury and the money and it's still spiritual
Somebody tellin me why you hurtin me baby you hurtin yourself
Feelin the one I'm feelin the same, see you around the town passin me
Cause I'm a loner on the planet taken for granted
With only one body to manage, no knowledge I'm schizophrenic
Tellin me I should suck your johnson just to humble myself
Charles Bronson, strictly the victim, I'm comin in with stealth
Huh, who do you believe in? I believe in God Almighty
The prophets, the saints and the angels, Michael and son righteously
Don't ask me any questions after that, we ridin
Stack blame, bless Jacob the Jeweler, we not slidin
Bring work constantly, and get you 9 percent
And that's for your own protection, what do ya mean I don't pay rent?
So why should I have to suck it? I'm so fuckin +Thuggish Ruggish+
I'd rather fill my mouth with sharp-ass teeth so we both can love it
Fuck it, I go celibate, celebration of elements
My sentiments exactly, and exact me through these tenements
Testimony been done, repentance bein taken care of
Nobody to care for me? Well fuck it, I'm finna share love

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Baby go get your money, you're so lovey dovey
Concentrate on your paper, kick back, and sip bubbly
Don't let 'em search you, only talk to God
In a mirage, duck the ménage, and blahzay-blah (uhh, one time)
Baby go get your money, you're so lovey dovey
Concentrate on your paper, kick back, and sip bubbly
Don't let 'em search you, only talk to God
In a mirage, duck the ménage, and blahzay well blahzay-blah (one time)

[Layzie Bone]
It's a little bit safer during the day, when the kids is out to play
When them street lights come on, they better be takin they ass home
We do our dirt up under the sunlight but the moonlight is dimmer
January down to December, through the spring fall and winter
You learn to survive, in the ghetto, better break than get took
Sellin that yayo on the corner nigga better break or get booked
Look, po-po is on that ass, and them jackals is on that ass
Them crackheads they make the laws, but it's the niggaz you got to blast
They so cutthroat, they sheisty!
One-eighty-seven the lesson, the niggaz that's frontin they might be
The only way a nigga make it out the ghetto and that's real
Combat on contact, nigga kill or be killed - swear fo' God
Thug life is serious, my heart is near and dear to this
So many pause to understand this, I wanna smoke the cannibus
I can't forget the hood, they represent my struggle right
Money, women, power, respect; that's just a soldier's life

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
On that tropical, logical thinkin, E's an impossible
Probable, beer in the bottle, I'm full throttle
Unstoppble, jealousies make 'em envy my words
So they can think of somethin heinous to do, when I'm on the curve
Smoke herb with my closest family members and friends
Bend corners in the Lambo while I'm stackin them ends
One for the dub and the real, together always
And if the end of the world comes and we call V (call V)

[Layzie Bone]
Yeah we ridin Caddy coupes, stankin like it's Mercedes Benz
Malibu's and heavy Chevy's every day, I'm stackin ends
Some niggaz turn crumbs to bricks while other niggaz they fumble wit it
Make it out, start a business, while other niggaz they crumble wit it
Need work? Well come and get it, best believe that I got mine
I'ma represent for the O.G.'s and the hustlers that got time
City sets to the penitentiary, from one jungle to the next jungle
Lab breed beast, I'm always ready to rumble!
