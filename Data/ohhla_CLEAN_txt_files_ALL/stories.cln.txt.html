Intro:  Madd Ball
Yo JT, check this out, right: 'member back in the days niggas was 
skippin' shit, right, you know, fuckin' with the hoes and see we used 
to kick lil' rhymes and shit - hey, I want you to some of the SAME 
shit, man! ...
JT:  Uh!  One two!
Madd Ball:  Take us back in the days, I want you to do this one for all 
the boys 'round the way, you know what I'm sayin'?  Same shit 'bout 
all those stank bitches.

Verse 1:  JT Money
Hey yo, met a hoe named Sonia
Said "Hey, baby doll, let a nigga get on ya!"
She was with it, but one thing - 
She had one leg and walked with a cane
I couldn't tell 'cause she was sittin' real pretty
Bug fat ass and some FAT-ass titties +whistles+
When the hoe stood up, 
Trying to balance herself, I'm like, What the fuck!?
I was givin' her plenty play
I ain't wanted to be rude, so I fucked the hoe anyway
I only did what I could, +grunting+
'Cept for one thing about it, the pussy was good
I threw that leg to the ceiling,
Long-dicked the hoe, and the bitch started squealing
+"Ahh!   Ah!  Ah!  Ah!"+ 
Like a dog in pain, then the bitch
Started cummin' and yellin' out my name
+"Ahh, JT!!  JT!!  JT!!"+
Then she wrapped that leg 'round my waist,
Held me close and said cum in her face
Now you know I was wit' it
Put dick in her mouth, and the silly bitch BIT it!
Damn!  I pulled it out quick
+"God damn!  Stupid BITCH!+
Now I got teeth-marks 'round my dick
I hit that bitch like a man,
Mad as fuck, swollen dick in my hand
Now I'm in pain, so I 
Beat that bitch-ass with her own cane
+imitates beating noises+
Jumped in the Bronze,
Kept the bitch' cane and made that bitch hop home!

Madd Ball:  Ha ha ha ha!
JT:  And ya don't stop!  Silly bitch won't bite no dick no more!  
Madd Ball:  No dick, hoe!
JT:  Silly bitch won't bite no dick no more!  Crippled hoe, what you 
gon' do??
Madd Ball:  What you gon' do??  Hey man, that's the SAME shit, boy, 
that shit FUNKY!!  Hey man, ooh, lemme pass - pa -pass the fuckin' 
joint - go-o-o-od damn!  Kick one more, J!
JT:  Yo, check it out ... 

Verse 2:  JT Money
See a bitch on the bus stop, so I must stop
Conversate a bit, try to slay the bitch +"Yo, wussup baby, wussup baby?"+
See, I'm a nigga that's out to get it
And if the hoe down with it, best believe I'ma hit it
See, any hoe'll pass
I fucked this fat hoe with dimples in her ass
On heavy sense, dick hard as fuck
And all I seen was this fat-ass slut
I was only crackin' for a little head
Fat bitch' body slammed me on the bed
Then the bitch might've tried me
She got on top and tried to ride me +"Oh!!  Ohhhhhhhh!"+
Couldn't overthrow her; she was 300 plus,
Big fat greasy-ass stank ram slut! +Whew!+
And she refused to get up
&gt;From my chest to my knees was all wet up
Big bitch was a freak
She turned me over n' started lickin' up my butt-cheeks
+*lapping noises*+  Then I got into it
Said "Please!  Don't squeeze my ass when you do it! +"Oh shit!"+
She must not have liked the taste
'Cause she stopped eatin' ass when I farted in her face +"Thpppt!"+
But I ain't wanted to quit
I'm on that thing and with a hard-ass dick!
Bitch!  I ain't tryin' to play fussy
Pushed her on the bed and took that fat pussy!  Peace!

Madd Ball:  Go-od damn!
JT:  Ha ha, yeah, for 1992!  Yours truly, JT motherfuckin' 
Money the Bitchizer!
Madd Ball:  In the house. 
JT:  You know, yo, for the people out there who be wanna 
throw a nigga in jail, the lyrics in this song is, y'know what 
I'm sayin', fake shit names, nothin' but hoe stories ...
Madd Ball:  Fake shit; ain't for real!
JT:  ... I'm sendin' this one out to my manager Hop, you 
know what time it is, Hop!  One time for my nigga Madd 
Ball, Shorty T ...
Madd Ball:  It's your boy.
JT:  ... Uzi, my nigga Ram, one time for the whole Clan ...
Madd Ball:  Big nose!
JT:  ... my nigga Leveke on the beat, Eddie on the board ...
Madd Ball:  Blood claat Eddie!
JT:  ... yo, Poison Clan's signin' the fuck outta here.
Madd Ball:  And we outta this motherfucker just like that,
