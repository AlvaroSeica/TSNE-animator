Typed by: killasvann@hotmail.com

Come and sense better tell you to grind and hustle
Hit the streets like a mad, use your mind and muscle
We be all about the cream, living space age phantasies
Tryin to make my wallet green as a canapee
We beat them niggaz, hoes break to defense about
Tell them hoes how we beat that pussy inside out
I love it when you give me head in the benz
Up and down swallow, we gettin to win
Never bashing women just them hoes to be given
Headshots and whack knock to people for livin
Who am I ? Just another MC murderer
Judge citizen, all hip hop purgerer
To death make a loose with the micro
Hangin niggaz from his feet till the blood store
Drippin from the nose suffocating them weak hoe
Nobody want you knock the fuck around with Primro
Suave affiliated nigga, we get much respect
From niggaz with check and all the checks we collect
Let me tell you about this Suave House Fam shit
The only niggaz with the 4 in the hand prime shit
Give me the money and the hoes and the good weed
And the mic so I can practise killing MCs
Dark dreams still come back in full colour
Fire and big smoke, chokin motherfuckers
Hard pounded, the whizzle of the wind soundin
Like a woman screamin in a poo drownin
Am I insane from the frames givin to my brain
Eyes photograph all my people and their pain
Weak motherfuckers loosin and twist the game
See some bullshit and blow out their own brain
??? to the lies, arm full of ivys
Motherfuckers criticize and denie me
But who is the mad one? (who is the mad one)
Who is truely insane? (who is truely insane)
But who is the mad one? (who is the mad one)
Who is truely insane? (who is truely insane)
It's all on me, It's all on me
It's all on me, It's all on me</pre>
