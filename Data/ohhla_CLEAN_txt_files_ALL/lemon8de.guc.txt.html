[Gucci Mane - Verse 1ne]
My Phantom sittin on sixes, no 20's in my gum (NO!)
Your Curlass motor knockin, because it's a lem-on
I like dem Georgia Peaches, but you look more like a lem-on
These sour apple bitter bitches, I'm not fuckin wit dem
I'm truly stupid paid that's just how I feel today (today)
I'm movin slow 'cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade (lem-on!)
I'm standin in the shade and I'm sellin lemonade (lemon)
{?} a pint ago and raise off in the A (lem-on!)
Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in your face (BURR~!!)
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday (BURR~!!)
I'm pimpin whem I'm winn-on, that's just how I'm chill-on (lem-on!)
I'm smokin grits and sellin chickens, Corvette painted lemons
IT'S GUCCI! 

[Chorus]
Lemons on the chain wit the V-cuts  (Yeaaaaow...)
Lemons on the chain wit the V-cuts (BURR~!!)

Lemons in dey face, watch 'em freeze up  (BURR~!! BURR~!!)

[Gucci Mane - Verse 2wo]
I got lemonade and lemon tint
Lemons watch me mix the shit
Lemonade complexion, east Australian girl be killin me
She say I be killin her, I say I be feelin it
Four days then I'm sick of her, 'cause her brain is Lemonhead
Cocaine white exterior, interior lemonade (Gucci)
Yellow wit the off-white trimmin, I call that the super drank
Yellow diamond pinky ring, call that there the lemon rock (BURR~!!)
Jewelry box a lemon bin, my earring size an apricot (BURR~!!)
Yeah, I smoke dat strong alot, yeah I need some whatcha got
Half a pound of lemon kush, call that pack the lemon drop {*coughs*}
Canary yellow lemon watch, (BURR~!!) Big Bird yellow top 
Yellow Polo, Polo slippers, white and yellow Polo socks
"Gucci Mane be poppin dawg, he don't got all he say he got"
Just stash one lemon homie, I can supply dem the fifty glocks
Yellow boat parked at the dock, yellow bone gon' make it drop
Flip da flop, mine off the top, then go buy me a yellow yacht
IT's GUCCI!

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane - Verse 3hree]
Lemonade my town, house in Miami, I want yellow carpet
Woke up in the mornin, fuckin bought a yellow Aston Martin
Yellow bricks, yellow dust, yellow lean, yellow tusk
Yellow piss, spinnin whips, yellow weed, weed up wit us (Yaaaaah!)
Coward ass nigga, yellow stripe, you a yellowback
AK hit yo' dog, and you cain't, bring +Old Yeller+ back
Yep, Gucci banger, eighty-thousand, that's a yellow sack
Yello homes, Mello homes, you know you a scary cat
No sleep for two days, so my people lift me up
with five flights, six shows, quarter million on my schedule
Bangledesh and Gucci Mane, niggaz know they in trouble
Green ice, red light, Caution: Gucci rock yellow
GUCCI! (Gucci!) GUCCI!
