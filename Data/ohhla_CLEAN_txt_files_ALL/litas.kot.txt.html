[Daddy X - Talk]
Kings and kweens, stoners growers and tokers across the planet. put your litas
In the sky and fire it up for the KottonMouth Kings!!!

[Hook - Daddy X]
Put your litas, put your litas, put your litas in the sky. put your litas, put
Your litas, put your litas in the sky
[D-Loc over the hook] put em up, light em up, put em up light em up in the sky, put em up
Light em up, put em up light em up in the sky. [x4]

[D-Loc]
I smoke the bomb hits, we got that good ish, put your litas up so we can handle this
Business. I know you like it when the kings is in the building cause the buildings always
Smokin spinnin you can catch a feelin. listen to the beat while i'm bouncin through the track
Like a 6-4 lowrider sittin on some bags. let me pack another snap so I can pop pop pop pack
Another round so I can pop pop pop. you know how we do when the Mouth is in the house. when
You're drinkin in the back at the bar buggin out and you're trippin on the band tryin to figure
It out and you dont know what to think but you like the beats come on now. rock crowds-hold
Mics-smoke blunts-do stuff-smoke weed everyday-fuck the B.C. Bluff-make music for your
Trunks-banged out in the club got the people with the litas up

[Hook - Daddy X]
Put your litas, put your litas, put your litas in the sky. put your litas, put
Your litas, put your litas in the sky
[D-Loc over the hook] put em up, light em up, put em up light em up in the sky, put em up
Light em up, put em up light em up in the sky. [x4]

[J-Ric]
So many times ive been at a party and no one had a lita but I always keep a back-up in
My truck the bar-b-q kind, the ones you use to hit the 4-footers, cause matches got sulfur and
I hate smokin the wood ones. plus I hate Zippos cause they taste like gas, take a bong-bong hit
And make it taste like ass. my favorite thing to smoke weed with is Bics unless you gotta
Vaporizer than we're smokin outta that shit

[Daddy X]
I come from the zone, where we rip the bong, they call it "Toker's Town", down to
Fully toke. we got some indo, we got that homegrown, we got stoner klicks punk rock and
Juggalos, up in the cloud of smoke, is where we spit these flows, in the teardome, but you
Already know, so if you're at the show, where the speakers about to blow, put your litas in the
Sky and fire up some indo

[Hook - Daddy X]
Put your litas, put your litas, put your litas in the sky. put your litas, put
Your litas, put your litas in the sky
[D-Loc over the hook] put em up, light em up, put em up light em up in the sky, put em up
Light em up, put em up light em up in the sky. [x4]

[J-Ric]
Put your Bics in the air and flick your Zippos if you got em, hold your litas up high
If you get high. if you gotta pipe in your pocket or a "J" in your box of smokes make some
Noise and blow smoke in the sky, come on, when your so blasted it means you're smokin some weed
And when you're torqued it means that your bringin you to as high as can be, put your flames in
The atmosphere and let it be known if your a KottonMouth King hold down your throne

[Hook - Daddy X]
Put your litas, put your litas, put your litas in the sky. put your litas, put
Your litas, put your litas in the sky
[D-Loc over the hook] put em up, light em up, put em up light em up in the sky, put em up
Light em up, put em up light em up in the sky. [x4]

[Daddy X]
You can find us when our litas are igniting all the time, you can find us come and
Find us, you know we'll get you high. you can find us when our litas are igniting all the time
You can find us come and find us, put you're litas in the sky</pre>
