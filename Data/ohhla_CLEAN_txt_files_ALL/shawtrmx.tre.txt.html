From the first time we made love
I knew you were my shawty

cause you are my shawty
that's why I don't mind caken up with you
cause you are my shawty

cause you are my shawty

[Plies]
Don't call her shawty no more I call her my buss it baby
told her if she ever let me fuck I was gone run her crazy
I gave her some of this sweet meat now I got her craving
felt sorry for my baby how I left her shaking
told her don't move let me wipe you off baby
kissed her in the mouth and told her I love how she take it
put her head on my chest and fell asleep naked
she was shy when I met her but now she participating
keep the lights on so I can see her she amazing
sexy as hell I love to watch her while she baving
come and wake me up to help her when she shaving
she my bussy baby she smile when I say it

You know she bad cause she walk with her nose in the air
she fine in everything don't even matter what she wear
to get her started I just run my fingers through her hair
you know it's mine cause she let me give to her bare
I broke bread with her to show her a goon care
what I love about babe she turn me on anywhere
you know she bad she fucking you can't help but stare
I knew I had her when she told me "Bay I don't share"
I told her "Ne neither cause I don't put my tongue everywhere"
She asked me was it good to me? I told her hell yeah
I had to teach her a lil' bit, I took her from a square
I put my stamp on her it's all mine I made it clear
