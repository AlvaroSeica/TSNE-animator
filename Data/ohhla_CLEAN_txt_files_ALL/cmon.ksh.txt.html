Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Saw you leaning against that record machine
Saw the name of your band written on the marquee
It's a full moon tonight so we getting rowdy
Yeah we getting rowdy, g-g-getting rowdy
Feeling like I'm a high schooler
Sipping on a warm wine cooler
Hot 'cause the party don't stop
I'm in a crop top
Like I'm working at hooters
We been keeping it PG
But I wanna get a little frisky
Come gimme some of that yum, like a lollipop
Let me set you free

C'mon 'cause I know what I like
And you're looking just like my type
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Now don't even try to deny
We're both going home satisfied
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Write our names on the wall in the back of the bar
Steal some bubblegum from the corner Maximart
Yeah, we laughing like kids causing trouble in the dark
Causing trouble in the dark, t-t-trouble in the dark
Feeling like a saber-toothed tiger
Sipping on a warm budweiser
Touch me and give me that rush
Better pack a toothbrush
Gonna pull an all-nighter
We been keeping it kosher
But I wanna get it on for sure
Come gimme some of that yum like a lollipop
Baby don't be scared

C'mon 'cause I know what I like
And you're looking just like my type
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Now don't even try to deny
We're both going home satisfied
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

I don't wanna go to sleep
I wanna stay up all night
I wanna just screw around
I don't wanna think about
What's gonna be after this
I wanna just live right now
I don't wanna go to sleep
I wanna stay up all night
I wanna just screw around
I don't wanna think about
What's gonna be after this
I wanna just live right now

C'mon 'cause I know what I like
And you're looking just like my type
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Now don't even try to deny
We're both going home satisfied
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon</pre>
