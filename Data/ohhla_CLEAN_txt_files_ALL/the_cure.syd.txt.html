 siah: ah
 vocals rise
 from a localized setting and globalize
 hah
 yes: check it out
 siah: this is how we do it
 yes: 1-2

 siah: I leap from lily to lily
 never set type(?)
 funny how i sully the beauty of a valley though often tread light
 sunny though money has not begun to rain down on me
 It's a brand new day

 yes: and we stay makin melodies
 yeshua da poed'll be steadily tellin these fellas the time
 It's the present if you askin or bask in the sunshine
 or just unwind

 siah: into a summer time rush 
 of active kind of spastic actions my elastic faction 
 got a fraction of this earth sewn up
 rest calmly by the beach where we all have grown up

 yes: live by rhythms and beats with the microphone clutch
 flows zonin in on those that'll touch
 I play the background sippin much too much

 siah: riffin at such and such
 keepin my distance indifferent
 but with persistence the paradigm shifts

 {siah freestyling/talking in the background}

 siah: quietly keepin the peace, replenish our surroundings
 yes: drowned in release of breath, in depth oceanside
 siah: ......in the deep
 both: upon cliffs mad steep
 yes: open wide as we glide on the tide
 siah: cause it's a constant, despite monstrous uprooting and brooding
 beside the ocean, a motion for some order now
 nautical audible through recordable cassette
 yes: sort of a vet, brain soaking wet, using my jaw to project
 in order to set the content correct
 siah: so in the table of contents
 yes: you know which page to check
 siah: prepare the endeavor so i can sever ties quick
 and be spied in a remote, quote waterfall cave
 plottin the overthrow of the world with some girl
 or pumpin propaganda with my sonic brigade
 I gotta glisten and glade, my molecular clever
 specifically effects intellectual...

 yes: ....meanwhile find me either convincing non-believers
 or just coolin like a freezer
 see i leave a
 nuff time for rhyme and leisure
 wherever i happen to be, catching the breeze

 <fading out="">

 siah: it's like that
 we take you out....
 yes: like that
 siah: with the good feelings
 yes: what it's all about
 siah: It's what it's all about in 1998
 I said it so many times
 buy yo, i keep rhyming off the top of my melon
 said we're not gonna compete with it again
 but yo, i complete the blend, yeshua da po again
 like that full track/ yo i hit you in your whole back
 with the called facts opinions
 yo i got millions of writtens manhattan beach everybody
 yo blaze up to this
 yoooooooooooooo.....</fading></setting></pre>
