"Who's the chick with the muscles?"

[Makeba Mooncycle]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for the shit that I can't let go
All of the problems that I carry on my back
I get so mad, that I can't react
I'm living it, I'm up to new tricks
You need to get a grip, cuz I'm a fantastic
Take a gulp, not just a sip
Got something for the ones who have loose lips
Them same old pro's, them same old ho's
They think they brand new, with the same old flows
I slow up to restart my pens
Start with the one, ending up with a race
No rush, New York state of mind
Can't stop, now they say I'm running out of time
Superwoman, free the dumb, deaf and blind
Looking for the one, I heard he's hard to find
I'm out of sight, immune to Kryptonite
Yes, it's Superwoman, came to shed some light
Shook myself, got caught in the trap
Can't stop, won't stop, can't look back
I'm all grown up, came to save the world
When I was sixteen, they called me Supergirl
Supernova, the four leaf clover
When the sun finishes, you know the Moon takes over

[Chorus 2X: Makeba Mooncycle]
Just another little masterpiece
Well, you know that I strive for peace
I came out just to teach
One day, our souls will meet

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Sporting trends, platters, burberry
They soft like the cloth that they cop from Terry
I came to bury, watch all the kidneys scurry
Here to save the day, so don't you damn worry
I'm too sick, addict like chocolate
Came to change the game, from white to black chips
Don't blink, mistress of God ink
Climbing to the top, while ya'll about to sink
You were warned, I tried to put you on
There isn't nothing worse than a Superwoman scorn
I kick darts, I came to wreck shop
Watch heads bop, from mine to your block
I blew spots, lyrics like head grenades
Look at the losers as they running for shade
Sharp as a blade, spotless like Cascade
Looking for the ones who want to be saved
A featured attraction, queen of the parade
I will be here, until the end of the days
Extraordinary League, like X-Men
Leader of the sport, like path to Athens
I said it once, and I'll say it again
I'm like a pair of jeans, forever a trend
Beginning to end, I will ascend
Makeba is the one that you'll comprehend

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
