[Verse One: Ice-T]
I watch you everyday when you leave your building
I love the little outfits you wear
I know you wear them for me, God I want you
Since the day you first laid eyes on me
There was no doubt that you would be mine
You don't know me but I know you want me badly
Can't control your feelings, it hurts you so you shy away
You'll love me sooner or later, that's our destiny

[Chorus: Ernie C X2]
In my head.. You are my wife!
In my head.. You only want me!
In my head.. God has a plan!
In my head.. I am your man!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I watch you from my window
I see you when you sleep each night
I know you dream of me in your arms
I'll be there soon my love
You go to work, you pass me and you smile at me
That's just a little way, you choose to tease me and play

[Chorus: Ernie C X2]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I call you on the phone at night but never speak
I love to hear you breathe, it gives me chills
Your body seems so close to me
The other day I saw you with some guy, yo, who is he?
He needs to understand that you're my girl and he could die!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will! - I love you!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will! - You love me!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will! - He's not right for you!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will! - Don't do this to me!
Bitch!! Bitch!!

[Chorus: Ernie C X2]

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
I've Pictures of you pasted on my wall that I have taken of you
You walk your dog, I watch you in the shower
I bought a camera, binoculars and video
Your with me always, I love you more each hour
That you don't know me, that turns me on that much more
I know you know I watch you, you little teasing whore
One night soon, I'll introduce you to my flesh
You are the one God chose, though you don't know me yet!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will! - I love you!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will! - You love me!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will! - He's not right for you!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will! - Don't do this to me!</pre>
