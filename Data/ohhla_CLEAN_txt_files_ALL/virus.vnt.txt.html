[Vents]
My rhyme like a virus that modify what you're taught
Sodomise your thought, your brain wave contort
Twist your T cell, transmit the germ
Transfer the pain to your nerves to burn
My bacteria penetrate birth canal
So you predisposed to perverted sound
They put a serum in your vein to curb the strain
Press rewind, take in the germ again
Protein coat the cell, protect the rhyme
Bootlegging an epidemic, who next in line?
Enzyme infect, venom is in the deck
Pressing eject, your radio start to sweat
Temperature risen, organism react to stress
Damage your brain whenever the words manifest
I'm killing whatever, keeping you under the weather
till Re-Animator putting your body back together

[Chorus: 2X]
We reproduce, multiply like a virus
Death reside in your diets
Blinded by science, lost in the land of the giants
Doing my time with the tyrants

[Vents]
They keep running for vaccine to combat the tag team
Barefoot on the beach? Hell of a bad scene
Dentists gone mad, giving you bad dreams
Doctors terrify with tools that ain't clean
My virus designed to make clones to imitate
The strength of my plague survive on your dinner plate
The black death, bubonic outbreak
Wonder how long disease in the cow take to work
Checking your watch, wait around
till the men in the white coats strap you down
Germ warfare ain't a joke
unless you're George Bush, the Queen or you stay with the Pope
My DNA strand stay banned
Coming out your deck, turn your fucking town to a wasteland
If you thinking that the Vents trying to marry ya
Open up, get bumped by the carrier

[Chorus: 2X]

[Vents]
Hey, the Funkoars clique got the germ!
And the Hilltop crew caught the germ!
The Crossbred Mongrels got the germ!
My man Balboa caught the germ!
The Hospice Crew catching the germ!
Overproof caught the crew!
And the Terra Firma crew got the germ!
Of course the Vents, bro I got the germ!
Check it ouuuuut!
One, two, Vents One
Mr. Triiiials in effect like a virus
Moving real, real, real, real slow
Taking over, '06 and beyoooond!
Word 'em up</pre>
