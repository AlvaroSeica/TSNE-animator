[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Yeah we party 'til the sun up
You ain't likin what we doin? Shut up
You ain't likin what we doin? Shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up

[Steve G. Lover]
Fuck the recession, I'ma keep this thing goin
If you ain't know I bet you probably still work for 'em
Chick from Bermuda, that's right I get my work foreign
They don't get paid, I got hard dick and purp for 'em
Niggaz out of line, get a shovel in the dirt for 'em
Niggaz wanna move, get the trucks and the shirt for 'em
O.G. status, my job's got perks for 'em
Money, clothes, hoes, you ain't ever gotta search for 'em
You know what I'm doin, nigga I'ma do things
Gettin to the money, I guess I got a few things
Fifteen nines, five dimes, only two chains
Smoke like Jamaicans, run it like I'm Usain
Fresh from the haircut, down to the shoestrings
Hoes talk about me, I'ma need a new name
Steve G the prince, I'm lookin like the new king
All I do is win, so who the hell's losin?
What up?

[Chorus] - 2X

[Childish Gambino]
'Bino what the dealy, I heard that flow was silly
I heard you was so Eastside and that pussy your Achilles
But really it's time to get up, smokin on that get up
'Bino lay it down and work it out like a sit-up
I'm feeling like a winner, my livin be so easy
My old girl look Leona, my new girl look Yukimi
So illy I got espressos, mi mami give me besos
Shades on my face, Armani helping me lay low
D-Money get his name, these other niggaz lame
These niggaz used to hate me, I guess ain't nuttin changed
Shotgun in the Porsche, she don't know where we goin
American Royalty on that yolo Ralph Lauren
It's that city where Luda be, stuntin was new to me
But now we killin paper, fuck it I might just shoot a G
Leave your face open like you Breezy, I mean it
Nobody need to see nobody leakin, believe me

[Chorus] - 2X
