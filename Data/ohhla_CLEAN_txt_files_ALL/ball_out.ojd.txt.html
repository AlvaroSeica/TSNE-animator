Song:   Ballin Out the Gym
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Rivers, Dawyne, Wayne I be selling cake
Leverage Kobe Bryant, Pac is on, LeBron James
I'm ballin out the gym watch me do my thing
See the rings never played in NBA
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym

[Verse 1]
Reggie miller guns, they just love the shoe
Draw pockets swag only 4 bandz on my suit
Will come to shawty I hit her with my swoop
Michael Jordan ring, is it the shoes
Going white bricks we the bossy ain't shoes
Hard weight peel same colour as the shoes
Never play the sport but I'm ballin like a fool
With this NBA money fresh we oppian news

[Chorus]
Rivers, Dawyne, Wayne I be selling cake
Leverage Kobe Bryant, Pac is on, LeBron James
I'm ballin out the gym watch me do my thing
See the rings never played in NBA
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym

[Verse 2]
I think alot, I pick and roll
Now I'm in that coupe
Whip in hood just like da juice
Throwin up just like a gwaper
Used to average 28, now I average 36
Voices in my ear wassup the bricks, but all I hear is sweep
I got 3 hoes in 3 different houses
I average above the bitch
Step on 30 rich, I done mine cost 30 needs
German lean eyes 1 7 got me hella high
It's all in the rich put 4 quarters bag tide that's all

[Chorus]
Rivers, Dawyne, Wayne I be selling cake
Leverage Kobe Bryant, Pac is on, LeBron James
I'm ballin out the gym watch me do my thing
See the rings never played in NBA
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym

[Verse 3]
LeBron James forges, take a look the honey
Dawyne weigh gas, pal cost me 3000
Then roll wrists, I could buy some houses
Different name real, looking like a mountain
Water colour diamonds, looking like a foutain
Them white hour money, way taller than a tower
Watching the heat place, wouldn't write that to paraley
Busting salty gas, blacks one hundred took for cali

[Chorus]
Rivers, Dawyne, Wayne I be selling cake
Leverage Kobe Bryant, Pac is on, LeBron James
I'm ballin out the gym watch me do my thing
See the rings never played in NBA
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym
I'm ballin out the gym
Ballin ballin out the gym</pre>
