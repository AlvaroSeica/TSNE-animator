Como?! Yeah! Yeah!
Lil Jon! Eastside Boyz! (Que Vuelta!)
That little cuban from Miami, Pitbull!
I appreciate y'all giving me the oppurtunity to spit on this shit
GO HEADDDDDDDDD!

When it comes to these hoes
y'all know we on some halloween shit
start trickin' n treatin'
But I'm on some halloween shit too
gettin' messed up for the radication BOOM!
From the palm trees to the red clay
we get down the same way
Lil Jon's from Scott but this little cuban's
from the county of Dade
Pitbull is here to voice his opinion
and y'all gone hear it
All up and down the eastside
Im'a show y'all how dirty we ride
From Dade to Decatur
only difference is y'all blow dro
and we blow crip
but reall there's is no differecne
cause they're both green and sticky
I don't mean to be picky
but Jon, tell your boys from the Eastside
to put me down with one of those
redbone who has a pretty face, n waist
and thick thighs
From the M-I-A to the A-T-L
we been connecting on work
but keep that on the DL

HAA! Asi mismo brode! Como?!
Yeah, Lil Jon,  Eastside Boyz
P-I-T slash Q-B-O-N. Get it right baby
From the bottom, to the ATL
Haa! Decatur, Swat, College Park
Haa! Wynwood, Hialeah, Saweseraaa!
Liberty City, Carol City, Opa-Locka, this for y'all
Lil Haiti, Sao Pa Sai!
All my cubans, Que vola? Que vuelta? Que volon?
Haa! Yeah!</pre>
