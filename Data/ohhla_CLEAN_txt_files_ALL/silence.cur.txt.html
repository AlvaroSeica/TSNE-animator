[McKenzie Eddy]
So I see the setting sun and I get to feeling numb
Down on that side of town, back where no funs around
Back where I felt like me and everything you want to be
Just flows so easily, some I think may call it free
So cooooooooooooooooollllddddd
So So Coooooooooooolllddd
I cant believe you cooooooollllddd
So ooooooooooooooooooooo

[Curren$y]
Uh, Yea.
As the joint burns, o the point that it stinging my fingers
Tracks my talk show platform..
Part Phil Donahue part Jerry Springer
Momma come when I bring her.
She go where I send her
Kept it trill from the beginning
From square 1 maintain square business
Don't concern yourself with my minglin with other bitches
So crafty, mastered the flow Alaska cold
Silent foot assassin approach
High when I stroll
Not even leaving foot prints in the snow..
You know

[McKenzie Eddy]
Can't believe you cooooooolllllldddd
Soo ooooooooooooooo whooooooaaaa
So I see your face again, back where I've been travelin
Time.. I think it seems, to have its grip on me
Friends they say they call it for you
No matter what I offer you
Cant believe in history, living in this misery
So cooooooooooooooooolllllddddd
So So cooooooooooollllldddd
I cant believe you cooooollllllllllllddd
So cooooooooooooolllllddddd</pre>
