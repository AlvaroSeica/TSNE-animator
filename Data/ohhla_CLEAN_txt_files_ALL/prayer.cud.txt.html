[KiD CuDi]
Plain Pat, what up?

My heart thump not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God made me special here on purpose
So all the while 'til I'm gone make my words important so
If I slip away, if I die today the last thing you remember won't
Be about some apple bottom jeans with the boots with the fur
Baby, how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse, disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real...
Beyond from the heart, from the soul you can feel

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
And if I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take
But please don't cry, just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake I pray the lord my soul to take
Cause I'm ready for the funeral

[KiD CuDi]
My mind runs I can never catch it even if I got a head start
God please tell me I am feeling so alone way
I don't need to worry cause I know the world'll feel this nigga
Blessing in disguise, but I am not hiding who I am open your eyes, bro
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo..
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho, this shit is so ill...
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

[Chorus: KiD CuDI] (Repeat 2x)
And if I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take
But please don't cry, just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake I pray the lord my soul to take
Cause I'm ready for the funeral

[KiD CuDi]
I'm ready for the funeral, hey-hey
I'm ready for the funeral, hey
I'm ready for the funeral
Hey, I'm ready for it
I'm ready for it
I'm ready for the funeral...</pre>
