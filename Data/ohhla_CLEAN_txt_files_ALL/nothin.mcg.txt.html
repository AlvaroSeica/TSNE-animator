[Puffy]
aha aha yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Keep it movin' come on and keep it movin' [X4]

[Mic Geronimo]
Pimped out shine, boss to a tee
ask yourself can you ball like me
it's nothin that an amatuer can try to see
even hoes with the most step carefully, around me
abide by the rules you know
disturb my groove and you gots to lay low
Geronimo have it in the cut hogged tied
fucked up staring at gats from both sides
I stay high puff a pound or so
spearing the dough, accordly we run it,
how it go? Can't nobody hold me down
like my nigga Puff say, cut so sharp, you
think we sensei, Ima break it down audio display
with some help from the Bad Boys mic don't play
frontin' on my crew nigga crime don't pay
we back in ya face kickin' dirt all day
Protege niggas that rhyme, don't try
it's a fact, you've been hitted by the Master-I

Emcees wanna gun me and take my life from me
It's funny but still ain't nothin' move but the money
It's on...

[Chorus]
Times are hard? Times are rough? Feelin' like you had
enough, we can make it, gotta try
make a change, live your life

[Mic Geronimo]
Struggle for years is gone, I'm back fully on
with the tracks with the plagues we get illy on
niggas carry on while I'll place in funds
and makin' some, the value it make 'em run
grams and tons of rhymes, if you coppin one
let your man know, make sure he rockin one
Here it is in the cut, clientelle at the throat
the bomb shit blowin' like a bag of choke
mad you wrote a verse but it just don't fit
writtin' that shit with the niggas you running
to roll with, I told y'all Imma control
the world with this, microphone like a anthem, it just
don't miss give me somethin' to run with I'm on the block
all the niggas we hold you see they underlocked, still

Emcees wanna gun me and take my life from me
It's funny but still ain't nothin' move but the money
It's on...

[Chorus]
Times are hard? Times are rough? Feelin' like you had
enough, we can make it, gotta try
make a change, live your life

[Mic Geronimo]
Geronimo got it locked up like HDM, blowin' the
twenty with shortie in the grey B.M
gettin dirty after dark like 4 AM and strokin'
my little mami 'til her body say when
I'm more amazing then a Spielberg flick mix it with
a little bit of the Tarantino shit, Y'all need to
quit while you're movin' ahead, see we stoppin'
on the bank up in the game, enough said
a team so strong what can stop me now
y'all niggas better hope y'all top me now, and still

Emcees wanna gun me and take my life from me
It's funny but still ain't nothin' move but the money
It's on...

[Chorus]

Can't you see that what I mean is the mon-ey
Cant you see...

[Chorus 3X]

[Puff]
yeah yeah yeah yeah
Blunt records, Bad Boy collabo
