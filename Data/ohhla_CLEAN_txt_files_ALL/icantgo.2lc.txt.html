Chorus:  
(Mixx scratches "I can't go for that" and "nooo")

Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
Have you ever met a girl who dressed real fly
And wanted all the things that your money could buy?
She wanted gold chains, a brand new Louie
You gotta spend money to get that coochie
She'll find a man who thought he was raw 
Then leave him heartbroken when his money was no more
She'll get any man and treat him nice 
Now she wanted me, the Fresh Kid Ice
But I knew her game, and that's a fact
I'm sorry to say that ...

Chorus

Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
You're taking my kindness for a weakness
I find out your game with the quickness
I'm streetwise; I can see no good
'Cause that's the law in my neighborhood
You think that you're slick, and you can get over
But not on me, Marquis, your brother
When I first met you, you seemed to be different
Now you're askin' me for money?  I ain't with it!
You don't love me, so stop lyin'
Don't try to run a guilt-trip down by cryin'

Chorus

Verse 3
[FKI]  Women these days aren't realistic
         They'll drive a man crazy 'cause they're materialistic
         Always wantin' things we can't afford
         And when we say no, they pretend to be bored
[BM]   You can't fool me or see through me
         There's something about you that just gets to me
         You're scummin, and bummin', I hate to see you come and
         Want to get in my pockets?  You gets nothin'!
         "Baby, don't trip me," what's up with that?
         I ain't no sucka, I can't go for that!
