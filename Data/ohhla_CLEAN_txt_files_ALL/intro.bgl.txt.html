[Big L]
Yo; you know the game plan
C-Town, that's my main man
We never bring luggage, we go shoppin when the plane lands
Still run with the same clan, used to be a Kane fan
("Mmm, mmm, mm..") Everything I rock is name brand
L'll make ya dame swallow
Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin midget sips, I run with the richest clicks
Tap the thickest chicks, plus drop the slickest hits
You know nuttin about L, so don't doubt L
What's this motherfuckin rap game without L?
Yo, that's like jewels without ice
That's like china without rice
or the Holy Bible without Christ
or the Bulls without Mike
or crackheads without pipes
The Village without dykes
or hockey games without fights
Don't touch the mic if you unable to spit
Flamboyant is the label I'm with, motherfucker
