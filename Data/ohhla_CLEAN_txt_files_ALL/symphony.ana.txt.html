[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
You hear the angels?

[Inspectah Deck]
Cover me, I'm going in, there I go again
I soldier, there is none known to men holding him
Whether foe or friend, both of them, I've told 'em, I'm home again
It's on again, I know shit is real, I don't pretend
I'm not supposed to bend, or focus on scoping ends
Living out a movie, escape from the holding pens
A slot work'll cost you over ten, I see you
Through the scope lens, just when you think you closing in
And all around the world they know Slim
I never gave her money, but now and then, let her hold a gem
Like I drop at a soul descent, cover me, there's no repent
The chosen sin, peep the word and leave the master's dome bent
Only close to him, his closest kin
It's like being reincarnated, just to blow again
Wild snakes still closing in, smile with the cobra grin
Rebel lies, no defense, the war's on, load your M

[Phil Anastasia]
Aiyo, I'm nicer than Ned Flanders, this ain't no match-up
You act up, will slap your back up dancers
Answers from the wrong places, gangstas and pimps
Distort the image that's reflected in they tints
Since this hip hop has gone snap, crackle and pop
I'm dropping rock rap yo, Yacko, Wacko &amp; Dot
Animated maniacs, I have to go to the party
All on the rap game and you lames can't stop me
Back a forty and suburban, dropping verses
Got doctors and nurses, wrapping up some turbans
It's Suburban Commando, on some John Rambo
Belligerent, deliverance, I'm strumming my banjo
Flying off the handle, going sciszo, nuts
My mic's a needle, and a thread, I got the shit sown up
Jokers try to provoke me, like these kids don't suck
It's like Iron Man facing off with Gizmo Duck
You fucking jerk off...

[The Last American B-Boy]
I drink forty ounces and curse like a fucking sailor
Got locked up two times for drug paraphernalia
Staten Island son, grab the gun and never fail ya
Battle thugs in the street, rap nerds, I'll e-mail ya
Face it, the rap game just ain't what it used to be
Rhymes don't rhyme, and niggas flow very loosely
I got some season tickets so the B's are getting used to me
I'm bilingual, so I speak to both bitches fluently
Who that? I get on the mic, I say who that
There's only five niggas with rap flows who can do that
Before that I'm dead, I'm getting head like she knew that
Muthafuckas lying, so I hit 'em with the zoo raps
Animal bars, you rap stars are substitutions
Waiting for the governor, to stay your execution
Taking flicks, with a hell of a pose, that's only juicing
Fuck with niggas who drink, smoke and solicit prostitution, muthafucka

[Sean Price]
Yo, I take hard drugs, I graveyard thugs
Major league poison, I sell A-Rod drugs
Major league noise, from that AR slug
Five times a day, the God pray hard on the rug
I rap for respect, I rap for the love
I rap for a check, and you rap for the drugs
I rap cuz, niggas show the opposite of love
The opposite of hate, I pop a clip up in your face
I kill something, earth something, hurt something
Niggas is lame, they chain name worth nothing
Gold plated, colorful glass, that shit ass
Take it off, give the shit to your girl, that bitch trash
I'm a Slumdog Millionaire, that still ride the ferry boat
Tuna fish, bag of chips, and a fucking cherry coke
Bet he broke, bet he not, bet that nigga poor
Truthfully I'm stacking, duke, I'm ready for the war, P</pre>
