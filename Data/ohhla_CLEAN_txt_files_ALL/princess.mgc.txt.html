Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Will you be my princess
Can I love you lady
Pretty eyes you always drive me crazy
Will you be my princess
Can I love you lady (can I love you girl)
Pretty eyes, (can I make you my princess) you always drive me crazy

I think I meet about a million girls before I saw your face
And now I know I never ever be the same
Must be your smile
Maybe eyes and lips
Maybe all just wrapped into one
Cause girl you got me breathing fast and thinking slow
Making plans to never let you go
And if we make a promise girl I'll never lie
Be together till we 95
Maybe you never had a man that understands
The things that make you happy girl
But I can be the one to change it all cause seems to me you just so beautiful
So when your ready for somebody who can really
Love you right
Give me a call and I can be the one to love you girl until the morning light

[Chorus]
Will you be my princess
Can I love you lady
Pretty eyes you always drive me crazy [x2]

You drove me crazy
From the first kiss to the first touch
To the first time that we made some love
And now I'm giving you my heart my days and nights
Like music girl you change my life
Whenever whatever you need you can count on me
Just sprinkle me with all your ecstasy
Eres princesse de los cielos y por so yo te quiero
I know I'll never find another girl like you cause I ain't lookin
Baby I'm tooken you dig
Play this once again show it to your friends tell em you and me
We ride until the end
Cause you my girl keeper of my world on top of this
The most beautiful
My heart my soul and all my kisses for you
My princess

[Chorus]
Will you be my princess
Can I love you lady
Pretty eyes you always drive me crazy [x2]</pre>
