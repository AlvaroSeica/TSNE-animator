[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Now's the time for you to show yo' ass
They ain't handin out no mo' cash
Mommas imitate my logo fast
Daddies take the safety off and blast

[Boots]
Now this is mo' mean than fo' fiends with glocks unloading
Scrappin for a bag of gold rings and codeine
Whole life savings hid under the molding
"Mama Said Knock Them Out" and I'm quoting
You're voting which you're hoping
will stop the guns from smoking - is someone fucking joking?
They're bonkers in sheep's clothing
I know places where the kids keep crooking
Lacking the essential vitamins and protein
Hustlin and hyphy are eloping
I'm the best man bustin shots and toasting
Sippin Grey Goose get clipped off the bird
COme Sunday mornin get tripped off the word
TV and them preachers got pimp talkin verbs
Settin us up to get ripped off and stirred
You flipped all them birds so your funds act right
Here come the drought whole thang's half price
My high school career counselor's advice
"Lil' niggaz act nice for your beans and rice"
I got some fight baby, take it to the head
I gives a fuck if it's permed or in dreads
Never snitch to the locals or the feds
See they tryna break us off so they don't have to break bread
Cause Uncle Same ain't the baker, he's the butcher
We all on "Punk'd" with no Ashton Kutcher
Where ballin (no broke) cutthroats kaput ya
Ain't never took dope but them dopes done took ya
Stop flyin Ol' Glory man, cut it down
If your job ain't payin right, shut it down
If your cat got 18's, let it pound
and if we ever gon' do it let's do it now

[Chorus]

[Boots]
You're in a system where they flirt with disaster
Tounge kiss death, have mass murder orgies 'til there's no one left
They're finger-fuckign Lady Liberty under her dress
And since I didn't say this under my breath
I might be under arrest; now lemme introduce
My slave name's Ray Riley, you can call me Boots
Cause we gon' boot 'em outta power then spread the loot
We need to drive that freedom train, not ride caboose
And you can tell by the way I walk my walk
That there's a coroner behind me holdin chalk
Cause he works for the county who works for the state
Who works for the boss man eatin off your plate
We ain't one dimensional, max-detentional
Lookin for the liquor store, what them hubbas hittin fo'?
We raised by the street light, praised for the street fight
Days we ain't eat right, hazed to complete life
Had to make homes outta muck and dirt
Just to get dinner take luck and work
They don't need my rights, they induct a curse
So you're cordially invited to go buck berzerk and um

[Chorus]

[Boots - repeat 2X]
The black is heated; baby, yeah
A hundred Fahrenheit
Act a fool, show yo' ass
Let's make it alright

[Boots - repeat 4X]
It's introduction of a new breed of leaders
Stand up organize

[Boots - repeat 2X]
The black is heated; baby, yeah
A hundred Fahrenheit
Act a fool, show yo' ass
Let's make it alright</pre>
