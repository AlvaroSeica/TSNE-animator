[Andy Cooper]
You lie still, the walls are closing in again
Unable to summon any adrenaline
Without passion, limping on your last limb
but you'd still run from interaction
Cause all people do is pick at the scab
Bringing up a conflict that they think you may have
So, when they asked you laughed and lied
And they were pacified, but it was trapped inside
When you were younger, man you would have mocked this
Cracked a snap and called it all softness
But look at you now, a walking ghost
Trying to fight your way off the ropes

But in that room it's only you and all your secrets
Remaining calm and you don't wanna fall to pieces (Nope, nope, nope)
But when it's dark you just might start to get ideas
You'll say your strong and moving on
But you don't need this feeling

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
Tonight, we are the lonely ones
The lights go out the show is done
So lock your door and bite your tongue
Tonight, we are the lonely ones

Break!

[Dizzy Dustin]
This time around I specifically wrote
on a slippery slope cause I typically joke
So here I am standing on the middle of the Grand Canyon
with no companion, echoes at random
I'm alone with the shadows cold and scared
It's like losing sight when you're hearing impaired
Just running (Runnin) unseen like a sasquatch
Feeling lost in the crash like the black box
I keep thinking about all my flaws
Frozen inside and I can't be thawed
So put me on an iceberg, push me away
To hide in the horizon fading to gray

I'd like to get this off my chest, it's complicated
I start to speak and feel relief, but I can't say it (Nope)
I hide the truth or stay aloof and isolated
And think I'm strong and moving on, but I can't shake this feeling

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
Tonight, we are the lonely ones
The lights go out the show is done
So lock your door and bite your tongue
Tonight, we are the lonely ones

[Andy Cooper]
Tonight, we are the lonely ones
Tonight, we are the lonely ones
Tonight, we are the lonely ones
Tonight, we are alone
Bring it back!
We are the lonely ones
We are the lonely ones
We are the lonely ones
We are the lonely ones
We are the lonely ones
We are the lonely ones</pre>
