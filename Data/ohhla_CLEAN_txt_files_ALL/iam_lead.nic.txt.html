Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Nicki Minaj]
Look sucker, this my gun-buttah
+Street Fighter+ bitches, this the up-cutter
Nunchuk-ah, no time to duck-ah
Sign of the cross, cause this is her last supper
Play with me, check who came with me
I bought a couple nine, plus the K's with me
I breeze through queens to check some bad bitches
I stunt so hard, assess the dam-ages
Cause this that oh, this is that oh
And yes I body bitches, go get the ban-dages
Yo-yo-y-young yummy, fuck you got for me?
I hate a phoney bitch that front that chum-chummy
I'm me top shotter, drop the top-topper
Big fat pussy, with a icy watch

[Chorus]
I am your leader, yes I am your leader
You not a believer, suck a big dick!!

[Nicki Minaj]
When I fly, it's one letter and one number
You whack hoes could get hot for one summer
After that the queen'll still reign here
I'm Santa Claus to these hoes without a reindeer
Saint Nick, Ross, hey Rick!
I just got a toy, cost 850
Now I'm in the hood, niggaz is gettin woodies
Hit up Hot Topic, Nicki Minaj hoodies
I'm-I'm-I'm a brand, bitch~! I'm a BRAND
Go to Harlem, and get Cam
It's DipSet, get your dick wet
Boarded the big jet, and got a big check
Now you tell me, who the fuck is winnin?
I'm on my Russell Simmons, Nicki denim Nicki linen

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Ugghh! Jealous niggaz just gossip, watch me tie up my laces
Ugghh! Bitches be jockin, tell by the look on they faces
Eight digits I'm clocking, a lot of gold in my bracelet
Seven figures on watches, I told my momma I made it
Made a deal for my project, just give me ten mill' I'm gravy
I went back to the projects, did two mill' in Mercedes
I get head from your lady, have her bill me later
I'm a school with the hustle, just gave Rhianna my pager
Heartbreak H	otel, I'm in that A-Rod suite
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talkin playoff seat
Know that boy busy ballin, I like to play all week
Monday night with the +Raw+, I'm +Vince McMahon+ with the beat
Powerslammin them hammers, I get you handled for free
So where the fuck is her manners? She gives brain while I tweet

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross over Chorus]
DM, in the BM, you see 'em
The bucket, you love it, motherfuckers on my dick suck it!

[Chorus]

[Cam'Ron]
Uh~! See the car is European but got imported from Tokyo
Lookin like a shark, the nose call it Pinocchio
Well off, wealthy, LV, logo
Middle of July but the wrist on snow-flow
Only do the Aspens, y'all can have the Poconos
(Y'all can have that!) I'm Sonny and you my son (could loan ya doe)
Ride the whip, five on the hip
Live with the pies got nine for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick
Oh my know why I'm fly as it gets
Now I need an aspirin, she said "You're only Cam'Ron!"
Girlfriend you don't know Cam'Ron from nowhere so don't go tamperin
You just a nail I hammered, 'nother girl that's on my camera
My name you cannot slander at all girl, watch your manners
She run and tell her mother, "I think I love him na-na!"
Because you sat up on my lap? Nah, I ain't Santa

[Chorus]

[Cam'Ron over Chorus]
Hope they call me Pied Piper, OJ no glove I knife her
Never be a lifer, even do Rikers, why would I fight her? Don't even like her

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
