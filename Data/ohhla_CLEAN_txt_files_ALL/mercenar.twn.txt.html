[Lone Ninja]
specialize in combat, contract killer
Arms stacked, bombs blasts villas
Palm cracks pillars and it smashes statues
Slash, whathaveyou clash like a savage manchu			
Can dismantle cliques in the blink of an eye
Slam your battle ship as it sinks in the tide				
Slaughter viciously, ruthless, War 
For centuries, truce nixed, Call your infantry units			
Fuse lit, on explosive device
Slew swift, I'm atrocious with knife			
It's hopeless to fight, ninja wins rapidly
Ferocious with might from discipline factories			
Killing many martyers in military 
Quarters, artillery and torture					
Lurk and many panic, versed in deadly havoc
The firmest sentry, in mercenary barracks				

[June Marx]
Assault amphibious, your squadron oblivious
My theory is, to bomb interiors
Calm and serious, thoughts browsing scripts
Marx sounds emits, launch a thousand ships
Haunt and prowl the mist, reconaissance
Each continent we seek dominance
Fleet conquering, slay the main attraction
Fatal faction, taking evasive action
Naval cannon, satellite imagery
Paradise turn to afterlife instantly,
Sacrifice infantry, axes slice, craft precise
You aint half as nice Lyrically
Candlelight soliloquy, on the brink of war
Illegal arms imported out of singapore
More drinks to pour,for a tragic end
The gasmask and balaclava back again</pre>
