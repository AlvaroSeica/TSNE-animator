Song:   Plant a Seed
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Daddy X]
You know all life comes from a seed, and that goes for you and it definatly goes for me

[Richter]
I stare into the fire, and watch the flames go towards the sky (whooaaa)
And I can't help but wonder, what this tree did to die (whooaa)
So I took its ashes and mix them with dirt and dropped a seed (yeeaah)
And it made me think, I gotta thank my mom and dad for makin' me

[Chorus]
You need to plant for the future
Plant for the children
Plant for you and me
You gotta plant for tommorow
Plant for the harvest
You got to plant your seed

[Richter]
We all come from our fathers
And live off the harvest
From people plantin' trees
And we depend on each other
To nurture our mother
Earth so won't you please
Stand with your brother
Stick up for your mother
Gotta turn our wrongs to rights
Too many humans on the land
That just dont understand
What its gonna be like in 2025
We need to plant now to help our planet grow
And yes its very important that everybody knows
The situation that were headin for
Is one that we are creating
And the future is our goal

[Chorus]
You need to plant for the future
Plant for the children
Plant for you and me
You gotta plant for tommorow
Plant for the harvest
You got to plant your seed

[Daddy X]
Im a subnoize soulja, I got peace on my mind
We got the next generation just waitin here in line
See im a freedom fighter I keep fightin all the time
No ones promised tomorrow, so I gots to go for mine
Everybody thinks about tomorrow
([Richter] yeah they think about tomorrow)
Everybody needs some room to breath
([Richter] we all need some room to breath)
We dont got no time left tomorrow
([Richter] noooooooooooooooooo)
If you agree, its time to plant your seed

[D-Loc]
Pursuit my dreams in the fast lane
One day it'l weigh
Plant seeds in the meanwhile
Watch em' grow today
Make a change to a nation
That needs a safer place
Now when ya make a difference with the people
Theres no one else to blame
We all need to plant seeds and make a change
We all need to plant seeds and make a change
To save this place

[Chorus X2]
You need to plant for the future
Plant for the children
Plant for you and me
You gotta plant for tommorow
Plant for the harvest
You got to plant your seed</pre>
