[Soul IV Real]
Our father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On Earth, as it is in heaven

Give us this day, our daily bread
We give up our trespasses
And even those who trespass against us

Lead us from temptation, deliver us from evil
For God is the kingdom, power and glory
Forever and ever, amen!

I love you uncle Heavy</pre>
