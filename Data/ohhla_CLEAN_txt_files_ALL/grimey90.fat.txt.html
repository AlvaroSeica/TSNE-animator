[Intro]
Yeah! Uh!

[Verse One]
It's a cold world colder if your skin colored
Charge me for bein armed with a street corner
In the blocks where we reside ain't no neighborhood watch
Just us, bakin pies try cook me a watch
Try bake me a bands a like my nigga 'ye said
Make a spaceship so I could fly up outta this bitch
Now my baby girl's stressin 'cause her dad locked up
Baby mama came to visit 'nother bitch popped up
Nightmares of a convict, Brook Ave prepared me for any conflict
Shook hands with every kingpin from Harlem The Bronx in fact
'Round the time Von Zip nicknamed me crack
Now how ill is that, my nigga told ya what he said
If he ever caught her he'll shoot up the precinct
Oh Lord!!! I pray the Lord forgive her
So Lord!!! But thank you for the dope and what it bring us

[Interlude: Scratchin]
Grimey in the early 90's-9-9-90's-"Fat Joe"
G-Gr-Grimey in the early 90's, far behind me not hard to find me-"Fat Joe"
G-G-Grimey in the early 90's-9-9-90's-"Fat Joe"
G-Gr-Grimey in the early 90's, far behind me not hard to find me-"Fat Joe"

[Verse Two]
I hate bitches, fake bitches, snake bitches
But I love the plastic surgeons that create bitches
Columbiana cakes test the product take a taste
Titties bouncin like immigrants up over the gates
Silicon in 'em then I'm up in 'em
Got an ass or not, get that ass a shot
Uh! Pardon the vanity Versace on the masterpiece
No tellin where the handles be when I pull up
Back to back 50 whips thats crew love
In B.K. with M.O.P. yeah that's true love
For the nigga ain't ready yet! D. Rose
Bet a nigga movin heavy weight! Kilos

[Outro]
It's Coca baby! La Cosa Nostra baby!
Uh! Follow the don it's motto of the song
Follow the don it's motto of the song
