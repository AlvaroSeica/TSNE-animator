[Intro]
Damn who knocking on the fucking door like that, shit
I think that's our little friend
Hold on man, let me get that
Hehe, damn
Took for ever, step on in, let me holla
Yeah
Put your coat right there
Little mama say whats up to my baby
Get acquainted
Here's your new best friend
Damn, lay down right there
Chocolate and caramel, best of both worlds
She got nice lips
She got a body on her right there
My children
Baby, touch me right there
(Right there?)
(You like that?)
(Yeah)
Now mama lets see what mama taste like
Tell me what she taste like
Damn

[Verse]
Sippin' on that henny got me going crazy
With two ladies
Looking so good, don't you want to be my baby
You lay it down don't play around don't make a sound
Let me see that ass bounce
Yeah
And I want you to kiss her
And I want you to kiss her back
Oooooo girl just move girl
I want you to move it just like that
Damn baby, you can move it so good
I like the way you talk
I like the way you move
I like the way you scream
I like the way you do what yo do
The way you talk to me
The way you talk
The way you talk to me
The way you talk

[Outro]
