Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

This one goin out to, all these bitch niggaz
Talk shit 'bout me, 'bout my clique
Talk about how much WE bullshittin, knahmsayin
You gotta get yo' shit together, shit

You ain't got yo'self together and +I'm+ bullshittin
I got cash, you broke, still I'm bullshittin
Listen, I could give a FUCK about what
you do, and you do this, what
is it, my man, you know that I don't play
{De La Soul sample of Pos: "I don't, I don't, I don't play
And if you take offense FUCK IT~! Got to be that way, J.D."}
