[Salute]
If you digest my flow, shit will hit your spot
I spit from the wrist nigga meaning I'm hot
No need to worry, need to question all the shit that I got
Became a vet, real humble, laying low on the block
Ain't been the same since my mama fell short to a shot
The sexy gone and I'm living the pain won't stop
Move out the 'jects but a nigga still carry a glock
So if you run up on me ill-advised you're sure to get popped
A 9 to 5, game's slow, so I turned to drugs
All day on the grind, making moves with thugs
No turning back, 'cause the game got a nigga too deep
Seeing faces, hearing voices from the shots in my sleep
The weed smoke keep me insane but it calms the pain
But when the highway's off just the same old thing
Niggas dying, bitches lying, still I'm trapped in the shell
Though I'm living the flesh, my soul's dying in hell
Holla at ya man!</pre>
