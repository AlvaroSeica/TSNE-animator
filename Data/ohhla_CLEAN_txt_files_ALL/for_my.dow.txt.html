Cause you're a mother fucker
I put my life on the line everyday, every night for any homie of mine
Whys that? Cause you're a mother fucker
I put my life on the line everyday, every night for any homie of mine
Let me tell you why

[Mr. Shadow]
When I was broke and didn't have a fucking dime
You looked our for a homie not wasting time
A lot of fake mother fuckers play a role of a friend
But inside they just pose trying to see your end
I spend hours thinking about this life of ours
And how it's full of nothing but conniving ass cowards (huh)
I put my life on the line for any homie of mine
Any day, any place at any given time
Sunrise to son down all year round
Till the day I hit the ground I'm down for ya
 I'm letting all my dogs know, I'm there for ya
In California were we get a grind on stay strong
We ain't stupid we play along (Ha-ha)
There ain't nothing in this world I wouldn't do for ya
I'll tell you why (why's that) cause you my motherfucker

[Chorus]
I put my life on the line everyday, every night for any homie of mine
Why's that? Cause you're a mother fucker
I put my life on the line everyday, every night for any homie of mine
Let me tell you why (Why's that?) Cause you're a Mother Fucker


[Mr. Shadow]
If somebody got drama (what)
Tell em to bring it on
And let them silly sons of bitches know you ain't alone
You got your shadow right behind you &amp; don't forget that
Mutha fuck anybody who don't respect that
They can hate all they want
We'll get em up with any punk fuck wherever they form shit
Chump change can make a hatters act strange
Jealousy is for bitches it'll never change
I got your back and you got mine
I'm down to ride on any trick trying to get out of line
No doubt, I'ma let my mutha fuckers know
There's nobody like us and that's fo sho
So Cal we all in the mix now
Getting pay for every eight fuck ah freestyle
In the mean while I'ma lay back with the sack
And get my puff on for all my mutha fuckers

[Chorus]

Yeah we had hard times we did crime together
Always told each other shit can only get better
And now it's better
With ever-single move we make
Every step that we take is a trip to the bank
I thank the lord up above for blessing my life
With some real mother fuckers two kids and a wife
Its like good things come to those that wait
So don't lose your patients don't lose your fate
Take your time do it right no need to rush
I want more than a little bit and more than enough
Me and my dogs do things till the wheels fall off
All you pity mother fuckers rather run your jaw (we came to ball)
Fuck what'chu talking about, Silly bitches stay dumb with a dick in they mouth
Right now I'ma take another hit for ya
And you should already know that you's a motherfucker

[Chorus]</pre>
