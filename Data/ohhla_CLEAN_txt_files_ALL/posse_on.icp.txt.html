Insane Clown Posse!
ICP! about to take you way back! way back that is, to Vernor!

Posse, Yeah!
Me and Shaggy 2 Dope in the home away from home
In the black bucket hearse with the rusty grill a chrome
Pickin up the homies, we get em one by one
If you aint psychopathic ryda boy you cannot dump (bump)
Everybody's lookin if you jealous turn around
Fuckin with them leathers got us hoppin off the ground {*Honk*}
We getting good grip from the 50 series tires
The alpines bumpin but I need the volume higher
Cuz the 808 kick drum make you wanna get some
I got a scrodum full a balls I let your girlie lick them
Every time we rollin Twiztid's gotta roll a joint
I almost died from inhilation comin back from Cedar's Point
Hookers and zombies in every direction
Lookin for the wavin for some action
The wagons kinda crowded though
????????
Jamie tryin to keep it steady with the greeny on his lap
Rude Boy wasn't lookin, we hit a crack head
Flippin off the windshield, the motherfucker's dead
Zombie cut in half, look out of regret
Insane Clown Posse rippin up shit
Woo! Woo!

Psychopathic Sodiers Roll
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (Yeah, come on)
Down riverside that's how we ryde
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (ICP!)

Runnin down bass and seven more scored
Half an hour later we was getting kinda bored
Jump Steady's dangerous, Dougy is 4 Rilla
My homie Shaggy 2 Dope is the bitch hater killa
Billy's on the left side coughin helly ..
Leavin haters lady crawlin pickin up they teeth
Tom Dub is the skinny guy
People think he's funny
But he didn't even know tonight he comin back bloody
Cruisin Del Ray boy these streets is cold
Cigerette lighter broken window stuck unrolled
Rippin Michigan we saw .. thugs
Me muggin hoes shoppin
Distributin drugs
Hittin 3 and 7 and that ass just dropped *Honk*
Squeekin and we ..
But the wagon don't stop
Michigan ..
Rudy broke left, Jamie shot a verner
It's time to get wrecked
Junky on the corner, need a box of shoots
With a rebel flag and some cowboy boots
The closer that we get, the clearer it became
It was Kid Rock yellin "What's my Name!?"

.. Toxic Sludge Warrior
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (Yeah, Come on)
.. back down to Southwest
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (What you got?)

Now cruisin down Verner
My wheels spin slow
Runnin with the hatchet is the only way to go
Some girlies by the Carnival was lookin for a ride
We tried to pick em up
But we had no room inside
We put em in the trunk, we put em on the hoods
Some sat up with the Rude Boy and puffed on his wood
Our crew is gettin bigger, and there's way to many freeks
The muffler's draggin and the tailpipes weak
Now these hoes are gettin hungry
Monoxide's treatin
We stopped at .. for some mexican eatin
The restruant was closed, this ho was like "Damn it."
She said "Go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Seven."
Now I finally see the place, it's a little run down
But they got the best Chilly Cheesy in town
Faygo on tap, any kind you choose
After midnight though the place is bad news
.. and didn't even..
This ho from another crew she picked it up and used it
Her boyfriend's trippin and jumpin on her case
My homie Billy Bill had to bust him in the face
We never like a fuck, who beats on his girl
If ya don't have a game, then .. leave our world
Aint nothin to discuss, the bitch slept with us
She fucked everybody now I hard she lives with Russ
Now I'm runnin with a hatchet, and you walkin with some dudes
The Psychopathic Family is givin you the blues
Hate us all you want, cuz we don't get upset
Insane Clown Posse, bitch represent! (Come On)

Psychopathic holdin it down for Southwest
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (Yeah! Whut!)
Dumpin dead bodies behind the Del Ray Caf√©
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (Southwest buddy!)
Fuckin bitches on the grass on in Paton
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (ICP!)
Forks up, forks down, forks all the way down
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (Yeah! Come on!)
Killas, stalkers, outline body chalks
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
.. Turn you right back right around
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (Wicked Clowns!)
.. cars
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (Yeah! Come on!)
Inner City Posse's still alive, bitch!
THE POSSE'S ON VERNOR! (Southwest! Southwest!)</pre>
