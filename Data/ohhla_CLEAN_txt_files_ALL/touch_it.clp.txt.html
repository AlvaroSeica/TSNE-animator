[Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
or just kiss it, kiss it
Shit, do something~!
Do something~!
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
or just kiss it, kiss it?
Shit, do something~!
Do something~!

[Pusha T]
Uh, please, pretty please
I just wanna see you down on your pretty knees
or maybe you could touch it, see where it leads
Go 'head, just +Beat It+ like you was Billy Jean
You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend
That coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need
You in college now, so you too old to tease
I'm hoping you can polish like Pledge, what I need
And I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed
cause I'll return the favor like we playing to the screen
I'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe
you came to "Shut It Down" like Drake and The-Dream

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
or just kiss it, kiss it
Shit, do something~!
Do something~!
Could you please touch it, touch it, touch it
or kiss it, kiss it?
Shit, do something~!
Do something~!

[Pusha T]
Yeah, she claiming that she didn't know
how to kiss it like she standing under mistletoe
My love game got you feeling so official though
I let you referee, just let your whistle blow
I'm never out of bounds, I'm on a higher ground
I'm never empty handed, coming from out of town
The Commes des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin
The J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on
I don't deny it, baby I just buy it
Once I get the mood right, maybe you should try it
Alas, I'm past on my past
I ran like the Flash and I saved the best for last

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Touch it, touch it, touch it
or just kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, do something~!
Uh uh, do something~!

[Pusha T]
See we can take it slow, or we can take it there
I'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair
We both give a little, we just play it fair
You see this back and forth? For me it's kinda rare
Put out cards on the table, let's play "Truth or Dare?"
Let your hair down, I don't have you pegged as a square
Just let loose as you ride in that ruthless
You my new girl, you allowed to give me gooseneck
We don't give a damn, who's watching
Me slowing down, not an option
And the buck hair's waving in the wind
You are such a champ how you take it on the chin

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Just touch it, touch it, touch it, touch it
or kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
Shit, do something~!
Do something~!
Would you please touch it, touch it?
Could you please kiss it, kiss it, kiss it?
Baby, do something~!
I need you to do something~!</pre>
