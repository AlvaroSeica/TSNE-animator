A yo I miss you
Just wanna kiss you
I think of all the petty fights and issues
I didn't mean it, man I was wrong
But that dont mean a thing
Now you're gone
I'm tryna be strong but I'm trippin
Cant believe Some sucka caught me slipping
Nah I wasnt blind paid him no mind
Crept up from behind like that biggie line
I was on the grind, tryna make a dime
He was on her line like the whole time
I can hold mine, been a whole week
Thought that I was strong but in so weak
(p) I thought the was the one, sposed to have my son now I'm just a shell of myself
Guess i jumped the gun, We had so much fun at least I was tellin myself
Now I'm all alone, in the world
A friggin wreck over a girl
Guess I got played like a fool
And even worse I gotta go to school
Face their accusing eyes
Tell confusing lies
Maybe I should hop on her facebook
Maybe start abusing the guy
Report all his pictures as spam
That'll get him into a jam
Send the dude a bunch a malware hope it some how it gets to his ram
Switch up his Mac's ip
So he can't get online properly
im on her page and what do I see?
Nothing, she already blocked me. Damn</pre>
