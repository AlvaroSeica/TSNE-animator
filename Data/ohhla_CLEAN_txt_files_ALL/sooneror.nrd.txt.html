[Verse One]
Sooner or later, it all comes crashing down (crashing down)
Crashing down (crashing down) when everyone's around
I bet you would've paid up, all your cash down (your cash down)
To not make a sound (to make a sound) but everyone knows nowwww

[Verse Two]
(So you're sad) about the moment, you lost your love (DAMN~!)
You couldn't see her leaving (you were gassed)
And that's sucks don't it! Cause God yanked the rug (DAMN~!)
And holding your heart, will not help you breathe

[repeat Verse One]

[Chorus]
It all comes crashing down
(Dowww-owww-owww-owwwn) It's over, leave it!
(Dowww-owww-owww-owwwn) It's over, leave it!
(Dowww-owww-owww-owwwn) It's over, leave it!
(Dowww-owww-owww-owwwn) It's over, leave it!

[Verse Three]
(So you're sad) and you should own it, and you fucked up (DAMN~!)
You thought that you were the team (you were gassed)
And now your opponent, who wears your gloves (DAMN~!)
A nightmare just ate up your dreams

[repeat Verse One]

[Chorus]

[Verse Four]
(So you're sad) could have had so much done, you blew it off (DAMN~!)
Your chance is passing you by (you were gassed)
Time waits for no one, and it cost for a loss (DAMN~!)
A cosmic joke, should you laugh or cry?

[repeat Verse One]

[Chorus]

[repeat 6X]
(Dowww-owww-owww-owwwn) {NOOOOOOO!} It's over, leave it!

[repeat 12X]
(Dowww-owww-owww-owwwn) It's over, leave it!

[repeat 4X]
It's over, leave it!</pre>
