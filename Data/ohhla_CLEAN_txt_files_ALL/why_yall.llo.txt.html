Typed by: Tha Masta

[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Yo, yo, here they come, here they come

[Lounge Lo]
Energy respect energy, no bodily harm
Pardon the kid, I carry sixteen like Auntie Dawn
Hit the block and I boost the bomb
Get gwop and get it all, cuz in time I'ma move my moms
To a place where the Sun shine and guns illegal
Money is right and my kids could have fun with they people
Go to school with they iPod, cellphone, not a problem
You take they iPod, cellphones, you got a problem
And I'll solve 'em, hit up the Princey
And tell Broadway Pif when I get back to the Bentley
That shit got A.A. bored on eighth floor
So here come the cops now, perp on foot
Right to the mic with no lights, and hurt the hook
Staten Island's Most, could tell y'all birds be shook
And I'm talking to y'all rappers who ain't heard me cook
This year is my year, man, and my year's now, so

[Chorus 2X: Lounge Lo]
Why y'all talkin' shit?
And it's me O.B., I bring the pain like M-E-T
Why y'all talkin' shit?
My swagger back, my swagger back, my swagger back

[Lounge Lo]
Now I'm back with the black hammer, back to wacking a bammer
And Donnie told me I should go and smash a banner
Annamette, annamette, my teacher's pet
I hit the streets and I blam the set
Turn down and touch to Booga's spot, my sugar dark
Let's get ready to jelly, I throw my dugga-dart
Catch me in the pitha-park, pitha-pumping that hitha-Hard Rock
Cafe, half a day, you look towards me, I'm blast ya way
And it's the A to the L, dog, you know the rest
V-I-indicated, all haters, hold ya chest
Now why you wanna try me and water my test test?
Didn't mommy tell you that it's lord my yes yes?
And he's a bad boy, he keep the four on the dress dress
It's Simpson pimping right here in the flesh, dog
And I don't give a shit, you know I just a linger
Pop off ya top off, man, I got the thinger
Lingerin' Stone, I been home, been grown
Been 160 and my gun, yeah, been chrome
Been Staten Island, been Park Hill, biz-one

[Chorus 3X]

[Break: Lounge Lo]
Do the yes lord, a do the yes lord
A do the yes lord, a do the yes lord
A do the yes lord, a do the yes lord
A do the yes lord, a do the yes lord
My swagger back, my swagger back

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Staten Island's Most Popular Son
You know what I do, man
My swagger back, my swagger back
You deal me? Yay-yay, Boss City
Beast, what up yo? You feel me, dog?
Staten Island's Most Popular Son motherfuckers
Lounge Mode Lo, suck my dick, holla at ya man
Y'all know what I do, bitch, let's go
Staten Island's Most Popular Son
Park Hill, let's ride
Y'all know the files, man
Y'all know what we do, huh?
Stones, we home, holla at ya man</pre>
