[Murs]       Ready?
[9th Wonder] Uh-huh
[Murs]       Aight
             After tonight
             Don't leave your girl 'round me
             Heartbreaker for life
             Ask my homeboy, 9th
             {*laughing*}
             I've been a bad man who's so damn good

Chorus: Murs (9th Wonder)
Got all your girlfriends thinking that I'm the ("Bad man!")
Never neglected you or disrespected you
I lied to have sex, yet you say I'm the ("Bad man!")
Game is sick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a ("Bad man!")
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
On the phone, with my momma, talkin' bout I'm a ("Bad man!")
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

[Murs]
(Verse 1)
All I wanted was to cut, from the start, I never lied
Now it hurts my heart to have to see you cry
Let you know from the jump
I was that type of guy
Now you all on my voice mail, askin' me why
Never kissed you in public and I never held your hand
I never said, "I loved you," so I never was your man
How can we break up?
Who we never broke down
And committed to each other, we was messin' around
That's how people get hurt
And we both do dirt
Now we could put this all behind us and
Make things work
Or I could get behind you
Cause I like that skirt
Sorry 'bout that
Got a one track mind
But if you say that you don't want me too
Then you lyin'
Tryin' to fight it girl
Come on over here
Who else can turn you up by doin' this in your ear
See why you playin', all that lies that you sayin'

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
She got me screaming in public, in the middle of the mall
I lightly touch her arm, what'd the girl do?
Fall
Now they call security, it's about to be drama
I would never hit a woman
I was raised by my momma
But I kinda feel bad even though I didn't do it
Now I gotta waste time to find a new chick
Someone who understand a man's gotta be a man
I don't wanna have to lie, just to get into your pants
And
Ain't nothin' wrong with a one night stand
But that happens twice a week, plus I'm nice in the sheets
And you look like a freak
It'll be to your benefit
We can get intimate, and still, go and kick it
See, I'm sick of this
Phone tag, text message foreplay
I like to be spontaneous
That's my forte
Let's head to my crib and make it crack in the door way
We'd talk all night if you had things your way

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
She said
This might make me look like a knight in shinin' armor
Great way to escape or get away from the drama
So I got a little momma, first
Had to disarm her
Said she heard about us rappers
I still got to charm her
I'm a tell you what you wanna hear and make it the truth
Haven't been with a woman since I left Cam loose
Two months ago in Canada
Ask my road manager
He'll tell you I'm a good guy, I wouldn't lie to you
Just because you look fly
Look, my bus cards are new
Why don't we shoot to my room
Make the most of twelve hours
We can wash that club smell out your hair in the shower
Turn down the power, lie down and make spoons
Or we can talk all night and listen to iTunes
You assume this the game that I spit to every girl
But I'm careful with my heart and who I let up in my world
So, here's my number
Call me anytime girl

Outro: Murs (9th Wonder)
Just because I'm a musician, she must think I'm a ("Bad man!")
All alone when she listens, and I know what she's wishin'
But she won't pay attention cause she thinks I'm a ("Bad man!")
It's not as bad as you think, cause you had a few drinks
I'll hold you hair out the sink, you still think I'm a ("Bad man!")
I don't do this all the time, you are just that fine
You need to get it out your mind, I am not the ("Bad man!")

[9th Wonder]
"Bad man!"
"Bad man!"
"Bad man!"
"Bad man!"</pre>
