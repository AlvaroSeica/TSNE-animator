[Nicki Minaj]
Hey, you~! Jump in this ride
It's real nice and slippery inside
Rise, eyes, come get this pie
Ruh-ruh-ride it, ride it in style
Said it a minute ago, I did it a minute ago
I drop it I pick it slow, I want it I'm kickin it though
Cause they know that I got that good shit
Said I'm bad, but I could be a good bitch

[Chorus One]
Please my body, rock my body 'fore you make me go
"Na-na-na-na-na, na-na na, na-na-na-me go"
Please my body heal my body 'fore you make me go
"Na-na-na-na-na, na-na na, na-na-na-me go," we gon'

[Chorus Two]
Hey! Stranger over there
I'm really likin the way, you whip it, whip it
Yeah! I want you everyday
You're so right, you're so tight
You got my world spinnin, you got my world spinnin
My head goes round and around
R-round and around and now I'm thinkin
If we could, be, stranger what you say?
I'm really likin that way
you whip it whip it whip it whip it...

[Nicki Minaj]
... Whoa! Is that my cue?
I'm lookin for some brain to boost my IQ
I'm like five-two
My SAT, scores was high too
But I don't mean to brag, I Louis Vuitton bagged them
Hopped out the Jag, proceeded to shag-shag them
Slim, trim, also light skinned
So pe-pe-Peeta, put the pipe in!

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]
