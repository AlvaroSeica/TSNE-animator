Song:   Get Ya Grams Up
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Apocalipps]
Get ya grams up, nigga, get ya grams up
Get ya grams up, nigga, get ya grams up
And if I got the drop on you, put ya hands up
Now put ya hands up, nigga, put ya hands up

[Iron Mic]
Aiyo, I ain't the fucking one, you better ask about me
I buck my gun, and it ain't never brought the ass up out me
These cowards try to copy, I don't know what they was thinking
You bet' to duck when that K spittin', your brain missing, leave you dead and stinking
We slide off in the Lincoln, keep the clips in
Fuck politicking, we ain't got a pot to piss in
I'm a Bastard, I ain't never have a pop to listen
You ain't my man, if you ain't with me, you my opposition
And that's my motto, four-fifth hollows and chicks that swallow
Live for the die, you can be gone tomorrow

[Apocalipps]
Aiyo, attention all my niggas that grind, squeeze your money tight
Everything else could be wrong, make sure your money right
If not, nothing else counts, and you have no accounts
Fuck that, make sure you don't get caught in this bounce
I'm on the paper chase, and this paper is kinda fast
But I'm a, quick sprinter, so I'm right on his ass
I lie for this cash, I cry for this cash, I die for this cash
Shit, I sell Slick Rick my eye for this cash
Click ka-pow, let's go, let the tech blow, somebody call the reverend
Cuz I'm about to just rip 'em and lift 'em, send 'em to heaven
Seven, shots from the mack clip, never closed casket, there they go them Bastardz
Ya'll niggas is faggots and don't make me get my ratchet
Stupid muthafucka, you need to get ya muthafuckin' grams up, nigga

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
