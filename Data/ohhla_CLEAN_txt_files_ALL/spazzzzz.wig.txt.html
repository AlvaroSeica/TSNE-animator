[Shawn Wigs]
I might spaz, leave a half of eggplant on your face
Stand in the court, curse the judge and just ruin my case
I'm relentless, just send me some money during my sentence
I'm max out the Benz, squeeze back on the streets
Get six to eight months, work the rhymes for beats
I'm so juvenile, I still got the hustle mentality
Til my Theodore check clears, with a six figure salary
It's time to cop whips, fuck the technicality
We gon' ride, me and my wiz like Mickey &amp; Malory
Make moves, boogie like we broke the bank
The games militant, I'm going all out, to earn my ranks
Stack chips, like I'm sitting at the poker table
This is a Theodore movement, with the Enterprise label</pre>
