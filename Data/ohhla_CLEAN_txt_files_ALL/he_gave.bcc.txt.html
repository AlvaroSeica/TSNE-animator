[Intro-vocal sample]
"He Gave His Life today"
"He Gave His Life today"

[Verse 1-Tek]
It was a road block, comin' to a full stop
Canine, snipers on the rooftop
Yellow tape, orange cones, blue lights
...border past midnight
Hospital got my old lady screamin'
Red eye, wavy hair, black demon
Tell me, is this what I asked for?
It ain't like a nigga never saw blood before
But, "He Gave His Life today"
Could've sworn I saw the Heavens open
The world wonderin' why I gave up smokin'
They wonderin' why I gave up smokin'
I seen too many premonitions
From the cradle to the grave of our existence
When one leave, one return in the flesh
When that man took his left, my son took his first breath, so

[Hook-Jahdan w/vocal samples]
"He Gave His Life today"
So many youths drop out, livin' the gangsta life, oh
"He Gave His Life today"
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise
"He Gave His Life today"
Whoa, whoa, you got to think about your life seriously
"He Gave His Life today"
Freedom or life, locked up in the penitentiary

[Verse 2-Steele]
Yo, I wrote a song for the soldiers in the trenches
It's a long way from home, stay strong on your mission
Since you're gone, not much been different
Pop proud, mom misses, sent a letter with a picture
I ain't there with ya, but I'm there with ya
Take care, mister, we still here with ya 'cause we care, nigga
Over there similar to over here
Be prepared, nigga, God forbid, these the words I hear, nigga
"He Gave His Life today"
That'll make pop crazy, have mama screamin' "Not my baby"
The good die young, that's what they sayin'
In the hood where I'm from, that's an understatement
Call it The Matrix, where rodents and snakes live
The world of hatred, we go on to make it
We make sure 'fore we leave this game
That Boot Camp Clik name associated with greatness

[Hook-Jahdan w/vocal samples]
"He Gave His Life today"
Yo, so many youths drop out, livin' the gangsta life, oh yeah, uh
"He Gave His Life today"
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise, yeah
"He Gave His Life today"
Think about your life seriously, freedom or life, in the penitentiary
"He Gave His Life today"
Try to live the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 3-Louieville Sluggah]
I should be grateful and thankful for what I have
'Cause some don't even have half of what I have
They say "Henny on some shit"
Won't let near niggas slide 'cause that's how my homie died
They took his kindness for a weakness
And over the weekend, they left my boy sleepin'
That's why I can't play with ya
'Cause if you cross me over shit, I'ma let them things hit ya
"He Gave His Life today"
He was a good dude, good son, good father to his seed
Told 'em "Be all you wanna be"
Word up, I miss my road dog
You know, grindin', shinin', shoppin' and club hoppin'
Whatever the bank was, my boy stopped it
A quick 4,5,6 and then it's in the pocket
My boy was too raw, R.I.P. Rude Dog

[Hook-Jahdan w/vocal samples]
"He Gave His Life today"
Ugh, so many youths drop out, livin' the gangsta life, oh yeah
"He Gave His Life today"
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise
"He Gave His Life today"
Think about your life seriously, freedom or life, in the penitentiary
"He Gave His Life today"
Try to live the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 4-Buckshot]
Look at your boy now, he tryin' to come up
Think he grown 'cause he can curse and roll up
Hold up, I know that ain't a pistol shorty
You barely a teen, what you mean you rip through shorty?
And who said it was corny to be cool
Better then be a savage, or you rather be that fool?
The facts prove that that move is not smooth
I got niggas pushin' flowers like that, who knew
"He Gave His Life today"
Hmm, and if he would've thought smarter
He might've been able to start a
Family, damn a D fall for the same thing
So I keep you dry in the rain
No shame will remain, there's so many things in the game
That'll mess with your brain, so maintain
'Cause, I knew a shorty your age
Thirteen, shot by a thirty-year-old gauge, and...

[Hook-Jahdan w/vocal samples]
"He Gave His Life today"
Huh, so many youths drop out, livin' the gangsta life, oh, oh
"He Gave His Life today"
Uh, Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise, yeah
"He Gave His Life today"
Think about your life seriously, freedom or life, in the penitentiary
"He Gave His Life today"
Locked away for a century, yeah, hey yeah

[Outro-Jahdan]
So many youths drop out, livin' the gangsta life
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise
Think about your life seriously, freedom or life, in the penitentiary
Send him a lord with the red and the blue
And there be a wicked man holdin' down your crew
You don't know what they will or won't do
Now the gun bangin' at you, yeah
"He Gave His Life today"
So many youths drop out, livin' the gangsta life
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise
Think about your life seriously, freedom or life, in the penitentiary
Locked away for a century, yeah, hey yeah, oh yeah</pre>
