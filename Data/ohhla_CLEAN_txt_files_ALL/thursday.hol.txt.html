[Holocaust]
One Indian brave naive would stand, awesome tasting in the woods
He would bury axes with her eyes, the forest could
Like the wolverine shards of darkness is seen of no good
Like they ain't watching the forest of Massachusetts
The hanging monkey, knuckle something shiny, bat hunting extortionist
Nothing could, before the Spaniards brought the horse by the wolf
He would stake out at night, by the anorexic camp fire
An enemy Indian would, he would later charge with a torch and an axe
And as they stood, he was hit and broken by spears, off, out the moon's hood
His torch hit the ground and the underwood, a small Clan at night
Tried to escape and should, because the deadwood's come alive at night, a foot
The night's a loft Indian braves became misunderstood
And with their spanned spears, they encountered upon man, the rise of the wolves
