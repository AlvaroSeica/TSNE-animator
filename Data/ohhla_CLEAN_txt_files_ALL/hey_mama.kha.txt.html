[Chorus]
Hey lil mama

Go on with that frontin' let me know something
Say hey lil mama (oooooh, oooooh)

Hey miss lady don't try to play me
They lame, they hatin
Won't you be my baby
Hey lil mama (oooooh, oooooh)
I said hey lil mama (oooooh, oooooh)

[Verse]
I like your hips, your swag
The way you wear your hair
Your smile, your skin
Girl, You's a perfect ten
Hey lil mama
Why you way ova there, I said
Hey lil mama

Come hang with me

You sittin by yourself
You know you should be with me
Hey lil mama, why you still ova there
I said hey lil mama
Why don't you come ova here

[Chorus]
Hey lil mama

Go on with that frontin' let me know something
Say hey lil mama (oooooh, oooooh)

Hey miss lady don't try to play me
They lame, they hatin
Won't you be my baby

And if you rockin with me girl

[Lil Twist]
(It's young mula baby)
Hey lil mama...
Don't you wanna get to know twist
I got everything did you notice
And if you didn't I'm a show dis
We could jump straight in my Lotus
We could roll around the block
Roll around the shop, baby I'm own my on time
We can roll twice around the love clock
Say tick tock, tick tock
That's the time on my wrist watch
Been starring at ya for a long time
Now I'm on your heels like flip flops
Twizzy f. baby and the f is for my Mr. Futurama
Gettin tired of starring at her
So I walked up to her like say hey lil mama
Can I get yo numba, we could shop in the summa
Cause my numbas got commas, so hey lil mama (ha)
I said hey lil mama... Then Khalil go

[Chorus]
Hey lil mama
What you got poppin'
Go on with that frontin' let me know something
Say hey lil mama (oooooh, oooooh)
I said hey lil mama (I said hey lil mama)
Hey miss lady don't try to play me
They lame, they hatin
Won't you be my baby
Hey lil mama (I said hey lil mama)
I said hey lil mama (I said hey lil mama)</pre>
