[Intro]
Make it nasty, make make make it nasty
Make it nasty, make it nasty

[Chorus]
Make it nasty, make it nasty
Drop-drop it on the bitch, make it nasty
Make it nasty, make it nasty
Pop-pop it on a bitch, make it nasty

[Tyga]
Uhhh, yeah bitch, make it nasty
Tounge down her throat while the other bitch gaggin
Bottles in the basket, pills in the plastic
She gon' do drugs, but we don't do acid
Fuckin on the mattress, hit the best spring
Ain't nothin better, it's the best thing
Got a China bitch, straight from Beijing
Pussy so tight, all she do is scream
Ohh - bend it over, make you touch your toes
I like how she merry go round 'round the pole
Pose, ha, open, close
I like when my bitches don't wear no clothes
It's hot up in this muh'fucker, re-re, reload
Gangstas in this muh'fucker, we got it sewed
T-T-T-Raw when I walk in the do'
Bitches they know, yeah bitches they know ha~!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Tyga]
Uhh - yeah nigga I'm a star
Stacks on black, you could use the black car
Pull-up, hop out, valet the car
'Bout to go big, got bitches galore
Tippin on the {shit} then she drop it to the floor
I like blowjobs, she could be my employ
{Back it up} then I put it in her backdoor
Now it lights out, light-lights out, like Roy
{Roy} Jones, Jr., T-Raw, the ruler
Slicker than a gold patch, gold chain Cuban
Rope 'til it's brusin dick on punte
Gimme gimme chocha, kill it like OJ ha~!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Tap tap tap that ass, make it nasty {*3X*}
Clap clap clap that ass, make it nasty

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
