[Illa Noyz]
For no apparent reason, I jump up and beat ya
Wit the sound tryin to live through your receiver out ya speaker
Sit back, relax, you need to take a breather
Kick it wit my body and soap bake it like Adida
Standard operatin procedure, smoke this reefer
Keep it off the meat racker, coke hinges walls and the meter
No why's either, like a phone heater, known to heat up
Grade A beef, then chop shit like a meat cleaver
The Black Caesar's a gat squeezer, I'm sure to see ya
Word to life, my ministry reach ya just like a preacher
See how I freak the, sleeper, swifter than Jeter
Pull card charge, anywhere like Visa, stay Peter

[Chorus: Rock]
Now we heard about a lot of niggas sleepin, they sleepers
In this rap shit, can't nobody beat us
Peep the, Illa Noyz had it through your speakers
Line your fleet up, No Y-Z, turn the degrees up

[Illa Noyz]
To all non believers, dick in your mouth
Some say they like busy tone when phones off the receiver
Do this shit at my leisure, your future's bleaker
Feel the effects of the sleeper, without ether
Capable to peep ya, impostor in the bleacher
Through telekinetic, he gone like etonic speaker
Genius like Peter, I spit amazin feat-a
Nigga better put me on, like Adam over Eve-a
You be happy like you hit the bolleta for six figgas
Label me as special guest reeker, known to freak ya
Shit hotter than your hottest fever
And you see a, nigga turn more heads than Ike
Turn the head of Tina, make ya seen a
Cause me to get the street sweeper
The dumb deaf I'll blind, cuz I'm my brother's keeper
This man eater, turn MC's to bleaters
Ain't shit sweeter, as we go it just get deeper
Neither you or your crew either, can freak the sleeper
Leave up to No Y-Z, fuck talkin bout beaver

[Chorus: Rock]
Aiyo we got industry up in the fiend lock sleeper
In this rap shit, can't nobody beat us
Peep the, Illa Noyz had it through your speakers
No Y-Z'll eat a ton wack MC's up, what?
I know you punk MC's be sleepin, sleepers
In this rap shit, can't nobody beat us
Peep the, Illa Noyz had it through your speakers
Line your fleet up, No Y-Z, turn the degrees up

[Illa Noyz]
Last word to mamacita, I put niggas in sleeper
Hold the flow be ill, peep the frequent Caesar
Chief the standards of a true MC bro'
You see ya, style, cuz Duck in two thou', no I suggest either
Note to quote son, causin convertors like seizure
Shook one, shakin it close to pussy like urethra
Grim Reaper in the form of the sleeper, release the
New high life filled for the agony of defeater
Without the skeezer mic, I use to mistreat ya
You can't relinquish this pain, wit no stress for neither

(talking)

[Chorus: Rock]
We got this industry up in the fiend lock sleeper
In this rap shit, can't nobody see us
Peep the, Illa Noyz had it through your speakers
No Y-Z'll eat a ton wack MC's up, what?
I know you punk MC's be sleepin, sleepers
In this rap shit, can't nobody see us
Peep the, Illa Noyz had it through your speakers
My nigga Illa, No Y-Z, turn the degrees up</pre>
