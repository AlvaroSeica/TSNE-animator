[Chorus: Kid Rock]
Yeah I'm throwed off (hey!)
It ain't about the money, I'ma blow it all (hey!)
I made my own lane
Let's roooooll, let's roooooll
Yeah I'm goin off (hey!)
Ain't got a whole lot but I'ma show it off (hey!)
Better recognize game
Let's roooooll, let's rooooo-oh-ho-ro-ho-oll

[Yelawolf]
Yeah, now let me welcome you to my small town
Big trucks in the yard, big bucks on the wall, country folks all around
How I was raised, 808 drums quake and they shake that box '88
Yeah, and the dope boys hotter than Hell's gate but I, still in the shade
With a fold-out chair and a 30-pack on the back of that tailgate
A-L-A-B-A-M-A, I'm off, I might pee in a lake
I might go to Talladega and see me a race
And bring me a case, yeah I'm bringin a case
I'm gettin throwed off

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
And I'm all the way throwed off, Z-71 take the bow off
Dipped in mossy oak with a mullet mohawk
Yeah, with a bright orange hat 
and a bat underneath that Chevy seat, yeah buddy might go off
Split you like a bowling ball, spit you in my overalls, ohh
Yeah home of the gumbo, got a couple folks that'll do it to ya for the hundo
And when them elephant feet rumble that Dixie cup's gonna fall off the console
You don't wanna have a convo and not understand that 'Bama slanguage
Like "holler" and "ain't it" but I come to paint it
So you won't get throwed off

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
I'm just a +Kid+ that +Rocks+ - I'm just a boy with a dream 
that bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks
Used to keep a .22 in a shoebox
Now I bang Beretta, she's 22 and I keep her in a tube top
White trash and all, take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off 
like "How the fuck did I get a catalog 
with more hits than a fuckin jackhammer dawg?"
Cause I planned it all, Crimson Tide standin tall
Shit, I'm another lit cannonball
Fuck around and I'm goin off and I'm gettin throwed off

[Chorus]</pre>
