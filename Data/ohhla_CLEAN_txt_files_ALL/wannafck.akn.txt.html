[Akon]
Convict...convict...convict
Convict...music
And you know we up front

[Chrous - Akon]
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know girl

[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]
Money in the air as more fell grad you by your coat tail
Take you to the motel, ho sale, don't tell, won't tell
Baby said I don't talk Dogg but she told on me, oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do
Baby stick to me and I'ma stick on you
If you pick me then I'ma pick on you
D-O-double G and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and your's is right
Rip ridinin' them poles and them doors is tight
And I'ma get me a shot for the end of the night
Cuz pussy is pussy and baby ya pussy for life

[Chorus - Akon]

[Verse 2 - Akon]
Shorty I can see, you ain't lonely
Handful of niggaz and they all got cheese
So you looking at me now what's it gonna be
Just another tease far as I can see
Trying to get you up out this club
If it means spending a couple dubs
Throwing bout thirty stacks in the back make it rain like that cuz I'm far
from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move 'phetamines
Girl I, spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides I got a thing for you

[Chorus - Akon]

[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg]
Mobbin' through club in low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoking section (Just smoking)
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me but I can see you (Baby I see you)
It's cool we jet the mood is set
Ya pussy is wet, you rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Ya body is movin' ya humpin' and jumpin' ya titties is bouncin' (Yeah)
You smilin' and grinin' and lookin' at me

[Akon]
Girl and while your looking at me
I'm ready to hit the Caddy right up on the patio
Move the patty to the Caddy
Baby you got a fatty the type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything and that's kind of scary
Cuz I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncing, got me tipping my glass
Lil' mully don't get caught up too fast but I got a thing for you

[Chorus x2 - Akon]</pre>
