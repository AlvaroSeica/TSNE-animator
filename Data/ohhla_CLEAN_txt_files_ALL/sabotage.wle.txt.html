[Intro: Wale] {w/ Lloyd harmonizing}
Uhh...
I thought it was important to go right into the booth after the arguing
I think it's only right, hoarse and everything
Like fuck it though, what's up {Maybach Music}

[Wale]
Pessimism is all that she know
Cause every brother she go with always pick up and go
I been trying to show you somethin, got a different approach
Told her, "Give me your heart; try to get you the globe"
Have the world baby girl, live it up, you deserve it
Every time she catch feelings she go throw away the gloves
We go together, break up; we go together, break up
Ain't this an insecure bitch, meanin we love to make up
When we good, we good shawty, we don't ever make love
But if I call you out your name, I bet your ready to uh, haha
You say you ready, you ain't ready enough
Cause when it fall right in your lap, you be ready to get up
This is her (this is her), this is it (this is it)
This is sabotage love, counterfeit (counterfeit)
She the shit (she the shit), she the one (she the one)
She got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done
This is her (this is her), this is it (this is it)
This is sabotage love, counterfeit (counterfeit)
She the shit (she the shit), she the one (she the one)
She got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done
Whassup

[Lloyd]
Cause I, am feeling this deep down in my heart
I'm feeling like I never want to be apart
But just when it gets good, she's gone
And I'm left right back at start..

[Wale - over Lloyd]
You got, you gotta at just least teach that one at this point, y'knowhatimsayin'
And I know you heard the phone ring in the back round, but we, y'knowhatimsayin'
This the moment, we gon' live in it
Here we go... here we go

[Chorus: Lloyd]
My girl likes to sabotage, our love yeah
She can only take so much more than her heart got
She can only live for the moment - why? I'll never know it
Guess I'll meet her right back at start

[Wale]
Uhh.. yeah
Let's roll a J and pretend we in love
I've got a paper plane, it's propelling my buzz
I'm trying to make a way, she never call back
She's tryna fall back, cuz she say I'm all that
She only love me when I be ignoring
When I be doing throwin it on her, shorty brushing me off
I swear, I kinda feel like she's slightly bizarre
Sabotage all the time, have me Avatar'd
Blue ball, who fault? Mine, only cause I stick around
She leave before the sun up, leave you something to think about
Yea, and this is something to think about
Why people want you single every time that you got a spouse
Ha, that make it hard to be faithful
Knowing I can go wherever and get 8 more
Ten more depending on where Wale going
Fuck it I got a few more now that my hair long
Its weird shawty, your wares showing me dead wrong
You gon' miss a good thing, end up bitter alone
Shit aint better alone
I get her once I bet you keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more
Uh, keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for.. work

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Uhh, smooth it out, look
This is her (this is her), this is it (this is it)
This is sabotage love, counterfeit (counterfeit)
She the shit (she the shit), she the one (she the one)
She need now, she ain't never needed love
Let her go (let her go), let her leave (let her leave)
This is something that could never ever be (ever be)
Said her hearts (said her hearts), in a cage (in a cage)
Cuz if you never love, you can never hate
Marinate, uh

[Lloyd - repeats "Why do you!" over second part]
Sabotage, sabotage, I love you
Sabotage, sabotage, I love you
Sabotage, I love how you keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more, keep coming back for more

[Wale - over Lloyd]
Work, work, work, work
Work... (Uh)
You still love me? Uh
Keep that box here, haha
Here's my part right here
Hold it, hold it, go

[Chorus] - 2X w/ MANY Lloyd ad-libs

[Wale - over Chorus]
Tell them boys that that ambition'll love me more
If you ain't lovin' hard, you ain't lovin' at all...
Nah.. you ain't lovin' at all
Better get'cho ass up out that sit shawty
You ain't lovin at all
Tell them boys that that ambition'll love me more
If you ain't lovin' hard, you ain't lovin' at all...
Nah.. you ain't lovin' at all...
GODDAMN, drummer; you ain't lovin' at all
Let's go...

[Outro: Wale]
Sabotage
'Nother sabotage, 'nother sabotage; for more
Keep comin' back for more
Keep comin' back for..
This thing is like crack for sure
I keep comin' back for more
Gimme some muthafuckin cough drops nigga
Hahaha...
