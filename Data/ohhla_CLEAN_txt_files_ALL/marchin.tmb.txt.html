[OneRepublic]
For those days we felt like a mistake
Those times when love's what you hate
Somehow.. we keep marching on
For those nights when I couldn't be there
I've made it harder to know that you know
that somehow.. we'll keep movin on

[Chorus 2X: OneRepublic]
There's so many wars, we've, fought
There's so many things, we're, not
But with what we have, I promise you that  
We're marching on, we're marching on, we're marching on

[Timbaland]
So many hills we had to climb
Almost without our strength
but we kept.. slowly marching on
Time heals the wounds we couldn't close
Blood sweat and tears dried up
We're okay... we kept marching on

[Chorus]

[Timbaland]
Get your legs and walk cause we're not too far
A little more to go, but well we marching on
Ah well we marching on, ah well we maching on
Ah well we marching on, ah well we marching
If we lose the sun, we turn the night back
Yep we gonna win, we gotta fight back
We marching on, ah well we marching on
Ah well we marching on, ah well we marching

[AutoTuned]
The bridges are gone, and we're almost home
The end is clo-ose

[Chorus]</pre>
