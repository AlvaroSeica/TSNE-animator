Dedicated to our fallen loved ones, that taught us, our teachers

[Verse 1]
Confidence is the key to unlock potential
Doubters quick to believe it is not essential		
Success is a journey, what's impossible
Can be grasped, The obstacle is the path
Failure is the stepping stone, I merely am just
Flesh and bone, a bearer of the blessed poems	
Prayers to heaven's throne shall be heard
Tailor the precious scrolls, styles preserved	
Tough will through hunger, slave labor
Upbuild, and shun the nay-sayers		
Unafraid to grow slowly, on the way 
To hold trophy, I'm a make it, so quote me	
Hard Struggle, by now my ship should sink
But I solved puzzles and found the missing links	
All leaders strive, as they climb and soar
Warriors rise everytime they fall

[Chorus]
"My mission's to survive, I'm driven 
By the wise word, I'm driven and my vibe surge
My confidence is high, the ominous skies 
Mesh, with my positive mindset"

[Verse 2]
Have the will to win, and desire to succeed
How I feel within, I aspire to achieve 		
A higher degree of thought, you doubters
Just see the faults, my powers exceeds your force	
I'm proud to recieve the torch, leeches
Lost, and scour to reach the source 		
I've come too far, to turn back now
Rumble, brawl, and attack wild			
Past trials granted, cold and harsh
Lashes vile, smash a soul apart		
A broken heart, had to hold back the tears
The road is dark, had to stroll past despair	
I'm hoping the tide will turn, I open 
The eyes and learn, I'm chosen to scribe the word	
My blazing fire will scold your hatred,
I stay inspired and motivated		

[Chorus]

"My mission's to survive, I'm driven 
By the wise word, I'm driven and my vibe surge
My confidence is high, the ominous skies 
Mesh, with my positive mindset"

Let your faith be woven of conviction
What up June?
She's watching over you and he's watching over me
We about to take this over man
Twin Perils forever, aint nothing stopping us</pre>
