[Verse 1]
I keep it super cool, I don't fuck with these niggas
Compare that shit to 99' you see the big difference
These niggas is some bitches, that's just how I feel
You say you cut from a different cloth well bitch I cut from steel
Make a phone call get you tough niggas killed
Niggas hatin on the net when I know where they live
Got a big list of some hungry hood niggas
Send em to yo house while I'm out of town chillin
Cavs took an L and the browns ain't winnin
The whole city biddin, ain't not a soul grinnin
On top of that niggas still gettin shot down
Total anarchy ain't to far fetched now
The city where the sun always hides behind them clouds
Winter time ain't no love in this whole fucking town
Don't drive to fast on St. Clair slow down
Get yo kids in the house it's about to go down

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, roll the window down and get the bustin
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothin (Hey come on this nigga crazy)
Roll the window down and get the bustin
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothin (Ayo come on this nigga crazy)
Rollin the window down and get the bustin
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothing... Jumanji...

[Verse 2]
Well if it goes down, while I'm on this earth very promptly
And everyday I'm watchin out for niggas tryna hunt me
For what I got, bare necessitys, clothes
Food, a home niggas don't got those
Shit is fucked up, I stay with my uzi book back
Fully clips you can't do nothin to me
I grabbed this vest off this dead cop I saw layin on east 9th
All black escalade you know I ain't think twice
Took that me and my crew some niggas that we knew
They survived, either get a gun or you through
Either you lucky or not so lucky, one of the two
If you normally shine then niggas is comin for you
Imagine familar faces demandin yo last shit
Pistol to yo upper lipp and yup he might blast it
Drastic, this shit is book of eligh
God bless the earth, please don't let me die

[Chorus 2]
Tonight when I roll the windows down and get the bustin
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothin (Hey come on this nigga crazy)
Roll the window down and get the bustin
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothin (Hey yo this nigga crazy)
Roll the window down and get the bustin
I don't give a fuck about too much of nothin... Jumanji</pre>
