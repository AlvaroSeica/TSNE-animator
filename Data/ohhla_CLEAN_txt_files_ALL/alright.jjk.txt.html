Don't worry about a thing

Whatever happens whatever may come
whatever may be its cool
I got it covered beloved from A to Z
I'm the overweight lover, heavy
Bum-diddle-lee-dee D
and you can flip on a trip but
it's alright with me
If things were meant to be, to be meant
and what I am here to represent is excellence
if you need any help open your
eyes and its Heavy D that you
will see cause you're alright with me

Seeing that your love's true
Never I'll doubt you
My heart belongs to you
That's alright with me
Worlds could end around me
So in love that I can't see
You and me were meant to be
That's alright with me

Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin
I'll love you till the end
You know it's true my friend
You're alright with me

Catch a fallin' star that shines
Make a wish clap 3 times
Dreams come true it's in the mind
That's alright with me
Your wish is my command
Never thought I'd fall in love again
Again with my best friend
That's alright with me

Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin
I'll love you till the end
You know it's true my friend
You're alright with me

Always and everlasting
This love is just not passing
We're happy as can be
Alright with me
Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin
I'll love you till the end
You know it's true my friend
You're alright with me

(Heavy D)
Now be it thick as a milkshake
Or thin as a cornflake
I love you to death but I ain't
pressed with a heartbreak
And anyway who cares about what
other people talk about
I rather hear it from the horse's mouth
See I believe in, being believed in
No love life for low ties is all paper thin
But watch for the trickery
some people are slippery
They appear making history
disappear like a mystery
It ain't your fault
but you're a walking bank vault
The people of life make life bitter as salt
They say what they want to say
play how they want to play
But you got to live your life day by day
In order to survive you overlook and overcome
selfish attitude or lack of
gratitude from the dumb
It ain't easy being you and
everything you want to be
But whatever you do is alright with me
