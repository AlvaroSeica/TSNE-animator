I think we should call this one, uhh, the FoeFathers
that's tight, huh?
[G] yeah, that's tight
let me explain it to you
you know, the FoeFathers, like
being the first ones to put it down

doing our thing all over, since day one
[G] press play, they ain't scared no more
yeah, the FoeFathers
[G] so you ready to do this shit?
[M] yeah, let's do it Glaze, let's do this

[Ricky D]
uh huh, uh huh, yeah
Foesum putting it down on the west coast
uh huh, worldwide, uh huh
where the gangstaz love to play all day, uh huh
the homies get slipped on in, uh huh
E-White, Kam, damn, uh huh
The Twinz, and the homie Bo-Rocc, uh huh
DJ Glaze, with the main ingredients
and me, that reptable Ricky D from the CPT, uh huh
so M, let's begin

[Mnmsta]
press ya luck on the wrong one to fuck with
get outta line and deny that you get touched with
kicking in the door, taking hostages
whatever's in the way, there ain't no stopping this
man, that's the stone since day one
built a loyalty, proud and a nun
I'm hanging in the cut where the G's at
posted up with homies in the weezat
time to bring the heat so we hold it down
deadly as a sniper with the loaded rounds
ready for whatever when we hit static
Foesum out the westcoast, Dubb let 'em have it

[T-Dubb]
well if it's on, peep the situation
we keep it going so we feel with acticipation
loc'd out, thugged out with my loved ones
old english 800 got me on one
we flip the script to get a grip so ain't no get back
mendatory in this game so we did that
so keep the focus on the locest cuz I'm all in
reminiscing about my niggaz locked up in the pen
cuz it was ludacris and they thought I wouldn't be coming back
hitting switches, bending corners with these hoodrats
so you can miss me if you coming with the small talk
I hit the party straight groupies doing the c-walk
real talk

[Ricky D]
so there you have it
the FoeFathers putting it down from the west to the east
understand we don't want peace
steadily bringing heat from 2002
still coming through
so what you gone do?</pre>
