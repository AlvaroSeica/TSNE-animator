[Intro]
Yeah, I wanna dedicate this to my auntie
Minister, fake homie
Thank you for pavin' the way. This ain't a hostile song
It's a gospel song
For all the kids in the streets, that can't feel the churches
cause they don't keep it real with you
Yeah, I keep the shit real hood for you

[Chorus]
(Church!)
Niggas act like Jesus ain't tough
Gangster shit, he started this stuff
(Preach!)
Duckin' police, hangin' with the thugs
Don't think cause I'm saved I won't fuck you up
(Church!)
Niggas act like God ain't tough
Beef and war He started this stuff
(Preach!)
Barak verse the Canaanites, heads got bust
Goin' to church ain't soft I'll fuck you up
(Teach 'em)

[Verse One]
I came from the church I'll be returned to the church
Man turn me in the dirt, done doin' God's work
I walk the streets anointed Holy Water, I'm blessed
But still keep steel, blow four in your chest
I'll pray for your spirit, then, pray for forgiveness
But the bastard asked for it
God be my witness
He understands what's inside my heart
Same shit's hangin' out your back for actin' smart
He said, "Be humble", bitch, not a punk
You can turn the other cheek, it don't work, pop the trunk
Knock a chunk out a chump if a sucker wanna dump
Lot of cowards never ever fight, niggas scared to thump
I'd rather squab, God gave me healin' hands
Knock the demons out your body, I'm a vessel for God's plan
Why the fuck you think they call me Bishop?
I spit that good book and still get my dick sucked

[Chorus]
(Church!)
Niggas act like Jesus ain't tough
Gangster shit, he started this stuff
(Preach!)
Duckin' police, hangin' with the thugs
Don't think cause I'm saved I won't fuck you up
(Church!)
Niggas act like God ain't tough
Beef and war He started this stuff
(Preach!)
Barak verse the Canaanites, heads got bust
Goin' to church ain't soft I'll fuck you up
(Teach 'em)

[Verse Two]
(Act straight Don Bishop, but hey he don't gang bang)
Ain't gotta bitch, hand guns do the same thang
Point 'em and I squeeze 'em and they all go 'bang bang'
Platinum backpacker, new west do the damn thang
It's about time I get my ride on
Say the hottest five MC's, homie like Dylan
(Bishop, Bishop, Bishop, Bishop, Bishop
I spit hot fire)
You can light a blunt off my verse, fuck a lighter
Real niggas dream
Fake niggas nightmare
Get used to it, I ain't goin' nowhere
Except the top of the charts
Top floor at the Wynn
Sittin' on top of the world with God and Dre, I'ma win
Can't take no credit, God makes me fresh
What did I do to deserve all this is anybody's guess
I'm been patiently waitin' to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Bishop Lamont Show

[Chorus]
(Church!)
Niggas act like Jesus ain't tough
Gangster shit, he started this stuff
(Preach!)
Duckin' police, hangin' with the thugs
Don't think cause I'm saved I won't fuck you up
(Church!)
Niggas act like God ain't tough
Beef and war He started this stuff
(Preach!)
Barak verse the Canaanites, heads got bust
Goin' to church ain't soft I'll fuck you up
(Teach 'em)

[Verse Three]
Kirk Franklin like porn
Nigga so do I
If that's enough to burn in Hell, won't be too many in the sky
I ain't met a nigga yet to come back after he died
And explain exactly how things work on the other side
I don't need no fuckin' wings
I don't need a fuckin' harp
Just give me Yo!MTV and some bitches to fuck
Yeah
I'm a honest man
Tellin' my truth
Not yours, not theirs, not them, my truth
Couple hundred years back I'd be murked for that
My head cut off, quick head like 'whack'
But guess what?
First Amendment bitch
Got freedom of speech so I'ma talk my shit
Problem is, people lyin' to their kids
Tryin' to portray a perfect home but that's not where they live
We all got problems
Ain't shit perfect
Bet you get a better tithe if you keep it real in your service

[Chorus]
(Church!)
Niggas act like Jesus ain't tough
Gangster shit, he started this stuff
(Preach!)
Duckin' police, hangin' with the thugs
Don't think cause I'm saved I won't fuck you up
(Church!)
Niggas act like God ain't tough
Beef and war He started this stuff
(Preach!)
Barak verse the Canaanites, heads got bust
Goin' to church ain't soft I'll fuck you up
(Teach 'em)

[Outro] [Bishop talking]
Nigga. And then pray for you nigga
I put these healing hands on you nigga
knock the demons out your motherfuckin' BODY! 
Nigga. It's the hood Kirk Franklin nigga
Catch the ghost and shit nigga
We gonna keep it rockin' right now remember it's the Pope Mobile</pre>
