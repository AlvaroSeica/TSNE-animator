Chorus: Grimm
Boy, you never should've fucked with us
We the Hillwood hustlers
Niggas known for bustin' slugs
Makin' money, sellin' sluts and drugs

[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
I'm a motherfuckin'
Hillwood cowboy
Falfuria's
Raised, Mr. C. Coy
A.K.A.
El Coyote
Creepin' slow through the monte
Peace to my niggas in the grave and the bote
Ponte cuidado
Bow wow wow
Soy el mojado de ciudad Hustle Town
Blue and white Porche, sixty thousand dollar horse
At my ranch, where my butt naked maids do my chores
My slab (???)
Get weighed on triple beamers
I got a Dirty Harry, plus a pair of purdy Ninas
Raised on the south side of Houston
Fuck with the clique
And shit'll get gruesome
Quick execution
Day of revolution
Moms wanna send me to another institution 
Life is so precious
Why would you test this
Mex out of Tex, with 7 S.K.S's
Partner

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 2: Rasheed]
They call me Rasheed
I smoke the bomb weed
I came up off my feet
Cause I make my block bleed
It must be all
Greed, cause my boys, rob ki's
I'm a chop cheese and forever clock G's
I never pop knees, leave 'em bloody by these
Put them in the back of a stolen Marquis
Call the cops
Please, cause this motherfucker's smell
The ringin' in my ear sound like cow's bells
Well, this is farewell
I park parallel
Walk to the park and smoke
On the carousel
We play hide and seek
And then freeze tag, put the tag
On your toe in a police bag
Blow green grass, still I steal and think fast, fuck a pig
Put a hole in his little pink ass
.45 don't lie nor jive
Takin' hoe's lives
Run up in my face
And take a nose dive, cause

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
Twenty-six pistols, seventeen missiles
Take 'em all to school, and give 'em early dismissal
No referees or whistles 
Just be the craziest
I'm in the studio like Julio Iglesias
I break truce
Blast and chunk deuce
Make a few calls, tell 'em, "Let the dogs loose"
Forty-four troops, camouflage and black boots
The games will begin when the first man shoots
Separate in groups, go as low as you can stoop
Put a hole in they ass like a fuckin' fruit loop
Shoot to kill, make 'em puke and squeal
Catch 'em while they sleepin' in they Coupe DeVille
My crew is real, and after y'all tool this steel
I'm a take y'all niggas on vacation to Brazil
Lucious steal at the ship channel bridge
And remember the rule
No women, no kids

Repeat Chorus Twice</pre>
