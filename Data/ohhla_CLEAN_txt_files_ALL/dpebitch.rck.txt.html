Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I love a Daytona rose gold Rolex, the black face
I got a Fendi fur, some Tom Ford thigh high's and a crocodile Birkin
That's not basic right here
Not basic?
Nah, no basic bitches allowed
Why?
Basic bitches make me nervous. Yes. They make me nervous
You wanna impress? Yeah, I'm gon' show you
If you're a boss, this stack right here falls out of your pocket
you don't even got time to pick it up (You keep walking)
You don't got time. You keep going
It's probably not worth your time
(Your minutes cost more than the stack)
Keep it moving. Keep it fresh
(Keep it fresh. Keep it money, baby. All day.)
It's our money dance
I have my basic bitches pick up my money for me
I pay my basic bitches to pick up my money for me
Alright, that's cool
I tell 'em keep it. Buy something nice
I heard Raven's having a sale. Yes
You know the real boss bitches though?
It's called George condo. Make me a fucking one of a kind
One in one's
One in one's
How much was it?
Priceless, baby
Priceless. So what's a typical shopping day for you? How much?
Typical shopping [?] it's never typical with me
That day you go
It depends on what kind of mood I'm in that day
You're in the mood to shop
I'm in the mood to shop?
Right
Can't put a price on that
She doesn't wanna make you nervous
I don't wanna make you nervous, baby. I don't wanna make you nervous
I don't think you can. I ain't been nervous in a minute, in a while
You sure? You're not nervous right now?
Do I look nervous? I'm relaxed
Yeah?
I'm so relaxed. I'm probably too relaxed
You're relaxed
Yeah
Let's make him a little nervous
How are we gonna make you nervous?
Give him my number
I don't think you can
You sure? My shoes don't make you nervous?
Not at all
Are you sure? My wrists?
That's a nice wrist
How about my earrings? They make you nervous?
Nah
Nah? My weave make you nervous?
You wanna know what basic bitches do?
They wash their hair with shampoo
You know what we wash our hair with?
I wash my hair with fucking champagne, baby
(All day) Champagne. (All day)
I hope it's Belaire RosÃ©
I bathe in Belaire RosÃ©. I have people wash me in Belaire RosÃ©
People fucking throw rose petals at me when I walk by
They throw Belaire RosÃ©
Why they do that?
I'm a fucking boss. Ugh. Was that good? How was that?
Ugh. I can't take [?] Was that great?
But there really is a lot of money on the floor. What is that?</pre>
