Oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Hey (the king) you know that
Radio Killaaaaaaaaaaaa

Oh yeah, oh yeah

[The-Dream]
She mad than a muh'fucker (she mad than a muh'fucker)
And shawty bad than a muh'fucker (shawty bad than a muh'fucker)
It's 2 in the mornin (it's 2 in the mornin)
I been out all night Patrón'in (all night Patrón'in)
She's sayin, "Sorry won't get it (sorry won't get it)
So sorry can't hit it" (so sorry can't hit it)
And she don't wanna hear me, h-hear me
Don't wanna be near me, n-near me
And she's in the right
Cause I got makeup all on my collar
Chanel #5, is all on my shirt
But I ain't even holler
She pressin me out with nothin but her panties on
I'ma spend all night alone
But it's gon' be fine
Cause this works every time

[Chorus: The-Dream]
If you ever make your girlfriend mad
Don't let your good girl go bad
Drop five stacks on the makeup bag
Drop-drop five stacks on the makeup bag (yuh!)
Louie, Prada, Hermes, Fendi
Valentino; hell, they all make plenty
Five stacks on the makeup bag
Drop-drop five stacks on the makeup bag

[The-Dream]
The make up bag {*4X*}
Oh yeah!

She packin all of my shit, puttin it all on the left
(On the left, on the left, on the left, left)
Shawty screamin on me, I think a nigga goin deaf
(Deaf, goin deaf, deaf)
If you could see how she lookin
She cain't stand the sight of meeeeee
I wanna be on her
But she don't wanna be on meeeeee
And she's in the right
Cause I got makeup all on my collar
Chanel #5, is all on my shirt
But I ain't even holler
I'm up all night, she got me sleepin on the sofa
Just when I think that it's over
She said, "You don't wanna break up
then you know what to do to make up"

[Chorus]

[The-Dream]
The make up bag {*8X*}
Oh yeah!

Ain't waitin on Cupid, Cupid
Nigga I do this, do this
Money, power change your mind up in 24 hours
I do this, do this
Do this, do this {*3X*}
Do this

[T.I.]
Hey, I get home late, shawty mad, I ain't did shit
I'm in the club wasted mindin my own business
And they was on me, I can't help the broads want me
Let's make up before we go to sleep, what it's gon' be?
Chanel, YSL, Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Louie V
Pick you two or three, and some Harry Winston jewelry
Maybe you'll see one day that this ain't nuttin to a G
All I do for you, just a part of me doin me
See? I don't buy 'em cause you mad at me
Swear to God I just wanna see your sexy ass happy
So if it put a smile on your face
Hit the mall, pick a bag, black card on the way
Go!

[Chorus]

[Outro: The-Dream]
The make up bag {*8X*}
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-o-o-o-oh yeah!</pre>
