[Isaiah Rashad]
Yo, I left my daddy round '97, he was lazy
Couldn't hit the grind but makin' babies, I'm crazy
Smokin' bouquet, cop it from my niggas pushin' daisies
Like a romance, push a nigga buttons like a program
I been on the JÃ¤ger for a day-ger watch me slow dance
Tough as +Conan+ this the art of barbarian
I got four white girls, all Aryan
I wonder what their daddy think fuck 'em, it's a revolution
Fuck it, fuck 'em, take a break, let 'em fuck each other
I ain't your everyday normal brother, porno lover
She savin' children by the low and guzzle, what is muscle?
And I'm finessin' like I'm Timmy Duncan, win you somethin'
Immaculate, this scatter rappin', no passin' my blunt
Don't you put me on freshman covers, I'm posin' with lunch
Think they worthy of presence presently passin' 'em up
No competing with bleachers joggin' I'm runnin' amuck
Sweet Jesus, I fuck around and need a street sweeper
Leave the bodies on the cul-de-sac, follow me the cult is back
Sippin' on that cognac and that Jim Jones
Watchin' movies like damn that Vince Vaughn is a funny cat
Fred Claus and the Kelly up in your closet
Belly full of smog again, ciggys just make me nauseous
Wonder how the fuck you let a nigga make you cautious
But you jammin' out to fucking Marilyn and Ozzy shit
Ponzi scheme sellin' everybody dreams
Killer like your neighbor, I'm as nice everybody seems
We just breakin' bad and my brother serving Walter White
Hope he ain't caught with that possession like a poltergeist
Momma, where the Priests at? Why we gotta lease that?
Why we can't own that? All these fed loaners
Ain't no forewarnin' came bombin' and I'm just Vietnam
If you gon' be trippin' like a bitch, you should be a mom, see the son
