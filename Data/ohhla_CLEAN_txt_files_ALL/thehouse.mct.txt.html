(Everybody's dancin)
(Good God)
(And we're havin a real good time)

[ VERSE 1: MC Twist ]
MC's step aside, it's my turn
I'm so hot, I'm about to burn
My temperature passed 102
So all you suckers, I will melt you
It's confusion but I'm makin it clear
My intention is to reach your ear
To make the beat move your fear so you dance
(Party people in the house) here's your chance
To put on your shoes, put on your clothes
And just rock till the party grows
To the point where the joint is filled
I'm hard, I don't need a shield
To any suckers that's in my line
And right now I'm ready to unwind
And get loose as the bass thumps
And when I do - the house jumps

[ VERSE 2: MC Twist ]
I always dominate the show
Could anybody else? (Hell no!)
I'm top dog, the hog from San Jo
And I want y'all out there to know
I'm not a fake and now I'm at the top
So remember that I will not stop
Get filthy when you hear this groove
Break it down (down) now move
Your feet and stay on track
Grab a girl, freak her from the back
Don't hold up the wall, don't keep yourself still
(Do you really wanna party?) No need to chill
Pay attention to girls wearin thights
You want them for your lonely nights
Miniskirts and pumps with some big old rumps
And when you see em - the house jumps

[ VERSE 3: MC Twist ]
I need a freak with a pretty smile
So we can do it, love American style
That's the game that I wanna play
And if I do everything I say
Just maybe I want you for my girl
I kick you down with one big pearl
But don't simp sayin I love you
Because the boys from my crew
They won't take it, and we're in effect
At the same time we're gettin respect
Boy Flash gets the party goin
KJ keeps the groove flowin
When I rap to the groove
I say together we'll make you move
So get with it when the music pumps
And when you do - the house jumps

Yeah
Yo Flash, make the tables talk
(Bust this) (this) (beat)</pre>
