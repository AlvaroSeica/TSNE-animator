[Intro]
Fabolous
Guess who? Yeah, Yeah
Brooklyn, what it look like?
F to the A-B
Stay Dougie Baby
Belly, Yeah
You know how we do
Lets get it on, Hop

[Chorus: Belly]
We the freshest, We the Flyest (Yeah)
If I want it I'm gon buy it (Fly niggaz in the building)
I make the room go quiet
cause I am so fresh to death (Holla At me now)

They call me fresh
when you talk like this
when you walk like this (they call it fresh)
when you ride like this
when you fly like this (they call it fresh)
when you can brag like this
got swag like this (they call it fresh)
When you got it, how we got it
you gotta know that you gettin it good (they call it fresh)
 
[Verse 1: Belly]
If you gettin money lets go
we gettin bread, aint nothin like fresh dough
blunts full of the best dro, pause
watch the whole world get slow
then watch my life like hell is this fair?
he got the chick with the ass that need like a thousand chairs
i hear echo if I'm loud n clear, breath in, fresh, thats mountain air
I'm looking for a trophy wife that I can cheat on and keep
something like kobe wife, if her clothes be right, if her hair be done
if her nails be fixed, if her toes be right, then shes fresh, yes
then you can carve in stone
I got these other rappers actin like they father came home
you can say that I'm authoring poems
plus I stay fresh like sean, ask carter or combs (they call it fresh)

[Chorus]
We the freshest, We the Flyest (Yeah Yeah Yeah)
If I want it I'm gon buy it (Belly what it look like baby)
I make the spot go quiet(yea, street fida dida dam)
cause I am so fresh to death 
We the freshest, We the Flyest (Uh Uh)
If I want it I'm gon buy it (Guess Who?)
I make the room go quiet (Capital L Capital 0 Capital S Capital O)
cause I am so fresh to death (Lets Go)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
You would think I came out the bubble wrap
The chicks want em, click on em like the double tap
With women, I've been cool since reeboks with double straps
but no swimmin in the pool without the rubber capped
you might see me on the television networks
wings on the hood from the cars to the sweatshirts
a expert at makin the opposite sex flirt
then I have them bobble head the dick til they neck hurts (haha)
mama couldnt afford to ivy league college me
but I look like I got a degree in flyology
except my apology, truthfully I'm sorry, 
for comin through your block with no roof on the ferrari
now, I'm blowin marijuana by the ounze
the money is on steroids, I'm barry bondin my accounts
nigga please, got my necklace froze
with the same logo I got sketched on my clothes (they call it fresh)

[Chorus]
We the freshest, We the Flyest 
If I want it I'm gon buy it 
I make the spot go quiet
cause I am so fresh to death (they call it fresh)
We the freshest, We the Flyest 
If I want it I'm gon buy it 
I make the room go quiet 
cause I am so fresh to death 

[Verse 3: Belly]
I'm fresh, you processed, unfresh
I'm hot boy, I can make the sun sweat
It goes down like a sunset
When the jet take off, she undressed, yes
fresh, pockets extra swollen, you best get money while the rest is fallin
treat life like texas hold em, my charm so big
can't believe that the necklace hold em
if you bettin on me then double up, put the bakin soda, put me to bubble up
I'm that sharp, I'm a cut above
they get red in the face whenever they show the brother love
we the flyest, if I want I buy it, scars everywhere like pirates
I'm dressed to kill start dying, quiet
you'll never be fresher than I am (they call it fresh)

[Chorus]
We the freshest, We the Flyest 
If I want it I'm gon buy it 
I make the spot go quiet
cause they know I am so fresh to death (they call it fresh)
We the freshest, We the Flyest 
If I want it I'm gon buy it 
I make the room go quiet 
cause I am so fresh to death (They call it fresh)

when you talk like this
when you walk like this (they call it fresh)
when you ride like this
when you fly like this (they call it fresh)
when you can brag like this
got swag like this (they call it fresh)
When you got it, how we got it
you gotta know that you gettin it good (they call it fresh)</pre>
