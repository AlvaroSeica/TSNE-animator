Watch your mouth boy, you might get killed down here

[Scarface]
Heidi-hoe!  Scarface and Don, pullin the strings to your alarm
Bringin terror wit this beretta, I clutch in my palm
I'm scarin motherfuckers straight wit mine
Guerilla tactics, guranteein my enemy die
It's worldwide army alert for all soliders
Either you Ruff Ryde, Ryde Ruff, or roll over
It's a stick up, so down on yo knees, cause I'm sicker
Don't disrepect it, you don't disrespect me nigga
I'm the one these niggaz call on; when negotiations are halted, 
and the time comes for the beatin of the bosses
Make 'em an offer that can't refuse
They don't comply, well now I'm bout to stank these fools
Fool, I guess these niggaz think they can't be moved
Realizie they don't scare niggaz like they thank they do
You fuck wit me, I gots to fuck wit you 
World War 3 motherfucker, I thought you knew

[Swizz Beatz] (Scarface)
State yo' name gangsta (Jadakiss nigga)
Where you representin? (East coast dawg)
You gon' hold it down? (Why wouldn't I?)
Enough said then nigga (Let's go)
(Let's go)

[Jadakiss]
If you fuckin wit the 'Kiss, you ain't gon' breathe
The only time I lick in the air is New Year's Eve
Sonny from "Bronx Tale," you can't leave
Get kissed on yo' cheek then you meant to die
Cause when the gun start poppin then my temperature rise
You know my style; 20 niggaz wit 40 Cals
Nine years ago you was hollerin shorty wild
Now I'm in the rap game twistin these honies out
Never left the crack game still on a money route
I run through the industry looking for enemies
Y'all niggaz sound sick and Jada the remedy
Get shot in yo' eyes and mouth 
Can't see can't talk when you fuckin wit the heart of New York
And that's fouler that swallowin pork
And to fuck wit the feds dog
you know I push the prowler to court
Toast on my lap, got the East Coast on my back, UH

[Swizz Beatz]
How many times must I tell you motherfuckers
We ain't industry niggaz
We in-the-STREETS, niggaz - you motherfuckin right!
Ruff Ryders forever, yeah bitch - now what?

[all together]
Ryde.. or.. Die.. you talk it, we live it (East COAST!)
So Ryde.. or.. Die.. you want it, we give it (West COAST!)
So Ryde.. or.. Die.. you start it, we end it (Dirty SOUTH!)
So Ryde.. or.. Die.. you talk it, we live it (Mid WEST!)
So Ryde.. or.. Die.. you want it, we give it (Ruff RYDERS!)
So Ryde.. or.. Die.. you start it, we end it (Biatch!)
