What up Vents?
Funkoars?
Adfu?
What up Briggs?
Golden Era, check

We were gone so long, spreading our wings, they thought we'd broken up
Thought I only closed my eyes for a second
Next thing I've woken up, they said we thought we'd let you sleep in (why'd you wake me up?)
you looked at peace and, I was like, you should have spoken up
All this time trying to sober up
Swore a crowd, not a Crown would be the next thing I opened up
Saw I was so corrupt, I wasn't coping but
seeing friends going down had me choking up
Plus a drunk nearly killed Debris in a car that crashed
Left us a DJ who had to start from 'scratch'
So I arched my back, stretched my shoulders
Said let's shed this wretched coldness
Drink from the sun and swallow the heat
just to spit it out and have 'em follow the beat
What we gotta give this crowd's something of another class
March till the sun is down and we're walking under stars

"They were recording enough music for two albums, that was premeditated
 They, they weren't just like, let's make a record and we'll pick the best ten or twelve songs
 It was from day one, we're making two albums"</pre>
