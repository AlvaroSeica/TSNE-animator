Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

A woo-hoo, it's goin down out here - that's right
Ninety-eight style
Everything is lookin up lookin bright y'know
It's goin, goin the right way
Seein what I need to be seein, and
feelin what I, what I need to be feelin
It's alright..

[The Grouch]
Everyday I get a little closer, didn't want to boast or brag
No talking bad, strictly fun on this one here
Done nearly instant, bang it out, high off life-style
I bring it out to slang it, musical arrangement
Maybe it's a plate that's to my liking
Striking you it's good to listen to him he's exciting
That's why I'm writing and, why they're biting
Rare sitings of them ? keep me fighting, on moving,
strong losing long nights of sleep to peak
Types of deep thoughts kept far from being talked for cheap
Meet reality face to face, ? be laced with taste
Full taste I am grateful wait
I don't push it around, I let my sounds speak
Pound beats for therapy - dare to be a patient?
Share with me adjacent lines, we facing times
terrible this nation's crimes unbearable find
repairable ways to be paid and stay laid
Should you trade and you spray fool I'm afraid
Displays like a freak show, they tweak though
Fiendin for the sequel
And you know what that equals - better than the last
I'm forever on that task, when a champ come to take
what you wish is your choice you can diss use your voice
I'm like this, regardless I wanna be the smartest
not the hardest, artist on the farthest plane

Chorus: The Grouch (repeat 2X)

You better recognize the name
Grouch and Living Legends here to drop a little game
It's not hard to see, I started with the basics
Built up can't replace it I ace it, any test

[The Grouch]
Any test.. you better recognize the name
It's not hard to see, nope
It's not hard to see..

[PSC]
As the test gets aced, reality is faced
while you searchin for your new beginnin I continue lacin
tracks and wax, all types of dope product
Symbolic of my rise to victory while you fall off
You sellout, ??? ??? ??? ???
Catch me on the beach where the girls leave bikini
tops in they bags and, some titties sag
like my navy blue dickies, fuck drinking Mickey's
Got Solnac, fake Hennesee fuckin with me
I even hit the blunt, what more do you want?
I quit beadies, despise cigarettes but you see me
toleratin til some of my homies get it straight
Come with me, get yourself a dose of this dope Dude
kinda like Devin no regret outloud act rude
it's too true, had to learn my business while I "Boo Boo"
That's where you cats find me, haters be behind me
I flush em, wipe em out the frame it's ridiculous
How many underground crews wanna get with us?
Jealousy enmity enemy, point em out
Read the liner notes but the tape was a joke
Learn the fundamentals over instrumentals
I rip excelling in the art disassembling a punk bitch
Bubble up elsewhere, shaking off my coattails
Busters goin nowhere, goin nowhere

Chorus

[The Grouch]
Any test.. it's not hard
You better recognize the names
You better.. you better</pre>
