Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Uh, bad bitches - I got a thing for them
Yes, bad bitches - I do my thing for them
Like Magic had it back when he played for
Took a bounce, pass it, it's some classic playin force
(A deep) She that one chick I could run with
Type to have Instagram with only one pic
And really on it, be too smart for that dumb shit
I know she wanna go too hard, make me cum quick
Yes, shit by power I call er Angela
Bird is just high in the sun, they call er Pamela
Ain't doing majors, tomorrow I call her Tamara
Put you on the things, a Carrera, I plan to marry ya

[Chorus]
That be my medicine, bad like Evelyn
Tall like Jenifer, her swag is excellent
Shoes Tiana, dress cool - Rihanna
My street prima donnas, which ya's the honor?

[Verse 2]
Bad bitches - I like em hot still (yes!)
Swear like bitches wearing them high still
She melt back, jump on south, that's 5 bills
Never payin no short time, design ills
Fresh broad, make er my stylist
She been around but some cars come with the mileage
Loubrettons are so fly, bought er a pilot
She always said a full belly come with a diet
(Food for thought) Yea, the type to laugh at other skanks
Gon ride with you regardless what your mother thinks
My Jezebel and Isabelle, I love her shake
Like a number 8, we'll bust a check at another bank

[Chorus]
That be my medicine, bad like Evelyn
Tall like Jenifer, her swag is excellent
Shoes Tiana, dress cool - Rihanna
My street prima donnas, which ya's the honor?

[Verse 3]
Bad bitches - don't know who need, look (real shit)
Bad bitches know how to read books
Personality beautiful, love the clean cup
My dream girl, can't even sing, got me hooked
Hah, nice bubble, love how them jeans look
Got my mind blown, my team said I seen woop
She stole my heart like the last stash a fiend took
She keep me sharp, that for fast swag, a clean look
(Vado) Fly as hell, Cynea type
Like to hang with basketball wives, the Drea type
I know she can't wait for the day I make er wife
Black card on the counter, don't even say the price

[Chorus]
That be my medicine, bad like Evelyn
Tall like Jenifer, her swag is excellent
Shoes Tiana, dress cool - Rihanna
My street prima donnas, which ya's the honor?</pre>
