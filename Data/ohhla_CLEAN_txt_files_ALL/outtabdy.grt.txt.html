Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Alright, I'm so beside
Alright, I'm so beside myself
I'm looking at me like I'm someone else
Alright, havin' "Outta Body" experience experiments [?] looking from the outer
Believe beyond the shadow of a doubter
It don't even matter how to fix it
Let the past be the past, mix it
Move it into forward motion like the size of oceans leaving odd life
Look into the air, you ain't believing what you saw. (Alright!)

[Verse 1]
Bubbling buffons chase what none can recruit
Looking for a chance to reset when it's over and through
Shocked in the state of art
Countings of ridiculous flaw [?]
[?]
Bruised and battered by the patterns we a saw afar
Still we emulate pursuers, sure to kill us, we live without harm
Been on the market for a minute
And now divisions [?]
So we're movin' on, going strong like [?]
[?]
The darkness that you're facing, couldn't face it
Words couldn't come quick enough, you couldn't pace it so you're scared as hail
The war conspiracy through [?]
From the heart I had to tell, I blessed it well

[Chorus]
Alright, I'm so beside
Alright, I'm so beside myself
I'm looking at me like I'm someone else
Alright, havin' "Outta Body" experience experiments [?] looking from the outer
Believe beyond the shadow of a doubter
It don't even matter how to fix it
Let the past be the past, mix it
Move it into forward motion like the size of oceans leaving odd life
Look into the air, you ain't believing what you saw.

[Verse 2]
I'm such a twin so beside me, ridin' 'round shotgun
Gazin' at the world around me, arguin' back &amp; forth and driving (Outta Body)
Looking at the path I though I left behind me (Crossroads)
Every choice I'm making every mountain, climbded! (Lord Knows)
"Climbded" ain't a word, it's just a southern thang; sometimes my southern twang had me on some other thangs
Something like my "other" self, that alone and needing help, lead me wrong when I ain't strong; fighting off the "better" me (Yeah)
You know, the one I try to keep off in the driver's seat (Why)
The "other" boy gon' have us makin' mama lose sleep (True)
We look alike, but trust me nothings what you really see (ooh)
I asked the mirror "dude?", but all he did was "stare at me" (Huh?)
'Outta Body Vision'; it's like a pay per view
You pay them prices every time you see them things you do (Close)
I know I hate to do it (please)
Somebody pray me through (Trust)
Sometimes a mustard seed is further than it looks to you (a-a-a-a-a-a-a Alright!)
