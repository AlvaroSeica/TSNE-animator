[Intro]
What is this? {Maybach Music}
I like this Maybach Music! {*laughter*}

[Rick Ross]
If Michael Jackson came alive right now
He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor
{*flicks lighter, inhales*}
You niggaz Spud Webb, comin up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky made off everything I deserved
The square root of a kilo is me nigga... ugh
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfuckin G nigga
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music} {*3X*}

[Gunplay]
It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where yo' seat at?
Where yo' plate? where yo' lobster? where yo' sea bass?
We ain't never left, actin like we back
You should see us now takin pictures, actin like we rap
This the circle that'll merk you, black out, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggaz the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step mo' carefully
If I fall in the field, and ain't no more air for me
Po' some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies "fuck 'em" they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle {*HA HA HA*}
You don't know na'an nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle, fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco, then crank the 'llac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'ma earn 'til the last court adjourned
'Til the last gavel drop, we gon' have it locked
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We gon' have it locked (have it locked)
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We gon' have it locked

[Stalley]
I'm part of the small percentage of niggaz who make it out the ghetto
But niggaz tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me livin comfortably
But when I was broke and sleepin on floors they ain't want nuttin from me
My future's so bright, but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all, but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflectin in this rockin chair
All this space created all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like? Tellin a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raisin voice that tell the people, treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts of fear, no one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear; no one alive, no one to care
Now I got a Power Circle and now I'm on a power trip
And they callin me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit?
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit, but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle, now they wanna be a part of the Power Circle
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
They wanna be a part of the Power Circle
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}

[Chorus 2X: Wale]
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in yo' past
May the kids take all your good
and your wife have class
And you realize your goals
and what's life, without grind?
Those niggaz, yo' niggaz?
Hope them niggaz, real as mine

[Wale]
There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly givin you hatred
There's no applause for ya, and success is hard for ya
There's enemies envy but green my niggaz lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thuggin, they clappin at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertainin
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, ye ain't happy I made it?
I be feeling like brother Malcolm, just added a Nation
Allah got us cause if we holla they'll all snub us
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggaz grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle's small but regardless my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so allusive, saw my niggaz be goin through it
I guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant makes soul music
Cash rule the world, at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, see the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real, my niggaz deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this Power Circle
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We don't deal with weak squares in this Power Circle

[Meek Mill]
Yeah, Meek Milly, this Maybach <strong></strong>
Uhh~! I'm like welcome to the Power Circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggaz that'll probably merk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta tweetin, 'til you hear that chopper speakin
Kill my dog I kill your dog, we tied even I believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggaz to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hook-up
And still make the profit, the streets say I'm the hottest
and a nigga still modest, I'm just bein honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mack in my draws fittin right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, Power Circle a mafia
Just talkin money, talkin money what you talkin bout?
Probably talkin bout us, we the only thing to talk about
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
We the only thing to talk about
{M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Cause we the only thing to talk about

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside the highs of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweakin, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in Y.S.L.
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggaz through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you'll never grind
I know the priors they runnin by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my moms
When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When the day breaks and you earned them stripes and you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
down your fate you record it that night, a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
on a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
No one fake, I'm a realest in strive, of a bilion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky, and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try but I'm finishin my shine
But pussy where it hurt you, life in the Power Circle

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Regardless of how it goes down {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggaz
I tried to warn you niggaz
It's too late now {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga {M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
UGH~! </pre>
