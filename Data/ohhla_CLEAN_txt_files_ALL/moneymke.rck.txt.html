[Intro - EbonyLove]
This for the trill bitches
Fuck a nigga, money make me cum
Boss you better tell 'em

[Verse 1 - Rick Ross]
I needs a real bitch 365
Let her count the cheese let her see the pies
Might say I'm foolish but we have a bond
She make moves on my behalf when I had no bond
All the death threats 'cuz I owe niggas
She told me get rest those are hoe niggas
That's a real bitch she had to show niggas
'Cuz I was blind to the fact she was a hoe, nigga
I'm countin dough, nigga she a double count
Something come up short she'll point it out
Niggas try to holla she'll will point it out
She will catch a flight she will run a route

[Hook - Rick Ross] + (EbonyLove)
We got grands in this bitch, girl come and get you some
(Money make me cum, money, money make me cum
Money make me cum, money, money make me cum
Money make me cum, money, money make me cum)

[Verse 2 - Rick Ross]
She a real bitch so she gotta stunt
She get her weave done at least five times a month
She don't call em purses, bitch call 'em bags
I don't know the names I know they cost some stacks
She deserve this she serves her purpose
She saves her juice box till it look perfect
Fuck the Aston Mar, fuck wit a astronaut
I'm in the gulf streams, nuts in my Acid watch
I needs a real bitch, I needs a real bitch
Ass like Trina and the brains is the business
I needs a real bitch she get ya what ya need
She get ya what ya want she'll even roll ya weed

[Hook - Rick Ross] + (EbonyLove)
We got grands in this bitch, girl come and get you some
(Money make me cum, money, money make me cum
Money make me cum, money, money make me cum
Money make me cum, money, money make me cum)

[Verse 3 - Rick Ross]
I needs a real bitch 365
Let her count the cheese can't believe her eyes
Might say I'm foolish but we have a bond
She make moves on my behalf when I had no bond
Cop the big range let her move in it
The condo round the corner with all the tools in it
Take her two minutes she'll be there and back
So when you see that pretty face you better lay ya flat

[Hook - Rick Ross] + (EbonyLove)
We got grands in this bitch, girl come and get you some
(Money make me cum, money, money make me cum
Money make me cum, money, money make me cum
Money make me cum, money, money make me cum)
We got grands in this bitch, girl come and get you some
(Money make me cum, money, money make me cum
Money make me cum, money, money make me cum
Money make me cum, money, money make me cum)</pre>
