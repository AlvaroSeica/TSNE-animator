[Jurassic 5]
We know something you don't know
And if we don't share then we don't grow
Unabomb will set the whole world on fire!

[Chali 2na]
Yo, we make you, feel the heat
This lyric liquid my gills increase, ill speach
Stills at least 2na builds and reveals the beat
Dollar bills don't make me feel complete
Only the wonders of god can repel and dispell deceit
Burn opponents until they smell defeat
I repeat, turning moment was when they yelled "Retreat!" on the beat
My brain cells have tweaked from insane levels of heat
I'm the fish, with the carnivorous teeth
Finesse &amp; the shark, connecting the dots
We're wrecking the spot, we making the clock
It's extra-hot, perplex the dot
Rock till the detective come and inspect the spot, and if he get hot

[Akil]
I'm loading the hot, and slinging the shot
Whatever ya say, rhythm that be rocking the spot
I secure my surface, for ??purpose?? not
I defeat your whole crew with verses pop
Electrical burnout, we turnout
Fast and furious flames, you'll get the word out
You heard about what we bout from the horses word of mouth
Turning out without a doubt, known for always speaking out
We haul ass and smash at last to surpass, feel the blast!
Till the whole world love it like Outkast
The heat provider, yo heat up the cypher,
Spark up the place with mics and start a fire!

[Chorus]
Yo the Format is down pat rest assured that
It's the Akil, Chali 2na Unabomber track
We always give ya that Steyr warfare rap, 
5,4,3,2,1, time to blow black (x2)

[Chali 2na]
This is the Soul-Jam victory chafer
Your whole camp quick to see anger but behold tramp pick the remainder
That old damn trickery changed the game
Put it in danger, givin it major fame
My task is tryna' excell past
The hell masks that glamour and glitz can sell cats
And through the foul trash absorb the shell blast
Like I was the most bombed hotel in belfast! BOOM!

[Akil]
Uh, my rhythm revel I never fail
Just push it to the limit when I'm serving 'em well
Yo, ???, roll up another L
But can't fuck with this young tough black male
My hands-on experience, no limitless
Top-notch deliverance, soundboy killing shit
Protect the fame and the names of the innocent
Spark the flame hot rain you can't extinguish it

[Chali 2na]
Brothers abandon ship the minute they test 2
I flow like ?? faucets in restrooms
Deeper-than-flesh wounds ?? Neptune
Investigation pending I'll make an arrest soon
But until then, me and Akil gon' play
I cradle rob the mic like Rebecca De Mornay
Impeccable foreplay rapper's do what the song say
If you use gift of tongue-play the wrong way

[Chorus]
Yo the Format is down pat rest assured that
It's the Akil, Chali 2na Unabomber track
We always give ya that Steyr warfare rap, 
5,4,3,2,1, time to blow black (x2)

We know something you don't know, and if we don't share then we don't grow
Unabomb will set the whole world on fire

[Extension]
Man, where is that music comin from?
I don't know, but it's got the whole block vibratin' man!
Wooooeeee!
Akil! Charlie 2na!
Charlie the Tuna fish,
"But what about the other member of the crew?"
Dj Format...Unabomb!

[Further Extension]
I want you to know you're getting better
I don't care what everyone's been saying
You're getting better
They're the ones who have been getting worse
and they don't like what you've been doing, understandably
They wouldn't be saying what they've been saying if they did'nt want
you to stop
They want you to be the way they are, and to stay that way
So, don't get nervous and start asking for help
That's exactly what they want you to do
Make it on your own, the way you've been doing</pre>
