Uh
I be the first to tell you how
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
True artists go it out
What's in they heart they spit it out
I play my part and get about
What God commissioned me to do
And the fact that that's my co's
Got me pissy in this booth
See it's tricky with the truth
Cos everybody got they own take
I'm a give it how I live it
Till my blood, sweat and bones ache
Watch me bake my own cake
Money mixed with purpose
As long as the hooks made it
All these fick official purchase
Whatever Bubba cast out
I pray to him that that's clout
Cos if it's not I'm in the gap
Spittin hot but ass out
And this will be my last bout
In the ring with thie demon
Cos my belly don't stay full
When I sing just for dreaming
And my team's just a clinging
Feemin for my arrival
So everytime I spit
I'm bringin it for survival
Thinkin I might be able
To fold at any minute
So if you got some silver
Throw in some pennies with it

 I'm gonna get what you want
 I'm gonna get what I need
 I'm gonna get what you want
 I'm gonna get what I need

Didn't miss another favour
Bubba's brang it to the shindig
Rollin round peakin
Like my license ain't suspended
Huh, ain't it spended
Perhaps some in to ??
Brought that shit to the hood
And now ya gon' trap some in tohonta
In fact that's how they got ya
With all them party favourites
They infiltrated y'all
With the beast of our behaviour
Let you sell it for a minute
Take some for your enjoyment
The next thing you know
The troops is rallied for deployment
In a war with twenty doggies
They probably won't bark
But they still bit yo ass
Tell Betty to get the cash
? you ? ? mommas
Get you back on dry land
I'm thinkin higher track of powers
As you raise your right hand
Have you ever wondered why
I don't approach you at a venue
Like honey where the beans
Like you know it's on the menu
Yeah I spoke to him too
He came to me the same
Told him naw but I'm looking
Now get away from me you lame

 I'm gonna get what you want
 I'm gonna get what I need
 I'm gonna get what you want
 I'm gonna get what I need

Told several talkazoid
That don't toot but do shoot
Got two cousins in the grange
Hard like ? and loop ?
So push that woop woop
When you want a dirt road
Cos if you tryna shout
They make you whine like ??
And bet, I sure ?
Six blonds with big asses
In a ? of suction cups
Everytime I dick passin
Plus I got battallions
As simple than Nelly beats
So next time you out in Athens
Remember to yell at me
So I can page Duddy Ken
To give clearance for your appearance
Look at this loose sock
The spirit of my deliverance
So when that shit said
That we obviously gives a head
That's why I don't fuck wit y'all
I'm just keepin to my present state

 I'm gonna get what you want
 I'm gonna get what I need
 I'm gonna get what you want
 I'm gonna get what I need</pre>
