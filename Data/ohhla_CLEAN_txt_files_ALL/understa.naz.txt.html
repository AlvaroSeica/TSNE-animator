[Bronze Nazareth]
Picture my crowd, nobody following
Yo I be so high swallowing clouds man
Tell me why you still feel rigs of lightning
Yeah we thought I was still fighting
Vision or inside is when you see in
But no one takes the steps to envision
'Cause missing a centralized mission
Needs the digestation in the abdomen of the Beast
Where there are women passing infection of yeast
You still fail to see through clouds of hashish?
In this neglected masterpiece, we call light
Hell yeah I know its trife
I've wandered through the strive or even pondered taking my own life
But that clears the road through an existence without ice
Let me see, struggling is living, so living is an avenue to focus sights
And doing things in the dark never helps us see the light
So I be seat you; does that crucifix scare you? I'll teach you
People all hammering nails deep into the wrist of Jesus
Even though he's witnessing this directly from my chest
Shit is hard to swallow but there is a time when it must digest
This here - I digress - is at best - destiny manifest
Which means take control of your essence before the hiatus
God bless us

[Kevlaar 7]
Realization of perfection, only in three sections
Try to view through the madness, with no third-eye glasses
Yet the masses have no vision, of the capability of our precision
And our decision, it's an incision that won't heal
Yeah we talk about keeping it real
When you ain't been in a storm and don't feel
Sincerity; it ain't about one individual's prosperity
It's the rarity of one love that got us in shamble
Looking above by our self with no help
Yes sir! Believe me we all need it
What is hunger if you don't feed it?
How do you know good if you ain't seen evil?
How do you know evil if you ain't seen good?
Few have understood; individually
We are all residually being eroded of our dreams of liberation
Every man has it; but not every man grabs it
They should become habit; until we all fundamentally understand it
This is an esoteric statement, understood by few
If not, grab a dictionary, and make you an itinerary
Can't no one make you understand life but you</pre>
