Song:   Bitch I Lied
Typed by: krazy_doggz@hotmail.com

bitch, I'm here to tell you I lied
when I seen that thick-ass it was over
nothin else mattered, I ain't even care
I pulled the rubber off when I stuck it up in there too

bitch, I lied to you, this ain't my home
kicked in the back door and now we're alone
I stole the car that I picked you up in
plus me and your girl have been fuckin

bitch, I lied, everything I said to you
all steps to land in your bed with you
my watch is fake, this ain't my coat
and I sent you letters that my brother wrote for me

bitch, I lied, everytime I left town
I really stayed right here at home
dickin hoes down, every penny that you helped my mom
with went straight to the asian spa, bitch

[Chorus]
hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
look how you turned out to be
you're no prize, no prize
hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
look how you turned out to be
you're no prize, girl, no prize

bitch, I lied, I didn't buy you that
I stole you that, and then I stole it back
it ain't no mr. right without a mr. wrong
first, and you fucked up and met mr. worst

I fucked a hooker and left skeet on your backseat
and kept on and never missed a beat
and bitch, I lied, my name ain't lance
I lied my way in and outta your pants

I never played football for michigan state
I lied to your neden and it bit the bait
I never won a medal for winnin a back stroke race
but bitch, I lied to your face

i'm the motherfucker that stole your momma's purse
and watched you and your daddy blame it on her
I lied everyday of our lives to your ear holes
(you look really good when you wear those)

[Chorus]
hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
look how you turned out to be
you're no prize, no prize
hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
look how you turned out to be
you're no prize, girl, no prize

bitch, I lied, about so much shit
half the shit, I forget
I tell you new lies to cover the old
I throw hot new shit on top of the cold

flip the script up and talk you blind
backwards, re-enactment, rewind
tangle the topic, have you blamin you
for the fucked up shit I do

I told you I owned a mcdonald's in thailand
(and you bought that shit, damn)
I told you that al pacino was my man
(and you bought that shit, damn)
I told you a whole lotta shit cuz I can
(and you bought that shit, damn)
you're no brize, bitch, no prize

[Chorus]
hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
look how you turned out to be
you're no prize, no prize
hey look, I lied and I'm happy for it
look how you turned out to be
you're no prize, girl, no prize</pre>
