I ain't playing with them niggas
Stop playing with me nigga
Don't play with my niggas
Bad chicks playing with them niggas
I ain't playing with them niggas
Stop playing with me nigga
Don't play with my niggas

A couple models on the way (boy)
Tell the waiter hundred bottles all day (boy)
Wrist wear Cartier (boy)
Bitch want dick head gotta pay (boy)
A couple models on the way (boy)
Tell the waiter hundred bottles all day (boy)
Wrist wear Cartier (boy)
Bitch want dick head gotta pay (boy)

I'm in that spaceship jet, they call me L
Got Ls on, she yell
With the L in hell
All I do is move white girl and sell
V-A-D-O that beat may
Jordan NVA never broke the game
We play, candy may
Go white off no DA
On your face and we pay
Your tired looking game
You should keep respect
I'm worse than trick or treat if you bring her here
Yeah, I'm on my shit, I don't even care
Wherever he gonna shit where I move him there
I'm too fly and important
I'm not in your top 5 I'm you sell to
Going for the mob tie like a sell to
All tired all in problem

A couple models on the way (boy)
Tell the waiter hundred bottles all day (boy)
Wrist wear Cartier (boy)
Bitch want dick head gotta pay (boy)
A couple models on the way (boy)
Tell the waiter hundred bottles all day (boy)
Wrist wear Cartier (boy)
Bitch want dick head gotta pay (boy)

I grind through Brooklyn in an all black truck
My side chick is a freak, I borrow her brand new butt
And some brand new breast and some brand new lips
And when she fucking sucking she feel like a brand new bitch
Look me in my eyes when you talking to me
I don't trust niggas that look around when they talking to me
I never woke up in a new Bugatti
But I woke up in a cold sweat from catching a body
Yeah, yes, I'll be on some other shit
You know I'm really on some other shit
You see I'm chilling with my bitch
She talking to me but I'm thinking bout some other chick
Man and when I get up with that other chick I stop thinking
Bout her, start thinking bout some other bitch
Wifey look better, and she cook better
But she don't suck better than that other bitch

A couple models on the way (boy)
Tell the waiter hundred bottles all day (boy)
Wrist wear Cartier (boy)
Bitch want dick head gotta pay (boy)
A couple models on the way (boy)
Tell the waiter hundred bottles all day (boy)
Wrist wear Cartier (boy)
Bitch want dick head gotta pay (boy)

Come through bopping on the block
All he whispering who got? (boy)
Georgia cost while I'm listening the hot (boy)
Boy, old niggas catching heart attacks
Get [?] that ball back I just head back
I'm in here low like the Sunday hats
Shop in the cut waiting till you're done with that

A couple models on the way (boy)
Tell the waiter hundred bottles all day (boy)
Wrist wear Cartier (boy)
Bitch want dick head gotta pay (boy)
A couple models on the way (boy)
Tell the waiter hundred bottles all day (boy)
Wrist wear Cartier (boy)
Bitch want dick head gotta pay (boy)</pre>
