[Chorus: Popa Chief]
I got the swisher sweets, I got the sticky
I got the broads, I got the brews
Now tell me what more could a brother possibly need

[Popa Chief]
Don't be like me, the opposite of a role model
Pass the one with the worm in the bottle
I stay some traffic, refuse to sip idol
Rock seedless and tribal, mushroom, one way from going postal
Popa Chief, bi-costal, love bi women, and I love bi women
I just hate when they don't let me squeeze it
Realer than real, nigga, like a homey action figure
Just when you thought the game couldn't get no bigger
Take two of these and call me in the morning
I bet your party still cracking, I bet your honey still slurping
I bet your blunt still burning, I bet the DJ still spinning
Girl, I bet you look good in nothing, you got me lusting
What can be better than a Burnt Biskut function
Tell you the truth, absolutely nothing

[Chorus 2X]

[Popa Chief]
I made this one for the moshpit, the loud whips
Loud jeeps, loud trucks, cuz nowadays, rap sucks
Labels got greedy, math could change the game up
And that's how I came up
Black entepreneur, to the penthouse from the sewer
Took the dude at the door, for holding the door
My seeds don't wear the cheap shit, no more
And I don't shop for sales, no more
No more hand-me-downs, nobody's leftovers, no more
Now I buy out, the whole store
Ma, pick ya Benz out, diamond studded earnings out
Wave your pinky ring about, yeah

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
