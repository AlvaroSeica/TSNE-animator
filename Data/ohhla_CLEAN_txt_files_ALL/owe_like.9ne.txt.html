[Intro/Interlude]
I don't know if it is gon' jump, you front
Owe me money you might get stomped like a punk
(hey) like a chump (hey) we can thump
(hey) what'chu want (hey) c'mon

[Chorus]
You owe like, Pookie
Everythang thang, coochie
You're soft like, sushi
If you owe like, Pookie
Yes you do - you owe like Pookie
Yes it's true - kiss all that booty
Yes you do - you owe like Pookie
Yes it's true - kiss all that booty

[Tech N9ne]
I'm still drivin, with no license
Cold night when a woman gets wined and dined and it's no pipin
Remember the crackhead on "New Jack City," the low life one
(Yup!) Well his name Pookie (gyah) and you owe like him
At the trailers, thought we began trust
You stand up my hand is on your damn butt you say I'm nuts!
The way I ham up, you said you understand us
And lessons that I can't cut but in the end you jammed up!
I don't take nothin (gyah) but I expected somethin! (Gyah)
Cause you stated after dinner and movie next was humpin (gyah)
And I was always taught by mom and them respect a woma (gyah)
But you owe like Pookie I suggest you pay when the checks are comin

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock]
First tee I go to jail then Wayne too
Notice a traumatic drop in sales when the lame dudes
come to try the same, dude remains in the game fools
wantin to be starts everybody ain't spangled
So how can I be confident and say these rappers ain't be prominent
Today they grabbin put a comical stain on (music, music)
It happens to be looted, you sad, you signin for a little bit of stacks
But when you miss intuitive facts (you ruins it, screws it)
Uck-fay everybody else, I'ma fuck everybody else
I walk up in the sto' what they purchase (NOTHIN~!) All by myself
With all the money lost to booty suckers (you owe a lot of people)
Me, you owe yourself, you even owe my mother
So you owe Pook!

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Kutt Kalhoun]
It's been a minute, I want my stack with interest
And if you come with that you talkin you gon' need a dentist
(Yes!) Money never grow on trees so you disrespectin
Fuck a Smith &amp; Wesson I'ma order you that chopper special
They say you shuckin and jivin from me you duckin and hidin
Let's see you duck and hide from these bullets when I fly 'em
It's been a weak nigga takin my kindness for weakness
'til I cock back and squeeze this and I leave yo' ass bleedin
Period~! Now niggaz wanna act so delirious
When I ask for my paper 'til I do somethin so serious
like bust a head, break a neck, you lettin in some dookie
My advice just pay up, nigga you owe like Pookie

[Chorus]

"You owe"</pre>
