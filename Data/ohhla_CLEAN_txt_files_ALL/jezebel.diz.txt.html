Song:   Jezebel
Typed by: ehhviin@gmail.com

Yo, look, look, look...
They call her Jezebel, you might find her in your neighborhood
Always in some shit, up to no good
Constant boasting, braggin' to her friends
Juiced every boy in the ends
Didn't finish school, she went truant every day
Always on the link, different boy every day
Missed mathematics, she was doing acrobatics
But not gym class, she was gettin' doggy fast

Yo, they call her Jezebel, friends call her sket behind her back
She never knew the plot, she was born off track
Tank top, short skirt, thinks she's too nice
Hates love but she's been deep in twice
Pars with hos, she can't keep her legs closed
Always on the creep, now she's in too deep
Now she faces neglect, abuse and rape
Man said that he'd kill her if she tried to escape

[Chorus]
Whats your name? I've seen you about
I think your choong (Boom ting)
I really hope your not a grim
I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy
Where you from?
Hot stuff (Buff ting)
I really hope your not a grim
I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy
I've seen you about
I think your tromp (Boom ting)
I really hope your not a grim
I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy
Where you from?
Hot stuff (Boom ting)
I really hope your not grim
I really hope your not a Jezebel

You might find her at a house rave
For the fifth time, she's gettin' wind from behind
Had a bit to drink so she's acting kinda slow
She came with Natasha but she's leavin with Joe
Ricky loves Jezzy but Jezzy loves bling
Ricky means well but Ricky ain't got a thing
Joe's got a name and eJzzy loves fame
She wants a man to show so it's all about Joe

They call her Jezebel, on her way to get walked out
Get battery and get kicked out
Jezzy weren't expecting more then four
But what could she say? She just did it anyway
Messed up, caught a kind of STD
Gonorrhea, Herpes, no--VD
Left bitter, left angry, left vexed
But still loved sex, passed it on to the next

[Chorus]

Pretty but ain't got a brain
Got no shame, got juiced on the train
Went from daddy's little girl to daddy's heart attack
House wreck aside, she could never go back
Raised in the church not knowing anything
Then learned about boys and ruined everything

Age sixteen, she was never full grown
She was in a family, now she's got one of her own
Two kids, even worse, two little girls
Two more of her, that's two Jezebels
Two fatherless kids, one single mom
No longer young, but the boys still come
Yo, wishin' she could take it back to the old school
And make better choices, oh, what a fool
But all by her side, she wonder, man
If only she was six years younger, damn</pre>
