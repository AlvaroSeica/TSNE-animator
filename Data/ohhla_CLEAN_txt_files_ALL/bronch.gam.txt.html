[Childish Gambino]
Fiji water and a box of old Raisinets
I got a real taste for dyin but I ain't do it yet
I tried to watch "The Artist" with my girlfriend
But instead I lost the battle with some Nyquil
Playin Double Dribble with my older cousin
Now I'm ballin every day so dude that's gotta stand for somethin
But it doesn't change the subject, man I'm hustlin, sandals cuttin up my ankles
Please and thank you, demons hate you when you angel
Never been to prison but I serve a sentence
Grind-grind when you... {*silence*}
I'm sharin experiments with Seventh Day Adventists
And on the seventh day I'ma show y'all what the event is
Dollar signs, bottom line
Speak the truth and everybody gon' hate you
Unless it's funny, that's how I used to make money
I don't roll with the old, yeah they want somethin from me
Why the flow so dummy? Why do hoes still love me?
I don't know, don't bug me, on Patr√≥n, or bubbly
Or power, old culture, ain't nobody sober
My momma don't drink but she'd kill me over soda
Damn homie, man you famous like Kony
My cousin bang "Camp" man (my cousin bang "Camp" man)
ATLienated myself about a month
Just enough to get, to get my rows in a duck
Just enough to make a faithful man wanna fuck
Girls be tweetin me they pictures, man I gotta look
And most of 'em couldn't handle the panels in my comic's book
This rapper's book, this writer's book
They kinda shook, it's not a hook

They kinda shook
It's not a hook

[Interlude: sample of "Armageddon" by Planet P Project]
There's an edge to the wind
Cutting into my skin
And the air's like an icicle
As the night starts to fall

[Childish Gambino]
No excuses or apologies
Ain't no way in hell they ain't gon' say that I ain't body this
I be killin every nigga breathin, bronchitis'es
Ain't no way in hell they ain't gon' say that I ain't body this
Let 'em know, no excuses or apologies
Ain't no way in hell they ain't gon' say that I ain't body this
I be killin every nigga breathin, bronchitis'es
I be killin every nigga breathin, bronchitis'es
Let 'em know
