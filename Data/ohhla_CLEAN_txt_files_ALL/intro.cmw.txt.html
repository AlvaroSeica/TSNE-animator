[MC Eiht]
Wake your punk ass up
The MC Eiht's back in the motherfucking house
Kicking a straight gangster shit for the 9-1
You know what I'm saying? 
Yeah, and it ain't nothing but a Compton thing y'all

If you was jealous, it's all fault --&gt; Milk Dee
What's up punk?
If you was jealous, it's all fault --&gt; Milk Dee
Pretty soon it's your homie you're grieving
If you was jealous, it's all fault --&gt; Milk Dee
Eiht ain't no punk, so learn it quick
Got beef, what a pity -----&gt; Tha Chill
Eiht ain't no punk, so learn it quick
Got beef, what a pity -----&gt; Tha Chill
If you was jealous, it's all fault --&gt; Milk Dee
