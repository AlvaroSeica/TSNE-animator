Get it get it, uhh, get it get it
Yeah, get it get it, uhh, now get it get it
You got to get it get it, uhh, now get it get it
Get it get it get it, uhh, now get it get it

[Greg Nice]
You got to get it get it, uhh, now get it
C'mon let's get it, get it get it get it get it
Ay ay, uhh
Yo this that hit right here
Greg Nice, Nino Brown, what it do?

Yo yo, I'm 'bout to heat it up, it's the heat miser
Feel the bassline comin from the synthesizer
Don't write shit down, I'm a memorizer
Get my paper up, buy a few shares of Pfizer
Here's a sample, just a little appertizer
Not a supervisor, more like a socializer
.. Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ..
Fuego fuego, uhh, mucho caliente
Track is on fire baby burnin hot, uhh
I used to buy nickel bags from the weed spot
When I'm up on stage I'm like a ro-bot
You're irkin my nerves, I'm 'bout to yell blood clot
For same old shit you still rippin up the spot
(Hey, it's doin down up in the joint, let's go)
(Let's keep it goin now, let's get it, let's go c'mon)
(Alright ay) Yo this that hit right here
Greg Nice, Nino Brown, what it do?

[Chorus]

[Greg Nice]
Ha, ha ha
Check me, baby, uhh

I smoke that oochie kooshy, that killed John Belushi
I met eat the coochie but I don't eat the sushi
I rock my acapulco gold with a little Gucci
I don't smoke stogs so don't ask me for no loosie
Hot damn baby, your booty lookin juicy
I surrender girl, hands up seduce me
Ha ha - yo this that hit right here
Greg Nice, Nino Brown, what it do?
Yo, it's the kush steamer, the internet streamer
I heard she's a screamer, but I ain't got a Beamer
I don't know Louima, but yo she's a creamer
Fuck whassup with FEMA, hey yo I'm a dreamer
Yeah I'm 'bout the paper, man I make it happen
Right there, beatbox, DJ, rappin
(Ohh, let's get it now, it's goin down, c'mon, hey!)
(Stand up y'all, it's goin down right now, Greg N-I)

[Chorus]

[Greg Nice]
You got to get it get it, uhh, now get it
(You gots ta) get it, a get it get it get it get it
(This that shit right here it's goin down baby)

[Chorus]

[Greg Nice]
You got to get it get it, uhh, now get it
(You gots ta) get it, a get it get it get it get it
(Uhh, it's goin down, uhh, goin down)
(Uhh, Greg N-I, uhh, Nino Brown)</pre>
