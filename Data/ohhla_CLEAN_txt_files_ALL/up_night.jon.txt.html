I'm drunk
yeah, wanna get it real? Ya know'msayin?
I'm really trippin' on this let me talk a little shit 
Check it

see I was three in '85 back in Cali with my papi
on some "daddy can you buy me a fat gold chain shit?"
now I swoop through alleys with your bitch up in my Caddy
like "daddy can you bang nuts hang before you play this?"
surely, I drops it hot so y'all can jock it for me
and chumps can play the curious
I'm on some gorgeous Georgie, porchy puddin' pop
pushin' rocks, stop I rock the floor B
and hoes can not ignore me or be slapped for rappin poorly
like, let the force be with you, if you diss Blu it's end of story
so leave your pencils and your pistols out the door please
or be smashed by the Cadillac-a-jack, shit I smashed last night
she told you she on the rag? Nah, she was on her back
tried to hit it from the back, but when I tried to get an inch in
she told me just relax, so homie just relax
I'm on some O.G. Mister Mack, and hoes know me but
only from the oldie pimpin' mags, on the cover with this Mag
like 'this motherfucker's bad', damn right
don't make me jam this mic up in yo' ass
stand right up in this class and aks the teacher who was bad
and tell you LL cuz Michael Jackson was a fag
We be... 

[Chorus]
up all night  (x3) 
check it out, check it out, check it out

now you can call me what you wanna dawg
cuz every single name I love 'em all
from sweetheart to fucking dog, beat off  I'm cummin' raw
's nothing y'all can tell me now that haters wanna help me
and these fake Pac tools got glocks to pop-shell me
but the doctor left a note: don't do it, it's not healthy
plus I've got enough quotes, so what the fuck you finna tell me?
Got the chain over the pale tee, givin' props to JMJ
but I'm like hey: waddup with Scott La Rock shell tee's?
I rock spots till hell freeze, and stop to read my mail
please you disturbin' my peace writing and burnin' the peace pipe
and inhalin' the trees, movin' Sue Allens name
flows that sue-wellin' brains, cuz ain't a crew swell as E's
since the Fat Boys, you frat boys are too swell indeed
stu-the-stutterin' like fake hustlers sellin' weed
tellin' me they sellin coke, I told his folks Oh please
your captain couldn't sell C's on a boat
we OG's, no G's with old genes
hoes thinkin' that I need a bitch
"Ey Blu you callin' me bitch?"
see that's when I leave a bitch
cuz to become a bitch, you either come a bitch
or leave a bitch, but I been OG'in this since Adam called Eve a bitch
and not to be conceided but, by the way, we the shit
buy the tape like the hay and fly away with Adonis
either this is better than sex, or broads even with it
leavin' bitches wetter than sweat, without seedin' in 'em
they see me rippin' have dreams and see me in them
til they see me in the future, that's when I see them later
they see my producer and ask them "have you seen him lately"
and he like "naaah"  then tell 'em that ain't how you treat a lady
we was 

[Chorus]

Yo
niggas be talkin' to me crazy cuz they think they as shady as slim
I said there's many trees around you gettin' shade from a stem
that's like takin' all the trees out, and blazin' the stems
and tell the fools that ya shroomin' when you spacin' off off stems
then again it makes sense because you stepped to me
well too bad yo' ass missed food class cuz Blu has the recipe
I made the track especially for you and you only
but fuck it, tell your homies they can envy me too
because you already mimickin' little shit that we do
so tell your folks go home, I got some grown shit to do
and a bunch of shit to move because the throne's kinda heavy
so if you ain't got a U-Haul, move off my set please
I'll get director's cut direct as fuck
without direct effects I'm directin' you till vets directin' us
so if you wonderin' what's next for us
probably just some blunt with some stress to puff
cuz honestly we stressed enough

[Chorus]
