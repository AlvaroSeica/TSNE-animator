Once in awhile I like to kick it
With those who got a pose a flow so wicked now
Versitile as a child used to follow know I lead
A freaking whole stampede now
True general I command the crowd
With wiles and crazy witty itty little ditties
We've been around since the dawn of underground
Slapped it's butt and heard it's sound now

What you gonna do when me and original
Individuals come out for you
What you gonna say when you don't know
That we been reppin' as pioneers in L.A.
Where you gonna go when we don't share the flow
And you stuck in the road and need a tow now
Where you gonna stay when you not reconginze
the Mikah 9 the one the PJ now

[Chorus]

It's the original
Individual get residual you can sign petitions though but
It's the original
Unconditional all religion to flow they don't know it's a mission yo
It's the original
You need to listen yo wishy washy flow never deal with this condition yo
It's the original
Treat you critical when you pitiful you don't know that it's visual

Pigeon and Mike the religion is to unite
But all of them are wishing to fight
Don't know they missing all wrong
There be songs that we utilize to make us stronger
And the devil we do must conquer
Ride her indeed and excite her
Igniting a bomb from days beyond Mikah Niner
And Pigeon John two dollar llamas
For the price of one drama you don't know we be on some
(Who are you?)

Everybody knows me
I'm O to the G from my bare toes to my head see
Know walk any set without a threat
From East New York to Watts' projects represent freedom
Free from the mundane hum drum rumbling
Underneath the mainstream dum dums
It's the kingdom we come from alumni
We do bring some fruit from the most high

[Chorus]

It's the original
Nothing typical not politcal we will keep it all biblical
It's the original
Man indigenous aboriginal not a criminal
It's the original
???????
It's the original
Not the minimal Mike and Pigeon'll serve you analag to digital

No hold up
who thought that they had this game sowed up
So what you don't want to pull a mac out the truck
pimp strut on your guts
Oh nuts you can through them if you want to
But I swoll him I told him I tell him
a brother is swelling the cerebelum
with a word that I just throwed up
Like my set but no luck

You stuck in a pattern circling Saturn
In a mix gravitational flux
And there's no cuts we ahead of the pups
and pack raps and float free in the particle dust
We just some originaters that's ahead of the bunch
That got there mouths wide open and they're ready for lunch
But there's

No exit no entrance you perplexed
Like infants from my own invention

[Chorus]

It's the original
Not to pigeon hole wanna 9 ball we can do it anytime ya'll
It's the original
Never cinicle do you clinical and the music is the vehicle
It's the original
Unconventional multi-deminsional pleasure principal
bicentinial to millinium five star general

We just some originators that's ahead of the bunch
They got they mouths wide open and they're ready for lunch
