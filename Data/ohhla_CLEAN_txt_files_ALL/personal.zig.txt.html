Song:   Personal Revolution
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I need I need a revolution
My own revolution
My very own revolution
I need, I need a revolution
My own revolution
My personal revolution
Heartbreak is so hard to take
And I lay down in the bed that I make
Crying, crying, tears of change
Fighting, Fighting, everyday
There must be a better way
I need, I need a revolution
My own revolution
My personal revolution
Baby I need, I need
A revolution, my own revolution
My personal revolution
Ay, I don't like the hypocrisy
Is this democracy?
There is no voice for me
In your philosophy
Tainted theology
Oh can you save me (who can save me)
Who can save me?
Revolution
Who gotta power, I do
Who got the say, I do (yeah)
Who got the play, I do
I will find a way
Who gotta power, I do (yeah)
Who got the say, I do (yeah)
Who got the play, I do
I will find a way
Cause heartbreak is so hard to take
And then I lay down in the bed that I make
Crying, crying, tears of change
I'm Fighting, Fighting, everyday
I know there must be a better way
So I need, I need a revolution
My own revolution
My personal revolution
Babe I need, I need a revolution
My own revolution
My personal revolution
Who gotta power, I do
Who got the say, I do
Who got the play, I do
I will find a way
Who gotta power, I do (yeah)
Who got the say, I do (yeah)
Who got the play, I do
I will find a way [x4]
Revolution
My own revolution</pre>
