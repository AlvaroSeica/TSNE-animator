[CHORUS]
Babylon soon to fall, first free ya'self, then free em all
In a Revelation time, stay awake to the signs, break chains &amp; free ya mind
Cuz it really aint a game, governments gon insane, revolution means change 
Garvey Science, Self Reliance, Unifying Souljahs building true alliance

[Ras Ceylon:]
Heads Up, Eyes open fist clenched like Fred says
Ras Ceylon, East Bay Politix with deadprez
Betta b ready for this cool and deadly justice
Rock steady to the riddm want wisdom just listen
The system was created to keep us stagnated
They wanna trap us in a cage, gotta adapt and be creative
That's why we innovate your mental state 
Strategy to make it elevate, down south to golden state
Finding out there's no time to waste
On some laziness you crazy if you think that's gonna make it
So I stay on my grindmode daily livication
Workin not slavin, serving not payin
Observin hella games goin on, I'm not playin
Stayin prepared ever ready cuz anything can happen
Every thought has a reaction know the law of attraction
Mashin with a purpose in my words and actions
Forward ever backwards never aint no time for askin 

Garvey Science, Self Reliance, Unifying Souljahs building true alliance
Cuz this the final call, first free ya'self, then free em all
In a Revelation time, stay awake to the signs, break chains &amp; free ya mind
Cuz it really aint a game, streets is insane, revolution means change 

[Stic.man]
Lil homie its not a game out here
From a G's perspective shit is lame out here
You gotta think for yourself and use your brain out here
Cuz when push comes to shove you on your own out here
Gotta watch your own back carry your own strap
Hold your own weight serve your own sacks
Cuz at the end of the day if falls on you
And if you ain't on top of your business that's on you young blood
Procrastination is the cousin of failure
Something need to be done do it, nobody shouldn't have to tell you
Leaders lead and followers follow, bosses get to ball out
But when you broke you got to beg and borrow
Be ready for them haters, they come in all types of flavors
Soon as the see you tryna stack up your paper
They'd rather see you with you head down feeling hopeless
But we stay ready stay grindin stay focused

Cuz this final call, first free ya'self, then free em all
Garvey Science, Self Reliance, Unifying Souljahs building true alliance
Cuz it really aint a game, streets is insane, revolution means change
It's the revelation time, stay awake to the signs, break chains &amp; free ya mind 

[Sinista Z]
They got me sleepin with my eyes wide open
I be hopin that the devil don't climb down my chimney
Forgive me I've seen too much, the majority out of touch
Such sorcery of course we be steadily on the gri-zind
The swi-zine wanted to see me decorate a cell
Might at well huh, like what the hell huh 
So easy to fail huh, your head impaled huh
This aint no joke smoke constantly
Find it hard to see be ready, keep your meditation steady
Young brotha keep your head up in them books
They crooks, pull the hooks out ya back and everythings on track
Keep it cracked black, it's a chess game, bullet in your chest gang
Everything is everything real thick chain
Wrapped around our necks, respect is everything
Be ready for the change, be ready for the flames
To be extinguished by project english
