Song:   Vaginal Hubris
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo, This song's dedicated to a very confident woman
That's right, this goes out to my sister in law, Jenny

What? What?
She's proud of her pussy, her peach, her bearded clam is well groomed
Thinks that she's the real deal, all other pussies are cartoons
Her vagina is a church and her clit is the steeple
her vulva's one of Barbera Walters' most fascinating people

She's got Vaginal Hubris, Vaginal Hubris
According to her vag all other pussies are useless
Vaginal Hubris, Vaginal Hubris
Her pussy confidence is unbreakable like Bruce Willis

She said you're never gonna leave, I've got the best sausage wallet
Other guys would kill to get inside this cock socket
I said, You may be overconfident you see, cause there's a lot of fresh fish in this vaginal sea
She said, My pussy is a 10 and your dick is a 3
you'll never find any better so you're never gonna leave
I said, Guess what girl? I'm leaving, I want out of this
Cause your way too confident and it's my hypothesis
that you've got Vaginal Hubris, Vaginal Hubris

If her pussy made movies, it'd be Stanley Kubrick
Vaginal Hubris, Vaginal Hubris
She assumes that her Muffhammed Ali never loses
Vaginal Hubris, Vaginal Hubris
If coochies were the News, She'd be Huey Lewis
Put your hands in the air if you ever really get when you take off your underwear
She may be overconfident, but maybe her pussy sings and dances like Fred Astaire

Let's get on the highway, taking the car pool lane</pre>
