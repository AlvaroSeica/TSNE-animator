[Verse 1: Ms Lovely]
It's been a couple of years and we've been throught hell and back
Going through ups and downs but were all each other have
Fussing and fighting my love started dying resulted to violence while the kids were sitting in darkness
It didn't matter
That I gave him my life that I was there by his side being his ride or die
And now I sit and regret trying to be hopeful picking up abusive pieces and continue moving forwarded
Even though betrayel was the end I gave him my blessing and que dios lo perdone
Porque hasta el fin era poco hombre y ahora me pide que no lo abandone
Pero me canso que le valla bien
Voy a salir con mis locas ya vez
Can't keep a homegirl down and I refused to sit here with the tears of a clown

[Chorus: Ms Krazie]
I don't wanna fall apart
But my heart's breaking
Can't you see the things you've done to me
Have hurt me baby and my tears are falling I'm slowly dying from within
My pain is there but no one cares until I let you in
Walking all alone came back to an empty home so I gotta hold my own won't be long until I'm gone
I miss my sanity the ambush you have caused me
Damn you turned me into something I didn't wanna be

[Verse 2: Ms Krazie]
Lagrima de sangre es lo que tu haces que llore mi corazon se esta quebrando cada ves mas rapido
Te quiero tanto que no puedo contener ni una palabra de tu boca sabe como dolerme
Y esto que siento nunca lo he sentido por nadien no me lastimes que mis ojos estan cansado de llorar
No me retires eso que yo tanto quiero y aunque duela yo no puedo dejarte mijo te quiero

[Chorus: Ms Krazie]
I don't wanna fall apart
But my heart's breaking
Can't you see the things you've done to me
Have hurt me baby and my tears are falling I'm slowly dying from within
My pain is there but no one cares until I let you in
Walking all alone came back to an empty home so I gotta hold my own won't be long until I'm gone
I miss my sanity the ambush you have caused me
Damn you turned me into something I didn't wanna be

[Verse 3: Wicked Babydoll]
I won't sit here and lie cause in my life I tend to struggle
It's hard being a wife and a mom I gotta juggle
My life my love
And my family shed so many tears it's brought me to my knees
Can barely dust it off and get back on my feet
I tell myself that I can live my dreams
Lost in the pain and the lies and deceit
Been broken many times but this guilt I shall defeat
Get it all together and stand steady
Keep my head right for my family
It's not easy living this live of mine
Filled with pain heartache and strife
That's what happens when you live that crazy life
I try so hard to put emotions to the side
It's harder everyday but I keep on fighting
This is for the homegirls keep on surviving

[Chorus: Ms Krazie]
I don't wanna fall apart
But my heart's breaking
Can't you see the things you've done to me
Have hurt me baby and my tears are falling I'm slowly dying from within
My pain is there but no one cares until I let you in
Walking all alone came back to an empty home so I gotta hold my own won't be long until I'm gone
I miss my sanity the ambush you have caused me
Damn you turned me into something I didn't wanna be</pre>
