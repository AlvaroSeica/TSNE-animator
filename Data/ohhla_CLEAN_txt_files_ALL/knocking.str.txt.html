Ridin on Benz sippin on a daily basis
Quick to hop out on your block and wreck faces
Standin slanted' open spaces looking good and standin tall, 
Beat Down ya block knockin pictures yo wall

[Yungstar]
Man, I come around your block turnin heads and ridin slow
with a pocket full of money but i gots to get mo
standin grain my body swang as i swoop from lane to lane
to be seen without bang is like a piece without a chain
jock me, knock me, but that kind of stuff don't stop me, 
since i've wanna be a balla got the world wanna watch me, 
don't hate just wait for me to skate down ya street
bald out smoke a sweet with benjamin franklins on my feet
ball fade hit em with shades never afros and braids, 
we stackin can of raid cause all roaches getting sprayed
not cappin just a reala still making playa choices, 
show da gat, show da horses, hear my name in different voices, 
Juiced up and toed down on my flip makin my rounds, 
smellin' like a pound drippin finna paint to tires, 
makin way how I play leanin' hard unless you doze 
Hopped up huggin Lo's, 
with mansion floors and starchy clothes.

[Lil' Flex]
Man, dats da Garden for real flippin' lexus to Seil
Mashin 90 on the feeder
with a dark senorita
and some long haired Italian, 
piece and chain medalion,
my currency increasin, I'm droppin 50 on they gallon, 
i gots to come froze, but they all say I'm cold
flip slap da cross watch my currency unfold, 
I think you ride long seven dayz at the creek,
Flex tatted on my arm, Hieroglyphics maybe Greek
Never brag never boast, fly'n coast to coast
on da Plane sip da drank 
eat'n scrambled eggs and toast
Chingale my padre,bought a Lexus for my madre
We in a bubble lense smoking swishas on the highway
parking on the sand, jumping up outta the van
Bezentine around my neck diamonds glissenin on my hand
watch us spin heads with my cranberry red 
remote controlled vcr stretch burbon with beds
double stretch limosuine
twanky inch bezentine. 
i live my life upon a hustla could it all be a dream,
Exotic beaches and pieces, white tigers on leashes
Me and Shane on the way to the lake, the crush Lexus increases
in this game on a mission
Blainted up expedition, 
you ain't gotta be all in my face
I blind you hoes from a distance, 
chandeliers in my den, 
blowin' smoke in the wind 
you can catch me in a 600 or a big body benz.
