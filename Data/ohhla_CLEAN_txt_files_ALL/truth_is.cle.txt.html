[Chorus]
The truth is that we need
To open up our eyes so that we start to see
All of the lies that we were told and we believed
Because the time has come to face reality
And work together for the sake of liberty
So that our future generation can be free
WE NEED TO WAKE UP
AND SEE THAT
THE TRUTH IS NOT
WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE

[Verse One]
Truth is, the Real reason for war is
Motivated by money and corporate interest
Rwanda didn't have oil, that's why
The world turned a blind eye during its genocide

Truth is, corporations can donate
An unlimited amount of money to a candidate
Democrats and Republicans are bought and paid
So Government does whatever corporations say
Truth is the President doesn't run the country
The people in charge are those who control the money
So The Federal Reserve is really more powerful
Than the U.S. Government and they're running the show
The truth is, That Goldman Sachs
Sold sub-prime mortgages they knew were bad
they also profited by betting they'd all fail
So they'd win either way and no one went to jail
Truth is, the financial crisis ain't solved
It was a big ponzi scheme, an inside job
Where taxpayers bailed out the banks who caused
It in the first place and now, they're still in charge
Truth is, money is created from debt
If all debt was repaid there'd be no money left
But loans that are made have interest attached
That doesn't exist so we can't pay it back
Truth is, our banking system's a trap
That leads to bankruptcy and collapse
It's why the States are fifty trillion in the hole
And this crisis is spreading all around the globe
Truth is, a crash is inevitable
Cuz' our growing debt must be matched in the real world
Through the use of resources, so infinite growth
On a finite planet is impossible

[Chorus]
The truth is that we need
To open up our eyes so that we start to see
All of the lies that we were told and we believed
Because the time has come to face reality
And work together for the sake of liberty
So that our future generation can be free
WE NEED TO WAKE UP
AND SEE THAT
THE TRUTH IS NOT
WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE

[Verse Two]
Truth is, The C.I.A.
Has a history of smuggling drugs into the States
Their profits are then laundered through banks
In order to help them secretly operate
Cuz' the truth is, they've been involved
In things that should make people appalled
Like mind control experiments on soldiers
To alter their behavior with drugs and hypnosis
Truth is, Nazi's were the first to try
Putting fluoride into the nation's water supply
To dumb people down and control what they think
And now it's in almost all the water that we drink
Truth is, there's a chemical company
Called Monsanto controlling the food we eat
By transforming everything genetically
And then forcing everyone to only use their seeds
Truth is, that the medical industry
Is big business with millions of employees
the last thing it wants is a cure for cancer
Cuz' they'd lose trillions if there was ever an answer
Truth is, cures for cancer exist
Just look up Dr. Burzynski in Texas
Who's been curing people with tumors for years
The F.D.A. and the government don't want you to hear
Truth is, you can't trust the TV News
It's pre-filtered to distract and confuse
All the outlets are owned by only five companies
So It's impossible to ever get news objectively
Cuz' the truth is, people need to wake up
And expose how our whole system is corrupt
And if you think I'm wrong, go ahead try to stump me
Lets see you write a song as smart as this to debunk me

[Chorus]
The truth is that we need
To open up our eyes so that we start to see
All of the lies that we were told and we believed
Because the time has come to face reality
And work together for the sake of liberty
So that our future generation can be free
WE NEED TO WAKE UP
AND SEE THAT
THE TRUTH IS NOT
