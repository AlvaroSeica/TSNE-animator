[Intro: MC Eiht]
Right, yeah, we're in the motherfucking house
All for the Money Remix
Shouts going out to all my Compton Gs, you know what I'm saying?
You don't work, you don't eat, yeah!

[Verse One: MC Eiht]
Somebody help me out, I'm living in an age that's crazy
Remember the time, I think it's about nineteen eighty
Niggaz rolling around in Nissan trucks
A bitch wants a baller who can spend big bucks
But I ain't got it, peace, I want to spot it
Baby, put down on lick so I can come up quick
Hanging in the Compton zone
Motherfuckers gots to get their own
But I'm too young, trying to get the neighborhood cluckers sprung
Now the judge just hung me, out to dry, I don't know why
I guess the nigga tried to get his fucking piece of the pie
But uhh.. on that two years stretch
Go see me back on the motherfucking streets;
You don't work, you don't eat
HUH! cause ain't a damn thing funny 
Fools, I guess it's all for the money

[Chorus: MC Eiht]
Yeah, all for the money
Ain't a motherfucking thing funny 

[Verse Two: MC Eiht]
Just call me the Come-up kid, G
Hard times kicking it in the C-P-T
So that means I gotta do what I gotta do
And if you ain't down with the Hype, fuck you!
You're coming up short when we scheme
So when we hit your corner, you're gonna be a goner
Nigga duck, when my nine starts to buck
In it for the snaps, so I'm crazy as fuck
I should be laying low, cause one time is real hot
Need to make a knot, so I rush your spot
And it's like that when I got the Philly
If you don't kill, someone else does the killing
So when you hit the end of the road ain't no turning back
I done signed a hood lifetime contract
Jacking and packing cause ain't shit funny
I guess it's all for the money

[Chorus: MC Eiht]
All for the money

[Verse Three: MC Eiht]
Uh oh, there goes another beep on the beeper
One time sleep on the fucking night creeper
Trying to show stop on the sales
Pull fake braids but I still gets paid
Just say No! - Fuck the TV
Trying to push the shit because the white exect' seen me for the blast
Five-oh fly in fast, mad cause I'm making more cash than their ass
Now, I lay low in the cut
Label me a gangster cause I feel like a nut
Every whoopty got gold license plates
My birds fly out throughout the fucking states
Now my other half is telling me I'd better quit
But I ain't doing this, so I guess this is it
I'll be dead before I go out like a dummy
Yeah, cause it's all for the money

[Outro: MC Eiht]
Right, and that's how it's going down, you know what I'm saying?
Coming from the REAL Compton city Gs
MC Eiht, DJ Slip, my Niggaz on the Run
Little Hawking Bird, to fuck you
I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours
I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours nigga
Yeah, it's all for the money, you know what I'm saying?
Right, HUH! I gots to get mine, so I'ma take yours, fool
So keep your hands on your shit
When Eiht Hype jacks, you know what I'm saying?
Nineteen ninety four, handle this business right</pre>
