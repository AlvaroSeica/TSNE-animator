Have you ever had a broken heart, felt so much pain
Lived in so much dark thought you'd never see the light again
Have you ever yearned from deep within when you see others laughin
That just for one second, you could be them
I lived life hiding behind the curtain
Never known for certain when I'd be free
I lived life as my shadow hopin that the pain would go
But all the time I was hidin from me

If you know what I mean
If you too are searchin to be happy
All you gotta do is dig a little deeper within you

Have you ever fallen out of love
Your feelings just disappeared
But it's yourself you're thinkin of
And so still you kept them near
Have you ever been untrue
Even though you knew right from wrong
But the coward in you just kept them hanging on
I ain't charmin to be no angel
I really never meant to it just weren't meant to be
I knew he thought I was the one
The least that I could of done was made him hear it from me

If you ever been through broken heart
Then really you need to remember how it felt before
You're untrue
And think a little deeper bout what you do</pre>
