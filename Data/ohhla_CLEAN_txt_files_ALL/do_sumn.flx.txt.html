[Verse One: Uncle Murda]
I know B.I.G. lookin down on me (BIGGIE!!!)
If he was here he'll tell Flex he proud of me
Yeah! I make Brooklyn look good homie (HUH!)
And I'm patiently waitin to kill Suge homie (GRRRRRR!!!!)
I ain't even know B.I.G. but I'm mad son (HUH!)
Told French tell Diddy drop the bag son (LET'S GO PUFF!!!)
B.I.G. probably like you heard what that nigga said?
When he come to our city that nigga dead! (HA HA!)
When I come to y'all city y'all be prepared (YEAH!)
They breed the same air as me I'm not scared (NAH!!!)
I'm from where the wake up drinkin Hennessy (DAMN!)
Your best friends will smoke you before your enemies
Huh! And then try to hump your baby mother (WOO!)
I grew up around some ill mu'fuckers (YEAH!)
What don't kill me make me tougher
Seen niggas serve crack to they own mother

[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
Whoever don't like me, do sum'n! (YEAH!)
Perk yourself up, do sum'n! (YEAH!)
Me and my crew dare y'all to do sum'n!
We everywhere y'all ain't 'gon do nothin! (YEAH!)
Pop off and get popped off!!!
Pop off and get popped off!!!
Pop off and get popped off!!!
We 'gon pop like microwave popcorn

[Verse Two: Uncle Murda]
They say the south winnin 'cause they all get along
It done changed now none of them dudes don't along (WORD!)
Gucci beefin with Jeezy, beefin with Yo' Gotti
Beefin with Yung Joc he beefin with e'rybody
Ross beefin with Jeezy Yo' Gotti ain't feelin Plies
Jeezy and Bleu fell out just tell me who got them pies (WHO GOT IT?!)
They tried to smoke Rick Ross in his whip (WOO!)
Was it the GD's or Jeezy and the Crips? (WOO)
If this ain't the hardest record on Flex tape?! (WHAT!)
Then Ray J and Kim ain't make a sex tape (HA HA!)
I say what you won't hear from nobody else (NAH!)
Flex who they mad at me or they self? (AHHHHH!!!)
This is not what they expected
They thought they was gonna hear a strip club record (THIS AIN'T THAT!)
Instead I got niggas actin reckless
In the strip club strippin niggas for they necklace (RAH!!!)

[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
Whoever don't like me, do sum'n! (YEAH!)
Perk yourself up, do sum'n! (YEAH!)
Me and my crew dare y'all to do sum'n!
We everywhere y'all ain't 'gon do nothin! (YEAH!)
Pop off and get popped off!!!
Pop off and get popped off!!!
Pop off and get popped off!!!
We 'gon pop like microwave popcorn

[Bridge: Uncle Murda]
Real recognize real (YEAH!) I don't get along with the fake (NAH!)
Oh I must be doin sum'n right (YEAH!) 'Cause I'm the one e'rybody hate (HA!!!)
Bite my tongue for no one (NAH!) I be sayin what the fuck I want (YEAH! YEAH!)
Oh I'm ready for the problems (YEAH!) We can do it however you want!

[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
Whoever don't like me, do sum'n! (YEAH!)
Perk yourself up, do sum'n! (YEAH!)
Me and my crew dare y'all to do sum'n!
We everywhere y'all ain't 'gon do nothin! (YEAH!)
Pop off and get popped off!!!
Pop off and get popped off!!!
Pop off and get popped off!!!
We 'gon pop like microwave popcorn
