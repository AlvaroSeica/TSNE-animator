[Chorus]
I can't play the sideline
with all my folk in the stands
Giving up just ain't a part of the plan
I can't play the sideline
while they still cheer
Yeah I've been down, but I'm still here
I can't play the sideline
Yeah I can deal with the pain
cause you ain't winning 'less they hollering your name
I can't play the sideline
So put me in coach
I swear to God, that's all I got to live for

[Big K.R.I.T.]
On my first rep tryna max out
Lifting burdens, being worried till I pass out
Jumping hurdles, running laps just for scraps in this rat race
Lord knows I'm tired, never stop, gotta keep pace
Read my playbook, lay my head down
Caught a sprain, ice buckets by my bed now
Felt an impact like a truck hit me full contact
No pads, Lord come get me, I'm down
I can feel it in my soul
This my last chance to shine, but they know I'm getting old
Hard to move on, my legs ain't been the same
since I took a fall from greatness, now I'm knowing when it rains
On my homecoming, see my folks smiling, coach by the do'
I'm the GOAT, but I really need to hold something
One more dime, I'll be fine
Yeah I'm the best in my prime, but what about now?

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
On the second set, got to do this for myself
When the ball's in my court can't depend on no one else
This a long shot, but I trained all my life
Broke some bone, cried some tears just so I could get it right
When it's time, hit the gym tryna win
On the off-season doing what I can, but I'm running out of time
Got a partner going through it
cause his bills still due and he ain't started since the moment that he signed
Physical training and all
Rehabilitation the cause of shuck and jiving on hard turf
Ain't no complaining at all when they overturning your call
This is life, and yes it's hard work
We out here fighting like dogs in every man backyard
Tryna get what was lost reimbursed
Just to be ghost on the wall
Give it my all till they hang up my shirt

[Chorus]</pre>
