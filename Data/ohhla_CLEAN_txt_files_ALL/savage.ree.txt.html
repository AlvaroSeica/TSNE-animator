Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Young living savage
For that bread I gotta have it
The top I gotta have it
Young living savage
300, we so savage
GBE, we so savage
OTF, we so savage
Young living savage

[Verse 1]
I smoke kush, I'm an addict
Young living savage
My niggaz know we got it
My bitches be attractive
Riding with that ratchet
Hundred for that cabbage
My young niggaz clap
Number 5, bitch they clap
Don't try me, it'll happen
I'm toting you know I got it
Young living savage
I'm toting you know I got it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I be toking 30's
Me and my niggaz thirsty
We out here, bitch we lurking
Cash up bitch, we splurging
I'm balling Julius Erving Fast lane, I'm swerving
Fucked up and I know it
Your bitch knows she's going
I'm reckless and you know it
If I got it, I'm gonna blow it
Bands on bands, I blow it
I'm flexing, got her going

[Chorus]</pre>
