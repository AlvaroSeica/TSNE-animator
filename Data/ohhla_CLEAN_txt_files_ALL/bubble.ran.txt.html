Yo... yo we make it bubble man, I don't want no trouble man
I'm just here to flow and make it rock like a Knicks fan
Heard you sold a couple grand? Dawg I'm still strugglin
Guess I got a couple fans, got a lot of love for them
So I gotta make it dope for them, brothers just don't understand
That's the life of brother Ran, microphone in one hand
My cock's on the other hand, tellin me to love him man
But the fans wanna jam, hooked up some Mega Man
But we ain't a cover band, 80's babies understand
It's part of the culture fam, I ain't gon' insult ya man
Bad mamma jam in Cazal shades - I love it man
Like we made a covenant, but don't tell the government
Capcom pseudo-ROM probably couldn't cover it
Free 99 - hope the whole world discover it
You ain't sellin it? Nah it's for the hell of it
Let the world know, Mega Ran's still relevant
WHAT?~!

My place in history's solidified
I'm like the first stone settin off genocide
And rappers won't come to my face
Cause I'm downright chillin like starin in a killer's eyes
Really I'm, the type to get at you
In a battle you a cat who switch sides like Storm Shadow
We gon' catch you, here go a free tip
From the best kept secret you'll never see slip
Like a LSD trip, when I rock frequent
Top secret, unorthodox sequence
With this mic piece, I slice beats
You might know cats that rap but trust, they ain't like me
Pride of Oak Lane's alive as propane
My lines is cocaine the guy's a pro mayne
Hate touchers, spittin about rubbish
Who don't love it, man you trippin without luggage
Name a rapper that can get with me
So I can send him a Random CD so he can disagree
Give him the call, I gave you my all
Play your position, big Ran stayed on the ball, yeah

Can we make it bubb...
Yo what happened to the beat man
Shh, I'm sick of this man I quit
I'm gone...
