[Intro: ???]
Yo, It's that new Bandz, Yeah, Time to tell these niggas man
They think it's a fuckin game, Yeah

[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
Your brain on the top was short like leprechaun's
Yall one hit wonders is going-going-gone
If Bandz pop up at the Grammy's shit is on, (It's on)
If Bandz pop up in the hood shit is on, (Shit is on)
Yall know I don't play that shit, (Play that shit)
I got drama, I'ma spray that shit, (Spray that shit)
Yall better move, Get out the way bitch
Cause bullets got no name and you could get hit

[Hook: Rubbabandz]
Niggas tried to kill me once I'm still here
Niggas tried to kill me once I'm still here
Niggas tried to kill me once I'm still here
Niggas tried to kill me once I'm still here
Shot me in the head with the forty cal, Ohh
Shot me in the head with the forty cal, Ohh
Shot me in the head with the forty cal
Who the fuck gone stop me now-now-now

[Rubbabandz]
I'm still breathin, I'm here for a reason
Bandz got too much flava, Too much season
Eyes blood shot red, Look at the black demon
Money on my mind and I'm microphone feindin
To rock a stadium and get that tour money
Go triple platinum, I Love record sale money
With Hugh Hefner, And some Playboy bunny
Fuck Hugh Hefner, Fuck a Playboy bunny
I need a black tail with a fat tail
A ghetto ass girl in a Honda X-L
And if she act up, I choke her ass out
Like Latrell Sprewell, Ding, Saved by the bell

[Chorus]

[Rubbabandz]
Yall A&amp;R's must be ludicrous, (Ludicrous)
A record label don't know what to do with this, (Do with this)
Yall could jump back on my dick
When I blow the fuck up with this GMI shit
You heard of me before, I've been here before
Been doin this here for fifteen years strong
A young vet in the game, I got it goin on
Yall little rap niggas put your hard hats on
Yeah, Yeah, I got my niggas wit me
GMI paper route, Slow motion run the city
A circle full of snitches, What yall talkin about
I could dig a ditch for ya niggas runnin your mouth
Run up in your house gun in your mouth, Who said that
Ho niggas always sayin shit behind your back
I here to set the record straight
I'll split your wig to the white meat, You'll need a titanium plate
I'm not the snitch, I'm the snitchy
I don't tell on niggas, Niggas tell on me
My name aint even in the streets, Unless
I'm fuckin somebody bitch or poppin off my heat

[Chorus]</pre>
