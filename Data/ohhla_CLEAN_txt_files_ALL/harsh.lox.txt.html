[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
You know!!!! 
One day I got a call from the Ghost who told me I had to get on this conference call
To discuss a little business with him and the homey Rozay
Know the situation transpired where a nigga had to get dealt with a little harshly
Yeah!

[Verse One: Styles P]
Root for the villian and shoot with no feelin
Like Audio Two yeah the crew is "Top Billin"
Blowin the dutch in the coupe with no ceilin
Invisible bully like the Gooch when I'm illin
Cash too green, it's taped to the toilet
Like I'm Michael Corleone in the bathroom scene
Young black Vito, chopped and wrapped kilos
Clap torpedos, stack, Doritos
We in the Mexico sippin the Mojito
Discussin perico, green weed and diesel
AK, nozzle air holes you can see through
Ridin the bulletproof five, yeah, I'm lethal

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! When niggas hear this shit they say it's (HARSH!!!)
Type of shit that make you wanna handle a nigga (HARSH!!!)
Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (HARSH!!!)
And like a Rothchild with money I'm kinda (HARSH!!!)
HOW WE DEALIN WITH 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!) HOW WE DEALIN WITH 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!)
HOW WE HANDLIN 'EM!!!  (HARSH!!!) HOW WE MANDLIN 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!)
STOP BITCHIN YOU THE ONE WHO DONE 'CAUSE ME TO ACT!!!  (HARSH!!!)
AND IF I'M ITCHIN AND YOU FRONT IT'S MY DUTY TO ACT!!!

[Verse Two: Rick Ross]
Style is infectious, actress in a Lexus
Sunroof open had cheese for breakfast
Beef never settled I'm Lyor to the ghetto (HUH!)
Russell with the hustle Rick Rubin with the metal
When I lick a shot I'm aimin at ya top floor (WOOO!!!!)
Blocks like stock everybody bought more (HUH!)
Birds fell out the sky, rats could drop dead
Flyin through Bed-Stuy, white drop head
Sticky green twist, guillotine click (HUH!) 
Dapper Dan three piece suit for the trip
Link with Dominicanos, straight pesos fritos
Three point range hit free throws with kilos

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! When niggas hear this shit they say it's (HARSH!!!)
Type of shit that make you wanna handle a nigga (HARSH!!!)
Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (HARSH!!!)
And like a Rothchild with money I'm kinda (HARSH!!!)
HOW WE DEALIN WITH 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!) HOW WE DEALIN WITH 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!)
HOW WE HANDLIN 'EM!!!  (HARSH!!!) HOW WE MANDLIN 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!)
STOP BITCHIN YOU THE ONE WHO DONE 'CAUSE ME TO ACT!!!  (HARSH!!!)
AND IF I'M ITCHIN AND YOU FRONT IT'S MY DUTY TO ACT!!!

[Verse Three: Styles P]
Shine like brightenin sure but I'm the titan
Hard like when Customato was trainin Tyson
Gun we react in the car but no license
Life on top of the city could touch lightenin
Cocaine wave, dollar bill slave
Rangler is tough but the inside is suede
Ride with Louch and 'Kiss until I see a grave
One third of a legacy
Pedigree is I can make a don a don 'cause of integrity
Rap like a phenomenom sleep for a better dream
Nine is for better things smoke for medicine
BIG is the only rapper I don't think that I'm better than

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! When niggas hear this shit they say it's (HARSH!!!)
Type of shit that make you wanna handle a nigga (HARSH!!!)
Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (HARSH!!!)
And like a Rothchild with money I'm kinda (HARSH!!!)
HOW WE DEALIN WITH 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!) HOW WE DEALIN WITH 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!)
HOW WE HANDLIN 'EM!!!  (HARSH!!!) HOW WE MANDLIN 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!)
STOP BITCHIN YOU THE ONE WHO DONE 'CAUSE ME TO ACT!!!  (HARSH!!!)
AND IF I'M ITCHIN AND YOU FRONT IT'S MY DUTY TO ACT!!!

[Verse Four: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! I rub stones together and cast a spell quick Like 
Like a Zoe hittin voodoo blessings 'fore I move bricks
I beat you like the number eleven with two sticks
Money from the door and then when I bop with two chicks (COME ON!!!)
It won't stop never stop there he go again (HUH!)
Together watch the coke and have the bakin soda sort of blend (HA!)
Fredricka kinda pure see how we make the fiends flock
And watch the lines for the coke a quickly wrap around the block 
They say we bad for business 'cause the coke price dropped
How we flooded and we bubble white 'til it's white hot (WHAT!)
Pot purchases we chop it up to pieces
'Til only the shake is left countin the profit and a bezel (WOOO!!!!)
Eight million dollar yacht, scotch, a little refer
Diamonds so big they call it obnoxious little creature (OH!)
Money to cop original paintings of Mona Lisa
High the way I feel a cloud sittin on my caesar

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! When niggas hear this shit they say it's (HARSH!!!)
Type of shit that make you wanna handle a nigga (HARSH!!!)
Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (HARSH!!!)
And like a Rothchild with money I'm kinda (HARSH!!!)
HOW WE DEALIN WITH 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!) HOW WE DEALIN WITH 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!)
HOW WE HANDLIN 'EM!!!  (HARSH!!!) HOW WE MANDLIN 'EM!!! (HARSH!!!)
STOP BITCHIN YOU THE ONE WHO DONE 'CAUSE ME TO ACT!!!  (HARSH!!!)
AND IF I'M ITCHIN AND YOU FRONT IT'S MY DUTY TO ACT!!!</pre>
