[Timbaland]
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me
East coast feel me
West coast feel me
 (repeat x 2)

[Aaliyah - Verse 1 (Playa sings the parentheses)]
Boy, I've been watching you like a hawk in the sky
that flies, and you were my prey (my prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin heads 
I know that one of these days (days)
We gon hook it up while we talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holding back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell it but

Chorus One: Aaliyah

If I, if I let you know
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my back, cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go?  Is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody, right now naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody, tell me are you that somebody?

[Aaliyah]
Boy, won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block, while everyone's sleep (sleeps, sleeps)
I'll be waiting there with my trucks, my locs, my hat 
Just so I'm low key
If you tell the world
(Don't speak, you know that would be weak)
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let you but if I

Chorus Two: Aaliyah

If I, if I let this go
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my back, cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go?  Is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody, right now naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody, tell me are you that somebody?

[Timbaland]
Baby girl
I'm the man from the big VA
Won't you come play round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
Timbaland
Don't you know I am the man
Rock shows here to Japan
Have people shaking-shaking my hand
Baby girl, better known as Aaliyah
Give me hives, corns, and high fevers
Make the playa haters believe us
Don'tcha know
Gotta tell somebody
Cause 

[Aaliyah]
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me you're that somebody

[Repeat CHORUS 2]

[Repeat CHORUS 1]

[Instrumental break]

[Aaliyah]
Is it my goal, is it your goal
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm bout it bout it
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody</pre>
