[Intro: Talib] + (Deonis Cook)
Yeah, sometimes it's hard bein a man
I try to explain that to my lady all the time
But yo
(Girls have, feelings, ooooooooooooooooooh)

[Talib Kweli]
My girl is a delicate flower
A super hero, bein a single mom helped develop her powers
We stay up to the elegant hour talkin, inhalin the sour
Reachin out to God cause the Devil a coward
But he still sit on my shoulder and whispers
It feels like my shoulder get colder the more that I listen
And now it seem like she ready to leave
We steady be beefin the main reason my desires of spreadin my seed
I try to tell her I'm just a man
She said "No you wrong cause you way more than that, you need to cut the scam
You not foolin me, that's lunacy
Them excuses might be new to them birds but they ain't new to me"
Yo I hate when the fit is thrown
It's like every time I pick up the phone you bitch and moan
Whoa, I'm like "Why you stressin for?"
I'm pressin Ignore, make me wanna never get involved

[Chorus: Talib Kweli] + (Deonis Cook)
I need to reap these benefits
Ooh, you so sensitive~!
I say serve this royalty
She say "I deserve your loyalty"
(Girls have, feelings, ooooooooooooooooooh)

[Talib Kweli]
Men lie out of fear but we front like we not afraid
Whether arguin or not, the bills gotta get paid
We are not in 6th grade, we fightin and people watchin
On Twitter she emo bloggin, I'm boilin her hemoglobin
It lead to sobbin, the arguments never move me
Cause we actin out the stereotypes like Tyler Perry movies
My indiscretions is reekin of deep betrayal
Libidos are like horses, it's hard to keep 'em stable
She believe me the way Michael believe in Fredo
But I need her, she the food for my soul, my sweet potato
Before I let her go I know she'll be forever gone
I can't leave when the weather wrong, I weather storms
She like Katrina, got me lookin for FEMA
Covetin my neighbor's lawn, the grass is lookin greener
But in reality it never is
Oh sure there's others but I'll never find a better..

[Outro: Deonis "Pumah" Cook]
Girls (girls) have (have) feelings (girls have feelings)
Girls have, feelings (ohhhh, girls)
Girls have, feelings (they surely surely do)
Oooooooooooooooooooh...

{"Girls have feelings, girls have feelings"}
{"Girls have feelings, ohhhhh"}
