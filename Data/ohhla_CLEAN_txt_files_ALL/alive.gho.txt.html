Cig: You ever ask yourself like "What's the point of it? Like why even wake
up anymore?" Shit, aint nuthin' ever gonna change man, same shit everyday. I
heard Erin's my guardian angel, well if that's the case, heaven watch over me
Yo

[Cig]
Got my moms personality, my fathers temper
Look into my eyes and stare, it's as cold as Decembers
The attitude is fuck it, anybody could get it
Whomever, whenever, I don't give a fuck, it's whatever
Days have been better, my nights have been worse
It's kind of hard lookin' at you Katy, up in a herse
I feel like I could've saved you from what you did
Say goodbye to someone you know since you were a 4 year old kid?
I can't do it, you said I could help you, I've been through it
Now I'm wishin' I took up your proposition but I blew it
And I knew it as soon as you committed suicide
I didn't say nuthin' but there was a tear in my eye
Which is hard, cause I don't show emotion, I got pride
I thought about it myself, but I decided to survive
In my brothers eyes, I'm a hero, he thinks I'mma make him rich
But I can't look at him and let him know it's cause of this weed that I pitch
Heard life's a bitch, well fuck it till you're done
Never tuck it, just buck it son, and never fuckin' run
And all this bullshit I don't deserve it none
Got me feelin' like I don't even deserve to cum, so

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder why I'm even alive
Like what's the point of it and why even try?
Outside we're happy but it's all just a lie
Join me and turn to angels up in the sky, as I puff my L

[Cig]
I gotta blow up, I gotta get signed, I gotta blow up, I gotta kick rhymes
I gotta do me, gotta stay on the grind, I gotta blow up, my life's on the line
Ask me bout the haters, they aint never blowin' up
They like cops in the hood: They aint never showin' up
A lot of friends need me to get my flowin' up
Gotta make a lot of ends, so I aint never slowin' up
Drunk all night with questions I ask God
Like "Why is it every week I get a mass card?"
It's hard, but Jaime wipe away the tears you cried
They say the good die young, and that's why I'm still alive
There's an angel in the sky that wants you to rise
Stay strong cause you got good friends by your side
And as for myself, know it would be a lie
If I was to say I don't ever ask myself "Why?"

[Chorus]

[Cig]
There's no words that express how much I love you
I rap so you don't have to sell drugs too
This phone keeps ringin' and I can't play Madden
Or a show in the city to get this deal rappin'
I'm sorry Michael, that I aint always there
But please understand that I really do care
Share a bond that they really can't match
Weather it's life issues or you wanna play catch
Cause you're the ruggedest youngin' that I know
And you're lookin' more like me the more that you grow
So when things are lookin' rough, I'mma guide you through it
Cause I been through it, I'mma help you ride through it
Pursue it, you aint gotta live the way I did
Aint gotta be a man yet, enjoy bein' a kid
I can't picture puttin' my life to an end
Cause he's more then a brother, he's my best friend

[Chorus]

Cig: This song is dedicated to all the angels we lost in 2005. To all those
who feel there is no hope, your loss is my pain, and I am your voice. Join me
and pray for a safer and better 2006. God bless your family. I feel so alive,
as I puff my L</pre>
