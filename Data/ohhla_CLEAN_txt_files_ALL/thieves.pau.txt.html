"I tried to be there but you wouldn't let me in
before hustlin' we were friends!"

 [True/Sha]
Damn what a price to pay
shows that torch you can't take away
now forever sleep is where your body'll lay
restin' in peace is what I hope and pray
Shit, what I will tell your moms
as she breakin' down in the brother's arms
but she don't know the truth so I've the only chance
he started buggin' callin' in the work
kept another theme so they called him Kirk
after he got caught he got real berserk
found out he was smokin' from a cavilled world
I wanted to be the first one to play it at
Yo son, I'd only sow but he used crack
and this is somethin' that I can't believe
comin' from A Prince among Thieves!

 [T-Bone]
"Sometimes I wondered but I didn't understand
just when you were trying to go, won you the bet
I tried to be there but you wouldn't let me in
before hustlin' we were friends!"

 [True/Sha]
I thought I would have been better if I'd just let'em be
but he started showin' two faces one for you one for me
I watched though change ?shit's so Mitchell what's re-strange?
leave on a train get dropped back off in a range
a friendship taken aback conceived ya coped gain
lookin' at your mummy, yah two can feel your pain
Yo son, my man, I didn't dig the trap
what in the world would have pushed him to do that
a god fearin' boy has high erased him
mummy don't blame yourself when you are gettin' praised
raisin' two kids strugglin' all alone
takin' what life had to offer your head on
each shows the take to row of a loser
a coped cane seller, a coped cane loser
reality's sometime hard to believe
but who ever thought it would have happened to the Prince among Thieves!

 [T-Bone]
"Sometimes I wondered but I didn't understand
just when you were trying to go, won you the bet
I tried to be there but you wouldn't let me in
before hustlin' we were friends!"
		
	&gt;Wutcha wanna do son, how do you feel?
	livin' in a life when everything is real 
	wutcha wanna do son? It was the deal
	livin' in a life when everything is right
	wutcha wanna do son, how do you feel?
	livin' in a life when everything is real
	wutcha wanna do son? It was the deal yo 
			     it was the deal yo
			     it was the deal!

 [True/Sha]
I never thought that losin' you would've left an inner space - in my heart
when I pull the out it ain't goin' no waste
and everytime I see your ?pseud? I remeber your face
I'm locatin', muddin' my way, raisin' like he was mine
I mean the joy brings me kinda hard to define
knowin' hot type of words, I shit clue to win
you was more like my brother but that fright me in
and since you came now your song has someone to depend 
aaw, so take this son and rest in peace
I wish would have know how I felt for you was diseased
forgave a shit enough time to get released
everytime I hear "Prince" I'ma remember you
"Among Thieves" what the fuck I ?putsch? it through

before hustlin' we were friends!"
