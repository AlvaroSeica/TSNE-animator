[Intro: The Reverend William Burk]
Yeah, yeah
Ah, ah
Yo, yo, yo

[The Reverend William Burk]
All these phony rappers engaged in rhyme bouts
Stand out like a white broad in a black muslim's house
Support (?) in their mouth, eatin' swine
Dude on the couch should be down for the count
If he ever battle me, no doubt
The crowd never shouts when you rhyme, they only check for the time
And sit there starin' at you, quiet as mimes
You wonderin' why they so silent, nobody's clappin'
Nobody's cheerin', nobody's likin' your rappin'
The reason why is because I ripped it before you
Now they're loyal to me and treatin' me like royalty
Do we have to make that clown from Apollo
Chase you of the stage just to make you go? You're movin' to slow
Good try though, hope you learned something
B U from these events R K's never frontin'
I keep it movin' better than the average human
With these lyrics I be usin' and the shows that I be doin'
Although I'm losin' my mind from all these MC's abusin' rhymes
Usin' the same lines, bitin' should be a crime
You should do time for not bein' original
Bein' a criminal, certain individuals are pitiful
I'm not gonna say any names 'cause that causes drama
*Cough* Get it, drama
Tupac is probably turnin' over in his grave
Thinkin' to himself "Damn, what's goin' on these days!"
Actually it's kinda funny
How every other video I see on BET is cash money
Not these guys again, talkin' bout the ice again
Is that all you write with pens
I'm just gettin' tired of hearin' the same content
Ninety percent of it's ritualized nonsense
Battle me to see a real MC in action
I dare you, I bet you I stop all your braggin'

[Chorus: The Reverend William Burk]
There's lots of MC's who claim that they thugs
Claim they got guns, but actually they don't
There's a lot of MC's who claim they got loot
Claim that they'll shoot, but actually they won't
There's a lot of MC's who claim that they hard
But the truth is, they got nothin' on the God
There's a lot of MC's who claim that they hot
Claim that they the bomb, but actually they not

[The Reverend William Burk]
There's no limit to my +Def Jams+
I'm so loud that the crowd had to cover their ears with both hands
It's every man for himself, nobody's gonna help
They're tryin' to get to the top alone, noone else
So what am I supposed to do to get up in this industry?
Pick the lock on the back door and break into it?
I don't think that's a good idea, 'cause if I do that
I might get mad and once I'm inside I'll take a hostage
And threaten to shoot him because his lyrics are garbage
Unless the crowd boos him and then you all acknowledge
I've got more vocabulary than your school library
Very revolutionary, military, visionary
I murder lames like Orenthal James
Did Nicole and Ron Goldman and claim I was framed
Then get Johnnie Coch' as my lawyer
(?) to the jury "You see this man who stands before ye?
He didn't murder all them MC's on purpose
He did it because the music business is a circus"
What really gets on my nerves is all these worthless
MC's who spit garbage for verses
You cats are doing the culture a disservice
I wouldn't care if I did put y'all in hearses
Then there'd be more room for the conscious MC's
Then there'd be more room for the revolutionaries
Who hate fake rappers and X-Men like Halle Berry
This is for the brothers never holdin' back on commentary
We hold it down from the first to the last word
In every sentence, and we takin' out the trash
Ye heard?

[Chorus x2]

[Outro: The Reverend William Burk]
But they not
Uh uh
B U, R K
All day</pre>
