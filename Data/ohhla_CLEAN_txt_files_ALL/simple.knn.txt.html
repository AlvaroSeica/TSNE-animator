Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Simple as it feels right now
With you right now right here right now
It took all this time all this time all this time
They say I came a long way and they don't mean em took the subway
Got sandals but no candles and shots fired for my birthday
In the kitchen mom's missing when she needs to cook for her children
In addition, I see killers in the corners taking lives like they on commision
But I keep on, on a mission survival is my addiction
And you people just love how I make it seem so simple

Simple as it feels right now with you right now right here right now
It took all this time and all this time and all this time

I say hi! introduction, she say hey! seduction
The talking the discussion might as well be in Russian
'Cause I'm not paying no attention she take me to a dimension
Where the mind is on suspension but the bodies on eruption
I used to be cold then she hold me close
And me fold like sheets so I love how she make it seem so simple

Simple as it feels right now with you right now right here right now
It took all this time and all this time and all this time
Simple as it feels right now with you right now right here right now
It took all this time and all this time and all this time

(So, so, so simple)
(So, so, so simple)
They make it seem so hard
They make you stay on your guard
Oh baby you won't believe
What the good days meant to me
They make it seem so hard
They make you stay on your guard
Seems like there's an enemy
Fighting our simplicity

Simple as it feels right now with you right now right here right now
It took all this time and all this time and all this time
Simple as it feels right now with you right now right here right now
It took all this time and all this time and all this time

Simple as it feels right now with you right now right here right now
It could be so simple,it could be so simple</pre>
