[King Just]
Heed the warning, get ready for this outburst, first things first
Any one front is getting put in the herse
On the voyage like Kirk, claiming new turf
The expert for grabbing the mic, and going to work
Like a nine to five, or better yet a job
Never unemployed cuz I fuck with the mob
It's hard, ya'll niggas can't hold me back
Check my stats, I'll be outshining niggas on tracks
Like that, speak Pulp Fiction, I speak facts
Alotta niggas hit the front, crab niggas hit the back
We attack from the dead side, it's from the secret room
Started all of us, die, then try
To reclame the name, but it's in vein
Cuz you ain't running with the grain
You should be ashamed, to your whole fam, my man
You didn't understand the plan, til you had to scram
We expand like coke in the pot, the six got it locked
Ya'll niggas fuck around and get rocked, why not?
Terrorist action, it's on...
You've been warned

[Chorus: King Just]
You've been warned (we on a come back)
You've been warned (we counter attack)
You've been warned (only the strong shall survive
Heed the warning and die)

[King Just]
Sabotage your entourage, here comes the mob
Putting pieces back on the map, yeah we on the job
Shit is hard, God, but I'm here to be living proof
You couldn't hang with my style if ya neck was in a noose
I get loose, and like the fucking movie I got "Juice"
You entered the dragon like Bruce, too late for a truce
The enemy is on the frontline, bottom line
Walking dead, them signs read flatline
Then deceased, and this is for my fam in the beast
And all the Gods that bring to the east, we increase
Like cell organisms that's spark izims
Dangerous, Black Fist terrorism
Worldwide, moving on the inside
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
You can try, but there's no way you'll escape
Unless you reside in that 53rd state
But wait, you think shit is deep, it gets deeper
We can meet in hell, walking dead, I'm the gate keeper
Grym reaper, ceremony preacher
Heat seeker, battle, I'mma beat cha
For sure, niggas don't want no more
I don't give a fuck yo it's war

[Chorus]

[King Just]
We hit the underground, railroad express, non stop
All aboard, secret war, lock your door
It ain't safe no more, but these rap acts think it is
Man they shady in this biz
Tryin' to put in a squeeze, have you beggin' on your knees
But my crew be making cheese, so we won't, do that shit, nigga please
You got to come better than that
With your ohkeedoke, nonsense, nursery rap
Bullcrap that you call a track that you put on wax
The question I ask, where's your heart at?
You should be slapped, for jumping both sides of the fence
Present or past tense, I leave MC's bent
Slumped over, walking dead is dead soldiers
Strap a ride, and survive, when the secret war was over
Watch the cobra, poisonous move, snooze you lose
And you choose to be butt, like a whole pack of Kool
Cigarettes, catch wreck, for my niggas and my niggarettes
Put your money down and bet
You know how I feel, kid I don't give a fuck
Life or death, choose, nigga, what?

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
