[Big Rube]
The Idea of Beautiful, let's begin:
Beauty is so much more than just skin
The feast of the eyes supplies a mere fraction of what lies within
Not just the curves of hips and lips 
It's the mind that draws me in
The fellowship of good friends even closer than blood kin
Love in, love out, is a route where we all win
Blue skies, green grass, clean oceans and calm winds
The family ties, bonds last, a child cries and life begins
Eventually ends, begins again, an infinite cycle of perfect tens
A infant disciple sent to recycle your knowledge is born of beautiful blends
So peace and blessings, long life, no stressin, true beauty effervescent from deep within
 
[Intro: Rapsody] 
Yo, Yo, I care about 'em too much..
{YOU NEED TA WAKE YO' ASS UP~!}
..to not say nuttin
They too beautiful, right?
{YOU NEED TA WAKE YO' ASS UP~!}
You got-ta get up, get out, and get somethin like..
{YOU NEED TA WAKE YO' ASS UP~!}
JAMLA, the squad, yo {YOU NEED TO -}
 
[Rapsody]
- wake yo' ass up, get yo' ass up
Water on yo' face, get yo' edges touched
Get yo'self a job, get yo'self a check
Give ya mama some, sleepin on her set
Every day you wake, jewelry on yo' neck
Got a lil' girl, she ain't got a dress 
Shoes or some socks, hardly seen it yet 
Playin Madden 12, brother get yo'self together
{YOU NEED TA WAKE YO' ASS UP~!} Empty liquor cup 
Spent the week drankin, money on some blunt 
No wonder you ain't bankin, wake yo' ass up, nigga 
Fuck it start thinkin, chillin in the cut 
Tryna be the man, rims on yo' car 
No gas in the can, boy get yo'self a plan 
{YOU NEED TA WAKE YO' ASS UP~!} Get yo'self a goal
Wanna be a star? Heh, take it in the hole
Shoot in the cold, get a early start 
Get up early baby when nobody in the park
Two-a-days like the Ark, practice on yo' skill
Shoot it in the dark, baby you a star
{YOU NEED TA WAKE YO' ASS UP~!} Friends that you love 
Saw 'em last week, huggin on your girl 
Trust ain't real, baby this real 
Only trust niggaz, that wanna see you build
{YOU NEED TA WAKE YO' ASS UP~!} Hangin in the club 
Wednesday to Sunday, pourin in yo' cup
Pourin in yo' cup, pourin in yo' cup
Why you think liquor stores on every corner that we strut?
Need ta wake yo' ass up - Shelton Spike Jackson 
Mentally we packin, AKs' and Magnums
Radio a daily mind-FUUUCK if you ask 'em
But the average wouldnÂ’t know it - Bo Jackson
Need ta {WAKE YO' ASS UP~!} We royal like Tut 
King's baby boy, hold yo' head up
Gon' wake yo' ass up, need to wake yo' ass up
Wake yo' ass up, yo wake yo' ass up like
{YOU NEED TA WAKE YO' ASS UP~!}</pre>
