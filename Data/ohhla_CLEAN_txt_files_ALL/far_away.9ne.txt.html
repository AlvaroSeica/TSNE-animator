Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro - Tech N9ne]
Man...
I cant even picture myself
Not breathin
...but its certain

[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
I love too much
I love too many to count em
So extras and pets its easy for me to go on without em
Cause everything goes away
Love it eventually gets stowed away
Why does it have to be when you're breathin when even
And then you're heated wonderin why is it cold today
Immortal its fake and impossible
But everytime I look up I'm shakin an obstacle
Whats gonna happen when time is up and I gotsta go
Beautiful lands are took away from my opticle
Its not that I'm afraid of death
But afraid of the thought of my people laid to rest
They're sayin theres six million ways of death
But not even money way could fade the stress
Its certain...
That a person...
Got somebody lookin workin to close the curtain
Or maybe something...
Outta some dream...
With a devilish soul for hurtin
Sometime I be wishing I didn't love...
Cause when its away I be missin love...
Your mother your father your children are livin to die from the crib then a ditch is dug
From the process...
I get naucious...
Cause I cant see my death and its causes
Pac he saw it around the corner
But me not breathin is a pound of balogna
I keep fightin and I'm tryin...
To get right in my mind bryan...
Cause one day I'm gonna see you even though I cant picture the 9 dyin
I'm flyin....

[Chorus]
Far far away from here (n nothin I can do about it)
Everything I love go away from here (I'm wishin I could do without it)
(I think you're gonna go)
Far far away from here (n nothin I can do about it)
Everything I love go away from here (I'm wishin I could do without it)

[Verse 2 - Krizz Kaliko]
See I tried to call for you father
But nobody answered
And I tried to scream out loud
But nobody pampered
But your leadin tomorrow
And I'm just a youngster
I'm deep in the sorrow
But nobody wants to(die)
Now I gotta try to get from pain I'm never escapin ya
Maybe I did to much to you you you by forsakin ya
And now I see a reflection of you off in my son
Cause hes the same complexion of you color of the sun
And now I'm done baby makin hatin it to even see my baby sleep
Cause he gotta die one day or barely deadly deep
And I'm stayin too far away from him
Spend too many days from him
Tears steadily fallin I'm creatin em
And its getting colder you getting older year by year
Never know when you gotta go far away from here
Listen here...

[Chorus]

[guitar solo - 4 BARS]

[Outro - Tech N9ne]
Far far away from here
Everything I love go away from here</pre>
