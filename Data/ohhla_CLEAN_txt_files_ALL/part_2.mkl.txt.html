[Kurupt]
With so much drama, I'mma have to refocus
The incense and aroma of hematomas
Symptoms of a coma, sleeping, awaken
Baking, I drop bombs like Hiroshima
Elegant in a beemer, face bumping in mines
All she wanna do is get inside
Then she got inside, talking bout letting me ride
I stay regulating, since craters was the day ins
Free Tracy Davis, TC'll chill
Cuz ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
And if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, they already know
That I don't fuck with no bustas
And I don't fuck with no, and I don't fucking know
So don't ask me shit, give a fuck about a dance
Yelling 187, with my dick in her mouth, bitch
Yelling 187, with my dick in her mouth, bitch</pre>
