(Mythological)

When I get ill there's a reason cause it's duck season
Hunter of the fronter, though it's not pleasin
To know that rappers are false advocatin
Shootin me prisons but see I'm waitin
For one of you to slip up and make a mistake
Just to mention my name, that is all it would take
For me to serve like a waiter, deliver and cater
Seek and destroy like a rap exterminator
My murderin is legal, do damage to your ego
Try to defy, but adios amigo
You shoulda been smarter, to know you're not harder
As far as I'm concerned you are just a part of
Another dimension, I pay no attention
To, you were through if you knew like I knew
Wanna battle me, get up and walk into the set-up
You're tempted to rock but the mind said: Shut up!
And listen to the master because I'm rulin
Schoolin while I'm jewelin, just ridiculin
You false advocators, to whom it concerns
Mythological rappers, you got a lot to learn

(Mythological)

I throw a rhyme like a pitch jettin over the plate
Think that you're the big hitter, you swung too late
Five that I threw did somethin to you
Until the very last count is just 3 and 2
Bein just an individual you all are the same
I throw a strike, drop the mike because you're out of the game
See, I am the major league, others are minor
There is no one that could ever be finer
When it comes to performin you are obsolete
Put down the microphone and walk away from the beat
This job is for a man, you don't qualify
I think that you are very dumb to even try to apply
And to think, you try to prove that you're intelligent
Your IQ is very low, I find it relevant
To this point, which you are missin, still you keep dissin
Remember, you were never ever competition
For a brother like me, though when I perform
I get the booty hole warm like the quiet storm
I go to work and go bezerk and work ya out your skirt
You really dig me cause I'm thick but then you think it would hurt
But see you told me you're a woman, I guess you can hang
Don't blame it on me if I hurt yo thang

(Mythological)

I see that rap is gettin older, and so are MC's
Old age could never catch rhymes like these
Which are unapprehendable, others are expendable
I qualify and rely upon dependable
Thoughts that I can radiate, hold up, wait
Let me show and prove in the way that I can demonstrate
(Mythological)
I make you furious and curious, I'm glorious, victorious
And if you listen close you'll find the moral of the story is
Sent in a printed mail to the residence of a duck
That I should pluck just for pressin your luck
While I'm defeatin and succeedin in givin you the beatin
Hospitals will be treatin once you start bleedin
You will need a intravenous for fightin with the meanest
And there will be no witnesses to say that they have seen this
Crime perpetrated, now that I demonstrated
I must apologize for the time you waited

(Mythological)

So if you wanna get busy, boy, I make you dizzy
Sayin rhymes so shockin I make your hair frizzy
You wanna know my name, you don't deserve to know
Amateurs like you shouldn't mess with a pro
Cause I'm rated as the best over everyone else
No rater was needed because I rated myself
But still I'm cool with a lot of good fellas
The ones who I'm not cool with are all jealous
Knew about me back in '83
Four years, you're still showin jealousy
You're even holdin a grudge but brother I won't budge
Try to take me to court, you'll find I'm cool with the judge
Best move you could make is a move to surrender
Sayin that you're hard, I think you look tender
Soft, break north
Knucklehead, step off

(Mythological)

These are not my best lines, not even my fresh lines
I know every move and you're still tryin to guess mine
That is the mysterious, makin you delirious
Rapper on the microphone, I'm serious
About my lyrics, flowin with energy
My artillery, weapon for the enemy
Pushin with the power of a generator
Attractin the attention of every spectator
Who is lookin and starin and comparin
Rappers are cryin, cussin and swearin
Callin me names, but I can't hear 'em
They always get nervous every time I go near 'em
Soft like tissue, fear is the issue
Just when you least expect that I'll diss you
I take away your title, I make you bow
I'm the King and I have spoken, and I mean now
So drop to your knees and lower your head
Don't think about repellin one word I said
For the penalty is death, I'll see that you burn
Mythological rappers, you got a lot to learn

(Mythological)

For all you big word users and bass tone speakers
You're nothin but the soles of an old pair of sneakers
You're worn out, you're dogged, you're turnin grey
The only thing to do is just to throw you away
You're no longer any good, and this is a fact
But you'll lose your respect to a lotta new jacks
So if you are such a scholar, why can't you make a dollar
You oughta make plans with the funeral parlor
Dig the grave deeper, meet the grim reaper
Sign on the line and resign, it's cheaper
For you to fade away, but it's okay
For you to come and see me rock at the party one day
You'll see that I'm the reignin rock champion
So you have witnessed the rise of the mighty King Sun

Mythological ducks, take this

The Gangster Team
My man D-MÃ¶et
And I ain't even mad at y'all
