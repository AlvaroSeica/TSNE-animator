Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Blow up
World Star before rap, you already know that
So Fresh Prince, they are about to bring the show back
Listening to Kilo, weekend cost a kilo
Hair so long, I'm about to bring the fro back
Don't call gotta say mushy mushy
Girlfriend actin' all washy washy
It's your birthday, make it earthquake
Gonna love with a nigga like a mermaid
That's a first date
Nobody think about it worst case
Best case, we the front page
10K on the first day
Yeah, motherfucker, take your phone out
To record this
Ain't nobody can ignore this
I'm more or less, I'm more or less individual
Making movies with criminals
Tryin' to get them residuals
When it all go crazy
When I hear that action, I'm a be Scorcese
(My nigga, hold it horizontal)

(WorldStar!)

[Verse 2]
My girl ain't bad, she more like evil
When I'm lookin' in the mirror, how fly's this negro?
She on Hollywood and Vine
Thinkin' she Hollywood on Vine
Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk
But I saw through it like a wet shirt
Drive slow cause you might swerve off bitch
Still heat and it ain't so soft bitch
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffin
Got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop
When I heard shots
Watchin' dude drop from a Glock at a -
[Shots fired]
Let me flash on 'em
We all big brother now
Lil' sis, let her run around
Money talkin', you not sound
Brrrr, money count 'em
Brrrr, AK
Brrrr, cell phone
Brrrr, hello?

[Interlude]
Yo, bro man, check out that video I just sent you, man.
This shit's hilarious, man.
It's like this kid, man, he got like, he got like hit on the side of the head, man, he's like freakin' out.
It's like... [?]

[Outro]
We don't wanna be a (WorldStar!)
And all I wanna be is a (WorldStar!)</pre>
