Y'all know how we do it man I leave 'em Mega flustered
I'm the only +Mega Man+ and you're a +Mega Buster+
Sick as roboenza and think it's time to end ya
Incapacitate the game and all of its members
Gimme the triple blade, water shield, solar blaze, chill spike
Check the nuts and bolts and screw 'em on real tight
Don't wait up, cause this might be long one
I ain't comin back until they're all done
It was like a quiz show, and Mega picked the wrong one
Blue bomber loves lasagna now it's time to make some sauce run
Toss one, after the next, with the wheel cutter
Crab puncher or whatever trust they will suffer
Whether Proto is there or not, I don't care a lot
All I need is to be is the strongest, head of the flock
Evil energy capsules got me dashin
Double jumpin, bustin long as the beats pumpin
Let me tell you somethin, no pleasure it's all pain
It's my game, you're small change

[Chorus]
My name is
{"BASS!"} That's my name and don't forget it
Anytime and anywhere, I'm always down to set it, let's get it
{"How low can you go?"} As low as I need to
I proved that I'm the strongest, fool we don't need you
My name is {"BASS!"} Takin down these junk bots with one shot
The fun stops
{"Badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad"}

[Random]
Shot caller, mean as a Rottweiler
Fitted with shock collars, I'm ready to stop all of
your play, my +Forte+ is guns not swordplay
Enemies be warned cause you in for a short stay
It's your day, so I just adjust the levels on 'em
I tried to warn 'em now I gotta sick +Treble+ on 'em
"ROAR!" Wily built me and broke the mold
So it's no doubt that I'm the strongest and highest on the totem pole
He's got no control, give it up for free will
If he was smarter, he'd have probably had me killed
So dont think we friends or we associates
I'll deal with you later on when it's appropriate
But for now on roboenza's where my focus is
This is another sick scheme, I know it is
One Bass buster blast and his whole games through
I won't give him a chance like you always do
You know what they say about he who hesitates in war
He who hesitates is lost, my name is

[Chorus]</pre>
