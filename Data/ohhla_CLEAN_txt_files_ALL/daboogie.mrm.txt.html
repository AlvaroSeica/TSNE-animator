[Mr. Mike]
It's goin' down no matter what side of town you niggaz claimin'
I'm gamin' like game is up, the card was dealt, now who's playin'?
Got my bitch off safety (why?) In case some shit start to get shady
Cause even my so called homies lookin' crazy (oh okay)
If I don't make it, all you too true niggaz protect my baby
I'm tryin' to make history while y'all niggaz still livin' in the '80s
Contrary to what you say, we gets it on like Marvin Gaye
Went from starvin' now I'm mobby, lob in-state every day
Heads be bobbin' "Back &amp; Forth" like Aaliyah when I come see ya
(Boo-ya!) Ya dig? Hang you from a bridge, see ya wouldn't wanna be ya
Not a new jack, but my city's off the fuckin' hook with crooks
Take a look, it's Mr. Mike all in your life, now you shook
If I got booked tonight, best believe tomorrow mornin' I'm gone
Back to the streets as we commence to get our boogie on
I could be wrong but the hood needed a song we could bang to
Swang to, hang to, for G's to do they thang to

[Chorus]
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie

[Mr. Mike]
The murder analyst, scandalous for some lavish shit
My gangsta establishment got a band of bitches tradin' panties for riches
In the land of the snitches, and bitch niggaz who complex
Who gets wicked like X-Files now? Check out my bomb threat
We raise hell, from ATL to Chi-Town to South Bronx
To the 5th Ward to South Park, won't leave the playground 'til it got dark
And still ain't headed home, I set the Tone like Loc
And won't be captured by these snatches, to the rapture I'll be smoked
The total shock again, you're stoppin' when I stop you niggaz oxygen
But flowin' freely, I'm resurrected like a G be
You see me on TV, but look around, I'm right behind ya
Dancin' on your shadow, don't try to see me I might blind ya
Now put your life on the line, this time you've been confined
By the Boogie Man himself, we all we got left
So play the game for self and gangsta boogie 'til your last breath
It's Mr. Mike and tonight might be your last step

[Chorus]
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie</pre>
