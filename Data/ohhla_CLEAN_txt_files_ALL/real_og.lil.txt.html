Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We can't never live that thug shit for life
Yea, checking the wrists
Bout to check the time
Nah, you know what?
Aye diver, what's the time?
You feel me?

Lil B, where you been, I just got out the state
You did some time? Yea I did, I just cleaned my case
How your cousins doing? You know we pitching art every day
I'm in field head first, niggas watch my plate
I'd watch theirs but I never eat their food or take it
But you cut niggas off, yea, fuck them fakes
I'm a tell you this my life is so real that it's great
Bitch I come from the crack like the pavement sayin this
I'm shakin shit, I hit the dice game no playin
Nigga hit the dice, hit for no fuck that playin
Shoot dice with the pitch, bitch move or I'm stayin
You got love for these hoes, know all bitches be fakin
They ain't recognize game, I'm sayin fuck all these suckas that hate millers
Bitch I live in the miller
Full for Glock and if you clear it
You bout that life, I'm bout whatever
Fa rilla

How I make it through the hood, it's crazy
I'm a do what I do, fuck for daisies
Now I know what I know, I'm a take it low
I'm a take it low, I'm a take it low

How I make it through the day, you're ahead, it's crazy
I'm a do what I do, bitches fuck for daisies
Now I know what I know, I'm a take it low
I'm a take it low, I'm a take it low

How you maintain and be I'm getting by, I'm straight
I'm still tucked with the petus, get back the piece
Niggas relax with the beef, I'm swimming in the foam
Taking showers with the gun born to sleep with my pomp
You would think that I'm drunk how I'm throwin up the shots
West side like 2 Pac, east side like Biggie
Niggas look up to me, I give back too many
What's next Lil B, bitch you tell me
I'm success, meta meta excellence
Ain't no stressin, no worries
Like Lil Wayne said, infrared
Aiming for suckas heads, I can tell
I never left, I could never fall off because I was never on
But you girls seein whenever I'm on
It's too good to perform, the story not long
Everybody got a job, you gotta keep shit going

How I make it through the hood, it's crazy
I'm a do what I do, fuck for daisies
Now I know what I know, I'm a take it low
I'm a take it low, I'm a take it low

How I make it through the day, you're ahead, it's crazy
I'm a do what I do, bitches fuck for daisies
Now I know what I know, I'm a take it low
I'm a take it low, I'm a take it low</pre>
