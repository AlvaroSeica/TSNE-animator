"Neo... SONIC, SONIC..."

[MC Lars]
Yeah I said it, nerdcore died
Blogged in a line and they all asked why
Now I'm the bad guy cause all I did was try
to start a dialogue on just what went awry
Stop whining~! You've gotta learn the basics
Your album was a trainwreck, I know it's hard to face it
Basically, you debased the scene
Chased a little dream and you called me mean
when all I did was call the jumper's time of death
Gave props to some rappers that I thought were the best
but you didn't make the list - you felt dissed!
Wrote some simple rhymes that you said I dismissed
You 8-bit beast, I end the stagnation
All about your X-Box and your PlayStation
... Feeling it, I'm not
Your CD wasn't hot, I guess you had your shot!

[Random]
I know a lot of rappers who make full claim
to be deep in the game but they secretly lame
And when I hear they records I start laughin it up
And I wanna tell 'em, "Please stop rappin - you suck!"
But I don't - cause who am I to crush a dream?
Because I love hip-hop, I got love for the scene
But the fact is that many artists rarely try they hardest
So they don't spend the dough to make productions clean
I rapped on beats that were game related
To my surprise, half of the game related
The other half all became angry haters
who were mad at Mega Ran cause they ain't create it
We all had an NES and hummed all the tunes
But good music ain't usually done in your room
So do your thing dawgs, but don't get sore
cause I don't hang around your forum much any more
Cause I don't have time for a message board beef
I'd rather play games though and listen to the beats
Or make good music that folks wanna listen to
Don't get it mixed up, Random ain't dissin you
Not that I'm too big to hang out again wit'chu
Represent yourself in a manner that's offic-ial
Think of who you listen to, imitate, then innovate
Come original, then I get at you

[Chorus: Random]
Is nerdcore dope? Is nerdcore whack?
Is nerdcore fiction? Is nerdcore fact? (You tell me)
Is nerdcore amateur? Is nerdcore broke?
Should nerdcore stay or should nerdcore go? (You tell me)
Is nerdcore real? Is nerdcore fake?
Is nerdcore lover or does nerdcore hate? (Tell me)
Does nerdcore matter? Is nerdcore proven?
Is nerdcore winnin? Is nerdcore losin? (You tell me)

[MC Lars]
I got love for the kids with the laptops
Up in the lab making crunkcore rap rock
Writing the rhymes just to spray flowin non-stop
Putting a name to the styles in a headlock
I got love for the kids with their labels
Making those beats with their Technic turntables
Flippin the script like a dope Aesop fable
Killin the tracks just like Cain he slayed Abel
Look - all I want to see is amazing art
Invest your heart, and play your part
Perfect your craft and straight do you
If you don't do you then who's going to?
Just push it, push it, make it awesome
Build those concepts get it poppin
There's no stoppin you when your voice
makes the world go WHAT like your name was James Joyce

[Random]
I made the same choice, back when I was young
Tried to make beats on my 3S1
Made a pact to keep it true and BS none
Wrote raps on the stoop, look how far we've come
Success is a journey, not a destination
So thank God I was blessed with patience
I never been down with this type cash nonsense
Non-conscience, what are your unconscious?
I showed you how to plot a career
How to astonish your peers and then I ride on some ears
So take that backpack nerd rap label off Random
and slap it on a bottle of beer, you hear?
It's impossible to categorize me
Can't say that anything that's happened suprise me
They still ain't figurin it out, sittin in the house
Clickin on they mouse, just bickering about nerdcore

[Chorus]</pre>
