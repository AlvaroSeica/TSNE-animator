Song:   Fire in Freetown
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

There is no way to write it... there is no way to fight it
And I kick and scream but you got me despite it
And I got my pride so I begin to hide it
Like fire in Freetown you begin to light it...

[Chorus]
Aha aha aha
Sidii hogasha roobka
Ah ah aha you shine down upon me
Aha aha aha Sidii hogasha roobka aha aha aha you shine down upon me

By some higher order you keep getting bolder...
By god or by country you kill like a soldier...
By some riddle you sung little but scream mighty stronger
Like fire in free town you old magic spoiler...

[Chorus]

You place pins in my ribs and ask me to lie down
My pain is your pleasure but pleasure is all mine
You lend me your false ear and I lend you my false lines
Like fire in free town I'm fueled by your gold mine

[Chorus]

There's no way to right (or write) it, there's no way to fight it
But I kick and scream and but you got me despite it
And I got my pride so I begin to fight it
Like fire in Freetown you begin to light it

(Fire, fire)
She pulled out her match and she burned down my home
(Fire, fire)
She always come find me she know where I roam
(Fire, fire)
She know where to touch me to turn me to stone
(Fire, fire)
She come like a storm and she rain on my lawn
(Fire, fire)
She know where to touch me to turn me to stone
(Fire, fire)
She always come find me she know where I roam
(Fire, fire)
She pulled out her match and she burned down my home</pre>
