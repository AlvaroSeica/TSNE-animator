[Travis Scott]
I can't wait...
I can't wait, just to shit on you

This one for the fuck fake niggas 
That love to just hate, dawg
Always talkin' that wild shit
See 'em never let them verbs off
All these fuckin' missed calls
Might delete the whole call log
Thousand dollars for the jeans, fam
She grip 'em when a nigga swerve off
Think I need a desert A
Need to zip my face
Thinkin' they know Jacques
Niggas don't know me
Grew up on my lonestar
Niggas roll that weed
(NIGGAS ROLL THAT, NIGGAS ROLL THAT
NIGGAS ROLL THAT, NIGGAS ROLL THAT WEED)

[Chorus]
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you
Just to shit on you; I can't wait, just to shit on you

[Outro]
Goodbye, Travis...
Dim, the, lights (lights, lights, lights, lights, lights...)
YEEEEEAAAAAH! I can't wait, just to shit on you
I, I, I can't wait, just to shit on you...</pre>
