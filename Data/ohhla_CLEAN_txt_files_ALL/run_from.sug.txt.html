[Shug]
Gotta shoot my way up out this motherfucker should I hear the cops comin
I better start runnin
They ran out of shells, the clip's loaded
I hit two of them pigs, buck buck, try to jack me now fool
Down the nearest the backstreet, damn I'm on feet
Watchin every car, cause the punks tryin to creep
Western Hills, oh Western Hills here I come
Runnin from the undercover cop ain't no fun
Crooked-ass cops just shootin up shit like it ain't no thang
Tryin to start up the gangbang
In my hood ain't no fuckin set trippin
Niggaz do the bleedin, cops do the crip-plin
You mother-fuckers dare shoot my cousin in the back
Killed him on the spot pig~!
It's open prey on the black head
Shoot 'til the black's dead

[Chorus]
Run, better run little brother, they killin off our color
Run from the undercover
Run, better run little brother
Here comes the undercover, run from the undercover

{*police radio - can't be transcribed*}

[Shug]
Fuck I see a light
Better duck behind a bush, and stay outta fuckin sight
Now we gon' ride, the coast is clear
Let me get the fuck up outta here
Wasn't long before I get to 36 and Campbell
That's a motherfuckin gamble (SHIT~!)
Damn I hear shots
It's the God damn cops, shootin up my block
Motherfuckin cops ain't no good
I guess they want to be pigs in the hood
They want me dead
Shug is the nigga in the God damn, hear what I said
They must be shootin bombs
Got the whole block lit up, like fuckin Vietnam
Raidin the house of a black lady
She ain't got no drugs, just her and her baby
They lookin for her son
Run little brother run little brother run

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Shug]
FUCK YOU MOTHERFUCKERS~! That's what I'm yellin out
Cause they gettin too close to my house
And got no warrants, but still breakin in, shit
Ain't, that, a bitch!
My whole family's home
They wanna kill the lil' black boy, before he gets grown
I shoot through the back way
Gotta bam on the door, left my keys home that day
Moms opened up
Cryin like a motherfucker, damn, I can't get stuck
Moms they after me
Cause I'm a nightstalker with white hoes on the stroll
Cause I'm the mack
Teachin little black kids, how to kick facts
Damn I hear 'em comin
Fin' to break down the door, y'all start runnin
I'ma hold 'em off for a second
I only got one weapon
My little brother yellin out PACK COME
Let 'em kill me, run little brother run

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
