[Talking - Trae]
Aiiyo these headphones cut up?
Damn we finna do this all over again

(Chorus - Trae)
I really miss my dawg, I really miss my dawg
I really miss my dawg, I really miss my dawg

[Bridge - Trae + Z-Ro]
I love to roam the streets, it gives me what I need
to make it through the day - so what you gotta say? 
I gotta survive, I gotta survive
I gotta survive, I gotta survive, I gotta survive
I love to smoke the weed, it gives me what I need
to make it through the day - so what ya gotta say?
I gotta survive, I gotta survive
I gotta survive, I gotta survive, I gotta survive

[Verse 1 - Trae]
Hey ain't no mo'sunny days for me is what they tellin me
I'm runnin with this pain and can't shake it like it's a felony
I seen my partna go the other day
I only can imagine and wish he went another way
my homie gone and here I go doin this song to tell him how I feel
I hate it's in this way but I promised him I would keep it real
life goes on I wish that time was sittin still
but since it ain't I know that I got a couple of shoes to feel
I dedicate this to H - A - Dub K
M - O - E, Mr.Pat, And Screw I pray that they okay
my brother doin life - two of my sisters dead
a couple of partnas on the state, and some of e'm on the feds
all this pressure got it kind of hard to hold my head
but I'm a solja, taught to never fold unless I'm old and dead
you might get lost from tryna look in my eyes
but if you feelin like I'm feelin go on and reach for the sky, and let e'm know

(Chorus - Z-Ro)
I really miss my dawg, I really miss my dawg
I really miss my dawg, I really miss my dawg
I really miss my dawg, I really miss my dawg
I really miss my dawg, I really miss my dawg

[Verse 2 - Z-Ro]
So many obituaries, homies and cemetaries
too many memories this heart ache is too heavy to carry
it seem like every year at this time it don't never change
lookin for the sun to come out, it don't do nothin but rain
it's like a mandatory kick out - that this feelin is list out
and if you won't it you'll die before you can get out
takin a trip to the store ain't a regular ride no more
cause you might not make it back home - one day you here and then you gone
E - Mo, Jody, L - L, Budda Boy, and Malik
Big Steve, Big Mello, Big Hawk, Big Moe, then P - A - T
some were murdered, some had accidental death, some from natural causes
man I'm so tired of pullin my black suit out of the closet
the same home boy I use to blow big with
got his head cut off I still wonder who did the shit
cause it's fucked up ain't it? Daddy ain't around to watch Junior grow up
but Junior still in the window waitin on Daddy to show up

(Chorus - Z-Ro)
I really miss my dawg, I really miss my dawg
I really miss my dawg, I really miss my dawg
I really miss my dawg, I really miss my dawg
I really miss my dawg, I really miss my dawg

[Bridge - Trae + Z-Ro]
I love to roam the streets, it gives me what I need
to make it through the day - so what you gotta say? 
I gotta survive, I gotta survive
I gotta survive, I gotta survive, I gotta survive
I love to smoke the weed, it gives me what I need
to make it through the day - so what ya gotta say?
I gotta survive, I gotta survive
I gotta survive, I gotta survive, I gotta survive</pre>
