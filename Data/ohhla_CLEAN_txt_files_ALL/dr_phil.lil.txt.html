[Lil B]
(I'm so fuckin swagged up~! oh my God!) {*phone rings*}
Bitch fuck with me 'cause you know I'm straight hustlin
Twelve cellphones with them Ks' like a Russian (Swag!)
Straight servin Js', yeah I'm strapped like a hustler
Buy a lil' pussy that yo' bitches wanna fuck some
(You that nigga B! Oh my God!)
Damn it's a party crackin like it's Bar Mitzvah
Thirty-six bitches on my dick 'cause I'm Sisqo
No homo bitch, I got broads out in 'Frisco..
(Oh my God, I-I got bitches! Suck my dick, bitch!!)
Ask my bitch if she limbo (Swag!)
Bitch better speak 'cause she know I play Nintendo
Bitch kiss my ring and she call me Carl's Winslow (Swag!)
(I got about 500 bitches! All of 'em love me! 
 Oh my God?, all my bitches love me!)
Ridin up on Tonka (Oh my god!)
Strapped with two 9s' and they call me Willy Wonka
Crack a hoe head and I'm workin like a farmer
(Oh my God, I'm workin, twerkin and fuckin bitches!)
Tam can sell guns and I'm cold like Norway
1989, put my bitch on a four-way
Heavily swaggin, bitch check (my meter)
Pay her whole rent and she call me Cousin Skeeter
(We got money, we cashin out! Fuck a bitch~!)
Why you hand-cuffin dudes? You a wife-beater
Bitch fuck with me, I pay that bitch when I see her..
(Pay a bitch head! Pay for head, I'm payin for head!)
Bitch fuck with me, I'ma tell her when I see her (Swag!)
Young Based God nigga, swag off the meter
Young Based God buy a bitch like Rizla
Strapped with two 9s' and they call me Quincy Jones
Got a AK and I look like Al Capone (swag!)
Word around town I got five going for ten
Word around town I puts that Yin in that Yang
Ninety-eight bitches and they call me Stephen King - Based God
{We're sorry, the number you have dialed is not in service at this time..}
