Typed by: AZ Lyrics

For all these years you have been my lover
For all these years you have been my friend
The only solid part of my mind
My lifeline has turned to thin air

Like the drag that I just took and breathed out from my cigarette
And the smoke just disappeared way quicker than I can forget
And the ash is crumbling, I'm left with nothing
And I can't see you at all

You can close the door and take everything we have but
Just don't take my sanity with you
You can take it all and not even look back but
Just don't take my sanity with you

You can take it all from me
And leave no net for the fall, no
You just took it all
Now I can't have it
I've lost my habit

I'm craving you, my lover
I'm missing my best friend
You were the apple of my eye
And I can't find whatever once was there

Like the drag that I just took and breathed out from my cigarette
And the smoke just disappeared way quicker than I can forget
And the ash is crumbling, I'm left with nothing
And I can't see you at all

You can close the door and take everything we have but
Just don't take my sanity with you
You can take it all and not even look back but
Just don't take my sanity with you

You can take it all from me
And leave no net for the fall, no
You just took it all
Now I can't have it
I've lost my habit

I think I'm losing my mind
I won't let you take my sanity away from me cause it's the only thing you left behind

You can close the door and take everything we have but
Just don't take my sanity with you
You can take it all and not even look back but
Just don't take my sanity with you

You can take it all from me
And leave no net for the fall, no

You can close the door and take everything we have but
Just don't take my sanity with you
You can take it all and not even look back but
Just don't take my sanity with you

You can take it all from me
And leave no net for the fall, no
You just took it all
Now I can't have it
I've lost my habit

I've lost my habit [fading]</pre>
