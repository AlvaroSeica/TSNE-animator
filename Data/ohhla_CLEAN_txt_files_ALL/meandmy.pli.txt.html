[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
I keep a couple killers 'round me when I move
Cause I don't really fuck with a lot of these dudes
You won't rob me, but I might rob you
So when you see me you gon' see my goons

[Plies]
Couple killers on my right, couple killers on my left
But I am a motherfuckin killa myself
Got my Glock 40 right up under my belt
Hit you with this burner and you will melt
I only hang with my goons and nobody else
So you better keep yer hands to yer-self
When I say I'm ready, then we gon' step
You ain't got enough guns, you gon' need some help
Make sure this what you want cause we will shoot you to death
Cause we a little silly, we is bad for yo' health
All of us stay with it, all of us stay strapped
That's why I keep all my goons on deck

[Chorus]

[Plies]
Smell the liqour on my breath, smell the 'dro on my skin
Look, they throwin big faces in the wind
I am not friendly and I'm not yer friend
Gave the bouncer two hundred he slipped my fire in
Whenever y'all ready, let the shootin games begin
I'm walkin kinda slow cause my fire big
Either y'all better chill or we gon' mess up y'all gig
We all lookin crazy cause all of us bent
My goons paranoid so please don't flinch
Cause all my goons ain't got good sense
We all dead drunk, and all of us lit
But I love my goons cause they tote they shit

[Chorus]

[Plies]
I ain't come solo tonight, I'm with my clique
I haven't seen her since I fucked that bitch
And I haven't called her so I know she sick
Pushed her off on the goons let one of them hit
Cause I gotta stay focused cause these niggaz real slick
You will not rob me, turn around and sell my shit
Keep my eyes open cause it happen real quick
How many of us with fire, hmmm, 'bout six

[Chorus]</pre>
