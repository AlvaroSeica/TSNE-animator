[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, ma, I should of listened to you
I wouldn't be in this shit I'm in now

[Dom Pachino]
I take no prisoners, listen, I give 'em the business
They inherited a problem when they fuck with this kid
Got soul like Christmas, eat your food like Thanksgiving
Dropping albums like they hot and that's the way I make my living
I'm, ghetto and rep the S.I. borough
Where these ice grillin' niggas think they superheros
Next day the'll be a mural, this is all real-o
I wouldn't talk it if I ain't seen it, lived it or bare witness
The sick shit, is the environment we living in
Children get subjected to violence, and pure ignorance
It's pure negligence, on our behalf
But most don't take the time to do the math
So the kids suffer and every day it get rougher
That gang shit is weak, you either face jail or the gutter
So I only wish I listened to my mother
When she told me...

[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino]
Mommy always told me, get out, be easy
Todo suave, don't get your hands greasy
But I didn't listen, had to learn for myself
And that's why, I'm all fucked up

[Dom Pachino]
I should of listened to mommy, when she told me 'be easy'
But I was too stubborn and busy, slingin' them things
Had clientele from out of state, you should of seen
Money wasn't a thing, the problem was, getting it clean
By any means, I had to get it, I was stuck on green
Like getting wetted, on certain grooves
You wanna learn, there's certain tools, but only move with a certain few
A pack of goons that'll curtain you
For certain, we got purple, too
We got white all night, plus zanax and perks for you
Matter fact, whatever works for you
It's your choice, you just hurting you
And mommy always told me, get out, be easy
Got drugs, got guns, for sheezy, I didn't listen
But I'm bout to learn, since I'm on my own mission...

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
