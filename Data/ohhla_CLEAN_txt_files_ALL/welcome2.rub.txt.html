Song:   Welcome 2 Da Bricks
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Rubbabandz]
You can find me in the Bricks (grinding like a mutha)
Stacking up my chips (grinding like my mutha)
Hammer on my hip (just in case a mutha)
They don't wanna trip (game over like Flip)

[Rubbabandz]
All eyes on the prize, gleem like a high beem
Seven sixty Beemer, one hell of a machine
Pull up on the scene clean, stuntings in my genes
Must get it from my grand daddy, cuz daddy wasn't part of the team
I sip 'leen, walk wit a lean
Been all balanced out, when I started holding that thing
Introduce Star General and hear the ladies scream
Can pack a stadium from sixty to thirteen
And my pressure crack pipes like fiends (God damn)
And my flow crack mics like spleens (God damn)
Yeah I got a lover and her name ain't Billie Jean
I'm a 12 bar killer, fuck spitting 16

[Chorus 2X]

[Rubbabandz]
Pac said it best, money over bitches
Eyes on my paper, guns on the snitches
In the court house, telling police my business
As soon as he walks out, you know your man finished
Heat to his melon, screaming and yelling
Look at him take off, he got to be jelling
Looking like a track star, should of got a fast car
I'mma chase him down, send him to Allah
Then I'm off to the next state, setting up a gate
Stick a nigga for some weight, wait, get my paper straight
Fake niggas can't eat, hit the street, get the shank
Real niggas'll lay you down, and take cake

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
