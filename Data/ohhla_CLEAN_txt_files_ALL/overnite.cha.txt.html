[Chamillionaire]
Ain't do this overnight

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
Stay chasin payments, hard times done changed then
I can't be slavin nowwww - ain't do this overnight
I know you're thinkin
This life is really amaziiiing - ain't do this overniiiiight
Look at all the nonsense I've been through, so-called beef with you-know-who
Did it myself, why don't you? (Why don't you?) Ain't do this overnight
Don't expect help when it all fall through, everyone'll tell you it's all on you
Fight or run, what you gon' do? (What you gon' do?) Ain't do this overnight

[Chamillionaire]
Uh, everybody sayin that they want the life
But everybody thinkin that it's overnight
They say you wanna win then you know the price
Ain't do this overnight
Uh, have a little chick that was known to gripe
Early in the morn' I was on a flight
I don't really know if it was wrong or right
But I - ain't do this overnight
Always did it big way before the hype
I'm just tryin to live, let me roll the dice
Gotta be the boss, can I own my life?
Ain't do this overnight
You wanna tell me this shit for showin my type
My jewelry lookin like I just went on a heist
Garage full of SUV's and motorbikes
But see I always realized that it was more to life
Now it's back to this, I'm on rappin trips
Classy chicks that wanna have a kiss
When I was walkin in the mailbox, et cetera
with a stack of chips that ship packages
Had a bucket list to get a platinum wrist
Have platinum shift and get a platinum disc
Was a level I ain't really even have to hit
You wasn't there, you ain't even done half of this
And now they tellin me they really want the old school back
But where was you at when the old school act?
Got exposed to crack for the local rats 
who were laughin when they saw the tires go too flat
Tell my enemies that I was born to win
I bet you never go against the boy again
You a historian, go check the facts
I ain't goin back, keep your DeLorean

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire]
Lost a label then made a label
My partner tried to be Cain and Abel
Y'all see what sippin that Haterade do
Ain't do this overnight
They tryin to say, "You let money change you"
I wasn't never no perfect angel
But you lazy actin like you disabled
Ain't do this overnight
This decision is provin fatal
Time you spent away might decay you
I see myself in that XXL
and Source magazine on that coffee table
9-to-5 'til that job betray you
Playin your moves until they delay you
Most record companies hate to pay you
But your lawyer gotta get paid to save you
I'm worth the fee cause I don't work for free
There's no limit you would think purchase me
What works for them just don't work for me
So don't purchase one, just go purchase three
Now they say the game is in surgery
They need a doctor so they insert for me
I put on the gloves and insert the needle
Hope I'm executin this perfectly
Now I'm feelin like it's back to the basics (basics)
Feel like I'ma make it out "The Matrix" (Matrix)
Don't believe me just watch (just watch)
Can't see it then you better get LASEK
Make this money but I never let the money make me
Ay money, tell me what you done for me lately
See me and you ain't even cut from the same tree
Same cloth, I'm a boss, let 'em see in HD

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm not calling you Chamillionaire
Hakeem, I need you to call me back
I saw that Volkswagen commercial that had your song in it
I'm thinkin, why you ain't send me no compensation for that?
You was in MY crib the first day you heard a UGK CD
And that's what even led you to make the "Ridin' Dirty" song
So, technically, the inspiration for your whole career
was based off a true story, MY story
I made you, call me back
Or it's on sight when I see you, boy

[Chorus]</pre>
