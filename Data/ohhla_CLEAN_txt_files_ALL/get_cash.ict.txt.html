[Intro: Ice-T] 
Uhh, yeah, Ice-T
Check it out, players on the hill
Looking for a nutsack
Straight lace hustles in the house
WHAT!! - East and West
Shyheim is in the house
Shoaling, yeah, real players unite
Raw Breeze in the house, he is from Bronx, baby
It's going down, yeah, check it
 
[Verse One: Ice-T]                                
Pop the RÃ©my, kick back and let the player represents 
High floss, true boss came to take aim
These suckers wannabe-us they can please your green
I bend whores on a down low; banks obscene 
You wanna chill with these niggaz that you wish you could
And suck game out my ass like sponges, I run this
You can't fuck with my steelo; you niggaz born to be low
When I'm on the East I play Ceelo, cash flow
A one track mind, serial hustler
Quick to break a buster, you snitch bitch I dust ya
Bently balling bastard; no hustler faster
Game maker, I knock a white girl to break her
You can't see me motherfucker; your focus is off
You can't be me motherfucker; you're broke and soft
Too many niggaz trying to pert my lifestyle by romancing
I was kicking game and y'all kids was break-dancing
Overlord; so why the whack niggaz is fucking dead?
Probably because my aim is over nigga's heads
Eastcoast, Westcoast, I play the whole map and bounce
You got a Benz but you're living in you mamma's house
 
[Chorus:]
[Ice-T]   Damn, I'm just trying to..
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   Don't want no static, baby, just trying to get paid
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   Let's keep it moving, baby, let's keep it moving, baby
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   I don't want no static, kid, just trying to get paid, feel me?
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, I'm trying to get the loot
 
[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I kick back and bump the rap tapes lace
I turn out the lights, makes you stretching right
Yeah, I kicks back in the leather, gets my thoughts together
Listen to the emcees that kick it clever
Ill type flows and complicated vocal batter
Meticulous, verbal assaults and topic matter
The sence chills through my bones 
When I hear an MC rips a microphone, I got a rap Jones
But when he starts keep it game, he's my reign cousin
You thought I let slide by, real players knew I wasn't
I want to let you look into a magazine and dream 
the name a thousand damn designers, you ain't never motherfucking seen
One day, yes, one day, you might get it
But when I see you on the streets, kid, you look pathetic
I mass the street game when I was younger
Old hustlers said I got that true pimp hunger
That's why I got the mad street clout
And when you see me on the street I would be buttas no boubt
 
[Chorus: with minor variations]
[Ice-T]   You know what I'm doing though..
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   Don't want no greed, baby, just trying to get mine
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   Keep it moving, baby, keep it moving, kid, yeah, yeah..
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   You know what I do out there in the streets, yeah, yeah
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, I'm trying to get the loot
 
[Verse Three: Ice-T]
There's only one thing worse than a player hater, that's a player faker
Ain't never have been through nothing; you're fronting
Dear God; I can't imagine what it's like
to rap about a lifestyle that you ain't never lived in fucking life
VERSACE!! but you're barely got a fucking belt
LOS VAGUS!! and you ain't never wrote the fucking felt
Niggaz know the Ice is clean as treasuries plates
Whether mashing in the sex, or licking high for gates
My reputation is like bulletproof
Known to mash-by in the Limo' with hookers hanging out the roof
The gangster blueprints your work off, kid
What you're praying that you do, yo, I done already did
Never claimed to be the greatest rapper and I don't give a fuck
Only claimed to be a hustler, known how to check a buck
You'll wake up one day and realize; just because your skills can pay me
Your girls might not be paid, G, come back out to reality
You're broke as fuck, I know, you player-hate me
 
[Chorus: with minor variations]
[Ice-T]   All I'm just trying to do is..
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   That's right, baby, we keep it moving, baby, we keep it moving, baby
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   Just trying to get my cash on.. like you!
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   Straight hustler for life.. on the hill!
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   Yeah.. just trying to get mine
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   With my niggaz, for life, yeah
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot
[Ice-T]   You player-hate me, I'm just trying to get mine
[Shyheim] Trying to get my cash on, trying to get the loot</pre>
