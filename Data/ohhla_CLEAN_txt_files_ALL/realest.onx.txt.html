[Chorus: Onyx]
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest in here?!

[Verse One: Fredro Starr]
It's that time we about to lift off
Let off the ratchets, full metal jackets blow your head off backwards
Attack with, everything 
Get that mac 11 ring, like bill collectors
I'm a mass murderer that killed on records
With that fifry round drum, deal with diddy dumb dumbs
Every nigga on the run, in the city that I'm from
We catchin wreck on wreck through rush hour
You son't want niggas like us to get power
We rush cowards in the back, with crushed flowers
United we stand divided we fall
Hammers'll draw, man down man on the floor

[Chorus: Onyx]
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest in here?!

[Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz]
Checkin in on the 13th make me feel like a king
We wearin brass knuckles like a four finger ring
Got goons on deck to take one for the team
Stick you for everything nigga even your dreams
Wanna know who the illest take a look in my eyes
When you wake up with nothin, don't be surprised
Rather hate you for the truth, than love you for the lies 
I take you to the booth that's where everybody dies
There's so much dirt I get wet I still drip in mud
In the hood niggas grimey money thicker than blood
Get murked over pennies, nickels and dubs
I'm Bogartin the game we the illest niggas alive!

[Chorus: Onyx]
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the realest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest is it you?! (YEAH! YEAH!)
Who's the illest in here?!</pre>
