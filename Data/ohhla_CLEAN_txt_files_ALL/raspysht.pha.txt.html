Unh... A lil better.. Yep... Lil Skateboard P... haha
Yezzur (hot).. yezzur (hot).. yezzur (hot).. yezzur

[Verse 1]
Ma... the way you holdin on me it's a problem
The fuck you tryna end up in the gossip column
I know I got jewels like I'm the pharoah of the ghetto
But we are and it's a bright ass shiny Carerra
Stickin ya feet out the window so they can see ya stillettos
Cost a thousand dollars same as ya housing holla
Not to mention the wrist and the thirty thousand collar
Pussy must be good he's victim to ya power
Shit nigga like me I woud never allow it
Spit that shit to me I would ask you "have you showered?"
You wanna get up in my boat and ride
Take pictures wit the kid up in Ocean Drive
Go to Castatuas and sip on Calouas
At the bar talkin to other women about the best jewelers
You like that huh? Smilin still
Call ya girlfriend (why?) you fell asleep at the wheel

[Chorus]
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
*scratch* raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
*scratch* raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
*scratch* raspy shit
And don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit... c'mon

[Verse 2]
I walk in brashest certainly the crassest
The restaurant's classes the owner is asses
Shit my money green like the helmet of a fascist
So what you want-- Patron or Petrucia glasses?
Ain't no mystery his daughter know the history
And every night we toast like it's victory-- get wit me
And I ain't changed since my early mental
I been snackin on shrimp and sippin on Shirley Temples
No drug to drinkin-- what you want?
No seriously what you thinkin? Since the Yukon
Never puffed a J you can ask Loushawn
Back when he pushed beige like it was coupons
Wit a house full of dames like it was Moulin
I would ask they names but they would only do Shawn
And I ain't sayin they regret it but fuck it they do
Cuz if they could reverse time nigga what would they do? Huh?

[Chorus]
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
*scratch* raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
*scratch* raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
*scratch* raspy shit
And don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit... c'mon

[Verse 3]
Honeys Panamanian eyes like Iranian
Lighter than the blue of the sky of the day we in
Ass like a volleyball the kind that make ya dick hard
Head to the hustlers so sweet she could get cars
Now she here with me Lil Skateboard P
Cheaper than the sound of a bird that chirps
I spit then I hit then I murk-- yezzur
A flick chico stick and a twix that's her
She admire how the champion live
How I signed Slim Thug wit a ramp in my crib
I'm a champion I do as the champions did
Except I improve wit the new and the rest get rid
But some of y'all don't like that it's easy tryna bite back
Instead of sayin hi gettin fly but I'll be right back
My dude got the steel if you think you fly
Shoot the wings off ya ego and watch you skydive.. yezzur

[Chorus]
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
*scratch* raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
*scratch* raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
*scratch* raspy shit
And don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit... c'mon
