[sample]
The Rodent, his favorite diet is money

[Li-Mouse]
Keep bringing it, I'm sword swinging it
Those who oppose, start to believe in it
The richest sequence of battle tactics
Burns the weak like stomach lactic
Acids, gases, poison just passes
In through the ears, feel like blades of grasses
Li-Mouse attracts many, the masses
That contest, only form jackasses
If I die, revitalize the strength of Horus
I'm breaking niggas down, like a Ford Taurus
Florists can't manage to see the style's beauty
Most MC's is booty, their hip hop is their duty
Not me, nope, remain in my studi-
Oh, I mean, in my fucking study
Shape shifting and confuse in forms like silly putty

[Cno Evil]
Hold up, so stand back and just listen
To the bass on the track and the bells that be clicking
Feel the ticks and the tocks, fuck the licks and the shots
Construction in my blood, bring the bricks to the block, ugh
Rodentz, first time was just a test
No we burn like SoCo lime shots to your chest, ugh
Cno Evil, yes, rolling with the best, ugh
Keep rap alive til there is nothing left
White Plains, New York, I'm the lord
Lethal, evil weapons that you can't afford
And I swing on the track like Jose Reyes
My eyes in a haze, solar rays burn through shades
More mics to blow, more skills to show
More places to go, more stacks of dough
Mad bitches that blow, with asses that show
Not women, but hoes, relax, it's Cno

[Chorus 4X: Knickolist Knowledge]
More mics to blow, more skills to show
More places to go, more stacks of dough</pre>
