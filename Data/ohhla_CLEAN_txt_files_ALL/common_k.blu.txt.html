[Intro]
Fo' sho'. You know, we was talkin'
And we figured a lot of y'all motherfuckers love to skip steps
You know, y'all talk shit behind y'all soundscan. Cat's know man
I'm lookin' right now. (That was a keeper!) You know what I'm sayin'?
It's common knowledge man

[Verse One] [Blueprint]
This artform's been exploited like my mother Africa
For years by my peers but I'm here to bring it back to her
Caught up in the essence so they label me a backpacker
A little off base, but here's why it's accurate
+My Uzi Weighs A Ton+ 
Now ask yourself, "How else could he carry it?"
Plus he got the goodies for good times and merry men
Bring the party with him everywhere he is
I got lots of love for my boo that is
No love for them groupie dudes and stuck up chicks
And all them indie rock girls know what time it is
If they don't they better ask Flava Flav
And I make sure my sound checks sounds best
I air lines/airlines in America throughout the SouthWest
Yeah I'm grounded but I gotta sound fly
That way my rap career's never on standby

[Chorus] [x2]
[IP]One battle and you're through?
[BP] You're supposed to flow
[IP] You ain't tryin' to pay dues?
[BP] Like you supposed to blow
[IP] Keep droppin' the same album
[BP] You're supposed to grow
[IP] Everyday is a challenge
[BP] You're supposed to know

[Verse Two] [Ill Poetic]
Y'all fools rap and I'm an illusion
Rap Wolverine, Hugh Jackman
I jack humans
So if you average about, rappin' about 
Platinum clout, then I'll just try to average it out
And prove that you're hardly worthy
Bitch smack you harder than Charlie Murphy
Your verse is edible
Print and Ill Poetic will
Prove you just a silhouette of skill

[Blueprint]
Let's build

[Ill Poetic]
Y'all went from bathroom stalls to chat room walls
You went from record stores to message boards
We makin', records that'll get your chick movin' out her dresser drawers
Plus we killin' metaphors
So, when I rhyme
I gotta have a graph writer 
Draw an chalk outline around your Alpine
Now it's time
Treat the next rappers dick like a trampoline bitch
Use it to hop on mine
[Chorus] [x2]
[IP]One battle and you're through?
[BP] You're supposed to flow
[IP] You ain't tryin' to pay dues?
[BP] Like you supposed to blow
[IP] Keep droppin' the same album
[BP] You're supposed to grow
[IP] Everyday is a challenge
[BP] You're supposed to know</pre>
