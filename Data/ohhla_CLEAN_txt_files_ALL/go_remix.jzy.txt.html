[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
First I buss-a-right, then I buss-a-left (G'yeah!)
Music so loud I almost went deaf (Talk to em, hommie.. Deammn!)
Hit the sweet once and then I hold my breath
Smoke every cigarello 'till it ain't none left
Got 50 in the clip, 20 grand in my pocket (Yuh!)
Money so big, Ionn even need a wallet (Ha-ha!)
72' impala same color as the pills (Woo!)
Red, white and blue - the same colla as the bills (Let's go!)
Here we go again, it's the mothafuckin' remix
Whole car smoked up, now I can't see shit (Nahh!)
Heater on my waste, got the sac in the back
Got the whole Escalade smellin' like the pack (Yuh!)
GO GETT'EM BITCH!!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Bun B]
I'm in the triple black convertable GT Bentley
Trill UnderGroundKing, got the Queen right wit me (Yup!)
And things right wit me, and dat thang right on me
I'm a one-stop-shop and a one man army, wit the F3000 and the F350
Seven send you to heaver fo' bein' so shifty
We work up on the triple beam and wait on the 4 way
I hit the highway, ya way pimpin' wit my yay - there's no way
Dat anybody the scope you and {??} to holla at the effey
These streets have me codin' zones these more sessay
My seven jizzy james and Pimp C is my friend, so
You can take dat to the grave or the bank

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Jadakiss]
Unhh!.. Unhh!.. Yo!
Niggas is too frail, you either a snake or a new snail
My heart as cold as the new jail
Everywhere I go they beggin' me
But 1 wrong decision can destroy ya legacy (Unh!)
Lemme see I can break 'em down and take longer to slow sail (Uh huh!)
Im'a chill fo' a minute - sit on 'em and hoe sail 'em
Buisness is just fine, none of ya folks tellin' (Unh!)
Shouldn't have it any other way when you coke sellin'
I don't know wha it is, I guess we was raised different (Yeah!)
Blowin' hayes standin' on the couch Roseye drippin' (Haha)
Air forces, hard {??}, my lofe sweater
D-Block, ya boy 'Kiss is a go getta
