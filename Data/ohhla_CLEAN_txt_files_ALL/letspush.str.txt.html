Album:  Original Pirate Material
Song:   Let's Push Things Forward
Typed by: aloevera@arcticmail.com

This ain't the down, it's the upbeat, make it complete
So what's the story, guaranteed accuracy, enhanced CD
Latest technology, darts at treble twenty
Huge non-recoupable advance, majors be vigilant
I excel in both content and deliverance
So let's put on our classics and we'll have a little dance, shall we?
No sales pitch, no media hype
No hydro, it's nice and ripe
I speak in communications in bold type
This ain't your archetypal street sound
Scan for ultrasound
North, South, East, West and all round
And then to the Underground

[Chorus x2]
You say that everything sounds the same
And then you go buy them
There's no excuses, my friend
Let's push things forward

As we progress to the check point
I wholeheartedly agree with your viewpoint
But this ain't your typical garage joint
I make points which hold significance
That ain't a bag it's a shipment
This ain't a track, it's a movement, I got the settlement
My frequencies are transient and resonate your eardrums
I make bangers not anthems, leave that to the Artful Dodger
The broad shouldered fifty-one percent shareholder
You won't find us on Alta Vista
Cult classic not bestseller, you're gonna need more power
Plug in the free phase and the generator, crank it up to gigawatts
Critics, ready with your pot shots, the plot thickens
Put on your mittens for these sub zero conditions
But remember I'm just spitting, remember I'm just spitting
Once bitten, forever smitten

[Chorus]

Spit jewels like Eastern riches, junkie fixes
Around here we say 'birds', not bitches
As London Bridge burns down Brixton's burning up
Turns out your in luck, I knows this dodgy fuck in the Duck
So it's just another show flick for your local city poet
In case you geezers don't know it, let's push things forward
It's a tall order but we're taller, calling all maulers
Back street brawlers, corner shop crawlers, victory's flawless
Love us or hates us but don't slate us
Don't conform to formulas, pop genres and such
Sharp darts, double dutch, parked cars troubles you much
With more bud - let's. push. things. forward

[Chorus]</pre>
