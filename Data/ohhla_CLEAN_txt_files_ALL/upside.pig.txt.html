Freak freak y'all, can I speak y'all?
I'm feeling you so much I really wanna reach all
Whether short or tall skater
Or be a basketball player
Or a geek hiding in the bathroom stall
I really love y'all, do you love me?
Then why do we connect and redefine ecstasy?
It's not a pill y'all, it's not a thrill y'all
It's not a video buddy, it's what you feel y'all
Cause we gon' die soon, and we gon' be forgot
If we don't find out why were here and what's the main plot
It's so confusing, it's so eluding
My name is Pigeon John I'm here to make it soothing
Cause times get hard, and girls get scarred
That's why they not feelin' you and you're feelin' cold bars
And the men too, they don't speak to the kids
And the kids become sid and ? instead

[Chorus]
Pigeon Juan will turn it upside down
'bout to turn this party upside down
Me and you and your crew will take over the town
Cause we 'bout to turn this party upside down
Pigeon Juan will turn it upside down
'bout to turn this party upside down
Me and you and your crew will take over the town
Cause we 'bout to turn this party upside down
Freak freak y'all, seek seek y'all
No matter if the wind blows it makes you fall
There's always time to, redefine you
Don't think it's too late, the past is behind you
I use to drink Baccardi and go to strip clubs
And now I... still wanna go to strip clubs
See I'm like you, I'm just like you
I wanna grow but the cost is too much to
But now times up, I gotta drop that
I'm talking about me not you behind your back
I like to walk alone, dark black streets
That's where I find God chillin' in the back seat
I say, "I'm sorry", he says, "Don't worry
Follow my lead never be in a hurry"
I say, "I'm sorry", he says, "Don't worry
Follow my lead never be in a hurry"

[Chorus]
Pigeon Juan will turn it upside down
'bout to turn this party upside down
Me and you and your crew will take over the town
Cause we 'bout to turn this party upside down
Pigeon Juan will turn it upside down
'bout to turn this party upside down
Me and you and your crew will take over the town
Cause we 'bout to turn this party upside down

Upside down, upside down, upside down..
