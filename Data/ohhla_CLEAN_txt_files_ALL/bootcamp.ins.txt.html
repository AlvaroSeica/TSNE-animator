[Insane]
Here's a little somethin' 'bout a nigga like me
Never should've been, let out the penitentiary
Insane, would like to say, that I'm a crazy motherfucker sippin' alize'
Since I was a youth, I smoke weed out, the weed make me bring the fuckin' 17 out
Takin' a life or two, that's what the hell I do
You other niggaz claimin' Camp, nigga fuck you
This is a game, and I'm in it, my nigga Lipp'll fuck you up in a minute
Wit' a right, left, right, left, you're toothless
And make 'em say "man them niggaz always gotta ruin shit"
Everywhere we go they say what, that Boot Camp Clicc just don't give a fuck
And when they realize we don't care, we don't just say no
We too busy sayin' yeah, about drinkin', straight out the 'ze bottle
Do I look like a motherfuckin' role model, to a kid lookin' up to me
For life this is Camp, and I'm all about my money

[Chorus]
'Cuz I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Ya disrespect the Camp, ya get a slug in yo' ass
And I don't give a fuck cuz I'll keep yellin'
Yo, tell me what the fuck are they yellin'

[4x]
Boot Camp gangsta, Boot, Boot, Boot Camp gangsta
That's what they yellin'

[Insane]
Niggaz all standin' around just hangin', some dope dealin', some gangbangin'
We decide to roll and we deep, look at this nigga, man Precise tryna' creep
Real slow, and before ya know, I had that AK pointed in the window
He got scared, and tried to dash, right then we started dumpin' on his ass
We kept rollin', we bustin' at his cutlass, we couldn't catch him so I said fuck it
Now we headed right back to the 'Grove, sweatin' all the bitches in the tight ass clothes
We didn't get no play, from the bitches, with 6 niggaz, caravan, and hittin' switches
She was scared, and it was showin', we all said "Boot Camp Clicc", and kept goin'
To the hood, the click been true, this is just some shit that we done been through
Like some pussy, or in fact, keepin' niggaz in line when they be tryin' to jack
A young nigga all about my pay, Insane'll get dumb off that alize'
I might stumble, but still won't lose, the boot got my back, the Camp nuttin' but trues

[Chorus]
'Cuz I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Ya disrespect the Camp, ya get a slug in yo ass
And I don't give a fuck, 'cuz I'll keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'

[G-Slimm and (Precise) talking]
Hold on, wait a minute 'Cise, stop that shit (alright then)
Fuck that, let's go back nigga (how far back?)
All the way back nigga (and it goes a lil' somethin' like this)

[G-Slimm]
Here's a little gangsta, short in size, a t-shirt and karl kani's is his only disguise
Built like a tank yet hard to hit, Insane and Lil' Lipp from the Boot Camp Clicc

[Lil' Lipp (Insane)]
Well I'm Lil' Lipp, the one they talkin' about, stayin' true, bangin' boot, representin' the south
One time's tryna' roll, so its time to play, I creep the way real slow
And hop in the 6 trey, with the
(Tecs in the back, boomin' up the block
Reachin' for his glock, 'bout to make the hood hot)
It's the Lipp, you know I rap, slang, and bang
I'm just fuckin' dog hoes like it ain't no thang
Yeah bitches, you know I'm talkin' to you
We wanna fuck you Lipp, you gotta fuck my crew
So you see, we really don't take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who ya fuckin' wit'

[Chorus]
