[Intro]
You know these big mouth niggaz don't know how to act
I got my West coast connection
These dead in the street industry motherfuckers
talkin 'bout "we can't eat" talkin 'bout "we brand new guys"
Y'all niggaz suck a dick~!

[A$AP Rocky]
I'm camou' down to my boxers, gold teeth, a Bathing Ape
It's animals in my projects, like monkeys, orangutans
Banana clip on that chopper, I hold heat, bangers bang
Let Chiquita speak - bet it keep the peace, that Lil B, brrrangadang
I don't care if you blue or you red flaggin, hair swingin, my pants saggin
Hoes all on my bandwagon, your bitch gaggin, she jetlaggin
All my cuz niggaz, what's crackin? All my blood niggas, what's poppin?
I ain't set trippin, I just happen to know who click clackin, you mismatchin
Fuck swagger, you been jackin, fuck fly, I am fashion
Tryin to cop that Benz wagon, my bitch drive it and my friends crash it
Niggaz threat with the chit-chattin, see a nigga don't shit happen
I'm finna blow on that Bin Laden, so talk money, pig latin
(Suck my fuckin dick, bitch)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Brand new clip, brand new nine
Brand new bitch, brand new ride
Brand new weed, brand new high
Brand new me meet the brand new guys

[ScHoolboy Q]
Three-fo'-five be the big toy, now which nigga want it with the fat boy?
Uhh - I'm clipped up like I'm paranoid, high as hell nigga, Fitzroy
Pull it off through the city like skirt
Seen that ho nigga like errr, hopped up on a nigga like murk
Put that pussy nigga in a purse
You wouldn't be the first, cover him with dirt
Put him in the ground, he was down to earth
Knocked up nigga, I been down since birth
Backpack full of random work
with two bad hoes I'll teach you how to jerk
Teach you how to jerk, swaggin in my J's
Pop me a pill and throw that pussy a rave
(Pussy a rave) My prerogative weighs
Nappy chin hairs with the brand new fade
Brand new nigga with a brand new venue
Sold that bitch out shoulda made that hoe bigger
Killing careers make these cupcakes remember
My objective is to serve your agenda
Biggie and Nas put they ass in a blender
Sprinkle some 50 and came out this nigga
Equipped with a gat and the dick in your mouth
Balls in my hands and your bitch in my house
Twistin up weed, I'm diggin her out
Just fillin her out
Do all that shit you be talkin about
While you gone? Shit, Netflix on your couch
What this popcorn about?
Microwave oven while you out there cuffin
You over there lovin
That bitch be my stuffing, like
Like we really be fuckin

[Chorus]

[ScHoolboy Q] + (ASAP Rocky)
Brand new shirt to the brand new drawers
Brand new socks to the brand new Glock (uh-huh)
This muh'fucker hold fifteen
Slap that hoe in, tell the clip get lost (nigga fuck you)
Bitch I'm a boss
Pulled up clean, don't you hear the exhaust (uhh)
Got my tie on, grippin on my i-ron, who I'm 'bout to fire on?
(Rap game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I rap for?)
(Crack game fucked up, boy, fuck you think I trap for?)
(Riding round with that mask on)
(Like a Mac attack when that strap on)
(Like a Shaq attack on that backboard, clap on, clap off)
Blue pit in my back yard (red nose my bad broad)
Titan full of that hydro (pretty nigga, no catwalk)
Big burner in your big mouth (pussy niggaz suck led off)
I pull it up then skirt off
Vodka shots, he Smirnoff
(40 ounce of that Cristal)
(Rose, that Rick Ross)
Got it jumping like Kriss Kross
(Mishmatching, no Jigsaw)
No horseplay when we quick draw
(Pussy nigga get a tit job)
Hands up, stick your mans up
Your time's up, the new brand's up
