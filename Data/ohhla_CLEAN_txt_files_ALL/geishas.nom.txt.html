[Verse 1]
Attitude
Kin of the Maasai
With the spirit of a samurai
Coincide with organic elements till I'm fortified
The horror lies in some joints
I explore the high points
Stratosphere
Others try to fly but I'm the baddest here
Battle gear
Shield, helmet, sword like the Lord
Floored by the beauty while I soar
Nihon the name sounds like a poem
Roam for research
Even if my feet hurt
Still step and quiet kept
Met energies befriending me
Envy never meant to be
It started last century
With thought, never discouraging
Landscapes that are flourishing with cherry blossom winds
Fond of Koi ponds, watch the day as it begins
Watch the night before it bends
Boomerang effect return for what's next and mic checks
Flex a muscle through the hustle rustle feathers get the pay
Meanwhile, beauty bombs this place
GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

[Chorus]
A classic feel generates the seal
Nuff respect to staying real cause... GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

Used to keep bonds &amp; complete charms
In the city and the farm you know... GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

Hold that spot, respect is all I got
So hear the story as I talk about... GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

Ancient times combined with the new
Obliged to stay true like...

[Verse 2]
Abstract
Electronic settings
Betting on reality
Commonly placed on the edge minus the casualties
Calligraphy takes shapes that make me understand
I'm the centerpiece artist in God's Great Plan
From Cali to Japan respect High demands
Cause I'm a centerpiece motif a broad mind span
Fan fire
My desire used to be like Rick's
Fixed upon the lips that dangle configure the angle and try
So high
Feel as if the sun rise
When I pass by Fuji-san on the Shinkan
Energy that merges through my meditation
Spiritual alliance feeling liberation
Random points of interest
Intensive like a mistress that's loved from the side
How could you ever miss this?
Inconclusive
No excuses for this super producer
Kirei, bombs away
Like GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

[Chorus]
A classic feel generates the seal
Nuff respect to staying real cause...GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

Used to keep bonds &amp; complete charms
In the city and the farm you know... GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

Hold that spot, respect is all I got
So hear the story as I talk about... GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

Ancient times combined with the new
Obliged to stay true like...

[Verse 3]
Addiction
Never front on fiction
Historical values
Life retaining secrets
As I go compile clues
Use it to my benefit
I've really gotten into it
Illest in my younger days
Magnifying solar rays
Displays of self-control
Target mind, body &amp; soul
Bringing new to the old
Peoples know how I roll
Like Black folks, soul seems to overflow in this place
My Mac Pro glows at the shows performing with grace
Take a taste of a basic way of life
A basic way of giving to a true form of living
Negativity sparks the bark but will never catch
It's a shame, especially when flames versus rain
Tamed society still sole propriety
Mushrooms die but the high will never lie
May the title be claimed at the end of the day
Hagakure I say y'all
GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

[Chorus]
A classic feel generates the seal
Nuff respect to staying real cause...GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

Used to keep bonds &amp; complete charms
In the city and the farm you know... GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

Hold that spot, respect is all I got
So hear the story as I talk about... GEISHAS IN THE DAYS

Ancient times combined with the new
Obliged to stay true like...</pre>
