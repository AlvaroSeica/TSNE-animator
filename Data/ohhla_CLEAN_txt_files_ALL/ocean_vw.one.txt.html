[Zack de la Rocha]
Uhh...
Blood done been runnin down streets flood with beats
of pepper spray over cracked concrete, so
So vicious make a rich man's neck split
Underworld 'bout to wreck shit, bet this
Banks closed, stomachs churnin
Lines and rows, cops blastin out church windows
They heard word of two, on the terror list
Hid in the pews just two city terrace kids
One held a piece just for peace of mind
The other was spittin poems blowin minds on q picket line
Barricades lay 'cross, made with bumpers and burnin tires
And you could smell the exhaust
And you could hear the kids scream don't play us too close
Have the mic or the heater, but you can't hold both
And they were both...
And they were both...

[Chorus]
Ocean of tears rise
Rise a flame to tear them down
Ocean of past crimes now
Fill our hearts to tear them down

[Zack de la Rocha]
The water main's cut off, panic hit the manor of the mayor who's soft
Word on the streets that the cops got off
They shook to rhythm of, heaters
that burned like claps of thunder, you turn to look
at vengeance returned, that shattered control, after the whole
shock of the news that a bomb hit the bridge at Broadway
Gridlock, full stop, every exit way
From Chavez to Main, downtown was the same
Every corner aflame with, lines of people stripped of they clothes, freeze~!
Hold up your ID's, their houses burned as they watched
The colonel looked at his clock and they were all
And they were all...
And they were all...

[Chorus] - 2X

[repeat 6X]
We'll light the flame... to tear them down!!

[Outro]
TO TEAR THEM DOWN!! TO TEAR THEM DOWN!!</pre>
