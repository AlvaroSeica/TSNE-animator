[Judge]
All rise! Professor Griff
make your opening statements, boooy

[Professor Griff]
Thank you very much, your Honor
I charge the United States government with being
the number one murderers on the Earth!
I charge the United States government with being
the number one deceivers, liars, kidnappers, thieves on the Earth!
I say America should go to a rap show and let me uhhh...

[Verse 1: Last Asiatic Disciple]

Souls were stole and they try to intimidate us
But it's a fact that being black try to segregate us
Just like pawns, manoeuvred on a chess game
They were surprised when Professor Griff came
And took a stand with the upper hand
Gained respect and understood by the other man
So now you say, 'Who is really on trial?'
There's fuckin' racism on every dial
Portrayed on the tube, I'm not wildin'
As a wannabe, you see
From L.A.D., the jury you heard it
Pay attention, back to The Verdict

[Verse 2: Last Asiatic Disciple]

Guilty! How low can you get?
The mothafuckin' president just got a death threat
Because he's stickin' his nose in other people's affair
He doesn't care, that's why they wanna take him outta here
Guilty, because of the simple reason
(What reason? What reason?)
He's in charge, and to the fact that he's the president
But 95 percent of the time he's at his residence
Guilty, press conference after conference after conference
Still not a damn thing gets accomplished
Guilty is The Verdict, but some labels would not let me talk
That's why I choose to Sky-walk

(Man, a man can't do nothing no more! ahh haha haha)
(Guilty)

[Verse 3: Professor Griff]

From a radical mind comes radical production
Political system geared for our destruction
Country is ran and controlled by lames
The code word bred to keep your mind in chains
I still drop knowledge for listeners and readers
While government hitmen stalk black leaders
In God's house you shine, you glitter
You sell your soul to the highest bidder
Don't be fooled by the shit they're poppin'
The finest of drugs they claim to be stoppin'
These never accused, warned or even popped
The C-O-P that makes drops to the cops
Political villains take pay-offs every day
Some white, some black, some straight, some gay

(Gonna pull the sheet off of you)

[Last Asiatic Disciples in unison]
In God we trust you told us
In ships and chains you brought us
Halls of justice you call it
The judge and jury bullshit

[Speech]
There's not one of us here who doesn't want freedom
There's not one of us here who does not want justice and equality
There's not one of us here who doesn't want to see the black man
Lifted up from the mud of white civilization

[Verse 4: Last Asiatic Disciple]

Searchin' and searchin' as if this was hide-and-seek
So now ya know that I have the right to speak
Racism is still part of United Faith of America
OK, now here's some motherfuckin' truth for ya
Order in the court, order in the courtyard
First name to stand out like the man known as Malcolm
Your leader was afraid of playin' me
I'm the jury and judge and I won't be budgin' so just fear me
Last to deny anyone, so hit the bull's eye
Livin' it up, some givin' it up, point blank enough
Too much, too many, too little, too late
Arrivin' when I'm thrivin', nationally I'm attackin'
Our brothers and sisters knowin' what we're showin'
Injectin' law and order in your brain, you were slackin'
Before time had passed from a lyrical filth
But still the kill, and crime gets the big bill
Once more I step to the book for a good look
A lesson so critical, striking with the right hook
To be or not to be, justice in with the jury
The Verdict is death, it's in the Bible
I know you hear me
Fuck that hear-ye hear-ye, as you heard it
Meanwhile I'm the X and now back to The Verdict

[Verse 5: Last Asiatic Disciple]

I'm guilty! So what the fuck
I'm stuck between a wall and a Mack Truck
Slam on the brake 'cuz I may not a fade or mistake
I won't budge, so you be the judge
Of whether you hit me, it don't mean shit to me
Cuz I don't give a damn, can't you understand
If I'm guilty, then charge me only on
Expressin' my feelings through my song
If you lock me up and captivate me
I'll have to activate the L.A.D.
Police who try to make an arrest
Better watch they backs for the A.D.S.
Handcuffs could never contain
Like a pre-production or gold black chain
So I charge you on a count of bullshit
A-yo guilty is The Verdict
