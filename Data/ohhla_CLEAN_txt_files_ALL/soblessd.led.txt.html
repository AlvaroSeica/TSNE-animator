[Intro: T-Pain]
Can nothin stop me now
Yeah (DJ Khaled)
Yeah, ohohoo, no

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Man I'm so blessed (man I'm so blessed)
I got the Lord on my shoulders
I'm alright (I'm alright) I'm alright (I'm alright)
Ain't got no stress (ain't got no stress)
My people with me they celebratin the life
We livin life (we livin life)
Now sing it with me
If you've been workin hard, if you believe in God
Sing it with me
Can't nothin stop me now

[Big Sean]
Yeah yellin fuck a nine to five boi
Even if I gotta work from nine to nine boi
I'm self made, self paid and I got my city watchin
They threw me in the game, I threw up numbers like a auction
Cause I do it, do it, do it like it's no other option
Fat asses, big bottles, when I'm around they both get poppin
Pop pop pop I talk about girls and money too much I admit
Wait too much girls, too much money, those two things that don't exist
And I think it's so impressive, I'm ridin in the back
Young and black cause I'm chauffeured and not cause I'm arrested
Getting richer e'ry year, progress in my progression
Got the finest with her shirt off and skirt off showin her blessings

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
I wonder what the haters got to say now
They mad I'm on top of my game and they down
I'm always reppin for my gang I stay down
Ain't gotta go back to my hood cause they 'round
And the niggaz that's next to me it's all the niggaz that stress with me
I done made it from the bottom and they say I did it on my own, so to me that's destiny
If anybody got a problem I just tell 'em to get on their grind
try to to see as much checks as me
And my wife is a Goddess my tree is the finest
A click full of real niggaz that's just the one thing about us
One thing about us
They showin us love, but I remember back then them niggaz would doubt us
We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us
They screamin my name, I'm reppin my city it's me who they proud of
So fuck what the lames about
Wouldn't me no game without us
No game without us

[Chorus]

[Ace Hood]
Been hated on, I been doubted, been talked about and mistreated
Still put in the work that I needed, now I'm livin the things that I'm dreamin
Got my momma straight and my daughter good
and my team right cause we eatin
Been broke before, and now it's open doors
I got the dopest flow and they seen it
God keep away all them demons, been patient dog I've been lenient
Been holding out I've been fiendin, long as God with me I don't need 'em
When you winnin everybody want a dap up
Gettin money now your friends wanna act up
I don't really give a fuck I'ma go hard
No stress, couple cars in the front yard
We the Best be the logo, gettin money with a mogul
Upgrade from the 2 to the 4-do', top down so blast it, it's YOLO
One time for my XO, Ace Hood got these rap niggaz petrol
Fire, no lie nigga they know
From the bottom to the top only Lord knows

[Chorus]</pre>
