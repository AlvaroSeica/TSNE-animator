Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
Money, power, respect, that's all a nigga know
I got junkies at my door, I sell a lot of coke
So much dope, so much coke, trapping can't get old
It's that real trap music, man don't get exposed

[Verse 1]
All these fufu ass niggas
Man, just move around!
If staining up was a sport
I would be up, God damn!
We ain't wifing these hoes, cause we don't give a damn!
Getting money was a sport, I would be up some fam
Better stay up in your lane cause we don't give a damn!
My youngins with the shits, bitch we don't give a damn
I say this 30 that I'm blowing it'll lay em down
I keep my circle close cause I don't fuck around

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm the real trap nigga, you can see it in my eye
 I got weight, lot of grams, and I still selling bags
I need a new connect, cause his prices' getting high
Threw some Bandz out at the factory, I'm just trying to get it back
Get it back, get it back, hit the trap
I get it back I got workers in the back
and they're pushing all these packs
God damn, God damn, I'm the man, girlfriend
Suck my dick, suck my dick, bitch, you gotta do my man!
Any stains any Licks, you know I need ends
Kick the dough, lay you down, split the profit with my man's
Aye Fredo you know, we getting it in!
split the profit with my man's

[Chorus]</pre>
