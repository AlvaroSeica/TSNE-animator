[Intro: Masta Killa]
Shit... thank you, thank you, thank you
Yeah, you see, when I think about soul music
There's a few people that I would like to mention
Brothers and sisters, solo or group
That had an effect on my life
I would like to begin by showing my utmost respect and love
To my universal soul sisters, beautiful sisters like
Chaka Khan, Aretha Franklin, Miss Millie Jackson
Patti LaBelle, Miss Betty White, Glady Knight
Tina Marie, and Miss Mary J. Blige
Soulful groups like, Isley Brothers, Blue Birth, Blue Magic
The O'Jays, Emotions, Rolls Royce, The Delfonics, Parliament, and the Jackson 5
Now, we gon' move on to my soul brothers
Soul brothers like, brother Barry White, Isaac Hayes, Curtis Mayfield
James Brown, Mr. Stevie Wonder, Al Green, Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye
The legendary Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, Rick James, bitch, and my man R. Kelly
Now when it comes to the soul, there's one more brother in particular
That I have to mention, and he just happens to be my brother Ason Unique
Known to the world as the Ol' Dirty Bastard
See if RZA would of threw some shit like this on
He would of went crazy and probably said something ill type
He would of probably said...

[Masta Killa]
My beats slamming from the rugged programming
The man Bob Marley, hey my man, I'm jammin'
You can never test my stamina, while I'm ramming the
Hip hop crowd, make me rah rah rah
Other MC's got flipped with the ease, begging me for mercy, God, stop the music please
No, cuz I'm a pro, back to the convo, make the crowd say ho, at a strip show
Represent, his name is Ason, keep calm
Rhyme come smokey, funky like a stink bomb
Boom, blowing up niggas, mad bullets in the trigger
So you better run for cover!
Niggas got loose in they ass, felt the glass
A full account sprout, yo, yo, yo, money, yo pass
Woo, woo, woo, hospitalized
Is he gonna live Doc? No, the nigga dies
Maximum those MC's populating
Minimum those MC's I'm dominating
So all in together now, who, what, what, who
Rhyme come stinky like a girl poo

[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Hippa to the hoppa and you just don't stoppa
Hippa to the hoppa and you just don't stoppa
Hippa to the hoppa and you just don't stoppa
Hippa to the hoppa and you just don't stoppa

[Outro: Masta Killa]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you already
Aiyo, special love and dedication shout to Mama Cherry, we love you
Popa Wu, Brooklyn Zu, we already
12 O'Clock, 60 Sec., Murdock, Shit, Buddha Monk
Zu Ninjaz, and all the seeds, there seeds, whole family, man
You know it don't stop, stop, yeah
Yeah...</pre>
