ying yang in this thang  (ying yang) 

[Kaine]
Let me see ya make that pussy fart, good Lord
Make it shake like a salt shaker, too hard
Get it up 'till you can't ugh, no mo'
See I love when you hoes take it to tha floor
Baby bounce biggy bounce ugh, it's on you
Shorty you can twurk in your skirt, if you want to
See we came to keep it crunk for ya, all night
Put a dub  in da club show me, what I like

[D-Roc]
Freak bitch make money in da club
Them hoes like to take it off for a thug 
You can't come wit nuthin less than a dub
Or she lookin at yo ass like a scrub
Them hoes like it when a nigga em love
And she'll show you what she really made of
I guarantee yo ass wouldn't get enough
Tell her pop that shit, drop that shit, "WHAT"

Chorus: 2x

[D-Roc]
Where them hoes that's buying me a ticket
I thank they all dance at club nikki
Now where them hoes who be spittin that game
I thank they all dance at tha blue flame
Where them hoes that be hard booty shakin
I thank they all dance at tha foxxy lady

[Kaine]
I know she a shakin booty hoe no teaser

Now where them bitches that be quick to show them titties
I thank they all dance at tha magic city
I know some hoe that be quick to take over
You got tha green on your scene and strokers
 
[D-Roc]
And, where them hoes who be 'bout that cheese
I thank they all dance at (?)
And where them hoes who'll make that pussy clap

[Kaine]
Say them niggaz in tha club wanna hate 
Wanna touch her pussy and never wanna pay 
I said shouty fuck that nigga do your thang 
I see your crunk tiger stripe G- strang
It's bout that dollar bill then pepermint 
See them hoes represent for their rent.

[D-Roc]
If you in a booty club and you get your money spent 
And baby mama now she wonder where it went.

Chorus: 2x

[D-Roc]
Some of these bitches be real, they hard knock 
Once you get em crunck they start, they want stop 
Hoes get naked for cheese, they love that 
Take tha baddest bitch in tha club, I fucked that 
Some these bitches been crunk since first day 
Some of these bitches in tha club, they don't play 
Half these bitches who shake it, they turn gay 
Niggaz gone pay to see pussy, anyway (ahh,ahh)

[Kaine]
Some of these niggaz be walkin tha thin line
Fuckin wit these hoes wit no clothes and no mind
Baby girl out to get money she gone shine 
Everyday of work she gone be there on time 
Her pussy poppin shouty be sweatin like she noid 
Kinda like tha way that thang beat like a heart 
Turn around yeah that's it, good lord 
Tryin to do a chinese split and make it fart.

[D-Roc]
("ying yang in this thang" in the background at 
the beginning of each line)

Ying Yang in this thang, from the A-T-eeL
Whistle while you twurk if you really real
(?) in tha club smelling like some wood
(?) in my neighborhood
Girls get crunk in the piz ball
If you sit down, get up off tha wall
Males only speak, if the females flirt
If you get crunk, whistle while you twurk

Chorus: 4x</pre>
