since I was 17 I've been a legend in texas
screaming fuck the police and blowing dough in the lexus
I saw your video nigga, you're slow and sloppy
spent 500,000 on a carbon copy
while I was smoking with the young soldiers in the caddy

i'm a OG rock baller
I know some nigga that a bust 17 off in your impala

I'm still down with lil J I gotta the money and the fucking power

[verse 2]

niggas who ain't scared to put 6 in your Hilfiger

gold diggers for cheese jealous and in keys keeping berretas
for them playing hating fellas what the fuck can you tell us
driving benzs with mo mos hoes sucking our toes
cause they know we the niggas roll with all the goddamn dough

the early bird gets the bread if you snooze you lose
