[Intro: La the Darkman]
Yeah... I'd like to welcome you
to the Marvelous Adventures of S.S.R.

[La the Darkman]
I watch snakes as they try to get close to me
Chop their head off, put it where it's supposed to be
In a plastic bag, like groceries
Have ya casket surrounded by rosary
Fake gangsta, I'ma expose ya G
Send ya record label into foreclosure, B
That just make more room for my company
Named The Embassy, you ain't friend to we
Sing Sing/La Familia, we family
Right there on our hips where the hammers be
While bang ya, won't let no cameras see
Most killings get done in privacy
Without a patch on my eye still a pirate, see?
Keep a cannon and a knife in case I have to take a life
When the coke turn to oil I'ma hit with the ice
And the yae's so pure I don't have to hit it twice

[Chorus x2: La the Darkman]
This Sing Sing Regime we gon' make a mil
Get the world high like they all swallowed a pill
Gettin' money so you know I threw diamonds in my grill
Keep a 4x4 wheel without a record deal

[Willie the Kid]
Aiyo niggaz try and pull a fast one on the team
I put you in a full body cast with the sling
Forty cal mag put a gash in ya spleen
Respect Gun Rule, Sing Sing the Regime
Nigga you a bitch, you could pass for a queen
The first one to split, you the last on the scene
Willie so clean, cop a Jag for the spring
Willie so green, with the hash for the bling
Money got real when I graduated college
I did everything, still kept the flow solid
If rap was a house, I kept the floor polished
I bubble like soap, Cascade, Palmolive
Cuz when you this good, it's hard bein' modest
The Prince of the hood sippin' drinks with the olive
Homes in the Aspens, million dollar cottage
Me and Big Joe, Sean Combs, Chris Wallace
Me and Lason, King Kong, Godzilla
A .357, yeah the odds get realer
Good against this? I wouldn't recommend it
I'm real in the field with the skill, you pretended
It's not a scrimmage, it's more like a championship
I get money like a champion gets
The crowned Prince...

[Outro: Willie the Kid]
The Come Up Boys, Sing Sing Regime
Motherfuckers...</pre>
