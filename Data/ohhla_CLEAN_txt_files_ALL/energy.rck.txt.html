[Intro: J-Boo]
Yeah, DV, Rocks The World, what, yeah, ayo Tyce let them know the deal

[N-Tyce]
I beg your pardon
I'm like a two way, in order to work, I'm charging
More money for your bargain
I gotta eat now, look at me, shoot, I'm an anorexic starving
It's like a re-run, I already know what's happening
You paged your way in rapping to reach platinum
And you ain't really hot though
Matter fact, when it comes to hot, you not so, your whole block know
If they don't I'ma tell, cus I'm a tattle tale
Lyrically, we can take it to the battlefield
And you don't really want that, you got a reputation
But forget me, you only second placing
So hot in the streets feds investigating
Me need to rock over beats, heads is steady waiting
And I'm give them what they looking for
You better look, you know, bet ya'll know who shoulda shook ya

[Chorus 2X: N-Tyce]
Ya'll feel the energy, exploding
Cock back, we reloading
Heat holding, never gon leave till we swollen
Thats how it be when we rollin

[J-Boo]
Yo I get gully, spit thug all day
Spaz out, rip mics cus this thug don't play
I stay on my grind, getting the dough
If ya album did two, then I'm trying to do four
Straight bannanas, my crew be off the chain
Pretty thug still standing so remember the name
Deadly, yeah, we stay shaking them down
Like them rocks in the hood, we stay breaking it down
And on the blocks is where we stay holding the heat
You know the code baby, never go against the streets
Hood dreams, ghetto stars and hood fiends
It's anything goes in the hood for hood cream
Nah mean, so I gotta roll like this
Feel the heat everytime I flow like this
So cock back and explode (it's time to reload)
Cus it ain't never gonna stop cus we break the mold

[Chorus 2X]

[N-Tyce]
Ya'll better hear what I speak when I say what I say
When I rap, like a train laying the track
Paving the cracks, when the bass boom, better make room
When I'm rolling, steady pack heat when I'm holding
Tired of sitting, I'm too hot with spitting
Too hyper, they say I need ritalin
Too calm me down, I'm a problem child
When I'm out the studio, see how the song sound
Peep it, I'm the best kept secret
Matter of fact, the best chick to cheat with
But I don't kiss and tell
You're better off throwing pennies in the wishing well
And I wish you well, audios, goodbye, be gone
You ain't even on the same vibe we on
Stay cool, be strong, and I will for real
But it's only right to let ya'll know the deal

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
