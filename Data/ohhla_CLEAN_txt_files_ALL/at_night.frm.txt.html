[Verse One: Need Not Worry]
D-d-damn, he had a wife and a kid..
he had a...life that was his he wasnt to slip
a good job, free mileage on the company car
dollar an hour start, put the beat in his heart
5(Stay) calm and collected from the day of his wedding
when he wedded a woman that took a piece of his heart and kept it
they met in college, while learning of scholars
as the hour would pass, hot flash, get in the shower
they would make love, give a little just so they can take some
take one..minute to believe they ain't dumb...
struck, and they found the one they wanted to create from
ain't none...better so they did it and they made one
chap, called jack, they livin the life
living it like it was a fantasy with littlest hype
SIKE!!..but one day it had to break at the end
you know the downfall happens when you speak to your friend
when...the loyalty you had was creeping again
you gotta do a little favor just to keep it in sync
cus he's, on the down and out and beggin for help
he needs a quarter hundred thou from every card he was dealt
and now he got a debt, going to a bookey who threats
to take his life away unless he pays the money he bet
so the..family man will help him all that he can
can or he can not, got him to be part of the plan

Hook: 8 bars (all cuts!!never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death)

[Verse Two: Need Not Worry]
D-d-damn, he got a wife and a seed
he got a livin situation that he really achieved
but now, he can't grip, the favor he had promised
he can't slip, life or death is hanging by the hours
at 10 o'clock his man is pickin him up
his wife is buggin cause he jittery, she thinkin its drugs
the little one is tired and he's ready for bed
he want a little story read and then a kiss on the head...(muah)
good nite son, he smiling as he said it
(beep beep) lady sobbin and she yellin as he jetted
DEAD IT, she taking down the pictures of the wedding
while she contemplatin if this is the man she once wedded
it wasn't, recognized, not the first time
that the duo did a little deed of money made crime
when..shit was gettin deeper than a water waste line
they would make crime benefit cause water ain't wine
D-d-damn, she woke the little one and just bounced
the hubby and the buddy got their money and the headed
on their getaway, but they didn't get away fast
as they hit a cop baracade...hesitate! BLAST
duckin under dashboards of the black ford
as they blast more, getting what they didnt ask for
his past met the future, now he assed out thinking...
what he should had did, it only brought him back to the beginning.....

abrupt stop...STRAIGHT TO DEATH...</pre>
