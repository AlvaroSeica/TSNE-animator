What was going on (yeah, uh-ha)
When I wrote this
The Long Distance Runner
And recorded this (check it, yo)

Verse One:
Its 2004
Last year Tony and George started the war of the whores
Same year, and the year before, plus the year before that
Me and the Troop were on constant tours
Chanting Imbumba! from the South African shores
To the Norwegian fjords, I tried to keep a vegan course
Traveling with good friends like Chords
Timbuk and DJ Large, 
Jonny Bass and Big Boss
Before the Struggle album made the record stores
We were on a Road To Hell, breakin doors and laws
Me, Supreme, Gangsta Pete and Schumi of course
Had a little trouble with the German police force (aha)
That's why I had to stop drinking
Cause when I start drinking is when I stop thinking
That I gotta stay on top off things
And when I'm under the bottle you know I stop to think

(Chorus)
Like an athlete, a long distance runner
On a track meet spring, fall, winter, summer
They attack me, but it gon' make me stronger
Get at me dawg when your patience's longer
An athlete, a long distance runner
On a track meet spring, fall, winter, summer
They attack me, but it gon' make me stronger
Get at me dawg...

Verse Two:
Livin' in this free world 
Expecting cops to abuse me
When I'm chilling with a cup full of musely 
Matter of time 'fore my cup is running over
But I'ma get mine cause mahfuckers running slower (Yeah!)
Followin' my sprinter trail
I run shit down the line on the Interrail (Yeah!)
I ain't going, I ain't been to jail
I got work to do, and I got things to say
A real role model for the kids today 
Can't afford gettin' sent away, get them fingerprints away
Wipe off the mic every single stain
Recognize bomb shit when it's in my mail
What a big disgrace
What a big bam bam you had to end this way
All you ever wanted to was to entertain
Went against the wrong guy cause i was meant to stay...

Chorus

Verse Three:
The battle ain't for the strong
Nor the race for the swift
But for those who can't endure the type o' blaze that I spit
For those that will survive all the changes and shit
With families, fans, partners and labels you're with
And even if I wanted I wouldn't be able to quit
I gotta keep running til the pavement will split
Under my bare feet, the concrete with red heat
Or till my future kids eat, and we all livin' carefree
In a Zion hut, we ain't dawgs no more
Were my lion's at?
Gimme some signal let me see your lion paw
Let me know what we're living and what we're dying for
Ask myself
It's it a good enough reason
If so I go all out like it was my last season
If my, voice is weak
My boys will speak
To conquer the world I gotta keep a top physique

Chorus

No alcohol, no weed
No cigarettes, no Es
No milk, no cheese
No eggs, no meat
Just mediation and peace
Red lentils, chick peas
Good workout, good sleep
Mo' sunshine, light breeze</pre>
