(Hook, Master P)
Nigga turn a fo' to a half; You a genius
From a eight-ball, a thousand grams; You a genius
Put it on the stove, cook it up; You a genius
Break it down, bag it up, distribute it; You a genius
Sell weed on the porch, gettin paid; You a genius
G-G-Got ki's off the boat, street nigga; You a genius
P-P-Put in on the stove, cook it up; You a genius
Break it down, bag it up, distribute it; You a genius

(Verse 1, Master P)
Ask Joey where that rock at
Lebron James couldn't stop that
Posted up wit' my trill niggas, ain't nobody got that
It's soda pop and that water-water
Wal-Greens, sell any order
I'm a chemist on that stove, turn a soft eighth to a hard quarter
Livin like a nightmare
My rifle man be right there
I bubble up and I cook it up, I'm Einstein without the white hair
And I don't need no recipe but this microwave be cookin
I had to check my bitch for using the same pot that I cook in
Then I gave the rock to Boz and he brought me back some paper
Courtney dropped me off a gun and said "Keep that for them haters"
This applied knowledge I got, it ain't come from no book
If you make it out, you a genius; If you get caught, you a crook

(Hook, Master P)
Nigga turn a fo' to a half; You a genius
From a eight-ball, a thousand grams; You a genius
Put it on the stove, cook it up; You a genius
Break it down, bag it up, distribute it; You a genius
Sell weed on the porch, gettin paid; You a genius
G-G-Got ki's off the boat, street nigga; You a genius
P-P-Put in on the stove, cook it up; You a genius
Break it down, bag it up, distribute it; You a genius

(Verse 2, Alley Boy)
Much more than I seen
Came up from a triple beam
I'm a young G, how I mack em out my whole team
Can't speak too fluent
I can do anything if my mind put to it
No Limit Forever, don't change 'til the grave
All my G's influenced
All the change I pull
Laces down to the Louie V made bowls
Me and Benz on tour
Nigga here's a million dollars in my roll
Turnin twenty-four, turnin fourty-eight
I'ma knock 'em out with it
Never use the phone when you ride around with it
Chance, stop em, tell 'em I did it
Really gettin money? Y'all Barbie killers
Ask the boy, the Don; Percy Miller
Nigga this money stacked to the ceiling
From all this crack and weed dealing
Haters ain't any interference
Let 'em get to the money, that's gon kill 'em
Planning my steps, watching my moves
All my G's gon' feel him
Mob!

(Hook, Master P)
Nigga turn a fo' to a half; You a genius
From a eight-ball, a thousand grams; You a genius
Put it on the stove, cook it up; You a genius
Break it down, bag it up, distribute it; You a genius
Sell weed on the porch, gettin paid; You a genius
G-G-Got ki's off the boat, street nigga; You a genius
P-P-Put in on the stove, cook it up; You a genius
Break it down, bag it up, distribute it; You a genius

(Outro, Master P)
If you could look at it, and don't even need no scale
You a genius
If you could just cook that thang up, with the earl and shake it
You really a chemist, you a genius
But if you could clean ya dirty money up to good money and survive this crazy shit
You a genius, ya feel me?</pre>
