[Intro: King Just]
All hail... we have returned once again...
We play no games... we take no prisoners...
His royal high... King Just... No Power on Earth...
Entertainment brought by snap, watch your neck, for it gets cracked
It's for real here...

[Chorus: King Just]
Hey-hey-hey... (hee!) heyyyyyyyyyy-hey (ho!)
Hey-hey-hey... (hee!) heyyyyyyyyyy-hey (ho!)

[Hook: King Just]
Now everybody check what's going down
Same Shaolin M.C. from the underground
Niggas say they hate on me, I never lost my crown
I was the youngest M.C. ever putting it down
Now, you act like you wanna be this M.C.
No one can be J-U-S-T
All the kids love D-U-M-P
Cuz I kick shit that make you move your feet
Together we stand, and divided we fall
Killa Hill Projects, baby, off the wall
Said together we stand, and divided we fall
Killa Hill Projects, baby, off the wall

[King Just]
Huh, right back at cha, niggas better run
2000 Warrior's still banging on the Drum
Shaolin ShoGun, me fear no one
Like the dear ghost on ya back, I stay open
No win, everything I drop be official
It's been a long time since I left, guess who
Back to, give you what you need, six bricks of weed
And I shall succede and continue, to rock the mic right
As long as you can bump K.J. all night
Don that hold tight, shine light, how bright?
Bright enough to make terrors catch more fight
Bout to take flight as soon as they air the joint
Warrior's 2000, I think I made my point...
We back to give ya'll the business, the business

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
Look out, look out! Guess who's back with the bomb?
Who? Mr. Choke Armstrong
You, can't even touch this lead
What is it? It's a Shaolin thing
How, maybe cuz my style gets wild
Boom, straight to the muthafucking moon
Where, anywhere, I don't care
Who You? That means we muthafucking in there
Yeah, that's how shit is going down
Why, cuz I get down for my crown
What? That mean the ruckus is on
Word? When I say 'word'; word's bond
Damn, another funky jam from the man
When I step on the scene, it's like peh-dah-peh-dah
Pow, he'll me back from Staten Island
It's been a while and you can't get a circuit dial
Owww, that was old, hehehehe, that was new
If you hate me, I hate you
Zu hold us for ya, in your bomb, play me close by the bar
And there it is, baby pa

[Chorus to fade] </pre>
