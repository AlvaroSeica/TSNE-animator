(YEAH~!) It's Jugganot, I'm the hottest thing out right now
The four-fifth, the whole clip'll pop out right now
Go get your money honey, sunny droptop out now
Holla at me, you ain't gotta scream back out loud
The rose bottle, role model, blow hustler, gun buster
16 crusher, your flow need brush-up
I'm here to help you (why) my flow is Bellevue
Pound all the way down to dimes I can sell you
Even a line of wet, diamonds around your neck
I snatch that, that's why, I'm a maniac I
run this crack rap strapped macs in a baby backpack
Strip before I let this bitch get spit
Quick I gotta smash them with the Passion of Gibson
I make bitches listen, learn the lyrics and lip sync
Money by the minute you diminish when I spit it
Somebody's gettin admitted in hospitals when I'm finished
