[Intro: Prodigy]
The times of a New York nigga!

[Troy Ave]
This is how we 'gon do it! What's up?!

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Aiyyo times is hard but we get through 'em (Uh huh) 
And even though it's crime involved we had to do 'em
By any means, Malcolm X marks the spot (Blaow!)
I went from ridin bikes to ridin through in a drop
The road to success for me was real gritty (Real gritty)
Wasn't no stress for me, don't feel pity (Don't feel pity)
Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty (Nah)
And I'm a do me anyway nigga 
'Cause I'm from New York City

[Verse One: Troy Ave]
I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills
A young prodigy when it come to drug deals
In New York I get blood money
Dirty cash bought my matte black jeep, I use to skip out on cabs
Went from, givin no dough to givin limos
Ticket to shows, either way I'm driven, the shit shows
Spit flows like Bo sick hoes
Got a master rolex watch above my mo'
Drinkin champagne out the bottle, young Crisco
Poppin hop in let's politic ditto
Same niggas sayin time to get this money
They been the same niggas sayin that for years still hungry
New discussion New York artist wanna be southern
The city's lost, so out of towners find themselves frontin
It was Big, Jay-Z now Troy Ave here after
Kendrick Lamar's just a weirdo rapper

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Aiyyo times is hard but we get through 'em (Uh huh) 
And even though it's crime involved we had to do 'em
By any means, Malcolm X marks the spot (Blaow!)
I went from ridin bikes to ridin through in a drop
The road to success for me was real gritty (Real gritty)
Wasn't no stress for me, don't feel pity (Don't feel pity)
Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty (Nah)
And I'm a do me anyway nigga 
'Cause I'm from New York City

[Verse Two: Raekwon]
We went from Uzi's to elephant guns
Small pistols long ginsus, little shorties, cheeba, big forties
Sit back in the hood, good nigga good
Retrievin every dollar bill grabbin my wood
You know me specialist at night time
Call us the poisonous pumpers, who run up on these niggas like Nightline
The arsonists and good vines, that means the wares is amazin
Assignment baby since '89
Creepin through hallways, big laundry bags
Four k's, handle them niggas now jam niggas
Fuck they 'gon do with no cream?!
You might as well be a bum, 'cause you could never represent the money team
We smash faces smash bracelets that's the basic
Don't get smacked in your mouth, with forty five razors
Yeah the jungle brothers rollin with all coverage
Get 'em young Troy what he fucked with us!

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Aiyyo times is hard but we get through 'em (Uh huh) 
And even though it's crime involved we had to do 'em
By any means, Malcolm X marks the spot (Blaow!)
I went from ridin bikes to ridin through in a drop
The road to success for me was real gritty (Real gritty)
Wasn't no stress for me, don't feel pity (Don't feel pity)
Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty (Nah)
And I'm a do me anyway nigga 
'Cause I'm from New York City

[Verse Three: N.O.R.E.]
You know how I steady rock, New York City bop
Use to slang grainy rock, war on the petty block
Back to back cases, now we drink liquor drinkin back to back cases
No we ain't erasers
Spade hand aces, out of town papers
Luck's all Vegas, herb shit Avis
I graduated from the street life accordingly
Said my first rhyme on a jail phone reportedly
I've been shot niggas, since fourteen
I've been to war mean got guns from Fort Greene
I extorted niggas, I was the re-up man
I gave the order niggas, P.A.P.I. gave the order niggas
King flow use to get coke from Domingo
Then go in the old folks home he playin bingo
He, sold it for ten but I got it for cinco
Safe in the ceilin the guns under the sink flow

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Aiyyo times is hard but we get through 'em (Uh huh) 
And even though it's crime involved we had to do 'em
By any means, Malcolm X marks the spot (Blaow!)
I went from ridin bikes to ridin through in a drop
The road to success for me was real gritty (Real gritty)
Wasn't no stress for me, don't feel pity (Don't feel pity)
Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty (Nah)
And I'm a do me anyway nigga 
'Cause I'm from New York City

[Verse Four: Prodigy]
The life and times of a New York nigga we very different
Please pardon my aggression, but move from my vision
With that bullshit you spittin, you talkin my high off
You blowin my vibe, you forcin my iron off
My belt, I'm forcin myself to be chill
Go 'head listen to them journalist get yourself killed
They ain't never lived this life, and no near about it
They hide behind aliases and talk rowdy
From behind a MacBook
Fuck a blog dog I see you in the flesh you'll be shook
Like a martini, I know they tired of me
I know they wish I would die already but I'm very dope
I'm so cold you should get your February coat
That N.Y. shit you niggas got warm hearts
No offense but I'll tear you apart
No matter which part of the map you reppin get your weapon

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
Aiyyo times is hard but we get through 'em (Uh huh) 
And even though it's crime involved we had to do 'em
By any means, Malcolm X marks the spot (Blaow!)
I went from ridin bikes to ridin through in a drop
The road to success for me was real gritty (Real gritty)
Wasn't no stress for me, don't feel pity (Don't feel pity)
Life is a bitch and she sure ain't pretty (Nah)
And I'm a do me anyway nigga 
'Cause I'm from New York City
