I wanna be famous, I wanna be famous

Do you know how famous I am
TV trucks parked all over my land, all a part of the plan
Every single little fan shake my little hand
snort a little gram, rehab, and back again
What a wonderful life, what a wonder
make a hundred million dollars like I'm riding a bike
Got a butler for life, watch him butter my knife
bet ya everybody jealous, bet ya wonder what it's like
Dyed my hair blonde, wrote a hit song
got a dot com, bought Louis and Vuitton
Up until this year I lived at home with my mom
now I got a big bong filled with champagne
Be calm if you gonna approach
got ten bodyguards who wanna punch you in the nose
Better never come close, got a house on each coast
just to house fur coats and um, my bathrobes

Want everyone to know my name, I wanna be famous
Want cars, want cribs, wanna be the boss of the game
Don't wanna work all day, wanna chill with Dre, want a maid, wanna get paid
Want a limo and a plane, then I wanna complain, ok, I wanna be famous

Look, i never knew about the bloods and the crips
but I know about the tucks and the nips
College, I skipped, but got the collagen
in my lips, my tits, lipo, the hips
Check me out on Cribs, it's a trip
me and Prince eatin' ribs, drippin' on golden bibs
My private driveway is like the Verrazano bridge, I'm very much a bitch
Platinum fridge, I don't need it
cause I don't really ever eat but aww fuck it, I'm rich
It's tough when everybody wants your autograph
tough to get a cab when you wear a cap and you look crap
Middle finger, take a picture of that, that photo makes me look fat
That's bad, I look like Danny DeVito
just wanna jog incognito, what's with you people

Want everyone to know my name, I wanna be famous
Want cars, want cribs, wanna be the boss of the game
Don't wanna work all day, wanna chill with Dre, want a maid, wanna get paid
Want a limo and a plane, then I wanna complain, ok, I wanna be famous

Go on, have a Mentos, they're imported, I can afford it
Pinto to pentho, I'm boughetto
hey, get me something now, (why) I said so
Ooh, when I feel romantic, my vibrator got its own mechanic
Speaks Spanish, muchas gracias Manuel
I think I'll manage, make me a caviar sandwich
Damn this, paparazzi get lost, oh look, go chase Ozzy
My Versace's tight, big fight, punch another star
front page of the Star, it's alright
Cause we like always brawling, balling, got our lawyers calling
If you say mo' money, mo' problems
you just need a little bit more to solve 'em

Want everyone to know my name, I wanna be famous
Want cars, want cribs, wanna be the boss of the game
Don't wanna work all day, wanna chill with Dre, want a maid, wanna get paid
Want a limo and a plane, then I wanna complain, ok, I wanna be famous</pre>
