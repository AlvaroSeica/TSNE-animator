Ten! Nine! Eight!
Seven! Six! Five! Four!

Get ready fighters - it's showtime!

[DJ I-Dee]
Hi Timothy, it's your boy I-Dee
Part time emcee, super disc jockey
This ain't grind time, but bitch, it's Oz
And I'ma make you mine... just because

[Traphik]
Motherfuckin I-Dee, I'ma call your Isaac
My flow too tight, just like how my eyes get
Put this on my Facebook, no I didn't like it
And we are not friends, so hop up offa my dick

[DJ I-Dee]
The first one was written, dude what are you spittin?
You don't even know you just spit about chains and glisten
Battle rap attack, I'm six foot four, you're short
I suggest you use Gary Coleman's corpse for leg support

[Traphik]
Playboy hat but you get no play
How I'm fuckin hoes, you fuckin Jose
Goofy-ass fuck, you need to be slapped
You know you can't rap and your beats be whack

[Capcom scratching]
I can't believe my eyes
Final round!

[DJ I-Dee]
Here we go again, everyone look at Traphik
Constantly wishing his dick was big as a Vlasic
pickle... dude here's a nickel
Quick, what else rhymes with nickel? Shit

[Traphik]
You got no rhythm and you always look drunk
Tall as fuck but yo' ass can't dunk
I fucked yo' bitch, you better call Maury
And he popped a blood vessel on his dick - true story!

[DJ I-Dee]
Yeah I fucked up, dude you suck
I'm just gonna go generic and say WHAT WHAT!
like the N.O.R.E. song - you like a cocker spaniel
I'ma leave you dead like Pearl comma, Daniel

[Traphik]
I'ma kill your mom, and throw her in a lake
Your name is I-Dee cause you always be fake
Yo' ass cain't dress, you need to cut your hair
Turntable champ, cool - no one cares!</pre>
