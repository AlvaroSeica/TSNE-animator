[Intro/Chorus: Ice-T &amp; (D-Roc)]
You give me for honor (GRAVES!!)
Where your soldiers lay (GRAVES!!)
They're so far away (GRAVES!!)
The home of the brave 

[Hook: Ice-T]
I won't die in your bullshit wars no more 
(*Multiple shots by an Automatic Machine Gun*)
I won't fight to my death for you
I won't watch my poor mamma cry no more
Motherfuck your red, white and blue

[Chorus: Ice-T &amp; (D-Roc)]
You give me for honor (GRAVES!!)
Where your soldiers lay (GRAVES!!)
They're so far away (GRAVES!!)
The home of the brave 

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Thousands of men go to war 
To fight for old politics which they don't understand
Murder people who they never met
When they make it home they're considered a vet
Fire drops from the sky as the young boys die
Far from home, all alone, it's a sin
All you're getting return in is a shit shallow grave
Cause in war, there's no way you can win

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Am I ye.. yell right? - You think they give a fuck
You're just pawns in the game off the board
Brainwashed to the point where you kill at the drop of a dime
But it's not called a crime
Vietnam, Persian Gulf, did we win? did we lose?
Thousands die, human beings you choose
Once you're in, you are owned by the man
Uncle Sam is his name, you're enslaved, Shallow graves!!

[Chorus: Ice-T &amp; (D-Roc)]
You give me for honor (GRAVES!!)
Where your soldiers lay (GRAVES!!)
They're so far away (GRAVES!!)
The home of the brave 

[Hook: Ice-T]
I won't die in your bullshit wars no more
(*Multiple shots by an Automatic Machine Gun*)
I won't fight to my death for you
I won't watch my poor mamma cry no more
Motherfuck your red, white and blue
You give me for honor (*Echoed*)
