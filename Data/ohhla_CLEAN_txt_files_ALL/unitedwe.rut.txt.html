Album:  New York's Most Wanted
Song:   United We Stand
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Apocalipps (Truck)]
United we stand, divided we fall, the Bastardz
If you, roll with us, get yo guns, nigga, blast it (cock your shit/let's go)
Things just ain't the same no more
Promise me you gon' ride for the cause (I promise)

[Bless]
You like a hitman with no hammer, an English teacher with no grammar
A convict with no slammer
I'm the photographer taking snapshots with no camera
And when I pull out, you better say cheese
Cuz when I finish with this juks, I snatch the patch off your leaves
And your man on the corner getting packs from me
And you know your baby momma's getting packed by me
Fuck around and catch a slug for free, no cause
Paramedics pull up on the scene, no pause
Bullets crack your skull, brain on the floor, no thoughts
And I'mma be here from here on in
The industy is like the block and we want it
Fuck dice, nigga, I roof ya mic
Niggas thinking the shoes ain't tight
I get the Big Pun spirit in me and crush you niggas
Whoa, matter fact, yo Lipps, bust these niggas

[Apocalipps]
I'm still in the game, I snatch ya Xbox, stealing the game
I take your soul, now I'm stealing your frame
The heel of the gauge, pointed to the heel of your face
The grimreaper with the hoodie on, stealing your age
Ya niggas want attention, what the fuck, I acknowledge ya
Do a drive by on the bus and spray you up with the silencer
We got ill guns, that's why these niggas hate us
Bullets fall, they get up and get at you, like nigga chasers
Ya'll niggas falling behind, ya'll need to catch up
The cops can't catch us, they artists can't sketch us
Now who gon' ride when the time is real
Who gon' step up in the clutch when it's time to kill
And that's a good question, and only you know the answer
Now you could, take your oath as you sing the anthem

[Chorus]

[Truck]
It's obvious I write for the street, I'm all hard
You can catch me late night without heat, it's all good
Respect it, cough on my watch and my necklace
You know that night, Truck came back busting reckless
The pitcher on the mound, I throw a shot, you catch it
Strike out, you're out, this is a Ruthless night out
My nickname Con Ed, nigga, I put your lights out
Yeah, you got money, your Coupe is real
But I'm the type to do a drive by in a Snoop Deville
And sped off through a three sixty, and when I blow
I'm taking the whole Staten Island with you
And all my four eighteen niggas, wilding with me
High off the blueberry, drunk off the fucking Henny
I'm about to clear this whole block with the semi
Automatic, and ya'll niggas can't fuck with these Bastardz
I got some shit with a clip that'll fuck up your fabrics
I'm in a whole different lane, I can't fuck with you faggots
Lick off, lick off, lick off

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
