Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I taste you infinite colors
Collide in a fountain
I missed all the lovers
Kaleidoscope dream [x6]
Dreaming you, imagine a feel of red lights
They flicker them flashes
It draws you electric
Kaleidoscope dream [x6]
Oh oh, dream
Oh oh, close your eyes
Oh oh, reach high
Taste the sky
Just hold my hand
Across the Moon hold to fly
You're safe with me, you're safe with me
Yeah, body language like piano king
Allow me to provoke the
Like you sing a melody
Every single stroke babe
As I kiss your third eye
Bet you're gonna scream
Only you can be my Kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
All these alien illusions of amusement
Like them stars fall from the sky
Kaleidoscope dream [x6]
Yeah
Body language like piano keys
Allow me to provoke the
Like you sing a melody
Every single stroke babe
As I kiss your third eye
Bet you're gonna scream
Only you can be my Kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Oh oh, reach high
Taste the sky
Just hold my hand
And close the Moon them hold to fly
You're safe with me, you're safe with me
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)</pre>
