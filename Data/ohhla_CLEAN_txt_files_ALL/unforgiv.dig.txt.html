Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
They wanna take away my black card
cause I got a black card say I don't rap hard cause I don't act hard
But if I act hard they would say that's odd and they would still hate I don't get that part
I'm too boys to be one of the boys think I got a man servant with your pride of toy
Why yall so salty? Too much sodium soy
Can ya brother get a q that you only destroy
Why should I apologize, for my father's wallet size?
Now they wanna get volentell had my mother share the pain in Ms. Wallet's eyes?
Nah, we den came to far. Why my brothers gotta fight like Mufasa and Scar?
Get caught up in the system that they profitin off
And they don't see none of the profits at all. Uhh

[Chorus]
Look how far we've come from singing freedom songs
So why can't we get along?
My brother why are you questioning from this point?
Uhh and to the homies I say you can't deny me my
(UN)forgivable blackness [x3]
Hey! Yeah!

[Verse 2]
I can see Malcolm at the podium on the ground and Betty Shabazz holdin him
He tried to fight em but his wounds took a toll on em
Dr. King too man they got both of em
The governments war for petroleum in the streets
try to take control of it every hood from Oakland to Magnolia
Black men I don't know what came over us
Stop the silliness my nigga
I would never revenge my nigga
And I don't spell it with an "er" I spell it with an "a" cause that is not what we are
We were once kings til we got consumed by material things
Womanizing all the women the material brings, it's sick it's powerful let's hear it again!

[Chorus]
Look how far we've come from singing freedom songs
So why can't we get along?
My brother why are you questioning from this point?
Uhh and to the homies I say you can't deny me my
(UN)forgivable blackness [x3]
Hey! Yeah!

[Verse 3]
You think you know, but you don't know the half of it
I don't rap for the cash in it
I do it cause I'm passionate
It's my desitny I have to spit
The real MC's I'm the last of it
Uhh, I ain't down cause I ain't from the ghetto
Camera liked the scar face, but I'll be all fellow
I ain't from the projects, I'm more from the meadows
We've both seen racism, I'm on the same level
From Memphis to Zimbabwe yall got the same blood that's in my veins
I ain't the enemy so why you in my face?
I ain't yo enemy so let's make peace

[Chorus]
Look how far we've come from singing freedom songs
So why can't we get along?
My brother why are you questioning from this point?
Uhh and to the homies I say you can't deny me my
(UN)forgivable blackness [x3]
Hey! Yeah!</pre>
