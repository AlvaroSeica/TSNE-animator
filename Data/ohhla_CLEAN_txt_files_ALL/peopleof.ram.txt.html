[Zack de la Rocha]
Yea, people come up..
Yeah..We betta turn the bass up on this one..
Check it..

[Verse 1ne]
Check it, since fifteen hundred and sixteen, minds attacked and overseen
Now crawl amidst the ruins of this empty dream
With their borders and boots, on top of us
Pullin knobs on the floor, of their toxic metropolis
But how +YOU+ gonna get what you need to get?
The gut eaters, blood drenched get offensive like Tet
The fifth sun sets get back reclaim
The spirit of Cuauht√©moc, alive and untamed
Now face the funk now blastin out your speaker 
on the one - Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal ya name but now you got a gun 
Yeah, this is for the people of the sun!

[Chorus]
It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin back around again! Uh...
It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin back around again! Uh..

[Verse 2wo]
Yeah, never forget THAT the whip snapped ya back
Ya spine cracked for tobacc-oh, I'm the Marlboro Man, uh
Our past blastin on through the verses
Brigades of taxi cabs rollin Broadway like hearses
Troops strippin zoots, shots of red mist
Sailors blood on the deck, come sista resist
From tha era of terror, check this photo lens
Now the City of Angels does the ethnic cleanse, uh
Heads bobbin to the funk out ya speaker 
on the one - Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal ya name but now you found a gun 
You're history! This is for the people of the sun

[Chorus]
It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin back around again! Yeah...
It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin back around again! 

...

It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!!
It's comin back around again! 
It's comin back around again! - This is for the people of the sun!!
It's comin back around!!      - ...of the sun
