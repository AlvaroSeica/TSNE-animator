(Repeat 2x)

R. Kelly
Hey, you'se a rock star baby
Up in the building makin the club go crazy
Hey, you'se a rock star baby
Throw an ass like that, you must be a rock star baby

[Ludacris]
Luda, hey
I'ma strung yo body ya body like a guitar string
Stuntin in Roberto Cavalli mami wit the dime phrame
Hotter than tamales, you probably should be my wild thang
Tell them other chicks to mind they business and let us do our thang
I gotcha open, ya open strokin, now you soak and wet
And I'm not from Texas but I hold 'em, rope 'em, and I yoke they neck
You gon make a player choose, show me what that thang'll do
Class is in session, let me show you a thang or two
I'll strip ya, I'll strip ya down to your bare minimals
And I'll, I'll lick ya, I'll lick y'all down, you taste like cinnamon
And I'll grab a little bit of that whip cream, then I'll put her on the back, get mean
Then I'll get her in a matrix, cut her like lasik, basically make her scream
At the top f her lungs (Ahh) give her shortness of breath
How many times can you cum before I poke you to death
Someone call in the ref, Ludacris is tired of playin
In the middle of the stage with an ass like that, you got everybody sayin

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Hey, you'se a rock star baby
Up in the building makin the club go crazy
Hey, you'se a rock star baby
Throw an ass like that, you must be a rock star baby

Say, I'm a rock star baby
Fuckin with this weed and patrone got me hazy
Hey, I'm a rock star baby
So put 'em up if you'se a rockstar baby

[R Kelly]
Girl, yo botty so swoll, how you got them jeans around it?
Girl, yo booty so swoll, why you think I'm singin about it?
Hit it hard from the back and then I go to sleep and dream about it
It's like that ass is crack the way you got me fiendin about it
I'm tellin you now, the way we fuck only to child birthin
Rockin to this guitar is about to have me crowd surfin
Kells'll put on a show up until the closed curtains
Then right after the show, backstage, ass hurtin
Call me Scottie cause girl I'm bout to beam up
Once I get ya, get ya, I'm comin up out them B cups
Strokin it up, strokin it hard while you go your legs up
Makin ya, makin ya sound like you got the hiccups
Know what you want cause I'm boutt o give you what you need
Up in my room, you screamin "Hercules! Hercules!"
Man, get Kells and Luda on a track, a hit is guaranteed
Evrybody on your feet, this is what your shirt should read

[Chorus]

[Kid Rock]
I got my drink in my cup, I got my hands in the air
I'm bout to set this bitch off, like I'm a rock star baby
We out of this club, bout to hit the after party
All the ladies comin with me, cause I'm a rock star baby

[R. Kelly]  (Kid Rock)
So put your hands up (So put your hands up, so put your hands up)
Everybody in the building, come on, bounce with me

[R. Kelly &amp; Kid Rock]
IF YOU'SE A ROCK STAR

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Lights, st-st-stamina, action
I'm a rock star, check the crowd reaction, I'm like
(Repeat until fade)</pre>
