What the fuck is that?

[MURS]
In my era, we used to call it "Stilo"
That's Spanish for "style," estupido
It used to be all tranquilo
Never thought I'd live to see the day you'd stoop this low
We grew up in the same environment
Shared the same spray paint and markers and shit
Now you lookin' for a early retirement
Cause every day you hate on me, you talk like a bitch
Scared the hell out you, didn't I?
Sittin' wit' ya girl on the couch watchin Youtube
Couldn't even look me in the eye
Tried to play it off like "what's up, my dude?"
Must've forgot about me, huh
I'm still from the block, I just look a little strange
but we can talk about it, bro
We can step off in the front yard and throw them thangs
but you don't wanna go against me
You really wanna kick it when push comes to shove
You actin silly cause you miss me
And this is the way that you show me love

[Chorus: Slug]
You need to focus those eyes on the time
It was right, then ya life, then ya rhymes, then the prize
And I don't even think you lookin at the prize
I think you killin' time lookin' at what's mine

[Slug]
Some people call it swagger
I'm a little bit older, so I still call it mojo
it really doesn't matter, nah
if you got it you get it, if you don't then it won't grow
I heard that they was mad at me
Do I care? No, the evil doesn't see a scarecrow
Flashback to old strategies
Cause you gotta be careful, when these crabs in the barrel
Slow down, hit my hometown
Cats talk a lot of smack, so what's up wit' that?
I been around the globe now
and I snuck back, just to let you know that it was fuckin' flat
Come down off the jackass
You should put both feet on the ground, oh, so real
You ain't built for revenge math
Just talent and voice, wit' no social skill
This goes to too many people
If you feel offended, come and get wit' the kid
I'm not better than you, nah, I'm equal
but when I went to do it, I meant what I did

[Chorus 2x: Slug]
You need to focus those eyes on the time
It was right, then ya life, then ya rhymes, then the prize
And I don't even think you lookin at the prize
I think you killin' time lookin' at what's mine
