The whole world's a sweatshop, a fascist regime
With billions of parts working as a massive machine
The goal, keep the masses passive between
Self, cash, limousines and other fabulous things
But, we gotta wake up and notice it's a load of shit
It's all about ownership of your soul and who's controllin' it
It's not about the gold you get, not about the clothes you're in
It's not about oil, but we're killing each other over it
Like a Doberman, chomping on a cat
It's a new world order, and they're bombin on Iraq
And it's so fucking heartless, the whole country's starved
And yet they've been targeted as a threat regardless
This all started in days prior to ours
They arrived from the stars, and survived in the dark
Now it's time for the hearts of men
To march against it
And realize that the cycle starts and ends with

[Chorus]
Us, we're the ones that paid for the bombs
Us, we built the planes that they're on
Us, it's insane all of the ways they conned us
But we can change it today, it's just all on
Us, we're the ones that paid for the bombs
Us, we built the planes that they're on
Us, it's insane all the ways we've been conned
Into killing millions of innocent people, but it's all on
Us.

Trust me friends, it could never just be us, or just be them
Sometimes I think it just depends, it's just pretend
You can never trust the trends
Don't rub your eyes, I'd rather you'd adjust the lens
Look up to them? Tell me, who the fuck are they?
When did they ever give a damn about what you say?
For what you stand? That's why you gotta trust me man
Trust a Bush? That's like saying trust Sadam
But for real, I mean you gotta love the fam
Ask his dad the ex-prez how many drugs he ran
So trust us, the shit's about to flood the land
Cause government hands can no longer plug the dam
So fuck the news, fuck the critics, fuck their views
And if you sit and let it happen then fuck you too
It's up to you, I can't tell you what to do
But touch the truth, and don't just judge the few
But judge

[Chorus]
Us, we're the ones that paid for the bombs
Us, we built the planes that they're on
Us, it's insane all of the ways they conned us
But we can change it today, it's just all on
Us, we're the ones that paid for the bombs
Us, we built the planes that they're on
Us, it's insane all the ways we've been conned
Into killing millions of innocent people, but it's all on
Us.

But it's all on Us
But it's all on Us
But it's all on Us
But it's all on Us
But it's all on Us
But it's all on Us</pre>
