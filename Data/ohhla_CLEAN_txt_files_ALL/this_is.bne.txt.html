[Intro: Bizzy]
You can't do that, ha ha
1, 2, you ready, yeah I'm ready
1, 2, you ready, yeah I'm ready (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I say 1, 2, you ready, yeah I'm ready (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I say 1, 2, you ready, yeah I'm ready
They say rock, him, rock out, I'm finna clock out
1, 2, you ready, yeah I'm ready
I say rock, him, rock out, I'm finna clock out

[Bizzy Bone]
I pop out my Glock, though I'm in the war, chillin in the rocks
Cocksucker motherfucker, see the snakes that he drop
The sheer magnitude, mad at you, sad for you and yours
When I come screamin around the corner, never tell 'em about the car
I walk alone, soft rrrope, fist blaze the torch
Jump off the porch, hot lava, that's just kitchen cajun scorch
Take on the army in my wretchedness, catch it Â– it's gon' happen
I got kids in this, with the four winds for the backin
The troops are lackin, troopin, who was the man with the mini-mac
in the backpack, and buck at the West Coast, fire spit out of the 'llac
Yeah I like that, one true, they gon' have to kill us
They can suck the devil's nuts if thay wanna, I'll take the cuts
Cause I'm the realest in this motherfucker hands right now
You want the best? Do with the seed and his glory, I'll be around
Clown, if you wanna, huh, laugh all day
I'm serious, next dimension on the galaxy, hey!

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
This is a warnin, warnin, warnin - how long can you see me dawg?
This is a warnin, warnin, warnin - it's real at night on TV dawg
This is a warnin, warnin, warnin - how long can you see me dawg?
This is a warnin, this is a warnin - it's real at night on TV dawg
This is a warnin, warnin, warnin - how long can you see me dawg?
This is a warnin, warnin, warnin - it's real at night on TV dawg
This is a warnin, warnin, warnin - how long can you see me dawg?
This is a warnin, this is a warnin - it's Bone Thug, yeah

[Layzie Bone]
Lil' L-Burna, I keep my thang cocked, pop shots to The Glock
Time is still tickin but this ain't the same watch got props locked from hip-hop
Lock stocks in big whop, hell naw a nigga ain't flip-flop
You hustle to make yo' moves, I hustle to get to the tip-top
Lock and load it, and I'm classic like a throwback
Livin legends in yo' presence, y'all motherfuckers y'all know that
Take a picture, like it's Kodak, gotta stay G'd up from the feet up
I'm the trigger man for God's gun, please believe in Jesus
He can free us, from this crazy world
When you wanna see the beauty, look at Layzie's girl - she just so beautiful
And I love my kids dawg, I'm all about my biz y'all
Even if I fall, I can get up again and ball
All life long, I'ma get up, get out and get it
On all my songs, I'ma make these niggaz feel it
What I'm buildin is these pyramids, y'all better be takin me serious
Some of y'all fools ain't hearin this, my heart is near and dear to this

[Chorus]

[Thin C]
They called my granny Mable, feed her the scraps from under the table
Said it was good and healthy, and now it's makin us disabled
Organized genocide like cancer and HIV, made it yo'
center for disease, control; now let's take a toll
First they put it in Africa, and then San Francisco
The infamous death quota; they hate exposure
Ways to keep you blind from high class crimes 
to the sinister minister dressed in white with an anti-Christ mind
Now this your warnin time

[Cutthroat Raw]
That's already been rich, I got the upper hand on you niggaz
Already been there and done it
Take over your dark spots with guns to your stomach
Pillowcase over your face, make niggaz run it
Pop your partner in the leg, let you know we ain't frontin
Found the money in they shoes in they closets, all hundreds
Been back to the dungeon where, nobody's watchin
Instead of me breakin bread - {I'ma murk my accomplice}

[Chorus]</pre>
