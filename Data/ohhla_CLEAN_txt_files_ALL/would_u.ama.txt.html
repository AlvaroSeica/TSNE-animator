[Dr. Ama]
Girl, I wanna, put dick in you
Just to see, how good you screw
Hips and ass, fill up them jeans
The way you dance, you want me in between
Touching yourself, you teasing me
On your knees, open mouth come please a G
Girl you know a nigga wanna tap that spine
Doing crime, having sex, stay on the mind
Before I bend you over, hit it from behind
Keep it real with a G

[Chorus 2X: Dr. Ama]
Now would you lie for me, do crime for me
Hold these grimes for me, blow the nine for me

[Dr. Ama]
Girl, a time is come, show and prove
I've sucked enough, I wanna feel your juice
Slide that coochie, down on me babe
Spread them hips, and fuck me, babe
Show me how you, move your covers, babe
Give all up, inside that pussy, babe
I know you love a nigga taping the spine
Doing crime, having sex, stay on the mind
You can only cum at the same time
Whispering while you riding by

[Chorus 2X] </pre>
