[Mr. Pookie]
You heard tha sound of a boom, didnt see me hit yo body repeatedly
Burnin in yo capsule, hittin corners through yo artery
Dont bother me please, I got control of this land
Dont give a fuck, I'll fly again and again in yo hand
Or his or her, I have no ears, I cant hear wha's tha problem
But wheneva my homies stunt, you best believe I'll resolve em
AK blastin no warnin, cant wait to jus be release
Soon as I spit out tha barrel, niggaz betta move, I cant see
No mo peeps, this aggrevated hot rounds of me
Jus cant wait to see us, we too swift, bitch we comin in flees
On yo knees, feel tha wrath of these itty bitty fellaz
Come get it if you dare us, through his own, now he's took care of
Betta pair up and hit yo ass in multiples of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
Tryin to duck but it went all tha way in, no mo friends
Jus faces of a desparate one, I aint gotta face yo son
Jus look at tha angry one who held tha gun
Lookin 4 me, I'm all up in ya, explosive once I enter
And leavin big ol holes so you remember
And gainin up on speed every second, keep goin til I get em
I'm deadly when I'm sparked, that's a lesson

Chorus[x2]

Who I Be? That loud bang that always keep em duckin
Who I Be? An element been know to kill for nuthin
Whatcha see? Eternally now caught up in tha darkness
Fuckin wit artillery that's heartless

[Solo]
I came to you extremely heavy, I definitely aint no nigga
I'm quick to resolve shit wit one movement of tha finger
I split ligaments, fuck tha innocent
I one of tha causes for tha high death toll in tha world today
But neva face imprisonment
Cant see me when I'm movin cause I'm practically invisble
I'm known throughout tha world to cause pain in individuals
If you're ever confronted wit danger, please let me handle it
I guarnatee to destroy all in this world wit some gansta shit
Fuck tha pastors, tha schoolteachers, children and yo momma
I don took tha lives of Presidents and street thugs on tha corner
I'm tha definition of death row
Have you froze wit a tag on ya left toe
Or tha hospital bed wit ripped throat

Chorus[x2]

[Mr. Pookie &amp; Solo]
As I leave up out tha barrel, army fatigue apparel
Finna give this nigga a bone marrow
Took care of situations that gave chase afta chase off
Hit em directly in his forehead, now his face off
He fired from my ass, jus look out for wha I'm shittin
Twistin, bleedin and chokin, wide open when I'n hittin
So listen together, we be as deadly some nerve gas
As tha words past, baby get tha last laugh
Movin swiftly, 9 outta 10 I left him critically
eternal injuries left no hope or possiblities
As long as I don struck him, violence will neva cease
It's me tha deadly one, mo painful than a dose of HIV
I be 10 times badder than tha baddest hood nigga
I be 10 times badde than them bustas that pull triggas
Challenge or duel, so understand how tha fuck I'm feelin
These bitch made niggaz, gettin a reputation off my killin
All my Ghetto children were meant to be born killaz
We enter in warm niggaz, leavin homies to mourn niggaz
We be quick to bomb niggaz, when we come tumblin down
I don hit yo chest makin you do that gurgilin sound

Chorus[x2]
