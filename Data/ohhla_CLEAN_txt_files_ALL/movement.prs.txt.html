Song:   Don't Stop the Movement
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Paris]
Guerrillas in the mist
The mainstream team with pro-black twist
Hard truth soldiers in the game
Hard truth soldiers back again
P Dog, I evolve
I drag pigs to the slaughter house, vut I never eat hog
As the fed and the World Bank seesaw
We keep y'all in deep awe cause we raw
Like uncooked crack by the government
Hit like a base rock, listen to the bass knock
Free 'em in Jena, by any means they walk
Let's see who ready to squeeze
Givin power to the people and take back America
Panic in the head of the state, pass the Derringer
Aim and shoot, Beruit to Bay Area
Bury a Homeland Security card carrier

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Don't stop the movement! Don't stop it, don't stop it
Don't stop it, don't stop it

[Paris]
Panther power, acid showers
This land is ours, stand and shout it
This plan to cower, isn't ours
This man is proud, keep the scandalous out
Now if it ain't what we about, it's irrelevant
U.S. policy route? Embarrassin
Never leavin you without, we got medicine
And we never bend, we got better sense
Hard truth revolutionary black militant
Death to the Minutemen, checks to the immigrants
Streets still feelin it, we still killin it
We still slaughterin hawks, feed the innocent
Read the imprint
Guerrilla Funk was birthed outta necessity, collectively
Respectively, to behead the beast
On behalf of the left wing scared to speak, NOW GET UP~!

[Chorus]

[Paris - in background over Chorus]
Yeah... hell yeah... that's right

[Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan]
Something is WRONG!
Wrong with the government in which we live
Wrong with the leaders that lead us
Wrong with us... and the way we respond, to our enemy and each other
This nation is not about poor people!
Whether they're black, brown, red, yellow or white
This nation is about RICH people!
And to hell with the weak, the poor, they must serve~!

[Chorus] - overlaps Farrakhan's speech

[added to Chorus]
Don't stop it, don't stop it
Don't stop it, don't stop it

[Paris]
Guerrilla on the loose
Scars on my neck but I'm holdin on the noose
Stars rock ice but they rollin like Roots
Thugs on the mic but they all shine shoes
See I don't care who you is or where you from
You look like slaves and tricks when soldiers come
And anybody disagree can get done
Coons'll run, battle lines are drawn
Take one for the U.S.A., the new Babylon
Renegade nation formed to do battle on
Man-made war for mind control, carried on
Mainstream media platforms to rattle y'all
But I can't be shook by the White House
Never go the right route, that's the right route
Bury me a 'G' for Guerrilla and I climb out
With the nine out, no time for time out
Get up!

[Chorus]

[repeat 8X to end]
The people, united, will never be defeated</pre>
