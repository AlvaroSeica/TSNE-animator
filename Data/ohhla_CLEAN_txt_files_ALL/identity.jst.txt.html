[King Just]
Beats don't fail me now, boom bow
My style, still on your dial, child
Ain't nothing changed but extended alias names
Like Mr. Choke Armstrong, if you talking flames
Henny Handsome, just in case ya'll niggas drink
Hannibal Smith, plans come together when a nigga think
Optimus Shine, I got to gets mine
Captain Hook, I guess they scared of my rhymes
Bumpy Johns, they putting clamps on me
AKA Chokemon, buy your own fucking weed
Bad apple seed, that bad ass in me
Stone Cold Gold, hang with Ted DiBiase
This is basketball, I'll be slamming to win
My government will be age in the answer, answering
Or what about football, you would call me Barry
With a hundred yards, 4 touchdowns and 40 carries
Carlton Banks, my shit don't stank
The nigga with the mink buying me drinks
Loose like the Linx, cousin'll jinx
And when I get paid, I'mma buy me a panther and dye the shit pink
That's how I think, gats go with G.I. Joe
For you chickens Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigalo, yo
Drunken Monk backward jumpyard funk
Asking MC's how many lumps you want?
One, two, you couldn't show me the money
Fred G. Sanford of rap, you big dummy
Fast food junkie, high school flunky
Niggas don't like me and the kids still bug me
Shit starting, uh-um, beg you pardon
Protest through your projects like Al Sharpton
Step ya game up, get the green up from Medina
They call me "Oats" I got Cream of Wheat to hit farina
Oh-7-40, that's the beemer on the beeper
He looking good as the driver, that's how I keep her
Treat her like a prostitute, I thought I passed that
So be in mine, fuck around and get they ass capped
Smash that, industry rhymes
I can see through my left eye, that I'm a R.J. Rise
Suprise, no guys can break these tides
Arnold Schwarzenegger, seduce you with 'true lies'
From the battle of the beats or the belly of the beast
Big chief ganja leaf saying "peace, peace, peace, peace"</pre>
