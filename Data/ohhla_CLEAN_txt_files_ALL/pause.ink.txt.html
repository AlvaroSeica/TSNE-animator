Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Same shit, different day
These niggas talk, like they fuckin gay
I don't care, I only talk to bitches
But if they come and ask, you tell em that I mentioned
Fuck em, Fuck em, Fuck em, pause
Fuck em, Fuck em, Fuck em, pause
Fuck em, Fuck em, Fuck em, pause
Fuck em, Fuck em, Fuck em, pause

I said its Kid Ink baby
Takin shots with your lady
Body like a Mercedes
Ass thick as grandma gravy
Give a fuck about your feelings nigga save the shit for Debbie
All I smoke is that fire and bitch all I spit is that kerosene
Bout to barbeque you niggas, Well done without no Drama
Takin shots at your head til you look like Ronald McDonald
In full stereo nigga its no mono e mono
Bars kickin like I'm Ryu, feel that 16 hit combo
When it comes to smellin that money nose like I'm Ganzo
And my bitch yea she bad, got her hair like Rapunzel
Talk shit if you want, I got ears like I'm Dumbo
I don't care if you whisper nigga I can hear you mumble, it ain't nothin

Same shit, different day
These niggas talk, like they fuckin gay
I don't care, I only talk to bitches
But if they come and ask, you tell em that I mentioned
Fuck em, Fuck em, Fuck em, pause
Fuck em, Fuck em, Fuck em, pause
Fuck em, Fuck em, Fuck em, pause
Fuck em, Fuck em, Fuck em, pause</pre>
