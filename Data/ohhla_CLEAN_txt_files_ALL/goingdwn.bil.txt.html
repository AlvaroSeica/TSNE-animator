[Hook]
Single ladies get your drink on, tipsy at the bar
Looking real good, feeling real good like a star
Get on the dance floor, and say it real loud
It's going down tonight, hey
All the fellas in the club, in the VIP
G'd up smelling good, and got your own money
Get on the dance floor, quit holding up the wall
Say, it's going down tonight

[Billy Cook]
It's going down tonight, baby we can take it to the bar
Cause the drinks on me, see you looking like a star
I love the way that dress fit ya, let's take a picture
And I gon lie, sexy thang I wanna hit ya
Put you in the thug mode, going hard in the paint
When I put it in your life, it'll make you wanna faint
Rub your body down with lotion, got you in the love motion
Going deeper than the ocean, got you fiending for the stroking
A beast with it, young black male but got tricks
Standing five foot five, but size ain't bout shit
I can show you, better than I tell you
So put your mind on me, baby girl I dare ya
See it ain't all about the sex but I wreck, in the bed fa sho
Just give me forty-five minutes, have you loving the note
I know I study women, like I study a track
And if they attitude ain't right, I'm forced to lean back

[Hook]

[Billy Cook]
Hey ladies (yeah), I said ladies (yeah)
Can we get away, take a trip in my Mercedes
I wanna do you in the middle, play your body like a fiddle
Up and down like a sizzle, baby girl are you with it
Uh-oh, uh-oh
So slow, like in the videos
Bounce-bounce with it, slow-mo with it
I'm bout to bubble with it, get in trouble with it
Lord have mercy, strike a pose with it
Take it home later on, and do the fool with it
I like big lips big whips, grip big hips
Shorty, the way you move and dip
Put that bubble on me ma, go over what you know
Make it do what it do, till your knees are so' ha

[Hook]

[Lil Kano]
It's on and popping, till the morning come
Somebody gotta drive, Kano got another one
I'm popping bottles with a model on my lap, spitting game like a G
Got the key to the Benz, baby girl let's flee
To the Motel 6, or the Holiday Inn
Six o'clock on the dot, and your hot like your friend
She can come too, no telling what she might do
She could come too, after I put it on you
I'm back down, keeping it raw like Smack Down
Gotta feel me now, baby I'm full of Jack now
And that Crown got me running a mile, I'm dizzy
And I flow so back, it got me busy
On stage with her waist, keep it crunk in the club
Billy Cook, singing his ass off we got love
