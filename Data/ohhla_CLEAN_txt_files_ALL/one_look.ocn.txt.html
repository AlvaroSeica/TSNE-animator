[Frank Ocean]
I've seen it and I liked it much
I told myself I had to have it
I look but I do not touch
Wonderin why she walk like that that that that
There was somethin in those jeans
Locked up
It was dying to be free
And it was bound to happen, ohhhh
Didn't have a pick up line to use
I'm way too cool, way too cool
Ohh whoa-ohh and instead I'm hopin you're watchin me too
Like I watched you

[Chorus]
It took one look
Ohhh {*3X*}
Just that one look
Ohhh {*2X*}
What was I to do but look
Ohhh I couldn't stop starin
No, I couldn't run away from you
No, didn't stop
Nooo {*2X*}
Just took one look

[Frank Ocean]
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look
My eyes must have been on drugs
You callin me, check me so crazy
I couldn't see the floor beneath you
But baby I could see you pacin
on thin air, mid-air, no
Long brown hair swinging, no
Red bottoms in your high heels
Like I'm watchin a Blu-Ray
You in HD baby and I didn't know what to say
I'm way too cool, way too cool
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And I, you know I'm hopin you're watchin me too
Oh yeah, you know it's true

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
I wanna stare at you some more
But I can feel you in my soul
I'm not lookin from the outside
I could feel you inside mine
I wanna grab that body
Touchin that booty, feelin on your booty
Say that you love it
And you said it's all mine

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro: repeat 2X]
Yeah yhat's a good look baby baby
That's a good look darlin
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look</pre>
