Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
You know that I love you
Your my baby angels
Always thinking of you
Your my baby angels
Put no one above you
Your my baby angels
Give you all my world
Won't stop loving you
Loving you loving you

I was blessed to have you
Come into my world
Now I can't imagine life without you
I couldn't breathe without you
Your the ones who keep me going
Keep my heart beating
Keep me looking up
Appreciate of what I been given
Laying down at night looking
At your little faces
I don't have to wonder I know
This is were my place is
Gotta alot of love to give but
It's all yours
Writing you a million songs
So you would know
Just how much you mean to me
No matter what
If your good or bad
And when you happy or sad
Listen my angel babies
My angels from above
You are my everything and
So for you it's all my love
Mama don't cry
But I cry because I love you
More then anyone because I'm
Always thinking of you
If one day I should leave
This earth
This is your song
Please forgive me for my faults and
Whatever I did wrong

[Chorus]
You know that I love you
Your my baby angels
Always thinking of you
Your my baby angels
Put no one above you
Your my baby angels
Give you all my world
Won't stop loving you
Loving you loving you

I always try to give you
Whatever I was able and if I
Left you one day it was cause
I wasn't stable I remember when I
Step out the sadest little faces
Reaching up to get me
It was hard for me to face it
Mommy why you leaving I
Though you said you love us
Don't you want us anymore
The truth is your my life
And for you I would take a life
I would give you both my heart
Before that ever crosses my mind
Your a part of my soul
Part of everything about me and
This because of you that I
Thank god your still around me
You helped me carry on when
The going gets tough and
Remind me to be strong
When I feel like I've had enough
Me and you against the world
That don't even matter
I have you both around me and
My life I is full of laughter
Your the only reason that
I keep on living
It's cause of you and all the love
That you've given

[Chorus]
You know that I love you
Your my baby angels
Always thinking of you
Your my baby angels
Put no one above you
Your my baby angels
Give you all my world
Won't stop loving you
Loving you loving you

To my littlest pumpkin
My baby little lumpkins
Your such a beauty queen
To anyone you would
Be a dream those
Eyes of yours captivated my soul
Had to be god who sent me
Such a beautiful doll
To you my devotion bottled up
Beauty such a little missy
Such a grumpy little cutie
My brown queen my first
Born my doll face
I love you
"Mommy's Little Girl"
Was written for you
My melody was so I
Could keep on going
My drive to succeed
While I see you growing
I made a promise
That I do attend to keep
And this I mean it
If you need something
I'm a get it
My little lady
My boss little krazie
My babies you know
You always have amazed me
Love my angels more then
The moon loves the sky
If I was happy you were
The only reasons why

[Chorus]
You know that I love you
Your my baby angels
Always thinking of you
Your my baby angels
Put no one above you
Your my baby angels
Give you all my world
Won't stop loving you
Loving you loving you</pre>
