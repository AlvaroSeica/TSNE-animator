[Richard Blackwood]
When I was young I was a class clown with glasses
Ya know the type that you could burn mad ass with
Got no romance, I was a joke to look at
So I had to be the funny man like "Who Da Man?"
But on my first day I watched my car breakdown
Had to be missing pounds for petrol
I was petrol, we both had to push the car up the hill
To Kentucky Fried chill
All the people on the bus died laughing
"Ain't that Richard Blackwood, boy you aint mackin"
One day I'm gonna ima make you eat your words
In the back of my mind I heard

[Chorus by singer]
Mama used to say take your time young man
Mama used to say don't you rush to get old
Mama used to say take it in your stride
Live your life(ohhh we love you R baby!)

[Richard Blackwood]
On the comedy section they used to tell me to do what the americans do
According to who???
Is that a real Soul II Soul stay true
And my uncle used to say stay you the brave fool
Now I'm gettin pounds and hugs from the people I checked for
From Birmingham to Brixton and mo
Though I did enough shows, with no dough, 
no podiums and only two people in the coliseum
Cant go from the 1st to the 5th gear
Looking in my rear
Cause I'm bound to hear
(One day when I had you back where's my drink at?)
There you go tap water, Thames Finest
Its only natural from a minus
Who went to a plus
UK, Black bound to bus
Only cause I knew who to trust

[Chorus]
Mama used to say take your time young man
Mama used to say don't you rush to get old
Mama used to say take it in your stride
Live your life

[RB] Say my name bay-bee?
[S] Ohh we love you RB check you everyday on MTV
[RB] Who da man baby-bee?
[S] You da man big boo, no matter what you do we got love for you
[RB] Say my name girlfriend?
[S] Ohh we love you RB check you everyday on MTV
[RB] Who da man bay-bee? Who da man?
[S] You da man
[RB] Who da man?
[S] you da man?

[Richard Blackwood]
Look son if ya wanna front on me
Ima send ya out everyday on MTV
And if you want more Channel 4 know the score
Rollin with the Richard Blackwood Show, where to go?
Sky's the limit
And my light you can't dim it
On the silver screen ima get up in it in a minute
It aint about the beamer of the benz
I wanna raise the UK flag while I lose sense
Whaaaat?

[Singer]
Mama used to saaaay take yooour time young man(What ya say?)
Mama used to saaaay take yooour time (say my name, say my name whaat?)

[Chorus]
Mama used to say take your time young man
Mama used to say don't you rush to get old
Mama used to say take it in your stride
Live your life
