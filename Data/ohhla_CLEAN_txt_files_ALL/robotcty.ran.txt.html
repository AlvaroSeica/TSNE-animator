[Random]
Welcome to your guided tour of Robot City, the birthplace of complacency
The weather is dreary, the system is ever
Meet your first tour guide, Mr. YT Cracker

[YT Cracker]
I'm released from my chamber, stiff from the cryo
Put on my uniform, live in denial
Another drone in stark free zone
Function is one never function alone
Do what they tell me, buy what they sell me
Trapped as a clone please somebody help me
I've been programmed to be like them
Uhh, programmed to behave like them
Remove my implant, black &amp; white golden color
See Robot City in all of its wonder
See the fearful fall in line
To the masses perception of space and time
See the copycats, massive rocks
Your man YT Cracker think outside the box
And Random, generate straight in tandem
Robot City look out, this the anthem

[Chorus: Random]
Welcome to Robot City, where everybody's nobody
And ain't nobody gettin busy just
Fall in line or fall behind
Different day, same thing, we do this all the time

[Jon Bap]
So what's the one thing clones are useful for?
Euphoria or, reproducin who the youth adore
Movie stars or, legends of musical yore
Losin all integrity dealin with Luci-fore

[Random]
Now youse the bore, in white T's long enough to be adressed
My attention span ain't short enough to be impressed with

[Jon Bap]
Clones posin as hair-brained criminals
Swear they's originals, right? (Right, right...)
Swear they scary as DeNiro in "Cape Fear"
In a stero but watered down like grape beer
If ain't clear, it should be apparent then transparent
Fantastically average and just can't bear it
You, blendin in for them Benjamins
Don't even own the skin you in, it's the City, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Random]
I heard a brother say he tryin to stack paper like Doubleday
But when it went down that brother went the other way (pyoom~!)
Yeah another day but just the same as yesterday
Robot City, the place nobody wanna stay
But can't leave cause of fear of the unknown
And stay on your J.O. cause everybody wants clones
Independent thought's gone in the 21st
All you gotta do is bite somebody if you want a verse
And don't mind the radio transmissions
It'll probably be the same song every time you listen
But the styles come highly recommended
And if you think we look alike, I won't get offended
And if you can't afford it, go on and grab the bootleg
But whatever you do, don't drink the Kool-Aid

[Chorus]

Welcome to Robot City...</pre>
