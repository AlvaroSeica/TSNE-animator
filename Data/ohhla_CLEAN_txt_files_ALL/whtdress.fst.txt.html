Just me and you girl, whoa
Just me and you girl, whoa

[Kanye West]
Trynna sneak upstairs, to your apartment, aren't you a sight for red eyes?
I just flew and slipped in on your left side
Dressed in satin gown, you asleep with no makeup
I'm just trynna be inside you before you wake up (Just me and you girl, whoa)
We had problems, but that's all in the past
Everybody got problems, baby, I did that past
Remember I used to do things that'll make you laugh?
Like ordering a girl drink in a matching glass
She liked pina coladas getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl, that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying, on who I bang
We was on fire, but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying, baby, you have changed
Cuz now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips starts switching, you pissed off tripping
Cuz even when we kissing, baby girl, feel different
Friends all diss 'em, like, no he didn't
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping trynna get a pair of Christians?
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say "How's work baby?"
Well, some of the models is coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I'll call you back you say you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demand that they all wait
See, she knew about all my lies, the whole time
And my credit so bad, I can't get no one to co-sign
I would of thought she would of bust through the door crying
But she up and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign, now
She back in the club in a tight dress
With some dreams of some day wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle, that
She would talk to a nigga with a ten year ago swag
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends
Quote on quote, cuz her girlfriends got girlfriends
On the phone, hollerin' at niggas is whatever
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever
Now she headed to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, accept a nigga grown
So I can't bitch and moan in a session getting stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane, a bus and a train
To try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turn the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight, I could picture you in a white dress
Thirty foot train, diamond from Loraine
Just to makeup for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came
Auntie couldn't make, oh no, that's a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer
Took the very last car of the Euro style
Tell the conductor, just drive so far
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited
But we could tour the country side and they won't be invited
We would not be disturbed by the fussing and fighting
Tell Peaches light the Herb cuz we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herbs, go somewhere private
I'm talking just me and you, and a plane and a pilot, uh</pre>
