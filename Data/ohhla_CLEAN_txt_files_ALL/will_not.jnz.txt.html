[Verse One]
My name is Sunspot
Child ov the storm
Make your head knock
I'm the wildest man born
Leave your head torn on some independent shit
That means I'm takin' it home and then I'm countin' my chips
With no lip from the A&amp;R
I'm the star
The CEO, manager
Do my part
For the team we own everything
Together we start
Tape crusading, invading your area
Creatin' hysteria, breaking all barriers
With the power of cyclops
The power of hip hop
It runs through my veins
The power won't stop
Or block
What became
So in my socks I ran angered
Through the rain
Lost in the woods up to
Penny Lane
Where Beatles and The Walrus's 
They maintain
Insight
So like a diamond fight
We run the tunnels
You'll be dropped as quick as a shark bite
To the neck
If you a DJ at night, check
Spin this here
Let's keep the party goin' and break that fear

[The Grouch]
Mark of a man made
Get it paid
The road I walk is not laid in the Earth yet
First set it off in the early
90's
Crusades For Justice on chrome tape finally
Hit your Walkman 
It rocks in the cock stand
Able at least
No fables just speech
From each individual piece of the puzzle
Which makes up the puddle to drown the enemy sound
Defend the ground
Sacred to the state of our take
Now look around
Let's make it cause a chance of fate
I'm feelin' antsy
I'm pullin' in the fancy feast
Grant me peace
I'm buildin' till the ?
Come to take me way and curses haters
? here but I told you it was major
Private, no soldier
It's all in the open
Wrote then recorded again 
To keep 'em scopin'
Hopin' you can see this
Crusades of fetus
Feed us in umbilical 
Heed this
And bring what you got
Do it
Bring what you got

[Chorus] [Sunspot Jonz]
Go on
Try to play it cool
But we, will destroy you
We, will destroy you
We, will destroy you

[Verse Two] [Luckyiam.PSC]
Up in the air, it's a bird, it's a plane
Naw, it's just me
Tape crusadin', Living Legend known as PSC
Faster than a speedin' bullet
Cheatin' all the charts
But ain't got enough mail to pay the biggest disc jocks
Blow up
What's up dunn?
If you like that 
You probably ain't feelin' the way, I'm bustin' this rap
Been to New York two times in my life
And understand why y'all love it so much and that's alright
Cause I'm a tape crusader
I slang 'em in Decatur
Slowed 'em in the Bronx
Kinda wanted to get some trucks
But I made a
Promise to the west coast, long ago
Never would I cheat on her style, she still afloat
I'ma underground pro
Minus Wake Up Show
Even my fans seem to know
Popularity it grows
We rose
Freak my team on the cover of a magazine
And then even up no doe
Cause I'm a tape crusader
I slang 'em in Decatur
Slowed 'em in the Bronx
Said I thought about some trucks
But I made a
Promise to the west coast, long ago
Never would I cheat on her style, she still afloat

[Chorus] [Sunspot Jonz] [x4]
Go on
Try to play it cool
But we will destroy you
We will destroy you
We will destroy you</pre>
