[Intro:]
[Black] Light a match up!
[Short] Bionic, BITCH!!
[Black] She called me out there
[Short] The bitch called me out there, man
[Black] Called me out there
[Short] She tried to get a pimp slipping
[Black] She called me out there
[Short] It ain't nothing but pimping, BITCH!!
[Black] Called me out there
[Short] Yeah, that's right player

[Verse One: Black Silver]
Cool and calm the way a player do
Approach baby doll like; whose you?
What your name is, shorty? - I'm a Navigator
I can ease off the rude to spend some time with later
And my production is always be paid
Some fine dinning, and maybe a little shopping
Let the night do what it do, just me and you
Hit the Jacuzzi and pop a bottle or two
Girl, don't feel shy, you got some model in you
I can have a good time, just following you
She replied; She was feeling me and my plans
She even let me know that she was one of my fans
That's when I know, there's I've seen her before
In one of our shows, standing in the front row
Right before the guards, said she gotta go
Her and a crew of groupies be getting through the back door

[Chorus: Too Short]
She called me out there
The bitch called me out there, man
Called me out there
She tried to get a pimp slipping
She called me out there
It ain't nothing but pimping, BITCH!!
Called me out there
Short Dawg in the motherfucking house

[Verse Two: Too Short]
Way back when I made Freaky Tales
In 1988 - I was freaking girls
And I fucked a lot of groupies in eighty nine
When I started getting famous, if I think she's fine
I'ma hit it, I'm back on the row tomorrow
Another show, pussy is short to follow
But don't bother, cause I don't fuck groupies these days
See me with a bitch, best believe she is paid
And ?? is what, it's not Gold D
Ain't talking about money, don't talk to me (BITCH!!)
And paid dues to thieves, and used to lead
I blew the trees, while she bruised the knees
Let me tell you what happened a few nights go
Met a bad little bitch, tried the life of a whore
I always had to have two wives or more
But I ain't never seen nothing that fine before

[Chorus: Too Short with minor variation]
She called me out there
The bitch called me out there, man
Called me out there
She tried to get a pimp slipping
She called me out there
It ain't nothing but pimping, BITCH!!
Called me out there

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Yes, sometime a pimp can catch your whore out there, man
I caught this bitch out at the park this yesterday
Staring hard at my rims in the Candy Bay
I said: Shut the fuck up! bitch, respect the game
IceBerg Bitch (BITCH!!) respect the name
I said: The only one position you got is your back
The only chance you got in your life is the track
I'ma tell you something; that's a goddamn fact
I'm a motherfucking Pimp and your man is a Simp
The bitch looked at me like a slave set free
I said: Hold up! whore, I need my shoes in feet
I need my track bitch, fat bitch, that's no joke
I don't give a fuck, you gotta fuck the poke
The bitch left that day, came bagged at night
Hundred grand cash, key and snow-white
Looked at a nigga like it was big dough
I said: Back to the track, this is Pimping whore

[Chorus: with major variation]
[Ice-T] I called her out there
[Short] I'm hard on the whore, it ain't nothing but Pimping, BITCH!!
[Ice-T] I called her out there
[Short] Yeah, they know what it is, it ain't nothing but pimping, BITCH!!
[Ice-T] I called her out there
[Short] You better get with it BITCH, it ain't nothing but pimping, BITCH!!
[Ice-T] I called her out there
[Short] She already knows, it ain't nothing but pimping, BITCH!!

[Outro: Too Short]
Yeah, that's right player
And you what? - You know what I say?
Share that bitch nothing, man
And bitch is gonna find out through this pimping, man
Call me out there, BITCH!!
Better catch this Pimping in your ass, BITCH!!
Yeah, what's my favorite word?
That's your new name!</pre>
