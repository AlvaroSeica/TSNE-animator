[Verse 1: Intro]
Can I kick it?! (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it?! (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it?! !Yes you can!)
Well let me kick a little something for my mellow my man (Stanstro!)

[Verse 1]
I am
Ready ready for action
Flow is steady and clear like you read me in caption; I
Crash every gathering with an entrance so grand, kid
The frame may be lacking, but the presence is massive (Bastards!)
Never frail, this slim n!gga will sever scales
This figure I'm given sure assisted your moms well (Aw hell... F'real?)
Don't believe me? Just ask ma
And while you're at it, tell her I fell in love with her hand jobs
("Damn God, you're killing it!") Nah, black just drilling it
And filling it with something so ill
They'll need a penicillin drip from an IV
And a trip to the lobby
Doc with the news saying they might not survive me.

[Hook]
We go hard and we grind all day
Shine while y'all parlay
That's how we do
Thought you knew 
Better make your move (Better make your move!)

We go hard and we grind all day (Hey!)
Shine while y'all parlay
That's how we do
Thought you knew 
Better make your move

[Verse 2: Intro]
Yes yes y'all
And you don't stop
The beat knocks under bars by your boy Savant
And RAREBREED's steady bringing the sure shot (Stan!)
And we're sure to rock ('Stro!)
While your sure drop (Talk to 'em)

[Verse 2]
I suppose you should know I was spawned in the Chi
Now reside in the southwest where I'm ready to thrive
And these bars? No one tests unless they're *Ready To Die*
Send a shout to *Wallace*
The torch is mine (sh!t is mine)
Kick off your shoes and jump off the jock
Cracking God's top 5, it's your boy Savant
I splintered 6 through 10 when "The Lyricist" dropped
Said Mr. Bridges: "I'm coming for that number spot!"

[Bridge]
On the number 1 spot we've called a blitz
Your best bet is to move in accord with this
We go hard with this
Until the dawning hits
And you don't want to trip
So you should go on and make your move

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Intro]
Can I kick it?! (Yes-- Yes you can!)
Can I kick it?! (Yes-- Yes you can!)
Can I kick it?! (Yes-- Yes you can!)
Well I'ma kick it on mo' 'gain my mellow my man (Stanstro!)

[Verse 3]
I am
Ready ready for action
Damnit I'd better be with this keen sonic backing
I'm seeing your head nod
Seeing your feet tap
Seeing your neck bob
Proceeding to be fractured as I
Wax clean over classically stacked beats
See, it's unfeasible to keep your ass in your seats
And unbelievable that you're enamored with me
When I ain't said a damn thang over half of this beat
I'm just casually cruising like a cool, calm stream
You're rabidly grooving like a Ru Paul theme
We do our thing, it's true we're a sharp team
But my flow stands alone like duly starched jeans

[Hook]
