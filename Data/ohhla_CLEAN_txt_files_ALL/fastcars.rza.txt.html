[Intro: RZA]
True mizza-Mast' on the triz-nack
Bob Digi back for a snack
Kinetic 9 in the biz-nack
Raekwon got the triz-nap

[Chorus 2X: RZA &amp; Erica Bryant]
We be ridin' fast cars
Weed all in the glass jar
Chrome all on my crash bar
Glocks all in my stash box

[RZA]
Gats burst off, thugs take their shirts off
Five niggaz drop off, before I got the verse off
Pop go the glock, wipe the fuckin' smirf off
Your face, my bitch pulled up in a lime green and turquoise
SL5, five AMG, while you shoppin' for a deal like it's A&amp;P
On the paper chase, like blood, my thoughts circulate
No caffeine, but the submachine gun will perculate
Rikki Tikki Tavi, ya'll niggaz Duck Daffy
Get fucked like Daphne, stuck like the taxi
Drivin' through the hill at night to the weedspot
I got two hands but I'm known to carry three glocks
B-O-B-B-Y, niggaz see I, only rock the Wu-Wear jeans, not the Levi
Used to break days smokin' coke and digi
'Til I bulked up to the Incredible Hulk like Bill Bixby
Face green, knuckles burst out like Wolverine
Should I rip this bitch pussy or go pull a sting?
Fatal guillotine carrier, boy, ya'll niggaz know me
Wrap niggaz in sheets, fold 'em like the roll singing
Sick silky six syllable stanza
Slap simple sadiddies swine sleazy Samantha
She blowin' up my horn, bitch ain't try'n to answer
Bobby Digital, Zodiac sign: Cancer

[Chorus 2X]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo... yo.. yo..
Yo this is P. Tone, 5 minutes from the Park Hills, Staten Isle
I do bad, only when the Mack good to stay balanced
You shoot me? I shoot you, best bet's to finish me
cuz if not, if I get the chance, I'm do you
Your shit all off the hood, the clips go buckin' me good
The shells get stuck in the wood, Starks is a veteren (uh-huh)
Clarks, jewelry, bitches, jeans, darts is his medicine
Y'all can't build me, your technique's Ecederin
Look, I will take my time in the bushes, right
Paid up people no mind like I'm crooked, right
Shoot a nigga on down, do him somethin' right
He on the floor, tell his grams, "yo I seen the light"
The red car it just pulled off like Un Hall was drivin' the joint
Faster than ya had ya the fifth smokin' lookin' moist
I ain't know what to do so I told the boys
I'm not a sucker look, y'all mothafuckin' made noise

[Chorus 2X]
