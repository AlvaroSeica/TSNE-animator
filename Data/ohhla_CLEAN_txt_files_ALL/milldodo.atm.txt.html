I only act like an asshole
Why don't y'all stand back, let the man grow?
I can't tell what town this is
But I know that bill was a counterfeit
Hey bartender, bump a top jar
I gotta think about where to dump this cop's car
I'm too slick, so fuck your bullshit
I'm cooling in the corner with my custom pool stick
My grand-dad must have played the jazz
When I bleed you hear my heartbeat snap
All around the world, it's the same bar
Wishing that the jukebox had some Gang Starr
State to state, I chase fate
But my stereo ate all my favorite tapes
So baby doll you better straighten up the attitude
or you ain't gon' make it with me all the way to Baton Rouge
Call her mama, she make the milk pour
on ninety-four, too high to read the billboard
Got a room at the best Western
The guy at the front desk look like Les Nessman
Hush now, not a sound
Shut the door and lay a towel down
Y'all run around to figure out what it's all about
while I try to find a cure for this cottonmouth
I keep track of the miles I run
But read the flask that say Southside Son
Took a sip through the hole of my ski mask
Roll till we get to the burbs for the cheap gas
Speed past, millennium dodo
I got my own lane, I don't wait for the popo
So order up another plate of oysters
You talk so much, you making my voice hurt
Dental floss inside of the glove box
Radio locked onto classic rock
With the mirrorball, escape from New York style
Double parked outside of the courthouse
The windchill got a big old butt
My breath fog all the windows up
Take a break from the rotten grapevines
Fill the tank and then spank the state lines

Never make this mountain move
Nah, you're bound to lose
But I knew that I could count on you
Next round's on you (is that you?)
Wash my sins off in the rain
Caught this fish now light that flame
I only claim what's in my veins
That's my crown and that's my name
Gotta wait till they slash the price
'fore you catch a life
But we can spend half the night
with the dashboard light (is that right?)
I'm just saying, if it's all a game
you can hang your pain in the hall of fame
Don't make me explain
That's my crown and that's my name

The pick pockets call me Ali Baba
I'm here to sell you some magic water
You might know me as Jacob and Malcolm's father
Rest in peace Eyedea and Sally Slaughter
It's like that y'all (it's all right maybe)</pre>
