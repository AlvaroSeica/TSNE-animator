Artist: The Grouch f/ Bicasso, Nebulus
Album:  They Don't Have This
Song:   It Means Too Much
Typed by: KingColl98@aol.com

So rough, so tough, out here, baby
(Freedom, what makes a man wanna control another man)
So rough, so tough, out here, baby
(Hatred, tell someone else how to live his life)
So rough, so tough, out here, baby
(Insecurity, are we all free)
So rough, so tough, out here, baby

[The Grouch]
Categorize your own thoughts- I'm gonna freestyle my life
Step where I like and make a print
I'm an inch away from bliss try to catch me but they miss
Im like otherwise, on some other shit
You can't pinpoint or define this
Just highlight and underline this 
I masterminded it
Dont expect me to say it for you 
Show you through the door you can walk now
BFAP show me how, I have mighty strong legs
Extend them long ways, farther than the song plays
Deeper than a hard drive, brain is not a mega hertz
It mega-works, irks the unstable
Try to top my table but you didn't have the centerpiece
I dine on China, fine bone collection
Invite my folks to the supper serve perfection
Now we're all full
Awfully lawful to our own codes of honor
You sold out for a dollar
Somebody else named you a scholar
I had to holler during his moment of silence forgive me there's no science
Defiance? Defy what? Am I a free man?
Shouldn't even question myself- let Grouch be man

[Chorus]
You can't take from me what you can't touch
You can't break from me it means too much
Some people don't realize or just don't give a fuck
This freedom's way too rough, it's way too tough

Can't take from me what you can't touch
You can't break from me it means too much
Some people don't realize or just don't give a fuck
This freedom's way too rough, it's way too tough

[Bicasso]
Freedom is a road seldom traveled by the multitudes
It comes from attitude
Bout ninety percent and the next ten percent wanna say it lies in talent
I mean- the ability to really do what you want
Everyone wants to come off fresh, don't front, but will you?
Im talking about that dream in your head- that thing in you
In your heart that you said you were gonna do when you were like tennn
That's right, stop, think, and remember that shit again
Don't lie cause it's gonna show up, when you try
Freedom is a road with no toll, with no bull, no push and pull
Just a mastery of the let go
So are you experienced or have you ever been experienced?
For a lot of y'all- that's no
But show for yourself, and prove for your move but soon switch
Quit labelin this freedom I got like you thought it was some music
Biatch..

[Chorus]

[Nebulus]
Open, let it all soak in
What's tight, and what's not so
What's right, and what's happenin
Got loaded get grounded
Soon was astounded by the big picture
The all, totality, full range between opposites- duality
Man I'm juiced off that shit and how it applies to me
For the fact that I'm always intact
Can't separate mind states and the way they interact
So with that, shackles disintegrate off the brain
Floodgates open, tasting the joy and pain
Some stay scopin, tryin to live through my escapades
Tryin to categorize, analyze, and put grades on that which simply is
And ain't trippin
Adaptin, flowin, constants will keep flippin
Follow the feelin, dealin with the hearin now
Ready to experience what life will allow
While ignoring the bickering from dudes who document
What I do contradictory, causing an air of agitation
Instead of seein what I'm beein in a situation

Look, look..

[Chorus]

So rough, so tough, out here, baby
So rough, so tough, out here, baby
So rough, so tough, out here, baby
So rough, so tough, out here, baby</pre>
