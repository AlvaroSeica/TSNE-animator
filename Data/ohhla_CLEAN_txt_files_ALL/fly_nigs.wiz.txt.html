Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Young Khalifa, man. How fly
We already a quarter pound in on this one
How are you?
Yeah, we killing these blogs!
You already know my nigga
Ain't no turning back now! This shit on smash

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Influenced by the reefer but I'm still positively speaking
Heading down to New Orleans fuck with Spitta for a weekend
Exotic bitches freakin, minks on the rug
I'm living Cliquot dreams, pouring drinks in the tub
One life to live, so I'm a live it up
Like you gotta pay for pussy, nigga
I don't give a fuck. Blowing awesome new threads
Chickens give me new head
One look at my charm, they say I ain't doing too bad!
My palms itching like you did when you rolled in grass
Flick another joint, I'm here but I just hope it lasts
On the beach with my amoebas smoking hella-Zags
Love the life we lead but we just make a toast and laugh
You say another day, I see it as another plane
Another dollar, another reason to ensure the fame
Every city they repping, they know my name
We the Gang, Taylor painted on the wing

[Chorus: Curren$y]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Fly niggas do fly things
Take the pictures in the Chevy is the song we sing
Kids looking up to me cause I'm a G

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Would it be cliche to start my verse
Saying something that I always say?
The planes got it, I perfected my roll in the sunset
Aeronautics, I swear on my soul I would never cosign
Some nonsense. Muscle car auction, I just cop it
And then go ride it. Wait for the night to set
Then really pop it and drive it. Bitches run on the side of it
Like those little Jamaican kids who saw that benz with Buns and Ox inside it
Word to Wale, Spitta OT in DC for 4 or 5 days
I got enough J's in my? bag
Smelling like a pound, TSA what they looking at?
Wanna pat me down, came up with nothing cousin
Pull away from ground transportation puffin!
Baking kush berry muffins
Mind on a million, trying to get this shit is puzzling
In the grand scheme of things, where you sit in this discussion?

[Chorus]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Fly niggas do fly things
Take the pictures in the Chevy is the song we sing
Kids looking up to me cause I'm a G</pre>
