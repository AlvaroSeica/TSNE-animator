[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Alright, well check it
We found, a friend of us
Straight outta Houston, Texus
He's representing Rap-A-Lot Records and shit
He goes by the name of Devin, Devin the Dude
And we brought him along
Just to sing, a little song for all the ladies out there
LADIES MAKE SOME NOISE!!
Yeah, yo Devin, you gonna do this song for them?
Yeah, bust that.. bust that shit for them

[Devin the Dude]
Hey, hey what do you say?
Tell me have you ever been fucked this way?
Hoo hoo, what you gon' do;

Hee hee, what do you see?
Have you ever saw big nuts like these?
Ho ho, what do you know?
Let me bust one of them and then go
