[Grand Agent]
(Do the math) Do the math
if every rapper shot a rapper and a half
who would hold down the ave?
need regular dudes too
but who wanna do what regualr dudes do?
scrape and grind
who wanna do what regualr dudes do?
take the time to recline and make your mind up
now line up, ones to the left, twos the right
regular dudes is better than loose screws and I'm being polite
when I say "don't get it ucked-up-fay"
hip hop hooray, you got paper to launder
hip hop hooray, paper to squander
I let 'em find ya like someting in Rowanda
you must do it to bother me
cuz I do it for everything it's hittin' for
just a reminder B, yo this is just a reminder B

[Chorus]
Be regular, you just a regular dude man
ain't nobody gone remember you, you just era fuel
So be regualr, you just a regular dude
ain't nobody gone remember you
you just era fuel, be regualr, you just a regular dude
ain't nobody gone remember you, you just era fuel
be regular dude

[Liv L'Raynge]
these killers be spittin' like they headlinin' the bill
truth be told, y'all ain't even got a deal, what's up with that?
and everybody you killed, still living
cuz ya shit ain't real, so come on black
all dem cats is all in ya grill
why you just didn't react and cock back the steel
who was that? flappin' his lips, swearin' he was rich
but this punk kid just on some regular shit

[Chorus]

Emcees should know their limitations, their limitations, emcees should know their limitations
Emcees should know their limitations, their limitations, emcees should know their limitations
Emcees should know their limitations, their limitations, emcees should know their limitations
Emcees should know their limitations, their limitations, emcees should know their limitations

[Chorus]</pre>
