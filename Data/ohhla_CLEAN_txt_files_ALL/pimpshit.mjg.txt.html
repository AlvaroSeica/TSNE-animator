[MJG]
You can count on this pimpin', I got them Budweiser horse women
Black mack, make a rookie divorce pimpin'
I didn't read about it, I was born with it and exercised
First I came with a game plan (what) next I tried it
Now what you know about that money in her snatch
When she promised you that she was givin' you the whole stack
Can't be no lover slash pimp nigga, or a player slash good boy
You either be real or Mr. Goodjoy
Cause ain't no such thing as love at first sight
But it's a such thing that you was on them drugs the first night
It's mandatory for me to appeal to the women
Keep it real with the women, but let them tricks deal with the women
And when you in the field with them women
Watch 'em, they start talkin' love shit stop 'em
Cause ain't no hoe supposed to have no emotions
Her job is to keep a trick broken and hopeless

[Chorus] - X 2
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch

[Eightball]
I bust nuts on the face of slut hoes
And hang at the club with dope dealers and cutthroats
Never been one of them niggaz that would save a hoe
Bitch you know the score, you can get your shit and hit the door
Never slippin', you trippin' if you think you pimpin'
Hoes comin' up if they in front of you strippin'
Trickin', that pussy wet lookin' finger lickin'
Tradin' big faces hopin' you can stick your dick in
And she will do whatever for a dollar bill
Suck dick and lick clit on them X pills
High heels and big thighs make a dick ride
Make a nigga spend a grip and think of plenty lies
Lookin' deep in your eyes and don't mean none of it
I got the pie, you got to work if you want some of this
Where you from bitch, don't nothin' come easily
I got somethin' for you if you got somethin' for me

[Chorus] - X 2
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch

[MJG]
For four and a quarter you can get a hoe and a order
A Barbie doll bitch or a hoe from across the border
A loose bitch, a tight bitch, whatever you like
With the certain group of paint brushin' bitches consider priceless
Nut drinkers, butt spankers, dominatrix
Most ain't really with that rough shit but some can take it
One hundred percent born and bred, pimp type
Hoes make my money off of goin' to bed

[Eightball]
Givin' head, hookin' niggaz like a cigarette
Niggaz plea and pay fees, just to get a hit
Skin tight, with no hair so you can see the clit
White hoes, black hoes and hoes that Hispanic
Pierced tongue feel good when she workin' wood
Platinum Visa, PIN numbers and them check books
Turn it in, help a nigga get a new Benz
Turn out your friend, let me be both of y'all man

[Chorus] - X 3
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch</pre>
