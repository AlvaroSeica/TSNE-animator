[Fes Taylor]
You niggaz ain't gon' do shit to Fes
How could you even fix ya lips to spit that mess?
And might jump off, spit that tech
Oh, you was just rapping, forget I said
Make it happen, you know, if our kids ain't fed
Then we mask and gloves with the ratchet, leave a nigga past tense
My New York accent, Staten, I mastered
S.I., N.Y. flow, took years to craft it
Seat belt fastened, heat melt plastic
Flesh burn fastest, turn a nigga to acids
Dust to dust but I don't push leak
Go see them Stapleton niggaz, make it holla at Squeak
Rhymes the only way I could holla at Tik
Still thugging, walking with revolvers in the street
If I live this way for the rest of my life
Will I take a flight to Heaven or a train to Hell?
Still blowing on that haze, frying my braincells
Put slugs in ya wig, applying like Wayne gel
Honey with fake nails, and weaves like Beyonce
Top Model chicks with a face like Stronjay
I lace bitch niggaz like lingerie
That's 98 cents, it's right across ya face
I had a vision, front cover of The Source, but wait
I could buy my moms a Jag, what a cost it paid
At the studio, I don't oyster bake
My life, had a choice to make, I voiced my fate
A Rolls Royce, nah, this ain't my wedding day
Ring on my finger, I'm engaged to the game (see it, niggaz?)
Married to hip hop, want a nigga get shot
Got it like a gift shop, rocks in my wristwatch
Yea, yea, just watching ya bitch shocked
I'm like a race car driver, make a pitstop
Yea, get my dick whopped, plus nigga, I get gwop
Armor car style like my niggaz making Brinks stop
You think not?  Pink pussy, pink fox
I'm a great wolf, fuck 'em on sink tops
You blink, ox right to ya voicebox
Son, you a boy scout, me, I had to hoist rocks
Get ya weight up, homey, I learn to need more spots
Grab you by the throat, step on ya Reeboks

[Outro: Fes Taylor]
Yea, right on ya toes, nigga
It's Taylor 2 Fly, Two 4 War Entertainment
