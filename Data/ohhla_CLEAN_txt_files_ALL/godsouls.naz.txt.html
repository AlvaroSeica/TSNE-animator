[Bronze Nazareth]
God of souls guard mine
I've spent my divine time being in a small crime
In the streets, even though my life is fining
I'm chasing high men, lining and latex protection
Fourty porcelain of correction
Got away with so much 'cause of an intelligence
I drink the innocence's potion
Devoting my bodily motion, the inner high oceans
Hoping that it wouldn't be the words chosen to represent me
I felt guilty when my vast death friends was empty
Read the Bible seriously but the Devil still tempts me
I'd say I lived my life religiously but anxiously
SomethingÂ’s get to me, the soldier with the stab wound it won't bleed
But the pain is in me, I'm sorry God for my offendments
But I do have many attempts to avoid the wrath of Satan
Given 24 hours to live; I'd spend 'em all praying
And spraying the word of God; but that's the whole problem
How can you pray when you know your life is already in disarray?
From now on I'm gon' pray when I'm happy
And thank God for my mishappening's 'cause that's how he teaches you and me
I now see the mountains I've climbed that seem so sharp at the top
My hands are cut and the bleeding just won't stop
When ever I've wandered there always seemed to be that light
But now the roads that I've traveled it just don't seem too bright
It's shallow feeling inside as I grow from young buck to young man
As I hallucinate and seeing crucifix nails in my hand
And I know its craze, to meet the faith without pray
The quiet one; this nigga never gang-bang or join cults
My only fault was sex and simple thoughts
To send my belief to every man by this disc caught
The path I've traveled I feel with jagged gravel
So I growl and write a poetic novel, judge me 'cause upon you

(Hook) {Backbone of Goodie Mob from "I Refuse Limitation"}
"Lord knows I do wrong"
"Lord knows I do wrong"
"Lord knows I do wrong"
"Lord knows I do wrong"

[Kevlaar 7]
Wisdom's swaysy from the ways of wicked men
Fools despise wisdom and discipline, negativity follows to him
The Supreme Being; all I seen the way of the wickedest deep darkness
Or a gleam of daunt to the path of the righteous
Nigga I ain't in no way near perfect, but I note that I'm forgiven
So when I step outside and look to the sky and thank God I'm living
My ways are in full view, a hundred and forty-four thousand
All from the Tribes of Israel; Proverbs in my sides at all times
Due to the best to follow the righteous mind
The path's less taking, I awaken to find my mind's forsaking
But I'ma takes control soon
Laying in the depths of understanding these room
The beauty path just might lead you to the tomb
DAMN! It ain't no room, can't even turn back and make changes
While I was living I should of given praises where praise's due
You wear a crucifix around your neck while he's looking up at you
The Lord is disappointed 'cause you're sending two; the chosen sons
Doing our best to serve the highest One

(Hook) {Backbone of Goodie Mob from "I Refuse Limitation"}
"Lord knows I do wrong"
"Lord knows I do wrong"
"Lord knows I do wrong"
"Lord knows I do wrong"

[Bronze Nazareth]
They say the world is cold but temperatures come from source
Seems like people have no remorse, or is it that I'm too soft?
To face the realities that come with life
I've studied with no evail
And every step I take is one further from hell
I've often let God carry me and hope I live fairly
Though the company you keep is scary
And to not know where our stay is a hopeless situation
Why must I miss this nigga Timothy when the weight on my heart is so heavenly?
Some things I love that cause sins though I'm trying to live heavenly
But every where I go there's attempts to put Devil in me
I'm lost and hopeless and don't know which way to turn
So I refuse any offers to succeed
I guess my life has turned to a fading memory
So now they got me drinking Kool-Aid and brandy
Smoking black and mildness' not even me
The secretion slowly starting to control me
And if I don't wake up soon I'll die alone
Only thing I have is this rap
So it wouldn't matter if I got clapped
At least not right now; 'cause I don't even give a fuck
Sometimes I'd rather be in jail then facing this hard luck
'Cause there I don't have to worry about where I'm headed
Out here my futures dreaded
Whether a moment or I just missed this part of my life
I wonder if I suffer from nuclear bombs that's trife
I just can't get away from the pain this world has placed
So I write shit down to get away, to get away, yeah

(Kevlaar 7 reciting a Psalm passage)
Dear Lord take this pain away and help me carry your guidance
Satan, get thee behind me; I heard your footsteps
I search for Jesus to help my conquest
When I thought you left and abandoned me
I know see the one set of footprints was the times you've carried me

(Bronze Nazareth reciting Psalm 69 KJV.)
Save me, O Lord; for the waters have come in unto my soul
I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing:
I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me
I am weary of my crying: my throat is dry:
mine eyes fail while I wait for my God</pre>
