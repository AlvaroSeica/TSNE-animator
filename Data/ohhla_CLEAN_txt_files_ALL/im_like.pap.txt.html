[Intro]:
Sound like it's gonan be a cold winter, dress warm
I got 'em.....Papoose, Pa-poose

[Chorus]:
I'm gettin money everyday 'cause I'm like that
I wear my jewelry anyway 'cause I'm like that
I drive a Cadillac truck 'cause I'm like that
I don't give a flyin fuck 'cause I'm like that
That dude ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that 
That nigga ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that
THEY AIIIIIIIGGHHHHHHTTTTTTTTT!!!!!

[Verse One]:
I'm like that.......
Everywhere I go I bring me a nice strap
Niggas talk fly until they get highjacked
It happen now I ain't gotta come right back
Man I'm like that, I'm like that
I hustle hard 'til I make me a nice rack
Spend it on new sneakers and fly hats
You live once you don't get your life back
Man I'm like that, I'm like that
Brooklyn is way worst than Iraq
Go to the blocks where they ride that five at
And ask all the gangstas where the dice at?!
Man I'm like that, I'm like that
Your man corny, he ain't nice like that
Damn I wish I could bring my wife back
'Cause she a real bitch, that bitch was like that

[Chorus]:
I'm gettin money everyday 'cause I'm like that
I wear my jewelry anyway 'cause I'm like that
I drive a Cadillac truck 'cause I'm like that
I don't give a flyin fuck 'cause I'm like that
That dude ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that 
That nigga ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that
THEY AIIIIIIIGGHHHHHHTTTTTTTTT!!!!!

[Verse Two]:
I'm like that.......
I used to be a jackboy before I rapped
Violate the jukes don't even try that
You want your jewels back you gotta buy it back
Man I'm like that, I'm like that
I thought you said your man get real right black
I seen you when you got caught in that mice trap
You couldn't take the pressure 'cause you ain't like that
Man I'm like that, I'm like that
My cousin 'gon get that 18 and life back
When he write me a letter I write back
Your man write you, you don't send him a kite back
'Cause you ain't like that, I'm like that
Poke him up then I take my knife back
Wish I could bring my man Ike back
He was a real nigga, that nigga was like that

[Chorus]:
I'm gettin money everyday 'cause I'm like that
I wear my jewelry anyway 'cause I'm like that
I drive a Cadillac truck 'cause I'm like that
I don't give a flyin fuck 'cause I'm like that
That dude ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that 
That nigga ain't like that, he ain't like that
They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that
THEY AIIIIIIIGGHHHHHHTTTTTTTTT!!!!!</pre>
