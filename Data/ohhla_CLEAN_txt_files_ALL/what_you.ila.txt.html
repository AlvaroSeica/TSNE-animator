[Intro]
Wussup whatchu' be about nigga?

[Verse 1L EC Illa]
For about as long (long) as I can remember...
From January on (on) through to December...
Mothafuckas in Chi-Town been bangin
They had they little blocks and you could find 'em all hangin'
The year was eighty-one del plain to broadway, Vice Lord's and Eagle's
Scrappin in broad day, I heard this broad say call the cops
They swingin bats and chains, and they throwin rocks
And that was as bad as it got back then
No one was servin' blows, pullin' glocks or mac-10's
So I kept to myself amongst the pimpin' and hoin'
Gang population consistantly growin'
Years went by, that shit got tight
Half my homies went left and the otha' half right
Despite all the past, they heads got swole
And with the increase in age came the loss of control
We all knew betta' but some didn't care
Like, fuck tha next man I'ma get my fair share
And with that came the shootin and sellin
And in the grade-school hallways you could hear 'em all yellin'

[Hook - repeat 2X]
Whatcha be about? Whatcha be about?
Some, some dudes are People, Some dudes are Folks

[Verse 2: EC Illa]
Now age 16 came and everyone had dropped out
And as far as beef goes, getting knocked out
Was coo 'cause you could have got shanked, or blasted
In chi-town the gang bangin all had been mastered
At last it was all just too far gone
The year was 89 and it would'nt be long
'Til shit got as bad as it could get
Cause with no conscience yo there's no regret
False flaggin techniques, were being perfected
And fist to fist combat, had long been neglected
Infected by the plague, of crazy ass shorty's
Doing more dirt than men, in their thirty's and forty's
The more these kids did, the more they wanted to do
And if you got to catch a slug, hope that it's a twenty-two
Cause survivin' now'days is a task, so you best know what to tell 'em when 
they ask...

[Hook - repeat 2X]
Whatcha be about? Whatcha be about?
Some, some dudes are People, Some dudes are Folks

[Verse 3: EC Illa]
Now the present day is in effect and I can't walk down the street
Without some type of shit to put marks in retreat
Cause these set's got the addicts, actin dramatic
And in the summer time, yo it's even more spurradic
Cause heat makes marks straight tameless (uh)
And all thing's considered shit's gettin outrageous
New set's poppin up like every otha day
Mothafuckas claimin shit, cause they know no otha way
Second flip this sign, or hear a poppin sound
I'm like I can't throw it up, let alone throw it down
I done lost track on who's who and what's what
So to simplify shit, I be layin in the cut
While my homie's out raisin hell cappin shit
I'm creatin it my rest with this rappin' shit
But if you thinkin' you can hide than you dreamin
'Cause just chillin in my crib I can still hear 'em screamin'

[Hook - repeat 2X]
Whatcha be about? Whatcha be about?
Some, some dudes are People, Some dudes are Folks
