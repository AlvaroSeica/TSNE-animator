[Mariah Carey]
Everytime, I feel the beat
I envision you, on the one's and two's
in the DJ booth, I just want Funkmaster
to rock the set, play it on and on for me Flex..

[The League]
Yo, aiyyo come through, Flex on the one two's in the Tunnel
Peepin for Sax so we can creep it on the humble
Beams and triples, kitted whips and chicks flock the scene
Jake barricadin the spot, tryin to stop my team

Front of the line a few crips just throwin up signs
To the bouncers it's all real if you checkin for nines
I got a dimebag a Dutch a few foes and nuff rhymes
You holdin up lines, I breeze through and snatch up the dimes

Specific with mine, I'm Basic like Sharon within a Instinct
I mix drinks, and polly with chicks that keep they shit thick
and script ink, name with the number to get our clicks linked
I quick think, before you can blink, I'm on the next chick

Shot of Henny in my right hand, stumblin while I'm scopin
While Flex spins the plat hits, gettin them bitches open
in back of the bar, dime shorties actin like stars
After the party them same dimes is packed in the car
So what's the deal Ma?

Everytime, I feel the beat
I envision you, on the one's and two's
in the DJ booth, I just want Funkmaster
to rock the set, play it on and on for me Flex..</pre>
