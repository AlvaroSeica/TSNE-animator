Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Years-years-years ago my mother used to say to me
'In this world Elwood' she- she always called me Elwood
'In this world Elwood, you must be oh so smart, or oh so pleasant.'
Well for years I was smart; I recommend pleasant
You may quote me

If I'd known there was love like this I'd-a grabbed a fucking scalpel
I'd-a slit my wrists in the goddamn delivery room
Hell I'd-a jumped back in the womb
love be the shit that's gonna seal my doom

jj-jj-jj- just cause you made our bed doesn't mean you had to lie in it
look me in the eye sayin together till we die and shit
well feel my fuckin pulse cause I ain't fucking dead yet
listen close does it echo through your headset?
when we first met, I didn't know what I was doing
and I guess yo were sick of that girl's boyfriend you were screwing
instead of thinking in my head were you worth perusing
I shoulda looked into your eyes and seen a storm was brewing
but you needed a new angle so you intercepted my life line
I must admit you were looking good so i granted you my time
behind every acute angle you find an obtuse one
as a hand caressed my thigh over my head a fresh noose hung
but this one I thought maybe I could trust her
we'd grown close over time I though maybe I'd sussed her
I threw my heart shaped anchor with all the strength i could muster
it fell short and ripped up the hard seabed up in clusters
but that didn't phase me, I just kept on going
with my chest ripped open and my heart still showing
i was naive like that, see my mind was still groing
I thought with trust and persistence that the love would start flowing
but it didn't so I pushed and pushed to invoke
new levels of love but instead we just broke
at that point you chose to let me in
and that's where all the problems began to begin

[x2] If I'd known there was love like this
I'd-a grabbed a fucking scalpel
I'd-a slit my wrists in the goddamn delivery room
Hell I'd-a jumped back in the womb
love be the shit that's gonna seal my doom [x2]

now just suppose I was to juxtapose my soft right cheek against your nose
would you look me in the eyes and fall in love like the T.V. shows?
or maybe if I took a rose with an envelope with a note enclosed
that said our love inside me like a flower grows
would it really make any fucking difference? cause it shouldn't
would you sell yourself for one cheap gesture?
cause I couldn't and I wouldn't
I know that's all it'd take to win you back
but I ain't looking to soil my shoes on such a well trodden track
so you can take your love by numbers and put it up on the rack
just impose your shit and baggage on some other mindless hack
now just suppose I was to juxtapose my tightened fist against your nose
releasing blood with color deeper than the deepest rose
releasing streams of anger that we all have yet no one shows
release me from the fucking chains of heartbreak that you sill impose
and that'd be wrong and I ain't gonna do it
but there ain't no harm in putting this plot in my mind and walking through it
so fuck you for still spending time with my friends
and fuck them for not knowing what's appropriate and when
and it's fuck up that all the good times seem to blend
into one big fucking mess from the beginning to the end
so take a good look at my face
and you'll see that this little smile seems outta place
now go ahead and look closer but I'll never let you trace
the tracks of my tears

[x3] If I'd known there was love like this
I'd-a grabbed a fucking scalpel
I'd-a slit my wrists in the goddamn delivery room
Hell I'd-a jumped back in the womb
love be the shit that's gonna seal my doom [x3]</pre>
