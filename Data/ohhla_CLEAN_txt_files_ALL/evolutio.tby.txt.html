evolutionary 

[Toby]
when your back's against the wall 
and your hope turns to faith 
you better be able to evolve 
to survive another day 

can you hear it in the distant breeze? 
listen to the infants breathing 
sounds like a symphony 
the instant that the instruments hit their peak 
we know that history teaches 
all the wars won and the victory speeches 
but what's hid beneath 
every shift towards reason is traditions breaching 
letting go without getting paralyzed 
being careful not to parrot lies 
that your parents might have shared 
cause they inherited a paradigm 
where they're unaware that time 
will find a way to verify 
the very things that vary in each pair of eyes 
rolling a pair of dice trying to find your paradise 
watching as your era dies 

[Chorus]
we are tomorrow 
we are the dream 
we are the whispers 
that the choirs will sing 
we are the moment 
the cycles are broken 
so walk with me (so walk with me)

evolutionary 

[Toby]
all revolutions become the establishment 
lost amongst all the management 
and a newborn's breath 
will hopefully move forward a few more steps 
than a freshman who barely 
just read a paragraph 
of Marx's Manifesto and get so they wear 
dreads, dressed in apparel 
with a picture on the chest of Ernesto Guevara 
the other side interested in scaring 
the rest of us here with a message of fear 
so todays questions appear 
through the lens of yesterday's perception of fair 
and the prejudice clear 
whenever they're debating on who gets to be married 
always saying to protect the kids 
really they're afraid we'll reject their myths 

[Chorus]
we are tomorrow 
we are the dream 
we are the whispers 
that the choirs will sing 
we are the moment 
the cycles are broken 
so walk with me (so walk with me)

evolving where I can 
trying to grow as an artist and a man
