[Cap N1ne]
Yea, what
bangin', yea

[Cap N1ne: Verse 1]
I stay busy with the life that I choose to live
Wanna have enough money to feed my to grandkids
Have a couple albums underneath my belt
Certified five mics &amp; a double x l
Do it like I am, big name collabs
On an all star team, but I'm first at bat
I burn the track, just like a pyromaniac
Insane on the beats man &amp; that's a fact
I spit game, listen real closely
If you wanna know the way to approach me
Get money or trade me a service
If you wack, then you really don't deserve it
Gotta work it, flow till you get sick
It's either that two ways or you get rich
Don't act like you don't know what I'm sayin'
You could tell that I'm deep already spit enough game

[Chorus (2x)]
Stay grinding, twenty-four seven three six five
Open shop in the back of the ride
Stay grinding, cause the game don't wait
Focus on the pay, every second of the day

[Stomper: Verse 2]
Well I'mma stay on the grind, like the homie Cap N1ne
Get my money from the game, getting paid for my rhyme
I get my scrilla with the nine, I ain't trying to do time
Stuck a swisha with the con and I'm a hustla for mine
Cowards talk about money, but their money is funny
Somebody tell the little homie ain't no taking it from me (I get money)
I'm the first on the block, a fat pocket full of rock
and I'm strapped with the glock
A curb swervin, lane swervin, blunt burnin' balla
Shot calla, they call me godfather
A big boss, watch me floss, you'll get tossed
Twenty-two's on the big body running the block
Posted up at the spot, got whatever you want
You want that window or rock
You want the caine or the pot
Come right with the cash, pull the leno and spark it
I grind daily homie on the south side black market

[Chorus (2x)]
Stay grinding, twenty-four seven three six five
Open shop in the back of the ride
Stay grinding, cause the game don't wait
Focus on the pay, every second of the day

[Open Verse]

[Chorus (4x)]
Stay grinding, twenty-four seven three six five
Open shop in the back of the ride
Stay grinding, cause the game don't wait
Focus on the pay, every second of the day

[Cap N1ne]
Grindin'!</pre>
