Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Damn
Girl I know exactly where to throw
You a pro every time you hit the pole
I love it when you take it to the top
Drop, and stop it right before you hit the floor
Drop, drop, and stop it right before you hit the floor
I love it when you take it to the top
Drop, and stop it right before you hit the floor

[Kid Ink]
Ohh, what oh, tell me how how, tell me how high high you can go oh
Ass like cocoa, move that thang slow mo
Alumni bitch, I know you can see the logo
Uhh, its just me and all my money
Ones, tens, twenties, fi fifty's, hundoes
See me sittin front row
Now keep moving round like a jumprope
And I'mma keep pourin the shots, den smoke
Gone, take it straight to the ceiling
And po pop a couple bottles
Fuck a two drink minimum
One named suga, and a girl named cinnamon
Think its bout that time, red lights, stop signs

[Chorus]
Damn
Girl I know exactly where to throw
You a pro every time you hit the pole
I love it when you take it to the top
Drop, and stop it right before you hit the floor
Drop, drop, and stop it right before you hit the floor
I love it when you take it to the top
Drop, and stop it right before you hit the floor

[Tyga]
Ugh, bitch be professional come get this money
I just keep it one hundred, they bring my change in twenties
Post it where its sunny, suntan bitches naked on me
Ain't no cuffer, ain't no police
Just this pole dancer in front me AYE
I love how she fuck in the morning
I love how she look when she on it
Tongue in the air when she moaning
And we do it late night like conan
Rollin, probably half of a pill with sum of that molly
Here some desani, rippin tha taste up out of your mouth
Now taste my boner w- warm, is your interest into other women
W- would you, like to be a partner in this orgy
Oh no he, didn't, yes I did, even got your friend in it
Ain't no shame in my game ya dig
I keep hoes hangin like candy canes, Aye Aye

[Chorus]
Now,
Girl I know exactly where to throw
You a pro every time you hit the pole
I love it when you take it to the top
Drop, and stop it right before you hit the floor
Drop, drop, and stop it right before you hit the floor
I love it when you take it to the top
Drop, and stop it right before you hit the floor

[2 Chainz]
2 Chainzzzzzzzzz
Stop drop and pop it, I like it wens its sloppy
Wet wet, mop it like that vanilla and that chocolate
When she pop it, I pop bands
Ball so hard nigga marching band
Ball so hard then cheerleaders
And I'm high, SUMMER CAMP
Tru REALigion up on dat
Ralph Lauren underwear
Niggas kno that I'm underground
Put in over time, now im out there
Two chains, I'm turn it up
Ride around and I burn one
Ride around my side of town on 22s but I'm on one
Put ya girl up on one, make sure its a long one
Up and down and round and round
Got one chain and I clone one
Everything is on my run
2 Chainz, I got tall guns
One on first, one on second, one on third, HOMERUN!

[Chorus]
Now,
Girl I know exactly where to throw
You a pro every time you hit the pole
I love it when you take it to the top
Drop, and stop it right before you hit the floor

Drop, and stop it right before you hit the flow</pre>
