[Intro: mc chris]
Hey guys, you ever fall in love?
When I first saw you and you looked into my eyes
I knew, right then and right there
that I had fallen head over heels
That's when I knew I had to ask you out on a
What they call it Lee Majors?
Help me out, one time

[Chorus]
First date, you're lookin great tonight
I think that I might take a chance tonight
First date you're lookin great toniiiiight

[mc chris]
Hold all the doors for you, pull out chairs for you
Nobody cares for you, like I do, like I do
Clip my nails for you, chop off the tails for you
Well I don't know you, but I feel like I do

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
I'll buy you popcorn, I'll buy you Coke
We go outside and, sniff and smoke
I make a joke and you laugh like it's funny
Girlfriend you're straight up money

[Chorus]
