[Intro/Chorus: Chris Brown]
I be goin ham
I be goin crazy
I be goin hard, hard enough to have a baby
They go, "OH!" and tell me I'm amazing
They go, "OH!" and tell me I'm amazing
'Cause I be goin ham
I be goin crazy
I be goin hard, hard enough to have a baby
They go, "OH!" and tell me I'm amazing
They go, "OH!" and tell me I'm amazing
Oh...

[David Banner]
She said she headed my way, Pronto
Come up to the pent house Suite, Condo
She only come over to get bathed, Bongo
Come tonight, Stay until the morning, Alonzo
She said she tryna come, can I assist, Rondo
Headed to the bedroom? Nah, Follow
She like a wack rapper, no spit, Swallow
She told me I'm the best &amp; I respond, "(Yeah) I know."
That's sort of like my motto
See it in her eye a little fear, Madam
Hop up in my pushback seat, Fantom
It only happens for a small few, No random
Now let me shoot it in your Mariah, Cannon

[Chorus]

[Chris Brown]
Oh...
Hey Lil' Mama, won't ya freak some?
You &amp; your girlfriend together, that's a threesome
You are my sex slave, don't want your freedom
We do it over and over, Here we come (repeat)

[Chorus]

[David Banner]
Yeah, baby
Hop up in my sweet front seat, Mercedes
I know that you had couple drinks, faded
Said she feelin good, let me, make it
Better than it was; so what you think, later?
You could meet me at my hotel suite, naked
She was like "Nah" I'm like {*PSH*} "Better take it"
So used to being regular
She don't understand, a man ten steps ahead of her!
Yeah, I can change your decimal
I'm your lottery ticket
Have you scratching like eczema
She seeing lights like a signal
And I'm asking, "What ya all up on me for?"
Cause we go...

[Chorus]</pre>
