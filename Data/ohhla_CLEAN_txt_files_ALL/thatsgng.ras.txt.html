[Intro: Ras Kass]
Yeah ah ah Yeah Is ya with me
what up y'all forget me y'all love y'all don't love me no more it's all good
all are real roudy niggaz all my real niggaz ride with your boy one time

[Verse One: Ras Kass]
Lyrically I smoke who ever it may concern
Even wearing a twenty one milligram pack a nigga derm
Been broke before ain't nuttin new
But ain't nuttin ever new me not to say fuck you
So have my nuts not grew
I would still hang in the streets with little niggaz who is to bangish to eat
Bang with the heat the water proof spit blazes
To give y'all niggaz business like the yellow pages
Enter the dark ages, inteds, spark stages for what ever wages
Untill I am famous for resurection on hated language
And still the same shit different toilet
See the game ain't talented (unt uh) it's a battle scandle in it
And now them same clowns made at it (pimp game)
But go figure lyricsist of the year is a white boy
and greatest godfather is a huge nigga

[Chorus: Ras Kass]
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on debt ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no mother fucking west without a r-a-s
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on debt ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no mother fucking west without a r-a-s

[Verse Two: Ras Kass]
I was forced to rhyme undeniably and force niggaz to think
So if you need to dance so fucking much then buy N'Sync
Start a movement to move in motavation
of millimeter mantra repeat you need a monster
Me I be the aqua, "Waterproof" got a lot of truth
bitch slaughter a lot of groups
Rhyming without a clue, not off without loot
Black out like Caligula just a nigga that
clown with a sucidial groupie in the jacuzzi pullin my shorts down
Givin me underwater head 'til I nut and she drowned
How the fuck we sound (man rap is out of control I got to smoke son)
Yo homie bust me down
Took a pull of a new port and passed it back
Nuts hang like a had an elastic sack
Splash the gats if I find a classic clapse
Wanna know the reason why white people seem to laugh at blacks
Cause brothers in south africa slaving to death in diamond mines
Mean while we spending every penny to over shine
Tell the next nigga he lesser cause he can't afford to buy ice from his opresser
So I ain't pulling out nines willing the homicide need of mine
Mean while George W. Bush got a war on crime
(*matrix sample*)
Introduction to the matrix
I say the shit you know is true but you wanna ignore metanor metaphor

[Chorus: Ras Kass + Kurupt]
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on debt ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no mother fucking west without a r-a-s
And that's gangsta without bangin the set
Big nuts on debt ain't even hangin'em yet
See it's just some things they should never forget
Ain't no  west without kurupt with a r-a-s

Don't forget yeah big ass posted
r-r-ras kass nigga r-r-ras kass nigga r-r- west coast</pre>
