[Intro: KM.G whispering]
Ugh, in the house, check it out
Above the Law, ATL, player, tell me where you at hah?
Above the Law gang, A.T.L, where you at hah?
Pimp Clinic Gang, where you at hah?
Mad beats pumpin, where you at hah?
That's what they say do hah?

[Verse 1: KM.G]
Diggin' their groom when they gang beat into the room
Sippin' on thick Hennessey consume
Yeah, we're comin' through, ready to dance with the devil in the pale roomlight
Gays kind of mad cause bang kind of tight
See, that the feelin, how chill and bake a quater in the Westside
For a nigga to get fly, tricks on some hookin' let him steal a gram
Visit my whores to get sucked up
I'm the man, lookin' for this other mothafucker
Me and my game, he wanna get wicked
He wanna take it there, dumpin' browns any time I G-up
Yeah, I'll be the mothafucker, to straight see ya
So pass the letter to the mail, Hands Up!
I just got a fax at the Shack in my ride
And now, they sent me on my pager
Two chickens got stuck, someone's playin' with paper
All of a sudden, I had to sent the homie
The big homie, the pistol Whip, pistol whipped the whole clique
Because we didn't benefittin' game
Known Above the Law got to keep the name
Maintained, stayin' away from them One Times
Cause we're pistol grippers, and them turkey could be trippin'
Bad unique uniform
Plus, the NARCs come through like some mothafuckin' quite storm
All we have to do is stay more aware
I'm about to flow in the the studio, bump a whore and go
And stay strapped all the time
Put that L-neezie I'ma get rhyme, toss a gang of crimes
So now you know, what we go through, the evil shit that real men do

[Chorus: various overvoices with somewhat scary music different than were in the verses]
Real men do
Evil that men do
Evil that real men do
Evil that men do
Evil that men do

[Verse 2: Cold 187Um]
Now, roll me up some of that good feelin'
So I can forget all the shit on the news that I'm hearin'
I got other things to do with my life
I give a fuck if OJ killed the demon killers right
Cause I be around a million mothafuckers a day
Just ready to peel your cap back for lookin' the wrong way
I got that problem with myself, and my mind is playin' tricks on me
Am I gettin' fucked with my homies? 
Or is my lady fuckin' everybody in the hood?
I hope not, because her pussy is good
Yo, I roll through with my Nino on lap cocked
Just for the suckers on the set that wanna cock block
They get dropped like that last player hater
I swear, I come raw like the jaws on the alligator
Now, all let your homies and all of your friends
Quit tryin' to put your buster ass back together again
But if not, I'm at your way, ready to shake you some more shit
If that's I did, the busy gotta get
Cause y'all peep, I was raised on the rough side, hussy
The Who-Ride, The either get rode on
I'm gettin' tired the mothafuckers playin' sheriff royalty
Storm me up, and tryin' to put soft all on me
I give them 50 feet, with the Infra Red on the tech set
Boo yaa, kill them with no regrets 
I once knew a nigga named Sami, who had it goin' on in Miami
Now, Sami got popped by the Feds like a bitch, so we snitched on his whole fuckin' family
Now, who that? who that? who that, all up in the collate?
Who don't even know what the flavor look like
Yo, I be the C-O-L-D-187, A-B-O-V-E-T-H-E-L-A-W
It's the crew, wicked like Voo Doo
Yeah, with that evil that men do, fool

[Chorus: various overvoices with somewhat scary music different than were in the verses]
Real men do
Evil that men do
Evil that real men do
Evil that men do
Evil that men do</pre>
