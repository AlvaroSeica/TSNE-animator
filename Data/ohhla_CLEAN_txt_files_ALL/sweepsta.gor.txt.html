Pay day, you're a winner...
Pay day, you're a winner
Keep cool form a line
Scared money, broke money
Bow money mo' money
So sunny, cloud breaker
Sound make a wave run-up
Wild motherfunky drummer
You can get it how you wanna
There's math and there's dealers then players then me
They say that they're winners, okay, well, let's see
You play there you play
The rules of the trade
The math of the days
The times and the age
But you want how you like
Aim high, man, why not?
Sun, moon, and starry y'alls
Each and all of y'alls
Mathematics and dealers then players then me
They say that they're winners, okay, well, let's see...

Sweepstakes! Sweepstakes! You're a winner
Sweepstakes! You're a winner
Sweepstakes! You're a winner
Sweepstakes! You're a winner
Sweepstakes! You're a winner
Sweepstakes! Sweepstakes! You're a winner

"Who's the winner," said the dealer
Every player "Yeah, me!"
So you say, "We will see"
Player play, hey, ok
