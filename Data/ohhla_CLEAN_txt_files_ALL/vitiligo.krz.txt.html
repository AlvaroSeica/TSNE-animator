I grew up a young cryboy
Christian like Krizz is like the last you ever think to pick a fight
Kids used to throw rocks at me
when the bus stops at me
houses would come running out
Leave my brother alone, she would tell em
I'ma kill em momma, if they send him home again yelling
I'ma erase at least one of em from this place
I hated they make fun of him cuz his face
Go on and on, travellin on through adolescence
Teach em a lesson, carry a weapon
cuz thats the only way to keep em off of me
They teasin me awfully bad
I wish I could take of my mask and I'm asking my momma
why you think the lord seen it fit to hit me with this
He could make a different Krizz, if he wanted to
Here's what I'm gonna do... I'ma tattoo my face and erase this
This is Vitiligo

What kind of life is that for a boy who looks like this? (Famous)
Wanting to fade in this world, but it's just a wish
What you feelin? People whisper. Silhouette of a lonely figure
(What can he do?) Where can he hide? Livin inside of this Vitiligo

Save this... freak of...nature songbird...  Make his way from...

From the bottom all the way to the top
Even though he hate the way he painted, momma told me I can't stop
Cause no one cares. If anyones watching
People stare at mister Watson
But that never stopped him from coppin the vodkas
and was popular
Its over and shit
Colder the older it get
Sorry pop never made it to see his son be the great one
Escape from the place that definitely made him
Look what I did, I made a life, a wife, and a kid
People know me wherever I go
This is Vitiligo

What kind of life is that for a boy who looks like this? (Famous)
Wanting to fade in this world, but it's just a wish
What you feelin? People whisper. Silhouette of a lonely figure
(What can he do?) Where can he hide? Livin inside of this Vitiligo</pre>
