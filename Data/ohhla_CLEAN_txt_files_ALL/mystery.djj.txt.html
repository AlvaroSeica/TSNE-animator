Bounce wit me y'all (LE)
Bounce wit em y'all

Now check it
Who get it live when the party dies down
Mysterious man showing up in your town
Lyrics like lightning, vocals like thunder
Neighborhood success or the overnight wonder
Uh, precise on mics but nice with the toe-to-toe
A roll big flow, shows out in Kosovo
Between flows and chasing them hoes
I make the crowd get down like its supposed to go
Get down year round glad to see y'all came
In the summertime banging at the b-ball came
In the wintertime kickin rhymes up at my block
With an L in one hand and a cup of hot chocolate
A man for all seasons damn I'm raw even
We set the bar high everybody start reaching, cause.

(chorus)
Who said I couldn't get it down like this
Some tried to get it but they got it like this
Put you in a mix, get your body the twist
Its the mystery man, that the fans cant resist

Six sold M-K-T playin the corner
Ice cold Colt 45, not Corona
Get down see me on the prowl now I'm gonna
Holla at this fine young girl named Sherona
See, morons stalk, I walk right up on her
And make her heart race like the Dodge Daytona
Tired of the neighborhood guys hey hold up
How's she get that good lovin feeling when I show up
Down and ride wit me, don't forget me when you blow up
How you gonna walk away from this, sis slow up
The head games is over ma I'm for real
Your ain't Oprah and I'm not Dr.Phil
Despite your size and them serious thighs
The long eyelashes and mysterious eyes
It don't pay to stay away from mysterious guys
That get the girls on the floor and keep the party alive, cause yo..

Chorus (x2)

Now if I wanted I could pump it in every club this week
But I pass cause it only adds to my mystique
If ya think that I'm weak then catch me out in the street
It aint nothing to show me homie man we got this heat
That nigga that got all y'all waitin
To get off the wall and get the bar room shakin
I came to but the party under a rest
And if they like it in the hood, let it pump in the jets
Mystery man, never take my mask off
But when it comes to the raps I can act y'all
Non-stop flow that might flood the dance hall
Peace I'm out, be easy I get at y'all
