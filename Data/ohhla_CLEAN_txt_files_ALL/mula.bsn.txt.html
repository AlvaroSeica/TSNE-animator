[Intro - Big Sean]
(G.O.O.D.) After God, after my family, I ain't gon' front
Ain't nothing more important than this success, than getting it

[Bridge - Big Sean w/ ad-libs]
Where my real niggas, that's gon' ride for me
Where my fine freaks, that's gon' ride for me
Where my real niggas, that's gon' ride for me
Where my fine freaks, that's gon' ride for me

[Chorus - Big Sean]
Ain't nothin' more important than the mula!
Ain't nothin' more important than the mula!
Hallelujah! (Hallelujah!), Hallelujah! (Hallelujah!)
Praise God! (Praise God!), Hallelujah! (Hallelujah!)

[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
Tell the police, I'ma stack this paper 'til I overdose (Boi)
Whoa-di, ho-di, slowly back yo bitch ass up, you over-close (Boi)
I over flow, all over hoes, my niggas is over-hype
Shooting up your Phantom, now they call your shit the Holy ghost
(Whoo!) M-M-Mercy, Lord would you please have mercy
And protect me from the hoes, if her life ain't sweet, they gon' desert me
Shut the fuck up, and stand up when you see me, like I'm the verdict
That's respect, now I got your wifey, and you back to using that Jergens
Hurting, sipping, spilling, tipping, for my niggas who done passed way
Charge yo' ass a 'fuck you fee', and make you pay your tax today
I'm on a secluded island, swear it feel like castaway (God!)
Put that money in my shooter hands, and tell him blast away (I do!)
I feel like getting paper is my destinnnny (Boi)
Â‘Til I rest in peace (boi), get money recipe
Told my mind get what you want, then just leave the rest to meeeee
(Money, money) Ain't no motherfucking rest for me (Boi)

[Chorus x2] w/ ad-libs

[Verse 2 - French Montana]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula (Haanh!)
Diamand rings, hundred chains, Slick Rick the ruler
I got polished cribs all in my name, got them M's all in that bank
Griff, Blake all in that paint, stacking bread, come watch me plank
Haanh!... Pray to never dying broke
Getting cases by the boat, went shopping, buy the store
Shorty snorkel for that crab, eating lobster on my dinner plate
Stacking all this money homie, tryna see that ceiling break
Mula ain't everything homie, it's the only thing
Came from a hall of piss, straight to the +Hall of Fame+
Talk money, we got it (got it!), fuck boy, shoot your stylist (sytlist!)
Eating good, I ain't brolic, I'm just chasing them commas (Haanh!)
My niggas rock that five, and my bitch a ten
Got that China white, call it Jeremy Lin
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
My chain, a fridge, deep freezer, and a cooler

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge - Big Sean]
Where my real niggas, that's gon' ride for me
Where my fine freaks, that's gon' ride for me
Where my real niggas, that's gon' ride for me
Where my fine freaks, fine freaks, fine freaks...</pre>
