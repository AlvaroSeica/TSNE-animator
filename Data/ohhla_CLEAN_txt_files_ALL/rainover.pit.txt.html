Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: Marc Anthony]
Girl my body don't lie, I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm risin so high, out of my mind
So let it rain over me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay, let it rain over me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay, let it rain over me

[Pitbull]
A billion's the new million, Stoli's the new vodka
40's the new 30 and baby you a rockstar
Dale veterana, que tu sabe
Mas de la cuenta, no te hagas
Teach me baby, or better yet
Freak me baby, yes yes
I'm freaky baby
I'ma make sure that your peach feels peachy baby
No bougie broads
I like my women sexy, classy, sassy
Powerful, yes
They love to get a little, nasty, oww~!
This ain't a game, you'll see
You can put the blame on me
Dale munequita ahora ahi
And let it rain over me

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
A billion's the new million and Stoli's the new vodka
Latin's the new majority, ya tu sabe
Next step, la casa o blanca
No hay carro, no vamo en balsa
Mami you know the drill
They won't know what I got 'til they read the will
I ain't tryin, I ain't tryin to keep it real
I'm tryin to keep wealth and that's for real
Pero mira que tu estas buena
Y mira que tu estas dura
Baby no me hables mas
Y tiramelo mami chula
No games you'll see
You can put the blame on me
Dale munequita ahora ahi
And let it rain over me

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide, Marc Anthony, tu sabe
I was playin with her, she was playin with me
Next thing you know, we were playin with three like
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I was playin with her, she was playin with me
Next thing you know, we were playin with three like
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Rain over me

[Chorus]

[Outro: Marc Anthony]
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay, let it rain over me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay, let it rain over me</pre>
