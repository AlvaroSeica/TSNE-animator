Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm smoking all this reefer, fucking with the strippers
I'll make that ass clap, I'm coming for your tippers
Yes I need you to fuck my nigga on pillas
I'm a drug dealer ho, I'm coming for realer
The thrill in Manilla, stayin be here my strippers
She was up on the dance floor now she on the asphalt
Bitch go ahead and shake your money maker
My bitch for the paper, in the cuffs see my neighbor
Bitch shake your ass harder, I get round in that Charger
I'm gon see you tomorrow, shake your ass for the cash
Bitch get down low, bitch get down low
Bitch get down low, bitch get down low
Man these real hoes make it click click in the club
I'm talkin money off the ground, takin 50 in them debs
You can call me a scrub but I'm all about my cape
I'm a beat the whole ass, they get goin rick n lake

I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho
I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho
I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho
I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho
I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho
I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho

Bitch throw that skirt, no head, no twerp
This just like work, this just like work
And you gonna make that stir, bitch just like to flirt
I'm a beat to this ho, I'm a beat the broke ho
Don't know? Now you know
Face full of smoke
Make a ho go broke, shakin ass to the floor
I can if these hoes, bitch I'm gonna pay fair
Shakin ass on me, throwin cash on me
Bitch call me T-Pain, meet the bitch on the plane
Perkin ass all day, bitch I hate that guy
Bitch I know Lil Wayne, take the ho down low
I know the based God, how low can you go?
Can you clap those sheets? Bring it down on me
Gotta beat my bitch, club night â we gon eat
Bitch I know you a freak
Twerk it all on me
Ass shakin, don't stop
I keep it live on the streets bitch

I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho
I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho
I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho
I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho
I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho
I'm a beat my ho, I'm a beat my ho</pre>
