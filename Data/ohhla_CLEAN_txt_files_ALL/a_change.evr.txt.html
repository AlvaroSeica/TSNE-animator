[Everlast]
I was born, by the river, in a little tent
And just like that river, I've been runnin ever since
It's been a long... long time comin
But I know yes I know, a change gon' come, yes it will
It's too hard livin, and I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there, beyond the sky
It's been a long... long time comin
But I knowww, a change gon' come, yes it will
I go to the movie, and I go downtown
Somebody keep tellin me, don't hang around
It's been a long... long time comin
But I knowww, a change gon' come, yes it will
And then I go and I see my brother
I ask brother won't you help me please?
And he winds up, knockin me
back down on my knees
There were times, that I thought, I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able, to carry on
It's been a long... long time comin
But I know yes I know, a change gon' come, yes it will
It's been a long... long time comin
But I knowww, the change gon' come, yes it will
It's been a long... long time comin
But I know yes I know, a change gon' come, yes it will</pre>
