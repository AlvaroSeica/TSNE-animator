I hide behind the curtain listening to whispers with my fingers cross
I got 2 little sisters to think about
In the event that ghosts appears
I'm told I'm supposed to hear a signal when the coast is clear
But I'm alone in this room and it scares me
To start, I'm having second thoughts and it tears me apart
Hold on to my breath for dear life, feeling confused yet
Still enthusiastic about the sound of music
Join me please </pre>
