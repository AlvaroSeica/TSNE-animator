(1st verse)
This for you groupies who knew me
Or better yet who done crossed me
I toss a coin to your life
'cause ain't no hata gon' stop me
A quarter mile we done ran but I can keep up on feet 
We platnum bound on you clowns
But still we loved on these streets
A rough rida most likely with lubricated rap tight
In it to win it the beginning and the end
Thats life
Never last cause I'm first
901 puttin' my work
I think it hurts for this verse
Stop poking me cause it hurts
Now I done took all I can my granny stays on my ass
With regulations and rules without my moms and dads
And plus my kids gotta eat thats why my freedom must speak
Gon keep me 10 toes and knees untill I'm soaked up in cheese
And to my enemies choke a slug and to my slang bang flowwers
Keep on showin love untill you next up or you catch up on the t-u-b
Cause we gon represent untill the day they bury me

(2nd verse)
This for you jacks who be hatin'
Who wanna play in my station
I land a standing ovation
Cause im down with the nation
A tay away in the shocka
Make a sucka get hotta
Fly gon do what I gotta
To melt you lemons like lobba
If you can stand like a man
then fly gon give you chance
But since you cant so flizi aint
and me a gansta a hand
We trackin trizack for track
We pop with love on our back
We wakin' shakin' mind is makin'
And we aint turnin' back
With adversarys out platnum
Fat pockets out fatten 'em
Gold and silver may be nearer
But we planin' on platnum
You pinchin' up on the strip
I pinch the blood from my lips
And fly don't dig what they done dug
But that dont mean I ain't hip
I let my enemy slip
I take advantage of error
My territory forever
With hammers cocked back with terror
Minny may mafia
with taylor baby to tough nobody needed nobody
And we aint fuckin' with cuz
So could you keep to yourself
Cause we ain't sick in no health
This playa's family and this Gangstar
All this playas got left
And I cant be sellin' them out
For a bigger car and a house
You keep that shit in your pocket cause I've been doin' with out
YOU BITCHES

(Chorus: repeat 4x)
Nobody needs nobody
all I need is me and my dog
niggas so fuck all of yall niggas

(3rd verse)
Back nigga who it but betta I get more chettah then cheddar
I take the wu out of tang and a g-rated sounds betta
I drain more harder then draino kick you harder then Kano
Take the life out the living for all you suckas that follow
See tomorrow got more then Arab stockin' in store
I take the B out of blow so you can hit it some more
They say we vicious like pits, so quick to get in yo shit
And when she click on the trick
you like I'm lovin this shit
We havin' fun with this one
You see the look on my son
You know what daddy done done
Done turned some trix with some crum
I got enough on the needy
And if you like me come meet me
and if you dont, dont come to me
You might be leavin' the dump
Rack up and toughen the cut
When lil fly step on your gut
We see your facial expression
If you must lose You'll get buck
But see you all tied up and cried out
But we still dirty south fried up and bumpin out
It aint no doubt many clout what you shout ?
Hide your mouth
Playa fly gangsta B Gangsta weed and we out
And we out

(4th verse)
I rather please you then tease you
Please dont make me decease you
I believe instead of having you dead
I rather lyrically beat you
Have you heard of the sign
And see some shame in your eye
And when you "b" hit the street
You got the shitty look now
And you cant wash it away
Cause on your face it will stay
Fly done gone off on the south
So get the fuck out my way
And flizi dusting you rascals
Who constantly giving me hassles
Graduated wit game
So to the right turn my tassal
When them playas from South Parkway
Funking smoking plenty phi
Aint no love shown but to those who down till we die
Down don't stop us
In the crowd we be rocking
A lot of place causing quakes
And many twizzles we dropping
We aint taking violations
We taking over the planet
You rather be crossing your bosses
Then fucking with a playa goddamn it
I be in it to win it before you 'bout it
Im out
And I be in to the finish
And I've been doing without
YOU BITCHES

(Chorus repeat to fade)</pre>
