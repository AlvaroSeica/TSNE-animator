Come on

[ VERSE 1: Psycho Les ]
I don't trust thugs, I bust slugs
I need a gangsta bitch that loves rough love
That drinks alcohol and blows up drugs
I'm stompin you out, leavin you in scuffed Lugz
What the fuck is y'all cryin about?
Bottles at the bar, I'm buyin em out
Hookers on the dancefloor, I'm tryin em out
Doin things in the club you should only try in the house
(Watch out now) I never have to line up
Or even pay admission to go in a night club
I'm Lester and must be calm, never hyped up
VIP drinkin Henny like what (what) (what) (what)
Ain't no stoppin these
Muthafuckin Nuts that be choppin beats
Blow a million bucks on a shoppin spree
Y'all bitches better duck when I cock and squeeze
Plow!

[ CHORUS: JuJu (2X) ]
Cause we can do it
However you want
Flip flows or pop those, kid
Whenever you want
Beats, beef, or both, son
However you want
Psych and Ju bring the joint, kid
Whenever you want

[ VERSE 2: JuJu ]
Yo, you better duck when you see me comin
Better run to your drug when you see me comin
No time for horse play, my force spray right at your neck
Respect when the boss say I'm a threat
No games, I'm business, get it correct
You know I bought a lot of guns since "Reign of the Tec"
Regardless, my only concern is progress
Leavin all y'all monkey-ass producers jobless
I'm hungry, man, maybe like never before
Bigger and better shows every tour
More money, more hoes, I don't need no problem
Some rap nigga get out of line, we gon' rob him
Have a nigga terrified to be in the street
Man, don't make me have to verify niggas is sweet
Come on homie, I just want a piece of the pie
Any man get in the way of that, he gon' die

[ CHORUS (3X) ]

(Intoxicated)
However you want
Yeah, New York niggas
Whenever you want
(West Coast)
Word, huh
However you want
All the burroughs, baby
Whenever you want
Get that paper
However you want
Beatnuts bring the joints
Whenever you want
Prepare
However you want
Whenever you want
Huh?</pre>
