[Intro: 50 Cent]
Uhh, yeah, ha ha

[Chorus: 50 Cent] + (Snoop Dogg)
I'm tryin to move one brick, two bricks, three bricks, four, more, more, more
I'm tryin to move five bricks, ten bricks, twenty bricks raw, boy, boy, boy
(I smoke one ounce starin at the Caddy on the showroom floor, floor, floor)
(Now I'm tryin to move five pounds, ten pounds, twenty pounds more, boy, boy, boy)

[50 Cent]
Run tell the Bloods I'm Crip'n, go tell the Crips I'm Blood
Nigga I be trippin, bitch I don't give a fuck
I put the K on niggaz, I spray on niggaz
Come through 2012, XJ on niggaz!
I'm a apex predator, nigga I'm strollin
Shooters on deck, I break bread and they own me
Niggaz said I fell off, oh you heard I fell off
Why the fuck would you be repeatin that?
Nigga I'm a rap tycoon, make 100 mil' by June
Now who the fuck said I can't rap, Jack?
I'm in a dopefiend's dream, I got it for 'em raw
I got the morphine memories, 'cept I'm breakin the law
I was born a problem, in a stroller with the llama
I'm violent, I kill a nigga, put that on my momma
Nah nah, don't tell me nothin 'bout none of these niggaz
I'll smoke ALL these niggaz for this bread

[Chrous]

[Snoop Dogg]
I give a fuck about a Fed as I jump up outta bed
Five pounds, ten pounds, twenty pounds, yeah!
I'm tryin to put this shit away
On the low I need a hit a day, think you better get away
from my, oh my, I got a bernie that'll fire
From Cali to Kingston, back to N.Y.
Snoop's master kush, fo'-five to nine
Come by and get you some pounds and now you're flyin high
Run with the metal with my foot to the pedal
G's with the trees and the C's on my level
5-0, you know I go hard, these fools caught me Bogard
Head nigga in charge, these niggaz soft as DeBarge
But I ain't trippin, I'm just flippin my cheese
Cause if you really want the bomb come and fuck with yo' G's
I got it, always kill, always will
Had dat, sit dat, my nigga get dat, you hear dat?

[Chorus] w/ Young Jeezy ad libs

[Young Jeezy]
5 AM in the kitchen nigga I'm coughin
Bag full of white 8-balls, I'm going golfin
Now homie got killed last night, bought him a coffin
Retaliated the same night, made him a dolphin
Ah~! Guess that's the life of a yay flipper
Chopper make ya ass get naked just like a stripper
Got cameras for the jackers, home invaders man
Them niggaz come in all black like they Raiders fans
All I saw growin up was kilos and gangbangin
Then the homie taught me to whip, game changin
Now I'm breakin down birds on the coffee table
Yeah, and half them bitches sold 'fore they off the table
Gotta look, nigga wantin my half, I'm gon' split it
The type of nigga work that visit like it's a skillet
Less soda more water, stretchin like it's elastic
Weigh it up in, 250's, wrap it in plastic, yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro: Snoop]
Yeah, you know what it is
It's your Crip'n cousin 5-0
Anytime you need that motherfuckin smoke you know I got it cuz
You need five pounds, ten pounds, twenty pounds?
Whatever you need you know I got it
And if them niggaz out there in the N.Y. need it
You're my connect so I can hook them niggaz up with that uhh
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee, I'm tryin to move this shit cuz
For real though, I got too much of this shit homie
Yeah, I'm Bob Marley reincarnated
YEA! Rastafari</pre>
