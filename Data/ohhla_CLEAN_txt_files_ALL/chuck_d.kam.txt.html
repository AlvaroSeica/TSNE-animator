[Chief Kamachi]
Got a letter from the government, tore it to shreds
Come and get me, burn a donut shop down full of FEDS
Wire tap my temples, face on the WANTED LIST
I talk power to the people with a blunted list
Pay back, crack the shackles on the hundred wrist
Hurt, Mother Earth lookin' for a son to kiss
Got my light back shining on one abyss
Bullet proof auras, every single gun I miss
Life, that ain't something that you wanna risk
I'm back, dressed in a black why come to this?
One, two, mic check, Sun Tzu
Runaway slave in the jungle wearing one shoe
I am the body that great leaders can come to
Neck loose from every noose that they hung through
Can't touch us, bunch of dead klu klux's 
Chronic masonic, let's puff a few dutches
Mach!

Welcome to the Terrordome
It's still zone red cross burn my lung
Pull it through a comb head
Stand on my square, step on a sucker toes
Black Fred Flint locks full of water buffalos
Gorilla palms, it ain't hard to crush your rose
Young Tut, soul strut, freshest clothes
I radiate something outta '88
AK assault bank vault get the baby cake
My wife a queen I ain't scared to say my lady great
Spin the nine planets, goddammit! Crazy rate
Nat Turner don't wanna be a crack earner
Godbody, historical fat learner
House niggas, Uncle Tom janitors
I'm in the lab with the pen like Ben Banneker
Cure for AIDS in the West African cannister
The killing fields, cannon ball banish ya
Mach!

[Chief Kamachi]
Fight the power, Spike Lee strike three
Hundred years in the hole won't ever see a life free
Ham sandwich waterdown ice tea
Fuck the law, concrete wall nothing the sight see
Grudges with Supreme court judges
Autograph pictures for families saying they love us
Next time they see us we're buried under the covers
Hell in the back they supply my brother
Have the candle light visual when reviving mother
Half the night afterlife tryna discover
Back to school again, live by the laws of the hooligans
Mach no one do it like Young Dulligan
Street preacher, pole pit a dirty curb
I'm 720 you're barely a 33rd
Great men, Malcolm Little from the state pen
Angelic but I use to be a straight jin
Mach!
