[Verse One: Mac Miller]
The youngin' yo, wherein' his jeans low
Chillin' with Vinnie and Beedie killin' this premo
*Scratching*
The youngin' yo, wherein' his jeans low
Chillin' with Vinnie and Beedie...
*Scratching*
The youngin' yo, wherein' his jeans low
Chillin' with Vinnie and Beedie killin' this premo
Ill spoken basically I got that mean flow...
*Scratching*
The youngin' yo, wherein' his jeans low
Chillin' with Vinnie and Beedie killin' this premo (You know)
Ill spoken basically I got that mean flow
I make it hot like you puttin' on three coats
I spit remarkably where words actin' hard to see
Spark the tree grab the pen and pad and just start the beat
Cuz I'm just tryin (Cheew Cheew) right some shit
Light a spliff, get high cuz life's a bitch
So we had nights of mischief pittin' piff flippin' zips
A fist of chips takin' they cats out the licorice
I'm all skills no name no nothin'
Game don't care the flame no chain no lovin'
See, you spit fire EZ Mac's got that blue flame
I'm heated, weeded, ready to do thangs
This shit amazes me, thought I had a new brain
And feelin' this dudes game is too plain
By the Boom Bang!
Cats thinkin' they can hang
Got yourself a gun now cats thinkin' they can slang
I kick knowledge at those who need to learn
And I spit fire towards the Emcee's who need to burn
Burn baby burn, its the baby's turn
Crazy spittin' rabies aids be words
Spreadin' sickness, sprayin' germs (germs, germs)
Yeeeah and thats how it goes
In case you haven't heard before (What?)
Now you know

[Verse Two: Beedie]
Ay yo, I move on tracks like trains
And drop jewls on tracks like chains
Let a fat sack relax my brain
I attack tracks with a flat my name
Bitches kickin' classic cuz thats my name
From the bread I am leavin' cats Posturpedic flat
As Beedie gettin' cheezy its simple as EZ Mac
The Ill spoken on the come up still smokin' when the blunt's done
Cuz we that fire with a ass on one
I hope you cat's just rap for fun
Cuz we run laps around ya tracks
Faster than the Nascar runs
I just wanna smash somethin' with the ass on plumps
Splash fast watchin' Mash reruns
Its a Coke and Rum
Hip hop ya hope has come
How High gettin more playin' time than the culture son
Known as Vinnie the truth
Sure as 151 and I'll give 'em the proof
So Beedie give 'em the proof

[Verse Three: Beedie]
On the mic I flip bars
Like Dominique Dawes
I'm on the hunt to get yours
I kinda need to floss
Gotta be the boss these other rappers is soft
Like toilet tissue, so official I'm feelin' the sauce (What up!?)
I'm in the club man but ain't nobody heard about me
I'm in a pair Air Nike's and a dirty white tee
I see a couple cuties and they lookin' at me
Could it be I'm sippin' Vodka mixed with purple Hi-C
Sippin' and spillin' fixin' the feelin' look I'm as sick as villens
Whillin' at the bar without a proper ID
I'll be the underage the rains person with rays
It's ready to rip your heart out I feel it up in my veins
(It's me) Vinnie and Mac spittin' plenty of crack
Gimme a sack Im'ma flip to a penny a pack
So, (hoe) who really don't track my train never stops
Leavin' marks and scars on the mic, sizzlin' hot ya dig?</pre>
