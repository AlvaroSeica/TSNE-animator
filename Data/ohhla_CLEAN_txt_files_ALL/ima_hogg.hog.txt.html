[Hook - 2x]
(I'm a Hogg), I'm out that H-Town Texas where the Outlawz hang
We braided and grilled out, that's the Outlaw thang
(I'm a Hogg), a lot of boys try to jack us where Outlawz slang
Ain't no love, cause you can't dub a Outlaw mayn

[PJ]
I got work, I ain't broke no mo'
I call shots, I ain't gotta touch dope no mo'
Candy cars on chrome, cause I hustle for that
Respected highly in the streets, cause I struggle for that
Give a fuck about a slut, I got plenty of them
Been real way befo', I started running with Slim
Niggaz all on my dick, cause they hoes like that
Stay true to the game, cause I roll like that
I'm a Hogg in this game, cause I rep the shit
Hard times jail time, I done felt the shit
Long as they print money, I'ma get me some scrill
If I keep rap hustling, I'ma get me some mills
I was born for this shit, I'ma stay on my game
Keep shaking fake niggaz, I'ma stay on my chain
To the homies dead and gone, I'ma ball for y'all
Hit the boulevard hurting, I'ma crawl for y'all cause I'm a Hogg

[Hook - 2x]

[Slim Thug]
I'm a Hogg nigga, Texas outlaw nigga
Do this shit brawl, y'all soft I'm a Boss nigga
Y'all dick riders, following the crowds
I make the motherfucking rules, ball or fall
Said fuck waiting in line, and took my time to shine
If I ain't get it with my grind, I would of got it with the nine
Left weak niggaz behind, head to the top fuck secondary
I'ma win this shit, by any means necessary
Y'all niggaz scary, my blood clear of fear
This drip sweat, these eyes don't shed tears
You gon respect this here, or get rolled over
I'm the Boss Hogg Outlaw, top soldier
And I'll fold ya, for fucking with my fam
Niggaz better start ducking, when I'm bucking out the Ram
I don't give a damn, and I mean it when I scream it
True raw dog Hogg, y'all bitch niggaz dreaming

[Hook - 2x]

[J-Dawg]
We ride we don't walk we groove, we don't talk we move
Like S that costs a lot of step like
If anything, my Hoggs just step up
Catch me in the middle of a war, with my sets up
Rep repping, soldier boy stepping
Salute when you see me, H.C.G.
H-A-7, L-O-Z G.C.P.
Grooving till the world stop moving, O.S.C.
Boss Hogg Young Hogg, sto' down capo
H-Town rider, got that fire like a vato
Stay strapped up, leave em slipping but I'm not dumb
Keep that heater tucked, like a sucker with a bad hump
A bad bitch, kinda like my bitch
Mine don't fucking lay down, she just bust and shit
I think you lying hoe, you must be sick
That's a saws off gauge, while you wash my dick
