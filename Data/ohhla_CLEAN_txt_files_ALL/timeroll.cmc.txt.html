[Intro: Champ MC]
Cheah haha, check it out, check it out, check it out
Like this ya'll, fuck the bullshit on the real, on the real ya'll
The greatest ??? of '94, like this ya'll

[Champ MC]
It was Friday night, time to call up my peeps
Got the key to my jeep, now my crew's rolling deep
My man just stopped to get a twenty sack
A six pack, I'm Swayzie, I'm cool like that
Then I'm buggin out and having fun
Smoking blunt after blunt, snappin on everyone
Just cruisin down the way with the boomin system
Just ??? to death and pass that izm
Because I'm rollin with the MGBs
Not sellin keys, but my man is making gs
I do business on my solo
Pull into the ave, here comes five o
Can I see some lisence or registration
Hurry the hell up cuz I'm running out of patience
I gave him the info, he lte me go
He was mad as hell cuz I was running out of Enzo

[Interlude: Champ MC]
Know what I'm sayin? Let's go get that fat sack bag
Know what I'm sayin? Get some money and some phillies
Roll them up and spark them up, and go get some more, you know what I'm sayin?
Aight, check it out ya'll

[Champ MC]
We took a trip to 155th and 8th
And I ??? with Ski and threw the duece up to Ron G
We stopped to get a bite to eat on 125
Keepin it live, get out of line and kick it to our people
They offered to smoke and we took a toke and it was lethal
Cheah, and now we're high as hell
So leave me alone, hey hey, leave me alone
We done packin a ride, doin something phat
Ayo honey, can you tell me where the party's at
It's located on the local side of 14th
We can roll back to back in the fat jeep
I know we parlay, cruisin on the highway
Smokin em out, snappin a forty and gettin mad naughty
Pull up to the ??? room and it was all that
The place was packed and the show was mad phat

[Interlude: Champ MC]
Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it
Check it

[Champ MC]
And now we're on our way back to the grand sight
I'm mad tight, smokin an endo, jammin all night
Partying and buggin out with my peeps
It's about six o'clock and I can't wait to get some sleep
We got like half an hour to go
Pockets fat to death with dough, ain't this a bad ho
Riding down the block, doing ninety
Had me pullin ??? right beside me
He beeped his horn,trying to get my digits
Didn't pay him no mind, I was on a business trip
Ten blocks away and I was wishin we was closer to home
Becuase my mind is in a dead zone
Crazy, booted out, now I'm out of beer
All there is to do is get some sleep kid
I had fun, it's getting light, time to motivate
It's an everyday thing, we like to do it on a daily basis
Get the endo, the blunts, cuz it's never gone
Put it in my pocket and save it for later
And I'm waiting till the early morning, call my crew
Ayo g, whatchu wanna do?

[Outro: Champ MC]
Check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Yo grab the ls, tuck the forties
Get your crew, come get naughty
Shit, stay on it, all prudent and shit, word up
Gotta play the DL, the DL...</pre>
