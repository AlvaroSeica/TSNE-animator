[Verse One: Lil' Fame]
Follow me as I g walk on the pavement I, clear the flem
Hawk on the pavement New York's most dangerous
(M.O.P.!!!) You know, the Brownsville wranglers
Since one nine nine trey we supplied y'all bangers
I be rockin them beats Will.i.am not
No funny clothes and shit, I compose the shit
First off I birthed y'all told y'all how to eat
Patted y'all back to burp y'all now I gotta murk y'all
Fame put in work y'all that nigga the truth in the booth
I go hard like caterpillar boots
Another 50 MC's, 48 of 'em 
Already got pineboxes made for them Somebody pray for them 
(BRRRRRR BONG BONG!!!!) I ain't fuckin with you haters
I sent fire to you Tony Touch 'em with the fader
(*Tony Touch Scratchin) Now who ridin with us?
Motherfuckers ain't collidin with us It's M.O It's M.O.!!!

[Chorus: Lil' Fame] (Tony Touch) (*Billy Danze &amp; Lil' Fame)
(Yeah! Yeah!) You know you love this shit (*OH!!!) 
Fuck a hater my nigga we does this shit (*OH!!!)
We regulate it and we dug this shit (*OH!!!)
Got the gun boys drippin up and shit (*IT'S M.O.!!!!)
(SAY WHAT!!!) You know you love this shit (*OH!!!) 
Fuck a hater my nigga we does this shit (*OH!!!)
We regulate it and we dug this shit (*OH!!!)
Got the gun boys drippin up and shit (*OH!!!)

[Verse Two: Billy Danze]
We wrap circles around you clown niggas
Brownsville I get real as official pound niggas
Boriquas in The Bronx officially down with us
They cold niggas in the fold getters
Idolized by spitters, y'all remember me?
(LEGEND!) M.O.P The fiftieth mc
Virgo, birth dog, Billy or B.D.
From the Gang Starr bus we bumpin you flashin
So when I ease through this motherfucker, y'all better kneel
If you killers wanna work today, y'all gotta chill
I'm good in any hood, I'm like a diplonat lil' homie
Better find a extra safety before you gat you don't know me
I'm the reason the ghetto's attractive
And my story's not a urban legend you bastard I'm active
I'm rapidly at this immaculate rap shit
(BONG!!!) To the back of your head and that's it

[Chorus: Lil' Fame] (Tony Touch) (*Billy Danze &amp; Lil' Fame)
(**IT'S M.O.!!!!) (Yeah!) You know you love this shit (*OH!!!) 
Fuck a hater my nigga we does this shit (*OH!!!)
We regulate it and we dug this shit (*OH!!!)
Got the gun boys drippin up and shit (*IT'S M.O.!!!!)
(SAY WHAT!!!) You know you love this shit (*OH!!!) 
Fuck a hater my nigga we does this shit (*OH!!!)
We regulate it and we dug this shit (*OH!!!)
Got the gun boys drippin up and shit (*OH!!!)
