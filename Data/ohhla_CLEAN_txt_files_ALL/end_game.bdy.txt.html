[Intro: Ice-T]
I was reading the news the other day, they called me a Gangster
I've never robbed to starve the entire countries
I've never committed genocide, on entire races of people 
I've never dropped my bombs and killed innocent women and children
Whose the fucking GANGSTER?!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
The End Game motherfucker get your shit tight
Shit right, listen, it's a mission to keep us in the dark
Keep us apart, keep us throwing poisonous darts
Enter the black room, cash rules everything son
Nobody's your friend, fool, go for your guns
Trust no one, money buys souls and lives
Brothers and wives, alibis, many will die
Fucking with the quick to get you niggaz
Demons from hell!

[Chorus]
Their rooms are oval, their plan is global
They make pawns of men, in the name of god they keep us apart
I don't know about you but I don't hate as much as they do
I'm just trying to live and shit
Motherfuckers best pray that they don't blow us all away
WHO? WHO? - The power hungry fools on the hill
Before they lose they'll push the fucking button
Explode the air! - Winter and black rain, they play The End Game

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Motherfuckers take what they can take, motherfucking snakes
They stole this land we live on, and kill to keep
Then they lied in the school books and rocked us to sleep
We're just lambs here waiting for the blood bath baby
Hitman army, Hitman Navy
Moved by the wicked hands of money not love
No one knows the secrets, it's an evil mix man
Hold your breath pray for death, that's the only truth left

[Chorus:]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I ain't never done shit to your country of fame
Don't want your oil man, don't want your land
The people that your beefing with are not my friends
They hate me too, and they want me to hate you
It's the evilest of mixes keep the people twisted
Power mongers on earth, they trade life for dirt
It ain't the people of this planet, it's the kings and their courts
And they do what they gotta do cause murder's their sport

[Chorus: X2]</pre>
