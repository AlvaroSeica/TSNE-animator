[Intro: Petey Pablo]
Yeah it's a struggle in this life
Sometimes, people around the world can't understand the struggle
But if you were born in the country
Then you know, everything I'm talkin 'bout

[Interlude: Layzie Bone] + (Petey Pablo)
Bone, Bone Bone Bone Bone (heyyy) {*7X*}
Bone, Bone Bone Bone (heyyyyy)

[Chorus: Petey Pablo]
I've been locked outdoors (do') out in the cold (cold)
In the streets, belly of the beast, no place to go (go)
Rabid like a dog (dog) tryin to, get on (get on)
Charge a nigga next to nothin FOR 16 BARS!
Y'ALL, don't hear me though; Y'ALL, don't feel me though
Y'ALL, don't understand the intensity of my role
It's a struggle, struggle, to survive
It's a struggle, struggle, in this life, of mine!

[Layzie Bone]
It's a struggle out here mayne
Tell 'em Petey, it's real out here

See a nigga from the G-H-,E-T-T-O
where the niggaz slung dope in the snow, fo' sho'
In the city that I'm from niggaz go for broke
This Cleveland nigga, what you ain't know?
I'm in the concrete jungle, we can do it we can rumble
Take it to the hood and make your whole clique crumble
All I ever see was heavy smoke in the air
They got me bustin off shots like I just don't care
In the hood like a muh'fucker, always had to struggle mayne
Always been a winner though I never knock the hustle game
Some of them niggaz they'll never change
Bounce back with a hit like a nigga made of rubber mayne
Bad motherfucker dawg, you don't really wanna 
tell a nigga he can get it, if I gotta get up on it
If I got it I'ma flaunt it, I'ma make a nigga want it
Smack the hater in the face with a stack of them hundreds
All about the dollar bill, you don't wanna holler kill
Been broke and I know how that feels
Still real in the field tryin to get another mil'
Life is love and nigga that's for real 

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Wish Bone]
I'ma hit 'em with a hustle, I ain't him
On the block in the winter with the whip, Timb's on, lights on
Let's go, no no, gotta give 'em what they came for
Still need dough to fold
Bet ya hood at quite like mines
Step up and you will lay down
Let's see yours, I'm comin for mine
So pay now, or lay down
Hit 'em with a hurricane, I'm serious mayne
Glock cocked, you don't wanna play
No games, insane - everybody, every day
In the midst of all the shit, better be good
If you spit some shit, nigga better be hood
I'ma rep this thug shit, speak this thug shit
Live this thug shit, FUCK them other niggaz~!

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Krayzie Bone]
Now let me tell you about a hustler stayin above the water
I'm not even makin my quota but they know I'm hotter than Florida
Niggaz know I'ma sew it up like a suicide bomber
I blow 'em up cause they just some soldiers
Nigga I done paid my dues, you don't really wanna walk in my shoes
You ain't tryin to get caught up in my blues
It's like the news cause every different day is a struggle
but nigga anxious to bubble, we gotta huddle - they don't hear me though
They don't know about our hard times nigga 'til they saw mine
Then I bet they be like "Oh wow, you alive?"
Talk about a nigga homeless
Man I put the less in the home and in the coldest winters
But I don't wanna live a, life like this-a
Cause pretty soon I'd rather got a up pipe nigga
If I don't come up on me some bread
Cause I got a lotta demons runnin through in my head, yeah
And I really bet I'm thinkin never knowin that I'm goin
And I'm runnin through the snow because I'm huntin for a motherfucker
What you know about hard times?

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
And I'm ready for the world's war and stuck up in the mind
Out of the dark, and when we talkin to the Lord
No adultery callin me, spoilin me sword
Swallow the pain, game that I could have never won
We rep it with the sights see, hide me, why me?
Many want to fight me, beside me, then bite me
Like me, love me, then shove me righteously
Only could be me, only could be me
Tired of me, vibe with me, slide with me violently
Up from the sun and we come, if we don't
We gave you your wings and they got no love for me
No drug on me, Christ roll with me
I keep the sun with me, everything pimpin
Enemies get singin green, 350
AK, shotgun double barrels
I say rock, son

[Chorus]</pre>
