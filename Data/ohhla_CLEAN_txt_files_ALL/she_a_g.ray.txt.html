[Intro]
Uhh...Uhh
Yea..

[Chorus]
She a bad bitch, I think I love her
She a G, gangsta than a motherfucker
She a bad bitch, I think I love her
She a G, gangsta than a motherfucker
Gangsta than a motherfucker, gangsta than a motherfucker
She a bad bitch, yep, I think I love her
She a G, gangsta than a motherfucker
Gangsta than a motherfucker, gangsta than a motherfucker..

[Ray Cash]
Hey, she had the body of a vixen, the swag of a veteran
The face of a angel, bag full of Louis letters man (damn!)
I'm talkin L's and V's, hell I"ll supply you with the O's to the E
Wanna be my love, she stepped out with a mean ass swagger
Superior and Euclid parking lot of the plaza
I approached her, what's ya name, she said "Hello, I'm Kumay"
Thats different, Hi, I'm "You Ray"..haha touch√©..
Rumors niggaz was spreading was faker than a toupe
Running around saying "You got murdered last Tuesday"
Baby people is crazy, know how haters in this city do
So, lock up your car, follow me in City Blue
She wrote down the math, gave me a hug
Felt the snub on my back and said "I love gangsta rap"
When we passed a black tinted out truck
She seen the boyz watchin, before she left
She whispered in my ear, "Baby watch them they plottin"

[Chorus]

[Ray Cash]
After our first late night conversation that was all she wrote
Fell in love when she said she used to sell dope (sold dope)...Sold dope..
21 yrs. old nigga!, can tell by the swag she only fuck with older niggaz
My mother always stressed, "Look out for them gold diggers"
But with this gangsta bitch, I think I struck gold nigga
She twist up a Louis to the 06 back pack, pulled the thing up out it
I said I'd love to see ya clap that, "Clap this?", Clap that, "Like this, clap, clap"
Cock back, put it to my ribs, like where your watch at
And dont look on the face, I'm like c'mon now stop that
If this is real life, this where you get the drop at
Smacked her on the ass, like whooo!, gotta run boo!
Shoot my 1, 2, she kissed me and then she said "One boo!"
Repeat the CD, of BIG's "Me and My Bitch"
We dont watch Bonnie and Clyde, cuz they'll be all that shit

[Chorus]
She a bad bitch, yes, I really love her
She a G, gangsta than a motherfucker
She a bad bitch, yes, I know I love her
She a G, gangsta than a motherfucker
Gangsta than a motherfucker, gangsta than a motherfucker
She's a bad bitch, and yes, I think I love her
She a G, gangsta than a motherfucker
Gangsta than a motherfucker, gangsta than a motherfucker..

[Ray Cash]
What?!..bitch fuck you too
Shit, see what this gangsta love, done made me do
I gotta grab her my her neck, push her up against the wall
Like Uhh..Uhh..put in the ball, Aww, sweet lay her on the sheets
Caress her on her arm, I admire her while she sleep
She a freak, but she a gangsta though, damn I love a gangsta ho
She do the things that gangsta's do, she know the things that gangsta know
I'm her dude, she my boo
Got my name tatooed on her ass and it state Ray Cash
Told me all about her fantasies, to have a gangsta family
A little gangsta boy, a little gangsta girl
She mumbled in her sleep, "Daddy, gangstas rule the world"
I kissed her on the cheek, and said thats right baby girl
Lit the swisher sweet, kicked my feet up, reclined my seat back
Took a couple of puffs, and took a glance to where the heat at
She got the deuce next to the tech, the purple made me see that
Funny how our love for the guns made me peep that (Cough)
Wait let me put the weed back, get my self together....get my G back
Hold up, fuck that, let me take a step back
Same spot she sleepin at, the same spot I slept at
I'm in love with my gangsta boo, and I can accept that
But love aint what gangstas do, so how can I respect that
Yea she a gangsta bitch, no way I could regret that
Ugh, I'm a gangsta too theirs just a minor setback
Wish we could be together B, but we could prolly never, ever
Be together B, we prolly never be one
Look like Ray and Kumay is done
I'll holla, sianara, I'm out, peace boo, one! I'm gone
Creeping out the crib, pistol in my holster
Heard her deuce go (click, clack), got me lookin over my shoulder
She's a G...</pre>
