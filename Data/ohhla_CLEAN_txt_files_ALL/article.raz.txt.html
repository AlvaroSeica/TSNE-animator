[Intro: Hell Razah]
Yeah, Freedom of Speech, Article One
Rebel Music, feather pen, sword written in blood here
Uh-huh, 4th Disciple, Razah, paint the white house black
Freedom of speech, we say what we want, do what we say
Live what we say, take the oath, and tell the truth

[Hell Razah]
Aiyo, the Bush's got plans, to lock down the pan and stand
Take all the heroine, take it out the desert land
The black man, write his war, why, we would never fear
I be a Sun of Man, blood kin of Abraham
Holy wars in Iran, now we be in Askan
Divided we stand, united we fall
Like Babylon, they build the twin towers too tall
In these days of revelations, ain't nobody could ball
Hand writings on the project walls, written in Hebrew
With hand made Desert Eagles, I kill evil
Four hundred years later, we still feeble
My inmates that's locked in hell, we still need you
I be the breath of life, for dead people
Valley and drop o's, I dare who try to sit it in my throne
He's an asshole for thinkin' he can fuck with our zone
He better spit that weak shit about them diamonds and hoes

[Chorus 2X: Hell Razah]
Aiyo, it's article one, break you down like the parts of a gun
Razah and 4th, Article One

[Hell Razah]
Which way the paint game, we been in the flame, hot tracks
With a mean Shaq / Shaft, after Penny go flow
Son of Daniel, we'll read the manual to a pro
Over our head be a halo, my tray eight'o
Come in colors like Play-Doh, and kid Lego's
Most losers turn Judas when they see peso's
Well alrighty then, we rhyme like David and his mighty men
Drivin' in a shiny benz without tiny rims
Oh you a peeler, he's a dealer, so what, we still iller
Now it's time to meet your parents for real, like Ben Stiller
Chain glitter, like a chandelier, fam's got hammers in here
So you better show some manners this year
Aiyo, my first name is Hell, last name Razah
We ain't try'nna deal with no snakes and no traitors
First name 4th, last name Disciple
We them maniacs, comin' back for the title

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Movie sample]
Are you anti technology, are you anti science? (No not all
The question that I'm askin', is this
Are we happier? For the human race, is the world
Fundimently a better place, because of science and technology)</pre>
