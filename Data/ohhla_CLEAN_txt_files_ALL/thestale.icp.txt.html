[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Let me see ya throat thing there buddy, I'ma chop it
See the idea is to make you die (Stop it)
I don't know why but your heart beat offends me
I need to cut you off at the windpipe desperately
(Like, how but cuttin your own neck) I did
17 times why you think I talk like this?
Before I cut myself THIS WAS MY VOICE
Now gimme your neck pipe, you don't have no fuckin choice
(I'm not ready to die) Neither was Eazy-E
What makes you so fuckin special you can escape the Wreath
(You mean Wraith) I said Wraith, now shut the fuck up
And give me you windpipe so I can cut the motherfucker
(Pick somebody else) I'm pickin anybody I can find
And you happen to be the next motherfucker in like
(Ok let's do it) Keep still, right there
And about 1, 2, 3 of those motherfuckers, I'm outta here

[Chorus]
Let me make the pain be gone, I wanna STAB STAB STAB
It's like, murdering be givin me a calm, I need to YEAH YEAH YEAH
Let me make the pain be gone, I wanna STAB STAB STAB
It's like, murdering be givin me a calm, I need to
(Ah ha... What kind of circus is this?)

[Violent J]
How you gonna give me a straight jacket when I'm crooked
Took it and shook it, ripped it and unzipped it
And waited for the nurse guy to bring me my tray
Jumped him from behind and turned his head backwards my way
Took all his keys and a crate of Methadone
Masturbated on myself and leaped out the window
Then I turned around and went right back inside
Once I realized I could've grabbed a gang of Formeldahyde
Suddenly another fuckin guard shot me
I played the whole movie shits off like "You got me"
Laid there playin dead and when he checked my pockets
I jabbed my fuckin thumb knuckle deep in his eye socket
By now there was guards everywhere
I'm steady cuttin heads off, surfin on a wheelchair
And too many bullets finally put me away
But was it the real Violent J?

[Chorus]
Let me make the pain be gone, I wanna STAB STAB STAB
It's like, murdering be givin me a calm, I need to YEAH YEAH YEAH
Let me make the pain be gone, I wanna STAB STAB STAB
It's like, murdering be givin me a calm, I need to YEAH YEAH YEAH
(It kills the pain... it's the only thing that kills the pain, I'm sorry)

[Juggalo Scrub Chant] - repeat 4X
I'm so sorry that I'm so stale... I'm so sorry I'm stale
But still I gotta murder your face... Man I'm sorry I'm stale</pre>
