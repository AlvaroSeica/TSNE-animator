Song:   Take Risks
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Hit the highway up we like 8 bricks
Fuck the police you gotta take trips
Put your trust in yourself don't ever trust a bitch
Hit the kitchen up and water whip
You gotta stretch that work you wanna be rich
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks

[Verse 1]
I'm a super savage, got a money habit
I'm addicted to bad bitches I gotta have it
Fear risks every day transporting cabage
In and out of state moving like a chad rabbit
Whole lot of drugs on me gotta meet the casket
Cable boy on the block, tryin to make it happen
Everybody in the squad ain't no fucking rapper
Try and poke me if you want I'm a get to clappin
They know who to call scorpion's beyond the package
Money longer than train tracks, ye I'm cashing
Loud men from California and he ain't taxing
One shipment a month nigga and I'm relaxing

[Chorus]
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Hit the highway up we like 8 bricks
Fuck the police you gotta take trips
Put your trust in yourself don't ever trust a bitch
Hit the kitchen up and water whip
You gotta stretch that work you wanna be rich
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks

[Verse 2]
In the streets every day I be taking risks
Make that work work, make the siff flip
I ain't taking no losses only taking risks
Fucking foreign bitches, driving foreign wheels
Just rob my plug came up I took a risk
I be taking shit, these niggas fake as shit
What you call your wife, I call a basic bitch
Ass fuck like Bob Marley on my jamaican shit
Don't make me take the spraying shit, tell 'em this max and cader shit
Over the stove I'm working out, I'm guilty man I'm with the shit
I ain't with all that talk and shit, I don't do no box and shit
All I know is pistols pop we turned up and we dropping shit

[Chorus]
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Hit the highway up we like 8 bricks
Fuck the police you gotta take trips
Put your trust in yourself don't ever trust a bitch
Hit the kitchen up and water whip
You gotta stretch that work you wanna be rich
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks
Tryin to get some money gotta take risks</pre>
