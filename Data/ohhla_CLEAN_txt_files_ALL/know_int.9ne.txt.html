[King Just]
No need to introduce who I am and what I came for
Shaolin SOLDIERS!  Enterin the third world war
Lock your doors (DOORS) hold your drawers
It ain't safe no more - you done fucked up and broke God's laws
Ten commandments - but thy shall only know NINE
That's why I wrote the shit in my rhyme
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH - still on top of the game
Ain't nuttin changed but the Range; I'm on a higher plane
Ain't it strange - that people wanna take away your fame? (fame)
Slander your name (name), may they all burn from the flames (flames)
The Fists of Math clique'll have ya ass insane
and the rest of you faggots is LAME

WHAT?!  BLAOW!  No introduction..

[Nine]
I'm on the roof like the fiddler, bustin shots
Bringin pain like a wisdom tooth
Murder devils and hide they bodies like the truth
I've got proof, black man is the original
First to ride both mental and physical
You ain't got a clue - I'm true like rain is wet
The Dark Math clique is about to set it on the industry
I feel like they wanna get rid of me
I'm paranoid; that's why I keep steel
Cause I know I ain't the only nigga that's real
(TELL 'EM HOW YOU FEEL!) Like I'm runnin on a wheel in circles
Singin she loves me, she loves me not
Headed for three hots in a cot yellin BLOOD CLAAT
Who shot ya in the back when you wasn't lookin
Your life got tooken, cause you was sleepin
I can feel niggaz when they creepin
Born = Nine, I shine with two sides like a diamond line
To get mine sharp like a porcupine, slick like turpentine
Smoother than wine, always keep a concubine
My mind interwine to form a bond, with rain and sunshine
to get loot like Calvin Klein
Stay away from swine and slime at all times
Recline and ponder design a rhyme
Then sign on the dotted line rewind and find the bell wind and chime
It define why I'm gettin better in my prime
Spit shine the mic with new types of crime, combine
Form with King Just to form "Know King-troduction"
Chickenheads keep cluckin, bitch-ass niggaz start duckin
When the Dark Math nigga and the Shaolin Soldier starts buckin
What the fuck you KNOW INTRODUCTION
- DUCTION, - DUCTION, - DUCTION, WHAT?!?!</pre>
