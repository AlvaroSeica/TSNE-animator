Typed by: aa8@cant.ac.uk

All that's cool but, yo, what's up with me and you?

[Chorus x2]
See the blind mice? We the blind mice
Trying to get in where we fit in
Doing anything to be down
Two hundred million blind mice
Running through this town

[Shock-G]
Patty Cake, Patty Cake I heard your man
Wears a gold Rolex and put a diamond on your hand

[Money B]
The Itsy-Bitsy Spider was a whoridah
Said he met the judge's daughter and went up inside her

[Shock-G]
House, there's a Mouse who Runs Around the Clock snitching
Who he hitting, I think he hit it raw cause he be itching

[Money B]
Shimmy, Shimmy Cocoa Pop, the glock went pop
Tell me, tell me who shooting and who got shot

[Malia]
Ring Around the Rosie, a pocket full of blow
Everybody know the hop got you moving slow

[Humpty-Hump]
Pinocchio says ignore my nose, you can trust him
I saw Bill in the back of Capitol Hill with Lil' Miss Muffin

[Shock-G]
Little Boys in Blue and Red Riding in the Hood
Heard the Big Bad Wolf said he never used the n-word
He huffs and puffs, he'll snuff you in an alley
But the Three Little Pigs scurry back to Simi Valley

[Money B]
Goldilocks went to cop some little boy brown
Should've stuck with the snow cause the brown cut her down

[Humpty-Hump]
The Itsy-Bitsy Spider at the National Enquirer
Said the mayor told Niola to bend over or he'll fire her

[Shock-G]
The freaky Old Lady In The Shoe downtown
Is a brown sugar mommy, wants to pay to lick me down

[Humpty-Hump]
The Big Bad lady Wolf said that she knew me
She huffed and she puffed and she .. mmmmm!

[Shock-G]
Three grinding mice
Trying to make a life called three strikes
The rat got three to five, two got life
Those Three Blind Mice

[Humpty-Hump]
Now, Tom Thumb jumped up and said "I got one,
David Duke and Farrakhan riding side-by-side on the top gun"

[Shock-G]
Hickory Dickory Dock, each day I hear a new shock
The Cat in the Hat told me he be seeing Tupac

[Rashida]
Cinderella told me you was paid, if it's all true
Simon Says you can grab the hat, sink and fall through

[Black Ty]
"Somebodys sleeping in my bed, getting my head
Now his broad is on the stroll getting my bread"

[Humpty-Hump]
And Humpty Dumpty leaning against the wall
Couldn't figure out the meaning of it all..

What's the meaning, whats the meaning of life

[Shock-G]
Little Bo Peep is weeping, I hate to see you cry
Sometimes guys lie when your thighs are above you
Mother May I say you denied the evidence
The frog was only a prince when he loved you

[Money B]
Virgin Mary Poppins popping game, said she never had sex
Now shes popping X, talking about "whos next?"

[Clee]
Scooby went to scoop another scooby sack from Shaggy
Scooby will do anything: hops, weed or cavi

[Humpty-Hump]
Old Mother Hubbard's got a cupboard full of lotto tickets
A fat stack from way back cause she's pack rat

[Shock-G]
Mother Goose hit me on the cell phone, said granny
Got her healthcare pulled, had to move to Miami

[Money B]
Poppa Bear got no time for Baby Bear
Can't stop to feel the breeze in the race for the cheese

[Clee]
Peter Pan's in the White House dealing
Keeping the money out my hands, making me out to be the villain

[Humpty-Hump]
Humpty Dumpty looking at the moon, leaning on the wall
Still couldn't figure out the meaning of it all..

[Chorus x2]

[Shock-G]
Patty Cake, Patty Cake, can I be your man?
My cash flow's low but bro's got the master plan

[Humpty-Hump]
Patty Cake, Patty Cake, can I be your lover
I'm wealthy in the mind and I'm healthy under covers

[Rashida]
Papa Bear, Papa Bear, to put it modestly
I like diamonds &amp; pearls but I'll settle for some honesty

[Money B (Shock-G)]
Patty Cake, Patty Cake, can I hit your soda
I'm thirsty and I'm out (Yo, this nursery rhyme's over)</pre>
