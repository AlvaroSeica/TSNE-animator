Song:   Hard Night For Sarah
Typed by: timmy.bogenburt@gmail.com

It's been a hard night for Sarah, the divorce went through today
Ten years out the window, she'd been faithful all the way
She's feeling really bitter, she's feeling lost and small
She wonders where it all went wrong, she can't seem to recall

It's been a hard night for Sarah, she's taken quite a fall
Well he was all she ever hoped for, and she gave him all she had
Never gave her cause to worry, never hurt her or made her sad
And no one thought to tell her, they all figured that she knew
Just another harmless fling, a phase all men go through

It's been a hard night for Sarah, she's gonna have to see it through
Gonna have to see it through

*Guitar solo*

Now the sun is slowly rising on another brand new day
The children will be waking soon, and she'll send them on their way

It's been a hard night for Sarah (hard night for Sarah)
It's been a hard night for Sarah (hard night for Sarah)
It's been a hard night for Sarah

But today's another day, today's another day</pre>
