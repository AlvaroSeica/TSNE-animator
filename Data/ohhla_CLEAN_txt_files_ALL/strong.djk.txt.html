	(CL Smooth verse)
(yeah, DJ Krush in the house, the car-mel kingpin 
CL Smooth and only the strong survive)

actual facts
the ghetto reacts to warfare
real bullets miss you by your hair
survival of the fittest
hell for the three time losers
the prisoners of enemy manuvers
hold down the fort
coz life is short enough to get it taken
forsaken when your mental planes' breakin
concealin' a 4 pound with every area
we surround coz clown
I get down for my crown
take it to the streets for the 
honour and respect
connect the lethal
plus my young guns are unbeatable
aiding and abetting the foul
is a violation
that's why my retalliation
is premeditation
the invitation
is to run with a crew you can't do
and too great to infiltrate from a 
nickel plate
I state
this be the illest ever known on a rush
swervin' with the krush

	(CL Smooth 2nd verse)
slip into the world of shiesty individuals
a troubled man stalked by criminals
creeping through the city
I step on the block to chat with
thugs from all the drugs for fatcat
stepping off the set now hand on my tool
thinking how bad I want to flip on that fool
times are wasting
chasing these punks for petty loot
when there is a real mission to execute
I put the plan in effect
forget what you heard
when you get the word from 1st and 3rd
for real I got the fam and all my soldiers to feed
with the gunslingers on the block puffin' weed
envision the prison that I walk through
leaving any witness
when I'm about to handle my business
no escape from the duct tape and artillery
now tell me big man
where's the money aint a damn thing funny

	(CL Smooth 3rd verse)
cops play for medals
killers play for corners
in the middle are your sons and are 
your daughters
who gives the orders
to chaos and mayhem
who has the proper guidance and mind to save them
from this cold world of heartless ghetto dwellers,
pimps, prostitutes, and dope sellers
strive to be the lead and not follow
ladies
you can be the queens of tommorrow
dig it, I want all that and more
for my peeps in the stuggle
food, clothing, and shelter
is essential
to maintain the hardcore from the soft
that pushed me to the edge but I can't fall off
my battlegrounds keep the sound of babies crying,
gunshots, and cursing
can you feel my reel
here's the deal
by any means necessary
go all out
and keep this alive
coz only the strong survive
