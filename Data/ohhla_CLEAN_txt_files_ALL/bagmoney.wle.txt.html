{Intro: Rick Ross] (T-Pain)
Money over everythang (Yeaaah-ee)
Self made, but right now shawty (Ey-ey-ey-ey-ei-ee)
You lookin like money (yea!)

(Yeah-EAH!)

[Chorus: Rick Ross] (T-Pain)
My bitch bad, lookin like a bag of money         (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)
That bitch bad, lookin like a bag of money       (Yea-ea-ea-ey-ei-ee)
I go and get it and I let her count it for me      (Hey-ey-eh-ey-ei-ee)
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me  (Ooooh, she bad)
My bitch bad, lookin like a bag of money         (She bad bad bad, she bad bad bad)
That bitch bad, lookin like a bag of money       (She bad bad bad, she bad ohh-oh-ooh-wooo-ooh)
I go and get it and I let her count it for me      (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh)
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me  (Oooh, she ride it for me)

[Interlude: Rick Ross] (T-Pain)
She got me caught up in the moment            (She got me caught up in the mo-MENT!)
She got me cuaght up in the moment            (She got me caught up in the moment)
I only kiss her when she on it                        (Ooh, when she on it)
Fuck her good, make her call me in the morning (Oooh, ooh, whoo)

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Temporary forever (word), levitate witta nigga (word)
I could tease you 'til you hate me, bet you hate them naval kisses (nah)
We can do like eight positions (uh), hit it til yo' make-up missin (uh-huh)
Baby girl my stroke official, and you know I paint that picture
Hoes on my line (Word up!), most of 'em 9s (Word up!)
Couple of 'em dimes, but all my hoes is hard to find
And I ain't always on the prowl, it's just my soda mixed with brown
Got me quite open for a while, so let me in or let me out
And I like my marijuana bright, and I like my window tinted out
Shout out them strippers who hustle - get yours, you know what this about
I just might throw a big amount, don't know if I'm 'posed to take you out
I just know I'm 'posed to praise you up, don't mean I ain't 'posed to take you down
Word up!

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
My bitch bad lookin like a bag of money
E'ry time she fuck me she say "Can I have some money?"
And I say, "Can I get a threesome?Â”, she say "Boy, you funny"
But I be like, "F'real, just pick up that phone, call up one of your girls"
When I'm on that pill and I pop dat purr -- girl, I put in that work
Long as she come to me first, it's fourteen racks what I put on that purse
Shit that Birkin bag, make the old dude mad, when I murk through pass in a dark blue Jag
Say she like my style, but I talk too fast, and I got that drive, and she just might crash
Hold up~! She say she fuckin with me the long way (long way)
She gon' ride this dick, I had a long day (long day)
Nigga look at my bitch, you lookin the wrong way
Somethin mean, look exactly just like the song say

[Chorus + Interlude]
