Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah
Planet's fucked up man
Human beings are the worst thing that happened
To this all Mother Earth baby
This is what it is, uh

The world we're livin' in, this shit is messed up
sometimes I feel like God packed up and left us
Terrorist killing people for no reason
the good die young while evil's still breathing
I can't even turn the news on
all you hear about is dangerous people creating new bombs
Serial killers and natural disasters
I'm just prayin' there be some pieces to put together after
Oil spills after hurricane Katrina
Kim Jong I'll sending threats from North Korea
The middle east, war in the streets
people strapping bombs cause of their religious beliefs
Killing others by the dozen, as the human race
falls victim to our own self destruction
We gotta change the way we live cause it's the same
fucked up world that I'll be leaving to my kids, man

How the fuck am I supposed to raise a family here, man?
How can I leave what we got, give it to my kids like... crazy
Sometimes it's nothin' but bad people, nothin' but bad things goin' on, ah?
Fuck... What can I do, you know? What can I do?

We gotta make a change, it's our duty
we're raping the planet of it's resources and beauty
Gangs kill each other on American soil
while we destroy entire ecosystems drilling for oil
I know times change, the shit evolves
but I remember forests and now the mini malls
Mother Earth been givin' us a warnin'
what happens when the ice caps melt from global warmin'?
Some of the most majestic creatures on this planet
are hunted till the point the population's nearly vanished
Gunned down for recreational activity
and now can only be found at zoos and captivity
We've just become too technologically advanced
at this rate the earth never stood a chance
The Mayans say our time is almost done
so if 2012 is true I guess we had a good run right?

Yeah
2012 man, it's coming
Whatever your opinion is... we fucked
We got oil spillin' on the Gulf Coast
Deforestation in South America man, read about it man, fuck

I'm not trying to seem to pessimistic
but if things don't change, that outcome is realistic
And everyone should be aware of all this shit
as the world spins on it's axis like a kick flip
They say I poorly influence all of this kids
cause honestly they shouldn't idolize the crazy way I live
But I don't want 'em making the same mistakes I did
that will lead 'em to a life full of nothin' but shit
Cause it's not cool to pop mad pills and act crazy
But I got my own demons, my own Slim Shady
that alter ego always up to nothing but trouble
But I left all that behind me when I stepped out of the rumble
And try to get my life together followin' this rap shit
When I say it's all I got, I mean it, that's it
It's the way nobody stoppin' me from makin' it
And if it's not given to me, then I'm takin' it

I'm here baby
You know, I'm always on my party shit
La la la, Off the chain
I'm an intelligent person, I know what's good
Go out, read the newspaper, see what's goin' on around you man
People come stupid, educate yourself </pre>
