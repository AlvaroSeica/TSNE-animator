Welcome, this is your host Mr. Haskill and I present to you "A Beautiful Rhyme"
Similar to A Beautiful Mind in the sense that I'm a schizophrenic with rhymes (SE)
So sometimes I'll tell the truth and sometimes I'll lie (SE)
There's stories, fables, personal experiences and even more than meets the eye
I had many thoughts going through my mind from stories that I heard in my lifetime
So if you get offended it's the characters to blame because to tell you the truth
I probably hate 'em the same
But I created em in this other half of my brain
And the only way to alieve the pain is to write it down and share it
There's a lot of new characters but of course still Eddie and Garrett (SE)
So thank you in advance for your purchase and if you burned this
Fuck it I guess I'll just earn less (SE)
See I don't give a fuck about the $, just give me some life support
So when I retire I'll be without ice but with a nice thought
See happiness is key so until that be me
I'll plug the mic into my lungs and use rap to breathe (Breathe Deep)</pre>
