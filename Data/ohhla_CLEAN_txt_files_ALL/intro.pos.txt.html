[Blueprint talking]
You know what it is
You know who this is, but I'ma say my name anyway
They call me Blueprint
You know my steez
Printmatic
On the tracks we got, RJD2
You know, holdin' it down
This is Soul Position
Probly knew that already though
Yo, now last year, a lot of people been comin' up to me like
"Yo, Print, where's the album at?"
"Homie, workin' on that," was my reply
Took my time with it though
Ain't about to put no garbage out
Feel me?

Soul Position
on a mission to move crowds with ease
D.J.'s, emcees
rethink your obligation to create
Soul Position
on a mission to rip it from the start
D.J.'s, emcees
listen while we make our mark on the art
Soul Position
on a mission to move crowds with ease
D.J.'s, emcees
rethink your obligation to create
Soul Position
on a mission to rip it from the start
