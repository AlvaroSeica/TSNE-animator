When you see me in slow mo once I turn my back
You wanna talk real tough but you not real like that
So let's ride 
 
(Verse 1: Tech N9ne)
You don't want to try me
Leavin niggas soggy heated repeated the Nina be hot as wasabbi
Feelin the fury of missouri sicker than ozzy
Laughin at playa haters gigglin like fozzie
Wocka wocka wocka the nina poppin your shockara
bout to stop up and lock up office I got the body
Out at mecropolis fuckin offa this pop of this
toss em off in a ?? cause murderin is a hobby
You be actin like you bleedin the block
Preachin crack and rap and you needin to stop
We can wack wax and imediately flop
Be the type of crap that indeed it be brought
The want the drama it can be they way
But they don't really wanna see the ninay spray
Let em all bleed it can be they day
Fuckin up with Tech N9ne and DJ Clay
 
(HooK)
 
(Verse 2: DJ Clay)
You don't even know me
Actin like we homies
Then when I turn my back when you hold me
Pussy motha fuckas the ones we call phonies
Keep talkin that we leave yo momma lonely
All black van creepin down your street slowly
Doors open up and we leave your home holey
If your not in then we know where your hoe be
Barrel to her head while I'm makin her blow me
Listen
For all you fake flakes givin real a bad name
You can save it cause we can see through you
Like glasses what you was made of
I'm a let the oozles like I'm not aimin
Make you loose noodles and I ain't talkin ramen
Garentee you ain't leavin with what you came in me
and tech n9ne will pray for you amen
