Song:   Return to Sender
Typed by: @Daneo10

[CHORUS - DAN-E-O]
Dear hip hop, where'd it all go wrong?
It's like my heart stops with every single song
And now I'm disenchanted, working through the pain
This love song's not romantic, if I lose you, what will I gain?

[DAN-E-O]
Dear Hip Hop, what did I do to earn this letter?
I turned the envelope over, it read "return to sender"
I thought due to our history, I'd be deserving better
An earnest defender against any worthless contender
Feeling anxiety as the package sit beside me
My eyes defying me, this stamp is from the middle nineties
I made some noise with this official statement
And held my ground the way I put it down like an initial payment
I thought this shit was sacred, you stripped like chicks who's naked
Of what's sophisticated in all of your hits that's made it
Disrespected and desecrated, no warnings heeded
I mailed you my soul, you didn't have the heart to read it?
We must depart, depleted of any hope that my mission ain't got defeated
Have fun being a pop elitist
Top of the charts, I see this
I would've carried on your name, but now I've cause to be ashamed like an aborted fetus

[CHORUS - DAN-E-O]
Dear hip hop, where'd it all go wrong?
It's like my heart stops with every single song
And now I'm disenchanted, working through the pain
This love song's not romantic, if I lose you, what will I gain?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[DAN-E-O]
Dan-e-o, don't feel downtrodden or derailed
Your mission is something I'd never wanna see fail
God, I hope you get this e-mail
This industry's imprisoned me, this whole system might as well be jail
Yeah, they captured me on TV and radio
But what made you think to find me, that'd be the place to go?
On streets across the world, they still breaking and graf bombing
DJ'n, beatboxing to start a clash rhyming
But where you're from, look at the class I'm in
It's such a crass climate, abusing me and creating cash giants
It ain't even new school, it's after school detention
'Cause in history class, these new cats ain't paid attention
Who you think discovered YouTube?
'Cause how television be representing ain't keeping it true dude
Stay online, we'll travel through this portal together
Immortal forever, I'd never ignore your letter
CHORUS - DAN-E-O:
Dear hip hop, where'd it all go wrong?
It's like my heart stops with every single song
And now I'm disenchanted, working through the pain
This love song's not romantic, if I lose you, what will I gain?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[DWAYNE MORGAN]
I've got more Black Thoughts than an album by The Roots
And I might have to move to another Digable Planet
Because nowadays, y'all don't give a Rass Kass
About my black ass, and all that Jazzmatazz
I remember back when you were a Jungle Brother
Speaking Native Tongues
Dropping Big Puns like the Terror Squad
It was elementary, full of ABC's, Run DMC's
Jay-Z's, Eminem's, EPMD's
But today, you couldn't hear me with a box of Q-Tips
Couldn't see me through Kanye's flashing MC Lytes
Without a Reasonable Doubt, this seems like organized K-OS
I'm lost in line, waiting on my time to see Dr. Dre
Because you've become addicted to murder, The Chronic and crack music,
With no Detox in sight;
When They Reminisce Over You, my God
I hope you don't mind me sharing my 50 Cents
Things are oh so different now from how they were back then
We went from Monie Love to Cash Money, Young Money
Straight money love, living like Outkasts
Ready to Die
Get rich, get free, or just get by
This situation is Ludacris
But everything evolves and grows
So I'm gonna just Fade to Black
And just watch which way you go...</pre>
