Song:   Domestic Silence
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Let me introduce a recluse with his neck in a noose
that went loose a he slipped out
He didn't have a clue what to do
with his new lease of life it was a lease he never took out ya see
He'd never really had a grip on life
Never had a family, no kids, no wife
No real friends, no social life
His life was a concise silent night

At the factory, in fact he kept himself to himself
His existence was distanced from everyone else
He didn't interact with the pack, never had done
He didn't feel the need to impede on their sanctum

And they didn't impede on his
If they ever needed anything they'd leave a list
After a while in that place he didn't seem to exist
And that didn't seem strange, it just is what it is

Sometimes he'd find a whole week had passed
Since he last took a gasp and words were cast
On his days off he'd wonder if he'd gone deaf
As he drifted in silence, no noise no mess

He used to have the radio playing in his hall
But that stopped when the broadcast stopped being so broad
He didn't like TV so he got rid of it
He liked to read books and sit for the hell of it

So that was his life, didn't seem that bad
But he still chose to take his own life i his hands
Still chose to kick that chair from his feet

[Chorus]
Silence can be golden but gold can sometimes suffocate
Like that girl in that James Bond film, too late to respirate
Tragedy can be plain to see with lights and sirens
But sometimes it ain't quite so clear, Domestic Silence

Unspoken, so much goes unspoken
Till you're choking on a fragile glass heart smashed open
With this near miss his eyes would either open
Or sink deeper down into a silence never broken

Forsaken isolation and silence all around you
It'll drag you to the deeper water and it WILL drown you
He returned to work the very next day
Lucks intervention got no mention, nothing new to say
But then out of nowhere everything changed
When a voice said "Hi there, how are you today?"
Six simple words, seven simple syllables
It doesn't always take grand gestures or miracles

When in hell a hiding place can seem grace and free from pain
But umbrellas keep out sunshine as well as rain
He discarded all the fears that his silence had been masking
And said "yeah I'm good. Thanks for asking"

[Chorus]
Silence can be golden but gold can sometimes suffocate
Like that girl in that James Bond film, too late to respirate
Tragedy can be plain to see with lights and sirens
But sometimes it ain't quite so clear, Domestic Silence</pre>
