[Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
I never felt the feeling of euphoria
Pain forever, prolonged
The pros and cons of prosperity is strong
Wake up in the morning and I gotta win
Not taking the victory is my only sin
And so I send a message to your messenger
A warning shot to let 'em know I'm serious
I'm ready for a war, when I roar it can break a glass window
The only thing for sure's the perfect way to bend you
on your back, even if I gotta slither through the cracks
I can crack every code you deliver, I attack
every hole where the bomb squad sit it on a tripod
Even if he try hard, he can still die hard
Run but you can't hide, white flags
You can pull 'em out fast and tell me your last goodbye

[Chorus]
I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes, and all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love

[Kendrick Lamar]
Make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing
You know I take risk, darks clouds, I love it
Cause I can hide in the mist, hop out and crushing
every soldier you're wit, so I'm six for six
I'm sick with determination, I terminate ya quick
I lead the pack, I follow no rules
I see the traps, I know you're close to
falling on your face, unload, reload
Hand me another case, explode, explode
The fire in my eyes is waiting on your demise
I know you hope your help is close by

[Chorus]</pre>
