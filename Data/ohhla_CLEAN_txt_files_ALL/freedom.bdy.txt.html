[Intro: Mooseman]
Aiyyo Ice man; I'm working on this term paper for college 
What's the First Amendment?

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Freedom of Speech, that's some motherfucking bullshit
You say the wrong thing, they'll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says: "Profanity - No Airplay"?
They can suck my dick, while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore?
Yo PMRC, here we go, raw
Yo Tip, what's the matter? - You ain't getting no dick?
You're bitching about Rock'N'Roll, that's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey PMRC, you stupid fucking assholes
The sticker on the record; is what makes them sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Freedom of Speech!! just watch what you say
Freedom of Speech!! Yeaahh, just watch what you say
Freedom of Speech!! Yeaahh boy, just watch what you say
You have the right to remain silent

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Fuck that right! - I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna, yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage cold illing
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers depriving the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day, any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfucking apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
Cause once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Freedom of Speech!! Yeaahh, just watch what you say
Freedom of Speech!! Yeaahh boy, just watch what you say
Freedom of Speech!! Ha ha! You better watch what you say
Explicit Lyrics!! Explicit Lyrics!!

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said "Fuck"
So I thought for a minute and said "No!
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show"
Cause for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cause there's no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got their's coming, cause I'm mad and I'm gunning
Homeboys, and there's no running
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothing but a piece of fucking shit on the damned map

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Freedom of Speech!! Yeaahh, just watch what you say
Freedom of Speech!! Yeaahh, You better watch what you say
Freedom of Speech!! Just watch what you say
Parental Advisory!! Parental Advisory!!
 
[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Freedom of Speech, let them take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let them censor books, let them censor art
PMRC, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm saying, Fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Freedom of Speech!! Yeaahh, just watch what you say
Freedom of Speech!! You better watch what you say
Freedom of Speech!! Yeaahh boy, You better watch what you say
Explicit Lyrics!! Explicit Lyrics!!

[Outro: Jello Biafra]
What they're trying to do with radio
With this uhh.. McCarron-Walter Act and a lot of other ways
Is start by saying that they're protecting the public from wicked rock bands; 
or.. girlie magazines, or whatever. 
But if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down;
What they're really trying to do, is shut off our access to information itself
If they can't do it by law, they know there's other ways to do it</pre>
