[Uncle Grandpa]
That's a pretty cool beat Tiger

Yo it's Uncle Grandpa (and Pizza Steve)
{Mr. Gus} ((Belly Bag, yo you best believe!))
We've come bring the heat, while we pop lock
Hotter than your favorite - hot sauce!!

[Pizza Steve]
Yo it's Pizza Steve, a/k/a P.S.
And when I'm on the mic, I be fresh
Straight from the oven, hate it or love it
My cheese is thick and my crust is rugged

[Uncle Grandpa]
Good morning~!! It's your Uncle Grandpa
I can rap on the mic, with my pants off
I got a sick ride - it's called the RV
Where's the mustard, for my hotdog party?
I like to help kids by using my magic
Hey wait a second - check out this hat trick!
That makes me fly, I'm a cool guy
I like sour cream on my blueberry pie
Now I'm almost done, with my rhymin
So stick around - for Michael Symon

[Belly Bag]
It's your favorite friend - Belly Bag!
I got loads of fun from toys to smelly rags
But my favorite thing is making mouth noises
So listen to me, me, and my boys'es!
{*Belly Bag starts beatboxing*}
Ha-ha, hee-ha, hee a hee ha
Heeheeheeha, heeheeheeheeha
Wha, wha-wha, wha-wha, whugga-wha-wha
{*babbling noises*}

[Mr. Gus]
Yo it's Mr. Gus call me, Big G
I put words together, intricately
You can't mess, with this dino flow
Pay close attention, or my rhymes'll go
over yo' head like a helicopter
Tell your doctor to quell the opera
of pain, that you will experience
if you step to Gus cause Gus will get furious
The waters run deep, and I'm the deepest
Profound sound better, than the weakest
Big G crushes foes who deserve the meat fist
But I'm chill M to F and on the weekends
So as I end this verse, let me just say
that Big G and crew get the party underway
Wait hold up~! Who wants to join the cypher?
It's Giant Realistic, Flying TIGERRRRR!!!!
