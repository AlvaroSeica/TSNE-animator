[Intro: Layzie]
What's up baby? Uh-huh, Uh-huh (hey sugar)
Lookin all fine and sexy and shit
You know I like that (yeah, with your fine self)
Uh-huh (uh-huh, yeah, yeah)
You see a sexy, sexy, lady snap pop, snap pop, drop
Quit trippin baby (hit the snap, pop, uh)

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
Anythang I'll do (for you) anythang (all for you)
Anythang I'll do (for you) anythang (all for you)
Anythang I'll do (for you) anythang (all for you)
Anythang I'll do (for you) anythang (all for you)

[Layzie Bone]
Image is everything and skills is twice that
Thuggin in my nature baby, it's just like that
I hustle on the daily, and you wanna fight that
You wouldn't want me if my ass was broke flat
Please, give me a break sweety, I do the best I can
What I gotta do to get through and get you to understand?
You got the upper hand, I'm just a simple man
My only plan is to hustle to keep a couple grand
Up in my pocket, my hustle, don't try to knock it
These haters they steady watchin, coppers they steady plottin
They wanna take me to prison, that's why I need you to listen
It's dangerous but we livin, need you to quit trippin
Who bought that new house for ya?
Who bought that new Mercedes?
Pimped out with them flat screen TV's
All that's cause you're my lady 

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
I used to watch you playin hopscotch, lickin on the lollipop
Run up and grab your ponytail, you chase me up the whole block
First kisses, playin hide and go get it
Whoever would've thought that you'd become my Mrs.
You know my family, my whole damn steelo
You never liked my boys but baby them my people
I come to you, when I need that affection
I carry heat because I need my protection
It's hard for a pimp, but it's hell for a hustler
I ain't never been no pimp and I ain't never been no busta
I love ya, I trust ya, you my muh'fucker
And the word in the hood is we make a cute couple
You know what's hood, you got the struggle to bubble
I mention money-makin moves and then you tell me it's trouble
But girl, but girl, don't you be so worried
Because I'm livin this soldier story 

[Chorus]

[Felecia]
Baby I appreciate you, cause you never let me down yet
Baby I appreciate you, cause you're one hell of a catch
Anything you want from me, I'll be sure to do
Cause I know anything I want and need, I can get it from you
Baby I appreciate you, cause you put your lady first
Baby I appreciate you, baby I appreciate you
Baby I appreciate you</pre>
