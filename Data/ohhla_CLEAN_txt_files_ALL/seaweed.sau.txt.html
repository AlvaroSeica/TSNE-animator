[Saul Williams]
I drive a yellow Volvo
'86 submarine
Someone's behind me in an escalade trying to blind me with their high beams
I make a left
I'm the road to nowhere, heading west
The sky is purple streaks
The sun is setting in my chest
I feel warm inside
So I'm going for a ride
Put your picture on my dashboard 'till my fate and yours collides

[Mia Doi Todd]
Seaweed... washed upon the shore...
Severed locks of he who walks the ocean's floor

[Saul Williams]
Got a yellow Volvo
'86 submarine
Rims like Tibetan prayer wheels and my tank is filled with dreams
Fuck the game, I practice being in the passing lane
And watch the price of gasoline rise with the price of fame
I'm immortal
I render unto Caesar to be cordial
He sees a wooden casket where I see a glowing portal
Check your engine, looks like you're running on the blood of Indians
Put some turquoise in that Rolls Royce before you crash into a pendulum

[Mia Doi Todd]
Seaweed ...washed upon the shore...
Severed locks of he who walks the ocean's floor

[Saul Williams]
I drive a yellow Volvo
'86 submarine
I drove it under water guided by my own high beams
Nothing's left
Witnessed the demolition of the west
Felt like a little kid hiding in my mothers' dress
I'm in space
The lone ambassador of every race
The starfish that discover me plant their flags into my face
I'm a clone of every written and unwritten poem
A shark pulls up beside me fingering beads and chanting "Om"
I can't believe it
I never really thought that sharks would need it
I thought they'd made their peace: bite it, bleed it, kill it, eat it
but I was wrong
Every living being deserves a song
And our passions must be rationed 'till our rations sing along</pre>
