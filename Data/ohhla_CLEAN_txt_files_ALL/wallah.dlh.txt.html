[Verse 1]
Somebody's knockin' on the door somebody's ringin' the bell
Somebody's knockin' on the door and we got em all scared as hell
But you ain't gotta open up still I bust through
Like a Mac truck rollin' over them guts
En la back of la traila you know I got mis amigos
Los camaradas to these Lower EastSide Angelinos
Mis perros mi guardan
Muerden know ladran feel a seizure coming on if I sick em on ya
Soy Blaxicano Latino El Pistolero
Snatch a crown off the king and wipe it all on my huevos
Ankles I bust you best invest in a brace
I'm makin' moves shake and bake and then I eat the whole plate
I'm psyclone like a dog for his bone you take a piece of my pie
Well then it's on y va star cabrone
Cause when you're fuckingg with the bull it's the horns you get
I gotta pierce that epidermis when I go for your neck
(And I'm serio) a no lo crees pendejo te dejo
Patadon a los huevos cacheton a lo sesos

[Chorus 2X]
It's mi costa the West is reclaimed by this critical acclaimed
Underated still I wreck your main frame
It's mi costa wallah don't make a sah
I'm about to put it on ya I came I'm gonna

[Verse 2]
I'm tense nervous about my inside feelin'
But I still keep muthafuckas dancin' on the ceilin'
Watch the smoke rise Ives burned but still I
Floss Delinquente compound the real high
Fuego to leno leno to boca
Bird finger flippin' trippin' off the chota
Smooth with the west wind chest plate to vest in
I smoke a toke of mari to my chest in
I ain't violent mira I'm just a stoner
Rockin' Lower EastSide sunny Southern California
Flows start to rockin' if shit gets to poppin'
Bloody knuckle style moppin' if teeth get to droppin'
You could keep the style rockin with breakin' or loose lockin'
Even if the pigs come knockin' we won't be stoppin'

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 3]
Chale me vale madre you fuck around I'll pull a hale
Delinquentize todos Sur Cali
So sit back relax put on your head gear
Let me work this beat like an offic-ier
It's mi costa the West is reclaimed by this critical acclaimed
Underrated still I wreck your main frame
I be that one huero loco psyclone in la mente
Claimin el tereno feelin muy excelente
See last year I took it straight up to your frente
To penetrate your coco flexin con el huero loco
Back up on the scene to smash your pipe dream
You can run but you can't hide when my sac swings
See it's the pendulum cuttin' baby shake their but and
In fact tell you somethin' fool you ain't nothin'

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
