[Solitair]
Yo
Let me take yo through the mind of a man
Driven Mad by the rhyme
My soul's been arrested for committing hate crimes
My mouth speaks the wordz
bringin' news to the ears of the blind
Catch ya self mimmicking
And think about the wordz you be speakin'
Got my soul saved by the deacon
Seekin'
To cast the demons away
What can I say?
The guardz must be crazy lettin' niggaz my stray
Ya'll can't control other things that I say
So what I said yesterday, I'm gonna have to pay for today
Call the arbitrator
C.M.P could do me a courtesy
And ask the man to copt me a plea
My actions are beyond me
I hope I can take the repurcussions
I'm chilled to the bone like a bustion
Visions of corruption perpitrate the mind state
Solitair rocks the bull th ebile till the bow breaks
Cause the stakes leavin' scars in the earth like quakes
So You better ask my Man "Choclair" "What It Takes"
I Makes........Endd meats
Like a Street Carnisore-a
More wordz than ya earz can endure-a
For Sure-a
2 by 2 like No-a
Plus my scriptures is sacred like the tora

Talking)
What Chu Goin DO?
F.O.S Style

[Chorus: *deep mumbling voice*]
Glide like Silver Surfer
Hit you with the shit while you Skratch the surface
Cause what you hearin is figures people
Men created equals, that's how we read you niggaz

[Solitair]
My rhymes set the world ablaze
So niggaz in the haze
playin' games
but like sheetz they graze
Searchin' for the land
They got caught up in the manz
PLus the horror of my mind left 'em all in a phaze
????
??
???
????
Check auditorium
No story 
without guns
There's never any worry
Caught up in the pyramid
But you stuck at the bottom
Thought you has "Skilz" but you forgot 'em
You remained confused
And tangled in a cabin full of flow will clamity
Please please put ya soul at ease
And stop tryin' to play the role of a criminal
Most mans say my rhyme is subliminal
Thing you got somethin' to say?
But you beat
So you gotta state ya point from six feet deep
No sorrow
I'm headin' for a writer tomorrow
Bout to face you to put it to ya chest
Like Zorrow
Cuz A Nigga may concern it's the horror
Better Know that Solitair's a hard act to follow</pre>
