Baby I missed you.
- I missed you too.
I waited a long time for this.
- So why you ain't come see me, no commisary or nuttin.
I ain't wanna see my bird in no cage.
But I'm ready to take care of you now.
- Now, after three years?
- Three motherfuckin years, nigga you know what {*gun cocks*}

[Verse One]
Hasta la vista, bye bye, kiss ya kid
It's the gangstress, what you think this is nigga
Calm yourself, it's just a little robbery
You got strickin with the poverties, starvin me
Call me sunshine, pussy spread like the rainbow
Spectaculous, miraculous
I practice this for a livin like the buddhism
yom yom rain ge ki
Ask Tina, love ain't got shit to do, with me and you
Or the 44 under the pillow with the dildo
I like to play while I'm workin
and that's for certain, keep jerkin, I ain't done with you
Lights, camera, curtains, in a second
The show begins, invite your family and friends
They gots ta see this, oh they wouldn't believe this
You got stuck and left naked with a hard penis

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It don't take nuttin for you to love me baby
It don't take nuttin for you to love me
If you're feelin like I do then I know you want it too
It don't take nuttin for you to spend a little doe

[Verse Two]
i heard about the carjacks and all the contracts
out on me, by your man Big D
Stink Gucara I bought his life for 3 G's
then some watches, then wet him like galoshes
No need to be mad they already gone
Him and your hitman had somethin goin on
We caught him done at the Shark Bar up in Mark's car
You know the place where the willies are
Always frontin in they ???, sippin Dom P's and Cristies
I reminesce how it used to be
On the run from police we bust shotties out of mazerattis
Bloody bodies in the tel-ly lobbies
When in need I lie for you, cry for you
You know this down ass bitch woulda died for you

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
And I remember, how you said you loved me
with a passion, high fashion, who you askin
to keep the tum numb, from index to thumb
Push the V's with the coke from the DT's
Dope take the titties from city to city
I ain't seen a G off none of them ki's
At ease, when the cops came you gave them my name
Said if Ii didn't snitch you'd make a shorty rich
Bitch I copped the one to three just to see
If all the yayo and boy carryin on the Peter Pan
and Maryland was worth the bitch marryin
this nigga I so worked so hard for
Choose my life to be hardcore
lost in the field no more
Gats I couldn't feel no more
And now I'm the shit
Go by the name of Lil' Kim, The Queen Bitch
And M.A.F.I.A.'s the click, instead of playin Don Dinero
I shoulda been scheming on your cream in the meadow
Don't pay to be nice but it's nice to pay
And if you die before you wake may your soul God take

[Chorus]</pre>
