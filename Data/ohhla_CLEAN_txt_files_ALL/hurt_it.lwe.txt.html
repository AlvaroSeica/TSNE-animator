[Chris Lowe]
My beats'll come down like rain drops and drizzle a lot
Then a little I take my own space
Tune your ear clear so frequencies in the air
Flow floats through amps and 50 watt spares
Regardless you get what sounds I transmit
Touch tingle and taste vibrations of the space
No matter where you are, this sound can get far
Long as your ears can be reached with this audible cause
Check your hearin, take your mind off what you wearin
Uhh I hit the snare and make it snap like a whip
On the soul shit I'm sellin, no commotion
Hypnotizin, like the moon control the ocean
Funky not fancy, I dug to discov' what's hip
It's a trip, funk soul shit rip
Sound that's gon' flow 'bove ground, just like a spirit
Woofer to woofer, tweeter to tweeter, you hear it
I done hurt it

[Chris Lowe]
A slave to the airwaves
See I should funk up the radio but they ain't gon' play me though
I'm too ghetto, I know I'm comin thick, which break I'm gon' pick?
Sell a million underground, make a hit
Who knows, here goes, the drummer with the bass player
Track over track, layer on top of layer
Hey ya got soul kid, yo lay the snare flat
Let me hear that shit go 'round, uh-ah-uh-BAP
Watch me go on without no hooks or no horns
Tracks still get trampled with like 50 different samples
No anvil no banjo, funk not folk
Watch me put it on, no jive and no joke
Like super duper flavor that you found from downtown
to uptown, don't disrespect or interrupt now
Cause point blank that ain't the smart decision
It's like I mentioned, we start shit up just like an engine
I hurt it

[Chris Lowe]
My name'll be up just like graffiti that you see
up on the highway, way down South onto the tri-state
Connecticut, where rhymes start at the predicate
Better get the force, 95 a long course North
Go back and forth to different cities for beats
Trust when your town get down I'll be there to sneak a peak
Hit record stores for more scores of beats
45's, LP's, then I grab some CD's
Headquarters, come and convert it
Switch the pitch a tad bit, just a little bit
so I can hurt it</pre>
