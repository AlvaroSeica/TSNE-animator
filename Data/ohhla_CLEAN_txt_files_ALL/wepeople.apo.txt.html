"Some people have more than others
 Some people were born UGGGG-LY than a motherfucker"

   ("Why it's so cold, to some...")

"Peopleee... Peopleee... Peopleeee..."
"Peopleee..."

[O.C.]
Uh, yo.. Check
Constitutional creeds, what you believe
Nowadays is a different type breed
Declaring independence on these hard knock streets
Laws happen for us, yet young'ns hold heat
Grandmas scared to walk last week, she was robbed by a thief
People dyin over frivolous beef
Respect is minimal, people hold more respect for a criminal
Oblivious, your enemy's a friend of yours
Trust waivers, material things enslave us
Prayin to myself, God save us
Hearts are jaded, sorta like Juice 
when Raheem's mom was hung by the arms of Bishop
Listen, people of color towards each other, ridgid
If one is down, the other treat him like a peasant
True or false, the truth hard to absorb
The proof shows, look at the effects it causes

[Chorus]
On a mission for the people looked down
For the warriors standing their ground, salute for woman and child
We as the people must own up to our valor
Take action against things that's pulling us down
I'd rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
For change and guarantees
The people need to take charge
Get involved and wake up, or forever stay asleep

[O.C.]
Evil affects the hearts of men
Even when they're made aware, they're justifying their sin
There has to be a threshold you won't cross
But of course it's man's nature no to admit when he's wrong
I'm in that same boat tryin to stay afloat
Tryin to take my own advice from the rhymes I write
The older you get, your thoughts mature
Jezebels lure 'em in cause their pockets all full
AZ said it best, "We lust the four devils"
Most are fickle, won't lend your fam not a nickel
People are stone cold, remember, everybody grows old 
So who'll be your keeper when the time creep up
Family bonds these days are not tight
Selfish ways are vicious like a pitbull bite
True or false, the truth hard to absorb
The proof shows, look at the effects it causes

[Chorus]

[O.C.]
Uh, people are shifty, spending time and energy
Warranted paranoia stays with me
Keepin my back against the wall so I can see what's going on
For quick decision-making if I'm thinkin 'bout it
Misery loves company, as opposed 
to seein others doin their thing, and talk smack about 'em
Somebody shot, lying, dyin on the ground
Instead of callin 911, people just crowd around him
The hood's paralyzed
All across these United States eatin off welfares, healthcares
S.S.I. for the ones who can't work
Case workers sit behind a desk grillin your old earth
When they workin for a check themselves, nose up in the air 
Poppin gum with the fake hair and nails
True or false, the truth hard to absorb
The proof shows, look at the effects it causes

[Chorus]</pre>
