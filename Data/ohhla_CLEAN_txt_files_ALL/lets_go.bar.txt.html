[Intro: Lil Jon]
Travis Barker, YEAH!
LET LET LET'S GO! (LET'S GO!)
Lil Jon! Yelawolf!
LET LET LET'S GO! (LET'S GO!)
Twista!
And my homeboy, Busta Rhymes! (LET'S GO!)
Holla at 'em! (LET'S GO!)

[Busta Rhymes]
Be-fore, I, take another minute just to give everybody a move you never seen
and hit 'em with another (ELBOW!)
Let me get up everybody that be movin with {"the conglomerate"}
On your mark, so you're ready {LET'S GO!}
WOW! Okay - here we go again, you see the way I'm blowin in
I'm like a mangler the way that I be manglin the beat
They call me DRACULA when they see the FANGS goin in
WOW! Uh-huh - everybody know that I'ma come and I'ma go (HUH)
Then I gotta do what I been came in to do and body the beat
They love the way we be givin them a show
Keys to the ignition then step on the gas {LET'S GO!}
And bust a bottle and pour me a shot in my glass {LET'S GO!}
Where we at? Where we at? WHERE WE AT?
And we back up in the buildin and be comin with a scorcher
Y'all already know who it is, it's Busta Bust and Travis Barker
Back to the beat, see we gotta go
Hit you with the fire trucks, everybody better know
that we 'bout to let it blow and we gotta get it yo
Everybody if you're really with me {LET'S GO!}

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
HEY! Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's GO! {*4X*}

[Twista]
I already spit it to the rhythm of the piano 
so now I gotta +Give the Drummer Some+
Put the T up on the track'll be phenominal 
cause when it come to havin a hit I'ma make another one
+Blink 182+ times, when you see the Twista with Travis, madness
Kinda like a savage, ravage
A murder with the archlight blood on the canvas, and it's
kind of impeccable how I can spit it 
and get up in the middle with intricate patterns of a kickdrum
Diabolical the lyrical flow
that'll swallow you theoretical thinkin that you can get some
I'ma hit 'em with the Lamborghini flow 
with the speed of a Bugatti {LET'S GO!}
I'm from another planet when I spit a verse 
with the weed in my body {LET'S GO!}
And I'ma, hurt 'em every time I get up in the booth
Sippin on the liquor 182 proof
Mad they wanna say the shit that never let me loose
Out of the cage, now come and see what I'ma do
It's Twista the Jason of rap 
on a track and I'll hit you with the Midwest flow
Even if you ain't ready, yet
all I gotta say is ready, set {LET'S GO!}

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
Yeah, yeah
Drive by hit you with a two-piece combo 
while I'm hangin out the window of your daddy's Lambo
Scrambled eggs, I got scrambled ammo
Leave you on top of the water like a banana boat
Yeah I'm an animal, everybody's edible 
and Yelawolf is headed for yo' arm and yo' hand and yo'
head I'm a cannibal, BUT if it's a man 
hoppin over the fence like a fuckin antelope
SOOOO! Sanitory in a minute when you finish and I'll put him in a vice grip
Put an end to the image and I'll send it to Nivea
End up fuckin with the mic grill
I might skip and pull the trigger back 
in a submarine with the submachine loaded
In an ocean, high deep, even if the submarine imploded
Call my name motherfucker vamanos it's me and I'm sick and the prog-a-nosis
Got more bars then .45, and I'll put you behind them like adios bitch
I can make your momma really proud to know me
And your broke daddy is kinda lonely
Give me fifty bucks in penny rolls just to be in one of my videos
Yeah homie let's go! {LET'S GO!}

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Lil Jon]
Let's go, let's go, let's go, LET'S GO! {*4X*}</pre>
