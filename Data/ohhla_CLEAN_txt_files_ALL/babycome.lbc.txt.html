[Intro]
This goes out to all the brothers and sisters locked down
You've got much love from Tha Dogg Pound and the LBC
(yeah yeah yeahhh)
Your baby is waiting for you to come home

[South Sentrelle]
I got a letter from my babe
Saying he doesn't feel the same
He said all his feelings changed
And he's tired of the games i play
Never thought he knew
About my secret rendezvous
But through all the cheating and the lies
The truth finally came to light (came to light)
Now I'm reading through the lines
(Memories easing) memories easing thorough my mind
Trying to put it all behind
But I'm still asking why
I treated you so bad
I never really knew how much i had
Until you were gone (until you were gone)
And now I'm alone (and now I'm alone)
So baby come home

[Chorus x2]
Baby come home
Where you belong
I know I was wrong
This is my song

I find it hard to rest my head
Tossing and turning in my bed
Late at night it's hard to sleep
Because those memories just keep on flashing in my dreams
At times i feel i have to scream
I just can't keep this pain inside
So i decide to write a letter in return (i go to my letters)
Tell him my lesson has been learned (my lessons been learned)
After all the tables turn
He's my only concern
Because I miss you so much (I'm missing you much)
And I really miss you touch (I'm missing your touch)
And I'm guilty of misusing love
So baby come home

[Chorus x2]
Baby come home
Where you belong
I know I was wrong
This is my song

[through chorus]
Now I apologize for all the cheating and the lies
I know I was wrong
This is my song to you</pre>
