[Intro: Cold 187Um]
OOOOh, wooww, wooww, stay away
OOOOh, wooww, awwoww, stay away
 
[Cold 187Um]
Now see, I be the one or more gang in the Yak
Cause in the Rap game nobody do more love
It's started way way back 
When I was servin' on the side of the Shack
Infact, fools wanna try to see me daily
Whether be the.. shot caller, can't nobody fade me
The untouchable, irresistible, funk to fight
Boo Yaa, I smoke them by the gun
I come from the depth of Cali, P-Town, West up!!
What's your waitin for, tottoo it up
I represent the crew, with that Voo Doo
What you gonna do, when we come through for you?
You better come in peace not war
Cause you just don't know when we might have a straw
I'm a type of nigga smokin' straight from the bong
It smells like a hog, well, I just got my smoke on
And I'ma be high like 7-4-7 with my license plate
Sayin' much love for my county
I probably in the back of the clubs
Spittin' game meditatin, and rollin' up much bud
So we can smoke like the idiot on the resevation
And make peace in the x generation
Cause that's the way it suppose to be
And if it's up to me, homie, I'ma smoke the whole tree
I know, a lot of you really gang relate
So just ride with me, cause it's a mind state
 
[Chorus: with Spanish female AD LIBS]
It's the place we go, where we can free our minds 
It's Endonesia
It's the place we go, where everyday is fine
It's Endonesia
Stay away, stay away
OOOOh, Weeeee, OOOOh, wooww, wooww
 
[PEE GEE]
The bass hit got my tipsy, like Hennessey
Now, tell me can you feel me?
I'm comin' strong like a soldier, I'm garanteed to hold ya
As I bust on Dojah
The snare hits me like a child with a Thrive bag
That's why you hooks surround my vocals like a Zig-Zag
Don't it? - I garantee you won't choke on it
I got the bomb, you got bomb, smoke and vote on it
Shit, the only time I feel gifted, is when I get lifted
 
[Cold 187Um ]
See, you can tell by the smoke at 4th floor free
Cause it be Cold 187Um and the home Girl PEE GEE
And Km.G, rollin' up the pound
Yeah, we're stayin' down like P-Town 
Yo, we roll deep when we creep on the back streets
We're checkin' player haters, we're havin' much heat
We're tryin' to keep it all real over here, man
You can't complain cause all have them things
You got to get up, get out and get his fates
And then maybe we all can relate, yeah
 
[Chorus: with Spanish female AD LIBS]
It's the place we go, where we can free our minds 
It's Endonesia
It's the place we go, where everyday is fine
It's Endonesia
Stay away, stay away
OOOOh, Weeeee, OOOOh, wooww, wooww
 
[Km.G]
Welcome to the world called the beautiful place
Where niggaz just dope flyin, heavenly seditated
Where in the mindstate, when you feel bigger
A little bit stronger than the average nigga
Yeah, we rather co-operate the mood and stick
Maybe get the fly bitches to Re-up on the dick
Awww shit, yeah, you know what?
I hit my nigga Mr. K-Oss to bring the cut
Brush the strap, so we can chill smoke a hell of a sack
Straight Riders and Macks, bitches gettin' table dances in the back
Invited a whole car load, the hoodrats, they wanna get wet
And I ain't been nice tonight, I'm mothafuckin' get nasty
Ain't lettin' one fly bitch pass me
Whores love it when I drop it, my pitfall were screamin' nigga do it
House about dinner for two, four stars cavior
Pimp Clinic kind like reincorse
My niggaz smokin' chronic outta fat ass cigars
Straight chillin' at the bar
 
[Chorus: with Spanish female AD LIBS]
It's the place we go, where we can free our minds 
It's Endonesia
It's the place we go, where everyday is fine
It's Endonesia
Stay away, stay away
OOOOh, Weeeee, OOOOh, wooww, wooww
