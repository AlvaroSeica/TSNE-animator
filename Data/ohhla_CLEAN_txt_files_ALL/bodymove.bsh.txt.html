Typed by: Wammy Giveaway

[Krizz Kaliko *slowed down*]
I-I-I-I...
I like to watch her move slow...

[C-Ballin]
"C-C-C-C-Ballin..."

Chorus: Krizz Kaliko {Krizz Kaliko *slowed down*}
I like to watch her move slow (Uh oh)
Don't move it too fast, take it slow
I like to watch her move slow {Slow}
Slow like siz-erp, but like the way you wiz-erp
Wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz-wiz, I like to watch her move slow (She is)
She make it move just my speed
I-I-I-I...
{I like to watch her move slow}
But don't stop
Make the body rock
Rock-rock-rock, rock

[Verse 1: Paul Wall {Paul Wall *slowed down*}]
Peep game, that girl movin' like baked bread
Neck row turned ring row, great head
Skin tone seems smoother than a water stone
Don't move, girl, let-let me grab my camera phone
Talk to me, baby, you ain't got no man yet
Weekend in the Bahamas, you got plans yet
I'll tell you anythang if I could see that coochie rang
Lay-lay it down like Ballin G {Up on that California cage}
I like to watch her move her body like a rattlesnake
Ass vibrate the room like an earthquake
Slow-slow motion, her body screwed up
It must be some purple in the cup
Cause she movin' so slow {Slow, slow}

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Baby Bash {Baby Bash *slowed down*}]
I kept sippin' on Jemima, sippin' on that molasses
See how big that ass is, I'm higher than {Giraffe tits}
I'm-I'm just checkin' out my draft picks, ass is mad shit
Can slow mo through {3D with no glasses}
Slower than a turtle, a tortoise, harder than rigor mortis {No}
Is there none before us, I'm a Libra, she a-she a Taurus
Re-replay
Grind it out, baby, feed me
Then can call your rear phone, girl, let's have a threeway
I'm-I'm into foreplay, we can do it your way
Just grease your body down, girl, Oil Of Olay
{So} Tell me how you pop that P, win it like a lottery
In and out like a robbery {Baby-baby, get on top of me}

Repeat Chorus

Pre-Verse: Krizz Kaliko
I like the way she move slow, baby making me hot
Call me Usher, she got me like "Oh my God!" (Kali, baby)
I like the way you do that thang
Slow it down, baby, I ain't going nowhere

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Too fast, baby, slow it (Slow it)
I need the T for it (For it)
You the baddest chick in here, and everybody know it (Okay)
Let me see you move it like you got it stuck, a new trick different the one I've been used to
First
Get you over the hotel balcony, rip out the (???)
First
She movin' sluggish like a snail do
Bringin' out the beast in me, I'm a mess up your hairdo
Pour me somethin' sur-pic, when we finished, don't desert me
I might want some more of your sippin', you're like a slurpee
Do it slow (Do it slow...)

Repeat Chorus</pre>
