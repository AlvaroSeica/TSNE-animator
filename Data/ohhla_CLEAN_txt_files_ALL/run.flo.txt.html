Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Run, run, run, run, the revolution has begun
Run, run, run, run, the revolution has begun
Run, run, run, run, the revolution has begun
Run, run, run, run, run until the rising sun

[Verse 1]
It used to be stupid to say 'revolution'
We way over used it, daze and confusion
Looped it out, rallies and felt a deep therapy
Put it on TV to sell a Jeep Cherokee
But invariably, seekers seek clarity
Secrets leak, people retweet like a parakeet
Used to be no sign of hope, now it's show time
Compassion as fast as you can. Go time

What are we running from? What are we running for?
Hungry gun punishment or better metaphors?
Burma to Tucson the movement is medicine
Turn our potential into kinetic force
With courage we set a course
Where freedom doesn't ring it roars
Follow the drinking gourds
Guided by an inner north
We're not running to it but we know what we're running for

[Chorus]
Run, run, run, run, the revolution has begun
Run, run, run, run, the revolution has begun
Run, run, run, run, the revolution has begun
Run, run, run, run, run until the rising sun

If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I
If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I
If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I
If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I

[Verse 2]
We run to horizon line, not confusing finish lines
Call you to witless ministers, it's "Can I get a witness?" time
Split these rhymes like picket signs
Phillistines in skittish minds
For con-fined refugees slaving in pantomime
[?]
In packing plants out of sight, out of mind it's business time
If we don't dig it, let's undermine it
We run from the dark and
Unbearable lightness into defiance
Where our sun shines brightest

The revolution has begun
The clever youth that had to run
Cause we were shooting at 'em
Guns from every roof the flags were hung
As shards of glass were flung
The women came and added on
They said no one could ever ever do
And they inspired us from Babylon to Avalon
We saw that they were headed somewhere fast and tried to tag along
Like a vagabond, so we battle on
All over the map it's time to sprint
It's a decathalon, everybody

[Chorus]
Run, run, run, run, the revolution has begun
Run, run, run, run, the revolution has begun
Run, run, run, run, the revolution has begun
Run, run, run, run, run until the rising sun

If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I
If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I
If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I
If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I
If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I
If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I
If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I
If the sun will rise even one more time, so will I. So will I</pre>
