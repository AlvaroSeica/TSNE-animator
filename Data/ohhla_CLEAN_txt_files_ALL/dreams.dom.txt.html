[Domo Genesis]
Now if I see it in my dreams
is it for real somebody tell me what it means?
Sometimes it ain't really what it seems
Cause this could all really be a dream - is it a dream?
Is it a dream? Am I livin what I'm seein in my sleep?
Or is my imagination trippin off the weed?
Is this all the shit I really see
in my dream? Is this a dream?
Do my dreams make it that good?
Or will I always try to do better than last year?
I'm not afraid of what the future brings
Is this a dream? A vivid dream? It's in my dreams
Already see it in my dreams</pre>
