So what if life's a bitch
Spread her lips and fuck her
till her mother has a miscarriage
and we never exist
Letter to the editor
wish it was better than this
Forever resist settling for the message
or the medicine's grip
Put up a fist, refuse to enlist
We reminisce in the mist with a knife to wrist
Slice the rich, fight the fake righteousness
Life's a risk, fuck it I'm a light the wick
Throw a molotov at a cop hauling off
Speeding up the freeway to the sprawling mob
DDay for the falling off
Calling shots, rotten cause
Never good enough to rob
Guilty until proven not
Victimizing is their job
Right wing racists give the props
Propoanda built to wash
Countries white with hateful flaws
Systematic hate enforced
peace activists take the loss
Countdown to the martial law
rrrrrrat fire down your doors
While the president applauds

----

We didn't start the fire
But we supplied the gasoline
to burn this mother fucker higher
It's time to expose the liars
Selling their stock before it drops
and they're forced to retire

We didn't start the fire
But we supplied the gasoline
to burn this mother fucker higher
It's time to expose the liars
Selling their stock before it drops
and there's no survivors

----

Black clouds surround
When I write this down
Cities and towns pity resounds
victory sounds like fifty fifty thousand pound
hydrogen rounds
Hitting the ground
splitting the fire that crowns
the violence we've found
Try to be down so fucking hard praise god
Raise your guard before
the blaze scars today's flaws
Create wars to sedate the doubt that we regard
As a threat behind the debt without cause
Enforced until we're lost in the land of divorce
Off course towards the apocalyptic source
With no remorse for the fourth
that never get the reward
Sticking the sword in their backs
saying it's for the lord
Rocking truth as a toxic youth
Stalking proof lost in exhausting views
Cut the salute duck em
and shoot buckle the noose
Around the neck of what you abuse
and strut your motherfucking excuse</pre>
