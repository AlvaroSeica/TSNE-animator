Now this ain't yo' average dog...
This dog stays on the grind...
Buries his bone everywhere he goes
and don't love hoes
Stays connected...
His game well perfected...
From the streets of Tacoma and Seattle
He's well respected...
He's a rare breed...
This thug shit he bleeds...
He's my partner
Mister D.O.G.
