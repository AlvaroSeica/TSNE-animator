Me and Raph Boogie came to take the jar with your last cookie
You ain't that hard, you're rookie
Better get the barbie cooking, I'm like a starving woman
With a bonus cushion to ease the pushing
Looking for that next meal, get real
Let's deal, kept real, fresh meals, eggs feel
Caressed, the wheel keeps spinning
The hater's kept me driven and the fans kept me swinging
And the hand kept me spitting - rhythm
Fossick through the garbage cans
Your lies a starving man's party jam, aiyyo smarty pants!
You better tighten them lips, you fire and miss
While I'm never tired of this, I spied a rip
I'll ride the trip back to school to snatch a batch of your lunch - money
I'll get trashed and crash your test - dummies
I react with a rash cause I'm so - hungry
And your raps are wack and crummy

"I still got the hunger pains"

[Raph Boogie]
Oh! You with the mic is like a cook with a blunt knife
Or chef who just can't get the recipe right
You don't excite taste, you just waste time
And I've been running this long while, can't take mine
We get erratic for these hip-hop fanatics
And girls who just like what they hear, yo these vocals is clear!
All them years hey we paid them dues
Probably overpaid now who's got my change?
Keep it! And heres another tip, keep it!
Don't rush but don't let your laziness crush
Find the balance, like your tight-roping the challenge
Unsatisfied, sneakers couldn't get me by
I'm hanging with the population, we killing em all
They couldn't take a step forward, we filling em all
Minds are small like they scared of rap
It's being taken from them but I won't be fearing that

"I still got the hunger pains"

[Muph]
You see I represent the underdogs, they say I come across soft
But I don't really give a tosh, you fucker!
I work the gutters, to move the numbers
And soothe the hunger, what's to lose you sucker prove your butter
I kept my vision sitting close by
Lonely lowlife, silk shirt and a bow tie
Won't watch opportunity go by
Got too much on this to flow lies, so I
Kept striding with my best riding in the foreground
Sharpening the skills till they're worn out
Swords drawn out, here to take small amounts
On the corporate accounts, unheard of
With a thirst to work till my nerves burst and they turn off
Started with a little something, morphed into the Muphin
Found a humming instinct to follow
Gave em something a little hard to swallow

{*Scratches*}
"I still got the hunger pains"

[Raph Boogie]
I don't need speed or meth to get the junk
I'm hitting like a hit in the throat, finger in the lump
Swallow it down, as I tarnish your crown
The entire Crookneck Fam HATE, we spit fire
My empire built on skill alone
Whilst you're out on crutches, you can't hold your own
The life forces heat, so we forced to eat
And I'm starving like this steakhouse just the night we meet
You can't front! Yo this is Hungry Raphs
With an upsize just to break your back
I got a fire in the belly that just can't be matched
And a dedication to my crew I won't detach
Simple plan, feed the seeds to grow
Whether you're working on the night shift getting that doe
You gotta provide, PLUS! Keep the passion alive
PLUS! Stay pure, Raph and Muphin unmodified
