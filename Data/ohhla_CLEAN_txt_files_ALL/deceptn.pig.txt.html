[Intro]
Shake it off. Lord, I won't do this song
This is a fight with myself
I wanna gain much wealth
I wanna live by myself
But I'm surrounded by..
I'll keep that to myself
I'm so stupid

[Verse]
Well hello my little friends and look at them run
I'm still at home with no ends and look at them run
Hopping in a tricked out Benz and look at them run
While I'm clocking in as a temp look at them run
It is too late now to affect the whole world, or is it just dated now?
They could care less who invaded now
Really am I silly with the dreams of the milli'?
Top billing with a big fat record deal-ly
First I buy a house way up on the hill-ly
Then I get a girly dressed like Mr. Furley
Met her in Nashville or was it Philly?
Her hair so curly and look at me burly
But my dream deferred, I felt the same words that Langston heard
I watched them pass and it seemed absurd
A decade of dreaming
And it seeming that they just run away with my verbs
And its..

[CHORUS]
Deception. Look at them dancing in the field goal
Deception. I look at me and I'm getting old
Deception. How many records have I really sold?
Deception. Whoops I did it again boy. (2X)

[Verse]
Ten years ago I woke up with a dream in my hand
Ran for a couple of yards, but tripped and fell to my hands
And then got up because the Lord Almighty told me He can
Ran for a couple of more, and tripped and fumbled again
And people asking what you getting up for go get a job
but I gotta carry out this dream or my life I rob
And when I'm gonna work for 45 years up in the mall
And when I'm old and gray wondering where's my calling?
And I'd rather die now than never wonder how
Never ever try now
Coulda' woulda' shoulda' will be
All I sigh how Can I live a mediocre
Life and not ever ask you why
Are we hear specifically not mundane
But a gifted people
We must shine and it must be equal
Live your life cause there is no sequel
Oh it's a reception

[CHORUS]

[Bridge]
Hey, Hey, wait I'm called to do something
I don't know exactly what it is but I'm hunting
Getting lost in this record biz and I'm fumbling
Oops I did it again boy
(REPEAT)

[CHORUS] (2x)</pre>
