Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Ooooh yeah
I can't believe I can't believe
I can't believe I can't believe
What happened last night, I'm barely sober
I think I need I think I need
I think I need I think I need to come back down
The party's over
There were two drunk girls in the bathroom
My boy's dad came home, he was mad cool
Had the time of my life, it all felt right
Can't believe that we gone do the same thing tonight

[Verse 1]
I hope the weather man calls for sunshine
I woke up drunk with my girl on my mind
I only think about it sometimes
I wish her dad would call me son at least one time
Whatever. I take a sip of this Dom Pizzy &amp; gets busy
I hope this pizza from last night can get me right
I hope my cell phone's charged; aww shit, it's not
I guess I'll wear the same thing; shit it's all I got
Wasted, Faded, really shit faced-ed
Yeah this is my life &amp; I wouldn't wanna change it
We go all out; party till we fall out
If you do the same holla, ooooh yeah

[Chorus]
I can't believe I can't believe
I can't believe I can't believe
What happened last night, I'm barely sober
I think I need I think I need
I think I need I think I need to come back down
The party's over
There were two drunk girls in the bathroom
My boy's dad came home, he was mad cool
Had the time of my life, it all felt right
Can't believe that we gone do the same thing tonight

[Verse 2]
Smashing on rum like it's iced tea
Hatin' niggas mad cause they girl like me
I'm just tryin to live my life
Straight rage is the kinda shit that we like
We had the house part hotter than a griddle
Neighbors bugging out they was knocking on the window
There was mad cute girls; booties juicier than skittles
Cups in the sky man pour me up a little
Oh uh-oh, here come the cops y'all
Yeah, Everybody got low
Get everyone who ain't 21 up outta here
What they doin' here
They ain't supposed to be
Wasted, faded, really shit faced-ed
Yeah this is my life and I wouldn't wanna change it
We go all out, party till we fall out
If you do the same holla, oooh yeah

[Chorus]
I can't believe I can't believe
I can't believe I can't believe
What happened last night, I'm barely sober
I think I need I think I need
I think I need I think I need to come back down
The party's over
There were two drunk girls in the bathroom
My boy's dad came home, he was mad cool
Had the time of my life, it all felt right
Can't believe that we gone do the same thing tonight.</pre>
