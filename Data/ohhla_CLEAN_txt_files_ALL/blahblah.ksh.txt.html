[Ke$ha]
Ahhh-AHHHHHH
Badda da dah, badda da bah bah
Comin out'cha mouth with'cha blah blah blah
Zip, your lip like a padlock (sh'yeah)
And meet me in the back with the jack at the jukebox
I don't really care where you live at (nah)
Just turn around boy, let me hit that
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat
Just show me where your dick's at

Music starts, listen hot stuff I'm in love
with this song, so just hush
Baby, shut up! Heard enough

[Chorus]
Stop talk talk talkin that blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be gettin this? Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car, ar, ar
If you keep talkin that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

[Ke$ha]
Boy c'mon, get my rocks off
Come put a little love in my glove box
Wanna dance, with no pants on? (HOLLA!)
Meet me in the back with the jack at the jukebox
So cut to the chase kid
Cause I know you don't care what my middle name is
I wanna be naked and you're wasted

Music's up, listen hot stuff I'm in love
with this song, so just hush
Baby, shut up! Heard enough

[Chorus]

[3OH!3]
You be delayin you always sayin some {shit}
You say I'm playin I'm never layin the dick
Saying blah, blah, blah
Cause I don't care who you are in this bar
It only matters, who I is-{*repeats ever faster*}

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be gettin this? Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car, ar, ar
If you keep talkin that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Ohhh! Blah blah blah
Stop talkin!!
Stop talk talk talkin that</pre>
