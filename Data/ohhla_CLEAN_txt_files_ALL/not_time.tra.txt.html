(*talking*)
(living my life), let me talk to em
You need to pay attention to the truth, you know it's in
For every death brings new life, and with new life
Our chances are limited, (when it's not my time)
They say it's limited by the experiences, that we may come across
On a day to day basis, it's limited by the circumstances
Of us being less fortunate in life, they say it's limited
By the spirit and the hope that we have, that everybody try to take from ya
But then it's unlimited, when you find peace with God
Come take a walk through the hood with me
 
[Trae]
Where faith is at a lower level, cause pressure is hard
Thirty years in the cell, will leave a killer acquainted with God
Going to war with pain'll leave you internally scarred
Watching the world crash, is kinda odd
We in the last days, is what they telling me
Eight year old children, being convicted of a felony
Never had a life stereotype, for what they bread to be
Mama did, daddy probably something they will never see
The economy under fire, we owe it to Bush
That's why the hood spend most of they days, blowing president kush
The way he left us feeling, barely gave us a reason to push
Unless he on the verge of suicide, and we give him a push
Katrina came and left our neighbors, with some deadly weather
And off the rip, I beg the Lord to try to make it better
I feel they pain, so now I ride with em like it's whatever
Yeah I represent for New Orleans, and Texas together
I got a kite the other day, from my homies on lock
They begged me not to switch up like the rest, look here homie I'm not
I promise every chance I get to roll, I'm coming to rock
I'm in these penitentiary walls, till they tell me to stop
And it's murder by the many, on another scale
Sirens and a couple shots, that mean another body still
And if we see it, rules got us unable to tell
My heart goes out, to no mo' victims who done been through hell
Just trying less, that by these cowards who ain't men at all
Long as I'm breathing, I ain't gon' let these cowards win at all
And for my people I'ma stand up, till a soldier fall
I'm so serious, ain't no need for me to grin at all
And on another note, my lil' homie mama is a smoker
I promise I wanna help, but she duck off when I approach her
I'm so sensitive to the pain, that I'm numb
Put the world against me, on my babies I ain't fin to run
And speaking of babies, I'm seeing babies having babies
Hoe ass niggaz running through these kids, like they grown ladies
They told me life was gon' get better, when Obama win
And I agree, long as he don't switch up in the end
My brother been in the pen, a little over ten
I gotta send him pictures, just to help him live again
I let him know it's no limit, how far this hand extend
If I gotta die to see him free, then I'll be checking in that's on my spirt homie
 
[Lynzie Kent]
The voltures, are coming
They're hunting, for your blood
They're circling the streets
But don't give them, what they want
Don't give them what they want, no
And I know, you got a secret
And it's causing you pain
So babe unload, believe it
It won't hurt you again, it won't hurt you again
It won't hurt you again, it won't hurt you again
I look through these eyes, and these eyes only
I live through this life, sometimes it's lonely
I look through these eyes, and these eyes only
I live through this life, sometimes it's lonely
Sometimes it's lonely
Living my life, my life my life</pre>
