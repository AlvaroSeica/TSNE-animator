[GANGSTA RED]
Gangsta Red touch you down to the head
I got a 9 for the Crabs, a Mac-10 for the Feds
It ain't nuthin' but a Villain thing
Always prepared, never scared to die
Rollin' through the 'hood
Puffin' a dub-sack
The Eastside fits it where the gangsta Bloods at
5.000 and 6 to the hundred
Spotted E-Ricket draw down and gun it
Fuck E-Rickets man, fuck E-Rickets
Bloostone Villains gon' get it twisted
And to these suckers True Flue
You know what they do
Put the 9 in your head and catch a bullet or two
Break-break up 1-9 E-Rickets do you hear me?
It's Gangsta Red on the mic, flown freely
From B-S-B-G-5-6-S-T
See 1-8-7 so Bloods don't stress me

[Member of BLOODSTONE VILLAINS]
It's the B-gang punks
Chumps and wimps
Don't get it twisted straight Villains not pimp
You might seen a ?? a little B in comin'
We just slappin' bitches
On Crab, we bombin'
Get paid, we not afraid
Fuckin' with the Villains and you gon' get sprayed
The notorious, oh so glorious
5-Deuce Villain can't nobody fuck with us
V-I-L-L-A-I-N, count to ten
And you find that you can't win
East Side of L.A. is where we dwelled
Dissin' all Crab, so fool don't tell
It's already known that Crabs Run In Pack
So all E-Rickets just suck a bozack
Representin' Five-Deuce Villain Gangstas
Fuck with us, recall go to hang ya
I put a slug in your ass or maybe deuce
Smoke that ass like a motherfucking deuce on get loose
On all Rickets, Crab, whoever
Losin' a battle, Villains never
B-L-O-O-D-S
So Crabs don't stress
It ain't nuthin' but a Bloodstone Villains time

[Chorus]
5 thousand 6 hundred 5
Bloodstone Villains killing Crab on the spot
5 thousand Deuce hundred 5
Bloodstone Villains killing Crab with the crime

[Member of BLOODSTONE VILLAINS]
Straight from the heart, Blood I tell you this
Shootin' that crickets uh, I don't miss
Aimin' at the 5.0 for a target
I thought he was a Ricket
But damn I hit a soldier
Shot him in the head
I caught layin' him dead
Puttin' in work, who give a fuck about the Feds
Claimin' the East Side
The Rollin Fifty's
Who give a fuck about Rickets
They all Sissies
Runnin' In Packs
They better watch they back
Cause the Bloodstone Villains caught you Crabs off the Mac
Puttin' a mean check
Leavin' a man all wrecked
You know gangstas in the hood
They get respect
Here we go again on the smoke roll
Five-Deuce, Five-Six Villains goin' on the Crab patrol
Takin' out Crabs on sight, young Rickets
OG's, it don't matter what you look like
And if you dressed in blue
It's only clue for me to do what I'm gonna do
I'm a gangsta, straight up tear this
Takin' out Crabs to give a way I don't care about this
I do it for fun, keepin' Crabs on the run
I gotta gun
Go get a bulletproof vest son
And protect yourself, for your good health
I put your bitch very up on the shells
Because I'm gonna move you from the ground
Have you stretched out in the box slapped to the ground
And when I'm hangin' don't test me
Chillin' like a Villain so Blood don't stress me, stress me

[Chorus]
5 thousand 6 hundred 5
Bloodstone Villains killing Crabs on the spot
5 thousand Deuce hundred 5
Bloodstone Villains killing Crab with the crime

[GANGSTA RED]
Five-Six, Five-Deuce
And ?? on the Seven
It's Gangsta Red straight flowin' from the head
Checkin' you suckers
Because you're nuthin' but bustas
Cowards In The Pack if you know it's always like that
So fuck you Crabs with your weak-ass raps
It's Gangsta Red on the motherfuckin' mic
And you know we just don't stop
So watch me as I turn this motherfucker out
Two deads ??? equal five
Motherfuckin' Crabs that ain't alive
I did it with the quickness, not care about the witness
Now tell me can you hang with the sickness?
And yeah, it's only right
I jack the Crabs for his ?? just the other night
They all on my shit
Front, back
Hittin' the pancake switch
Rollin' down the Ave and what do I be?
Some motherfuckin' Crabs fall around behind me
So I hit the corner
Reach for my strap goddamn rippin' peel some more Crabs cap
Villain's the game, kill is the thing
Understand what I'm sayin' man
It's just a motherfuckin' Villain time
So Blood don't stress me</pre>
