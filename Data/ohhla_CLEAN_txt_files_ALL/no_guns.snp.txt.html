[Snoop Lion and Cori B]
Money makes a man and that's a crime
If we all were rich, we'd spend more time
With our daughters and sons, they're losing their minds
We all feel hurt, here's mine, hear me now

[Chorus: Snoop Lion and Cori B]
Cause, no guns are allowed, in here tonight
We're gonna have a free-for-all, no fights..
I wanna get lost in the crowd, in here tonight
I need to hear my thoughts, turn the music up loud

[Snoop Lion] (Cori B)
Let the music play, me no wan no more gunplay
When the bodies hit the ground, there's nothing left to say, ay, ay
Me no wan to see no more innocent blood shed..
Me no wan fi see no more youth dead.. (Come hear me now!)

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah... 
News from back home, this when it hurts to be gone
Two more young names to be carved out of stone
One summer day that went horribly wrong
Got my dawg on the phone, cryin and sayin to leave him alone
But I'm not leavin his side, I know that somebody died
Somebody's child, some people ducked down and some people hide
Some people just cannot react in time
Bullets do not choose a victim, it is the shooter that picks 'em
They just can't wait to get you in the system
The district attorney could use a conviction
Told you no guns and then you didn't listen
Life is so heavy with that on your soul
Dedicate this to Shyanne and Josh
And pour somethin out for the lives that they stole -- 416

[Chorus]

[Outro: Snoop Lion and Cori B]
Money makes a man and thats a crime
Money makes a man and thats a crime
I wanna get lost in the crowd, in here tonight..
