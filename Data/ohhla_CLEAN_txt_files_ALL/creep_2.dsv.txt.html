[D-Sisive]
At a shop window, he stares at a custom made leather shoe
It glows like the hull of a conquistador ship
Starting price? Five grand
Would it leave a trail of slug slime wherever he walked?
Would hummingbirds fly from dress print jackorandas
to feast on the ghastly sweetness of that trail?
Would the walk turn to a run?
Past the stately brick buildings, past projects
Past the fire pits where kids roast plastic dollar store
Halloween masks of cats and pigs
Past the last brittle bone street lamp
and out onto the boiled peach skin surface of the river?
Would it float? Would it chart a course backward through history?
Would it stomp on each image in the kingdom of images?
He lingers there at the window and wonders
Knowing it's creepy to linger, maybe even to wonder
Then a sewer rat slides out from inside of the shoe
like a magician's rabbit, and stares at him
And doesn't seem afraid</pre>
