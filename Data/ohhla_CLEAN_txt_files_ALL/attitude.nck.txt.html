Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's like me and you
Me and my mans and your girlfriends too
After tonight I'ma only visit you when the moon is blue
Is that your man right there? What he doin' with you?

Sayin' talk to the hands, is that still cute?
Jimmy Choo boots, that's real cute
Only chick in the place with style and grace
And like, 5'8" with a tropical face

And like, expensive taste, spotted my chain, that's right
Get on my game, gotta see well hear that
Is that a weave can't believe that I said that
I don't know what possessed you to wear that

Girl, you out of tap? Girl, wear that
Wait to be not, make it hot, man, you feel that?
Smashin' all across the states
And I stays iced out like frosted flakes

Anythin' you really wanna do, I'm with that
Only wanna kick it with you, I'm with that
Meet me in the parkin' lot at two, I'm with that
But you gotta quit that attitude and get back to me

I don't know you
My name's not important, I'm as big as Elvis
You think you're so cute
Keep it real ma, you don't know me like that dance

But I don't want to
Believe me I don't give up that easy, girl
'Cuz I kinda like your attitude

I done been to every club in the world
I seen them hot chicks and they blockin' and ugly home girls
And ninety nine percent of the time
It be hits like this brain washin' your mind

Yo, you lookin' at my watch, just watchin' the time
You think I'm gonna stop you must be out of your mind
If you ain't V.I.P, then get out of the line
Think I woke up one day and just decided to rhyme, nah

I ain't got no problems with ya'll
We all ken I'm tryin' to find a Barbie doll
So I could get a phone number, call her tomorrow
Ask her, how her night went with a superstar
Yeah, that's what I was shootin' for

I'm one hundred percent over the fence
You like a mad mechanic throw in a wrench
And my game mad 'cuz you playin' the bench

Anythin' you really wanna do, I'm with that
Only wanna kick it with you, I'm with that
Meet me in the parkin' lot at two, I'm with that
But you gotta quit that attitude and get back to me

I don't know you
My names not important, I'm as big as Elvis
You think you're so cute
Keep it real ma, you don't know me like that dance

But I don't want to
Believe me I don't give up that easy, girl
'Cuz I kinda like your attitude

It's your attitude that got me whipped in my whip
Like whips you [?] I can't be mad at you
Lookin' good, you remind me of my Benz
When I'm pushin' through the hood
24 inch rims steerin' wheel all good
Envision the bigger picture for real it's all good

Wouldn't ya'll do it if ya'll could?
If ya'll could, wouldn't ya'll do it?
But ya'll ain't for stardom
On the road from autumn to autumn
From Cali to Atlanta to Atlanta to Harlem
You don't need Burt Reynolds for the Cannonball run

Anythin' you really wanna do, I'm with that
Only wanna kick it with you, I'm With that
Meet me in the parkin' lot at two, I'm with that
But you gotta quit that attitude and get back to me

I don't know you
My names not important, I'm as big as Elvis
You think you're so cute
Keep it real ma, you don't know me like that dance

But I don't want to
Believe me I don't give up that easy, girl
'Cuz I kinda like your attitude

Jam on it, jam on it
I said, jam jigga jigga jam on it
Get out of your seats and dance to ghetto beat
Girl, don't be shy, just flaunt it

Jam on it, jam on it
I said, jam jigga jigga jam on it
Get out of your seats and dance to ghetto beat
Girl, don't be shy, just flaunt it</pre>
