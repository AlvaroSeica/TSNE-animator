[Verse 1]
Got the mind of a maniac
I'm having visions of murder that's why I'm sayin that
Ignore that going to jail I ain't playin that
I mastered the art of getting away with slaying cats
I can't bealive you're sayin that
Cause I'm sick minded
Kill a parkin nobody who can't find it
And you can't find the murder weapon
A stashed spot, that's what the burners kept in
I'm destroying the evidence 
I'm wipin the prints and checkin forms irrelevant
There's blood smudges in the bathroom 
and a bloody shoeprint that's going towards the backroom
Bullet holes in the wall and broken glass too
And find your body by the backdoor where I blast you
Now who did this
as if you had to ask who
It's Myke Miers and it's killing spree part 2 ah

[Hook]
Now there ain't no change in me
It used to be hard but now it ain't no thang to me
To go into a niggas house
put a pistol in his mouth
and blow his fuckin brains out

[Verse 2]
I'm sending cats to post motem
I just kill 'em all and let the core in the sodom
My objective is to flaw 'em 
My skills is real they fabulous like the forum
They call me Mr.Slicy Dice shoes, ?? whatever if the price is right
We can't negotiate your fate it's too late
You're another funeral candidate
Fatal wounds get inflicted with a snub nose biscuit
your father organs get twisted
That's what happens when you come see me
multiple stab wounds write my name in bloody grafitti
Do you even know what you're dealin with?
A lunitic with an appetite for killin shit
They say Myke Miers is pure evil
I had to do it twice Killing Spree The Sequel ah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They call me Mykill ?? the king of killing sprees 
The master of the murder shit
I mapped out ways to make you blackout by pulling the mac down
i wish you would act out
You'll learn a valuable lesson 
The way you learn the value of my Smith &amp; Wesson
I wish you would get your crew too
That's more reasons for me to put these bullets through you
See I ain't playin with a full deck
I got a full clip and I wish you would test
See you're dealing with a mad man
I'm putting body's from trash cans on tash can 
You wanna hear the Wu boo then ask Cam
I slash niggas like Zorro call me the masked man
My mindstate is to murder people
I had to do it twice Killing Spree The Sequel ah
