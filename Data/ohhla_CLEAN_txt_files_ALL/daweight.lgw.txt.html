[Verse One]
We here son, I'm tellin you thugs and fake ones
Don't blaze one, just eat the bread that I break son
Trying to stop me, leavin stuck on phase one
We here son, ain't goin nowhere until we done
Take a track from Jay-Z, and flip back like crazy
Claimin you God, but look more like Patrick Swayze
Believe it you gonna lie, believe it you gonna ride
By the words that we speak, you gonna live or die
Like it's time for the real ones to step it up
Like it's time for the killaz son to shut it up
It's been along time, no longer the wait
Don't wan't no food for the thought, get away from the plate
Blasphemy dog, you a no name God
Heaven is gonna frown, on your whole lame squad
Roc-a-fella crew frontin like you hard
Can't even step up on the streets without your bodyguard
So listen up Hova, the wait is over
You losin all your luck, like a 3 leaf clover

[D.C.P.]
Bandana head rockers, hell's most wanted
Biblical heat busters, raw beef you don't want it
It's bad for your blood, C-walk all over your whole crew
Christ walk with cats like us come thru
You got a prob, take it up with Elohim
Think you stoppin us, then playa wake up out your dream
We got bodyguards bigger than your whole team
Snatchin souls out of y'all, my click be unseen
Better turn your life around like a U'ie
Cuz you headin straight to the fire, like a fat dubie
Getting chocked up in the back of the club
Marijuana, liquor souls snatchin you thugs
Not even knowin what the bartender be pourin
Drunker, I ain't goin
Hittin the gates, I'm talkin about the pearly ones
Not runnin from feds, Hittin gates
We heaven bound
Gold streets, Dubs clean
No bullet proofs Lacs, Devil's bustin at me
Dirty south scene, I seen it all
Baller blow up, baller must fall

[Chorus]
Wanna live your life
So
Go ahead and get high
No
Before you lose your life
Boy
The weight is over
The world waiting on us
Got the whole world son waiting on us
So when we step up on this game
Don't be hatin on us
I see you all grilled up like you ready to bust
We tired of this crap
They waitin on us

[Verse Two]
W-I-S-E seekin for souls
I come to snatch 'em up out the fire, son hit 'em and roll
I know that you thug livin, the way that you drug dealin
You say that you God fearin, I know that you love women
Comin thru the hood like you rougher than rough
But in the presence of my God, you just a speckle of dust
And it's time to bow down, confess it to God
Cuz you always grillin up, frontin thinkin you hard
Bullets ricashay on your hundred grand dream car
Ego trippin like the whole world know who you are
You ain't ready for it, but don't mean that you won't get it
Like you talk about God, don't mean that you gonna live it
Everybody wanna thug, nobody walkin in love
Homie Christ shed His blood, while you lettin off slugs
Eminem I know you claim to be thug
You wanna talk about Britney Spears, but won't talk about Suge
Cuz if you do son, be on the next hit list
And when he come up out the joint, get your whole wig split
Wanna keep it gangsta, then baby boy keep it real
Knowin you sayin anything, so the people will think you real
Know that you Slim Shady, time to switch it up
It's time for the real one to please stand up

[Chorus]</pre>
