[Tyler, the Creator]
My life? Screw it
with a drunk bitch like what the fuck are we doin?
We're kissin, I'm wheezin, it's time to play Tetris
I play piano, jack off, I'm anorexic
I'm fuckin asthmatic, my records problematic
Talkin to myself because my therapist done had it
All the racial slurs from the wipsters playin from Lenny Kravitz
Love locked down like I am some sort of faggot
but I'm not in the first place
Waiting on my dad to say hi on my birthday
Cause Jesus wouldn't even be my friend on Church Day
I plan on gettin back {*edited out*} the worst way (bitch!)
In the jungle, I planned on the keeper
Inside of the cage cause I'm a motherfuckin zebra
Obama's in office, niggaz get job like teachers
Lookin at retarded kids screamin out "Fuck slob Jesus"

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
And I can write a hook fast, I can get straight to the cash
Y'all niggaz come last, I'm first though
(Ay!)... No rehearsal, I know it all like Urkel
You can call it commercial
So turn it up, turn it up (watch it) {*3X*}
Odd Future won't stop it

[Tyler, the Creator]
I make music for a reason
Didn't vote Obama so you can charge me with treason
Year round asshole, the fuck you season
The flu, I'm sick, that's why everybody sneezin (ACHOO~!)
I'm always cheesin, smile for a reason
Fuck as I fuck you, I'm always teasin
My daughter need milk and a quilt
so I'm sellin the the haze for six bucks, cause she always sneezin
Some people need drugs, some people need dubs
on they car note to go to the club
But really, really, really
All I need deep down... is a hug

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
Look! I'm back like niggaz on a bus
with a Rosa Parks state of mind, I don't give a fuck
And I'm strollin down South like Good Luck Chuck
in a Malcolm X shirt chillin with the Ku Klux
+Clan+, I +Ain't Nuttin' Ta Fuck Wit+
O.F. clan they ain't nothin to fuck with
The O.F. clan they ain't nothin to fuck with
This +Black Snake Moan+ is somethin to suck bitch
(Bitch, drop it)
(O.F.M., bang on your FM)
(Tyler, the Creator; uhh)
(Yeah)</pre>
