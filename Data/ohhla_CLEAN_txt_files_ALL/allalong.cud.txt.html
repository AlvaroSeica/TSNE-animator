[Intro]
Hey! ... Ma-ma-ma, ma-moon {*2X*}

[Kid Cudi]
When the days, change
So does my attitude
I'm messy at home
I ate a lot of junk food
When the nights, change
So do my nightmares too
I dream reality
is my dream

[Chorus]
All along, all along
I guess, I'm meant, to be alone
All along, all along
I guess, I'm meant, to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah

[Kid Cudi]
When the weeks, change
The rumors change too
I'm addicted to highs
But would you like to know why?
When the months, change
So do my love point of views
I don't want what I need
What I need hates me {*2X*}

[Chorus]
I know all along, all along
I know, I'm meant, to be alone
It's crazy
But all along, all along
I knew I was meant, to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah

[Kid Cudi]
I suppose somehow the lionhearted, failed to win
Who will be the villain? All the strangers, voted for him
I suppose somehow the lionhearted, failed to smile
Who will be the villain? All the strangers, voted for him

[Chorus]
All along, all along
I guess, I'm meant, to be alone
All along, all along
I guess, I'm meant, to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah</pre>
