[Daffy Duck sample]
Let's see you sneak out of this
You silly little rodents...

[Li-Mouse]
I travel across the land of hot sands
Battle ready hands, on my command
I slay only those, who betray and demand
Body mats lay around me, but I stand
Speak not one word to those, I don't trust
Keep my blades clean to avoid the rust
And sharpened, to cut through any solid
The blade alone carries such knowledge
How to move through to hit, vital components
Sure to move swift never losing to opponents
Wild pronouns, it's about to go down
You feel the sharp edge, before, you heard the sound
Wind speeds, that exceed tropical storms
Question how I perform, after flesh is torn
Stand unshaken and firm, when you attack first
Uncontrollable actions occur, to quench the thirst
A vital fluid, staining the ground, unrehearsed
The Tokyo street crimes made the 'angels burst'
Try to attack from the back, man, I hate those
Cats that sold soul for power like Kratos
You ain't a God of War if you ain't come close to death
Your lungs filled with air, your final breath
You saw the bright white light, and you took a glance
But you have a purpose and blessed with another chance

[Chorus: Cno Evil]
The shelter from the rain, you will not have pain
You are not insane, that is just your brain
That is just your name, that is just a game
When it goes down to the bones, we are just the same
You are just a person, yearning for learning
When your heart is turning, it means your soul is burning
The shelter from the rain, for those this is concerning
Travel light years right back for the returning

[Cno Evil]
This is the life, the one you always --- nah, chill
I'mma keep it moving, and keep it real
I'm the second to jump on the track, so I'm in it
Wrote my verse in sixty seconds, did it in six minutes
Ripped it in hours, night and day, and two dozen
Clockwise, time chimes, my mouth keeps running
The days turn to weeks, weeks turn into months
Months become years, years are filled with speed bumps
Slowing you down, obstacles that make you turn around
Just when you reach the top of the hill, you go down
The shelter from the rain, that blocks out the pain
What is the meaning of life? To entertain
What if God was a puppeteer, bringing you near
All close to him, so he can speak in your ear
He's the headlights, and you are the deer
He's the bright in your eyes that causes the fear
The Rodentz (Rodentz) earning that cheddar
Mix it with the cream cheese make it all better
I already have my conscience telling me what to say
My mic is a sword tied to a string like Jubei
Stop and pay like a toll, attention to the scroll
There's 12 of us in a room, and one is a mole
You lose, then you start tripping like Bob Dole
Spread across the globe like butter on a roll

[Chorus]</pre>
