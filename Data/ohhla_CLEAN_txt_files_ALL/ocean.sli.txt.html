Typed by: AZ Lyrics

When you look out on the ocean
And all you see is skies all painted gray
And when you look back on the notion
Yes, you see it's almost went away

And when you're acting like it just ain't right
All you see is almost gonna stay
And when you knowing that it just ain't right
All you see, the night gone turned to day</pre>
