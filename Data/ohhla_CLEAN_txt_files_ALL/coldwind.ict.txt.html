[Intro: Ice-T]
Yo yo yo, please please, please check it out 
Cause I'm a player, I'm always clean
I bought Mercedes Benz when I was seventeen
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame

[Break: Sampler of cold wind blowing]

[Verse One: Ice-T]
The ladies say that I'm heaven sent
Cause I got more money than the US mint
I ride Rag-Top Rolls with rocks on my hand, Maseratis and Mercedes Benz
I have the Uz to line, private Jets, Bel-Air-Boogies place my bets
I own islands up, there close to France
Now I wear designer, chucks and pants 
When I was brought into this world
My mamma never asked if I was boy or a girl
First I rolled over to her, and gave her a kiss 
She said: Your daddy don't rock me like this!
When the doctor hit me on the behind, I broke on down with a funky rhyme 
The nurses said I was awfully cute
When I played out a joint, in a three piece suit
Yo yo yo, please please, please check it out 
Cause I'm a player, I'm always clean
I bought Mercedes Benz when I was seventeen
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I took her by her hand, I said come with me 
We drove up in my vicious eighty three
I took her to diner, I took her to the show
I took her to the suite cause she begged me to go
We got into the room, to make After-Long snaps
So she just shut the seven buckles up and came up with a gat
Stretched through the door, I didn't cut no slack
I had her on the floor, on her stomach, on her back
I had her on the wall, and I hold it on the knee
I put her in the hot tub and the water started to freeze
I took her out the hot tub then I put her on the faucet
"Ooh Ice-T, I can't take no more" 
I put her in the bed then she looked up in the mere
Screaming so loud, I think the East Coast did hear
I floored on my back, I put her on the top
She said: "Ooh Ice-T, would this ever stop?" 
I said No! the freaking has just began
We hit fifty more positions before I got gone
When we've got finished, it was no longer dark
We had rocked so hard, made her snotty farts bark
Then she rolled over to me, she looked me in my eye
And said these words to my surprise: 
She said: I tried to check you, cause I knew I could
I came here with you, cause I thought I should
I tried to freak you, cause I thought I could
But oohh baby, you're sure I could?
She said: baby you're one hell of a man, ain't no better riding than Disney Land
Now to all you ladies that think you're fly, and can out freak the average guy
Don't ever come venturing through my door
I'll have begging to stop, while you're screaming for more
Yo, please check it out
All the ladies in the house come check it out 
Cause I'm a player with juice on every hand
So deeply in packet I control demand
But we all know how I earn my pay
Cause if you don't wanna work, then you got to play

[Break: 69 seconds of Jazz music interlude]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Brothers when you winning in Donna Fox
You don't take her to MC Donalds to jack in the box
Don't pick her up, in a bus or a Cap 
She needs a black belt chauffeur and a cornice wrap
You can take her to dine at the finest spot
Or you take her to a disco that's really hot
You can take her home and while you're all alone
Don't forget to disconnect the phone
You can take her to the bed, you throw back the sheets..</pre>
