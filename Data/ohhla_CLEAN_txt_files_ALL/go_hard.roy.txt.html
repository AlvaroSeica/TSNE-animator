[Swellz]
I don't give a fuck who you go and get
I ain't running or hiding
I done had it I'm clappin the iron
Who you ice grillin' why is you eyeing
It's nothin to me you little niggaz
Can't collide with a giant
You hard headedwith fucks so defiant
Think it's sweet we hold heat
Don't try us my weight up like the kid
Pump iron if I squeeze enemy's better duck
Or dey dyin dats my word
On my seeds yeah
I mean that for my youngins I'll do life in da bing
Scrap and fuck niggaz
I don't got no friends just associates
I keep them a distance that's appropriate
Enter my zone a get you cracked maybe choked a bit
Snap til you motionless best you with a bat til it snap
And I broke the shit if this weak
you want to act then approach
And get clapped when the toaster spit

[Giz]
Go hard or go home is the motto this year
See the game don't wait
Ain't no time for fear
A lot of niggaz gonna hate when they get left in the rear
But scared money don't make money, that's just how I feel
A lot of people be like Giz how you get that deal
It didn't happen over night had to be patient you hear
Well there's a lot of other niggaz with some banging CD's
But they still ain't fucking with Giz let me tell you
A lot of niggaz tring to be like me but it's hard
And every chance I get I pull they card
I ain't gotta try hard to spit game at ya'll niggaz
Keep talking slick I'm a take aim at ya'll niggaz
Ya'll a bust in the air
Scream lets take it to war only got seventeen shots
I got about eighty more
Ten is goin through you the other ten in your home
Twenty is spitting at your crew the rest I save for the law
