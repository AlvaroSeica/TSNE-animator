Get control you sun
They don't owe you, they own you sun
They control you sun
Maybe bones they gon' throw you some
But you get bold and they gone bone you sun
You tryna blow you sun?
That's the reason why you blow you sun?
Try to take back what they stole you sun
Don't join the show you sun
Don't you see they tryna hoe you sun?
That don't make you feel kinda low you sun?
For the dough you sun?
That's the reason why you sold you sun?
Listen here, lemme tell you some'm
All yous suck
Ain't nobody tryna be you sun
Don't nobody even need you sun
Don't nobody even believe you sun
You just in it to deceive you sun
You just in it to receive you sun
You just in it to receive a sum
You ain't nowhere to be seen in the scrum
You belong down in the sea with the scum
You nothing like a emcee you sun
You get no play on Ready Cee you sun
You's a crumb
4C you sun
All luck, door 3 you sun
OD you sun
Pho-ny you sun
Ho-ly mo-ly you sun
That is not for me you sun
I know you's tryna get a deal you sun
And wasn't tryna keep it real you sun
But what's the deal you sun?
You ain't really gotta kneel you sun
Wouldn't you prefer to heal you sun?
We the dominant allele you sun
Where's your vigor and your zeal you sun?
You kick the same old spiel you sun
How dare you sun?
Beware, be aware you sun
I think you oughta say a prayer you sun
Except you tryna be a player you sun
You let em tell you what to wear you sun
They tell you how to wear your hair you sun
That ain't fair you sun
I know you swear you prepared you sun
But it's clear that you scared you sun
I smell your fear you sun
They gon' push you to the rear you sun
They gon' kick you in the rear you sun
They gon' smear you sun
Is that the way that you was reared you sun?
You think that honesty is weird you sun?
Sun where you from?
But let a couple more years pass and where you sun?</pre>
