[Intro]
Yeah
Jesse Abraham's about to make a song
I like making songs
It's fun
Shouts to IllMind on the track
Shouts to New York City on my back
Shouts to the tic and the tac
Keeping me fresh, you know

[Verse 1]
I arrived at private school thinking life was nice and cool
But just like a icicle it was cold there
As a first grader I was reading Voltaire
Teachers so stuck up that I could see their nose hair
When I played basketball kids were screaming, "No fair!"
I played at West 4th; these kids didn't go there
I entered high school like, "This is my school
You can't stop my shine, don't even try to."
"Who exaggerates sometimes?"
OK, I do
"What was the real situation?"
I was 5'2"
I was a guy who liked to write through nights
"When kids were getting high you probably writing haikus."
Ok, you're right, true
I did my own thing
I'd drink a light brew
Underneath the Brooklyn Bridge with my tight crew
Eating subway on the subway's what we called a drive through

[Chorus]
Whatup
Yes my name is Jesse
Whatup
But don't forget that Abraham
Whatup
 And just like Wayne is Gretzky
Whatup
I am what I say I am
Whatup
But sometimes my game is messy
Whatup
When it's time to change the plan
Whatup
I smile and feel no stress, B
Whatup
If ya feel me then raise your hand

[Verse 2]
Illiterate litter on Twitter makes me consider
Quitting the Internet cuz of idiot intellect
I admit it I'm bickering
Yes I'm bitter and snickering
I'm committed to legitimate thinking thicker than cigarettes
Quicker than flickers of light
Lighter than flickering flames
Brighter than fires with liquor dripping on everything
Tripping on every string
Sipping from every drink
Skipping the reverie, I don't dream I make memories think
Yeah I was locked in the Emory clink
I was trembling, every girl was resembling Pink
Conformity wasn't unique
It seemed the norm would be Greek
I was lost in Dawson's Creek
It was better to flee
Yes I runnin cause frosted peaks had exhausted me
So I moved to Boston
It was not so awesome
Now I'm back walkin the streets of NYC and that is where I blossom

[Chorus]
Whatup
Yes my name is Jesse
Whatup
But don't forget that Abraham
Whatup
And just like Wayne is Gretzky
Whatup
I am what I say I am
Whatup
But sometimes my game is messy
Whatup
When it's time to change the plan
Whatup
I smile and feel no stress, B
Whatup
If ya feel me then raise your hand

[Verse 3]
So now I'm lookin at Brooklyn
As I walk across the bridge
Say mazel tov to kids who never talk a lotta shit
Or smoke a lotta cigs or even clock a lotta digits
The apple where I live is big and I'm a midget
I used to talk to pigeons; wait a minute, no I didn't
Well maybe just a smidgen
My religion used to be fibbin
But I was driven to evolve
From a gibbon to a man that had risen to resolve
All my pitiful flaws my individual concepts
Of raucous lawlessness I was involved in
I developed a conscience
Said goodbye to the nonsense
Turned my mind to a rhombus of craziness
Maybe a circle, yes, I am the radius
Making an atheist believe in the radiance
How many verses will I disperse
Til these worthless spurts fulfill their perfect purposes?
No nervousness
I'm a fervent servant
So observe my earthliness
My verb's a kiss
My words are just an adjustment, get the jist?
A jester
Jesse Abraham is just a little kid
As a kid I bit a little bit of shit
But quicker than the flick of a Bic I got rid of the pitiful pits
Now I just spiggidy spiggidy spit

[Chorus]
Whatup
Yes my name is Jesse
Whatup
But don't forget that Abraham
Whatup
 And just like Wayne is Gretzky
Whatup
I am what I say I am
Whatup
But sometimes my game is messy
Whatup
When it's time to change the plan
Whatup
I smile and feel no stress, B
Whatup
If ya feel me then raise your hand</pre>
