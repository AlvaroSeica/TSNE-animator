[Carl Thomas] (Faith Evans)
Uh, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
(Emotional)

I always dreamed that everything would be okay
With me and you, but I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes
I didn't see all the things I used to see
What's going on?

1 - [Faith Evans]
    You gave me reason to believe that
    We were always meant to be
    But now I see, you were wrong
    You can't keep running back to me
    With all those "Baby, baby please"-s
    No more, no more

2 - [Faith &amp; Carl]
    Never imagined
    You would be a painted picture
    I'm emotional
    You saw me leaving
    No deceiving, it's official
    I'm emotional

[Faith]
I can't forget that night I saw you in the corner
Wrapped up tight, you were wrong ooh
Slow dancing on the floor
While I was watching from the door
So hurt, there you were

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

You had your chance
But you through it all away
Thought you had my love always
Oh baby, I don't understand
Why you think that we could in total unhappiness

Repeat 2 till end</pre>
