[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
I figure the configuration on exactly how many steps it'll take me
For I get to the passenger side of the car
Break through the glass, smash the window *sounds of breaking glass*
Put ya hands on the desk, bitch *girl screaming*

[Verse 2: O.C.]
I refill Clyde, stick up ya ride, give it up
Put it in park baby, don't let me spark that ass
Cry, you die, poundin yellin or shoutin or doubtin my itch
No time for thinkin, honey, make the switch
Move over! You're end is near, fear me!

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
I speaks clearly I didn't stutter
I shutter the think of thoughts that would event-u-ally
Shatter the hammer that tips the back of the brown
And shatters the face in blood and stops the heart
That pounds pain sings, why intrutiatin
While I think of how long I was
Eagerly waitin, anticipatin the style

[Verse 4: O.C.]
Causin terror throughout the late night
Seein the flashin of the break light
Those a jaw on the car while she takes flight
I suffice a tight grip
My joints are almost torn from my arm
I must warn

[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch &amp; All]
If you worshippin Range Rovers
YOU WON'T GO FAR
Yo Prince call for doe kid
YOU WON'T GO FAR
Wherever you live, whoever you are
This is some track jacks and
YOU WON'T GO FAR

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
What's this black man for sight of sedan
I keeps my hands twitchin for the ignition to ignite
People I guess my thirty-eight slug (Why!)
Because I love to, then I cut the steering wheel (Howcome?)
To pull the club through (Whoeee)

[Verse 6: Prince Poetry]
Now should I make an intestate, estate my crews (cruise)
Around to take time to make plans
So cop a move it's needed, weed it
But I don't lose for DJ Swan like
Lopez and hopin the pressure don't choke us

[Verse 7: O.C.]
Daddy dearest seem to be the nearest to me
In his infectious Lexus
Splittin in large and I be highly respected
Game time you dissappear you always by my side
Few days later gon re-appear, mom was in fear
Buddha crime don't limits in the celebrity limelight
Funkadelic got jacked from niggaz, callin for fight

[Verse 8: Prince Poetry]
Struggle and fight loss like love foresight nor like
Jet on that Bronx man's wife or that New Jersey turnpipe
(North South West to East)

[Verse 9: O.C.]
Car jacks mush ceased I kidnap to place
He accidentially grabbed my niece, in the backseat
Facts simmily to simmily jack a fifty you provoke
Frontin in infinity I diddity in yours don't mean nothin
Trouble in temple get a clappin down and handcuffin

[Chorus: Prince Poetry &amp; All]
Now f you worshippin legends baby
YOU WON'T GO FAR
Promos and track beats
YOU WON'T GO FAR
Wherever you live, whoever you are
This is some track jacks and
YOU WON'T GO FAR
Whoever you are
YOU WON'T GO FAR
Whoever you are
YOU WON'T GO FAR</pre>
