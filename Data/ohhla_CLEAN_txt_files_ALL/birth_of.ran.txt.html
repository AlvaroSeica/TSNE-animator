[Random]
We the Knights of the Round, fight 'til you down
Let off infinite rounds, a frightening sound
enemy skill, we gettin this gil
Traveled the land protected by an energy shield
Random encounters with lifeforms I never seen
Me and my four part team, materia in my jeans
Aerith's gone and I sorely miss her
A part of me wishes I had gone and died with her
But her people knew the secret and hid it
Kept the black materia where Sephiroth wouldn't get it
My mind's playin tricks, and I'm walkin a thin line
Knowin I could lose control at any time
So travelin close to me isn't advised
I can't be responsible for any more lives
North Crater, better sooner than later
Meet me at the center of the earth and say a prayer
Yeah-yah

[Chorus]
Sometimes you gotta pick sides
Life is a game and the goal is survive
The future of all mankind is the prize
And the end result is the birth of a God

[Pennywise]
Ay yo it's time to leave Midgar and go meet the team
AVALANCHE in full effect call me Mr. Valentine
Fast trigger when I'm bustin, never had to use a summon
So I'm comin for you Hojo, you better start runnin
Yo I'm down for cause, keep it movin never stall
If united we are standin then divided we fall
The Gold Saucer was a trap, snuck out the back
I fell a hundred feet to the ground guns still in tact
I need a airship cause I can't pass through the mountains
Call the only city, have to deal with all the shoutin
Lookin for the Ancient City checkin through the map
Sephiroth on our path, so there's no turning back
Genetically enhanced so I think I gotta chance
New spell level up strong weapon in my hand
Shinra must collapse if we wanna survive
A daily dose of hi-potion it keeps me alive, yeah

[Chorus]

[Devastate]
See my thoughts drift, walk swift, see this path is designed
to take, passionate strides with the planet in mind
the trail's vast, sail fast, Nail-bat at my side
So I can, battle these tribes of assassins andspies
For each glance at the sky there's a woe to tell
or a SOLDIER dwells to make sure you hope is quelled
Four are compelled - to crush the hateful cowards
who take power from mako showers and Jenova cells
Cause you see Harmony is the mission at hand
to, reap what you can and be at peace with the land
A pipe dream it might seem, but a reason to stand
to fight greed of Shinra and preserve the Lifestream
And each, breath that I take is for our legacy's sake
Each stride is filled with Pride when your end is at stake
so we'll strengthen our chase to an excellent pace
To get the boss Sephiroth before the Weapons awake

[Chorus]</pre>
