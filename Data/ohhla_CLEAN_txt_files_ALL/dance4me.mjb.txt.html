I come up in the dance with a slip of {?}
Butter peanuts, {?} or envy
A family affair, everything is carefree
I ain't get up off the wall until I heard Mary

If you dope and real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me
If you feelin the groove
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me
And I know you been stressed
This whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor
And just dance for me
Just be here ain't no joke
So stay here till we're closed
Stay up on the floor
Just dance for me

Haven't always been rough
But I'm tryna make it easy
For everybody to dance for me
So come one come all come everybody
Me and you all of us bout to really party
And you know that we're gonna put it down
At the tip more drinks we be feelin the sound

If you dope and real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me (come dance with me)
If you feelin the groove
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me

Get off the wall
Cos I know that you can feel me
So stop the frontin'
And dance for me
So come one come all come everybody
Me and you all of us bout to really party
And you know that we're gonna put it down
At the floor more drinks and we're fallin down

If you flowin real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me
And I know you been stressed
This whole week got you messed up
Stay up on the floor
And just dance for me

Leave all your struggles and your cares behind
Don't you worry bout a thing not tonight
Don't drink too much
Because we have all night
Don't you rush because it's all night long

If you dope and real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me (dance for me)
If you feelin the groove
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me (ohh dance for me)
And I know you been stressed
This whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor
And just dance for me
Just be here ain't no joke (dance for me)
So stay here till we're closed
Stay up on the floor
Just dance for me (ohh)

While ladies shake they thangs
Brothers change swang
Dancing is a ritual we used to maintain
Whether steppin the crip walkin
Over music shit talkin
Hard times can soften
In spots we hit often
I feel the love
A basement or a strip club
Good times good wine
Gotta skip the trick dubs
It's up to you
I ain't gon' tell you where your hands to be
Like the ghost of Marvin
Come on and dance for me

If you flowin real hot
And you feelin the vibe
Won't you get on the floor
And just dance for me
If you feelin the groove
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me
And I know you been stressed (dance for me)
This whole week got you messed up (dance for me)
Get on the floor (dance for me)
And just dance for me (dance for me)
Just be here ain't no joke (dance for me)
So stay here till we're closed
And stay up on the floor
And just dance for me

If you dope and real hot (come on, come on)
And you feelin the vibe (come on, come on)
Won't you get on the floor (come on, come on)
And just dance for me (come on, come on)
If you feelin the groove (come on, come on)
It ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor
And just dance for me
And I know you been stressed
This whole week got you messed up</pre>
