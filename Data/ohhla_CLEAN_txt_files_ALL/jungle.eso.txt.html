Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If my head is a jungle, I sow the seeds of
positive thought to grow the trees into
fruitful groceries for my heart and my mind and my soul to feed
Kill the doubt, smoke the weeds
then it's full steam ahead on the open seas
A place where I think and see lateral
the free radical, dreams magical

Sittin on my canopy, with a sunset stain mine that burns bright burgandy
The universe is in all of us, the spark in the dark that can surge my circuitry
Brainstorm and out breaks a whirlwind. I'm surgin, the soundscape is Merlin
Feel life in the blood, sit back and buzz. Live, laugh, and love

You're head is a jungle, jungle [x3]

My head's a jungle with a view of earth
and I didn't really know what to do at first
Every thought is a seed so I used the dirt
and let it grow til it opened a universe
Now I bring to life, whatever I imagine
Eyes open, you're headin for a labyrinth
Fields of flowers, trees to the heavens
and to win the war we won't need any weapons

Free in thought, cosmic bliss
the speed of life through the forest mist
Airborn, no stoppin the dream
when my tummy's gettin tickled by the top of the trees
It's a breath of life, and a burning rose
that's where I start my journey and return to home
Your imagination is a head trip
so enjoy the ride, it's the best whip

You're head is a jungle, jungle [x3]

You're head is a jungle, jungle [x3]</pre>
