[Intro/Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
You remind me of my Beamer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive, I'm tryin to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on your meter
You remind me of my Beamer
See yo' ignition, baby girl I'm tryin to key up
And your head lights are off, I'm tryin to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on your meter
So let me start it up - and smash you

[Tyler, the Creator] + (Frank Ocean)
Pop some tame Impala, your man got a lame impala (and it's dark outside)
And I'm sharing slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow (oooooooh)
You're fuckin nuts; green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through 'em as you wax and buff my muffler up
Cause I fingered you, you think the fuckin ring is comin up? (oooooooh)
Maybe, I don't know, I think you're chill (ride for)
Ridin on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Mmmm, it'll get dark outside soon (ride for it)
Where the streetlights sing (ride for it)
You ain't gotta lie it to kick it
Darling it's cool we're movin slow

[Tyler, the Creator]
You remind me of my Beamer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive, I'm tryin to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on your meter
You remind me of my Beamer - smashing
You remind me of my Beamer

[Outro]
  Where you been man?
Uh I had a drop off to make real quick
Hey have you seen Salem?
  Oh she with that new dude, Wolf or
  Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga man
Ay you know where they went?
  I seen 'em goin down by the lake
What the fuck!
  You good man? You need some sherm? I got some
  I got a can of these baked beans too</pre>
