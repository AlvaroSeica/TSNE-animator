Some of this high...music

[Verse 1]
Fire up the vega, and listen to this playa gangsta
I been in this game for one year, but man I'm on my way to the tip
Flipped the script along time ago when I was young
Eleven years old and learned how to flip the tongue and had them sprung
Tried to tell them foos the last time
They shouldn't have let young gangsta get up on the mic up in the past time
I was taught to hit it, and make it last
Playa from the past, and had the ladies on the dance floor shakin that ass
Reminiscin on '91, beatin on the walls of juvenile hall
Pushin my button til' this bitch broke and ask her to make a head call
They rushed a brotha and he took a fall
I seen my homie and he tell a nigga stand tall
I seen my brother in the gym and I give him dap
Then bust a few freestyle's to let him know I rap
I said when I get out of this A-Y Six I'm finna be makin music
Pick up a mic and show these suckas how to use it
Let's hit the highway

[Chorus 2X]
One day I was headed for the highway
Gettin high as a bird, high as a bird
One day I was headed for the highway
Gettin high as a bird, I think it was a Friday

[Verse 2]
Kickin back, unexplainable to the eye
Chillin off in the cuts, makin everybody think that I'm shy
But I'm a true to life, laid back gangsta draw the line
Respect for every young black man, cuz us black men been through hard times
My hard rhymes create a bond
Within the strange environment
I be livin in, tryin to get the dividends
Keepin it real, at the same time gotta keep my name up
Absorb it like a life size sponge
Gotta keep my game up, came up
From a long way
Cuz back in the days, they used to say, you aint gone never come up and
make it big Gangsta Dre
That's what they thought
That's what they talked
But when this raw uncut game hit the streets
I'm knowin that's what they thought
man it's a, cold world up on these streets of mine
If these youngsters aint out jackin, they made out on the grind
Cloud 1-9 is my state of mind
Stick to the code or comense to pay your fine
Let's hit the highway

[Chorus 2X]

Think it was a Friday
Gettin high as a bird, think it was a Friday</pre>
