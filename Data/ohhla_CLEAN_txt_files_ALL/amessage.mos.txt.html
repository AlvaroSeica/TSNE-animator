Typed by: almost_chinese@hotmail.com

[Mos Def]
Yes A, B is for
My ability
C, D, E-F-F-E-C-T
And the G H is how
It should be
Represent with J-Rocc and Babu
Soundbombing sequel
Meanin in part one and two
Making it funky for you
Boulevard Avenue
Whether you passing through
Or staying for a while
This is the style thats
Universal Magnetic
Mos' bet it
Hold you back like bad credit
Rewind one time and make it fine</pre>
