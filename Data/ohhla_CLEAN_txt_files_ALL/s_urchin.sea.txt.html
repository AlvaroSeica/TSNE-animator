[Intro]
You're disgusting and you're a, urchin

[Sean Strange]
For everybody who thinkin that I don't rep mine, it's bedtime
You're tryin to avoid me like a deadline
I put in work for hip-hop, you callin me fake?
Behind a keyboard, you really made an awful mistake
And joined the homo club, I don't show no love
I leave you layin in the garbage like your promo dub
Shove my dick into your mom mouth, she really likin it
Pipin it, gave me deep throat for a Vicodin
Knife in the back, how many people the real?
I'm dead filthy, the type to put my feet in your grill
SHUT THE FUCK UP~! I perfectly punish your clique in no time
with dope rhymes, you get no shine, but I'm a gold mine
Now eat a dick!! I heard your album and it wreak of shit
Plead the fifth on the altar wreck it like a needle tip
Been evil kid, incredible, Lou Ferrigno
I break into your crib and jump through the window

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
The street urchin - no money and no crib
The street urchin - all bummy and broke kid
The street urchin - I live forever in pain
Ahead of the game, it's Sean Strange remember the name

[Sean Strange]
Aiyyo my team up to no good, we mangle your head
And when I shoot from any angle you're dead
Hybrid author of direct torture (word) I offer infection
Drama with me, you got beef through all my connections
I don't give a fuck, like a prude Catholic bitch
My new hatchet rip through your jacket quick
You wanna hate? Go ahead, I don't care what you think
I'ma forever be grimy like the hair in your sink
Tearin your mink, you wearin pink, faggot you mad gay
I'm havin a bad day can show you the pathway
to the funeral home, then I'm shootin the chrome
It put a hole, in your beautiful dome
I got a cocky attitude, laugh at you when you on stage
You whack and mandible, you talkin funny like Kanye
It's Sean Strange, and there ain't a clean version
Keep burpin fall victim to a rugged street urchin

[Chorus]

"The street urchin..." {*8X*}
Remember the name</pre>
