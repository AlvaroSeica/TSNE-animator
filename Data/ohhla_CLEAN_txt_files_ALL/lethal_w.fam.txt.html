Song:   Lethal Weapon
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: sample]
Beneath the weapon, fuel injected, oh if, it be this lethal
Coming with my people, come-coming with my people

[Crunch Lo]
Flame the mic, it's essential, through some flavor
Tapped all up in your mental, back to ya essence
Is where I send you, before you dare to intervene
This big boy, hold his weight like triple beams
Masked schemes, fill my mind, beware, the pioneer
Engineer, design and architechtist,wrecked this
Simply on some next shit, make a brother 'spect it
Before it get hectic, in your area, hysteria
I creep on you, sleep on me, silently touchdown, cut down, touch ground
Tom-Tom warrior sound, wanna play around
Like Chuck, I bust like shots, Goodfella like Rock
Speedball, defeat all, trynna test this
Bless with, this freshness, my click came to test this
Master M.C., double-breasted, vested
Majestic, flow is collected
Through years of rap, intellections ejected
Grew up, with this profession, in my section
Since the summer, of '74, I've been brawl
Now I got three to make four, blowing the hinges off his God damn door

[Chorus 4X]

[Molly-Q]
I'm the Michelin mad man, that's running for the gram stand
Safe with no worries, before the squad began
Baton hanging twisted, time bomb to blow your fleet out
The water off your feet, now you headed up the creek
Without a paddle, rat off the snake, lost the rattle
Skedaddle, skipped out town on war-eyed saddles
Locked the city sheriff, deputies in jeopardy
Monopoly, our legacy's, the murderous pedigrees
This rap hand, and hold the fucking dimes by the dozen
Tommy gun, smoking palets, we keep it coming
Farmer school leagues, entrees, stampede
Fake better wrong way, to bleed in T.H.C.
A rover over rangers, leaving strangers in danger
I bake in anger, cuz they locked down in Cedar Wrangler
The tight associates, bear hugs and misfits
Mister middle movements, with pistol grips on tits
And brung out the drop, son, it's on in slums
Yo, shimmity Sam bums, drop the guns
It's raining cats in morgues, more gats than porns
From the crack of dawn, the green thumb's in your lawn

[Chorus 2X]

[Shawn Wigs]
Oh yo, what up thug, it's me, the one who put the detonating
Dart in your mic, spiked the Crystal with Sprite
Fuck an image, we curse for this rap, it's mad illege
Raw rhymes spillage, that you can't soak up
With a mop head, dead head porters environment
A twister, rocked off cue's, instrumentals
See Wigga, shine like stainless steel polish
Abolish, four-man team, we demolish
Destruct, make big buck, like politicians
Division, cash it down, like demolitions
Ramsack spit, hollow tip clips through ya pancake vest
Buttermilk, like IHOP, International
Got mad thoughts, it's all actual
All natural, the thug looking just casual
Massive thoughts, massive material
Sophisticated move, mind state imperial

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
