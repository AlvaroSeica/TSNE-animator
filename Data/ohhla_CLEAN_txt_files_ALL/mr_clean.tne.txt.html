[Intro]
Ridin wit me
AYY~! Now ridin wit me
AYY~! Now ridin wit me
AYY~! Already..
Ay this joint right here mayne (ay)
We gon' lay back for dis one, but still keep it in the club
Hey, ohh, this record go by the name of Mr. Clean
You understand - brand new, let's go

[Tone Tone]
You might see me on the block in a Jag drop top
With the rims on the car that keep goin when I stop
I'm so fresh on the scene, they call me Mr. Clean
And when I'm comin down the block they say the car be lookin mean
And I'm doin the gangster lean as I'm lookin out the mirror
Some diamonds in my ear is close to cost a bank roll
And you know I'm gettin money mayne it ain't that hard to tell
With a pocket full of money so it ain't that hard to smell
And I got they mouth droppin e'ry time I slide through
Got the Range Rover wearin like the Suge Knight sue
I bought my first pair of Cartiers back in high school
I done stepped it up a notch, went and got the ice blues
And when it's time to hit the club, I'm makin sure I'm head to toe
Drankin on some Rosey Mo, when I'm walkin through the do'
And you can tell I'm from the hood because I'm over 20 deep
And I keep it brand new when you see me through the streets

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm in the brand new car, on some brand new shoes
Some brand new clothes, let me show you how I do
How I do - yep I keep it Mr. Clean
Mr. Clean - yep I keep it Mr. Clean

[Tone Tone]
I ball all the time mayne I gots to hit the mall
Not just one or two bags mayne I gots to buy it all
If you feelin like I am mayne then go on 'head and stunt
Buy the bar until they out and drink it 'til ya get drunk
Make them haters gettin mad and make them broads get loose
Have 'em sippin on some Goose, now they ridin in my Coupe
And the Coupe is apple green with the suicide do's
Set the shoulder wheel bump stuntin I gotta ride slow
Diamonds in my name with the diamonds in my chain
Got the marbles on my face with some diamonds in my frames
And I know a lot of dealers that be servin on the block
They ain't worried 'bout no fed time, they payin off the cops
And they say I'm really rich because I made a quarter mill
And I did all that pimpin way before the deal
And you can tell I'm from the hood because I'm over 20 deep
And I keep it brand new when you see me through the streets

[Chorus]</pre>
