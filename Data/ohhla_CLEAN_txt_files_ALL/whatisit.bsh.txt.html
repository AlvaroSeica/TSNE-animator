[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
I'm a holler back, then I pop my collar back
Girl, I see that
Da-da-da, dunk
I want all of that, follow that
Train man, follow that caboosey
Ain't nathin' in the world
Like some thick, and some juicy
She going downtown, cause her favorite DJ's spinnin'
I'm all up in the door, so I'm already winnin'
I got a lot of women, but I'm way too choosey
And then I love my cake, like that Ricky love Lucy
On some peanut butter leather, with the wood so grainy
It must be raining dollars, cause she lookin' so gravy
Sophisticasted lady, pop it to the end, what it do
What the busi', baby girl, tell me what's happenin', what's happenin'

Repeat Chorus Twice

Pre-Verse: Baby Bash
She move like she dancing on YouTube
The kind of chica that you really ain't used to
Dame lo, dame lo, mami, shoot through
In my ear, talkin' 'bout, I'm a do you

(Verse 2)
Everyone top-notch it
Everybody watch it
Ain't no punk, when she pop, lock and drop it
Straight show stop it
Watching me perform
Got the Cyclone ringtone on the phone
I feel it on my body, baby, girl, I'm in the zone
Must be the goose mixed with a little 'Tron
She make it happen, Cap'n, feeling on me
We in the billin' and we feeling like wee

Repeat Chorus Twice
