I was born son of Cameron brother of Brendon
Been through so much shit I don't know how I'm still standin
I come from a place that's cold and dark
Where brothers gotta dodge bullets just to make their mark
Yo I grew up in the eighties around domestic violence
But my family was proud so we kept it silent
The ladies in my fam held it all together
And I was introduced to rap despite the stormy weather
I remember listenin to Kool Moe Dee
I kicked his verses like that shit straight belonged to me
I used to loungin in my room bumpin Raising Hell
Wishing I could be like KRS-One or LL
All the honeys gassed me up and made my ego swell
Cause I was doin it, and doin it, and doin it well
I was only sixteen terrorising the stage
They used to call me Stud B cause I was big for my age
I was rhymin bout my skills and my sexual clout
When I barely even knew what I was talkin about
Straight tellin all my peoples when my album was droppin
Every time the day came there was nuttin to be coppin
But still I rock show after show and never stop
It was obvious that my career will be in hip-hop
And the reason that I'm here holdin down the fort
Is cause my people always gave their never ending support


The time is now, the place is here
Hip-hop's making a turn for the better this year
The place is here, the time is now
Akrobatik finally made it to ya'll some how


One day when I was seventeen I seen this honey round my way
The way her hips and her ass look bright in my day
My main objective then was to get her butt naked
I wrote a song about it, put it on my first record
Woman, back with Ruff Enuff and The Fat Shit
These joints put me on the underground mad quick
I only wish that grandma was there to see it
I'm the man now and she always told me I would be it
Now I'm goin outta town wreckin facilities
Blowin up with Lif on Inhuman Capabilities
Tryin to show these suckas just what lyrical perfection is
So we formed the powerful crew called The Perceptionists
Got the whole world steady waitin on the album
Now in 2003 you'll see the outcome
You know by now that I'm here to make a difference
Here's a sneak pick at the life of Jared Bridgeman
I'm givin shouts to those who showed love
Almost drownin theirself just to keep my head above
That's why to ya'll I'm forever in day
You all know who you are and I'll never forget it


The time is now, the place is here
Hip-hop's making a turn for the better this year
The place is here, the time is now
Akrobatik finally made it to ya'll some how

Yeah, the time is now, the place is here
Hip-hop's taking a turn for the better this year
Yo, the place is here, the time is now
Akrobatik finally made it to ya'll some how</pre>
