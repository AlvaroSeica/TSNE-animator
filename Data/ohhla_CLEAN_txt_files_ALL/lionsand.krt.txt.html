[Chorus: 2X]
OK, so time never waits for no man, peep the slow hand
Lions is all we really, no lambs
Get money, split it up with my broham
When you go outside don't let the do' slam
Don't let the do' slam
Don't let the do' slam
Don't let the do' slam
When you go outside (keep quiet)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Your, your gracious Lord, I say a prayer for all of mine
searching for a fixing in these broken times
I let my anger feed my hunger pain
Plotting with my brother from another mother about running thangs
Another round table mission
cause rap ain't paying off and ain't no food in the kitchen
So I'ma get these Ps with the L with the smell
that make them smokers go crazy, can you feel me like braille?
Politicking bout a move or two
so we can put on for the city like they used to do
And all them hoes that didn't call me boo
will break they backs when they see that boy, I'm cruising through
Cause they respect it when you're clocking major figures
Throwing turkeys with the stuffing off of eighteen-wheelers
Watching for the laws with the judges on call
Shuck and jiving to get by with this pistol in my drawers

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Now who that peeking in my window?
Music on crescendo, vibing to the sounds of the endo
Playing King Kong, no Nintendo
I can't trust a soul, niggas giving up their kinfolk
Grandmommas, mommas and baby mothers
grandfathers, fathers and baby brothers
get scared, find themselves undercover
You knew the consequences of pushing them junkies' hubbas
I tell the story how it be
Don't bring no dirt in mine, don't speak on what you see
Always call before you come, you get jammed, you don't know me
Leave that wire at the do', wash your hands before you eat
Don't play the game if it ain't keeps
Be ready for the finals, better practice what you preach
You ain't the stand up type? Then find a seat
You blood is thicker than water, but both them thangs leak

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Them tattletales tell the tales of cars and clothes
of players that pose for cameras and shine for hoes
Gleam and glow under strobes of lights in the club
with drinks that's dirty and shots that's dubbed
And people give kisses and hugs to niggas with plugs
minus the sink, not talking bout tubs, talking bout bass
You thinking bout submarine maybe, now where the holes in yo' boat?
The people that tell be people you know
The people that hurt be people you owe, time
Now daddy ain't around to hold them down now
for the Benz with broads and rims
Instead of breaking even with odds and ends, you doing five to ten
on the late night, for swimming in pools with Great Whites
They smell that dirty money, no last train to London
or Paris, life is more than carats and fur coats
On the low, that tick tock is worth mo'

[Chorus]</pre>
