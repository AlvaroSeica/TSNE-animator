[Intro: 60 Second Assassin]
Chill, man, chill, g!
See you don't know what's going on, man
I see right now, you don't know what's happening
There it go, there it go

[Chorus 2X: 60 Second Assassin]
Our common enemy, commonly known, check the rules
(What - type - of man)
The only difference between them, is me and you
(Tell - the - truth)
It be the tricks the devil pull, you don't exist
(This - is - scam)
So don't expect no help from them, Godz People
(No - one's - do)

[Interlude: 60 Second Assassin]
A black man's vote means nothing today
By any and all means necessery
They done turned it around on us
And left us poor folks behind
And want us to swallow up the legislature
And your paper, where I don't think that the truth
Can satisfy the human race
I said it before and I'll say it again
The Devil has scored a point on God's court
It's at the top of the 9th inning
And our people must step up to home plate
I need a team, I need a team
To move with one mind
I need a team, to move with one body
One soul, I need a team, I need a team

[Armel]
What else can be said? I'm first to admit
My people's fucking hard head, and soon to be dead
I brings to my eyes to see a young black man die
And don't know why (It's a shame)
Who's to blame, the player or the game?
If things don't change (we all lose)
You can lead the horse to water, but you can't make him drink
So why you actin' like (shit don't stink)

[Sharecka]
Ain't no comparison' to what we do
Weed, enough bread and from the struggle, scuff bumps
And rumbles, poverty and hunger
Sodomy, child abuse, if adults don't teach the youth
Then what's the use? This ain't got
Nothing to do with sales, it's the truth
And the message from me to you, hoping it'll see you through
They should build and be the rule, and droppin' jewels a must
Ain't no justice, it's 'just us'
Government fuckin' business up
Yeah, y'all fed up, get a dick to suck
If my niggaz fall down, I'mma pick 'em up
First move, foundation, what?

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yeah, I keeps it straight up 12 O'Clock, since back in the days
Macks and trades, and roam away from the PJ such
Where it take checks, no tolerance for disrespect
Face mask, noodies woodies, berettas and techs
Young cats up in the discotecque, chin check vets
Triple threat, through the system they fret
Through Knowledge, Wisdom, overstand, collect
Mad respect to my fams, all my mans, all the world that I met
Now I'm a grown man, movin' with the plans of a winner
Fightin' with the snakes, realest tenors
Killin' for the thriller with thinner
Brick face, on the hunt for dinner
We set it on, contenders pretenders
Beginners trynna stop the agenda
Heavy hitters on the grind, like Brenda's
Go hard to the grain, baby, never surrender
Play the scene like black marbles
Never will I follow a man, due to my self
Rather train, bus, dollar van (what type of man)

[Chorus to end]</pre>
