Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Jet life, that's all playa
Fresh weed in a glass jar playa
Not the body, vampire slaya
Pull her string like a guitar playa, John Mayor
Body shakin, body snatcher,
Undertaker, come pick the track up cause this was a massacre
Spitta den beat the beat
Right side, left and then rerap it backwards
Holy maccaral, I'm low in a Malibu two door listenin to Disney Rascal
Right up ya avenue, fly as a parachute,
High as a paratrooper, before he deploy
You ain't a d-boy you a fuckin decoy
You ain't Bruce Lee nor Bruce Leroy
Can't kick bruce bruce, you a comedy boy YEAH
My mission here is to destroy the wackness
Or in all fashions from all fashions
Fools they are. pay for they sucker-ish actions
Cast out nigga the casino magic [?]
My girl from cincinnati
My weed from Cali
Feel the blitz, like a o-line, wats happenin
High Time
Evergreen pine, we snappin trees in half and use the snap to make hash with
Hede de hede [?]
My paper straight, holdin it down, I'm a paper weight
Knock off baller yo paper fake
You fallin off and I'm home plate safe
How else can I call it but how I see it?
Can't say ya name cause I ain't see ya
Flow cold, inside door of the freezer
Four hoes chose but I'm in a two seater
Follow in a cab or I'll catch ya next weekend
Either way baby girl, nigga ain't tweekin
Pleadin, please
I'm peelin off, now you realized you was dealin with a boss
Coulda took a ride but you took a loss
Got yo friend in my drop with the top takin off
At the crib her top get takin off
And she can share the details when she wake tomorrow
YEAH</pre>
