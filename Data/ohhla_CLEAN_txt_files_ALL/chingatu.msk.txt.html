Yeah that's right... Ms. Krazie
Reyes Urbanos
Para cualquier puto
Hijo de la chingada
Ya sabes quien eres;
Y esta es educada

[Verse 1]
I once thought I loved you, can't believe that I did
Then you left went away so I did what I did
I can't believe it when they told me
That they seen you with somebody whose the bitch
Let me at her, so you called up everybody
And you told them what to say cause I asked you for an alibi
What you think I'm stupid fool?!
I'm not the one that's on your mind
Now look at me, why the fuck you tryna hide
I ain't about to Waste my time on the worthless homicide
I'm a put you to the side and forget about it all
But before you go away let me tell you what I saw
So you look over your shoulder everytime your in town
And Your out with that hoe and your girls I've seen around
Catch you on the rebound I've seen you walking with her
Now I don't know why you changed me for her
That's a blur, ugly ass piece of shit of a rat
Your dealing with but fuck it, I don't care I'm not the one who's hitting it

[Chorus]
Now I don't give a fuck about you and if I ever did vale verga
My reaction I went through hell and back with chu seperated
From reality pues
I don't know I can't remember what the fuck I saw en ti
Now I don't give a fuck about you and if I ever did vale
Verga my reaction I went through hell and back with you
Seperated from reality but now I'm gone
Chinga tu madre guey no creo en ti

[Verse 2]
Now your happy with her that's for a limited time
Then my phone rings up and it's you on the line telling me
Que te perdone para ver me tricionado
Que me quieres y me extranas y que mucho me hace llorado
Guarda de tus pinches cuentos
I don't believe you and maybe this time I'll be the one to
Decieve you fucken perro desgraciado
Vete mucho a la chingada y gracias a ti ahora soy una malandra
Watch me picking up vatos y dropping them al suelo
Volviendo los adictos a tiener y al cemento
Arancando con sus vidas como tu con la mia yo que tanto te Queria y tu que no me merecillas
But fuck it ya lo echo ya esta echo and as I'm playing vatos stab 'em straight en the pecho
That's right you heard it straight from the mistress of latina rap and I'm a always treat you bad like that
You fucken bitch ese!

[Chorus]
Now I don't give a fuck about you and if I ever did vale verga
My reaction I went through hell and back with you
Seperated from reality pues
I don't know I can't remember what the fuck I saw en ti
Now I don't give a fuck about you and if I ever did vale verga
My reaction I went through hell and back with chu
Seperated from reality but now I'm gone
Chinga tu madre guey no creo en ti

[Verse 3]
Ya no lloro por ti algun dia me di cuenta que con lagrimas
De sangre acavava casi muerta ya mis manos mal tratadas llenas de sicatrices alli fui una
Estupida al ver como me fije ya vendra ese dia en que llegue ese amor, un vato firme peloncito
Que no me cause dolor tengo un vato loco
Que conmigo se covike el que este aqui conmigo
Cuando yo lo nececite, cruisin it on a Sunday afternoon with him
Until death do us apart I'm a be with him
Ain't no time wasted, in between the sheets
Packing clips in between my tits to close his lips
But until that day comes, I'm a always be a rider
And still down for that clear white fog to take me higher
Ya te dije, my love was never your fuckken toy
So if you have something to say, close your mouth homeboy!

[Chorus]
Now I don't give a fuck about you and if I ever did vale verga
My reaction I went through hell and back with you
Seperated from reality pues
I don't know I can't remember what the fuck I saw en ti
Now I don't give a fuck about you and if I ever did vale verga
My reaction I went through hell and back with chu
Seperated from reality but now I'm gone
Chinga tu madre guey no creo en ti</pre>
