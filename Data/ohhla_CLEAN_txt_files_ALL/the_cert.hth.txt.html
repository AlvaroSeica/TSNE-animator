[Suffa]
Certified Wise in the house tonight 
[Flak: Certified Wise!]
[Suffa]
Oi, when I say 'Certified' you say Wise
We say 'Certified' - - WISE!
'Certified' - - WISE!

[Verse 1: Suffa]
The Certified have arrived, extraordinaire extravagant
Beers like confidence, man I'm drinkin' until I'm arrogant
Cause I'm a cocky fuck, Hit your girl and I knock her up
You're like "what the fuck?", in the net like a hockey puck (score!)
Rappers get embarrassed when they see the way that we work
They try hard, they shamed like fat guys swimming in T-shirts
Research your Oz hip-hop, before you step to us
And if you step, hands around your throat like a necklace

[Verse 2: Trials]
Mr Trials, young ladies gimme a call
My number's written next to "Fuckwit" on the chicks bathroom wall
I'm slightly easy and a tripe bit sleazy
With a wit of a red brick and chiselled body of Kim Beazley
My theory is, never touch the mic quite serious
A kid goes out on dates later than their next period
My crews got it made, rockin the place
With more dope rappers to match every pram chillin at Colonnade's

[Verse 3: Kris]
It's Certified Wise, no need to tell you again
Because these cunts can be so funky that the smell would offend
A dyke's girlfriend dog, now lets get straight to the point shall we
This rowdy crowd of MC's and DJ's know how to pound beats
Like kids with flat feet and crap beats walking down backstreets
So much work went into this the liner notes are fact sheets
Like black sheep I've got two words for those who slept
"nya, Nya nya nyoooo respect!"

[Verse 4: Mic Lez]
You thought it was safe, well guess what (what?)
Boys then beware; my friends will find your weak points (then what)
Get up in there
Attack your mind, with a fine rhyme when I find time
And I'll find out if you're walking if you're talking the grape vine
I'll waste time. Need to take on the job at hand
The skills for this professional typical certified wise man
From sky to land, I'm overcoming all your schemes and plans
So take cover as I rain thunder upon you man

{Hook}
I manifest Hip-Hop in it's highest degree... "Certified Wise"
Hip-Hop's somethin' I take very seriously... "I sensualise"... "Certified Wise" 

[Verse 5: Headlock]
Every songs a collection of kids chart lives
Like the porn section of Gary Glitters hard drive
Certified Rights throws agendas so hot 
it'd make a married man give up his annual blowjob
You better show something, with heading no bluffin
On the wrong side of my tracks, I'll smash your pettycoat junction
In a suffering city, I'm punishing the pretty
And if you don't fucking kill me I'll crush you without pitty

[Verse 6: Blockade]
I arrange certain words amongst silence
To be heard in abundance while MC's face redundance
Stero speakers exceed beyond specifications
to extended noise generations
Let's cut the conversations to a small chat
(Why's that?) I'm busy trying to react to the hi-hats
Blockade and Certified stand tall and pop ridiculous under-achievers
and constant non-believes (believes)

[Verse 7: Sesta]
I'm on stage with a handful of Panadol's handing them out
cos of the head throbbing from the head nodding
And we about putting you out for the count like Mike, check
You ain't gonna get certified respect
So hide your decks, your mics I might blackout
In a cypher when I still take the title
The name's Sesta, I snatch an 'L' plate
And slap it on your forehead with more force than porn sex

[Verse 8: Debris]
It's the Buddhist Monks with the certified MC's
I'll make you nod your head like Parkinson's disease
So stand at ease, but don't step to our click
I got a hundred metronomes just waiting to go sick 
So take your pick, but not the axe or the shovel
*After Hours* I'll make beds rock like Barney Rubble
It's kinda subtle the way that my flow bores
And leave your ears up shit creek without a Funkoar

[Verse 9: Flak]
Now certified wise gotta hold o ya
We drop a whole lot o crop of magnolia
We're the fresh B-boys in Nike and Adidas
We're hotter than heaters and blowin up speakers
There's no half-steppers, we far from a fake, we make
Rap music every Aussie can relate to
We'll never take a tumble, We're not gonna stumble
If you dis any member the result is "LET'S RUMBLE"

{Hook} [Scratches by DJ Debris]
"Let me show you new rappers how to do a posse reckin"
[scratches]
"Let me show you new rappers how to do a posse reckin"
[scratches]
"Let me show you new rappers how to do a poss poss posse re reckin"

[Verse 10: Simplex]
Complex compliments this simple, to complete this individual
Simplex the original beat, the hypocritical 
Ridicule, the weaker techniques that leave you burnt
Like cannabis, that either you do or you dont, we'll prove that you wont
Ever endeavour to get it together to better these fellas
I'll be like whatever, you get it?
You're wondering why you should never try
The reason Certified is Mr Nice with the wise guys

[Verse 11: Expressionist]
We leave crews stressfully, on a quest to be
recognised, put up on a level next to me
And the Wise unified our lives, we bless the beat
We yet to see competitors who can compete with
elaborate schemes they conjoured up in their dreams
Have to be outta your mind to even battle this team
Masterminds of the game, nobody does it the same
When we leave the stage we're sure that you remember the name

[Verse 12: Kolaps]
You faggot MC's always compare one another
Studio 2000's where you shot your album cover
I've the right patience, to your shit dictation
Then commence domestic MC word castration
Like excelles effects from a psychadelic wanger
For you there's no escape like sperm in a franger
Simulated immitations fade away progressively
So go fuck yourself homaphrodite MC

{Hook}
"Yo this is DJ Debris"
"Representing"
"Certified Wise"

[Verse 13: Trauma]
Authoritarian, pages down, lyrical librarian
My strong line is carnivore, your line was vegetarian
Comparin them, I'm tearin them in two so don't you dare me then 
comparin them with them, I'm bringing heat like a solarium
You're starin then, you better step back while I'm preparin them
certified lyrical delegates are all the soundions 
Rebellions under one banner for new milleniums 
The south is certified, it's so good like Sanitarium

[Verse 14: Intalekt]
I throw tamflows, handflows who scare those who dare oppose
But don't compare the pro's, I'm dressed in thread-band clothes 
Still these rare flows got MC's pleading ("Give us a fair go!")
Try to stop me, you don't realise the lengths to which I'm prepared to go
We should take a short journey and leave you at your wits-end
You get burnt like you're smoking a cigarette from the lit end
You're acting so femineity, could be stressing about split-ends
Certified hit home with so much force they make bricks bend

[Verse 15: Hons]
The situation gets sticky like a perve with porn mags 
My presence on stage will make your trailor hoarse gag 
Staunch cat, Hornbag, You know my style sucker
And that we make tracks to get you up like a fluffer
Certified wise, notorious to rip cunts
Dissin us will get costly like private shows at strip clubs
Beating me's a hard task by itself so fuck you
cos that's a fantasy like anal sex with Eliza Dushku

[Verse 16: Pressure]
This is my life and many come and go like one night stands
I treat live jams like a sermons, and in my mic hand
A holy gift in which I bless ya
Shit you never spit the fresher shit than Pressure
any means, risk or measure
This cut is deep, so pump a beat for my fuckin peeps
I'm rated X-rated the way that I come with tongue and cheek
We bring the ruckus like truckers in bar brawls
Certified Wise and we out like last calls</pre>
