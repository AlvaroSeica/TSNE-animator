Song:   Build it Up
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, keep building and building
And building, it's my fortress
Nice and sturdy, nice and firm
You know what I mean?
And I ain't gonna stop, man
I'mma build with my family, my love ones
Build up my career, yo

[Dom Pachino]
It's time to build it up, like when we was kids
With them colorful blocks, we was thinking real big
Building like you build a bridge, but don't burn it
Cuz you only got one life to live, you better learn it
So live it to the fullest, cuz where I was raised
There's alotta stray bullets, and equal alotta dead soldiers
I feel I'm getting better but they say I'm getting older
Nah, it's just the beginning, you about to be over
Because it's time for new music, time for true music
Time to show 'em how Dom P do it
Sorta like Popeye did Brutus
You can throw ya hands up, but you know we straight shooters
Power builders and power movers
We could a tower, or, rhyme for hours
We can make the earth shake, thru, snow and showers
And you can bare witness if you came to a show of ours
So get the money and the respect, the power
The silent weapon is your mind in this world of ours
All you gotta do is build it up

[Chorus: Casandre]
Living in the ghetto where you see what you wanna see
You keep thriving eventually, you're gonna wanna be
Nobody's telling, what to do
You just keep building it up

[Casandre]
So many times I tried, so many tears I cried
Please wipe this pain away, where are my better days?
I look up to the sky, and ask him why
But you just keep holding on

[Dom Pachino]
It's time to build it up, like pillars in Rome
I came from nothing, you should feel me, this is fruit for your dome
If I'm starving, I'mma eat, I be looting your home
Yeah, I'd rather think positive, but niggas don't respect it
When you try'nna kick knowledge, kid, gotta pay homage
To the ones who laid the foundation, I build it up
Now when they see me, they say congratulations
Well, shit, it took a lot of work, I lived through the struggle
And I was raised in the dirt, I felt alotta pain and I delt with the hurt
I'm glad I had ambition, overseeing my vision? That's when I made my decision
To make music, til the whole world hear us
Build it up, to the point, where the whole world feel us
Yeah, uh-huh, that's the point that I'm getting to
There's nothing like music that the whole world could listen to
That the whole world could listen to

[Chorus]</pre>
