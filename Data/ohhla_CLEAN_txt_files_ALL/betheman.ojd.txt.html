Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man

[Verse 1]
Chillin in my hood, got diamonds like king Tut
I be in the kitchen making pie like pizza hut
I be on the stove, cooking up the zone
93 the game, but you can call it scrone
I be on the lean, plus I set the benz
Just found Nemo, now I got that clean
And it's my scale, my eyes are triple beans
All we do is win, call me Charlie Sheen
Not enough in the end, too many G's
Too many niggas play the game real creep
I'm a stay one hundred, I'm a keep it street
All I know is G, all I know is G

[Chorus]
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man

[Verse 2]
Tell you about this niggas, who wanna be the man
He don't understand, he fucking touch the pan
He don't get no money and that pussy need to scram
I be in the pie like a nigga cooking egg
With the egg beater only, make some extra benz
Couple benz allowed, stack up me some grand
I keep it one hundred, them other niggas playing
Plus it came in, 500 bricks a saying
Get it to the chris I'm a be the man
36 z, z gonna take a swim
Get it to the chris I'm a be the man
36 z, z gonna take a swim

[Chorus]
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man

[Verse 3]
Wanna be the man, come up with a plan
First you build your team, then you chase the benz
Go and get a spot, open up sharp
One stop sharp, set my change spots
Keeping much a game room and how you stay the nods
No new faces cause their G might be the narcs
They shoot it like a game of pool I'm a be the shark
Er'body wanna be that nigga on top
But they don't understand you gotta crawl before you walk
That be the same niggas, lying in the chalk
Mama always told me gotta listen before you talk
I gotta stay one hundred 'cause them other niggas floss

[Chorus]
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Too many G's, not enough in the end
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man
Er'body wanna be the man, be the man</pre>
