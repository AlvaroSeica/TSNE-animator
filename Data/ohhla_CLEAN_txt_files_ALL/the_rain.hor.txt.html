[Solo]
Have you ever had a day that you wanted to erase?
Tear the page out the history books and try again
But you knew that you couldn't so you put on a brave face
and waited till you could make your escape
And when you finally got away
from the people and the gossip and the judgement in their gaze
You let your guard down and something just gave
All of a sudden, tears falling till they running down your face
Whatever it was, you fought with your friend
or your boss, or maybe you got a heart that won't mend
Or you struggling with the rent, or missing something you lost
Or maybe you're just tired of pretending
You feel the weight like a pain in your chest
till you strain and you ache and you break and you sob
And it's grey till it stops, till it fades
Till it's gone like the tears sorta washed it all away
Sometimes I like to think it's the same with drops of rain
That each one's just a tear falling off of God's face
Sitting all alone in the clouds looking down on us all
Watching every mistake that was ever made
Every bit of pain, every murder, every rape
Every person who's having a shitty day
Taking it all in till he breaks down and cries
Till his eyes dry up and he gets on with it again
And I had this very faith tested on an ordinary day
I was walking down a busy street around my way
I saw a face in the crowd that made my heart skip a beat
A man who looked exactly like an older version of me
So I moved through the hustle and the bustle of the day to day
until me and this man stood face to face
We locked eyes and for a moment time moved in slow motion
as the crowd around continued on their paper chase
I stood frozen in disbelief and opened my mouth to speak
But to my surprise the words wouldn't come
And then he looks into a clear blue sky up above
and say "it's gonna rain", and then it does
And as the rain came down like missiles from the sky
set on a collision course from the heavens to the ground
He's just standing in the middle of it all
Unconcerned by the panic and the people running round
So I stepped to this man with my hand outstretched
Just to offer him some help to get the storm up off his head
He took my hand down and we stood getting drenched
He looked me in the eyes with a smile, this is what he said

Hush child, from the joy to the pain
It'll all wash away in the rain
Hush child, from the joy to the pain
It'll all wash away in the rain
So play this song on the days when the rain keeps on
and you wait and you pray it'll stop
And if you stuck in a storm, then spare a second for the thought
that we all at the mercy of the gods
So instead of looking for somewhere to place the blame
Accept it as a part of that big lazy eight
Go outside and stand under the clouds
and embrace it as the rain keeps plummeting down
And say: Hush child, from the joy to the pain
It'll all wash away in the rain
Hush child, from the joy to the pain
It'll all wash away in the rain
Hush child, from the joy to the pain
It'll all wash away in the rain
Hush child, from the joy to the pain
It'll all wash away in the rain
From the million dollar brands to the tags on the train
It'll all wash away in the rain
From the birth to the dirt man, the cradle to the grave
It'll all wash away in the rain
What's been and gone will come again
It'll all wash away in the rain
So hush child, from the joy to the pain
It'll all wash away in the rain</pre>
