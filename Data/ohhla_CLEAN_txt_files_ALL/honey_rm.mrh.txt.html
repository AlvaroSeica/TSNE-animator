Intro: Mariah Carey &amp; Puff Daddy

oh, oh
Honey got me hooked on you
I like that, uh
I thought I told you
That we won't stop
ooh, ooh (Come on)

Verse 1: The Lox, Black Rob, Mariah Carey

All the money in the world couldn't even amount
To a teaspoon of honey that'll melt in your mouth (That's right)
It's The Lox and Mariah you know you check'n this out
You know they deal a few meals every time she come out
With her blown
And us flown
There ain't nuthin left for us to talk about
But a whole lot of doe

And every current affiar
We there
Keepin' your hands in the air
Like we just don't care (Come On)
Don't be a lier
Would you change your attire (MC)
Get a bomb like Hillshire
Wit the honey like Mariah
Sceam to the ranch then ride a horse
Then come back to the city pushin' a Rolls Royce

Honey you can have me
When you want me
You simply ask me to be there (a huh)
And you're the only one
Who makes me come running
Cause what you got
Is far beyond compare, ooh

Chorus: Mariah Carey

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (That's right)
Oh baby I've got a dependancy
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey (Uh huh)
When it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you
Crying for you
I adore you
Boy you know your love addected me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day 
I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside (yeah, yeah)
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside

Verse 2: Mariah Carey

Yeah, ooh
Oh, I can't be elusive with you honey (I like that)
Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
You're the only thing I wanna do

Chorus: Mariah Carey

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby I've got a dependancy
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey

Verse 3: Mase, Mariah Carey

You know Mase huff, We Puff
We blow your house down
Bring that Harlem world sound
Directly to your town, In fact
This is why I act like that
I ain't dropped one single
And I made this money back
I rock so swell, I gotta prevail
First rap superstar dominating pop sales
You never wish me well cause it start to sell
And it land me with pretty women in the Swiss hotel
And girls that mean a lot
I get em from the shop
Buy them everything they got
From the jeans to the watch
You wanna be my misses
You gotta meet me wanna spoil you with my bitches
And you could tell that Mase is real
Cause he do real things
And I make things thats average look real mean
When it comes to sex I got the real thing
So when you cover your mouth they could hear you still scream

Baby I can love you babe
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah you're on fire)
Gotta hold on love thy saints
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah take us higher)
ooohh
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah you're on fire)
ooohh
(Harlem World we won't stop Mariah take us higher)

(Breakdown)
Oooh, woah (Yeah)
Every little thing you do
(Now what we gonna do right here, we gonna smooth it out, come on)
Ooh, woah, honey, got me hooked on you
(MC, and she won't stop)
Honey, it's like

Chorus: Mariah Carey

Honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you
Crying for you
I adore you
Boy you know your love addected me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day 
I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
