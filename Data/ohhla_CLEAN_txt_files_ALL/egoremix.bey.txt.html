[Kanye West]
I got a big egoooo, hahaha
I'm such a big ego, uhuhuh
I got a big- heheheh, ego
She love my big- heheheh, ego
So stroke my big- heheheh, ego
I like to joke around a little bit but here we go

Welcome to the wonderful world of "go play the Earl" 
'Cuh everything I th'ow up, blow up
Talkin to the girl, she said, "Know what? Grow up, you nasty"
I don't understand why they trippin, if you ask me
Flow just the nicest, I admit the propane I just spit
prol'ly just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club, Try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dog? Tryin to stay recession-free
And spit, refreshly, when I rock the stadi-um
You probably get sweaty, you should bring an extra tee
Now I'm standin next to Jay, who standin next to B
oulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
That's good for egooooo, hehehe..
Me and my egooooo, and it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me, when I was only imagi-ning
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up the Puff and, he'll really know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
or use the arrogance as a steam that powered my dreams of my egooo..

[Beyonce]
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work, 'cause you the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider my-self lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it 
I'd rather you open up my body, and show me secrets 
you didnt know was inside, no need for me to lie

[Chorus 1]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause, he can back it up
He got a big egoooo, such a huge egooooo
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause, he can back it up

Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or, you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find, on what I'm workin with
Dayyyum~! I know, Im killin you with them legs
Better yet them thighs, matter a fact it's my smile 
or maybe my eyes, boy you a site to see 
Kinda somethin like me

[Chorus 2]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this 'cause, I can back it up
I got a big egoooo, such a huge egoooo
But he love my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause, I can back it up

I-I walk like this, 'cause, I can back it up
I-I talk like this, 'cause, I can back it up
I-I I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this, 'cause, I can back it uuup..

[Chorus 1]

Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano
Whoooaaaaaa-whooooaaaaa
Whoooaaaaaaaaa-ooohh-ohh..
Whooa-oa-oa-oa-oaaa-oaooooh
Hah-ah-ah, haaaah..
Oh-whoa-oa-ooohhh...
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-OOOOOOOHH-HOO...</pre>
