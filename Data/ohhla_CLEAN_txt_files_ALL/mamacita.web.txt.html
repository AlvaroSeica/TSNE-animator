Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, yep, my mamacita. Check, okay

She's the picture of perfection let's start with that
Tend to give an elderly man a heart attack
She bad
So God damn sexy
Thinkin' dirty thoughts every single time she texts me
Bedroom hot and heavy
Naked and sweaty
Hour after hour
Non-stop stay ready
We both down for whatever
That's why I got you
And you got me
Till we rollin' to the top boo

She's like a top model
And I'm an I'll rapper
Time to kick it
Roll a blunt
And just chill after;
Pop a pill after
Shit we're both nuts
Tellin' us to slow up
And we're like, so what?

'Cause we don't give a fuck
And they know it
Throw our middle fingers up
Bitch blow it
The sex gets rough
I got the scars to show it
But she's the only one I roll with
That's my baby

[Chorus]
She's the one that I keep to the side of me
Ready to roll
'Cause mami gon' ride with me
From the moment the sun goes down
Untill the moment..
So sexy with every damn thing she do
That's why I can't hold back when I'm bangin' you
She my, she my, my mamacita (cita)
She my, my mamacita

She likes to fuck on the regular
But baby I'm ahead of you
I've been doing dirty
You tamed a sexual preditor
And since
It's hard for me to keep my dick in my pants
I guess this is the chance
For me to find true romance

Mami like 5'2
Dark tan complexion
Nice ass
Real tits
With a slim midsection
I know
Every dude stays lookin' at you
But since you're coming home with me
There ain't shit I gotta do

You do
Something to me
Fucking with me
Under the sheets
Baby girl's nothing but freaks
She's 500 degrees
So hot and spicy
Grab me, scratch me, slap me, bite me

'Cause since she got an attitude
She always wanna fight me
But since I like it rough
We can do it on the nightly
We stay getting drunk and fight
But it's igh
Yo it's worth it
The make up sex is so tight

[Chorus]
She's the one that I keep to the side of me
Ready to roll
'Cause mami gon' ride with me
From the moment the sun goes down
Untill the moment..
So sexy with every damn thing she do
That's why I can't hold back when I'm bangin' you
She my, she my, my mamacita (cita)
She my, my mamacita

She a dime piece [?]
Everybody know her
Girly's well known
Sending me naked pictures on the cell phone
Baby girl
I really think that I'm loving you
Either that
Or shit
I'm addictied to fucking you but..

It's whatever
We gon' ride till the sun's up
HIt it harder then nun chucks [?]
Making you cum, yup
I am one up on all of the rest
Because I do it like I done it
And I did it the best

Sex drive on full throttle
You know what I'm about
What?
Give a fuck
If we wake the people in your house up
Yeah, mami so sexual
Don't gotta stretch 'cause them legs so flexible

Pop an X-pill
And just fuck for 5 hours
From the bed to the floor
And the floor to the shower
Dry off a little and it's back to the bed
'Cause she my mamacita
Yo you heard what I said

Holla (she my, my mamacita). Yeah (she my, my mamacita... [etc]). Holla. (Mamacita...)</pre>
