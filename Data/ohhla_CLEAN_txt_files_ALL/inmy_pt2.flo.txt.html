Song:   In My Mind, Part 2
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
In my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And In my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for

[Verse 1]
I've waited for life
Waited for this time, waited for this moment
To step into the light
Got this drink up in my cup
One night to live it up
You know I'm not stopping till we've had enough

Perfect brother
Can't tell where I'm at, but I'm on the right track
Every time I look back it's a struggle..
[?]
Cause I don't hustle, nooo not dope just hope in my letter envolope check
I got me demo, ohh I'm flo right now, when I go right now
Was it ever that simple, used to roll, get pumped like a pitbull
Out the way said I ain't got potential, get bucked cause I ain't get the memo

Oohh
Take a walk in my shoes
Cause in like my dreams they came true
And I'm a party it up through the roof
Oohh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I've waited for life
Waited for this time, waited for this moment
To step into the light
Got this drink up in my cup
One night to live it up
You know I'm not stopping till we've had enough

Party People
I've got the wind at my head, my mind says yes when my body says
When I eat whow, no it's not an optison, mamma yes I can
Till this spaceship, land with the Beatles
See the road blocks up, and my autograph sucks
But the leech is unbelievable
Got the round, but the bucks not wanna get bucked
But, my fist up, rock star sign
Guitars just broke, in my mind
Was packing up, I might get by
Talking bout luck, on my side

Oohh
Take a walk in my shoes
Ccoz in like my dreams they came true
And I'm a party it up through the roof
Oohh

[Chorus x2]</pre>
