Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I know my life will never be the same
And I haven't given you a name
But even though I haven't met you
I'll be there for you

[Ms Krazie]
I still remember when your life was a dream
when I would sit up every night and pray to God he would bring
Just a tiny piece of heaven back into my life
Another reason just to smile another chance to feel alive
To wake up and to know I have a reason to live
And not complain about the struggles or regret what I did,
But to move forward always keep my head up and look above
There's no reason to cry he muchos menus to give up
So you know my heart smiled when the line came up
I told your daddy right away and his face lit up
We couldn't wait to let thee whole wide world know your coming
little boy would be so cute a little girl would be so stunning

[Chorus]
I know my life will never be the same
And I haven't given you a name
But even though I haven't met you
I'll be there for you
Your everything I never knew I'd want
Your still inside but I can feel the bond
But even though I haven't met you
I'll be there for you

[Ms Krazie]
I always write about you so I wouldn't forget
And counted days until I found Out if you were really there
I made sure I never took anything that I shouldn't
And even held back the tears when you knew I was hurting
I just didn't want you to feel my heart ache
Having you inside and arguing makes no sense
So I'm tryin' and take it easy and I get too upset
When your daddy makes me mad I try to quickly forget
I day dreamed about you and now I'm writing this song
I just wanna let you know ahead of time so when I'm gone
You'll remember that I loved you no matter the time
Way before I even knew I had you inside My Baby

[Chorus]
I know my life will never be the same
And I haven't given you a name
But even though I haven't met you
I'll be there for you
Your everything I never knew I want
Your still inside but I can feel the bond
But even though I'd haven't met you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there overtime you need a hand
I'm your mother I'm your teacher I'm your friend
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
Oh I'll be there for you

[Ms Krazie]
I cant wait to set my eyes on you cutie I swear
Imagine if you look like your daddy gotta prepare
For all the girls and all the problems but ill always be there
And if your a little girl you will have two sisters who care
Your the apple of my eye and I haven't even met you
But I feel you already you know your something special
Just a couple more months until I have you around
Familia equals love and that's just what I found
I LOVE YOU

[Chorus]
I know my life will never be the same
And I haven't given you a name
But even though I haven't met you
I'll be there for you
Your everything I never knew I want
Your still inside but I can feel the bond
But even though I'd haven't met you
I'll be there for you</pre>
