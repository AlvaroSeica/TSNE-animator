[Akir]
Yeah, uhh, check
Get your dough, watch it go, back to the peoples that hold us up
Basic ancient secrets they keepin it's us they stole it from
Peter Joseph told us so, but only those that seem to know
can counteract the status quo or balance back which way to go
My rough ID, C.I.D., used by the beast to track you yeah
Charge in the car can cause an alarm
that's part of the arm that tracks you now
Bags you check in, you go inside, you prepared to fly
Watch for scanners you can not hide
Comfortable you roll no matter what you've done
won't reach the sky, cimbin a tree when I'm gettin high
That Big Brother eagle start to die
No matter what degrees they weave and devise
I'm plantin the seeds so the seeds will provide
A way for us to breathe out the evil inside
Molemen and Akir, the dream is alive
Free from the evils of the dreams outside

[Chorus scratched by DJ DP One]
"I blame it on the government and say it on the radio"
"I have a devil in my infra-red scope!" - KRS
"Every president we ever had lied" - KRS
"Buck buck buck! Cause I don't give a motherfucker!" - KRS

[Beast 1333]
Yo, yeah
The world a mess, we all lust the flesh
I won't stop 'til the people see success
So many beat to death, so many people keft
with the Mark of the Beast can't cheat the test
You bear the Mark, I bear the Mark
With the blood in the waters there for sharks
Now everybody want to be quotin Marx
Little less of the bite and more of the bark
In a world of fakes, here's what it takes
Gotta have big balls not baby grapes
At a crazy pace, let's do it face to face
The whole race chase waste space age sensash'
With a warm embrace, they go and stab your back
It's so whack that the hacks flapjacked the tracks
And when the bombs attack we gon' bomb 'em back
with the cold facts rap tracks catch a jax
There's no latch attached, you can't hold a soul
So don't "Go Go Scroll," po-pop patrol
Let's go toe to toe like pro dojo throws
Sold your soul so don't go so slow
No need to crow, no need to flip
What we need is a change in leadership
Wont even get a chance to plead the 5th
Before the radar go from bleep to blip, bitch~!

[Chorus scratched by DJ DP One]
"I blame it on the government and say it on the radio"
"And if you don't already know"
"I have a devil in my infra-red scope!" - KRS
"Buck buck buck! Cause I don't give a motherfucker!" - KRS
"I blame it on the government"
"Every president we ever had lied" - KRS
"And my hand's on the 16 shot" - Tupac
"Semi-automatic, crooked cop killin Glock" - Tupac

[Immortal Technique]
UHH, you think I don't notice the line when you cross it
I'm like the mind of a genius trapped in a cerebral palsic
You underestimate the hood, you think niggaz is stupid
We read the countries credits, niggaz know who produced it
Why the fuck you think they pushin military recruitment?
America been platinum and she afraid of recoupment
So when you try to close the border, and don't let us in
I'll overthrow California with 20 million Mexicans
Cubans and Chinese who came lookin for freedom
'til they realised America was run by a demon
And I don't mean George Bush he was a fuckin zero
More like the Roman Emperor Nero
who did nothing while the black slum turned to Atlantis
I mean those behind the canvas that made the mechanics and then planned it
It sounds simple but, stupid niggaz won't understand it
until the Mark of the Beast has your face branded nigga

[Chorus] - 2X, same as before Beast's verse

[scratched repeatedly]
"I have a devil in my infra-red scope!" - KRS

[DJ DP One]
"Every president we ever had lied" - KRS
"Buck buck buck! Cause I don't give a motherfucker!" - KRS

[Outro]
Think you safe? Nobody's safe, heh!
