[Chorus: Lounge Lo]
Yes my lord, yes my lord, yes my lord

[Lounge Lo]
New York ain't New York no more, the same rappers
Is saying the same shit, but I'mma open the door
And I'm a Staten Island for life nigga, who push the four
And fuck with bugged out cats who mix kush with raw
Never the less, yea, we bang out, the hallway hangout
Top dog, Beez mode, right in the fort
Skyline with the homey, General Gems Dior
My double seven, three minutes from Broad
And don't worry bout shitting, if I bang for the cause
I'm right here, dead in the flesh, it's lord my yes
Yes my lord, yeah mon', just the Lounger
I'm back in the mix, I'm back in the bricks
With some shit that'll make you go and smack ya bitch
With the thinger, it's Park Hill to the fullest
Gats I pull it, fuck off, yeah mon, fuck off

[Chorus]

[Lounge Lo]
Now it's the nigga tank top, small muscle got the bank stop
And when the games hot, yeah I get ya chain popped
Right on your dame's block, I got a 'caine spot
And two down ass chicks who bust when they aim glocks
Alotta canaries, talk to them train cops
Me I stay to myself, walk on them train cops
Ain't nothing changed duke, we on the same block
Right by the 1-6-Ooh, that's where they slain cop
I do what I do, never lose my game drop
Stupid, stop acting like I won't get you lames shot
Dead in a strange box, you know the name, hop
L to O-U, god damn, same flop
I breeze in the wind, with ease to the plane docks
With a beautiful broad, who only give plain wops
And yes my lord, I see it when the rain drops

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Yes, yessa yessa yessa, my lord
Yessa yessa yessa, my lord, my lord, yes, my lord
Yessa yessa yessa, my lord
Yessa yessa yessa, my lord, my lord, yes, my lord
Ya'll walk with the kid, man, walk with me, man
I'mma rep for the hood, feel my pain
I'mma rep for Staten Island, I'mma rep for Park Hill, man
Ya'll better act like you know what time it is man
This is Lounge Mode Lo, this is Lounger Lo, yessa yessa my lord</pre>
