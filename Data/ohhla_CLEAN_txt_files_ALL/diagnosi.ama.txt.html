[Dr. Ama]
The Doctor, here to read your medical chart
Says that MC's suffer from a weak heart
Before I start you off with an antibiotic
Here's a tablespoon of a real dart, try it
Not that weak over the counter shit, they sell ya
Fuck what the labels tell ya, good for whatever
You also suffer from lack of rhyme skill-itis
In your hood, pretended to be good, rhymed the tightest
Your producer? Knew he was sick, rap track anonymous
Contagious, made you sit and write those weak pages
You dying slow, death comes in seven stages
My whole team should be quarantined, kept in cages
Fake doctor practice, with false credentials
Lay down the pencil game with nothing for your mental
Perscription simple, go with the veterans
7 Over Dosages, heavy metal medicine
Natural antidote, for the poison that they gave ya
Doctor always medically able to save ya
Prognosis great, vital signs stable
Future looking bright like satelline cable
Pin point, the origin of infection
Seven CC's of hip hop's the injection</pre>
