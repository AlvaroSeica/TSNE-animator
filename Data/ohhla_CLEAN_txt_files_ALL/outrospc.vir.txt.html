In the last year I'd come to believe
in such things as spirits leaving the body
and not wanting to be put back
Spirits ANGRY at the awkward places death left them
I understood how crazy it was to think this way
But I was convinced...

[snippets of "The Beast Within"]
"I mean he was ripped to pieces, parts of him was eaten"
"what parts were recognizable"
  "What did it - wild animal?"
"The kind of animal that'll tear a man to pieces"
"and try to set fire to his house?"
"Whatever it was I haven't got any idea"
"It's been quiet as a graveyard around here ever since"

I was waiting, sure the sickness would break
Maybe the next call, maybe tomorrow
The feeling would drop away
I'd always had nightmares...
... but now the ghosts didn't wait for me to sleep</pre>
