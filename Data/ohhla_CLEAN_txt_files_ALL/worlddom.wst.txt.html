There is a threat in the world today!
A threat to our living, a threat to our society
And maybe even a threat to our vary existing
And what is this threat? The WESTSIDE CONNECTION
An organization made up of highly motivated, extremely aggressive
gangsters turned businessmen with one single obective; 
World Domination!! Or in their words; 
"Creating a worldwide West-side"
Vowing to make every man, woman and child bow down to the 'W'
A hand sign used by their members to show affiliation
We have confirmed reports, that W's have been appearing  
on various monuments and historical Landmarks throughout the world
There are also talks Of Mount Rushmore being renamed as Mount Westmore, 
with America's forefathers being replaced by the WESTSIDE CONNECTION forefathers
Ice Cube, WC and Mack 10 
A.K.A. The Gangsta, The Killa, and The Dope Dealer
When confronted with these allegations they released a statement saying...  
Quote... "Bitch, you know the side, world motherfucking wide" unquote</pre>
