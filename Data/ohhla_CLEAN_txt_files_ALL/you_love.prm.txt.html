Song:   You Love My Intro
Typed by: PremRock

I am Napalm to a fake one
Bumping Raekwon
Verbal Intercourse, Knowledge God
Game face on
8 Bar, H bombs, write sharp, razorblade palms
Johnny Walk on the Rocks
No chase on
I relay the charm any stage you place him on
Listening to Ray Charles 
"I got a woman" only if she knows to play along
Lazer lunged son of a gun that sharp tongue
Get my Clark Gable on..
Frankly I don't give a damn
If you got gators on
Or any fashion statement
Know that shit is changing
Later on
Still fresh, with the same kicks now for  six months
Broke off your main chick
6 times... this month 
Shit's fun
Save your product pitch son
Better stick to your Java Script 
Internet thug
Run to the rhythm you coming to get some
Bumping Slick Rick the Ruler
Mad buzzed off of Cuban Rum
Pardon me but sorry my bravado weighs a ton
I'm doing my job knowing my job'll get done
Never sipped Dom P but I read Ghandhi
PremRock rock the party so non-Nonchalantly 
Everything is everything and everything's ill
So I channeled what is real into an energy field
And I'm alright not being a punchline rapper
I just got getting better when it's crunch time mastered
I'm Cool hand Luke meets Kool G Rap
Keep it visceral and Digable I'm cool like that
On the Road to the Riches slash Road to Perdition
Slash know my position that's 
where you bear witness
With the heart race of a Scarface last scene
Activate the car chase the fog lights flash beams
High off of life and some other shit too
communicating with the mothership
another lit fuse
Bugged out since the age of cub scouts pre-teen
Now just a young man trying to follow his dreams
Going for broke from Massachusetts down to Mediilin
Heads are like "Prem, you forgot about the scene"
Only actors are worried about scenes see what I mean?
Ain't nobody on this earth that my music needs to appease
So I trimmed down the fat, hollered at Willie Green
Get these fucking drums out
and let the consciousness stream
On your top-10 blog that's really not for the aim
I been around the world and seen no one had changed
And I can see the hustle, game recognize game
My thoughts stay on a plane of a mechanized train
So I testify love, to exercise gain
You want to do the same thing but you cant
I say peace to my crew
Peace to my kinfolk
You may not know me now but I know you love my intro</pre>
