Temples, churches, synagogues
The whole world has sinned against God (2x)
Repent and conquer
Religion is division
If we are the one
Then what we fighting for

Hey, I was lost then found
Screaming without sound
Feet were stable on shaky ground
The weight was there
To take me down
I had been released from the shackles
I'm freedom found
God owes an apology to Sodom and Gomorra
If he doesn't destroy America
Jezebel is a ticket to hell
Beware of the false prophetess
If flesh is your weakness
If u can walk the talk, shut up
Make a loud noise rejoice and praise
Truth is the way out this twisted maze
It works in wonderful ways
He rose from the tomb in three days
As vinegar to tea, smoke to ice
Slow is a slugger that God used as time wise
Can't sleep during the harvest work diligent
Giving thanks to the struggle and the benefits
Pouring out what he poured in so we can pour more
Loves isn't give and take
Its give without store, riches
Don't profit in the day of wrath
But the righteous aren't delivered from death
Simple as that
Fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge
The more we understand
We give him complete homage
Fool despise wisdom and instruction
Holding on to stupidity with suction
I'm not sucked in the whirlpool
I'm swimming against the current
I ride the wave of living water
Stay with the flock and out to slaughter
I'm the clay and he's the potter,
For sure dude, hey

Temples, churches, synagogues
The whole world has sinned against god (2x)
Repent and conquer
Religion is division
If we are the one
Then what we fighting for

When fear comes or distress
We call on God
Though we ignore him when everything's in order
Prayers get answered but not always in our favor
The harvest is plenty
Though the laborers are few
There's nothing to argue
Even though I'd like to
The word is my eternal revenue
Wisdom is better than rubies, silver, or gold
It's higher in value plus more durable
He rebukes those who he loves, loves who loves him
Even loves the sinners but not our sin
Compassion, beyond my comprehension
The life I'm living now
Is a gift of extension
Hate God love death
It's like the spirit is a prisoner of our flesh

I can't go there yet, people just aren't ready for it

Temples, churches, synagogues
The whole world has sinned against God (2x)
Repent and conquer
Religion is division
If we are the one
Then what we fighting for.. huh?what?</pre>
