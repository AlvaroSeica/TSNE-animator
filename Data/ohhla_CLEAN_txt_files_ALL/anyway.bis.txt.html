[Verse One]
Is it me, or is this music shit wack?
Could it be, this rap shit it's a wrap?
How did we, get so far off track?
To the wack then you automatically get a contract
The south?
You can't hate on that
But a lot of rappers comin' out of there is real wack
Snap music, I get it
The bitches love it, admit it
But +Aye Bay Bay+, I'm not fuckin' with it
And ain't got to
My music likewise
Different strokes for different folks, they showin' the same signs
Punxsutawney Phil I keep seein' the same guys
Ground Hog's Day I keep hearin' the same rhymes
If anyone's offended, shit I ain't gonna apologize
I feel like Bill Murray, want to break my radio
Neighbors wonder why record sales ain't poppin'
Don't just blame digital downloads, it's the bullshit your droppin'
 
[Chorus] [Mike Ant]
You might not like what I'm bout to say
But I'm gonna say it anyway
You might not like what I'm gonna say
But I'm gonna say it anyway
 
[Verse Two]
Honestly, honesty don't offend me
Honestly, that's all my pen be
Rappers got a problem, we ain't gotta be friendly
But stop makin' songs for kids and leave that to Disney
I don't listen to kids, kids listen to me
So when they grow up who you think they wanna be?
Hopefully not me
I'm no role model
But I roll with a model, smash it like avacado
Raise yo' kids stop raisin' hell
Stop blamin' 50 Cent when young Johnny go to jail
Be A Parent Or Die Tryin', you ain't done too well
I don't know yo kids, it's not my fault if you failed
But Oprah said it's rap's fault, disrespectful to the female
But what does she know? She's finger bangin' Gail
I could be right or I could be wrong
Let he without sin cast the first stone
 
[Chorus] [Mike Ant]
You might not like what I'm bout to say
But I'm gonna say it anyway
You might not like what I'm gonna say
But I'm gonna say it anyway
 
[Verse Three]
New York, New York big city of dreams
Niggas swear they gang bangers, it ain't all that it seems
Is Jim Jones a real Blood?
Ask Big Wide
Oh Wee and Young Dre will get the truth, no lie
I ain't really like +Ballin'+ but I like his style
And Juelz is dope but cut that Blood shit out
See Mims did his thing, it ain't like he can't rap
But a fake south track ain't gonna bring New York back
And the west coast?
Our shit is trash
New west full of pests, hate to see you get some cash
Old niggas too, the torch they refuse to pass
Rather see it go out until they croak and pass
L.A. full of haters that's why we don't last
I see why Dre don't fuck with niggas, do his thing and mash
+California Love+, that's a thing of the past
You wanna make it in Hollywood, you better drive right past
 
[Chorus] [Mike Ant]
You might not like what I'm bout to say
But I'm gonna say it anyway
You might not like what I'm gonna say
But I'm gonna say it anyway</pre>
