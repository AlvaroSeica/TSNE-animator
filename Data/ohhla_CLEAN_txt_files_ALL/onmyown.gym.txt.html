[Travie McCoy]
I wish I could unzip my skin, take it off
Just to take a walk - but I can't do it
I don't think I'll make it on my own (on my own)
As when I take out my pen
And I wage it all
Turn the page and fall
It just comes natural
I'm gonna make it on my own (on my own)

[Chorus]
I just need time to walk it off - but I can't do it
I'll write it on my own time, I'm
Hey look I made it on my own (on my own)
I know she thinks that I don't try
but I realize that I can do better
Write, write on {*4X*}
Makin a mess as I progress no time to cry about it, do better
Write, write on {*2X*}

[Travie McCoy]
I wrote the greatest lines at the strangest times
Now it's payin off, but I still feel lost
cause I can't do it
I don't think I'll make it on my own (on my own)
So in between now it pacifies
I change my name to free, plus she feels safe to me
So I'm livin dangerously
I'm gonna make it on my own (on my own)

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
Write, write on {*2X*}

[repeat to at least 4:10]
Write on, write it on your own time (write, write on)
