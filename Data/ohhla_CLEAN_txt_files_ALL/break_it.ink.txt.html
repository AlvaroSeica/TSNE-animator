Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
She knows how to break it down
I can give her that (Give her that)
Give it to her, laying on her back. Yeap
Pound that pussy like a dap. Hope you ready for attack
Turn it up, climax
Call me Santa Clause, sitting on my lap (On my lap)
Now bring it back and take them panties off
Let me see that ass
Turn me on all night baby I can duralast Uh
Put it on the dresser by the lamp (By the lamp)
Biting on her neck like a vamp (Like a vamp)
Got her wet, way past damp doing thangs she ain't doing with her man

[Chorus]
She know how to break it down
Put it all on me
I can break her down.. to a piece (Oh yeah)
She know how to break it down (She know how to break it down, down, down)
Girl I can break you down (Girl I can break you down, down, down)

[Verse 2]
I can give her that
Give to her. Laying on her chest
Sweat marinating on her breast
Go to work, lay her on the desk
And take them panties off
No. Girl you can leave them panties on. Uh
And I can pull it to the side, once I get inside
Say she ain't a freak I guarantee you that she lyin'
Baby girl let it go (Yeah)
Go n' let it show (Uh)
I thought I should let you know (Yeah)
Your pussy is incredible (Yeah)

[Chorus]
She know how to break it down
Put it all on me
I can break her down.. to a piece (Oh yeah)
She know how to break it down (She know how to break it down, down, down)
Girl I can break you down (Girl I can break you down, down, down)

[Verse 3]
Yup. Down for the count
Hook that pussy then I knock that ass out (Yeap)
I said she's down for the count shoulda seen when I put it in my mouth

[Chorus]
She know how to break it down
Put it all on me
I can break her down.. to a piece (Oh yeah)
