Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I guess it started watching mom and pop have it
Then lose it, like loose change
Liquor bottles that spilled ain't kill this nice pain
But I salute the fact another couple made it
30 some odd years
Tear filled, and these rips stain
And I would stare through the windowpane
Trying to capture what they would call a silly game, but
Things change
The rain stayed the same
And love just became a cold house in chains
You see, its a shame
The moment that I'd get it
So unequipped for love
I'd fuck it up in a minute
But you? stuck to me
Your words cut through me
And holy ain't the word
But God sent you to me
I thought I was cursed with feeling the way that I'm feeling forever
Stuck in these strings that's supposed to be severed
As if its not enough, feeling ashamed
I guess I got your heart caught up in the same game
And they tell me
Play well
Play well
You're young, so
Play well
But now the feelings that we feel do dwell
Upon something you decided to tell right now
Heart's beat in tune, so I guess we on the right track
Still healing from my past cracks
But, 'til I say those three words back?
Just know where my heart's at</pre>
