Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: K-Mac]
ballin like a bitch, you can't tell me nothin'
cause I'm ballin like bitch
(uh-uh-huh) filthy ass rich
swimming in this money
cause I'm ballin' like a - ballin' like a
ballin' like bitch, b-b-ballin' like bitch, (uh-uh-huh)
filthy ass rich, swimming in this money
cause I'm ballin' like a - b-ballin' like a

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
look, bbc hat clean diamond snap Chorus
take a picture with it, like it's my last look
gold mac book, cost $100, 000 g's
I don't fuck with rats, I throw away the cheese
I'm ballin' baby, you see this nigga shine
I'm running shit (cb laughs) finish line
K-Mac cook that beat, I eat like it's dinner time
awards show gimme mine, loud and clear (intercom)
listen up, I show you how to stunt
pocket full of money, you should see what's in the trunk
that bass got that bump, that shit that make you jump
ballin' like I'm bitch, throw it up, slam dunk
v-neck like a quedo, rollin' dice in the casino
three bad chicks rollin' trips (cee-lo)
what's done is done, ain't no coming back
I'm ballin' like a bitch, roger that, it's breezy baby

[chorus: K-Mac]
ballin like a bitch, you can't tell me nothin'
cause I'm ballin like bitch (uh-uh-huh) filthy ass rich
swimming in this money cause I'm ballin' like a, b-ballin' like a
I'm ballin' like a bitch, ballin' like a bitch
b-b-b-ballin' like a bitch, watch me do my shit
cause I'm ballin' like a bitch, ballin' like a bitch
ballin' like a bitch, watch me take your shit

[Verse 2: Tyga]
uh, snap back, nigga back up in this bitch
throwing by the $100's watchin' strippers do the splits
go on hit that flex, I ain't trippin' on the bitches
probably, 1 out of a 10 in california, I ain't hit
bitch, I'm raw smell that shit,
hold your jaw up in your lips
get a silly straw, have a sip [laughs]
mo'fuckin' Tyga, she ain't met me, then she lying
I pull that rocker out nigga, david and goliath
melt your fuckin' face boy, like that nigga on the wire
them niggas washed up need a dryer, dry 'em
free my brother weezy, now we back up on your TV
I'm rollin' at 250 speedin' me my nigga breezy
right behind me, range-rove, t-real ?
bunch a bad bitches tongue tied and bitches what it do?
It's young money till the death bed
If anything, we the best ? and it's probably... this

[chorus: K-Mac]
ballin like a bitch, you can't tell me nothin'
cause I'm ballin like bitch (uh-uh-huh) filthy ass rich
swimming in this money cause I'm ballin' like a, b-ballin' like a

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm ballin' like a bitch, ballin' like a bitch
b-b-b-ballin' like a bitch, watch me do my shit
cause I'm ballin' like a bitch, ballin' like a bitch
ballin' like a bitch, watch me take your shit
