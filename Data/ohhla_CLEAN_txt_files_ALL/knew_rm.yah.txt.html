Intro (Missy)
Hello, (Brrr), hit me on my car phone  x3
Hee Hee Hee Hee Haw, Hit me on my car phone

(verse 1)
If your girl only knew
That you was trying to get with me, (what would she do)
If your girl only knew
That you was dissin' her to talk to me

(chorus)
Why you wanna play me, don't play me
You can't fade me, don't fade me
Tryin' to persuade me, persuade me to get wit' you
Why you wanna play me, don't play me
You can't fade me, don't fade me
Tryin' to persuade me, and if she only knew

(verse 2)
If your girl only knew
That I would want to kick it with you, hey
And if your girl could only see
How you be calling me, getting fresh with me

(chorus)

(Missy Rapping)
Ooooh, if you a chicken head, ba-ba-ba-baw
All up in my grill like ill
Cause I wear Nikes and do not wear Brigettes
I s---- over in my lex and see you drive by in your chevettes
I burn baby, burn, burn. Every time I twist my hips, 
I see your boyfriend turn, turn,
Is it your concern, to see to not to look boo, 
what would she do if she knew

(bridge)
If your girl only knew (Hit me on my car phone)
If your girl only knew (Ooh, hit me on my car phone)
If your girl only knew (Hit me on my car phone)
If your girl only knew (Ooh, hit me on my car phone)

(Missy Rapping)
Oooh la, la la, goo goo, gaa gaa
Tell ya Mama and ya Papa to chuckle wit laughter
Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee
