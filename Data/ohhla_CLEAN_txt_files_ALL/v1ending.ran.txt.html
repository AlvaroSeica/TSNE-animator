Mr. Jarbo is faced with the ultimate dilemma
If his students don't attend class, or improve
he will be terminated
But how can he get his students off the game
and into the classroom
with "KillCount" sweeping the nation?
Is this the end for the teacher/rapper/hero?
Stay tuned to the next exciting episode
of Mega Ran - in "Language Arts"</pre>
