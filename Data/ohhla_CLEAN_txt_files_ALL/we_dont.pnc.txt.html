[Kangol Slim]
I'm Kangol Slim that's Mista Meanor with the four solid golds
We bout to break it down to you
We Don't Love 'em Thoe

[Mista Meanor]
I say I don't want an o'l lady
You can keep the dog chicks
But she better have a job
Cause I ain't no trick
Yes I want me an outfit and two more golds
I might like me a trick
But I don't Love 'em Thoe

[Chorus]
I Don't Love 'em Thoe
I Don't Love 'em Thoe
He Don't Love 'em Thoe
He Don't Love 'em Thoe
Cause We Don't Love 'em Thoe
Cause I Don't Love 'em Thoe
[3x]

[Mista Meanor]
Remember that One-90-One
I g'd that girl once again
I made her switch her foul mood and
Jump on her best friend
Now some may call me a dog and
Others say it's a shame
But it's an Big Boy thang and
I'm ture to da game
Now this girl had some ducats 
She had a car yeah buck it
But it didn't bother me cause you know
That I stuck it
Then I hit that girl on the fast and
Had to dash and let that broad know
That my name is Mista Meanor and
I still Don't Love 'em Thoe

[Chorus-3x]

[Kangol Slim]
You remember that chick I met on a Sunday night
I took her to the Teli on an all night flight
I rock it back back forth n forth
I made her feel so good 'til she almost crooked and
When I caught me a nut
The chick said she wanted ends
I said chick you must be sick cause I ain't gettin' up no dividends
Before I hit the door through on my rope and my Kangol
I told you before
I still Don't Love 'em Thoe

[Chorus-3x]

[Kangol Slim]
These girls out here say they want them a trick
But my name is Kangol Slim and all I'm givin' is stick
So if you down with me and 
You Don't Love 'em Thoe
Just throw yo hands in the air and let me know let me know
New Orleans if you down and don't love 'em thoe
Throw yo hand's in air, let me know, let me know
Texas if you down and don't love 'em thoe
Throw yo hand's in air, let me know, let me know
Lafayette if you down and don't love 'em thoe
Throw yo hand's in air, let me know, let me know
Shreve Port if you down and you don't love 'em thoe
Throw yo hand's in air, let me know, let me know</pre>
