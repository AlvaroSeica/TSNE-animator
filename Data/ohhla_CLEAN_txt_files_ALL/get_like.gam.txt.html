[Childish Gambino]
Dude wit a hoodie and hair in cornrows
with a dick size bigger than niggaz in pornos
that satisfy cause they know that I care physically
I walk inside the party and know I'm the man instantly
I hate bars, I can't stand the club neither
I'm not dancin; I'm fuckin havin a seizure
A lyrical legend lately a lot of punks pussy
Got that ice needed for niggaz to call their pimp pushy
I bite niggaz heads off; call me alligator
I wear bright clothes like a pack of Now &amp; Laters
My hood is Darth Vader, cause that's my light saber
and my golf socks will probably make your eyes dilated
Pimp juice concentrated, my swagger fresh squeezed
and them haters can't stand it cause they got weak knees
Treat banks like restaurants, pass the cheese please
Yo I'm the bees knees I got little kids saying like

[Chorus]
"Get like me, get get like me" {*8X*}

[Childish Gambino]
My flow is retarded, call me +Rainman+
cause I make it rain man! My hoodie print bright
like a fuckin toucan, "What's the Frequency Ken?"
Kicking it with french girls like the can-can
We can be friends, call me Adam
Cause I am the man - let me put it like this
Rappin ain't easy, there's only me and Weezy
and Jeezy, Kanyeeze, boys wanna be me
but my swagger's off the heezy - call me Crime Mob
I run the big Apple like my names Steve Jobs
My shoes custom made, white top bright green
My pants top shelf so I call 'em high jeans
My clock is sick like the hospital; so if you see
somebody vomit in the street I'm probably responsible
If I got the extra dough, I buy these kids a bunch of ice creams
Not the food, but the shoes so they walkin down the street like

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
Uh-huh
Yeha that's how we do it
Gambino~! Y'all know how it is
Just mob like that
Uhh!</pre>
