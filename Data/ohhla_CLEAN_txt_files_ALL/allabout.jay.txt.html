It's all about the money
Nothin but cash
No matter how much you front
If you spend too much, it won't last
So peep it out

[ VERSE 1: Kool Rock Jay ]
A cool brother on the street
It ain't a person in the world that he can't beat
Tryina make money the best way he can
Because he knows a broke brother's what a girl can't stand
Life is hard in the real big city
Without no money you don't get no pity
You're tryina be hard and you're tryina be cool
But see, you're out of a job because you didn't go to school
What's the real tip about what you need?
You know you need money with the quickest speed
The brothers on the block are makin all the cash
While you try to front and say that it won't last
But you know you need some, so what can you do?
But sit around lookin like a stupid fool
You say to yourself, "Shall I sell drugs
Or work for the mob, then become a thug?"
But the very next day you get a job
At the same damn store your partners robbed
And day by day and week by week
Well checks keep comin and life's so sweet
But Monday morning just ain't no fun
When you're waitin for the bus and the bus don't come
You get on up and then you go on home
Then you call the job on the telephone
Your boss gets mad, the next thing you find
You're standin in the unemployment line
They give you a hard time about your past
So you tell everybody to kiss yo - chill
Now you're broke, homeboy, and you didn't save
And your new girlfriend is puttin you in the grave
I'ma tell you like this, it ain't a damn thing funny
It's the '90s, man, it ain't nothin but the money

Cash
Money
M-o-n-e-y
Talkin 'bout money

Money

[ VERSE 2: Kool Rock Jay ]
A young lady workin nine to fifve
Chillin with her friends and kickin it live
Spendin cash money at all the malls
The girl's havin fun, she's smooth havin a ball
But then she meets a dude with real long hair
Sweeps her off her feet like savoir-faire
"Hello, how you're doin?" is all she heard
She became his girlfriend with just those words
Then she took him to the pad for a bite to eat
Now dinner's over and it's time to freak
She wakes up in the mornin and he's lyin around
Sheos are on the table and pants are on the ground
Sayin to herself that it doesn't make sense
While she's wonderin in her mind, could she be that dense?
The brother woke up to a smooth goldmine
Had credit cards to use all the time
Now bein a sucker, which he is
Homeboy played the girl for the next two years
So if you listen to me, cause I'm a real MC
In the '90s, well, that's how it's gonna be
It's all about the cash, if you got it make it last
If you spend and spend, then it's gone fast
I tell you like this, ain't nothin funny
It's the '90s, babe, it ain't nothin but the money

Cash
Money
The m-o-n-e-y
Talkin 'bout money
Cash
Money

[ VERSE 3: Kool Rock Jay ]
Well it's concert time and it's time to rhyme
Serve the party people at the drop of a dime
You get on stage and you do yo show
But it's somethin 'bout the show you really didn't know
You wasn't gettin paid from the first you rapped
Now you're lookin sort of funny, what's up with that?
And you say to your homies, "I need money"
While the promoter's laughin like everything's funny
Broke ( ? ) because he wasn't legit
So let me tell you from the first since you ain't hip
Before you rap and cap, before you rhyme and scratch
And the party is packed, this is how you should act
Walk on stage, but don't do no rappin
Let the promoter know exactly what's happenin
Tell him to sign on the dotted line
Or you jump off stage because he's wastin your time

It's the '90s and I'm talkin 'bout money

Money
The m-o-n-e-y
Hit it

Money
Money

Yeah

Money

Talkin 'bout money

Money

Dollar bills
Dollar bills
Dollar, dollar, the dollar, dollar bills

Talkin 'bout that cash
