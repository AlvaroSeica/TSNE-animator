Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
I got purple in my swisher
Purple in my cup
Purple, purple in my wine clap
Purple label up
Grapes what's up
Grape, grape, grapes, what's up
Breakfast

[Verse 1]
Oh it's Kreay baby
Oh hey, baby
I get to work, you just lazy baby
I need my break, now when where and how
This second right here with a couple pounds
I be town down dropping in the scraper
I've been around my world doing shows and getting paper
Need my medicine, again, again
I'm with 2 Chainz with two bricks in two hands

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm hungry, hungry for this money
Call me Kreay Hefner, playboy bunny
'Bout that juice, cheese, bread - breakfast (breakfast)
Stackin' dough, for breakfast
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
'Bout that juice, cheese, bread - breakfast (breakfast)
Stackin' dough

[Verse 2]
Eight in the morning and I'm up yawning
My phone almost dead cause everyone is calling
It's breakfast time and I need my apple jacks
And I need my fresh grape syrup and a money stack
We're just popping off just to kill shit
And we drink a lot so we don't feel shit
She's in her birthday suit and she's cooking too
Yeah it's breakfast time but it's only two

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm hungry, hungry for this money
Call me Kreay Hefner, playboy bunny
'Bout that juice, cheese, bread - breakfast (breakfast)
Stackin' dough, for breakfast
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
'Bout that juice, cheese, bread - breakfast (breakfast)
Stackin' dough

[Verse 3: Chainz]
2 Chainz! Ugh... I'm up now
Smoking on that loud until the sun down
Beating on that pussy 'til the sun up
You don't like what we doing shut the fuck up
Me and Kreay that's all I gotta say
I don't see a lil' nigga, the money in the way
Lil' Wayne unquote did it from the A
When I'm in California, bitch I'm tryna fornicate
If you ain't talking money ain't no need to conversate

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm hungry, hungry for this money
Call me Kreay Hefner, playboy bunny
'Bout that juice, cheese, bread - breakfast (breakfast)
Stackin' dough, for breakfast
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
'Bout that juice, cheese, bread - breakfast (breakfast)
Stackin' dough

I got, I got all the syrup</pre>
