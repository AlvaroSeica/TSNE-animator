[Intro]
Yeahhhhhh~!
Yeahhhhh... AH! AH
... AH!

[Intro]
Burn up front do', hard wood flo'
Money on the table, I'm in my stash house
Bricks goin in, birds going out
I stashed a hundred mill, off in my stash house
Order on two, order on white {*3X*}
Especially for tonight, it's some Shawty Redd drums

[Chorus One]
Burn up front do', hard wood flo'
Money on the table, I'm in my stash house
Come on cash out, birds in a drought
Whole lot of soft, in my stash house
If it don't jump the first time, cook it again
Then call the dope man and shorty get you a ten
Then, then call him again
Then call the dope man, then call him again

[Gucci Mane]
I'm so gangster and he's so corny
I'm so hood that the hoes get horny
Oh-seven Corvette on off-set shorties
If those the new twenty then order me forty
Gucci Mane rabbit drums made by Shawty
The hood say we what's up like Bart
Ralph Lauren sheets with the Polo cut
'71 Chevelle and they sittin on buttons
'76 I-L and it's sittin on Ashantis
The kid straight blunted smokin top notch chronic
A pound of what we smoke cost ninety-five hundred
I smoke it all day back to back, it's nothin
Gucci Mane trick on a bitch, no cuffin
Baby sucked my dick I gave her two clean hundreds
I didn't have a deal niggaz thought it wasn't comin
Never spent a rap check yet, no stuntin, it's Gucci

[Chorus Two]
Burn up front do', hard wood flo'
Money on the table, I'm in my stash house
Bricks goin in, birds goin out
I stashed a hundred mill, off in my stash houuuuuuuse
I'm in my stash houuuuuuuse {*3X*}
Gucci Mane in the stash house

[Chorus One]

[Gucci Mane]
Headed up I-10 with a couple of hens
In a bubbled eyed Benz cause I'm gettin it in
Got a a team of kickmen I be sendin them in
Kickin do's off the hinges tryin to cop by the ten
If a nigga touch a hair on my chiny chin chin
on my chinchilla trench, then we spendin a Ben
Got a Russian armor handgun it's my best friend
Shawty Redd in the Bentley, Gucci Mane in the Benz
Drop a baby in the pot, it do what it does!
When I pull it out the pot, I'ma serve it to cuz
Heavy wrist activity that started my buzz
White diamonds in the Bart look like lil' light bulbs
It's Gucci

[Chorus Two] + [Chorus One]</pre>
