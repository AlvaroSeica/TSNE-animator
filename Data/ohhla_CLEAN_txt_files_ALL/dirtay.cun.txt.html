Aight c'mon
Why you tryin' to play all innocent?
I just seen you with him
I seen you with him
I seen you with her
I seen you with her
I seen you with them
I seen you with... with everybody
c'mon... stop frontin' like you ain't

[Verse 1: Wordswoth]
Dirty chick, been in thirty dirty flicks
Thirty-six, you woulda hit it if you seen her curves and hips
Had a machine that shocked her nipples, the pain tickled
And had a candle she wanted to burn me with, I'm not into that
I'm not saying I ain't into rack
I'm weird too, I like to fuck in my socks and winter hat
Her bedroom walls were pink, her lamps were dildos
Huge panties as a sheet and had tampon pillows
Waterbed a vagina so it's always wet
A vibrator installed to shake during sex
Sadomasochist: leather whips, bats with spikes
Enjoyed being (?) until she was a battered wife
We slept and then I said what you waking me for?
Her daughter's birthday it's too late to go to the store
It's her daughter so I assumed she was sorry
When she dumped out my sperm and used the condoms as balloons for the party
She's dirtay

[Verse 2: Deacon]
sellin pussy out on the ave
always in the clinic talkin bout "put it on my tab"
now she's in my grille (?)
askin' if I need some
blabbering about a threesome
she got a light skin friend look like Betty White
Got a dark skin friend look like Wesley Snipes
see (???????)
with that funk in her cunt that you could cut with a machetti knife
they'd never trap me
not even pretending they was three christina aggie's
and fuck them through plastic baggies, nasty fatties
I clown hoes
if you pussy ain't got a rash why your clit look like a clown nose?
with no standards in mind
she'll hook an ugly dude up with brain faster than Dr. Frankenstein
no doubt the vilest chicken
you'll need long division in countin' the 69's that she's been in

Somehow it's become dirty
And you never dreamed it would go this far
You thought you could quit anytime you wanted to
With tremendous desires but get the beat up on you

Somehow it's become dirty
And you never dreamed it would go this far
You thought you could quit anytime you wanted to
With tremendous desires

[Verse 3: Rise]
But you could get a taste freebie like market's and grapes
She got Rakishi finisher she'll throw her ass in your face
disgrace, cause she look so gorgeous a model
more hands got rubbed on her than a log at Appollo
baby got some big ticks, kids mad since the day out
the baby got bit by a crab on the way out
mad they got played out
I don't wanna touch what they do
but only your ass... that's all your mama gave you
act wrong I had did knock her boots
hats stacked on like cats in doctor suits
don't do what donnie don't does claims my view
and that's a trick stunt David Blaine wouldn't do
I bid her adieu, I'm no longer hittin' her shoe
now I'm pissin like (?) when I'm finished the brew
Her inners are huge, her (?) filled with bottles of pop
Mad niggaz hiding from cops hide in her twat
She's Dirtay

[Verse 4: Deacon]
Dirty indeed
surely had a dirty disease
call herpes and fleas
they'd jump on your shirt from her jeans
plus a chuawwa and pit she'd kiss on the lips
and let them eat (?) off her tits
and grits off her clit
she was a trick
I don't mean to diss cause I hit
while I positioned her lips on a box of chicken strips
she chomps on twizzler sticks
pretty face but she's grimey
with a food fetish thats why she weighs 390
super-sized freak at McDonald's she flirts
into beastiality, her chuauwa get's hurt
does she wanna get (?)
I suggest you don't
she's even thrown ass at the whole cast of best of show
her favourite position was doggy style I told her to pose
but when I pulled out a hot dog fell on my toes
I said HOLD UP!
if you see, oh you need surely leave early she's dirty
