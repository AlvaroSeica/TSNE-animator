[Intro: ODB (Kanye West)]
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
Yo, you ever went over someone crib
They had every piece of equipment ever made
They had MPC 5000, they had 12 keyboards
They had a record store in they crib
My only question to these niggas, is, um
Where your plaques at dog?

[Chorus 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now take that equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore?
Guess not mothafucka, it's The Roc mothafucka!

[Kanye West]
The backbone of this like Marino to the Dolphins
Most hits out the shot since Sosa and Andre Dawson
My niggas had Pro Tools, I had no tools
Karaoke machine, fuck it I'm old school
Only difference is my tracks drove niggas postal
So I drove costal while they stay local
How I can't rhyme when my freestyles'll roast you?
Sit down I'll coach you while we style in posters
Dog, niggas had a chance to sign me, dropped the ball
I'll see you at the awards.. HUMPH!
Now after all that it took
I made it to The Roc, I'm guess I ain't as dumb as you look

[Chorus 2X]

[Kanye West]
I need a, straight cheater, straight through Cheetah's
Straight to my crib, faster as a cheetah, way she a beater
Cheapest thing in my apartment, like Ikea
Keep your hands out my freezer, and your paws on my beeper
I praise my nigga Loon, like damn, you need it you can keep her
Fam, I ain't dealing with these video divas
And when I go out to eat, she don't want me to park in a lot
So I gotta feed the meter, 'fore I feed the divas
She act like she need the reefer like Queen Latifah
There go another reason why I need to leave her, look
Let me tell you a story of, how I meet Gloria
In the corridor of the Waldoff-Astoria
She said what she sporting been imported from Armani Emperium
Cuz Diesel and BV was boring her
Plus, it's been a whole lotta slow singing
Sampling, ever since my name started ringing

[Chorus 2X]

[Kanye West]
Now.. I showed you how to do this, dog
Put a few beats on the tape, I saved this one for myself
I heard you nigga's tapes, need a little bit of help
But I'm rappin' and I can't do nothin' for ya, man
S.G'll hop this, 40 grand if you ain't fam
I mean, if you ain't Hov', if you ain't Cam'
Damn, I know you say he's killin' hisself
He got a little bitty deal now he feelin' hisself
Yup, just cuz I played beats and act hospitable
Don't mean I can't get you changed to hospital you
I'm from a raw family, dog, and I'll spit on you
So play like a kid in the garden and get little you
Who ya hype man? I'm curious
It got you souped up like the cars on The Fast &amp; Furious
You goin' through movin' critters, now who's laughin'?
The best producer that rap better than the rappers

[Chorus 2X]
