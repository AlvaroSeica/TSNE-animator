(*talking*)
Whoa, Big Pokey, Lil' O
S.U.C. in the do', (uh-huh) yeah
Put your dranks up, it's going down
 
[Lil' O]
If you the freak of the week, then we like your type
Cause Lil' O and Big Poke', man we like the dikes
 
[Big Pokey]
Get the left hundred right, with a babe on the back
M-O-B style, I'm a motherfucking mack
 
[Lil' O]
If I get you in the sack, you gon' know I'm the truth
I'm Ray Charles baby, I'ma make you do what it do
 
[Big Pokey]
When I get through with her, I'ma let the crew hit her
Went to bed with her, but she woke up with a new nigga
 
[Lil' O]
We can play switch-a-roo, take dick from two
Cause I share mine, like a pimp would do
 
[Big Pokey]
It's a one night stand, is you with it or what
I'ma treat her like a slut, I'ma dig up in her guts
 
[Lil' O]
If I tap you on the butt, don't think it's to drank
Lil' O's a kinky dude, I just love to spank
 
[Big Pokey]
Don't chase me, chase the ring
I can't do nothing with ya but hit ya, and let you taste the shame
 
[Hook]
Cause I can make you, feel so good
Just do it just do it, cause you know you should
Cause I can make you, feel so right
Just do it just do it, cause tonight's the night it's a one night stand
 
[Big Pokey]
I can see it in your eyes, you want me up in your thighs
Fantasizing bout a player, we can do it anywhere
 
[Lil' O]
I'ma grab you by the hair, I'ma spank you on the rear
Then I kiss you on the ear, then I jet like a leir
 
[Big Pokey]
I'ma get up out of there, like a track meet
Unless you blow a nigga, like a fat sweet
 
[Lil' O]
I got a pretty white girl, that love black meat
I got a bad sugar brown, with a fat seat
 
[Big Pokey]
I got a hoodrat, on the back streets
And a six footer, that's a athlete
 
[Lil' O]
I got a hot lil' mama, that love it from the back
Call her back seat freak, cause she love it in the Lac
 
[Big Pokey]
Baby need a pack, all the mics she wreck
The head was cool, but I just like the sex
 
[Lil' O]
If you like the X, I can get you pills
Then you can blow me like a bag of kill, for real
 
[Hook]
 
[Lil' O]
I'm looking for some late night hype, a one night stand
I ain't trying to gal you, I'm a one night man
 
[Big Pokey]
I got one night plan, that's menage you baby
You can ride a nigga dick, like a Harley baby
 
[Lil' O]
If you ask do I lay, I say hardly baby
Wanna get my affection, gotta spoil me baby
 
[Big Pokey]
I like a gorgeous lady, in a large Mercedes
I'm a player off top, so it's hard to play me
 
[Lil' O]
Ay I like jazzy hoes, I like glassy fo's
And if you ain't putting out, then your ass can go
 
[Big Pokey]
I wanna give it you, all night long
Have you running round, S.U.C. shirt in a all white thong
 
[Lil' O]
I want you, no shirt no panties on
So I can hull your cock out, like damn he wrong
 
[Big Pokey]
Damn he long, hit her with the tool
Woke up from her snooze, like damn he gone
 
[Hook]
