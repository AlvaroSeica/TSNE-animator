[Intro: Amiri Gamble]
Yo, uh... I can't believe this is
Going down like this...
Uh, I can't belive this is happening
Amiri Gamble, Makeba Mooncycle
It's like that, uh, for the next year

[Amiri Gamble]
Remember how we met? It was on the internet
I was checking out your site, so I wrote you a let'
I saw how you was cool with Talib Kweli
Well now you cool with me, it's your boy Amiri
You did joints with Lyte, and Lone Catalysts
Tony Touch and Sunz of Man, but still you stand all alone
With no deal, just a microphone
Pass that, if you forget, I resurrect the queen dreads

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Sitting in my room, writing a ritual rhyme
Verse four thousand and one, and the public still blind
I wasn't resurrected, see I stay on they minds
Aims for perfection like a fine red wine
I'm rising to the top, cuz they're's mountains to climb
And my body has no movement, cuz I'm feeling the blind
I was on hiatus, from the haters, immitators
Like the, hurricane out of action, still the greatest
Fronting with a smile, when you know that they haters
Mad at the fact, I'm old school and the latest
Trained with the thugness that I have inside
Still a true fan with the others alive
Don't fight the feeling, cuz I'm so damn high
High off this beat, that you know I like to ride
Never doubt my skills, cuz others can't grasp
Still remain the best, and I'm always out to last
I am the future, flashing back from the past
When you knew I was good, I rewinded that ass
I blow mean, keep it thick like protein
I sold ki's, I complete like fro sheen
There's no one better, old school like suade sweaters
The pro setter, on the move like go getters
The back burner, killing comp like Nat Turner
You're Ike, baby, make me believe I call you Tina
How's life, baby, think twice, I'm still a dreamer

[Interlude: Amiri Gamble]
It's like that? Or we continue with this, yo
Amiri and Makeba, check..

[Chorus 2X: Amiri Gamble, Makeba Mooncycle]
Amiri and Makeba, smoking on some trees
R-H-Y-M-I-N-G
First come the streets, always on the grind
This is real hip hop, the only way we survive

[Amiri Gamble]
Yeah, as we survive, like Travolta stayed alive
I stay rocking to my beats, niggas always feel the keep
What you see is what you get, never nervous, never sweat
What the next man's doing, this is real, still pursuing, what?
Others quick doing, dreams were ruined, just cuz you went
The crew call it a wrap, but I remain on tap
With that old school rap, that old school snap
Niggas give me dap, cuz they say I take 'em back, yeah
To say the newest, something is the truest
Amiri and Makeba, fuck the haters, yo, we can do this
Backpackers make me sick, cuz they ride the dick
They hear one hot album, now that crew is the shit
And then the next album drop
And what you thought was hot, was really not
Many times I seen cats step up, for that next spot
You had a nice debut, but the new joint is not

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Amiri Gamble]
It's like that, ya'll
Amiri on the track, ya'll
Makeba Mooncycle, Amiri Gamble
For the '05, we going to stay alive
Hip hop, hip hop, hip hop, yo
Never die, never die </pre>
