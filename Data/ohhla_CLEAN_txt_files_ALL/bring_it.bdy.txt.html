[Verse One: Ice-T]
The moment I laid the eyes on you
I knew a close encounter, was inevitable
Now we're alone, your eyes staring deep into my soul
Together we sit in darkness
You know I want you
Your voice sounds like a God in head
You know I am you
Don't ask my name, it don't matter at all
You know that love just ain't my style
I feel the heat of your lust in the air
We have no choices left, as you walk into the vampire's eyes

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Let me bring it to pain, let me bring it to pain
Let me bring it to pain, let me bring it to pain

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
You say your love is a spiritual thing, I hear you
You lick your lips like a lioness, I fear you
You touch me and my blood runs cold
Am I the hunter or hunted?
God put us here together tonight, you can't escape fate

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Let me bring it to pain, let me bring it to pain
Let me bring it to pain, let me bring it to pain

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
My tongue journeys deep inside you, your juices arouse me
I am your slave tonight and forever, dominate me rape me
Your orgasm is so wild, it's a trip, we cum together as one
You say you gotta have it hard and rough, is this rough enough?

[Chorus: Ice-T with variation]
Let me bring it to pain, let me bring you to pain
Let me bring it to pain, let me bring you to pain
