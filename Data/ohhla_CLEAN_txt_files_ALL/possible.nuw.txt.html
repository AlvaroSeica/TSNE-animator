[Verse One]
I can't calm down
Now take a demo tape, and spit positive thangs
Be real man not fake
Brushing off comitts, got no time for hate
I couldn't wait, to get this thang moving
Whole family's bobbing they heads, and thugs grooving
Business is war, and love is raw
Tug-a-war in this spirit realm might be a skull
Now here we are, I opperate in Gods law
It's insane, passed the brain but I can touch a star
I don't know anything else, but taking over
Craziest man you ever seen, in a cream Range Rover
I understand, if you don't like me
You stereo type me, skip my style and try to bite me
Some get hot and try to fight me
But it ain't me, the Holy Spirit I'm not excited

[Chorus]
Mission possible, we taking over baby
Mission possible, we taking over baby
Mission possible, we taking over baby
Mission possible, we taking over baby

[Verse Two]
Now hold up playa, don't trip get hostile
I'm a strip, beat, in five breathin penicostile
I raise my hands, cuz I'm sure
God's own, black own entrepreneur
My daily income is a million
Slippin in the S ? and let it grow to a billion
Provide jobs for seven million civillions
And what this worth in heaven, that's a hundered trillion
Bind up ghetto neighbourhoods
Cleaning is up, making it look like it should
It's all good, cuz with Jesus theres no limit to His provision
I made a decision, I grabbed the bloaw and took a vision
See I been doing this thang, for a minute
And I'm the first of my kind, but it's plenty
Plenty mo', I'm letting radio world know!
That we're coming through the do'

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Wood grain panels, matching trill
Ivory door handles, on platinum rims
Eleven T.V. screens ??
Bought a million dollar guitar, for guitar slim
A hundred million dollar mansion, shaped like ?
Gotta 747 with a work out gym
It's recorded from the top, got it all on film
A little blessing from the Lord, yeah it came from Him
Came along way, from the corner packing a sign
I came along way from the corner, slanging them dimes
I came along way from jacking, get up out the ride
Over night at Kinko's, printing out ? slides
I love the Lord, not these material thangs
Just letting you know, living the life for Him is what it brangs
You see my hands raised high, you see me shipping lanes
But if I didn't have a thang, I would still say

[Chorus]</pre>
