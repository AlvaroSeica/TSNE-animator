Verse 1 *(Rame Royal)*

I reside
in Oakland, California Eastside
ain't no bullshit
I mean to the fullest we ride
be wise if you ain't ready for trigger action
niggas may ask ya now
when I comes to blastin
the sons of fashion
it's too much
like gettin touched for rappin
slip the clip in you fucked
won't even know what happened
unload, close caskets from the cappin
defaced
erased
can't be replaced
it's a disgrace
vet players set this pace
can't keep up
We leave you wit what?
Hit your chest
Like kicks from the bass?
Someone should of told you
I'm from the old skool
meanin the cold dude wit heat
when I hold my two
make your whole body go like Jul's
then disinigrate
slugs penitrate any thug
don't discriminate
I mean this
go up in you like intervenous
witness' forgettin this
ain't seen shit
they fiend this
Town's Finest
few dank hits
YaHighness
wrap that ass up in a blanket like blindness
dump you in the trunk punk
wit the pump, mass, an semi
while I toast yo ass wit the Henny.

Cuz I'm the type of nigga
that's quick to blast
fuck wit me
I bust a cap in that ass
cuz I don't give a fuck
I buck an keep bailin....
I hope you bitch niggas ain't tellin!

Verse 3 *(Gonzoe)*

I'm 21 now
burn keys of weed down to ashes

sip Henn outta Champagne glasses

cuz they give us
a foul hand to work with
I keep takin hits from the deck until it's perfect
my sister's smoked out
an I'm stuck feedin her kids
work my site phat on the block
and it's worth ends
so fuck it
ain't no luck in this game
it's Rame's thinkin
I ain't lookin in the police face wit out blinkin
can't crack
the eye contact
I give that shit right back
talk to him wit this thang on my lap
maybe it's my habitat
my surroundins

bout hoochie bitches
Cutlass'

It's Gun Powder.

*(Rame Royal)*

Cuz I'm the type of nigga

Verse 4 *(Crown Jul)*

We got Downtown livin

if you ever need a friend
call the heater man.
