Song:   Carousel
Typed by: cool_jeezy45@yahoo.com

It's crazy yo, it's like...
First my life is like a roller-coaster
Now it's like a carousel, y'know, going in circles
When will it stop

[Chorus]
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
My life is spinnin' 'round and 'round
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
I think I need to slow it down
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
My life is spinnin' 'round and 'round
Somebody let me off this muthafucka
I think I need to slow it down, down, DOWN

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo me, G' and Khary
Three the hard way
J. Nix, MK-6: take yo' pick man
Matter fact take six man, take a breather
I'll make it easy for you
This merry-go-round ain't merry at all
Danny wanna hop off this carousel
But scared he could fall
Figured I'd make a few beans with my daily routine
But if the monotony's making you scream
Then what's the ride worth?
Yo, what is my purpose?
If I could fly from this earth, I would
And gain perspective like a third eye could, but ummm
Everyday is like a rat race
Try to escape, fall flat on your face
'Cause in between the shows and the interviews
Dough and the scent of new
Hoes, centerfolds waitin' backstage in the nude
I sorta lost control
My star status got me feelin' mad exhausted yo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Was interrupted in my thoughts by this shorty I used to rap to
Back when I had two at a time... I was that smooth
I ran into her at the State Fair
She told me '"we should do lunch"
I said "fuck it", and we just ate there
We was a great pair; we talked candidly
About the romance that we had in the past
She's gassed 'cause I'm rapping and I'm big time now
I asked how she was doing and she gave me a half-smile
Now that's wild
We made our way to the ride with the unicorns
And the moon ornaments -- how appropriate
she told me it had been four years, still got no associate's
Degree, and now she's trying to cope with the debris
Of a marriage gone wrong, baby carriages on the lawn
Said she got a seed, six years old and can't read
I'm like, "whoa, slow up your speed"
She agreed and nodded her head
Bugged me out when she said

[Chorus]</pre>
