[1 Type: CHORUS]
Live for to day now, forget about tomorrow
When you blaze your own trails
You really don't have to follow

[2 Type: VERSE]
When I woke up this morning, I jumped out of bed
Took a shower put some pants on, my hat was red
I need a grab a jersey then brush my teeth
I need a shave my face throw some shoes on my feet

[3 Type: VERSE]
I was fresh dressed like a million bucks
Saggin' in my ten dicks with a tear on my nuts
Now there's things to do and there's people to meet
Set some goals to achieve, Johnny Richter, whatchu think?

[4 Type: VERSE]
Another day full of new opportunities
Another sunrise, another chance for you to be
Whatchu wanna be? 'Cause you ain't gotta be a follower
You're the prophet of your prophecy

[5 Type: VERSE]
It might sound like I started preachin'
But I'm searchin' out the fun, yo, I'm always seekin'
Livin' out my life like an endless weekend
And I just keep doing it again and again and again and again

[6 Type: CHORUS]
Live for to day now, forget about tomorrow
When you blaze your own trails
You really don't have to follow
Free your mind, your soul is sure to follow
Live for to day now, forget about tomorrow

[7 Type: VERSE]
Twenty four seven, 365, one day at a time is how I live my life
It's Johnny Richter and I'm breakin' out
Makin' moves, doin' things, that's what I'm all about
I'm tryin' to go everywhere, North, East, West and South
Never thinkin', when I'm speakin' let it all hang out

[8 Type: VERSE]
What's comin' out my mouth? A little freedom of speech
I said, what's on my mind and my mind I believe
I can do anything, don't accept defeat
I'm just tryin' to get by while smokin' on some trees

[9 Type: VERSE]
It's a beautiful day when you see the sunshine
It's a beautiful day to relax your mind
Get down to the sounds of the D L O C
Everybody come and join the Kottonmouth Kings

[10 Type: VERSE]
Throw your hands in the air, let 'em go on be free
You can be exactly who you wanna to be
When this world is crazy, gotta give it all you got
There's no time to slip, I wanna be on top, check it

[11 Type: CHORUS]
Live for to day now, forget about tomorrow
When you blaze your own trails
You really don't have to follow
Free your mind, your soul is sure to follow
Live for to day now, forget about tomorrow

[12 Type: VERSE]
I really can't explain, my brain just works in different ways
From livin' life against the grain, hopin' to die just different strains
When I rip the pipe, the sun shines in my life just right
I'm about to reload, then ignite
One life, one love, one mic, one stereotype

[13 Type: VERSE]
The TC got til the fruit is ripe
Pick up the pen, uplifting in sight
The weakest link my be the one in the light
You gotta stay true, stay strong, hold tight
This is Daddy-X and I'm rick, rick white, worry about it

[14 Type: VERSE]
Wake up everyday and I wash my face
And I look in the mirror, deep inside I gaze
Into my eyes, check the vis, feel out what I'm gonna do
'Cause the sky's the limit, whether me or you

[15 Type: VERSE]
If you really stop and think, it's not that hard
You can be anything, you are a superstar
Keep your head on straight, be a leader, don't follow
Live for to day and forget about tomorrow

[16 Type: CHORUS]
Live for to day now, forget about tomorrow
When you blaze your own trails
You really don't have to follow
Free your mind, your soul is sure to follow
Live for to day now, forget about tomorrow

[17 Type: CHORUS]
Live for to day now, forget about tomorrow
When you blaze your own trails
You really don't have to follow
Free your mind, your soul is sure to follow
Live for to day now, forget about tomorrow</pre>
