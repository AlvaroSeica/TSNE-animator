[Introduction]
You got to follow me with what I'm doing right here man
Like, when I say this shit is crazy, I don't mean it's crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it's fuckin'- like it's actually crazy

[Verse 1]
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fucking with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated with the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait
Is fate procrastinating
I can take it cause I might be right, cause it's

[Refrain x2: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
The girl of my dreams
Ay, is she good as what she seems
Or am I lying to myself
Ay, should I try and get some help

[Verse 2]
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Ay, tell me is it stalking if I follow her like all the way home
without her knowing
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
Imagine what she'll say to me: this ain't no time to be afraid no more
It's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy, this the girl of my dreams

[Refrain x2]

[Verse 3]
Look, I spot her walkin' in the mall
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my god, I'm walking towards her
My mind screaming stop, but my legs keep walking forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you coming for her
My heartbeat racing and my hands keep shaking
Say something, you shy motherfucker, she's waiting
"What's up girl, don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women
But you from my dreams, and will you come true
I know about a show that we can catch, some R&amp;B and rap, and you
should come through"
She said, "Uh, I'd love too, except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would
like that." (Damn, Damn)
Okay, you say you got a man, I mean, I definitely understand
I'm happy for you, really am, I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie, well I'm sure that I'm gon' see you around the city
Only thing I ask if shit don't work out for y'all, then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme to get the girl of my dreams

[Refrain x2]

[Verse 4]
So I find out the nigga name, know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work. "Hold up nigga, is you sane?"
I'mma follow in my car; I'mma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall, maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time, then console her while she crying
She gon' take that as a sign; finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen when I hit her with ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing

[Refrain x2]</pre>
