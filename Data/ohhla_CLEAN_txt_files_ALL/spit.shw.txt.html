[Verse 1 - A.G.]
You know we got it sewn for now
Cause I throws it down
Plus I'm frozen down with a golden sound
Where that lye at?
I blow blunts backwards nigga try that
Expose these hi-hats to my raps
When my gat blow it's more than just about rap
Strong hand the Giant and his fam
I doubt that, gon' make cats flip with or without rap
But still make hits and shit where your mouth at?
How's that?
Bounce the track with a rap I doubt you pack
I'm straight up motherfuck y'all cats is out the back
I must confess I smoke bless
Blessed to make the loot investin' my troops
And holdin' rests known for chest in arrest
Home alone with some dame
Name the weed Sharon cause I'm Stone
I rock the five the dire
Next stop is the money train
See me in the Range then you know that the money came

[Verse 2 - A.G.]
Wanna be blown retarded I got a Jones for dollars
And if you know what I know you'll say "hoes hit the hardest"
Roll with known robbers but still burn scholars
With PhDs my degrees is 360
Merced off in the zero that follows the fifty
I believe I can fly even higher than these trees get me
I brought the Desert E's with me
With more clips than a bag of roaches
I'm mad explosive
Keep watchin' y'all fowl like judges in boxin'
Out fox'em you better hold your head it's not an option
Excel on the spot you're shell shocked I shall rock
At first it was catch and kiss now hoes catch a dick
Like 62 grams I flip quick a brick couldn't slow me down
Cause only I hold me down
Now these hoes Change Faces they wanna stroke me now
Cause they know it's me but next move it's get O.U.T.

[Verse 3 - A.G.]
Aiyyo in God's name I grab mics and create flames
and blaze shit leave 'em in amazement with basics
Face it, I'm the dopest in here
Checkin' for the second baddest bitch
Cause the first is who I came with
I peep the fiend to Roc Raida playin' again
We got 'em namin' like some D that's waitin' a ten
You sport the ice and rock the Role', I done that
But here's a jewel a nigga once told me; run that
It's real feelin' steel on ya back
Listen closely now I choke gats for shit like that
Wanna rise to the top they wanna take what we got
But Allah is the master plan on some last plot
Nigga front like my shit ain't hot, I go bananas
Similar to scamas on some unidentified shit
So peep the livest
Don't sleep cause I don't like surprises
The Bronx got more stripes than tigers</pre>
