Song:   Racist People
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We don't like racist people black yellow white pink or orange
we don't care we just don't like racist people no no any way
we're all the same but in different good is good evil is evil

When will you learn people are people

We don't like racist people so step up in you pace
and be the same you should be ashamed

Don't judge me from my skin colour because were all the same
remember back in the days we didn't get along now we do

We don't like racist people so step up in your pace
and be the same you should be ashamed</pre>
