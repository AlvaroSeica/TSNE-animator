[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Niggaz With Attitudes, get on the floor!
Niggaz With Attitudes, get on the floor!
Niggaz With Attitudes, get on the floor!

(*Sample of Police Sirens*)

I'm comin' straight outta Compton ---&gt; Ice Cube

(*Sample of Police Sirens*)

[Ice Cube]
When Somethin' happens in South Central, Los Angles
Nothin' happens, it's just another nigga's dead (*Echoes*)

[Ice Cube]
Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggaz With Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fucked with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm goin' out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showin' out
Niggaz start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix them and cook them in a pot like gumbo
Goin' off on a motherfucker like that
With a gat, that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no tellin' when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep you dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool (*3 Gun Shots*)
Don't make me act the motherfuckin' fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knockin' niggaz out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back, boy, I'm comin' straight outta Compton

[Skit]
Y'all, aooh, aooh
(*Eazy-E explodes a Patrol Cops wagon*)

[Chorus: DJ Yella scratched Quote below]
City of Compton --&gt; Toddy TEE
City of Compton --&gt; Toddy TEE

[Eazy-E] Yo, Ren
[MC Ren] What's up?
[Eazy-E] Tell them where you from!!

[MC Ren]
Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this
But the pussy ass niggaz won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jackin' the crops
Just like burglary, the definition is jackin'
And when I'm illegally armed, it's called packin'
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy, I go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'm a call you a bitch, or dirty-ass whore
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, cause I'm tearin' up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker, that starts static
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself 
Every time, I pull a AK off the shelf 
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, cause I'm the motherfuckin' Villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's takin' place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangster tip
Straight outta Compton (*Echoes*)

[Dr. Dre] 
Eazy is his name and the boy is coming..

[Eazy-E]
Straight outta Compton, is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raises hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfuckin' cop I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kind of funny, the attitudes showin' a nigga drivin'
But don't know where the fuck he's goin, just rollin'
Lookin' for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload, you see, it's about to over the hesitation
And hear's the scream of the one, who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin'
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin'
So what about the bitch who got shot? - Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? - I ain't a sucker!
This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever fucked with me
You'll get taken, by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton
