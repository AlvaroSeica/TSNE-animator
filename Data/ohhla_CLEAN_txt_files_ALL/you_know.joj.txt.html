[Intro: JoJo Pellegrino]
Pellegrino movement, Cologero The Great
E Nicks, blood sweat and tears, day to day struggle
You know I'll make it, ain't no stoppin what's next
South Shore Stuff, yo

[JoJo Pellegrino]
As far back as I can remember, I wanted to be a rapper
Hit the big time spittin rhymes in arenas with speakers blastin
People who took half of my life I killed in projects
Opressed, warring amongst the greats with ambitions to be the best
And I've been caught scaling the fence with my friends when the guns are poppin
Freestylin battling heads on the ferry while the bums are watching
Hood times are good times, almost got wet
While see my love get infinite respect when she jump infront of the tec
My life saga, there's drama in the second stanza
Marry your ???, notice your crabs bitin lobsters
That's why you trying to stop tha
Kid in the procedure to prosper, but I'm a monstah
The reason why the chickens is sweating
The reason why kids wanna stick and opress him
Destined to see the day, but all at night I'm stressed
Cuz the only thing you guaranteed out of life is death, but I'ma make it

[Chorus X2: JoJo Pellegrino]
This is my life, that is my struggle, these are my words
South shore stuff
That's the objective, these are the goals, this is the memo
South shore stuff

[JoJo Pellegrino]
I'm in a sort of low run, my daddy struggled for starters, I can't describe it
See the big picture, most of these dudes is near sighted
In a game where nothing matters except for who you know
See the record execs is fat cats, politics determine on who will blow
A&amp;Rs fanagle the system, smuggling the wealth
While there are artists stuck in the gutter such as myself
JJP, spittin for eleven years south of two of them
Your preppy general manager don't know what to do with em
I put it down for dough, remain focused
Here are the cards, I got an ace for your jockers
I'm bad at sparking cuz I doubt your stuff
The founding father to this south shore stuff
Come on, rock with me, climb from the bottom to the top with me
It's nothing, hit the booth on BET and drop fifty
Destined to see the day, but all at night I'm stressed
Cuz the only thing you guaranteed out of life is death, but I'ma make it

[Chorus X2]

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Pellegrino's young and aggressive, with wisdom like I studied them lessons
And understand we got heart but keep them under the vests
Life can change in only a couple of seconds, I'm counting all of myblessings
Got you listening, like 'son is impressive'
Thats how them kind of haters be screwin the kid
I keep my lights on and my food in my fridge
I think the fact the certain cats is runnin these companies can ruin this bis
The term's morbid, cuz it ain't about the music, strictly paper when they turn corporate
Force the kid in the middle of ??? the widest street on pause, flooding with soft shit
So have no fear I'm here, and I solomny swear to provide intense skill for your ear
Set a standard from the burbs to the bricks
See who resist is getting burnt to a crisp
Destined to see the day, but all at night I'm stressed
Cuz the only thing you guaranteed out of life is death, but I'ma make it

[Chorus X3]

[Outro: JoJo Pellegrino]
Yeah, you know I'll make it, uh huh
It's been a long time coming, the unstoppable, the undropable
The unpoppable Pellegrino</pre>
