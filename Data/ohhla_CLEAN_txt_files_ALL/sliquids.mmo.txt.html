[Intro: Itchy-Finga Sha]
Uh, what, uh, bring it M.M.O.

[Chorus: Itchy-Finga Sha]
Tears bring flares, you hold black fears
We your last thing, constently handstick
Ain't no reign in us, cinnamon tux', sippin' brew and cuts
M.M.O. click, we spit liquids, what, what
Hold you head in critical, toe to toe, I handle you
Cats catch through my vocal, fool, is strictly for my crew
Tears bring flares, you hold black fears
We your last thing, constently handstick
Ain't no reign in us, cinnamon tux', sippin' brew and cuts
M.M.O. click, we spit liquids, what, what

[Trigg'nomm]
Professional, perdictable, double a vest, calico
Oh what a mess, foul blows, run of a nose, drown the hoes
Look how I gotta go hallow hoe, shatter bones, blood cologne
Call Metrodome, Cyclone Zone, Astro-Land, business man
M.M.O., droppin' dough, hate to say how the haters play
Dogg like Snoop, so let me through, oh, one poochie, hoochie, sue me

[Naisha]
See ain't no day, sell these records
psycho kane done freak this flow
Ya'll niggas don't know, gotta search them
or the plush condo now he ? the titty blow
Catch me sick to the bath-hole, never that though
Shorty in the back,  ?? macro, ?? got smack-o, ? that good?

[Chorus]

[Itchy-Finga Sha]
Hold you head in critical, inter borough bell views
Stagger left an edge or two, gettin' them up to get that loot
Tellin' your cats is bulletproof, words is told by truth
Take your mind like smith I goose, born 'em with the playas
Though we suffer cast, fire last, lace the smoke with strictly hash
Facial fifty strictly -- pimped out, never had
Got no time to show the past, loose your life in jungle blast
Money Makin' got cash, super see you like glass
Twelve laws of offer dough, now or later, M.M.O.
Time we time we show picasso, designer clothes, doin' shows

[Chorus]</pre>
