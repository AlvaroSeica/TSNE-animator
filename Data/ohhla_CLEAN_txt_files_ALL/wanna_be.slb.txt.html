Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Trae]
Ain't no tripping baby, so I advise you hop out my ride
And off top, it ain't no drama allowed inside
No need for no confrontation, I ain't got no time
The only time I got to give, is when I fuck and I grind
You must be out of your mind, see I'm a player by nature
How the fuck you gon hate a G, cause he be after his paper
And all them late night anonymous phone calls, really ain't the thang to do
So when you see me peep the dub, as I keep on flying through
I use to be a nobody, but nobody's money
So nobody wanted to be down, ain't that kind of funny
But I bet you sick now baby, I'm a thug on a mission
Relationship ain't even part of my decision
You know what it is, I'm only being real I'm sick of the games
Ain't nothing but negative thoughts, everytime they speak on your name
And it's prolly the only reason, I be zoning alone
And I know you fake, ain't no way you gon be part of my home

[Hook: Dallas]
I know, you wanna be down
But you really, fucking up my zone
Hanging around
You could never be part of my home
I know you wanna stay, for my do'
Get your shit, and get the fuck out my do'
(it could never be you and me, and you know you out of line)

[Jay'Ton]
I peep you sitting on my jock, fascinated by diamonds
Amazed how I use my slang, when I'm spitting and rhyming
I'm a player baby girl, I see game a mile away
I'm a grown ass man, and plus a nigga need space
I know what you be about, with all your hating and lies
And all hell done broke loose, when I got in them thighs
I shoulda never slowed down, and let you get on my team
The only thing you ever wanted, was to get in my green
And I ain't mad cause now you on your own, whining all night long
And don't call my cell phone, bitch I'm gone in my zone
When I'm flipping, in my Lac
J2 on my side, with two bops in the back
I admit I'm a mack, hopping in and out of cat
I might put her on a track, just to get some money back
I'm a P-I-M-P, plus I know you live shife
The only one I need is me, when it comes to my life

[Hook]

[Lil' B]
Baby girl, I know you wanna chill for real
But I'm a hustler on the grind, trying to stack me a mill
It ain't no handcuffing or nothing, when I'm in town
Just me stuffing inside your guts, then I move around
Cause I'm a player by nature, with game sharp as a razor
Don't be lying to your friends, saying Lil' B date ya
When I be at the studio, you wanna blow me up
Calling my cell phone, rushing me to pick you up
Then your friends say I'm a dog, baby girl that's true
In and out of towns with hoes, what you want me to do
(say no) I'll say yes, cause I know what's best
You only after me, because I'm chasing bread confess
That's why you need to beat your feet, and leave my home
Cause you a nagging lady, messing up my zone
I can't be playing house, making you my house wife
It could never be you and me, you just some nice hype

[Hook]

It could never be you and me, and you know you out of line</pre>
