[Snoop Dogg]
Winners... everybody wants to be a winner
Winnin is everythang huh?
Nah, winnin is the only thang

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Winnin ain't everythang, winnin is the only thang
When you're livin life in the game

[Snoop Dogg]
I can jump out the jet, I can run, I can swim
I'm heavy on the case, I stay in first place
Mud on my shoes, taste blood on my face
Out of town, touch down, never out of bounds
I train for the gold, I can go twelve rounds
Steel City baby, we are Superbowl bound
Recollect and sag while I check a checkered flag
All this winnin got me grinnin all this losin got you mad

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
No mo' Chuck T's on my feet
It's just Adidas, man they kept it true to the streets
And like U.C., I'm on a 50 game win streak
I can't be beat, I am the real heat
Real kings real rings that's what we say
I threw a shutout and cut out, I'm on my way
PGA, fall under he may play
It's where AMAZING happens in the NBA - ay!

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Aiyyo, we don't take 'em on the Westside
Yeah! I was born to be the best right
Rest and sleep is for the weak
The last shot y'all can go and put it on me
The last swing, the last throw
W is all a Dogg know
W-I-N, W-E-S-T
O.G, Snoop D-O-double-G

[Chorus]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, no matter what game it is
Winning... it ain't everythang, it's the only thang
And make sure you go hard, blood sweat and tears
Shout out to all the winners out there
That's all I do is win, ya dig?
It ain't easy
Congratulations
Win on!</pre>
