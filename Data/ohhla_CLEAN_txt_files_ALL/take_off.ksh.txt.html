[Intro]
There's a place downtown, where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all

[Ke$ha]
When the dark, of the night, comes around, that's the time
That the animal, comes alive, looking for, something wild
And now we lookin like pimps in my gold Trans-Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey in my handbag
Got my drunk text on, I'll regret it in the mo'nin
But tonight, I don't give a
I don't give a {*2X*}

[Chorus]
There's a place downtown, where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
And they, turn me on, when they, take it off
When they, take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know, if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore, and there's glitter on the floor
And they, turn me on, when they, take it off
When they, take it off, everybody take it off

[Ke$ha]
Lose your mind, lose it now, lose your clothes, in the crowd
We're delirious, tear it down, 'til the sun comes, back around
N-now we gettin so smashed, knockin over trash cans
E'rybody breakin bottles, it's a filthy hot mess
And I'm gonna get faded, I'm not the designated
driver so I don't give a
I don't give a {*2X*}

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Oh-ah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
OHHHHH, EVERYBODY TAKE IT OFF!

[Ke$ha]
Right now, TAKE IT OFF~! {*3X*}
Oh-oh-oh-ohhh
Right now, TAKE IT OFF~! {*3X*}
EVERYBODY TAKE IT OFF!

[Chorus]</pre>
