[Soulja Boy]
Get out the WAAAAAAAY~! Pretty boy comin thru

Girls on me heavy 'cause I look so sexy
Yellow diamond shawty, in the club straight flexin (Soldier)
I'm lookin for a yellow bone long-haired star (star)
Thick, in the hips come, get in my car (Soldier)
You party wit a star, we take off and go to Mars
Pretty boy take off in 5 - 4 - 3 - 2...1

[Chorus]

[Soulja Boy]
I'm pretty, boy swaggin, in the club I feel sexy (No homo!)
No homo shawty, but my chest is straight flexin (flexin)
Tatted on my neck, shawty said she choose me (choose me)
She got nice titties and a fat ass booty (booty)
Took her to my condo, let the girl strip

Damn I like the way, lil' mama shake that ass
She pretty, girl, dancin while I pretty, boy, swag - GOD-DAMN!

[Chorus]
