[Hook]
It's too late to turn back now
I just can't go right now
I'm caught up in this dope game

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe
I'm caught up in this dope game
(Repeat)

[Verse 1]
I got 4 eyes and 2 heads, growing dreads
And the feds wanna see a nigga dead
Shit, I ain't scared to die
If my babys gettin fed
Y'all hoes wanna come to my house in the morning time
Asking me about some hydro sticks
All y'all hoes can kiss my ass
Guess what I done already smoked the shit
Tell the snitch that sent you here, he overwith
I'ma cut his throat, I'ma scale his ass
I'ma do him like a dead fish
Shit, you wanna tell 'em somethin, well go tell 'em this
Ya ol' man is a weak bitch
He got fucked up in '96 with 8 pounds and 5 bricks

[Hook]
It's too late to turn back now
I just can't go right now
I'm caught up in this dope game

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe
I'm caught up in this dope game

[Verse 2]
See, you ain't know that I can freak like this
You ain't know I make beats like this
You ain't know I talk this much shit
(Female): "Fuck Mr. Bigg"
Fuck you Bitch
Fuck nigga you hatin' on me
Ya ol' lady she chasin' me
It ain't my fault you ain't fuckin her right
And the bitch at the motel waitin on me

[Hook]
It's too late to turn back now
I just can't go right now
I'm caught up in this dope game

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe
I'm caught up in this dope game

[Verse 3]
Yeah baller you got that 'cain
Sweet daddy do yo thang
Dirty rats is out here in the game
They done took yo picture and told yo name
Got damn its a rat race
Hundred thousand in a suitcase
Twenty-five years is what you face
On that hot ass interstate
Now they got'cha, what'cha gone do?
Ya road dawg done told on you
Remember that time when you gave him one
Told him to bring ya back twenty-two
Well guess what?, he got caught
Went to jail and got right back out
You don't believe me dawg tie him up
And I bet that fuck nigga wired up

[Hook]
It's too late to turn back now
I just can't go right now
I'm caught up in this dope game

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe, I believe
I'm caught up in this dope game
