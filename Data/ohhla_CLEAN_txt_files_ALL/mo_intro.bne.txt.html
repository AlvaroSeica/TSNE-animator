[Preacher 1]
We believe that it is better
To love than to hate (Air raid siren. Thunder)
At the same time, we warn this nation that our
people are growing tired and they are growing restless

[Krayzie]
The mighty, mighty, mighty
Mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty Mo
The mighty, mighty, mighty
Mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty Mo

[Felicia]
Mighty mighty

[Preacher 2]
These are the things that we about tired of
We wanna bring the truth to light and let it shine

[Krayzie]
You could ride if you want to
Or you could die if you want to
But I don't want to
Fuck it, c'mon and ride

[Felicia]
It ain't nothin' but a thang
If you wanna hang with the Mo Thug family
Rippin' shit up, tearin' down walls
Gettin' suited up for the cause
You can roll with us
Or we can roll without you
It's all up to you, so what ya gonna do?
Mo Thug comin' through, so make way

[Preacher 3]
And there's no need of runnin'
And no need of sayin'
"Honey, I'm not gonna get in the mess."
Because, if you were born in
America, you were born in the mess

[Krayzie]
You could ride (ride) if you want to
Or you could die (die) if you want to
But I don't want to
Fuck it, c'mon and ride

[Preacher 4]
We've got to walk together children
We can't get weary</pre>
