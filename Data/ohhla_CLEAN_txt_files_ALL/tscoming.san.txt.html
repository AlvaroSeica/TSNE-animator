[Intro]
San-tana..
I mean even though we stand alone, we stand together

[Just Blaze]
Ladies &amp; gentlemen, prepare for landing
Fasten your seat belts, thank you for flying Air Force Airlines
Oh and me.. call me the captain.. Just Blaze!!

[Juelz Santana]
They say family that prays together, stays together
And one that walks apart, just falls apart
So, together we stand, divided we fall
United we form Voltron and take on all (Let's move)
Yes, the birds left the nest
I'm all grown up I gotta fly with the rest
Best of the best, is what we strive to be
A legacy is what we tryin to leave
Let's say good-bye to the past
The future's here, at last...
The second coming, the new beginning
The truth is speaking, you should listen

[Chorus]
So glorious, victorious
We take what we want, we born warriors (ay!)
So glorious, victorious
We take what we want, we born warriors (ay!)
If you fall, get up and try it again (uh-huh)
If you drop, get up and try it again (uh-huh)
If you fall, get up and try it again (uh-huh)
If you drop, get up and try it again

[Juelz Santana]
We tired of being runners up, we coming up
We ready for whatever you put in front of us
Blood, sweat and tears...yeah
We dripped all three just to get here
No longer will I wake up and my dreams just vanish
It's staring right at me, I must take advantage
Hard work pays off, you get what you put in
So why stop now, gotta keep pushing
We in the fight 'til the finish, so why not fight 'til you're finished
Dig it, I'm a old author, here's my story
My life's been full of pain, now where's my glory (Ay!)

[Chorus]</pre>
