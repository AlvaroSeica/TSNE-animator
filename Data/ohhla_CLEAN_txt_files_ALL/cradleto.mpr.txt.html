[2Pac]
June 16, 1971
Mama gave birth
to a hell raisin' heavanly son
See the doctor tried to smack me
but I smacked him back
My first words were "thug for life"
and "Papa pass the Mac."
I'm bustin' on these mothafuckas ballin'
Listen you can hear my mini 14 callin'
From out the window of my drop top
I got my glock cocked
bustin' at niggas
when will it stop ?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes I see visions
And even with this thug livin'
will I escape in prison ?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance
and if you slang
Then you'd better have your nikes on
Cause when we fight
it's in the middle of the night with no lights on.
Hey!!
There must be a God cause I feel lucky
Paranoid out my mind
this mothafuckas tryin' to rush me
Am I goin' to jail?
Look at me bailin'
Commin' out the court house
all about my mail man
Never, never die
be a hustler motherfuckas
And makin' thugs out you suckas
From the cradle to the grave

[Chorus]
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto. easy
From the cardle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto

[Mopreme]
From the cradle to the grave
since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild
Pop pop!
just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark with less spark
Survalience on a nigga every day
Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away
Now Mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet
So now a young niggas bein' raised by the streets
And then the on other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
a straight thug
Just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gatts
one black and one of chrome
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got
so stop and walk a thin line
Young niggas be brave
and keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave

[Chorus]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin in the ghetto</pre>
