[will and friends singing, Obama speaking]
It was a creed, written into the founding documents
that declared the destiny, of a nation - yes we can
It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists
as they blazed a trail toward freedom - yes we can, yes we can
It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores
and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness - wes we can
It was the call of workers who organized
women who reached for the ballots
a President who chose the moon as our new frontier
and a King who took us to the mountaintop
and pointed the way to the Promised Land
Yes we can to justice, and equality

[Chorus: various artists]
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
Yes we can - ohhhh! We can... (Yes we can!)
Yes we can - ohhhh! We can...

[will and friends singing, Obama speaking]
Yes we can, to opportunity and prosperity
Yes we can, to opportunity and prosperity
Yes we can heal this nation (heal this nation!)
Yes we can repair this world (repair this world!)
Yes we can

[Chorus: various artists]
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
Yes we can - ohhhh! We can... (Yes we can!)
Yes we can - ohhhh! We can...
S?, se puede!

[will and friends singing, Obama speaking]
We know, the battle ahead will be long
But always remember that no matter what obstacles stand in our way
Nothing can stand, in the way of the power of millions of voices
calling for change
(WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE!)
(WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE!)
   We want change...we want change... we want change... I want change...
We have been told, we cannot do this
by a chorus of cynics; they will only grow louder and more dissonant
We've been asked, to pause for a reality check
We've been, warned against offering the people of this nation false hope
But in the unlikely story that is America
There has never been anything FALSE about hope
(WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE!)
(WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE!)
(WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE!)

[will and friends singing, Obama speaking]
Now the hopes, of the little girl who goes to a crumbling school in Dillon
are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of LA
We will remember that there is something happening in America
That we are not as divided as our politics suggests
That we are one people; we are one nation
And together, we will begin the next great chapter, in the American story
with three words that will ring from coast to coast
From sea to shining sea -- YES, WE, CAN

YES, WE, CAN {*repeat 8x*}

[will and friends singing to fade]
Yes we can, mmmhmmm.. ohhhhh, yes we can, yes we can
Oooooooooooooooh, yes we can</pre>
