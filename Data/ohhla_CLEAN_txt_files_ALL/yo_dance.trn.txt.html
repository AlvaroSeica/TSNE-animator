[Chorus: E-TRAIN]
Why you not dancing?
Why you not moving out of control?
I'm like what happened?
Did you forget that this is Yo Dance Floor?
Yo Dance Floor
Yo Dance Floor
Yo Yo Yo Dance Floor
Yo Dance Floor
Did you forget that this is Yo Dance Floor?
Yo Dance Floor
Yo Dance Floor
Yo Yo Yo Dance Floor
Yo Dance Floor

[Verse: E-TRAIN]
No need for intro I been dope
South side out to Glencoe, I pencil
Beat mixing with 8-Bit Nintendo
He kick in the street in his Enzo
Riding shades at night when I light up 
Diamond chains inside of the night club
I'm out of my mind but inside of
Every persons heart when I write stuff
3 years I been waiting and hating
Now I can repent for my patience
2 years I been making the greatest
Feelings, I put smiles on faces
Seeing just what momma made him
We can't stop I'm 'bout to take us
Higher and higher, so I'm asking....
