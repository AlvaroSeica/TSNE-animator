[Tay Zonday]
Allow me to introduce myself... my name is Tay
It's T-A-Y; T-A-Y to the Z
This is the web, and it's gonna murder your TV

It was, Chocolate Rainnnnn!
Wrote a song about that history
Chocolate Rainnnnn!
Now I'm paid a hefty hefty fee
Chocolate Rainnnnn!
Listen to the funky rhymes I weave
Chocolate Rainnnnn!
I move away from the mic to breathe

[Mista Johnson]
He moves his mouth away from the mic so he can breathe...
He moves his mouth away from the mic so he can breathe...

[Tay Zonday]
I wanna tell you about a love that took me by force
She hit my heart like a WILD red horse
I call her...

Cherry Chocolate Rainnnnn!
I open the door and see you standin there
Cherry Chocolate Rainnnnn!
Pull me in with that delicious stare
Cherry Chocolate Rainnnnn!
I need you right now, don't you want to stay
Cherry Chocolate Rainnnnn!
Your beauty burns me like a solar ray

[Mista Johnson]
Mista Johnson with Tay Zonday
Most downloaded video clips, most explosive video chicks
Makin big videos, with big city pros
Got mad witty flows, that get plenty dough ohhh~!
Make it pop cherry; whoa
Tick tock to the clock little berry flows
Ridiculous
Mista Johnson and Tay Zonday, sick with this

[Tay Zonday]
Cherry Chocolate Rainnnnn!
Release my love and unlock the chains
Cherry Chocolate Rainnnnn!
Your energy is coarsing through my veins
Cherry Chocolate Rainnnnn!
Ohio's agriculture's based on grains
Cherry Chocolate Rainnnnn!
My love will just never be the same
Dark, sweet, unexpected
Taste the secret, you're infected
Cure my body's deepest pains
Brought the thunder, made it rain

[Outro]
Ohhhh~! My Cherry Chocolate Rain, I love you
This internet thing is wild</pre>
