[chorus: Tray Deee]
If you spit game or flip thangs, insist to get paid
Keep it gangsta
In six-fo's wit thick hoes and thug in pimp mode
Gangsta, gangsta
If you stay strapped, drank 'yac, jack or slang sacks
Keep it gangsta
And all the hoes who wanna fuck 'cause they know what's up wit us
Gangsta, gangsta

[verse one: Livio]
Oh, I'm a gangsta livin' in these gangsta times
I want gangsta beats, I spit gangsta rhymes
Am I bout gettin' what's mine? My nigga, all the time
Some of us'll stay ahead, the rest'll fall behind
I'm on the grind, you kickin' short rhymes to Long Beach
Catch you on the wrong street, let you meet the concrete
I'm gettin' so annoyed, you'll get ya soul destroyed
Defeatin' me? You couldn't picture that wit a Polaroid
If Livio was a game, you still couldn't play me
I'd rather stay free, ride dirty wit Tray Deee
Niggas got so much money, they need to carry five wallets
While yours goes up and down like a pair of hydraulics
Niggas surround the mic, but they sound alike
I get 'em happy as a dildo that found a dyke
I leave 'em wit shattered domes, now I'll leave that alone
I don't know, dog, I couldn't call it if I had a phone

[chorus]

[verse two: Tray Deee]
You know how we do this, in the city, strictly of the truest
No doubt, locced out, niggas livin' foolish
Khaki suit the bluest and I bang the 'C'
Bad mothafucka, can't a busta hang wit me
I got the streets on lock, the heat on cock
The beats Crip-Hop, so the beefs don't stop
Fuck them other niggas that don't ride for real
Catch me behind the steel with a mind to kill
I conquer, my whole goal, control and prosper
While whitey want us locked up and known as monsters
To hold us hostage, but they can't stop this
The only outcome is a violent conflict
So I pledge allegiance to God and the Jesus
Forgive me for the illest nights of robbin' and thievin'
I pray I make it upstairs where I could thank ya
But understand that I been handlin' mines, a gangsta

[chorus]

[verse three: Livio]
Eh yo, pack ya shit up 'cause it's time to go
Livio kick a flow, make ya mind explode
You start wit us? I start to rush and turn ya heart to dust
None of you niggas is my dogs so you can't bark wit us
If you think life is rough, I'm a make the world harder
I'm quick to blacka! blacka! You get bombed like Pearl Harbor
I'm smarter than a college graduate from Harvard
Livio got more nuts than George Washington Carver
However far you took it, I'm sure I'm a take it farther
I got balls made of stones, so that proves that I'm harder
I'm comin' in the game and I'm benchin' you starters
Badger your witness and ask more questions than Barbara Walters
Getcha sunblock 'cause I'm sprayin' wit heat
I'm a slave to Funk Daddy when he's playin' the beat
We pickin' the hit, Livio is the quickest to spit
But I'm feelin' like an old toy, man, I'm sick of this shit
