"E'rybody want they trophy.
What is that supposed to tell me that you did somethin?
I don't need no God damn trophy or award or, recognition.
I do this shit cause I love to do this shit!
All these kids nowadays, all these - all these young people.
They gotta have some type of shiny material posession
or some shit that shows that they did somethin!
They gotta have a trophy, they gotta have an award.
They gotta have a nice lookin girl, and a
a nice car and some rims and a gold chain!
We don't need to know that you done some shit - just do it!
God damn trophies."</pre>
