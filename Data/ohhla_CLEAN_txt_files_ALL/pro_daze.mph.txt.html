[Verse 1]
As time keeps ticking I keep thinking
Alcoholics keep drinking, cocaine addicts keep sniffing
Paraplegics keep sitting
We keep committing, liars keep bullshitting
Wires keep singing till the sun ringing interrupts
Perhaps something corrupts
Your company goes bankrupt, cars are banked up
You're now in handcuffs pleading your innocence
Remain persistent, the future is not too distant
Although it's forever existing, someone played with the pistons
Fucking up your engine, cheating was tempting
I'm always rendering cause nothing goes perfectly to plan
Regrets of the grains of sand being wasted
Some things once broken, you just can't replace it
Positivity is so much better when tasted
So taste it, don't waste it

[Chorus] {X2}
My prerogative is to remain positive
I gotta live, gotta give, gotta get, gonna sweat
Wanna step? I'm on the left
I'm gonna do my best to progress, nothing short of, nothing less

[Verse 2]
Hot to trot, I take a partner for the progressive waltz
Some things you never know whether true or false
But don't let that bring you to a halt
A quick jolt, then left one, two
Right and we pursue, how do you do?
Don't let the passing flu limit you
It's all in the mind, find your body to be immune
Exit the tomb, avoid being marooned
In the world of the assumed
Soon you'll be doomed if you don't get in tune
You'll corrode like sand dunes
Instead bloom like a daisy, step from the shady
Hazy, I'm a Modern Man like Lazy
Since the days of being babies
We need to turn the maybes into the definite yes
Regret step with finesse
Obsess over things that you'd like
And as my initial fright enter the arena
With swift flight, the stage is alight
Act upon the likes tonight
Turn all those wrongs into the rights
And it'll be ok, and it'll be alright, right?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm becoming more and more advanced
The lyrical skills promoted enhanced
We all grow just like plants
And never stay in the exact same stance
We need to dance with destiny
Face the progressions standing next to me
I do it leisurely and move forward pleasantly
The necessity is to think positively
And with that migrate North, choose your course
Apply the required force, ride life like a horse
Yesterday's nobody can become today's superstar rhyme sayer
An average villager can become the town's dragon slayer
Layer upon layer, shit gets more flavour
We rise up when we say fuck those traitors
We're fresh now and we'll be even fresher later
As we cater for the underground banquets
You need to let go of the security blanket
Thank us and proceed
March forth and believe
Step forth and relieve
Now of course you must breathe</pre>
