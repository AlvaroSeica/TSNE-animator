On the mic, Boss Hogg Outlawz
PJ rap hustling, gotta ride for the cause
Big balls, in my Akademik jeans
Sipping drank blowing dank, popping trunk watching screens
Gotta be clean, when I step out on the scene
'Sacci shades taper fade, pockets full of that green
Haters looking at me mean, they must wanna see the beam
It's your boy P-Jizzle, I'm just repping for my team
Big badge on my neck, new Mavado on my wrist
All fake ass hoes, gotta X em off my list
The dro I'ma twist, purple drank I'ma po'
Fuck a cab riding slab, bout to slide in your hoe
Crawling slow down that 'Stead, might tip through that Ward
Make it back to Acres Home, gotta scoop one of my broads
Ain't no secret I'm a playa, till I die it's in my blood
Ain't no simping in my pimping, boo you fucking with a thug
I could never be a scrub, self esteem too major
Peepd you was a bopper, that's just how the streets made ya
Lied said I paid ya, mad cause I played ya
Now she hate my guts, cause the Hustler didn't save her
Sony disc changer, screens showing Fraiser
Cutting these hoes daily, game sharp as a razor
Pull up to the club, stepping out my fresh whip
I see all my ex bitches, but a playa don't trip
Might hit that M boy, maybe Club Dream
Maybe Vision, or late night at Breakers on the scene
After that I'm at that IHOP, or Denny's eating grub
Then it's straight to the room, time to tear that pussy up what</pre>
