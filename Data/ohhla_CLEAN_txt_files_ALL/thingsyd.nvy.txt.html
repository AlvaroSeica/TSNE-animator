[Intro: Nina Sky]
Oh-ho, oh-ho, ohhh... Nina Sky-y-ighhhh...

[Red Cafe]
DJ Envy, Red Cafe, The Co-op!

[Nina Sky  Chorus sung in the style of Gina Thompsons The Things That You Do]
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Verse 1: Red Cafe] (Nina Sky) (*Red Cafe in parenthesis)
Uh, you remind me of hard liquor
Feel like I overdosed on hard liquor
Now you got a G leanin (Jodeci)
You got a G Feenin woe is me
Is R Dot, the fresh and the flyest (Yeah)
The thighs in that dress could start a riot
(*UH OHH!!)Its the lovin like that
Like a round-trip flight, I be comin right back (Right back)
Shakedown got me thuggin like that (Like that)
All night, Im out chasin that trap
Its like every thugs dream
to have a down chick or a thug ass queen
Face in the pillow, ass in the arch
Legs done had a divorce, they split apart (Split apart)
I do it slow, til you scream (Do it faster)
Red Cafe, Im back the Trackmaster

[Chorus: Nina Sky] (Red Cafe)
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you (Yeah, It's The Co-op, OK OK!!!)
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you (What else! OK!!!)

[Verse 2: Red Cafe] (Nina Sky)(*Red Cafe in parenthesis)
It might be wrong but it feel so right, yes yes this is life
Love is so good you could bottle that stuff
If it wasn't Cafe I would gobble it up
Yep! No longer thinkin 'bout them R&amp;B girls
Like, Ciara (Uh Uh) Nivea (Who that?) Teairra (Nah) Olivia (Whatever!)
All them names seem trivia
You look mean in them painted paints, do that dance, do that dance
I ain't no backyard nigga
But my workout plan will make your backyard bigger
(*I like) To see you in my favorite jeans
(*And I like) The way you don't hold your scream
(*I like) The way you make your body rock
And you ain't scared to lick the lollipop

[Chorus: Nina Sky] 
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you 
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you 

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
OK! OK! I know ytou like the finer things
Designer names like Vera Wang
Necklesses and diamond rings
Bling blaow shirts with the shiney things
You could get all that plus a rover
Put my chain on the arm give you the cold shoulder
And the hood respect it man
I bring the pain that's the Method Man
What's  'gon top that? Who 'gon knock that?
We a tag team girl they can't stop that
The world feelin your fella, on the road to the riches let's get it together

[Verse 4: Nina Sky]
I see you sippin slowly (Slowly) I can tell you want me (You want me)
Like that drink so tasty, there's no need to be chasin, no no no

[Chorus: Nina Sky] 
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you 
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you 

[Outro: Nina Sky] (Red Cafe)
Uh huh, oh oh (Yeah! It's The Co-op!) Oh oh oh</pre>
