[Verse 1]
I hit the cherry harder, I'm very tarter
Every part of, my rhyme's fine like Sherry Carter
I have you know, no adversary's smarter
I'm not about the Glocks, but dress dapper
Lyrics will just tap ya knock your best rapper out the box
I bruise and batter crews and scatter
That used to chatter, to approve to the fools who's badder
I win of course, any friend of yours you send a cross
Leave 'em bloody like pads in the drawers for menopause
I'm dustin' niggas urgently need emergency surgery
Every word will leave third degree burns from combustion
When the P. show never get on before or after he flow
Amigo you know my steelo from wreckin' Stretch and Bobbito
Your shit is wack infertile
If your friend laugh he need a skin graft
I chew 'em in half just like a snappin' turtle
Put your crew to rest, lyrics go through your vest
Since you the best, so for you to test you must be on budda cess

(Chorus - repeat 3X)
I'm nowhere near simple - WHAT
My mental - CUT
Into - WHAT
Niggas like a Ginsu

I'm nowhere near simple, my mental

[Verse 2]
From the sound of it I'm comin' from the Boogie Down and shit
Where niggas are bound to flip on you if what you kick is conterfeit
Hustlin' and packin' steel actin' ill attack and kill
A person just snatchin' bills if they ain't got the rappin' skills
I knock hotties, rock block parties where people carry Glocks
Shotties to drop bodies when niggas got rowdy
Better renew your verse, your crew's the worst
Claimin' what they can to do Perce, so who's the first, what
Flows and thoughts perfect, I drop the hype shit
After I rock tonight watch the mic short circuit
Ya whole life ya, never
Heard a nigga more trifer or flow nicer than me, in no cypher
I'm like a wide screen showin' drama word to mama
When a rhyme I cause more trauma than a homicide scene
Forget cable, some kid ate who, me
My shit ?? since the time I used to rhyme and hit tables

(Chorus - repeat 3X)

I'm nowhere near simple, my mental

[Verse 3]
I got my rhyme trigger creepin', on niggas sleepin'
I'm with the deacon to bless the souls
Of rappers I hit this weekend at the winter beacon
Let's have a word, request a nurse
Niggas can't mess with Perce, or possess the worst shit ever heard
RÃ©sumÃ©, say I'm one of the best today
Want a display? I suggest you play, 'Yes You May'
That fat nigga flowin' on the tracks slicker
That rip the shit that make you rewind back quicker
Quote a rap figure, Percee P
Wanted for first degree, murder
Since ya heard it first from me, check it
Much props gettin' dough like corrupt cops and drug spots
Lyrics, let off buckshots in ya mug hops, keeps it real
Techniques are ill, deep with skill
Rappers reach for steel or wheels when they peep the grill

Yeah, y'all M.C.'s know the time when it comes to the Rhyme Inspector

(Chorus - repeat 3X)

I'm nowhere near simple, my mental</pre>
