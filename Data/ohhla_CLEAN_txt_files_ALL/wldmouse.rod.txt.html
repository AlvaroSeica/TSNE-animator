No smokin' alarms, no smokin' alarms
No smokin' alarms, no smokin' alarms
No smokin' alarms, no smokin' alarms
No smokin' alarms, no smokin' alarms
(I'm mind shockin', body rockin', earth shakin', money makin'
Sittin' high, lookin' fly, drinkin' on the best wine...)

[Li-Mouse]
Yeah, you fuckin' bitch, you played with my heart
Treated me like some cheap product from Kmart
I should of known you was playing me, just by your face
Thank God I ain't even let you stay in my place
You was always talking bout that dude from afar
Then I saw you smiling at him, when we was in the bar
You dumb ho, trying to see how far I would go
Like Jay said "zip zero, stingy with deniro"
Don't need Discovery shit, I got the 'deadliest catch'
You know I got the style, ain't no other dick can match
I should of slapped you, but Cno said 'chill'
Said 'do you really wanna go and pay for that bill?'
Save that for the mic, then we could go on strike
Bitch stunting on me, like Ruff Ryders on them bikes
I know what it was, maybe he had more dough
Or was it because I say 'dog', and he says 'bro'
Feels like you stomped me out, or killed my dog
Now you got me driving fast in an overcast fog
I said 'I love you', bitch, you said it back
But now I know, it really wasn't even like that
You lucky I ain't gon' say no names, you feel dumb
I should of fucked your couch up, for giggles and fun
Matter fact, I want my sweats back and my t-shirt
I should of burnt your pictures, yeah, now you'll be hurt
If I was you, my car would of been keyed
I was already bandaged up, now you made it bleed
Stupid ass whore, karma gonna come back hardcore
Just sit back and wait, the kind of shit that's in store
Bitch, respect that, hoe

[kung fu sample]
Brother, he's badly hurt, this is a throwing knife
You're right, not yet... get some water
Clean up these blood stains, alright?
And hurry!
Yes...</pre>
