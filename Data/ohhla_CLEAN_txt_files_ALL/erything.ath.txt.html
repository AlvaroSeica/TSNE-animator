[Atherton]
Introducing~!
Everything, you've been waiting for
The very thing that lately's made me stay indoors
The muzzled sound you heard comin out the basement floor
The first step in makin promoters pay me more
The worst bet holds the biggest payoff in sports
I'm at odds with every even thing your brain supports
When it rains it pours, I'm out with buckets and basins
Collectin every last drop until there's somethin to bathe in
Nothin is wasted, when the budget is basic
Keep runnin for placement amongst hundreds of faceless
Bubblin fake kids with redundant creations
And gluttonous agents with puppetry playlists
We've had enough of this makeshift huff &amp; puff on your tape biz
We're comin up, know somethin, us your new favorites
Face it, music you will soon grown fond of
For true hip-hop head to kids intimidated by the genre

[Chorus]
Everything, you've been waiting for (everything)
And everything in between
Everything, you've been waiting for (everything)
And everything in between

[Atherton]
Everything is here, six years of our lifes
From bum tracks and weak sessions we work the gears 'til it's right
From rough draft to re-edit to what you're hearin tonight
I love rap! This expression did not appear overnight
Ottawa light, a whole scene yearnin to prove
there's more to this than burnin spliffs and determine some booze
The chorus hits and nervous kids work into the groove
We're formin grids where torment has been a permanent truth
Runnin with kids who don't take the time to furnish their roof
We'll decorate the cityscapes, spraypaint burners in blue
I turn on the news, speak Olde English etiquette
Sire connects wires and shapes soundwave measurements
Treasure this like you're the guy who finally figured it out
Ottawa's dope and dedicated without a flicker of doubt
Either give in now or give up and get gone
Cause everything is what you're gettin 'til the minute that the shit's done

[Chorus] - repeat 2X sans last line

[new last line]
Atherton &amp; Sire, different way, same old thing</pre>
