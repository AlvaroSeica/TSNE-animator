Pre-Verse: Slow Pain
Get, get, get
Get it girl
You, my, my
Baby girl
You so fly
Pretty girl
You're always on my mind
Baby girl

[Slow Pain]
(Verse 1)
Five foot six, with a lovely face
Miss brown sugar, I seen on MySpace
Baby got back
Baby got front
Diamonds on her finger, pierce ring on her tongue
Streaks in her hair
Drink in her hand
Sexy Latina make me wanna be a man
Work hard all day
And play at night
Good job in the day
And party all night

Hook: Slow Pain
Just do what you came to do
Lil' mama
Do what you came to do
That's right
Do what you came to do
Lil' mama
Sh-sh-shake it to the left, sh-sh-shake it to the right

(Verse 2)
Real drink, girl
A beautiful thang
Body like a goddess, beautiful queen
Mexican, Columbian, Cuban and Rican
Baby girl's in the club every weekend

Chorus 1: Cousin Mario
You're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
Picked you up at the spot, girl, when you said to me
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh

(Verse 3)
Always on my mind
When I hit the spot (Yeah)
Girl, you're body's so
So hot
The way you walk to the bar, make lose my mind
So I opened up the bar, cause you so fine (So fly)
Drinks on me
Drinks on you
Coach purse with a heart tattoo (Tattoo)
It turns me on when you shake it like you do
Sh-sh-shake it like the house, mama, do what you do

Repeat Pre-Verse

Repeat Chorus 1

Chorus 2: Cousin Mario
You're the one that I want
You're the one that I need
Picked you up at the spot, girl, when you said to me
You're, my, favorite, girl
You're, my, favorite, girl
You're, my, favorite, girl
You're, my, favorite, girl

Repeat Hook

(Verse 4)
What's up, baby girl
Make up your mind
After hours
Your place or mine
It's 2 o'clock, am I waisting my time
Get low to the floor, drop, drop it on a dime

Repeat Pre-Verse

Repeat Chorus 1 &amp; 2

[Slow Pain]
E-Dubb
Take me to that gangsta trance
Cousin Mario on the track
Slow Pain
The O.G.
And I'm back</pre>
