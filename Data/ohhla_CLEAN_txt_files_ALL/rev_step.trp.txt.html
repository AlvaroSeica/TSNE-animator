Song:   Revolutionary Step
Typed by: hiphop@brassmail.com

Now let the troop introduce the latest dance
guaranteed to rip through your favourite pants
Originated by who? The ladies' man
Promoe rock the mike with a stable hand!
Forward ever, backward never
all my revolutionary steppers and wall wreckers
It takes a nation of million of cops to get us
Cosmic here to break up all the government set ups
Stay one step ahead - move your dancing feet
We gon' let the dead groove to this bouncin' beat
Already a smash hit cus it sound so sweet
already a classic cus it sound so street
Now you better blast this to stress the system
and you better flash this to impress the sistren
The hottest fashion, tonight in the club
Supreme's hated with a passion by the government thugs

[Chorus]
Do the revolutionary step
a dance you will never forget
Do the revolutionary step
step forward my sisters
Step forward
Do the revolutionary step
a dance you will never forget
Do the revolutionary step
Step forward brother...forward.

Now forget about poppin' pills, still
forget about standin' still, there's still a few hours till
they gon' close the place up, but who gives a fuck
Reclaim the streets tonight! Watch me how I step it up
Watch us how we steppin' out. Shake them shakers
Eliminate negativity, too late to hate us
Outrageous footwork. No more running man
Come on and celebrate cus we free and we love it man
This shit a blow up the system like it blows up your soundsystem
Move summthin'! Jump up and down twistin'
While cops twistin' your arm, pump your fist till you're warm
My people resisting with charm
Resistin' arrest, if you're pissed and oppressed
rely on Looptroop to put out hits to the death
You feel no pain when it hits in your chest
They might be blind now they wish they were deaf!

[Chorus]

Yo when our true fanbase do the new dance craze
we stomp and earthquake and shake the landscape
This giant step is like a smilin' threat
I see violent femmes looking wild and wet
and the style is fresh. Feel alive and blessed
My girls holdin' it down no matter how trife it gets
Yo, liberate yourself from mental entrapment
Keep'em both feet movin' and 'em hands clappin'
Traffic blocking - barricade the streets
Cops clockin' clockin' - when they hear us sing
But Looptroop rockin' - never face defeat
No stoppin' stoppin' - yo serious ting
You had enough? Then put your foot down, march and sing along
Show'em how the troop sounds when we 10 000 strong
It's a ten thousand miles long marathon
movin' out of Babylon and we're singin' this song

[Chorus]

forward fi ever!</pre>
