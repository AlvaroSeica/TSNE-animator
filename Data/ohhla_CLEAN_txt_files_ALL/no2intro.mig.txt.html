Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
You niggas be bitin' my style and I like it
But you niggas know you weren't rapping like this
Trend setter, I'm a trend setter
Knockin' them out like I'm Mayweather
Bando look like it's a homeless shelter
She poppin' that molly like Alka-Seltzer
Whippin' that dope with that terminator
Wrist is spillin' dope all on my Breitling bezel
My mansion got 80 acres
Trap underground, they calling me Undertaker
They wonder why I got the Bentley, the Fisker
I put in work and dedication
50 pairs, Giuseppe steppers
Maison Margiellas, they think I'm on Rocafella
The kid, they call me Slick Rick
I make up a script, they call me the storyteller
I got the Britney, the Whitney, the Iggy, we murdered Versace like Biggie
Fuck nigga we been in that Coogi, it's time to kill em' with Givenchy
Red bottoms, scenes are forensic
Designer frames, limited edition
Pushin' one button, my roof then is missing
Then put my Louboutin til' out the kitchen
You turn on the radio you gon' hear every rapper tryna rap like the Migos
Fuck nigga wanna clone?
Been rappin' like this since No Label
Fuck the fame rather be rich
Been gettin' money, since No Label
You waiting' for it, then here it go, intro to No Label

[DJ Ray G]
QC, It's funny my nigga right
Cause everybody wanna sound like us
But they don't wanna give us the respect, right?
You fuck niggas gon' learn we started this shit
We the first niggas to come out the A, on that real street shit
That real Northside shit, holdin' their muthafuckin' county down
Not city nigga, county nigga
Tell another nigga to do it like us, nigga
QC the label, money on the table
Migo Gang, No Label!

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Way back in the day nigga made No Label in a basement
Young nigga got all that talent
On the radio didn't have a placement
Linked up with the hood
OG Head Hancho, Migos
Then we took over the north
20 dollars to get your song played at Flamingos
Remember the days of hitting licks?
Every Christmas, had to be St. Nick
Payin' bills, tryna meet the rent
My mama she say that she sick of it
I had to go get to the Benjamin
Sorry Your Honor, I'm innocent
Money moves the commitment
No label, my life you witnessed it
From kickin' doors
Taking gold
What did I cash out on? I don't know
I will not tell on my soul
Cause Ion' know if the case closed
I know that you hate that Versace went gold
Now I'm walking round with a blue bankroll
Independent, never ever won't fold

[DJ Ray G]
See, I learnt the term from my nigga Biggie, right?
We went from ashy to classy
We went from having shit to fucking your bitch, my nigga
No Label, DJ Ray G
These my muthafucking brothers right here, Migo Gang
What niggas you know made a million in one summer without flipping bricks?
Ask your favorite rapper
I bet he say us, nigga
QC, the label
Hah! No Label!

[Verse 2: Offset]
Locked up on every mixtape
Quavo told me nigga wait
This is the only way we can escape
I realized it when I sat down for an 8
Grandma' told me and Quavo to be patient
Grandma' was a cancer patient
Before she died, she sat us down, said stay together and we're gonna make it
For you niggas don't know
Never really sold dope
But I kicked door
Free my nigga Willy, mane gave him to the dough
He didn't tell a soul
You making me sick to my stomach
I might go and vomit
You niggas is cloning
We not together cause you my opponent
Taking our style nigga we never loaned it
Labels wanna sign, that ain't on my mind
Critics and blogs, you know they ain't lying
Thirty thousand just to look at the time
Twenty five hundred for my Louboutin
Mansion Elan was our stomping ground
Our money big, your money minimized
Taking shots cause your buzz died
Cutting the top off the Lamb' make it circumcised
The world is fucked up but the strong survive

[DJ Ray G]
Haha, name your favourite club in Atlanta, my nigga
We ran that shit
We turned Mansion Elan
Into Migos Elan, nigga
We turned up sessions, in the Migos Playhouse nigga
Every strip club
Our main bitch, our side bitch, her side bitch, her side bitch worked there, nigga
We run this motherfuckin' city
We started new Atlanta
These niggas jackin' our swag, they better stand in line
And pay, bitch!</pre>
