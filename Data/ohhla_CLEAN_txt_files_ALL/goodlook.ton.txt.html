[Verse 1: The Tongue]
Hey yo second-hand flows like second-hand clothes
Both ain't worth shit like second-hand blow
I never rocked either at a show
And money is time so keep it moving like a second-hand bro
No, I never claimed to be pretty
Humble like the prostitutes working the johns of the city
Humble like a father of three, working three shifts
Back to back so the trio can eat
But in my life the hero is me
And before the credits roll the crowd needs something to see
You're a working bee on the smallest tree 
Thinking a working-class hero is something to be
See those destined for greatness, have no patience
We rise to the top like we were weightless
Fire off a heat-seeker, find ya playlist
Biters get burnt just trying to taste this
So spit your excuse out and make your mess
Your home ain't where your heart is - change address
We side-step the bullshit you just put your foot in
This is how you get good looking!

[Chorus]
Toy rappers with a mic? That's a bad look
Taking shots at Jimmy Nice? That's a bad look
Look - I'ma show you how you break this down
This is how you get good looking!
Twenty people at a show? That's a bad look
If your weed won't grow - that's a bad look
Look - I'ma show you how to break this down
This is how you get good looking!

[Verse 2: Nick Lupi]
It's Mr. Lup ah, you can trust I'm in the building
Came through looking like a million bucks
Do it for the children but, you know the deal
Say the wrong words man and you will get touched
We looking so good they couldn't believe it
Need a *bad education* they should've repeated
Rappers - I ain't seen their teeth since
We hit the streets like a league secret
No girls at your shows? That's a bad look
Booked acts a joke, promoters are mad crook
But as long as these drop-kicks are putting their hard-earned in
Week after week their insular world it keeps turning
The future's looking real pretty to the point that now they got no choice but to
deal with me
SS, Tongue, the illist in the city and we
Itching for a mirror cos we're feeling real spiffy!

[Chorus]
Clothes that don't fit? That's a bad look
Has-beens talking slick? That's a bad look
Look - I'ma show you how to break this down
This is how you get good looking!
Twenty people at a show? That's a bad look
If your weed won't grow - that's a bad look
Look - I'ma show you how to break this down
This is how you get good looking!

[Verse 3: Just Enuf]
Said I'm a every-day dog walking-player I got em gawking
Falling foe me, it's gotta be the smile 
The envy of toy rappers little boy fasion frauds
That lack authority and style and they cramping mine
ElefantTraks and SS tandem
We a handful of freshness, death-threats and ransom
Notes in the form of my raps, trying to buy back the look with the
*New school, new style, new rules*
I'm the Yves St Laurent of these breaks cool like a second hands these days
Over-sized shirts and pants thats not a good look - player please face it
Trying too hard's not a good look
Even if you're good looking or a good cook 
look at me for guidance - the nicest 
No more stripes - I'm freshjive
Syd City for life - We looking good!</pre>
