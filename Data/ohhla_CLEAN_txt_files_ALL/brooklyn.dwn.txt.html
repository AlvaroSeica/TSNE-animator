We got lost in Brooklyn
Yeah
Lost in Brooklyn
Where?
We got lost in Brooklyn
Yeah
Lost in Brooklyn
(You're in deep - the way things are lookin) --&gt; Dismasters

Now ah Brooklyn's known to rip a many a show
Have a many of foes, that's what we were told
The plot's in the south but the setting's in the north
I'ma cool out, clear the voice of course
Cool, clear your vocal
While I step down to the postal
And mail a postcard to my moms
Soon to drop bombs of mine
Hey yo yo Shawn, look at them girls in that ( ? )
(What is up with that southern twang? - I don't know)
Yeah we drink much tang and we swing some ding-a-ling
A snake in the grass, that's what I say
So we saddled up a hoochie coo'in on a Friday
8PM, it's two of them
It's two of us, we'll ride the bus without a fuss
This is ill, bro, there's a fat red brick in the pillow
She caught me, now I'm sleepy as a willow
Woke up in the morn, no money, no pants
In my drawers and my shirt
Damn, my head hurts
Simultaneously with an instant erection
There were two razors and a gat pointed in my man's direction
(..pants, all of that! Give it all up! All of it!)
Now ah what am I to do, cause she's the boss
But never sleep when you're lost in Brooklyn

We got lost in Brooklyn
Yeah
Lost in Brooklyn
Where?
We got lost in Brooklyn
Yeah
Who's lost in Brooklyn
(You're in deep - the way things are lookin) --&gt; Dismasters

Brooklyn, man, it's like another world, man, another planet, yo
I was totally lost, yo
I didn't know where to go, man
Got stuck up for my cash, yo, my money
These girls stuck me up

Been livin here a month and we been through some ill - shucks
The girl took my bucks
On the way down the block
We heard the chiddy-bang-bang-bang
Scatter
We laid like platters
And hit the decks
What's next?
A perfect description, fingerprints on the piece
A piece of Junior's Cheesecake?
Nah-nah, bro
Handcuffed upstate on skid row
Falsely accused, goin to Albee Square to buy shoes
The blues, now we on the news
Man, ya ain't livin large when you're tryina beat a murder charge
Yo, can I get one phone call, please?
Thank God for the acquittal
Now we in the brownstone in Brooklyn eatin vittles
And all of that stuff that goes with the flow
I know how to get lost in Brooklyn</pre>
