Song:   Tic Tac Toe
Typed by: obeseamerica

Going to hell in a hand basket with a casket of jewels
Fashion and fools? Surpass them with a passionate tool
Matter of fact these raps slap tracks and massacre troops
It's like cats make tracks and never practice them through
Man, I do this for the head nods and that tap of your shoe
Give me the finish line and I'll snap it in 2
What's happening dude is nothing but miraculous groove
That I inhabit, sticking and moving from flax to the loom
Contaminate with gamma rays and make it rapid and smooth
And my biggest critic is the last to approve
And unless I rock shows, there isn't cash in it duke
I dropped my pen on the floor and it splashed with a boom
The last of the few smashing up a passenger too
Too busy having fun to heed screeds babbling doom
Rose colored glass half full in a lavender room
Tossing a few asides to leave all the fragile consumed
And that's true

Tactile tic tac toe
Rap and flip lactose
Tackling the tracks dope
Half will win and that's so
Typical, and that's the way it has to be
So pass the keyand that's to me

You dig that? I'm a fan of the same
Remember Raekwons tarantula chain?
I kick raps that ramble and maim, the man is a train
Wreck set to trample parades with mandibles crazed
From analyst ways to stampedes the stamp of approval is gained
Turning it to a brand abandon all of the claims
Living day to day while you're balling away
You'll get a stomach ache from eating all of cake
And all that takes is time and moderation like Satchel
Lest the world becomes reason for the Paxil
Closing in walls, all frozen grim maws clenched
Arguing far through it start doing top tens
Giving them a soft serve, nerves misplaced
Tournament interns burn the stakes
Turning away enough to make Saint Peter's rack and pinion pivot
Imminent beginning to finish spin it all within a minute

Tactile tic tac toe
Rap and flip lactose
Tackling the tracks dope
Half will win and that's so
Typical, And that's the way it has to be
So pass the keyand that's to me

I'm not a candidate for polling holding candlesticks verboten
Hoping glamour is a potent potion, amorous and chosen
Open hands and get a token, never know it just might work
Instead of looking of the product, man I'm check the price first
And rectify verse until the words fit properly
Recording takes with a verb flipped sloppily
One of the benefits of having a studio at home
Is that you can't hear my mistakes when I roam
Each song's generation has different tweaks
Varied approaches to visiting beats
if it's wintertime, then I'm delivering heat
And if it's dinner, I'm in a different street
So listen to each and make your own call on the song
It is dope, or fresh, or wack, or something soft for your mom
I'm Sankofa, happily hopping along to the drums
The dinosaur rapping with a fossil, his tongue
And that's one</pre>
