[Mr. Lil One]
Everybody want to be knowing
How I be doing it when I be flowing
back up in this motherfucker
ready to server you motherfuckers
heard the words that be going around
coming to murder making no sound
the original, ready to go
leting 'em know, immediately
I'm fatal, better get up
shut up before I, slaughter all you bitches
you be knowing lil be flowing
while I'm all up in these bitches
We moving coming out grooving, motherfuckers you polluted
Yappin about a strap, but you never seem to shoot me

[Mr. Sancho]
????, taking it all
Lil and Sancho creep into the war
We're coming to beat it, you better belive it
I don't worry I just
I just buck 'em all
I'm coming up in, you think that I can't
Slaggin and rapping, receivin a grand
Strapped with a heat and the mic in my hand
Califa Thugs and the low pro gang
Blue raggin, all of the time
Banging these streets like I'm making my rhymes
thinking to pass for a long ass time
Until that I'm buzzin, taking your hyna and cuttin
Gonna bitch out with a dick in her mouth
and leavin her ass with nothin

[Mr. Lil One]
Now never you know
where the hoe want to go
act up on the low
would it be wrong
would it bocome
put tom up in a pond
commit this fucker murder
in this motherfucken song
memories of enemys
while I write these melodys
messeges you sending me
hopping that you'll remember me
let it be
what it is
still you can't fuck with this
stick and am making them break yall down

[Mr. Sancho]
holdin the cap of my gun
surrounded by copers
I'm settin to run out
am ownin your crew with my reputation
and we leavin you bitches shot up in the spot
but you canot compete
with the lil ones heat
I be doin the streets

steadaly, heavaly arrmed
to bust heat on this melody
bust heat for a felony
homie don't hate

cuz that LPG gang always lettin it work
putting these fu's like a myth in the dirt
living you hurt
homie you leave with a smurk
lovin burn with a bloody shirt

[Mr. Lil One]

the man will be ready
and wanting to scare
the ones who be talkin
pretending to stalkin
but never be doin

the way I be livin
the way I be givin a damn bout your ass
loving the way that I laugh

blow my mind one at a time
everyone thats shot at me

[Mr. Sancho]
