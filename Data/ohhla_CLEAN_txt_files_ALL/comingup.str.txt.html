[Intro: Christbearer]
Yeah... coming up, coming up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he coming up, she coming up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, coming up, coming up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he coming up, she coming up

[Chorus 2X: Christbearer]
He coming up, some way, some how
Blowing up like blaow, how you like me now?
She coming up, some way, some how
Blowing up like blaow, how you like me now?

[Christbearer]
He coming up, some way, some how
Fucking more young ho's than the law allow
A young nigga put doves on the Benz
You caught the homey shopping like he loves his friends
Just ease, as he makes it from the e's
Everytime I see the nigga, I'm like "where'd you get these?"
Florida Keys, shopping sprees
Killed 'em last summer with the Hummer on D's
I went to Roscoe's looking for a meal
Then ran into my niggas from the Killa Bee Kill
I'm like "my niggas, what's real?"
They said some niggas rolling deep in the Cadillac DeVille
They got ill? Caps got peeled
I think one of them niggas was your little nigga Will
Dope game got strained, I was like "he was your gang?"
They said major 'caine, and doing his thang
You know he put doves on the Benz, you didn't see the candy cane?

[Meko the Pharaoh]
Meko rock many, even when I didn't have a penny
Bitches through me many, I stay deep up in the trench, would flinch
Will get yo ass knocked out for trying to represent
Cuz where I lay, my niggas don't play
And the way they play, you might get spray
Like roaches, fucking with the deadly Northman
You end up like the headless horseman
How you like me now? Or like Destiny Child
Making bitches say "aow"
Meko keep cranking, until my pockets is fat
Nigga, who you like that?

[Chorus 2X]

[Christbearer]
I was, washing down the Expedition with the shany
When I first met Tammy, the shit was so uncanny
She said she just flew home with granny from Miami
And they moved around the corner on the coldest set cranny
She started ballin' out the gate, and she was pussy
Like weight, at a very low rate (wait, wait)
I said Tammy, how you get that cash?
You backin' that ass, while the red light flash
And Tammy said "no", pulled up in the Jaguar slow, yo, yo
About a week later, I was on the block
Her sister rolled up and told me Tammy got shot
I'm like damn, how the fuck Tammy get got...
Damn, said Tammy had a running with the cops
Tammy stole cars off the lot, Tammy kept it hot
Tammy was a have not, I'm like...

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
