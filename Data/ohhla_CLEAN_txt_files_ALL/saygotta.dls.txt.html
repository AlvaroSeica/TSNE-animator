(Double in background)
[Pos]  Let me hear you say "Alright"
[All]  ALRIGHT (Alright)
[Dove] Let me hear you say "Oh yeah"
[All]  OH YEAH
[Pos]  Now let me hear you say what you gonna do
[All]  WHAT YOU GONNA DO
[Dove] I need to hear you say you gotta believe
[All]  I GOTTA BELIEVE (Gotta believe)

(Verse 1)
[Pos]
It was all a dream that you felt before
You need to come on back, jack
Look who walked in the door
It's Parappa The Rapper, and my name is Pos
I'm known to emcee for free or a cause
If you be at the (???) church
Drop to your knees and pray for Parappa The Rapper
To save the day
And make you scream hooray
Just clappin' on time, cause it's time to play

[Double]
I know you're slick and smooth
Good with an attitude
On the right track
Later on the fact, think about
Never looking back
You know
My worth was satisfied
What I haven't know, deep inside of me
And all I need
Is my security

Break 1: Pos
When you need a foremission, he got your back
Sure to have a cool, man, that's a fact
Yo, he's a good friend, never ever a foe
So come on and let's go

(Verse 2)
[Dove]
We oughta concentrate in Vitamin D, with the title
Hookin' it up, speed quick, like noodles in cups
It ain't nothin' for the one man
Buttin' to move somethin'
Runnin' Parappa through laps
Huddlin' raps
And just when you thought your game was bad
Well, we got you cookin' out rhymes
All in your think ghetto
Proceed and click
The next level for fun, player
Play ya game
Player number one (One...)

[Double]
True love
That speaks the truth
You know it'll help me through
In the cold night
In the morning, all night
Or even in a fight
You know
You should come home to me
We could have fun
Until the morning light

[Verse 3: Pos]
It'll serve up a dish like Sunny Chan
You know I'm the man
Here to have fun
Wanna have a taste?
Here, have some
Servin' up O's by the oodles
Oh, I forgot
Parappa The Rapper, he don't like noodles
We like eating snapadash red
Freestyle from the top of the head
Yo, Parappa got skill
Why don't you give it try, see what you can build
Pacing life through that's pill
Watch your heels, you might slip and fall
And if you do, you know who to call (Who?)
It's Parappa The Rapper and De La, y'all

Bridge: Double
You, and me
Can walk, together
Until, the road
Forever
And so, I touch
The treasures of life
Everyday
Love, and hate
A face, to face it through
In fact, I got
Your back everyday
Uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh (Oh yeah, yay)

[Verse 4: Dove]
Watch you turn on your 36 inches
You in the boob tube, trapped deep
Til the game watch you sleep
(???) dosed on, moved, taught by the sensei
Your timing's all off, tiger
You in the little leagues, striking at a De La joint
Bunk a sessions for the plugs and pea data
Come train your camp, y'all
Mussolini, graffiti, tag and plug dose
Dose, dose, dose
Game over, I'm ghost, ghost, ghost

Break 2: Pos
When you need a foremission, he got your back
Sure to have a cool, man, that's a fact
Yo, he's a good friend, never ever a foe
Come on, everybody, sing along, let's go...

(Double in background)
[Pos]    All my peoples say "Alright"
[All]    ALRIGHT
[Dove]   Yeah, that was good
         Now let me hear you say "Oh yeah"
[All]    OH YEAH (Oh yeah)
[Pos]    Now let me hear you say what you gonna do
[All]    WHAT YOU GONNA DO
[Dove]   Come on, y'all
         I need to hear you say you gotta believe
[All]    I GOTTA BELIEVE (Gotta believe)
[Double] Oh yeah
         Oh yeah
         Oh yeah
         Oh yeah-i-yay</pre>
