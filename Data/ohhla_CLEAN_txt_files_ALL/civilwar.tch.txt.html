You know what? Fuck Dirty Harry (Immortal Technique)
We got guns too nigga~! (Killer Mike)

Fuck Rambo nigga! (Yeahhh)

[Immortal Technique]
The ghetto is like a prison ,with invisible bars
No matter where you at it always follows you where you are
And it's hard out there, for a pimp to get outta
But it's harder for the hooker that he beat the shit outta
I got, niggaz underground in the confederate states
Ironically runnin from slavery that prison creates
So I never hate on the South, I respect they vision
I just hate on niggaz that promote, Samboism
And white execs that, love to see us in that position
They reflect the stereotypes of America's vision
They want us dancin, coonin and hollerin
Only respect us, for playin sports and modelin
More than racism, it's stay-in-your-place-ism
Our people are trapped in practical black-face-ism
So fuck a civil war between the North and the South
It's between field niggaz and slaves that are stuck in the house

[Chorus: Chuck D]
Civil war, for the SOUL of our nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations, overthrowin the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war, for the SOUL of our nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Tryin to survive, cultural assassination

[Killer Mike]
Crip niggaz, Blood niggaz, Eses, Asians
Why the fuck we warrin with each other's population?
The devil want us dead, all our population
People in folk nation, why the separation
Why we got Jamaicans, hatin on Hatians
when the British and French raped both nations~?
Mexicans and Blacks kill each other, straight hatin
while the government profits from prison population
If you on the bottom be you Anglo or Asian
You gotta recognize the realness in what I'm sayin
You gotta recognize another G ain't the enemy
When the police ride, they kill us frequently
We gotta make the youth see, where the truth be
If you a G, then grow and develop G.D.
Fifty years of gangs and our people still poor
If we really run the streets, we should really end war

[Chorus]

[Brother Ali]
Listen~! our hearts were torn apart just like Yahweh's
Watchin towers full of souls fall to sawdust
Every time we called your office you ignored us
Now you holdin hearings on us all inside of Congress
Microscopes on us, ask if we're Jihadists
My answer was in line with all of the founding fathers
I think Patrick said it best, give me liberty or death
I shall never accept anything less
You claim innocence, you play victimless
but you gave the kiss of death in the name of self-defense
Slavery and theft of other nations to the end
to pacify your citizenry with excess
We believe in freedom, justice, security
But they're only good when applied universally
So certainly if I +Rage Against the Machine+
my aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
Heard you lead puttin fear inside your heart
Make you burn Qu'rans and tell me not to build a Mosque
Me my wife and babies we ain't never made Jihad
We just wanna touch our heads to the floor and talk to God
Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart
The greatest threat of harm doesn't come from any bomb
The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few
what happens when that few includes you? Civil war</pre>
