[Arlo Maverick]                                       
Some say the glory's gone, some say it's still there
Momma say we got stuck on our flags and our hair
Food and our music, clothes and our dances
Rebel without cause, bringing guns to a bashment
Accent down, proceed to act hard
But whens the last time you sen a barrel back a yard
Know very little, but know so much
Parents sacrifice, but we say so what
Money at disposal, shop till we drop
Swagger got us blinded but looks so hot
 Worst thing our parents ever did
Protect us from the hardships that they lived (we)
Take for granted our tools to lead (we)
Take for granted our parents can't read
But spend their last to make a college fund
How could we not have the grades when college comes?
  
[Chorus 2X - Saint]   
Swim Natty swim
But don't swallow no water
Swim Natty swim
But you mind the risk
  
[Dirt Gritie]     
From a distance we all look close 
Nodding our heads when we see black folks 
But up close ya'll be pulling the toast
Eager to provoke over who got the most
Most monies, most honeys, most clothes, most clout
Most jewellery and the latest ish out
When many times our parents went with out 
Sleep five to a bed in a two room house
And yet we act like we ashamed of their accomplishments 
Using words and slurs they tried abolishing
Telling the truth what is we acknowledging   
Looking to the future who is it we following 
Or, are we falling behind
Not using our minds in material times 
Blinded by psychological warfare 
As they use psychologically to increase marketing share
  
[Chorus 3X - Saint]   
Swim Natty swim
But don't swallow no water
Swim Natty swim
But you mind the risk 
  
[Saint]
I said momma work so hard
To give you food on the plate
Make sure that you clothed everyday
  
[Bigga Nolte]                       
They label me a criminal, I keep my cool
They confused, don't know why we pack tools
I came to this country to get stacks
School label me riff raff, I'm in the hood holding the big mack
They say the streets watching, I keep my eyes open
The system don't do it right, so I stop hoping
I stop moping, picked up guns to start coping 
You see me in the streets, hardcore I start doping
And I was slanging it all night
It started with the green and moved onto the white
It's not right, the way we treat life
But I live like those big boys live I want ice
And if they get it, I'm a get it
My dogs all hungry and I know that they wit it
They tried to pull me over and find keys in the whip
But you can't deport me, I got my citizenship
  
[Chorus 2X - Saint]   
Swim Natty swim
But don't swallow no water
Swim Natty swim
But you mind the risk</pre>
