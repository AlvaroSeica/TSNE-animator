Song:   Spend the Night
Typed by: Wammy Giveaway

Chorus: Layzie Bone
She said she wants to spend the night with me (Spend all night with me)
But it's too late
You did me wrong (You did me wrong)
She missed her chance to spend her life with me (Spend her life with me)
She paid me fake
A big mistake
I had to move on

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
Naw baby, ain't no next time, no guarantees, second chance
You playin' when it comes to them pants, and I'm a grown man
You sayin' you dishonest
When you started our relationship
Maybe you was groupied out
All up in my face and shit
Talkin' about my spaceship
Braggin' on your cudda
Grabbin' on my jewelery from Joshua to Jeweler
Maybach make you say that
You 'bout to get the payback
This is real, in living color, bitch, homey, don't play that
Tootles to you, poodles
That's how Layzie gon' do ya
Should've left you on the side of the curve, to eat doo-doo
Later for you, boo-boo
No stuntin' for your future
And if I ever see you again, I see through ya
Booyahkah, booyahkah
Games is for sissies
We put this on the table, tell all the lames, "Miss me?"
And you gon' miss me
Cause a nigga filthy
RICH, BITCH, spend the night, house empty

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Chale, tamale, now you ain't never gettin' a long stroke
You playin' hands, girl, I'm fuckin' with the grown folks
I keep my business on the low-low, fa' sho, though
You just a Wild Thing, old school Tone Loc's
So now you tardy to the party, and you wanna beg
Cause you heard about ya boy and it's early
You want it deep so you could scream, "Baby, baby, hurt me"
But hell naw, your nutty crazy ass don't deserve me
You out of time, out of line, out of damn touch
You know I'm (???) on the top notch, pretty much
You know it's nada to a boss with sauce
Regulate, candy paint with gloss
Now you can keep that, nana, little mama, I don't need that
I got another eight, one with a phat, weed sack
And she already on her way over
Sayonara, adios, nice to know ya

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
It's too late for "What's up," little baby girl was stuck up
Didn't recognize the Lay when I praise, I had no luck
Oh well, I'm a soldier
Me and Baby Bash rolled up
To the ball
For I buy the whole thang and get tow up
Post up and toast up
Hold 'em high for the vultures
Like desert heat, they quickly get thirsty and come approach us
We ain't no super soakers, what you thank, we jokers
Look at my face
I'm lookin' so serious like playing poker
Shortcut with a swoll butt, almost had me out of my hook up
I was just about to pour her a drink, until I looked up
Hold up, ain't you the one that wouldn't speak to me
Now you wanna drink with me
Oh, you wanna creep with me
Come be a freak with me
Small chances
I liked it when she put out her glass and start dancin'
This girl fancy, but I'm Bash
And I act like I was pouring a drink, and just splashed her

Repeat Chorus</pre>
