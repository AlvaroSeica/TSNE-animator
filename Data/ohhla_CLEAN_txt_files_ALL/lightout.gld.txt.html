Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Santigold]
Lights out, shoot up the station
TV's dead, where's there to run?
Watch everybody come undone
Lights out, we'll make it easy, we'll make it fun
Won't let them see now, how they had won
Still I wait another round

[Chorus]
Darling
Don't got to worry, you're locked in tight
Darling
Don't got to worry, turn out the light

[Santigold]
Wiped out, no concentration
They got us basking in the storm
I watch it as it loses form
I doubt that they could see me; that's what I want
A casualty but, I am upfront
And, I, know what it's about

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
I'm still a-shakin my head
The one you can't account for
I keep just one step ahead
There's no place to run

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
Aah ah ah ah ah...

[Chorus 2X]

[Santigold]
Aah aah ah ah ah ah... </pre>
