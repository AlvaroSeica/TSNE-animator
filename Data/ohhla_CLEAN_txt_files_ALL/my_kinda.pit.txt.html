[Intro: Pitbull]
My girl is the kind of girl that walks in a room (Mr. Worldwide)
Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool (Nelly)
My girl is what these other girls wanna be {*speaking Spanish*}
{*porto el mundo*} but that's why she's with me, my kind of girl

[Chorus: Nelly]
She look like my kind of girl
She walk like my kind of girl
She talk like my kind of girl
I guess my kind of girl is you
So I think I better
Get in line, get in line, get in line, no
Get in line, get in line, get in line, yeah!
Get in line, get in line
Yeah cause every nigga in here want you

[Pitbull]
You name it, she's got it, cheatin realistic about it
Disrespectin, act a fool in public, I doubt it
If there's skeletons in a closet, that's where she keeps 'em
I do business with sharks, so she stays quiet and peeps 'em
Even if she's threatened with time for secrets she keeps 'em
Never goes through what's mine, she respects the grind
I respect her mind, that's why I made her mine
For me she'll fight the world, now that's my kind of girl

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
My kind of girl, yeah, she's got a vision
That's food for thought now let them haters do the dishes
A pair of tall heels and her stockings fishnets
And I ain't talking fishin, she's got a sixth sense
Green paper with that big pull nah man, it don't impress her
She'll break a full court, so watch how you press her
She came from nothin so she knows some'n, yeah that's true
For me she'll fight the world, now that's my kind of girl

[Chorus]

[Pitbull + Nelly]
My girl is the kind of girl that walks in a room
Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool
My girl is what these other girls wanna be
but that's why she's with me, my kind of girl
Sometimes she bougie, sometimes she hood
But she my down ass bitch, that's understood
And when she with me (yeah) she know she good
Yup she my down ass bitch... oooh~!

[Chorus]</pre>
