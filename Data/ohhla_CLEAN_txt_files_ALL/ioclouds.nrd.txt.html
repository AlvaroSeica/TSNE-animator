[Pharrell]
I can smell them when I go outside (outside)
Then it just pours
It gives us peace then all in the town is quiet (outside)
That's what, rain's for

All the kids see rain and scream oh no
Run off the bus and they would just stay in
Me I love how rain fills the potholes
Me and myself well that's what we played in
Ever wonder exactly where the sun goes
Did it go or did something shade it?
The sun gives light cause it is the one though
Rain gives life cause it is amazing

The rain inside of clouds {*2X*}
Coming from the sky, proves there's life</pre>
