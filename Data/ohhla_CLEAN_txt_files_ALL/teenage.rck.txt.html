(Chorus: repeat 4x)
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again

[Verse One]
Aye sport, here's a thought from the old school crew
A serious situation we all go threw
It deals wit your feelins, so here what I say
It's like a dyke, but nothing seems to go your way
Bust this, two people, they really like each other
He says their's no one else
And she claims they're is no other
The feelins are same, and you receive a notion
To reveal your inner thoughts deeply hit emotions

(Chorus:4x)

[Verse Two]
Precious times, hopin they won't end
Tell your mother bout your lover
Or so your best friend
Ya mighty proud while your holdin her hand
Boys, yo that's my woman, and girls, yeah that's my man
This pressure brings a sort of warmth to ya heart
And everything seems so great at the start
For she loves him, and he also loves her
And it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
But later on, problems start to occur
And the bond, which combines, y'all turn into a blur
For the feelins were the same, now here's the score
You love him to much, and they don't love him anymore
Or did you have to choose a number
Or because your not bein true
Or maybe they're just plain sick of seein you
Word, now it might seem strange
You better take his quick, and make the right change

(Chorus: 4x)

[Verse Three]
See just when you swore, the boy was wrong and
Then they're gone, and part of ya heart's been stolen
Get back on your feet, wit a hop and a skip
But no, you rather go wit this dead relationship
Hangin around, and buyin him stuff
You seem him every darn day, you don't see him enough
You follow them around, and they claim ya hawkin
When conversation comes, you do all the talkin
Not to mention, attention, we all need a bit
Behind ya back they're sayin, yeah he's all on my tits
They're gettin sick of you, and quite annoyed
And if you had plans for the future, they're now destroyed
You saw what was happenin, and you still let it
And if you ever let him  make love to ya girl, you can forget it
Sweetheart, you been caught, spread around town
Passin then ya thoughts
And break up time, and your recitine the words
Yo this is fromt the heart, and I know the part hearts
Get over it, from now don't take short slick
If it's not true love, you shouldn't deal wit it
Just think of your future, and what is to come
And pay attention to the words that's in this song, they go

(Chorus: 4x)

Do you know, where ya goin to
Do like the things that life is showin you
And are you going to...</pre>
