Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I want everybody to stop what they're doing
Now if you know you're with somebody
you're gonna take the hotel room tonight, make some noise..
Meet me at the hotel room [x4]

Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room
you can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the hotel room [x2]
We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn [x4]

She like that freaky stuff
2 and the O, 1 in the eye
That kinkee stuff, you nasty
But I like your type
And like T.I. it's whatever you like
Bring your girls
It's whatever tonight
Your man just left
I'm the plumber tonight
Let me check your pipes
Oh, you're the healthy type
Well, here goes some egg whites
Now gimme that sweet, that nasty gooshy stuff
Let me tell you what we gon' do
2 + 2, I'm gonna undress you
Then we're gonna go 3 and 3 you gon' undress me
Then we're gon' go 4 and 4
We gon' freak some more, but first!

Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room
you can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the hotel room [x2]
We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn [x4]

After party in hotel lobby
Then we off to the room like voom
With them fingers in yo mouth or open up yo blouse
And pull that g-sting down south (ouhh)
OK shawty, 1's company, 2's a crowd, and 3's a party
If your girl ain't with it, I got somebody
And by nature she's naughty
Now gimme that sweet, that nasty gooshy stuff
Ima tell you what we gon' do
2 + 2, I'm gon' undress you
Then we gon' go 3 and 3, you gon' undress me
Then we gonna go 4 and 4, we gon' freak some more! But first..

Forget about your boyfriend and meet me at the hotel room
you can bring your girlfriends and meet me at the hotel room [x2]
We at the hotel, motel, holiday inn [x4]</pre>
