[Chorus 1.5x: 12th Disciple]
I walk thru the Valley of Death alone
And I fear no evil

[Prodigal Sunn]
Well I accumulate, stimulate, circulates thru the days of the insane
Generating thru veins, absorbin acid rain
Planets flee when I proceed, it's order, cause to damage
ya diamater of life, time and matter
Crucifier of evil desires, I lock all empires, is all fire
Beware of the soul cypher, the last impression armageddon
The day of the Devil's oppressin, 
begins an end in our murder session
The mind'll travel, benjamins never the disciples
controller of the world
We takin ya ass thru another cycle

[?]
I create havoc, like a lunatic
Cuttin to the quick with my fuckin icepick
Ya souls I evict, ya presense is restricted because ya
click with conflict
With the injuries I inflicted
The wicked I predicted got convicted for domestic violence
So I put his hideous ass to silence
Forever shall he lay to rest in piece, and there he remain deceased
In the belly of the beast
Just to leave Abyss, in evaporated mystery is ceased
I bring forth a new Holocaust
Death tolls by the cross, niggas took a loss
You can't escape this fatal epidemic
It's a sickness, scientists can't fix this

[Hell Razah]
Sunz of Man rule, run thru them conscious like constituti'
Introducin the Hell Raz' the dead brain
That's polluted and Dark Knight we be the Lord shining light
Like the sun forgotten demons better remember
And drop ya guns, I get in ya head like the mind ya don't use
911, call all the devils, the wack rhymes we abuse
Surprise, we come to tell the truth about ya lies
Multiplied by many ways, chase the devils back to the cave
I praise a Swarm within my mouth
And swing the one in my hand
Absorb the blood, to avoid fake judges

[Killah Priest]
Enter the zone of the seven
I brake up ya chemistry and throw ya bones into heaven
You couldn't stop it, not even if you took a rocket
Wanna see more?
I drag ya ass down below the see floor
And watch ya burn up like lee saw
The next show you be doin is around the rainbow
Or with Hannibal, a caveman or some cannibals
And once ya brain burst, I bury you under the moons dirt
I drag ya remains over Jupiter's turf
And teach a lesson, till I reach perfection
Come down upon dick heads like yeast infection

[12th Disciple]
My thoughts will leak when the speak
I can make blood leak
And pound Dracula's with the beeker
I'm freezin niggas in this fuckin trap like task force
When I talk I blow out all the light in New York
So light the 7 candles, comin thru the desert on a camel
With light holy sandles, speakin the gospel
It's the Holy Apostle, 12th Disciple
Flip on the scripture, from the fuckin Bible, 
was a sin for a man
That's heart'll bleed Holy, 
I look him in his eyes and watch him die slowly
Sun of Man, I am that I am, seed of Abraham

[60 Second Assassin]
Master Allah, king of cry babies, ruler now for the scholar
Master M.A. Allah, take ya beyond, equals ?
Just like I told ya, I take ya, thru vapors
Stratmosphere, Troposphere, Hemisphere, currents
And Heaven's little nigga, you should of been it in me
I have a code name, better known as 60 Second Assassinator
Arsonator, the cremator, the freestyle
Evaporate like sand in the mini glass 
that likes to give it a taker
A breath could death, this quietly at ya doorstep
'sept wasn't ready in the art of war for rep'
I been vet det, contest, breathe a fist, architect
Frenchmen mastermind a step, black interior deck

[?]
Thoughts interfere with devil mirrorin
Now we even steamin, because the devil is no longer vearin
Leavin my body into ya body, so you can see what I'm seein
Not a hell in my bodies limb
Now ya aggreeing that tongue is laced with acid
Stick my white fingers up in your face, 
ya scream like meltin plastic
Stretch ya body put a slug in ya red basket
Talk you can respect by drinkin Christ blood from the casket
Everything I touch combusts, desintegrates into dust
Livin up my nose, boy rush, bring ya fam' not a friend
Seven signs, not seven hymns
From enterin, give him lacerations from his penis to his chin
With seven pages from the book of Labedicus
And seven shots from the back to kill 
seven men with the devil's grin
Lord have mercy, forgive me for the 5 sins

[Zodiac Killah]
Conceide this, the White Jesus
You invision, in prison
And ya own force religion, Die to ya lies, tangle, strangle
Die Devil Die, I watch ya corpse dangle
In my noose, AH-CHOO!
I learned how to tie when I was young
Decapitate ya head with the force of my tongue
To deny ya return, burn Devil burn in the flame
This Killah plays no games

*60 Sec. awws to fade*

Chorus 3x

[12th Disciple]
Here now '95
Sunz of Man, Population Click Click
Keepin shit real, for the hip hop era
Comin at ya, live with the facts
Let us make man our own image and our own likeness
Straight to the burnin bush
12th Disciple, eatin last supper, what's upper?
Fear no evil, See no evil
yeah yeah</pre>
