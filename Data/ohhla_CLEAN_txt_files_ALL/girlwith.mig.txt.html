Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Those innocent eyes (eyes)
That smile on your face makes it easy to trust you
If they only knew, the girl with the tattoo, like I do
Doin' what you doin' just to get you where you goin', yeah I see, baby
Just don't lose yourself along the way, no
Cus your doin' what you doin' just to get you where your goin' and I see it baby
And too many others gon' ask to say I do
but I knew ...the girl with the tattoo, yeah
oh yeah I knew, the girl with the tattoo
I use to know</pre>
