Make you believe, I can tell you lots a' things that'll make you believe
Make you believe, I can tell you lots a' things that'll make you believe
Make you believe, I can tell you lots a' things that'll make you believe
Make you believe, I can tell you lots a' things that'll make you believe

1st Verse (Trek Life)

My intuition sayin its time to get it
My mind's indifferent to this industries blinded vision
My intention to raise the status quo of this rap shit
And give it back to the street origin that brought it to fruition
I'ma long distance from where I'm headed but well equipped for the journey though
Rhymes written concernin those
Who writin flows for they first time
Spittin they fist line just
Locate you timing and focus you mind
It's all conversation
Being wacks an abomination to the masses that created this art
I'm from LA where niggas is fightin for blocks that they do not own damn
I'm not a gangsta I'm a grown man
And there's a difference
Raised by hardworkers and killers
Scholars and drug dealers
Sisters who burn niggas
Preachers who learn scriptures but, now I see
It's only me that can define me the T-R-E

2nd Verse (Trek Life)

Far as rap I'm necessary but over looked like Langston Hughes first written words
Or Snoop Dogg's first hit of Herb
Other words
I rep the beginning up in this bitch
Its like
All major things start from minor events
So here's my first installment at greatness ya'll
All of you makeshift artist step to the side, move
I'm like the soul in Savian Glover's taps shoes
You see my raps are the sound within the movement
My words are like music on top of music
That's why you feel it even when it's acapella
Don't even bail up if you not developed man I'm tryin to tell ya
Forreal all-a yall just get yo mail up
And fuck, What niggas yellin' do you
Here's what I tell me, I'm me
Regard of who you think I'm supposed to be
Stop guessin
Only those who know are those close to me
They lied ya'll
Don't look in the skies ya'll
Just close you eyes focus inside to find God

(Chorus) (Olivier Daysoul)
Seasons change reasons change baby (As the World Turns)
Not a thang stays the same baby (As the World Turns)
Every player plays the game baby
Because you live and you learn
You spend and you earn
And that's just day to day

3rd Verse (Trek Life)

Shit'll be over when a nigga reach his zenith
Fuckin hoes a nigga prolly need to try and be wit
But I don't see it til they screamin I don't need this
Napolean Conplex I rarely show weekness
That prolly haunt me later
For now I'm tossin major hits like Eric Gagne
Prolly think my wildpitch is my dog
Check my change up
Arrange a verse and a track like a shotgun weddin'
I make it happen
You other cats are not real ready
Acquire basics
These raps are niggas who tryin to make it @ anything
Mothers who watching they suns prayin
Knowing bars is in they future
16's, the county or exams
Momma trust em let a man be a man
The worlds turns

(Chorus) (Olivier Daysoul)
Seasons change reasons change baby (As the World Turns)
Not a thang stays the same baby (As the World Turns)
Every player plays the game baby
Because you live and you learn
You spend and you earn
And that's just day to day</pre>
