[David Banner]
Everybody wanna rap but y'all don't seem sincere
Do you realize the pain goin on round here?
Think about the things that we puttin in these kids ear
Is parallel to slave stories told by Ma Dear
I'm a man with a plan since fifteen on the corner
With some beats in my hand all rapped in Saran
Sellin gettin cash, stacks, wrapped, smacked in rubber bands
I was just like you, little nigga skippin school
Smokin weed tryin to fuck something
Then I had to move
Yeah God made me choose, the dope game, rap, or school
Cause it's all fucked up
That's word to my name, now we all Screwed up
Bitches poppin pills Now they all juiced up
Black women raise your kids
Cause we don't need a lil nigga in the pen dodgin dick
And I know it sounds six six six
Oil spills on the coast but BP STILL RICH
Man them white folk ain't goin trip
Katrina, now this, they tryin to break our spirits

The devil in the form of a lick
But niggaz wannt rap, play sports and chop bricks {*3X*}

This is David Banner's Mississippi country grammar
I'm sick of all my niggaz praisin livin in slammers
Board up your window neighbor, and save that peace shit for the pope
Cause there's a war goin on, and its all about dope
The rich is gettin richer and the poor is gettin broke
Meanwhile niggaz hatin on my twenty-two spokes
On my caddy I eyed Cali cause I had to have more
Then a Pyrex visit, tryin to flip a little coke
Yeah I love black folks
We gotta do more than smoke
I got a flow like Muhammad when you up against the ropes
Every verse from now on is a motherfuckin quote
For you fuk ass rappers, bendin over for the soap
Yellin pause grand dad, NO NO
Star bitches in the crowd like I'm Tony Romo
I got a heart like a pit
Got beats like a pimp
I'm a man amongst women, let y'all play the bitch
Got Boo on deck and too BIG K.r.i.t
Still articulatin words with our southern accent
Biitch; it's the mixtape son my nigga
