[Verse One: Threat]
Tick, tock, you don't, stop
My rhymes got 'em strung like dope, rocks
And now I got a fat enough wallet
To buy a cowboy the {?} plus his dog Spot
Huh, watch it as I drop it
Atomic bomb is better known as the chronic
For ninety-one and ninety-two, I'ma serve
I've got somethin for Officer Bird, see
Ain't no way y'all gon' have me in the mall with no VIN check
Wishin with my hands on the glass like Windex
I gotta have it like a rabbit
So the first bitch that walk up get tossed up like a salad
Tell 'em Bob (what?) you know how we do it loc'
Break they bedpost then get ghost (yeap)
Check they pulse (riight)
And if they pass out, they just ass out

[Verse Two: Threat]
So just stay off my dick nigga
And tell yo' bitch that I wanna put this in her
Strip her ass butt-naked like paint thinner
Cause a nigga ain't nothin but a chicken dinner
So if you got a bitch that try to just play you like a video game
Tell 'em any old thang, yeah
Cause now I got riches, bitches
be knockin on my door like Jehovah Witness, for instance
This one particular hoe.. hum
With her big ol' nigga lookin like Lou Ferrigno
The nigga's pissed off, it's his fault
If he wasn't on my dick he wouldn'ta noticed her lip gloss
Who got an instant replay, he say
niggaz hoppin on and off the bitch like a freeway {*horn*}
She kept her mouth down South..
.. on my fly, kiss her ass goodbye

[Verse Three: Threat]
If it's a bitch what, a one-eighty-seven
Stuck for the homies my ass, and you can tell 'em
Two choices - either the police get'cha
Or the next door neighbor's doberman pinscher
And fuck around, ass be to' up
Lookin like a plain-ass donut
I shoulda known when I was told it was niggaz in a Brougham
holdin walkie-talkie microphones
Why me, a nigga gotta stay sucka free
Jake can't fuck with me
Surround the whole block, a helicopter never stopped a fox
Especially if he's sly
But if you ain't fly
Kiss yo' ass goodbye..
So kiss your ass goodbye
