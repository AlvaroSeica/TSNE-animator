{the first 48 seconds are instrumental}

[Zack de la Rocha]
FLIP this capital eclipse
The vocal tone has got 'em sweatin their own apocalypse
Yes, rebel of the grains stand masterless
The masked ones cap one, NAFTA comin with the new disaster
And yes we in with the wind and the Plan de Ayala kin 
comin back around again
The slave driver saliva, one night power turns
Them devils mouths dry, now Mexico burns
So here they come, one by one them killers of the new frontier
Occupy, causin fear, come on...

With the wind below!

We in with the wind below!

With the wind below! 

FLIP this capital eclipse
Them bury life wit IMF shifts, and poison lips
Yo they talk it, while slicin our veins, yo so mark it
From the FINCAS overseers, to them vultures playin markets
She ain't got nothin but weapon and shawl
She is Chol, Tzotzil, Tojolobal, Tzeltal
The tools are her tools, Ejidos and ovaries
She once struggled, now through a barrel she breathes

She is the wind below!

The wind below!

She is the wind below!

{instrumental break w/ creepy riffs}

And all the shareholders gonna flex, and try to annex the truth...
While the new trust is gonna flex, and cast their image in you...
Yeah, all the shareholders gonna flex, and try to annex the truth...
And while the new trust tries to flex, and cast their image in you...
And GE is gonna flex and try and annex the truth...
And NBC is gonna flex and cast their image in you..
And Disney bought the fantasies and piles of eyes..
And ABC's new thrill rides, of trials and lies..
And while the gut eaters strain to pull the mud from their mouths...
They force our ears to go deaf to the screams in the south. - YEAH!

BUT WE IN WITH THE WIND BELOW!!!

BUT WE IN WITH THE WIND BELOW!!!
