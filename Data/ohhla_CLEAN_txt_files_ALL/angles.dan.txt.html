Things in life ain't always quite what they seem
there's more than one given angle to any one given scene
So bear that in mind next time you try to intervene
on any one given angle, on any one given scene

[MARK]
My name is mark &amp; I go to Uni &amp; college
Don't socialise that much I just revise &amp; build knowledge
At times I find that I become a virtual recluse
I let my belt of interaction hang decisively loose
But I came here to learn and that's the life that I choose
So if people think that I'm a geek they can bring their abuse
See a lot of people think that I'm boring and say
That maybe I'm a weirdo or maybe I'm gay
But I don't care coz when I get a good job &amp; good pay
I'll get a house for just my brother and me some day
And that's the reason I'm here, just to build for the future
And if it means better grades yeah I'd even sleep with my tutor
Things in life ain't always quite what they seem
there's more than one given angle to any one given scene
So bear that in mind next time you try to intervene
on any one given angle, on any one given scene

[PAUL]
My name is Paul &amp; I've been a guard for 6 months
The shop that I guard is better than most dumps
That's why I like it here &amp; my boss he's a pro
He's taught me tricks of the trade that other guards wouldn't know
I've learnt that in this game, there's some rules, you gotta bend
And not to forget these thieving pricks ain't your friend
And that appearance is key coz there's a message to send
And above all of that it's your fellow guards you defend
The other day my boss was stabbed by some lowlife psycho
He's in hospital now so every night that's where I go
He's on the brink right now but he's showing no fear though
Coz if he dies there in bed he knows he's dying a hero
Things in life ain't always quite what they seem
there's more than one given angle to any one given scene
So bear that in mind next time you try to intervene
on any one given angle, on any one given scene

[KEITH]
My name is Keith and I ain't so much a racist
But if one reached out a hand I'd decline their embraces
I work security in a shop in charge of 5 other guards
And I've got all of their respect coz I run this shit hard
I nicked one thief today; he didn't show enough respect &amp; attention
So I grabbed him by the neck, see that's my form of redemption
I do no real harm; just make sure that it hurts
It ain't going by the book but believe me it works
Then I sent him on his way, that little shit knows the score now
Instil a little bit of fear. He won't darken my door now
And that's what I do. Stop these kids from decline
Do what their parents wouldn't do, put down some boundaries &amp; lines
Things in life ain't always quite what they seem
there's more than one given angle to any one given scene
So bear that in mind next time you try to intervene
on any one given angle, on any one given scene

[BILLY]
My name is Billy &amp; I've been beaten since I was 3
Mum died when I was born and dad takes it out on me
He ain't a bad man. He just gets drunk &amp; feels alone
I tend to go for a walk, hope he's asleep when I get home
I don't like to talk about it much coz like I said it ain't his fault
It only happens when he's drunk as a last resort
I wanted to get him a gift to show my support
But I had no money so I stole &amp; I guess I got caught
At times like that I kinda switch of my mind
Stare blankly into space and let what happens unwind
That seemed to anger this guard, he put his hands round my neck
He said it's time for me to learn some manners &amp; respect
It hurt, but I've had worse before
But it made me realise life was just a series of wars
I went straight home that day and locked the bathroom door
Took a blade to both wrists, they won't hurt me no more
Things in life ain't always quite what they seem
there's more than one given angle to any one given scene
So bear that in mind next time you try to intervene
on any one given angle, on any one given scene

[MARK]
My name is Mark and today I was told my brother was dead
I returned from Uni and burst into tears on his bed
Under his pillow, I found his suicide note &amp; I read
What had happened that day &amp; what had fucked up his head
The anger I felt right then there no words to express
I filled up with so much rage there was no way to digest
I grabbed a knife &amp; walked to town, it was time to regress
Back to an eye for and eye, last breath for last breath
I went straight up to the counter &amp; said I'd like to speak
To the guard that nicked my brother on Tuesday of this week
As the girl went through a door &amp; disappeared out of sight
I put my hand in my pocket and I gripped the knife tight
This was it, as she pointed me out to the guard
My hand began to shake as held the knife so hard
Then as he approached me there was nothing to say
I stabbed that fucker eight times before they could take me away
Things in life ain't always quite what they seem
there's more than one given angle to any one given scene
So bear that in mind next time you try to intervene
on any one given angle, on any one given scene</pre>
