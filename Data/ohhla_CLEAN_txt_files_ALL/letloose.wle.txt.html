[Intro] [Wale talking]
Yeah. See I ain't tryin' to waste your time shorty
I know you got places to go. But I got places to be
I only need like three minutes of your time
I don't know what those other bammers need but...let me rap to you
What's up

[Chorus 1] [Pharrell]
All the girls really want is fun
Just a place that they can come
So their wild side has the freedom to run
And last but not least please don't tell no one

[Verse One] [Wale]
I just wanna treat you like the woman that you need to be
I be on that Peter Pan in NYC
You needin me? Then hit me
Commitment? No not really
And shorty don't be silly we not trippin' off your history
This a one nighter
And a bitch when she fight 'em
And some liquor will light her
If its no I.D. adios got no interest in minors
I'm on my grown man B.I. 
You see why?
Cause these lil' broads think it's not alright to be bi
I'm messin' with ya, you comfortable with it never mind
You never play with young boys cause they never private
And they forever out you, that's why you always quiet
The only one that's not Patronin', designate your drivin'
Okay just loosen up a little
That Nuvo or that Goose will have you losin' your religion amen
They say you only live once so go to work for what you need
But I'ma give you what you want

[Chorus 1] [Pharrell]
All the girls really want is fun
Just a place that they can come
So their wild side has the freedom to run
And last but not least please don't tell no one

[Chorus 2] [Pharrell]

[Verse Two] [Wale]

Throw your money in the air and stand in the couch
Laugh at the money that's stuck in the chandelier
Tell them girls right there that the man right here
Tell em
It's in the house, so throw your money in the air and stand in the couch
Laugh at the money that's stuck in the chandelier
Tell them girls right there that the man right here

Is you workin hard (yeah)
How you get around (car)
Is you getting money (yeah)
Is that money yours (aww)

She don't even need a job, got one anyways
She sit up at her desk on Perez all day
Then bossip for gossip
Why be up in concrete
Then she on her Facebook like when we finna party
Twitter with her home girls like what we finna do
They like we gon hit the club but can I hold on to your Choos
Okay now everythings wonderful
Thick girls, small friend, please watch your tummy miss
Three before 12:11, 30 then go in
And they gon get a table cause they flirt with the promoter

Pose, click, pose, click
Now say fuck them other bitches them hoes ain't shit

[Chorus 1] [Pharrell]
All the girls really want is fun
Just a place that they can come
So their wild side has the freedom to run
And last but not least please don't tell no one
