Uhh, what?
Uhh.. uhh uhh
Let's go..

[Jennifer]
Called you on the phone, said "I'm comin through
Hope you're all alone, cause I got plans for you
We could stay at home, or dance and hang all night 
As long as I'm with you, doesn't matter what we do"

Dont ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do, just know that I'm here with you
Dont try to understand 
Baby, there's no mystery, cause you know how I am

[Chorus: Jennifer] + (P. Diddy)
I'm real - what you get is what you what you see
What you tryin to do to me 
You wanna say you're mine
Be with me all the time
You're fallin so in love 
Say you just can enough
You're tellin all your friends (She's a bad, bad bitch)

[Jennifer]
Whoo, c'mon c'mon, uhh, in the pocket..
You like the way I dress, the way I wear my hair
show me off to all your friends and, baby I dont care 
Just as long as you tell them who I am
Tell them I'm the one that made you give a damn

Dont ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do, just know that I'm here with you
Dont try to understand 
Baby, there's no mystery, cause you know how I am

[Chorus] - 2X

{*music plays for 17 seconds*}

[Chorus] - 2X

[Jennifer]
Dont ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do, just know that I'm here with you
Dont try to understand 
Baby, there's no mystery, cause you know how I am

[Chorus] - 3X

{*music plays until fade*}</pre>
