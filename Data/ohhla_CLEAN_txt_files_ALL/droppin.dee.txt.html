[Sentrelle]  
Well I decided to call this one droppin' bombz
According to the procedure and the mic in my palm
But stay calm, the bombs that I drop are kept
Til I step up the steps where they quest for reps
Upon a stage, the sage shall engage the act
And every flow I bestow shall remain in tact
In exact and in fact, the impact I make colossal
Creating and novating like the great Pablo Picasso
Design every line in my rhyme's the climb, up the ladder
So I know my doe will grow fatter
Untouchable, because I'm cuttin' those corners
Just grip into the script like classified orders
Taking over stages like major invasions
Over throw my oldest foe, show I got the dopest flow
No it's no mistake don't massage your eyes
It's why I should I bring the bomb disguise 
I drop bombs
 
[Chorus]
Ain't no mistaking, Sentrelle and Tray D droppin' the bombs
(Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit)
(Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit)
 
Ain't no mistaking, Sentrelle and Tray D droppin' the bombs
(Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit)
(Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit)

[Tray Deee]
Alright, hold up just wait up a mother fuckin' minute
Hoes recognize, checkin' the guiness
Book of world records, microphone checker
Crazy bitch step up, it's like your heffa
Oh yes a, droppin' mad skills on your disk it
Beats so hot, I have you rising like a biscuit
To the shiznit, that I can bitches get drop kicked
Give your ass a slang like the cavi in my pocket
I'm going to rock it (Rock it to the break of dawn)
Tick tock it (It's about three in the morn)
But I'm not finished yet (Give me that joint again)
Where my homiez (Swiggin' on coke and hen)
As I begin, begun, did you hear me come
Take a look around the corner, did you see me I'm the one
Through the cut I kick butt as I rip shit up
Take another swig of the hen in my cup
And now I'm feenin'
Hell of a chronic smoke is what I'm needin'
Now I'm in the corner, screaming like a demon
Yeah I hear you try to bind me nigga
You couldn't find me nigga
I'm right behind you nigga
I drop the bomb

[Chorus]
 
[Sentrelle]
And so, when you hear the boom, make room
Nigga watch out, Cause I got my glock out
Plus a proper knock out
Either one could be the one, if you got feedback
So you better ease back cause I don't need that
Either give me my props when I drop this
Or I peel a cap and I'll leave ya topless
Then you will just be another statistic
If you come dumb cause they none simplistic
 
[Tray Deee]
I hits hard like a nigger, but I'm smooth like satin
When I move through nigger make room for the madam
Seductive as I bust this, nigger trust this
I could give a damn about your cadi and your cutlass
Now I'm commiting straight murder
(So if one time comes around nigger say I haven't heard of her)
Because I'd rather be a thug nigger
Then to sleep six feet in the mother fuckin' mud nigger
 
[Sentrelle]
Droppin' bombs, long beach style with that gangsta twist
(Cause it don't quit)
Now just ride with this
(Cause it don't quit)
