Ohh-ohhhhh, ohh-ohhhhh
Ohh-ohhhhh, ohh-ohhhhh
Ohh-ohhhhh
 
[Mike Shinoda]
I had a friend named Victor
The two of us used to hang every single day
And it seemed like overnight
that his whole life, just changed
I know when his mom and dad broke up
It didn't make sense
But I know that his dad was a drunk
and he gambled away the rent
Pretty soon Vic was seein red
Pissed off, but instead
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out
Then he'd do it all again
The whole time
Smilin on the outside to cover the pain
But on the inside
All he was tryin to do was get away
 
[Chorus: Jonah + Kenna]
He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping, through the craaaaaaaacks
 
[Tak]
Yo, funny how things change color
then fade to another shade
When you had it made it was all good
but now look, just another day
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Now it's all gone, one-two-three; lights out
Which way to turn, can't get a grip
All alone in a big white house
Every day gets worse
and you just curse 'til your head bursts
And it hurts so bad, she left
Now you suffer, should've thought of that one first
No family, no kids
can accept what you did
Now you wanna run away
but you can't cause the past comes back again
 
[Ryu]
Slippin through the cracks
Sip a little Jack, go to bed half dead
What about rent? Why does every cent
gotta be a bet, when's it gonna end?
Oh my God, we don't got a penny left
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Out of debt, out of dodge
Out of breath, out of this big problem
My pop's wanna get away from the pain
in a better place in his brain
but the medication he takes makes him wasted
So sick he was gonna think
the good Lord would come take him
I'm shakin him - "Wake up, you son of a BITCH!"
 
[Chorus 2X: Jonah + Kenna]
He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping through the craaaaaaaacks!
Hiding himself away
Watchin all the memories fade
away from red to blaaaaaaaack!
