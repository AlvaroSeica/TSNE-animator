[Sun Rise Above]
They wanna kill me dead, fill my head with bills of lead
Even if I'm found underground I'll still be red
You can kill a man, but can't kill a revolution
Open warfare in the streets - there heads are shootin
I'm talkin bang bang, billion man chain gang
Obama showed you change, but he's givin you the same thang
We've been locked in solid, who lasts for too long
Next time I'm comin through with more than just a new song</pre>
