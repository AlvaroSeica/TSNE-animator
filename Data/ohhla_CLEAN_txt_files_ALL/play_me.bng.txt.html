Why the fuck you tryin to play me
Fuck you trynna play me
Girl just cuz we fuckin
Don't mean that we
Why the fuck you trynna play me
Fuck you trynna play me
Girl just cuz we fuckin
That don't make you my lady
Why the fuck you trynna play me
Fuck you trynna play me
You act like you my nigga
But I know you niggas shady
Why the fuck you trynna play me dawg
I ain't got time to sit around
&amp; play wit yall
Yu hate me cuz I made it dawg
I guess thats the right thing for me to do is
To wait on yall
Naw fuck that, ima run up in this mutherfucker
Wit my hands up, with my hands up
Daamn us
Some girls they say they cant stand us
But its becuz when we met
We fucked &amp; everytime yu call
I don't answer
Don't play, cuz yu know if there right now
Bitch you try to see me
Yea I fucked yo friends
&amp; yo fuck ass man wanna be me
&amp; Stacy I use to love her
She was there before I blow up but
I guess I juss been gone too long
Or I guess I juss been holdin on too long
Or maybe I puttin me on too long
Whatever it is whatever it may be
Yu got a man &amp; been actin shady
I enjoyed the moments
Girl you made me smile
I just wish I was that you were here with me right now
No I'm really juss pissed cuz u ain't down
Like yu said yu would, like yu said yu would
But I fucked it up
Like you said I would
&amp; I knew I would
But don't be trynna play me
Don't be trynna play me
Say don't be trynna play me
Don't be trynna play me
Uhh &amp; my family
I love family buut the word mean more its embarassing
They then done dropped my name
Drop my name
Talk about ima drop that change
I'm they same old nigga
They same old digits
But everybody about change on niggas
Change on niggas
Its funny how I made &amp; these ppl steady same people
That didn't know a nigga until a nigga started ballin'
I just spent ten in the strip club
Walk in today &amp; these bitches
Actin like they don't know me
I think my new girl really want me
But she with a nigga
