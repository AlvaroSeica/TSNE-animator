[Intro: O.C.]
Yeah...
Yo Jay...
Let's take 'em back on some real deep underground shit, black...

[JS1 scratches]
"I'm O.C. baby, what the fuck y'all thought?" -&gt; O.C.

[Verse One: O.C.]
Post-dramatic, thoughts automatic
Breath control is intact even though I'm astmatic
This a brand new era, now I see things clearer
I keen, sin in my life, ignorin so called killers
Mastered the art of war without involvin the broads
Much wiser than your average rhyme sayers (uhh)
I forgot to introduce myself, as if y'all didn't know
O.C. be the name, same shit, different toilet
Last line was like a chorus, I spit thoughts in orbit
Circlin planets, come back and see the man in office
I'm precise like surgeants, when they cuttin through anatomy
Description when I'm spittin be intelligent insanity
[???] material, correct
Ever since I came in the door, O.C. was well respected
I'll make a beat of elements formin this from the periodical table
I'm beyond the walls of intelligence

[JS1 scratches]
"Beyond the walls of intelligence" -&gt; Nas - N.Y. State Of Mind

[Verse Two: O.C.]
I prescribe antidotes with lyrics, similar to a chemist
Nor what to put in out to put, mine it work like an octopus
With eight arms, sixteen bars of arm
Make up a hundred-twenty-eight bars of darts (Yeah, do the math)
I compose theatrical bloodbaths
It's a rare situation rappers wanna do collabs
I respect a chosen few, it goes without sayin
With O, put in my time now my aim is to blow
Even if I sell passgold this time around I'm like
a stranger in the town, not many raws, I make it right and move on
("Intelligence") ("Intelligence") ("Who will use wits to be a remainder")
Servin 'em love like tennis, scarred is my witness at this very moment
My poetry crush opponents, aiiyo I fear no omens
Yeah, I lost love once in my lifetime, to blow off steam I write rhymes
Phenomenal speak jewels to reach some fools
Learn now and not later from people, it's bad news
Dog, I fail to prevail, in this game called life
No such thing as perfection while you live life
O.C. and JS One, prodigal sons
On some Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth shit ("ooh yeah")
Yo check, I'll make a beat of elements formin this from the periodical table
I'm beyond the walls of intelligence...
