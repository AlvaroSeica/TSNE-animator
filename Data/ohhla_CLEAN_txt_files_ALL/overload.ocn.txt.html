[Frank Ocean]
Ohhh {*4X*}
I know I left with, these heavy thoughts
They been on my mind, oh I
I got cargo with me, all those memories feel
Like a thousand pounds, oh my
In my bed tryin to sleep; the ceiling lowers down
I feel it on me now, oh I

[Chorus]
I been movin buses, further and further
I just can't do this alone, I just can't do it alone
I been pullin airplanes, higher and higher
I just can't move them alone, and I just can't move them alone
It's too heavy for me - overload overload overload
Take over for me, it's too heavy for me
Overload overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload

[Frank Ocean]
Drag my life along, by the end of a rope
Trying to make it by, I'm trying
On the other side, someone's tuggin hard
They only getting stronger, oh I
Balance bricks on shoulders with the grit in my shoes
I'm not strong enough - help me up, help me out

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Take over for me, it's too heavy for me
Overload overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand
It's too heavy for me
I been tryin to hold up the world
with both my hands been holdin up the world
In both my hands can't holdin up the world
It's comin down, it's comin

[Chorus] from "It's too heavy for me - overload overload overload"

[Outro]
Whoa-oh, overload {*3X*}</pre>
