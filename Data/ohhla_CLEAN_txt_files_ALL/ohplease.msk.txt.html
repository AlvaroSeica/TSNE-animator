[Chorus]
Love me love me with all your heart
Tell me that we will never part
Oh please oh oh oh oh oh please
Oh please love me

[Krazie]
Don't you ever take your love away
Ive been praying for someone like you for days
And now that I found you I don't wanna see you go
Don't you walk away baby let me say
Just a little something cariño
That I want you to stay and uh
Please love me cause without you I'm gone see
I need you in my life all of the time
Calling you mine making you mine
Knowing its right the one in your life
The one you call your wife always by your side
Never let you go here to hold you tight
Always and por vida through the darkest night
I'm down for our shit love to hear you say
You'll love me the same calling my name
Having you around knowing that I found
Mi amigo mi esposo mi amante I'm bound
Don't you ever say that you wanna leave
Break my heart in two and bring me misery
Assure me and tell me what I wanna hear
Even if in time you switch up the deal
I want you to know soy tuya remember
Even if you go ill love you forever

[hook]
Love me love me with all your heart
Tell me that we will never part
Oh please oh oh oh oh oh please
Oh please love me

[Krazie]
Don't you know don't you know
Baby boy don't you know that I been loving you more
Ever since you've been gone all I do
And all I can do is just dream
Just been dreaming about you oh please
Baby don't you walk away
Aunque sea tan corto el amor que vivimos
Y tan largo el olvido cariño no te vallas baby
Don't you know don't you know mijo please don't you know
All my tears are running dry
Missing the time you stood by me and called me your wife

[Chorus]
Love me love me with all your heart
Tell me that we will never part
Oh please oh oh oh oh oh please
Oh please love me

[Krazie]
I been through so many things
I don't mean to make you feel like I'm questioning
Everything we have
I just wanna feel I just wanna know
That your love is real
Y que siempre yo contigo estare
Que nunca yo la soledad conocere
Porque tu a mi lado siempre viviras
Y te detendras al quererte ir
Nunca dejaras que llore por ti
Porque prometiste amor siempre serme fiel
Y yo a ti tambien
Asi es que no dudes baby
Take care of my heart and ill do the same
Tatting up your name dentro aqui en mi alma
Ten calma y recuerda quien es la que te ama homie

[Chorus]
Love me love me with all your heart
Tell me that we will never part
Oh please oh oh oh oh oh please
Oh please love me</pre>
