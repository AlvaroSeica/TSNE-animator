Typed by: AZ Lyrics

But he's that one
He's just a manly ese loco
With a plan
He's got them girls
He's got the buds
The triple loaded blunts
At first he stacks
And then he packs
And puts on his surf racks
Hits them waves ten feet high
And they're pounding on the shore
We never wanted this
He never needed that
It's time we take right back
The problems that he's got to give us
He goes to parties
Pushin' shovin' kids
'n drinkin' from the pool
He's throwin' bottles in the air
Sometimes he thinks it's really cool
Never wanted never needed
Never bleeded common sense
See the writings on the wall
And kyle was pullin' down his pants
He never wanted this
He never needed that
It's time we take right back
The problems that he's got to give us
He is the one he's just a manly ese loco
With a plan
He's got the girls he's got the buds
The triple loaded blunts
At first he stacks
And then he packs
And puts on his surf racks
Hits them waves ten feet high
And they're pounding on the shore
(sobriety)...(lets get faded)
They're pounding on that shore
(sobriety)...(lets get faded)
But let me give it to you one more time
(so faded)
You paddle out so far
You think that your gonna die
(sobriety)
You see them waves
They're breaking right over your head
But if your caught inside
You're bound to be dead
We never wanted this
He never needed that
It's time we take right back
The problems that he's got to give
He never wanted this
He never needed that
It's time we take right back
The problems that he's got to give</pre>
