CHORUS X2 [Jelleestone]
Money can't buy me happiness
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want, anytime that I want
Get high when I want

[Jelleestone]
Wake up in the morning
Try to make a move, everyday gotta work
Blue collar on the bus, just to punch a card
Said, you want to battle poverty nigga get a job
Working 9 to 5, the job is hard
Life is hard, right and left of Rexdale Boulevard
It's just factory jobs, that got most my people sweating everyday
Wipe the sweat from your brow what you gonna do now
Gotta pay your tax gotta pay your rent
Making sure you keeping track of every cent
I always keeps a little for entertainment, 'cause...

CHORUS

[Jelleestone]
Stone Poet, know it, better than Bo know it
When my flow hit, it's gonna motivate the whole shit
Keep your head up, smells like a set up
Too many trying to get down while we trying to get up
So defend yours, I'm a defend mine
Look how this money go my peoples locked doing pen time
I'll see y'all when you get home
For all my nigga's dead and gone, rest in peace
I'll see y'all before too long,
'Til then, I'm a keep building
I'm trying to grow old with enough money to feed my great-grandchildren
'Cause I'm still true, and still ain't nothing move but the money
Nigga's will still kill ya in the streets for a fin dummy
Money hafi mek, money hafi spend
From the Guilder to the Yen to the Benjamin
I lived the hood life, I want to live the good life
With a good wife, to kiss good night like... *kiss*

CHORUS [Jelleestone]
Money can't buy me happiness
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want, anytime that I want
Get high when I want
1.5 mil, I ain't gots to front
Money can't buy me happiness
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want, anytime that I want
Get high when I want
Japan to Amsterdam, mic in my hand

[Jelleestone]
Can't buy you happiness, noooo
I came up a poor nigga, raw nigga
Hungry like you ain't never say a nigga
Trust me, I wish I stayed in school
Instead I played the fool
Standin' on the corner choppin' rustys custys
Poliggy want to bust me, cuff me
Kids cross town want to rush me
Cuz they bitches want to fuck me
Make me want to holla!
Another day another dolla y'all
Check the ring around the collar
Fuck the ray ray and the lay lay
Mek yuh know bluntly seh we'll den
When I work I must get pay
Like everyday, broke niggas get no say
In the streets with no loot, might as well be mute
And dollars make cents so let's talk about this
Money hand over fist the root of all evil
It's diluted all people
Inside your hollow but your pockets is fat
You need to fix that, take control!
What's being wealthy if you ain't healthy
What be it a man to gain the world and lose his soul
I said the world's so cold, it's inter outer international
Anyway it come it gotta go
Anyway it go its gotta come, bring mine in lump sums
I'm talking 'bout the dough

CHORUS [Jelleestone]
Money can't buy me happiness
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want, anytime that I want
Get high when I want
Money can't buy me happiness
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want, anytime that I want
Get high when I want
1.5 mil I ain't gots to front
Money can't buy me happiness
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want, anytime that I want
Get high when I want
Japan to Amsterdam, mic in my hand
Money can't buy me happiness
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want, anytime that I want
Get high when I want
I'm trying to buy my Moms a house, I ain't got to front
Money can't buy me happiness
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want, anytime that I want
Get high when I want
Get high when I want, ha ha, ha ha
Money can't buy me happiness
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want, anytime that I want
Get high when I want</pre>
