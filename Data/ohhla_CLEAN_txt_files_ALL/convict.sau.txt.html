The legion is on fire!
The legion is on fire!
The legion is on fire!

[Saul Williams]
I was born in a convict colony
And I was torn from the land that mothered me
Mother, may I? She said, "Yes, you may"
Well, today I... (Declare)
I said, right here, today! 
You're a Convict Colony... if you're running from the sun! 
You're a Convict Colony! A Convict Colony! And you don't really want it...
You don't really want it...

Convict! (repeat 11 times)

[Saul Williams]
I was birthed from the Earth
Fought my way to this day
Now, I'm grown... Truth be told
I'll be here, 'til you're gone
You're a Convict Colony! If you're running from the sun!
You're a Convict Colony! If you're reaching for your gun! 
You're a Convict Colony! If you're running from the sun! 
You're a Convict Colony! A Convict Colony! And you don't really want it...
You don't really want it! (repeat 11 times)
You don't really want!</pre>
