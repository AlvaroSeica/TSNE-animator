That's right all you bitch made motherfuckers trying to step on your toes
Drive by let you go we mob all the time on the south side
All you motherfuckers last man standing, can you feel me?

[Capone-E]
(Chukka, Chukka) As I hold my glock
Sur walking down the street and never will I fucking stop
Call the cops open shots as I hit the corner
Hi power soldiers from California to Arizona
Every corner got a soldier straight packing a chrome
Bumping Capone in the zone
All the haters on the phone
Speaking alone plotting on the heat to make me fucking quit
Think I got no coraz√≥n little leva what'chu think
You some shit eat a dick
When I'm flipping and gripping on you riders??? ???
South side to the fullest got my bullets on that
Checking next time when you're in the area on any motherfucker to disrespect
In a second use a weapon smith and westin or attack
Youngster or fucking vest who's get checked or to the next
Who gets rest pistol gripping always-staying strap
Capping while I'm always fucking laughing
Never the last man standing

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I keep standing
So grab your glocks
I keep standing
So fuck the cops
I keep standing
Always ready to ride
Flipping and slipping riming in my ride never will I hide

[Capone-E]
Be the last man standing straight banging from a side
Full of pride do or die west side when we ride
Homicide comes first putting work doing dirt
??? Was the heard representing my turf from birth never burst
So what you think that I bust never giving a fuck start throwing it up
On a rush on a ride competition wanna cry
Trying not to be on my side but trying to draw me when I die
Oh god a bullet to survive everybody on the streets wants me to die
Never did I cry, puffing on tie getting me high seeing these devils in the sky
Walking by spreading around trying to dirty up my name
Aint a damn thing changed bow down to no man
Leave em In a jaw but I'ma state demanding
All on my own in the zone I be the last man standing

[Chorus]

[Capone-E]
Why you hating on me?
Cause you can't see the enemies in the fleece trying to eliminate me
On the streets concrete or get branded get every day with my motherfucking gage
Aint afraid of the net spent my up coming check with some spense on the place
Face to face with death nothing left grab the tap nevertheless I come with respect
Fuck the rest fuck the rest of them capone-e's the number one in the West
I'm just stressed but I'll never switch sides ride till I die never ask me why (why)
Murdering all my enemies watching them die
Open up your eyes cause Capone-E's full of pride
Bang bang gang bang 187 on my adversaries
Looking at the daily cemetery full of scary barely
Didn't I see you rot up in this dark fucking blast?
And I was hauling my own (Soy Capone)
It's for the last man standing

[Chorus]

[Outro]
That's right Ese
Never will I fucking hide
It's the mother fucking Mister Capone with that E
Keeping it notorious ese (oh I'm down)
Bow down to no man
That's right ese
Like I wise man once said
Those who step on your toes huh
Are really letting you grow
Cause motherfuckers like me keep it going
All you TV, tabloids, plus media, record label, engineers
Do no man do I fear ese
Cause you can't never hold a good man down huh
That's right
And like they said ese
It's not about the war of the lion it's all about that courage
You know motherfuckers like me keep putting it down and never will I stop
So all you motherfuckers remember that Big Capone-E with an E is here to stay
And in the end I'll be the last man standing (last man)
Hah Hah Hah Ha Hah Ha
