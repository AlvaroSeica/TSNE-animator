[Chorus]
Su-preme (Supreme, Supreme) [repeat 8x]

Su-preme people living with they backs aligned
Up against the wall cause these days are asinine
Living in a money matrix, How cats survive
Some will fade away and wither, others will blast a 9
Kings and Queens working 9 to 5's
And making nothing searching for a deeper purpose in life
This CAN"T be life...
? can't be right...
Without no money in my pockets I just can't see right
I used to try to preach to younguns like, "Do right kids"
Now-a-days all that I can say is, "Get it how you live"
Live how you get it, shit!
Don't nobody wanna get...
A promotion up to fry cook like little Calvin did
Some would rather take a gamble, hey they might to bids
The allure of fast money in this hell-bound system
Got you look at two-hundred bucks a week
Versus, like a thousand in a day
Tell me what makes more sense to these...

[Chorus]

Trapped like rats in mazes for the cheese
Every natural resource is here, We don't really need money
But certain people need power over people
They act like that cause they're trapped inside their EGO-sphere
And now you can't feel free
Without material possesions, you can't just be (Be: echo)
And without 'em you're left stressin, so anxiously (Be: anxiously)
So you grab the Smith &amp; Wesson, then aim, then squeeze (Squeeze: echo)
To get what's comin' to ya
The block's so hot, it blew the top off the thermometer
The rush for drama is more appealing than a plane light
Cause life is insane, so insanity is a sane light
It's so easy to see, simple as day and night
SU-preme people born out of the way of the light
In the darkness, trying to fly straight
To some folks it's like being a fish swimming with sharks... shit!

[Perhaphs not since men turned their ears the preachings of a mere prophet
2000 years ago have the words of humble men reached so many with such force
? Perhaps because it has been burning for long, now smoldering
Now bursting into hot flames, now hastily covered over to smolder again
Until the next outbreak.]

[Chorus]

SU-preme people only want the best and uhh
SU-preme people won't settle for less then uhh
Straight from royalty put inside projects and uhh
Capitalist system that don't make sense to ya
SU-preme people put against the fence, Get up!
? hostile if you aint fixing the...
Problem you created that make these condition up
A little reparation for your acts are sent to us
SU-prome ride to die to get the bucks
? by any means so, uhh, lock your benzes up
Tuck your chain and watch and keep your defenses up
All they wanna do is live it up like ?

Chorus

SU-preme...
SU-preme...
SU-preme...</pre>
