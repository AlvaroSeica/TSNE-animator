[Intro: Future]
Just last week, JUST LAST WEEK

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.] (Future)
Just last week I had to ball on 'em
Just last week I had to ball on 'em
Just last week I had to ball on 'em
Sittin tall on 'em, crawl on 'em
Just last week I had to ball on 'em
Just last week I had to ball on 'em
Just last week I had to ball on 'em
Sittin tall on 'em, crawl on 'em, but
  Today I'm on, today I'm on, today I'm on
  Just last week I had to ball on 'em
  Today I'm on, today I'm on, today I'm on
  Just last week I had to ball on 'em

[Big K.R.I.T.] (Future)
Just last week, I had to run up on a nigga like
Where that money you owe me? (Yeah)
Say you got it, well show me (Yeah)
Look up hoe, you know me (Yeah)
Pull up, hop out, clean (Yeah!)
Everybody wanna be a pimp nowaday but
Don't nobody wanna break a hoe, kick a do' 
when the plane don't fly, getcha blimp nowadays
So waddup, dawg? (Turn up)
Ain't nothin changed since pimp when broke (Turn up)
Even I still ride old school (Turn up) 
Paint +Ready+ like Archie Eversole (Turn up)
Slab it out, work it on (Turn up)
{B-Bangin dat Screw from them niggaz that don't know 'bout it}
...I was whippin through the game like 
Nigga how could doubt me? Hol' up

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.] (Future)
Just last week I had to ball on 'em (Just last week)
Just last week I had to ball on 'em (Just last week)
Just last week I had to ball on 'em (Just last week)
Sittin tall on 'em, crawl on 'em (Just last week)
Just last week I had to ball on 'em (Just last week) 
Just last week I had to ball on 'em (Just last week)
Just last week I had to ball on 'em (Just last week)
Sittin tall on 'em, crawl on 'em, but (Just last week)
  Today I'm on, today I'm on, today I'm on
  Just last week I had to ball on 'em
  Today I'm on, today I'm on, today I'm on
  Just last week I had to ball on 'em
