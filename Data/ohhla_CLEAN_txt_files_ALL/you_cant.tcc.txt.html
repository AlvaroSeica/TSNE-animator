[ VERSE 1: Jawn P ]
Let us begin this, Top Choice we're the singers
Get up and dance as the bass drum lingers
Long, keepin the song with a fast pace
Jams like this keep us on top of the rap race
With the vocals I'm stompin out the locals
Takin out the veterans as well as the hopeful
Contenders, to me they're all pretenders
Frontin like they're hard as they try to defend their
Title, your signs are lookin vital
So you better flex cause I'm feelin kinda homicidal
I'm the smoothest, yo, and I can prove this
Check 1-2, yo Force (We can do this, man)
You can't deal, '89 the Peace of Mind
We can release the kind lyrics that teach the blind
Sight, rockin with the style that is original
Suckers stay subliminal while I reach a pinnacle
Of rhymin, climbin up the ladder of success, then
Takin every song that I write as a blessing
In Jawn we trust, I crush and bust the opposition
Who try to take me up position
Don't try to play me, obey every rule that I say
There ain't a brother in the house who can deal with the J
So if you're frontin, son, you better get for real
Huh, you just can't deal

(Think you're able to deal with TCC tactics?
Guess again, you'll never be)

(Top Choice is on the strength)

(Think you're able to deal with TCC tactics?)

(You've got another thing coming)

[ VERSE 2: MC Force ]
Yo, I manage by the means of a cordless
To wreck up shop and penetrate your fortress
Barriers break as I step towards checkmate
Rip up your bishop, a flip of the tip of the record plate
Every rook is hooked when I cast the spell
( ? ) passin blast till the last'll yell
As I stand on top like a pinnacle
When I go heavy not minimal, sensible is the principle
Yo, pay attention and listen when I'm shakin this
I turn a crowd of sucker MC's to Baking Bits
Welcome the Force One with praise
Gaze at the rhythmic actions that originate on center stage
Takin all you got to give till there's nothin left
Me and Jawn a tag team like Mutt and Jeff
Earnin the pay while gettin stupid
I take the beat and loop it (Yo Force, show 'em you get)
Murderous, so if you haven't heard of this
Or understood a word of this or comprehend a third of this
Remember that in tournaments the words are clear and pertinent
And when I get to burnin it you can be reassured certain it's
MC/DJ Force with the power to frost one
MC of two, originatin from Boston
My lyrical quick as I split this in half to reveal
You just can't deal
