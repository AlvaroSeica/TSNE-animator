There's no way back from here on out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go now

She's crashin like an aeroplane
Through a sky of thunderstorm and rain
On auto-pilot she's a flyin, aim
For the target, kamikaze, go up in flames
This life is a toll that she must pay
Pay the price for her mistakes
I guess she only has herself to blame
And to her that's the deepest shame

There's no way back from here on out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go now

She was once a princess
But now she's a mess
A fiend for a fix like the rest
Elicitin sex when pocket less
But she was a sweet thing nevertheless
Back in the day abused as a child
She was always likely to end up this way
The past lived in the dark parts of her brain
And only heroin seemed take away the pain
So she folded the foil and lit the flame
Inhale, exhale out once again
She's on the game, they all now her face
And standard going rate, just not her name
With only herself to blame she lives this hell
But there's a million other girls just like Michelle
Out in the streets with nothin else to sell
To these desperate males other than themselves
So

There's no way back from here on out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go now

I been walkin along this dirty road
For so long now I just can't tell
If there's any way back the way I came
Though I've lost my path, it's the deepest shame
I been draggin myself to the lowest of low
In such a way I just don't know
If the path I take is somethin I can change
But what stands in my way is the deepest shame

There's no way back from here on out
Only one place left to go
One place left to go now
