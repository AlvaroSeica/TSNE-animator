Album:  Scars &amp; Memories
Song:   So Watcha Want?
Typed by: Dopeskill@gmail.com

I make more noise than a chainsaw
Insane pain caused then drained just to give your brain more
I write rhymes with no strain, wet rappers like rain
Bust caps like John Wayne, Shaft or Shane
To build a name, you came to battle me
Get crushed like a candy cane or cancelled like Fame
Always maintain, I elevate game
Grimm use all styles like Sonny Cheeba use crane
Or drunken monk on a punk and leave his ribs sunken
From given fight, tards get shrunken
Vocals never shitty just clean, an instrumental Idi Amin
You lip out, I rip out your spleen
Mine jukes like a Jedi, my right eye's a dead eye
Fuck a drive-by, do walk-bys or fly-bys
To the cops I'm the roughest
I'll put on Starsky and Hutch's on motherfucking crutches
Put to sleep like a stray
I'm so fly I'll pull your girl in a Cavalier and Santa Clause sleigh
No sucker can serve me
I'll have them running circles like a horse in the fucking Kentucky Derby
Competition I'm bagging
Cause niggas try to preach and teach but full of shit like Jimmy Swaggart
Fuck him up, give the nigga more, his ass is mine
Greg Valentine, I throw him in the figure four
Nothing to lose and all to gain
My mother thought she was Raising Arizona but she end up Raising fucking Cain
It's not too many fly-er
Cause I'm cute, but at the same time a 5'9" Michael Myers
I'm about to make dough and niggas hate it
I keep my gun at my hip band, the shit is nickel-plated
Half my life I been called a loser, a bully, abuser
But now I'm making payments on my name

So watcha want, nigga? [8x]
"So step up if you wanna get hurt"
