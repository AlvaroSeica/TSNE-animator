Song:   Pale Blue Dot
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo, when I lift off, I blast right through the clouds and up through the atmosphere
And I hit space, and I look back, and I peer at the massive sphere
Our home, a beautiful island in the vacuum, as I blaze the way through the solar system
One voyager alone, six billion K's away and from here, earth looks like a pale blue dot in the vast enveloping cosmic dark
And suddenly the problems of our world fall apart with the conscious spark that our similarities far outweigh our differences
We see how connected life is, like the moment of clarity is what this image is, nothin puts things in perspective like this

I embark, new freedoms, the stars and truth lead us
The positive vibes that charge my nucleus
Every step, every breath, every life, every death
Every age, every act, empire and collapse
What we know, our beliefs, ideas, every dream, it's everything we think in our minds
The entire history of mankind in time
summed up by that dot in the blink of an eye, I fly

Turn up the music, right about now
cause if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I'd do
Turn up the music, right about now
cause if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I'd do
Turn up the music, pump up the vibe yo
this is music I've been waiting all my life to hear, and I didn't know it
Pump up the vibe yo
Turn, turn, turn up the music
What do you see when you close your eyes? All of the positive messages
This is music I've been waiting all my life to hear, and I didn't know it

Welcome to the next dimension
I myself wonder, how does music place itself in your brain? Why does it make you dance? Why does it make you think? Our message is much deeper than most
It seems that this is our only escape and music is universal love

Yeah, the arrival was survival, positivity was power
We cracked the concrete, to deliver you those flowers
Now that day has wings and can run on air
With a hope, if we spoke, there was someone there

Now I owe it to you to give back what you gave us, cause the fact is you practically saved us from being trapped in a cage to prove my mum right, Max'll be famous
But the cash couldn't change us, we're just thankful our passion can make bucks
And with my fam right behind me, I can hang glide through lightning
Motherfucker, I told you I tango, with a gang, off the chain like Django
In-flight, at a height you could touch an eclipse, cloud nine's got nothin on this
And what a view of the atlas, out here playing pool with the planets
That's right, it's all love round here, cause we don't give a fuck bout fear, tell em

Turn up the music, right about now
cause if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I'd do
Turn up the music, right about now
cause if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I'd do
Turn up the music, right about now
this is music I've been waiting all my life to hear, and I didn't know it
Turn up the music, right about now
turn up the music, right about now
cause if it wasn't for the music I don't know what I'd do
What do you see when you close your eyes? All, all, all of the positive messages</pre>
