[Intro: Panchi]
Uh huh, uh!!!

[Verse One: Panchi]
Yo Preme look what happened when the game got sloppy
Introducin the Lone Ranger the kimosabe
The horse is the big gun, the ten gallon tracks
The hood cowboys with the ten gallon raps
Rockin ACG boots and baseball caps
I agree this ain't the symbolation of the do you
This the shit the shot sent to get used to
GangStarr Foundation the tree, we branched off
Shined eyes yes waited our chance to blast off
Year Round in possession of W-M-D's
Blaq Poet, Nick, Khaleel to NYG'z
I'm makin dollars out of pressure my pipe's are intact
Don't believe me, ask yo' bitch, boy - now back to the track
These recordings be important not responsible for drama
Of Sarah Palin, Joe Biden, McCain and Obama!!!

[Chorus 2X: Shabeeno] (DJ Premier Scratchin)
Man listen, we be on a life or death mission
Get paid like tuition, or caged up in prison
One time for ya mind two ghetto politicians
Three for all my niggas locked down in the system
(N! Y! G!)

[Verse Two: Shabeeno]
They say New York fell of, we'll bring the New York back
I'm like, "Where we went? What part of the game is that?"
We've been here the whole time nigga, anxiously waitin
In the streets paper chasin, Preme testin our patience
Now stop the presses, listen up this is not a lecture
More like a message with a flow that's as hot as peppers
Pop then kill 'em, only way you can stop this villian
I'm sick wit it, couldn't kill me with amoxicillin
I've been the illest since Ill Kid Operation Rat'
The suicide though, I never contemplated that
Then that's a wrap, turn your pages to '03
Chapter NYG'Z, Panch' is my co-deed{?}
No "I" in team homie, picture me solo
Seen what happened to Tony? What he did to Manolo?
There go that New York Giant, back on his shit again
Seen with +Wolverines+ and they wasn't from Michigan
Y'all niggas listenin? Y'all can hear a lyrical
street pharmacist, my cottage rawer than {?}
Rap shit don't work find us, in Tennesee
Lookin for bucks, seein if they still ten-a-key

[Bridge: DJ Premier]
