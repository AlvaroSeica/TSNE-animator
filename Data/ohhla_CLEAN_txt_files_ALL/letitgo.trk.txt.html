[Chorus: Iron Mic (Truck)]
If you thugging like me, my nigga, grab ya gun
Let it go, (let it go, let it go, let it go), that's right nigga
And if you want it like me, bout ya ones when they come
Let it go, (let it go, let it go, let it go)
We screaming fuck the police, ain't no peace
Til they let my niggas go, (let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go)
Ya'll ain't fucking with me, or my team
Let these muthafuckas know, (let 'em know, let 'em know, let 'em know)

[Iron Mic]
These muthafuckas ain't real, man, all they do is lie in they song
You see that heat boy? That mean the Iron is on
That mean it's time to get yo weight up, nigga, you on the block hustling?
Pull the crate up nigga, Duncan Hines flow, time to get my cake up, nigga
Since '94, my nine blow, it done ate up niggas
Talking bout you the best, boy, you need to stop it
We the best in the world, you the best in ya project
So if you think you the loudest, get ya tech and come holla
Put ya money up, I show you how to rep for a dollar
It's our turn, this year boy, we stepping in hotter
Ruthless Air Force One's, step it up partner
So whose the best rapper boy? Don't even bother
We all know you the best actor, you need an Oscar
You get ripped with them box cutters, hit with them choppers
For running to the DEA singing an opera
Just a minute ago, though, you was a mobster
Running round town with ya little revolver
Now you locked up, talking more Antonio Tarver, nigga
I been a Bastard since the death of my father
I stayed at the projects, despite every option, trynna get farther
Gotta do some heavy stacking for my son and my daughter
Prepare for Ruthless, fuck a new world order
Nigga, this is a warning, from them Staten Island boys, cross the water
Got some unused slug, I put the new ones on ya
The chew up on ya, put shoes up on ya
Pardon me, I got my 1-2, 1-2, from the corner
Holding the rap game hostage, nigga, move if you want to

[Chorus]

[Apocalipps]
Aiyo, in '99 caught with the hammer, they sent my ass to the slammer
G'd the parole board up, and now I'm out with the grammer
Sun set, caught the ill gun connect in Atlanta
99 banana got me slumped, pulling my pants up
Hands up, this is a stick-up, murked off in the stanza
Good thing we ain't switch the plans up, things change
Blue and white pulled us over, nigga, put ya hands up
I ain't going back to the canner, no
The way we back these niggas down, you would think we was Panthers
Semi automatic, two desy's busting like cannons
Now they hit my man up, flip, over some Meranda's
Dipped, cuz I hear 'em sirens, running and scrambling
A heist gone bad, you know we die for this though
Let 'em, them pistols, not for sure, muthafucka, we let 'em go

[Chorus]

[Bless]
Aiyo, wrist locked, hop over turnbuckles and pop
When you think of me, you think of Michael Jackson's glitter socks
I'm here to stay, and ya'll niggas is featherweights
Besides that, I done knocked out all the heavyweight
I bring it to you jut for thinking you hard
And I post up like niggas do in Attica yard
I'm the type to punch you in the face, just for fronting
Guns is better off broke, cuz them shits ain't busting
And go get ya click, them niggas won't do nothing
With that weak poker face, I can tell you bluffing
Come on, I got flow, I got dough, I got a chrome four-four
I let it go..

[Truck]
Let it go then...
It was the night Roy Jones got knocked out, the streets was clear
I can smell the fucking beef in the air
And my heard don't pump Kool-Aid and I really don't care
Soon as get to my gun, I'mma fix duke stairs
That's the chrome in garbage can, next to the phone
Straight pop ya head off, fucking split ya done
If I pull out my hammer, I'm letting it go
Whenever we bump heads, hot summer or cold snow
I'm from Staten, where they killed po-po
Give foul glisten reports, we no show
Yeah, we argue with each other, but when it's drama, we form quick
Combine so fast, how to get so thick
I'm not from Texas, but I'm known to 'flip'
It's Truck, I'm that nigga with heart, come through
Dressed up as a bum, bust a shot, I hit shopping cart
Screaming bumba clot, got bullets that'll tear ya big ass apart
Then I rip through ya fucking heart

[Chorus]</pre>
