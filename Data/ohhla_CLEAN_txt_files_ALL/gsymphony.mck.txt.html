[Intro]
Hold up!
YMCMB
DJ Feezy
You already know what it is man
That YMCMB
Some call it that flashy lifestyle
But this is just what we do
This is that everyday life
This is how we live
We got the bitches
We got the cars
Nigga we damn sure got the money baby
YMCMB
Mack Maine, talk to em!

Then who's fault is it anyway
Don't trust what I tell you
Don't fucking move
And no one will get hurt
Don't come in any closer
Don't fucking move
Cause I don't know how much you hurt my heart in 2
Alrighty then!

[Verse 1]
To beat a murder charge in New Orleans is so easy
Shoomies got me spookin, I'm shootin for no reason
Fuck, fucking with the flow it's like fighting with 4 demons
Got 2 forties on me, my gun and my old english
Bitch, turn up the level on my mike
Make it rain in the sun like when the devil beat his wife
See that dude with that gauge and his straight long hair
Better hope like a good neighbor that stay foamed up
It's loyalty amongst thieves but I'll take it if you got it
Let Mack hold my burner while I shake a nigga pockets
It's YMCMB and I check it if you gossip
Long Desert Eagle but it's peckin like an ostrich
You the type of nigga that will tell if a nigga hit you
I'll throw a fuckin cocktail through a nigga window
Flame game flow, you fuckin with the fire starter
I divide the men from the porches, I'm a problem solver

[Interlude]
Bitch!
Soo Woo
Mack I'm tired of these bitch ass niggas
What it be like funk?

Don't come in any closer, don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer, don't come in any closer

[Verse 2]
Mack Maine say fuck em I'm a shoot em
Catch em out the club, follow em, I won't lose em
I had the choppa sing, sing, sing like music
They offer me lean, but nah I don't use it
YMC affiliated, yeah, fuck it, that's my family
Shoot you in your Range Rover, shoot you in your Camry
Broad daylight, New Jack City
I got a mac, turn my hood to left mag city
They got beef with Wayne? Tell em bring it Diddy
I got the hammers in the same bag my reefer's in
And I ain't tryina live, walk my past accolades
Black hat, black mac, black Escalade
I only sell cocaine that's gorgeous
White on white shit, like a pair air forces
My Bronx niggas leave MU corpses
Kendale to Mirror Marr, cocaine fortress
Niggas that will kill you for affiliation
I know niggas that will kill you for initiation
Bad drug deals they kill you for that situation
You shouldn't have put your moms in that situation

[Interlude]
Don't come in any closer, don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer, don't come in any closer

[Verse 3]
What you saying, what you saying?
I'm praying, heaven's a ghetto
Made a crystals when Chris was staying
You ain't the same, you wanna Louis Lane in my Louis swinging
Show you, how to go from Batman from Superman
So you just saying Mack and I react
Like a nigga missed lunch for a good 10 months
And I do this yeah like a done 10 blunts
In the booth so swift, I don't get punched
Ain't telling me shit, young money to death
You ain't got the chips, we run in your breath
Then run in your house, then run in your bitch
In front of the kids, run off the steps
Niggas get doubt, they plottin on loadin no sympathy
Now that you know well I show what I'm mentally drowning around
In the thought that it get me gunned down
If he's down in the boat I proceed to be g
Go on and get it, niggas could get it if we let it be
Fuck an impression, I'm cool with confessing
From young that I want to grow up and be me
That's my slogan, I'm high in the days
I write in the gaze, I put your mind in the maze
Don't never fuck with the boy
It's like crime it don't pay
Except for my boys, will get your body today

[Interlude]
Don't come in any closer, don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer, don't come in any closer

[Verse 4]
Untamed, Young Maine, real nigga money
You got chump change
Cum stains, tongue rings
Wild nigga, Django Unchained
I dump thangs, night at the gun range
For point blank, in your sun frame
If I can't find you
Then I won't mind you...
Off top, I take off tops
A bad bitch and they swallow me like cough drops
My love hot, but that ain't my main attraction
Ol lil one tryina cop, I don't know I'm brick taxin
What Tony Braxton, where Hale at?
Oh there go Lindsay Lohan, where the molly at?
When max spits you, girl will do a back flip
Romantic tear your ass nigga, eat a plate of cat fish, you hear?

Don't come in any closer, don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer, don't come in any closer </pre>
