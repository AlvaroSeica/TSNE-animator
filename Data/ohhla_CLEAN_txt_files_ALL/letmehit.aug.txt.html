Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
You're looking so good right now
And I would if I could, pull you right now
But I know that you're the type to make me crazy
Cause you've got all my homies trippin' on you lately

[Chorus]
I think you put something in the air
Your body's so amazing, and one could even say it's blazing
You're wrapped tight, oh, you've got it going on
Cause you keep your hair nice
Oh, and I ain't even trippin', cause my homies hit first
Cause baby when I hold you, I know we can make it worth
So let me get your contact and the place I can meet you at
Baby, let me hit that super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I know that's super on, and I'm super high
I'm like Superman, cause I'm super fly
Baby, let me hit that super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I know that's super on, and I'm super high
I'm like Superman, cause I'm super fly

[Verse 2]
Now you look good enough to eat
And every time we kiss it's Swisher Sweet
I feel a spark every time we meet, yeah
Yeah, you do things to me...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is
Wash up, make sure I'm presentable, before I lay one finger tip on you
Every day I'm in the whip with you
Crack them windows, let them look-at-whose come close, get a little whiff of you
My new thing and my older Coupe, ain't nothin' changed
Addicted to that, lifted that
Every time I hear your name, I'm ready to let that paper flip
I've never been labelled as a trick, but I'll pay for it if I want it
I'm always high, stuck in the moment
Had a convo with one of my homies
Told me 'bout when y'all first met
How viciously you put it on him
I couldn't even get mad about it
I was there, one of my partners got it
Super loud but she's super soft
Softer than a whisper
Ain't no gold digger, but I ain't never seen her 'round no broke niggas
Come smoke with me...

[Chorus]</pre>
