[KJ-52]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
Before I had status and a two way pager
You could find KJ listenin to hip hop
Blastin it so loud my parents were like "turn it off"
I used to rock turtlenecks wit Mc Hammer pants
Watch Yo Mtv raps jus to check out the lastest dance
I did the runnin man, they said not bad for a white man
I siad I'm not really white, I jus really need a tan
I used to write the girlies numbers down apon my hand
And I didnt go nowhere wit out my tapes and walkman
Rollin up the bottom of my pants as tight as I can
And I'm up late at night talkin to my girlfriend and

[Chorus]
Back in the day I was so cool [I was so cool]
Back in the day I was so cool [The coolest one in school]
Back in the day I was so cool [Well I cant lie to you]
Back in the day I was so cool [I was a nerdy little dude]

[KJ-52]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
I wanted lines in my eyebrows so I took a razor
But I messed up and accidentally I just shaved the
Whole eyebrow off I was like, "Im goin crazy"
See it was jus tough jus growin up in the 80's
But for me it was rough cause no girls would ever date me
All the ladies I asked out was like... "well, maybe"
You're okay, but you're no Patrick Swayze
Unfortunately I think that all my teachers hated me
Cause I sit in the back makin noises like I'm crazy
Ahhh... but its all gravvy
In third period today I asked out this lady
Got the paper out got the pencil now whoops here I go
Will you go out wit me, check yes or no
Im feelin all slick when I handed her the note
I told you 10 times already no, now leave me alone

[Chorus]

[KJ-52]
Back in the day when I was a teenager
I was only fifteen when I jus met my Savior
And he came in straight in my heart and jus changed the
Way the used to live in all my ill behavior
See its amazin to see my life that I jus gave ya
So amazin to me Jeus Christ you became the
Savior to me and I aint never been the same the
Way I would be back in the day it would amaze ya
But the change  that I see it was done in a major
Way that would be so that all I can do is thank ya
And everydat jus for me is a new day to praise ya
Cause you came jus to be all I need and you jus made a way for
Me too see so I broke it down for you
Now Ima take ya back in the day kind of like this dude..

[Chorus]</pre>
