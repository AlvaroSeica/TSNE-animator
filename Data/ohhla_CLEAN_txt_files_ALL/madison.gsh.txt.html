Pretty pictures in your favorite magazines
span the distance between you and Mr. Clean
You can take part in the All-American dream
just fill your house up with a million
products you don't need

You don't ever have to use them
Buying is all that's asked of you
But if it's so God damn incredible
you can't believe it's true
it's Madison Avenue

Make it all commercial
there ain't nothin' folks won't buy
New fuel to fire up the monsters of Free Enterprise
Gizmos and gadgets, batteries to make them run
Just give your check up at the first of every month

And don't wake up to the uselessness
'till your whole life is overdue
'Cause if it's so God damn incredible
you can't believe it's true
it's Madison Avenue

They can sell sand to a man livin' in the desert.
They can sell tuna to the chicken of the sea...
You are surrounded and confounded and
dumbfounded by the happenings yes it's true
it's Madison Avenue</pre>
