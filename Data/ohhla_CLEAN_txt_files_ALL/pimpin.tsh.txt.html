[Tash]
Yeah, this is the part where the party get live y'all!
My name is CaTashTraphe for the fellas
But all the ladies, y'all can call me "Rico"
Cuz that's my name
And this is my night tonight
And everybody knows "Rico" got the "HOO!"
I got fly hoes lined up like they gettin free weaves
Who's next to test my sex expertise
Mister All-Nighter, excites ya when he bites ya
Tash be havin bitches crawlin walls like a spider
Cuz you heard me on the radio ya seen me on the TV
If you get my drunk enough I'll eat that pussy like a kiwi
My dick be comin at ya like 3-D glasses
I always get it poppin wit my backstage passes
Tash is, mackalicious, rap style vicous
Can't help you wit your rent but you can help me wit these dishes
My little mistress said 
"Tash you look suspicious, what the fuck you thinkin 'bout?"
You know my other bitches
I got it, goin on wit the flowin
I'm the flyest rapper out and ladies wouldn't even know it
(Say what!) This how it's goin, Likwit flowin like fluid
Pimpin ain't easy but somebody gotta do it
How you want it baby? (In the front, in the back)
Do you like it baby? (Yeah I like it like that)
Well we can do it baby, fast, slow, hard or soft
Cuz this is what happens when the lights go off

[Chorus]
That nigga "Rico" got "HOO!" 3x
"Rico HOO!"

So fuck wastin half the night tryin to find Miss Right
Me and my niggas start to holler first bitch that's tight (hey!)
My Likwit niggas do it right until the broad day light
The best head I ever got was on a airplane flight
Type to death single minglin that lays the pipe well
It's off from the second I smell that Chanel
Wit steel-belted condoms wit the bulletproof shield
If you ain't got no weed, once I fuck, happy trails (See ya!)
Tash tips the scales at one-seventy-nine
I'm designed to push these lyrics down assembly lines
So my style is blue collar but the ladies still holler
If you sayin I'm a dog, that means you fucked a rottweiler
Top dollar rhyme inker, that's half my appeal
No scars on my grill, nah bitch I'm not Seal
I'm just a fly nigga that likes to keep it real
If you don't feel me yet, keep listenin and you will!

Chorus

So last of all I'd like to say before I get on my way
Is leave your dike friend wit Tash, the next day she won't be gay
Matter of fact, she'll probably say "Last night, it changed my life"
Cuz I beat it up so good she took me home to meet her wife
Cuz Tash lay the wood so good I leave em screamin
I hurt em by myself so no need to double-team em
I stick em wit the pole till they lose control
But I'm not here to save ya, nah girl that's not my goal
I'm comin outta Cali so you know we don't love ya
Even if you was my girl I would still wear a rubber
Cuz this is how it's goin, Likwit flowin like fluid
Pimpin ain't easy but somebody gotta do it

"Rico HOO!" 11.5x</pre>
