[Intro: Ice-T]
Yeah, motherfuckers in my face, man always
Telling me how to make records, FUCK THAT!
I've been making records for fucking fourteen years
Yeah, Raw Breed ?? about want to do this shit violent
I'll do it.. MY WAY!!

[Bizarra]
Yo, it's my way, no way, get dumped on the highway
Buck, buck, feel the blast from my gun spray
Yeah, you're getting drowned in the blood
A bug, thug, feel the cops catching slugs

[Ernie C]
Yo, it's my way, I slay, I play, you stay down
You fuck around in my town, you drown
Fuck you, fuck them, fuck that
We come back through, murdering your crew, what?!

[Ice-T]
You don't know shit about my lifestyle
It's buckwild, late night gunfights, three strikes
I'd rather fight, caught in the street
You get beat down to raw meat
Fucking with me and the Breed, you'll soon bleed

[Bizarra]
Yeah, it's Raw Breed, BC killing overseas
Dropping off rooftops, punks hang from trees

[Ernie C]
Night vision, incision, the opposition
It's never your decision.. My way!

[Ice-T]
You can't tell me jack shit, suck my dick
Out my face with that drama, I'll kill your fucking mama
Iller than a postal worker, born to murder
Suckers in my face with that bullshit die quick

[Bizarra]
It's Bizarra, ha, cause mad horror
It's the dusted world of Bizarra
High on acid, the ghetto bastard
Yo punk, I'll put your ass in a casket

[Ernie C]
You in a world of shit, fucking with the Syndicate
We pack full clips, and then we're done with it
Come with it, we get it on you, you ain't lasting
Demolishing, the demolition

[Bizarra] Piss on your grave, a killing craze
[Ernie C] In your town right now on any stage
[Bizarra] Who the fuck are you, trying to dis my crew?
[Ice-T:-] Who dies tonight bitch? - You!
[Ernie C] My way!

[Ice-T]
I will do what I choose, and if I loose
Well then I loose.. My Way!
This is my fucking life, and if I die
Well then I die.. My Way!

[Chorus:]
My Way!! My Way!! My Way!!

[Break:]
[Ice-T:-] Yo Bizarra, you're bugging, put the gun away from.. 
[Bizarra] Fuck that! I'm high and dusted
[Ice-T:-] You're tripping man, don't do it.. 
[Bizarra] Fuck that nigga! (*Gun Shot*)

[Ice-T]
I will do what I choose, and if I loose
Well then I loose.. My Way!
This is my fucking life, and if I die
Well then I die.. My Way!

[Outro: Ice-T]
?? up in this motherfucker, you know what I'm saying? (YEAH!!)
Raw Breed is in the House (THOROUGH!!)
Blowing heads nigga (NARCOTIC!!)
It's going down (FUCK THAT!! WE GONNA SET THE RUCKUS!!)
You ain't ready (WHAT NIGGA?!! WHAT?!! WHAT?!!)</pre>
