[Speak]
Pyramid house
Super 3, heh
Art, fuckin, goons
I'm riding on that trill wave, tryin to get my bills paid
Ecclectic indie bitches say I'm colder than that chill wave
Frostbite and igloos, deep freeze and snowstorms
Winters in Denmark; I ain't tryin to keep them hoes warm
Rap quotes and fur coats, I'm layin for the season
I can testify, that Hell is high, because I'm friends with a couple demons
They breathe that sulfur, that brimstone, that evil, that fire
We're drinkin holy water from a bottle made of iron
I'm a sinner, I'm a liar, I'm a healer, I'm a saint
I'm everything you've never been, I'm everything you ain't
See that paint drip off my canvas, so far from average
Blood stains my bandage, it's so hard to manage
the flesh wounds, the typhoons, the rich men, the tycoons
They talk fast, they think slow, they live hard, we die soon
We get high, we get by, exploring inner space
They wanderin and squanderin life tryin to find they place
But they can't

[Chorus: Def Sound] + (Speak)
But they don't know how and they don't know why
What's inside, what's inside (out my mind)
But they don't know how and they don't know why
What's inside, what's inside (they say I'm out my mind)
Talk dirty, but you know my verse clean
Way too trill, so you know that my surf's mean
Talk dirty, but you know my verse clean
Way too trill... you know my surf's, hey~!

[Speak]
Too cool for the rich kids, too hood for the hip kids, too hip for my own hood
Good lord I'm a devilish prick, lookin for trouble cause I'm no good
So I get caught in the low tide, then I get high like a low life - huh
When the weed kick in, my whole world spins and I shine like a strobe light - swag!
Too cold for the icebox, too street for the sidewalk, too slick for the sidetalk
I rock like a death metal band and I stack my guap' like a pyramid scam
I'm savin all my pennies for some Remy and some Henny
And those nasty Nancies who are tryin to get friendly
We tryin to get cozy, cocaine for the nosey
I play that average fruit for her and she undresses slowly
Slowly, but surely, the sun's up, it's early
A few more years of nights like this and I'll be dead by 30
Them black birds and green skies, my clouds are lined with sterling
Fools gold and rhinestones, them lustful eyes are burning
Dirty pictures on the iPhone, that passion's never real
Pyrite and rhinestones, they lack authentic feel

[Outro: Def Sound] + (Speak)
But they don't know how and they don't know why
What's inside, what's inside (they say I'm out my mind)
But they don't know how and they don't know why
What's inside, what's inside (I'm fuckin out my mind)
Talk dirty, but you know my verse clean
Way too trill, so you know that my surf's mean
Talk dirty, but you know my verse clean
Way too trill... you know my surf's, hey~!
You know my surf's, hey~!
You know my surf's, hey~!</pre>
