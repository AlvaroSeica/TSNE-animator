She said I'm feelin optimistic now, got a new crazy plan
I'll wake up I'll be 50 if I wait for you, baby and
you know, you have your whole career to think about
And if I follow right behind you all I'll do is dink around
It's a, big call yeah but it's a bigger world
And I'll see it all cause I'm a big dream type of girl
My daddy said you're only young for a minute
Then it passes like a blink love you'll feel it when it's finished
Cause you never go back home, can never go back
No you'll never get it back, not never ever it's gone
So with that, guess it's goodbye for this evening
Goodbye babe I'm leaving, say hi when you see me</pre>
