[Fieldy]
Burn down to the ground everything I own 
Everything you need is temporary 
And everything you want is so petty 
Materialistic shit makes me sick 
You're through with your cars, your house, your money 
It's just for now doesn't sound funny 
Your wife, your kids your family, your life 
It's just for now it's just not right
Open your eyes and you'll see the light 
Stop living in a fairytale life 
There's more to life than just living 
Find it in yourself and start giving 
It'll come back to you no one's out to sue you 
I lost everything I had I'm not even mad 
Losing everyone I love will make me sad
If you dwell on the past you simply gonna last

Chorus: Jonathan Davis
 
You will not take my mind
You will not take what's mine 
You think you can hurt me by stealing from me (oh why)
You think I owed to you
This is everything I do
You rape me take from me
But you ain't got me
 
[Fieldy]
This pain and misfortune is pure fucking hell
Take it away nothing will change
 I will still Feel the same this is too much pain 
Am I being Tortured time will only tell 
Am I insane or am I in hell 
Gotta have faith not someone to scorch it 
Live your own life no reason to rebel 
All of this hatred this has to be hell 
Feeling down on yourself try living my life
More money more problems that ain't no lie 
If you take it all away I rather scream bye 
Day by day one day at a time 
Doesn't make me gay It takes a man to cry 
Your not alone wipe that tear from your eye 
Life is a gift you should put it on a throne 
Not materialistic shit appreciate your life
 
Chorus
 
[Fieldy]
I can't wait to die (die) if it's up to me 
I wouldn't be alive (alive) not suicidal
But I've had a rough life drugs will make 
You dumb but they won't kill your pain
Look at the bright side I'm trying to stay 
Sane I would never take my life over 
Depression and pain that's just part of life 
Life, life it's just a test treat it with respect 
You're here for a reason not to be depressed

Chorus x 2</pre>
