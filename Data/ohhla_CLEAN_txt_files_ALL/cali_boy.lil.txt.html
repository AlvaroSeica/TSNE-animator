Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I g-g-g-g-gotcha don't I girl
I l-l-love you, yes I do
Every time I see those light blue eyes
I start to think about you and I, you and I

[Chorus]
I'm just a California boy [X8]

[Verse 2]
I see you at the beach why don't you speak to me
Yeah I look kinda strange but it's okay
If you knew about love then you know that it's in your heart
And I wanna show you it's okay, it's okay, it's okay

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So much love is in the air
Just go take a look outside
Peace is the only thing that we can do
And all we can do is try, do is try, do is try

[Chorus]</pre>
