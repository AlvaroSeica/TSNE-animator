Song:   That Other Shit
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus - 4x]
I'm on that other shit, spitting for my brother shit
Hardcore gutter shit, duct tape and some other shit

[H.A.W.K.]
I'm on that other shit, that duct tape and some other shit
That sex with no rubber shit, that fuck but don't love her shit
I'm on that other shit man, you feel what I'm sayin
I'll push you to next land, the same color as sand
I'm on that other shit, I'm in Sean John like Puff
I spit rugged and rough, so don't call my bluff
Yo flow is cream puff, it ain't hard enough
Continue to huff and puff, and I'm gon show my stuff
I'm on that other shit, the flow is ferocious
Super-cali-fragi-listic-expi-ali-docious
More cream than Hostess, won't lose my focus
Why you screaming paid, and you know you the brokest
I'm on that other shit, yeah I done changed labels
Same horse, different stable, putting food on the table
In this camp I'm champ, I hit a big up amp
I spit shit that claps, and gives the track a cramp

[Chorus - 4x]

[H.A.W.K.]
Like Ja I rule, plus I'm so old school
I'm already on fire, and you gon add to the fuel
All the bitches drool, when I'm pulling up
The Cadillac truck, roof popped up sitting on dubs
I'm not giving a fuck, the lot done shut down
And my rims 23 inches, off the ground
Lyrically I clown, using verbs and nouns
And pound for pound, H.A.W.K. is the best around
I'm on that other shit, I'm cold blooded and raw
One swing's break jaw, have you eating out a straw
Dead End outlaw, trick tracks like hoes law
The best you ever saw, at your ma and pa
I'm on that other shit, forfilling a ghetto dream
It's in my bloodstream, I must reign supreme
I make rappers sing, and lower they self esteem
I spit hotter than steam, and not need a king
I'm on that other shit, if I'm lying, I'm dying
I pull out that iron, and commits the fine
I'm on that other shit, been thuggin' since my youth
My lifestyle is proof, that I am the truth

[Chorus - 4x]

[H.A.W.K.]
I'm on that other shit, cause I'm throwed with wordplay
Like Jordan's fade away, its any time any day
Most people say, that they my prodigy
And try to pull tre, the H-A-W-K
I try to break away, like Kuta Kinte
My bullets they ricochet, mayday, mayday
I'm on that other shit, so don't try to mock me
I'm 6"4 and stocky, my attitude is cocky
Most niggas jock me, but that doesn't shock me
My heart's bigger than Rocky, and they flow is sloppy
I'm on that other shit, I refuse to lose
Been used and abused, but still paid my dues
I'm on that other shit, that shish burn, deep cover shit
That bring tears to your mother shit
That in the Benz burning rubber shit
That Mel Gibson, Danny Glover shit
I'm on that other shit

[Chorus - 4x]</pre>
