Chorus

If I was dreaming
I would pinch myself until I came awoke
but all I see is living evil
couldn't say it isn't so
I think my demons found the need to interfere
and come between my happiness and me
but evil wouldn't say if it was so...

Verse One

I search for evidence and help as I would stand
to plead my case of all the negligence I represent at hand
I see mistakes as if they stepped and breathed the same as I
telling me I was made to die
and would never be called to save a life but whatever they thought
I'd make a lie with disappointment chilling with me
failure got upset and started feeding off of jealousy
and rage till I confessed that I was leaning off the edge
of fear with ropes around my neck, so
I just leaped
thinking I was sleep and away from this world of stress...

Chorus

If I was dreaming
I would pinch myself until I came awoke
but all I see is living evil
couldn't say it isn't so
I think my demons found the need to interfere
and come between my happiness and me
but evil wouldn't say if it was so If I was dreaming
I would pinch myself until I came awoke
but all I see is living evil
couldn't say it isn't so
I think my demons found the need to interfere
and come between my happiness and me
but evil wouldn't say if it was so...

Verse Two

I had a conversation asking Death why does he follow us but as his daughter
Fate got in the way
he chose to bottle up and said
'Your world was made for life and not every one wants to make it right
so I made it hard on the brainless lives
who would take their own Earth for granted
while some children live with illness
but smile until their sleep and never hurry into worry
of designer clothes or cheap
knowing we praise these knitten threads
there lies a day that sits ahead when lights and fame
will sit impaired and not what you take with when you're dead...

Chorus

If I was dreaming
I would pinch myself until I came awoke
but all I see is living evil
couldn't say it isn't so
I think my demons found the need to interfere
and come between my happiness and me
but evil wouldn't say if it was so If I was dreaming
I would pinch myself until I came awoke
but all I see is living evil
couldn't say it isn't so
I think my demons found the need to interfere
and come between my happiness and me
but evil wouldn't say if it was so...

Verse Three

I'd rather gaze at lightning next to telephone poles
wearing highly flammable garments as my cellular phone roams
letting rain soak the pain
hoping that it acts like novacaine
hoping to react like 'so insane'
only to be absent on the brain
'cause I can't bear an extra minute living daily in the midst of sinning
sinning daily in the midst of women
when it's steadily I'm hit by tempting stones (Ow!)
why must I feel alone and out of luck
and see a long streak wishing I was sleep
and away from this world called 'Home'...

Chorus

If I was dreaming
I would pinch myself until I came awoke
but all I see is living evil
couldn't say it isn't so
I think my demons found the need to interfere
and come between my happiness and me
but evil wouldn't say if it was so If I was dreaming
I would pinch myself until I came awoke
but all I see is living evil
couldn't say it isn't so...</pre>
