[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high

[KiD CuDi]
Yeah, back up in the mix
Aloha nigga, Cudi lookin' for a fix
Got enough dough, just to take a trip
To get a little pinch of the Maui Wowie
Oh man, here we go again
If you ever get a chance, smoke it with a friend
Me n' Pat on a mission to get
Lifted like John Legend and shit
Get Lifted, hey!!
Let's get lifted, hey!
What you gon' cop
Maybe a dub, maybe a zo
No matter what you cop, you should smoke it 'till it's gone
Walkin' on the beach with the sand between your feet
And all the Hawaiian girls sing to the beat
"Hey, What it do boo?'
You smoke? Good.
Yeah, me too."
Livin' in paradise, all through the night
And even in the day smoke 'til I can't see
What can I say, nuthin' like this in the world home-ay
Make you feel great, you forget you in the states
You might relocate, so you smoke all the Maui Wowie you could take
Like (inhale sound)

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high

[KiD CuDi]
I know, I know, I know
I really need to go, go, go, go, go, go
Really need to go, go
Really need to go, go, go
Man, I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
I know, I know, I know
You really need to go, go
You really need to go, go, go
Man, I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie</pre>
