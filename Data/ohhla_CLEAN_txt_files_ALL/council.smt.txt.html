	"How many MC's" "Out there peddling" (Scratched 4x)

[Cage]
Look at shorty from the Shining, all grown up rhyming
Still talking to my finger, but now it's through bitches stomach lining

[Mr. Eon]
I'll be the Smut Ambassador, bend her over point the ass back at a
Then I'll fucking laught at her

[Cage]
Picture me giving a fuck, that's Polaroid ?cunt seven?
Or Hot 97, with a yes-man brethern

[Mr. Eon]
Starbuck's stuck, you stained with feces
The only man who make roaches interchange species

[Cage]
I'm smacking DJ's for playing instrumentals for the wack mentals
Spitting all over the mic rentals
Bring all your dogs! My name is Cage Kennels
Not ???

[Mr. Eon]
At age 12 I spit my first rap out
In the 80's on your block like the first crack house
It's Eon cold-hearted, smoke a whole carton
Decapitate my best friend if he's bogartin

	"Quick to be like" "Peddling smut!" (Repeat 4x)

    "What kind of shit are you peddling?" "P-p-porn" "Smut peddlers"

	"You wanna talk this old school bullshit about the rules?
	 Well here's a rule you might remember:
	 I'm the motherfucking fucking one who calls the shots"</pre>
