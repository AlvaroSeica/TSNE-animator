[Intro: Some guys talking]
The spiked red hair...and the..and the, paint on his face
Whow, hold on man, Tech is losein' it man
He's not as grounded as he used to be
Tech was a devil worshiper
You know you see a black dude with red hair
And a long beard, I mean look he look scary to me too
Yeah that nigga Tech man he sellin' out man
That..that's he's doin' that for the white folks
Thats white shit he doin' man

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I've been writing for 
Nineteen years for sure
Hate rules in these times
Niggas don't wanna see me shine
Stop me, and then try and tell me (Come gangsta)
And then compare me to Nelly (Wanna bang bra?)
So this songs is gonna tell me
(So called gangsta niggaz what the fuck is always tryin to break a G)
Hey, I've been bustin'
And fizz knuckin' bitches
It tizz nothin' for years puffin'
I've been clutchin' riches from his muffin' 
Heres fuck you niggas this is toughin' I
(Don't know what the fuck you thinkin' tellin me this shit is hella fake)
Say, since way back in the days rappin'
The blaze happen
I raised raves craves days would blade packin'
And stage saggin'
Theys wackin' Nina stays layed backin' I
(Rap at nigras contantly they never know the money Nina makes)
Hey, this is amazin' how niggas formulate they hatin'
You fuckin' fornicate your mistakin' 
We can never coralate cause you fakin', huh
Who's bringin' in through the bacon, huh
Who's keepin' this shakin', huh
(Got any questions Sinister Tech and Tecca Nina niggas know the rest)
Gay, is all you punks and mitch bades diss in your trunk won't get played on the radio
Too gangsta for an old lady bro
Gangsta niggas don't hate me no
Wanksta niggas won't face me though
(Talkin' shit and book smart people tellin' me that I really need a vest)
Okay!

[Bridge 1: Tech N9ne]
I rep the town harder than any of you niggas
Where ever I stand my bills the same punk
And you got the nerve to tell me

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Come gangsta
Throw your rags in the air
And know that nobody there
Will compare to your gangsta
Saggin' pants to the floor
Every womens a bitch or a whore
When your gangsta
Pack ya guns in the club
If they shrug give them thugs mean mug ya come gangsta
Is what they sayin' to me

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I shoulda been done come wit a gun
For the ones who bump they gums who the one
Said a nigga was'nt gonna make another record said I was wack and washed up done
Said a nigga might scare lil' ones
He's a fuckin' nightmare, here he comes
With red hair and my face painted 
They said (Gangsta)
Messy Marv and Colione is so (Gangsta) 
But I really ain't (Gangsta)
I need to come up wit a (Gangsta)
Scritch the scratch my nigga fat tone is so (Gangsta)
You need a bit of that (Gangsta)
You need to hang wit a (Gangsta)
Mr. Stinky Vigalante so (Gangsta)
Brother Lynch is (Gangsta)
Da Bigga Bigga is (Gangsta)
57 RDVs are so (Gangsta)
The nigga fifty is so (Gangsta)
They say!
When you in them streets, creep creep
Cause some gangstas want a head blast
Cause I run with the red rags
And try make the feds flash
Try to swipe my bread stash
(That's that bullshit I'm gon skip and try to go get the money grip)
Okay, you niggaz kill me in Nosferatu vampire bit my shit
Cause you niggaz feel me, surprised that I got you right here with my shit
So you gotta be thankful to who?
By the way homie what's gangsta to you?
(Money, dope and alcohol and plenty bitches all up on your dick)
I got that
How can C-Bo be wrong?
How can Yukmouth be wrong?
How can Lynch be wrong?
How can 2 Pac be wrong? Bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I've been nice to you rapper cats for a long time
I left Kansas City so them other cats can gon shine
But it seems these punks are confussed because I'm my own kind
But I'm back on deck cause Kansas City is who's throne? Mine!
This ain't no punk shit
Nigga this is strength at it's finest
I made this shit so you all you simps can rewind it
Meaning, you pussys who says this Tech shit ain't hard for real
And try to disregard the real
You mutherfuckers is hard to feel
I get your death threats cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs, alcohol and bling shit
But I stay a hella game
And you punks is so lame
Cause all my gangstas ridin will demolish your whole team
I've been with every rapper who's legendary
Underground to mainstream know that Tech is very hard
Cause I bring the heater
Love me cause I'm your leader
Bitches they suck my peter
While I drinkin' Margaritas
Niggas get layed down
Seven displayed sounds
N9ne the crayzed klown
Lines like sprayed rounds
This is for all you haters who don't pump my shit
If you say this ain't gangsta you can suck my dick!
I might look like a clown
But you niggas sound like a muthafuckin' circus
Fuck you muthafuckas!

[Outro: Yukmouth]
This nigga is the tightest nigga movin' man
I mean...Tech N9ne will dimalish all you niggas
From the stage show, to rockin' the mic you name it
Thats why I roll wit him he my favorite rapper real talk
