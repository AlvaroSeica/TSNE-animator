[Dominator]
Whoa-oh
Wow
Whoa-oh
Where she from?
Uh-hmmm
She is amazing
Mm-mmmm
Whoa-oh
I've never seen her around here before (Whoa-oh)
I'm gonna go get her name
Mm-mmmm
Yeah
So fresh baby

(Verse 1)
So fresh, she's so fresh
Brand new
Never had to met a female who looked like you
Kinda weird
But when I looked at your face
Don't laugh, but I couldn't figure our your race
Somethin' different
Nasty
Tasty, sexy
The sound of your voice even seemed to impress me, whoa
You please my eyes, you make me rise
You got them perfect thighs
Girl, what's your name?
Girl, where you from?
Girl, can I get me some?
Look at your eyes, even got bomb hair (Oooh)
I ain't a pervert, but I gotta stare
She's strange
Somethin' I ain't never had (Never)
But I wouldn't mind
Hookin' up with that
We can have a few drinks
Open things up
I hope you don't mind if I tear you up

Chorus: Dominator
Your love is bomb
Your love is fresh
Your style is cool
I'm feeling you
you feeling me, too
Your body's bangin' (Uh!)
I'm anticipatin'
To get with you
I'll make you move
Sugar, what you wanna do?

Bridge: Dominator
Girl, if you let me take you home
Take me home, take me home
I promise I will call tomorrow
Call, to-mo-rrow
And if, by chance, you let me bone
Let me bone, let me bone
We gonna leave the lights on
Oh, yeah
Dominator, Dominator, that's my name
Ain't too many hoochies hip to my game
When you see my eyes and you hear my jive
Baby, can each other difference from the truth you like

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Dominator
Check it out, girl
You make me feel like (Oh!)
I wanna make you scream like (Oh!)
Yeah
So fly, so fresh
I must confess, your love's the best
You make me feel like (Oh!)
I wanna make you scream like (Oh!)
Yeah
So tight and cute
I can't explain, this lust for you

(Verse 2)
She got a big ol' bag, she got a ghetto rap
She got class, stop, she gotta be like that
Look at that bounce on the dancefloor, ouch
More bounce to the ounce, and you know all of that counts
Come with me
I'm a set you free
I'm weird like you
Weird as can be
There is such a place
That creates
Such, a melody
And if you let me find it
I'm a get right back behind it
See, I'm old school, baby
And you got that flavor
Nobody even comes close, I'm a take her
Go on, and get to get my grub on a plate
And find a big park, and stay, so we can go out, to I don't know
When, real late, pick the girl up at eight
Think I find me a mate, Nu Shooz, I Can't Wait

Repeat Chorus</pre>
