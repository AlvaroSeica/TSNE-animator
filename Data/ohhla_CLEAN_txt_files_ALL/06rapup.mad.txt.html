[Intro]
What you want me to do?
I'm sorry
I'm back
S-K-I-double L-Z
It's not a diss song
It's a real song

Yeah, check it...

It's your boy Skillz
And I'm fixin' to act up
Since y'all keep askin' 'bout the '06 wrap up
Yeah, pull up a chair tell you what I'ma do
For you and yours
Hold the applause
It's the year in review

[Verse 1]
Steelers stole the Super Bowl
Lets give it up for them
And Eminem, he gave in
Got married to Kim
The violence started
Hip hop was sort of rollin' them dice
Which haters almost stole the light from my man Obie Trice(That's right!)
Then Chapelle's Show came back on
But after a few episodes it was clear he was gone
And I hate to see the homie Dave go
But I love that show about them small sixteen year olds
And them two Indian chicks
Damn near had me cryin'
When she was like "Duh, don't get your hair done like mine?"
What else, huh, let me see...
That's around the time when Cam went after Jay-Z
The Oscars got down with the P-I-M-P
And Three Six kept it cool when they was on TV
Then T. O . switched teams, but I didn't notice
'Cause I was gettin' some gettin' some
You know what I mean
DMX got bagged again
Driving while black
While his wife did one hundred with his kids in the back
What you know about that?
T. I . made it clear
You might sell
But you won't top the king this year
Then Joc and Nitty came with a brand new sound
And everybody went to the mall it was goin' down
We all did the motorcycle two times when he showed us
After Tom Cruise did it, for me it was over
Dick Chaney, crazy with the twelve gauge
And everybody and they mama got a MySpace page
Yeah, we all got the "itis"
Mine is MySpace dot com backslash your ghost writer
Cheap love, yeah no doubt
Take some chicken noodle soup
I let it rain, I clear it out
And Russel and Kimora decided to stop it
And your jeans had to have some design on the pocket
Dallas Austin
Yeah, dude got screwed
We ain't look at TV, we just went to YouTube
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Yeah, that track was nice
But it's not rap if you're saying the same things twice
The rumor was Rihanna, was doing Jay
Christina Milian went public
With Cool and Dre
"Just Say I" was her first selection
She should have named it "Just Say I Ain't Sellin' No Records"
And Janet Jackson flopped hard
Her album did so bad
That Jermaine had to quit his day job
Gnarles Barkley dropped "Crazy" to the web on purpose
That song was everywhere, even Foxy heard it
And Cassie and Latoya came on the scene
But I was too busy doin' my SHOULDER LEAN!
Lil' Kim came home from doin' a bid
Is it me or when she came out she was lookin' like Big?
Time to switch up, rappers took it there
Wyclef and Ludacris they all cut they hair
And your boy Ne-Yo went the baldie of course
But if you seen his hairline, he had no choice
Divorces got bad, and down right shifty
First Bobby and Whitney then K-Fed and Britney
And K-Fed, your rap career is through
Ron Artest almost sold more CD's than you
Nas said hip hop is dead
But Northern Caps spent all year tryin' to get New York back
Y'all need to lighten up some
The only time New York came back
Was on the Flavor of Love
And T. O . took pills try to get himself higher
But if you're like me you got hooked watchin' The Wire
Man, ?? should have looked over his shoulder
And we know 'cause we had the bootleg
Before the season was over
A lot of rappers got shot
And didn't shoot
Word on the street was they got dropped
By 'Cris and Snoop
Pharell and Kanye put "Number One" to work
You lookin' suspect 'Ye, button up that shirt
Y'all fools must be crazy
If y'all thought I was gon' forget about Lil' Wayne and Baby
I know y'all dudes for bein' flashy
But with y'all teeth, y'all kissin'
Now that's just nasty
Mel Gibson, he took a loss
Your record got no push son, if Jay-Z was your boss
To get a PS3, you had to hunt
And Snoop got the record for being arrested
Most times in a month
Beyonce said Dreamgirls was heaven-sent
But I heard that girl's been gettin' a breath mint
Her man Hov came back out
He was like "I'm so independent flex that I might buy a couch"
That's good business Jay, do that, yeah
Cause cops had two big records this year
Your boy Stout might advise you to go that route
'Cause everybody was BALLIN' and walkin' it out
Well not everybody really
Because A. I. is still BALLIN', he's just doin' it in Philly
Kramer dropped the N-word, dude is crazy
So Madonna, why don't you show him your new baby
Justin Timberlake brought "SexyBack"
Is it me or was he tryin' to get next to the blacks
We lost Dilla and Bradley and my man Proof
Gerald Levert, Big Phil and Professor X two
This a crazy world, hope it's better in heaven
Skillz signin' out y'all two thousand and seven, yeah!</pre>
