[Chorus]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'mma save her, yes, I Danny Glover
I'mma call her Papi 'fore I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
For that dope he whipped, you need a new wrist
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 1]
Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat
I got six cars and I also got rentals and all of 'em tinted
No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceiling
Stoner my lifestyle, I'm living too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hitting million dollar licks
Balling in New York like the motherfucking Knicks
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go, I gotta pass like staff
I'm going off top like a motherfucking lay up
357, six shots like Al
I left ten bands in a motherfucking cab

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I knew I was gonna run my money up and everybody didn't
All these niggas pussy niggas, telling on they partner
Hope the pussy nigga get a bigger sentence
Pussy nigga play, I'm coming back with the K
And I'mma shoot that motherfucker 'til he livid
Bitches wanna see a nigga thumb through his bands
I'ma name myself Young Thugga tenant
100 bands at a time
I fronted you bands, but you
I don't like using profanity but the Young Thugger will cut you
All of my cups are muddy
I fuck my bitches' buddies
I just want nut like Buddy
All of my bitches buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof
All the niggas dogs going, "Roof"
Top notch shawty, nigga we ain't gon' care
Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin then that bitch is only average
I can't even hear ya, baby, get rid of the static
I can't learn a bitch, but I learn mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern

[Chorus]</pre>
