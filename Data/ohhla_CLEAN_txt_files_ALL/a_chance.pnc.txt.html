First Verse [Kangol Slim]:

If I had a wish,
My wish, would be this,
You right in my arms, 
Even though I know I did you wrong,
So many flashback memories,
When we made love, you and me,
But I betrayed your trust,
And you love me oh so much

Chorus [Kangol Slim]:

Tell me do we have a chance, for our love?
(One time)
Do we have a chance, for our love?
Do we have a chance, for our love?
(Two times)
Do we have a chance, for our love?

Second Verse [Kangol Slim]:

There you are, lookin' so sexy and fine,
And I really wish I could make you mine again,
And I don't give a damn if you tellin' your friends
(He jockin' me)
When I think about the things that we went through,
You on me, me on you,
When I caught a slight joess,
You put money in my store,
And I don't know why I let you go, so

Chorus

Third Verse [Kangol Slim]:

Before I came home,
I called you on the phone,
You was lookin' at my picture sayin'
(Your hair done got long)
And you said you was ready for your man to come home.
(I miss you miss you)
But when I came in the World,
I started messin' round with a lot of girls,
And you told me that I broke your heart,
And that's what drove us apart,
But I'm here to tell you, the reason that I wrote this song,
Is because Girl yes, I know I did you wrong,
It's a livin' fact that I want you back,
You got me fiendin' like fiend when he fiend for crack,
You cooked and cleaned,
Did everything,
That's why I give you props, cuz you did those things,
When I came home, didn't have jackshit,
You the one that bought the tennis that fit, so

Chorus

Bridge One [Kangol Slim]:

There you are, lookin' so sexy and fine,
And I really wish I could make you mine again,
And I don't give a damn if you tellin' your friends
(He jockin' me)
There you are, lookin' so sexy and fine,
And I really wish I could make you mine again,
And I don't give a damn if you tellin' your friends
(He jockin' me)

Bridge Two [Kangol Slim]:

So look, what'cha gonna do?
It's either you gonna stay here wit'cha ol' scallywag friends,
Or you gone roll with me, what's happenin' with that?
(Well you know I just gotta see first, 
Cuz you know when you get wit'cha boys you don't know how to act, right?)
Well look at you.
It ain't even like that.  I ain't gonna sit here and act like I'm jockin' ya,
I'm just lettin' you know I like you
(We'll see)
Alright it's cool...
(Yeah, we'll see)

Bridge Three [Kangol Slim]:

If you got another man, 
I don't really give a damn,
You can tell him he could kite
(Boy you ain't right)
Because you comin' to spend the night,
And you know I do you right,
You can tell him he could kite
(Boy you ain't right)
If you got another man, 
I don't really give a damn,
You can tell him he could kite
(Boy you ain't right)
Because you comin' to spend the night,
And you know I do you right,
You can tell him he could kite
(Boy you ain't right)

Chorus

Bridge Four  [Kangol Slim]:

There will never be, another girl that do me the way that you do,
Wanna kiss you and hug you,
I love you I love you,
There will never be, another girl that can do me the way that you do,
Cuz I love you I love you,
Do you still care?</pre>
