[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, New York City, what up?
This is Staten Island ferry boat rider, man
Staten Island's Most Popular Son, Lounge Mode/Lo, bitch
Y'all talk to me now
2007, I'm the new slang Reverend
Holla at ya motherfucking yessa, man
Talk to me, huh?
Fee and Bis know what time it is
Y'all niggaz don't know shit
Let's go with it!

[Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, the block is hot, police is coming
I'm good money, no courtesy, the streets is pumping
And niggaz like to talk but they ain't eating nothing
Lingerin' Stone, been home and I don't feast for nothing
Bought a new gun for y'all dogs
Seen me on the road with Meth and Red? Then holla at ya frog
And if ya think it's been the holla with ya fault
And yes this shit is raw coming at ya door
You see, the hoods really make me laugh, they know what time it is
Staten Island's Most Popular, mom and dad
Had faith in the ghetto for once
Till niggaz wanna talk to the cops just to settle for months
Open house on a nigga ass, let go the trigger fast
Make sure dude dead, ditch him in the f'ing trash
Run in his crib, start to pick off his f'ing stash
And limp off nice like Keyzer when the cops pass

[Interlude: Lounge Lo]
Y'all niggaz is fake, y'all faggot motherfuckers, man
Yo, this Beez Mode, can't feel shit, man
So come and get me if you want me, I'm here now niggaz

[Lounge Lo]
The cops done came, some niggaz got locked
Post bail, pled guilty and decided on shops
Came back, bottled them tops with a lot of them rocks
Thinking twice why parole trying to stomp the gwop
Hodd niggaz wanted it a lot
Told cats back in the '90s and if they do it right they won't get popped
Seen a lot of niggaz come and go, some want to front on Lo
Look right through the nozzle, show you how to dump a blow
A blam off the damn blam, tell niggaz Lo
Been through the ghettoes and I do it for my kins folks
Y'all niggaz been jokes, and I been dope
Killah Hill or Guerilla, 10304
I'm Staten's best out, walk with my chest out
And one I didn't linger, so I guess it's left out
The hood hard as the most and I parted the toast
I'm Staten Island so you know I got darts on the boat

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
It's not a problem, man
It's not a problem, man
Y'all flames ain't hot enough, man
Talk with me
Walk with ya boy Simpson, man
Y'all know what we do on Staten Island, huh?
Yessa my lord, man
Yessa yessa my lord
Lingerin' Stone, the Stone Gang Beneeni
Y'all know what we do
Holla at ya yessa, boy
It's not a problem
Solomon Childs, I see you
Yessa yessa my lord
Bis, it's not a game
Ain't nothing changed, man
You and Fee, we gon' rock this again, man
60 Minutes up next, bruh
Holla at ya yes man</pre>
