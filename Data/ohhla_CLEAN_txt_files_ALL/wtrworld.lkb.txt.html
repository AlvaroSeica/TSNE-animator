Hurry, hurry, hurry, step right up and get your tickets
A waterride you won't soon forget
Experience of biblical proportions
Sorry, kid, you gotta be this high to ride this ride

[Tame One]
It might be seem dark having this drug related themepark
Till the fiends start to spark in between my recent remarks
With these thoughts, folks that's perfectly dry get kinda soaked
From this chemical dose, making you focus like microscopes
Out of all the stars, this the biggest dipper side of mars
With the signifcant difference in liquid and vented jars
My patronce is spacing, amazingly blazing this fragrent fragrence
My cadence got other dust patients lacin their statements
Waterworld, boys and girls relating to the vices
If you're wet your cigarette double as flotation devices
Amazing jars of ours got powers that last for hours
We devour leak and keep the streets wetter than aftershowers
Peep the liquid lace, basketcase, toxic waste
After taste, wet up half the ??? then concentrate to conversate
Sliding, slipping this narcotic product field trip
Take your chance, bring your fam, but warm 'em in advance

[Chorus]
Waterworld
One way ticket to drown in - Waterworld
Feet don't touch the ground in - Waterworld
Keep spiraling down thinking "Waterworld", "Waterworld"
Waterworld
Leak liters and pounds in - Waterworld
Deepsea underground in - Waterworld
Keep spiraling down thinking "Waterworld", "Waterworld"

[Cage]
My alarm clock telling me to suck his dick
I get up, see this bird in my bed like "I ain't fucked this chick"
No recollection of the club, just a plan to go
Usually wake up naked and bloody next to dead animals
Writing with a plague, lycan with a fade, cyph and minute maid
Would let my fist pound in your chest, might've been a blade
And the red guys are to follow when my arm release
So calm the beast like Khadafi when the US bombed his niece
Hell is almost here, life is fair, game sinners
High when I rip the plastic off the leak like airplane dinners
Don't wanna be in the ground, cremate me when I expire
Since I'm gonna burn in hell I should get used to the fire
Follow footprints of the dead that lead to the mourge
Gotta be dead or know the coronor to see us perform
You can't undo this, she was judas with teats
At every album mastering I'm thinking "posthumous release"

[Chorus]

[Tame One]
If a natural situation occures from getting high
Then put your head between your legs and kiss your dusted ass goodbye
The first, get you a cigarette to wet
And it's important that you listen to this angel dusted PCP endorsement
Tip the jar, dip the stove then remove the cot
This ain't weed, you ain't got no seads to stress like an adoption
Flame it up, blow it out, it tends to flare up
Be careful, I've done seen some people burn their facial hair up

[Cage]
Leak - The need is unstoppable, puff till my brain is inoperable
Ain't gonna quit cause I woke up in the hospital
The logical side of my brain should feel fear
But when I wake up every morning I'm like "Fuck! I'm still here"
I hacked a barcode into my arm, so
I could see how much I'm worth, this verse is paying my car, no
Habitual cynical at the pinnacle
Living through a pivital criminal giving you shit to listen to</pre>
