(K-Rino talking)
Uh!
Y'all should of knew this day was coming
We bout to get back G wit' it in H-Town, man
And all around the world

(Chorus)
I'm so confused
I can't tell the chicks from the dudes
I'm confused
I can't tell the chicks from the dudes
I'm so confused
I can't tell the dudes from the chicks
Cuz they walking around the city wearing the same outfits

[K-Rino]
Man, I thought you was a thug, certified wig splitter
Now you with your girlfriend picking dresses all griller
If you call yourself a gangsta you might wanna reconsider
Purchasing that pink shirt with them studs and that glitter
Females is getting hard while dudes is getting soft
While he tryna let his hair grow she cutting hers off
If you think you looking fly well that's your interpretation
Meanwhile that tight shirt is cutting off your circulation
You so fly that it's scary, I can't say it no clearer
In the bathroom with your wife fighting over the mirror
Y'all have switched up the game fo'real
Tell me what's the biz
Don't no women want a man who think he's cuter then she is
Fools taking bubble bath with aroma therapy candles
And if I see another dude wearing some sissified sandals
Talking bout they so comfortable, the air keeps the heat off
I'm a catch 'em by himself ambush 'em and chop his feet off

(Chorus)

[K-Rino]
These cats sweeter than glaze
Man, I hope it's just a phase
It didn't even reach this stage back in the El DeBarge days
I done let it ride too long so now they gots to pay
How you gangsta and you smelling like feminine bodyspray
Man, I'm tired of all these pretty rappers bragging about swagger
I'm a tag you with a jab that'll make a bull stagger
If the sun hit ya process your hair will probably melt
I can't believe you came around here wearing that superhero belt
I can't see you fitted like this masculine I'm maybe blind
Plus I thought jheri curls went out of style in 89
Do you dress like this to meet a girl and get on your jock
I like Michael Jackson too but ain't no glitter on my socks
For this punk trend to end, I just gotta hope and plead
Boy you're high maintenance like a janitor smoking weed
Born to lead cuz I'm bred from a gangsta ass breed
Straight up OG, product of a gangsta ass seed

(Chorus)

[K-Rino]
Real G's are becoming extinct like polar bears
These boys be wearing clothes a lotta women wouldn't wear
You was a Rasta mon, dreaded up blowing in the air
Now your whole hair is relaxed telling people it's baby hair
Man, I know a lotta streets you better never walk on
This dude is in the club with canary scarf on
With them flamboyant jeans looking like they from the 80s
Cell phone rung, his ringtone was "All My Single Ladies"
Your shirt is lime green, your shoes is suspect
Your face is moisturized, your hair passing your neck
Nothing wrong with getting fly, but nah, not like these folks
'I'm Forever' t-shirts, sweats, NIKES and black Loc's
Where you get them shades from?
Man, you elegant as a swan
At the Chinese nail salon getting your feet done
Some of y'all need gangsta rehabbing and pimp slaps
Is that a shirt or a tank top with two shoulder straps

(Chorus) 2x
