[Intro: Wale]
Um
No days off
Um
The Wizards played the Lakers today just so you know it's today 2010
Fuck it turn my mic up a lil bit
Yea

[Verse 1: Wale]
I be on my gramo no days off while I'm on
And I won't stop till I'm on that top and the whole world know me llamo
My name is Wale bitch rock nation affilliation
I race them then replace them more whips than a dominatrix
If I lost you be patient
Don't cross me like you athiest
And y'all late bitch while I'm cakin like the makeup on the geisha
O let's do it get-get your bitches scoot quick
And if she look good then I give her that wood like hacksaw Jim Duggan
Okay she rollin you wiped up but she go in
Can't tame her she's dangerous you ain't know she smashed the homies
Better keep that ho on a leash don't make your only
Treat a broad outside like I got five thou when I'm out y'all know I don't reach
DMV that's on me no days off I don't sleep
Rollin with my D-O-Gs I'm chiefin on some long beach
Folarin AKA young hip-hop and AKA you talk much and that AK have you zipped up
I'm fuckin witchu but I love them bitches you know I'm gettin more cut than nip tuck
And a nigga really don't need no slut unless I need a BJ like Bogut
(Yeah!) ha ha see I'm on my hoop shit
My buzz is like cocaine
Got a satchel for a roof face
Hung over till Tuesday witness what I do
Bag it-it inside that cool-cool but I'm a need you to filet
Cool straight done for now let's ride out shawty don't ask
Just gettin you a job then I zip that broad tryina get in them bars like ghost dad
Word to Rudy nigga I am I'll you is nothin but some EOs with no Gordon got trail
Did all my niggas loyal see we some different niggas
I heard you dogs talkin they Brian Griffin niggas
Ain't stalking no bitches though they always with a nigga
That's why I keep a couple Trojans here Lane Kiffin nigga
And my queen can have it all and that bitch don't get no dime or no time
Just a couple niggas in a boxcar that bitch go lime
Hold up y'all you know I'm fly I'm not jumping no 419
Took a shot jump to a porno star y'all really like I support that broad
Y'all all loafin goin through the motion hit me on the rock don't drop no cocaine
Y'all just bogus and y'all act focused y'all too old for this y'all Hulk Hogan
Y'all just think let me do my thing give them my time never give them my name
Never give them no rings never give them my keys unless a nigga got pound that thing-thing

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
Dats me fat trel DC northeast E Street all my niggas flock G-1
Ride around in a truck six deep everybody tote heat everybody blow tree uhh
Two middle fingers for the police if a nigga get killed no rat no cheese
In my city it's the other way around everybody know me everybody know Z
E Street bang everybody know me cus my eyes so gold and my eyes so green
And I smoke that dro so I move so slow like all I eba-eva-ever do is sip lean
Like Weezy I'll make it look easy bitches wanna fuck and the niggas wanna be me
Give my money up nigga nigga wanna see me fool almost had a heart attack when he see me
Old trap new E Street TV old strap new 50 shot magazine
Old head bitch with some big hips that I need to click like ain't 19
Bet I get it quick lick make it backflip outta town with some how you gonna act shit
Mad bitch mack lip she a actress have her in the coup suckin on the kick shift
High outer space no atlas got a lot of bait
No catfish

Send me automatic no practice I ain't gotta aim just shoot that bitch
Shoot till there ain't shit left in the clip
Bulletproof vest won't protect shit

And my niggas leave the jail like fuck this let's go home make a new hit list (Ha!)
