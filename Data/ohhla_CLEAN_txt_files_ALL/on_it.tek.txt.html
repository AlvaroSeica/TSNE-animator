Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 4X: Tekitha]
I, I be on it, on it, I, I be on it, on it
I, I be on it, on it, I, I be on it, on it
I, I be on it, on it, I, I be on it, on it
I, I be on it, on it, I, I be on it, on it

[Tekitha]
I'm on that hydroponic, my vision supersonic
Nigga, I can hear what I see, you need to get up on it
I utilize my logic, and turn it up on time it
Thought I wouldn't come for the smelling, nigga, forget about it
Cuz yeah, I've been around it, but you could see I"m grounded
I'm on the tar mack, growing, now you see me climbing
And you continue climbing, you see the economics industry
Act so it's often, it's need to realign

[Hook: Tekitha]
I'm on my square pivot, and shoot the J, 'diculous
Swish, and I'm rich, bitch, and you can't get with this
Pivot and shoot the J, 'diculous
Swish, and I'm rich, bitch, and you can't get with this

[Chorus 4X]

[Tekitha]
You stuck in zone neurotic, you think that's the alignment
You think you get to shine, you pop, lock and drop it
But I ain't never gold, and I'mma set upon it
And you can be on the side, and you'll be my opponent
I'm a machine chip, you can check my components
And if I slay a family member, then my condolence
I'm on that enterprise, I'm overseas and nice
Big steak, crab legs, and a seasoned rice

[Hook]

[Chorus 4X]

[Tekitha]
Just sit across seas, the paparazzi
Is looking at me, the way that I be
On it, yes indeed, simple and free
No bags to carry, the way that I need
On it, you can see, on it, yes indeed
The way I need, got you looking at me
On it, you can see, on it, yes indeed
The way I need, got you looking at me
Cuz I be on it, on it

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
