Song:   Spit Again
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Li-Mouse (Cno Evil)]
Where the fuck is my mic? -- Ah, here it goes (uh-huh spit again)
Aight aight, yeah, you ready (yeah) you ready (yeah
Aight (uh-huh, yo, spit again, yo, spit again, yo)
(Spit again just one more time) Spit again
(Spit again with one more rhyme) spit again
(Spit again just one more time) spit again
(Spit again with one more rhyme)

[Chorus 2X: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Spit again, just one more time (spit again)
Spit again, with one more rhyme (spit again)
Spit again, just one more line (spit again)
Spit again, with one more rhyme

[Cno Evil]
I flip Nazi's into mirrors, and make Manji's
Feel the spiritual wind, divine mind of Kamikaze
And I don't mean the ones from World War II
With those suicide attacks of the Japanese aircrews
I'm speakin' bout the typhoon, of 1281
That saved the Mongolian invasion of Kublai Khan
Either way, spray like a wave, wettin' your battleships
Penetration, from the force of the bombs that'll rip
Through your Navy, crack the cradle, that holds ya baby
Then make you walk the plank, pirate style, and steal ya lady
I snap like a turtle, runnin' fast over hurdles
I'll freestyle walkin' from Mamaroneck to Myrtle
You tell me that my rhymes complex, I don't care
I rhyme for myself, not for those out there
Won't simplify my lines, cuz you ain't prepared
My mic; my source of strength, like Samson's hair

[Chorus 2X]

[Li-Mouse]
Order Rodentia, Mus Musculus
Most other MC's know you couldn't fuck with us
Juicy, like the Australian fruit nonda
Only seen overhead like cams in your Honda
Increase horsepower, gallop to your devour
Lyrical content hits you with massive power
Trauma to your eardrums, your brain feels numb
Quickly find yourself, moving to these drums
Attract you, to move in large sums
Listen to this and see what you become
One with knowledge, tracks of hip hop scholars
Keeping headphones around your neck like collars
Trapped like .hack, give me a sign
Move violently that slip discs in your spine
Follower cats stand in one line, please
We stay alive through all seasons like pine trees

[Chorus 2X]

[Cno Evil]
It's him again, hip hop Vincent Valentine
Shoot 'em up, ammunition's mission to balance nines
I'm strugglin' to maintain control
Realizing with a new mind comes a new hope
Actin' upon options, preparing for the game
Start it up, select the best frame for ya brain
Confrontin' an entirely different breed of opponent
Smarter, more aggressive, a more organized Rodent
Deep in the Knight like Gladys, Tamias Striatus
With a bad bitch on my side, look like Trish Stratus
The sadness, causes wetness, slidin' down your cheek
Unstoppable leak, evaporates if you weak
Any day of the week, defeat you, in any country
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday or Sunday
On Wednesday is when I stay home and sharpen my sword
Saturday I throw darts, and battle on chessboards

[Outro: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Ya'll muthafuckas need to stop that shit, yo
Stop fronting like ya'll can rap
Fake ass DJ's trying to mix records and shit
Fuck that "It's DJ --" shut the fuck up, man
You never mixed a record in your life, right Mouse?
(Word, man) Fucking, fucking, "It's DJ --" shut the fuck up
(I'mma go get some food, fuck this) fucking, DJ
I'll mix your fucking face, man</pre>
