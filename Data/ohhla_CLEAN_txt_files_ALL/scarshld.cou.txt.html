[Boots Riley]
Drop it! Lock it!
Load it! Hold it!

Had a car with stuck doors and primer finish
To take a girl out I had to climb her in it
She really hoped her friends didn't find her in it
When she wanted two drinks, I said "Mind yer limit"
Show up at the party, new suit and Stacys
Very next day, return it back to Macy's
Say "It smells like sweat sir, is you crazy?
Gimme my refund or push up daisies!"
Me and two friends used to share a pager
So every three days I would swear I'm major
'lectricity from the next door neighbor
Broke motherfuckers be sharp as lasers
I was mo' to' back than a stolen car tag
Just used somebody else's card for the bar tab
A dollar hot dog wasn't nuttin to bark at
It's only funny cuz you don't see where the scar's at!!

[Chorus]
(Scars!) Hold that pose! {*repeat 3X*}
(Scars!) Hold it, smash it!

[Boots Riley]
Got free cable cause I know somebody
Got some broke potnahs that'll throw somebody
Not pickin up the phone cause I owe somebody
Got a twamp note I'ma photocopy
A date with me was all kinda fun
Go to the restaurant, dine and run
The bank might keep declinin 'em
But these hundred dollar checks, I'm signin 'em
The rubber on my sneakers used to flap when walkin
It looked like two little muppets talkin
"Ay, whassup baby? Do you come here often?
Oh, I got some new shoes - they haven't been brought in
This old ripped jacket is cause I am an artist
I'll burn rubber on you if my car will get started"
The third month avoidin landlords is the hardest
It's only funny cause you don't see where the scar is!!

[Chorus]

{*Tom Morello solo until 2:40*}

[Boots Riley]
Welfare checks, food stamps
Collection notes, broken amps
Paycheck late, shut off notice
Pyramid schemes, hocus pocus
Welfare checks, food stamps
Collection notes, broken amps
Paycheck late, shut off notice
Pyramid schemes are hocus pocus
Hold that pose {*3X*}
And don't ever come down
Hold that pose {*3X*}
And don't ever come down
Breakdown!!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Drop it! Lock it!
Load it!</pre>
