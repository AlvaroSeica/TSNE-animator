[Main Verse: Mr. Lil' One]
I was walkin' in the night, I met this cat named Satan
He wore a red shirt
Some Dickies and a cape, and
He said, "Your name is Uno, I been followin' your life
I see you settled down, you got some kids and a wife
I got a proposition
To better your position
I know you got some heat and wanna
Get out the kitchen"
I said, "Listen
Back the fuck up, you best to slow down
I know who you are
I been doin' good for months now
Leave me alone, what the fuck is goin' on"
He said that I owe him for the times he got me home
He said, "You got it wrong, Mister Child Of The Corn
Remember Lodi Dodi, drank
Three from The Sworn
It goes to your Condolences, they need to hear the Voices
Now go and load the musket, let me hear you say, 'Fuck it'
A pocket full of 'duck it'
Rememberin' your bucket
A finger on the trigger, all the bullets you were duckin'
The Boogieman, remember, named your album after me
If I wasn't there to guide you, where the fuck would you be
I gave you Walk Away, we was together, now you lame
We had each other's back like the 'nac and Alize"
Hey
"Wait a minute, dawg, now you comin' at me foul
You be pullin' my strings since I was a little child
You put me through some shit, had me walkin' in the dark
Now that I think about it, it was bullshit from the start
Did crimes cause of you
Did time cause of you
Lost my motherfuckin' mind a million times cause of you
It's over now, bounce, you no longer lead the way
I saw the true colors you revealed along the way
You didn't lead you could of, didn't do what you should of
And anything you asked of me, I bet you that I would of
They feed you
Be you
Resurrect and teach you
Save all the innocent souls
That you preached to
The death gave the karma, the pain and all the drama
Groupies and the fame, you can have 'em if you wanna
I feel my heart racin'
Back and forth, pacin'
Strugglin' to fight the situation that I'm facin'
Thought I see the light coming, left the things at ease
I told God 'Please,' I was weepin' on my knees
I heard ya loud and clear, just like daddy disappeared
To my women and my men, here's my prayer, AMEN" 

[Sam Hart]
(Verse 1)
Whisper in the wind
Like howling at the moon
So much left unsaid, my friend
The end came way too soon
Laughin' in the rain
Can ease the pain, if you let it drown you
None inside and foolish pride
Is built of walls around you
I never ever wanna be
I never wanna be the one
Trapped underneath the heavyweight
So much left undone

Chorus: Sam Hart
I wanna fly high
I wanna be free
I wanna be just like me
I wanna fly high
I wanna be free
I wanna be me

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Whisper to myself
Like praying in my sleep
Can't share with no one else
They're buried way too deep
Like dancin' in the sun
It's so much fun
Until it hurts you
Playin' God, weak facade
Your soul will overturn you</pre>
