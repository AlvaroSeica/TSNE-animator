Underneath the fridge
The top is holding leak
And the empty bags i've puffed
Have all become my pets

[Cage]
Leak Brother from another mother box cutter
But to discover I ain't missin it
So gutter I could jacuzz in my own piss and shit
No move is subtle, got a clip for you to cuddle, fag
Feet hands and head will get stuffed in a dufflebag
Tits - you ain't got enough to grab
First day out the pussy it was "blow me mom, fuck you dad"
High school to the hospital, hospital to me in the shelf
I'm so real, Chris Palko can't even be himself
Who the fuck wanna lead sheep out there, I head beneath them
After I'm coppin the bag like a dead police man
I go apeshit like digested bananas
In a world infested with cameras, got this flesh for piranahs
You want my spot but I abbandoned my veichle
Record labels are like bitches and none wanna be with you
Gun in my face, don't expect me to panic
I gave up on suicide, y'all have to take me off this planet
Weathermen pop out like a great white shark when it's snackin
I break your ribcage, and ask you what the fuck's crackin
this camp blood, and y'all get more than bearhug
And if you wanna stand next to this, bitch, wears blood
My head in the ground, my feet in the clouds
Bucket of Hoyson sauce, cross, then feed on the crowd
you got a part of me, it's a part of me every artery
That's filled with the rim with cells been on hell
Lookin to martyr me, fuck this my dick got infinite lives yet
It's my seads that constantly seem to find death
So if the pussy's a portal I crawl from in it
logically explains to you I am always in it
Science fickle, trickle, PCPeepin Tom
Embalmned, how to form pullin nostral hairs off your arm
About a thousand grains in each pyramid to the brain
In the nasal cavity, it's stargate to the plain</pre>
