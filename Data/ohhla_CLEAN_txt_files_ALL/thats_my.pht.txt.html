[Chorus]
That's my baby (uh uh)
Nobody has to know... just keep on da down low
Nobody has to know [x2]

[Verse 1: Lil Phat]
I wanna be yo juvy, buying me coogie, fuck da movies
Just give me yo booty, just roll my blunts up make sure dey smoking
And pour my drank up make sure it's pouring &amp; call my cake bay
After my show cause I'm yo baby so fuck dem hoes
Put me in da sassy, I'll let you drive me and bust dem legs back
Don't let them try me, be true to me &amp; I'll be true to you
And just be good to me cause I'll be good to you
No it ain't their business, bout what we doing
Fuck dey head up, let em' know who you skewing
Let dem know you done found dat new boo
So you know dem hoes hating on you,
Plus I got my money up too
So you know dem hoes hating on you (tell dem hate)...

[Chorus]
That's my baby (uh uh)
Nobody has to know... just keep on da down low
Nobody has to know [x2]

[Verse 2: Lil Phat]
Nobody gots to know, we can keep it on da low
But when you tell one of yo friends, believe dat everybody gone know
I'm busting, I'm cuffing, I love when we fucking,
She got it, I got it, dey hating, they liking it
No fighting, no fussing, no trippen, no cussing
We kiss and we hug, my baby and true love
Baby! dem hoes gone hate so let dem hoes say what dey gone say
You ain't crazy, you know why dey be all in my face
And I'm like baby... dey out da picture

If you ever need me you can call me
Cause I come and get cha... I hit dat rode to da show
She like I'm coming with ya, she by my side (by my side)
We stick together(we stick together)
Like a goon(like a goon)
And a snicker... behind me ha honey, she buy whatever
Angel sent from heaven, thanks for putting us together!

[Chorus]
That's my baby (uh uh)
Nobody has to know... just keep on da down low
Nobody has to know [x2]
