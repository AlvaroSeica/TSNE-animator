[Ronnie Spencer]
Put the guns down, and take a look around
Brothers robbing and killing, haven't we had enough now
Sister love your mother, cherish her like no other
When things in life ain't going right, she'll be right by your side

[Hook]
Brother brother, stop fighting each other
Sister sister, love your mother
What's going on, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on

[Ronnie Spencer]
Living in the lowest level, or should I say the ghetto
Living lavage, taking chances, struggling to live fabulous
Our children, are the ones that suffer
Being raised, by a single mother yeah

[Hook]

(*Al-D talking*)
Man, there's a war going on, that's right
Many soldiers are dying (dying)
But you know the real war is here
In the city streets (in the city), are we victims of society
We really need to focus on unity, now that's real

[Ronnie Spencer]
Pushing that ki, pushing that steal
Pushing our lives (ooooh-ooooh-ooooh-I)
Everybody, get on your knees and pray
Living in the last days, we need to make a change

[Verse 4]
My partnas dropping like flies
And every other day, another on dies
Is it the drugs, or the glitter in our eyes
Protect all my brothers, sisters and friends
All the ones out hustling, and the ones in the Penn
Gotta survive in this life, only God in our minds
In this country that was built through crime, stay on your grind
Till it's your time to shine, put it down and help another
To fill the ghetto dreams, respect and love your brother

[Hook - 4x]</pre>
