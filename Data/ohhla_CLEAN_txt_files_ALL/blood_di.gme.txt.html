[Game]
Jacob sold me my first couple pieces
I was killin niggaz who misunderstood what deceased is
Spent half a mil' on a Ferrari, I coulda leased it
Drivin Scott Storch's Bugatti 'fore they released it
Drop "The Documentary" rockin khakis with creases
Dope and hip-hop, it resurfaced with some leeches
Ten times platinum, now I'm chillin where the beach is
Time to show the world what a motherfuckin beast is
Blanca, bullet-proof cars in Sri Lanka
12 years old, on his shoulder a rocket launcher
10,000 miles away, there's an owner of a corner store
A white man walks in spit shinin his Audemar
While somewhere in Africa, Jo-Burg and Congo is goin to war
Rebels enslavin they own people, diggin water or
Get murdered cause that choppa is a carnivore
He found one and stole it, now the village tryna find that boy

[Chorus 2X: Game]
Blood Diamonds
Look at Blood Diamonds
Blood Diamonds
Now take a look at Blood Diamonds

[Game]
How you sellin the shit our people is diggin fo'?
Diamonds, cotton, that belong to niggaz though
LeBron and Durantula gave America a look at gold
And what you give us back, is another fuckin liquor sto'
And we need blunts, so we walk in that muh'fucker
Money in the safe, so we in that muh'fucker
But you can't forget the tape, tryna pin a muh'fucker
DEA ain't got a case, I'ma win that muh'fucker
And it ain't about the Chinese dude, I eat Chinese food
Where you think Michael Jordan find these shoes?
We robbin each other for 'em, think I should hide these jewels?
Run up on you in broad day with them Siamese tools
But nah, Mandela did 28 straight
without a fuckin complaint, put a afro on a saint
Put a wig on a judge, put a nigga in some chains
Over change kill him, lethal injection inside his VEINS

[Chorus] - 1/2X

[Game]
Brutus killed Caesar (Caesar)
And Judas killed Jesus (Jesus)
John Wilkes Boothe killed Lincoln
And you thought he freed slaves, what the fuck was you thinkin? (thinkin)
Nigga fuck Lincoln
I'm rollin up kush in my Lincoln, now let it sink in
Rolled against Obama now you divin in the deep end
I'd rather take my chances at this water fountain drinkin
Where the fuck is the loyalty? Knock these niggaz fuckin teeth in
In the hood singin like they Aubrey or The Weeknd
Pull that towel from under that do', and let it seep in
It's a lot of shit +I Don't Like+ so bring Chief Keef in
I don't like these phony ass jewelers with that fake shit
Overchargin niggaz an arm and leg just to make shit (shit)
And you wonder why we take shit
Y'all put us on slave ships, that's the reason we HATE shit
Rob our own niggaz for them
