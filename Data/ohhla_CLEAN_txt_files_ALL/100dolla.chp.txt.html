Typed by: AZ Lyrics

They call me chip tha rip
I got somethin big on my hip my hip
Hoes get off my dick dick dick dick
Now dip o shit I forgot to tell you SLAB in this bitch this bitch
You should already know that
Dream team I'm gonna show you niggas how we do
Polo ev zues paid 700 for the jeans boo
Karate chop the top off that chevy caprice
To bring that breeze through
Not a skateboarder but I wear DC shoes
Why? cause I'm on the grind sippin that hen til the bottle gone
I tell hoes I'm broke but really I'm a walkin bank take out a loan
I'm outa town makin that dough but
When I get home I'm gonan make yo bitch hit high notes you can't hit with a xylophone
Ya'll niggas is hollerin
Ya'll really don't need to packs
200, 000 grams ya'll wouldn't know what to do with that
I'm gon hussle till I got 100 dolla bills hangin outa my booty crack
Ha how cool is that

I'm a get my dough
I'm a get my bread
100 dolla bills are worth a lot more than your head
I'm a get my dough
I'm a get my bread
100 dolla bills are worth a lot more than your head
I'm a get my dough
I'm a get my bread
100 dolla bills are worth a lot more than your head
I'm a get my dough
I'm a get my bread
100 dolla bills are worth a lot more than your head

I'm gon get that dough

I'm tryin to get back home
I'm from stump a motha fucka out avenue
Better known as st claire
Want me come get me
I'll let em off till the whole thing empty
You can believe it or not like ripley
I give a nigga fifty so don't temp me
Big body mazzarati

Whoop outa all the niggas dat do dis shit my city pinkney
Yeah this rap shits cool but I shoot a nigga before I let a nigga dick me
Strong man iron man yeah I am the nigga that can lift up 800, 000 grams with one hand
Got matchin dolce and gabbana lotes papas
So if you one a dem niggas that's hatin
For some reason I can't see it

I'm a get my dough

100 dolla bills are worth a lot more than your head
