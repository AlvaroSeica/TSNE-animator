[Intro]
Kiss your eyelids and awaken now, one two go

[Verse One: Eligh]
When I crack open my eyelids in the morning
First thin on the mind is my carnage
I ran through in a dream state is an island
I need coffee to get off it
Hockin up phlegm, spit it off my balcony
With a cigarette pursed between two fingers in a right hand
Alchemy edging me revisit in subconscious minutes
Spittin intense incidents accidents and coincidence mental blockades
Opened up for thought traffic to flow freely like the autobahn
Phenomenon mano y mano cuss like verses
The present is just potholes in my lawn
Beyond the B-rated porno flick, this man here is sick
And if you could see my dreams first hand you'd think I was a lunatic
The thing is this, when I was an active addict
I preferred the dream world but now that I'm clean I like the real world
Steel pearls drop like rain, the gift of pain I learned to love it
I yearned the covets of love and put nothin above it
Tough luck for a man who got a brain who tells him to get shit daily
So I go through nightly melees in my mind like Israelis
with AK's pointed out the windows of Mercedes
Am I crazy? Undercurrent runnin through stargates
It's my fate to awaken tired soaked in perspiration
but my sweat smells delightful
The light I blast out the lighthouse I live in is light years ahead so trip

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Trippin into this I say I feel like life is fake
It's all these dreams I've fallen into, life is better not awake, I'm

[Verse Two: Reverie]
Please tell me is this real?
Am I sleeping, dreaming? So intriguing
When I step into the clouds, high off writing, igniting sounds
I clown on cowards quick to devour, power
Anythin that can be used for reimagining our, world
in another state of mind may they shine
All the stars in the sky give the ideas in my mind
I'm inclined to daydream, teachers awake me
Mistake me, but the people that are concentrating
Only if they knew what I envisioned
Spaceships up in planets on an astronautic mission
Not restrictin the creativity, flowin deep within to me
Enemies cannot enter this realm of livity
They are sentenced elsewhere, open minds here are vital
So listen to the riddles I recite in my recitals

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
