[Spirit]
Yeah
You oughta think we could flip it like this
Hah
Well, we did, baby
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Spirit]
Might say Face, but hit me on Twitter
Tweetphoto, MyPic, send me your picture
You could be my mistress, I can be your mister
You can bring your friends
Because it ain't your sister
Big Tank Boss, O.G. Kid Frost
Some of the realest peeps you will ever come across
We do it for la raza, homey, que pasa
My people come first
Without that means nada
They call me Spirit cause I can't be touched
I'm liftin' heavy weights, so
Get your balls up
Look me up on YouTube, if you need a visual
I collect checks
Call them Residuals (Ha)

Hook: Gangreen
"He rocks in the tree top
All-a-day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singing the song"
"He rocks in the tree top
All-a-day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singing the song" --&gt; Bobby Day

[Verse 2: Frost]
I Wanna Rock right now
I'm the O.G. and I came to get down
I originated and created new sounds
I'm the Godfather, the brim is my crown
And I'm internationally known
I travelled the world, but L.A. is my home
I get so much love, all my people retweet
Scoop DeVille, that's my son on the beats
I lead a lifestyle most people can't dream
My right hand man, Big L.A., Gangreen (Ugh)
I put it down since the 80's
You can try your best, but you still can't fade me

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3: Big Tank]
I'm on MyTwit-Face-Space, MyTwit-Face-Space
MyTwit-Face-Space, come visit MySpace
Big Tank Boss, tell me what you think
Down low, press play, music for the streets
My social network, tied together, all linked
Street life, hoo-bangin', lethal on the beat
Car show weekend, keep it on the D and
Tweet pic, yeah, little mama be teasin'
And if you on Facebook, hit the Like button
You could look at all my photos, see I ain't frontin'
Girl, take a picture
You look so good, I wanna kiss ya
Ugh

Repeat Hook

[Verse 4: Tino Cochino]
Ladi Dadi
I'm on Bacardi
Coke and Hennssey gives me faded memory (Hey)
Higher than a treetop, candy paint, drip drop
When Tino's on the track, they hit the certified charts
Cochino means nasty
Baby, I'm a freak-freak
Come and see the naked little birdie go tweet-tweet
Listen to the voice (Voice)
Recognize my style (Style)
I do this for the woman cause I love to make 'em smile (Hello)
This is history, from Cali to south Texas (Whoo)
Somethin' you can jam in your Regal or your Lexus (Hey)
This is how I live, baby, this is how I do
'95 Eastside, we ride a Rendezvous
True
