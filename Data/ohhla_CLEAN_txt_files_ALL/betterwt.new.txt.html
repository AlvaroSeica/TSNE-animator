[Chorus 1: Chris Brown]
You're a dime, so beautiful
Top of the line, so unusual
Words can't define, been runnin through my mind all day (daaaay, daaaaay)
I'm so happy you're mine - (So beautiful)
Top of the line - (So unusual)
Now I think it's time - Hey, shawty 
I hope you don't take this the wrong way

[Chorus 2: Chris Brown]
Girl, you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off
Oooooooooooooooooh-oooooooooooooh 
Girl, you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off
Oooooooooooooooooh-oooooooooooooh
(Baby girl, you better with the lights off)

[Legacy]
(Oh) Hey Miss America 
(Oh) what you look so sad for?
Sweetheart, you only live one time
So put your fantasies on fast forward
Life, gon' speed me up
Got a deadline, 'cause you need me time
I hate yo' type, I love you too
I bite yo' swag cause I wanna do, you!
Huh~! Cain't blame me, babe
Obama you work clothes, girl make a change
to your, lingerie, right like that
That la-la-lah make ya eyes roll back
...I mean, you already fine though
I just wanna see you with the lights off
Every guy wanna know how it is
to clap off the lights and turn Khloe to Kim

[Chorus 1 + 2]

[Ben J]
Ugh~! Drive off, take my girl to have a nice day
She was right so I let her hang my way
You look cute, girl what'chu wanna do, girl? 
Drive to my house, 'cause it's only me and you, girl
I'm checkin her out, she had to put her swag on
Actin too happy, sayin she ain't goin back home
I'm like, "Wow, whatever you say
but whatever you plan, gotta be done at 8"
Next stop -- party at my place 
Of course you welcome girl, you ain't takin up space
We get there, but shawty STILL lookin right
She attacked me, but wait let me dim the lights
Oh you look different, she like, "Boy, stop it!"
Naw, I ain't playin, actually you more poppin
She said, "Shocking, no that's really raw"
All over baby, even with the lights off

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2 2X]</pre>
