Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I want to welcome you to my I Forgive You mixtape
Lil B - love of bullshit on my mind
I'm just tryna stay alive and be positive, uplift
Show love to where I come from

This shit brings tears to my eyes cause it's like
Fuck these niggas man!
That's on life, nigga

[Verse: Lil B]
My inside's burnt up, I'm tore up from the weed smoke
My vision out of place, I'm a hunter
I got the fiends going, literally, not mentally
I'm on another note, the last time I've seen some real friends
Was on the TV show, and when I was going break
They always had their comments
Leave you in the dirt and hit you where it hurts
But a man like me, I'm a work on the nightshift
Work on the graveyard even if I never sleep
The American dream is to die self-made
The rich stay rich and the poor eat the grains
Now that's where the root and the source of all my pain
I was born into war, I don't want to die in a flame

Listen, just listen, you can heard it in the system
I forgive you for your thoughts
It's hard to see wisdom, when you're a 5, you're not thinking 10
You're not seeing 7, you're not even 6
And I guess you kind of pissed cause most niggas staying under
I forgive your hate, I sit back and wonder
Life's really hard but I move through the thunder
I keep my head up, I step my bread up
The money came in to me cause a brother stopped chasing
Quit being so thirsty, no off back hating
No random car rides with the fiends to go shopping
I was stealing that night, I was dealing that night
But plotting by day, I still live in paranoia
Even still to this day, I can't believe I'm not folded
They not planking in the Bay where I'm from
Cause this is not a game and they got real guns
I forgive you for your ignorance, not paying attention
To the message that I'm giving, to say I'm never sitting
That means that I'm not sick and I been down since the beginning
With a cough and a limp, warm hand and cold lips nigga
This little boss
And I'm thinking about the tat
Cause the squad showed me hate
But I don't got to relax
I gotta relax, actually, I need to relax
But I got the respect, I forgive you at last
Take the money out the car, put my soul in the bag...</pre>
