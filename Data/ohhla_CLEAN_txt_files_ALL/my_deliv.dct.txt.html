Song:   My Deliverer
Typed by: alcatrazz_iz_crazy_4_god@yahoo.com

Joseph took his wife and child
And they went to africa
To escape the rage of a deadly king
There along the banks of the nile
They listened to the song
That the captive children used to sing
They were singing...

[Chorus]
My deliverer is coming
My deliverer is standing by
Oh, my deliverer is coming
My deliverer is standing by

Through a dry and thirsty land
Water from the kenyan heights
Pours itself out of lake sangra's
Broken heart, its broken heart
There in the sahara winds
Moses heard the whole world cry
For the healing that would
Flow from god's own scars
I hear moses singing

[Chorus]

He will never break his promise
He was written it upon the sky
My deliverer is coming, Oh, my deliverer is standing by

He'll come 'round
He'll come 'round some day
(just like he said he would)
(repeat 2X)

I will never doubt his promise
Though I doubt my heart
Though I doubt my eyes

[Chorus]

Standing by, oh he's standing by [5X]

Oh, deliver me, deliver me</pre>
