[PHONTE]
I cant sleep at night
Cause they wont see me 
Running from the daylight 
To where she keeps me 
And when the sun rises she watches over me

Waiting for the daylight cause then she'll keep me
In the safety of her arms
She never leaves me
And when the sun rises she watches over me

And when the sun rises she watches over me

[MUHSINAH]
He tells me all his secrets he thinks nobody knows
We lay together in daylight 
I love him so
And when the sun rises he watches over me

And when the sun rises he watches over me

[PHONTE]
Its not like it
Was before
And she cant keep me
Anymore
She loves me
Anymore
She loves me 
Anymore

[MUHSINAH]
He tells me all his secrets
He thinks nobody knows
We lay together in daylight 
I love him so
She loves me (*8X*)

And when the sun rises he watches over me

And when the sun rises he watches over me

-Break-

[MUHSINAH]
Why dont you stay here with me
I pray that our morning won't leave
Let me keep you
Then youll see
Dont hide the truth from yourself
Its you that i'll love and protect
Let me keep you here with me

[PHONTE]
Its not like it
Was before
And she cant keep me anymore
She loves me
Anymore
She loves me 
Anymore

[MUHSINAH]
He tells me all his secrets he thinks nobody knows
We lay together in daylight i love him so
She loves me (*8X*)
And when the sun rises he watches over me

And when the sun rises he watches over me</pre>
