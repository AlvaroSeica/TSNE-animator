[will.i.am]
I went asleep last night, tired from the fight
I've been fighting for tomorrow, all my life
Yea I woke up this morning, feeling brand new
'Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
has finally came true

It's a new day...
It's a new day...
It's a new day...
It's a new da-aaaa-aay...
It's a new day, it's a new daa-ay

It's been a long time coming 
Up the mountain kept runnin'
Songs of freedom kept humming
Channeling Harriet Tubman
Kennedy, Lincoln, and King
We gotta manifest in that dream
It feels like we're swimming upstream
It feels like we're stuck in between
A rock and a hard place 
We've been through the heart-aches
And lived through the darkest days
If you and I made it this far 
Well then hey, we can make it all the way
And they said, "No, we can't," and we said, "Yes, we can"
Remember it's you, and me, together

I woke up this morning, feeling alright
I've been fighting for tomorrow, all my life
Yea, I woke up this morning, feeling brand new
Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
has finally came true

It's a new day, it's a new day
It's a new day, it's a new day
It's a new da-aaaa-aay...
It's a new day, it's a new daa-ay

It's been a long time waitin, waiting for this moment
itÂ´s been a long time praying, praying for this moment
We hope for this moment, and now that we own it
For life I'ma hold it, and I won't let it go
This is for fathers, our brothers 
Our friends who fought for freedom
Our sisters, our mothers
who died for us to be in this moment
Stop and cherish this moment
Stop and cherish this time
It's time for u-nity
For us, and we 
That's you, and me together

I woke up this morning, feeling brand new
'Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming
Finally came true
Yea, I woke up this morning, feeling alright
'Cause we weren't fighting for nothing
And the soldiers weren't fighting for nothing
No, Martin wasn't dreaming for nothing
And Lincoln didn't change it for nothiiiiing
And children weren't crying for nothi-iiiing

It's a new day, it's a new day
It's a new da-aaaa-aay...
A new day, it's a new day
It's a new day, it's a new daa-ay</pre>
