[Verse 1]
I'm bout to get my dick wet, on the pill
I don't give a fuck, I'm a keep it real
In my zan with that lean in that fuckin spot
Smokin kush blount all day and night [Juice x4]
I never gave a fuck because I made swag
Niggas talkin shit, but they think they bad
Coming with the juice, that my new shit
2 bentleys, 2 lambos, I'm the truth bitch
I never gave a fuck, I'm from simpson road
Niggas hatin on me, cause I'm bout to expload [Ka-Boom]
I'm with Tonio in iceberg. Suck my dick bitch

[Lil B]
Bitch hoe, bitch hoe, I'm a bitch hoe
