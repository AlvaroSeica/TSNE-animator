[Intro]
Thanks for choosing Arby's
Would you like to try one of our brand new toasted subs?
That's right Arby's now has toasted subs
Would you like to try our brand new jalapeno bites with bronco berry sauce?
That's right, we now have jalapeno bites with bronco berry sauce
Your total is five dollars and, thirty-seven cents
Please pull around

We're like two cakes, two potato cakes
We're like two cakes, two potato cakes
We're like two cakes, two potato cakes
We're like two cakes, two cakes

[mc chris]
She not allergic to nerd urgin but she's shy to serve it
I'm so bitter bout shit, she gives me a lift and I'm nervous
See we both work at Arby's, but in separate sections
And she doesn't know I like her that she gives me erections
She's up at the counter, I'm in the hole in the back
Taking orders, making change, puttin toys in the bags
We smoke butts on occasion, and I really can't stand it
But she's from another planet so I deal like I'm Gambit
Smoke breaks are like dates, so I don't mind the coughin
But I'd rather get blazed with the cook in the walk-in
But I feel like I'm stalkin, I can tell she's uneasy
Not appeasing to be creeping so I still hold her cheesy
At the end of the night, I'm sure to ask for a ride
Been a really long day, I feel like dying inside
Feel like driving all night, home life's kind of fucked
Never dropped me off, never rolled the window up
What?

[Chorus]
We're like two cakes (we're like two cakes)
Two cakes, two potato cakes (two cakes, two cakes)
We're like two cakes (we're like two cakes)
Two cakes, two potato cakes (two cakes)
We're like two cakes (we're like two cakes)
Two cakes, two potato cakes (two cakes, two cakes)
We're like two cakes (we're like two cakes)
Two cakes, two potato cakes (two potato cakes)

[mc chris]
Up at 6:30, take a shower cause I'm dirty
Go to school, keep on flirting with this girl I think is purty
Yeah I know she's gonna hurt me but it's worth it I assure it
She's so perfect, I'm so putrid, where is Cupid and some courage?
I will love her always, torment in the hallways
Treated like a cretin, something creeping in your crawl space
See her at the lockers, see her knockers in her sweater
Soon she'll find the letter where I go ahead and tell her
She's like, "I'm so stoked, I got a date to the dance!"
Well there's a girl from art class, that I guess I could ask
"You should go, we could double, there's a really big party
Oh by the way, I've got good news, I finally quit Arby's
I'm a hostess at Chili's, and it's really the bomb
My date's a waiter there, it's where he asked me to prom"
And so I linger on with my pale blue eyes
Walkin through the hood cause I've lost my ride

[repeat 2X]
This job is alright, as far as fast food goes
Free grub is a perk, but the benefits blow
If the manager's cool we get to chief in the store
Turn the stereo on, while we sweepin the floor
Well the jocks they know I work here and they recognize my voice
Throw empties at my window but that's beside the point
It's a minimum wage, it's a bit of a pain
But every jerk was worth it cause her beautiful face

[mc chris]
And so I survive, I'm prepared to do prep
I'm sweatin by the ovens, someone turn on the vents
What a turn of events, now I'm sort of a mess
There's a new girl she retarded, now the manager's tense
The cook's out of weed, and I kinda miss it
But I still show up for work like this shit is no big
Like my heart is not broke, like she done me no harm
I don't wanna be a wuss so I still set my alarm
I'm upset but not emo, and there's no one to fight
I can block the empties with a shield like I'm prototype
Close the window to the world if it's not actin quite right
Pack the pipe in the parkin lot with manager Mike
I can deal with this shirt, I got really cool bosses
I can stock the desert, I can marinade the sauces
It's scary but awesome, when it comes to my job
I never even think about the time I was robbed {*gunshot*}
