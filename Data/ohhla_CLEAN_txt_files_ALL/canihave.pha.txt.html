Ladies and Gentlemen
Yes'ir
Lets do it
Yes'ir
Hot...Yo

[Verse 1]
On and on and my nuts I'm palmin'
Take two of these and call me in the mornin
You should see the way the chain harness the charm and
Fly I'm +Like a Bird+ like Nelly Furtado
Shit, pop your bottles, toast and scream cheers
Get your two step cause this the record of the year
Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, 2 for a pair
Officially announcing this is Warfare cuz
Back in the day, my clouds was Grey
And it seemed liked my angels couldn't blow them away
But then I sold my first verse and copped that NSX
But I was still ridin in them dead ass jets but now
Man my vision so clear out the window of the Leer and I'm
Talkin on my celly all the shit that you should hear
Listen clearly now.... Hello? Can you hear me now?

[Chorus]
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)
And act like you tryin' to get this money right quick
So Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)

[Verse 2]
On and on and this beat is on and 
I control their mind from straight over the phone
Let 'em explore the words, something like a tourist
And never get addicted unless that heady-wop is serious
(Yes'ir)From Louisville to Jimmy Choos he's real
She know the time, she see the Richard Mille
Plat- double skeletal, Tourbillion
It just like her body move, it turns her on
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers
And all our car doors go up like +Transformers+
See I can do it this-a-way, I can do it that-a-way
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway
So(WOO!)cool it like +New Edition+ unless you hot as you say
I get it ok, let it ball away
But PLEASE run along, because LADIES is feelin' wrong
And I got something right for them right after this song
My name is Skate...Board...P
Ladies and Gentlemen...

[Chorus]
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)
And act like you tryin to get this money right quick
So Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)

[Verse 3]
On and on and, the temperature is warm and
I spit heat flashes, niggaz get nauseous
Bright as a bitch, so analyze with caution
When the light hit the ice, bet 100 that you vomit
And should I mention the fact my Transition is the track
New accession to the vision just to get me where I'm at?
Huh. Little Skateboard, (Come on)he too grown
Ridin' up and down Collins in that that new Two Tone
It's so cold, you don't wanna feel the chill of it(Uh)
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it(Uh)
I don't smoke but I bet the sensanel of it 
Totally intensifies the vivid ass appeal of it
You can be jealous, and grit you teeth (Uh huh)
But all these little niggaz got somethin in reach
So...You want heat? These niggaz can front heat
While I'm on my boat party, tryin' to Sunseat
My name is Skate...Board...P
Ladies and Gentlemen

[Chorus]
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)
And act like you tryin to get this money right quick
So Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
(You got it like that)
Hot...
Hot...
Hot...</pre>
