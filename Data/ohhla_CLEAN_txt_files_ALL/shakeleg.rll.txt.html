(ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together
for William Tecqwyn!)

[Wiley]
(eski boy, shake a leg, shake a leg)
oi! dan! wot you call this?
why have you got me spittin on this?
I don't usually spit on tracks like these
but its jus the start and I'm startin to like it
watch producers try and buy me
If you like it
don't fight it
dance with your grandma
Ill be dancing with your auntie
[Skippa] (but I bet your uncle cant wait for the switch!)
now I move onto your girlfriend
me dancing with your girl
now thats hell friend
I get randy
do you know whatd handy
a little glass of brandy
now I'm skankin with big daves mandy
shakin a leg in the middle of the dancefloor
I'm givin her what she asks for
she got a hardback wind what more can she ask for

[Chorus]
come and shake a leg with me
p-p-p-p-please shake a leg with me
oi!
come and shake a leg with me
oh-oh-oh-oh-please shake a leg with me
whoa!

(ladies and gentlemen, lets have a warm welcome
for our next performer, Jose Fernandez)

[Skippa] (skippa, esta loca, oh! hola! ok)
this is loco flow too
got a spanish flow to wiggle ya toe to
come, shake ya leg for a giggle
grab ya keys up, I got a knees up to go to
tap shoes black shoes any clapped shoes
going for the nachos and the free booze
In a shirt you nicked off rodrigo
roll tight in a nylon tuxedo
red hot chilli peppers, hot jalepenos
mamas in hotpants tighter than speedos
left, right, backward, forward we go
lambada with a chica, spittin I'mage of deebo
I do the salsa with the old fogies
eatin runny guacomole green like bogies
I'm litsenin to the sounds and I don't mind neither
shakin a leg with a funny old geezer

[Chorus]
come and shake a leg with me
p-p-p-p-please shake a leg with me
oi!
come and shake a leg with me
oh-oh-oh-oh-please shake a leg with me
whoa!

(ladies and gentleman, will you please put your hands togther
for the Ethnal from Bethnal)
scratchy - (scratch, eiiiii, eiiiii)
wot?
this sounds like the job for me
the ethnal from bethnal shakin a l-e-g
which l-e-g
third l-e-g
yeah! I'm a wrong'un
known to be a liberty
like him. I cant see me sittin on this
but I like music so I'm spittin on this
you chose me to come and spit all over this one
and then have a little wander around and get drunk
woteva the weather I make bars make cheddar
drive cars with leather
so don't ask whos clever
(whos clever?)
we're clever
and I'm clever, hes clever shes clever
(smart)
and shes out and about with no fella
and ive had a couple of stella I feel leathered
now shes over the moon, shes up weather
shes one on for the big style wheneva
she makes me feel betta!

[Chorus]
come and shake a leg with me
p-p-p-p-please shake a leg with me
oi!
come and shake a leg with me
oh-oh-oh-oh-please shake a leg with me
whoa!</pre>
