[Intro - Sampled from "Signs"]
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed
by a forty-two year old - Romero Valadares
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's seventh birthday
In the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil. It was sent to the local news bureau there
and sent to us by a sattelite just a few minutes ago
All initial opinions are; this is genuine

What you are about to see, may disturb you..

[Verse 1]
Murder forensicles, surrounded by alternative tentacles
Extra-terestials step out of starships in pressure-suits
Claiming humans were created inside of test-tubes
Horryfing with huge eyesockets recemble headwounds
Pumpin the protoplasma, jello-like substance
Lookin like goldblum in The Fly, but more dusted
Don't trust their reptilian tounge
They come in peace is what they claim
When their true intentions are to have the world in chains
Said, they came from beyond the stars, unexplenable
Religious people thought they coming was a sign from God
They thought these were the Eloheem
When the first mothership arrived over the planet, it was a creepy scene
A huge hovering metal structure stretching for over 5 miles every direction
Blocking perception, every news channel, 24 hour-coverage stopping commercials
Doctors, experts, UFO's, crop-cicles, arguing generals in closed doors-meetings
Religious cults claiming to know the meaning of these beings
Many of these cults claimed to have been abducted
Probe-prodded and fistfucked and caught in the tractor-beam and lifted up
- Into the lab, strap you to tables, made you endure
Series of tests, pushin beyond the limits of stress
Wakin up in a cold field naked, barely alive
Every inch of your body's in pain, you barely survive
Milleniums ago, starmaps were drawn to sand
The meanings of the pyramids has long tortured man
Pharoahs and Hebrews, Mayans and Aztecs
Mathemetically perfect architects the many gods have blessed
Hieroglyphics become the blueprint of primal physics
Pyramids buried kings screams, tribal clerics
Radar-signals from space bouncing off burnt rocks
