Hook:
Hootches need love too
You know we gotta have it
Yeah hootchies need love too
Hootchies need love too
Yeah you know we got to have you know we got to have it
Groove with me

Verse 1:
So you're trippin' cause I'm a little rougher than you're use to
I ain't the one you act a fool to
Step to me wrong and I'm a snap your neck
Put your hoe in check and if you take another step (gun cocking)
Back in the day if I remember
Truely you had the hicky for a hootchie now you're frontin'
When ya knew me and you know a hootchie ain't a hizzoe
That's why you gotta gizzo
But really you don't hear me though 
But anyways I ain't trippin' so don't you slip
Cause I'm dippin' cause sucka you ain't pimpin'
Uh you gotta step to a hootchie with a little mo game 
On your tongue or your ass will get hung
And I don't need a father figure
Daddy dearest trying to nut up put your game up
Or shut the fuck up
And about that little tramp you supportin'
You starin' me down but I'm the hootchie you was shortin'

Hook

Verse 2:
Everybody's out to diss a hootchie but don't even front
Just light up a blunt you got to groove me to step to me 
Ooh we ooh we do he want me 
Or is he just a freaky brother fiendin' for some booty
And thinkin' a bad ass hootchie might give the skins quicker
Wake up you gotta another thing comin' little nigga
We grew up on the same block
Went through the same shit
Now how you gonna have me deal with you
You's a trick we both saw your momma get beat down
BY YOUR POPS and saw your auntie get freaked down 
BY YOUR POPS and watched your ass get tore down
Just like your pops and you gets no props
Now you're trying to educate your mind 5 percent inclined
And you never touched the swine 
But what about the old fade that you sportin'
You've staring me down but I'm that hootchie you was shortin'

Hook

Verse 3:
So set to the left of mine
Pack it out when I'm ringin' your chime
A chocolate brother on my arm and he's fine
(He's mine) yeah (yeah) and I'm
Groovin' cause I know he's right here
And ain't nobody jump in the groove I pumps fear
And through he lookin' at my man
Heffer I'm peepin' you a hootchie or not my size eight be deep
In you forget the peace treaty
When you're steppin' to a sweety
Suckas you can't understand I got back if he needs me
Just like Bonnie &amp; Clyde or that gangsta and that hootchie
Yeah I gotta have me a brother strong enough to groove me

Groove with me
So come on and groove me
Even though I'm a hoo hoo hootchie
