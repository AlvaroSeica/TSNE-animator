Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Never needed a hand nope, I did it all alone
With no dad to make a man of me, I did it on my own
A victim, a condition now I'm conditioned for the cold
Even though I know what's missing there's no feeling in this home
Escaped it, a whole leap of problems, isolating instead of facing
I always attract the women who think that I need saving
Even though I'm the only person I can put any faith in
Face it, I'm chained in and happily so, what would I have to hold it if I let all the anarchy go?
Can't take the praise, I just climb my patrol, just know I better deal with hatred and handle it so

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
And I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
(Who's gonna) Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

See what I got in this world? That's how come I can't sleep without poppin a pill
Felt it come back up but I'm still down, Just back to convincing myself that I'm ill now
See with me the stress manifest isn't it, still in me is this ray of happiness and its killing me
I cant control it yet I worry about things that are out of my control and I'm folded
I ain't never letting this introvert out, in a lonely home that could have been but isn't our house
But I ain't in the mood to have any visitors round
So I hide away, my curtains been drawn so long I couldn't tell you if its night or day
So how I feel is the only way that I can hide the pain
People try and help but I shy away but a problem shared is a problem heard
But I care for you too much to make this problem ours
Who knows where this problem starts
Come on Steve and get to mine, you're not scared it's something I'm man enough to be
Or even you get be, how am I meant to handle what I see
When they just found my daddy hanging from a tree

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

Trying to find myself
I don't know where to go from here
Losing my strength
So save me again

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?

So save me again

My back against the wall, there's nowhere else to go
I can't hear you calling, who's gonna catch me when I fall?
Catch me when I fall?
And I'm forever falling
Who's gonna catch me when I fall?</pre>
