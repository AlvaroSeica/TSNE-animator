[Intro]
Player haters
Player haters
We can't the player haters
Yeah man lets kick the funky gangster shit
Give enough respect

[Verse 1]
(Pooh-Man)

Mike a.k.a cash money
Man I tell ya this nigga is funny
Always bragging to the girls about what he had
Sucker always told his dry ass has drama drag
Told the partners he was down with us
We should of figured he was out to get us
He had anthor partner named Jeff
He hooked up with him and game done left
Now we talk bad about me and my crew
High siding with bitchs and talking about fuck Pooh
Now I know just how to handle this
Call up her sister and let her suck my dick
Or maybe I should call his women
And stick my dick in her motherfucking mouth when I'm cumming
See here is some game for you motherfucking fakers
He crossed game so he is a motherfucking player hater

Player haters
Player haters
Player haters

[Verse 2]

I know your asking yourself what is a player hater
Anthor brother who hates me because my game is greater
See I got alot of female friends
I drive a '73 Chevy instead of an '89 Benz
When it comes to women I put my foot down
I give them respect but sometimes I have to clown
And niggas down appected game
So they get behind my back and talk bad about my name
Now I see if you was doing better than me
Now take what he's got and multiply times three
It ain't a bragging thang
I am just a nigga who refuses to cross game
Or let the a bitch be the reason
Man I tell ya it ain't shit but treason
I tell ya man niggas ain't shit
He's just mad because I am fucking his bitch
See I fucked her but never am I paying her
You be a player hater

Player haters
Player haters
They can't stand player haters
Player haters

[Verse 3]

Cash money is a player hater Vince is too
Fuck you niggas and the whole damn crew
You thought you could do me with your punk ass words
But all that bullshit get shot to the curb
Told that bitch about my other bitch
All that player hating did stop shit
Niggas I rob
Ricky and Jay and all you players around the bay
Now lets not forget about Moe and this clip
Ain't shit but a player hating son of a bitch
Now I know we got'em
And will be sitting in the lane
Pussy ass niggas is jelous of the next man
Now I took this time to throw off steam
But I still got his little ass bitch on my team
Now we talk all that shit
It did'nt work faker
But it fucked up trick you ain't shit but a player hater
