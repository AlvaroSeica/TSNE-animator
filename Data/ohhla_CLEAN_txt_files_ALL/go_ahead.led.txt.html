Ey Khaled
Shorty wanna give me the go ahead

See shawty you aint got to tell me what I know

And ya'll get the red light
So if the head right I'll be there err night

Or two, I'm in the dang zip, you wanna come entertain me boo?
We can do that, there, just gimme the go
Been a playa unprepared, everybody grown folks
'Round here, them gold bottles hold them up
Then we can say, cheeers (Let's take a toast)
No wheat or white bread in my Pilsbury dough
Just give me the right head with the letters G-O
All eyes if you like your momma, lame as a video
Imagine you and other kitties(?) strollin all over the city

Go find and it's apparent girl
You feelin luck in the street

[Fat Joe]
Crack! How hot is hot?
She on fire baby burn the block
I even taught her how to turn to pot
You cool it off, and it come back rock (crack!)
Yes! I am him
Pull strings like a violin
Then I cross over like I'm Iverson
To Z100 out to Ireland
White chicks is standin on line
Black chicks is standin on line
Don't discriminate, I disintegrate
So much cake, maybe we can get away

[Lloyd]
I know you see me starin girl

Go find and it's apparent girl
You feelin luck in the street
Girl tell me, what's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead
What's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead</pre>
