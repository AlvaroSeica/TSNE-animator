[Verse 1: Fiend]
They call me Fiend, da adaquate tactics (?)
mask on my face sayin' "bitch, make me use dis Automatic"
mind shot, define stop it I Can't Do It
bet he load them boys hoes so lets get to it
I'm countin my last nickels and quarters
was bothered straight to his daughter, a purple water menauger (?)
conscience never bothered becuz I done had it da hardest
whether da money show, we'll probably kill him regardless
spotted out da targets boy get ready to get him off ya
choke em hit em split him crossin da bridge then we toss em
countin fettuce for lettuce you wishin you never met us
to only come encountered with 17th survivor methods
the crushin of tin (?) address it again stress after da gin
cut up da bodys and leave em in garbage bins
behind da route 2 all lethal
layin down yall people and got away with a g full
