[Sample from "How About Some Hardcore" by M.O.P.]
I roll deep like a motherfuckin Puerto Rican

[Verse One: Joell Ortiz] (Sample from "100%" by Big Pun)
Oh you ain't know, you could leave with half of your face
With one aiyyo (AIYYO!) We play no
Games been that fuego, bang and we lay low
Plane to the island out with Tego (Toma Ma)
Ice grill chillout, melt your whole grill out
Mouthpiece spill out you layin there still out
Wakin up the ambulance paperwork to fill out
We hop up in them new things then peel out (Toma Ma)
Ain't nothin sweet, our bakery is street
Heroes get holes like bagels we roll deep
Oooh! It's straight bread over here
Fireworks e'rywhere you over there huh? (Toma Ma)
Fam, you live once, damn
I'm in here goin been there, that's one, step up from ham
I do it 'cause I can
I got that live music in my pocket, bands (Toma Ma)

[Chorus: Sample from "How About Some Hardcore" by M.O.P.] (Joell Ortiz) 
(*Sample from "100%" by Big Pun)
I roll deep like a motherfuckin Puerto Rican (Like who?)
I roll deep like a motherfuckin Puerto Rican (Like who?)
I roll deep like a motherfuckin Puerto Rican (Like who?
I roll deep like a motherfuckin (*Toma Ma)

Awww man y'all let in a, dope boy predator
Still got work with the chirp on a cellular
Still in the hood I'm a barbershop regular
Ask about your boy man etcetera (*Toma Ma)
My broads is the baddest, horses and carriage
I could walk in with somethin gorgeous from Paris
Back side yaowa awesome fatty
Backshots later on I smack it (**Toma)

[Verse Three Joell Ortiz] (*Sample from "100%" by Big Pun)
A night with the papi, Sprite with Bacardi
Fifth in a Wrangler, knife in a party
Goons e'rywhere, bitches e'rywhere
You damn right we e'rywhere nigga! (*Toma Ma)
You slumped in the bar, my team on the cut
Green in my jeans, green in the dutch
She want a apple mar, green in her cup
She'll be back tomorrow, yep! (*Toma Ma)
Ain't really you can do (Do) 
Your boy is on fire, I'm turnin up the oven in a few
Look at you disgusted with the flu
Sick of me, rubbin on your stomach like you due (*Toma Ma)
Milk crate posse, slam down copy
Iceys for papi, drip down sloppy
Babe boy watch me I'm P.R.'s Rocky
Hook on anybody tryin to stop me 

[Chorus: Sample from "How About Some Hardcore" by M.O.P.] (Sample from "100%" by Big Pun)
I roll deep like a motherfuckin Puerto Rican
