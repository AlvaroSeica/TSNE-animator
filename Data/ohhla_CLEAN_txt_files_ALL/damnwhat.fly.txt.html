[First Verse]
Don't wanna hear another word
One more might just get you served
Expletory remarks that you make to shoot me to the curb
Keep in stride with self-esteem
If you down me I will beam
Right up in the day and moonlight this here Earth has never seen
Is your initiative generated by your jealousy?
Is it infidelity or you just plain dislikin' me?
I won't let that hold me back, your talk is weak as paper sacks
In fact that motivation is for reachin' straight for Haitians jack
Bustas always instigate, even some will speculate
Not to irritate this Playa Flizy when I meditate
Always rain on my parade and rate me as an underdog
Still I will be standin' killin' hard
In the smoke and fog
Conversation killers, talkin' thrillers, often say alot
Then they throwin' salt on me and even hopin' that we rot
Salt is known to melt and so it's not a fear of Parkway
Damn what another say, Flizy gone make it the hard way, hard way

Chorus:

Damn what another say, we gone make it anyway

(8x)

[Second Verse]
Also when you down a Playa
Nothin' but a gossip-maker
You don't wanna see me at the top that's with the Undertaker
Breaker of my concentration, headed for disintegration
Fly must pay my dues and plus pursue a greater occupation
Livin' in prosperity, prosperous as I can be
I will never let another keep me from the T-O-P
Bustas can be full of envy, and your game is clear as glass
Went from one to ten and now I cannot let nothin' past
Keep my eyes open wide, watchin' you and other guys
What you say is cheap and dirty, cannot hurt this Playa Fly
Dirty workin' featherweight, infiltrate and interfere
But no interceptions will be made while I am standing here
If you want to enter this
Then I know you interested
Sooner later, Fly gone pick on tricks, you should have never tested
Native of the S-P-V
Buck the way that we gone stay
Comin' from South Parkway
Damn what another say!  Nigga!!!!!!

Chorus (8x)

[Third Verse]
Also with the enemies
Judgin' up but never gleam
Sayin' what they think you want to hear to keep me off the scene
I don't want revenge, just submission of you wanna bes
Flizy can endure what you can dish and rise to victory
Never trustin' in the truth
Not in what you say or do
Not in tribulations and the trials, that you put me through
Fly got faith that Fly gone make it
It's so real and others fake it
Just awakin' shakin' once again, while you breakin' achin'
Start me from the camel's back
Dig it?  Now I'm strikin' back
Playa's gone attack just like before when bound with glocks and macks
Ridin' off and hittin' paydirt while you tricks are livin' underground
C-O-N-I-N-K-I-N-G, Fly be in Funkytown
Disregarding your remarks
Dodgin' cars, I'm quick to pull
Boy I know that ??? that you flow trick is full of bull
This will be my testament
I will practice what I say
Damn What Another Say, Flizy gone make it anyway, anyway, anyway
