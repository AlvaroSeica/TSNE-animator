Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch or do it on the stairs
Pull your hair out and you'll only get it twisted
Figured us maybe nice, nigga that's how we was livin

[Chorus]
I'll not get old
If I did with my knees, if I grind on my teeth
I know
From the addict of me
From the bottoms of freaks and the way would it seems

[Verse 1]
I'm afraid that's in our fingers, couple gentile in the wrist
'Cause I feel I push that nice in-between her legs and twist
While she listen to that Ottie so I was smoking bong
On the phone, diazepam so that home girl Cory
Girlfriend worried cause her son's in a hurry
To see the state pen or a cemetery buried
Aren't we do our best? Better stay up
Nigga can't talk the street and I'm ready for them drugs
Going HAM when the house ain't takin on dangle
Daddy in and out and who turn that channel?
Niggas tryna oust you steppin on the back
Has another cigarette and a brown paper bag
Smokin joints, glad we're tryna get up on the street
Fuck them, put your terminal crash all day
I called a show for the booze and the bone
Said and done so many nights it was had to keep it goin

[x2]
Now I'm trapped in a trap and the government forgettin
Wanna see me dead or life in a prison
In the system with that vision, only thing I add up
Fuck a fuck nigga tryna get a couple bucks

[Chorus: x2]
25 bucks so I'm a raise ya'll here
Set on the bullshit, do it on the stairs
Put your hair out and you'll only get it twisted
Figured us maybe nice, nigga that's how we was livin

[Chorus]
I'll not get old
If I did with my knees, if I grind on my teeth
I know
From the addict of me
From the bottoms of freaks and the way would it seems

[Verse 2]
Irises, zig zag's good, man fastfood
If we're really ballin, mami call it chinese food
If you're really wonderin why these people got issues
'Cause the wet old and I'm fuckin like glue
On her knees at night, pray a miracle could do
Daddy shootin craps tryna win a pair of shoes
I've been growin my hair, bout to let mami twist it
I'm whilin with my friends, even got myself a biscuit
Only money you can win, nothing to lose
Now we stashin cracks in some hundred dollar shoes
Sittin at his crib, smoking swishers, getting faded
Told me hit my mami up cause we tryna get with it
What we gon do? See that levels dope mane
See if he got bricks, our money in our hand
Same boy jump, nigga same boy front
Me and Kev I'm tyin shit, I gotta be dropped off and homefree
And I don't mean to try, made that girl away forgettin
Wanna see a nigga then I'm locked in a prison
In the system in the vision, only thing add up
Fuck all niggas tryna get a couple bucks
Now I'm trapped in a trap and the government forgettin
Wanna see a nigga dead or life in a prison
In the system with that vision, only thing I add up
Fucked up cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks

[Chorus: x2]
25 bucks so I'm a raise ya'll here
Set on the bullshit, do it on the stairs
Put your hair out and you'll only get it twisted
Figured us maybe nice, nigga that's how we was livin</pre>
