I know this girl whose name is Lola
She lives in a country called Angola
Her president's name is Dos Santos
And a man named Savimbi's playin him too close
She says, "Hey brother, my country's in a war, we are 
Fighting rebels backed by Pretoria"
Upon hearin this I was pretty upset
You know what? I went and told the Stet 
And the Stet said
Yo, is Lola's last name Falana?
(No) Well, my cousin lives in Botswana
(Are they in war too?) Is a heel on a shoe?
My man, they know apartheid like I know you
The president is Masire, capital Gaborone
Where the fight for freedom is a (universal tone)
So are you with it? (I'm in beyond a shadow of doubt)
So let's spell it on, spell it on, spell it on out

A-f-r-i-c-a

Angola
Soweto
Zimbabwe
Tanzania
Zambia

And Botswana
So let us speak about the motherland

Speak about the motherland (about the motherland)
Speak about the motherland (about the motherland)

(South Africa no free, neither will we)

(Free free free)
Free! Free! Free South Africa!
(Free free free)
Free! Free! Free South Africa!
(Free free free...)
Free! Free! Free South Africa!
(...Nelson Mandela)			(2x)

I've seen a TV report and I watched the whole week
That-that-that Samora Machel of Mozambique
Was killed in a crash that couldn't be explained
Yo Dee, I wanna break - yo brother, refrain
Kenneth Kaunda's in Zambia (I'm in America)
SWAPO's in Namibia (Nyerere's in Tanzania)
Mugabe's in Harare, Jesse just came back
&gt;From the homeland, the green and the black
So let's spell it out

A-f-r-i-c-a

Angola

And Botswana
So let us speak about the motherland

Speak about the motherland (about the motherland)
Speak about the motherland (about the motherland)

(South Africa no free, neither will we)

[ The extended version of A.F.R.I.C.A. continues as follows:

Aparheid, it's nothin less than conspicious
Anti-black and pro-ridiculous
Feel it in ya heart, cause it's so for real
But in the mind it develops and becomes the deal
As the struggle survives South Africans rely
On us and u-n-i-t-y
Thinkin back as a slave bonded on those chains
The thoughts of bein free was never the same
Some committed suicide, cause times was harsh
And the ones who survived, they got brainwashed
&gt;From lightin and thunder hails the storm
We can never forget, cause the struggle lives on
Release the chains, or history will burst
Mandela, Mugabe, he's first freedom's power
This here is Africa's hour, the unforgotten people in our

A-f-r-i-c-a

Angola
Soweto
Zimbabwe
Tanzania
Zambia
Mozambique
And Botswana
So let us speak about the motherland

Those are our brothers and sisters across the sea
I'm speakin for the Stet, and we make a plea
To fight apartheid, everybody
To fight against the wicked and help Mugabe
To fight apartheid and assist Nyerere
Support the MK and the ANC
We wanna see Nelson and Winnie free
You don't know - you need to study
And when you do, we're sure you'll agree
They need help, but so do we
Them with their government, us with mentality]
