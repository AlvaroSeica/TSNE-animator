Typed by: Nature2QBC@aol.com

"We're just some men that's on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic RIGHT!" [Slick Rick] 
*sample cut and scratched*

[Cuban Link]
Yo twin, I do my thing, baby Cuban Link is one in a million
Me and my squad of villains be stealin and robbin/Robin like Williams
Then we hop in the BM convertible, I'll verbally murder you
Wit a versatile verse or two, up close and personal, word
I'm Universal like the Studios, put my foot up your booty-hole duke
Then burn that ass like ?Manculio Jew?
Pass the uzi, pun the left hand side and let the best man try
To come test Spanish Fly

[Ju Ju]
Um shorty, how you make it slip like that?
Yo I love it when you wrap your legs around my back
I remember when you used to act shitty and pass
On the video, now you wan' give me that ass
It's all love though, money make the world rotate
I'll be hittin them hips till they dislocate
Yo I'm official wit the pipe game, I ain't no clown
Big Ju mami, gon' make your love come down

[A.L.]
Aiyyo Ju, I speak original, to me there's no comparison
Cuz when it comes to microphones, I'm nicer than Samaritans
I cause embarrassment to rappers, think you servin me?
Y'all could bring the gasoline, but ain't a brotha ever burnin me
My youths concernin me, eternally of the infirmiry
Stalkin these clowns, walkin around, times similar to Germany
Chokin the ground as the skies turn to burgundy
The illest lyricist, that's why these rappers wanna murder me, what!

Chorus 2x

Chorus [Cuban Link]
La di Da di, we love to party
We always cause trouble when we guzzle Bacardi
"We're just some men that's on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic RIGHT!" [Slick Rick]

[Al Tariq]
Aiyyo remember how I used to break them down
I got tears for years when I used to shake them down
And then I dust em off, no come, I calm none done finito
Hit the bad freaks but, be that man burnin the chico
You see yo, mouth pieces, bitch pieces
Four releases, five times in human pieces
Shit ceases, no beef wit the great one
The black sheep could snuff asleep, could bust a fake one

[Problemz]
Get your snot-box Rocked like Charles Dutton
Who else could it be, but no other than the P part three
Still out for cash and killa noise nigga
Spark lah, stay high bring your boys nigga
Head in the sky where it's supposed to be
Writers approachin me, tryin to get close to me
Thinkin about roastin me, psssst...you gotta be jokin me
I'm ultimately one of the top MC's, drop MC's
Lock it down like Monopoly, ain't a damn thing stoppin me

[Black Attack]
Yo yo, now you just done heard five raw MC's
Last but not least Black, bout to blaze these trees
Shit be real walkin in the streets in NYC
I just, hold my head, that thug shit ain't me
Son you know how it be, offically feelin mad vibe inside of me
Catch me on a island, still screamin "Fuck that!"
Drop a charter, we on tracks
Yo Black rep that, everytime I'm on wax 

Chorus 2x

[Cuban Link]
Yo yo, yo yo La di Da di, we love to party
"Just some men, we're just some men that's on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic RIGHT!"
(You don't stop)
Yo yo, La di Da di, we love to party
"Just some men, we're just some men that's on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic RIGHT!"</pre>
