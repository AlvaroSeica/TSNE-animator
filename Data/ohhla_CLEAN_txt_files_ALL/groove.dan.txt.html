[Chorus 2X]
That's how we groove baby
That's how we groove
When we groove
When we groove baby
That's how we groove baby
Now all my ladies sing

[Verse 1]
Check it out
You ain't gon' find no better
Rhino-sweater wearin'
Swearin', heavy cursin'
Nestle-slurpin' nerd on TV
Surely you heard of me
The booth-attacker, wack producer/rapper
Slash attempted hacker
Back up in this bitch again
Now that that's out the way, let's get this party started
Let's pour some liquor out for the dearly departed
You now rockin' with the hardest-workin' artist ever
How you gonna g-g-g-get down, wearin' a cardigan sweater?
You better let down your hair, chunk a deuce up in the air
And say "yeah", this is my jam
Gotdamn, three cheers for Dan, and
We can get it poppin', rock-and-rollin', Janis Joplin-in'
Ain't stoppin' 'til the break of dawn...gone 

[Bridge]
Thank you for that guitar solo, me (you're welcome)
Now, I don't know about you, but umm
It's the weekend
I just got paid
I don't care who looks at me crazy
I came here to enjoy myself

[Verse 2]
Check it
I'm on my new shit
You know I'm on my "Cafe Surreal, Pt. 2" shit
And there really isn't anything that you can do, shit
Virtual insanity
Infectious tunes, mixed up with a dash of profanity, fuck it
It's Friday night and I am feelin' life
And I am feelin' like, you could be the one
What's your name, hon'?
If you gon' dance with me, you can't be coy
Loosen up so I can show you how I crank that Danny boy
Now watch me YOOOOOUUUUU

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
