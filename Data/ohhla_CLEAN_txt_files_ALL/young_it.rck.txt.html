Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
Young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches
Cause I'm young and I'm getting it, I'm young and I'm getting it

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
Said Shawty wanna rolling, I'm like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I'm just living my life
I'm just young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
Young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches
Cause I'm young and I'm getting it, I'm young and I'm getting it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, young nigga I get money and fuck hoes on my spare time
She don't fuck on the first night, then she don't mean my damn life
Niggaz smoking that Bob Marley, that Bob Marley like yeah molly
I'm sipping on the whole A for that purp shit, bed time
I cop forz like jaws, y'all niggaz ain't import'
Shawty want that molly, and I'm a get what she order
Tats all in my body, strapped up like a war
Eat the pussy I prolly, if it smell like water
Her neck talk say fuck me, my wrist talk say suck me
The niggaz claiming they balling, I take yoru bitch Chris Humphrey
And make them buy me a whip nigga
Nothing less than the 6 nigga,
Y'all ray I'm up like hoes, all you are some bitch niggaz

[Chorus]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
And Shawty wanna rolling, I'm like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I'm just living my life
I'm just young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
Young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches
Cause I'm young and I'm getting it, I'm young and I'm getting it

[Verse 2: Meek Milll]
Okay, your baby mama, I ball that, side chick I ball that
Main chick, I ball that, and your dream girl just called back
I'm still repping that north side with that big P on my ballcap
These broke niggaz don't like me, cause they say I think I'm all that
Now come cop that 'rarri, I don't need to feel sorry
Niggaz claiming my flows, I took pretty niggaz on mar
And I ain't claming these hoes, have these haters looking all sorry
When I pulled up in that Roll's, swag was surfing on 'em like narley
Like 3 hoes like Santa Clause, saying I'm the boss, ya'll interupt
Hit you girl by mistake nigga, wasn't even in my plan at all
I told homie I hit it there, these niggaz wanna be planned all
Knowing that girl is main thang, that shit don't like nigga, bang, bang

[Chorus]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
And Shawty wanna rolling, I'm like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I'm just living my life
I'm just young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
Young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches
Cause I'm young and I'm getting it, I'm young and I'm getting it

Young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches
Cause I'm young and I'm getting it, I'm young and I'm getting it</pre>
