[Verse 1: Jesse Abraham]
I'm just a boat
Floatin' on the sea
The waves wave at me
I wait patiently
For wind to push my sail even though it's always happening
No man's an island but everyone's a captain
This water's infinite but once I'm divin into it
I intuitively become too intimate
Artillery is artistry; it's all ammo here
I'm swimming in my arteries
My hands hold fear
So I'm sinking in this part of me
Thinking that it's hard to be on varsity
Listening with Van Gogh's ear
Should I pull the plug and let the water down the drain?
Empty out this ocean of devotion, emotion and pain
My mouth is watering
But blood is thicker than the picture that you picture when you drown
your tears in liquor
I'm a swimmer in tsunamis
A swami in this slaughter
The story that I tell is of hell and high water, it's

[Verse 2: Jesse Abraham]
did you know that I grew up to believe that writin a novel isn't novel?
I'm full of awe but never awful
Rofl
All full of water is my ship
I fall off of the lip of the cliff taking notes as I drift
Lift and raise my sail to no avail
So available I write with no veil
So frail is my flow
I stay warm though
Mighty oaks from little acorns grow
Might the yoke from in a egg turn slow
To a nectar
And then petrol
Patrol the tides and control the mast
Cajole the masses amassed outside
I'm a ship in this mist even if I'm dismissed by business or listlessness
I exist
Amidst the richness of quickness and imprints of figment princes
I swim in pigment
It's just

[Verse 3: Homeboy Sandman]
A good sun can eclipse an entire stark moon
A single candle can light an entire dark room
Spades with hearts aren't on only entire card suits
A single heart thumpin could trump an entire cartoon
Nuts and pretzels aren't the only bar foods
Mars and Snickers aren't the only bar foods
Froze fruit isn't the only borrowed fruit
My bars're food
When a pawn is appointed as a ploy 	
All those anointed will point out he has no flows
Cats'll point out the emperor has no clothes
Miss and misses will exist if the hacks can't coax
Authentics will exist if the hacks can't clone
Basic truths will exist if the crap can't cloak
Open minds will exist if the crack can't close
Always and forever
