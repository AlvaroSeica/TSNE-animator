YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW

I never thought that it could come down to this
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
it's a subject that I just can't resist
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
You got jokes, but this one here is for you
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
here's a list of things I think you should do
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
As yellow as some pineapple punch
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
they got that way because you don't brush
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
It's too late for that, toothpaste won't be enough
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
you probably got gingivitis in your gums
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
How you smell so freely showin' ya teef
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
if I was you, i'd go and get them shits bleached
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
You need to start buyin toothbrushes by tha threes
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
did anybody ever tell ya they look like straight cheese
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
Mustard yellow, soon they'll be green and brown
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
you totally disgust tha people your around
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
I must admit, they nasty as fuck
YA TEEF IZ YELLOW
God forbid somebody drink out your cup</pre>
