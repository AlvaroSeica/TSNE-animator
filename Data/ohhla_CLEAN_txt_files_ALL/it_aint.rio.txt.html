(Laugh) It Ain't easy being Rio.....

It ain't easy being that nigga Rio
Cause that nigga Rio always need another G-yo
niggaz know my stilo the reals of life
so before I give this up you'll have to kill me twice
I'm rolling through my neighborhood feeling fresh and clean
God bless the fiends for my success and dreams
Cause when you living in the funk it's no hopes or dreams
You can either slam dunk or sell dope to fiends
I first scoped the scene when I was fourteen
dropped out of high school cause I needed more cream
It was a war scene living on the south side of chi town
Cause everybody was getting shot or getting locked down
And I was hanging with these niggaz for fame
cause though I needed change I was breeded to bang
Hang as I slanged getting cheese for drugs
You just gotta know it ain't easy being a thug-

It ain't easy growing up to be
That nigga Rio when you living in the C
Hey It ain't ain't easy growing up to be
When everyone you see is going six feet deep
Hey It ain't easy can't a nigga tell
So many black men is either dead or in jail
Can you tell it ain't easy
Can you tell it ain't easy to be the Reeee'

It was hard getting a job
Getting interviewed by uncle tom man Bob
And you know he just throb to turn me down
send a brother right back to the streets
So now I gotta rob and I'm packing my heat
Cause in these streets you never know when you'll
Be taking your last they see I'm making my cash
I got my tape in the dash..............
But gotta clear view I can see both niggaz running
Up through my rearview their getting near to
So I take out my piece cause I'm gonna be a thug at least
More slugs in the streets, going to court
Shit judge gotta grudge now I'm coming up short
they send me to a fort
now I'm sitting in a cell thinking about
the times when I had alittle mail
couldn't prevail cause the same color brother
couldn't make a sale with me
it's be my own brothers out to get me
It ain't easy !!

It ain't easy growing up to be
That nigga Rio when you living in the C
Hey It ain't ain't easy growing up to be
When everyone you see is going six feet deep
Hey It ain't easy can't a nigga tell
So many black men is either dead or in jail
Can you tell it ain't easy
Can you tell it ain't easy to be the Reeee'

That's why you gotta ball every chance you get
and when you think you got it all you must advance yo shit
cause shit niggaz get jealous
your thinking their your fellas
they plotting on your ass with the wooden sweat-us
They wouldn't let us come together
Like back in the days before the crack and the crave
And all the gats that den sprayed
Is it late now I gotta a whole black race
running streets with the hate now is this the fate now
even with a sound we don't listen to this
the only time they come around is when I glisten my wrist
I'm on a mission to list every friend that I had
that was all on my shit back when I was doing bad
that's sad but I gotta stay motivated
They steady wanna please me now that I made it
Shit It ain't easy just look at my skin
Being that nigga Rio without family or friends
It ain't easy-

[2X]
It ain't easy growing up to be
That nigga Rio when you living in the C
Hey It ain't ain't easy growing up to be
When everyone you see is going six feet deep
Hey It ain't easy can't a nigga tell
So many black men is either dead or in jail
Can you tell it ain't easy
Can you tell it ain't easy to be Rio</pre>
