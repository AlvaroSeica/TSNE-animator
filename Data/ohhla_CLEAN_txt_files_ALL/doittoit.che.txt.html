[Cherish]
Step out the caddy, ya feel
It's on bust a steel, them boys checkin' us out
Know when we dress to kill
Strut up in the club
It's dark but still got my shades on
I hear the DJ mixin' Young Buck to the whisper song
We from the city that make it OK (A A A A)
To turn the clubin' into a holiday
So if ya' feelin' right, grab the kryptonite
This ya' song tonite, and it's on tonight

[Chorus]
Bounce wit it, drop wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it, snap wit It
All my ladies pop ya' backs wit it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
You know the world be rockin to it, to it
So do it, do it, do it, to it
Bounce wit it, drop wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it, snap wit it
All my fellas tip ya' hats wit it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
You know the world be rockin to it, to it
So do it, do it, do it, to it

[Cherish]
No need to ask where I'm from, you already know
I represent the "A" from my head to my toes
Step on the dance flo' watch and learn, 'cuz here I go
I throw my hands up and work my body to the flooo'
We from the city that make it OK (A A A A)
To turn the clubbin' into a holiday
So if ya feelin right, grab the kryptonite
This ya song tonite, and it's on tonight

[Chorus]
Bounce wit it, drop wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it, snap wit it
All my ladies pop ya' backs wit it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
You know the world be rockin' to it, to it
So do it, do it, do it, to it
Bounce wit it, drop wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it, snap wit it
All my fellas tip ya' hats wit it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
You know the world be rockin' to it, to it
So do it, do it, do it, to it (A A A A)

[Sean Paul]
What's up 'cuz, 'cuz (what's up 'cuz, 'cuz)
What's up folk, folk (what's up folk, folk)
I lean I rock (I lean I rock)
I drink I smoke (I drink I smoke)
Might snap my fangas (might snap my fangas)
Might clap my hands (might clap my hands)
Don't get it twisted pimpin' this a hood dance (hood dance)
Throw up ya' hood man (man)
Roll up some wood man (man)
They hang 'cuz they can't do it, do it, do it
(Cherish: do it, do it, do it) man (man)
I'm ridin' good man (man)
We grip the wood it man (man)
I'm in the club ten grand in the rubber band (band)
Damn right I'm crunk (I'm crunk)
Damn right I'm clean (I'm clean)
They got that rock (that rock)
They got that lean (that lean)
We make a pool palace (palace)
I make ya shoulder lean (shoulder lean)
And I'ma show it (show it) nahmean!?

[Chorus] - 2X
