[Intro: Ron Browz]
Yeah! (Real nigga shit!) Huh!
(You got a problem nigga?) Yeah! (Get at me nigga!) What!
Bitch nigga get at me! Yeah! Bitch nigga get at me! Yeah!
Bitch nigga get at me! Yeah! Bitch nigga get at me! Huh!

[Chorus: Ron Browz] (Papoose)
I'm reppin my gang, Yeah! (I'm flaggin) I'm reppin my gang, Yeah! (I'm flaggin) 
I'm reppin my gang, Yeah! (Wave yo' flag!) I'm reppin my gang, Yeah! (Wave yo' flag!) 
Bitch nigga get at me!

[Verse One: Papoose]
I carry that thing in my Gucci belt (Gucci belt)
I look at the world through my Gucci glasses (Glasses)
I carry a bird in my Louis bag (Louis bag)
You get me forty two stacks you could have it 
I got the bakin soda in my 'frigerator ('Frigerator)
I got the Zip lock bags in my cabinet
I'm ridin with Thuga in that new whip (New whip)
We see our enemies then we stop in traffic, bitch nigga get at me!
Mama ain't raised no savage
But if you want me you better pay yo' balance
Them Brooklyn niggas they so violent, you a deadbeat shooter
Ain't man enough to raise yo' ratchet
Screamin you the best, but you ain't no Khaled
I gotta bird in my car and it ain't no parrot
Big homie?! That ain't yo' status
I got them clips on my hip, and they ain't No Malice

[Chorus: Ron Browz] (Papoose)
Bitch nigga get at me! Yeah! Bitch nigga get at me! Yeah!
Bitch nigga get at me! Yeah! Bitch nigga get at me! Huh!
I'm reppin my gang, Yeah! (I'm flaggin) I'm reppin my gang, Yeah! (I'm flaggin) 
I'm reppin my gang, Yeah! (Wave yo' flag!) I'm reppin my gang, Yeah! (Wave yo' flag!) 
Bitch nigga get at me!

[Verse Two: Papoose]
I be in the clubs throwin bottles up (Bottles up)
We gettin money I be where them stacks be (Stacks be)
Bitch boys say they waan do sum'n (Do sum'n)
But they never ever get at me (At me)
If I ain't in head up, I'm on Lafayette (Between Louis and Stuyvesant!)
It ain't hard to find Mr. Mackie (Mackie)
Bitch boys say they waan do sum'n (Do sum'n)
But they never ever get at me, bitch nigga get at me!
Pop hammers fly clothes watch wearer
iphone 5 cameras, my flows got clearer
Grind healer dime scrambler, I am a wise planner
None of y'all drop grammer like the man in my mirror
Yacht sailor shot blammer cop scarer
Turn this track to a dead beat, like a man who can't buy pampers
Curse like a song bitch, motherfucker god dammer
Man I run this shit like, Mylanta tell 'em get at me!

[Chorus: Ron Browz]
Bitch nigga get at me! Yeah! Bitch nigga get at me! Yeah!
Bitch nigga get at me! Yeah! Bitch nigga get at me! Huh!
I'm reppin my gang, yeah! I'm reppin my gang, yeah!  
I'm reppin my gang, yeah! I'm reppin my gang, yeah! 
Bitch nigga get at me!
