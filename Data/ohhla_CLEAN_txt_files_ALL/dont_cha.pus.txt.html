Let me talk to y'all &amp; jus u know give ya a lil situation..listen {fellas}

[Rap Verse 1] Busta Rhymes {Pussycat Dolls}
Ya see this shit get hot
Everytime I come through When I step up in the spot {R U ready}
Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
Prowl for the best chick
Yes I'm on the lookout {Let's Dance}
Slow bangin shorty like a belly dancer wit it
Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta wit it {ooo baby, yeahh}
No tricks Only diamonds under my sleeve
Gimme tha number
but make sure ya call before ya leave

[Verse 1]
I know you like me (I know you like me)
I know you do (I know you do)
That's why whenever I come around, she's all over you
And I know you want it (I know you want it)
It's easy to see (It's easy to see)
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be fuckin' with me

[Chorus]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me
Don't cha, don't cha
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me
Don't cha, don't cha

[Verse 2]
Fight the feeling (fight the feeling)
Leave it alone (leave it alone)
Cause if it ain't love
It just ain't enough to leave a happy home (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Let's keep it friendly (let's keep it friendly)
You have to play fair (you have to play fair, yeahh)
See, I don't care
But I know, she ain't gon' wanna share

[Chorus] {Busta Rhymes}
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me (like me)
Don't cha, don't cha, baby
Don't cha, alright, sing
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me (raw)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me (big thrills)
Don't cha, {OK I see how it's goin down} ahhh, don't cha
{Seems like shorty wanna little menage pop off or sumthin, let's go}

[Rap Verse 2] Busta Rhymes
Well let me get straight to it
E'ery broad wan watch a nigga when I come through it
It's the god almighty, lookin all brand new
If shorty wanna jump in my ass then vanjewish (VANQUISH)
Lookin at me all like she really won do it
Tryna put it on me till my balls black an blueish
Ya wanna play wit ah playa girl then play on
Strip out the chanel
And leave the lingerie on
Watch me and I'ma watch you at the same time
Lookin at ya wan break my back
You the very reason why I keep a pack ah the Magnum
An wit the wagon hit chu in the back of tha magnum
For the record Don't think it was sumthin you did
Shorty all on me cuz it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get ? so I could hit the both of y'all

[Chorus]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me (like me)
Don't cha, don't cha, baby
Don't cha, alright, sing
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me (raw)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me (big thrills)
Don't cha</pre>
