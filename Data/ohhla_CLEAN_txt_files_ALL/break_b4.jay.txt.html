[ VERSE 1: Kool Rock Jay ]
Kool's back in your mind, so wake up
No chance for you to even make up
An excuse for the Rock not to get loose
We can't come to no terms and no truce
All around lyrics and some say adaptable
I never stop cause I'm compatible
With any beat, pace or metronome
Rhymes are deadly - leave it alone
Here's a challenge you can live up to
The MC that uses mic voodoo
I got a spell for all of you
Turn the mic into clay and make dolls of you
Too late before you realize
One by one you drop like flies
Dead as a door knob, done and over
Kool Rock Jay is back, now you know

Break 'fore you're broke on
You better break

(J-a-y)  --&gt; Run-D.M.C.

[ VERSE 2: Kool Rock Jay ]
The way they disappear is like magic
To bite the Rock would be tragic
You can't understand, I ain't your fan
But I serve you suckers as fast as I can
Nullify narrators of all kind
Set a mic ablaze when I rhyme
You shoulda broke when I told you to break
Now you're another sucker to annihilate
Pay attention as I mention my last warning
Comin to you swift like a storm'n
You're absent minded, spell binded
Lookin for a way back home but can't find it
Absolutely, nevertheless, said and done
You wouldn't be cryin if you won
Vindicator, devastator, mutilator
The one you and your crew just hate'a

[ VERSE 3: Kool Rock Jay ]
Inflictin wounds, puttin punks in tombs
You're sittin there calm - now you're doomed
Takin out suckers like a gunslinger
The name Kool Rock's a bell ringer
You shoulda listened to what you're missin
Now you're another sucker that I'm dissin
Destroyin MC's of all shapes and sizes
Rhymes that devastate you, no compromises
You're nothin, another word for zero
Don't try to get ill, boy, and be no hero
Dig a hole and give yourself relief
Right in the dirt, rest in peace
Cause now you know the rapper, rhymer, capper
Takin out you sucker motherfuckers cause I have to
It's a story told by me
Occupation: a dope MC

Break 'fore you're broke on
(Better be cool)
(Cool)
You better break
(Rock)
Break 'fore you're broke on
(Slice is on the fader)

[ VERSE 4: Kool Rock Jay ]
Take a ( ? ) get your pad and pen
Cause what I'ma say I ain't gon' say it again
Suckers hang around like parasites
That's waitin to bite while I'm on the mic
But I don't care cause I got many
When I say many then I mean plenty
Of rhymes and rhymes and a lot more rhymes
You ain't even halfway, you got a lot to climb
So hang on, grab the rope and keep pullin
You keep eatin and eatin until you're full'n
After that, jack, you'll be stuck
Sayin to yourself that you had enough
Of the rap desaster, rhymer and roller
Sippin and trippin on a glass of Coca-Cola
In motion with waves in the ocean
Servin all suckers with a lot of devotion

(Check out the master as the cuts these jams)
Break 'fore you're broke on
(Cuttin and scratchin are the aspects of his game)  --&gt; Run-D.M.C.
You better break
(Check out the master as the cuts these jams)
Break 'fore you're broke on
(Cuttin and scratchin)
Kick it

[ VERSE 5: Kool Rock Jay ]
Astronomical, geometric
Ocean and ( ? ) places I infected
This is a jam with a hip-hop beat
Completin your need that I rock street
Bass kickin loud and Jay draw a crowd
Rock a fresh style is what I'm about
I'm a MC and I'm full of ambition
To serve a sucker's the key of my ignition
Show me your styles and I match 'em
Beats and rhymes fuse together like atoms
I drop to stop all altercations
To the same old killer and no alterations
Battlin time and you show up
Jay's a landmine, and you blow up
The mic is mine, man, cause I'm possessive
Attackin you first cause I'm aggressive

Break 'fore you're broke on
You better break</pre>
