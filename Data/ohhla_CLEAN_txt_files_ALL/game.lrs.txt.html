K.FLAY:
Boys, boys all types of boys
Black, White, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys
I whisper in my sexy voice
Old-fashioned seduction's what I employs
Because a girl that's as fine as me should be living it up as far as I can see
So although I can be a mild-mannered kind of chick
Walk in a room of guys and I take my pick
Like you with the real cute face,
Wanna get to know you better, maybe round third base
Touch him on his shoulder, laughing at his jokes
Get his mind spinning like some bike spokes
Now I'm all he can imagine wishes he could make it happen
From the jeans that he wears I can tell that he's packing
At the end of the day trying to get some jollies
Know you're liking what you see baby so call me

CHORUS:
All these folks wanna hug and kiss
Seeing our style and they can't resist
We attract hotties
Perfect 10s with the banging bodies
All these folks wanna hook it up
Post-show yeah you know that we shook it up
Yeah we're in the zone
And we never go home alone, play on

MC LARS:
Just played a big show all these girls trying to holler
They see MC Lars and they know he's a baller
But I've got discerning taste
Not about to hook it up with a butterface
18 to 39, man I've rocked them all
London, Brooklyn, Melbourne booty calls
But I always wrap it up on and off the stage
Juno, I even got with Ellen Page
I had a three-way, but it was a conference call
With my manager and agent about the tour next fall
If your girlfriend's a ten better watch your lady
Or I'm a run game like Tracy McGrady
I break hearts at your book club luncheon
No compunction, that's my function
I've made mad women happy, it's honestly insane
So don't hate the player, girl hate the game

CHORUS:
All these folks wanna hug and kiss
Seeing our style and they can't resist
We attract hotties
Perfect 10s with the banging bodies
All these folks wanna hook it up
Post-show yeah you know that we shook it up
Yeah we're in the zone
And we never go home alone, play on

MC LARS:
Three o'clock Flay, homeboy's checking you out
I'm a head over there and see what he's about
He's a startup CEO about to make mad money
Wants to take you to his penthouse, make you his honey

K.FLAY:
Up on the left I see a girl for you
She's got a Minor Threat shirt and a rad tattoo
She wants to bump and grind, call you her mister
Plus she's got a really hot sister

MC LARS:
Yo that dude looks like Cristiano Ronaldo
He's five feet tall though

K.FLAY:
That's too small bro!
Giving you eyes is a babe with a tramp stamp
She can do it upside down in a handstand

MC LARS: On the dance floor mad peeps start mobbin
They're loving us tonight, Flay let's get it popping

K.FLAY:
Lars, you're speaking the truth
Bout to knock it out the park (like who?) Babe Ruth

CHORUS:
All these folks wanna hug and kiss
Seeing our style and they can't resist
We attract hotties
Perfect 10s with the banging bodies
All these folks wanna hook it up
Post-show yeah you know that we shook it up
Yeah we're in the zone
And we never go home alone, play on</pre>
