Alright, not bad, duplicant 9002
Kinda catchy, repeatable
Easily readable, and for you believable
But nobody likes a song about quitters
What are you, a hippy? I told you to rip me
Rip me off a hit song, everybody's gotta sing along
It's gotta be dirty, gotta be illegal
Everybody loves it when it's bad for you like

Sex, drugs and drugs, fuck rock n roll
Sex, drugs and drugs, fuck rock n roll

Ha, look alive duplicant CC2005
You're fucked up all the time tryna talk and rhyme
You can only speak in initials, that's fine for most lines
Considering what you got in your spine like

Sex, drugs and drugs, fuck rock n roll
Sex, drugs and drugs, fuck rock n roll

Drugs, I want drugs, I want drugs, I want drugs
I want drugs, I need drugs, I want drugs, I want drugs
I want drugs, I want drugs, I want drugs, I want drugs
I want drugs, I need drugs, I want drugs

Sex, drugs and drugs, fuck rock n roll
Sex, drugs and drugs, fuck rock n roll

Alright
Alright, fuck rock n roll</pre>
