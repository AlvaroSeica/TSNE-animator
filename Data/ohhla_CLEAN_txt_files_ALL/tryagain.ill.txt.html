[Chorus]
We fly the pen like a pilot when it's time to begin
Fight to win with the power that makes the sky bend
We got to end to make room for the Christ to begin
If it ain't dope enough then, yo, got to try again.

[Verse]
I get you up like Vivarin, an unpredictable trend
Many men remain content with where the needle has been
In an elliptical spin of people dying in sin
We realize to reap our talents lies in trying again
So I don't try to pretend that I'm phatter than him
I just make heads come apart like a detachable limb
And carry on like I'm collapsible overhead in your plane
Holding titles for collateral, leaving cats with no name
Line them up like cocaine and light them like propane
While they're profane, we rock from Florida to Spokane
Washington, I've watched them rock to kicks, snares and rim shots
They think their junk is tight when it's loose like slip knots
Yo, but I can't trip, AK, cuz everybody can change
They could flip their whole persona ala Shirley McClain
But we aim for the heavenlies and try to tame the 7 seas
Because when you claim the Trinity, you'd better shoot for the stars
Battle scars and open wounds from open mics that I've closed
Open minds and open doors for all my brothers in prose
I send cerebral celebrations with my mic and my pen
If you don't get it, kid you guessed it, I'ma try it again

[Chorus]</pre>
