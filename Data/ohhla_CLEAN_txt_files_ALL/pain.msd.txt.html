Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Allowing you to pollute my space with ya bullshit
You been doing me wrong, I been
Unhappy with this relationshit
Putting up with it
For way to long
I been, stooping to your level
Playing games
Going out my way to disrespect you
Though I accept that you cant do me nothing
That I aint let you do... hmmmmmmm

I been repeating myself, its frustrating
All this confrontation is stagnating
And animosities all I'm accumulating
You say you gonna change
Well I'm done waiting baby

[Chorus]
I gotta get away cause I need to heal
Can't take another day of how you make you feel
Gotta get away so I can break the chain
You causing all this pain but imma take the blame
Cause you don't understand what your doing
And it's like there so urgency to change
I remember days that you consoled me
Now I see that only I can lift my pain

You think cause you aint beating me or cheating on me
The way you mistreating me aint abuse
But if you loved me
You wouldn't want me here with you
And you know that its true
You got me standing in the mirror asking a woman
I don't know, why the f**k she stuck around
Cause I been living with a stranger
That gets off on putting and keeping and seeing me down
I aint seen that man I feel in love with in so long
Did he exist, was I fooled?
Cause he was so beautiful and you are so... cruel

[Repeat Chorus]
Ohhh, let it go, let it go, let it gooo hmmmm

I been repeating myself, its frustrating
All this confrontation is stagnating
And animosities all I'm accumulating
You say you gonna change
Well I'm done waiting baby

[Repeat Chorus Twice]</pre>
