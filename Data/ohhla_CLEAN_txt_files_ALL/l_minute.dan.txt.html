[Dan-e-o]
{*gun cocks*} This could be my last minute!
The gun's loaded and cocked, ready to blast and my face is in the path of it
Authoritatively asked to come with
a prayer in my final 60 seconds of life but I can't stomach
the pressure and pain, the stress in my veins
Recallin the number of unforgiven sins I can presently name
If heaven's my aim I best start confessin my shame
to God cause I won't get the chance to impress him again
This could be my last minute!

[Conwell]
This could be my last minute!
Dig it, rhymes are often tainted
An officer, by whom I was confrontated
A conversation in a hood that was often raided
He's contemplating on doing what he's obligated
He planted a, weapon on me make things complicated
Your occupation to twist the shit keep constipated
Incarcerated but I am no, Carson Daly
Protect and serve, and this is how you're operatin?
Altercation, nothin more than accusations
After all the, task force task was wasted
An ex-change of words and then it escalated
Excuse me but you niggaz I have always hated
Mad with power, skin was dark not powdered
Now what a coward, maybe cause he often cowered
Lay you in a bed of flowers
You're +The Spy Who Shagged Me+ but no Austin Powers
Damn, this could be my last minute!

[Dan-e-o]
This could be my last minute! And if my ass finished
I hope He listens before He decide to pass sentence
First I must ask forgiveness from each Canadian artist
who beat me in the battle of who could take it the farthest
Although you ain't the hardest and I be lyrically flawless
Jealousy got the best of me when you became ballers
I should've practiced what I preached 'stead of gnashin all my teeth
Grab the mic and start some action on the street
You bastards can't compete, steady blastin y'all with heat
Just ask and you'll receive a lash from this assassin on the beat
Shit, there I go again, evil is how my rhyme get
Cause I don't have an answer as to why I ain't signed yet
So STOP FUCKIN ASKIN ME, that stupid shit!
In the time you've blown up and fallen off I'll still be doin it
Damn, I guess that wasn't much of a prayer
God I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to take it there
Cause this could be my last minute!

[Conwell]
This could be my last minute!
For every action everybody's accountable
Idiotic niggaz grow up and try to puncture you
When you have nothin, pinpoint what they want from you
Now even assholes try they best to be punctual
Withheld are the Mietas that have it out for you
Concealed is the direction they're gonna come for you
Now which mans hired hit mans 
to stick mans and ditch mans
Cause, this could be my last minute!

[Dan-e-o]
This could be my last minute! So I have to confess
I practically hit every ass that has passed in a dress
At least I wanted to, the devil tends to push me
But how's it possible to not proposition for pussy?
Girlfriend or not even if I said I loved her
I never had the heart to say, "Yeah, I fucked her"
Even as I repent upon further inspection
I never really asked for that erection
Tell me it ain't natural for me to wanna slap a hoe
Excuse me, insert my penis deeply inside of the vaginal
openin, I'm hopin that I won't feel a shock
Cause I admit I love every piece of ass that I got
Oh God, this could be my last minute!

[Conwell]
This could be my last minute!
I'm just a man who says the things that trouble him
And immigrants aren't the only thing that's smuggled in
Yo, move how you're s'posed to move
You lose someone close to you, you do what you're s'posed to do
Why? Cause cops carry toasters too
So boys buy guns so they can speak when they're spoken to
Life's pre-destined, written in the stars
So when God made Adam we got Even with the odds
I'm the son of Adam, boy to Eve
And if the whole world is envy I must be greed
And plus I choose to avoid the thing lust with ease
God I can't believe, that
This could be my last minute!

[Dan-e-o]
This could be my last minute! And I'm hurtin so bad
Forgive me for every dream in which I murdered my dad
But if wantin women and respect is wrong nigga
Just pull the motherfuckin trigger!
WAIT NO~! {*BLAM*}</pre>
