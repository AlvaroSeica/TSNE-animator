Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In my head your smile appears clear
Wish it wasn't my imagination
But in a way was a dream
Your eyes they tell it all, called it
Hope you got a good heart
And you're smart
You got a good head on your shoulders
That's what turns a nigga on, strong
Feelings that I have you'll probably never
Find out ever
I'll admire from afar, star
Keep doing all the great things you're doing
You got it going on, young lady

Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
[x4]

How'd you get so fuckin' cool?
Fools probably trying to spit at you daily
The price you pay cause you're hot
Has anyone told you that you're fresh as hell
And I dig the way you wear your hair too
It makes you look more mature
See I just wanna be a man, and
I think you can be the one to guide me
But who the fuck am I kidding?!
And you know they say I'm wild
But real people rarely come around, if ever
You got it going on young lady

Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
[x4]

You turn a nigga on
These feelings I have you'll find out never
Unless you're clever
I'll admire from afar, star
Keep doing all the good things you're doing
You got it going on, young lady

Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin' on, young lady
