[Intro - Gwen]
C'mon, Johnny! When you're gonna get here?

[Johnny Vulture]
Alright, hold your pretty horses, I'll be there in a minute
You just get yourself dolled up, alright Tootsie?
You pick a place! You just pick a place!

[Gwen] Um, Johnny?
[Vulture] Yeah, Gwennie-Gwen-GWEN?
[Gwen] You might wanna hurry
Because tonight, is theeeeeeeeeeeeeeee niiiiiiiight....

[Gwen Stefani - Verse One]
I'm empty, I need fulfilling
Yes I do love, a-to the ceiling
When I do love, I get this feeling
When I'm in love...
I'm restless
Can't you see I try my bestest
To be [a] good girl, because it's just us
So take me now, and do me justice
I'm waiting, a-patiently
Anticipating, your arrival
and I'm hating, it takes so long
to get to my house, to take me out

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna give you all my looooove in the backseat
Bubble, Pop, Elec-tric; Bubble, Pop, Elec-tric
Gonna speed it down and slow it uuuuuuup in the backseat
Bubble, Pop, Elec-tric; Uh-oh! In the backseat

[Verse Two]
Okay now
I understand he's on his way now
But jeez Louise, I mean today now!
I can't wait, I wanna play, now!
I'm antsy, Bubble Pop Electric pansies
My sweet tooth, I want your candy
The Queen of Eng would say it, randy [*laughs*]
I'm itchy
I wish you would come and scratch me
Tonight I'm falling, won't you catch me?
Swoop on by so you can snatch me
and take me out

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The need to be satisfiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiied
Come pick me up, I want a riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide
Hurry, hurry come to meeeeeeeeeeeee
Drive-innnnnnn movieeeeeeee
Drive innnnnnn move meeeeee
Drive innnnnnto meeeeeeeeeeeeee

[Gwen and Vulture's conversation overlaps bridge]
[*doorbell rings*]
[Gwen] I'll get it!! [*Gwen hurries downstairs to answer door*]
Hey Johnny! Lemme go grab my sweater
[Vulture] Hi, Mrs. Stefani
[Gwen - as she goes outside] BYE MOM!!
[Vulture] So, baby where you wanna go, huh?
[*car revs, then speeds away*]

[Break 2X]
Bubble Pop Electric, you've gotta get it
(Straight to me, drive-in movie)
Take it to the back seat, run it like a track meet
(Come to me, drive-in movie)

[Chorus, then the song adds Break into it]

[Johnny Vulture]
Yeah, tell your father, I said 'ello!

[Gwen Stefani]
Johnny, get outta here!

[*car then speed away as crickets chirp*]</pre>
