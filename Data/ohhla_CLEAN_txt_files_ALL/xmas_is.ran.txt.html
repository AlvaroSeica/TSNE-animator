[Intro/Chorus]
Fix ya face homeboy, it's a time for joy
Eggnog and toys (Christmas is coming)
Yeah! Fireplace is lit, find a place to sit
and get a taste of it (Christmas is coming)
Take a sip of your tea, start trimming the tree
I'm beginning to see (Christmas is coming)
And when the shopping's done, get the stockings hung
We havin lots of fun (Christmas is coming)

[Random]
Word! It's gettin dark a little earlier
Mom breakin out the CDs that mean the world to her
I know, once I hear the Donny Hathaway
I know what time of year it is and I don't even have to say
another word, because the day is approaching
When fireplaces burn bright and presents are opened
Cards in the mail from old friends
And e'rybody's got a pep in they step from young'uns to old men
Nobody is miserable, cause even the misanthropes
love the smell of holly and mistletoe, yup~!
Tryin to sneak a kiss, city at a fever pitch
I would know it was Christmastime even if
I never looked up at the calendar
It's the only time of year perfect strangers stop and smile at ya
On the block, Christmas lights line the houses
Speakers on blast, no one minds the loudness
Kids squirmin like ants in the beds
While visions of the new toys just dance in they heads
But even if the snow don't fall
We bundle up and drink hot cider like it's proto-col
So don't y'all agree? Let your voices raise
Shake a hand, sing a song, rejoice and praise
Always, it's a special kind of cheer
that I only hear this time of year - it must be Christmas

[Phill Harmonix]
Aiyyo, yeah, aiyyo
The time of giving in the times that we live in
Men, women, and children, old folks and infants
A chance for presents, but also forgiveness
Nobody is perfect, we need to just accept this
It's time to get the decorations out of storage
Wreaths and the tree lights illuminate the porches
Kids wishes for gifts are dutifully recorded
Parents they find a way, even when the bank account is on
rigormortis, I see you and support it
Fat men in red suits, they join elves in chorus
It don't really matter what God that you pray to
or politics that you relate to, long as you stay true
to yourself, vibe with another when the day's through
Cause good stories, they never end, just ask Ateayu
You all fam, from the States to Japan
Merry Christmas, sincerely, Phill and Mega Ran

[Chorus]

[Random]
Word! We are a band of carollers
We march through the frost and snow
We may not care for the weather
But still on our way we go
At every hall and cottage
That stands upon our way
We stop and wave to the people
And wish them the best for the day
We wish you all a Merry Christmas
Made bright with Christmas cheer
With peace, and hope, and gladness
And all that you may hold dear
And for all those things that happen
to pass us along the way
We offer, a smile
And wish them, merry Christmas, today
Merry Christmas!</pre>
