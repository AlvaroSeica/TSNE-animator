(Talking)
Home sweet home
Let me take a drink of my fucking bud lite
Yo Richter, lite that joint yo X
Yo yo yo
Turn the porch light on

Welcome to the suburbs where the grass is green
Home of the mouthafucking Kottonmouth Kings
Where days become nights and nights become dreams
Where everything gets lost in between

(Johnny Richter)
Welcome to my block with the spot that I call my home
Where the locks are unlocked and I got cellular phones
Where the Kings was formed the true Kings is from
Sitting right in Orange County living under the sun

(D-Loc)
Growing up in the 'burbs
Where the herbs the word 
The herb herb herb 
You know the herbs the word
We as high as some birds 
You can use my turn 
Don't test Kottonmouth or your might get served

(Daddy X)
Now your gunna get served and a kick to the curb
Where this kings click stay and looks for some premium herb
Every day, every day, every body, outa mind
Take a trip with us with the sticky untied 

(Hook 1)
We rather get high more than one time
Never hit the shwag always smoking on the Ganga
Everybody gotta have a bong
We're drinking beer in the keg but I'm too drunk to stand in line though
When the Kings toke we're blown from the kind
My body's feeling numb I'm going crazy
Every body gotta have a bong (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

(D-Loc)
With my out grown caddi
Got the color of a cookie looking butter pecan 
'Cuz you know I can
Rolling away too cute on my way to Thrifties
'Bout to shoot a lil' hoops and get a scoop for fifty
I'm balling doo wa diddy diddy dumb
Throw it up in the burbs, drinking beers; having fun
And I'm always on the run with a sack in my pocket 
Kottonmouth Kings, yo we the hot topic

(Johnny Richter)
You can find me rolling in my truck just as high as fuck
You can find me hitting my bud on the way to the pump
You can find me in mid ank on my way to my moms 
'Cuz if I don't get high I wont be staying 'til nine
Ya see I'm puffing a Jays on avenues and high ways
I might be ripping off my foldable portable veins  
And I never slip at all I'm either smoking or drinking con
Ninety nine percent of the time I'm going outa my mind

(Hook 1)
We rather get high more than one time
Never hit the shwag always smoking on the Ganga
Everybody gotta have a bong
We're drinking beer in the keg but I'm too drunk to stand in line though
When the Kings toke we're blown from the kind
My body's feeling numb I'm going crazy
Every body gotta have a bong (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

(Talking)
Yo Yo Yo man growing up in the burbs
It was good you know what I mean 
It was five dollars an hour like me your done
From g's to ki's

Welcome to the suburbs where the grass is green
Home of the mouthafucking Kottonmouth Kings
Where days become nights and nights become dreams
Where everything ain't what it seems

(Johnny Richter &amp; D-Loc in this order)
Bout to get my buzz blooming
cuz it's close to noon double grippin on the blue 
  Steady sipping 'til I'm through
Cuz I ain't one to pound
  But can go all day
Loc and Richter never play
  Get it straight
Get outta the way
  You know, back in the day we built a late bed
  Only role it to the beach when it's double on the head
I go down to the west and watch some kamikaze runs
And if I'm outta joints I'm going home
  You're done hee-haw
I think I heard a donkey (donkey)
You a weird moutha fucka D; recently a seen a new look in your eyes
  That's me expanding my high searching for its eyes
Well I'm twitching my thumb and flicking any bitch
  You know I listen to my pops 'and call the neighbors fuckin pricks
Special hit from the streets
  Now you know when it's a lie 
Now I'm filling up my bong
FILLING ANY TIME!!

(Hook 2)
We're running outa money we're running outa time
Never hit the shwag always smoking on the ganga
Everybody gotta have a bong
We're drinking beer in the keg but I'm too drunk to stand in line though
We rather get high more than one time
My body's feeling numb I'm going crazy
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah</pre>
