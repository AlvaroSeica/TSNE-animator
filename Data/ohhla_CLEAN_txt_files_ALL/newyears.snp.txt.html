[Chorus: Marty James] (Snoop Dogg)
You're havin a good day, let's make it a great night
Been wantin to see you, and tell you you're so tight, yeah
My special lady, you're one of a kind
And every time I see you shine it's like the lights of midnight
On New, Year's, Eve!!! (Yeah yay, yay yay!!!)
I do be-lieve!!! (I do believe, on New, Year's Eve)
On New, Year's, Eve!!! (We can make it)
We can live (We can live, forever)
Forever (And ever)

[Verse One: Snoop Dogg]
11:59 and not a second later
She stay in the mix, like a crossfader
It's about to go down, no elevator
Live for the moment, love in the air
She got me feelin like I don't wanna be a playa
Real talk, so I don't wanna be unfair
Now watch the apple drop, and celebrate the year
Yeah! I see you shinin' way from over there
And all the other girls, nah they don't compare
I whisper somethin Bond to you all up in your ear
I infiltrate your mind, and then I penetrate her
I get it crackin baby, call me the cracklelator

[Chorus: Marty James] (Snoop Dogg)
You're havin a good day, let's make it a great night (Let's make it a great night)
Been wantin to see you (You know I see you) And tell you you're so tight, yeah
My special lady, you're one of a kind (You're one of a kind)
And every time I see you shine it's like the lights of midnight (On what)
On New, Year's, Eve!!! (Do you believe?)
And I do be-lieve!!! (You got to believe in somethin)
On New, Year's, Eve!!! (Can't stop we won't stop)
We can live (We can live baby)
Forever (Ever in a day) UH OH!!!

[Verse Two: Snoop Dogg]
Grab a glass, make a toast to the good life
Bacardi Lime and CÃ®roc help pass the time
Leather seats in the back of the Phantom ride
You stay on my mind so I had to make you mine
Master kush smoke, for a mastermind
My special lady, only one of a kind
I never seen it comin, I guess love is blind
New Year's, watch the city come to life
Yeah, I must say girl you lookin right
Your hair did, nails did, dress fittin tight
I think I just might, see she the one I like
See we can live forever girl, this is ours tonight

[Chorus: Marty James] (Snoop Dogg)
You're havin a good day, let's make it a great night (Let's make it a great night)
Been wantin to see you (You know I see you boo) And tell you you're so tight, yeah (So tight)
My special lady, you're one of a kind (Your one of a kind)
And every time I see you shine it's like the lights of midnight (On what)
On New, Year's, Eve!!! (Yeah, do you believe?)
And I do be-lieve!!! (You got to believe in somethin, why not believe in me?)
Then you, and, me!!! (If you and me)
We can live (And we can live forever)
Forever (Forever in a day) UH OH!!!

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah! I wanna shoot a shoutout to everybody out there celebratin
The new year, yeah, bring it in
Crack a bottle of Lambri', mix it with that champagne
And try New Year's Eve, the way we do it at a Snoop Dogg party
Yeah!!!!
