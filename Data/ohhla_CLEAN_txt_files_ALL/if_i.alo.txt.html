Song:   If I
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
If I sang a song
would you sing with me?
said if I sang a song
song, would you sing with me?
if I danced a step
would you dance with me?
(dance with me)
if I shed a tear
would you cry with me?
and if I told a lie
would you fall with me

[Chorus]
all of these things I do for you
give me a chance
to prove to you
my love is true

[Verse 2]
if I had to go
would you leave with me?
said if I had to go
go, would you leave with me?
if I had no food
would you cook for me?
(cook for me)
if I told a joke
would you laugh with me?
and if I asked for you to change
would you change for me?

[Chorus]
all of these things I do for you,
give me a chance
to prove to you
all of these things I do for you
give me a chance to prove to you
my love is true

[Verse 3]
if I had to die
would you pray for me?
if I had to die
die, would you pray for me? (would you pray for me)</pre>
