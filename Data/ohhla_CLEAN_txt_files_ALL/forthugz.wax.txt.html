(A Wax)
I was always on some other shit (I was always on some other shit)
I was just about to smother shit (I was just about to smother shit)
Then that bitch walked up
You wanna get chalked up
If not I suggest you kick rocks
Go a coupla blocks over where you can get rocks
Get rocked, entertainment for thugs
A few say it was rappin
Must claim it was drugs
That made it happen
Come threw slappin behind yellow tents
Bitches love it sayin gimme a blow
I was a penny from po'
Not many months ago
Lost my mom many blunts ago
So you punk'll know
I started writin it down
And if you take away my folks
I don't like the town

(chorus)
It's entertainment for thugs
They knockin A Wax while they slangin they drugs
It's entertainment for thugs
It's hard like the big yard they bangin like bloods
It's entertainment for thugs
They knockin J. Clyde while they slangin they drugs
It's entertainment for thugs
It's hard like the big yard they bangin like bloods

(Ridah)
Hoppin the year latest whip
Gucci force ones my kicks
Posin takin flicks
Hold up don't throw up yo hood in this
This goin to my lifers from Quinten to Wrikers
Is it the ridah standin next to the lexy on fire
Sent you a kite wit that
On how I almost died and now my llife is back
You see the white-gold smile on my face
Fa'sho it's ice wit that
I fly by in the night threw the same streets I coulda died in
A hundred times
Count my blessings clean my nine
See the times change
And my mind frame grew
Still the same lil nigga pants hangin drinkin a brew
In front of the dirty store
French braids resemble snoop
hustlin on school street when I shoulda been in school
But fuck that
It's entertainment for thugs
Now they knockin J. Clyde while they pumpin they drugs
Spin my record niggas dump in the club
Love is love
We all stars
Spit at the guard, one

(chorus)

(A Wax)
It's entertainment for thugs
By thugs
Brainwash fans to by drugs
Fly thugs
Brainwash bitches
I was actin like a squares she say I came off vicious
But still came off digits
Still wonderin why
Must've saw the benz wagon go thunderin by
Must've saw it at a stop sign
Not movin but the wheels still spinnin
When she thought about choosin
On Wax
