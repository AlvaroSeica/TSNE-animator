[Yelawolf]
Once upon a time in an apartment home
Lived a little girl with a heart of stone
Cause part of her heart was partly gone
Rarely seen and hardly known
Treated like a mat on a boxing ring
Blood drop stains on the twin boxsprings
Daddy came to visit, it's not a dream
She thought to herself "What is happening?"
Above her head is a crucifix
But Lucifer loosens up his wrist
Lays her down with an open fist
And all that was left was hopelessness
"Little girl, where's your loving mother?"
Under the covers, under the covers
"Little girl, what have you discovered?"
She stuttered, growin up in the gutter

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
Growin up in the gutter! No more, fairy tales, and so
No place, like hell, no place, like home
Growin up in the gutter! Black and white, in a frame
There we are, safe and sound, stray guns, no aim
Yeah, growin up in the gutter!

[Yelawolf]
And you ain't gotta be from the projects to deal with this nonsense

[Rittz]
Cause even in suburbia somebody'll murder ya
over nothin, leave your body slumpin in the parkin lot of your complex
Violence is a hard pill to swallow and digest
My town is full of drug dealers, most of 'em are shot in the process
Hustlin and stackin up profits
They robbin motherfuckers like they havin a contest
Shit, he took a bitch to his apartment to brag
A week later he tied her up on the carpet and gagged
Cause he showed her all the pills he had for sale on the low
She told her cousin then her cousin grabbed a Glock and a mask
Kicked in his door, laid him down then he shot him and dashed
Ran off with all that he had
Used to be ballin now he got a colostomy bag, what you know about that?
Middle class white bitch slingin her body for crack
Mexican drug cartels, you hear the buck shot shells
And then the blood clot fails - there ain't no healin the wound
Biggest meth bust on the East coast right here in Duluth
My lyrics are proof of growin up in the gutter

[Interlude: Yelawolf]
You think you can define how hard you got it?
By what neighborhood you live in motherfucker?
Wake up in the gutter!

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
... Slumerican indeed - I am
Drug through the mud like a weed - I am
Was a child who was beat - I am
Leather belts that made me - I am
Home alone again at 8 - I am
Somebody's life to rate - I am
Given to the beast by fate - I am
The one who did escape - I am
A voice for the cold in the dark - I am
The one who sold his heart - I am
From a family torn apart - I am
A target for your dart - I am
Sick again from the whips - I am
Head to the gun and click - I am
A soul that don't run from shit - I am
Exposed to the goats of sin - I am
Met a ghost and he said - I am
In the basement in red - I am
Dead cause the Ouija board said, I... A... M
