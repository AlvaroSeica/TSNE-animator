[Intro: Mali Boi shouting]

[Mali Boi]
I'm the grind luitenent, hatin cuz I'm wood grippin'
But I get in that ass, a good fifty, then they think I'm bullshittin
I gives a fuck, I'ma buck, fuck a pistol
I pop a ??? and flip the script on you and pop the trunk
Gon get they head blown, oh and he dead wrong
Fuck sangin the same song, shoot, took his last hope
Playin round with chrome mack, hot boy, you don't wanna get burnt
I know you heard about Mali Boi, fuck what you did, but I did work
If I was real, ????, makin moves like ?purple sticks?
You musta heard what I said, muthafucka, I knock you dead
5-0 town boy, how you thank you dealin with?
I kill a bitch day after day, ya'll niggas is full of shit
Paper Route they close em out, line em up, I take em out
You imme the word, I hop the bird and jump out with them five pound
I ride to die ho, I'ma let it fly ho
Tha shit you pull, that shit you pull, is what I'm gonna die fo

[Chorus 2X: Rubbabandz]
To all my New York, New York city niggas
Cali Cali killa niggas
Dirty South big wheelers
Midwest gangbangers, ride on em
Let's ride on em, let's ride on em

[Rubbabandz]
So ya niggas think I'm pussy? Oh they must've thought it was sweet
I wait till they push me, and then I started poppin that (*heat*)
Take my advice, start beating your feet, kick dust
Before the heat bust, I ride rough
You wanna play those games, you don't know how real it is
You don't know how them bullets burn when they hit your rib
I'ma show him how I live, take him to his crib
I'm off the chain with them thangs, I hope the Lord forgive
I got that big fo five on me Killas tryin to ride on me
And I got two kids, I gotta live
I got an extra clip on me, homei tried to creep on me
So I started dumpin on him and I spit a forty

[Chorus 2X]

[Interlude: Mali Boi]
What it do? Aight, What it do? Aight, What it do? Aight, What it do?
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up, throw it up
Throw them bows, throw them bows, throw them bows, throw them bows
You gotta get crunk, you gotta get crunk, you gotta get crunk, you gotta get crunk
What it do? Aight, What it do? Aight, What it do? Aight, What it do?
You gotta get crunk, you gotta get crunk, you gotta get crunk, you gotta get crunk
Throw them bows, throw them bows, throw them bows, thorw them bows
What it do? Aight, What it do? Aight, What it do? Aight, What it do?</pre>
