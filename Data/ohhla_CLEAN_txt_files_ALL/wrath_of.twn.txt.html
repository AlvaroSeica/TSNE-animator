[Lone Ninja]
Clash in the tabernacle, savagely stab and grapple
Tragedy, I carry thee axe of battle  
Angrily, attack your barracks in shambles 
Agony, you're slashed by the scattered shrapnel 
The rabid jackal, with no condolence
Grasp and strangle, I choke opponents		
Atrocious moments, are painfully depicted
Roam with coldness in vain the weak resisted	
Your fatally afflicted, lay and bleed
I'm blatantly sadistic, pray and plead	
Traitors flee, satan's deeds are sabotaged
Haven sieged, wait in trees with camouflage    
Palace guards, Lone and June'll hunt and raid 
Batter squads, foes are doomed on judgement day    
The hordes scream and shook with devastation
They saw scenes from book of revelation       

[June Marx]
Stealth assassin, my art form excel with passion
Everlasting, the war torn Peril faction
Vengeful action,craft and brung the sequel
Hunt the evil, poison in acupuncture needle
Lunge from steeple,wait to take foes on
Break both arms escape with smoke bomb
Spoke calm, I was born in the shadows
Expose harm
With a storm full of arrows
Alarming the castles with Lone, gatekeepers slept
Achieve respect daggers thrown at the chieftains neck
Secrets kept,within hidden cabinets
Wicked passages and forbidden manuscripts
Channel gifts, when we spar not to reap reward
Peace restored when we war with the demon horde
Seek accord, when I grab the weapon, Marx
Gone in a nanosecond,its the wrath of heaven</pre>
