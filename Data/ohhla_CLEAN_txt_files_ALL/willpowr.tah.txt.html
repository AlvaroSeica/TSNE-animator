One of my partners once told me that
"The only thing bigger than your will to do something
Is your will not to do something
And even that's the power of your own will

Man, Tahir, love life
Whether good or bad times
I'ma climb?
Make it all better instead of sitting around uptight
Looking down cos it ain't right
Whatcha gon do is the question
Mope around fessing
I stuttin nothing cos nothing stuttin me
When them chips get low
And I got no dough
Sleeping on the floor
Haters been poor and always will be
Cos I know my self-worth, haters can't kill me
See I realize that
Niggas need to ask themselves how they feel about that
Whether you trying to get paid
Or trying to get off crack
But you can't and you ain't unless you change that

What you think is what you will see
How you act is how you will be
Say it's hard and it never will be easy
Make a fist if you feel me
Chill if you can't
Nigga ain't and you will see

(Shaunda Steele-Williams)
Sometimes I sit back and look up to sky 
Asking myself why do I try (will power, will power)
Do we begin to unite

These pessimists
Cowards don't exist
Scared to take a risk
Turn around and be the first to make a diss
Try to keep it crisp and tight and let it rip
If it don't work, at least I tried
Hell I coulda died not satisfied
You said you couldn't but you lied
People don't try cos they petrified
Of what though
I ain't even worried about the po-po
And once we ??? them
There ain't a place that can't go
And bump takin things slow
Watching people shit from get-go
In my way-get blowed
In my space-get towed
Use shit as fertilizer
Make yourself grow and get wiser

What you think is what you will see
How you act is how you will be
Say it's hard and it never will be easy
Make a fist if you feel me
Chill if you can't
Nigga ain't and you will see

(Shaunda Steele-Williams)
Sometimes I sit back and look up to sky 
Asking myself why do I try (will power, will power)
Do we begin to unite

You better wake up, get up, and big on up
You better wake up and big on up
Say what? Wake up, get up, big on up
Wake up and big on up
You better wake up, get up, and big on up
You better wake up and big on up
Say what? Wake up, get up, big on up
Wake up and big on up

Start it off with a mix of sand 
Add water with the sun and some help from man 
Let the mix just sit 'til you get cement 
Then form a rectangle and you get some bricks 
And when you get bricks 
No need to stall 
Stack bricks real tall 
And you get brick walls 
Get a plan 
Keep it going til you figure things out
Work your plan 
Like you know it til you get a brick house 

Yea gon send this out to all political prisoners
Worldwide, know what I'm sayin
Behind enemy lines and on the streets
It's all the same game
To my nigga Oshawn, stay strong soldier
Cos when you get home, you know we got you dog 
Believe that

(Robert Williams)
True thinking is a deliberative act of the mind
Held fast to its task
Good or bad
The mind will bring into you life what you conceive
Strong will is the master of the body
Directed in the ? in the dictates of desire or reason
Will is itself power to bring forth the motive
On impluse that is strongest
Be it positive or negative
As is the mind, so is the will
Contemplate confidence and belief in your will
So your mind will be clothed 
With the power to have all possessions
Self-possessions, self-restraints, self-direction
And self-complusion to have anything you desire
The law of the will is the law of all rounds
Of symmetric character of self
God gave us a choice to direct thy will
And the power to be or not to be
The choices is ours-Willpower</pre>
