[Will Geiss]
Late night, hit the block, hoping I can make a knot
It's not, atleast got to get back to the spot, so I get popped
These are days, when a man becomes a man before he gets laid
Twitchy itchy trigger finger, snitches on the takes
From a cold cell, I can hear my momma heart break
And I hate to see her cry, that's why
I bought her that S5, ay
Corner after corner, one day, I'm gon' be a goner
All my life I've been a loner, and I know why
Too close is just too close
Even for my enemies, that's saying the kin of me, hells no
All a player want is some shell toest, couple bad chicks
Designer labels on my clothes
Fiends twitching they nose, it's like Sam on Bewitched
I don't want to refuse 'em, but I wanna get rich

[Chorus: Will Geiss]
There's no way I can lose
With my mind set on breaking through
If I go to the top, I'm taking you
With me...
We'll suffer bumps and bruises
You better wake up, got shit to do, and
Time to strap up, don't let catch you snoozing
It's time, and there's no way we can lose

[Solomon Childs]
Ralph McDaniels said you gotta have balance
That's why I speak with power, like a pilgrim
With blood on a Indian's malet
You know the Saints almost made it to the Super Bowl
But mama live in New Orleans and nobody built her a new home
We don't care about the kids, who can't go to school
Where's the carpenters tools, the young dudes
Is rebelious, wild, and follow they own rules
We can complain about our world, it's in shambles
But we pay for junk shops and hand dogs
We watching the talking of authority, gigabytes
A short of a wind thrust, technology claims
Taking care of us, but technology's the real destruction
From PlayStation to MySpacin'
And the government talking bout the evil that men do
Redeem the times, cuz the days of evil, come on

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
So understand something, boo
Baby this is Superman love, you done married a thug, right?
I knew you respect the game, of a hoodlum and his dame
Bringing the average couple to shame
Everywhere we go, people react the same
But they look so good together
They so educated together, New York Undercover
Remember when we reminiscened?
Getting raw ways in Raw-Way, catching tear threes with Jorge
You was upstate bringing me 'nuff noodles
Staten Island to Spanish Harlem
You was getting them packages, bringing it back to Scooter
The dirty guns in Bushwick, I had you doing
Everything, I apoligize for the conflict
But baby-baby, I love you
And always know that I'mma be there for you

[Chorus]</pre>
