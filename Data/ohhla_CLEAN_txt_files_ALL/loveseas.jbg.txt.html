Na na na na na na

I love you girl, like how we are
So when you get in that dress you look best by far
You look so smooth, looking so sexy
Girl why don't you sit right beside me
Scoot, scoot down baby and drink and chat
Every inch I get closer to you temperature gets a little hot now
Chemistry burning in the air
Can't quench it with no water [yes, hey]

Let's rewind, remember we fell in love with each other
Remember the long talks, the world felt it stopped, yeah
Now we can escalate, seems like we're already determining our fates yes girl, hey!

Love season is in progress, girl don't stress
Love's like a furnace on fire, not the average climax take you higher
So whatcha say
Love season is in progress, girl don't't stress
Love's like a furnace on fire, not the average climax take you higher
So whatcha say

Relax girl, it's time to take it sloooooow
Time to wind down and lay right here
Now all my eyes is stare
I'm talking 'bout pushing, rubbing, touching, kissing, sheets all messy babe
All up on th bed, the floor, the bath, or even on the porch by the front door
Yes girl, and when it's cold outside, I can be your fire
And when it gets to hot for you girl, I'm going down, down, down, down, yes

Body heat is gettin' higher on the double
You shoulda kept your mouth shut cause you are in trouble
Your body trembles cause you love the way I touch youuuu

So shatcha say
Love season is in progress, girl don't stress
Love's like a furnace on fire, not the average climax take you higher
So whatcha say
Love season is in progress, girl don't't stress
Love's like a furnace on fire, not the average climax take you higher
So whatcha say

There where a couple girls that I see and they looking so lovely
So I introduce myself, my name's J-Boog
And she ask how you doin'
And then the rest is magic all in the air
And I sing a song that sounds like this here, yes, oh

Love season is in progress, girl don't stress
Love's like a furnace on fire, not the average climax take you higher
So whatcha say
Love season is in progress, girl don't't stress
Love's like a furnace on fire, not the average climax take you higher
So whatcha say

Love season is in progress, girl don't stress
Love's like a furnace on fire, not the average climax take you higher
So whatcha say
Love season is in progress, girl don't't stress
Love's like a furnace on fire, not the average climax take you higher
So whatcha say</pre>
