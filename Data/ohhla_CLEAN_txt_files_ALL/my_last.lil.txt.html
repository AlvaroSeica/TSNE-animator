Typed by: AZ Lyrics

There's a lot of shit I'm still waiting for
Still wondering
Just, you know, crying on this notepad

[Verse 1]
Still waiting on healthcare
Praying on welfare
Gotta take my my hand up
Gotta move my mind in
Spend a lot of time there
Getting on my grind there
Throwing gang signs there
Got a peace of mind there
But I can't leave cause
I know a piece of mine there
People I grew up with
Don't wanna see me shining
So I grew up with a lot of things on my mind, plannin'
People do bad stuff
Wanna stay away from it
Got my mind right
So I won't sleep in the casket
See death around the corner
And life is in the basket
That's left from a woman, cause
The death of a woman
Means one less man
So give respect to the woman
I guess we just looking
If you could see how I see it
It's pain in your eyes, show em
Bleed how I'm bleeding
Just wanna talk, just one thing
Won't forget what you did
Just accept one thing:
I'm still waiting

You know there's so much in my life
I just feel like I'm still waiting
You know what I mean?

[Verse 2]
You could pick and choose
You could win or lose
You could sink or swim
You could stay or move
Just had to amass
I match the groove
I match the plan
I match the mood
Even though I'm from the hood
I'm a classic dude
Like Nat King Cole
I'm a faster blues
I have the blues, I seen the news
Can't go a while
Without seeing the food
Am I just a judge?
Am I just in love?
With this thing called life
Can I give it a hug?
Can I trust in thugs?
Don't hold no grudge
Niggas love to hate
But don't show no love
And that's old man thinking
If you closed-minded thugging
That's no man's hustle
No house, no home, no car, no budget
No Lord, no gun, but the ladies love him
It's Lil B

I'm still rockin', still grinding for the top
Let the bitch niggas know I won't stop, it's Lil Bars
Yeah, I still hustle from the bottom to the top
Let them muthafuckers know I won't stop

[Verse 3]
The hood feel like the invisible hood
I'm the ghost in the trees
I produce this wood
I rap on the tracks that make the block
Go crazy and the suburbs love me
Word to cousin
Right around the time I was hurting
Struggling, this dude had my back
Gave me motivation
I was asleep on the floor
In the midst of the haze,
Taking trips to the money
Paying for some changes
Things started changing slowly
Had the floor map
Even helped the homies
Got a new ride just to show the homie
Bought my main bitch a flight
Cause she say she's lonely
I don't love her, groupie's a bitch
That's word to Stunna
Shoutout to Birdman, that's word to Stunna
I touch down in the hood
I'm off the flight and blunted
It's Lil Bars, I'm hundreds...

Yeah, I'ma thank you for this trip in advance
This is my last motherfuckin' chance
I'm still waitin'</pre>
