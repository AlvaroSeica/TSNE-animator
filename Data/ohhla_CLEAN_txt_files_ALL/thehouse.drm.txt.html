Hook: Kim Boyd
Yes, we're here
The Dream Team is here
Oh yes, we're here
The Dream Team is here
Oh yes, we're here
The Dream Team is here
Oh yes, we're here
The Dream Team is here

[The Dream Team]
(Verse 1)
Ladies and gentlemen, have you heard
The Dream Team is back, so spread the word
Well, hit me on the one and don't delay
Cause The Dream Team is here and gonna make your day
We came here to kill, and this is our deal
If the music don't get ya, then our fly looks will
We gotta get it, what we got, even get us surprised
And what you need, you can jive alive
So without hesitation, you'll see what we're about
The L.A., Dream Team, is in, the house

Repeat Hook

(Verse 2)
Well, I'm over your radio once again
Rudy Pardee, I'm your best friend
Let's take it to the stand, you'll feel better about a pound
My name is Pardee, and I'm gonna throw down
In case you don't know who I be
I go by the name of a Snake Puppy
I touch bases to the fact, that I'm proud to be black
Do the best that I can with my fly girl band
So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Take this back into your world
Manipulate the situation with steady concentration
Then you know what we're talking about
But nevertheless, you got the best
The L.A., Dream Team, is in, the house

Repeat Hook

[Rudy]  Can you say "Yo baby, yo baby, yo"
[Crowd] YO BABY, YO BABY, YO
[Snake] Can you say "Yo baby, yo baby, yo"
[Crowd] YO BABY, YO BABY, YO

Bridge: The Dream Team
Join us here each week, my friends
We're sure to make you rock
With me, Pardee and Snake Puppy
Our rhymes will never stop
Fly girls, fly guys and the whole damn crowd
With a simple scream and shout
We want you all, to know that
The Dream Team is in the house

Outro: The Dream Team (Crowd)
Now everybody in the place, before we go
Is for those who did, and did not know
The Dream Team is here, yes, once again
We're about to make noise, til the party ends
For all the fine young ladies, let me hear you shout
SING! (DREAM TEAM, IS IN THE HOUSE)
For all the fresh young guys, let me hear you shout
SING! (DREAM TEAM, IS IN THE HOUSE)
Now guys and girls, let me hear you shout
SING! (DREAM TEAM, IS IN THE HOUSE)</pre>
