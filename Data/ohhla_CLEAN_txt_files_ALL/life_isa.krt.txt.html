[Intro: sample from Marvin Gaye's "Life is a Gamble"]
Life is a gamble, oh ohh, baby
Where you win or lose

("Li-li-li-li, life is a gamble")

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid] {K.R.I.T.}
{They said life...} ("Life, life is a gamble") So be careful when you 
shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
{They said life...} ("Life, life is a gamble") So be careful when you 
shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I roll the dice one time for my folks that died off
Rep the side they believe in but they side lost
Let me toss a seven for the ones won't see tomorrow
Cash those chips in for some time we don't need to ball
Gunshots ran out, everybody hang out
Yellow tape party, all over we sang out 
I don't like this feeling, ain't nothing that appealing
'Bout reminiscin, over you, my God
I couldn't cry cause your mama couldn't stop cryin
And that's hard, Lord I wish my folks would stopped dyin
But who am I to say it wasn't your time to black out?
You betted ALL on a spot I guess you crapped out
For the finer thangs, indeed we chase, we told your patient self
it's funny how the thing we love, can make us hate ourselves
Russian roulette table, I gotta bet safer
You gotta know when to fold yo' cards when you ain't able 
to reach into that dash when that, jackal up and flashed that
brass like, "Gimme all you got or that's yo' ass!"
That's all that it would took, the house got me shook
Cause ain't no point spread, but God doin books
Life...

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Life is a gamble feel like I'm ramblin sometimes
Like what the fuck I'm s'posed to say in this rhyme
I shed tears and they won't come back
I send word and they won't run back
My slot machine was broken this time
Ain't no tokens, I can't redeem to preserve the focus of mine
So many died and I'm scared it's just a matter of time
'fore I'm lifted myself, six people I know
Ain't been in church in a while, I heard I reap what I sow
Casket closed, Caddy doors, can't commemorate
This tracks my gurney, my verse can be the ventilator
So I breathe, cause +Loathing in Las Vegas+ wasn't meant for me
Too scared I'll stay too long and forget where I'm really meant to be
Heaven maybe, heaven lately, but all these lights are captivating
I had to play it, for the sake of me and mine...
Lord, I pray I hit it big this time
