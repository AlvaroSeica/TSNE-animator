[Begga Ooh]
I stash bones from the skin, mentally with the pen
I relate like kin, to the turntable spin
Hip hop lies within, I'm in front, to begin
With the rhymes to the beat, stick together like twins
Then again, no pretending, I'm defending my position
Like physician surgical splitting the mission
What if your position is sufficient
Bow down to the greatest, don't front
Cuz you not at your head when you played it
It's potatoes, cater your shit is gonna smashed
And get sent back, you can't keep up with this class
I'm teaching, basic training, weight gaining on the scale
And hydro planing over there, seeds, roller skating
Silver Surfer full of Persian, Himalayas to the dark side
Remember waiters, the ancient VCRs
The shell toe feet, the Converse all-stars
The my colored cars, the black movie stars
The 70's quitars, the old, cookie jars
Uncle Sickness...</pre>
