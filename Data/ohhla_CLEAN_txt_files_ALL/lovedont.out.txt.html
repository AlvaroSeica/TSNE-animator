(Intro) Planetary
Ayo Crypt, it's like the great depression in rap man
We need to get this shit back
Where the fuck did this shit go wrong
Who the fuck knows man

[Crypt the Warchild]
Yo, this game is fucked, everybody is thugged out
Everybody got a trey eight snub out
Everybody G'd up as a gang member
Everybody roll their trees up and can't remember
Everybody sip Yac, sip Patr√≥n now
Everybody flip crack on the lowdown
Everybody got a fly whip, six or seven
Everybody let it rrrat wit the Mack-11
Hip Hop is Dead Nas was right
I thought that I could bring it back wit everything I write
Nah, that don't neva happen, let it be gon'
I use to love it, where did we go wrong
50% doing it, the other half not living it
Who's real, who's fake, who's a hypocrite
Who makes, who takes, what's the difference
I admit to everything not innocent
Everything changed, I move wit the current
Stay up on everything, everything current
The love don't pay, Hip Hop won't
So I keep it real when y'all so I don't

(Chorus) Planetary 2x
The game just ain't the same no mo'
We just trying to maintain, man praise the Lord
For the love, young blood ain't the way no mo'
Say no mo', the love don't pay no mo'

[Planetary]
Seems like this rap game is twisted
Niggas is on stage wit tight jeans and lipstick
Too many chess boxes, no Bishops, Kings, Rooks, and Queens
Things look obscene
Uh, I'm bout to call checkmate on my check day
Wipe the board clean and release wit no said date
The love loss cuz the cost of living a lost cause
The cause is no one taught to children
Everybody wanna rap the same
It's like the record keep skipping on an neva ending train
It's like trying to be a picture wit a broke knuckle
Or trying to win a race wit no ambition or hustle
There's no muscle, maybe rap needs steroid
Maybe 50 was right that's why people are paranoid
And this is why all that love don't pay
Cuz all that nigga rap about is his cars and his AK
And all I care about is a bar on payday
And I still listen to legend and everything they say
But the way it is now shit's foul
Get out while you can, if not make hits now

(Chorus) Planetary 2x</pre>
