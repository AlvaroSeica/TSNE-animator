[Intro: Shawn Wigs]
That's right and fuck Bush
Ya'll hate Bush? I hate Bush too
I make my own future muthafuckas, that's right I did it, uh-huh

[Shawn Wigs]
Aiyo I star spangle bannered the mic, pledge my wealth
I had a, trust in God, but believe in myself
Cuz I could do it, I just gotta put my mind to it
No stopping me, I want the Boardwalk of this Monopoly
I want my kids going to the best schools possibly
And in this day, money talks, let's conversate
Got a seven figure digit, I'm looking to get eight
Possibly nine, I can smell ten in the bank
And there's a war going on outside, I push a tank
In reality, I need to have a big fucking salary
And bankrolls of cash is dropping like calories</pre>
