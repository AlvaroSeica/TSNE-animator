Chorus: Lil' Rob (Fingazz in background)
Hey baby, we've got ("All day")
And we can do this ("All day")
I'll make you say ("All day")
Oh baby ("All day")
And we can do this ("All day")
Hey baby, we've got ("All day")
I'll make you say ("All day")
Make you say

Repeat Chorus

[Lil' Rob]
(Verse 1)
We've
Got all day
We've got all night
Got time to play
And it's okay
To take our time
I love your frame, but I
Love your mind
I'm
Glad you're mine
Let's say a cheers, let's
Toast some wine
Now since we both can
Press rewind
Let's enjoy and take our time

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Lil' Rob
And we can take our time
And we can do this right
And do it how you like
We got all day and night

(Verse 2)
There's no
Need to rush
I love your kiss, and I
Love your touch
And when I'm gone
I miss you much
And when I'm back, it's such a rush, ridiculous
And when it
Comes to us
You slow it down, keep it
Gangsta up
We got all day
We got all night
Let's take our time and do this right

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

Bridge: Lil' Rob
Sit back, relax, take our time, and have a blast
And wh-when we make an ass, (???) no more time to pass
Take our time and do this right, I-I'll make you feel alright
Explode like dynamite, girl, we got all day and night

[Lil' Rob]
Day and night
D-
Day and night
Day and night, day and night, day and night
Explode like dynamite, day and night, day and night
D-D-D-Day and night, day, night, day, night

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook</pre>
