[Intro: ShoGun Assason]
Rum, murder one, this is for my murder
Where you at, murder murder ones
Where ya guns at, that crime time state of mind
Knowhatimsaying, feel me?
Where ya nine at? Too much heat
Where ya wine at? Where the fuck ya mind at
Yo... yo... check it

[ShoGun Assason]
Fuck the intro, this is for niggas who snort blow
Take one to ya left and ya right nostril
Til ya face sore, feel good, real good
Shit bang like, Alpine and Kenwood
Catch a dred, maintain, follow the same
Purple rain, numbing the brain, novacaine
Stain rap, feel that, got you trapped in a four corner room
Pocket feel big, you know it
Then he spit it, star sniff rid it
Cock it back and watch me spit it
Shitted on the clinic, feel me, if not, you get wit it
From out of high, drip drop, hip hop

[Beretta 9]
Willie Mays, Satchel Paige, Isaac Hayes with a blowout
Take a scenic route, we about in
Infinite dart split, don't quit
Get on a track, I flip, rollerblade, we the shit
Ask the Five, the babies, the fam, the ladies
We back like the eighties
Right like the Mas' new chrome, six-hundred Mercedes
Puffin' digi, dusted, dump off poliggy
You can hop over a curb like Kermit did to Piggy
On the freeway, black and we some heatwave
Hit the highbeems, they gassin' the replay
Button, ya'll niggas stop fronting
Yo, the shit is so fat, make you wanna grab something

[ShoGun Assason]
You play the killa, but we see a bitch inside you
Ya'll niggas wanna ride, but we can ride too
You blasting at me, then I'mma blast at you
Let's get it on muthafucka...</pre>
