(*talking*)
What's up nigga look, you know how we
Do it nigga, in New Orleans nigga, you know
Ain't no niggas like them Crescent City niggas, ya heard me
We got our own style nigga, and we got flavor nigga yeah
And I'm bout to let you know how we do it nigga
Every Sunday nigga, Uptown and Downtown ya heard me
Yeah, and it be real in the field nigga, check it out

[B.G.]
Now you know it be off the hook, at the second line
Them hot girls'll make you look, at the second line
You know nigga be getting shob, for the second line
You know a nigga be toting iron, at the second line
You know nigga tote 4-4's, at the second line
Nigga be walking getting blowed, at the second line
Getting full of that fucking dro, at the second line
You know nigga be on them hoes, at the second line
Nigga come through on Sprewells, at the second line
Send they people pictures in jail, at the second line
Everybody be having fun, at the second line
Till one nigga pull a gun, at the second line
You know a nigga know how to play it, at the second line
Cause a nigga'll bust your head, at the second line
That old nigga be jumping up, hitting the stop sign
I'm telling you, it ain't nothing like the second line

[Hook]
Washington and Forred on Sunday, they buck jumping
On twenty inches stunting, the second line's coming
Washington and Forred on Sunday, its going down
Ain't nothing like a town, like Uptown
On second left and Robertson, Sunday they buck jumping
On twenty inches stunting, the second line's coming
St. Fields and Robertson, nigga its going down
Ain't nothing like a town, like Downtown

[B.G.]
Nigga be walking with they click, at the second line
Nigga be even fighting they piss, at the second line
See if you hear them loud pipes, at the second line
Here come them boys on them bikes, at the second line
I be on Washington and Forred, at the second line
And I be strapped with that tech, at the second line
You know that it be going down, at the second line
Sunday my nigga Uptown, at the second line
Got to be on your P's and Q's, at the second line
Cause a nigga give you the blues, at the second line
Straight up knock you out your shoes, at the second line
Nigga will put you on the news, at the second line
You know there be a fashion show, at the second line
I hop out that new H-2-0, at the second line
Dog nigga be jumping up, hitting the stop sign
I'm telling you, it ain't nothing like a second line

[Hook]

[B.G.]
I swear its going down, man it be off the chain
Hoes be everywhere, I mean its a ghetto parade
You know a nigga thuggin', straight doing they thangin'
Got that pistol, ready to up it, cock it and bang it
Nigga bucking getting jiggy, strictly representing
When you come one time, you gon come again, cause you feel it
Nigga you got to feel it, got to like it and love it
Nigga you got to feel it, got to like it and love it
