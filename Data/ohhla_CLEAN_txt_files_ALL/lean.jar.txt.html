Song:   Lean
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
You put the codeine in the sprite
And then you mix it all up
Then you sip it slow
That's how them killas get fucked up
We call it
Lean, Lean
We call it
Lean, Lean

[Verse 1]
Bada-boom, bada-bing
White cup of lean
Blunt full of green
In the cut as I lean
In a cutlass supreme
Fuck with a team
Got her tucked in a jean
I'm a show you what I mean
When I cut a nigga clean, scalpel please
Throw a mufucker off the balcony
She don't wanna (gulp) when she give a nigga head
Cause she said that she's trynna watch her calories
It's the weekend
Let your hair down, swallow semen
She just wanna be my girlfriend
Bitch, wake up ho, are you dreamin'?
I got wife and I got children
I don't need you catchin' feelings
What the fuck these bitches sniffing
Cause you trippin'
Listen

Philippine, billie-jean, guillotine, ritalin
Drizzling, Jiggling, Ringaling, Niggaling
Chainsaw blade goes ring-ring
Get a motherfucker for the bling-bling
Bitch I'm on the lean-lean
Girl you on the same thing
Wayne ain't on it no more, let it go, I'm a bring-bring
Chain Flame, get a beat, it's drink
Gone off of mufuckin' sprite and promethazine

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Lean, on it
Half ounce, quarter pound, throw it in the bong
Nigga we, on it
You ain't gotta fuck it, you ain't even gotta suck it
Just pull out my dick bitch, breath on it
I often drift, where was I?
Lean in my cup and I'm feelin' so high
Dude get the keys to his automobile
And if he can't walk straight then you know we can't drive!
Lean it, swerve it, please don't let a nigga crash
Cause I've got a cab
Shoulda, coulda, woulda, never woulda been a coulda shoulda
If a nigga had
Throw up in a bag
Eastside, throw it on a map
Cut open a blunt, then I fill it up with hash
If I get the pussy, I'm a put it in a hat
I'm a pull it out her mouth, then I put it in her ass like
Cocaine, lo mein, propane, rogaine
Gold chain, no brain, Cobain, Don't mayne
Profane, no shame, slow vein, no vein
No lames, squares and no names
No limit, hit 'em with a tech and a gold tank
Ya'll niggas hate cause I'm doin' my own thing
ATLien, finding my own lane
Pop up and I soda pop the codeine

[Chorus]</pre>
