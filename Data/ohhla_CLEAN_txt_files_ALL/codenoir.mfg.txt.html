Rockin with Han Solo

[MF Grimm]
Can't take it no more
Broke in the window with some kerosene and some matches
Creeping quiet, silent riot, and then I just
Snuck in the room
As he slept I poured it all over the evil bastard
Strike the match, I lit him up, I held him down
Inhaling the fumes
We're choking from all the smoke in the house but I'm laughing hard
He fears dying so he's crying, yeah
Proving a point
Burning this house to the ground, yes I'm killing my master
Release of tension, find redemption, slave rebellion yell

This ain't no life here
Can't take no more
This ain't no life here
Can't take no more

Slaves in the field
They dance around from the joy cause they see all the flames
Steps are tribal, greet survival, defeat our rivals yes
House niggas are shields 
Some got the color but they are not brothers, they're traitors
Sell you out to live in the house, at you they're shouting no
Their fate is sealed
Try to defend master's property then we gonna 
Kill you off because you're soft and we don't need your kind
Weakness revealed 
Challenge us you will see we will be the winner
Fuck history, no mystery, this victory's ours
Proving a point
Burning this house to the ground, yes killing my master
Proving a point
Burning this house to the ground, yes killing my master
Proving a point
Burning this house to the ground, yes killing my master</pre>
