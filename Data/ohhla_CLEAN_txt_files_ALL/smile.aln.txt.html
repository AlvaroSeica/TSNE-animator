When you first left me I was wanting more
But you were fucking that girl next door
What cha do that for? (What cha do that for?)
When you first left me I didn't know what to say
I never been on my own that way
Just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the 'phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
It's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry
It makes me smile, yeah it makes my smile
At worst I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile I go ahead and smile

Whenever you see me you'd say that you want me back (you want me back)
And I tell you it don't mean jack (it don't mean jack)
No it don't mean jack (no it don't mean jack)
I couldn't stop laughing, no I just couldn't help myself (he-l-l-lp myself)
See you messed up my mental health I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the 'phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
It's only because you're feeling alone

At first when I see you cry
Yeah it makes me smile, yeah it makes my smile
At worst I feel bad for a while
but then I just smile I go ahead and smile

la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

At first when I see you cry
Yeah it makes me smile (makes my smile) , yeah it makes my smile (yeah it makes my smile)
At worst I feel bad for a while (feel bad for a while)
But then I just smile (just smile), I go ahead and smile (go ahead and smile)

la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

At first when I see you cry (when I see you cry)
Yeah it makes me smile, yeah it makes my smile
At worst I feel bad for a while (feel bad for a while)
But then I just smile (I just smile) I go ahead and smile (I go ahead and smile)</pre>
