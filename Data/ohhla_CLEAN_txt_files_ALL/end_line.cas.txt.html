Song:   End of the Line
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Every time you hear my music
Run a race and I'll finish mine
We just crossed the
Finish line
Had enough time to fix it
But it's over

Boy you overdid it
Way too much, too much, too much
Baby I was for you
In making this work
Now we're all broken up

End of the line
Baby are we supposed to be at the
End of the line
I see you and me at the
End of the line
End of the line
E-e-e-end of the line

We're over and done
But you're still telling me that you can't do right
I know we're meant to move on
So I'll just keep on running

It don't matter, it don't matter if you're coming back
It don't matter, it don't matter if you're coming back
You shouldn't waste your time
End of the line

Finish line
We just crossed it
We just crossed the
Finish line
And boy you know
We can't pretend it's not over
Cause

Boy you overdid it this time
Way too much, too much, too much
Baby I was for you
In making this work
Now we're all broken up

End of the line
Baby are we supposed to be
At the end of the line
I see you and me at the
End of the line
End of the line
E-e-e-end of the line

We're over and done
But you're still telling me that you can't do right
I know we're meant to move on
So I'll just keep on running

It don't matter, it don't matter if you're coming back
It don't matter, it don't matter if you're coming back
You shouldn't waste your time
End of the line

Finish line
Finish line
Over

End of the line
Baby are we supposed to be
At the end of the line
I see you and me at the
End of the line
End of the line
E-e-e-end of the line

We're over and done
But you're still telling me that you can't do right
I know we're meant to move on
So I'll just keep on running

It don't matter, it don't matter if you're coming back
It don't matter, it don't matter if you're coming back
You shouldn't waste your time
It's the end of the line</pre>
