[Intro:]
(Not feeling, Not Not feeling, Not Not feeling feeling feeling)

[Verse 1: Breeze]
Went the long way, no, took the wrong way
Flopped and dropped out of college like Kanye
I don't wanna neek, don't wanna stray
Had a fat pocket but crime don't pay
Just cos I let dreams go down stream
I was too busy with my Islander Cream
I was born to be a star it seems
So keep listening and keep your eye on my team
I've been, laid back from way back when
The big man I paid back from way back then
Having power turned my boys to men
And i'm a real man some bois pretend
Then again I never had shit to lose
Two of the feds were on me like shit to shoes
I had shit to move not shit to prove
Had two choices and I was quick to choose

(Not feeling, Not Not feeling, Not Not feeling feeling feeling)

[Chorus: Wiley]
Still griming, I work harder, (harder)
Roll Deep is the name and we will, (show you)
Roll Deep is the name and we will show, (listen)
Still griming, I work harder, (yeh)
Roll Deep is the name and we will, (show you)
Roll deep is the name and we will show you, (Eski Boi)

[Verse 2: Brazen]
Look I don't mind if you don't like me I will still be doing my thing
Whether you like it or not, you either like me or you don't
It kinda don't mean nothing to me though
Try and insult me, if I ain't got a knife I got a poll
And Ik now you wouldn't want it up ure a-hole
So if I was you I wouldn't give an opinion, when you might get beaten
You shouldn't listen to anyone just chatting to anything
When you criticise me you only boost my adrenaline
Who the hell are you to tell me you ain't feeling me anyway
I'm a young heavy weight, you don't wanna get weighed
And have you been mistaked maybe tell me what you take me fore
I've heard it all before, i'm waiting for it
Tryna take me for a boi I will not stand for it
I promise that when you see me again you will not get a warning
Cos I don't think your ready for me

(Not feeling, Not Not feeling, Not Not feeling feeling feeling)

[Chorus: Wiley]
Still griming, I work harder, (harder)
Roll Deep is the name and we will, (show you)
Roll Deep is the name and we will show, (listen)
Still griming, I work harder, (yeh)
Roll Deep is the name and we will, (show you)
Roll deep is the name and we will show you, (Eski Boi)

[Verse 3: Trim]
Roll Deeps the name and yeh Trims repping it
This is our zone so don't try stepping it
Every area code knows we're the best at dis
And if you don't know then your not from the residence
We're on paper dough, dead presidents
Whether it comes in paper, o's or white substances
Or from royalties, advertising and publishing we Roll Deeping
Some of ya'll cant stomach Trim, I'm from the streets
When I get something for nothing about my for p's
Pussy, paper, punk and plucking
Or some different reasons, i'll be ducking
Trim or Trimophy, trims on a far thing
If it's beef it's him or me so I first to buzz i'm

(Not feeling, Not Not feeling, Not Not feeling feeling feeling)

[Chorus: Wiley]
Still griming, I work harder, (harder)
Roll Deep is the name and we will, (show you)
Roll Deep is the name and we will show, (listen)
Still griming, I work harder, (yeh)
Roll Deep is the name and we will, (show you)
Roll deep is the name and we will show you, (Eski Boi)

[Verse 4: Jet LE]
Alright it's time
It's time for me a stand and make this thingy mine
It's time for me to stand and get into the grind
And take that energy and make it be mine
I'm kinda hot, feeling with some dodgy dealings
Tough like a batty toast that reached the ceiling
Hot like jerk but I ain't a chicken
Separate the real from the fake ones
Talk about the things that they ain't done
Or they'd like to, Put 'em on pause fuck it just eject you
I'm like the kid dats come straight from his final plans
Got my english got my grammar, punctuation is fine
Lets go see him like a cinema flick
But I ain't bringing my chick
I'm bring some kind of ready-for-it
Like a hammer when extended i'll be making the hits
Pay attention I will nail you

(Not feeling, Not Not feeling, Not Not feeling feeling feeling)

[Chorus: Wiley]
Still griming, I work harder, (harder)
Roll Deep is the name and we will, (show you)
Roll Deep is the name and we will show, (listen)
Still griming, I work harder, (yeh)
Roll Deep is the name and we will, (show you)
Roll deep is the name and we will show you, (Eski Boi)</pre>
