Typed by: Tha Masta

"We want... it... yeah..." &gt; vocal sample repeats throughout

[Fes Taylor]
Aiyo back then I used to do breakdancing and backspins
Chubby little fat kid, glasses with the cracked lens
Moms tried to keep me active, playing sports, living down south of New York
Everyday I fought so I ended up being suspended more than I attended
Rivals I came across always swore that I would get it
In the eighth grade I had the suede and tonics with the straight waves
Panasonic radio with the double cassette tapes
Fades with ya name in the back, chain with the Onyx in the back
Y'all niggaz remember that? (Yeah)
I'm talking DJ Red Alert days
So you don't know ya history of ya knowledge don't go past Kayslay
When the Nikes first added the Air, put bubbles in the soles
They said the revolution is here
Around the time Jordan came in the game
I'ma do it like, son I swear son this sport'll never be the same

[Chorus: King Just]
Yeah, yeah, come on!
Who that? Fes Taylor the Great
Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen, let's go!

[Fes Taylor]
When Kane wasn't Half-Steppin' and G Rap was on the Road to Riches
I took lessons, thinking how to better my profession
This is something new produced by the GrandDaddy I.U.
But I'ma take him back to the year ninty-two
When X-Factor terrorized the forty-six bus
I caught two cases in one week, walked away in handcuffs
Right before BlackFist Records became major
We already had an album done produced by Rebel Dainja
I was running in the streets wild like I'm invincible
Took one in the chest, still ain't think it's sensible
Freak Niq, mayor shut is down, I had pictures too
Baby moms found 'em in a stash in the living room
First came the Force MC's then it was Blue Cheese
Then came the Wu-Tang Clan, as the new meat
'Member the Shaolin Soldiers? Thought we was dead and gone
like Transformers: The Movie the way they did Unicron

[Chorus]

[Fes Taylor]
Let's take a trip, back to the public pool days, go and take a tip
Or the public school days when we used to skip
Go to Mr. B's, headed to a cup party
And hip-hop, this'll be my only love, probably
Listened to Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito
Bloods that was harboring 'em, Crips was popsito
When the Wolf Pack started then more and more people
Like we made it all balance out, kept it all equal
Around the time of the Shateeq scandal
We was writing over Gano D tags like a vandal
We was fighting over Jansport bags like animals
Pants sag but I never wore no MC Hammer shoes or no Kwame polka-dots
Nowadays it's Kanye polo tops, I used to drink Shaz to soda pops
I remember that... Starter hats with the strap in the back
'Fore dudes was rocking fitted caps

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
