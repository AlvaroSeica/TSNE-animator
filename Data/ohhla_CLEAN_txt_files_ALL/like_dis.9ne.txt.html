The Froggy Frog is ribbitin, all over the place when I'm kickin
and - ribbit, make you wanna hop jump pump mine
Ribbit - yo Nine, ribbit - hit it

[Nine]
I hit the wall like a wrecking ball
When I yes y'all, I stand tall, it's a free for all
You don't understand how I feel when I see that
screen and I see that screen and I FIEND!

['MC Froggy Frog']
Ribbit - I don't think you ready for the ribbit - steady flow
Ribbit - I came to go - ribbit Rambo
With the greatest ribbit - afro I got ribbit - toe
to ribbit - toe, act like you ribbit - know

[Nine]
I huff and I puff and blow marijuana smoke
I go for broke, I ain't no JOKE!
I'm massive, skills up the cooloo
Nine rises, like the sunshine, I'm CUCKOO

Chorus: {reverse MC order}

[Nine]
It's flavor, neighbor, next door, hardcore
Like Bolivian, white powder, I'm raw
Crazy original, still the incredible imperial
lyricist, can't nobody SEE THIS!

['MC Froggy Frog']
I'm sittin on the lilypad - ribbit
A fly goes by and I - ribbit - snatch it out the - ribbit - sky
Why would you - ribbit - try, you must want to - ribbit - die
Pass the - ribbit, pass the - ribbit, thai!

[Nine]
I'm gettin open off the hip-hop
Boots I knock like a pervert, more Casanova than Levert
So sweat me like a shirt, I'm goin bezerk
like DJ Red Alert

['MC Froggy Frog']
Ribbit!  It's that ribbit-guy, that you can't get a
ribbit - nuff of, I came to puff enough - ribbit - funky stuff up
Don't bite the Nine or the - ribbit - Froggy Frog
Keep bitin that - ribbit - "Atomic Dog"

[Nine]
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Bow wow yippie yo yippie yay

['MC Froggy Frog']
Bow wow -ribbit- yippie yo -ribbit- yippie yay
Bow wow -ribbiy- yippie yay

Chorus

['MC Froggy Frog']
I got - ribbit flavor, it's ribbit - major
I rip for the cause, ribbit - pause
Ribbit - bring it back, Froggy Frog the - ribbit revel
You dig me like a - ribbit shovel
I'm on another - ribbit level
One for the ribbit - bass, two fir the ribbit - treble

[Nine]
I am the Nine, and you are not
I flip the script, sell like a crack rock
I flip the script, you flip NUTTIN
Now who is the rudebwoy numba won raggamuffin?

['MC Froggy Frog']
Raggamuffin - ribbit, ragamuffin - ribbit
Ribbit - Six Million Ways to - ribbit - Die
I'm gettin - ribbit - high, drivin the - ribbit - 4x4
on the mountain, ribbit - steady bouncin

[Nine]
It's Nine and Froggy Frog hittin you thick
like a London fog dog
You can't see what I can see
So me hafa bring back, the pure Bronx, poetry!
