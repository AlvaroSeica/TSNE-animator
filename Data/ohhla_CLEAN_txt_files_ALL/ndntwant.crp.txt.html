Draped in powder blue
Walkin' through the hood, strapped
With the .9 millimeter, straight
Feelin' good, stroll
Over the Bradfield, on the other side
Where loc'd out Crip who gives a fuck about Bloods, ??
She strollin' thru my homies and my Crip swing
Kickin' out the Snoop fool 'cause it's a Crip thing
Do or die, Atlantic Drive, that's what I am talking about
Jigga happy trigger, finger straight taking niggas out
?Roamin'? and jet
?As a little of a twist? in and out here comes the .9
Cause it's puttin' in work time
And gon' see a fuckin' catch you punk Slob slippin'
I'm a B.G.
So I'm straight off for set trippin', B.G.
Abbreviated is: Baby Gangsta
Nigga step up
And you know that I'ma bank you
No time to hesitate
Yes, one-two-three
Over ?? you or biggety stomp out by me
The outcome
Is that nigga that got broke off
Loc'd out Crip
That's the opposite of soft
Niggas always strapped so I don't give a row
Atlantic A-D-C is what I'm always givin' up
So niggas C-ware of the notorious "Panic Zone"
Crazy S-B-G
By the way it's Mr. Gangsta Bone
Straight givin' up props cause the A.K. is up
S.S., N.H. and WEST SIDE NUTTY BLOCC, Cuzz
CARVER PARK and MONA PARK and EAST SIDE FUSHED TOWN
On these motherfuckin' Die-Rus straight gettin' shot down
TRAGNIEW, FRONT HOOD, POCKET HOOD, SWAMPS too
DUCCY HOOD, SIX-HOOD and ANZAC crew
?C-ZONE?, LANTANA and PARK VILLAGE
Compton Crips - comin' through
Makin' all Slobs killin'
ACACIA BLOCC and FARM DOGS and WARD LANE
Slobbin' bitches become on Slob on this ?jigga lane?
I can't forget about them niggas on CHESTER STREET
All my motherfuckin' homies from O-B-B-C
Straight blastin' on Slobs then killin' Die-Ru
This is the ATLANTIC DRIVE CRIP Cuzz
Comin' straight through fool

[AWOL]
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems with my hood
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems with my hood
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems

[SCARFACE]
I'm poppin' and I'm dumpin' all you Slobs with my 12 Gauge
At the young age I reached life for gangbangin' stage
Growin' up ain't givin' a fuck, known as the Compton nut
So I begun to shot in their face and bucked because they tried to duck
Niggas don't wanna see the S-A-F-A-C-E Atlantic Drive B.D.
The criminal minded Compton finest, no other can't see me
Cause I just had a fight and shank you bustas up with the .9
It's like a ?little knife? and everything's gonna C alright

[AWOL]
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems with my hood
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems with my hood
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems

Blue rag on my head with some blue Chuck T's
Pendleton Crip, blue khakis to my knee
Awol pulls up with the motherfuckin' stick
I took a couple of hits now a nigga wig a spliff
Now Awol put me up on some shit that went on
He said he smoked the Slob that was hangin' down on Sloan
I said what's crackin' 'Wol let's to put this shit - down
I know he was an Elm, let's go get a Fruit Town

[AWOL]
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems with my hood
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems with my hood
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems

[AWOL]
K's up
Another Crip face from the East/Side
Baby Gangsta down for the hoo-ride
Can't trust no P.O.G.
A Onion Head Coward or a Four C.B., uh
Elm Street, Lime Hood get crazy
Choke up on a fuckin' .380
Awol got it goin' again
K's up, hoes down cause I'm puttin' a point in
Swayhook wanna trip on a Crip
But the evil 'K was straight empty the whole clip
Can't mix with the Inglewood Faggot
Twinky Slob or Crenshaw Maggot
Fruit Town get clowned like Tree Top
See the block Lueders Park get the pop pop
Can't fade the young-ass B.G.
More prop when I'm sellin' in my K.C.
Khakis low, slangin' llello
But K's up I'm a motherfuckin' Compton loco

[AWOL]
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems with my hood
Niggas don't want no motherfuckin' problems...

[SCARFACE]
Yeah this is B.G. Scarface from South Side Atlantic Drive Compton Crip
You know I'm sayin'
We got my homeboys from Kelly Park, oh they in the house
My homeboy Awol, the Hun
My homeboys from Watts Franklin Square, the Fushed Town
They all in the house, you know I'm sayin'
And I got my homeboy
I wanna give a shout out to my homeboy Big Bun too
And my homeboy Gangsta Bone, I hear you nigga
S.B.K. a ??? drive
This Atlantic Drive and we're outta here nigga</pre>
