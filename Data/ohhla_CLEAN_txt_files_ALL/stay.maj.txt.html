Typed by: Cno Evil

[Madam Majestic]
In the eye of the storm..
You kept me warm... and I...
Won't... forget... you...
And the way you made me feel at the time...
In my heart... you'll always have a home
Althought you left.. me all alone...
Went away... and never returned... to show me love...

[Chorus: Madam Majestic]
Stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay (stay with me)
With me, love, love...

[Madam Majestic]
I can't believe you're here today
Picked up where we left off, before you went away
I never knew, that we would ever meet again
Stay with me, baby...
Stay with me, baby...
Stay with me, baby...
Stay with me, baby...
Stay with me....

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
