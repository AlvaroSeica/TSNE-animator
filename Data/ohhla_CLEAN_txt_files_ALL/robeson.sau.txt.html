[Intro: Saul Williams] 
Beginning with, the aftermath
sayers of sooth who stand aloof to hide their inner laugh
Depending on, the circumstance
I show my tools to where niggers know where I'm just a fishing pants

[During the intro] (Repeat 4x)
Yes yes y'all, you don't stop
Yes yes y'all, keep on

[Saul Williams]
I slept once, the dream has yet to end
It was a purple evening such as this
the curtains had been pulled by a hand unattached
I lay propped on a pillow of eagle feathers on a couch
framed with the skeletons of my uncles and great uncles
I did not intend to close my eyes, but when I did
The night is falling on the moist palms of children too weak to bear it's weight
The stars are visibly breathing in fact they almost look as if they are chewing gum
The moon is crescented on both sides while it's center remains unseen
I can faintly hear my mother calling me
or is that my sister singing songs of the railroad? [*During the intro starts again*]
Robeson is reflected in a floating mirror
Then I realize that the mirror is not floating, but being pulled by a white horse 
and in great golden chariot, the horse has human feet
I look down at my feet and they are hooves
When I look up it is no longer night
the sun covers the entire sky as if it were stretched to reach all corners
flames are visible but not threatening
A girl brushes my knee with her tail, she is wearing pink overalls and roller blades
she signals for me to follow her, as soon as I take a step towards her I'm flying..
There are rocky mountains below me, I decide to land in a small settlement between mountains
A man walks up to me, he is my father, but he introduces himself to me as John Galt
I ask him if he is the Reverend John Galt
We begin to say the Lord's prayer together, the whole world seems to join in
The mountains have mouths;
I am standing at an altar, it takes a second before I realize I'm getting married
The woman beside me, my bride, is sitting in lotus position on an Indian silk pillow
She is holding a white umbrella over her head, I cannot see her, 
I keep whispering to her, [*During the intro starts again*]
"It's okay love, it's okay love," and she keeps shushing me, and shushing me
I'm wearing a backpack, I decide to take it off and open it up 
It's filled with coloring books and I keep thinking
"I have to be done in time to pick Saturn up from school
I have to be done in time to pick Saturn up from school..
I have to be done in time
to pick Saturn up from school..."
My darling Saturn, I seem to break your heart daily, how could I ever neglect to hug you
You are a planet hugged by a rainbow, forgive me
I sometimes become so consumed in the travails of my own heart that I neglect yours
And there is no greater crime, I will never commit it again, for there is no other adultery
You are my child, God's gift to the world, God's will be done, I love you</pre>
