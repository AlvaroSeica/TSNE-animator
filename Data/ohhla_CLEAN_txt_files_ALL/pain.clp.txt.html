[Intro: Future]
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I don't never feel pain.. cause I done felt too much pain
Money goin' in the rain.. blood flowin' through my veins
I'm just doin' my thing.. get money, baby girl, gold chains
I don't never feel pain.. cause I done felt too much pain
Standin' in the rain.. blood flowin' through my veins
I don't never did a thing.. gettin' money, rockin' chains
We'll never feel the same.. we the thugs in the game
I don't never feel pain...

[Pusha T]
18 wheeler gorillas
Black with gold chains, pitch bird like steelers
Hines Ward of the crime lords
Running through this money screaming "Encore"
Spending nights with the prime whore
But that's the bitch that you're blind for
Celebrating on a whim, nigga
Pain is Pac, +Above The Rim+, nigga
My bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas
Cause she was there when it was dim, nigga
She wasn't fucking none of them niggas
So now we're even like a hem, nigga
Put your freedom over failure
Tryna find my Griselda
Might as well, they gon' nail ya
Momma screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and it's war
Pain is running out of raw
Pain is finding out you're poor
As the feds knock at your door

[Chorus: Future]
I don't never feel pain.. cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here standin' in the rain.. blood flowin' through my veins
I'm just doin' my thing.. gettin' money, rockin' bunch of gold chains
I don't never feel pain.. cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standin' in the rain.. blood flowin' through my veins
I'm just doin' my thing.. gettin' money, rock a hundred gold chains 
Been around here, blood flowin' through my veins...

[Pusha T]
Pain is joy when it cries
It's my smile in disguise
It's what makes the story chillin'
Spare the women and the children
Hear the scribbles of the villain 
YUUGH~! This is drug dealer brilliance 
{*siren sounds for 12 seconds*}
Pyrex on the platter like hot sex
But my tribe don't quest like love
Pain in this bitch, with a mask and a glove
And a team of lawyers to run the train on the judge
It's no risk without gain
It's no trust without shame
It's no us without 'Cain
Push, +My Name is My Name+
In the kitchen with a cape on, apron
Tre-eight on, coulda been Trayvon
But instead I chose Avon
Powder face like a geisha
Arm &amp; Hammer for the breakup
Turn one into two, watch the brick kiss and makeup
It's a match made in heaven,
All that's missing is the reverend
All that's missing is a blessing
I hope God gets the message

[Chorus]</pre>
