Hip-Hop can be about goin fishin
It can be about ADD since '83
Hip-Hop can be about goin out and drinkin with your wingman
It can be about, y'know, the dark times you spend
y'know in your youth, and anything you can relate to
if you're a human being
That's hip-hop, and that's what keeps - us alive
What keeps Rhythmicru and artists like us going
So... {*indecipherable yelling*}</pre>
