[Intro: Jeremih]
So I told her like, "Oooh-oooh darling
I feel like I am fallin 
I think I'm in whatever-it-is-they-call-it
I'm talkin 'bout loooooove
My friends say I'm trippin 
but, baby I don't really give a fuuuuuck
Pardon my French, girl, I just wanna know what's up?
(Ooooooh, oooooh, oooooooh)
I told we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

[Kristo]
I'm like, girl whatcha doin for today?
I'm thinkin maybe me and you should go and run away
And now I don't believe in love at first sight (nope!)
But after seein you, baby maybe I might
Cause when you walked by (by), I knew you were my type (type)
The apple of my eye (eye), you're flyer than a kite (kite)
Okay alright, I know that was kinda corny 
but (bu-) I'm just warmin up (-p, up)
Look at you, look at you all dolled up
Look at me, look at me getitn caught up
Goin down, goin down, yeah I'm shot up
But hopefully you got a number I can call up
And if you do girl, that'd be super
These chicks hot, but you're so much cooler (ha~!)
And I was hopin she would give me a chance 
She walked by and didn't give me a glance, damn!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I told her like, "Ooooooh, baby"
I'm so amazed by everything that you do
So I told her like, "Oooh-oooh darling
I feel like I am fallin 
I think I'm in whatever-it-is-they-call-it
I'm talkin 'bout loooooove
My friends say I'm trippin 
but, baby I don't really give a fuuuuuck (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
Pardon my French, girl, I just wanna know what's up?
(Ooooooh, oooooh, oooooooh) 
I told we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

[A-Wolf]
Yeah, I said, "Girl whatcha doin on the weekend?"
And she said, "I don't even know, depends"
But you're the one that I've been seein in my dreams
and, maybe we can get together in the evening
I know we just met, but fate I believe in
I know a spot where the stars just peek in
If love is deep, I'll put both feet in
Show me where the sea is, I'll be in the deep end
Ha~! Your beauty got me sinkin
Got me sayin all this shit without thinkin
I probably sound like I spent the night drinkin
Or these are lines that I'm always repeatin
But, it's the heart on my sleeve
that wanna know if yours might have a spare key
But if you're a heartbreaker then please spare me
Damn! She was apparently

[Chorus]

[Kristo]
In this light, you're lookin like you're in flight
Pretty voice, put a ribbon on your windpipe
Silly girl, you've been playin with me all night
But we can work it out, I been on my gym hype

[A-Wolf]
Yeah, I heard you had a boyfriend and stuff and..
I was just callin to tell you it's cool cause...
My other girlfriend got one too
Heh-heh! So I told her like..
