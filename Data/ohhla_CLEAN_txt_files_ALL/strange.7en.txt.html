[Verse 1]
Half past dusk
And we want to feel your soul
Lights out
Look out the window to the cosmos
And there we stand
Out of sight then back in focus
So take my hand
Either way, you can't control it

[Hook]
It can't stop
"They" don't stop
Here "they" come
Strange lifeforms

[Verse 2]
Back and forth
In the name of all that rocks
This might hurt
'Cause what we give is sure to shock
Waking from the fall
With feelings that you must have just been there
Writings on the wall
To let you know that we have always been here

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Black smoke
Dark chasms
No one says anything, waiting to embark on an answer
A thousand miles ahead, blinding lights form
With audio transmission from higher lifeforms
So we go to where the wild things are
Where the freaks make beats and do everything loud
And all things fresh is a must
And anything considered sub par is not allowed
Analog is the sound
And they feet never touch the ground, cause they always in the clouds
And you can tell by the scowls
That they believe that everything that comes up out they mouth is so profound
Fuckin' 'round might up the crime rate, cause by law they operate on a "Grind Date" mind state
Leave you feelin' outta time, outta place
Whenever someone has to leave, they mind got erased
So I stayed
Put the planet on hush and it's jammin' so plush, that they brand it Cold Crush
And ever since, I been a live wire, strikin' rhyme fire, can't stop
And they call it Planet Rock
