[Verse One]
I could confess that you're not enough
And that with others you must share
But when I reach for you at night 
I know you wouldn't be there 
...
I could reveal all my faults to you
The darkest corners of my heart
But would you praise me for my honesty 
Or would you depart? 

[Chorus]
I don't know where I should be
This game we play is killing me
She's all that I could dream
But she tears me apart 
...
She wants me to fill her need
She begs for authenticity
You don't want truth from me
You just want what you want 

[Verse Two]
If you could see into the future, love
And all the hell we have in store
Would you agree to sail with me?
Or just remain on the shore? 
(Just remain on the shore, get what you're waiting for)
You ask me for the whole truth
But for that you're not prepared
Refuse to be your enemy
Your fantasies I will spare, yeah...

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You just want what you want {4X}</pre>
