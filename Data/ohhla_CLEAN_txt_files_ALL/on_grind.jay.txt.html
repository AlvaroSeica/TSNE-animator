I'm rap hustling bitch, I'm on the grind hoe

[PJ]
What's the deal motherfuckers, hell yeah bitch I'm back
Tipping down the boulevard, in a Fleetwood Lac
I got the fifth falling trunk popped, acting bad on the cops
Candy blue paint, hoes bopping in the parking lot
Sitting sideways, purple stuff got me leaning
Flawless diamonds on my neck, hell yeah my shit gleaming
I'm a Boss Hogg Outlaw, I'm a Boy N' Blue
The Rap Hustler dick sucker, who the fuck are you
I'm a Boss Hogg Outlaw, I'm a Boy N' Blue
The Rap Hustler dick sucker, who the fuck are you
Boss Hogg Outlaw, I'm a Boy N' Blue
The Rap Hustler dick sucker, who the fuck are you
I talk shit, everytime I open up my mouth
H-Town Houston Texas, nigga down South
I'm coming up, can't nobody understand my plan
East coast West coast, a nigga got fans
Making change do my thang, hogging in that turning lane
Doing shows pimping hoes, pulling up on them swangs
Roc-A-Wear on my ass, Force One's on my feet
You a hoe I'm a G, nigga you can't fuck with me
Sipping drank puffing dro, spitting game to a hoe
Once I get her to the Mo', broads panties on the flo'
Ain't no simping in my pimping, ain't no whack off in my mack
Bitch can't say I'm worth a mill, if she ain't got at least a stack
White T's fitted hats, I don't wear no fucking suit
You niggaz riding in bullshit, I'm trying to get the Bentley coupe
PJ on my game, getting this money having thangs
Rap hustling motherfuckers, serving and collecting mayn what
