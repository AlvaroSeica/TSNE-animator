This river's red with the blood of the innocent
Spilled for generations
Perpetuated ignorance
Back from basic cables
Today's not the day for hesitation
Better act if you're able
World peace is overdue
Like overdose is over done
Understand in between the products and the problems
They're one in the same
Both gunning for pain at close range
There's no heart where the target's engaged

Change for a dollar?
That only makes senseless
It's time to build bridges and deconstruct the fences
The messages and actions don't seem to add up
You can subtract how many times you've divided and massacred
I came here to find some sleep by this river bed
And now I'm washing blood off my hands
Damn this river's red
If you don't want to be a part of the problem
You better be doing whatever you can to help solve them

Are you a battery?
Like a groove on a gear
Of a well oiled machine
Shadowing truth for years
When your friends are your enemies
Like your allies are your nemesis
They fight back with your own weapons
Life is precious
Destructions expensive and senseless
Families are torn apart relentless
Human beings degrade
Bank accounts inflated
Impoverished oppressed
While oppressors stay sedated
Television station
Manipulation information nation
Shit is evil
Essentially imposed on good people by defeatists
Elitists are elected to be leaders
They perpetuate political impediments
Really ain't no secrets
Living where the belly of the beast is
Dying just to wake up and unleash it

Whose coming with me?
Ain't no time to list the reasons
If you hear me, either stand up or be leaving
How we've been deceived
Misery loves companies
Blood money and greed

I take ten steps and I draw
 A line in the sand
Now you choose your side like a man, understand?
What you pick may not be in the plans
Who are you to raise you hand?
I take ten steps and I draw
a mural to the wall
We should make a hero of us all
I missed you at the final curtain call
Don't know which one of us went first
But both of us left earth</pre>
