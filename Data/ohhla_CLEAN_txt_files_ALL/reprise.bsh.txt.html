[Female Publicist]
What do you mean, you can still see it?

[Bushwick Bill]
I can still see the stars and stripes of the American flags
The stars which represent the badge of the oppressers
And the stripes which represent the oppressed who are held behind bars

[Female Publicist]
Well Bushwick, where should I pledge my allegiance?

[Bushwick Bill]
A-heh {*pause*} only God knows
Cause it all looks grim to me
Everyone who say they are, really ain't
It's like, it's like they all wear a mask, y'knahmsayin?
Which illusion is the ultimate weapon

[Female Publicist]
Is that the secret, that's hidden in the temple?

[Bushwick Bill]
Precisely~!
We all have to use our own, temple
to find out the hidden secrets within</pre>
