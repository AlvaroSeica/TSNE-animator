Typed by: graham212332@yahoo.co.uk

Intro

I just wanna wake up the world
Before I'm at my wake
I swear that I'll go broke
Before they see me break
When they see my face they'll know how long I waited
That I worked hard and made it

Verse 1

12 yrs old, standing on the corner where the pounds get sold
Everybody talking bout the hardhead Rome 'cause he just came home
His brother named Thomas, he graduated with honors, now he owe student loans
both of them pull up on the block where it's hot so much love shown
Thomas got pounds like "yo you doin' it big!"
but Rome got hugs like nobody thought he would live
4 years of college, verse a 50 month bid
and you can guess which one looked appealing to the kid
On top of all that, his cousin sold drugs, his brother liked to rap
he put 'em both together trying to come up wit some stacks
so he could stop shoplifting and get Moms off his back

Chorus

A kid goes to school what's wrong with that?
A girl holds down her dude, what's wrong with that?
You got a good job what's wrong with that?
Everyday you pray to God what's wrong with that?
You do your own thing
What's wrong with that?
You don't rap, or sing
What's wrong with that?
You got a good job, what's wrong with that?
Everyday you pray to God, what's wrong with that?

Verse 2 (Torae)

Want to know what's wrong with the youth?
Listen to the throngs of these songs out the booth
unacceptable, unbelievably uncouth
and they tell the tallest of tales talking that they the truth
dude your eyes glued to the videos and screens
so you think everything here appear as it seems
you copped a skull shirt and a chain for your jeans
but you won't enroll in school 'cause of registration fees
please, the bulk of these niggas you listening to
they ain't living what they spitting and won't listen to you
figure I get it how I live it, pay it forward and through
so I accrue what I'm out to pursue
you could swim out the sess pool you wallow in nigga
you ain't even got Twitter why you following niggas?
I'm hollering niggas, you should be ashamed of yourself
you gotta make your own lane for the fame and the wealth.

Chorus

Verse 3

Pac got shot 5 times and blamed Big
50 got shot 9 times and became big
Gravy got shot in the behind and became Big
now you thinking 'bout doin' the same sÂ—t
Jay sold drugs and made rap look easy
Jeezy sold drugs and rapped like he was Eazy
I don't know who sells the drugs to Lil Weezy
but if he runs the game, I say the game needs me
Soulja Boy said his music is fun
T-Pain's music is smart because it's dumb
That 12-year old kid from the 1st verse bought a gun
and said I fucks wit Pastor Troy I ain't trying to be Reverend Run
His Moms wants to know where the doe is coming from
he said shit ain't change 'cause Obama won
"tell your broke ass boyfriend I'm not his son
he working everyday for some pennies, I'm not the one imma get </pre>
