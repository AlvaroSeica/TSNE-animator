[Intro: DoItAll] (*Edo G) (**Masta Ace)
AIYYO ED!!!! (*WHATTUP WHATTUP!!!) AIYYO ACE!!!!! (**WHAT'S GOOD!!!)
WE TRAVELIN MEN!!!! (*Everywhere!!!) ROUND AND ROUND MAN!!!!
I THANK YOU FOR LETTIN ME TAKE THIS JOURNEY WITH YOU (*Yessir!!!)
DOITALL!!!!

[Verse One: DoItAll]
Aiyyo I'm sittin in the class with days in a duffle
I travel worldwide while you live in a bubble
Passport stamp like the mail then double
Ed and Ace with me (WADDUP Y'ALL?), Europe in trouble
To Paris, France, Malm√∂, Sweden
To that place, look like the Garden of Eden (It's BEAUTIFUL!)
Follow what I'm speakin, in Greece for the weekend
Find me in Holland, smokin and cheefin
Find me in Germany, drunk from drinking
Find me in Switzerland, or somewhere freakin
I go round and round, where you been recent? (WHERE?)
Layin in a hammock with a chick more than decent
It's DoItAll y'all, I escape from the precient
I do this, you do that - WE EVEN!
There's breath in my lungs so I'ma keep breathin
Wherever I stip, have a hard time leavin

[Chorus: Masta Ace] 
So many places where should I go? One for the money, two for the show
Airport, passport, travelin, yo, three for the music, four for the flow
Five cities down, ten more to go, round and round and round for the dough (UH!!!)
When will it stop, just don't know, one for the money, two for the show

[Verse Two: Edo G]
Yo, round and round in pursuit of my passion
Been in more places then you can imagine
Forget the hood and the dope slangin
I'm with Ty Phoo, out in Copenhagen
You need beats seek sick nature
Edo black out with Philly, when I'm in Croatia
But the 'berry got the best hood
We in London, choppin it up with Tim Westwood
Everywhere 'round the world we get mad applause
In Germany, we carryin sabotage
I could never get boarded fast, Paris France, Dany Bill, Lord Jazz
Watch A And E spazz lookin forward to the offerings that the world has
We do it all with DoItAll we at it again
Call us the travelin men, come on

[Chorus: Masta Ace] 
So many places where should I go? One for the money, two for the show
Airport, passport, travelin, yo, three for the music, four for the flow
Five cities down, ten more to go, round and round and round for the dough 
When will it stop, just don't know, one for the money, two for the show

[Verse Three: Masta Ace]
I'm on a world tour, with Edo my man
To the African Motherland, even Japan
Sign autographs in France, Steven and Dan
Check out the next date and we leave in a van
Passports and visas
Gotta check the overseas rate for the cost to reach us
Dial zero-one-one, plus the code
Shoulda hit us in the room 'fore we touch the road
'Cause now we on the Autobahn, off to the next (next)
Spot on the map, we collects more checks
Euro to the pound (yes), yuan to the yen (Yes)
I get more when I put my hand to the pen (Yes)
I get more when I put my voice to the beat
Summertime concert, rejoicin the heat
A&amp;E we'll put it down on your town
'Cause we travel around and around (Let's go)

[Chorus: Masta Ace] 
So many places where should I go? One for the money, two for the show
Airport, passport, travelin, yo, three for the music, four for the flow
Five for the sound, ten more to go, round and round and round for the dough 
When will it stop, just don't know, one for the money, two for the show</pre>
