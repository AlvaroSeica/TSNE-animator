[Verse 1]
It was like a Kodak, moment, frozen in time
Say, lady, won't you show me a smile?
Now wait a minute girl, you know you look fly
The same way you did back in Overbrook High
Truly divine, now show me a sign
I want you to remember, but you won't even try
C'mon

Do you really care? (Yes, I really care)

Who woulda thought that our worlds would collide
on the corner of 'Hello' and 'Goodbye'?
But I won't deny, I'm lonely inside
I know your face is in the crowd and she overlooks mine
and though I've got pride, you know I won't lie
The memory of you is still etched in my mind
C'mon

[Chorus - sung]
I don't really think I know you
But it's nice to see you
Again, someone that I barely spoke to
Yet today we seem like old friends
Do you really care? (Yes, I really care)
I wonder if I told you
We could go away some weekend
Oh so many things to show you
Here we go, no wait, that depends
Do you really care? (Yes, I really care)

[Verse 2]
Should I even try takin' a risk?
I see the years have been good to you, miss
This is a trip, I should see you like this
Downtown in the gallery, shoppin' for kits
Though you don't know I exist, I can never forget
Your perfect lips, and the curve of your hips
But, yo

Do you really care? (Yes, I really care)

So tell me, lady, what's been new in your life?
Is there another lover doin' ya right?
As for me, I've been around the world twice
Sunsets in Morroco, seen Paris at night
and many women for my every delight
but for life's eternal journey
You're the one I'd invite
C'mon

[Chorus - sung]
Can I be the one you're close to?
Would you tell me every secret?
Someone that you gave your heart to?
Baby, would you let me keep it?
Do you really care? (Yes, I really care)
I just wanna get to know you
Baby, now let down your defence
I would never try to control you
I'm the one you can feel free with
Do you really care? (Yes, I really care)

[Verse 3]
I wanna be the only one that ya trust
I hope ya know that this is more than a crush
Now let me show you if you're not in a rush
Exactly how much, I long for your touch
You shoulda been the one that I took to the prom
and those should be my children that are callin' you 'Mom'
But, yo

Do you really care? (Yes, I really care)

We would've made an incredible pair
Now, if we can't enjoy a friendly affair
Then every memory is meant to be shared
From the length of ya hair, to the scent that ya wear
They make me realise the chance that I missed
For us to embrace and share a passionate kiss
I waited ten years before askin' you this
But, yo

[Chorus - sung]
Is there someone else you chose who
Breaks your heart? Well you must leave him
There is no more pain to go through
Here I am, now love's in season
Do you really care? (Yes, I really care)
Listen, if I were to hold you
Would you hold me back, or even
if we're not in love like old fools
Baby, then we at least pretend
Do you really care? (Yes, I really care)
