Hello
	Hello?  Whassup, whatchu doin?
Nuthin whatchu doin?
	Nuttin chillin, thinkin about you
Is that right?
	Yeap, knahmsayin with them big ol' pretty eyes
	and that smile that make me crazy
	Man hold on right quick
(Bitch, come get yo' stuff, and get out, now!)
	Hey, hey I'ma call you right back in like five minutes
But who was that in the background?
(*keeps yelling, breaks something made of glass*)
	I'ma I'ma hit you right back, aight?

[Nio Reneé]
When I seen your face dere and held you in my arms I knew
that something had come over me
Been down this road before, deep inside I'm knowin the truth
I can never be your only one
You always got your lie, big, ??
Some ?? ??, and no other place for me
Who can't resist, the way that we kiss
Some sensual bliss - can't believe you gotta hold on me
Got me weak (can't speak) can't speak
Ohhhh noooo (you take my breath away whenever you)
get deep (get deep) into me (with me)
I can't believe you gotta hold on me, I can't
(got me weak) got me weak (can't speak) can't speak
(You take my breath away whenever you) get deep
(get deep) into me (with me) ohhhhhhhhh...

I have a part of you, and so does she and it's killin me
to know that there can be no we
Here I am confused and I don't really know what to do
You always satisfy my needs
?? ??? ??, ?? ??? ??
Cause I'll never give you my heart again
Who can't resist, the way that we kiss
Some sensual bliss - can't believe you gotta hold on me
Got me weak (can't speak) ahahahayayeahehahh
(you take my breath away whenever you)
get deep (get deep) and get dep into me (with me)
I can't believe you gotta hold on me, I can't believe
(got me weak) oaoahahhh (can't speak) ooooooooohhh
(You take my breath away whenever you)
(get deep) get deep into me (with me) ohhhhhhhhh...

I ain't never had a only one, won't ever have a only one
Young Blue put it down so cold out of five you'll rank as my #1
but still gotta have a little fun
I ain't never meant for you to fall like this
Got another broad that call like this
All I wanted was a little bit of time
Get with you to get away from mine love is a thin line
Now I'm livin a double life with her in the daytime
you in the nighttime
Never thought there was love like this
Never knew that you felt like that
Kept it low when we crept like that
Now you on the phone beggin fo' mo'
At the house, tryin to break in the do'
At the studio, bringin me bottles of Mo'
Make it hard for me to wanna say no
Eat a nigga, break a nigga the dough
Take your clothes off let me watch em fall to the flo'
I'll make you feel like neva befo'
I know it's done now when we dirty an ice bath
Makin love til your body fluids run down
How you feelin now?
Young Blue gettin deep with you
Young Blue gettin deep with you
I love bringin out the freak in you
I love bringin out the freak in you
