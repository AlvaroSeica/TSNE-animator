Song:   Mercy
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe! Believe!

[Chorus: x4]
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I'm in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me

I'm rocking, barely walking the valley of death
Fucker on cost a Lambo, you niggas in debt
I ain't want to fuck your girl, I just wanted a fresh
After BIG, Puff told me I was the best
Still is that drop nigga
Cocaine, Siroc nigga
Pull up on that yacht nigga
Detectors know I'm hot nigga
Hostile, mob style, rough childs
Trench coat, half cal, my dick hang to my caf now
Real nigga, I woke up with a kilo
Real bitch, keep kissing on my pee hole
Paid in full, bitch I think I'm Rico
It's Rosay, I sold food like C Lo

[Chorus: x2]
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I'm in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me

[Bridge:]
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe! Believe!

I'm in that Lamborghini drop top
Gunning for the top spot
Gold Rollie, my watch froze
You would think the clock stopped
Countin hella 20's, get into my dreams
Ballin with my niggas
Your girl gon fuck the team
Now I been off that Jameson so I might need her name again
I came to win, she's just tryna kick it like it's 40-10
Give it as she gon run it back
Her legs spread like a jumping jack
Her other man, he hella whack
And he don't stack it like Rockie stacks
Seen more clothes than a laundry man
More whips than cunta bag
Like racism, I'm a be around
Cigar niggas get used to that

[Chorus: x2]
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I'm in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me

[Bridge: x2]
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe! Believe!

Let the suicide doors up
I do suicides on the tour bus
I do suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in death jam building like I'm the shit
Tell em give me 50 million and I'm a quit
Most rappers taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass til it's up in your face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press key
Plus you're my bitch, make your bitch look like precious
Talk about Mary, she gon off that Molly
Navajo party, it's melted like Dali
Now everybody is moving their body
Don't sell me apartment, I move in the lobby
Niggas is loadin just to feel important
You gon see lawyers and niggas and Jordans
Now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane
Spit rounds like the gun range
Beat it up like Rampage
100 bands, cut ya girl now your girl need a bandaid
Grade A, A1, chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds backpack around me
Cosigned by Louis Vuitton
Horse power, horse power
All this Polo on I got horse power
Pound of this cost 4 thousand
I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain pourin', all my cars is foreign
All my broads is foreign, money tall like Jordan

[Chorus: x2]
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty
I'm in that two seat Lambo
With your girl she tryna jerk me

[Bridge: x2]
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe! Believe!</pre>
