[Ghetto E]
Uh, fa' sho'
Uh, uh, Ghetto E
Lupe, Spit Flames
Ghetto E the millionare
Flint town (I want the world)
Where the real killas stay
I want the world, uh
Puts it down like that (I want the world)
Uh, puts it down like that

Verse 1: Ghetto E (Bootleg)
Now, I'm attempting to rule this world (And everythang in it)
Projects with diamonds and pearls (So we can hang in it)
Life is a crazy game (That we must all play)
These niggas get bruised and slain (In project hallways)
Trapped in the pain and trama (Skinnin and conflict)
Still I'm survivin the drama (Criminal politics)
Motherfuck Reagan and Bush (We got the true potential)
Benzes and Beamers we push (And diamond plated dentals)
These lyrics are makin me famous (I keep it real)
While these rappers take dick in the anus (Of record deals)
I'm possessed with the ballers  ambition (To kiss the sky)
Plus I'm killin foes in competition (Before I die)
You don't I'm a hustler by nature (Look in my safe)
I gots a blow garunteed to awake ya (Broke down in eights)
Drinkin Dom 'til a nigga url (The sky's the limit)
A nigga out to rule this world, this world and everthang in it

[Chorus - Male and Female singers]
You know that I want it
You know that I need it
If I ruled the world and everthing in it
I want it, I need it (I'm attempting to rule this world)
If I ruled the world (This world and everythang in it)
You know that I want it
And I really need it
If I ruled the world and everthing in it
I want it, I need it (I'm attempting to rule this world)
If I ruled the world (This world and everything in it)

Verse 2: Bootleg (Ghetto E)
I kinda wanna be goin beyond (Just makin crumbs)
I'm investin in stocks and bonds (Mutual funds)
Had the meetings with business men (Discussing genes)
Flying tap-wit-me prostitutes in (From overseas)
Cuz I gotta get dressed, you know me (Some say it's evil)
That I'm pressin amendments for weed ('Til it get legal)
Where my bud smokin bitches at? (This is for y'all)
If you need a fat fifty sack (Give me a call)
I'm the G the haters envy most (In every town)
Obligated when I hit your coast ('Til I get down)
Either show me love or bring your heater (Hazyness)
Cuz these Flint town niggas be the (Craziest)
In my B-M-dub 7 Series (Ready to play)
Got a few sofa covers vary (From day to day)
Drinkin Dom 'til a nigga url (Sky's the limit)
A nigga out to rule this world, this world and everythang in it

[Chorus]

[Male and Female singers]
You know that I want it
And I really need it
If I ruled the world and everthing in it
I want it, I need it
If I ruled the world...</pre>
