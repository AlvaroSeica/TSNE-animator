 {Mystikal}
As long back as I can remember
when I was comin' up I was tryin' to git somethin'
felt like I didn't have nothin
(I had to)put in tha effort 
and tightin' up on my hustle
since spendin tha on
utilities and a mind musta
fish and chicken plate,macaroni cheez,green beanz
5 dollar supper
fuck workin menimum wadge
cause my feet hurtin' I'm musty
cause tha first time somethin' come up missin' bitch
start watchin'like I don't trust ya
and as hard as I used to work
find that shit
then i'm really fucked up
next thang you know
i'm assed out unemployed but I didn't do nothin'
try ya best to invest in my name but I keep strutin'
my financial situations gone be alrightjust gimme my check
bitch I aint stuttin ya
what ever got to do to keep focus keep from sufferin'
these niggaz don't understand
I write my tightest shit when times is tuff
sick &amp; tired of dreamin' bout' blowin' up
chances of makin' it glowin' up
seem like it aint gone happen to me either
rate i'm goin' slow as fuck
but never no worry
wit every reward theres a struggle
and every muthafuckin' come up theres a hustle
 (4x repeat)
 (chorus)

 {Master p}

so otha niggaz better feel
tha silence of tha land
