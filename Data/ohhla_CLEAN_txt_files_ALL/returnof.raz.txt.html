[Intro: Hell Razah]
Yeah, Renaissance Child, Heaven Razah
Raziel, on Earth as it is in Heaven
Wings up, yo, let me see your heavenly swagger
Ya'll do it like this with me

[Hell Razah]
Renaissance '76, some say heavenly sent
My pitch got my enemies sick
Now I'm back independent and clinch, a young black industry pimp
That'll flip more money that's spent
More flows for your memory chip, when I empty a clip
I don't miss the Kennedy hit
I'm Max Julian, the millionaire mind inside a hooligan
Got chicks that's Peruvian, that slip toolies in
Clubs and parties, the project Marcus Garvey
Turn the hood to the woods, or a dark safari
Spit games that older than the black Atari
Or I can upgrade quicker than a fast Ferrari
Still denim and gortex, but more or less I'm ready for war vets
No Rolex or homo sex, I wrote off debts
I slept with the tech in my polo vest
Go back like a Memorex tape cassette
But still I rep my project, back of the F
Red Hook got 'em shook up, that's for bread
Haunt niggas on the third day after my death
Amazing grace, I ain't with the Bathing Apes
A&amp;R's wanna hate, try to tell me to wait
Without a mixtape, don't make me spit in your face
Put this 40 to your head, make you dig in the safe
I'm the great Constantine, I carve the kings
I'm a Renaissance Child from my father's genes
Like Joseph interperting a Pharaoh's dream
Man, business affair better have my CREAM
Now the white man plan is to have my queen
I seen bosses with Maybelline on, ya'll sick of hearing
Brook-nam music, the theme song, I'm reborn
I'm back now, getting my eat on
It's Heaven Razah so be gone

"Now give me the cash"
	"I don't have any money!"

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
Yo, your physician got you worse than crackheads
Man with the plan get you needed them damn meds
The corporations controlling the airwaves
They on your brain you ain't nothing but they slaves
The feds reading your Twitters and your Facebooks
They be tapping yourself, tracking your smells, put you back in your selfs
On TV, every politican flips lies
And it don't stop, Amex porn sites, bitches lick cock
Ran paranoid at basic, the stereolization
Of so-called genetically inferior races
Nazis using your genetics to kill black babies
Who better me and Heaven Razah to take it back to the '80's
The boom-bip-bap and the bop of the rap, stolen cop car
Hopped in the back, popping a cab, they ain't locking a cat
Rocking a track, cocking it back, get popped
The doctor operating every drop in the wack
The White House digging through your e-mails
Entertainment industry run by homosexual shemales
The climate change is irrelevant, the global warming fear
Mine is climbing, ringing, the world government, ahh
Government poison is sown with chemicals
Humans beings being born with horns and tentacles
The program keeping you in your damn hood
Mentally raping you and taking your manhood
Lon Chaney, the Phantom, abandon your plan and examine the famine
Helping you preparing, I'm sharing awareness
I'm caring, I'm blam blamming the cannon like Yosemite Sam
And the Sunz of Man, and the Wu-Tang Clan, and the Rugged Man and
As a kid I wasn't interested in Transformers
Wanted to be like Rambo and shoot rocket launchers
Public relations creations, rappers get the Freemasons
Kissing dick for initiations, these are iffy situations
Felt good, did it sound as good?
Cool, I'm done</pre>
