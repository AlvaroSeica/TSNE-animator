Uh, Uh
Yeah
It's fly
It's Rick Ross
It's that L.A. Reid flow right here
Mario Winans (Winans, Winans)

Holla
Hold up

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I rhyme slow
Sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I buy blow
So I supply bricks (Ross)
Motherfuckers looking at me sideways
But can they tell I'm getting money five ways
Lot of leather, wood and the seats vibrate
Chatting with a bitch like your boy 'MySpace'
But she right here in my face
Take her to a fly place, with a fly fireplace
No marshmallows, we let the dro burn (burn)
I done seen the world, girl it's your turn
I told you lies all my life
But you hold me down, wrong or right
So it's only right she get that Porsche truck
All black black rims, call her Porsche
Let your weave blow in the wind
'Cause believe ever D-boy need a friend

[Chorus - Mario Winans]
When can we, get away and enjoy each other
Get away and explore each other
All I wanna know is
When can we, get away and exchange our feelings
Keep it popping like a move screening
I only wanna get away...


[Verse 2]
I'm in heavy dough
I'dont kiss every ho
So when I like a bitch, I enlist Mario
Feed her Larry-O's
Sip Everglo
With Gloria Estefan and Emillio (woo)
Baby really though, this your best bet (Ross)
It will be six O's in my next check (Ross)
With a gun in hand, I've also been a money man
Crack running man, fat Randall Cunningham
Look here, I'ma tell you like this
We need time to just kick it like this
She licking my lips, she diggin' my kicks
So we did it like this
It's Rick Ross
I'm the man of the hour
She love to make love, and we can in the shower
Back against the wall, I'ma stand like a tower
Everytime I'ma stand like a tower
Ross

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I rhyme slow
Sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I buy blow
So I supply bricks (Ross)
You can't look me in the face
When you wrong, I'ma put you in your place
My money long, I got money just to waste, girl
My money home, and it's up to my waist, girl
I really love how you shake girl
You like a 'Phantom', I love how you shake girl
Rick Ross, I'm a real nigga (real nigga)
You can feel the realness when I deal with ya (deal with ya)
Baby I won't lie to ya (lie to ya)
I'm too honest, I promise I won't lie to ya (lie to ya)
That other bitch finished wit (finished wit)
You the one I'm having dinner with
And it's candlelit
Can you handle it?
'Cause I can handle it
Well, lets handle this

[Chorus]

When can we...
Ohoh, you don't have to be alone, no not anymore
Baby when can we (when can we)
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go baby...
All you have to do is say yes to me
Say yes to me O
Say Yes to me baby
Say yes to me girl
Say yes to me O
Say yes to me baby
Say yes to me girl
And I'll do anything anything for you</pre>
