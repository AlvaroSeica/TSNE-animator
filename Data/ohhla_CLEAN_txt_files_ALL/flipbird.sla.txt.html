[Intro]
"In the kitchen" (put in work)

[Chorus]
("On a scale") "Flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird" {*7X*}
"In the kitchen"

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Said I'm here for money makin, I done lost 'bout all my patience
And beat almost all my cases, thought I covered up all my bases
Bitches try to play you 'til somehow someway you figure it out
You fuck with Jay-Z bitch from back in the day you might end up with +Reasonable Doubt+
You fuck with grimy bitches standin over you takin pictures while you sleepin
Cause you passed out drunk, after havin a threesome
That'll give you a reason, to trust no bitch, quit rappin
and just go get it crackin {"in the kitchen"}
'Bout to push that white instead of that music, seems like simpler profit
cause niggaz gossipin like they WorldStar, empty yo' bicep 
until I find you and empty yo' pockets
If 5'9" stop rhymin I'm drivin on I-9-5 
or I am {"in the kitchen"}
I will cop a ki' and put it

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Uhh... can't tell y'all
if I did drugs or if they did me, nah we was just doin each other
We was side-by-side like e'ry day, didn't care if we ruined each other
Back then it was so real, fully automatic it was overkill
I was on weed, I was on dust, might've tried coke when I was on pills
My pockets had rabbit ears, my mind gone, wasn't on bills
Whole family disappointed in me, can't imagine how that made my mom feel
Her one's missin, gun's hidden, sorry momma your son's trippin
Got baggies scattered {"in the kitchen"}
Plus, plus, you and dad was on the same road, y'all just left, made it right
If I ain't learned to do the same, pour some liquor say goodnight
Now I'm on this music shit, tryin to get this paper right
If not I'd be back {"in the kitchen"}

[Crooked I]
Let me get it now
On Twitter, they murder my mentions
cause they heard I was served by a circle of henchmen
layin in a dirty ditch, that bullshit is further than fiction
They personal mission's worse than snitchin, to any person that listen
Now I wanna kill a hater, a middle finger by the 'frigerator, flip a bird in the kitchen
Cause DJ Vlad, he was glad bullets went into me
Just to get traffic for his site, should've did him like MMG
But instead I called up Sway and we cleared that up on MTV
And now I'm back {"in the kitchen"} but should I be?
Cause I heard that Slaughterhouse is about to cop that Shady deal
I'm out here chasin that paper still; push kush, coke and crazy pills
Me bein shot online didn't stop my grind, nigga I don't mind
And if I don't rhyme I'm {"in the kitchen"}
I'll go cop a ki' and put it

[Chorus]

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh (yaowa) just when a nigga thought it couldn't get worse
The hurts reversed, scoop my cuz up after grandma left Earth
That recent shit, I was a young and bummy piece of shit cursed
No decent kicks cause mom kept enough of that snow to ski in her purse
No father, Jux passed me my first gun, revolver, with the serial carved up
Real showed me my first jump, I'm a barber
shavin the crack, after weighin the crack and then placin the crack 
in twelve 12's, I ain't play with the crack, I was makin up stacks
All day I just sat {"in the kitchen"} bringin it back
Now I'm tryin to do my thing with this rap, hope this works
Tryin to flip words so my homies ain't gotta flip bizzirds on the cizzurb
and black on a yellow belly coward on the +Steel+ like Pittsburgh
Lord I thank you for makin me able to find my way through
If not I'll be back on my momma's table {"in the kitchen"}
I will cop a ki' and put it

[Chorus]
