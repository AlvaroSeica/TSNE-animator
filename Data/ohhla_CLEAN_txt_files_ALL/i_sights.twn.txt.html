[Lone Ninja]
What gives?
I'm still hostile as the next, love lives
In sealed bottles of regret, novels of distress
Debacle, I'm artful with the texts
The harsh rule we're toppling the vets			
Harmful to ingest like a poisonous toxin
I'm poised won't get boxed in destroying your doctrine		
An annoyance to watchmen,invisible to radar
Invincible to danger, despicable so stay far			
The mean raider pose risk, remain atrocious
Fleets slained, elite aim in three planes of focus			
We slay with coldness the bravest hunters
Weak lames are hopeless their days are numbered			
Riot starter, The Lone Ninja violent
Stalker don't roam in alignment markers			
Propose a toast as the battle awaits
Was told that hope is the shadow of faith			

[June Marx]
Song of a lost soul, spirit with a torn past
Walk the crossroad, district with a long staff
Inflict calm wrath, different arms stashed
Erase all that existed with a bomb blast
Militant warpath, sign of fire fights
Adjust aperture, reallign iron sights
Strike precise, heed when the fuse sparks
Deceive,guaranteed to lose a few parts
June Marx, I rival your league
Sniper proceed to recite the riflemans creed
Tyrants will siege, destined to navigate
Weapons recalibrate end them at a rapid rate
Send men to blast the gate, its a hostile scene
Self luminous enhancement, optic beam
That'll drop regimes, force spherical
The perilous onslaught unbearable, Marx</pre>
