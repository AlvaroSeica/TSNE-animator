Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chester Bennington]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
was the one thing I couldn't find
And you were there at the turn, waiting to let me know

[Chorus]
We're building it up, to break it back down
We're building it up, to burn it down
We can't wait, to burn it to the ground

[Chester Bennington]
The colors conflicted
as the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
but couldn't stop from tearing it down
And you were there at the turn, caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn, waiting to let you know

[Chorus]

[Mike Shinoda]
You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right, to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn

[Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn, waiting to let me know

[Chorus]

[Outro: Mike Shinoda] + (Chester Bennington)
When you fall, I'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
(We can't wait to burn it to the ground)
When you fall I'll take my turn
and fan the flames as your blazes burn
(We can't wait, to burn it to the ground)</pre>
