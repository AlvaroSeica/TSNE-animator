(George Bush doesn't care about black people)	--&gt; Kanye West

(She take my money...)
I ain't sayin he's a gold digger
(...when I'm in need)
But he ain't messin with no broke niggaz
(She take my money...)
I ain't sayin he a gold digger
(...when I'm in need)
But he ain't messin with no broke niggaz
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like black people
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like black people
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like black people
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like black people

Hurricane came through, fucked us up round here
Government actin like it's bad luck down here
All I know is that you better bring some trucks round here
Wonder why I got my middle finger up round here
People lives on the line, you declinin to help
Since you takin so much time we survivin ourself
Just me and my pets and my kids and my spouse
Trapped in my own house lookin for a way out
Five days in this muthafuckin attic
Can't use the cell phone, I keep gettin static
Dyin cause they lyin instead of tellin us the truth
Other day the helicopters got my neighbors off the roof?
Screwed cause they said they comin back for us too
That was three days ago, I don't see no rescue
See, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Since God made the path, then I'm tryin to walk through
Well, swam to the store tryin to look for food
Corner store's kinda flooded so I broke my way through
I got what I could but before I got through
The news said police shot a black man tryin to loot?

(I gotta leave)
Don't like black people
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like black people
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like black people
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like black people
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like

(She take my money...)
I ain't sayin he a gold digger
(...when I'm in need)
But he ain't lookin no broke niggaz
(She take my money...)
I ain't sayin he a gold digger
(...when I'm in need)
But he ain't checkin for no broke niggaz
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like black people
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like black people
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like black people
(I gotta leave)
George Bush don't like black people

Five damn days, five long days
And at the end of the fifth you walkin in like, "Hey!"
Chillin on his vacation sittin patiently
Them black folks gotta hope, gotta wait and see
If FEMA really comes through in an emergency
But nobody seems to have a sense of urgency
Now the mayor's been reduced to cryin
I guess Bush said niggaz been used to dyin
He said, "I know it looks bad, just have to wait"
Forgettin folks who too broke to evacuate
Niggaz starvin and they dyin of thirst
I bet he had to go and check on them refineries first
Makin a killin off the price of gas
He woulda been up in Connecticut twice as fast
After all that we been through, nothing's changed
You can call Red Cross but the fact remains
that

(She take my money...)
George Bush ain't a gold digger
(...when I'm in need)
But he ain't fuckin with no broke niggaz
(She take my money...)
George Bush ain't a gold digger
(...when I'm in need)
But he ain't fuckin with no broke niggaz

(I gotta leave)
Come down Bush, come on, come down
(I gotta leave)
Come down Bush, come on, come down
(I gotta leave)
Come down Bush, come on, come down
(I gotta leave)
Come down Bush, come on, come down
(She take my money...)
George Bush ain't a gold digger
(...when I'm in need)
George Bush don't like black people
(She take my money...)
George Bush don't like black people
(...when I'm in need)
George Bush don't like black people
(I gotta leave)
Come down Bush, come on, come down
(I gotta leave)
Come down Bush, come on, come down
(I gotta leave)
Come down Bush, come on, come down
(I gotta leave)
Come down Bush, come on, come down</pre>
