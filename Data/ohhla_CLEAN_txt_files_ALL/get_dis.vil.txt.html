Chorus(2x)
Hey, hey, hey, h-hey, hey
What you say, get this money
If they say what you gon do today, just say
Hey I wanna get paid
Pay day, pay day, pay day(repeat)

(T3)
We dedicate this to these people out here gettin bank
Where the oops you loose the money its reali-tay
Never front on a click that you can't evaluate
See I got things out here I need to situate
I got a fresh ass car on some gloss paint
People walking down the street untill they feet stank
I got accountants out here handling big thangs
As i slip into the crib wit the sashay
Have my room wit the shark wit the big tank
Don't get mad cause I'm doing things you just cain't, cain't, cain't

Chorus 

(Jay Dee)
My man
 You need to get back like the rebate
And bid  he need to step up like the home plate
My man
Now what you know about the Great Lakes?
We contemplate on gettin money like a sweepstakes
Sippin dark grapes, party in the dark shade
You see a nigga cold chillin like a Marl-ey Marl
And bid his ride like a Harl-ey
Money make, a Ric, a Ric-o Suav-e, hey
Radio play the S like arcades
Everyday the holiday so nigga stay paid
Celebrate the holidays wit the money
Aint about to wait so nigga stay away

Chorus

(Baatin)
Somebody said that radio would never ever play
Some of that Detroit, Motor City for play
Honestly earning my dough, keepin it real ya'll 
countin my cash, just showin you how the boss ball
I never thought that we would make it up this far
Grippin my cream color Cadillac, North Star
Detroit Motor City finest is who we are
This is for my ladies who get out, chill at the bar(repeat)
When I was a young boy chillin in my daddys nuts
All I could hear was a rhyme and dope cuts
Growin up thinkin I was nothin, but a glut
Another day, another buck, another slut
All I wanna do is get paid
Oak town dont stop, stop, stop
