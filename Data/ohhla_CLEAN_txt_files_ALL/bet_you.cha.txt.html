[Intro]
Uhh, uhh
I bet you, won't
See, there's only one problem with them
I bet you, won't
And that's the fact that they're not me
I bet you, I bet you, I bet you, I bet you
Chamillitary man - I bet you, won't
If you ain't got a real "Elevate" CD
You need to come to Chamillionaire.com and see me
The Chamillitary O.G.
So as we get on to the proceedings this evening
You in the presence of the realest rapper breathin
Hol' up

[Chamillionaire]
Man these rappers ain't sayin nothin, every verse is a damn lie
Yo' position is pro-voice, my position is anti
Swear they tellin these stories to you, these rappers full of that Manti
Can't stop me, they can try, but I'm winnin that by that landslide
Y'all worse than that Titanic, it'll ship but it won't sail/sell
Y'all postin on snitch-agram, while you sayin you don't tell
These boys ain't got no stamps, they don't really touch no mail
I'm still tryin to get super posted, still fit up under but oh well
All talkin like "He the man," y'all softer than Peter Pan
So many fish in my fish tank and my crib she talkin 'bout eatin in
Call me up and she'll be to spend, got a money tree then pass me a limb
Play me hope we don't meet again, but my knuckles probably gon' beat your chin
Hit it off with my plan A, never needed that B route
I ain't never even shed a tear when anybody ever said peace out
Made it here with my freestyles, they ain't talkin 'bout free now
They always told me that money talks so I always got it on speed dial
Tryin to work and she tryin to play, treat the bank just like a hideaway
When I'm showin up it's like a holiday but I'm back to work, I'm not tryin to stay
A money day is my kind of day, very large is my kind of pay
Tell the vato I'm not the best, I bet he'll respond to you, "CÃ¡llate"
Wonder why I'm ahead of 'em, talkin down then I ended 'em
They tried to say that they only side but switch back and forth just like pendulums
Bought this trap and extended 'em, new cars when they rented 'em
Our old schools look so cool that you probably thought we invented 'em
Steal a heart but I'm no thief, style snatchin is so weak
You ain't gotta thank me for it, just show respect to my O.G.
Drop enough and you'll O.D., veteran but I'm code B
They keep sayin I don't drop so might drop another in fo' weeks
Chamillitary go so beast, freestylin on yo' beats
Gotta take it out of my two hands and that's the reason it don't leak
Two businesses out of state, no car that's out of date
I've been stuntin on them since '98, if you tryin to hate then you kinda late
Hit Brazil and take sleepin trips, groupies all on that freaky tip
Say good night and then take a flight, when I disappear you can't keep ya chick
Let me tell you how deep it get, this is more about keepin it
Take a pocket then sleep in it then I'll put the profit down deep in it
Yo' girl talkin 'bout orgies, rather go and get more cheese
Duplicate how I rep the state, we need less of them and need more of me
Spit a verse then it's for a fee, tried to do it but horribly
No trick-or-treatin, my clique is eatin, I'm feelin like I'm Chef Boyardee
Said their turn while they coppin, call me up, she say "Papi"
Knowin that I might score so they tryin to block me like we play hockey
Pockets got me like Gretzky, where the hell is my ESPY?
I Usain Bolt to that paper, go and go and tell them come catch me
Don't talk about financials, or tell me what your man do
Unless you got your own dough and you make enough cash to brag too
Hope your rent ain't past due, hope your shape is natural
Can't say you're a model if your last shoot was in yo' bathroom
Why everybody gotta be the same? Every group gotta be a gang
Every rapper gotta be a rapper and every rapper gotta be a lame
Love my jewelry then that's cool, she gon' catch a bad flu
But if my wrist ain't sick enough then my whip gon' make her "atchoo"
Everything happen for a purpose, obvious they didn't mean your verses
Every verse that y'all spit is worthless and they couldn't pay me to give you a purchase
Every verse they say Cham is rippin, say it's false if they tell you different
I'm still the Jordan, Grant and the Pippen of manuscripture, don't have me trippin
