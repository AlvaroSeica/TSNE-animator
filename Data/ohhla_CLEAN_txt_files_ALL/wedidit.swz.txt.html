Aowwwwwwww
Uh-huh it's on fire tonight
We are ready to rock this
We got Metallica, Ja Rule
Swizz Beatz the mon-ster

[Ja Rule: repeat 2X]
Just when you thought it was over
just when you thought it was done
just when you thought it was safe
Man we did it did it did it again

[Ja Rule]
Love fast cars, fast cars
Cause I'm a rock star baby, born in the U.S.A.
I'ma hit the highway on my Harley doin about 30
Slow it down takin it easy
Any woman that wont please me I'll give her up
Anything the rule touch give it up
And I know y'all are sayin man
They did it did it again

[Metallica]
More than this
Never more your whippin boy

[Ja Rule]
Yeahhhhhh

Let's go

[Ja Rule]
Hell Yeahhhhhh

Let's go

[Ja Rule: repeat 2X]
Just when you thought it was over
just when you thought it was done
just when you thought it was safe
Man we did it did it did it again

[Ja Rule]
Who loves a little rock, and, roll
Mixed with a little hip, hop, soul (we do!)
Come on rock steady, keep your rockers heavy
and say we did it did it again
Believe in the air ya breathin
Have a bad work we wanna freak ya weekend
No matter what ya spend cause ya livin it up
and damn if we don't do it again
Come on in baby bring some friends
We havin a party tonight
I'll bring the juice and gin you bring the Henn
Swizz we did it did it again

[Metallica]

Never more your whippin boy

[Ja Rule]
