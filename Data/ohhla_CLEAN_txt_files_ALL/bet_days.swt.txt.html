Do you hear me?
Tell me can you feel me?
Better days coming
For you and for me
Do you believe me?
Or do you just fear me?
Better days coming
For you and for me

ohhh hohhh hohhh

We pave the streets
To walk between us, we pay for these
Lock the doors and teach our kids to be neighbourly
Little defence to de-lineate A from B
We work 6 days
Come home and rake the leaves
They wanna save the trees
And free the ???
Only if they could see
Perceive the threat
We face at home
If only we could let
This make believe cease
And take the deepest breath

There's an unseen sickness in the air of despair
Terror ridden homes thats prone to welfare
Compare to the lush comforts of elsewhere
?Teens? in the suburbs, pretending we care
I swear, if you look at life in the positive light
And honour my insight, as long as my pen writes
Invite the whole world to be free, reality not just based on TV

Do you hear me? (But do you hear me?)
Tell me do you feel me? (Tell me do you feel me?)
Better days coming
For you and for me (for you and me)

Do you hear me?
Tell me can you feel me?
Better days coming
For you and for me
Do you believe me?
Or do you just fear me?
Better days coming
For you and for me

I feel concerned in the ???, ??? we all out, ?shit? just burns inside of me
Turn your head and earn your salary, its all just lies to me
We encourage you to listen to the truth, deeply rooted in the minds
Reward the illusion through the view of the blind
Very few are in the movement who refuse to define
?While the prove? that design?, in all due time

But if we sew these seeds, sew these trees
Gonna blossom all these leaves, and deep cedar roots
And as we carefully plan, to live and care for the land
In all, we share what we can, and you can eat the fruit
And when they tell us our lies, undercover disguises
We sever the ties and never be confused
And when we have to decide, to rise and gather the tribes
No matter the price, we will speak the truth

Do you hear me? (uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
Tell me can you feel me? (uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
Better days coming (uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
For you and for me... (uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
Do you believe me? (uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
Or do you just fear me?(uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
Better days coming (uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
For you and for me...(uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)

ohhh hohhh hohhh

(uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
(uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
(uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
(uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
(uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)
(uhhhh huuhhhhhh huuhhhhhh)</pre>
