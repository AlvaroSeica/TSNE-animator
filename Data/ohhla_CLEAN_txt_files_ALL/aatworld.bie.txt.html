[Justin Bieber]
You're beautiful, beautiful you should know it
(You're beautiful, beautiful tou should know it)
I think it's time, think it's time that you show it
You're beautiful, beautiful
Baby, what you doin? Where you at? Where you at?
Why you acting so shy? Holdin back, holdin back
We're not the only ones doin it like that, do it like that
So deejay bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back

[Chorus]
Cause all around the world
People want to be loved - yeah
Cause all around the world
They're no different than us...
All around the world
People want to be loved
Cause all around the world
They're no different than us

All around the world {*2X*}

[Justin Bieber]
You're crazy girl, crazy girl you should know it
(You're crazy girl, crazy girl don't control it)
Light it up, light it up, so explosive
You're crazy girl, yea-yeah
Baby, what you doin? Where you at? Where you at?
Why you acting so shy? Holdin back, holdin back
We're not the only ones doin it like that, do it like that
So deejay bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back

[Chorus] - the word "cause"

All around the world {*2X*}

[Ludacris]
YEAH~! Once again
The Dynamic Duos is back at it, hahahaha! JB, Luda
I love everything about you; you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itchin for beauty, but you're scratchin the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything could work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it, then don't give in
Cause hate may win some battles
But love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflects your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

[Chorus] - the word "cause"

[Chorus] - second half, the word "cause"</pre>
