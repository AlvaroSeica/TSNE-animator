Song:   Ever Really Wanted
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

And if you ever really wanted, someone to call your own
And if you ever really needed, while you were all alone
And time and trouble did you ever think that you would be with your back against the wall?
But now your older, so much wiser now, the one who wants to make the call
A little bolder now, cause while youre all alone
don't really know why you be holding on, to what was wrong
And if you ever really thought that you would be the one with your back against the wall
But now you rolling through like you never knew what it was to lose it all

And if you hear what the other man say, you better stop and see
And if you see what the other man see you know we must agree
And if you do what the other man do, oh lord, we cannot be
the way that we wanted, the way that you need for the one that should be

Have you ever really wanted someone to call your own?
Someone, something, some place, sometime!
We shove along, and live the life, when you need someone, someone to call your own
My brotha, my sista, its good to have a place for home

The lost and isolated, picking up the phone, but all I gets a ringtone
Ive got myself, but its always good to have a confident and a helping hand
cause we need each other, don't you understand well!

Hear what the other man say, you better stop and see
And if you see what the other man see, you know we must agree
And if you do what the other man do, oh lord, we cannot be
the way that we wanted the way the you need for the one that should be

We can hope for better skies and we don't see why others lie all day and night
you can't deny these things we've seen through others eyes
The long and windy road, is the road thats been less traveled on
I said the long and windy road, is the road you take while moving on

And if you hear what the other man say, you better stop and see
And if you see what the other man see you know we must agree
And if you do what the other man do, oh lord, we cannot be
the way that we wanted, the way that you need for the one that should be.</pre>
