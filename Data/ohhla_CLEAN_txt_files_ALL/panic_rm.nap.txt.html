Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: repeat 4X - quietly, then louder]
Everybody to the panic room
C'mon, everybody to the panic room

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
{You may try to stop my song}
{But my flow is way too strong}
(Crazy!) Everybody to the panic room
(Crazy!) C'mon, everybody to the panic room

[Verse One]
Yo, everybody to the panic room
C'mon, everybody to the panic room
Yeah we got bitches in the panic room
They givin out digits in the panic room
While the deejay playin I'ma get in tune
Turn it up louder and the planet boom
The country boy back and the planet's doomed
The band's in tune, your plan is doomed
The hardhead niggaz'll be dancin soon
All the good liquor that you can consume
The panic room, get'cha seat back right
And your chair tipped up cause we landin soon

[repeat 3X]
One, two, three, four (c'mon)

Everybody to the panic room

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Yo~! I'm off the chain like Gucci, looka there Mane
Keep it grain with the pure, take a toast of the pain
I'm goin "Crazy" like Cee-Lo Green
Fresh J's, Aviator shades, Gino green glow
Ooh, all across the land we go
In the last several months on the Earth I know
At least a half dozen fools tried to stop my flow
Fuck 'em all, multiply that by fo'
Then add a hundred mo' tryin to watch my dough
Triple that, add 50, now watch me blow
New situation every stop we rock
Some heard it was over and they thought we flopped
Nappy Roots is forever, shit ain't gon' stop
There won't be another year that we ain't gon drop (nope)
Holla at'cha boy, but it ain't no talk
Tryin to halt what I'm doin, watch the Glock go.. {*BLAM*}

[Chorus]

[repeat 8X]
One, two, three, four
{*after 3rd and 7th: Everybody to the panic room*}
{*after 3rd and 7th: C'mon, verybody to the panic room*}

[Chorus]

[Outro]
{You may try to stop my song}
{But my flow is way too strong}
(Crazy!) {The beat goes on}
(Crazy!) {The beat goes on}
Everybody to the panic room
C'mon, everybody to the panic room
Everybody to the panic room
C'mon, everybody to the panic room
{You may try to stop my song}
{But my flow is way too strong}
(Crazy!) {The beat goes on}
(Crazy!) {The beat goes...}</pre>
