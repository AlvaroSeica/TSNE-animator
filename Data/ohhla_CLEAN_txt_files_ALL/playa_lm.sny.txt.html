Is it true?
Huh?
Is it true?

(Chorus)
Is it true that you never had a playa like me
Somebody who can bone, make ya moan like me
Take ya home, get it on, all alone
You ain't never had a playa like me
Is it true that you never had a playa like me
Call when he leave, you know what I'll receive
Give it to ya can't breathe, in my heart I believe
That you never had a playa like me
Is it true that you never had a playa like me
Somebody who can bone, make ya moan like me
Take ya home, get it on, all alone
You ain't never had a playa like me

Tell me baby is it true that you never had a thugged out young playa like me?
Listen boo, I'm kinda diggin ya class and ya style, sexy smile
That says she invites me to come into a place
where another never came, but a lot of others wanted to go
She said I reminded her of a man she never knew, but always wanted to know
Then I was like hell yea is that right?
And she was like hell yea you that type?
Instead of lickin her lips, put her hands on my thighs
Tell each other how much she cherishs that night
Baby beggin for round 2, I'm like what you gettin round to
But I ain't trippin I was down too, take the bub, crack the crown too
Hit the lights in the lounge room
I'm tired a grippin on the gown too

(Chorus)

I remember when I met this hottie
Lookin at me lone, from the bar, she be the finest in the party
Lookin like molasses, sippin on champagne glasses
Tryin to play the role, she don't see a playa passin
So what up baby girl, I was shinin, iced out
Took her to the tele, I was givin it to her lights out
From head to toe, gigolo, no doubt
Made her feel real good till the minute I'm out
I had to ask have you ever had a playa like me
Somebody who can bone, make ya moan like me, get it on, real strong
Only ya man alone, I wanna see ya when your wearin a thong
Remember my number, I don't want the boy callin me
I'm too busy for the pre-school games, and I play for dames
You know what she told me, that I was cold, and my game was bold
And she ain't never had a playa like me

(Chorus)

If you call I'll come through
We can get it on
If you want me to, hit it till you moan
Bet cha never ever had a playa playa quite like this
That a finish up the night like this
After startin off ridin round town stressed
Stepped in the club best dressed
Tokin mad bud no stress
Kickin off dance floor sex
All my playa homies know whats next
Take her to the hideout, ride in, slide in
Vreak something, slide out, ride out
Drop her right back off at her guys house
I know she prayin that he don't find out
But I still be the one that
Take ya home, get it on, daily and nightly
Tell you what, turn you on, caress you slighty
Is it true you never had a playa like me?

(Chorus)</pre>
