[Intro]
WOOOO!!! Hah! Californ-a-ee
Sly Boogy! Hah!
Fin to make this crack, real quick
It ain't no problem, believe me man

[Chorus]
It's nothing, we drunk and - we buzzing
Tonight we gon be clubbing
This function - is jumping
Tonight I'm fucking something
We hustling - we thugging
Talk shit we gon be dumping
No bluffing - it's easy
Believe me man it's nothing

[Verse]
You might see in the back with a flask of yac
Swinging on it like I'm guzzling the glass or tap
Wit some cush' wrapped up in a plastic sac
With the finesse that the rest of these bastards lack
When I fall up in the spot, all the bitches pause
It's the nigga from the block wit the biggest balls
And there ain't too many niggaz that can fit his draws
And when he wile out, you don't wanna get involved
Cause it ain't no love and the slugs gon spray
When they close the club cause a thug don't play
And sho nuff, can really have a fucked up day
Cause I'm serving up more beef than a buffet
Oh yeah! Wit way more flavors than Now &amp; Laters
Wit some playas that's as crazy and shady as Al Queda
Uh huh! That specialize in laying down haters
If ain't now, it's going down later, believe me

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Nigga I'll snatch your car
Then back slap you for acting hard
Rat Pack you and mack your broad
And clap at you from handle bars
Wit a bite that's as bad as Jaws
Uh huh! Nigga you don't even have to like me
When it comes to being sheisty, I'm twice as likely
Jack your jewels if your ice is pricey
Snipe you wit the too-lz [tools] and swipe your wifey
WOO!! And get all up in your brain like witch doctors
I don't really need no chains and wrist watches
Uh! I blow like propane, you can't stop this
Wit more game than PS2's and Xbox's
I got some sexy foxes, breasts topless
Butter pecan 'Rican, banelas and plus chocolates
Yeah! All up in the Mosi feeling freaky
And when I say it's gon pop, believe me

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Contest that Budha blessed the best cheeba
No stretch, straight to the chest the best reefer
With the anesthetic effects of fresh ether
Jack up your leverage and mess your technique up
I'm dangerous in sex wit a ruff neck skeezer
Stocking up the medicine chest with lexzeva (?)
I bring the beef and bust, wet your team up
Then break out like flesh infected with eczema
Uh! I pull ho's and pour, then blow doja
Bulldoze over my foes and blow toasters
Book shows over the globe, it's our culture
Repping the West Coast and posing on posters
WOO!! I chin check when I come from the shoulders
And catch wreck when I come from the holsters
And clap the four-feezy and run
This is easy an 1 plus 1, believe me

[Chorus - repeat 2x]

Hah!!
