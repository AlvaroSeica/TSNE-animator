Typed by: AZ Lyrics

All or nothing, all or nothing

Show me a hand out, a domino, way to make it doubled up
Under on, this ain't enough, in case of beginners luck
Lost spy so I knew I had to have another goal
Now I'm on fire but I ain't gonna stop
Drop and roll, roll the dice, with me you're going to leave tonight
Today's another lucky day and I ain't even blast 'em
Our winter streets never felt so strong if I run
You can let it all on me, let's call in

All in and throw the whole lot in the lines
Days could have been higher
And only a liar would say they're happy with the second place
Let's call in, call in
Let's spin the wheel and roll the dice
Baby, 'cause we're on fire, and if you're sensing tears
Then you can let all fall on me

'Cause I want it all
Nothing in this world it's impossible
See, I never had anything and now I just want it all
And something deep inside makes me want more
See, I would do anything just to have everything
All or nothing
See, I never had anything, now I want it all
All or nothing
See, I would do anything just to have everything

I'm feeling something in me
'Cause me and lady Luck we've got so much history
Alakazam, imma turn pennies to fifty
I'll make shit spin like flying a freesby
If you're with me you should let me know
'cause you'll be sorry if you let me go
If you don't try, you'll never know
Up in the streets, never felt so strong
If I'm wrong you can blame it all on me

All in and throw the whole lot in the lines
Days could have been higher
And only a liar would say they're happy with the second place
Let's call in, call in
Let's spin the wheel and roll the dice
Baby, 'cause we're on fire, and if you're sensing tears
Then you can let all fall on me

'Cause I want it all
Nothing in this world it's impossible
See, I never had anything and now I just want it all
And something deep inside makes me want more
See, I would do anything just to have everything
All or nothing
See, I never had anything, now I want it all
All or nothing
See, I would do anything just to have everything

Look into my eyes and you will see the sun
'Cause too much just ain't enough
So we'll turn to gold, 'cause we are on our own
I'm preparing, preparing, preparing to own it all
I want it all, nothing in this world's impossible
See, I never had anything, so now I just want it all
I want it all, and something deep inside makes me want more
See, I would do anything just to have everything
All or nothing
See, I never had anything, now I just want it all
All or nothing
See, I would do anything just to have everything</pre>
