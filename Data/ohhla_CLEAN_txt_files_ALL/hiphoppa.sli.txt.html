Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Been so long since feelings left me
Soaked in mine been so empty
Looking for something,pretty and open
And where eternal love will survive

Set the night I've been dreaming
When I wake up I can't believe it
Love is not easy living without you
Don't wanna do it 'cause we won't survive

Singing blues, I'm hurting baby
It's been so long I'm broke and shaded
Take me far to my baby
'Cause she's running while
My tick is empty

Give that homeless begger
Stop your running around
A woman that you lovin'
She's ready to let you down
Let you down</pre>
