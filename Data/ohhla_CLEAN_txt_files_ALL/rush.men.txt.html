Chorus (Kangol Slim):

Won't you shake somethin'?  Twerk somethin'?
Shake it like a dog, now let me see you work somethin',
Won't you wiggle with it, get jiggy with it,
Drop it like it's hot, lemme see you bounce them titties with it,
Won't you shake somethin'?  Twerk somethin'?
Shake it like a dog, now let me see you work somethin',
Won't you wiggle with it, get jiggy with it,
Drop it like it's hot, lemme see you bounce them titties with it

(Sporty T)
Open the club door, straight to the bar, full stride,
It's plenty smokin' the potency is really hittin' the bulls-eye,
Look at baby doll with the full thighs, I gotta holla,
Fuck the Hennessey on the rocks, gimme the whole bottle,
Never unfold the dollar, my car be like the lotto,
Down South, ladies lyin' out, drinks on the house no doubt,
It's off the hook, soon as the party get done,
Watchin' shorty gettin' dumb, drinkin' Bacardi Rum,
That's annoying, movin' her tongue got me sprung like a set of springs,
I'm high off evergreen, thinkin' of better things,
We can do when you're done, doin' what'cha doin',
The night is young and you the tightest one every nigga pursuin',
But my plan's the ruin a nigga's game with no hatin',
I'm more bakin' them hoes locatin', ain't no fakin',
Started rotatin' the weed, now Shorty shake it for me,
It's her, cousin I'm lovin', now it's a party for three,
Bacardi and Hennessey, was ordered from the bar,
Two more feels on the door got me feelin' above the law,
Ready to play a broad, I'm in the, middle like mo'ney,
Ginuwine Pony, got them hoes feelin' up on me,
Like I was, Tony Tone Toni!, what's up with you homie?
Go to war lookin' lonely my dogs, R.I.P. 
On it, see I be hungry for dough,
Ballers, shot callers make them hoes rush the floor,
Rush the floor!

Bridge One (Kangol Slim):

Let 'em go, let 'em hang baby,
You got the thugs in the club now do your thing baby,
Let that G-string loose and then bounce that ass,
And bring that pussy over here and be about your cash,
Rush the floor let 'em go, do your thing baby,
You got them thugs in the club now let 'em hang baby,
Let that G-string loose and then bounce that ass,
And bring that pussy over here and be about your cash

(J-Dawg)
Somebody tell me where my niggas at?
With the bomb sacks of weed,
A dub sack of that fire, and it start my eyes to bleedin',
Soldier, blowin' dolja cold as an eskimo house,
You find them niggas who ain't bout it dog, then section'em out,
Special'em out, dirty South we ain't got no love for your kind,
Got me wonderin', how the fuck you get in the club with that nine?
Smugglin', Hennessey coverin', thuggin',
Would've won a lot of ways, nowadays, blood'll get you hurt,
We mob deep, the police about to be facin' a job,
Cuz "Tear Da Club Up" done came on, by the Three six mob,
But it's goin' down, when I'm out I'm tryin' to double my bank,
I'm posted up in the back with a big sack, and a couple of drinks,
Now all this weed smoke, got the club foggy as Hell,
And we don't need no, buzzards in the party so bail,
We hit the spot, like a Menace and we thuggin' for dough,
Buggin' for mo, I leave this party and start rushin' the floor,
Rush the floor!

Chorus (1.5x)

(Threat)
Dogg it ain't nothin' like a South side party, 
where you don't see too many cop cars,
Cuz ain't no two o' clock law,
Hoes be gettin' dropped off,
Spot's off the heezy, fa sho,
Home of the soldiers, New Orleans, for all who needed to know,
Whenever you in town, niggas smoke a blunt with us,
Because we put it down, until the sun come up,
The Big Easy, believe me we be down for rushin' the floor,
Bustin' the door with the pigs duck in the floor,
Rushin' your hoe is what you get for leavin' your bitch outside,
Unattended to by herself nigga, without no ride,
A club full of hoes in tight clothes it's goin' down,
No handcuffs, and they ain't got enough of 'em to go around,
Hold the ground, and I sip Hennessey with my doggs,
Pound for pound, niggas really don't wanna see me at all,
See me ball, Menace for life I'm representin' fa sho,
Rush the floor, don't be a sadiddy you lil' pretty ass hoe,
Rush the floor!
