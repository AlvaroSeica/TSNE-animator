[Intro: Pete Rock]
One two one two! N.O.R.E.! Uh!

[N.O.R.E.]
Yo! Yo Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yeah! WOO! Uh! Uh! Uh!

[Verse One: N.O.R.E.]
Yeah! You smell like pork like Kermit The Frog fingers
Know some bar lingers, they as hard as God singers (HUH?!)
I got a price on this chain call it Mark Cuban (WHY?!)
'Cause when we see the mark we 'gon snatch his cuban (DIE HUH?!)
Rick Rubin rockin rose shots gold pot (DOUBLE UP!)
Pyrex bakin soda killer combination (HA!)
Rob you for you safe kill your combination (DIE!)
Noah's Ark water flow congregation (WHAT!!!)
Night time hoodie on thick Champion
With cocaine do the opposite of ambien
Life's a bitch of layin in the sand
Boss +Rush Hour+ chinese, Rickey Tam
I heard that opposites attract though
Skinny bitches to a fat so, gas flow, that's low (WOO!!!)
My cuban niggas still not fans of Castro
With dictator ship still call him asshole

[Chorus: Pete Rock] (N.O.R.E.)
Yo! White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)
White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)
White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)
White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)
 
[Verse Two: N.O.R.E.] (*Pete Rock)
Yo! Pete Rock let the record stop
Yeah! Matter fact let the record drop
Jose Luis smooth obeisance, for my audience
Just straight through we ain't do recordiance
Legendary nigga legendary status
See the mic is like my wife, it's a legendary marriage
Whattup with +Mecca And The Soul Brother+ (*You already know!)  
Tell CL stay cold brother!
See it's the changin of the guard, these newer niggas want us out
These one hit single niggas and they always out
See I survive through the era of the shiny suits
Throw on them hardy boots and we had them army suits
Survive threw the B.I.G. and the Pac shit (Pac shit!)
Just think about that before you pop shit (Pop shit!)
Shootouts in front of radio stations doin this
We had to +Move Bitch+ like Ludacris

[Chorus: Pete Rock] (N.O.R.E.)
White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)
White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)
White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)
White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)

[Verse Three: N.O.R.E.]
Victor, P.A.P.I., Superthug, Slime Father
Melvin Flint, Jose, no way El Pollo Loco
Move the loco pollo
Black and I'm worth alot of money (Cha ching!) like some raw oil
Respect the techniquie but I don't battle rap
I put the metal to your head you could battle that
Split a riddle stuffed with a sour hat
I never sleep, I take power naps

[Chorus: Pete Rock] (N.O.R.E.)
White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)
White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)
White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)
White Guinness (HA!) Blue Heinekken (HA!)
Red Corona, take it like a vitamin (HA!)
