[Dr. Dre]

but you ain't sayin a motherfuckin thang
But my niggaz, I got my niggaz in the motherfuckin he-ouse
and they gon' tell you what's REALLY goin on
Got my motherfuckin nigga RBX -- definitely in this motherfucker
I got my nigga Daz in this motherfucker
Ready to kick some real shit, knahmsayin?
And that lil' shit you hear in the background -- that's my homegirl Rage
So RBX kick this shit

[RBX]
Seven execution style murders
I have no remorse cause I'm the fuckin murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
{***LOUD EXPLOSION***} I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped
One-time bust they caps and watch niggaz collapse
Snap!  Adapt to this, but you need no adapter
This is just the first chapter
in a book from a crook
You get caught slippin, yo' ass gots ta die
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure?
Trigger, happy RBX to cap ya
PUMP PUMP, and I can't wait to bust a round
PUMP PUMP, my hollow point smacks the clown
Cause what I said split his head
And now they got me runnin from the Feds
But I refuse to go alive
It's kill or be killed, that's how real niggaz survive
I'm high powered!

[Daz]
Yeah!
It's Daz that mass-murderin motherfucker
So what you feel like you wanna get caught up?
Fool you better recognize
Death Row came to chastise
So if you cross the Row
Remember the first name is Death
No love for the other side</pre>
