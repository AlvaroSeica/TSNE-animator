Marco Polo

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Took my card to da mall and I blacked out (ay)
Now my closet full of j's like a crack house
Ceilin so high you would think it was Shaq's house
Whip so big that it beep when I back out like
(beep) (Beep) ay yo tell that homie move
Its Bow Weezy Mr. Get em' wetter than a pool
I step up in a room
Bounce my ice where my chain be
All the fans be screamin like dey angry
Some call me cocky but how could ya blame me
And all da hoes like me because my money lanky
(yeahhhhh!) and im still da first to rock
(yeahhhhh!) first to put ice in a G-shock

[Chorus]
New G-shock (check)
Yellow lamborgini (bow)
BBC shirt witta fresh pair of jeans (wow)
Black card spendin when I hit the mall (studin)
You can't catch me im so ahead of yall

[Chorus: 12x]
Marco Polo

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Never been fake cause all the girls
Love official S.O.D cause girls love initials
Im on another level im in my zone
Black car white rims can dey both get along
This is not the Matrix but I am the oricle
Do you wanna get wit me the question is rhetorical
Say the sam lines but the fans
Arent bored of me, $7500 if you want to order
Hold on let me chang my swag
My flow board band yall boys dtill last
My whole click straight
Yall whole click fags
Last night ya girl forhead was on my abs

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]

You can't catch me im to far away

[Chorus: 12x]
Marco Polo

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
Man I make the girls go crazy
Dey wanna be my lady
How many can I fit im my two seatter Mercedes
Lime-green Lambo no roof thats a droptop
Dey hatin cuz dey grilfriends on my jock
I let her lick da rapper
Let her lick da acto
The next Will Smith, and I be
Ballin like the Raptors
If you don't want no drama in the club
Then don't act up
How can I run out
My money longer than a tour bus

[Chorus: Bow Wow]
Ay new (what) G-shock (check)
