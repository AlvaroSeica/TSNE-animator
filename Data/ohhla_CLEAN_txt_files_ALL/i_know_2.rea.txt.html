[Verse One]
Sometimes I can't stand you
Some things from your past is skandelousi heard all the lies
I can't handle it
I witnessed executions that you've put money on
And you still got the nerve to play that innocent role
I was there when the drug deals got exchanged
And your homeboyz came through and let it rain
Ooked in your eyez and I knew it was a setup
But you didnt say a word
You still let 'em bust
Im givin' up on this friendship
Your past is present
I been knowin' you since ten eleven
I'm movin past ya revin'
I knew ya ass when ya ass was smellinSso fuck all them stories ya tellin
You can say that you a boss
But shit...
I was with you in jail
And you took an oath never to tell
Nigga I know too much!

[Verse Two]
How can you even fix your face to release those lies
Your ass should die
I'll stick a ciggarette in your eye
Release the smoke
And then all the bullets'll fly
Ain't nobody from your syde that come as wicked as I
I never knew I should've let your ass inside my circle
My words'll hurt you
Whip you till your ass turn purple
And dissapear like the ghost man
Flyin up the coast man
Get rid of the gun
And all that extra ass contraband
Storm like quick sand
Grip em like pits man
Fuck the love
I tell it like it is man
I'm like a steel toed boot inside this hip-hop battlefield
I fuck with the don
Cause them niggaz know a niggaz real
Probly be killed but to feel like I feel is to be real
Aand every nigga feel like I feel
Ain't no kiss-ass nigga I dont ask 4 shit
And imma still do the same whether im poor or rich
So to every mothafuka that I helped get a deal and gave a few thousand to help
pay a bill
Imma show you mothafukaz just how real is real
Ill give the word and watch how many bodies are killed
Exacutioner, cut 'em quick and fast like a guillatine
Taught by the best on how to exercise on triple beams
As cold as me, I dont know too many that can flow like me
Thugged-out, but ya bitch'll want me like im jodeci
Fo' sho its me a south-ass nigga
You gone notice me, stay drunk and fucked up nigga
Like im post to be
Patrollin me
Leanin to the syde like an older G
Keep ya eyez on me mafuka
Cause I know to much!</pre>
