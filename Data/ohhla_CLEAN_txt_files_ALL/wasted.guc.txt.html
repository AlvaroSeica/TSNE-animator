[Intro]
Uhh
Ha {*4X*}
Ha! (I'm wasted, so wasted)
Ha {*4X*}
(So wasted) (FATBOI!)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rock star lifestyle, might don't make it (wasted!)
Livin life high, every day clique wasted (wasted!)
Sippin on purple stuff, rollin up stanky (wasted!)
Wake up in the mornin, ten o'clock drankin (wasted!)
Party party party let's all get wasted (wasted!)
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked (wasted!)
I'm so wasted, she so wasted (wasted!)
Tell the bartender send me twenty more cases

[Gucci Mane]
Trippin like Whitney, gettin like Britney
Gucci no hippie, but it's on like Jimmy
X pill poppers, geeked up crazy
Whole clique rollin, everyone's wasted
Purple codeine, Sprite pink, don't waste it
Mix it, grandma drunk it didn't taste it
Now grandma sippin syrup leanin wasted
Walkin 'round fuck up twistin her fangah
Homegirl slipped up drunk got wasted (wasted)
Now she back stage and she tryin to get famous
She be off the drinky drinky, Gucci Mane shake it
Club night, damn right, Gucci Mane wasted (wasted)

[Chorus]

[Plies]
I don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm lookin for a bitch to suck this Almond Joy
Say she got ta stop suckin cause her jaw's sore
Got a bitch on the couch, bitch on the floor
The party just poppin up but now he rollin more
Rolled on three pills, now he on four
I don't know why, but that Remy turned me into a whore
Walked in the club, pocket full of big faces
Got that forty on my waist and it's off safety
'Bout forty goons with me and we all wasted
On Remy straight tonight dog, no chaser

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
My whole clique faded, we geeked up crazy
Big boy bracelets, we white boy wasted
No shirt, fuck it, unless your arms is tatted
We sloppy drunk disgustin, and liquor gettin wasted
285, Eastside, me and Plies wasted
Racin, seven big booty broads chasin
Spring break, fifty thousand white girls shake it
Some dancin naked, but everyone's wasted
Magic City Monday, ball players wasted
This one for your uncle drankin Thunderbird wasted
Twelve pack wasted, I need more cases
And Gucci not a racist all my diamonds Caucasians

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! This is GPSA, yeahhh
Ghetto Public Service Announcement
Takin over a little club near you
We don't get fucked up no mo'
We get wasted
Gucci Mane, Plies
FATBOI, we wasted</pre>
