Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Diddy]
You niggaz paranoid, I party, getting money
I know I'm the shit, my janitor be getting money
I got a skyscraper, it's a hell of a view
Got me closer to God, angel wings on my coupe
Pray for me; damn, I grind every day for it
If you see me riding in it, it means I paid for it
Bugatti Boy, one point eight four
I got money, baby - I could order eight more
Fuck the Forbes list; let's tell the truth, I ate more
I got a billion, baby - time to get me eight more
Twelve bedrooms, time to get me eight more
Stack all the cases of Ciroc up on the eighth floor

[Chorus: Rick Ross and (Diddy)]
Got a hundred mil'
(It's time to get another one)
How this Bugatti feel?
(I may need me another one)
Five bad bitches
(Just got me another one)
P. Diddy run the city
(Never be another one)

Five mil' cash
(And I need another one)
Rocking a different Rollie
(No, it's not the other one)
Second to none at getting money
(Nigga, number one)
Real niggaz run the city
(Never be another one)

[Verse 2: Diddy]
These haters speculate
They always watching mine
She know what time it is
Just like my watch line
My clothes line
The cologne, bitch
I know you smell this money, sitting on this throne, bitch
I'm strong, bitch
I own shit
Gave myself a ten-digit bonus
I'm the money man
Money never financed
Come get this money, baby
With your fine ass

If your nigga broke, it's time to get another one
If your bitch is tripping, time to get another one
I'm Puff Daddy, bitch - there'll never be another one
Bugatti Boys forever one

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm feeling the money
I'm loving the paper
Nigga hating the hood
Took his ho to Jamaica
If I let down the top
Let the breeze in my beard
V.I.P. is the spot
They playing musical chairs
My Colombian the man, all the beam-me-up shorty
Got that money in the bag that can hold a fucking body in
One point five for this brand new black Bugatti
Jewels like I'm Slick Rick, Bally shoes, la di da di
Feeling myself; bitch, you do the same
Fuck what I spend at the bar, you should see how I came
My bitch had a vest, with one foot in the trap
If I bust at your chest, I bet that's a wrap

[Chorus]</pre>
