Chrous: [Mr. Marcelo]

No ifs, no ands, no buts, no whys
Represent the Third Ward, 'til the day I die
Cause I only got love for my ghetto
and if you niggas don't know now you know
No ifs, no ands, no buts, no whys
Represent the Third Ward, 'til the day I die
Cause I only got love for my ghetto
and if you niggas don't know now you know

[Mr. Marcelo]
Life in the bricks, man it ain't all what it seems
Some niggas come clean, but other niggas remain lost in they dream
You understand?, you can relate to what I'm livin' in 
It's so bad, nigga can't even make a dividen
Cap and get killed, what they say on the news
New Orleans , Louisana, another nigga sang the blues
Picked up trail, we 'bout to slam it in the gutter
I just lost my brother, now who gonna tell his mother?
As the day goes on, man all I hear about is killin'
&gt;From a soldier to a warrior, from a gangsta to a villian
They say they understand about all this shit that we go through
But at the same time, they can even relate to
The shit that goes on in my hood every day
What I hear before L.A., the sounds of a K
They say they understand all this shit that goes down
Livin' like a dogg, Magnolia is my pound
My stompind grounds, so I dodge alot of bullets and shit
But everywhere you go, you take this chance of being flipped
I been 'bout my bid -- since the cradle
So look me in my face, and tell me I ain't able
Survivin' in this city is a pity, you can see it
This place that I'm in, none of you niggas wouldn't wanna be it
The game of life is full of trades and tricks
Alot of you niggas out there, wouldn't survive in the bricks

Chrous: [Mr. Marcelo]

No ifs, no ands, no buts, no whys
Represent the Third Ward, 'til the day I die
Cause I only got love for my ghetto
and if you niggas don't know now you know
No ifs, no ands, no buts, no whys
Represent the Third Ward, 'til the day I die
Cause I only got love for my ghetto
and if you niggas don't know now you know
No ifs, no ands, no buts, no whys
Represent the Third Ward, 'til the day I die
Cause I only got love for my ghetto
and if you niggas don't know now you know

[Mr. Marcelo]
Life in the bricks, it ain't shit like it used to be
It used to be, unity, now it's poverty
But ain't no stoppin' it, young black man, comin' up
It's like, gun in my waist, and knife in my cup
If you know one thing about us, that's life is tough
Growing up in the projects made it twice as rough
Talk that stuff, but you can't walk my path
Alot of niggas I ran with, last scene was a blood bath
Little childrens only 3 and they learn to curse
Can't remember his ABC's, but can kick a rap first
That hurts, cause he ain't never partied his life
And with these new laws we got, only get us despite
Cause these niggas I roll with, they gonna make it regardless
And if it ain't that rap shit, it's gonna be 9s and revolvers
Don't nobody wanna get left behind
Two steps in front is better than a step behind 
Pack a nine cause a good job is hard to find
And for the 9-9, all we trying to do is shine
Momma told me to go to school, but I ain't think it was worth it
I was fucking with them hoes and defeating the purpose
Back then it was about fighting, life and weed
Didn't finish the 12th grade, so I'm incomplete
When I rock that wear, I throw an extra clip 
Ain't that a trip, nah nigga life in the bricks

Chrous: [Mr. Marcelo]

No ifs, no ands, no buts, no whys
Represent the Third Ward, 'til the day I die
Cause I only got love for my ghetto
and if you niggas don't know now you know
No ifs, no ands, no buts, no whys
Represent the Third Ward, 'til the day I die
Cause I only got love for my ghetto
and if you niggas don't know now you know
No ifs, no ands, no buts, no whys
Represent the Third Ward, 'til the day I die
Cause I only got love for my ghetto
and if you niggas don't know now you know
No ifs, no ands, no buts, no whys
Represent the Third Ward, 'til the day I die
Cause I only got love for my ghetto
and if you niggas don't know now you know

We brick livin'
We brick livin'</pre>
