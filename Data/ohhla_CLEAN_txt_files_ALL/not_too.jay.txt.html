Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's more than one way to heal a leper
Terrorize the commercialized thrill the hecklers
You might be eating off that wack shit for now
but I interrupt dinner like bill collectors
Hit the lights cue music run the real projectors
I was raised on kool-aid and pac-man
Steely dan gap band michael jackson
Outside the fiends would scuffle up for crack
In the same spots where shell-toes was doin backspins
That's why I spit the otherful colorful you a fly motherfucka
You bubble you b-l-o-w
Visual like the hubble, you trouble,
Lancaster to man-chester
I slam rappers
And keep weak niggas in line like band campers</pre>
