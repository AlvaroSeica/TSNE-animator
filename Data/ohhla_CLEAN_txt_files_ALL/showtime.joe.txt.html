[Chorus: Joe Mafia]
It's showtime with a man, yo, give it up
Live byes with the kid, G, live it up
Ice work, make the shit hurt, glittered up
Either frontline or red shirt, hit 'em up
Watch all, trust none, pop that clip
Clock that chick, nigga, rock that shit
Watch all, trust none, pop that clip
Clock that chick, nigga, rock that shit

[Joe Mafia]
Network, get work, touch bases, connect
Nah why for wreck, Fly Ty on the stretch
Fake cats Moet, bent over on the top
Rapid fire will spit, crash ya click, eject
Your gas line of your met, live or die concept
Prize down the whole set, playing Russian roulette
Staying home with Coulette, put this in the pine wrecks
Watch ya pop wallet, bang 'em all in the head
Where gatter lockers dead, common wealth is fed
We set it off by itself, they don't give a percent
We get locked to dead, run the clock movement
How the box and apocalypse move unit
Time hold your shit, know the DVD pit
And the nicks with chicks, line sticks and licks
With tons of hits on vicks, Maf' spit hotness
Eat legit off this, cop only hot shit

[Chorus]

[Joe Mafia]
For all the minds that's locked up with mad time
Get barred up in the club, and scrape dimes
V.I.P. on the list, and skip line
Middle finger the bouncers, and want times
DT's up on the joint, we part time
Momma look right in Prada and in Kline
Tomorrow right back on the grind, two hot nines
Brand new package to rock on Slot Time
Blow to the dred, for 'dro and brought lah
Set it up in shadows, dumb live and high
At the party, look, puento, five or five
Lobster, Hennessey, Bacardi lime
Bell ringers that got pies and ring times
Hogtie a nigga to swine and front live

[Chorus]

[Joe Mafia]
Did his time, executive produce, it's me
Courtesy Napoleon and Myalansky
Victory aligned, playing no games G
I've been behind the scene and seen all the main G
For biting ass niggas and corny ass MC's
I seen the lies in this, I had to switch up the steeze
Brand new the script, new whips and more cheese
Export works, to twerk, flooding on the speeds
Laundrymat rappers, is on officially
You might as well speedball to get an iller D
With felonies, I sprayed that case to mystery
The co-defendants gotta get missing, it's all plain
It's all cream involved in this, and plus we all team
So if one of us blow trial, we all bleed
One family, reginent NT
Mind get mine on the T-O-P

[Chorus]</pre>
