The Carnival of Carnage, the Ringmaster
The Riddlebox, the Great Milenko
The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, and the Wraith
Looks like we're all out of time brother, everybody's out of time
Fuck it, we gots to tell them, all secrets will now be told
No more hidden messages, this is it y'all, time's up
Everything be out right here, no need for the reverse talking, the truth

Now we have been told this Carnival shit has touched on many lives
People have fuckin' sworn to us they too can feel it inside
What is it that draws you in, this magic that compels you
We've been waiting six fuckin' Joker Cards to finally tell you
The messages and hints were there although most never picked up on 'em
We snuck 'em in subliminally with that wicked shit around them
We mentioned more and more of this on every Joker's Card
The bottom line, always the same, you ain't have to look hard
We wickedly kick it, inflict it, you get it, get with it and dig we don't preach it flat out
Cause some ninjas don't wanna get wit ya, they quick to forget ya without the Hatchet and gat out
So we rose the Hatchet, do or die, now Juggalos standing tall
After all six have risen, the end of time will consume us all
It ain't got nothing to do with us, it ain't Psychopathic Records
All we're doing is pointing shit out to you, we in this together
Who's behind the Dark Carnival, the Gatherings and the Hatchet
Who's behind Dark Lotus, the Circus and everybody at it
Who invented Juggalos and Juggalettes and fuckin' Faygo showers
What about that feeling you get when bumping our shit, who's behind these Juggalo powers
This ain't no fucking fan club, it ain't about making a buck
Don't buy our fuckin' action figures bitch, I don't give a fuck
It ain't about Violent J or Shaggy, the Butterfly or Seventeen
When we speak of Shangri-La, what you think we mean
Truth is we follow God, we've always been behind him
The Carnival is God and may all Juggalos find him

May the Juggalos find him, may the Juggalos find him
May the Juggalos find him, he's out there, he's out there

We're not sorry if we tricked you, we don't care what happens now
We're not sorry if we tricked you, we swing our Hatchets and we're proud
We're not sorry if we tricked you, painted faces in the crowd
We're not sorry if we tricked you, the Carnival will carry on

Yeah, he's out there, may the Juggalos find him
Yeah, he's out there, may the Juggalos find him

We're not sorry if we tricked you, the Carnival will carry on
We're not sorry if we tricked you, the Carnival will carry on
We're not sorry if we tricked you, painted faces in the crowd
We're not sorry if we tricked you, the Carnival will carry on

Yeah, he's everywhere, I'm sayin' he's anywhere
Juggalos, he's out there, yeah, yeah, everywhere, he's out there

Come see the show, big top show
Walk in and hang with the dead carnival
Dead dirty carnies, dead Juggalos
Walk in and hang with the dead carnival, he's out there
Juggler, juggler, fuck with the juggler
Juggler, juggler, fuck with the juggler
Juggler, juggler, fuck with the juggler
You can't fuck with the juggler

May the Juggalos find him
May the Juggalos find him
He's out there, may the Juggalos find him
May the Juggalos find him
He's out there, he's out there

We all gon' die, but I'm not gonna fry
Evern most never try, I'm not gonna let this pass me by, no
This is our world, this is our world
This is our world, so get the fuck out
This is our world, this is our world
This is our world, so get the fuck out

We're not sorry if we tricked you, we don't care what happens now
We're not sorry if we tricked you, we swing our Hatchets and we're proud
We're not sorry if we tricked you, painted faces in the crowd
We're not sorry if we tricked you, the Carnival will carry on

Suck my nuts bitch, fuck you
Suck my nuts bitch, fuck you

Inner City Posse got the dog beats, ICP, we got the dog beats
Inner City Posse got the dog beats, ICP, we got the dog beats
Three rings, a ding a ding ding, people love to point and stare
Three rings, a ding a ding ding, it's the same as everywhere
Murder go round, murder go round, how ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown
Murder go round, murder go round, how ya gonna fuck with a wicked clown

He's out there
We don't care what happens now
We swing our Hatchets and we're proud
Painted faces in the crowd
The carnival will carry on
The carnival will carry on
Painted faces in the crowd
The carnival will carry on
The carnival will carry on
