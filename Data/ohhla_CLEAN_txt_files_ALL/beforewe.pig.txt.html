[Pigeon John]
I spent six months on the road
Watching trees through the window
Singin my songs to packed-in shows
Girls fill the whole front row
But it don't mean a thing... hmm-mmm-mm
The seeds insane on the low
Bathroom stalls packed full of snow
Anything you want is yours on the go
Suicide Girls at the do'
But it don't mean a thing... if you're not here

..If you're not here
But it don't mean a thing... hmm-mmm-mm

I'm in a brand new Cadillac
The engine purrs, the paint spills black
Rollin with homies who don't know how to act
and we all got our seats pushed back
But, it don't mean a thing... if you're not here!

[Chorus]
This ain't another love song
I'm tryna figure out what's right or wrong
Before we're gone (before we're gone) oh-oh
Well let's stand outside of our regret
and share another cigarette
Before we're gone... oh-oh

[Pigeon John]
Uh, it seems the party never end
Hundred dollar tab bills, so-called friends
They promise and smile and laugh and pretend
that they all wanna share this syringe
But, it don't mean a thing... hmm-mmm-mm
I sing this song from inside
Behind the walls, behind all the pride
For fear that I'll never realize
that you are the pride
And it don't mean a thing... if you're not here!

[Chorus]
Hey, this ain't another love song
I'm tryna figure out what's right or wrong
Before we're gone (before we're gone) oh-oh
(Hey) Well let's stand outside of our regret
and share another cigarette
Before we're gone... oh-oh
You go ahead and reapply your Chapstick
Me? I'm gonna take my last sip
Before we're gone... oh-oh
You run ahead and call shotgun
I don't, and then you smile and say I'm not fun
Before we're gone, before we're gone</pre>
