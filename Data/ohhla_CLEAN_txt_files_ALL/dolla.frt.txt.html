[Intro: Mike Shinoda] + (DJ Green Lantern)
Yeah (OHH) like that y'all
(This how it's goin down Mike?)
Uh-huh (well let's kill 'em then)
Woo! Like, that
Fort Minor, S.O.B.
Yeah, like this, listen

[Mike Shinoda]
Attention please, I only need a second
to make a mental impression directly on any record so
Give me space to move, room to prove
I'm stupid with the P's and Q's
Ladies and gentlemen I'm sendin you bendin
Pretendin the pen is a needle, I'm injectin the venom
And I'll be damned if I let another man get to me
I'll bruise you with a shoe to the family jewelry
I'm back with fury, attack quickly
Sick with a BIC pen, all up in your shit man!
You never knew the flow 
was sick as this, bitch listen when I'm lettin you know
Got a grip on these tracks that you wish you got
Got a clique full of assholes, I kid you not
So when that mixtape's done and that album drops
Ryu and Tak and me got it loaded and locked; believe it

[Ryu]
You still breathin? I'm cockin and squeezin
Tucked steel? Nope, I don't give a fuck who.. (believe it)
You still breathin? I'm cockin and.. (believe it)
You still breathin? (believe it, believe it)

You still breathin? I'm cockin and squeezin
Tucked steel? Nope, I don't give a fuck who sees it
Broad day, sittin sideways, stuffed in a small cave
for three fuckin weeks 'til you reek like dog waste
Uh, really, I put a punk in his place
Let's see if he freestyles with a pump in his face
Got somethin to say? Please, better keep it a secret
The streets got hideous ways of handlin beef, bitch
So eat shit, hate it or love it
The underdog's on top, gettin faded tellin people to suck it
Buckin 'em down for real while you fuckin around
I'm stuck in the house for months tryin to sharpen my skills
So how does it feel? You lames wanna claim my throne
You got a better chance gettin Danny Hayes on the phone
Good luck, I flame suckers 'til they're black and crispy
Sneakin heat up in the club like a flask of whiskey, uhh

[Tak]
Yeah, I'm here to crack the roof in
You got a nice watch but your raps are useless
You better cut the crap 'fore I snap some nooses
And leave you all snoozin on some afternoon sheeit
Yeah, I hit the streets with a cake
and batter for fun, just to spit bleach in his face
It's lunchtime punk, open the face
Hit you with a punchline 'til you choke on your teeth
Catch me at a show rockin in that tipsy mode
Like angels and demons unlockin DaVinci's Code
One drop in the canister, people split the globe
Blowin every planet to shit once I hit the road, uhh
You in the tight bitch, cut you with Apathy
I'm on the night shift, see I +Hustle+ like Cassidy
So kill that chit-chat and let the West Coast see
One of the illest names, Ribkat from S.O.B., c'mon

[Outro: DJ Green Lantern]
That's right, Fort Minor, "We Major"
Green Lantern, Mike Shinoda, S.O.B.
Demigodz, Machine Shop, Linkin Park
You already know man, this is an invasion!</pre>
