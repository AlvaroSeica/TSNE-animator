In the City of Angels
Ain't no motherfucking joke
Watch your back ese
That's right
I'll take your feria and your fucking puta
(Gimme that bitch)
That's the way it's going down

Simon, simon ese, yo soy Conejo de la calle veinte cinco
El valla mas chingones, este I aqui (West Coast locos)
In the wicked part of Los (West Coast) 
And if you don't believe me, just ask the enemigos
Â¿Que calle? en el parque ese, looking for some shit
Tryin to kill the homeboys from the Tiny Locos Clique
Spraying on the snitches, cuz that's the way it goes
They rattle up tecote, on everyone they know
And now it's time to ride, and now it's time to die
Nine automatics sitting on my side
So let me just grab a couple extra clips
Blast this vato, then scratch him off my list
When others take revenge, while they make them movida
Shot calling in las calles, they breaking up posida
How you expect to fly when your wings got clipped
How you expect to kill when you hold no steel
Vatos know the real, all the blood gets spilled
Bitches for the thrill, enemigas get the chills
Talking about a place where there is no angle
Choose your poison where there is no angel

In the City of Angels there ain't no angels
Puro vato loco, crazy gang-bangers
In the City of Angels there ain't no angels
Puro vato loco

Damn, another bang bang, killed your homeboy
Now isn't it a shame, that's what my petho said
And one of his jams, all bitches rattle but you didn't understand
So I'm break it down, ese I'ma put it down
Conejo rolled up, now it's looking like a ghost town
Where you at? I thought you had control
Fucking with the hache, loco now you gotsta go misunderstood
Up in Hotel California with two wicked props
Homey burning like infernos on the serio
Ese gotsta get his issue, and walk away like nada
And not even miss you, I don't trip
I'll catch you on the rebound, I'll see you in the barrio
And then we could get down, down and dirty
That's the only way, I automade her body, with digital delay
I waste no time, I get up and I go
Cuz no one really knows what this broad could hold
She could set me up ese, for the right price
Depends on her addiction, the streets ain't nothing nice

In the City of Angels there ain't no angels
Puro vato loco, crazy gang-bangers
In the City of Angels there ain't no angels
Puro vato loco, crazy gang-bangers
In the City of Angels there ain't no angels
Puro vato loco, crazy gang-bangers
In the City of Angels there ain't no angels
Puro vato loco

Puro vato loco, that's right ese
Check it out

First I claim my city, puro Los Angeles
You know holmes, that's where the gangas is
First I claim my city, puro Los Angeles
You know holmes, that's where the gangas is

That's where the gangas at loco

First I claim my city, puro Los Angeles
You know holmes, that's where the gangas is
First I claim my city, puro Los Angeles
You know holmes, that's where the gangas is
