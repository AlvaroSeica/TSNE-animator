[Chorus: Phil Anastasia]
Yeah, doing that shit, my way
Yes, yes, ya'll, ain't no want it
Yeah, doing that shit, we say
Yes, yes, ya'll, we ain't frontin'

[Phil Anastasia]
Bunch of wannabe gangstas, thinking drama is cool
I do what's necessary, momma didn't raise no fool
From Pinocchio school, leaving DNA trails
In your wifey's fallopian tubes, ruin your marriage
You walk around with my baby in your carriage
Comes to rapping, I'm like Afrin, clearing out a passiage
In your nose cavity, get it cracking
Phil Anastasia, alias Cletus Kasady
Carnage, a killa villain down with Victor Von Doom
Still dropping iller shit, until Gorilla Monsoon
Hit you with the boom, gonna sue 'em
These faggot MC's need to give the kid some room
CUz I was getting dusted, tripping on e
Buggin' on shrooms, fucking with goons
It's Looney Tunes and a Disney Afternoon
More style then Vidal Sassoon, pants down
Ape shit, ass hanging out, straight baboon
I catch a break soon, or watch when I get pinched
For starting up a life of being e, like the Grinch
I take a wrench to ya mug, give you a Mona Lisa smile
If the good die young, then I should be here for a while

[Chorus]

[Hook: Phil Anastasia]
A yes yes ya'll, and you don't stop
Mr. Phil Anastasia, coming off top
A yes yes ya'll, and you don't quit
Muthafuckas keep talking that shit
A yes yes ya'll, and you don't stop
Phil Anastasia, streetlife and big Rock
A yes yes ya'll, tear it up in this bitch
Muthafuckas keep talking that shit

[Streetlife]
I came through with the Wu, jumped off Meth back
Hopped off of that, cuz I started making tracks hot
Coming for the number one spot, yeah, why not?
I got respect on the block, and my guns bust
Never had much, so a lost is nothing
We can shoot it back, double or nothing
Nigga, you just good for nothing, I'mma show you
What an MC should be, without the gimmicks
Just straight lyrics, my words is vivid, tear any eye
Catch me on the fly, sky's the limit
Watch me take flight, never tossing my gun
You want Street? I'm in the slums, man, you know where to come
If you want some of this hot shit, my voicebox is toxic
We lock the blocks and pop locks like locksmith
Yo, I got this, Park Hill, we rock this
Phil Anastasia, go cop this

[Hook II: Phil Anastasia (Streetlife) {Rock}]
A yes yes ya'll (you don't stop)
(I pop shots, Streetlife, I make the block hot)
A yes yes ya'll (I might flip)
Muthafuckas keep talking that shit
A yes yes ya'll {Rock, man, god dammit}
{I'm the best ya'll, I been said it, ya'll}
A yes yes ya'll {Don't test, I got it on my hip}
Muthafuckas keep talking that shit {Come on}

[Rock]
Listen, if good mean bad ---- I'm terrible
Unbarable, here with a few grizzly bears, handsomeble
We inparable, shit these fuckas can do it
You history class, out to get cut, I'm the truest
You bout to have me hopping out a few drips
Clean, smooth, quick, punch out your toothes
I'm old school wit it, yet I'm so brand new wit it
Eat your food from the real to ya toe food, niggas
This ain't real, beef? Have your whole crew snitch
A first nigga move, I'mma do him like his coach do, bench you
His old crew'll miss him, but the four-four won't though
It'll hit you somewhere, skull leg, gut torso
Might hit you on your hand, but a finger coming off though
I show you grocery, without no bonus though, homey
I'm off the man, Rocko, a Mag Force Gang
Boot Camp, that mean I got soldiers and gats going bang

[Hook] + [Hook II]
