[Chorus] [Greg Nice]
This shit is so damn hot hot, this shit is hot hot hot

[Verse One] [Juju]
Big Ju, nigga
The host with the mostest
Find a nigga up with the dough, where the toast is 
Hoes say I keep it up like posters
Slap the first nigga that plays me the closest
Still drunk, still grabbing chochas
Dark and sneaky like the rats and the roaches
Careful in the way you cats approach us
Cause playa, you more out of shape than the coach is
Junkyard nigga, collect yourself
You're letting that persona effect yourself
That's not enough armor to protect yourself
If we catch you, coming through the projects for delf 
So be smart duke and spread the wealth
We got cannons looking for a head to melt
Hit you with eight shots 'fore the first one's felt
That's how we do it around here situation dealt. 

[Bridge]
It's the Indiana Jones
Funky stone city cabrones
Names ring like cellular phones
Look back, fall back, catch a heart attack
Cause there ain't nothing in the world, the Nuts will ever lack
This shit is hot!

[Chorus] [Greg Nice]
This shit is so damn hot hot, this shit is hot hot hot

[Verse Two] [Psycho Les]
I ain't got time to be playin' games with the same jokers
This grind don't stop, baby I stay focused
You're whole gangsta is bogus
Your the type to draw a weapon, just to draw attention
I pull your heart out, and leave you with your chest flaming
With no special effects by Wes Craven
This Psych Les reigning
Tech and the mack spraying
DUCK! 
Before you be on your back layin'
Nomsaying? 
You asked for war
I'ma take my gloves off and smack your jaw
I just got back from tour, niggas running their mouth
Like they're gorillas, till the guns in their mouth
Now their not killas 
They not mad at me
Now they just screaming, "Don't kill me, I have a family!" 
It's big Psych I push it down like gravity
And bring the pain to your brain like a cavity

[Bridge]
It's the Indiana Jones
Funky stone city cabrones
Names ring like cellular phones
Look back, fall back, catch a heart attack
Cause there ain't nothing in the world, the Nuts will ever lack
This shit is hot!

[Chorus] [Greg Nice]
This shit is so damn hot hot, this shit is hot hot hot

[Psycho Les]
Beatnuts rock on, rock on. Greg n-a n-a n-a rock on, rock on. (X4)</pre>
