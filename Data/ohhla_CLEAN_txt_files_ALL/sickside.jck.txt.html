[Verse 1. Sick Jacken]
Let me tell you about my hood, let me tell you about my block 
So many hoodlums, so many cops 
Two ways out, get paid or in a box 
One way to win, do what you can and shake the spot 
Slugs, pills, a lot of drug deals and thugs killed 
It's all for money and the power cause the buck's real 
And if you're scared homie you can cop a church, kneel 
Pray to God, see if he even gives a fuck still 
There's no religion, just these concrete saints 
That only kneel when the sharpness shanks 
In the street and in the holding tanks 
In the west by the ? banks 
Where in war does your army rank? 
Soldier, I seen this shit young 
That's my poison tongue 
Only spits about my boys with guns 
Fire got you shook, you only hear the noise and run 
And that fear makes extortion fun 
You ain't the one

[Chorus]
If all hoods are the same, let me tell you about mine 
All these young kids doing street level crime 
Some on the run and some doing time 
We gotta turn these kids to a sickside mind

Cali is sick, New York is sick 
Chi-town sick, the whole block sick 
When you're out on the street doing dirt with your clique 
Just remember the legit gets the law of the dick

[Verse 2. B Real]
Now I don't want to be stuck with this bad luck shit 
All you mushed out bitches I can't fuck with 
This whole subject is painful, I love it 
We share the stories not meant for the public 
We struggle to get here, next year new story 
Taking over, wait's over, best feel the change over 
What it took to prosper, no apologies to offer 
Got the best you can put on a roster 
Psycho sick, assassins sick 
Every now and then we need a revolution 
So we spray the hallways 
You're in a haze when the song plays 
And you don't want to come at us the wrong way 
It's only for some, this crazy ass city we run 
It's in our blood, we live and die by the gun 
Wipe your tears or the blood right in front of your eyes 
This city is cold and she don't cry when you die

[Chorus]
If all hoods are the same, let me tell you about mine 
All these young kids doing street level crime 
Some on the run and some doing time 
We gotta turn these kids to a sickside mind

LA is sick, New Jersey is sick  
Beantown sick, the whole block sick 
When you're out on the street doing dirt with your clique 
Just remember the legit gets the law of the dick

[Verse 3. Sick Jacken]
I'm from a crooked angle, eh homie make my dust angel 
This city block got me locked in a tight strangle 
Graffiti bombs, see these walls by the knife angle 
At least too raw, milli wars and the stars spangled 
That's what the ? is for, exercise the art of war 
In the hood but not in yours, that's when the shotties rock 
Watch where you're at man, the streets in a constant spar 
Don't try to be a hero, that's what the cops are for 
The lifestyle we lead is money, whiskey, and weed 
And gun battles make it risky indeed 
No money, more problems got my city in need 
It's CA all day where we hustle and bleed 
Scrape the Cali concrete for dope 
Stay hungry in the street cause this music shit's about to blow 
Trying to stay out of the county so I dodge the law 
And these enemies that plot my fall, fuck em all

[Chorus]
If all hoods are the same, let me tell you about mine 
All these young kids doing street level crime 
Some on the run and some doing time 
We gotta turn these kids to a sickside mind

Atlanta is sick, Philly stay sick 
Texas sick, the whole block sick 
When you're out on the street doing dirt with your clique 
Just remember the legit gets the law of the dick</pre>
