(*Plane on final approach over Los Angles Airport*)

(*Plane Landing sound and the L.A.D.P. Sirens Samples started*)

(*Sample of Press Printing Machines*)

GIVE ME MY PURSE!!
GIVE ME BACK MY PURSE!!

[Eazy-E]
Awww shit, man
Black bitches, black gangsters are at it again

[Dr. Dre]
You are now about to witness, the Strength of Street Knowledge

[Lay Law as a Narrator]
Straight off the streets of Compton, dedicated and by most suckers hated
Would you put your hands together for.. Eazy-E and N.W.A.?  (*Echoes*)

(*Explosion*)

[DJ Yella]
N.W.A.'s Straight Outta Compton Video banned by M.T.V.
N.W.A.'s music banned by most black Radio Stations
N.W.A. is criticized, and for what? - Telling it like it is

[Dr. Dre]
Yo, we ain't selling out
Fuck crossing over to them, let them cross over to us

[Ice Cube]
Fuck them!!
Long as motherfuckers still buying it, the Media ain't shit (*Echoes*)

[Eazy-E]
Fuck everybody, let's do it
YO DRE, KICK IN THE BASS!!
