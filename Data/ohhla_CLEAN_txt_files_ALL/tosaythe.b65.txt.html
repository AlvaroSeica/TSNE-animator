[A man's voice]
More often a novel
What's word's owning is worth fighting for
whether it be life, love or the pursuit of happiness
mom's apple-pie
or even something as basic as sex
and don't go knocking it
that three-letter-word makes a mockery
of the four-letter-onces that tries to cheaping it
It's a wonderful game for people of all ages
and even for losers it's worth a try
That's good morning and good bye

[Buck 65]
They sit in your section
they think you gentle and nice
you bring glasses of water
with lentils and rice
Old-fashioned outfits
That also appears
their ? are greater
when you don't wear brasires
They give you their orders
and watch when you write them
wishing that you
could be dammed and you aight them
They wanna be breast-fed
the day you get work off
if you in their thoughts
they walk home and then jerk off
You look like a model
so young and attractive
the regular customers
the old and the crappy
The food is here rotten
but the service is stellar
I know that I love her
and I wish I could tell her
But they don't know your name
cause you don't really care
as long as they tip you
and stay in their chair
They swallow their tongues
in a venom, dirty wipers
if you tell them a lie
and changes the dirty diapers</pre>
