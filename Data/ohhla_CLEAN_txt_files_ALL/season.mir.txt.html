(Its huntin' season) - 2X

{*repeat in background during hook*}
My lungs aint weezin' 
My heart aint seazin' 

[Hook]
We bout to lay em down cause its huntin' season 
We bout to lay these haters down 
We bout to lay these bitches down  (cause its huntin' season) 
We bout to lay these haters down 
We bout to lay these bitches down (cause its huntin' season) 

[Verse 1]
I off this shit and fuckin' wonder if I die early 
I got my blessings every day that I was able to be 
Now sit in jail or well should I say in the pits of hell 
Stuck up in the stank cell with no motherfuckin' bail 
I done been there before 
I aint goin back no fuckin more 
Sleepin on them cold floors 
Teach these niggas 
Fuck this ho 
Say they can kiss my asshole 
Suck my big pinky toe 
Somebody gotta let them know 
Niggas aint takin this shit no more 
Say how is it they can drag us around 
Sticks up in our ass 
You done forty-one times 
Hit my head then sag 
Quick to point the fuckin finger 
Quick to set every nigga 
Yall aint bang drank liquor 
How the fuck do they figure 
When they bang fuckin triggers 
Jealous guns I did nigga 
Man pistol swore niggas 
Every glock and six figures 
Judge when you look he in his eye 
Not because you think he high 
It aint right to take a life 
Just because a man aint white 
How is it they can kill us and then motherfuckin walk 
Get suspended with pay 
Lie and say it aint so 
Set that fed bullshit 
We gonna see who get dick 
Label me a lunatic 
Fuck that injustice shit 

[Hook] - 3X

[Verse 2]
Its lame aint it cuz 
Matter fact its fucked up 
There aint no fuckin war on drugs 
Its to light our ass up 
If I'm guilty then I'm guilty 
If I'm not then I'm not 
In the end it only matters what loyal that I got 
I aint gonna do the damn crime 
If i can't pay the damn fine 
Let you point your damn hand 
Have you lost your fuckin mind 
I aint mad at you for it 
I'm just tryin to let you know 
When they close that cell door 
There aint no son let me go 
I'm gonna tell you what I know 
Not some shit I fuckin wrote 
You gonna do the damn time 
Rain sleet fuckin snow 
So ride with no dope 
If you black thats a no 
Get somebody thats white cause they wont get pulled over 
How much can a man take?? 
Before his soul fuckin break 
And he think bein born is his worst fuckin mistake 
Stick to milds cause he brown 
Never smile always frown 
Keep his head down low 
Don't know where he wanna go 
So he turned to the blow 
Now thats all that he know 
Tell me whats his breakin point 
Every time he let go 
Should I fear for my life 
When I go out at night 
Why they take away my rights 
Give me no money to fight 
Am I that damn right 
Am I high as a kite 
I aint puffin at the mouth 
Yall know I'm fuckin right 
Now how is thay can kill us and motherfuckin walk 
Get suspended with pay 
And lie and say it aint so 
Set that fed bullshit 
We gonna see who get dick 
Label me a lunatic 
Fuck that injustice shit 

[Hook] - 4X
