{*vocalizing*}
Yeah
Hop in my low low, baby, ride with me (Ride with me)
We on the west coast, ride with me (Ride with me, ride)
Hop in my low low, baby, ride with me (Baby, ride with me)
We on the west coast, ride with me (Ride with me)

[Verse 1: Frost (Vocal Bizz)]
I'm in my low low, cruisin' slow mo with the top down (Top down)
But I ain't solo with this mami with her top down (Top, girl)
Do you wanna come and play
And you don't gotta worry what your boyfriend say (Boyfriend say)
You know we ain't comin' home tonight (We ain't coming home tonight)
And we gon' do this baby til the morning light
And I know
That you can freak me, baby, like nobody else that I know
That I ain't felt the same way that I'm feeling, baby (Nobody else that I know)
Let's go

Chorus: Vocal Bizz
Hop in my low low, come and ride with me
Up to the low low, come inside with me
Ride
Ride, come on, ride with me tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Hop in my low low, baby, ride with me
Up to the mo-mo, come inside with me
Ride
Ride, come on, ride with me tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

[Verse 2: Mr. Sancho {Vocal Bizz}]
You lookin' sexy (Sexy)
With the devil big brown eyes
You lookin' sexy (Sexy)
Let me get inbetween them tights, thighs
We dippin' in the low low {Low low}
Drop the top with the switch runnin', come on, let's go {Let's go}
We get in to the mo-mo
Get you hot enough to make you take off your clothes {Take, off, your, clothes}
Baby, let me give you what you need
For the tension with a whole lot of ecstacy
And I'm tipsy off the Hennessey
Cause I need from the vision of you next to me {Oh}

[Vocal Bizz]
You can come and hang
You can be my baby (You can be my baby)
You can be my lady, cause you only my play thing (Yeah)

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
[Frost] Hey little mama, won't you roll with me
        Sippin' on some Cristal in that Hennessey
        This is how I do it if you down with me
        We can do it all night on that ecstacy
[Bizz]  Come on, let's ride, babe (Ride, babe)
        You dancing at my whip
        You make me high, babe (You make me high, babe)
        In case your juicy lips in
        Inhale, exhale with my flow (With my flow)
        I'm smitten at you hoverin', girl, let's go (Let's go)

Repeat Chorus

[Vocal Bizz]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Oooh, baby, won't you ride tonight, yeah
Baby, won't you ride with me tonight</pre>
