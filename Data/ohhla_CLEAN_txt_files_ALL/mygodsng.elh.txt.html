Ohhh lawwwdd! Father don't let him bury me...

[Eligh]
Now could it be, that I've been saved?
And learned to pray, at a young age, when I was afraid
Burning sage, turn the page
From the cradle to the grave - you come first
On this planet called Earth I'm a slave to your pathways
Even when I fall {?} women that sashay
of light that you cascade (oh God)
My soul cavity defying gravity my lying had to be ended
Pretending I was invincible
Pushing death from the back of the neck with no principles
Trace of fear, when you're near
I used to mock all my friends
when they would pray before they ate, but now it's clear
I still make mistakes as I'm still just a man
But appeal for your grace with my heels in the sand
Cause I feel when you're present or don't, not adolescent I cope
Your sunlight gives the ultimate tan
And I'm just a fan - in between the lines
Make amends with friends daily and make time
to meditate, set it straight, but wait
I got a date, to levitate, and heyyyyy

{I can't see anyone but you...}
{My love, must be a kind of blind love}
{I can't see anyone but you} "My, my, my God"
Meditate, set it straight, but wait
I got a date, to levitate, and heyyyyy
meditate, set it straight, but wait
I got a date, to levitate, and heyyyyy
{I can't see anyone but you} "My God"

As I walk through the desert with a canteen full of dreams
Fantasy encounters we are right-brained
Man of hope, found a way to cope, without the dope
That in itself a miracle of God
Some people have, a problem with the word
Religion doesn't play a part of what I serve
So many names; some people call him Jesus, Buddha, Allah
but I came to say - to get your own
It doesn't matter what you label it or paraphrase it it's the code
to dial up, when I fowl up in front of crowds of
loud with a towel up, throw the white flag in
Tap out, in the end I'm surrendering will
Don't wanna die, don't wanna stress
my heart to the brink of destruction I guess
Meditate breathe in your blessings and test
my inner eye, identify, your quest
Exemplify, through the men of peace, at least
I try to be the best that I can be and help another find the key
to lock to help me finalize the flight I meditate
to set it straight, but wait
I got a date, to levitate my fate
and meditate, set it straight, but wait
I got a date to levitate my fate
{But you} "Reminisce, reminisce over you my God"

{My love must be a kind of blind love}
{I can't see anyone but you}
{I only have eyes, for, you...}
