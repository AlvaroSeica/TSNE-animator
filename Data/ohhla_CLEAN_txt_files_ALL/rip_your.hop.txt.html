[Intro]
Well, now that you've all prepared yourselves for the madness
I present to you... Hopsin and Tech N9ne!

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
See I be bangin on niggas with rapping voodoo, no slack for you fools
If you ain't getting the message I'll slap it through you
My ass is coo coo, cracks is brutal, that's the usual
Shit that we do in Panorama City
No time for no bitches acting to sadity
My niggas is rugged really they kinda gritty, for really
Explosive, you know this, come get your daily dosage
I spit that funky shit, can you send a medic for my halitosis?
The flow is as solid as diamonds
Niggas should know they cannot corrode this
So motherfucker bow down as if you're tryin to suck on your own dick
(Ferocious)
Keep Nicki tight and then watch my ass stretch
You'll feel the wrath if ever you fags test
You're just a sperm cell that climbed up out of your dads rectum
Motherfucker I got balls like I'm Ash Ketchum
I really can't imagine not spazzing on a track this savage
I snap then I'm a little fanatic
So orgasm cause they witnessin madness nigga
This that twenty one three classic nigga
Talking that shit get yo ass whooped nigga
Damn it that nigga Hopsin he be killing shit
If I see him I'mma blast that nigga

[Chorus: 2x]
We the coldest, Flow Hypnosis
So explosive, Yo bitch knows it

[Bridge]
You damn right
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
Day and night
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
You damn right
Nigga I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
Day and night
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Loaded with the bomb I got, if you step to me
Gonna be the one inside my trajectory
Nigga better run and hide, I kill excessively
That's my recipe, till the death of me
You don't wanna be the reason I'mma lose it
Anybody wanna bite, ya better cool it
Imma chop a top when I come cruisin', Too bit
Slightly chop and I can prove it, stupid
Imma break 'em all down, Tecca Nina sick and censor all clowns
Egar to F it up, Leaving the area
Evil I eat 'em up, Fuckin' yall sounds
Smother ya, when I pop at people they discover the
Killer stoppin' evil, what the fuck is ya
Trippin off of get to lickin' my governor
Nigga, they callin' me Bane like Saddam Hussein
Ain't that a bitch, cause me and Hop only thing
Is taking the world like Pinky and The Brain
Imma give you the gun and you'll never leave here when the trigger is summoned
I see you sucka shakin, shiverin, running
"The niggas are coming, the niggas are coming!"
Better tell them all that they don't the Nina hell to fall
Ya low life, soon your gonna be no life, doom
Gonna go night, dune, gonna pick yo right tomb
I know it's irking you niggas you watching me rip and then I blow like boom!

[Chorus: 2x]

[Brigde]

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
Let me get the baton back, I'mma bomb rap
Lookin oh so malicious with contacts
Nigga staring like "Damn where yo mind at?"
This ain't no pro level shit, it's beyond that
Loaded up and I'm ready for combat
Standing out like I'm Khalifa's blonde patch
When I come at you, I'm vicious artillery
You wouldn't want it, like Tamika's contract
I K.O. niggas, I'm sorry
Finna throw them in a white trash RV
Finna wake up with a blade stuck in a rib, yelling:
"Oh my goodness yo where are we?
Hopsin this shit is too gnarly!
Why would you wanna go harm me?
I thought we was homies
Now you wanna go and turn me into shrimp on the barbie!"
(Fatality) Bitches I am rap, every verse is fire
I lay my shit down like fertilizer
A murderous words supplier, merking you is my first desire
If you got a problem with me you can suck on my dick 'til it squirts saliva
The whole planet been waiting to get a serial killer symphony
Comin' from the Volume and Strange
Get in the way of a killer, try to deliver
You gonna end up in a trap, bullets all in your brains
MC's wanna take the bar down
I fucked the game and won't even pick your card out
Bitch I'm far out, Hopsin and Tecca Nina taking over
We gon' rip your heart out

[Chorus: 2x]
