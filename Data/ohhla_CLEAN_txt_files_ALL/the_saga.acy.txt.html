[Aceyalone-Talking]
Yeah! One-two..one-two
Where you at? Where you going to?
Is you going do about it? Is you going be about it?
Project Blowed! Abstract, Fat Jack, Ace-One
Ladies and gentleman, good people
Yeah, good brothers and sisters on deck
Yeah, check me out

[Aceyalone]
Dig this, peep the twist
Hand over fist, hand stand on a cliff
Land stiff expand on the gift
Uplift the masses and pass, we the splif
It's love thang, it's a hate thang[Love], it's a great thang [And hate]
Cali to the state of Maine, it's a world thang
And I'ma soldier, always a war going on it's never over [We going have war!]
I make music, for the people, and try to live a good life and keep it peaceful
And be resourceful and keep achieving every season we represent the reason
I'm from the Fellowship, I'm from the Project, I tell them all access is the object
It's so beautiful, it's so painful, I do the work and don't forget what I came for

[Abstract Rude-Chorus]{Aceyalone}
The saga, continues {Yeah!}
On the road again, the different venues {One-two!}
Who blessed you, was kept true {One-two!}
?, cause we got that soul {Where you at?}
The lonely, the only, {Where you going to?}
MC's of the Project Blowed {What chu going do about?}
{Is you going be about it?} MC's of the Project Blowed...{Project Blow!}

[Abstract Rude]
I'm scorpion and don't speak with fortune
I'm your son of light force and dworfins
From the diaphram abdomen and rude
With Ace the voice box, top choice rockers

[Aceyalone]
Aceyalone's my name and Abstract is here

[Aceyalone and Abstract Rude]
He's Fat Jack it's like that and that's the way it is!

[Abstract Rude]
From old school[Old school] to new school [New school] ?
So get used to
Cause I ain't new to the block don't be coppin attitude
You can't have everyone glad, some are going be mad at you
The gossip is heard the Mercury is arising
A profit is earned ghetto enterprising
A moment of truth is hidden in silence
A couplrits crew and nobody smilin
My rubber is going burn more knowledge on the road
That's when you going learn more knowledge on the home

[Abstract Rude-Chorus]{Aceyalone}
The saga, continues {Yeah!}
On the road again, the different venues {One-two!}
Who blessed you, was kept true {One-two!}
?, cause we got that soul{Where you at?}
The lonely, the only, {Where you going to?}
MC's of the Project Blowed {What chu going do about?}
{Is you going be about it?} MC's of the Project Blowed... {Project Blowed!}

[Aceyalone]
Like I was once told something by a wise dude
Keep your eyes on the price by you
So when you slide through you gotta meaning
So here's something you could ride to the scene and
Indepentent, rap label, round table, square business
I got a passport and a Visa, an American dream I want a piece of
I'm a MC, I'm a poet, I do smoking ?, I like smoking Herb
In all of the day, and all in the night, we all in the fight
So don't be trippin on me

[Abstract Rude-Chorus]{Aceyalone}
The saga, continues {Yeah!}
On the road again, the different venues {One-two!}
Who blessed you, was kept true {One-two!}
?, cause we got that soul {Where you at?}
The lonely, the only, {Where you going to?}
MC's of the Project Blowed {What chu going do about?}
{Is you going be about it?} MC's of the Project Blowed...

[YO!] [*Echoes*]

[Abstract Rude]
Everything in me is a ?
The new and improve, the smooth and rough
The rude and nice, don't ruin your life, with a hooligan type
Checkin my Yin and Yang mood
I'm feeling your pain child
My soul sings the songs of James Brown
No jigga boom ? show rather classic and a inventive flow
That'll enlight and wake up to take note
Is it right to have faith and keep hope?
That each quote bless you, finish you
It's kept true, music is my sweet nepwhew

[Abstract Rude-Chorus]
The saga, continues
On the road again, the different venues
Who blessed you, was kept true
?, cause we got that soul [Yo]
The lonely, the only
MC's of the Project Blowed
MC's of the Project Blowed...</pre>
