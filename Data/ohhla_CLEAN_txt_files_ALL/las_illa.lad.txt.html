[Intro: La the Darkman]
Uh huh, yeah, LAD, yeah, uh huh, yo

[La the Darkman]
La get iller than a drunk driver driving a sixteen wheeler
With that 4-5 Colt, I'm a bonafide killer
For breakfast it's grapefruit, counting out of state loot
In the streets, you can ctach me in that seven gray coup
With that ac blowing and that hennessey flowing
Haze got me higher than a Seven Forty Seven Boeing
Cus the world don't love you, they just wanna drug you
Bitches wanna bug you, and niggas wanna mug you
Feds wanna plug you, knowing they wrong
Best hustkers don't get caught, they get snitched on
Niggas like toilet bowels, they full of shit
Then they run to the cops after that fo fo spit
While all I do is this, pluck em and duck em, stick em, I stuck em
All pussy niggas, find them and fuck them
And believe me holmes, you can't hide for long
Cus I let the fifth burn, like Usher's song
Put a bullet through your ass like a bitch through a thong
These monkeys in the jungle and I'm King Kong
La the Dark, Lionheart, I'm Maxwell Smart
Silver Fish Lane Range with the automatic start
AR-15s tear off your body parts
Keep the animals around me like Noah's Ark
Any wolves and pitbulls, gorillas and more
Like America in your country, ready to go to war
Embassy Entertainment, Know we keep that stainless
Front, I'ma stick a boom stick through your anus </pre>
