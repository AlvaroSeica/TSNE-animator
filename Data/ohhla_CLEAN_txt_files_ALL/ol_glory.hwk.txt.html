[Intro: Kryme Life]
Ayo Gooch good lookin baby, Word up
This is T.M.F. man, Straight up Halloween darkness
Kryme Life, No Smiles, Trife Da God

[Kryme Life]
What the deal is, One of the realest on the front line
I know these crab cake niggas wanna bump Kryme
What, We can bang make any time crunch time
Pull out and dump mine, You light in the ass
Keep frontin I'ma light up your Ave
Nigga took off runnin must of thought he was flash
Throw a thunder bolt, Injured his calve
Now his teammates surrenderin fast
In the booth my adrenaline blasts
I'ma cremate niggas to ash, Get my feast on
Clean plates, Beast on, Beat breaks, Beef cakes
Slabs of twenties but we keep shakes
For them fiends with short money and them cheap skates
And steady fuckin up my route, Weight heavy
Hustle up my clout, Do you dirty like a nigga from the South
You talk a lot hope your gun bigger then your mouth
Special delivery send fifty niggas to your house

[Chorus 2X: Kryme Life, (Tommy Whispers)]
Believe me when it's on I'ma smash the mic
(It's top dogs in here) So come flash your stripes
(New York) Staten Island gonna bring it back right
Niggas can talk but they aint half as nice

[Kryme Life]
I'm tellin you now it aint enough room, I'ma touch soon
And I aint been the same ever since we lost Spoon
That time I found myself sittin in the dark room
Turn up the beat, Start throwin harpoons
This is real life, Yeah not a cartoon
You only get one try there aint no part two
My family, My music, I dedicate my heart to
The struggle, The hustle reflected in my art
It's the grief and the streets that made me colder
But the thirst to achieve just made me a soldier
Ride with ambition, Dead niggas with live ammunition
Bless listeners with lines in my scriptures
Get my inspiration from tuff luck
Hard times and I'm still shinnin
Cause under all the pressure is a diamond
It's on I'ma smash the mic, (T.M.F. man, We here man)
Yeah straight off the balcony

[Chorus]

[Kryme Life]
Yeah I'm showin no mercy in verse three
Shit fly, Kids die over turf beef
In the game get fame off controversy
Spit flame, Live my name out on a journey
I'm here to stay for a while I aint leavin early
If I stick to my grind I'ma eat for surely
When we run up in the studio it's with fury
Jack a nigga for his be fast like jewelry
The pitch, The flow, Sick with it they can't cure me
The gift, The glow, And the message is sent purely
How long these rich niggas think they can ignore me
I'm anticipated in the street look for me
Want my fam situated, Fuck livin poorly
Just a nigga tryna make it that's my story
No pain no gain, No guts no glory, We goin in on niggas

[Chorus]</pre>
