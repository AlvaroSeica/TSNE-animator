{Well you tell that worthless pathetic deadbeat motherfucker}

[Heroine]
From caller ID, you with Tru shit
No surprise (so?) Gimme the lies

You got abducted on some X-Files shit from up above
Whatever the fuck, I ain't callin your job, nope, no way
(I guess you know it all) Yo listen, I don't know nothin
Except I'm gettin sick and tired of helpin y'all niggaz frontin
