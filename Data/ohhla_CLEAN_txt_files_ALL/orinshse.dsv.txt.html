Jimmy made a record, pigeonholed, Orin I...
I felt like was sitting on
top of the planet, hanging out at Orin's house
Finishing a song, sitting on Orin's couch
Listening to Orin's footsteps upstairs
Where he went, five ago to break the camcorder out
Back then being humble was something I seldom was
I was 20 then, maybe 21
We just recorded the vocals for the chorus
for "A Wonderful World," so white boy soulful
Hehe, I felt like Marvin Gaye in a skull cap
But sounded like Nick Lachey singin dull and flat
The vocals were a demo for a singer
with a voice much iller than the one you're now listening to
Stepped out the booth with a giggle like that shit's jokes
Orin looked at me and said, "That shit's dope"
Wait - that's when my ego went balloon pop
I danced around the studio doin the moonwalk
If you know "The Opus," imagine how ridiculous I look
Breakdancing to a song about... death
Hehe, I got caught up in the moment
Missed and forgotten, lost in my own head
I started adding up the royalties from record plays
Probably a couple million we could generate
Guarantee I'll pocket one in a couple months
Then be a multi-millionaire by 28
Orin said, "Derek let me get this shit on tape"
He ran upstairs while I stayed sitting on
top of the planet, hanging out at Orin's house
Finishing a song, sitting on Orin's couch
Listening to Orin's footsteps upstairs
Where he went, five ago to break the camcorder out
He pressed record, I stared in the camera lens
"Dead Serious," Das EFX
I repeated every word verbatim, the payment calculation
The millionaire prediction, my hit single sendin me
to sold out stadiums, on stage in front of pyro
Thirty thousand crying, screaming words that I wrote
It was all so vivid in my mind
So real I could hear the crowd singing on my drove home
"And the Juno goes to..." I could hear it now
I can't wait to get the single out</pre>
