[Chino XL]
I know why you're mad at me
Cause I'm everything you wanted to be
It's terrible and sorry to see
Now you hate me cause I'm free
That's how I know
You're no damn good for me

(Fuckin liar - rot in hell!)
(I fuckin hate you - you never deserved me)
(You don't matter - you piece of shit!)
(You cheating whore - no good for me!)

Now every time I see you these days
You're in a get-a-rich-man craze
It seems to be a 30-year phase
I'd love to spit right in your face
That's how I know
You're no damn good for me

(Stop callin - fuckin groupie!)
(I'm laughin at you - I hope you die!)
(I'm doin great - ask your sister)
(Lose my number - no good for me!)

You told me that I'd never make it
Your momma said I'd never be shit
Now I'm tourin all over the world
Your friends laughin at you and you're pissed
That's how I know
You're no damn good for me

(You never loved me - I don't want you!)
(It wasn't worth it - you're disgusting)
(Fuckin idiot - I should've slapped you)
(I wish we never met - die!)

I feel bad for my best friend
Now he's goin through the same things
Sleepin on the couch, sucks to be him
Look at that bitch and say
That's how I know
You're no damn good for me {*echoes*}</pre>
