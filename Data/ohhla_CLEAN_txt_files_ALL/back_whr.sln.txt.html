Typed by: Matt Jost

[ VERSE 1: Piff ]
I feel like I made it, tell me my happy belated
She been gone since '05 but I'm still her favorite
Faded, got that plan mapped out, I ain't perfect yet
But I'm numb to it, dumb off that Percocet
Work got stressful, I don't let that bullshit bug me
They screamin fuck me, but they clowns - no Krusty
( ? ) these rappers flash Piff fans
The best there ever will be - Hitman
H(e)art got a kick stand, I'ma hold you up
When you fall in South Boston, raised a soldier, uh
I stay fly but there's days I be broke as fuck
Cigarette smoke, feelin fuckin hopeless but
I never quit, I promise, I swear to God
This everything I ever wanted, long as I'm alive
I'ma concentrate, hope y'all relate, sponsored by the hate
But broads say you bye, Boston broken hearts
Slaine talk to 'em

[ CHORUS ]
Things'll never be the same again I was told once
And I don't like the new songs as much as the old ones
I'm back to the place where I'm from
I can still remember back to the days I was young

[ VERSE 2: Singapore Kane ]
I'm just tryina get what I deserve
But a life is what you bargained for, I got the nerve
To wanna be livin good, got a call from the bottom up
I'm tryina be the lucky squirrel that got a nut
Been on tour, got bent, traveled and I got stacks
Spent the money on work and bills when I got back
My chick left, she didn't believe, she thought I'd lose
I didn't sing the blues, now I got somethin to prove
If I got to shovel shit I'm gonna get mines
And I'ma get dimes whether or not I spit rhymes
Cops harassin cause I'm in all black
Lookin like an assassin and I'm just puffin grass
My dream is for my seed to never be on that street shit
Or havin that beef shit or caught by police shit
I never sleep with the wife of cats that I eat with
And speakin of cats, I got stripes like Heathcliff

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Slaine ]
I'm back home from tour today, back to my life at home
Worldwide for months spittin raps in a microphone
Livin on the road, bags packed with my wife at home
But she couldn't take it no more, now my wife is gone
They said I'd never make it, disagreed with 'em
All that that I threw them was really only feedin 'em
He had a hunger and a passion, yeah he had a need in him
Jimmy sweatin Nuvoryn, auntie just OD'ed again
But I said that I would make it, yeah I made a good call
You were hatin on the side prayin that I would fall
Moms knew it was in me since I stood a foot tall
Had a heart and I would brawl since I could crawl
I just wanna grow to see my son playin football
I just wanna lay my head in a place I could call
Home, I'm back to the place where I'm from
I can still remember back to those days I was young

[ CHORUS ]
