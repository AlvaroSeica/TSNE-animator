Typed by: AZ Lyrics

She's the only one I care about
My baby really knocks me out
We're as happy as can be
She really got a hold on me
Ms. Jane I just wanna tell you that I love you
I love you so high never put no one above you
Something about the things that you do to me
I'm a break you down into little pieces
Hm ya, You such a knock out, Sky is the limit and I ride clouds
Say you got the fire can I try it now
Looking up at the heavens but I'm high as hell
Roll another one, might as well
It ain't nothing but a word in I Excel?
Ya you got me on another level never hard to find I'm connected like a lego
Every time we ride got to role up all the windows till it's smoky as a train
I can barley see a thing man
Don't wanna be with out her every single night I can't sleep without her cause
She's the only one I care about
My baby really knocks me out
We're as happy as can be
She's really got a hold on me
Ms. Jane I just wanna tell you that I love you
I love you so high never put no one above you
Something about the things that you do to me
I'm a break you down into little pieces
We have such a great time
Birthday 4/20 we the same sign
Smile when I look into your green eyes
Split a swisher down b line
You got my mind in a daze and we party hard like it's the end of our days amen
Any higher I'm a take a trip to heaven
She's my medic relieve my head ache
Oh oh dr. jane but I call her ms.
Only need 30 min and I'm already missin her
Woo don't wanna be without her cause
She's the only one I care about
My baby really knocks me out
We're as happy as can be
She really got hold of me
Ms. Jane I just wanna tell you that I love you
I love you so high never put no one above you
Something about the things that you do to me
I'm a break you down into little pieces
Ya
Roll up
Woo</pre>
