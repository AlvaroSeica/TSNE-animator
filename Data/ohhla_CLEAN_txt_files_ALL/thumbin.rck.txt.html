Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You know I had to fuck with my niggas, shit
Don't turn em up, this all I do, nigga
Touch money and touch bitches
Talk shit and swallow, spit

Huh, she is in low my hustle, the Lamborghini the Rory
I put TVs in the back say good drink ass in the Tarry, play with it
I'm blowing loud, smoking out the rap back
Tony Montana real estate, go check my lap back
I'm a back to back like we riding through Baghdad
Got a job and go play that bitch nigga back, back
I let her on the pole, I let her ride
I let her see some cake, I know I'm out of sight
Thumbin thru the check, thumbin thru the check
Three hundred on my wrist, swear to God I won't confess
Thumbin thru the check, thumbin thru the check
Three hundred on my wrist, another hundred on my neck

Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(Fuck 'em when I shoot, I dwear is what I do)
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(I celebrate and finger fuck)
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(Be my most everything I do since I was two)
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(I don't know about you I don't what you gonna do)
Count on, count on
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
Is all I love to do
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
Is all I wanna do
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
All day, everyday

Thumb through the check, make sure it's adding up
Thumb thru to the check, rob a bank and bag it up
Thumb thru to the check, oh no, you ain't like that
Ain't no dear respect, make sure it ain't counterfeit
I gotta thumb thru to the check, may sure it correct
You know the nigga be playin gamble, we ain't going for that
Thumb thru the check, he planned, I paid the bounty
Quick a picker upper bitch, I'm from forty counter
Thumb through the check, on everything I love
You shake your bootie, go!
My favorite club the bootie club
Thumb to the check, I swear that shit so funge
That the hundred fifty twenties spend these 10000 warrants

Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(Fuck 'em when I shoot, I dwear is what I do)
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(I celebrate and finger fuck)
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(Be my most everything I do since I was two)
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(I don't know about you I don't what you gonna do)
Count on, count on
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
Is all I love to do
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
Is all I wanna do
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
All day, everyday

I just did a million dollar, dumped it all in 60 seconds
Count it all with one hand, finesse and thumb will do the check
Brickfare, I phone through it, free Benz I thumb to
I'm sleeping, thumbing through the check
Got money in every room
Future up and put out thumb through checks, throw them down on you
Checking my pocket, she taller than you
Thumb thru the check, thumb thru the check
I just fucked your bitch, I don't get that hoe no check
7 thousand on my neck, that's another check
Pull up at the dealer, let them thumb thru check
Thumb thru the check, finesse, finesse, finesse
Thumb through it, blow through it, juke that shit right back

Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(Fuck 'em when I shoot, I dwear is what I do)
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(I celebrate and finger fuck)
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(Be my most everything I do since I was two)
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
(I don't know about you I don't what you gonna do)
Count on, count on
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
Is all I love to do
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
Is all I wanna do
Thumb thru the check, thumb, thumb thru the check
All day, everyday
Thumb thru to the check</pre>
