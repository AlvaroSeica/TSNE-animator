When I stepped in the room
I bring the heat like the month of June
Crank the volume make the bass go boom
Wild out like we some wild baboons
We go bananas to the tune
I wanna throw 'bows, give me elbow room (move nigga)
When I'm out my cacoon I'm ready to consume
It's hit the saloon cos

It's a holiday pardon me as I celebrate
And that's the way we do it
We get a little loopy off the ignorant fluid
And act a little stupid just in case you didn't knew it
And just how we do it, don't ask why we do it
That's just the way it be
Lovin' double D's, up at the A-D
When I party in Hollywood, V-I-P
I don't understand that's T-L-E cos

We party forever and get down together
We don't stop, no, and we don't quit
Let's get it going cos you know we gon' celebrate
It's a holiday, I don't work today, or the next three days
So let's celebrate, cos it's a holiday, I don't work today, nah
Pardon me as I celebrate

It's time to celebrate
Servin' up beatbox on a hotplate
Like that y'all, we on a festive date
Make you go ape then raise your heartrate
We gon' stay out late
Party till the morning and wake up late
We do it to the day break
Go on and on and then on and on and

Dance to my rhyme
I could holla acappellas deaf till you're blind
You're mine baby
Take it to the moon for your behind baby
Take us to the moon and just recline baby
Cock my gat and stroke my nine baby
We don't stop, girl, we don't quit, no
We don't quit, no, we don't quit

We party forever and get down together
We don't stop, no, and we don't quit
Let's get it going cos you know we gon' celebrate
Cos it's a holiday, I don't work today, or the next three days
So let's celebrate cos it's a holiday, I don't work today, nah
Pardon me as I celebrate

Don't stop it, just push it
Don't stop it, just push it
Move your body and push it
Get naughty and push it
We gon' party and push it
We gon' party and push it
Move your body and push it
Get naughty and push it, cos

It's a holiday
Pardon me as I celebrate

It's time to get wasted
And scope the whole place for girls with cute faces
Cos I see some fly mamas so pack your pajamas but don't bring the drama
But you could bring your melody, I'll plug in my mic and sing my harmonies (lalalala)
For how many times we gonna hit it
How many times we gonna split it
How many times you gonna get it
Or else you are gonna wanna come over
You're gonna have to wanna, man
Cos I'm the alligator champ
Driving the train, driving the tram
Or you could bring your friend and I switch my lane
And get buddy buddy with your friend Mary Jane
She really blows my brain (brain)
She really blows my brain

We party forever and get down together
We don't stop, no, and we don't quit (yeah)
Let's get it going cos you know we gon' celebrate, said we do it everyday
Cos it's a holiday, and we do it every night, I don't work today, and we do it at the club

Yeah, uh, it's my birthday

Celebrate, cos it's a holiday, I don't work today, nah
Party as I celebrate
