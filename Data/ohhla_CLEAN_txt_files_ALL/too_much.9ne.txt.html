[Tech N9ne]
From the deepest, darkest part of Misery
Never seen before
Never heard before
Talent beyond this world
Bow down for royalty
Tech N9ne the King
Krizz Kali' the Czar
Kutt Calhoun the Prince
Too much to comprehend

[Krizz Kaliko]
There's not quite enough for me
But anyone with eyes can see

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
I'm too much for ya (too much)
Too much for ya (too much)
Too much for ya (too much)
Too much for ya (too much)
Too much for ya

[Tech N9ne]
Prepare for the ending
This is the pinnacle
All hail the King, Tech N9ne
Ain't nobody better, we coming cleverer than ever
Going head up with competitors and leveling 'em
We put 'em through the shredder, we got the lever to sever
any brethren who stepping with the Devil and uh
I'm sick of everybody thinking they ready for the work of a killer
and feeling they ill, and not saying a thing
Gotta give it up when the skill is incredible
Death is inevitable if you got trouble obeying the King
I guess when I bust I'm too much for ya
I cuss when I must, I'm too rough for ya
Tecca Nina, when I'm flowing it's a rush for ya
Other rappers on the planet, you a customer
Cause you buy it and bite on me, put your recorder right on me
cause you really ain't the shit and you stuck in debris
Now the people got the light on me, I'm about to fight on the mic
and you knowing ain't nobody fucking with me
Automatically haters be mad at me when I be ripping it
Niggas get to tripping cause I'm living it up
Got the industry in the palm of my hand and I promise I can't offend a fan
when I say I'm not giving a fuck
I'm bout the music and doing it, when the people that ruin it
When they listen it be driving me crazy
I'm different and people, they call me evil and devil
I'ma let 'em see the level of animal it made me
Cause I don't give a fuck, I just bust your crew up
Leave 'em in the dust and must chunk the juice up
Nina, Krizz and Kutt, we upchuck the new stuff
Never can ya touch or crush us we TOO MUCH!!

Why do we even do it when you don't get it?
It's like beating a dead fucking horse
Constantly giving you elite shit
and only a handful of you get it

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Too much for ya (too much)
Too much for ya (too much)
Too much for ya (too much)
Too much for ya (too much)
Too much for ya (too much)
Too much for ya (too much)
Too much for ya (too much)
Too much for ya (too much)

[Krizz Kaliko]
And I can paint a picture of words
So if you understand what you heard
[Kutt Calhoun]
Saying that you want it? I'm thinking that we way too much for ya
Setting the bar that we bout to raise too much for ya
Dolby in Digital, got to pay some bucks for the
clarity and the intricate spray (blahh blahh)
However they want it mayne, I'ma hit 'em with the bizness
Blood living could be the reason you did begun tripping
A lotta forgotten too busy rotting in the mud rivers
was niggas who got it twitted thinking they the niggas
Belvee' and Mountain Dew, out of my bodily
City of fountains, you think you hard but you hardly
compare to a rare brother, I swear that no nan other
can weather a Liz-thiz-nethal Weapon like Dan Glover
(Dangerous with this flow) come and +Kutt+ you like I'ma
(Insane, a beast in beast mode) and know you fucking with the
(Main, the beast, the sheets show) and I'll be motherfucking
(Naming pieces, it's old) I'm too much for ya

[Tech N9ne]
I don't give a fuck, I just bust your crew up
Leave 'em in the dust and must chunk the juice up
Nina, Krizz, Kutt, we upchuck the new stuff
Never can you touch or crush us, we too much
Nina, Kali' and Kutt, ain't nobody fucking with us!</pre>
