Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to sleep...
I don't wanna go to sleep...
Til the morning
Til the morning
Til the morning
Til the morning
Cause I'm a daydreamer
A daydreamer
A daydreamer
A daydreamer
N I don't wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna to sleep
Til the morning
Til the morning

[Verse 1]
Cause we got
One life to live can't be cloned
I don't care where we go
Any place but home the show goes on
Cameras action
Throwing in the air like graduates
New money new accents
A whole new world like Jasmine
Let me take you there
Probably never thought we'll make it here
I don't wanna go to sleep
But the haters tryna make my bed

They can never tuck me in
This where the fun begins
Night cap snap back
Yo dream have now been high jacked

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Cause we got insomnia
I think it's time for me to
Lighten up like Hanukkah...
If you don't mind

Let's get high

I'm feeling like I might not remember tonight
My mind
Is spacing

Can't feel nothing but the basic
Ape shit crazy do it king kong in this motherfucker
UFO parked right outside who tryna get abducted
Keep it rolling making movies we in post production
Nothing you can tell me

Just another night on Elm Street

[Chorus]

I don't wanna go sleep [3x]</pre>
