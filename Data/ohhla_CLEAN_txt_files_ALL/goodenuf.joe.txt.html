[Intro]
Uh, never good enough
Baby nothin's ever good enough
Uh, it's what? Uh

[Interlude: Joe Budden]
Nothin's ever good enough
Hollywood, think he too good for us
Nigga's emo, he ain't in the hood enough
How 'bout he's just misunderstood to us
Vision is fine, I can still hear
(So) So I pop one more 'til everything is unclear
Cause why? (Cause why?) Nothin's ever good enough
I'm just lookin for somethin, good enough

[Joe Budden]
Wonder where his mind is
If everyone's impression is wrong then maybe mine is
Jury's out, but the verdict's in
Case ain't been heard, so how they murderin him?
I appear to be arrogant, that's what they instilled in me
Took it as a weakness when I showed 'em humility
Insensitive, don't waste time tryin to tell me 
what emotions is - I'm emotionless
I can't explain it, it comes from home
Make me uncomfortable and you gon' put me in a comfort zone
Double is me, feel what I feel and know he's strugglin
Be tryin to get depression and sufferin from ME
When your head's cluttered with noise you get lost
Am I isolated by choice or by force?
Listen, the FUCK y'all expect from me?
Already given y'all the best of me
But it seem like!

[Chorus: Joe Budden]
Nothin's ever good enough
Hollywood, think he too good for us
Nigga's emo, he ain't in the hood enough
How 'bout he's just misunderstood to us
Vision is fine, I can still hear
(So I) So I pop one more 'til everything is unclear
Cause, just one wasn't good enough
Crushin it in rum wasn't good enough
The baddest girl wouldn't be good enough
All the cash in the world ain't good enough
(Why?) Cause you can go your hardest for your fans
But like you they only human so they may not understand that
I used to always try to be good enough
And couldn't figure out why I wasn't good enough
So instead of bein good enough
I just wan' be better, than good enough

[Joe Budden]
The FRUCK's goin on around here?
Contrivin and conformin is the norm around here
It's tension, speak up and violence gets mentioned
In the world where everybody gets by off silenced opinions
And so I cut the red tape and the politics
Know it's there, I'm just the only nigga to acknowledge it
Learn from the acts that came before ya and retain the lawyer
They told me, "Once you get the fame you get the paranoia"
They say that he a has-been, irrelevant
But e'ry word I say niggaz get hella bent
Tell you why I'm off of the charts, or on the bottom of your bracket
I rap through the heart and some niggaz lack it
So I get why I'm greeted with spite
Got nerve bein the truth, life's fine with them believin a lie!
Even I no longer know what to expect from me
But y'all have yet to see the best in me
Still it seem like!

[Chorus] w/ minor variatons

[Joe Budden]
Check it; I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me and you normally hear a reply for it
But I'm startin my maturation
and ignore 'em, let 'em continue they masturbation
Say my actions don't match what I'm spittin
So I tell 'em mind they business and let me stray
They say that you becomin a walkin contradiction
I tell 'em people change every day
I tell 'em I've been makin my own decisions since a teen
Tell me who the fuck is y'all to intervene - here's a lesson
I'm good enough for me, a nigga seem to be perfection
Fifty grand, V.I.P., queens, imperfections
Far from a beginner, nigga ain't a white belt
Cry me a river, and I'll turn into Mike Phelps
I'm just givin y'all the best of me
And y'all just turn that into stress for me
And so it seem like!

[Chorus] w/ minor variatons</pre>
