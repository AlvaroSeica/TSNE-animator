[Verse One: Keon Bryce]
So many girls I know
Don't wanna let me go
That is the reason why
Me and you just flow
It's like you make me glow
As soon as I see you, child
Yes, you drive me wild
Wit' your ebony smile
You are, you are, you are something special

[Chorus: Keon Bryce]
So anyway you want it
You know I'll always try
And when you need it (Girl)
You know I will provide
You know I love it (love it)
Havin' you by my side
Let's stay together (Girl)
Oh Oh

[Verse Two: Ms. Dynamite]
I never tasted such a sweet kiss
And I never felt so much tenderness
And he got me weak
He's gone five minutes and I miss him
I'm feelin' deep
Baby sit down and listen
Anytime that you ain't here you got me feenin'
For your love it feels so good it's like I'm dreamin'
Just your touch has got my heart screamin'
It's crazy baby what ya got me feelin'

[Chorus: Ms. Dynamite]
So anyway you want it
You know I'll always try
And when you need it (Boy)
You know I will provide
You know I love it (love it)
Havin' you by my side
Let's stay together (Boy)
Oh Oh

[Verse Three: Keon Bryce And Ms Dynamite]
I know something
I do see
Baby you got that love I need
You're the only one that can set me free

Boy I'll love you eternally
I don't need nobody baby
I really want you to know I love you crazy
I don't need nothin' besides
Havin' you in my life

[Chorus x2: Keon Bryce and Ms. Dynamite]</pre>
