[Chorus: Lil Reese]
We won't stop we won't stop we at the pressure
Just look at my squad since a youngin we been with it
Only the strong survive and you niggaz is bitches
Pull up on yo block with 30's that's a mission
Pulling with my squad that a damn mission
Don't come around me not a shooter then get missing
He might be a police he working what's the business
And you niggaz don't know me then working what's the business

[Verse: Lil Reese]
I fuck with o-block 300 that's my niggaz
Add up both block that to many killas
Yo bitch gone fuck both block she know that we them niggaz
Stay away from lame niggaz we don't fuck with you pretender
Keep the heater when its cold incase we have to burn a nigga
I come from that block lamron 300 nigga
Got my broski in the cut and we ain't fighting with cha
If you all about money then we'll get it with cha
Acting like you can't get touch some niggaz will deal with ya

I ain't really gotta talk since a youngin been that nigga
Otf and gbe bitch 300 bitch we them niggaz

[Chorus]

[Verse: Chief Keef]
