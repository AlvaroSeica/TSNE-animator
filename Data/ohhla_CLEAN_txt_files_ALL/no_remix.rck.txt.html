(And I go hard for that paper) {"J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League"}

[Chorus: Future]
Can't play no GAMES with these niggas, can't play no GAMES with these hoes
They treat us like the Goodfellas everywhere that we go
No games, no games - no gaaaa-aaaaaames
Can't play no GAMES with these niggas, can't play no GAMES with these hoes
They treat us like the Goodfellas everywhere that we go
No no no no no no no no no no no noooo, no no no no no no - no games

[Future] + (Rick Ross)
Ain't no bottles on yo' table, pussy boy go get yo' gwolla

[Rick Ross]
The world is yours, I've got them calling me Tony (HUH!)
Double M on the top, nigga we bigger than Sony
If you step on my toes, I write your name on my wall (Boss!)
He claim that he a soldier, fold up a flag for his momma (hold up!)
I've got gold in my blood, born a son of a king (HUH!)
I'm as real as they come, oh it's a wonderful dream (WHOO!)
On the phone Farrakhan gave me my first Quran (yes)
We joined hands, said a prayer, may Allah bless the don (the don!)
Ain't nowhere to run, already sold out the seats (HUH!)
We been them niggas, better go ask them freaks (freaks)
Lipstick on my cheeks, extortion all through my vows (my vows)
They say it's suspicious all this money I found (I found)
Go give me the crown, you niggas been in denial (lay down)
We the hottest niggas out, my nigga Kanye'll vouch {Maybach Music}
The +Devil in a Dress+ (dress) Rozay in the chest (yes)
Push it to the limit, it's a OG in the flesh
Countach on the prowl, Lamborghinis I fiend (HUH!)
Ferrari addiction bitch it's a wonderful thing (WHOO!)
I need me a needle cause Double R like to lean (HUH!)
Mastermind on the way, top of 2014 (HUH!)

[Chorus] w/ ad-libs

[Meek Mill]
Okay! Petticoat is in that Rafe (WOO) heard her say I look like steak (what)
All these fuckin' ass fish (strapped) nigga take a look at my face (yeah)
I was never known for rentin' (nah) gon' and take a look at my plate
Paper, taggin', when I, mash, glide, do it like a nigga on skates - WOO!
I don't even think they see me (see me) hoes disappear, Houdini (poof)
I get what I wanna (wanna) you would think I own a genie (genie)
If I ain't on my corner (corner) probably on your TV (TV)
Pimping these hoes like +Joseline+ (Joseline) "Why you do that +Stevie+?"
Play no games with these bitches, they treat me like I'm Tony
I put cheese on you rats, get hit with that macaroni (BLRRT~!)
'Bout them collard greens all these rappers be actin' phony
You sold your soul for some food and went broke, now you salty
You want your cornbread? Give me that, give me that, get me that
Niggas that's old bread; spendin' that, flippin' that, get it back
with my old heads; small face hundred, my nigga
We call that more bread; you don't want me goin' in!
Meek Milly~!

[Chorus] w/ ad-libs

Look, I ain't tryna be no killer but I know I got beaucoup of 'em that's with me (whoa)

You get them Jordan feet, I give these hoes Mutumbo fingers (WOO!)

And I pick 'em apart with that flow (yeah) and my car beyond what y'all drove (VROOM)
