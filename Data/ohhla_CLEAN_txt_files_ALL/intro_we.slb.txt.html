(*talking*)
S.L.A.B., Slow Loud And Bangin'
These motherfuckers, act like we was gone somewhere
Bitch we still in the game, and we still running shit
It's bout time I set it off round this motherfucker, Boss

[Boss]
I tell a motherfucker, check out the grill
Check out the steel, check out the fifth wheel
Scope out the belts and bumpers, on back of the black Lac
I got a black Mac, in a backpack
Lil' nigga, known to bang to the tip-top
Zip a nigga, in a six foot Ziplock
Make a talking ass nigga, get a lip lock
I've been rapping for the cash, fuck hip-hop
Bitch niggaz, don't get far
Boss bout to make a nigga, get a big scar
Are you ready, for the big war
Got big G's, hopping out of big blue cars
Big blue stars on our feet, nigga don't slip with the heat
Niggaz go to sleep, with the heat
With a toe tag, on his feet
When we creep, ain't a damn thang sweet

[Trae]
Better watch out, 'fore you open your mouth up
Cause niggaz out the H, might beat your block up
Dropped on the block, with the top done popped up
Fell back the trunk, and unlock the knocked up
Look at the grill on my car, look at the grill in my mouth
Look at the grill, on top of the big truck
Cuts in my mouth, it's invisible stuff
Get back bitch, 'fore a nigga get rough
I got a 4-5, and I bet I don't bluff
I got a bad bitch, but a nigga don't cuff
Seem real high, but a nigga don't puff (a nigga don't puff)
Not on the weed, but I'm riding hydro
Might get killed, for everything that I know
But I got way mo' tips, than hollow
To make a nigga don't want drama, no mo'
Don't get blessed, run in your mouth
A click of guerillas, might run in your house
On top of that, we might run in your spouse
The same way, that a nigga run through the South
We G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Running from the laws, from around my way
Ain't no way, to get around my K
Deep down South, is what I rep everyday

(*talking*)
This is just the beginning of this shit
Assholes By Nature nigga, Slow Loud And Bangin'
Motherfuckers running round here, really smelling theyself
I outta put you hoes back in place, back and touch your toe self
So you know the real, and you know what's not
Nigga S.L.A.B. been in this shit, we been in these streets
We running this shit nigga, simple and plain
Screwed Up Click, Assholes By Nature, Slow Loud And Bangin'
Ain't shit changed round here baby, we gon keep it gutter a hundred percent
We been on this pain shit for real, peep game recognize
Look at the grill, bitch ass motherfuckers</pre>
