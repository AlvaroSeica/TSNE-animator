[Chorus]
You think you using me
like this games new to me
but you aint confusing me
you just want jewelry and all them fuckin shopping sprees
but that aint stopping me
and I aint stopping you
see we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
just play your part
just play your part
we'll be cool as long as you just play your part

[Rick Ross]
I'm incline with women who come on they time
she came over and she came a few times
from crispy futons to Christian Louboutin
game over had her shopping in Milan
20 racks really thats sneaker money
triple white Ferrari yeah thats the Easter bunny
at the Ceaser in Vegas yeah I put the Visa on it
now all she do is tell me how she used to love me
I let her decorate the real estate
and I let her spend a half the ticket give or take
a couple dollars Harry Winstone stone collars
canary yellow everything plane chartered
I spolied her maybe 'cause I adored her
more than fly that girls a flying saucer
my Mona Lisa painting on the wall came to life
and she said the love of picture just roll the dice

[Chorus]
you think you using me
like this games new to me
but you aint confusing me
you just want jewelry and all them fuckin shopping sprees
but that aint stopping me
and I aint stopping you
see we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
just play your part
just play your part
we'll be cool as long as you just play your part

[Wale]
I try to love 'em in the physical not literal
she said she love me but what I'm feeling is minuscule
I understand that Prada lives in her inner soul
so the devil that droves in her got in control
Anne Hathaway, and sack chasin' getting got cake up
though my paper way thicker than model make up
but ya'll wait up my mind racing my toe slippin
a lot of women is real some bitches Robin Givings
I never give 'em no liquid no pot to piss in
I tend to leave them quite offended if they too dependent
I'm pitchin bitches thats dreamin' thinking I'm trickin' chicken
I'm simply fuckin' with bitches that know they whole position
thats real nigga shit
real nigga life
I give my heart to one broad, the others get the pipe
I aint tryna fight, I aint tryna fuss
I trying for the money, they tryna fall in love

[Chorus]
you think you using me
like this games new to me
but you aint confusing me
you just want jewelry and all them fuckin shopping sprees
but that aint stopping me,
and I aint stopping you
see we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
just play your part
just play your part
we'll be cool as long as you just play your part

[Meek Mill]
I say, how can they compare to you
everything material
trickin' shit for kids and you know I dont need no cereal
you know I was ridin' and you switched up a gear or two
so I let others shit you on dead, burial
funeral, check my phone, reacting like its new to you
talking what I give but never speak on what I do for you
Cabo to Jamaica every weekend honey moon and you
like the sound and I aint ever try tuning you
but now I'm just assuming you
living off of hearsay
treble like the radio 'cause everything was fair play
1st class herm ass
Panamera perp pass
greed written on her face
when I bought her first bag
and I aint really give a fuck
It was like a nigga rushed
told my jeweler make her freeze like I was tryna stick her up
she call me daddy like a nigga puff
just play your role and you can live it up

[Chorus]
you think you using me
like this games new to me
but you aint confusing me
you just want jewelry and all them fuckin shopping sprees
but that aint stopping me
and I aint stopping you
see we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
just play your part
just play your part
we'll be cool as long as you just play your part</pre>
