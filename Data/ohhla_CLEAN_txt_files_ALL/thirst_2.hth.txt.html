"As sure as the sun rises in the east
 It also sets in the west"

"The sun is much more than a giant lightbulb
 There are other forces at work in the sun"

"The sun is a sphere of hot, seething gases
 and surges of radiation"

"The sun is so large
 it would take a hundred and nine Earths strung end to end to equal its diameter"

"How do you capture a piece of the sun?"

"Hilltop Hoods"

"And then the sun, we'll expect a connection to the sun"

Well, 'Drinking from the Sun' is kinda like, it's a metaphor that you know
We're, we're from a, we're from an underground culture that's kind of risen up into, into the limelight
So we're sort of from, from down below drinking from what's coming above</pre>
