my momma allways told me aim for the sky
so I came out aimin bangin at guys
it was mainly slangin kane by the pies
and the fiends was payin for dangerous high
o b and amonia we mix it down
no sleep on the corner the pitch mound
and police when the saw us they frisk us down
we all hate marajuwana and coke now
so tell bloomberg its a rezy
take it back to 88 and move byrds though my city
dw bridge new jerz wit the pizy 38 a key for a byrd
they get busy
fuck the phone getthe word by mouth
when the winter roll around no byrds fly south
fuck the cops got hella folks in prison
hand over the option
but the cell codes still livin

[Chorus]

[Cam'ron]
