[Intro: Danny!]
Yeah, +Payback+ is a bitch
Misunderstood, yeah..
So misunderstood, it's like..
D. Swain, Lil B, Blu
You know, the definition
Yeah, check it..

[Lil B]
I'm the definition f'real
Lil B..
Yeah, I'm so misunderstood, when I'm in the hood 
Mindset so far like I'm in the woods
He left the game too soon like Tiger Woods
If I make a couple million, I'm good
They think that I changed since I drive a Bentley
I'm still the same man and my brain not empty
I still see the hate cause the game is in me
They try to take my food cause they say I'm friendly
But they don't want no war with the beast that's in me
I leave 'em underground, now they life is history
Sometimes I feel like the world's against me
I keep my head up, stay away from ten feet
Keep cool, calm, and collected
Jay-Z, you my fam, cause our paths intercepted
In New York, respected
Live one life so it's always a blessing
Misunderstood ain't close to me
I'm the definition, I'm the hope you see
I came from the bottom, I was broke for free
But now I'm on top, you take a note from me
But stay humble, if y'all could lose it
They say, life's a movie
..Uh, yeah.. we could lose it
Life's a movie, I'm misunderstood

It's lil bars, the truth definition..

[Danny!]
Check it..
Now as I walk into the studio, smokin some hash
with Lil B, I get a call from Rick's dad
Said his girlfriend Tina, she just went back to rehab
But when I heard it, I just looked at my pad
Now see on the secondhand, they've already been through a lot
When Rick and Tina got together, she been off of that rock
for 'bout a year and change, niggas tellin Rick, "You're insane!"
But when you love someone enough, you get immune to the pain
Now Tina lost her mom and dad when she was young and was orphaned
Was raped at seventeen and had to get an abortion
She never trusted a soul, but she trusted Rick
Persistent little nigga, went to college and shit
He saw the beauty in her, but it was never enough
Because the taunting and the teasing Rick was doin is too much
She didn't wanna put him through that, so she went back to the crack
Man... she ain't had to do that!
She probably coulda talked to Rick and Rick'll tell her
to turn a blind eye to it all like Helen Keller
Instead, she let it get to her and now she relapse
Two steps forward and three steps back
I could've rapped about my hard times to this song..
but heavens know I would've been wrong
I wouldn't've been right, y'all wouldn't've cared anyway
It wouldn't've been life, it wouldn't've been good
So misunderstood

[Blu]
Ahhhhhh!! She didn't know me, she didn't want to
She didn't want to want to want you
She told a different story then I'm goin to
She kept goin and goin, now I'm gone too
I'm in the liquor store, nigga don't fuck with me
Tryna get some dope to cope, a blunt and leave
I'm thinkin 'bout a better day
She told me 'bout it back when I was proud and
told me she would see me out another way
But she never did, the devil stay
Bought a dress walked around my house like she never came, dang
Ghostface Killah up in this bitch
I got a knife and a bat and a hammer, what's good?
I could bust ya shit, cut ya shit 
Cripple a nigga, need a crutch and shit
Just to get up out the drama
I'm appalled by the god in this bitch
She think she's Cher, no Sonny she don't even care
It ain't funny I'm a bear walk around bare-naked 
countin money with a woman bare, naked in the chair 
in front of me (What, the... FUCK?~!) Understand?
Didn't think so bro because the flow's so misunderstood

Danny! Lil B
B-L.. U, SUCKAS!!
