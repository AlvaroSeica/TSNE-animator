[Intro: Timbo King]
Yo, yo, Brooklyn
Bedstuy to Crown Heights
Getting slapped up
Bay Honor, Fort Greene
East New York, so...

[Chorus: Timbo King]
Brownsville, we don't give a fuck about a deal
Brownsville, we don't give a fuck about a deal
Brownsville, we don't give a fuck about a deal
Brownsville, we don't give...

[Timbo King]
Yeah, yo, Ocean Hill, tenth floor, inside B.O.'s crib
Counting big heads, smoking on endo wib
Meets on Sunny days, I got slapped with a horn
What's popping? You know how we do, stacking them coins
Money to get, fiends want dimes and better
Wiping asses off my Brickface sweater
Tailor made, imported from Church Ave
Yeah, I bought it from Church Ave
Reminiscing on '69 and how it went down
That shit wouldn't have happened if Armel was around
You'se a bus boy, a straight Greyhound bus boy
The game foul, who could you trust, boy?
Bo, weapon, King, repping Brook, crook
Go 'head and move, rook, smoking tobacco
El Blacko, slap niggaz, I mean what I say
I say what I mean, it's gangsta lean
Tim Brown, I want big money
You know "Ready to Die", BIG money
Keep food up in the fridge money
Revolutionary gun talk, let's ride on 'em
Let's ride on 'em, B.V.I.

[Chorus: Timbo King]
Brownsville, we don't give a fuck about a deal</pre>
