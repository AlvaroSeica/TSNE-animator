[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Slaughterhouse, Busta Bust
Somebody better hurry up and find the nearest fuckin exit
Joe Budden, c'mon!

[Joe Budden]
Yo, 'bout to barge our way through, they wouldn't open the door
First time high, they couldn't know it was raw
Would die if you smoked it, too potent to snort
If you think by the bar you'd probably choke on a thought
(WHAT UP! WHAT UP! WHAT UP!) Speed-dial a coroner
Done with subliminals, now I'm talkin to all of ya
Tryin my patience, wearin it thin
I put my prints on your heart without piercin the skin, again
(WHAT UP! WHAT UP! WHAT UP!) I only need knuckles
Tell him to travel safe then make his knees buckle
'Fore they love you they gotta hate you
They say that real recognize real, dawg we can spot fake too

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Y'all know what it is, cause we do it often
Caught another body, buy another coffin
(WHAT UP! WHAT UP! WHAT UP!) Buy another coffin!
(WHAT UP! WHAT UP! WHAT UP!) Buy another coffin!
We burn shit down, blowtorch scorchin
Slaughterhouse bitch! Buy another coffin
(WHAT UP! WHAT UP! WHAT UP!) Buy another coffin!
(WHAT UP! WHAT UP! WHAT UP!) Buy another coffin!

[Joell Ortiz]
Knick-knack paddy-wack, Yaowa want a bone
Click-clack, acrobat a coward with the chrome
Purchase another casket, I'm murderin ya bastards
My Desert Eagle's a bird, dirty lil' ratchet
Loser ponder ya when a hollow wan' touch ya
Screamin "WOO HAH!!" when I +Busta Bust+ ya
I dress my baby up, she got a custom muffler
She be like "pyoo-pyoo," you be like "uh-uh-uh-uh"
Then you lean with it, then you drop with it
Next time I tell you shoot, put a sock in it
(What up! What up! What up!) Act calm chief
We Sas-squash beef, Big-foot up your butt, shut up

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
The most beautifulest thing in this world
are the funerals I bring to this world
(What up, what up, what up) Gimme the beat I'ma body it
John Gotti it, Crooked probably body the audience
(What up, what up, what up) Then I'm tryin to find a whore
Dick in that vagina like I'm minin for diamonds or
I'm tryin to find China or some kind of dinosaur
Tryin to score like Kentucky in the Final Four
Yeah, you niggaz still wussy
My gun is my other dick cause it kill pussies
I'm hood, you good? I'm just checkin homie
Still +Hammer Dancin+, two-steppin with my weapon on
Weapon on, weapon on, weapon on, weapon on me

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I said if I ain't fuckin wit'chu you can suck a short-for-Richard
until you hiccup, hiccup, need I say - more?
Listenin to a free beat by Dre
in some free Beats by Dre - or
Tell my attorney to cook it and eat it; I'm playin catch 
with the body of Bernie from "Weekend at Bernie's" with Crooked this evenin
I'm up in y'all spot with Jersey Joe Walcott and Brooklyn Ortiz
Just please give us a reason
(WHAT UP! WHAT UP! WHAT UP!) Fuck all the singin
I'm about to be a rich nigga and waste the whole last bar screamin
You ready? {*screams*} Hook

[Chorus]

[Outro: Royce]
Yeah, what's up world?
Y'all hear us now? Ha ha
We here, you ready? {*screams*}</pre>
