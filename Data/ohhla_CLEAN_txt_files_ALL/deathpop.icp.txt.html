Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Party
It's what you choose
Wild and wicked, you abuse
Well fuck it
No need to heed
The hell with caution increase the speed
Push it
Impress the west
Run up and tell you ain't bought the dress
You crazy
Don't care about nuttin
We'll see when that coffee's shuttin

[Chorus]
We're the mighty death pop
Everything stop
You either rise or drop
(Livin on the wild side
Just hope it's a long ride)
We're the mighty death pop
Everything stop
You either rise or drop
(You keep prayin he will come
When it all shuts off, you done)
Rock on
Drop that confetti
The death pop's when you ain't ready
Hey, thanks, I hope you don't get sacked
He comes, we'll perform (the death pop)
Let your balls hang out if you wanna
But don't cry when they get kicked (get kicked)
The black out's sudden end to your party
The mighty death pop happens quick
Every day throw it up, celebrate life
Cause that shit could pop tonight
Make noise
If he hears about you
Suddenly we're without you

When it goes pop
And then it goes pop
And then it goes...
You crazy ass fool
You mean to stop
So what, you on top
(THE MIGHTY DEATH POP)
Yeah, and he goes by request
Live life a train wreck
If you want the trouble
He'll pop your bubble
And then drop you
On the double
Believe it your buzzer
It's gettin pushed
He loves the risky rock n roll
Who gives a fuck

When it goes pop
And then it goes pop
When it goes pop
And then it goes</pre>
