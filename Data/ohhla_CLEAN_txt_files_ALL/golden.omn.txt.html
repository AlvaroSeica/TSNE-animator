[Aceyalone] omni
[Omni] yeah
[Aceyalone] what it do?
[Omni] you know
[Aceyalone] alright let's get it done

[Aceyalone]
we stay ground like ???
got a aim like oswald
mic jack 'em off the wall
I'm glad I'm not as soft as ya'll
this is for all of ya'll who didn't see it coming
you, your partner, your people, your funky ass woman
let it be known we on some world wide
deep and wide
keep it tight
freak the mic
I can barely sleep at night
I mean I'm sleepin' light
anphetamines, dopamine
you ain't got no choice but let it slip right through a opening
that's why I'm focusing on spittin' it in a real way
I'mma have a field day until they
get they shit together or
that's not what we settle for
signed, sealed forever yours
soldiers in this war
from the city to the suburbs
overseas to inner sticks
hell yeah we in the mix
and you on some chicken shit
dumb shit
bullshit
bumbaclot biya
I'm a-c-e-y alone
with the free eye
yeah

[Chorus]

[Aceyalone]
they try to step the plate
but they don't want none
try to get a piece of the cake
but they don't want none
try to test the golden state
but they don't want none
I'm on some
come if you can
or just don't come
they try to step the plate
but they don't want none
try to get a piece of the cake
but they don't want none
try to test the golden state
but they don't want none
I'm on some
come if you can
or just don't come

[Omni]
I'm at it again
I caught my second wind
I got the city crackin' like niggaz and mexicans
welcome to california
where the women and weed
emcees, gangstas and criminals
shit you wouldn't believe
it's going down in the streets
you gotta hustle to eat
these niggaz prey on the weak just to stay on they feet
people listen to me when I speak
so I tell 'em uncock the heat when I rock the beat
get a crippled nigga out his seat
check the resume
let me show you how to emcee
this is legalized dope
international
everywhere I'm ???
buy it in bulk
no collateral
can't fuck with my calvary
I'll drop a quarter on you from a twenty story balcony
blaaaw
you get a hole in your head
a fuckin hole in your head
I put you in the back and hide your skull from the feds
all the witness saw was a dread
five blocks from the hash box
stash box in my bubble jacket pad lock
bad cops
we call 'em matlock in bat talk
heading down the coast with the jackpot

[Chorus]

[Aceyalone]
but they don't want none
but they don't want none
but they don't want none
oh just don't come</pre>
