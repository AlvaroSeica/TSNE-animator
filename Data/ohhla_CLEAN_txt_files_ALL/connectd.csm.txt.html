[Intro]
This real tough
Whassup Cosm? Trust me

[Chorus]
We connected like a bridge in Connecticut
Except this is Edmonton, Alberta, Canada wherever it is
I be with Toronto and stick to Edson
Did I ever go to Brooklyn? Yup~! You bet I did
We connected like a bridge in Connecticut
Except this is Edmonton, Alberta, Canada wherever it is
I be with Toronto and stick to Edson
I'm up North of the border, Edmonton represent

[Touch]
Yo, I ain't even gotta reiterate, how I spit with the great
Edmonton rappers, that'll have you on their dinner plate
From Abbots-fuckin-field to Mill Gate
Out of town rappers, this ain't prime real estate
Move on to the next city maybe they can faciliate
your curious nature, or do I have to illustrate
the meaning of "move on" we got this shit fuckin locked (down)
I can name just a few rappers from around my block
I'm on 118 with Plex and Relik beatmaking
Or in Millwoods at Juice buying a "peep game" tee
Canadian rappers, I acknowledge my pride
at the WCMA awards with Four Blunt and Politic Live
Can't forget B-E-C makin moves
with Lo Pressure and the Dirty Cru, you know me
But for real, I travel East, drop rhymes on the coast
with Ghettosocks and Paramedic, Fat Matt was our host

[Chorus]

[Touch]
Yo, I just scan my scope, find emcees that's dope
And travel to as many cities as possible like the Pope
I'm in Calgary with Planet, none of y'all can stand it
You see me roll up, like some Whatevski and Panic
Shows on 17th, we get props from the entire crowd
Dragon Fli rappers are my Empire
With Cosm and Teekay, peepin Metawon
and the beats he play when he deejay
Travel to Saskatoon with Epic, after a sandwich
head to the University and hook up with Chaps
And I mean, Chaps Casanova, say whattup to Factor
and we'll hit up Stinson's and meet at {?} after
Drive to Winnipeg, signed my first titties
Mother and daughters, plus the hash they had was nippy
Did your Roots concert for free show
The same day Desert Storm popped off, the planet Earth looked bleak bro

[Chorus]

[Touch]
Rough Rhymes and Monty, and let me tell you somethin
From Frederickton to Charlotte town those are all raw banks
It's pumpin, we at his mom's crib when Katrina hit
Put a dent in the pumps when gas was at $1.15, shit

* would appreciate any corrections on Edmonton rap names and locations</pre>
