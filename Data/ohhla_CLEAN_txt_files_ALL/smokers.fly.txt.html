Chorus: Ese Daz
Come fly with me (Let's get high)
Take a hit of mari (Let's get high)
We smokin', smokin', smokin' (Let's get high)
We tokin', tokin', tokin' (Let's get high)
Come fly with me (Let's get high)
Take a hit of mari (Let's get high)
We smokin', smokin', smokin' (Let's get high)
We tokin', tokin', tokin'

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 1: Ese Daz]
Wouldn't you like to go with me on a peaceful journey?
Stricken, just smokin' with ya family
Get away from your 9-5
Stressed out, burned out, leave all your troubles behind
Paying no mind
Come roll
With me
Take a hit
Indo, mary jane, get rid of the pain
Life be real like Cheech &amp; Chong, come on, just hit the bong
So pass the douchie to the left hand side
Inhale, exhale, make you feel alright
I got ya feeling free and hairy, like Bob Marley
Spanish groove, Latin yesca, that's who we be
And after P3
We're at the Deuce Three
E-Dubb, Khool-Aid, Knoc-turn'al and all the homies
Motivated to get intoxicated, wasted, faded
Inflated, so meditated, now my pain's all leviated
So here's a toast, from me to you
Smoke it up, drink it up, whatever you wanna do, oooh

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Johnny D]
Sit back, relax and enjoy ya high
We tell ya ways of a N-Y-D, from killa Cali, Spanish F.L.Y
Got ya lifted
Y-O-U up high, floatin' through the sky
Don't trip
It's a Friday high night
With some
Bomb, chron' in the
G bong
I don't smoke everyday, but every other day in song
Forget about your troubles, ain't nobody burstin' bubbles
Everybody forms a huddle when we smokin' on that trouble
Come on, let's all, let's ride, get high
To the limit
Take a trip and step into my mind
Picture this {*exhale*}
Then I pass it to the right of me
Frisky, giving up the ass to get high with D
Drastic
If I ain't got none in my system
I had a chance to get some pussy, but I had to viz
For that grassy green, indo weed
Put ya lips on mari and come fly with me

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: El Fino]
Pardon me, excuse me, while I
Kiss the sky
Purple haze be the ticket to smoker's paradise
Take a hit of the mari-j-uana, time to take flight
Jump on the wings on the pilot, enjoy the ride
Stop..
Now feel the effects of the high
Sittin' on top of the world
Stomp on light
Looking down from cloud nine, living life, watching time fly
T-H-C helps to stimulate the mind
4/20 365, 24-7
I'm smoking a blunt
As I'm walking up the stairway to heaven
It's all
Natural
God's gift to man
A sticky-icky that we smoke from L.A. to Amsterdam
So let's
Fire it up, take a hit, but don't choke
Prepare ya, fill ya lungs of all that Harley smoke
Relax your mind and let your soul be free
Get up, stand up, come fly with me

Repeat Chorus

[Ese Daz]
Let's get high
Let's get high
Let's get high
Let's get high
Let's get high
Let's get high
Let's get high</pre>
