[Verse One: Sean Price]
P! Uh! Black folks, crack smoke
Big head scientist, island of Patmos
Fake tears and snakes here
Crunchin my thumb 'cause I ain't shoot a nigga in 8 years
Sets a period
Period rex gettin interior air
And your livin your death inferior
Uh! Listen, it's so thuggish to sniff 'caine
Make me cold blooded motherfucker I'm Rick James
Hell of a drug, Sean Price, hell Of A Thug
Hang with Sheen, I got elephant blood
Listen to me, y'all better not listen to me
Fuck around and catch a case tryin to be like P
Listen, a ring on you brother, I'm, harmin you daily
Clown, Ringling Bros and Barnum and Bailey
P, now download this on your disc
If you under 21 you shouldn't listen to this
Bitch!!!

[Chorus: Statik Selektah Scratchin] (Mac Miller)

(Let me light this motherfuckin weed I'm smokin)
Y-Y-You shouldn't listen-Y-Y-You shouldn't listen to this-"Styles P"
(Yeah! Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah! For real! Light the crackpipe so I know it's real)
Li-Li-Li-Listen-Li-Li-Listen-L-L-L-L-Listen to this-"Styles P"

[Verse Three: Mac Miller]
Whoa! Young Bill Murray
I'm 21 but I feel 30
A little birdy out in Jersey said my raps were too wordy
Toild his bitch to suck my dick and do a curtsy, dirty, slurpy
I smell earthy, puttin curry on my turkey
I'm +Blade 3+ your more like +Blades Of Fury+
Blonde dykes love me for my Klondike tummy
Gettin all types of money, I'm with Sean Price, dummy, P
Police stuntin at a nice while luncheon
Met your wife, pipe plumbin let to all night humpin
Oh no, the end of your life comin
We the tribe, don't make me Phife somethin
My bitch from Beirut she get loose
110 proof, call me Zeus, pussy tighter than a wet suit
Jesus Christ, he so nice

[Chorus: Statik Selektah Scratchin]
If you under 21 you shouldn't listen to this-"Styles P"
I-I-I-I-If you under 21 you shouldn't listen to this-y-y-you shouldn't listen to this-"Styles P"
Y-Y-You shouldn't listen-Y-Y-You shouldn't listen to this-"Styles P"
Li-Li-Li-Listen-Li-Li-Listen-L-L-L-L-Listen to this-"Styles P"</pre>
