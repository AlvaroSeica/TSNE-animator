Jesus!
Hahahaha, knahmean? Trust me baby
F'real man
Aiyyo Khrysis
My life will still be existin while I shit on opponents B
Aiyyo, listen

All joking aside, all vocals aside
I will fuck yo' ass up pah; fuck I look like huh?
Yeah, now back to the music, some niggaz backpack to the music
When I rap, I smoke black and sell crack to the music
Even practice givin dap to the music, they like "Ruckus you're rad"
My son like "They can't fuck wit'chu dad~!" True
I'm puffin the 'dro, I'm clutchin the fo'
Sell a verse for a G pah, hustle and flow
You can't act like you don't but motherfuckers all know
Who's the nicest Sean Price is motherfucker let's go
Go, line for line, rhyme for rhyme
Ten paces turn around shoot nine for nine
You can tell by the rhyme it's my time to shine
Let's eat, motherfucker I don't dine on swine
I don't beef with turkeys I told you the God'll fold you
Hard to digest I suggest that you take tofu

[Chorus]
Aiyyo I hate niggaz like you, fake niggaz like you
Take niggaz like you, shake niggaz like you
Punch you in the face, straight break niggaz like you
When I'm high no tellin the fuck Ruck might do
Hate niggaz like you, fake niggaz like you
Take niggaz like you, shake niggaz like you
Punch you in the face, straight break niggaz like you
When I'm high no tellin the fuck Ruck might do

[Sean Price]
Aiyyo, I mastered "The Art of War" before a nigga read Sun Tzu
Third degree black belt master of gun-fu
Pop pills, smoke weed, even get drunk too
And you do what you can and I do what I want to
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck wit
Boot Camp Clik ain't nuttin ta Wu-Tang
Niggaz seem shocked by the way that I do thangs
I'm with Destiny's Child, I still ride the 2 train
Sometimes I feel like I'm the best in my field
But I'm not and I'm broke so I go invest in some krillz
My nerd niggaz say fuck rap and find you a trade
I got weight on the plate bitch, find me a blade
I'm tryin to get paid, yo' punk ass is tryin to get robbed
Gimme the gauge, excuse me while I get on my job
Listen, Sean Price is the nicest to write poems
I never sing the same shit, twice like Mike Jones

[Chorus]
