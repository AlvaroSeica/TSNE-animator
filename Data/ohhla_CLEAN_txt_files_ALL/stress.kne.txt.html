Hey Nigga
This is our last time bonita
After this, we out
I'm tellin you
We die together
An eye for an eye (In Italian)
A tooth for a tooth (In Italian)
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
All my niggas 
Feel me

[Verse 1]
I can't rest 
So much stress to live illegal
My uncle on death row
Waiting to get the needle
Holla if you hear me, people
This dope game is evil
A bloody river runnin through the ghetto
That new born baby
In the dumpster
She been dead for a week
While the dope fiend momma
Gettin high on the street
Gettin beat by police
Still prayin for peace
Niggas playin for keeps
Yellow tape and white sheets
And time is going by so slowy
I plead insanity
My family my homies
Sick of swallowing rocks
To avoid them cops on the block
Sick of judges, lawyers, and cell blocks
This ghetto got me thinkin about death
When will it stop
Either you punch the clock
Or you open up shop

Chorus

Everyday I'm livin with stress
So I smoke the cess (I don't wanna die in the ghetto)
To the get the pain of my chest 

Everyday I'm livin with stress
So I smoke the cess  (Please don't let me die in the ghetto)
To the get the pain of my chest

Everyday I'm livin with stress
So I smoke the cess (I don't wanna die in the ghetto)
To the get the pain of my chest

Everyday I'm livin with stress
So I smoke the cess  (Please don't let me die in the ghetto)
To the get the pain of my chest


[Verse 2]
Gettin murdered by the hands of a buster
Over respect
Last night my little homie cought a bullet in the neck
Look in his eyes
He kinda looked surprised in his last breath
But life goes on for niggas 
Throwin up they set
In terror
In the ghetto when this shit ain't stoppin
Niggas run in your crib
And make references to why your momma
Washin fiends
Never with a fly
Chasin a high
And gettin AIDS from a bitch 
Ain't no way to die
And everyday I'm seeing signs 
Of the end of the world
My nigga Bobby killed himself and his lady
In front of his baby girl
Feds, watch a nigga 
Tryin to make the bus
But niggas stay strapped
And gats, we trust (C'mon)

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Bill Clinton in the White House
Fucking hoes
Innocent kids gettin shot on my block
Casket closed
Hear the niggas in the cell blocks
Screaming for freedom
Tryin to cop a cigarette for stress
Cause they need them
Remember JJ got shot
In a high speed chase
Busted in the back 
Through the license plate
My reality is fatality
I verbalize pain before I be another casualty
Infared beam on the glock
Just aim and pop
You see me for a split second 
And your dead and got
I try to tell these young kids
Go to school
They wanna smoke weed, gang bang, and act a fool
They don't hear me though

[Talking]
Yeah man
It's sad you know
We ain't got no jump shot
Can't play football
We ain't got no money for college
But I see these niggas on the block
Rolling with their fancy cars
Fancy gold
Fancy hoes
Nigga, I'ma get it how I live
You know
I'ma y'all young niggas some advice
Don't get greedy nigga
Get what you came for
To many niggas dying 
Trying to prove something to another nigga
Be true to yourself
True to what you know nigga
Stay true to the gizzame</pre>
