[Yo, what's up bro, I'm just callin' to let you know what's up
All is good, all is swell over here, I responded to your e-mail
So you know, you can check that, and I got you a little gift
It's called a narghil√®, when you get to town
But when you get it, man, breathe easy, you know, don't kill yourself]

A worn rhyme book made of suede leather
letters on the page light as a feather, but... {x3}
Heavy as they come I become one with the drum
cymbal-tongue, very few can do it better...
A worn rhyme book made of suede leather
letters on the page light as a feather, but
Heavy as they come I become one with the drum
cymbal-tongue, very few can do it better
Now, I've been known to do my thing on the mic here and there
some local some faraway from home
And every place that I've flown
you ask the people that were there and they tell you how the spot was blown

[Agent 006]
More like blown to bits, the way the bass hits
Thump it in your trunk, I suggest usin' nothin' less than fifteen-inch
Surreal surround, the bass pounds, the highs pierce
Similar to being punched and pinched
The way I describe this is inexplicable, something like a miracle
Absolute bliss, while you were sleeping we accomplished this
Here to make the constipated say that's the shit

[Chorus]
I got an idea that I wanna share
You don't like it, so what?, I don't care
Throw your hands up, keep em in the air,
Don't wanna roll wit' it? fuck up outta here!
We only rockin' for the live ones (right here!) [x2]
I got an idea, that I wanna share
You don't like it, so what? I don't care

[Asheru]
Just spit to make the people take a pause
The result is applause and dropped jaws
Yes y'alls ain't enough these days
I'll believe it when I see your hands raised, where they at now?
That's better, didn't have to persuade ya'
In the band you know I played the drum major
Teenagers to old timers with Alzheimer's
Thugs, scholars, tree-huggers and wall climbers, let's go!
To a different direction on your selection
I'm only glowing your reflection
And if you leave here knowing, then half the battle's already won
I'm glad we makin' a connection
B.M.I.G., you know the mantra, ya' know Bob Marley Inhaled Ganja
Ya' know that to lock in me in the lab with the same and a pad and a pen
The finished product is bonkers

[Agent 006]
This beat I designed for you to wiggle your butt
Put the CD on repeat and rock on
No matter if you're anorexic or you've got a gut
Put on a show for me, (effort? The pop core? empty the popcorn?)
Now no squares allowed [because we're havin a ball]
We do it for the yay-high [and the ten feet tall]
Everybody [in the place] get up off the wall
[[We bout to take it all back, yes, yes y'all]]

[Asheru]
Have you ever been to your local venue to see a show that just ain't no good?
[I mean the bammer on stage, he rhyming nonsense nonstop and you wish he would]
So now you mad at your peoples for settin' you ass up and sayin' this was the place to be
[To make the situation worse your friend knew the artist so, nigga, you coulda got in free]
And just when you think you gotta head for the door and go back from whence you came
You see your boy getting put in a yoke, and first you think it's a joke
But then you know it ain't a game, when they say...

[Chorus]
I got an idea, that I wanna share
You don't like it, so what? I don't care
Throw your hands up, keep em in the air
Don't wanna roll with it, fuck up outta here!
We only rockin' for the live ones (right here!) [x2]</pre>
