BACKDRAFT!  We ain't tryin to make you cats laugh
So talk that, we stack cash (BLAST) how long will rap last
if it only had corny MC's
Arsonists settin fires three-sixty degrees, BACKDRAFT!

Who wanna start a trend, when it shouldn't even be a trend
to be reckoned with, I think too many MC's are forgettin
I gather your whole crew, pull your pupils out your nostrils
Bad, raise my staff like witchcraft, takin em out for talkin back

BACKDRAFT!  My arch enemies I'm fire fightin
	So if you think of takin us out
	your lucky ? expire you may retire
MC's get passed out like flyers, more dope rhymes than
	Scarface got coke lines
You couldn't jerk me if you soaked mine

You get broke nine, in ten different ways, start at your armpiece
	Then we continue
Plus I won't stop til your whole frame is deceased

Aiyyo man all your firestations cause these rappers burn through molecules
It's possible rockin you from your pores to your follicles
	Droppin true skills (WORLDWIDE)
We rip it unrestricted, my ends terrific
Label this here, a pyroglyphic

Got you addicted now you wanna get (high) but you ain't takin flight
And since you're out, sleepin, sweet dreams, cause we be breakin night
	Creatin tight songs
One style, is never necessary
I'm magnificent, better word, would be extrodinary

We toured through every fort and many thought we couldn't motivate

So hold your weight, ain't nuttin personal, it's just your flow we hate

Four-five, ? off, like inferanl
Damn it's he that makes the minimals that's now bein depleted
How you sounded is repeated, witcha ? rap that flows to see the
rhymin as the planet soul of providence..

So what so MC's know that I go nuts cause I bring hernia pain
Female MC's always treat me like a vericose vein
	Cause they don't want it
Plain and simple I break it down like enzymes
and still got lyrical microbiologists decodin my rhymes
DNA structure

Flucuate, great dictation with them
cross and fadin's and them Krylon illustrations
We'll head out, it's amazin what be comin out the projects
like suburban families, cleanin out they hallway closets

Deposit right into sockets of wannabe model prophets
And I curse if you don't jock it, I'm stop you doo doo poppin
You floppin you coppin please, ease up to be the sharpest
Got you suckers on deez, external my ? is slobbin

BACKDRAFT!  Burning all those, who wannabe copycatters
	That's right
Trying to score runs on a slam, but they sloppy batters
Your rhyme bein chopped ? when you're surrounded by lyricists
I keep my flow difficult, so they're puzzled, when they be hearin this

I rock it now, so reminisce later, check your data then skate a
search around the world like the equator
So get your BluBlocker my knocka, the sun is here to shine
Swingin a Bat-man, and Rob-in those that are fine

BACKDRAFT!  Engine engine number seventeen
Mic the gasoline to pass the team and lead us to the finish line
On a domination tip, cause you tried livin mine
Give it time

When you get sprayed with muderous rhymes
	I burn the world
Like rims on cars, rooftoppin with Tupac
My havoc jam traffic leavin thoughts gridlocked, for two blocks
For twenty-two blocks, stomp a mile in those shoes
I step in walkin on lava, and STILL runnin through crews

	Bashin crews and fools
Get summoned to hear my sermon
Servin love slaves, til the mind blur flutter flows, the giz be squirtin
merchants with the force of my mathematics advatange
Too drastic, it's flowin enormous like the ?

BACKDRAFT!  MC's try to mess with deez
Talk they yack around my farm and shakin up my trees
Human please, I sneeze on your props and cheese
It's the dirty rat's trap with raps that ease

	Pussycats leave!
With coordination like masturbation
Givin birth to styles and flows, with artificial insemination
Crew penetration, I make you climax
You see me, comin in 3-D, like you in Imax

Now this be rated PG, for Perfect Grammar I be sentencin
Street speakin, incredible heat-seakin
Disintegratin rap groups in high priced attired (AHH)
Extinguisher, fireman now puttin out the fire
We takes it higher
