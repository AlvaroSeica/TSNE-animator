[CHORUS]
It's a serious thing to hail up the king
It's a serious thing strive to live clean
It's a serious thing to fight the machines
It's a serious thing to know what life really means
It's a serious thing to hail up the king
It's a serious thing to link with a queen
It's a serious thing if you holding the green
Rastfari know what life really means

[Ras Ceylon]
Nyahbinghi thats the groundation one, two order 
now you feel the vibration ancient heartbeat basic
what the tracks been laced with chanting over drums 
in this firm meditation me and my idren facing
crucial situations my crew in different places stays
united on the basis of the same confrontations with a common enemy
thats why we keep the fire blazin create our own economy
a part of prophecy sparked by Marcus Garvey
who said look to the east because redemption is starting
with the crowning  of a black king Revelation still happening
conquering lion Jah Lives the earth is adapting
you would too if you knew what the beast would do to you
in a war for the mind and soul my music gets you through
to the other side of freedom please believe I see em
signs of the times be wise overstand the meaning

[CHORUS]
It's a serious thing to hail up the king
It's a serious thing strive to live clean
It's a serious thing to fight the machines
It's a serious thing to know what life really means
It's a serious thing to hail up the king
It's a serious thing to link with a queen
It's a serious thing if you holding the green
Rastfari know what life really means

[Ras Ceylon]
Locked up for the herb you aint heard
better watch where you burn because the laws concerened
bout your self medication healing of the nations
they fight the marijuana we deliver it to patients
proper treatments different places been growing for ages
but if you got more than an ounce you facing felony cases
trapped in cages like rats in mazes and thats outrageous
nonviolent crimes doing time on a daily basis
keep the ganja plan sacred no part to be wasted 
it comes from the earth but like life it can be taken

[CHORUS]
It's a serious thing to hail up the king
It's a serious thing strive to live clean
It's a serious thing to link with a queen
Rastafari know what life really means

[Ras Ceylon]
There's nothing on this earth like a virtuous woman
queen mother giving birth for generations to grow on
I hold strong to the love given from the feminine
the only thing Im addicted to is estrogen
but im committed to you like His Majesty to Empress Menen
balancing my life heart and feather on a pendulum
already my wife the first night was the ceremony 
matriarch matrimony divine her story
glory given to my sistren best friend and wisdom
for now we building a foundation for our children

[CHORUS]
It's a serious thing to hail up the king
It's a serious thing strive to live clean
It's a serious thing to fight the machines
It's a serious thing to know what life really means
It's a serious thing to hail up the king
It's a serious thing to link with a queen
It's a serious thing if you holding the green
Rastfari know what life really means</pre>
