I believe the children are our future

[ VERSE 1: Homeboy Sandman ]
Boy Sand is for the kids
Lil bro and lil sis smoking cigs, quit
Shouldn't you go study for a quiz
STD is not pronounced "stid"
Who produced this? 6th
Kids 'tween 3 and 6 shouldn't have to tussle with the three sixes
Watching big chested vixens 
Need to go and get they chest Vicksed
Little black girls, your hair is beautiful
You could leave it natural it's suitable
Forgive the adults that try to get you
To burn it, they've got self image issues
Turn off the TV and go to sleep
You're not a ugly duckling, you're a swan
I know you think that being different makes you weak
But being different makes you strong

This is for you

[ VERSE 2: Homeboy Sandman ]
Think before you speak
Wash your hands before you take a leak
Don't be cocky when you take the lead
If you cocky light a match before you leave
Brush your teeth
Stop and smell the flowers seeds
Enjoy the sun showers seeds
Deshell your sunflower seeds
Don't crack when sides is pulling you
'tween either going to math or cutting class and getting drunk
Don't let nobody bully you
Feels so much better having someone beat your ass than being a punk 
Say no to drugs
Never turn your back on your bruhs
The object of life ain't making bucks
The object of life is spreading love

This is for you

[ VERSE 3: Chace Infinite ]
I take the time to teach the kids in the streets
For the children, like Ason Unique
Little sisters, you ain't gotta be a freak
Even Nicki Minaj wasn't that at 13
Little brothers, you ain't gotta be a fool
And I know they don't teach us nothing useful in them schools
But, if you hustle then consider school a tool
That you use against the devil so he don't fool you
Uh, consider these jewels
For growth and development, guidelines and rules
The little homies need to know it ain't cool
To openly disrespect the people that made you
Love your parents no matter the consequences
Before you go to sleep, don't forget to wash the dishes
And say a prayer before you eat something
That's a blessing because somebody get to eat nothing

This is for you</pre>
