Song:   Dreamchaser
Typed by: @Daneo10

CHORUS - BROTHA J:
What we do is far from the ordinary
It's the extraordinary
Chasing our dreams 
'Til we make it a reality
There ain't no limit to how far we can go
We keep going
Chasing our dreams
Chasing our dreams...

DAN-E-O:
I've been called a "dreamchaser", hopes high like a free baser
Known as a bona fide wanna-be cream taster
Pause, a keen waster? Labels, it's mad bizarre
They won't pick me up, I'm the ugly bitch at the bar
Determined to keep music in a state that useless
And won't permit the ingredient of creative juices
Admit it, I hit it better than niggas snatching millions
Playing emotional baseball, I'm catching feelings
You think that crap's appealing? I got the world amazed
Talk sweet like I'm trying to convince a girl to blaze
Want rhymes? Got an absurd array
And I write thinking "what if it's the last thing they ever heard me say?"
This ain't an act, though I've played
A couple of delivery boys, you see the thing is Dan always brings it
The planet's asking "where's he sent from?"
And I won't stop 'til my outcome's a better income
So hands off of my jams, I awfully manslaughter
Protective over my music as if it's Dan's daughter
Haters recline like your seat's back
Follow this, hashtag eat a dick nigga, tweet that!

CHORUS - BROTHA J:
What we do is far from the ordinary
It's the extraordinary
Chasing our dreams 
'Til we make it a reality
There ain't no limit to how far we can go
We keep going
Chasing our dreams
Chasing our dreams...

CHARISMA A.K.A. SKIZZZ:
I've been called a dreamchaser, aim for the stars with a beam laser
Evasive from the fast life, got my drive, call me "Speed Racer"
Pause, for the cause, praise Allah
Murder mic terrorist I raise this bar 
To new heights, the brown Walter White, cooking that new dope
For you folks, take two tokes, leaving them fools broke
Skizzzy I'mma spew quotes, got 'em by the ample
Chop em' down like samples and I make them an example
With my skill set, build threat, leave them in a standstill
And get behind these bars like a vandal
And manhandle these beats with the heat, yet I never faced defeat
And fuck them swag boys in they tight pants and sandals
Get right back with hands full, fight back these damn fools
Looking like some wack ghouls, I come with the raw
I'm a wolf rockin' lamb's wool in a fuckin' camp full
Of highly trained assassins upper cuttin' your jaw
Stop my money, you get trampled, ambushed, van full
Of mother fuckers who don't really care for the law
Get you dismembered, dismantled, Alroy, Daniel
Indian, EspaÃ±ol, fuck who you are!

CHORUS (x2) - BROTHA J:
What we do is far from the ordinary
It's the extraordinary
Chasing our dreams 
'Til we make it a reality
There ain't no limit to how far we can go
We keep going
Chasing our dreams
Chasing our dreams...</pre>
