Song:   Drinkin' Blunts (Smokin' 40's)
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
Drinkin blunts, smokin 40's
Smokin 40's, drinkin blunts
That's what this kid does for fun
Pour some smoke into that cup

[mc chris]
Like this beat and how it bounces
Don't smoke trees, we smoke treehouses
Break them bushes, shred them shrubs
Can't match the passion well I match these nubs
Wreck them trees like Iron Giant
Taco Bell is where my time went
{Would you like a fiesta bowl?}
{Cristobol wants a siesta bowl}
Lowrider lighter cause it bounces up
Now roll that window like a basket bruh
Hey snickerin clown, put your licorice down
It's just like a joint, but it's bigger and brown
It's a blunt, but yo we don't smoke them
We soak them with our 40's open
Actin loopy in our hooptie
Sippin on our doobie smoothies!
(That's right y'all... smoothies with weed in them)

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
40 shorty, suck a titty
It ain't pretty in Cloud City
Billy Dee and 45
Pour that shit and watch it rise
Christopher B is sayin' "What's in this?"
Christopher Lee is drinkin Old English
Budwiser, St. Ides
MGD and a Billy Valentines
Turn it counter clockwise, bring the weed if your holdin
Ain't heard me girl you put a shit in a cold one
Breathe that beer steam into your lungs
Bronchial tubes ain't never been drunk
Don't have a cow man, just get bent
Pour that beer, under that tent
Bub and barley, holy hops
Just like John Locke's lodge in +Lost+
If you leave then slam the flap
If you stay then twist a cap
Throw your weed up in the air
Pour your 40 in your shorts
If you do what mc say
Guess what homey? You're a dork

[Chorus]

{*noises from 1:53 to 2:13 partying*}
