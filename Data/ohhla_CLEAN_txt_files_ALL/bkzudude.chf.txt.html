[Chorus: 12 O'Clock]
We them Brooklyn dudes and we ride like the south
In the '76 deuce and a quarter, with the big mouth
Black suede sheets, white walls, so clean
Brooklyn Zu, my team look so mean
Ride dirty and we pulling on good green
Hold them things, shoot them things
See them Zu youth bang and we cock and aim
When we fire off the cannon, out the nose come flames

[Popa Chief]
If ya getting big money, rolling on better than 20's
Get the cake, eat the cake, own real estate
Independant woman looking good, no makeup
Hair, nails, tits is real, throw ya hands up
Formulate the plans and the warrior flawless
Stay focused, can't get careless
I taste success, the pound won't greet me
I got my eyes on 740, and a loft overlooking the city
Living large, sitting pretty, never tap out
I shakes them up well, never crap out
Mines is XL, and I ain't afraid to whip it out
The room gets dark as hell when I pull it out
Fire in the hole, I hope you brought back up
This is the run down, right now
Unlike the rock, I hold the flame
I'm putting hot lyrics inside your brain

[Chorus]</pre>
