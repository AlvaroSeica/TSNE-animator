[ VERSE 1 ]
[ Lord Tariq ]
And on the seventh day the Lord made money
On the sixth day I busted my gun
500,000 is a half of one
Caught the ki's on consigment for 63 hundred
On sale but only for Bronx niggas cause we want it
Gone head-up with the connect just to gain my respect
With the game that I shot througout the plains of the US
Made a claim to this, which is to kill or get killed
So why carry if you leave it concealed? For real
[ Peter Gunz ]
When I caught my gun charge, a felony
Niggas was tellin me, Gunz instead of totin guns
You should rhyme about guns
Instead of bustin guns, nigga, get funds
And let these niggas know you be the one
So I went from Rikers Isle to Coxsackie
Wrote letters with plans, you never got at me
You put a block on your phone so I'd never call
But I knew one day I'll be home to ball
And watch you niggas fall
[ Lord Tariq ]
Yo, me and Peter Gunz move in silence, our footsteps discrete
On blocks to backstreets where the murders meet
This fast money keeps a nigga standin firm on his feet
And best believe that we playin for keeps; meet
The Lord Tariq and PG, nigga, ain't nothin happenin
Silver Benz, silver B's, my cars matchin the platinum
You think cause you a star it can't happen
We can put down the mics, pick up the guns and get to clappin
What

[ CHORUS 2x ]
You got one life to live, one gun to bust
One nigga to save, one nigga to rush
It's all about sex, money, life or death
You gotta make a choice, is it right or left?

[ VERSE 2 ]
[ Peter Gunz ]
On 174th I learned the real meaning of bustin that motherfuckin gun up
Case a nigga run up, leave a nigga done up, dark to sun up
Be ready to flee
Yo Lord, tell em where you be
[ Lord Tariq ]
Catch me in the Bronx on Cozy surrounded by thug niggas
No-love-niggas, peel-a-nigga-rug-nigga, what nigga?
Feel a nigga out first avoidin bug niggas
Breakin bread with some big name drug niggas
Cause it's in my blood, nigga what
Deal goin down the park, I want a cut, or get cut the fuck up
A niggas lust to bust guns the way a nigga bust nuts
Nigga trust none but bust guns for trust funds
So if you ever need a nigga, beep me, 911
And watch how quick a nigga come to leave another nigga numb
I'm from Soundview projects where all my niggas from
And Uptown it's disrespect to call another nigga son
[ Peter Gunz ]
Peter Gunz, you know my friends say I'm sane, some say I'm off
Label me Roc-A-Fella cause I'm hot like Sauce
I want a Testarossa but I settle for a Porsche
Shit, you ask me why, well that motherfucker cost
Greenbacks, it's time to lean back and set the road
And enjoy the money from this music shit I sold
This rap shit is platinum? Well that other shit is gold
But it seem money-wise that other shit got it sewn

[ CHORUS 2x ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
[ Lord Tariq ]
Yo Gunz, I know there's a lot of niggas schemin now
Cause they heard that we got it
[ Peter Gunz ]
I got nothin but clips for niggas lookin at my pockets
Consider your life equivalent to the shit on my wrist
[ Lord Tariq ]
And while we squeezin you can think about this
(Peter Gunz)
Nigga, six shots to the chest
[ Lord Tariq ]
The other 10 to yo head
So even if you got yo vest, you face the color of dead
[ Peter Gunz ]
These Bronx niggas born and bred and if you creep you can get it
But keep in mind when you walk, you gots to take these bullets with it
[ Lord Tariq ]
Like blaouw!
Y'all niggas know the deal now, I'm foul
I do a killing with a smile
[ Peter Gunz ]
So how the fuck you gonna rumble with the biggest niggas
With the biggest triggers that's countin figures 
And steady blastin on you bitch niggas
[ Lord Tariq ]
It be the Bronx, nigga, borough of kidnappers and rappers
( ? ) and break bread with the crackers
[ Peter Gunz ]
See it's like plain and simple, the kings of the temple
We the first one to bust you like a pimple
Motherfucker
