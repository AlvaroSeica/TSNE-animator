(nice and easy)
It's a California Cruiser
(nice and easy)
Yeeeaaah
(nice and easy)
It's a California Cruiser
(nice and easy)
Yeeah

(Rodney O)
Yeah
This is a California Cruiser
Givin you somethin that you're not used ta
I won't talk about a girl 'cause that's played out
I wanna give you somethin to talk about
So I said we got to make a cut that's mellow
Called up Joe on the phone he answered 'hello?'
Hey loc, we need somethin hard but smoothed out
You got that Joe? -and he said:'without a doubt!'
Scoop you up in a hour, later bro'
Have the track on a tape but you don't hear me tho'
You've been fiendin for a jam like this one
Rodney O and Joe got the cut that's goin on
Fill up the tank, it's time to cruise the Boulevard
You're checkin out the paint jobs on peoples' cars
It ain't like it used to be 4 years ago
It seems everyone's rollin all the 'renzos

(Joe Cooley)
Straight cruisin
Don't front, we know you like to do it
Spent about eight G's or more to try to rule it
Everybody can't wait for the weekends
Fresh hair cuts, now they out there frontin
Straight to the car wash on Crenshaw
At the 5 o' clock, it's nuthin but a Mardi Gras
Fellas out there clownin on the hoochies
Tryin to set it up so they can get the coochie
They use they funky fresh car that try to help 'em out
In '92 man, yeah you gotta have clout
Women try to play hard on the Okie-doke
You're not fly, they not rollin down the windows
It ain't a thang man, mob to the next set
Hit the freeway, y'all is kinda jet
Sit back and put the car on cruise control
Turn up the volume so you can hear the music flow

(nice and easy)
It's a California Cruiser
(nice and easy)
Yeeeaaah
(nice and easy)
It's a California Cruiser
(nice and easy)
Yeeah

(Rodney O)
Cali Cruiser is a song that we had to make
No singing on the track 'cause that would be fake
Who ever said that our rap can't be smooth as Silk
Who ever did needs to have they cap peeled
Rodney O and Joe Cooley with a smooth cut
Roll down the windows, there's no need to have 'em up
I'm gonna pass it on to my boy Joe Cooley
Go ahead and show 'em how cool you can be

(Joe Cooley)
Smooth
Somethin mellow you can chill to
Cruisin thru the neighbourhood with nuthin else to do
It don't matter it's ?neither? all occasions
Keep it turned up when you're at the gas station
So get your gas and hop right back into your ride
Rewind the tape and start it again because it's real fly
We broke you off somethin funky that will rap ya
We're not frontin on the California Cruiser
