[Chorus]
Imma bust her in my new car
Uh in da backseat
In da backseat
In da backseat
Imma bust her in my new car
Uh in da backseat
In da backseat
In da backseat

[Verse 1 - Stunna]
Cummon baby hop inside stunna got a new ride
Candy on da outside leather on da inside
We aint gotta get a room yeah them seats brand new
Baby can you ride a stick I gotta hemi in my shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Lil Uno]
In da backseat lets make it happen
Freak me nasty dont use magnums only gold wrappas
Lets switch gears hold on slow let a real nigga hit
No seatbelts all tickets she ride fast so all hands no hips
Love a hair puller skin on leather master strapper scream like thunder

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Lil B]

Go down eat that choke her now she freeze that
I beat it up when she came my little balls steamin

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 - Young L]
She know who I are I'm feenin to bust those in the car
She got my dick on hard boppa neck go through your jaw
But she suck a mean one to the back in the seat huh
Magic get a hand gun
