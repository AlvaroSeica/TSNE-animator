[Young Mav]		
We're here to hold summer for ransom
So put your hands up for a brand new anthem
Let it spread like gossip, from June to August
Strictly heat this summer my dear, I promise
In the same vein as Chi and Slingshot
A snapshot, of the joys of have-nots
I know bouncers gon' stress, cause the way that we dress
Who wears a suit and tie when it's 35?
This is the life for those with less cheese
Throw a Block-O, barricade the streets
I wanna hear new tunes straight from JA
Not the same three songs that they play all day
Paint a vision, the sound system
Got speakers so big my fam could live in'em
And chicks is so thick from rice and peas
That the movements of their hips keep callin me
	
[Chorus  Oozeela  1X]
From where we come
We respect our roots
From where we come
We bring up the ghetto youth
From where we come
Our motto is the truth
It comes from the veins and the arteries 
Blood of wi families
Come! 
We get it from where we from 
Our Vibes
We get it from where we from 
Our Style
It comes from di veins and the arteries 
Blood of we families

[Dirt Gritie]		
Boom bye, bye in a rude boy head
Test the soundman, and your squad gon dead
Messin' with my crew something you gon dread
Judging the jury your career gon end
En, En, En, En, End
Gwan with yourself mi no care what you say
I'm deep in these streets matter fact got it paid
You wanna play fool boy stay in your lane
You wanna act chicken but the God don't stray
Focused on my goals getting money all day
Day, Duh, duh, Day, Day, Day
24-7, 358
Take a week off just to lamp and play
Sippin' on crown smoking weed getting laid
Don't be jelly cause I'm dripping with style
You haters grab a coke and a smile

[Chorus  Oozeela  1X]
From where we come
We respect our roots
From where we come
We bring up the ghetto youth
From where we come
Our motto is the truth
It comes from the veins and the arteries 
Blood of wi families
Come! 
We get it from where we from 
Our Vibes
We get it from where we from 
Our Style
It comes from di veins and the arteries 
Blood of we families

[Bridge  Oozeela  1X]
Dem a wanting
More music them a hunting
Politic Live a gi dem something
This is Music For Mavericks
Far from the average

[Bigga Nolte] 		
Baby girl, who can rock it like we?
Step in a di place and rock the party
Go ahead if you want drink Bacardi
But the Appleton Rum gon' do it for me
Now I'm feeling little tipsy
Find a nice girl to come and tempt me
Cock her body just like a shotty
I need a bad girl that means a hottie
Now you wanna smoke some trees
I got that tai chi, that make she irie
In this fantasy you get what you need
All you got to do is just come with me
And I know you wanna roll with us
Got a big black truck so you roll with us
And the way that we sound they ain't holdin' us
And now that were here they gon go with us

[Chorus  Oozeela  1X]
From where we come
We respect our roots
From where we come
We bring up the ghetto youth
From where we come
Our motto is the truth
It comes from the veins and the arteries 
Blood of wi families
Come! 
We get it from where we from 
Our Vibes
We get it from where we from 
Our Style
It comes from di veins and the arteries 
Blood of we families</pre>
