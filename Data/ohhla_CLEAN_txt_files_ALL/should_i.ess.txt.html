Verse one

Should I show you how I feel nah
Coz the best reaction is the action
Never mind about that
It was just a way, that I was suppose to start this beat
Rhyme Essence MC on a solo tip
As I bake em biscuits for the devil
Deceptions, anger, manipulations, reigning in peoples' minds
How can we be dreaming to leave in a peaceful world
When we ourselves are the devil
God's angels, failing to penetrate, the Babylon walls that we create in our hearts
Freedom of expression no longer exists
Fear in our minds
Courage overshadowed by gold and silver
Large lumps of bread, stuck on peoples' throats
Decisions, compromised by selfish felons
Hunger in their minds
Making it real hard for us
So how can we show you how we feel

Verse two

Manipulation of Djs to enjoy air play of whack tracks
My genius thoughts turned as trash
Propaganda, evil plots, cheats is taking over in our society
Rescue on the way, I doubt it, coz that's what keeps our world go round
Give it shot and try, to see the reason why
Why all these nightmares, are turning to be real
Think over and seek help
The help that will never be
The devil in form of money, ruling the world from the back door
Lucifer reigns in our midst
Reckoning the good old days, when corruption was just a word from the dictionary
Now it's a word, for evil missionaries
The last of the dying bleed, won't die, until pain and suffering seize to exist
Clear sober minds, replacing corrupt battalion of evil thoughts
Light replacing darkness, letting the righteous rule again
But that's just a dream, until them, I will show you how I feel</pre>
