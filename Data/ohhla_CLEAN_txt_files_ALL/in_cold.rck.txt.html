[Intro]
Run with me or run from me
Pussies don't get pussy
Yeah

[Verse One]
I murdered all of my foes, contract killing
Twenty K will get ya grandmammy pinned to the ceiling
Midst of the war, I piss on graves
Kids get grazed by my piss poor ways
Never could imagine it, living with paralysis
Shoulda checked ya rearview, made a better analysis
Wack yayo caught him slippin while he snort dust
Cold blood, bullet hit him like a tour bus
Check the time on my Movado, my jazzy bitch a mulatto
who thinks it's petty to model
Suede Louis on my feet, still runnin the street
And I never missed a heartbeat

[Chorus]
Family over the money, money over the bitches
Money don't mean nothin, then why they callin it riches
I'm addicted to watches, Mama tellin me stop it
Got one over 50, 50 you better watch it

[Verse Two]
Do him in cold blood
Look him in his eyes, may do him with no gloves
Beat the case like Orenthal
Above the law, it's so hard to pin the big dog
Live on so I still bark
In my earliest convenience Imma kill y'all
Make a lil cake, haters wanna envy
God wanna see you niggaz in a bentley

[Chorus]
Family over the money, money over the bitches
Money don't mean nothin, then why they callin it riches
I'm addicted to watches, Mama tellin me stop it
Got one over 50 and keep 50 in my pocket

[Verse Three]
Limousines for the don, number three is the charm
Flee red carpet, chillin E on my arm
Purple rain, smokin head smokin weed, call it "purple brain"
I'm in the purple label, daddy got a purple heart
Not in the service but I'm swervin in a purple car
Once the bitch need a oil change
I go and buy a new one cause I'm spoiled mayne

[Chorus]
Family over the money, money over the bitches
Money don't mean nothin, then why they callin it riches
I'm addicted to watches, Mama tellin me stop it
You know I'm totin the rocket so don't make a nigga pop it</pre>
