[Intro: DJ Crazy Toones Talking]
just throw your set high on the air
swear it's gettin' mighty funky out there
there's some bitches over here, there's some niggaz over there
can I get a ride on cous' "yeah"
ha ha ha ha ha, this is dedicated to the whole.."Suckers" "Suckers"

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I take flight like fist fights
you see bright lights, throwin' lefts and rights
I keep my jaw light tight swingin'
bullets seein' pass your head though your windows
and plastic falls, it's rat cast get closed (*laughter*)
I laugh at those who chose to get ball
when they loose a couple of souls, they crumbled and fall
done watch the hunt down hurt, hang and hate the hater
watch how we rise, ball and fake be later
top dollar, anybody who got a problem with us
could easly be found in crush (*Gun Cocked*)
our lush fillin' of rush, feel the Adrenaline pumpin'
me and Dub and the Escalade dumpin' "yeah"
Crazy Toones productions, cra.. the ass (*car peels out)
Limo tint down, let us track some tramps my nigga
when I walk I'm leavin' holes in the concrete
Xzibit dropped that heat from thirty thousand feet.....

[Chorus: W.C.]
nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
pull the trigger, give it up
lift the Chevy, grill up
nigga what, if you a crib or a blood
nigga I don't give a fuck, let me see them fingers up

nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
pull that trigger, give it up
lift the Chevy, grill up
nigga what, got me throwin' up my Dubs
through that nigga cuttin' it up, Toones is fuckin' it up

[Verse 2: Young Maylay]
let me explain it, how I let the three wheel swingin'
drop it side to side, lock it up and then bang it
that's right, westcoast, L.A. originated
the pirate'll take flight, now I'm the pilot desingated
Maylay cocked fist sittin' "what" switch hittin'
hundred spoke twistin', five twenty stip grippin'
see the bottom of the transmission, sixtey six inchin'
showin' off how to quote it in Chrome suspension
get my crown home, my bounce on
cut the sounds on and stompin' like Bow Wow
they already known I got the hottest rider goin'
flat bed in the back, just incase I gotta tore them
I cause I sure give it up, let me catch them with that wheels stuck
jumpin' out soundin' like Dub, yeah nigga what
two licks on the switch, and they got up "bang bang"
with the ass in locked up, that mothafucker hot hop....

[Chorus: W.C.]
nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
pull the trigger, give it up
lift the Chevy, grill up
nigga what, if you a crib or a blood
nigga I don't give a fuck, let me see them fingers up

nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
pull that trigger, give it up
lift the Chevy, grill up
nigga what, got me throwin' up my Dubs
through that nigga cuttin' it up, Toones is fuckin' it up

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
who is it, the black nigga with the big dick
toss it up with Crazy Toones takin' your trick
but that bitch better swallow
I don't give a damn if she has fake ass rap model "Damn"
nigga get the fuck out here "while below me down"
if she sucked my balls, if she want me to stink
I don't give a fuck I'm filled with curse words "come on"
fuck all your Radio gigs and nerds
and fuck the....my black ass still gon eat
Airplay they can't stop the Villain "uha"
slangin' Mixtapes like my fuckin' ass dope dealin' "what you need"
take a flight with Dub and X "nigga"
let me foot print like the mothafuckin' tea-Rex "damn"
who got next, we run the court
and pregnant your bitch while you pay the child support "Mark"
then I'm out, get the next tape "uha"
the Villainous make your punk ass can't wait, ugh....

[Chorus: W.C.]
nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
pull the trigger, give it up
lift the Chevy, grill up
nigga what, if you a crib or a blood
nigga I don't give a fuck, let me see them fingers up

nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
pull that trigger, give it up
lift the Chevy, grill up
nigga what, got me throwin' up my Dubs
through that nigga cuttin' it up, Toones is fuckin' it up

[Verse 4: W.C.]
Knick knackin' police rollin' in the Patty wagon
push it through the alley askin' where Dub and Toones at..and
where them niggaz livin'?, and how them niggaz steal stack?
is it really true them niggaz grew up on that house
niggaz sit and chat, talk behind the loc's back
but when we come through, like what's happenin' they don't want no action
little faggots, ya'll don't want it, cause we're pistol packin'
and you know the Childhood brothers won't get to gatin'
Click clackin', pass the cushion and zig-zag
dip that let that mothafucker get back
rip that 9 millimeter, clip gat
bust a U where these niggaz at?
let's push that wig back nigga
Toones and Dub-C back to slaughter and shit
switch tapes, Mixtapes yeah we started this shit
find me some real niggaz y'all can feel niggaz
to all my ground converse and Chevy Grill Lexus....

[Chorus: W.C.]
nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
pull the trigger, give it up
lift the Chevy, grill up
nigga what, if you a crib or a blood
nigga I don't give a fuck, let me see them fingers up

nigga what, roll up on them, hit them up
pull that trigger, give it up
lift the Chevy, grill up
nigga what, got me throwin' up my Dubs
through that nigga cuttin' it up, Toones is fuckin' it up

[Outro: DJ Crazy Toones Talking]
yeah, I wanna piss on all y'all nigga's graves before I kill you
Cause I'm tired of niggaz claimin' the westcoast
and ain't playin' no mothafuckin' the westcoast arts
no doubt about it, that's some bullshit</pre>
