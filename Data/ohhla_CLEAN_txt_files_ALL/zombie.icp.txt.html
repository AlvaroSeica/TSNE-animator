Wake the dead
Wake the dead
Wake the dead up
Wake the dead
Wake the dead
Wake the dead
Wake the dead up
Wake the dead

Get up!
Rest in peace!?
WHAT!? (Zombie Slide)
Fuck that!
Jump with the boom! (Zombie)
Rest in pandemonium bitch! (Slide)
Get up!
In fact, don't even rest! (Zombie Slide)
Get the fuck up and bust something sweet!
Jump with the bang!
Wake them dead ass feet!

When I die, it's time to celebrate
All love, escape the hella hate
First thing Imma do is start rocking
In the casket, pop locking
Dirt, dust, chipping away the rust
With these freaky moves that I bust
Imma pop out, rock out with my cock out
Monster Mash all across the grass
Fandango on the top of tombstones
Wake up them pile of bones
Foot Float right up out the graveyard
In the street, Crab Walking, way hard
Cars stop, what the fuck is going on!?
Dead bodies dancing on the lawn
Do the Sprinkler, do the Superman
Get stoopid, that's the plan

Get up!
Jump with the boom!
Zombie Slide up out your tomb
Can you fuck it up like us? (Zombie)
Can you freak the moves that we bust? (Slide)
Get up!
Jump with the bang!
Zombie Slide and do your thang!
Can you fuck it up like us? (Zombie)
Can you freak the moves that we bust? (Slide)

When I die, please don't cry any (why?)
Cuz I'm popping up and doing the Shimmy
Fuck heaven and hell, they can both wait
I'm getting live, freaking the snake
My left eyeball hangs outta my face
When I'm Krumping at a murderous pace
Police shooting at me, I bust the Hitchhike
I break it down any way you like
You don't even know what the fuck is going on
(What they call that?) I'm mowing the lawn
Ya wanna pop me, try to drop me
Backspin into a kickstand, they can't stop me
Look at me fucking up Air Guitar
That they shit, so there you are
We live forever, so there you go
J-U-Double G-A-L-O

Get up!
Jump with the boom!
Zombie Slide up out your tomb
Can you fuck it up like us? (Zombie)
Can you freak the moves that we bust? (Slide)
Get up!
Jump with the bang!
Zombie Slide and do your thang!
Can you fuck it up like us? (Zombie)
Can you freak the moves that we bust? (Slide)

Wake the dead
Wake the dead
Wake the dead up
Wake the dead

Come on!

Get up!
Jump with the boom!
Zombie Slide up out your tomb
Can you fuck it up like us? (Zombie)
Can you freak the moves that we bust? (Slide)
Get up!
Jump with the bang!
Zombie Slide and do your thang!
Can you fuck it up like us? (Zombie)
Can you freak the moves that we bust? (Slide)</pre>
