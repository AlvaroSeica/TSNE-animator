[Pastor Jeremiah Wright]
What Malcolm X said, when he got
silenced by Elijah Muhammad was in fact true
America's chickens, are coming home, to roost!
We took this country, by terror
Away from the Sioux, the Apache, the Arawak, the Comanche
The Arapaho, the Navajo, TERRORISM~!
We took Africans from their country to build our way of ease
and kept them enslaved, and living in fear
Terrorism! We bombed Grenada and killed innocent civilians
Babies, non-military personnel
We bombed the black civilian community of Panama
with stealth bombers and killed, unarmed teenagers and toddlers
Pregnant mothers and hard working fathers
We bombed Qadhafi's home and killed his child
We bombed Iraq!
We killed unarmed civilians, trying to make a living
We bombed a plant in the Sudan, to pay back, for the attack on our embassy
Killed hundreds of hard working people
Mothers and fathers, who left home to go that day
Not knowing that they'd never get back home
We bombed Hiroshima~! We bombed Nagasaki~!
And we bombed far more than the thousands in New York, and the Pentagon
and we never batted an eye
Kids playing in the playground
Mothers, picking up children after school
Civilians, not soldiers, people just trying to make it day by day
We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians
and black South Africans, AND NOW WE ARE INDIGNANT!
Because the stuff we have done overseas
is now brought right back into our own front yards!
America's CHICKENS, are coming home, to roost
