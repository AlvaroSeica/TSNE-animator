Savage on the beat
When you listen, you got to pay attention
And pay attention, got to listen

Let me tell you a little something about me
DCF 31st EZT
I can't stand a old pussy ass (), especially ratting ass pussy ass ()
Transform to super nussie, rob a bitch
Building houses with them other niggas bricks
the last straw, so now it's time to knock your ass off
Sneak attack, try my best to knock your back off
I talk shit bitch, because that's what I do
Hiding in yards, playing Peekaboo
You know the routine, not gimmicks
I tried to change but I guess it's just in me
Lortab and xanax bar
Lortab and xanax bar
Bitch niggas can't stand me
everybody eats, I keep it trill with my family

I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing

Nussie gots to go (what?!)
nussie gots to go (what?!)
That boy acting bad, he gon' ruin us for sure
I'm a gangster times ten everyday
Riding around town, bumping Morisday
In '89 I was slinging powder packs
scored an oz and i paid a stack for that
7grams 250-300
drought season, head first slinging dummys
gold teeth with the champaigne glass
(), call me anything but broke
bad bitches with the jerrycurl juice
In her ear she bust a new orleans hoops
go to jail and your partner make your bail
wasn't no such thing as, 'I'mma tell'
if you ratted, you die the same day
pull off with my pack, you die the same day

I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing

Parish prison, been there, done that
I'd rather that, than that black cadillac
I gives a fuck what you say about me
Because I'll make you shit in ()
I'm different
aint nobody like me
aint nobody like me
DCF, ceo and the audience
Got plenty sense, but sometimes I get retarded
and ball like the man
Don't show me shit, because I'll call Diablo to double back and hit the lick
Call me mister Really be Doing Them Things
Really be jacking, really be () them great big ol things
I told you pay attention when you listen
and when you listen, pay attention
I hear you pimping, you paid, you straight
Yeah, I know him, he real... fake

I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
I don't believe you bitch 'till you kill something
You all bluffing we busting, the scores 5-nothing</pre>
