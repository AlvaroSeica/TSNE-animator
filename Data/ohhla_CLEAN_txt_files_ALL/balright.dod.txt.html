(Verse 1, N.A.R.D)
Look in the heart in the ghetto, where we be shooked up
From black losin' their life, now everytime we look up
Finally pop him, throw away, just learn, they wanna book us
Chicago political criminals like a crook Church
To the Al Capone city we love so much
But when we give our love way, now who the fuck gon' love us?
We die young, and they don't care
But the old folks still lookin' for they Medicare
And it's somethin' on my mind I gotta tell ya
My people who surronded me, they thought I was a failure
But I, appear to be that nigga from the start
Cause I'm down for my motherfuckin' niggas in my heart

(Hook, Johnny P)
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for me
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for meee

(Verse 2, AK)
Guns blastin', they after me
Like an assassin, neighborhood not lastin'
They burn it down, like fuck them bastards
Police be watchin', from the other block and
They crucial, put the car in neutral
They try to school, people don't run jokes
Different day, same shit, so I hustle wit' my head up
Get'cha paper, what'chu scared of?
I ain't no joke so, put the jokes up in a choke hold
My children need, don't stay so
New shoes and some nice clothes
I guess is what we fight fo'
Children of the ghetto, reach for the stars
Never think to me-sss, cause you know who you are

(Johnny P)
Why don't you hoold yo' head up
Fooor meeee

(AK)
This what I said to him

(Hook)
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for me
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for meee

(Verse 3, Belo)
I was a hustla as a shorty, had to make it pop off
Nigga gave me lip and he flinched, I knocked his socks off
Fuck paddle, bubble the coke, and watch it rock off
White man designed a blue-print, to clear the block off
The snakes always fill up the plate, and niggas fed up
We need to catch they ass in the yard, and shake they head up
Ya sista always struggles wit' babies, just keep ya head up
And brothas in the pen doin' time, don't ever let up
A motherfucka know what it is, to have to strive again
That's why we hit the bricks and shoot shit, when this go bobblin'
We tat the dead off in our skin, to keep the mob within'
I never wanna have to go rob, or have to starve again

(Hook)
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for me (Ric Jilla: Yeah)
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for meee

(Ric Jilla)
Baby it's gon' be alright
Homie it's gon' be alright
Hold yo head up
Baby it's gon' be alright
Homie it's gon' be alright

(Verse 4, Ric Jilla)
You only get "One Life to Live", and these ain't no soaps
Ain't no joke, nowadays it ain't no hope
An opportunity for you and me to follow our dreams
But me and my team, finally plan a powerful scheme
So we can try to make a way, that's why I take it "One Day"
At a time, I write rhymes, and get out here on the grind
Cause man, it's Do or Die for you and I, out here in the struggle
It's gon' be alright, nigga be about yo hustle
We almost, here now, we can't stop here
We ain't gon' quit til' we get everything they got here
Cause I know how it feel, to not to have your bread up
But even though you fed up, my nigga keep yo head up

(Hook)
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for me
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for meee

Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for me
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for meee</pre>
