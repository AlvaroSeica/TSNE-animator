Ah yeah, I like the way that sound
Yo Peaches, kick it over here

(Sisters)
(Sisters, I don't know what this world is comin to)

[ MC Peaches (&amp; Milk Dee) ]
This girl, Jo Ann (She was a video hoe, and)
She'd suck a toe to be in a video, man
(Word? Straight up, P?) No shit, Dee
She'll do a split to get on MTV
(Huh, that's not good, yo) You know that I know
(So you need to go, talk to the silly hoe)
Yo, I would if I could (Yeah) I should have a chance ta
(Aha?) But anyway, she said she's a dancer
(But-but does she dance, though?) They say hell no!
She likes to bend for the guys in the video
(She smiles and bends) She bends and smiles
(But the hooker's gettin laid like bathroom towels)
Sisters, don't go out like that
(Sisters) because you're better than that
Be like the P and let me hear you say
(Sisters) keep it in your pants, tucked away
(Sisters)
Please sisters, don't go out like that
(Sisters, I don't know what this world is comin to)
Please sisters, don't go out like that</pre>
