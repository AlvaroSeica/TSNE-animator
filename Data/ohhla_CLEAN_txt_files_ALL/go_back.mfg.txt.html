[Grimm, Verse 1]
They tortured all my ancestors
Hung them by the neck
They sit back and they laugh at us
Race with no respect
We helped build this whole country
Brick by brick
They don't treat us like human beings
Animals that's sick
It's not water that's making mud
The flowers are crying
The soil saturates with our blood
Brother and sisters are dying
Forty acres and a mule
Land was promised
Forty lashes whipped so cruel
Kunta Kinte is astonished
For so long we slaved this earth
But when time to get what's deserved
You didn't read the fine print
They said forget what we said before
Nothing is written in stone
We don't need your kind no more
This is not your home

[Chorus]
Go back to Africa
They say go back to Africa
They say go back to Africa
They say go back to Africa
They say go back to Africa
They say go back to Africa
They say go back to Africa
They say go back to Africa

[Verse 2]
It's hard to understand the men
What make 'em tick?
Who sin because they hate my skin
To be the burden we were picked
A white rose is what is chose
Law of the land
A red one is still a rose
The creator made them both
In our yards they burn a cross
Live at the barbecue
Saying, nigga you get lost
Next time it'll be you
Pack your stuff, be out of here
We don't want you here building
Where you go we just don't care
Just take them nappy headed children
Matter of fact we take that back
Our words we devour
You should go where it's all black
Cause here you have no power
You don't deserve privileges
We don't think that's you're a man
You're nothing but savages
How can I make you understand?
Nigga!

[Chorus x2]

[Voice sample from a Godzilla movie]
Well they really made a mess of this place</pre>
