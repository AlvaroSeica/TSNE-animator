[P.O.S.]
Ye-ye-ye-yeah, yeah, ye-ye-yeah
Don't let 'em tell you what you think is cool
Don't let 'em tell you what you think is right
Don't let 'em tell you what you think you should do
Then I'ma sleep at night, which is easy y'all

[Chorus]
Do you recognize when the world won't stop for you
Or when your days don't care what you got to do
Or when your weight's too tough to lift up, what do you do?
They don't choose for you, don't let 'em choose
Recognize when the world won't stop for you
Or when your days don't care what you got to do
Or when your weight's too tough to lift up, what do you do?
Don't let 'em choose for you, that's on you

[P.O.S.]
Yeah, another day, another dime, another state
Another mind, forty-eight moves to choose
But no matter the coast, we all toast the same PBR
So much settling for ours (what you drinking on)
There's so many lives and so many lines waiting
There's only so much time, so many die patient
So many skate only where the ice is thin
We too nice to not dive in right after them
We too right to not sway a little, wiggle from the path
Middle up, foot upon the gas, like the past
is the rear view, last laugh lands on the man
with the plan to do all that he can to do, all that he can
And we all save face in the face of our friends
And we all bend backwards to make amends
And we all take chances that change us
Civil with the self-hate just won't do

[Chorus]

[P.O.S.]
All right, a lot of my friends shake when they don't drink
All my friends wheeze in they sleep, all my friends think green
but can't afford to live it, can't ignore the cynics
Can't explore the gimmicks, can't report the dividends
Limited only by the need to stay fed
and giving up is like Latin, it's dead
It don't happen, don't even cross the head
Lost in our own web but it's our bed, sleep sucks
I mean, or least until I try, but at least until I'm right
But at least until I'm fly, let me get it on tight
But at least until it's mine, but at least until it's time
Let me set 'em up and knock 'em down, come on
But at least until I'm fine, but at least until I'm wrong
But at least until I got a piece to call my own
But at least until I'm grown, but at least until I'm gone
Say "Goodbye, goodbye"

[Chorus]

[P.O.S.]
And we all save face in the face of our friends
And we all bend backwards to make amends
And we all take chances that change us
Civil with the self-hate just won't do
Do you recognize when the world won't stop for you
Or when your days don't care what you got to do
Or when your weight's too tough to lift up, what do you do?
Don't let 'em choose for you, that's on you</pre>
