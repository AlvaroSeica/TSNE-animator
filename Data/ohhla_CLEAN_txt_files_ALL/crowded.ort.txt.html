Jeannie Ortega..
Papoose...
let me show y'all how its sposed to be done

[Jeannie Ortega]
don't get me started
It's getting kinda crowded in here
back up off me, I'm feeling like I'm suffocated
now here's my problem
I'm not gonna be your chick on the side
forget about it
You know damn well it wouldn't be right

[Chorus: Jeannie Ortega]
I dunno what you been thinkin bout me
did you think this was gonna be that easy?
hell no,you must be going crazy!
(noo-o-oo)Why don't you get outta my life
get outta my sight
get off oh my back...

Why don't you go back to ur world...
Go back to your girl..
I think you owe her...

I know whats going on
I wont be second to none(noo)

Back up, cuz you crowdin my space..
you need to get outta my face

[Verse 2]
lets be honest
I'm not the type of chick that you use..
and if you want it
if you want it
you'll have to choose
I've been thru this
I've been cheated on..
I know how it feels
Would I know that you wouldn't do the same to me

[Chorus: Jeannie Ortega]
I dunno what you been thinkin bout me
Did you think this was gonna be that easy?
Hell no,you must be going crazy!
(noo-o-oo)Why don't you get outta my life
get outta my sight
get off of my back...

why don't you go back to ur world...
go back to your girl..
I think you owe her...

I know whats going on
I wont be second to none(ohh noooo)

back up, cuz you crowdin my space..
you need to get outta my face

[Verse 3: Papoose]
Papoose...BK.B..uh..K...they say you can't have ur cake and eat it too..
tell me whats the meaning...
wats the sense of me having cake if I can't eat it
cheaters never win, my friend, you like creepin'
but hate when ure girl starts cheatin
imagine if you came home to your wife
opened your door and locked it
then you found rkelly hiding in ur closet
I knew you would start cheatin, before you even stopped it
I'm like when you double ur money, I'ma profit..
Albert einstein was smart, but im some wiser...
I'm a ladies man, your man is a womanizer
You gotta fite for love, can you make a fist
since your name is *Jeannie*, can I make a wish? (yeaahh)
no minor set backs, every move major
grown folk behaviour, jus do me one favor..
he put you on the side, let me be your savior..
crowded..
