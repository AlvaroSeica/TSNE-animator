[Intro]
Money coming in, money going out
Money coming in, money going out

[Verse 1]
Money coming in, money going out
If you ain't getting money take another route
Gun cock that nigga got a chopper that a chopper, tree down like timber
I'm a motherfuckin winner taking L's ain't in my repertoire
Unless you're tryina fill the air up with some medical
Man I've been getting money all week
And your girl is straight freak, I'll make her suck me straight to sleep
My life is like a party, wake up and get faded
Radical narly, man we party 'cause we made it
And I woke up in the club, fuck everybody
Streets with me and you're down to catch twelve bodies
I'm a different type of breed from these niggas
That's why all the bad bitches wanna see from a nigga
I just come to get my money and I leave all you niggas bitch
YMCMB on you niggas, uh

[Chorus]
Take a step back, dust my kicks off
Make your bitch jump like criss cross
Get my dick sucked, smearing up her lipgloss
Try to told you motherfuckers I'm a big dawg
Real nigga, I'm a big dawg
Real nigga, I'm a big dawg
Real nigga, I'm a big dawg
Big dawg, big dawg

[Verse 2]
Tryin to ball like a athlete nigga
Got money still fucking in my back seat nigga
Still running through these hoes like a track meet nigga
On fire already, can't match me nigga
I'm just doing me, you just sit and watch
I'm staring at your girl while she's staring at my watch
Counting money by myself, man I get lonely with the guap
So I hit the galleria with my homies, and we shop
Why you buy them hoes clothes? I buy them bitches rubbers
Fuck her to a coma, why you tell em ho you love em?
I am something like no other, you could call me Gudda
Trillest nigga walking and I put that on my mother

[Chorus]
Take a step back, dust my kicks off
Make your bitch jump like criss cross
Get my dick sucked, smearing up her lipgloss
Try to told you motherfuckers I'm a big dawg
Real nigga, I'm a big dawg
Real nigga, I'm a big dawg
Real nigga, I'm a big dawg
Big dawg, big dawg</pre>
