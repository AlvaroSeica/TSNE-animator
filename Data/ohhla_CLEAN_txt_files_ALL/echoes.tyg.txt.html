[unknown singer - in background]
The ceiling's falling in
Every time you don't know where you've been
Our love, seventeen to lifetime
The seasons change when we all stay the same
The pain I felt back then won't ever go away
Echoes call, me back to the feeling again {*3X*}

[Tyga - over singer]
At this point
I realize love is not an emotion I can neglect
My queen thought I wasn't ready for love - she was right
What did love mean to me?
It didn't mean anything
Compassion, affection
I just know I wanted it back
Can't be a king without love
Love...</pre>
