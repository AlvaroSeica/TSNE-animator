Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ay ay ay ay ay
Hurricane and they hay hay hay hatin
Go live intertainment
Yea yea ay was up and they hay hay hay hatin
ay ay ay ay this how I'm rockin ya heard meh

[Chorus]
Look at meh I got the pants to match my shirt
in the club watch I do the big merk
I'm off the chain and I am doin my thang [x7]
and watch me do the rick james

[Verse 1]
I got the pants to match my shirt
fall up in the club and watch me do the big merk
tell yo baby mama to stop callin
my blowin up my phone when u ain't home 
ay yo bed lay yo phone pocket full of green
black lac with the laptop screen
yea I got it in my ride
had to go to china jus get the rite kind
I hit the drink leanin to the left side
then I hit the bank jus to get to check signed
I hit the drink leanin to left side
then I hit the bank jus to get the check signed

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Pants that I got from pakistan
so exspensive that they see me in the club
there go hurricane everybody wanna see me
do the rick james so I do the rick james
hold up my chain people stoppin jus to see
watch me do my thing boppers boppin
but they kno I ain't lame I got game
plus I been makein change I bang
popin at yo brain flammable like propane [x2]
it's goin down so pass me sum water
hit my drink and she put her mouth on my bottle

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Look at the pants that I hit for 650
but I ain't trippin thoe up in my glous
and I bet you gone see exspensive though
from chicago I kill em with the window on my feel
but the stain as all you haters
I'm shinin in my diablo match the pants
and I'm real clean so drive slow
she said she like the way hurricane dress
I said you puttin wrinkles in my shirt
get off my chest on my shoes and I go
bat bat bat bat back off in the club
and I be dope boi dope boi fresh
take a look at my fist and I bet
you gone give me my respect [x2]

[Chorus]</pre>
