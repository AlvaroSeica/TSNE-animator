[Hook]
Knuck if you buck boy [repeat 10x]
Knuck if you buck
Knuck if you buck
Knuck if you buck
Kn Kn Kn Kn Kn Kn
Knuck if you buck boy

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Well I'ma gat totin' pistol holdin' nigga on yo damn street
Stompin jumpin bumpin and we krunck off in this damn thing
Throwin dem bows up at deez hoes
They screamin they bleedin from they nose
But when we start to swing we makin niggaz hit the flo'
Ain't no game off in this thang, we be deep off in yo party
Crime mob niggaz gettin started
Ellenwood niggaz be the hardest
So if a nigga come and run they mouth just like ho
Punch 'em dead up in his nose and stomp his ass down to the flo'

[Verse 2]
Yeah we knuckin and buckin and ready to fight
I betcha Im'a throw dem thangs so haters best to think twice
See me I ain't nothin nice, and crime mob it ain't no stoppin'
It be like Sadaam Husein, Hitler, and Osama Bin Laden
Now they steady gum poppin and I am actin' a fool
I wish a hater would get crunk up on this crime mob crew
Now enough is enough boy, rough and stuck boy
Luck is a must boy, Knuck if buck boy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Jumpin off from on the stage
Throwin bows like Johnny Cage
All my niggaz startin' riots, knockin down the barracade
Ellenwood, we be to deep, and M.O.B is to elite
Flawless niggaz lawless, you'll be jawless gettin close to me
Bullets bustin constantly, rappin in yo city streets
Broken bones lay alone scattered 'cross the concrete
Knuckin if you buckin you'll be duckin if you get to close
In my eyes you wasn't wise I think it's time I knuck you ho

[Verse 4]
I come in da club shakin my dreads,
Throwin deez bows and bustin these heads
Bitch you irrelevant step to my residence
Besta back up for I send you ellect
I been in drama and commiting a crime
Not leavin trace not leavin a line
We knuckin and buckin cuz I got a nine
I blow you away cuz you wastin my time
Stupid ass niggaz i know what to do
I waste yo ass you fuck wit my crew
I'm through wit you haters so watch what you do
You talkin to me and I'm talkin to you
You buckin on us and we sit in yo class
You buckin on me and that shit gone get nasty
I'm colder than ice and I'm freezing out here
I shot at yo CD but you cannot tell

[Verse 5]
Knuck if you buck boy bitch you betta come equip
I got some shit off in my trunk thats gonna make yo body flip
Hollow tips bustin out the rib soon as a hit the do'
Anybody make a false move they body's on the flo'
Fuckin wit no hoes, ain't neva been no lames
Neva been no pussy niggaz scared to throw them thangs mayne

Fuckin wit dem HP niggas you bout to get yo wig split
