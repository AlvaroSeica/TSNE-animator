Song:   Mob Life
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My room is full of that smoke
I'm fucken high, delusional..
Let the motherfuckin' gun bust
Southside and the color of my rag I trust
Rush, enemies for the fuck of it
I smoke weed for the fuck of it
From not getting, then I might be focused on my hustlin'..
Two bad bitches that I just met, two bad bitches got a husband
Sucios life, trust me, I give em love, nothing
I'm from the rugged ass streets
Where the motherfuckers die when they go against me
'45 on the waist, bandana on the face, robbery..

[Chorus]
(sucios..that mob life)
(sucios..that mob life)
(Rollin' blunts..loading guns)
(my enemies it's onsight)

That bang bang bang...
Bang bang bang...
Bang bang bang
Load em up
Load em up

This ones for the Capo
Escobar on that Pablo
Music for them D-boys
Musica for them Narcos
Dolla bills, dolla bills
The king so sick, I needa pop a pill
Success feels good, I tell you how I feel
Baby Gunz countin' money in a powerwheel
Two deep in a Bonneville
Youtube views, can you count a mill?
&amp; another mill, I need a hundred more
My bitch counting money we could flood the floor
I needed a blunt so I went, hit the store
Called em to the P, said I needed some more
818 to the 714
Sucio with that mob life

[Chorus]
(sucios..that mob life)
(sucios..that mob life)
(Rollin' blunts..loading guns)
(my enemies it's onsight)

That bang bang bang...
Bang bang bang...
Bang bang bang
Load em up
Load em up...</pre>
