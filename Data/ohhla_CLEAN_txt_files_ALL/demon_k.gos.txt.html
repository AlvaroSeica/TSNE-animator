[Preaching]
It says "And I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven:
and whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven:
and whatsoever thou shalt loose
In other words, God was telling us that we had to bind Satan
but Satan is not by himself. And then at times we only say "Satan I bind you"
but we must now say "Satan I bind you
I bind your angelic race, and I bind your demon spirits"
And where do we bind them up at? We bind them from where theres a gates
We bind them in the heavenlies, the earthly realm
the underworld, and the underseas. In The Name of Jesus Christ

(growl) theres been damage to my kingdom
what are we dealing with ??
who are they ??

see you dealin with a Born Again Believer, a King James reader
when it come to puttin in work I got more stripes than a zebra
see the demon murderer in progress
I'm grippin the falling star like his name was sirus, then I put two up in where he digest
why stress, I jest, put it down on cise so why kess (??)
you cant deal with the real, let alone the steal, let me get this off of my chest
why yes I'm just a spiritual cap peela, life killa, blood spilla
to make it blunt a straight demon killa
the other day I had a dream, it seemed
that I was crowned the king, given the kingdom and the black queen
but I told the kingdom bye, and I kissed the queen goodbye
cuz i'd rather floss up in the ghetto and see demons die
see I dont have no love for demons and they dont love me
so I grabs my KJV and I puts it down constantly
takes authority over the strong man when I'm 459in him
he's always on my mind and I'm going to sleep and I'm dreamin of bindin him
always a gaze of breakin darkness in a hundred ways
you check my fault like I'm on fast and pray a hundred days (??)
and in yo midst like a guerilla, pleadin the blood over your pillar
its the Sanctified, Bloodwashed, demon killa, killa

(demon) 4 holes, 3 nails
(killa) the Blood of Christ will prevail
yea though I walk thru the valley of the shadows of my neighborhood
I fears no evil
(demon) 4 holes, 3 nails
(killa) the Blood of Christ will prevail

yea though I walk thru the valley of the shadows of my neighborhood
I fears no evil
  I'm posted outside the gates of Hell, shhh
I got the Blood of Christ so they cant prevail
I hear em talkin, they dont know I'm stalkin
the thrill to leave more dead, slugs in they forehead
NIV S T R A P P E D
in my H A N D, C R double E P with me
I kicks in the gate, now its too late
its no escape, I got the Shield of Faith, and I'm shooting Scriptures like a tray 8 (??)
a wounded demon pleain, sayin it wasnt him that cursed me
but I pleads the Blood, "you gets no love", this devil dont get no mercy
I gave the wicked fools the blues with this Good News
so tell me what you would've done if you was in my shoes
I never sweat confrontation, loc, cause I'm a kneela
so how you feel with the real, devil, this is demon killa

(demon) 4 holes, 3 nails
(killa) the Blood of Christ will prevail
yea though I walk thru the valley of the shadows of my neighborhood
I fears no evil
(demon) 4 holes, 3 nails
(killa) the Blood of Christ will prevail

yea though I walk thru the valley of the shadows of my neighborhood
I fears no evil
young growing up I was never understandin, G
that it was the devil who broke up my happy family
had my mom on crack, my daddy on heroine
now my Bible's my gun, I'm shootin Scripture like teflon
see, all my life he had my bound to no good
till I met a G named Christ had totally put me on your hood
He said "step into the circle where the Annointing rains hot"
it made me close my eyes and grab my gut like I was shot
infillment of the Holy Ghost, loc it was so cool
aaaaah, time to go to war fool
its on from now on, I'm a Christian on a mission
till they kill me, could they kill me, you dont feel me
cuz if you did you would get with this, 187 on wickedness
yes the devils tripping and I'm stickin this
Sword of the Spirit down his esophagus
aint no stoppin us
demon killa

(demon) 4 holes, 3 nails
(killa) the Blood of Christ will prevail
yea though I walk thru the valley of the shadows of my neighborhood
I fears no evil
(demon) 4 holes, 3 nails
(killa) the Blood of Christ will prevail
yea though I walk thru the valley of the shadows of my neighborhood
I fears no evil

[Preaching]
satan operates in dimensions. he has strategic warfare against the Church
and we must know and identify our enemy in the last day
If something is going to attack me, I need to know what it is
Hallelujah. If satan is going to come against the whole Church
we need to come against his whole army. Hallelujah
If satan understands who is the apostle, prophet, evangelist
pastor, and teacher we need to know his ranks also. Hallelujah.</pre>
