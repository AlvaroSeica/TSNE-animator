(Masta Ace)
its tha bass
in yo face

Yo yo yo
YEAH!!!
1,2 1,2 uh thousand
M.A, uh it dont stop uh
it dont stop uh
yeah another one nigga wat!
Another one

[Verse 1]
M.A, I ride these tracks wit no pedels
and hold medels, since I was born i've been so ghetto
I grew up in the projects called Howitt
and if you ran from a fight, you was a coward, and got devoured
Since then, aint much change as far as I go
Accept that, I dont eat pork and I do Tybo
Still ghetto like old sneakers an new strings
or a little baby with a chain, and a few rings
I'm ghetto like a Lucy Newport
I'm ghetto like smokin' weed, drivin' through Oakland pumpin' Too $hort
A long with a few quatres, and a six-pack of St.I'z
Tha same guyz that always get high, off what you bought
I'm ghetto like turning your channels with a pair of pylers
Alotta cats claim that they ghetto, but they're liars
It's plain to see, I'm so ghetto as I claim to be
whos got as much ghetto game as me, Nobody!!

[Hook]
I'm Ghetto like...10 carrot gold rings and chains
I'm Ghetto like...Pitty pat and space games
I'm Ghetto like...Mail boxes with 5 names
I'm Ghetto like...you
Yes I'm Ghetto like...you
I'm Ghetto like...rockin a skully in mid-summer
I'm Ghetto like...A-track tapes of Stevie Wonder
I'm Ghetto like...4 tv's up in the hummer
I'm Ghetto like...you
when I'm Ghetto like...you

[Verse 2]
Every night on my block police question the theifs
I'm ghetto like finding a bottle, and catchin bees
I'm ghetto like rockin do-rag in a new jag
with NO licence and NO registration,NO hesatation
I'm ghetto like 4 chicken wings and french fries
and still wanna freestyle on the bench with the guyz
I'm ghetto like red kool-aid with madd sugar
I'm ghetto like my 3 niggas Smurf,Poonchy and Boogar
I still go back on the block to see friends
and ghetto like a benz with a spare, and 3 rims
I'm ghetto like medicade, I went to school in the ghetto and I still gotta  better grade
there's a whole lotta chedder made, people are soo broke
I'm ghetto like taking a shower with no soap
An from the heart this the way it gotta be
You can take me outta it, but cant take it outta me
Hear me out

[Hook]
I'm Ghetto like...10 carrot gold rings and chains
I'm Ghetto like...Pitty pat and space games
I'm Ghetto like...Mail boxes with 5 names
I'm Ghetto like...you
and I'm Ghetto like...you
I'm Ghetto like...rockin a skully in mid-summer
I'm Ghetto like...A-track tapes of Stevie Wonder
I'm Ghetto like...4 tv's up in the hummer
I'm Ghetto like...you
yes I'm Ghetto like...you

[Verse 3]
I'm ghetto like a big blonde weieve and some lee press-ons
and ruker park with high heels and a new dress on
I'm ghetto like them chicks that hate kobe's white feonsay
I wanna try to fight her, Brandy and Bionsay
I'm ghetto like them bitches who boost minx and a griddle
YO! I'm more ghetto than a crab end on merdole
I'm ghetto like goin' to the grammys in a Va'lore
try the dress, than the next day taking it back to the store
including the shoes you wore, with the bottom taped up
so you could dance all night without getting the bottom scraped up
I'm ghetto like going food shopping at house slippers and pink rollers
pushing 2 babies in 1 stroller
Can a rapper tell you he more ghetto than me
M.A theres nothing in the world that I would rather be
Then Ghetto *echos*
Yeah! Soooo Ghetto


[Hook]
I'm Ghetto like...10 carrot gold rings and chains
I'm Ghetto like...Pitty pat and space games
I'm Ghetto like...Mail boxes with 5 names
I'm Ghetto like...you
and I'm Ghetto like...you
I'm Ghetto like...rockin a skully in mid-summer
I'm Ghetto like...A-track tapes of Stevie Wonder
I'm Ghetto like...4 tv's up in the hummer
