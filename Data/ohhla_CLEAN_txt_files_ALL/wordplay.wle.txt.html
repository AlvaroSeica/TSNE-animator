[Intro] [Wale]
Wale, Spitta, 9th Wonder. Class is in session

[Verse One] [Wale]
All them niggas pitch verbs, so they say
My weaponry is words, Doe-Ray-Me
The wars in the form of po-et-ry
So it's straight C4 from the thoughts I bring
Bang
Epiphany, them niggas is gimmicks to me
I can eradicate a village if you give me a beat
Huh
I'm that bomb when that hand write 
Play me for a stepping stone then, I land mine
Huh
Now walk to it with your land mind
I can make the clouds jealous nigga I am that fly
Listen to the words I'm a wizard with it
Wittier than any nigga, sicker then a wino kidney liver
Y'all riddles don't tickle a bit
Y'all similes is literal shit
No I'm the metaphor of that, my rhetoric inedible
This excrement means excellent rap, I make a lesser adapt

[Chorus]
Wooooooooorrrrrrrrddddddddddd Play
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word
Wooooooooorrrrrrrrddddddddddd Play
Wooooooooorrrrrrrrddddddddddd Play
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word

[Curren$y talking]:
Park my plane right there. (Wooooooooorrrrrrrrddddddddddd Play)
Leave the key's with that bitch. Jets.

[Verse Two] [Curren$y]
Spitta flip syllables for residuals
Majors misbehavin' I'ma have to take it digital
Livin' underground like a Godfather Buried Alive
I ride by bumpin' Shine I do just that
Nigga ain't nothin sweet like a Kool Aid pack
Bitches roll sweets as I lay back in the sweet
Developin' cavities cause revenge is sweet
Every time I rap I unwrap another piece
An eighth of grape ape hella joints to the head got my eyes all varsity red
Sunroof flow so over your head, SB horror pack monsters under my bed

[Chorus]
Wooooooooorrrrrrrrddddddddddd Play
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word
Wooooooooorrrrrrrrddddddddddd Play
Wooooooooorrrrrrrrddddddddddd Play
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word</pre>
