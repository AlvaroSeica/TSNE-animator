Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah
Everybody wanna be heard. Everybody wanna be seen.
Everybody wanna be known, and everybody got some dreams
We wanna be understood, not overlooked
And when we fall, who gon' carry (Carrie) us? Underwood
We need love and affection, time and attention
Affirmation, acceptance, someone to give direction
Set apart from the rest and we wanna stand distinguished
And be The Cool Kid like they're Chuck Inglish
Been on a quest for this, ever since Genesis
But settling for fools gold, instead of what the treasure is
Chasing after Numbers yo, this must have been our Exodus
We don't want no Jesus 'less He's chillin' on our necklaces

Formerly known, way before the moment I was born
I'm not an accident or a clone, yeah
The One that made me gave me purpose
Now I don't gotta go on searching
Formerly known, way before the moment I was born
I'm not an accident all alone, yeah
The One that made me, gave me purpose
Now I don't gotta go on searching
Formerly Known

Yeah, whoo, what you lookin' at now, not what I always been
I ain't braggin' on my past, but buddy I was trapped in sin
No power in myself, to overcome my flesh
I bought clothes to get undressed, but God revealed my nakedness
A hostile enemy, speech was all venom-y
Jesus was a nice guy, but wasn't no friend of me
My lips said I loved Him, my actions despised His reign
I had my own agenda, I was my own king
Then He came, I was changed by grace through faith
Every dollar that I owed it was payed, payed, payed, payed
Sin bill was something I couldn't pick up
Now I got my hands raised high like a stickup
He know me even better than I know myself
Every hair on my head, every need I felt
So before I'm gone, gotta get to know Him
C-Lite no more but the light still on

Formerly known, way before the moment I was born
I'm not an accident or a clone, yeah
The One that made me, gave me purpose
Now I don't gotta go on searching
Formerly known, way before the moment I was born
I'm not an accident all alone, yeah
The One that made me gave me purpose
Now I don't gotta go on searching
Formerly Known

Before I'm gone, gotta get to know Him
C-Lite no more but the Light still on

Formerly known, way before the moment I was born
I'm not an accident or a clone, yeah
The One that made me gave me purpose
Now I don't gotta go on searching
