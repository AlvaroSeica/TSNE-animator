[Chilli]
A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a busta
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So...

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of time and

1 - 	I don't want no scrub
	A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
	Hangin' out the passenger side
	Of his best friend's ride
	Trying to holla at me
	I don't want no scrub
	A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
	Hangin' out the passenger side
	Of his best friend's ride
	Trying to holla at me

[Chilli]
Well a scrub checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know he can not approach me
Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass
So...No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of time and

Repeat 1

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma 
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no

No scrub, no scrub
No, no
No scrub, no scrub
No, no 

Repeat 1

[Left Eye]
See... if you can't spatially expand my horizons
Then that leaves you in a class with the scrubs, never rising
I don't find it surprisingIf you don't have the G's to please me 
And bounce from over here to the coast of overseas, so
Let me give you something to think about
Innovate your mind wit' intentions to turn you out
Don't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
Do it clear as DVD on digital T.V. screens
Satisfy my appetite wit' something spectacular
Check ya vernacular, and then I get back to ya
With diamond-like precision 
Insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from ya friend's Expedition
Mister Big Willie, if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a Silly Ho?
Not really, T-Boz, and all my senoritas
Is steppin' on ya Fila's, but you don't hear me though

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
