Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I don't give a fuck if you bitch niggas like me
I still go dumb and I'm so fucking iffy
Boy I'm riding with the mac and I might dream lighty
Pop your shit off your bag don't get excited
I never get excited I just get that money
I done fell of before, that was that get back money
I did stuff on the floor just to get that money
Sometimes I ain't always gonn get that ugly
But the sun come out and the candy 2
I'm lining 32 on smoke out the roof, get your issue
Big pistol, same color a nickel, hit you up long range
Now you look like a pickle
Who would know that my life would be saved by a pencil
Niggas out popping pistols, I avoided the missiles
Locked down in the cells, the war stays with you
Nigga bullet's like a book they grip you
... me nigga, don't fool me nigga
I don't give a fuck, middle finger to bitches
Fuck these hater niggas and fuck these snitches
And they fuck they house man, man the soft come out
What you gonn do when they get ya
I be in bees before, I'm praid up forever
Yeah bitch with the vest and the sweater
Riding down the street man with a trunk full of metal
We're riding with the mac, we're going out together
Better watch this bitch, yeah maine,
I'm a tell you keep it gangster main
Keep shit on watch maine, you feel me?
I'm based for life nigga

So based, so based, oh damn
I'm so based, I'm so based
I'm so based, oh based, oh damn
I'm so based, I'm so based

Met a girl outside and she blowing me kisses
I'm a tell her like this bitch I'm on a mission
Saving your lame... don't get it twisted
Man I'm in the back street like I'm in...
Sometimes I feel like a genie, I got a couple of 9 to show me bikini
I'm just tryina go platinum like my nigga weezy
I'm a soldier in the field bitch don't try to jail me
Shout out to the real man they catching deals
Don't play with the skrill, hoe call me dr. phil
Bitch I'm in it for the kill, you feel me
Hey what's real?</pre>
