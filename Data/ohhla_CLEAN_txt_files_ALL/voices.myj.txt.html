"He's a living legend.."

[Murs the Problem Child]
Damn!  Y'all fools conceited -- reaction to the title
heard the first time but quickly changed your mind
once the performance is completed -- seated in the back
Too cool to throw yo' hands up; I never quite understood
alla that -- what you too tough to have fun?
Frisked at the door so I know it ain't the gun
in your waistline that got you shootin daggers in my face
when I rhyme -- times done changed and it's strange
Got motherfuckers ain't smiled at a rap show in a while
Probably since the Fresh Prince was in style
So it's apparent that you just don't understand
The meanest mug in the club, don't make yo' ass the man
Now if you wanna be a fan then that's fine
But all I really wanna do is just break through to your mind
And show you just because you did some hood time
don't make it impossible to have a good time when you out
See where I'm from, it's the hardest motherfuckers come to party
All shermed out, so what's this really all about?
You gelled, cause this man's double L, well hell
PSC tells me, it's jealousy that grips the heart
Quit wasting playing hard roles, when yo' ass is
really just a mark and I should NEVER feel threatened
Cause you see that man behind me?
MURS.. U.. R.. S..

"He's a living legend.."

[PSC - Mr. Goliath2U]
When night falls I enter; being of a higher breed
of emcee I'll injure all these would-be rap crews
The wannabe phat fools, coulda been rap dudes
Refuse em resist em like Prop 187 do Mexicans
Again and again, it's the Legends
Lucky am I on wax, and on everyone's tape
PSC the best friend of chorus
The poorest excuse for you, to quit your boyfriend
Just give him a chance (baby baby gimme one more chance)
He'll rap right, if not, check my mic all night
I rap tight, see me catching flights
at the international terminal, where you don't go
So don't go and diss, big groups, will get ripped
and tripped by mic cords, and choked, with cordless
A gift, of smooth talk, walk the walk of a winner
Far from a beginner, guess who's for dinner?

[The Crow Eligh]
Cerebral tornadoes rip logic like frolicking paperbacks
The tone is incomplete extension, in all of the later tracks
Extracting vitamins, from machinery that creates it
as long as the people are fiending for the truth
and not counterfeit, I'm the bounty sheriff merit holder
Winner of awards in the midst, of clashing swords
It's match point on the court, a point is scored
Referee the rest will see my yellow warning on the toilet seat
At least I have my dignity, infinity, a legendary entity forever

"He's a living legend.."

[Aesop]
A legendary flame of a character with no name
Same instance, persistance to have latitudes
Bruise your knees, you will lose
a life or limb, whichever you choose
Find some foe in him, words tend to catch a phrase
that will amaze most from the gazing point, with a judgment standard
Categorized into a tainted picture before it gets a chance to be painted
There's no blanket for the truth (I can't see!)
I got a loose end of a lie, this amateur he tried to get by
The size is more greater, and equator more immense
Since it makes more sense to make some sense, or maybe you know
Out of these weak ass rhymes you roam but you stay in flow
in this dense a body of mockery

[BFAP Jenkins]
Black lightning lighting up the sky, fighting the type
 Copywriting history -- writing transistory
Bay lines for your mind everytime we enter the stage
We split and fade, most, Sunspot Jonz, toast
Goodbye to crust emcees; often lonely and homely
If you could only capture the power of love
Like ten albums in this glove, R.B.I.
While you hittin pop flies.. and sacrifice your life
and die in hurricane and methane
We below shit like propane, Living Legends spiritual cocaine
In a line if you know
What's up with the times cause we straw the line
(we straw the line)

[Arata C7S] - (corrections to LIVINGLEGEND83@aol.com)
kuro manashino renso gusonto kunoki dusu bushiten nori ichi nichi 
ningen katabe dudyo noso gudyo moto niha idahe {*mumbled*} dori oku 
poto da ako bonuke ich saga shigasha ach kara godondo saga de-ku pokorono 
naka karawaki dede koro iki kata saka sama nohaso dede disura kohan, tabewan

[The Grouch]
Let's get literal it's me and my team, I got a dream
("He's a living legend..") and a clean way to achieve it
I conceived it myself, with a little bit of help, from my friends
Made amends with my soul, now I'm ready to begin
First ingredient is dope shit, and fool we already wrote it
Mix up with the motives now we're forming perfect batter
Had a vision it would burn, if I measured too precisely
I add a pinch here and, there if the spice be right
We might prepare this feast for many thousands
So eat when you're aroused and enjoy -- Legendary bitch!
