(Oooooh girl, Oooooh girl, Oooooh not your puppet)

[Silencer]
I gave you so many things
But then again I promise I won't be your puppet
I got you coming right back to me because I know you love it
I'm talking about this cutie
The one with the big-o-booty
The one that is thinking about me
So now we go to the movies even though
I'm kicking it with you
I'm talking to all the hynas so that means I'm not for you
You page me to tell me that you wanna be with me
You thinking about me everyday and I'm your fantasy
But hey baby
There's so many hynas around and I don't want a lady
I say to myself that you're acting kinda crazy
To me they're al the same and I don't want a lady
So listen baby
Here I am
Here I go
You want me to pick up the telephone
But tonight
I'm gonna be with somebody else
And then I say to myself
That you need to understand that I'm not your puppet
I'm not your puppet

[Chorus]
I'm not your puppet, puppet
Oooooh, I'm not your puppet (You can't do me like that)
I'm not your puppet, puppet (I'm not your puppet baby)
I'm not your puppet, no

[Silencer]
Another day another hyna's telling me she wants to kick it
You calling me all of the time and you won't even waste a minute
So tell me
Baby doll did you really think that we could do this
I'm having like too many hynas that's waiting for me so we can do this
So who's it gonna be tonight
Which hyna is it
You gotta be looking so fine if you wanna be coming around to pay a visit
Cause I'm the Silencer and that's the way I do it
You wanna be with me tonight you telling me you wanna do it
So let me tell you
I'm tripping about so many things
I'm tripping about you
So listen cause I'm talking about you
I'm rapping about you
To me it's funny
And all because you thinking that I'm your puppet
But no I'm not
And once again no I'm not
You call again
So tell me (No I'm not)
What you really wanna do tonight
You wanna be with me tonight?
I bet you do cause that's what happens every time

[Chorus]
I'm not your puppet, puppet
No, I'm not your puppet
I'm not your puppet, puppet
I'm not your puppet, girl

[Mr. Sancho]
When I first seen you
I know I had to meet you
You're the single to your man when you telling me these eyes that I can see
through
You tell me you're alone
You wanna get it on
And now thinking of leaving him baby girl that's wrong
Don't get me wrong
I'm here when you need me
Sure I got my reasons but you ran me off the heezy fo' sheezy
I'm not your puppet (puppet)
I just want you to love it (love it)
Baby thought there's nothing of it
I'm teaching you things that you show your husband
Acuerdate cuando dijiste
Que este morenito no es un chiste fuiste
A decirle no se pongan triste
No le vayan a decir a nadien nuestros chismes
Porque, yo no hablo cuando beso (beso)
Te derrites cuando beso tu pescueso

[Chorus]
I'm not your puppet, puppet
No, I'm not your puppet, girl
I'm not your puppet, puppet
No, I'm not your puppet, girl
I'm not your puppet, girl

I'm not your puppet, puppet
No, no, no, I'm not your puppet
No I'm not</pre>
