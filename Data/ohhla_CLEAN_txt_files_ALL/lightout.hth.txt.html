[Pressure]
This whole world's in a rush to be living plush, but never rich enough
till that mirror's such a stranger, we asking, is it us?
Losing your vision, make one stupid decision
You've become the newest victim of the human condition
It's a crying shame, honestly it's a survival game
while we die in vain making somebody rich
like we scared of taking that step
Every day's just another that escaped us if we don't make an effect
Back seat revolutionaries ain't lions at heart
Even the slightest of sparks can light up the dark
And everybody want a piece of the action
like peace and relaxing became a niche for the deceased and the lacking
Success, pleasures of the flesh and beheld
Treasures and endless excesses in which we measure ourselves
I've got faith in my fam, so I can relate to the fans
Hope they understand how grateful I am, come on

[Chorus 2X]
We do it right here, right now
with my peers, my house
And fight here till the day we're gone and rest in white clouds
Life here, life out
If I'ma die here, with my doubts
then as night nears we gon' do it till they turn the lights out

[Pressure]
And it starts with us seeking an everlasting rush
Pharmaceutical market drugs, liquor or grass and dust
Murder, lust, self-worth, hurt and trust
burden us like a curse till we return to dust
Keeping us on like we're marching to the beat of a gong
Freedom is from our own hearts and those we leave them upon
Lingering on through the words that we sing in our songs
Even a strong foundation, we could blink and it's gone
So we carve out our marks and master our own path
In a castle of glass, our heart's where our homes are
Wars in our veins, that's why we walk in the rain
Of course if the name burns brighter, it was forged in the flame
And you'll never get a break 'less you're dead or make fifty
And a pension ain't a pay, you resonate with me?
I've got faith in my fam, so I can relate to the fans
I hope they understand how grateful I am, come on

[Chorus 2X]

[Pressure]
Come on
We won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go (till it's lights out)
We won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go no (somebody say)
We won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go (till it's lights out)
We won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go no (come on)
We won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go
We won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go no (till it's lights out)
We won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go
We won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go, no we won't go no (till it's lights out)</pre>
