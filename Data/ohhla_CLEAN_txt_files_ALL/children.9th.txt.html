[9th Prince]
Aiyo Camouflage Children forever revealin' like Princess tore up from the flow up
Pealin' from the ceilin', verbal abuse, I can't lose
Seude velvet, a man who kills shoes
I'm a fuckin' blow my high while Lady Sings the Blues
Or how my army had nine in the clip but shot ten dudes
Misdemeanin' nigga, dyin' from the sound
He was clappin' by the tre' pound, penals get locked down
Muslims remain lost and found
Lyrics steal railroads, especially made from the underground
Plant seeds, whether it be babies or weed
Or straight violent like mixin' leak with speed
Fuck it! Call me the Prince Keanu Reeves
Verbal bazookas up my sleeves, make a whole nation just bleed
The skate off with eighty ki's

[9th Prince]
I throw the seven-inch chamb' and smash you in ya brain
Terrorist and 9th Prince is crack/cocaine inside ya veins
Killa Kane I feel ya pain, ninety-nine names
Between the physical frame, set off alarms I drop bombs
Cut off arms cuz I'm insane
Golden gloves, I shadowbox with my ox
Ran in spots, shot up cops for their jewelery, rocks
Run for ya shoe box, grab the glock
Makaveli got love for Wu, I love 2Pac

[9th Prince]
Animosity posse, shootouts in the lobby for a hobby
Who framed Bobby? It might've been those jealous niggaz from Marcy
Lyrical Marcus Garvey, I rocks bust from Arizona to Yugoslavi'
Yo early in the mornin' in the courthouse rockin' symbols
Staten Island criminals, you small like a decibel
You specializin' in shootin' up funerals
Instrumental force by the environment
Shyheim jumped out the cabinet with forty gadgets
Islord had the sword, swung it on the parole board
Ra' killed his wife for her eskimo ice
Think twice, shit ain't pretty, my army's wild
Like niggaz from Brick City, we gritty
We leave no pity on ya committee
