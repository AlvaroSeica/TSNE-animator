Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Just be cool just relax homie
You can die you get wacked homie
Bitch I'm trappin' I got racks on me
Bitch I'm coolin' with that Mac on me
Everyday I stay strapped on me
Just be cool just relax homie
You can die you get wacked homie
Bitch I'm trappin' I got racks on me

[Fredo]
Everyday it's a different bitch
A lot of hoes don't know which to pick
Got yo main all on my dick
She like Fredo man you gettin' in
Bitch tell me some I don't know
You try to rob then you better blow
I got shooters on the fuckin' roof
Stuntin' pull up in that Bentley coupe
With that chopper hangin' out the roof
Got them bullets aimin' at your tooth
With that chopper hangin' out the roof
Got them bullets aimin' at your tooth

[Chorus]
Just be cool just relax homie
You can die you get wack homie
Bitch I'm trappin' I got racks on me
Bitch I'm coolin' with that mac on me
Everyday I stay strapped on me
Just be cool just relax homie
You can die you get wack homie
Bitch I'm trappin' I got racks on me

[King Louie]
Bands, bands, I got bands on me (Racks!)
Shoot him in his face for tryna put his hands on me (Blaow!)
Boss shit, Mister Child [?] number two swag
Already got one, now I'm working on a new bag (Bands!)
After writing all this countin' got my hands hurtin'
No tints so the haters know it's me for certain
Operation GOON, bitch we be jerkin'
Spot 'em, got 'em, pop off
Not gon' fuck with top off
They actin' like they not soft, real nigga knockoff
Bitch I'm King of Vaco [?], go loco for dinero
Dije es eho [?], clappers with the A-hole
Killers on the payroll, murder cus I say so</pre>
