Song:   Walk Tall
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Walk tall, walk tall
Even if you fall get up
Stand tall, stand tall
Even if you fall get up

Walk tall, walk tall
Even if you fall get up
Stand tall, stand tall
Even if you fall get up

Life is a lesson that we must learn
If you play with fire you might get burned
If you worry too much
You gonna get stressed
So brush off the dust
And lift up your chest

[Chorus]

Everyone creeps before they walk
Everyone cries before they talk
There comes a time you gotta be strong
So pick up your feet and sing this song

[Chorus]

Don't you worry 'bout how it looks
Not everything was written in a book
Some things you learn as you go
But here's one thing you already know

[Chorus]

Nothing is ever gonna keep me down
I jump over hurdles I'll come around
And if at first I don't succeed
I'm gonna try it again
Till I get what I need

[Chorus]

Jook it

Even if you fall get up
Even if you fall get up
Even if you fall get up
Even if you fall get up
Yeah

Walk tall, walk tall
Stand tall, stand tall
Walk tall, stand tall
Walk tall, stand tall</pre>
