(Hook)
This is for my niggaz and my bitches, ya'll know who ya'll are

Still the same it aint gon change, Fuck what you say
Behind my niggaz, my bitches, I dont play

{Verse 1}
Check, I'm givin it back to my dogz, 6th and B first of all
My nigga Slew, my nigga Wee, Lil Kirk and Paul
I'm givin it back to all the women who put up with my shit
I got love fa you hoes I dont mean to call you Biotch
I'm givin it back to the kids I be sendin to the store
Like Boo, E, Melvin and Twill lil brotha Joe
I'm givin it back to the V i aint lettin em starve
I got something fa yall and its rock hard
I'm givin it back to the Jetz from the Mac Melph Calio
Nigga disrespect that Buck him wit the Cali-Co
Back to the younger generation...
Support the college funds... for further education
Givin it back with out a doubt, no hesitatin
Gettin rid of the fake, you either roll or you pay
Im givin it back to everybody who kept it real with me
I dont consider ya'll fans... Ya'll family

(Hook 2x)

{Verse 2}
I'm givin it back to all the DJ's who be bumpin my shit
Especially that nigga Sin fa makin this one a hit
I'm givin it back to my fans I dont even know
I'm showin love at each ande every fuckin show
I'm givin it back to other artist in the industry
Who try to mark me fa how I say YA HORD ME
I'm givin it back to all the MC's before my time
Payin respect to the rappers who all live life by that iron
I'm givin it back to any hater that ever hated my shit
You could suck on my dick as long as you buy my shit
Im givin it back to my southside connection
Ya think we quiet? Start a riot nigga test em
I'm givin it back to all them hoes who could fuck like they dance
Be in the club representin just uh wobblin that ass
Im givin it back to all my niggaz that be lightin em spliffs
And ofcourse the all mighty for givin us this

(Hook 2x)

{Verse 3}
Look, if it wasnt for my people, where the fuck would I be?
Probablee in the pen for murder or roberee
But I'ma sell it while im here to tell it
Till the day that I'm gon LIl Ya the legend lives on
Known fa fuccin them hoes, ya baby moma perhapse
The nigga that invented doggin bitches, puttin they names in my raps
Them bitches LUV THAT well shit I love you too
Cause if it wasnt fa my bitches I couldnt do what I do
Look here I'd kill for my round, Shed a tear for my round
When ever my round go down, im goin down with my rounds
Flip the script, pop in the clip, these niggaz hatin on us
Top of the line bin spinners, got em kickin up dust
I love the lou-i-vile but I love me people more
They had my back in the begginin when I wasnt a pro
I gotta give it back before I lose it all
This here song is dedicated to my real dawgs

(Hook 2x)
