[Mr. Lil One]
Conversation, is going round
bitches be talking bout me all over town
I got your lady, all on my balls
ever since I was a fool in juvenile hall
You have seen me, maybe once or twice
drinking that bud or, maybe rollin dice
I got 380 for all you fools
and you best belive if you trip, then you're through
Cause...

[Chorus 2X: Mr. Lil One]
I'm sick I'm so sick, exciting... I'm so exciting to you

[Mr. Lil One]
I've been drinking, all night long
bitches all on my nuts to sing a song
Then something, I really can't hide
the devil must have sent you to be by my side
Smoking Lovelies, love that PCP
oh you'd do anything to spend the night with me
You want to feel me and I can't stop you baby
miss kinky lady, spend the night with me

Chorus [repeat to fade]</pre>
