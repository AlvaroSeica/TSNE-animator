Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Talking]
I Wait Up All Night, Now Its Morning
U've Been Gone For So Long; Didn't Even Try Calling
If U Don?T Mind Tell Me Where Have U Been
Is She The Reason Why I Ain?T Getting No Loving Cause...

[Chorus]
It's Been So Long Since U Touch Me
I Miss The Way Ur Hands Arrest Me
I Gets No Loving From U Lately
Ur Lies Has Changed The Mood; It Aggravates Me

[Verse 1]
Baby Tell Me Now What's Going On
Do I No Longer Turn U On?
Where Is The Love Baby Where It's Gone?
Cause I Feel Like Moving On
Is She Beautiful? Treats U Wonderful
Is She Qualified To Keep Satisfied?
Tell Me When U Look In Her Eyes, Do U Get Hypnotized?
Do U Ever Fantasize About Me Laying By Ur Side? Because?

[Chorus]
It's Been So Long Since U Touch Me
I Miss The Way Ur Hands Arrest Me
I Gets No Loving From U Lately
Ur Lies Has Changed The Mood; It Aggravates Me

[Verse 2: Talking]
I Smell Her Perfume All Up In The Room
U Were On The Phone Telling Her U'll Be There Soon
It Should Be Our Night Cause It's Our Honeymoon
What About The Plans We Made To Take Me To Cancoon
Wow Eeh

[Chanting]
Flight Posptpone And Yu Go Leff Me Alone, Gone Wit Otha Women And Come Back Stone
Whereabout Unknown Fulltime You Ca Move
Ca Ya Gal And Ya Cover Done Blown

[Chorus]
It's Been So Long Since U Touch Me
I Miss The Way Ur Hands Arrest Me
I Gets No Loving From U Lately
Ur Lies Has Changed The Mood; It Aggravates Me

[Verse 1]
Baby Tell Me Now What's Going On
Do I No Longer Turn U On?
Where Is The Love Baby Where Its Gone
Cause I Feel Like Moving On
Is She Beautiful? Treats U Wonderful
Is She Qualified To Keep Satisfied?
Tell Me When U Look In Her Eyes, Do U Get Hypnotized?
Have U Ever Fantasize About Me Laying By Ur Side? Oh ?

[Chorus]
It's Been So Long Since U Touch Me
I Miss The Way Ur Hands Arrest Me
I Gets No Loving From U Lately
Ur Lies Has Changed The Mood; It Aggravates Me

[Talking]
Its Like...
Its Been So Long Since U've Touched Me
I Miss The Way Ur Hands Arrest Me...</pre>
