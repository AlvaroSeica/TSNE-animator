[Intro: Fat Joe]
Rihanna! Rihanna! Heyyyyyyyy!!!!! Hoooooooo!!!!! Heyyyyyyyy!!!!!
Madonna! Madonna! Heyyyyyyyy!!!!! Hoooooooo!!!!! Heyyyyyyyy!!!!!
He is a good family man your honor! 
He does give to numerous charities!
He did pay back all the money your honor!
But do it for America!!!!

[Verse One: Fat Joe]
For the love of drug dealin, bricks to the ceilin
Tits on display relatives on payroll!
Put my mom in the mansion mink draggin off the yay
Got lifers ready to kill when I say so
C.O.'s slide me cell phones, speak italian
With my capo Jesus medallions extravagant
Sittin in the porche like I'm Tony M
Niggas tried to ex me out shoot me off the podium
From 'luxe tees to rugby's my crime syndicate
I grind in the mix you niggas rhymed into this
Pumped cracks out the wall, backed out it's ours
In Lil' Wayne's crib write crack on the wall (CRACK!!!)
Bust off on the nines but these squeeze off
Twenty three shots off of all of them jaws
For my Chi town niggas, Joey need a statue
'Cause Joey played the goalie when them things is kickin at you
Shoot like paparazzi I'll go Kanye crazy
Then beat a nigga blue like Beyonce baby
Uh! Lifestyle of the realest
Step on Donatella when I'm comin out the villa

[Interlude: DJ Premier Scratchin]
T-T-T-They should separate me from the pack
I-I-I-I-I'm the reason why the hip hop cops can patrol in the block
They must've heard I was cookin with rock-Ã¬ToraeÃ®

[Verse Two: Action Bronson]
Respect the path made, the eight fifty roof is black suede
Hair slicked back like Pat, drivin gloves zipped up
Speedin tickets gettin ripped up
Eatin chicken gettin my dick sucked
This basic Fonnie Fieg Asics
This fuckin beat make me feel like I'm in the basement
These fuckin drugs make me feel like I'm in the matrix
With a long trench, and a motherfuckin feather earring
You better cherish, before I perish
Scuba divin off the terrace, you'll last in my athletics
Super size me on the lettuce you could keep the beef
'Cause I know you tryin to keep your teeth
I like 'em greek with a petite physique
She make me healthy things to eat and never feed me meat
So I keep Chanel on the feet I'm a great man
Me and Joey sit at the table then we ate lamb
Then we shake hands

[Outro: DJ Premier Scratchin]
