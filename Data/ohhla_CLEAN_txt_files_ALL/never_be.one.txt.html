[Intro]
Sometimes My friends ask me if I've heard of the boogie man
I say yeah I've heard of the boogie man
He's my dad ... yeah hah ha ha ha
They know it, Lil Uno back 2003 the boogie man Hah ha ha
Oooh damn Yeah

[Mr. Lil One]
Heard about you motherfuckers always talking my name
Put my name up in the mud you be walking in the rain
No name no face no trace and no leads
I've been knowing what your thinking
I've been knowing all your needs
Kind of scary but I burry any thought that might expose me
Danger I'm a stranger how you motherfuckerz know me?
clear headed straight sobber and I'm bailing
Smelling gasoline what'chu looking for a challenge? Haha
Feel like I'm on acid stuck in lake Placid
Floating face down homicide I got blasted
Nah real talk am I in shock or am I dreaming?
Stranded in a thought I can hear my women screaming
Baby where you at you said that I could preach you
Reaching for the gat I cannot let them defeat'chu
I need you I read you I breath you I live you
Born with all that sin you let em win I won't forgive you
Give it to you all the only way I ever knew
I was once a little boy but this little boy grew
I been blue I been black I been gold I been bold
See my new shit in the street and it sold
Heard I won't impressive you let these words curess you
Here to give you peace I'm the preist here to bless you
Drag you off this misery pull you from the saddness
Put your gun away and run away from all the maddness
Don't be afraid even when your bodies laid
it's running lemmon aid and I bet somebody prayed
And the man always hears you never feel alone
And if anybody fears you, you can go along
Cause sometimes we need that strength
And sometimes that's all we got left
So live it to the fullest and never be ashame
And never take it back planting plack on my name yeah

[Hook]
So never be afraid it's running lemmon aid
And when your bodies laid I bet somebody prayed
Never be afraid It's running lemmon aid
And when your bodies laid I bet somebody prayed
Never be afraid It's running lemmon aid
And when your bodies laid I bet somebody prayed
Running lemmon aid so never be afraid
Cause when your bodies laid I bet somebody prayed</pre>
