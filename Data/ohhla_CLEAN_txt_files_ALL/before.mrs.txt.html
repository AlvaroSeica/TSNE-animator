(Exhales)
Lord knows(lord knows), lord knows, only he knows
So many niggas say they true to you,
coward bitches, these niggas don't give a fuck about chu', 
I know that,hmm,(really they'll tell ya though) 
but before I go,
oh yeah cause I'm gon' go,
no doubt I'mma make this whole fuckin' world feel me 
,east, west, north, everybody, south, 
I don't give a fuck where,(if youdon't feel me), 
in the pen, fuck that you will feel me,
you motherfuckers don't feel me I'mma make you feel me, 
yo' kids feel me, yo grandkids feel me, yo momma, 
yo daddy, you gon' remember me motherfucker, 
all the way through history motherfucker, 
all the way through 

Verse 1:

I'm standing on this corner giving a fuck about one-time
Got this serve on my mind ready to get my pay on this fuckin' grind
I'm ready to let that bang go 
Just in case some fool let his nine go
Cause I ain't living like no fucking ho'
I'mma split cho' wig and dance in your guts bitch
And leave my named tattooed on yo fuckin' nuts
I gives a fuck, cause my momma rent is two months behind
And if she miss anotha' month, her shit is back on the grind
And in my life shit gets no better
Never ever, just today received anotha' sorry ass letter
My lil' girl needs a new pair of tennis shoes
Cause tomorrow is my baby's first day of school
And when it comes to my baby girl
I gives a fuck about you bitches in this sorry ass world
So if you got it then I want it
If you flaunt it i'mma take it
I gives a fuck if you never ever make it bitch 

Before I die i'mma close my eyes and let em' fly
If selling dope is the way I die then let me die
Before I die i'mma close my eyes and let em' fly
If bangin' bitches is the way I die then let me die
Before I die i'mma close my eyes and let em' fly
If jackin' bitches is the way I die then let me die
Before I die nigga, 
before i die i'mma sho'nuff put my fingers on the trigger

Verse 2:
I'm sittin' in the church pew
Reminiscing the pain I put my momma through
I'm thinking about the life I live 
And all the pain I use to give
I guess I'm giving back what the lord gave me
When he took my daddy and my grandmother from me
Sent my daddy to dem' crossroads
Made em' sell his soul
Left his body cold
And left my momma eyes swole
&gt;From cryin', watching her baby grow
In the same world that got her man dying
Thats why when I make it home my momma kiss me on my jaw
Cause in my momma eyes I'm still a lil' baby star
But to these fools in dem' streets
I'm runnin' close to dem' bloody sheets
My relatives speak to me, smile in my face
But they don't like me,  at times I  wanna' bang em'
But if I do you know I'm just like the rest of em'
So I turn my back and leave em' be
Get back to dealin' with all this pain and misery inside of me

Before I die i'mma close my eyes and let em' fly
If jackin' bitches is the way I die then let me die
Before I die nigga, 
before i die i'mma sho'nuff put my fingers on the trigger</pre>
