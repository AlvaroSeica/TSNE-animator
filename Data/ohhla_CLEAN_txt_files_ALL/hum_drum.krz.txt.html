[Tech N9ne]
TECH to the N-9-N-E
I really hate when my lady ain't around (si)
When she's away, I'm straight feelin' down
Yes my euphoria button's off for sure
But when she comes through the door
(We on the floor) We on the floor
Makin lovin so hot we so in tuned when we knock boots
You say you wanna get freaky, baby I'll never stop you
I need (need) your lovin' and when it's away I'm CRUSHED!
More viewers a must and never can love me enough

[Verse 1]
She got my nose too wide open, I'm hopin'
I can see the fire for the smokin'
Baby steady ready for the pokin'
Abstinence is revoltin'
On Cloud 9's where I'm floatin so
Just stand in attention like super troopers
We off the Oompa Loompa
I wish this whole world was just the two of us
What we gon' do wit' us?
Lovin is new to a few of us
but if they hate you to be beautimous
How much can they pay
to lay with an angel get off in the uterus?
Nada for grabs ever since I had us
See they keep talkin' it just don't matter (don't matter!)
They love Kali, Baby, lay me down on the sheets, sweet half on the baby
Crazy, insatiable, greatful, I'mmma stay faithful, too low without you is too painful
(Takes a puff)
One hit and you'll forget about it, I'm numb
My pitfall's my withdrawl from you when I'm hum drum

[Chorus]
Hum Drum means she ain't around, I feel like a loser
She the only one if she wasn't I would choose her
lover girl make me feel super duper
Baby have me holla like
Hummina hummina hummina

Hum Drum she the reason for me breathin'
So done every day she be leavin'
She gimme love from the week to the weekend
Baby have me holla like
Hummina hummina hummina

[Verse 2]
Uhm uh, I be trippin off ya sorta like I kinda like ya
Give me ya lips so it'll turn into an overnighter
I can't lose you. I'm a lover, for you, I'm a fighter
Stay with me we can make it right (make it riiiight)
Hand over keys to ya
I'm on one knee for ya
I'll make a plead for ya
L-O-V-E momma
Never second-guess the affection
Comin' in your direction
You'll be my comforter, I'll be your protection
Oh I think she like me
Better yet, I know
She be textin me messages endin in "X and O's"
When I'm in it she lets it go
Reach her pinnacle and lets me know
Can't keep my tentacles off her I mean I can't let her go
She's a dime, gets inside my mind every time
She know I love you when I'm from behind
So if you got the love bucks threwin'
Watch what ya doin' the beautiful ones'll hurt you everytime leave ya Hum Drum

[Chorus]
Hum Drum means she ain't around, I feel like a loser
She the only one if she wasn't I would choose her
lover girl make me feel super duper
Baby have me holla like
Hummina hummina hummina

Hum Drum she the reason for me breathin'
So done every day she be leavin'
She gimme love from the week to the weekend
Baby have me holla like
Hummina hummina hummina</pre>
