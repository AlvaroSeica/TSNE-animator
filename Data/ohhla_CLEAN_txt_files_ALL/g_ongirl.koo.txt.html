Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
She was 5'6", brown eyes, sexy toes &amp; I liked her smile
Yes she was
Nice thighs, I won't lie, and the big ole jelly ass
And the way she danced, she turned all the boys in the room crazy
G'on girl, let me see you do the dance, do the dance for me

[Chorus]
G'on girl, let me see you do your thing
Get your ass on the dance floor, let me see you do your thing
G'on girl, let me see you do your thing
Get your ass on the dance floor
G'on, go'on, go'on girl

I want to see the sweat dripping from your body
and I want to feel your heart vibrating my body
Move to the rhythm of the jamming, jumping, funking band
and hear the last call for everyone to get out and dance
So
Come on, come one, come on, come on, come on
the dance floor's filling up so come on, come on

[Chorus]

G'on girl, let me see you do your thing
Get your ass on the dance floor, let me see you do your thing
[2x]
G'on, go'on, go'on girl
Boy, can I come get with you?
Said, I want to make bump all night
When you move in slow motion, baby, send chills all through my body
You got that gushy stuff that I want, I got to have you baby
I feel it in my hands, I feel it in my feet, I feel it taking control of me

[Chorus]

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
the dance floor's filling up so come on, come on

[Chorus]</pre>
