Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Bridge]
Yes you be no more heart
Yes you be no more heart
Yes you be, yes you be, yes you be

[Verse 1]
Dope bitch, I call er lady heroine
Met er at the stadium, movin yay out in Maryland
We stayed together, then handle weight, she would measure it
Mean but elegant, hustling, I kept a dozen then
She a veteran to this game, have many names
Checkin my swag, she used to niggas in 20 chains
Have plenty grass, we getting higher than any plane
My Mary Jane... (baby won't you...?)
I can't wait for that day to see you in Vera Wang
A wedding gown, no white gown, I marry same
Here's the toast, champagne poured over everything
You're my everything, I said it, you're everything

[Bridge]
Yes you be no more heart
Yes you be no more heart
Yes you be, yes you be, yes you be

[Chorus]
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
I think she love but she could love me not

[Verse 2]
You fucked up, you know you fucked up
You try to hide as soon as I pull the fuck up
Deep inside, could tell that you was fucked up
If you gon riot stop askin did I fuck er
Huh! 'Cause you startin to get behind yoself
You a lost soul, you still tryna find yoself
You need dough, you stress but never mind the wealth
You rather be wife like only a diamond help
But you know what I hate the most?
How you could settle for less soon as I say I'm ghost
Like you ain't hard to impress, not even daddy broke
Baby you dope, when I heard I thought they made a joke
Hah! That's my word, we 'pposed to make a toast
Like when you marry me yes, and then we leave the coast
Food for thought and even so
You don't even to approach, this here is just deeper though
Tell em...

[Bridge]
Yes you be no more heart
Yes you be no more heart
Yes you be, yes you be, yes you be

[Chorus]
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
I think she love but she could love me not

[Verse 3]
As I'm remembering bitches I used to wanna fuck
Now DM in me instant but I don't wanna fuck
Made your mama proud, she wanted us
Promised to never look down soon as my money up
Yup! I want school, baby like take notes
Spit game that stuck to em like Dre quotes
Shoot game crack, you straight dope
How you can be so wavy but you hate both?
Still don't know what to do with you
The prettiest girl can make my life as beautiful
That's 'cause it's mutual, take to tell me I shoot at you
She catch me slippin, she driven without a Subaru

[Bridge]
Yes you be no more heart
Yes you be no more heart
Yes you be, yes you be, yes you be

[Chorus]
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
I think she love but she could love me not

Listen to me...
Listen to me...
Baby won't you...?
Listen to me...</pre>
