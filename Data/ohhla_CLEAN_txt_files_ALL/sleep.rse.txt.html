{Alarm going on}
[Intro] [Rise talking]
Oh shit, what? Yeah, nah-no, yeah
Four, five, nah, I'm up. I'm up. What's up? 
Nah, we can do it. That's it. Rise
This nigga fell asleep

[Verse One]
They say, "Sleeps the cousin of death"
Life's his pops
Sleep's the black sheep, sleazy sex's the aunt
I don't need sleep, I robot
Overwrite the three laws
The mic great lightweights, can't move me on this seesaw
Caffeine and No-Doz, I'm wired to that in-box
This last nerve I hope holds to benefit this hip hop
Murder the scene and get-a-way clean
And had you
Worship my team, sayin' word to my genes
You've heard of esteem
I bring it to a whole 'nother scale
Minds in prison and I help him dig a hole out the cell
I bring champagne for real friends
Real pain for sham friends
Until this cosmic experiment, the plan ends
Watch dude's schemin' and you didn't know they fake
Be up while they operatin' like the movie Awake
Sleep
One eye open, the other mid squint
Two eyes in the back to see you rappers a wink
C'mon

[Chorus] [x4]
"I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death" - Nas 'New York State Of Mind'
Never catch me sleepin'

[Verse Two]
Yo, there lies my cocoon, you're hearin' a butterfly
There is no grave/tomb earned, spell a lullaby
I never sleep
Except after work
And tequila knocks me out like the Catholic church
And after I squirt
And after I eat
And after you speak, you rappers that's reap
But otherwise, I don't sleep
So how I still dream?
Rapid eye movement, testin', strap me to machines
Am I conscious or up on the best of y'all lies
You'll die checkin' {BOOM!}
I was just restin' my eyes
I'm not sleepin'
You are
And dreamin' of me
Makin' a song with Avid where I'm talkin' 'bout sleep
Where the metaphors? Fill it with the faith of a mustard seed
Jumped out of the frying pan and into the busted leaf
I'm John Connor, the future of rappin'
Anyone who tries to stop it will cause it to happen

[Chorus] [x4]
"I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death" - Nas 'New York State Of Mind'
Never catch me sleepin'</pre>
