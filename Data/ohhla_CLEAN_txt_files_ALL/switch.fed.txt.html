[HOOK: sample]
"I would say I've still got a lon long way to go"

[Verse 1]
Porsches Benzes trucks and Vipers
Lamborghini Gilardos, Hennies and Chryslers
All the different color gems to match the rims on ya Spider
Indianapolis throwback, Johnny Unidas
Stash box to hide it, James Bond compartments
I be out on the stage the way i'm walkin' on carpets
Another dead man, talkin' so listen to the scriptures
It's the god fifty globetrotter, paintin' ya a picture
So switch it up they makin' bigger watches, VBS diamonds
I'm a sponsor here's a chain I'm wantin' you to shine
Vegas nights Vegas lights so they know you time
A crap table and a vacation offa heavy grindin'
My prostitutes cop the work and so you know I'm jivin'
I switched it up at Yuk party off on Rapper's Island
It's a yellow brick road, these yellow diamonds got me cold
I'm throwin' money on the flo'I'm still green mile

[HOOK]
"I would say I've still got a lon long way to go"
"I would say I've still got a lon long way to go"
"Switch it up",
"Switch it up, ohhhhh"

[Verse 2]
Money talks and now I'm talkin' to him you know what he told me
Alotta people don't respect him they blow him and burn him
Lightin' cigars wid big faces livin' life like they earned him
They murder for him even spent him on attornies
So switch it up I had to break them niggas
I heard they move without God I call it atheism
I'm married to the Mob Figaz I put my guys on they click
I'm at the bar wid six chicks, six clips six six
Four door sedan it's real swift around crips
So switch it up the thirty's empty so now the fifty's extended
For my hood you know I mean it I was heavenly sent
The ghetto bird is still looking tryna find out who did it
Body the witness who watchin' me handle business
Usual suspect but I'm in Jamaica chillin' I switched it up

[HOOK]
"I would say I've still got a lon long way to go"

[Verse 3]
I done been around a while and got a lot to say
Alotta bitches intimidated cause I ice-capade
She say the sun's in the buildin' she had to put on her shades
I got a gun in the buildin' they betta watch how they play
She callin' me her best friend and say she miss them days
Flights to Boston and we ain't hoppin' on planes
I'm two seatin' through the city she say the game done changed
I got niggas everywhere and gettin' moneys my thang it's uhhh,
Fed-X international call me the dopeman
I can't wait til the boat float in
Cause this is, big business and this some sick shit
Fully auto knock 'em off and then hit the throttle
He thinks his wife's a model but she got dick to swallow
The fifty in his mouth I'ma let you suck the rollo
I call it super head I leave you super dead
I switched it up I guess I'm loyal to illegal biz

[HOOK]
"I would say I've still got a lon long way to go"
"I would say I've still got a lon long way to go"
"Switch it up",
"Switch it up, ohhhhh"</pre>
