[Intro: The Man Who Would Be King sample]
So there's a question of jurisdiction involved
But a charge of conspiracy to blackmail might be brought
	I didn't lay this information before you as a criminal prosecution, sir
	Only to save their lives
But, may I ask what particular interest you have in these scoundrels?
	Well, they happen to be.. Freemasons. Like myself
Freemasons? Those chaps? I'd think you'd strike them off your roll!
	Oh, once a Mason, always a Mason
Never could understand how perfectly pukka chaps like yourself
Can go about on public occasions, wearing aprons and sashes and
shaking hands with total strangers
Just, what is Masonry, Kipling?
	Oh, It's an ancient order..
	Dedicated to the brotherhood of man, under the all seeing eye of God
We should have done well to have left that sort of thing behind us in
England. It can never work here
	Oh there are tales that it did work here, before we ever came
	Some audacious scholars can trace it back to the builders of Solomon's Temple
Old wives' tales, I suspect
	Yes, in all likelihood, sir
Well, let's have a look at your lodge brothers

[Chorus: G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
Man, have a seat, ya whole history's a lie
The mysteries alive, god will survive
You can try to deny, ya world's not awry
All human beings must die

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
I remain anonymous, under the name G-Clef
A travelling knight of the east and the west
I try to tell you things that I think you outta know
But just because you know me, don't make you a bro
You in the matrix, souless, faceless
If you recognize my spark, and don't try to embrace this
Then ya lost - an animal - a robot
I have no patience, for one who knows not
Focus ya thoughts, and try to concentrate
I'm calling ya soul to awakeness, welcome to greatness
And leave ya stupid life alone
I clean you with the poem, John the Baptist on the microphone
All you sinners gonna die, but every religion thinks they got it
For some the church is gettin' high, till the truth hits them like a comet

[Chorus]

[Archangel Metatron]
But I survived..
There was a time when I was blind-folded and neck-noosed
Then I awoke orbiting earth looking down at the truth
From the outside lookin' in, witnessin', the masses lead towards sin
That night I had a dream, that there was no more drugs in Queens
No reason to thug for cream, that life was lived for love it seemed
No seperation, between the spirit and science
Jews and Muslims formed an alliance
Then I woke again, back on earth some shots rang
A mother, a sister, a daughter was taken for granted
Everywhere I turn, humans forsaking my planet
People living and dying for fakeness, y'all are savage
Y'all can stay average, this is Metatron
Templar Knight built with Tall Cedars of Lebanon
I build my spiritual temple forever I swear
Yo Clef, I'll meet you on the level
(G-Clef Da Mad Komposa: Now we parting on the Square)

[Chorus]

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
Some seem to resent me, when I speak this truth
The fear in ya ear, cause pain to the brain
You just complain, but that style ain't never comin' up
Dumb it up, novacain rappers just numb it up
The masses taking classes on how to be asses
But Lost Secret got the key and we givin' free passes
Pay attention, we dealing in ascension
Try to live ya life right, and may I just mention
All the people who try to do good
You like an army, especially if you just would
Stand up unite and take no halves
Don't let them play you, they just a bunch of crabs
What would you do if I told you money don't exist
Would you get pissed? Or would you be ecstatic?
I find it tragic, all the idolatry I see
I think I'll make another flood and cast it all into the fucking sea
