[Intro &amp; Chorus: Twon Gabz]
'Fore the game you say I lost
When I won you look crazy with your eyes crossed
Uh! Here's a towel to wipe your brow off
And while you at it wipe your nose and your mouth off
'Cause I'm a throw it in your face nigga, it's in your face
Now you got it on your face nigga, it's on your face
I'm a throw it in your face nigga, it's in your face
Now you got it on your face nigga, go fix your face

[Verse One: Twon Gabz]
They say Twon will never make it no way (No way)
'Cause all I did back in the day was push yay (Yay)
Now I'm writin out my own screenplay
Scored by Erick Sermon he the east coast Dre (Sermon!)
Hey! (Hey!) I came from nothin never had alot (Never had alot)
Was at the bottom so long ain't know it had a top (Uh uh)
Just a young Geto Boy who used to Rap-A-Lot (Rap-A-Lot)
Dreamin to workin my number like combination locks (Yeah!)
Peg dead by twenty one at the age of six (Six)
Lookin back I made it bitch with no eight to six (Nah)
I say Allah U Akbar 'cause I prayed and wished (Allah U Akbar)
That my music could get leaked like takin a piss
They say prom queen qill never let me have none 
Yeah right! Nigga where you think she got that gap from?!
Told me Twon G. you got bad management
Whatever! But somehow I still manage to win

[Chorus: Twon Gabz]
'Fore the game you say I lost
When I won you look crazy with your eyes crossed
Uh! Here's a towel to wipe your brow off
And while you at it wipe your nose and your mouth off
'Cause I'm a throw it in your face nigga, it's in your face
Now you got it on your face nigga, it's on your face
I'm a throw it in your face nigga, it's in your face
Now you got it on your face nigga, go fix your face

[Verse Two: Erick Sermon]
Huh! Erick Sermon, I'm what you call a icon
You a big snake nigga like a python
'Cause that shit they doin you could find, in a app
Download it, I bet you it could show you how to rap (Uh huh!)
And tell you when you write lines make sure you rhyme back
Make sure you keep it fiction 'cause nobody want that (NAH!!!)
Keep your pants hangin low, with a baseball cap
With a fat gold chain and a body full of tatts (Uh!)
Make sure you keep a bitch with a ass that's fat
Oh yeah, sell drugs too, and pump 'em out the trap
Oh yeah, you talkin money make sure you talk stacks (Uh!)
They ask if you have a gun say hell yeah I'm strapped!
How is that, that you need all that to make it?
Twenty one years I'm here so sad ain't it?
If Bango was alive this picture he couldn't paint it
If Slum V was here with D they couldn't Taint it
My career is so Yeah, Usher motherfucker!!!
Top ten you pick a number don't care, no fair
I did all of that twenty times over
Been there, done that, when you was in the stroller

[Interlude: Excerpt from Menace II Society]
You actin like a little bitch right now nigga!
Man fuck that I ain't lettin that shit ride!
We 'gon go ahead smoke all these motherfuckers
I don't care who the fuck out there! God damnit! Is you down nigga?!

[Chorus: Twon Gabz]
'Cause I'm a throw it in your face nigga, it's in your face
Now you got it on your face nigga, it's on your face
I'm a throw it in your face nigga, it's in your face
Now you got it on your face nigga, go fix your face

[Verse Three: Ryze]
Pops told me play my cards I shuffled my deck
Yeah you niggas on the team but ain't gettin no reps
Been that N.Y.G. you was ridin for Rex
Hoes call me King Tut all this gold on my neck
I roll with the best, no Ace Hood or no Khaled
Took a trip out to Rome, just for a Caesar salad
All you do is talk shit, what I say is valid
Rise, I'm on my Grizzlie like Tony Allen
When I was sixteen I went to Universal
They passed up now I'm goin in, no curfew
Big bad or purple, mixed with a little turtle
Pop a bottle watch it come around full circle
Uh! They used to play me now I'm in they playlist
Keep my head to the sky and my feet on the pavement
Uh! Thankin Diddy for them cases
Prince of my city I'm symbolizin we made it nigga!

[Chorus: Twon Gabz]
'Fore the game you say I lost
When I won you look crazy with your eyes crossed
Uh! Here's a towel to wipe your brow off
And while you at it wipe your nose and your mouth off
'Cause I'm a throw it in your face nigga, it's in your face
Now you got it on your face nigga, it's on your face
I'm a throw it in your face nigga, it's in your face
Now you got it on your face nigga, go fix your face</pre>
