[Zack de la Rocha]
Uhhh... check, check
The bastard son, I spit non-fiction
In exile for a while now with raw friction
Never be a pawn, the boomerang be upon you
like Fela with my heart in Venezuela, it's
a world favela so, fuck the novela I'm
out of the cellar with a blade and some cheddar
For this, whole new world order you to bow down
to the now sound of slavery this era be
Terrible, terror filled terrified
Why would we ever let a few white Christian
fictions shape our tomorrow followin them
Cause tomorrow got a gun to it's head

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
The time is comin
Rising like the dawn of a red sun
If you fear dyin then you're...
THEN YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD~!

[Zack de la Rocha]
I'm in the spirit of Kwame Tour√©
As I target more heads than a priest on Ash Wednesday
Paid and hangin you pigs on gold ropes
Have the, mic or my heater but you can't hold both
You could, snatch one, catch the blast of the other
I'm Chicano soprano, high off my pitch ammo
I'm the, bullet crack in your diamond pimp cup
So vest up, I'm the cross turned right side up
I'm the press leak, yo that downed your aide
I'm the orange jump suit that's tailor-made
I'm the crescent, the sickle, so sharp the blade
I'm the flick of the shank, that opened your veins
I'm the, I'm the dusk I'm the frightening calm
I'm a hole in the pipeline, I'm a roadside bomb

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
