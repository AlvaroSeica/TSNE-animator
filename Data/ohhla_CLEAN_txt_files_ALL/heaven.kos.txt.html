	uh uh
cuz I don't understand
        understand
wont you tell me please
	tell me please
whats the master plan
        master plan
spent so many days 
	many days
sitting on a cloud
	sitting on a cloud
heaven only knows
	only god knows
so I'll just move the crowd 

yo tell em
tell em
now
now
now

I break out my physical shell
and excel past the so called body
used to go to the party
but now I sit and chill with the pen and the pad
dropping ill philisophical science
me and my dad we talk about life
and how it started
how we departed from lights path
and probable right math
the task at hand is making people understand that we're not who we think we are
within this land of lost the cost of souls could be so high
people be getting high wondering why we die
but it's all planned
to get your fear take the hand
we keep on returning because the lessons need learning
concerning the fact
I sing and I rap
I hold this mic contact
critics can step back and analize
I energise with cosmic rays of days
there ain't no ??? ??? of the sun

heaven only knows
cuz I don't understand
	don't undertand
wont you tell me please
	cuz I pray every day
whats the master plan
	the master plan
spent so many days 
	many days
sitting on a cloud
	sitting on a cloud
heaven only knows
	only god knows
so I'll just move the crowd 

yo
riddle me this
riddle me this
like this

melodical prodigal flows 
hypnotical blows to brain pieces
telekenisis
when I reach this pinnacle cynical clinical
microphone autobots waiting on lotto spots
trying to rock
but yo they can't understand
there's only one plan
the time is at hand
in the year two zero one one
the people of the sun return to free the righteous children
now!, I know you want to be on top of the world
giving a diamond and pearl to your girl watching your jacuzi swirl
seems like material lust
we need to look up to the heavens for imperial trust
me!, it's kinda hard when you rhyme sometimes
everybody wants to scrutinize
redifine who you are
but every person is a star
so let your light shine far
and praise god

heaven only knows
 only knows
cuz I don't understand
 don't understand now
wont you tell me please
 tell me please
whats the master plan
 I wanna know the plan
spent so many days 
 many days
sitting on a cloud
 sitting on a cloud
heaven only knows
so I'll just move the crowd 

if you feel this
sing it with me like
sing it with me like
sing it with me like

la la la lala lala
I'll just move the crowd for now

gotta move the crowd
gotta move the crowd
gotta move the crowd

la la la lala lala
I'll just move the crowd for now
