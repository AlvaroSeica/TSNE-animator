Song:   Icewater (We Still' Runnin')
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Hook: Stumik]
It's the Water and we still running...
It's the Water and we still running...
It's the Water and we still running...
It's the Water and we still running...
We still running, it's Ice dot H20

[Stumik]
It's Stumik, from the Dead Man Walking song
Get shot in your legs, bet you won't walk for long
Bitch ass, you niggas is soft as corn
I throw a bomb in your grave, now your coffin gone
I'm spitting, ammunition, now your man is missing
And your body get found, by an old man fishing
Deep in the water, on the creek with my nigga
Catch you coming out the bank, throw the piece to ya liver
It's real, I can't be stopped, my family hot
Bust off and tear the top of your candy drop
For them cats that sold rocks, hand to hand to cops
And them killas, that'll leave you in the ambulance popped
It's real, run up on you with the hammer off cock
In the Hill, niggas will hit your man with an ox
Stick you, then still go and stand on the block
You'll get found dead, buried with your hand on your cock

[Hook: Stumik w/ Polite ad-libs]
It's the Water and we still running...
It's the Water and we still running...

[Polite]
Yo, I saw the light and grabbed it, it became me
Who would of thought it would of been a mic that change me
Blood, cuz sometime be seen as aggression
Teach the youth a lesson, this what happens when you shooting weapons
Swallowed the fire, slowly watch the demons expire
They plotting my death, I heard through the wire
Should I react first, or should I be a man
And take a stand, against a plan, that's got us blacks cursed
They'll probably put a million on my head
Send a plague through the hood, they want a million of us dead
Adonis, he move like the prince he claim
They can't trap me, I'm too complex for they brain
One in the same, but I rob you for a chain
Probably murder, the cycle's a shame, it's pure ignorance
Remove the blindfold, and let your minds go
Went from a crackhead, to an educated black man

[Chorus: Stumik (D.C.)]
It's the Water and we still running...
(Flow like a river, deep as the ocean and the rain still coming)
It's the Water and we still running...
(And you can get drownt, and found dead, dragged in by the current)
It's the Water and we still running...
(So you can get wet, and left soaked, cuz the rain still coming)
It's the Water and we still running...
We still running, it's Ice dot H20

[P.C.]
Yo, you can't stop me, cuz I'm hot, front and get nine shots
I'll turn your king-size bed, into a pinebox
It's P.C., you don't know the 'pain' I 'cause'
Late night, dumping my heat, bang out whores
You can get it if you ask for it, every car that I cop
I get a stashbox, built in the dashboard
You don't want no problem, beef wouldn't last long
I'mma end it all, broad day, no mask on
And you can get it, I'm the nigga to see
Picture me backing down, I deliver the beef
Ice cold, I deliver the heat, eyes low, twisting the weed
My nine low, lift it and squeeze
Head shots, I ain't hitting ya knees
Feds watch dipping the D's, a Red Sox fitted and jeans
Red dots, I can hit you with beems, you better not
Get in between, me and my money, niggas'll bleed

[Cigar]
I was there, youngster, by them head shot hoes you mess with
I'mma coach this rap shit, I'm well connected
Gun game cocky and the flows is Lexus
Hot flows I'm blessed with, expose your best shit
You bare arms, homey, better respect it
Shots you kill with'll be the holes you rest with
I seen the best get exposed on records
Assed out, and gun pointed, stole your necklace
I'm a quiet nigga, know when I'm reckless
My tech'll leave a nigga narcoleptic
And I know when my time's up, fucker, I seen signs
Of light, so I know when to exit

[Chorus]</pre>
