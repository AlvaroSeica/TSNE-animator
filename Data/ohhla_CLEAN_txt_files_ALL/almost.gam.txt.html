[Childish Gambino]
Girl, I messed up real bad
I'm lookin back on them days that we both had
I go to bed and I dream so hard
of little mixed kids runnin in the front yard
I need you close, I need yo' kiss
I never ever ever ever knew a love like this
I, miss you more than Puffy missed B.I.G
I didn't think that you would leave a hole this big
in my - life; you need to be my wife
I made this song while holdin the pillow tight
And wishin that it was you, what can a nigga do?
Fuck this success, fuck these interviews
Fuck these phone calls, girl you are worth it
When I was happy, you were happy, you are perfect
When I was blue, you were blue, you my Smurfette
I put my best chips on the worst bet

[Childish Gambino]
Girl, I need you like I need air
And fuck these other honies I will be there
I never ever thought that I would be scared
of living in a world when you are not there
My biggest fear is that you won't give a fuck
when you play this song on your MacBook
"Is that CG? Yo, he's old news
I'm way too busy with my new dude~!"
The best time I ever had
is kissing in my shitty ass Kia van
I wish that it was me instead feeling all your pain
I know that it is different now it'll never be the same but
I swear to God our love special
You can be my No. 2 like one pencil
Or you can be my number one, I will let you
In on my life, I've changed so much since you
left, that hotel room
And if you're with another guy then go tell dude
That he could never keep us apart, he needs a better door
He'll always be the guy that you settle for
I'll always be the guy you're supposed to be with
Where the fuck is Cupid when you need him?
I'm so Sam Cooke, I need Cupid too
I play Sam Cooke and I think of you

[Childish Gambino]
Baby girl we need to be together
This song ain't for my album, this song is for the better
And even though I'm livin in a city full of strangers
They can see I'm different, they can see my anger
They can see my pain, they can see the way I talk about you
They see the way I'm living and I won't live long without you
I drink every night, I smoke more too
I think that it is safe to say it's death or you
I need you more now than I ever did
I'm still the same guy you fell in love with
I need a second chance like I need a prayer
Sometimes I think God just doesn't care
I hope he has a plan for both you and I
So we can be together at a different time
Remember when I'd come home late
and you'd be crying over some food on a cold plate?
I'll never do that shit to you again
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever known and my best friend
Baby girl we need to make up
And when I dream of you, I don't want to wake up
And when I don't dream, I don't want to wake up
I'd rather die now than not have your touch
Cause I miss you so much...</pre>
