Now my name is Adrock I've got a story to tell
And when I rock the crowd the crowd we all yell
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell
And when I start to rhyme well I rhyme the rhyme well

Oh you didn't know I got the flow
I could sing, rap, dance in just one show
With the cornbread stuffin' with the Blimpie Bluffin
Mother fuckin' Yosi with his goddamn muffins
Hey could you please pass me the peas
And let me get a tissue if you think your're gonna sneeze
I'm the player and the coach I'm no roach
I bought my grandma a brand new brooch

Well I'm MCA with a story to tell
When I rock the crowd I rock the crowd well
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell
'Cause when I start to rhyme well I rhyme the rhyme well

'Cause I'm a craftsman, who ain't fastin'
I'll take you to task everyone of y'all draftsman
I'm rehashin' and ain't maskin'
Bringin' the beat back and keepin' it lastin'
Keepin' it top notch, beyond passin'
Simmer in the pan 'cause, I ain't a flashin'
I'm party crashin' so you better batten
Down those hatches stop procrastin-

Well I'm Mike D with a story to tell
And when I rock the crowd the crowd we all yell
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell
'Cause when I start to rhyme I rhyme the rhyme well

Went to the top and never went pop and
Came back down but still not stopping
I'm not even asking, "Yo what's cracking?"
Serving MC's on a platter like baked alaskan
So start packin' because I'm back in
The game of hiphop representin' Manhattan

Now push the pause button then start ducking
Shhhhh you heard me like I'm E.F. Hutton, E.F. Shhhh  WELL
Hutton shhhhhhhh, Hutton shhh, Hutton shhhhhhh
Hutton SHHHHHHHHH!!!!

Shhhh you heard me like I'm E.F. Hutton
E.F. shhhh  Well
Hutton shhhh Well
Hutton shhhh Well
Hutton shhhh Well
Hutton shhhh Well</pre>
