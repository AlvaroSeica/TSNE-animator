[Hook]
What the fuck, you niggaz gon do
When my niggaz, come running for you - 2x
What the fuck, you hoes gon do
When my niggaz come, spitting that game
We pimps, playas macks
Believe that baby, ain't a damn thing changed

[Magic]
I'm in my Navigator, passing up all the haters
I give em holla like, why shaggy I'll see you later
I'm with my fucking crew, we 9th Ward forever
So stay the fuck away from us, is what you niggaz better
We taking all the cheddar, my crew be the hardest
We may be few, but we damn sho' shouldn't be disregarded
You see us in them clubs, hanging out with the thugs
And surrounded by a bunch of bitches, showing us love
Smoking the finest doe-doe, fuck with us a no-no
I'll have to get the fo'-fo', I don't wan' kill no black folk
So keep your distance shaggy, understand lil' whodie
'Fore I be locked in handcuffs, back down with Sheriff Foldy
When y'all was flipping pilla's, I was fighting with killers
Charging twenty G's to get rid of, every pussy nigga
Another bad creation, so don't try my patience
I kill for fun, like it's a ragreation

[Hook]

[Magic]
And to you sheisty bitches, looking for my riches
I bought twenty acres of land, and dug twenty ditches
See I refuse to let go, of a single peso
So stay the fuck up off of me, you trifling garbage stank hoe
This ain't for all the women, just the gold diggers
All up in a nigga face, cause I got a couple figgas
I know how to treat a woman, if she got some class
But if she don't, she'll get a foot up in her fucking ass
See I'm a playa baby, I got a reputation
Get booty calls from superstars, all across the nation
They call me the dicksman, I coulda been in porno
Ask them hoes about my magic, see if I'm fa sho though
I keep's it on the low-low, cause if my wifey do that
She'd prolly buy a Louis slugger, whip a nigga blue-black
See I'm a casanova, mixed with a little rover
I'm more doggy than Snoop, when I'm in them hoes over

[Hook]

[Magic]
I'm bout my millions, I stay away from fonies
I keep my niggaz with me, to fuck all these tenderonies
By 2001, I should be international
Hoes in every city, that shouldn't be a hassle
Now let's be rational, who could withstand this
I'm here to show that every rapper, in the world is pissed
Me and my niggaz balling, you and your niggaz falling
You ain't know me last year, so nigga keep'a calling
It's all about my family, I know you can't stand me
That's all fine and dandy, I'll see you at the Grammy's
Sitting next...then my lesson cycle
Bling-blinging on his ass, Roley ice is so cold
I'm buying brand new Bentleys, off the showroom flo'
Then raffle the bitch off, to the homeless and po'
It's my time my nigga, so part the red sea
And wait till you motherfuckers, get a load of me ha
