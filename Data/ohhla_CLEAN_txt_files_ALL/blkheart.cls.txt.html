[CL Smooth]
Ohh man
This is Black Heart Radio man
We up here poppin champagne man all crazy man
They just dumped 80 thousand on the table and all that man
All over the track board man, we lightin up cigars
Got the broads runnin 'round here half naked man
This is Black Heart Radio, live, satellite from New York City
We got the legendary, Black Heart President
CL Smooth in the house with us tonight
He gon' come through and bless us with a couple of questions
we wanna ask the God, word up about his NEW LP, "American Me"
Yo God~! The streets is TALKIN right now fam
Yo word is bond, the legend is back B
This is Black Heart Radio, don't touch the DIAL!!</pre>
