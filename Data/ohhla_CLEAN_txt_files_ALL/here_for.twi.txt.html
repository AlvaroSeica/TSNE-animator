twizzy here forever I ain't never going outty
mr four ring king now I'm swinging in the outty
I needs me a girl that's grown so to ya I marry
I was born in 93 by 2 I was bad like larry

I'm a beast can't get with me getting keys to my own city
and the swag oh so pretty got me feeling like I'm diddy
take that take that you got it I made that
yea my swag you can hate that
brand new crib you gonna get that
all I wanna know is where the lake at?
big ballin man like where the cake at?
cb girl you gotta date that
go out eat like where the steak at?
yes I'm the best you already know that
vbs ain't gotta show that
pay 50 racks show me where the shows at
you don't need to know where taz bo at
and I'm a kid to the whole world I'm like diddy
[?] can't put on for the city
tell me who can put on like me
riding in the qg with no id
not getting pulled over cause the cops know t
jusr let me go cue [?]
matter as fact escort like a fleet
why why cause all the doors closing on me
twist!

twizzy here forever I ain't never going outty
man these niggaz on my stick but first they out to try to doubt me
I roll with smart guy like a bunch of guys married
I was born in 93 by 2 I bad like larry
twizzy here forever I ain't never going outty
man these niggaz on my stick but first they out to try to doubt me
I roll with smart guy like a bunch of guys married
I was born in 93 by 2 I bad like larry

I'm a beast can't get with me getting keys to my own bentley
I'm the teen of the century getting green like mike fentley
at the lopera eenie minie mo here we go I got flow
so I jumped in the jag and pushed the pedal to the floor
here I go I be that beast coming out the oc
ya'll know me it's lil t young pebo running through big t
ha her names crystal you know her went to every school in the d
cause she whipped on every girl so she could'ntjust go to 3
I'm a rock wheres my band time to cook so wheres my pan
hit the lock trying to get [?] cause I don't want no foot or hands
on my twitter take a picture send it out to all my fans
cause I do it for the people those others don't stand a chance

twizzy here forever I ain't never going outty
man these niggaz on my stick but first they out to try to doubt me
I roll with smart guy like a bunch of guys married
I was born in 93 by 2 I bad like larry
twizzy here forever I ain't never going outty
man these niggaz on my stick but first they out to try to doubt me
I roll with smart guy like a bunch of guys married
I was born in 93 by 2 I bad like larry
