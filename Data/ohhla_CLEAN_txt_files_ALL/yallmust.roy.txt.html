[Intro]
Everybody...
Get on your feet.. right now...
For Roy Jones Jr....
The best pound for pound fighter in the world...
Whoever don't agree... ya know what?
I guess - y'all musta forgot! ...

[Roy Jones Jr.]
When they stole my gold medal in Seoul, Korea
Let's look back at my whole career
Cuz y'all musta forgot! ....
The "best pound for pound" is mine
Hit Percy Harris with four hooks at one time
Y'all musta forgot! ....
When I beat Bernard Hopkins, and won the IBF
The right was hurt, beat him with the left
Y'all musta forgot! ....
You remember the left hook that James Toney got
Sucka move that I stole from a gamecock
Y'all musta forgot! ....
Will there be another Roy Jones? Probably not
Stopped Virgil Hill with a body shot
See y'all musta forgot! ....
I got disqualified in March of '97
After givin a whippin to Montell Griffin
Late hit - my title; they had to take it
Why? I guess that's the only way I could lose
Five months later; rematch, I needs my crown
First round, one punch and he sat down
Don't get me mad cuz I'm amped already
Took titles from fighters who was champs already
The heart and soul of boxing on HBO
What these other fighters take me fo? A joke?
Ah y'all musta forgot! ....
And they got the nerve to say I ain't fight nobody
I just make 'em look like nobody
Y'all musta forgot! ....
And David Telasco, he really asked for it
So I beat him with a fractured wrist
See y'all musta forgot! .... (remember that...)
In the ring I BOX, there is none higher
When I use these, they call me sire
To earn my kindom, I must use fire
and I won't stop boxing till I retire, I'm Roy...
Y'all musta forgot! .... Y'all musta forgot!
When I beat Reggie Johnson,
and took his light heavyweight title from him
See y'all musta forgot! That I'm nice with these
Y'all musta forgot! This is what I do
Y'all musta forgot!
We could go on and on, Mike McCallum, Vinnie Pazienza
See y'all musta forgot! .... Y'all musta forgot!
Y'all musta forgot! ......</pre>
