[Akon]
It's been so long (long, long)
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryin to be strong (strong)
But the strength I have is washin away
It won't be long (long, long)
Before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you, what's been on my mind

[Chorus 2X: Akon]
I wanna make up right now now now
I wanna make up right now now now
Wish we never broke up right now now now
We need to link up right now now now

[Akon]
Girl I know (know, know)
Mistakes were made between us two
And we show (show) our eyes that night
Even said some things weren't true
Watch you go (go, go)
And haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was
Cause you were my homie, lover and friend

[Chorus]

[Akon]
I can't lie (I miss you much)
Watchin every day that goes by (I miss you much)
Until I get you back I'm gon' try (yes I miss you much)
Cause you are the apple of my eye (girl I miss you much, I miss you much)
I can't lie (I miss you much)
Watchin every day that goes by (I miss you much)
Until I get you back I'm gon' try (yes I miss you much)
Cause you are the apple of my eye (girl I miss you much, I miss you much)

[Chorus]

[Akon]
I want you to fly with me (want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (wish you can dine with me)
The one that'll grind with me (said the one that'll grind with me)
I want you to fly with me (want you to fly)
I miss how you lie with me (ohhh, miss how you lie)
Just wish you could dine with me (wish you could dine)
The one that'll grind with me (ohhh, one that'll grind, yeah)

[Chorus] w/ ad libs</pre>
