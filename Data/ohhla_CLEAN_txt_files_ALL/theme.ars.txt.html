[D-Stroy](Background Voices)

I get open smoking suckers yoking others
(Listen) Arsonists burn
(We Do) Study potent quotent lyrics 
follow comprehend It's D-Stroy's turn(D-Who?)
Stroy, slap a man from here to Amsterdam until this track's the jam
cause that's the master plan, 
You know I have to slam out in Pakistan 
make your crew say "Who's that rapper, damn!?!"
Being bitter cause I'm butter but he shouldn't be your main concern
Versitile the style is wild so chile we constantly unadjourned
Me, See, D, Be, feeling this by the wilderness 
we ??? for unique force chief I'm that nice
you can't slap twice who the guy you despise ultilize its true we rise
to the top, crews we rock ASF (woo-woo!)
Magnificent and different, 
I'm sent to prove we a tight (monkey scream) crew
I get open smoking suckers, yoking, Hold on, that's Deva-Ju
(ahh, thats deja-vu)
True

*Mixing, then man sings,
"If I should suddenly start to shine, spin on my head and kick a rhyme"*

Look at everywhere I see that MC's rapidly producing 
while I'm choosing Pasadam
I scrape my raps on over shine and drag
(My bro, where you at)
I'm coming round the corner from across the border
learned to read-a from the every-every day 
to the t-typical it seems the full re-cipa-cipa-cal
I consider family but
*mumbling as he slows down and gets deeper then silence*
(poink)
Gimmie the mic and I
Everyone like when I
Start from Point A graph the intention of man woman and child man 
love its state elevate many a mind state(Explosion)
So, you, see, That I come some of that other
split the shee-da-shee I split the shee-da *rambles off*</pre>
