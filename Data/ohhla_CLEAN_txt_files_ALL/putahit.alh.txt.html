Typed by: Tha Masta

[Intro]
Yo yo, what the deal Darkim?
Man, we've been doin' this music for too long now
Back in summer '88 we bangin' on top of mailboxes and shit
Shit God, I got this studio up in the crib
YouknowImean? Fax set up
Come lay your shit, come make this shit together God
What the deal?

[Chorus: Darkim Be Allah]
The devil got our unity broken
Their business playin' cash in our hand could get us open
One false move and you're stuck in the groove
Just Put a Hit Out 'cause niggaz today ain't puttin' shit out

[Break: Darkim Be Allah]
That's peace God, you got all that shit God

[Darkim Be Allah]
Right now I got this money to make
Move your shit in and out of state
to push weight on your corner
Stabbed by my girl I had beef with, the former
Like livin' in a T.V. show drama
Bomb a nigga fuckin' with the charmer
Walk straight into Tomahawk, attack me
Goin' to war, like Apache
My bitch started fuckin' with the rich
My hoe turned out to be a snitch
Call my shorty, her style'll switch
I wanted G's on my wrist
Takin' the bus, I took a risk
A chance in a million
I heard out of state, you make a killin'
Feelin' my bag while I'm rememberin' my dad
Thinkin' of my seeds, how I'ma give 'em everythin' I never had
Caught a stab wound, hospital room
Smoke a fume for my people, gonna be home soon
Stay away from the tombs, the Island of Sing-Sing
The phone is tapped, just let it ring
A big money handler, I keep high stacks like a gambler
Paranoid bitches in places I should avoid
with the remedy, your family members will remember me

[Chorus]

[Darkim Be Allah]
Everybody's rappin' like it's Christmas
I love hip-hop but fuck the business
People that cash in, copy every fashion
and treat us like fads just passin'

*explosion followed by beat switch*

[Darkim Be Allah]
I live my life wreckless
I Did It for the ice on my necklace
Plus I had to make 'em all respect this
Grew up with the treacherous
I seen 'em taken out on the stretchers
I Did It how I seen 'em old niggaz bless this
I Did It 'cause I wanna live better
I risk more degrees now I melt Swiss cheese with my cheddar
I'ma do it right now, if or ever
Remain, son, I Did It through the pain
Pain, I Did It for the fast cars, I Did It for the riches
I Did It with the finest bitches
Then calmly went against the whole damn army
I Did It for my real live brothers that's slain
I Did It in the sunshine, I Did It in the rain
I Did It for the money and the fame
I Did It 'til we both came *deep breath*
Kept on goin' for the love of it
Sometimes I just do it for the fuck of it
And bitches, you'll never see the God turn religious
I Did It for the ladies, I Did It for my people
and now they wanna do it for a sequel
I Did It just to dis' them, I Did It for my brothers in the system
I Did It for my brothers that's riskin'
life and limb everyday 'til there ain't no life in 'em
I Did It thoroughly, I Did It for the bubb-illy
I Did It 'cause you niggaz don't trouble me
Queens that the God gets, I Did It from the boroughs of The Projects
