(spoken word sample)

Like Manson, like Manson
Something's fucked up here, it's just not right

(M. Sayyid)

I left my crib and slid like some barbeque ribs
Hit the bridge at 80, puffing a twig, listening to B.I.G.
The city lied on the side of my wig
I had to dig for the right street where my man lived
Pistol Peter Joker, kind of cat who'd sell a gat
if you swing cottage to a North Dakota broker
Had an addiction to coca
Owed cats ? Sosa
The night was buck like "Thriller"
I pulled out in front of his villa
He grinned like ?, with his girl, hopped in the middle
 like "Yo! What the fuck?"
"Yo! What's up? What's up?"
"Let's hit this tit joint!"

Yo, yo, bet like Midler
Pulling on a Miller,
We excelled, dipped into the striptease
slipping trees until my eyes were holier than Swiss cheese
Feeling 6 for 6 screen like Bixby
I could barely drive, laughed like the first time I drank St. Ide's and
twirled
'til I see the sign "Live girls!"
Pulled up, locked the window "Yo! Your head's gonna swirl"
Fuck that, flip, wait 'til you see this shit

Punany punana-ny-ny

It's on like 'frigerators
Bouncers with alligators
Pit faces like hellraisers wearing
Cowboy hats patted me down with a frown and half slapped
Sizzler banging out the system
Not one busted female
The spot was more flash than Korean E-mails
Ass swinging, flopping, ringing more than retail
One went in front of my eyes
A couple of rounds went by
This chick put on a disguise
like Batman, gave a lapdance
Pete was talking to this other female in black pants,
Spandex, topless, swinging tits like reels on Ampex
I heard her say something like she was ambidex
He wanted to take it to the next
Disappear with two bottles of vex
Then I looked out the window, saw two cats come out a Lex
Nodded to the bouncer, then pointed to the back where they flexed
like "Fuck sex! Wait for a check!"
"Pete! Let's jet! Let's be out! I feel a threat!"
Then I heard a shriek
The two cats from the Lex were somehow delete from the scene
but the scream was definitely a female
Young, just out of her teens
The music came to a screech
"Yo! Where the fuck is Pete?"
Blood started sticking to my feet
Then I heard a stripper flap "She's been stabbed!"
I broke out like a bad rash, back to the ?
Pete was hiding behind garbage and shit
Talking about some cats 
who had a full clip to me and that chick but missed

We rolled like "Fuck yo, I don't know!"
Dropped him off by the bridge
Came home to the lab, rolled a bag and took a drag
thinking
"Yo! Who popped the stripper?
Was it my man blowing two L's and flipped on some Jack the Ripper?
Or those Siamese cats in the Lex, iced like the Big Dipper?
You paint the picture"
