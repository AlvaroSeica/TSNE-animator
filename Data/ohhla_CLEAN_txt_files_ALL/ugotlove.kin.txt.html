[Verse Three: Snoop Dogg]
Love, and devotion, water, to the ocean
This is what we wanted, kissin, in the mornin
Pressin, my clothes, cookin, my meals
Wearin, that yes, dress just to kill
I'm so exuberant lovin how you keep movin it
Rain drops, pain stops, baby girl you keep doin it
Hold on, were two in it, nothin could ever ruin it
Your feelin on me, now your smellin on me
Uh! See my aroma makes you feel a certain way
And it's just like a holiday
Everyday of the year with a hundred thousand doves flyin way in the air
See peace is the symbol of get real close to me baby girl gimme love
Lay ya head right there, sing somethin soft to me ear

[Chorus: Aja &amp; Fatin] (Fatin) (*Aja)
You got love!!! See it all on ya (And I)
Smell it all on ya (And I) Feel it all on ya!!!!
(And you know the love is here! Said you know the love is here!)
You got love!!! See it all on ya (And I)
Smell it all on ya (And I) Feel it all on ya!!!!
(And you know the love is here!
Said you know the love is here!) (*And you know it!!!)
