(Chorus)
Dah dah dah dah dah 

Dreamy days, come what may, we feel no way
Theres gonna be fun and lots of laughter

(Chorus: repeat 2X)

I'm just a long foot barely talk
I might take of my shoes might take of my socks
Take a little peep under that frock tonight
But there be no body pop pop tonight
You know my style I keep it on a holy outa body mind blown
We in some zone
So how deep can we sow those seeds
and procede to buck the limit?
Spinnin' in a whirlpool, ecential peek
Messin' around with all those chemical rushes 
When natural highs come a whole lot cheeper
Sweet to Geha got me singin' baby baby babe
I got the sudden urge to miss behave
I want to take you away from all the stresses
Buy you nice flowers and expensive dresses
You don't belive me, you think I'm cheesy

(Chorus: repeat 2X)

I want to feel ya, I want to know ya, I want to hold ya
But at the same time situations are complex
Cause you got perticulars, I got perticulars
Old circles are sick of us 
Cause we're walkin' down a prim-rose row 
To everything and nothing
So can you picture past the honeymoon
where you beat me with a wooden spoon
And you got me sleepin' on the couch
Now I'm thinkin' who's house is this?
This is my money, this is my pain, these are my drugs
This is my brain, and its never gonna be the same

(Chorus: repeat 2X)

I'm a one man power house succeding within the scene
Son of the sir(e) livin' the love livin' the dream
Wiper snapers get jeolous it's true they don't know 
'Bout my x amount of heart break years of low dough
We professional we dealin' with bussiness 
Revolution creap up slap you on the nose bridge
Touces in the back room gettin' the dutch
And these women in my black book they all quite posh
Still I wash my own breif wash my own socks
Some cocks y'all the horny bastards gressy polls
Square peg in a round hole too much show now
Some say I'm arrogent some say I'm layed back
From a counciled fact payin' higher rate tax
Who's the that who's the geeks must be Manuva MC
With a second LP for all the girls I got the vitality
It's my

(Chorus: repeat 4X)
