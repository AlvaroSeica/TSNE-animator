"There was an incident where a police had shot a black man in the back
 and then went and plant a gun next to him and say that the guy draw a 
 gun on him which they find out after the investigation that the guy 
 didn't have no gun - The police had shot him in cold blood."

Wake up nigga!
Wake up nigga!
Wake up wake up wake up!

Backseat of the 'lac, big gat in my lap
Ready for combat, feelin like Geronimo Pratt
We had the windows cracked, headed up the strip
Black rag in my hand, don't want no prints on the clip
Hollow tips cuz we thugs with this shit my nigga
This aint no game, we bang for yo hood my nigga
I take a left at the light, turn off the headlights and ride real slow
Now holla at me when you see the 5-0
Alrite Dirty, yall boys ready?
Bout to turn drive-bys revolutionary
*POW POW POW POW POW* YEAH MUTHAFUCKA YEAH!
*POW POW POW POW POW* YEAH MUTHAFUCKA YEAH!
Look at 'em run, too scared to pull they guns
Outta shape from them coffees and them cinnamon buns
This shit is fun, how I feel when the tables is turned
Hollow tips hit yah flesh through yo vests and it burn
That's a lesson you learn, comin strait from the slums
And it don't stop till we get full freedom!

DIE DIE DIE!

Just when you thought it was safe
Police kill a little boy last night
They said it was a mistake
But that won't bring back his life
His momma couldn't believe
That it could happen to her
She prayed to God everyday
Guess it just wasn't enough

And this is a revolutionary salute, nah mean to the comrades, word, cuz this
is real shit, this aint just stories you nahmsayin?  People like Twyla Meyers
