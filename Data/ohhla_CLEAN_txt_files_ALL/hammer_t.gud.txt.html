[Verse 1]
Uh stop it nigga, you're fucking with a silver bag
Niggas think they seeing me, they starting silver packs
New Orleans, home of the murder
Niggas talking beef, I'm a cook em like a burger
Yeah two pistols, one is in my right hand
The other one got a beam light, Sean Paul I give em the light man
Murk you in your right hand, man they cut off your right hand
And take yo girl if she light scan
And bend her over on my night stand
Two much paper on me, I need a money counter
Choppa sitting in my closet, brick is on my counter
Young and reckless, VVS necklace
Talking cash shit, if you don't expect then you check it

[Chorus]
Pistol hangin out my jeans, it's hammer time
Hit the club and blow my money, it's hammer time
Tote bus full of bunnies, it's hammer time
Aks me a question, my answer bitch is hammer time
It's hammer time, it's hammer time
It's hammer time, it's hammer time
It's hammer time, it's hammer time
I hit the club and blow my money, bitch it's hammer time

[Verse 2]
I got money coming to me, and pussy right behind that
Bust it open, let me get behind that
Young money, paper to the ceiling
Red Rum, I'm about to make a killing
I'm getting to it, mind on the million
You tryina rent and lease, I'm about to buy the building
Bitch we eating, eating like it's feed up
I had a great summer, I could put my feet up
Hit the studio, bitch it's time to re-up
Bifocals on, niggas still can't see us
Big money got them bad hoes talking
I ain't gotta say shit bitch, big money talking and my

[Chorus]
Pistol hangin out my jeans, it's hammer time
Hit the club and blow my money, it's hammer time
Tote bus full of bunnies, it's hammer time
Aks me a question, my answer bitch is hammer time
It's hammer time, it's hammer time
It's hammer time, it's hammer time
It's hammer time, it's hammer time
I hit the club and blow my money, bitch it's hammer time

[Verse 3]
Hammer in my pocket, you know I'm a bomb first
All black Bentley, I call that bitch finest words
Dice in my hand I'm a shake em like a stripper
Pick the money up and hit the dough and then I'm dipping
You know what I'm sipping, purple in my Styrofoam
I'm high as fuck, in the sky is where I belong
Down south champion, I'm a bring the title home
Overthrow your king, I could take your idols thrown
Gudda Gudda, I'm the hardest nigga speaking
What you're making in a year, I could make it on the weekend
All my cups muddy and my niggas they be chiffin
On that medical marijuana, my living room stinking and my

[Chorus]
Pistol hangin out my jeans, it's hammer time
Hit the club and blow my money, it's hammer time
Tote bus full of bunnies, it's hammer time
Aks me a question, my answer bitch is hammer time
It's hammer time, it's hammer time
It's hammer time, it's hammer time
It's hammer time, it's hammer time
I hit the club and blow my money, bitch it's hammer time</pre>
