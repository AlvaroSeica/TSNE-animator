Yeah, It's the Po' White Trash and the Trailer Park Symphony
Po, Po, Po, Po, Po, Gold Baby
It's what we all crazy about
yeah, yeah, yeah, come on

[Hook]
It's all about the gold
And the platium so cold
Put the whole trailer on hold
Ice, Platium, Gold

It's all about the gold
And the platium so cold
Put the whole trailer on hold
Ice, Platium, Gold

[Verse 1]
Yeah, me and Bubba
Hold the ice to blind my mother
Knocked out, so is my brother
I blinded the whole trailer park and the other
I ani't dissing where I'm from, I hate Chinese people
This is to the fucking Chino
Cheap Chinese food, this shit don't taste good
This is only sold in the hood
Because the fucking food is cheap
It taste like garbage heap
The Chinese guy told my "Chin, Chong, Chin"
I took out the ice and say "bling, bling, bling"
Just like the hip hop iced out chain
I know some many Chinese people have a big smart brain
That's why they have big fucking heads, what a shame
I still make more money that them fucks because I rap
I have my trailer full of gold and they think it still crap
What they talking about, they eat rats
So now they know that

[Hook]
It's all about the gold
And the platium so cold
Put the whole trailer on hold
Ice, Platium, Gold

It's all about the gold
And the platium so cold
Put the whole trailer on hold
Ice, Platium, Gold

[Verse 2]
On the internet there's always some nasty Chinese man
Eating nasty stuff like people and then to the garbage can
That's one nasty race I never can stand
I got a big paycheck worth hundred thousands
I spent it on platium and gold
The whole trailer park saw it and froze
I'm the first one to be rich in my family
I have so much platium and gold, can't you see?
Maybe It was because I blinded you
Yeah all of you Chinese fucks, what you gonna do?
I moved on from pocket change to a stack of Gs
And you see Chinese people with these
You're wrong boy, these people have no respect
Their breath stink too so their teeth need to be pecked
With their toothbrush, no wait, they don't have money
No money, no food, no nothing, that's why they live in a infested house
So they can eat the rats and roaches in the couch
And they still don't know

[Hook]
It's all about the gold
And the platium so cold
Put the whole trailer on hold
Ice, Platium, Gold

It's all about the gold
And the platium so cold
Put the whole trailer on hold
Ice, Platium, Gold  

It's all about the gold
And the platium so cold
Put the whole trailer on hold
Ice, Platium, Gold

It's all about the gold
And the platium so cold
Put the whole trailer on hold
Ice, Platium, Gold  

Yeah baby, Po' White Trash in here
The Trailer Park Symphony in here
Platium and gold baby...</pre>
