Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ya, you wish the hard way
You'll have to learn the hard way
But it's like this, yo

Some people gotta learn the hard way
I guess I'm the kinda guy who's got to find out for myself
I had to learn the hard way, Father
I'm on my knees and I'm cryin' for help

The warnin' signs like flares in the night
I proceed with my greed indeed but now in spite of the fire
I knows to burn I never learn
As the world turns on its axis I'm like Saul on the road to Damascus

I'm like broken fragments of broken glasses
Can't see the facts' from the fiction
God's voice now speakin'
But I never listened got me wishin'

I never took the hard way
'Cause every day is a hard day, turn my heart away
'Cause God be feeling like He's far away
Jesus take the scars away 'cause life be mad hard today

I'm tryin' hard not to sway
Selfish way's finally catchin' up to me
But if I fall, I know You's catchin' me, I know You's catchin' me
Yo, I know You's catchin' me
But there's times I have to learn the hard way tough, like this

Some people gotta learn the hard way
I guess I'm the kinda guy who's got to find out for myself
I had to learn the hard way, Father
I'm on my knees and I'm cryin' for help

I've been high and low but the stories told
My eyes can show that I walked the hard ways road
When it's my time to go I'll stand toe to toe
To one who grips my soul, whose never lettin' go

Life's so cold but so many times
I shed so many tears from so many eyes, spoke so many lies
I was the maker of my own demise
My own face I couldn't recognize

Woke up one day and realized my compromised lifestyle
Since the birth canal to a juvenile yo, this kid was wild
Sometimes it hurts to smile but Jesus thought
To make it worth my while I keep it versatile

Like I was could write Spanish backwards in a cursive style
But in the meanwhile to the mean time
I leave the blind to lead the blind, leave the past way far behind
All the way out of sight and out of mind

Some people gotta learn the hard way
I guess I'm the kinda guy who's got to find out for myself
I had to learn the hard way, Father
I'm on my knees and I'm cryin', I'm cryin' for help, for help
I'm cryin', I'm cryin', for help, for help, for help
Cryin', I'm cryin'

Some people gotta learn the hard way
The hard way, the hard way
Some people gotta learn the hard way
The hard way, the hard way

Some people gotta learn the hard way
I guess I'm the kinda guy who's got to find out for myself
I had to learn the hard way, Father
I'm on my knees and I'm cryin'

Some people gotta learn the hard way
I guess I'm the kinda guy who's got to find out for myself
I had to learn the hard way, Father
I'm on my knees and I'm cryin'

Some people gotta learn the hard way
I guess I'm the kinda guy who's got to find out for myself
I had to learn the hard way, Father
I'm on my knees and I'm cryin'</pre>
