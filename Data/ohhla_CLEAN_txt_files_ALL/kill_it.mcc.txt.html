Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus]
Kill it mc with your ability beams
With your newly acquired powers in this hour of need
With-with-with the the greatest of ease, put-put-put these haters to sleep
m-m-mc chris you are my hero with no fear of defeat

[mc chris]
Believe it or not, I am rocking the mic
An easy combo to remember like the lock on your bike
My name is mc chris havin the time of my life
Turn the mic into dynamite like Yosemite might, right?
Cause I got the beats and I got the flavor
The narcs on my fart like the +Ark's+ got +Raiders+
I'm makin paper, you're makin excuses
You're abusin glue sticks, sorry but the shoe fits
You're what's called a nuisance, I'm a new artist
Only got the farthest cause I'm workin the hardest
So F you hater B's need to chill real soon
Take a hammer to your grill, like I'm Oh Dae Su
I got the Lego head girl girls that smoke too much doob
Kicking ass with the 'stache of a Fu Manchu
Two blue tattoos, that used to be black
You a bad enough dude to stay off of my back?

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
Believe it or not, I can out-style all these know-it-alls
Getting greedy cause I made a CD at the local mall
Maybe these preemies need their Wheaties, perpetratin in a Powerglove
The rap's kickin back like a plastic bag of sour nugs
Gotta gargle lava if you wanna spit fire
Save the drama for your mama, we all know that shit's tired
Just cause you're hopin to flow don't mean you can open the show
You gotta girl and she at home with a head full of holes
I'm like baseball cards but with MP3s
I rock bicycle spokes, just a joke emcee
See you ride up on my grip like I got the garden yo
Let me hit the bong slow while I say WRONG BRO~!
This is for the haters that got somethin to prove
If they didn't hate on me then they'd have nothin to do
Watch me body slam a n00b on the hard concrete
I make a living musing over hardcore beats

[Chorus]
