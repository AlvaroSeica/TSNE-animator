[Intro: Carmen]
I remember when I was coming up
There were three guys that ran our neighborhood

[Chorus: Carmen]
Who was our hustler? "Smoothe!"
Who was our player?  "Iceberg!"
Who was our gambler? "Trigger!"
And everybody gathered around
When those players' work come down

[Verse One: Smoothe Da Hustler]
I remember back in the days, hustling in the crack of the case
Black gat busting back in a blaze
Whatever we was doing that was the thing
Showed niggaz how to stick, stand and move with that crack cocaine
Jumped outta the ride, everybody laughing it up and dapping it up
Damn, I ain't seen y'all niggaz in months, niggaz just passing blunts
Don't let the kids start gathering up
An autographs, we keep a pen and a pad in the cut 
But being famous that don't matter to us, we had it rough
Ask them if they pass glasses before I pass them a buck
Who said a nigga can cuff for nothing?
Hustler his ass or rap on the side of, black bitches to fuck his cash off

[Chorus: Carmen]

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I remember summer days and nights, stare at fist fights
Barbecues with my crew, kids flying their kites
Girls hugging me, bulletproof vest
The whole hood, waiting outside to see which car pulled up the next
To take the kids to the store, for some candy and snacks
Little niggaz always asking; could they see my strap
I roll up, honk my horn at like four in morn'
You run out in your house shoes, girl, you know I care about you
Every time you see me, new Gators, new shine 
Every dime in the hood; sooner or later will be mine
I'm that player in your hood, and there was always one
The one that showed you how it should be done

[Chorus: Carmen]

[Verse Three: Trigger Tha Gambler]
I used to hit the block, park the Lex, right by the Lot
Get out, hump the trunk, backseat, looking like the snicky shot
Get love, summer time, pool parties, playing Skelly
Football in dark courts, getting hit up in their belly
Ice Cream was on me, quater waters I pour them
Every kid that had potential; to the game I thought him
Girls out, jumping ropes, fourty drinking, screaming poke
Dice shooters might move us, hallways full of smoke
Old timers giving game, telling war stories on 
How old in their life they was living in pain
So they drink liquor now for living vain
The hood loved me and they won't forget my name
Since I'm gone, everything has changed

[Chorus: Carmen]

[Hook: Carmen]
I remember how it used to be, looking at those players on those memories
And how they used to ride, it was so fly, it was so fly to me
They used to talk me everyday, teaching me the game and how it should be played
Now I grown up and I know I'm always up to you
Made me into a woman, told me how to understand what really makes a man
Forever I would love the husband made me stronger than who I am

[Chorus: Carmen] </pre>
