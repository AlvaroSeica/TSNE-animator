So where you gunna go when you cant get high now
Where you gunna go when you feel so low
Where you gunna turn for some inspiration
New destination is where you should go

(D-Loc)
Confused in life in the middle of the night
I'm sittin' up with my pipe like my candle I burn
Thinkin' about my baby 
The one who really loved me
And all the time we spent together callin' each other "honey"
The separation hurts I learned from my loneliness 
Cryin' to my self thinkin' about the last kiss
But things got funny we had two different lives
So much time apart and not enough by her side
Thinkin' about my girl, yo, I'm feelin' kinda empty
The joy that you give me can't compare to any body 
How much we said that there was like no other
The bond that we had built had slowly became uncovered
But that's how it goes I'm years down the road
Miles away doin' shows I left my love out in the cold
I can't ever forget what had happened, I was wrong
I wanna get you props and shout you out in my song

(Hook)
Where you gunna go when you cant get high now
Where you gunna go when you feel so low
Where you gunna turn for some inspiration
New destination is where you should go
New destination is where you should go now
You can only go up if you feel so low

(Johnny Richter)
I can't believe I'm alive
Survive in this world but will I live till twenty-five
I'm at the farm with my bong
When you look in these eyes there's no room inside
For crooked scams or evil plans
Now wishin' hard
I don't throw out my hand to any man
And when a man extends his hand I offer blessings on his land
I put completion as a passenger and respect for your word
Good lord drop ??? drinkin' surb, barely smokin'
You gotta look at the picture and take care of your self
To live a long happy life you never needed no wealth 
 Just be stealth whatcha getting make desitions to imbess
Invision in your mind hit the kind and be blessed
Don't waste that stress simply cut that shit
You'll be mumblin' ??? about the same bull shit
And that's what happens when you let your paper control
Keep control of your goals and forget 'bout the gold so

(Hook)
Where you gunna go when you cant get high now
Where you gunna go when you feel so low
Where you gunna turn for some inspiration
New destination is where you should go
New destination is where you should go now
You can only go up if you feel so low

(Daddy X)
My soul is my life 
And so is my high
I digested the universe right through my third eye
In touch with my brother standin' over me wise
These spirits connect as four men collide 
Sharks stay in touch while others divide 
Some float and die and hang around for the ride
Sure have to live until one is died
Sheddin' your skin boy and look out from inside
So follow the light into a new life
Take a deep breath, relax  and open your eyes
Realality is yours it's what you decide
Take a deep breath, relax, and open your eyes

(D-Loc)
Baby listen, I forgot to tell you somethin'
My life's been a mess with out  Ami &amp; Dustin
I've been depressed, popped a couple of biscuts
Been stay out at night getting' fucked up, who is this
All I feel is the ghost from your presents
Thinkin' about the time we spent together fuckin' over this
It's to hard when I listen to the past
We had way too much love and that's a fact
It makes me sad but I gots to move on
So I packed up my stuff grabbed my bong and wrote a song
Wonderin' where my next destinations gunna take me
And how long I got love for Ami but now shes gone
You gotta move on 
Life's short you gotta move on
Those bongs is makin' you strong
Keep a smile on your face kidÂ…..it's time to move on

(Hook)
Where you gunna go when you cant get high now
Where you gunna go when you feel so low
Where you gunna turn for some inspiration
New destination is where you should go
New destination is where you should go now
You can only go up if you feel so low

Where you gunna go when you cant get high now
(I don't know, I don't even even know)
Where you gunna go when you feel so low
(where you gunna go where you gunna go)
A little bit of love is a medication
(a little bit of love all we need is love)
New destination is where we should go
(movin' on we gotta move on)
You can only go up if you feel so low
(where you gunna go when you feel so low)

(Fades until end)
New destination is where you should go
(where you gunna go if you feel so low)</pre>
