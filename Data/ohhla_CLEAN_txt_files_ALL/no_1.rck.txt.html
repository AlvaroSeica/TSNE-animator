[Diddy]
Ayo Bugatti boys (turn em up)
you know what it is breathe bitch breathe
breathe bitch breathe go

[Rick Ross]
Hello good morning tell me what the lick read
my cup full blowin on that good weed
my bitch bad tryna get her tipsy, in all black haters better miss me
my bitch ride better then most rappers, here's a Rose' toast to those rappers
I don't smoke no tobaccos but I smoke the most rappers
I got big tips for the waitress, bitch I got very little patience
all the bitches different by the car load, you may wanna get a different auto
deep down ya main chick even wanna cum
everybody know my name I'm number 1 I'm number 1

[Chorus]
I'm number 1 in this bitch
now they understand why I'm running this shit
from the bottom to the top
I be ballin till I drop and I'm never gone stop [x2]

[Diddy]
I'm the first one to cut a new Phantom in half
first white two seater down fifth ave
first one to write a check in the earthquake
same muthafucka that'll make the earth shake
blowin money only way to make the earth spin
ya girlfriend caught up in my whirlwind
use to move white girl out in Maryland
now my girlfriend blonde like Marilyn
we number we gettin mad more paper
aint nothin like bad boy paper we aint never gone stop

[Chorus]
Woke up this morning blessed to breath, then I say a prayer God bless the G's
I'm number 1 in this bitch now they understand why I'm running this shit
from the bottom to the top I be ballin till I drop and I'm never gone stop
I'm number one in this bitch now they understand why I'm runnin this shit

[Rick Ross]
I'm a gang member, my gang called Bugatti boys ask ya main broad
the streets cold my wrist numb I do it big ask my income
the bigger I get the more you deflate
my niggas deal dope at a rebate, spit flows like its free base
all the flows I can erase, I think I made neat goggles
all my bottles sparkle I'm the only one she obey cus its only one Rick Ross

[Chorus]
Woke up this morning blessed to breath
then I say a prayer God bless the G's
I'm number 1 in this bitch now they understand why I'm running this shit

[Trey Songz]
You can say I'm on some new shit I be number 1
and you niggas can get the dueces, Maybach music play it in the coupes
Rick Rick Ross and Trey so stupid tryna find ya girl
but I prolly made her lose it, body so tight and I know she get the lose-est
Virginia to the whole world you can get my old girl
catch me in Miami bout 4 girls tow girl I'm hot
holla at me when the summer done never been where I'm coming from number 1

[Chorus]</pre>
