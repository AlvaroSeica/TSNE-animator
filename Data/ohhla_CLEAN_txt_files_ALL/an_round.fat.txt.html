[Intro/Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
'Cause in the end girl your gonna want another round
(Another Round) another round (Another Round) another round
Girl your gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her with her
I used to want you and her and her and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you

[Chris Brown &amp; Fat Joe]
Shorty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
The bitch badder than any bitch that you name

[Fat Joe]
I'm talkin Janet, maybe Kim K, I heard Rihanna, she like it kinky
Come on!

[Verse One: Fat Joe]
Quit playin girl you know that you want it
I can tell just by the way you push it out and flaunt it
You bad.....Somethin like Dirty Diana
Body dope as heron and the sex is hard to handle
Your ex couldn't beat it, I hit it like a free throw
And since I lost some weight you say I got a big ego (I got a big ego)
It's too strong, you said you drive stick but baby just peel off
Lovin how it last long leave the sheets gushy
Fuck you with the mask on halloween pussy
Your body shivers and trembles with each and every stroke
Pussy wetter than ever, enough to sink a boat

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
'Cause in the end girl your gonna want another round
(Another Round) another round (Another Round) another round
Girl your gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her with her
I used to want you and her and her and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you

[Chris Brown &amp; Fat Joe]
Shorty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
The bitch badder than any bitch that you name

[Fat Joe]
I'm talkin Janet, maybe Kim K, I heard Rihanna, she like it kinky
Come on!

[Verse Two: Fat Joe] (Chris Brown)
Never hesitate, purchasin in every state
Transported in foreign cars in large estates
(So believe me you know you wanna come home girl!)
(As long as we can kick it with your homegirl)
A two on one fast break that's a slam dunk
I know you want it, I can take you where your man won't
Champs-Elysees, think Rolls Royce
Yellow Nuvo and pink boy shorts

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
'Cause in the end girl your gonna want another round
(Another Round) another round (Another Round) another round
Girl your gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her with her
I used to want you and her and her and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you

[Verse Three: Chris Brown]
Girl you got the bomb thing no I can't resist
I'm a light some candles girl and then tie up your wrist 
Then I'm lickin chocolate right up off your stomach
Baby you ain't had no freaky shit like this
I start drippin ice down your spine (Oh Oh!)
I'm a make you mine
And now your tellin all your girls I done tore it up
So don't be mad that they all want me, there's room for all of us

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
'Cause in the end girl your gonna want another round
(Another Round) another round (Another Round) another round
Girl your gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her with her
I used to want you and her and her and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Go girl (Yeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!)
I want you baby, make room</pre>
