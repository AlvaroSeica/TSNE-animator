Uh

Genuene back in this bitch ready to scorch some shit
Stay away from this blaze or you going be marshmallows prick
Attitude swine flu mad cow E-col
Back up on my martin shit Tommy gun no Cole
 Cause the writing on the wall so you bustas pay attention
I Got that knock UP in ya trunk this a suicide mission
Catch me chilling with my FAM Edison or the Wood
Crack slick if you want cause I wish a nigga would!!!!!!

[Hook]
I've been patiently waiting for you niggas to keep hating
Gave you hit after hit but you niggas keep debating
 Keep ya feelings to yourself or come get on my level
Yes I'm hotter than a sauna and I'm cooler then the devil
Call me
[Genuene, Gen u-win]
Yes I Got That Knock!!!!!
[Genuene, Gen u-win]
Yes I Got That Knock!!!!!
[Genuene, Gen u-win]
Yes I Got That Knock!!!!!
Bass and treble in ya spot
And it won't stop!!

This that bounce that'll make porgy pig go ham
Make ya girl's beaver not give a damn!!
In case you didn't know my shit here is the bomb
Three pointers from the line all day like Le bron
Speakers on that UGK sounds fucking out this world
One bar at the dame easily will get ya gurl
Tell two faces' fill my cup tell the DJ to crank it up
151 I'm on my way I'm about to get FUCKED UP!!
Feeling on some booties oh my bad damn excuse me
I didn't even get your name? But your ass is mighty juicy
DAMN I'm glad I'm single because I would got in trouble
Feeling on them double d's all up in this club um
Somebody pick a song I'm bout to go IN!!!!!!!!!
SWAG so official that boy genuene
Twisted senses of humor throw you in front Mac truck
I'm just kiddin' what I am sayin' I'm just SCREWED UP!!!

[Hook]
