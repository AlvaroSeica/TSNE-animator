[KiD CuDi
Okay, so you've never done this before and that's cool and all, 
but I want you to try this one, let's go, don't worry...

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
(Repeat 2x)
Get ready, pop it, let's go.. 
Enter galactic you and me, enter galactic you and me

[KiD CuDI]
I once dreamt of peace until I found you, once upon a time baby
I once had a dream so sweet until I had a taste of you, once upon a time baby
Reaching out to outer space dancing to awesome sounds, this all new to you?
Reaching out to hold your clothes so I don't slip away 
explore a new approach, a whole new free I say

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]

Get ready, pop it, let's go.. 
Enter galactic you and me, enter galactic you and me 


[KiD CuDi]
I know it's easy to imagine, but it's easier to just do, see
if you can't do what you imagine, then, what is imagination to you?
Just a waste of space in your brain
to take the place of hate, or things all the same
Tell me your secrets the things that make you tick
I like when you talk because your voice is angel-us
Hey, I want to kiss you on your space below your navalet
The taste that you keep neat, so moist like, tow-let
This will mark the day our minds and souls will connect, let's not forget the sex
my heart you can't collect, now, now
Yeah, my heart you can't collect, now, now
my heart you can't collect now, now
Have just one more gap, babe, babe, babe, have just one more stem, babe

[Chorus: KiD Cudi] (Repeat 2x)
Get ready, pop it, let's go.. 
Enter galactic you and me, enter galactic you and me

[Kid CuDi]
Pop it, ready, go, let it, take-take-take-take over
get ready, pop it, let's go, get ready
Le-le-let take it over, get ready, pop it, let's go
take it, just let it, take-take you over, get ready
Let's go..let's go.. hey

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
(Repeat 4x)
Get ready, pop it, let's go..
Enter galactic you and me, enter galactic you and me

[Common - Narrating]
Soon after falling into a deep but psychedelic state to escape the prison of our reality
our hero becomes trapped in his own peaceful place which immediately becomes his sanctuary
a place filled with his wildest dreams
This is his new home</pre>
