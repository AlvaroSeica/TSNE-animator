Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime

You see I roll it up and light it when my Zippo gets ignited
It's an addiction at this point so what's the point in tryna fight it
Pass a bong with Miley Cyrus, and Michael Phelps in a cipher
Even Schwarzenegger hit it, when I passed homie the lighter
Puffin that pharmaceutical so Cali's where I'm movin' to
Blazing on a sunny afternoon this shit it beautiful
The sun is in the sky, but you still can see the moon
While I'm (lazing on a sunny afternoon)
Cause I'm feelin' spectacular, puff puff passenger
On a NASA spacecraft up above passing ya
Abra-cadabra, I'll make the weed vanish bitch
Brain damage, tree bandit, rollin' up the cannabis
Kickin' back baby and I'm lovin' it
While I be puffin on dozens of my herbal supplements
Thatâs just how I does it, so somebody grab a dub of piff
And I'll go grab a dutch to split, we'll be getting dumb as shit

["Sunny Afternoon"]
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well give me to good reasons why I oughta stay
Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

Uh, yeah, and you know I'm not the sober type
So fuckin' high that I can barely even hold the mic
Always smoking, but yea I got probation
But fuck, rules are made to be broken right?
I'm a crazy dude, burnin' watchin' paper-view
Munchin' on some Asian food, roll a J, a haze or two
Stay higher than Harry Potter flyin' on his broom
While I'm (lazing on a sunny afternoon)
Chelsea have you seen me lately, I think I'm goin' crazy
Tokin' on a vaporizer till my brain is broken baby
Rarely sober, I cant help it I'm a stoner
Always got that fresh out the baggy weed aroma
When some say itâs a bad habit, I just fuckin' laugh at it
Grab the bong and pack it and hit it until I'm asthmatic
Brain always movin' slow like it's some bad traffic
You can't OD on pot? Shit, I'll take a stab at it

["Sunny Afternoon"]
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well give me to good reasons why I oughta stay
Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

I'm always twistin' up the ganja
Since 8th grade graduated with high honors
No one's getting higher when I roll the EZ-wider
I'll be chillin' with Harold and Kumar munchin' on some sliders
Where's my fuckin lighter, yo somebody grab the illest dose
I'll step my game up from water bottle bongs I built myself
Getting super silly, smoke fills up the room
While I'm (lazing on a sunny afternoon)
When it comes to marijuana I'm a heavy user
Even puffin in my dreams, pass a J with Freddy Kruger
It's like my medication at this point in life
I start itchin' when I'm stuck without a joint to life
Cotton mouth like I've been chewing on my t-shirt
Girls are third, money second, but I need my weed first
So you wanna burn? Hope you got an ounce to bring
Shit I gotta go, yo I'm late for drug counseling

["Sunny Afternoon"]
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well give me to good reasons why I oughta stay
Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime</pre>
