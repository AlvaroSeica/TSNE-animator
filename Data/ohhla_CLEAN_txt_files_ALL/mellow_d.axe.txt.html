[Long Axe]
I don't need to write it down 혩cause it backfires on me
Dyslexic with the pistol when the gat fires on me
No need to threaten me killing me softly
Bills keep me tossing like a fresh pot of coffee
Then the job got limits, I ain't never gonna own it
Couldn't be a supervisor I don't wake up in the morning
Hand on the bottle but my head hanging on it
Five more minutes but the shit is disappointing
I like medium __ with high hopes
Low concentration from smuggling them notes
And the women want a novel type dude
Tryna read me like a book, you wanting model type shoes
Who? Who? Not me, got you, let's see
Frustrated in the elevator pushing on three
That's, me that's right
Hurry up and wait, bad to the bone
So my muscles gonna ache, pimp money, a dollar too short
Spend it on ___, it's all I can afford
Bored with the chores, pushing four inch
Hustlers and millionaires, hustlers are bums on the bench
So if you're tired say you're tired

[Chorus: Long Axe]
Keep running, when your Hell's too close
And your Heaven too farm you know who you are
Keep running, when your job ain't working
Take a pause, you about to be a star
Keep running, when your money move slow
But you heading to the bar

[Long Axe]
What it look like, tell me what it feel like
Like different time zone, might bring the night home
Fucking 혩til the day get jealous, nobody telling
Who you spelling out, spilling, eating out, feeling out
Reaching 혩til you're close enough to pull the ceiling out
Let it out, chin high, eyes on the prize
Like what it's all about now
I don't need the stress, I don't want the burning
Give me conversation and a quarter tank of bourbon
혩Til I hit the street hurting, feet swerving
Speech keep slurring, hurry up and wait
I'm sliding to a warm place, never too late
So if you're tired, say you're tired

[Chorus]

[Long Axe]
In from the cold where the old man wanders
Will he make it back to his home in the summer?
Many young guns had an itch in their hands
Not to use this metaphor but they life had to jam
In through the clouds came a massive change
Producing those seeds on the war on pain
People see fame and became a freeze from it
I'ma skip the middle man, I'm a plan and become it
Several issues leak from my mouth
Dab to the ___ we keep out
Logic in doubt, we diabolic type people
Putting your world into evil
But you can see through straight to __ we threw
People know what we do like they how we do
I'm a mansion sitting right next to the ref
Creation manifest live and direct
So if you're tired say you're tired</pre>
