Typed by: IMARRICK@webtv.net

I can't get caught with the dirt that's in the air
the b!tches in my hair 
or those nigg@s over there
I sware commnication skills being best
so I don't wear no armor on my chest 
God bless my soul
having to get a 100 yrs. old
stable mind fool body control good as gold
sippin henj
yeah I'm sippin hen what you thought 
that sh!t will get sold that sh!t wiill get bought
I thought 
that real nigg@s understood the hustle
but yet you wanta get paid
out and in between the struggle
my mother 
my friend to the got d.amn end
 cause sometime your kin 
will do your a$$ in 
my friend  my foe my woman  my hoe
if the shoe fit yo toe 
just as long as you know who you be
look here cause I know who i be
I be the coolest as nigga bout as far as
you can see MJG
guaranteed out rump spanker
kunyak dranker deep thought thanker 
painter picture for your ears as you listen
it's bout time for you to peep
what you been you goota

Keep your mind be strong
you can't be to impatient
the government is hatin
them sticker boards is waitn by your ride
you tired of the way that life is treating you
your personal life is f*cked up 
your baby momma beeping you 
(2x)

I got hang up let downs bad breaks set backs
chart took my check back 
hopin I'm a sweat that
less that 
other finacial helps come through 
I'm a countine doin what i do stand true
within my heart I had it plan from the start
playin the cart  just only trying to do my part
all I can say is that the LORD must of bless me
cause comin up 
I know that the streets did test me
from 16 yrs. old we flowed 
and blewed joes with
nigg@s who were cold 
but old and know Moses
I had to make my own path through my math
understand that I had to be sad before
I'm glad
see life play tricks on your mind
you got to fight it 
or else you just a bumb waitng to get egnighted
I write it 
but also I live it and i'm a get it 
straight to the @ss and make sure my people 
feel it

Chorus

Who said making money easy 
sho nuff if it's illegal
i'm trying to roll a got d@mn benz 
up out this regal
the season keep passing my 
stuck in the cold 
no transportation to role
my clothes is old
the devil is trying to make me believe
that I need
what the nexst man got in order for me to achieve yes indeed
close your grip or else fall 
cause the only one catching you @ss 
gone be the walls
see time never waits for one who sits still
but some take they hole d@mn life to get real
I chill
do my own d@mn thing 
f*ck a buster 
a hoe can only get on my nerves if I trust her
now could i get pay for flattery h3ll naw
consider when you stuck me but really I stuck
yall applause give me some dap I bust raps
but you not intouch with yourself you gone snap

Chorus till he starts talkin
