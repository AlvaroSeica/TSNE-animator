[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I keep them niggaz dead in this rap shit
She gave me some head cus' this rap shit
All these niggaz dead in this rap shit
I do this for my daughter in this rap shit
I love countin' money cus' this rap shit
Don't be no dummy cus' this rap shit
Buying TEC-9's and Tommy's with this rap shit
Sosa bitch shawty with this rap shit

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
All my niggaz thirsty for this rap shit
Kush grown and I'm with a thick bitch
I kill these niggaz dead in this rap shit
I bend these niggaz dead in this rap shit
All my niggaz reckless and get hectic
So don't be no dummy cus' I'm rappin'
My niggaz down, my niggaz fuck this rap shit
And not ever change cus' I'm rappin'
So don't get me confused with this rap shit
Buying TEC-9's and 30's with this rap shit
Louis, Gucci, got it all off of rappin'
I killed these niggaz dead in this rap shit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Made a lot of haters off this rap shit
Riding by myself cus' I don't trust a bitch
She gave me some head cus' this rap shit
On the road to get this bread, like traffic
And bitch I'm in the streets, I'm in traffic
Riding with my heat, I'm in traffic
A lot of bitches thirsty cus' I'm rappin'
But it's fuck a bitch, on to the next bitch
And the next bitch, next bitch

[Chorus]</pre>
