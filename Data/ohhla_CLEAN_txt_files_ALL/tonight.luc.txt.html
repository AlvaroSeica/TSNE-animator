[Jady]          I'm by the bar and you lookin' sexy (Oooh-whoa)
                Girl, what you sippin' on, girls, your drinks are on me
                Tonight (Tonight...)
[Lucky Luciano] Hold up, girl
                I like how you move when you do that there (Oh)
[Jady]          Tonight (Tonight...)
[Lucky Luciano] Hold up, girl
                I like how you move when you do that there (Oh)
[Jady]          Tonight

[Lucky Luciano]
(Verse 1)
I done bought the bar, don't worry 'bout it
I like how it look when you move ya body
Drinks on me, my black car Gotti
Let's V.I.P., it's way too crowded
Come upstairs, feel live, 
I love that smell, what's that you wearin'?
Oh, Cardier, yeah, I should have known
After this club, come follow me home
Cranberry and Belve', girl, what you drinking
I'm a order us a round and a shot of Tequila
I see ya bangin' body
Drinks on me, don't worry about it, I got it

Chorus:

(Verse 2)
I'm vallet on chrome, my paper is long
I pay for patrone, just to get you loose
Orange juice and a little grey goose
When you see my Louie shoes, I bet you choose
So what it do, I'm feeling you too
Look mighty sexy, yes you do
I'm a upgrade you, I'm already cool
In the club, with my mink on, my neck is blue
Oh, you like that beau, let's hit Cancun
I'll take ya on a seven day getaway cruise
Tell your boss you quit, you done got promoted
I'll be back off and I order another shot for ya

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
So what it's gonna be, it's about to be three
Wanna kick it with a G at a presidential suite
Order Don P and room service
Sex in the morn' before our breakfast
Ever partied like this, ever sipped on Cris
Wanna try somethin' new, come see how I live
What it is, girl, I know you like it
Make ya next move, ya best move, don't you fight it
Let go
I know you in a zone
Grouped on my game, yeah, you know it's cold
Jacuzzi and a fireplace to keep you hot
If you want it, I'll give it to ya, I won't stop

Repeat Chorus Twice</pre>
