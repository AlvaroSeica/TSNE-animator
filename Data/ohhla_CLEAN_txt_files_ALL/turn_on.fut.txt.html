[Intro]
I'm lookin for her {*echoes*}
I'm lookin for her, for her, for her, for her

[Future]
I'm lookin for her, yeah
Is that her, in the V.I.P. line?
With the Vuitton, and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive the Nissan, now she in a Beemer
I don't want her, cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beemer was a loner; her old man the owner
And I don't even drink Coronas, what type of drink you want bruh?
On champagne forever, on dirty Sprite forever
You can come sip with me, if you'd like to change the weather
If you wanna live better, we can buy a crib wherever
Don't get too thirsty, get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see her 'fore I do, tell her I wish that I've met her

[Chorus]
Turn on the lights; I'm lookin for her too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain't gon cheat and she gon' never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need her, she come through
Turn on the lights! I'm lookin for her, I'm lookin for her
I'm lookin for her
Turn on the lights! I'm lookin for her, I'm lookin for her
I'm lookin for her

[Future]
I'm lookin for her - send her my way
Tell her I've been lookin for her in the broad day
Hangin with the dope boys in the hallways
And I know, to keep her yeah you gotta get that pay
Turn on the lights; I'm lookin for her too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin
And if I get her number you know I can't wait to dial it
And if we get together girl you know we gon' be wildin
And when we get together we make magic and it's ours
Whenever you up here ain't na'an nobody can do about it

[Chorus]

[Future]
I'm lookin for her - she a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been misled
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy, to take control of me
I've tried to go to sleep, and seen her in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'ma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send her to me
And tell her I've been lookin for her, with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin cause I got my cash right
And tell her if she honest, and promise to stay true
Make sure when you tell her, tell her we goin past the moon

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm lookin for her {*repeat to fade*}</pre>
