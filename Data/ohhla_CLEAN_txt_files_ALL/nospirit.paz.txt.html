[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah...
I don't know why y'all scared now, this ain't a new game
Christians been rapin children over in Ukraine
I don't indulge in small talk, it's only true pain
I don't divulge the plan ock, I fuck with Hussein
Acid is fallin from the sky, fuck a new reign
This is a flammable liquified gas, butane
Muggs gave me audio heroin, hit the blue vein
I ain't even Vinnie no more, Evil my new name
I'm like Elijah Muhammad carryin thoughts afar
Laws of nature are mathematical thougts of god
I'm taking everything lettin you faggot authors starve
War criminals are becoming the arbiters of law
And y'all are fouler than swallowin pork
Real talk, free speech under foreign assault
And y'all are buryin your head in the dirt
The +Heavy Metal King+ hold big shit, hit your head with the lock

[Chorus: Sick Jacken]
This shit is (raw) the Jedi Mind's (raw)
It's war with the metaphor and you ain't seen a storm before
You ain't 'Pac, get the fuck out of the underground floor
It's over, homey you ain't got no love anymore
Do it (raw) the Psycho Realm's (raw)
This war's gonna end all, you ain't seen a storm before
I ain't takin this shit no more
We approach with a white skull when we assassinatin y'all (SOUL~!)

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm the father of anything that's been done before
I was sparrin with you I ain't even begun the war
I like darkness, I don't know what the sun is for
Y'all have small hammers, y'all must be the son of Thor
Don't need hands, telepathically the gun'll draw
That's the reason that you motherfuckers is runnin for
I saw the angel Gabriel y'all who we comin for
Y'all occupied the same hell when I confronted y'all
I can ascend without any physical death
I can repent without any physical breath
To me it's not a discussion it's invisible chess
And if the vodka not Russian it ain't hittin the chest
I can talk about guns, drugs, deadin your shit
I can talk about the Torah and dimensional shifts
The power of the almighty is what's sent through my lips
The power of the almighty when the sentinel spits

[Chorus]

[Vinnie Paz]
I'm the complete rapper, the 7th son of the beast master
My heart is bigger than anyone and it beats faster
I'm a fuckin king, gettin better with each chapter
Kiss the fuckin ring, you'd better agree bastard
A "Sucker MC" like the +D.M.C.+ classic
I'm not a fuckin star yet, but the seed planted
Energy of Godhead, Vinnie P tantric
I'm capable of levitatin and speak Sanskrit
Yeah, and that's all part of the perfect machine
Part of perfect precision, part of the perfect regime
Part of purpose and the part of the work on my Deen
Perform wudhu make selat now the surface is clean
Everything meticulous Vinnie work is pristine
Fuck with me you'll take a trip under earth with the queen
I give a fuck about a critic I'm searchin for cream
My shit is filled with hollow tips so it bursts in ya spleen

[Chorus]</pre>
