[Timbaland - Intro Repeat 3 1/2X]
I'm outta time and all I got is 
four minutes, fikki fikki four minutes - EY!
I'm outta time and all I got is 
four minutes, fikki fikki four minutes - EY!

I'm outta time and all I got is 
four minutes, fikki fikki eru, eru, c'mon
Ah..yeah
Hah...Breakdown, c'mon!

[Justin Timberlake]
Hey, uh, c'mon
Madonna..

[Madonna]
C-C-C'mon boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll
Uh...

[Justin Timberlake]
Uh, well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll
Uh, mmm...

[Madonna] 
I want somebody, to speed it up for me 
then take it down slow
There's enough room for both..

[Justin Timberlake] (Timbaland)
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where this at
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?
(Fikki, fikki, fikki, fikki, fikki, fikki, c'mon)

[Madonna + Timberlake]
If you want it
You already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
say the word and I'ma give you what you want

[Chorus: Madonna (Justin Timberlake)]
The time is waiting...
(We only got four minutes to save the world!)
No hesitating...
Grab a boy (then grab a girl!)
Time is waiting...
(We only got four minutes to save the world!)
No hesitating...
(We only got four minutes, heh a-four minutes)

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake] (Madonna)
So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri--hey--Madonna
Uh, you gotta get in line, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri--hey--Madonna
Uh, you gotta get in line, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

[Madonna] (Timbaland)
(Fikki fikki, eruh)
Sometimes I think, what I need,
is a you intervention..
Yeaaah..

[Justin Timberlake]
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move
Ohhh..hey

[Madonna]
The road to hell is paved with good intentions..
Yeaaaah..

[Justin Timberlake]
But if I die tonight 
At least I can say, I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?
(Fikki, fikki, eruh)

[Madonna + Timberlake]
If you want it
You already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want (c'mon)
If you feel it, it must be real just
say the word and I'ma give you what you want

[Chorus + Interlude]

[Timbaland - Outro]
Breakdown..
Yeah..
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock...)
Yeah..
Uh...
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock...)
I only got four minutes...
to save the world...
