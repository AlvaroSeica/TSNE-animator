Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You were fuckin penny pencha I'd never give a incha
Short arms and deep pockets be sure to lock it real special
You wont go drivein through our neighborhood you're fuckin
STAAAAAAAAALE!!!
Your women wait on you to sleep
then sneak out on a creep and come back home and kiss you
Leave some nut on you're cheek because that bitch a freak
but you just fake like you asleep you're fuckin
STAAAAAAAAALE!!!
This mother fucker got a chicken neck fool ain't never earned a check
We took a watch off a deadman after a car wreck
and scam and live you're life as weak as you can you're fuckin
STAAAAAAAAALE!!!

You bitches know we gotta go but you ain't fuckin tonight
