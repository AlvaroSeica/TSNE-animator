Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Niggaz be talkin that Bonnie &amp; Clyde shit
Man, that's that movie shit
All I know how to do is keep it 100 with my dogs

I love my main piece and my side piece
Niggaz acting shavy so I'm riding with my lady dog
Hide em wherever, hide em wherever
She know it's whatever
We roll we roll we roll
We roll we roll we roll

Love a bad bitch, get a Celine on
Young Al Green get my lean on
One love, one love
I'm talking eyes illmatic for my semi-automatic
I spot it from the corner with the one, got the city high
Made Mill's label on my back
Why didn't Diddy buy?
Take that boost, something out the loo
Hopping out the trunk, bumping booze
Bad bitches, 6 inch heels
Made 6 mills
New jury set, cost me 6 deals
Count them hundreds while shorty count 20's
Shorty keep behind
It's all bad cuz he's bluntin

I love my main bitch and my side btch
Niggaz acting shady so I'm riding with my lady dog
Roof off the Rolls, feel close to God
Fuck all mileage, you married to the mafia

I love my main piece and my side piece
Niggaz acting shavy so I'm riding with my lady dog
Hide em wherever, hide em wherever
She know it's whatever
We roll we roll we roll
We roll we roll we roll

I match braces to her elbow
Platinum Chanelle when my nigga barely sell gold
Back to 5-60 was the Melrose
A nigga dug his way up out the cell ho
Now yellow tape that bitch
This girl, you be killin em, they hate that shit
Seen you on Instagram, skyin out of Switzerland
Yea ho, you turned me to a different man
Rule a book off the shelf, the wrong move
It's big business that make the small moves
On the waterfall, mark a small cruise
My bitch right, I ain't make a wrong move

I love my main piece and my side piece
Niggaz acting shavy so I'm riding with my lady dog
Hide em wherever, hide em wherever
She know it's whatever
We roll we roll we roll
We roll we roll we roll</pre>
