[dialogue from "Network"]
All I know is that first, you've got to get MAD
You've got say "I'm a human being GOD DAMN IT!"
"My life has value!!"

[Soul Khan]
I'd go by my government name, but would that sound as real?
Noah Abraham ain't exactly got that crowd appeal
So Mr. Weston, tell the people how you feel
I'm here to tread dirt on their +Network+ like +Howard Beale+
I'm mad as hell and I ain't gonna take it
I shake the hand the ancient man prayed for the rain with
You slave for the A-list to pay for yo' facelift
I put a hole in a Skrull then wait for the shapeshift
But I ain't even know what I was in the middle of
'til I was taggin autographs in a British pub
It's so cool to say that you don't give a fuck
I give it up for the people that don't get enough
I'm still readin every comment that y'all ever give
But for the record though, it's not because I'm sensitive
I don't do this shit for me, even if I disagree
I find the truth between the positive and negative
But fuck the tomfoolery, and cartoonery
You're not movin me unless you put a harpoon in me
Nah, don't pause that, I'm off that
I want a grown-up to show up whenever mom Googles me
Cause every night when my blinds get closed
my troubled mind's frozen into nightmare poses
Sometimes I get worried, that I ain't mo'
than just an oversized child with his highchair broken
My body's young but my brain's older
It's like your lil' man Soul was the Van Gogh of the Crayolas
I stopped carin if I stayed kosher
Jehova made way mo' serious shit to pray over
I'm 40 years of desert travel in some leather sandals
You soft as Tevin Campbell lighting up a scented candle
See if I put my foot down, it turns cement to gravel
You're excited, but get frightened like Jesse Spano
We don't stop when the odds are against us
So these suckers gettin dropped from the census
I ain't never made a single song for the senseless
Guilty as charged and applause for the sentence
Word on the street, Billy got his shoes jacked
'til he got a new gat, then he got his shoes back
Let me elevate how the modern dude raps
All I need is one +bar+ like "Allahu ak-"

[dialogue from "Network"]
I want you, to get up now
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs
I want you to get up right now, and go to the window
Open it, and stick your head out and yell
"I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANY MORE"
Then we'll figure out what to do
about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis
But first, get up out of your chairs
Open the window, stick your head out and yell, and say
"I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANY MORE"</pre>
