I feel where ya comin' from
You said not to use the word love too lightly
And must keep your room nice, neat and tidy
Never let the props make you feel almighty
Try and not to get depressed from the rest of society
And that it's entirely up to me
Take a swig of this fresh lemon cup of tea
Then blow off a little steam but keep some heat
Speech is weak to learn about the strong fact of feats
Stand on your feet, take a little tongue in cheek
from the freaks and then just go about your week
You say the meek shall inherit
You've got to pay dues to get some merit
Only purchase things with money you have, fuck off the credit
Stay true to you and let it flow
That is your time, I was led by the blind
Such found it hard to find much purpose
As such I'm doing the community a service
You spoke of feeling puny and nervous
This was not the first time I'd heard this
I should be frank, honest and earnest
All at the same moment, felt where you were coming from
And what you spoke of was well spoken

[FG]
You told me as a child I spoke too often
Asked too many questions without space to soften
And I felt that back then, way back when
Before I had an understanding of adult actions
Back when the leaves were green and the sky was blue
In the pictures of the world that I painted at school
I grew and learned and I learned and grew
And now I know the things I feel aren't always true
You said it had you questioning the answers of your farm-boy blues
I found that true but I felt it too
Coming from where I come from where the sun shone
To a land where the concrete streets are wed
On most occasions, now I'm facing the facts
I felt what you said about wandering down train tracks
Soul colours unite whole, I wanna feel that
But I don't feel it when you say "Keep it real black"
It's nothing to do with colours cause check me when the lights are out
It's more about this thing called real when I only feel doubt
And you ask me where is it that you belong
It's something that made me think both hard and long
And then I decided I belong where it is I'm at
Not where I'm going until I get there, can you feel that?
You said if they're pro they'll ask how your name is spelt
And I've been called Funky G, so that was mad felt
Hands dealt are made to be played to one's best
So let the cards drop and I can deal with the rest
Tests are for passing, not for turning one's backs on
And beats aren't always made simply to be rapped on
There's more than four elements and more than one genre
That's the type of shit that can come creeping up on ya
Until suddenly I find myself thinking on
Realising, damn I feel where your coming from

[Muph]
Don't lie, don't cry, don't steal
Don't express emotions you don't feel
Appeal to yourself, look after health
And experience the real wealth
Who's gonna help if you don't help yourself?
Eventually you'll melt from that negative mind frame
The accent you speak in and the one you're rhyming should be the same
Who gives a fuck about your name? Not all dames are bitches
And even the richest people can be nice
Never think just twice but several times over
Things are starting to feel real dim when I'm sober
And when is it really over? Who knows the answer to this?
And if the cancer hits, I'll wish for it to hit real quick
So I can quickly split, they say get some direction
Or you'll continue to drift, shift from place to place
Find the goal and start the race
You've looked me directly in the face
And I've heard you state that the race has begun
Right then I realised there must be a balance between seriousness and fun
I felt those words as you spoke, rapped or sung
One thought onto the table
Had me feeling a little unstable like a baby's cradle
You were able to make me see
And sometimes you even guided me to safety

I'm feeling what ya, I'm feeling what ya speaking
I'm feeling what ya, I'm feeling what ya freaking
I'm feeling what ya, I'm feeling what ya speaking
I'm feeling what ya, I'm feeling what ya freaking
I'm feeling what ya, I'm feeling what ya speaking
I'm feeling what ya, I'm feeling what ya freaking
I'm feeling what ya speaking (I'm feeling what ya speaking)
(Oi I'm feeling it, I can feel where ya coming from)</pre>
