Yeah yeah yeah
I'm back for the fifth time like Rocky
I'm in the booth at the bank and I've got my longy
I've got some weed on me, I'm about to start smoking
and get high and then win shit like Rocky
I knock out opponents, they call it a KO
On the mic Tongue never comes with the same flow
Na ah, call me Captain Insaneo
I'm so sick with it like I've been drinking Drano
But nah I'm not, I've just been puffing weed
The green-ery, the shit that's good for me
