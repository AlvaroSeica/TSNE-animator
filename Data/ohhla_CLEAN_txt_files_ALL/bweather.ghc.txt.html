In every city theres a flood
It's raining gangstas and thugs
Fiends drowning under six feet of drugs
In every city theres a flood
It's raining gangstas and thugs
Fiends drowning under six feet of drugs

[Halloway]
Im on a air broadcasting where drama happens
Ready with four caskets, gun blast, murda and car jackin'
Slugs from the Mack 10 (mack 10)
Flippin' niggas like hurricane force winds
Lock ya doors , put the kids to sleep, hit'cha lights
Cuz its gonna be a click of niggas actin' bad tanight
It's desert storm, T.S.O, so get ya shit together
Cuz we gonna piss on your parade like bad weather

[Spade]
Here come the rain here come the drain down ya block
Like April showers, ??? cuz my brain was rapid by the hour
Nigga throw my presents like a cold breeze
I'm a chopper like, likes to whipicals when I up, niggas freeze
Like the lightning of bad weather and the hurracane runnin' thangs
Fuck the shit up, tossed the shit up.
Niggas fuck wit me watch me run up
Like a storm, bitch Im coming through this muthafucka like a bomb

In every city theres a flood
It's raining gangstas and thugs
Fiends drowning under six feet of drugs
In every city theres a flood
It's raining gangstas and thugs
Fiends drowning under six feet of drugs
In every city theres a flood
It's raining gangstas and thugs
Fiends drowning under six feet of drugs
In every city theres a flood
It's raining gangstas and thugs
Fiends drowning under six feet of drugs
In every city theres a flood
It's raining gangstas and thugs
Fiends drowning under six feet of drugs</pre>
