Good morning!
Time to get up and GO TO WORK!!

I riiide on the bus, head to the city every day
I sit on the seat and dream myself away
I dream I'm on an island with that foxy lady too
But when I awaken, I must be mistaken, I'm on the avenue
Won't you take me awayyyy, and take away me
Won't you take me awayyyy, and take away me
YeahhhhhAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Alright, get off the bus!

(Too wild man, wild!!)

"That's insane, you're stupid" (Huh?)
"You should sleep late man;
 it's just much easier on your constitution"</pre>
