Yeah yeah....if niggas knew better they'll do better
(Let's just say I never came to the A-town)
Ya dig...I'm bout to make all the sense in the world right now
But the world don't make no sense so it don't matter
Ya dig....Haha!
Niggas say I'm shallow all I talk about is the streets
(Here with the mixtape for the streets)
Well I got news for you fuck niggas (talk to em Jeezy)
That's where the fuck I came from (the streets)
(Gangsta Grillz)
Hahahaha

Let's just say
I ain't talking bout the blow and work
Let's just say
I ain't talking bout the kush I burn
Let's just say
I ain't talking bout the blow and work
Let's just say
I ain't talking bout the kush I burn

(Don't nobody wanna come for the crown?)

[Hook]
Let's just say
I ain't talking bout the blow and work
Let's just say
I ain't talking bout the kush I burn
Let's just say
I ain't talking bout the money and hoes
Let's just say
I ain't talking bout the cars and clothes
(x2)

Let's just say
I ain't know what I was talking about
Let's just say
I never really lived a drought
You can't just wake up and talk like this (Naww)
You can't just wake up and walk like this (Uh-uh)
In the belly of the beast
just like the movies
My man hype naw he ain't the record (Ayyy)
You gotta be real if you tryna detect it
That's why I drop knowledge (You sense it)
Just like NAS (Haha)
The D.A.'ll have you in a place like OZ (Damn)
Oh well, just another cell (Cell)
Ain't nothing new another nigga in jail (Yep)
Two hops and a cot 
Mamma what you prayin for
Another nigga that the taxpayers payin for (Yeaaaahhhh)
You could hold your breath till your blue in the face (Ayyy)
But it don't matter they still won't open the gates (Naw)
That's real talk nigga (Ayyy)

[Hook] x2

Let's just say
I made all the sense in the world
But the world don't make no sense (Trendsetta)
We cop new cars but we still ride tints
I just copped that Charger but I want that Benz
Is it funny to you
No it's funny to me (Me)
It's all for another motherfucker to see (Yep)
Black on Black
You know how I do
So when you see me in it nigga know I bought it for you (Picture me rollin)
And iced out too this summer last summer like déjà vu (Damn)
Get money yeah that's the mission but the haters and the tabs are the obstacles (Ayyy)
I got three books and a possible (Haha)
What's the chance of a nigga goin forward
I'm focused man I had the vision (Yeah)
with my partner doin time cause he can't relive em (Gangsta Grillz)

[Hook] x2

Let's just say
We took time to think for a minute
Let's just say
We took time to blink for a minute
Time waits for no man and your girl don't either (Naww)
You in the pen now she's fuckin your friends (Damn)
Niggas don't settle down it's like they can't find pens (Ayyy)
They sell em at the same store they sell them blunts (Haha)
Oh well I guess that's life (Life)
It' don't seem wrong so I guess that's right (Yeaaaahhhhh)
But its dead wrong like my man from BK (Ayyy)
It's a one way street and your goin the wrong way (Yeah)
You know like I know you'll make that U-turn (Turn)
Tell me whatya gonna do nigga when it's your turn (Ayyy)
