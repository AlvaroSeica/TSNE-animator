[Childish Gambino]
Welcome to the culdesac, this is where the street ends
I am just a rapper, I ain't got the time for speakin
Nigga stay weak like tornado and a tree branch
I never have a weak day, my life's a long weekend
Fuckin with you raw bitch, my mouth should get tested
Sleepin on a nigga, hope you feel well rested
Gambino stay on, can't nobody pull the cord out
A nigga fucked up, like a hang gliding whore house
Sick boy, yeah the clique on deck
Yes I rap absurd, got the game upset
And they rap about the jewelry, the weed they smoke
And I rap about my life and niggaz think it's a joke, nah
I only put real on a nigga
Bitches see the money, try and steal on a nigga
Yes I'm on fire, you can feel it on a nigga
Step away from the +Heat+, they Shaquille'n on a nigga
Treat niggaz like pussy go hard on 'em
Watch the swagga get swiped like a card bought 'em
The swag's unique, I don't even worry 'bout 'em
I got the tortoise shell frames and the argyle
You wouldn't think from the things I'm fashionin
I'd get more bush than Kim Kardashian
Drop hot shit, yeah my mouth's a laxative
Born to be the greatest, this is not by accident

[Chorus]
Hey player, what's good? Let me dope you
Hey hater, what's hood? Let me dope you
I'm on fire like wood - let me dope you
And you don't wanna fuck with dude - let me dope you
"Don't start no shit, there won't be no shit" - Lil Jon {*4X*}

[Childish Gambino]
I'm a genius, I ain't gotta fake shit
My cup runneth over, you can take sips
I'm in a spa, white robe like a racist
Niggaz can't see me I will pay for your LASIK
Fuck what ya heard bitch, I'm flyer than you ever seen
My wallet make paper, call it Evergreen
Ashy to classy, finally got some Vaseline
Live inside a sauna cause I always got my self-e-steam
Name in your mouth, and it seems as though I struck a nerve
I never fit in like my penis in these tiny girls
I figured I was different from these other guys
When I wrote for 30 Rock, I was under 25
These other rappers wanna fade into the background
I'ma stand out when these niggaz done sat down
I always pack heat, yeah my mouth need a pat down
Money, girls, clothes I don't worry about that now

[Chorus]</pre>
