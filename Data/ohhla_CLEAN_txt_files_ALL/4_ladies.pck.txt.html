[Lil Uno]
my girl she somethin special, somethin epic like in the movie
feel me

my girl like magic, she can make it dissapear
hold it down, she hold me down
go the round, she love to box
In the park, long walks, some cream like a dope spot
I'm a mommas boy you know she daddys little girl
a down ass chick and a swag real cool
dress real different she can hold a conversation
remind me of a lady so I told her be patient

[Chorus]

[Young Stunna]

but I promise if you come it could be the time of your life
stunna man, come on
Infatuation, thats an understatement

addiction come first then your heart start racin

I take you to the stars, while we puff on this grape shit

[Chorus]</pre>
