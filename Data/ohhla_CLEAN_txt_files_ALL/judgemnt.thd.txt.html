[Intro: The D.O.C. talking]
It's Judgement Day
"you know what I'm sayin, if any one got sick"
"30 day 61

[Verse 1: Six Two]
Total choas, Outlast, mass confusion
Dead woods is cruising for bruisings
labelled me sick, Six Two is livin' psychopathic fit
some people think I'm loony and the range "uh ha"
because I come in these murders at the point blank range (*Gun Shot*)
bowdown, I'm aimin' at your face
murder one did, and close casket case
outlast war, now leave me alone
this hollow points'll give you piss on and fuck up your arm
fool, I'll drops the bomb
casualties packed up and stacks like you numb
my G lock don't see them on the stock
four dead wood, left for dead in the donut shop
It's time to tear the roof off this mothafucker
and got no love for these suckers and bad busters......

[Chorus: The D.O.C.]
in Judgment Day
don't you get caught slippin' without your AK

[Break: Six Two]
I touched down at the L.A. X
okey, bitch don't ever mix, Two Face and Dr. Dre

[Dr. Dre]
welcome to Califor-nia, my nigga
the home of palm trees and sticky green killers

[Verse 2: The D.O.C.]
I hit the city G-ed up "for real"
and let's get this understood, I'm good for two or three meals
deeply thinkin' while I'm rollin, smokin' and drinkin'
The D.O.C. you know it ain't easy been me
that been through the whole nine and still tickin'
this is genocide on mine, let's be realistic
if he don't get what he supposed, this subject to go ballistic
Two Face'll leave the mothafucker twisted
watch your mouth, y'all niggaz don't even know me but you owe me
don't be like these foes, you'll catch a dawn kal homey
that's all I can say my nigga, case's closed
now let's go and get this paper my nigga and chase hoes.......

[Chorus: The D.O.C.]
in Judgment Day
don't you get caught slippin' without your AK
don't you get caught slippin' without your AK

[Verse 3: The D.O.C.]
I touched down from outta no where, ready to catch a case
the Gorilla goes bannas with a solid black bandana on his face
his tattoo says ain't one cheat
Two Face the bitch killer, all eyes on me
I do my dirt in the broad day, with the AK
till the all deceased, me hear R.I.P's
see my mentality is totally fucked up
I'ma time bomb tickin' ready to self destruct
I do this till I'm satisfied, y'all ain't heard
I goes bows on bitches, they said cause the hood in a eard
havin' suicidal thoughts in my room
don't hestitate to put the .44 to your dome
damn (*Gun Shot*).........

[Outro: The D.O.C. talking]
don't you get caught slippin' without your AK
senicerely your Mr. Two Face
don't you get caught slippin' without your AK
senicerely your Mr. Two Face</pre>
