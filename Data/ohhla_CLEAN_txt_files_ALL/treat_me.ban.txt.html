[Intro]
We givin you FUCK boys

(Five minutes, bitch!) David Banner, BME Click
Big Face (Big Face), Yeah Big Face, motherfucker
We got Jadakiss, and Ruff Ryders in this motherfucker!
Yeah, let's go!

[Chorus: David Banner]
I ain't gon' let nair nigga treat me like a bitch! (Like a bitch!)
I ain't gon' let nair nigga play me like a bitch! (Like a bitch!)
I ain't scared of that nigga! I ain't scared of that bitch!
We'll crush everybody and they motherfuckin clique!!
I ain't gon' let nair nigga treat me like a bitch! (Like a bitch!)
I ain't gon' let nair nigga play me like a bitch! (Like a bitch!)
I ain't scared of that nigga! I ain't scared of that bitch!
We'll crush everybody and they motherfuckin clique!!

[David Banner]
Let's get to it, ya bitch! We in the club, it ain't a thang
Two tons through the backdo', lookin for you lames
Oh mayne it's a shame, I'm throwed in the game
I act like I'ma fight you then I'm blowin out yo' brains
You talk-talk shit, but you ain't gon' do nothing to Lavell
I returned from hell, nigga, like YEA! YEA! YEA!
Bloody body and all (all!), limpin, grippin my balls (my balls!)
Hope your clique is with you nigga, cause I'm killin 'em all!
I'ma vic 'em, you pick 'em up, crush 'em, bus' 'em like cans
Mississippi's my land (YEA!), with my dick in my hand (YEA!)
I been ready to die, put your guns in the sky
Pop it back, pull the trigger, watch a bullet go fire

[Chorus]

[David Banner]
I know you hooooes hate my pimpin, pimpin 
Pimpin... but I took yo' bitch!
Is that the real reason why you hate my clique?
Them 24s' spinnin make you so sick (ugh!)
And I don't even floss like that, but I will put
fo' or five bullets in yo' back - walk now!
A pistol in yo' mouth, bitch boy talk now!
I used to get no love, now ya girl stalks now!
Is it that 106 &amp; Park pimpin? Is it those MTV looks?
Is it Lil' Jon screamin on the hooks? (YEAAAH!)
Is it that tour bus spread? Is it fuckin these stars?
Or me gettin head from yo' bitch in the BACK OF THE CAR, nigga!

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
AH-HAAAH!
Aiyyo, I don't like to promise shit, but we gon' bring the drama kid
Just tell me who I gotta slap and where they momma live (where they at?)
And yet and still, real recognize real
And whoever don't get recognized get killed
Too many soldiers that jeopardize in the field
I got throwaway niggaz ready to die in they will
Jason as a youth, I turned into Satan in the booth
First nigga with Daytons on the coupe, uh
I could drive but a boss get driven
So my shotgun higher than the cost of living
My seat back, my gear black, my heat black
Deserve whatever you got comin, so keep that
(Keep it) Now all you do is turn the lights off
and drive by slow, I'ma turn his life off (Ah-hah~!)
Then I'm good, long as he bleedin
Nair nigga'll never play me long as I'm breathing, what!
