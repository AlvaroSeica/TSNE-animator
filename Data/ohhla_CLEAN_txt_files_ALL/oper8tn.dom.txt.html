[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, just got back...
Tackle these niggas, man
The season's mine, hang it up, nigga
It's Dom P., rocking his jersey hard
Napalm, to the fullest, man
To the fullest, man, Staten Island, man
You heard me? You fucking heard me? Yo

[Dom Pachino]
Catch me easing through the p's slow, P's back, yo
Blowing trees, ease back bro
Keep my pockets on puff, cuz they need that dough
Performer of the year, like I need that show
I could leave a bitch quick, don't need that ho
I'm tracking daily, like these beats need my flow
Check my record, I'm the most active
Stay busy like the New York City night
Describe my music; grimey, gutter my shit; gritty like
Getting paper is the most high, look at me I dress fly
And I drive by in a Series Six, used to be an S5
Baby girl, hop in, do you wanna test drive?
Roll with this rapping cat, so we can get it popping
Sort of like your bra strap, by the way my name is Dom P.
And this is what I'm getting that

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
This is Operation Warface
I bring my soldiers to a huddle and we take over the whole place
Operation Warface
I bring my soldiers to a huddle and we take over the whole place
Operation Warface
I bring my soldiers to a huddle and we take over the whole place
Napalm Team, Napalm Team

[Chapel]
Aiyo, aiyo, as a young man, I think about my major plans
I'm a conquer this land, everybody get ganked
Take a look at my face, I need an eye exam
I got a warface, smash ya'll, Chap's advance
Leave you bloody like a hundred fifty MaxiPads
Best know we raw deal, when the mic in my hands, now
Who the angriest, real deal dangerous
Mark you up brutally, no this ain't painless
Metal in your mouth, I ain't talking bout braces
My team shine amongst these tough stages
Tell you how it is, never asking no favors
Always on point like guns on red lasers
Never could you doubt these, arm fire phases
Majorly I'm printed on the pace, ya'll play strangers
Never did I think I, could write so many bangers
Well, guess what, I proved myself wrong amongst changed

[Chorus]

[Outro: Dom Pachino]
Yo, man, give a shout out, crazy dookie phat shout out, man
To all my soldiers, man, that fuck with Napalm and Dom Pachino
Youknowhatimean? Word up, man, no NLZ-ito, my nigga NLZ, The War Machine
Just Da Barber, my brother, youknowhatimean? Know how we do, man
Yo, Jess The Bandit, that's how we get down, Rockwell, what's up baby?
Chapel, Chapizzy, what the fuck son? You know how we do
Shyheim, Thirstin Howl, Block McCloud, all my niggas that rep hard, yo
Staten Island, yo, Killarmy, Killa Sin locked down, that's how we do,
baby pa, you heard me?
Beretta 9, Shogun the Assason, Islord, uh-huh, uh-huh
That's my team, man, that's how we do it, Napalm is hard
We wrecking shop, all my Brazilian niggas, yo Feda what up?
Fabrizio, Marko, Sacramento, how doing son? Queens
The Boogie Down, yo, Staten Island, Uptown, Harlem
Where you at, yo?</pre>
