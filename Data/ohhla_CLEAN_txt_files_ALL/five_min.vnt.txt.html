[Vents]
Yeah! I got nothing but a lot of resent and an utter contempt
Waiting for a scumbag something like a hundred percent
Fucking with Vents, fucking with Ses', fucking with Pegz
Obese and all of that, nothing but friends
Nothing but love, rough in the ruggedest form
Centigrade heat keep the mic kind of warm
We born to live a life to die so I find
the right way to jet, no pain and regret
Waving the black and the red, justice and peace
More getting along and less fucking police
Cooking dope over wonderful beats
My reputation like Cold Crush Brothers when it come to the beefs
I keep no respect for a man that talk
to his mother like a bitch and sell drugs to kids (word 'em up)
You ain't the hard type
You a chicken shit bitch-made retard sucking that glass pipe

[Chorus]
That's why I don't trust nobody but me
Everybody squabbling about nothing look funny to me
It's five minutes to midnight
You wanna fight about skin colour? Gonna be a long hot summer
Don't trust nobody but me
Everybody out waving those flags look funny to me
It's five minutes to midnight
You wanna fight about this bullshit? Get your card pulled quick

[Vents]
I got nothing but a lack of respect for a fucker
that sending men to war, so the damn unleaded can pour
I got nothing but hate for a man with a corporate dick
so far in his date, he's shitting out yellowcake
Nobody get a break unless you make
the kind of loot that the fast food generate
Eat a Big Mac? I'd rather eat a piece of shit
smeared off of Adolph's dick
You picked the wrong rapper to fuck with
The world like Yorkshire '79 and I'm Sutcliffe
And I'ma bust with maniacal rage
while my man here scratch like he dying of AIDS, huh!
From the padded room to the catacomb
living in a vacuum, then back to the maggots soon
Back to the dust in a rush
Vents in effect, see you in the next lifetime bruz, what up?!

[Chorus]

[Vents]
I got a whole lot of love for my real mates
Mr. Trials in effect yelling rage at the kids and it feel great
I got love for my girl Kate
I know it's hard for you but every day like my birth date
And every snake get the finger
We could take the ruckus outside like Meninga
Sicker than Maralinga, I'm the bringer of justice
Hardcore dissidence, what the fuck is this?
Vents One, Hard to Kill, bars of steel
Rhyme foul like a gram and a half a pill
Got love for the young guns playing my noise
Rhyming like Vents, slaying them toys
Making that choice to get smart
Even thought school is a factory line and you the next part
Much love for my mates
Much grief and torment forever to the down low snakes

[Chorus]</pre>
