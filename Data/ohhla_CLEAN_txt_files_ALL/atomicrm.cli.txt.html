[Intro:]
[Coolio] This is a story of a famous dog
[George] But the dog that chases it's tail; will be dizzy
[George] It's a clapping dog
[Coolio] Harmonic dog
[George] Rhythmic dog
[Coolio] Rapid dog
[George] Funky dog
[Coolio] Puppet dog
[George] House dogs, Street dogs
[Coolio] Dogs of the World Unite!

[Chorus: George Clinton]
Bow wow wow, yippie-yo-yippie yeah
Bow wow yippie-yo-yippie yeah

[Coolio]
Bow wow wow, yippie-yo-yippie yeah
It ain't Snoop Dogg, but I'm still a hog
It's Coolio loc, full bailing out the alley
Representing West Coast, Compton Cali'
Til the hoochies in the cities and the DMI trays
And the homies hitting the corners in a Deuce old trey
Now, give it up for the Funkadelic group
Decade and a half still bumping in a Coup√©

[Shorty]
So why must I, feel like that?
And fill up the room with funking raps
Bumping out nine six, on atomic mix
Moving and grooving, you and your trick
And I recognize, it's a new generation 'til I die
It's still One Nation, Under a Groove
Nobody moves, as the Funky Ten Dues that tone (Ruff!!)

[Hook #1: Parliament Funkadelics]
Atomic dog!! Atomic dog!!
Like the boys; when you're out there on the streets
May compete, nothing but the dog in me
Bow wow wow, yippie-yo-yippie yeah
Bow wow yippie-yo-yippie yeah
Bow wow wow, yippie-yo-yippie yeah
Bow wow yippie-yo-yippie yeah

[Shorty]
There'll be wide clientele, lick my balls
Shorty, Coolio and the O.G. Dog
Roll like Parliament baselines
And I bought me a Vibe on the Frankenstein
My rhymes, intertwine, like Zingers
Hey Man... Smell My Finger!
We bring you; fourteen years of funk that's hard
No Speed Stick and no wright Ford

[Coolio]
We used to roll on Greatest, now we play Saga
And dipped in the Five-O low gold Daytons
A noble in a Lexus got his eye on the cat
And in case they didn't understand why the dog likes that (Ruff!!)
Flashlights on, cause no one knows
When the nose flows, when the door is closed
Funkadelity, what you're telling me?
A-T-L with my C. D-O-G - Funk!

[Hook #2: Parliament Funkadelics]
Like the boys; when you're out there on the streets
May compete, nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that?
Oh, why must I!!! CHASE THE CAT?
Like the boys; when you're out there on the streets
May compete, nothing but the dog in ya
Ruff!! Ruff!! Ruff!!

[Interlude: Parliament Funkadelics X4]
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Nothing but the dog in me
Nothing but the dog in me

[Parliament Funkadelics]
I'm working nine to five my duty to do the.. DOG!
Do the dogcatcher, do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher.. DOG!
Do the dogcatcher, do the dogcatcher, dogcatcher.. DOG!
Do the dogcatcher, baby, do the dogcatcher.. DOG! Ooh

[Interlude: Parliament Funkadelics X2]
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Nothing but the dog in me
Nothing but the dog in me

[Outro: George Clinton]
Bow wow wow, yippie-yo-yippie yeah
Bow wow wow, yippie-yo-yippie yeah
Bow wow, yippie-yo-yippie yeah
Just walking the dog! - my atomic dog!!
Just rock and you don't stop, just do it, feel the beat
Just rock and you don't stop, just do it, feel the beat
Just rock and you don't stop, just do it, feel the beat
Yeaaahhhh, yeaaaahhhh, yeaaahhhhh, yeaaah</pre>
