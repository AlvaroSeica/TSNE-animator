Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Young Nigga, chasin' millions
Took advantage of the blessings I was givin', lord
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison (I thought that I be dead or in prison)

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
I used to wanna coop and a thick bitch
Now all I see is dead presis, got a sixth sense
Everyday I'm on a block I'm thinking: "this' sick"
My Nigga outta town showed me how to flip bricks
He said: "Fuck this rap shit, this how you get rich"
They watching for that dirty money, I can't spend shit
I gotta feed the fam
I came up with a plan
I need some extra hands to help me move all these grams, foreal
They see a young nigga stuntin, now they want you killed
Gotta watch out for these youngins, tryna pay their bills
I swear to god I liked it better back when I was broke
I'm paranoid, I gotta keep my eyes on all these folks
Never been a fool
Ridin' with the tool
Early in the morning, taking nephew to school
They say I changed, I swear I'm the same dude
Everything the same, I just change how I move, haah

[Chorus x2: Lil Bibby]
Young Nigga, chasin' millions
I took advantage of the blessings I was givin', lord
I thought that I be dead or in prison
They told me I be dead or in prison

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
My big brother prolly be somewhere up in the feds
My lil brother prolly be somewhere in jail or dead
Thank god a nigga used his head
I was stuck off in the slump just tryna get ahead
I was just like you
But I - seen a way out then what I do
I had to put my mind to it
Niggas kept hatin
But I had to grind through it
Bitch, I define music
I ain't quit when shit got hectic
I did it on my own, niggas gotta respect it
And this shit for my young niggas, in the hood with no father
The shit I seen in these streets encouraged me to go harder
And this shit is off the top, my phone died, I got no charger
Keep it real with yourself, I promise you, you will go farther
And these niggas didn't believe me
But now the whole world need me

[Chorus]</pre>
