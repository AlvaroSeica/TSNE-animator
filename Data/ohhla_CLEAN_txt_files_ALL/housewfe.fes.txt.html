Song:   House Wife Ho
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
A ho is a ho, and a house wife to
You never know what a house wife do
When them doors close, lights out to
But if you had a chance, you would wife that to

[Fes Taylor]
Baby, you know I'm still down for you
And loving you, is all I know how to do
So if it's out of you, or my ex-broad
I left force, so me and you can score like a chess board
Sex four hours, get it wet more, kinda like
Fish in the pet store, yes lord, press pause
I don't wanna nut yet, sweat pour, G5
I beat it up, mama, then I jet off
But you something different, so I stuck around
Tours out in Brazil, and I ain't even fuck around
Gotta be love, something that I never feel
With an ass like that, I turn my head around
But did a second glance, I know, if I fucked up
I get a second chance, it's like the second hands
Ticking on the clock slower, I should of realized
Thinking that it's not over, just trying to kill time
Driving in the box Rover, thinking I feel fine
Drinking on distilled wine, I made a mil', signed
Still got shit on my mind, chills up my spine
Can't find peace at home, so I slide
Trying to substitute shit I don't get at the crib
Like, I already gave you a ring
And all I ask for, is you clean out your closets and backdoors
Then why you trying to catch me wit trap doors, what's that for?

[Chorus]

[Sassy]
A thug is a thug, he gon' do what he gon' do
I'm far from a ho, I just play the game to

[Mr. Prezident]
I think we heading down different paths, but that ain't in my plans
I'm bout getting cash, ma, you can kiss my ass
I gotta hit the ave, hard body, pinching slabs
Plus I'm noticing lately, you been tripping bad
Look I ain't getting mad, we can be friends though
Dumb ass you went from a Porsche to a pencil
Got me thinking something wrong wit ya mental
Peace and upgrade, guess you ain't get the memo
Let's not pretend, though, ma, you know my M.O.
I smashed everything from N.Y. to N.O.
It's all X.O.'s, tug of war, best though
You keep pulling on the rope, I let go
Let go, coke told you my out right
Pops said you can't turn a ho into a house wife

[Chorus]</pre>
