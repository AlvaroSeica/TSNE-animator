Insight [Mr Lif] {T-Ruckus}

Its finished!
Its finally tuned up
Technical tweezes have
Tightened the loose nuts
[Now we can remove cuts as soon as they move up]
{Ruck's in the back with the ax for the cuts
Removing their bones to build thrones in the dungeon
Hungry from war Dead bodies get bludgeoned}
Gun em!
[Examine the Pulse Cannon
The result of diligent planning
Serving the area site]
Now scanning four hundred soldiers
Approaching the landing
{Their family's abandoned,
They're on a fool's quest
Organs liquify from a blast in the chest
This hardly a test for my
Power cosmic bomb shit
Trauma an absence of logic
It's what they displayed
Motherfuckers fillet
And the blood of ten men
On the end of my blade}
They try to invade
[We slight from their raid]
{An aura of death}
[From the suckers we sprayed]

(Chorus)(All Three)
Ready, Set
Aim, Fire!
Burn, Turn
Salute, March
Charge, Launch
Tally, Pull
Devestating Energy
[Behold]
(2X)

Feel the fluctuating blast of
Concentrated energy
A deadly dose of shock churn through the enemy

[Potentially]
Paralyzing
[Damages]
Resonance
[The effects are evident]
{I terrorize infinitely
Exert myself minimally
Certain death is the penalty}
Revive 'em
[Clear]
We got a pulse here
{Ready on the left}
[I'll prick through his right ear]
Now give him his nightmare
[Terror]
{Got him!}
To be sure that I stop him
I chop the ??corpus collosum??
[The enemy claims]
{Their power was awesome}
Toss 'em in the moat
{[Their body float]}
[They're panicking 'cause their is no hope]
{Po's beam reflecting off my [Chainmail coat]}
The sergeant is done
Slam the commander
{Body count taken we're burn downin' banner}
[They didn't understand the incredible force]
{[Knights Of The Round Table]}
[They battled and lost]

(Chorus)

{*Statik Selectah skratches*}
"Bodies may have been hurtled by the blast"
"When the building collapsed"
"Damage" "Casualties"
"Fire disaster" (sound of a building collapsing)</pre>
