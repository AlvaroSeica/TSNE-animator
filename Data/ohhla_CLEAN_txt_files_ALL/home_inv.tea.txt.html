[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, yeah, Napalm, Napalm, Napalm, Napalm
Knowhatimsaying? Coming for that dough, nigga, yo

[Dom Pachino]
When I kick in the door, wave in the four-four
All I wanna know is where ya'll niggas keep the raw
Where ya'll keep it, in the floor, or ya'll keep it in the wall
All I know you keep enough of it, I'm bout to run a store
Pass it off to my soldiers, then I'm out on tour
Tearing roofs off hip hop, strictly hardcore
Is the Team that'll run through towns, lock shit down
Fucked every bitch around, that's how we get down
That's great promotion, for this rap shit, great devotion
Rub it on your skin like lotion, bitch
I'm approaching, rich, you a spokesman, you snitch

[Chorus: Dom Pachino]
I know that dough's in here
I know that blow's in here
I can smell it, you gon' tell it
But you gon' get it, I'm so sincere

[Dom Pachino]
When I kick in doors, like Biggie, wave the mack milly
Silly son, wash that shit, a slug just missed me
Don't piss me off, I lay down the bluleprint lovely
If it, go disaccordingly, it's gon' get ugly
Got, big guns in here, the size of bazookas
Got my, niggas outside, they dying to shoot cha
Cuz you fucked up all my money, ain't a, damn thing funny
Told ya ass once before, don't take nothing from me

[Chorus]

[Outro: Dom Pachino]
It's Napalm, kid... the new generation, word up
Napalm Recordings, kid... it's the label
You talking to the fucking CEO, nigga
Word up... militant for life</pre>
