( Lil Italy )

Whussup? This Lil Italy here with Ghetto Commision yeah and that's power

My life styles on of the illest
I went from pimpin to jacking to candy dealing
And now I'm on a mission to start commiting
Filthy loot lacing out the fucking ceiling
Everybody want to know how Lil Italy feeling
Payin dues I can't lose if I make the right moves
See this is major league ball
So I had to get the Ghetto Commision to pull the shit of thick like fog
We put the weight on all you busters
And only fuck with real hustlers
Something that I can't get enough of
Hanging out the pestros side jump ( jump)
Man that chopper be spinning that really saying something
Now that's power

( Lil Italy/Ghetto Commision )

GC: when every little nigga want to be
LI: now that's power
GC: to run the fucking city that don't sleep
LI: now that's power
GC: when you got Johnny Cocharn on your team
LI : now that's power
GC: one phone call could put a nigga life in danger

( Ghetto Commision )

Say woodie ask yourself you quit working with that power
Kicking a mob of 15 in less than an hour
A quick lunatic that would see to devour
Choppers bullets and bus once back respect's ours
First came the money from the royalty
They sayin oh gc came up ? ?? ?
It's all about the loot
the cabbage the cream
Holla at me I'm with the power living the street dream

Rat a tat boom blocka blocka
Niggas breaking they neck ducking and running cause they spread with the
chopper
I done lost my fucking mind again
To much smoke not enough oxgyen
To many joes to many heinekens
And in my mind it says fuck em all stay born
Till you fall stay to the west bank
to the bank we gonna paper chase
Take over and dominate and ya'll bitches gone learn
Lil Italy and the commision with power to take yours

( Lil Italy/Ghetto Commision )

LI: now that's power
GC: come along and take down a niggas shop
LI: now that's power
GC: take that same shop and make it into your dope spot
LI: now that's power
GC: hustle a day late and never get caught
LI: now that's power
GC: to get caught and have the fuckin judge bought

( Ghetto Commision )

It's best you tape me down
Flip me over
Cut my wrist
Break my shoulders
But I still remain in strength cuz I'm a no limit soldier
Been laced with this game
Weez the niggas with this flame
Niggas best respect the man or get caught up in the rain
This is Holloway
Ghost in the dark in this niggas heart
I get's my regards and get bitch niggas of my tots
My entourge is holligans from the bay to the boot
They constagate from out the hoot them we aim and we shoot
You see I leave niggas dyin for tryin fucking with mine
I'm dusting that iron
That nickle plated nine bitch I'm busting with me
You may not see me but I'm coming like a blizzard
Christmas bout to miss ya when you fucking with this nigga

( Lil Italy/Ghetto Commision )
