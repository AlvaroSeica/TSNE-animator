[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, make some noise, give it up ya'll
You got Ghostface Killah in the building
Ya'll in the presence of greatness right now
Make some noise, we got Jackson Browne
We got Jewel, give it up for Mr. Lyle Lovett in the house
We here to honor the original hard walker
Mr. Dewey Cox, give the Cox his props

[Lyle Lovett (Jewel) {Jackson Browne} *Lovett &amp; Browne* <all>]
Walk hard (hard) {down life's} *rocky road*
Walk bold (hard) {that's my creed} *my cloak*
(I've been scorned and slandered and ridiculed too)
Had to struggle everyday my whole life through
{Seen the share of the worst this world can give}
<but a="" and="" burnin="" dream="" got="" i="" rage="" still="" too="">

[Jewel &amp; Lyle Lovett (Lyle Lovett) {Jewel}]
Walk hard, hard, when they say you're all done
Walk bold, hard, when they say, you're not the one
(Even if you've been told time and time again
That you're always gonna lose and you're never gonna win)
{You gotta keep that rhythm in your mind's eye}
When you're standing on top of the mountain high

[Ghostface Killah]
Walking hard, I'm a real hard walker
Fast in a trick, and a smooth talker
My guns pop out like a jack in the box
I cut you in half like Dewey Cox
A guilty gangsta, guilty as charged
Shank in my hand, ice man behind bars
Out of my way, I'll bring you down
No one's safe, not even Jackson Browne
My skin stay scarred, you can ask God
Lots of ladies unsnap their bras
Ask Lyle Lovett, I had sex on Mars
Thats how we do it when we walk hard
How do I walk? Hard as a stone
How do I walk? Hard like a bone
How do I walk? Like a jackhammer tool
How do I walk? Harder than Jewel
Tell me how we walk, hard, hard, hard, hard

[Browne, Jewel &amp; Lovett]
When I meet my maker, I'ma die anyday
I'm gonna look him in the eye, and by God, I'll say
I gave him my word, and my word was good
I took it in the face and walked as hard as I could
Walk hard, hard, walk haaaaaard </but></all></pre>
