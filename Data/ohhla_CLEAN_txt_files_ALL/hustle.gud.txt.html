Song:   Hustle All Day
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hustle all day and do the same thing tomorrow
I'm riding through New Orleans, but I'm head to Diora
Standing in the kitchen cooking 4 2 and the quarters
Cell phone ringing, gotta take another order
Get straight to the paper, get straight to the paper
Get straight to the paper, gotta get straight to the paper
Legend in my section, everybody know I'm balling
Try to pay for powder, but money keep calling

Riding in my whip, throwing e's out the window
If a nigga talking stupid, then I squeeze out the window
I'm a motherfucking rider, glock 40 serve me
I let them dubs fly cheap, I'm a bird dealer
If you got paper, why you standing on the curve nigga
Treal boss shit, youngest moving on my word nigga
Slick talking get you punched in your dimples
Or he gonna learn the day when he get that pop to his temple
Gudda is the name, la t big dog, the gun throwing bullets like passes
Get picked off
Grinding is the motto, bad bitches follow
But we hustle all day and we do the same thang tomorrow

Hustle all day and do the same thing tomorrow
I'm riding through New Orleans, but I'm head to Diora
Standing in the kitchen cooking 4 2 and the quarters
Cell phone ringing, gotta take another order
Get straight to the paper, get straight to the paper
Get straight to the paper, gotta get straight to the paper
Legend in my section, everybody know I'm balling
Try to pay for powder, but money keep calling

Work, free lame motor rollers a prepaid
Go hard in the paid, dishing the rock all like I'm d way
Messages getting relayed, everyday like a replay
Dice shooter gather round the table, I don't see lames
Food stamp quart on the dresser, it's for Vanessa
I just hold it for the smokers who wanna stone off a credit
Trap med to the preference, crack sellings and fetish
Thanking God for my wrist, my banks stretches for extra
Extra we talking everything, taking extra precaution
Pray for faith when I'm walking, the law on the wall can talk us
Consequences forget me, call the call for the lawyer
Hustle all day, do the same thing tomorrow

Hustle all day and do the same thing tomorrow
I'm riding through New Orleans, but I'm head to Diora
Standing in the kitchen cooking 4 2 and the quarters
Cell phone ringing, gotta take another order
Get straight to the paper, get straight to the paper
Get straight to the paper, gotta get straight to the paper
Legend in my section, everybody know I'm balling
Try to pay for powder, but money keep calling

Mister dope flow, every verse a quarter key
Yeah I pop a zam, bought it, pass the blunt a molly g
My baby mama out the 3, I will make a slice you hold
And tell your boyfriend come get a verse while the price is low
Bitch, I be on that real shit, my gun the size of a skateboard
Make you heel flip, mister underscore, brazy flow hoes violent
I rap about drugs cause I be higher than the Ollie
Gudda pop the molly, I'm sipping with luca brazzy
A 8 in the toop, that nigga be wailing
Phone call, I do this for my bloods my nigga
Loyalty amongst thieves, I love them niggas, pause

Hustle all day and do the same thing tomorrow
I'm riding through New Orleans, but I'm head to Diora
Standing in the kitchen cooking 4 2 and the quarters
Cell phone ringing, gotta take another order
Get straight to the paper, get straight to the paper
Get straight to the paper, gotta get straight to the paper
Legend in my section, everybody know I'm balling
Try to pay for powder, but money keep calling</pre>
