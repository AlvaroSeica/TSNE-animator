[Chorus: Jai Paul]
I wanna get in higher res
I wanna see it on the sick screen
I wanna get it now, anytime, anywhere
I wanna put it on five point one
I just want to get it on
I wanna get it anytime, anywhere

I wanna get in higher res
I wanna see it on the sick screen
I wanna get it now, anytime, anywhere
I wanna put it on five point one
...get it on
I wanna get it anytime, anywhere
I wanna get in higher res

[Big Boi]
1080p, now what can be clearer when your vision is blurry?
Well, I say wipin' away the steam up off the mirror
And bathin' in the fog, dog
She about this lumberjack, so she gonna get this log cause
I'mma get that thundercat when I get up under that, thang
Her natural habitat is a bang, bang, bang
Surrounded by the jungle, the sea, the tundra
B-i-g stay cooler than the pussy on a penguin in the summer
Niggas in slumber, but, we been runnin' this bitch and never fumbled, fumble?
Fumble, hot tomato, wake up!!

[Chorus: Jai Paul]
I wanna get in higher res
I wanna see it on the sick screen
I wanna get it now, anytime, anywhere
I wanna put it on five point one
I just want to get it on
I wanna get it anytime, anywhere
I wanna get in higher res

[Yukimi Nagano]
Turn on, burn out, it's all about
How you wanna give it to me? Yeah
I'm up, online, press send, don't rush
I know you wanna get it in

[Chorus: Jai Paul]
I wanna get in higher res
I wanna see it on the sick screen
I wanna get it now, anytime, anywhere
I wanna put it on five point one
I just want to get it on
I wanna get it now, anytime, anywhere

[Yukimi Nagano]
I wanna get in higher res
I wanna see it on the sick screen
I wanna get it now, anytime, anywhere
I wanna put it on five point one
I just want to get it on...</pre>
