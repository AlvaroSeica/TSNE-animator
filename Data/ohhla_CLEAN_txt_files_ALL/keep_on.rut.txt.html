[Chorus: Beno (Apocalipps)]
If you don't wanna get fucked up (keep on walkin')
If you ain't talk about bread, nigga (keep on walkin')
And if you hot with them fed niggas (keep on walkin')
Keep playing, I'mma put ya punk ass in the coffin
We ain't never slap box, nigga (keep on walkin')
We aint' never go to crack spot (keep on walkin')
If you don't wanna get popped, nigga (keep on walkin')
Keep plaing, I'mma put ya punk ass in the coffin

[Apocalipps]
Attention competition, that nigga Lipps is better than ya'll
I robbed a nigga for his shine, and now I carry his cross
I bought an automatic Super Soaker, wet up your Porsche
I'm bad with authority, I had to bury my boss
A muthafucka better keep on walkin', I don't know what u listenin' to
I make your punk ass eat that Walkman
I remember I was fucked up, down to my last buck
Now shit done changed up, it's crazy, just ask Truck
Approach me on some foreigner shit, that's why I palm the grip
And put six inside a non descript'
Fuck the cats you hang with, and them niggas you sell with
McNabb style, put the eagle to your helmet
I'm trynna get these Jeffersons like Weezy
I hit you once, just for trying to be greazy and sleazy
Now be Eazy, like Eric Wright in his prime
And you can ball til you fall, but just remember this rhyme

[Chorus]

[Truck]
Another day, same shit, for what? I don't know
I been trying the same strip until this rap shit blow
What you doing? Handling biz, scrambling kid
What you need? Truck got it, whatever it is
You feel tough, take ya shit back, blaow, nigga, get back
And starve and smash a nigga for a loosy and a six pack
Guns'll blind and hit a nigga way down under
Send shots to ya car, man, flip ya hunger
I can go commercial, and spit that country grammar
And slide the fuck across the stage like I'm MC Hammer
Go 'head nigga, keep on talkin'
And I'mma put you in the wheelchair, you won't be walking

[Bless]
I pistol whip you in the head, until the blood start oozing
You better play like Soul II Soul, nigga, and keep on moving
I got 20/20 vision, but I'm half retarted
That's why they kept me on the yellow bus with the Bastardz, squeezed up
My style is crazy, it ain't tough talking, break jaws
Cali niggas bang my shit, raising they six fours
I make you clap your moms in the neck, word, and you can bet
That you gon' catch everything like Mike Piazza from the Mets
Now clicks the lights on, everybody got the glass
Cuz when it smash, I don't need no cops on my ass
Cuz I'm already hot like jalapenos and hot sauce
Always bang them glocks off, I cocked up, then popped off

[Chorus]

[Iron Mic]
Fuck what you talking boy, I'm straight New Yorking
Send the money to ya momma house, pay for you coffin
We hit 'em up, split 'em up, watch the nigga get tossed in
Nothing but homicide, we do that often
So move back off me, keep on walkin', the stakes on the block
You dirty, better bounce, and keep on hawking
I ain't rich yet, groupie bitches keep on stalking
The beef? Ain't done until I stick my fork in
Let me get off the topic for a sec, I blast my nine, I'm back
I cut your hands off, you ask about mine and crack
Got these niggas acting like straight fiends
I call my gun La-Z-Boy the way I make 'em lean
You hear the hook, nigga, keep it movin'
And don't expect shit, if you ain't never bust ya gun for Ruthless
If you ain't hold the block with us, you wasn't ready to ride
Will say and die, you don't rock with us
You ain't ready to takeover, hip hop with us
It's Pop Ya Head Off Records, come pop with us

[Chorus]</pre>
