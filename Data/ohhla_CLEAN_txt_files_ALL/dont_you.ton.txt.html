[Verse 1]
Didn't we all see the news that day
And watch as she used that plane to convey her abuse and her pain
Had no use for name, rules had changed
Fixed bets made sure she would lose the game
Trapped under the weather, get used to rain
I'ma "love you forever" I used to say
Never thought she'd react in this ruthless way
Now her hearts turned black and the future's grey
She was hanging from my promise but the noose would frey
I had lovers on her bed where she used to lay
Yes we connected for a moment like June and May
Till our collision made the whole world move astray

[Chorus]
She flew a plane into my heart
Revenge for the lies I'd been telling from the start
She flew a plane into my heart
And things fall apart
Wash away my sins in a shower of glass

[Verse 2]
And in the hours that past
The past warred with the present
I was tortured by thoughts running like storms in the desert
Though my friends tried to calm me I hardly could hear them
or see a reason for this kamikaze
Her heart beat deafened like a march of an army
My fury bloomed like an arching tsunami
Why had she wanted to harm me?
What was the question the mute girl had wanted to ask me
Regardless I answered sharply
With spite and a backhand, love letter ash in a trash can
Humiliated I erased the evidence
No respect for the weak can't fake the sentiment
So I take the relevant resources I need, for free
Her knees bleed as she pleads for me
To let her whisper in my ear "one last chance"
I lift her to her feet for our one last dance
And as we touch there's a blood rush
I blow her a kiss
Pull her forward for the real thing I know it's her wish
But her trust had been corrupted forever
By a man's lust for pleasure
All she could say was

[Chorus: The Tongue, Vocals in parentheses by Bertie Blackman]
(Don't you ever ever)
(Don't you ever ever)
She flew a plane into my heart
(Don't you ever ever)
Revenge for the lies that I'd been telling from the start
(Don't you ever ever)
(Don't you ever ever)
She flew a plane into my heart
And things fall apart
Wash away my sins in a shower of glass

[Hook]
"Time recognise how uncivilized we got" -&gt; Grand Puba
"Damn girl did I offend you"
"I apologise... It's time to come correct" -&gt; Lord Jamar
"Time to recognise how uncivilised we got"
"She be dealing with some issues that you can't believe"
"We cracked our dream with a lack of resepct
It's time to come correct... It's time to come correct"
"It's time to re-re-re-re-recognise how uncivilised we got"
