[Vincent Tolan]
Nigga, don't act like a bitch!
That's why I never love a ho (bitch)
50 Cent, Too $hort, and E-40 sayin' BITCH! (remix!)
She sucked me off, don't kiss that bitch
(from new york to the bay)
(from new york to the bay)
Oh why oh why'd you marry that bitch

[50 Cent]
He said he love 'em man, you really think he love 'em, man?
She's a super freak, freakier than he understands
She not the type of girl that you take home to your mother
She's the type that you take to the track to come up on a sucker
Watch her deep throat; see her DP
Ending up on fours like it's easy
It's not a big deal, she doin' what she do
She doin' it with everybody, not just you (hello)
I'm trying to put you up on game
You getting emotionalÂ—then you can get the fuck on, man
You buy her everything; you let her treat you like a trick
That sugar daddy mentality, it make a nigga sick
She ask for it, you just run and get it for her
No matter how much you give her, she wants more
I hate to tell you, but you end up with a whore
And chances are, if niggas try, they gonna score
Man, fuck that

[Hook]
Bitch!
That's why I never love a ho (bitch!)
50 Cent, Too $hort, and E-40 sayin' BITCH!
She sucked me off, don't kiss that (bitch)
Oh why oh why'd you marry that bitch

[Too $hort]
See me, I get everything I wanna get
I have some fun with it, and make her momma trip
Cause if I'm in her life, it's a problem
A real player's at your girl, you better stop him
Turn your back on the bitch she ain't actin right
He hit it way before you now he's back in her life
What you gon' do when you lose her?
She got a nigga on the side just to use her
If it's me, I'm parkin at the front do'
And you be knockin on her bedroom window
You see the shadows, you hear the sounds
But you don't do nothin you just turn back around like a (BITCH!)
Feelings hurt, ready to cry
You cain't believe, everything she said was a lie
She got a lot of bitch in her but not more than you
I never underestimate what these whores'll do

[Hook]
Nigga don't act like a (bitch!)

[50 Cent]
You love her, I fuck her
She might jump off, she your baby momma
You kiss her, I twist her
And send her ass back to you before you miss her

[Vincent Tolan]
(Bitch!)
I'm a player, baby (I'm a player, baby)
Don't play no games
(bitch!)
I remain the same, I ain't never gon' change
for you bitch
Nah, not for you baby
That's why I'll never love a ho
50 Cent, Too $hort, and E-40 sayin' BITCH! (come on 50 Cent)
She sucked my off, don't kiss that bitch
(please don't kiss her, please don't kiss her)
Oh why oh why'd you marry that bitch

[E-40]
Never slippin and slippin and skippin and drippin and missin (missin)
These cats that I be hangin around don't listen (don't listen)
I be hippin and sippin and smokin and drinkin and spittin (spittin)
and these musty mouth broads they be trippin (they be trippin)
I mean the bitch thought she was bad (bad)
I knew what that batch was thinkin
when she thought what she was thinkin, but she shouldn'ta thought that
I told her the money costs too much and I ain't got a dime
You got to pay me (pay me) or pay me no never mind
I (I) don't sit on the toilet when I go piss (piss)
You (you) got feminine tendencies like a bitch (bitch)
Me (me) I'm solid and concrete I keep it funky (funky)
We (we) we pull up in somethin, actin a donkey (donkey)
She (she) she liftin her dress up showin her monkey (monkey)
See (see) he trippin, he trickin, throwin her money (money)
B (B) I-T-C-H, all in her face (face)
E (E) 40 so laced, stay on the case
