Typed by: Davida.b.

[Intro: Allah Real (girl)]
Yeah, peace, hello? (Hi, baby, how you doin'
Are we still on for tonight?)
Umm... I got something I got to talk to you about
(Ok, baby, what's up?)
I just can't see you

[Allah Real]
It's another lonely night and I'm feelin good (I can't see you)
Not to mention, other things, I been goin' through (I can't see you)
Now I haven't seen you, but yet your presence fills the room
You must be seeing, a dozen men, I do persume

[Chorus: Allah Real]
I can't see you my baby (I can't see you)
See you again (I can't see you)
You are my love, you are my lover (lover)
If you belong to a friend (I can't see you)

[Allah Real]
I'll be glad that our love is so strong, not to separate (I can't see you)
That we were bigger, much to soon, our love came to late (I can't see you)
I'll always love you, love you, there was no storm that we grew, never,
never
I can't believe girl, until this day that were not together

[Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs]

[Allah Real]
It's another lonely night and I'm feelin good (I can't see you)
Not to mention, other things, I been goin' through (I can't see you)
Now I haven't seen you, but yet your presence fills the room
You must be seeing, a dozen men, I do persume

[Chorus to fade w/ ad-libs]</pre>
