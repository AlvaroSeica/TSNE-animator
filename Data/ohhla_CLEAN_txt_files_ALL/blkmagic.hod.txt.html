[Intro]
Yeah... it's not my fault this time
I'ma blame it on {"youuuuu"}
This song I'm making, is especially for {"youuuuu"}
Yeah

[Hodgy Beats]
You make me feel like I'm trash
like I'm failin and stayin in the back of the class
I thought school was whack, bein cool was wack
and niggaz thought I was cool - how cool is that?
I want you to feel my pain, cause I'm out in the rain
but without pain I wasn't gon' gain
My hearts not broken, it's more of a sprain
My life ain't a dance like I'm on Soul Train
My world turned black, inverted cocaine
How can I explain hoppin on the next plane?
6:45 in a 745
Seven shorties live and they ready for the ride
We live to survive, well we livin to die
Smoke 'til we high, BlueJet we gon' fly
Get up like cheddar and get it together
Get it now or never so you can hold it forever

[Chorus]
My Odd Future
I gotta get it right now, I gotta get it right now
My Odd Future
I gotta write these lyrics down, I gotta use this paper right now
My Odd Future
I gotta get it right now, I gotta use this paper right now
My Odd Future
Man I gotta write these lyrics down, spit it, now how this shit sound?
