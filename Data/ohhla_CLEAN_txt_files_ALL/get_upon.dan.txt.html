SEPTO:
Lead in this league I've been leading, leaving the weak behind 
And beneath, see I'm hip-hop as DMC's Adidas
Believe it, I mean it, I'm speaking with meaning, I'm seeming mean in my speech
Seemingly these beats keep me from screaming on these measly MC's
In this tedious, for the street meaningless shit
Each of us speak with people that'll leave enemies leaning and shit
I've been thinking about leaving this bitch
Even before I begin, fuck it, let a nigga be a beacon of light for the like MCs
Niggas like me who don't like MC's, we don't need any more "maybe I might" MC's
15 niggas on stage but 12 don't rap, only need 3 mics MC's
Right MC's, why write and recite, rewind and read 
Each of these 16's and these verses just to be worse than me?
Quit, you're a waste of space, this place is so squished 
With niggas and shades and chains you couldn't fit a razor blade
Changing shit in a major way, fuck what a major label say
AP&amp;A and I made my way, I'mma make 'em say my name
Nominated nigga

CHORUS - DAN-E-O:
None of you niggaz want it, you scared and getting haunted
You thought you hit it, but quit it hearing our shit get flaunted
Get up, get up on it, get get up on it
Get up, get up on it, get get up on it
Leaving your crew astonished, stupid we supersonic
Losers reduced and tarnished producing this ruthless tonic
Get up, get up on it, get get up on it
Get up, get up on it, get get get up on it

DAN-E-O:
Bitches ride my dick like it's racing and has a saddle on
I'm driving in hits like a Cadillac was my catalogue
Your raps all disappoint when they come off like a padded bra
Your battles all end with a catastrophically shattered jaw
They often call Dan a dog, barking on these beats rough
Y'all getting too comfy with music sounding all fleece-stuffed
No wonder y'all sleep 'nuff, rhymes always got morning breath
Stink! Your family's mourning death, Think! Nigga I'm a hornet's nest
Sting! 'Cause I'm disturbed by MC's new but not quite improved
Claiming they don't know me still, like I ain't made the slightest move
Going for the kill, I don't give a fuck niggas, I don't even like these dudes
What? I never been over the hill, I don't even own no hiking boots!
I find it kind of rude, they way you suck's like I paid you sluts
It hurts to hear your tunes, like them lame ass cuts grazed my nuts
A legend in the game, even if a nigga didn't rap anymore
While your stupid ass still trying to get yourself a shot like Plaxico

CHORUS - DAN-E-O:
None of you niggaz want it, you scared and getting haunted
You thought you hit it, but quit it hearing our shit get flaunted
Get up, get up on it, get get up on it
Get up, get up on it, get get up on it
Leaving your crew astonished, stupid we supersonic
Losers reduced and tarnished producing this ruthless tonic
Get up, get up on it, get get up on it
Get up, get up on it, get get...

RICH KIDD:
Hey yo, they lie behind my back but they frontin' on me
They talking trash, but they ain't got nothing on me
Homie, if there's a problem, tell me what it's gon' be
I came from nothing, that's something, I can spot a phony
Money, you know I gotta grind for it, and soon I'll shine for it
But in the meantime nigga, I am putting my custom design on it
You wanna see me fall? Go ahead, hate on nigga
I am about to explode, Apocalypse Now, get your napalm nigga
All my ladies go "ow", all my road dogs go "eh"
Fuck later, we be getting it now, fuck a hater all goddamn day
Ice in my veins, jockey hands, I don't know much about hockey man
But shout out to homie P.K. Subban, 87 heaven like Crosby, damn!
Forget being a rapper, I rather you call me "MC"
Man I be sponsored by NASA, flow from an unknown galaxy
You mad at me, you have to be, show 'em I'm a Hip then Tragically
End your career, Goro-style, finish 'em here fatality!

CHORUS - DAN-E-O:
None of you niggaz want it, you scared and getting haunted
You thought you hit it, but quit it hearing our shit get flaunted
Get up, get up on it, get get up on it
Get up, get up on it, get get up on it
Leaving your crew astonished, stupid we supersonic
Losers reduced and tarnished producing this ruthless tonic
Get up, get up on it, get get up on it
Get up, get up on it, get get get get get...</pre>
