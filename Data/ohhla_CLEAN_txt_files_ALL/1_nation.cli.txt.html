[Intro: Bootsy Collins, Walter Morrison]
So wide, you can't get around it
So low, you can't get under it (So low, you can't get under it)
So high, you can't get over it (So high, you can't get over it)
(Da-yee do do do do do do)
This is a chance, this is a chance, to dance your way (Da-yee do do do do do do)
Out of your constriction, out.. to tell sugah!!

[George Clinton]
Here's a chance to dance our way, out of our constriction
Gonna be freaking Up and down, to hang up alley way
With the groove our only guide, we shall all be moved
Ready or not, here we come
Getting down on the one which we believe in

[Chorus: Bootsy Collins, Walter Morrison]
One nation under a groove (Can I get it on my good foot Good God?)
Getting down just for the funk of it (About time I got down one time)
One nation we're on the move (UHH!)
Nothing can stop us now (Aye aye aye aye aye)

[George Clinton]
Feet don't fail me now
Give you more of what you're funking for
Feet don't fail me now
Do you promise to funk; the whole funk, nothing but the funk?
Ready or not, here we come
Getting down on the one which we believe in
Here's my chance to dance my way, out of my constriction

[Interlude: Bootsy Collins, Walter Morrison]
Do do dee oh doo, do do dee oh doo
Do do dee oh doo, do do dee oh doo
Do do dee oh doo, do do dee oh doo
Do do dee oh doo, do do dee oh doo
Yeaaaahhhh, you can dance away

[George Clinton]
(Feet don't fail me now.. ha ha)
Here's a chance to dance our way, out of our constriction
Gonna be grooving up and down, hang up alley way
The groove our only guide, we shall all be moved
(Feet don't fail me now.. ha ha)
Giving you more of what you're funking for
Feet don't fail me now
Here's my chance to dance my way, out of my constriction
(Feet don't fail me now)
Giving you more of what you're funking for
(Feet don't fail me now)
Do you promise to funk; the whole funk, nothing but the funk?

[Chorus: Bootsy Collins, Walter Morrison X3]
One nation under a groove, getting down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move, nothing can stop us now
Nothing can stop us now!!

[George Clinton]
Do you promise to funk? do you promise to funk?
Hah, do you promise to funk?
Hah, do you promise to funk; the whole funk?
One nation under a groove, getting down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move, nothing can stop us now

[Chorus: Bootsy Collins, Walter Morrison until faded]

[Outro: George Clinton overlapping the above chorus]
Nothing can stop us now!
Here's my chance to dance my way, out of my constriction
Uhhha ha ha.. do you promise to funk; the whole funk, nothing but the funk?
You can't stop us now!
One nation under a groove, getting down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move, nothing can stop us now
Feet don't fail me now.. ha ha ha ha
Feet don't fail me now..
One nation under a groove, getting down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move, nothing can stop us now
You can't stop us now!
Giving you more of what you're funking for 
(Giving you more of what you're funking for)
Feet don't fail me now.. can I.. can I get it on my good foot Good God?
Uhhha ha ha.. can I get it on my good foot.. ONE TIME!!
Giving you more of what you're funking for
Feet don't fail me now..</pre>
