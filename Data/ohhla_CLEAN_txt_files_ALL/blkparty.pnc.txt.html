She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love
She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love
She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love, Oh Love
She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love
When I was young my Mother watched me as I played
And every night she got down on her knees and to the Lord she prayed
For her son who will one day be up in this World
And that he grows old enough, strong enough to watch her baby Girl
Back in those days, we all done some bad
But my Mother grabbed me by my shirt and smacked me on my back
That's one thing I can say and even the man up above
Even though my Mother spanked me she has always shown me love
She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love
She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love
She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love, Oh Love
She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love</pre>
