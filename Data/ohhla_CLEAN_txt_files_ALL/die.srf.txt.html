Oh, Surf!
Or die!
Surf!
Or die!
Surf!
Or die!
You've got to surf!
Or diiieee!
We were born in the year of our lord
With nothing on our backs but our funky surf boards
Miles at sea - that's where you'll find us
Hundred foot waves, not far behind us
Sharks on my right, sharks on my left
One false move, we knew it was death
Thats when we heard a terrifying cry
"Hug wood, homeboy - you better surf or die!"
Surf!
Or die!
Surf!
Or die!
Radical!
You've got to surf!
Or die!
Homeboy!
Surf or die!
Surf or die!
We surfed as Magellan; we surfed as Columbus
We surf around the world, and we don't need a compass
We have no beginning
We have no end
If you're reincarnated, you'll surf with us again!
Surf!
Forget the other shit
The other shit's bunk!
We want the beach town surf
We walk on the beach, in the sand
with our boards in our hand
And If you don't know by now
Then you'll never understand!
Surf!
Surf!
R-r-radical!
Surf!
Radical!
Surf or die!
Or die!
Or die!
Now on the beach, Californ-I-A
Where another surfers born every single day
Zuma Jay board, the one I use to surf
We put on our wheels when we're rollin' on the dirt
We roll through the streets, we roll through the valleys
We roll through the hills, and we roll through the alleys
Once on water, now on land
If it can be ridden than the funky surfers can!
Surf!
Surf!
Or die!
Radical!
Surf!
Homeboy!
Or die!
You've got to surf!
Or die!
Or die!
Surf!
Or die!
Radical!
Surf!
Or die!
Radical!
Surf!
Or die!
Radical!
You've got to surf!
Or die!
Or die!
Surf!
Or die!
Surf or die!
Radical!</pre>
