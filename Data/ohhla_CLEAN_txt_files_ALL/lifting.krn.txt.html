As we go deeper...
 
[Hook]
Now we're lifting up the veil
Truth will never ever fail
 
[K-Rino]
Lift the veil, so we can uncover what the fasad is
The best question a person can ask, is who God is
Right up the to the minute that I'm speaking, there are doubts
Of God's existence, his identity and his whereabouts
And life's purpose, and how this universe functions
For eons, God hid himself from amongst men
So confusion set in, and after many years
Man developed his own philosophies and ideas
Of who the creator is, and how we all came
Without scriptural evidence, to verify claims
Devils and wicked, the arise aims
Who realized the truth, and then intentionally exercised change
And over time the holiness, was stripped down and took
God's word, was not always in the form of a book
The laws and the wisdom, was always told
To the prophets originally, and placed on a scroll
Which those who wanted to read, came and looked on
But eventually was compiled, into a book form
The variations, came through translations the Greeks knew
The original tone and scriptures came from, was Hebrew
The foundation of Christianity, was drawn up from it
The Greek translation, was known as the supplicate
A word meaning seventy, and that number was taken
Because 72 scouters, did the work of translating
The different interpretations, are served as a deterrent
There were multiple versions, that pre-dated the current
The Bishop bible, the Geneva bible of Matthews
The Tyndale and the Wycliffe, in 1382
The Vulgate, and Martin Luther even had a version
By him the old testament, was worded into German
In the 1500's, but he let it be known
There was a Latin version in 400 B.C., by St. Jerome
It was many more, who got hold of the word and mishandled it
And they got it from the Hebrew, original manuscript
Confusion, whether you use a old one or a new one
The question is, with so many to choose which is the true one
A few years ago, I eluded
To the fact in the Catholic bible, seven extra books are included
Let me list 'em, for those who might dispute it
First and second Maccabees, the Clesiastikus, the Tolbert and Judith
The Baruk, and the wisdom of Solomon were dismissed
That's how it went from 73, to 66
And contradictions started landing
When man began to change God'd words, and lean towards his own understanding
Now modern day idol warship, rules the mainstream
Christianity and Christ teachings, are not the same thing
When the ruler Constantine, became a Christian
He made men combine religious principles, with the ways of the Pagans
Holidays like Easter, were based on the phrase
That Jesus died and rose from the grave, in three days
But if he died on a Friday, it's untrue
And rose on a Sunday, then that would make it only two
They celebrate his birth in December, called it immaculate
But if you read the scriptures, then that timeline's inaccurate
See Sheppards don't have their flocks, out in the winter
Which proves that the Christ, was not born in December
See if Jesus was 33 and a half, when he was killed
And his murder took place, after the passover meal 
Passover was in March or April, this is a fact
If he was 33 and one half year, let's count back
See a half a year's six months, subtract from where I told ya
Six months from March or April, is September or October
It's over, for truth many died and others bled
What did Jesus have to do, with rabbits and colored eggs
See the Pagans had a ritual, when Spring time came around
And women painted their bodies, and hid till they were found 
And homosexual men hid too
And whoever found them can do, any sex act they chose to 
With Jesus's name, lies were bred
That tradition was passed down, and that's the reason why you hide eggs
And if this is the true day, then something's unclear
Why does Easter fall, on a different day every year
What is Thanksgiving about, who were the Pilgrims
The wicked criminals, who tricked the Indians and killed 'em
You love Chris Columbus, but he was no friendlier
He left Europe and got lost, he thought he was in India
63 years later, Africa's infiltrators
The motherland invaders, American slave traders
The devious thieves, who came to Africa to sieze us 
Transported the blacks, on a ship named Jesus
Across the Atlantic, made stops in the Caribbean
Depicted Jesus's image, as a blond European
Conniving, conditioned our minds and put the lies in
When revelations 1 and 14, clearly describes him
This won't close, till all of the lies have been exposed
The CIA and FBI, knows of UFO's
See some claim conspiracy, and mock presented truths
Go research the evidence, and documented proof
You can find 'em in the bible, the prophets know what they are
In the book of Ezekiel, the will that he saw
The government knows they're real, but it rarely surfaces
But more importantly, they know what their real purpose is
Economy falling, people tricked by the government
Calamities and plays, are all part of God's judgment
And in the end, real truth is never cur-tailed
When the facts get covered up, we're lifting up the veil
 
(*talking*) 
Ha-ha-ha, come on lifting up the veil 
(lifting up the veil), the veil of ignorance (yes sir)
Study (study), learn the truth
Don't just take what people say on face value
Do your research, yeah
I know you been taught like this, all your life
I know what mama said, I know they didn't give you this in school
Elementary, middle school, high school, college
Even the church, so that mean it's up to you
Get your knowledge up
Don't be afraid to challenge the preacher and the teacher
Ask questions, read, learn history true history
Oh yeah, and there's a man names Elijah Muhammad
Check him out, ha-ha you might learn something</pre>
