Song:   If You Got Funk You Got Style  
Typed by: dy_face@hotmail.com

[Intro/Chorus: Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins]
If you got funk, you got style
You're funking and you're styling all the while
When you got funk, you got class
You're out on the floor moving your ass

[Verse One: Bernie Worrell, George Clinton]
She ain't conscientious about her talk
Don't give a damn about her walk
She gets to that and that's the funk?
When she does this funk she never stop
You don't claim to be a super freak
She just want to dance to a freaky beat
She don't claim to be a cover girl
Don't claim to be going a whirl

Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead (cover girl)
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead (super freak)
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead (she ain't)
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead

[Chorus: Bernie Worrell, George Clinton X2]
If you got funk, you got style
You're funking and you're styling all the while
When you got funk, you got class
You're out on the floor moving your ass

[Verse Two: Bootsy Collins]
Girl'll give it a whirl, she ain't a super freak
Girl ain't a cover girl, girl I need a super beat
Girl'll give it a whirl, girl ain't a cover girl
Girl'll give it a whirl, girl ain't a cover girl
Girl'll give it a whirl, girl ain't a cover girl
Girl'll give it a whirl, girl ain't a cover girl
Girl'll give it a whirl, girl ain't a cover girl
Ain't a cover girl, she ain't a super freak
Girl'll give it a whirl, girl ain't a cover girl
Girl ain't a cover girl (need a freaky beat)
She'll give it a whirl (ow!)
Girl ain't a cover girl
She'll give it a whirl (she needs a super beat)
Girl ain't a cover girl (she needs a super...beat)
She'll give it a whirl, Girl ain't a cover girl
She'll give it a whirl, Girl ain't a cover girl
She'll give it a whirl, Girl ain't a cover girl (ow!)
She'll give it a whirl, Girl ain't a cover girl</pre>
