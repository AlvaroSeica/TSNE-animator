[Chorus]
I seen a whole lot of girls in my days, my days
None of them have ever made me say
what I'm about to say to you
You bad than a motherfucker, motherfucker
You bad than a motherfucker
What's it gonna take for me to get you?

[Daz]
She was bad than a motherfucker, sexy with a triple-X
Type of girl that need somethin' nasty to keep the pillow wet
And I feel her strippin' naked in the silhouette
Come a little closer baby girl 'cause I'm feelin' it
She the hottest, super bad and exotic
(She got a gang of ass and god damn she got it)
Never seen her before, but I seen her when she walked in the door
God damn, I got to have it for sure
(The DJ playin' my song and it won't be long
I put the mackin' in effect, try to get in her thong)
You gain some you lose some, me I'm one to choose from
I got game (baby girl, and I want some)
She the shit, and she know it
Pop a couple of bottles, let Diggy Daz overflow it
My emotions I'm showin', take time with the cutie
Tax it and watch me do my thang with the booty

[Chorus]
I seen a whole lot of girls in my days, my days
None of them have ever made me say
what I'm about to say to you
You bad than a motherfucker, motherfucker
You bad than a motherfucker
What's it gonna take for me to get you?

There's some hoes in this house
When you seem 'em point 'em out
Get 'em on the dance floor, turn 'em out
Cause there's some hoes in this house

[Daz]
This is for them super bad bitches lookin' good in the club
Wanna smoke with a player, wanna drink on some bubb'
She lookin' like a lawyer, lookin' like a actress
Super bad model 'cause she's lookin' so attractive
(We got weed in the air, middle fingers up
Bitch on my side, drink in my cup
Niggaz startin' to sound like bitches, they need to quit
I'm on the corner posted with a bad ass bitch)
She lookin' good in them jeans, hat to match
She all up on the ballsack, how ill is that?
She a bad mamma jamma from New York to Savannah
From Miami to L.A., to the Bay to Atlanta

[Chorus - 2X]
I seen a whole lot of girls in my days, my days
None of them have ever made me say
what I'm about to say to you
You bad than a motherfucker, motherfucker
You bad than a motherfucker
What's it gonna take for me to get you?</pre>
