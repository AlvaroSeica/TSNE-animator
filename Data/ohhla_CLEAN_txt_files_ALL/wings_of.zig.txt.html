Song:   Wings of an Eagle
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If I have the wings of an eagle
If I have the wings of an eagle
I would fly, fly away
Flyyyyyyy awayyyyyyy and beeeeee at rest

If I have the wings of an eagle
If I have the wings of an eagle
I would fly, fly away
Flyyyyyyy awayyyyyyy and beeeeee at rest

Oh,
Since I have no wings [x3]
I'm gonna sing, sing, sing, eh

Since I have no wings [x3]
I'm gonna sing, sing, sing, sing

If I have the wings of an eagle
If I have the wings of an eagle, oh oh oh
I would fly, fly away
Flyyyyyyy awayyyyyyy and beeeeeee at rest

If I have the wings of an eagle
If I have the wings of an eagle
I would fly, fly away
Flyyyyyyy awayyyyyyy and beeeeeee at rest

Oh,
Since I have no wings [x3]
I'm gonna sing, sing, sing, eh

Since I have no wings [x3]
I'm gonna sing, sing, sing, sing

If I have the wings of an eagle
If I have the wings of an eagle
I would fly, fly away,
Flyyyyyyy awayyyyyyy and beeeeee at rest</pre>
