[ VERSE 1: Breeze ]
Look at me, see what I mean
The rap race is like a chase because it seems
The envious involve themselves in every envision
They didn't listen so I'm dissin with precision
No one can mess with me, that decision is def with me
They praise and raise and kiss the one they look up to, me
I'm a myth to you, a gift to you, cuddy
The decision is choice, your voice is ( ? )
He who listen and observes the words I let off
Will know my J is not the A, get off
The tip quick, cause you're really makin me sick
Why don't you go and pick another rapper style to vic-
timize, I'm wise in size, call me sort of slender
A friend or foe or fiend, never been a ( ? )
To you or your crew or whoever the hell you run with
Larger than life, my picture should be on the hundred

[ VERSE 2: Breeze ]
Adventurous, admit you just seen the best
I'm not a sleeper, I don't fiend for rest
I guess I'm blessed with just the style I possess
Every rookie gets ransacked, so who's next?
I look in the mirror, the picture is clearer, I'm number one
Loads of lyrics, list them all I sprain my tongue
Don't need a chiropractor to help me rap to
This beat, now I got you captured
I come in peace; just because I'm young
Doesn't mean ( ? ) fun, knowledge and wisdom's what I brung
Ain't a arm I can't break off, sucker I can't shake off
My frame is like a plane, prepare for smooth take-off
I need to succeed and believe I'm gunning
No outside interference, my appearance is stunning
Ain't no more ontakers, doggone it
You know what they say: if you got it, flaunt it

[ VERSE 3: Breeze ]
The wack is surely to rap but lack the skill
To be a big spender or crack a mill
They need to stop or drop or flop or just lay off
May I say, Jos√©, stay off
It's up to me to keep the crowd pumpin
Make the crowd come alive because I'm sayin somethin
Worth listenin to, and if it was you
You'd probably do the same thing as I do
Bettin it all that it's a hit tune
And by the time I hit your streets I'm gonna need more tip room
The groove is smooth but it won't be the last one
Like flow I changed it around and pulled a fast one</pre>
