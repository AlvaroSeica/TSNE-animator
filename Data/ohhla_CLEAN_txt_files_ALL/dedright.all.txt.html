Get response from BK, in the Bronx you see J
In Queens and Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Flashin, I kid around, shorties I bend them down
Horizontally, like the ??? leaf?
Pass it on ta me I still take two tokes
With tha franchise for making a few notes
Guns my crew totes, stay licensed 
Mega Large, the K, G.V the Ison
So dope you take a liking
And never leave, it's better to receive
From a shorty, how she blessed me, and her friends bless me
And they friends bless me
And so on and so on, so Mega get his Ho on
The Benz wit the gold on, me I got my dough on
Plus glow on, what I flow on, you fold on
You too slow on, gets no one
I fears no one, and throw on, you need ta grow one
And I'ma go on and hit the jackpot
Hate phony ass rappers wit weak styles that act hot
And I'm a crack shot, who shootin up tha chart?
Number one with the bullet, All City good shit
Now watch a hood get hype for me
I guess the time ta shine is just right fo' me
I guess she might call me, now that I'm stackin'
Ya know what the problem is with most of you cats, y'all need backin'

[Hook]
Well if it's hot then you dead right, we there every night
Livin tha high life, under the red lights
In the club sippin' iced Don, getting my Nice on
Scope the scene for something nice then I'm gone (2X)

[Gregg Valentine]
I make maneuvers wit Kahlua's and Bailey's, JoJo and Casey hear me
It's Valentine yours sincerely
Your rarely see major players with a pair and gleam
Wit out ice on, they so nice-on
It's extremely hot on the block that I be on
Some cool as a fan shit, without the Freon 
And way beyond, what the average cat be on
So you couldn't put a price on this, I'm priceless
They call me Mac-A-Ho, quik ta spit at a ho
Spectacular glow, I drop lovely and pop bubbly
Not one of the, niggas I run wit is lame
It's ill, I personally feel we mastered tha game
Now the word in tha hood is the City is hot
New wave, El Demarco it's a pity you not
Either get me or get got, is the rules in tha street
And that's the same for this rap game I jack you for your beats
I stay relaxed troop, skunk in the Coupe, gun in my boot
Beirut style
Offi-cal, slow down before I twist out
Wit the pist-al, piss crystal
City style, something exquisite, six digits

[Hook] - 2X

[J-Mega]
What I formulate, all my niggas on the corner play
They call on J, the next ta hold a flow, what more ta say?
That's all it take, with no questions
High rollers and nothing less then
My Baisley shorty's tha Best Western
For the blessin', you see I react ta stacks, salute
The Bastard who, been right since "The Actual"
It's not a game yo; it's something that I have ta do
Ya come up lame thou, that's when I'm gunning after you

[G.V]
I'm dressed appropriate, a night on the town, wit my associates
We rolling thick, lookin' for shorties whose holdin dick
In the strip bar, ???, it's bizarre 
Chicks galore, anaconda draggin' on the floor
High endurance, top notch shit for your insurance
Stellar performance, that's how tha City got enormous
I esures all when on floor, wit the ?chorus?
Valentine Esquire, God know it's hot

[Hook]
