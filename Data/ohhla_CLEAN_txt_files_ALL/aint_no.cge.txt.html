[Verse One]
I was walkin down the street when out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approachin me
She said I never seen a man, who looks so all alone
and could you use a little company?
If you can pay the right price, your evening will be nice
But you can go and send me on my way
I said your such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself? 
She looked at me and this is what she said 

[Chorus]
Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothin in this world for free
Oh no I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish, I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good

[Verse Two]
Not even 15 minutes later after walkin down the street
when I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't lookin for a fight
He said give me all you've got, I want your money not your life
If you try to make a move I won't think twice
I told him you can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask
What made you want to live this kind of life? 

[Chorus]
He said there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothin in this world for free
Oh no I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know, I wish, I could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good

[Verse Three]
Well now a couple hours past, and I was sitting in my house
The day was winding down and coming to an end
And so I turned on the TV, and flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same 
Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills  

[Chorus]
You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed
There ain't nothin in this world for free
Oh no we can't slow down, we can't hold back
Though you know, we wish, we could
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good</pre>
