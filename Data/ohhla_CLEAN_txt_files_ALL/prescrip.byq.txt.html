Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Prescription drugs, show me love
Percocets, Adderall
Xanny bars, get codeine involved
Stuck in this body high, can't shake it off
I'm falling off, I can't hold a thought
What's wrong with me? Now the pressure creep
I'm stressing deep, even in my sleep
My mommy call, I hit ignore
My daughter calls, I press ignore
My chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor
I'm blanking out, woke up on the couch
Dinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts
I had a bust out in the 80's but yo, the karma's worse
I cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when [?]
My senses harmed, sluggish ruggish
A couple Xannies popped, open my pill box
Prescription drugs

[Interlude: Joy]
What's wrong, daddy?! Wake up! Wake up!

[Verse 2]
Prescription drugs, I fell in love
My little secret, she gon' kill a thug
My body numb, she like to give me hugs
I love her touch, I get a rush
When she don't come around, I start to go nuts
My heart erupts, I'm curled in pain
My phone ring, ring and ring and ring
If you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing
May 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6:45, I finally answer this time
He said "Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes"
I don't decline, at least that's in my mind
Grab the keys, need some wood for the trees
Dap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC
Continue right, remember seeing light
Wise night, but that's my life
Prescription drugs

[Joy]
What's wrong you tired? You mad? OK I love you daddy</pre>
