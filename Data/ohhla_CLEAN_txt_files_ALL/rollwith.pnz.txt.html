Typed by: no1wammy@hotmail.com

[Ark]       You can get with this
            Or you could get with that
            Gotta roll with me, baby
            You gotta roll with me
[Fingazz]   "Roll, with, me"
            "Roll, with, me"
[T-Weaponz] Roll with me
            Roll with me
            Roll with me
[Ark]       Yeah
            Ch-ching

[Verse 1: Ark]
Damn right
I'm a lady killer
Don't chase you, ma
I'm a lazy nigga, I don't need no Mercedes
Nigga
Just a little dab, but the gift of the gab
Help me splits from the pit, from the bag
My bad, I don't usually stare
Let me hop out my seat like musical chairs
Ma, don't we make a beautiful pair
Why look any further, your future is here
Yeah
And the feeling's mutual here
So come up out the chrome, get out the cubicle chair
Sounds good, what's your name and sign
If you come and hurry up, before I change my mind

Chorus: T-Weaponz
Stop
And roll with me
Stop
And roll with me
Stop
And roll with me
Roll with me, roll with me

Repeat Chorus

[Fingazz] "Roll, with, me"
          "Roll, with, me"
[Psalmz]  Think it's about time that you
[Fingazz] "Roll, with, me"
          "Roll, with, me"

[Verse 2: Psalmz]
I make grands in my sleep, keep hands on my piece
And I never bring sand to the beach
Miss No-Name, when I thought I sew cane
And she sort of rope chain
Hangin' out in close range
Soon as hunk went, then there's one we could buy
Cause the shine on my link make hons squint the eyes
She ain't concerned when she turn up the bass
She be rollin' so hard, make a nigga turn his face (Damn!)
Honey got the whip appeal, love the way she look in heels
Long, as she look good in thongs, that could cook a meal
So
Listen here, I don't mean to interfere
You could stay and play with him, with me, you can disappear

Repeat Chorus Twice

[IzReal]  Think it's about time you roll with me
[Fingazz] "Roll, with, me"
          "Roll, with, me"
          {*IzReal imitates monkey sounds*}
          "Roll, with, me"
          "Roll, with, me"

[Verse 3: IzReal]
She already tryin' to match wits
And that's cool
Cause I hate it when they ass kiss
I like a challenge
Slow down, from that phat shit
End up in the wrong lane
Gonna crash quick, mami, don't be backwards
I'm just straight forward, this ain't the place for us
Tell your friends, "We rollin' out," to wait for us
But I don't think they mind at all
Cause my niggas handpicked, they as fine as y'all
So let's go, we could leave alone
Call the shots, ma, you don't even need your phone
And we could bring the whole team, the track meet is on
Get your back, mami, we is gone, let's go

Repeat Chorus Twice

Hook: Ark {T-Weaponz &amp; Fingazz}
Put your arms like this and {roll with me}
Now, to do it like this, just {roll with me}
Move your arms like this and {roll with me}
Now, do it backwards, come {roll with me}

Repeat Hook

[Ark]     Come on
          Oh!
[Fingazz] "Roll, with, me"
          "Roll, with, me"
[Ark]     Come on
[Fingazz] "Roll, with, me"
          "Roll, with, me"
[Ark]     Everybody, come on</pre>
