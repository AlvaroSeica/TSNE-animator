Put you to bed, bed, bed
Put you to bed, bed, bed

Girl, change into that Victoria Secret thing that I like
Alright

Now put me right next to you
Finna raise temp in the room
First rub my back like you do
Right there (uh huh) right there (uh)
You touch me like you care
Now stop
And let me repay you for the week that you've been through
Workin' that nine to five and stayin' cute like you do
Oh, oh, oh

Wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you til your eyes roll back
