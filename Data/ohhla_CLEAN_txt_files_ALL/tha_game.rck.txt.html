[Raekwon]
Wall to wall.. that's my word
I want approximately.. everything you got
The verdict.. that's right

Yo... 
Call me the black champion Guess down, wanna test now
So let's grab the mack and vest, bless him if he stressed out
Amazin glazin Purple Haze patients
Blazin asians in Mercedes Benz stations
Yo moving through the tavern, guns that burn, sons that learn
Stabbin an intern, corporate book of words
Iceatollah Motorolas, gun reloaders, broads with rollers
When wet lense stolers, Lex glowers who owe us
Call up Comissionary Gordon, son go warn the Warden
that the lord is back, rollin with his sword again
Mix tape, masturbation mate rate plates ice traits
Guns wit bitches jumpin outta white cakes
It's on for real, indeed, Lex Leonardo
Shells that's hollow, six whipper through the 52 globe of horror
Carry the stainless steel armor
Nurture the church avenue drama, yo, African gold from Ghana
Puffin these marijuanas make Allah catch Alzheimers
Feedin bread to birds yellin fuck old timers

Chorus: Raekwon

It's called game, game get ya life kilt, game recognize
Write wills, game slight chills things stay the same
Game, subliminary mill's smash grills night chills
Regardless what Pah things won't be the same
Game'll get ya life kilt game rcognize
Write wills, game slighht chills things stay the same
Game, subliminary mill's smash grills night chills
Mic skills baby pah won't be the same
Game

(check this out, one two, yeah yeah this is me P no doubt)

[Prodigy]
Segregate those fake punks
Separate the bullshit from the authentic
Vintage rhyme division got the globe listening
My rap scroll belittled your goals and visions
Prohibition got my whole block pissin Christians
One-fifty-one Dunn'll have you off balance walkin
Don't let your e-motions get involved talkin
to the wrong culprit, the killer be the soft spoken
So what's ya intentions, you want to glow for the moment?
Throw on ya two pennys then you boltin
I rock for the few chosen, who got they third minds open
Write a page that'll engage war and encite fights
Be on the look for the bright lights and North Winds
The trumpets be the mics ya size malevolent
You don't be long in my evesight, Pee's a powerful soldier
of the light and things won't be the same
The game's over

Chorus

[Ghostface]
MC Ultra high-brolic bank roll alcahol vulture
Garlic balls dice the shield of ocre
Tally ho pitty-pat backgammon pro
Pink salmon five spring rolls know me, you love my intro
Half a face wig sewed together like Manhattan Chase
Lookin like statue of praise, check behind the drapes
Castor Troy layin for Travolta mic gun pump
Layin on the floor Clark's bleedin watermelon chunks
Hold up... sprinkle the hash, Tony Chapstick
Snatch RZA last piece of fish right off the glass dish
Butter roll beats bagel tracks wavey hair decks
Lay it down straw hat style, Butterball crown
Time life investments, when broke I wrote the old testament
Crashed domes now perform excellence
Words with the President, brunch with Yeltsin
Gorbachev under Meth's nuts, he out in Belgium
Six and a half monkeys, twelve nazis
Four disappear, three eight two one flash to thin air
God's replica no wheel drive motionless mind cresica
Tilt the hat like Esther

Chorus

[Pete Rock]
Aiyyo, I rumble into action, son I'm right on target
Legendary status with the way the track started
It's on, at any second with the high stakes
Drama, the game's teeth sharp like pirahana
There's a million style biters who try to create
Make no mistake real niggaz challenge the fake
Most valuable SP-1200 gold medals
Rae Progidy Ghost rhyme professional
The original, Pete Rock is like Soul on Ice
Dynamite with the mic device
Now roll the dic, for the game of death
Snake eyes baby pah, the Boy Wonder's a threat</pre>
