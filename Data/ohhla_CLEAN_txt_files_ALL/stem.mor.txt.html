Yo, I'm ready for my close up for little lionize girl post ups
but coast erupts small fatty nodules in mind slot ducks
As iceblinks brighten the expanses in the sky
paper clips splice vendettas from hopefuls in Christ of anti-trust
Which supposedly soothes the barren tooth that bites down on the cobs of false philos root
Connoting slight contempt when malice is deemed an upper hand
Plucked from the sky to be bellow manners door mat
I reside in the apterium between feather tracts on the body of a bird
Undergird elevations
helping at least one wingless leave the station
But tell me to come to terms with my own lacks and... hesitation
My life's meaning is null and void in the static pixel screening spheroid
Imbibe scorn to drown the paper with ink
Teetering on the brink with insipid parallels missing link
Compounded down to the carnal framed cookie clone barcode
My corrode abode is this bodies rest
But me mental's kotic spawn
Unwillingly
 the stretched out rope good and evil tug-a-war on
Being of humble decent, worldly's pounce a louse too naive and con
Someone has to be the napkin they wipe their crap on
Dwelling on the five pointed symbol I wanted me to be
The "All eyes on me" square disappears like the picture in the figure in Marty's hand
Take advantage of opportunities
don't let doubt be a bind
'cause being a candle
wax is your talent and the lit fire is your time
The bulky clusters of rain drops suffice the eleventh sign of the zodiac
But behind clack doors diminish desires a little
I fiddle with ideas and aspirations of being a star
while under pressure I crack like ground coriander in jar
Citizen Kane on my death bed and Yeshua's my "rosebud"
Reliving the monotonous act of a mouth full of cud
staring long out to the sky and back
Out past the small 'S' constellation near the celestial pole containing coalsack
Clicks of human opluent one's talk about me and mine's
 uncool
I look down upon their piles of riches from inside god's palm
Theology keeningly manifested
Animism congested soul via psalm
Still my lacks double park in the lot of my brain
And I'ma pure white carpet with a permanent stain
A coxswain with no rowing rhythm in boat to length gain
So I sit with a puss on and a wrinkled shirt
to be the un-slept on pillow in the bed of malapert content
I'm the un-slept on pillow in the bed of malapert content
I'm the un-slept on pillow in the bed of malapert content
I'm the un-slept on pillow in the bed of malapert content.
(bridge)
Still my lacks double park in the lot of my brain
And I'ma pure white carpet with a permanent stain x5
Still my lacks double park in the lot of my brain
This is how I do
I try to maintain
That's why I praise God everyday
'cause if I don't I become inadequate by the minute
That's what the song's about
I'm just a stem in the tree try'na stick out x4
