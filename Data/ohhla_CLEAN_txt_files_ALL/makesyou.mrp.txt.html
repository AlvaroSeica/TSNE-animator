(Intro, Master P)
I guess they say music don't have no substance these days
I'ma just add a lil' flavor, some season to it
No Limit Forever, Master P, Famous Again
Ghetto motivation
I do this for the hood

(Hook, Master P)
Whatever don't kill you, my nigga
It make you stronger
Say life's a bitch, my nigga
When these haters on ya
I said whatever don't kill you, my nigga
It make you stronger
Say that life's a bitch, my nigga
When these haters on ya
(Rome)
Ain't nobody perfect
But somebodies worth it
How ya gonna judge me nig
And you don't know me nig
How ya gonna judge me nig
And you don't know me nig

(Verse 1, Master P)
Shit, I lost a couple dollars
These haters thought I was done
I had a hundred and thirty
You niggas never had none!
I outsmarted you fakers
I know you bitches be hatin
You dressin like you's in Mangas
I know you fuckin with Satan
You niggas mad cause I'm on
You boys trippin we back
You haters talkin that bullshit
Ain't never been where we at
I got millions invested
Applied knowledge for billions
You mammals regular lizards
I turn colors chameleon
You cowards forming your circles
Don't want no piece with you haters
I ain't gon' ask for no spends
I got too many acres
These industry niggas phony
See, I can see through you homie
Already got five Grammy's
I'm tryin'a get me a Tony
I mean a Oscar, you hater
I blood and sweat for this paper
Your system build a nigga up, and then you rob us and rape us
No education, you take us
And then you use us and shake us
And we don't run fast enough, you lock us up and replace us

(Hook)
Whatever don't kill you, my nigga
It make you stronger
Say life's a bitch, my nigga
When these haters on ya
I said whatever don't kill you, my nigga
It make you stronger
Say that life's a bitch, my nigga
When these haters on ya
(Rome)
Ain't nobody perfect
But somebodies worth it
How ya gonna judge me nig
And you don't know me nig
How ya gonna judge me nig
And you don't know me nig

(Verse 2, Dee-1)
...and I'm back again
Audio dope- I'm traffickin'
Got a foot up in the door
Now I'm comin' for the dough
Runnin' fast like an African! (Woo!)
They don't know my story! (They don't know my story!)
They ain't live this chapter! (They ain't live this chapter!)
They didn't sweat this pain! (They didn't sweat this pain!)
Boy, I ain't no rapper!
But I got flows for days (I should write a book)
Got shows for days (My schedule book)
Got fours for days (They don't like me)
Got bros for days (They'll die for me!)
Not probably! They'll ride for me!
All day for me!
They pray for me!
That's faithfully!
Tell that hater jump-jump, get away from me!
Tell that snake sss-sss, hiss away from me!
All work, man this ain't no play for me!
Here to move this thing from A to Z!
But God told me just be patient, Dee!
Got money and I'm young, so Wayne can see!
Rockin a nation, so Jay can see!
Playin no-good music, yay can see!
Whole unit full of G's like J-A-C
K-S-O-N, that's Curtis dawg!
I ain't nervous, dawg!
Why you nervous, dawg!?
I got a purpose, dawg!
Life ain't perfect, dawg!
But I got good news, it's worth it dawg! (Yes!)
That's why I don't run from y'all! (Nah!)
My blessin' don't come from y'all! (Nah!)
Everybody in life who counted me out, Dee-1 finna com for y'all!

(Hook)
Whatever don't kill you, my nigga
It make you stronger
Say life's a bitch, my nigga
When these haters on ya
I said whatever don't kill you, my nigga
It make you stronger
Say that life's a bitch, my nigga
When these haters on ya
(Rome)
Ain't nobody perfect
But somebodies worth it
How ya gonna judge me nig
And you don't know me nig
How ya gonna judge me nig
And you don't know me nig

(Verse 3 Intro, Overlapping Hook/Silkk Tha Shocker)
Yeah, P
I just don't wanna discuss this no more...
It's not up for debate
Talkin icons...
Shocker!
See if y'all can keep up! Ha...
Let's go

(Verse 3, Silkk Tha Shocker)
Not perfect, but I'm worth it
I trick on myself, I deserve it
When I surface, they get nervous
They know that bullshit they sayin really ain't workin
They amusing, just like it was a circus
But me, I'm just serving my purpose
And sometimes, I just don't wan' see 'em
Good thing the Maybach come with some curtains
I don't wan' see 'em, I don't wan' be 'em
I'm too busy tryin to chase these hams
While they green fall off like leaves, I'm just raking it all in
They wouldn't get a hit if I pitched it underhand
If you real, then you would understand
I treat this mil' like it's a hundred grand
It's crazy when you got haters becoming a fan
But I don't hear y'all, I don't feel y'all
Lookin for me? I'm right here, dawg
But when you this good, and you this rich
You could afford to take a few of those years off
But I'm back like a paid vay-cay
Please stay out of my face
And this ain't no social media, but please stay out of my space
So stop judgin, cause I ain't budgin
In a day I spent a year of your budget
It could be that, or the simple fact
That I spent it all like it wasn't nothin
They smile up in your face
But they know that they be hatin
But it's cool, cause I smile right back
And I just use it all as motivation

(Hook)
Whatever don't kill you, my nigga
It make you stronger
Say life's a bitch, my nigga
When these haters on ya
I said whatever don't kill you, my nigga
It make you stronger
Say that life's a bitch, my nigga
When these haters on ya
(Rome)
Ain't nobody perfect
But somebodies worth it
How ya gonna judge me nig
And you don't know me nig
How ya gonna judge me nig
And you don't know me nig</pre>
