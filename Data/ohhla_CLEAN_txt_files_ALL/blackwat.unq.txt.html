(Dance with me)

[ VERSE 1: Unique ]
Here is a nation of black men, right 'n exact in
Nature, plannin to tear down the crack den
The population is increasin by the hour
This is the cause, so pause the rap shower
Many are called, but few will be chosen
Some will freeze at no degrees frozen
Stiff so don't riff, I think that you should listen
And you can splurge my words, I'm not dissin
In fact, I'm tryina teach the untaught a lesson
To understand, my man, this is the blessing
Accept it or reject it, but respect it
Shape and mould the knowledge and you perfect it
So turn your radio up one notch
And if peace is in your heart you are part of the Blackwatch

So won't you all just
(Dance with me)

[ VERSE 2: Unique ]
This is a movement of righteousness, civilization
The planet Earth is the turf of this nation
Where brothers and sisters all join together
To form a unit that's tougher than leather
But in the outcome we'll be victorious
And all thoughts emerge to vanglorious
As it was said, get the red, black and green and
Don't miss the point, just understand the meanin
Don't ask me why I chose to rap in this
Style cause my cause is for love, peace and happiness
Unique will triumph over negativity
Cause I glow and flow with versatility
Teach the children and let them lead the way
Or else their minds'll corrupt and they'll run astray
Let the latter remind us of how it used to be
No matter what you take from them they'll have dignity
Some consider the great one as an advisor
But each generation will grow, we gettin wiser
Eternally we're wounded, cause life is like a cavity
Mankind's hands defy the laws of gravity
Stole unfinished science to pierce the Earth's atmosphere
Now the world is a ghetto when we are trapped in here
Splittin the planet in half by an equator
Stripped of our religion and robbed by the traitor
Now we're stealin and killin from each other
Everybody's fiendin and screamin, word to the mother
People used to have it, now they lost it
Gave their life to crack, that's what it cost
Your money, your life, your kids or your wife
You're better off makin a choice between a gun and a knife
My brother, we are free but some are not aware of it
And that's why the Blackwatch is takin care of it

[ Professor X ]
No justice, no peace
Vanglorious
This is protected by the red, the black and the green
With a key
Sissyyyy

[ VERSE 3: Unique ]
We stand tall cause we all know our history
That's one of the reasons I urge you to listen to me
What's really makin life so bad
Is they assassinated every black leader we had
Just to show and prove that Allah was god
He sent a prophet by the name of W. D. Fard
Things would probably be different if Malcolm X was alive
But he was killed in the year of 1965
Pause, our cause is Islamic
All praise is due to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad</pre>
