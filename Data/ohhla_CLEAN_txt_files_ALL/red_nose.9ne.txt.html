[Verse 1]
I got my face painted, crazed aint it 
That a black dude lookin like he got a white tattoo
People thinkin that he way tainted...by evil 
Treat you like fecal wanna beef you when they meet you
People perceive you to be lethal when you aint see through like tissue 
I feel like the industry givin me vivid stupidity 
When they distribute these fictitious sissys 
When I rip it so serious and wickedly...No forgiving thee
When I claim the strange everybody tellin me I'm insane with bane
I'm an independent, talented individual, 
But workin with the industry is a reindeer game
And they call me rudolph the red
They know I don't rip off the mic but I chew off the head
Spit it at the PDs and DJs and VJs who be gay
you fakin, you get threw off a ledge
If you tough we snuffing, Homie trust me nothing
Is worse than knowing your beautiful but get treated like an ugly ducking
So I'm Rocky Dennis, but I'm so polished nothing can stop me in this
Bad in the brain and the good is not replenished
The fakers who imitate me and mock me, finished
We check the mill, yes its real
Through Strange I dont need ya major label record deal 

[Chorus]
Thats real people act a different way with me
I feel that nobody wanna play with me
Thats ill cuz they treat me like a stain on they clothes 
The industry and my foes
They treat me like I got a Red Nose Red Nose Red Nose 
They put me down and treat me like I got a Red Nose Red Nose Red Nose 
Dont make me clown and have to go put on my Red Nose 

[Verse 2]
They tend stray away from me because I'm different 
And its been this way with me ever since I was an infant 
Other kids were jealous, they say the look off in my eyes seen hellish
Never knowing later in life I would relish, 
The thought of me ballin living my life and sell it
I blame it on program directors, go and request us no damn selector
But if you got a lot of dough man they bless ya, sure can depress ya 
When you knowing that there aint nobody better mayne
Stuck off in the cold when the bad weather came 
Now they gotta see me livin it up and cheddar gain 
Coming from forever pain till it never rains 
So I throw up the finger, to everybody who got a tore up demeanor 
Thinkin that Tecca Nina was sho nuf a dreamer 
But the flow is so heavy that it could show up Katrina
Now its time to take it, and you all must face it 
Tech Nina is sacred, all you hating fagets couldnt see me with lasik 
Red Nose, the leader so follow, you gotta get ready to get up and go is the motto 
Made it through everything negative, bravo
The money thats coming to me feel like I won the lotto
Now I'm bout to put the slay on auto 
Swoop down on the djs tell em all to quit the replays 
Make em put Tecca Nina in the Sorado

[Chorus]
Thats real people act a different way with me
I feel that nobody wanna play with me
Thats ill cuz they treat me like a stain on they clothes 
The industry and my foes
They treat me like I got a Red Nose Red Nose Red Nose 
They put me down and and treat me like I got a Red Nose Red Nose Red Nose 
Dont make me clown and have to go put on my Red Nose 

[Verse 3]
I'm comin and drivin my short bus 
With this nose I dont need to torch up
Bustin through like the industrys Porsche
coming after who didn't support us
Rip down it's bleachers I blew up cause my sound it ether
Underground up and found this creature
Not scared of a nigga with clownish features 
I'm makin a name outside your mainstream
Real, it wasnt an insane dream 
from the beginning I really came clean
You about to see Strange gleam, take it over in gain green 
Strange Music and RBC along with Fontana we gon change things 
Now its so funny cuz with money I can fly away
Or leave them haters off in the deepest darkest hide away 
Why do they do me wrong? my music truly strong
Because I'm different all you cowards wanna shoo me gone 
Yes this is Strange year, worldwide fames near
But the games queer, sometimes I feel like Rudolph the reindeer
And the music they said blows, is on top and the cred grows
You're gonna have to open up the door for the bro with the Red Nose 

[Chorus]
Thats real people act a different way with me
I feel that nobody wanna play with me
Thats ill cuz they treat me like a stain on they clothes 
The industry and my foes
They treat me like I got a Red Nose Red Nose Red Nose 
They put me down and and treat me like I got a Red Nose Red Nose Red Nose 
Dont make me clown and have to go put on my Red Nose</pre>
