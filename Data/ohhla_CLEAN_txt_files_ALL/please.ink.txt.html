Please...
Don't hate on me
Please...
Don't hate on me
Please...
I know I shine
So bright...
Please...
Don't hat
Please...
Don't hate on me
Please...
I know I shine
So bright...

They made cause I'm shining
Can't see what the time is
I ain't worried about comments
More worries about when the money coming
Found money when I show up
And I'm about to blow it all like I roll up
Geico Sonar
Make this shit look easier than Rosa
Smell the aroma
One hit will put you in a coma
All my brothers with me like Jonas
And I paint a perfect picture like Mona
Yeah... that good
And you ain't gotta tell me that I rap good
I'm just trying to stay humble
It's kinda hard when you shine like the sun do

Please...
Don't hate on me
Please...
Don't hate on me
Please...
I know I shine
So bright...
Please...
Don't hate on me
Please...
Don't hate on me
Please...
I know I shine
So bright...

And you can never shame me
I got them going nuts, praline
You know it's going down, cave in
Don't worry where I'm from I'm an alien
And we ain't in the same league
Alumni, we the A-Team
You can find me anywhere the grass grow
Face that, we don't even pass those
Toast to the assholes
Shit, you can smell it with the bad clothes
Break down, roll up
Burn one, roaster
Speed through the city in a roadster
Bad bitch you can put in on a poster
No I am not a poser
So bright I can shine like I'm supposed to

Please...
Don't hate on me
Please...
Don't hate on me
Please...
I know I shine
So bright...
Please...
Don't hate on me
Please...
Don't hate on me
Please...
I know I shine
So bright...</pre>
