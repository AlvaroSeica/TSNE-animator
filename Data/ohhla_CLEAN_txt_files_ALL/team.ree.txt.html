[Chorus]
Who got that drink, I need that drink (that drink)
Who got that smoke, I need that stink (that stink)
Oh that's yo' bitch? That girl fuckin' the team (the team)
Oh that's yo' girl? That bitch fuckin' the team (the whole team) [x2]

[Verse 1]
Who got that drink, who got that drink?
That shit that you stir up and it turn pink
I'm on my block and bitch I do my thing
Catch a opp in traffic we gon' do our thing
Catch me off in traffic bitch I got that nen, that dean
Pull up on yo' block fuckin' lay the scene
Pull up on yo' block and make a bitch sing
300 shit and OTF, bitch that's the team, what you mean?
Hit a nigga with the macs, we don't really give a fuck
We out here on the grind and we'll stick yo' ass up
Yo' ass a stain boy, you ain't nothin' to us
You might as well give it up when we runnin' up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ride around with 30's, them my favorite things
Fuck that drink we out here and we ain't playin' the same
Better make it count, don't shoot if you ain't got aim
My niggaz on yo' ass and best believe they got aim
We ain't playin fair, that mean that ain't the same
Different leader, different league, that's a different gang
OTF and 300 that's what I claim
GBE and 300 that's what I claim, you a lame
Get banged, where I'm from we got aim
Shoot a nigga with that thing and run up in his thing
You a stain, my niggaz they no fuckin' lames
We don't play no games, we only aim for the brain

[Chorus]</pre>
