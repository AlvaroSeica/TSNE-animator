[ Romeo JD (&amp; Romeo Knight) ]
Here we go
I'm a lover y'all
I'm a lover y'all
I do my thing correct and undercover y'all
Boogie?
(I'm a lover y'all) Hah?
(I'm a lover y'all) Alright
(I do my thing correct and undercover y'all, Rome)

[ Romeo JD ]
Now my name is Romeo and it's not hard to bear it
Cause I earned it and I learned it, if the shoe fits, wear it
So I try to do what I'm supposed to
And find a girlie that I wanna get close to
But I be chillin, I don't wanna sound absurd
Cause if you do it every night, it plays out, word
Won't get her drunk cause that's no fun
She'll wake up in the morning saying, "What have I done?"
Oh, stop frontin, have a seat and just chill
Admit it that you did it at your own free will
That's why I try to look em dead in the eye
And make sure before we go beddy-bye
That there's a proper age to be at this stage
I'm protected well before I engage
Then take my chance on a night of romance
And make your spine unwind while we slow-dance
Be you French or Spanish, somehow I manage
To love and be loved without takin advantage
But yo, sometimes we just don't know
When to keep it or when to just let it go
And I hope that everyone I'll ever met
Will not regret and hopefully will never forget
That what we did we did cause we believed we should
And wherever there's love there's good

[ Romeo JD (&amp; Romeo Knight) ]
I'm a lover y'all
I'm a lover y'all
I do my thing correct and undercover y'all
Boogie?
(I'm a lover y'all) What?
(I'm a lover y'all) Alright
(I do my thing correct and undercover y'all)
[ both ]
I'm a lover y'all
I'm a lover y'all
I do my thing correct and undercover y'all
I'm a lover y'all
Yes, I'm a lover y'all
I do my thing correct and undercover y'all

[ Boogie Knight ]
As I wrote this rap I said to myself
I'm Boogie Knight, I'm a lover
I could make love or be in love
But to be a lover is a subject of another
Are you a lover for the things you do in bed
Are you a lover for the things you do out?
I guess anyone can be a lover inside
So the trick out of bed's what I'm talkin about
Boogie Knight's a master of makin love
To the cranium with a simple ( ? ) word
I feed you like a baby, polish your nails for you
Or say a silly slogan that you never heard
A lover makes you feel comfortable around him
So I don't mess with your heart or your head
I don't wanna play daddy or treat you like a target
Just to get the things I want instead
I send flowers as simple tokens of affection
Read words and rhymes and become a love poet
In this cruel, cruel world of only fake lovers
Is Boogie Knight a lover? You knows it
Now homeboys you there, if you see other guys
Gettin over, don't go and do the same
Cause if that was your sister, would you be her lover
Or a dogger? The point remains
Now a dog is a dog, Boogie Knight won't ever be a woof
Just so he can get a girl
Cause there's herpes, AIDS, and VD
And it catches up to the dogs of the world

I'm a lover y'all

I'm a lover y'all
I do my thing correct and undercover y'all
Together
[ both ]
I'm a lover y'all
I'm a lover y'all
I do my thing correct and undercover y'all

[ Romeo JD ]
