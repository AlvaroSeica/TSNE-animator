(Mastamind)
I'm comin at ya like boo ya, I trouble shoot ya
Never had a devil step this close to ya
Chill cause it's cool, who you lookin at fool?
I do my dirt I got a dirty mind, come up off your jewels
Show me where the heads at, let me take a shot
Trouble's what ya got 'round the block at my spot
Drop dead basehead as I sing my slang
Can't hang with the rough neck shit? Use the exit
Be out my house as I make this house my home
I'm comin' from the zone where the bad guys roam
Life after death can it be? 
You're blind cause you can't see me
Comin at ya like

(CHORUS)(4x)
Boo ya, comin at ya like boo ya
Boo ya baby

(TNT)
Comin at 'cha like boo
"Boo!" boo "Boo!" boo "Boo!"
Boo "Boo!" boo "Boo!" boo "Boo!"
Swish, Boom! clear the fuckin' room
Sawed off shotgun Natas coming soon
In the book I gives a fuck about your crew
TNT's comin at 'cho ass like boo!
Body snatcha comin atcha if I catch ya
I'm a gat 'cha and just ratta tat tat cha
It's like that ch'all, "That ch'all", that ch'all "That ch'all"
Just pass me the motherfuckin' gat ch'all
And let me unload the clip and check a nigga for his grip
Cause this script is comin quick and don't trip 
I'm comin atcha like

(CHORUS)

(Esham)
Comin atcha like boo ya
Motherfucker I'ma do ya
And let the hollow points run right through ya
I never knew ya, so I'm gonna screw ya
Kick the voodoo and stick a pin straight through ya
I gotta break him off, biggie biggie break him off
Pops on my dick, wanna murder me I shake him off
And fuck the klans man, come and take a chance man
Ride with a psycho just like Michael
And if I hit him up, then I gotta get him up
Boo ya, boo ya, boo ya, lit him up
I never knew ya, so I gotta screw ya
Watch out for the killer inside me comin atcha like

(CHORUS)

(Repeated)
Boo ya baby!

Boo Ya, I bring it right to ya!

Boo ya! boo ya!</pre>
