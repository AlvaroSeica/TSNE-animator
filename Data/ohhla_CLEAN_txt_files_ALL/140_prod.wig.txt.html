[Intro: sample]
"So you don't mind taking..."

[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, Staten Island, stand up, this a 1.4.0. Production
Theodore Unit causing all kind of corruption
And your bird so lame, she don't got good suction
This a new year, I'm putting my hands in construction
Pumping out babies, for the tax deduction
Go against me, you headed for self destruction
Ask no questions, you guaranteed to get no lies
This is a building of the most popular, Starks Enterprise
O-4 delinquients, gats is a necessity
Fuck all ya'll labels that ain't wanna invest in me
My stocks is so hot, like the sun in the desertry
You looking for this shit, but I got the recipe

[Interlude: sample]
"We're coming out! Guns blazing!"
"Two of you... all of us..."

[Solomon Childs]
These for those muthafuckas, who get the feeling
That ain't gotta co-operate, time to eliminate
Surrender hostage, the election's over, the Theodore
Won in a clean slide, nuff gun powder, homey
To clear out a mall, hydro blowing
So give me the light, like Sean Paul
Music, to excite a block party brawl
And niggas don't understand, that they life's on the line
Til they get all crazy, sitting at the school
Waiting for they babies, cuz when it rains, it pours
And we the type to come through your walls
Like F-1 fifty Forbes, Starks Enterprise, Def Jam's first annual'll
Bring homicide, fourth and color
Like Jackson L. Samuel, to break you up slim fast
Like that bald headed nigga on them Tae Bo tapes
Don't have me drag you by your ears, through the project gates</pre>
