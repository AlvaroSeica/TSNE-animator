[ VERSE 1: Oddisee ]
You were there from the start
Taught me to be aware for the sharks and prepare for the dark
You kept a secret, you practiced what you were preachin against
Your inner demons were preyin and tear apart
You won't admit but you competed just a little a bit
I could tell, you'd be heated over little shit
Tellin me to quit tryin and get real
I got a little shine, you was like, 'Big deal'
I was pursuin dreams, steady doin my thing
You wasn't doin the same, you wasn't doin a thing
From my truest to a Brutus to a Judas
To who knew that this would happen
But the fraction was brewin, it seems
I should have seen, mistakin smoke for a little steam
It turned to fire, you burned me tryina ruin me
I won't even mention your name up in my bars
It's too close to the scars
But I'm sure that you know who you are

You know who you are

I ain't gotta name names
You know who you are

[ VERSE 2: Oddisee ]
And you were there from the start
Told me what ever I'm doin to do it from the heart
I was pursuin a dream that was cloaked in the cloth of the uncertain
Makin money music and art - and it wasn't perfect
You told me whatever's worth it was worth hurtin
Double edge seemingly sharp, rather unnervin
Still, you believed in a brother
I was starvin as an artist, you was feedin a brother
You could see in a brother what I couldn't see myself
When I couldn't see myself needin help
One reason or another I was tryina do it all
There's a lot of ways to fail, that's the fastest way to fall
Through it and after all you was with me, not against
You cheered me from the bench and now you're with me as I ball
And that meant I ain't need mention your name in my bars
You know you're close to my heart
I'm sure that you know who you are

You know who you are

I ain't gotta name names
You know who you are

[ VERSE 3: Oddisee ]
You were there from the start
Before you were even aware of the plan you were part
Of the scheme, grand as it could seem at the top
Man can only go so high 'fore he reaches where we can't breathe
But you know your limitations, you walk patient
While everybody start runnin for they plan B
Like a fire escape, but you stay in the kitchen
Let 'em sleep on they dreams, you just lyin awake
You stay eyein the cake, they say ou gettin greedy
And then they turn they side against you like their getting sleepy
Try to prevent you cause you ain't into what they 'bout
Get in your mental, convince you to take the way out
Please, let 'em try, let the 'em fail
Let 'em tell lies on you, let 'em be, let 'em see you prevail
Let 'em bail on they attempt to stunt a star
In any event be sure that you know who you are

You know who you are

I ain't gotta name names
You know who you are</pre>
