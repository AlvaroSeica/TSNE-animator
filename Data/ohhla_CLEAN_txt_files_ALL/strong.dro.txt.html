[Intro]
Man this weed strong as fuck
This weed strong as fuck
Mustard on the beat hoe

[Verse 1]
Smoke only strong weed
Roll only long weed
Fine ass big haze
She fuckin with my feng shuey
Weed all in my eyes, I'm finna cry
Weed in the brownie pies, Miley high
They trim and cut my iry
I look like a pothead
Ya'll niggas monkeys so I'm bout to go bananas
Everything I write flip flop, yea trumpet killin
Put deuces in the Phantom, west side of Atlanta
And the same nigga told you buy sell em and I'm sellin those
Uh, getting head in a buggy
Rollin up a dutchy
Bitch I want my number back, your pussy musty
Fuck that bitch, trust me

[Chorus]
Man this weed strong as fuck
Man this weed strong as fuck
Man this weed strong as fuck
Man this weed strong as fuck
Who got strong? (Who got strong?) Who got strong? (Who got strong?)
Who got strong? (Who got strong?) Who got strong? (Who got strong?)
Who got strong? (Who got strong?) Who got strong? (Who got strong?)
Who got strong? (Who got strong?) Who got strong? (Who got strong?)

[Verse 2]
Uh Shawty say she got that burnin pack
I'm too high to determine that
I'm geeked up off the chinese
Talkin to me, got her run it back
Come on, Charlie Sheen and all of that
Roll up a ball bat
I'm in a hotel with 3 lesbians
Where the fuck ya'll at?
I'm with the coalition team
Pourin up, get lean
Drive a nigga bitch cray
Til she need a Ritalin
Smoking out the back of cars
Man we just a bunch of stars
Black kush up in my cigars
I done have this plenty more

[Chorus: x3]
Man this weed strong as fuck
Man this weed strong as fuck
Man this weed strong as fuck
Man this weed strong as fuck
Who got strong? (Who got strong?) Who got strong? (Who got strong?)
Who got strong? (Who got strong?) Who got strong? (Who got strong?)
Who got strong? (Who got strong?) Who got strong? (Who got strong?)
Who got strong? (Who got strong?) Who got strong? (Who got strong?)</pre>
