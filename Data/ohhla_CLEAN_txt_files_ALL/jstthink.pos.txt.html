[Intro: Blueprint]
Hello everybody
My name is Blueprint
Welcome to my life
On the turntables we have
RJD2 supplying the sounds
Glad you could make it

[Chorus: Blueprint]
Just think, what if you can just
Just blink yourself away
Just think, what if you can just
Just blink yourself away
Just blink and the night, turns to day
Just blink and the pain fades away
Just think, what if you can just
Just blink yourself away

[Blueprint]
The perennial paradox is life livin in a box
Physical limited but the clock tick is infinite
Consistantly heard, so I'm imagining dawn
without the choir like collage and step my learns{?}
Started studyin rainbows for drinkin those days
When my vision blurs, when it occurs
I'll be broke as all, get up, envision infers
Another fly fashion crafted without the loss of a single life
See I'm soulfully singing this slightly engaged
Over-worked, under-paid
20 K student loan with no government aide
Face to face with life wanting to run away
Just seen some honorable death that noon
He's got Goliath tryin to hide inside the shade of a mushroom
I'm just another inmate, with a {?} of weight
Politickin in a poverty stricken prison
Not clean where we, consume gloom
Usin the 6 o'clock news as a spoon
Then wash it down with a tall glass of misery
But in slight of that I learned to fire back with energy
And if I told you every move I made
was over hot coals, you probably wouldn't wanna mimic me
You're too scared to risk injury
While I walk confidently, face-first in the imagery
that might not sit well if hangin in pastels
with flowers on the packaging just to make it sell
Even though I know it's prettier in pink
I'd rather splash some other colors to make you think

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Blueprint]
Just think, just think
Just think, just think, just think

[Blueprint]
I was born to fight against time and punch hard until my arms tire
Prayin for the day that I retire
With a smile greeted by God he's throwin in the white towel
While competitors growl at my lack of hunger
I did invite it when I felt myself goin under
I was too bitter to remember what manages my mind
You see I'd rather be blind
Standin with my eyes covered by the hands of time
Livin life in the paradise of pasttimes
where rainy days are chased away by the sunshine
But instead, the blackest clouds
constantly follow me overhead with no intermission
They're reigning nightmares
Makin it impossible to act they're not there
So with each downfall I see my sanity
take another step towards the front door
A little bit closer to leavin me than the time before
Life is a bitch and days are child support
And that makes my dreams
Children that I really can't afford to abort
Left to sort through the chaos
The cluttered mess that covers the desk of my day job
invites me to come into the office on my day off
with no guarantees that bein dedicated pays off
I guess it's all about who you know
And since I won't make brown-nosing business as usual
I've gotta get used to this
Glass ceiling that sits just above my cubicle

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro: Blueprint]
Ha ha, just blink yourself away
Just blink yourself away
Just, blink yourself away
Blind your, self away
Just blink</pre>
