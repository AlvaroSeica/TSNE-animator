Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ohh
baby baby baby, I would do anything for you

I know that you've got somebody else in
your life (I do)
but I can't help the way I feel
I'm going insane without you here
and I know she will never let you go
so I cry myself to sleep thinking of what we could
have been if you loved me

I remember when we started, like love at first sight
I was crazy for your kisses and your lovin every night
they said we wouldn't make it, but we still stuck it thru
my world was incomplete if I wasn't right next to you
and I've heard it said, that all good things come to an end 
but you tore life to pieces, when you ran away with him, why?
my mind was lost and I just couldn't understand - I'd give the world
for ya girl, ready to die right then but maybe what we had was
just a big mistake, and sometimes love slowly turns into hate
I gave it all because of you, lost it all because of you, and after
all this time, I think I'm finally over you

Baby I wish, that had never let you go
Its like I hate myself when I realize, that I was just so blind
to know, and I know she will never
let you go so I cry myself to sleep
thinking of what we could have been if you
loved me...

Girl its not that I dont love you deep inside I always will
but you lost all my trust
and I can never feel
the way I did, before you ever told me about him
you was like my hidden treasure, my special little Gem
now you say you've realized that you belong with me
but the only thing I've learned is you will always lie to me
once a Liar always a Liar, thats what people say
how can I trust the bridge that let me fall into my worst days
my worst nights, like fallin off the edge of life
like being stabbed in the heart, with a hundred knives
they say that time heals the pain but I'm still waitin for that day
Im tired of lookin thru your pictures every day
and now I see you face to face
must be that smell on your body
those lips that I can almost taste
I start to wonder - if we had a second chance
would you do the same thing to me again!

baby I wish that I had never let you go
It's like I hate myself when I realize
that I was just too blind to know, and I know
she will never let you go so I cry myself to sleep
thinking of what we could have been if you loved me...

I just don't know what to say girl
you know after everything that happened
I just can't start all over
Im sorry girl!

Ohh you Ooo
baby baby baby I would do anything for you</pre>
