[Intro]
{*heavy breathing*}
Did you miss me?
Awww yeah! What, what
MC Vagina's right back in this bitch
2009 is the year I recorded this song
Still not loving police 
Still got love for the vaginal crease
Player haters beware, because...

[Chorus]
Guns don't kill people, uh-uh
I kill people {*ch-ch*} with guns (Pow!)
Guns don't kill people, uh-uh
I kill people {*ch-ch*} with guns (Pow!)

[Jon Lajoie]
Hey punk-ass gangsters, what you're looking at?
You think you can front on me, you better watch your back
Because I have a lot of guns and I can shoot them good
I'm a menace from society, a boy on the hood
I'm invincible like Bruce Willis in the movie "Invincible"
I'm invisible like...well, I'm not really invisible
I'm bad, like the movie "Attack of the Clones"
I'm dangerous (dangerous), like fire in the nursing home
Old people burning! Old people burning! (Put your hands up!)
Old people burning! Old people burning! (That's kinda messed up)
What, what, you got a problem with this?
Maybe I should kick you in the face with my fist
Because on top of guns, I know karate and ninja stuff
So if you come at me, I'll trip you, then I'll suck your nuts
I-I mean I'll punch your nuts, sucking them would be gay
and I'm totally not gay, I'm all about V-A-G-I-N-A (WHAT!)

[Chorus]

[Jon Lajoie]
If a guy messes with me, I shoot him with my load
All over his chest and face and down his throat
'Cause I don't give a fuck, I'm crazy, like Mel Gibson
..No, wait, that just makes me sound racist
Listen, I buy a lot of expensive things because I have a lot of money
You can't afford expensive things 'cause you don't have a lot of money
Ha ha~! You want these things but you cannot afford them
That means that you're not cool 'cause you're just a poor person
Stupid poor people! Stupid poor people! (I have more money than you)
Stupid poor people! Stupid poor people! (You can't even afford food!)
When I show women my money, they want to have sex with me
and they always have orgasms 'cause my penis is so big
25 inches long and 12 inches thick
I'm the Anthony Hopkins of cock, the Albert Einstein of dick
I'm The Beatles of cum shots, the Mozart of huge balls
The Anne Frank of erections... no, that's inappropriate
Everybody knows that my rhymes are really tight
like an extra large condom on my penis, that's right
My lyrics are like the movie "The Shawshank Redemption"...
...They're really good...

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I've killed so many people 
that I don't even remember how many people I've killed
But it's probably around seven... thousand!
2005 + four pennies, representing the Northside
C to the ANADA, bitch!
Oh yeah, women are actually good for four things:
Cooking, cleaning, vaginas, and their sisters' vaginas</pre>
