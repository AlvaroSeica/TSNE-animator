Artist: Pudgee, Tha Phat Bastard
Album:  Give 'Em the Finger
Song:   Keep Your Coat On
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yo, you ain't stayin too long
Keep your coat on, you gotta go
You got, to go
Umm, listen up..

[Pudgee]
From Queens to Boogie Down you know I can Boogie Down
From Mt. Vernon downtown they call it Uptown
You can tell it in the style of the rhyme of course
Born in Harlem, lived on the concourse
Wicked in the lyrical, roughneck individual
Denise Williams told you that it's gonna take a miracle
to slow the flow, though it can't be stopped
And Donnie Wahlberg's the New Kid on the Block (I know)
Keep clockin you won't get the time of day
Throw a clap I deserve an encore Fonda Ray
A standin ovation, "Rhythm Nation: 1814"
"In Control" like dreams (?) (you know that)
See it in his eyes and from the other side
Shalamar dead give-away, nothin to hide
Ain't nothin fair in life but it's fair to let you know
You ain't gettin too far so, keep on your coat
Keep on your coat

[Chorus]
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go SO KEEP YOUR COAT ON
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go SO KEEP YOUR COAT ON
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go SO KEEP YOUR COAT ON
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go
You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go..

[Pudgee]
Keep on your coat no more the cat stays away
The mice or men will have a very short stay (time to go)
To us of the new they give nuff respect
Be in the "Next Generation" just like a Star Trek (Captain Kirk)
And we shoot the knots you better play my team
Givin out black eyes like Tyson did Mitch Green
There ain't no slaves like back in the days
So John Wayne is probably turnin in his grave
Cause paleface tried to keep it all undercover
And didn't want to give credit to anyone of color
It was a black man's recipe, you know the Colonel lied
He had no idea on how to make Kentucky Fried (nope!)
But he will tell you that he did, if you asked him so
to keep you from knowin what he thinks you shouldn't know
White supremacists exist from coast to coast
But there's the young black man so, keep on your coat
Keep on your coat

[Chorus]

[Pudgee]
Seems like somebody got it all wrong
All along, you was goin on and on, sayin please put me on
(Please listen to my demo) To put me on when I wasn't no one was willin
And now I get congratulations like (?)
The, Gregory Hines of rap is tap-dancin
And you be givin me more Cheers than Ted Danson (Cheers nigga)
I know the deal on you we can go way back
You know that, so leave the baldhead thing to Kojak
Keep your coat on, you ain't stayin too long
And by the end of this song, I'm really hopin you'll be gone
Cause I don't think you wanna hear what I have to say
Spit more verses out my mouth than Andrew Dice Clay
So run along, gettin fronted on I'm too smart for that
Like Light(?) said on The Jane(?) Show, "I'm too large for that"
I keep it rockin yes I rock don't rock the boat
And on that note, it's cold outside - keep on your coat

[Chorus]

.. and I'm gone</pre>
