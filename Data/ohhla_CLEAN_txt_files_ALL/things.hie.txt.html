Typed by: UCIBtheG@softcom.net

Chorus: repeat 2X

All things, ain't, what they seem
You'll get washed; even if you're way too clean

[Opio]
I was ridin around the Lake gettin smoked last night
Seen a gang of businessmen pilin out the Scottish Rite
It was just lascivious, cuz ducked in the three-way
Givin those ridiculous handshakes to the PD and the DA
But I'm hip to the sign language it's just an exchange
of the blood brotherhood who remains nameless
But to me y'all famous, and I got game just the same
Man it floods my brain, ya can't frame us

[Pep Love]
They got plans, plots and schemes
Like a dope fiend tryin to get that ice cream cola
[Opio]
My nigga hold up, things is not as they seem
You get washed; even if you're way too clean

[Pep Love]
Deceptions inception and interception of our direction
is intertwined with what goes on in our minds
Take a look at your reflection
What you perceive is based on what you believe is true
Shackled and chained and thinkin you as free
as a eagle in the sky - need I remind you?
The pen is an inkwell, niggaz is slaves
Even if we not locked up, we on our way

[Opio]
They got plans, plots and schemes
Like a dope fiend tryin to get that ice cream cola
[Pep Love]
My nigga hold up, things is not as they seem
You'll get washed; even if you're way too clean

Chorus

[Pep Love]
I'm bent like a slinky, where the hoes at?
Just got paid, pockets on fat
Friday night, everything is right
til Opio hung a left then I seen his lights (siren)
But we "B-Legit" like "The Savage"
We da shit, got L's and a pocket full of cabbage
One time did a search and found we had scratch
Itched it and took us downtown
Matched ..

[Opio]
.. descriptions of two individuals who just did a bank heist
Small timin shanked the guard twice in his neck
A Purple Heart Vietnam vet
They test me and eye-witness fingered out Pep
So the next logical step was: I drove the getaway
Accessory to murder, court date set for May
Put my ass in North County on set for Pelican Bay
And since I'm not Orenthal J., I can't pay
Shapiro the dinero to get away clean
A nigga got twenty years though, know what I mean?

[Pep Love]
They got plans, plots and schemes
Like a dope fiend tryin to get that ice cream cola
[Opio]
My nigga hold up, things is not as they seem
You get washed; even if you're way too clean

Chorus

[Outro]
"Does anybody know what the situation is?
 Do you know what we can do and what we can't do?
 What we can say and what we can't say?
 I don't know that anymore.
 And I don't have enough time to go and research all the laws.
 So I'm in the position 
 that the only thing I can say about that is FUCKIT."</pre>
