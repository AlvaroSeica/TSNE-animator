This is how its goin down
Mechanic MO-Town
So sleazy it aint easy
Being cheesy
Use to be my boo-boo
Now ya just dodo
Milky brown like a yoo-hoo
Once upon a time did a crime in America
With the 17 shot glock Austria
Plus crush burn a hole in my knee fashion
Blaze it peddle to the metal mash it
Now 7 in my elli helly
Picked up another bitch straight to the tele
Bitch did me right soft like a pele
Plus hush crush sticky green of the smelly
Straight bombin on niggas like an Israeli
Rarely playin this game while I fairly
Merrily merrily life is but a dream
In my night here my boat row down the bloody stream
Infer-red beams follow me wherever I go
At night close my eyes 20 bodies to grow
Triple snakes got me wishin I was home
This is the East Side hellhole
Thats where I represent
Bloody money got my life on funny shit
Startin
Niggas go crazy like Martin
Im out my mind in this bitch on the day
For the dog lookin at me foamin at the mouth with rabies
I got a message for the thugs
Gettin pug
Get your grave dug
Get your bloody body drug
All title this
Suicidal is
With the chrome and my fist
I dont miss
Its the E to the S to the H-A-M
And I heard you tellin somebody you was hatin him
But the simple fact is you cant relate to them
Niggas cash come quicker than an A-T-M
Way too grim
Bitch get smacked with the tech 9
When I holla out real life plus respect mine
Crime is life, and life is crime
But what will life be without a real life rhyme
Niggas Ahead Time And Space
Cant be erased
Or replaced
With more shit that face dead body after dead body
Case after case
Still keep the tulle tucked down in my waist
For the radio disc jock I might pop
17 weeks till ya might fall off the chart
Cause I truly gots no hearts

King of hearts
King of hearts
