[Tech N9ne]
AYYYYYYY~!
One, two, three, spit it

Together we are, a powerful force
As one mind, body, and soul
Let no evil enter, nor attempt to reduce us
Because of the beliefs we hold
And with this love, combined with our strength
We ward off, pain and stress (READY~!) {*guns cock*}
Technician I am - wholeheartedly (AIM~!)
In life, and in death (FIRE~!) {*rapid automatic fire*}</pre>
