[Intro: Holocaust]
Yo yo, you get hooked like enemy
Walk-in freezer, yo yo,
Check out the fly shit, check out the fly shit
Check out the Ice Water
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Chorus: Holocaust]
Like a White Beach Cruiser on white walls it floats
Motherfuckers
Like a White Beach Cruiser on white walls it floats
Motherfuckers
Like a White Beach Cruiser on white walls it floats
Motherfuckers
Like a White Beach Cruiser on white walls it floats

[Holocaust]
'Odds Against Tomorrow', we sat at separate tables
Rats the size of rhinoceros in the stables
The silly old man went and hung himself with a cable
They found him with his shoes on the wrong foot, a fable
The skinny little pimp had cut her face with a straight razor
Girl from the gutter, I murdered another
We went in 'The Ocean' and we began to argue
I left bloody and blood flooded the water
Mean man Archibald Grey overachieving
Leaves in the sunshine, dirty shovels for evening
Starsky and Hutch met Cagney &amp; Lacey
The bloody old man meat market wasn't hasty
The rhyme was kind of pasty, great like Yogi Berra
While Arab Nomads pitched their tents in the Sahara
He had lit cigarettes for eyes
Golden unicycles, seals playing harmonicas
I laugh as I smoke on the hillside
Gun in the grass, get at me and we can still ride
I might sip a beer at Muldoon's Saloon
The man who left cigar smoke throughout the room

[Chorus: Holocaust
Like a White Beach Cruiser on white walls it floats
Punk motherfuckers
Like a White Beach Cruiser on white walls it floats
(Motherfucker)
Like a White Beach Cruiser on white walls it floats
Like a White Beach Cruiser on white walls it floats</pre>
