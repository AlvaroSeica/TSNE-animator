[Kung Fu movie sample]
We must not quarrel, we're in danger, It's everywhere..
Wow, you scared me
        I managed to escape from your blade
        but I don't know how
Though when this mission's finished
we'll continue where we left off
Haha, when this mission's finished
        maybe we'll all be dead

[Cilvaringz]
Do the mathematics, I teach discipline
Slaughter the innocent like Child Murder Bethlehem
Incinerate my thoughts in melodic war chambers
Innoculate the sick with fully-loaded clips of anger
Live a dynasty, a Lin Brother dynasty
In which I'll truly fight against synthetic honesty
Supreme Allah fight the Manchu with Dahlmo Darts
Swingin Swords bodies play an open card
Just when I slip in I hear flamin skeletons
The God Bobby Steels brings the Wu-Internationals
It be dramatically, heavy on the casualty
The prince Cilvaringz, I be the king of the dynasty (Ooh)
1-0-3-0 4 lords are called in
Meth, Born and Cappa, last one was Killa Sin
All these niggaz comin through
Slappin Swiss guards fire weapons from the Wu
Ignore the risk of being hit by 7 iron dragons
I threw the Faster Blade, my renegades be headin for the Vatican
The bishop he slap box with Eagles
A son of a bitch who contradicts with my Ezekiels
As for my peoples, I fight a mental dynasty
I was Born Invincible to save my family
cuz Satan lurks in everyone, every time
everyday, every man, every woman, every child
It was napalm, imprinted in my trademark
I broke hearts and necks with my swift Shaolin Style
So I travelled many miles to be raised by the kings
like the child of the Nile, peace to RZA, and I'm out</pre>
