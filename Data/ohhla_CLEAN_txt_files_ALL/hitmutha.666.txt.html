[Juicy J]
This ain't no game we bring the pain 
So don't you niggas trip (yeah don't trip)
Fall in the club with all them thugs
And 'bout five extra clips (five extra clips)
Deep always deep is how we comin' cause we ain't no joke (ain't no joke)
So when you hoes talk all this shit
We gonna cut ya throat (cut ya throat foo)
And let you choke not out the door the Three 6 Mafia game (ready for war foo)
Now I was pullin' a fucking gun
We out so throw them thangs
Don't hit that white
And wanna fight act like you crazy mayne [DJ Paul]-(yeah, bitch)
We know you niggas just some hoes
We lettin' our nuts hang

[Lord Infamous]
I wanna crack yo mind
I wanna get you hypnotized cause yo this scarecrow
Keep a mystic type of biz in every rhyme
You may not cap to the s's
Cause we young my time my flex
It's the futuristic and artistic mega plisto plex
I rack up many shots cause on my run colegri pop
I make sure that they get so wild they bustin' caps up on the spot
All around the planet rock the ghetto clocks don't stop
My nigga gotta take a deep breath
and keep on blowin' 'til they drop

[Chorus]

[DJ Paul]
We ain't gon' stop until some down people die up in the audience
Word up, push 'em to the floor
Put yo foot in his guts a sample, watch a fool get trampled
Shoot a pistol in the air, make it so security can't handle
The crowd they gotta bum rush before a few gonna get crushed
Crush crush, we got it buck buck (The Three 6)
And when the show's over I wanna see nothin' but bodies
On the floor, and they got no Three 6 probs (Surprise)

[Crunchy Black]
I heard, through the streets, that a nigga, had said, somethin' about that nigga
I think his name was Crunchy Black
But I walked, up to, his house I knocked up on his door
When he came to the door then I hit him in the mouth
And I knocked him on the floor
Then I hit him and hit him some more
Then I told that fuckin' boy
Shouldn't of ran his mouth about of them motherfuckin' prophet boys
Cause them prophet boys, we hypnotizin' all of ya'll
Gonna tear a rope around yo throat and drag you like you want

[Chorus]

[Gangsta Boo]
Why you smilin' in my face
Why you talks behind my back
Hittin' you up hittin' you down when I starts to attack
Never can't be faded
Cause this lady roll with right click
Now I'm talkin' shit
Call me misses mobb bitch
Smokin' automos all you hoes boutin' my damn self
Never hangin' with you skanks
Cause I'm bad for yo' health
Playa haters out yo' stars pullin' cars 'bout yourself
Leave you stankin' like some farts under the sheets hold your breathe (WHAT!)

[Koopsta Knicca]
See my cell is with them rebar,? ?but look at thee with these naw (naw)?
Naw naw that be my piece out on that block wood? from ?estaysah?
See I called up them niggas operatin' tellin me they
was stressed with you up on that house that up in here
Looking out there
See a tattle always tells, ?well freezies always smells?
Mayne mayne don't listen to ya'll yeah we just thank these boys in jail
Say, all she really cares 'bout her hair
Here she thinks she stabbs a rope around a hoe's mouth
Motherfuck with a dyke you betta doubt
