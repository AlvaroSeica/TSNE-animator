[Intro]
YEAH! {*echoes*} One two
Listen {*echoes*}
{"Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn" - GZA}

[Vinnie Paz]
It's no quality on the mic that I don't have
My hands punch through a rock like an Apollo jab
When I was young I used to follow dad...
And watch how he would handle more beef than a McDonald's ad
I'm from a time of Alpina glasses and Diadoras
Fuck around with me your family's gonna need a florist
It's no question who runnin rap, cause we the rawest
Hit your head with the thunderclap, you seein horrors
I love my mother to death for givin birth to me
I ain't even seein red no more, it's burgundy
All these bitches is just birds to me
And hearin of another dead cop quenches a thirst in me
Anything that is Godly is the reverse of me
The home of Richard Ramirez is like a church to me
I keep a razor in my mouth it's like a Certs to me
The way I cut your fuckin face is like a surgery

[Chorus]
Nothing's sacred anymore, take your last breath
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death
{"Sons are born and guns are drawn"}
{"Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn"}
Nothing's sacred anymore, take your last breath
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death
{"Is there life after death and if so where we go?"}
{"W-w-w-w, w-w-w-w, where we go?"}

[Ill Bill]
Black operation, black tie ritual, black magic
Black carpet event, on the Black Sabbath
+Black Helicopter+ black metal, black Magnum
Black Berkowitz in a cell with black Manson
My brain's strange from takin contaminated acid
While you be sellin your soul we assassinate assassins
Spray up weddings and funerals, splatter banquets
Bang automatic ratchets and broadcast the transcript
We starin down the barrel of another 9/11
Souls condemned to burn in Hell, far cry from Heaven
Blood money turn the most innocent minds to weapons
Turn children to killers carryin knives in trenches
Sellin crack in the rain on the benches with a vengeance
Make a dramatic entrance like the train scene in "Death Wish"
Spray automatics reckless, leave your brains leakin headless
Pulling out the heavy metal K in broad day and end this

[Chorus]

[Outro: scratched]
{"And then blood floods the lawn"}
{"Throwing a body on my lawn"}
{"Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn"}</pre>
