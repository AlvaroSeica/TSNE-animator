"Life's funny ain't it
 Cause I don't think this was my parent's dream for me"

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Cheah, Lord I ain't your best son
I ain't been to church in a while, but on that liquor I confess some
I missed a couple blessings, wasn't ready
I was counting money, but I swear I'll catch the next one
I did some dirt to be the fresh one
I lost some friends over ends, but I guess that's what I get huh
Chasing dreams that I could barely see
Shooting for the stars, when that's something I could never be
Maybe all the flash wasn't meant for me
Maybe I'm too real for this industry
I sit alone in this four-corner room
writing about life and how it goes too soon
Pimping these broads, fast cars and jewels
All in the blink of an eye I could lose
It's all good, love and pain
Some thangs I just can't change, I just can't change

[Chorus]
I can't keep worrying bout the things in my life I can't change
Dear Lord, give me the strength to fight the evil in this game
Oooh, I close my eyes and get down on my knees
Pray to the Heavens, protect my family
If I leave, that's good enough for me

[Big K.R.I.T.]
My girl think I'm no good, and she should
I ain't done much to make her think different
Late night checking chicks really wasn't effortless
I'm erasing messages so she ain't caught me slipping
I never really knew how much I loved her till she dipped and
decided she ain't scared of lions, tigers and bears
but she scared to be in love with me
How'd I feel that I'll sleep with every broad on the road I see?
Probably so 'dough, I ride solo
On a mission for some mo' dough, ball hard to ease my mind
Tried to call her and she picked up
Said she really can't talk, it ain't over, but she need some time
Now I'm in limbo, it ain't simple, yeah I feel her
Say she got a friend and word is she really dig him
I'm dealing with the pain, I lost her and I know it
I'm praying for the strength not to show it, seems hopeless

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I was just waiting on this moment in my grandmama' kitchen
An artist from Mississippi, like who would care to listen?
I'm southernized, countryfied, no doubt
I hustle hard, my slang raw, so what now?
Get it in by any means I said
Having dreams of the cream, for such things I've bled
Sweat and tears, potent 'dro and beers
Liquor helps me think, but I'll pay the toll in years
Women galore and, some were whores
They never fill the void, all I wanted was more
The company up under me was shady
Childhood friends turned enemies, they hating
A lot of folk done made it to hell, I know they waiting
for me to fall off and burn if I'm forsaken
We workers of inequity, Lord we knew better
It's hard to be broke and do better, father forgive me

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
That's good enough for me {*4X*}

[Outro: sample from the film "The Kid Stays in the Picture"]
"Nothing clicked, it all felt tired
 There was nothing, nothing fresh about it
 And we were looking for the unexpected
 Something that sounded new and what we were gonna be about"</pre>
