(Hook)
Message to you hoes that be callin my phone
Let me introduce you to my homie dial tone [dial tone]
Aint no need to call back (I can't believe this moha fucka)
Aint no need for all that
(2 times)

$park Dawg:
She keep callin my phone
Heard I got a deal now she all on my bone
Seen me on T.V. Now they all wanna bone
Greencity made it now we all ridin chrome, now back to the song
Stoppers, Boppers, Groupies and all that
Blowin up my phone, leavin voicemails and all that
Hit her one time hell naw I aint gone call back
If that aint straight pimpin muha fucka what you call that
I tell dem hoes fall back send ya boy a text please
Dear mr T-mobile  cut ya boy a check please
Ima let the tek squeeze if bitches keep harrasisn me
I know that they don't know me when I answer and they ask for me
I swear this shit has to be the worst part of havin fame
Boppers wanna holla when they know a nigga havin things
Phone bill crazy, I change my number daily
If you aint talkin money, dummy, fuck you pay me

(Chorus)

Young Deuces:
Ey bitch chill, you know I'm from da mill
I gotta keep it real, ever since I got my deal
Man my phone stay bumpin, shawty sayin sumthin
If she aint talkin head den sh, she aint sayin nothin
System stay thumpin, beatin like its King Kong
But she wanna tell me how she got me as her ringtone
Shawty know what we on, watch us make it waterfall
Broke niggaz don't even try it you aint got it all
Bitch I'm a Blockstar, hood nigga, youngin wit da bestest flow
I hung up on em why you leave a message for
Dey try to act like dey aint on my dick
Cause once I pull up in dat whip watch dey come out quick
I'm talkin leapers and dem jumpers, flippers and dem runners
Its obvious dey chosin cause dey beggin for my number
She actin brand new, nigga watch me fall back
Started talkin bout her life, I told her ima call back

(Chorus)

Streetz:
Da Da damn lil mama why you all on my line
You only callin me cause you heard I'm on da grind
You love the way the shine, you love the way I grind
Treat chicks like a ball team put you on a pine
All on myspace try to hit me wit a note
Got real salty when I hit em wit a No
Look mama my time cost money
And from the look of things you aint got none from me
Tryna call block like that's gone work
Hit me on the cingular and on da chirp
Let her talk to tone they got real aquainted
That chevy was black til I went and got it painted
UGK ridin dirty for real
Drama on da hood dats a great
I get money girl I don't play
But hold up my nigga tone got somethin to say

(Chorus)</pre>
