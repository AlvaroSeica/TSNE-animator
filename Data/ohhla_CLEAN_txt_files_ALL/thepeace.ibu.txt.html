Peace!
To my people in the audience
I'll get straight to the point, I'm not enjoying this
Stage that you're living in
Rage you have driven in
Up from the depths of Hell
Where are you sinning in
Life as a whole
Maintain control
Get peace, be the key, unlock the soul
To the Black, to the red, yellow, white man
Polish, Irish, Jewish, Puerto Rican
Palestinians, Iranians
Cubans, Japanese, illegal aliens
Expand your horizon
Open your eyes and
Organize unity - start realizing
You're illing, killing off one another
You have the audacity to say you're my brother?
Listen, don't say that
Sir I do not play that
Play me if you wanna son, and I'll lay back
In the bed, I'm fed, peace is lethal
Instead you stray away misled people
I feel ashamed to know you
There's nothing that I owe you
You let that phony, fake materialistic stuff control you
I'm the Peacemaker!

Peace!
Divine Force in full gear again
It's the Sir Ibu, it's that time again
To renew, review, reveal the mystery
History, which caused us grief, some of us misery
Black feet walking the beat of the concrete
Grabbed his walkie-talkie - "Yo chief, we got beef
Send the troops, the Army, Air Force and Navy
There's a lady with a knife and she's crazy!"
New York's Finest said that they loved us
And vic'ed her, killed her - said that is justice
If that is justice, I don't want nothing of that
Howard Beach with their radical racial attacks
Friday night is here, and it's a payday
Who would have thought of getting killed on the freeway?
Man, it's sick, it's crazy, I called it homicide
The world is corrupt, screwed up, this shit is suicide
That's the devil's game plan - destroying us
When you confront him with this, he start avoiding us
By giving you welfare, which only means "farewell"
Where is my real check? He sent it by air-mail
But the airplane - it got hijacked
He won't stop terrorism, but he'll stop Matt
Garvey, Michael, Jimmy from feeding hungry people
Sally, Maria, Jane from being justice seekers
Larry Davis - he knew what time it is
He didn't let 'em kill him, so he went fugitive
On the run with a gun, now he's locked up
But he's alive and well and not boxed up
Rumor has it, that I'm a troublemaker
But the truth of the matter -  I'm the Peacemaker!

To conclude the beginning of a peace era
The Peacemaker - Ibu is here forever
Spreading peace throughout the whole universe
Venus, Jupiter, Mars and even planet Earth
I'm not anti-white - nor am I pro-Black
Discrimination, racism - I'm not wit' that
There's only one race -  that's the human race
Don't even dis yourself - 'cause that's a disgrace
Walking through the ghettos of Hell, I see the savagery
It doesn't matter - 'cause me and my cavalry
Melquan, Shabbazz, Supreme and the Ice-T
The Dice Sound, Bilal, and Public Enemy
I'm the Peacemaker, peace is my creation
Peace in the eighth degree civilization
Building, adding on is construction
The purpose of my main goal is destruction
Of the wicked devil
Malicious, vicious rebel
Give me a casket, tombstone and shovel
If you're offended - or uncomfortable
That only shows you're the devil that I'm talking to
I'm not bugged, disturbed or Looney Tunes
Just a peacemaker - and his platoon
Armed with peace, blowing up beasts
Southern, northern, western, east
I'm the peacemaker!</pre>
