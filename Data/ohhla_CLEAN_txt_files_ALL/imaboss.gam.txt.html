[Childish Gambino]
Hey uhh, I'm Childish Gambino
And this SBTV
This is a little something
Yeah
Ay, ay
Ay (Maybach Music)
See I be ridin through my old hood, same old attitude
Chillin wit'cho girlfriend, why she always mad at you?
She be like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Only time that she quiet, when my thing is inside her
Don't you know I'm a writer? Yeah I sleep in her stomach
And I slip her a 50, just to keep her one hundred
Yeah, my swagger's so dummy; we so stupid, so silly
I watch them girls getting lower, than the kick in the Millie
Uhh Gambino, why you got a gold chain?
Cause girls only gonna see you when you stuntin, man
I'm comin back, swag on Rogaine
Girl lemme see you 2 Chainz old name
So hood, what y'all talkin 'bout?
Man I'm watchin Law &amp; Order on my grandma's couch
Eating Lucky Charms for dinner, loser to a winner
Swag so Clippers, me and Blake Griffin
Yeah e and Blake Griffin, why your goals drippin?
You ever seen ballas like us po' pimping?
Ha~! We gettin drunk like a Kennedy
Ha~! W stay fly like the end of Grease
Yeah, I got O's like CP3
Don't worry, don't worry, don't you worry 'bout me
I'm only worried when that period's on CPT
.. when that period's on CPT</pre>
