Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro - Tech N9ne]
(You know that there are billions of stars in the universe)
But the star had quite a difficult time shining amongst all the other stars
The year was 1994 when the star began his decent
And continued falling..and falling
Landing in an unknown place the star creates followers from underground
And the quest to shoot beyond the stars once again
The star begins in, Strangeland

[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
Ground zero crowned hero,
But ain't nobody ever heard the sound before I found me so competitive i
Never get the credit but get it when they was clownin lejo
Now we pro the brown people
Was on it for the moment but they frowned at me for
Layin what I was sayin didn't sound negro now people round me low down when
The beat go
Never will I ever stop or quit what I'm doin I'm gettin better even cleverer
I can hit then I ruin every competitor we et em poppin shit I be chewin em
Up ahead of ya excetera
Speed band is comin for ya now he's makin the industry sandwhich come enjoy
The flow with tech and the minasee damage gunnin boy ya know we shakin the
Finicky planet we've landed

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko]
We've landed, the stars have fallen from the heavens
Your thoughts will reign on this planet
The arts you paint on this canvas, your helpless
We've landed, the arms of fans have been branded
The god of 6's and 7's
Is the start of musical madness
We've landed

[Verse 2 - Tech N9ne]
Shootin for the stars lootin for the cars who's inducin pukin hootin for the
Bars
You get stupid groups of loosin juicin you for true but you recruit the
Youth ignore bizarre niggas
But ain't nobody fuckin with any of our niggas
And if you trippin under the tecca there are millas
You don't wanna fuck with the murderers gorrila war till the lord hit us
Scar nigga what?
Bitch I'm at the bottom and I'm comin to get at ya better get up in ya column
And I'm gonna diminish you when I spit I really gotta right in front of me
Timid, and I wanna present it
Cause I fought for everything I got it was not handed and nobody fed a
Nigga nothin when I was famished I'm bussin for life but not for nothin but
God damnit notice somethin beautiful just landed

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko]
We've landed, the stars have fallen from the heavens
Your thoughts will reign on this planet
The arts you paint on this canvas, your helpless
We've landed, the arms of fans have been branded
The god of 6's and 7's
Is the start of musical madness
We've landed

[Verse 3 - Tech N9ne]
I land at six feet under six feet
But every other ordinary people cant sleep
The badness we had dished back in high school classes, ya dealin with three
Faces of madness
Never been average with the image of a savage at the very bottom I'm livin
Under the maggots
But I'm bout to shoot em and really wake up the masses gas it an blast it
Have the upper class breakin asses
Upper class rapper, suckers ass packers, rougher tougher mother fucker spaz
Backwards
Kcuf natas gutter mash slacker
Tecca ninas what there lads after
Everybody don't wanna say what goes up
Better quit movin I know its bout to blow up
Thinkin when I hit the stars Ima slow up hold up

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko]
We've landed, the stars have fallen from the heavens
Your thoughts will reign on this planet
The arts you paint on this canvas, your helpless
We've landed, the arms of fans have been branded
The god of 6's and 7's
Is the start of musical madness
We've landed</pre>
