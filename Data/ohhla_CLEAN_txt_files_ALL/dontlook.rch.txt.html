Intro: Papa Roach, Pharrell Williams, Shay
[PR] Yo , what's up Pharrell how you feelin'?
[P] Good
[PR] Hey Shay, wake up man
[S] I'm here
[P] There's no turning back now
[PR] I know man I'm ready to go
[P] You ready?
[PR] Hell yeah
[P] Yeah, lets go

[Papa Roach]
We're the gladiators
Taking my heart won't be that easy
So send in your lies
I'll fly so high the birds won't reach me

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
So prepare yourself (ready)
Screw everyone else (lets go)
Cuz time is counting down (ready)
It looks like it's now (lets go)

[Chorus: Papa Roach &amp; Pharrell Williams]
[PR] Just Go
[P] There's moments when you've been cold
[PR] Don't look back
[P] Ages waitin' for you to fall
[PR] Never look back
[P] ????s come, ????s crawl
[PR] Don't look back
[P] Angels smile, so give it your all
[PR] Never look back

[Papa Roach]
Kept my eyes on the prize
The next step in my evolution
Is to realize (realize)
My life is just a crazy ride

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Papa Roach]
Well fold down the pressure
I'm not the type to stop until I'm done
Addicted with fear my skin
It's not the end it's just the beginning

[Shay]
Ready .. Lets go.. Ready. Lets go

[Chorus]

[Bridge] - 2X</pre>
