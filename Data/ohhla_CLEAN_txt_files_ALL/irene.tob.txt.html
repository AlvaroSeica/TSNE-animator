hush lil baby don't you cry, daddy's gonna sing you a lullaby
everythings gonna be alright, the Lord's gonna answer ya prayer tonight
hush lil baby don't you cry, daddy's gonna sing you a lullaby
everythings gonna be alright, the Lord's gonna answer ya prayer tonight

[Verse 1]
last night you had a dream you was the homecoming queen
today your 18, happy birthday Irene
quit school you had to drop out to raise your little child
(there doesn't seem to be anyone around!)
you got to reach up to touch rockbottom
the powers that be keep you downtrodden
Daughter of Zion - I heard your prayer
just cast your cares and please beware
of snakes - they come in all shapes and sizes
(Tempt you) - put scales on your eyelids
don't waste your sorrows they give you strength tomorrow(tomorrow?)
your calvary's about to come so
keep ya head up don't you ever let up
the storm will pass you'll be ready for the next one
(hey little girl with the pressures of the world on your shoulders
don't say that it's over)
I heard your prayers just cast your cares and I'll be there so don't you fear
(I said hey little girl with the pressures of the world on your shoulders
don't say that it's over)
I heard your prayers just cast your cares and I'll be there so don't you fear

hush lil baby don't you cry, daddy's gonna sing you a lullaby
everythings gonna be alright, the Lord's gonna answer ya prayer tonight
hush lil baby don't you cry, daddy's gonna sing you a lullaby
everythings gonna be alright, the Lord's gonna answer ya prayer tonight

[Verse 2]
Irene I carried you when you was too weak to walk
I took to you when you gave your heart to God
faithful and true, that's what I'll always be to you
believe in you, believe in me and these mountains have to move
you have dreams and aspirations(aspirations)
I knew you before creation your foundations solid
I will build you a palace restore your soul
you'll be in for any challenge, many storms on the way
better sharpen your faith, count the cost
stick up your cross, and wear it everyday
(?)rest in me(?), and I will give you strength
blessed is she, Irene who seeks my face.
(hey little girl with the pressures of the world on your shoulders
don't say that it's over)
I heard your prayers just cast your cares and I'll be there so don't you fear
(I said hey little girl with the pressures of the world on your shoulders
don't say that it's over)
I heard your prayers just cast your cares and I'll be there so don't you fear

everythings gonna be alright, the Lord's gonna answer ya prayer tonight
hush lil baby don't you cry, daddy's gonna sing you a lullaby
everythings gonna be alright, the Lord's gonna answer ya prayer tonight

everythings gonna be alright
