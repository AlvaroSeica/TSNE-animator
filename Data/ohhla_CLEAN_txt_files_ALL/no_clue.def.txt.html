Chocolate Tye Intro:
Yeah yeah we about to bring it to yo ass. Heru. Chop Shop shop what?

Defari:
Yo what you rhyme about a lot?
Are you that smooth cat pop R&amp;B body clot?
Are you that outer space off beat who fucked the beat up?
You know you think you so deep but you can't keep up
I can't fade it when I hear a lot of bullshit
That's why when I grab the mic I unload a full clip
Of lyrics 
Big up to Grams down in Venice
Defari start this shit Chocolate Tye will finish

Chocolate Tye:
Yo yo the lyrical dentist the menace
Fuck up more by the minute
Leave  the scene grinnin'
Defari got you spinnin' 
Money lavish

Defari:
Doin' damage 
So many below average
Not from Dallas but I roll with plenty of Mavericks

Chocolate Tye:
See bad habits leave you empty handed
Stranded and I can't have it
Wack MCs take this shit for granted and

Defari:
And ya lose get bruised when you come through

Chocolate Tye:
Puffin' blunts twistin' brews but still don't have a clue
Of what this amounts to
Strictly fam rip the program

Defari:
Peace to the Ro-gram 
I can't let no man withstand the plan in hand
Bonified Likwit fam
In the Barbershop I get the fresh cuts

Chocolate Tye:
So what
Ya wanna do?
This the last time I'm warning you
In regards to whom it may concern
I burn crews with loose screws
Choose your weapon or keep steppin'
Cause right now kid I think you slippin'

Hook: (x4)
And ya loose get bruised when you come through
Puffin' blunts twistin' brews and still don't have a clue     

Defari:
Defari Heru pure as twenty four karat
Black ______ like______ 28th the barracks
The rare kid, rare style
Up rock flare style

Chocolate Tye:
Comparing yourself to us is not fair child
This
Underground comp
Is guaranteed to pump 
And give crews exactly what they want
No time to front 
Come flyin' from the begin
For my ?

Defari:
I know kids weekdays to weekends
Don't front Quest hit you with the bumps
Nothing change I'm always watchin' for these shady ass chumps
You wanna face off?
You treble with the bass off

Chocolate Tye:
No dope beat in other words you don't even know me
Tryin' to show me different patterns like my Saturn
On the low key really only out to smoke me

Defari:
Can't hold me
Wack niggas think they can out flow me
Shake my hand then watch they man try to throw me
A beat, when he ain't got no soul
That's why everything I do I stay close to home
Like 20 inch chrome Defari splash on the streets bringin' heat
Surround myself with nothing but my peeps

Chocolate Tye:
Like Kings, Queens and diamond earrings
On a do or die angle like a bishop 
Turn the fifth up
Hiccup
Pass it to Todd for lyrical stick ups

Defari:
Get ripped up keep your lip zipped up
Get ripped up (tied up)
Cause all the long you was sized up
Surprised her 
Now your rides up
Brains fried up
Wake up 
Go take a shower take off that make up

Chocolate Tye:
All the spaced up 
Can't brake up unit
Chocolate Tye, Defari got tight flows like fluid
Through a faucet 
Remember paid is what the boss gets
