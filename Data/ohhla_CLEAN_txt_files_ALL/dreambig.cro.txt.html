[Chorus]
[Akon](Crooked I)
See, I remember I was just a loner
Looook at me
(I dream, you dream, we all dream big dreams)
(I dream, you dream, we all dream big dreams)
I'm on top permenantly, but we stay in the streets
And I won't stop bringin that heat, it's my dream, said it's my dream
Ohhhh.......

[Crooked I] Verse 1
I had a dream, I would rise to the top
You haters like it or not, Who number 1?, I got my eyes on your spot
The west coast treat me I like was 'Pac
Now all I need is the whole world to bang *Crooked I on your block*
I'm out the hood if you couldn't tell
I've been shot at, stabbed, and put in jail
I've been homeless in places you wouldn't dwell
Feel these words as if they were put in brail
I did not lose cause I knew that I couldn't fail
Now on this track, me and Akon are cellmates
My sixteens's so fly I call them jailbaits
And I'mma take us to the T-O-P
Put this on G-O-D, homie this C.O.B.

[Chorus]
[Akon]
See, I remember I was just a loner, hangin on the corner
Now take a look at me I'm, big bossin
Steady stackin chips, never thought I would see this shit
I'm on top permenantly, but I stay in the streets
And I won't stop bringin that heat, it's my dream, said it's my dream
Ohhhh.......

[Crooked I] Verse 2
Late nights on the corner, Crooked had them a dream
To drive a Maroon 5, call it Adam Levine
Never mismanage the green cause that's vanish and cream
I grind all night, am I man or machine?(heeeeeeyyyyy)
I dream big like I was Kareem Biggs
In my dreams all I could see was whips and mean cribs
Love my momma, cause look what she did
On her knees like, please God can you help me feed these kids
To my deadbeat father, Crooked's your child
You didn't raise me, you crazy, look at me now
It's like I'm solar, everyday your sun's gonna come up
Pops, if money talks, my pockets won't shut up
Gotta work hard just to reach what you desire
If you're like me, then I'm preachin to the choir
Amen, in my region I'm Messiah, eastsider
I'm the reason Long Beach is on fire!!!

[Chorus]
[Akon]
See, I remember I was just a loner, hangin on the corner
Now take a look at me I'm, big bossin
Steady stackin chips, never thought I would see this shit
I'm on top permenantly, but I stay in the streets
And I won't stop bringin that heat, it's my dream, said it's my dream
Ohhhh.......

[Crooked I] Verse 3
I had a dream I would win it all
When you haters get involved, you be dreamin and prayin to see a nigga fall
Wait a minute ya'll
I'm gettin paper from Cali to Senegal than I spend it all in the mall
I'm the rapper that the hood like to talk about
The one the onliners would love to to write a blog about
Fill a chatlog about, cats wanna beef in my city, whats that all about
Later I'mma dogg'em out, dog...I'm out, giant blur
Your eyes observe me, drivin ?????? flyin ???, its I and her
She's my fly hawaiaan islander and I'm her sir
She loves me, I never ran from nothing
Even paralyzed people gotta stand for something
And I stand on the block tryna get that green
Moneymachine go brrrrrr-ting, yarrrrrramean???

[Chorus]
[Akon] w/ Crooked adlibs
See, I remember I was just a loner, hangin on the corner
Now take a look at me I'm, big bossin
Steady stackin chips, never thought I would see this shit
I'm on top permenantly, but I stay in the streets
And I won't stop bringin that heat, it's my dream, said it's my dream
Ohhhh.......

[Crooked I]
I dream, you dream, we all dream big dreams
I dream, you dream, we all dream big dreams
I dream, you dream, we all dream big dreams
I dream, you dream, we all dream big dreams

Yeah...

It was all a dream...</pre>
