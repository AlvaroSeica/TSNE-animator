Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
'Cause ain't nothing but heartache
Still not amazed, at what you see before you
I can't go, I can't stay
Ooh, do tie, if we walk away
Don't you, don't you want somebody to love you?
Won't you, won't you need somebody to love?

[Chorus]
Don't even touch much
Don't even talk to me
Baby, free yourself
'Cause you're not the one for me
And it ain't no turning back
Ain't no more, me and you
Me and you
Me and you

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
See, I don't love you (Yes I do)
You don't love me (You do too)
We can't hardly get along, with the clothes on
Everything I say is wrong, listen
Hot in the kitchen; I can't take it
All dem lil' folks thought we'd make it
Ain't nothing left for me to do
Cut loose from me to you

[Chorus]
Don't even touch much
Don't even talk to me
Baby, free yourself
'Cause you're not the one for me
And it ain't no turning back
Ain't no more, me and you
Me and you
Me and you

[Verse: Tech N9ne]
I think we should stop..
Because I'm callin you from the studio askin' "You wanna see me or not?"
Being my beezy ain't easy, she won't see me a lot
So when you creepin', deceiving, please believe me I'm hot
Why do I have to feel like I'm begging you-
To be with me, puttin' me through this hell when I'm showin' you what Heaven do?
After all of these years, I never knew
You would back off and slack off when I had to move and stop your monthly revenue
Only wanted to love you but money seemed to be bigger
That's worse than us having sex, and you white, and calling me "nigger"
It's over baby, hope you get this message that I deliver
It never was about loving, it was what I could give her
It's crazy, crazy, (crazy)
I didn't hear from you in a year and found out you had somebody else's baby
No more me and you girl, I had to go
Hit the do', now the only time you see me is at my show

[Chorus]
Don't even touch much
Don't even talk to me
Baby, free yourself
'Cause you're not the one for me
And it ain't no turning back
Ain't no more, me and you
Me and you
Me and you</pre>
