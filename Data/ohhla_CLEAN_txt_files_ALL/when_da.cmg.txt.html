Song:   When Da Smoke Clear
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook - 2X]
I'ma shatter niggaz world, if they come my way
Then confess it at the gate, when it's Judgment Day
If I walk with the Lord, there's no man I fear
I'll be the last one standing, when the smoke is clear

[Lil' Keke]
Hush it up mark niggaz, I'm the chosen one
'Fore I po' you punks out, like a bottle of rum
And my soundscan pull up, from here to the East
Boost your game up rookies, I'm a lyrical beast
I'm a wolf you a sheep, and it's time I feast
And I'm hungry like a dog, that be showing his teeth
I'ma squash all beef, when the album drop
I'ma shit on niggaz heads, when I'm back on top
If these so called gangstas, wanna turn it to violence
Then God bless his soul, with a moment of silence
C.M.G. shoot first, make the pack divide
Front porch backyard, I'm still (by your side)
Don't fuck with Young Don, cause it's consequences
And you first on the field, but you die in the trenches
It's a grave or a sentence, it is what it is
This my street testimony, I've been waiting for years

[Hook - 2X]

[Lil' C]
I mash in the hemi, two semi-automatics with me
Don't get it twisted at all, Lil' C is not friendly
Bring any nigga you wanna bring, put him up against me
He might be bigger, but you ain't gon wanna see the ending
I fear no man, that mean nan nigga
So when the drama come, I don't shake I don't shiver
I don't cry about it, I just do my job
I'm married to the mob, if it's easy or it's hard
You don't wanna see a man, of my caliber
Get red hot, and go to shooting like Gallagher
Shit, cause that'll be a whole 'nother massacre
Like David Caress' shit, burning your flesh
I promise you don't wanna test, I got the Lord and a vest
To handle the stress, I'm smoking on canibus best
So when the smoke clear, me and my niggaz is still breathing
And you and your niggaz, is just bleeding

[Hook - 2X]

[Lil' Keke]
All black ski mask, with the gats to match
Automatic M-5, knock a do' off the latch
I'ma let you niggaz talk, while the currency build
Trying to make a half a mill, 'fore I sign a deal
Put the fam out of town, hundred K in the ground
Put your working boots on, my niggaz it's going down
Bullets at your grill, rain hard and heavily
Your click talk shit, now they all in jeopardy
Hate and animosity, I'm filled with anger
Sneak up on you niggaz, like the perfect stranger
Calm under pressure, and my click don't rattle
And I never lay it down, in the heat of the battle
I'm a soldier, ten toes down up in the mud
This guerilla warfare, can you taste the blood
Will the Don fold up, my niggaz it's no way
And don't make me have to trip, like Kyle Sose
