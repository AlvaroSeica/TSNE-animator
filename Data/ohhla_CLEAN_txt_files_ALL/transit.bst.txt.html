[Verse One: Beastie Boys]
Boys out pushing me
Friday night intimacy
Goin out to family gore
Smell the death through this door, listen
Yay yo-yo from the C.I.A., they're goin
Yay yo-yo what minority say, they're goin
YO YO YO! ... YO YO YO!

[Verse Two: Beastie Boys]
Branch off, twist in the wind
And I can't afford to pay the vig
And now I'm never late on Friday night
By a transit cop lookin to fight, he said
Yay yo-yo from the C.I.A. ahhhh
Yay yo-yo what minority say, they're goin
YO YO YO! ... YO YO YO!

[Verse Three: Beastie Boys]
Don't it fuckin hurt
A fuckin stupid roller fight
Now I'd rather jump than pay
But they're gonna book me anyway!!!</pre>
