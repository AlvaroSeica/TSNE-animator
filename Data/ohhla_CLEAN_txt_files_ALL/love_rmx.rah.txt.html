Pull up to the, lover, pull up to the bumper
Pull up to the, lover, pull up to the bumper
Pull up to the, lover, pull up to the bumper
Pull up to the, lover, pull up to the bumper, Baby

[Chorus]
Love, Till I get enough
Love, Baby fill me up
Love, Girl your love is worked
Love, Freak me till I'm dead

[Verse 1]
L-O-V-E
A playa don't like that, He must be crazy
Yeah, I said it
Down her pipes, That's where I'm headed
Now all y'all wanna follow
Found out this hard to swallow
She got me down uh
And stick that tongue up the uh
She do that freaky stuff
She like them toes and stuff
She is my favorite chick
You know you do that {shit}
Back at the hotel
Do a brotha up, Make a brotha wan go tell
She put that honey on it
Raheem got money on it
And all them freaks want it
Nah, Big, Well get up on it

Pull up to the, lover, pull up to the bumper
Pull up to the, lover, pull up to the bumper
Pull up to the, lover, pull up to the bumper
Pull up to the, Lover, OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Can't live without it, I need some
How bout doin a threesome
You, Her, And me
Both of y'all give me l-o-v-e
Let me fill them jaws up
And she can climb them walls up
I got them twin freaks
Unique and Dominique
They like a genie to me
I wish and they do me
What mo' can a brotha ask fo'?
[Can ya get down low?]
It's like a porno flick
2 tricks on my {dick}
I got some freaky ooh
They might just want my riches
So ya know I gotta be on my guard
I'm sayin to myself good lord!

Pull up to the, lover, pull up to the bumper
Pull up to the, lover, pull up to the bumper
Pull up to the, lover, pull up to the bumper
Pull up to the, Lover, OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH

[Samples]

Raheem gon rock
Raheem gon rock
Raheem gon rock
Raheem gon rock this party steady

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Moesha, Moesha
Do you want Raheem to beat ya?
US be a grade AB
A {nigga} don't wanna feel no teeth
Words of the pros
Mouth closed, Reach through the nose
Ridin down 285
Quit lookin {nigga}, Drive
[A yo, Cuz, Hold up]
[This love, This ain't chew the booty up]
True dat, True dat
But just don't have no {motherfuckin} wreck
Let's make it home
And you can get {yo shit sucked} all night long
That 22 style
You get head while I'm hittin it doggystyle
That's how we like it
As long as all you {hoes} don't bite

[Chorus]</pre>
