[Holocaust]
The Indian Chief's name was Spirit, made of fire and mystic
And depicted in red, like sea of angels, and hieroglyphics
Alcatraz zone, Al Capone, Chicago Valentine Day's Massacre
Shotgun spectacular, I fought a crusade like a Dracula
A Wrinkle in Time, they knew the law before they wrote the crime
The dark alien from Andromeda, that kept a skull and spine
You'll sound is dull, I recline, lantern
In place, a river church, the Highlander, find a violent kind
The sun rewinds, a drunken kitten chasing a butterfly
Sword to the eye, I disable and plate a nail down to the table
From dark realms and worlds, in the forest, I hover above you others blind
I'm the mutant Cable, I keep a gun you'll discover, my discography is butter
Chinese wine, leave you lost like Swiss Family Robinson
But some after time, missiles, rifles and shotgun
A cannon invented by Richard J. Gatling, my verbal obstacle
Is a gun shot abnormality, big, I dash like an athlete
Beware M.C., I have come to attack thee
Bad tragic king, another angel play a harpstring
The man of kung-fu or a gat spree, in fact, now come to attack me
Cherokee Vietname tomahawk red, bash ya head dead
Like a frozen daquiri, shot by a hundred arrows
Stabbed by four spears, I die, standing up laughing

[Chorus 2X: Holocaust]
We all are well known, a mountaneous microphone
An apple that came from Rome, might bite, and snap your bones
I'm The Holocaust, leak of losses, now the Apocalypse
Back from the territories of darkness, with a gun heartless

[Holocaust]
Down in the valley they are machines, they are Indians
Because I move a stone, you'll jar get swollen, I'm friendly like a Roman
Don blocks, I never blend in, when I rhyme, you looking at a pirate's emblem
The ghost of Humphrey Bogart, William Sattire in a oil drag world
I run water in my eyes to cry, my button on the side, Long John shirt from 1805
I'm live, there is a woman she kills a rat, she lives in a house on the hill side
Jesse James was a desperado, he was shot in the back of his head
A five o'clock shadow, dirty face clown, leaves you dead
In the gothic metropolis of the west, is Holocaustl, look, I'm the best
As far as dropping it, toxic neurologist, now the Apocalypse
Tore a gun, some kind of a man, who tried to civilize the human family
Thorough out, the populas, this is Warcraft, the Green Lantern box, outlandish jar
With a gun, I wander the mountain side, star map
One time, my spine was broken in half like Batman
The headless horsemen, you flat stabbed
And you find yourself in a blue world and die again from a gun in my hand
You all burst into water like a bubble, a Hawaiian katana blade
Slaughters book binder toddler, fire, there's an enemy below in the water

[Chorus 2X]

[Holocaust]
The Egyptian beetle each you scandalous, or in lethal ice planet
There is a praying mantis, rap bastard shit, scenes of Atlantis
Punch you, and bust your fucking bandages
I came from the dark city of Los Angeles
Actually, a city built under Jack Sprat, dark monarch Thundercat
Spray you for the taylor's valor, Dracula spear, this impaler
Red/white/blue Indian paint light saber
Clever the man, he is a barbarian, he lives in the hillside
He thinks he will live forever, feathers in the hood
And aircraft bomber jacket made of leather
From the nether world, a bullet hurled putrid
A gun in the alternate future, is my weapon that severs
But at nine, you can never get your varsity letter
Never the less, dark side, inner stellar
The arsonist, who has become a patriarch in the dark from arsoning
To steal a book from the market, and later burn a barn down in August
The redeamer and a marksmen, you walk, Johnny talk with a gun in your back often
Or outlined in chalk wind, like a Mexican wind chime
The Holocaust to the lost, begs your pardor
My rhyme orbits and torches a small orphanage
He robbed the white feathers, bitch, it was written on his coffin
With no oxygen, I leap from a coffin and throw your corpses to the orphans

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
