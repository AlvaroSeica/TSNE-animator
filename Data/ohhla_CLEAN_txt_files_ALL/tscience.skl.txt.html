[Verse 1]
All you sucka DJ's take heed to this installment
Or get your face augmented
Celph Titled spit raw sentences, Skully freak the instruments and all that
Weak niggas fall flat without they slip mat, bangin' on wax
Got your neck hangin' from racks
Up in your studio with flamethrowers erasin' your DATs, it's serious
You ain't never in the DJ booth
You spinnin' parties at gay clubs in your birthday suit
When my microphone is on, my tracks get felt
"While the Technics spin, the wax is on the belt"
