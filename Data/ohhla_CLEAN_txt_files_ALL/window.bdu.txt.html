[Erykah Badu]
Hey..
Heeeey...
Ohh, ohh, ohhh...
{*scatting*}
...fell in love

So, presently I'm standing
here right now, you're so demanding
Tell me what you want from meeeeee... 
Concluding, concentrating on my music, lover, and my babies
Make me wanna ask a lady for a ticket outta town...

[Chorus]
So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody, next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around, and a safe touch down
Can I get a window seat? 
Don't want nobody, next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye byyyyye...

Ohh-ohh...oh, oh...
Ho-ohh, ho-ohh, ho-ohhhhhh...
Ohh-oh-ohhh-oh-ohhhhh 

But I, I need you to want, meeeeeee...
I, need you to miss, meeeeeee
I, need yo' atten-tioooooon, yes
I need you next meeeeeee, heh
Oh I-iiiii, I need someone to clap for meeeeeee (mm-hmm)
I need your direct-iooooooon
Somebody say come back 
Come back, baby come back
(I want you to need me)
Come back, come back, baby come back {repeat 3X}

So, out my mind I'm tusslin'
Back and forth 'tween here and hustlin
I don't wanna time travel no mo'
I wanna be here, my thinkin...
Say, on this porch I'm rockin
Back and forth like Lightnin' Hopkins
So if anybody speak to Scotty
Tell him, "Beam me up!"

[Chorus]

Ohh-ohh...oh...
Ho-ohh, ho-ohh, ho-ohhhhhh...
Ohh-oh-ohhh-oh-ohhhhh 

But I, need you to miss meeeee
I, need somebody come get meeee, oooh-oooh-ooh
I, need your attent-iooooon, yes
and I, need your energy, and I do
Ohh, ohh, I-EIE, I need someone to clap for meeeeeeee
and I, need your direct-iooooon...

Sombody say come back
Come back baby come back
I want you to need me
Come back, Come back baby come back {repeat 3X}

[Chorus]
So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody, next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around, and a safe touch down..
Ohh, ohhh-ohhh, hey...
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye byyyyye...</pre>
