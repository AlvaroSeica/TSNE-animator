[Mike Jones]
The world finna know Mike Jones mann
Mike Jones! (Mike Jones)
Swishahouse! (Swishahouse)
Come here Watts (Come here Watts)

[Chorus: Mike Jones]*=chopped up 2x

Purple purple* drank I'm a pour up
Got the rap game sowed up
see my see my* grill they like hol up
invisble set princess* ss ss

[Mike Jones]
Hoes hoes* peep at me as I creep up the block
doughfinned beep me when he need some rocks
add 20's subtract the top
I'm pimpin hard in the parkin lot
screens fall when I lean in the truck
candy paint four screens on buck
no game needed to pull a slut
jus open mouth and show princess cuts
I pack a nine at all times
I shine alot cause I grind for mine
why hate on me you far behind
you wastin time by talkin down
you considered trash and I'm in my prime
you feelin bad and I'm feelin fine
cause "Who Is Mike Jones" coming
"Who Is Mike Jones" coming

I get you crunk when I open my mouth
my diamonds shine when I talk
I spit a verse then head straight to the vault
cause Mike Jones cant take a loss 2x

[Chorus]

M-O-B till the day I go
got a range rov on 84's
on the microphone I shine and glow
I'll scream my name till the day I go
I hit the scene lac candy green
or candy blue when I'm wit my crew
I represent we drank and screw
I represent we drank and screw
Michael Watts he choppin it up
cocaine I'm rockin it up
yo gal fine I'm knockin her up
yo gal fine I'm knockin her up
I got a plan
Got in damand
then I hit the road and start stackin grands
I'm runnin the game wit my master plan
I'm runnin the game wit my master plan
22*2813308 zero zero four
here the number you can hit me on
when you call ask for Mike Jones
2813308 zero zero four
here the number you can hit me on
when you call ask for Mike Jones

[Chorus]

purple purple* drank I'm a grip and sip
anythang illegal you know I'll flip
I roll slab wit my pistol grip
diamonds shine behind my lip
I hit the club 100 deep wit 100 sweets and 100 freaks
on the mic you cant compete
cause Mike Jones is in the streets
I'm grippin grain switchin lanes
causin pain in the turnin lane
in 7 months I'm runnin the game
just ask the streets what is my name
I'm grippin grain switchin lanes
causin pain in the turnin lane
in 7 months I'm runnin the game
just ask the streets what is my name</pre>
