[Hook]
Stupid bitch
Talking shit when I'm gone
why she always in his face
He's my man understand
That I'ma have to hurt you for him
	
Bitch talkin shit when I'm gone
Why she always in his face
He's my man understand
That I'ma have to hurt you for him

[Verse 1]
Now she don't know anything about me
And how I get down
She heard that I'm a sweet R&amp;B bitch
but never been to my side of town
I know a couple grimy bitches
that a put a stupid ass in stitches
All on a count of me
But I don't need nobody to snatch that stupid bitch

[Hook]
Stupid bitch
Talking shit when I'm gone

Bitch talkin shit when I'm gone
Why she always in his face

[Verse 2]
He tells me everything about you
But you think you slick
I hope you know that every time you wanna Kiss

and I don't wanna have to witness
nobody diggin up no brand new bitches
All on the strength of me bitch
Bitch I don't need nobody to snatch you stupid bitch

[Verse 3]
I'm bringing this right to your hood
Telling you for your own good
stop playing with my shorty bitch

Now peep out this situation
All this drama your facing
you don't want these complications
Bitch don't let it get that far
