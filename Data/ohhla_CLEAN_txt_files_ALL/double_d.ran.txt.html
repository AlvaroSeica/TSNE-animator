[Intro: scratched by DJ Ragz]
"I'm afraid, we'll be in for some hard fighting"
"Get on with it!" {*3X*}

[Random]
Check it~! Mindin my business the other day
When these punks punched my girl and took her away
Could've been some cats that I owed dough to
Called my bro, he ain't have no clue
I don't care how many chumps I gotta go through
No guns, no knives, keep it old school
Just fists and feet, so we hit the street
Back to back 'til the missions' complete
Runnin up on cats speakin no words
A knee to the face then I leave 'em on the curb
I'm well versed in the martial arts
But for some reason I only know two moves to start
All good cause though I'm learnin
I stay focused, determined, the blaze is burnin
United we stand scrappin
Attackin cats, crackin backs, the Double Dragons
What?

[DJ Ragz]
"You could never beat me"
"You know what I mean"
"Now we'll see what you're made.. made of!"

[Jermicide]
Yeah; I'm kickin ass, got my red vest on
I'ma get my flex on - broads and guys get a kick to the head zone
Abobo try to step and his chest gone
Two brothers walk the beat we the best known
We in the streets where your peeps catch a headstone
Without heat, got a bat, get your head flown
And anything around turn into a weap-on
You know I'm dead wrong
Like Lee but I ain't talkin 'bout the Press-On
Kidnapped Mari-an, see the man's redbone
Now we fin' to pay him back like a Krev-lon
Black warriors, blood ya lips
Me and my dude red and blue like the Bloods and Crips
Bobbin out though I never thought I'd budge for chicks
But here I am beatin domes in with clubs and sticks
Double Dragons, pants saggin, toe taggin

[DJ Ragz]
"We're gonna teach you a lesson"
"Get ready!" "We have something to settle yet"
...
"Let's get on with it!"

[Random]
Bloody knuckles, we scufflin, I got a hot tip
from the warehouse, not even a hop skip
and a jump from where we be, gettin it down
And some cat named Willie, I heard his name around
White slacks and his medium shirt
We approach him immediately givin him work
And now I'm face to face with my girl at last
But the look on her face made me worry a tad
Where you at bro?

[Jermicide]
In the warehouse, you suffer many losses
Get your ish tossed, big timin little bosses
Got the girl in the midst it was nuttin
Case getting curious like Benjamin Button
All of a sudden talking 'bout how we was smuttin
Back in the day (before me and you was cuttin?)
Now we gotta bang it out for your thang? (Whoa) Yeah right
Must've bumped your brain; me and man airtight

[DJ Ragz]
"By now you must be about exhausted"
"But I've seen your techniques"
"You won't be any problem now"

[Random]
Whoa whoa let me get this straight man
So we've been travellin all up and down the alleyways
through the woods, through the forests, through the... trees
Through the, factory and all that
And then I get here, and you, my girl tell me that
I gotta fight, my man, for you
Ay Willie man you can have her man!
We out man, I can save my quarters
and get a bunch of head - we out~!

[DJ Ragz]
"That will do, for now..."</pre>
