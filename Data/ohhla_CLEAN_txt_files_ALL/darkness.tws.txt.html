[Intro]
F6 (F6) the perfect storm
A rare event or situation in which ideal circumstances
combine to create the worst case scenario
ending in infinite destruction, and total darkness

[Twista]
You don't wanna bring darkness into this...
You don't wanna bring, you don't wanna, you don't, you don't
You don't wanna bring darkness into this...
You don't wanna bring, you don't wanna, you don't, you don't

[Interlude: Twista]
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this.. darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this.. darkness into this
You don't wanna bring, you don't wanna bring
You don't wanna dark-darkness into this

[Dawreck]
Nigga got me fucked up
Kickin on my horse, sound like I won't leave a nigga punch drunk
Runnin 'round talkin all tough chump
Fuck around and end up gettin stuffed up
Better believe it if a nigga threaten ninety fuck
Beat him up cause a nigga tryin his luck
Heat him up while the nigga tryin to duck
but when I line him up, I'ma be firin 'em up
Like two lines of dust I'ma be two cock wit it
Glock cocked aimed and ready to pop wit it
Shots gon' ring, get ready to drop mayne
Already done got aim, better drop that fifty
And if a nigga thinkin that I'm kidding
I got a slug wit'cha name, well then homie you can come get it
And you the nigga to blame cause you the one that did it
When niggaz start shit reckon nigga that I'll finish
Givin shots to the face like a dentist
I'm a menace and I'm makin sure a motherfucker feel it
Soon as a nigga get into my business
only got a couple seconds 'til his blood start spillin
Fuck y'all figure, Wreckless, I'm one of the coldest
Put a hole up in one of y'all bitches
Half y'all hoes, the other half snitches
Matter fact fuck it, all of y'all get it
Leave no witness, you fuckin with the motherfuckin realest
I be fuckin with them killers (killers killers killers)
Them niggaz on the blocks with the Glocks 
steady duckin from the cops drug dealin
He'll be thinkin that he hard 'til I hit him in his heart 
and his body fall apart like syphilis
Cause he runnin with a squad but I'm rollin with a mob
You don't wanna bring darkness into this

[Chorus: Dawreck] + (Twista)
(You don't wanna bring darkness into this)
You don't wanna be around when the Reaper comes
Nigga better stay up out the street when a nigga got beef
'fore you see me with the heat, just run
(You don't wanna bring darkness into this)
You don't wanna get into it with a nigga that'll straight black out
Nigga you don't really wanna take that route
Fuckin with a nigga that'll straight jump out

[Interlude]

[Twista]
Gon' talk that shit now
Automatic shots at the enemy while I'm screamin out "Bitch die!"
Shoulda went ahead and try to let yo' fists fly
Did you think that you would die while you was this high?
Did you think a street sweeper would make you look at the Reaper 
then take a peak at the death of your soul when it got cold?
Did you think you would ever just take a good look 
at the darkness out of a black hole when you got stole?
See me hooded, semi-automatic 
for niggaz thinkin they hard to the fullest
I'ma put it on the Mob I'ma pull it
Hollow points up into the chest and watch him slide on the bullet
Or chokin on the blood, tryin to get at it before me but I was quicker
I caught him open with a slug, in his shoulder was a plug
A little bit of itinerary out to the enemy 
just a token of my love and I hope his boy a thug
See if he charges, see if he ain't a mark
and see if he got the heart to do what he gotta go
(To do what he gotta do) Like he a G (like he a G)
You can forget about it~!
I'm off the chain like a fifth of Hennessy 
or like the piff be when I see 'em thinkin that my tip's sweet
Let your lips speak, see the clip leak when I flick heat
Leave a motherfucker up shit's creek
Popped by one of the P's, killed by one of the Souls
Murdered by one of the Folks and the Vice Lords
Talkin shit you better be ready to fight for
That's somethin might get shot twice for
Me and my garage is infamous
You don't wanna spark the emphasis
On a pistol I can make it pitch black in the room
You don't wanna bring darkness into this

[Chorus]
