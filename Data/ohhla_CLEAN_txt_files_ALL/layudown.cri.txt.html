Chorus (Dre B):

Baby, I've been thinkin' 'bout you lately
shit been drivin' me crazy
the first day I saw you I knew that I had to have you
baby, want you to be my lady
maybe I can make you famous
now that I got you in my room girl I'm putcha to bed

Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma fuck you girl

Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma fuck you girl

Verse 1 (Cristiles):

She ain't ready for me,
I can tell by the way that she playin' hard to get
but don't forget when you ready for me
I'ma have that thang wet and as ready as it can get
I'm one dance away from sayin' I'm in love with you
one glance away from sayin' I'ma cut with you
one chance away from sayin' I'ma fuck with you
so give me that chance girl whats up with you
she wanna drink, wanna smoke, wanna get high
shit fine, but my mind on them thick thighs
lets ride to the crib then come inside
girl you finna get yours if I get mine
I ain't rushin' you I'll let you feel comfortable
keep in mind the temperature is adjustable
I throw some music on, dim the lights some
she said "what you finna do?" when I sung

Chorus (Dre B):

Baby, I've been thinkin' 'bout you lately
shit been drivin' me crazy
the first day I saw you I knew that I had to have you
baby, want you to be my lady
maybe I can make you famous
now that I got you in my room girl I'm putcha to bed

Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed

Putcha to bed, I'ma fuck you girl

Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma fuck you girl

Verse 2 (Cristiles):

She undressin' slowly, with a smile
them eyes so seductive I get aroused
she pull me closer she said "want me"
fingertips on her thong pull it down slowly
she said "I want you" I said "show me"
so she climbed on top and put it on me
god damn, that shit so juicy
love the way she sayin' she my number one groupie
we should make a movie, love the way she do me
she said "fuck me chris, I want you to abuse me"
get on all fours then, doubt you could take it
kick them heels off girl I want you all naked
ass up, spank it, sound like she achin'
the way that she bussin' ain't a way to mistake it
way them legs shakin' I know she ain't fakin'
it's called fuckin', love ain't what we makin'

Chorus (Dre B):

Baby, I've been thinkin' 'bout you lately
shit been drivin' me crazy
the first day I saw you I knew that I had to have you
baby, want you to be my lady

now that I got you in my room girl I'm putcha to bed

Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma fuck you girl

Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma putcha to bed
Putcha to bed, I'ma fuck you girl

Verse 3 (Dre B):

Started with a hug, ended with a kiss
but I can't say I didn't expect this
it's drivin' me crazy
thought you were my lady
turned out to be a freak, now you in my sheets
ain't shit else to say so don't even speak
it's been about a week, since the last time I saw you
so drop them panties and I'ma drop my drawers too
it's gon' be on, all night long
she playin' Dre B 'cause she like my song
she say I fuck good, she say I fuck great
pussy hella juicy like a T-bone steak
I ain't gon' stop, I ain't gon' quit
I'ma give it to you baby just like this
now give me some head
and I'ma put you to bed, yeah

Chorus (Dre B):

Baby, I've been thinkin' 'bout you lately
