Talkin bout the system the police, homicide, D.A., F.B.I. all of them
Instead of putting it on all liquor stores in community
why don't you put it on lil little daycare joint right there.
Something you know? Peoples crazy man they ain't doin anything
but gettin out and gettin a damn gun and lay everyone down
and shooting everyone in the head two times two times two times
(*explosion*)

[Verse 1 - The Grouch]
Loose cannon bang
Loose cannon
Watch out
You never really know who's the next one to blow
Who's cannons loose who's plannin what
Who's not plannin standing on shaky ground and demanding
What you're not handing out
Last straw no fuse broken law
There's no joking cause it's all on the news now
Every channel talking on the piano
Couldn't figure out little Jonny had problems
But his daddy kept a house full of guns
But it only took one only took one
He held the power headed to the roof of the school
Didn't have to aim yelling bout he wasn't a fool
He made that change close range
Students yellin first time felon
Times fifty now isn't that nifty
Trace it back to rap tapes
Said he was wearing black a lot
He wanted to be an astronaut but he failed
He's headed to the moon though didn't want to see jail
barrel in the mouth with no doubts blown out skull
no bull Jonny had spool
Rule number one you can't spot him
If you think you got him then tell us about him(go on)
Tell us about him(go on)
Tell us about him(come on)
Tell us about him

[Chorus]
Cause he's a loose cannon
Why you acting like you really won't
We caught your ass on a bad day
Now let my mind spray this way that a way this way that a way
Loose cannon
Loose cannon(Sunspot Jonz)
Are you acting like you really should
Really should(Sunspot Jonz)
Though I thought it was all good
All good(Sunspot Jonz)
In the hood but you proved us wrong you proved us wrong

[Verse 2 - Sunspot Jonz]
Loose canon
My whole life was a street fight under broken street lights
You could never live up to the street hype
Everybody thinks they know the streets right
Loose Canon
So broken dreams is a common
Street site
Ramen for dinner again tonight
Probably want to steal something tonight when I see people living right
No right to breathe in this seran wraped reality
Tight situations mixed with adolescent attitude
Always have me in the mood to be rude
Like Grouch fuck the dumb son
Don't talk to me see
Cause nothing changes among those who see
Fun outta see me swerve
Gottcha like a germ on a slide
Microcope
Feeling outta place like the per or the man like the pope
Build up the rush like dope
But I know they stressing like a iscetope
Chemicle elements got me off the deep end i'm a loose canon peeping
Blind when i'm not speaking in the back of the room
Stealing my mamas purse so I learned the hard way cursed
To take it the wrong way first
Dramah unrehearsed, but it's always the same old thing till the first
Dramah unrehearsed, but it's always the same old shit till the first
Loose canon loose canon

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
