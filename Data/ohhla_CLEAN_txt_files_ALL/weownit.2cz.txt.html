[Intro]
It's Young Khalifa man
(2 CHAINZ!)

[2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, we gettin paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed (BOW)
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed (Tru)
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, YEAH!

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now I'm

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
One, shot, everything rides on 
to-night, even if I've got 
three, strikes, I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And, I'm, not to be played with
Be-cause, it can get dangerous
See, these, people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, and the same ones that I ride with be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with; if you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with my new broad, thats a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with - ain't {NO WAY AROUND IT}
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin for my dogs, do this everyday
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin sure we ball
Like the mob all you do is call; catch you if you fall - Young Khalifa

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[2 Chainz]
I ride or die for mine...
I ride or die for love; hear we go...

This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin like a killer inside - OHH~!
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin off set
I look better on your girl THAN HER OUTFIT..

[Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up
Never ran; we the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some 
one thing about it; got a problem
I got the same one; money rolls, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed, follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

[Chorus]

[Outro: 2 Chainz] + (Wiz Khalifa)
I ride or die for mine...
I ride or die for love...
Yeah (hahahahahah.. uhh)
(This moment, we own it)
I ride for die for mine
I'm ride or die material
One life to live so here he go
(This moment, we own it)</pre>
