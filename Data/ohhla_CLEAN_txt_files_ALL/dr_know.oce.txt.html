It's Wildlife all day everyday
Check the resum√©
From NYC
Reppin the 5 burroughs
Check my style ( ? ) (mister)
Won't change my attitude
Wherever I touch down be homebase for Mush
Nigga
Every two years I pull out the lot with a brand new whip like what
Say somethin now, stupid
Think of violatin me? 
(You gotta deal with my GD niggas)
Yeah, hop on the walkie
Notify my mans that it's about to get so for real
Dog, your looks don't kill
You wanna eat my food, my plate's right here
(Eat it up, nigga)
Yeah, justify your means with the ends
But make sure I'm never comin back
How 'bout that
Mush
I
Must I show you properly how thee should die?
Huh?
Drastic measures
(Yo, that's my pleasure)
My mindstate's with whatever that's fittin the mood
Here's a warnin for y'all
I 
Yeah 
What's that?
Huh?
What?
Calm yourself
Don't get beside yourself
Who?
They not ready
Cut the nonsense
Dead that
Must I show you properly
Yeah, I said that
Wound you receive, I bled that
Like the seven and a half moon crescent I'm exact
Actual fact, right and exact
Dr. Know
Yeah
Mush
To floss or not to floss is the question
Hehe
By any means
Me and my mans gon' shine
Burn bright till the lights go dim
Aiyo, ask me again
Better yet, I'ma tell it just so ya understand, hops
Watch, plot
Get the larceny out your heart
Cause what you start I'ma finsih with a .44
Dispose of the shells in the sewer
As I maneouvre the 4.6 cross town
All black
(Wheels chrome)
Windows tinted
Shit look pretty in the night time
Baseball cap low, low profile move
(Fuck out the way) when I come through
Raise up
It's my way or the highway
Slip somethin in your drink to make your pupils dilate
Here's a warnin for y'all
I 
Yeah 
What's that?
Huh?
What?
Calm yourself
Don't get beside yourself
Who?
They not ready
Cut the nonsense
Dead that
Yo, your paper's no match for mines
(Tally up mufuckas)
Whether corrupt or legal
My sinister mindstate be like Dr. No
How would you know
The IQ's above the norm of the average thug, y'all
(I'm bigger than drugs, nigga)
I be quick to sacrifice my wife and kids
Like the devil himself
(Sosa)
No lie
O keep the learjet on standby
Stocked up with nuff licks and nuff lye
Damn if you do
(Come test Sir Fly, I)
Can't even imagine that in my mind's eye
100% deep inside your area
Wherever I go I roll
Protected like the pope minus the hat and the cloth
(Don't)
Just leave it alone
Fuckin with us is suicide
(W)-i-(l)-d-life
We ride on
Here's a warnin for y'all
I 
Yeah 
What's that?
Huh?
What?
Calm yourself
Don't get beside yourself
Who?
They not ready
Cut the nonsense
Dead that
Must I show you properly
Yeah, I said that
Wound you receive, I bled that
Like the seven and a half moon crescent I'm exact
Actual fact, right and exact
Dr. Know</pre>
