Twinkle jiggle make it clap
Get on the floor put a hump in that back
I see you K.D
Yeah, SR, Slow V, Retro
Make that money
Girl work for the tip x2

[Verse 1: Slow V]
Yo, Ladies love me girls adore me
I mean even the ones who never saw me
Like, the way that I tip at the show
The reason why girl I got dough, for show
Tonight, it takes two drinks to get you hype
It takes two more to get you to bite
It takes two dances maybe two chances
To get you to leave with me tonight
Se they trash them, but I ask them
Call me Mickey D's I know how to Mac them
Take two buns spread them
It's like magic, I simply razzle and dazzle them
See you shaking that got the boys louder
I don't make it rain I give presidential showers
Not scared get my thoughts collected
Not Ross triple C's cool, calm, collective

[Chorus]
Twinkle jiggle make it clap
Get on the floor put a hump in that back
Work, work them thighs you got to survive
Don't nobody have a problem with your 9 to 5
Oh there goes another 20 again
Oh there goes another 50 again
Oh there goes another hundred again
There's some balling ass niggas in the club tonight so get naked

[Hook]
We don't make it rain girl we make it poor x3
What's wrong never seen the club flooded before?

[Verse 2: Retrospect]
Now, now, now, now
I'm from that gold in the mouth
Knee high socks where the hot spots
Make you want to drop till you pop lock
Make a nigga hot for the knock till it stop, stop
DJ in the spot makes it wicky wicky wah
Up and down, don't be scared
Get on the pole it's time to get yours
It's all about the cash flow
Don't worry about your man slow
Who brings the cash home?
Shake that ass hoe
Oops my bad didn't mean to say hoe
This one goes out to the freaks in the grove
Reach to the floor make your teeth touch your toes
Put your knees to your nose and your flexible
Showgirls, Golden Finger, Club Madonna, Pussycat
I been around the world seen a lot of sisters
But they aint got shit on a Miami Stripper like

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Retrospect &amp; Slow V]
R  Now you got one kid, baby daddy ain't shit
Plans to get rich girl work for the tip
S  Got to know how to dip steady rock your hips
Believe me I'm a do more than make you drip
R  You feel like a misfit girlfriends dissing
How you going to pay for your college tuition
S  You've got intuition, listen mammy you see
That's not water drizzling
R  No pot to piss in
Keep on living that stripper life get your money right
S  If you can dance all night I can tip all night
Tonight girl, I'm a get your ass spoiled right
R   Wrong, cause you can't do it forever
But get that cheddar, SR Feeling
S   But come over here cause we tip you better
El ninos that can change you weather

[Chorus]
