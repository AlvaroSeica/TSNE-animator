Ooh you turn me on,so boy don't lye
I will never show you (?) so don't try

And all I'm sayin to you is dont be cruel

[Chorus-Missy]
Yo baby pop, yea you, come and give me a kiss
Betta make it fast, or else I'm gonna get pissed
Don't you hear the music pumpin' hard, like I wish you would
Now push it (awww), push it, push it real good

[Monica]
Don't get me wrong, that's just me
I just want you to be all you can be like in the army
Don't try to play me boy cuz I'm nobody's fool
And all I'm sayin' to you is don't be cruel

[Chorus]
