[Hook]
And we've got soul!
Maybe not as much as the late James Brown
But enough to shake up a frown
Soul! More than my shoes
A pep in our step when we're walking on
It's got soul! Beyond our control
Through these songs, the way that we role

"Soul, so much soul" {*Scratched by DJ Bonez*}

Huh, c'mon now, huh

[Verse 1]
The way that they love that is the way that we love this
Chips out of my soul every time I did dumb shit
We've all been that young kid with too much time
And energy to run with, drums stick in sync with our soul
I'm a lost one when there's no mic to hold
From a minor goal - to a major role
Addicted to the unlimited, infinite size of the soul
It's that rush, adrenaline blood pump
Catch a buzz and get it to someone
Can't match that drug, affecting the lungs
Once I rap for the love, you getting a lump sum

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Huh, forever endeavour to get your soul searching
That extra little treasure when you find your soul purpose
Since I first heard it, now I observe and word it
A lot of set backs but kept at it, and kept working
Determined to follow through
Fell into that trap of tomorrow will do
My brain became a hollow tube
Swallowed fumes, few knew I sold small portions
I'm back to rap, release these endorphins
Amateurs ignoring the kings that came before em
Very technical but technically very boring
Rainfall walking, solo missionary enforcement
That kept me stalking these beats

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And their doubts just amount to proving em wrong
On all accounts, found my soul choosing songs
Put a bounce in em now, it's about moving along
These sounds, no bounds, do what we want
We've come a long way to roll the dice
And kept it cool, never soul on ice
This is a Mogwai, multiply, add flow poltergeist
Strolling by your snow screen, old soul modernised
Along the lines of it really ain't a long life
A strong supply of falling from the wrong side
Floating up steams through Warrandyte
In tune with the metronome yet to know on time
Never stole the rights to my life force
It feels kind of good, think that we might be on the right course
