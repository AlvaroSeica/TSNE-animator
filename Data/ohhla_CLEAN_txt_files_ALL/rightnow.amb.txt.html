[Chorus - 2X]
Right now - Sometimes the sun hits my Hatchet charm
It lights up my car, like a disco bar
Right now

[Otis]
I'm cool
Layin' back in the cut like what
Just feelin' so true
Who knew that we'd be right where we're supposed to be -
With the family?
And I know I can be calm
But the truth is, it's all good
Cause I got my Karma on high
Homie we shine just like you knew I would
I've flown
Doin' my show and the family love goes straight to my brain
And I'm hopin' it'll never change
You can put that on my Hatchet chain
What I'm tryin' to do is describe
All the feeling that I have inside
Cause right now everything's so right
Baby, so so right as we ride through the night

[Chorus - 2X]
Right now - Sometimes the sun hits my Hatchet charm
It lights up my car, like a disco bar
Right now

[Bonez Dubb]
Right now I'm just maxin' in the studio
Makin' sounds with my heart and they soothe my soul
Rollin' deep with my boys smokin' on the indo
18 inch Hatchetman on the back window
Representin' with pride, you can't stop my shine
In complete darkness, I can see just fine
Can't explain how fresh I feel
And hope it don't stop
Even better that we're workin' all the way to the top
Right now I'm gettin' loud
Takin' care of the crowd right
Not a cloud in the sky so the stars shine bright
Livin' it up with the family, this ain't no dream
But sometimes that the way it seems, know what I mean?
I'm sayin' this: Remember the days of hate, like how -
You gonna talk your shit, bitch? Look at me now
My lights are never gonna die or even fade
Cause now I'm on the other side of the barricade!

[Chorus - 2X]
Right now - Sometimes the sun hits my Hatchet charm
It lights up my car, like a disco bar
Right now

[Hook - 2X]

Everybody hands up! Touch the sky!
Everybody hands up! Touch the sky!
Everybody hands up! Touch the sky!
And it's Psychopathic til we die!

[Chorus - 2X]
Right now - Sometimes the sun hits my Hatchet charm
It lights up my car, like a disco bar
Right now</pre>
