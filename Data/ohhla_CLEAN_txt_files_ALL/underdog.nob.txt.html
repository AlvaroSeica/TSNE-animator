[Chorus: Young Noble](X2)
The big homie told me one thing and it went like this
Get off your ass if you plan to be rich
And this the year of the underdog
feel it in the air
Yeah, I can feel it in the air

[Verse 1: Young Noble]
In the town in that coupe
That youngling on a stoop
Soaked up the game
Epitome of the truth
I lead by example and do what
I'm supposed to
Count on me to always come through when the pressure's on
Make no weapon form against them outlaws
We soldiers of God, against all odds
This the year of the underdog
Still I rise, I told you niggas
I will evolve
And there's something more bigger
Something more powerful
More independent now
They gonna pay me by the minute now
Not just my blood
My soul invested in this thing
Failure's never been an option
Get your paper, my nigga, we eating lobster
Young Noble and Gage Gully
Year of the underdog, real niggas ride with me

[Chorus: Young Noble](X2)
The big homie told me one thing and it went like this
Get off your ass if you plan to be rich
And this the year of the underdog
feel it in the air
Yeah, I can feel it in the air

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
It's the year of the underdog
I'm rocking gym shorts and jays in this rap game
'Cause I come to ball
Allergic to sleeping
Niggas serving and scheming
Yeah, I wonder y'all
A sketchy nigga because my gun a draw
Where I'm from little kids be shooting since laser tag
By the time they 20 they martyrs or someone's baby's dad
Cops wanna kill me 'cause I'm darker than a paper bag
Parked the latest Jag by the police sergeant and made him mad
Who cares what my enemies think?
Long as I'm grinding till I'm literally bricks
Till Bernini is giving me Meeks
I'm hustling all night
On so much caffeine I'm literally pissing out energy drinks
And cruel love ain't a small thing
That's why I'm on that hokey team shit
Grinding till we all kings
And them hating niggas have the mean muggers
By screw facing our magazine covers
We on, nigga

[Chorus: Young Noble](X2)
The big homie told me one thing and it went like this
Get off your ass if you plan to be rich
And this the year of the underdog
feel it in the air
Yeah, I can feel it in the air

[Verse 3: Gage Gully]
I don't sit in the house, projects
We be getting them out
I'm state to state
Cross country when they living in doubt
Can't be afraid to travel
I'm a warrior, made to battle
I'll take the stage
Tear that motherfucker down 'cause I have you
I'm popular with the dealers
I probably could get you realer
Or possible order still
But tell your people we'll bill you
Want it now, cash out
In the streets back routes
My movement that bow
More traffic than a crack house
More action over here
Getting dough so that counts
Getting drown, hustling days of the weak then pass out
When they was trying to freestyle
All I had was wee pows
I'm on the concrete blocks, and Gully a beast now
It's cold, I'm leaning for no reason, looking to bleed towns
Soon as they catch on we taking the cream then bounce
My team found oh so much to leave you barely seeing how
Walking to queen mount, Gully, he chip a bean dream out

[Chorus: Young Noble](X2)
The big homie told me one thing and it went like this
Get off your ass if you plan to be rich
And this the year of the underdog
feel it in the air
Yeah, I can feel it in the air</pre>
