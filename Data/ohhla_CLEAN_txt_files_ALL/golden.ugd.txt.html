[U-God]
I keep my third eye 20/20, everything looking sunny
Gods told me, nothing move but the money money
Head strong, backbone, hit 'em on the Bat phone
Good to be back home, feeling like fresh chrome
Something for your headphone, build the establishment
Quit while you're ahead, save the embarrassment
Elect me for president, thought I was irrelevant
Battled all the elements, overcome the hard ships
And struggled with accountants, shit got Rocky
I trained in the mountains, now the world is mine
Got it spraying from the fountains, drive by the housing
Reminiscence, take a piss, staircase, we made thousands
We was Park Hill, rug rats, fishermen, thug hats
Five dollar snap-backs, never got no love back
That's why I sold packs, damn right, I stole that
Blamp you, hold that, now I want the whole stack
Change my life, now it's rap, ain't no turning back

[Chorus: Raekwon &amp; Ghostace Killah sample]
Tell, tell Golden Arms maintain the the fort
Tell, tell Golden Arms maintain the the fort
Tell, tell Golden Arms maintain the the fort
Tell, tell Golden Arms maintain the the fort

[U-God]
I'm on a mission, bred from the poorest conditions
Baby fed from the pots from the poorest of kitchens
Got bread in the streets, from the rawest addiction
Made an 180 turn, with the lords conviction
It's the ride and friction, keep the iron on my side
To avoid the friction, in this modern day slavery
I survived the lynching, with no rap pitching
The price of living is too high, two jobs working
This nigga is too tired, no more babies
She needs them tubes tied, word on the tweets
I heard he's a new guy, heard he was too fly
Damn every week she getting scooped by a new ride
The ghetto's up in flames, think you should calm down
My insides is evil, you in the wrong town
Whatever you want, you better watch yourself
Whatever you want, you better watch yourself

[Chorus]</pre>
