[D-Shot talking]
Aw shit (*Coughing*)
That blunt ain't nuttin' nice man
Peep game though
Yeah (*Coughing*)
Shit

[Verse 1 - D-Shot]
One mo' spot
For the nigga named Shot
With the D in the front
Time to give 'em what they want
Hoes wanna affiliate they self with the shot caller
Cause they know I'm a baller
I'm representin' nathan but the V
Click shit, E-40 and B
Legit, now we might clip some shit
And to you tramp ass hoes it goes something like this
You can call me on the under
But you can never meet Shot on that alias number
The hoes ball down to my SC 4 double 0
But what they don't know

[Hook]
A motherfuckin' thang about D-Shot
Cause he's got way mo' knots than a d-spot
A boss baller comin' out the V
The D to the S to the H-O-T
Who knows a motherfuckin' thang about D-Shot
Cause he's got way mo' knots than a d-spot
A boss baller comin' out the V
The D to the S to the H-O-T

[Verse 2 - D-Shot]
I break niggas like bitches in a game of craps
No screws on my cruise but a gang of straps
It ain't my fault, I ain't trippin' like I try to tell hoes
At the club on my knock it's them Streisdale hoes
Six-footer on the scale she's a 1-6-0
Big shot from the block fixin' to knock this ho
At the club way perved on some shit E hooked
Me and V was choppin' game about this bitch I shook
Chased her through the town like a young greyhound
Shot caller gettin' ghost bitch I'm out this town
Hurricane in my system makes my Lexus run
You can call me on the under bitch but you gets none

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - D-Shot]
Now let you tellit D-Shot is a big fella
A Click fella, at 2-6-0 I'm a thick fella
And my side hogs and my dogs know the rest
When funk was on I wore a triple X vest
In the drought season I went rock for rock
I guess that's why they say I knock harder than a d-spot
And hoes ooh I'm on them sluts and tramps
You can ride on my trunk just don't blow up my amps
But never shotgun Shot don't have one to fit a gender
Six-foot breakin' she's a bender
Tryin' to chase the coupe as I smob through the V
Punk ass ho you don't know a thing about me
