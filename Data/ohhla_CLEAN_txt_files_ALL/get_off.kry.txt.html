Typed by: Cno Evil

[Kryme Life]
When you hear a banger, better stand up, nigga it's official
When it's coming for me, it's Kryme Life on the M.I.
You gonna get your hands up, nigga, on the corner
When we rocking them shows, it's to ya nose with the semi
Had to get my grams up, had to play it tough
Manuever it down to Kansas, where the fans lust
Them pound cakes and snuff, get 'em off as dubs
The brown ace we tuck, hand 'em off at clubs
See a nigga down, right on his wallet, open you up a new account
With the silver dollar, making a profit
It was greasy in the projects, then I started scheeming in the process
This life, it wasn't easy on my wallet
A wiseman schooled me to the value of a dollar
And I manifest in myself, I ain't get no help
I just invest in myself, nobody else writing these records, just myself

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
This is for all my hustlers, stuck on the grind
Broke niggas now pay, niggas stay with the time
Drew blood for they strip, ride with a clip
Crying inside, know when niggas die for this shit
Can't be nothing else but raw, cuz every time
I pick up a microphone, nigga ask for more
Spit something that'll make a nigga crack a jaw
Sip something, blaze something and pack the floor

[Kryme Life]
You see me? It ain't a secret, my niggas is beasting
You can't hold us back no more, too much shit leaking, pa
About my business, I'm not for the games
You can get beat senseless, and shot from a range
For trying to stop my change, and what I got to claim
But this I can't miss, I still got my aim
Don't get it confused, I ain't trying to knock your fame
But all that popularity gon' get your ass laying
Show niggas what time it is when the glocks get clean
One minute I'm out on Benz, where them pots get steamed
All my hungry hood niggas, hit the block get cream
Duck police, show no teeth, we look mean
Put your game face on, we out to get green
In the same place where Deck and Rae made C.R.E.A.M.
Two twelve, two eighteen, tuck the eight scheme
On the grind, cell phones, got custom made rings

[Chorus]

[Kryme Life]
Uh, the Kryme Life, ain't nothing nice, but I live it, kid
I can move the rocky, but stuck in my pivot
Passed addition, no look, I magic hands
The way I make my dough stretch, call me Plasticman
It's no threats, kid, the gat's blam, up early in the morning
Leave you stuck like the traffic jam
Ain't nothing moving but the money and the master plan
And ya'll dudes don't it, believe me, no snooze on it
Your face'll get ate, like a plate with food on it
While I stand there, holding a square, like 'who want it?'
T.M.F., C.G.'s, Ruffline
0-6, more chips, niggas bout to have rough time
T.M.F., C.G.'s, Ruffline
0-6, more chips, niggas bout to have rough time
We hustlin', hustlin', nigga, get that work off
Get that money up, yes sir

[Chorus]</pre>
