Verse 1:

While the blind will follow the foolish advocates
Rhyming usage accurate
Surviving on faith, and ramen noodle packages
June hazardous, fuck a pacifist
Still sleeping on my heat like 9s under the mattressess
I'm stuck with the savages, I'm where the grim await
They hijacking on the interstate
I'm trying to see the women with the thicker shape
I could penetrate
Innovate to fill my dinner plate with rib and steak
Pad, pen and tape, playing on a dirty crate
Some survived some met with an early fate
By the time I'm 38
If i havent reached the pearly gates
Then my sound will still circulate
At an urgent rate
Too shook to breeze by
Fronting like goons and crooks emcees why
Marxman raised in brooklyn knee high
With apocalyptic flow book of Eli

Hook X2:

Script full of sickening rage, had the lyrics displayed
Encrypted on page
Learn tricks of the trade
We living in a miserable age, dont want to sit in a cage
Exist in a daze
Learn tricks of the trade
Remain vigilant of slithering snakes they move with liquor
And haze the wickedest ways
Learn tricks of the trade
Sick with the plague, fuck minimum wage, thats why they swift
With the blade, equipped with a gauge
Tricks of the trade

Verse 2:

June Marx
Cold as ice, nothing feeble
Lethal as a cobra strike none equal
Infrared scopes at night,lust and evil
Clutch the eagle, so precise crush cerebral
Stuff the dutch with diesel, actors wont live
To make another fucking sequel, knuckle up your see-through
Struck like under siege 2, sentry caught injury
Ready all infantry, heavy artillery
Every bar vividly, metaphor or similie
Similar to templar symmetry
In renaissance italy, I set it off instantly
Lets get it on, in the present form
You'll be dead and gone bitterly
Decepticon wickedly struck your fam missing
Disrupt the transmission of corrupted ambition
Uncle Sam's system, words flourish in better placement
Justice understanding nourishing elevation

Hook X2 

Verse 3:

Backslap a lame, blast the flame, judas looking for rap fame
Sniff him out like k9 units up on the path train
Acid rain tarnished skies, I'm unauthorized
Disarm the spies, before the riot squad arrives
Marx will ride like a heartless savage
Till I dissolve to gasses, nothing left but fog and ashes
Across the atlas, bastards heard of me
An animal currently earning international currency
Understandable perfectly
You laughable herbs to  me
I suggest you warn your admiral urgently
The bandits will circle me, like a saloon fight
I damage your circuitry, and move in moonlight
Womb to the tomb like, whatever june write
Rescucitate it, give the culture new life
The rude type, with the merciless intentions
Words serve as weapons I return with a vengeance
