[Intro: 60 Second Assassin (Killah Priest)]
Doomsday! Doomsday!
Doomsday! (Must obey)
Doomsday! (Mondays, Tuesdays, Doomsday)
Doomsday! (Okay)

[Killah Priest]
Yo near the circumference of the angel, blew the last trumpet
I see the mass run for cover as the rich run for cover
Waving guns at eachother, the sons smother their mothers
Ultimate slaughter against the daughters
I see them begging in the streets, record us
As horror covers their aura
Some men run around trying to read the Torah
Space to spaceship predicted lower than the solar eclipse
The prophets stand in the midst of the seven candlesticks
Scientists they couldn't even handle it
As they turn into alcoholics, some couldn't even call it
Looking at something prehistoric up in the orbit
Coming down like a boric, as six into telepathic
Madness amongst the masses and poisonous gasses
It is doomsday!

[60 Second Assassin]
Doomsday! Doomsday!
Torn emperor, sent to all rap repentence
Get chopped on the mic looking to catch ya death
Boom bash! Come the sand from the minute glass

[C-Rayz Walz]
You and I dwell in the land with nice Gods and death angel squad
Now many souls ask "Why" so now rely
His kingdom come and his world'll be done
But the Earth is given in to hands of scum
And many shall run to and fro through the Earth
Looking for a spiritual rebirth from America's curse
My scientists research and rehearse, a demonic verse
A psychology, a tricknowlogy, there's a thirty-three
of free masonry, facing me on the streets of the N.Y.C.
Implemented by the arms of the N.Y.P.D.
So now as I stare off the plateau known as the ghetto
I grab my rifle as a momento
I new world order, steps up the temple
As black America fights for our survival, I wait for a black arrival
The Christ who is found in a bible
As I read Revelations chapter seventeen
I find out America is no longer a dream but a nightmare
So beware, many niggaz fall before unaware
As we pressure towards the Armageddon
and King Arthur's plan is implemented
We fight a hoard to make wars
Even the desert swarms still trying to lay laws and heal nuclear sores
As we hear the missles last roar, trapped in a basement score hiding
from a new law
That looks like law, that sounds like law but is it law?
As we hear the marching of federal emergency
management agency's feet coming from the rubber street
As a black helicopter streaks above we shoved deeper into the darkness
of the basement
Where we heard a statement, no weapon form shall prosper
No M16 or rocket launcher or Apache chopper or black helicopter
Mig jet, sharpnels, grenades or hollow tips
A flashlight flicks in the darkness, he said
"Neither hollows shall fly, bullets or lead"
As we fled across a backyard waiting for a black God
Who was barred and persecuted while my nation was polluted and prostituted
Now they tried to refute it and pretend they were not the men
Who live off the legacy or hatred and sin
The same men who enslaved me, raped me and reshaped me
Plus my brothers and sisters that hate me
We're on urban streets while they sit in congress seats
While black America weaps and mourns
The U.S. Government spawns
While the American Indian is torn by evil spores and unjust laws
More diplomat flaws...

[60 Second Assassin]
Prepare for doomsday, I behold the power of Gigantor
Ripping rhymes to pieces like Skeletor
My metaphors circulate like corridors
Beyond all horrorcore, this beats haul off the holy call
Wise words drop like Niagara Falls
In and out of seasons, summer to the falls
Raining, stuttering, forty days and forty nights
Meteorologists don't pick up from the satellites
Another boom bash! Come the sand from the minute glass
Another session get smashed, posses, ya crew gangbanged ya ass fast
Back to reload, run back to burning sands
More than enough jewels to whip a bumrush
Make sure ya robe's tough and I'ma run ya regiment like General Monk Monk
Two thous' two hundred miles, do the vowels
Beyold the air waves and clouds
I see wicked witches on broomsticks pimping
Our everyday black wizzes turn Christian
Free without freedom, justice and equality
Symptons of everyday victims like easy pickings
Falling from the tree of great wisdom
60 Sec. always uses sharp precision</pre>
