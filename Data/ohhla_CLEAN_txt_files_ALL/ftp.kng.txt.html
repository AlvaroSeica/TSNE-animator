[Intro: Timbo King]
Yeah yeah yeah... yo...
We shoot the police like...
Kill the feds like...
Yeah snipers gon' snipe 'em
Pop the mayor like...
Yeah yeah... hit the president up like...
Stab preachers in his chest like...
Straight from the hood book, the hood book
What y'all got? What you got?
Bloody city, bloody city, father forgive
Pressure poor, y'all wanna pressure poor right?
Uproar, uproar, vote! (Fort Knox)
Yeah, it's on, let's go!
Yo yo...

[Timbo King]
CO's catchin' buck fifties right in their dome
On some Larry Davis shoot 'em up, bang on po-po
The spooks that sat by the door with SK's
Runnin' up in city hall...
Bloomberg, where that money for the ghettoes at?
More parks plus schools, let's get to the facts
Settle the facts, got guns from Habib that'll blow up buildings
And our mission ain't complete 'til we save all the children
Tonto, yeah Indian spear
In the end we could end ya career
Black Market, 56, freedom or death
School of the gifted, the only one's left is loadin' the techs
The womb been entombed with the Sun and the moon
Pops drunk Jack Daniel's as he sat in the room
Black love Curtis May made a future shop
Lick shots, two shots, lick shots...

[Young Brooklyn]
Yo yo yo...
Where I come from niggaz bust dum-dums
Out of automatics that'll dead all ya static
Extra clip for that extra havoc
Hot steel burnin' like hot acid
I'm done playin'
As soon as I see the target my gun's sprayin'
Niggaz asses is lame so I blast 'em with flames
Tryin' to master this thing, I'm countin' cash in this game
Boy, I interrupt ya session
Tell them silly niggaz, stop guessin'
And Big Willie niggaz start bettin'
We hold weight like sumo wrestlers
So when we come through, who gon' test us?
Lick shots from cocked berettas
At anybody tryin' to stop the chedder
Boy, I catch you at 9:45
Then I hit you with the nine and the .45
Niggaz is 7:30
Bustin' off my gun like James Worthy
Nigga, aiyo I stay dirty
Aiyo my team too real, stay far from the lames
Only fuck with dime bitches that be lovin' the brain
I keep it cool like the ice on my chain
Yeah, I keep it cool like the ice on my chain
Yo, cuz when I pop off niggaz get knocked off
My shit is hot in The Source
Tell the coroners to get the white floss
They can't describe the way their body's a corpse
I'm a thug from the lost and found
I smoke a twenty that I lost, I found
So watch ya mouth when the boss around
Niggaz gettin' lost and found
Cash is a must, I'm addin' it up
Pass me a Dutch, we rollin' on twenties
So the Spreewell spinnin' and it's only the beginnin'

[Outro: Timbo King]
Yeah yeah yeah... yo...
We shoot the police like...
Kill the feds like...
Pops the mayors like...
Hit the president up like...
Stab Tony Blair in his chest like...
Straight from the hood book...
Bo King, Young Brook, 56, 56...</pre>
