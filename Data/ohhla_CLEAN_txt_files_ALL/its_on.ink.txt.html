Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
When I'm on, it's on bitch
When I'm on, it's on bitch
When I'm on, it's on bitch
When I'm on, it's on

[Verse 1]
First off, ya'll ain't on this shit that I'm on
Eyes like I was made in Taiwan
Aces you could say what you want
Just blow me, I'm a ticking time bomb, boom
Might pull up in the car show
Niggas ain't gotta gas me like Arco
Riding through the city with a hood full of Broncos
Out just looking for the money like Waldo
I just wanna ball, Rondo
Make it rain in this bitch, get a poncho
Roll up blunt thicker than a high loaf
Take one hit, might turn into a combo
Got one eye open like a raider
Better cuff your chick, I take her
Say I gotta turn like skater shoes
And lay the pipe like 80 do

[Chorus]
Ya'll ain't on this shit that I'm on
Ya-Ya'll ain't on this shit that I'm on
Ya'll ain't on this shit that I'm on
Ya-Ya'll ain't on this shit that I'm on

[Verse 2]
Ok, money in my mind, put it in my hair
Eyes look like I was made in Japan
Fresh, ya'll niggas was made in a can
So fly, you can see when I land
Movie in the making, Hi my name is
2 in the air, call it double dating
Jahlil on the beat, I'm a troublemaker
Going through paper, staplers
One foot in tatted like a sailor
Trying to find a bad bitch, Naughty by Nature
Sorry baby, these ain't out yet
Gotta go back to the future for my outfit
Bitch I'm gone, see me from a distance
High off life, fuck a intervention
Ahh, burn slow like incenses
Head up, chest out like imprints

[Chorus]
Ya'll ain't on this shit that I'm on
Ya-Ya'll ain't on this shit that I'm on
Ya'll ain't on this shit that I'm on
Ya-Ya'll ain't on this shit that I'm on

[Outro]
When I'm on, it's on bitch
When I'm on, it's on bitch
When I'm on, it's on bitch
When I'm on, it's on</pre>
