[Intro: Yelawolf]
Man this fuckin bitch, gone and took off
Fuckin with some, college graduate
Punk ass, Abercrombie wearin motherfucker
Left me broken-hearted in the Chevy
It's all good though, know why?
I got me bitch!

[Yelawolf]
Both of us was in the same class, in '02 in Antioch, Nashville
I, wanted you so bad that I forgot to mind my manners
Everybody wanted them panties, every guy was hopin to land it
We, would flirt around and touch hands until, we fucked around and took Xanax
And that's when you begin to drive me bananas
I, was in denial it's apparent you, began to lie to yo' parents
You should know that I can't live without you holdin my name
Now my heart's in control of my brain, and I can't hold it in the lanes

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
Rollin down 20 mayne
With this Jack in my cup, feelin down on my luck
And I'm doin 120 mayne
Maybe I'm givin up, baby I'm givin up
Baby what is happening?
Don't you believe in us? Don't you believe in us?
She said "I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough, love is not enough, love is not enough"

[Yelawolf]
Used to fuck so much we missed school, you was there when I needed you
I, was there when you needed me, we were unseparable
When I, was broke with no fuckin food, you was tough enough to be cool
Skate, holes all in my shoes, dope boys had me confused
I was in love with hip-hop, you was in love with that too
What made it come to a stop, had to have been the money issue
Biiitch, and I really miss the rain
I gave you all of my soul and I got left is a keychain

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
Who the fuck are you fuckin now? Bet he's always takin you out
College educated and proud, me, well I'm just a dropout
Can't, really blame you for buggin; ain't, I the dirt on your rug and
just the place to wipe, your shoes and give me all your throwaway lovin?
Back, to my buzzin and druggin, back, to my gutter with nothin
Back, to the rut all the sudden, cracks in the covenant, trustin me
You ain't gotta worry 'bout sharin this success with Wayne
Now it's just petty change, but I still feel the pain

[Chorus]</pre>
