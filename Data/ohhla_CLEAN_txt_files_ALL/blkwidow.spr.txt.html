INTRO

She's the poster girl
For facists and sadomasochists
Or anybody looking for an ass to kiss
She controls your world
And snatches your ego at the wrist 

VERSE 1

I had a run-in with a beautiful miss
She had the fattest onion
And a set of super-full lips
Never imagined someone cuter than this
My heart track was pumpin fast
Chewin my nails to the cuticle tips
And it's too late, Naw!
In fact, it's practically three late
To fathom e-scape
She had me had at (whistle) Hey!
And these days, I don't even practice a faith
But I'm still back on my knees, babe
And that's where I'll stay for my

CHORUS

Black Widow
Oh, there is no substitute or other honey I dig, no!
Black Widow
Ipso facto that nobody is this cold
Black Widow
See, it might be the way that she abuses me nightly
Black Widow
She's the Ice Queen, it probably isn't true that she likes me

Then I'm a miserable fool

Black Widow
Ipso facto that nobody is this cold
Black Widow
See, it might be the way that she abuses me nightly
Black Widow
She's the Ice Queen, it probably isn't true that she likes me 

VERSE 3

I send her flowers, she refuses to notice me
And spend my hours trying to write her beautiful poetry
I tend to shower gifts and affection in the widow's direction
She only sees me as a food that she hopes to eat
Totally raw, like when you go to the store and buy sushi
It's cool beans, I know what I'm for
And I could never grow to be more
Cuz in the scope of her thoughts
I'm supposed to be walked on, as though I'm the floor 
Come on!

OUTRO

She kiss so cool
Sweetness so cruel
Meanness so kind
Please miss all mine 

She kiss so cool
Sweetness so cruel
Meanness so kind
Please miss all mine</pre>
