[Chorus: Ludacris] + (Gucci Mane) + {woman}
P-p-p-party, I'ma party 'til I just can't party no mo'
(Party, I'ma party 'til I just can't party no mo')
Party, I'ma party 'til I just can't party no mo'
(Party, I'ma party 'til I just can't party no mo')
{Let's take a shot} take a shot {take a shot} take a shot
{Let's take a shot} take a shot {take a shot} take a shot, AYYY!
Party, I'ma party 'til I just can't party no mo'
(Party, I'ma party 'til I just can't party no mo')

[Ludacris]
I done had about fo' five six shots, yeah I'm gettin wasted
Red pills, blue pills, yeah I'm in +The Matrix+
Two swisha, three swisha, fo' swisha, five
So turn my music up and tell these hoes to get live
Got a pocket full of hundreds and some bottles on ice ice
Conjure and lime got a nigga feelin nice nice
Desert on my hip so if you gamble roll the dice
When I let it off once it make a nigga think twice twice
You got mo' dough then homie you gon' have to show me
You +Never+ say +It Rains+ like Tony! Toni! Ton√©!
My Chevy's outside and it's sittin on Kobe's
And I keep the hood with me like Obi-Wan Kenobi
Woodgrain trim, seats softer than your butt butt
Make your car rattle from the speakers in my trunk trunk
Swishas burnin slow and they got a nigga stuck stuck
But don't be a fool cause the tool's on tuck tuck

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Tell that slow bitch to bring another round, we gon' party 'til the sun's up
Ladies rub your titties and my gangstas put your guns up
Money money money, if you got it throw your ones up
And if they ain't got it tell 'em "SHUT UP, YA DUMB FUCK!"
My money stays in hand, you could say I got a grip grip
Out to scoop my chips, you could say I gotta dip dip
Cause I talk money while these haters talk shit shit
And if they keep on talkin I'ma empty out a clip clip
But I don't want no problems, I'm just tryin to get my game on
Take a couple shots and use the alcohol to blame on
Holla at some chicks and find a bitch to put my name on
Then I'ma be the, I'ma be the one she put that thang on
I got the perfect song to make your woman wanna shake shake
And take her to the crib, I don't take her on no date date
We all up in the club 'til the glass and table break break
And all they wanna know is how much more that I can take take

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Now keep the cameras flashin we about to shoot a movie
A thick chick let me sit my glass on her booty
She stuck up on my hip and she swear she ain't no groupie
While I'm stuck up in the VIP but everythang is all (Gucci!)
So I gathered all the women and we 'bout to take a shot shot
Gone out my mind, who's there? Nigga knock-knock
Don't you hear that 8-0-8 beatin down your block block?
Keep the party goin cause the party don't stop stop

[Chorus]</pre>
