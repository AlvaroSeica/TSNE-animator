[Yuin Huzami]
Yeah, basically huh, can't fuck with this

[Verse 1: Yuin Huzami]
I came to bring the flame, hardcore from the 'Bane
Whenever it's time to catch a plane
cry back(?) essentials, breaks instrumentals
records wait, need to find extra pencils
Yuin, I'm not the King but chillin in Queensland
an ace of the scene, can you do this?
Just how big can spliffs get
Bigger than your HECS, students at life now pass the test
You and your pink-collars think you got dollars
Probably only got creases on your foreheads
Hate your boss, feelings get tossed 
to the side, self-employed holding my torch
Of course it's the Yuin, Huz from the UN crew
Coalition, getting this accepted, respected
Fuck it, some beers and a trumpet
Lit it up and puffed it 
Pass it to Tongue, now he's dusted
Pounds, we bless enough sounds, Yuin Huzami shit
coming through your town, quicket
Bris-bane flavours down to rip stages
Bound to fuck a mic down to drop rhymes in blazes

[Chorus: Yuin Huzami]
Is it real Tongue, is it really real Tongue
Let me know it's real Tongue, if it's really real
Something I can feel Tongue, load it up and chill son
Want it raw deal Tongue, if it's really real

When I was a little stero (stereo)
I listened to some Black Stump (Black Stump)
I always wondered (wondered)
When I would be the number one
Now we listen to the Hilltop (Hilltop)
And the Muph &amp; Plutonic
And we puff on the best weed, and we live in Bris-bane

[Verse 2: Tongue]
Yo, brother's wanna hang with the Tongue
Bring the smoke and the fat hash cookies so my shit can be dope
Yeah, me and Huzami is on this
Puffing on the bush, better yet if it's chronic
Coming from the vet on some old Sydney town shit
Better show respect when you walk through my town shit
Spread a little love with this bomb(??)
It's my crew coming through, fence sitters best decide who they're down with
Yuin is the best, crowds bounce like counterfeit cheques
Is that the beat or the rattle of death?
Your choice, in this test called life it's like chess
Make a move towards the light, we righteous
Give me the wirless
Quick with the raw I record
22/7 got the rugged rhymes galore
Check it cos I spit hot when this hip hop's like proper
Fire in the booth when I'm all up in the booth
Mic rocker, no EQ, no flaws
When I kick a freestyle it's yours to hit the floor
I learned just how to do all that from Scott Burns
In 08' my own spot I burned
I don't need no chemicals yo to kick a flow
All I need is 'tables and mics to kill a show

[Chorus: Yuin Huzami]
Is it real Tongue, is it really real Tongue
Let me know it's real Tongue, if it's really real
Something I can feel Tongue, load it up and chill son
Want it raw deal Tongue, if it's really real
f'real

[Yuin Huzami]
That's right... I'll fucking cut your mic cord off 
and tell you that shit's wireless
I'll fucking... switch your instro disc with deep forest...</pre>
