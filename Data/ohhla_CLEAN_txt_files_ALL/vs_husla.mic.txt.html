[Iron Mic]
Now you don't wanna fuck with me
They call me I-R-O-N, M-I-C
You can't fuck with my team, nigga, please, you still fantasizing
Realizing, we Ruthless, I'm Iron
And, I ain't gon' waste my time firing
At your snitch ass, I heard you be harmonizing
Running to the police, when the temperature's rising
If you like your life, nigga, don't be mentioning Iron
Don't be, fucking with Ruthless, what the fuck, is you stupid?
Spend money on weed and guns, hit the block and re-coup it
That's right, I'm a hustler, baby, and you only crazy
Little nigga, til I lift up the eighty
Bring ya muthafucking senses back, I won't stop
Til I cop three sixes like them Memphis cats
Shot from the mack, and I'm jumping like Crunchy Black
I ain't no country, boy, I'm from New York, black

[Husla]
I don't need Henny to amp me up
I get, busy with mines, I cramp you up
You know, who I'm rolling with, Ruthless squad'll splurge
Dikes and birds who heist for the dope and the herb
We like Boston in 80, copping a Bird
Pushed the, biggest whip, the fluffiest fur
Stupid, diamond rings, etcetera, etcetera
Try to stop mines and, bet I'mma getcha
I ain't Whitney, so fuck a 'bodyguard'
If I want you to be quickly mighty hard
Your moms can get, your aunts and cuz
That's what you get for wannabe gansta, wannabe thug
My team all thugs and we all acquitted
And yea we still connect with Blizzard
It's R-U-T-H, you know the rest, you we live it
The time is now, ya'll niggas get with it</pre>
