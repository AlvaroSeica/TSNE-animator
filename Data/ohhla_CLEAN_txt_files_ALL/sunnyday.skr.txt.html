We rolling on chrome, flossing it's a sunny day
Feeling marvelous, blowing light green hay
All about our cash, we worked hard and got paid
Stacks multiplied, now it's time to parlay

[Lil' Flip]
It's a sunny day, so I'ma pull out the drop
No chain today, but I'ma pull out my watch
You know I'm iced up, looking like a wedding cake
I hear niggaz whispering, man I bet it's fake
But I got cash, ride around in drop Jags
With my top back, interior all black
With leather seats, rims dipped fo' times
I'm in a V-12, watch me blow by
You know me, I gotta put my stunt down
And when the laws pass by, I put my blunt down
Cause I stay high, like a telephone pole
And I roll on 4's, and pimp yellow bone hoes
Swangas and Blaze, is what we sit on
I'm talking on my flip phone, you get it Flip phone
Smoking on a zone, of that sticky icky green
Hoes see me in a Jag, and say Flip he be clean

[Hook: Shasta - 2x]

[Lil' Flip]
I'm at the beach party, in a pearl white drop
I had to take my bracelet off, cause the girls might bop
White Air Force 1's, Fat Albert tank top
Nike head band, long braids hang out
Hoes everywhere, man it's going down
The traffic so bad, cops saying turn around
But you know niggaz, we gon try to sneak in
Some niggaz going broke, trying to ball this weekend
And TJ, taking flicks with bad broads
Hump in the Benz, Redd in the Jaguar
We leaned out, you know our cars screened out
And if we ain't riding 20's, we chrome 19'd out
84's, got me shining in the lane
We been riding Blaze, stop stealing our slang
You know what, we really balling Down South
And all niggaz jamming Screw, and Swisha House

[Hook: Shasta - 2x]

[Shasta]
We rolling on chrome (rolling on chrome)
And we're looking good (you know we're looking good)
Gripping on wood, it's a sunny day in the hood

[Lil' Flip]
You see them 20's spinning, when I'm swanging down the strip
Diamonds hanging off my lip, my trunk banging like a Crip
Niggaz thinking I'ma slip, but I can't
If a hater try to jack, I'ma waste him like drank
I'm riding on a full tank, switching lanes like Maurice
Baguettes on my piece, Marquice on my teeth
Iceberg on my feet, with Speedy Gonzalez
Big Marv and Big H.A.W.K., yeah them my compadres
We ball everyday, Like Atino Mobley
I got a Cardier, but have you seen my Roley
I ride Navigator, it's my Navigator
I feel like Teela, bye bye haters
As I slide by Jamaica, sipping medicine
We wanna bring our cups in, but they won't let us in
So we hit Cornbread's, and went back to the house
I'ma hold it down for Screw, know what I'm talking bout
