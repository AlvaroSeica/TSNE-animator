[Ginuwine]
You think you know but you have no clue
No idea
You don't know G
I mean you really really don't Know G

[Chorus]
Niggaz get ready it's time to explore
The world of the real one
Niggaz get ready
Niggaz get ready it's time to explore
The world of the real one
Niggaz get ready

[Snoop Dogg]
Hell Yeah ya better get ready
What's cracka lackin
It's the big dog
I'm in the hizzle with my nizzle Gin U izzle
And I mean from playa to playa
It's only right if I gots to pass the throne
I gots to pass the throne
I gots to pass it to my nephew G
He's bonafide, Qualified, and the ladies would definitely testify
Matter fact G
Holla at them Nephew

[Ginuwine]
Fa Sho
Pass the Hennessey
I'm about to get bent
Toss the box of blunts
Let me roll the upper lip
Don't make me pop thangs
Cause I gets off the chain
You don't know me
But you're bout to
It's the real me
And I thought you knew

[Chorus]
Niggaz get ready it's time to explore
The world of the real one
Niggaz get ready (he coming at you full speed baby, but with a slow motion twist)
Niggaz get ready it's time to explore
The world of the real one
Niggaz get ready
Niggaz get ready

[Snoop Dogg]
I mean I mean Ginuwine is so official
Like a referee with a whistle
Better yet like a gangsta with a pistol
So you niggaz bettter get ready
Yeah I know
Matter fact G
Give it 'em doggy style
I know they ain't ready but they got to get ready
You do you I do me
And we keep it like a G
Pass me that Hennessey
Fa Sho

[Ginuwine]
Niggaz get ready it's time to explore
The world of the real one
Niggaz get ready (oh yeah and me, I'm right with it, I'm ridin shotgun)
Niggaz get ready it's time to explore
The world of the real one
Niggaz get ready
Niggaz get ready

Pass the Hennessey
I'm about to get bent
Toss the box of blunts
Let me roll the upper lip
Don't make me pop thangs
Cause I gets off the chain
You don't know me
But you're bout to
It's the real me
And I thought you knew

[Chorus]
Niggaz get ready it's time to explore
The world of the real one
Niggaz get ready
(I'm a show ya, I'm a let ya in so you better get ready)
Niggaz get ready it's time to explore
The world of the real one
Niggaz get ready

Niggaz get ready it's time to explore
The world of the real one
Niggaz get ready
(now it's about time to show you me
 so I'm gonna show you me, so I'm gonna show you G)
Niggaz get ready it's time to explore
The world of the real one
Niggaz get ready

[Snoop Dogg]
