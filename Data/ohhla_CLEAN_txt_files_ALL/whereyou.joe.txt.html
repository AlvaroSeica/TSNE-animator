[Intro: Joe]
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?
Baby where you at? Baby where you at? Baby where you at? Baby where you at?

[Verse 1: Joe]
Every word to touch you down it's playin in my head
Like a Scarface, crime scene, ain't no bringin it back
Those tears, didn't mean much then but now I know
That you said you don't feel it the wind starts to get cold
(Only) She's a woman like a car I replace it
(Mostly) I wonder if she saw this bullet comin like this
(Only) Words that I can hear in my ear
It's the gesture you 'gon see this soon as you plannin in the field

[Chorus: Joe]
(Baby where you at?) Ain't no sittin on my pillow case no more
(Baby where you at?) I just recognize I'm livin life alone
(Baby where you at?) I just I just wish you call me, damn this phone
(Baby where you at?) That's if I have four weeks
My whole life just flashed before me

[Bridge: Joe]
Oh, oh, oooh oooh oooh, how foolish could I be?

[Verse 2: Joe]
Wild as can be (Never) never fear bein humble (Humble)
Got in and out to face my fear, may never have a choice again
To be honest, with that one that was loyal to me
God really has his ways, of talking you off that stage
(Only) She's a woman like a car I replace it
(Mostly) I wonder if she saw this bullet comin like this
(Only) Words that I can hear in my ear
It's the gesture you 'gon see this soon as you plannin in the field

[Chorus: Joe] (*Papoose)
(Baby where you at?) Ain't no sittin on my pillow case no more
(Baby where you at?) I just recognize I'm livin life alone
(Baby where you at?) I just I just wish you call me, damn this phone
(Baby where you at?) That's if I only have four weeks (*Yeah!)
My whole life just flashed before me (*Papoose, Pa-poose)

[Verse 3: Papoose]
They say you never know what you have until you lose it
You promise your girl somethin you better do it
You can't tell a women you love her, are you stupid?
Words don't express your love you gotta prove it
Back then our relationship was the truest
Romance, slow dance to Joe music
As the time went on, I became foolish
Now your gone everything ruined
But girl this is Papoose, I'm on your favorite track
I know your friends in your ear,  but baby come back
And I never let you down, so later for that
I told you I was 'gon make it I'm the savior of rap
And I work hard you don't gotta cater for Pap
I tie my own durag, lay back and relax
You don't even gotta accept my apology
But I'm man enough to admit it acknowledge me

[Bridge: Joe]
Oh! Oh! Baby! If any one event it was just like me
Oooh! Oooh! Babe! Treat her like this wasn't last week
Won't you call babe? (Won't you call!!!) You know the song babe
Girl you know the song are you hearing me?!
Damn I regret running all overseas!!!

[Chorus: Joe]
(Baby where you at?) Ain't no sittin on my pillow case no more
(Baby where you at?) I just recognize I'm livin life alone
(Baby where you at?) I just I just wish you call me, damn this phone
(Baby where you at?) That's if I only have four weeks
My whole life just flashed before me</pre>
