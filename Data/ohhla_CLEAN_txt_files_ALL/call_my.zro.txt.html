Song:   Call My Phone
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus]
Bitch, you ain't gotta call my pohne
Matter fact, all you hoes can leave me alone
I just want my money
And nan one of you nappy head hoes, can get none from me
Nigga, you ain't gotta call my phone
Matter facet, all you niggaz can leave me alone
I just want my money
And nan one of my fake ass homeboys, gon' get none from me

[Z-Ro]
I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, even though I know you give great dome
I'd rather play my Xbox 360, while smoking and sipping drank
I ain't even gon' waste no gas going to get some ass, I'ma keep my gas in my tank
Leave my money in my pocket, I never leave it with hoes
Put a ring on my own finger, because I sleep with Z-Ro
Homie I don't give a fuck about what you drive, or how much money ya got
And I don't give a damn, if y'all really like me or not
I see your lips moving but I can't hear nothing, cause I'm not listening
Hoe you only talking to me, because my teeth are glistening and
Y'all niggaz be riding dick so much, y'all need a dildo
That way when you think about Z-Ro, you can shove it up in yo ass real slow
I'm a gangsta but I'm a man first, and I tolerate no disrespect
Lil' mama if it's money for me to make, we gon' skip the sex

[Chorus]

[Slim Thug]
I'm trying to stay rich, fuck a bitch
I'd rather hit the studio, and make another hit
Stop calling on my phone mayn, I'm on some other shit
Just leave a nigga alone, I ain't the suckers you fucking with
Cause bitch you ain't about to get no dime, or no quality time
I'd rather be on my grind, smoking weed writing rhymes
All you rapping ass niggaz, calling me to get signed
Want me to rap for free, you done lost your mind
I don't care how long I knew ya, or give a fuck if we kin
We went to high school together, give a fuck if we friends
You ain't tal'n bout shit, if you ain't tal'n bout ends
Bring me ten G's, I'll see what you tal'n bout then
All you roaching ass niggaz, and hoes in my face
Can't get a crumb from me, no so don't waste
Your motherfucking time, trying to plot on mine
I got my cash and my stash locked down, no now huh

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
It's a shame having a cell phone, but don't want it to ring
Cause I don't wanna deal with bullshit people, and the bullshit they might bring
That's why I send em to voicemail heaven, I don't wanna talk
Cause bullshit run a marathon, I'd rather keep it real and walk
I don't give a damn bout how pretty ya look, you can still kiss my ass
Especially if I gotta choose, between you and my cash
I'ma choose money every time, anyways I can always get a new bitch
Besides I'm what bitches be trying to find, I'm young black and I'm rich
If you thinking I'm gon' pay money, to hit that ass
I got a trick, for your ugly ass
I'll dismiss you right after I hit you, and then go fuck your friend
Then you'll be ready to commit suicide, if I never speak to you again
My nigga Grey-D my nigga Rick D, my nigga Michael Corleone
Them the only three niggaz phone number, programed in my phone
They call me the King of the Ghetto, because I rule this bitch
I'm bout bidness, I don't participate in foolishness bitch

[Chorus]</pre>
