[Intro]
A... C... E
O... F, uh

[Tyler, the Creator]
Wild, I'm not tamed - just because my visions are, strange
I am normal not deranged, I am not a fuckin lame
Your pee drippin wet, I need all my nutrients
On the phone, if I take you home, how much can I get?
Yeah I like you but, you act like you don't like us
We could start a whole new religion girl, in Odd we trust
You play hard to got, got me hard like cement
Here's my car I love please do not dip, please just

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
(Can you just) go {*3X*}
(But please don't) wait

[Tyler, the Creator]
I'm a fuckin monster, my Tonka is trucker
In my locker got books, I'm a nasty motherfucker
Truth or dare in the cemetery, right past the elementary
My faith could last for the whole century
You could bite my neck (or) I could bite your neck
(or) you could bite her and excite her you will not regret
My castle got dungeons, my dungeons got dungeons
Open up them legs, let me see what's for lunch and

[Chorus]

[Outro]
C'mon bitch!
And the sky is dark
The bats invade the park
The water swims the shark
But don't just wait, wait
Cum in her cum in her cum in her cum in her cum in... wait~!
And the sky is dark
The bats invade the park
The water swims the shark
But don't just wait, go
And the sky is dark
The bats invade the park
The water swims the shark
But don't wait just go
Just (go) just (go) just (go)
Just (go) just (go) just (go) aight
You cool Wade</pre>
