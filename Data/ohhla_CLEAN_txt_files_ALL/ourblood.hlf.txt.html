{Verse 1: Skrapz)
Broke then a mother fucker
The grave digger done ran all my jewels
I'm chilling underground
Buried in a box by these fools
That's been there
Knowing the struggle
Goes deeper where we coming from
Is a ghost town
I represent myself go fuck a Motown
Let's throw down
Like a chump, like a chump, like a chump
Did it all for the wicked shit
Knowing y'all bump
My heart pumps the blood
Although the virus chills in my veins
Y'all a peep kontamiNATION when it spills, it's strange
Y'all be reacting like we speaks of a fairy tale
Walk my bloodstains streets, and y'all'll know it's real
Fuck the recording industry
And fuck major labels
Fuck record sales, Halfbreed's gon' flip the tables
And tie you up to em, force you to recognize
The horrorcore bangs like Skrapz between thighs
And I blacks yo eyes, like y'all be blacking my name
This ain't no mother fuckin' game
You think I'm playing?
Y'all whack bitches wanna censor me talking bout a drug
While DMX shit, got him covered in blood
No love for the wicked
And we ain't never letting it go
This shit runs in our blood
Check my toe tag hoe

<chorus>
You can't stop a gang of Killas
We representing the wicked shit
Fuck you! whack hoes
GET OFF OUR DICKS!
Scared of the virus and they'll show us no love
But like we really give a fuck
Cuz it RUNS IN OUR BLOOD! Ha!

(Verse 2: Sol)
Virus
Kills billions of people
Sols half lethal
Only do it half the time for other people
Cuz I'm fully evil.
I'm bloodhound, hunt you down
In the midst of Armageddon
Just to save your life &amp; I kill you on Hollow's Night
Cuz I be threatening, the world
With bio chemical disaster
I'm in a rage
Horror raps
Alcoholics come out on stage, switchblades
All in all
Thought I was defeated like Malosavich
Dynamite sticks under their fluffy pillows
With special good night kiss
Unleash wars through your pores
Carving inches in your spine
Push diseases through enzymes
To fuck the world
Your soul's mine
Turpentine's Injected
Into women's breasts to feed their children
Maybe they conceive the wicked seed
I breathe recruiting civilians
For the half army
Who can harm me? Only god himself
I'm praying for help
It's stealth my help bes felt and
I'm bein pulled to hell
Do tell
The most horrific shit that's known to man
Make the body stiff and cold
My flow's ban
Deafen the whole land
You all shall fall before me
There will be no attempts to escape
Only to result in deeeeeeaaaath

<chorus>
You can't stop a gang of Killas
We representing the wicked shit
Fuck you! whack hoes
GET OFF OUR DICKS!
Scared of the virus and they'll show us no love
But like we really give a fuck
Cuz it RUNS IN OUR BLOOD! Ha!</chorus></chorus></pre>
