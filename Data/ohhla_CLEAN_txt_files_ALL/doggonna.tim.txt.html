[Tim Dog]
Yeah..
Yeah!...
Yeah...
 
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up, pick 'em up
Pick of another wack punk then stick 'em up, vick 'em up
Suckers get in my way
I don't play, so you're gonna get slayed
You wanna come and come and come and come
Come on bum and come and get some!
You know who the FUCK I am?
God-damn! Gimme a hand
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man 
with a lyrical hardcore plan -- God-DAMN!
Suckers wanna take me out, break me out
They can't MAKE me out
to be another wack emcee, 'cause that's garbage!
Tim Dog ain't goin out like that, black!
Matter of fact, come back
I'll be waitin with a baseball bat!
I'ma smack you in the dome
and I'ma send ya ass back home
I just want you to get the picture
The Dog's gonna getcha!
 
Yeaaaaaaah!!
Yeaaaaaaaah!!!
Yeaaaaaaah!!
Yeaaaaaaaah!!!
Yeaaaaaaah!!
Yeaaaaaaaah!!!
Yeaaaaaaah!!
 
Use me, confuse me
You must be stupid!!
Sniffin dope, smokin crack
I can never EVER be wack, ain't that right, black?
'Cause I'm the Dog baby baby
The Dog baby baby, the Dog baby baby
The Dog baby baby, the Dog baby baby
The DOOOOOG! -- I'm Tim Dog!!
Freddy Krueger can't fuck with me!
And I'm starring in Halloween 3!
Beware you wack emcees!
Bow down to your motherfuckin knees
You gotta get the pictuuuuure!
That the Dog's gonna getcha!
 
Yeaaaaaaah!!
Yeaaaaaaaah!!!
Yeaaaaaaah!!
 
AHHHHHHHHH~!!! I can't believe how DOPE I am!
I'm the motherfuckin man! 
Smackin emcees with one hand!
Don't cry, ya little BITCH! Be a man!
Do what you got to do! Learn what you got to learn!
It's your concern!
But if you're wack, I'MA COME AND GETCHAAA!
'Cause the Dog's gonna getchaaaaa!!!
 
Yeaaaaaaaah!!!
YEAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!
Yeaaaaaaaah!!!
YEAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!
