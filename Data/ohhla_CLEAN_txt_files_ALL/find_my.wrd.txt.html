[sample]
You must speak...
I cant.
You must, Its our only hope

[Werd]
Yes, S.O.S. 
Werd Mate, Untitled Scot, you don't know

This album has no set style (style)
Its just me trying to find myself (my sell)
This album is no set style (nah)
Its just me trying to find myself (my sell)
This album no set style (style)
Just me trying to find myself (my sale)
Yeah, trying to find myself (my sell)
Yeah, I'm trying to find my sale

Look, I've been rapping a while
I wouldn't recommend it its harder to smile
If I said I'm happy, ad be in denial
I feel so low so my solo style is
This, a mix of my tricks
Few bars up my sleeve and some spits I can give
Choose this over life, love, work and admit
That I'm no better off from the first time I writ
Shit, you don't know how I feel
Joint from the tray and a microwave meal
Watch TV, make a tune, no deal
Sleep, wake up, yeah same old spiel

This album has no set style (style)
Its just me trying to find myself (my sell)
This album is no set style (nah)
Its just me trying to find myself (my sell)
This album no set style (style)
Just me trying to find myself (my sale)
Yeah, trying to find myself (my sell)
Yeah, I'm trying to find my sale

Listen, I've been doing this a long time
Even though I'm unsigned find time to burn mine
Invest in this mess and I stress cause I cant wind
Back that clock just to stop now I can't, fine
Rhyme for another tune
Searching inside for a sign I aint understood
Why in my life I spite all what others choose
Even when I chose to be alone with a joint and brew
Never joining crews (nah) start my own
Writing down my lyrics, I start to grow
I see what's inside my mind and it shows
I'm just they think, so here's me exposed

This album has no set style (style)
Its just me trying to find myself (my sell)
This album is no set style (nah)
Its just me trying to find myself (my sell)
This album no set style (style)
Just me trying to find myself (my sale)
Yeah, trying to find myself (my sell)
Yeah, I'm trying to find my sale

Yo, I'll be here tomorrow
S.O.S. that's me never followed
One emcee, scene here, so hollow
Swallow you're pride I reside with a bottle of Buckfast
And will never make a fast buck
You want to blow but truth is rap sucks
You get left if you writing the right stuff
It aint right but its wrong just to give up
So, I wont change for the mainstream (nah)
Plan to change what is mainstream (yeah)
Can't say that's my main dream
You can keep the fame, I'll go un-seen

This album has no set style (style)
Its just me trying to find myself (my sell)
This album is no set style (nah)
Its just me trying to find myself (my sell)
This album no set style (style)
Just me trying to find myself (my sale)
Yeah, trying to find myself (my sell)
Yeah, I'm trying to find my sale</pre>
