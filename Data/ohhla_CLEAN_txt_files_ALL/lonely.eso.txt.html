Typed by: AZ Lyrics

* Deluxe Edition bonus track

I walk the lonely streets I watch the people passing by
I used to watch the falling rain and listen to the sleeper say...
every single word here now is coming right from my heartless heart and I...
I've never felt like this before this feeling.

I'm pure with my passion impossible to predict my mind is a mention
my heart is a gift the world doesn't owe you shit you owe the world everything
from the magic on this mic to there fake diamond rings
I create ryhming sing to get me were I am turn your headlights on
this heaven wer I stand an adventure with the sand people
to push the purity kindly conduct this bizz beautifully
They tell us to sit down ma people they'll stand up
cause yes bro eso is Houdini in handcuffs
sunrise moonshine another day lives a little
Reminder from god your money ain't shit
And that my ideas are bullet proof my teams in the house
my hope can't be hung my dreams can't be drowned.
Man makes money money doesn't make man
monkey see monkey do this monkeys got the upper hand. (rejoice)

I walk the lonely streets I watch the people passing by
I used to watch the falling rain and listen to the sleeper sayy...

Mother help me it's happened to my brain again the beat blazing
the flames descend so I become saint bein to be at peace with my monsters
the swords from the stone I'm the king of my genre
yeah I no I'm so bro bardic dependant on machines to grow does product
Makeing little seeds that'll die or stem out making your head north west bound
We've all made sacrifices like money and physical health
but I'm not ringin the bell sitching my belt up
When the bullshit blows I've never sold my soul
so there's a chance that I won't up in hell thus far
but I no that things change and I'll convince the devil
to free my soul from this instrumental
in my home land security over heats
I'll be over sea smoking weed with izm bliss n eso

Every single word here now is coming right from my heartless heart
I've never felt like this before this feeling

Ye I've bin feeling alrite keeping the quiet is kept to approach
knowing that these crews are the next to blow up right stand
on my own two feet we touch mics and demand that you focus please
feeling fortunate learning that Portland is where the hemispheres
converge on these coordinates I can gourge this shit ye of course we're sick
one listen will have you worshiping porcelin
I've bin more than a dreeg that feats you the knowledge
that I gained when I ate from the trees fruit
and now I pass it along become a passionate man that puts cash in his palm
bringing action to plans and my back getting strong feeling like atlas
and my fam is a faction relong on the tip of your tongue
I spit for the drums while the bassers on a rampage that's only begun

I walk the lonely streets I watch the people passing by
I used to watch the falling rain and listen to the sleeper sayy...

We gotta stop living for I and start living for we cause we all ball
on this ball together spinning so free I sing in the breeze
but they won't stay to listen cause individually they think we don't make a difference
Time to blow and break the business put the system into spin
I'm that midnight vagabond whose drifting in the wind
who just listens with a grin through chaos that mans facing
I'm speaking clearly but it's like it's lost in translation
Cause out the pavement we dried the orchids from the ground
and blazed with these mines in orbit
ye we find in portland that kids are free
the youth poetical polecs painting in an inconvinient truth
I'm that mind sleep walker travelling hellish dreams
bridging a playful ego and battered self esteem
whether it's a joke or hot whether it's dope or not
you want stop what's poppin out of my vocal box, it's like that</pre>
