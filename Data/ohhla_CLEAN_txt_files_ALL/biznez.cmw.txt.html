	(Everything I do gon' be funky)

	(This is serious business)
	(I'm from Compton, so you should know the deal)  (4x)
	(This is serious business)
	(Compton's in the house)

[ VERSE 1: MC Eiht ]
Let me explain the game that I'm performin
Before I get loced I give a warnin
Take cover, cause I blow up suckers like I'm atomic
Hittin harder than any, releasin rhymes like a bionic
Human, you're assumin that I've run out of luck
But I clock big bucks, so I don't give a fuck
If you play me, cause playin me means that you're jockin
For the food that I'm droppin and for the rhythms that I'm rockin
A criminal, recognized for rookies that I'm killin
Presidents I'm bankin for the raps that I'md ealin
So if you claim the fo', wanna go toe to toe
I got the heart to take you out with just one blow
Eiht means business

[ VERSE 2: The Chill ]
Here comes The Chill again
I drink gin to sin, because I'm in in to win
You want static? Punk, don't trip
Dope beats laid by DJ Slip
My lyrics go good with the groove
And while you're dazed, I pull a jack move
My rep never lets, no sucker slip behind me
Put the fools in check, so jack, don't even try me
Feelin like a villain cause I'm illin
And as I'm killin I'm chillin
And on the new jacks I'm stealin
Niggas gotta have it, girls wanna grab it
They on the tip like it's a habit
I mean business

	(This is serious business)
	(Cause I'm strictly business)  (4x)

[ VERSE 3: MC Eiht ]
I'm kinda pissed off, because you thought we was flops
What? It's CMW, punk, it's time to get mopped
Listen closely to what it's about
It's a petition, so we can boot your punk-ass out
I guess it's your fault, because the E got the feelin
That, yeah, you be nothin but another mercy killin
It started, and I recruit you like a trooper
Snatchin all those stupid party poopers
I mean business, so yo, don't even try
And geah, the E is potent like some Chocolate Thai
Like a poet my poetry thumps
Stick in a tape and watch your system bump

[ VERSE 4: The Chill ]
You played yourself out for the last time, sucker
No way, no how, no need, you say, "What the?!"
Chill's on the mic goin wild
Buck the fake rap new jacks with my Compton style
And yeah, I do it better than most, cause I'm the C
Down with E, A-n-t and S-l-i-p
DJ Rockin Tom got the back, so yo
Master Rick kinda slick, down with Jolly Joe
I take care of business, first intuition
Cancel all the sorry competition
So witness, first class sign, you say, "What is this?"
Another funky rhythm, cause yo, I mean business
