Hey yo, turn the headphones up a lil' bit
Alright, yea alright, umm, umm, yo yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo ,yo

Yo, ain't no mistakes, they say give and take
And if you know like I know, you gotta live the breaks
Numbing all the dope infested
Unprotected ghetto life style with killer crime records
I make it a point to understand this ain't wonderland
It's either kill or be killed, law of the land
Just to see that my mind expand rapidly
I can't lose sleep, I stay on my feet and flip enough to eat yo
Ain't nothing sweet when milk money ain't enough to feed the tummy
We mummified in this land of milk and honey
Home of the never free, become ghetto celebrities
Living in jeopardy, playing around where some will never be
Take it in stride, thats how we ride through the streets where I'm from
Trying to get some, hoping for the big one seven figures and them some
Make it and spend some, hustling with the man steady taking your income
Ya heard me?

hook

See you win some, you lose some
And then you spend some on em' when you choose em'
See it's a cold world, and it's a cold game
But if you learn to give and take it aint no thang (x2)

Nigga break bread with me, stay ahead with me
And if your loyal then you know your gonna fare it with me, say it with me
And play it with me rugged raw style
Respect my mind, I'm looking nothing like your product child
You know I let the beats bang and slowly do my thang
If you can't hang then say you can't hang nigga
What I deliver will give em' shivvers in the night time
And I ain't trippin' I just write rhymes about my lifetime
How I stand secure when the pressure endure
While the rest fall off they ain't sure
To mimick my methods I won't except it if the truth ain't true
I watch em' die in disguise wicked as voodoo
Niggas holler who, what, where, and when you wanna try
Know your dealing with a hustler living it do or die
Don't ask why, my nigga this just fate
In this life we life, you gotta give and take, thats how it operates

hook

I'm looking for a ONE-TIME in the summer in the city
Where the girls look good, but they attitudes shitty
With a fifty sack of sticky bailing up G Street
Through the corner projects hauling my heat
I heard they took my partner out the game last week
We come from the same streets now they trying to blast me
More money more murder, I'm cold-blooded and these hoes love it
But thats the quickest downfall and I'm for sho' you know
It's like time keep on slippin' and niggas keep trippin'
So I keep a nine with the clip in
Holstered up hot and heated
You can thank it's a game but come and see it to believe it
You ain't know, I'm representin' out that dirty-dirt
Southside nigga living untrustworthy
You heard me, where word be wicked and rotten
See a gun and nigga fuck what you saw
You know, for sho'
