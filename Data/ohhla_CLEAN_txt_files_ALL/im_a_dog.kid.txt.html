Come on, uh
See me ride across the country with my shotty ridin' shotgun
Got slimmy's on my Jimmy with magnums rockin' platinum
Wigs dig this, the fuckin' police know I see 'em
So I'm headed up to Reno like a geo and I'll greet 'em
Free my mind of life's inconsistencies
You got a lot but yo, you can't get these
Free my mind of life's inconcistencies
I had enough and you can swing on these

Cause I'm a dog, baby, see me ride across the country
I'm a dog, bitch, big suitcase full of money
I'm a dog, mamma, and I'm rollin' El Camino
I'm a d-d-d-dog, yeah

Drop-top continental with a suicide, see me ride
You by my side, big girl, yo, we will never die
I'll be your Hollywood eyes and send you swingin' baby
bring it home to poppa and Rock gon' make it jingle baby
It's a God damn shame people they look at me
But I know in the end you give a fuck about me
That's the reason I spit fire
That's the reason I'm a set your ass on fire, fire
I shoulda never left the bottle
And if they want the truth then tell them bitches I shot 'em

I'm a dog, baby, see me ride across the country
I'm a dog, bitch, big suitcase full of money
I'm a dog, mamma, and I'm rollin' El Camino
I'm a d-d-d-dog, yeah

Yeah, can ya, can ya
Can ya feel it now

Freedom or death, nothin' left to do but fill it up
Triple X eyes of lust and you need to give it up
Live it up sucker cause they're sayin' my days are numbered
Who wants to live long anyway
I'm goin' out with a blast, gettin' some ass
And smokin' grass, leavin' all my cash for my little boy
You wouldn't understand, you don't know where I come from
Hey, yeah, yeah

Cause I'm a dog, baby, see me ride across the country
I'm a dog, bitch, big suitcase full of money
I'm a dog, mamma, and I'm rollin' El Camino
I'm a d-d-d-dog, yeah</pre>
