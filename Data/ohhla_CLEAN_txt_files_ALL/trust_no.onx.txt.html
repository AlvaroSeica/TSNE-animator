[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known not to trust that bitch (BITCH!)
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known not to trust that bitch (BITCH!)
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known not to trust that bitch (BITCH!)
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known.....

[Verse One: Fredro Starr]
Yeah! Uh! If I was you I wouldn't piss off them guys
'Cause they hit you with them pistols and they stick you with them knives
What you sniffin crystal why you twitchin with your eye?
Niggas dry snitchin need stitches for they eye
If you snitch you get stitches quick, me and my constitutes
Bitch niggas must be on bonds bitch you wish
Clap you and that bitch toy with six what I hit you with
The more people you fuck over the more rich you get
Don't get caught up in a situation
Get stuck up while you sittin waitin, on that bitch you datin
Just a stipulation, of a chick you scrapin
Or the one you holdin hands on that bitch you makin
Your bride to be, see that first bitch she lied to me
Found out, all the shit she hide from me
The whole time thought this chick was gonna ride for me
I put the gun to the head let he die with me

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known not to trust that bitch (BITCH!)
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known not to trust that bitch (BITCH!)
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known not to trust that bitch (BITCH!)
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known.....

[Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz]
Since the day we met I don't even ride with you
Fuck chillin is you kiddin I would die for you
I use to love you bitch but I can't love you no more
What you paradin around town like some god damn whore
You cheated on me, you wasn't loyal at all!
If anybody gave you some rap, you gave 'em the draws
It's no wonder you got raped by a pack of niggas
Nowadays all you is is just ass and tits
Use to sound so beautiful, use to feel pure
Use to make me feel good about goin in raw
But you ain't been the same ever since you moved down south
Heard a bunch of ATL niggas chant you out
I got pictures, videos and tweets all quick
Even heard you been suckin some R&amp;B dick
Damn! You was my hip hop bitch
I mean you was hip hop, and you was my bitch!

[Chorus: Fredro Starr]
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known not to trust that bitch (BITCH!)
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known not to trust that bitch (BITCH!)
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known not to trust that bitch (BITCH!)
Never trust no bitch, niggas should've known.....
