[Chorus 2X: K-Blunt]
Zuuuuuuu Zuuuuuuuuuu (Zu Ninja!)

[K-Blunt]
It's a new year, good to stay prepared
Strapped with ya microphones and ya battle gear
Hey, look, listen here, how you spell fear?
I spell it y'all motherfuckers just best beware
And watch who, who, who you be talking to, to, to
I mean that Ninja standing next to you, he's down with Zu
The weapons too, strike and fast to you
I caught a chill in my spine, just warning you
It shouldn't sound strange, this flow will never change
And then it's to be passed on, like family reins
You better listen, man, cuz some of these niggaz is untamed
And just wanna prove something to the rest of the game
Trained, aimed, ready and able to shoot out pain
With every two in the game, killed ya name, claimed ya fame
Left yours so ya peers could hear the horns bang
Now that's a damn shame, bring the mourners, sang!

[Chorus 2X]

[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]
Ninjaz, we back, like flipping crack
Assassinate all these wack cats with rap
So here's a smack from this hardcore sword
MC's they got me bored, you won a Grammy, you won a BET award
So I'm here to pick at y'all niggaz like sores
Trapped ya CD in stores, catch ya ass on tour
Give you war, kipnap ya boss, mud out ya whore
I'm so raw, kicked down ya door with my Ninja boars
So here's the ransom note "Quit rap or start getting acts"
Left pieces like puzzles, I do this for Russell Jones
Get my hustle on, so go 'head, nigga, bleed
While I celebrate this shit like New Years Eve
'06 takeover, hip hop makeover, the wait is over
I do this shit for sober
No cigarettes, no smoking trees, just killing my enemies

[Chorus 2X]

[kung fu sample]
The elements: wood, water, fire and earth
I know it, a samurai skill</pre>
