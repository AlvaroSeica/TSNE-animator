[Nicki Minaj]
Why is it that you can only see the worst in me
I swear sometimes it feels like it nurtures me
But to keep I all real is kinda hurtin me
I can say am done with it but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedez
And I might pop a couple of them purple seeds
Yeah that will make me transform to Hercules

[Hook]
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am

[Nicki Minaj]
I swear to God man everythin in life is old
And the only thing that change is the price of gold
Even in the after life, I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around I'll be twice as gold
So do you take me to be who I am
To have in a hole 'til death do us part
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start
You got me thinkin twice to just breathe
And you say I won't survive if I leave
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
I no longer need your attention, at least

[Chorus]
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keepin score
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keepin score
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar

[repeat Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Here I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am</pre>
