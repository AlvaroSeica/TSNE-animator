[Intro]
"Shit!"

[Wafeek]
Don't nobody wanna hear me holla "Screw the system"
Nowadays use a euphemism
Instead of sayin you starvin, you, you can say you fastin
And you ain't gettin ass cause you focused on yo' craft
Hangin with the locals on the ave
That don't mean the nigga goin postal with the locos on the path
to Hell, with this rap bitch
She say I got the glow, but it's like datin Dr. Manhattan though
You gotta +Watchmen+ when we get emotionless
Cause that's often when we get to gropin chicks
that's not you, it's the +Resident Evil+
Milla Jovavich, and she really get me over...

[Chorus]
Think you can play yo' competition
(No competition) like there ain't no game
(It ain't no game) cause there's no way
(There's no way)
That you would ever get close to a victory at all
(Victory at all) if you're la-zy
(Bwoy)

[unknown speaker]
Welcome to the Feek Show!

[Wafeek]
Yeah, I'm a Midwest nucca, harder guy to name
like a terrorist nucca, light up {?} day
with no Arabic scripture, Islamic braille
For this Wafeek just flips all the way
A Persian lady with tits on display
Them boobies been hidin with Bin Laden
So go on get up out there; and I ain't talkin shit
Quite the opposite but thanks for the compliment
We vacation in foreign lands
I wilted and run like bomb bomb Iran
If you offer your handbook you marry don't quit her
You could be my broad, and I could be your
I could be your nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
