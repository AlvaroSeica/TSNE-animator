so there it goes, not the average nigga

that mothafuckas ain't shit to me
white nigga, black trigga cracks every mothafuckas back
late in a day, fools used to get they squabs on
the blood gang deuce nine creep mobb zone
runnin a mothafucka like a pittbull, loadin up that clip tool
but stealin on muthafuckas like a clepto

half the mothafuckas smokin niggas like wood
got locked up with they cock up, some other niggas asshole
but atleast my niggas had enough heart to blast though

leavin em only one chance to die and niggaz wanna used a glock
niggaz wanna go to heaven but don't want to get shot down
yeah, with my 38 snotnose
i got niggaz crawlin to me tryin to grab me for the hella hoes

and when i grab my 9 millimeter gun, point it to your back
