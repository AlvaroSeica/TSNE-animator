[Intro: Fifth Flight "Can't You See" sample]
"Now, now you're gone"
 And I feel so lonely, I don't know what to do"

[Pressure]
Now you're gone, life moves on without you
You always wanted me to write a song about you
Where to begin? I caught her in a fling
They've been asking where you've been, so I thought I'd fill 'em in
See there's nothing that I wouldn't put past you
When she got a lot of men, that's the harsh truth
You find the truth hard to swallow? Gotta ask you
Kind regards, I've been doing well these past few
She's a master with plans and a terrible feud
Leaving scars on a man if she's ever pursued
Even after you're damned and aware of the wound
Your beating heart's in her hand like the 'Temple of Doom'
She's a beast in disguise of a sweet song siren
that feasts on admirers, so keep on driving
Unleashed like the virus, Calici, we're blinded
and weak, so she thinks she can keep on lying?
Enough is enough, it's just counter-productive
when trust is inductive to being so fucked with
and love is a high you can buy in a substance
Know what? Fuck this, it was always destructive
I'ma let you know I've let you go
You'll never affect my mode, get dressed and go
You better test the road, so step and know
you're left alone to be another stepping stone, it goes

[Chorus 2X: Fifth Flight "Can't You See" sample] + (Hilltop Hoods)
"Now, now you're gone" (now you're gone)
 And I feel so lonely, I don't know what to do" (I don't know what to do)

[Suffa]
She slept on the couch for about four days or so
then 'left' like a southpaw bout four days ago
I'm blessed with a mouth that can outtalk ASIO
But from this fallout my poor mouth couldn't save me so
now I spend my days alone playing me some Maseo
Telephone messages, I doubt she ever plays 'em though
CD on the stereo, 'TV on the Radio'
'I Was a Lover', but the love, it couldn't save me though
Baby don't play me, don't break me yo, save me
Don't make me go crazy, like saying 'Don't taze me, bro'
Maybe you're right and it's all for the best
and maybe you're right, but I'm all you have left
When the best friends head for the S bend, less than zero
You'll need me like a western hero
You used to use my chest as a pillow, paro
Now my heart is just a target for an arrow, like

[Chorus 2X]

[Suffa]
Every breath you take is filling the
lungs that hug the heart that's killing me
Feelings Suffa foster for her, lost her
'Not my lover', Billy Jean
So pretty please, to a girl so pretty, please
You really need to not make me crawl like a millipede
You feeling the fool? Maybe you're not fulfilling me
But silly me, I'm feeling this filly's all I really need, like

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
