[Frank Ocean]
I'm afraid to say it
Don't wan't you to think I'm playin
My mistakes take the pretentiousness down like I'm standin naked
Hear the crowd and I sorry I know that I'm wrong yeah I'm wrong
If I could I'd go back I'm exposed give me back my clothes
cause I just can't take it
But look at you, loving a fool, makin it easy
I guess it's cool naked, but you already seen me

[Chorus]
Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I'm wrong, comfortable
You don't mind them flaws
You've already seen them all
Still got me feelin so comfortable
Feelin so comfortable

[Frank Ocean]
You keep on forgiving, rewrote all my wrongs in pencil
When you stay it makes me forget that I'm down, now it's all so simple
'Til the end, even when, I look dumb like I do when I lie
Feels so good letting go I'm exposed, you can have my clothes
cause I'm not afraid
But look at you, loving a fool, makin it easy
I guess it's cool naked, but you already seen me

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
It don't matter it don't matter no, you've seen it all before
It don't matter it don't matter, you've seen it all before
It don't matter it don't matter no, you've seen it all before
So comfortable, so comfortable, so comfortable

[Chorus]</pre>
