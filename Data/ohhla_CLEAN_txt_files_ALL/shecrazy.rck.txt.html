[Aaliyah]
Yeahhh Mhmm Mhmm

[Rick Ross (Talking)]
You know sometime in life shit get so crazy
I wanna smoke one for my nigga peanut
That's my brother forever nigga I love you nigga
Your son mine nigga
let me check this bitch right quick though

[Verse 1]
Been through alot 9.0 times it gets cold
doing bad had you take dope off the road
had a situation where she kept it g as fuck
sometimes realer then the niggas that I trust
runing in banks
walking out stores anything that I needed signature she would forge
fucked up her credit overdue rental cars it was all 50/50 in this lil thing of ours
girl used to lace me shoplifting at macy I just loved that fact that she really did embrace me
then she started dancing really didn't phase me
started popping pills that's when shit got crazy
money come and go but the trill will remain
when this rap shit pop I told her that I never change
have been stacking change and I gotcha a lil' cut
when we meet again girl we can live it up

[Ne-Yo - Chorus x2]
(ooooh) and no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
Its just me and my
(ooooh) just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together (ooooh)

[Verse 2]
Smokin' weed looking at your picture on the wall
I remember hittin' licks then we both hit the mall talkin' new kicks
cologne
down to the drawers
raised like brothers but this dope game flaw
things that I saw really made me wanna change
this a shame what 5 dollars do to niggas veins
after graduation bestfriends parted ways
fuck house parties now its time to get paid
we were movin' white while my niggas touchin' the H
we were still broke but money was on the way
shit were goin' great til' my nigga called the case
dna master homicide back in '98 fucked up plans incarcerated my man
took his lexus jeep diamond rings of his hand, damn
but you can't take a real nigga legacy legends live forever
so my letter reads

[Ne-Yo - Chorus x2]
(ooooh) and no matter the time or the place in the matter the crime
Its just me and my
(ooooh) just me and my
Do it all through whatever we stay together (ooooh)</pre>
