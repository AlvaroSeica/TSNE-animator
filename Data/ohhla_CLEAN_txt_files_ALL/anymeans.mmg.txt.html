[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Pork on the fork (HUH), white in the pot (HUH)
By any means, if ya like it or not (WHOO)
Malcolm X (WHOO), by any means
Mini fourteen stuffed in my denim jeans (HUH)
As-Salamu Alaykum, Wa'alaykums-salÄm
Whatever your religion, kiss the ring on the don
Real nigga, street certified
Hit the streets whip cost three-thirty-five

[Meek Mill]
Meek Milly, yeah
No pork on the fork (no pork) but itâs white in the pot (pot)
We charging you niggas up you like it or not (ha)
Drop the work off the scale (scale), throw some ice in the pot (pot)
Then let that Arm &amp; Hammer, hammer it right to a lot
Tryna whip a Rollie (Rollie) or Cartier (tier)
Shout out to this Pyrex, that bought this Audemeer (bling)
Oops I meant Audemar (ha), my whole team got them
You loving the same bitch, my whole team poppin (ha)â
One hundred dough, Iâm wherever that money go
Glock 9 in my underclothes, you cop two of them, we frontinâ 4
Fuck niggas we don't fuck with those (no), bad bitches never loved them though (no)
Keep them round but never trust them no, this 62 so comfortable, HAH~!
Iâm a field nigga (field nigga), you a house nigga (house nigga)
Iâm a real nigga (real nigga) and youâs a mouse nigga (mouse nigga)
Code red (code red), which means you go red (go red)
But I donât knock you I just blame it on your old head, rats

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Yeah, Wale though, uh
Malcolm X: Get yo hand out my pocket
Some niggas walking with death, guess they ran out of options
Tell them niggas we movin, tell them niggas to do it
I swear we going H.A.M though some my niggas sunnis
They burn on every block, snitches here don't got no heart
Shit ain't been the same since Ronald Regan helped Plymouth Rock
And we ain't land on that, Mr. Reagan
But this gon make us rich, Mr. Reagan
Now, As-Salamu Alaykum Wa `alaykums-salÄm
She kneel down every Friday and then go to Jummah
Let em play with her box, she give the greatest top
She say these niggas is her pray and she makes Salah
Word, how they say that we not fly? How they say that we not workin'?
They just need convincing like Malcolm little 'fore he converted
I'm on my grind, I'm on my deen Inshallah, I'mma get 'er right
On the bible you can run but you can't hide

[Chorus]

[Pill]
Marching for cause, they put a hole in it
Start the applause, a rebel soul lifted
Preaching for the paper, paparazzi, federales
Several rallies, mass, Allahâs teachings through Shabazz
Thatâs Malik Omaha, Nebras
Corruption over cash, leave them leaking in the caskâ
Ain't better, you better rebel, smell cheddar and shells
Malcolm envision platinum in Africa when he sat in a cell
My religion the kitchens, papa formulas
Benjamins to make sure my pockets abnormal
My philosophy is rocks and weed, a pot to lean, the Glock will squeeze
Niggas clocking dollars donât know how to read with mouths to feed
Itâs hard when starving Marcus Garvey messed with Malcolm Little
Knowledge was obtained, fuck your chains and your master nigga
We in the field building muscle while you watch the house
And dusting off the porcelain and open when their cock is out

[Chorus]
