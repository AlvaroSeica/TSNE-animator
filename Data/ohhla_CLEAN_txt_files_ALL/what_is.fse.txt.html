[Intro: Leathafase]
Hillside, Stone Gang, Face Leather.

[Chorus 2X: Leathafase]
Life what is it worth, To push you into the Earth
I let your arteries squirt, A little blood on my shirt
Don't worry this won't hurt, Soon as the nine mil jerk
I'll blow the back of your brains, Bury you under the dirt

[Leathafase]
I post choke'n the glock, Plus I'm holding a rock
Dog I'm falling on the block and it's crawling with cops
My niggas love me a lot and tell me dead on the spot
That they'll jump in front of the bullet, Before I get shot
My heart is boiling hot, So I'ma do it the same
Run up on you like the narcs and push two in your brain
It's all Kool and the Gang, Son I'm doing my thing
You try to ruin my dream I'll make you a permanent stain
As I burn em into flames worse then Puffy in the ad-libs
A pistol grip shotgun is known to crack ribs
Mad kids running in the park, I'll unfasten your wigs
And give em nightmares for years to come, You dig
Taking a swig of Remy Martin straight in a plastic cup
Short fuse lit, I wild out til your plastered up
That's what up, A complex plan of attack
Causes my goons to move in synchronized killing packs
Spray off heavy artillery, My frame's still intact
And baby my dick is a dog, In the bed killing cats
Brraaatt, She likes it like that, She could never refuse
The essence of this thug's passion, Making her juice ooze
Now I ate the pussy once, But don't get it confused
That was the Mother of my son, Before she got used
I refuse but rapidly learn the rules of the G code
Never explode, Just brush'n off the shoulders like so
Then I was told, Never turn a hoe into a house wife
But yo, I think I turned a house wife into a hoe
Here we go, Another episode, The wild world of Leathafase
Deep throat the nine and tell me how the Beretta taste
A cold case file, Is now an unsolved mystery
Turn a rapper into a dead rapper and make him history
It's the consistency of the baking soda and base
That got me saying you aint shit with my gun in your face
Make no mistakes son I'm real hard, What is you a retard
My God squad would transform and start the holy jihad
I arise flames, Liquid lead raining
Sick with the dead aim when I'm military campaigning on you

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
