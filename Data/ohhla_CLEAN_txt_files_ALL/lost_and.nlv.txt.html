{Hook: Tec-9}
Little miss hot pants runnin the streets
Tryin to come up on a couple of G's
Infatuated by the Bling Bling
Such a shame to see she's lost in time daaaaaaaawwwwwwwwggg
Lost in time daaaaaaawwwwwwwwwggg

{Verse 1: Tec-9}
Now my theory is clearly controversial
But let a nigga speak on it because this shit is universal
Dont need rehersal to tell yall how it really goes
Yall see it like I see it, a high in tight clothes
Earings everywhere but where they supposed to go
The legs fold with the high pro glow
15 and lied and said she 17, so misguided
She didnt even have a dream, shes so excited
That she got a little shape
Got ya self caught up and now they got ya shape on tape
Now what ya daddy gon think when he see dat
Ya betta hope dat ya daddy dont see dat
So embarressed 'til one day she decided to run away
And thats when my man introduced her to Yay
Coke fiend still in her teens, sellin her body
Lost in time dawg and she cant even hide it
Ya heard me

{Hook}

{Verse 2: Lil Ya}
Now I'ma take it back to when it first started
When we used to chill slingin rocks, drinkin 40's
Shorty used to peep a playa out through the window
13 years old aww she's gonna be a nimpho
Claim to be grown, she never respected her mama
Tried to leave home and then she ran into some drama
Met a old tymer who turned her out on that crack
Ya gettin real small yet ya stomach lookin fat
Started poppin pills left the baby in the trolly
Thought you had a man 'til ya found he wasnt for it
Now ya kinda drove all alone 14
Sprung to the streets cause use a dope fiend
Cant go home cause ya know ya burned some bridges
Messed up wit moms tryna be that man's mistress
It aint the first time I done saw what yall tossed
Baby thought she knew what she was doin she was lost

{Hook}

{Verse 3: ??}
Girl maintain, dont let that jive tape sent to you drive you insane
If he aint right by you, you know what you need to do
Leave that busta dont take the abuse you dont need that sucka
Hold on be strong you can carry on without that trouble
Dont doubt yaself girl as long as you got ya health girl
You could do yourself stop dependin on the streets fa help
Beutiful black queen you a Gem, diamonds cant compare
When you pass you got me chokin gaspin fa air
Independent women taken care of business
Live ya life you dont need to be stressed in this world
That aint right I feel yo pain
Dont get fed up you got to keep ya head up
Maintain ya frame of mind
Peep game when its rainin

{Tec-9}
Peepin all around nobody dont even remember your name
People think ya burned out and thats a shame
How ya felt short to the pimpin game
Peepin all around nobody dont even remember your name
People think ya burned out and thats a shame
How ya felt short to the pimpin game
