You know we banging on the front line

Here to salute - I got a lot of beautiful women
Shouts out to all the beautiful women worldwide
Bitches wanna fuck me daily

[Chorus]
Take a pic, you are a superstar
On the road, Basedworld Paradise [x3]

Niggas can't fuck with me Imma tell you like that
Broadie talkin fast, woadie whats that
He ain't got no bitches, broadie whats that?
I'm still counting money, I'm still counting hundreds
I'm still fucking hoes, broadie bounce back
Flex fifteen, fuck two bitches

Fuck niggas can't come, fuck niggas can't party
Shoutout to my best friend, punk bitch gon' fuck me
Slap bitches and jack niggas, jack niggas and slap bitches
Everyday on the front line, Mick Foley, Steve Austin
Rich nigga get a flight to Boston

Chopping niggas for the fuck of it
Cuffer hoes I love the bitch
Fuck nigga I love hoes
No shame I been saying
Hit licks I'm not telling
Open up my spot in heaven
Fuck nigga I'm a fucking gangster little bitch
