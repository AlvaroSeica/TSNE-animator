[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Watch out, my outfit's re-di-culous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And RAWR!! These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow
And forget about game, I'm a spit the truth!
I won't stop till I get em in their birthday suits!!
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off wit their clothes
Then "bend over to the front! and touch your toes!!"

If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrollll (oww!!)
How ya like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thou-sand!
Let's drink, you the one to please

We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed that say
