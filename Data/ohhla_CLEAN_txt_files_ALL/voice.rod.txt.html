Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: sample]
In my head, the voice is waiting
Waiting for me, to set it free
I locked it inside my imagination
But I'm the one, that's got the combination
So people didn't like what the voice could say
So I took the voice and I locked it away
I got the key, I got the key
Voices, I hear voices
Voices, I hear voices

[Cno Evil]
In my head, is where these words were said
Where these thoughts were kept, where those feelings bled
Where ideas lead me, to a life full of envy
Made my body angry, with actions that shred me
Inside, so that provokes my outside
Voices, not many choices, no more rejoicing
Hoisted above ground, I elevate to top floors
Locked doors, what for? I got up to explore
Got down, so I can crack the sound underground
Six feet under, the thunder shock pounds
Lighting with fighting, so why you sharks biting?
You should be using your head for new writings
See? Now isn't that exciting?
I'm inviting you, the universe uniting
Verbs spill out my brain into paragraphs
Sharp words that cut yours in half
Like blood spilling into a bath
Down the tube, Rubik's Cube, apply math
Laugh, giggle, just chuckle
My words stay tight like the belt with the buckle
Around your waist, I'll just pound your face
Or go, out of town, with the sound of space
'Eraser' like Arnold, have your 'Terminated' like Donald Trump
Got your 'Men Running' from 'Predators', 'Recall' your 'Total' sums
'The Last Action Hero' with the last gun
'True Lies', two guys, look like 'Twins', but just one
Cloned like 'The 6th Day', so what you gotta say?
I say the 'Damage' is 'Collateral', so you gonna repay me
Set me free, but you don't have a key
It's waiting for me, to come, with the M-I-C
I got the combination, cuz I am the creation
Is this reality or could it be imagination?

[Chorus]

[Cno Evil]
Now it's time, to let everything go loose
On a crazy chase of a search like a wild goose
Looking for one thing, something of nothing
Zero divided by zero, the heroes will get summoned
Invincible like Marky Mark, or, Iron Man Tony Stark
Confined in a suit of metal to preserve my heart
It can never slow down, I gotta keep it beating
Like Chev Chelios, injected with the Cocktail from Beijing
The only remedy is steady adrenaline
Even better, a massive amount of epinephrine
Now I got the deadly sin
Stronger than poison, stronger than venom
Times five, impossible to survive
It's probable that I'll die, no hospital can revive me
So I stand still, holding the key
Lonely with nobody to see, what I see
And know what I know, so you know how that goes
C to the N-O, Cno, the Evil's just an ego
So I stand tall like an eagle, law stays illegal
My people after me, you will see the sequel
Pray for me, on your knees, at the cathedral
And set me free, like a victory, no one equal
No more rhymes with my name, I got no more time, no games
No more playing, no more entertainment, I'm just saying
It was trapped in my head, for a quarter of a century
Suspending me, not in time, but in a dimension, see?
My heads about to explode like it's full of tension
The creation that was brainstormed from an invention
The prevention many escape, the prison break type fate
Running down my face, sliding down my back
Rocking out the place, rolling down the track
Hip hop the fuck out of here, and pop your ears from the fears

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
