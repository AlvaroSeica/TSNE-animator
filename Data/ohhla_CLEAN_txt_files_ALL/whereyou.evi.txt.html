"You either build or destroy..." - Jay Electronica

[Intro]
It's a lil' storyy... (I see)
Push it back, push it back, uh
C'mon, uh...

[Evidence]
(And once again it's on) I guess I'm on that
Once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
To tell the climate of pain, it's like the rain told the weather (c'mon!)
Sometimes you move towards the wolf pack
And go huntin down mamis in wool slacks, I pulled the reins back 
Horse on the race track, dogs and same cats
Fallin on down, they used to be +London Bridges+
But they all on the ground, broke down to little ridges
It's a, simple story of build and destroy
I'm like the judge's hammer, slammin the villain to void
Killin his boys, killin his girls, killin they world
Feelin like the third Mobb, +Hell+ on this +Earth+
I spit verses, there's better ways to pay the rent and shit
It's not ideal, still I deal sentences
Graduated to stardom from apprenticeship
Emphasis reversed, from Exodus to Genesis

[Chorus: Lil' Fame]
Catch it when we drop that
Plant seeds, grow those trees, then we chop that
Twistin up that old green life, then we burn that
When will you motherfuckers learn? We build and destroy!
AHHHHHHHH~!! Catch it when we drop that
Plant seeds, grow those trees, then we chop that
Architect, leave a big hole where your block at
When will you motherfuckers learn? We build and destory!

"You either build or destroy..."
"You either build or destroy..."
"You either build or destroy..."
"You either build or destroy, where you come from?"
