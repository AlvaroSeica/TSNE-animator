Water Torture. Drop this on ya
Hostage. Mode Impossible
YOUR Infantry forgot to Warn ya
I Control the Blocks and Corners
Bobby Seale or Rocky Horror. I should call the doctor for YOU, Naaaaw..
WE making such a blatant Statement
Dangle 'em like baby Blanket
Hang 'em by the ankles. Racist, if the Race was ignoramus
Infiltrate the hit created. Let's change the fate of ML-KING, J-R. R-R-R
Baskin', in the ACT committed
Blastin', with assassin vision
Ravagin', with bad intentions, damaging the Black Existence
Capturin', YOUR Flag, Confederate, when skippin' pass the Dixon Line
NORTH to SOUTH to EAST to WEST
WE Torture Doubt, Defeat Oppression, Nostradamus, Ether records
WE stomp 'em out, Godzilla/Gamera
Chalk 'em out, like teacher's test
WE walkin' out with Lethal Weapons, BLAOW!

CHORUS:
They throw US Money just to set US up
And, get the Best of US
They try to treat US like WE Property
They reel US in then they abandon US
But, WE had enough
They'll never keep US under Lock and Key

Where YOU been and Who's ya Master?
That ain't YOUR Scroll and Tablet, it was written by some Rapper
YOU stole his Soul and Actions?
WE came with swords and maskmen
Took YOUR awards and fashions
Like caped avengers, eighty ninjas overboard, ATTACK 'EM
Drag him through the Gauntlet screamin'
He just a Dungeon Demon, Underwater Satan seaman
I wonder what's the Reason?
Maybe for Fame he Fiendin', Label teasin' made him break his crown
THEY ALL FALL DOWN
Poor Humpty Dumpty drops to shambles. Revealing his mock enamel
All the Kingsmen franticly crawl to replot and scramble
Meanwhile I block the channel
Thats all my knot handle
Why WE gotta choose between a Sambo and Mob Soprano
Blow the horn like tenor-sax, he went from ten to six in platinum
The overworked Indigenous, they work from ten to six
He Guilty while they Innocent, but still he filthy rich from makin' hits
Tempting them to make a hit and split his wig

CHORUS:
They throw US Money just to set US up
And, get the Best of US
They try to treat US like WE Property
They reel US in then they abandon US
But, WE had enough
They'll never keep US under Lock and Key

Man, they Hate to see my Armor shining
My Army line up, trumpets sounding like it's Armageddon
Naw, no need for sirens
OUR Labels make contracts
Yea, WE taking Office
WE presidential with Bomb Threats
Man, this Land was Promised
Not waiting for Patriots' appraisal or YOUR Congress
WE making OUR own timetables, multiplying checks
Offers and Sponsors, Officers in high seats
As far as my Third Eye see, I'm Free
Yo tell me, do YOU wanna have it ALL? Or, just be employed?
Naw, if I can't be the BOSS, I'd rather be a D-Boy
Now tell me what YOU'D rather do, wait a slave or make a move?
Man, I'd rather break the rules than hang in that fatal noose
This is for the crews and settlers, scoundrels and peddlers
The meddlers and gamblers, caught up in the Culture
Where they spending millions robbing others for they Fortune
GIVE UP OR GIVE IN. YOU CAN'T GET OVER: FEEL THE TORTURE</pre>
