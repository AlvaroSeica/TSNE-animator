Song:   Do Something
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ay, ay, ay
Say dis real rite here ya heard me
Niggas jus don't neva stop hatin
Ay

[Chorus 2x]
I think somebody tryna do me somethin
(do something) cause I can't sleep (do something)
And I'm nervous when I eat
(do something) and I ain't even got no beef (do something)
But it feel like I got beef (do something)
cause I ain't slept in a week (do something)
And I ain't takin a step outta my door without that heat
(do something)

[Verse 1]
I think somebody tryna do me something
cause I cant sleep
My mama cooked a meal for me but I cant eat
Its too much shit on my mind
i can't stop thinkin bout dyin
so whoeva cross that line
you gon get dat .45
My daddy jus got home
but they jus came and got my nigga poor Victor
Feelin got caught up wit two choppas and a pistol
And I'm beginning to hate these rap niggas real fast
Put my name on a track I'm gon come where you at and blast
Just the other day I almost had to do a nigga
He thought I was go fight him
but I was gon shoot a nigga
Now I know that sound fucked up
but I ain't got no time
Soon as you whip a nigga he jus gon go get
his iron, his nine, or his ruger, howeva he wanna do ya
I ain't thinkin, I ain't talkin, I ain't boxing I'ma shoot ya
His nine or his ruger, howeva he wanna do ya
I ain't thinkin, I ain't talkin, I ain't boxing I'ma shoot ya

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
I think somebody tryna do me something
I see him lookin
Come play me like a rookie
watch how quick I leave you shooken
I hop outta the bushes wit that thang like surprise
and if you try to run then that choppa knock off yo thighs
La-la-la-la-la-la-la take off I'll shoot off yo tires
Me an my clique be posted up on the block
wuts yo sign (get em up)
but back to the subject of how these haters wish me death
I peeped the way these niggas try to play me to the left
So I keep the "K" off in the trunk
I'm heated when I step
cause beefin ain't beefin until you stop somebody breath
And if we creepin I'm creepin bustin til it ain't nuthin left
If we creepin I'm creepin bustin til it ain't nuthin left
like dat

[Break 2x]
Do something
do something
do something
nigga do something
Do something
do something
do something
nigga do something

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I remember one Sunday we hit the scene it was packed
sittin on 22's wit the paint wet black
Me an my nigga he got my back I got his back
Dem hoes standing on top of the car shakin cat
We finna do a show so we pull the truck to the back
But when I hit the door them niggas ain't know how to act
Dem hoes grabbin on my chain, pullin on my plaits
Dey want me to take em home and hit em from the back
But when we got outside them pussy niggas was hatin
actin like he wanna do me something but he fakin
I asked him wut it was wit no fuckin hesitation
one false move I'ma leave you shakin on the pavement
I had a funny feeling that something was going on
nigga wanna do me something cause I'm ridin on chrome
I had a funny feeling that something was going on
nigga wanna do me something cause I'm ridin on chrome

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
