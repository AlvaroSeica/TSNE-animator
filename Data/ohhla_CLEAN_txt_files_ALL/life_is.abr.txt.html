[Verse 1]
My brain has the aim of deranged insane gangs
Who maintain their fame with their name
I'm just playin
I wake up feelin like a cartoon
I can do anything, except drive a car, true
Then I start to have some orange juice
Take vitamins; I don't wanna catch the bird flu
Is it hard to make your own heart swoon?
Life is a free throw, nobody guards you

[Chorus]
Life is a free throw
And I tell them all the same
It isn't a game
Ain't nobody standin in your way
Life is a free throw
And you ain't really gotta search for what you deserve
Long as you work, you're gonna earn
Life is a free throw
Every time I turn around somebody's throwin a pound
The value's going down
Life is a free throw
But I don't let it bother me
I keep movin' logically
Ain't nobody stopping me
Life is a free throw

[Verse 2]
I do some dishes, wash forks &amp; spoons -
Go mess around with guitar loops
I think I'm a start to make some art soon
Feelin sharp as a shark's tooth or a harpoon
I could make a flower bloom in a dark room
I'm a leave the beat with all of its parts strewn all across the cemetery
Buried in a marked tomb
Now you think that I'm some bizarre loon
Like I'm rhymin with no fun, "Dark doom
You never heard or observed such dark gloom"
I'm a dance around like Marky Mark
"Dude, uh, you should do some sit-ups"
Ok, I'm a start to
I hit the gym dressed all in maroon
I see a girl sprayin on some perfume
Made me light-headed like I inhaled some car fumes
I said, "I'm free later on tonight, are you?"

[Chorus]
Life is a free throw
And I tell them all the same
It isn't a game
Ain't nobody standin in your way
Life is a free throw
And you ain't really gotta search for what you deserve
Long as you work, you're gonna earn
Life is a free throw
Every time I turn around somebody's throwin a pound
The value's going down
Life is a free throw
But I don't let it bother me
I keep movin' logically
Ain't nobody stopping me
Life is a free throw

[Verse 3]
So we go sit down on some bar stools
Tryin to be cool but it's kinda hard to
I don't golf but this girl is a par two
She got bounce just like a kangaroo
We start chattin bout bar food
Turns out she's really hungry for some waffles
Outside there's a guy who's sellin some falafels
She ate five and started to feel awful
She said, "I need a bed and a novel"
I said, "Where's your place? I could walk you."
She said, "I live downtown in a brothel.
You bought me that food so I owe you a cuddle."
I said, "No you smell like a puddle."
It didn't make sense but I was befuddled
I couldn't be subtle
I broke out on the double
Back to my crib
That's how I live, no struggle

[Chorus]
Life is a free throw
And I tell them all the same
It isn't a game
Ain't nobody standin in your way
Life is a free throw
And you ain't really gotta search for what you deserve
Long as you work, you're gonna earn
Life is a free throw
Every time I turn around somebody's throwin a pound
The value's going down
Life is a free throw
But I don't let it bother me
I keep movin' logically
Ain't nobody stopping me
Life is a free throw</pre>
