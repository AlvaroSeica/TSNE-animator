[Chorus]
You know it's Tonedeff &amp; PackFM
Came through to bomb the nation
Don't Fall for imitations or rhyming abominations
We're sorry we kept you waiting
But glad you had the patience
Cause it's worth it for (A Good Combination)

[V1 - PACK FM]
We're like Boom-Bap and BackPacks, Krylon and fat caps
Thug cats that pack gats, BMI and ASCAP
Now where the fuck my cash at?? Dow Jones and NASDAQ
Bad luck and black cats, Bad guys and black hats

[V1B - TONEDEFF]
Like Cupid to card stores, Lucas to Star Wars,
Han &amp; Chewbacca, and Kaufman to Latka, Breakers moving on cardboard
Cartman &amp; candy, markers and tagged streets, Marvel &amp; Stan Lee
Carson, McMann, even Austin Powers &amp; Bad Teeth

[V1C - PACK FM]
Nah we're like Fred and Daphne, Velma Shaggy and Scooby
Cole slaw, Mashed potatos and a biscuit with your 2 piece
Popcorn and movies, MC's and loose leaf
Headwraps and Couffies, Woodstock and Snoopy

[V1D - TONEDEFF]
Like Rick Baker to Poncho, we that unlimited combo
Like skinny women and Cosmo, Chickens &amp; Gonzo
Diggin &amp; Fossils, Syphilis and brothels, Bitches &amp; Thongs go
Hand in hand like Scalpers and Tickets to Rock Shows

[V1E - PACK FM]
We be the head honchos, We got hoes in the whip giving hot dome
On the way to Roscoes Chicken and Waffles
We got mad cheddar, stayin dipped like nachos
You can't afford a ride, you just go around takin pictures at car shows
I don't even know her *why she in the car tho*
*Pack you got some 'splaining to do* ... Like Ricky Ricardo
Fuck it, in today out tomorrow
Movin mad units out the store, like puttin ducktape over the barcodes

[V1F - TONEDEFF]
Don't let me catch my lines caught on ya teeth
Honestly, I'm at war with these pussies, rocking a condom and army fatigues

I Knew something was fishy, when your girl's all out her jeans
Bothering me, rockin a flowerprint padded bra on her knees
Pardon me, please.I'm fuckin silly with barbs over beats
You know your ass never bargained for T, nigga, Toss your receipts
Kids never admit to an honest defeat
So, I walk with a hidden camera to serve you, so I can send you a copy for free

[Chorus]

[V2A - TONEDEFF]
We come together like 5 lions forming the voltron
Holmes &amp; Watson, Doors &amp; Knobs and Holes &amp; Cocks and Hotels post prom
Silent Bob &amp; Jay, Tylenol and aches,
Willis &amp; Arnold, Alyssa Milano with...none of her clothes on

[V2B - PACK FM]
Burt and Ernie, Robin and Bat Man, Lavern and Shirley
Moe Larry and Curly, Jake and the Fat Man
A bag of chips and soda pop, Quark Xpress and Photoshop
Decepticons and Autobots, *Rock On* and ya don't stop!

[V2C - TONEDEFF]
Pokey &amp; Gumby, Mulder &amp; Scully, in charge like Charles &amp; Buddy,
Heckle &amp; Jeckle to Sideshow Bob &amp; Krusty
Rhymes &amp; Drum Beats, Mathau &amp; Lemon when they was old &amp; grumpy
Pacino, Deniro, Mr. Flava Flav &amp; Chuck D

[V2D - PACK FM]
Sagat and Bison vs. Ryu and Ken
*street fighter sounds*
And just in case by now you haven't figured it out
Ya girls favorite combo, is my dick in her mouth

[V2E - TONEDEFF]
Fred &amp; Barney, Gleason &amp; Carnie
Jack, Chrissy &amp; Janet, or Pee-Wee &amp; Jambi
Ravers to X, Las Vegas to bets, onto virgins and locked knees
Kirk &amp; Spock with a starfleet, Apollo &amp; Rocky, to Xerox and copies

[Chorus]

[V3A - TONEDEFF]
Incentive.Pack &amp; Tonedeff, back up off us
Inventive.Got our own branch at the patent office
The Famm is extended, highly recommended
On record, second only to red when it comes to rockin with method
Man, I'm bringin the pain, come fill in the blanks/ (shit is deranged)
Overcast shows, then kick you out with an umbrella for you to go sing in the rain
Go listen anything else you were playing, go bet if it isn't the same
We're still in the ranks! They got you gassed, but we got 'em spillin their tanks
(Tone, you're killing it) .Thanks

[V3B - PACK FM]
We come sharper than a ginsu, *Even slices through a thin shoe*
Hit you in the grill with more combos than a value menu
The tag team specialist, my Plague fam extension is
Sending a fuck you with a smile, I hope you share the sentiments
So when you know its me, Better run like cheap hosiery
Efamm and The Plague, I roll with more clicks than a rotary
So now we back in this bitch, yall makin me sick
48 inches of wax - my track record's as long as my dick!
