[Intro: Myalansky]
Can't give up, It's like that man
I'm saying man, I thought it was all good man
I thought you was a soldier and shit
Just catch a little case, Then you start
Then you start leaking and shit
What the fuck is going on man

[Myalansky]
Target since a juvenile, They tried to screw me in trial
To walk the mile, Thought they knew my style
Feds said I fuck with Jamaicans'
Prospect Expressway and Ocean Ave, The found nathan
You know I never rat Kerry
Got me peeking out my window cause Printo was leaking info
Thought Nicky was a soldier but he folded
That shit pussy, Still don't believe he told son
The whole shit feel apart once they bagged Apache
Kerry was your pappy, Pussy, You some mad niggas
Thought yall faggots how to flex
Snatch'n the rep, You birthed clones in the projects
Rocking platinum before niggas, Nah no disrespect
I'm talking true to life drug dealers
Traced back to early eighties, Ten years after Pearly made me
Life in the street became the world that raised me
Half a million sold on the swarm, Dropped the single
Where was Heaven, And brought you half of the puzzle
Pour this in your glass and guzzle it, Bitch
Convict me by twelve or carry me by six
But I aint playing snitch, Twelve or six

[Chorus: Myalansky]
It takes twelve to convict me, Six to kiss me
Then place me underneath the Earth and call me history
Transport to penitentiary for a century
It's like a Masonry curse on the Kennedy's
I chose affiliated with crimes and never I will be played a snitch
Twelve or six

[Joe Mafia]
Ayo, How the fuck you get home
How the fuck you get locked up, Come back home and get right back on
Niggas cheated when emotion get pinned
Straight ratting on fam like it don't mean shit
Goddamn, Niggas ride around all day and they care free
Like it don't mean nothing it's stunt'n to scare me
Gotta watch who I serve, They re-estating indictments
Dirty with coke and a pistol, Threw me in Riker's
Stashing at my baby Mom's crib, It aint safe no more
Death to a snitch in two thousand and five
But if only yall new young niggas stay the fuck out my way
Cause I don't know what's going on ya heard me
Before I have to body one of you I'll stay to myself
Know the town's big enough, I aint share'n my wealth
Get yours and keep your boys over there with you
Cause on the real aint nobody ratting but you
Police ass nigga, Diplomat dicks with work
Knocking off good niggas you get what you deserve
I got cats doing kingpin time, Fuck all you Benedict
Niggas in the bricks that pinch, Yall aint shit
I don't rock nothing, And I don't know where to get it at
Front'n like it's good and gravey, Make me twist your cap
Co-D's wooh-dee, Riding, Surviving
Names ringing in the regional with Saint Choirs
Motherfuckers in the hood straight rocking wires
Fires, Suppliers, The block's tired
The game aint a game no more, Hit reveals squeal
Federalos on the constant, Direct marked bills
Fuck chill, Niggas wanna see me in the box
So I'ma keep bang'n til they lay in the box

[Chorus]</pre>
