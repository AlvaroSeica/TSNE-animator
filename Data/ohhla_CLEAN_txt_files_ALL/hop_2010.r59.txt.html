[Royce Da 5'9"]
{C'mon!} I smoke good like a Rasta mon
All around me I'm on point like a octogon
I'm the optimum
I'ma be eatin until my belly stick out as far as the Octo-mom's
I'm an abomination
I'm an anomaly in conversation, I'm honorin confrontation
With a dime doin dominatrix on her
Disrespect me I'll wet you like condensation
Water (water) I'm a mixture
between Chris Brown and Chris Jericho, where's your daughter?
... I'm more than y'all can handle
At the Grammy's I'll send an Indian girl to the podium
to say "No thank you" like, Marlon Brando
The Oscars, "The Godfather"
Our father, you should praise me
I got some syphilis nunchucks wearin a AIDS key
That mean I'm sick when I kick SHIT!
Come to my concert get some SARS on the tip of your TIC-KET!
Hehe... I'm super cold
I don't spit, I shit, on your whole team
These niggaz think I'm from Cleveland
It's somethin the way I be, droppin the Browns off at the Superbowl
Game time, nigga let's hit the sto'
And if I gave a FUCK, this is where the hook would go
This is Street Hop, no rules
The rest of y'all niggaz watered down like old dudes
I'm willin to do what you won't do, I'm old school
I'm a mac, I punch rappers cause I'm +Pro-Tools+
I hit your Pause button, I cease frontin
You don't start nothin, it still might be somethin
You don't want nothin, you might have somethin
If I go over your head it's cause your ass duckin
FUCK the underground
I rhyme for them fly motherfuckers that's up, that ain't tryin to dumb it down
FUCK radio, FUCK video
I live by the Bust' +Scenario+, what the dealio?
You could stop listenin, right now
I'm pussy eatin with bitches, I put the dyke down
Cause I'm a diamond, I'm llama rhymin, you Ramadan-in
Simon says that in my prime I'm here
Everywhere I go it's a crime there
While you on-lookin at me in the lawn chair
Cocaine (cocaine) propane (propane)
I'm a livin degenerate of the dope game
Relate to it Â– though you thought you probably couldn't
put a face to the opposite of how the FAKE do it
I'm hip-hop's savior, the old faithful
Sick shit, stop you off that liquid like brake fluid
This is Street Hop (Street Hop)</pre>
