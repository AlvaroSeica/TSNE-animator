[Santigold]
Got no need for the fancy things
All the attention that it brings
Tell me no, I say yes, I was chosen
And I will deliver the explosion
Can't say it's gonna get me far
Do no good to say what you are
I run the streets and I break up houses
River runs deep and the flame devours it

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Me I'm a creator, thrill is to make it up
The rules I break got me a place up on the radar
Me I'm a taker, know what the stakes are
Can't roll it back, it's understood, got to play our cards

[Santigold]
Sit tight I know what you are
Mad bright, but you ain't no star
Polish up 'til you make it gleam
Your M.O., I know what you mean
Tailridin and I know it's true
While they screamin "I love you"
Down deep you know there ain't no flow
A soul decay was D.O.A. yeah
I know what you here for now
Word's out, you're an ideal whore now
Now don't you crush on me
I'll see you in yo' pipe dreams
Whether or not you know it's true
You are who they dictate to
That shit must hurt real bad
Fakin what you wish you had

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
Here all the folks come ask about me
Bandwagon, but they used to doubt me
Blindside tend to hit real hard
You should heed the warning and get a bodyguard
Steady friction in this bitch
Creepin in just like an itch
So far, I got the last laugh
Still the rich rise up, still I live fast
Wouldn't know it face to face
Got no soul and got no taste
Movin in, speed up the pace
I got it locked though, what a waste
All the talk is standard fare
Walk the walk if it gets you there
On the grind 'til the gig is up
I'll smash 'em down, put a muzzle on them like WHAT?

[Chorus]</pre>
