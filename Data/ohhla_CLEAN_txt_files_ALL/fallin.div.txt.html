Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Aw, shit I got her number now!
I call it, I think I love her now
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin'! [x2]

Ah, I think I love her now!
She make my mother proud
Cloud 9 and I ain't coming down
Real booty like this, don't come around!
Look into your eyes through your Dior frames
Let's flow high like when we board planes
My boys look at me all strange
They like what this nigga like on?
Up late night staring at your icon
Photo on your blog site pondering the thought like
I'm the one, your type baby i could be your icon
Shit, baby I could be your Sidekick
You could be my main thing
I think you're the right fit

[Chorus]
Aw, shit I got her number now!
I call it, I think I love her now
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin'! [x2]

I'm about to call her up
She's so gorgeous
that ass is so enormous
I promise I won't fall in love
With the pussy, wine and a little bit of time is all it took me
Now I'm knee-deep in it so much I could sleep in it
So good, I think I might skeet skeet in it!
Aw, shit, there goes my conscious
I get this picture in my head, of me fallin
She got me calling, fuck it I did!
Babe, you left your lip gloss back at my crib
I'm at the studio now, be back at ten
She's right on time, we back at it again (like)

[Chorus]
Ah, shit I got her number now!
I call it, I think I love her now
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin'! [x2]

I'd love to take you down on your lunch break
Hit the fallopian, your ex is a crumb cake
He's Nickelodeon, you know I'm on my main shit
Up at the podium you always give the brain right
Call you Smithsonian, we're homies and we're intimate
How she get me in the mix, track star backyard
Cake like intimate, smoking like an Indian
You're raised off Phillipians
You know it's real when she makes sure the rent is in
Yeah! At first I'd rather be a nigger
Time goes fast and our vibes move quicker
Couldn't wait awhile, kinda crazy
How I grew with ya? With the world fend to do with us
I think I'm...

[Chorus]
Aw, shit I got her number now!
I call it, I think I love her now
I'm fallin', fallin', fallin'! [x2]</pre>
