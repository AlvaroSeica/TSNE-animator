[Verse 1]
Fuck the bullshit, beat that ass to the flo'
He twistin' and he shakin' like a got damn ho
don't run or bat me, always tryin' to attack me
destroy your brain cells, from the heads I be clappin'
I'll buck all day, I'll buck all night
damn right I beat ya ass, in the got damn fight
don't stand so close, getcha damn nose broke
tryna gimme dap when you see me, bitch you ain't my folk

come and switch ya sidewayz, I'ma ???
thug straight trappin, 'til I get rich off this rappin
I ain't got no friends, gotta watch who's heads I be snappin?

spit pimpin on a real bitch, just to get brain
what the fuck is you tryin me for
I ain't no bitch, I ain't no lame ho

[Chorus]

[verse 2]
what the fuck is goin on
I beat the fuck out ya ass, and run ya bitch ass home
I'ma young thug nigga, I ain't no fuckin joke
if I ain't no lame nigga, what the fuck you eyein' for
talkin all that shit, bitch take it outside
pop ya bout 3 times, now ya turn clockwise
I ain't playin, I done been tried
damn near took a life, used to call me chuckie
cuz I stabbed a man wit a knife, my life
tatted on my neck, so you best respect
we thug stylin BME, leavin hoes pussy wet
all our ?? niggaz ball, I don't thank no bitch
I gotta hoe in the car, that'll get up in this shit
I'm gone and pissed off, my brains and nerve lost
I carry my own coffee, you spill you get tossed
and last but not least, bitch quit tryin me
you ain't got no business mothafuckin eyein me

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3]
Hataz dress to impress, but they missed a spot
it takes chest to distress the longevity pot
but I gotta 380 ready, keep ya eyes up off me
keep ya eyes off my dick, and get ya own damn money
you bony mothafucka getcha head split right open
I do it in the street, and leave ya neighborhood spoken
and they hopin that the mothafuckin war is over
these lyrics so diverse that a click-clack and break ya shoulder
I done rolled up on the southside of the 'A'
if you keep lookin, I'ma bust ya ass in the face
I ain't gon bless, I'ma just make an example
all that unloyal shit, gon getcha fuck ass ???
when I cock back, my piece is gonna sound like BAM
hit ya ass so hard, the fuckin crowd say damn
"You just got knocked the fuck out"
that's the way we do niggaz that be eyein in the south

[Chorus]</pre>
