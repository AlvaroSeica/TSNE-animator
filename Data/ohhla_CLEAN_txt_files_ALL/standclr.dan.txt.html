[KORRY DEEZ]
Yo, nod your neck as the record gets so mean
That every head detects that I'm in effect like codeine
We bring hip-hop to life where there's no scene
Our show seems to convert rap culture into D.N.A. protein
You only spread our name when you create rumours
We consider you late bloomers cuz your crew couldn't relate sooner
You want some help? Well, here's a hand out:
Your formula's bitten, see while you trying to fit in, we trying to stand out
The songs you make are almost real so fake harder
I see red but these blood suckers ain't dead so push the stake farther
Our verses hit so hard, they break armor
Spot the wicked then move away with the reflexes of a snake charmer

[DAN-E-O]
Yeah, we strapped with them phatter tracks, chat that my pack is wack
My crew, especially that Black Cat ain't having that
Stacked with more fire than an Afghani gat attack
So repeat offenders can't come back with a badder rap!
Cover your eyes, guard your grill and block your tummy
Or get left crooked like a cop with extra pocket money
A taser couldn't stun me, but what really provokes
Is this industry is still taking Monolith for jokes
We pound like an athlete's heart before he races
To grand slam this business in hopes to clean up its basis
Cuz every time you chop us down, we grow back bigger
Go figure, now Run Tell Dat nigga!

[CHORUS]
Trust me, we ain't going nowhere
You thought my crew wouldn't be here
We real sick with the mic, we still ripping it right
We crush clicks with this tight flow, fo' sho'
So you best to stand clear!
Trust me, we ain't going nowhere
You thought my crew still gon' be here
We real sick with the mic, we still ripping it right
We crush clicks with this tight flow, fo' sho'
So you best to stand clear!
Trust me, we ain't going nowhere

[BLACK CAT]
(forgive me God)
I make you scream the Lord's name in vain
Spittin' rhymes in your ear to make you pop a blood vessel in your brain
I'm hotter than a kettle on flame, way ahead of the game
Niggaz ain't ready for these levels of pain
I'm sickening like sixteen clit rings ready to rip things
Setting up big things, think you're fly? I clipped wings!
Rip dudes, flip dudes who think they're testin'
But they're gifts get ripped open quicker than Christmas presents
Niggaz don't wanna start messin' with a seasoned veteran
Who could spit a verse and leave a whole species threatened
Use complete discretion when niggaz reach in the session
We tear functions, leave your ears thumpin', Wio tear somethin'!

[WIO-K]
Yeah, Dan and Irs, I got a plan to burst
Let's jam the earths until they understand we're first
Yo, some man will curse upon the dead, tell you they're true
Well you can see right through the lie and wonder why they tried with you dude
Payback's a slut bitch and it's real
Like bunnin' weed around foreigners you can't feel
You style bitin'! I smile while writing
You bullshit until it gets hit by wild lightning
The good grace kept a few men by your back
It's them same man you want to move on and talk your crap
Now why is that? They want know it's cool, cuz Wio's phat
Man'll go the extra mile to see we out lying flat!
Yeah!

[CHORUS]
Trust me, we ain't going nowhere
You thought my crew wouldn't be here
We real sick with the mic, we still ripping it right
We crush clicks with this tight flow, fo' sho'
So you best to stand clear!
Trust me, we ain't going nowhere
You thought my crew still gon' be here
We real sick with the mic, we still ripping it right
We crush clicks with this tight flow, fo' sho'
So you best to stand clear!
Trust me, we ain't going nowhere</pre>
