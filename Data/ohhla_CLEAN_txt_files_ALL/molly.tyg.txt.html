[Intro: sample of Cedric Garvais' "Molly"]
"Hi, I am looking for Molly... I've been searching everywhere
And I can't seem to find Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly"

[Tyga]
AUGHH~! Bands all in my dollars (dollars), I'm everywhere it's poppin' (poppin')
Can't fall in love I got options (options), I'm high school that's college (college)
King Gold Chains, that's Notre Dame; that green, yeah I got it (got it)
I show up in the party (party) like where the fuck that molly (WOO!)
O-D we're O-G's, we don't fuck with no police
I'm too fly to be low key, them 24 inch Kobes
All black that's Jodeci, she gimme +Pussy+ that's Josie
Broke niggas stop beggin' me cause that's the shit that I don't need
I'm swervin' (swervin'), I'm drivin' (drivin'), ain't got time to be tired (tired)
I'm super turnt, don't try me; killin' yo mind off and fuckin' yo body
Bitch wanna flick, pose for my posse, got too much shit to worry about gossip
I'm on a bad trip... AUGHH~!

[Chorus One: sample of "Cedric Garvais' "Molly"]
And I can't seem to find Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (Fucked around and fell in love with her)
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (Fucked around and fell in love with her) {*2X*}
... (Fucked around and fell in love with her)

[Wiz Khalifa]
Hahahahahah... uhh
Lil' bitch, my section is important ('portant), my new car's imported ('portant)
My bank account is enormous ('nourmous), weed so loud it's distorted ('torted)
Got champagne and we pourin' it (pourin' it), she poppin' it and she snortin' it (snortin' it)
My iPhone recordin' it (recordin' it), if I want it, I can afford it
Bitch I'm Young Khalifa (Young Khalifa), fillin' my lungs with reefer (lungs with reefer)
Somewhere in the clouds (clouds), gotta press up to see us (up to see us)
I gotta whip so fast that I caught a ticket speedin'
And my bitch so bad that I'm never ever cheatin'
I might pull up in some shit that you've never ever seen
And if I said how much I made, then you won't even believe it
Me and T-Y gettin' gnarly when we pull up to the party
Brought a whole pound of Mary... uhh, uhh, hahahahah
...I'm high as fuck, heheheheh

[Chorus Two: sample of Cedric Garvais' "Molly"]
And I can't seem to find Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (Fucked around and fell in love with her)
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (Fucked around and fell in love with her) {*2X*}
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (Fucked around and fell in love with her)

[Mally Mall]
Put it in my drink (drink), p-put it in my drink (drink)
Put it in my drink (drink), {you already know, know}
Put it in my drink (drink), p-put it in my drink (drink)
Put it in my drink (drink), {you already know, know}
... She had me smokin'
Had me smokin' - s-s-smokin' on my reefer
{... She had me smokin'}
{Had me smokin' - s-s-smokin' on my reefer}
