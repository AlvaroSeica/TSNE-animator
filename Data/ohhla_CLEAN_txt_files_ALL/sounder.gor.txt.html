[Life]
You couldn't escape this music even if your name's Houdini
Our tracks say Lah for Life and don't disappear like a genie
Communicating through your airwaves like a giant C.B.
'cause this one's for your radios or whether you recieve me
Our music is so hot, it feels like the sun in Tahiti
We rickety-rock, Gorillaz style is buck wild, believe me
We heavyweights who phase ya like Ali did with Frasier
We spit the most flava but musically, we'll amaze ya
We've been blessed and we've been gifted like Jesus in his manger
Won't you shout 'Hallelujah!' Here comes your music saviour
From your heart to your mind, your spirits to your souls,
we've come to take control with the Gorillaz on patrol
See, our rhymes possess the powers of a superhero
Supernaturally we rock the mic but wit' a natural flow
If you didn't know before, you know now - We told you so
Gorillaz rock your dome just like the one in Tokyo

[2-D]
It's a hard dream to contemplate
I could fall into the abyss-ah
And I love this interlude
It's the reason to deliver
And they called onto me
Says they came to talk to me though
The more of us that lies,
I guess the kids don't live or die

[Si Phili]
'Cause we're makin' this music that's making you lose it
so people don't abuse it and there ain't no way for you to refuse it
Gorillaz be the army that's startin' this pardy-ardy
Makin' more noise than carnivals mixed with the Mardi-Gradi
We're comin' through your town with the sound that's so profound
Gorillaz with the rappers that straight from the underground
We're tearin' it down, makin' you feel this sort of force
Knockin' you to your senses and knockin' you off your course
'cause we're the source, got you feeling that's so appealing
We got you jumpin' around and bouncin' off of the ceiling
Makin' music ya feeling from Baltimore into Bristol
I know you're hearin' me 'cause my voice is clearer than crystal
The casual, supernatural flows I be exposin',
makin' sure that you're frozen and makin' sure that I'm chosen
to rip a score, makin' you damage the dance floor
Gorillaz and Phi Life'll give you what you ask for

[2-D]
It's a hard dream to contemplate
I could fall into the abyss-ah
And I love this interlude
It's the reason to deliver
And they called onto me
Says they came to talk to me though
The more of us that lies,
I guess the kids don't live or die

Let Gorillaz be your guiding light and your shining star,
whether you be home alone or drivin' in your car
	Don't matter who ya are, whether you be near or far,
	you'll be feelin' entertained be our music repertoire
See, our poems, they be flowin' like rivers and resevoirs
'cause Gorllaz, we be out of this world like men of Mars
	We rap stars with supernatural spars
	We leave your brains amazed with this super music of ours
So put your hands up and stand up - It's time to get down
'cause Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round
	From the right to the left, from the skies to the ground
	We're coverin' all angles and you can't escape the sound
On the track, it's laid back - We've come to spray raps
Keep it chilled and relaxed but we still sound phat
	It's like that when we write raps
	We're not from the Empire but we still Strike Back!
