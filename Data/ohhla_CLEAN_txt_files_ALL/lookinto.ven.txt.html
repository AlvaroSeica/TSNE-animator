[N-Tyce]
Will times ever change? Nah, they only re-arrange
Things still remain, weight, heavy on the brain
Though I'm goin insane, I can't loose control
Cruise control, next tragic hit, who's to know?
Crack killing babies, niggas holdin on to 380's
Yellin out, nobody can fade me, forget me not
Baby on the come and get me plot
Sometimes I wonder how can this be stopped
Playin Russian roulette, no protection, love, in the sex
Ain't no telling what disease they be comin' with next
We gotta conquer all the nonsense
Too many folks out livin' they life without a conscience
Ain't caring, wanna fight a nigga just for staring
Kids shooting up schools cuz somebody dared 'em
United we live, divided we fall, take a look into my eyes you can see it all
 
[Chorus: Taunja]
Look into my eyes and see
Look into my eyes and see
If you look into my eyes
Nah naaaa nah nah, nah naaa nah nah
 
[J-Boo]
It all started when we came across the water in chains
There's no change, we still a generation of pain
Little kids dying, while our mothers are steady crying
But what about the girl from the hood, who steady trying
High school grad attends college next fall
Plane ticket out of state, USC where she ball
Future draft pick for the WNBA
But her dreams all ended on that terrible day
Little Nicky, the only child her mother had
She got caught in a cross fire of a deal gone bad
Now we have tournaments on the block to honor her name
With ribbons on our jerseys to remember her pain
Number 13, now retired in the hall of fame
It's the number that I still wear in all of my games
Its insane, the way her life had to end
We was like Jordan and Pippen, she was my very best friend
 
[Chorus]
 
[Champ]
I been rapping for many years, in the game, about 8
Lived through three damn straight, but they dont hold weight
But wait, this shit here gonna take the cake
Out of order nonsense, least they give you a break
Plus I'm stressed the fuck out and got a child to feed
Lost my moms, I guess thats why I puff the weed
Just look into my eyes and tell me what do ya see
That I'm black and I'm broke and got a split personality
Sittin' on the edge of the seat, contemplating
Starin' death right in the face, hands are shakin'
Sweatin' all out of my clothes with blood in my nose
Should I end it now, while my eyes are closed?
Feel my head fall back, but is it time to go?
Time to shine, time for me to get that dough
Living the life, fiendin' like a thief in the night
Gettin' me tight, hatin' cuz I'm seeing the light, and it's on
 
[Chorus to fade]
