[Bliss]
Yeh... cold rain... outside
Under some tropical plants is my topical stance
to enhance your craniums

[Verse 1: Bliss]
It's like 5 in the morning, sunrise
Cage full of birds one flies
I'ma tell you I'm beached on the sand where
jeepers creepers with features that span
From head to toe, oh lead to know oh
How to move my lips when I met this (hubba-hubba)
Male with a fee first no money given
Just an ale by the sea surf, go sunny livin' so
Follow me now but don't be a slow poke
I'm in the pool again to let my flow soak
And my tools the pen so I can sew hope
Into these hooligans so dopes know
to reverse their words these chirpin' birds are writin'
It hurts the herds so curse the surge enlighten
Straight off the b-team bench
Oh my good goodness, look what these three clench
Yo it's Bliss N Eso found pulling cars
To listen to echoes down the boulevard
No radio we travel on whispers
I'm two feet old when I unravel my whiskers
So what's this shit their all Skippin' to
Go to check it out but it's nothin' different dude
Gotta come to grips with a grip a few have
But when Bliss write it mix like I hit a new ave
And I'm back to the paddock and I don't stop man
Call me an addict, well I know I am
After what doesn't make your sound a trend
It's the business takin me around the bend
The way the rims go windows sink and breathe
The wind blow, in flow Indonesia
Thinkin you're pimpin you just clog the creek
You shelve yourself when you turn obsolete, like that

[Chorus: Bliss] {X2}
Ring around the rosies
Pocket full of poetry that got you in the mood
Could ya, would ya love me if the other pocket
had nothing else but love to prove

[Verse 2: Eso]
I'm runnin through the field, free as a bird
And free lets see well that's me as a word
I roll with knowledge, I don't stroll I frolick
I piss in the devils face when I hold my bollocks
Can you picture me chillin' on the sun or moon
using the galaxy as my rumpus room
Didn't know mother nature had a rump that's cute
If your neighbours can't hear this better bump the tune
This is somethin' new, you can spread your wings to it
Swing to it I'ma show you how the kings do it
Unity between you and me, sing to it
A blank piece of paper watch what I bring to it
Love, which will encourage your next visit
Mud, I'm a poetical sex wizard
Run, there's no doubt it's explicit
you've gotta get up to get down and get with it
Fuck reminiscing I'ma tell you 'bout my future
Me with some kids, chillin' with some buddah
And like the pictures in the book I'll be livin' in the bush
mother nature with my kids we'll be giving them a push
And I'ma rest my feet in the kings bed where the queen gets her sleep
The only way that it's meant to be
I hope my woman and my young get the best of me
Cos I need a little love man, I need a little trust
I need a little bud man, I need a little us
Sometimes I need a little bit of rain
just to take a little edge off the pain
Use my love (ha) to kill the blues
You got me thinkin' ferris wheels weren't built for two
Remember no one can fill your shoe
Read between the lines when I tilt the view
See me and the music, we misbehave
Sippin on cold drinks while we sit in the shade
Never ever dream to give it away
We tell stories to each other like we live in a cage
I get harsh, leave cowards in the wasteland
Put down your gun, the powers in the statement
We're the early birds spending hours in the basement
Bliss N Esoterikizm *flowers in the pavement* (grow)

[Chorus: Bliss] {X2}</pre>
