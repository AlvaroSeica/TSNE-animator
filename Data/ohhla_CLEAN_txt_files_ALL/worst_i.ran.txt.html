Song:   Worst I Ever Heard (Drake Remix)
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Random]
You know, a lot of rappers, rap about rappers
And, a lot of cats think these songs are about them
but uhh, don' get confused - this for you

[Chorus: Random]
Homey you is real weak, I don't think you ever wanted
a rap career, so don't spend no cheddar on it
Think you do it real big, but you are forever frontin
Man I want it real bad, I can put whatever on it
You just bring me down, everytime I'm gettin up
You live wit Mom Dukes but you claim you live it up
Everyday I pray for... you to give it up
Cause I hear the same thing every single time
I say you the freakin worst, you the freakin worst
You the freakin worst, you the freakin worst
You the worst I ever heard, worst I ever heard
Worst I ever heard, I worst ever heard
I say you the freakin worst

[Random]
Ohh, OHH~! Yeah
Yeah, a bunch of rappers with no flow
Heh! A bunch of ballers wit no dough	
They claimin they they best in they town
But then I ask around and, and most brothers don't know
I'm sick of whack dudes, spittin weak verses
Couldn't bring then dogs to a flea circus
Only thing worse than that - is you whack promoters
doin pay to play, slavery is over
Let me get this straight; I bring in all the fans
and you makin all the money? Dude I gotta take a stand
And the only thing worse, than you promoters who do it
is you local-minded rappers who agree to it
And you the same dude hit my mans up for beats
He asked your for funds that's the last time you speak - ha!
That type of mess I can't get down with
Keep takin beats off Soundclick
Cause you the freakin worst

[Chorus]

[Random]
Ohh! Yeah, yeah
I'm just "One Man" baby, I be on that Tank tip
Sharpies on a CD-R, I wish it was a blank disc
I never brag and boast but let's be clear
I done trumped your whole career in just 3 years
I see through you like Pepsi Clear
And you ain't gotta like Big Ran but respect this here
Man, I see you frontin in songs like you a boss
And then you on Twitter sayin you can't wait to get off
It's a recession - nobody's doin great
Cats might give you props need to know that you a fake
I'm a vet, keep the shows poppin like a crack spot
While you on the sidelines, reppin like a mascot
On the block cryin 'bout, what the next cat got
While I'm up in Vegas haters tryin to hit the jackpot
If you from here you can't like what it's become
Crabs in the bucket all fightin over crumbs man
Don't get me wrong, a few of y'all was grindin and shinin
The rest of y'all need to stop rhymin
You so vain you think it's you that I'm talkin 'bout
If the shoe fits, make like Unk, "Walk it Out"

[Chorus]

[Outro: Random]
Yeah man, this ain't no diss song man
I'm just speakin my mind
You offended? My bad
MegaRan.com! Rest in peace DJ AM
Everybody else that's lost their lives in oh-nine
We love y'all, YEAH~!</pre>
