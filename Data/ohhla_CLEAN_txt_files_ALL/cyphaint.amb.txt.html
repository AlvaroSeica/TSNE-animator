[Cruz]
Wit the same steeze and finess
I'm back to speak and bless
preach Jesus - for these three reasons
He's the Way, the Truth, the Life, so please believe Him
and take heed of this Being who keeps my heart beating with breath
deep in my chest - bringing to all of y'all Christian raw rhymes to digest
I'm justa teacher to test, but a student at best
placing my fruitful life on top of my Teacher's desk
Jesus! He's the Genius
I have to confess
He taught me how to eat good
like we should
instead of feeding my flesh
I reflect back on that evening Christ was bleeding to death
as I'm reading the text
that keeps me in check
I'm critiquing the meaning of God's agape Love peeping its depths
following each of His steps
while leading the next legion of reps
equipped to reach and effect
every region with the gospel from the east to the west
cus life with out Christ
is like having a jeep or a lex
with out the keys to inject

[Efrem]
From Bronx to Brixton
Philly to London Piccadilly
This is for 'ood rats and 'ill Billies
and Politicians up on Capitol 'ill
for real we come to share the Word of God no matter how you feel
because nuff 'tings are a shame
in this nation that claims to profess the Lord's name
like how in Universities and in the High Schools
they have ban the Bible and say it's for fools
and yet still chose
to be preachin' all dat speculation
like natural selection
instead of Jesus Resurrection
it takes more faith to believe evolution
coz it's a theroy who's evidence has been disproven
man's philosophies ain't notin but profanity
without no absolutes we only breed immorality
and depravity
anarchy within humanity
GODlessness is the root of all insanity
but GREAT is the mystery of Godliness
God was manifest in the flesh before nuff witnesses
beneath the Cross darwin's wisdom ain't but foolishness
because it can't give us purpose, hope or righteousness
Oh Yes our faith has sure evidence
Jesus rose on the 3rd day like sweet smelling incense
to the deceived He's stench
to those who believe and receive and repent
He is a life-givin fragrence!

[The Ambassador]
We make noise for Jesus like racquet
It's not an act, in fact, it's a habit practiced by Christ fanatics
And while you laugh it's amazing how we have this
Thing you lack it's relationship with the Triune Package
With no slackage, we rap to put Christ on the map kid
Times are drastic, but some are laughin' like it's slapstick
Grasp it, ask if you can hack wrath and its facets
The math is man plus sin equals casket
Added to that is the Revelation where the passage
Says after you die, you're judged then you burn like acid
We're all born in the basket
I know you've fasted
went to church took new members class and passed it
But when the bad news is bitter as winters with Jack Frost
The Good News can shine like diamonds on black cloth
Now back off and shift to Calvary where grace flows
Out of the body of a Savior with manmade holes
Think of the aches yo, think of the face blows, think of the grave clothes
But remember the phrase goes "then He got up" case closed
Let's break down to praise mode yo
Redeemed hip hoppers say ho, "Hooooo!"</pre>
