[Verse One: Jadakiss] (Sample of "A Billi" by Jay-Z)
Uh! Yo! Ain't no antidote and ain't no answer
It's me then cancer Jojo Dancer
You could try to fight it but you won't get a chance to
Download the program or even advance ya
Software I'm about takin you off here
Turn to somethin small into guerilla warfare
Sippin coffee over your death in my lawn chair
Hot meal made by the chef with the long hair
Wherever you could think about goin we goin there
Soon as we touch down you know it's on there
Then spendin the money, like we don't care
And when them boys come last thing you 'gon hear is (RAH!!!)

[Verse Two: Red Cafe] 
It's R!!!! I done sold it all, out a Grey Rover
I got all the connections no layover
Hood diet plan come to my gallery
I serve Coke Zero no calories
Still flippin, bri-dicks olympics
Slangin on the benches, rep, flow vintage
Line 'em up or gun 'em down tell me who next
Still raw even when I practice safe sex
Fall through the spidot they like who he?
They see a nigga in the zone like two three
I had big plans when I left the big house
Bad Boy they done let me up in BIG house

[Chorus: Sample of "A Billi" by Jay-Z] (Red Cafe) (*Sheek Louch)
RAH!!!! I'm ill!!! (I'm ill) I'm ill!!!
(I'm ill) I'm ill!!! (*THIS IS THE REMIX!!!)
RAH!!!! RAH!!!! I'm ill!!!  I'm ill!!!
I'm ill!!! I'm ill!!! (*D-BLOCK!!!!!)
RAH!!!! RAH!!!! MOTHERFUCKER I'M ILL!!!
MOTHERFUCKER I'M ILL!!! MOTHERFUCKER I'M ILL!!!
(*SHAKEDOWN!!!! WHATTUP FAMILY!!!! BAD!!! BOY!!!)
RAH!!!! RAH!!!! I'm ill!!! I'm ill!!! I'm ill!!! I'm ill!!!
RAH!!!! RAH!!!!

[Verse Three: Sheek Louch]
Donnie G, I gotchu son.
I'm ill! Nine milli on a Louie belt
Hands been on the same woman Reggie Bush felt
Donnie, chains go bang, Cirocs on the table
Trees all around me like I'm in Turks and Caico
Cars too foreign and I ain't never been to Maaco
Used to sleep on me, now they study my flow (Sheek LOUCH!)
I'm i-ll, that's how I win vanillas, shades on
Sittin in the +Back+ like I'm Wynton Marsalis
Still play the hood, even though my money grow
Top down, CNN, N.O.R.E. and Capone (Ha ha!) 
I'm ill, no worry if the Lox got a deal
Just getcha lil' money, it might be your last meal
RAHHHHH!!!!!

[Verse Four: Styles P]
Sicker than H1N1 (sick!)
Kill the top 5 rappers, then some
Know it's redrum, when the lead come
The gun's the washer and dryer who want they heads spun?
I only give a fuck when the bread comes (That's it!)
...Street niggas know the repertoire
+Public Enemy+ like Dillinger and Escobar (haha!)
I keep shooters on the roof
Goons on deck with wolves for the resta y'all (all that!)
Make you ill when D-Block calls (D-Block!)
That's a knife goin in, our gun goin off
S-P's hard, they think ALL Y'ALL soft!
WHAT!

[Chorus: Sample of "A Billi" by Jay-Z] (Red Cafe) (*Sheek Louch)
RAH!!!! I'm ill!!! (I'm ill) I'm ill!!! (I'm ill)
I'm ill!!! (*THIS IS THE REMIX!!!)
RAH!!!! RAH!!!! I'm ill!!! (*YEAH!!!)
I'm ill!!! I'm ill!!! I'm ill!!! (*D-BLOCK!!!!!)
RAH!!!! RAH!!!! MOTHERFUCKER I'M ILL!!!
MOTHERFUCKER I'M ILL!!! MOTHERFUCKER I'M ILL!!!
(WHAT ELSE!!!!)
RAH!!!! RAH!!!! I'm ill!!! (STILL GOIN!!!)
I'm ill!!! I'm ill!!! I'm ill!!! (YEAH!) RAH!!!! RAH!!!! </pre>
