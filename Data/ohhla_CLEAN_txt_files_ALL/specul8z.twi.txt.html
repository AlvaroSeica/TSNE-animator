Be where you wanna be, and you're doing what you wanna do

[E-40]
Mob that shit up, bee-yatch!!!

[Voice repeating]
Who cares what they think about you?

[Monoxide Child]
Speculation has it, that I'm the freakiest one
I like to rip off my tongue and spit the black magic
And I'm supposed to be fuckin' some crack addict without a rubber
And already got a baby by her mother?
They say I'm signed by a wizard of sorts
And my momma, she was a banshee who was drowned by the corpse
Say my little brother Jamie, he's dead and in a grave
And that I'm all alone and afraid
And everything I gave has been so underestimated
I been hated by generations for havin' conversations with people who didn't make it
How could I fake it?  I'm a monster, remember me?
The weirdo with the axe from another galaxy
I keep a blender in my kitchen, filled to the brim
With the thug suspicions of me drinkin' it up
And so the fuck, scatter stones get out my Kool-Aid
I'm blastin' away from all you haters, hit me on my two-way

[Hook X4]
You start some bullshit fallin' down (Fallin' down)
I'm ok (I'm ok)

[Jamie Maddrox]
Speculation has it, that I'm a drunk and a drug addict
A shit talker always tryin' to start static
A borderline faggot with long fingernails
Either that or he's a cokehead but I don't think he cares
Speculation has it, that I've already engaged
In sexual fantasies with me and Gwen Stefani
I'm videotapin' in the (????????????)
Speculation is called as the one who gets bone
I can't escape it, mistake it, or fake it out
Look you in the face as if I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
The speculation, you heard that I don't spit on nobody's shit
For no dough, hey man, many mouths to feed and many personalities
In me, lookin' to get P-A-I-D!
Is it lie or is it truth? You can put that on our skills
They stay snug like my Batman suit

[Hook]

[E-40]
We smash the flash and if I have to blast it back, get 'em up, hit 'em up
Speculations, hater-ations, me and Twiztid don't give a fiz-nuck
'Cause we gon' stay gettin' papered up, and stay smashin' indepently
With a dedicated ass fan base that'll do a motherfucker in for me
Speculations, but see they just don't know
I don't be rappin' too fast, they just be listenin' too slow
I don't be spittin' sluggish, E-40 Water be spittin' thug shit
40 be representin' the bowery up in the Compton, got the third hoppin'
Ain't no stoppin' a pimp, me walk with a limp
Elbows on gimp, puffin' on hits, sippin' on sip
Sippin' on sip, dippin' and skatin' and bouncin' and shit
Me and Twiztid be twisted, me and Twiztid be gone
Me and Twiztid be blizted, me and Twiztid be stoned
Gone on our head, dead, dead wrong
Smokin' turtle, beatin' on our chest like King Kong
Conversatin', lickin' and pokin', high powered slangin' of the day
Tryin' to persuade this licker into givin' me brain
