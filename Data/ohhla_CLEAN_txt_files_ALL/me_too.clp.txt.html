You know we back right?, Clear the streets out
Come on with it, Ha ha Star Trak

Listen haters, I'm doing deals like the majors
Ice Cream Sneakers, I signed my first skater
So you can pay three and buy yourself some bapestas
Bulletproof on the t-shirts because they hate us
Dude like Snoop say "Step Ya Game Up"
Double the caboe, mediterrain up
D-Class Action cuts, tuck your chain up
Liberachi fingers, just hit Lorraine up
Just last week, I was out in Aspen
Me and Puff hoppin off the plane, both us laughing
A week before that, I was out in Italy
Attire heart throbs could not get rid of me
Up and down the tella crib, me and like ten hoes
Call from the cell phone, give me that enzo
I know what your thinking, yeah me too
Okay everybody meet mister me too

[Pusha T]
Been two years, like I was paddy wagon cruisin
The streets was yours, ya dunce cappin and cazooin
I was just assuming you'd keep the coke movin
But I got one question, Fuck y'all been doing?
Pyrex Turs turned into Covalli furs
The full length cat, when I wave, the kitty purs
All my niggaz caped up, selling grey and beige dust
Had that money right or end up in the trunk taped up
We don't chase a duck, we only raise the bucks
Peel money rolls until our thumbs get the papercuts
Children totto, South Beach Galardo
Teals started up, go brr like it's Nardo
Women if you love me, please let me know
Tie rags round your neck and learn the sets we throw
These are the days of our lifes
And I'm sorry to the fans but the crackers weren't playing fair Jive
I know, I know, yep yeah, you too
Okay we get it, yep yeah you too
I know, I know, yep yeah, you too
Okay everybody meet mister me too
I know, I know, yep yeah, you too
Okay we get it, yep yeah you too
I know, I know, yep yeah, you too
Okay everybody meet mister me too

[Pharrell]
I know what you thinkin why I call you me too
Cause everything I say, I got you sayin me too
I say I got a benz so you said me too
You hangin out the window so they can see you
But you ain't hangin out the window when you in that G2
Or that G3 or G4 like we do
Star Trak, clipse come on

[Malice]
Wanna know the time? Better clock us
Niggaz bite the style from the shoes to the watches
We cloud hoppers, tailor suits like we mobstas
Break down keys into dimes and sell 'em like gobstoppers
Who gonna stop us? Not a god damn one of ya
Mean with the Re-Up, nigga we street tumblers
Ivory White, yeah that's the same color
Of the Zord the, best believe it's the mullenor
Take no prisoners, rap niggaz are whisperers
Choke on your own spit just as soon as you mention us
Champagne corkes, kicked by Louis sportsin
Keep my hoes in pooch and Charles Jordan
Cop the chrome and touch grey caponent
Mink on the floor, make ya hot don't it?
You don't wanna know what the fuck I spent on it
Tomorrow ain't promised so we live for the moment

[Pusha T]
I know, I know, yep yeah, you too
Okay we get it, yep yeah you too
I know, I know, yep yeah, you too
Okay everybody meet mister me too
I know, I know, yep yeah, you too
Okay we get it, yep yeah you too
I know, I know, yep yeah, you too
Okay everybody meet mister me too</pre>
