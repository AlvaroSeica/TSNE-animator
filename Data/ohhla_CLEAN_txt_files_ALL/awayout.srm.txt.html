[Intro: Erick Sermon]
Ummm! Ummm! Yes! Ummm!
Uh huh! Ummm! There must be a way uh! 
Ah! Yeah! There gotta ne a way uh!

[Chorus: Jimmy Hendrix]
There must be some kind of way outta here (Find it!)
There must be some kind of way outta here (Hmmm!)

[Verse One: Erick Sermon] (*Jimmy Hendrix)
Ha! Damn! My heart is goin bad (Uh huh!)
Gotta get home 'cause my kids need dad
Got me on Worldstar now I'm on Vlad (UH!)
Media throwin me in the Pitt like Brad
Can't get mad, it works both ways
So I'm sad plus glad, forgot what I had (HA!)
Rad, white boys definition of cool
Me behind the 8ball defintion for pool
Rick Ross seizure Heavy D the breather
Now I'm all hooked up monitor with the beeper
IV's in me (UH HUH!) Arm lookin like a heroin addict
Can you feel me Jimmy? (*Here) 
People in prayer on my Facebook and Twitter (HUH!)
Post fam like, don't you leave me nigga!
Are you in Paris 'cause this shit's crazy
Thank God and the sun that saved me

[Chorus: Jimmy Hendrix] (Erick Sermon)
There must be some kind of way outta here (I'm gonna find it yeah I'm gonna find it!)
There must be some kind of way outta here (Yeah I'm goin this way!)
There must be some kind of way outta here (I'm gonna find it yeah I'm gonna find it!)
There must be some kind of way outta here (Oh yeah I'm goin that way!)

[Verse Two: Erick Sermon]
Yeah! I'm blessed 'cause I made it (HUH!)
Now everybody comin at the E now I hate it (YEAH!)
It's not their fault it's the messed I created
It's time to get the fake and the real separated
This almost killed me, so called fame (AH!)
Seein me in the picture date under my name
Shame I live life for everyone but me
The money I worked for they gettin it free
Sayin they love me to death and all that
Sayin I look good lean though I'm fat
Who the hell are these people?! (HUH!) I don't even fit here
Who's bathroom is this man?! I don't even sit here 
Never try to red light me try to scheme
But I was good to go that's why my eyes green
So I'm a get in my new Coupe and rive
And Sway back and forth, Shade 45

[Chorus: Jimmy Hendrix] (Erick Sermon)
There must be some kind of way outta here (I'm gonna find it yeah I'm gonna find it!)
There must be some kind of way outta here (Yeah I'm goin this way!)
There must be some kind of way outta here (I'm gonna find it yeah I'm gonna find it!)
There must be some kind of way outta here (Oh yeah I'm goin that way!)

[Verse Three: Erick Sermon]
Yeah! I heard what you said man
I was almost underground like a dead man
And now I'm writin down sentences, but I could have been where Jimmy Hendrix is
I'm a fighter, somethin like Rocky Balboa
Built this architect and I don't need Noah (Uh HUH!)
Chick callin my name and I don't even know her
But if she want to get to know me now let me show her
Erick! I come from the era of the golden (RHYMES!)
This DMC crown I'm holdin
JMJ helped my group in a big way (UH HUH!)
I wished I could tell him now thanks for my DJ
A few friends I don't speak to often
Some on their high horses came down off them
Just to show me homey that they care
And there's a way out, and I'm gettin the fuck outta here!!!! Yeah!

[Chorus: Jimmy Hendrix] (Erick Sermon)
There must be some kind of way outta here (I'm gonna find it yeah I'm gonna find it!)
There must be some kind of way outta here (Yeah I'm goin this way!)
There must be some kind of way outta here (I'm gonna find it yeah I'm gonna find it!)
There must be some kind of way outta here (Oh yeah I'm goin that way!)</pre>
