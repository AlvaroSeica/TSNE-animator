Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Ain't no ain't nobody fuckin with me
I run my city daddy
I'm the man where I live
Tell em what my name is
Chip tha ripper chip chip tha ripper
Chip tha ripper chip chip tha ripper

[Verse 1]
I'm a wreckin cappin money stackin
Pistol packin son of a bitch
I'm throwed I'm so throwed in the club
And I got my gun in this btich
Niggas be hatin talkin shit
But I don't get mad and throw no fits
I'm a let my gun do like the tip of my dick
Everytime I'm with yo bitch
Blast off cock boom
Bar b que sauce all over the streets
Pieces of of you everywhere
U almost as famous as me
Yeah I know you like my whip
But leave it at that cause I ain't no punk
Got a diamond in the back
And a sunroof top
Everytime I cock my glock I dunk
Forty five in my shotgun pump
Blow you out yo god damn socks nigga
I don't give a fuck you ain't heard about me
I'm a muthafuckin ox nigga
Flyer than a muthafucka hoes come and get me
I stepped out in my gator boots
And crocidile dundee tried to trip me
I don't play with these haters
I let em off until they empty
I bring kibbles and bits to the hood
So tell them pitbulls come and sick me
All it takes is one pound to the crown
And you lose no matter what game you playin
You can't beat the boss

[Chorus: 2X]
Ain't no ain't nobody fuckin with me
I run my city daddy
I'm the man where I live
Tell em what my name is
Chip tha ripper chip chip tha ripper
Chip tha ripper chip chip tha ripper

[Verse 2]
I'm a get my dough I'm a get my bread
Hundred dolla bills are worth
Alot more than yo head
What you wanna do
I got money in the bank
Tryna play battleship with chip tha rip
Yo ship will sank
I sip purple drank I blow purple dank
Twenty eights on a hummer truck
Will make it look like army paint
Hold up hold up stop hold up stop
My mind is blank
That hydro got my mind blown I can't think
Now are them 28s on that lil chevorlet
Or am I trippin
My car sits up to high
How the hell are we gonna get in
If it wasn't 24s and up
Then it wasn't chip then
Doors go outter or up up in the air I lift them
The wood in the middle of the christmas tree
Is what is what I'm grippin
Clear finger nail polish is what my car got dipped in
Nuts colored golden brown so I'm sittin in chicken
The outside of my whip is the color of tea
So I'm sittin in lipton

[Chorus: 2X]
Ain't no ain't nobody fuckin with me
I run my city daddy
I'm the man where I live
Tell em what my name is
Chip tha ripper chip chip tha ripper
Chip tha ripper chip chip tha ripper</pre>
