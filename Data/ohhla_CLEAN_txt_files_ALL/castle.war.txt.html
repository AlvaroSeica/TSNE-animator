[movie sample]
I'm afraid you must defeat me first.. hahahaha
Do you think I escaped into this water mill?
{*sounds of sword fighting*}

[Hook: Warcloud]
Warcloud as Alcatraz, lyrics you couldn't figure yet
I came here to smoke a donut and eat a cigarette

[Intro: Warcloud]
It's Warcloud, formerly known as Holocaust
There could be no other Holocaust
Come and get battered and dismantled

[Warcloud]
Black Roman Trojan with an arm full of corrosion
Fighting in a mighty war with a heavy sword that's golden
Through the screams and explosions I move while cannons are loaded
To dismember a million warriors and arrest by Earth's erosion
My devotion is to AWOL rappers and smash tanks
We stand on a sea made of glass, the King's a saint
I thrust my sword into a cloud, how villains burn
The sky broke thunder on a song that no man could learn
Warcloud, stone steps red, galactic heartless

[Hook 2x]

[Warcloud]
I drag motherfuckers off into the sewers, they're losers
Disrespect, you fail, wind up in Mexican jail
Tequila crash fire across your face, I'm off the place
Sipping pi√±a coladas in the Bahamas with anacondas
And if people get to Hell their thoughts are harmful
Pistol pop your ass, chop a rapper's head with a car door
The written mental books of many wars, they don't make them anymore
Your verbal death, you have heard of the criminology of psychology
Brainwash to attack you, I stash a package in a statue
Added to the vitality, watch it burn through 'The Realm of Reality'
You drop out of a climate, drop your wife down in the hill's grave
Verbal 'Pet Sematary', gun men down in the preliminary
Bloody construction yard of angry men, still try to change me then
Being in the American forces of Saratoga
Between 1875 to revolutionize revolution
Dusty cannons will barge your harbours
Your rap's baffled by 'The Last Castle'

[Hook x2]

[Warcloud]
I found a dead woman in the river painted with makeup
At the horse races, champ bounce before I quake up
Keep you blown away, keep heavy slugs from the Grey Goose
Handle made from Indian wood, used in a jail
My black catholic, antediluvian scripture pop you
I'm deep, heavy graffiti, now windy driving Tahiti
Old Spaghetti Factory Vampire
Eat gold diamonds and rubies off of emerald plates
Titanium plate ribcages, Hell's Gate
I bleed hellfire, son always finish the game
Shatter your cranium or vertebrae ceremonial
Warcloud is wicked God, found a body down in the Bahamas
Stewardess Fear Arcana, an afterlife train station
Dirty weapons like frost fruit
Molotov caught a log, shadow figures in a world of hog
Hungry people of the Miss Liberty Justice
Eaten by 'The Children of Twilight'
Assassination vacation way down in Champagne, France
Gung ho gun fighters and Great Chiefs
They used an old sick tree
Once for a town criminal jail
This December remember the White Buffalo
