[Verse 1]
Dear Ms. Remy Ma, Ms Thang of NY
I know you representing, whether on the streets or inside
I know you in there talking shit, all sassy
With ya New York swag, your voice all raspy
Running the house, checking bitches
and lastly, know you on your bunk, bout to roll up something grassy
You ain't heard from me, so it's gotta be reasons
On some real shit, I been fighting my own demons
I should'a been flew you a kite, or sent some kinda mail
But my brother fought cancer and he couldnt prevail
And these faggot label niggas, tryna take me through hell
Putting all they effort in it, tryna get me to  fail

[Chorus]
I know that it's hard, a little bit stressed out
Just wanna let you know that I'm holding you down
Cause you're my sister, you know that I love ya
And anytime you need me , I'll be around
Girl you know we gotta keep our head up
And even though we fed up, we gotta be strong
So just hold on, hold on

[Verse 2]
So I walk soft, and  don't sleep
I'm a humble beast
Cook my own pots, I'm my own chef
So I'm gone eat
I know you gone weep, but you ain't missing shit
Same silly shit
you know these bitches, same shit
It's a few chicks done came in the game, they all sounding the same
But they safe, long as they stay on they face
Anyway, they all say, this rap thing is done
But with Barack in the chair, maybe a change will come
Little belts and tight jeans , boys wearing girl clothes
Now days, dudes take more of a feminine role
Khaled still stealing budgets for artists, he can't pop
Fat Joe did a album, but his shit just flopped
Damn

[Chorus]
I know that it's hard, a little bit stressed out
Just wanna let you know that I'm holding you down
Cause you're my sister, you know that I love ya
And anytime you need me , I'll be around
Girl you know we gotta keep our head up
And even though we fed up, we gotta be strong
So just hold on, hold on

[Verse 3]
And they say it's a movement, but that shit gone crumble
Silly niggas had the ball and they ass just fumbled
I'm still tryna fill my duffle, staying on my hustle
Wether I get it off a show or the muscle
I still spit it while licking the wood of  a joint of reefer
Still doing my thang, just more of a overseerer
I'ma let these sissy niggas have the airwaves
And still ball and stick out my tongue like MJ
Still rocking my jewels, just less fancy
This recession shit,got broke  niggas antsy
No more bottles in the club, that shit brings haters
I just workout everyday and drink protein shakes
You a real bitch, don't think the world will ever forget you
Rem, I been there
So please don't think my heart ain't with you
I know you preaching and you teaching to them chick, your views
While you crunching ya cheese doodles, over ya cup of noodles

[Chorus]
I know that it's hard, a little bit stressed out
Just wanna let you know that I'm holding you down
Cause you're my sister, you know that I love ya
And anytime you need me , I'll be around
Girl you know we gotta keep our head up
And even though we fed up, we gotta be strong
So just hold on, hold on</pre>
