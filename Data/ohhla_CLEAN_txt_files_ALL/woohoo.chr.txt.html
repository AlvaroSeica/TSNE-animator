[Chorus]
You know you really wanna (hey), wanna taste my
You know you wanna get a peek wanna see my
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips are
Kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)
All the boys think its cake when they taste my (woohoo)
You dont even need a plate, just your face Ha!
Licky-licky yum-yum what a great guy
Now kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)
K-kiss on my, all over my
K-k-kiss on my, a-a-all over my

[Verse 1]
Feel eyes on me everywhere I go
Like a little boy up in the candy store
Get your craving to get your hands on
Give it up before momma says no
Imma let you get a little closer
Even though I aint suppose to
I like it strong when it's long 'cause
I'm a little tipsy, play along with me

[Chorus]
You know you really wanna (hey), wanna taste my
You know you wanna get a peek wanna see my
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips are
Kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)
All the boys think its cake when they taste my (woohoo)
You dont even need a plate, just your face Ha!
Licky-licky yum-yum what a great guy
Now kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)
K-kiss on my, all over my
K-k-kiss on my, a-a-all over my

[Verse 2]
K-kick ya socks off, your zipping kinda slow
Wanna see just how you take It down low
Hurry up I wanna see a bit more
Take it off before momma gets dull
I Know that you love me long time Yeah
You wanna take It for a ride Yea
I'm feeling bad And I like it
I'm a little tipsy play along with me
Hey!

[Chorus]
You know you really wanna (hey), wanna taste my
You know you wanna get a peek wanna see my
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips are
Kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)
All the boys think its cake when they taste my (woohoo)
You dont even need a plate, just your face Ha !
Licky-licky yum-yum what a great guy
Now kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)
K-kiss on my, all over my
K-k-kiss on my, a-a-all over my

[Verse 3]
All the ladies up in the place
It's your turn
Can't fulfill her in the middle of the day
Around with words
(Ohh Woo ohh Woo Ouu Ou Ohh)
I know I probably shouldn't but, uh, I'm feeling good
(Ohh Woo ouu Woo Ouu Oo Ou Ohh)
I'm a little tipsy play along with me

[Nicki Minaj]
O-okay, guess who got that mhm-mhm nani-nani
In the Mondrian, mhm-mhm, in Miami
Whiz Galliano, whip-whip the Armani
In the drip-drip, lick-lick like a Lolly
Or, left from Jamaica, going foreign couture
Jimmy Iovine, Tom Wali and Dior
Keep me and Chrissy in Christian Dior
But that was before, or, for you
My name Nicki, little daddy, and you?
You can do anything you put your mind to
Way you French kiss it, "fran√ßais parlez vous"
Way you work your tongue can I hire you?

[Chorus with ad-libs from Aguilera]
You know you really wanna (hey), wanna taste my
You know you wanna get a peek wanna see my
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips Are
Kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)
All the boys think its cake when they taste my (woohoo)
You dont even need a plate, just your face Ha !
Licky-licky yum-yum what a great guy
Now kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)
K-kiss on my, all over my
K-k-kiss on my, a-a-all over my

[Outro]
You wanna taste my [x2]
You wanna see my
(You ready)
WooHoo
All my ladies say (woohoo)
If you gotta great (woohoo)
Let him get a peek (woohoo)
If you gotta sweet (woohoo)
Let me hear you scream (woohoo)
But bitches keep it clean (woohoo)
WooHoo</pre>
