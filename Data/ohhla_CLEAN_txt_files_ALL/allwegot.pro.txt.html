[Intro: Prodigal Sunn]
Yeah party live tonight, baby
Straight from New York, live from Los Angeles
I want everybody to get together, man
Let's be all we got (Sunzini)
Party goin' down, listen to the sounds
(The Great Sunzini)

[Chorus: Prodigal Sunn]
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got

[Interlude: Prodigal Sunn]
When you in ya hood, man
Listen to yaself, man

[Prodigal Sunn]
I play the caves like Hansel and Gretal
Stay mellow, rock 'fros, gold metal, account filled with Dineros
I see ladies in the atmosphere, black hair
Fresh ho's from past mere, told me to come here
Party at the peer, drunk off of Henny and beer
Sharp as an Indian spear, lady give me ya ear
Many were here, the black Sunzini in time
CD of rhymes ease the mind, some bleed for the need to shine
All I need is trees on line, we stay high... so high
We get by, simple of black, chemical, critical rap
Timberland hat, laced in a suit from Phat

[Chorus: Prodigal Sunn]
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got (party people live)
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got (people in the struggle)
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got (people in the world)
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got

[Prodigal Sunn]
Gamble the dice, remain humble, scramble through the jungle of life
While the we rumble with the foul and trife
Shots fired on the block in threes like Glen Rice
Made men think twice about the sacrifice
Black or white, write it for the world to hear
Write it for my fam who not here who do care
Glance and stare, why when you can't compare?
From the bottom of my feet to the end of my hair
Move rear, cop the blue steel bare, groove to the snare
Bass and drums, see my face in the slums
Pedia Brown, media surround my sound
When you see me around respected in the the hood of ya town

[Chorus: Prodigal Sunn]
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got (party people live)
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got (people in the struggle)
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got (people in the world)
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got (party people live)
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got

[pause]

[Chorus: Prodigal Sunn]
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got (party people live)
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got (people in the struggle)
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got (people in the world)
Yo we all we got, yo we all we got</pre>
