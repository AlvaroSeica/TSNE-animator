[Chorus: Crunch Lo (Shawn Wigs)]
Come here, cuz you shine, give me a little time
You catch my eye, like a dime walking by
(Come here, cuz you shine, like fine wine and good taste
Caught my eye, like a dime, walking by
By the way, body, physically, a perfect ten immaculate
The fly shit something I gots to get with)

[Crunch Lo]
Slipped away into my zone, walking in the rain like Grace Jones
Going to the store to get a Dutch bone
I see my shorty, hear the sound of his Titan forties
I gave him love, asked him where the gritties, cuz I'm horny
Yo, pa, around the corner, there's a chocolate bar
Inside the second store, just go and turn the doorknob
Walked to the back, she's real sweet, and real black
But watch ya back, a nigga scheme when you step to that
So I left with information of her dress code
A plastic suit and she'll look like she'll explode
Out of vict, she got cake got Betty Crocker
But I'mma burn her soul and make her step a little hotter
Ask the dred in the store, he brought me up real quick
He said if you get her, you get a Heini' with it
I said 'peace', sign her to me over like a lease
Took her to my crib then wrapped her up in my sheets
I hit it while I drank, she making me think
Now she all in my bank, and my moms think she stink
But she get higher, than a mountain peak
Aiyo, I'm talking bout this weed, I'm talking bout this dime piece

[Molly-Q]
Been sir, you fit to traum', Nefertiti sweetie
Bikini brown tone, the true I Dream of Jeannie
Used to trick with nicks and trays back in the day
But a dime, I spend time and eat her pussy all day
The fortune smackers, hold a 20, it's lovely
Butter jimmy's like windy, hot and sticky in that honey
Milk duds banging, brown tone, I'm always hanging
Spanish tetas dangling in the web, I keep tangling
Caught up in those fives and knee highs, that look fly
Undergarment got me high, time to star 69
Monage twois, at bars, with the tribe
But with my dime piece, I keep that ass in my palm

[Chorus: Crunch Lo (Shawn Wigs)]
Come here, cuz you shine, give me a little time
You catch my eye, like a dime walking by
(Come here, cuz you shine, like fine wine and good taste
Caught my eye, like a dime, walking by
By the way, body, physically, a perfect ten immaculate
The fly shit something I gots to get with)

[Shawn Wigs]
Aiyo, peep the physique on this dime piece, Playboy model
Strip dancing, cock tease, got me all wound up
Ready for action, I approached
Slip me the digits on the back, of her match coat
Her name turned out to be Exquisite, with a 1-800 number
I said 'son, I ain't with it'
But she responsed in a freshly loose vagina
The name, 800 number might just be a minor
So I proceeded to call her up on the teleph'
She said I wanna 'freak you' like Ghostface and Chef
On that Jodeci remix, I said you got tricks
You hit me with a nine, I hit you with a six
She pulled up in this jet black Lexus
I came hoodied down, she blew me a kiss
Garter belts and a skin tight blouse
I said where we headed boo? Peter Luger Steakhouse
She lit up a bone and some exotic home grown
Her body was tone, I couldn't wait to get her home
We sip Saint Paul's and had fat filet mignon
Garlic knots and pasta, shells and privolone
This dime piece I found, is too good, I must be dead
She let me whip the Lexus, she gave me head
All the way home to the crib, Grimes Hill, Staten Isle
Yo, that night turned out to be wild
