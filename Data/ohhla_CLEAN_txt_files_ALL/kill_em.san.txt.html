Dude, c'mon, you know what you gotta do this time around

(Kill 'em) You niggaz ain't nuttin
(Kill 'em) You niggaz is frontin
(Kill 'em) You niggaz don't want it, kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em
My niggaz they get it (Money)
Your niggaz can't get it (Money)
We'll kill you to get it (Money)

[Juelz]
It's like everything I'm doin is gangsta
My whole movement is gangsta, I maneuver with gangstas
I put the TRU in the gangsta
I'm a nuisance to gangstas, I be shootin at gangstas (kill 'em)
If he blink wrong (kill 'em)
If he think wrong (kill 'em)
Show this muthafucka these ain't no painballs (kill 'em)
Put his eight ball dead in the side pocket
Some lead from a hot rocket, left in his side pocket (kill 'em)
Fuck a microwave, that'll turn his head to a hot pocket
I'm beggin you ock stop it, cause never do I stop it whenever do I pop it I
(Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em)
Haha, YEA
I lay around all day with the pound all day
Dawg, I don't play around all day (No)
I pop up with the glock up like its groundhogs day
And then I let a round off man
Now how that sound off man, when that pound go bang
Your face chow lo mein (Bye)
Chow lil' man, I'm great, when you see me, bow lil' man

[Chorus x2]
You niggaz ain't nuttin
Kill 'em) You niggaz is frontin
Kill 'em) You niggaz don't want it, kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em
My niggaz they get it (Money)
Your niggaz can't get it (Money)
We'll kill you to get it (Money)

[Juelz]
When the glock go (bang)
When the shots go (bang)
All you gon hear is (kill 'em kill 'em kill 'em kill 'em)
And I'm not no (game)
I pop those (things)
All you gon hear is (kill 'em kill 'em kill 'em kill 'em)
For them nachos I'll (kill ya)
For my block yo I'll (kill ya)
Let this nigga know he's not no guerilla
And that's not no chinchilla
That's a chopped up guerilla that they chopped up to git cya
And you bought it (kill 'em)
This is not a real nigga, he not in my picture
I ate lobster for dinner
He got spam on his plate, he got ham on his plate
I don't eat pork, hand me some steak
Nigga hand me some cake, fore I hand you the eight
Like a muthafuckin hand that you shake (bitch)
Give you five nigga, I'ma live nigga
Who, what, where, when, why nigga, I nigga (kill 'em)

[Chorus x2]
You niggaz ain't nuttin
Kill 'em) You niggaz is frontin
Kill 'em) You niggaz don't want it, kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em
My niggaz they get it (Money)
Your niggaz can't get it (Money)
We'll kill you to get it (Money)

[Cam'Ron]
What's my name? (Killa)
Who I be with? (Killas)
What them bitches say? (Killa Killa Killa Killa)
Uh Oh there go a catfight, bitches they spar for dome
Get in the car they foam, never seen cars with phones? (Never?!)
Santana, I give any part to holmes
Eye, ear, heart or bone, back out the orange cones (back up)
Even though I go right at the sergeant stoned
Right with my orange stones, we are at home
Get movin and took out, I'm usin the hood route
Hustla please, man you was the look out
Man just look out, I'm a ragin bull
With amazing ?sold?, so I'm paid in full
But there's no movie pra, dawgy this the uzi ride
That'll leave you cutie rootie tootie little booty pie
It's my duty doc, you try to sue me, stop
How you try to judge me, I get Judge Judy shot
Now sue me ock, I just lay and smile
I'll rape your child, they won't make the trial, Killa!</pre>
