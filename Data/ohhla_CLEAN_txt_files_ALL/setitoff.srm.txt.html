[Verse One: Mone]
Hands to the ceilin yeah we come to do work
Don't nobody move ain't nobody gettin murked
Wrist covered in jewels time piece a small work
Diamonds screamin hallelujah watch cost a small church
Get it how we live it, spend it like we print it
Everything we tint it we buy it you niggas rent it
No, don't be offended I give you niggas the business
Stay in your bitches dentures you would think I was a dentist
They label me a menace, and waxed 
Homey you need that white, Ajax
We move 'em by the square, 8 tracks
Swag on a mill I ain't even to the max yet
Racks on top of racks shit we all about that action
Bunch of bold yellow bone bitches Toni Braxton
Take a hard hit, to the face, Meeka Claxton
Your bitch up on my stick, when I hit I'm Reggie Jackson

[Chorus: Erick Sermon &amp; Swizz Beatz]
We 'gon get it poppin in thus mu'fucker GET IT POPPIN!!!

[Verse Two: Erick Sermon]
Uh! Yessir I feel great
And! Even if there's hate in the air I'm still straight
And! Even though they sayin we dead it's my state 
It's the apple, this balloon won't deflate 
Nah not while I'm present, when you hear the E regard sum'n
Think it come out fly whoever says it
And that's why I stay so Polo down 
Yet! My dunks be the newest, my jeans be the bluest
Got bread like I'm jewish, address me as mister
Chicks gather around like it's a bar mitzvah
Callin me daddy but I ain't Twista
Callin me poppa but I ain't Christopher
You checkin out one of God's best's

[Chorus: Erick Sermon &amp; Swizz Beatz]
We 'gon get it poppin in thus mu'fucker GET IT POPPIN!!!

[Verse Three: Fred Da Godson]
I put the work out, chopper, how 'bout the Tahoe?
They Lost Boyz, still hyped, Freaky Yah flow
Yeah I go, if you gettin money you happy
Nigga when you tripple your work, then you get at me
They slippin on they pimpin I got the shotty I'm limpin
Hit me tee no livin you'll get it if you just listen
Like they 'gon pay ten I'm Shawn Kemp and when I'm limpin
Gary Payton get it sorry now Rick unless you spittin
I'm the best by far, they gotta keep they flow tighter
I hit the club by the bar no ghost writer
Get out the bar, dancefloor, hold her close tighter
And by the bar wakeup, with no clothes by her
I'm so fat boy fresh
With that rap boy, you know that boy the best
Swizzy on the beat, Erick Sermon a legend
Fred Da Eagle the future with a weapon, I'm outta here

[Chorus: Erick Sermon &amp; Swizz Beatz]

[Verse Four: Swizz Beatz]
I'm chillin in my Aston Martin with fo' doors

You niggas actin sick well I'll make you niggas cough
Plus I'm ridin clean bitch I got them white bars
I'm chillin what I got, with them billion dollar toys
That billion dollar walk I got that billion dollar spark (COME ON!!!)

You niggas talkin crazy bet you niggas won't talk
Put your money where your mouth or put your house up with the kids (RIGHT)
