Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus x2: Kirko Bangz]
Straight for the summer
Straight for the summer
In shape for the summer
She gon' be straight for the summer in shape for the summer
Straight for the summer
Straight for the summer
Ass pokin' out, stomach pokin' in
Just got her new membership at the gym
Goin hard all winter just so she can be

[Verse 1: Vado]
Ma what's the word tho? it's me spiff, Kirko
Two straps showing no Urkel
Grape fives on his black purple
Keep a nice number eight two circles
She in my vein like an I.V
In that new thing color high-C
That's my boo thang nigga try me
Love to show her shoe game on the IG
I can't wait for the summer
Shit lookin' great for the summer
A dyck man lotta cake in the summer
An iron man audi R8 in the summer
Naw coke I got a live one
Always turnt up a do or die one
Any bird that I have she a fly one
Long fur let it drag on the garson

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Shorty so cold she get hate from the summer
Tight little dress look great for the summer
Lookin' ass niggas couldn't wait for the summer
Like damn girl you gained a little weight for the summer
New bitches at the house renovate for the summer
All want to stay can't hate on a slumber
Party, shawty, shape like a number
Eight, 458 for the summer
Get a nigga bitch hooked like bait for the summer
She ain't coming out hibernate for the summer
Can't find they everything coming out neither
Nigga no release date for the summer
Thirsty ass niggas I ain't got nothing for ya'll
I'm a let your ass dehydrate for the summer
I fuck with my niggas gettin' paper like a printer
Standing tall like centers had to grind all winter to be

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge: Vado]
Ah, that's how you do that there
Deserve to make head turns like who that there?
VIP whole team, my crew back there?
We the Best and you knew that there

[Chorus x2]</pre>
