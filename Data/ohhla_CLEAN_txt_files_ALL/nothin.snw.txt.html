[Verse 1: Edo G]
Disconnect, disrespect, disinfect
Diss your set, diss your threat
Miss your step then you wish you slapped
You ain't hard enough to be disarec (?)
Fire and the hits direct
Hightec ride on an automotive like a sky tec
On stage bring the live set
On page doin shit you ain't tried yet
Been caged to got my mind set and raged with styles you ain't find yet
I blaze for miles know how to rhyme get
Up mountains that you ain't climbed yet I timed it
Cause you need to be reminded, blinded, criminal minded
Lookin for a star like mine you can't find it
Even if you are landed with conlet
I got the fly shit call me the pilot

[Chorus: repeat 2X]

[Verse 2: Edo G]
Stage your business
I'm takin prisoners
Breaking visitors for all the shady listeners
Hate particulars ain't no sticky-less
Labels diggin us on the streets they're so quick to bust
I ainÂ´t guess jam do there us
We do to them what they do to us
Who's to trust
The future's us would you discuss
In a car train plane or do the bus
You used to use hiphop
Now it's using us
Confusing us abusing us
Doze en masse you see the self defence
Or you chose to bust
I smell bullshit I gotta nose to bust
And I don't rap about the frozen stuff
You're posing tuffs
Down low I'm postin up
Your toast is up
You're too scared to get close to us
