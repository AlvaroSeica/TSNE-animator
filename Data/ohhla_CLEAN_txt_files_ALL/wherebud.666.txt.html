(Verse 1, Lord Infamous)
I feel the need for the weed
The smoke, go geek
They said the tree's just for me
The J the O, the I-N-T
The B, the-the-the U
The-the-the D
Ohhwee, gimme shotgun
Oh please, oh please
No chicken feet
But, chicken wing
Pick out the seeds
The heat, is hitting me
Me need the grits, we gotta have it
Don't want no cabbage
We hate that babbage
Like savage
We-we-we wanna
The marijuana
Or we goners
Yo man I'm gonna
Go 'round the corner
Get right on a
A-a-a sack
I need contact, I need it bad
So I can mack
Just-just-just like that
Yo Black, where da bud at?

(Hook, Lord Infamous)
Wheeere is da bud? Where is da bud?
Wheeere is da bud? Where is da bud?
Wheeere is da bud? Where is da bud?
Wheeere is da buuud? Where is da bud?

Where is thee bud?
We looking for thee bud
Where is thee bud?
We looking for da bud (Pump!)
Where is thee bud?
We looking for thee bud

(Verse 2, Lord Infamous)
They call me Lord Infamous
But you can call me Scarecrow
I need me some red-hair
Chicken, or some in-do'
And I need a couple of quarts of motherfuckin' Red-Bull
We smokin' the chicken, we chokin' the chicken
Straight y'all are takin' hard pulls
You'll get a whiff, when you step up, in the air
We smoke bud anywhere, yeah bitch, we don't care
Cause when we get that urge
To fire up that chicken man
A nigga must campaign
Clouds up in the brain
Ohh, that chicken got me hype
Foo, me so hype dogg
Blowin' so much bud
Full chiefin' contacts off the fog
This shit is burnin' too quick
Fuck these little junts
Let's go to the store
Get some cigars
Roll some Phillie blunts
Damn dude, ain't shit in this sack
But some fuckin' shake
I'm some more weed
And I just can't fuckin' wait, mack
Let's go, where da bud at?
Let's go, where da bud at?
Let's go, where da bud at, mang?

(Hook, Lord Infamous)
Wheeere is da bud? Where is da bud?
Wheeere is da bud? Where is da bud?
Wheeere is da bud? Where is da bud?
Wheeere is da buuud? Where is da bud?

Where is thee bud?
We looking for thee bud
Where is thee bud?
We looking for thee bud (Pump!)
Where is thee bud?
We looking for thee bud
Where is thee bud?
We looking for thee bud

Wheeere is da bud? Where is da bud?
Wheeere is da bud? Where is da bud?
Wheeere is da bud? Where is da bud?
Wheeere is da buuud? Where is da bud?

(Lord Infamous)

Everybody in Memphis, we looking for thee bud</pre>
