[Makeba Mooncycle]
Just an average day in the neighborhood, some bad, some good
The race to see who live another day
Who went get locked up or sprayed, laid in the grave
Now since it's my neighborhood, I'mma call him Jay
Used to bounce around like a bad boy who play
Known as the totting weed smoking, black Jesus don't provoke him
Rest out in the Desert, sometimes hit Medina
Death was on his trail, though you should of seen her
Underneath the covers, they became lovers
Momma saw dreams of a tomb
So she looked around his room, the truth was uncovered
Frustration of a mother; Where'd you get that piece?
You making me scared, stay home tonight
I don't want you out there, but life was a party
Never thought of what he did, or reminisce
On the life that he lived, you better watch your back
Now here comes karma, cuz from here on
Your life's full of drama

[Chorus: Makeba Mooncycle]
Can you hear a cry?
Seeing her son die
Nobody know's why
Tell me, can you hear a cry?

[Makeba Mooncycle]
In that same neighborhood, living down the street
Lived a young couple, baby made complete
Poverty to paradise, paradise to poverty
Stick it out together, stand right beside me
No one should test him, quick to get upset and then dead him
Trying to make things better for his girl and his seed
Let's make this cheddar, you follow, I lead
Now things get too hectic, put your boot to the ground
And treck it, but kid jumped out, from having second doubts
Your man is assed out, when the shots rang out
She took a look at her son
But no, not another one, back at the scene again
Cops called a hooligan, must of been a rub
He's just another thug, mark it, case closed
Casket under rose, didn't believe it was true
When the boy broke the news, felt like a dream
Dead on the scene, I won't forget the past
Cuz my son is the aftermath

[Chorus II: Makeba Mooncycle]
She said momma don't know why
Your daddy had to die
Nobody know's why
But baby's gonna be alright

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Stayed in the streets and cut school
Him and his old E lived on York Avenue, since he was the youngest
The only one there, so full of anger
So full of fear, he had to make some loot
He wanted to escape, his mom was bit by a poisonous snake
The pipe was a guy, she pushed him aside
No here's the deal, his heart's hard of steel
Cuz there's nothing too real when you're taught not to feel
Another motherless child gon' wild, now he's getting riches
Stacking his cash, your moms still hitting and she steals your stash
Walks in the house, crack in the kitchen
Moms doped up and his stash is missing
Could this be a dream, he screams
Ma, you a fiend, but she didn't care
Looking out the window, like nobody's there

[Chorus III: Makeba Mooncyle]
Seen the pain in his eyes
Watching his momma die
Nobody's know's why
Nobody's know's why

[Outro: Makeba Mooncycle]
The moral of the story is
Everything happen's for a reason
You can't ask yourself why
Just learn from it</pre>
