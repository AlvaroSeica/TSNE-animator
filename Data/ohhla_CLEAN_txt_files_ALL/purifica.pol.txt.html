[Chorus  Singin' D  2X]
There's a serpent in my soul
Before the venom takes its hold
We hafee, whoa
We hafee Murda dem, murda dem
To feel the purification

[Dirt Gritie]	
When the physicals appeased the mind is at ease 
At easy flowing like a tree in the breeze 
Late nights in the park with my peeps sharing dreams 
Pennies in the wishing well or so it seems 
We wolves howling at the moon 
Trying to make something out of nothing just like the maroons 
From ox tail chicken foot soup to curry goat stew 
Scraps, made into gourmet food 
These are the things I would eat as a youth 
Not understanding what granny went through 
Now we first generation Canadian true 
And we ain't got a worry bout water or food 
Given every opportunity to plant our roots 
So we might as well build that's what we gone do
Nine-six born equal 
Out of many one people

[Chorus  Singin' D  2X]
There's a serpent in my soul
Before the venom takes its hold
We hafee, whoa
We hafee Murda dem, murda dem
To feel the purification

[Young Mav]		
Weapons of deception, plans of deceit
Only way to brake'm, make'm not eat
Youth'll rebel, guns ain't for sale
There yours for free, just shoot your own team
Youth'll use'm, Governments produce them
Then they wait for fate, to provide solutions
Destabilize, news'll feed lies
Over throw a man try'na make things right
Many migrate with hopes to be free
But wind up slaves to the GDP
When we lose our solidarity vision
We adhere a rat race, embrace corrupt systems
Join when we lose only thing we gain
Is the grief of prophets, who died in vain
Appease the displeased, protests decrease
But black politicians don't mean we're free

[Chorus  Singin' D  2X]
There's a serpent in my soul
Before the venom takes its hold
We hafee, whoa
We hafee Murda dem, murda dem
To feel the purification

[Bigga Nolte]
MP the opposition leada
Dem wan come take my freedom
Like they wan hurt me, come take my wisdom
Don't want me to be free
I keep it oohhh weee when mi see dem in yah
The one's dem'a give wi feva
Di gal dem go oohhh weee 
When dem see wi in yah
We destine to be free
They wan come take my pride
Come take my stripe
Dem no see our people hungry
But we hafee keep our strength
And keep our hype
We hafee stay strong for our country
We come yah for a betta life
Let's do it right
Let's get our education
Then the people will vibe
And the youth will strive
And then there'll be Purication, oh yo

[Bridge  Bigga Nolte]
Poor countries have school taxes
The youth can't get the knowledge 
To take care of themselves

[Back Up Vocalists]
We hafee murda dem, murdah dem
To feel the Purification

[Bridge  Bigga Nolte]
Osama come and hit your soil
But you wan put Sadaam pon di trial

[Back Up Vocalists]
We hafee murda dem, murdah dem
To feel the Purification

[Bridge  Bigga Nolte]
Katrina come and we go through crisis
Dem use that to raise up gas prices

[Back Up Vocalists]
We hafee murda dem, murdah dem
To feel the Purification

[Bridge  Bigga Nolte]
Dem say they have money fi start the war
But them have no money fi give di poor

[Back Up Vocalists]
We hafee murda dem, murdah dem
To feel the Purification

[Chorus  Singin' D  2X]
There's a serpent in my soul
Before the venom takes its hold
We hafee, whoa
We hafee Murda dem, murda dem
To feel the purification</pre>
