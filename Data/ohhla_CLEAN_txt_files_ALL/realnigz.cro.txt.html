[Intro]
Damn, when I leave all the real motherfuckers in the pins
Man tell me somebody out here gonna stand up
Set all these motherfuckers straight
Ye this Rick Ross, the real Rick Ross
Not the floss
Yeah them suckers got the game right now
They don't make 'em like they used too

[Chorus]
Real niggaz, real niggaz, real niggaz
They don't make 'em like they used too
No more, no more, no more
Real niggaz
Real niggaz, real niggaz, real niggaz
They don't make 'em like they used too
No more, no more, no more
Real niggaz

[Verse 1]
I vow to keep it real, never break the promise
I vow to keep it real, never break the promise
I vow to keep it real, never break the promise
Niggaz yell and deaf for focus honour, they dishonest
They some scrape piranhas, and the condo stakes up on us
Blame and framed up hatred, that's deeper than hatin' on us
How could you cut your brothers throat for the love of money
Snitching, cops don't even tell on eachother dumbie
Can't even holla at them, they want me to pay for they attention
Like some strippers, but I throw slugs instead of dollars at 'em
Offer them they papers, them niggaz autograph them
They got them dreaming in ways
Taught only my daughters had 'em
My circle's founded by, family who down to rise
We're moving mountain side, I'm surrounded by
Real niggaz

[Interlude]
Yeah we still got some real ones out here
Ain't too many, but you know that's the ones we'll be fucking with
Yeah, I'm in the studio tonight, Crooked I
Thanks baby, it's about time
Got a real motherfucker reached out for OG
You know what I'm sayin',
He was tryin' to get himself back on his feet
And gave a shot

[Verse 2]
Take a look around at the niggaz I came in the game with
I'm in the same click, I'm on the same ship
Clifford Harris shit, I'm on that same tip
I never change over chains I never shape shift
I never transform, I eat decepticons
And megatron's ain't nothing but test you on
Checking up in my restaurant
You with them detectives huh
Tryin' to help to arrest a don
I have my niggas knife in chest
And carve hex a gun
They heard what I said, yes
Reckon for the feds, yes
We got the word, them cameras behind
Them TV's in your hair ress
And I ain't new to this game
We'll either live together as brothers
Or perish as fools, said Martin Luther the King

[Chorus]
Real niggaz, real niggaz, real niggaz
They don't make 'em like they used too
(Nah)
No more, no more, no more
Real niggaz
Real niggaz, real niggaz, real niggaz
They don't make 'em like they used too
(They don't)
No more, no more, no more
Real niggaz</pre>
