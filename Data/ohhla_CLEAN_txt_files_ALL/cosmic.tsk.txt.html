[Chester P]
I'm the spacemen type, chewing meteoric porridge
The asteroid arsenal's beefing up my courage
The Lunar Base burglar, sun spots burn you up
I'll be shooting stars at Mars, the planet murderer
My spaceship's flying, a red dwarf alliance
Drying up the milky ways, galactic pirates
Thugged out astronaut, my mind can't be rescued
I sniff stardust, manufactured off Neptune
I'm the cosmic gypsy, tipsy from plutonium whisky
This freaky alien from Pluto gives me
My soldiers from the Solar, roll on your rapper-dreads
Like a herd of asteroids, spaceman, magnetic space shower
- My debris clashes Jupiter
Heavyweight powers, all my forces are nuclear
So keep your cursive distance, feel when I snap
Like a Venus penis-trap, from Mercury and back
I'm known by kingpins in drug rings of Saturn
You mess with this space-fog and something's gotta happen
So grab the Southern crust if that's any constellations
Some space stations serve shit from Uranus
But they get demolished by the inter-stellar famous
Spaceman type from section that's nameless
I'm the cosmic gypsy, welcome to my kingdom
The space is my wife and these planets are my children

[Braintax]
In my capsule, blast trough, green escape pod
Floating on through the velvet robes, a sun god
Radio has gone dead I navigate past the Plough
Feel ecstatic, like "Hey mum look at me now!"
Rough course traveling, infinite space palace
Hope I'm on the face with Aurora Borealis type light shows
Diamonds where I tread on space carpet
Volcanic aeronus, brewed 'em in the Antarctic
Show me a sign, a doc for the inter-planetary flea market
Buy a frozen apple, I'll preserve for the shower when your ship gets hit
Burning up, I remember Earth, chewing on the pips
*Pip Pip Pip Pip*
Your lasers can't touch my tracking
I'm startsinct, with universal underground backing
The moonhopping massive and the cloud-steppers
Plutionians, satenights, guided by satellites
My stellar encompasses energy and mindstate
Emit solar power, O2 and gyrate
Stay adrift, oceans down before ships
Sail my galleon, caravan time-line trips

[Farma G]
Farma stargazer, inter-stellar space chase
Asteroid belt waist line, lunar man pays
Universal supernovas, guide to the galaxy
Hitchhiking time.bandit seeking ET
Sleepwalker in the starts, spirits of the skies
Astrology reborn, with Taurus by my side
I free celestial latitudes sliding down black holes
My hemisphere magic brings spaceman snow
Stardust shower, grey plough sky harvest
Satellite demolition, chicken run with a Tardis
My Starship Enterprise is inter-planetary
With big banging theories, from here to Pleiades
The summes souls countdown to be solar
The moon's in the ninth house, an old star ordes
Angular planets descending from their birthplace
In tune with the infinite, desirable skyscraper
A cosmical period, a cycle of heaven
The biology of God, I tie the ribbon in the sky
Atmospheric radiation, technological meltdown
Orbiting planets for elemental powers found
My head's buried in volumes, a space encyclopedia
Super nature creatures, Farma star healer
I watch the Autumn equinox the burn that Titan
I bathe in moonrays that feel totally enlightened
In love with the stars, seduced by the Zodiac
Spaceman type, Farma universal man

[Jehst]
Lion of the Zodiac, know me as a zoomorphic messenger
Who orbits the regular, star north of Nebula
Stormcloud dweller, moonboots stepping on the inter-stellar path
- Let a trail of the lexicon
Alphabet soup, dragon space suit sentinel
Keep off the stargate, my soul stays chemical
Old space in several places, zero gravitational fields
- The stars plough my acres
I'm weightless now, in Mother Nature's imagination
Escape the status of carbonite preservation
I occupy lunar bases and moon craters
The shield mje from meteor storms and new dangers
Cosmos, conquistador crusaders
And space age sabre-tooth tiger suit slayers
Explore the dunes, we move with the spice minors
Beside sience, black holes and white giants
Psychic neckrunners and android headhunters
Cyber punks bungee jumping off the third rock
Mixing Smirnoff with Dandelion &amp; Burdock
Moonjuice sipping, step-children of the Earth gods
- My home's a heaven
I fell back to earth where electric sheep feed on the astro turf
I surf the network, and my skin turns silver
Metallic anatomy, the space probe builder
Rainbow conceiver, I'm bleeding mercury
Caught in a timewarp, and all I see is burgundy
My fingertips glisten, gripping crystallised flowers
Red and green sparkle, marvel at the powers
Asteroid showers, inter-planetary rainfall
Brainstorm colourcharts, the cosmic paintball
The mega-blast, travel on the Battle Star Galactica
Jehst! The invalid to infiltrated Gattica

I'm the cosmic gypsy, welcome to my kingdom
The space is my wife and these planets are my children
Spaceman............
