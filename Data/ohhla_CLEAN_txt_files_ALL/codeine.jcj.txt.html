(Verse 1, Juicy J)
I'm fucked up... (Fucked up...)
On the lean, poppin rows with a Kush blunt (Yup)
With a bitch; ass fat, see it from the front (You know it!)
Mind gone, mane I'm trippin and my eyes low (Chuuuch!)
Everything purple, all I see is weed smoke (Oh!)
Codeine died, now my bitch gon' try (Mmm)
If you say "I ain't high", then you niggas lyin (Pussy)
A buncha trillist Memphis niggas, gettin throwed nigga (Bitch)
A buncha ho's at the crib, buncha O's nigga (Yep!)
Off that oil and it's dirty, and I'm feelin great
Smoke a blunt, or two, or three; just to keep me straight
You gettin high or what, ho? Make a decision
That medical Promethazine; Trippy prescription (Ho)
Cups overflowin, my vision is dizzy (Vision is dizzy)
I'm like Bobby Brown ho, without New Edition, chuch

(Verse 2, Juicy J)
Purple-purple-purple; cup always full (Ho)
Pass it in a circle; E'rrbody smokin good (Nigga)
On the daily; Might smoke an ounce to fuck around (Yep)
Weed-mane; So high when I'm in ya town
Two thousand fifty, trippy (Trippy!)
She got a sippy-cup (Sippy!)
They say "Don't drink and sip that lean!", but I mix 'em up
Turned up to the max; real ratchet shit (Hmm)
She mad, and she smoked prolly half that bitch (Ho!)
You niggas still gettin tipsy; catch me leanin
Smoked some incredible; feel like I'm dreamin (Dreamin!)
My crib in Cali; Like Texas, sippin DJ Screw (Rest in peace)
Fridge full of bombay; but you can't find no juice
