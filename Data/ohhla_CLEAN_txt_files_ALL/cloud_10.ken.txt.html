[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
When the sun fall out the sky
all I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me you need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me you love me

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
Fell into lust, where is the love?
My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
I look at the street corners as my new woman
Seductive as she wanna be, hands all on my garments
And luckily, being in denial ain't the case
cause I know she's unfaithful, instead I'm grabbing her waist
And every part of her is tasteful, and I know your feelings hating
In fact, you think I'm ungrateful, I know
Selfish as I wanna be, and every time you under me
I get the vibe you might need some time to grow

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
And every time that I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
I'm gone like a thief inside the wind
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know she want me more, but I fiend for Benjamins
She said I found the root of all evil and lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
that never knew love because love was never promised, I know
Selfish as I wanna be
And every time I'm under you, me too, need time to grow

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me you love me
Two time, baby tell me you love me</pre>
