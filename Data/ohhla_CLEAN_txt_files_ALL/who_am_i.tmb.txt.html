[Timbaland talking:]
Da Da Da Da Da Da
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
It's me again baby, Timbaland
And uh, we doin somethin like dis
Hear the beat? Uh
(*clapping*) Say what? That's right
Thank you, thank you, thank you
(*laughing*) Uh right now, I'ma bring a special guest in
He gon' rip it for me, like this, check it out

[Verse One: Twista]
Who am I, nigga with the blunt, steady trippin
Sippin on the concoction, with the gun cocktin
Drum knockin, gotta get off
Bitches and killas in the front watchin
Flowin with like a finna studda some
Betta come off a butta ton, brotha run, I hope he said he were
I'ma flow until my belly hurt
Pimp nigga rockin on the stage and rock on in the petty shirt
Let it ruff, ooh, feels like anotha one
Who you be? Mr. Shystie
The one who make you frown up like the lemon in my ice tea
The motherfucker most likely
To get a tuba with the opposition in my position 
I break 'em off when I give 'em the heat
Steady re' for rollin, nullets body decomposin
I dismember the weak on the Timbaland beat
You remember the beat, conversation we had
When my "Adrenalin" was rushin, check yo brakes and knee pads
When the Twista get to bustin, bodies gon' get rushed in
I can make 'em hit the dance flo', brothas, bitches, and hustlers
I get up in the guts homie, never phony
Hitta wigga when he run up on me
Yall motherfuckers still don't know me
Let 'em learn slowly

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Who you be? I'm the one that stay high
Center maka up the party, rockin bodies
Make ya throw ya hands up in the sky
Neva shy he's fly - who am I, who you be?
I'm the one's gon' get buck, T straight from the Chi
Verbal homicide, everybody duck
With the party up and pimp struck
T-N-T now what's up - who am I?

[Verse Two]
Who you be? Who am I? The one who's surrounded by the wood
500 with the ribs stickin through the hood
Up to no good thats why'd stay they misunderstood
And I'm always in the mix of some shits
Scoop a shawty and she thick
And the bitch getts grip in them hips
Putta dick on the lips top it doggie style, she my homie gal
So I tricked on that bitch, now who you be?
The one who's on the dance floor
Sex gon be one of the mass hoes
Freak on a bad hoe, youse could really wanna flash gold
Turn a hater to a sass hoe
Play and ballin up at Cape Town, strippin went down
Study, tippin off of CD's and tapes
Though see niggaz see Gs to take
Run up to the car, got no thangs
They got CD's to break, no easy pace, who you be?
The crime cause other obituary and eulogy
Photo stank and yall be who to see
Only smokin it with you and me
Lets go hang out where the booty be
I was on sumthin, no frontin
Yello wide ol' belly in the po funkin
Grinnin while up in the curb
Wanna journey for herb
Always tellin somebody to smoke somethin
True indeed

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
The one thats flowin fluently
Make yo baby say goo to me
Whatcha did to her
Didn't ask why I hit her for
Cause the game like liturature
Get it Get it gurl
I don't know what you was waitin on
But if you aint with a partna
This young monsters a fly guy
Shake a lil bit of dat body
We gon party till we sky high
To my playas and soldiers, shady niggaz, young thugs and strap hoes,
pimps strikin fees and red bones
Ghetto fees and Gs and MC's for the rifols
The one that be kickin off air time
From sunrise to bedtime
All of yall need to know me, the one and only
Pimp slach tingin twista from the Chi
Makin compotition die slowly
Who am I?

[Chorus]

[Timbaland]
Ha ha ha ha
Yall didn't think that I would do it again twice did ya
Ha ha
I do it like that, I put it down
For the 98 or TNT 
Thang ya know what I'm sayin
Timbaland and Twista
Yall fools couldn't recognize could ya?
I put it down for all parts of the area
We out</pre>
