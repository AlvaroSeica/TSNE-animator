[Hook: Block]
Early in the morning, trying to find another club
Cause this one's, bout to close up
Swerving a Suburban, trying to find another club
Cause I'm still trying, to po' up

[Lucky]
I been up two nights, and I'm still going hard
Party nonstop, Lucky living like a star
Why the club close, when a playa having fun
Just killed my last drink, I was about to get crunk
Lil' mama where you from, well what you gon do
Why don't you get your friends, and they all can come too
They gotta qualify though, they gotta be worthy
I'ma give you my number, but holla at me you heard me
Y'all can all come through, if you talking bout something
Pack up in my Suburban, that be sitting on them buttons
When the sun come up, baby girl you gotta go
Get your shoes get your clothes, get your purse and hit the do', it's

[Hook]

[Lucky]
Ahh naw, a playa can't chill
Why them boys, turn on the lights in here
It's two o'clock already, I'm still trying to drink
Bouncer looking at me, like finish that mayn
Iight I'm through, yeah disappear
Trying to find something sexy, so I can get up in her ear
And tell her something thoed, something she never heard
Chop up some real game, and have her like whaat
Nothing to a playa, cause a playa get chose
That's about piece and chain, shoes watches and clothes
I'm a fool boy, it ain't new to the kid
I got one life to live, might as well do it big

[Hook]

[Lucky]
It's 3:30 in the morning, it's still going down
Ten butt naked's in the room, going live
We done hit the spot, parking lot pimping
See how quick, my whip had all of the women
Following us, back to the Telly-elly
I asked her in the lobby, are you sure you're really ready
Cause it's bout to go down, it's some real game spitters
She use to them squares, and never met no real pimp
And I would lace it up, but right now I ain't got time
Only here for my show, what go down
Early in the morn', I gotta catch a damn flight
Come see about me girl, I'm only here for one night
