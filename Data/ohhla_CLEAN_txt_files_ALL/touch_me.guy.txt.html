* Presidential Peter raps MC Hammer style a la "U Can't Touch This"

[Cop]
Hey that's against the law! You're comin with me

[Presidential Peter]
Uhh-uhh-UHH~! Can't touch me
Can't touch me - ju-ju-ju-ju
Just like the bad guy, from Lethal Weapon 2
I've got diplomatic immunity, so Hammer you can't sue
I can write graffiti, even jaywalk in the street
I can riot, loot, not give a hoot
And touch your sister's teat, can't touch me!

[Presidential PG] You can't touch me!
[Mayor Adam West] What in God's name is he doing?
[Presidential PG] You can't touch me!
[Homey Cleveland] I believe that's The Worm
[Presidential PG] STOP, Peter Time!

[Presidential Peter]
I'm a big shot, there's no doubt
Light a fire then pee it out
Don't like it? Kiss my rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump

Can't touch me
Yeah, do the Peter Griffin bump, can't touch me!

[Presidential Peter]
I'm Presidential Peter, interns think I'm hot
Don't care if you're handicapped I'll still park in your spot
I've been around the world, from Hartford to Back Bay
It's Peter, go Peter, MC Peter, yo Peter
Let's see Regis rap this way! Can't touch me

Except for you... you can touch me</pre>
