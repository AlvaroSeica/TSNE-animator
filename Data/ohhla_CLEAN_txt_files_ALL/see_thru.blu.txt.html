[Intro] [Blueprint talking]
On some lo-fi shit. For Columbus you know?
Home of that lo-fi shit. Psychadelic horse shit
 
[Chorus] [x2]
Play victim too much and you'll never be a hero
I would never come to you even if I need you
Sad sad song every time that I see you
Polish up your act because it's see through
 
[Verse One]
You never know who your friends are until it hits the fan
And nothing in your life is going according to plan
Maybe I was trippin' but I thought you was my man
And would help me pick up the pieces when things were out of hand
But, before I can talk about my mess
You flip the script so you can play the damsel in distress
Poor, poor you, the whole world is against you
What are you to do with nobody to defend you?
Everything around you is so out of control
But from what you tellin' me you cause it all on your own
Every once in a while I won't mind
But you pull this type of thing every single time
And by the time I hang up the phone
Damn, I can't even remember why I called
Keep cryin' wolf when the wind blows
And nobody's gonna answer when you need it the most
 
[Chorus] [x2]
Play victim too much and you'll never be a hero
I would never come to you even if I need you
Sad sad song every time that I see you
Polish up your act because it's see through
 
[Verse Two]
Show me somebody who doesn't get called for help 
And I'll show you somebody who's always talkin' about themselves
Like this one chick I knew, so fine, had to have it
Swooped on her, got the number, time to work the magic
I smashed it
But I was still her friend
So we would talk on the phone on the late night to no end
Man, I really like shawty
But every time we talk she had another sob story
Oh you got a headache, your car need new breaks 
You got charged for videos you turned in late
Your baby daddy ain't payin' child support
You failed a drug test and got fired from your job
She was professionally helpless
A lifetime victim
Bringin' on the sympathy of any man that'd listen
Even worse she was materialistic
And had to have the best from her shoes to her lipstick
Went to New York, spent a grand on clothes
Shocked to come home to a disconnected phone
Then had the nerve to ask me for a loan
Actin' like she would die if it wasn't back on
 
[Girl] {Blueprint}
Hey baby how you doin'? {fine}
I really need a loan {word?}
Know that I love you, they turned off my phone {uh huh}
It's really not fair {word?}, I need it back on {really?}
Every time I turn around they be doin' me wrong {yeah right}
 
[Blueprint]
I looked at her like I didn't even know her
And right before I walked away this is what I told her
 
[Chorus] [x2]
Play victim too much and you'll never be a hero
I would never come to you even if I need you
Sad sad song every time that I see you
Polish up your act because it's see through
 
[Outro] [Roger Daltry of The Who speaking]
Just think about the feeling to walk onto a stage
and you got 60,000 people out there and to see you
Adulation from masses of people is power. And it distorts
 
And the adrenaline you get from stage...
it's incredibly good, when it's used.
But if you can't use it, it's incredible destructive</pre>
