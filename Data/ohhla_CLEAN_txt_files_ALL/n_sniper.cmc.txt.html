[Intro: E-A-Ski]
Yeah, these motherfuckers want some funk
I give it to motherfuckin funk
Get this motherfucking glock 17 with an infra red
I'ma put some lead in these punk motherfuckers
Yeah, I'ma do it at night, I'm gonna creep on these muthafuckers
Buck they ass, wassup nigga? Take this!

[Champ MC]
Cruisin down the block in my hoopdie
Cheah, bitches talkin bout they wanna do me
What time of the week will you stop ridin me?
You hottie, you get got by the shottie
Fuck the bullshit and the law
You get even? Call your crew, or better yet, get your homeboy
I don't toy around when it comes to gettin down
Six feet deep is where you bout to rest, underground
But now it's time to go throw in the hoodie
Put on the mask and go looking for the goodies
Pull up to the corner if you think I'm gonna wait by
Well fuck it, I think I'll do a driveby
Just to let a nigga know who the fuck he dealin with
I bust your ass quick cuz I'm on some ol ill shit
I'm swift to jack a bitch from the back cuz I get down like that
Now muthafucka, who's the mack?

[Chorus X3: Champ MC]
Sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper
I'm the neighborhood

[Champ MC]
I step up now to put a brotha in his place
I let the nigga know to stay the fuck out of my face
Because I have a confrontation I gotta keep
I got a for five and I'ma blast you off your feet
I'm rollin deep, so just sleep sucka
You be the next dead nigga layin in the gutta
It's too late to go run to your mami
I feel bad now because you've been caught by the jammie
Fuck it, the leg breaker, here I come, better find your hideout, bitch
Because you don't want none, because I kill, you know the deal
I pass the steel, and I get thrills from all the punks that I kill
You tried to play me, and I don't row that boat
And if I catch your mans slippin, then his ass is out
Cuz I slicing down and pumping holes in your chest
And if you're fucking with me g, then you're fuckin with the best

[Chorus X4]

[Champ MC]
Ain't a damn thang changed, I'm ya neighborhood sniper
The type of crook that catches bodies when I'm hyper
I'm 'Hittin Switches' like that nigga Erick Sermon
I knock you out real fast like George Foreman
You better pick around me because I give the worst beating to the bitches
This is a warning, I'm storming anywhere that I'm not wanted
I blow your brains out ang go get blunted
Think I'm lookin for your wife and your family
I don't laugh at all foo, you can't handle me
Tooken you to the bush, I hope into your window
I heard the wind just before I let the bullet flow
I already blocked shots, relief from the glock
It's in your heart, I'm licking shots throughout the block
Shit, you've been hit by the viper
You best to beware of the neighborhood sniper, word

[Outro: E-A-Ski talking over chorus]
Yeah, it's E-A-Ski &amp; CMT up in this muthafucka
We gon be buckin muthafuckas thats comin around with that bullshit
We snipin all you punk ass bastards
You better break yo self in 1994, cuz it's on, punk ass marks</pre>
