[Intro]
Look I don't care who you are, you could relate to this one.
There's some people in your life for a short season of time and
It's almost better that you bury the memories of them because you've already moved on
And holding on to it just don't make no sense.
Sometimes we go and dig it up like "Just curious"

[Verse 1]
Is it corny if I admit
That I check up on you from time to time when I'm on the net
I promise I ain't no stalker it's so awkward
When I actually come across you I act like I ain't bothered a bit
And you know what that is and I know too
That's pride mixed with lies mixed with "I want you"s
Kinda maybe sorta or the order could be off
Often I wonder if I regret what I lost
At a later time could my state of mind make me blind
I pray it isn't if it was I wouldn't admit it
I thought that I was heading in the right direction
But maybe loneliness has got me second guessing
I got some fly women they follow me on Twitter
I think I'll DM'em alright I'm trippin'
But I'm hard wired for intimacy
So why does my loneliness lead to compromise?
Oh contentment, come quick!

[Chorus]
I'm still curious
Sometimes I'm still
I'm still (curious)
I'm still (curious)
I'm still curious (I think about you)
I'm still (curious)
I'm still (curious)

[Verse 2]
Is it weird it's been a few years
We celebrated the ball droppin' together (cheers)
The stuff you used to wear different products in your hair
When I smell'em in the air I feel like you're somewhere near
Is it me? Is it you? Was it lie? Was it truth?
Maybe it's just nobody's ever good enough for you
OK I swear I'm going through asked my homie what to do
He said, "Boy, listen here 'cause I'm finna tell the truth."
Everybody think about they ex's
Even if you got kids, married to your best friend
In them memories are easily made but hard to forget
Cause they etched up in your heart the good times and regrets
It's curiosity get you in trouble
Specially if it's forbidden kind that you run to
Ah man yeah you're more sensitive then you'll ever admit
So be careful who you make memories with
The secret is to learn what it means to be content
And celebrate what God's given not the things He didn't
Our heart is always longing for more and it wanna bug out
That's why we gotta drink from that water that never run out
But sometimes

[Chorus]
I'm still curious
Sometimes I'm still
I'm still (curious)
I'm still (curious)
I'm still curious (I think about you)
I'm still (curious)
I'm still (curious)

[Hook]
It takes a moment to make memories
A life time to to forget 'em (curious)
That's why I'm still curious
