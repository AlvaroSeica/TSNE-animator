Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
It all started yesterday, and now I can't think about nothing
Is it real, I know this can't be heaven sent
Wish I could dream it all away
And now all I need is a drug
That can help me make it through another day
Maybe it's just me it won't let me be
And I don't really know what it is that keeps bothering me
But I'm saying

[Chorus]
(Why me?)
I wanna know how it is
To see the sun shining
Even when it isn't
(Why me?)
I don't wanna know how it is
To hear me say it's all love when it isn't
(Why me?)
I wanna know how it feels to hear you laughing in my ear
(Why me?)
I don't wanna know how it feels if you didn't cheer

How can he handle this
Too many damages
He hit the nail on the head
But never knew right where the hammer was
Don't think so loud don't let them hear you scream
Baby it's even bigger than it seems

[Verse 2]
Now, now, now crazy is an act alike
Getting better in the after life or maybe not
Maybe I can ask her why the normality passed me by why when I'm a titan
Continue to breathe it dependent on people to get my mental state
Am I meant for this?
The Christian Krizz just have to wait
Pictures getting clearer it ain't me in the mirror
See it's that other nigga only his egos bigger
And he'll pull the tigger when I usually hesitate
And he'll go on 'em when I'm steadly saying wait
Now I'm just a shell of myself
I don't want anybodies help
Maybe I do maybe I do this for you
This is my own hell
Is there a bottle some kind type posion that can end it
A different God I can pray to
Some type of doctor to fix it
Maybe it's just me it won't let me be
And I'm to helpless, I guess

[Chorus]
(Why me?)
I wanna know how it is
To see the sun shining
Even when it isn't
(Why me?)
I don't wanna know how it is
To hear me say it's all love when it isn't
(Why me?)
I wanna know how it feels to hear you laughing in my ear
(Why me?)
I don't wanna know how it feels if you didn't cheer
How can he handle this
Too many damages
He hit the nail on the head
But never knew right where the hammer was
Don't think so loud don't let 'em hear you scream
Maybe it's even bigger than it seems

[Verse 3]
How big is the fight in me
Frightfully fighting night to be day
I'm wishing that wifey would knife me for spiteful things that I say
Excuse me for thinking this way, I'm a little bit pessimistic
They sending blessing this way I guess I must of missed 'em
See my teary eyes through my Ray-Bans
Turning off the world and still looking for some amens
The girlies pee-pee when they see me, fans, they dance
Look in the mirror wanna see me
Here's their chance

[Speaking]
Hope you like what you see
Okay
Hope you like what you see
Why me
