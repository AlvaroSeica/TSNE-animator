Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
Never heard a man speak like this man before
Never heard a man speak like this man before
All the days of my life, ever since I've been before
I've never heard a man, speak like this man before

"I'm goin to a town that has already been burnt down"
"I'm goin to a place that has already been disgraced"
"I'm gonna see some folks who have already been let down"
"I'm so tired..."

Into the jungle (and the beat goes)

[D-Sisive]
Broken glass, everywhere
Blood puddles under broken chairs
My riot, rush the pulpit
While the garbage dive under carpets
We're goin to the stars kid
Believers never die, cobra starship
Ian Curtis, Kurt to Cobain
My quotes bang, yours cannot hang
I got my Zevon on
Ever since I tatted that Z on my arm
I'm on my way to Venus pop
Like E John sang in that "Leave On" song
The poor just drink and sulk
And me, I just don't care at all, so
Maybe the sun will rise tomorrow
But sun won't shine forever so until then

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You know where you are? You're in the jungle baby
And you're gonna die (ha ha ha ha)

[D-Sisive]
Dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
It's all about the money ain't a damn thing funny
Don't laugh at the colors on my canvas, dummy~!
You don't wanna run into Manson, Bundy
Trust me, I'm from another planet Cuddy
So dope boy West, Mannie Fresh, Dougie
Lights out lost in the land of the ugly
Clint Howard, man in the mirror
Make 'em make 'em clap hands up to the ceiling
Speedwagon, "Can't Fight This Feeling"
Forgot what I started fighting for to begin with
The poor just drink and sulk
And me, I just don't care at all, so
Maybe the sun will rise tomorrow
But sun won't shine forever so until then

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
