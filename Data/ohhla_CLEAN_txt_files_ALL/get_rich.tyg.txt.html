[Intro]
Have it, you really gotta have it!

[Chorus]
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars at the crib, gotta have it
Uh, and this is something for your bad bitch
One time I'm a show you how to get rich!
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars at the crib, gotta have it
Uh, and this is something for your bad bitch
One time I'm a show you how to get rich!
Uh, show you how to get rich
Uh, show you how to get rich
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars ant the crib, gotta have it!

Auggh, I ain't fucking with no plane Janes
Getting head on the plane, call it head space
Uh, need legs space, making me shake
She will twerk it all night, she will need a break!
Uh, got... the big bang
Trade hoes like... need a coach name
T frog game, nigga last king
Nigga hating cause I'm balling, telling more shame
Rack city, triple ex to the mill, baby
Used to be balling, now I'm Bill Gating.
Hater shot bitch cause I'm inpatient
Live your life like a king and it's so amazing!

[Chorus]
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars at the crib, gotta have it
Uh, and this is something for your bad bitch
One time I'm a show you how to get rich!
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars at the crib, gotta have it
Uh, and this is something for your bad bitch
One time I'm a show you how to get rich!
Uh, show you how to get rich
Uh, show you how to get rich
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars ant the crib, gotta have it!

Uh, 9th grade used to play hokey
Told your bitch I'll pass when I drop pussy
I don't need your pussy, I get too much pussy
Fucked her in the kitchen, kept a full cooking.
Uh, 22 young millionaire crib in Bel Air, all the bitches stare
... you should cup a pair
No house phone cause I'm never fair!
I fucked her best friend and I saw love
Cause I get her best friends all in the club
Niggas pulled up, bitches all drugged
And now she wanna do it is fuck with a twag.

[Chorus]
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars at the crib, gotta have it
Uh, and this is something for your bad bitch
One time I'm a show you how to get rich!
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars at the crib, gotta have it
Uh, and this is something for your bad bitch
One time I'm a show you how to get rich!
Uh, show you how to get rich
Uh, show you how to get rich
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars ant the crib, gotta have it!
It's so amazing!
Living life like a king is so amazing!</pre>
