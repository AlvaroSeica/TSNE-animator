[Intro - Pharrell]
Yo! It's money time! Yeah!
Yezzir... Ho! Hey, hey!

[Chorus - Pharrell]
I'm tryna stuff 'em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle
All the ho-oh-oes, screaming "ho-oo-oh!"
That nigga go, go for the goal

[Verse 1 - Big Sean]
Okay, B-I, B-I, bitch I do it to death
If I come in with half, bet I leave with the rest
OK, you might be cool getting 50%
And I'm like, "fuck you doing? I need Diddy percent!"
Got a million on line one, and another mil' dialing in
Momma on line four, telling me how much not to spend
'Ye on line three, telling me how we about to win
You on hold, tryna get conferenced in (Boi)
I just, I just gotta have it, imagined and
Make it happen, I prayed about it and grabbed it
My life is a fucking movie, the baddest bitches get casted
I'm in a race with myself to see, who could get it the fastest
HUH, sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check Wit no ink - I get it

[Chorus - Pharrell]
I'm tryna stuff 'em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle
All the ho-oh-oes, screaming "ho-oo-oh!"
That nigga go, go for the goal, hey
Get it, get it, nigga we gon' get it
Get it, get it, nigga you could get it
Get it, get it, nigga I can get
Yeah, yeah, my nigga we gon' get it

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
Whoa! The sky never seemed so low
Looking at a life you've never seen so close
I had a dream about a trillion in cash, it's time to make it happen
I'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine
Talking cash, that you got to fake a accent
I've broke enough tree down that I could make a cabin
Look - I turn all my problems to ash
All my wants into haves and then divided by half
Pass it on to my man, write my will out then
Pass it on to my fam, and finally become a man
I had a dream I was greatest of all time
Greatest of all Big's, and greatest of all Sean's
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check Wit no ink - I get it

[Chorus - Pharrell]
I'm tryna stuff 'em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle
All the ho-oh-oes, screaming "ho-oo-oh!"
That nigga go, go for the goal, hey
Get it, get it, nigga we gon' get it
Get it, get it, nigga you could get it
Get it, get it, nigga I can get
Yeah, yeah, my nigga we gon' get it
Let's go...</pre>
