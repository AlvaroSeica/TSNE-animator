[Intro/Chorus: MC Eiht]
Death Wish, the Death Wish
Death Wish, the Death Wish
Death Wish, the Death Wish (*Gun shots*)
Death Wish, the Death Wish (*Multiple gun shots*)

[Verse One: MC Eiht]
You better scatter Quick cause you know you can't hang
With The Eiht, get it straight cause I'm dropping these gangster things
Lock your doors, run and hide
Can't nothing save you when the Eiht Hype who-rides
Peep, I'm putting clowns to sleep
Ready to put my working on the fool whose talk is too cheap
You shouldn't have made that tape that you pushed me
The brother with the perm whose schemey as worm
Mmmm... you ready for round one? - Here it come fool
I got my blunt in my hand, come and get some
Damn, I'm tired of this cold rap getting pesos
Sorry little amigo, screaming like a sorry whore
Hold Up! your happy sound, prancing around
Nothing but a sorry clown, stay the hell down!
Damn! you know you can't fuck with this
Geah, first step is your Death Wish

[Chorus: MC Eiht]

[DJ Premier] We're gonna get to the good part..

[Verse Two: MC Eiht]
So you know it's the part when the Eiht start
With the routine, it's the same song
Peel another cap (*Gun Shot*) now what's going on?  
Geah, Tick-itty tock, you don't stop
Fool, you hear a click, I bust your chops
Right, no future, in your fronting
Smoke your butt like I'm blazing up a blunt
Damn! I hate you punk
Cause you'll never equal, the Death Wish sequel
Tell me can you fade that black
Or get slung like a fifty-pack
Yeah, so it's the second call to all sorry
Whack MCs that's out like Atari
Geah boy you can get the fist
Ummm.. one more Death Wish

[Break: MC Eiht]
Ummm.. Gyeah

[Verse Three: MC Eiht]
Last verse; fools what's up? 
Ready to rat-pack, N.O.T.R. got my back
And I'm ready to bust a head or two or three
Try to come deal with E - gyeah
So gain weight, as I grab them, I did stick 
Busting your grill, when I kill cause you're just another victim
So when I step you better keep your hands on your grip
Don't trip when I flip or get a fat lip
A brother from the city where it don't stop
And you just might drop when the nine pop (*Gun Shot*) 
And jack is my specialty G
Quick, fast to mack once and take your money
Geah, I'm down for the crew
Just like the freaks we gots to get paid too
I knock you out and when your punk-butt come through
You'll realize it was a nightmare of Death Wish, two

[Outro: MC Eiht]
Gyeah, gyeah! Compton is definitely in the house for the 93 shot
N.O.T.R. and we send them out the Death Wishes
To all the fools down town
My man Premier, take me out of here
