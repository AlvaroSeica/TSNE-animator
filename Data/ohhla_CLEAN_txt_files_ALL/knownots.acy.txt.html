and we about to tell y'all what it's all about
so as i ease back from this microphone
i'm a let it go to Aceyalone

Chorus:

check it out people whoever you are
whoever you with where ever you at
where ever you from where ever you goin
i'm 'on' put you up on this here cause youse not knowin

Verse One:

let me take a little time out to holler at ya
you go get your partners cause i'm fit to drop a bug in your ear
see what we have here is uh ruh  yeah
the helluva ill type shit you fear
that's cause we knowin but you don't really know
cause every nigga that call hisself rappin don't really flow
really though
i'll open up my mind and take you places you can't go
i woulda been a catcher behind the plate but you can't throw
cause you don't know but you don't hear me though
yo check this out
my body collapse in the raps 
and snaps like a wild mongoose in a trap
better watch your table manners boy and give me room
i'm servin' shit constantly tune
and laughin' like a ticklish babboon
on the way to the moon w/a stick and a broom
and the cream of the crop hip hop cause we be
crackin' the whip on the poppin' be pimpin' the whole punk block
at the junk shop
Fellowship shop shape sha-bob-a-lob-a
sloppin' the side of a pig pen with the grape ape babboon
wanna see this jack o'lantern panted planted ball that don't bounce
against the wall like you think
well thanks but no thanks
pranks or no pranks
i'm a let 'em know they can't rank bank or no bank
i would if i could but i can't so i ain't gon' stop flowin'
but i'll put you up on this here cause you's not knowin'

damn Acey flay me he kinda hittin' i ain't bullshittin'
written into the Fellowship you know freestyle
meanwhile back at the hall of justice
Abstract bust this this track ain't for suckers

Verse Two: Abstract Rude

immediately exceeding the reality of normality
by radically and automatically startin' off rapidly
rap w/me
come on perk a little work a little
in the middle nuclei we are responding
stimuli dim the lights
i gotta really grab you
cause you just not knowin' about flowin' i can climax to
you rap too short too long too slow too fast
you lacks on point you wrong you won't last
i'm up on a good foot you're out on a bad note
i'm dope 
ice
fresh 
automatic oh yes
creatively talkin' about how i'm fadin' you vocally
your mouth's not openin' man you just not knowin' damn

these niggas got me fucked up aw what up Abstract Rude
rap dude ain't nobody fade the fresh coast
you know them Heavyweights you know what i'm sayin'
that Ganja K you know what i'm sayin'
that Dolla Holla comin' w/that Watts up you know what i'm sayin'
it's like i ain't even tryin' to understand why people comin' at me
w/that nonsense 
they ain't knowin'

Verse Three: Aceyalone

see i engineered it i geared it i steered it
i took it to the whole world and everybody cheered it
i hauled it i yes y'all'ed it and they feared it
i called it i outlawed it and they cleared it
now i am i and it is it and that's that
but ain't that a bitch
it ain't shit
think it ain't all that that they say
forever and a day 
to live and die in L.A.
california u.s.a.
but i am a universal soldier
ok
walkin' through the party tryin' to find my way
bumped into my main man Ganja K
i gave a nigga a pound and he lit up a j
i took a hit and a half and got high and a hey
my coconut was mellow but my vision was gray
looked on the dance floor and i seen my DJ
Cool Hands Kiilu Grand he knows what to play
so we headed for the booth to get the party on the way
walkin' through the crowd i heard somebody say hey
it was Mikah 9 he said what up double A
tryin' to make my pay tryin' not to stray
but you know my forte i let a sleepin' dog lay

we on that old missin' link 
in between the baboon and the common man
they don't understand tho 
they ain't even tryin' to know
check this out

Verse Four: Mikah 9

I and I echo with old sentiments
rudimentary tenements
house reverberates
richochets to small invertebrates
even all these spineless jellyfish
rhyme-less bass with no taste jazz
enthusiastic spastic hemophiliacs
memorabilia or acting siliac sense(less)milia
minature expenditures
spine tingling adventures
keenly architechtures 
of a lecture
that blockade and bust dental caps and dentures
hey! let's start a new business venture
no you're not dreaming i'll be the pincher
the millimeter by millimeter doberman boombastic mix
where rotweiller while a rhyme of
graffiti traffic autobiographic
ethnic cleansing benzing lacing
culture oscars inch by inch Deans and Costners
who foster my rhythmic memories
collectible sacks of my Mossberg and telebeam
scope enemies with enemas 
i'm leaving them helpless and hopeless like the
running victim that falls in the scary cinema

huh huh it was like three black guys and they like had skills
yeah skills
they were like kinda kinda funky and fresh and stuff

yeah nigga you just not knowin'
