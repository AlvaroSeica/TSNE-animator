V.A. dirty south, dirty south

what, what ... project shit what

[Timberlake]
I know you see me looking girl go on and act right
A lil' closer let me see you in the spot light
Now turn around and let me see just what you curve like
Gonna grab your friends and y'all can come to the back oooh

Why don't you take a sip up on this champagne
Relax, take ya coat off, and let me getcha name
I love that hour glass shape you got up on that frame
I like the way you talk ya game we mite be one and the same

Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol
I got a house that can entertain all a y'all
Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call
About to slide out but I'll get back at ya ooh
And when I call don't give me the runaround
I ain't gonna have ya try ta have you play me like a silly clown
Don't second guess it girl there ain't nothing to think about
Because girl you got me fiendin' but girl ya don't hear me

[Chorus]
Little lady {lady lady}
You got me just {screwed up}
Off of your melody
Little lady {lady lady}
Come on and don't {chop me up}
Please don't make a fool of me

Little lady {lady lady}
You got me just {screwed up}
Off of your melody
Easy baby {baby baby}
Come on girl don't {chop me up}
Please don't make a fool of me

[Timberland]
Ya kinda cute baby are you new in town
My name is Timb aka Thomas Crown
I heard ya lost do you know your way around
If ya got a problem baby I could hold you down {ohhh}
I can be ya navigator or ya compass
Better yet a genie baby make ya first wish
You the party baby I'm just the guest list
I think I need some tylenol you got me restless

So grab ya friends and let's take ya back to my house
Lets watch sex in the city or desperate housewives
Simon says touch your's while you touch mine
{Parental discretion is advised} {ohhh}

Y'all could be the star in my ficky spot light
Studio fifty four if we get the props right
All we need right now is a little bit little bit of act right
Y'all lookin shy but y'all act like y'all don't hear me

[Chorus]
Little lady {lady lady}
You got me just {screwed up}
Off of your melody
Little lady {lady lady}
Come on and don't {chop me up}
Please don't make a fool of me

Little lady {lady lady}
You got me just {screwed up}
Off of your melody
Easy baby {baby baby}
Come on girl don't {chop me up}
Please don't make a fool of me

[DJ Paul]
See girl you are stronger then the strongest drug I ever had
you can mix 'em all together you would still be twice as bad
Cause you're the worst best girlfriend I ever had
Harder to quit, the cigarettes and green bags
Harder to escape the jail cells and bills
Yeah ya you had me lost since the minute gurl and pig tails
Like Michael Jackson, how you do me this way
Got me cryin rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake

[Juicy J]
They call me Juicy J, straight up out the Three 6 Mafiaa
Ghetto fab playa all these freaks I'm trynna hollatcha
Quit playin games gurl you got my head spinnin round
I ain't gon chirp ya mobile phone and chase you all over town
I just wanna pick you up and take you to a bachelor nest
Is it good, is it good
And have a lil smack fest
So if you never call me ill be sumwhere down and Tennessee
Washin away my sorrows in cold cup a Hennessy

[Chorus]
Little lady {lady lady}
You got me just {screwed up}
Off of your melody
Little lady {lady lady}
Come on and don't {chop me up}
Please don't make a fool of me

Little lady {lady lady}
You got me just {screwed up}
Off of your melody
Easy baby {baby baby}
Come on girl don't {chop me up}
Please don't make a fool of me

Screwed up
Chop me up
Screwed up
Off of ya melody</pre>
