[Verse 1]
I aint never paid no chick to thrust
Me, I never paid no woman to help me bust
Me, I never needed no other chick to clutch
Cuzz nina was living hella matrimony
Its a must
Never ever payed and came with lust
My aims for trust
Cuzz my womans pain is enough
Dont want my marrige ending stranger then us
But just here recently
My brains corrupt
One night my niggaz took me to the strip club
Bazookas
Everybody know the name of the kinda shit I'm use ta
Seduca, so that means there was no clothes
Got my eyes open wide
Like I'm on No Doz
Look at these bozos
Givin double 0's for hoe shows
I was cool
I was drinkin my juice
Wasnt really in the mood
Till I was approached by a beautiful angel
In the nude
But I flipped my top
When she sat that butter skin on my lap
I was shocked
Lips locked
Feelin like my heart stopped
She was hot!
She was Carmen Electra in the chest
Alliya by the waist
Jennifer Lopez in the ass
But she was an angle in the face
She asked me if I wanted to dance on the couch
WIth the look of a zombie
I reached into my pouch
And shelled it out
Then she took my hand
And led me to the land
Where a man could forget about all his problems at
hand
The scent of a woman
She wearing shenell, hypnotized by the smell
A glimpse of hell and bodily melt down
Is what I felt now
I cam with 500
Tryin to keep it all
But she want it
At the ATM to get 4 more
Thats for you and me, now bitch lets go
Hevenly cant descibe this woman
Beyond that, I feel the area bump and grind
Like combat
No penetration
Its funny
She didnt kiss me or fuck me
But got away with all my money
S.H.E.

[Chorus - repeat 4X]
Took everything that I had
Made me want sex hella bad!

[Verse 2]
The next day my wifes checking the account
She said your only bringing 4,000 a month
So last night you spent 1,00 on what?
A new piece of equipment
For the studio
But she wont ever really know
That I spent it on another nude show
I close my self in the bathroom
Lean over the stool
And grabbed my middle section tight
Thinkin about the way she made me feel that night
I had alot of fun
Then I got one, and another one, and another one
I went back that night, and the next night
Repeated here I come
Wife pissed cuzz I depleted all our funds
She left me and moved back with her moms
Im borrowing money from all my homies
I know that I'm wrong
But this bitch was the bomb
Im paying the bills at bazookas
I slip my finger through her g-sting
It was tight
She told the bouncers
Now I'm in a fist fight
You put on how you love me
And how you like it rough like me
All these motherfuckers and your man
Cant love you enough like me
I lost my life for you, my wife for you
I miss you
So I'm sitting outside the club every night for you
Thats right for you, shit

[Chorus] - 6 times

(Seductive Human Erotica!) - 5x HAHAHAHA</pre>
