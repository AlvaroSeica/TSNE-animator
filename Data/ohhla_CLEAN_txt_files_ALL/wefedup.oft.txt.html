[Chorus: FlipSide]
No justice no peace, niggas grab your heat
Meet me in the streets, we about to kill this beast
No justice no peace, niggas grab your heat
Meet me in the streets, we about to kill this beast

(We fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up,
We fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up)

Put your hood on, put your hood on, put your hood on
Put you hood on

[Verse 1: Devey2G]
I'm Sick And Tired of being sick and tired
Police crooked the politicians liars
Locked and loaded I swear I'm ready to fire
Locked and loaded I swear I'm ready to fire
Rest in peace Trayvon Martin
Another black man laying in the coffin
In other words just another target
Forget marching we did enough talking
Stand for something and don't fall for this
Fed up with this government
First offense we're going straight to the Pen
They don't judge us they judge us by our skin
Give us more than ten a whole life sentence
Young brother couldn't even write a sentence
Murder Murder kill kill
Man it's messed up this whole thing is senseless

[Chorus: FlipSide]
No justice no peace, niggas grab your heat
Meet me in the streets, we about to kill this beast
No justice no peace, niggas grab your heat
Meet me in the streets, we about to kill this beast

(We fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up)(x2)

Put your hood on, put your hood on, put your hood on

[Verse 2: Low MB]
Know we the nieborhood watchers
Walk the street with our choppers
And we don't need no coppers
To justify our popers
Y'all violatin our civil rights
The reason why we don't sleep at night
Postin on your web site
Fascinated with that black life
If you see that fool George Zimmerman
Walkin down your street again
Stalk his ass call 9-1-1
Then pop his ass with a legal gun
When the cops come
Tell them take it to trial
Self defense it was justified bring
The judge bring the jury read the verdict
I'm not guilty!

[Chorus: FlipSide]
No justice no peace, niggas grab your heat
Meet me in the streets, we about to kill this beast
No justice no peace, niggas grab your heat
Meet me in the streets, we about to kill this beast

(We fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up)(x2)

Put your hood on, put your hood on, put your hood on

[Verse 3: FlipSide]
We love in kind people
To people to that treat us equally
We Non volet people
This voice speak for the people
But violent to the people
That violent to our people
We tried to do it legal
Y'all lied to the people
Connive-in in y'all evil
Now we occur pine with or people
I stand here with a heater
Time to be leader
Second at men let use
It bare arm lets do I
We Fed up to the fullest
Ill take first shot in first bullets!

(We fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up)(x2)

[Chorus: FlipSide]
No justice no peace, niggas grab your heat
Meet me in the streets, we about to kill this beast
No justice no peace, niggas grab your heat
Meet me in the streets, we about to kill this beast

(We fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up, we fed up)(x2)

Put your hood on, put your hood on, put your hood on</pre>
