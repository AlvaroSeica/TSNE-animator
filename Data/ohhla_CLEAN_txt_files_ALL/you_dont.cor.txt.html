Guerilla war nigga, what
Guerilla war nigga, what what (4x)

It's on..
Ya'll niggaz don't know the art of war
Now you dyin and my gun'll keep burstin, till yo' mama cryin
I defy your whole crew, ya'll niggaz weak
It could be on officially, if you had heart
Nigga you overrated, props old decayin
Not known for sprayin, what the fuck you sayin?
Your crew fell, you jail cuz mine doin it
Yo, quit the jealousy, and get to felonies
My niggaz sellin ki's, you niggaz sellin dreams
Your plans ain't precise, you need better schemes
Cuz yo, I ain't tryin to lose another nigga
And if so, enough blood'll spill to fill a river
And I'll part the sea like Moses' staff
And smite my enemies, despite the penalties
You can live like king, but die from injuries
You about to be a memory, nigga YOU DON'T WANT IT
I don't hate you, I despise you
I call you cocksucker, cuz it describes you
I know you wish you had a real crew, like I do
Niggaz who send shots to get props like my crew
Look at you, nigga you had status
Most of that vanished, ya'll niggaz have been addicts
Unestablished, what the fuck happened?
You had the block cliquein, now you denial ya'll, I finish
You opposition but you no competition to my niggaz
With heaters yo, we not feelin you either, what?
You wanna talk violent, with ?sick piece? for solution
I stalk silent, when I proceed execution
Talk by the, realest niggaz to what they plannin
Who once thought you vanished, like a corps remainin
You on the Ave with your weak mens frontin
When you see my niggaz comin, YOU DON'T WANT IT
My nigga Biggie must have prophecised (uh!)
When he says somebody gotta die
I'm like Doc Jekyll when I attack you, down from jab wounds
Frank Nitty couldn't do it that smooth
Life's a bitch, I'm the pimp, ?your old man do's you?
I proved you weak, you ride dick to eat
You ain't real, ill, or prepared to kill
Man you better chill, you could get it for real
I live this life of gangstas, every second in danger
The enemy is really a stranger
The treachery in our hearts' a man and jealousy's best friend
That's the reason felonies'll never end
How you feel is neutral
I don't feel retaliation, I'm shootin you
This is a main evaluation I do with you too scared to do
Muthafucka, I'm prepared, YOU DON'T WANT IT nigga</pre>
