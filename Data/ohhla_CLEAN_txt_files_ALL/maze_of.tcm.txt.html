Danger, danger
has got me stepping like a Power Ranger
calling on the power of the One from the manger
in anger, but not in sin
I begin to make my way thru all of this mess I'm in
It's hard to see so many born faster
got hate oozing out'em like sulfuric acid
everyday a new thief
today's, might want my teeth
to string them all together and make'em into a wreath
Brother's ill, and won't think twice· to shake his boom pipe
even if I run the jewels, he'll still want my life
Puppy's sick
gotta shoot the gospel quick
and hope the truth will hit him much harder than a mule kick
I let him know that if he lets the hollow points spray
God's got a vengeance that'll make a flamb?
But let me shut up before I provoke the "cack, cack!"
wish I could do a kick and put him on his back
not to make him handicapped
but so that I could get away
and have another chance to pray
that this brother would get out of the Maddness

[Chorus]
What do you do when life's a must
but you already caught the rush
money, power, lust
In whom will you place your trust
All sin, no question, no doubt
Stuck and you can't get out
Christ knows how you feel
So get'em up in the air if you know He's real!

Caution, caution has got me turnin', tossin' pausin'
six million moves, Steve Austin
Check the picture
here comes that madd, fly, dime sister
guess she's sittin' waiting for her loving money Mr
I wonder if she's got time to hear the plan
I see her lips say "Her comes this corny preacher man"
I try to strike one up, I say, "That skirt is fly, is it pleated?"
She said, "Man beat it!"
I said "Why is that the greeting that I'm given?"
She said "Step!", I said "God Bless your soul and keep livin' "
And as I walk away
I wish there was something I could say
to really make her understand that she's more than a Chick-fila'
Piece of meat to be bought or sandwich to be made
cause a little mayonnaise won't change how your played
Cause the next man bites
and the next man bites
and when it's all over it's a terrible sight
Cause when they are done pulling up everything, man it's spooky
You got substance, but float around the bowl
and God's got a flush for all the manure
that's why I'm trying to tell her, to keep her out of the sewer
of the Maddness

[Chorus]

Power, power
has got me lasting for another hour
trying to stay alert, awake to the devourer
Though his fate must drag on
The Dragon, Satan
been hawking to destroy me ever since I was a little man
And even though I know I'm sealed for the long ride
he tempts me to feel the pleasure of the dark side
It gets raw hide in obeying God's will
the power is in steady spittin'
"It's Written"
in his lying grill
And if he wasn't enough to shake roll and rattle
the world is another enemy of constant battle
They invite me in, only to disown me
build me up to brake me down, till I'm lonely
Lastly I war with myself the most
Today will I play dictator or will I play host
Will I do what I hate
or hate what I do
or don't do what I should· or deny what I know is true
This is the ceaseless, keeping it real, kinda war
not only am I a conqueror but I'm more
So tell my three enemies that God's got the back of his buddy
So I'm going to my grave with my knucks (Knuckles) bloody
Not in the physical, but in a spiritual kinda baddness
cause I gotta fight the Maddness

[Chorus]</pre>
