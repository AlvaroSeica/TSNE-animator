[Raheem DeVaughn]
Send a message to God in heaven
Tell Him, I'm thankful to be alive
Cause you sleep from 11 to 7
And work hard from 9 to 5
Cause can't nobody last forever
And everybody has to die
And everybody needs protection
I pray it don't pass me by

[Chorus]
Cause everybody needs an angel
And everybody needs to smile
And everybody has an angle
And everybody wants tomorrow right now

[Raheem DeVaughn]
Some say that happiness will never find you
Until you find yourself
Some say that happiness is all around you
It ain't how you measure your wealth, no
I say it's free to be yourself
We all fall short sometimes
It costs nothing...
It costs nothing to help sometimes

[Chorus]</pre>
