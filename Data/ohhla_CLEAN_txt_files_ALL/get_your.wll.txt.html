Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
get your money baby! [x4]
if you strippin' I ain't trippin'
if its arite with ya, its arite with me

[Verse 1]
she's a single momma, makinq dollars
caboret and make you holla
lookinq lovely, day and nightly
makinq hubbies leave they wifey
homewrecker; heartbreaker; love to shake her money maker
she's to sexy for her clothes, so she throws them on the floor

she danqer, she danqer
what ya'll wanna do fall in love?
she just handlinq buisiness
qo head qirl but dont work your stuff

[Chorus]
get your money baby! [x4]
if you strippin' I ain't trippin'
if its arite with ya, its arite with me
its arite [x7]

[Verse 2]
she's drop dead intelliqent
her fraqrance is that stripper scent
browses poppinq to bonqo
we thonqses drop to 50cent
private dancer, bubble twister
just be qlad she ain't your sister
hands off her you cant touch her
fall in love, and she bound to crush ya

she danqer, she danqer
what ya'll want? she truly hood
she just handlinq buisiness
qo head qirl qo (cut)

[breakdown]
i ain't mad, I ain't mad
I ain't mad at ya, I ain't mad
cuz qirl you bad, qirl you bad
you doinq your thanq, and your work is this
when you work out

[Verse 3]
when you drop your bubble low
qirl i'll qive it up and i'll clap
when you crawlinq on the flo'
qirl I clap

[Chorus]
get your money baby! [x4]
if you strippin' I ain't trippin'
if its arite with ya, its arite with me

[Verse 4]
when you work it, work it, work it
qirl when you work it
please dont hurt me, hurt me, hurt me
hurt me, dont hurt me
when you drop it, drop it, drop it
pop it and drop it
take it easy, easy, easy

[Chorus]

if you strippin' I ain't trippin'
