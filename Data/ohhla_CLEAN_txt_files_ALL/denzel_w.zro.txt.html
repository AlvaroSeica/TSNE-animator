Don't try to knock the hustle, cause you just wasting your time
I'm cooler, than Denzel Washington with mine
I know I'm a playa, (I know I'm a playa)
I know I'm a money making playa, so playa
Don't try to knock the hustle, cause you just wasting your time
I'm cooler, than Denzel Washington with mine
I know I'm a playa, (I know I'm a playa)
I know I'm playa so you haters, you're just wasting your time
 
[Chamillionaire]
I keep the wallet with the wads, so I'm riding with the noise
Plus the clip is fully loaded, as the inside of my garage (cars)
Look at all my broads, if you're trying to see the stars
Find me, and you gon' feel like you done found your way to Mars
Keep the paper punctuated, yeah that's the new philosophy
A G I gotta be, on top of that like an apostrophe
Fame must of got to me, confidence has got to be
I autographed myself, write a check and make it out to me
Beggers can't be choosers, go and get a ruler
Chain extra long, like Wilt Chamberlain's majula
Other known as Koopa, ain't nobody cooler
Brain is a thang, then she love to be my tutor
She loving my cologne, recognize the odor
Must of smelled money, Ben Franklin's what I told her
Pistol I'm a toter, big swangas on my roller
So they talking about my money, in the city like promotors hol' up

[Z-Ro]
I'm a thug so, my criminal record ain't clean
That's why I'm paranoid, around police
I'ma superstar, but I'm still street
I got the gun under my seat, so don't agitate me
In the blink of an E-Y-E, you will become a memory mayn
I will never have my gun on safety
Cause I been feeling the strangest feeling lately
(chasing money, you know them haters hate it)
The 300 is cool, but I want Mercedes
It ain't nothing fraudulent about me
Five-deuce, Hoover C-R-I-P
(and can't no woman, get no money out of me)
Unless it's Grandma Dorothy, or Auntie
I still represent S.U.C.
(and I'ma hold it down, for Chamilitary)
When I meet up with 2Pac, and Pimp C
And when I'm gone, they gon' still remember me

My grill got stripes, and my belt got notches
From I-10 grinding, now the money stacked in boxes
The block is obnoxious, the boppers on ball sacks
Haters trying to start shit, like duck-a-lacs
Skin covered all up in tats, dead presidents powder stacks
Haters dress like jumping jacks, if you getting money congrats
See me, I grind hard no break dance
Till they get us, we got scripts like a movie cast
I rep my city my hood, and my block
And I'm representing Texas, till they lay me in that box
Knots on paper stacking, and candy apple red
I'm a playa with mine, but I get gangsta bout my bread don't try to trip
