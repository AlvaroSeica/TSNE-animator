[Chorus: Dice Raw] 
I'm a side of suicide: heads or tails
Some think life is livin hell
Some live life just livin well
I live life tryna tip the scale 
my way, my way
my way, my way
 
[Black Thought]
Yo, I'm always early, I never take off 
'cause I got a job: rob Peter to pay Paul
Now I realize it's the winner that takes all
Do what I gotta do, because I can't take loss
Picture me livin life as if I'm some animal
that consumes its own dreams like I'm a cannibal
I won't accept failure, unless it's mechanical
But still the alcohol, mixed with the botanical
I guess I be referred to the owner's manual full of loaners
Full of all the homeless throwaways and the stoners
Soldiers of the streets with 8th grade diplomas
and the world awaitin their shoulders as a bonus
Look, let he without sin live without sin
Until then, I'll be doing dirty jobs like Swamp Men
Countin the faces of those that might have been
It's like, livin that life but I won't live that life again
 
[Chorus]
 
[Dice Raw] 
Lotta niggaz go to prison, how many come out Malcolm X?
I know I'm not... shit, can't even talk about the rest
Famous last words: You under arrest
Will I get popped tonight? It's anybody's guess
I guess, a nigga need to stay cunning
I guess when the cops coming need to start runnin
I won't make the same mistakes from my last run-in
You either done doin crime now or you done in
I got a brother on the run and one in
Wrote me a letter he said, "When you comin?"
Shit, man, I thought the goal's to stay out
Back against the wall, then shoot your way out
Gettin money's a style that never plays out
'til you in a box and your stash money's paid out
The scales of justice ain't equally weighed out
Only two ways out: diggin tunnels or diggin graves out
 
[Chorus]</pre>
