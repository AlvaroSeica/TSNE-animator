Gotta make this money
Gotta make this money
This money is me
This money is everything I do and see
Who are you to judge me
Just let me be - and let me breathe
I see this whole world headed for damnation
And I'm ready to leave
I can't believe this whole world twisted me
You fuckin' biggets, you fakes, you wanna-be's
I see the future and its lookin' grim
A lake of fire lookin' like a gonks whip

Chorus:
I'ma fist of rage (one foot in the grave)
I'ma fist of rage (far from saved)
I'ma fist of rage (in a broken state)
(I'ma razor blade slippin' thru a bale of hay)
I'ma fist of rage! x4
Crack another bottle and let me knock one back

Huh-huh, Slim Jim's
And the tin men grins
Fat heads with dreads
And all the feds growing shark fins
Huh-huh, my girls knocked up
We're in love but she's young and I think I'm being locked up
I couldn't cut the mustard with a Ginsu
And a twist of brown for all the bullshit I been thru
I'm looking for love but it's got too many dam faces
I can't win even with these four aces
My place is here with the mix and the tricks and sickos
I spend g's but only make nickels
My soul tickles
But this ain't even fun and games
My heart bleeds from the pleasures of the pain
My fuse is short and its lit like me I'm short
It's sketchy
It's getting hard to see
My heart bleeds believe it every dying breath
These people take and they take
Until theres nothing left

Chorus

Ya feeling bold with me
Your up a creek
And you don't know it
Finger on the trigger but your punk ass is scared to pull it
And I know it
Cause the fear you hide your eyes show it
Payback on your ass cause I know I owe it
Now when your goin' down bet I'll be blowing up
Hear the sound of a shotgun cock and know you're fucked
I hope you see my middle finger from the stage
(Coming - Come and feel me x4)
