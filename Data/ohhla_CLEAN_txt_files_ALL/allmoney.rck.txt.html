You know Get Money?
Becoming the young Chamillionaire
Good sight of the things that is important to him
OLYMPICS
I'd never trade my old girl for all the money in the world
I'd never trade my daughter Toya for all the money in the world
I'd never trade my only boy for all the money in the world
I put my last name first!
I can hear my Daddy saying, "Lil' nigga go get 'em!"
Passed in '99 cancer all up in his liver
Shit- difference is now (his?) son's a lil richer
I'd never rap again if I could tell him that I miss him
Why the fuck I own the world when I can't share it with him?
Bust his ass, so I just want to break bread with him
Crying in my mansion as I'm holdin on his picture
It's a golden moment world, I'm flyin' solo on you niggas
Being the only boy = definition of a man
All the money is the world still not a big enough as his
Still all the money in the world still not big enough as his
For me to turn my back on me being the man that I am
Turn off the lights (Turn on the lights)
Take a ride with me. (Take a ride with me.)
I wanna see you smile (I wanna see you smile)
It's a fantasy (It's a fantasy)
La La LaLa Laa (La La LaLa Laa)
La La LaLa (La La LaLa)
La La LaLa Laa (La La LaLa Laa)
La La LaLa (La La LaLa)
Momma gettin older feelin pains in her shoulder
I gotta stay focused and remain a little soldier
Brace a few wishfuls and the streets begin the whisper
Praying for you niggas still stocking up my pistols
Lil nigga getting murdered and buried in all white
8th grade school you all thinking it's alright
Trying to figure out where I'm going with my life
As I'm stepping on the brake and hangin' a sharp right
Did my thing in the streets, seen in the streets see me at the park on the
swing with my niece
Watch chipped up, still won't switch up
First damn thing, and so you gotta turn that bitch up
Turn off the lights (Turn on the lights)
Take a ride with me (Take a ride with me)
I wanna see you smile (I wanna see you smile)
It's a fantasy (It's a fantasy)
La La LaLa Laa (La La LaLa Laa)
La La LaLa (La La LaLa)
La La LaLa Laa (La La LaLa Laa)
La La LaLa (La La LaLa)
Oh Man- When I close my eyes I can see you about a million times
Its true over and over (over and over)
Yea- I did it again, it kinda makes me laugh
cause you're the one that put me on this map
I guess I gotta keep moving strong
I feel like I can't go wrong
(Because I can hear you talking with me
I can hear you talking to me
I know you hear them saying LaLa La La Laa Â–
La La LaLa Laa (La La LaLa Laa)
La La LaLa (La La LaLa)
La La LaLa Laa (La La LaLa Laa)
La La LaLa (La La LaLa)
Come and take a ride with me
I really wanna take a walk wit' you
It'd be cool to have a drink with you, think with you.. take a ride with meee
There's so much to say, old memories wont go away.. go away.. go away.. go away.. 
(yea yea yea yea)
Old memories won't go away not never never like it was yesterday.. 
that time never felt so good, never forget about you never never would
Old memories won't go away not never never like it was yesterday.. 
that time never felt so good, never forget about you never never would
Old memories won't go away not never never like it was yesterday.. 
that time never felt so good, never forget about you never never would
Say you never never would (Say you never would)
Just can't forget about you, No No no no
You know I never would and I never could
and don't think that I can never ever could and don't think I can
I know you'd understand.. woo ooo
