[Chorus 2x]
I said give me a new pair, I need a glass pair
you know I'm swingin drop top in the sun
them boys hatin cuz they ain got none

[Verse 1]
I like them glass 84s we call 'em swangers
you try to jack me you puttin your life in danger
I never slip and the triggers close to my finger
Yo gal big digdin the ride but can you blame em

Now if you look and see 84 glass here gleamin
you couldn't get this shine white with ma pink glow geanie
You know I make ma trunk pop, got paint that flip flop
candy that drip drop, I keep ma elbows in top top

I got the limited edition Mr. Davids got me clean
custom leather, wooded out you should see how I drop the screens
5th wheel on the back with a fitted astros hat
candy paint changin colors just depend how the sun at

dont get me wrong man now paul wall he ain't dumb man
them 30s cool but they really ain't the ones man
you cannot sit there and tell me that you got some man
if you not ridin 3s or 4s yoo cannot stunt man

[chorus 2x]

I'm at the car wash shinin up ma glass four
you know I'm cappin so they callin me an asshole
I could tell they neva seen a slab like this before
they just standin there admirin ma trunk glow
I said excuse me miss I only wanna fuck you
she said I love you boo especially in ya candy blue
I said ma candy blue looks nice check ma ice
I'm diamond out bitch don't even match the price

I'm in the dirty, dirty, dirty you know how we do
most people ridin on dubs but some got 22s
but I like ma candy drop with reclinin top
elbows is pokin out with the trunk stay propped
these rims ain't all purpose I cant floss every day
sometimes I gotta switch 'em up when its cloudy and grey
sprewells they stop and go but sprewells gotta go
soon as the sun come out I'm shootin spiders all four

oh, watch me I treat ma slab like ma bride
with real wedding ring Gucci dress on the inside
see me chunkin up the duece out the electric roof
I put adaptors on them hos now I got a wireless shoe
oh I'm sittin so throwed they boppin while I'm drivin them
Kooyoo where you gettin them swangers are you buyin them?
15 is my size in them big tapes will quiet them
even if I'm flippin alone you know I'm ridin them

Nothin get me love at first sight like homie night
them 83s, 84s they all tight
only one problem them jackers be out at night
you hit the curb and it mess up your whole night
whats my basis I drop a bunch of big faces
Papa's outrageous he catchin all type of races
chrome grill on the front lookin like braces
I'm ridin swangers you heard me sorry no dating

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
