[Dave - Verse Two]
You gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip hop crime
With these dope raps and dope tracks you move heads
Went from B-Boys to bein dope boys instead
Musically the Quest, never compromised
With the new version let the dated one slide
Continuin a legacy, true to the shit
If you don't know us then you're new to the shit
So what you gonna do with the times that exist?
Can't fake moves on your man or your sis
But if your sis is a bird, your man is a clown
Then have an intervention sit they dumb asses down
Whatever it may be in today's society
"Everything is Fair" at least it's how it seems to me  
As long as you're candid, earn your respect
And if they play phony then they gotta get checked
Especially if you're rhymin, live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
We 'gon play it by the code of the streets
So listen to the gems, flooded over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
Make you get a your hook like a can of mean junkies
What you gotta do is know that fam is in the sphere
The Poet 86 is prominent like Shakespeare
("Edgar Allen Poe..." - Q-Tip)

[Chorus: Sample chorus of "Excursions" by A Tribe Called Quest] (Dave)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (Can't fake the moves y'all)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves  (De La, Tribe Called Quest, J. Period)
C'mon, we gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on!)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVES....


"Time is running out on black power Africans today
 and whites blacks reporters at night
 Everytime you see them ?? with their tongues hangin out
 Time is running and past and passing and running
 Running and past and passing and running (excursions)"
