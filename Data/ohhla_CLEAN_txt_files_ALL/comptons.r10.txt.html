[Intro]
Straight off the streets of Compton, dedicated and by most suckers hated
Would you put your hands together for.. Eazy-E and N.W.A.?  (*Echoes*)

(*Explosions*)

[MC Ren] When we're on the stage, we're in a mothafuckin' rage, so Dre
[Dr. Dre]  What up?
[MC Ren] Why don't you get the 12 guage? 
[Dr. Dre]  Aww, yeah

[MC Ren]
And show them how Eazy-Duz-It
So if you punks wanna lay somethin' of it
Step up, run up, get up, what's up sucker?
You want some of this?
Then you're a stupid mothafucker
Kickin, like the kick from a kickdrum
Yella boy on the drum gettin' dumb
Programmin, a beat that's hittin' "that's what?"
And if you listen then you'll know we're not bullshittin'
Dope, like a pound or a Key, yeah
So shut the fuck up and listen to me
I make the killin'
I got fatter shit to the ceilin, why's that?
Cause I'm the mothafuckin' Ruthless Villain
MC Ren, stompin' any fool in my way
With some help from my homeboy Dre

[Dr. Dre]
Well, check this out
Now my name is Dre, uha, the mothafuckin' doctor
Yo, rippin' shit up, awww yeah, and here to rock you
With some help from my homeboy E
The criminal of the Ruthless Posse
Cold funkin' it up "word up" is what we do
The reputation of the N.W.A. crew
Gettin' busy because we're cold stompin'
And we're born and raised
And we're born and raised
And we're born and raised in Compton
Now, all the ladies, all the ladies
All the ladies if you're good to go
Come on, say Aaooowww                  "Aaooowww"

[Break]
[Dr. Dre]  Ayyio Ren, won't tell them what the fuck you are, home boy
[MC Ren]  Ruthless Villain superstar
[Dr. Dre]  Yo, I don't think they heard you, won't tell them what you are

[MC Ren]
I'm a Ruthless gangster, definition Villain
Leave your shit unlocked and he's stealin'
So call the police cause that's all you could do "but what?"
He'll get away without leavin' a clue  "yeah"
Keepin' shit in control like the neighboorhood chief 
But, referred to as a walkin' thief
They say he's a bad influence for the kids, home boy

[Dr. Dre]   Why the fuck they're blamin' him?
[MC Ren]  Cause he's the one that they jock
[Dr. Dre]   Cause he's... (*Explosion*)</pre>
