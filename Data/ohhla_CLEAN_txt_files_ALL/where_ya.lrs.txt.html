Where ya been Lars?
Where ya been?
Where ya been Lars?
Where ya been?

I've been touring everywhere just to bring this world joy
On a three year long mission just to merch &amp; destroy
I've been to Sydney, been to Dublin, been to Tokyo and back
Still rocking Capcom hoodies and that dirty A's cap
I'm still repping Northern Cali, hella non-conformist
I toured with Gym Class Heroes and then they got ginormous
I've drawn a lot of comics and I've rocked a lot of shows
I saw Nerdcore come and I saw Nerdcore go
I did a track with mc chris, though I kind of wish I'd knew
He'd be like "I want three grand for that verse or I'll sue" (true)
I opened for T-Pain, he had zero production
He made my drummer move his drums, gave his stage manager instructions (move your drums)
I DJ-ed Johnny Phillips wedding, Gerard Way was there
I'm like "We have the same booking agent," he's like "ask me if I care?"
I met Weird Al, I met Flava Flav
I met DMC but the photo wouldn't save
I'm like "Camera phones suck," he's like "I know they're really tricky"

He didn't actually say that, but if he had, it would have been good for comedy purposes
CP's y'all!

CP's. Alright</pre>
