Staring at the walls of the booth my mind tends to drift
Like a crashed plane leaving survivors lost on an island
My pent up rage got me locked in a cage
Like a Rikers Island inmate barely surviving
My thought process is to keep on striving
I ran out of gas but I keep on driving
I feel negativity but keep on sliding
The positive is pushing me to keep on riding
The saxophones in the beat put me where I want to be
Like Jas Mace going hard rocking for the cheap seats
Or A-C-E in front of the MP
Going hard pushing keys trying to make that heat
But things change I realize it ain't the same
Where it's cheaper to buy a grill than cop the propane
Surrounded by hood rats, pimps, pushers, and trash
Where bags of green cost the same as gas
So I get high, instead of going to my gear
Talked the same but I spent it looking fly as a saint
But Geo said vanity will take away your sanity
To advocate the evil like Keanu Reeves regals
Drop ragtops with gold Daytons attached
Went to school but the rap was my goal so I snapped
In the age where we drop out to pump crack
Rock Tims, hold gats, tecs cock back
Motivated by the thugs from the south
Track track boys on the map, crunk beats in the back
Man, how you love that
How you love that

Hook

This my mind set if you feel that
Come and rock with the kid how you love that
We got the roof back skylines the ceiling
Oh you love that, fly's how I'm feeling

Everyday is like a new year, a new beginning
Gotta get up with the sunrise wipe the sleep from my eyes
Trying to make it through life with no surprises
But it's tough when you gotta juggle work kids and college
Not to mention your girl wants the time she deserves
So I really can't get mad at the girl
This world is a fucked up place but I make the best of it
And don't expect nothing less from it
Even though it makes me sick in my stomach because the rich gotta run it

Life's a bitch but we done it to ourselves
Turned heaven to hell and turned paradise into a cesspool some damn fools
Y'all know the rules to the game
It's like the Yin and the Yang ain't a damn thing changed
This pen be my remedy
Cause I'm still making dope lines like the coke heads of the 70's

Hook

This my mind set if you feel that
Come and rock with the kid how you love that
We got the roof back skylines the ceiling
Oh you love that, fly's how I'm feeling</pre>
