[Intro: DJ Evil E]
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm living!!

[Ice-T]
This is the story of my life

[DJ Evil E]
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm living!!

[Ice-T]
That's how I'm living!!
Check it, that's how I'm living!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
I was born in New Jersey (HUH!)
They said it before but I guess nobody heard me
My mother died young
No sisters or brothers, I was her only son
When I was twelve my pops died too
What's a brother was supposed to do?
They sent me out West, to live with my aunt
I guess they thought that was the best
But there was no love there
And growing with no moms, I guess I was prepared, to live in a vacuum
The bedroom, the kitchen, the hall, the bathroom
I didn't leave home much, I didn't like L.A.
I didn't have no friends to trust, got bust to a school
Blacks and whites, I guess it was cool
But by High School I changed
I didn't wanna bust, I didn't wanna play the game
I walked to Crenshaw high (THAT SHIT WAS FLY!!)
I hooked up with new crew
Some brothers just seemed like they knew what the fuck to do
You might call it a Gang, but we called it a Set
And it was our own thing, the whole school was down
And one way or another, everybody fucked around
Whether hardcore or not
You wore the right color or your ass got shot
That's how you're living!!

[Chorus: Trigger Tha Gambler]
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm Living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm Living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm Living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm Living!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I did three years in (UHH!) and made close friends
Having no love, my homies became my only
I was glad; the family I never had, I grew up fast
I got a girl in 10th grade pregnant, needing cash
Had to change my style
Switched from banging for hustling, no more going buckwild
Had to get a cash-flow
But my hustle was weak, it was a no Go!
I've joined the army
Four years in that shit be all the fuck you can be
Came back to the hood, my homies had done good
Had elevated their game
About a hundred Gs a lick, no shame
Passed for the jewels, baby sledgehammers were the tools
I speak on this with hesitation
Even though it passed the statue of limitation
That's how I'm living!!

[Chorus: Trigger Tha Gambler]
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's how I'm living!!

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I checked the bank
I bought a Porsche, some gear and earned high street rank
But as I grew, my whole crew fell through
Cops had us on the books, as interstate crooks
Murder, robbery, rape or escape, the whole damn nine
I robbed a nigga blind
I had too much juice, I cut my boosters loose
Was intrigued with the Pimp Game, I took on the Ice-name
But the Pimp Game moved too slow
Especially for a nigga who was hooked on quick dough
Then one night late, I was in a car-wreck and was lucky to escape
Hospital for ten weeks in a bed, almost dead
And when I got well
I got caught in a cross and got locked in a jail cell
That's how I'm living

[Chorus: Trigger Tha Gambler]
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's How I'm Living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's How I'm Living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's How I'm Living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's How I'm Living!!

[Ice-T]
Montreux if you feel me out there, Say YEAH!! (YEAH!!)
Say HELL YEAH!! (HELL YEAH!!) YEAH!!

[Chorus: Trigger Tha Gambler]
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's How I'm Living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's How I'm Living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's How I'm Living!!
That's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's.. that's How I'm Living!!

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
Check it, so I changed my life
I put down the gun, picked up the mic
It took ten years, to get from there to here
But I still keep a gun, cops got me on The Run
And they hate me more, now, than they ever did before
My homies came back from the pen (Penitentiary)
And we all worked together, true friends
But every once and while some chump, mistakes me as a punk
And he gets in my face, wrong motherfucking place
And I ain't lying, that's how you're dying

[Evil E]
Yo baby, yo man, this shit was fly man, Switzerland know how you're living,
man
But I don't think they wanna see me on the microphone doing this shit, man
Y'all, did y'all wanna see me rap or what?

[Trigger] Awww Shit!

[Evil E] If y'all wanna see me on the microphone..

[Ice-T] You do not wanna see Evil E rap, don't wanna do this!

[Evil E]
The Great, The Great, The Great..
If y'all wanna see me rhyme, make some noise
Say YEAH!! (YEAH!!) HELL YEAH!! (HELL YEAH!!)</pre>
