1st Verse: 
Well I'm new in the town. Holla if it's any new
super-villains around. 'Cause I'm killin' it now
I done popped a couple of uppers I think I'm feelin' somethin'
Pardon me while I levitate up on him and head butt him
Uppercut him and gut him. Lil' blood, ain't nuthin'
I hear the sirens comin' from a mile away, but fuck 'em
They don't wanna die today. They don't get paid enough
And I don't get paid shit so suck my...
Hold up, lost in the buzz. Forgot what the point was
But it don't matter now do it? It don't and I knew it
Now find a good place to hide, 'fore I lose it
If you really ready to fight crime, then let's do this!

Chorus:
I got a mask. I got a cape
Got a lawyer in case I catch a case
Got a shrink. She gimme pills
(Uh, you know you're not a hero right?) Chill
I'ma villain. Get it right
You want to reach me? Then shine a light
In the sky. Up and away
This is how I fight crime every day!

2nd Verse:
Im on the corner, Biscayne, 7-9
3 in the mornin', yawnin' but I get off at 5
And that's when I heard the trouble. Teleport on the double
Arrived at the scene of the incident, facing a couple
Double-D's in m face like BAM!
She said, (can you help me?) I said I can
Now what's the problem? (My pimp gon' kill me)
Really? I'ma get to the bottom of this. Y'all feel me?
Aye Pimpin! (What it is?) This your trap? (Yessir)
She hit the track and ain't  bring it back. What?
I roundhoused her. Gave the dough to Pone
Took my cut. Another problem solved and I'm gooooone.

Chorus:
I got a mask. I got a cape
Got a lawyer in case I catch a case
Got a shrink. She gimme pills
(Uh, you know you're not a hero right?) Chill
I'ma villain. Get it right
You want to reach me? Then shine a light
In the sky. Up and away
This is how I fight crime every day!

3rd Verse:
3rd verse. Its goin down/ 
Heard it's a new villain in town and they want my crown
They can have that shit. Along with this ass-whoopin'
Man you blind and trippin'. You don't know what you stepped in
I'm an omega-level, pyrokinetic telepath
Damn straight. Take your cape, wipe my ass and laugh
I accept your challenge. You better get an outfit
You want to be buried in. So consult your stylist
The time is, slowly approachin'. Before you know it Its go time
He came with henchmen the whole nine
Of course I took out the whole line in no time
Then a shadow rose and blocked out the sunshine
(That was just a test to see if you were worthy of punishment)
Is your super power your mouth? 'Cause you good at runnin' it
(Fuck you! You killed my brother!) Who's your brother?
The dude from the 1st verse! Oh that muthafucka'
Well sheeet, I'm about to get a 2 for 1
Nullify your powers and hit you with the super gun. Bang!
Then all of a sudden, it all went black
And all I heard was, (SKAM2? you ain't shit, I'll be back!)

Chorus:
I got a mask. I got a cape
Got a lawyer in case I catch a case
Got a shrink. She gimme pills
(Uh, you know you're not a hero right?) Chill
I'ma villain. Get it right
You want to reach me? Then shine a light
In the sky. Up and away
This is how I fight crime every day!</pre>
