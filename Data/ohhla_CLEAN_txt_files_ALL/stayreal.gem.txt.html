[Melissa Lujan]
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Oooh

[Big Gemini]
(Verse 1)
I could tell you that I love ya
Tell you that I need ya
I would just be lying, girl, if I wasn't
On stage, clockin' dollars, makin' audiences hollar
Would you still want me in your world
If I worked a 9-to-5 and had no money
Brokedown house and my car looked funny
Would you still come over, cook meals for a player
Or ride down the street and give a [{*fuck*}] who's there
Now
Oooh
You say that you love me, baby
The way I think drives you so crazy
I ain't gon' lie
You be on my mind, I try to keep out
But you so damn fine

Chorus:
[Melissa Lujan] When I tell you that I love you
                There's nobody else like you
                Would you love me back
                And show me that you
                Feel the same, too
[Big Gemini]    I wish I could tell you what you wanna hear
                But I can't lie, I gots to stay real
[Melissa Lujan] Cause you and I was meant to be
                Me for you and you for me

(Verse 2)
Think I was meant for you, ma
And you was meant for me
And all of this was destined, you know who I meant to be
That's why I keep my distance, never get too close
I love the way we kick it, there can never be more
I tried it in the past, but it never seemed to last
Girls came and they went, some never came back
Blame it on the game, I don't blame on myself
We can still be homies after all, if nothing else
Now
You say that you love me, baby
The way I think drives you so crazy
And I can't change the way I feel
But you gotta know that I'm for real

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
You my homie, lover, friend, no strings attached
You free, I'm free, let's just keep it like me
I'm hardly ever even home, [{*shit*}], I'm always on the go
Chasin' this paper, surrounded by [{*hoes*}]
You don't want a man that can give you no attention
You don't want a man that rap for a livin'
And you don't want the drama that it all come with
Or maybe you don't care, tryin' to hit you a lick
Oh
I, don't, know, what you want
From me, girl
Or should I say
"I do know
What you want from me"
But that's just somethin' that can never be (Oh!)

Repeat Chorus

[Melissa Lujan] Baby, baby, baby
                Baby, baby, baby
                Oooh
[Big Gemini]    I wish I could tell you what you wanna hear
                But I can't lie, I gots to stay real
                But I can't lie, I gots to stay real
[Melissa Lujan] Baby, baby, baby
                Baby, baby, baby
[Big Gemini]    But I can't lie, I gots to stay real
[Melissa Lujan] Baby, baby, baby
                Baby, baby, baby</pre>
