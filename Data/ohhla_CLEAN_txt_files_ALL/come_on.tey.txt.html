Song:   Come On
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Can't you see you got this hold on me?
Want you lift me up and never bring me down!
Won't ever lose control, take it nice and slow
I like the way it feels, could this be love (could this be love)?
Well lemme give you the receipe of destiny
It starts with me and you
And maybe I'll be the melody so sweet, it's never out due
Now I wanna be the one you need
Like yeah you pray attached to you
So baby, come on come on, come on!

[Chorus]
What you do to me?
Living in a fantasy
Is no one in the whole wide world,
Baby it's just you and me!
So baby don't you break my heart
And don't you wanna play your part
So baby baby come on, come on, come on!
Oh, baby give it to me (baby give it to me)
And then you like what you see (you know you like what you see)
Oh, baby give it to me (baby give it to me)
And then you like what you see (you know you like what you see)
Oh, baby give it to me (baby give it to me)
And then you like what you see (you know you like what you see)
And baby, baby, come on, come on!

Like sweet morning dew, I took one look at you
And It was plain to see, you are my destiny!

Shawty, I'm here for you anytime you need me
For real boy, it's me in your world, believe me nothing make a man feel better than a woman
A queen with a crown that be down for whatever.
Is a few things it's forever
Your lady, we can make war, make babies
Back when I was nothing
You made the Shawty feel like she was something
That's why I'm with you til this day boy no frontin'
Even when the skies look great, you will rub me on my back,
And say baby, it will be OK!
Now that's real to a woman like me, baby
Never ever give you love in a way I keep it tight, ight

[Chorus]
What you do to me?
Living in a fantasy
Is no one in the whole wide world,
Baby it's just you and me!
So baby don't you break my heart
And don't you wanna play your part
So baby baby come on, come on, come on!
Oh, baby give it to me (baby give it to me)
And then you like what you see (you know you like what you see)
Oh, baby give it to me (baby give it to me)
And then you like what you see (you know you like what you see)
Oh, baby give it to me (baby give it to me)
And then you like what you see (you know you like what you see)
And baby, baby, come on, come on!</pre>
