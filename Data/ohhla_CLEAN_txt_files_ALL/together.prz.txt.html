Y'all ready?

Together (together)
The motherfucking ants (the ants)
Can conquer (can conquer)
The motherfucking elephant (the elephant)

M-1:
This is for Mumia and Sundiata
Herman Bell, we got you
Mutulu Shakur, we want you free with Assata
And Giuliani yo, you can swim with the lobsters
I hope you mobsters lose your livers to the vodka 
Somebody needs to get took hostage
This is preposterous
Got a whole nation up in bondage
It might sound rash, but nigger we about to crash
We're in a race for life, you thinking it's for cash flow
I'm going to be the asshole coming in the party to harass you
Or should I say, "Fuck it!" and just dance too?
But we don't dance no more, unless it's capoeira
We the new rap era of natural born guerillas
Cause anything can happen if you make it so
I'm like George Jackson; .45 in my afro
I'm like Marcus Garvey coming with money to blow
Saying I want an army of boats full of niggers that led 
revolts
On that note, I'm sick of these scared millionaires
Better get your nuts back 'cause crackers thinking it's theirs
Drop a jewel not a bracelet
Face it, 90% of us still fighting for the basics

stic.man:
Yo I'm true to the struggle, not new to the struggle
Been through many trials, many forms of hustles
Spent nights in the county for bullshit charges
Fist fights with police cussing at the sergeants
Beef over females, you know how that goes
Niggers' egos turn best friends to foes
I've been robbed, beat up, scared to fight
Niggers busting shots off, had to run for my life
But I ain't no gangster wannabe thug
Never glorify selling dope 'cause I see my brother on drugs
And it's painful, this game's so dirty and foul
Even the hospital just might murder your child, if you ain't 
careful
But I'm a rebel to this whole era
African root, imported like capoeira
Ready for whatever that's where I want to be
Able to destroy any enemy in front of me or inside of me, see
That's a jewel, if I overlook the enemy within then I'm a fool
Can't judge a book by its cover
Can't trust every sister or brother
'Cause they could be undercover
DTs, BPs got jewels for days
From making mistakes I learned to correct my ways
And it pays to stay humble, study your lessons
Don't wanna see your own blood on your weapon

Chorus:
DP
Not to be confused with niggers who just do music
It's that true shit (ghetto prose)
Not to be confused with niggers who just do music

stic.man:
Yo, don't be yelling, "People's Army!" if you ain't training
Just want to rap like it's all about some entertainment
How we too busy to train but got time to smoke?
Ain't got no money for class but got an ounce of 'dro
We could be learning how to sew, get skills that's useful
Instead of this fake thug shit we used to
We could bling, but a chain is only as strong as its weakest 
link
That's why the whole People's Army got to keep in sync

M-1:
EME, UNO, you know, PA
Niggers is opposite of the po-po
We say, "Together, the ant can conquer the elephant"
They say, fuck what they say 'cause shit is irrelevant
Soldiers, where's your heart?
Show me the love, what you made of 
This is the shit that could make thugs turn revolutionary, 360
He with me, she with me
Anything for you, give up my kidney
Yo, it's in my blood like shots of Remy
What's gotten in me? I see the goddamn enemy
Give me the gat so I can smoke this cracker
This is Uhuru, nigger blak-a blak-a blak-a
I study Chairman Mao, Malcolm, and Mau Mau, who with it? 
It's self-defense, you want the blau? Come get it
BEO, BLE, soldiers living better lives
For self and for family, do or die

Chorus:
DP
Not to be confused with niggers who just do music
It's that true shit (ghetto prose)
Not to be confused with niggers who just do music


It's hard work

Together (together)
The motherfucking ants (the ants)
Can conquer (can conquer)
The motherfucking elephant (the elephant)

One more time

Together (together)
The motherfucking ants (the ants)
Can conquer (can conquer)
The motherfucking elephant (the elephant)

You heard me? (we heard you)</pre>
