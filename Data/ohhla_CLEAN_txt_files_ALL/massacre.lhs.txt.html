[Intro]
Snowgoons! (Yeah)
(Yeah, 'Mala, yo)

[Chief Kamachi]
I got them, missionness nuns that visit the slums
40's of holy water, weed smoke in they lungs
Black long robe's hidin all the clips to my guns
Left the bishop dead, gave my children the ones
Hallelujah, about to put some hollows through ya
Twin altar boys, nicknamed righteous Rugers
Alley cats in the jungle trying to fight with cougars
Kamala, Lord Lhus straight for the door rush
Quan got the bombs in the back of the tour bus
Soldiers all highed up, sniffin the war dust
Zapped out, think you had Kimbo tapped out
Mercenary style, got the industry mapped out
Black heathens with the Mac, blow your whole fuckin back out
I'm serious, y'all think I'm straight on that rat route
Y'all atheist, y'all don't believe in the God
So I punish you, you better start believin in God
'Mala! (Savage Brothers, geah!)

[Verse Two]
Bones snap, Indiana Jones rap, hold back nothin
Tongues attack with no substance
What's goin on? I move strong like I'm Atlas, cause madness
See more tragic than traffic in this automatic
I gotta squeeze at least three in the breeze if you
be into P's, you speak Vietnamese
Cause you tongue-twisted, fuck business, I'ma dump missiles
Slugs hit you, ain't a thug is you?
I'm official like, white and black stripes on my back
I'm like, +Mike+ when I +Jack-son+ like Ike when I'm slappin
I kick a smooth flow so your wife want me smashin
Trife with the ratchet like I smite from the Nazareth
Slightly above average ain't quite what I'm after
Like, titans when they clashin like Christ without the passion
Big bang theory light slices through the atom
And blow the fuckin set up like lights, camera, action

[Lord Lhus]
Yeah~! Delete the carbon copy, wrath of a beast
Nothing you spit can stop me, head too cocky
Showing your teeth, reach out with Chief Kamachi
Breathe inside the gas chamber, I love to torture you
I treat you like the last stranger, proceed to slaughter you
Just like a martyr you coward, this is a call for blood
You can't get down or lay down, we ain't comin for love
Ignite the bombs with fuse gettin lit, lookin suspicious
Believe me God I'm blowin up shit, you be my witness
I'm the most satanic, worship myself
Because I know I'm Satan, I know you hatin
Cursed with the hell of seein, the noise I'm makin
What you sayin? Nothin, see homey now that's the problem
I got too much on my mind and not rap, so then I'm starvin
I'm takin steak off your plate, that's how it has to be
You've had plenty of time to eat homey it's time to for mines to feed
Word up, Lord Lhus bringin down the place
Bringin out the hate, I take rhymes and bang 'em in your face

[Verse Four]
Welcome to Hell... where the goblins dwell
One life, one show, cross me oh well
And I never forget it, I police myself
40 bottles, good green, go for delf
Take a look at my eyes and ruin yourself
It's nothin but pain left, and I'm bad for your health
Somebody call the doctor this man needs help
+Iron Fist+ swing shatter the asteroid belt
I'm a problem, like an Earthbound comet
Raised in the projects, a wild environment
No tigers and bears, just llamas and towers
Six hours have you benchin them flowers
Refine my power, feast and devour
Are we cowards? Nah, I fear none
Send the shot to your ear drum, you hear me son?
Never stop 'til the beat's done, equal to none
Ha ha!</pre>
