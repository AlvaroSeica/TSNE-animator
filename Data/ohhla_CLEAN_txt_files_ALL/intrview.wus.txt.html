[Intro: female reporter]
Today we are sitting here with recording artist Mylansky and Joe Mafia
Formally know to the World as the group Wu Syndicate
Now it's been some time now since you guys released another album
So tell me what happened
Cause there has been some rumors that you had matters with the label
That resulted in both of you leaving the rap game
I mean, A lot of fans that bought the first record
Had been sending millions of letters to our show
Asking us to have you guys come on here
And bring some type of closure to all the speculations
In your own words Joe Mafia, Just try to take us back to how it all started

[Joe Mafia]
It started in ninety-eight when The Swarm hit
The World got a glimpse of the best kept secret in V.A
We out in L.A., Lamping with Wu-Tang
When our demo hit the table
Lot of in house niggas had got scraped
For a deal over half a mil, Hit the studio
Poe got bagged before we finished half the album
Mya had to bang it out, Feature a few niggas
Registered with ass, Counting cash that they threw niggas
Got some cameos and videos, In the process got a gold plaque
Niggas going Hollywood without a contract
And the album was finished
Tried to sign us on some bullshit with no lawyers
Had me on some fuck rap shit we bucked til they broke us off
Did a couple of shows and promo tours
Damn near had to go to war with our own team
Cause niggas fucked up cream and kept switching managers
New video on the box and good press
Magazines and clothing endorsements, We set right
Sound scan for a couple a hundred grand
But still on the block fam, Give me my Goddamn check
Turned our back on the industry and mapped it out
Revamped and failed, Same plan, And now we doing us
We was this close to getting chirped, We work
Said fuck the fame it's all about the paper work, work

[Interlude: female reporter]
Wow, That's very interesting, So Myalansky
In your own words I need you to bring some type of closure
To all of these rumors and questions that a lot of fans have been asking
You know the stories about you getting incarcerated
Along with feature member Napolean
Who served a five year sentence and also beefed with the management
So in your own words Mylansky, Please explain to the fans what happened

[Myalansky]
I left the rap game because of business issues
Niggas asking me questions
You still with Wu-Tang, Laugh and I tell em
Nah duke I had to switch labels, Needed more then the fame
Lawyers still calling for my royalty claim
Brought a gold plaque back to the hood, First cat in Virginia
Before Pusha-T and Malice remember
The Swarm appeared on top of Billboard charts
Half a million applauded
Where Was Heaven had em feeling the story
Napoleon incarcerated, Mafia my partner is dangerous
Sling them contracts off to get straightened
Gave ten grand to Charlie Hine he hooked me up with ??? an time
Ordered advance money before we was signed
Conflict with the management put itineraries on hold
Had team summon bitch because we didn't show
Can't miss what I never had, Die before I'm kissing they ass
I hit the block still getting my cash
