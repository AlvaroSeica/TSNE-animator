[Speak]
Just woke up another day another dollar that I ain't make
Another search for that one soul I can't hate
Can't think of a wrong turn I ain't take
or think of a past bitch I ain't rape
or at least think about it
Because if you talk about it got to be about it
At least that's what they used to tell me when I dreamed about it
Self-suppression and hate where would I be without it
Seems to be the only reason I can script
This shit, but fuck it I live this shit
So why not speak about hell, seems I know it so well
They say you make the happy endings to the stories you tell
And that's bullshit, so if I get a range then maybe I'll get a bitch
Put hickeys over her neck instead of slittin her shit
Join a local church stock bibles at the crib
Have a daughter and support her at ballet recital gigs
Barbecues with neighbors and a belly full of beer
Nine to five every mornin mad cause I never lived
Nigga fuck that, cause I would rather be
the nigga with the whole world mad at me than the faggot I'm not

[Chorus]
Why the fuck you talkin to me like I ain't got guap (you don't)
Why you actin like my tape won't knock (it won't)
Well fuck you and I hope you rot (croak)
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Why the fuck you talkin to me like I ain't got guap (you don't)
Why you actin like my tape won't knock (it won't)
Well fuck you and I hope you rot (well, you're an asshole)
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Here's another rap from your favorite hipster faggot
The unfunny cunt youn rap Bob Saget
Who keeps a full house full of bitches like the Olsen Twins
And lets them heroin binge until they're flyin of the hinge
I'm a sleaze bag baby that's a known fact
Got a fetish for them black girls that make their ass clap
But they don't fuck with me my dick is extra medium
So I sit home alone higher than some helium
No one was feelin him until I threw a curve ball
A couple sticks of dynamite stuffed inside a Nerf ball
How you makin hits swingin with a wifflebat
How the fuck you gettin high puffin simple nickel sacks
Nickelback, fickle rap, I'm bringin Tommy Pickles back
Bitch fuck your kids tuck them in I think they need a little nap
I'm in your kitchen now puffin on a cigarette
You can toss my salad but don't forget the vinaigrette
I'm balsamic with Islamic fundamentalist
A real motherfucker catchin wrecks like Oedipus
Better warn you relatives when I'm on the rampage
In a drunken half daze and I ain't touch a damn stage
But once I'm there I might come up live
And if her legs are opened up I might cum inside
Pussy fat like a welcome mat yellin Speaky welcome back
Leave it worn and leave it torn until I've had enough of that

[Chorus]</pre>
