Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Cno Evil]
Yeah, come on...

[Chorus: Cno Evil]
Still Rodentz, feel real moments
You still condone it? You still don't want it
You will not kill, we still fulfill
Until we drill in your skull with the skills
We back, with the real phat stuff
Like chicks in Brazil with the big fat butts
We still conceal, the art, we don't reveal
I'm real, the real life, deal or no deal

[Cno Evil]
Aiyo, to this day I still do alot of things
I hold the pen still, and I write alot of things
I clutch the mic still, and I rock on many tracks
I still sit back for a minute and relax
But still, life moves fast as I stand still
Alot of fake dudes that rap, but we stay real
Alot of bad habits, I still do, but not all
I still stand tall, I will not fall
I still rock the slaps, and the playboy wallos
Instill the memories, so they won't stay hollow
Walk through the footsteps, I still rep White Plains
Still live in the same driveway, Bronx River Parkway
Rock the same haircut, goatee, mustache required
The sides don't connect no more, that shit got very tired
Got rid of the dog chain, now I rock the silver gold
That was yesterdays news, and I'm getting kind of old
Still speak the Sicilian slang, let the wife beater hang
Rock the Mets hat, next years the year, man
Still keep my phone on vibrate, I never liked ringtones
Changed up the service cuz those bills done took they toll
I still bong bong, I still make long songs
When I buy Sesame chicken, I still get wontons
Yes, you guessed it, me and that chick, we still don't get along
Still the chance of reconcilation ain't long gone
And yes, I still ain't got an automobile
Still got the same job, so I'm saving up for wheels
But still, I use that same money to buy meals
And I kind of walking, son, I'mma be real
That's how I'm still in that same shape, don't gain weight
Metabolism keeps me like that, and I feel great
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up for a second
I'm still Cno Evil and I'm still a lethal weapon

[Li-Mouse]
Yeah, I'm still Mouse and I'm up on these tracks
I'm still going all out, cracking them backs
Still fucking with my man, Sincere Noble
Still melt ya'll down like this was Chernobyl
I still push that H deuce under the hood
Still mix the Goose, juice, taste real good
I'm still watching out for them Asian chicks
And you know that Mouse, still be raising my fist
But yo, these niggas be, hating on this
Like I still don't got a vicious moving wrist
Still move the pen, so I be, killing the paper
Slam down on ya, like I was a stapler
Me and Cno, still fulfill your ears with pleasure
Volumes of liquid a chemist, still can't measure
And I still hear shit that sounds like an atrocity
Move for centuries, and we still have the velocity
That moves through iron, your mind remains still
As the spears still move through your skull for the kill
Trust me, no cure can stop, Li-Mouse's ill
Skills fill your mind like trash in land fills
The way I exhibit such a crafty feature
Blows up subwoofers and tweeters, bombing your speakers
Faggots will get laced up, like some new sneakers
Ya'll keep running with nothing on me like them faggot ass streakers
Huh, yeah I know most of ya'll don't care
But ya'll can get blown out, so here's the spare
Cno Evil, Li-Mouse, how many times can we say it?
Like fucked up football calls, yeah, you gotta replay it
Or shit in Chinese food, lysol, you must spray it
Listening to Noble beats, Rodentz, we must play it, muthafucka

[Outro: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Still Rodentz, feel real moments
Still condone it? You still don't want it
You will not kill, we still ful --- *beat stops, keys get hit*
Oh shit, oh what the fuck just happen... (did you just break it?)
I don't know (whaddu do??) I have no idea (what the fuck?) Hold that...
(What did you just do?) I don't know... the shit just like...
(No really.. what the fuck just happened?)</pre>
