  and Frankee - "F.U.R.B." and how the two songs were produced.   

Uuhh oh oh
You joining?
Uh huh huh

See I am bored of the both you
Everybody's had enough
No one cares, we don't give a stuff
We have heard all this sh__ before
And we really don't care no we really don't care
It's getting really boring hearing you two squeal

____ your songs they don't mean ____ now
We don't give a ____ if you are having a row
It is all so fake and we don't believe
So just ____ off we want you to leave
____ your songs they don't mean ____ now
We don't give a ____ if you are having a row
It's all so fake and we don't believe
So just ____ off we want you to leave

You thought you could pull the wool over me
The whole thing was clearly
Set up, by your record company
You thought we'd believe your ___it
And we must be very dumb because we made you number one
The record buying public made it a hit

____ your songs they don't mean ____ now
We don't give a ____ if you are having a row
It is all so fake and we don't believe
So just ____ off we want you to leave
____ your songs they don't mean ____ now
We don't give a ____ if you are having a row
It's all so fake and we don't believe
So just ____ off we want you to leave

You have had your time now
You can bet everyone, thinks you are a t__t
And she is a sad cow
Now it is over and we are glad
Because you have had your one hit
And we have had enough of it
We are bored of your records and we think they are ____

____ your songs they don't mean ____ now
We don't give a ____ if you are having a row
It is all so fake and we don't believe
So just ____ off we want you to leave
____ your songs they don't mean ____ now
We don't give a ____ if you are having a row
It's all so fake and we don't believe
So just ____ off we want you to leave

(spoken normally)
You made me do this.  Slap the pair of you that is
I think I speak for the nation
Enough now (yeah)
In case the art' you did from America, or wherever you live, err
Obviously it was just a bit of a joke
But we actually really mean it
GO AWAY!</pre>
