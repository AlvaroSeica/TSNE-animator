[U-God]
Yo, rated x, smack you off the stage when I'm vexed
No sweat, I crack a cold case of Beck's
Guess whose back, the jack of all trades is next
The rap cuisine, I crack a raw egg and flex
I cave in your chest, this one came from the 'jects
Yeah, the cause and effect, make innocent blood pour
The streets is like the rap game, a daily tug of war
For rich or for poor, or death do us part, niggaz come for test

[Chorus 2X: U-God]
Still grimey (grimey, grimey)
Still slimey (slimey, slimey)
Don't try me (try me, try me)
It's been ten long years, you can't untie me

[U-God]
This is real talk, for, glamour and bucks
Yeah, I'm going out, baby, going out, standing up
On both feet, nigga approach me, get blown out the streets
Touch with both heat, you looking like roast beef</pre>
