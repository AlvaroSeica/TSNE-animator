People underestimate the Real Live
Life I fail, jake is on my tail

[ VERSE 1 ]
Watch yo' faggot ass clique get dropped
Niggas wanna take what I got, they cultivatin a plot
I got to let niggas know where I'm comin from, Duke
I ain't a fluke, I go that extra mile for the loot
My ill disposition, my demeanour gets meaner
When it rains cocaine, it gets greener
Hook it up, cook it up, a half a ki, I ain't a rookie
Let's turn that white bitch to a motherfucking cookie
We wanna be around for the breakdown, watch the shakedown
Undercover clowns violate the town
They wanna see our money grow
And we can all make it happen if we keep a steady flow
But niggas gots to be niggas, you know
When money piles up, sheisty niggas get robbed up
I fronted sonny some work
A couple of weeks went by, then I noticed I was cold jerked
We used to do that shit too
But don't ever in your life fuck your own fucking crew
Cos that's some low down shit
And when I catch up with you, pussy, yo' ass is hit

[ CHORUS ]
When the players get the cream, it spreads like a disease
I started with an ounce, now I'm workin with ki's
Niggas love to snitch, the jakes say, "Freeze!"
With friends like these, I don't need enemies
When the players get the cream, it spreads like a disease
I started with an ounce, now I'm workin with ki's
Niggas love to snitch, the jakes say, "Freeze!"
With friends like these, we don't need enemies

[ VERSE 2 ]
I bounced out of town quick just to make a fast lick
Sit back, recline on some Big Willie shit
The phone rings, it's my peoples on the other line
(Damn, you're the hardest nigga to find)
What's up, son? What's goin on? (Ain't nothing)
The last time we conversed (Word up), you had them burners goin off
But now I hear you graduated
And you're a big nigga now, a big cat, well-appreciated
Well I got the work, you got the street
Let's collaborate and make ends meet
We can conquer the whole city
And do the same damn thing like Capone and Nitty
When we finally struck a deal
This nigga started talkin crazy, now, this shit don't seem real
He started talkin about how we ( ? ) his head stiff
I'm sittin there, fucked up, with a lip split
Now I'm lookin at the niggas he's with
Undercover thugs with wire taps and bugs
Now I'm goin up off for life
Another thoughtless motherfucker was livin trife

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I had this short, thick red bone chick
Sippin Crystal every day, her style was slick
A dime piece, word is bond, just like one of the clique
A motherfucking Mona Lisa but black, not your common trick
She did just what I said
From flippin ki's to pickin up G's to givin me head
I used to kick back, relax like The Mack
Now bet shorty's puttin G's in a game of blackjack
I feel as though I'm the man
Cos I'm about to get some pussy, plus I won 45 grand
Now we out to the motel suite, copped a oz.
Now she 'bout to fuck a nigga to sleep
We puffin lye, so I make sure the door is locked
Then out from the closet, shit, niggas with they guns cocked
The first thing I thought - "Nigga, where's your gat?"
Cos all they gonna do is kill me anyway, black
I ducked like a pro, stayef low, bullets grazed my 'fro
Before you know I was bustin holes to the dome
I never thought she'd make me use my trigger
You wanna know the rest, yo, check the sequel, nigga

[ CHORUS ]</pre>
