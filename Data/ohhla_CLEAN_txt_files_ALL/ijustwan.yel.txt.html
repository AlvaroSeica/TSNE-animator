[Intro: Yelawolf] + (Gucci)
(Yeahhhhhhhhh, burr!)
Go white girl, it's your birthday
Go white girl, it's your birthday
Yelawolf mayne, and Gucci (Gucci!)
Go white girl, it's your birthday - yeah I know
Yelawolf and, Gucci, holler at'cha mayne
Yeah I know - so I got this 12-pack (burr!)
Yeah I know (we blowin smoke in the air)
We drinkin ice cold beer with your girl in my ear sayin (she just wanna party)

[Yelawolf]
"Trunk Muzik" got these boppers poppin on the Richter scale
D-boys on the corner droppin quarters like a wishin well
Ziplock in the freezer like your momma's box of Zinfandel
Sip it with your Southern belle, bet'cha she won't kiss and tell
Dipped in black I'm Mr. Pale, pack the pack and drink the ale
Gettin drunk, I'm drunk as hell, don't think I can leave my chair
Got a toothbrush for these dirty mouth 
motherfuckin rappers, you don't wanna see me there
Blindside 'em, rhyme side 'em, bitch I'll leave you readin Braille
You can't Lady Gaga me, the robber with the +Poker Face+
I come from the bottom, you ain't gotta put your dope away
Got so many hookups I can pull a motherfuckin train
Kitchen full of bottles, baby tell me what you want again

[Chorus: Tata] + (Gucci) + {Yelawolf}
I just wanna party - I just want, I just want
I just wanna party - I just want {Yeah I know}
(We blowin smoke in the air - burr! Burr! Burr!)
{We drinkin ice cold beer with your girl in my ear sayin}
I just wanna party {Yeah I know} (Yeahhhhhhhhh)
I just wanna party - I just want, I just want
I just wanna party - I just want {Yeah I know}
(We blowin smoke in the air)
{We drinkin ice cold beer with your girl in my ear sayin}
I just wanna party

[Gucci Mane]
(She just wanna party)
Gon' get +Wasted+, too wasted, so wasted it's scary
Yellow canaries in my ear, they pretty
Let's party like it's 1960, on the EA Jimmy Hendrix
Not a hippy, I'm a hippopotamus, I'm rollin up that rhinoceros
She jockin it and it's obvious, I land in yo' metropolis
Don't know who the baby father is, but I don't owe no apologies
She just want a Harley, I'm rollin up the Marley
I'm drunk as Paul McCartney, I'm 80 bottles shawty
The name's Gucci Mane, not Pootie Tang, I put it down, don't pick it up
Advice to you, don't pick on us, me and Yelawolf got crazy guns
We came in with five of 'em, I leave out with nine of 'em
That's fourteen I'ma keep around all mornin 'til I get tired of 'em
It's Gucci!

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
Cocaine on the table, Rittz the Rapper got 'em choppin lines
$20 bills are rolled up, Wiz Khalifa's rollin pine
Jackie Chain is rollin rollin, Yelawolf is pourin pourin
"Slow Motion" got hoes in motion, I think it's the perfect time
To put 'em in the mood, to put 'em in the car, take 'em to the house and - WHAT?
Take her to the room, take it to the mouth, how we do it Down South - WHAT?
I'm always going going, Ghet-O-Vision is sowing
Plowing, growing growing, cropdusting from a Boeing
Catfish Billy, on your grill-y, cook it up, make a milli'
Gettin stupid, gettin silly, drinkin beer-y, oh so chilly
Fucked up, but I'll tell you that I can't complain
Yelawolf and Gucci Mane, keepin yo' bitch entertained, yeah

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Huh~! (Bama!)
We just wanna party
Hah, hah, hah, hah
Yellow! Gucci! Burr!
That's hot</pre>
