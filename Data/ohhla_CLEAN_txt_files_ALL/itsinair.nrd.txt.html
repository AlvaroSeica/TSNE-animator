{*43 second speech to Congrees to open*}

[Pharrell]
{?} I'm sure you can tell
It's in the air, of our nation
It may shock ya, the mass hallucination
But the dead people, oh they dress well (yeah)
They say

[quick rap]
What's yo' name? You the one starin
Oh my God, lemme shake yo' hand
Do it like this, do it like that
Can you switch it up? Send it right back
Frown to your back, smile to your face
Think I keep it real, but I keep it fake
Think I'm ahead, but I'm the ass
Man I'm really sick, I really need a mask
Woof!

[Chorus]
And now it's in the air, spreading everywhere
So you should be prepared
(Ain't no pill or cough syrup)
(That can help so you better hurr'up)
C'mon {*3X*} hey {*3X*}
It's, in the air, hey {*3X*}
C'mon {*3X*} hey {*3X*}
It's, in the air, hey {*3X*}

[Pharrell]
To spread this thang, they don't need to talk
Instead they use, the precious lungs
But the scariest thing, they don't {?} kill ya
But they'll still LET PEOPLE, dancin like Thriller

[quick rap] + [Chorus]

[Pharrell]
They comin in, they get me now
What a shitstorm, of a situation
But a ray of light, comes to the biggest cloud
Stop big brother, and his invasion (yeah) c'mon

[quick rap] + [Chorus]</pre>
