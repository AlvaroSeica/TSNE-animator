There's equal spaces between the hurdles and steeple chases
So I don't go around blowing smoke in people's faces
Rather than acting like a pest to your spouse
I'll conduct my behavior like I'm a guest in your house
No matter what 'cause I found out you'll learn
It's your ass in the future if you fart on someone's furniture
Not everyone thinks having no class is funny
A fool is an outcast when he outlasts his money
I dress like an old man but so what and lord knows
I love little babies and I cry at award shows
It's nice to hear sad songs played on the piano
I'm a fan of the fine arts and John Gailliano
I use mere ? attempts to, to dispel on the powers
Of evil and believing, smelling the flowers even
Life is a flagrant, a thug will get stagnant
So follow your nose and savior the fragrance
I don't act hard and waste time with irrelevance
Or underestimate the audience's intelligence
I do what I do with skill and sincerity
I am what I am, not a fraud or a parody
So I don't act hard and waste time with irrelevance
Or underestimate the audience's intelligence
I just do what I do with skill and sincerity</pre>
