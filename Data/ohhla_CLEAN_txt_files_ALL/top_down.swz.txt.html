Swizzy!

where ever you are (Shine) whoever you are (Shine)
Hey, Hey, I told ya

[Chorus]
Ridin with my top down, and my jewelry on
Hey, I'm just getting my hood on
I'm just, I'm just, doing my thing
I'm just, I'm just, (pimp) doing my thing
Hey (yup) hey (yup) hey (yup) hey, I said I'm
Ridin with my top down, and my jewelry on
Hey, I'm just getting my hood on

[Verse 1]
I'm in the hood bouncin, Spray it like a fountain
Money like a mountain, Tell me why you're poutin
I know why you're poutin, Because we gettin paper
Hey, tell em again Swizzy, We getting that paper
I'm in the hood, top down, with my jewelry on me
With security on me, I got my goons on me
I get em off me, I shake them haters off me
DJ, Get em off me, I shake them haters off me
Niggaz is you with me, my bitches is you with me
If you got a problem, then suckah come and get me
Y'all know my name
You see the candy paint, it spell my name, Swizzy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It's like bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, you know the block is bumpin
Fiends on the corner man, you know the block is bumpin
Speakers in ya trunk, shit thumpin
They playin my song, people is jumpin
Now, we got a little block party y'all
And there ain't nuttin but, Henny and Bacardi y'all
Sittin on a stoop, on a milk crate
How you livin life?, Fucker say Great!
How many y'all come from nothin into somethin
Why these niggaz hatin? Why these niggaz frontin?
We just ridin with our tops down
Niggaz actin like somebody got shot now

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This chick said Swizz I wanna ride in ya Viper
I said Hell Nah don't you know that's a spiker
Number 2 outta only 20 in the world
You sit in my seat, it'll change ya world
I'm fresh to def, like a million bucks
Threw on my Louie hat, with my fuckin Gucc' chucks
Stepped out the Benz that bitch said Oh No
I said Easy Chick, you know I gotta go

[Chorus]

where ever you are (Shine) whoever you are (Shine)
where ever you are (Shine) whoever you are (Shine)
where ever you are (Shine) whoever you are (Shine)</pre>
