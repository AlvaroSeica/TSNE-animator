[John Bowie]
Hey Chris, it's Bowie
Uh, I'm at the PATH station
I was wondering if I could crash on your couch, would that be cool?
They locked me out of my apartment
Um, so call me back
There's a, there's a payphone here
Some kid stole my cell phone but the joke's on him cause
cause Sprint shut it off
Uh, just come by the station, alright?
I'm gonna be sleeping on one of the benches</pre>
