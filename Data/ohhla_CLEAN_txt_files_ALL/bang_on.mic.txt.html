[Iron Mic]
Aiyo, listen when I speak, people, I know what I'm saying
Go 'head, front if you want, to the morgue you be headed
I was born rugged, hands on the floor when I'm praying
Police kicked in my door, gone when they came in
You'll never get me alive, when you see 'em we banging
And I ain't going, and I see how they easily hang 'em
Niggas get hit at the border, man, they easily bang 'em
Chill with 3 more years, prepare for more staying
But still I hold heat, scream fuck the police
Until we all get a piece, it won't be no peace
Won't get this baking soda and coke on the streets
Ain't no way in the world my niggas won't eat
So fuck the government, and fuck the system
You better wake up, nigga, it's us against them
You better stack up ya ones, nigga, stack up ya guns
I mean that, I ain't rapping for fun
I'm trynna show these niggas where we from
Drag ya ass out the mansion, bring you back to the slum
So I can show you how we get it done
And show you, why the young is clapping for crumbs
I show you why your son packing the gun, cuz it's family struggle
And mom smoking, his father's a bum
What's in the beef, we throw our package and run
Now do that shit sound fun? Fuck it, I'm done
More dessies, more mack, more techs
Three years left til ya board, more stress
No money in ya stash, gone, what's left
Iron Mic, 12 Rounds, nigga, what's next?</pre>
