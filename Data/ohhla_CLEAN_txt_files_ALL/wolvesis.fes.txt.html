Song:   The Wolves Is Here
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 3X: Fes Taylor]
The wolves is here
The wolves is here
The wolves is here
The wolves is here

[Fes Taylor]
Aiyo, I spit it through the mic wire, I burn pen and pads
They ask when I write fire, even dikes admire
My girl left me in the prime of my life
Now I'm single having the time of my life, minus the strife
Platinum jewelry combining with ice
That don't fool me, match it to me, each blinding ya sight
My timing is right, hip hop searching for a new king
Not cuz I rock a few blings, my lyrics do sting
Front and I'm popping you, then, go get your crew and things
You wont do a thing, in court with the suit to sing
I ain't a wrestler, roll around in the ring
So I roll around with the pound, after three rounds, ding ding
Lights out, fuck a ten count, son, I've been about
Knock a nigga out, with a punch or a Guiness Stoute
Eat a nigga like lunch, wolves got a bigger mouth
Bitches got 'em hooked like, bass or some river trout, yeah

[Chorus 2X]

[Fes Taylor]
I'm from gang bang central, and my gun go off
So much, you can tell 'me Bang Bang sent you
All rappers stand back, cuz my slang may hit you
And I ran with the Pack, so the wolf fangs bit you
Even if the flames missed you, so what, the bullet still go
Right through his brain tissue, leave him tore up
So duck when I aim pistols out for you gut
My game official, son, I got bitches that plot on your bucks
And I got issues trying to get you shot at your slut
You a bitch too, reactions to the cops in the rush
Who the fuck got it popping like us, niggas is hoes
So guns blow in your face like my cock when it bust
You dick riders my click liver, my wolves got rabbies
We all in your face, spitting saliva
Screwdriving your biz, go get your homeboys, die with ya friends
See who survive to the end, muthafucka

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
