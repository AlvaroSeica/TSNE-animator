[Killah Priest]
Early natives related to thrones of David
Captured by some patriots, and thrown on slave ships
They stripped us naked, while the wives picked their favourite
Lives were wasted, in the hands of the hated
Driven from the garden of God
Now we starvin' in the martyring Sodom, they call it Harlem
Worldly problems got us at the bottom
The Earth crisis, had the righteous grabbin' ice picks
Seekin' pyschics for advices, I stay in ciphers
Our live is, connected to second son of Isaacs, which had a tight grip
On the heels of his brother, revealed to his mother
The elders should serve the younger, words heard in thunder
Held from under, rose and plague to grow with hunger
Now it's cold in summers, to slow your slumbers
Behold a number, 600, 6 and 3 score
The same as he saw, who ate his heat raw
In the time before they climbed aboard a dinosaur
Information held behind the doors
We came from the atmosphere, the physical trapped us here
Then they gave us crack and beer
In the back of the stairs please adapt your ears
Add or subtract the years, and from the unwise
And watch the sunrise from sunset, none-slept, one flesh, one breath..

[Chorus: Hell Razah, (Tekitha)]
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with god...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with god...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with god...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with god...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with god...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with god...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with god...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with god...)

[Killah Priest]
Devils marvel, they caught us playing with the gold marbles
We wrote novels, now we live life in the bottle
Before the devil sold me to the unholy
He caught my father, he told me
I live life amongst the lonely, lowly, lowly, lowly 
The president just ordered the navy to hit the borders of Haiti
Slaughtered babies from the waters of Euphrates
Maybe they send germs that polluted our sperm
And made us live uncircumcised in the serpent's eyes
And told us certain lies, and each day a servant dies
but in the halls of Pharaoh the walls are narrow
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom
Now free them, lets feed 'em, feed 'em....
They took the first book of Jacob to Jamaica
Promised us 40 acres and a mule
Treated like an animal, understand the jewel
Brought to the 50 states, Deuteronomy 28, verse 68
It all relates, 1555 is when we first arrived
We tell jokes wish 'em get high, and watch the fish fry...

[Chorus]

[Outro: Tekitha]
One Step...
One, One, Step, Step
One, One, Flesh
One, One, Step..
One, One, Breath...
One.. Step....
One... Step...</pre>
