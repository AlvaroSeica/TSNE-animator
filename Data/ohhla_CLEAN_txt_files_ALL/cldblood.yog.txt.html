[Intro/Chorus One: Canei Finch]
Started from the ground, built it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon' survive now?
Yeah, it's cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Yo Gotti]
In a nigga.. yeah; no love in a nigga..

If I can paint a picture, I'd show you a image 
of a dog ass nigga, yea, a raw ass nigga
Poppin' pain killers, riding for the cause
Four dogs wit dem pistols, n-n-natural born killers
He sold crack to his mother, turned his back on his brothers
Killed his partner for the plug, he think everything a hustle
C-cold mu'fucka, holmes numb
Black heart, no feelings, just a gun
He was raised in the trenches, not to mention all the hoes had dissed him
So holmes think the whole world against him
Played ball, coach benched him; grandpa, Klan lynched him
He was raised in Mississippi but he moved up to Memphis
Kinda hard to adapt...
So holmes turned to a strap...
Didn't succeed, tried rap, couldn't fight, got slapped
Shot dice, do crap, did time, back out, DAMN!

[Chorus Two: Canei Finch]
And from the ground, we built it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon' survive now?
Sch, it's cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

[Chorus One]

[J. Cole]
Hey.. no love, no love
How you gon' survive now?
No love, no love
Yo Gotti, lemme paint a picture for these niggas
Hey, huh..

Here's a, voice for the voiceless; my words like multiple choice 
to the choiceless; emerge like a search light 
in the darkness; for this young, black carcass
My niggas either join the Armed Forces, or they corpses now
In God we trust But it's bucks that we worship now
Boy that root of evil gon' forever rule the people
See, I seen just what that fast money gon' come and do to people
Hit a lick, it was a hit, he said Let's go and do the sequel
But his, nigga wasn't bout it, nigga wasn't bout it now
Feeling guilty, "What would Momma think about me?"
Told' him "Think about it nigga, won't you think about it now?"
But he was money hungry plus he trigger happy
So they hopped up in the Caddy, burnt his pack just like a Stevian
Thirty minutes later, blood is leaking at the ATM
Momma in denial, like her baby boy on trial
for a murder that he ain't commit, tears soak the handkerchief

[Chorus Two] + [Chorus One]

[Yo Gotti]
Fo real, fo real...
Lights off, no candles, roaches all around the kitchen
Nigga hungry, mom embarrassed so she don't want us to mention it
Grandma wanna help but mama ego kickin' in
She a hustler, she don't need no help raisin' her kids
Bills came, got evicted, stayed strong
Square bid'ness, she ain't never shown weakness, real shit
That created the hunger, and that make the monster
Got the game from our mama, that's some ill shit
13 on the block, he was a look out
In the kitchen, on the stove like it's a cook out
Young nigga doctored the game, could put a book out
Right when he thought it was over he got took out (bang!)
Brains leakin', nigga sneaked him, he ain't even seen it coming
He a hitta, he wasn't focus so he died over nothing
No revenge, with his friends, shootin' dice, bet again
Win or lose, bet it all, took out by his own men

[Chorus Two] + [Chorus One]

[Outro: J. Cole] + (Canei Finch)
They say the good die young, that's the truth
My nigga floatin' up in heaven now, that's the proof
I ain't make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me
Nigga maybe we can fly someday..
Ohh, we can fly someday..
Yeahh, up in the sky someday - hehe
Do real niggas get to heaven? That's that shit I ask the reverend
They say the good die young, that's the truth
My nigga floatin' up in heaven now, that's the proof
I ain't make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace
If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me
Nigga maybe we can fly someday (flyyyy)
Oh we can fly someday (flyyyy-yy)
Yeah up in the sky someday (skyyyy-y-y)
Do real niggas get to heaven? That's that shit I ask the reverend</pre>
