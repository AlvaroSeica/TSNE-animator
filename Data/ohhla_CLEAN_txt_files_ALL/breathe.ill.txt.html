[Verse 1]
It's the beginning of the 9th inning and I'm winning
You'll find me mind-bending inside of each five-minute time limit
And it's documented, we're breaking bones of contention
Fine tuning what's spinning and expanding my dominion
These upper-handed dimensions all contributed to the folklore
Got rappers raising their standards, fans demanding what they'd hoped for
Cramming letters in a bottle. We'll just call it a test tube
My style is Aristotle mixed with Krush Groove (So Just Move!)
And watch my verses cut through when you hear the words I Love You
Break off a piece of my heard tucked into every record groove
And you'll walk different in these corrective shoes
But you'll recognize the revolution and act out what most don't get to do
You'll take what's meant for you, no longer survive on what they pass down
Win or lose, you'll live your life knowing you never backed down
'Cause man shall not live by the bottle alone
I keep a fist raised to the sky so you can follow me home, it goes?

[Hook]
If you know like we know, BREATHE SLOW
BREATHE SLOW?(Repeat)

[Verse 2]
Until my body cracks the pavement and shakes the face of the basement
Lacing the foundation with scars that sacrifice is bound to leave
Break inner-city boundaries so suburbanites are down to see
This cultural way of life and how music is more than sound to me
But freedom's lungs are heavy from pushing these smoke signals out
And we've become so disillusioned that we're scared to notice
The eviction notice speaking its clout with screams and shouts, but trust me
Clarity's waiting there on the other side of your focus
So snatch the breath from blasphemy emphatically
Transform naturally, control the art before it masters me
Breathe slow and hold the hand of whoever you can reach for
Touch the ones you've never seen before 'til the common good is restored
'Til the homeless are all execs and capitalism yields to ethics
'Til janitors live in mansions and schoolteachers can push a Lexus
'Til beef is deaded and debt is erased or collected
'Til the projects and country clubs are now and forever connected
I'll speak my messages 'til they get it
Until you're touched by something sacred and love is all that you're left with
Blessed is the head that shares the crown that he possesses
Consider yourselves my brethren and this song is my confession
'Cause man shall not live by the bottle alone
I keep a fist raised to the sky so you can follow me home
And all your problems can't be solved by one call on the phone
I keep a fist raised to the sky so you can follow me home, it goes?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Right before you rock a show, BREATHE SLOW
When a promoter owes you dough, BREATHE SLOW
When your career doesn't blow [up], BREATHE SLOW
You bounced five checks in a row, BREATHE SLOW
If you're tired of being po, BREATHE SLOW
You can't see the status quo, BREATHE SLOW
You got more cons than pros, BREATHE SLOW
You got fisticuffs to throw, BREATHE SLOW
Ayo, your boss told you no, BREATHE SLOW
Say Mars ILL told you so, BREATHE SLOW
You gotta suffer to grow, BREATHE SLOW
Shine your light until you glow, BREATHE SLOW?
