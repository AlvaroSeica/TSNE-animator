Intro:
Girls man all around
Whether Julie Brown or Sexy Brown
Mr. Cat want fe put on a dub pon your sound
Che Dapper Dan up pon the damn microphone
Anyway now
Me a tell oonu

(Hook)
GirlsTown and girls all around
And Girls deh pon de catwalk an' a dem a come down
Oonu hear me
GirlsTown and girls all around
And girls deh pon de catwalk an' a dem a come down
Beautiful girl known from all over the world
Girl with physique and her hair full a curl
Sophisticated in diamond and pearl
Tell dem Mr. Cat an' him a one in the world

Verse 1:
Ayo
I like the way she moves
I like the way she moves it
Refuses or chooses
Excuses the losers
Gotta be the shoes
Avenues that she cruises
Stops all the music
Make us dudes lose it
Something outta movies
Dudes is mad talk
Some'll tryna hawk
Some'll tryna stalk
On the asphalt
Catcalls as you catwalk
Curves cut the curb
Broadway's your runway
I'mma be here from Monday to Sunday
Maybe I can get with you someday
I'm the girl watcher, spot cha
Quicker than a copper's
Radar detector
Then I game ya'll with lecture
Maybe later, I'll check ya
But she walks on by
Left with a fat lip as she passes me by
Moves to the far side but I gotta keep tryin
Soon as she walks away another one comes by
Oh well

(Hook)
GirlsTown and girls all around
And Girls deh pon de catwalk an' a dem a come down
Oonu hear me
GirlsTown and girls all around
And girls deh pon de catwalk an' a dem a come down
Beautiful girl known from all over the world
Girl with physique and her hair full a curl
Sophisticated in diamond and pearl
Tell dem Mr. Cat an' him a one in the world

Verse 2:
How I love the summertime
Want the sun to shine
 'Nother time
Cuz another dime
Wanna come and climb
Shotgun in my car
Drop top, go far
Dip down the highway
Destination my way
Beach or the streets
NYC Philly Queens Georgia Peach
M-I-A man I need one of each
In LA where they seem out of reach
Still I wanna reach
If she wanna meet
Maybe we can ride to a place more discreet
No sense having all our business in the streets
If you want a crowd
We can go when it's allowed
Music playing loud
I like my females like I like my cell
Nights and weekends free
When I'm out on the prowl
All shapes and sizes
Shades and I just
Feel surrounded
Sensory overload cause so many around us

(Hook)
GirlsTown and girls all around
And Girls deh pon de catwalk an' a dem a come down
Oonu hear me
GirlsTown and girls all around
And girls deh pon de catwalk an' a dem a come down
Beautiful girl known from all over the world
Girl with physique and her hair full a curl
Sophisticated in diamond and pearl
Tell dem Mr. Cat an' him a one in the world

Verse 2:
Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls I do adore
Man it's on when I see 'em in the mall
See 'em in the store
See 'em then I call
G' em like a pee-emp
When I fiend em like the chron'
M-m-m-Man I got the formula
Why pay an arm and a leg to get to callin ya?
Look but don't touch
For my eyes only
Move but don't rush
When you leave I die slowly
60 second crush
30 second flings
As she passes by
Another one'll bring
More chance for romance advances
I come with more game
I got all the answers
The pretty dimes with beautiful minds is mine
The ugly girls go to the rest of the world
Hardcore love songs from a G's perspective
Whenever they out on the streets I checks em out

Hook:
GirlsTown and girls all around
And Girls deh pon de catwalk an' a dem a come down
Oonu hear me
GirlsTown and girls all around
And girls deh pon de catwalk an' a dem a come down
Beautiful girl known from all over the world
Girl with physique and her hair full a curl
Sophisticated in diamond and pearl
Oh baby girl won't you let me in your world
I tell oonu
GirlsTown and girls all around
And Girls deh pon de catwalk an' a dem a come down
Oonu hear me
GirlsTown and girls all around
And Girls deh pon de catwalk an' a dem a come down

(Outro)
Girls Town
Girls man all around
Whether Julie Brown or Sexy Brown
Mr. Cat want fe put on a dub pon your sound
Che Dapper Dan up pon the damn microphone
