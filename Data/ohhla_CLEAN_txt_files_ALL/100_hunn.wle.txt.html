Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Wale]
I promised Ricky and Milly that I'ma kill it
Running throw up them digits on Dallas, homie I'm Emmitt
I'm running I'm so 100 with every nigga I run with
Tell them niggaz we coming, we fucking it up this summer

[Meek Mill]
And I'm stunting like it ain't nothing, most of these niggaz fronting
I pull this Rolly from Travi, and I got this Beamer from nothing
If they ain't talking bout paper, just tell them end of discussion
And now that I'm getting money, my neighbors turn to my cousins

[Wale]
Gold bottles, lot of bitches
Didn't think I'm sorry I'm such a shallow nigga
The mind on me just shine on them, you shadow women
Went out with rats you niggaz should be in glass slippers

[Meek Mill]
Ha, and I don't ever ask the price on it
Married to the money hater, throw some rice on it
I told my jeweler get my Mueller, throw some mimes on it
I treat that pussy like its Tina, I go Ike on it
Beat it up, I'm getting heated up
When I say I'm high, I ain't talking weed it up
[Wale]
Bitch I'm talking G5, Titobero, feet is up
Beaters on my sneakers, even though I never be with Dex
B and me, train hi up

[Meek Mill]
He lying I'm on papers
But when I beat this shit off, Ima go and buy some Lakers
Yea I'm talking bout that Cali kush, We can work in bolly push
Two bad bitches in the back, they prettier than ratty look

[Wale]
Bitch I'm hot as Wasabi in Abu Dhabi
In a sauna with some models who treat it like edamame
I ain't thugging, I ain't robbing, I'm puffing on my broccoli
Doing 100 in a bucket, be like 20 in a rari

[Meek Mill]
And I'm back on this shit again, Pressie blue like Michigan
I put on for my city I should ball with Vick and them
When I get my D12 I'ma be a Sixer then
Riding round with Looney and your sister and your sister's friend

[Wale]
Hold up
Got the fridgedest temperature on my wrist again
Trying to shit the niggaz is like giving children ritalin
Bobo sitting in the front, see you in a minute yo
And them haters went away as soon as I left Interscope

[Meek Mill]
Big money, I'm talking bad hoes
You niggaz full of shit, fucking assholes
I'm in this presidential suite, I'm in my bathrobe
Counting 100 grand I pulled in from my last show
Shitting on them, something I ain't mean to do
These hoes do anything, our wish is like a genie do
A nigga by a point, here take the nina too
I get a chick to come and serve you like Serena do

[Wale]
I think its genius when Lena do you in a group
Stunting, I'm in the sixth, I call that shit middle school
High as shit, I'm in a booth
Never nag them, Ima choose
And I don't gotta front, I play these niggaz like I wish em to
This is where the Wizards play, this is where them bitches play
Weed a have you falling, and now you scraping up that Kemba shape
The day a hater treat a nigga like he fake
That be the day his label treat him like his signal fade

[Meek Mill]
And I'm balling bitch, I'm balling bitch
Me Wale, so hard, this shit
Get your money budget back, fire all your artists-ess
We be burning everything, they label us as arsonists
If I ain't middle of the trap, I'm 106 and parkin' it</pre>
