[Intro]
Never be the same, never ("It's so hot")
The Beatnuts kid.. classic material (Yo.. hot shit)

[JuJu]
C'mon man, whattchu gotcha head in ya ass
It's The Beatnuts, put that other shit in the trash
(Uhh) Why niggaz always tryna hate?
Like everytime we drop we ain't put the fuckin heat in ya face
Come on ("It's so hot")
Think it's not? We ready to rock
Loaded with the macks to the back of ya knot
Still reppin for the kids on the block (yep)
And if you leave ya girl open (what) chances are I'm takin a shot
("It's so hot")

[Psycho Les]
This is that funk shit - get drunk and start punchin
niggaz in the face for bluffin
You won't see me posin on the cover of nothin
cuz I'm always on the low tryna cover up somethin
Big Pysche, I hit like a bulldozer
I see a chica with an ass like Trina, I tell her +Pull Over+
("It's so hot") Mama - that ass look proper
Take ya panties off and twist it round the air like a helicopter

[Chorus: Melonie + (Beatnuts)] - 2X
We.. got the funk (we got it!)
We got the funk (we got it!)
We.. got the funk (we got it!)
We got the funk (we got it!)

[JuJu]
Aiyyo girlfriend's dyin to leave
She lookin at me damn like "this faggot won't let me breathe"
Cuz you won't let her dance my shit
Mad at the fact the club jump when they bang my shit
("..so hot") and that's the way I'm keepin it homes
You got a problem? I suggest you leave it alone
(Man...) Later chump, I'ma go snatch me a hottie (uh-huh)
Crack a few beers man, bullshit and party

[Psycho Les]
Yes yes y'all (yes yes y'all)
Yes yes y'all (yes yes y'all)
I'm from Wonderpeople Corps - Pyscho Les y'all (Les y'all)
Beatnuts in the house
Hunnies wanna jerk and "beat nuts" in their mouth
and swallow it down
They're sayin shorty's in that new video
Yo turn it down, it be the same hoes at my shows buggin out
Make you pop, lock, do the ro-bot
It's The Beatnuts, everything we drop is.. ("..so hot")

[Chorus] - 2X

*Melonie vocalizing*

(we got it!) .. (we got it!)
You know we got it
Melonie, The Beatnuts (we got it!)
We keep it funky, everyday (we got it!)
That's it.. sorry it had to end this way
No more of these for you.. squeeze... hahaha</pre>
