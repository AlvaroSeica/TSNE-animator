Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Ya'll ain't feelin my hustle
Ya'll ain't feelin my stuggle
Dirty motherfuckers, they don't want me above them
Dear lord, why they hold they nuts on me
Dear lord, why they hold they nuts on me

I think it's time for me to sit down and run it with da lord
They don't wanna see me eat, I think they wanna see me strave
Want me to stand down, don't wanna let me go hard
Don't wanna see me on my feet, rather see me behind bars.
But I always keep my head up, cause I know that I'm gon make it.
My own blood hold they nuts on me, why they hate me?
Dear lord, why they hold they nuts on me
Maybe cause I'm 16 and I'm playin with g's
I ain't gon put'em in a front
But many niggas owe me sumthing
Like phat come thru summit and help me score me sumthing
But then turn around and stab me in my back
That's why I'm fuckin with myself cause I can't stab me in the back
Lord I'm a real nigga but they don't keep it real with me
A couple wanna do me sumthing that's why I keep that steel with me
The streets raised me so I know how to hustle
And I done found a way above'em cause they ain't feelin my stuggle

[Chorus: x2]
Ya'll ain't feelin my hustle
Ya'll ain't feelin my stuggle
Dirty motherfuckers, they don't want me above them
Dear lord, why they hold they nuts on me
Dear lord, why they hold they nuts on me

Yeah I'm young, but I get my grown man on
I go thru a lot of shit, but this lil young man strong
Put all my trust in myself, phat don't let me down
And I follow my first mind, phat ain't gon lead me wrong
I don't love nobody, ion trust nobody
I do my shit by myself cause these niggas ain't silent
Lord, {look here} I gotta problem with the streets
Cause these dirty motherfuckers won't let me shollow when I eat
Want me to spit it out and go right back to the bottom
But it's fucked up, cause they know that I got them
But it's ta the point if you ain't help me then fuck ya
Look what you done did ta me, damn it how you fuck me

Fa real {fa real}
I'm all I got {I'm all I got}
Fuck them niggas, phat you all I got {you all I got}
Fa real {fa real}
I'm all I got {I'm all I got}
Fuck them niggas, phat you all I got {you all I got}

[Chorus: x2]
Ya'll ain't feelin my hustle
Ya'll ain't feelin my stuggle
Dirty motherfuckers, they don't want me above them
Dear lord, why they hold they nuts on me
Dear lord, why they hold they nuts on me</pre>
