[Intro: 2Pac]
Cause I hate to spend
My life, my life, my life, my life (Lost Souls)
Duckin' one-time!
How it start, how it start

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Started off with, running from copses duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us
Living the life of trife juveniles, hoping for righteous
Gettin' twenty-five to life, if the judge don't like us
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin to get us
ATF state feds scandalous bitches
I wasn't promised to it, wasn't bitter or sweet
See if a, nigga don't hustle then the nigga don't eat
Only streets livin' do or die circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Living Thug Life, coming equipped, with many gats
Maybe I was just a Lost Soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life, and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain

[Chous: 2Pac/Outlawz]
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time! Stranded in the County in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost Souls...

Lost Souls nigga, for my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a Lost Soul

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time!

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
My brother Sean, first on my list he came home
Went back in and came back home again
And he just violate a parole
Now Uncle Sam wants the time he owe (damn)
Back to the system, Black and trapped in a prison
I miss him, it's just my brother don't listen
To nobody, hard headed, stuck in his ways
Won't change for nobody, all I could do is pray for him (pray for him)
And I'm praying for myself (for myself)
Trying to beat the odds with the cards that we was dealt
Young niggas need help (help), suicide rate is up higher than ever
Rest in peace to Randyz
Send my love to KRS and the family
We need to, try to make it through the struggle, it's family
They say rapping don't pay them bills (bills)
Trapping gon' pay them bills, but this ain't how we trying to live (damn)

[Chorus: 2Pac/Outlawz]
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine (sunshine)
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time!

One-time! One-time! One-time!

[Verse 3: EDI]
I been waiting on the rain to turn to sunshine for a long time (long time)
Stuck up on this grind, still wasn't mine (wasn't mine)
Lost a couple homies, missing comrades
But ain't no looking back, man we got to keep it cracking
Just had another birthday, guess I'm lucky
Triple 7's, mama's still here to hug me
My baby on the way, she need a whole lot (whole lot)
She gon' get what she need, that's on Pac (that's on Pac)
I used to love this shit but man did shit change
It's a shame, niggas pay to be made but uh
Some of the realest of people give it up (give it up)
Lost souls around the world looking for love, uh
Forever thugging on them hoes, right or wrong
Thug Life imbedded in me till I'm dead and gone
It's in my heart, in my flesh, in my soul
I used to be lost, but now I know

[Chorus: 2Pac/Outlawz]
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time!
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time!
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time!
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time!
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time!
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time!
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time!
