[Verse 1]
I used to make up sketches of the perfect companion
one with the right combo of passion and understandin
chillin on the stoop we would make up games
spin the bottle truth or dare but I was way too lame
till I met a chick in math class, her name was dawn
she was the first girl I knew that put make up on
I wanted to get wit her so I would make up lies
pretend that I was gettin money like those guys
on the ave who hustled 9 to 5 just to make up time
only came to school once a week cuz they was on the grind
begged my mom for a starter jacket and got 4
cuz I had mad deficiencies to make up for
so I started talkin back to teachers and actin up
I'd make up jokes that had the class crackin up
but I was only concerned with that one girl
with the make up, she made up my whole world

[Hook]
You see we, make love and fight then we lust
Then we make up undress and mess up your make up again
(we're going upside down, round and round again)

[Verse 2]
it was a rainy day, I was supposed to walk home with the fellas
I made up an excuse, cause I saw dawn wit no umbrella
although it belonged to my moms, I gave it to her anyway
I was too shy to talk so I started to walk away
until she said, you might as well stay till the bus come
this is the kinda situation the old me would run from
but I came back, put on my act, played it cool like them cats
who would sit in the back, of the classroom
I cracked jokes, talked about people walkin by
and she laughed at em, I was officially livin a lie
cuz I knew if she had known that I was geek,
that was from the streets, but far from street, I aint have a chance
then feelings started rushin like an avalanche
bus was comin, so I just grabbed her hand,
wrote my number in her palm wit my bic pen
and we been goin steady since then, ha!

[Hook]
You see we, make love and fight then we lust
Then we make up undress and mess up your make up again
(we're going upside down, round and round again)

[Verse 3]
one day I showed up at the rest, decided I would surprise her
she didnt have no makeup on I didnt recognize her
I had to make up an excuse cuz I aint have a spine
but I dont want a girl who's only pretty part time
then she busted me, had the nerve call me a hypocrite
said I aint the only one lyin, you aint no differ-ent
she knew that I made up lies about hust-lin
knew I got all my cool clothing from my mother and
the sad part was that she liked me for me
and I hid behind the same insecurities
that she fell for, tryin to be somethin that I was not
she said I liked uou, way before the bus stop
she said not only can we not hang together
I just got an NES we coulda gamed together
so I guess the moral is, work wit what ya got
better to be hated for what ya are than loved for what ya not

[Hook]
You see we, make love and fight then we lust
Then we make up undress and mess up your make up again
(we're going upside down, round and round again)</pre>
