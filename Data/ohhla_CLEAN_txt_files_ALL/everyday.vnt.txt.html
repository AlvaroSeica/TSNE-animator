[Vents]
Looking pale, ready to hurl
The face of a brand new world
Nothing to lose, caught between Heaven and Hell
I've got nothing but my time and my soul to sell
The power to think and the instinct to rebel
You tell me to chill with the booze and the pills
But the drugs is pure bliss, give me something to feel
Something that's real, something I could really believe
in a world where god stopped breathing
I'm leaving with nothing but these two hands
You could call me a prick, I'm a slave, I'm a man
I'm a stiff with a plan, I'm a flash in the pan
I'm a brick in the wall, a footprint in the sand
I'm the generation that came and went, and left nothing but cigarette
butts and porn on the Internet, get it yet?
I'm waiting for that beautiful conflict to start
When, every day is a blast

[Chorus: 2X]
Tear it down (tear it down), blow it up (blow it up)
Rebuild it (rebuild it), what the fuck? (what the fuck?)
Making sure every day is a blast
"Bucka (Bucka) Bu-Bucka (Bu-Bucka) Bucka (Bucka) Blaow~!" - M.O.P.
Come on~!

[Vents]
Yeah, the higher I get, the lower I fall
Waiting by the phone, the more I said I love her mean the less she called
The more I owe, the sicker I get
and one man's wealth is another man's debt, never forget
You could say what you want, but please shut your mouth
and watch what you eat, every calorie count
Gotta watch what I'm smoking, drinking, snorting
The more I do, the more life get boring
I breathe deep in the morning
But I breathe shallow at night without a care in sight
I feel something in the air tonight
Cigarettes and girls, everything alright, everything I like
Set the place alight, make it burn like a church in Norway
Huh, skip the foreplay
What's the forte? Part-ay
till my brain go soft and the wheels fall off, what?

[Chorus: 2X]

[Vents]
Say nah, we not going to bed
Hell no, we not going to bed
(Just go to sleep)
Say nah, we not going to bed
Nah nah, we never going to bed
(Just go to sleep)
Nah, we not going to bed
Hell nah, we not going to bed
(Time to go to sleep, yeah)
We never going to bed
Say nah, we not going to bed
Get the fuck to sleep~!

[Chorus: 2X]</pre>
