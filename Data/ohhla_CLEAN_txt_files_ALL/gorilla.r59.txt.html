[Intro]
Yeah (Statik Selektah). Royce Da 5'9", Statik Selektah, my nigga Preme
This is the Bar Exam. Gorilla camp nigga

[Verse One]
If you ain't callin' me king
Fuck it the mayor will
You think you fly
Then you about as high as a Ferris wheel
You not dope
You like soap
I'm like coke
It's like comparing Clearasil to Seroquel
But there is still too many things to name 'em all
We ain't the same
You niggas is dames in trainin' bras
I get brain from bitches with big tits
You got a dick with shit stains
I hits the hangy ball
That's the deep throat for niggas that don't get it
It's so hopeless
Bet they can only blow smokin'
No jokin'
I'm chrome kitted
Whenever you see me ridin'
Unless I'm in Hollywood, gold spoken
My shit kicks the loudest
My chick's kicks is Prada
The big body Benz is sick
Kicks is Bravis
Switch out and tell the Impala
To sit as high as a big dick toddler
Bitch, get dollars
I don't kick knowledge
I quit college for hip hop
If I get violent
You probably should kick rocks
Verbally vivid
Lyrically clear
Snitches shouldn't be murdered
They should just be livin' in fear
They should just be raped
No homo
My professional hit mens
Will merk for me and they work pro bono
New engine
Too sickenin'
Me and web
Got the hood up on the block watchin' the new Pistons

[Outro]
Shout out to my nigga Will. This is the Bar Exam nigga
Hip hop is alive. Royce just got out of jail</pre>
