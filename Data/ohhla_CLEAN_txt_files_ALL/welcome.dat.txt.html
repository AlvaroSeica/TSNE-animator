[Da TR.U.T.H.]
Let's go- I know the culture will
Teach us to be self absorbed
We ain't supposed to be self absorbed
I know we live in America- in the era of the self exhorters
Where the music on the shelf's distorted
And the wealth is sordid
Sure as the locust will fly
Everywhere, we look the focus is I
But we got to say byeÂ—bye why
'Cause in the Kingdom of God, you know, my plus I got to die
Takes more than I to survive, so we stand fortified
Salvation is ours- like four to five
Or six to seven
Got to stick with the brethren
Break bread, pitch tents together
And let's gather
Rather than stand alone
Don't stand a chance if we stand on our own
'Cause we're prone to stray
All affected when a bone is fray
We need each other that's been thrown away
Let's get it back now

[Chorus]
If you're ready to get it going
Everybody in the building says- welcome to The Faith
Where "the" is the definitive article and
God's got men and women with a heart of gold</pre>
