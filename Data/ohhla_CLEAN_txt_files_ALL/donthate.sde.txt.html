This goes out to all the ones, them haters
Whether a bitch or a ho
Some of these players are bitches too
It's all elementary
Sideways in the mouth of other players
Don't ask me why
Guess that's just the way it is

[Sideways]
Now why in the world would a playa like me envy
Cuz these fools always sendin' me
Mixed signals red yellow green
And if you got fetti then you know what I mean
It seems everybody's actin' playa parts when I'm climbin'
By me side and cuz I'm triple gold ridin'
Money hungry freaks, fools who know beats, where you hidin'?
Roughed up some playas from my days like a soldja
Everybody know I thought I told ya
Talk all you want still holdin' my composure
East double O, O double Bay-Bay
How it goes cuz you know I got ladies
In my back fade, in my back pack
All the crack backs lookin' for them 10 and 20 sacks
Found the fun wit a freak late night
Game tight so I might as well recite
Playin' the change, spittin' game to a dame
Livin' that life critically acclaimed
Captain Kangaroo straight shakin' us all
Who's to say I'm faster than innocence in a par-ty
Mr. PHD, got my blood warmin' like 100 degrees
So please this ain't dynasty
Tryin' to be a nominee recipe, H-A-T-E
Tweedle dee, tweedle dum
Leave you in delirium, fe-fi-fo-fum
Premium, the EP platinum
Gums flappin', cuz you can't fade rappin'
Slap you in the mouth with a dose no joke
Hoes with the most
Chop the game not coke I hope
Feel me Sideways in the cuts
Double trouble phonies end up being lonely
Nigga rows and hoes all know the game plan
Green fettuccini mixed with my steak man
This goes to those who chose to not relate see
I put it plain like this don't hate me</pre>
