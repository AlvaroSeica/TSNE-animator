Hey little miss mama
why don't you let me put you on ok ma?
That little young nigga they figure take over someday so
why don't you hop up on it
these are the suckas I know up on it

better than me hmm girl I doubt it.
So tell me why you trippin when I'm blazin scouty pippin?
but I'm the main event so you know I'm go out and get it
Mrs.Simmons may I please call you cause it sounds so nicely
never ever woulda thought that at fifteen I woulda done found my wifey
she just so bad wit it got a walk like a model
got the perfect shape make me wanna sip out that coke bottle mmm
with a swag on full throttle
I'm tryin to G her like there ain't no such thing as tomorrow
so Mrs. Fine please let me go and tell you why
you gotta be mine
cause girl you are one of a kind
stop wasting time cause baby

so we can talk all about us till the end of the night

[Chorus]
You should roll with us girl
We got what you need girl
If you wanna roll with me girl
Don't waste no time girl

Imma put you on girl (yeah) ah-ah-aha
Imma put you on girl yea-ah

[Chris Brown]
Breezy be my name I'm fresher than a pair of shoes
and haters mad cause I'm flyer than a parachute
don't mean my dog when I say my car got no roof
walk in my house all my breezy's got on swim suits
get it wet then I swim through
then I take her to the venue
she like to do me
I eat sushi
she's my menu
I lace her up (lace her up)
Michael Jordan's(Jordan's)
fix lense my life's recording
cuz I need all that tell me where them dollars at
you got a problem I adjust it like a starter cat
me and Diggy gone we on nigga
he underage I'm grown nigga
but I bet yo wifey know all the words to our song nigga (nigga)
she fantasizing bout Mr. Right and your the wrong nigga (haha)
I'm kerosene heated
spitting like I'm bulimic
I live it you niggas dream it

You should roll with us girl
We got what you need girl
If you wanna roll with me girl
Don't waste no time girl

Imma put you on girl (yeah) ah-ah-aha
Imma put you on girl yea-ah [x2]</pre>
