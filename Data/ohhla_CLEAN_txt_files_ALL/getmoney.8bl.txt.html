[Eightball]

Big Eightball straight up out the south to you
honey coated money fool that's all I wanna do
spit dope that a nigga sat at the crip
and rolled me and philly phil on that flight
always tight all night sleepy niggas don't get paid
they get made into broke niggas everyday
i'm on some finance increased raps and beats
hip-hop glock poppin' hollow point heat
what you boys need I got it by the pidound
straight up out the midound make everybody get down
sandy brown blades ways in a daze damn
ain't eightball at the mall with the brades
hey don't get fly cuz I can get fly too
cruisin' in a six double 0 right by you
from the bayou to the hudson I be bustin'
but if it ain't about money it ain't about nothin'

[Busta Ryhmes and Eightball]

its all about money
this one goes to my niggas gettin' money
always on the grind 
this one goes to my bitches gettin' money
if it ain't about money
this one goes to my hustlers gettin' money
don't waste my time
this one goes to my thugs gettin' money
see its all about flippin'
this one goes to my niggas gettin' money
tryin' get you a lick
this one goes to my bitches gettin' money 
if it ain't about money 
this one goes to my thugs gettin' money
then it ain't about shit

[Eightball]

sometimes baby all about my E-N-D's
in the N-Y chillin' with B-U-S-T
we tight puttin' green sticky in the wind
blend with flipmode tryin' make a million
been pimpin' limpin' down 1-2-5
yellow cab Abdul and I gettin' high
9-1-7 roamin' long distance 
Busta Ryhme come and gimme some asistance

[Busta Ryhmes]

floss I see millions with my affilians
my money bought the weed but I'm askin' where the philly went
money stack on the wall with Eightball
money Flipmode and Suavehouse takin' it all money
now we corporate bossy icy and frosty 
maximize the cream cuz its costly to be flossy
gimme my money gimme my yen gimme my peso
before my gat has to say so 

(Chorus)(2X)

[Busta Ryhmes]

I said hey yo sonny first of all gimme my money
some much money we gettin' it ain't even funny
little corny niggas be tryin' take my money from me
when in they face bloody and leave 'em in the gully
givin' stupid niggas some money and watch 'em turn dummy
then he fuck up his money up in the streets rummy
my money and your money ain't even compatible
then I turn savage and cannibal if you ain't got my capital
money to eat money to hold heat money for flowers
lots of money to own streets money from sellin' cassetes
money and assets money I be givein' and I ain't even ask yet

invest in loyal niggas on the street
