[Talking]
It's B.Gizzle ya number one original hot boy
nigga already know whassup with me
nigga already know my status
if you don't know you better ask somebody, look

[Chorus - B.G.Repeat 2X]
I'm B.Gizzle I'm a motherfuckin real nigga
I left Cash Money, my money got real bigger
you never catch me in the streets without the steel nigga
I'm out the hood so I get it how I live nigga

[Verse 1 - B.G.]
You know me I'm a solider no doubt
my reputation already confirm what I'm about
I'm a hustler you can always catch me in the streets
puttin it down, makin moves cause Gizzle gotta eat
feds tryna lock me up and throw away the key
they know I gotta enough work well I could throw away a ki
if you wanna get on ya feet then holla at me
can't sell 'em for ten but I can throw 'em for sixteen
I chase that money and I stack that money
bitch nigga try to play me I'm a smash that dummy
I ain't playin with you niggaz go on and run up on a G
they'll be callin, tellin ya momma her son is in the street
how you want it, you can get - how you want it, I can bring it
you wanna early funeral trust me I can arrange it
I'm a man about my mine no reppin, no stuntin
New Orleans is the dungeon so what you talkin is nothin

[Chorus - B.G.Repeat 2X]
I'm B.Gizzle I'm a motherfuckin real nigga
I left Cash Money, my money got real bigger
you never catch me in the streets without the steel nigga
I'm out the hood so I get it how I live nigga

[Verse 2 - B.G.]
Okay a man always look another man in his eye
I'm talkin to you - you lookin at the ground I know why
you a busta, you a fake, you a bitch, you a lame
you should've stayed on the porch you ain't ready for the game
got my first stripe at twelve, second stripe at thirteen
third stripe a year later then pronounced the B.G.
fourth stripe at fifteen now I'm captain of the team
I was suppose to be at school, but on the corner sellin weed
before I made eighteen I'm a sargeant now
fuckin hoes, gettin money sellin quarters now
before I made twenty one I was a lieutenant
it's a war goin on and dogg I'm all in it
I ain't tryna turn back this my life I'm a live it
I ain't gotta come now so if you trip I'm a send it
I'm in full command I'm the Chopper City general
so believe it's nothin to get rid of you

[Chorus - B.G.Repeat 2X]
I'm B.Gizzle I'm a motherfuckin real nigga
I left Cash Money, my money got real bigger
you never catch me in the streets without the steel nigga
I'm out the hood so I get it how I live nigga</pre>
