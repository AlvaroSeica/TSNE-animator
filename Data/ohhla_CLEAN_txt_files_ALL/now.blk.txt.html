(Chorus repeat 2x)
(Dark Half)
I'm on my feet now, shit never was it sweet now
Belly but I'm still starve can I eat now, live complete
Now, told by the older god never put the heat down

Verse One: Dark Half

Far from reper humbo meat now fuck with
The winners bitches listen when I speak 
Got on some rap shit find it hard to creep
Now I'm on point and move deep more relete
Could Clap you but ain't nothing like a baet down
We swept down these streets now like community
sevrivce reach your faith face defeat now we
Hipadument get in your skin niggas want beef now
Bring It on when we borm ain't no rebound the war on son 
No time for sleep now get your guns no surrender no retreat
now you violated dog blood got alete ypur whole life is down hill intype
Deep down its deep now watch and seperate 
The wolf from the sheep now
May you rest ever last in peace regons compete
This year isare year knowlegde

Chorus(Wais instead of Dark Half)
verse Two: wais
Aiyyo, half Wais is on this crawl thorough
Doing ten miles per on a sneak with no doubt
In for way make the gun peak out just to sent a
Message let for shots sneak out front I don't
Hesitate to reach now you think you nice but
Your dealer, your contract can conpreach now 
Chicken uses to front but they on my meat now 
Catch me in the park after dark with seats down
I was known for emeny layin your feet down 
Now I'm known for shit one hundred degrees
Now my style use to be just sick but its diesease
Now take a one on one to this catch ya freeze now
Death to enemys, life to thw family peace to my
Killers up north who ever ran with me I'm still moving
With the canners g for the money there no problem
Pleanin the asanding
