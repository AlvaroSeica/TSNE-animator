[Intro: Crunch Lo]
We Othorized, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage

[Molly-Q]
We came saw and conquered, Ironfist marching archer
Spark bullseye, just for starters, my heart robbers
Cromadart flips from techs to pillage, kid
We family, drop kicks, caught in the death wish
My state as I regulate, ice cold like Bering Strait
Prepare what the genie gave, bloodbath Frank
Clean-up hitter, samurai swing, the head splitter
Talk litter, now your shiver in the shower, kill a nigga!
Kick ass, bite tits, leave your money on these grits
Thin line between love and hate, ain't budging and ain't try calling you a snitch
But dug a ditch, what it ain't, RBs and black rose in advance
We overtake the master, big source of racketeer
E.D.I. see the fear, got all in that ass
Came busting, I am in the struggle, Othorized F.A.M.
We had to bubble, stone face, hard rocks, crush it down into rubble

[Chorus: Crunch Lo]
We Othorized, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage
We OTF, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage

[Shawn Wigs]
Son, we broke from the bricks, banned from the streets
Monkey flip niggas, tear ass with they cleats
Reach for the Ironfist Pillage, righteous fist killings
Villains, we thugs for the thrillings

[Crunch Lo]
Bad habit, spilling into your lives
We taken your wives, big swords or butterfly knives
Go head and chop them, care about nothing
Straight off the rocka, stalked in the dark and got to drop them
Jumped off, make me dumped off and checked out
Leaped from your torso, spit blood from your mouth

[Shawn Wigs] (Crunch Lo)
We the block rockers, tearing it up from out the bang
(Inside murder) Iron Fist swing
(Kingpin call shots, we take over blocks)
And burned through the streets, and crashed like big stocks
(Give up everything, revolt like Kroatian
Move from the land (cuz it's ours for the taking)
Higher education, full violation
Third world niggas cause havoc through migration
(Head to head confrontation) so never think twice
(Crossing through our path, you might lose your life)

[Chorus]

[Lounge Lo]
Now I see the good side is turning back
We play the hood like Bank and Thad
I run up in the gate and spanked ya lab
Twist something, flip something, spit, shank your dad
The Mac-double-one in the stash, and ready for blast
Talk is cheap, now that's why I keep it low with the heat
White boys, black boys running the street
Double guns (guns), I roll with nothing but the troubled ones
Ain't nothing sweet when you fucking with us
I play the elevator shaft with my finger ready to bust
First floor, territory turf raw
My Iron Fist out to hurt y'all, I got a crew called The Pillage
Watch how I kill it up in your skillet
It's Lounge Lo, Othorized F.A.M., we still building

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Crunch Lo]
The Pillage, The Pillage!</pre>
