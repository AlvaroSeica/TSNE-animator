(gun shot)
Man get yo punk ass down
Come on let's go let's go, shots, we out
Fuck all y'all homeboys, yeah that's what I said

[Kurupt]
All up in the shadows with calico's in the fo'
Dippin' in my lo-lo I'm a mutha fucking fool
G stands for gangsta first and foremost
Posting with my pistols, holding my pose
MC dipping not giving a fuck
Kurupt slide, Daz roll I'm shotgun in the ride
Like nigga did you see that motherfucker over there?
The first motherfucker with his hood in the air
Round up the homies in the park
12 double-O, afternoon check the homies heart
Shit's about to spark, thunderdome popping off
When you checking niggas heart they start dropping off
I'm a gangsta a gangsta, a bitch is a bitch
Change up and switch fuck around and then snitch
Walk, gangstas just walkin'
Talking that gangsta talk with that gangsta walk
Count the homies off by the tens, and rows of fives
If we all don't get the fuck in we ride
That's how the gangstas move, I'm a G, I'm a fool
I'm a dip, I'm a trip if you want me to
I'm a ride, I'm a slide, with that gangsta glide
I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga

[Chorus]
When you see me in the street best believe I got heat
I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga
On the grind living life in the fast lane motherfucker
I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga
Making money and the fame for a mutha fucking gangsta nigga
I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga
When you see me in the street best believe I got heat
I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga

[Kurupt]
You thought you had a grip, well we did too
That's why me and the homies decided to come through
Whip out the pistol, snatch off his head real quick
Bitch nigga, where the fuck did you stash the grip
On some gangsta shit 'cause gangstas make the world go 'round
Whip out the fo' pound, dump 'cause he's moving around
I bet he never move again, the next time a motherfucker say stay down
On the ground, I bet he won't make a sound
This is G land nigga, Thailand nigga
Lulla-bye, high, do or die land nigga
Gangstas like fuck a bitch, hit the streets, hit a switch
Me and D-a-z like bitch pay me
That's how a gangsta moves, I'm a G, I'm a fool
I'm a dip, I'm a trip if you want me to
I'm a ride, I'm a slide, with that gangsta glide
I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga

[Chorus]

[Kurupt]
Have you ever once looked back, looked into the mirror
Saw your self falling flat, like where the fuck am I at?
I'm sick of this shit, I'm a put it all on the line
Before Daz start slapping bitches out they mind
Like bitch you wanna get slapped out your mind?
Bitches I'm a tell ya one more time, see
We can do anything, pull any ho
Do anything we wanna do don't you know
Kurupt and Daz, Daz and Kurupt, lick it up
I'm a aqua-boogie with a bitch walking up and down the strip
Not giving a fuck bitch, Daz dropping gangsta shit
It's nine let's get high, ya ho's need a ten
This is G land nigga, Thailand nigga
Lulla-bye, high, do or die land nigga
Gangstas like fuck a bitch, hit the streets, snatch a snitch
Me and D-a-z G, bitch pay me
That's how a gangsta moves, I'm a G, I'm a fool
I'm a dip, I'm a trip if you want me to
I'm a ride, I'm a slide, with that gangsta glide
I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga

[Chorus]
When you see me in the street best believe I got heat
I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga
On the grind living life in the fast lane motherfucker
I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga
See me, it ain't a thang for a mutha fucking gangsta nigga
I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga
When you see me in the street best believe I got heat
I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga, I'm a gangsta nigga
