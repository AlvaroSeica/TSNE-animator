[Intro: Babyface Fensta]
Yeah...

[Chorus 2X: Babyface Fensta]
Can't, stop telling the truth
Won't, stop feeding the youth
Don't, stop, rock the hip hop
Can't stop, won't stop, don't stop, drop

[Babyface Fensta]
Remain hard like hell, who stink?
Like stale urine, I crush like slush
Under my boots, roots is deep, don't sleep
I rest, blow like clusters, flow nuts on trick ass busters
Take one to the dome, son, your shines dull like platinum
I'm the bomb like Hiroshima, sneak attack, Pearl Harbor
Pearl Harbor, my anger, hinges on murder
Caution, there's danger, first to major
Embrace my ten best, tamper with my temper
Yahweh shalom the serpent, magna charter
Sware to platinum magnum, a diamond fleet collar
A Scooby snack, cuz Scrappy likes to holla about nothing

[Chorus 2X]

[Babyface Fensta]
Out for one, omega red, begin sequence
Commence countdown, end feedback
Fed up with shiesty contracts
Rally, behind my manifest destiny
Drive the addict, strength of Asia
No longer invincible, I'm your shadow
The spook who stood behind the door
Yo Maverick, I got a bogey, six o'clock if you copy
Altitude two thousand feet and climbing
Zero in, on his position, bomb the perimet'
All four sides, recon the length and fucked the area
They gone in circles, find they circumference
Achieve a mind state, store and sort information
Like a computer, spin my web, browse my page, she gauge ya brain
High voltage, be on the lookout, for software pirates
High voltage, be on the lookout, for software pirates, pirates, pirates, pirates

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
