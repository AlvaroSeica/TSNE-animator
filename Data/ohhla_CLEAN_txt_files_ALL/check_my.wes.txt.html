[Maestro Fresh Wes]
My rhymes are stinging like a killer bee
My cometition are wishing that killing me
For my similies and solioquies
They garbage, but I'm the largest
With the hardest style to disregard
Check your cartridge, on your tech-niques
Wes speaks, over the best beats
Fresh until the next week
I'm outlandish, I bandage the mic bringing anguish
I'm sturdy when doing the dirty language
And, it's time for me to raise my velocity
No animosity, my philosophy's a prophecy
Hipocracy, no that's the cameleon
How old are you evein(?), they rhyming like comedians
They make me laugh because they styles are scrupulous
My body is my temple, my brain is my nucleus
A great exapmle of Allah's perfection
You're moving to the sounds of my fat selection
I'm simply spectacular, smooth like an Acura
Yo, check my vernacular

You need to devote more...
Time into rhyming if you're hoping for dope scores of folklore
Creating a style and grow with it
Be prolific don't solicit
Be scientific, if it's wack go visit
The department of labour, the harder flavour
You can't savour, do rap a favour be a waver
In the front row, where the stunts go
'Cause the chumps know you can't flow
Plus, you're too gun ho
My rhymes are bionic, far from demonic
My phonics are supersonic, you're embryonic
I spray you like insecticide or pesticide
Let's decide the best vibe for Wes to ride
Cool, time for me to synchronize bass and highs (for my enterprise)
I'm simply spectacular, smooth like an Acura
Yo, check my vernacular

Break it down

I'm smoother than the Philharmonics with my killer phonics
And melodic, shit I'm fucking iller than a fill of chornic
On the streets I'm known, I use a sheet to bone
On the sneak, Dominique Simone
Thicker than Hagan Dasz, bitches stop and pause
Niggas stocking yards, pass me cars, I'm knocking jaws
Biter flee, recognizing me
Wrecking title gee, 'cause inside of me is like Hepatitis B
I'm a whirlwind, fireballs I'm hurling and swirling
No discussion, I'm crushing walls of Berlin
Seen many thesauruses, pleny clitoruses
Ready to score with this, huh, packing punch like Terry Norrises</pre>
