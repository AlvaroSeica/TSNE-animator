[Hopsin]
They call me Hop, the kin of this hip-hop
The moment that I hopped in the game, it got hot
Rappers thought that they would be ruinin' my plots
In this industry but homie I'm doin it for alot
Soon as I step up the flow, niggaz know that I'm untouchable
With the mic I'mma cut ya throat, guess its cause I'm so rugged yo rugged yo
I'm keepin it real fuck the dough, I'm lyin homie I love it yo
I'm a beast at this, I ain't really unleashed it yet
Obviously I have I'm just bad at keepin it secretive
And if you do wanna piece of this, budda you could recieve it quick
Yeah I know that you sayin fuck hopsin hes a dick
I gave the sheets a click of how I metamorph the game?
I'mma rack it off the chain, till my records off to plays
Spread a web across ya name
Make sure you suckin it, grab ya belt and buckle it
Time to end all this fuckin shit

[Chorus]
I got some flows and they super duper nice
Just gimme' a dope beat and ill be super duper tight
Lace it up, sell it for a super duper price, (WHY, WHY)
Cause I'm super super fly
Hey I'm so fly (FLY) look at me flyin away
(I can fly, I can fly) HEY
(I can fly, I can fly) HEY (I can fly)

[Hopsin]
Now the bomber slick, throw as my words astonish 'em
We comin in different change it up that's what I'm promising
Yeah you got potential and all a that but you not as sick
Someone tell these lowdown and dirty fuckers who Hopsin is!
Its been awhile, feels like five hundred years
But the apocalypse is finally here, a lot of these queers just run around thinkin that they hot
But they cold as fuck, when I drop that shits gon be over then y'all gon' know wassup
Niggaz actin like that they hate to show love, till they find out what I'm capable of
I'm finna fizz up like baking soda, put so much pressure on you niggaz
you'll be forced to exit the game, cause my games is so tough
But you motherfuckers is probably gonna keep on comin back like roaches
But I have the potion, outwit you just like a pack of vultures
Cause I rap ferocious y'all lack emotion that's needed in this
I beez the business what can I say I just need to win it

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
My image doesn't appear to be viscous, but just by hearin me whip this
I'm sure that you could tell I'm lyrically gifted
It's a conspiracy, is it? Definitely - if you step to diss me
I'll make sure you rest in hippies once you got my record in me
Evidently I'm known to kill this devil in me
You can tell it's in me, my flow has been mastered elegantly
If you fellas tip me it's cause you feelin the jealous envy
Next I put one thought up in before you sell ya cd
I wouldn't say that I'm the father of rap
But Rapfather died so I just adopted his ass
Since none a y'all will take him in, watch what I'ma make of him
This nigga fin' to be the motherfuckin hottest thin again
Y'all been treatin the game wrong, man hopsin ain't ya friend
I ain't takin back none a my words fuck who they defend
Y'all claimin that you niggaz from the hood and the streets
Then why's the fuckin game Hollywood as can be?

[Chorus]</pre>
