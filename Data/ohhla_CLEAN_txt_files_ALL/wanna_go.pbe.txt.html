Now what sound of my dj cuts
Terminator¹s back on some ol¹ fools track
Takes a nation of sellouts to keep us back
Flippin disco raps used to be whack
Now what you hear is what you lack
Take a lil bit of this a lil bit of dat
Who dropped the bomb on hip hop
Who got biggie and who shot tupac
What¹s forgot / ain¹t no eazy, no scott larock
Now what¹s rap gotta do wit what you got
For whom the bell tolls
Is that the way the story goes  
85% believing all the videos
God knows / who controls the radios
Some people chose the road to be hoes
And so i rose / in the middle of all the woes
And def jam / negroes turnin up their nose
There¹s one way in no way out
No doubt the body count
Gettin headz checkin out

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down

Time to make life shine again like glass
Gotta make it shine like glass

Outraged against the scene
Proofread the script
Flipped it back so i¹m back in gang green
We interrupt this routine i had a dream
Da clean protein smacked the gangsta lean
Between the triple team
Wiped em out like a drought
Damn i¹m raps tetracycline
Them lips foretold these apocalypse
Everything had a shot
And got hit wit bullshit
Twisted politics tricks i couldn¹t get wit
As one quits another nitwit hits
All the way crazy, shady 
World turned upside down
I put it down 
Why destroy what you love 
Look around 
Surrounded by chalk marks on the ground
Where the lost got found
Why it all come tumblin down
Why he and she gotta die
Now how dat sound

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down

On &amp; on to the break a dawn
Some the 100 meter dash i¹m the marathon
Been around a long time
But the rhyme the same
Sound remains insane
Exchange the reign
Ain¹t that somethin
Figure i smashed the pumpkin
So i parallel the brains of cobain
Show no shame like the pain of kane
Gettin madd opposition hip to the game
It¹s that gran ol¹ pe ammo
Different time different channel
Funky piano
Here to witness get on up with a quickness
S1¹s in the house
Wit the thickness that get dis
1 2 3 4 5 attackin they frat
Griff is back got 5 on it black
The track got x on the decks
Terminators back cause a dat is whack
On the 1 and 2
Yeah go flavor
Pe hit the road gettin set to explode
Fight the power for peace
Can¹t forget the war mode
Overload
There she blows
Here we go
Now you know 
Damn another alamo

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
