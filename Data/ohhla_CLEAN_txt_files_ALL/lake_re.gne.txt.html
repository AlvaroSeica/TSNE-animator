[Chorus] [Eligh]
When G &amp; E is in the flesh
We fresh with styles
Take it to the crowd
Sing it out loud
With your palm to the god if your sick of facades 
And you wanna go down to the lake for a break
Take this journey
Don't be scared, be prepared 
From the light that shines
From the top of the spine
Not the mind to the mouth, creativity release

[Verse One] [Eligh]
Sitting by the lake
Skipping stones, rippin' poems 
Thinking about what I gotta do next 
For the moment trying to get my chi in the zone 
All alone on a park bench reading through text 
Hard to get my shit together when the brain is forever on dough 
Green light let it off go 
Then I'm all of elbow to the gat when I'm on float, hope 
Sitting by the lake can inspire me fire me up cause I'm bored 
On the back of a pickup truck 
Tryin' to pick up luck like a passer by 
When everything I need to survive is inside 
On the ride of a life time 
Come on to bring on the ultimate goal 
God helps my soul 
Like a pot of gold 
When the pot gets old 
I stop drop and roll to the next plateau 
Thats a couple of thoughts thats passed me 
Like traffic on the 1-0-1 
Reflection eternal this section is here especially by the lake thats one

[Chorus] [Eligh]
When G &amp; E is in the flesh
We fresh with styles
Take it to the crowd
Sing it out loud
With your palm to the god if your sick of facades 
And you wanna go down to the lake for a break
Take this Journey
Don't be scared be prepared 
From the light that shines
From the top of the spine
Not the mind to the mouth, creativity release

[Verse Two] [The Grouch]
When the world is heavy on my shoulders I can't get a grip
I take a break or to the lake there I can skinny dip
Watch me skip a rock across the greatest body of water
In it I see no limit just reflections make me holler
I'm a baller I got balls I rest 'em at the lake edge 
Mother Earth supports my stress cause people often fake it
Splash I make it last til the sun can't even take
I have a conversation with crickets cause I'm sick
When I kick it

[Chorus] [Eligh]
When G &amp; E is in the flesh
We fresh with styles
Take it to the crowd
Sing it out loud
With your palm to the god if your sick of facades 
And you wanna go down to the lake for a break
Take this Journey
Don't be scared be prepared 
From the light that shines
From the top of the spine
Not the mind to the mouth, creativity release

Release release release 

[Chorus] [Eligh]
When G &amp; E is in the flesh
We fresh with styles
Take it to the crowd
Sing it out loud
With your palm to the god if your sick of facades 
And you wanna go down to the lake for a break
Take this Journey
Don't be scared be prepared 
From the light that shines
From the top of the spine
Not the mind to the mouth, creativity release</pre>
