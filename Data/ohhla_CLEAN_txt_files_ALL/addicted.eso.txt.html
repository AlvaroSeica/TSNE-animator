Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I was born in the 80's with that summertime love
Then changed the whole game like what have I done
Out the gutter I come
To touch the bright sun
And from the highest heights motherfucker I jump

Free in the sky of belief I can fly
Ain't no tellin what they're sellin man they're sheep in disguise
Keep this in mind, I keep on my grind
I can do it anyway I want to do it and
Bitch I'll sleep when I die
Explosive, ferocious, get up get down that's showbiz
Power to the people that have freedom and their focused
I hope this helps you when your under the thumb
When you feel like nothing can save you
When you feel like jumpin the gun

Stop relax and remember even in the worst weather
You'll find a way across it, there'll be brighter days honest
So get up, get out and get somethin that's on the real
Forget what you were taught and show these people how you feel
Like
Who are you to tell me how to live my life
Cause I won't give this up
These are my shoes
My view
My cue
To say I do give a fuck

And pretty soon I'm a bloom and it'll be alright
Everyday's another chance to ignite
Cause I'm addicted (Uh-Oh), I'm addicted (Uh-Oh)
I'm addicted to this universal feelin called life

Since a foetus, explored life's subtle secrets
From my fingertips to my unique double helix
I can see history, I can see the past lessons
It's your right never be afraid to ask questions
How can every religion, claim to be the only one
How can they preach love - yet fight each other holding guns
I think the golden sun might be able to shed some light
I'd rather push peace and knowledge to defend our rights

These leaders in suits tell us to fight for one side
You think they got their sons and daughters on the frontline?
Not down for war but down to get an education
We're all equal yet they push synthetic separation
But in this matrix I won't be failin to make it
This is my cosmos baby space sailin with Sagan
I heard it's not where your from it's where your carvin' your view
I heard you don't have to wear a suit to argue the truth
And so

Who are you to tell me how to live my life
Cause I won't give this up
These are my shoes
My view
My cue
To say I do give a fuck

And pretty soon I'm a bloom and it'll be alright
Everyday's another chance to ignite
Cause I'm addicted (Uh-Oh), I'm addicted (Uh-Oh)
I'm addicted to this universal feelin called life

[Izm Interlude]

They spoon feed but I won't be taken that sedative
Cause my thoughts are way to precious to waste on the negative
I keep them critical yet positive to break the chains
Every dawn is a new chance to make a change
Think about all the energy swirlin all around us
We project it, we get affected this is profound stuff
Earth is my garden and I grew from it
I pay the youth homage cause I know their views honest

Can you read between the lines of the news comments
Fightin' over land just to take some fuel from it
I guess oil boils down to some cool profits
But war, what is it good for really who wants it?
Like

Who are you to tell me how to live my life
Cause I won't give this up
These are my shoes
My view
My cue
To say I do give a fuck

And pretty soon I'm a bloom and it'll be alright
Everyday's another chance to ignite
Cause I'm addicted (Uh-Oh), I'm addicted (Uh-Oh)
I'm addicted to this universal feelin called life</pre>
