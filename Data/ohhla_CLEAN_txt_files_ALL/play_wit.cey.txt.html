Shedrac, Meshak, Abendego
cast into the fire but they never burnt though
why's that? Its gotta be the spiritual
divine relations created miracles
be a vehicle of god I trod like Fard
take it back a yard where this hiphop starts
doin my part like Moshe with the Red Sea
drowning Hyskos burn an israeli the frailty of friction
will shatter misconceptions facts is missing
from history lessons and the victory weapon of the devil is hate
colonized land still occupy your mindstate
finding ways to tempt you to that lake of fire
aware of intentions and karmic desire
first I search then research pray till my knees hurt 
this aint for you thinks it's play you get burnt

CHORUS-
IF YOU PLAY WITH FIRE IT WILL BURN YOU
AND IF YOU PLAY WITH WATER IT WILL DROWN YOU

Life is getting more critical and crucial 
too much gunshots bloodshed and funerals
numerous tragedies wars and catastrophes
used to be overseas now its down the street
they never dreamed that U.S.A would have to pay
for the sins of the founding fathers until that day
judgment came this way in a graphic display
government agencies to panicked to save
its own citizens calling em refugees
who built this place descendants of New Orleans
voodan queens put a hex on slavemasters 
revelation chapter explains disaster

IF YOU PLAY WITH FIRE IT WILL BURN YOU
AND IF YOU PLAY WITH WATER IT WILL DROWN YOU

watch your words because the kids are listening
influence grows little girls are stripping
infants pimping television supervision
show em images tell lies and hide their wisdom
devise systems of schools and prisons
attempts to limit a potential born infinite
but skies the limit the youth have to be free
provide proper guidance give em books to read
encourage activity and real foods to eat
righteous edicate how and who to greet
you threw a seed but forgot to love and cultivate
it grew into a weed that breeds nothing but hate

IF YOU PLAY WITH FIRE IT WILL BURN YOU
AND IF YOU PLAY WITH WATER IT WILL DROWN YOU

I burn out benedict and big up Menelik
alotta wars goin on but who benefits
for Rome they got a new pope on the throne
used to be a hitler youth but you dont see whats wrong
with ariel sharon, blair, or george bush
they pawns for shatan now take a closer look
birthplace of the euro is the vatican why
headstate of deception to deny christ ressurection
live in the spirit and flesh and my thoughts manifest a worldy 
conception of demons dressed in white who testify
to have passion for life but are scared of ini
the different kind who carry Jah inner light
dreadlock Rasta winning the bigger fight

IF YOU PLAY WITH FIRE IT WILL BURN YOU
AND IF YOU PLAY WITH WATER IT WILL DROWN YOU</pre>
