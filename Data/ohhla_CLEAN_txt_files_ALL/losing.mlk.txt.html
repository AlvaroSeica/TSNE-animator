For a minute
Whatever you think I think about what's been going on
Let's talk about [x2]
You and your problems and all that it seems to do 
When you spend the night
Just talkin' bout [x2]
You and your problems no matter what I say, I can't get it right
Don't think about

[Chorus]
Losing out
Other words is losing out
Other ones, losing out
Other words is losing out
Other ones, losing out
Other words is losing out

[Verse One: Black Milk]
Yeah, let's talk about who's the most underestimated plus Underrated city in this hip hop game
Let's talk about I don't know if these industry mofo's overlook us Cause they might be afraid
They don't know if we get the spot like that
You might not get your spotlight back 
For a couple dec-ades
Let's talk about Auburn 
A burn 
Now it's Dave Twaz turn 
Like Berry Gordy came back
Don't think about comparing us to another Metropolitan area 
Or anywhere on this globe
Let's talk about us breaking barriers spittin' sick as malaria 
Spittin, you not even spittin' a cold
Let's talk about how they make the masses attracted to the wack Like a magnet, it's a sad mission
Just talkin' bout how I mastered these massive lyrics of ass 
Like you in a class with a mathematician
Just think about losing out

[Chorus: Black Milk speaking over the chorus]
Naw, you're not losing yet. We beat up beats like this all the time
You got a few minutes of abuse. My nigga Royce where you at? 

[Verse Two: Royce Da 5'9"]
Right here my nigga
Yes, let's talk about 
I got more cases than a maw' fucking A-R clip 
Than they got on our mayor
Let's talk about 
If you from the "D" and you don't fuck with Hex
Trick or me then you prolly a square
Let's talk about the Metropolitan area
Venereal spitter, still Proof burial bitter
Poof
Talk about me, I'ma be on yo ass 
Trouble sells, I will take I to the double L
Not think about tusslin' wit' a head buster
Who got mo' muscle than Cool J, double L, hah
You can pop like that
Take off your whole top like BAP 
Another body what the hell
Let's talk about makin nigga's hard earned money 
Or us puttin money on heads like I'm payin' their barbers
Talkin' bout cotton mouth
Hangover, Range Rover 
750 when I hit the streets game over
Nigga I ain't never losing out

[Chorus]

[Black Milk speaking over the chorus] 
Naw, nope. It's almost over
I give you one last chance to keep up
Round three nigga'. Uh

[Verse Three: Black Milk]
Let's talk about the best, the worst
Started from birth 
With the gift and the curse 
Nah I'm just spittin' the verse
Just to talk about whenever I'm spittin' the verse 
Feels like my words is splittin' the Earth in two
Got 'em talkin' 'bout, "Who's
That rap dude that master soul clap move 
When messin' with the boom bap BOOM
Like the "D"
When the crack moves in the street
Niggas pull heat longer than Shaq's shoes
Don't think about

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Bringin' out them ninas
Cause we bout to clean 'em out
Phone calls could lead to a red shirt
Ringin' out 
Gun shots Tec's blllert
Expert, leanin' out 
The window bringin' my inner demon out
Talkin' bout how we got it mastered
The fact that
Whenever me and Black, do a track, it's a classic
Talkin' 'bout my life nigga 
No sound realer rider with the four pound 
Thriller like Mike, out

[Chorus]</pre>
