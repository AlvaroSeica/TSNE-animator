[Chester Bennington]
You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine
You woke the devil that I thought you'd left behind
I saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

[Chorus]
And you, held it all
But you were careless, to let it fall
You, held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

[Chester Bennington]
I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end
I'm left with emptiness that words can not defend
You'll never know what I became because of you
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro: repeat 3X]
