Yo *echoes*
Older cats *echoes*
Yo *echoes*
Whassup Rae? What's going on Son?
  Whattup dude?
  Yeah, I ain't see y'all cats in a long time
Check it, yo
  Y'all better be on that shit too
Older cats max with young godz who got the guns
  KnowhatI'msayin son?
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run
  Y'all the little y'all the youth coming up
Or get stung by the killer bee stinga from the slums
  KnowhatI'msayin son?
  Yo son
Of the young Shaolin Monks, chickenheads will get done
  You the first man, you go first son

Verse One: Shyheim

I'm mobb deep, in cherry Cherokees I forever be
on some thug shit, runnin wild through New York City
Bustin guns rockin jew-els that shine like sun
Stapleton is where I'm from
And been down for years stayed on point like stairs (yeah, word up)
Cuz the jealous motherfuckers want to end my career
I never feared, the ghetto is hell, but I learned ta
Keep my mouth shut and pack a nickel-plated burner
And squeeze, if I get front on my nine millimi
will have my enemies, behind trees
Niggaz that think they live cuz they puff a little lye
Pack a bullshit, twenty-five, nah don't think they'll kill us

Chorus: RZA, with Rae

Older cats mack, roll with young godz that got the guns
  You right about that kid
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run
  Now yo y'all just keep everything moving you know
Or get stung by the killer bee stinga from the slums
  The beat is sounding like Star Trek
Of the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads, with the tongue
   So yo, youknowhatI'msayin Son?

Verse Two: Madman

Yo, deep in the ocean of the Atlantic, here comes the killa falcon
I meditate then swing with the force of mountains
Brain cells is able to be bi-debatable
When I think it's hazardous to your ozone layer
A pre-meditated killer plan so kill the Mayor, my silencer
causes niggaz to hush, then I rush, like Manchus
who guard jewels and collect, Cash Rules with heavy jewels
I live by name and cut veins
Burning bodies into flames
Between my anger, I lock down every chamber
Hillside strangeler, a nigga with a mask like Lone Ranger
Rap poetic is injected into the brain athletic
Build off of rhymin calisthetics
I'm determined, I raise a army like Hitler done Germans
and become the Allied commander, my enemies is catching on camera
They seek death, I begin to torture them (calm down kid take your time)
By giving butterfly stitches, bear witness
as I hang with Jehovah's Witnesses

Chorus: RZA

Older cats max with young godz that got the guns
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run
Or get stung, by the killa bee stinga from the slums
From the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads with the tongue

Verse Three: Rubbabandz

Yo, yo, this is manslaughter, so what you wanna do
Last year, you ran for the border with your crew
I flip, stacks, all the, time when I rhyme
Libra is my sign, and can't stand swine
When I dine, the automatic weapon
Got niggaz steppin, in the opposite direction
My jurisdiction, is off grounds to you clowns
My proposition, meaning you go round for round
Straight up and down, I broke the sound barrier
Scarier, than a tight skirt wrapped around a transvestite
The grammar, hype, nigga check your stacks
Or you'll be rhyming with a broke back
Niggaz talk about they rollin deep up in here
The only way you roll is if you in a wheelchair

Chorus: Raekwon, RZA

  Older...
Yo, y'all calm down man calm down calm down
  Yeah, and yo
Now yo, youknowhatI'msayin?
  I wanna tell y'all
Y'all up under the restrictions of the Wu camp
  Aiyyo Rae, you got Killa Sin
YouknowhatI'msayin?
  Madman, Shyheim the Rugged Child
So just take your time and handle life as it comes
  Motherfuckin Rubbabandz, the young godz comin through
Cause the real nigga gonna know what they gotta do
  Showin and provin youknowhatI'msayin?  Shaolin forever

Verse Four: Killa Sin

Yo, may all the bullshit cease, increase the war fuck the peace
Make shit hot like rockin tube socks at Jones Beach
in the summer, number one gunner run for cover
Keep em steppin with more Lethal Weapons than Danny Gloves
I cock back, action packed raps and gats
niggaz trade mats for prats people react, to RZA sharp tracks
Another day nother body dropped you better keep your shottie cocked
for actin snotty Hobbes catch karate chops
Cuz Wu-Tang live, forever and a day
you better pray for better ways to get away when my Beretta spray
We never play with commercialism
The hardcore rhythm give em more hell than an exorcism
My terrordome be a clever poem let it be known
I'm packin chrome and rollin phatter than eleven bones
My crew's sicker than that AIDS shit
While others get played quick, cause we be making hits through the grave sift
My right hand man, myself and the Clan
Gun and mic stands reverses help me see my first a hundred grand
And to my Physical one love power crazy real
for all them carbon copy niggaz lurkin in the rap deal

Chorus: RZA

Older cats max, the young godz yo they got the guns
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run
Or get stung by the killa bee stinga from the slum
Come the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads with the tongue

Older cats max, young godz got the guns
Out of town niggaz best to run
Yo, older cats mack, the young godz, check it out
Yo, older cats mack, the young godz, they got the guns
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run
Or get stung by the killa bee stinga from the slum
From the young Shaolin Monks, takin heads with the tongue
From the slum comes the young Shaolin Monks, takin heads with the tongue
Older cats mack, but young godz got the guns
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run
Or get stung
Killa bee stinga from the slum, come the young
Shaolin Monks taking heads with the tongue
Older cats max, but young godz they got the guns
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run
Aiyyo stop it
Older cats max but young godz they got the guns
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run
Or get stung by the killa bee stinga from the slum
From the young Shaolin Monks taking heads with the tongue
Young Shaolin Monks taking heads with the tongue
Older cats max but young godz got the guns
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run
Or get stung...
