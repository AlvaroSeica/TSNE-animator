[Timbaland]
Lemme see them big titties, don't be actin' sadidy you're not pretty
Break bread if you wanna get with me, all I wanna do is dig up in them kidneys
Tell your boyfriend he better mind his business for he end up in the trunk of my Bentley
I'm considered a boss you can't get me, you ain't got enough paper to deal with me
Babygirl wanna two step wit me turn around wit her ass up against me
Roll along and got tipsy then tonight, tommorow you the mystery
All you haters on that hoe shit miss me, I stay strapped security don't frisk me
Fed it off til the motherfucker empty, I'll turn around and do the same shit next week
come on

(Timbaland)[Timberlake]
(Bounce)[like your ass had the hiccups]
(Bounce)[like we was ridin' in my pickup]
(Bounce)[why you lookin' so sad babygirl you need to cheer up]
(Bounce)[I got the remedy, it's you on me and me on you]
[It's you on me and me on you and you on her]
[And her on me, and her on you, and y'all on me]
[And me on y'all and y'all on me menage a trois, menage a twa ahh uhh]

[Dr. Dre]
There she go, just what the doc's been lookin for
She just what I need, lookin Chinese like ~Sum Yung Ho~
I gotta bungalo we can disappear for a week or so
Yeah, I gotta stadium flow Superbowl with it like I'm Dungy yo
Oh, yes, congratulations you run a millionaire invitation
Sorry I'm so demanding, sick of dancing back to mansion and
And this money handsome, ain't that a panty anthem
I kill me just like you from the back you'll see

[Missy Elliott]
Hold up, hell naw like Britney Spears I wear no drawls
In the club I drink it up, goomp goomp drink it up
Got Patron sippin' in my cup, hey, where's your man
Bet that I could make him love me oooh
When he see the jugs he will wanna rush to get a quick touch
Of this big ole butt, mmmhmmm big ole butt
Thick legs, big ole jugs legs stick like rims on the truck
Take em to the crib, yeah we gon fuck
You could call me a freak, I like to get BUCK, BUCK
And I don't have to do much to make him get it up
Sum Yung Hoe she worth two dollars
I'm worth more dollars than make up beauty parlors
I pop collars ca ca ca ca collars
I on't buy shots, I only buy the bottles
Only rich girls we only buy the bottles
But like a porn star I'm best when to swallow
