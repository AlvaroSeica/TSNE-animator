(*talking*)
See if I gotta lie to kick it
I'd just rather not kick it man
Take me for who I am, in the words of Dolemite
If you don't, confidentially I don't give a damn
See, everybody think they gotta try to portray a image
But this how it really go

[K-Rino]
Watch your boy here I come, rolling down the avenue
Not in a Bentley or a Phantom, just a Malibu
Sorry if you met me, and you thought I'd have a slab or two
I'm living in the hood, I got one crib and that'll do
Grinding everyday, but I ain't sitting on seven figgas
I'm not a gangsta murderer, who shot up twenty niggaz
I don't lie about my lifestyle, I do me and I get love
And I never made it rain, twenty G's inside a strip club
No diamonds on my fingers or my neck, cause I don't sport em
One because it ain't my style, and two I can't afford em
If you can do your thang boy, go hard up in the paint
I don't knock you if that's you, but I do knock you if it ain't
Yeah I'm still making records, traveling knocking these shows off
And backstage, ain't no groupies there ripping my clothes off
I'm not a powder head, bragging bout sniffing my nose off
And I wasn't sipping drank, I was just sleepy so I dozed off

[Chorus]
I'm not balling out of control,  I never made it rain
My twitter's not blowing up, I'm still on the chain
I just laugh, when these rappers be lying bout what they got
Cause everything these suckers claim they are, I promise you they not

[K-Rino]
The spots that I be going to, ain't got no red carpet
My car's right next to yours, the valet didn't park it
My wardrobe is simple, no one cares how much it costed
This shirt was 9.99, at King's Flea Market
I'm not in V.I.P., I'm in the main club with ya
And when I left, no paparazzi was taking pictures
I'm not a mob boss, or king pin moving weight
And I ain't never ran a car load, of bricks across the state
I just walked in pulled out a wad of money, and it was on
(what you do), paid my cable lights and phone and went back home
Yeah I might fly to a show, hit the stage and rock the livest set
But coach seats, no first class no private jet
No worldwide street team, like some of these liars
I paid a crackhead ten dollars, to pass out my fliers
My single ain't on fire, I barely got a buzz
No millions in the bank, but on that note I wish it was

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
Ain't no lake behind my house, where we swim and go fishing
I don't live in a mansion, with four or five kitchens
The women don't scream, when they see me like Justin Bieber
And I never dated a star, or supermodel either
I don't do drive by's, and I'm not sewing the game up
I never made a sex tape, to try to blow my name up
The flash and the industry hype, I'm not pursuing that
And wrecking all them rappers...hold up wait, I do re' doing that
Why you bragging on the image, that you never could prove
I ain't fronting like these fools, I'm just a regular dude
Ain't no entourage around me, fronting and acting hard
When I show up at the do', it's just me and the good Lord
No million dollar video shoots, no glitz no glamour
My partna did it free, with a handheld HD camera
And I never won a Grammy, and my album went wood
But I got a ghetto plaque, for showing love to every hood

[Chorus]

(*talking*)
I can't believe ya'll be believing these dudes man
I done seen these cats rap about Maybachs
And roll up in a Toyota Corolla
Fool your favorite rapper work at Taco Cabana somewhere man
Keep it real, just be who you are man get it the right way</pre>
