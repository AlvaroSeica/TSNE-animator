I'm white and I'm from Pennsylvania
I don't have no gold and I don't have a pager
Where I'm from there wasn't no scene
I got my information from Highlights Magazine

I drove a jeep that my parents bought me
Drove it over 60 but the cops never caught me
Wore clothes from the Gap watched the Dukes and Daisy
And when I got nasty shoplifted at Macy's

Sneakin boys up to my room
Hoppin skippin jumpin like those kids in zoom
But I brought home the 4.0 for my daddy Sam
And I used my fake ID to buy beer from the Busch Can</pre>
