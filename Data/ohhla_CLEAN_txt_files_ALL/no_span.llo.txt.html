[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Hey man, you know what I'm talking about?
Jamaica Dave, I see ya boy, holla at you peoples, I'm saying
What's good nigga? You know I got that liquor for you

[Lounge Lo]
Yo, I'm a match made in the city, a thug on the brizzy
Switch lanes, pump hard, pitch 'caine in Poughkeepsie
It's where them niggas throw them gang signs up, fuck if you with me
It's me, BZ Mode, claim set, 160
Now bitch know what I'm saying, now niggas is bitching
And I lived my 'life simple', just like Nicole Ritchie
I'm here, I'm going nowhere, it's hair on my face
And I can care shit how many scared in the place
My name, ring the bells, I fucks with Flood
Ya'll cats is clean, boy, ya'll don't do no mud
So what, you got a gun, you don't bust no slugs
And the one nigga I'm around, yeah, I trust it love
Now why you wanna test I? Yes my Lord
Lord Yes'll come through, with the mack and the four
And start the clap at the back of the door, you know the repertoire
U Double S R, you know the regular street cred is set, pa
And word to mami, you can see it from the tech start

[Chorus: Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, the shit that we do, man, we out to do damage
And muthafucka we don't speak no *Spanish*
Got, guns and drugs, we don't fuck with cameras
And muthafucka we don't speak no *Spanish*

[Flood]
Yo, I don't give a fuck, what you say about us
How you feel about us, or what the fuck you think about us
Cuz we gon' do us, that's my word, straight up
You keep talking that slick, now your ass gon' get cut
You a carve ass nigga, slob ass nigga
Word to God, you ass, yo Lounge, hold my liquor
You wanna talk about swagger? I'mma show you how to do it
Wanna talk about a rock? I'll show you how to move it
Wanna go and run your mouth? You front, I'll show you how to lose 'em
Matter fact, oh you don't know who you fucking with, so what if you don't
I got a nine to make sure that you won't
I'm Flood, bitch, I'm going in, as if Jordan took the last shot
He's in the game, know your ass popped
You got a hole in ya, so, nigga hold that
While you laying on the floor like a doormat
I tuck my shit in, give me my drink back
Good looking Lounge, I guess we showed them, huh?
We leave 'em stinking like a fucking bomb, bomb

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
