[Pusha T]
This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders, gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided if it hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, and my side bitch I let tag along
Call me daddy from a complex cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard, step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on callin' cards and I'm speakin' spanish like Don Omar
But I'm King Push, this King Push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks

Fuck nigga, with the sly talk, miss me, with all the pie talk
When them lights on you, and them letters big, you point us out, just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For eleven years, we seen better years; we was sellin' birds over the time port
My first grammy was my first brick, red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than Billboard; I got a label deal under my mattress
Cause I'm King Push, still King Push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ahh

Vultures to my culture exploit the struggle, insult ya
They name droppin' 'bout caine coppin' but never been a foot soldier
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry roadster, inside track on the G-Rap poster
Best D-boy all I'm missin' is a +Dash+, difference between me and +Hova+
But I'm King Push, still King Push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ahh</pre>
