Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
What is this in the distance?
A drug begging for commitment
Man I'm gonna do what they say
Releasing this retrogress with Mayday!

"uh oh, Uh Oh, UGH OH OH oh oh"

[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
I'm thinking of retrogression, about going back to my best friend
On an X binge, with the uncut molly would you kill me is the question
I miss sessions, what about two chicks on deck in my bed undressin
Now we meshin, pressin sex n sweatin left in a press of heaven
I use ta... boost her
with Adderall...
my teeth would chatter all naw well really don't matter yall
I'm cool
Like the cigarettes, I was a bigger threat to the clitoris
Successful sexually bitter neck getter wet
Just how high can a nigga get?
Blasted, Acid, F Astrisks
See coulda he say he may crashed it
Fit to replay, D-day ashes
I'd take masses, so I could stay plastered
That great plastic, I ate like mate in lake placid

"Molly I miss you, if I was to kiss you
would you take this sick fool to old-days
I know you can lift moods, when I'm havin issues
I wish I could split smooth to the old-days"

[Hook]
If..you..feel
Like their plan don't fit us all..
Then..you..will
Find my land don't give us law
If..you..feel like not taking that bigger fall
then with all respect, if we retrogress
then they'll rid us all!

[Verse 2 - Wrekonize (Mayday!)]
Okay so lets go, retro
Gression I'm guessin that wreck knows
These memories are all in my flesh though
Strange love, hes entered the flesh mode
Some of the greatest sex swolls are XO
And if I was bringing the vicks tips to her lips
It was for something she would never let go
I'd drink shots with her laugh and smoke newports
The time we spent was too short
My mind is heading do north
My body's on its true coarse
This women has got my youth sore and tooth raw
"All of the lights are leading me through a new door"
Can we just go back?
Can we just reunite?
I need a throwback, to seeing you in flight
You had that down south body with a hint of death
Picked you up and held you down sound
Until I went to rest
But who needs rest, when the world is go
Everything is burnin so
Imma just alert the globe
And hurt you slow, you know for fast lovin vertigo
So I just pick you up get a little intimate
In a minute and wait for the turn of a virgins flow

[Hook]
If..you..feel
Like their plan don't fit us all..
Then..you..will
Find my land don't give us law
If..you..feel like not taking that bigger fall
then with all respect, if we retrogress
then they'll rid us all!

[Verse 3 - Dernz (Mayday!)]
I tuned em out.. I, I tuned em out
Too busy turnin on and droppin out behind my
My mommas house, producing clouds
Never understood my need to get numb me
While I'm bleedin out my eyes, even out my lungs
Tryin to avoid the sun
Curious at a young age for a taste
Watchin them numb they face
Took Caroline found someone for us to bring out on dates
I call it youthful curiosity
Jump the edge every Saturday
Strobe lights an low lives the city at night was callin me
I turned em out.. I, I turned em out
Had em both kissin on my lips n smoke the spliff to boost the trip
Lift off, I'm gone
Phone call to my bro lettem know that I'm lost
And I got sand in my shoes from twilight beach MÃ©nage Ã  trois
Heavy sedated eyes, grew up with jaded eyes
See she's been friends of mine since 99
But now we don't see eye to eye
I cant retrogress, unless life gets to heavy for my chest
Then I'll be tuning out again and droppin out before they win</pre>
