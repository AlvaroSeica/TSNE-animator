The way some cats yeah get that cash
Fuck around have a gun in your face
Tied up and their whippin your ass

Man most cats man they don't play cause their moms get high
I can still recall the day I saw a gangsta cry

Man under the hot sun
Young cats they buck with hot guns fat ones
Man if you sellin this
You better know the consequence shit
Walk just like ????
Yeah man let me borrow that
Please homeboy don't be no snitch
You put this business before that fine bitch
Here go a classic tale
A motherfucker just got outta jail
Slipped up on some major mail
Then went back to jail on major bail yo

Yo most cats man they don't play cause their moms get high
I can still recall the day I saw a gangsta cry

Don't be no perpetrator
Fuck around and be on a respirator
Going up to heaven on an escalator
Cause they sent you to hell on an elevator yo

You're right in front of the corner store with the 4-5 slug</pre>
