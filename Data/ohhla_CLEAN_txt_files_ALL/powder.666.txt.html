Powder get you hyper, get you hyper
Get you hype, get you, get you, get you hyper
(5x)

Verse 1: Lil' E

This shit is for you niggas that really need to hear the fuckin' truth
Bout why you saw Lil E take a chew and chew ah some ah that flaky fruit
Lay down I hope you brace yourself before we take this bumpy ride
Cause you about to see the Lil E while he's on that wild side
I'm not playin' no game like some of these other niggas like to do
You lookin' a bit serious while I'm snortin' some ah that god damn toot
Just like I said before don't test my pimpin' while I'm on that white
Weed ain't nuthin' but something to slow my roll
But powder get's me hype
Now that powder got some size with it that'll make you feel superb
Like Montana did when he went down to snort up out that bird
Some of y'all niggas out there snort a pack or two and think it's great
You ain't gettin' p'd unless it's nothing that you wanted to ate
Balls stacked tall, and don't stall is what I'm all about
When I'm goin' to coke, don't play I'm gettin' p'd out
Ain't no fuckin' around when it come to the dope,
Cocaine got me addicted nigga hurry up and pass the dope

Hook:

Powder get you hyper,
Snort, snortin' cocaine got me addicted nigga pass the blow
Powder, powder get you hyper
Snort, snortin' cocaine got me addicted nigga pass the blow
Powder, powder get you hyper
Snort, snortin' cocaine got me addicted nigga pass the blow
Powder, powder get you hyper
Snort, snortin' cocaine got me addicted nigga pass the blow

Verse 2: Lil' E

Causin' nothing but mayhem when I'm hostile, bout into somethin' man
Specially when I'm full ah some ah that grass and some ah that cocaine
Now don't let me have a few ah them pills on poppin' down my throat
Man it feels so good when mixin' it wid some ah that goddamn coke
Definitely how this big boy like to do it when I like to get,
Full ah that fuckin' fuckin' ink and syrup yeh that's the shit
Takin' that god damn fight strap wid that bright is how I'll always be
Blowin' on nothin' less and some of the best of that old potent leaf
I can't think of no other way to do it except the playa way
Constantly buyin' some tissue cause yo nose be blunted from that bay
Sneezin', coughin', drainin' all that comes wid blowin' that fast hoe
Have a blow I widdle it in I bet you wanna quit ya don't
Goin' like the Energizer bunny 24-7 man
I'm one ah them big ballers steadily breakin' out them pitcher packs
I done said it once so listen good about the god damn white
When you take that blow you'll find out that that powder get's you hype

Hook

Snort, snortin' cocaine got me addicted nigga pass the blow
