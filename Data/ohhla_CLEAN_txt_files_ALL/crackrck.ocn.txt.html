[Frank Ocean]
You don't know how little you matter
Until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas
With a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde
You used to hit it raw
Cause she was and you are madly involved
Madly involved

[Chorus]
Hittin stones, in glass homes
You're smokin stones, in abandoned homes
You hit them stones, and broke your home
Crack rock crack rock; crack rock crack rock

[repeat Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
You're shuckin and jivin, stealin and robbin
To get the fixin that you're itchin for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut-up-uh-uh-uhhp from time to time
But the freaks ain't tryin to sleep with cracky

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Crooked cop, dead cop - how much dope can you push to me?
Crooked cop, dead cop - no good for community
Fucking pig get shot - three hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped - and don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds - oooh sound
Don't no one hear the shells - oooh shells
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock, oooooh
Crack rock, oooooh
Crack rock~! How you feelin girl? Oooh
How's the gutter doin? Crack rock </pre>
