Song:   Thinking of You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Can I hit you later?
'Cause it's my jam
Rollin' in my beat up
Gold Trans Am

Sorry, I can't hear you
And I got plans
You won't get me naked
You had your chance

I know I said I wouldn't
Talk about you publicly but
That was before I caught you
Lyin' and cheating on me, slut!

I was down for you hardcore
While you were out trying to score
Found out you're full of it
I'm over it, so suck my dick

I heard our song on the radio
And I see your face everywhere I go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh

But now my song's on the radio
And you see my face everywhere you go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh

So I've got your message
Are you having fun
With your fugly girlfriend?
I've moved on

Can I hit you later?
Gotta get to stage
In a brand new city
Gettin' laid

I know I said I wouldn't
Talk about you publicly but
That was before I caught you
Lyin' and cheating on me, slut!

I was down for you hardcore
While you were out trying to score
Found out you're full of it
I'm over it, so suck my dick

I heard our song on the radio
And I see your face everywhere I go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh

But now my song's on the radio
And you see my face everywhere you go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh

Oh! Heard our song on the radio
And I see your face everywhere I go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh

But now my song's on the radio
And you see my face everywhere you go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you
Thinking of you, ooh-ooh

(Ooh, teenie weenie)</pre>
