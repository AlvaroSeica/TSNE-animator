[Intro: Prodigal Sunn]
Yeah, uh huh (yeah, love all my family, man)
Grand Daddy Polly what up baby, what's up baby
(Thanks a lot for all that man) The grinds, the grinds
You know I love ya'll, uh, that's where I'm from
The grinds, where you from? The grinds
Where you from? The grinds, every day
On the grinds, gritties, ain't nothin'
The grinds, the gritty, ain't nothin'
The grinds, the gritty, ain't nothin' pretty
The grinds, the gritty, yo, yo

[Chorus 2X: Prodigal Sunn]
The grind, gritty, ain't nothin' pretty
Money on the wood, we came to get busy
Throw your hands in the air, if you're with me
North, East, West, South, I know you hear me

[Bridge: Prodigal Sunn]
Yeah, uh-huh, I know you feel me
Yeah, uh-huh, I know you hear me
Yeah, the grinds, I know you feel me
The grinds, uh-huh, the grinds

[Prodigal Sunn]
Stay stoned to the bone, swiss beat like Jane
Twist the black round with the green eyes, red on the scene
You know what I mean, artillery, mega machines
I love in livin' the American dream, dream
Tear out your spleen, please, don't try to stunt on my team
Front on my team, you get evaporated, sugar and cream
Page seven Source, magazine, and Sunz supreme
Face on the cam, now they wanna, know who I am
Know who I am, light up the jam, like Shazaam
Blood of the lamb, me and my fam, run you like rams
Easy in the jungle, we breath, longsleeve, dungarees
Thieves in the hood, wanna see me achieve
Posted toasted, New Year's eve, celebration
Peace, Sunzini, the grinds, on your station
Sunz of Man, Two On Da Road, build dedication
Wu-Tang Clan, affiliation

[Chorus]

[Hook: samples cut up]
"Jewels out, layin' on three hundred dollar sweaters" - Hell Razah  "Cold"
  "Dealers get the dope - 12 O'Clock
"They ain't no time, time, time, to really chill" - Guru "Tons O Guns"
  "Yo, the Son don't chill" - Raekwon "Knowledge God"

[Prodigal Sunn]
Criminal gun play, chemicals rain in P.J.'s
Last raid, another fed paid, red rum: Sunday
The world dyin' for the love of money, expensive chains
Intensive pain from that cocaine, condition the brain
Tricked in the strain, as I look back, memory lane
Simple and plain, it be in fame, a major part of the game
Chemistry grain, foolish kids ran, when I came
Forty acres, five percent of terrain, spark life
Through my vein tunnel, aim through the jungle of rain
A lot of haters wanna see us hang, watch me bang
As in Eagle/Crane, snap crack, shatter your frame
Another victim in the system, where he barely sustained
Fortunate, I sold a million records first campaign
Sippin' rosemary cherry champagne, pain
The young and the dangerous, water on the wrist, ice cryst'
Talk with a lisp, V.I.P., top of your list

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Prodigal Sunn]
Last seen and heard, pushin' the H2, bangin' that Donald Bird
Thugs honor my word, drama makes my passion emerge
Rashin' off the heads of green herbs, I know ya'll heard
We blast word, keepers out of pieces by the thirds
It's the attack of the Sunzini, black genie
Chains glee me, through rash back like Mussolini
Who wanna see me? Up in the party, I stay garley
Stainless steel or black chrome Harley, the young Bob Marley
Son, you gets 'no respect' like Rodney
And you standin' on 'Dangerfield', about a half a mil'
Plus I move with a staff that kill
Rope chain beats, we manifest, shank wit heat
Met the realest dogs, spilled wide name and held frame
If I had to blast, no short, up close range
Through my cold frame, never use my name in vein
Violation cause me to let off like John Wayne

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Outro: Prodigal Sunn]
Catch the fire in me, B.A. to Dirty South
B.T., T.A., V.A., New York City, B-Town, Chi-Town
St. Louis, the grinds</pre>
