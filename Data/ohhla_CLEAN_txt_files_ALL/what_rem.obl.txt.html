[Verse 1]
Mom, I know you think I'm too cold for love
Too old for hugs, who stole the rug?
From under our feet, you used to watch me on the street
Through the window in the kitchen where you cooking up a feast
How we rarely speak now sit and eat in hurt, silent
I wanna ask but life and when you stopped smilin'
But, I'm on the road again this weekend
You got a weary look like you just been weepin'
Is it stress?  Debts?  Work and no sleep?
Your once alert eyes now lined with crows feet
Shhhh....I just wish that you'd speak
Bout the life that you seek, 'bout the life that we had then
You raising two kids, who asking where dad went
You made a brave face and, packed up our bags then
Moved us to America, you still jet lagged
worked hard, no relaxing, they laughed at your accent!
Damn you soldiered through everything life's force brings
........but I wanted more things
cause Cory's got Diadoras, Rob's got gold rings
I'm rockin' kicks you copped from a grocery store bin
So I stole from your purse, don't know what hurt worse
The fact that I stole or you couldn't buy me new shirts
That's life you'd say, you made no excuses
So I stencil in your hurt, these words will see you through it

[Hook]
If it hurts or it aches, if it burns or it stings
Is it worth all the strain, all the tears that remain
Through the years when the pain comes to claim what remains
Cause it must be love.  You trusted love
If it hurts or it aches, if it burns or it stings
Is it worth all the strain, all the tears that remain
Through the years when the pain comes to claim what remains
Then it must be love.  You trusted love

[Verse 2]
Khalil, it's been a minute since we talked
I'm sittin at this bar in Michigan sippin' a scotch
Thinking 'bout our mothers and the men that they raised
How we stumbled into manhood, on a road that's unpaved
Some say with age comes wisdom.  I think not
Cause as I get older I just shake delusions off
This ain't booze talkin' homey, I hope you doing good
You took me under your wing like an older brother would
Damn, I should have been there when your whole world shook
Heard the cancer's eating her bones, I wondered 'bout your outlook
You shrugged it off, or so it seemed and remained normal
Stayed strong for your fam, your pain remained dormant
Mourned in your own way, you? You here lifeline
Patched your spirits back up.  Respect death's design
That's life I guess, you make no excuses
So I stencil in your hurt, these words will see you through it

[Hook]

[Bridge]
When the fan's and the shows and the girls go away
Take a look around, what remains is the day
Put it in a song just to give my life away
To you, for you, to you, for you
When the sun and the stars and the moon fades away
Take a look around, what remains is the day
Put it in a song just to give my life away
To you, for you, to you, for you

[Verse 3]
Why we hurt those we care about, just to protect them
In the name of love, unsaid words become weapons
You say I don't communicate, just stay mum and stare
I'm so selfish, I'd rather talk to drum kicks and snares
And you're tired.  Losing patience in this negative space
.........see what I'm saying
Silences, shoulder shrugs, we froze each other out
For weeks on end, had me sleeping on the couch
Till we both got sick, and you got up out the house
Babygirl, it's been August since you left
I ain't a changed man yet, I got no promises left
To all the women that I love, who love me back though I fail 'ya
Who understand a calm sea never makes a skilled sailor
That's life I guess, you make no excuses
So I stencil in your hurt these words will see you through it

[Hook]
