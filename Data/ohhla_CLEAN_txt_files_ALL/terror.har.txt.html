[Intro: Black Jesus]
Yo Biggie, turn me up

[Black Jesus]
My first memory, the age of four
I was shot by the police in the leg on 144th
In the cab, and my Dad was blasting back at the pigs
Told the driver he'd better lose 'em 'fore he popped off his wig
We got away, and it didn't even hurt
I didn't cry, when they pulled the bullet out, I just watched with a smirk
Now I see why my grandmama hated my father
Didn't understand, the man was addicted to drama
Fast forward, now I'm up in The Bronx
Abandoned building's my home, we 'bout to move up the block with my aunt
My little brothers, happy, getting to sleep in the bed
I was tired of sleeping on the floor, scared stiff, almost dead
It didn't last cuz that bitch, time was seener (fucking bitch)
Was s'posed to be our babysitter, robbed the store, the clothes or my sneakers
My daddy kicked in the door with the nina (come here, come here)
And dragged her to the crib, my mama screamed "Lord, give me the cleaver"
I'm a terror...

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Wil Power]
Yeah, we been terrors since birth, man
For the righteous cause, man
Black Jesus, Harlem 6, man
Y'all know what this is, we been carrying guns
Picking up counts for the causes, since age twelve, man
We clapping at you mothafuckas, man
All you bitches and you bitch-ass, made-ass niggaz, man
Step to this, man, let's do it, thug righteous, nigga!

[Black Jesus]
She held her down and said "Bitch, I'ma chop off yo' hand"
Daddy grabbed her and said "Nah, use the hammer instead"
She broke her hand like no hand ever broke before
I was laughing at her so hard 'til my stomach was sore
We let her get away, she burned our building down to the ground
Now I'm upstate, about six, up in some hick town
My first day of school, was the first time I cried
The only black kid, made a crown, navy on, didn't feel right
The boys used to mush me, the girls called me cutie
In first grade, Erica, showed the kid her pussy-pussy
About a year later, was the worst of the worst
This dirty white boy tried to fuck me in a burnt out old church (Faggot)
To try is to fail, I ran away, run Forrest!
My half-brothers came from the city and the faggot got tortured
I'm a terror...

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Wil Power]
You thought you was just gon' get away with that, nigga?
See me, nigga, you know where I'm at, man
This is mothafucking Harlem 6, we terrorize you mothafuckas' neighborhood, man
Mothafucka, we do this shit for mothafucking fun, man
We don't get paid to do this, man
We do this for the babies, man
Mothafucka, I dare you, nigga
I dare you to go against this, man, step up!

[Black Jesus]
When they was done, I put a brick to his head
Daddy told him that he's lucky we didn't fill his ass with lead
By age ten, my pops was locked up, I'm failing the fourth grade
Miss Solomon, she failed me on purpose for God's sakes
I'm twelve now, mama's got a new boyfriend
A Puerto Rican named Alfredo with a wicked ass hand
He kept the coke in the crack, and the dope in the freezer
Sniffed dope once, ten lines, thought I was skiied up
Robbed this man, Salis, got me for the guns and the diamond
Rank Mama told me to give it back, probation and thirteen
By sixteen, I'm back in Spanish Harlem, a problem
Ditching school, hanging with the bitches and robbing
Everything in sight, but the mic was my therapy
I terrorize, these spoiled rotten rappers, my enemies
I'm a terror...

[Chorus]

[Outro: Wil Power]
Get out of line, mothafucka
I'll mothafucking body you all over the pavement, nigga
For fun, nigga, for the righteous cause, nigga
Thug righteous music, Marley Marl, baby
We doing this real big, this is how we take it
We got mothafucking soldiers all over
We had ass before the cash, nigga
Step up, nigga, I'll hurt one of you mothafuckas, man</pre>
