Get ya ass chopped in two fuckin wit the FU
Bran ya and I swing just like Evander
Real deal and ruff so when ya feeling tuff
Come on kids come on kids brint it!
6 foot 4 with the strength of Sampson
Running over niggars like I'm Rodney Hampton
Say adios when I start to roast
Making most of the mic in my hand
Freak it spooky like a ghost cause

Sum dum monkey bumped his head on
Repeat 3x

Ooh watch out here comes the lyrical blabber

Or beats like the bloods and crips. Cause
