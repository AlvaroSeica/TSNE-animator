[Krayzie Bone]
Y'all know who it is
Bone Thugs-N-Harmonyyyyyy, Harmony, Harmony

[Chorus: Krayzie] + (Flesh)
They know I'm +Krayzie+ by the flow
Nigga never +Layzie+ 'bout my dough dough dough
I'm in the +Flesh+ on a quest for mo'
+Bizzy+ +Wishin+ they would just pay me the money I'm owed owed owed
(Ooh yeah, back is that mighty reala)
(Ooh yeah, doin it the way you never)
(Ooh yeah, ooh, ooh yeah, ohhh yeahhhh)

[Layzie Bone]
See all I know was get out and get it, I stay on the grind all night 'til my feet go numb
Blowin more weed than Cheech and Chong, livin by the motto "To each his own"
Godspeed it's on, Flesh free he home, did we go wrong or was it in the plan?
Designed by the Man Upstairs, this testimonial that say we can, we can
We can do it, gotta put your mind to it, plant your feet in the dirt just push right through it
When shit get rough, you gotta stick to it, just play that Bone Thug music
It's that feel-good music, chill or act a fool wit it
Real thug niggaz with real life drama it's just like watchin a movie
The soundtrack of my life, right how they bounce back more than twice, aight
I admit we done did some crazy shit, but I stop, repent, kept God in my sights
Recognize it was a fight, either you're wrong or you're right, let this song be the light
Eternal them Bone Thugs soldiers, I'm Mighty Mo Thuggin for life

[Chorus]

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Ooh yeah, they back finna hit y'all with that mighty real good
Ooh (ooh) no doubt about it you bound to feel it good
We still hood even though we came up, changed the whole game up
Now them actin how much they angry, steady sayin we ain't the same
Pointin the blame at us, the only thing is I'ma go get it even if I gotta split yo' wig
They can't get enough of my style cause I got the job well done winnin it (winnin it)
Big ups to all of my hustlers, while the globe's spinnin ain't time to sleep
Break me off a piece of that paradise pie, 'til the day I die I'ma represent my peeps
Hit up fool from all, and then somebody speak they peace
Nothin but heat for the street now turn up that Bone beat (beat)
They tried to hold me but couldn't keep me down
Cause Flesh, got a whole world of my Trues to be found!

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
You owe me money man, if not I gotta get my respect
It's too many years of grindin, baby mama want my royalty checks
It ain't about Twista, but nobody flippin they tongue like Ripsta
No nigga can cause my earthquake, like marchin in my dead weight
Little Capo got hurt, wait, my niggaz is hurtin daily
Good thing Wally see me and Krayzie, they woulda just left him ailin
And then there was shots in the melee, it was never to protect myself
Little Layzie got it baby, and I pop popped everyone else
Tanks rolled over the temple, me Palestinians ain't never left
When I seen the face of Zeke, bothers me, pep in yo' step
You never could feel my breaths (remember) remember that Biz' with Bone
Off to another dimension, you owe me but I'm on my own, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Krayzie Bone]
Yeah, still chasin that paper dawg and I won't slow down 'til I made it all
They better give me what's mine, I'ma get it and go grind and get up in it one mo' time
Better ask about my rep, better check yo'self, self, self
They must've thought I was somebody else, body else, yeah
Everybody bit off just a little bit of Bone Thugs, bet they'll never own up
We originated that there sho' 'nuff, better run and go get they flow up
Came from Cleveland, Ohio, the realest that I know they never saw nothin like Bone
True innovators the greatest and even the haters is sayin that we make 'em zone
We make 'em sang (sang) no matter what they say everybody all know Bone Thugs
We changed the game (game, game) we made 'em sing like me
Against the grain (grain, grain) but they don't wanna respect me and where I come from
I tell 'em they can run on up, come on over here and get you some, get you some some
