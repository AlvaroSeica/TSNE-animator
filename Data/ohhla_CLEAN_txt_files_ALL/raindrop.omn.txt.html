[raindrops hook]
that's just the way it goes
it's out of my control
you really never know now, here we go
raindrops keep on falling on me...
the people keep on calling on me..

that's just the way it goes
it's out of my control
you really never know now, here we go
raindrops keep on falling on me...
the people keep on calling on me..

raindrops keep on falling on me...
the people keep on calling on me..
raindrops keep on falling on me...
the people keep on calling on me..

[omni verse]
I hear it in my sleep I can't escape the beat haunts me
the crowd watches me close I move cautious
situations take place you can't erase mistakes
keep a straight face, hanging off the ledge watching waves break
fear is unacceptable it's not professional I let it go
I know better now to let it roll
your life cost money but the money cost your life
you can sacrifice yourself for the ice what's your price?
pick a number and watch the mighty dollar keep us under
while we try to save our kids from hunger
what becomes us stress builds anger oppressed for years
we live like animals so I guess the way we act is understandable
I pray to god sincerely may angels walk with me
speak your words through me I'm yours truly
nothing lasts forever some things will never change
still it's all the same, just call my name

[raindrops hook]
that's just the way it goes
it's out of my control
you really never know now, here we go
raindrops keep on falling on me...
the people keep on calling on me..

that's just the way it goes
it's out of my control
you really never know now, here we go
raindrops keep on falling on me...
the people keep on calling on me..

raindrops keep on falling on me...
the people keep on calling on me..
raindrops keep on falling on me...
the people keep on calling on me..

[omni verse]
it's the all knowing all seeing supreme being
part human part mutant part genius
the boy wonder speak truth and throw thunder
from down navigate the cold summer
the art of reason rearrange the odds
even ghetto kids dream of black jesus
a black president when hell freezes
crime seasons 10 planets 5 seasons obey treason
laws are passed for the masses fuck the fascists
they think backwards I look past them and work faster
the third chapter was written before I started spitting
before I started really living the gift was given
you can see god in the children's eyes
still surprised by life but too young to realize
the price or the color of his skin
or the evils of men where do I begin
what a world to bring them in yeah

[raindrops hook]
that's just the way it goes
it's out of my control
you really never know now, here we go
raindrops keep on falling on me...
the people keep on calling on me..

that's just the way it goes
it's out of my control
you really never know now, here we go
raindrops keep on falling on me...
the people keep on calling on me..

raindrops keep on falling on me...
the people keep on calling on me..
raindrops keep on falling on me...
THE PEOPLE KEEP ON CALLING ON ME..</pre>
