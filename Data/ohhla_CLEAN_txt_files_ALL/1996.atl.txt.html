[Intro: Km.G]
Yeah, much dedication to Uno, Untro theatre
He loved that wicked shit
It's for nine six, too much mix
 
[Km.G]
Maybe me a picture, sweat as a memory
No enemies allowed or an able to get in to me
Hot, fills by body, makes my blood bail
Real mothafuckers, that was seven years loyal
We lost my niggaz six months ago
And people said: that we out to dark
But we remained thick think with shit, the Pimp Clinic niggaz and the Park
 
[Cold 187Um]
Cause see, cash rolls everything around
I'm lookin' for a bitch to take 10 of them things out town
Cause niggaz outta state got the proper price
A couple of fights, back and forth and we be head tight
You're tryin' to floss, sellin' dopes on the corner
It's 1996, lay you on some white sheet
If the Po-Pos done bitchin, them player haters willin'
I be sippin' on the Aliz√© way up on the hill
Waitin' for Tommika to check in
So we can grab the money, make a profit and Re-up again
Yeah, it's like my life's one way big hustle
Three sixty five mothafucker, three sixty five mothafucker
Three sixty five, yeah
 
[Chorus: Km.G]
What see, we're lettin' y'all niggaz know the mothafuckin' real
What see, how the mothafuckers, that get your fuckin' cap peeled
What see, we're lettin' y'all mothafuckers turn to the real
Cause I might right trip, Above the Law niggaz'll kill at will
 
[Km.G]
Come on, Km.G, no need to be limit again 
Count the money, so I can get wet, sweat that ass
Who can let the nigga smoke that hash?
There's too many glocks in the mothafuckin' stash
We can't walk through the clean part of town
Cause the skinny busters, nigga, might steal our fuckin' sound
And get draw down quick like quick gore
Talent bullets should be gone ?? more leave you hardcore
In stores, so what you need?
And we got that funk sack that wets your fuckin' feet
Take you to valley with the chirmin' in Alley
Niggaz shootin' bangers, California street gangsters
 
[Cold 187Um]
Ugh, I got the Infra Red set on the tech
Ready to roll on some punk-Ass-Niggaz tryin' to pop like the swole
Sayin' we put whack shit out
When they knew our first LP was rolled straight out of the Fatike house 
That's why I roll with the thickest
That's why they call me 178, and my style is the wickedest
Fuck the B-Boy the truck
I checked my nuts cause I be number one on the block, still gettin' fuck
Yo, I keep it real mothafucker
Still I am a murderer, still I am untouchable
That was like 1989 now it's 1996 
And the only thing changed is my cars and my tilt
And everything else remains the same
Still the same niggaz, still the same names
Ugh, and that name was Above the Law
Is that mothafucker, it's all I want
Yeah, I said it, I put that on my great aimin'
See I be true to this shit I be claimin'

Yeah, yo, yo, bring that shit back again we gonna blow you
You know, we're sick, I mean sick
 
[Chorus: Km.G]
What see, we're lettin' y'all niggaz know the mothafuckin' real
What see, how the mothafuckers, that get your fuckin' cap peeled
What see, we're lettin' y'all mothafuckers turn to the real
Cause I might right trip, Above the Law niggaz'll kill at will
 
[Outro: Cold 187Um]
Awww ahhh, awww ahhh, awww ahhh, time to keep it on the real
Awww ahhh, awww ahhh, awww ahhh, caps get peeled
Awww ahhh, awww ahhh, awww ahhh, time to keep it on the real
Awww ahhh, awww ahhh, awww ahhh</pre>
