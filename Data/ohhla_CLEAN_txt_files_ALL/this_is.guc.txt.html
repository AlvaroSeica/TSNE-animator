[Intro]
Dirty Birds in this motherfucker (ay yeah boyyy) It's Guc'!
Matter of fact it's Big Gucci in this motherfucker (ay yeah)
Flockaveli, Birdman (ay yeah boyyy)
Ca$h Money, Brick Squad linked up to 17 (BRICK SQUAD!!)

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
In the streets, make some moves, get my paper (this is what I do)
FUCK 'EM! Blow croak smoke on my haters (this is what I do)
Pop up with the real, fuck you fakers (this is what I do)
All about my money, fuck you pay me (this is what I do)
Huh? (This is what I do) Oh for real? (This is what I do)
Word? (This is what I do) Bitch! (This is what I do)
Huh? (This is what I do) Oh for real? (This is what I do)
Word? (This is what I do) Bitch! (This is what I do)

[Gucci Mane]
It's Big Gucci (ha) mob moves you wise fools
You can't mute me, my whole life I'm ProTools
First day appeal, just elude me or shoot me
I stand on my word, I'm like Luke in the 90's
Cocaine crazy, 1980 baby
2/12 they birthed me, now find me in Miami
East Atlanta with me, always to the Grammys
This time? Big bucks, no Whammies
My trunk slammin, my track jammin
I'm too fancy; manners I left 'em
I'm healthy, stealthy, and wealthy - you try me?
I'll probably show a nigga how to drive a jet ski
Them Brick Squad niggaz got me like I got me
Me, Flock and Baby back to Bankhead in real Bugatis
Brick Squad, Zone 6, Ca$h Money, whattup?
I might just fuckin buy my mom a Maserati

[Chorus]

[Waka Flocka Flame]
I got 6's on my red and black whip (this is what I do)
Watch them girls choose, iced up like a fool
Po'n lean in my styrogoam, this is how I Screw
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... ha! (Flock 'em!)
Flexin with the crew, mean muggin who?
Bad attitude, what'chu wanna do?
20 bottles, 40 blunts, meet me, on the moon (hold up)
Make it, make it rain, now my lil' bitch strippers come together, fame
Let my, pants hang, watch me, do my, chain swang
Takin, bitch mane, with this yellow, diamond, karat, chain
Waka, Flocka, Flame, Gucci, Gucci, Mane
With the Birdman, this is how we hang

[Chorus]

[OJ Da Juiceman]
(Ayyyy!) This is what I do, then I cut a damn fool
Man I come through Chevrolet, but it look gray Coupe
Get my money stack it up, this is what real players do (yessir)
Now if, he don't get no money then that nigga need to shoot
Smokin kush, at the house, while yo' bitch clean my shoe
Real gangsta nigga mayne, this is what I do
Say lil' potnah just hit me sayin "Man I need a deuce" (okay!)
So I hit him with the force, this is what I do
Killed yo' baby momma; this is what I do (damn!)
Work chipped cell phones, this is what I do
Rims on my car look like man they runnin out they shoe
With that blue 20 piece look like my backyard swimmin pool
