[Intro]
Mad game she was too damn fly
Gotta get that girl, I gotta get that girl
Yeah
Mad game she was too damn fly
Gotta get that girl, I gotta get that girl
This is a love song
Mad game she was too damn fly
Gotta get that girl, I gotta get that girl
Mad game she was too damn fly
Gotta get that girl, I gotta get that

[Verse 1]
Sit back and kick it for a minute or two
Let me tell you 'bout this ballin' ass bitch I knew
No joke, she'd leave a nigga broke quicker than shit
Hardcore, she'd leave a motherfucker dyin' for more
It was drama when you met her right up till she left
Therefore a lot of motherfuckers that met their death
No way to figure her out 'cause she was too complex
No way to leave her alone because she had mad sex
Had a body that could make the hardest nigga weak
Talked with her eyes, the homegirl really didn't really have to speak
Set ya up like a puppet then she'll blow you away
Different nigga, different sucker every fuckin' day
Mad game, she could talk like an angel
Make it seem so real, the girl had mad skill
To make a brother open up and spill his whole program
I seen the girl in action and I say 'goddamn'
If me and her could role we'd be like Bonnie and Clyde
Make a million dollars, buy some fat ass rides
Fly around the world and break a mark a day
Love it every minute 'cause we'd love to play
And this is somethin' that I just had to do
I had to get next to, this ballin' bitch I knew

(CHORUS)
Mad game she was too damn fly
Gotta get that girl, I gotta get that girl
Mad game she was too damn fly
Gotta get that girl, I gotta get that girl
This ballin' bitch I knew
Mad game she was too damn fly
Gotta get that girl, I gotta get that girl
Mad game she was too damn fly
I gotta get that girl, I gotta get that

[Verse 2]
Too fly when baby walked or talked
She had mad niggas stupid over her from L.A. to New York
Strap a nickel twenty-five to her thigh, don't try
Quick to catch a body, she pumped shotties
I had to have this girl
She was the baddest hustlin' apparatus, ass was the fattest, 'damn'
I stepped to her in the club and cracked a fly grin, 'what up'
Let the games begin
I hit her with a overload of high-tech dialect
Then it was set, she eyed my Rolex
I walked straight through her eyes into her head, 'psshh'
Moved some things around, made the bed
She looked at me like a slave set free
Asked me my name I told her 'Ice T'
She said she heard my name in the game
Said she heard I got juice, she said she heard I got fame
Huh, I gotta watch this expert in gassin', beatin' and breakin'
Bustin' and blastin'
I took her to her crib in my rag top ac
Spot was fat
Black leather and chrome to the dome
Twenty-fifth floor, leaded glass doors
She took me in her room and laid me down on her bed
The black widow's web
And now I'm thinkin' 'bout what to do
With this ballin' bitch I knew

(CHORUS)

[Verse 3]
She came in the bed head first like she was dying of thirst
Thought I would burst
But this was sexual competition
Lift her ass in the air, made my precision incision
I beat the pussy up like a Tyson fight
While I politely sixty-nined her all night
She had erotic super freaky sexy tongue techniques
Slipped down beneath, kissed my feet, uh
And even though the girl was great
I jumped off the pussy, kicked back and watched her masturbate
Next day she called me 'the king'
Kissed my ring
Said I made her hormones sing
Then she opened up a closet full of fly men's clothes
All my size, couldn't believe my eyes
Then she broke into tears
Told me how she wanted me near
Said she watched my style for years
Cracked the safe, there had to be at least a hundred g's
And said 'please'
Let me be your true, I'll do whatever you want me to
I'll hold the world for you, 'right'
She kicked the ?? and the choice was me
And now I got a down ass gee
When we hit this together just like Bonnie and Clyde
Made a million dollars, bought some fat ass rides
Flew around the world and broke a mark a day
Lovin' every minute 'cause we love to play
And for me she turned to be this hustler's troop
Somehow I got next to, that ballin' bitch I knew

[Outro]
Mad game she was too damn fly
Somehow I got that girl, somehow I got that girl
Mad game she was too damn fly
Somehow I got that girl, somehow I got that girl
This ballin' bitch I knew
Mad game she was too damn fly
Somehow I got that girl, somehow I got that girl
Mad game she was too damn fly
Somehow I got that girl, somehow I got that

Hustler's dream</pre>
