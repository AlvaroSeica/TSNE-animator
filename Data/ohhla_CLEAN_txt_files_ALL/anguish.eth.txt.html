Song:   Anguish

[Verse 1]
I been conditioned since before I denied being a Christian
In denial, on trial, I fire
Entire worlds collapse with the weight of mere words
Words construct a sanctuary that changes in a day
In a way, it makes sense as dense images fade
And I take time to forget the finer things in life
Despite not understanding this numbing sensation
I'll cave in probably before I'll prevail
I'll excel pass places others promised to fail
Success is subjective and dismantles the collective
As remedies erase duality
Dueling, ruining my blissful ignorance
Refueling my renaissance
I'm lost seeking to be found, listening for sound
Wearing this crown fa√ßade proudly
The proud be plaguing my insecurities
As I nervously ask you to murder me
It's sure to be an identity resurrection
With childhood memories I keep on forgetting
And this continued condition's proving contagious
As I am Ethic and Ethic has become anguish

[Chorus]
Have you ever felt this way?
Or am I the only one?
Anguish has taken a place in my heart
And all I can do is run away

[Verse 2]
Transform this child of the storm
Scorned, as thorns scar my sight without unveiling itself
Unconditional love seems to have guidelines
Landmines placed on an already narrow trail
Driven by desire to be driven by the third nail
And somewhere in my walk I'm bound to pick myself up
But if you give me your hand, I'll be eternally grateful
While as a human I have trouble discerning what is distasteful
I'm playful when it comes to matters of life and death
First and last breath being taken and being left
With the ability to hold truth to what I can accept
And I know lust better than I know respect
And I don't cuss, but that don't make your mind darker than mine
I've seen the abyss and done things people would find
Strange to say the least (deranged) feed the beast
I've recently required a need to live in peace
As footprints in the sand speak with the weight of words
I live in the hourglass struggling to be heard
And I've covered quiet land in search of language
As I am Ethic and Ethic is anguish

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Isolated stares into an island backdrop
I can't stop considering where I'll be in a few
Years from today with a new outlook on everything
That at one time may have made a difference
As major turns into minor, I give no resistance
I'm a terrible witness and need not fake being convinced, it's
Gonna work out, though I hold tight to the faith I have
I've always been one to take too much of a bad thing
I live in extremes and I'm not who I seem
A cry for help need not play out traditional scenes
Hiding behind laughter
Held up by missed prayer of omega K4 is on plasma
Watch as I shatter right here on this track
'Cause what I'm speaking today I wish I could take back
And act like there's nothing compressing my brain
Pretend like I'm happy and only ethic remains
The fact is right now there's a lot to sort out
I'm swimming in doubt and surviving on hope
And I can live without an answer now if that's required
But I feel this empire's been built on the guilt of its sire
And reconstructions in order from the ground level
A requiem for order, pierce me like metal
Blades of awakening, beginning his banish
As Ethic slowly separates from his anguish

[Chorus] x 2</pre>
