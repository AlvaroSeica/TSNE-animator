[Break - Sample]
Didn't want to do it
Didn't want to break your heart
Didn't want to do it
Break it from the very start

[Chorus]
Drunken nights I wish I
Never played myself I
Didn't wake up so fucked up that I could actually touch the sky

[Reks - talking over the end of the Chorus]
Uh huh, uh huh
Yeah, yeah
Check, yeah

[Verse 1 - Reks]
Many drunken nights I
Woked up so fucked up I touched the Heaven gates as I elevate
Think about my hellish day
And it ain't me and the E, it's Hennessy
Me and Statik be sippin on somethin 'til we gone
'Til I'm on, I will be, Dom not PÃ©rignon
But poems I'm heavy on, I see the dead and gone
In my songs, they are me, we are one
Play myself some, times too many, one mind on Remy
Mar', Jimmy cause, so much drama for me
Can't we all just get along? Anyone feel me?
Problems and where they come from, please tell me
To my moms I am sorry, so sorry that I cause you pain
J.F.K., I know you know what I'm sayin
I'm flowin again, by wakin up so fucked up until I touch the sky
On them drunken nights

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Joe Scudda]
Uh, many drunken nights I, woke up empty liquor bottles around me
Beside a strange bitch, 'cause that's where they found me
I don't even know her name but no reason to explain
'Cause the stupid shit I did, I'm a probably do again
And, you can bet your bottom buck on it
Take a swig of the beer, here from the tables with the cups on it
Lord knows I be sinnin
But when I'm drunk, everybody knows I be grinnin
Sorry if I'm offendin, people thumpin them Bibles
'Cause I'm libel, to do anything they say ain't tribal
So relax and fall back
Early morning smokes, now I'm happy as hell, I found an old pack
Inhale, exhale, think about last night's details
But they hard to recall
Guess the alcohol, got my head bangin
And me sayin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - J.F.K.]
Uh, yeah, yeah, drunken nights, once or twice, so down on my luck
Straight lost sight, late night creepin, I was up
Stole the whips, chased by the Staties
Locked down, missin our babies
What you missin is crazy, right?
My crazy life, some day maybe stop bein lazy
Spend my days free
Tryin to be a citizen with a buck sheep
Like it's him again, judge got a grudge and a grin
We huggin the bend
The fast life, you crash hard, that's life
You past regard, nevertheless we play hard
Life's a hangover with a sick sense of humor
I would change over
Over and over again
We live through these drunken nights hopin they don't end

[Break]

[Chorus]</pre>
