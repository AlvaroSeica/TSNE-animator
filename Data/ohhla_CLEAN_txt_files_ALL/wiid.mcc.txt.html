Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there

We're smokin' that Danger Girl
We're smokin' that Gen 13
Bong's called Yoda, man
and Yoda can't a bag filled with stems and seeds
Yo, I can't stand no ecstacy
Cocaine made a mess of me
Beer and booze are now things that I use to do
Don't misconstrue, I'm still abusin' weed
Some kids like to get fucked up
actin' black by rollin' them blunts
I got a one hitter called Margot Kidder
and I only need to hit that shit once
'cause I ain't made of nickels and dimes
Fat kind make me tickled inside
Say no to cuttin' up lines
that's one-point-twenty-one jiggawatt jive
And I ain't no Nancy Reagan
just sayin' kinda take it slow
Say yeah to the jazz cigarette
say nil to the thrills of pills and blow
Teen years about gettin' beat down
and your twenties 'bout smokin' them pounds
Stick around for the sticky amounts
flick a Bic 'til your stuck to the couch
I'm the sativa cyborg
I smell that shit like a wine cork
I hope they never legalize
then High Times won't have anything to fight for
I used to smoke with kids at shows
but I stopped 'cause they all had colds
but I got Emergen-C and a bag of Coldeeze
and mad trees so let's all get stoned!

Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there

After a show, you're a friend of mind
handshake with a prize inside
These are Batman Begins hallucinagens
These whammies are weaponized
LSD and shrooms, I tried them
was a time when I wouldn't deny them
All you need is one trip where you lose your shit
kiss goodbye to the sky with diamonds;
but I keep coming back like it's Atkins fat
'cause the weed's like crack cocaine
but the risk you take is just getting baked
you're surely gonna see the next day
They say we fund Al Qaeda
Sounds like the government's jealous
Let's get the enemy stoned
bring our ninjas home - to hell with Christian zealots
'cause all we need is some weed and a laid back beat
black lights if you stereotype
couple bean bag chairs and a lack of airs
a marathon of price is right
What's the 4-1-1 for realzies?
I freeze my Reese's Pieces
It's like everytime I pack a pipe
my appetite suddenly increases
You know what a cracka mean
green leaves my cractorbeam
addicted like it's gasoline, just pass the trees
while I live that cracker dream
but I might have to cease my deeds
I might have to take control
'cause I ain't down with little mc
growin' up in a cloud of my second-hand smoke

Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there
Weed is by my side, it's always been there
Always been there, always been there</pre>
