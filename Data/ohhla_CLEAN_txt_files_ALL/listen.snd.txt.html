I'm introspective and introverted
So it ain't nothin' to drop an introduction 
The introduction goes how I word it 
A lot of my concepts have been concerted 
So it's not consequence that I'm confident 
You feel the ambiance, become confidants 
Confederate flags hang high down here 
Where we hung many a year 
A mint of terms to endear 
Doubtless currency 
Can't oust this prince up south, invincible 
Everybody's callin' you Vince 
I'm a winner so they started callin' me Victor 
But I say we all just stick to 
Bavu Adimu Malika Blakes (thanks, man) 
No I'm witcha we finna' like paint a picture 
Resonate like seashell sounds, near effortless 
Or so it seems, perception is reality 
Still definite 

I seduce you by the ears, listeners 
Nice and tight because I've been at it for years, listeners 
Anyone able to hear, listen up, listeners 
As if it wasn't evident 
I'm on a never half-hesitant mission of 
National noise without fear listeners 
That natural poise image clear listeners 
Unmistakably me, wordsmith, standout, straight adidas 
never gearshift, never see me with my hand out 
I been, working on my own career, listeners 
And now, playing with somebody's money's near, listeners 
Oughta be audibly attractive back to the rear in the club, listeners 
Go 'head and get your buzz 
I'm fully aware of what my verb sack does 
It makes females prefer to feel my big diction 
But I'd be ignorant to use that metaphor for 
How dudes be diggin' it 
Gleam megawatt hot filaments 
Imaginary figments can't f wit' it 
Among jiggy whippersnappers 
Down to tacky Punky Brewster rappers 
Still definite 

Hazardous to whole hemispheres, listeners 
Dazzle crowds, control interference, listeners 
Listen up, I point a sista out in the crowd 
I'm so excited 
My black folks together proud although divided 
A track just lacks a flow I'll write it 
Or stand up and automatically put it 
Down and it'll be altogether good it 
Pounds in my center 
Begins up in my inner 
Even a winner will lose if he ill-prepares, listeners 
We oughta stop all that mean mouth twisting, us 
Just actin' a fool, if you keep your head steady 
I promise to put it on tilt quick when you're ready 
Start when you're ready rappers 
When it's worth your time 
My flow blows with the wind 
And it's like I'm the chime, listeners 
Performing it well because I'm preppin' it 
Becomin' your preference to spit skill 
Still definite</pre>
