"Rollin' on the one" [x3]

[Verse One]
Like this ha
You never know really
Whether they foe or friendly
Got drama? I'm gonna try to get it over quickly
I'm like, "Oh really? You ain't a soldier silly."
I couple scuffles don't add to a war silly
Even the greediest of people don't want it with me
Got 'em thinkin' dissin' Blueprint; sorta risky
I leave 'em sort of dizzy, like they drinkin' port of whiskey
Or hit the el Jesus, shout out to John Whiskey
My shit the bombdigi
Come sing along with me
No Ls all Ws, I'm Bobby Digi
You like Bobby Jimmy
Or Com and Diddy
Write a lie and anybody with a story feel me
I write the fire even if it's feelin' cold and chilly
Then send a shorty from my block to the store for phillies
I write the fire even if it's feelin' cold and chilly

Then send a shorty from my block to the store for phillies 

[Blueprint Speaking]
C'mon man. Ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I ain't tell you motherfuckers. Ain't nobody fuckin' with me

[Verse Two]
This is the day to day
Rip the papermate
Write a banger get it played in a major way
If you a stranger to the game you gotta pay to play
I get the dame, then the fame then fade away
My freestyle is my saving grace
But I still hold down the writtens just like a paper weight
So even cats that claim to hate
Have to ad-mit that Print spits the gospels with Amazing Grace
Mind state's 88
Beats with crazy bass
Before the MP3s, double decks makin' tapes
The fist fight era where the worst was a razor blade
You can get slashed but still live to fight a later day
But now-a-days they make it so you can't escape
They put you on ice, not let you skate away
This is the day to day, gotta get my paper straight
Cause the crooked people made me wait
Who told you bein' lazy pays? They was wrong
Chillin' til your face is gray then you're dead and gone
I'm here to pave the way and do it on my own
Printmatic is back to save the day with a song
So move back

Outro [Blueprint speaking]
Fuckin'...c'mon on man. How long I been gone? 
Y'all ain't got no better. I do this for real man
Y'all still sorry. Suckin' and shit. I'm still the hardest out</pre>
