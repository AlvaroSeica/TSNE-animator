Say Delwin, don't you think it's about time
we show the whole world, how we be mobbin?

DCF Styles
Mob, mob we mobbin on them

I pull up to the club and I'm feeling real fresh
I got something in my cup that's got me laid back
if it aint about money I aint trying to hear that
I got that feeling in my body, now I'm really
You see me mobbin on them, oh I'm mobbin on them
oh I'm mobbin on them, you see me mobbin on them
oh I'm mobbin on them, oh I'm mobbin on them, oh I'm mobbin on them
you see me mobbin on them

Ol Kimosabe, mane. I'm feeling out my body
I'm tooled up in the club, so don't even try me
Lortab and xanax bar
Listen, got them by the zillion
() for looking at me, but tonight I'm really chilling
taking picture after picture in the booth just stunting
drug money, club money, that's how I'm living, yeah I love it
It's a full moon tonight, because, tonight, I'm showing my ass
I'm only 18 and I can make it rain like that

I got the whole world mobbin, even in afghanistan
Main topic of '08, so (holmes) don't hate
Xanax bars and purple lean got me mobbin through your way
I am feeling kind of woozy but I'm moving so groovy
getting straight to the point, fuck the dinner and the movie
so, what are you hollering, I really aint trying to hear it
just mobbin on you clowns, while you standing there, I'm jigging

I pull up to the club and I'm feeling real fresh
I got something in my cup that's got me laid back
if it aint about money I aint trying to hear that
I got that feeling in my body, now I'm really
You see me mobbin on them, oh I'm mobbin on them
oh I'm mobbin on them, you see me mobbin on them
oh I'm mobbin on them, oh I'm mobbin on them, oh I'm mobbin on them

dark locs got a nigga feeling in the matrix
mobbin to the beat, trying to see what the deal is
mobbin through the club, stepping all on niggas tennis shoes
do what you do, but watch my shoes)
Mane, go on holmes, fuck you
Leaning got my eyes low, but I'm still mobbin
Oh, the DJ  playing my song, so I'm about to act a show
59 red bone, nickname stallion
bring her to the VIP, get lil momma on that dome
I see you trying to fuck something, bring the hoe to 31st
beat it up properly, then get her out her purse
Money over bitches, that's what a real nigga hollers
I flip 100 nine ways, yeah ask the streets about me
I flipped a half of zone, making nothing out of something
making money getting money, that's the way that I'm coming
mobbin on you, say nussie, tell them how we mobbin on them
back to back sneak attack tell them how we mobbin on them

I pull up to the club and I'm feeling real fresh
I got something in my cup that's got me laid back
if it aint about money I aint trying to hear that
I got that feeling in my body, now I'm really
You see me mobbin on them, oh I'm mobbin on them
oh I'm mobbin on them, you see me mobbin on them
oh I'm mobbin on them, oh I'm mobbin on them, oh I'm mobbin on them
