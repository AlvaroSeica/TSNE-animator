Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yo should be rolling up by now

Knowing I'm a look
Cool in them
Black and white pictures
When they talk about
Underground rappers
Gettin high and making history
I'm sick and tired these niggaz
Claiming they as sick as me
They lying I checked your chart
Your file saying you soft
Something fishy ho nigga
You more bass then boss
Off the boat small fries
And store a ways get toss
Can't party on the shore with us fool
Get your floaters up kitty pool nigga's
Ain't really that cool
Can't farther these moves
You need more expensive shoes
Working out smoking strong
On a week long cruise
Bomb fire with theses bitches
Singing songs to the moon
To high to judge
Call my ex bitch that did foul shit
Fuck her brains out and settle the grudge
Back shot revenge style
Ain't no love light gro roll up after a quick scrub
Cover my trace don't let my bitch know where I was
Sticking to the script thought I'm improvising a bit
Same as my old G's but I put the Jets in the mix
Classic like Eddie Murphy SNL skits
Dead stock tissue in the box elephant print
On my flint 13's no retro 3m reflective
Ya bitch tight reckless and my DM'S sexting tryna see him
Smoke a J where he being but I got no time for company
I'm billing on of them hundred I know that's why you want me
success is my cologne I spray that bottle all on me...
yea... yea jet life...</pre>
