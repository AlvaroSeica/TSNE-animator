[Intro: Pharrell]
E'rybody get up (WOO!)
E'rybody get up
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey (woo!)

[Robin Thicke] + (Pharrell)
Turn me up
If you can't hear, what I'm tryna say (hey girl, c'mere!)
If you can't read, from the same page
Maybe I'm goin deaf (hey hey hey) maybe I'm goin blind (hey hey hey)
Maybe I'm out of my (hey hey hey) miiiiiind (e'rybody get up)

[Interlude: Robin Thicke] + (Pharrell)
Okay now he was close, tried to domesticate ya
But you're an animal, baby it's in your nature
Just let me liberate ya (hey hey hey) you don't need no papers (hey hey hey)
That man is not your maker (hey hey hey) and that's why I'ma take a

[Chorus: Robin Thicke] + (Pharrell)
Good girl! I know you want it
I know you want it, I know you want it
You're a good girl! Can't let it get past me
You're far from plastic, talk about gettin blasted
I hate these blurred lines! I know you want it
I know you want it, I know you want it
But you're a good girl! The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty, go 'head get at me (e'rybody get up)

[Robin Thicke] + (Pharrell)
What do they make dreams for, when you got them jeans on
What do we need steam for? You the hottest bitch in this place!
I feel so lucky (hey hey hey) you wanna hug me (hey hey hey)
What rhymes with hug me? (Hey hey hey) Heyyyyyy (e'rybody get up)

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[T.I.]
Hustle Gang homie, le'go!
Ay say Rob, let me holla at 'em right quick

One thing I ask of you
Let me be the one you back that ass up to
Go, from Malibu to Paris boo
Yeah, I had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you're passin through
I'll give you somethin big enough to tear yo' ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable
In a, hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde bitch, you +Pass Me By+
Nothin like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull yo' hair for you
So I'm, just watchin, and waitin
For you to salute the truly pimpin
Not many women can refuse this pimpin
I'm a nice guy, but don't get it confused here baby!

[Robin Thicke] + (Pharrell)
Shake your rump, get down
Get up-a...
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
What you don't like work? Heyyyyyeahhhhhhey!
Baby can you breathe? I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me, Dakota to Decatur
No more pretendin (hey hey hey) cause now you're winnin (hey hey hey)
Here's our beginnin (hey hey hey) I always wanted a

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro: Pharrell]
E'rybody get up
E'rybody get up
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
