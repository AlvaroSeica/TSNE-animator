I see a message from the government, like every day
I watch it, and listen, and call 'em all suckas
They warnin' me about Osama or whatever
Picture me buyin' this scam I said never

You in tune to a Hard Truth Soldier spittin
I stay committed gives a fuck to die or lose commission
It's all a part of fightin' devil state mind control
And all about the battle for your body mind and soul

And now I'm hopin' you don't close ya mind - so they shape ya
Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us AIDS and raped us
Another Bush season mean another war for profit
All in secret so the public never think to stop it
The illuminati triple 6 all connected
Stolen votes they control the race and take elections
It's the Skull and Bones Freemason kill committee
See the Dragon gettin' shittier in every city

What would you do if you
knew all of the things we know
Would you stand up for truth
Or would you turn away too?

And then what if you saw
All of the things that's wrong
Would you stand tall and strong?
Or would you turn and walk away..

Now ask yourself who's the one with the most to gain (Bush)
'Fore 911 motherfuckas couldn't stand his name (Bush)
Now even niggas waivin' flags like they lost they mind
Everybody got opinions but don't know the time

'Cause America's been took - it's plain to see
The oldest trick in the book is MAKE an enemy
Of phony evil so the government can do it's dirt
And take away ya freedom lock and load, beat and search

Ain't nothin' changed but more colored people locked in prison
These pigs still beat us but it seem we forgettin
But I remember 'fore Septmember how these devils do it
Fuck Guliani ask Diallo how he doin

We in the streets holla jail to the thief - followv Fuck wavin' flags bring these dragons to they knees
Oil blood money make these killers ride cold
Suspicious suicides people dyin' never told

It's all a part of playin' God so ya think we need 'em
While Bin Ashcroft take away ya rights to freedom
Bear witness to the sickness of these dictators
Hope you understand the time brother cause it's major

What would you do if you
knew all of the things we know
Would you stand up for truth
Or would you turn away too?

And then what if you saw
All of the things that's wrong
Would you stand tall and strong?
Or would you turn and walk away..

So now you askin why my records always come the same
Keep it real, ain't no fillers, motherfuck a blingin
Mine eyes seen the gory of the coming of the beast
So every story every word I'm sayin' Fuck Peace

See you could witness the illuminati bodycount
Don't be surprised these is devils that I'm talkin' bout
You think a couple thousand lives mean shit to killers?
Nigga I swear to God we the ones - ain't no villans

Or any other word they think to demonize a country
Ain't no terror threat unless approval ratings slumpin
So I'ma say it for the record we the ones that planned it
Ain't no other country took a part or had they hand in

Just a way to keep ya scary so you think you need 'em
Praisin' Bush while that killer take away ya freedom
How many of us got discovered but ignore the symptoms?
Niggas talkin' loud but ain't nobody sayin' shit

And with the 4th Amendment gone eyes are on the 1st
That's why I'm spittin' cyanide each and every verse
I see the Carlyle group and Harris Bank Accounts
I see 'em plead the 5th each and every session now

And while Reichstag burns see the public buy itv I see the profilin' see the media's compliance
War is good for business see the vicious make a savior
Hope you understand the time brother cause it's major

What would you do if you
knew all of the things we know
Would you stand up for truth
Or would you turn away too?

And then what if you saw
All of the things that's wrong
Would you stand tall and strong?
Or would you turn and walk away..</pre>
