[Intro: Young Jeezy &amp; T.I.]
Crem' de la crem' homey, top shelf you know
I like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low
down low, down low, down low, I like my top let back
Let back, let back, let back let back, let back
Chea you already know what this shit is nigga, remix nigga
Mannie Fresh, T.I.P whatup nigga?, I got'cha nigga
I'ma show these niggaz what to do on you nigga..

[Young Jeezy]
I let my chain hang low get that thing up on my waist
All then haters talkin reckless tell 'em say it to my face
Can see a bankroll yeah I almost caught a case
It's the remix so Mannie Fresh drop the bass
I say now twenty-eight inches got me sitting so high
Reach straight up through the clouds God damn I'm in the sky
Got my eighty-seven zone God dammit I'm fly
Bet you anything won't nann' nigga try it
I push the look come wednesday the drop that Monday
Ice cream Impala same color as a sundae
So you can miss me with that hatin and that "He can't rap shit"
Tell them faggot-ass niggaz wrap they lips around my dick
God damn my money sick, ayy I need to see a doctor
Black on black Bentley call it "Phantom of the Opera"
Lemon lime droptop I call it a Sprite
When I pull out the garage you can call it at night

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Young Dro]
DRO! My trunk gon' break the damn law
I'm ridin through the hood with eighths of damn raw
Them twenty-sevens tall but them eights are damn raw
Bitches know they see the platinum is grey like grandpa
Spray the Chevy all kinda sour apple colors
Diamonds up in my charm look like pineapple suckers
Tec-9 for some, mac-90 for others
Leave the weapon on Bucatti's I got on my Danny Glovers
Nah this ain't a movie but I shot "4 Brothers"
And plus I gotta Chevelle that flop four colors
Cars without the covers, my beat down low
I let my rims sit high I'm the best thing blowin now Dro!!

[Chorus]

[Big Kuntry]
I got my treble up high and my beat down low
I don't slam no doors hop in where the roof go
What I need a roof fo', replace it with the sky
Streets be mine with that Georgia on my mind
I ride in the wettest paint, like I'm surfin on a tidal wave
Cocaine whip yeah straight out the microwave
Man in the trunk sound like the man knockin
Five pass rockin with stacks in my pockets

[Verse 4: B.G.]
I got money in my pocket and mind on whoa!
To hear myself think I like my beat down low
Cigarello full of 'dro and the chevy two-toned
It's sittin on chrome that's how I get my roll on
Gotta dip through the hood you know Gizzle keep it real
I see some hot girls so I'm a turn it up a lil'
Let them bounce to the music ba-bounce to the beat
The top down hop in and ride with a G

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Even though I like my beat down low and my top let back
Chrome feet down low and my impala wet back
Ditch or dash, hit the gas tell them niggaz check that
Make them bitches sit back woofers give 'em wet cast
Comin down in a Chevy motor sound like it very tight
It is you can tell I hear the tire yellin er' lane
And the way they ain't kickin I bet
You could still hear it loaf of bread I cut it up a bit
I get left feel here
Okay my money real big, choppers is still here
They catch me with it fuck it I'm doing my lil bit
And my drop top ridin with my glock cocked ridin
I'm looking for them niggaz where they at stop hidin hey!

Now that's a motherfuckin remix nigga</pre>
