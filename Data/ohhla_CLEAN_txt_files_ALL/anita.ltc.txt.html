[LTC]
Anita you know, that I'm crazy for you
Because you can keep me trippin like my favorite brew
And that I understand, so I'll never switch
Cause I'll always be down with my gangster bitch
And when women approach, you make them ghost
Talkin about stop sweatin him, or your legs are broke

[Chorus]
(Anita you know, that I'm crazy for you)
(Cause you can keep me trippin like my favorite brew)
(And that I understand, so I'll never switch)
(Cause I'll always be down with my gangster bitch)

[LTC]
Oh Anita, you're so damn crazy, with your cookie crew
With your earrings on, and they jinglin too
And you know what I mean
Knockin the boots is a daily routine
And that makes me happy, when Jimmy is bliss
and tearin up the nappy with the roughneck style
Into frontin rude
But when I'm with you, I kill the attitude
and act much sweeter for my Anita

[Chorus]

[LTC]
Oh, Anita, you're so fine
To say the least and no Dana Dane
It ain't Anita the Beast, but Anita the cutey
A five foot three with the ghetto booty
The baby got back and that ain't no joke
Pass her the chronic and she'll take a toke
With a nine in her purse, she'll put you in a hearse
And at the same time, put on her lipstick
Put hoes down and ride on my dipstick
And that's why we understand each other
First we're friends, and then we're lovers

[Chorus]
