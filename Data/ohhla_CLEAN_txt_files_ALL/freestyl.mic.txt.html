[Hook: Iron Mic (sample)]
Nigga I'm trynna make (a million)
No time to waste I need (a million)
Uh-huh, niggas'll rob you for (a million)
Niggas'll kill you for (a million)
Nigga I sign for (a million)
Uh-huh, pull out the nine for (a million)

[Iron Mic]
Yo, lotta speculation on the click I claim
Ruthless, that's my gang
Are they real for real, do they spit them thangs
Why they ain't come out when they signed with Wu-Tang
Why the streets screaming for us, we the best in the game
Why after all this time them niggas ain't change
They ain't learn a lesson yet, still popping off chains
Still hustle on the block, still serving that caine
Well you know what they say, only the real remain
You can catch me on the strip, selling coke in the rain
But I'm trynna blow in this rap shit, that's my aim
No daddy growing up, nigga, feel my pain
If I'm a bastard, you a bastard, we both one in the same
One out of every four children is raised with no pops
While you were playing hopscotch, we played with those glocks
Lotta ice in your watch, we coming for those rocks
And if you sitting on top, we coming for you spot

[Chorus: Iron Mic]
Ya'll know, what's up, with us
Ya'll get, hit up, we bust

[Beno]
Now what the fuck you gon' do, when I'm coming for you
Run and get your goon, fuck it, get your gun to
Just in a minute to leave, you best to believe
Do not fuck with the cut and, front of your seed
I snake all the weed, and drink all the liquor
I don't pop E, but I pop me a nigga
And no, I don't listen to jazz
But I hear you kick the blues when bullets hitting ya ass
Round the way, they call me Robin Hood, now why's that
Cuz all I do around the way is rob in the hood
Ain't giving shit away, like it was all good
Got niggas under pressure like my name was Suge
Fuck wit me, nigga, I don't think you should
Fuck me up nigga, I don't think you could
Cuz I burn and break niggas like they was made of wood

[Chorus]</pre>
