Typed by: AZ Lyrics

A man should be judge by the quality of his work
Not by the quality of his piss
I aint gonna piss in a cup for no man
I aint gonna piss in a cup for no man
I aint gonna piss ni a cup for no man
Cause thats the ultimate personal invasion
I aint gonna piss in a cup for no man
I aint gonna piss in a cup for no man
I aint gonna piss ni a cup for no man
Cause thats the ultimate personal invasion
Piss test piss test gotta take a piss test
Piss test piss test gotta take a test
I aint gonna piss in a cup for no man
Cause thats the ultimate personal invasion
I aint gonna piss in a cup for no man
I aint gonna piss in a cup for no man
I aint gonna piss in a cup for no man
Cause thats the ultimate personal invasion
Piss test piss test gotta take a piss test
Piss test piss test gotta take a piss test
Piss test piss test gotta take a test
A man should be judge by the quality of his work
Not by the quality of his piss
Piss test piss test
Its time to take a test</pre>
