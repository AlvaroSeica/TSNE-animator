What up hops?Time to get paid again
Crowd growin',shoulda been knowin
You should have stayed and when
I told you I'll be back in full color
Look at yourself ummm wella
Is what you said as you bop your head
To a new groove that improves that movement
Don't worry there's no way I'm losin'
It's down pat like paint and shellack
And as a matter of fact
I'm wearing timberlands roof of the world full length
And I'm kickin' it on the strength

On the strenght
Straight across the counter
On the strenght
No prescription at all
On the strenght
Tylenol,Codeine
On the strenght
You see what I mean,Dig this...

Prohibit,exhibit spirit I share it
The laws a jah me father and I live it
Rules from a man with undestanding
Sing and bring souls ring about everything
Being started,very underrated
Rhyming all about yourself it outdated
And you waiting,anticipating
For something dope and DEF and innovating
&gt;From me you see it's not easy to be
The last lion from Mount Zion
Hard like iron
Never give up I just keep on tryin'
Free as a bird now the world is safe
And I'm stone cold kickin it,on the strength

On the strenght
Straight across the counter
On the strenght
No prescription at all
On the strenght
Tylenol,Codeine
On the strenght
You see what I mean,Dig this...

Shakers be,shakin',people be,breakin'
Show so nitro,girlies be faintin'
Medics be layin'
They know I'm not playin'
On the strenght,you know what I'm sayin'?
Strenght is the power,all on the hour
Or force do anybody got strenght?Of course!
I'm gettin hoarse cause it's pumpin like the feds
&gt;From each and every corner people boppin' their heads
Instead of arguing,bitin',fightin' and fussin'
You're  Afro-American so won't you stop rushin'
The rap that I'm bustin,so dope it's disgusting
Trustin' what's in store for sure
As you and yours fill all dance floors
Cause when GET FRESH rain,we storm
Or work on an encore while we're on tour
Or like I said to you once before
Wearin' Timberlands Roof of the World,full length
And I'm stone cold kickin' it 

On the strength</pre>
