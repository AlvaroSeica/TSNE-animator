Cheaaa
Ay you kno I'm lookin for a 5 star chick talkin bout (bur)
I'm talkin about a bitch lookin like she jus stepped out a magazine
I'm talkin niggaz I'm gon be somethin serious

[Gucci Mane]
Gotti here go twelve bars
Gucci mane got 9 cars
We dnt call em dimes no more
09' we call em 5 stars
I'm a 5 star nigga, dis a 5 star clique
That's a 645, this that new m6
Pay her bills get her hair fixed
Might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me
Best money I ever spent
I can't even lie (why)
I'm so super high (high)
Do not need her, will not keep her
Unless she superly
Gucci Mane's a thug B
Ya man is a scrub see
She loves me now
She loves you not
Yea all me bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta
Look up Gucci gurl and beep me
And we cand find a 5 star hotel
You can meet me

(Chorus)
That's a 5 star chick (3x)
Man that's a 5 star chick, if yo credit score high
Feet and nails stay fly, keep your juice box wet
And ya head sum'n fine
You a five star chick (4x)
I want a five star chick
I need a 5 star chick
I need a 5 star chick
I want a five star chick

[Yo Gotti]
It's ya boy yo gotti
I do grade A shit
I'm the realist nigga walkin
And this the remix,
And still I'm out here lookin
For a 5 star chick
When I catch her,
Ima bless her
With a 5 star kiss
She a natural born hustla
She ain't chasin no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga
She ain't never fucked a busta
So ya cars nd ya jewlery
That she really don't excite
And all them hatin ass hoes
In the club wanna fight her
She was born in the "A"
Went to school in DC
Gotta job in Dallas Texas
Then moved to tennessee
If you aint a 5 star
Need to go ahead and face it
Fake gucci fake louie
Shawty dat'll make you basic

[Chorus]
Dat aint a 5 star chick
It aint a 5 star chick (3x)

[Trina]
See I'm a 5 star bitch
Cause I aint that other bitch
She been stugglin for hers
From the womb I been rich
I aint gotta talk about the money
And the shoe game
All you gotta do is google trina
See the proof mane?
Cause aint none of these hoes,
Doin shows in the recession
They cards get declined,
Now they sufferin a depression
While I'm spendin mills
Signin all kinda deals
I'm a 5 star bitch,
Eating 5 star meals
My whole life style
Like comin to America
All my Louie luggage
You see my bag?
How I carry her
Walkin through the airport
Like I'm in a parade on my hologram
Loggin on to e-Trade

[Chorus]
That's a 5 star chick (4x)
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice box wet, and your hear sum'n fine
You a five star chick (4x)
I want a five star chick
I need a 5 star chick
I need a 5 star chick
I want a five star chick

[Nicki Minaj]
I just had a epiphany
I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers
Cause my cookies always slippery
I don't need help
I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin "fuck em"
With a dildo sign
Five little mama, you a Three star
I aint sleepin when
I say I'm in my dream car
Oh did I stutta?
Harajuku hyphen
Barbie... I'm hot
I think it's time to put the rice in
I was sittin in the chair
I was just gluing my weave in
When you hit the stage
They was booin and leavin
Young money red flag
No more auditions
Ask Lil Wayne who the 5 star bitch is!

[Chorus]
That's a 5 star chick (4x)
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice box wet, and your hear sum'n fine
You a five star chick (4x)
I want a five star chick
I need a 5 star chick
I need a 5 star chick
I want a five star chick

[Nicci Rea]
5 star baby
Let me tell you how I do
Baby I'm the baddest bitch around
I'm not fonkin wit ya crew
I'm the head bitch in charge
Who the fuck wanna fuck with me
All louie, new gucci
Air nikes on my feet
Look at my nails, my hair I'm sexy can't you c
Body stay dipped
It get no better den me
I'm on the track with Nicki, Trina, Gucci and Gotti
Everybody know my life's a ROCKSTAR PARTY

[Chorus]
That's a 5 star chick (3x)</pre>
