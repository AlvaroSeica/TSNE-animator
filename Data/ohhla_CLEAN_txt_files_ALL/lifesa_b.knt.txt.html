Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
Yeah, she's life, role model for her
She's trife, one sip'll get the bottle gone
Oddisee on the beat
I like that sound, bring it, bring the drums
Yeah, c'mon, yeah
Role model for 'em, you want the whole bottle gone
Nothing's like her, understand?
Yeah, yeah, it's like
She's trife, make you wanna sip the whole bottle gone
She's like nothin, nothing's like her...

[Verbal Kent]
Yo, when I was youn I thought life would be rich and fun
But now I'm old and know that life is a bitch with a gun (BANG~!)
She aims it at you when you think you got her figured out
And then she laughs at you and sticks the barrel in your mouth
She mocks everythin you stand for
Therefore you fare horribly, at almost everythin you care for
Bear for, breakin my umbrella in a hail storm
Wonder what the devil's got a shovel and a pail for?
I'm not one to bitch, usually the rational
Passed the point of bein passive by far
I need to mention she reminds me, finds me
Every time someone is standin behind me
Power to blind me, but thanks bitch!!
I really need you sneakin up on me now
What's with you givin me the shot? What's with you buckin me down?
I always heard she likes to teach you when you least it expect it
And some would say she only sees you when she needs attention

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
She's like queen of the bitches, the role model for 'em
She's trife, make you wanna sip the whole bottle gone
She's like nothin, nothing's like her, it's not fair
The way she's actin makes me not care

[Verbal Kent]
Okay, check it out, I gotta calm down and face this broad
Before I pull a David Aames and get my face blown off
Smokin trees in the vanilla skyline, our eyes blinded
Don't know the fine line between livin and dyin
'til she's tried and give you a judge, she's a beautiful seductress
'til you get the invoice, nothing's free, pay for crushes
Await the crutches, expect the clouds to gain weight and crush us
Expect buildings to collapse and touch us
Because of discussions that happened between rich folks
That bitch let money rule the world without a second thought
Split the cigar, let's smoke the weed and free to grow too
I don't wanna have to say I told you so don't believe me though
Yeah it's a wonder that I feel like speakin helps us at all
Cause she's behind me with a shotgun, panties, and bra
Lookin at me like "Shut the fuck up kid!"
Go ahead and put your hands up
Give me respect when I demand some

[Chorus]</pre>
