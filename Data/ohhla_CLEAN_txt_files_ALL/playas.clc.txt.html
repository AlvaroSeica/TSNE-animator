	[Intro/Chorus - Never]
	(Playas)
	Mack lack justa messed up the game
	(Playas)
	Messed it up for the real playas who gave it the name
	(Playas, ohwoh ohwoh)
	Mack lack justa messed up the game
	(Playas)
	Messed it up for the real playas who gave it the name
	They messed up big

	When the playas live (Playas)
	Double-breast suit, don hats for real
	When the playas live (Playas)
	Don't have to think twice about no meal
	When the playas live (Playas ohwoh ohwoh)
	They gotta get all they can get (Playas ohh ohh)
	and they feel that they livin is real

[Wildstyle]
A playa gotta do his thing to stay raw
so it ain't no stuffin wit me
Gotta get all mine cos it ain't no time
I'm all about that cash, we green
Pick you up and ride out, straight to the honeycomb hide out with freaks
Booty calls from the mall to the hood
when I'm bumpin and hella creepin down the street
Get your hopes up high if you want to
Big money but I'm still not givin in
Can't afford to lose mo' dividends with the game I put my biddin in
My word (my word) might get in your girl, she mine tonight
I play for the Hay and the E&amp;J, gotta dove in the room if she wanna play
She's keyed to the teeth like a tiger beat
Soakin up your mouth when you're tastin meat
Makin big bank, wanna get spanked
Too slick for you punks, won't get ganked
Gon' stay the same, ain't a thang gon' change
Put it down with the crown, don't like caine
Lay back like a mack with the big faced yac
Agree to never lease Q-ball and stack

	[Never]
	(Playas)
	Mack lack justa messed up the game
	(Playas)
	Messed it up for the real playas who gave it the name
	(Playas, ohwoh ohwoh)
	Mack lack justa messed up the game
	(Playas)
	Messed it up for the real playas who gave it the name
	
[Wildstyle]
Comin thick weeded, peep game with the Westside of thangs
Slow motion, keep it coastin, strollin
They rollin for the riches and bidness
Weeded, pickin up money top cos all the bull wop
No show and tell and ???
Yo' bidness, yo' bidness and well, hittin up cos I got my mail
Ain't trippin or flippin at the mouth even though you went down south
and I was out wit'cha lick cash flows
I'm phenomenon for the minute but I gotta pass at last
Lay low, kick back cruisin like cruise control
Out blow by the window in the do'
til the point that it might make you lose control
3-oh-4's slow your roll, gimme that dough you know
It's no joke to brag or boast
It's justice like touchin functions for the future 'fore the past will flow
Don't get mad and go, two to the back, backstabbin, mack lackin
Gotta get it good, get it right in the middle of the West fo' life
to put it down like playas

	[Never]
	When the playas live (Playas)
	Double-breast suit, don hats for real
	When the playas live (Playas)
	Don't have to think twice about no meal
	When the playas live (Playas ohwoh ohwoh)
	They gotta get all they can get (Playas ohh ohh)
	and they feel that they livin is real

	When the playas live (Playas)
	Double-breast suit, don hats for real
	When the playas live (Playas)
	Don't have to think twice about no meal
	When the playas live (Playas ohwoh ohwoh)
	They gotta get all they can get (Playas ohh ohh)
	and they feel that yo' livin is real

Lay back, hickey phat, something about squaring up tonight
Ain't no time to be a mack lack is on
Gettin it on, if you're not runnin everything is alright
Me, a playa gotta eat baby, money hungry appetite
You hear a beep beep, it's a freak gettin her peon
Choosin blinkin lights, you wanna creep creep
OOOH I'm humpin in, she's just my type of skee geek
Seekin for a thousand grams, hit it, now she's so high
I can't deal with that pimp disease so she got sprung and couldn't stop
I guess she didn't have enough, of that kilo that she bumrushed
Can't think about it, something gotta cotton pick
Be slick, get rich and feed the need
Make speed, express, no stress, how you gon' pimp it greedy?
Let's rodeo, I'm a brother with cashflow so what's your mind?
Follow me, in no time we gon' ride the sign, that's how the playas live

[Wildstyle]
Pimpin ain't easy, nowadays gotta play your cards right
When you're a roller mackin them freaks
stay down and spit your game tight
For ?????? hit em up, I know it's time to slow flight
but I just can't get enough, it's about that loot on all night

[Coldhard]
You know I had to get my looter mayn, either way this plan go
I been in this hustlin and this strugglin game ever since '84
Always wanted to have some ever since I was a shorty
And I wadn't no punk when it came to get straight nasty and naughty
Cos I knew how to get my money, ???? wasn't no dummy
Sit back, sketch a map, write a list of a homey
The two's, the one's, that I, select
to come up, get what I'm gonna get and jet, never break a sweat
and won't regret, I'm with no checks, ain't no disrespect
Cos I wanna flex, I'm ???? go flip me your legs
Hell bidness bidness, gotta eat, entitled to three women
While shipping me by the feet, and if you judge then judge my thang

	[Never]
	When the playas live (Playas)

	When the playas live (Playas ohwoh ohwoh)
	They gotta get all they can get (Playas ohh ohh)
	and they feel that they livin is real</pre>
