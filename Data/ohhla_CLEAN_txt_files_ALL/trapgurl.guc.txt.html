{?} throwed up, every room a flat screen
Took her income tax and I flipped it to a whole thing

Keep her lookin good cause the money's not a option
Nix it, grits it, shit is my trap shit
Number one draft pick, good at the mouth shit
Trap bitch, bad bitch, nuttin like my last bitch
If they ever meet, then that bitch gon' get her ass kicked
