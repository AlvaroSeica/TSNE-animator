S-I-N
I would give my life for you 
You mean the world to me 
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooooooooh !
You know I love you 
And I wanna be together we can run away
 
Uh huh 
C'mon
Yeah, yeah
 
It's NB Ridaz 
Same klick new title 

Just me and you 
Just you and me 
Will you run away with me? 

The day I wrote these words for you I cried
Could of died that day
A happy and complete man 
Cuz in the palm of my hands 
Everything I dreamed for and more
And you know that I'm down for yours forever-in life 
The reason why I made you my wife
Is because you see me for me 
The real me 
And love me unconditionally
And even with them circumstances that I had
You still gave me a chance 
And that's why 
I live and breathe for you and the kids
And you give 
Me more then what this thing can ever give me
And now my life is satisfied and complete
Visions all coming true 
Yeah, of me and you
Placing rings on each others finger saying I do 
You stuck with me through my thick and the thin
To go back and live life all over again 
Nah, this is my destiny 
It was worth the agony 
To get the ecstasy

Chorus:
We can run away and spend some time 
I'll always be the one right by your side 
Tell the whole world you belong to me 
You are my everything
Ooooh
I wanna run away with you

I never ever met a shorty that was quite like you 
Even though when even though it was wrong 
I felt in love with you 
Now we sit here
Not really knowing what to do  
But I'm sure that you know 
I give the world for you 
If I could run away with you 
I wouldn't even think twice (Uh-hu) 
I promise girl I put it all on the line 
I know forever seems to be a long time 
But that's what I'm seeing
When I look into your eyes
And it don't matter what your friends might say
Cuz I know deep inside, you feel the same way
You can tell me what you want
But I can read your mind
So quit lying to your-self and put your hand in mine 
I get excited every time you come close 
And being right here with you is what I love the most 
So anytime you're feeling lonely inside 
We can run away together, leave this world behind, uh

Chorus

Waking up in the morning and your still not there
Can we run away and escape somewhere 
Missing your soft touch 
Your lips next to mine 
Holding up your hands as you look in my eyes
What must of happen to the love we both felt inside
Emotions were strong 
And the feeling was right 
Now we don't speak anymore
You went your own way
If that's what loves about 
Then I was mislead 
Go ahead and take your time 
If that's what you need 
My love for you is forever 
My heart for you bleeds 
Things happen for a reason 
So I ask myself 
Should I be strong? 
And wait or move on to someone else
I know you still love me 
I can feel it inside 
You always kept it real
No games, no lies
If you ever feeling lonely 
Fell the need to get away
Call me up I'll be there together we'll runaway (girl)
