[Intro: Ishod]
It's true, things ain't what they used to be 
Every day life changes
But you need to know, that I still got love for you
(I still got love) Yeaaah...

[No Malice]
Now when I say brother, I'm talkin the same mother
We still blood when the fans no longer love us
I had to break apart to honor who is above us
But you should take heart in knowin I got you covered
I see you in the public, now how can I not love it?
We fought for this life and now you makin something of it
Well check it little brother, the one thing I've discovered
Them riches be where lust in, count 'em all as rubbish
Cause it's more than evident that these things are perishing
Without them, I still see the greatness that Terrence is

[Chorus: Ishod] (No Malice)
It's true, things ain't what they used to be (Oh yeah..)
Every day life changes (Re-Up Gang forever!) 
But you need to know (Liva, I see you), that I still got love for you
(Can't forget Sandman!)
And everything we see (I mean..), ain't what it seems to be (...we done toured the WORLD!)
Every day life changes
But you need to know (Gotta love it!) that I still got love for you (I know I do)

[No Malice]
Check it... 
and all is well with Pharrell -- Star Trak forever
Promotion's from the Lord so it was all for the better
The money never made us so how could the money break us?
It's only God who says He would never forsake us
What could ever shake us? And even to this day
Our etiquette way tighter than any Dame and Jay
Trust me when I say that my love for you runs deep
I could never be fakin, kiss yo' momma on her cheek
Anyone can see what you have added to my life
So I must say thanks again bro, this is only right~!

[Chorus: Ishod] (No Malice)
It's true (And yo...), things ain't what they used to be (..remember all them trips we used to take to D.C.? )
Every day life changes (..to New York..) 
But you need to know, that I still got love for you
(...or how 'bout all them countless hours we spent at Chad's crib, while his parents cussed us out.. into Godly)
And everything we see (I mean..), ain't what it seems to be (We had a lot of fun back then!)
Every day life changes (Too bad all good things must come to an end)
But you need to know (But luckily for us...) that I still got love for you (...+No one Ever Really Dies+)
(...to saved, that is)

[No Malice]
For every heart broken, and every lie spoken
Try not to blame yourself, girl, my game was truly potent
My verses you were quoting while reclinin in my coupe
Then I went, scooped up your friend, how much lower could ones do?
Thinkin it was cute, all the games we were playin in
Please forgive that little boy, he hadn't any sense
I was dead wrong - Jesus, come to my defense!
And have mercy upon my soul when I approach that bench
This pain is too immense, guess it's time I faced my karma
So reluctantly I pray you meet your knight in shining armor

[Chorus: Ishod] (No Malice)
It's true, things ain't what they used to be (We all make mistakes..)
Every day life changes (..But if you could...) 
But you need to know (..I mean, if you would..), that I still got love for you
(...Allow me to take the blame)
And everything we see (I was a rapper), ain't what it seems to be (I did what rappers do)
Every day life changes (But whether you forgive me or not...)
But you need to know (..I'm sorry) that I still got love for you </pre>
