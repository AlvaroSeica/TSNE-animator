[Intro: Yukon Black]
This aint what you hear everyday on the radio, Times up
They Say, They Say, They Say, Yo

[Yukon Black]
I done spoke through these pro tools a thousand times
If I aint sold you on this then I aint makin a dime
But we can bet that rope that somebody gone love me
They say I'm wack or ta, And I should rap about stuff you can relate to
I stay true like sides, Take you outside what you hear everyday on the radio
Suckas try to play me, But they brain too slow
See I'm socially equal to the people that I speak to
My closets aint stuck with evesol, Matter fact they damn near see through
Shit, My pockets aint on it, They coughin cause they got too much room to breach you

[Chorus: Yukon Black, (Begga Ooh)]
We aint rockin the rhymes, They say
We aint got it no more, They say
Nigga your time is up, They say
What yall doin it for, They say
We aint got no rhymes, (You aint got rhymes) They say
We aint rockin no more, (You aint rockin no more) They say
Nigga your time is up, (Huh Huh Huh) They say
What yall doin it for, They say

[Begga Ooh]
One for the treble (treble), Two for the bass (bass)
I deal with mad issues regardless of the race
Channel live on your broadcast, Tune me in
In a place I shine whatever room we in
Whatever mood he in, He a dope lyricist
Absolutely one folk that's really livin this
Ha, Pumps out the music veins like medic wards
I'm a slave to the sequence of livin up poor
Drivin an Accord low key in the E-X
When I get bored it's S-E then X
Rated, Rate me, They think that I lost it
But not when I'm broke no money in a pocket
Uhh, On a new topic it's key when I lock it
Turnin them heads like a wrench in a socket
Fuck it, I'm out to get the caution signs
Spilled out on this track, Don't bust your behind

[Chorus w/o Begga Ooh]

[Yukon Black]
All about eighty-seven, That's the era I'm reppin
Put the one in front of that, That's what I do to attract the weapon
Tongue lashed out, It got your ear drum stressin
Had a flock of blind-deaf-dumb broads undressin
And yes indeed, Yes sir, You see surgical sole cuts
Musical medicinal ba-dietary and poetry
Your feet feel better when the beat meet the lecture
Professor Black, But you can call me Yukon Jack
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack
They say, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, They say
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

[Chorus 2X w/o Begga Ooh]

[Outro: Begga Ooh]
We aint rock the rhymes, Say, Got it no more, Say
Uh huh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Ha ha ha, They got, Rockin it no more, Rockin it
Time is up, Time is up, What yall doin it for
We aint rockin the rhymes, Not no more
We aint got enough rockin result, Time is up
What yall doin it for, Rockin the rhyme-rhyme-rhyme
Rockin no more-more, We aint, Time is up-up-up
Rockin the rhyme, Ha ah ha</pre>
