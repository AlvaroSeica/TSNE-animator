[Phonte]
Flying high, you and me still flying high
Chasing you like fireflies, you can be my guiding light
(Let's ride)

[Chorus]
Baby don't look back cause we can't turn around
Baby don't look back cause we can't turn around

[Phonte]
By your side, yes I will be by your side
None to fear and none to hide, you can be my guiding light
Every word, that you feel you cannot share
Keeps us from a brighter day, a happiness beyond compare
Beyond compare (Compare to yooou~!)

[Chorus 2] {2X}
Baby don't look back cause we can't turn around
Girl you better make it good to me
Baby don't look back cause we can't turn around
(Ooh, around, roooound)

[Phonte]
Now I know, love's a different animal
Do we ever start to grow?
Or is is something all for show? All for show?

[Outro: Gwen Bunn] {8X}
If you won't stop, then I won't stop
Baby let's make a way
If you hold on, I won't let go
Cause baby you saved the day</pre>
