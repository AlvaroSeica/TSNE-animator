[Chorus]
Yo it's the inner city blues goin' through my headphones
Starin' at space and runnin through the red zone
Feel like rhymin', freestylin'
Going back in the time when brothers wasn't wildin'
But nowadays it's a brand new tactic
Brothers be gettin fly and traveling galactic, uh
Better beam down to earth
I'm blowing up with mine first

[Verse One]
When I was young I used to roll with thugs that sold drugs
Exporting high-caliber weapon transportin'
It was very important to the niggas on the block
That you knew how to get down when it was time to rock
Came like we was raised on a farm
I mean, niggas be on they way to school gettin' clicked on
In '81 
Niggas used to get thrown up in a suplex 
And robbed for their summer youth checks, what
Other stick-up kids lookin' like 'Who's next?'
Runnin' out, knockin' niggas out in two steps 
Or three steps
Deceps ran sprintin'
Everyday was a fight like it was San Quinton
Niggas hidden about who been snitchin' to the dean
At 3 o'clock his wig got split upon the scene
I guess a buck 50 just ain't good enough no more
Kids be playin' tag with the four four mag
Little bad motherfuckas need to stay in school
Shorty I went the same route so I'm droppin the jewel
Mad niggas gettin' killed over nothin'
Straight squeezin' off on motherfuckas
When you hit they nerve button

[Chorus]
Yo it's the inner city blues goin' through my headphones
Starin' at space an' runnin through the red zone
Feel like rhymin', freestylin'
Going back in the time when brothers wasn't wildin'
But nowadays it's a brand new tactic
Brothers be gettin fly and traveling galactic, uh
Better beam down to earth, I'm blowing up with mine first

[Verse Two]
Yo, I heard this chick say she wanted a +Ruffneck+
Niggas tryin ta be ruffnecks but, yo motherfuck that
Tryin' ta act wild and get a nigga killed
Hook him up to the respirator and put him on tilt, word
Bad boys move in silence
Was said bad boys caught two with a silencer to his head, uh
Some niggas lucky enough to do it and live through it
I had a chance but I chose not to pursue it
Most of the rough niggas I know be like dead or locked up
When they come home my niggas look blown
Swollen up, but the times is changed
So ya better get hip and get a grip mad quick nigga
One to three is no joke
Five to ten is even worse
25 years, I'll be cryin' steel tears
Trying to send a bomb letter to the judge
Special delivery nigga, you made a lifetime grudge, uh
I make a shank out a spoon or a light fixture
Stay alert and try to keep out of the mixture
I never smoke cigarettes but I get 'em so I could sell 'em
Here comes static, somebody better tell 'em (what)
My ward gear be like five or six layers
With books tied to me and I'ma 7:30 playa
This ain't the time to be franchise neckin'
The trouble arises quicker than the national deficit

[Chorus]
Yo it's the inner city blues goin' through my headphones
Starin' at space an' runnin through the red zone
Feel like rhymin', freestylin'
Going back in the time when brothers wasn't wildin'
But nowadays it's a brand new tactic
Brothers be gettin fly and traveling galactic, uh
Better beam down to earth, I'm blowing up with mine first</pre>
