Song:   Freak What You Feel

[Scarub]
It happens quicker than it seems
Visions are turned to dreams
Dreams no longer gleam, or glare
The dreamer prepares for
The 'ever after' or, the final chapter
Few leave with laughter
Left on the face 
This space is usually filled with feelings
Leaving the body warped
Contorted, morbid, consorted, carried and buried
The life that was once adorn forever mourned
Freak what you feel
Before it's too late to fill your plate
And don't ever say you were never warned
It's like too many fakes
There life was no feeling
No purpose, or passion
What's your reason for living is what I'm asking
And once you find the answer to your meaning
Your reason starts gleaming
Beaming brighter than first love
Higher than a first dove
That leads the sun into the sky
Pushing it's first shove of light
Bringing forth day
Freak what you feel in each and every way
No matter what they say, no matter what they say
Freak what you feel

[Tiombe Lockheart]
Unprohibited, Always spirited, Do what I'm feeling, I won't ????, I might 
fall cause, I'm dreaming, I'm just a dreamer, It's all believing, It's all on 
purpose, It's just for leaving

[Scarub]
I like chillin with my friends, laughing til it hurts
Seeing pretty ladies in the summer wearing skirts
Sandals and tank tops, t-shirts and flip flops
Listening to hip hop
Feeling it in my rib cage when the bass drops
Just some of the things that make me feel alive
Make you forget about that 9 to 5
Or at least change the vibe while your in it
The way puppets with no strings fall out of proportion
I seen the same thing happen to people when their passion ain't scorchin
When only cash equals their fortune
Or no longer having a torch in 'em
And adrenalines at a minimum
While the pendulums moving towards them
It's like their running out of time
Or time's not working for them
Nothing there to assure them that their problems they can endure them
Crossing their arms too fast
Cutting all them out
All possibilities of hugging a fortune
The outcome: a case of attitude overashadowing advancement
Self destruction, they like the sloppy way of living
Don't let that all up in your function
No quitting now we in too deep baby, we gotta fight
Mistakes are made but through it all we still be shining bright
We only humans, but as humans we can make it tight
Freak what you feel, and what you don't feel we goin' make it right

Freak what you feel, freak, freak, freak what you feel
freak, freak, freak what you feel
freak, freak, freak what you feel
Cuz when it's too late, it's too late...

[Tiombe Lockheart]
Clearly time to do, Live your life so, Make those mistakes and, There only 
lessons, It's all lessons, Another level, It's all on purpose, It's just 
living, It's just being, It's just being...</pre>
