[Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Mmmmm..mmhhmm (hahaha)
This one right here.. (yeah)
Goes out to my niggas on the street bubblin (come on)
My shorties, in the strip club bubblin
(You know how we get this) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I make moves moves like a chess game, don't care what you think
Don't care what you hold, don't care what you own
Your style's old, you fold, like cash
Crumple like hash, and dangerous like the Ave.
in Brolic like a Nav'
I pick tracks to stab, while y'all fools get nabbed
Guzzle Remi, Vinnie Chinnie smash many,
and any of you cats is silly-willies
Take your chilly trinkets, snatch your silly hoes
They low in our bungaloes, and fools wish-wash
and slip, hit ya'll, splish splash
That's how I sound in your girls ass
Do damage with a pen like Nicky in "Casino", you know how we go
Ain't no fuckin our amigos
Go 'head and hate, speculate, do what you like
But we still get to poppin when we grippin the mic
Properly light, like little mami lovin the pipe
I'm bangin it right, even though she swingin with dykes

[Chorus - Tahir]
Who keeps it bubblin, bubblin, bubblin
You know, I know, that we gon' keep shit bubblin
Bubblin, bubblin, bubblin
You know, I know, that we gon' keep shit bubblin
Bubblin, bubblin, bubblin
You know, I know, that we gon' keep shit bubblin
Bubblin, bubblin, bubblin
You know, I know, that we gon' keep shit bubblin
Bubblin, bubblin, bubblin

[Shabaam]
This cracklin like pop-rocks in your wife mouth, lights out
Like Common came to pay you a visit
For you niggas in the Expedition I asked your mission
You fools can't roll when two wheels are missin
I'm unstopable, boo-boo, check me out
And you chickens on the sidelines, close ya mouth
Y'all with doubts, watch how I FLIP the game
FLIP my slang, kinda like I flip the 'caine
Or flip the whip in the rain, when I flicker the flame
Then light the L, damage sent me outta control
All you cats talkin trash you can see me den (see me den)
See the nines went 3D, your life could end
All the war like Wesley, get wrapped up in
In the back of the house, get trapped up in
S-Double bubble words, like trays of crack
It's a small thing 'til you tally up the stack

[Chorus - Tahir]

[Shabaam]
Duke, you soup like lentils, I twist and bend you
Recommend you, go back to them niggas that sent you
I'm insulted, you niggas wanna test my gangsta
Like Sahdeeq won't rock, like Sahdeeq straight prankster
But I got nothin to prove, I got nothin to lose
This is Ill Street Blues stupid, take that snooze
I'm S-Double, motherfuckers as live as it gets
I'll splash ya clique, got ya chick exposin her tits
Get a spoon and a bowl, cuz I'm feedin you shit
So pay homage, put a bag on ya head cuz you straight garbage
It's a wrap, I'll snatch you breath like an asthma
Collapse you lungs when words get slung like G-Pecks
I mean that, ain't no hidden message between that
Guillotine raps, for them fake-ass tough cats
We get dough, spend dough, never bluff and pretend do'
No procrastinatin, keeps it perkalatin like..

[Chorus - Tahir]</pre>
