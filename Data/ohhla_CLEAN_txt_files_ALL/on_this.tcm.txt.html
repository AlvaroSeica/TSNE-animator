[J.R.]
It's Christmas Eve, you're making plans for the evening
Can't wait to see the gifts that you'll be receiving
Call up your friends and family to share the moment
Cause after all it wouldn't be Christmas without them here
You've hung the lights, tied the bows, and poured the eggnog
Even put the finishing touches on the tree
What's left to do, but to give a toast for all of your blessings
Numb to the very purpose of this day

[Chorus]
May this Christmas, be the day, you find his love
May this Christmas, be the day, you find what you're searching for

[J.R.]
So holidays really don't mean that much to you anymore
For one reason or another
Was it the loss of a child, or a friend, or your family
That made this season so hard to bear?
You've tried everything to get yourself in the mood
From TV shows to the very clothes you wear
Not taking time to see the needs of another
Or the One who gave himself for you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son
That on that day was the beginning of new life for me and you

[J.R.]
So when we have come to the knowledge of the Truth
And our hearts and eyes are fixed on Jesus
The Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world
Then we'll really know the true meaning of Christmas

[Chorus]
May this Christmas, be a day, a day of great joy!
May this Christmas, remind us of God's great Love

Emmanuel, the Lamb of God
Jesus (x3)
Laid down your life for the sins of the world</pre>
