Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Element of the surprise
Such a spectacular thing I cannot, lie
So many things people wanna limit you to be
I show you a glimmer inside the spectrum of the wizard
Well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
The nigga didn't come out they mouth [?], so sad
When I smash, wipe the smirk off their face, my bad
Who bad, I am, my dad raised one hell of a man
[?] livin', I had the [?] in advance
Still don't feel appreciated and not by my own fam
All good, I'll be tucked away in them shadows
Workin' in sweats, solve the riddle and soon I'm ready for battle
Move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
We unified by the dark and middle fingers in the air
Come on who gon' go half on a zone
Oh, thought I would be done off the coke, no
Let me tell you something ho
Been said everything that shine ain't gold
Been skatin' on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
Been that nigga sittin' in hell in fresh ass clothes
I know what it feels like to have a broken nose
And ain't nobody hit you in it
It's really cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
That time you thought I was finished no I just experimented
And it helped me adjust and be OK, with being demented
By the way nigga these cars ain't rented, I give a fuck who sees
So I don't bother rollin' tinted look who the fuck it be
That's candy Cleveland niggie I stay reppin' my city bitch
Been smokin no jokin', Cudder's had that itch
So I scratch, so please no more speculation 'bout that
Burn baby, burn
Truthfully and noted
I'm back so please no more speculation 'bout that
Burn baby, burn
Truthfully and noted
I'm back
Niggas think I'm livin' life paranoid
(Mothafuck that, man)
Aw, they got me twisted, they don't know that boy
(Mothafuck that, man)
I'm just gettin busy killin' it, I'm gettin' busy
(Mothafuck that, man)
I just wanna watch it burn, baby, burn
Niggas think I'm livin' life paranoid
(Mothafuck that, man)
Aw, they got me twisted, they don't know that boy
(Mothafuck that, man)
I'm just gettin busy killin' it, I'm gettin' busy
(Mothafuck that, man)
Now it's time to watch 'em burn baby, burn</pre>
