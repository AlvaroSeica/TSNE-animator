[Big L]
I'm large on the Streets
Large on the Streets
Large on the Streets

[Vado]
Vado!

[Big L]
I'm large on the Streets
Large on the Streets
And every time I touch Mics

[Vado]
Veedon!

[Big L]
And Every time I touch Mics

[Vado]
UN!

[Big L]
And Every time I touch Mics
And Every time I
And Every time I touch Mics

[Vado]
Harlem!

[Big L]
I'm Large on the Street Scene!
I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene.
Cause I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene.
Every time I touch Mics I'm large on the street scene.

[Vado]
Heads start bobbin like who's this?
Vado that dude spits sharper than steak knives from Ruth Chris
You ordurbs get toothpicks, I aim to shoot shit
Sweep up ya whole block, No Broomsticks.
Yeah, when I touch Mics, I come right, They like son nice
Get thrown like hung niks, Every bars a gun fight
Get one strike, cope like tiger woods, Fuck with too much white
(haaaaa) Proud Dream, My Style Mean Wish I was here to see the next thing they crown king
It's that swag that uptown bring, 4 pound swing, you be down before the sound DING!
You ask me, you sound weak, you not a threat.
Like Artest I don't stand too far from the best.
Carhartt and Vest, Nah I ain't the hardest yet.
There's a few Artist left, word for them... God Bless!

[Big L]
And Every time I touch Mics
And Every time I touch Mics
And Every time I
And Every time I touch Mics
I'm Large on the Street Scene!
I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene.
Cause I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene.
Every time I touch Mics I'm large on the street scene.

[Vado]
Live performance hit the stage no encore
A wild cat that could ball like he John Wall
Get Crossed, Big Cross wear it like john paul
No Pope peel dope got it inside walls
I copp ounces from the hill
Uptown and down the block from where malcolm was killed
Street Built, could tell the album is real
Numbers could go on heads, that's just how a nigga feel
Tight if you want, you could fight or get jumped
If I was in hell I'll have satan lighting ya blunt
Got a Variety, if it ain't the tre, it might be the pump
Nigga hole for all his kids, throw wife in the trunk
Fuck Life, I fear nothing. You nice? lemme hear somethin
I'm like a Mack Truck you a deer runnin, Straight roadkill.
I don't care buzzin, My Name in the air buzzin
Cops floodin the block like the man coming.

[Big L]
And Every time I touch Mics
And Every time I touch Mics
And Every time I
And Every time I touch Mics
I'm Large on the Street Scene!
I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene.
Cause I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene.
Every time I touch Mics I'm large on the street scene.

[Vado]
So nowaday bag is a dime
A bad Bitch that's fine
Got work on the Strip you grind
See a nigga you say Slime!
Locked up you got time
Coke you got lines
Deal you got signed!
Stop it 5 you all talk singles we call short
And popped off means we all for it
Cotton Club thugs ya all soft
Blocks that's boardwalks
Shipping you up top that's up North!
One time means fucked off
Or say it before you hang up the phone
Dap ya man then walk off
A hot cars a toy
A cop car's the boys
We call nike shocks the boinks
Loose change is coins
Gun Play shot thangs with noise
Say you wearin bang bang, means ya chain is moist
You like the way I deliver it
I talk for harlem, I will never stop kicking it .

VADO!

And Every time I touch Mics
And Every time I touch Mics
And Every time I
And Every time I touch Mics
I'm Large on the Street Scene!
I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene.
Cause I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene.
Every time I touch Mics I'm large on the street scene</pre>
