[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Uh-huh... yeah
West Brighton, uh-huh, yeah

[Solomon Childs]
My little sister wants Christian Diorre
These faggots just sent my little cousin to war
If poverty's real, I ain't crying for nothing
My baby's gotta eat, I ain't dying for nothing
And can blow a cathedral down, like George Benson
And I know I just got here but I'm collecting my pension
And I decided, to be the sacrifice
But the sacrifice got heat
And ain't affraid, we gon' haress a hanging
Somebody inform the first stage
Double homicide, still mix haze
With the so-so reefer, you should see the gun game
Something pretty like Aaliyah
Strong, like Fat Joe at the Fever
Momma said she had dreams
That they'll be shootouts at my photo shoots
Standing tall, saluting on top of my roofs
Staten Island stand up, Valentine, federal niggaz
And ain't no half stepping, my eyes burn the fire
And gonna get this money til my life retire
Snitch ass niggaz in the hood
You might as well be wearing a wire
Menace II Society Part II, this the soundtrack
Vengeance for the murder of my cousin King
Fuck a rap deal, we spending money like it's holiday time
Two open cases and supreme court
The Theodore, we wan't all of New York
Nigga, nigga, nigga...

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, Staten Island, huh
Now Born, Killa Hill
Stapletilz, Body Brighton
Jungle Nilz, Southshore
My motion picture...</pre>
