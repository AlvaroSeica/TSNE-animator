Yeah!

Alright!

Hey listen I don't mean to seem rude
I just speak truth
Can I, get this whole scene through with some key moves
See, older kids told me I was a weak youth
Now it's just a bitterness I eat fruit
Even with my sweet tooth
Nice to meet you
And it's ironic how you never heard of us you were too busy wearing sheep suits
We don't need proof
To walk far in these shoes
We're unorthodox, let your mind 3-2
Yeah
Talk about lyrics well I got millions
Most of which I think you wont admit
Are fucking brilliant!
And if you wanna hate then tell me
That line goes straight to the pussies, no Brazilians
Let me tell 'em
We're bringing something new to the table
Don't lot anyone who knows me
I refuse to be nasal
Yeah!
And there are bitches who aren't usually faithful
I keep looking to the people that I use to rate like please listen!

[Chorus]
Cause you need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you at all
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you at all
You need me

You don't have to ask twice
Yeah
For the past 5 years
Had a hard time in bars fights
They'd laugh like
You ain't a rapper bruv, you aren't hype
No I'm sick like cancer but that ain't my fucking star sign
And I can't lie
Do not perceive me as the rapper type
Ain't bringin' swagger, but some fact an I analyse
The fact I leave an arena hanging like the stalactites
More for your money that's asda price
No I don't hassle I don't hide
Your acting like most guys
Who are having the pros hide
To gather they're own vibes
So if you wanna tell me change styles that's fine
Those that mind, don't matter, those that matter don't mind
That's the message were sending
Insult was never intended
People took pleasure inventing
But
I remember the telling
The path was never in question
Were artists at work
And I color don't need you
America spelling

[Chorus]
Cause you need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you at all
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you
You need me man I don't need you at all
You need me man I don't neeeeed yooooooou!</pre>
