[Candyman]
Stepped into the party at a half past nine
Last thing on my mind
was tryin to wine and dine another heiny, shoot
(You could just knock those boots)
What you see is what you get
And baby let me tell you, you ain't seen nothin yet
Sweat drips off the tip of my eyebrow
I wanna dip your hips (right about now)
How about a drink, do you think we could spend a little time?
Your place or mine?
You're so fine, do you mind
a little kiss on the hand (from the Candyman!)
And as we dance, by any chance may I have your number?
Sometimes I wonder
What it would be like, spendin the night, foolin around
So let me see your nightgown

[Chorus]
Nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh
Night-gowwwwwwwn
Nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh nahh
Night-gowwwwwwwn

[Candyman]
A sexy little girl like you needs a man like me
Cause I can't stand to see
A pretty young thing like you just goin to waste
Right in front of my face
What irritates me the most is when we're close
you just boast and brag
Out all the men you had no one comes close
But it always starts like that
And once they get it, forget it, the minute they're done they step
out of my pad and all I'm left with is a bad rep
Her mouth was runnin I had nothin comin to me
She kept askin me
Do you wanna watch TV or do you wanna see the town?
I wanna see your nightgown~!

[Chorus]

[Candyman]
Crept into the bedroom, I was feelin kind of faint
(Maybe it was somethin you ate)
That was my complaint and she bought it like it was on sale
And it never fails
It was gettin late ao I figured that she wouldn't even bother me
But she treated me properly
Took the shoes from off of my feet
Pulled down the sheets, I could feel the heat
(from the fireplace) burnin in the living room
Knowin that she would give in soon
Much to my surprise when I tried, she provided the leadway
This is no he say or she say
When I say to you it's on
I mean like Donkey Kong 'til the break of dawn
Didn't take long 'til I heard that familiar sound
(Ahh) I finally saw her nightgown

[Chorus]</pre>
