[Rapper Big Pooh]
I'm a money getter, a pound flipper
Yen, euro, yuan - they all differ
I get dough, I stack bread
Old school, keep a lil' where I lay my head
Straight bills, no change (none)
Flip currencies when it's time to board planes
Safe landing when it's tuck behind the old frame
Pickin up more money at the baggage claims

[Chorus]
I'm gettin it, you gettin it?
Foreign exchange, I'ma keep spendin it
Got cars same color as the Raiders
Independent nigga makin money like the majors
("Cause I'm a money getter, I'm-I'm a money getter"
