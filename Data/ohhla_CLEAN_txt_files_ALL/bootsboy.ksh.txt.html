Boots and boys, ohh
I think it's time that I mention
I've got myself an obsession
For the smell, for the touch
Keep that scruff lookin rough
I know I've got myself a habit
But I gotta have it NOW
I don't care where, work it out
Let me break it down
I try it on... I take it off
So what you got? Somethin 'bout

[Chorus]
Boots and boys (boots and boys)
They bring me so much joy (bring me joy)
I gotta say I wear 'em both so pretty as I walk in the city
Watch out, boots and boys (give me boots and boys)

[Ke$ha]
(Give me boots and... boy-toys, oh!)
I'm keepin quite the collection
Take nothin less than perfection
Cowboy boots, cowboy boys
Mmmm~! Oh the joy!
My men drop beats like a bomb
Excuse me n-n-now huh?
Wind me up, spin me 'round
Oh, lookie what I found (ooh!)

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and boys)
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and boys)
Crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and...)
(Boy-toys! Oh, ohh...)

[Ke$ha]
Hey, hey, hey - hey hey, what'cha looking at?
Hey, hey, hey - hey hey, somethin you can't have
Yeah yeah yeah yeah - they've got me lookin rad
... You feelin that?

[Chorus] - repeat 2X with "somethin bout" between
