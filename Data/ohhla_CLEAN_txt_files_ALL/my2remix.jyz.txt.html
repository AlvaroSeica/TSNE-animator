[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homie I'ma make back
Hey! Can you believe that? (whoooooa)
You gotta see it, hey!
I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music

[Jay-Z]
It smell like summertime to me! {"What is this?"}
First one to cop, I'm the Maybach muse
First one in the coupe, I'm on my third six-deuce
White guts, black Benz
I call that bitch Affirmative Action
Oreo, the Obama
Curtains drawn, they can't see me, Osama
Cashmere throws, that's a splash of class
S.C. initials on the Tiffany glass
I guess on the initial Maybach
I was way too official, they ain't call Jay back
I'm just a bully, I apologize
and if you would've asked, I probably would've lied
Huh, this better, no pressure
as my mind reclines on white leathers
I think back to my first Maybach
Baby blue sides, I called her my Similac
Six-deuce every time, I never had the Heinz
Fifty-seven can't catch up to mines
No diss to Ricky, this his song
But everybody know this the shit that I been on
No fives, no four-point-ohs
So no partitions, a no-no for Hov' {"Sweet"}
I'm a just a top-drawer nigga
Penthouse every time, I'm a top-floor nigga
As I drift off further
Chauffeur serves the city, observers
Oohs and ahhs, they know who's inside
Though I never touch the wheel, I won't lose my drive
Oohs and ahhs, they know who's inside
On the factory shoes, I won't lose my stride

[Chorus: T-Pain]</pre>
