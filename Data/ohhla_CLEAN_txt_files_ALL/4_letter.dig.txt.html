4 Letter Word [4x]

[Verse 1]
You make me wanna sing to you (ahh ohh)
Yeah, its the little things you do for me, homie, lover friend
I can spend my life with you (ahh ohh)
Yeah, girl we ain't gotta thing to lose so, lets go, and runaway

[Chorus]
Its you and me never gotta worry cuz we always got each other
like the moon, to the sea girl you got me feeling your waves
You're my 4 letter word, 4 letter word, my 4 letter word, 4 letter word
you're my 4 letter word, 4 letter word, my 4 letter word, 4 letter word, 4 letter 4 letter word
You can be anywhere in the world but your here with me
Cuz you're my 4 letter word, 4 letter word and I'm your 4 letter word (woah)

[Verse 2]
To be loved to be loved what a feeling its a drug. Ima addicted to ya hugs, and kisses and ya ahh
No matter who's around I show affection, walk you on the inside of the side walk for protection
I need a moment, to take it all in feel so surreal don't it
When you need me call me I will never leave you lonely and I think thats it corny to just call you my angel
You my Aaliyah this letter is almost 4 pages
See my parents and your parents don't agree they think our love is temporary cuz we only teens but
Not too many get it right on the first try and I'm feeling so right for the first time

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I don't wanna hear a love song cuz I live it
Every moments memorable we'll never forget it
Love the way you pucker up your lips when I peck it
When you get this message I'll be right here when you check it
My heart, my mind, my soul, my time its all for you let me say it one more time
My heart, my mind, my soul, my time its all for you underscore bottom line

You're my 4 letter word, 4 letter word, my 4 letter word, 4 letter word [4x]
Love, you're my 4 letter word, love</pre>
