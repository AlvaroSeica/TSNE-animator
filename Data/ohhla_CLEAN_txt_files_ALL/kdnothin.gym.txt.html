[Travie McCoy]
Ch-ch-children put on your angry faces, mothers hide your daughters
I've been busy burnin bridges, hovering over troubled waters
City folk'll never understand the country mouse's jokes
They'd rather sit and watch the lemmings lead each other to the slaughter
This is me thanking you dearly; sincerely, from the bottom
of what's left of my misery magnet, guess I've been too busy being stagnant
And if I ever steer you wrong, grab the wheel and jerk it left
I'm only human but admit it - I'm such a beautiful mess

[Chorus]
With the Mad Hatter cackle and the Cheshire cat smile
Put the jabberwock's cadaver with derelict juvenile
The futures got Travie engraved on a name plate that I copped on Fulton
while the passers poppin pills somewhere on the other side of Brooklyn
So this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (SO I'M SAYING HELLO)
And now I'm screaming hello (AND NOW I'M SCREAMING HELLO - IS ANYBODY OUT THERE?)
Now this is me in front of the class naked
This reoccurring nightmare never ending
So I'm saying hello (SO I'M SAYING HELLO)
And now I'm screaming hello AND NOW I'M SCREAMING HELLO - CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?)

[Travie McCoy]
Baby let's ride the steel horse until it stops galloping
And let the +Nerds+ get +Revenge+ on these stars with Lamar's javelin
Here Betty, put this Vader mask on, and take me to the dark side
bumpin your favorite song
And I promise I'll stand still until the feelin is gone
And if I slip and bust it's cause we must be doin it wrong; oh by the way
If you happen to meet the asshole that wrote the manual
Tell him Large Marge sent me to merk him and make it casual

[Chorus]

[Travie McCoy]
So I'm leaving the grocery store the other day
Probably one of the hardest things I have to do with my anxiety and all
And a woman walks up to me ("Hey, aren't you Travie?")
She doesn't say hello, she just grabs me
And I can feel my heart beating harder and harder and harder
("I'm from upstate New York too")
And I can feel the skin on my chest getting tighter and tighter
Until I just, until I just - SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST, AHHH!!

[Chorus]</pre>
