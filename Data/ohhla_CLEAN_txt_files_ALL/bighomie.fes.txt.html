[Fes Taylor]
Aiyo, my big brother, was King's brother
Used to be Herb and Big's brother
I remember had Port Richmond locked in a smash
Everything from Harrison to the Ave.
And life was good, you brought the 8-50 right to the hood
Was a little nigga, corner rolling dice in the hood
Advice I understood, you ain't bring me it
Owned alotta shit, really it was for my own good
Jamie showed me a brick, and I ain't been the same since
Told me to go and get it, how you think they rich
My pop's brother, was DJ brother
Used to be Donald and LeRoy brother
So Less and Lawaun, how could it not be the same
And roll chains, like Reeda's my last name
For Anthony, Amire, Zion and little Ness
How could I ever care a little less
You know, S my brother, cuz L.I.S. my brother
So Roslyn and Sheila both like the same mother
Still we grew up with gangstas as role models
Helping my pops up the stairs, he drunk the whole bottle
It's no lotto, so it looks like
Two 4 War, my only hope for tomorrow
So I be a big brother to the block
Try to school the little homey's life bigger than the block</pre>
