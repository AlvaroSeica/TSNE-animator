Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (hmm-mmm)
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (hmm-mmm)

Okay, wake up in the morning to the clear blue sky
Turn up the music when I hop in the ride
The windows down let the whole world see
Cain't nobody rock it like the little ol' me

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
Hm, I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up

I got my Chucks and my Dickies and I put it on black
Bangin Sinatra in a flat Cadillac
My old lady leanin out the whole window
Everybody lookin when we walk in slow

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
Hm, I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up

Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now)
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now)
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now), whoa-oh-oh-ohh 

Wait, one for the money and a-two for the show
but three to be a legend even if I'm po'
I ain't chasin nothin, you gon' have to catch me
and if you wanna taste, you gon' have to pay a fee

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
Hm, I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up

Call my mama, in-laws and my little scarecrows
When they hear my record, well they all hit the floor
Baby strike a pose, c'mon up in the front row
The homies in the back tip their hats real low (Wassup?)

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
Hm, I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up

Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now)
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now)
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now), whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now)

Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now)
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (A liitle louder)
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh (A little louder), whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Alright now)

Okay, c'mon everybody won't you clap your hands?
White folks, do it on time if you can
Sounds good, now here's the plan
Let's all sing together like we're in the same band

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
Hm, I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
Hm, I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
Hm, I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up!

Now, we're gonna reach another whole new level
Grabbin the light, on the run from the devil 
(WATCH OUT!) Been downtown for too long
I feel the sun risin all up in my bones

I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout to blow up
Hm, I'm the bomb and I'm 'bout, to blow up!

Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now)
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now)
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now), whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now)

Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (All around the world)
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh (Everybody sing it now)
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh (A little louder), whoa-oh-oh-ohh (A little louder)

Kill 'em all! {*music stops*}</pre>
