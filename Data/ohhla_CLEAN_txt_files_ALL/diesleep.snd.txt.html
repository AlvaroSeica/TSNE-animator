Typed by: adimumalika@excite.com

I'm not the type of cat to just freeze up rhymin' 
In any situation, scenario, locale or whatever 
If I did lose my grip, my clutch, my timin' on a written 
I'd flip to freestyle and keep it together 
Cohesive as black skin transitioning from legs to an ass 
It all just fits 
Got clever wits, intelligence, panache, plenty rhythm 
So forget what next man submits 
It's irrelevant at this moment 
No pity for my opponent 
If I was another mc, I'd be content just listenin' to me 
Until my lab work's done
Or I got a presentation that'll impress everyone 
Be competent before you're competitive 
Or particularly confident or I'ma make your feelings ache 
Just be a fan or dap me like I'm your man 
As I feather your fancy though I'm like far from lightweight 
My state of mind is tight, great, solid and all 
Mouth lined with fat shit without collagen y'all 
My state of residence? TX, but don't be apalled 
Not all southsiders are about followin', y'all 
I'm the biggest trendsetter since D.O. or Ron C. 
Another Texan emcee with my talent's beyond me 
Talent alone won't make you blow as we all know 
But I will make a way and you'll listen once you know 
In some cases you know as soon as you listen 
So you can be with me from the beginning 
Or follow, it's your decision 
A message for all and it ain't that deep 
You can acknowledge what you're witnessing 
Or die in your sleep 

(chorus) 
You 'bout to die in your sleep 
Engulfed in scripted flames 
My spin on the truth of mc'in 
Like king james 
Give or take the background 
Jesse owens ran 10.2 
But fast is 10-flat now 
Things change 
I'ma redraw what you know so far 
Down south's 'bout to be up south 
There you are 

Announcin', never mispronouncin' (bavu) 
Spit from a fountainhead 
Insurmountable visions spread 
Bled into rhyme books 
Written at a literary speed you could read if you had to 
Inner eye to pad to audio equipment's equivalent 
Scribble it down, distribute it and benefit 
If you put some work into it 
Do shows from big-time to intimate 
Float on penmanship 
And then hear what I wrote get spins 
Websites get hit and scoop writes good shit 
It's either a win or a wish, which one 
Let's leave an impression, just stick to your guns 
Self-defense weapons givin' fake ones the runs 
Belittled dolittles oughta just twiddle they thumbs 
Or suck 'em, or somethin' 
Activity that plentifully does the trick 
If you bring four guys, four skins circumsized 
That remedy only your ears have to sip 
Practical, no joke, no hoax, no disguise 
All aboard black enterprise, let's set sail 
Salute those who came before me 
But it's time for me 
I'll be damn if any of my new shit is half-corny 
Which foretells retail sales with details it entails 
Impales 'em to skewered entrails, plenty's at stake 
Sincerely, Bavu Blakes, wordsmith 

(chorus) 

I hate when people sleep on me 
Do I look like a sealy posturepedic? 
Did you see me with a glass pipe 
Gettin' much worse than weeded 
Well otherwise why you lookin' at me like I'm on that dope? 
I am and it's the rhymes I wrote 
So pass me your papers if you can't be blunt 
Or you front, preoccupied with what the whole world wants 
You can't please everbody 
I know your mama said it at least once 
But you igged her, now nobody digs ya 
Style-shoppin' ain't synonymous with diverse 
And that's all the airtime ya getting in my verse 
I'm nice beyond denial therefore commercially viable 
Thus a new definition of hardcore 
For the masses to catch on to 
In just a few, your obits will be through 
If you slept on Voo 
This is a message to all and it ain't that deep 
You can acknowledge what you're witnessing 
or die in your sleep 
(chorus) </pre>
