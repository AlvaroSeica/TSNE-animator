[Chorus 4X: Iron Mic w/ ad-libs]
Ring the alarm, cuz Iron Mic is coming, whoa, 12 Rounds, nigga
Ring the alarm, cuz ya'll ain't fucking with Iron, no way

[Iron Mic]
Yo, I smoke haze, hydro, nothing but chronic
My flow is sickening, I need antibiotic
I chase fast dollars, should of took my ass to college
But I chose the street, where I learned mack and tech knowledge
Shit, you sell crack to make the prophet
We got the game locked, ya'll niggas need to stop it
Nigga, that's right, that's it, nigga, Iron Mic, 12 Rounds</pre>
