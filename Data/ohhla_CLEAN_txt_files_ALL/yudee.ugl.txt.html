Awwwww yeah!
Party people all over the world
I wanna ask you a question (say what)
Can I ask you the question? (uh-huh)
I'm gonna ask you the question

[Chorus]
Tell me! I wanna know (what?) {*3X*}
I wanna know (whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?)
Tell me, who you came to see (U Deeeeeeeeee)
I wanna know, who you came to see (U Deeeeeeeeee)
Tell me, who you came to see (U Deeeeeeeeee)
I wanna know, who you came to see (U Deeeeeeeeee)

[Verse One]
This is it - here we go - gonna start the show
Hurry up - get a spot down in the front row
U.D.'s on the scene tonight, so hold tight
Cause we're gonna set it off - when I hope on the mic
My name is Dizzy Dustin comin fresh from the West coast
I don't mean to boast, but I'm wanted like the ten most
And I'm Andy, C-double-oh-P-E-R
We are, in the place to be - yup~!
Four after tour, payin dues galore
We're a classic group - not the soup du jour
They come and the go, but we're just the opposite
Been around years and we won't stop rockin it
U, undeniably, D, death-defyingly dope
Since we got down back in ninety-three
You can come and see - when we move in your direction
Then I can ask you the question

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
This goes out to all the hip-hoppers
Checkin for the real thing, not the imposters
All dressed up - don't do that here
This ain't a fashion show or movie premiere
Say what? It's known that we blow spots
While others just fall like Keystone cops
So, call your friends and rendezvous
We're on the move, headin to a club near you
One town to the next - better check MapQuest
Lookin for the gig with my pass, all access
Comin through the back door - look at the crowd
Jumpin on stage and it all starts now
(U.D.!!) Makin music how it's meant to be
Doin what we wanna we don't care about the industry
And you can come and see - when we move in your direction
Then I can ask you the question

[Chorus]
