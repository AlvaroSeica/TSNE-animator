Oh, tonight is such a special night

So nice chilling with my baby, me and my lady slowly working things out
Glad that you are that lady

Hold you in my arms rocking side to side
Loving you only the perfect bride
Stars in the heavens parade syncronized
I see something in your eyes

[Verse 2: Beres Hammond]
