[Jackie Harris]
I've got the power! (2X)
Hea yeah

[Turbo B]
Like the crack of the whip, I Snap attack
Front to back, in this thing called rap
Dingin like a cymbal, rhyme thimble, on the heavenly level
Bang the bass, turn up the tremble
Radical mind, day and night all the time
7:14, wise divine
Maniac brainiac, winnin the game
I'm the lyrical Jesse Jammes

Quality I possess, and say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the mic-rophone, that I am holdin
Copy written lyrics, so they can't be stolen
If they all Snap, don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice don't see
So peace, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that

[Jackie Harris]
I've got the power! (4X)

[Turbo B]
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kinda hectic (8X)

[Jackie Harris]
I've got the power! (4X)

[Turbo B]
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kinda hectic (4X)

[Turbo B]
Quality I possess, and say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the mic-rophone, that I am holdin
Copy written lyrics, so they can't be stolen
If they all Snap, don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice don't see
So peace, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that

[Jackie Harris]
I've got the power! (to end)</pre>
