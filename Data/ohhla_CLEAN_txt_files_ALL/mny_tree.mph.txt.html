[Intro] {X5}
The roots of evil, never grew me a tree (the money tree)

[Solomon Klepto]
Cash has got me cursed, the parcel clearly showing I can tell
I'll sacrifice years committed a criminal, mind south
The financially weak comprise my clientele
Filthy price when counting dirty dosh, I'll see youse in hell
Grease stain my skin so I refrain from economic sin
Feeling like a piece of a lost puzzle, not fitting in
Gap between rich and poor, money, why don't they print more?
Invest in poverty instead of in weapons of war
What is it all for? I debate in my mental forum
The answer appears in Latin, "novus ordo seclorum"
It sickens me in disgust, root of evil we lust
And faithfully worship so which god do you trust?
Satanus controlling us, the dollar is our idol
Same symbol destroyed my family and made me suicidal
I'm living on one ounce of freedom, two ounces of average hustle
When they put a price on oxygen I swear to god Muphin I'm killing my... self

[Chorus: Muph, Solomon Klepto]
The roots of evil, never grew me a tree
	Imagine picking dollars like leaves, living financially free
But it couldn't buy my love of Hip Hop, I work the hardest
	Regardless, no cash sprouts from my harvest
The money don't make my world go round
	It fluctuates up and down
Money talks, I've got no voice to make a sound
	Content with what I have, that's how I afford to live
So burn the fantasy of a money tree
	But something's gotta give

[Muph]
I suppose it's what I want and I guess it's what I need
But when the need becomes a want, it begins to turn to greed
It helps to provide shelter, clothes and a regular feed
But it's not all and everything, every cent ever spent
Never meant more than what was obtained
Bought both the release and the strain
The beast that drains the average but uplifts the rich
It's not life but money who is the real bitch
It's assumed that without it that nothing can be consumed
Promotes driven actions, which can drive you to moral doom
You see that room? It's consumed by the plastic
Pretty soon this world will become more tragic
And status is based on how much you earn
Nine to five, get in line and wait your turn
And if I earn your interest
will I gain from these intimate tracks that I finished?
Should it be a hobby or a business?
I dunno, but with God as my witness
I get more pay from the positive spray when I spit this

[Chorus]</pre>
