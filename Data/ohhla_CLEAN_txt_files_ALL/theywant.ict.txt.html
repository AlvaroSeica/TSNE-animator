[Intro: Ice-T]
Damn, this shit is going down again
These motherfuckers want me back in, Fuck them!
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
I gotta get the Ski Mask
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Get out the H-K!
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
And Fuck them!
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man

[Ice-T]
Niggaz talking crazy cause they say
That I killed one of their motherfuckers
Sucker ass busters, did or did not
I got more drama with them niggaz from the other side
Called my nigga Rich in his ride!

[Big Rich]
Fuck! them niggaz
I got a truck full of 38s and bullet shields
Ice, we can send these niggaz all to Hell
I never liked them niggaz from the Get Go
Used to break them in craps and fuck all their motherfucking whores

[Ice-T]
Made another car hit, thirty Killers on the hip
Ready to rock, packing Magnums and Glocks
Man connections; Who trips? is the question
Niggaz on the way to play, in a laser ray

[Big Rich]
Nigga you got two strikes and I got two strikes
We can't afford to leave no fucking witness tonight
But if this is what they want, it's like Christmas to me
It's been a long time since the Big Rich caught a body

[Ice-T]
Fuck it! I like the way you think my man
I've packed twenty motherfuckers in the Astrovan
Will pass your crib about 12:30 - there'll be
Nigga be ready to roll, I know you heard me!

[Big Rich]
Nigga it's on, so don't trip, I'm down
I got the Sawed Off Shotie, and I'm ready to clown
Blast the nigga in the face, kill his fucking whore
Ice, you done did this kind of shit with me before!

[Chrous: Ice-T]
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
They want me back in!
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Niggaz want me back in!
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
They want me back in!
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Damn!

[Ice-T]
Niggaz wanna ill, well my niggaz get iller
Street full of hardcore stone-face Killers
One Love! my nigga Big Rich puffs bud
I don't get high, I wanna see some niggaz die!

[Big Rich]
Yo, some niggaz hit the corner with the lights on fights
The shit don't look nothing nice
But if these niggaz wanna roll in my hood, yo, then fuck it
Break out the hard World, boys flow the fucking Bucket

[Ice-T]
Niggaz pulled out, my crew was ready
We turned the fire, rocked the punks steady
When they shoot and stop, car looked like confetti
Went my ass home, jumped back in the bed G

[Big Rich]
Yo, why in the fuck they wanna fuck with us?
When they know my posse is crazy and they down to bust
Big Rich take no shit from these buster-ass tricks
Check a punk ass nigga like I check a bitch

[Ice-T]
I got no love for no nigga flipping, tripping on my fam
Got damn, I make L.A. hot as Vietnam
But ill niggaz should be left alone
Please excuse me, while I rest my dome!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
They want me back in
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Niggaz want me back in
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
They want me back in
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Word up, our niggaz is strapped, ready for war! --------&gt; Method Man
Why? - niggaz want me back in?</pre>
