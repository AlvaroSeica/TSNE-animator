[Chorus]
For once in my life I ain't gonna trip about
Having you always hanging around
Trying to act like own me in every way
I'm a do me so you can roll
Your own way
I ain't even gonna worry about
The time of night and
I'm a be at the mall buying the things I like
Do my hair do my nails
Get my purse and go out
Cause tonight
I'm a rule the world boy

I'm sick and tired of it all
All my ladies with babies
Who sick and tired of it all
I've gotten to the point
I'm sick and tired of it all

Cause tonight is about me don't even call me

I use to think it was ok
Being at home alone
Watching the kids without a
Carro to roam
And well trying to handle business
Be a good house wife
Cleaning up your mess
Gave you control of my life and
I couldn't even talk on the phone
With out you trippin
Who you talking to
Des cansado for no reason
And now

I wanna let you know I'm
Tired of it all trying to understand
I'm sick and tired of it all

[Chorus]
For once in my life I ain't gonna trip about
Having you always hanging around
Trying to act like own me in every way
I'm a do me so you can roll
Your own way
I ain't even gonna worry about
The time of night and
I'm a be at the mall buying the things I like
Do my hair do my nails
Get my purse and go out
Cause tonight
I'm a rule the world boy

Can be sure if I fall in love
I'll be strong
I gotta take care of my self
So that nobody ever brakes me down again
I'm just so so tired of it

It's about damn time that I
Did something for me so when
I look into the mirro
Beauty is all that I see
You had my self-esteem down
Always crossing the line

So I'm a bout to raise it up
Have me a really good time

I just wanna kick back
Without having to ask and
With the homegirls by my side
Baby in having a blast
I wanna do things my way for once
And make it happen
Got me so sick and tired of you
So get to walking

[Chorus]
For once in my life I ain't gonna trip about
Having you always hanging around
Trying to act like own me in every way
I'm a do me so you can roll
Your own way
I ain't even gonna worry about
The time of night and
I'm a be at the mall buying the things I like
Do my hair do my nails
Get my purse and go out
Cause tonight
I'm a rule the world boy

I now in joy living
My life without you inside
I'm a rule the world boy
I wanna let you know that
I'm doing just fine
I'm a rule the world boy
[REPEAT]

[Chorus]
For once in my life I ain't gonna trip about
Having you always hanging around
Trying to act like own me in every way
I'm a do me so you can roll
Your own way
I ain't even gonna worry about
The time of night and
I'm a be at the mall buying the things I like
Do my hair do my nails
Get my purse and go out
Cause tonight

I'm a rule the world boy
I'm a rule the world boy
I'm a rule the world boy
I'm a rule the world boy
I'm a rule the world boy</pre>
