Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: King Just]
I've been doing this
Vet status, salute
New rookies just started
I'm comfortable with it, with mines
Welcome to the comfort zone

[Chorus: King Just]
I, got you, all in, my comfort zone
You, don't know, how to, respond back home
I, know why, I'm still, in this game
Cuz things'll never be the same, until they scream my name
I don't care who you be, nigga, KJ, I don't care who you be
Nigga, KJ, I don't care who you be, you gon' see me in the industry, talk to me

[King Just]
Aaaow! We gon' bang like heavy metal
The next level, hot kettle, rhyme rebel devil
Push pedal, bass, treble, series of elbow
Send you 90210's back to Melrose
Homos, while MC's'll get these
Coocoo for Coco Puffs, we palm tree
Rap nominees, still strap my bird with keys
Cuz I can't depend on the industry to feed me
See me, when you wanna, I don't hide, I ride
In the back of the 2 train, or in front of the 5
I survived the ordeal with a full course meal
Now I need a superwoman for this man of steel
Bananas peel, and so do wigs do, I ain't nice
I'm tired of living in igloos, stick who?
Park Hill, we evict you, after we done dissed you
And dismissed you, nigga, we official
Down to the bone gristle, why you think they made the KJ scud missile
I got here to, get you
Sick like the flu, I'm rapping til I'm blue
And sound better than you in whatever that you do

[Chorus]</pre>
