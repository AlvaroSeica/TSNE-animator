Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
And the road gets
Harder with flow spits
Cause we represent the Kansas City, MO shit
Double doses
Tech Kalikosis
But ran into a duo that's ferocious
Some of the best two
Kill you no rescue
They say that you gotta spit hot 16s before you step through
And they say everybody
Nigga even Tech do
Now we gotta explain our journey to the Ces Cru...

[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
I'm on a pilgrimage to the rhyme mecca
Because I'm Tecca
And this mind left ya
Down at the bottom because N9ne's betta
And if swines ever find the quest to try and test the cleverness
They in a mess bind and yes I sever decay em and define pressure
Imma spit it for
Big wars and not a critic whore
Hit ignore
I got acidic core
In this war your not a winner pause
Wanna pla-ay every da-ay
Sta-ay for the wa-ay I spra-ay sa-ay
You gotta pa-ay thats ya-ay and ay-ay
Bumblebee tuna
GRR
Dont be smelling like it if your under me rumors
Will begin about you from hugry pumas
Hoping wising prayin when your gonna be sooner
When I dead em I get up in the head of the nigga that said it
I'm pickin the lead up then wet em look like a predator, Imma get em n let em pass
Skip the peace it ain't no humble we luna
Moon stricken
Rednecks sayin who them coons rippin
BOOM
Pick em up
Take em off to my land in my van a lotta room
Get in and in
When I catch my flow tryin to wake up your style
But you fucked up like, uh oh
Imma make up for it now

[Hook x2]
It's unfair to be
Such a mother fuckin rarity
Beware that we tear many squares
If he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bear that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nair any spared caring is barely there
It's unfair

[Verse 2 - Krizz Kaliko]
Who are these dudes we never let any of these fools cheat on the rules
Kristopher egotistical narcistic whicha
If they say no then we tellem to get up n move we makin some rules
I heard of these guys, murderous when it comes to scripture
Ubiquitous, and Godemis, they Gods to us
We Gods to them, so we meet right in the middle
Too fat to fry it up and belittle
When its unfair, we got there hands in the air
And you can't even get a show
No one cares that your freestyle so rare
But no body could anybody know
But it's easy for them physical favors
Why yall just spend all your paper
Breezes bend over the table
Tattoos embezzle my label
Drivin n traffic n rhymes them choppers Africanized
We what is happenin to your wife
While your at 9 to 5's
You might as well stop rappin
Cuz its not happenen if I stop laughin
Cuz its to hard to impress just blatant disregard
The four horsemen of course with force to the coarsewin
Your talkin taller when yall gettin the short end

[Hook x2]
It's unfair to be
Such a mother fuckin rarity
Beware that we tear many squares
If he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bear that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nair any spared caring is barely there
It's unfair

[Verse 3 - Godemis (Ces Cru)]
It's unfair to me
Nothing is what it appears to be
Killin off any and everything
Comin to enter somethin that steered to me
If you feelin the fear then flee
Fi fo fee fo where the fuck go
I'm retarded with a clover
I guess you can call it dumb luck
When I'm rappin
Out of habit im adament gettin adam
But I would rather
Hit a madam with a Magnum and split her atoms
Tryna fathom the famon that will deminish the anger
Got a place it at the table, we eatin spinnach with strangers
Sippin Carabou lou
Spillin the sickest shit ever by tellm bout who would of knew
I'm one of two in the crew, with knife in my pocket an one in my shoe
Surrounded by haters so what am I do
Thinkin I gotta devise a gameplan
Get a ticket to kickit with krizz n nina
So I guess I'm headed to STRANGELAND!
And my main man, woulda told me to merkem
Doin the sin indeed
Imma catch a couple more, then I'm formin a human centipede
Pause "Pause"
I'm aware that they hatin, look at the god at this
Who the fuck is fuckin with
Tech, Kali, Ubi and Godemis

[Hook x2]
It's unfair to be
Such a mother fuckin rarity
Beware that we tear many squares
If he dares to be a parody of this clarity
We bear that we share swear we need therapy
Prepare to see nair any spared caring is barely there
It's unfair

[Verse 4 - Ubiquitous (Ces Cru)]
It's unfair to be, doin mother fuckin charity
You can pay a fuckin fair for me
You really there? Ain't nothin there for me
Move carefully
I swear to be, light as a parakeet
High as a cherokee
In my rhyme I spoke like jeremy
Feel my fire, my smoke, my kerosene
We we don't want no drama
We we don't want no trouble
We we can keep it peacefull
If yall yall can keep it humble
I, I really don't know what he come fo
But his name is the same as a gun yo
Strangeland is a place that I seen in a dream
Since I was runnin around in my umbro
And you heard it direct from my mouth piece
Techs got it me out, an found me
Turn out we the perfect strangers
Lary appleton and balky
I was out east
When techs came in , when tech sayin what is about to be
Before you fuck me, on the go kno that everybody around lookin out fo me
Now that we got that in the air
I can feel the change in the atmosphere
A crew been livin in limbo
Apprently all this rappin has trapped us here
And after years they hearin we lost inside the dream
Not necessarily
I won't let this rap thing bury me
Imma let these bat wings carry me

[Backwards]
It's unfair to be
Such a mother fuckin rarity
Beware that we tear many squares
If he dares to be a parody of this clarity</pre>
