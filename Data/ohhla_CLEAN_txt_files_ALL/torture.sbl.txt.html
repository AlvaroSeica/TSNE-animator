Ha-Hoooo

[Billy Danze]
Yeah, mic check, turn my fucking mic up
Yo this hip hop to the fullest M.O.P (Yeah)
Screwball Whatcha'll want huh?

I'm not very conversational
So whenever I'm facing you
With my intensions is erasing you
I'm lacing you, splatter your whole shit
We interview the whole clique
Bitch Brooklyn's out of control with "Torture"

[Kamakaze KL]
Live nigga rap get clapped nonchalantly
spray paint your body with hot ones
From M-1's, AK's, Macks, Teks and Uzzies
M.O.P to Screw B Brooknam to QB

[Chorus]
Bridging the gap
Kill'em with clap
Slugs fill'em with that
Drugs dealing with gats " is Torture"
Cross your hands is more realer than that
Fuck around it will cost you
Boss Man is Torture

[Lil Fame]
This is this is torture
Knock your head right the fuck up off ya
Guns N Roses huh
Whole spit huh
Don't spit huh
Fourth fifth is "Torture"

[Blaq Poet]
Nigggas getting shot up
Niggaz getting sliced up
Aint nothing nice what what
From the QB borough to the borough of Brooklyn
Uptown Manhattan Dirty Bronx and Staten
Niggaz stay gun packing and stupid acting
9's and Mack 10's loaded up for action "Torture"
I don't give a fuck getting Henny up
Kicking that thug shit yall niggaz can't fuck with

[Chorus]

[Billy Danze]
My shit is ghetto average
Fuck living laverish
Fuck me around put it down on some savage shit
I ain't having it when ever my automatic spit
Tragic hit thou shall have thee cabbage split "Torture"

[Kyron]
Man I'll smack the black off ya, choke you white out
Kyron totin the arm now its night out
My life's a clef note cleverly written by skilled hand
The way I rhyme sling, and rhyme design to kill a man "Torture"

[Hostyle]
you can cop a few Slugs by the hand full
put you in a land field, animal,
show you how to handle steel
travel fields and battle
lay him on his face In the gravel
stay up in your place in the shadow "torture"

[Lil Fame]
Check what the gun do
Put a pot hole in you one, two
Pop slugs and hot thugs wit rock mugs
Gun smokes steam from his clothes when he got plugged yo'

Chorus 2X's

Salute... M.O.P.
Salute... Screwball
