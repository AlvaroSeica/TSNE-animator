[Trina]
Look, I ain't got nothin to say to you
I can't even believe you
You know what?  I'm too fly for this shit
You playin yourself

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin you, at 3 o'clock in the mornin
I can't take this no more - no no no!
Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin you, at 3 o'clock in the mornin
I ain't tryin to hear it - not this time

[Trina]
Look nigga what you think this is?
You treatin me like a random chick?
You done forgot, who introduced you to rocks
and poppin all that Crist' and shit
Who let you hit it from the back any way that you liked
And any debts, I can pay the price
I thought I was a chick you would make yo' wife (damn)
And now a bitch can't even stay the night? (you whack)
I can't even look in your face without wantin to slap you
Damn I thank God I ain't get that tattoo
You better thank God I ain't have the strap boo
You ain't even worth lettin Trick get at you
Matter of fact, Trick get at dude
I'm convinced I ain't got shit to ask you
And tell that triflin bitch she can have you
I ain't lookin at you no more, I'm lookin past you

[Chorus]

[Trina]
When my girl came through with the news
All I did was think about me and you like "Damn"
What a chick gotta do to get with a real nigga
that know how to stay true like man (man)
Know one quarter to 8, you better hop on the bus or a cab
I shed so many tears, can't believe how many years
"The Baddest Bitch" put up with yo' dusty ass (yeah)
Now you know that I'm the Queen of Miami
All that loud talkin lyin save that shit for your mammy
Sounds like "blah, blah blah, blah bla blah-bla"
I'm like uh-huh (uh-huh) okay (okay)
Whassup (whassup) SHUT UP

[Chorus]

[Kelly Rowland]
Now all my ladies say... if you feel the same...
If you can't take no more say... no no no (no no no)
No no nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

[Chorus] first half w/ ad libs

[Kelly Rowland]
That's why I'm grabbin up my jewels, grabbin up my purse
I'll be back, for all my shoes and purses, watch me fly
In the 745 while I'm ridin out
Cause I ain't tryin to hear it, not this time</pre>
