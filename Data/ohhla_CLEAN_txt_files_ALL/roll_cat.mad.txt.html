Typed by: DaKillaRodriguez@hotmail.com

You niggaz is crazy...You better be rollin' up over there quan

I represent for all my left back niggaz
Cadillac, to left rack niggaz who is gettin' it
Representin' It, Reinventin' it
Wit big money schemes and dreams of
Diplomatin' it, and settin' it
I see ya'll coppin' it, I'm still rentin' it
I'm still borowin' if you're still lendin' it
Pussy in the club, can't wait to start bendin' it
And this ???, Can't wait to start Spendin' it
I'm signed now, refined now, I'm still on the train
But I pay my son's Mom on time now
No more fastforward, It's just rewind now
No more six packs, It's cheese and wine now
Crazy Cat, My gold gat, Hoes - I like 'em fat
Shows I like to pack screamin' like Michael Jack
Whether it's rolled or in a pipe, I'm lightin' that
Whether it's guns or fists son, we fightin' back
Word, The Madd Rapper, For the 9-9 Boy
This How We Do

I say Ho's to the front, and Niggaz to the back
Role up a blunt, and load up your gat
If you gettin' doe, Then hold up a stack
If you wanna blow, Then role with the cat</pre>
