[Intro]
Hey Marcus...
Uh, what's up?
Um, there's somethin I wanted to ask you...
Uh, what is it?
Will you do me a favor?
Oh no no no!

[Chorus]
Marcus?
What?
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
Oh hell no!
Will you watch sponge bob with him
And teach him how to make a crabby patty?
Oh hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Will you still be down to get nasty?
Oh hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throws elbows!
Please?
No!
Please?
NO!

[Hopsin]
Throw me the mic
I got a flow to recite
You got a baby by a nigga that you don't even like
A broke nigga who thuggish
Always be talkin rubbish
Steady be causin ruckus
All because you were sluttish
Jesus, I can't believe this, freak shit!
That's the same mother fucker that you had cheated on me with!
I knew this would happen without a question
But you said
"I never have sex without protection"
Bitch please
You left me flowin down shits creek
You sex driven like a big freak
Plus our relationship has been breached
You took a big leap
And rumor has it you sucked his dick then kissed me
And now I'm suppose to be the father and the mental guide
Like sure I'll take care of the little guy
Shit, you ain't puttin me through the stress
I put your baby in a pillow case and beat it to death

[Chorus]
Marcus?
What?
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
Oh hell no!
Will you watch sponge bob with him
And teach him how to make a crabby patty?
Oh hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Will you still be down to get nasty?
Oh hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throws elbows!
Please?
No!
Please?
NO!

[Hopsin]
I'm far from a fuckin life saver
Not your friendly neighbor
But yet you called me durin your labor
It's not my issue, take me off the menu
I'm not the one who put the motherfucker in you
I'm not a mean guy
I hate to sound that foul
But I don't give a fuck about that child
You damn right
See You chose him, then he fucked you
Tag your it
Too bad his dick didn't have any insurance
You knew that he was just a lame nigga prior to it
Now your ass hittin me up thinkin I would do it
Hopin we gonna spark it off like some lighter fluid
That's kinda stupid
Face the facts bitch your life is ruined
Don't be callin me like "My life's a crazy blur
Rashad don't take care of the baby and makes me hurt
I wish me and you could go back to the way we were"
Shit we can
Just get rid of the baby first

[Chorus]
Marcus?
What?
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
Oh hell no!
Will you watch sponge bob with him
And teach him how to make a crabby patty?
Oh hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Will you still be down to get nasty?
Oh hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throws elbows!
Please?
No!
Please?
NO!

[Bridge]
Now I won't be your baby's daddy
I'm not the one
But you can still give me some head
And maybe swallow some cum
And if you want it, then I can deliver quite clean
But don't ever send the baby to find me

[Hopsin]
Yo
Do you remember when I told you that I would love you forever
And broke up with my girlfriend Heather
Kicked her to the curb
And got with you
Thinkin you were better
But found out you were a heart shredder
Yeah, I felt pretty stupid after that
Became the nigga that my crew was laughin at
I was foolish, that's a fact
So this is karma
You've been on my shit list
So ha ha ha ha
That's what you get bitch

[Chorus]
Marcus?
What?
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
Oh hell no!
Will you watch sponge bob with him
And teach him how to make a crabby patty?
Oh hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Will you still be down to get nasty?
Oh hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throws elbows!
Please?
No!
Please?
NO!

Hey that's life
You fuck me over
He fucked you
You got pregnant
Now your fucked
You had me
You had me, that's the funny think about it
And you blew it
Ha ha ha</pre>
