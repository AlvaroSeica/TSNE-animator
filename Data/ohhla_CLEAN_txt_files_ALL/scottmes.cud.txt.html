[Kid Cudi]
Whaddup? How's everyone doing?
You are now in the world I'm ruining
Take a minute to adjust to the wonderous
clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
I promise you some Generation Next shit
Speak for the silent who are left with
parallel levels in a dark dark place
Tricked all you niggaz to a dark dark fate
And guided you all with a smile upon my face
As the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage rock mountains from above
Money doesn't move me except in the literal
G4 flights now we're off to Australia
I want to see more of the world
These are more than just words, these are facts from a winner

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
This, is, a, journey, into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to youuuuu
We can meet on the other side, on the other side, ayyy
This, is, a, journey, into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to youuuuu
And we can meet on the other side, on the other side

[Kid Cudi]
Whaddup? How's everyone feeling?
I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wonderous
clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will paint the yin and yang for ya
And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnys
Upgraded, faded aided to the T
Work hard makin sure I don't become a memory
Harder to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad cause they stuck where I knew 'em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted, oh ohhh

[Chorus]
