[Lil' Man] (Timbaland)
Bounce!
Get crunk, get crunk, get crunk (Ladies)
Bounce wit' me, bounce wit' me (Fellas, uh, uh)
Get crunk, get crunk, get crunk (Now ladies)
Bounce wit' me, bounce wit' me (Freaky fellas, ah)
Get crunk, get crunk, get crunk (Now ladies)
Bounce wit' me, bounce wit' me (Freaky fellas)
Get crunk, get crunk, get crunk (Freaky, freaky now ladies)
Freaky, freaky, freaky

[Timbaland]
Timbaland never walk in a place
He can't walk out of
Gettin' rude in the place
With a gun in my waist
I just might pop out slugs
With a straight arm
Bullets stomp through your Phat Farm till the animals jump out of
No justifications
While my song question like that Jigga What?
I'm the cause that the thugs gon' fight
In the club so tight, y'all KY'd up
Sometimes I fall, on cars I just hop right up
With the drop top and the top dropped
And your mouth drops like
"WHAT THE {FUCK?}"
Only deal with conjunction chicks
When I'm looking to hit
They give me butt
Now who da man, say Timbaland!

[Static](Lil' Man)
Now off the top, off the top
(We at it again)
From the candy store to the coffee shop
(We at it again)
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
(We at it again)
To the one's at the club
To the people on the floor
(We at it again)
Hit in one mo' gin
Now say off the top, off the top
(We at it again)
From the candy store to the coffee shop
(We at it again)
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
(We at it again)
To the people at the club
To the one's on the floor
(We at it again, at it again)

[Magoo]
Get a fucking watch
Like Brat let me see what to hit for
45 g's what I spit for
Get more money than y'all
Born to ball, go to the mall
Take dat off the rack
Ain't gotta shop at Rack N Sack
I'm a man with a plan to jack
Jack your car, jack your ice
Jack your house, jack your life
Rock ma with a bud tonight
You can have the fame, gimme your loot
All your tools, all your jewels
Mag a fool
I'mma blast till I can't blast
High from penicillin
Not willing to pass out till y'all cash out
With a mask out man I'mma break the bank
Drive through town in an army tank, y'all wanna see me
I'm in Virginia with a house by the lake watching TV in 3D

[Static](Lil' Man)
Now off the top, off the top
(We at it again)
From the candy store to the coffee shop
(We at it again)
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
(We at it again)
To the one's at the club
To the people on the floor
(We at it again)
Hit in one mo' gin
Now say off the top, off the top
(We at it again)
From the candy store to the coffee shop
(We at it again)
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
(We at it again)
To the people at the club
To the one's on the floor
(We at it again, at it again)

[Sebastian]
Listen to me
Sebastian so South that my house got candy doors
Man I'll pop a grown chick to Mandy Moore
Far from a 6-1 clique dropping yours
Slowmo, chrome wheels still riding fourth
Keep chicks stationary like I'm leaving on tour
Palms grip a snub nose I ain't leaving poor
(Whoa! Boy give me more)
See I be dippin' and poppin' the top and
These fools clockin' and blockin'
These ladies lovin' the dough
My youngins lovin' the flow
South boys back on the roll
Ladies get back on the floor
Fellas keep throwin' them bowls
This how a party should go

[Static](Lil' Man)
(In background "Get Crunk! Get Crunk! We At It Again!")
Now off the top, off the top
From the candy store to the coffee shop
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
To the one's at the club
To the people on the floor
Hit in one mo' gin
Now say off the top, off the top
From the candy store to the coffee shop
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
To the people at the club
To the one's on the floor
(We at it again, at it again)

Get crunk, get crunk...
We at it again
Get crunk, get crunk...
We at it again

[Static](Lil' Man)
Now off the top, off the top
From the candy store to the coffee shop
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
To the one's at the club
To the people on the floor
Hit in one mo' gin
Now say off the top, off the top
From the candy store to the coffee shop
To your girl next door, to your boy next door
To the people at the club
To the one's on the floor</pre>
