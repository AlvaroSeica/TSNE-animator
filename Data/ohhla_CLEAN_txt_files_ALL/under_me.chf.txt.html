Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Chief Keef]
Sosa baby
FTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFT
Beep! Beep! Beep!

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
That bitch say that she don't understand me. (Fuck her)
I be flexing
Now my money come in handy
I gotta get this money
Understand me?
100 thous all hundreds understand me (understand me)
Understand me, (understand me)
I gotta get this money
Understand me (understand me)
Understand me
Bitch my name is Sosa
You can call me Sammy

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Everywhere I go I spend a lot of cash
Spend them stacks, spend them stacks and get it back
OTF my niggas they invented that (OTF)
Smoking on this loud, call it the stinky pack (dope)
Count so much money that my fingers cramp
All my niggas Wildin' we don't give a damn (loony)
Ask your main bitch she know who I am (Sosa Baby)
Rob him for his taxes if he's a son of Sam
Who gives a fuck, we don't care bout nothin' Fam!
Got money for a verse, send it through money gram
I'm a drop the top when I buy me a phantom
Kidnap this fuck nigga for some ransom
And if his mouth moving, my gun dance-ON
I pull up in that Porsche, they like "Damn, son!"
All these bitches on me, I won't wife none
I have them bitches runnin', when the pipe come

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Fake ass niggas that's a shit I don't like
Kilogram flow, that's the shit I don't write
All these fucking games, that's the shit I don't play
2 door Murcielago and it's smoke grey
Keep that 50 cal. that bitch come in handy
It will open up a nigga like some candy (BOOM)
In the barrel, look like a Cambell's soup can
Banana clips in the closet like a fruit stand (HAHA)
Talkin 36 O's and I'm the OG
One time I sit and watch a nigga snort a whole key
Muzzle on the Rottweiler, flash no bang
Spent a hundred grand one ring, no chain
Got em pitchin wild 100's, keep it 300
Man that head so good bought her a 300
Understand me
Nigga
Understand me
Understand me
If thuggin was a category
I'd win a Grammy

[Chorus]</pre>
