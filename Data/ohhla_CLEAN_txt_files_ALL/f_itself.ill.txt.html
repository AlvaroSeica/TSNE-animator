(Iron Solomon)
I'm just a regular guy
With a piece of the devil inside
Trouble over treble I am jeckle and hyde
Foot to the peddle with incredible drive
If you blocking my lane you will never survive
My step is in stride
To start wrecking ya pride
Riding the rush the instramental provides
At the end of the line
I'll stare dead in ya eyes
And sense fear,
You ain't ready to die
See I'm an average person
But if you peer past the curtain
In my pupils, then you'll see a savage lurking
Determined to capture the rats and vermin
It's the rapture, snakes in the grass are squirming
Mistakes from the past returning
Embodied in the words of a pastor's sermon
At the funeral pyre while your caskets burning
I don't think this anger management class is working
You bastards learning?
Trying to mask the aggression
Is a thing of the past
You better ask for repentence
The bastard who had been handed a sentence
Just broke out the box and is back with a vengence
I testified that my best had tried to keep it in
But my thoughts are unholy and my speech is sick
It's time my hunger's unleashed again
Supper motherfuckers, let the feast begin

(Illmaculate)
There's nothing to fear to fear but fear itself
But I stare in the mirror and I fear myself
Cuz I know what lies beneath, but I hide behind the beat
Trying to deguise the beast
       x2

(Illmaculate)
I'm a normal man
With morbid torture plans
And forceful hands
That could turn a corpse to sand
I was born to conquer foreign lands
From Portland to the shores of France
This is for the fans
I be on tour to support me and
Want my project in stores to try give me a sporting chance
Of making a living
Every statement is wisdom
Laced to a rhythm
Please save your hateful opinions
"I'm not into making friends"
I'm into raping this business
And taking it's riches
So I'm swing staight for the fences
"No holding back"
The majors are senseless
They take what we give 'em
"We make off sales what they make off the interest"
When I came in the entrance
I started making a shitlist
Cuz the constant raping artist is what made me this ficious
"I'm grateful I'm gifted"
When my brain has a vision
I relay it to the page, and fit it in the space of a sentence
"Engaging defences"
I chugged granades from the trenches
The industry shunned me, I'm just taking my vengence
"You think satan is twisted?"
If you a page on my shitlist
I'll make you beg for repentance
Like rapists in prison
I mean, it's enough that I'm unknown and unsigned
And all I have is one soul and one mind
But all I need is one flow and one rhyme
And one pen, cuz with one stroke I unwind
Sometimes murder's something I'd be happy to do
So when I murder the mic, I imagine it's you
And don't have it confused
That's actually true
It's not to get a reaction from you
"These rappers are fools"
I focus on the tracks that I do
Not fashion and what matches with my hat and my shoes
Put the match to the fuse
I'm just itching to blow man
So get with the program
If you dissing me know that...

(Illmaculate)
There's nothing to fear to fear but fear itself
But I stare in the mirror and I fear myself
Cuz I know what lies beneath, but I hide behind the beat
Trying to deguise the beast
