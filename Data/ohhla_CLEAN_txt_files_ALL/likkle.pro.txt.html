Song:   Likkle Supm Supm
Typed by: anabolikz@wp.pl

You better get you something a little... [a little...]
You better get you something a little... [a little...]

Fresh
Hot   [hot]
Nice  [nice]
Ill   [ill]
Funky [funky]
Futuristic like... PROMOE!
Set it off!

[Chorus]
Now this is just a likkle supm supm
To let you know I got supm comin'
And let you know I'm still up and runnin'
And let you know that the fire still burning

Just a likkle supm supm
For all my ruff riders to bump this summer
All my graff writers who bomb till sun up
And all my ladies let me see you push your hand up
Ram up...

[Promoe]
Dancehall, roll call, stand tall, don't fall
Party people get duttier than Sean Paul
Back that ass up - fuck that, mash up
For all my people that never pull their pants up
Get your shirts off, I'm a kick a verse off
Something out of this world that you ain't never heard so
Organize and harmonize
All my people rise so that we can live nice

[Chorus]
And get just a likkle supm supm
We need a little food and a lots of lovin'
We need a little roof and some pots and oven
We need to tell the truth cus the future's comin'

[Promoe]
Right around the bend I count 9 times out of 10
With the right amount of strength pure righteousness will win this
Stumblin' problem - struggle in Babylon - government's carry on
Crumblin' happenin' front of our eyes like
[RIGHT ABOUT NOW], Bombs over Bagdad
The White House wipe out, this is what the fight's 'bout:
U.S. - no oil - tjicka tjicka - Lights out
People act blind run around with their eyes out
Heads off - screws loose, let's off deuce deuce
Shotgun blast body swell up like cous cous
Love me good hotties from Bollywood
Incredible honeys in edible undies, but is he good?
Easy pops, the ZZ Top of hip hop
Has returned with another hit hot
Till death makin' ladies pull a little closer
Just like they supposed to

[Chorus]
Baby give me just a likkle supm supm
You know we got so many little things in common
You know I love it how you always keep me comin'
Back for more of the sweetest lovin'

[Promoe]
When there's a war going on outside no man is safe from
We can run but we can't hide forever from
George Bush &amp; Tony Blair, IMF, the world bank who's only care
Is to hold this here gold in their
Greedy little hands, somebody tell me why won't they share
&amp; give us just a likkle supm supm
We need some new leaders cus these ones be frontin'

They got hidden agendas ulterior motives
They be spittin' the venom &amp; gettin' the voters
They got devils within' em that's givin' the orders
We need a new beginning and a new world disorder!

[Chorus]
Now this is just a likkle supm supm
To let you know I got supm comin'
And let you know I'm still up and runnin'
And let you know that the fire still burning

Just a likkle supm supm
For all my ruff riders to bump this summer
All my graff writers who bomb till sun up
And all my ladies let me see you push your hand up
Stand up...

Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight [no, no]
Get up, stand up
Can't give up the fight no
Got to keep on fightin'
C'mon!

[Chorus]</pre>
