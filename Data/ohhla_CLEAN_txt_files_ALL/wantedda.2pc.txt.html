[Chorus: 2Pac]
Two of the livest wanted dead or alive (holler if ya hear me) [echos]
Two of the livest wanted dead or alive
Two of the livest wanted dead or alive (holler if ya hear me) [echos]
Two of the livest wanted dead or alive

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Got me up against the fence, back against the wall
Get to acting like a fool, cause ain't no justice for the dogg
Got to take it out on all y'all, better read the papers
all my homies going crazy baby only God could save us.
Got my mind on currency hurry I ain't worried
It's a gangta party, so Bad Boy gettin buried
Snoop Dogg, what they fantasize? (Snoop: fantasize)
When we ride, it's a must adversaries die, every time

[Verse 2: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
I'm so smooth about my paper, check it just how it's done
I'm servin any on a platter Snoop Dogg Coleone
Coleone, now do you know what that mean?
A Teflon Don to this hip-hop game, super supreme
It's like what happen can happen but will it stop
that won't happen I'm feelin good about the mission for jacking
Yo partner, can you feel me?
Why these fools, trying to kill me?
It's so hard to stay focused on my eyes and prize
but if I don't, the Dogg won't survive.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
We balling in my opinion eternal was wild wheel spinning
One simple a minute is represented for five minutes
Two of the livest wanted dead or alive
We riders inverters because we ain't quiet and watch the G's ride
Two of Amerikkaz most, straight out the West Coast
Bow down fool this is Death Row (Snoop: for life)
Been waiten way too long, fresh out the pen, now it's on
C'mon Snoop Dogg, time to bone. (Snoop: ha ha)

[Verse 4:Snoop Doggy Dogg]

Ain't nuttin changed too down to hang I slang a bang with a rhyme
Me and my homey Pac tripping Death Row on knobs
Strong survivor by Eastside of DPG'z
Still creeping bumping through the hood, always involved in the streets
(2Pac: Westside!) It's Doggy Dogg homey, did you forget who I was...

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: 2Pac]

Ain't no love for a real G
You straight cowards all you playa haters kill me
Throw up your hands if you feel me
We gettin dollars, homey holler if you hear me
One time for my comrades doing bad lock down
Fresh out bust the top and bounce drop down
Can you visualize perfection?
Cause every rider in my set labeled a vet best in their profession
Don't hold your breath, stick to Smith and Wessun
Steady study your lessons to keep the crowd guessing

Chorus [2x]

Two of Amerikkaz most, straight out the West Coast...</pre>
