[will.i.am]
Listen up y'all, cause this is it
The beat that I'm bangin' is, de-li-cious

[Fergie]
Fergalicious definition make them boys go loco
They want my treasure so they get their pleasures from my photo
You could see me, you can't squeeze me
I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
I got reasons why I tease 'em
Boys just come and go like seasons

[Hook]
Fergalicious (so delicious)
But, I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious, all that shit is fictitious
I blow kisses (mmmwahh!)
That puts them boys on ROCK, ROCK
And they be lining down the block
just to watch what I got (four, tres, two, uno)

[Chorus]
So delicious - (It's hot, hot)
So delicious - (I put them boys on rock, rock)
So delicious - (They wanna slice of what I got)
Fergalicious - (T-t-t-t-t-taaasty, taaaaa-sty)

[Verse 2]
Fergalicious def-...
Fergalicious def-...
Fergalicious def-...
(def-, def-, def-, def-...)
Fergalicious definition make them boys go crazy
They always claim they know me
Comin' to me call me Stacy (Hey Stacy!)
I'm the F to the E, R
G the I the E; and
can't no other lady put it down like me

[Hook 2]
I'm Fergalicious (so delicious)
My body stay vicious
I be up, in the gym, just working on my fitness
He's my witness (ooooh WHEE!)
I put yo' boy on ROCK, ROCK
And he be lining down the block
just to watch what I got (four, tres, two, uno)

[Chorus]
So delicious (It's hot, hot)
So delicious (I put them boys on rock, rock)
So delicious (they wanna slice of what I got)
Fergalicious (hold hold hold hold hold up, check it out)

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baaaby, if you really want me
Honey get some patience
Maybe then you'll get a taste
I'll be tasty, tasty
I'll be laced with lacey
It's so tasty, taaaasty
It'll make you crazy

[will.i.am]
T, to the A
to the S-T-E-Y, girl you tasty
T, to the A
to the S-T-E-Y, girl you tasty
D, to the E
to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
To the D, to the E
to the, to the, to the..(Hit it Fergie!)

[Fergie]
All the time I turn around brotha's gather 'round
Always looking at me up and down looking at my [*gasp*]
I just wanna say it now I ain't tryin to round up
drama little mama, I don't wanna take your man
And I know I'm comin off just a little bit conceited
and I keep on repeating how the boys wanna eat it
But I'm tryin' to tell, that I can't be treated like clientele
Cause they say she

[Hook 1 &amp; 2]
