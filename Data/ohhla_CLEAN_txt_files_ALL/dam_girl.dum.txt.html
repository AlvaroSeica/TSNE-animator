[Chorus 2X: Dungeon Masta]
Sally told Vicky, and Vicky told Judy
And Judy told Lucy with the big fat booty
Word got back to me, can't believe that she lied
Punched Sally in the face and decked her in the eye

[Dungeon Masta]
Ok, Ezekiel's in the building
I got hard dick for ya'll bitches in the building
Start hustle to fiend bitches, bearing children
Stop living like savages, start caring for ya children
Hey, the slut bitches way out of your league
The only thing you good for is brains and swallowing seeds
Trying to infiltrate the God knowledge, for your mind to fiend
The fume from your rotten womb, make the eyes bleed, whoa
Do me a favor, ma, wash the poo poo
Your bitch is grimey like wet dog poo poo
You're better off hitting papi off up for Yoo-Hoo's
Hold a sperm in your stomach, ma, for hostage, now who you?

[Chorus 2X]

[Buddha Monk]
Damn right ma, I shitted on your outcome
Rather stretched long, made me tickle your gums
Daddy said he's coming home, waiting to get some, but
What daddy don't know, shit, daddy don't know
I can bubble from, vanilla mocha sheets fled with gum
I said, do you like it, baby, she said uh-huh uh-huh
I said, did you finish yet, she said, uh-uh, uh-uh
Bitch, fire in the hole, lay hands 'cross draw
I did the patty duke as I gave the bitch the nuke
And then turned to this bitch and said this bud's for you
Gave her two for the bus ride and five for the sound
She said, can I call you? Shh, sound of the door tight

[Chorus 2X]

[Babyface Fensta]
Peace to all my good women
Respect your man and only give him your loving
Chickens clucking for a fucking, I ain't tricking
That pussy there, I wouldn't dare stick my dick in
Your body could be banging, but your poonani's sash
That just means you'se a sorry piece of ass
I wouldn't smash if I was paid or I needed to get laid
But that girl over there, she got it made
Pretty, sexy, naturally you ain't
Paint the town ugly with your smutty Madonna persona
I would never fuck you
You ain't worthy of the honor, uh

[Chorus 2X]

[Q-Plex]
I met this bitch from the other side
Said she really feel my ride
Said she wanna slip and slide
Magnums in the magnum, so I won't bust inside, legs divided
Ride or wide it, if you gon' give me neck, bitch
You got to glide with it, don't use your teeth with it
Hoe, I'm gon' spaz, miss, instead
She was a surgeon, toes curl, my heart racing
She got me nervous, but if I do say so myself
She gave me good service, skeet in her eye
Wiped the rest along her jaw line
She said, you nasty boy, you nasty boy
Now that's how you uwwind, wine and wine

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
