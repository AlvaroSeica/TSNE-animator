[Jordin Sparks]
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air-air..

[Solomon Childs]
I text you good morning to know that your there
I wish I was there, But I'm away in New York on business
Last time I saw you it kinda felt like I was on a respirator
And time had stopped, And for a moment I think my heart even stopped
Higher then cloud nine and there goes reality stickin it's big nose in
Where we gotta depart, And it feels like you leave with have of my
heart, No air

[Jordin Sparks]
If I should die before I wake
It's cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, Oh

[Chris Brown]
Im here alone, Didnt wanna leave
My heart wont move, Its incomplete
Wish there was a way that I can make you understand

[Jordin Sparks]
But how, Do you expect me, To live alone with just me
Cause my world revolves around you its so hard for me to breathe

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks &amp; Chris Brown]
Tell me how Im supposed to breathe with no air
Cant live, Cant breathe with no air
Thats how I feel whenever you aint there
Theres no air, No air
Got me out here in the water so deep
Tell me how you gon be without me
If you aint here, I just cant breathe
Theres no air, No air
No air-air, No air-air, No air-air, No air-air

[Chris Brown]
I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew
Right off the ground to flow to you
Theres no gravity to hold me down for real

[Jordin Sparks]
But somehow Im still alive inside
You took my breath but I survived
I dont know how but I dont even care

[Jordin Sparks &amp; Chris Brown]
So how do you expect me, To live alone with just me
Cause my world revolves around you its so hard for me to breathe

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
I used to think I'd never be with just one
I always wanted to have fun
Til I went and found that I could have fun with just one
One on one, I said somethin gotta give
I'm losing my mind we've been apart too long, You know I know you strong
But sometimes I need praise when you start acting helpless
Oh here's another word, Breathless, No air

[Chorus]</pre>
