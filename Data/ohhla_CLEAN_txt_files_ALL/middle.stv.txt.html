[Slush the Villain]
My middle finger's in the air
Cause I don't care
And I'm flippin em out
I'm trippin em out
Chewin em up
And spittin em out
On the other side of the strike zone
Cause I'm gettin em out
Shut the fuck up
Or get dick in the mouth
And get hit in the mouth
Mothafucka and beyond see
Run through you like Natron
The Bomb Beats
You better choose a new career
You're in the wrong scene
And you can compete
With my song themes and beyond flee
But to me, you ain't shit
Scratch you the way that my pit
Scratches the flees off his dick how
The way that my pit
Scratches the flees of his dick damn
You mothafuckas are all petty to me
And there ain't no Ese
Out there better then me
And that's that homie
You mothafuckas are all petty to me
Cause there ain't no Ese
Out there better then me

[Chorus]
Middle fingers in the air
Cause I don't care
And I'm flippin them out
Middle Fingers in the air
If ya feel me
Middle fingers in the air
Cause I don't care
Middle fingers in the air
Screamin FUCK YOU
Fuck you to bitch
[2x]

[Slush the Villain]
Cause I don't give a fuck no
I don't give a damn
I do what I got to do
And I'll step over any man
Cause I, wanna make a million
No lie, I'll put you to the side
Just to try and make a billion
So quit trippin and quit bitchin
I'm just smarter then you
Lickin outside ice holes
I'm more harder then you
Got you lookin up to me bitch
Even if I ain't taller then you
In the end I'll amount to larger then you
So quit botherin fool
Cause clearly I can't tolerate you
Your shit is way too dated back
It's time to moderate you exolerate you
Cause you don't let me concentrate fool
Put you out of the way
Now I can cleary I can conteplate views
Cause fuckin with me's that's extorsion
Cause I'm here to make a fortune
Blow this industry out of poportion
So don't you trip cause I'm better then you
This game just portrays
I'ma make more cheddar then you

[Chorus]

[Slush the Villain]
Fuck felons I got delieveries
So why this industry picture me
When they know they're gon get rich with me
But homie they ain't shit to me [what]
They ain't shit to me
Homie they ain't shit to me [what]
I said they ain't shit to me
But a bitch to me
Suckin balls lickin dick to me
So throw your whole fuckin cliq on me
And homie you can't get rid of me
I got more artillery and conflict
Then Bill and Hillary
And I got you stranded up and bleedin
In the middle of the desert
Homes, abanneded em and leave em
We handed em feet
And I busted em so hard in the grill
My hands started bleedin
My only fear is God
So how can human man defeat me
Nah uh, never cause I'm way too clever
Plus I'm down for what ever
So if you ever
You'll be sleepin with the fishes in the San Diego River

[Chorus]</pre>
