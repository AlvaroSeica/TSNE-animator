Song:   Trust Factor
Typed by: Davida.b.

[Intro: Last Poet 1 (Timbo King) {Bilal}]
We haven't trusted each other for so very long
Taught how to hate yourself, and everything is wrong
So we gotta make an effort (make an effort) to write another chapter
(Chapters, verses) what we need the most is the trust factor {trust factor}
(You trust me, I trust you)

[Timbo King]
Yo, Jesus and Nazareth, kings of the Jews
Only the wise man can play the star role of the fool
Armaggeddon strike, general strife for five stars
Trapped in this world of sin behind bars
Nimrod controling evil people with the truth
Street merchants that hustle for loot
Harbor the flute, greatest stories ever told of lost souls
Who were sold for only wine and gold
??? is a greek word that means to seperate us
Forty acres plus the fire place reperate us
This is revolution, black gangstas, you don't want it with us
We goof the devil, fuck Tony Blair and (cencored)
Black throat, black flicks like Trump Turner
Top of the projects with nuff burners
Think a beauty is joy forever
And a family is one when they stay together, pray together, trust factor

[Chorus: Bilal]
Learn how to trust each other, for so very long
Taught how to hate yourself, cuz everything went wrong
Gotta make an effort to write another chapter
Cuz what we need the most is a trust factor

[Interlude: Last Poet 2]
So paradise was trashed, was put on the market, was labeled fantasy
And so you dream about it, but dreams are always deferred
Was chocolate candy melting in the sun, and so, she looked into his eyes
And he looked into hers, and both of them were to blind to see the
lies they were living
Because their lives were a pattern of lies before they were born
A script handed down, written by false prophets
Except in praise by the people who lost their way
And for one moment, in the quiet of your being
Can you trust yourself, can you touch your heart with sincerity
And feel secure about you, jump into the ocean without fear of the sharks
Without fear of drowning, can you trust yourself well enough to trust
someone else?
Or are you running because someone is chasing you?
Are you speeding down the highway because you think the cars are
coming after you?
And when paranoia becomes a companion, demons sit on your shoulders
Like vultures on a telephone wire, grinning
And waiting for whatever good inside you to rot
To die, so they can feast, you made friends with the beast
And noone can save you now, the devil is on the prowl
Noone can save you now, the devil is on the prowl

[Chorus]

[Bilal]
Gotta trust more, it's the only way, it's the only way
Only way, yeah yeah, trust factor, trust factor
Love factor, love factor *sings to end*
