Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
But it's too late, I can't control these people
They're out there, they've gone with their guns
and it's too late!

[Chorus]
They've got guns~! 45's, machine guns
and they've got artillery, and they've got artillery
They've got guns~! 45's, machine guns
and they've got artillery, and they've got artillery

[D-Sisive]
If I said it on a record, I meant it
Step right up and test it, now you fucked up metric
Head spin when I step in a cipher
Headsweat L.V. serenading Phifer
Heads remain under what I'm writing
Rhymes go over new eras when the lightning... strikes
Light bulb on
+The Boss+, Springsteen, Michael, Scott
You slingshot, I'm Spectre on an opus
45 Magnum, +Selleck+ in the holster
Jeff Goldblum, no reference
I just wanted to say Jeff Goldblum
cause I can, and still sound so cool
"Sooperman Lover," +Noble+ in the phone booth
I'm all tunes, by smashing
16's like Keith Murray with a bar stool

[Chorus]

[Muneshine]
You hear the strings fly around the notes
Here take this string to tie around your throat
Hung up on hope yet it's pointless when fate's left to coin flips
Your fate's sealed when the coin hits
the tabletop, fuck the state of hip-hop
It's a rat race, fast paced, you need a pit stop
Murder was the case, Sam Sneed recognized it
Jonestown, hometown hero on some fly shit
And now the record biz on some sink or swim
Watch us float by comfy with a wink and grin
Thumb and index, fingers point, tip the brim
This is them, them is us, us is next of kin
Who, Willem Dafoe? No reference
I just wanted to say Willem Dafoe cause I can
You feelin him, no? Not a smidgen
Me too, reach for your God or religion
Where's the guns?

[Chorus]</pre>
