[Talib Kweli] *talking*:
Yeah...
As we continue on..
Yeah (We recordin' in the house)
Ladies and gentlemen
This the soundtrack (In the natural sound)
Do not be alarmed (Children playin')
Don't panic, be calm, yeah... (Crickets chirpin')
We gon' hit you with... with the words
We gon' hit you with the music (We in Fort Greene right now)
'Course we gonna hit you with that Kweli shit

[Musiq]
One of these days a change gon' come
For you and I and our children
Where you can live and just have fun
Don't nobody trip on where you come from
Everything is good yeah it's all love
It's freedom in the hood for all to get some
It's every woman to a man
To a child to a fam
With all us on a higher level of understanding
But if it's gonna take a while I'll chill
I can bask in the glory on that day
And if I gotta chill then boy I will
It's no problem for me because yo I be
B-Boy position standing here
Anticipatin' patiently just waitin'
To grind out for my dream
And you (you) can't stop me boy

[HOOK - Musiq]
Listen...
Ladies and gentlemen don't be alarmed
This is the soundtracks of what's goin' on
And if you want you can get it
I promise you if you let it
The rhythm'll be good to you
Yeah, let the rhythm be good to you
I promise baby it'll be so good to you
And now, you 'bout to witness the sound
Of these Words, Musiq, and Kweli

[Wordsworth]
Community blocks waitin' 'til my opportunity knocks
But the door is usually locked because it's usually cops
Most of wish we had a car and jewelry shop
But spend my days tryin'a fuck or find a movie to watch
Talkin' big plans to live large and move from the block
Your only option from your moms is to move to ya pops
Cigarettes tryin'a hold on to the few that you got
Price is crazy high for you to give up a loosies a lot
Areas we from you scared you don't run
Don't care what you've done
Be wary of tongue snitchin' 'n' hope the jury is hung
Tryin' to go from zero to one like a hero becomes
While here air in my lungs ideas I share with my sons
People down here so shady they could stare at the sun
Can't wait 'til that unemployment check clear once it comes
Daily routine, but my only theory when young
Was get money, get a job and hope her period comes... it's real life

[HOOK]

[Talib Kweli]
Walkin' the block at night I, stopped at rhyme cypha
Circle of rhyme writers broken up crime fighters
They said we loiterin' started orderin' us around
We ain't jump at the sound of they voice,
They said "Get on the ground!"
This cuz we black or what?
I'm sick of cops harassin' us
Probably because we ain't degrade ourselves fast enough
The people passin' us stopped 'n' the cops start actin' right
Somebody had my back tonight
Off they go in a flash of light
You try to see the future take a mental picture of it
City life is hard when your apartment don't fit in your budget
You need to get a room like people who kiss in public
Plus you tempted to say "Fuck it" until you kick the bucket
There's more to life than appears it ain't no crystal stair
As nails'll stick out 'n' snare you and this is crystal clear
Ain't no officials in chairs or fans that scream your name
It ain't a game but it's still a challenge just the same

[HooK]

[Musiq]
But if it's gonna take a while I'll chill
I can bask in the glory on that day
And if I gotta chill then boy I will
It's no problem for me because yo I be
B-Boy position standing here
Anticipatin' patiently just waitin'
To grind out for my dream
And you (you) can't stop me boy
