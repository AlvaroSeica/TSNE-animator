Song:   Papa Didn't Raise No Punks
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus: C-Murder]
Papa didn't raise no punk nigga
My daddy was a drug dealer, straight killer
He said, look em in the eye before you kill em
And stay strapped with the gat, and make em feel it

[Crooked Eye]
Pops is a G, still 17-3
Came out the pen and made me, his prodigy
Laced me up, and taught me the game
On how to bang to the boogie, and boogie to the bang
Just see walk that walk, soldiers don't talk
Keep it real, or have your body outlined in chalk
And be a man lil' nigga, depend on yourself
Don't depend on no help, what you could do for yourself
When it's war best believe, have no fear at all
When you go in come out winning, or don't come out at all
And uh, look a man to the eyes before you kill him
And leave no witnesses, they can't prove you did him
Be a rider, do your dirt alone by yourself
So if you caught, you the only one that could snitch on yourself
Keep it real, remember there's no honor amongst thieves
Choose your homies carefully, niggaz turn like leaves best believe

[Chorus - 2x]

[Billy Bavgate]
Me and my papa, had the same bloodline
He was involved in crime, he stayed in jail all the time
He taught me how to hustle, for a dime nigga
Now I'm searching his room, I need the nine nigga give up the loot
'Fore you die I'm earning my stripes, papa kept a nigga high
I prayed that they told em, that I'm a No Limit soldier till I die
But my mama had to pass away
I'm getting high, up on her birthday
This ain't the worst day, knowing I'm a bastard child
They say my pop's and me, we have the same smile
Look at me now, a blessed child on the tank
My papa told me, fuck what another nigga think
Lil' nigga get your loochie mayn, and stack your paper for a rainy day
That's why they ride nigga, ride with his gauge
Papa told me when I hit em, try to make the front page
Or repent before the last days

[Chorus - 2x]

(*C-Murder talking*)
Check this fuck the world, ya heard me
Bossalinie, Steady Mobb'n, just a bunch of ghetto niggaz
Ghetto status ya know, ex drug dealers
But not ex thug niggaz ha, ya feel me
Straight killers, papa ain't raise no punk
I know a lot of niggaz they ain't have a papa
But they had a thug figga in they life, ya feel me
So uh, papa didn't raise no punk nigga</pre>
