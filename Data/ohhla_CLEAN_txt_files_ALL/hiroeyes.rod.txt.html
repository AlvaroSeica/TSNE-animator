[Intro: Li-Mouse]
This is how it went, man
It's like that, yeah
This is exactly how it went...

[Li-Mouse]
They marched toward, with the strength of a hundred horses
Me as the target, against the masses of these forces
Holding their flags high with dedication
I stand still, calm in the state of meditation
I can hear the clanging of weapons and their chatter
One against all, heh, to them it doesn't matter
There's no use to run, no use to hide
The warrior inside me says defend your pride
Much struggle when I try to reside, I cried
Right before her last breath, she died
With a bow on my back and the sword on my hip
The canteen was close to empty so I took the tip
Will it be my last drink, or will I live to tell another tale
The sharpness of my blade and my mind are the only way to prevail
I see the whiteness of their eyes, pupils stare at me
Ready myself, I guess they found where the rat be
But, I'm Mouse and they don't know what's what
I can feel the heat from the bodies, my eyes stay shut
I take my last breath, battle is too close
My depth without others, death is what I fear most
The brisk wind scrapes along the dirty faces
I keep my breathing steady as my heart races
To the, finish, but no, I'm not finished
I won't rest until all my enemies are diminished
The march halts and they surround me with anger
Little did they realize there was much danger
No, not from me, but the danger from them
I was determined now, I will slay these men
They start their chant to try to, shake and scare me
I can smell their fear, hot stale and fake the air be
Only seconds away from the spilling of blood
It's hard to move do to the steep sticky mud
What's this now? They were all struck with silence
I knew the time was close, the beginning of the violence
All I hear is the air, traveling out my nostrils
Swords were drawn out, they became mad hostile
It only took one man to make the final scream
He ran toward me, there's no I in team
He whipped his first swing, and he missed the next
I made sure that I would alter his sex
The soldiers ain't like that, so they all rushed in
The tip of my blade quickly moved and hushed them
Soon enough the whole crowd stepped a little closer
I put a hole in one man's stomach, like it was an ulcer
It grew to an all out battle
I had to put many men on their backs like they was horse saddles
And I had to let them know, I was mad serious
How I put my sword up, feeling, mad imperious
The footsteps of them sounded like tap dancers
Unfortunately I must kill, that's the only answer
I make things hot like the month of the Cancer
The technique evolves with every swing, the enhancer
This ain't an act, man, I don't like to put on shows
Get straight to the point, only for those who oppose
I became five pounds heavier due to blood soaked clothes
Then it was over, I could tell by the meat picking of the crows

[Cno Evil]
As the birds hovered over my brothers I felt fatigued
How could they all die, and I could just bleed
I can't believe I'm still alive, after this battle
Revenge was the only thing on my mind, I had to
Bury the bodies of my family and my friends
The sun hits the sand, tears evaporate again
We used to hold our flags up high with dedication
But now I stand alone just a one man nation
How can one man take down my whole army?
Killed everyone in sight, and barely harmed me
I must admit, I think he's met his match
I started following his blood drops, I make a catch
Roll my force, into the village asking questions
Did you see this deadly man with dangerous weapons?
No hope, nobody has seen this assassin
Until one woman had the answer for the question that I'm asking
"Yes, I know him, but I won't give you a lead"
"I'll just say, he's the father to my seed"
So to give him a message, I cut off her head
As it slowly rolled down the hill, I saw him
Screaming with anger, but he knew who it was
The result of the disaster that he had just done
He killed everyone, and even though he won
He rushed against the last man, his sword well swung
Ducking and blocking, he knocked me off my horse
Dagger against my throat, he felt no remorse
For all the death that he had caused, he didn't even care
But killed everybody for the same reason that brought me there
So as we stood, we both understood
So the look in each other's eyes and knew it wasn't good
He knew my every move, as I jumped, he dashed
I have never met a man that can counter my attack
As he leaped over my head, I somersaulted off his back
His flying kick almost hit my leg, but I leaned back
I tried to hit him, but he blocked my arm, threw me to the ground
I tried to kick up, his iron fist hit me real hard
Then like a hiccup, my lungs jumped, I felt a short breath
Thought I was reaching my death, cuz out my mouth came red blood
I was laid down like a rug, and his blade started to dig
Deep into my heart, he had one last bug to rid
But as he blinked, I grabbed his legs and swinged him
Crashed into the wall, bricks fell, dust blocked my vision
As it cleared, he disappeared into thin air
My sense told me that he was behind the wall, so I went there
He was dying and bleeding, but he tried to reason
And as a man of belief, I really believed him
He told me what he did was a disaster, and his soul sworn
To have a revenge for his ancestors
I knew exactly what he felt, deep inside his heart
But our bloodline is what really kept us apart
Maybe one day, we can team up and rule the world
As I felt safe, I slowly put away my sword
He went to shake my hand, but he ripped it right off!
I fell onto the floor in slow motion, real soft
As he stood over my dead body, he laughed
But little did he know I had on a bomb, about to blast...</pre>
