Uhh...
Awwww it's the Humpty Dump truck, big wheel wall crumbler
If money did talk yours probably be a mumbler
The bumblebee-colored kush burnin in the bubbler puff
Brother Rocks Dougie but it's uglier 'round that other stuff
I'm sayin though, weighin only about 175
I sound like a heavier guy
But we high, so high five, behinds and nice thighs
When the sun beamin, flickin off the old blue Beamers hoodie
And Woody Allen couldn't see it with his glasses on
At homecoming gettin drunker than the chaperone
And don't you hate when you go into a place
and somebody need a I.D. cause they done left that at home?
You feel bad if you go ahead and leave 'em
So you try to swap it out and hope the doorman believe 'em
Yo he take cash, send a check to him directly or money orders
Every dollar four quarters

[Chorus: Chuck Inglish] + (Mikey Rocks)
While I drive, break, shift
(Ridin, swervin, bigger than Suburbans) Jump down!
And I drive, break, shift (slidin, swervin, right through the curb and)
(Shift, swervin, they all get nervous) Jump down!
While I drive, break, shift (slidin, swervin, right through the curb and)
(Ridin, swervin, bigger than Suburbans) Jump down!
And I drive, break, shift (slidin, swervin, right through the curb and)
(Shift, swervin, they all get nervous) Jump down!

[Chuck Inglish]
And I just touched down, pillowcase-sized clouds
Louder than that pound like your neighbor's at your door
ROO! Dawg, take yo' jaw up off the floor
Meet your neighbor Chuck Daly, it's the liveliest coach
Bless his soul, it's amazin though, the same as goes
Kept his soles rigid, but the seats ain't that color
Mike Rock copped a Range, had it flickin last summer
Size 900 with the turbo runnin on 'em
Gold VVS's, in the zone is a Nexus
Supposed to been flexed on y'all niggaz last summer
Chill.. we ain't have to move a muscle
At a court case pendin and we hit the ground runnin
Get your rap together, you ain't talkin 'bout nothin
Loose lips sink ships and y'all ain't talkin 'bout none of us
And this 45 back on my #9
'94 +Can't Touch These+ like it's Hammer Time

[Chorus]</pre>
