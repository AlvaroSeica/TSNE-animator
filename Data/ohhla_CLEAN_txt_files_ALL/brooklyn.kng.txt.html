[Timbo King]
We got dat for sale, back from Hell
Snitches that tat to tale, we stack for bail
Ya'll not fucking with us, cuz we got
Po-po, duckin' from us, trucks 'r' us
Feds wanna stop the cash, I smoke mine
'Dro with lots of hash, nigga, holla
Hollatotious binaca blast
One shot knock a... yeah, aiyo
And no, how you gon' rap on 106 &amp; Park
I know niggas that sell crack on 106 &amp; Park
Rock and roll, watch these rocks get sold
Five hundred thousand viles, on the block we gold
Hot pipe, burning ya lips, inhaling the hits
You coming back with some furniture, selling the shit
You wanna rap, here's a track, muthafucka
We got gats, g-packs, muthafucka

*instrumental*

[Timbo King]
Aiyo, I rock many, sell rocks plenty
Just cop me a finny, Henny all up in me
Smellin' like old Vinny, projects look like mini mansiosn
Bust down cancer sticks, pants and kicks
Fuck ya'll, guns go off
Speed of heat fire, god we trust
Cuss or curse, muthafucka that off the cliff
Let off the fourth, the fifth, cold winds blow
Quiet the gift, shoot ya'll, execute ya'll, marksmen
Throw darts when the dark ends
Yeah, I'm all vexed, gortex, study the math
Forty-five, caliber blast, holes in your North Pole compass
Stomp yo ass, rugged terrain
Code name, Bo King, stay smoking
Hancock, Knickerbock, Church Ave., lick a shot
I rep any hood, pick a block, nigga...</pre>
