Yeah
Come on the desperation stay the same
Grip tight to the reins, smoke lights by the chain
You won't find no letter by my remains
Not caught dead settling
No black sweater, slacks or shoes
With any pennies in a federal sake
A steady hand ready to drop stakes through any bloodsucker
Sick of the news, yeah eat him up
Cover him up like headstones in the fall
We don't stop, keeping it warm, keeping it hot
Treading water and our lives in tide
Throw it on, ride whatever we on
Dawn whenever we wonder, we don't ask why
Correct, the best shoe's the worst step
Some tools to work with, confused and worthless
Peruse the surface but don't dig deep enough
Wait, they, they turning in they graves
We, we dig them up and rearrange
Aim, take them out the way they came
Switch them out the frame
You got to find something else to hang
You didn't get mature, you got tame
They ain't the same
Thoughts convertible, that's what I'm on
Keep living in your box
What is that, a Scion?
Cool, it's all fool's gold, ask me
What's the goal fool?
Dig deep, like six feet

Speak, retreat, whatever, don't ask me
I'm busy working with that shorthand shovel
Fools ready to pound moves, bloody knuckles
Keep the surface free, don't ask me
I'm busy working with that shorthand shovel
Fools ready to pound bloody knuckles, don't ask me
Speak, retreat, whatever, don't ask me
I'm busy working with the shorthand shovel
Speak, retreat, whatever, don't ask me
I'm busy working with the shorthand shovel
Fools ready to pound bloody knuckles

Graves, shovel, let's get to it
We wrote the book, they'll have to remain truant
We wrote the book by moving the blame to it
We wrote the book by keeping the change
Digging up graves, shovel, let's get to it
We wrote the book, the hobbies will stay ruined
We wrote the book, the hot remain stupid
We wrote the book by checking the aim
Digging up graves, come on, shovel and bones
We wrote the book by cutting the dead clones
We wrote the book by smashing a dead phone
Getting a good second alone before
Digging up graves, shovel, let's get to it
We wrote the book by moving the blame to it
We wrote the book, my civil just ain't do it
We wrote the book, now look at the fame
Digging up graves</pre>
