[Chorus x2]

Down South we like to
Get it Crunk! Get it Crunk!
Get Drunk as a skunk and
Get it Crunk! Get it Crunk!
Every Man and Woman
Get it Crunk! Get it Crunk!
Big Ball and G we

[Eightball]
Calling all pimps and players
We need to unite and get with other player fakers
Hardcore and ain't nothing gone stop that
When it hit the streets real niggas cop that
Down south pimp shit nigga you know 
Who got flow in the cocaine benzo
Preimro yeah fat mack that's me
Chunky with nuts and chocolate like hershey
Punk tricks wanna flex but the truth is
Spage age pimpin pay the motherfuckin bills
You wanna ride with the Suave House don't ya?
You wann fuck with them hoes who don't even want ya
Check my cup everytime it's full of hen dog
check my chick everytime she a ten dog
Take it how you wann take while I break it down
Orange Mound nigga this is how we clown

[Chorus x2]

[MJG]
Alright you show you got some yak in back let me check it. 
anybody scared to get down gone get neglected
Champagne drinking ass niggas gone try to check it
real niggas drink it or not just gone just  respected
any bitch who make big money gone get selected
but all hoes who got big mouths gone get ejected
take yo ass back to the spot you rested
I don't a fuck cause you fine and big breastsed
or your brother crazy they say cause he been tested
or way back when you was a child you got molested
we still getting crunk you know it that's why I stress
don't you see theat ring in your face it time to bless it
but bitches wanna ride my wood and try to peck it
crash all into my game and try to wreck it
my game to dame deep trick you can't expect it
MJG from Memphis to Houston, Texas

[Chorus X2]

[Thorough]
It's time to come fresh on these niggas cause I'm a blessed nigga
Suave House nigga who want the plex nigga
Nobody, move parties for a hobby
Then lobby with the hotties and kick the lottie dottie you got me
I'm a hard rapping cat southern mack born and bread
With lyrics that would leave most dead, I'm so close to the edge
That I could jump pop the trunk 
Shoot the pump BOOM and give these niggas what they want
Hits for hardcore and soft asses
Hoopties to e-classes cups and blunt ashes I'm mashsin
Down the track doin all the high hats
Bustin at the bass line where the treble at? Fuck with that
Live at the show I make em clap
And say go Thorough when they see me rap in fact
I got the knack to make the whole place bump 
grab a drank and don't thank as we commence to get it crunk

[Chorus X2]</pre>
