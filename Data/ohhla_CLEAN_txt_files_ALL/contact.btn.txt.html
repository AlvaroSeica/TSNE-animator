Get hi hi high

And we all just hi hi high 
We puff la la la la la la la la la
Beatnuts get hi hi high
Junkyard

[Marly Metal]
I caught shorty's eye at the bar
She had an ill shape she like a guitar
Light skin chick Dominican star
Offered her some drug in jar
20 minutes later I was getting stud in the car
Let's watch a little dirty tv, pop the ecstasy
Hide the little flash shorty selling ass for me
Smoke smoke when you're done I'ma poke poke
And I ain't gonna stop til you're little bad broke broke
All the ladies shakin the ass
Got a la make me wanna take ass
You know the rules man take to unpass
Always rowdy rowdy since the day you met me
Especially off that leaky lead that Juju sent me

[Psycho Les]
Grasshoppers catch contact
Then they be like 
Can I get a hit?
Can I get a hit?

[Chorus]
I puff la la la la la la la la la
I can't lie I get hi hi high say what (2x)

[Psycho Les]
Aiyyo the avenues hot
So I'ma fly a couple days
Pack my bags walkman hit the fresh double As
Let's pick up a box of dutch masters so I can twist the bootays
Then a box of jim hats so when I stick a cutie 
Aiyyo if this ain't the raw shit
Then what the fuck is
Why bitches wanna know where the function is
Why niggas always askin for production tips
Knowing damn well there ain't no touchin this
My break beats make me cut wind like baked beans
Catch me chillin pullin bitches on 8th street
That only want a platter of hot sex
We could get high so you can pop ex

[Chorus]
I puff la la la la la la la la la
I can't lie I get hi hi high say what (2x)

[Gigante Juju]
In New York we smoke chocolate
Keep a loaded gun in the cockpit
And almost every night we on the block lit
Handlin the biz bagging the driz
Drinking beer between the buildings with the gremlin kids
Man I've seen a lot of things go wrong
Make me wonder how I be so strong
I got the heat to make the beef prolong
You know Ju ain't like the type to talk
Keep it movin if you like to walk

Sigue por alli

[Chorus]
I puff la la la la la la la la la
I can't lie I get hi hi high say what (4x)

You all ready for this
Smoke it up smoke it up
Beatnuts
Catch a contact real quick
