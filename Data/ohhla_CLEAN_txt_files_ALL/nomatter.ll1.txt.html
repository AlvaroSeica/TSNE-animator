Verse 1: Prime
I'm trapped in the mind state gettin fly like magic rugs
Doin and sellin drugs and praisin the thugs
I was programmed this way so it ain't my fault
Too late to turn back I might change an assault
A whole lot to get into with little to do
Hit girls right the first time so it's deja vu
Payed the price my whole life, my attitude's a reciept
Easily learnin life's ill's that are so hard to teach
When I was crazy young I had ton's of fun
Nowadays life's a bitch or a son of one
Maybe to get this money I just really don't have the knack
Maybe I'm on borrowed time that I can't pay back
Or maybe I'm caught up in some Elm Street Dream
And to get the hell out I must wake up by any means
But how can a war be one, if no one had a fort
Drinkin flamable solution, returnin to this thought

Chorus:
No matter how loud I pray, God don't hear a sound
That's why I put my joint to the sky, let off a round
Cause can't no other man
Feel this black man's but another
With no dough, goin insane
(repeat)

Verse 2: Prime
Everyman has two lives, so there's two stories
But both of mine are inbetween right and wrong like purgatory
I express a lot of heart when I write
About these stressful days and these nights cold like ice
It's just like bad dice, you press your luck and you roll
With efforts to make cash and now you in a deeper hole
Oh no you wake up
Cops all around and now you in some hand cuffs
You need some bail money but your fam wanna front
You think to yourself where your plan slipped up
That's when your girl says she missed the time of the month
That's when you feel funny and strange in your gut
It's just that shit
That makes a nigga grab the clip 
And just all out flip
My rap flows real
Fuck flavor, I kick real life in your ear
I'm god sent
Drinkin strong Brandy just stayin bent

Chorus

Verse 3: Prime
Sometimes I want it all, but I know it can't happen
So I buy pens to support this rap habit
You silly rabbit, see tricks are for kids
I'm not tryin to do bids and get fish like squids
I'm on some power moves, against the powers that be
I'm in another realm, against the powers that be
Can you dig it?  
If you do grab that shit, twist that shit and swig it
And taste the truth
And feel the proof 
That's comin live through your speaker
My thoughts are deeper, on the last page like a beeper
Life is like an erection and some ass
It feels real good, but it don't last
So take a bowl and pass, cause gettin by ain't a game
In these last babylonian days
Drinkin flamable solution with a painful thought
Drinkin flamable solution with this thought

Chorus</pre>
