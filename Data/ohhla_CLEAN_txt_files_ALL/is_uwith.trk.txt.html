Song:   Is You With Me?
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Apocalipps]
Is you with me, I need to know if you with me (Staten Island, stand the fuck up)
Is you with me, I need to know if you with me (Ruthles Bastardz)
Is you with me, I need to know if you with me (You got that weed, light it up)
Is you with me, I need to know if you with me (They acting shifty, Truck, yo get 'em)

[Truck]
Yo, where the Truck go? Yeah, stop right here
Yo, ya'll niggas can eat, God, but not right here
Fucking with my paper, pa, I get you popped right here
Ambulance coming down the block, stop right here
Yo, my name is Truck, but you can call me Denali
Cuz I be rolling up Cali, rolling to Cali
You can catch me out of state with that Arm &amp; Hammer
Talking to the local thugs with that country grammar
Like I got, ounce for six, and two for eleven
If you front, muthafuck, I got the mack eleven
And a bunch of Bastardz, ship you fast to heaven
Ya'll can all be on the news, late night at eleven

[Apocalipps]
Aiyo, check the way my grammar spit, like a banana clip
And once them hammers clip, watch how ya man's a bitch
Ight, peep my man you strip, watch how I handle this
White pearl handle grip, light you how a candle stick
Aight, understand this shit, don't put ya hands on Lipps
Cuz them bullet'sll clip ya, like Los Angeles
I don't descriminate, I burn black, white and Spanishes
And you'll be up in the ma, like them sandwiches
Your man's is sweet, I'm raised off violence
Get played, stomp you out with grey suede New Balance
Bitch made, big gauge, knock your ass off balance
Switch blade, show a nigga that, he ain't no challenge
This way, he stayed, he got hit with the talents
Six days, he lay, he got hit with the silence
Send his ass to St. Vincent's Asylum,  shit
I made a call, and told my nigga Beno, chill I got you

[Bless]
Aiyo, raise up, fake niggas get they jewels popped
My intricate plot, hand's clap one in your knot
From back in the days, I still got my accurate aim
I slap shots like Gretzky, work the bat like McGrire
Eye for an eye, he comes from your door sock
Propellers on helicopters, pop off in the sky
I put your lights out, no way can be at Candlestick Park
It's Pop Ya Head Off, graffiti style, carve it in your face
It's Bless, ya'll, and ya'll don't really wanna pop off
Rob you for your sneakers and leave you with just your socks on

[Chorus]

[Beno]
Let's go niggas, this is Planet of the Apes
Don't get the four fifth planted to ya face
Cuz damn it, you ain't safe, you ain't all the way in base
This is Beno talking, the one who told you people ain't walking
The one that smash ya face like a walkman
They respect me in New York, they know me in Boston
Cuz I'm that dude, that's just that rude
That'll clap that fool, just for his jewels
Plus I stick to the rules, and I follow the G-Code
I cock, pop, and then I reload
Hit you in ya eye, your thigh, your back
You don't want none son, so leave it at that
This is 418, son, you know where we at

[Iron Mic]
Nigga, fuck you and what you repping, I here alot of
Gun talk, nigga, pull out ya weapon
If you ain't got a gun on you, nigga, get to stepping
I use mine to bang out, not just for protection
Them same niggas that you dick ride, I advise you to warn them niggas
Half ass bars, I'm better than all them niggas
I'm not a punchline rapper, I'm not a fucking actor
I'm a Ruthless Bastard, I bang the forty and clap ya
Pop off when we want to, pop off when we have to
Remind these muthafuckas exactly what we after
That money, money, ain't nothing, funny, man
Run up in the crack spot and take every fucking gram
Survilance in ya house, shoot out every fucking cam
So niggas hanging out, tie up every fucking man
Your kids in there to? Make 'em watch Pokemon
While we put the money in the bricks, up in the van

[Chorus]</pre>
