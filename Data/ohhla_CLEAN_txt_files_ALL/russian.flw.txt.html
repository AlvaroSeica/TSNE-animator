[Intro  Someone talking]
Some of the music we play is
Is really not geared for your bumping and jogging
It's geared for you to think
So for those of you who don't think too much
I'm just telling you about that shit before we drop it on...

[Chorus  2x]
Yo, you ever do something dumb like you ain't been schooled yet
You flipped back and break out in a cold sweat
Worst-case scenario is just what you'll get
When the eyes catch-up playing Russian roulette

[Verse 1]
Yo, whoever smacked the bareback and got scared that night
Mad paranoid for days, hypochondriac for life
Seven minutes in Heaven but six months to know for sure
Now negative is positive, I can't afford the cure
I'm thinking crazy thoughts like wash it off
That shit will rinse away all common sense lost
The state of disarray eventually fades
But what's hear to stay, potentially AIDS
Should I get checked out or not maybe I should go
But if I got it I don't really want to know
Decisions, decisions, it ain't too much fun
You put yourself in this position don't acted stunned

You like it bareback?
Never get scared of that
You want to wear (facts)?
Ain't trying to hear that
I see a clear path, headed for Dooms Day
Fuck around and find out the hard way...

[Chorus  2x]

[Verse 2]
Now I don't this chick, or who she been with or nothing
It's just a no strings attached fun night of fucking
My Jim hat had better fit I want to stick something
Squeezed the tip release the air and began pumping
I'm mad smooth baby ?(macking the month)?
Is it the way I move or just the African musk
I know it's bad news if this shit will happen to bust
But I'm a sex expert cooling back in the cut
So after thirty minutes in I feel this warm skin
I think my Trojan lost the battle ain't no condom this thin
I'm instantly shook and momentarily dazed
Too scared to look, it's too late to be saved
I got to retrace my steps correct the mistakes
I'm never having sex again but I might masturbate
Enough big pimping time to drop the addiction
I'm a hustler now, I just sent in a subscription

You like it bareback?
Never get scared of that
You want to wear (facts)?
Ain't trying to hear that
I see a clear path, headed for Dooms Day
Fuck around and find out the hard way...

[Chorus  2x]

[Verse 3]
Now I can't forget the women y'all are far from innocent
Giving into lies like "condoms make me impotent"
Besides guys say it's more intimate
And if ain't raw dog they can't get into it
Let's cut through the fog and check the crystal ball
You need a babysitter now he forgot to withdrawal
And picture this, ? is on your shit little bubbles
You would double the risk and these a but couple troubles
Life long effects from a simple action
Diseases show no discrimination or compassion
It's single elimination if you think I'm wrong
You'll say, "Damn, I should have listened to that Strict Flow song"

You like it bareback?
Never get scared of that
You want to wear (facts)?
Ain't trying to hear that
I see a clear path, headed for Dooms Day
Fuck around and find out the hard way...

[Chorus  2x]</pre>
