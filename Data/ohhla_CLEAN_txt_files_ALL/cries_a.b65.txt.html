I was raised on a dirt road, ghost town
Stray dogs hold down, the gold mine closed down
I knew the woods like the back of my hand
And I would shoot the breeze with the roots of trees
Go down by the river and watch the way the devil dances
But never took his hand even though I did have several chances
Everybody slipped when the morning dew turned to frost
Darkness moved in, somebody burned the cross
A girl named Stellar Kewan was prettier than you'd imagine
The town should've given her the crown for the beauty pageant
But instead some local pinheads started spreading rumours
About the Kewan's being in-breds, and what's worse
People believed it cause the family was dirt poor
Down on the luck so that made it hurt more
Pickin' up garbage and mowin' the grass
At this point Stellar stopped going to class
You know how they ridiculed the kid in school and this shit's
Enough to make anybody feel like a misfit
She made herself invisible and hid inside a house of mirrors
Whenever the fear stops so did the tear drops
But fear is forever and lies become legend
Growing eventually, slowing exponentially
She should have been a cover girl treated like a princess
But she's an enigma haunted by the stigma of incest

She tried to hide the scars, her name reminds me of the stars
I saw diamonds divide, corners of her eyes
She tried to hide the scars, her name reminds me of the stars
I saw diamonds divide, corners of her eyes

One horse town known for the most softest
Little old school house, burned down post office
Blueberries and bullrushes, a tree with a tire swing
Volunteer firemen's fared the whole entire thing
Stellar was heartbroken, decided to start smokin'
Bad taste in her mouth, she drew to a sad face
Her few friends were worried and her parents were always proud of her
But she never escaped from under the cloud cover
A woman reduced, she was eaten by a monster
And after all these years, her past still haunts her
And whispers her name when she's trying instead
To just listen to music while she's lying in bed
Now the story of Stellar is one that every child knows
But the witch in the woods is more like a wild rose

She tried to hide the scars, her name reminds me of the stars
I saw diamonds divide, corners of her eyes
She tried to hide the scars, her name reminds me of the stars
I saw diamonds divide, corners of her eyes</pre>
