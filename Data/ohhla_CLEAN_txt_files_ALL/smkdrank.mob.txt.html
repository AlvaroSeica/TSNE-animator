(Intro)
That's cool
Smoke, drank, fuck
That's cool
Smoke, drank, fuck
That's cool
Smoke, drank, and fuck
That's cool
Let's smoke, drank, and fuck
That's cool
Let's smoke, drank, and fuck
That's cool
Let's smoke, drank, and fuck
That's cool
Let's smoke, drank, and fuck

(Hook)
I feel like I got a bad habit
Feel like I gotta have it
I'm smokin and I'm drankin, shit you know that's automatic
I see ho watchin me, and yeah she the baddest
If I get her to the crib, shit I'ma let her have it

(Master P)
All I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck
That's all I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck
That's all I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck
That's all I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck

(Verse 1)
Got a whole lotta money, drank a whole lotta liquor
Like a whole lotta women, not a whole lotta niggas
Stackin money on my right, a bottle on me left
And y'aint gotta feel me bitch, I'm feelin myself

(Master P)
Eyes hella red and I'm smokin that kush
I'm the chairman of the label, but I'm not George Bush
Call my old mamas and my girls in the Bahamas
Red hair like Rhianna and I fuck her like Madonna
Pop a steel it's no drama
You know I'm not a sponsor
You'll find me in the club with the heater, like a monster
And the Louie V Mob nigga, that's my clique
No Limit Forever and we in this bitch

(Hook)
I feel like I got a bad habit
Feel like I gotta have it
I'm smokin and I'm drankin, shit you know that's automatic
I see ho watchin me, and yeah she the baddest
If I get her to the crib, shit I'ma let her have it

(Master P)
All I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck
That's all I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck
That's all I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck
That's all I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck

(Verse 2)
I'm in the club, two bitches and a double cup
Holla at who I fuck tonight, on the floor holdin rubbers up
Got so many bottles and bitches by the bundles
Don't make 'em eat that ham, I'm tryin to touch they tonsils
Red bottoms, Louie red jackets
White and yellow diamonds, lookin like egg salad
When I say I'll flip her, don't mix it with gymnastics
Make that bitch get nasty like I'm her baby daddy

I said I'm smokin, drinkin, fuckin
Are you bout it or you duckin?
I tell that bitch I'm a playa, now that's the end of discussion
Remy, OG, and rubbers
I fuck 'em but I don't love 'em
They jack em, I skate and duck 'em
Can't trust 'em, it's all or nothin

I'm the nigga Bengie, and all I do is lean
Smoke, drank, and fuck; Real niggas know what I mean
Take her to the 'telly, say she feel it in her belly
The way that ass shake, man I swear it must be jelly

But jam don't shake like that, man I swear I'm ballin
She show me them titties like Mardi Gras in New Orleans
Man them broads callin, they know I'm gettin rich
But I've never been a trick, you don't get nothin but some dick

(Hook)
I feel like I got a bad habit
Feel like I gotta have it
I'm smokin and I'm drankin, shit you know that's automatic
I see ho watchin me, and yeah she the baddest
If I get her to the crib, shit I'ma let her have it

(Master P)
All I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck
That's all I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck
That's all I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck
That's all I wanna do is just smoke, drank, and fuck

That's cool
Let's smoke, and drank, and fuck
That's cool
Let's smoke, drank, and fuck
That's cool
Let's smoke, drank, and fuck
That's cool
Let's smoke, drank, and fuck
That's cool</pre>
