Chorus (J.Bizness)
You see we
Break bread in the Golden State
If you from outta town then you know from the gate
We got
Palm Trees gangbangin and the best smoke
But there's so much more to the West Coast
So pay attention and avoid the fakes
Dirty Cops and baffling unemployment rates
And there's a lotta strain it can put upon ya
But it Still Never Rains in Southern California

1st Verse (Audio Live)

Most people come here with a dream to chase
Knowing only Hollywood &amp; ain't never even seen the place
But for me it's all I've ever known
And I feel it in my face when the Santa Ana winds is blown
Yes
It's nothing less than the Mecca
Avenue of the stars ridin in a double Decker
It's such a broad spectrum in this place
From Hue Hefner to Maria full of Grace
The pace is so fast and it ain't slowin
It might swallow you whole man if you ain't knowin'
From wild fires and homes getting burned down
To applications turned in and turned down
But the beauty is still unmatched
And the doors always wide open and unlatched
A broad mix of prosperity and pain
Dark ominous clouds but it still, never, rains

Chorus (J.Bizness)
You see we
Break bread in the Golden State
If you from outta town then you know from the gate
We got
Palm Trees gangbangin and the best smoke
But there's so much more to the West Coast
So pay attention and avoid the fakes
Dirty Cops and baffling unemployment rates
And there's a lotta strain it can put upon ya
But it Still Never Rains in Southern California

2nd Verse (Trek Life)

I'm from the 626
That's from the Cov, Du-Rock to Pasadena
Anywhere in-between em
To Glendale
We inhale Death and turn the beat up
Sinners to non-believers just tryin' to beat the heat up
My homie passed the bar
We backyard celebrating
Playin bones barbequing burning the weed up
His little brother behind bars we pour it out for em
Be a minute before we see another re-up
It's just the ying and the yang
In a city where they bling and they bang
And it's an even exchange
To play a broad homie trust me they'll do you the same
So we treat em like we treat they can leave or they stay
When I say the bitch I can't even explain
How some a these broads act when they be from LA

Chorus (J.Bizness)
You see we
Break bread in the Golden State
If you from outta town then you know from the gate
We got
Palm Trees gangbangin and the best smoke
But there's so much more to the West Coast
So pay attention and avoid the fakes
Dirty Cops and baffling unemployment rates
And there's a lotta strain it can put upon ya
But it Still Never Rains in Southern California

3rd Verse (Skeem Price)

See she
She my guardian
Angelist from the high-speed chase
To hoppin over gates
And I spit, my soul as I walk these roads
And kick rocks to the clucks and the stash I goes
And on me
The palm trees can talk
They chop the lines in the chalk
The K9s would bark but they can't
So they don't yeah ain't no snitches
So we speak with the stitches
Cars and the Bitches
Stars and the riches is what my aim fo'
Reason why these youngsters bang fo'
Born and raised but the 9 area codes my home
Towns where I roam
Clownin the globe
Servin in the stones with the keys in front
Plottin on Hollywood just to see the stunts
And my broddy doin 65 all from caine
So just feel my pain but it still never rains

Chorus (J.Bizness)
You see we
Break bread in the Golden State
If you from outta town then you know from the gate
We got
Palm Trees gangbangin and the best smoke
But there's so much more to the West Coast
So pay attention and avoid the fakes
Dirty Cops and baffling unemployment rates
And there's a lotta strain it can put upon ya
But it Still Never Rains in Southern California</pre>
