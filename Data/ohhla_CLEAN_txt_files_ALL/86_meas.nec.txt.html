[Sample: Interview with Gene Simmons of KISS]
Interviewer: "Now, let's get to the studded codpiece. Do you have a sense
of humor about that? Does it seem funny to you?"

Gene Simmons: "No, not at all! It holds in my manhood."

Interviewer: (laughing) "Oh, that's right!"

Gene Simmons: "Otherwise, it'd be too much for you to take. You'd have to
put the book down and confront life. The notion is, that
If you want to welcome me with open arms, I'm afraid you're
also going to have to welcome me with open legs."

Interviewer: "That's a really obnoxious thing to say."

Gene Simmons: "No it's not! Why should I say something behind your back
that I wouldn't say to your face?"

Interviewer: "Has it come to this, that this is the only way you can talk
To a woman, to do that shtick?"

Gene Simmons: "Let me ask you something; why is it shtick, when all women
have ever wanted ever since we crawled out of caves is
"why can't a man just tell me the truth and just speak to
me plainly?" So, I do that. You can't have it both ways."

[Verse 1: Necro]
Some bitches are stupid, I treat 'em like shit
That's how you get one to eat a dick
Never be sweet to a bitch, keep it sick
They like to get dissed, they like it rough
Women are so fucked up in the head, some like to get snuffed
And they come back for more
Cause "Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus"
That's why they like to suck penis
Don't ever let them tell you different
Women are just as horny as men
They're just programmed inhibition
That's why Catholic school girls are the biggest sluts
Down to take it in their butts
They're always lickin' somebody's nuts
And why not? That's why God made 'em
Adam was kind of lonely, so God took one of his ribs and created 'em
Cause before that, Adam was fucking animals
That's why women like to get fucked like animals
It's only natural
And don't get the wrong idea, don't think I hate bitches
I love women, that's why my masturbating's religious
I'm just stating facts that are down to take a smack
And they'll break their back bending over for you if your thing's intact
They say they're not into games
But those are the dames playing the most games
The type that'll suck on a dick for cocaine
They're acting like they're so tame
But before you met them, they fucked fifty cats, and can't remember no names
Tell them right off the bat, "I want you to suck on my sack"
And, most likely, they'll respect you and let you cum on their back

Yo, the more degrading I get, the more these ladies get wet
It's only busted bitches that can't take what I said
Well fuck busted bitches, they make my dick limp
They're useless to a sick pimp like me who needs his gratification instant
But one thing ugly bitches are good for
Is being good friends that'll lend you money when you're poor
So shout out to the homely, and my deep condolences to you bitch
Cause honey, for the rest of your life, you'll be lonely
And I know some of you are sayin' "Necro ain't all that"
But yo, men don't even have to look good as long as they rap
Motherfuckers that are fat will have you on their lap
As long as he convinces you he's an emotional cat
And if he's a cold person that got money
Most broke bitches will take the cock in their tummies
They're not dummies
Money turns bitches on
Once you're broke, the bitch is gone
Money'll have a bitch in a thong stripping to songs
It'll have a bitch in a porn getting shitted on
I want so much money I could get any girl to sit on my schlong
But I've been broke for centuries
And haven't had a problem yet getting a girl to bend to the knees

I guess that's how you know you got game
I could be broke and bummy and still get the same as a cat that's got fame
I know cats that trip, they're practically paying the bitch
And they can't even play with the clit
Cause she's saying some shit
Portraying like she's afraid of dick
Because you're too stupid to realize she was created to lick
She's playing you quick
She'll hold out on the pussy the longest possible time she can make you wait for it
Cause once she gives it up, you might diss the slut
And she's thinking like business, son, "let me milk everything out of this schmuck"
She don't give a fuck, 'cause most men are foul
And we're down to fuck any girl in their bowels, we get around
So we're looked at as bank accounts
Amounts, like a quarter-pound or an ounce, but bitch, my checks will bounce
Not sayin' all women are like this
But yo, I got no problem with it
I'll pay the price if she got the right tits
I see nothin' wrong with payin' for a tight clit
If I'ma pay for anything, I might as well pay to excite my dick
I've paid for worse things, you should pay for something that'll last
Like a French maid with a fat ass
If I had mad cash, I'd open up a whorehouse
Honestly, I had this bitch in my crib frontin' so I threw her out
She wasn't suckin' dick correct, the bitch was wrecked
She should've known that when she hit the deck
Not to stop suckin' until she whipped her neck
After all, I bought her a beer
And you'd think she'd be grateful enough and able to stuff a cock in her mouth
And make sure I'm taken care of before walkin' in here
But no, so I threw her out in the rain with no dough in the freezing cold

Skeez and do what you're told
Cause once a slut gets old, you'll be payin' me to suck my pole
Cause when a man gets old, he blossoms
But when a woman gets old, she starts rotting
There's not too many options
Just plenty doctors with operations and lotions
Liposuction and face lifts and Noxema for old skin
You can't escape demise by taking some weight off your thighs
It's a law of nature to die
You patronize Death when you old bitches use a facial cream that says it age defies
These companies are playing games of lies
That's why these 85-year old billionaires are taking wives that are 25
So what's my point?
You bitches better lick up
Before corrosion eats your lips up
And they aren't soft enough to dick suck

[Sample: American Pimp]
"It ain't easy, man. It may look glamour like this, because you see me ride ya dig?
Snakeskin down to the floor, ya dig? I'm tellin' you, it may look easy, but you're
gonna have to work to get to this category, baby. See you at the top."</pre>
