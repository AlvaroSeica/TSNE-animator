[Trigg-nomm]
Yo, look what the block done did to the kid
Got me on the run from the pigs, rocking a wig
Baby carriage, glock and a bib, some not knowing it's Trigg
Others like, yo is he Trigg? He blowing a cig'
Be on the, blow in the crib, got dough in the crib
A o in the fridge, 'dro in the fridge, Don, Crys', Mo' in the fridge
I stay in the crib, wit a fly bitch
Be it Bedstuy or a C.I. bitch
That get low, like an M.A.R.C.Y. bitch
Or I be on 125th, in Grant Projects
Eating food wit Gotti, P-Nut and Lil' Fool
Pistol packing dudes, quick to cock back and clap a fool
ASk around, check the attribute
It's only natural, we clap at you
Damn, look what the block done did to the kid
Me and Rel used to run together, now we don't even have fun together
And Lil' Mikey think he big enough to fight me
Wit other youngings on the block who wanna be just like me
While busting my gat, I be bubbling crack
While parleying in Cali wit Dogg Pound writing wit Shaq
Who can say they opened for Big, the game was no gimmick
Pac was gone, Wu was strong, Snoop was down wit No Limit
So I done, been wit the best, and did it wit the rest
Now I live wit the stress, and get it like I know best
Look what the block done did to my man
They done murdered his whole fam, I'dda renigned wit his hand
Look what the block done did to the God
He done got hit wit a hundred yards
Left a wife, three seeds and his mother scared
I know it gotta be hard, when cats sing like they Chico DeBarge
Look what the block done did to the team
Who comes clean, who really fake, who turn states, who took the weight
Who copped cook, then chopped, then distribute the weight
Who got hooked, who got popped, who smart and got away
When gangsta is what gangsta does
And we live wit gangsta Crips and gangsta Bloods
Who do gangsta shit, strictly, for gangsta love
Is you gangsta bitch? Or is you a wanksta, cuz
You get paper, dick ? Or is you a paper thug
Who got paper slick, now you really think you thug
Look what the block done did to our babies
Look what the block done did to our ladies
Got fifty percent of us shady
The other fifty percent, on some if and maybe
If it was a fifth, we be sippin' Hennessey and blazing weed
Look what the block done did to you, B, it do the same to me
Whether I'm O.T. or at O.T.
Look what the block done did to the love
Look what the block done did to the trust
Look how the block bust back when they rush
Look what the block got us doing to us
Til we in the box, the cell block, ruining us
Look what the block done did to the dream
I'm on M.L.K. Boulevard, pleasuring key's wit a triple beam
Look what the block done did to the fiends
Look how they come back, similar to how the ones stack
Or when the funds slack, how the M1 clap
I'm on the block, making a come back, what, nigga</pre>
