[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem, right after autumn falls
Soaking it all in, then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain't balling, feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here, come give a kiss to Santa Claus

[Kanye West]
Yeah, uh, Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all living the good life
Yeah, though it's forty below the wind chill
and we wiping snow up off the windshield
It's still, wonderful night to be alive baby
And I'm, so happy I'm with my baby
And we, a lil' late with the Christmas gifts
Rushing for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that "You the star at the top of my Christmas tree"
My only question is "Where my presents?"
She said "Shhh", she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think mami
Now pour some more eggnog in your drink mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said it's deer-icious, hahaha

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]

[Kanye West - over chorus]
Yeah, uh, uh
I'm like Bad Santa though
Everybody sit on my lap~!

[Vado]
Merry X-Mas, Santa Claus cherry X6
They ain't hear my reindeer/rain dear, make it snow on the next chick
Got enough toys, wondering what's my next pick
Before my exit it get diamond Rolex reckless
Big bags, got everything on the checklist
Necklace, Baguette wrist, pockets fat, they +Precious+
Give ma a peck kiss, look and tell her she precious
Lighting up the sour, this tree give me the best gifts

[Jim Jones]
And I remember when I couldn't play Santa Claus
No reindeers, just horses and a Panamera Porsche
We on two-fifth shopping, what the damage cost?
I got your fam while you bidding in the can up north
I'm at Nieman's, hope they still got 'em
She want them thigh-high spikes with the red bottoms
Let's make a toast because Christ is born
We gon' party all night till the lights come on

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]

[CyHi Da Prynce]
Yeah, mom and dad, I won't be home for the holidays
Huh, I'm over eight-hundred miles away
in the city that's so pretty
where the hustlers dash through the snow without a sleigh
Tell my family that I'm sorry that I gotta stay
I'm with 'Ye at the Macy Day Parade
Letting the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I'm in New York I'm still repping for the A

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]

[Pusha T]
Yes, it's GOOD Music y'all
Check it, uh, uh
On the stoop of that Brownstone, shovelling the brownstone
Santa's on a diet, gotta get the pounds gone
Downtown got me feeling like it's Dow Jones
But uptown got me feeling like it's down home
Snow like sugar hill, chains on wheels
We turn our two-doors into snowmobiles
We got our own style, no Soho feel
Put on your play clothes, how that logo feel?

[Big Sean]
Oh, pause for them photo stills
You don't wanna miss a moment, where's your NoDoz pills?
I caught her looking at my Rollie as my mojo spills
Snowflakey on the bezel, hope you know those real
Okay, my white girl Veronica, black girl Monica
got me celebrating ChristmaHanuKwanzaakah
Rocking dashikis with a yarmulke
Where the Christmas tree at? Let's design it up

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]

[Cam'Ron]
Uh, Lenox Ave. to Saint Nick, never seen Saint Nick
Just niggas selling the same nicks, the same bricks
Same hustlers running up the broadway
That's where the snow's at, taste it, foreplay
No turkey or greens, just Jimbo's
Christmas lights in project windows
Shouts to the coldest on my barometer
Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah

[Teyana Taylor and Musiq Soulchild]
All the flashing lights up on a tree
The house lit up so niiiiice
With your family's where you wanna be
here on Christmas niiiiight
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don't that make you feel goooood?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
let's have a Christmas in the hoooood

[Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashing light
Yeah, don't they shine so bright?
Always for you and me
Baby, you're Christmas Eve
If you like what you see
Won't you come sit on my knee?
and tell me everything that you want
cause baby I'm your Santa Claus

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]</pre>
