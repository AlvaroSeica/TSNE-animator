[Long Axe]
I might listen to Coldplay on a hot day
Singing my troubles away, pushing them puddles away
I don't need another mother today
I've already got one
Mouthful of thousand
Hands on my body and you leaving without them
Pushing every button tryna figure me out
About the view from the balcony, nigga trickling out
Got time invested, while you tested
I used what you try to abuse, right you guessed it
Wish it for a real man, yeah I am
What you gonna do when I hum for you?
Getting funds for you, one for you, hunt for two
Cut blunts, this ones for you
Mild-mannered like Mrs Banner
When I come home you changing like a stranger
New suit, mean attitude, home rearranger
Pieces of a dream scattered
I'm long gone 'cause they've been shattered

[Chorus x2: Long Axe]
Don't say this, don't say that
Change the lyrics, everybody's a critic

[Long Axe]
Three strikes but I never hit you
Ducked just in time when you threw the picture
I rushed at you running to the kitchen
Tryna grab that knife knowing I could have split you
It take two to argue and one to be alone
But when my pen hit the paper, I'm writing a poem
I need my head combed
'Cause now you on the phone crying while clutching the receiver
You scrolling through my beeper
Who's this? Who's that?, how you sound now
Trust rusty, emotions all mushy
Saying shit out your neck thinking it was gonna crush me
You need a pinch of reality
And a dash of sense and personality, you lack that
But talk back like a chiropractor
Cutting the set like a director with a bunch of actors
I'm like a spatula, flipping the scene
A free agent baby, switching my team, switching my team

[Chorus]

[Long Axe]
I never thought that it would come to this, fighting and tussling
Thinking out loud it might heighten the loving
But you screwing with the wrong driver, I'm ten inch shoe
And the two that I lost had some friends just like you
Pecking like chickens on the hair early day
One went crazy while the others just flew away
Now they're lost but a lesson in life
Can't take mercury and try to make it your wife
You need stability, 'cause looks be like judging a book
Cover the horror story real gory
Take a look at the passion involved, dating and single
A man gave his heart and came back with a jingle
'One Love', 'One Love' and if you take your time
Maybe you can 'One Love' I'm done, Love</pre>
