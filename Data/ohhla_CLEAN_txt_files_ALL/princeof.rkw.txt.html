[Verse One]
Prince of thieves, catch me in the trees
Four long under the sleeves covered in leafs
Dark knight shooters ruegers black capes
Folded over ranglers, the gold dobermans with keys
Run the town crack smiths we clap kids we want a ransom
Or drop him out the molson, just answer
Who run them niggas who run niggas, did sum'n
But, don't want nothin, just don't cuff 'em bluff 'em
Pyramid mansions we get grandsons
Take 'em out of space take apes now go plant some
Yeah meet me at the end of the road, been through the globe
No hopin in and out this shit is global 
We hood moguls with vocals niggas ride local
Never been nowhere we drop niggas out in the Poconos
Yeah a bunch of Rondos with condos, forty five hollows
Ready to slide fly to Chicago
Eyes closed money makin Pablos, who slob hoes
Never I rather to sit and then kill I go
Yeah yellin bravo, with all myhood niggas live though
This how the forty five blow

[Interlude]
This is that real live extra, rap calligraphy good shit nigga
Only built for real niggas man, real motherfuckers man!

[Verse Two]
Godfather energy the ghost's played
Aiyyo I balled one for minutes then strayed I only drive karmas
Baseball hats and diamonds, come to disgrace y'all niggas ain't, place of martyrs
Automatic magnets swag bets niggas'll grab necks
Break your collarbone apply next
You switch off and hit the globe we into numbers with different goals
While niggas bitchin we in the rolls 
It's glowin, plus snow and stay off my circumference 
Homey where bosses live for real and it's lonely
Everybody strivin to feast we in the belly of the beast
Leeches, starvers niggas want a piece
That's why I stay humble and hard
Cross my path the wrong way you dyin and I'm flyin to Greece
Swim like Phelps over beats, I rhyme with the elites
Who live off the land takin your eats, nigga
