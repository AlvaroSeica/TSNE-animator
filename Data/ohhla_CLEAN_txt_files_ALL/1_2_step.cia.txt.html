Ladies and Gentlemen
this is a Jazze Phizzle Productshizzle
"Missy" The princess is here "Ciara"

[verse 1]
This beat is
automatic, supersonic, hypnotic, funky fresh
Work my body, so melodic, this beat rolls through my chest
everbody, ma, and papi, came to party
grab somebody, work ya body, work ya body
let me see you 1, 2 step

[Chorus]
Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see you 1, 2 step
I love it when you 1, 2 step
Everybody 1, 2 step
We about to get it on

[Verse 2]
This beat is
Outrageous, so contagious, make you crave it
Jazze made it
So retarded, top charted, ever since the day I started
Strut my stuff and yes I flaunt it
Goodies make the boys jump on it
No I can't control myself
Now let me do my 1, 2 step

[Chorus]

We gon drop it like this

[Hook - 2X]
It don't matter to me, we can dance slow
Whichever way the beat drops our bodies will flow
So swing it over here Mr. DJ
And we will, we will rock you

[Missy]
I shake it like Jello, make the boys say hello
Cause they know I'm rockin the beat
I know you heard about alot of MC's
But they ain't got nothing on me
Beacuse I'm 5 foot 2, I wanna dance with you
And I'm sophisticated fun, I eat filet mignon
I'm nice and young, best believe I'm number one

[Chorus]

This is for the hearing impared
