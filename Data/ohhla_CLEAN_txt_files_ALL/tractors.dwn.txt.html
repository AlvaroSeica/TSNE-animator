(Basically - listen
There was tractors, rakes and hoes)  --&gt; Black Sheep

[ Soda Pop ]
Yo, pass the ho and let me dig into the soil
Cause true hoes will only let the tempers boil
I've been hackin at you for a decade
I peeped your card, I saw your ace of spade
Now you're ass out
Pour your drink fast and then you pass out
Catch fifty winks
I know the situation stinks
Cause I can't support ya
Quit tellin me 'bout what your last boyfriend bought ya
You know the bizzat
The fuzz and the fizz that's comin on the diddat
But hear me in CD and when I start to peepee on your hoe
Hoes, if your boyfriend is a chump
Tell him don't leave no ho next to a tree stump

Tractors, rakes and hoes
Tractors, rakes and hoes
I need a - tractor - a rake - and a hoe

(Gas 'em up just like they're at Texaco)  --&gt; MC Serch

[ Shawn J-Period ]
I know about the hoes in the south
I dick with my stick, not by word of mouth
I tell ya, the bosoms, they bloom like Azalias
(If you light the candles) they blow like Mahalia
Huffin and puffin, thick from eatin that grandmother stuffing
With lots of buttered muffins
Some girls, they wanna live straight like a butterknife
Cut down trees, spendin all your cheese
Plase, you heffers cheese for the camera
You wanna blame me for some damn propaganda?
Better take that pull back to the Schlitz malt liquor where you got it
Don't hide it, divide it, girl

Tractors, rakes and hoes
Tractors, rakes and hoes
I need a - tractor - a rake - and a hoe

(Gas 'em up just like they're at Texaco)  --&gt; MC Serch

[ Soda Pop ]
I grab a rake when it's time for uprootin
From your mouth you're shootin, but I don't hear ya
I'm near ya because of your girlfriend Sophia
And I use the rake to cover my tracks
When they hoes flip and start to come in stacks
Cause the name is Soda like Down South blow
And if you ask me, I don't know the hoe

[ Shawn J-Period ]
Ignition, startin up my tractor
Plowin up hoes like throes of tabacco
After intercourse I like stogies
Watch Humphrey Bogey on a flick, it's a oldie
I prepare the hoagies on three
I put the pumper in your nickel
I don't like a fickle when playin with my classic
Plastic, girls take your pills
Cause you don't want no children right now ( ? )
Prepare for this plowin, start the trac' right now
And please get the hoes out the shed
I need

Tractors, rakes and hoes
Tractors, rakes and hoes
I need a - tractor - a rake - and a hoe
