69:Here we come. And from this point on...

69:And Mr. Lemonhead... 
-Give me a funky bass drop. 
69:Sit back and relax and relieve your mind 
and get ready for the trip to Land sixty-nine, 
Where the girls are fine and full of fun 
and they outnumber guys like ten to one. 
We got trains, planes, and other thangs 
like Dom Perignon and chicken wangs, 
and a motel you can lodge at 
and plenty clothes for the big money boys to flodge at. 
Yeah, it's the place to be, 
guys gotta pay but girls get in free. 
So, come on and have a ball 
bring a comb, a toothbrush, and extra draws. 
And I hate for you to miss it all, 
so, you better move swift shoot the gif and get your tickets y'all. 
So, tune your radio in, 
cause the sixty-nine tickets go to caller number ten.
