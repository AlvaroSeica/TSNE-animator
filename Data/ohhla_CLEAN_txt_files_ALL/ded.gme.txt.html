Song:   Dedicated
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Dedicated to all my niggaz up North
Dedicated to the dirty South of course
Dedicated to all my niggaz on the East
Dedicated to West Coast niggaz is beasts ...
This from us to you and all of them
don't get gas my nigga watch your rims

I started off in a hood, in what you would call a lemon..
Me? I was a nerd, niggaz thought it was a gimmick
Now I got the maybach, curtains in linen..
White maranella with the burgundy in it
Tinted?
For real
Now watch how we spin it
River side drive in about 5 minutes
4 5 2..
achoo..
Make a nigga sneeze when we ride by you
Ice cream jeans with a march yellow top..
Polo 7-5-8s with socks
Am I high?
Fa sho
How we count dough?
We count commas..
Yall niggaz count 0's
Come to VIP nigga we can count hos...
Don't forget the candy pan sittin on vouges
Plus I got banana clips under my clothes..
This is redicated to niggaz that flips O's

[Chorus]

Ayo come to Garcon..
Y saunt lauran
You ever seen the hard bottoms on a long vauze?
The bullets make a nigga hit the bottom real hard..
You ever seen the spikes on the new Lou Vuittons
Spike a bitch drink make a bitch go hard
Red Air Max with the fuckin Go-Karts
When you already did it, what the fuck is go hard?
Synchronize automotives, walk out with no charge
Wit yo broad,
Oh lord, while your wife at somewhere typin
We on Rodeo somewhere swipin
You do it like Nike, my shit Lightnin
Back to back Lambo, inside frightnin
This shit criminal we should be indicted..
Your chicks riding shotgun, had that as dikin
Like Paquiao fightin
This shit is exciting

[Chorus]

Top down, bumpin Bar-Kays..
Hermes bucket with the Tom Ford Shades
Four shades..
Four seasons..
Six-Fours..
More reasons..
More money..
Whore season
Are you listenin mah?
Your cheesin
We at the Staples on the floor, whole season..
Its the pink slip club, nigga no leasin
Ya ex-boyfriend, Policin...
Brush em off like my moncler fleece son
You know I'm gang affiliated, don't get naughty
We could call henchmen..
Or we could call shorty
Or we could call Hector..
Or we could call Jorge
Papi owe me favors..
I know he wont ignore me
Everybody loco niggaz gotta show me..
Tell ya girl there's a fire in my pants..
Blow me

[Chorus]</pre>
