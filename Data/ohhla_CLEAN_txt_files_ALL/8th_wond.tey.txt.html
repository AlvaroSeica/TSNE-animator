Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You are sent from up above you are so divine
You are wondering is there a mystify fight
Can you touch my eyes I just can't deny
You are form another world
You bring the light that shines so bright
Can't lose those you know I can't get enough of you
I told you go to the moon
Is just simple things that will give me a sun [?]
Is like the air I breath give me the wonder
Forgive me [?] nothing just knowing
You are my 8th wonder
You are my 8th wonder wonder
Hey baby how you are doing
I just wanna hold you aha
Uu you brought the color in the room
You take my hand and never need a strength
You be my guy taking every side
You are form another world
You are form another world
You bring the light that shines so bright
Can't lose those you know I can't get enough of you
I told you go to the moon
Is just simple things that will give me a sun [?]
Is like the air I breath give me the wonder
Forgive me [?] nothing just knowing
You are my 8th wonder
You are my 8th wonder wonder
Hey baby how you are doing
I just wanna hold you aha
I wanna feel you I wanna squeeze you
I wanna please you</pre>
