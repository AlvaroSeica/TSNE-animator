[Automated Voice]
While listening to this song take it easy
Don't dance or make noise at all
Please don't march or scream and please refrain from any erratic behavior
Never mind, go crazy

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
(Spaz on)
Both in the 70's, 80's baby, I'm a cause to the death of me (on)
Yosemite level, middle finger's up to haters who slept on me (snore)
Although you may say this, you'll take it back to stick your riders in heaven at (war)
Me you are related, you pat fucking, back stabbing, livin' on different rap (you)
And I ain't aimin' for the middle, tryna eat and get the viddles, I ain't talkin 'bout a little bit
And I ain't ashamed to be the Mental Giants protégé, many niggas is getting blown away
Nickname kali baby, women on my men, I see them goin' crazy
And if you feel the same as me come on and go insane with me

[Chorus]
If you feel like you'll go insane then
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
Everything you think is not the same, still
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
If you test the water prepare to swim
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
You might just go crazy instead of them
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!

[Verse 2: Krizz Khaliko]
Kali baby, do what you never did, come to get cheddar, enough that I get it (around me)
Let them be getting some money, twitter it, you niggas actin' confederate (nina)
People react just a minute ago in tv and all off in the video (genius)
Ohkay oh-oh I'll say it again if you didn't know (watch me)
Ba-ba-bablin' better than half of you rappers, I spit like a javelin (stop me)
Trapped in the traffic compadiris, you niggas earthlin' and I'm off of saturn and (me)
We'll be the bestest from the midwestest, go get your people, your men in here (flee)
Cause I can damage it, you niggas amateurs, I'm son of sam and I'll handle it (uh ohh)

[Chorus]
If you feel like you'll go insane then
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
Everything you think is not the same, still
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
If you test the water prepare to swim
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
You might just go crazy instead of them
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
(Dwam)
Incredible to the be back in medical procedures with kaliko slicin ya (ham)
Don't no body go hard as a motherfuck but just the murderers you hear in this (jam)
You don't ever wanna be the one to get it
When I rattle and you go psycho, go sick, and crack on top of the beat (ben)
I can be real onery my personae be all you gotta honor me (the king)
Better believe us
We will level you negra's
Like a devil deceiver's rippin you to pieces screamin' on Jesus
Chopin' the big boss, often awkward profitable thoughts will profit often cash
They make rappers lose it off of the music but never to be home and take cause I'm a spaz (uh ohh)

[Chorus]
If you feel like you'll go insane then
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
Everything you think is not the same, still
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
If you test the water prepare to swim
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
You might just go crazy instead of them
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!</pre>
