Song:   Where U From, Pt. 2
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Rubbabandz]
Let me tell you bout a place, where I come from
You can't walk in the pawn shop and cop a gun
But can't walk down the street, unless you got one
With dustheads waiting in the cut, beating 'em
Smoked out on PCP, brain cells gone
Running through the projects, with no clothes on
Little kids playing in the park, not even dark
Screaming out 'mommy, what the hell he on?'
He on that 'sherm stick, shorty, water water water
Angel dust, fuck up a man's whole aura
Found out he had AIDS, fucked two of his homies
In the ass, and took his life away
I know this nigga named *cough* caught fucking his daughter
Hit that nigga wit the book, nothing less than a quarter
New York City's out of order, off the chain
I never thought I'd see these niggas gang bang
Oh well, that's life, shit change
Start set tripping over here, I'mma put one in your brain
And I don't give a fuck, what set you claim
Look in the barrel of my gun, there's a bullet wit your name

[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
Where you from, throw ya sets up, high to the sky
G.M.I., we don't die, we multiply
We don't run, we run shit, we ride
On bitch made niggas, don't act suprised
Where you from, Stapleton Projects, my nigga
Where you from, Staten Island, New York, my nigga
Where you from, a jungle full of gorillas, dustheads
And dope fiends, hustlers and killas

[Rubbabandz]
Let me tell you bout a place where I come from
Stapleton Projects, streets hot as the sun
My little homey got knocked, killing two police
I don't know what they thought, invading our streets
Fucking pigs, come around, flashing your badges
I don't give a fuck what your status is
Up on the roof, twelve gauge pump
Aim at the P.I.G. car and dump
This ain't Hollywood or Beverly Hills
This is Stapleton Projects, up the streets, Killah Hill
Filled with African niggas driving dollar vans
Personal Africans killed my man
J.D., John Chase, homey, rest in peace
Better believe ya name'll stay alive in the street

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
