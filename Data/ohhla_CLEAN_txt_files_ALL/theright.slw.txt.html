[Retrospect]
Uh, uh, uh

What's good Jamie?

SR, good music

Yea that's the right pitch

[Verse 1: Slow V]
Yo, yo, yo

Squeeze off and get a stab of it might ravel it
Rap addict who flips his style like a piss-y Craftmatic
And y'all don't want to battle it the flows is immaculate
You can tell it's real like boobs, just by the grasp of it
Been known to sink right from the brink no time to think
Can't blink, 'cause we're on point like ink
This is the type of shit to moves you and grooves you
Let the feelings take control, let your mind explode
Fix the pitch, like a cut that's just been in stitched
Influence the instrument just to give it an instant fix
Put you in that just right mood, that fuels and sooths
Just the type of tools you use, that that grooves and moves
This like being mute, and just now speaking
Gave you the opposite of what you frequently sees
Gave you a classic that'll stay in your minds
From the beats to the rhymes
Can't help from going back and pressing rewind

[Chorus]
Sooth it to the right pitch, do it to the right pitch cue it to the right pitch
Yea that's the right pitch {*2X*}
Move it to the right pitch, tune it to the right pitch groove it to the right pitch
Yea that's the right pitch {*3X*}

[Verse 2: Retrospect]
Yo, yo

Damn what a nice pitch, you've never heard like this
Cold as ice when we write shit, whenever the mic's griped
Frightening, you know that it's tight 'cause you like it
God has touched us right this is Christ enlightenment
This is what you would call perfect, raw purpose
When the kick and snare align to the bass and all verses
This lifestyle we chose it, hoping to be the dope-est
We come from a home of roaches and flowing is the way to cope it
You can't even describe it this is beyond rhyming
This is a picnic with your family on an island
With someone playing the violin away from the violence
Nothing but silence with good music to vibe with
Timeless classics with rhyming tactics
That'll have your ass asking, how do we manage
To write shit legit, you know that it's quite sick
And there's no need for tuning 'cause you know it's the right pitch

[Chorus]
Sooth it to the right pitch, do it to the right pitch cue it to the right pitch
Yea that's the right pitch {*2X*}
Move it to the right pitch, tune it to the right pitch groove it to the right pitch
Yea that's the right pitch {*3X*}</pre>
