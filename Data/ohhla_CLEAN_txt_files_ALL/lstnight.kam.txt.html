Song:   Last Night in Babylon
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Chorus) x2
I don't give a fuck if this world's gone
You better drink and party up till the early morn
Take your couple extra puffs so you're really calm
Party's over last night in Babylon

[Chief Kamachi]
I went to war with the Christians and Catholic Church
Wasted years praying and all I got is a back that hurts
If Armageddon comes then give me a mac that burst
I'm on the corner high; don't care who come or who's captured first
32 on death row eating my last desert
I leave the world peaceful; my soul will come back to Earth
I am not the body I won't feel the disaster hurt
Fossils from street apostles found in the grass and dirt
Maybe in a thousand years they study the master's verse
So well, I roll another L and its back to work
My queen got some tofu, maybe a sack of perk
I'm celebrating killing all the devils, some back to murk
I keep my dirty hands inside of the pastor's purse
They say that I'm an atheist but maybe my ass is cursed
Yeah right! Fuck your holy books and gibberish
I'm half-street, scientific spiritual niggerish

(Chorus) x2

[Chief Kamachi]
They've been in coming for years ignoring alerts
Who made you a prophet of the ONE you was following first
You teach 'em bullshit like whales will swallow the Earth
Niggas don't know nothing but hells, hollows, and hearse
I tell 'em they God, you tell 'em they humans and worst
I align the stars, put the sun and moon and a verse
7-7-7 it's safe to assume it's a curse
Black magic, maybe something crazy to ruin the turf
I feast, belly of the beast is ready to burst
Revelation, here to drag and ready to jerk
I sharpen the scimitar, doing the heavenly work
Black swift angels still hang with a murderous look
Malah, they don't understand all the jewels I drop
The knowledge is back, don't be one of the fools I shot
Ten tusks still don't understand how I move the rocks
Mathematician tell me is that your truth or not?

(Chorus) x2

[Chief Kamachi]
The party is over, it ain't a remains to search
New world nothing's better, look where the angel perch
Wave wands conducting the daily symphonies
I rule the world girl with mysterious entities
Some of them Guineans, but most of them Senegalese
At the door of heaven and didn't remember the keys
I am not a slave from the grave I sinned degrees
Little serpentÂ’s test me do nothing but tremble the leaves
I resemble holy temple so worship me please
I am the cure for the world and the worst's disease
A cold soul, people touch me and virtually freeze
It's cold music but that's just my personal steeze
God's wrath pray hard, looks like you're hurting your knees
Cloud open, cloud close, look at the wind and the seas
I'm from an ancient town, some say the greatest emcees
I'm so bad brothers steady and ready to spree

(Chorus) x2</pre>
