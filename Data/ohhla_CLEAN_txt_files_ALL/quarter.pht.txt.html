Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I retired on them boys so I be takin tabs
And you might go hard, but bitch I go ham
I retired on them boys so I be takin tabs
And you might go hard, but bitch I go ham
Throwin back like a quarterback catch me doin madden
This a muthafuckin club song why the fuck I'm slow dancin

[talkin...]

I be goin ham...

[Chorus]
I'm in the club hollin "where tha bad bitches at""
I'm in the back hollin "where the paint pills at? "
I be throwin back, like a quarterback
I be throwin back, like a quarterback
I'm in the club hollin "where tha bad bitches at""
I'm in the back hollin "where the paint pills at? "
I be throwin back, like a quarterback
I be throwin back, like a quarterback

[Phat]
I retired on them boys so I be takin tabs
And you might go hard, but bitch I go ham
Throwin back like a quarterback catch me doin madden
This a muthafuckin club song why the fuck I'm slow dancin
Now let me speed it up a little
Saw a yella bad bitch like let me beat it up a little
Betta take ya ass home kuz ain't no way you pass out
I catch my victim my victims slippin I'm a knock his ass out4</pre>
