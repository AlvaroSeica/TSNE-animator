[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah (yeah, yeah) yeah! (yeah)
Don Omar! (Don Omar!) J-Doe! (J-Doe)
Reek da Villian! Busta Bust C'MON!
C'mon! (C'mon)

[Don Omar]
That's how we roll! We roll like this! (We roll like this!)
That's how we ro-o-oll! We roll like this! (We roll like this!)
We roll like this!

[Busta Rhymes]
Now, now, now, now-now
Y'all know what we do, y'all know exactly how we rollin
And we huggin every BLOCK no matter how police patrollin
And we do it how we do it whether it's now or it's later
And we always handle business cause we 'BOUT gettin this paper
What you want? What you need? As we walk through every gutter
Every HOOD and every STREET and every BLOCK we got it covered
Throwin money while we in the club with shorties on our pole
Let's get it poppin in this bitch, me and my clique comin through
That's how we

[Chorus: Don Omar]
That's how we roll! We roll like this!
Th-that's how we ro-o-oll! We roll like this!
That's how we roll! We roll like this! (We roll like this!)
That's how we ro-o-oll! We roll like this! (We roll like this!)
We roll like this!

[Reek da Villan]
Yeah, hehe, yeah
Hey let's get it
(Reek da Villian, get 'em!)

Hoppin in any vehicle I choose
I get up in that 'vette and start it, all you hear is "vroom!"
Roarin up the engine 'til it pop like a balloon
Light my dutch, hit the clutch, throw it in gear and PYOON!
Ridin in the fast cars, drivin like it's NASCAR
Tearin up the asphalt when I'm in that Jaguar
Dippin way from NASA, red-linin the dashboard
Exhaust blowin fire like a rocket 'bout to blast off (blast off)

[J-Doe]
Yo, yo, J-Doe, alright
You know how we roll (roll) you know how we do it (do it)
You know we the realest when it come to doin music (yo!)
Don't wanna see me prove it baby, if I gotta lose it
then it's on, turn ya radio on, you gon' hear the newest
J-Doe spit, hate on this, why the hell you doin that? (huh?)
How the hell you be a loser hatin on me? I'm the best
I be pissin on competition, if there's any give me more
My flows'll let me get me use a fork, don't need a jimmy and a Ouija board

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
We roll like this, let me talk to 'em!

Here we go, here we here we go again
Pedal to the metal now we blowin in the wind
Top back, now you better stop that
If you try to front you already know we killers to the end
Every day we gotta go secure another win
Put that money where ya mouth will spend
Let's get it poppin, everybody know that
when we in the building, we be goin in
Couple Porsches, couple Bugatti's
Phantoms, Derek, Lam', Lenches
Couple of Maybachs, suited and booted
SLR McLaren, Benzes
Rollin, see the way we holdin
See the money foldin, everybody see the way we hit it
Chosen when we hit the road and everthing is golden
Y'all already know how we get it
(VROOM!) Peel out on they ass
160 read on the dash
Hand on the wheel and my feet on the gas
(CONGLOMERATE) got everything on smash
Don Omar, let's get it
Reek da Vill', J-Doe WHAT UP!
See the way we do it, see the way we cut up
Put ya money where ya mouth is or SHUT UP!
Legal shots, everybody in the place
let me see you put ya gun up
We gon' POP! Ready, if you ready
y'all already know the way we run up
When we come to take over the streets
y'all niggaz know the goal
Every time we put it down
the whole world know that's how we
