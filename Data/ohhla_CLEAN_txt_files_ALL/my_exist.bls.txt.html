Verse 1:

Underneath the ebony skin and muscle tissue
Lies the inner core of my being, no eyes seeing
Made to withstand intense pressure without scheming
Blast holes in demons and send them to hell screaming
Not the first of my kind been this way since the beginning of time
Designed holy Â– need to get realigned
Fifth of wine make my eyes turn glossy
Grandfather shaking his head thinking to himself that he lost me
Will them squandered years cost me, or will I learn from them
New days approaching fast, can't run from them
Sticking with my girl all these years 
She quoting movies saying, "All we got is all these years!"
It's hard to show affection when you're used to refraining
From displaying emotions, my shell's slowly decaying
I felt a breeze blow through me like eagle wings
Spit fire no amplifier listen the needle sings
The globe responded as soon as I released
Echoing the words I never unleashed
Tossed another plate on the bar, increased my endurance
It's easy now to raise the weight off my sternum

Chorus:

What's the meaning of my existence, the reason that I currently stand
Breathe air, still walking this land?
Could it be that my existence serves a purpose greater than I?
Maybe I'm just digging too deep for why
What's the meaning of my existence, the reason that I currently stand
Breathe air, still walking this land?
Could it be that my existence serves a purpose greater than I?
Maybe I'm just digging too deep for why, for why, but why?

Verse 2:

Coveting wealth, sometimes grabs the best of me
European sedans trimmed in lacquered mahogany
Dreams of travel, snapping pictures for the memories
Side effects when working from nine to five in misery
Mechanical behavior, the clock slides forward
Punching out and then we run fast towards
Relaxation, but only if the job ain't important
Otherwise we'd rather stay because our work is rewarding
I refuse to make this journey a prison with the dollar as a warden
Holding keys to doors not open
Unequipped with all the answers, but I'm not done learning
A deep thirst got my insides burning
