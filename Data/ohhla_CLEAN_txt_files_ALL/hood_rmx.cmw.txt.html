[Intro: Excerpt from an Unknown Old Western Movie]
[Cowboy] .. take life from a motherfucker (*Gun Cocked and shot*)

[MC Eiht]
Yeah, the Compton Psycho is back for the nine deuce
With a little sip for the niggaz

[Verse One: MC Eiht]
I got another gang story to tell
Peep, about how a black nigga was born in hell
And right then and there it's no hope
Cause a nigga can't escape the gangs and the dope
Damn! and when it's black on black, that makes it shitty
Can't survive in the Compton city
And fool's last bet
Cause when you grow up in the hood, you gots to claim a set
Yeah, it's not that you want to but you have to
Don't be a mark, cause niggaz might laugh you 
Straight off the motherfucking glock
Can't deal with busters so they asses get clocked
Yeah, who gives a fuck about another?
Only got love, for my fucking gang brothers
Yeah, but I'm young so nobody would wonder
That the hood would take me under

[Chorus: MC Eiht]
Somebody help me, shit!
Yeah, the motherfucking hood done took me under

[Verse Two: MC Eiht]
Now I'm a few ages older
Got hair on my nuts and I'm a little bit bolder
And putting in work, I has to do my fucking part
I'm down for the hood and it's planted in the heart
Yeah, at school slapping on the girls' asses
Fuck the white education cause; I skip a lot of classes
Cause ain't no teaching a nigga white reality
Teach me the motherfucking gang mentality
Pop pop pop, drops the sucker
If he's from another hood I gots to shoot the motherfucker
Yeah, I'm in it to win it and can't quit
Fool, and ready die for this shit
One Times can't fade the gang tough
Putting my foot in your ass to make times rough
I'm the neighborhood terror but I never wondered
That the hood would take me under

[Chorus: MC Eiht]
Somebody help me, yeah!
Yeah, the motherfucking hood done took me under
Somebody help me, Oh! shit
The motherfucking hood done took me under

[Excerpt from an Unknown Old Western Movie]
Let me explain something to you; if you're planning a shoot.. (*Gun Shot*)

[Verse Three: MC Eiht]
Now, I watch my back cause niggaz jiving
Times heard this brother pulled the 187
Who I thought was my homie dropped the dime
So I gotta peel his cap with the nine (*Gun Shot*)
Fool, so if it's on then it's on, fuck your G.B.
Cause how the odds are looking fool, it's either him or me
So I loads up the strap and I step
Cause my brain cells are dead and all I think is death
Revenge, yeah, that's what it's all about
See the sucker, take the motherfucker out
Stare the fool down with the eye contact
He try to swing so I draw on him with the gat (*Gun Shot*)
Blast was the sound that one times heard-up
Nigga 25 to live for the murder
Was it worth it I've always wondered!
Maybe if Compton didn't take me under

[Outro: MC Eiht]
Somebody help me, shit!
All my motherfucking niggaz say; the hood done took me under
Yeah, for the niggaz that got double life
What can you do homeboy?
The hood done took me under
That's how we do it in Compton..</pre>
