[Intro: DJ Khaled] (Mavado)
Fuck all that hoe shit! Fuck all you fuck boys! Bitch we real hustlers!
Get money! (Anywayyyyyy!!!!!) It's We The Best Music! 
Bad Boy! Coke Boyz!

[Chorus: Mavado]
I got my gun on me! I tell my kids I ain't never leave dem lonely!
Fuckin streets on me! Deathrow Jamaicans, murda yuh family!
Fuck what happens tonight! Fuck what happens tonight!
Fuck what happens tonight! I got my gun on me!

[Verse One: French Montana]
It was murder she wrote! You name a blood!
When the love gone! Your eyes diluted full of blood!
Six cars full of goons, six glocks heard the boom
Dreadlocks me lose two, head shots get tomb
Stone, ten shots, five gone
9/11 dial tone, you want it all, die alone
Full blown alone nobody safe from
Not be talkin to the judge when your day come
Like, it was hard not to kill these niggas
It's like a full time job not to kill these niggas
Eight figures need the eight-storied mansion
While I'm strapped up, two steppin with the devil dancin
Diluted with, blood in my eyes
Like the still born niggas won't, make it out alive nigga

[Chorus: Mavado]
I got my gun on me! I tell my kids I ain't never leave dem lonely!
Fuckin streets on me! Deathrow Jamaicans, murda yuh family!
Fuck what happens tonight! Fuck what happens tonight!
Fuck what happens tonight! I got my gun on me!

[Verse Two: Ace Hood]
Fuck it I'm ready to die tonight
Put it on mama that clip in the back and I loaded it twice
Just to call a way my niggas is ready no matter the price
Playin with mine you niggas can get it includin your wife
Isn't life a mu'fucker?!
Since seventeen that pistol been my blood brother
Sleepin with that +Lethal Weapon+ playin Danny Glover
AK-40 only only if we talkin numbers
Riders fuckin with mobsters niggas want beef, tell 'em to pasta
Load up the clip, shoot up your mobster bang bang, bless 'em father 
Pastor side 'em rest aside the lake, that's a man with stakes inside him
Look in my eyes I hate disguises knife or gun I compromise it
Oh Lord! I'm a ride on my enemies
If I die tonight I bet them gangstas 'member me
NIGGA! 'TIL THEN!  

[Chorus: Mavado]
I got my gun on me! I tell my kids I ain't never leave dem lonely!
Fuckin streets on me! Deathrow Jamaicans, murda yuh family!
Fuck what happens tonight! Fuck what happens tonight!
Fuck what happens tonight! I got my gun on me!

[Verse Three: Snoop Dogg]
From the depths of the sea, back to the block
With a bitch on my dick and a bottle of Ciroc
Tic toc, nonstop, blocka block, bloodclaat
Don't test the lion 'cause you'll get dropped, on the spot
Lick shot, dread drop on the soil
Pot hot 'til it boil, to this crip shit I'm loyal
Dip with us, ride with us, slide with us, slip with us
Sit with us, sick with us, bad lil' bitch wanna get with us
Said she like to french tipped, nails that I wear
And how I'm so pimped out with dreads in my hair
Yeah! You got proof, now the truth is to dare
Blue bandana, it's me and Montana
At the Tropicana, with Tenisha, Alicia
LaKeisha, Savannah, nicknames for my blammer

[Chorus: Mavado]
I got my gun on me! I tell my kids I ain't never leave dem lonely!
Fuckin streets on me! Deathrow Jamaicans, murda yuh family!
Fuck what happens tonight! Fuck what happens tonight!
Fuck what happens tonight! I got my gun on me!

[Verse Four: Scarface]
The smell of blood in the bathroom, body laid out stiff full of stab wounds
I told this nigga I was comin back
Pussy must've not have heard me when I told him that
Nigga it's eye for an eye
A life for a life, a body for a price
I wanna smell his last breath took
And look him in his eyes and make for sure he knows how death looks
'Cause I'm him, it's in the air I can feel it
Shot him four times with the gun I was concealin
Overkillin, there ain't no comin back from it
Then walked away with the demeanor like I just done it
Somethin evil this way comin
For big faced hundreds, this bitch gets punished!

[Chorus: Mavado]
I got my gun on me! I tell my kids I ain't never leave dem lonely!
Fuckin streets on me! Deathrow Jamaicans, murda yuh family!
Fuck what happens tonight! Fuck what happens tonight!
Fuck what happens tonight! I got my gun on me!
