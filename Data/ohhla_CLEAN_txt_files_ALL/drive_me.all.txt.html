[Chorus: Allah Real]
Girl, drive me crazy, drive me crazy
So crazy, girl, you drive me crazy, drive me crazy
So crazy, girl, you drive me crazy, drive me crazy
So crazy, girl, you drive me crazy...

[Allah Real]
You came to stop by, and it was a big suprise
I said girl what's on your mind, now tell what's up
The day before, and you didn't wanna call
I want nothing of it at all, now I see you love me

[Chorus]

[Allah Real]
One other thing that you did, didn't mean the pain
So you thought that you could play me, girl, it's not fooling
Girls take this time, to come to realize
Your always on my mind, my love, it's driving me crazy

[Chorus]

[Allah Real]
Oh, oh...
I'm looking at what was all of that
You don't know what you do to me, it's driving me crazy
So let's time, be real, what's on your mind
The worst thing that could happen, girl, is you expressing your feelings
So now you know, tell me where this goes
For you to understand my love, you think I'm just crazy

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
