What's up nigga, you think I give a fuck nigga what
What huh, I don't give a fuck nigga this thug shit nigga
Motherfucking soldier music nigga
How you niggaz love it nigga, the motherfucking black Bill Gates nigga
What what what, get hype in this motherfucker nigga
Throw them motherfucking rags up

[Hook - 2x]
This is for my real niggaz, don't give a fuck with me
Put your rags in the air, nigga buck with me
This is for my real niggaz, don't give a fuck with me
Put your K's in the air, nigga buck witth me

[Krazy]
I still slang coke, so them fed's trail me
Jealous bitches, anxious to nail me
I'm the nigga that they looking for, on the news
Murder conspiracy, I ain't got shit to lose
My click spilling kerosene, dope and weed
Fuck with me, bitch I promise I'll make you bleed what you need
My whole block is dope fiends, and come catch us
Niggaz die from head shots, laying on stretchers
Ain't nothing but a I Reveal, cotton type thugs
Niggaz want my drama, but scared of my slugs
I been doing this many years, busting triggers
This is dedicated, to my real ass niggaz

[Hook - 2x]

[Slay Sean]
To all my niggaz still in spots, slanging them rocks
It don't stop, two niggaz inside but watching for cops
Getting they choke on, in other words getting they smoke on
You know just trying to kill time, until the coke gone
Repping they hood, with big shit like Clint Eastwood
Clapping niggaz ery'day, and still they good
Reading picks, slanging for hours changing shifts
Just sitting in a room all day, making licks
Watching flicks, with rocks in a watch that's sick
Popping shit, only busting glocks that spit
We got this shit, came and locked this shit
Slay and Krazy come on dog, we rock this shit

[Hook - 2x]

[Krazy]
Are you ready to be a breeder, with the game
Whodie, I let this AK rang
To a nigga'z fucking face, hold up
On the ground with your body, swolled up
These scholars wanna test my nuts, I let em hang
Fifty shots on that ass, I let em sang
These fake niggaz don't want, no trouble
These lil' boys need to learn, how to hustle
Whodie wanna slang coke, but can't rock up
I got that china white, tear the block up
And I still get loaded, fuck that shit
Off coke, dope or whatever I can get now</pre>
