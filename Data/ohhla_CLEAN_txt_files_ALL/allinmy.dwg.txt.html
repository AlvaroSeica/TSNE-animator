[White Dawg]
Now I remember when
I ain't had no ends
had no blades
had no Benz
no royal checks
no women to sex
no gold Rolex
no big body Lex
now I'm a baller
big money playa
you see me in the limousine navigator
sipping Don P it's kind of funny
how all these ladies
want me for my money..

Chorus

All off in my gold grill (why you in my grill?)
No, I won't pay your bills (I wont pay your bills)
Never have never will (never will never will never..)
Cuz a playa got to live.. (I got to.. live)

I tried approach you
but you was so rude
you and friend
both had an attitude
I said "hello"
you said "hell no"
y'all have been watching too many TLC videos
get out my girl
and that's real
I ain't Destiny's Child tryna pay your bills
never have never will
I'm just a superstar shining like my gold grill

All off in my gold grill (why you in my grill?)
No, I won't pay your bills (I wont pay your bills)
Never have never will (never will never will never..)
Cuz a playa got to live.. (I got to.. live)

[White Dawg]
I want you ladies to listen
we ain't supporting your pigeons
you used to call us some scrubs
but now we don't show you no love

[Journey]
we just sitting on some dubs
smoking care reminiscing
how you ladies used to diss us
before we started pimping

[White Dawg]
you want my dough (my dough)
I say hell no (hell no)
you hit the door (hit the door)
and that's for sho (that's for sho)
(4x)

All off in my gold grill (why you in my grill?)
No, I won't pay your bills (I wont pay your bills)
Never have never will (never will never will never..)
Cuz a playa got to live.. (I got to.. live)

Journey Montana, 
the boy that's quick to hit you off wit the down south grammar
straight out the M-I-A the 3-0-5 burning the slammer
I could recall remember the days they wouldn't give me no play
look at the way the story changed all
now the ?? got to pay to play
and everyday they see me ??
wit the windows beating the funk out
and all the hoes got beef cuz they my baby mama all toked out
wit the diamonds and x and o
for the tricks don't know that's hugs and kisses
pulling up on the scene in a ?? we still got riches
flipping the switches for them skanks
they call me all types of scrubs and suckers
much love of the brothers
that got back on them tricks and calling them busters
and pigeons its girls like that's making this pimping a religion
me and my homey White Dawg tryna put one up for fellas now listen
stop tripping and paying them sluts
got them thinking they supposed to get bucks
when the reality of it is you ain't even supposed to be giving a ...
now we end it on this note with the last and final quote Sadie
White Dawg and Journey who say it's all gravy baby..

All off in my gold grill (why you in my grill?)
No, I won't pay your bills (I wont pay your bills)
Never have never will (never will never will never..)
Cuz a playa got to live.. (I got to.. live)

All off in my gold grill (why you in my grill?)
No, I won't pay your bills (I wont pay your bills)
Never have never will (never will never will never..)
Cuz a playa got to live.. (I got to.. live)</pre>
