[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Yo, you see me? (You see me?)
Yeah I see you (Yeah, I see you man)
You see me, trash? I see you
L.O.B., yeah, he's back ya'll!
You see me? I see you, yeah man!
Yeah, whoo, that's what B.E. is

[Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, the kid got it cooking in here, ya'll niggas recognize
The kid L.O.B., as if Brooklyn was here
And where I rep, it ain't no faggot dogs with hooks in their ear
Straight cats who grind out and make the book of the year
Staten Island, watch me kill it for ya'll, throw ya hands up
Bust ya guns twice, watch me kill it for ya'll
And I'm fucked up with no dough, plus I got no deal
I'm right there where them live niggas park they wheels
Fuck sidewalk money, I want the street cake
You damn right I'm gonna be there when the streets paint
Don't forgot your tooly, I know some sick moolies
And by the way, I need some numbers to some new groupies
Here's the ecst' pills, now how the tech feel?
You damn right, the kid coming just to test the grill
On some checkmate, I got the hood copper
Hood stopper, hood dropper, black talent
Wild man, L.O.B.E., steal ya riches
When you, spot on me, you be like "they're the bitches"
And not no niggas, who can't get along
Everybody, just sing this song

[Chorus: Lounge Lo]
My on the run niggas, having fun niggas, holding down, big gun niggas
And all my booster bitches, straight, shoot ya bitches, you know we used to bitches
And all them jails, and all them cells, and all them bails
Fuck the cops, I touch the cops, one shot, bust the cops

[Lounge Lo]
I put a hush through ya scenery, big boy
Diddy bop down ya block with the space shack leaning me
Tough cookie, the new comer, the new rookie
No diploma, and I always love to play hooky
Short cuts to the house, where the cracks at
Open ya mouth, and that's where my gats at
Niggas is finished, come in the hood
Talk to me, bring me out, and give me a minute
I'mma shine regardless, muthafuckin' favorite artist
I'd rather save it, and do it face to face
And when it's done, you damn right, I'mma do it for Kase
And the world on the block is that they riffin' again
You know that kid L.O.B., still shitting again
Break my gun down in twenty seconds, I hear a loud noise
Reload my weapon, and then call my child boys
I got a force like Tarshia birth
And I'mma trynna be easy, but the harsh'll hurt
And I never did tell ya where Tarshia work
But if I, get in some shit, then I park and murk
How the fuck you gonna stop my work? Yo, it's B.Z.
And muthafucka, I'mma dart ya shart

[Chorus]</pre>
