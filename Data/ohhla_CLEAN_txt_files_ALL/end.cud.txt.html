[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
I'll never do it again
Do it again.. I'll never do it again
Cause this is the end
This is the end.. this is the end

[repeat Chorus 0.75X]

[GLC - over Chorus repeat at first]
Ayyy!
Ay, ay
My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been G, focus where you tryin to go
I swear the game make you cold like Abominable
Snowman, old man, when you tryin to shine like gold
When it's my time to blow, partner I'ma know
In the midst of gettin dough, I was hit with highs and lows
My mellow tried to play me, like my fuckin eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin here, wishin that my guys didn't know
They love a G, so they despise his soul
What they gon' do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is tryin to grow
He'd be Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito
and Pachenga so I'm watchin every angle
Under the moonlight with the devil I tangle
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control of money is better control of anger
So now I watch a friend the way that I watch a stranger
(Chuuch!)

[Chorus] - 2X

[Chip Tha Rapper]
Uhh~! Chillin, rollin up somethin to change my feelin
Thinkin about how I came up from nothin while I'm splittin
this Cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dawgs trippin hard, talkin 'bout runnin and killin 'em all
I say "Slow down, slow down, what you the fuck you mean?
Niggaz just ran in yo' crib and popped yo' daughter in the spleen?
I'll be there in 20 minutes," but it only took 15
We wasn't that tight, but cool enough for me to hit the scene
I didn't know that this was all a setup, secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They fastest move was too slow for me
I pulled up; wasn't no ambulance and wasn't no police
Somethin fishy goin on, naive kept pressin on
Nine gripped thinkin the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front do', they shot, I shot, someone dropped shit
The nigga with somethin to lose just almost lost it
Won't trust him again

[Chorus] - 2X

[Kid Cudi]
Cheese came through at 3, salute at ease
He had supplied the weed cause I'd been that OD
It's me with the black rock star steez
Real rock tees, three hundred a pop for these
Please~! Bummy, you don't know me money
"Day 'n' Nite" got flipped, and I got blow for a grip
Sippin on a Heiny with my Jamie boo beside me
That's my fuckin best friend, when I'm tweakin she be calmin a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I'm so damn comfortable, I never want to leave it
The feeling, is somethin like the spiritual healer
that could end me, I think that's part I find intriguing
A little bit off I am, I am, I am
I see that I'm caught I am, I am, I am
It's somethin like the spiritual healer that could end me
I think that's part I find intriguing, I'm fiending

[Nicole Wray]
I'll never do it again</pre>
