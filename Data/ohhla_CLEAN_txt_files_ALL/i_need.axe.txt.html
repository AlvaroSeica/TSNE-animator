[Long Axe]
It's the vision in the words
The time in which you live in is the wind within the verb
The pimp up in the park
That left the game hanging for the women in his heart
The wino on the tracks
He can hear the train coming but he's never looking back
The bullet out your gun
The shorty with the headphones on that didn't run
The old man sitting by the young man
Living in his own damn prison
The bottled up Hell
Player shots get followed up, but oh well
The cage and the dove
With AIDS in the blood we afraid to make love
The smile is a frown
When you struggling, feeling like you upside down
The poet and the crook
One can write about it well, the other takes the book
The Bible and Quran
Holy wars coming and its summon is Saddam
The music in the soul
If you take away the drums you can hear it dying slow
The father and the son
Tryna take me past zero, can't you see that we are one
The money and the problems
Everybody's hungry, can't reach them when they starving
Graffiti in the trains
We break and stick together, can't you see it's all the same
The dreams and the passion
The means is the theme and it's all about lasting
The journey and the steps
Moving in directions that you haven't gone yet
The beginning and the end
Living in the middle takes very hard skin
Being black, being open
Being anything you that want via emotion</pre>
