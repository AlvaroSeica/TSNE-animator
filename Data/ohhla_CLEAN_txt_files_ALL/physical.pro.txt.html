[Intro: Prodigal Sunn]
Yeah, Sunzini the Great
S.O.M., Two On Da Road

[Chorus: Prodigal Sunn]
Features in the crowd, appearance light black, I'm proud
Background, no sound, four pound, we hold it down
Yeah, Brooklyn, we hold it down
Brooklyn, we hold it down

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yo, home of the villain, 'nuff blood spilling, crab niggas out for the killing
With a half a mill, yo, cop me a couple of buildings
Son, I do it for my family, plus I can't
Stand an M.C., that, can't stand me
I blaze a whole tree, this be that P.S. shit
That B.B.S. shit, come try test this boy, forget it
Or regret it, I pretended runs with no edits
Do a nice symetric breath control and calestetics
Keep a solid reign, bitches scream my name
Prodi', my eyes red from the hydrolic
To keep them records spinning to ending, stop pretending
Drop a Def Jam slam like Russell Simmons
Came in always in my Timberlands
Rock a Sunz of Man emblem, black rim
Remember them, blew at the same time as Lil' Kim
Spit a little phlim, still shop at V.I.M.

[Chorus]

[Prodigal Sunn]
Ain't no, stopping me now, stopping me, how
I'm on the rise to the top, cream of the crop
Ya'll rappers need to stop hip hop
Lame ass niggas with prop, for real yo
Ya'll niggas dildo's, worse than cops
Who wanna set it, bring it, who will be the first to drop
Get bossed like hopskotch, top notch, red on the rocks
Through the city 'ock, uncut raw, shitty and poor
Gritty at war, bitch niggas envy us more
Temper's raw, now you assed out, flat face on the floor
That's what ya'll muthafuckas get for chasing them whores
The annihilator, the violator, breaking laws, breaking jaws
Taking tour money, you stole my whole style sunny
Ain't nothing funny, I leave ya'll stiff like some dummies
All ya'll smelt was the honey, backwood, twist a gummy
I stay hungry, plus I eat amongst the bummy
The grummy, please be lucky, we got 'em
Son, I spell release, split a thief, brick raise heat
Ya'll niggas don't want no beef

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
