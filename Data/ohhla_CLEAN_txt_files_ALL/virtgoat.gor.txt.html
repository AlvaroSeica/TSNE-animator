[Ill Bill]
2025 alive solar powered nines
hard times
sometimes I'm surprised the worlds even survived
a world of weapons
a world of deception
technological tension
I take drugs to forget
freedom of expression
I'd rather not dwell on evil intentions
I'd rather fuck a hologram
Fuck with these evil inventions

Remember when porn was one dimensional?
Evil angels will implant images in your brain to have sex with you
The girl of your choice
Fuck an interactive menu
Pop a pill to trigger the system implanted in you
A simple operation redefining the term go fuck yourself;
In a simple conversation I see
Model religion collapse under money and machines
God is the remote control in your laptop computer screen
Computer worship
Make you lose it and shoot a person
