[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa] + (Snoop)
I'm smokin everywhere I go
(No sticks, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)
I'm blowin every gram I own
(That purp', that bomb, that kush~!)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that good, that good, that

[Snoop Dogg]
Concentrated, every day I'm faded
Trees prepared and properly cultivated
I nursed them, sprayed down, no chemi-cals
Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now?
Never treat you wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We +Up in Smoke+, makin street schemes
Smokin sticky green, havin sweet dreams
Break it down, put it in a Z-I zag
And pour the top back, and let the ass drag
Hit the switch, quickest way to get a beitch
Executive branch, get a whiff of this
Black car, sack of dank
High school, nigga what the fuck you think?
I'm passin all my classes with flyin colors
And every day I'm high as a motherfucker

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, uhh
Sunroof open, smokin while I'm rollin
My bitches only notice it if it's potent
Bottle of Perignon we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs; joint roaches and ashes all in your bed
You callin her babe, she call me instead
cause I put that game all in her head
Saw the crib, she know that I'm ballin
When he ain't have nothin they used to stall him
Now I'm with the Boss Dogg, all the bad hoes want him
And my pockets on swole, I'm talkin Rick Ross big
Now when we shop we don't care what the cost is
Rollin up good, smokin that bomb shit
Blow a whole O-Z nigga that's boss shit
Now she alllll "fuck her man," rubberbands in my pocket
Get money, goin hard for my profit
Bad bitch keep a joint stuffed like stockings
Young nigga out here gettin bread, why knock it?
Hahaha, yeah

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
We welcome you to high school
We do just what we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up and get high to it
We welcome you to high school
We do just what we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up and get high to it
Get high to it, yea

[Chorus]</pre>
