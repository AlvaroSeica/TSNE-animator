[Intro: Red Cafe]
WHAT ELSE?!!!

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie] (Red Cafe)
So when I fly, you fly, we fly together (HUH!!!!)
And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever (SHAKEDOWN!!!)
Oh Yeah!!!

[Verse One: Red Cafe] (Red Cafe)
Yeah! I'm a boss so I need a boss chick
And we could boss up like the bosses (BOSS!)
All about green like Paul Pierce (YEAH!)
Mayweather flow look zero losses (HUH!!!)
Dime in the day (Yep!) Diamond at night (Yep!)
Five star chick 'bout that five star life (HA!)
I must admit I'm a fan
Your shoe game ruthless girl god damn!
Been a few years, your my number one
Blood in my vein (Yep!) Breath in my lungs (Yep!)
We the ones winnin, so they wanna toast
We a item blend like Rum, Coke
Love the way you doin it, keep doin it
Then, fly like a Jet Blue stewardess 
You could fly alone, but I don't advise it
I'm invitin you, so fly with the pilot

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie] (Red Cafe)
So when I fly, you fly, we fly together (BELIEVE THAT!!!!)
And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever, baby  (YEAH!!!)
So when I fly, you fly, we fly together (HUH!!!!)
And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever (BAD BOY!!!)
Oh Yeah!!! (*M-M-MAYBACH MUSIC)

[Verse Two: Rick Ross]
{M-M-M-M-Maybach Music} HUH! She wanna hit me on that I-Chat
On that I-Pad flyer than a sky cap
Shorty got a nice job, but works too hard
Put that shit tomorrow now welcome to the mall
I need my women mogul, I make the picture mogul
Double MG is global {M-M-M-M-Maybach Music} Still ride or role for dolo
I ain't rockin no Polo, but I'm drippin this shine
Her heart beatin so fast, 'cause I'm takin my time
Yeah I get it and lick it, I just handle my business
School of the VS1's, national or no difference
In my Bentley just dippin, I keep her by my side
My life a runway, and It's time to fly

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie] (Red Cafe)
So when I fly, you fly, we fly together (BELIEVE THAT!!!!)
And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever, baby  (YEAH!!!) (WHAT ELSE!!!)
So when I fly, you fly, we fly together (HUH!!!!)
And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever
Oh Yeah!!!

[Verse Three: Red Cafe]
Yeah! Yeah! I'm a boss so I need a boss chick (HA!!!)
And we could play house in my fortress (HUH!!!)
Feet kicked up corner office (Yeah!)
Royalty princess in my crosses
She wanna tear the mall down well I let her do
Hear go my credit cards (Yep!) And the debit too (Yep!)
I like your attitude (Ha!) Guess I'm supposed to
See you on Facebook (What's up?) So I post you (What Else?!!!)
HA!!! Biggest couple on campus
Stylin on 'em all ever since prom dances (Damn!)
Me and my boo, you know how I do
Toss keys to valet on arrival
HA!!! We in here like a hostage
Your my better half in that full length Ostrich
Any time you fall through it's a blood bath
Swag killin them hoes now leave your autograph 

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie] (Red Cafe)
So when I fly, you fly, we fly together (BELIEVE THAT!!!!)
And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever, baby  (YEAH!!!) (WHAT ELSE!!!)
So when I fly, you fly, we fly together (HUH!!!!)
And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever
Oh Yeah!!!

[Bridge: Ryan Leslie]
There, ain't, no, stoppin, by your side I will fly
Let's, go, house, shoppin, and the one you like I will buy
I'll, be, your, superhero, you'll be my Wonder Woman baby!
Let's fly together, oh my!!!!!

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie] 
So when I fly, you fly, we fly together 
And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever, baby 
So when I fly, you fly, we fly together 
And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever
Oh Yeah!!!

[Outro: Ryan Leslie]
I care for how we leavin, until the sky we reachin
We can f-fly together baby
We'll fly, we'll fly togther baby
I care for how we leavin, until the sky we reachin
We can f-fly together baby
We'll fly, we'll fly togther baby

[Outro: Red Cafe]

If not me then who?
Your address is now cloud nine
Believe that!</pre>
