Shh...

4 3 2 1
What we fighting...?
4 3 2 1
I don't know what...
4 3 2 1
What we fighting...?
4 3 2 1
I don't know what for

Clap your hands, everybody
Don't act like you never saw me
Just clap your hands, everybody
Everybody, clap your hands

Clap your hands, everybody
Don't act like you never saw me
Just clap your hands, everybody
And everybody, clap your hands
OK

You say hello
I say goodbye
Don't leave me high
Or post to dry
Feels so good
When you're by my side
Check like Johnny Depp
Playing the role of a fly guy
Whatever
I thought together
We're tougher than leather
And never
Fall for the pleasure
Under pressure
But it seems
All that glitters is gold
Maybe you sold your soul
For the golden goose
But the truth is
Long as I keep rhyming
Eyes keep shining
Soul stays divine
I remember
'96, we used to dance
I had two pairs of pants
But you had that glance, yo
Used to hang out
In the park and just chill
Now we sweep swords
In the dark and act ill
Doesn't really matter
I've got to go
Peace to maestros
That rock for sho'
We did it

4 3 2 1
What we fighting...?
4 3 2 1
I don't know what...
4 3 2 1
What we fighting...?
4 3 2 1
I don't know what for

Guess who's back
That never left at all?
With the brand new pencil
And a crystal ball
Let it fall
Summertime
Break down the wall
You can't give what
You haven't conceived at all
It's the truth, foolproof
But fools need proof
So I slide to the side
And I act uncouth
But it's just an act
'Cause I might react
To those who never
Held a mic that fed back
Listen
It's just a day in the life
Of a man living in the dark
One headlight
Wake up to Dylan
The village makes the villain
I write raps while I watch
Myself on the ceiling
4 3 2 1
It's a countdown
I roll like a laser beam
Through the downtown
Its mind over matter
Maintain the globe
Peace to Metric
LJ, oh

4 3 2 1
What we fighting...?
4 3 2 1
I don't know what...
4 3 2 1
What we fighting...?
4 3 2 1
I don't know what for

What for, what for
What for, what for
What for

Clap your hands, everybody
Don't act like you never saw me
Just clap your hands, everybody
Everybody, clap your hands

Clap your hands, everybody
Don't act like you never saw me
Just clap your hands, everybody
Everybody, clap your hands</pre>
