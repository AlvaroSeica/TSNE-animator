(Lil' Rob)
I want you to sit back, close your eyes
And think about all those wonderful times that we used to have here
Now I know things aren't the way they use to be right now
But they are going to get better some day
And I know that...

(Lil' Rob)
Ever since I was about 12 that's when they documented me
A gang member let me tell you my autobiography
Ay I can't let it to be frenetic, it must have been genetic
To get in trouble with the law take when I break
I'm strapped from the balls that's what I use to do
Smoking a joint or two Lil' Rob getting a little blaze
Welcome to my concrete maze, remember the days
I remember going to school, we meet by the track smoking a sack
With the vato I sold it too, get him stoned
Then I jack it back, remember the guero use to look at us all
Funny and strange, cause my pants was bigger then theirs
But now they all wear them the same
I used to get jealous, wondering why I didn't have the same rights
Is it because I'm running up and down, eating Menudo, frijoles and rice?
Someone explain to me, all of this insanity
I'm not understanding you, never understanding me
When a minority, gets their priorities straight
We become the majority, inflate
Incredible rate, controlling our fate
Controlling our states, and I can't wait
Remember you told me I would never amount to anything
That I'll probably be on the streets sellin mota or methamphetamines
So what? It made me an extra buck when I was shit outta my life
You'd do the same thing homie if you were stuck

(Lil' Rob)(Chorus)
And I remember, when times was easy
That's what everybody says
But not me, wicked ass times on S.D. streets
But I still loved them (But I still love them)
And had to have them. (And had to have them)

And I remember! (Remember x3)
Remembering the things we used to do
The places we used to go

(Lil' Rob)
And I remember kicking under the street lamps, smokin a J
Hearing my Homie say, Homie pass the joint this way
And this was everyday and every night was the same
We didn't call each other by our first or last, but by nicknames
Dreamer, Peewee, Oso Negro to name a few
One passed away, rest in peace
The others locked away in prison blues
One of the things we use to do
Can't nobody take it away from us
We used to live life dangerous, time flew away like angel dust
Never known as presentado levas
Stay away from metiches, and chepas
Talking mentiras, cause they can't beat us
Mira Lil' Rob on his lowrider bicicleta
Looking for mu√±ecas, beautiful like aztecas
But when it comes to love, before the agony for the ecstacy
What comes around goes around
So baby don't mess with me don't be testing me
Cause Lil' Rob be one of a kind original individual
Unforgettable memorable indelible incredible inferable

(Chorus)

(Lil' Rob)
Give all of my love to mi madre padre brother and sister
And all of my sangre
Enemies? Chale me vale verga estas afuera mirando padentro
You wanna come in but you can't
Cause we're not in love with no mensos
Figuring it out like a pencil
Treat one like a stencil
Just when you think you've got a grip on life
That's when you let go, ready set go
It's a race to the finish and only the best gonna win this
And I'm prepared to take it to outer limits or until it's finished business
What is this? Gente becoming witnesses
I don't know nothing, I don't hear nothing, I don't see nothing
Something I learned as a kid
Along with respect those who respect you
Forget about the ones that will forget about you
My recollection is a collection of a big section of mi vida
Memories I need ya, like a junky needs his chiba
I wish that I could go back and do it all over again
But I know that that ain't happening, so I sit remembering 

(Chorus)</pre>
