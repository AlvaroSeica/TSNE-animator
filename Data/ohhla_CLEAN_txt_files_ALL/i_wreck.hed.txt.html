Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook - 2x]
I wreck shop, but I'm a nigga out the Ness
I'm real with mine, I'll put a hoe to the test
It's Big Bee, and bitch I'm not for play
I make niggaz lay it down, when they get in my way

[Big Bee]
Step in execution style, murder
I have no remorse, cause I'm the hater hurter
I don't play games, with you bitch ass niggaz
That's coming from the 300 pound, grave digger
I got the big gun, that'll tear up the den
Split your elbow, and crack your shin
It's young Pap Daddy, with this mafia style
If you catch the square nigga, I'll damage your smile
Big B-double E, wreck shop
Street sweep your whole block, and make twelve hearts stop
With my automatic gat, that I use for combat
Most valuable thug, just peep the street stats
I'm known to shoot shots, that infect the chest
Put holes in your back, and make big mama stress
I'm hard on a nigga, that tries to cheat me
I'm a one man army, I'm all I can be

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Bee]
I feel a woof coming on, like Mafioso
I'm so fa sho, I'll tag your big toe
And turn your body cold, with the blink of an eye
Big Bee ready for war, so what you think of me now
It get fatal when I'm hated, by faggots in desquise
Hard knocking and body rocking, so I'm cocking my nine
That release hot shots, that will shatter your spine
Splatter your mind, I insist you drop that on a dime
I can't stand bitch made niggaz, switch blade niggaz
I'm trigga happy, trying to be a rich made nigga
I spray K's, and I'm out the Ness
Call the coroner, and tell him to come mop up the mess
Nigga who that man, who that talking down
You gon feel the wrath, with seventeen rounds
I'm a heavyweight bitch, I go pound for pound
And my feddy straight, I can go round for round

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Bee]
I'm bone hard out the South, and I cause trouble
I'm like a pit bull, that you have to muzzle
Raise the white flag, and respect my name
If you don't, you gon feel some third degree pain
My hands hit hard, but my gun's the best
Cause when I whoop your ass hoe, you gon run for your tech
And I'ma lay your ass down, like a floor mat
And make sho, that you hit the road Jack bitch
I put hoes in check, when they knock my grind
Fucked your gal down, cause you got out of line
For showing me, all that disrespect
I'ma torment you, with reptiles and insects
Playa hater fuck you, you can suck my dick
And make a big nigga rich, you niggaz is cake mix
And counterfeit, so please don't push me to the limit
I'ma keep this shit gangsta, till the finish bitch
