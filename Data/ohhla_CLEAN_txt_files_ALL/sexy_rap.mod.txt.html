[Eric Singleton]
Have you ever had somebody that you loved?
That you really cared about?
And she was so damn sexy?
Made you go crazy?
Made you wanna do anything?
Come on!

Every man wants to have you it's plain to see,
So I must be lucky that you're here with me
Like, one, two, three, pick up the phone come by
She's so damn sexy, made a grown man cry
Don't need to lie, if I just had a taste
The way you dance, the way you move your waist
There can never be another, that really amaze me
Drive me crazy, Miss Sexy Lady!

[Modern Talking]
My sexy, sexy lover, oh tell me there's no other
Tell me there's no other, deep in your heart
My sexy, sexy lover, I wanna be your cover
There's no other, who's breaking apart

Oh my sexy little lover, swear there is no other
I feel alone, when I'm coming home
Oh, my sexy little lover, tell me there's no other
Just when I'm down, need you all around

[Eric Singleton]
Sexy, sexy, sexy lover!
A lover
Sexy
Sexy lover
What we're gonna do right here is go back

Can all the pretty woman make me feel so nice?
Need you in my life, both day and night
The champagne is on ice, make a toast of love
Cause you're the only one I'm thinkin of
To all the starts above shine down from heaven
From one to ten, all the skill, you're eleven
Five days to seven, you really amaze me
Ain't nobody like Sexy Lady

[Modern Talking]
My sexy, sexy lover, oh tell me there's no other
Tell me there's no other deep in your heart
My sexy, sexy lover, I wanna be your cover
There's no other, who's breaking apart

Oh my sexy little lover, swear there is no other
I feel alone, when I'm coming home
Oh, my sexy little lover, tell me there's no other
Just when I'm down, need you all around

My sexy, sexy lover, I wanna be your cover
There's no other, who's breaking apart
My sexy, sexy lover, I wanna be your cover
There's no other, who's breaking apart

Oh my sexy little lover, swear there is no other
I'll feel alone, when I'm coming home
Oh, my sexy little lover, tell me there's no other
Just when I'm down, need you all around

[Eric Singleton]
Party up, party up, yo!
The only sexiest lady in the whole wide world!
Let's have SEX!
Is this a dream? </pre>
