[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Give me that, let's go, I wanna talk to ya
Team tag, you in boy, my dudes, come home with me
That's what's up, uh-huh

[Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, my peoples all over the world, they always ask me
Don't you rock with Wu, and you ain't on? You nasty
I tell 'em to chill, my tongue game classy
And for the record, they left me right in the Hill with Lassie
And even my brother, he started to act flashy
It took him some odd years, to make kid happy
I did what I did, departed from Slashy
But I still run with cats, that'll pop for that cash, B.
It's Staten Island to the fullest, muthafucka
And Deck must of forgot we transact' the undercovers
Bust shots in the Port, fuck fiends up all day
All coofed up in the hallway, yo, it's me
L.O.B., the one you hung wit all day
And Meth, where you at? Remember the raw yae?
And all them damn trips to Broadway, sleepless nights
We in the hood, on Cleve, with no lights
And the slang that I drop, it's like feeding you right
Meaning to say, Power told Rae to be this type
Come on, Rae left the hood, where he breeded his life
He came back with the Lexxy Diamonds, did "Hood" in the hood
And he told me that he was back to grinding
Around the same time U-G-O-D was bugging
He called Hot 97, said RZA was fronting
But RZA called back and said "You ain't nothing
It was the Clan that gave you love, and put you right on something
But we can get it right, let's get together tonight
And do a joint so fly, Funk Flex'll like
And throw a bomb like the wreckless type", It's Staten Island
And we black like Wesley Snipes

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Yo, we gon' walk one more time, come home my dudes
Ya'll know what it is... I love ya'll niggas, man
Just give me some love back, man
Slashy, I see you, man... niggas can't break the link, boy
Regardless to situations, man
Them muthafuckas know what I do, they know what I'm about
And they know where I rep, man...
Holla at your peoples, the Stones, we home
Brim, I see you... Smoke, I see you...
Killa K, I see you, Wigs, yessa yessa my lords
We back... Dirty Island, peace...</pre>
