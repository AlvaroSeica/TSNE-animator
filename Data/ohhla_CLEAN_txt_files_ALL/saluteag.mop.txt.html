[Intro]
Uhh, what? Uhh, uhh
GET, THE, FUCK, UP!

[Chorus: Lil' Fame]
SALUTE A G WHEN YOU SEE ONE
Put fo' fingers up to ya fo'head, and tuck in ya thumb
SALUTE A G WHEN YOU SEE ONE
Put fo' fingers up to ya fo'head, and tuck in ya thumb
SALUTE A G WHEN YOU SEE ONE
Put fo' fingers up to ya fo'head, and tuck in ya thumb
HOLLA AT ME - salute! HOLLA BACK - salute!
CLACK CLACK - salute! SHOW LOVE TO A G

[Lil' Fame]
It's poppin off in this bitch, it's the chairman of the board in this bitch
(FIZZY WO'!) Boss Hog in this bitch
Yo I know a couple of Bloods, I know a couple of Crips
And they don't C-Walk, all them niggaz do is this...
... blow smoke up in the air
Fuck your bottle, put your cups in the air
Nigga you bitch born breech, you walked out your moms
Don't make me.. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK YOU UP!
It's gym star fucker, that's what they call me now
I got a cut for these hoes still wanna blow me down
(So nigga keep your hoes in they place)
Everyday's a holiday, but you know I brought my hammer just in case
Cause we police the hood, cops show no purpose on the block
Why the fuck they keep circlin the block?
They can't stop the thugs, they can't stop the love of the music
Tell them motherfuckers salute me

[Chorus]

[Billy Danze]
Yeah, yeah
It's as rugged as you can get it nigga (IT'S) the legends of war
(M.O.P.!) You niggaz'll get levelled for sure
You know me (B.D.) I spit shine the flow
Stuck, back in the cut and took time to glow
So I'm still on the beat, I mean walkin the beat
Down in the street where the killers compete
And make 'em holla MAN DOWN..
Commander Danze with a hand cannon, standin on dangerous grounds
(EASE UP!) Get up off me nigga
Don't get grease in your peez and let fathers figure
Cross me! C'mon, follow through wit'cha schemes
And I'll open one of you motherfuckers up at the seams
FIYAHHHHHH! Crucial conflict
A real G policy is no nonsense
Go 'head nigga, take your hammer in the house
'fore I beat all your teeth out your God damn mouth!

[Chorus]</pre>
