[CHORUS]
Cook up like a dough boy
Smellin like fahrenheit
Motherfucker whatcha gunna do

[Koopsta Knicca]
since ya' niggas from the ville
they got to fuck me just get em mane
Fuckin with that 6 double 6
Its gunna be a fright night
Paul is making nigga knocking
Point that glock at them bitches faces
Know Koopsta plays that Koopsta Knicca
Gone on a motherfuckin rampage
Kicking with that 9 in hand
Lets make this to another stance
Scarecrow with that satanic bible
Tell me where's the killa man
(edited) God lets take this on another ride
Juicy with that tech 9 lets turn this to a homicide
666 now burning shit lets make this to a crucifix
Chopped up in a fucking ditch
We clickin like Jeffery Domer's bitch
Bitch in my yard
Is where your body be well exposed
Its 6 double 6 mafia clicks slanging
Listen ya funking hoes
Ya scared ya scared
Because I dwell with that evil dead
I bled them bodies
I left the blood running in your bed
The koopsta's a pyscho nigga
You got a ?psy i am to? too
A glock to yo body fool
Now whatcha gunna do

[CHORUS]

[DJ PAUL]
Glocks
Tech 9's
Uzi's at yo motherfucking face
No fear
Quickly watch a fucking murder take place
Place me a trick in my guillotine
Chop his cock off and
See how fast we can make this mother scream
We means
No fuckin niceness when we around
My glock make this sound (gun shots)
When I buck down clowns
Funkytown cause you to be slippin
You be like trippin
And fallin under spells
Even by my demon tells me
How ya gunna get
With my 6 double 6 6 million 6 hundred and 60 thousand crazies
That i click with wickedness
I shoulda have test you
Before I let you down in my boat
But now I push you over to watch you struggle to stay afloat
We drop A rope straight around your throat
Lets see if he chokes
When I trip of this weed and
Put the ship in high speed
Always wanna have ya fuckin way like a hoe
This triple 6 shit don't stop
So what the fuck you gunna D-O
Trick ass nigga

[CHORUS UNTIL FADE]</pre>
