This is your captain once again. As we make our descent
into Los Angeles we hope you had a pleasant flight.
The weather conditions are clear blue skies at 126 degrees
and we'll be in the terminal in less than 30 seconds.
Once again thank you for flying Death Row West.

Y.G.D. (Pac's Voice)
When the Nine ball hits ya brain
ain't nothin' left on the ground
but a mothafuckin' blood stain
The return of the mothafuckin' riders
One deuce six Darkside Eastsidaz
Young G is a G with stamina
ask ya bitch how it felt when I was bammin' her
I'm in the streets but ridin' like I'm in jail
Death Row signed me 25 with a L (yeah nigga)
You know the Row got Cali' on lockdown (lockdown)
O.F.T.B. Y.G.D. &amp; tha Doggpound
Steppin' in the house for the Nine Eight
Young D about to set the fuckin' record straight
(set these niggas D)
Sucker suckin' on a lolipop lookin' cute
All the bitch nigga's missin' is a pink suit (gay ass niggas)
I'm feelin' good off the drink &amp; the Indo
Fuck Bad Boy nigga this is Death Row

They say they comin' back to Cali
but they ain't comin' back to Cali
They say they comin' back to Cali

They say they comin' back to Cali

Verse 2
Fe fi fo fum (ha ha haaa)

Lettin' niggas know it's a giant in the industry
(Tell 'em who you is young nigga) Y.G.D.
Suge Knight put a nigga on payroll
so you know I ain't gotta sell the fuckin' yayo (that's right nigga)
no more as I'm smokin' on Indo
in a brand new 500 Benzo (that's right)
They say D let's roll to the studio (yeah)
and drop a smash on these mothafuckin foolios (fuck these niggas)
I hear these fools gangsta hatin' on Makaveli (Pac)
sayin' Death Row is through oh nigga really?
You must not have heard about the brand new itinerary
(tell 'em about it)

If you ain't got yo' West Coast Death Row pass
(what we gon' do?)
you better leave town before we get yo' ass

Step to me I'll put this nine in ya spine (ha ha ha haaa)
Don't try to get me from behind let's go toe to toe
