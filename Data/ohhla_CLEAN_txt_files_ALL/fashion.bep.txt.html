[will.i.am]
Hey doctor, is somethin wrong with me?
Am I crazy do I need a remedy?
I'm a, club rocker that's my personality
It's in fashion to be bla-blastin them beats
And I like to go out every niiiiight
I like to go out every niiiiight
I like to go out every niiiiight
I like to go out and..

[Chorus: will.i.am + Fergie]
Dance dance to them beats beats beats (to the beat) {*repeat 3X*}
Rock rock to the beats beats beats (to the beat)
