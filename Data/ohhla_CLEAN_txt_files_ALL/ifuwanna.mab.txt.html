[Hook 1: Peaches - 2x]
If you wanna know, just how the story goes
From being in the sto's, to rocking every show
We be rolling tires, the Maab is on the rise
Trae and Dougie D, Guerilla Maab for life

[Hook 2]
Everybody get wired up, (cause me and my Maab be popped up)
We concrete bust no stopping us (we ride out, now we popular)
Everybody get wired up, (cause me and my Maab you could bounce with us)
We concrete no stopping us (hustling, AK's and choppers)

[Raw-D]
I'm a young nigga, ready for war
Cause I'm out chea, and I'm stepping with my hands on my weapon
No time for the women, cause they holding me down
But I'm ready to climb, slowed down whoa now
You can learn by fucking with us, cause I'ma swell up
Your face and detach your jaw, everybody wanna know
Gon come to a halt, talking all that shit we might cut you short
Cause I'm a thug nigga, with a gun and a beam
Running with the Guerilla Maab, niggas on my team
Mash for cream, trying to fulfill my dreams
With my mug on mean, you don't really wanna know me
I be the lil one, they call Raw-D
Brought up in the streets, in the P.U.D
You got beef with me, you better be about your issue
You can't stand the heat, get your ass out the kitchen
Me, Dougie D, Trae, K all on a mission
On a mission, all in the back of the Expedition
Me and my G's, we all be hitting
Coming through your hood, make you stop look and listen
Better cool your tensions, cause I might get violent
Some people yelling out, shh be quiet
Everybody in the club, just excited
I could fucking ride it, spark up a riot

[Hook 1 - 2x]

[Kendro]
If you wanna, you can ride out with me
Kendro, the lil' nigga that supply the heat
To put him on his back, and R.I.P
Boy looking at me, no order to leave
The mighty techs release, and cease the plex
Cooned out cat, certified the rest
Survive the game, and I squash the plex
In a black bullet proof, and I'm down to check
Instead I make my feddy, by the rock and the Houpe
That don't stay fly, I get fly too
Trying to hop out of line, put a nigga in his place
Serve up his chest, and swell up his face
We on a paper chase, bo'gaurd the block
And the block is hot, so I glock yacht
Phone the friends, I need the chopper
It's seventeen niggas, it's seventeen shots
Here to wreck on c.d.'s, in the seven seas
(I'm a Guerilla Maab thug), we South Klique G's
When I clear my pad, I'll make niggas all agg'd
Better tuck they tail, and dress just like drag
When I grab the mic, I make the whole crowd crunk
And pop the trunk, and everybody get bucked
Fin to let these boys, up on some game
On my last leg, and don't bite your fame

[Hook 1 - 2x]

[Hook 2]

[Trae]
Too many hating motherfuckers, steady be jocking me
Know what I claim, and ain't nobody fin to stop me
I'm one of the raw niggas, straight up out of the block
Staying ready to box, and staying strapped with a glock
One hell of a thug fuck love, I got a slug now bitch
I fuck around and kick this off, and I'ma hug me a bitch
24/7, and all my niggas ready to ride
Straight up bust heads, keeping the block bled
Niggas really don't, wanna be fucking with us
No time to be talking, I'm popping the trunk
With a pump, and I'ma spray
So if you do the wrong thang, you fin to get fucked up
And we the type of niggas, that'll be known to get bucked
And never let up, I don't plan on giving up for shit
With a click too thick, on the rise to get rich
Gotta get like Aaliyah, you better get it together
Before a nigga mess around, and get your whole click wet up

[Dougie D]
What the deal is, what go down
We making motherfuckers, walk the plank
And swanging hard at hoes, just like apes
Guerilla Maab 3D2, running over niggas in our way
You motherfuckers, better give up quick
'Fore a nigga commits your woman, that ass and the bitch clit
Digging all up in your shit, and got a motherfucker oh so sick
And hollin' what the deal is
Now that a nigga, popping up
Everybody wanna be in my face, Guerilla Maab we popular
Don't get it get crunk, wire it up with us
If you got your guns, all you niggas bust with us
Nigga look we thug niggas, Dougie D and Trae
Ken and Raw, we steady breaking hoes on off
Before you bitch niggas talk that shit, you better walk that shit
Dropping wide, up on the scene
