[Daddy Mac]
Aiyyo, here's the real scoop, homie loc
Dumb fools around my way gettin high off gun smoke
And I ain't talkin 'bout the high like indo
The kind of high that make you call ya kinfolks
And tell Moe "Johnny's dead"
A fo'teen-year-old kid put a nine to his head
All because he wanted that gear he was sportin... (yeah)
"Gimme dat, while you at it, gimme them Jordans"
Johnny tried to jet, homie wasn't hearin that
Johnny tried to run, got gatted in the back
Now tell me what happened to the way things used to be?
Cause at this rate, there'll be no future, G
When will all y'all learn..
that if you play with fire too long, you're bound to get burned
This ain't a small thing that I'm addressin
It's a big thing, take it from the Daddy as a lesson

[Chorus]
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
(It's a shame, it's a shame alright)
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame

[Mac Daddy]
It's a shame the way this thing goes down
How one lay you down just to show he don't play around
He goes to sleep with a head full of anger
and wakes up a full-energized gangbanger
Talkin about a-tisket, a-tasket
Not knowin the next day he'll be layin in the casket
So what you think of that, son?
In the arcade they play in, the games ain't fun 
(Yeah) Somethin like Pac-Man
Same name, but the game is you put it in the sack and
run up to the next board
And gat down a fool standin in the way of the door
There's no board or no points
And in this game, this all Pac-Man wants
The gang, the ghost that always bloomin
and you slip up and they'll smoke ya

[Chorus]

[Mac Daddy]
None of this'll cease with the word peace (peace brother)
You gotta do more than two fingers, maaaan please
Get a game that they gotta go by
Instead of "Watch out quick, I send 'em to the sky"
That ain't nothin to be playin with
So listen what I give, and what I be sayin, kid
Take it from a kid's point of view
Cause on my way to school, I be watchin you (word)

[Daddy Mac]
Big big Daddy in the Caddy with all his boys
Always tag weeks, it's a joy
That's the first part, second part is havin heart
And when you get caught, knowin how to restart
You gotta know how to watch ya back
Cause if you slack, huh~! You're goin in a sack
I advise ya y'all to watch for the game
..cause the game ain't nothin but a..

[Chorus]</pre>
