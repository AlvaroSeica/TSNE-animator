[Ice-T]
This is not supposed to be positive
This music is negative, because the streets are negative
You know; so.. in the records
You're gonna hear violence, you're gonna hear aggressive behavior
by individuals that lived that lifestyle out
You know; that's why I tell them, it's not like Steven King
Who makes a horror movie with a happy ending
They don't have happy endings, it's a horror movie
It's supposed to end horrible, you see!
And this is what I do, so.. people that are gonna.. that did like me
Are gonna be.. really shocked when they hear my new record
Cause it's going to scare the shit out of people</pre>
