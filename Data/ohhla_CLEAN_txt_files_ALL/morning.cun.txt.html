[Intro]
Here I'm standing naked
Your search for answers will end in agony
Here I'm standing naked ("Me too..")
One thing's for certain that is my destiny

[Psalm One]
I give you everything, yo...
Standing in front of you naked crying again and I feel like a tyrant 
I told you once that I loved you more than music - I was lying! 
But I swear you're the closest second, and I am the most depressive 
But you really make me better, and I really tried to let ya 
This angry love a lecture, vulnerability measures
You calm me with your presence, when you leave me I get reckless 
So I'm retchin, and hopefully I throw up all these Catch 22's 
How could you win when I'm losing me, fool? 
Sucks to be truth that we through but we not 
Catch us in bed it's so oooh~! We three hot 
Maximum pressure for you to see right through my heart 
You so smart, you can pick me apart 
Playing the cards I was dealt as an only child with a single mom 
I got, abandonment issues for days and if you make me mad I'm gone 
So I'm wrong, now come and make me right while my eyes are dancing 
You see just how I'm standing, plus I'm a Cancer 

[Chorus]
Here I'm standing naked
Your search for answers will end in agony
Here I'm standing naked 
One thing's for certain that is my destiny

[Natti]
Naked as in assed-out, dusted without a cent 
Sex was twerkin for us and love spray was the scent 
Made it rain while we singles, so emotionally spent 
While building our house of love, she came up short on the rent 
Fell head over heels/hills but couldn't feel the decent 
The quicker the lights flicker, the quicker the liquor hits 
I was feral, out to get lucky, her ass was heaven above me 
And I was dying to go there as soon the spirits touched me 
Club lights can turn Misses Fugly to Misses Fucks Me 
Cus I ain't talkin slick trick, don't confuse it with rusty 
We left our love in that condom under your sister's truck seat 
My bucket wasn't fly enough for you after our first meet 
No need to be thirsty, no need to rehearse the 
One night standing between you and your next me 
Send me a nice picture, you still thick as a swap meet 
But stop callin, breathing hard and whispering to me softly.. 

[Chorus]

[Blu]
Yo, you prob'ly thinking that you know me, huh? 
Know me so well that you can't show me none 
Well I showed you once, I know that, I told you only once 
and what you do? Take the full nine yards and scored a touch 
But your hand went right through me, you thought you knew me, huh? 
Thought that you could see me when you woke up but you woke up 
and you know what? You prol'ly realize that you ain't know much 
The Cold Crush, the "so-what-you-told-your-homies-for-four-months" like 
"We was so drunk," even though you learn to roll blunts 
Now how you think I feel about that? You used to feel my tracks 
Feel my raps, tell me who you finna' know as real as that 
It's true, you could see right through me but see me truly 
Don;t think that you could screw me and tell your homegirls you used me 
Like you didn't know this nigga know such-and-such and know so-and-so 
But honestly? I know how you really feel when you close the do'
and I'm right there, Mr. Invisible in your right ear 
It's funny how one night can make you feel like it's a year 
but yeah, fo' real...</pre>
