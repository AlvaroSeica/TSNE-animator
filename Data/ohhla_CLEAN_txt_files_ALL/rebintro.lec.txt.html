[Intro/Chorus]
Rebel
I'm in rebellion {*4X*}

[Lecrae]
Jesus was a rebel, a renegade, outlaw
A sanctified troublemaker but he never sinned, naw
and he lived his life by a different set of Rules
the culture ain't approve
so you know they had they had to bruise em
that's the way they do
man, they swear they so gangsta but everyones the same
everybody do the same stuff
tattoo, piercing
smokin' up and drinking
money and sex plus them extravagant weekends
if that's the high life
I'll puff puff pass that
you leave evaporated like you missing a gas cap
I guess I'm passed that
cause I am in rebellion
I'd rather have a dollar in my pocket than a mill-ion
I'm scared to worship money, and my wants over Elyon
I'll remain a rebel while the rest of them just carry on
this is what I live fo
this the hill I'm buried on
if Jesus is the truth
that means one of us is VERY wrong
think about it

[Chorus]

[Interlude over Chorus]
I know that in our day rebel means sinner
but everyone is sinning so it is no longer rebellious to sin
Jesus was a rebel who was counter cultural

[Lecrae]
No glory in me; all glory to the King on the throne
you either love him or leave him alone but you can't do both
yeah, you probably heard that once in song
I pray you hear 10 mo fo ya gone
yeah listen up, holmes
The stage is my corner and my crowd is the streets
That's why I rap the bread of life cause they dyin' to eat
I'm a rebel you know the kind that die in the street
Cause you refuse to conform, won't eat the king's meat
look, if Christ rebelled by shunning the cultured
He eatin with the sinners givin Pharasies ulcers
He never got married, was broke and plus homeless
Anmd yeah that's the God I roll wit
Your boy got a wife, and no I never cheated
I'm prayin for humility whenever I get heated
Forget about the drugs, rebel against pornography
This ain't how it oughta be, homey this is how it's gotta be
A rebel

[Outro]
You are just a conformist, if you are drunk and naked
driving around on a lot of motorcycles
smoking cigarettes and breaking commandments
and getting pregnant out of wedlock
Everyone has do that it is so tired
If you really want to be a rebel, read your bible
because no one is doing that
That is rebellion
That's the only rebellion left</pre>
