[ J. Sands whispering ]
Yo
(What?)
The Paper Chase
(What?)
Yo
Watch your back, man
Because you never ever know where they're at
Paper Chase
Watch your back
Because you never ever know where they're at

[ VERSE 1: J. Sands ]
For me it's kind of easy when I say these words
You deserve what you get and you get what you deserve
At any point in time any thing can occurr
Cause you never know what he said or she said to her
Cause it's all behind your back before you even know the facts
Reading you like the constellations of the zodiacs
Man, your people do, but when you come through
They don't be claimin you say they gamin you
Cause the revenue grew
Free treats, free pay-per-view should be a clue
That the party's over here, throw your hands in the air
See, that's when they try to get you
Schemin so they can hit you
Ski mask in the shadows, creepin to catch you sleepin
That out of town stay for the weekend, cats peepin
Jealous eyes conspire for your demise
Realize that once a man is given a chance, he tries

[ CHORUS: J. Sands ]
Words from the wise, yo, you analyze that
Then you'll see all them cats aimin knives at your back
Smilin in your face once you step up in the place
Everybody's lined up to race for the paper chase
The snakes, the fakes, they do whatever it takes

[ VERSE 2: J. Sands ]
Aiyo, 'how many of us have them?' How many?
When things get real, kid, you're lucky to have any
Cause everybody's strugglin to find that extra penny
Only a few succeed, so the rest be like 'gimme!'
That's why I only roam with my son
You take the l out of 'Lone', you'll be left with 'one'
Catalyst, the sole controller and the strategist in fact
So if you're schemin on my mullah, don't let the kindness fool ya
Cause it can be peace but even a peace must cease
Like when I saw my man grabbin bills out my fleece
Now I'm lookin at my man with my wallet in his hand
Yo, I couldn't understand cause we supposed to be fam
Now what do I do? Slice him like a honey baked ham?
Or stay calm under pressure, be greater than the lesser
When lookin at this cat when his paw's on my treasure?
Shoulda known better, everybody racin for cheddar
That's why I'm tellin you, you can never say never

[ CHORUS ]
Words from the wise, yo, you analyze that
Then you'll see all them cats aimin knives at your back
Smilin in your face once you step up in the place
Everybody's lined up to race for the paper chase
The snakes, the fakes, they do whatever it takes
Aiyo, that's wack when them cats be aimin knives at your back
Smilin in your face once you step up in the place
Everybody's lined up to race for the paper chase
The snakes, the fakes, they do whatever it takes

[ VERSE 3: J. Sands ]
Aiyo, they run up in your place, fatigues and masked face
While you're at the table with your family saying your grace
In this paper chase this shit can get as high as the stakes
Tied up on the living room floor with ductape
Can't trust snakes, they slither and slide
???? open wide with all eyes on the prize
Scopin just hopin one day they can get you for your tokens
Even chickens be flippin, mixin Mickey's in your potion
Start provokin like when you come home your safe is broken
Lockpit, like who you brought home, a locksmith
Black glove, no fingerprints ????
Professional with the nail file
Got your jewels, this shit is too wild
While you're sittin in court waitin ???? blue trial
Out of state with all your cake, what can you do?
Better keep a sharper eye on niggas close to you

[ CHORUS ]
And that's word from the wise, yo, you analyze that
Then you see all them cats aimin knives at your back
Smilin in your face once you step up in the place
Everybody's lined up to race for the paper chase
The snakes, the fakes, they do whatever it takes
Aiyo, that's wack when them cats be aimin knives at your back
When you step up in the placece
Everybody's lined up to race for the paper chase
So watch your back, cousin</pre>
