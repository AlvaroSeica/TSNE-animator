[Verse One: Scarface]
I used to think I had a winner, but now I wouldn't treat yo' ass for dinner
In a fast food if you were starvin, I wouldn't lend ya
A silver nickel that would help you with yo' problems
I love my children I just hate my baby mamas
These bitches figurin they kids 'gon be the meal ticket
You need to get a job hoe before you get evicted
Professional, child support recipients 
Havin baby after baby for the dividends
I never loved her she was just somethin to fuck
That I fucked too much had busted luck cost that last nut
May we never be a couple, it's all bad
And I don't wanna see my kid because of yo' dog ass
I was sittin in a jail cell for a whole year
In and out of courtrooms behind this hoe here
Relationship with my who bitch?! You ruined that
Never will I forgive your scandalous ass for doin that
Thirsty hoe is gettin old so they panickin
The kids is gettin grown and now they understandin it
You know I payed the hoe direct, but she sayin that I didn't
Payback is a motherfucker bitches!!!
'Cause how you did me 'gon come back to haunt you (Come back to haunt you!)
Get off yo' fat bumpy ass you fuckin stalk you!
Sorry hoes always lookinfor a hand out
Half dressed at family functions so she stands out

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
I'm writin a letter to my baby, I'm writin a letter to my son
Tell him things done got too crazy
But it's not over it's not done
I told ya mama I don't lover her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'm a be the bad one, I'm a be the bad one
I just wanna see my son

[Verse Two: Don Trip]
I'd tried talkin to the bitch
But she keeps using you as a barganin chip
And I am not the one to be barganin with!
That just made me wanna go and put my paws on that bitch!
I swear this shit ain't even right bruh
I ain't even got the chance to change the fuckin diaper
This is what I get for goin raw when I piped her
Thinkin that I loved her when I shouldn't even liked her
But I do not regret my child
Stupid bitch I just wanna see my child!
Do what you may but you won't never make me bow!
Fuck child support bitch take me to trial!
Why you with this shit 'cause I ain't reach no vows
Bitch move on me and you ain't workin out!
So what it matter if I moved or workout?!
As long as I provide and put food in his mouth

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
I'm writin a letter to my baby, I'm writin a letter to my son
Tell him things done got too crazy
But it's not over it's not done
I told ya mama I don't lover her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'm a be the bad one, I'm a be the bad one
I just wanna see my son

[Verse Three: Don Trip]
Matter of fact I'm in school right now
Incase the music don't work and I could put the work down
My mama say this shit sure to workout
All this bullshit I'm goin through to see my first child
See his first steps, see his first smile
Hear his first words, teach him how to count
But I guess I've been counted out
Seein as the bitch don't want me around
When I speak to him he don't recognize the sound
The sound of my voice so he just looks around
I know she enjoy it so I suck it up and smile
But fuck this stupid bitch I just wanna see my child

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
I'm writin a letter to my baby, I'm writin a letter to my son
Tell him things done got too crazy
But it's not over it's not done
I told ya mama I don't lover her
It made her trip and now she gone
So I'm a be the bad one, I'm a be the bad one
I just wanna see my son</pre>
