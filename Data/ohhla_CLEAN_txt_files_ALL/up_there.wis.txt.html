[Intro: Phillie]
Uh... you don't know
Yeah... you don't know...
That's why we searching
And we are... uh...

[Phillie]
Time to move on, the mind's coveted by the dome
To hide my thoughts, til spitting on microphone
Get in MC's, rip parts, degree, who's next?
My battle arena, at the Fox Coliseum
Not on stage, but the streets, lyrical thief
And petty the theft, it's about to increase
Alert my peeps, meet at the Penobscot
Acobo, get loco, uh-oh, they cops
Not really from inside, guess we sorta in the middle
Sold us numbers til I die, but I plan to live a little
I don't bake pies, I put, mind on the grittle
You can walk in my shoes, but probably can't fit 'em
Hip hop was life, Pac was the logo
They say Big was number one, that's the way it go though
Got an ill crew, most I roll solo
One call, we show stopper, you Davy Jones' Locker
Gotta, feed my seeds, see we earn our keep
Said that sleep is the cousin of death, not a wink
Don't blink twice, only tryin' to guard my life
Don't think twice, like, fuck stars and stripes
Seeing shit that'll have an average Joe scarred for life
Yet through my darkest nights, I'm sharp as a knife
Fight with all my might, the sun don't shine
One way or the other, hear the other side
All that's left is pride, the fire that is I
Phillie's his own lettuce, next week it's fries
Out to get mine, any way I can get it
High, I'm seeing double like a New York Minute
Ride, I'm seeing trouble can't get caught in it
Focused, to identify the sharks in the business

[Chorus: Phillie]
I pass, they run, they cross, yours and mine
Until then, follow the signs
The world ain't perfect, neither am I
But strive to overcome, only way to survive
Mama gave me life, raised me right
Gave me sight, saved my life
And all my experiences made me right
Wonder what's having a baby like

[Bronze Nazareth]
What's having a baby like, December 8th, was the date the skies was pale
The streets felt tense, like the same word in brail
A close encounter, we begin days back
I'm on Tony Dorset's street for a great haze sack
Old man, his teeth crooked like the streets of Detroit
Took my cash, and came back with pebbles of crack
And as I cut my eyes, back to the other side
The sound of a siren cut open the skies
Purple rain I'm arranged in chains, my girl since seven months
Me? I'm seven years and some change
Something strange in the court room, veins is my fortune
I'm from a place where the avenues are scorching
Boulevard bullet scars, the road is a warpath
You better do your street war math
And he buckled in handcuffs, I snuffed his man, what? Cameras convicted me
My girl ain't paid rent, she evicted three months later
Shelter to shelter, wires like raining

[Chorus]

[Kevlaar 7]
Let me show what I see, go inside, climb a pyramid's incline
I see the promised land planned in Martin Luther's mind
Chime bells, my seeds is healthy, felt self medication
Infect me, envy is evil, genetic trap marks from the needle
Confined in a young mind, grind teeth, every man is feeble
My fetus sees through the future, grasping memories
Through a mirrors out reaching, unbelievable
I'm still living, one decade is a given
Two is a blessing, eight more is god testing
I don't know what's up there til I climb the stairs
Or grow a pair of wings, every one stares at a martyr
Parts of life, my light skin make it harder
Part of me is being already, fire starter

[Salute]
It's a small town, but a big rep to hold up
Fuck a book, I wanna be a G when I grow up
Screws is lose, hustle leave it harder for juice
Got the future like the past, cuz they poison the youth
Marijuana selling, on the streets like cookies
Franchise teams, being lead by rookies
Hear it in the sky, it's him overlooking
So we stuck in the game, like at birth with a name
With a picture full of crack, in a positive frame
Partners with terror, living in a gooned out era
Seeing death, more common than the face in the mirror
Tears of shame, murder raps, caught for change
Rest in peace, to Stone Red, for the born'll get slain...

[Chorus]</pre>
