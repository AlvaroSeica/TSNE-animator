Oooh ooooh

[LB]
You say you love me so bad but you won't let me be myself
You say you love me so bad but I can't act like no one else
You say you love me so bad baby that's not how I do
You say you love me so bad why can't we play the hand we're dealt

[Joyo Verlade]
Love me, love me, love me, love me like you want to be loved
Or you're gonna lose, me lose me, lose me baby cos I can't be what you want
{*repeat 2X*}

[LB]
You say lately I've been acting strangely and irrationally
And after all the things I've said, you're confused and rightfully
I said I wanna take you there when she tries I just retreat
And says that I won't open up and when I do she's pulling teeth
I admit that I have some baggage I aint ready to release
Commitment in relationships comes with difficulty
She says I sabotage myself I said I don't disagree
She says until you leave the past behind we'll never be happy

Love me, love me, love me, love me like you want to be loved
Or you're gonna lose, me lose me, lose me baby cos I can't be what you want
{*repeat 2X*}

[Joyo Verlade]
Spend to much time thinking 'bout the things that you don't have
Are you so blind that you can't see whats in your hands
Love is never more than just a breath away
Baby say my name I'll be there instantly
We could be so close but still you hesitate
Can't release the memory of yesterday

Love me, love me, love me, love me like you want to be loved
Or you're gonna lose, me lose me, lose me baby cos I can't be what you want
{*repeat 2X*}

[LB]
You say you love me so bad but you won't let me be myself
You say you love me so bad but I can't act like no one else
You say you love me so bad baby that's not how I do
You say you love me so bad why can't we play the hand we're dealt {*3X*}

[Joyo Verlade]
The things I do I don't do just to please you
That's not the reason that I do the things I do {*4X*}
