Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: King Just]
We, don't like you...
Hate on us, we hate on you
This is true, cuz

[King Just]
Yeah, we does, and I ain't got nothing to front for
Pound a brown, bout to fucking lay down the law
Niggas is scared when KJ touch the microphone
When they get on, they don't wanna give a dog a bone
They see me with a wife and a home, living good
They wanna drive-by, still see me stuck in the hood
How you gonna represent the Stat', when albums is wack
Niggas is lucky that Ghost brought it back...
Hi-jack the beat track, and then I throw 'em to the shred
Cuz a picky nigga like me'll get you off your ass
I ain't starving, cuz I already had a taste
And I survived, cuz my team still move weight
Concentrate on your hate, but you can still relate
Cuz you was once there saying "damn, how long will it take
For me to shine, so I can show the world I can rhyme"
I was looking for the dotted line, so I can sign
And run with the best crew, show 'em what I can do
Now it's like 'fuck me, no, fuck you'

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
Stay smashing, any MC who think he massive
Who think he high post cuz he high fashion
I ain't asking, man, I do what I got to
To take KJ out, it'll take a whole lotta
MC, just stuck with my path, the flow I wrath
We can meet on Soble Court on Park Hill Ave.
And crash like the ram, on a Mountain Dew commercial
You need to start walking like Hershell
My studio is universal, after that it's galactic
Horror tactics, don't get it backwards
K put the C in the Carter, and serious like your fucking father
Nigga, don't bother, the archer
Bow and arrow sparrow, threw Nat like Carol
I told you telling ass niggas to tattle
They don't wanna battle, they seen what I did to they idol
Standing in the corner all spiteful

[Chorus 2X]

[King Just]
Stop the presses, ain't no second guesses
Acting like you don't know who the best is
You better start confessing, or learn your lesson
KJ, I'm kind of hard to find in this profession
Did I mention, I battle from the Harbor to the Hill
With a license to kill, every rapper that ain't real
I reveal the un-secret, un-beat shit
With a hooptie rider deep dish with a mean bitch
Leave it alone, if you can't phone home
Rambo, I'm bout to go Sly Stallone
Arnold Schwarzeneg', with plans to be big
And sell more records than Jig, "can I live?"
Shit, I ain't try'nna look like the frost
Stuck in the projects, looking lost
I'm try'nna be the boss, and have a company that I own
I don't eat pork, but I wanna bring the bacon home

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
