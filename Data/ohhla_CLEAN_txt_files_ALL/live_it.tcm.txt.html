[Chorus]
Life is hard enough wit people dyin round here everyday
You dont want to die, but you know you gonna do it any way
But there's another life after this one that's given if you wanna
Live it, live it, live it, live it, live it, live it, live it, live it

Struggle will make a man do what he wouldnt do naturally
But there's a natural struggle inside that'll bring catastrophe
But there's a cure, but only for those that are wit it, you better come
Get it. get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it

[Tonic]
If you're livin choose life, if you're driven choose right
Yo, you'll never find light, if you're walkin by sight, feel me?
It's a faith walk, cut the small talk
Even Superman gotta take his cape off
When he's touched by the immaculate Emmanuel
Who looks to put you back in style like Gel
But you dont want style
You wanna live the never-ending life of a super Ghetto Star Child
But dont we all wanna fluant it?
Dont it feel good to have people up on it
But it aint all false, it aint all fruad
Aint the way that leads down to destruction real broad
Or was it just hype, is truth optional
Is God just another all day pop-cycle
A sucker wit alot of profound speech
Without enough skill to make it mean something in the streets
Can the baller just take it or leave it
Can the huney, say "YO, Im tellin you he dont mean it"
Wll that's life dillemma, everybody gotta admit it
But when you choose you're locked in it to live it

[Bridge]
What you do in this life is gonna matter
So take time get it right baby

[Chorus]

[Tonic]
I pray I got the right rhyme
To stop any more posion comin through your pipeline
Something to restore you to your right mind
Im tryin to put Jesus on the mainline
You circled the Ave like a vulture
Studied the science of street horticulture
Got a green thumb, when it comes to makin
Fillable, smokable, cirgar paper mache-type sculptures
In the bing you know how to hand the C.O.
When you get out, how to run game on your P.O.
When the blocks hot, how to call a T.O.
But you need to a know a story, similar to Morpheus and Neo
But aint no time to play tricks in the Matrix
Real life cost more then your matinee flicks
Neo died, came back wit all power in their message
But its a movie, and you dont have to accept it
But when the Truth comes back on the day of the blessed
Every knee gon bow and every tongue confess it
And when we bounce you can only take what you came wit
In heaven all that bling round your neck is just pavement
Streets of gold dont let dubs roll on em
Why would I need a Bentley, when Ima fly Whoadie
Besides, this aint Dolomite meets the Devine
What you thought, it was Superfly meets the Sublime
And nah, heaven aint got no ghetto, no stiletto
If Im lyin call me the son of Jepetto
Bit if Im sayin what the truth says and you get it
God is lockin men down to eternally live it

[Bridge]
