[Werd]
Check like chess the king of the castle
Who switch in the game like a king and a castle
Beef like cattle a fights less hassle
And you take an L like a knight if we battle
One two check 
Check one two
Check-mate mate who the fuck are you
Check on the boards they love to argue
They check every cunt but they dont check you
Hey thats true
Sit back look
Dont like rap get hit with the hook
King of the castle
King of the rook
Move straight in the game
All you pawns get shook
Yeah my jaw pop with ease
Look at all angles top degrees
Werds on the board like top left keys
Just no stopping till I get my piece

[Female Voice] [X2]
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm freeing my trapped soul
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm making examples of you

Lets go
Its like what I got to do to make and write music
Rap fans have to catch a vibe to this
Dance seems fucked and bounce all night through this
Long as I'm alive provide all types to this
What you got planned could spark a joint to this
Young girls dance the radio might use this
Try and play it cool relax get high to this
Raps a type proving thats how a do this

[Female Voice]
Must be the reason why I'm king of
Must be the reason why I'm king of

Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm freeing my trapped soul
Must be the reason why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reason why I'm making examples of you</pre>
