[Intro]
That's that shit [flipmode]
That's that shit [flipmode][c'mon c'mon]
Yeah,that's that shit,son [flipmode][c'mon c'mon]
Turn that shit up,yo,that's that shit son?

[Chorus]
Yo where my niggas is at son -Say what Say what
When they deep four jeeps kid -Say what Say what
And you be hittin' that too son -Say what Say what
Yo,do we run this motherfucker -Uh-huh,uh-huh
 
[Verse 1]
Eeinee-meenee-meinie-moe See me 
spit supreme grimy flows
World famous,burn haters,eyes be closed
Terrorize friendly skies,try me homes.
My slang blow somewhere over the rainbow
ugly like Dodge Durango's packed with plain-clothes
I gotta do what i gotta do
Drop a jewel
heavy-handed like poppa-duke,run from an orange juice
"Who that is?" Land lord,son son
"Do that shit." Keep you fam on the run run
Fuck a badge and a gun,entered the dragon and won
Swing my hammer at one,know that you vagilant huh
I damage you,huh
Slow your speed up
Camouflage,turn cameras off,foes get sweeped up
Believe that,off the meat rack,pick the beef up
Dumbin' out,cover your mouth when we creep up

[Chorus]
Gotta stack it off the books now -Say what Say what
It's off the chain,off the hook now -Say what Say what
Stick and move like them crooks,blow! - Say what Say what
A'yo is Brooklyn in the house?-Uh-huh,uh-huh.
Playin' for keeps,no tommorrow fam-Say what Say what
Life aint sweet you get body slammed -Say what Say what
We major leagues when you minor,man -Say what Say what
Shit,shut 'em down,shut 'em down -Uh-huh,uh huh
 
[Verse 2]
"Bravo!Bravo!" 
96 Tahoe,seven man cargo of John Doe's
Macho,grab crotch like Donny Brosco
Vato,stay rugged like a pot-hole
Attitude?!?Back-slap a crew
natural,and stack capitol,casual
Rap-a-bomb MC.
Stay in the cut like Trapper John M.D
Spit up a capsule,a half a pharmacy
Kill a jam
With Land lord milligrams 
calm your team
Actin' brand new like them big-face twenties
What it look like
when them kids aint ready for the black-out
Twelve-monkey status
Spaz-out,bring chunky classics.
Then break 'em down like Rav-4's,flash the hazards
Dirty like Sanford &amp; Son,there you have it
 
[Chorus]
Yo where my niggas is at son -Say what Say what
When they deep four jeeps kid -Say what Say what
And you be hittin' that too son -Say what Say what
Yo,do we run this motherfucker -Uh-huh,uh-huh
Gotta stack it off the books now -Say what Say what
It's off the chain,off the hook now -Say what Say what
Stick and move like them crooks,blow! - Say what Say what
A'yo is Brooklyn in the house -Uh-huh,uh-huh.
Playin' for keeps,no tommorrow fam -Say what Say what
Life aint sweet you get body slammed -Say what Say what
We major leagues when you minor,man -Say what Say what
Shit,shut 'em down,shut 'em down -Uh-huh,uh huh

Say what Say what
Say what Say what
Say what Say what
Uh-huh,uh huh
Say what Say what
Say what Say what
Say what Say what
Uh-huh,uh huh</pre>
