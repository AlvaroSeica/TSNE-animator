[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
One day you're here
And then you're gonnnnne
One day you're here, baby
And then you're gonnnnne
Been labeled a menace and put in the Guinness
You better go check my manuscript - hey, hey, hey, hey
Been labeled a menace and put in the Guinness
You better go check that manuscript - hey, hey, hey, hey

[Layzie Bone]
It's been about twelve years since I seen my nigga
When we buried him in the ground, damn Wally I miss you
We wrote that song about you dawg, it was Bone's biggest hit
We went and broke them Beatles records, you can say you the shit
I seen yo' momma last week, and we laughed and cried
Reminiscin how you lived, then you suddenly died
But she strong, and we strong, you livin through Bone
So much drama goin on, I had to write you this song
Them tears droppin on my paper, for my nigga in heaven
I know you in a better place, to be yo' friend was a blessin
Every day's a different lesson, so I take it with stride
Still the mission is the money, so I make it and ride
You feel the drums, and the strings, and the lyrics that we bring
Two bad niggaz untouchable team, fuck you pay me, that's the thing
Bad to the motherfuckin Bone dawg, step up in the Bone yard
In the paint we go hard, {*edit*} for life, my road dawg

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
I got an envelope of paper in my pocket, we grindin
Turnin 50's into 100's, baby that's perfect timin
While shinin in the black Ac', windows tinted
Four women in the car with me, is this pimpin?
Baby evil always lurk in the dark, ooh park
We bustin down the +Chambers+ in the Wu-Tang art
Now chitty bang-bang, take a trip down memo' lane
Picture me runnin, picture me comin, we all 100
Feel the fuckin drummer drummin, we live and direct
And come connect, with the posses of soldiers and resurrect
Selective of my word use, know of truce
Obstruction of the justice that we did in our youth
See it's a new day, new way, see me in the afterlife
Holla at me, love me don't condemn me, that's the price
It's a new day, new way, see me in the afterlife
Holla at me, love me or condemn me, that's the price

[Chorus] Â– 2X</pre>
