Album:  1st Amendment
Song:   Keep it Tight
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Ellie]
We keep it tight, from the streets to the stage light
It's alright, just party all through the night
We gettin' right, so just do what you feel like
It's alright, just party all through the night

[Lounge Lo]
Now you see me in the club, rubbing a dub
Smoking a bud, chicks ain't showing no love
But, we gon' bounce and love to this
Late night, cake fight, gon' fight to this
What's the luck with this, are you and your girl on some stuck-up shit
Me and my wiz on some hugs and kisses, I love my bitch
Every now and then, a little bit of talk around, what
Lounge Lo, can't walk around, shit? Othorized can't hold it down
I'm in the middle where it's all, all that, BBC is where I ball that
You wanna come with the bouncy bounce, got ice and half an ounce
Pimped in the club, snub in the club
Girl on the rug, pump that pussy, if you givin' it up
Scotch with the Amaretto, let me see you shake it up
(Ellie: Henny with the Alize, Thug Passion, shake it up)
Back it up, club mode, tuck that heat by the waist, let the wide face
Shine on the street light, stage light
Party all night, you getting it right

[Chorus 2X]

[Ellie]
Ya'll hater cats, style's is loud, I can fuck with that
Club in the back, where the party at?
When you hit it from the back, yo, I'm loving that
Cuz bitches be thugging that
Keep it tight, get it right, cuz it's on tonight
With the O.T.F.A.M., got these hands
We keep it tight, from the streets to the stage light

[Molly-Q]
Keep it tight, right, big game, like, every night
Blaze clubs, where's the hood scum?
Hydro, Lounge with the Lo, Cruncha Beneen, Wigs Ice Talk
Spots is hot, rock the block, call the cops, but we never gon' stop
Rock it off, shock it off, for the birds in here with thong-thong-thong
Bottle party, street model, that's a motto, you follow?
Coast to coast, slum from boat, feel my bitch, then roll the most
Where my loves that bust the toast, O.T.F., all night, and we gettin' right

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
