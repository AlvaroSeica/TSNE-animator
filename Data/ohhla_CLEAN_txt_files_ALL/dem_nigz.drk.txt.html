Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Never put a bitch before dem niggas
Niggas in my blood, never snitch on dem niggas
I never btm on niggas, never taking leave you in that bitch all in the building
No, I take a case for dem niggas, run up on the niggas, take a face for them niggas
No, roll that l's 3 times for them niggas, life love loyalty, I be there for my niggas

Wake up around 100 niggas, lord know this shit is real
Never gave me my niggas name, that's why they sentenced me a year
Loyal but I'm self made, for them wait I gotta deal, no medication in my eyes
I told you that it's been a drill
2012 white hummer, same year, my summer, 300 that's the game
L's up but we don't draw numbers
Beans on that Glock 10, now you're facing head trauma
48 grammy even death know I ain't [?]
Both away, don't bark yourself, swear my car it parks itself
I'm selling white, no Michael phelps, know that money marks the death
But I still take my chances for my son and otl
Deep inside my bro ain't tell them anything I know them, that's respect

Never put a bitch before dem niggas
Niggas in my blood, never snitch on dem niggas
I never btm on niggas, never taking leave you in that bitch all in the building
No, I take a case for dem niggas, run up on the niggas, take a face for them niggas
No, roll that l's 3 times for them niggas, life love loyalty, I be there for my niggas

Even though I've called my case and jack boys tyina catch my face
Police tryina add a case, don't want me see another day
They [?] off these niggas, that wanna see a nigga break
Pride is all I got, now I'm working on my inner faith
Gave my niggas 15, it's easy doing 13 straight
But it's hard deep inside, know it's baby 28
But I'mma hold them down, long as loyalty be on my face
I'mma stick around, long as these clown niggas don't get my face
L's, them fake ass niggas, them snake ass niggas [?] duck tape ass niggas
No rat ass niggas, keep tec ass niggas
You can't get right, I leave them left ass niggas, let's get it!

Never put a bitch before dem niggas
Niggas in my blood, never snitch on dem niggas
I never btm on niggas, never taking leave you in that bitch all in the building
No, I take a case for dem niggas, run up on the niggas, take a face for them niggas
No, roll that l's 3 times for them niggas, life love loyalty, I be there for my niggas</pre>
