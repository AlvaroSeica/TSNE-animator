[Intro: Popa Chief]
Mmm-hmm... yeah
My brand new ODB Wear
With my crispy new wallies, uh-huh, come on

[Chorus: Popa Chief]
Play that right there, real thugs don't fight fair
Look at my right there, not her, right there
With the long hair, watermelon derriere
Yeah, I'm talking to you right there

[Popa Chief]
Popular, some be the dub, cold out the eye-rub
Wrestle us from grub, less from dirt in the tub
Since smoked six, with my nigs, meet me at the club
The brother in the mirror is all he said he was
Super nigga dub looking right, merge a pack of Vegas
And some sticky big bud
Hit the local pub, get some wheat and barley a hug
Make my rounds and show all my birds love
Peaching and creaming, first class with an economy swerve
Shaking, not stirring, parking lot, pimp alot, mack daddy limp-a-lot
Chase chickens like Roy Jones to stay in shape, why not?
The disco ball swirl, dusty records spins
Two Heiny's and a Henn', ma, I'm a virgin
Oooh, what's the chance of me and your merging?
How's about some breakfast in bread, I'm splurging

[Chorus 2X]

[Popa Chief]
Stealths, beats be bouncing, titties be bouncing
Thugs be bouncing, LQ's flowing like water out the fountain
Dicks is hard enough to move mountains
So many fly chicks I've been stop counting
Fix is tight, game is tight, I'm leaving with something
I ain't got my mojo working for nothing
Cops'll tell you pull your thong over your shoulder
Like suspenders, I got a freaky agenda
If I'm not your fender bender, Aries the grammar
I'm a San Diego rooting for the Chargers
(Buddha Monk: Aiyo, hold up, ain't you that South Jersey, nigga?)
Chill, kick back, only for the winner
In the mean time, in between time, all the
Hot honeys and all the bomb crimes I could find
From 6-0-9, 7-1-8 to 6-0-9
All at once, or one at a time

[Chorus 2X]

[Popa Chief]
Pop something, roll something, ma let me hold something
Get at your boy, later on you wanna do something
Belly up to the bar, I want a tall something
Knock the dust off my coat, now get the party jumping
Bounce with me like bed springs at an orgy
Bounce with me like memories at a party
Bounce with me like a 6-4 with 'lics
Somebody's puffin' blueberry, pass that shit!

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
