[June Marx]
Close your eyes and imagine this, cabinets 
Full of amulets lavish fabrics, elaborate chalices
Manuscripts, ancestor passages, channel it 
Inside candle lit palaces then I master it
Queens honor me,
Meditate at the hall of supreme harmony
Regime armory,every square hardened 
Prepare the fallen for burial marching
Marxman, stereo arson, tear thru a squadron
Spliff from the imperial garden
We sovereign, reign from the glorious gate
And conquering, pain thats a warriors fate
Euphoric estate, potion from the holiest towns
Words spoken, open ceremonial grounds
Its an omen, sign of your dynasty's demise
True emperors have finally arrived

[Lone Ninja]
Raid in the twilight, break
In the gate with divine might 
Sacred mysteries, ancient in hindsight		
Face the enemy shapeless, the knives slice
Great agility, bravest defy fright	
Climb heights that no one ever dared to
Shine bright slash shogun, slay the fearful		
Spear flew long distance and pierce shield
We're too strong, incensed with fierce skills			
Bitter thoughts Ninja stalk in the inner court
Been distraught the hellish anger is raging		
Special practice and training in the central 
Axis of beijing the peril faction is reigning		
Act lawless, and heinous, I hoard the power
Attack fortress and aim at the corner tower		
In temple the floors paved, with golden bricks
Twin Perils the lords, they will pose a risk	</pre>
