[Intro]
Hello Albert
Why, hello Jesse
How's life going?
Oh, splendid. And for you?
Well I'm all fine and dandy myself
Great.
Cool!

[Chorus]
Eyes filled with pride
Heart full of truth
Smile real wide
And my art is the proof
That my childish side
Is far from removed
Hey yo, I got that
Got that
Got that
Got that
Juice

[Verse 1: Jesse Abraham]
I got whatcha want
Whatcha need
Need proof?
Don't want a croissant or a bean, Jesus
It's not a ruse
Offer me some OJ, I won't refuse
It's how I stay loose
So let's say truce
It ain't the booze it's the juice I abuse
Yeah
Don't ever try to carbonate
I'm a Jew so you know my juice can't be from concentrate

[Chorus]
Eyes filled with pride
Heart full of truth
Smile real wide
And my art is the proof
That my childish side
Is far from removed
I got that
I got that
Got that
I got that juice
I got that juice
I got that juice
I got that juice
Hey yo, I got that juice
I got that juice
I got that
Got that
Got that
Got that
Got that
Juice

[Verse 2: Albert Rhymestein]
I'm considered a connoisseur
When I walk through the door it means juice will be poured
I take a big swig
Swirl it round my tongue and soft palette
Then allow it or declare it poor
I adore produce to be sure
When unpeeled and liquefied I enjoy it that much more
Precious and infectious I'm a fiend for the nectar
The juice bar's my nexus but next up's the food store
Check this
Got more juice than virgin daiquiris
More juice in me than a freshly charged battery
More juice in me than the V-8 factory
Full of antioxidants, opposite of dastardly
Blueberries, strawberries, blackberries
I enjoy them all as if they're the very last berry
Rarely as in never do I terry
I even shred Webster in the blender then I ingest vocabulary

[Chorus]
Eyes filled with pride
Heart full of truth
Smile real wide
And my art is the proof
That my childish side
Is far from removed
I got that
I got that
got that
I got that juice
I got that juice
I got that juice
I got that juice
Hey yo, I got that juice
I got that juice
I got that
Got that
Got that
Got that
Got that

[Bridge]
You could be 2Pac standin on a roof
You ain't got my juice
You could be Jamba holding onto fruits
You ain't got my juice
You could be a banana
The place where you live it could be a cabana
Your blood type it could be Tropicana
But you ain't got my juice

[Verse 3: Jesse Abraham]
Juice
It's what I choose
Requires one sip, requires no chews
You could drink it slow or quickly like Bruce
Please excuse if I'm being obtuse
I don't eat moose
I don't eat goose
Sometimes I eat produce and fruits
It's no use
There's no jukes you can use
Even Zeus with a noose can't refuse me some juice
All the girls know the real good juice spots
I say "hi" and put my straw in her juice box
It's odd how fruit was forbidden
But "be fruitful and multiply" is the rule we were given
The same way that the turtles had ooze
There's no hurtle cuz I'm fertile, I seduce with juice
Soon they're enthused
I bruise the caboose
Induce them to snooze
Once the juice gets loose

[Chorus]
Eyes filled with pride
Heart full of truth
Smile real wide
And my art is the proof
That my childish side
Is far from removed
I got that
I got that
got that
I got that juice
I got that juice
I got that juice
I got that juice
Hey yo, I got that juice
I got that juice
I got that
Got that
Got that
Got that
Got that</pre>
