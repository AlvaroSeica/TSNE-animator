[Game]
Walk up in the club with the million dollar Airs on
Swingin side to side, like my hair long
Feelin like Tunechi in this muh'fucker
Eyes Japanese, blowin sushi in this muh'fucker
No True Religions, just Levi's, come on down to this beehive
Your bitch love to play softball, I let her borrow them knee-highs
She ride the dick like yee-haw, she don't fuck with no cowboys
I beat it up like I'm He-Man, she love fuckin them key men
And after I score, I do the salsa in the
Victor Cruz in that Phantom, drop the antenna (uhh)
I think I see some haters in hurr
I think I see some haters in hurr
Cock the ratchet

[Chorus One: Game]
(Dawg) Cause them niggaz still mean muggin
Nigga what you lookin at?
(Dawg) You niggaz still mean muggin
What you lookin at?
(Dawg) You niggaz still mean muggin
Bitch what you lookin at?
(Dawg) You niggaz still mean muggin
Man, that shit don't even mean nothin

[2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
I say, yeah they mean muggin, the 3D version
Ugh, in your face, Pee Wee Herman
Jack of all trades, no Ace of Spades
But I got a ace in my twenty ounces Gatorade
Shake, shake, shake it then pour it
I had me a threesome, 'round 4-somethin
Hasta la vista, wrist on freezer
Automatic weapon, chopper had a seizure!
Fire! Snap back through your snap-back
Ran out of room in my trunk so I need a hatchback
Have you niggaz leakin, hope you niggaz listenin
Big money talk, why you niggaz whisperin?
Uhh!

[Chorus Two: Game]
Cause them niggaz still mean muggin
(Dawg) Nigga what you lookin at?
You niggaz still mean muggin
(Dawg) What you lookin at?
You niggaz still mean muggin
(Dawg) Bitch what you lookin at?
You niggaz still mean muggin
(Dawg) Man, that shit don't even mean nothin

[French Montana]
Montana! Game, what up?
Hah, Westside!

Roll up in the club like I own this motherfucker
Old niggaz kickin jewels, I'm like pawn them motherfuckers
Hoes +Wipe Me Down+, Little Boosie in this motherfucker
Rollin that +La-La+, Fugees in this motherfucker
I said Lala, Carmelo in this motherfucker
Shorty wanna +Puff+, J-Lo in this motherfucker
High rollers, bank stop, tattoos, tank tops
Bad news, thanks pop, your man food, lamb chops
You know I run my city, please believe that
Got that work with them canines on rehab
Niggaz lickin up their face, we gon' iron that
Get Rob Cole game, he gon' let you buy it back

[Chorus One]

[Outro: DJ Skee]
