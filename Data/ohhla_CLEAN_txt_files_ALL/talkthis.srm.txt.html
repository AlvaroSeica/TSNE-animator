[Verse One: Sam-bo]
Testing testing one, two, three
Chase a bitch, bitches run, to, me
Get strong money and it's funds, to, we
Got so many hustlers but I'm one, to, see
I get get it I got it I make it happen
Not a rap chp get every dollar I made of trappin
Call me major or captain, his mama made a Jackson
Huh, why? 'cause this is Thriller or sum'n
Big bat, big gat, like a killer or sum'n
Bulletproof the ride like a armadillo or sum'n
White square the same size as a pillow or sum'n
And hollow tips a eat your face like a pickle or sum'n
Uh! I'm not one to be fucked wit
'specially if it's involvin me duggin
Construction worker and I only work wit tough bricks
Got the dutch lit fuck around and get hit up quick

[Chorus: Sam-bo]
You could walk the way I walk, move the way I move
Talk the way I talk do the thangs that I do
But you still not me! You still not me!
Could have a whole 'lot of this, a whole 'lot of that
Wit a whole 'lot of bricks and a whole 'lot of stacks
But you still not me! You still not me!
No! No! No!

[Verse Two: Sam-bo]
Testing testing one, two, one
Sound easy just one with two, guns
Chase who I'm not the one, to, run
Now take that back I like to run, through, funds

Tryin to be Sam-b but trust me you ain't that
You think she know when over here bitch you stank that

All american oh me top three
And you can keep them things dog we got d

And all these karats on well best believe we got cheese  
Uh! And you don't turn the heads we turnin
Uh! And you don't burn the bread we burnin
Uh! Just say I state of head E. Sermon
The new green eyed bandit no E. Sermon

[Chorus: Sam-bo]
You could walk the way I walk, move the way I move
Talk the way I talk do the thangs that I do
But you still not me! You still not me!
Could have a whole 'lot of this, a whole 'lot of that
Wit a whole 'lot of bricks and a whole 'lot of stacks
But you still not me! You still not me!
No! No! No!

[Verse Three: Erick Sermon]
Testing testing one, two, three
Don't follow no one people fol-low, me

Anybody checkin my cash flow, cease the weapon
Some callin me legend, I'm sum'n like a blessin
Wonder, why, I'm like Stevie or sum'n
Big gat, stay strapped like I'm Weezy or sum'n
Thank God, go hard, like I'm Jeezy or sum'n

Uh! And you don't burn the bread we burnin
Pockets fat, we call it Sherman
It's the green eyed bandit, E. Sermon

[Chorus: Sam-bo]
You could walk the way I walk, move the way I move
Talk the way I talk do the thangs that I do
But you still not me! You still not me!
Could have a whole 'lot of this, a whole 'lot of that
Wit a whole 'lot of bricks and a whole 'lot of stacks
But you still not me! You still not me!
No! No! No!</pre>
