Now in the Bity of Bompton
LIME HOOD is down with the MOB
HOLLY HOOD and CROSS ATLANTIC off of Bompton Boulevard
Every town has an ELM STREET but not a Freddy Krueger
Don't get caught
In the JUNGLE's or a Park called LUEDERS
On Rosecrans pass Oleander at the light
TREE TOP is to the left, FRUIT TOWN is on the right
1-5-1's and WESTSIDE PIRUS slay past dark
And the only other Blood hood is CAMPANELLA PARK
HACIENDA, SWANS and BOUNTY HUNTERS'll call ya number
ROLLIN' 30's and 20's OUTLAWS, SIXX DEUCE BRIMS will put you under
CABBAGE PATCH, CENTER PARK, HARVARD PARK, ATHENS PARK too
SCOTTSDALE, NEIGHBORHOOD, HAWTHORNE, WATERFRONT, all Pirus
L.A. DENVER LANES, there's 'Roa and Pasadena
AVENUES, BLOOD STONE, INGLEWOOD FAMILY
The PUEBLOS, BLOOD STONE VILLIANS, BLACK P. STONE
CIRCLE CITY and EASTSIDE BISHOPS got it goin' on
With the M.G.'s, QUEEN STREET, V.N.G's ain't no stoppin' the
VILLAGE TOWN, EASTSIDE PAIN, CRENSHAW MAFIA
BE-BOP WATTS, CITY STONES and the SKYLINES
Don't say Cuz 'cause Blood, this is Piru all the time

[YOUNG MALCOLM]

Piruuuu Loooove
Bompton Piruuuuuu
Babyyyyyy

[LIL' STRETCH]
I got love for the Ru's I thought you knew jack
So guess who? Peek-a-boo! Lil Stretch is back
With that Tek-9 loaded hit the wall ??
Little young punks gettin' sprayed by the ride, punk
Uh, fools down by the curb side
Another Crab lost his life from the fury of a drive-by
Hunnas ain't playin' in the 9-Tramp
From the Ace to the 5 we peelin caps back to the fact
Bustin raps is kinda cool
Gettin' paid for these rhymes all the time don't twist it fool (oh yeah)
I thank God for the Blood Gang
Eastside Bounty Hunter Five Line is what I claim

[C.K.]
Once again it's your friend carrying a big Tek
I'll let the hollow points spit
I'm tearin' skin rollin through your set
Punk, it's me C.K. Bangin' On Wax
Now I'm bangin your girl while you out
Selling your nickle sacks
N-O-T-S non rappers out of the shelter
This is Dangerous for Record sales I guess we told ya
Piru Love is what we calling this track
Taking out all the Crabs, rippin skulls and breaking backs
Matter fact, anybody wanna battle: bring ya crew and watch
Dangerous teddy, bust up - like Terminator 2 (Awwww yeah)
Piru funky we dump on punks dissin' back
Shuda been a Piru, I thought you knew that it was like that

[REDRUM 781]
The settin is the world famous oneway
The homies banged up, meetin up on a sunday
Run across the street just to get some brews and shhhhh
What do you know? A Crab slippin' wearin flue and shhhhh
I take the flags out my pocket
Wrap it around my knuckles make a fist and lock it
Deposit - a blow to the jaw as I bank him
Break a 40 on top of the counter then I shank him
It's the Piru, the Piru
The G's with the rhymes, 4 clips shot Crabs 8 times with the 9
I got love from the West Side
Straight to the East Side
Rickets and Bloods
Both bump the B side up
This funk in your trunk is the bomb
Set trip, I put the pen and light it up like Vietnam
Pimps in red uniforms storin Crab sets
And I bet from here on now we gets more respect
Shouts to the Swans, V.N.G's, Lanes and W's, Redrum with the Avenue Piru Love

[Chorus]

[BLOODY MARY]
Rest In Peace to the homie Killa Wak
To Lil homie Kay Ron
O.G. Tookie, Iceberg
We Love Y'all (Shhhhh)
Westside Avenue Piru
B.H.I.P
To lil' homies from Eastside Bounty Hunter Watts
Lil' J
Lil Fang Fang
Denver
T.I.</pre>
