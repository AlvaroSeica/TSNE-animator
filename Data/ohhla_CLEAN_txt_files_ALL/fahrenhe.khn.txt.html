Verse 1:

I be the S-O-U to the fucking twelfth letter
Never change styles just so i can sell better
Been a lot of things but a fool ain't one
Got a food chain gun and the Wu-Tang's lungs
I spew flames from an esophagus
Clogged up with butane
You thinking, who came as hot as this
New age metropolis dude made in Optimus -
Prime's image? I'm living proof, ain't no stopping this
Small young whitey called "Khan Almighty"
Suckers get mad 'cause they're squad all likes me
What America wants most, since Ice went gold
Soul been nice since the ice been cold
I speak like each word emerged from the Lord himself
Even if it didn't, I guess it sort of helped
see, i ain't ever been afraid of global warming
'cause the same shit happens when soul's performing

Hook sung by Akie Bermiss:

The city's on fire and they trying to blame me
Fought with the Devil now he's trying to frame me
Nobody listens but parasites
'cause they don't know the meaning of fahrenheit
(repeats)

Verse 2:

I got that beast disease, I need a freak to please
A mix of Beyonce and Alicia Keys
Nah, she want a dude that's deep with cheese
So if i try to kick game,  I catch three degrees
And that frozen shoulder ain't ever going to turn
So here are a few of the things I'd burn
Cartier glasses and Louis V purses
The money of the fools that think that she's worth it
The Nikes of them white boys that all rock dunks
When four years ago they were hard rock punks
I'm more than my sneakers, torching your speakers
Got it on lock like the warden that greets you
Born with a fever, I'm holding a cleaver
To turn these pit bulls into golden retrievers
Told that my features ain't going to sell
I said you better hope that there ain't no hell

Hook sung by Akie Bermiss:

The city's on fire and they trying to blame me
Fought with the Devil now he's trying to frame me
Nobody listens but parasites
'cause they don't know the meaning of fahrenheit
