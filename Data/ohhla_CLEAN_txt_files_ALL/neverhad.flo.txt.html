[Verse One]
I see you sit and swallow pain
For all of those who will not speak
You raise your voice, you fill the stage
Your eyes are wide, you know the weakness
that you've felt is not just yours
So many more, you're not alone
The songs you sing are not your own
You left the room with somethin real

[Chorus]
You've never had it (you've never had it)
Keep on wantin somethin more (keep on wantin somethin more)
You've never had it (you've never had it)
Keep on wantin somethin more (keep on wantin somethin more)

[Verse Two]
You've never had it so you hesitate to try and find it
You listen carefully for whispers of what lurks behind it
You play the corners, never get too close to where it might be
waiting for you; never had it, keep on wantin something more
(Keep wanting more... you never had it)
(Keep wanting more... you never had it)
Keep hiding the hope, and then the pain is not yours
No one's holding a rope, you gotta pull it on your own
All the songs have been sung, and all the doors have been closed
Keep on wanting more (keep on wanting more)

{*skatting and ad libs*}

[Verse Three]
And I watch you wander through these halls
You slouch, you shrug, you shrink away
And I call you stop, you blink, you pause
You wonder who you think the day
will never end and, when it does
You wait until the building's dark
The doors are locked, you're on the bus
You looked inside but did not touch

[Chorus]

[Verse Four]
You've never had it but you know how to provide it so you
Stand up and call for it nervous describing what you go through
You don't wanna get caught up in all the things they say to try to provoke you
Don't need anyone to tell you, keep on wanting something more
(Keep wanting more... you never had it)
(Keep wanting more... you never had it)
Keep hiding the hope, and then the pain is not yours
No one's holding a rope, you gotta pull it on your own
All the songs have been sung, and all the doors have been closed
Keep on wanting more (keep on wanting more)
