[J-Live - Repeat 3X]
PEACE, Y'ALL! (PEACE Y'ALL)
PEACE, Y'ALL! (PEACE Y'ALL)
PE-DA-DEE-DA-DEE-DA-DEE-DA-DEECE, Y'ALL! (PEACE Y'ALL)

PE, DA-DEE, PE-PE, DA-DEE
PE-DA-DEE-DA-DEE-DA-DEE-DA-DEECE, Y'ALL!

First things first, I just - got through, goin through
this ordeal, dealin with deals, you know the deal
I've dealt with, bein dealt dirty, downsized
and duped, done double-paid my dues, for real
I just - know today's degree, C lesson
Not nowadays, can a record label fool me
So the understanding'll be 'The Best Part'
No need to guess how this rocky road was meant to be
I just - got home from a long tour
seashore to seashore, J-Live up the party
So, even if I'm unknown back home (say what)
Step out of the time zone, these folks came to see me!
I just - grab the mic, jump on the stage
Soak up the crowd, hittin 'em with page after page of
blood, sweat, tears, saliva, sperm, snot
shit, piss, throw-up, everything I GOT!
I just - let it all out, give it all back
like I got it, why? Cause I got it like that
I've been spotted by those that recognize the fact that
God is still black and bullshit is still wack! (wack!)

[J-Live - Repeat 3X]
PEACE, Y'ALL! (PEACE Y'ALL)
PEACE, Y'ALL! (PEACE Y'ALL)
PE-DA-DEE-DA-DEE-DA-DEE-DA-DEECE, Y'ALL! (PEACE Y'ALL)

PE, DA-DEE, PE-PE, DA-DEE
PE-DA-DEE-DA-DEE-DA-DEE-DA-DEECE, Y'ALL!</pre>
