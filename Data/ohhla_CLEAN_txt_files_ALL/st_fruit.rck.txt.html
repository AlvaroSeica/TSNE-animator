[Tragedy Khadafi]

Subliminal thug-ism
Rap mysticism
For all my niggas locked with life in state prison
We combinate, like dime piece and sperm jizm
Queens niggas going to trial, just sit and listen
Fake crooks come in all types of categories
Beat you in the head with lies and war stories
Claiming that they name ring bells in territories
With Fat Cat, Al Capone, Scarface
Meanwhile they going to trial for rape case
You weak, I punch you in face, cut your face
You halfway, wanna-be thug, stay snitchin'
Latin King, surgery-type with face stichin'
The house game? missle style? play in the kitchen
Allow me a god for real, Sallah position
Performers, weak convicts you shouldn't fool wit
They foul, snitchin' on the niggas they went to school wit
But now, you catch them in the club on some smooth shit
shuh-poww!! blow'em out the frame on some prove shit
I'm not the type of cat you wanna fool wit
It's strange fruit...

Chorus
[Tragedy Khadafi]

The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth

[Pete Rock]

The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth

[Tragedy Khadafi]

The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth

[Pete Rock]

The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth

[Cappadonna]

A yo, the world plant seeds in my mind, then it's dart time
They used to be crime, scary hours, robberies, and big chrome nines
In Park Hill, when the cameras don't never be off
I live inside the TV, these words is hot sauce
Put your mind back together, Killa Bees of course
Church in the studio life you can't abort
Pete Rock and Don make the world pay child support
You under arrest for giving out stress, i'm not settling for less
Each bags?, Midtown, in the wild, wild west
Representin some deep impact
Aluminum Wu bat, I got it like dat, slang combat
I plant two seeds in your head, kid stand back...

[Chorus]

[Pete Rock]

What, What, What...
The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth

[Tragedy Khadafi]

The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth

[Pete Rock]

The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth

[Tragedy Khadafi]

The world plant seeds in my mind, strange fruit
Survivalist, basing my life on rap loot, it's the truth

[Sticky Fingaz]

Nigga you know better
I blow three thru ya ? sweater
Fuck what you think
I'm bustin you blink
Nigga see me in the club, start ducking and tucking they link
Like I resorted to robbing niggas for table scraps
In the hood we do away with cats
And in the river with throw away the gats
Everywhere i go turn crime scene
Knowhatimean?#!?
Don't make me trip, make me flip
Be so much bloodshed, you think i'm a Crip
Even before I signed the contract, always was respected
Couldn't give a fuck if a sold another record
I ain't in it for the cream
As wild as it seem
Battle me and win? hahahah!!!! not in your dreams!!
I'm still a young nigga
Straight up dumb nigga
For no apparent reason, pull out the gun nigga
It's not the drugs nigga
I just a thug nigga
So whatcha wanna swallow,
Your pride or your blood nigga??!!??
