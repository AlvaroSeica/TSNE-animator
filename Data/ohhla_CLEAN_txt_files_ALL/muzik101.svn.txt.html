Let the music take your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind

[Intro: Lebo]
Yeah, Ay man, I can remember we was all sittin in front of the homie's apartment
Bangin The Fat Boys, Jail wit no bail, Man
And stick em, Those was some classics, Man
Have our tastes so

[Verse 1: Lebo]
It's the R-A-To the K-I-Am
If I wasn't, Then why would I say I am?
Microphone fiend, Eric B. for prez
I used to slum and blast er till my batteries went dead
All ravishing I impress
See courageous or care less
K for the pegos that I got
That I wear everyday cause why is why not
Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh
La di da di, That {shit} was the mess
Heels, Tall Bikini's, Small, She says she likes the ocean
I used to reenact that video wit the homeboys, Movin my hands to that particular slogan
I'm bad, Ladies Love Cool James
Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay
Uh

[Sevin]
That's right, Nigga
Gotta educate these cats, Ya know
Seems like they forgot
It's music 101, Ya know
It's our culture
My nigga just gave you a little bit of hip hop history
I'ma go head and bring it through the vocals next

[Verse 2: Sevin]
Uh, Uh, This is somethin like The Temptations memories
Or Ray Charles blessing us wit visions through his melodies
Stephanie Mills, Part a spurge wit her eternal love
And Keith Sweat taught us what makin it last forever was
The skys are breakin, These times and days
As if we somehow lost that lovin feelin for Issac Hayes
I pray everyday some way we bring it back alive
And maybe get one more chance wit the Jackson 5
Al Green made the people stand up in every club
And what I felt for Sade was no ordinary love
Marvin got us through the inner city blues from dark streets
And you got it crackin on the bad one to the Isleys
Wit so much passion, That you skip Five Heartbeats
Jimi Hendrix was like a trends
And Chaka taught us life's so tense
Bill Whithers bought us through the lonely towns and lonely streets
But Stevie Wonder kept us feelin overjoyes and so at peace

[Lebo]
That's right, Sevin

[Sevin]
You know that

[Lebo]
It's an easy thang

[Sevin]
Sho is, My nigga

[Lebo]
Driftin down memory lane
We love to sit tight reminiscing
Ah huh

[Sevin]
Take 'em back one more time, Lebo
Take 'em back through that hip hop thang

[Verse 3: Lebo]
I had the shelltoes wit no shoestrings
Bang Kurtis Blow's song, It's called survival
Only the strong will survive
That was Grandmaster Flash &amp; The Furious Five
Krs and BDP, UTFO, And EPMD
Big Daddy Kane, Flavor Flav, And Chuck D
My uzi weighs a ton, Public Enemy

[Uncredited Singer] [Lebo]
Forever my lady
Back, Back, Forth, Forth [Rest in peace to Aaliyah]
You just a girlfriend [Y'all remember true?]
Seems like yesterday
I can lick you up and down till you say stop
Because you give me love, love, love, love, crazy love</pre>
