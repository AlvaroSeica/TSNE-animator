Song:   Love Bullets
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Love will be the armor
Protect us from the pain
In our life, in our life
Even when the storm comes
We'll stand out in the rain
Watch it slide, live inside

Here we stand against the world

You and I we rock the lullaby
Make me feel alive, cause the love will never day
Me put you long one
Shot me down and we're gone
Ain't no need to worry, don't call 911
Bang-bang, a lot of bang-bang
Shoot me with your love and got me feeling no pain
Kill it, kill it baby with your love even, bang bang
Baby, do it again

So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet

Even if you're mad at me
And fighting all the time
It's alright, it's alright
I would risk my sanity
I would lose my mind
For one night, for one night

Here we stand against the world

You and I we rock the lullaby
Make me feel alive, cause the love will never day
Me put you long one
Shot me down and we're gone
Ain't no need to worry, don't call 911
Bang-bang, a lot of bang-bang
Shoot me with your love and got me feeling no pain
Kill it, kill it baby with your love even, bang bang
Baby, do it again

So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet</pre>
