[Intro]
Jay Exclusive...

[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
I smoke that purple haze, I smoke that purple kush
I smoke that palm berry, I smoke that blueberry
I smoke that blue haze, I smoke that double dutch
I smoke that hydroponic, I smoke that chronic bud
I smoke that white widow, I smoke that lemon skunk
I smoke that hard weed, I smoke that Cali mist
I smoke that hash plant, I smoke that crystal shit
I smoke that bubble gum, I smoke that cannabis

[Rubbabandz]
Yeah, Smokin good, Drinkin good, Yeah I put that on my hood
Stapleton Project, Burn it down, I wish a nigga would
Staten Island New York, We burn how we wanna burn
Shoot at the police, We earn like we wanna earn
Fuck a homo thug, We don't play that shit around here
You can get handicapped, I aint shootin in the air
Please believe me when I tell you I aint shootin in the air
Play with Bandz if you want, Gun shots everywhere
Light one up so I can smoke, Let me show you how to choke
Inhale-Inhale, Exhale nope, Gotta hold it till your lungs burn
Till it come back around, Wait until it's your turn
Shot gun, Put it down, So high, Feel like I'm walkin on a cloud
Show time, Purple kush got me jumpin in the crowd
Feet first, Ear drums burst, Niggas too loud
Smokin good, So high, Bet ya niggas know...

[Chorus]

[Rubbabandz]
The city that never sleeps, Eyes blood shot red
You could roll an ounce of dro, Better not take it to the head
I don't like to share weed, Niggas got herpes
Big bumps on your mouth, Smoke wit ya, Nigga please
And your weed got more seeds then ODB
And Peep Game put together times three
That's that bootleg, Like at ease, Don't even want that
You can go back to the backyard and pump that
I need that chopper green, That AK-47
When you smoke it it'll put you in a dope fiend
I mean dope fiend, Like you sippin lean
If you smokin on the job better get a box of visine

[Chorus]</pre>
