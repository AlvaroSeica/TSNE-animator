Typed by: chaloveli@gmail.com

I hope it can work out tonight
I know we been seein' each other for a long time
and (hahaha) I'm hopin' tonight can be the night...
yeah, that's right

[2Pac]
another shady mission
had enough of shady tricks
you so suspicious like watchin' pictures in hatin' vision
tonight is love making
take you any place you wish
today we satisfy
cause they were stolen kisses
blind insanity
perfect pictures of me and my family
not understanding the destiny
that they planned for me
if I have kids will I live to see' em grow?
well I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
more broken promises
a sacred bond broken
I know I'll die alone
but yet and still I'm hopin'
visions of prisons
maybe I'll be forgiven
I know its better in heaven cause bein' here ain't living
close my eyes and see nothing but pain the world's crazy
still look for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
maybe I'll be the one
or maybe I'm lost
you'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

(chorus: K-Ci and JoJo)
If you play your cards right, everything will be alright
if you play your cards right, tonight will be the night
(repeat 2x)

[Big Syke]
I'm always in the mix
life is full of tricks
I guess, tryin' my best, nothing less
before I lay to rest
my quest in future I mourn like new born baby
intense before a world so crazy
my daddy raised me to be a man
to do the best I can
he said you won't succeed in life without a plan
Its hard to take what's in my trait
within hate
can't wait, better change before its too late

[Mopreme]
they got me at the bottom of a deck searching for my ace
I can't take too many chances
ain't much love in the place
full of torment and soul and its written all in my face
problems inside quick to smile beyond the trace
a mission slightly incomplete
misconceptions of success and defeat
I roam these dark streets alone
searching for my homies, smokin' till I'm gone
when I kind of need someone to lay my burdens on

Chorus 2x</pre>
