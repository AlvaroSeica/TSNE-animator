[First Verse]
In fuzzy focus, he sees downtown
A blue pick-up that's kinda rusted
Mystery formed a process of pain with faces dusted
Or a red cap to a crack vial in front of a crack pipe
He sees a cat on it's last life
A Father, never mistaken for a dad
Never mistaken by a guy that never had
He sees Heaven's fallen angel place a hand upon a mother
and wipe the tears away
Tell 'em it will be alright (alright!)
So, sleep tight, cus sleep might
Be the perfect escape for a man who leaves you in the night
So, sleep soundly and sleep good
It's the last words before he clips his wings for good
Arch-Angelic, My chemical hard apprenticeship
You can't learn to be outspoke by another marksman's shit.
That's inherent
It's build things or hop in the crosshairs.
Hard to kill an Angel, that's apparent.

[Chorus]
Mama drinks pepsi, Papa drinks gin
Papa gets drunk and a relationship begins
Papa, lady, Liquor form a love that won't break
Mama caught them cheating, it was too much to take
Baby had an angel, baby had a dad
Baby had nothing but a reason to be mad
But Baby's got a Mama and a roll of duct tape
and that's something, They got a love that won't break

[Second Verse]
Bringing it right back to the wrong fucking side of a man
Bringing it right back to a psalm and a backhand
A sad man, got up, waited by a trash can
What is he? Five or six years old?
There is no angel no more
Just a Devil with a jones that he can't stand.
A level pass high, passed by, he can't land.
Last chance, Last chance, last possible second to advance.
But you left him in the distance, nothing but resistance
Nothing but pissed pants and anger
How can you explain that you're dead when you're a stranger.
You talk to it, you dodge bullets, thank god you're swift
They cough up blood and choke on it
You're not needed, you're not welcome back here in Minneapolis
You're not worth shit, you're not worth shit, You're not worth shit
Put that in your crack pipe and smoke it the fuck up
Alright

[Chorus]
Mama drinks pepsi, Papa drinks gin
Papa gets drunk and a relationship begins
Papa, lady, Liquor form a love that won't break
Mama caught them cheating, it was too much to take
Baby had an angel, Baby had a dad
Baby had nothing but a reason to be mad
But Baby's got a Mama and a roll of duct tape
And that's something, they got a love that won't break

[Whispered Chorus]
Drinks Pepsi, Drinks Gin
Gets Drunk, Begins
Papa, Lady, liquor form a love that won't break
It's too much to take (to take)
Had an Angel, had a Dad
Baby had nothing but a reason to be mad
and a roll of duct tape
and that's something
They got a love that won't break (won't break)

[Modified Chorus and Outro]
Mama drinks pepsi, Papa drinks gin
Papa gets drunk and a relationship begins
Papa, lady, Liquor form a love that won't break
Mama caught them cheating, it was too much to take
Baby had an angel, baby had a mom who could take the pain for him
