Take a good look at it,look at it now
Might be the last time you'll have a good round
I'll let you touch it if you'd like to go down
I'll let you go further
If you take the southern route
Don't go too fast, don't go too slow
You've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive and I like 'em in control

1-Baby it's yours, all yours
  If you want it tonight
  I'll give you the red light special
  All through the night
  Baby it's yours, all yours
  If you want it tonight
  Just come through my door
  Take off my clothes
  And turn on the red light

I know that you want me
I can see it in your eyes
You might as well be honest
'Cause the body never lies
Tell me your secrets and I, I'll tell you mine
I'm feelin' quite sexy and I want you for tonight

If I move too fast just let me know
'Cause it means you move too slow
I like some excitement
And I like a man that goes
(repeat 1)

If you want me let me know it
I'll make time but you've got to show it
If you need me, I want to see
But don't mistake me
I don't want you down on your knees
I need someone, a real man,
I need someone who understands
I'm a woman, a real woman
I know just what I want
I know just who I am
