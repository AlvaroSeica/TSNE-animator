[Intro]
Bruh, I do NOT.. fuck wit a lot of niggaz bruh
They see me they gon' see me solo bruh
These pussy-ass niggaz out here too creep for me, bruh
These niggaz is not gon' snake me, bruh
Ya'll call them niggaz y'all homeboys
Crackers call y'all organization

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Stay in my own lane, mind my own bidness
Hit my own licks, and get my own pennies
Keep these niggaz from 'round me cause I ain't friendly
You'll never slide up under me and be my co-defendant

[Plies]
Time to do bidness, drop niggaz off
Never run to them crackers on me 'bout what ya saw
Never snake me, and get me knocked of
Niggaz like hoes, love to run they fuckin' mouth
Speak to 'em in the streets, won't bring them to my house
I don't trust na'an bitch, north or the south
Won't be around me tryin to scope it out
That super friendly shit, ain't about
I don't know him, keep him from 'round me
Tryin to peep somethin? What you tryin to see?
Never get that close to find out where I be
I don't know that nigga, get him from 'round me

[Chorus]

[Plies]
Niggaz come around, guess what? I stopped talkin
Holla at'chu niggaz later, grab my shit and start walkin
Fuck that shit, I done seen too much
It seem niggaz scope niggaz and gettin niggaz touched
Get in friends wit niggaz, turn 'round and set 'em up
Even my own dogs talk to 'em bout certain stuff
My own friends come around, nigga I hush
Outside of courtrooms, nigga I done seen enough
Time to get money, I'm so low
Fo' deep doin business, that's a no-no
Cause what a nigga thinkin, you will never know
But do my own time nigga if I have to go

[Chorus]

[Plies]
I don't fuck wit no nigga, who got a lot of friends
Cause you never know, who that nigga want to win
You vibe wit too many niggaz you spread yourself then
And them the type of niggaz, know everybody business then
Nigga too friendly, no tellin who he with
You niggaz fuck wit any nigga you thank do it big
Guaranteed you will never slide up under kid
I keep my eyes open, and my fire hid
That's how I stay away, from all the fuck shit
I gotta couple homeboys but I don't run with clique
The least a nigga know, the less he can snitch
I run solo, so I don't have to kill a bitch

[Chorus]</pre>
