Alright N.A., it's a couple years after Justine
I think this bitch is barely legal enough for us to work with right now
No we don't want no motherfuckin free tour guides, know what I'm sayin?
And no fuckin free stress tests either, y'know we out here workin
Wendy, what's happenin? Let 'em know what you are baby, like that
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, itty bitty, itty bitty
Itty bitty bitty bitty bitty BITCH~!

Daisy Duck animated, just graduated
Old niggaz have to love it, old sluts have to hate it
It's kind of silly, but she turned into the eye of the tigerlily
Right after she learned how to ride a willy
My one woman street team
Ass fat enough to be a billboard for her Lee Jeans
Her hustle SENSATIONAL! I gave her just one copy
of the invitational and we were both paid in full
I'm like her Daddy Warbucks
She makes me look tres chic, at all the couture clubs
Better advertisement, than my picture on a tourbus
My micro mini knows how to use her youth as a shortcut
She's fresh out of high school, senior year
Although she appears of age to legally drink a beer
Saw her at my show and had to ask what brings you here
Couldn't hear her over the noise in my ringin ears
But I gave her a CD
And now a bunch of peeps I don't know come to my shows to see me
And I get mad MySpace friend requests
Not knowin it's Wendy that got me in this mess
Now it may sound like a complaint, but it ain't
Wendy showin me love that I'm not tryin to taint
Cause of her, it's easier for my name to circulate
It's like I gone fishin and I got the perfect bait

[Chorus]
This is for my, Mega micro mini miss
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitch
Soon as she get grown then she won't fuck with me
Put my Peter pants on so you don't grow up Wendy!
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty BITCH~!
Wendy where you at? Wha-wha-Wendy where you at?
Wha-wha-Wendy wha-Wendy, wha-wha-Wendy where you at? (BITCH~!)

My Wendys ain't scholars, they only enrolled in L.A. City College
To catch niggaz student loan dollars
I hit her up after school, she's still in metal shop
But somehow knows to use that ass as a tool
She can work them legs to walk you right into the show
Caress your left hand while the right one spends the dough
When they tell you the price she whispers in your ear
You'll trick half your stack just because you can't hear
Put your ass in the seat when she wiggles her rear
Then licks her lip one time so you can buy her a beer
And then without even stayin the night
The 2:12 bus makes her curfew before the street lights
Things with Wendy were wonderful until a couple months ago
when she stopped comin to my shows
I tried to track her down, I even asked around
I looked everywhere, but Wendy can't be found
And as much as I want her to come back again
I realize that all good things have to end
My shows ain't as crowded as when she packed 'em in
And it's been a week since someone tried to add me as a friend
But you know what's kind of bugged?
I saw her outside a club promotin some rapper that looked like a thug
Had me trippin like shoes with loose strings
But I ain't even mad ma, keep doin your thing

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Itty bitty, itty bitty, bitty bitty
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
City bitty, itty bitty, bitty bitty
So itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
She itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
Wendy's itty bitty, bitty bitty, bitty bitty
She's my itty bitty fo fitty itty bitty fo fitty
Itty bitty, bitty bitty, itty bitty, bitty BITCH~!

Yeah it's 2008
We runnin 'em back N.A.
Y'knahmsayin, these niggaz to get they street teams up
Knahmsayin? My Wendy got more energy than a motherfucker
She out there with a Monster drinkin and a handful of fires nigga
Y'knahmsayin it's the motherfuckin butcher, once again
Who else was it gon' be, y'knahmsayin?
Drop this shit out nigga
It's Wendy, "True Hollywood Squares" motherfuckers
