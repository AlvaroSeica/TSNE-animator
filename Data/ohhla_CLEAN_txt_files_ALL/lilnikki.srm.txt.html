[Intro: Twon Gabz] (Erick Sermon)
Heh Ha Ha! Yeah! Yeah we here! (Fo' sho')
Huh! Twon G! (Erick Sermon)
Whattup?! (Chillin!) I know I am (True!)
Look at her E! (I see her!)
Owwwwww!!!

[Verse One: Erick Sermon]
Uh! I'm in the spot somewhere in the city (Yeah)
Hey Lil Nikki come Minaj with me 
No disrespect hun that there's a metaphor (Uh Huh!)
If you ain't wanna talk to her why you get her for?!
All that ass there got you all twisted
She walked passed here before but you missed it
Struttin so hard but I dissed it, watched it work (Yeah!)
She come back but 'cause I resisted, church!
Speak! Hair color like red, blue, green, blonde (Uh Huh!)
Implants got the ass comin out the thong
DJ playin my favorite song
Go stupid, Ass Ass by Big Sean (Owww!!!)
Nothin new I'm doin me a true believer
Make her laugh, spend no Cash, Money neither (NAH!!!)
Speak the ill shit to her like a poem (Huh!)
Stupid nigga spittin game to her tried hoe her (Stupid!)
Sidebar that scene last night
Me and Nas, Rakim, up in Queens last night (OHHHHH!!!)
Back to her, baby is mean shit!!!
Crazy, Cee-Lo Green shit, you've seen this

[Chorus]
Lil Nikki! Girl you so fine you need to get with me
And I seen no time to give you explicit
Girl your one of a kind so let's go get lifted
Is you with me, can you see what I see?
Oh! Yeah! Oh! Yeah! Oh! Yeah!

[Verse Two: Twon Gabz]
BDP said, the girls look so good but there brain's out
Somethin like a body dress but her brain's...not
Huh! So that means it's not ready yet
I bet that's the reason she not married yet
She ain't no time spent you can't make back
Chasin dudes she think made that a Maybach
She let 'em hit her yeah hit her not Hitler like Adolph 
Ponzi schemed her then Madoff
Huh! I'm tryin to cuff her like an in scene
No sleep then stroke deep like a swim team
She worth more then what all the ballers got
Why she sellin herself short like a pawn shop
I had to let her know what her value was
A Diamond, a zirconium is what she thought she was
She been through alot said her life was hard
Told her that only mean to pray twice as hard
Took her life, gave her new lease on it
Took her ring finger put a piece on it
Hoodrats drink Crown Royal and bust down
But you my queen now so you where a royal crown.....Nikki

[Chorus]
Lil Nikki! Girl you so fine you need to get with me
And I seen no time to give you explicit
Girl your one of a kind so let's go get lifted
Is you with me, can you see what I see?
Oh! Yeah! Oh! Yeah! Oh! Yeah!</pre>
