[CL Smooth]
Let me show you how life is a bitch; when a man strapped in C4
can walk up in a restaurant and detonate the switch
High levels of the chemical poison, fearless, death to the infidels
A lot of chess play, hidden in them cells
Deep inside a neighborhood, of upstanding citizens
in the middle of a holy war worth billions
In the clutches of a sheik, who let his oil wealth speak
that got these suit and tie crackers up in power come 'n seek
With the market and the lawyer that's a done deal for ya
With terrorism feedin off fear and paranoia
Got your Homeland Security, now they get braver
Let 'em tap all your lines, now you feel safer
Just invade all your privacy, the lesson every day
They'll reserve for you to stay in Guantanamo Bay
You wanna blow buildings up, and hijack planes
In world war, who's to blame? They'll never be the same
Only hardship and pain
It's the LP "American Me," stay tuned...</pre>
