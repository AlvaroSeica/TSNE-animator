[Intro]
Nah, I think you did it
At least I can have my people to make it look like you did it
They never caught the boyfriend
And there ain't statute limitations on murder
Shit, I done time before, shit
Not for murder you haven't
And this is murder one

[Chorus]
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
Shot my DA, know he still tryna endite me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
Had to cut them niggaz off, they wasn't like me

[Verse 1]
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
G checkin it, that's unlikely
Rollin on the pill bitch I might be
Money, cars and women and excitement
In a foreign whip I make the tires smoke
I'm sippin purple drink, Floka got the fire smoke
Riders hanging out that window like what's happenin nigga
And I'm they captain nigga, point em out, they clappin nigga
Patron got me movin like a mad man
Show up to your concert, I'm the Sandman
Drag these niggaz off stage and take a bow nigga
Real niggaz round me you ain't allowed nigga

[Chorus]
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
Shot my DA, know he still tryna endite me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
Had to cut them niggaz off, they wasn't like me

[Verse 2]
All the money and the fame don't excite me
I got niggaz in the pen you call lifers
Ain't nothing but shooters in my cipher
Reach for my chain fuck around and start a riot
Now the only thing I'm duckin is a endite
Got my shooters on deck like what's the assignment
Now they're blowin money,
Couble racks and the king of diamonds
Had to cut the bitch off, think she tried to lie me
Aks about me in the streets, bet they co-sign me
Yeah that nigga Louie fresh, off the highway
Met him cross the lobby dome like Tony

[Chorus]
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
Shot my DA, know he still tryna endite me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
All I need is some niggaz that's just like me
Had to cut them niggaz off, they wasn't like me</pre>
