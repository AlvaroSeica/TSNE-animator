[Kevin Cossom]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeaaaah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I'm feeling myself, pause
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like the haters never take a night off
But you know I'ma tell them that they can get lost
cause I'm feeling myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm gon' ball like I'm seven feet tall
I don't know about y'all, but I'ma get off
cause I'm feeling myself

[Pusha T]
Oh what a feeling, the champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathing in millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling
Still up on my Nino, smelling like a kilo
But I'm down in fresh soft white like my pillow
Feeling myself, so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
under bright lights, middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feeling myself

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
Baby take a chance, never mind what you're hearing
I can change your life, tell me what are you comparing?
Put you on the red carpet, tell 'em what you're wearing
Shop till you drop, they say sharing is caring
More than my winnings, we can share opinions
Like baby steps, we can share beginnings
Walk before you run, but she so independent
that I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
We so real, got my own quarter mill'
Counting money on the bed, watching Deal or No Deal
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feeling myself, pause, hahaha

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
I propose a toast to every living kingpin
Smart enough to delegate they work to their wingman
Keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling hand
Played my cards right, now I'm looking a dream hand
Yeah, got you looking at my pokerface
No joker see it, you can call me Smoking Ace
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feeling myself

[Chorus]</pre>
