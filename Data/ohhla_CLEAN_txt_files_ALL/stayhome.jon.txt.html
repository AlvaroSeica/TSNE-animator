Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm a stay-at-home dad
I'm on paternity leave
I'm a stay-at-home dad
It's just my baby and me
I'm a stay-at-home dad
While my wife's at work I've got a bottle in my hand and spit up on my shirt

Baby wakes me up around 5 am
Kicking and screaming until his face turns red
He usually tends to calm down once he's fed
So I give him his bottle
My wife gets out of bed
Cook my wife breakfast while she's getting ready
O-oh, o-oh someone's diaper is smelly
O-oh, o-oh it leaked all over his belly
O-oh, o-oh it looks like mustard and jelly
Kiss my wife goodbye while I clean up his bum-bum
It's time for his bath this is gonna be fun fun
I try not to get soap in his eyes
He really doesn't like it, it makes him cry
But if he cries, to make him stop, I've got a trick
I make funny noises with my mouth like this
Then we play pick-a-boo it makes him laugh

I'm a stay-at-home dad
It's a full time job
I'm a stay-at-home dad
But I like it a lot
I'm a stay-at-home dad
During his afternoon nap I watch 'The Price is Right' and I make myself a snack
Cheese and crackers

If I have errands to run I take the van
Strap him in his car seat and bring his baby bag
I always make sure his seat's well strapped in
My baby security is important

Groceries, pay some bills, visit grandma
But I gotta make sure to be back by 4 o'clock so I can prepare supper while I watch Oprah
What should I make tonight maybe some pasta
And a caesar salad my wife will like that

5 o'clock is the time that she comes back
She asks me how my day was
I say not bad
It's all in a day's work as a stay-at-home dad

I'm a stay-at-home dad
I don't take drugs
I'm a stay-at-home dad
I get high on baby hugs
I'm a stay-at-home dad
I like Winnie the Pooh but my favourite Disney movie is the Lion King 2

I also like Ice Age

That's right I take care of my children</pre>
