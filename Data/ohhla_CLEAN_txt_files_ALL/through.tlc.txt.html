[Verse 1]
Been a minute since I seen you
I just been killin time
Lettin all these niggas know
That you gon always be mine
Disappeared and reappeared
We held it down through the years
All the crazy shit we been through
Cant take no more tears
Fell in love when I first met you
Put you all on my team
Introduced you to my crew
Told you my every dream
It was us against the world
Nobody could come between
Passionate, crazy, if you know what I mean
Cant wait to get back wit you soon as I come off tour
Musta felt me thinkin bout us there you are at the door
Both been doin our thing, but aint a damn thing changed
Always, remember that
Love me through all the pain

[Chorus: Ryan Toby, Claudette Ortiz]
Borrowed Time
I feel the same
Yes in my eyes
Itll never change
Youll always be my sunshine
Lasting through my rain
True will never die
Real love is here to stay
Even through the pain

[Verse 2]
Remember we was twenty deep
We used to mob every show
Whole crew couldnt be faded
Straight untouchable flows
Faithful few stayed down
Whether Im rich or Im broke
Trees by the pound, take two tokes
Straight to the bar, serve my entourage
All eyes on us, know you seein some stuff
In the club plus shoutin
You would get cussed out
My crew, come through, too wile no doubt
Anytime you ever needed me I always came through
Took your career inside my hands and represented for you
Its just a matter of time, before we all gon shine
Thats real, one love, representin for mine

[Chorus: Ryan Toby, Claudette Ortiz]
Borrowed Time
I feel the same
Yes in my eyes
Itll never change
Youll always be my sunshine
Lasting through my rain
True will never die
Real love is here to stay
Even through the pain

[Bridge: Ryan Toby, Claudette Ortiz]
And I know no matter where I may go (may go)
You will always be the angel watching over my shoulder

Even if were worlds apart Im drawn to you
Baby its ok, its parta something well do

[Verse 3]
We started out this game together
Took it straight to the top
Grew from shorties into women
We was neva gon stop
Just overpowerin this industry like heavy weighters
Risk takers, the hit makers, and no mistakers
And my whole clique, so sick, like liquid butter-shit
We spit incredible MTV buzzclips
Full grown, off on our own, congratulations
On your newborn child and the weddin situation
No we still all know
That we live and we learn
Come through every situation crossin bridges we burnt
And we still the biggest thing the industries eva seen
Thats T-L-C: The Unstoppable Team

[Chorus: Ryan Toby, Claudette Ortiz]
Borrowed Time
I feel the same
Yes in my eyes
Itll never change
Youll always be my sunshine
Lasting through my rain
True will never die
Real love is here to stay
Even through the pain

[Bridge: Ryan Toby, Claudette Ortiz]
Even through the pain
Well see brighter days
Cuz real love is hear to stay
Even through the pain

Even through the pain
Well see brighter days
Cuz real love is hear to stay
Even through the pain</pre>
