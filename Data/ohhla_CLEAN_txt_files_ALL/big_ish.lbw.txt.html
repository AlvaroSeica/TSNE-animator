Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Still balling
Stutting on them hoes
Yea you know just how it goes
I talk big big shit nigga
All my girls got asses like Trina
But they thick just like Serina
I talk big big shit nigga
Haha and if its new you know I'm in it
At the mall popping tags
I talk big big shit nigga

Hey boy I'm too paid
Pair of new jays they fresher than toothpaste
I don't mean to stunt on you niggas
But fuck it stunna told me that go ahead stunt on you niggas
Man you better get your girl
Your girl is all on me
She say I'm way cuter in person
Better than on TV
I'm fucking girls in a pent house
Ocean view baby
Geedies to your girl shes been coming over lately
And all you new rappers you're just new bait
Fucking throw them in my cage
I'm the lion your stake
Ymcmb nigga, and I'm the best thing smoking
Come see nigga
What it is!

Still balling
Stutting on them hoes
Yea you know just how it goes
I talk big big shit nigga
All my girls got asses like Trina
But they thick just like Serina
I talk big big shit nigga
Haha and if its new you know I'm in it
At the mall popping tags
I talk big big shit nigga

Are we still talking money (damn)
Can we switch the subject
Fuck a swatch watch, my nigga this a Rolex
Ah, I'm gettin Hollywood paper now
If they already wasn't them haters gone hate me now
Hoppin off the mother fucking G5 with stunna
F430 mr. burn rubber
Furniture from Italy
Light marble floor
Do not be alarmed thats just my butler at the door
And I got my own chef, I dont even eat out
Body guards on pay role, ready to knock your teeth out
Buying all the bottles, chillen with some models
Balling everyday like, I hit the lotto

Still balling
Stutting on them hoes
Yea you know just how it goes
I talk big big shit nigga
All my girls got asses like Trina
But they thick just like Serina
I talk big big shit nigga
Haha and if its new you know I'm in it
At the mall popping tags
I talk big big shit nigga</pre>
