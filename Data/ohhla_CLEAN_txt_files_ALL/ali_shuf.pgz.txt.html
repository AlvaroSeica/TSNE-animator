Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Suede Air Stabs, shaved hair cut
Black Evisu's with one leg cuffed
Bape up top with the raider's death touch
Obese knuckle duster, take the head off
Oh! Felling better now, polo frames keep the weather out
Stainless tag keeps ahead of now
Terry towel Kangol, ready to wet the crowd
Tipsy off the breath of Jennifer's wedding vows
Take ya best shot, we can box for twenty rounds
Believed in myself so nobody could tear me down
Building confidence like a Bricky's callous'
And fifty thousand dark and risky challenges
People wrote me off like Jason Donovan
Every breath I take's a waste of oxygen
Now my names synonymous with great accomplishments
Ultimate Hater couldn't shake my confidence

[Hook]
Gotta work hard to not break the hearts that love you
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle
The rest is all show, the rest is all show
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle

[Verse 2]
I didn't wait for a deal to get my name on the bill
I came up on my own, putting faith in the skill1
Hitting switches on the grave shift radio real
Pushing cherry bar battles didn't pay the bills
But it laid the foundation, gave me salvation
Taught me how to handle the biz without patience
They said I'd never make it off Central Station
And I exceeded everyone's expectations
Gotta do my thing cause death is waiting
Like desperate housewives on medication
Oh! feeling better now, ready to get it out
More conviction than a politician's rent-a-crowd
Spitting a phrase with hip-hop relevance
Gripping the breaks like six pot callipers
Scum's so dirty, can't rinse off elements
Building confidence like a kid's intelligence

[Hook - x2]
Gotta work hard and not break the hearts that love you
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle
The rest is all show, the rest is all show
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle

[Verse 3]
I'm feeling optimistic but it's hard to come through
Cause making music's not half the struggle
Gotta work hard and not break the hearts that love you
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle
Boo yah boo yah, take a glimpse of the future
No crystal ball, we got kids in the schoolyard
Kings on the street like linked by computer
Clockers on the rooftop singing like a crooner
No pain, no gain, some drown, some break
Some people just survive to tell their fate
Some dedicate everything to elevate
Some fall off and only got themselves to blame
I'm not intimidating, it's not a competition
I'm building confidence every song I've written
Trynna, push my sounds beyond the limits
Like the Wu-Tang tape in my Honda Civic

[Hook]
Gotta work hard and not break the hearts that love you
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle
The rest is all show, the rest is all show
The rest is all show like the Ali Shuffle</pre>
