Typed by: AZ Lyrics

All you motherfuckers
Turn it up let it (bounce)
In the trunk let it (bounce)
Throw em up let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch

This is what we do when
We verbally turn em out
With the speakers to the
Maximum baby just let it
Bounce now

In a crowd let it (bounce)
Turn it loud let it (bounce)
Blow em out let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch

This is what we do when I
Show em what I'm about
With the speakers to the
Maximum baby just let it
Bounce

It's that evil rap nemesis Putting together sentences
Faster than that hedgehog Running on Sega Genesis
Higher than the hoops of Pegasus And let the pencil hit the paper
Harder than a bus, Jerome Bettis it
Let it be set it bit with the excellent rhetoric
My vernaculars spectaculous, step to me and I'll settle it
If mastery a language was the goal then I'm ahead of it
You can't connect the checks that I'm cutting down in Connecticut
My flow berserk rib cage gotta soulja's heart
Verbally a double barrel, shotty leave you blown apart
I'm such an animal they kick me off of Noah's Ark
Cause they keep on coming up Shorter than Napoleon Bonaparte
Me? I'm a tall dude never let you fall through
Hard as granite dammit, these bitches softer than dog food
Shoot em up R2 drop so many bars you,
Haters quit your job cause there's nothing to argue;
Now let it

Turn it up let it (bounce)
In the trunk let it (bounce)
Throw em up let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch

This is what we do when
We verbally turn em out
With the speakers to the
Maximum baby just let it
Bounce now

In a crowd let it (bounce)
Turn it loud let it (bounce)
Blow em out let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch

This is what we do when I
Show em what I'm about
With the speakers to the
Maximum baby just let it
Bounce

White boy rap sergeant buzz bigger than Cartman
Mentally a menace my brain's the size of a martian's
Used to be broke as fuck at the mall looking for bargains
Now I got a gold card (cha-ching!) charge em
Started off small now I do it for the masses
Spit it greater incinerate em burn em to ashes
Now these new college kids think that they can match it
bitch I drop classics all you droppin' is classes
Who needs Hofstra? Hip hop's my donna school
Hotter than my mamas macaroni with some gaba gool
Yeah I'm cocky as fuck, just being honest fool
Being modest isn't in a single molecule
In my whole body, who's touching me, nobody
Now I'm up on iTunes taking your money
Give a shit my nose runny cause I spit it so sick
Now bounce turn it up in the whip cause you know we gonna

Turn it up let it (bounce)
In the trunk let it (bounce)
Throw em up let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch

This is what we do when
We verbally turn em out
With the speakers to the
Maximum baby just let it
Bounce now

In a crowd let it (bounce)
Turn it loud let it (bounce)
Blow em out let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch

This is what we do when I
Show em what I'm about
With the speakers to the
Maximum baby just let it
Bounce

I'm that dude with a 40 while everybody sipping Rozay
No filter on my mouth not a thing I won't say
Check the clocks like Coldplay know what time it is
And my future still looking good like Marisa Tomei
Beating me? No way! bitch you better ease up
Who needs a label the only thing I'm signing is a free nut
I'm a beast why would I compete with these chumps
I'm an 8 ball they only equal the key bump
Keep my bars high rap in the car lots
Private school training at the school of hard knots
They pop the hard rock I'm making your jaw drop
So high, I'm up in the sky with Star Fox
Hip hop veteran rockin' with David Letterman
Bad to the bone you can check my damn skeleton
Webby ready as ever you better let me in
Come on bounce let me tell em again so just

Turn it up let it (bounce)
In the trunk let it (bounce)
Throw em up let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch

This is what we do when
We verbally turn em out
With the speakers to the
Maximum baby just let it
Bounce now

In a crowd let it (bounce)
Turn it loud let it (bounce)
Blow em out let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch

This is what we do when I
Show em what I'm about
With the speakers to the
Maximum baby just let it
