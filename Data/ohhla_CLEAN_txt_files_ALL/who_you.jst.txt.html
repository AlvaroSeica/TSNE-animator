Song:   Who You Anthem
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Starr]
My momma never told me it would be, these beats
Seven days a week, no sleep, gotta eat
And make sure I do these songs, hold on
Where the hell did I go wrong, it's all love
I ain't never left the hood black, thug dat
Got to stack, cuz that's where the homes at
Holla back, and Just, see you stand the clubbing
Cuz I know you want this gangsta loving

[Chorus: Starr]
We are due, we are back
We are something you wish you'd have
We will ride and never fall
Who You, we bout to ball
We stand tall, we stand strong
And we will keep going on
Never fail, never lose
When you go against Who You

[Hook 2X: King Just w/ Starr]
Who You... Who You...

[King Just]
Yo, we don't need an invitation, cuz we crash the party
Who You? Meaning you ain't nobody
Had a potty mouth, before I sat on the potty
And I came a long way from slinging cracks in the lobby
Hallway hustling, staircase promotion
Street team gangstas, radio's controlling
Everything we say and play, that's KJ
From around the way, who puff ganja, all day
Exmay, yo ixbay, DJ, put the call in
And tell 'em I need heavy rota'
Okay, I'm reloaded, Ferry boat floated
What I rewrote it, ya'll are deepthroated
Notice, the lack of focuse
You think record sales, make you the dopest?
So boy, you're hopeless and you ain't got shit to show
Not a pot to piss in or a window to throw
It out, no doubt, I tell you one about
And it only take one mic to turn a party out
I'm a giant, you a midget, the first rapper
To ever go platinum with a snippet, it's for real

[Chorus]
