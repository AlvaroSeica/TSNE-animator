Tattoo Ink twenty-fifth, we can't be faded
it's the West Side, where my barrio is located beneno pelon
We can't be faded

[Conejo]
Twelve o'clock mid night, was the time that I roll
One thing on my mind, I wanna to get loko, on the mission
Nobody can't stopped, payback is a bitch
for the vatos that shooting me, and trucha got my partner Pelon
The L.A. calle 25 el barrios mas chignon
challes la juara always wanna fade it
is the West Side where my barrio is located

[Pelon]
Simon yo soy ese pelon, the la calle veinticinco
el barrios mas Chingo, Ese que ay aqui in the wicked part of los
If you don't believe me preguntale I mis enemigo

try to kill the homeboy from the tiny Loco click
sprayed on your bitches, that is the ways is goes they ride

[Conejo]
213 es mi area, my barrio es primero
me feria lo que quiero el pastel lo quiero entero
me entiendes mende te esplico Federico
en la calle soy pelon en la prision yo soy el mismo
o only en la mira once again
I thought you knew
jugando las a todas and you know it is the true
And traigo esta fusca calibe veinty cinco
ya barrios an pedido la vida en este visio

[Veneno]
pay back is a bitch and I know isn't good
and when I die I wanna die in my hood
keep busting clips for the boundries line
Cause when we stared fire
I'm playing flat, mis movimientos esta firme calculados
soy veneno en la vida mal a pagado
total somebody got to die
enemies get shot when the bullets star to flys

[Conejo]
is like I said shout a mouth a snich
all bitches battle and I hold that is your clips
let me tuck you in six feet under
I rather shot the thruder have you ever wonder
when the gang straight we straight like thunder
Conejo is my con rap enemies got to pay
protect body bag put the yellow tape
lock your door this war for the world
quera lo que quieres queras vas in contrar
understad what I'm saying
I si no let's go war, cada regal es muy facil
si le entra all the way
que bradas no ay si la cagas you must pay
el precio es muy caro fools</pre>
