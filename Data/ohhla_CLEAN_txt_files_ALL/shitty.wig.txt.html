Uh-huh, yo, we gon' tell 'em, that's right
You'se a day dream, Maybelline queen, you know the twat team
45 kings in thrones, golden bones
Rock two-tones, got two cell phones
Got a Grey Goose elbow for just twisting the bottle
Holding a pistol, Big Pop, I begs a crystal
Just shitty, writing our darts on toilet tissue
I miss you when you gone, I blow bows of the charm
I'm the, eye of the tiger, ain't easy to remain calm
I slay, competition, I'm here to earn my position
And once I get my title, ya'll fuckas can stop bitching
That's dead ass, I got the streets in the smash
So which, portable rhymes, with mad books in the stash
Fuck class, I'm assed out in a league of my own
My own, shit I ain't know rap was cloned
Bunch of copy cat bitch asses, uh-huh</pre>
