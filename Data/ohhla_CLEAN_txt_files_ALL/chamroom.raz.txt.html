[Sampled Woman] 
Make the bubbles on the glass of champagne 

[Chorus: Baghdad] 
Champagne, follow me 
Set them hot ass hoochies friend 
Bump in here without no beer 
Strip down to ya underwear 
Champagne, how ya wit me 
Party, get lovely 
Pop ya cork, straight support 
Can't woke up, BK, New York 

[Baghdad] 
Fill my cup, we drinks it up 
Chardanay, to the wins, throw it up 
By the fifth-fifties, Porgy picks it up 
Dance nigga didn't rob me up, feel my burner next to my nuts 
How to sneak that in when it was broken 
I told the bouncer it was used for strokin' 
And he let me in, a chug-a-lug thug from Geriga 
Order champagne, can't buy me love 
Just Cali's and the Moet drown in the clutch 
All in the ass like a rubber glove 
Let ya ice wink to the champagne thing, fresh wine
sellers spend much cream 
Let's get this hoochie's staind, and make that coochie thing 

[Chorus: Hell Razah] 
Champagne, by the bar 
Shorties wanna drive my car 
If it's a party up in here 
Shorties shake ya derriere 
Champagne by the sea 
Shorty better follow me 
In the back of the club in the +Champagne Room+ 
Drinkin' up in V.I.P. 

[Hell Razah] 
Let the bottles pop, models watch 
Might get hit in the head wit the top 
That's why I'm hot, that's why you're not 
No hustlin' on my money spot, wreckage movin' by the stock 
Trade my chain for a glock, let me hear them bottles pop 
That Taffy Jay, that Pieron, shorty said "I'm very long" 
Rockin' the red cranberry thong 
Why a G, a GG, that champagne ain't not' to me 
Crush grapes, we ductape, niggas that front wit a thug face 
Niggas don't know how Crystal taste, til they get there money straight 
Move these flows, move these hoes, Moet in the studio 
At the show, get my dough, find me where them groupie go 
Champagne, by the bar, give me head up in the car 
Sean John to Andre, Victoria Secret lingerie 
Shorty so thick I wanna palm her legs, bust my jam like marmalade 
Train tickets I got for days, drink tiggets I got for days 

[Hook 2X: Hell Razah &amp; Baghdad] 
Champagne, follow me, to the bottom of the sea 
While you there, wash ya hair, and ya dirty underwear
