It's showtime!

[Hook]
Everyday, they ask how I'm doin
Deuces up playboy I'm coolin
I'm coolin
I'm coolin coolin, I'm coolin coolin
I'm just coolin
I'm coolin coolin, I'm coolin coolin

Everyday, they ask how I'm feelin
You see the ounces playboy I'm chillin
I'm chillin
I'm chillin chillin, I'm chillin chillin
I'm just chillin
I'm chillin chillin, I'm chillin chillin

[Verse 1 - Swizz Beatz]
I got my Balmain on
Plus my Louis on
I got my Christian on
Boy I get this on
You see me ridin Lotus and my top bitch gone
The interior butter like popcorn
She got on Givenchy, she fresh like me
Everytime she go shoppin Alexander McQueen
I mean, we just coolin on a Sunday
Can't wait to ball out on Monday

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My Jaeger-LeCoultre is out ya culture
The hoods on fire man them boys is vultures
We are family la kostra nostra
Go through up and downs like a roller coaster
Ay! Got my cavi- with them gators on 'em
I'm in the studio fogging with some faders on em
And this beat is my entree
I'm Audi three thousand, Andre

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Eve]
Evey E, I'm back on my bullshit
Came back, came back, back with a full clip
Who want problem, wah- wah- wah-, who want flip
Gun taste, one lick, wanna get some of this
You see that hot pink Birken, that's a problem
I'm hot like everything kickin I'm a problem
Yeah, I'm a walking bow
You might talk a lil one but ya looks are oh

[Hook]

[Outro - Swizz Beatz]
Do ya dance now (4X)
Hit the floor now
Do ya dance now (2X)
Get down now (4X)
Lets work now (4X)</pre>
