[Verse One: Ice-T]
We don't like your kind around here
We don't like those flashy cars
We don't like that hippidy hop
We don't listen to that roll and rock
We just fish and hunt all day
Sleep and drink beer, let me make this clear
If you ain't from these parts don't come around here
If you ain't from these parts, beware and stay clear
Got my shotgun ready, Hound dog and machete
Protecting my still, and I'm moonshine blind
If you die your body won't be that easy to find
To come down to these swamps, you must be out of your mind

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Where I'm from, where I live, where I'll die.. down on the Bayou
Where I'm from, where I live, where I'll die.. down on the Bayou

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
We don't watch your TV shows
We don't listen to your lying news
We think fashion is stupid as shit
I play my Banjo and dance the Jig
Caught my first Gator when I was just a kid
Bit off half my hand and my daddy ate it
Don't wanna ever see the city cause I know I'll hate it
Just some Crawfish and lightening and I'm feeling fine
Don't come around here, boy, stay with your kind
It ain't safe down here and you may not leave here alive
An old pickup truck full of rust
And I ain't paying none of your taxes so don't waste your time

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Where I'm from, where I live, where I'll die.. down on the Bayou
Where I'm from, where I live, where I'll die.. down on the Bayou

[Interlude: Ice-T]
Yeah, I looked at the TV once, stupid!!
Got a chance to look at one of them superstar magazines, they all look stupid!!
I've seen a picture of the city, looked like a bunch of monkeys on top of each other

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I'm eating catfish, Gator drinking, fresh moonshine
Don't come around here, I'll tell you one more time
Don't care about the life you choose
Cause way down here in the Bayou, we got nothing to loose

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Where I'm from, where I live, where I'll die.. down on the Bayou
Where I'm from, where I live, where I'll die.. down on the Bayou
Where I'm from, where I live, where I'll die.. down on the Bayou
Where I'm from, where I live, where I'll die.. down on the Bayou
Where I'm from, where I live, where I'll die.. down on the Bayou
Where I'm from, where I live, where I'll die.. down on the Bayou</pre>
