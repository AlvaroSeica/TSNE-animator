(*talking*)
Steady Mobb'n, Lil' Soldiers (Lil' Soldiers)
And all the juvenile delinquents out there
(wanna get down), locked up
On the streets hustling, ha-ha

[Freequan]
My name Free, you know it ain't no limit to me
See the violence on TV, hurting the seeds
See the guns in they hand, yellow tape at school
Capping slow in the puddles, bringing drugs to the youth
I'm the one who chose to tell the truth, seven years old
My brother nine both of us, trying to grow till we old
Live away from the danger, see the young on the news
Beating down and the fools, mama what I'ma do
Every night, when I lay my head down to rest
I hear the firing and sirens, making a mess
Every cat in the neighborhood, tell me what's good
Never stopping they would, if I could I would a little nigga

[Chorus]
A lil' nigga, (ya heard)
A lil' nigga, (ya heard me)
A lil' nigga, (underdstand)
A lil' nigga

[Billy Bavgate]
A young nigga 15, with a felony I'm churned out
Drinking Hennessy with the family, a young nigga
Smoking my weed, my eyes low
I turned 16, learning how the jail go
My nigga Harley gave me the game, on the coke
My nigga G gave me a gun, now them busters can't roll
17 baby, packing my heat
Motherfucker till I die, I'm representing my street
A lil' nigga, still wishing I was 21
I snuck up in the club, lied about my age trying to fuck 
I was growing up, loaded as a adolescent
Fuck the police, niggaz ain't answering questions
It's the thug in me, I got your girl loving me
Cause I'm a fool, cause she 25 I'm only 17
I'm trying to live a hustler's dream, at a young age
Pimping with my pop's 12 gauge, trying to make the front page

[Chorus]
Lil' nigga, huh brah
Lil' nigga, huh brah
Lil' nigga, huh brah
Lil' nigga

[Ikeim]
Still live in the 'jects, seeing flesh at best
Round the way see the spray, changing life to the death
With my mom everywhere she go, I was on arm
Never scared just aware, one day comes a storm
Can't play in my building, people killing they children
I ain't willing to be chilling, I be wilding and illing
Got a rock in my pocket, and a stick in my hand
I'm just waiting for the boogie man, to try it again
I live in projects, run from bricks no quest
Never did with the trife, when it's bullets to catch
I'm a lil' nigga, so I watch out for my peeps
And they knowing I'm real, they watching out for me a lil' nigga

[Crooked Eye]
I remember cutting class, just to fly to the spot
To watch the thugs and the drug dealers, grind on the block
Infatuated by the money, and the d-boy dreams
Shaking tabs serving fiends, by the age of 15
Living fast growing up, mind stuck on the mail
16 did a bid, for possession to sell
Living life on the edge, gave the ghetto my pledge
Neighbors said by the next year, I'd be shot or be dead
Pack the straps in my draws, no regard for the law
Lifestyle as a lil' thug, rough and raw
Count my figgas on triggas, bucking at older niggaz
Me go out like a punk, how the hell do you figure I'm a...</pre>
