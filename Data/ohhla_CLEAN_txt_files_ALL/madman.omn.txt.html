love is cruel, and all is fair
I stand solitaire, out the corner caught a stare
sometimes I'm too aware
I noticed everything moving, a hand, trigger in my gland
damn, you the bullet, bite the bullet
these are strange times, the same thing that make you laugh make you cry
an eye for an eye, wonder why I still flow
so freely, see me, I'm 3d
keep sticking me with needles, you've never seen evil expressed at this level before
get the fuck on the floor
I'm a loose cannon, I loose screws
and I loose conscious
and black out whole cities, and let loose monsters
put the mittens on you, sick pits on you, new limbs on you
new rims on you
the sickest shit you'd never imagine times ten on you

look into the mind of a madman, too much time on my hands is a bad thing
it's the mind of a madman, overlooked by the mind of a mad man

yo, things you don't do but you've been in rooms of nigga's that do
niggas you look out for but don't presume
cats bout' to go to jail for as many years as you knew him
send some form of loving shit to him
it's a song we can use, to help __ all the wrong
we accuse, its all we ____
its all now or never mind nigga, I forever try to figure out whats the best method
for us to get it
I'm heading in the direction, with fewer footsteps
stumble and stuck, but humble enough
to put reps aside, real enough to let go of the pride
and over shit holding you back from the side
we can kick it nigga, yeah, but we know when to slide
we aint into all that extra, I got connects to the illest __
you aint never heard out do you
that's why the fuck I had to put the word out to you

look into the mind of a madman, too much time on my hands is a bad thing
it's the mind of a madman, overlooked by the mind of a mad man. (x2)

ali baba put the "ab" in ability. ninja mongoose specialize in visability

work hard for record profits
gone till november, broke even in august
still sneak up on your mitsubishi on the low pro
snatch your car logo, ninja star your torso
keep your nympho, study nimpo
essential __ and sold ya info
no mistakes, calculate money well spent
one of those who can stay bent and still make rent
whos the master, whos shoes the fastest
whos group will last, who raised they glass up

look into the mind of a madman, too much time on my hands is a bad thing
it's the mind of a madman, overlooked by the mind of a mad man. (x2)</pre>
