Chorus-
Understand this shit nigga learn about it 
Ay-thing a nigga spit need to know about it
Understand this shit nigga learn about it
Ay-thing a nigga spit nigga know about it
Soak it up boy, ya know, ya know, 
ya know, ya know, ya know

  (E-40)
Smebbin down the street in my 7-0
Bumpin the beat sittin on gold tippity toes
Went to the track to buy me some hemp
Some old nigga yells out "40 you's a pimp"
I said "Playboy understand my strategy
Got to know a little somethin this dope game
fall off into this catergory"
I'm from that real live shit fuck hannabera
I'm from the eighty four eighty fin era

  (B-Legit)
I like to sake Â‘em up rattle
Baby got sattle
If the nigga had a sack could I fuck with that
Got to blowin' up her head with the chitter chatter
I'm out the roof of my coup spittin game at her
I likes to fuck and get up and get on
I'm eatin' steak on the bone
And steady stuffin dick in her dome
I'm on the phone in my hot tube
Gettin' my back rubbed on
About to fall deep in the zone
Let a nigga kick back and put ten to the ceiling
Got my face in the pillow cuz I'm lovin the feelin
Ain't nothin like nuttin' in her jaw
So damn raw, Nipples pokin' out the bra

  (40)
Man in the town I see
Undertakers, Captain Savers, Cape crusaders, A P.H.er
Plays in the game gettin' ratted on
A ba A bitches in the game gettin over on
Never tell a bitch all your buisness
Cuz one day she might be an eye witness
These are the things you need to know man
This shit I'm spittin' 
Niggas don't understand

	Chorus

  (B-legit)
Fools want to come up but ain't paid dues
Want to hang around a player lookin' for clues
Well in my younger days I did dirt
Put in work, I used to but ki's from Kirk
And nigga don't think that I wasn't the man
Out there jiggin doin' all that I can
But now in 95 I done flipped the scrip
Hopin' muthafuckas understand this shit

  (40)
We used to local till we signed with Jive
40 numnum went nation wide
Who would ever thought that Earl,Earl
On the pitchers mound with the curl -Would be
One of the biggest things to that ever came out the V
Since Michael Copper and confunction barely graduatin Hogan High School
Drunken, Hillside representitive, sky unlimited, game's unlimited
Magazine street pioneer Ex D boy ask my cousin Troy

	Chorus

  Man, 40 would you rain on me man, Sprinkle me man
  Hey, would you tie my shoes lace me up or somethin 
  Man I need to be sprinkled man Ay
	Understand this shit, nigga know about it, 
  Know about it
	Kind of like when the drought about to hit you need to know about it
  You gotta done lived this shit to know about it
	Yeah, check game - a fool got at me the other day, Right?
  Rit.
	"Hey, hey B, How y'all niggas be comin with that ol' wild shit?"
  Huh?
	I say check game playboy, I'm from the 84 - eighty fin era
  Eighty fin era
	Where we done did that shit, know about that shit
  Know about that shit
	Spit that shit
  And it don't quit 
	And it won't quit
  And it won't stop
	And it don't stop
  Fuck a hoe
	Fuck a bitch
  Fuck that hoe main!</pre>
