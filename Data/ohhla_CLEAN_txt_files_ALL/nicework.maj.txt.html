Song:   Nice Work if You Can Get It
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Madam Majestic]
Holding hands at midnight...
'Neath the starry skies...
It's nice work, if you can get it...
And you can get it, if you try...
Strolling with the one girl...
Sigh and sigh after sigh...
It's nice work, if you can get it...
And you can get it, if you try...

[Carlos Bess]
Work is frequently looked upon
In the same light as say a compressed oil, energies

[Madam Majestic]
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask anything more?
Loving one who love you
Then taking it that route
Oooh, nice work if you can get it
And you can get it, wont you tell me how?
