[Intro]
Yo C.O. - open this fuckin gate already man!
Yo P (yo) that bitch comin to see you? (You know it!)
Aight man, bring me a loonie back from that there floor man
(I got you, don't worry my dude!)
Pass me some wire too man
(Aight throw me your line nigga, throw me your line)
Aight bet

[Nems]
I spent most of my time conversin with bums
And these cheap-ass toothbrushes is hurtin my gums
Smokin out of the tissue paper hurtin my lungs
It's like you destined to be here when you birthed in the slums
See I was - raised by the gun, fed by the wolves
Rage at an early age, learned to carry them tools
Old timers tried to feed the jewels, but I never listened
Did it my own way, and I ended up in prison
Fuck your life, fuck your laws - nigga fuck the system
Every time I'm on the phone, I hear wifey bitchin
Talk about how I ain't home - and how much she missin
Shit next time, I'ma listen to my intuition
Cause in here, niggaz got helicopters and Bentleys
Oh yeah - then why your commissary empty~? (Why?)
See me lightin up a Bogey and get friendly
They eyes show despise, I ain't surprised that they empty

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Skinnin 'em, beatin 'em, waxin 'em
This is for that minimum, medium, maximum
On the Island, niggaz wildin and shit
Come home catch a new one and do the same shit

[Nems]
You can look into my eyes and realize that I'm gon' be a star
Go to sleep, dream that I'm home, wake up behind bars
Shit! This is my life so far, I live in hell
From your cell to the day room, day room to your cell
Shit - oh well, I guess it can't get worse
Told you I was livin in hell, this can't be earth
'Til the day that I ride in a hearse, I'll rely on me first
Fuck a co-D, I do my own dirt
Put in my own work, and I do it with stealth
Cause you can bet your bottom dollar I ain't tellin on myself
Tell niggaz for they health - stop snitchin, stop lyin
And when you get knocked - stop bitchin, stop cryin
Start cheesin when I hear pigs start fryin
Keep talkin and I'll make your wig start flyin
Fuck rhyme nigga I'm about to spark iron
First day I came up on shot, I hit the block like BLAOW

[Chorus]

[Nems]
I sit alone in my four cornered cell starin at darkness
Listenin to gangsters losin shit
Over here you'll get left blown
Nigga I hope it rains continously 'til the day that I get home
I couldn't give a fuck about it
And these loonies ain't comin in 'til next week
I'll have to do without it
(Yup) Damn~! These showers gettin crowded
Hold my gun under my thumb, come close you gettin outed
I thought the nigga was gangster, but he shouted
like a bitch, now the police got me surrounded
Keep my feet grounded, hand off the ox
My man hand it back to me, on my way to the box
Put me with the big dude, look like he chew rocks
Have to hit him with the soap up in the tube sock
Cause niggaz'll do anything to get what you got
Cause it's either you a bitch nigga or a nigga who rock
Yeah!

[Chorus]</pre>
