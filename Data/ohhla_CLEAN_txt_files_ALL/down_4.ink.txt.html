Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uhh speakers up, loud weed
Rollin in the back seat
Smokin on that loud seed
The clouds in my back seat
I just want that
I just want that
Money like an athlete
Say that I'm the realest nigga
Here if you ask me

[Verse 1]
Uhh, yea I'm on fire
Come and ash me
Just crept in feelin
Greater than your Gatsby
You ain't gotta
You ain't gotta, gas me
High out the galaxy
No gravity
But I can feel her grabbin me
Shawtty wanna little bit
Yeaa uhh take her home
Homicide
Kill that shit temperpidic
I spill that shit still baby
You can feel that shit
Drippin down your legs
I'm about to go in I hope you
Ready for it

[Chorus]
Uhhhh it ain't hard to tell
I gotta question for you
I ain't really in to guessing
So just tell me
What you down for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down for
This ain't nothin new
Baby you should come around more
We could have a good time
Thats what she around for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down
Fooooorrrr, yeaaaahhh
We can get into it

Teller I said turn the speakers up
Now we don't give a fuck
Blunt lit one hit go me on some good shit
Bat tat tat batgang what it is bitch
Four Bs up you can tell'em big business

[Verse 2]
Know we run it like sprints
Bet a hunned that you man he cant do it like this
Bet his wrist aint bluish like crips
Rose, blood gang, take a sip and a Su
Baby I been talking crazy
Looking for some action, less conversation
Acting like you basic
You knew when you wore that I was gonna holla
So baby girl just call back, I need all that now

[Chorus]
Uhhhh it ain't hard to tell
I gotta question for you
I ain't really in to guessing
So just tell me
What you down for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down for
This ain't nothin new
Baby you should come around more
We could have a good time
Thats what she around for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down
Fooooorrrr, yeaaaahhh
We can get into it
Yeah we can get into it [x3]

I said gon get it to it girl
Show me how you do it girl
I said gon get it to it girl
Show me how you do it girl</pre>
