[Ryan Leslie]
You've got fashion and style
I'm lovin' your smile and
The way you get down
I can't see no one else
It's you by yourself, yea
In spite of the crowd
(Baby no one else matters)
It started off with a kiss (uh huh)
Never expectin' this (uh huh)
And now I'm here copin' with
My addiction (addiction)
It started off with a kiss (uh huh)
Never expectin' this (uh huh)
And now I'm here copin' with
My addiction
While all the girls say

[Chorus: Cassie]
I'm addicted to you, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you, you're my addiction
I'm addicted to you, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you, you're my addiction

[Ryan Leslie]
When I'm lookin' in the mirror
Honey, you are all I see
And it could not be no clearer
That I need you here with me
I was hopin you'd notice
The way that I like to
Have you around
Listen and you will find that
Your heart beats for me
Girl, I hear the sound
It started off with a kiss (uh huh)
Never expectin' this (uh huh)
And now I'm here copin' with
My addiction (addiction)
It started off with a kiss (uh huh)
Never expectin' this (uh huh)
And now I'm here copin' with
My addiction
While all the girls say

[Chorus]

[Fes Taylor]
I said baby, I have you strung out
Cuz I shine like the sun when it come out
Yeah, girl, I can give you a fix
Ma, you feeling down, I can give you a lift
Taylor 2 Fly, baby, you my boo, you fly to
We G-5 to, stunting, g-ride to
Stick shift love, baby, you can ride to
I slide through around 7, like your size shoe
Besides you, never met a perfect girl
So I stuck right beside you, in this imperfect world
Bedroom, make you circle and twirl
Backshots keep working it girl, girl, girl, girl

[Chorus]</pre>
