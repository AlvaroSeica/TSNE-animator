[Girls talking]
*honk honk* "Hey, hey what are you doing over there?"
"I..I'm just standin', I.."
"Come here, come here."
"Ok."
"What are you doing?"
"I'm just waitin' for..you know he's..he might come now."
"Left you standin' in the rain all wet."
"Wai..wait, I just wanna say."
"No no, who are you waiting for?"
"A guy I met at the show."
"Who Slug? You're waiting for fucking Slug!"
"No! I mean no, uh yeah."
"Oh no, you're..you're fucking kidding me."
"He's so hot."
*Mixed conversation*
"Fuckin' Slug? Oh my God, he is so fucking ugly."

(Verse 1)
I wear my scars like the rings on a pimp
I live life like the captain of a sinking ship
The one thing that I can guarantee
I'm like a stepping raiser, I suggest you stay fair with me
Been paying dues for a decade plus
Before that I was just another face on the bus
Tappin my foot, to the beat on the radio
Dreaming bout the mic and the money and the ladies,
Oh mom, I promise I'm gonna be large
Some day I'm gonna stop trying to borrow your car
Gonna go far, with charisma and skill
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill
Atmosphere, it's just a ten letter word
Discretion is the name of my cement feathered bird
And if you didn't hear, then fuck whatever's heard
I think you got the sickness, I suggest you get it cured
Caught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix
I'ma hobble down the street till I reach Knob Creek
It's not that I dont like you, I just dont want to speak
You fucking freak, now keep your days out my week
The world keeps a balance, through mathematics
Defined by whatever you've added and subtracted
I'm pushin on the hammer to trigger the brain
Embrace how I live, cause God loves ugly

(Hook)
God Loves Ugly.. God Loves Ugly.. (echos)

(Verse 2)
Once upon a time in Minneapolis, yo
I damn near had to steal the show
I stepped on the stage, who is it?
My name's Slug, I've come to kill a couple minutes
And what's up with the way that everybody gathers around
Each other, so they can steal each other's sound
If it's all about getting down, when they get down
How long I gotta wait for these fools to sit down?
Appears more clear in it's simplest form
Nobody sees tears when you're standin' in the storm
Abandonin' the norm, and handlin' the harvest
Measurin the worth by the depth of the hardship
I welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name
I held onto the sacred ways of how to play the game
When the soldiers started runnin short on rations
I began tappin' the egg to spark the hatchin'
Make it happen, and take this captain to the gallows
I keep steering us into an area that's shallow
Talking to my shadow, he advised me not to worry
Said, I should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury
So give me some light, a little love and some liquid,
I'ma creep through the night and put a plug in the spigot
And when the water grows, and the dam starts to overflow
I'll float on top the flood holdin' on to my ugly

(Hook)
God Loves Ugly.. God Loves Ugly.. (echos)

(Verse 3)
Why scream, when you can lose yourself inside the widescreen?
Let life be a bowl of melted ice cream
Or be the deer that's caught in my high beams
I'm rolling with the brights on,
Scared stiff, reality is just too much to bear with
Paranoid, walking around, careless,
No wonder your in love your therapist
Go to sleep my little time bomb

(Hook)
God Loves Ugly.. God Loves Ugly.. (echos)</pre>
