[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
First nigga tough... gettin' trunk
I got that 30 in my pocket... wassup
300 swoll in the club... get stunk
A couple shots gettin' fired, we ain't lettin' up
Don't nan nigga, want war with us
Don't nan nigga, want war with us
Don't nan nigga, want war with us
A couple shots gettin' fired, we ain't letting up

[Fredo Santana]
A couple shots gettin' fired, we ain't letting up
Grab a choppa, grab a tech, grab erythang
Kill erythang. Own erythang
Yeah them 30s and them Glocks, yeah we tote those
Fufu ass niggas, we expose those
Call my little niggas up about a stang tho
Sit down, plot about it, then we take it down
Anybody move... or make sound
Couple bodies drop... from them choppa rounds
Everyday is Halloween, I got my mask out
All my niggas savages don't make a spazz out
Tadoe on it and he got the fuckin' 40 on 'em
If a nigga want beef I send my shorties on em
Yeah that life bitch... I'm a bout that
Catch a nigga snoozing... push his cap back
Yeah that life bitch... I'm a bout that

[Chorus]
First nigga tough... gettin' trunk
I got that 30 in my pocket... wassup
300 swoll in the club... get stunk
A couple shots gettin' fired, we ain't lettin' up
Don't nan nigga, want war with us
Don't nan nigga, want war with us
Don't nan nigga, want war with us
A couple shots gettin' fired, we ain't letting up

[Sd]
I'm a monster we be takin' shit (yahh)
We gorilla ass niggas don't want war with us (nah)
A lot fans don't need a guard (uhuh)
And I got a lot a niggas fuck a entourage (yahh)
High as fuck I'm koolin with the stars (chillin)
Chillin' with them bennys bitch I'm close to mars (gone)
We sac'd up then he get robbed (wahhh)
I'm a flashy ass nigga I don't need a job (nahh)
Couple racks on ya head nigga (yahh)
Keep that tucked and you would be a dead nigga (bwahh)
You want war at yah back yard (rahh)
Them niggas stupid just tryin' on camouflage (jay-z)
I'm addicted to the kush nigga (loud)
I'm a drug addict pill poppin' hood nigga (let's get it)
Too much money for a war with us (yahh)
GBE bitch it's only us (3hunna)

[Gino Marley]
Group a wild niggas blood hound niggas
When it comes to stains we take down niggas
Kis and pounds nigga hit the ground nigga
Let 30 shots go call that shit a crowd clearer
Lotsa loud innas foreign cars in 'em
We sum bread winnas so we some band spendas
Open all doors bitch let the squad enter
And we share hoes bitch let the squad enter
Money over all no ops in this mob nigga
Put money on yo squad that's a group a dead niggas
And all we do is win ain't lose innas
And we stay turnt up we ain't no kool niggas
Keep the tool and we move never snooze nigga
Couple shots to ya body try to move nigga
Time is money and we owe money all the time
War is nuttin nigga we can war at any time</pre>
