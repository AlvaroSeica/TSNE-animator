[Remedy]
It was a dream, I used to read Source magazine
Cool J, DMC up in the limousines
Hanging pictures on my wall, BDP
Rakim, Juice Crew, the Golden Era had it all
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smoking on skunk weed, drinking forty's on the block
Way back, when I had the '93 blue four-runner macked, pockets always stacked
'Member Sugar Hill Gang, Rapper's Delight
Who ever thought that hip hop would survive overnight?
Nobody, waited til the time's right, cuz my rhymes is tight
Time to do me, blow up like the economy
Born winner, the opposite of a sinner
Still do rough, to eat tuna fish for dinner
Peace to Red Alert, Marley Marl and Stretch
Funkmaster Flex, we've been blessed
I got money like I knew I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know</pre>
