[Intro: Styles P] (Statik Selektah)
Statik whattup?! Ghost! D-Block (Statik Selektah!)

[Verse One: Styles P]
Stone cold shooter, let the heater blow
Gun that a just main Twitter, follow the leader though
Up in the hood, homie askin I got my nina on
Adjusted his eyes on some niggas that he needed gone
It's like that regular life ain't normal
If you die to shine the ice ain't for you
If the sky fall then the skype can't warn you
Like when you hear it crack the dice don't warn you
Lightin up weed, pour that sour
In the streets in the mix like Kool Aid powder
Ride on them niggas show 'em you ain't coward
Yeah you got family but you ain't ours
Get popped up, oxed up or boxed up
Thins it's a joke then bitch nigga then hop up
'Cause I'm Ghost and I'm still O.G.
This time I'm with Statik and the trill O.G. 
Whattup?!

[Chorus: Statik Selektah Scratchin]
L-L-Livin rich or livin poor-f-f-funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"
T-T-This not the season can't stop the heathen-"Jadakiss"
Funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"
A-Al-All the All the g's is gettin money, and relaxin-"Jadakiss"
T-T-The funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"
A-A-And I don't even care about the charges if they ain't federal-"Jadakiss"
Funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"

[Verse Two: Bun B]
I walk the cold streets of the city with big heaters
Ready for cats there's no one up they dick beaters
Yeah it's big B the trill O.G. walkin
So keep your mouth shut when the OG talkin
If I want your opinion then nigga I'll beat it out of you
I'm bred for the gutters bitch I'm doin what I gotta do
And that's got alot to do with where I was raised
Original land of the trill where they roamin with k's
On the ground with the gauge and they lurkin with ninas
Doin dirt to get paid committin more than misdemeanors
What's the wildest shit you seen a nigga do in his life?
Is the average shit, that's goin on here every night
And you can go to P.A. to the beam out in Yonkers
The young niggas wildin in the streets goin bonkers
Best thing I could do right now is pray for you
I pass Pineiro the pistol nigga to lay on you, hold up

[Chorus: Statik Selektah Scratchin]
L-L-Livin rich or livin poor-f-f-funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"
T-T-This not the season can't stop the heathen-"Jadakiss"
Funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"
A-Al-All the All the g's is gettin money, and relaxin-"Jadakiss"
T-T-The funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"
A-A-And I don't even care about the charges if they ain't federal-"Jadakiss"
Funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"

[Verse Three: Hit-Boy]
For every nigga that say he proud of me, it's a nigga out for me
Feelin like Martin Luther I'm standin out on the balcony
Niggas used to be close but I cut 'em off call 'em amputees
Niggas was in the van with me, only niggas advance with me
Bitches ain't wanna fuck now they on they knees for a chance with me
If you knew what that bass meant this is my fuckin rhapsody
Feel like I'm on +Rap City+ killin it with my faculty
High off the ground I swear I'm defyin gravity
An IE youngin but when I grow up I'm a buy me somethin
I always knew it like the psyche bluffin
Miss Cleo of the hustle I swear I could see the future
We got bigger guns than dreams little niggas'll shoot ya
For no reason other than colors he looked up to his brother
Now we layin beside him too many tears for a mother
Too many story of hunger but fuck your informercial
I be out here in the streets tryin to teach my niggas to come up
Word!

[Chorus: Statik Selektah Scratchin]
L-L-Livin rich or livin poor-f-f-funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"
T-T-This not the season can't stop the heathen-"Jadakiss"
Funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"
A-Al-All the All the g's is gettin money, and relaxin-"Jadakiss"
T-T-The funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"
A-A-And I don't even care about the charges if they ain't federal-"Jadakiss"
Funerals stay on schedule-"Jadakiss"</pre>
