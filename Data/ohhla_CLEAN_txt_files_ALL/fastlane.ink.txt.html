Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I know you see me ridin high
Feels like a roller coaster headed to the sky
We rollin' speedin'
Like we runin out of time
And live the fast life
You could get behind [x2]

We in the fast lane
And all I see is dolla signs
Cause all I got is money on my mind, right
(We in the fast lane)
Swerving in between the lines
(You see em' hatin tell him get behind)

Might find me posted on the scene
Roll up
burning to the 3rd degree
That O G
You could throw away the leaves
I go in like you could throw away the key
I got the world awatin me
Cuz bitch I'm hot come get a sun stroke
if I say it please don't unquote
Got there hands up like a dumb pope
They ring girls just like the front post
Put a ransom on the beat
I need that money you want that
Beat
Alumni army you best retreat
As fly as I can fuckin be
I know you see me ridin high
Eyes low and I don't think that I can drive
We still up it's bout a quarter after 5
live like we wont see the afterlife
i know you see me flyin by

you see me ridin high
feel like a roller coaster headed to the sky
we rollin' speedin like we're runnin outta time
and live the fast life
you could get behind [x2]

We in the fast lane
And all I see is dolla signs
Cause all I got is money on my mind right
(We in the fast lane)
Swerving in between the lines
(You see em hatin' tell him get behind)

Ya
We never slowin up, ridin round top down
so you know its us
cant notice much
cause I'm movin at the speed of light
bad bitch wit me she ain't gotta be polite
long as she with me tonight
we can get it poppin like I'm orville redenbacher faded of that juice and vodka
if you tryin to get intoxicated
holla at me baby, get you anythin you need
it's a hit and run watch me crash the party then I leave
like vamanos tell them bitches adios
sick I need a higher dose
fast life die slow
on a rollercoast headed to the top
now put your hands in the air cause baby
its about to drop

I know you see me ridin high
Feels like a roller coaster headed to the sky
We rollin' speedin'
Like we runin out of time
And live the fast life
You could get behind [x2]

We in the fast lane
And all I see is dolla signs
Cause all I got is money on my mind, right
(We in the fast lane)
Swerving in between the lines
(You see em' hatin tell em get behind)</pre>
