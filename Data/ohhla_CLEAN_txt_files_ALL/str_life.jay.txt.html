[ CHORUS ]
Can't get enough of that street life
(Get enough)
Get enough of that street life
(Of that street life)
Can't get enough of that street life

[ VERSE 1: Kool Rock Jay ]
A brother on the corner, sellin crack
If he had a job it wouldn't be like that
But then again - black, what about the mail
Hah, that he's makin, he ain't fakin
His mind's in neutral and his body's revvin
What car today, the five-o or the Legend?
And what shoes to wear and what jacket
Everyday thoughts in the cocaine racket
Oops - almost forgot the best
Rather have dents than a hole in the chest
Now peep game as the game unfolds
Cause now he got a mansion and a brand new Rolls
Life goes on and the show don't stop
Shootin up blocks and payin off cops
So next time you better think twice
Because it's hard in that street life

[ CHORUS 2x ]

[ VERSE 2: Kool Rock Jay ]
Young lady, 'bout to have a baby
Mama playin the background drivin her crazy
She's uptight, she's upset, with nowhere to go
Who's the father of the baby? She don't know
Now wake up and smell the orange juice
Because you know you shouldn'ta been so loose
Because your boyfriend broke, left you in the smoke
Played you like a pooh-put, you'se a joke
Got half your check everytime you got one
You'se a sucker and the boy can spot one
Nine months ago you was thick and on hit
But your braincells wasn't workin for sh-
Now you're played out, because you shouldn'ta stayed out
With Tom, Dick and Harry you laid out
So next time you better think twice
Because it's hard in that street life

[ CHORUS 2x ]

[ VERSE 3: Kool Rock Jay ]
You and your crew, out on a mission
You trigger finger's about to start itchin
You see a brother on the corner
Full of that 8Ball, now he's a goner
And yeah, you start cappin
You hit him in the chest with the blast of a Mac-10
Murder One's the name and doin time's the game
Now tell me who's to blame?
You - ain't nobody else
Brother, you pulled the trigger all by yourself
Actin like you're cool, so what you wanna do?
Take it like a man or put the blame on your crew
You know the deal - you better chill
Close your mouth 'fore your cap gets peeled
And next time you better think twice
Because it's hard in that street life

[ CHORUS until end ]</pre>
