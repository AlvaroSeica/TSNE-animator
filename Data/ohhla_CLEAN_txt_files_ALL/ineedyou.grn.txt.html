I Need You Tonight

[Professor Green]
This ain't so stereotypical man
Not for a stereotypical man
It should be me that wants to get rid of you
Instead it's you that don't give a damn (what?)
It was meant to be a one night ting
Nothing more than a little one night fling
Now when I'm in need you're the one I ring (I need you tonight)
But she's playing hard to get
A brunette with such class
She's hard to forget
See at first I wasn't after her heart
But I couldn't stop thinking about her after I left
I'm beginning to lose my cool
It appears in love I have fallen (whoops!)
I'm ready to put my all in
And all she does is ignore my calls!

CHORUS [Ed Drewett]:
She's everything I want, but all that I don't need
How can she be so hot, yet be so cold to me?
How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right?
I wish I never, but I need you tonight!

[Professor Green]
This lady's driving me crazy
She blows hot and cold like the A.C.
I just can't figure her out
Next time I'm with her I'm pinning her down (Oi)
I'm gonna' find out if she's on it or not (not, not)
Cause all of this shit is long (long, long)
See I front like I'm okay but I'm not
I'm being played at my own game and it's long (long blud)
I ain't no eedjit
I'm pro, I'm no intermediate
So next time she 'phones me
I ain't even gonna pick up the phone to speak, init?
[Telephone rings]
Nope, swear down,
[Telephone rings]
Wait a minute, that's her now..

[Green] Hello?
[Girl]  I really wanna' see you today
[Green] Alright, just give me a time and a place and I'm there

CHORUS [Ed Drewett]:
She's everything I want, but all that I don't need
How can she be so hot, yet be so cold to me?
How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right?
I wish I never, but I need you tonight!

I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I want you
Won't stop until I've got you
There's nothing that I won't do
I need you tonight

[Professor Green]
Look
I ain't never been the type to be this (no) 
I ain't never been the type to be with
she's exposin' a side of me that, I'm tryna' fight, I'm tryna' hide
My pride, I'm tryna' find it
But ain't seen it
I'm an eedjit
I know I can't help it I'm fiending!
(I need you tonight)

OUTRO CHORUS [Ed Drewett] (Professor Green in brackets):
She's everything I want, but all that I don't need
(I am...)
How can she be so hot, yet be so cold to me?
(...in a bad place) 
How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right?
(This stuff don't happen to me, I'm me!)
I wish I never, but I need you tonight!
(Swear down, It's just a song, in real life) 
I need you, I need you
(This would never happen to me, I am a pimp) 
I need you, I need you
Won't stop until I've got you
(women chase me, I do not chase women, swear down)
I need you, I need you tonight
(Swear down)</pre>
