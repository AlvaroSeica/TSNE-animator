oh nooo, no uunh nahhh
fatlip, chali 2na
ah ha ha ha
yeahhhhhh

[Fatlip]
I paid my dues
refuse to lose
so fuck the blues
and ya bad news
you can trip if you choose
while I sip booze
on a seven day cruise
in louis vuitton shoes
with floozies by the dudes

the good life
talkin' bout the good life
live it up for a little while
then go to the hood
to get a good wife
and settle down
but for now
I'm studyin' Tao
refuse to allow
myself to defile
like when I was sniffin' piles

still got trials and tribulations
refinement from cultivation takes patience,
I'm waitin'
paper chasin' to get a place like Payton
politickin', interfacin', business relations
build a empire from the underground, then retire
who said I was on crack?
you's a mothafuckin' liar!

see me in the trenchcoat, but missed the joke
so fuck the hopes, my mission is this:
get in position to assist my folks
huh?
get in position to assist my motha, m-my motha, and my auntie, and my  
uncle, my folks, you know?

unh

today's your day baby, whachagonedu?
(4x)

[Chali 2na]
I know, what do I know?
lurkin' five-oh, puffin' dro
tryin' to dive slow, wicked fly flow

intimate verses that hit surface with quick service
but never nervous in this big circus
a quick purchase
of green foliage, and clean bowl hits
redeems focus when it seems hopeless
supreme dopeness
on plain paper for you plan rapers
this landscaper's scrapers abrasive as sandpaper
don't try to fan vapors, you caught this onslaught
reforms start for those who perform be pure slop
for sure shot I'll handcuff a
word muffler heard 'nuff of the bullshit
you nerds suck up out the back gate
lyrics so pregnant we lactate
get your facts straight, we stack papes and crack plates
over wax snakes who pack hate
they lack faith
while 2na and fatlip put you in a relaxed state like

today's your day baby, whachagonedu?
(4x)

[Fatlip]
what I'm gon' do?
you know, get me a six
and fresh kicks, pickin up chicks
when I'm up in the mix
can't predict my art shoulda hit the top of the charts
but my heart's in the right place
nice headspace
slow paced from the buddha, but not the bass
not a moment to waste
thirty three
no degree or g.e.d.
my mind's free, i learn without bein' taught
I see how the battle's fought
it's opposite of how I thought
I woke up,
opened my eyes up, wised up
rised up to the game, time to change my name
Edy Crahp
comin' with different shit, Edy Crahp
write it down niggas, hear the reverse significance?

It's terrific when I'm on top of my game
specifically speaking, the way I be freakin' my slang
give me the mumu, the poopoo, and the mic and i'm creased
fat lip, squeaky clean, don't stop, don't cease.

today's your day baby, whachagonedu?
(8x)
