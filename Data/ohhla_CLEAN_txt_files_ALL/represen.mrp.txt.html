[Master P *talking*]

[Master P]
Represent yo hood, boy, tell me where you from (oh ooh)

Represent yo hood, boy, tell me where you from (oh ooh)
We got this bitch crunked and we gon tear the club up

She don't give a fuck, we gon tear the club up
say - I don't give a fuck nigga, they don't give a fuck nigga
We don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up

[Master P]
I was born to be a hustler, they labeled me a dealer
Say I grew up to be a killer, like my daddy Percy Miller
Me and Cleo smoking weed, say the whole family cursed me
C-Murder innocent, (ughh) but these niggas wanna see him hurt
So fuck y'all Crease, he just wanna be famous
He mad 'cause he dough and we some rich entertainers
So represent yo hood, we back on the grind
We gon get this bitch crunked like it's 1999
So holla at me, whody, he's the one who b's
Trow ya middlefingers up to the ponk police
Than pass me the gumble, (oh ooh) We gon get it to the flo
I ain't Lil Jon but I make them hoes +Get Low+
And make them thugs say fuck y'all, ain't we gon touch y'all
I'm just a predator that straight gon cut y'all
Grab it - than take me to the booth
tell the DJ to play this 'cause he fucking with my lout


[Chorus]
Man - I don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
We don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
They don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up
Say - I don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
We don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
They don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up

Fake niggas (buck em up)
Fake hoes (buck em up)
No Limit in this bitch (ughh) and we gone tear the club up
Fake niggas (buck em up)
Fake hoes (buck em up)
No Limit in this bitch (ughh) and we gone tear the club up

[Master P]
So duck down, nigga, y'all ready be ready
Me and Silkk come to this bitch, like Jason and Freddy
Look at what y'all did, I was trying to be good
Y'all made me leave the hills and come back to the woods
I'ma blaze like Derreck Anderson, turn green like a hawk
Wild out in the club and make a nigga pop that crunk
I'm a No Limit Soldier, the party is in the crew
They may take my gold tooth but they can't fuck with my tattoos
I got a good heart, some bad friends, thats why we grap ten
But a nigga ain't scared to die, do life in the pen
Real niggas don't change when they hit the fucking block
Nigga, free C-Murder, come back so I got ya
I'ma ride with my niggas, I'ma die with my niggas
I ain't roll I light em, so I'ma get high with my niggas
And my cousin came home from jail, man, that boy say he changed
He a motherfucking liar, heard he rollin with the Feds

[Chorus]
Man - I don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
We don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
They don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up
Say - I don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
We don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
They don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up

Fake niggas (buck em up)
Fake hoes (buck em up)
No Limit in this bitch (ughh) and we gone tear the club up
Fake niggas (buck em up)
Fake hoes (buck em up)
No Limit in this bitch and we gone tear the club up

[Silkk]
Say you, whody, naw nigga I ain't talk on rap
Bring it to ya crip, let him live let him talk about that
I'd rather turn my back on em, than get the gat for em
I got the game all twisted, nigga, lets twist it back for ya
They label me a gangsta, thats how I was, thats how I will be
And it's simple, I can't let no bitch nigga kill me
For real, P - Fo real we
Live a hell of a life-style but we still creep
Got a couple niggas go, but we still deep
Now I got a movie for y'all niggas, who like to act
I'm great with my hands, I'm like Roy Jones with a gat
I'm real a - great hussler, I'm a hyke with rap
(Master P: Nigga, we going triple platinum) Treu, I'ma aight with that
Been in the east and the west, laid back with the players
(...) and P.Miller jump off all type of flavours
You know - yeah, I turn my back to them haters
I got a lot to say to them fake pigeons, but I get back to em later
Now I just - gotta be real with it, left the project but I still visit
Fuck rappers that wanna fuck with my cousin, he still can get it
So don't make me have to touch you - cut your five fingers off
Four I gotta keep the middle, now tell em "fuck you"
And scream (oh ooh) if you know you the hardest
If I ain't the one fighting, I'm just trying to get the fight started

[Chorus]
Man - I don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
We don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
They don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up
Say - I don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
We don't give a fuck (oh ooh)
They don't give a fuck and we gon tear the club up

Fake niggas (buck em up)
Fake hoes (buck em up)
No Limit in this bitch and we gone tear the club up
Fake niggas (buck em up)
Fake hoes (buck em up)
No Limit in this bitch and we gone tear the club up</pre>
