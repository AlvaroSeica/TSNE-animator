[Chorus]
Ohh yeah do it pa'
Ohh yeah do it pa'
Ohh yeah do it pa'
Do it daddy do it

Ohh yeah do it pa'
Ohh yeah do it pa'
Ohh yeah do it pa'
Do it daddy do it

[Verse 1]
I give it to her hard so she know who I be
Instantly she fell and gave it to me
She wanted me since the first time she saw me
She felt me and it turned out she liked me
I remember when I first saw her
I chased her and inside I caught her (yeahÂ…like that)
Ma you're the one for me (ohhhhh)
If you only imagine the stuff that I told her
Night fell and she called me to come see her
I got anxious ready to go beat that
But she had to be mines for me to get that
Everyday for me to solve all her problems
She gets freaky on the phone when she calls me
She's a freak too when I have her in the bed
She's hood she's far from a dame
Bad friend and sex full of drama

[Chorus]
Ohh yeah do it pa'
Ohh yeah do it pa'
Ohh yeah do it pa'
Do it daddy do it (*repeat 2X*)

[Verse 2]
Without pity I give it to her so she remembers
She sees nothing most things she misses
Ma' sucks on me and even bites me
Doesn't from shorty's the truth
I saw her when she came through the door
From what I see shes a lucky pussy to me
It's better to be alive than dead in the bedroom
I wanna see you wrapped up ma'
Baby come here hold on to me
Grind slow and move it to the side a little
Pirate come hard, I give it to you hard but mellow
Before I leave I give it to you girl like
Take it, take it make the bounce like rubber

[Chorus]</pre>
