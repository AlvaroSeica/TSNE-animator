[Madd Kapp]
This for the kids
All the kids around the world that ain't got nuttin
That got limited resources, limited education
Limited everything! Sleepin on the ground in huts
Y'knahmsayin, sleepin in alleyways
Wonderin why the world don't want 'em

My prayers go to the kids, I see the hurt and the pain
We spend billions on the war but poverty remains
And with poverty comes crime, the ball and the chain
It's trickle down economics, only governments gain
We'd rather spend on warfare, machine guns and ammo
Flyin stealth bomb missions, bombin people on camels
While the poor people fight over the simplest shit
It makes my heart hurt; pieces in this puzzle don't fit
And when I watch TV and flies are swarmin on kids
over in Africa, tell me what the fuck they did~!
It only cost two dollars for a bag of some rice
But I guess that's just too much to pay for a life
You fuckin bastards, bleed us all dry 'til we die
We just numbers on a paper, bodies covered with lies
So while you're sittin in your comfortable office, think about 'em
Millions of people, buried shallow in fuckin coffins

[Chorus]
Why do you stand by and watch the children cry?
Can't you see the pain inside their eyes
All they really want is a fightin chance
Livin life as a victim or circumstance
Goin to bed hungry without no food
or the proper education to make it through
Not everybody in the world is as lucky as you
I think it's time to make a change man, how 'bout you

[Madd Kapp]
Mr. President, let's have a debate, let's talk
about the homeless situation in America boss
You're a smart guy ain't you? Let me paint you a picture
Families sleepin in cars in Congress is no issue
I watch C-SPAN, the newslady looks so pretty
But the news never is, overseas it's shitty
Troops dyin~! American troops, the bravest of brave
Who follow they orders, in the name of freedom of faith
Look at this place, it's lookin similar to hell
The devil is here, I can't feel him can't you tell?
He's the government, settin us up and lovin it
Laughin out loud at us, peace he's sellin it
(I see you) I see you too motherfucker
(Join me!) Not on your life you dick sucker
I'm free, free as a bird, I got my wings
God bless us, shelter our souls and make change
