Song:   Livin it Up
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

They say that Ima dreamer, I ain't the only one
Just everybody else is locked up or on the run
On the heroin the cocaine or the rum. Tryin to cope through the madness and growin numb
In a 9 to 5 trying to make another dime. Too stressed out to read in between the lines
Flipsyde magnifies lies 9 times. And if you still can't see then yo ass blind
They say a little love, is all we really need. But its hard watching little kids shoot and bleed
And Martin Luther King said love your enemies. But love seems to be the last thing they're giving me
So all you need is us. And all we need is you
Let's make the world over. Just how we wanted to
And it'll be what we dream so let's dream big
The futures right now. The times starts here

WE LIVIN' IT UP TODAY. YEAH, DON'T BRING US DOWN. WE GOT TODAY, TO BRING THOSE GOOD TIMES BACK AROUND
FEEL THOSE GOOD WINDS BLOW. AWAY, AWAY. FEEL THOSE GOOD WINDS BLOW. AWAY, AWAY. FEEL THOSE GOOD WINDS BLOW

Can you see my future? Tell me Gypsy woman what does it say?
Is it love? Maybe more? I don't care I'll just let it go
And it comes and it goes and it leaves but we know, say we know we gotta keep on trying
And we fall and we rise with a strength in our eyes cause its the only way to keep on flying

Fly away, I'm gone start that fire
Just blow away. I'm gone start that fire right now

WE LIVIN' IT UP TODAY. YEAH, DON'T BRING US DOWN
WE GOT TODAY, TO BRING THOSE GOOD TIMES BACK AROUND
FEEL THOSE GOOD WINDS BLOW. AWAY, AWAY
FEEL THOSE GOOD WINDS BLOW. AWAY, AWAY
FEEL THOSE GOOD WINDS BLOW</pre>
