Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Frank Ocean]
A tornado flew around my room, before you came
Excuse, the mess it made, it u-sually doesn't rain
in Southern California much, like Arizona
My eyes don't, shed, tears, but boy, they pour when

[Chorus 1]
I'm thinking 'bout you (ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinking 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus 2]
Or do you not think so far, ahead?
Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, oooh
Or do you not think so far, ahead?
Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, oooh

The remix
Beautiful black woman can you accept me?
I'm hoping you never forget me
Touch you wrong I never let my hands let me
Feelings for you as deep as my ancestry
Lookin at you, black as an Egyptian statue
Elegant in stature, got'cha
All in my mental, when I feel the energy
Every memory I still try to capture, rapture
Beautiful goddess but modest and I'm as astonished
as everybody else that I let you escape my physical
Form and to be especially cause you were warm
I was hopin that we would make a commitment that was biblical
Pivotal situation put us in critical consequences
I feel like it was all senseless
Now my pain, when I be feelin when I'm defenseless
Cause I shoulda worked harder for you up in the trenches
I'ma be +Frank+, +Oceans+ I think about it
Comparison when I measurin the depth of our love
There'll be nothin above; sadder than +Purple Rain+
Memories got me +Cryin+ like a +Dove+
Well do you ever think about it - or did you really forget?
I don't think I forgot an hour
What you used to look like steppin out the shower
Super sexy put you in a position of power
Spiritual essence of what a real woman is
Let's get in a time machine, I call it music
Hoping I can jog every memory and get subliminal
takin you back forever the way I use it
How I tell the DJ spin it
Thoughts about you are usually in-finite
You on my mind is always authentic
When I think about you I be all up in it

[Chorus 2]

[Frank Ocean]
No I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in I-daho, since you think
I don't love you, I just thought you were cute - that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Frank Ocean]
Yes of course; I remember how could I forget - how you feel?
You know you were my first time - a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black &amp; white

[Chorus 2]</pre>
