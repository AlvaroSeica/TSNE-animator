Typed by: Tha Masta

[Chorus: chopped and screwed w/ porno sample in the background]
Make that pussy pop
Make that pussy, make that pussy, make that pussy pop
Make that pussy, make that pussy, make that pussy pop
Make that pussy, make that pussy, make that pussy pop

[La the Darkman]
These fassy-ass hoes, slidin' down the poles
When the booty club shake, you tryin' to make a bankroll
Magic City in Atlanta or Sue's in New York
Girls take their clothes off like strippin' is a sport
We should give 'em an award for the world's best dancer
Any man'll wanna touch it if they get the chance to
The badunkadunk fat, she know how to make it clap
Droppin' ones and invisionin' hittin' it from the back
And her head like crack, boy, you become addicted
Body like a Goddess, but her mind's so wicked
I choose to stick it, some choose to lick it
Make that money girl so you don't get evicted
Pop that pussy...

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
Yeah, I had girls of all kinds, never tried to make 'em mine
She got 20/20 vision, nigga, I'll fuck her blind
Wishin' I could press rewind, look how she moved that ass
First she started off slow, then she'd break it down fast
Tryin' to get that cash, mama I respect ya hustle
Some Fendi or some Gucci, flex that coochie like a muscle
Absolut or Grey Goose, help that pussy get loose
Couple cups of Petron, baby, have ya mind gone
You ain't gotta leave alone, I got homies, I got Goose
We could take it where you wanna, to the house or to the roof
Private parties what I'm gettin', blowin' haze, Henny sippin'
Watchin' bad broads strippin', I'm a playa, I ain't trippin'
Pop that pussy...

[Chorus]

[Outro: La the Darkman]
It's that nigga La, you know?
Let's ride 'em slow, you know?
It ain't nothin'</pre>
