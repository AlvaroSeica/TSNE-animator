[Rome 1]
Man I pull up to the lot with my system crankin
Niggas posted up just smoking and drinkin
Ghetto queens wearing Apple Bottom jeans
Some of the phat asses that I ever seen
She working with a machine
Shawty got a whole team pulling up in a hummer limousine
Nichole, LaShawn, Aisha, Keisha, Refeka, Precious nice to meet cha
Your body's stupid in LD's classin
Its fly and its night time and you wearing sunglasses
Now let me see your eyes girl
Damn they hazel
Now lets take a ride girl
Tell your homies well be right back
Damn you just wanna up and leave like dat?
I just wanna get to know ma
I got a few things I wanna show ya ma
In my car

[Chorus]
In my car
Don't look to hard cause my jewels might blind you girl (hmm hmm mmm)
Kick back I'm caressing on your thighs, that's right
In my car
Its so many things I wanna do to you (hmm hmm mmm)
Stop fronting you kno you want me too
Ya know ya do
In my car

[Rome 2]
We can hug, we can kiss, we can touch, or crush
Forget about the club
I hope you not in a rush
You make a nigga wanna sing R &amp; B again
Telling me how you was an IMx fan
Your body language is hypnotizing
Jeans so tight, how you get those thighs in?
Ankle bracelet and you got your tongue pierced
You got a sexy voice
Damn you so fierce
Your heads stroking my leather interior
On the real, I'd love to be into ya
I mean literally
Cause visually
You killin them B
And I know you feeling me
Work a blind man fingers to brail
Whatever goes down between us I wont tell
It'll be our little secret
On the low we can get on some freak shit
In my car

[Chorus]
In my car
Don't look to hard cause my jewels might blind you girl (hmm hmm mmm)
Kick back I'm caressing on your thighs
In my car
Its so many things I wanna do to you (hmm hmm mmm)
Stop fronting you kno you want me too
Ya know ya do
In my car</pre>
