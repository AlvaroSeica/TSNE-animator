Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, woaaahhh

[Bootleg]
I'm a drug dealer, killing in my neighborhood to be faded
Feds they want Bootleg permanently in carcere waiting
But I'll never let them see me sweating my techs striking a pose
Hanging out the cuddy, nutty, nigga busting at hoes
I robed a little, rigged a little, stole a little I admit it
But I bet one witness won't come forth and ever say I did it
Cause those the snitches sleep in ditches, ya'll I know the story
I refuse to have the F.B.I. and police searching for me
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, woaaahhh
Was a renegade when I was younger but I've never been afraid
To jump out windows and bust at hoots whenever them bitches raid
I'm tooting cane, catching trains, loving illegal inhaling
And I keep a case out my head for Feds that's on some bailing
Have you ever heard of a murder beiing commited with a house of plants
I must do smart to ever get cought, know my forensic science
My daddy never loved before he left me and my momma
Clio the Psychic told me: Fuck him, he's drowning in this crime
I wait to see a shrink, I think I'm dealing with some plants
Gave me some pills, said "keep it real", medicate your brain
I live my life just like a fragile, time is out to rock
So everytime I cock I'm screaming "Fuck Cops!" and hit your block
Fuck the F.B.I., I rather die before the Feds catch me
36 hundred murders before them bitches can scratch me
Hollow Green still fucking with my teenies where we balling
Tommy loving Steve Pitts for all the shots that he calling
Fuck the F.B.I.!

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, woaaahhh
Yeahhh, these ain't the Feds you knooow
They'll take your life and gooo
They'll set you up for suuure
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, woaaahhh

[Shoestring]
(beat stops)
Niggaz are sucking my dick for taste
Licking my nuts all over the place
All in my face, when stealing my base
We're talking about my homies case
Dayton is on the rise again
What's taking them up is bringing them down
Fucking them up and shooting them up
Fuck you hoes we run this town
(beat starts)
Shoe' is about they're cheese and cash
Boot' is about they'll kill your ass
Niggaz was running their mouth too fast
Too damn quick and they got blast
All you hoes can suck my dick
Fucking your street and fucking your clique
Y'all can't fuck with Dayton (echoes)
God know you're feeling like me nigga
Hear my shit and bite me nigga
You don't want to fight me nigga
Sucking my dick so write me nigga
Don't you want to kill yourself
Fucking around with T.D.F.
The media till your shit was death
And left your tape up on the shelf
Fuck the Feds, kill they're boys
Dealer Hoes ain't make no noise
Snipering in their backyards
We're Eli's they're Big McCoys
Once again, you know what's on
I got something that'll get you gone
Shots blew out his dome
reported missing, cause he wasn't home
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, woaaahhh
Rob and Shoe and L.F.A.
Bootzilla and Jake The Flake
Dirty bird is back again
He go too down inserting his 10
Leave the streets no alibi
Back was blowing helly tire
Wanted by the F.B.I.
Walk your town and they could die
Motherfuck the Federalis
Hung their ass like killer Kelly's
If you're their son, then you're a bitch
Hold out, just like your daddy
Walk straight up and bust your head
Blast your ass and then I fleed
Took you out with nothing said
Only because your ass was dead
Fuck the Feds!

[Chorus x2]</pre>
