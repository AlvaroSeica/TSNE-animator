[Greg Nice]
A freak freak and you don't stop stop
Ah-yo a freak freak and you don't stop stop stop
A freak freak and you don't ah quit quit quit
A freak freak and you don't quit quit quit

[Chorus: Greg Nice - 2X]
I know you wanna jeal' but we still wreck shop
Damn right we gon' sell, sell a whole lot
WHY?  Because the Nice &amp; Smooth shit is hot
WHY?  Because the Nice &amp; Smooth shit is hot

[Greg Nice]
Aiyyo run Harry run quick to the dance floor
I freak it from the Boogie-oogie to Ecuador
You never heard me freak a beat like this before
You wanna hear more then come catch the tour
I met mad cutiepies at the Jersey shore
You say piso, I say floor
How soon we forget the man with the hooks
Greg N-I, I make 'em dig in they pocketbooks
Things ain't always the way that it looks
No morals in the game they be bitin like crooks
They be bitin like crooks, they be bitin like crooks
They be bitin like crooks, they be bitin like crooks

[Chorus]

[Smooth B]
Check it, I'm royalty like Lawrence, of Arabia
My third eye visualize like Professor Xavier
The rap savior, and woman pleaser, no teaser
I move through Harlem like Black Caesar, no time for a seizure
Pity for fools who didn't catch my family jewels
Since life is school time for me to change up all the rules
Islamic moor, I write a rhyme and lift the poor
Bite the hand that feed you now you get nothin, while I soar
Jealousy will get you nowhere fast, you can't last
Like a rich trick, payin for ass, I keep shit flowin
Your mind I'm blowin, cash I'm stowin, without you knowin
While I +Russell+ up dough like +Lyor Cohen+

[Chorus]</pre>
