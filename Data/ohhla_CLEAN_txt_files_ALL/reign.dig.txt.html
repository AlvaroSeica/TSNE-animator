Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
This the type of joint to make my stock rise
The type of joint you gotta turn the volume clockwise
Here it from down the block, haters turn the counter clock
House party girls dancing on the counter top

The young boss so do as he say
And I'm only 16 yeah dieciseis ha
Lifes a beach and I'm playing in her sandbox
I'm a lover not a fighter but my man box

Time flies and I've never been afraid of heights
Only beef I've ever had was with a plate of rice
It cause to warn you niggas can't pay the price
So I ain't gotta say it let alone, sing it twice

Right.. Ha.. Yeah!

[Chorus]
Gonna be a long ride, before I touch the ground
They've been waiting for a long time, But I ain't falling down

[Verse 2]
Uh, they've said I swerved in the fast lane
And I'm only on cause my last name
Can't chose your family, but you can choose your friends
I got my own money now so help me choose a Benz, Beamer

A Porsche now a none are left
I'm known to the full so I'm kind of like whateve
Whateve, yeah you know how I do
Unexpected Arrival now I'm a idol's idol

If kings are born then I'm coming for my title
If kings are born then I'm coming for my title
If you ain't get that then light one and sit back
I'm out of here bitch I see you wanna get back

D. I. G. and its

[Chorus]
Gonna be a long ride, before I touch the ground
They've been waiting for a long time, But I ain't falling down

[Verse 3]
I guess this is the time for me to give thanks
So everybody that who participated in all the ranks
Starting with God let me make that apparent
And of course I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my parents

P. Boyd and Sean Garrett, Far laid and Atlantic
Paul Bulk and the Jones Girls forgiving the clearance
Now that that matter is all settled
Its back to the rhymes like breaks down to the medal

Black everything, except for the kicks
If the bottoms ain't red its J its the sixs
Can you stand the reign New Edition posts Bobby
Know ya'll thinking "Damn this little man so cocky"

I'm just me though.. I'm thankful.. U. A!

[Chorus]
Gonna be a long ride, before I touch the ground
They've been waiting for a long time, But I ain't falling down

Ohhhhh.. yeah</pre>
