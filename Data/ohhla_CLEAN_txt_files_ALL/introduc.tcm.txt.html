Introducin'
The Lord Jesus The Christ
The Author and Finisher of All Life
 
We brings the ruckus when we uplift the gift of salvation
It was He who came through forty-two generations
Logos invasion  
to planet Earth through virgin birth
the last Adam had come to reverse
the works of the first
He became a curse to become a cure
the blood poured made sure
that he who enters by the door 路 will be eternally secured
What shall I render?
surrendered lives are due to Him
in due time the True Vine reconciled humans
to the divine union of the Father
Hearts are altered to the altar
He died for all walks of life  
He's the Lord of all cultures
Perfector, Resurrector, all life is His 
Sin-disconnector, Eternal-holder of the sceptor of righteousness
Thunderous praise comes from his numberless 
fleet the sovereign King
all things are placed under His feet
The uncreated, incarnated creator of all creation
is to be celebrated in all occasions 
'cause He's the glorious, victorious Victor
with the greatest victory of all history
peep the unveiling mystery
of the Chief Corner-stoner, the atoner
we present to this world the most generous Blood donor 
 
[Chorus]
 
Unto us a child was born, a son was given
to be given into the hands of wicked man
and like a lamb to his shearers
the Sin-bearer was terribly beaten, spit upon
crowned with thorns scorned by the heathen 
still breathen?
They stripped him Cat-of-nine whipped Him
What sin have they found in Him?
for four-hundred Roman soldiers to be poundin' Him 
surroundin' Him with mockery
Them not havin' eyes to see
He fulfilled every prophecy 
to the lower case "T" 
at the cross the cost was paid 
a door was made no more barricade
between God and man 
Peace was made by the blood of the Lamb
that was shedded 路 I've been reconnected
to the Creator who is the Resurrected
Savior, who is the only accepted Mediator
unlike those that claim to be
The fact still remains to be
the Son of God broke my chains and bore pain for me
'cause when no one else did, He died
so I can live, so it's not I that lives
but Christ that lives within my quarters 
worthy is the captain of the bloodsport
whose blood bought us 
His love caught us
when we were in sin at every hand
He broke heavy bands
when he took a taste test of death for every man
Come and see we've found the One 
He's the bright and Morning Star 
'cause everything revolves around the Son 
He's omnipotent, omniscient
self-sufficient, pre-eminent
co-existent, never distant
the divine Thriller, the Blood-Spiller 
Void-Filler 路 the Peace-be-Stiller 
the Sin-in-the-flesh-Killer
The livin' agua 路the never endin' saga 
Aleph and the Tau, Eternal Father 
Infinite with all might whose shinin' bright 
with all light Jesus the Christ 
the Author and Finisher of all life!
