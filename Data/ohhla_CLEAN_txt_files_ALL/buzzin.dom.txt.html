[Domo Genesis]
Niggaz wishin I'd fail
They got a better chance with quarters in wishin wells
Brains refused them but still wishing them well
Elevated thoughts, but you can see from the smells
Fast living and ash flickin
Parties with bad women fashion and, big cash spendin
I'm passin them, car with no gas in it
Bitches fall in love overnight they passionate, pass the shit
Nothing but big kush joints
Love me cause I'm Rose Bushing, lyrics got a good point
Rap it how I live it, live it how I'm rappin
Promised last year I'd dent it, now it's cracking
Makin shit happen, lil' nigga, big dreams
Take the game double player like I got split screens
Smoke big trees, and count big cheese
Hands to the hairline, salute the whole team, yeah

[Tyler, the Creator]
Told y'all niggaz y'all wasn't ready, nigga
Domo Genesis is killin all you niggaz
Niggaz "Rolling Papers" in this motherfucker
Smokin weed, fuckin bitches, and eatin cereal nigga
Domo, hit these niggaz off real quick
Yeah

[Domo Genesis]
Cause swag sales we are born rich
Hit 'em in they head with shots, cum like porn flick
Horse flick like boards went, liquors get portioned
Louis Vuitton checkers printed, on some board shit
Cords get plugged in in a rush, no endorphins
Blazin 'til it's done, when it's done, bring some more in
Steady gettin blown, bitches know mighty comb
Light skin, long hair, bored then abort them
Sicker than St. Jude's, chemo get spit at
Got good ways with cuss words and syntax
Big stack, shitted on, no elax
Thirst-ass bitches want watered down, so relapse
This where your bitches'll be at
Hand on hairline, make sure them niggaz see that
This where your bitches be at
Hand on hairlines, make sure them niggaz see that

[Tyler, the Creator]
Niggaz ain't fuckin ready, nigga!
Told y'all niggaz "Rolling Papers" coming in this motherfucker, nigga
Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All
Don't give a fuck, nigga
Now roll that joint up
Smoking good with this shit right here nigga, yeah
We ain't fuckin playing with these niggaz man
You think we fuckin playin, nigga? Fuck that</pre>
