"Death is silent - painless.
 I didn't know what happened.
 I was suddenly standing above my body.
 while you looked on, too much in shock for tears.
 I tried to speak... but couldn't.
 I tried to talk to you... but you wouldn't listen."

[Kno]
Yo, death is silent
It hides high in the night's confinement
Vile and violent, minding a time to try us
And remind us that we cry when time is denied us
To incite this, fear of death inside us
Death is spineless
It will find men that you confide in and confine them in asylum
Make those that you dine with and reside with
the, same lives that you will pine for in silence
Death is mindless
Nevermind the genotype or phylum
It's designed to find and defile us
From afar, Senegal to Riker's Island
Death's not confined to latitude, lines, or mileage
Death is timeless
There's no sense to fight with the violent nihilist
Binding the eyes of the lifeless
But such that life is aligned with, death's assignment
Don't let it define you, you define it

"Everything that we know... is forever dead
All the things in the world we love have gone away"

"Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
 Lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter"
