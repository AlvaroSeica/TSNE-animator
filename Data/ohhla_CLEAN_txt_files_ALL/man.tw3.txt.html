Get that motherfucka, get that motherfucka get him
Get that motherfucka, get that motherfucka get him
Get that motherfucka, get that motherfucka get him
Get that motherfucka, get that motherfucka, get his busta ass get him
Dump him in my trunk, drag him to the river
Dump him in my trunk, drag him to the river
Dump him in my trunk, drag him to the river
Dump him in my trunk, drag him to the river

[Tommy Wright III]
Wakin' up early in the mornin', straight up joanin'
Gotta get full ah them drugs, leavin' them nigga wid slugs
Couple ah Memphis two faced nigga that thug
It ain't no love, I told you before,
So lemon ass niggas get filled up wid lead
Get caught by surprise, come duck and be tried
They instantly die, bullet one to the head,
Blood gotta shed when I load up my rifle
a sniper deliverin' lead to your dome,
Shot been inflicted wid doses of pimpin'
I hang in South Memphis but hell is my home
Home wid them killas my nigga cap peelers
gravediggas remember my temper is short,
Snortin' cocaine, it's fuckin' up my brain
My mind is maintained by devious thoughts,
Keepin' a weapon of any ill threat
that's for suckas who stampin' and pluggin' that hole
My roadie be killin' cap peelin', dog dealin',
two villain, no feelin' for snitches who nosey,
Givin' out clout to them clock of a dolla straight bought 'em
I saw them wid triggas I sawed 'em,
No mercy for niggas I'm out to make figgas
I'm leavin' 'em in rivers so bodies gettin' hotter,
I thought of a plan, to murder a man,
and get away clean wid the money and dope
The tradegy I will leave will be like fatally
tied the two to the tree put 'em up in my smoke
Full ah that fuckin' blow, rippin' a forty-four
Chief as I cough and throw up on them mega blunts
Niggas who flodgin' get broke when I'm robbin'
So suckas start dodgin' or get put up in my trunk

[Project Pimp]
Pistol grip forty-four in my hand, ten wanted men got a masta plan
Chasin' that bitch till he run outta breath,
Bullets don't stop he gon' meet his damn death,
Put him in a ditch, deep in the ground,
Burnin' the mug, you got some gas,
Smackin' him with that forty-four bitch
Finger on trigger keep tellin' me blast
Nuthin' but this thang, everyday thang,
Killin' niggas, doggin' hoes
Ten wanted men once again wid a bang
Project Pimp I'm shootin' them tones
Hangin' out at the door wid the dope forty-four pistol
and vamp wid the gin on the seat and I'm pullin' the triggers
that leave his ass cuz, Project Pimp ah psycho thug

[T-Dawg]
Man T-Dawg in the joint once again
for the nine-six Street Smart bumpin' that shit,
Leavin' these niggas fucked up, whopped up wid that thirty R six bitch
Cappin' and snatchin' these killas drug dealers cap peelers
We out for your gravy hoe,
Ten wanted men on a mission wid murder shit
That bitch got your classy hoe,
Creepin' slow, on the floor, on a hoe
lookin' for the trick, wid the riches up in this thang
Strapped like Jack wid a click in my back
in the getaway van, ready to blast
Body bags, on the ground, I'm leavin' these niggas for them folks
Man T-Dawg I'm outty five but another nigga classy clothes

Hook

[Tini]
Creepin' to the scene in a glimpse, never seen,
Disappear, like a ghost in the wind it's me
T to the I to the N to the I to the M-A-I-N-E, Tini
Pockets feelin' broke so I gotta make a stang
On a lemon man that's got me fucked up the game
Comin' from the dark so I bust your heart
wid the seven Jason masks gimme all the cash hit the gas,
Smack and kick your bitch up the side her head then cuff her
time to gag her wid the Tommy Hilfiger that I snatched up off yo bitch,
Tie your hands behind your back,
Get the oxy vogues from the window out the 'Lac,
Chiefin' on another sac I got another plan,
Hit the stach pot cheese and dope,
His bow was in the blow, we left him on the floor,
Smack him one more time before we go,
Hopped into the Chevy thang let me throw up again,
As the green, let me think, Tini five, no I strive
How that like that ain't no way that ain't no good
But I can't afford to make no losses Jason mask ain't this a bitch,
Millimetre jealous so they scopin' me, bloody glock is in my hand
Perry Ellis smellin' like a lucci, quarter ounce a dope is in the air
brothers can't stand the truth playa robbers creepin' from the east 
prepared,
Glock seventeen lookin' mean, as release, cock it back
Spin rounds over the side to the ground,
Did ya, did ya get him?, yes I got him,
As I tired ah bustin' scatter creep ya knees to the back sippin' Crown
Thinkin' of a scheme it's a dream it's for real lay him dead
Mr. Tini maine ya shouldn'ta crossed me out
Forty-five Gs, six kill a pound a weed, two other trees
Manslaughter, Tini five I'm in the house
