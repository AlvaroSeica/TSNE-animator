[Sean Price]
This is for everybody 

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Listen, everybody love a star
Every chick want a nigga fresh dip, but pushing a car
Everybody want to fight the power, light the powder
Sean Price for president, Eisenhower
Everybody want to rap the best, scrap the best
Clap the sketch, Steven Segal snap your neck
Everybody know Jesus black
Everybody know the trigger finger is used to squeeze the gat
Everybody know gas is high, pass the la
Stash the crack when the cops come passing by
Everybody want to act so cool, like a jazz musician
Grow cancer from a pack of Kools
Everybody want to sign to Koch, seven dollars a record
Stop lying, you ain't getting that guap
Everybody want a beat from Black, and a verse from Guilt
Everybody hating, wanting me killed, P

[Black Milk]
There's nobody

[Verse 2: Black Milk]
Nobody want to be at the bottom
Broke barely making it, niggas not making no dollars
So you want to be on top of
The world watching a ho topless on top of your (uh, uh)
Niggas wanna be the tough guy and hold steel
Cause nobody wants to be weak and show fear
That's why most niggas get killed, but
Nobody wants to feel the bullet when the guns spill (uh)
Feel them handcuffs, get put away for months
But, that's what nobody wants (uh)
Being done in the pen, right to the end
But nobody wants to see life come to an end (nah)
Nobody wants to see their time gone and
Nobody likes when their high's blown (uh)
No hoes, no riches, don't have no shine
Nobody want to be that guy, no

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Somebody needs to take the blame
These dudes throwing rent money up just to make it rain (clowns)
Fronting for a broad that don't even care about them
She don't even love herself, she fuck for wealth
Looking for a man she feels is somebody
So she can feel that she's somebody
Braindead, but give great head
With a sassy mouth, at the club whole ass is out
Somebody's going holler, pay to fuck, probably
I won't lie, the chick got some body
Nice ass and tits, she got one hobby, money
Catch her in the hotel lobby
Looking for somebody, to spend cash
Big ass finds out where the bricks stashed
You'll need at least one shotty
It'll be a John Doe when they find some body</pre>
