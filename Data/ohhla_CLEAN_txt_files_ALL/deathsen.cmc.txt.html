I was taught, never put trust in a young man
cause if you let him live then he'll try to take a stand
take command of the whole show
but no it's not so, so I put him on deathrow
I crucify my flesh daily
cause if I don't then my flesh'll try to slay me
a try to slay me kill the wrong guy
wack ships so mud, objection is murder (?)
on the third degree, and thats the word for me
I pull the plug on his cardiac emergency
you might think it's ill G
but if I don't kill my flesh then my flesh'll try to kill me
so I just kill and kill and kill and kill again
no mercy put my flesh in the herse it's not my friend
so if you want to lock me up I'm guilty as I present this
It's an everyday death sentence

[Gizmo]
murder one in the morning when I wake up shake up
I pray to break up any plan the devil will make up
I bails at the flesh cause see the noose is fixed
Christ is alive and my flesh is on a crucifix
but the flesh is like a Terminator, why?
I kill him once but he comes back like Arnold Schwartzeneggar
like when I thought he was back in the dust
he tried to stab me in the back with a knife full of lust
so I let 2 fly
First Corinthians 6:18', Proverb 5 and 5''
this time I'm makin sure I take him out
as he bails to the ground I grab my sword and gouge his eyes out
pull out his tongue with James 3 verse 1'''
every chapter every verse
back in the hearse it go
if it rise up to sin I'm gone do it again and again and again
cause it's an everyday death sentence

everyday, everyday, everyday death sentence
everyday, everyday, everyday death sentence

[Daddy Free]
my spirit man is alive
and for my spirit to live flesh has to die
cause it'll be a straight conflict
my spirit wants to do right, my flesh wants to trip out, and get out
the grave that I paved and buried him in
quick fast in a hurry to sin you see, my flesh is in the clique
he's cornered on and hes tied up in sin devil wickedness
like lust, fornication that results in the jealousy
sorcery, idolatry, immorality
fighting, backbiting, being mean
like Galations 5:19''''
and it's in, the wages of sin, equals death
so I really have no other choice left
I denied him, crucifed him, blind side him
tied him up and choked him up I snuffed him
plea for mercy, I continued to hit him
till I destroyed his deeds and everything that came with 'em
the next day he tried to make me sin, but no win
cause I'm gone pray to kill him again
went on a fast, no juice no bread
gillotene to the head, ten seconds before he's dead
dont trip up, I'm not a menace
this ain't a one time thing it's an everyday death sentence

[Gizmo]
in jail, for murder one homocide
you killed somebody no I killed my pride
cause thats when the flesh homies
you tried to make me feel like I'm the one and only like Sony
yeah years did the finest on my ego
yeah boy you've been dope since your fetal stages
why don't you write pages and pages of dope rhymes
and bust lyrics like gauges, rock stages
he tried to make me arrogant like some of y'all
but it's a set up, cause pride come before the fall
It's a struggle, so Giz ain't givin in
I'm dealing Monday and Tuesday but still he want to live again
cry from flesh so it want recognition
so I beat him down in humble submission
I grab pride by the neck I and slung him
before the Cross of Calvary I grabbed the rope and hung him
Christ is only lifted up, so I don't resent this event, or repent
this is an everyday death sentence
oh God I got a life time bid
I confess I killed the flesh and oh yes I'm glad I did
now I'm D E A D, and it's he who lives in me
and guilty is how I plea
and it's a everyday death sentence

everyday, everyday, everyday death sentence
everyday, everyday, everyday death sentence</pre>
