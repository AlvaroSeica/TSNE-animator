[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
In my time machine, yeah I ride clean
Marinate the scene with my high beams
Candy-coated dreams whenever I lean
Take me forward far, this ain't just a car
This my time machine (take me way back, way back)
This my time machine (take me way back, way, way back)
This my time machine (take me way back, way back)
Take me forward far, this ain't just a car
This my time machine

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Take me way back, Scarface in our tape deck
Riding with my poppa, rocking a starter and some gray sweats
Gave me game as we rolled down 8th street
Niggas out there flexing, don't be stressing what you can't be
and don't be vouching, don't believe in what you can't see
unless it's God, and don't be borrowing cause ain't shit free
You got your family and your friends when you need relief
There'll come a time when I can't be there when you need me
He leant my seat back (way, way back)
When it come to music, yeah you need that (way, way back)
Forever in the cut where you be at (way, way back)
Forgive and forget, your anger, leave that (way, way back)
Don't be wasting time cause time is all you have
Don't be chasing hoes, boy go chase this cash
I can't say no mo', you'll learn it on your own
I couldn't understand it then, but you know that I'm grown

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Take me way back, fitted with a wave cap
Brushing in the hallway, tryna keep these waves flat
Broads come and go, rarely would they fuck with me
My brother was a player, I was favored off of many streets
Learning rules, paying dues, made myself a name
Laughing at these caped crusader saviors cause them niggas lame
Handcuffing, claim they loving on a freaky dame
But she a bopper, I got partners that done ran a train
We play the game (way, way back)
Even as a youngster, knew I'd be a King (way, way back)
Told them non-believers I would never change (way, way back)
Mississippi where I'm from and that's the shit I claim (way, way back)
It's funny how they flock when they heard you got that knot
Wouldn't bust it open now they dying to set it out
Dying to hit my couch, get off in they mind
like I'ma fall in love, take 'em back in time

[Chorus]

[Chamillionaire]
Uh, uh, hold up, I just wanna say what's up, to the women they discuss
Ain't no rust, you can never say it's lust, this the only dame I trust
Ain't it plush, you can see the painted struts, got the naked lady just
painted up, this ain't no Mercedes cause, bet it make your baby blush
Coats of candy got 'em saying I'm delicious
Every woman on her knees that's looking up is not religious
And I feel like Master P had me not taking minor digits
If you ain't about this life, then close your pipe and mind your bidness
Screw taught us stay authentic and they gon' love your jams
Watts told us gotta keep on mashing and we gon' run the land
J. Prince and Drake were the reasons you had to become a fan
And the only way we ain't gon' win is when we under-plan
Throw a prayer up for Japan, I swear the daily news be having me tripping
Everybody that got a cross hanging off they neck is not a Christian
When the police pull you over they'll say you fit the description
Bun B that's our O.G., R.I.P. Pimp C, feel like I'm with him
when I'm in my time machine
