[BA]
AK's, Tec 9's, Mac 11's, 40 Cal's
Got beef you can drop in it
Funk all day and night wit it
County lock up cell fight's ill put a knife in it
Can't stop I ain't right wit it
Can they throw the 'zine shots and the price on that man fitted
It's a long walk in San Quentin
In the Chev six shocka
Wit knock in the back of it
Walnut and I'm a factor bitch
Throw yo hood in the air if yo block got crack in it
Cutthoatish I ain't got no feelin's
Heart colder than the first day of December
Makin' 'em wimper
Breakin' a hutch
On her heals cuz my hands still shaped like cups
From dawn to dusk, dusk to dawn
Shootin' craps, smokin' weed like Cheech and Chong

[Chorus: Keak Da Sneak]
Sebrany, Walnut, 98th, Brookfield
800 block, 70's, Seminary to the Ville
Habeas Court, Dirty 30's, Murder Dubs, Foothill
McArthur, Bancroft, E-1-4, the Hills
How you like this town shit? [Now where my niggaz on the block?]
How you like this town shit? [Where my bitches on the track?]
How you like this town shit? [We gon' bring this town shit back]
How you like this town shit? [Now where my niggaz on the block?]
How you like this town shit? [Where my bitches on the track?]
How you like this town shit? [We gon' bring this town shit back]

[Keak Da Sneak]
Came from Favor Street hit well
Cuz Big Hugh and Wendell got the purp-el
Bitch in the car thick from Stockton
I told her Turn the party out
Cuz me no cock blockin'
Beat knockin' got my weed in seven tre
Make the right on Bancroft
The town crank everyday	
I'm in the east ridin' and smokin'
I'm my scraper makin' paper
There's no place like Oakland
Just livin' in the city is a serious task
So I gas, break, dip and gas [eeeeeeeer]
We like to swing 'em in the land of the sideshow
Work and pistol in the car we don't ride slow
We take the po-po on one
Get away, hit the studio, another song done
Don't stop man just don't quit
I write my verses in the bathroom so I know they the shit

[Chorus]

[BA]
I'm in that glass house candy green	
Zabco knockin' my 4 15's
Blowin' on trees, strickin' a Pablo
Wit H-O-E's man I don't wife 'em
I smoke light wit 'em
Remy in my cup
Off a half a pill thizzin' man I ain't drunk
What she feedin' that rump shaker? [excuse me miss]
Just some ham, hogs, pork chops, rice, and grits
And your lips poke out just right for dick
Wit your legs open lookin' like TV antennas
G-strings in her, Capri's cut low
Tattoo's on the titties man you ain't knowin'
Where they at in Oakland?
Doin' it live
Castlemont, Skyline, Freemont High
Mack house, Tech doin' the big 'ol high
East Bay stunnas man we ain't hidin'

[Chorus]

WE GON' BRING THIS TOWN SHIT BACK!!! [echoes off]</pre>
