[Chorus]
Escuchame...

It's like a long walk to China trying to reach these heads
See, the world around your body makes your brain stay dead
Stand around in thick traffic just inhaling some lead
I'm in the phone box breathing off some stranger's breath
No change left, I fed my last gold Queen's head
"Busy now" is all the message said, let me leave you
Let your brain cook, mobile  you're agile
Still hearing cancer rays until you're off-the-hook
My mindset stays steady, taking shelter in a hut
On a mountainside, ready for the wind and the ruck
I see a storm blow past with economic avalanche
Because the rich, fat nations try to cling to every branch
Me, I'm playing mind chess then Monopoly with stress
Flipping cards by the log fire with thoughts of death
Got a year's supply of Bics, hiding out in Deep Six
I'll emerge in twenty years when there's no cash left
But for now I'm back to basics, spilling out raps
Freestyling in the snow while I'm laying squirrel traps
It's survival; really none of us can pull it off
Just filling up the silence with my fresh air cough
See, I got theory off but now I'm losing my mind
The poisons in my blood are trying to make it to the outside
Outside  money and cars and more waste, detox
I'm displaced, fighting craving for that city taste

[Chorus]
Escuchame... "Survival got me bugging"  Inspectah Deck [x4]

And like I said I'm all in it like on live through life
Paranoia strikes, creeping out the forest at night
I like to sit back holed up, sharpen my knife
Learning all about myself but I'm missing the hype
It's survival; the helicopter left me with a rifle
But it rusted up so I'm onto snow and berry trifles
I sing aloud in my hideout cause no one can hear me
And nature's looking bigger and it doesn't fear me
Or any of my city ways, haven't said a word for one month
Hear my snow boots crunch through the wasteland
This could be a parallel to cityscapes
Where tree towers overpower and isolate many souls
Nature's like a friend until she turns cold
Those icy looks are icebergs on my tent pole
The IMAX is now live from the arctic
You can call me Braintax, now my verbal film's starting:
Reindeer, a target on the hill by the tree line
I move quick, this reminds me of the free line
Live simple, hunt-and-gather rules still apply
But we never turn to greed and death's a catalyst to life
CAN YOU HEAR ME?!

"Survival got me bugging"  Inspectah Deck

[Chorus]
Escuchame...
