Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Fozzey]
Uh I don't wanna pretend that I'm something else
I just hope that you listen or someone helps
There where days where I contemplated suicide
So I do this shit just to get me by
I don't mean to make out that my head is big
But you gotta understand that I'm still a kid
It's tough cause I'm growin up infront of all of you
And I'm bound to experience a fall or two
But that's life yeah I accept that
Tryna please everyone I regret that
I dunno why but I take it personally
The one person I should worry about on earth is me
With my girl they say I got a ball and chain
But besides her it seems like they're all the same
And the ones before her you're all to blame
Forget the player
Forget the game

[Chorus: VanC]
I'm stuck in this I can't turn back I see myself and I'm stairing back
It's like the whole worlds moving and I'm standing still
But life goes on yeah
I know it will
I know it will
I know it will

[Verse 2: Fozzey]
But it goes without saying this is what I am
And I couldn't care less if you're not a fan
This is all I've got that's what you need to see
No backup job or uni degree
Where this trains gonna stop well it's hard to say
I'm just showing you me and my scars today
Cause they make up most of my memories
If I die tomorrow would you remember me
Them underground cats hate cause I'm mainstream
C'mon man we're only chasing the same dream
I'm not tryna fit in or try and stand out
I'm just tryna accomplish every goal I planned out
Either respect that or try and move along
Cause a goal I had in mind was to prove you wrong
That was bottled up that's what use to rest in me
Now I can go a free soul and rest in peace

[Chorus: VanC]
I'm stuck in this I can't turn back I see myself and I'm stairing back
It's like the whole worlds moving and I'm standing still
But life goes on yeah
I know it will
I know it will
I know it will

[Verse 3: VanC]
Yeah I love the fans man every single one of you
Cause when it all falls I know I can come to you
You showed me love yeah I know I can make it through
That's why my first four lines are me thanking you
I'm still chasing this dream I haven't woke up yet
I'm 19 and I already wanna take it back
Disappointment to my parents cause I quit uni
But they don't understand music means more to me
The way I treat girls I should be ashamed
Waking up in the morning I don't remember names
Yeah I should really be sorry
Cause they all took the time just to get to know me
It's been a while since I've ever truly felt love
But I met this girl and it's close enough
And I already messed it up
I guess it's hard being me but I'm manning up</pre>
