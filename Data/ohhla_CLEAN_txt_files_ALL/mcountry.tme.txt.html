This is a fantastic country with Bruce Lee punching cops
The president is great, he doesn't want me to get blown up
he wants my homeland safe
he doesn't want scientists playing God
He wants there to be enough oil to keep our country running
He's so nice he even wants to lower my taxes
There's no conspiracies or secret plots, just the truth
He wants to eliminate, bad people, bad people, evil
The media doesn't even tell lies here
There's no wars only disagreements
Soldiers are suppose to get shot it
It's just a video game
I feel so safe here I don't even need the second amendment
ah amen
