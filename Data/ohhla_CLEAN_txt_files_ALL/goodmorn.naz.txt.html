[Intro: Bronze Nazareth]
Yeah... you know..
Aight... yo..
Knowimsayin, let me walk through the yards... yo.

[Bronze Nazareth]
Let me walk you through the yards where life is truly hard
On the pathway, from a disease that ashtray
All day, we on the grind like Monday
Just let me smoke my insence, life is intense
Like the Black Day in July..
Excuse me, mam, I'm just try'nna get by
Just try'nna get past these souls that fly
Like the bullets down my way, hoes around my way
Souls is drowing in the dead sea of sex and Alize
Look out for the dead children, maybe you'll find hope
Sitting in the building, around a plate of that coke
Damage your mammo-grammy, we see what's in your heart
On the road to nowhere, the boulevard; Rosa Parks
Those are sharks, wake up, cause the jakes up
Just try'nna reach for his goal, he reach for his gun
It ain't no Tums when the heart burns like the sun
Tears for the whine, sims, this can't be life
Flowers for sale, half off the funeral price
Rock skip accross lungs, family are stunned
Good morning, the flute plays my song of sorrow
Today we got hope, but what about tomorrow?
Good afternoon, still blast the same tune
Good evening, thief Steve was his demon

[Chorus 2X: Bronze Nazareth]
He came screaming, like "Blaow! Nigga fuck ya life"
Good night, sometimes hell seems kinda nice
She came tears, screaming, like why they take his life?
Kissed his forehead in the coffin, good night

[Bronze Nazareth]
Float through the day, like heroin in the veins
Of a mad sinner, from whiskey to a bad liver
It's mad different, when he trying on my shoes
Maybe they learn in turn, that I don't wanna breathe booze
And they don't wanna sell birds, bricks &amp; bodily germs
Just try'nna reach our goals, so we reach for what burns
And I probably know I'm wrong, but it's the same old song
On the radio playlist, how the sales made him famous
And you probably wouldn't see us, just as niggaz &amp; felons
Maybe you'll find promise in a box of ego talents
Maybe you'll see dreams in the eyes of the fiends
And the tray green for green, is the best way, it seems
Now we ain't say we innocent, angels, or preacher's sons
But you slap my hand away whenever I reach for funds
Anger and pain, take a bang of the George brain
On the train to nothingness, with wilther mere dreams
It ain't no time, when freedom is on the clock
You'll either join your sports team or I'll bench press a glock
Good morning, I guess we never broke the slavery bonds
Cause I came out the precint with the same chains on
Good afternoon, I'm still laughing at the moon
Good evening, we all poured our liquor out grieving
Poured our liquor grieving..

[Chorus 2: Bronze Nazareth]
Psalm pulled a pipe, like wait, I love life
Good night, sometimes you die after you see the light
He shot to the side like last night's dice
Missed the man on purpose, cause he regained his sight
Psalm pulled a pipe, like wait, I love life
Good night, sometimes you die after you see the light
He shot to the side like Antonio McDyess
Missed the man on purpose, cause he regained his sight

[Outro: Bronze Nazareth]
And that's how it goes, when it goes how it goes..</pre>
