Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
Yeah
For all the rappers
That are the worst emcees that I ever heard in my life
This one's for you (yeah, yo)

[Pennywise]
If you ever loved a good rapper that could really rhyme
then you can understand I'm goin nuts about to lose my mind
Yo I'm speakin as a fan first, I'll show you what a fan's worth
You wanna trade your backpack so you can rock a man purse?
What part of the game is that? So I'm here to take it back
And if you suckers wanna battle come and spit it on a track
And I'ma lay you on your back first
The worst I ever heard and some of these rappers got the nerve man
How you act tough when your jeans are so tight?
Couldn't even move your legs if you was runnin from a fight
This is hip-hop, the one and only culture of the have-nots
Where niggaz rock hoodies, shootin dice up in the stash spot
Instead of havin street cred, you typin on a laptop
Snatch you by your neck and turn your dreads into a flattop (OH~!)
Either way the record's gonna keep screamin "Thanks For the Listen"
If you got offended on the real I'm not trippin

[Random]
Mega Ran, yeah
Brothers heard the first joint, told me Ran that's so unfair
Tried to go to y'all concerts and wasn't no one there
Wasn't no one there, told you wasn't no one there
Took it to a place where most of y'all was scared to go in there
Dawg, it's what I do, family I smash mics
Penny hit me up and he ain't even have to ask twice
Me and Cave been tight, sharper than stalagmites
Brothers from another swore I met him in a past life
Most of these rappers lack respect for the game
but what you expect, from the state that elected McCain?
Sick of the foolishness, stay out of the music biz
I Googled you and MySpace the only place you exist
Yeah, so damn right I'ma take 'em on!
Whack beats, whack rhymes, and you can't make a song
Heh, and you want to know who I'm hatin on?
You ain't even worth another bar - just sing along!

[Chorus: Random]
Homey you is real weak, I don't think you ever wanted
a rap career, so don't spend no cheddar on it
Think you do it real big, but you are forever frontin
Man I want it real bad, I can put whatever on it
You just bring me down, everytime I'm gettin up
You live wit Mom Dukes but you claim you live it up
Everyday I pray for... you to give it up
Cause I hear the same thing every single time
I say you the freakin worst, you the freakin worst
You the freakin worst, you the freakin worst
You the worst I ever heard, worst I ever heard
Worst I ever heard, I worst ever heard
I say you the freakin worst

[Mr. Miranda]
Hey yo Ran, listen
My book of life has +Notorious+ chapters
Fathered my own style, an +Inglorious Bastard+
And these rap cats think they past is serious
But it's time to sit with me yo, they story is lackin
Runnin 'round on the net sayin that they'll bomb a thread
any dude who disagree and doesn't give they song respect
But dawg you whack man, ain't nobody gonna check
out for your music I'd be TWEETIN if you on the set
Cause you the worst son, every verse dumb
Sayin that you sick but not ill enough to make a nurse come
Rap with no loyalty, and you know it's sad
When you got cats claimin they the king with no royalty
These dudes stay lame, lyrically I murder 'em all
and get away +Smooth+er than my old stage name
Travellin and all man, seldom had words
While you Sharpie pen trappers stay travellin the mall
Take it from me kid your style is trash
You couldn't make a cut if you had a pile of grass
And when I hear your record's dope, I just smile and laugh
I don't wanna build with you, never dial my math
Cause you the worst!

[Chorus]</pre>
