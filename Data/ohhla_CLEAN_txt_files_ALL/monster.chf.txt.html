[Intro]

[Chorus x2]
Can't trust every face bitch you gotta watch em
Never trust a bitch shit you gotta watch em
We just do our thang and the feds watchin'
All we do is turn up, we some damn monsters.

[Verse 1]
Can't trust every face shit I gotta watch em
Chief Keef Sosa I am on topic
Smokin' big blunts and they long body
My niggas hard body, don't fear nobody
We be in the club bitches so excited
But we don't give them nothin' but some long pipe
Because we don't trust her with their mouth about the night
We don't trust niggas, get out my sight
Four them poppin' pills and they startin' fights
Trust none mutha fucker alright
Four them poppin' pills and they startin' fights
Trust none mutha fucker alright

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
Sosa bitch a lot of niggas don't like
But I don't give a fuck, that's alright
Because I'mma do me and take all light
Put your glasses on I'm comin' strong right
Gotta get this bread for my new born
I'm a fuckin' monster with some shoes on
In dis shit I've been waitin' to long
Two face niggas, call em two tones
We just do our thang and the feds watchin
Snitch niggas makin us the feds topic
We just do our thang and the feds watchin
Snitch niggas makin us the feds topic

[Chorus x3]
