[Chorus: singer]
Man these streets, keep on calling me
Will I ever make it out of here?
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know

[Chorus]

[Joell Ortiz]
Check
Man it's somethin 'bout that rush that you get, when you cut up a brick
When you ridin by the NARCs right after bustin a lick
When you put that V in park and shorty's suckin ya dick
And you do that shit so much sometimes you fuckin forget
It's the way they respect you, the way that they fear you
No one second guess you, when you talkin they hear you
It's somethin 'bout that rubberband 'bout to pop
and dimes tryin to hold your fuckin hand walkin out the spot
E'ry day's a payday, you never try and make way
Feelin like J.J., +Dynomite+ in ya hayday (dynomite!)
They kick it like Pelé on the stair around the way day
Or wake up and say hey, spontaneous vacay
They mad like boring, you try and find Advil
It's that type morning, you spent last night ballin
God spoke to me, I know that rap's my callin
But even with these Dre's loud I hear that fast life callin

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Dawg, these streets used to have my number
Back when I had the 15-inch screen, middle console of the Hummer
Back when I thought it be my last summer
Starin at the burner nozzle wider than a plunger where on sight they would expunge ya
Had I stayed up wouldn'ta lasted long
Taught me e'rythang that my high school didn't have classes on, older niggaz passed it on
There's a gap in our generations, these younger dudes is saints
We used to ask who was snitchin, but nowadays who ain't?
Had to keep the fo'-pound, e'ry block had a Zoe Pound
If a showdown where that go down they'll turn this shit to a ghost town
Lost so many niggaz we could be goin fast
Honesty don't think a morning passed I wasn't mourning who had passed
Then after that, life expectancy, we don't expect to see
There's a bunch of niggaz breathin right now that's dead to me
I'm, one of the few that made it out the hood successfully
I lose all my celebrity, all my Rugers left with me (taha)

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, Slaughterhouse nigga, uh
Every now and then you gotta demonstrate, bust a nigga head for old time's sake
Look at what those signs say
Welcome to the D, the city that's sittin inside the Mitten, you know the crime state
Where Jimmy Hoffa's body's locked away in a safe
In time, in a place where not even time's safe, I wear a hoodie to war
They talkin about me now, "I wonder would he mature"
Supposed to be lookin for me now, claim I'm hidin from you now
Until you find me with my foot in your door
The streets said I made a sextape, no the fuck I didn't
If I did then MTV woulda nominated me for a Woody Award
That's off the topic though
Niggaz walked in my house and went shoppin in my closet, dawg I'm not the sto'
With everything I do, niggaz still shit on me
See Boogie Brown told me "Get over it nigga this ain't like you"
So I'ma take her advice
And move on from you niggaz, try to move on me I'ma take yo' life!
