[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Shawty no jokin'...
And I'm hopin'...
'Cuz I'm not slowin'...
Gotta just keep on rollin'...

[Chorus 2X: Kid Cudi]
I'm joking (young boy movin' fast...)
And I'm hoping (prayin' that I don't crash...)
(All I know is) I'm not slowing...
Gotta just keep on rolling; gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused

[Wale]
Only live once, I'mma live mine up, fill up the plug, lemme light my blunt
I don't really know what the fuck's in my cup but a couple shots of it got a nigga on stuck
I'm just here to have a good time, a little white chick, a little white wine
Out of town, spent a couple nights at TAOs, smokin' weed in the suite 'til we out of towels
And don't bother me, high as shit from my broccoli
Fly as shit for no goddamn reason and y'all aight but y'all not like me
MMG and that's my clique, that's BOA, see that's my set
CDG shit match my kicks, an apostrophe I'm behind that S
Or the black Beemer back to pick me up, backwood, the tree I'm ashin' out
See I be kicking my raps good, with or without sales; I'm killing these blackheads, my rap is Noxema
Light it up for a nigga, one or two hoes ain't enough for a nigga
One or two bottles ain't enough for a nigga, Red Berry everywhere, got Puff getting jealous

[Chorus]

[Wale]
One night love: I'mma need that, he could own that, shawty, I'mma lease that
I'mma put you in the game where your cleats at, I'mma sign that work and release that
I don't be where the crabs or police at, I just be where the cash and the freaks at
Smoking Green Bay nigga, I'm a cheesehead in a Lambo, see me where the G's at
Ha, ha, 10K in my camos, word, 10 Js and I can't move
Shades: LV was a little dough; I'm going hard for the days I was piss poor
And go hard cause I feel it's only right to, Maybach, G.O.O.D music: the right move
Girls say everything that I write smooth, fuck rap, I'm getting pussy off a Haiku
One time for the girls with the right shoes, fuckin' with a dude probably the right move
Two times for the chicks with the right bag, if it's right tonight, I might bite that
3 times, show me your peace sign, not with your hand girl, open your knees out!
Look, money what we 'bout, stuntin' when we out; Double M-G - out!

[Chorus]</pre>
