2- Uhhh...ok
1- Yeah, let it run
1- Oh we recordin?
2- Uhh yeah
1- Oh
2- Spit that shit nigga
1- Gonna spit this shit here

[Verse 1: Kemo]
I'll take you back to when I was a kid
When I used to let them Kirkwood bitches suck my dick
Hope I don't be doin no time when the summer end
Now add 2 to 99 bitch what you come up wit?
Real nigga STL, the fuckin slums
I kill niggaz that's too big, I got my gun
Now I slept up wit some mattresses and couldn't eat
I'm tryin to make my way from steak and pickin pigs feet
From rollin 6 deep, bustin out the wager-neer
See I'm a hunter, but bitch I ain't cappin deer
I'm tryin to put some muthafuckas in some body bags
Hol' 9, flatline through your body bag
Thurl shit, thurl figgas, and thurl clothes
Thurl click, thurl niggaz and thurl hoes
The world thinkin that Kemo ain't up on his toes
I watch my fuckin back cuz I never know all my foes
Muthafucka

[Hook: 1- Kemo  2- Kaos]
2- What the fuck you niggaz comin wit?
1- Da Hol' 9 dogg
2- Oh you niggaz got some thurl shit?
1- Right on it derty
"What the fuck y'all niggaz workin wit?"
1- We wit that nah'jae
"So where you wanna meet us at?"
1- Down in the lobby

[Verse 2: Mr. McFeezee]
Da Hol' 9 derty, pounds and swoll dimes derty
A hustle horse so I can 'ford mines derty
Betta watch yo back you wouldn't think
That a nigga like me would come across that ass and snatch that mink
Watch how you shine, put ya face in the front of articles
Don't interrupt the way I'm breakin down my particles
Just first for work, betta believe that I'm the first to jerk
Aim perticipatin hard portions of the game
When you itch my click, which you carry plushisions of dick
30 pounds, fake problems plus hittin them bricks
Da Hol' 9 nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kaos]
You can't get no mo outta me, I'm like hoes wanna get they tube socks
The 9 is my strap, keeps it on my back that plus my shoe size
I'm a thurl ass cat wit 9 lives but y'all can cut, its like yo lawn mower
Da Hol' 9 wit me see I'm like that combo, nah mo
6 times the niggaz try to subtract and divide Da Hol' 9 but he was just voient
Cuz he knowin the shit like 2 loads up in the toilet
We like 2 straights up in that sergeant, got you by margin, got Mr. McFarland
And none of this shit is funny like Shining Marlin
I remember when you give me play, but now its he say, she say
You fine now, he rhyme now, Kaos he DJ
He bring that heat up through them speakers girl he on the Beat
Plus he fuck wit Trisha and Shaniqua but them freaks skeet
But you see these hoes keep my name in they mouth like dick
But I don't get it, I must be the shit (derty you ain't get it)
I guess you right though, who's gives a fuck about a lil trife ho?
That shit be blowin, pass a nigga the fuckin light mo..

[Kaos]
....Blow him, THATS ITS RUSS!
That's track engineer (laughing)
NEXT TRACK DICK FACE! </pre>
