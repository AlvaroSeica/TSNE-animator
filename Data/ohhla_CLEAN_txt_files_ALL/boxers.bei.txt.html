Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Unh, jukebox
You just look so good
You got my boxers on

Standin' in the kitchen
Cookin' on the stove
Nothin' but my boxers
Some high heels on

Girl you look so good
Yeah you look so good

You got the radio on
Playin' yo song
Doin' yo dance
Get it baby gone

'Cause you look so good
Yeah you look so good

I could sit here and watch you all day
Got me lost for words
What can I say, girl?
I ain't never seen my clothes fit nothing like that that that that that, no
You ain't gotta wear no lingerie,
Never let you go, nuh unh, no way, girl
Don't stop, keep going
Bring it back back back back back

She wanna wear my boxers
And it looks so sexy
So I ain't gone stop her
Baby girl so fly,
I'm saying "oh my"
Man how could I stop her
When she look so sexy
Wearing my boxers,
Wearing my boxers?
Gon' gon' put'um on (Gon' put'um on girl)
Gon' put'um on (Gon' put'um on)
Woah, Woah...
And when she got'um on
Gon' do ya dance (Gon' do yo dance girl)
Gon' do ya dance (Gon' do ya dance)
Slow, slow...

Standin' in the mirror
Somethin' like a model
Body full of curves
Somethin' like a bottle

Girl you look so good
Yeah you look so good

Walkin' all around the crib
With no shirt on
Just my shorts
Get it baby gone

'Cause you look so good (so good)
Yeah you look so good (yeah baby I)

I could sit here and watch you all day
Got me lost for words
What can I say, girl?
Cause I ain't ever seen my clothes fit nothing like that that that that that, no
You ain't gotta wear no lingerie,
Never let you go, nuh unh, no way, girl
Baby nah don't stop,
Bring it back back back back back

She wanna wear my boxers
And it looks so sexy
So I ain't gone stop her
Baby girl so fly,
I'm saying "oh my"
Man how could I stop her
When she look so sexy
Wearing my boxers,
Wearing my boxers?
Gon' gon' put'um on (Gon' put'um on girl)
Gon' put'um on (Gon' put'um on)
Woah, Woah...
And when she got'um on
Gon' do ya dance (Gon' do yo dance girl)
Gon' do ya dance (Gon' do ya dance)
Slow, slow...

Now don't get me wrong
You look great La Perla
Good in them Vickies
Believe me it's tempting,
Good with your hair in a bun just loungin'
Baby you're my queen, all I wanna do is crown ya
I love how you look with my boxers on
I feel like Dame Dash when the Roc was on
Like I'm on the west coast back when Pac was on
Have you hittin' high notes like a opera song

This girl super sexy wit' my draws on
If all men dogs, I'm just tryna get my paws on
Pretty face and her skin all soft
I wouldn't mind if you let them fall off

She wanna wear my boxers
And it looks so sexy
So I ain't gone stop her
Baby girl so fly,
I'm saying "oh my"
Man how could I stop her
When she look so sexy
Wearing my boxers,
Wearing my boxers?
Gon' gon' put'um on (Gon' put'um on girl)
Gon' put'um on (Gon' put'um on)
Woah, Woah...
And when she got'um on
Gon' do ya dance (Gon' do yo dance girl)
Gon' do ya dance (Gon' do ya dance)
Slow, slow...</pre>
