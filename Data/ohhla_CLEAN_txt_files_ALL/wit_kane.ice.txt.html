Caution, red alert, time to do work
Mammy with the wet lips sippin on some crist'
And em
Over there, honey drinking double dares
Smoking blunts everywhere sayin peace to Premier
Yeah, ass shakin, get this thing poppin
Ass for the takin, got that shit rockin
Bitches one side, niggas on the next
We thinkin about cake, they talkin about sex
I'm talkin toastas and roastas, ain't always tryin to pose
I'm gettin closer and closer that gun push your nose up
Y'all feel, me feel me, even if you can't see me
From the streets to the beat, let it go, yo watch me freak
Okay, here's the final round, this is how it goes down
I got six loaded clips, sick corroded clips
Double dare everywhere, Hennesee and the Cris'
We gettin drunk and smoked out whole room gettin choked out
Hydro and a flow, this bitch wanna talk but nope
Stay strong, nothing love of my team
The part I play is wrong, but we got to get the dream
By any means we stay doin our thing
Motherfuckers so dumb they can't figure where it's coming from
They got schools wrong, all they do is pull triggers
All they do: dig out bitches, some even diggin niggas
What the fuck? The rap game changin everyday
Hard rocks walk away, now this shit is turning gay
All I say, you come hear it with me, you get your shit broke the fuck up
Your cap get twisted, I spit it
Just Ice, collossus, immortal
Any time that I come I got some bangin shit for you
so y'all just chill, sit back relax
That real motherfucker is back, that's a rap
Gangsta

Look, I'm from the streets where them kids like clapping
??? got themselves the midnight dragon
Got right out the game and had to get right back in
Any day, shit might happen
And that be on the real, cats be on your heels
Cats beyond reveal
I got niggas that seen trial
I got some niggas about to walk the green mile
Up in the penial
Meanwhile i try to excel deeper
Make my pockets smell sweeter
With cheddar spreading more than bel vida
Make sure you flip the dough
In the the two triple o
Come through sip the Mo'
I be that true gigolo
See me gettin assed in the ride
Scrub style from the passenger side
You askin to die?
Shit, couldn't fuck with this on your best night
I scream let's fight
Niggas turn transvestite
And don't dress right
When the red light is headed at your chest sight
You just might, wanna check your vest tight, nigga
