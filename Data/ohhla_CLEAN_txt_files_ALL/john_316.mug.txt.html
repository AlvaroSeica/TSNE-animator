[Wyclef Jean]
This is not the burial, it's the ressurection
Hey kids gather 'round (All around the world)
It's DJ Muggs, with Wyclef (Yeah, all around the world)
Aha, I got a story to tell (All around the world)
Check it out, c'mon

[Chorus]
What do you mean, John 3:16?
For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16
(uh-huh) Says the boy to the fiend
What do you mean?  Huh (uh-huh)
What do you mean, John 3:16?
For God so loved the world, every one packs an M-16
I wanna wake up from this dream 
(I wanna wake up from this dream) Check it out

[Verse One]
I caught the bullet, I was stumblin like a mulet
Drink white Russian; game, Russian roulette
Flight Continental six o'clock in the mornin
Briefcase full o' cocaine on my way out, I tipped the doorman
Jumped into the cab said, "Hail Mary, full of Grace"
Yesterday communion was the Mafia's reunion
Confessed to the priest, evade the apple, I ate the peach
Slept with Vanity, sold my soul to Robin Leach
Devil music in my ear, no fear, I'm pumpin Def Leppard
Slow down, here comes the narc' with the German shepherd
I got the plan, man, meet me in the van
I got this kid from the Sudan bringin tecs from Iran (uh-huh)

[Chorus]
What do you mean, John 3:16?
For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16
Says the boy to the fiend (All around the world)
(uh-huh) What do you mean?  What do you mean?
What do you mean, John 3:16?
For God so loved the world, every one packs an M-16
Says the girl to the fiend (uh-huh)
So in the streets, the product must be clean (uh-huh)

[Verse Two]
Five-eleven, the young one went to heaven
Yo with the gun to his head; yo he was already dead
Sunday mornin in court, the judge got Wyclef confessin
"Yo, I murdered Steve Austin," now I'm wanted by Bionic Woman
Women bring you more miseries like that movie
Stress go to India, smoke hashish with Ghandi (uh-huh)
My bills of rights is to make sure you're alright
Superman left the gang, cause his weakness was Crips-tonight (bing)
Godfather got the cottonballs to his cheeks
Pig couldn't fly straight so you die in your sleep
I stay awake only to see Nicodemus
The young one got murdered, the day was the Sabbath

[Chorus]
What do you mean, John 3:16?
For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16
What do you mean, says the boy to the fiend
Why we killin for the green?
What do you mean, John 3:16?
For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16
Says the girl to the fiend (All around the world)
I wanna wake up from this dream

[Verse Three]
I know this drug dealer, who drive a black beamer
Dreadlock cut off once by this girl named Delilah
Pretty little dancer, voice like Tina Turner
Chickenheads are you a virgin? Yeah right, so was Madonna!
S-s-sinner, sinner, seek the master
If not, feel the explosion from the day after
Bit by the vampire, worked for the mobster
Two to the head - and now you swimmin with the lobsters
We got'cha got'cha, set up in Oklahoma
You caught a bad one like a kid catchin pneumonia
So storyteller, what's the moral of this story?
Live reality and don't get caught up in your fantasy

[Chorus]
What do you mean, John 3:16?
For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16
Says the boy to the fiend (All around the world)
Aren't we all human beings? (uh-huh)
What do you mean, John 3:16?
For God so loved the world, every man packs an M-16 (M-16)
But the dream.. is still for green..
(so) so we die in the steam

[Wyclef Jean]
(What do you mean, John 3:16?)
This is how it is around the way, y'knahmsayin Muggs?
Wyclef.. and it don't stop
Refugee Camp, bing!
