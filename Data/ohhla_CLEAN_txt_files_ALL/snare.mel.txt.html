[Hodgy Beats]
Yo, yo, yo yo, yo
Momma called me lazy, said nothin could motivate me
Her talkin would aggravate me until I'm leavin the room
I rolled around like a pea in a spoon
When she woke me go to school, Folgers news
I'm the cool kid with a 'C' average, only a G can see past it
Dealing with absence of fathers is past tense
Why he keep getting arrested? Your reckless impressless
Yo, just let me live, I'm a teen or adolescent
Tribulations, life lessons, I go through the grow through
Wisdom isn't given, it's percepted through livin
Decisions and commitment is the broccoli and briscuits
To unreliable soul, in which I desire to go
Everyday another struggle, get your money fuck the hustle
When you think I'll give up, you got one life to live up
Take this advice, and use it like protection
Everybody make mistakes and, very few correct them

[Chorus]
They say, nigga try a little harder but it didn't work
I tried, it didn't work, so I made shit work
They told me to try a little harder but it didn't work
So I made shit work - now my shit works now my shit works

[Hodgy Beats]
Practice makes perfect, but nobody is
Rolling with the Oddly kids, I was born a star - like Ozzy kids
They in my biz, I probably did, I am an economist
I walk the Earth and coexist, someone you didn't know exist
I'm back like I'm here returnin - you're in your seat, you're squirmin
In my sermon, turbulence from all the turning
I'm just learnin as I advance to my next level
Life's a stripper, I let it dance on my gas petal
Thrash metal, she sew it special with the hash methyl
High mellow, to do a puntos into God's ghetto
Dirt devil, cleaning lives, demeanin wives
Leaving child's drawerless for drugs and drawer is the love is flawless
What's a life beyond stress, who wants it?
Its kinda like mom's gifts
Everyday another struggle get your money, fuck the hustle
When you think I'll give up, you got one life to live up

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Where, is, the, love at? (At, at)
I said, where, is, the, love at? (At, at)
Where the love at? Should I hate you 'til it gives kisses and hugs back?
Comefrom traps, where niggaz don't get out the gate, overrun laps
One way rotissi' with hats, ankle caught in cracks
Smile gats, and never facts, clever acts, now spit a better rap

[Chorus]</pre>
