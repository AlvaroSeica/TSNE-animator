[Verse One: MC Ren]
I'm ruling you niggaz, from high up above
So bow down bitches, show the Villain some love
Let the baritone seek in, getting fucked up on the weekend
Fuck the Police, motherfucker give me a drink and
Hard nigga swerving, burning the street
I done drop my fucking blunt, now it's burning the seat
See my nigga (HIGH!) then crack me a bitch
They take my ass to the crib to smoke a little bit
And laugh of all you niggaz be trying to do it
So keep your ass back, my son passed that
Niggaz ass be whack, your mama be jocking
But can't you blame that bitch, how these whores be flocking
They want the Villain, they want my ass stretched out
Tripe X shit with my nuts in their mouths
Because I'm Bout It! Bout It! nigga gotta shout it
And if I tell you I'm the best motherfucker don't doubt it

[Chorus: MC Ren] 2X
These are the tales, the Villainist Tales
These are the Tales, a nigga knows so well

[Verse Two: MC Ren]
How many whack niggaz must get dissed?
Before the Villain say: YOU CAN'T FUCK THIS!
This shit'll blow your fucking brain into pieces
When you're dealing with the Villain, niggaz dying to meet us
Whores trying to great us, every state that I'm in
And Bitch-Ass niggaz wait to hate once again
Can't help themselves, they're born a pussy
Doing this shit up in your hood but your ass is rookie
These niggaz out side posted it up by the curb
In a hurtle like a team while they're passing the herb
See the Punk-Ass Police, run up on the homies
Talking that shit, motherfucker you don't know me
Nigga I'm Ren, I'm the shit around here
Your weak ass only been rapping for a year
Shut your ass up, take your bitch and walk
Don't say a fucking word less you told to talk

[Chorus] 4X</pre>
