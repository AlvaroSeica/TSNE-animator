Typed by: damienshank@hotmail.com 

[Chorus]
I found out that I was, too young, not grown
I was, not ready for a world so cold
I was, not prepared to make it on my own
I was, not ready for what life unfolds
And it was, too much, too soon
I couldn't, tell if what I felt was false or true
I didn't, think about what I'm about to do
I'm on some, this couldn't be real this can't be true

[Hero]
I was, too young but these my people so that's ok though
I was down for anything, I'd do it if they say so
Look how they cookin' it up, I'd sit and watch their cake grow 
Wathchin' Robbie in the corner, he there snortin' yayo
And everybody actin' cool like that right there's ok though
So I walk over to him, and I'm like yo hey bro'
what the fuck are you doin'? Get away from the table
He like, this ain't nothin' but a little bit of the yayo
I got it covered plus I make the profit from sales
He actin like he hadn't heard not one of them tales
The dopest brother, knocked him and they took him to jail
There go another this hustler here was destined to fail
Convicted, but the last I heard he tried to repeal
And Eric he gone he wildin', bustin' his steel off at the popo
These are the trial and tribulations, of kids tryin' to act like grown folks

[Chorus]

[Ill Bill]
I was, too young to fall in love like Motley Crue
Too young, I pulled a gun and I shot this dude
It was over a girl, foolish pride, I was crucified
Just another youth for juvenile, doin' time
Forgive me mama, I never meant for you to cry
Went to trial, I was sent to juvy two to five
Handcuffed, a back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
And I ain't no punk, here you fix a face or get your face fixed
Facelift credit keep colored you get you face ripped
The'y'll bust your shit right open and make you leak
You better chill out, before I birthday-cake your feet
Not a bad guy, I don't wanna catch mantime 
So I chill with work-release in the back of my mind
But the guy that I popped wasn't dead, he's locked up in here now too
And wants revenge, I got shanked in my bed!

[Chorus]

[Slaine]
I was too young to say no, too young to yell nope
Old enough to taste anger, but not enough to smell hope
Thirteen years old, my beloved mother had just passed
I started puffin' grass, drinkin' forties, cuttin' class
My father always used to beat on me and bust my ass repeatedly
I couldn't wait to get a change of scenery
I never had a dream, nobody believed in me
These mean streets are the only thing I've seen defeat
I'm sixteen bein' free, chewing (vics?) and (purcs?)
Caught a OZ habit quick, and my life got worse
Cuz' now I'm sick unless I get a pill, so my head is filled
With deep schemes my tolerance I let it build
But when streetdreams and quick cash is difficult
You find you get the same high(?) from sniffin' dope
Now I'm shootin with the neighbourhood people
nobody could save me from evil, I'm a slave to the needle! ..I'm too young!

[Chorus x2]</pre>
