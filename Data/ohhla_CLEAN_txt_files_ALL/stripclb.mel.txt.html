[Hodgy Beats]
Uh-huh~! I know you like this
When I'm strappin on the Magnum, I ain't tryin to have kids
Huh - I'm nineteen and my pockets like an old man
And you a Golden Girl fuckin with a gold man
The world shivers as you hold on to my cold hand
Striptease, please, like I don't know how to slow dance
Single dollars bein thrown from the back
I got that white girl if you skinny and you black
Back shot, mascot, hair longer than Rapunzel
And she be rollin up my trees from the jungle
To top it off, she call me daddy (daddy)
Playin a game of nine holes, golf clubs and the caddy

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Broads and panty hoes in the strip club
There so many hoes in the strip club
Takin off they clothes in the strip club
Knees touchin elbows in the strip club

[Interlude: Left Brain]
Drop that ass fast, pick it up slow
I do it for the show, girl you do it for the dough

[Hodgy Beats]
I'm realistic and hella up-hillarific
There is no concealin this shit, she's ready to fuckin peel bitch
On some G shit, kush and G - strings
And stayin true to only about three things
Get money, kill 'em all, Wolf Gang nigga
Luxurious just like that woodgrain nigga
Uhh, I pack a lot I got a wood brain nigga
Try and keep up with my team but she would sprang, nigga
Me and Left Brain are in the strip club
Next to showers of bitches like we're inside a big tub
Uhhhhh, I'm tryin to get my dick sucked
Put my sportin goods down so you could pick a dick up
Shit, what I'm on pose? You want boss and the clothes
With no drawers, just for less like... ROSS

[Chorus]

[Interlude] - repeat 4X (last two times Screwed slow)
