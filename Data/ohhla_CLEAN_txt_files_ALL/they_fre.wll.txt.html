Mike Jones...Paul Wall

What you know bout livin' lavish
what you know bout reebok classics
Down south is where I stay
we sit drank and rock RBK

[Mike Jones]
I hit the block and I'm lookin' lavish
white t-shirt, pants baggin'
wit a fresh pair of reebok classics
on the grind tryin' get cash
Down south is where I stay
we sit drank and rock RBK
I hit the cabinet everday for a fresh pair
cuz I don't play

[Paul Wall]
its Paul Wall and Mike Jones
we street legends and mic breakers
its fancy footwork on my toes
I hit the club wit my reebok classics
its gotta be reebok on my shoe
their all white and they brand new
when the swishahouse and down south
we wear reeboks I thought you knew

What you know bout livin' lavish
what you know bout reebok classics
Down south is where I stay
we sit drank and rock RBK</pre>
