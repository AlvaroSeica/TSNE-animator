Artist: Joe Mafia
Album:  This One
Song:   Fam (4U)
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Sample: repeated throughout the song]
Why baby? why don't you see, ooh

[Chorus 2X: Joe Mafia]
I put it down for you, bust rounds for you
Do escape on the jake, out of town, with you
Loose gates get chase, split pie with you
Tried the truth, fam, son, I die for you

[Joe Mafia]
One, Treasurer, I miss how we used to railroad
Quit scams just to get dough, lovin' no bimbo's
Skatin' the parks and now where cats hated us
Smile in our face, stickin' our necks out for spring paper
We was thuggin' it, pushin' the Benz, a joy ride
Since the day I retracted the lie
For I should make it for my niggas who died
Who bust stop, rock the straight glock, cock it
Twistin' trees, unpredictable beat
Pissy offa Remy, with memories, of you and Tyrique
I slug for this, you stuck with me, lease
Six Benz, it's a hell of a feat
Bean sparker lighter kept me in the rice
Schoolin' me with O.G. insights
Keep your head right and keep it, what, keep the shit tight
Type, legit, laundromat shit, hold ya head son
We Syndicate, rememberin', I'm still reminiscin'
How we cost the jail, flippin' their cells and bail skippin'

[Chorus 2X]

[Joe Mafia]
What's that, rockets, lazers
Cigarettes, knowin' his elders watchin'
Flavor Flav clockin' with secure garbage
False track, on the street felon, stay reppin'
The wick rap, clap for half-steppin'
Old school fools is Smith and Wesson
You was tuggin' my coat when I was young
Thinkin' I was a precious, '86 sippin' on fifths
Heat streeters all on the mix, throwin' our dick beaters
Six greatest, told me to weed smoke and roll sneakers
R.I.P. Rolly Dolly, dry tears splash your beer
Hold my wallies, type of landing niggas, bustin' at block parties
Word to Jet, protect, I bleed for my seeds who give a fuck less
My shoulder blades is gon' haste the block, country hip hop
Shell toe Adidas and rock watts, we ain't shot cuz we flee cops
This how it go in Ghost Town, you know? We be the worldwide, wide...

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
