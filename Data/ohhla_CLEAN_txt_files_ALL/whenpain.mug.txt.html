[intro, Snoop]
to the Hill we go
dj muggs you done did it again
eastside up, eastsider
my nigga

[Verse 1, Kurupt]
I'm a soul assassin
masking hollow fashion
hollow by to follow by
chain reaction
this fight's devensivly
saddle the dogs
and pulling off the biggest heist in history
poet of anestesia
poethical fantasia
phoetic, anestatic
pimp shielding pen
war's a world of hell
like penicilline
knocking bodies from the floor to the ceilin'
you suckers
hitting like quakes
'till the whole apartment building break
so don't get sealed in
I'm in cyber space on high jack mode
high on, jack mode, fry on, clap mode
pimps, roaming like panthers
letting off like roman candles
spread like several cancers
you better hope that it develops nigga
or get folded like envelopes

[chorus, Roscoe &amp; Kurupt]
it's all about game, war
licks, chips, dicks
pussylips, grips
niggas that's alive
and niggas that was chipped
nigga what the fuck we gon' do about this?
when the pain inflicts
war, licks, chips

[Verse 2, Roscoe]
spread the news
because I'm coming to spread the blues
putting all these fake niggas
quick-to-shake niggas
on the evening news
breezing through the block
with no heat
a gang o' niggas
but no beef
a sock in the mouth
and left with no teeth
don't be scared
y'all started it nigga
no peace, no truce
and no sleep with no deuce-deuce
don't try to squash it nigga
it ain't no use
and you better never leave your stoop
unprotected
we come through in the coupe
leavin' the set lit
mano set trip, checking clip
test the spray
Y.A, D.P, S.A
A-K, S-K
heads and bodies chopped
chest is next okay
and then the get-away
I need a train ticket homie
like yesterday
so screw the plane ticket homie

[chorus, Roscoe &amp; Kurupt]
it's all about game
war, licks, chips, dicks
pussylips, grips
niggas that's alive
and niggas that was chipped
nigga what the fuck we gon'do about this?
when the pain inflicts

war, licks, chips, dicks
pussylips, grips
niggas that's alive
and niggas that was chipped
nigga what the fuck we gon'do about this?
when the pain inflicts

dogg pound gangster assassins
putting it down
the Y.A, Y2k
S.A, D.P.G
this is Roscoe
whatup muggs

we dont give a fuck
never gave a fuck (repeated)

[Verse 3, Roscoe]
we gon' load the clips
call all o' the homies
and load the whips
reign in enemy terain
and flood it with hollow tips
looney tunes
watching the moon eclipse the sun
dumping of rooftops
making our average ave' run
burry your guns
rule number one; dont need
no evidence, no heads and no leads
get away untouched
they'll never know it was us
we do it just like this
when the pain inflicts

[Kurupt]
have you ever been to the houseparty in the hood?
niggas gotta scrap with somebody in the hood
as soon as it pops
the party gon' stop
and the candypants drop
pancake's and hops
blackjack's and bricks
milli mag's and clips
indica mushrooms
axe and sticks dip
well come take a ride to my hood
where's its all to the gravy
and all to the good

[chorus, Roscoe &amp; Kurupt]
game, war, licks, chips, dicks
pussylips, grips
niggas that's alive
and niggas that was chipped
nigga what the fuck we gon' do about this?
when the pain inflicts

war, licks, chips, dicks
pussylips, grips
niggas that's alive
and niggas that was chipped
nigga what the fuck we gon' do about this?
when the pain inflicts</pre>
