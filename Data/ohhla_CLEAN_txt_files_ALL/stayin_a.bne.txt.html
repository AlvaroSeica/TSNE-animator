Yeah yeah
Gangstas, thugsters, hustlers and pimps
Scramblin tryin to get it right, yeah we tryin to live our life
Gamblin, robberies, murderers and thieves
Yeah we tryin to get it right, prayin up under the city lights
Gangstas, thugsters, hustlers and pimps
Scramblin tryin to get it right, yeah we tryin to live our life
Gamblin, robberies, murderers and thieves
Yeah we tryin to get it right, prayin up under the city lights
 
It's a little bit safer during the day, when the kids is out to play
But when the street lights come on you better be takin that ass home
Doin our dirt up under the sun, but the moonlight is dimmer
January down to December through the spring, fall and winter
You learn to survive, in the ghetto, better take than get took
Sellin that yayo on the corner nigga better break or get booked
Look, po-po is on that ass, them jackals is on that ass
It's the crackheads that make the laws but it's the niggaz you got to blast
Cause they cutthroat, and sheisty!
One-eighty-seven the lesson the niggaz that's frontin they might be
The only way a nigga make it out of the ghetto and that's real
Combat on contact, nigga kill or be killed - swear fo' God
Thug life is serious, my heart is near and dear to this
So many pause to understand this, I wanna smoke the cannibus
Can't forget the hood, cause they represent the struggle right
Money, women, power, respect; that's just a soldier's life
 
[Chorus: Thin C.]
You can tell by the way that I get this dough
And I crack my toes I'm a hustler babe
Tell by the way that I talk my talk
And I walk my walk I'm thuggin baby
I, I, I, I'm, sayin alive  stayin alive
I, I, I, I'm, gettin mine  mean green
 
[Layzie Bone]
Green light Caddy coupe, stackin like it's Mercedes Benz
Malibu's and heavy Chevy's, every day we stackin ends
Some niggaz take on the bridge while other niggaz they fumble wit it
Make it out and start a business while other niggaz they crumble wit it
Need work? Well come and get it, best believe I got mine
I represent for the O.G.'s and the hustlers that got time
City sets the attention from one jumper to the next jumper
Land breathe easy, we always ready to rumble
Ain't it a wonder, how I keep from goin under
And they tell us we should shoot for the stars (that's some bullshit)
But it ain't no wonder, when you feel the pain and thunder
Motherfuckers'll rather shoot up your car (motherfucker!)
See by the church it's a liquor sto', by the liquor sto' it's a crackhouse
All in the pot of gumbo, now you know what we rap 'bout
Ain't no vaccine for crack fiends, just pipe dreams ain't no rice
Do yo' thing it's yo' life, I'ma ball up under the city lights
 
[Chorus]
 
[Layzie Bone]
Some of these niggaz I grew up with is niggaz that I don't fuck with
I done came up and they ain't so niggaz be on some dumb shit
They hatin me and my hardwork, my territory is standard
I'm connected down in A-T-L, from Tennessee to Kansas
Hell yeah I planned this, I was tryin to get off the block
Slang rap or slang rocks, keep it movin or get popped
Non-stop, was my hustle mode, constantly grinding
Get it so much I'm on the nuts I guess I'm just, grimy
Find me, showin love, dippin with Mississippi thugs
Look at me I'm grippin my nuts, get it if you got the guts
Code to the streets say, fuck a "he say she say"
Do a nigga face to face from the suburbs to the PJ's
Never give no leeway, nigga better believe me
I always had to put in work, shit ain't never been easy
I guess I'm livin just to love for the city
And if you want me nigga come and get me, you feel me?
 
[Chorus]
