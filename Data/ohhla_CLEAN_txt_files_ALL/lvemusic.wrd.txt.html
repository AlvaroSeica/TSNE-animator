This songs dedicated to 
It doesnt matter
This song could be called a number of things
I just call it I love music
Only thing I can love
I find it hard to love anything else like

[Holy Brook]
Where'd you go?
I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

[Werd]
Every time your gone god I miss you
Every time we hug wish I could kiss you
Every time I see ya I want to whisper 
Im here for you and I miss ya
Seems like yesterday we first met
Least to me guess its my first step
My first test of my life yes
I should have said something cause now am left
With nothing at all
Just an image just a picture
Then am watching it fall
Cause all that hoped for and all that I dreamed 
Is easier to dream than it is to achieve
And at times its hard to believe
Theres someone out there thats the reason I breath
See you can think of something and not do it
And then all thats left is making that rap music

[Holy Brook]
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

[Werd]
Iv been jumped and battered by ten cunts
Hit with belt buckles and bottles and got lumps
Put on the floor got stomped and kicked
But nothing hurts more than this
But thats what u get
You do nothing get nothing dont expect
Because time waits for no man
Dont take advice take your own plan
And tell them your thoughts
Get on the mic yeah lets talk
I know the question that you just thought
Is this about a girl or just hip-hop

[Holy Brook]
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

[Werd]
I miss you like the desert done missed the rain
I miss you but I know I wont miss the pain
Of missing you since the day that you went away
Now its too damn late for you to stay
Why cant I say what I want to say
Thats how I feel like every single day
And she knows acts like she dont though
And I feel so low when I'm solo

[Holy Brook]
Please come back home...</pre>
