Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Well the clock says it's time the roll, yeah
For all you people for show
And maybe some should consider
A place that's open till four

Lights go down and you're ready for the open road
Maybe there's a chance for show
Never really know if you'll be on the other side
When it's time to come home

Realize that I'm gonna be the one who
Takes your hand while were walking through the avenue
But I'm your man I wanna take you
Oh I'm your man whose gonna make you

And then you're so far away from here
To be on your own
And then you're so far away from here
To be all alone

Never had a reason or a will to decieve you, girl
Maybe there's a chance for show
Never really know if you'll be on the other side
When it's time to come home

Realize that I'm gonna be the one who
Takes your hand while were walkin through the avenue
But I'm your man I wanna take you
Oh I'm your man whose gonna make you</pre>
