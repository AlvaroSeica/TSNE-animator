[Intro 1: Big Krizz Kalico]
Insanity at it's finest
Fire starter
Riot maker
Moon strikin'
Animal need
Bad seed
Untamable (Beast)

[Intro 2: Tech N9ne]
Everybody around me always thinks they know what's goin on inside my mind
Think I'm Mr. Nice Guy all the time
How they say on Diary, you think you know but you have no idea!

[Hook: Tech N9ne &amp; Big Krizz Kalico]
Handcuff yo hoe
Get filthy must make mo dough
We will be shakin your flow
Come against me that's a no, no, yo
Cause I'm a beast

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I can smell your women's rosey poonany on the dance floor all the way in V.I.P
I'm a rapper, I can snatch her
And she will leave with me because of my stature
Everybody move, everybody bounce
Who ever the Nina choose we about to pounce (work it out)
With the 151 in the bottle
I call Hef will he let me hit this model in the grotto
I like, all women, tall women, and small women
You got to, let Tech Niz tease your chakra
Species release freaks please the monsta
Petit beast feez these G's will rock ya
Handcuff her busta don't trust her
Round these hustlas homie don't be a sucka
When your lover say Tecca Ninas a brotha
She tryin to say that I rushed her then crushed her

[Hook - 2X]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I'm out to get that money like a robbery
Now I got it all my enemies wanna clobber me
Squalor be harder we need dollars camaraderie
The hotter these collars be the larger the lottery
Need them tens twins
Gotta succeed spend G's, Ben Franks
Weed grim cheese in banks
Breed sin we win thanks
Hungry like the wolf indeed but I give
Money to my crooks that need to live
In terminals but from Kansas City
I miss home Cali is business but man it's pretty 
I ain't lyin y'all
Monster for money for mine y'all
If I wasn't gettin' money I'd do time dog
You'll never see the N9ne fall
Big house, wood floors, maid cleanin the bitches with Pine-Sol

[Hook - 2X]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Friend this industry is no kin to me
Behold the flow of the century
But they scared of me
Rappers they don't compare to me
Far to be, said that they dares to be sincerely a rarity (Wow!)
Check the SoundScan, look around man
Wake up look at your Jacob you in killa clown land
Face paint and Juggalettes with bubble butts
And we rockin' plus the Diddy women in the button ups
Hands down we rock harder than Kiss
But rap we couldn't cris
But can I get two stomps and a clap in this bitch
Nina shot to the top cause a plots to get rich
Tell ya, executive 
I'm next for this
Success it is
Yep the best for Tech
This aint Baptist, Pentacostal or Methodist
This is the Beast baby out I mean Exodus

[Bridge: Big Krizz Kalico]
I'm mean, and I will, destroy you, I am the Beast

[Hook - 3X]</pre>
