Yeah.. crazy ol' smooth shit
Goin out to all the niggaz that be baggin up the skins
Straight up pimpin, ain't no time for simpin
To the real niggaz, all my peeps in Queens Brooklyn Uptown
Bronx there it is

Yo, me and my niggaz bounce around in the jeep
Lookin for a spot to peep where the freaks is real deep
2000's kinda hittin, 20 beans we up in it
Hold up - WAIT A MINUTE!
Hookers wall to wall, small to tall, from slim to mad (?)
Dead ass, every man for self
This first tip I spotted, sittin at the bar was a hot one
Let me ask a question bout your man shorty, you got one?
Not one, but two, matter of fact black a few
but there's room for you - now shit is through
Disnexone was MAD fat, even her wrists was clumpin
She kept tailin me like I was a Twinkie or somethin
To make sure, Oprah wouldn't follow me no more
Aiyyo bitch, there's free food at the do'
I stepped to disnexone, she was pumpin with a trunk full of junk
Rump was pumpin but her breath smelled like a garbage dump
EWWW! Opened her grill, to give me a reply and
.. OH MY GOD I JUST WANNA DIE! ..
Bounced to the nexone, now shorty was lookin real cute
Karl Kani suit, baseball cap, and high tech boots
Dancin her ass off, so I starts to get open
People scopin, I guess that we look real real dope an'
she says I'm cute, we shoot breeze for a bit
I got the digits I'm ghost, nuttin to it
Went upstairs and DAMN, disnexone was irie
Doin the butterfly to the rub-a-dub stylee
I was all set to knab her, grab her
When she turned around oh shit, she looked like Shabba
Goes to the nexone, but only cause she was mad pretty
On the real she was down with the itty bitty tittie committee
Ass was flat, combo wasn't alla that
So I left that heffer sittin where she sat
Disnexone grabbed me, let's go dance somewhere money
Got in the light, yikes, "STROBELITE HONEY!"
Now disnexone was a friend, from around the way
Hangin with this cute thick white girl, "Fuckin A!"
So I like, started talking language, she couldn't understand
and OH MY GOD! I got her number, totally awesome man
Slid on the nexone, like did you know that youse a dime baby
She tipped her glasses and looked at me, like I was crazy
Turned around and tried to play me, that bullshit don't faze me
Threw my drink on that bitch and I'm Swayze
Just then some boom smokin music came on
Went to the bathroom and like the Human Torch, flame on..

{*sounds of a joint being inhaled*}
Yeah, smoke this shit, and get back out here
See what else out there {*coughing*}

Walked to disnexone, AIYYO WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS BITCH?
Lookin white in her tight spandex suit, (?) lipstick
Licked my lips, thinkin bout how I was gonna stick her
"Yo Kwest, parlay kid, that's a nigga" (AHHHHHHHH!)
Huh, disnexone was jockin, so I let my man keep walkin
but I couldn't get with the ILL SHIT she was talkin
"I want someone to love me and my kid
 til my man's done with his bid"
Yo, now you know I fled!
Ran up on this P.R. mami, "Que lindo, hay dios mio!"
Du ju got time to conversate with me baby and chicos?
"Si papi!" So we sit and do the knowledge
Bag her then I'm out like Speedy Gonzalez, VRROOOM!
Disnexone, tried to pull the card on a Mister
"Hold up nigga, didn't you just try to kick it to my sister?"
Yeah bitch but now I'm tryin to kick it to you, but fuck it
Both of y'all ass out then like my man I'm through
Disnexone was busted beyond belief
Had seventeen.. won't even speak on that shit chief
Disnexone kicked the blahzay blah, cute little hoochie
Til she violated, askin me did I eat the fuckin coochie?
No (?) didn't even fall away from me, nobody real, word is bond
Like Cheers, I'm gone
Now, damn, really can't describe disnexone
Cause she walked past, dead-ass, my whole body flexed son
Hon's a 20, twice as nice as Bo Derek was
Shot an upside down frown, BOOM!  There it was
Brown skin milky body voice like slow music
The kind of miss that you couldn't use or abuse kid
Shot more game, than a hunter on safari in Africa
Gave me the digits, said I better get back to her
It's about, 3:30 in the A.M.
Had bagged a lot of dames, most of the names, couldn't even say 'em
Blasted out my ass, and hungry as hell
Tomorrow night I hope I do just as well, lookin fo' dat nexone

Yeah.. props to Erik Romero for the fat ass track
Definitely hooked shit up
Now, to all my peoples

Niggaz in Queens, lookin for the nexone
Uptown niggaz, be lookin for the nexone
Brooklyn niggaz they lookin for the nexone
Bronx niggaz is lookin for the nexone
Staten Island niggaz lookin for the nexone
West coast niggaz is lookin for the nexone
All around the world they lookin for that nexone
Aiyyo, fuck this, let's get done

Yeah, big Kwest comin at ya
I'm not gon' say peace cause we ain't gonna get it
But if you got a piece of ass, dead ass
I'm damn sure with it to hit it, split it
And if you try to front on me I might forget it
I'm OUTTA here</pre>
