If pain is a mind state then I'm trapped in Texas
With an empty bottle of Percocet 
And a wrinkled brow folded with regret 
Shadow displaying a slouched silhouette 
With curse words behind me and a casted off taken for granted sunset
Teeth chattering, from amnesia 
Living a moment my memory with dilute 
Atrophied tongue, with a swollen ankle and a pair of crutches
For a pair of feet touching a yellow brick substitute
Floating from the numbness while the moths keep hitting near my light bulb
I got an IV of life and more tape on me then a broken window 
Bladder paralyzed, the sunshine peels my fermented skin
Bolts in my kneecap, wrench in the trash
Tyler Dirten's laughing
Eggs for breakfast and lost time for dessert 
But these children keep hatching 
My eyes look like raccoons, flesh under my nails 
And blood on my pillow from the scratching 

This is life, this is life, it's so fun
This is life, this is life, I have none 
This is life, this is life, it's so fun
This is life, this is life, I have none 

I took a leap of faith and they found me on the rocks
My clock doesn't tick it's just a bunch of tocks
I'm going here and there, but I'm standing still
The people walk on by just looking for a thrill
They're looking here and there to rise above the dim
They don't even realize they have to look within
To ride your highs and endure your lows
As long as coasting nothing will change that's just the way it goes

Now, forewarned is forearmed but I only have two 
Ones usually in a cast and deflated lungs got me feeling blue
Pliers on molars, assistant holding my tongue back 
Teeth falling out but I'll never get a gum graph
Hospital rooms echo with silence
And to make a living I slave in the basement 
Yawning in doctors' offices, painting myself with patience
Let my retinas constrict to the glow 
Slit me ear to ear and watch my smile grow
There's paper cranes in the sky and metal birds making clouds 
Almost had my life paid for 
Now I'm wrapped in a blanket of shame but my parents are still proud 
Everyone else is a landmine for heartbreak
But I keep stepping on backs with a bloody knee 
And my ears ringing from the explosions
And I keep a brace around my Achilles 
Cause I don't like babies and never trusted a Trojan
And when my voice gets hoarse from the yelling 
I strap a saddle on until laryngitis takes full effect
Gallop off the cliff and ride into the ocean until my scalp is wet

I took a leap of faith and they found me on the rocks
My clock doesn't tick it's just a bunch of tocks
I'm going here and there, but I'm standing still
The people walk on by just looking for a thrill
They're looking here and there to rise above the dim
They don't even realize they have to look within
To ride your highs and endure your lows
As long as coasting nothing will change that's just the way it goes

This is life, this is life, it's so fun
This is life, this is life, I have none 
This is life, this is life, it's so fun
