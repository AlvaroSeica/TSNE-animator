[Chorus]
Just wanna spend
The rest of my
Life with you
Be your bonnie
Be my clyde
We'll make these cowards run &amp; hide
And I just wanna spend
The rest of my
Life with you
Through the goodtimes &amp; the bad
Boyfriend
Girlfriend
Mom &amp; dad
Whatever

I search for a chick like me who blows dro
Cause she can appreciate how the sticky burns so slow
You know
A young chick with an old soul
Set through the fire
Just to hold hands while the coals glow
I'll build a house around her
We could fill it with seeds
And be like adam &amp; eve
In the garden of eden
We can grow old
Watch it rain &amp; snow
And see the sun rise &amp; fall over yonder no
And when the coals burn out
Cause one of is gone
And the other is broken hearted
Left to live life alone
You used to listen to me complain
About my real bad days
Rub my neck &amp; back
And make it all go away
Always there with an encouraging word
I couldn't imagine
Having to be here without her
And I'm so scared of losing you
She say boo boo
I'm never gonna leave you
And then she sang to me

[Chorus]
Just wanna spend
The rest of my
Life with you
Be your bonnie
Be my clyde
We'll make these cowards run &amp; hide
And I just wanna spend
The rest of my
Life with you
Through the goodtimes &amp; the bad
Boyfriend
Girlfriend
Mom &amp; dad
Whatever

Lil momma your eyes
The candle light magnifies
Hazel turned grey
Then bluer than a summer day
Baby wanna run away
Far away to some other place
Where we can lay
Tangled in one anothers embrace
By the fire place
Till were old &amp; grey
From roca wear to rockin chairs
Whatever you need
Just call &amp; I'm a be there
Wasn't prepared to lose you
It hurt me so
You were addictive
And letting you go
Was no
Walk through the park
I remember the nights
That I'd just sat there in the dark
Pistol beside me
Ready to use it writing a will in a
Book where I had once wrote music
And then I remember
Somethin you once said
Layin next to me
Naked breathin heavy in the bed
You said

[Chorus]
Just wanna spend
The rest of my
Life with you
Be your bonnie
Be my clyde
We'll make these cowards run &amp; hide
And I just wanna spend
The rest of my
Life with you
Through the goodtimes &amp; the bad
Boyfriend
Girlfriend
Mom &amp; dad
Whatever

Police pull us over
I'm squeaky clean haha
28 grams in your bra
While I
Blaze the haze as we rode off
How could you be so hard
And still so soft
All the nights we used to ride
Held my tone
Got my name tatted right above your pelvic bone
My luck uh
Middle saprano
All of my heart
Homicide detectives
Have to pry us apart
Who'd of thought we'd part
The way that we did
Just a few short months
After makin a kid
Does your new man
Do it like that
Candle wax
Down the small of your back
Does he
Bite your neck
Does he nibble on your colar bone
Do you still think about me
When your all alone
Used to grab you
And hold you tight
The heat will be back on tommorow
But it's cold tonight

[Chorus]
Just wanna spend
The rest of my
Life with you
Be your bonnie
Be my clyde
We'll make these cowards run &amp; hide
And I just wanna spend
The rest of my
Life with you
Through the goodtimes &amp; the bad
Boyfriend
Girlfriend
Mom &amp; dad
Whatever</pre>
