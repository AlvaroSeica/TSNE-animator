You know you don fucked up right?
Ha Ha, Pun
S-E-R uh V
Nigga, what up, what up, huh?
Nigga what?

[Mr. Serv-On]
From NY to NO, motherfucker biggy sized
My motherfuckin platinum, nigga this is for sho
Yall don't know
Nigga Pun represent Terror Squad, I represent the tank
Ya need to go to the drive, to hustle get the small change
Nigga we got the fuckin bank
Nigga ask P, if I ever broke rank, nigga I can't
Nigga I come to your motherfuckin town, slap the fuck out of you nigga
And surely put a tank on your chest
Who the fuck you playin with
Nigga why the fuck are ya'll scared when you see the tank around my neck
Nigga what ya'll wanna do, nigga I stay rowdy
Nigga I fucked up and talked about yall bout it
Yall don't know me, that's why yall can't fuck with me
I was born not to lose
And how the fuck it gon hit me between this bitch, I choose
Nigga let's play a game of Family Feud
One, never see my real name
Two, how the fuck you gon bounce with a nigga like me when you can't take pain
Three, it ain't nuttin, that's why I'm fuckin with Pun
Nigga so I can get my motherfuckin money, get the fuckin job done

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
[Big Pun] Big stun with the big guns
[Serv-On] Serv-On get yo swerve on
[P + S-O] New York to New Orleans
[P + S-O] Shit is doper then morphine
[P + S-O] Hit the streets gettin more cream
[P + S-O] Makin all the whores scream

[Big Pun]
Ain't nuttin but the hardcore created inside of my laboratore
Why keep all the war, shit stored in separate corridors
Songs drippin the Art of War, Symphonies by Marley Marl
We got it all, pa', the squad follows the protocol
Speaking of protocol, I'm the protocol, when you go to war
Cause my death count amount to more overall
so throw the ball - you can't handle the rock
I'll dismantle your block if you just hand me the glock
I'm ready to rock like n'roll, glock like wino
Pop up in your block in the drop top limo
What's the problemo, throw some espa√±ol in it
Niggaz stutterin its Pun, and na, na No Limit
Scared to death, you ain't got no hair on your chest
My shit is Chuck Norris, look like two bears having sex
That's a lot of hair like Samson I generate my power there
and you outta here I'm worse than Raul with two hundred bottles of beer
It ain't fair whoever said life was sweet
Your wife wouldn't cheat, everything was nice in the streets
Advice for the weak, grab the biggest bottles of the pills on the shelf
And swallow the motherfuckers cause you better off killin yourself

[Chorus]

[Mr. Serv-On]
Shit
Nigga I done come motherfuckin two thousand miles
Just to make you bitch ass niggas understand
Uh, Terror Squad, No Limit
Ha ha, real shit nigga
Ha ha, soldiers, players
This nigga here
I got the biggest motherfuckin man on the coast nigga
Pun nigga, you fuck alot, I blast alot
Put that together nigga, ain't nothin but money baby
And number one and a fifties
You bunch of bitches
Bitch ass niggas out there
