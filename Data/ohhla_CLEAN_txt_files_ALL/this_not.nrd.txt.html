[Intro]
Somebody's bringin me closer to the ground
I ain't panicked - I been here before
Seems like only yesterday when I uploaded those albums
and showed the internet who was who, and what was what
MAAAAN, look at these suckers
I ain't no rapper - I'm a nerd!
Just so happens I know how to rap!
Okayyyyy, I'm reloaded!

[Nerd Ferguson]
One, two, three, uhh
Nerd - hope y'all knew!
Best album of the two oh one two
Got a fat ass, hoe come through
If you don't like me well hoe fuck you (yup!)
Everybody fuck with kid, even drug dealer kids
I relate to the dope boys too
So fuck what you heard; but only fly chicks
if what you heard's my dick - get it? Word
Everything I spit is ab-surd
Everything you spit gets on, nerves
Gonna have a hard time gettin any spins
when I'm in the game so you better get on, first
Niggaz hear my shit and they clap and applaud
Hoes hear my shit, make it clap in they drawers
I don't got a whole lot of dough but I know how to flow
so the hoes give me {ass in the car}
Pyoom pyoom pyoom, blastin at y'all
Niggaz blast back and I'm laughin it off
Yeah I got a sick flow, but when I spit though
best believe I'm not laughin at all
I'm a hastag you all, #ComeAfterMe
Actually, all you cats comin after me is blasphemous
Niggaz whack as shit, attackin this
is like basketball without the basket or ball~!
I don't do punchline rap (nope)
I don't do tough guy rap (nope)
But I spit shit niggaz listen to
when they tired of listen to you dumb guys rap (uhh)
Won't find me on WorldStar
but I bet you find my CD in your girl's car
CD, nigga get your shit straight
Fuck what they say - this is not a mixtape {*echoes*}</pre>
