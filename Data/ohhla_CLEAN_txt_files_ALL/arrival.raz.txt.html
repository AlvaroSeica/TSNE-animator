(Intro)
They wanna know why...
Hell Razah became Heaven Razah
For ten years I gave you Hell Razah
You know?
That was the younger side of me
That was the material side
That was the... the flesh
Now I'm gon' give you the Heaven Razah
That's the spiritual side
That's the man side
The six-point star in me
So I'm a let the halo glow
And I'm a let my wings go up
And I'm a take you wit me

[Hell Razah]
Until the chariots' swing low
I got an Elohim glow with Zechariah eyes
Dreams in the UFO
I've been to hyperspace, cosmic angelic mode
Hypothetically we speaking in schematic code
It's all Kemetic connected because we magnetic
My woolly hair's electric
My energy is halo, my energy is fatal
More militant then NATO
If I was born in the past I would of inspired Plato
I'm independent, only signing to God's label
The double-minded is unstable, they're prenatal
So I'm detaching your spinal cord for free cable
With a cesarean cut below Eve's naval
My seven Chakra's rotate around like helicopters
Then I'll reverse with Kabbalah curses of witch doctors
That sent the Queen of the Damned by the name Akasha
She sip poisonous vodka listening to dark opera
Infidelity lust but I don't trust nada
Since the Gay Boule merge with CIA
They killed the image of Pac and gave you Kanye
From my bottom to my 33rd vertebrate
I gotta pray before I end up wit a murder case
But if I'm destined I'm more desperate then Led Zeppelin
I'm one-two-steppin' until its Armageddon
But recommended, no pun intended, you get offended
I'm a take you to Heaven

(Outro)
Put on your axe not helmet
Be ready

History!
