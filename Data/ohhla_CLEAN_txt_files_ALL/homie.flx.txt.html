[Intro: Young Jeezy] (Funkmaster Flex)
Fingers in the air! Yo Flex what it do nigga! (You see me!)
Who they mad at nigga?! (GRRRR!!!!!) Me or they self?
[Mustard on the beat hoe!] Fuck 'em all!
It's the world nigga! Fuck 'em all!
Fuck 'em all! WHAT! WHAT! LET'S GO!

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Bill up in here on this alcohol, and it's still mu'fuck 'em all
Quit playin boy you know me?! While we at it boy you owe me
More you stay the same more they need a change
It's a dirty world and a dirty game
Quit playin boy you know me! And he use to be the homie

[Verse One: Young Jeezy]
Dear Lord my God baptized in this vodka
but a nigga need to go and get his life right
Drinkin all day e'ry day clubbin in between
and a nigga still caught up in the night life
Watch the homie turned snake
Shoulda been a dummy brick, man these niggas so fake
I see death around the co'ner, hate across the street
Got Versace 'round my waist, got Versace on my feet
Swear a hundred went to shoe, nigga he ain't even know it
Only for the belt, nigga he ain't even know it
Money is the root of evil, hoe niggas be your downfall
Say you left me no choice but to stay the fuck from 'round here

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Bill up in here on this alcohol, and it's still mu'fuck 'em all
Quit playin boy you know me?! While we at it boy you owe me
More you stay the same more they need a change
It's a dirty world and a dirty game
Quit playin boy you know me! And he use to be the homie

[Verse Two: YG]
He use to be my niggas yeah he use to be my nigga
We shared the clothes and fucked the same bitches
Went to the same high school the same elementary
Now you mad is it 'cause my rollie pretty ain't she?
You use to do that white girl that I Love Lucy
Should known you was a freak 'cause how you always ate sushi my nigga! 
Damn you was my killa
But you know too much about me so I probably have to killa ya my nigga!
You the type to do a nigga like Rico did Mitch
Leave a nigga slumped in the ditch
And now I, can't stand a bitch that'll fuck a nigga homie
Have a nigga trippin on his broadies on mollies

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
Bill up in here on this alcohol, and it's still mu'fuck 'em all
Quit playin boy you know me?! While we at it boy you owe me
More you stay the same more they need a change
It's a dirty world and a dirty game
Quit playin boy you know me! And he use to be the homie

[Outro: Young Jeezy]
LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!</pre>
