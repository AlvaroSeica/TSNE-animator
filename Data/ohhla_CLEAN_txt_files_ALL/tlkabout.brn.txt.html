[VERSE 1]
Whoa oh oh oh oh
What you hear this time?
Go on and speak your mind
I know somebody's lyin'
It's always somethin'
Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in
And now the whole hood's buzzin'
He said, she said
Don't let it get in your head
Baby don't say something that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them, you'll see
Hey, we ain't gon stop
They just want what we got

[CHORUS]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about
Instead they just runnin' they mouths
So all we do is tune 'em out

[VERSE 2]
Whoa whoa oh oh oh
I swear they got some nerve
Spreadin' what they heard
I can't give them no burn
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved
That's my word
See, I'm not the one
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough?
When it comes to what we do
All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind
We just gon' show and prove

[CHORUS]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about
Instead they just runnin' they mouths
So all we do is tune 'em out

[Kanyé West]
Here's a couple of things I can't honor, man
How you listen to a girl that still wanna man?
Tell me the truth, is that a man or Juwanna Man?
I'm wonderin' why she red to go like Wanda then
When we met you was a V like Manana, man
Now you went field runnin' plays like Donavan
Knick-nav before you get in a cab
I trade in my cap
Just to take you back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember I called you Reese's Pieces
'Cause it's no wrong way to do you-know-what
She turned around, giggled, said 'you so nuts!'
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
But how ya ex-girl get that new number?
The rumors was so numerous
For sticking by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why

[CHORUS]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love? (people keep talkin' about it)
When they don't know one thing about (no)
Instead they just runnin' they mouths
So all we do is tune 'em out (go on)
The more they talk about our love (tune 'em out, baby)
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious (ooh ooh, yeah)
How can they talk about our love? (please don't talk about it)
When they don't know one thing about
Instead they just runnin' they mouths
So all we do is tune 'em out

I don't wanna hear it no more</pre>
