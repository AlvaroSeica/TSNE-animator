Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I just copped a whole brick from papi
About to hit the stove get it popping
None of my niggas moving sloppy
Meet me on the ave nigga copy
Copy, copy, copy, copy
I'll be whipping hard
Till my wrist hurt
I'll be whipping hard
Till my wrist hurt
I'll be whipping hard

Yo, yo that's word to God
Vado feed the block
With it lot of people starve
Place the weight on a plate
Then you break it down in parts
Make a move then I'm out
I don't wait around for knocks, no
Whip soft I'm pissed off
Took a week to get a brick off
No bitch here but got ripped off
Lose 50 grand every missed call
It's a cold world on my block
Punk rock pull the whole work on my block
Mailbox where I hold work on the block
Red toss we a whole work on the block
Man, hit papi, tell him I need ten copy
TNT gonna see the monopoly
Move swift through thin ice like hockey
This the number to wait for dealing weight for
Hand me a plate I don't care who ate more

I just copped a whole brick from papi
About to hit the stove get it popping
None of my niggas moving sloppy
Meet me on the ave nigga copy
Copy, copy, copy, copy
I'll be whipping hard
Till my wrist hurt
I'll be whipping hard
Till my wrist hurt
I'll be whipping hard

The going price for a brick is 43
That's Kendrick Perkins
I'm selling hard if it's up to me
Break it down in all eight balls, find MJG
That's old school that's West Coast that's E-A-SKI
All I know about is getting money
Till the sun come up
Dominicana with a calculator
When they see my face I watch'em all run up
My heist run was a nice one
Couldn't take the trip and had a paranoid
I'm smack dealer the crack dealer
I done sold drugs in every category
I swear you niggas bore me with your fucking stories
You fucking war in peace time with your fake ass glory
And your fake ass jewelry
Monkey ass jewelry
Couldn't find a million
With a road map and a bitch named Suri

I just copped a whole brick from papi
About to hit the stove get it popping
None of my niggas moving sloppy
Meet me on the ave nigga copy
Copy, copy, copy, copy
I'll be whipping hard
Till my wrist hurt
I'll be whipping hard
Till my wrist hurt
I'll be whipping hard

Four hoes on one strip copy?
Come press four zones into one brick copy?
I'll be copy cool, I might act a fool
Hop out the drop top yelling hallelujah
Boy I flow like a faucet
Had the shot and you lost it
Came in this bitch on some boss shit
But I roll out that coffin
That bitch we bone
On that bong we be coughing
So?
I've seen Javier on 45th
But I go together we throw the brick
Counted all the paper he told me copy?
These fuck boys are carbon copy

I just copped a whole brick from papi
About to hit the stove get it popping
None of my niggas moving sloppy
Meet me on the ave nigga copy
Copy, copy, copy, copy
I'll be whipping hard
Till my wrist hurt
I'll be whipping hard
Till my wrist hurt
I'll be whipping hard</pre>
