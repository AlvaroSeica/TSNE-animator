[Fat Joe]
Top of the world, we ain't gonna stop till you earl
got you sick when you heard the kid was rocking your girl
make you nauseus, glide through your block in twin porshes
of course is the ladies love joe cause he's gorgeous
recognize the king, the livest team
if I ever do time I prolly die in da bin
turn the one year stress 'til like 30 to life
Same day I came home I'll probabbly murder my wife
look at them guys, they all look shook and surprise
I dont know why I wrote the book on how to be live
when the shit goes down, be the last man standing
Can't beat them then join them, even though you can't stand them
It's the nigga that you love to hate
Ain't nothing change but the women and the living is great
Nowadays they got a pen and a K
I don't fly but keep a plane close by in case

[JuJu]
Yeah...Shit!
You know how we do
Capicu
Sent a few to ICU
The whole clique rock steady like Motley Crue
and ya'll shit starting to look sloppy too
Vamonos, them falling like dominos
Them Zanganos, Toca cantalo
I bang out with the classic rhyming flow
to lock it down "TOMA", where you trying to go
I'm dyin to grow
word let me speak my mind
cause see alot of your herbs thought I reached my prime
but I came in the game with a unique design
it's made up with only dope beats and rhymes
Puerto Rock, it this mic on or wut
so I can rep my peoples that's on the block
cognac on the rocks,haters want to know when it's goin to stop
till we on the top....What!

beat stops
Salsa beat starts
{people speaking spanish}

Regular beat starts
[Noreaga]
Ayyo...it go
Esta Loca, tony toca
we been boning bitches in they mothafucking chocha
this is the audience, I'm the lyricist
sucks how this suckers in the crowd want to hear this
???,???? and none of them in they case
I'm free as a bird and to fly out on stage
I'm not here for no frontin just to say a little something
this suckers don't like me cause I'm all about dumping
Shotgun pumping, ripping you up
I'm like Dru Hill now how I'm splitting you up
See I'm the founder god plus i'm half latino
See me in Miami eating fish wit my hijo
I'm chilling wit my uncle my fault I mean tio
Kidnap niggaz making them sniff a whole kilo
So what now, I heard you niggas want buck now
Caught you without a gun, you niggaz ain't tough now

[Tony Touch]
What's going on niggas? It's real
Fifty milimeter people need to guard ju neal
fuck you nigga how you feel
you fags are like Ally McBeal
snap you in half, what the fuck is the deal
junkyard aint no lyin to me, if you lie than you dyin with me
burning in hell, nigga frying with me
and I dont want nobody cryin for me
I want a thousand rounds in the air flying for me
Cah, Cah, Cah, Cah,Cah
so smell the gun powder
living in a place you couldnt get the fuck outta
The Horror, niggaz you know your whole life tryin to kill you
cant even control your own wife, keep movin
stayin in ground I ain't losing
Life is the deadly decision I keep choosing
Been like a battle out of hell
For every nigga sitting up in a cell
Keep it funky till we all outta jail</pre>
