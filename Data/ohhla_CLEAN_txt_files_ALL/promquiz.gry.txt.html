[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm Reason
I'm Recluse
He's Phantom
We're coming

Background vocals: 
She grew up too fast
Now she's a star

[Verse 1: Reason]
Her American Express card says Gothika
Wears some black lipstick on certain occasions
Take first place in a pageant like Jean Benet
Be found in the basement dead the next day
Choke her best friend with a Jawbreaker perhaps
A valedictorian shot gunning the Pabst
Take muscle relaxers so she can relax
Be a prom queen with a set of veins black

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Recluse]
I can't imagine a better place for Debbie
Sleeping at her wake so peacefully
Act twice her age relate with sex and amphetamines
Live the glamour life be treated like a beauty queen
Consume the world all at once just like she always dreamed
See the pyramids, experience ecstasy
Become a piece of meat inferior to Hennessey
Sell her body for money whenever hungry and cold
Take it all back to fifteen before she lost control

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Reason]
Little Miss Muffet
Get some implants cause natural won't cut it
Change her name to Wonderwoman, companion to me
Continue the drugs, mix the coke with the speed
Sleep with the teacher if it helps her get an A
Sleep with the preacher after confession forgave
Move to Hollywood the day after her graduation
Never be a virgin again out of frustration

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Recluse]
She wants a house on the hill with a spectacular view
An ounce of some pills and a bunny tattoo
Appeal to the masses, a Hollywood actress
A face made of plastic and voluptuous assets
Flirt with disease I'm concerned with HIV
Keep health and hygiene a secret from you and me
See her name and life behind a scene of fiends
She wants to be famous overnight but this her eulogy

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Reason]
Raggedy Ann
Give a disease to everybody that's her plan
Make up some stories to start gossip
Make up her face with the best makeup
Be the only women who really lived her life
Be the spokesperson for teenage suicide

[Recluse]
Beat herself up a bloody mess of molecules
Deal with the stress resolve the rest with sharp tools
Escape this place of all the misery and sorrow
Confront death, abandon the world and see tomorrow
Blame the world before she leaves to save face
Unaware that the life between the wait suffers the same face
