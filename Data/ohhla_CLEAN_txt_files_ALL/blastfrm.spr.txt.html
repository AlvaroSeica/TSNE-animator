VERSE 1

Model citizen, I've never even jaywalked
And if my job we're given 'em I'd never need a day off
And I don't have to dream of ever being paid more
My extra salary goes to charities I save for
Jump in my grey Ford and raise my thumb to the police squad
Make sure I come to a complete stop
Head to a sockhop, showing off my excellent foxtrot
I'm home before it's dark, and it's not locked
And Neighborhood Watch dropped in
As I caught Sullivan's show while puzzling over stock options
I'm patriotic, I even used to be an Eagle Scout
We put out a flag on both mine and my beagle's house
I like to read about politics and jesus now
God believes democracy and communism freaks me out
I scream, you scream everybody scream and shout
For nice, clean-cut America and being proud 

CHORUS

And my life's a 50's movie
Strangers waving to me
As if they knew me...yeah
I'm so liked that it's a doozy
But, hey, Cool Beans, I'm just groovy! 

VERSE 2

I was presented with the neighbour of the year award
And gave it to my favourite nominee I was cheering for
I'm well-adjusted and I always appear assured
Cuz I've got a healthy fear of war and the dear lord
I'm never near bored, I'm busy weeding my grass
I've done a year's chores and didn't see the time pass
I let my mind lapse, polishing a fine glass tabletop
Just in case my neighbors stop at my pad
I'd make a fine dad, pushing a baby carriage
Never had relations with a woman I'll wait for marriage
I make the average saint look like he's a vagrant from a savage place
When he gets compared to my mannered ways
I spend my Saturdays at the local Pantry line
Cheering up the folks, standing by with my pantomime
Must have touched them though, they way they wave their hands and cry
Not to brag or lie, but it's safe to say they're fans of mine 

CHORUS

And my life's a fifties movie
Strangers waving to me
As if they knew me...yeah
I'm so liked that it's a doozy
But, hey, Cool Beans, I'm just groovy! 
And my life's a fifties movie
Strangers waving to me
As if they knew me...yeah
I'm so liked that it's a doozy
But, hey, Cool Beans, I'm just groovy!</pre>
