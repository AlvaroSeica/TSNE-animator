*Super Cat intro*

[Super Cat]
Well I guess, soon as this apartment gon' flow
The killa boy boy, gonna flame gonna ride in west
And I gotta run up the mountain, and big up and test
But the pound that come with the stress
About to make me tell bout all of this
Gonna make sure got down the bulletproof vest
That me pop off and I splurge, anything me gon' test
Me say, me down down then done nigga rest

[Chorus: Super Cat]
Make me tell you bout scalp dem, scalp dem, and into their eye
Scalp dem, scalp dem, and into their eye
Scalp dem, scalp dem, and into their eye
Me gon' scalp dem, and into their eye

[Super Cat]
Indian, from our direction
Surrounded will eliminate to Grand Canyon
That's her, Cherokee and Chayan
Got to all lord radar, and Bounty Killer, yeah
And woman, not fitted quite Indian
Me take the money and the gold, and burn the young one
Rush a sand which, and he gwon leave one
And girl by me frame, we rush one by one
And they rest of them, me have me love attention
Tell them that Apache from the Western land

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
Yo, the kettle red hot, rude boy licking shots
In your area, mad man terror on your block
Ruckus, for the trouble, making gat busting, head touchers
Crooked train robbing gold rushers, nigga
It be the villain from the Ooh Building
That be, ready and willing for a want die killing
Murda, there ain't nothing in the world that I ain't heard of
Or did, just peep the hunger, pain from coming back, kid
Super Cat's sick, everything be cool irie
Pass the peace pipe like Chief Cocheese, yeah

[Chorus]

[Super Cat]
Oh boy a sound bwoy, a pretty boy get outside
But me shoot up by the sea, by the pressure we apply
My say shot up bald eagle, from out of the sky
Toss him, and then give up eye
Bring fire dance, and known the boy die
The woman, send on out and go cry
I witness star crushing years pon on the fly
We kill to outlaw and we still in July
We love the Eli, cuz Eli no he die
We let the Josie day long, the word don't work
We sign a treaty, a pity war signed to die
But if a boy sent to kill, answer fly

[Chorus]

[Super Cat]
Well I guess, soon as this apartment gon' flow
The killa boy boy, gonna flame gonna ride in west
And I gotta run up the mountain, and big up and test
But the pound that come with the stress
About to make me tell bout all of this
Gonna make sure got down the bulletproof vest
That me pop off and I splurge, anything me gon' test
Me say, me down down then done nigga rest

[Chorus]

[Super Cat]
Well I guess, soon as this apartment gon' flow
The killa boy boy, gonna flame gonna ride in west
And I gotta run up the mountain, and big up and test
But the pound that come with the stress
About to make me tell bout all of this
Gonna make sure got down the bulletproof vest
That me pop off and I splurge, anything me gon' test
Me say, me down down then done nigga rest
