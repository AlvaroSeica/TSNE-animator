Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Eye Candy]
Boy I can't take you home, it's straight to the room for me and you
You know how we do it, this freaky secret we pursue
You know your position, when we in those positions
Sometimes you have me wishing, but I won't fin start tripping
Or be messy with ya baby, mama when she call my cell phone
And when you see me on the streets, I keep it real freak
Find me slutty you calling, it's your lucky day cause I'm horny
Been a quite a while since we hooked up, we know we both need this
Look under booty call in my cell phone, you'll see your digits
Cause you handle your business, when you all up in it
In a lay one minute nigga squab with it, put me on my back then on my belly
Ooh baby I'm bout to get mine, it's right on time cause it's check out time

(*talking*)
Yeah, you know I can't take you home
I may stay up on game from the start, you know I'm saying
Peep game

[Magno]
I can't take you home, I gotta bail out after the first nut
It's the worst look, cause when I first stuck it in damn my phone's getting chirped up
Main gal getting worked up, getting served up so I'm missing calls
Clicking off think and pause, let me think of a lot while you lick my balls
I'm just playing ma, but on the real we fucking partnas
So you ain't gotta be faithful, go and fuck your partnas
Cause one hundred, is the only way I keep it
This is game you need to peep it, hey I'm your lil' secret
Like that song from Total on the mobile, I'm a lil' more known than local
Matter fact with this rap, I'm damn near global
So my bitch she be checking up, she be on her shit
I be fessing up I'm wrong and shit, you wet enough to be home for fish
Play your role and just hold it down, hold up she on the other line
Meet me at the spot say about nine, cool peace out

(*singing*)
Baby, just hit me on my celly
To let me know, just when you ready
You wanna roll with me, you wanna smoke with me
But by the end of the night, you know I'm gon hit it
Let me, lose control
After that, you could put it on cruise control
Baby bounce with it, I been down with it
See that pillow over there, go 'head and grip it
Baby, lose control
Maybe three, or four more
In the light and, in the dark
Baby spread your legs apart, oooh-oooh-ooooh-oooh

[Hook - 2x]
I can't take you home, I got a bitch that hold me down
(I can't take you home, my nigga does that all the time)
I can't take you home, shit I just got engaged
(I can't take you home, I guess we on the same page)</pre>
