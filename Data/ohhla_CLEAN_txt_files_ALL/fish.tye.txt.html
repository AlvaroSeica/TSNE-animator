[Tyler, the Creator]
Slip it in her drink; and in the blink
of an eye I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, cause last time I attempted this shit
the judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link, contended her to meet me
at the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fuckin and we only met last week
We're both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
you can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep that
neighbors by the creek say that my house stinks
and it wreaks of a chic girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
which makes meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie them and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go!
... Yeah, Wolf Gang ...

[Tyler, the Creator]
Bitches running 'round, down, pussy take a trip
Make you strip, got my dick harder than the unzipped
Tyler swift-ly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips poppin on that Canon, bustin odder mind cannons
On the pill, is he real? Gaza strip-ping
In my living room, Wolf Gang full moon
I'm assuming mushrooms, I'm a necro-lampoon
Not of Charles Mansoon, this fuck is end-ing soon
because I'm e-jac-u-lat-ing

[Frank Ocean]
Now I'd like to take this time of day to thank, the Mother Earth
Thank you mother, thank you momma
Letting the sun shine down on the lake while I fish the waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters
Hell hide grandmama too (graaaaaaand)
Cause the fisherman's rapin everybody in the pool
He on the loose, yeah

[Tyler, the Creator]
Got to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin bait
Wait until you see the semen swimmin baby
Please not half the hole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo
Going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can't get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets
You want me to eat you?
You're fuckin wet... fish </pre>
