Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Li-Mouse]
Hahaha, yeah, we're back, The Rodentz, muthafucka
Heh, that's what we do, this is how we roll, muthafucka
Yo, you ready, son? Yeah, I know
Straight up, yo

[Cno Evil]
I can spit fire on the track and make the beat hot
You heard the song was blazing so you burn yourself a cop'
The DJ thought it was ill, so he gave me a shot
I'm even sick on radio promos, they call 'em cough drops
Cno is your medicine, who let the menace in?
Censors with they hands ready, waiting for editing
Mix tracks like lettuce and, put it in a bowl
Lyrics flow like Wish-Bone (cuz that's how Rodentz roll)
I can very 'comical' with a 'marvelous' ego
The 'incredible', 'spectacular', 'fantastic' Mr. Cno
The 'daredevil' on any level, call me suicidal
I'm like the Ghost Rider on this music motorcycle
I make up my own title, I'm Interconti-Mental
Return to the essence like my presence is a rental
I think they sent you to take over our soul
But we just chillin' reading the scrolls (cuz that's how Rodentz roll)
Either we unappreciated, or the media's hating
Cuz I, look at the reviews and we're not even rated
But all those so called rappers, who say that they made it
Decreased in record sales, like haircuts that be faded
The paparazzi study the stars like Galileo
But I crush the hope like they was built from Lego's
I run through these tracks with the tempo of the Metro
Stay Grand like Central (cuz that's how Rodentz roll)
Extraordinary vision that's why they call me C
The 'No' part, is cuz of my remarkable memory
I had this red haired girl, cuz my 'sword' be 'heavenly'
With a case of Full Throttle to restore my energy
And an Amaretto bottle that'll last me an hour
She put the maraschino cherries inside with the sour
Right before she hit the shower, she dismantled her robe
That's how the story goes (cuz that's how Rodentz roll)

[Li-Mouse]
Aiyo my rocks stay frigid like I was in the arctic
Eskimos have trouble surviving when I start shit
Icicle spit, cats need to realize I'm nice, fam
Val Kil' 'em, you go batty, call me the Iceman
Top Gunnin' it, Rodentz start runnin' shit
Like gas prices, there's no way of stunnin' it
We keep pumpin' it, like Exxon and Mobil
Then laugh about it later, like we sitting in the oval
Office, I walk around town like shit's lawless
I combat mortals, my victories stay flawless
Call me Mario, I stay stomping a Goomba
Rodentz falling off? Nah, kid that's only a rumor
The way I make 'dreamworks', it leaves you 'antsy'
Ya'll Brady cats flow Patriot Games like Clancy
Fuck around, I'll leave you like whitey with no soul
So now you know, bitch, that (that's How Rodentz roll)
Viva La Vita, like the Packers I 'play cold'
Yo, this is poker, no chance, I may fold
On the table, periodically you say "AU" spit gold
I make cheese crazy, never turns to mold
Fuck around with Li, death is where you heading
I'm rap's eBay bitch, can the lyrical shredding
Cats like documents and old bank statements
Still got the flow on what New York State meant
You discover, exterminators couldn't trap Mouse
So you sit back and you'll let me run your house
Aiyo, this job is dirty, you can ask Mike Rowe
Rodentz colossal, ya'll MC's is just micro
Most of ya'll clowns never got the right flow
We all motor in this bitch, y'all need the nitro
N.O.S., ya'll calling out S.O.S.
So next time you wanna speak (that's how Rodentz roll)

[Chorus: Cno Evil]
We got the right beats, and we got the right rhymes
Just like the streets can't live without crimes
We fill up the sheets with those extravagant lines
The Rodentz elite up in these New York Times
Post up Daily, you didn't hear the News?
Straight outta White Plains, don't get it confused
So many punchlines, we leave the tracks bruised
That's how the Rodentz roll, your ears can't refuse

[Chorus: Li-Mouse]

[Outro: Li-Mouse]
