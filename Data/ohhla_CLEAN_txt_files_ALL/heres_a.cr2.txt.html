[Ese Daz]
Lil' Blue is in the casa
Ace, is in the casa
Cino
Is in the casa
Puttin' it down, for the raza
Yeah, it's Lil' Blue
With my homies in the house, with my familia
Ha ha, check it out

[Verse 1: Ese Daz]
Boom
Here comes another bomba
Lil' Blue with L.O.L., smoking out the mota
Trucha, when we roll through your fuckin' city
Better run and hide and make a phone call to the Fedi'
The juras, the blackas, that'll always harass the raza
I'm always on my toes, lookin' out for el ratas
On the freeway, doin' 95
Hit the 405 north to the Club Mile High
On the dance floor, sippin' zombies
With, three, four, five, freaks, freakin' on me
And jealous vatos get mad, cause they know I'm the man
Taking the hoes' home, havin' bubblebaths
Homie, don't playa-hate me
Congradulate me
I know it's hard cause I fucked your lady
So forget about the past and keep your eyes on the present
Lil' Blue is on the prowl, so lock your hoe in the basement

Chorus:
[Sample]  "Here's a little story, I got to tell
          About three bad brothers, you know so well" --&gt; Mike D. (Beastie Boys)
[Ese Daz] It goes one for the homies, two for the hoes
          Three for the Fedi, and four for 3-1-0

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
(Cino in background)
[Ace]     Come along, hurry hurry
          Before the show begins
          Jump in the ride with three loco Mexicans
          Got a bottle of gin, with a pocket full of Ben's
          Headed up the hill, to the spot, Coaquin
[Cino]    Flossin' in the club, see the ladies in the crap
          I walk up to one, I said
          "I can make ya bounce"
          She said, "I don't do it enough"
          I do it in the Coup
          So I freak the honies, then I call in the truce
[Ace]     Come on, come all (It's on)
          Freak til ya fall
[Cino]    Got the pannies drippin' wet
[Both]    And I'm killing you soft
[Ace]     So rough, so tough, but you not, getting enough
[Cino]    Double A is some trouble
[Both]    When Triple A is too much
[Cino]    Who want to run with the L.O.L. and the Lil' Blue
[Both]    The truce
[Cino]    From this
[Ace]     Loco Latin groove
[Cino]    How and where it all began, you'll never even know
[Ace]     Lil' Blue, put it down
[Ese Daz] H.A., 3-1-0

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Ese Daz (Ace in background)]
Now you know, homies, my clique is the shit
Mafiosos Arellanos making dead presidents
It's a Familia here, so ain't no set trippin'
Got each other's back for life
Motherfucker, til we die
It's a loco Latin thing
Where we swang
C-Arson City, rest in peace to Lil' Pee Wee
A little shoutout to my homie
Keep your memory alive, pour some here out a 40 
And roll out in my '79 glass house
Got some bitches waiting for me out my nephew Ace's house (Yeah)
Everybody's partyin' down, hoochies looking good
With little shorts on, dancin', drinkin', booze gone
And everything is going right tonight
It's already one o'clock and ain't no cops in sight
So it's on (It's on)
So hit the bong (Bring it on)
And listen to the hook as the historia goes on

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Sample in background)
[Ese Daz] Yeah ("Here's a little story, I got to tell")
          Yeah
          Yeah ("About three bad brothers, you know so well")
          Check it out, y'all
          Check it out, y'all
          (???), gettin' fucked up ("Here's a little story, I got to tell")
          Ain't that right, Ace? ("About three bad brothers, you know so well")
[Ace]     Straight poppin', homie
[Ese Daz] Man, C-No hittin' the bong
          Fuck, man
          Slow down
          And we outta here
          Harbor Area for life ("Here's a little story, I got to tell")</pre>
