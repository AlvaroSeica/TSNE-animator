[Mr. Shadow]
{*laughing*}
It don't stop
{*medallion rattling*}
Yeah
I make you bounce, rock
Skate, roll (Roll...)
I make you bounce, rock
Skate, roll (Roll...)
I make you bounce, rock
Skate, roll (Roll...)
Yeah
Check this shit out (Check it out)
No
Bull, shit

(Verse 1)
Hold up, wait a minute (Why)
Shadow back up in it (Damn)
Two, K, two, all in blue, I won't quit it
Bring it on
There's a rumor going 'round
How I show old dogs new tricks, they bow down (Woof)
You ain't safe or sound
Clown, I'm the subliminal
Stalker of the night
Smoking hazardous chemicals {*inhale*}
Hypocritical pricks ain't allowed
There's a bunch of you flees mixed in with the crowd
Mr. Rowdy Rod Looter
Snitch executor
Assault rifle shooter (Pow!)
Still dodgin' judas (Whoo!)
I'm watchin'
Every move you make
I got something to prove and somebody's place to take
It's too late, the whole game about to get rearranged
They all want the name, but none of them want to pay shit
I stay patient
Laughin' at you assholes
Don't make turn your whole click into examples

Chorus: Mr. Shadow
I make you bounce, rock
Skate, roll
Straight from C-A, who wanna stay, who wanna roll {*E-Dubb scratching*}
I got control, the whole game's on lock
I keep it hot from my hood to your block

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
So you thought I was done (What)
Not close
You some dumb young fucks
You get exposed
I'm out of control
Time for you to know
Who really got this game in the motherfucking choke hold
Shadow loco, dippin' in your county
I wish you can see how your hoe acts around me (Shadow)
Lousy ass mutts with no nuts
Who you foolin'
Your ass'll get harassed, we stay dashin' and movin'
Ask any human who's runnin' the show
For them fools locked up good, puttin' they life in hold
From the youngest to the oldest (Oldest)
Hottest to the coldest (Coldest)
I'm the sickest, and you know this
I'm a blow this bitch out the water
Rookie ass fool, keep your motherfuckin' guard up
Start up your ride
And feel what I left ya
BOOM!
You son of a bitch
Meet your maker

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 3)
Bitch
I don't know what the fuck you been sniffin' {*sniff*}
Fools like myself ain't around where you livin' (No)
Listen to the words of the M, R (M, R)
West coast, south side, homeboy, we stay hard
From the womb to the boneyard
It don't change
I let my nuts hang
We ain't on the same page
I flip the script like only I can (I can)
Smash your style like an aluminum can
Brown skin, shaved head and a clip full of lead (Full of lead)
I'll turn your couch into your motherfuckin' death bed (Pow!)
Not to be tested, young peasents learn a lesson
In the land of the sick
You can all suck dick
Ha
Tuck your chain
Hide your rings
When you slip on these streets, you're leaving everythang
Get your bang on (Bang on)
Whatever corner that you hang on
Or be a goner, wannabe, you won't last long

Repeat Chorus Twice

[E-Dubb]
{*scratching*}
"Mr. Shadow from San Diego
Killa-fornia
Makin' you bounce to this..."
{*scratching*}
"Mr. Shadow from San Diego
Killa-fornia
Makin' you bounce to this..." --&gt; Mr. Shadow
