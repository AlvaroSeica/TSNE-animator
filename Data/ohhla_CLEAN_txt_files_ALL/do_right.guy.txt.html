Do Me Right
(Heavy D)
Ayo Teddy you ready
(Teddy) Yep Yep
Ayo nasty man your ready
(Aaron) Oohhh yeaha
What about you crazy legs?
(Damion) You know I'm steppin
Well yo let put this together and let all the
girls know how we wanna be done

(Heavy D)
Now would you mind if I laid you down and
licked you lovely
Made your body sticky with some bumble bee honey
And tickled your fancy with my finger or a feather?
Worry not, my lover
The Heavster is clever
Now I'd like to hold you and squeeze you tight
But don't turn into an acrobat and flip over night
'Cause we can go on if the lovin is strong
But I'd really hate to have to write a do me wrong song

Do Me Right (Repeat 4X)

(Aaron Hall)
I dream of you all the time
when I wake up there's a smile on my face
and when we get together
Girl I just don't know what to say
why is it hello kiss goodbye
really making me feel low
can you tell me what is on your mind
I just got to know
What is goin on?
can you tell me where do we go from here?
Wanna bring you close bring you in my heart
I wanna know that you're my girl
but girl you gotta treat me right

(Chorus #1 Background Vocals)
Do me right
I just wanna be your man
I want you be my girl
why don't you just
do me right?

(Chorus #1 Aaron)
Do me right, I wanna be your man
Bring you close to me
Why don't you do me, do me right?
Girl ya know, girl ya know, I wanna be your man

(Aaron Hall)
Such a sticky situation
But I think that we should take that chance
So many plans we've got ahead
Let's forget about the past
We can get to making love and romance
Girl you're something else
I wanna get with you, believe me girl
I wanna hold you close
Keep you in my heart
I gotta know that you're my girl
Girl, you gotta treat me right

(Repeat Chorus #1 Background Vocals 2x)

(Chorus #2 Aaron)
Oh yeah yeah
Be my girl, oh-oh
Why don't you do me, do me right?
Girl ya know, girl ya know..

(Random Girl :Who's on the phone)

(Heavy D)
Well it's caller number one
What's the matter?
Don't you recognize my voice, honey bun?
Oh, I understand
You were half sleep
Now wait a minute-
Who's beeper just beeped?
I know it ain't mine
Mine's is on my hip
Now tell me you didn't flip
On the honey dipped ya pocket trip
It's time to get ya heart broke
Honey, I smell smoke
You thought he was dope so you took a toke?
So here's the news, I'm ghost
I'm outta here, long gone
The lover went left
So honey you stay strong;
And when you wake up in the middle of the night
I'll be with her 'cause she
She'll do me right!
Do me right

(Bridge Background Vocals)
Do me right
Be my girl

(Repeat Chorus #1 Background Vocals 2x)

(Chorus #3 Aaron)
Do me right!
Ho-oh, yeah baby
Promise I will do the right things for you
Please baby, be my girl
I don't want nobody else
Oh I've got to have your love right now
Oh do me right
Do me right now baby
I can't wait no longer
Ho-oh-oh, do me right, baby, oh-oh-oh....</pre>
