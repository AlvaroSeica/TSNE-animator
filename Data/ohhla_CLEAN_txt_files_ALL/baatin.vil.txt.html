Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

My auntie, she invited me to a potluck
She wanted me to meet a young buck
But it gotta be, defined, if I'm all 'round some swine
Smellin that shit, watchin weak niggaz jet
Now they lookin at me, sayin who is this nigga
If I went and bust my shit they'd be all in my face
Talkin my nigga you play a lot, stick to hip-hop
But I've been where you at, bustin and fadin the team hat
Sellin my smack, and nigga you don't know times
I've been {?}, with a big ass back
I know you worried about me, I'm with that crew S.V.
My name is Baatin, ras who I see
You wanna get buck buck, niggaz like you get fold up
I know I'm older when I'm lookin over your shoulder
You hoe, I'm the one that sold you the ki of brown boulder
Hold up, hold up~!
I think I'm now ready, just to rock cold steady
Wit'cha girl from on the block, cause she all on the jock
And if your girl is on my jock, she gonna get her yoni knocked up
Hold up, hold up
