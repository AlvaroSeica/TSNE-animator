Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I cant say that I know just what you're dealing with
But it's so plain that it shows just what your feelings is
But I suppose that your pain that you're living with
It comes and goes and fills your mind now with hopelessness
But I know someone who comes with life to give
And His love is the reason why my life can live
Just one touch is all you're needing
'Cause He died to give you so much but you can't see 'cause you
Struggle with
So many things up in your life you're frustrated with
Nothing seems to be going right I know you're hating it
But let me tell you see I've been through what you experienced
And I've come to see the source of who my healing is
If it's divorce or anything else making it hard to live
I gotta tell you you can make it just through all of this
'Cause everywhere you go He's there for you it's obvious
Don't be scared no more cause this is why I'm saying this

[CHORUS]
Everywhere I go I know you're not far away
You're right here, you're right here, yeah
Everywhere I go I know you're not far away
You're right here, you're right here, yeah

I remember times when I couldn't find my peace of mind
When I felt I couldn't see now cuz I was blind
All the time You was there and then You freed my eyes
Made me realize that You was all I need in life
From the deepest oceans all the way up to the skies
There is no place were I could go and no place to hide
That your hands wouldnt show the way and be my guide
You're never far away You'll always be my peace in life

Everywhere I go I know you're not far away
You're right here, you're right here, yeah
Everywhere I go I know you're not far away
You're right here, you're right here, yeah

So right now just with anything you face in life
Understand you can always find strength in Christ
God has a plan just for every single part of your lives
That might be hard to understand in your troubled times
But anywere you go He's there with arms open wide
He cares for you don't you know there's no need to cry
I know this road is hard c'mon it's gonna be alright
He loves you so much it's time that you realize....

Everywhere I go I know you're not far away
You're right here, you're right here, yeah
Everywhere I go I know you're not far away
You're right here, you're right here, yeah</pre>
