[First Verse]
Never try me like a thug
If you do you betta duck
I'ma hit him in his body somebody patching him up
I'ma bust a nigga head somebody rapping him up
When I ask you for my shit nigga am I askin too much?
Ridin dirty in my seven duece
Its dirty you tell the truth
I'm dirtier than a reverend Fighting Bitch I the revenue
I'ma get mine you can call me uncle Sam
Use you for your services than I don't give a damn
Slap Bush Wit my cash all these taxes and his gas
Got these bitches sellin ass Homicide for tha cash
Homicide for tha cash ride around gunnin mass
Summer time Son of Sam Triple C's gon gun you down
Twenty birds I'ma serve posted up on this curb
Got alot of pistol game so we at cha everyday
If you owe me a dime boy you betta give me mine
Cause I'm pullin my nine wit one thing thats on my mind

[Chorus]

[Sencond Verse]
Still waitin on the call homie pose to be my dawg
It don't been more than a week he caught himself runnin off
Yea he bought two Two's but I fronted anotha three (three)
But I'ma get him marked off for no less than a quarter key
Yea I broke him off now I gotta break him off (off)
He think he using his head I gotta take it off (off)
That boy loosing his head then I'm takin off (off)
Mashing in the grand national won't break it off (off)
Let me break it down (down)

Bad little bitches shakin it when they break it down (down)
Let me break it down I Broke it down to the smallest slab (slab)
Cause I'm so fat (fat)got the fiends callin cabs (cabs)
I'm out here for my stacks (stacks)
I'm out here for my stacks (stacks)

Three in the mornin and you know why they knockin for (Ross)

[Chorus]

[Third verse]
I'm like a professor I wait and I measure Triple beam on the dresser
Couldn't be fresher cookin is my pleasure cookies is my treasure
Hustle couldn't be better muscle you couldn't measure
Nigga's feelin the pressure pressure they bust pipes
I'm cool wit your bitch your bitch fuck nice (see I need that)
Fly hoes on my team (see I need that)my hoes will gimmie anything
Grindin back in savanna climbing back through Atlanta
Shoot the makin see whats shakin my shit white as miss vanna
It's Rick Ross Rolls-Royce when I floss (floss)
I'ma big boss and I never took a loss (see I need that) (see I need that)
I might of took a loss but it wasn't like that (Ross)
So I'm back on my grizzle (grizzle) got the streets on sizzle (sizzle)
It's Ricky Rizzle the rich nizzle the rich nizzle now bitch
