Song:   Michael Jackson Is Dead
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

"Oh my God, did you hear about Michael Jackson?"
"Yeah, I heard about Michael Jackson. It's crazy, right?"
"Yeah, I can't believe it. All of a sudden the media's on his side."
"I know, it's crazy, right?"

Michael Jackson is dead
Don't pretend you give a shit
You motherfuckin' hypocrites
Remember what you said he did
Michael Jackson is dead
No, you never gave a shit
So why are you pretendin'
You motherfuckin' hypocrites?

"Michael Jackson's such a freak"
You'd hear it a thousand times a week
On every fuckin' TV screen
And every fuckin' magazine
Yeah sure we liked him for a while
For a few years when he was in style
Then someone said he's a pedophile
And fuckin' boys is what makes him smile
Then there was a punchline every day
About his Skeletor-like face
And how he loved twelve year old balls
We didn't care if it was true or false
So don't pretend that you give a fuck
Keep talkin' 'bout how he sucked twelve year old cock
And went from being a cute little black kid
And died as a white skeleton robot

Michael Jackson is dead
Don't pretend you give a shit
You motherfuckin' hypocrites
Remember what you said he did
Michael Jackson is dead
No, you never gave a shit
So why are you pretendin'
You motherfuckin' hypocrites?

Remember when he dangled his kid from a balcony?
I wasn't hearing you call him legendary
And when we heard that shit about the Culkin kid
We said "Oh my God, Jacko's motherfuckin' sick!
He likes fucking kids! He likes fucking kids!"
Nobody was talkin' 'bout his music
Now if I say he died chokin' on a kid's dick
You say "Oh my God, that's so offensive!"
Well fuck you you motherfucking cunt-ass bitch
Everyone in the news you hear from motherfucking cribs
On your high horse sayin' that I'm a demon
Cuz I say he overdosed on a boy's semen

Michael Jackson is dead
Don't pretend you give a shit
You motherfuckin' hypocrites
Remember what you said he did
Michael Jackson is dead
No, you never gave a shit
So why are you pretendin'
You motherfuckin' hypocrites?

"Oh, it's so sad that Michael passed away,
We loved him so much."
Really? Really, did you love him?
Cuz from where I'm standing it kinda looked like you hated him
And that you called him a freak and that you wanted him to die
But now that he's dead, you love him
And he's a legend and he's so amazing
And "We love Michael Jackson!"
How about you go fuck yourself you big bunch of fuckin' hypocrites?
Here, I'm going to do this for you
I'm going to do this for you

Billie Jean was not his lover
Of course she wasn't, she had a vagina
And she was older than twelve years old

Fuck you, hypocrites</pre>
