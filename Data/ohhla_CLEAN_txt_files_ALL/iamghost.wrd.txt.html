[Sample]
None of this is real
You pull the plug I disappear
And nothing I ever say
Nothing I ever do
Will ever matter

[Werd]
Its like I'm a Ghost
Your are Ghost
Were all Ghost
Were all just Ghost
Im a Ghost
Your are Ghost
Were all Ghost
Were all just Ghost

[Werd]
I am Ghost (Ghost)
Lost in a daze
Stuck in a shell my own hell I have made
Back in the Shade the dark the grey
But never been scared of the noise of the stage
Like boo you boo
Fuck You I'm a loose it
Just like my mind when I rhyme and I do this
Yes I take rap and abuse it
People say to me
'God Why are You doing this?'
Well I'm in a scene no seen where it seems
I am seen as a figment of dreams
Symbol of needs and not what we wanted
Stay in the dark in the city most haunted
Alude Reekie its the city most haunted
But not being seen is not what we wanted
And some dont believe me
I am Ghost but I want you to see me

[Werd]
Its like I'm a Ghost
Your are Ghost
Were all Ghost
Were all just Ghost
Ghost [x3]

[Riddlah]
Ha its the Riddlah
Dont even realize it
Were all ghost
You think we exist?

Im a ghost like I'm not even here
Not even real so why would you care
The problem is I put as much work in 
As an English or American 
But when its all done 
I dont get nothing at the end of it
Youve got to live what your doing to keep on moving
Cause people are looking in your direction acting clueless
The truth is I think your ready for the sound now
So gather round now and watch all the ghost all come out now
I found out 
Im not alone in my quest
From coast to border boarder to coast 
But no ones getting ahead
Still I give it my best and a'l be standing till the end
Waving my Scottish flag with thirty of my friends
And even though we are nameless it unfolds
You run home scared of the ghost of the unknown
So take a peek into the life of my people
Lost in an industry thats corrupt and evil
Cause I'm a...

[Werd]
Ghost
Your are Ghost
Were all Ghost
Were all just Ghost
Im a Ghost
Your are Ghost
Were all Ghost
Were all just Ghost

[Deeko]
I spit my verses through telekinesis
My poems are potent a street genius 
Who speeches will leave you speechless
I exercised your mind
My presence will seep so fucking deep 
That even palm readers cant reach us
Put my life into sheets so you fuckers better believe in me
My voice is heard but youll never get to my frequency
Send a message through speakers and hope that hear
So know that I'm there my vocals will float in the air
Dont go unprepared
But there isnt much you can do
If you think it will never happen next I'm coming for you
You running from who 
You cant you will never escape
I plan to murder everyone who ever said I was fake
Like CB4 but you dont want to see Deek fall
To another place I might act up like a Weegie Board
You might retaliate but I know thats only a treat
Cause you cant kill whats already dead
People know that I'm a


[Werd]
Ghost
Your are Ghost
Were all Ghost
Were all just Ghost
Im a Ghost
Your are Ghost
Were all Ghost
Were all just Ghost

There are of coarse those who do not want us to speak [x3]</pre>
