Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Make it bounce

I don't wanna hurt you
But I'm bout to work, watch you mouth drop real low
I'm turning you up, burning the club
Full speed, both feet to the floor, feet to the floor
DJ running the bet once more, time to party
That's all I know
Grab somebody, tell them baby baby baby let's go

Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it, bounce!
Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it, bounce!

Oh oh oh oh oh

Make it bounce

Leggy Iggy getting them tipsy
Tipping them bro, tell them 50s
Pulling them masks, black card, getting on everyone, tipping whatever we feeling
We real good, hands to the ceiling
Haste we dizzy, we spin spin
All about money, the nice never ending
We party til morning, tomorrow we kick it

Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it, bounce!
Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it, bounce!

Oh oh oh oh oh

Make it bounce

Bet you her down, and shake it
Shake it shake it
Twerk it out,
Dizzy spin, watching my hips

Round round
Shake it, break it, make it, bounce!
It's a celebration
Go go go
Girl shake that thing like you made it
Low low low
Then show the good life you wasting
Pow pow pow
And raid the crowd with amazement
For sure sure sure

Make it bounce
Make it bounce
Make it bounce

Oh oh oh oh oh

Shake it, break it, make it, bounce!</pre>
