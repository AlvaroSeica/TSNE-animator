Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[John Mayer]
I'm riding in truth
Catch you up on places I, ve been

[W.A.L.E.]
To whom it may concern
I refuse to never being on this earth
I am breathing for a purpose
I want to be the centerpiece of my entire culture
And I, ve been thinking about you

Cause you, ve done such, by doing such
I get a pen a paper, write you a letter
Cause you are appriciated, I'm dreamin to be great
While working on my mistakes, You promised that's changed
I'm doing the same thing

Dear Mr. Obama I'm hoping this letter reaches you in good spirits
Lord knows you, ve been busy, but I just wanna know
I I speak could you listen, we live in the same city
I was hoping I could to visit ya
If not, I'm hoping this letter could convey how I'm feeling
An you could find interest

First off congratulations on your win
It's time for some change to commence
I got a question for you mayor
From an african american stance
Are we expecting too much from your four year plan

And what about the rappers that happen to act
Like a black president gives us the right to be assholes
You know they say your name for attention
But little to no interest after election

Or the too cheap t-shirt sellers
Are making revenue off a name we cherish
As I end this letter, one more thing
I hope you understand your impact on our race
Sincerely Wale, PSA
I ain, t trying to nit pick but you can stick the rest of the way

[John Mayer]
I'm riding in truth
Catch you up on places I, ve been
You have this letter probably got excited
But there's nothin that's inside

[W.A.L.E.]
To whom it may concern
I refuse to never being on this earth
I am breathing for a purpose
I want to be the centerpiece of my entire culture
And I, ve been thinking about you

Cause you, ve done such, by doing such
I get a pen a paper, write you a letter
Cause you are appriciated, Like Dear Mama
The reason I work hard, like even my favorite rapper, he was bigger than a artist

Dear Pac I was 12 when they gunned you
Wish you was around now to see what I, ve become
You, ve never had a son in the physical or literal
But years later there are still a bunch of little yous

Never seen you was lyrical, But more or less the voice that the whole culture listens too
Speaking the truth like only you can do
It's only right we lose greatness at it's pinacle
I got a question for ya, Are still mad at biggie, are you still mad dre
And are you happy with the way your legacy portrayed
I'm trying to do for D.C. what you did for L.A

But music today is getting lame for us
They chasing fame rather than making a change for us
They stop being honest, they stop being honest
They want their club shit, ain't no more dear mamas
And you don, t know me, but knowing you through music
Is going to change the world in the future, truly
Yours Wale, PSA, how long will they mourn you forever in a day

[John Mayer]
I'm riding in truth
Catch you up on places I, ve been
You have this letter probably got excited
But there's nothin that's inside

[Wale]
So I'm writing you this letter
I can only hope you read it if you get it
Hoping if you get it, you will never forget it
You will never forget it, You will never forget it

So I'm writing you this letter
I can only hope you read it if you get it
Hoping if you get it, you will never forget it
You will never forget it, You will never forget it

[John Mayer]
I'm riding in truth
Catch you up on places I, ve been
You have this letter, probably got excited
But there's nothin that's inside it

I'm riding in truth
Catch you up on places I, ve been
You have this letter, probably got excited
But there's nothin that's inside it</pre>
