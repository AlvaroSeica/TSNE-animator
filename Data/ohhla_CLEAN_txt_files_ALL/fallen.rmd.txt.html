[Movie Sample] 
It's been in the seventies 
Matters and reports on the streets 
That new laws are needed at every level 
But war alone cannot make men see right 
We are confronted primarily with a moral issue 
But part of the question is whether all Americans 
are to be alloted equal rights and equal oppurtunities 
Whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated 

[Intro: Remedy] 
Dedicated, I came with the offerin 
You know who it's for 

[Chorus: Remedy] 
For the +Fake MC's+ that swear they can rap 
For all those cats that love to talk yak 
For all those white kids who wanna be black 
Yo love is still love y'all +I Gotcha Back+ 

[Remedy] 
This is Remedy, remote mind devices, my advice is priceless 
The Devil got you chained in vices, the crisis 
Will surface, your purpose is worthless 
Attack on ya nervous, frontal lobe +Short Circuits+ 
The choices, the unheard voices 
Comin from inside ya head, internally bled, red 
Mislead and mentally dead, walkin 
You said what you said, yo you was born to be talkin 
I know about ya kind, ya state and frame of mind 
Weakened deaf, dumb and blinds, you look but never find 
The evil that men do, yo Satan is in you 
The tempter of man, release the negative if you plan to continue 
Your ways and actions, reactions, thought processin patterns 
Not logical, can't defeat the obstical 
Understand, +I Ain't Mad at 'Cha+ 
Got to do what I can, throw my pen and my pad at ya 

[Chorus] 

[Chorus 2: Remedy] 
To my hustlers on the corner, sell ya blow and ya crack 
For the so-called Gods livin right and exact 
Yo, positive and negative, opposites attract 
Love is still love y'all +I Gotcha Back+ 

[Hook: Remedy] 
I be the Sun and the rain, the +Pleasure and Pain+ 
The light inside the dark, I could never explain 
I be the Sun and the rain, the +Pleasure and Pain+ 
The light inside the dark, I could never explain 

[Remedy] 
Fallen Angels are cast out of Heaven until 
Created good became evil on ya own free will 
No more, never taught, uncontrollable thought 
Keep comin up short, happines cannot be bought 
Remedy Ross, great centrifrical force 
You'll never learn, born to burn, in the fire 
Take my kindness for weakness, humble and meakness 
Those who speak don't know so I stay speechless 
Any man disrespects deserves and gets what he gets 
The most merciful forgives but he never forgets 
Yo I don't need no friends, loose ends turned enemy 
I weed out the fake, yes through process I Remedy 
Eventually ya physcially trapped and strapped mentally 
Love is still love though, +Death Be the Penalty+ 

[Chorus] 
[Chorus 2] 

[Remedy] 
Heavenly grounded with no plans of fallin 
+Never Again+, +Never Again+, that's my callin 
No time for stallin, jet pack, acrobat raps, Venus fly traps 
Buy that, base snare, kickin a high hat 
Warfare apparell, in my path walk narrow 
A buck-seventy-five pounds raw, laser arrow 
Seal team six, always speak with our hands 
Disrupts plans and carry out commands 
Want to dance with the spoken word and holy tongue? 
The Unsung Heroes of the Shaolin slums 
Heavens to mercy, lightning shall strike those who curse me 
Do not say thy name in vain, analyze the wise, it's the guides 
False tense and pretense, offense and defense 
The lead current sequence 

[Chorus] 
[Chorus 2] 

[Movie Sample] 
The great kings have a task, and our task 
Our obligation is to make that revolution, that change 
Peaceful and constructive to all 
Those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence 
Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality </pre>
