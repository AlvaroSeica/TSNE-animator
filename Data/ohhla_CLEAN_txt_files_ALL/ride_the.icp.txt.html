Typed by: krazy_doggz@hotmail.com

step forth and face the beast that is the mighty tempest!
dare to go for a spin on the world's most horrifically fabulous ride!
behold the tempest!  the fastest, highest, steepest, and tallest
coaster-ride ever to exist on this or any other planet!

We fuckin rollin with no controllin, them bolts ain't holdin
take you higher, rollin' on wires, till time expires
swinging corners, so kids are goners, you hangin' on-ers
duck them tunnels, they shrink like funnels..
get your forehead pummeled
We upside down you, then around and around you, your evil found you
let's go faster, it's sheer disaster, while spinnin' backwards
jagged edges, no kind of ledges, with broken wedges
It's the largest, fastest, steepest, deepest, tallest, all this, and more roller coaster

[Chorus]
It's something thrilling for you, so get on, get on it (come on the tempest)
You got that feelin' in you, so jump up, jump on it (jump on it)
It's something wicked for you so get on, get on it (let's ride the tempest)
We got that ticket for you, so jump up, jump on it

electrifyin' and now you climbin, feels like you flyin
The carts are shakin, slowly elevatin, sound like they breakin
rickety, rackety, clickity, clack, up we go, you no look back
some french guy had to look, froze up and fell out, he got so shook
so fuck him, them polls keep duckin, this cart you stuck in
upward spiral, the rings of fire, still climbing higher
rackety, rickity, clackity, click, now you on the tip-top tipity tip
tip of the largest, fastest, steepest, deepest, tallest, all this, and more roller coaster

[Chorus]
It's something thrilling for you, so get on, get on it (come on the tempest)
You got that feelin' in you, so jump up, jump on it (jump on it)
It's something wicked for you so get on, get on it (let's ride the tempest)
We got that ticket for you, so jump up, jump on it

straight down, you fallin, you fallin
straight down so fast your skin is crawlin
straight down, you fallin, you fallin
straight down so fast your skin is crawlin
You fallin so fast, you see your whole life flash
your balls jump up your ass in a quick dash
You get whiplash, the shit fast on your bitch ass
and it don't stop till the shit crash

[Chorus] - 2X
It's something thrilling for you, so get on, get on it (come on the tempest)
You got that feelin' in you, so jump up, jump on it (jump on it)
It's something wicked for you so get on, get on it (let's ride the tempest)
We got that ticket for you, so jump up, jump on it</pre>
