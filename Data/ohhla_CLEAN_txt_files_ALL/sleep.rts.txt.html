[Aaron Livingston]
Like when autumn leaves fall, down from the trees
There goes my honey bee
I've lost a lot of, sleep to dreams...
(And I do not miss them yet!)
(I wouldn't wish them on the worst of enemies)
Let them burn, go from here...
..like when autumn leaves
 
[Black Thought]
To catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep
Insomniac, bad dreams got me losin sleep
I'm dead tired, my mind playin tricks, deceit
A face in the glass, unable to admit defeat
All that I am all that I was is history
The past unraveled addin, insult to this injury
I'm, fightin the battle for the soul of the century
Destiny is everything that I pretend to be
Look, and what I did came back to me eventually
The music, played on and told me I was meant to be awake
It's unresolved like everything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened oncidentally
Oh.. there I go from a man to memory
Damn, I wonder if my fam will remember me
