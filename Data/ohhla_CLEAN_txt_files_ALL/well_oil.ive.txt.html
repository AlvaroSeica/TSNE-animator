[Verse 1]
Just buy into it and you will prosper
These super charged living rates of today have exceeded past the point of 
prior expectations
That any mortal coil could fathom or even possibly hope to imagine that we would
see all this in our life time, it's all there at the flick of a wrist
Wade in a hyper colour pool of selection , healthy choice is a bed ridden state
with so many options oozing from the walls around to intake
Try comprehend the variety spread caked across jittering shutter speed 
through a haze of pretty crystal shards, smoke and rapid ageing

[Chorus]
It's the well oiled machine that will take you places
It's the well oiled machine that will take you places where you wanna go
It's the well oiled machine that will take you places
It's the well oiled machine

[Verse 2]
Up the milligrams again, see that's half the fun not knowing when it will stop
Its got to end eventually so supress the vertigo
Look for the seal of approval if it's clinically proven
then surely it's worth forking out the extra doe for, just remember less is more
It's the new slim line version - yes it comes in a can now
Rewind live television to re-live ad breaks, I'll take three
Necessary to force feed me all this other shit that I don't need
so send it all to my modern furnished coffin suspended up in the breeze

[Chorus]
It's the well oiled machine that will take you places
It's the well oiled machine that will take you places where you wanna go
It's the well oiled machine that will take you places
It's the well oiled machine

[Verse 3]
Keep gorging on the water rations, supplies are not limited
Nor do the erratic climate patterns reflect at all on our life style
So rest easy population drowning in blood from holes in his feet
for our own little war pigs empty promises seem to be satisfying
Throw bundles at nothing, straight to the furnace
Funds are secure, build a new base
Let's utilize all of this empty space, anything to be part of the team
While hot the gun metal grey panels expand and breathe
With no dead man device the axels grind running on hell fire steam

[Chorus]
It's the well oiled machine that will take you places
It's the well oiled machine that will take you places where you wanna go
It's the well oiled machine that will take you places
It's the well oiled machine</pre>
