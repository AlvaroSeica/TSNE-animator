Album:  Heavy Metal Kings
Song:   Eye Is the King
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Ill Bill]
My fist is a gun, my fingers is individual pistols
System overload, glitches toe to toe, eye to eye, soul to soul
Walk amongst the lords of war, swords of gore
Cause these invisible walls to fall
Mental slavery, skids a metal prison corridor, cult leader orator
Since I was a shorty y'all, busy with the .44
The black flag represent the skull and the guns
It's like sellin a Mac-11 to Attila the Hun
The ultimate in cult leaders, adult folk villains
Coke dealings in the champagne room, with broke feelings
So fake amongst plastic piranhas
I'ma put you all to sleep in some acid pajamas
Central Intelligence odyssey, mind control biography
MK Ultra, extraterrestrial sodomy
Way beyond astronomy, double-oh like Sean Connery
We walk silently with big silencers violently

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Everything William Cooper was talking about then is happenin now
Malachi York was way ahead of his time too it's wild
{"In the land of the blind the man with one eye is the king" - Nas}

[Vinnie Paz]
My fist is a gun, every finger's an individual sword
You either livin with Shaitan or you livin with God
I make metal with the cult leader orator
Since I was shorty y'all busy with Bacardi raw
I cock the .44, symphonies by Marley Marl
I would splatter all of y'all, shit y'all never saw before
Vinnie and his dogs of war, bombs the size of soccer balls
Since y'all was inside the walls, tortured with the waterboards
Grab him by his throat, take his fuckin head and scalp him
I carry black metal like I'm Venom's second album
Support Dr. York, don't believe what's said about him
Strangle non-believers 'til the fuckin redness out 'em
If we don't like what they sayin I guess we have to drown 'em
All they see is the demon lord and death around 'em
I'm made of mercury alloy like I was an amalgam
No matter how you look at it cousin death is the outcome

[Chorus]
