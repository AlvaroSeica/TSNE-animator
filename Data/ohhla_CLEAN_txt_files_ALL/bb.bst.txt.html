[Intro]
Ahhhhh B-E-A-S-T-I-E GO!

[Verse One]
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
That's just what Beastie's gotta be
Can't you see this is an emergency?
Can you feel the urgency?
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
With the whole of democracy
in a state of emergency now

[Verse Two]
Ahhhhh go to hell let me rock the state
I'm coming off as section eight
All cross the stormy sea
Better days in democracy
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
Cutting this thing off so merrily
We're in a state of emergency now

[Verse Three]
Ahhhhh B-E-A-S-T-I-E
Cops get no respect from me
The world's in a state of tyranny
All across the stormy sea
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
Who the hell's gonna rock with me?
Touch the song and get with me now
B-E-A-S-T-I-E go
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
Go</pre>
