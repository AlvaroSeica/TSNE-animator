Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Despot]
The "told ya so" kid, lookin like he's itchin to sing
The day hell got cold, sellin plane tickets to pigs
Time-tested method for turnin a fat chance slim
No win dyin, push whatever's bad back in
And that grin's there is through first, place taste beautiful
A cookie for the straightest faces, spilled milk's funeral
Snoopin through the junk for a tall glass to tip it in
Shootin at his feet only tryin to see what he steppin in
So far just the street, at least makin use of the weapon hand
No promise to keep a set force in the mode of guess again
Food stuck in the bristles, every brush with death tickles
'Round the mouth the whistle creation of birth in the middle
When the pistol swivel towards the sunny spot he chose to sit in
Holding hands up, flashin a joy buzzer, just kiddin
Then a spark and a single shot that start the face sinkin
Caught the bullseye blinkin, thought of that usin thinkin

[Chorus]
Get rich or try dyin, life for the buyin
Out went the beatin hearts and in went the diamonds
Brown when the bleeding starts and green cause it's shinin
Here's to the late great man who left smilin
What a guy - he never died while he was alive
Slap him five - he never died while he was alive
Say goodbye - he never died while he was alive
Six million ways, never gave one a try

"Dig for the golllld, dig for the gollld
Diiiig, for the gold
I'll be a rich man in China, b-b-b-before I grow old"

[Despot]
Here lies the hair that he split from temptations
And the gun still blazin, how's that for patience?
Hammer clappin off, another story for the ages
Snuff dug up snug in the backs of the turned pages
like, "Move or the chapter that you're standin in gets it~!"
For the record he only did it to teach a lesson
So hang your hat on the bullet sleepin take it as a blessin
That chalk outline is stretchin big so everyone can get in
Listen for the best and discover the fastest way to quiet
Tune in to that terrible screamin they call silent
'Til heaven's tremblin hand is there to scratch open your eyes
This nickel pitched between the fingers find today's lottery prizes
Scrapin up shotty is how you fight it's for the feedin frenzy
Tripped over a treasure chest while in hot pursuit of a penny
The shy {*edit*} shoppin cart chock full of that new alchemy
Tin cans to paper and he dragged it off happily

[Chorus]

[Despot]
Caught a shiny glint and thought he finally hit luck
Then a snake in the garden jumped out that can of mixed nuts
Snap it shut quick enough and show it how to lick {cunt}
Short end of the stick taped to somethin big, still tough
One man's garbage is another man's big bluff
Dog got a new hold, opportunity's been stuck
And he's blue from the wrist up, huntin that stubborn payload
Holdin breaths for Jack, caught on the wrong end of the rainbow
Thumb in the goldrush with the ring flipped so the name shows
Other four fingers crossed hard enough to break bones
Sharp enough to stay gold, claim a chunk for free
Now it's hundreds of the same stone worth its weight in debris
But at least he gets to say he chipped away and got a piece
Before he figured out there's ones about, there's nothin here to see
But I still poke it, every X next to a tree
So you probably know the words a little better than me

[repeat to fade]
"Dig for the golllld, dig for the gollld
Diiiig, for the gold
I'll be a rich man in China, b-b-b-before I grow old"</pre>
