[Verse 1]
When we were kids all we used to drink was Coke and ice
Nowadays kids are all about the Coke and ice
This war on drugs is a joke
Since the beginning of time there ain't ever been a dealer that's broke
I don't condone getting high, but condone getting by
Can't you leave me alone while I'm getting mine
I'm, trying to practice my lines 
Off a mirror, backstage, no shame, my moment to shine
Saturday nights are live like this life is Hollywood
But just because you feel good doesn't mean you're OK
Keep your eye on the ball like it's croquet
Cos even a president can fall prey to cocaine
We're all chasing a rush, maybe you're chasing a dream, chasing yourself
Or making a bust
Either way I prey you making a buck
I think they'd take less drugs if the rest of us gave more love

[Chorus: Ozi Batla]
I've been living so wrong, for so long, and I can't change my ways
I won't ever stop trying but I can't get up out this place
Will I be here forever?
Is this forever?

[Verse 2]
From Bob Marley to Bob Dylan
From Picasso to Presley
To John Lennon, to Keith Richards
The brightest minds of our time have been addicted
Or 'enlighted', depending on how you paint the picture
Johnny Cash didn't sleep for days
Hendrix had the whole damn world in a purple haze
Cobain slept on the H-train next to Ray
Round the world Ozzy Osbourne was leading the way
From the top of the Hollywood Hills to the favelas in Brazil
Rich and poor hands are reaching for pills
The truth's inconvenient but cigarettes kill
A lot of people that don't think cigarettes will
Leave em' real short of breath with a hospital bill
Who would have thought that that product would be profitable?
Guess we're terminal by nature - it was bound to happen
That's why death sells like this life is going out of fasion

[Chorus: Ozi Batla]
I've been living so wrong, for so long, and I can't change my ways
I won't ever stop trying but I can't get up out this place
Will I be here forever?
Is this forever?

[Verse 3]
Ey, let's take a look what we have
White male qualified for rehab
Bad habits took him to a place that he didn't want to be at
It ain't nothing to brag about
Those high hopes did nothing but drag him down
He was looking for a way to get the madness out
Jose Cuervo couldn't pull the answers out
But he, never claimed to be a victim
Just felt frustrated that he screamed and the world didn't listen
The world didn't get him
Felt like his feet stuck in setting concrete when he's stepping
Brave new world outside and he's missing it, out of it
Soon side effects become significant, he's floundering
Down again, jammed, can't get with the program
One man's tale of a chemical romance

[Ozi Batla/Tongue]
Blaze it up! Blaze it up! Blaze it up!

[Chorus: Ozi Batla]
I've been living so wrong, for so long, and I can't change my ways
I won't ever stop trying but I can't get up out this place
Will I be here forever?
Is this forever?</pre>
