Intro: 
[Makaveli speaking on the One Nation album]
We got to get the Niggas that runnin' out of here
So that's what we do
Let the gone, now

With Greg Nice, Buckshot, Smiff-N-Wesson
Smiff-N-Wesson, Melle Mel, Scorpio, The Luniz,
Snoop, Kurupt, Daz, Me, Scarface, Kokane,
Bone Thugs, Spice 1
All of 'em on my shit
One Nation
And it's just to hit my nation
All the real Niggas that I recognize in the game

[Napolean]
Outlaw
With that mutherfucking Nigga Yukmouth
Doin' that shit for Rap-A-Lot
So grap your gat a lot, Nigga
Young Niggas on the rise, motherfucker

[Yukmouth]
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em

Verse 1: Napolean
Nigga this is war
We get the shit together right now, Nigga
After midnight, 
this full pound gon' make some sound, Nigga
Kick in the door
I throw your wife on the couch
I put my dick in her mouth
And put that shit in and out
Outlaw no doubt
Ha, what you don't talk some shit
Ha, what make Napolean flip
I blow your
Backbone to your motherfuckin' lap hoes
If you wig it, I'ma take it down
Who do you, gotta stay low
Ha, make a move, Nigga
When your sure improved, Nigga
Outlaw soldier
Take it to school, Nigga
We rule Nigga
Have it
Will rap about your gat or won't you grab it
Feelin' hot like a weapon
Gettin' 16 for my automatic
Thugged out to the overdoses
You Niggas got to sell 'em some shit
You probably thought you could leave quick
It ain't happenin' bitch
It's hard to get mob on mine
Outlawz my spine
It ain't hard to find
But get ya, and lay low
And get ya pis by the dough
I keep my shit on cock, cause Makaveli said so
I keep my shit on cock, cause Makaveli said so

Chorus:

[All]
If you,
[E.D.I]
Got to get your money on
&gt;From night till mo'
You better
[All]
Then do yo thug thang
If you,
[Yukmouth]
Buy Chronic by the zone
Then get yo smoke on
[All]
Then do yo thug thang
If you,
[Young Noble]
Resign the streets
Because you love to bang
[All]
Then do yo thug thang
If you,
[Napolean]
Don't give a fuck about life
I lost my family twice
So I'ma
[All]
Then do you thug thang

Verse 2: E.D.I (Yukmouth)

I been what is know as a bandit (Bandit)
You better hand it over,
if you wanna see your grandkids (Grandkids)
I don't give a fuck (Fuck)
Cause Makaveli planned it
(Cause Makaveli planned it)
But when it's said and done
In the streets
We can handle it
Do yo thug thang, o really (Really)
You don't wanna see me silly (Silly)
With fully loaded 9 milli (9 Milli)
When it get to spittin'
You gon be sittin' me

I'm the epidemy of everthing you fear (Fear)
Crystal clear (Crystal clear)
Pistol there (Pistol there)
In the air

Hit you there (There)
Then I'm out of here (Here)
With your Cartier (Cartier)
And your hottie head (Hottie head)
Between knees (Knees)
I got on the clean knees (Knees)
You ain't see no
Thugs like these, 
with slugs like these
We rush tightly
All in together now
Makin' it mo better now
(Makin' it mo better now)
Layin' competitors down
Ahead of you now
Superial style
Grand imperial thug world
I'm rougher for rhyme
I had you wanted for mine
While I'm gunnin' for mines (Mines)
Thought it was gone, but still on
We commin' to town
(You rainin', clickin' Niggas,
that will see us, man)
You rainin', clickin' Niggas, 
that will see us, man
But if you think, 
you can't do yo thug thang, Nigga
(Do yo thug thang, Nigga)

Interlude: 
[Yukmouth]
<tires slippin="">
Fuck You
Fuck the Outlawz
Fuck the Régime
<machine firin="" guns="">
NIGGA

Verse 3: Young Noble

If you ain't,
lovin' this thug shit
You must be a bitch
Can't compete with the bricks
All the drugdealers rich
Or try to get in
Try to hustle and pear
Walkin' up and down block all day,
'till the rest of the fiends get here
A bitch named Tarifa
She owned 300 thugs 
On a Nigga to hold her beaver
&gt;From the blow I fronted
And do yo thug thang
Rappin (?) drugs slang
(?) and have you losin' you brain
Abusin' the game
So now you're in danger
Lyrically I ruin your name
And keep one in the chamber
Nasty new street slugger,
catch you with a boxcutter
Used to fight with my brother
And run the spot with my mother
You get after, ask her quick 
And shit blast the bitch
Fuckin' around with this Outlaw shit

[All]
Get your thug on Niggas
Ha, then do yo thug thing

Chorus

Verse 4: Yukmouth 

Niggas used to hit me up
Till they see that fuckin' Régime
Stick me up, up in the sky
Firebreatin' dragon
Niggas bout to die
Niggas feel like Armageddon,
when I be headin'
And wait Niggas up at they own wedding
With they own weapons
Counterfessons
Ghetto lesson number one:
Never try to go to war without your gun
Niggas get done
Since I quit fuckin' with Num
I did once like Big Pun
Off the books, 
Have your body in a coffin up
Nigga I'm off the hook
Like a phoneless chuck
That burned out
Thugged out and turned out
Set that motherfucking perm out your head
Niggas dead, 
if you ain't Régime, or Outlaw
Kiss the ring
I do my thug thing without y'all
Matter of fact
I gives a fuck about y'all
Put a Nigga up in a ho
Just like a ground hole
Thanks of the Hounddogg
They finally found y'all
Leavin' (?) on your face
And about 12 motherfuckin' bodies,
hangin' around y'all
I do my thug thang
Dopin' in and out of lanes
And I must thank
(?)
Tats on my arm
I better ring the fuckin' alarm
Or be the first that get mashed on
Nigga, do yo thug thang

Chorus: x2

[Napolean]
Uhhh
