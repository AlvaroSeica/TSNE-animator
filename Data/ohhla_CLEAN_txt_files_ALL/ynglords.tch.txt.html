[Immortal Technique]
New to the world, fresh out the barrio, I was an outlaw rebel
Out of my mind, young and wild
My existence defined in one word
Survive~! Check (Jo-ell Ortiz)

[Joell Ortiz]
If it could be sold, I can sell it, if it can't, that's cool
I'll fix it up make it look good enough to catch some fool
It started when I was young with my Genesis games
He traded me John Madden for it, I don't remember the name
but it was weak though, the streets though, they play with perico
So Tito became my hijo, he had cheap blow
And each O like three fo' times I flip one
But it's evil, the people I deal with'll stick nuns
with big guns, they diesel, that diesel never change
The custy still nod like they agree with ery'thang
The weed ain't the same, all the colors is new
It ain't just green, the haze is purple and them berries is blue
I don't care if it was pink, as long as they still smokin
I had them bags packed 'til they damn near open
The hustle's in my veins, I could bleed in a pot
and make a soup, that'd go for ten dollars a pop

[Immortal Technique]
In la calle, on a collision course with incarceration
Consumed by the lies of the streets
They were an illusion but I awoke
Caged like an animal

[Pumpkinhead]
They got me locked in a cell where I'm feelin like an experiment
My spirit sharper than lasers they used to build pyramids
Writing on the walls keep me sane
Knuckle push-ups on the concrete - 'til I bleed out the pain
Thoughts of my freedom lingerin in my brain
I'm stronger and much quicker, I appreciate the gain
Building with my A-Alikes, brown power reunite
Tattoos of my flag, P.R. pride Jesus Christ
But I wouldn't wish this, on my worst enemy
So when I'm free I'll teach and spread the speech
of how they try to divide us (to make us weak) find us (and break a piece)
So I gotta (to make a peace) honest (I play for keeps)
This is the life of your forefathers that fought hard
On four corners of backyards, power in numbers
So they subtract us and add bars
If they want it, we gon' take 'em to war
We not a gang or a clique, we Young Lords!

[Immortal Technique]
I came to my senses, un esclavo no soy
That is not my past
I came to know me and my people
Red, brown, and black helped me paint the future

[CF]
The world got a template, to turn us into inmates
Caged in a state pen, man fuck goin to Penn State~!
Bonded to slave ships to punch in your timecard
Walk my oasis spacin jungle behind bars
Got my epiphany like Malcolm X
Prison to the bricks, but I'm stuck in this global house arrest
I'm a free man, so I changed my mannerisms
This Greenspan system wanna dent my activism
Estilo machetero get my people out the ghetto
21st Century grito de alar estate quieto
We vocal minorities, no Pokemon tail
Guess the local authorities to be the Ho Chi Minh trail
From robbin bodegas and boostin like low-lives
To media figures, chokin them four-five
Revolutionary gangsters in your presence
Try to dead us with cancer through chemical testin

[Immortal Technique]
Unidos por fin! We seized the time
Free at last, learn to love, live to fight
Not just for me, but for others
Teach the new blood, and live for freedom!

[Immortal Technique]
YEAH; I survived the CoIntelPro assassinations
AIDS epidemic, crack era, fractured a nation
The interpretation of American democracy
is best exemplified, in its foreign policy dichotomy
I live a double life of political philosophy
But revolution follows me, the struggle for equality
against the morally bankrupt, claiming to be born again
It's a civil war again like MS-13's origin
Ban ethnic studies claiming our culture will swallow them
But you can't conquer people and build a country on top of them
and then feel offended that they breathe the same oxygen
Your family values lack the wisdom of Solomon
But Operation Condor and Operation Bootstrap
are Poli Sci 101, research for the new jacks
It's hard to reach, communist utopia tomorrow
when your hands are in a fuckin glass jar like Che Guevara
Forget the distorted historical facts you were given
Slave trade was the capital for capitalism
Trapped in a prison, mentally, dying existentially
Separated from people you can't see yourself to be
then racially integrated into a burning house
Colony of an empire, economically burning out
Can't win a debate, so they sponsor every threat to me
I wonder if Agent 800 is standing next to me

[Outro]
In Puerto Rico, the main problem we have es que somos colonia
We are a colony, we are fighting for freedom
because we will not be a slave nation forever
The struggle here is to make universities
The struggle here is in the community
It's against the police and violence
It's against discrimination, it's against the crime against humanity
on this beautiful Caribbean Island
This is Palabras, peace and que alda
Young Lords, revolutionary always
From San Juan, Puerto Rico
Que viva Puerto Rico libre</pre>
