[Andy Cooper]
The baddest emcee (who's that) not me
I'm Technicolor on a black and white TV
And by the by, a motherlovin son who knows one day
That all of the tears wept will be swept away
So before the giant comes to from the slumber
Dig a last ditch effort to vacate the tundra
Dust off your ears, jump off of your best leg
Out of the catacomb into the nest egg
Now let me get my 15 minutes of fame
And I'll be as straight as Gibraltar
He said he'd make a funky beat and be as sweet as Walter
Payton hatin long drives to 9 to 5's
Man, he wanted high fives when the crowds arrive
So he frequents in sequins doin the neutron dance
Actin all jiggy for the cash advance
I hung a buffalo stance, crossed the Red Sea
And said don't you get fresh with me
Because if freshness was a dinner with all of the dressings
We'd be gluttons pushing buttons in the kitchen with the Jetsons
Dizzy Dustin, Andy, Einstein's the third man
Elevators going up like Junior Birdman

I'm movin up, movin on up
I'm movin up, movin on up
I'm movin up, movin on up
I'm movin up, movin on up, come on

[Dizzy Dustin]
I put the key in the ignition and enter the pole position
To outrun the competition on this expedition
To the Crystal Castle, I can't stay put
A millipede wants to feed on the back of my foot
Kept my eyes straight ahead and dodged the roadblocks
Dips and oil slicks, wet spots and falling rocks
Who wants to see themselves and their friends
grow to be old men, pondering what could have been
Break away the ties that hold me from the skies
and tell the hippy with the sticky not to skip me
You can try to pry the doors when stuck between floors
or call the foreman, but he's barnstorming
So I slide a token down the slot and press player one
to be the slayer in the dragon's lair tappin my thumbs
Against the buttons joystick in hand to command the missiles
Top score once more I enter my initials
Eyein a lion without becoming his lunch
Isn't easy in a pitfall on a jungle hunt
I set out to get out but cement shoes lack traction
So this time I'll climb with some elevator action

I'm movin up, movin on up
I'm movin up, Einstein, what you doing?
"Breaking people up."
Where you going?
"Up to the top floor." - - &gt; Slick Rick

[Andy Cooper]
Steppin to the edge of the platform to plunge
Down into the think tank, the opening is narrow
As I'm hovering above the covering I start to fall
And feel the stomach butterflys rise out of my bone marrow
You can label me with chewing gum envy
cause I wish I could be care free to emcee
For a beatnik to a neatnik and anyone in between
And anyone that's beyond and anyone that's been conned (Strung along)
By the charismatic addict, the man on the stage
Giving power displays to astound and amaze
You'd better follow our ways, cause we've got the solution
But you're gonna have to pay, make a contribution
The Azraels and Gargamels may feel the need
To hurt the little people in order to feed greed
And, hey, they may laugh now, but later
They'll be sorry they didn't ride the elevator

I'm movin up, movin on up
I'm movin up, movin on up
I'm movin up, movin on up
I'm movin up, movin on up

Well, we lost our jobs.
What we're gonna do now?
I don't know, we should start that rap group we've been talking about
You still making beats, Einstein?
Eh, it's a hobby
Well, look who we be called, we could be like "The Fresh Three"
or something like that
I don't know, what about, "Ugly Duckling?"
"Ugly Duckling" Hmmm...
"This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.."
Now, we gotta practice, we gotta get together
You can practice at my house...</pre>
