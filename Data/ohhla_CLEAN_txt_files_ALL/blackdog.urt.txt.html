[Verse 1]
He never thought he'd think of killing himself
Nobody had a doubt of anything to do with his health
He wasn't ever that kind of gentlemen that needed help
Just an everyday bloke trying to handle what he'd been dealt
But it was steadily more difficult to conceal 
And he was too proud to reveal, the lonliest fear that he feels
Envious of those on an even keal
'Cause from where he's sitting that disposition is completely unreal
It's not like his cars lost any one of it's wheels
It's just as if it's been clamped up, secured and sealed
Yo he's flown his white flag and shown he'd yield
Yet the Black Dog relentlessly honed his heel
In a planet of 6 bill' and still not a soul to understand
Too long ago relinquished the upper hand
Got him suffocated, tightened like a cummerband
Recalls what happy is but that's for another man

[Verse 2]
His path is lonely even when it's public
The clown cries tears, the crowd cheers and loves it
Coils in his inner turmoil, cups it, tucks it
neatly, keeps em sweetly unflustered
People of prominence are just as likely
Even if they're hyped as hyphy, bright and fiesty
They might be the John Konrads and Steve Rogers
Gold medals, best and fairest, they got notches
Cars and ski lodgers, they might even be doctors
Tragic characters, silver screen operas
Covinced that they're imposters, row with one oar
Men that made themselves now think they're done for
And they can't talk, someone on the mute button
Men die in bachelor pads, nobody knew nothin'
The view from here is as grey as vacant car parks
Don't ask why it's so hard to laugh

[Verse 3]
It's 2am he's wandering streets alone
Can't remember these avenues they feel unknown
Listen to the droan of a distant truck's compression breaks
Afraid of the frailty of the things he'd set in place
He's had better days, some worse than others
Not the kind of fella proud of sleeping in under the covers
Close up the shutters, take the phone off the hook
And if they enquire he'll reply he was crook, look
It overtook him too long ago and took his honour
Slow but surely, imprisoned like S. Corby
17 years since he celebrated 40, too many candles 
to blow out, and it's too corny
He might make a decision and set off a chain of events
Find a way to say what he meant
But he's spent just looking to get by the black dog
in the corner of his eye won't back off

{Bridge} {X2}
Getting stalked by the Black Dog
Stalked by the Black Dog
You back down but still he won't back off
Unable to navigate without a map of 
the way home
Stalked by the Black Dog
Stalked by the Black Dog
Follow home and hope, why doesn't it back off?
Getting followed
Followed by the Black Dog
