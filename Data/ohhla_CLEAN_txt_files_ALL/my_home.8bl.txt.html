(Verse 1)
My nigga, C
He from Texas, I'm from Tennessee
We do our thang
Wit' them thangs, makin currency
He got the hook-up wit' Columbians and Mexicans
He wraps 'em up and ships 'em out
And I supply the ends
Exellent profit got us livin elegant
Laundromat style washes away the evidence
Get on a plane every week-end and visit
I would visit his town
And he would visit Memphis
Take the nigga clubbin
Embassy suites and freaks
Up all night
Sippin 'tussin, smokin Sweets
One week-end...
I'm in his town, his crib
You really must trust a nigga to show him where you live
Fly scenery, space-age things n' big screens
In the den, shootin pool, puffin on some good green
In walked the woman that was C's fiance
He said that he loved her and would marry her one day
Her name was Angela, damn she was fine
I admit I had evil thoughts rushin my mind
Moschino fittin tight, she was dressed to kill
She winked, but I didn't think the ho was for-real

(Hook)
What am I
Supposed to do
When I'm takin a chance
Fuckin with you (My homeboy's girlfriend)
Now, what if someone
Found out about us
Then, someone
Is gonna get fucked up (My homeboy's girlfriend)

(Verse 2)
The smell of breakfast, woke me up from my dreams
Bakin, sizzlin, searchin for the kitchen like a fiend
What I seen, straight took me by surprise
Angela half-naked, not tryin to hide
She saw me lookin, but kept cookin
What's up wit' that?
Invited me to sit down, and said she'd be right back
I poured a glass of O.J. and pulled up a seat
Angela came right back and sat next to me
Kissed me on my cheek and said...
"Ohh, you cute"
"I don't know what it is, but it's just somethin about you"
With her hand on my leg, she kissed my on my neck
I said, "Baby chill, this is too much disrespect-"
"-If C walked in, he'd be a mad motherfucka-"
"-And ain't no pussy gon' come between brothas-"
"-Lovers, we can't be, cause that's bad business"
[Angela]
"Ohh, you can have all of this, and there won't be no witnesses" 
All in my lap, on my early-morning hard dick
Grindin on it, pullin it
Before I knew, was suckin it
Ended up fuckin it, I guess I'm a weak man
It's hard to understand my homeboy's girlfriend

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
Me and C
Jumped in the Benz and hit the town for a while
I couldn't believe what just happened man, this shit too wild
If C finds out, he might trip and try'ta kill me
And I ain't the type of nigga that's gonna feel guilty
Later on, we was at the pad, kickin back
C, had to make a run to go and serve a pack
Before he made it out the drive-way good
Angela was all on me, tryin'a suck on my wood
On the pool table, on the floor, man what a whore
I was lookin out for C, she was beggin me for more
An hour later, C walked through the door
Un-aware that I was just in his lady's underwear
I flew home the next day, still reminiscin'
Not believin I just dicked on my homie's miss-es
This-is, a fuckin trip man
I will never understand my homeboy's girlfriend
