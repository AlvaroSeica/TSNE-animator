[Small Boy]
I'm blessed with skills, and marvelous
And them daughters, fathers, mothers
This is something I give to you, from my soul
And it goes

[Hook: Small Boy]
This one's for my people, around the way
To all the ones, who keep it player made
For staying down, with H-A-W-K
May you thought, keep it real
Dirty South, for my G's
The haters, run up in the streets
You're the ones, that ride or die for me

[H.A.W.K.]
To the real, who been down since day one
The ones that know H.A.W.K., but also know John
To my mom's, you mean the world to me
And you are the roots, to our family tree
Tina, Paula and me and P-A-T
You gave us all, L-I-F-E
I thank God for you, and all that you do
And I'm gon make sure, all your dreams come true
We had some rough times, no lights no gas
Days without cash, that's the reason I mash
We gon have the last laugh, I promise you that
I put that on Pat, cause I promised him that
To my sisters Tina, Paula, Monique
With y'all support, I will reach my peak
And last but not least, there's Fat Patrick and Leash
And my son Todd, they make me complete

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
To all my real cats, who grew up with me and Pat
Y'all showed me love, now I'm giving it back
Al and Ron-G, Stick to Kiwi
T-O-B-E, and 3-8 and D
My peeps at A.G., Smooth and Big D
Wild Child and 3, Duke and Jimmy D
Them boys off Botany, Lil' Ke and Pokey
Clay-Doe and Mike D, Paul and Big E
Hill and Country, Z-Ro and Big T
My nigga Sean P, and my dog Tim G
The whole S.U.C., is my family
And both of them, K-Y-L-E
R-A-B-B, M-A-R-V
And of course I can't forget, F-U-Z-Z
The Hubert Family, stay strong for Pee-Wee
Cool and the Gang, up there and Jamie

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
To Godfather and Dre, them boys from the Tre
Lil' Black and Shaunte, N.O. and Kay-K

And them Riggs brothers, they gone off the drank

Devany told me, you boys my homie
Cause a real nigga, don't mess with fonies
To my niggaz on lock, what's up Pop and Rock

To the Blount brothers, man I feel your pain
What happened to Big George, was a god damn shame

And lost but not least, this one's for my fans
