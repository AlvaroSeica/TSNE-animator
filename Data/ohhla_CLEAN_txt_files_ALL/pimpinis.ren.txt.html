[Intro: MC Ren Talking]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ugh, soft life'll go down "what?" 
Soft life go down
ugh, ugh, yeah "soft life'll go down"
Pimpin' is free, Pimpin' is free
Yeah, y'all make this pimpin' for free

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
All these niggaz actin' crazy up
Pimp holder men, I'll make you dusty like them middle East
Fuck up your peace, I'll take every thing you got
Mothafucker like two deuces
How you're blowin' up my mamma pager just to make a truce? 
New milleniums "what?" 
But knowledge helped me to stay the same age
Since 1987 bein' featured on the Rap page
Movin' at the speed of sound till my shit's mixed  "what?"
Got enough hits, if your ass need a fix
Bitches naked to get fucked up
While the Chevy bouncin' like you hover
I talked to niggaz on top amounts with the street dialect
Gangster shit revised
If the translation hit your ass since '85
Takin' mothafuckers too many many schools "what?"
Chillin' on sundays with another rules
Simple minded niggaz can't comprehind that
All y'all talkin' about is blunts and gats, ugh, ugh

[Chorus: MC Ren]
I'ma hit you like this, fake-Ass-Niggaz
These lyrics is gettin' drop
The mothafuckin' shittin' will never stop
Nigga shakin' up the Earth
Peeps and the Villain is, got you mothafuckers feelin' this 
Ugh, the pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, awww yeah
I said the pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, awww yeah

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
The black guys flippin' streets shit like the quarter burnt
Groupie mothafuckers tryin' to check every word
These wack-Ass-Niggaz, y'all elementary
Villain got the lyrics locked 'til the next century "ugh"
When the westcoast is dryin' the 'Pacific
I be holdin' my deck, in the studio and bein' Explicitin'
While y'all be pumped gas at forties bitch stations
Kissin' ass, erasin' the common lines for that rotation
My hesitation nigga only to sex
Based to face black tragular, better hide your necks
Or you can has it, more than vottin' loot
You wanna hit nigga, realize you're just a flute
C-P-T in the books, nigga like gauge shycome
All the shit I ever made nigga floatin' in your dome
What's up? - my dick correct it like impire state
Mothafuckin' Villain be the great, ugh

[Chorus: MC Ren w/ minor Variations]
I'ma hit you like this, fake-Ass-Niggaz
These lyrics is gettin' drop
The mothafuckin' shittin' will never stop
Nigga shakin' up the Earth
Peeps and the Villain is, got you mothafuckers feelin' this 
The pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, awww yeah
I said the pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, awww yeah

[Verse 3: Peeps] 
Unload from the G off road and off stage
Dose explode like rex hit with a 12 gauge 
Still I rips, into scripts, produce hits
The moment I return from my indo trigger
That's why I stutter, twenty 3rd, yeah 
Twenty three times more savier
Still in first deal as I wait to get straps
Hustle for tracks, then I hook some with my Chingolet
Jet like rat, it's B.G. and when we bang it that way
The limit is the sky way, don't play
Got Goerge hit the fuckin' high way, goes way
And if you walked in this house with him
Then you bitch-ass-Nigga bounce with him
With out ever heat??
You will survive then we'll collide in the range
Butt and sweatin' tears never pays 
These days, dulo shit, I'm willin'
To get the feelin, I'm corrupt like killin'
Known that I'm fuckin' with the Villain

[Chorus: MC Ren w/ Minor Variations]
I'ma hit you like this, fake-Ass-Niggaz
Ugh, these lyrics is gettin' drop
The mothafuckin' shittin' will never stop
nigga shakin' up the Earth
Peeps and the Villain is, got you mothafuckers feelin' this 
Ugh, the pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, awww yeah
I said the pimpin' is free, cause y'all don't make money, awww yeah
