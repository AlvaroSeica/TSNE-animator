[Chorus]
The girls be lovin this (we love dat)
The girls be lovin this (uh-huh uh-huh)
If the girls they love me not (and no we don't)
But the girls be lovin this (that's right)
The girls be lovin this (we love dat)
The girls be lovin this (uh-huh uh-huh)
If the girls they love me not (and no we don't)
But the girls be lovin this (that's right)

(Verse 1)
They like, big chevys big benz big jagz
Big GT bikes sittin on 12 inch mags
BIG bras small bras cuz I let fall bras
Tall bras it dont matter cuz I love yall bras
They like a big bank big faces, big bills a big dog
Running back of a house on the hill 
Big bed so we could get freaky n wild 
Big freeser to hold my moe and Crystal 
What

( Chorus )

(Verse 2)
It takes a fool like C to spend some cheese
But a playa like C that could hit for free 
No jewls no cars no honey beez and if she 
Aint on her back then she on her kneez
Child please!!, wont you buy me a car
Hey buy me a drink when you at the bar
Just want my money spend just like my can
I know you wanna sugar daddy but I ain't that man
Uh

( Chorus )

(Verse 3)
I like a balla with a first class platimun plac
Gucci (Guchi) with a skirt witha matchin hat
You see I wanna man that would spend some grands
That would move me from a sun burn and ice my hand
You keep playin think you cant give me my jag and key
You think you just come up on the bed and just freak for free
You better claim up on these rocks and let them put you to sleep
Cause guaranteed that by the morning you be lovin me

If you ridin by the ville
Yeah I bet you love that
Gotta house on the hill
Yeah I bet you love that
If you rollin gucci wheels 
Yeah I bet you love that
And all the chickens  on the streets 
Tell them what holla back
Lil mama you talkin bout all this receivin n shit
What they do out on yo gig cuz im leadin you chick
You forgot about them brain you needa give it a lick
Thats all I want cuz I aint married to trick 
Wha

( Chorus )

We love that
Uh huh uh huh
No we dont
Thats right
We love that
Uh huh uh huh
No we dont
Thats right</pre>
