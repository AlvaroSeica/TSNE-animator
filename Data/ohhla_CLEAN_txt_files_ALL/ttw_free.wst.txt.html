Even though I ain't wired up
We-we-we fired up
You ain't seen my shows lately
They be linin' up
You ain't seen them girls lately, they be tryin' to cut
But they heard about my girl so they still chill
Cause Monica Lewinsky already Killed Bill
And that girl that was with Kobe tried to go for the kill
I think he put it in her wrong Holyfield
Can I take a minute with y'all to be totally real?
As far as my jaw and all, it ain't totally heal
If I would have died, June 23 of last year
That would have threw a monkey wrench in my whole career
But me
I take the worst thing, turn it into the best thing
I'm from the Chi, I guess it's just a mid-west thing
Times like this make life interesting
Times like this make me count my blessings
Cause you can run around like king of the Chi
But God can take that in a blink of an eye
I remember Cedar Side and almost cryin'
Mama I'm sorry for almost dyin'
Tell Al G and Hip Hop man
Tell Don I'ma let y'all monopolize the game
Add on Benny Medina we gonna take him to the cleaners
I'm Kanye West the College Dropout slash genius
Through the wire
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All the beats beats beats beats beats
All of them coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep
Always thank the Lord
For this mic and my keyboard
After all that boy is raw

Now if the rock is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the rock is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the rock is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
Throw your diamonds in the air
Throw your diamonds in the air
Now keep 'em in the air
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
We outta here
