H-U-S-T-L-E, you know we
Rock this city, baby
They can't do it, like you do
They ain't got it like you do, boss
 
[Mya]
Every single day, I appreciate
You give me, what I want
I know the game done changed, but you still remain
And you stay, posted up
And when the block gets hot, know I got you babe
Until it, cools down
I'm gonna stay right here, it's forever till
We both meet the ground, (get your money)

[Mya]
Every other day, when it rains it pours
Living, in the hood
And it's so sexy, how you change up the weather report
You flip that, back to good whoooa
And you just the kind of man, I've been looking for
So I'm gon', hold you down
And just like Martin needs Caretta, Bonnie needs her Clyde
And that's just, what I found in you

I'm just riding, on my grind - 2x
 
[Z-Ro]
Damn right, I'm a hustler baby
I don't even move, unless it's gon' pay me
I know you wanna see me, but I don't know maybe 
Baby, cause I'm trying to get rich daily
Damn right I'm a boss, and you know that
But when I leave the house, I can't wait until I go back
I gotta move some mo' packs, to get some mo' stacks
From Houston to D.C., but I'll be back
Your long disctance lover baby, I'll be that
I know you like kush, with no seeds in the sack
I'm just playing with ya baby, but I know you feel that
I'm trying to get us a million bucks, so we can relax
Somewhere, where can't nobody find out where we at
Selling em fo' and a halves, and O's was arrest
But I'm running this city, and can't nan neer do it like me
Cause I do it like this, on the real
