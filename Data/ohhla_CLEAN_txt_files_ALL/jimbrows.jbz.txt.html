[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
Yeah, that's what it be
Jimbrowski, y'all
Subject matter of the '80s
So Sam
Talk to me about this

[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
Now here we have a theory that makes me kinda weary
It's a humorous matter that makes my eyes teary
[ Mike G]
Jimbrowski
[ Red Alert ]
Hihihihi...
[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
Yeah, that's what they call it
The thing's so big you need a U-Haul to haul it
It's up on the tip, it's up on the top
This flamboyant thing cannot be stopped

[ Afrika Baby Bam &amp; Mike G ]
Jimbrowski
That's what it is

[ Red Alert ]

This matter is for real, so let's be real about it
You always talk about it cause you can't live without it
[ Mike G ]
In the evenin when you're dreamin
Wake up in the mornin, you must start schemin
Cause...
[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
Cause...
[ Red Alert ]
Say what?
[ Mike G ]
Jimbrowski's on your mind
[ Afrika Baby Bam ]

[ Mike G ]
Takin up most your time
[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
Your time
[ Mike G ]
Yo, Jimmy helped me write this rhyme
[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
This rhyme
[ Mike G ]
So when you're feelin blue
Don't front on the Jimmy
[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
Why?
[ Mike G ]
Cause Jimmy can help you
[ Red Alert ]
Youuuu...

[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
If I told you Jimbrowski was seven feet tall
What would you do?
What would you say?
How would you feel?

[ Red Alert ]
I'm tellin you man, Jimbrowski is located in your nearby neighborhood
If anybody come to you about Jimbrowski, you can tell them that we can do this
If not you know you can ask the Jungle Brothers, man

[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
J-i-m-b-r-o-w-s-k-i

[ Afrika Baby Bam (&amp; Mike G) ]
Jimbrowski is badder than your (baddest rope chain)
I guess that should (explain) why it was given the dope name
For some it's free, for others there's a fee
(But if you come to me, I give the Jimmy for free)
Spell it with a (Jay) and with a (Gee)
What do the Jungle Brothers call it?
(The Jimbrows...)
[ Red Alert ]

[ Afrika Baby Bam ]
