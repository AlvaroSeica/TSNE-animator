[Intro: P.Diddy + (B2K)]
We sendin' this one out
To all the ladies all over the world
All those sexy mama's

You know I like it when your body go 
(Bump, bump, bump)
Bad Boy, B2K
Yo O talk to 'em playa

[Verse: Omarion + (P.Diddy)]
I like ya little sexy style
Love it when you getting wild
Girl in the club with me
(I'm over here, let me talk to you for a minute
I need to tell you something)
Girl you need to be in magazines
Wear a crown on your head cause you a Ghetto Queen
Like bling bling bling (uh, you fine girl)
The way you shaking that sexy ass
Your body shaped like an hour glass
Baby we need to spend some time (yea, let's do it y'all)
I wanna get you to myself
Me and nobody else
And do the things we do
Baby there is something that I need from you

[Chorus - 1: B2K]
Baby turn around 
And let me see that sexy body go
Bump, bump, bump 
(That is all I want to see
Baby show me, show me)

Baby turn around 
And let me see that sexy body go
Bump, bump, bump 
(The way you're throwing that thing at me
I can't take it baby)

[Verse: Omarion + (P.Diddy)]
I love the way you teasin me 
Gonna have to stop pleasing me
While we're on this floor 
(Stop teasin me baby, I want you)
Ooh yea, you're kicking it round and round 
I love the way you put it down 
You're makin me scream for more
