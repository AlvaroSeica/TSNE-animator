Quik:
Ha ha yeah check it out money &amp; pussy make the world go 'round
(That's right) That's how it's been since the beginning of time.

Now who says we can't be fly?
Who say Compton niggas can't get they scrilla
at the same time get some thigh
well uh that's the subject of my conversation
cause ain't nothin' like gettin' a dollar &amp; some penetration
Now that's a whole lot easier to understand now a days
but uh some of you playas still be going out sideways
so umm just take this game with a tic tac
cause if you was on Skid Row you can get
pussy faster than a Big Mac
I owe it to myself to be fly that's what Top Dog taught a boy
cause instead of Mounds these bitches always want Almond Joy
because uhh "Sometimes they feel like a nut"
but they rather have it more often than they don't
So I won't go flippin' &amp; makin' it topsy turvy
now keep my hundred dollar bills crisp &amp; that ass curvy
cause ain't nuthin' on my mind but to be fly through time
havin' a nest egg bird behind an estate that's mine
Watchin' Jordan go for forty in a sucker tub
eatin' Cheetos drinkin' Mo' &amp; getting a back scrub
because first you get the power then you get the money
then you get the pussy dude don't be no dummy uhh

Chorus El Debarge:
Playas get they paper when they game is tight
and if you want some nana that's for you to decide
But as long as you ain't simpin' then ya doin' it right
'cause together they go hand in hand Oh yeah
(repeat)

D:
She wanna make me break code but I can't
I wanna fire it up &amp; hit it pass it like dank
baby all in my square big buddha long hair
Fly Chinese &amp; Black for a mack plus player
D baby I'ma get ya hot wanna get ya full blown
so we all can hit the spot (now you gotta shake the spot)
Got game by the tons lookin' for some 2nd II None
kinda fun but these hookers on the run for cover
they lookin' for lovers ain't no trickin' young D
'cause I'm unlike the others not a buster
I'm on the mission for figures time up for you diggers
(Now who got the Henn'?) Pass the liquor
Hoes hear the name it get's 'em hotter
spin a scraggler on a wheel now they call me D the Potter
lotta hatin' going on but I ain't with it
I'ma mash on that drama everytime that I feel it
'Cause I'd rather have a major end than have sex
and when I have a million to splurge you know what's next
but first you get the power then you get the money
then you get the pussy fool don't be no dummy

Chorus

Bridge
El Debarge talking:
Yeah first comes the power then the money heh
and if you really just want it the
na na na na la di da na na na la di da

KK:
I understand that you think you grown
independant on ya own with ya jazzy ways
my intent is ya lay but first I'm out to get paid not played
can't be yo' incredible edible egg
I don't crack nor split my yolk with the female folk
now baby break yourself get broke you can choke
off this young black better than Mary Jane
in ya brain I'm guaranteed to have ya thinkin' &amp; feelin' thangs
like yourself now uhh watch ya health if ya feel like plottin'
ya body turns rotten from the inside out that pussy's turned out
getting hit by a sucker a 2 minute brother
who's first 10 seconds is thinkin' he came up
that next full minute suckin ya drama up
50 seconds to go see half of that is the show
Now where the other half you can't laugh
'cause you know it's straight simpin' &amp; whinin'
'stead of pimpin' &amp; grindin' KK'll let you know
so pay attention bro
See first you get the power then you get the money
then you get the pussy don't be the dummy though

Chorus 4X</pre>
