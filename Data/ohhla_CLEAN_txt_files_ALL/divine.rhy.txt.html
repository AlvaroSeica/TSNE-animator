Song:   Divine Right of Kings
Typed by: @RhymeAsylum

[Chorus]
Its either sink or swim get ripped limb from limb 
We stuck with this through thick and thin (Argh) 
And we the kings of kings 
So bow down, now, pucker up kiss the ring (Mwah) 
Its either sink or swim get ripped limb from limb 
We stuck with this through thick and thin (Argh) 
And we the kings of kings 
So bow down, now, pucker up kiss the ring

[Verse 1: Possessed]
My acapellas are an act of terror, mad professor
Drill sergeant's skulls with a Black and Decker
Anorexic man possessed with Samson's strength 
Pull the Pillars of Hercules back together
Taken for granted like genies and jinns  
Swallow live grenades pick my teeth wit the pin
The father of lies
Tried to commit suicide slicing my wrist it only sharpened the knife
(Homie) larger than life, got you trembling shook
I'm fishing with President Bush's head on a hook
(Cursed) who inherits my looks
Spark forest fires flame breathing down your neck of the woods
If the crowd stand still, their scared stiff
Forget Eve I made the Blair Witch from my spare rib
Creations master stroke
Scrutinised Medusa's eyes, was only left with a heart of stone
I'm from parts unknown
Lay undiscovered for a hundred thousand years in Antarctic snow
Twisted S.O.B microphone fiend
I'm the one you but don't see
My picnic's a few sandwiches short
You get dispatched and put back in contact with the source
We carry the torch
You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours with adamantium claws

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2: Psiklone]
I was sent here from the future to serve my mission alone
Descendent of medusa turning my optician to stone
I write lines in poisonous lead
My overpowering presence replaces the voice in your head
Keep body parts refrigerated
I got attitude - replaced cabin crews parachutes wit pillowcases
Integrated with the matrix
Fight myself rapidly moving between two different places
Knowledge trapped in forgotten chapters
Crossed the atlas with prehistoric packs of Velociraptors
Yo... I solve codes and impossible puzzles
Run rings round you like 2-player Sonic and Knuckles
Inflicting multiple injuries
Open my mouth and unleash vultures and killer bees
Vocals blow you to smithereens
My head grows a new body if you sever my throat with a guillotine
Deflecting military firing squads
I was an atheist until I finally clocked that I was God
Tongue tied in knots mouth shut with iron locks
Brain seeps from my skull thinking outside the box
Searching Firefox to murder cyber cops
Break the Bill Gates smash the windows n burgle Microsoft
Don't get your wires crossed you're far from the truth
I'm no geek I'm just infinitely smarter than you
