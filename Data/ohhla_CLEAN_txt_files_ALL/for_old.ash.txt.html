Coolin' in the shade, yeah
To all my emcees, djs, b-boys and writers
Pullin all nighters tryna make it right
Consider this a salute from yours truly,
Asheru, the human beacon speaking truth to light

It's about that time, it's about that time to get paid
[While you were sleeping]
It's about that time, it's about that time to get paid {x2}
Coolin' in the shade, yeah

To all my emcees, djs, b-boys and writers
Pullin' all nighters tryna make it right
Consider this a salute from yours truly
Asheru, the human beacon, speaking truth to light {x2}

Just keep doing your thing and represent for your culture
Don't let nobody misrepresent you
Like these cats who would rather you dumb your shit down
For the masses than to rock for the intelligent few
Sometimes I feel like we need a new definition of the words that define us
Music that we love, maybe it's just because I got too much ambition and
Wanna be more than just a thug in a club
I traveled all over the world, wined and dined and had a good time
with folks of every color and hue
From my different conversations and combinations of experience
I been able to change my worldview
Hip hop is a universal language
We all speak fluently and shapeshift to fit congruently
Started in the Bronx around the same time I was born
And now look, it's a worldwide community
Built upon the foundations of peace, unity, love and havin' fun
Word to Zulu Nation
Cause these'll be the same principles that I'ma hand off to my son
