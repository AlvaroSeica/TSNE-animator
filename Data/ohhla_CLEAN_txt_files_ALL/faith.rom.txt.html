Song:   Faith
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus 1]
when times get hard I put my head to the sky
get on my knees and take a deep sigh
never ask why just believe in my faith
and know he'll lead me through each day
I say when times get hard I put my head to the sky
get on my knees and take a deep sigh
never ask why just believe in my faith
and know he'll lead me through each day c'mon

[Romeo]
my faith solid man strong as a rock
my belief in the lord man strong as a ox
he keep my head right so I gotta give praise
kept me out the streets and got me through this crazy maze
I never doubt him cuz without him I wouldn't be much
always stay humble and cool I don't need much
before I close my eyes I always let him know
I'm thankful for everyday I learn and he let me grow
in situations where I coulda took a bad turn
he strayed me away from the streets and catching a bad burn
so our father thanks for the many blessings
and our father I'll see you when I get to heaven
and I know that the world ain't all good
but I do know yo word is all good
so I'ma keep my hands up to the sky
keep the man in my heart my soul and in my mind

[Chorus]

[Romeo]
C'mon</pre>
