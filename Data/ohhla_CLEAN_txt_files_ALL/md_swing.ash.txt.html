[Asheru talking]
(Ya'll don't know right here this is the next single featuring
my man Talib Kweli, called Mood Swing, we gonna do it like this y'all)

[Asheru]
You can run to every new thing under the sun
you be a jack of all trades and a master of none
Mood Swinging.  

[Singers in Background]
La la la la la... eh oooo oo X4

[Verse 1: Asheru]
Soon come you will understand
the motivation of a man getting the under hand
A local yokel on a mission to get global
lettin my vocals amass to some total
and keep the point focal, you hear me but you don't listen
you think its easy being put in this position
I freak speech, but still don't wanna preach,
ts peak thought in stimulate movement at at Emcees
grab your gat hit the streets, that the rally cry the war horn
the activist, those cats is spiritually war torn environment
so I leading a community movement
and I don't need money for me to make a community improvement
Tell me what you stand for
would you settle for less or do you have the strength to demand more
Only time will tell, what this New World brings
revolutions at order, check the Mood Swing, swing
swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Low like sweet chariot
what I say make my voice deep as berries get
carry it like a torch
Give birth to rhymes to meet beats and then I'll marry em off
have a divorce if the track is wack
(Please) My rhymes a rolling stone
home is where the high hatters at, its on this song
(it on this song) maybe one day it'll settle down
it ain't no good it all better now, come on let it now

[Chorus]
Mood Swing, changing the way we do things
its a good thing, listen to the whole hood sing
as they go La, La, La, La, La...
Yeah as they go La, La, La, La, La...
No fear no doubt and no worry everything is on time there's no hurry
Mood swinging, swinging, Mood swing, swinging
Mood swinging, swinging, Mood swing, swinging, oooo oo

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Me and baby in the rental
she talkin gentle hit the hotel to presidential
Sweet... kisses on the temple make her feel special
light a candle scent got us in this sentimental
MOVE its right wit the light just so I could see
begin to set the pace for what we gon get into
my fingers is lyrics its back is the instrumental...
Ancient Secrets, Indian, and Oriental
blackin out doin shit that I can't rap about
passin out, wakin up, not awake awake enough to take it up and not STOP
Love is a friends never know if we can love again
I said we gotta leave, she asked if she can come again (come again)
I had to meet Asheru at the studio
I'm runnin late, you know I hate to make a nigga wait
but damn baby "You look good in the summer time
Gimme some of yours, I'm a give you some of mine."

[Verse 4: Asheru]
Yo Kweli I remember being in the same dilemma
hip-hop was number one my girl was number one contender
the great pretender wit a whole different agenda
until I make it big "Life is one long gig."
Mood Swing like Ella of Cold Train its classic
like Soul Train its timeless just like this rhyme is
so all of y'all that wagging they campaign
grab a hold of that Mood Swing and do the damn thing

[Chorus]
Mood Swing, changing the way we do things
its a good thing, listen to the whole hood sing
as they go La, La, La, La, La...
Yeah as they go La, La, La, La, La...
Uh You can run to every new thing under the sun
you be a jack of all trades and a master of none
Mood swinging, swinging, Mood swing, swinging
Mood swinging, swinging, Mood swing, swinging

[Verse 5: Asheru]
I'm an outlet
a front of which which you ain't figured out yet
a resource, I pivot your efforts on the right course
it seats ya, doin whatever it takes ta reach ya
all of its in me, no really its in me
A good brother, lovin son, a great lover
I'm a truth seeker, on a quest not a believer
I'm an Emcee for all of the world to see
yea ya got my word on it, I'll put the Herd on it
that we rep shit, its the least to be expected
fuck that prep shit, jump on stage like we connected
from the same minds saying the same things at the same time
back stage rappin like gettin ready for game time
we a family, and ain't nothing goin to change that
for better or worse like somebody prearrange that
the way it is the way it always will be so I can still and still be
Soon come we will witness a shift in consciousness
and black music is one of our greatest accomplishments
(one now) our names will live on this monument
so that our kids can hold up they heads with confidence
that's when our nation will rise and realize that 

[Kweli]
Life without knowledge is death in disguise

[Asheru]
The answer to my comprehension is just too complex
one minute from the next, go from happy ta vexed

[Singer]
Mood Swing, yea 
see change is good sometimes 
Mood Swing, yea
its time for the essence to rhyme
Its time to Mood Swing
take it on back
Mood Swing (repeat)
La, La, La, La (repeat)
