[Verse 1]
Creepy crawling, in ya crib, we're comin'to kill
catch you while ya sleep, wake up to a gun in ya grill
Doing Satan's business, tie you up, hang you
22cal. bang bang you - Mephisto with a pistol
on methedrine crystal, give me all the money
to me you're less than shit stool - Juxed 51 times
women screaming, blood everywhere bound and
gagged in fear you star, beg for ya life
break the gun handle on ya skull, take a jagged knife
then like an animal indulge in non-stop stabbing trife -
puncture pregnant bitch, rupture arteries
my horrific cult of vultures - Butchering, no remorse
bludgeoning, slit ya throat, gushing like a flushed toilet
now ya hunched - My infamous psycho posse
tagging pig up on the door in blood
you cant stop me from..

[Chorus]
Stabbing and stabbing and stabbing and stabbing
and stabbing and stabbing and stabbing  and
stabbing and stabbing and stabbing and stabbing
and stabbing and stab you to death! - (Until you die)
- (My cult keeps) - (Viciously)

[Verse 2]
Face down on the bed, pillow case over ya head
lamp cord choked, leave everyone in the place
dead - Knife to ya chest, ya colon flexes slashing
the word war in your solar plexus - We're piranhas
get you prepped for embalmers - ya pleading, bleeding
profusely in your pajamas - Attacking my prey like a
starving hawk - Jux ya buttocks with an ox and a
carving fork - Senselesscrime, no motive, sacred deed -
shock the world, make'em stand up and take heed -
Needle tracks on my arm, influenced by Beatles tracks
doing your featl sac harm - Patty, do something witchy later -
Helter Skelter in blood on the refrigerator - Exit, me and my
vicious accomplices hitch-hike back to the ranch, mission accomplished

[Chorus]
Stabbing and stabbing and stabbing and stabbing
and stabbing and stabbing and stabbing  and
stabbing and stabbing and stabbing and stabbing
and stabbing and stab you to death! - (Until you die)
- (My cult keeps) - (Viciously)</pre>
