Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Close your eyes I want to write the skies in my sweet dream
Pink flame mixtape, is y'all ready?
Close your eyes I want to see it tonight in my sweet dream

Smoking in my fence off, niggas get late off
I took a loss but I pick the case off
Niggas getting chooses, oh he's catching cases
Dirty mack, we don't give a fuck about this state ship
Keep dope pot, so I'll always stay station
I'll be coming up like a nigga I was patient
Paints of the game, he said he couldn't take it
She fuck me over now, now we outside waiting
He said he lost, his brother to the army
We're serving look gasket, don't take me baskets
Shot gonna sound like the song I was mastered
Most rap niggas and my sons or a bastard
Be how you do it, my life is fantastic
I used to be a nigga who a dream it couldn't grab it
Now I wake up and I got my cake up a rico
This a water release
And focus to Japan the best in me
The world on my back and they're waiting for it
Pink flame mixtape the world waiting for it
