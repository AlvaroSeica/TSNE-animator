I don't really wanna go...
I should just stay here with you...
We don't have to say goodbye...
Because we can not move on, and I've told you this several times before...
And I'll tell you over again, and over again...
I love you...
I love you...
I love you...
Oh!!

[Big Boi]
I used to be in lust, I wouldn't call it love
or give my heart away, that's somethin' that I never does
See, I'mma leave it to the scrubs and the cake boss
Let that broad go, uncuff her, take your cape off
When she with me, she feel free, like her days off
Balls in her hand, but that bitch don't ever say cough
'Less we playin' doctor
with no stethoscope, just heels and those knockers, yeah
I'm mister wrong, but she sure know not to
get fly at the mouth, or step outta pocket
Never violence, I give em silence
But I rub my stick on your chick like a violin

[Chorus: Sarah Barthel]
It's all you want these days cause you feel nothing inside...
You know there's nothing wrong, but you've been wondering why...

[Big Boi]
Ain't nothin' wrong...
Ain't nothin' wrong...

I'm Daddy Fat Saxxx, S-A triple X
My music sounds so good, it's almost like we're havin' sex
Whether you like it or not, I'm next
And I got the time after that, and the time after that
because see time and time again, I gotta turn back around and tell em
My cerebellum, get way more deeper than these other fellas
Not only about cheddar, but what about the seasons never change and the weather stays the same
We could come together, but that might be lame 
Could learn something
Peep game, nah, nigga, burn somethin'
(Nah, nigga, burn somethin')
(Nah, nigga, burn somethin')

[Chorus: Sarah Barthel]
It's all you want these days cause you feel nothing inside...
You know there's nothing wrong, but you've been wondering why...

[Big Boi + Sarah Barthel]
I ask for a slice of her pie
Sweet potato with the cool whip, oh, my
She gave me a hug, and on her thigh, she felt my buddy
from touchin', I'm excited
Am I invited? 
Let, let me in
You puddled up, goin' let me swim

[Chorus: Sarah Barthel]
It's all you want these days, cause you feel nothing inside...
You know there's nothing wrong, but you've been wondering why...

[Sarah Barthel]
I read the horoscope, and it's been telling me lies...
I thought I knew you, but your heart is almost blind
I thought I knew you, but your heart is blind
I thought I knew you, but your heart is almost blind
I thought I knew you, but your heart is blind 

This shit easy, nigga...
But I break motherfuckin' records, nigga, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Look that shit up, nigga, talk to me, nigga
Bankhead, shawty, man
Fuh - Google me, nigga
You ain't gotta Google me, nigga
Find me on Bankhead's own one, nigga
Right around the corner from Stankonia, you dig?
Hustle Game, what it do?
D.T.P., what it do?
Dungeon Family, what it do?
TALK TO MEEEEEEE!!!! (TALK TO MEEEEEEE!!!!)
Fuck that pussy ass nigga, prayer, play</pre>
