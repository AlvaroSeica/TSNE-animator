[Intro]
How much is that Golden Motorcycle? 

[Chorus: x2]
Whoo ooooh ooooh 
Whoo ooooh ooooh
Whoo ooooh ooooh la la

[Verse One]
Hello everybody
Put your hands up
It's Pigeon John you know how we do, we get buck
Shakin' off the old, puttin' on the new
And everything's changed since the L.A. Symph crew
Well, not really cause we still actin' silly
At local Taco Bells cause we got to get chili
Like, get another refill, you know it's real
And waste another night cause we got a record deal
I bought some new pants
With my record advance
Now every single night all I do is dance
Hook up with my friends, yo let's take a chance
To spread the true love and the God advice

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Well well well check it
I've been chillin' with Coffee, drinkin' coffee
Exchange how we wanna change, gettin' lofty
I wanna know the verb so I gotta read the word
I used to be the nerd now I'm shhh like a bird
Big up to Bonafied with his wife by his side
And T Kleezy make the party people live
I be playin' polo with that niggy Oh No
And he know
He owe me five bucks
Yo take it slow though
Yo
It's life and it's different than the norm
And you know I gots to give it up to DJ Form
b-Twice is dating my little sister
It's kinda crazy, but it's cool and I miss her
Hey
Can I sing you a song?
(Oh yes you can)
I promise that it won't be long
It's only about all my people and my friends
And my crew 
Yo there's no one equal

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And it goes
Big up to Nashville city like
And all the girls that look pretty like
And all my boys that get silly like
Wait, okay wait wait wait like
Big up to Nashville city like
And all the girls that look pretty like
And all my boys that get silly like
I got the gold motorcycle
Big up to Nashville city like
And all the girls that look pretty like
And all my boys that get silly like
Wait, okay wait wait wait like
And all the girls that look pretty like
And all my boys that get silly like
I got the gold motorcycle
I got the gold motorcycle
I got the gold motorcycle
I got the gold motorcycle
