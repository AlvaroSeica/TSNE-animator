[Kid Cudi]
(I'm off on an adventure)
We're good
This here is dedicated to all the kids like me
Wherever you are
(I'm on my way to, heaven)
Here, now, we're good

Birds sing, flyin around
You never see them too long on the ground
You wanna be one of them.. yeah {*2X*}
You might hear the birds singin, flyin around
You never see them too long on the ground
You wanna be one of them.. yeah {*2X*}
Whoa now!

[Chorus]
Hey, Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager
Tell me where you goin, tell us where you headed
(I'm off on ad-ven-ture) Mr. Rager
Tell me some of your stories, tell us of your travels
Hey, Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager
Tell me where you goin, tell us where you headed
(I'm on my way to heaven) Mr. Rager
Can we tag along? Can we take the journey?

[Kid Cudi]
Knocked down round for round
You feelin like you shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end?
When will the heaven begin? Yeah
You might be knocked down round for round
You feelin like you show down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? Yeah
When will the heaven begin? Yeah
Whoa now!

[Chorus] w/ minor ad libs

[Kid Cudi]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh {*4X*}

[Chorus] w/ minor ad libs

[Outro]
Can we take that journey?
(I'm off on ad-ven-ture)
Hey, Mr. Raaaaaaager {*4X*}
