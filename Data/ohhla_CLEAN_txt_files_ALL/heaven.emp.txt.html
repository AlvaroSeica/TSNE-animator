Song:   Heaven
Typed by: seancookbeats@hotmail.co.uk

If these last days of time
Does the earth spin faster?
I often fantasise about the life and here after
Paradise, the afterlife, land of the pleasant
I dream of how my life be when I get to heaven
I don't embrace the taste of death
But I don't feat it...
Vision of heaven draw me near it
Everlasting life as a spirit
I obey the commandments, Universal laws
I prophesize about heaven
This is what I saw...
I was placent in the land of milk and honey, fascination
I was given powers beyond the average imagination
But peep this, what I saw next left me speechless
in heaven, everyone had the same level of uniqueness 
in heaven, theres no greed, no need for worldly things
no diamond studded rings, peasants become kings
I don't know about you all
But this is were I got to live
Where men and women don't have to be so provocative
And live as true kings
See in the way we do things
Intoxicate your minds without that gin a juice that snoop brings
By far in the heaven the world is ours
No more drugs, money and cars
Just suns moons and stars 
Reunited In the universal family 
The man in me cant wait for heaven to fulfil my wildest fantasies
As I search for better days and praise the number seven
When I get to heaven...
 
So fresh, (so fresh)
So fly (so fly)
My life in paradise
 
So fresh, (so fresh)
So fly (so fly)
My life in paradise
 
Once again it's the Last Emp the raw
These lyrics wont leave you gassed
In heaven I encounter famous spirits from the past
I crack jokes with black folks
Like robin Harris and Red Fox
Loungin' with Bob Marley, giving me tips on my dreadlocks
To put it loosely, an angel will introduce me
To all these famous people I'll learn kung fu Bruce Lee 
The best rhymes on the best labels
Doin shows with ??? and Prince Messiah on the tables 
Discussing politics with ??? and Malcolm
By chance Queen latifah brother Lance will do production on my album
Heaven tracks with heavenly rhyming
Jimmi Hendrix on guitar vocals by Phillis Hymen
Yes in my heaven my album will be a smash
Generating cash, serving rappers like off the ash
Flippin' in the sense of free voice, I can rejoice
Look over there its Heavy D's boy, Trouble T Roy!!
Hes kickin' dead stuff with Sammy Davis Junior
If I known heaven was Gonna be like this Ida been here sooner
Where heavenly emcees can be
No robbery, no thievery...
No police brutality for Eazy E
And all our love ones that passed away
Take it from me, some day we can all be free like Donnie Hathaway
I make the world feel my presence
Until I'm called back to the essence.
When I get to heaven....

Chorus

Its one for the physical
Its two for the spirit
Three for hip hop
That makes ya heads bob when you hear it
My minds in heaven and im lovin' it
No politicians, no government
No democrats, no republicans
And in the other men might create a civilisation
Where hip hop rules
The Emp the Raw rocks the nation
There's no stress in heaven we all relax
And real lyricists sign record contracts
Not these gun toting, blunt smoking
Cross over acts, lying on wax
Claiming they drop facts
Imagine possibly no animosity 
or malice, where your home is a palace
Sippin' wine from a golden chalice
Just loungin' and living lovely
No one above me, the very thought of it drugs me
Just like this track does me
In heaven people live there lives how they happen to live'em
No longer trapped in a prison
None of this capitalism, no need to boast squad
Even try to pose high, just give thanks and praise to the most high
And maybe we can all make it
And take it right back to the essence
When I get to heaven...</pre>
