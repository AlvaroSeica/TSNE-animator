[Science]
The Revelation
Yeah, yeah
Dave One hypnotic produciton (word up)
A-Trak on the cuts like a C-seciton (that's right)
Science on this mic
Got my man Eclipse and Logik
The Obscure massive, active, never passive

I want to see more justice
Denied the evil lurks amongst us
Went to college, earn the more raise than two A's
In alcoholic consumption (notions are)
Bent over backwards like contortion
You find niggas in portions, doing more bids than an auction
Lost and corrupted, they was instructed to leave my way split
Like mixed infants, to fix intent
Or employment of defined science was nonsense
Couldn't earn a raise like impotence (aaaaaaa)
Erase all traces, hope and grab them rappers hearts
Like a stethoscope, we'll let the cardiac arrest though
The revelation's right before you
Like them niggas that escaping from you
It's family ties you want to undo
Paraplegics on the run to
Wanting to rock the spot like a Hindu
One man who seeking monogamy
Held on to his words like apostrophe
But how it ought to be is never actualized 
Sick of rap guys with nine millies superior to their dick size

CHORUS {Science} [Logik]
{Between Fahrenheit or Celsius, no matter what your climate is
I filter your subconscious
Building my cipher from scratch with the sub zero temperatues
Genetically inclined to survive at all times
Because struggle means to hit you where the sun don't shine
'Cause hard times come a dime a dozen
Niggas front hard, inside streets but it really wasn't}
[Where they represented, heard niggas are irrigated(?)]
{Yeah son}
[Gassed up, they left heavily sedated]
{Word up}

[Eclipse]
Your physical frame will soon expire, my soul spits fire
With barricades trying to contain this live wire
Less religious but more effective than a chorus from church choir
I reach for power when zenith hits, and twelve strikes the hour
Now desire to meet the maker be coming
More greater than mediocre, shallow thoughts
Of making ends meet, with all the paper
See sooner or later, realizing we struggling for lesser
This life's a bitch and I'll undress her
I'd rather pour it on hard labour
To seek further advancement
With seconds forever changing like local news arrangements
Losing your faith, getting submerged under Watergate
And waterfalls, not even Dr. Kimble can escape
Now wait, and see with thought process
Brings amalgamation of oral ecstasy
My eyes are facing reality on many bases
'Cause it's W-A-R, in other words it's Armageddon

CHORUS

[Logik]
Come across a circle like a tangent line
And roll through underground like transit lines
And ???? minds, that you've got
On the streets having to greater in their souls
They heads, and gassed they suffocated
Frauds perpetrate to themselves with no, knowledge of it
They can't be out for ????, for lieu is way above it
I'm not out here to preach, but for the love of hip-hop
And it's strange when the coffins of my peers start to drop
From the ashes, of the lost come the answer like a lyric
But the knowledge doesn't hit my people as fast, as this epidemic
Ethnocentric like my click, crucify the gimmicks
We got no pretence when I reveal the sentence
In part two of this exposure, just like disclosure
The tragedy simply harasses, I push back my glasses
To see the faker rappers talking like Aretha wanting respect
But reflect, or look over your shoulder like in retrospect

CHORUS
