[Uncredited Female Chorus 3X]
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz
What makes you think huh, what makes you think huh
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz
What makes you think you could fuck with their figures

[Killa Sha]
My entourage. . .thirty guerillas at large
Dudes with nothing to lose that'll tear you apart
In to the beef as soon as it starts, mastered the art
I wore scars. . .be deep in dark
We turn cities into jungles and turn the clubs to the outback
Pressing my team yo I doubt that
I hear niggaz with the mouth, where your heart at
Rocking cold jewels dog you part that
So where you start at my nigga is where you spark that
And where it goes down par is where it's dark at
Hit everything that the red beam mark at
Send hot lead to your ice grill target
The realest in the mist put clips in guns and spit
Road call who the fuck you with
Triple O flagging in thirty below
Heat the room as soon as we blow squeezing the calico

[Chorus] (Killa Sha Chanting)
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (QB)
What makes you think huh, what makes you think (Bed-Stuy) huh
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (L.E.S)
What makes you think you could fuck with their figures (Park Hill)
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (Baisley)
What makes you think huh, what makes you think(Wagner)  huh
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (Brownsville)
What makes you think you could fuck with their figures

[Angel Dust]
Ayo witness, death picture it in graffic description
Twin mags what a fantastic invention
I had a lot of haters and half of them missing
I warned all them niggaz but half of them listened
I said I had guns that'll make you bend
Deflate you in, scrape you and shake you thin
You know how the love of the money can make you sin
Make you win make new angels take you in
I was in the same jail where they raped you in
Ran in your spot, where they duct taped you in
Put the gat to your ribs the mack to your kids
Spit at the same bars and went back to the crib
You know how I do, kidnap and hide you
Subtract the blood count throw you from a high roof
Yo it's Two-Five nigga we too live nigga
We won't stop bringing it Â‘til you die nigga

[Chorus] (Killa Sha Chanting)
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (Forty- P)
What makes you think huh, what makes you think (Pollo Grounds) huh
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (Edgemere)
What makes you think you could fuck with their figures (Soundview)
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (Hempstead)
What makes you think huh, what makes you think(Fort Greene)  huh
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (Tompkens)
What makes you think you could fuck with their figures

[Tragedy Khadafi]
If you ain't riding fall back with slow gas
I make thugs run up in the bank with no mask
Stick everything from the vault to the teller
The roof to the cellar the bread for the cheddar
Nigga, goodfella in an iceberg sweater
Plus my gat blow y'all should know better
For some reason my lines make thugs stronger
Blow guns and fuck for two hours longer
Y'all chase hoes while we chase dough
Lace with pesos hitting out of State hoes
You know how the gray go flooded with ice
Unconditional love cause we thugs for life
From a side where the grass ain't green it's black
Niggaz go to get sentence and booth their crack
Gon' juggle ready rock up in HDM
When I bubble hit the block in the grey BM

[Chorus] (Killa Sha Chanting)
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (Bridgeport)
What makes you think huh, what makes you think (Philly) huh
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (D.C)
What makes you think you could fuck with their figures (Boston)
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (Jersey)
What makes you think huh, what makes you think(Providence)  huh
What makes you think you could fuck with my niggaz (VA)
What makes you think you could fuck with their figures
