[Celph Titled]
The time has now come. When the Godz from all four corners of the Earth have combined
To form an entity unparalleled. Under gray skies where the sun is ashamed to shine
Shower their names from Hell's breath, with speech made of fire
be those who shall strike their wrath

[Celph Titled]
Motherfuckers better shut they mouth when the Godz spit rapid fire wisdom
Guns and grenades, my brigade consists of killin' henchmen
There ain't a nigga that's liver
I'm a Gun &amp; Ammo subscriber
That's quick to burn numerous holes through your Averex fibers
I'm on some rob shit, Cuban mafia conglomerates
Tommy nozzle spittin' hollows tips, lauchin' like rocket ships
I got glocks and clips and they're damn near ready to chase you
A bullet with your name on it, eager to kill and erase you
My Demigodz swordsmen are trained to slice precisely
You should question wifey, why your children look just like me
Come out the closet cause I know your whole crews fag
I saw 'em on the corner, rockin' rainbow colored doo rags
I rhyme fast and you just a bunch of slow herbs
You gettin' cuts and bruises trippin' over your own words
You better worship the barrel
Nigga my glock is holy
We fry your ass and serve you on a plate with guacamole
The mac don
My teeth cut through Teflon
I was raised draggin' bodies through the door sayin' "What's up mom?"
Niggas think I'm a vampire
I ain't seen the sun since it was set on fire
I'm the fuckin' second comin' of Messiah
My promo manager didn't know what he was in for
Come to your town, rob the cash register at my in-store
I know Muslims that would rather piss on the Koran in front of Farrakan
Then try to fuck with me when I get my battle on

[Esoteric]
This is mic mastery
I massacre men automatically
Rapidly bringin' tragedy to shatter Gray's Anatomy
Rhymin' like it's '89
I'm slashin' through your cavalry
With or without Apathy, I got the Demigodz in back of me
So cross me
You're get stabbed like Jesus's wrists
Cease and desist
Even sober cats be pleadin' the 5th
You bitches know who it is
I'm back from the dead
Your facts be off base like recovery crack heads
The heat speaker
With Celph Titled the beat freaker
My ? defy Silver Bullets like Bob Seger
To all God seekers
It's the end of the road
My sentence is gold
The venom in my pen will explode
Penance is old
I'll rhyme till I'm sick and disgusted
You'll go out with a bang like a chick in a snuff flick
I flow with the slang
Esoteric commands shit
Responsible for more head bustin'/bussin' then public transit

[Louis Logic]
Have you ever had a nightmare?
And you were at an open mic where
Your friends and family were watchin' through the bright lights glare
And I dare you to flow but
You woke up screamin' in pain
And quite scared
Only to find me standin' right there
A demon over your head
Leanin' over your bed
To lead you closer to death while you're dreamin' you overslept
I leisurely stole your breath like that kitten in Cat's Eye
I'm that sly
The Klan will start wishin' they're black guys
Tell your girl she should be slimmer then fat thighs
I slipped a disc in my back while I was hittin' it last night
And last I checked
The main theme of livin' the rap life is to snatch mics like I don't have mine yet
I want 1 for my man
2 Live on the stage
3 in the lab
4 is a surplus
And 5 on the page
I want my face on the TV in every home in the country
Till mom's so sick of seeing me she don't even want me

[Apathy]
You wanna battle for money
Well, I can spit it accapella
And probably make you drop Amil/a million like Rocafella
Cause tryin' to take away a mic from Ap when I'm spittin'
Is like Mya tryin' to wrestle Missy for a piece of chicken
My verses reverse Earth spinnin' on it's axis
Till wack rap acts wax stars spin it backwards
I-am-the-illest-rap-cat-out
Now play the record forward and try to figure it out
Yo, I'll snatch profits and chips until my pocket rips
While y'all race in space in fake rocket ships
If I stay on my computer then I'll start up the apocalypse
Simulating a nuclear war like Matthew Broderick
Ap
Used to be known for complex rap
Now I diss chicken heads like I'm Project Pat
Ladies I hypnotize till they let me lick their thighs
You can see those little heart shapes in those bitches eyes
I'm Don Juan, Es Caliente, Rico Suave
The Lone Ranger
Y'all are like Tonto, Kimosabe
Tryin' to diss the champ but you missed your chance
You got so shook on stage that you pissed your pants
My hand grips till my fists gets pistol cramps
You couldn't relax if your raps were mystic chants
Like "Oooommmm"
Tryin' to meditate or levitate
But make sure you standin' 50 feet back to detonate</pre>
