[voices talking: hot bukakke session... I mean seriously... 
how many fucking times do we have to go through this shit?]

[Cage]
I write left shit with my right spit on the mic twice 
sleep on beef wake up to hammers like christ
we summon electro animals destined a mandible
giant like we runnin through New York City in mechanical lions

[Aesop Rock]
Yo I walk on glass chuckle city out of a miners lung
grasshopper keep a civil tongue where the passifiers plugged
shrug em off eye of tiger pen over the hideous 
watch the gorilla in em slither back through the lineage

[Yak Ballz]
I write left shit with my right brain 
made eyeballs pop like bike chains in the right phase
dog,I got cat links connected to my arms like bat wings 
so each complete revolution of the bells is saddening

[El-P]
Weathermen is not a crew it's a hot mind with guns up to it 
the last cats audio to-in it ruinin' your drumkit
vandals of society arsonist sheep in public 
we speak in reality tv and there are no writers touchin it

[Tame One]
and if the brick city was Compton I'd be OG Bobby Johnson on the loose
throwin up deuce at the first sign of a problem
weathermen filth nastiest black and blue braid and light base milk with lumps 
bulked up for the last six months

[Yak Ballz]
yo the freak show veteran,bad to the skeleton 
I heard he's in the weatherman-oh god it's them again

[Cage]
a weatherman can do no wrong no uniform 
cut off three limbs with a new arm dead planet in its palm
flow some life in your rap one cross second
let me take you from your normally programmed shit record
if you're into irony I brought the four four in the place 
while canvas nights paint the art of war in your face
hit that psycho stimuli that gets you hot happy and whistlin' 
and if I'm too bugged the feds are still listenin'

[El-P]
you're flawed in the particles I'm a fuckin genuine article and you been reppin' shit marginal
partially I'm responsible I'm harsh to the bono and I'll acid wash your phono
I swagger the injury shield cloak 
a flock of humming birds circle the same place I spoke
arena hollowed out drunk bombshells fell through the smoke 
heal the pain of followers runnin through hell in shell toes

[Aesop Rock]
and the award for scummiest ninja moment of the summer
goes to mister slip a mickey to christ at his own supper
who's talent turned chemical imbalance to vital cash crop 
while moonlighting as your local Eckhart Pharmacy mascot
Boss Hogs dogs sniffin' out victims for the quota sorta rogue put a slip on the system throw the... 
WM's up for bounty hunters Paulie Junior mount the chrome bazookas on the Orange County Choppers

[Tame One]
Two dollar box cutters sharp with the game bustin through your cheek
you keep the change representative tang weatherman gang - stop
as the planet and the stars and the moons collapse 
it's this Cage, Aesop, El, Breeze Brew, Tame and Yak
pack it out early like winter for the brain
I'ma stop like fish dinners with a jar of bizarre for the dip spinach
the new left southpaws outlaws north to california 
represent bent and put dents in your battle armor</pre>
