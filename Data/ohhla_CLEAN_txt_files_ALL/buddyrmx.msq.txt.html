[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Now I don't want your number, nor your name, nor a dance
I don't want your time, or your sign, or a chance
Because I'm so cool, I'm so straight
Look I ain't tryna hit, and I don't want no date
Look this point in time, currently on my grind
And I don't want no distractions, yeah you do look fine
And your body is tight, ma, it might be right
But the vice not choosing, maybe music

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
It's FNF's vice, now you can be FNF's wife
or FNF's like, or FNF's in between
but that's were you reside when you ride wit the team
Captain known for dat rappin 'n' tings
Boy he fly without flapping his wings
Boy he high without dragging that green
And purple murder service with a dapper ass lean,
Chicago man is were my habitat's been
I don't think that I was born here I think that I was beamed
Furthermore, I think that I was clean
Chose the westside and then started MCing
Signed myself and then marketed me, on your radar now so pardon my ping
Look at your screen tell me what you see
Carrera lu, truely true, FNF UP</pre>
