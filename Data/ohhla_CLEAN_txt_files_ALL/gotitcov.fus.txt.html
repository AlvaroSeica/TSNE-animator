(Chorus)
we got it covered
we got it covered
we got it covered

open ya eyes surprise oh my gosh
who that kickin that wrap he's super
just like cat atthough ya knew that
the way we think is totally deranged
kickin shit that's strange unifying our brains
but holy moly it's the tall guy so make way
as I conquer my styles electrifying
I'll shock you more than blanka
it's factual supernatural now bust the actual
picture as I fix as you sink into my mixture
yeah my styles is deep so get ya dictionaries
I got ya name up on the frame from the obituary
my stylistic is futuristic also simplistic
pack wit protein plus more flavor than a
mystic juice produce a dr. like seuss
could it be I'm livin triple
fat just like the goose on ya mark set go!
yo let's get physical it's critical scientifical my mystical
style will sting ya like a poisonous bug
while I'm crashing threw ya wall like that kool-aid jug
I got it covered

(Chorus)

chalibde babadee yumpin yimawee yo gimme
the mike yikes I like jimmy cricket
watch me kick it hops an bust shots like
yosemite remember me mr. I'm using these fists for fury
hurry up put up ya (dukes)
it look like it's a fury kid alrught ya know it
yo it's the poet watch my flow
get quicker if ya try to rip the mic
yo I'm a see if it's the rooteness tooteness
giving you the boot and if ya riff
of ya gonna wanna I'm a comma shootin with
my ray gun say some way I comes wit
shit to make ya dizzy when I gets busy kid
and once it's said properly
I believe no topping me
no stopping me only barricades blocking me
cuz I'm back with back with hostyle
now watch I send dem niggaz running for
the bible scripts ducking bullets
now ya clutch ya crucifix: learned all
my style yep from the kung fu flicks
wanna battle area code 666
cause it's the napper rapper lyrics
slap ya jap ya clap on clap off after I freak the clapper
this nigga freaks it keep it on the hush
now peep it got curses my verses so your
fuck it beep it you herbs you heard the style
yes and the words I choose to use to bruise all crews
and kick them to curb yo!! it's a pity
ya itty bitty we ran the city from state to state
from pole to pole that hole kiddie committe got it covered

(Chorus)

now vacate the premises I'm knockin out teeth
so check ya dentisted my styles horrendous and tremendous
come wit more game than genesis
but some say my word play can get real
obnoxious, the funky way I kick it, I kick it wicked
ya dig it! yo yo yo! we got them swaying, smokin like a stogie
trying to bite our style cause we're in like vogue yes!
and we're comin wit the sheets, whole leap of techniques
brother way down yonder from depth's beneath
his signs are weakening, damn no pulse!
I think that he's dead, we're losing him
ahh fuck it just cover his head, we got it covered

(Chorus)</pre>
