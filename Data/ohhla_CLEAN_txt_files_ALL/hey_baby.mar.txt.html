[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
I've been gone awhile away from you when I hope you overstand
That I got to do what I must do to be a better man
Cause if I was just to act a fool do nothing for myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed my world would be crumbling
It's a joy when I siiiit down and think cause of the good things that we have
And what we do to make it through when the good turns into bad
Well I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't fuss because I mist go do what I must do

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bury my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
A time and space a different place a perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows you be that widow tree
And I could never bail and thought of you not by my side
So I would be the one to tell you be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny
I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry you know I must do what I must do

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bury my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

[Bridge: Stephen Marley] (Mos Def)
Well then it's not easy, Jah knows I have tried I tried
So don't you get weary (Oh God) Jah knows I tried

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
And God knows, that life is one big road
With alot of signs and turns and twist and curves
Even though the road is rocky
But maintain to ride and keep on rockin
From, city to city backyard to yard
And we, be seein the cites standin under the lights
And the spot is hot it's cold and lonely at nights
And I'm feenin and I'm dreamin and I'm holdin you tight
But hold on, every single road I rode on
Come to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry
Cause nobody knows and it's no bye bye bye
And our love don't die with the passin of time
It just grow more, it just keep strong
And even though I'm gone I ain't movin too far
Your the light through the dark shinnin right through my heart
So my journey just start

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bury my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

[Outro: Stephen Marley]
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bury my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains</pre>
