[Intro: Eternal Love]
Ha ha ha ha ha~!
Eternal Love, Diabolic
Third World Order, Rebel Army
It's all mental
This is the rebels mentality - always in the zone
Ready to go hand to hand, yo lock and load
This is the rebels mentality - fight for freedom in my home
Do this for my people and the babies gettin grown
This is the rebels mentality

[Eternal Love]
Morphing necklace around my neck and tomahawks in my hands
A column sang that when I'm speakin, Korean
They give the hurt, when they're tearin, through your skin
As if you're a wall safe, and I'm breakin in
I'll grab your mind and I take it, mode will spin
Take you to the end of time just to re-begin
They look at me and say that I'm walkin in sin
But I go to war so they don't have to and I fight to win
I can see it and do it, but I can't explain it though
I can see through the matrix and can re-arrange the code
So fuck what they doin out of Bohemian Groves
I'm like the +Full Metal+ I don't gotta use any circles
I'm a front line general, re-arrangin the chemicals
In your city bloke givin the third a better flow
So you can open up your eyes
or we can break the oppresion on you they hold

[Chorus]
This is the rebels mentality - always in the zone
Ready to go hand to hand, yo lock and load
This is the rebels mentality - fight for freedom in my home
Do this for my people and the babies gettin grown
This is the rebels mentality - take you to a higher state
This is guerilla warfare, doing whatever it takes
This is the rebels mentality - always raisin the stakes
Cause we're always makin moves to change this place
The rebels mentality

[Diabolic]
Fuck cops, go to war with police
And force them to eat their guns when their fortress is breached
Attackin like it's Normady and we're stormin the beach
Afterwards 'Bolic's goin for the corporate elite
Kick the door with my feet 'til I, break it in half
Lawn mower blades spinnin for the snakes in the grass
40's and Timbs, fuck the champagne in your glass
Son of a gun, pops told me aim and just blast
Ain't chasing the cash and spittin vaginal raps
I just make songs based on actual facts
Tearing through your flesh, where the fuck my cannibals at~?
Slaughter sheep with the wolves in this animals pact
Attackin the track, every time I go in the booth
An inspiration when moral is gettin low in the troops
Told the recruits, I would rather choke from a noose
than accept being lied to, so I'm exposin the truth

[Chorus]</pre>
