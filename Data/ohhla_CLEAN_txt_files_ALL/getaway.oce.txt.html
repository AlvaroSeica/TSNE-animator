[O.C.]
Yeah.. all the leeches, bloodsuckers
From y'all I {got to get away.. from this}
I got to {get away.. from this}
My man Marley got to {get away.. from this}
Uhh, my man Stan got to {get away} from this
Inebriated, check, yo

Stay away from saboteurs, haters yappin they jaws
Users abusers leakin off before they own cause
There be some shruggin off, losin some pluckin off
Bitches who think I owe 'em cause my dick they suckin off
Takin my kind for weakness, it's time my mind I speak
If you feel it's not about you then no offense when you receive this
If you my peeps ignore this, this here recording's for those
no longer involved, they dead and stink to me like rigormortis
Show me the love when I'm up, not ass-out
Don't leave me no thoughts for doubt, cause that's not what I'm about
True lies came to life, let me wrong I made it right
Shook off, I took off, from those holdin me back
I had to

[Chorus]
{get away.. from this} schemin and plottin
Havin dreams of knockin me off
Got to {get away.. from this} I shook off
I took off, from those me holdin back
I had to {get away.. from this} schemin and plottin
Havin dreams of knockin me off
I got to {get away.. from this} I shook off
I took off, from those me holdin back

[O.C.]
Yeah, I'm like Patti LaBelle with a new attitude
New years upon us, eye on the prize with new rules
Lames leave 'em behind there's, peace on my mind
I'm feelin good with y'all I'm just sharin a piece of my mind
The dead weight, I'm lettin go of, no draggin me down
For dolo O on my dolo, never cry tears of a clown, I'm solo
Can't use me for photos, the chrome was too {?}
The stance, too advanced, your own shit, niggaz is homos
My scanners beep, when thieves in sight, Jesus Christ
Dickrider I seen him the previous night
True lies let me wrong before, I made it right
Shake off, I take off, speakin my mind out loud
I got to

[Chorus]

[O.C.]
Yeah, now, always been self-contained, never been a beggin Billy
I'd rather be broke than ball when these niggaz kill me
They throw it in your face, any given time or place
Time of day, fraudulent friendship and it finally came
out in the open now I know it you was never peoples
Evil done reared it's ugly face in the form of Azazel
Talkin my brother's keeper, wifey made me a believer
She said these niggaz be bloodsuckers like vampires
Supplied shelter to strays but, no more will I succumb
to pity and cave in at Days Inn
Seein lies come to life, let me wrong, I made it right
Shook off, I took off, from niggaz holdin me back
I had to

[Chorus]</pre>
