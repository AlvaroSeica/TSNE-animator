I knew you was fuckin' around
Playing all innocent and hoing since the foundation
Don't make have to pound his thin crown face in
And risk being jammed up like traffic inbound from space in
There's been a place for you in my heart since we first met
A teenage love and didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put all my chips on the worst bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You coulda broke it off and ended it and dipped
And if you spoke soft coulda still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize that's why they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power

Probably kissed me that same evening I should be hurling
Matta fact, gimme back my bracelet and my stearling
I rather waste it or give it for ya girlfriend
She did let me stab it last week while you was working
Remember our vacation out to Maryland?
I dooked the maid Carolyn
She made me throw the towel in
Like all fool men the times I hit ya moms off
I told her knock it off
But she had to set the rocket off
Ain't enough room in thi fuckin' town
When you see thin head
Tell 'em be duckin' down
I'm not rompin' around
He better be armed ready and prepared
To be stomped in the ground
