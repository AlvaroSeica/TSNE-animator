[Nikki Diaz]
So, many fools just
Talkin' 'bout, what they got
Talkin' 'bout, what they do
But I know that's not, you
You a pimp, you a player
You a baller, you a thug

[Fingazz]
{*fading in*}
"Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-Fingazz on the track"

Chorus: Nikki Diaz
So, many fools just
Talkin' 'bout, what they got
Talkin' 'bout, what they do
But I know that's not, you
You a pimp, you a player
You a baller, you a thug
I can see it in your eyes
That you really livin' like that

[Down]
(Verse 1)
Live like a boss, homie
It ain't no fantasy
Chevy on them 13"s, truck on them 23"
Plus three
And got the DVD and TV's
In every seat
And on the screen, you gonna see me
Yeah
I'm doin' big thangs
Brown Superman
But I traded in the cape for a pinky ring
And now, I'm shinin'
Di-did it off on rhymin'
Heavy, I'm on (?)
Used to be from crimin'
Back in the day, playing Gangsta Games
Them gangsta ways, keep gettin' this gangsta paid
You know I'm always talkin' (?)
Now I'm in a showbiz
Winning cause I always put my money where my mouth is

Repeat Chorus Twice

Hook: Nikki Diaz
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (Be about it, 'bout it)
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (Be about it, 'bout it)
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (Be about it, 'bout it)
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (Be about it, 'bout it)

(Verse 2)
You see these girls to the side of me
That's the way I roll
Bad mamacitas everywhere I go
Oh!
But at the club, gonna probably find some new ones
Weeding out the rats, buying shots for the true ones
I'm not a pimp like Don Magic Juan
Just a player with a limp, call me Down Mage Juon
Soy Mexicano
Y muy chingon
I'm spitting game to two heinas, plus one on the phone
Hey!
We gonna rendez-vous
Having some menage-a-trois
Make 'em French kiss up in a Penthouse bar
It's on
Hey dawg, it's crazy how my life is
Ain't no funny busi' (Ha ha)
But I love it cause my mouth is where my money is

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Nikki Diaz]
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (Be about it, 'bout it)
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (Be about it, 'bout it)
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (Be about it, 'bout it)
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (I can tell that you)
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (Be about it)
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (Be about it, 'bout it)
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (I can tell that you)
Don't, talk about it
Be about it (Be about it, dirty)
So, many fools just
Talkin' 'bout, what they got
Talkin' 'bout, what they do
But I know that's not, you</pre>
