Yo, it's that time, we bring the past back up
Ya boy Skillz, you know my ass gon' act up
And this year was jacked up, but I got the facts up
Here we go, Scrap - this the "'08 Rap Up"
If you a Patriots fan, you was quick to cheer
'Til the Giants pulled off the "Upset of the Year"
And the commercials was lame as hell
Poor Marion Jones, she had to watch the game from her cell
"Detox" was gettin recorded
and Dre put out some headphones, but he was the only one that could afford 'em
Wayne got bagged for havin herb
and Nas try to drop a CD that was called the N-word
I chilled on the word, I was fine
'til I saw him at the Grammys, I was like, "This nigga lost his mind!"
Ne-Yo toured with Kells, and he got played
50 Cent, he kicked Paris Hilton off stage
Game went to jail for eight days
You know it's bad when JoJo faint and K-Ci leave him on the stage
Jay-Z and Mary J. doubled they bread
Shout out to Prodigy and Remy Ma, hold ya head
"A Raisin in the Sun?" You lied
I heard that and I thought Flavor Flav got a show outside
And wrestling look faker than ever
I mean, WHO was gon' believe the Big Show couldn't beat Mayweather?!
Now Nick &amp; Mariah, they kept it G
But the "Wedding of the Year" goes to Hov &amp; B
The unity in G-Unit is gone
'cause it's a sad day when you got Young Buck cryin on the phone
("I'm just being confused!")
Ice-T and Soulja Boy - dumb!
And who was the fool that threw a bottle at KRS-One?!
The Sean Bell verdict was lame
And 50 went to Africa but he ain't come back with his chain
Wayne dissed the DJs', what was that 'bout?
Then the barber from L.A. straight knocked Suge out
Tough street +Lookin' Boy,+ the guys that made that song
They lookin like no second single +Lookin' Boys+
And lemme say this, don't it feel good
to say BIG UPS - TO ALL MY HAAATERS!!
The beef gotta stop, G
Fif', you runnin out of people man why you pickin on Rocsi?
The "Baby Mama" came out
And we ain't never find out who really burned down the house
Rick Ross took it too far
Was it me, or he was the biggest C.O. that we seen thus far?
I'm just askin 
and Bow Wow got his ass handed to a him in a game of Madden
You wanna know what's funny? (What?)
They showed this to Game, but they ain't never say who got that money
Heh, the system is filthy, for real G
How the hell R. Kelly come up not guilty?
I can't believe he walkin, on TV
Talkin 'bout ("When you say teenager, how old are we talking?")
Wayne sold +A Milli+ in a week
and in seven days, I got sick of the "A Milli" beat
Da Brat doin time served
And '08, was almost a good year for ya man Yung berg
Between fights and his fanbase, he needed some help
Then his chain went on tour, by itself
Will Smith got Hollywood on smash
Puff, you a millionaire man, why you cryin 'bout gas?
Katt Williams, he went nuts
and the econmoy was harder than McCain tryin to put his arms up
And Palin, I ain't gon' discuss her
Heh, she prol'ly on the porch now, tryin to look at Russia
And Kanye, he went for broke
Maybe the album should've been called, "808 and No High Notes"
Heh, naw he doin his thang
Is it hard to fight paparazzi when you got on skinny jeans?
Nelly and Usher couldn't find their fans
Superhead said, "I'm pregnant" - I'm like by who, the pregnant man?!
T.I. got back in gear
Beyonce "Single Ladies" - mmm, "Video of the Year"
Heh, it had the guys gettin hyped together
I hope DMX finally get his life together
Man, we got to kill all the drama
Biggest moment EVER - Barack Obama ("Yes, we can!")
First black president, please believe it
I'm just happy that my granny got a chance to see it
It's time for a change
So don't gon' try to turn the inauguration into a All Star Game
Let's act right, and show these kids
We can turn "Yes, we can!" into "Yes, we did!"
And Bush made it hard
Be patient, let that man go into the White House and do his job
Black athletes, y'all gotta parle
Don't play, you saw how they came back for O.J.
The economy, that's a wrap no doubt
The whole world in debt, how the hell you bail that out?
Halle Berry, she had a baby on the low
The best thing on TV was Keyshia Cole show
Lookin good, Keyshia, but don't thank me
You ain't the star of the show, that would be Frankie
("HOLLAAAAAAAAAAAAH!" "Man down!")
It's a +Crazy World+, Jeezy told ya son
"Crazy World?" I wonder where he got that from?
I gotta say it, 'cause he influenced the game
but I gotta give props to the boy T-Pain
And y'all in his lane
with songs like ("OHHHHHHHH!!!!! We pop champagne!")
So I'ma say this quick - (We in a recession!)
Stop lyin, y'all ain't poppin shhhh!
And President Bush so hated
He wnet to Iraq and almost got a-shoe-sinated
Heh, so I'ma shout out to board
And shout out to err'body upstairs who ain't wit us no more
So y'all stay on your grind
Ya boy Skillz, welcome to the two-thousand and nine
(NINE!! NINE! Nine! nine!)</pre>
