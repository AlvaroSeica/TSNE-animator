[Intro] [Kanye talking]
You rap. I'm gonna rap the way I rap. Youknowhatimsayin'?
And we gonna murder these niggas. Kan man product c'mon. Andy C where you at?

[Chorus] [Kanye West]
I hit the block on ten in a drop top Benz
You can go against the guns but the glocks gon' win
Lyrically killin' y'all niggas but
"I sweat it live
Is he gonna live doc?
No. The nigga died." - Ol' Dirty Bastard 'Hippa To The Hoppa'

[Verse One]
[Kanye West]
If they don't know, let's learn 'em
Rhymefest burn 'em

[Rhymefest]
To the ground like Waco
Fake hoe
Take yo
Ass back to the drawing board
Where the chalk at?
Used to have a lot to say
Where the talk at?
Speak your heart
Don't mumble under your breath
I caught that
You a thug now
Back in high school we never fall back
Punked out
Jumped out, basically
Hoes is like, "Ewww get away from me."
They was chasin' me
And it's still the same
I'm still the same
You still a lame
You know how that song go
"Some things will never change"
Some niggas will never grow like Emmanuel Lewis
And while you fightin' for respect bitches is handin' it to us
So when
I'm arrivin'
Guns risin'
Niggas join the swim team, start divin'
The streets is hot
Police yo block
Like Prudential, all these smokers want a piece of the rock
Uhhh
And all these hoes want a piece of the cock
And all these haters gonna get is a piece of the glock
I'm the reason ain't no motherfuckin' peace on the block
And I ain't Q-Tip but I'll make your breathin' stop/+Breathe &amp; Stop+

[Chorus] [Kanye West] [x2]
I hit the block on ten in a drop top Benz
You can go against the guns but the glocks gon' win
Lyrically killin' y'all niggas but
"I sweat it live
Is he gonna live doc?
No. The nigga died." - Ol' Dirty Bastard 

[Verse Two] [Kanye West]
From the front to the back, where my thugs at?
My niggas love that
Gun talk, I talk, now everyone choke
Cause I came with it
Some ain't with it
Niggas get money maine, some can't get it
Everybody wanna be what Kanye West be in
In the bulletproof 5 what the Pres be in
With a half black, half white lesbian
But you
Minimum wage like a Mexican
My guns don't discriminate, they penetrate
Y'all niggas don't get hype, you hyperventilate 
So before you take your last breath any last statements?...

[Kanye West talking]
Man, this nigga Fest said,
"I ain't Q-Tip but I'll make your breathin' stop/+Breathe &amp; Stop+".
Man, I can't come with no line after that man.
Just bring this shit back in, c'mon man.

[Chorus] [Kanye West] [x2]
I hit the block on ten in a drop top Benz
You can go against the guns but the glocks gon' win
Lyrically killin' y'all niggas but
"I sweat it live
Is he gonna live doc?
No. The nigga died." - Ol' Dirty Bastard 

[Verse Three] [Rhymefest]
You the type to run into a party, already tooted up
Can't get in?
So you run, get a strap and shoot it up
Mad cause you not looted up
Hoes said, "He wasn't cute enough."
Tried his damnedest
Couldn't do enough
Fuck star stats, we still car jack
Hit it up
Runnin' through the man who flashin' that leather
Give it up
My Taurus like to spark a lot
He ain't a player he just talk a lot
We whupped his ass in the parkin' lot
Hopped back in the truck and lit the dutch
Now he on the ground lookin' double jointed as fuck
It's the R-H-Y
Fuck tryin' to spell it
I live it how I tell it
Get hoes like Tom Selleck
My clip gets hollow tips yours takes pellets
Sayin' my weed fly and I can't even smell it
I can see why you broke
Punk nigga
My car is paid off
You a month to month nigga
I roll with I-don't-care-throw-him-in-the-trunk niggas
Roll up to your high school just to jump niggas
Pussy ass niggas

[Chorus] [Kanye West] [x6]
I hit the block on ten in a drop top Benz
You can go against the guns but the glocks gon' win
Lyrically killin' y'all niggas but
"I sweat it live
Is he gonna live doc?
No. The nigga died." - Ol' Dirty Bastard</pre>
