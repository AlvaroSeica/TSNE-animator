Hmm
Alright (*kissing sound*)
Yeah

[Mariah Carey] (Ja Rule)
I never thought (Who would've thought baby)
Thought I'd be (Missin' you baby)
Without you (I need you baby)
Why me (Why me)
I never thought (Who would've thought baby)
Thought I'd be (Missin' you baby)
Without you (I need you baby)
Why me (Why me)

[Ja Rule]
Love, want your body next to me
On me actually
Off that ecstasy
Reminiscin' how we used to smoke and freak
{Fuck} and fall asleep, lockin' for a week
Now we barely even talk and walk the block
Kiss and cuddle up
Girl we losin' touch
What's a man to do but go crazy babe
I know you're mad but you don't really hate me babe
It's deeper than that, now

1-   [Mariah Carey]
     And baby if we got together again
     Sugar I would be your very best friend
     I would love you unconditionally
     You'll never want to let me go baby
     I promise I will be by your side
     I will give you anything you need to get by
     Then my broken heart will finally mend
     Baby if we got together again

[Nate Dogg]
Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend
What if I had a chance to do it all again
Sometimes for happiness we hesitate
Just like the game I hear the love won't wait
What if I had another best friend
What if I had someone on who I could depend (me)
Someone who makes me feel like you used to
Tell me babe what would you do

Repeat 1

2-     [Mariah Carey] (Ja Rule)
       And baby if we got together again (Who would've thought baby)
       Sugar I would be your very best-friend (Missing you baby)
       I will love you unconditionally (I need you baby)
       You will never want to let me go baby (Why me)
       I promise I will be by your side (Who would've thought baby)
       I will give you anything you need to get by (Missing you baby)
       Then my broken heart could finally mend (I need you baby)
       Baby if we got together again (Why me)

[Ja Rule]
Why would you wanna go through the pain
Of loving another man
The truth is nobody can love you like I can
It's a damn shame
We can't get along
We used to get it on
Where'd it all go wrong
I admit the flesh is weak but the game is strong
We go my way, your way, baby we movin' on
It's true, gon' miss you
Who would've thought, I'd be without you

[Mariah] (Ja Rule)
I never thought (Baby there's nothin' to lose)
Thought I'd be (You know my soul's so cold)
Without you (And my love is pain)
Why me, why me (Spit it one more time)
I never thought (My baby)
Thought I'd be (Pride and joy)
Without you (I'ma make you mine)
Why me (No doubt, Rule)

Repeat 1

Repeat 2 to fade</pre>
