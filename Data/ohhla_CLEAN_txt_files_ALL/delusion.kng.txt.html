Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[King Lil G]
Smoking on that California shit
It'll have you delusional than a muthafucka
Ak47 mob homicide

[Chorus]
(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
Better roll that up
Better roll that up
(In ecstasy)
I bet the beat bang
Better let the beat bang
[x2]

[Verse 1]
I told you before
I'm delusional
Not having weed to smoke
Is unusual
And I got a couple girls
At the studio
And you know that
They fucken with the sucios
Haven't been home
In about 2 days
Super blown to the dome
On a late Tuesday
Had to put it down
For my new mixtape
To my fans in l.a
All the way to u.k
Bitches be fucken with feelings
But I gotta go
When you think about
Gotta go &amp; do another show
Maybe out in Portland
Pasco, tri-cities
I remember baby girl with the nice titties
Rest in peace to my homeboy fiz
All my natives smokin' to this
Tell my haters
Not to slit your wrist
Cause the beat go bang
Like I emptied a clip

[Chorus]
(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
(Floatin' in ecstasy)
Smokin' on that bomb shit
Smokin' on that bomb shit (bomb shit)

(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
(Floatin' in ecstasy)
Smokin' on that bomb shit (bomb shit)

(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
(Floatin' in ecstasy)
Smokin' on that bomb shit
Smokin' on that bomb shit (bomb shit)

(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
(Floatin' in ecstasy)
Smokin' on that bomb shit
Smokin' on that bomb shit

[Verse 2]
I do it for all of my soldiers
Bandana tied
Like I'm suppose to
I'm giving my enemies no love
I just chill &amp; smoke doja
Tell these rappers
I don't wanna make songs with em
I don't fuck with em
I don't run with em
Ak47 got momentum
If a hater talk shit
Put a hole in em
Half ounce of that skywalker
You talk shit
But we rhyme harder
You silly suckas
You try harder
Bang bang bang
You die harder
We come from the streets
Gun in the streets
Watch your muthafucken mouth
When you fucken with beef
Smoke in my lungs
Kush in my blunt
King lil g
That tattood gunz
From l.a. to the bay
West coast shit I rep all day
High to the sky
Till I can't think straight
Rep for the whole mob
That ak
Pull up to the party
Tatted all over the body
And smokin' on the sticky
And the crowd is super rowdy
Everybody lookin' at my girl
Cause she's a hottie
Gotta let the beat bang
Like its shots from the shotty

[Chorus]
(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
(Floatin' in ecstasy)
Better roll that up
Better roll that up
[x2]

(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
(Floatin' in ecstasy)
I bet the beat bang
Better let the beat bang

(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
(Floatin' in ecstasy)
Smokin' on that bomb shit
Smokin' on that bomb shit

Smokin' on that bomb
Smokin' on that bomb shit

(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
(Floatin' in ecstasy)
(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
(Floatin' in ecstasy)
(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
(Floatin' in ecstasy)
(I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy)
(Floatin' in ecstasy)</pre>
