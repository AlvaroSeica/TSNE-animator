[Chorus]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
and now we get the pay back
The pay back, the pay back

[Verse One]
Champagne kisses, hold me in your
lap of lux-ury
I only want to fly first-class desires
You're my limousine
So elegant, the way we ride
Our passion, it just multiplies
There's platinum lightning in the sky
Look I'm livin' like a queen

This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, ba-by
We're luxurious, like E-gyptian cotton
We're so rich in love, we're rollin, in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly

[Chorus]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
and now we get the pay back
The pay back, the pay back

[Slim Thug]
Slim Thugaaaa..
I made my stacks now I finally get to lay back (to lay back)
I worked so hard now I finally get the payback (the payback)
and blaze sex, ridin in back of da Maybach (chyea) (Maybach)
If it ain't dro', I say no, we don't play that (play that)
I'm in my house like a Boss reclined
Bumpin on da sticky green, sippin on me some wine (some wine)
I made it out the hood and I'm feelin real good about
Ridin' in the Benz tryna pull the wood up out (chyea)

This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, ba-by
We're luxurious, like E-gyptian cotton.

[Chorus 2X]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
and now we get the pay back
The pay back, the pay back

[Bridge]
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We're loaded and we're not gonna blow it
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We're hooked up with the love cause we grow it
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We got hydroponic love and we're smokin'
Cha-CHIIIIING, cha-CHIIIING
We burn it, you and I, we are so lit

We're so rich in love, we're rollin, in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly

[Chorus]
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
and now we get the pay back
The pay back, the pay back

[background overlaps chorus]
This is how we roll..
So luxurious..
Baby we are so...ex-pen-sive...oh..
