[Intro]
{*laughter*} (She don't want liquor, she just my kind)
Corey got another one mayne
All I know mayne (boss bitch man)
Ferrari Boyz, for life (at the bar)

[Waka Flocka Flame]
She don't want liquor, she just want wine
She just my kind - long hair, fat behind
They say we're intertwined, we belong together
In the club throwin money up, changin weather
G's on my sweater, all I get is cheddar
Money go-getters, Waka Flocka and 2 Timez - that's Gucci
"Sup?" I say to the Haitians, whattup Lucci?
Free my nigga Zoe, 40K for a show
Practice what I preach, shorty man that's all I know
Triple cup styrofoam's got me walkin slow
I'm smokin on reefer
Me, Gucci, and Wiz Khalifa

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Smokin on reefer
Make a bitch out a believer
Comin through your speaker
Grind in my two-seater
Cause I got a fleet-a
Send 'em work like it ain't a leaker
I practice what I preach-a
If you ain't got game, I could teach ya

[Gucci Mane]
I got a murder charge now for the tracks I murdered
Like a nigga turned around, I'm goin back to work
Got a smirk on my face cause I smoke the purp
Just kilt your boy, now they doin a search
And I ain't been lame, but tame your dame
Cause you should be ashamed how she's off the chain
I'm insane in the brain like Saddam Hussein
I got a brink of extra change off this extra 'caine
It's crazy, Dwayne just countin strange
Me and Waka Flocka Flame on a private plane
With two bad-ass bitches, bout to run a train
Like an organ donor, baby loaned the brain

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
