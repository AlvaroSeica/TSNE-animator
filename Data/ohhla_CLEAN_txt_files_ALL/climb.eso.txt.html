Song:   Climb These Cliffs
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I don't know why the sky is blue
I don't know why I write these tunes
But with a vibe like this
I'm a climb these cliffs
So I'll be there for you

Well, how you doin' bro
What's up man
Chillin', I'm cool
It's hot as hell
I'm thinkin' 'bout takin'
A dip in a pool
Fuckin' nice
I'm 'bout to hit the beach
And roll me a fatty
And grab a case of that cold shit
You know where to catch me

Welcome to the jungle by the beach
Where the sea sounds gorgeous
Three night owls been cookin'
In their treehouse fortress
With them fresh herbs
Bet the whole pound got blazed
Escape that nine to five
Perpetual groundhog day
We just glide off the runway
Charge tracks like far laps
Smell another steak
When I step out on the tarmac
Convertible cruisers
In a tropical summer
We don't have all the answers
But we got one another

And these warm waters
Have broken up my colder days
On a piece of driftwood
Soaking up these solar rays
My god, this works
To revert that old feeling
My own therapeutic version
Of the soul healing
My crib's crew
I'm chillin' rhyme in my igloo
My music mediterranean
Come dive in this big blue
Bohemian balcony
Bliss been bent with absinthe
I stroll through my life
Like a Jim Henson Labyrinth
Walk with me

I don't know why the sky is blue
I don't know why I write these tunes
But with a vibe like this
I'm a climb these cliffs
So I'll be here for you

I don't know why the sky is blue
I don't know why I write these tunes
But with a vibe like this
I'm a climb these cliffs
So I'll be there for you

Hey yo, I'm fresh out the woodworks
Carvin' a masterpiece
Painting a paradise of audio archery
The paper plane architect
Stoned on a house boat
Reporting live from
Our home in the South Brook
Turn off your televisions
Walk with me, talk with me
Behold the elements
Palm trees and pelicans
So climb cliffs
When they place those bricks
Get up, hold your head up
And don't take no shit
'cause today, I ain't got a
Worry in the world
I'm that local...
... with my girl
Little finger in the air
Like throw a dog a bone
'cause Macka ain't an actor
I'm a poet on a throne

I'm a christmas f**king carol
I'm a lonely night on a beach
I'm a simple Dutch
And I'm a complex brother
With motherf**kin' A.D.D.

And I don't know
Why I roll like this
I don't know why my soul exists
And I don't know
If I told you this
But you can bet your bottom dollar
Brother, I'll be there for you

I don't know
Why I roll like this
I don't know why my soul exists
And I don't know
If I told you this
But you can bet your bottom dollar
Brother, I'll be there for you

I don't know why the sky is blue
I don't know why I write these tunes
But with a vibe like this
I'm a climb these cliffs
So I'll be there for you

I don't know why the sky is blue
I don't know why I write these tunes
But with a vibe like this
I'm a climb these cliffs
So I'll be there for you</pre>
