And when my fears arise, I blow 'em out, blow 'em out, get it out

[Verse 1]
Death creeps through the streets over programmed beats
A rabid dog in heat on a dead end street
Oil slicks, the only rainbows that canvas gray concrete
Shadows of skyscrapers fall when Mohammed speaks
Corpses piled in heaps placing tags on feet
A Nike Air Force Fleet custom made, unique
Still in box white sheet, white tank top, wife beat
Ripened blue, black, sweet

[Chorus]
Hearts in two-step beat...break 
Dance pray work whip... break 
Neck jump back kiss... break
Ashes, dust, kill, crush... break

[Verse 2]
Consider yourself: less than, inferior to
half man, superior to woman, unbearable likeness
Consider yourself: almost, never quite, dark-skinned
lily white, black as sin, devils den, whiteness
Consider yourself: outcast, criminal, unseen
invisible, point blank, ready cocked trigger
Consider yourself: Hardcore, dirt poor, hustler
BITCH, whore, reverend, doctor, nigger

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Hearts in two-step beat... break 
Dance pray work whip... break 
Neck jump back kiss... break
Ashes, dust, kill, crush... break

Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out, beat 
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out, beatings
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out, beats
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out, beasts
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out, get it out 
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out 
By the horns and get it out, cough it up and spit it out, get it out
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out
Break the cycle, break the chain, break the hurt and break the pain
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out
All my doubts and all my fears, break the spell that keeps me here
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out
Break the cycle, break the chain, break the whip and break the pain, get it out 
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out
Spit, spit, spit it out, get it out... break
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out, break
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out, break
Let it out, blow it out, spit it out... get it out, break</pre>
