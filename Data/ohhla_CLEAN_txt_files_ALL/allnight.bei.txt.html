Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm B-E-I M-A-E-J-O-R
I'm B-E-I M-A-E-J-O-R

She's just a fly ass girl
Livin' in a sexy world
I told her jump in my Benz
We can go anywhere

Yeah, unh
So baby what chu on
What chu drinkin'
I know what chu want
You winkin'
I'm thinkin'
That maybe we should hook it up
'Cause girl my futures lookin up
You know, fraternize
Look it up
She don't know what that word mean
But she don't give a damn she thirsty
But she heard I'm buyin' out bars like I'm openin' a gym
All the girls hollerin' out "that's him"
I'm rich boy
Throw some D's on it
These kicks boy
Cost about seven hundred
Hands up in the sky
Let the party go all night

'Cause we feel, we feel, alright
The weekends finally here
So we gon', party on, all night
So come on everybody
Put your hands up, hands up
Gon' and lose control
If you gonna go all night, all night
'Cause we feel, we feel, alright
So we could make it go all night

We got white people, goin loco
Spanish people, Acapulco
Black people, wearin' gold though
Out in Dallas, Tony Romo
Prime time, I'm Deion Sanders
Good guy, I'm Mr. Flanders
Going nuts I fuck the Planters
As I say, "I'm going hammer"
Take this shot then take a gander
Man this party goin' stupid
Man this shit is like a movie
Get down like somebody shootin'
'Cause you look so good
And I wish I could
Get to my crib
And we can go all night

'Cause we feel, we feel, alright
The weekends finally here
So we gon', party on, all night
So come on everybody
Put your hands up, hands up
Gon' and lose control
If you gonna go all night, all night
'Cause we feel, we feel, alright
So we could make it go all night

She's just a fly ass girl
Livin' in a sexy world
I told her jump in my Benz
We can go anywhere

'Cause we feel, we feel, alright
The weekends finally here
So we gon', party on, all night
So come on everybody
Put your hands up, hands up
Gon' and lose control
If you gonna go all night, all night
'Cause we feel, we feel, alright
So we could make it go all night</pre>
