(Intro, Unnamed female)
Muhfucka got me fucked up, playin but I ain't payin
I ain't shakin my ass for shit
Talkin bout you a muhfuckin balla, so drop it off

(Hook, unnamed female)
I need my sackful, I need my sackful
I need my sackful, I need my sackful
I need my sackful, I need my sackful
I need my bills paid, I need my sackful
So where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy

(Verse 1, Project Pat)
These girls askin for that grip, and they screamin it
Better pay for that dance or you ain't SHIT, and she meaning it
They want that money more than dick, and she fiending it
Promethazine in my Sprite, I'm leaning it
I'm lookin like a million bucks, these bitches lookin for bucks
Fuckin all these niggas pockets, treatin these niggas like sluts
I'm screamin pimpin while I'm tippin, cause I'm bout that bread
I asked shawty bout that head, this is what she said...

(Hook, unnamed female)
I need my sackful, I need my sackful
I need my sackful, I need my sackful
I need my sackful, I need my sackful
I need my bills paid, I need my sackful
So where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy

(Verse 2, Nasty Mane)
All these twenties, bank roll look like a phone book
If y'aint tippin, stand back, you just came to look
She want them dollars on the spot, fuck a check book
I feed these hoes long dick, no cook book
She got my name on her ass, that's a good look
I swear she got some super head, she gon' write a book
She on that paper-talk game, got that nigga hooked (He a lame)
Slidin down that pole like a fire chief
Pussy poppin for that cheddar, she about her cheese
She Down-South thick, but she from out East
Whole body tatted up, a ghetto masterpiece
She all about her guap, she speaking guapanese

(Hook, unnamed female)
I need my sackful, I need my sackful
I need my sackful, I need my sackful
I need my sackful, I need my sackful
I need my bills paid, I need my sackful
So where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy
Where them dollars, daddy</pre>
