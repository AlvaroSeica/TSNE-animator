[Intro: Prodigal Sunn]
Cake up baby, Cake up baby
The American way, It's money time, Miller time

[Prodigal Sunn]
Flippin Dineros coppin estates from city to state
Keepin my stress at a low rate, Cause rate with the eight
Food on the plate, It's all about the chances, Rules, Risks that you take
They say good things come to those who wait
And never ever give up your fate, Get up your weight
Stack and break, Stay away from snakes and flakes and Jakes
They love to criminate they trappin the bait
Fiends sniffin raw straight, Now I ran for the cake
Pimpin, your power infiltrates to makin decisions
Stay cookin some marvelous shit in the kitchen
Precision, Like Meth vs. Chef, Sunzini the flame has risen
Dedicated to every hood from the streets to the prison
When you build your team son, We still deal with division
Take the time to stop look and listen, Crooks on a mission
Vision for tuition, Sunny keeps his head on straight
Stay away from dead weight, Affiliate
Rugged bakers real astate, We stay out for the cake

[Outro: Prodigal Sunn]
Cake, Getting money nigga, And yo we cake
Big up, On the take up baby, Cake
Gotta get that money man
That's what they say it is, That's the motherfuckin American way baby
It's either that or you don't eat, It's rich or poor baby
Aint no in betweens, Better know that, Cake</pre>
