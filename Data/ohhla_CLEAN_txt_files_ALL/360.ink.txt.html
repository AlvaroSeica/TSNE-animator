Song:   360
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I tell em 360 [x3] see the room spinnin round 360 [x3]
Watch the money fall down 360 [x3]
Baby tell me that's a round 360 [x3]
I know you see it go around
Money full circle
Blowin full circles
Smoking on that color purple
On the beat I go silly real ugly mawfucker
Bitches love that I'm a rapper but she know I ain't a sucker
360
Look might break your neck
Everybody double take know I'm late on set
Got a pocket full of green faces like gumbi
But to take another round call it 720
Headed to the club gonna close in an hour
One on one east bound and the loud give me power
I just took off face look sour
I got her on the line scream my name like alvin
I am just sitting back reclined like calvin
High you can see it in my eyes like salmon
Doin way passed 60
Girl I think you just missed me

[Chorus]
360 [repeats]
See the road spinning around
360 [repeats]
Watch the money falling down
360 [repeats]
Baby turning .. around
360 [repeats]

I tell ya what goes around comes around
360
When it comes to bad bitches I keep three with me
One to fuck me good
One to suck me good
One that ride hard hold the work tuck it good
Only thing I wish I wish a mother fucker would
I am living life and get money like I fucking should
I am on another level that make you understood
Oh you ain't understanding
Nigger I am meagan good
360
We make them 360
Popcorn looking like a box of rice krispies
If I don't make a hit shit the feds gonna get me
I am gonna keep shining on these haters until they hit me
100 thousand dollar cat 20 dollars bills bitch I will be on that real shit
Trying to chase some real shit
Just came back from Hollywood ill will to Will Smith
Right back to the hood where my goons kill shit

[Chorus]</pre>
