[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
When did rap turn into a fashion show?
Too many makeup artists won't let their passion show
The anti-social mogul, havin' 20/20 visions
In needa bifocals, for your eyes dilated ojos
Open wide, never did I owe hoes
Suck a dick dilated, tell my old hoes
Hit my main bitch in the Poconos
I'm not Pinocchio, I never lied I'd poke her nose
With the dopest dope, brand new Pablo, brand new God flow
It feel like, Escobar and Apollo
Swank apparel, I put a pic on the site 'ya megabytes
Y'all niggas ticking me off like headlights
Get your head right, it all falls down
I bread right on the house
Also 106 &amp; Park and still on the couch like, "Bitch fucked Jacob"
I went to meet my maker, with 25 sacred stones
Told him save me a few acres

[Interlude]
Yeah, cause' we just some Amethyst Rockstars
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Amethyst Rockstar
Try aim at this Rock Star!
Time just keeps on falling, falling, falling

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
How is Hip-Hop dead? I'm still makin' a killin'
Banana clip peelin' n ho's I'm still stealin'
This is not for the soda pop niggas
Take me to the leader of the new school or the block dealas
Cause all these fakes mcs take from those figures
Is what get fake mc's infront of loose triggers
Can't knock the hustle though, I may just bust a jigga
And lookin' through my eyes you can kinda get the picture
Mo money mo problems as ya get notorious, inglorious, until you're a big victorious, no show,
Only way ya get to see the kid is through a photo
Or burnt up logos, and the females come out at night
And when the find the pot a gold they strike, seducing me?
Wait y-y-yeah, you nice on the mic, ye, you lookin right
And you just my type, yo
(Bitch don't get me tight)
Her friend split n dipped, damn I shoulda seen this
I'm in a boobie trap and that's some clever ass cleavage
Well, I think with my dick, I know you want to blow my mind for that reason
She said "You got clever speaking"
And after I'm done, I still got it leaking
I dipped off 'cause knowledge a nigga' is still seekin'
What you lookin' at son? I might rob you blind
Defined by every line, niggas tryna' outshine
We're both number one enemies, it's sad though
One on one, and it takes two niggas to tango
Two niggas to tango
Watch me go rambo

[Outro]
"Don't Front on a nigga like me
Time just keeps on falling, falling, falling"
