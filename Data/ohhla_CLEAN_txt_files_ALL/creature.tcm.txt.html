3 months in, and we've stayed between the righteous cones
Jesus Christ be the Lord of our Love jones
No ones home and she needs company for the feast
that she was cooking so I slid on over to her piece
Got on my eats, she's my peeps and I know I'm blessed
but in a flash, trash is rising up in my flesh
Our talks are pure, nothing but about the Good Shepherd
But Honey got a walk more badder than a black leopard
My old masters' back, trying to drown the voice of my Teacher
like something Jurasic vs. My new creature
Both of our Christian eyes caught one another scopin'
We couldn't front, we knew we both were open
What da deal, this ain't the way to go for God's anointed
the last thing we want is a Holy God disappointed
But what the heck, a peck won't take us cross the fine line
Oh my God her lips just turned into some Bon-Bon's
Now I'm locked, I wanna stop, Lord Jesus help me
Oh yeah, you said if I resist the devil he would flee
And you also said that I should flee youthful lust
but my legs our stupid heavy and my feet are stuck
I know in marriage is where you'll give me the whole bunch
but now she's smellin' sweeter than peanut butter Cap'n Crunch
And Lord you know what that's been doing to a brother lately
Father forgive me, I think I'm going crazy

[Chorus]
Temptation, now or later
less or greater
keeps war between my nature
totter, teeter, stronger, weaker
old master vs. Teacher
Creature Double Feature

Friday night, got liberty to do it all
But that ain't wise, cause even got liberty to fall
I'm Saved, Eternally Secure, and being Sanctified
Whoever said Christian life is all fun, then they lied
Now Jesus is my Lord, and ain't no doubt about it
but it's 10 p.m., clubs are open, and they're bout it, bout it
And I know all the world has to offer is obituary
but I'll kill myself if I play another game of Pictionary
Monopoly, Taboo, Bowling or even Guesstures
Freaks are coming out, and it's the end of the semester
Deep down I feel the Spirit really urging me to stall
but am I more of a Christian locked inside these four walls
God, was I snatched from death to now live like a hermit
if this is a lesson, teach me, because I can't discern it
But I guess it ain't right for me to get all excited
and race out to the party where you ain't even invited
WORD BOND!, they ain't lettin' you in, and this I know
They'll make you stand outside, while inside we say, "HO!"
And you probably would wait there for me until I got my freak over
but that ain't right to do to a person who's name is Jehovah
Help me, I see it ain't cool if you ain't welcome LORD
but I'm still contemplating going because a brothers bored

[Chorus]

Well now, Christian am I, Reborn, Rebuilt
When Christ comes to bust the party, I'll feel no guilt
I got my brand new, "not of this world," mind set rollin'
and though still "in this world," it's so hard to let go the controllin'
Smoke at one time, was my passion and fashion. 
I'd puff-up all yours, just to keep my own JASMIN
Habit now a has-been, even though my crew still does it
I don't touch it, I got new needs, new steez, new budget
But there is something about today and me in there presence
though I've been around before when they've sparked herbal essence
every round of the cypher, I'd say no, they'd still offer
Lord I wish this was back in the day when I was a cougher
Cause in those days, "Brown Sugar," I couldn't stand her,
But Blunt Boot Camp soon made her my commander
She'd say, "Get up, Stand up, Blunt's is on tonight."
She'd say, "Fill-up, Roll-up, cause Trees we're going to lite."
Yeah, yeah. She'd say, "Get up, Stand up, L's is on tonight."
She'd say "Spark-up, Puff-up, It's Natural, Ain't no Wrong or Right."
And now that I'm down with Christ
I'd thought I would hate the smell of homegrown
But right now, it's like, "The sweetest smell I've ever known!"
I'm blown, Lord I don't want to go back to the wrong route
plus this will kill my witness and all that I been sharing about
Like how God wants to take a man, split  and spiritually gut him
Teach belief in His Son, fill with His Spirit and stuff him
Lace him, Lick him, heal and reseal the epidermal
then give a Christ-Like spark and let Life burn eternal
And like how I'm trying to diss the old master to obey my new Teacher
Cause any one in Christ becomes a new creature
And those who walk in the Spirit will never lack
which means I'm doing something wrong, because I just caught a contact

[Outro]
I Corinthians 10:13. 
No temptation has seized you
except what is common to man
And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear
But when you are tempted
he will also provide a way out
so that you can stand up under it</pre>
