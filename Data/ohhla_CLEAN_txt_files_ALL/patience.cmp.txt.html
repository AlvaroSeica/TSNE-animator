Turn up ho
What up fresh
Ha ha
I swear I'm outworking
U niggas
Link up

One thing I can't trust is a liar. I swear, I'm on fire
Steady killing niggas. caught a grip, just like some pliers
You can't fuck with me, I'm on my job, I can't get fired
Came up on some money, now I'm flyer than a flyer
Told all of my niggas, we gone get it, just be patient
Everyday I'm working. man, I need a damn vacation
Jumped up off the benches, now they got me in rotation
I see that she with you, now thats my girl, boy, no temptations
The same niggas that told me, that I wasn't gone be shit
Is the same nigga thats on my line, just bandwagon my click
Since day one, I saw the vision, I had a spot at the top
And I'm just warming up. this shit here, won't stop

Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now (we on, we on, we on)
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
It just took a lil bit of that hustle
Took a lil bit of that grind
My whole team, we eating, baby
Yeah, we all gone shine
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now

I swear, I was bless with hella patience. look at all they faces
I smell bullshit from a mile away. I know they hating
It's been plenty years, that I been put in situations
Niggas keep that bullshit in they mouth, just like some braces
But I come out clean, nigga. but I come out clean
Go back in that fort, young niggas pack just like sardines
Them same niggas loyal. boy, can't nothing come between
Exactly, why I do it for my team

Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now (we on, we on, we on)
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
It just took a lil bit of that hustle
Took a lil bit of that grind
My whole team, we eating, baby
Yeah, we all gone shine
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now
Yeah my nigga we on now</pre>
