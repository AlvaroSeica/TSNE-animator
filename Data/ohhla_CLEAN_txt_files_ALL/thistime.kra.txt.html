Song:   This Time
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ahh It still feels good
You were always there to bring me breakfast in bed
And when I stayed out late you had some powder for me head
I've been a bad man
But you never paid no mind

[Chorus]
We've had some long nights
But we're alright this time

I've been leaving something I just don't know what it is
And every time I climb I wind up back on the skids
You always stood by me
When the natives start to whine

[Repeat Chorus x2]

You're like an angel with a 12 gauge (Lock and load)
You're like a wheelman on a get-away (Hit the road)
And together we ride
You ain't Bonnie I ain't Clyde
But we made out of town just the same
I could take a taxi but it's better when you drive
You always come between me and the mess outside
I could buy you a ring
But you'd rather have the cash
Ha ha and that don't even rhyme

[Repeat Chorus]

Here together we ride
You ain't Bonnie I ain't Clyde
But we made it out of town just the same
I could take a taxi but it's better when you drive
You always come between me and the mess outside
I could buy you a ring
But you'd rather have the cash
Ha ha and that don't even rhyme

[Repeat Chorus x3]</pre>
