Four niggaz under our groove

Four niggaz, we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now, uhhhhhhh
ATL                              ---&gt; KM.G
We go, four niggaz under our groove
For the funk of it               ---&gt; KM.G
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
Outlaw, out law                  ---&gt; KM.G
Four niggaz, we're on the move
For the funk of it               ---&gt; KM.G
Nothin' can stop us now, uhhhhhhh
Pimp Clinic, Pimp Clinic         ---&gt; KM.G

[KM.G W/ Echoes]
Pimp Clinic, Above the Law..
Pimp Clinic, Above the Law..
187Um, and I'm KM.G, Go-Mack, For the funk of it..

[Cold 187Um overlapping KM.G]   
Boo yaa, right about now I'ma got to drop some flyyyyyy
Flyyyyy, some cooooooooooooooooooooooooool
And I'ma drop the bomb like this to you

[Verse 1: Cold 187Um]
Now, here's another way to get payin'
I'm million dollar nigga, not the million dollar man
G, I break a bitch like class
And if she give up a lyin' I put foot into her ass
Nigga, I smoke weed sometimes with the street hustlers
But you can cope some dope wine, and toss some 40s like a motherfucker
I think it's.. I'm about to move some fly shit up
I play it from the Old to New School, trick school up
You hooked to my style like a fiend on coke
It's like the moral junky you get, the mortal junky smoke
I don't slip, but I stalk with the whip 
Cause I'm vocally pimpin, while I'm proud I'm gifted
But yo, once I'm pimpin, the whores all know I got a gang of them
Who gives a fuck if she claims somethin?
Cause late at night, I got the creeps on a whore
I throw a penny at the window, she be ready to go "OOOHHH"
I wouldn't treat like a sneak, I treated her just like a queen
Take straight to the Mongareen, and did the wild thing
Yo, then I went back to the set
And if my homies ain't stossin' out, I'm takin' none of bitches 
Until it's gone if my homies can't have some "Sure baby"
What's the matter baby, I thought you wanna have some?
Cause you whore, is not our whores
And incase you didn't know, your bitch swings low
Flipped into a spot on a strip, break a fool off a mega somethin'
So don't trip cause I'm a South Central player and I gotta admit it
Last fool tried to fade this, we got him ass kicked
They call me a G but I ain't never gangbanged "Gangster"
Maybe because all the Keys I slanged
They call me hustler cause the money I make
You know, why they call you a player? ---&gt; KM.G
Maybe because all the bitches I break

[Break:]
NOW HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE!!
Yeah, the industry is the filthy and I'm all up in it
NOW HOLD UP, IS IT SLICK?

[Verse 2: Cold 187Um]
Don't worry about it, baby, cause I got a fat dick
So here we go, here we go, here we go, C-O-L-D
187Um from the A-T-L Posse
How you gonna tell me where I'm ought to be within or where I been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
How you gonna tell me that you digged me when you digged whack dumbs?
They don't wanna understand where I'm comin' from ---&gt; KM.G
No, I'm finna blockin' the bridges, just from these broke ass niggaz
Who steal the rag from the flag and comin' up much faker
Cause I say: about ten years from now, I'll be finicially stable 
And I can probably take the piles on a turn, look back over the field
To see my Ups and Downs, to see the caps I peeled
And see the people who are still, down for the crown
You know, I have to give a shout out to the underground "That was fly"
So players, let's just chill cause things are better
And remember like mostly boy, nothin' changes but the weather
Cause I'm the Coldest, the Colder, the 187
The one that's known to put the fly pimp shit together

[KM.G]
Plus, me the KM.G the mega dick on call
I'm the one that's known for bumpin' the walls

[Cold 187Um]
And in the back, who's that?
A man with the style, a ranchin' ass nigga and we call him Go-Mack

[KM.G]
And the Gangster, who was ready to toss
Some call him strawberry known as Total K-Oss

[Chorus: DJ Total K-Oss &amp; Go-Mack]
