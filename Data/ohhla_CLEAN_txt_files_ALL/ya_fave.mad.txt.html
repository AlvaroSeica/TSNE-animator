Uh, uh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Come on! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Skillz, uh, yeah, uh, S, K, I, double-L, Z, Oh!
VA, Rawkus, uh, uh, uh, oh!
Two thousand and two, oh! Oh!
Yo, check me out, oh, oh, oh!

Yo, I ain't choose to rhyme, y'all better get it right
The saga continues, another bad boy for life
The F A, B O, L O know who I am
'cause he heard me and he was, like, "da-da-da-da-damn!"
Mad to the Ski-del, from "V to the izz-ay"
Get B D S N without havin to pizzay
"Girls, girls," they know how I do
Man them broads act a fool when I SKIRT on twenty-two's
Oh! Take ya shirt off, get prepared!
Stop actin like a B are you scared?
"In my projects!" I don't like Drama
Where you get them flows from dog? I get them from my mama!
Like Mos and Beyonce I keep y'all guessing
Plus my ass ain't independent no more, huh, question?
"I'm focused man", a sick MC
And y'all don't wanna "FUCK WITH ME!"
Uh, got skillz, and that's no doubt
Uh, you can "Put Ya Hands Up" you might as well "Knock Yourself Out"
That's the damn anthem, raps taste like candy
But y'all won't see me like Suge in Miami
And I'm gon' make it
Half of y'all get on TV and fake it
'Cause see, after the show I'ma start the thuggin'
And then hit a Lil' Mo' and get a "Superwoman"
Then, "ANTE UP!" man I told them hoes
Girl, shake it fast when I "throw them bows!"
DJ's who want intros, ya got to understand
That I ??? rap from more than one minute-man "OOOH!"
Like Juvy it's time for sum action
Back that thang up, "I'm sorry miss Jackson!"
I don't think y'all heard me
Come on the track like "du-du-du-duh!" "Let's get DIRTY!"
Blow minds like Eve, cause I don't care
I run upon you like {*beat from "Let Me Blow Ya Mind"*}
Oh, you got to understand
Dog, I'm like Fatman Scoop with a Crooklyn Clan!
And I'm killin' these cats with just one rhyme
Keep the drums the same, not "chicka, switch it one time!"
The industry is too damn confusing [Say what?]
Cause nowadays Babyface looks "just like muuuusic...!"</pre>
