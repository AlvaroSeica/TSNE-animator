[Chorus]
We pop bottles in this bitch to get our name up
I come from under the bottle nigga I came up
So many niggas surround me wanna flame sum'n
I'm like cool out, no money here change up
We pop bottles in this bitch to get our name up
I come from under the bottle nigga I came up
So many niggas surround me wanna flame sum'n
I'm like cool out, no money here change up

[Verse One]
Little leather niggas get it
I come from the back door where forty little live niggas with me
All on mollies it's nothin press niggas they up
Some in the mailroom in the club lightin blunts up
Walk through new jewelry clothes it's silks only
Besides gallons of milk with big bills on me
True the tunes is florescent 
They use lightin niggas he got all they shines out stretchin
Do you in the dark, whatever come out the light
Better be bread or weed or gold good night
Get the schemin shoot the shit up, with real niggas in here
They all minors long as they know tonight
Yeah that's the shit I don't like
Shorty dome hyped, grab her face mask don't bite
I'm in my mansion in the zone writin
I'm known for throwin lightenin I stand alone yo one titan

[Chorus]
We pop bottles in this bitch to get our name up
I come from under the bottle nigga I came up
So many niggas surround me wanna flame sum'n
I'm like cool out, no money here change up
We pop bottles in this bitch to get our name up
I come from under the bottle nigga I came up
So many niggas surround me wanna flame sum'n
I'm like cool out, no money here change up

[Verse Two]
Push the seven in the rain, come through with seven change
They call me young legend out in Maine
Known for tiltin niggas wigs
Don't kill the kids for not knowin where real rap remains
Treacherous mc react like Jack Dempsey
Yeah the billboard whore and I'm Pimp C
Fly as ever one level one rebel
Who cool out in the Caymans with thugs, crews and gangs
Yeah I rap for the merrier, dance my ass off
Paper chasin Captain America
Fly high livers who drive by, team of live wires
Who catch you outside we pry liars 
Yeah them blow kids live on the go kids
Never go broke grab your toast and smoke things
Killers know to call me the goat
For murderous rap music that get inside your head it's dope
WHAT!

[Chorus]
We pop bottles in this bitch to get our name up
I come from under the bottle nigga I came up
So many niggas surround me wanna flame sum'n
I'm like cool out, no money here change up
We pop bottles in this bitch to get our name up
I come from under the bottle nigga I came up
So many niggas surround me wanna flame sum'n
I'm like cool out, no money here change up</pre>
