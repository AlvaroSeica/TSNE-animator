Verse 1: [Sonny Spoon]

Somebody tell me what can a hustler do?
Trying to come up on a buck or two
Got words I wanna spit to you
But with no doe ain't never gone make it through
So I played the game, in the rain, felt the pain, moving things
Been locked in chains
But when I finally rose up I still went against the grain
Tell 'em what's my name
(Spoony)  You better know that
And best believe that my crew gone blow cause we don't hold back
Watching my doe stack
Becoz I'm out here pushing weight
Who want platinum plates, better forget the fakes,
We got to do everything it takes
You know some gone hate
But can't stop 'em now
Mad we dropping hot
Take a look I got CMD and Q with me
Y'all really better ryde or dye
Cause we playing the clown like 740's
Get rich while macking shawty's
If it ain't bout no money
I suggest you don't even call me
Better yet when I drive pass
Some of y'all just mad cause ya don't know me
That's why you jockin' me and my status
You wanna get grown I'ma tap that ass
Sing it bring it, playa cause I don't fuck around
If you come short with my papers you gone have to tear it down

Hook:

Tear it down! (5x) Tennessee tear it down, (tear it down)
Tear it down! (5x) Mississippi tear it down (tear it down)
Tear it down! (5x) Alabama tear it down (tear it down)
Tear it down! (5x) Miami, Florida

Verse 2: CMD

See bout thirteen years ago I tried to get off in this game
By the time I'm threw
Coming through, y'all niggas gone know my name
Be like you the man with them pretty vans sitting on them thangs
Used to live in Pleasant Hill and damn what's his name?
Be like yeah that's me, CMD
And I'm calling my daddy
All these people keep on asking me, but how did you manage
To be so broke
With so much doubt, and you never lost sight
I told 'em I worked extra hard, chasing dreams and pray every night
I'm finna take this silver off my neck and turn it in to platinum
I'm finna go from flat broke to letting the doe stack
Sometimes I wanna quit y'all with all this struggling
But then I think man, naw'll just keep on hustling
Cause all I wanna do is live my life
If I ain't living right
Then I'ma pay the price
I don't want yo advice
I'ma sacrifice
Until I see the eternal light
Yep, but know let me and Spoon get together!
See we down for whatever
No matter the weather
Staying away from the rain
Keep on driving through the storm
We keep on hittin'-y'all like this
How the hell we gone go wrong
So anybody don't wanna see me get mine
Raise on up catch a fire
Matter fact tear it down

Hook:

Tear it down! (5x) California tear it down, (tear it down)
Tear it down! (5x) New York tear it down (tear it down)
Tear it down! (5x) Carolinas tear it down (tear it down)
Tear it down! (5x) DC tear it down (tear it down)

[Sonny Spoon]

We got people out in the West Coast tearing it down
And shawty you know we got that South locked down
Everybody up in ATL

That's how we putting it down baby

Well tear it, just tear it, just tear it down
Just tear it, just tear it, just tear it down
Just tear it, just tear it, just tear it down
Just tear it, just tear it, just tear it down</pre>
