[Verse 1]
Once again it's me one of the three delinquents
Seems let loose from the noose now it's time to make G's
Oooh, Aaah, I hear a fat beat ballin'
Lordy lordy let me do some roll callin'
Kemo, O.G., Victor, Gigi, Pesci look hard and you'll see me
Trixx, big Ronnie, Sen and Sal
If you can feel me open up let me slam now
Hard than a muthafucka hush sho nuff
Lower EastSide of the West Coast take a puff funky
But twice burned and I won't be forgetin
The ones who tried to break me fake me I'm sweatin'
Represent me mine in the place I dwell
Big D in the air it's on ring the bell
Receive fuel for my mental I'm low gas me up
Big dog now but wicked even when I was a pup

[Chorus 2X]
I came to represent where I'm from
If you want some get some bad enough take some
I came to break you off and get some
If you want some get some bad enough take some

[Verse 2]
Step back give me room cause I'm takin' over
Rollin' punks over like a bulldozer
Cause I came to represent where I'm from
It's the Lower EastSide of the West Coast son
So hot diggity damn I'm gettin' figgity scram
I loose stability bam there ain't no fadin' the man
Who might that be that might be me
Yo soy el hombre
Cause I walk these streets like the righteous man
But I take no shit when I'm freakin' the flam
The incredible edible blend I got Latin juice
Some want to be like me but lack a few scoops
Fools cause I bring the flavor
Ives got my back O.G.'s on the fader
Damn I can't quit when I start this shit
But it's time well spent I came to represent

[Chorus]
I came to represent where I'm from
If you want some get some bad enough take some
I came to break you off and get some
If you want some get some bad enough take some
I came to let you know with no gun
If you want some get some bad enough take some
I came to represent where I'm from
From the back to the frente straight delinquente

[Verse 3]
Not the kingpin ask em all fool I thought I told ya
I'm just a little bolder than your average soldier
Staring at you psycho hey what's a huero loco?
Twisted out mental mad whacked in the coco
Never givin' up I got wisdom persistence
Two clips loaded in a glock for resistance
A flock of delinquentes steppin' through the silence
Mellow type of fellow still poised for the violence
O.G.'s on the left Sal's on the right
Blaxican warrior fuckin' up your blind side
Like the Hurra I'm coming O...F...F...
And I'm a rock a muthafucka till there ain't none left

[Chorus]
I came to represent where I'm from
If you want some get some bad enough take some
I came to break you off and get some
If you want some get some bad enough take some
I came to let you know with no gun
If you want some get some bad enough take some
I bring the real rock when there's none
If you want some get some bad enough take some</pre>
