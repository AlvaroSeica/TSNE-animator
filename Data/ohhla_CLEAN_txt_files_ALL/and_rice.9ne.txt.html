Verse one:

(nine)
Word life
Every day
every single day
Same old thing nah mean
Just anther struggle trying to put food in your stomach
keep a roof over your head
That's what it's all about (word up)

Get up in the morning and I take a bath
Count my cash and
Wash my ass and 
Think about the days when I was broke 
No joke
Lighting up cigarate butts just to get a toke
Starving Marvin I need a meal
Putting salt and pepper on a banana peel
Use to put the s on skittles from 9 to 5
Do whatever I got to do to stay alive
30 cents away from a quater
Going to the store for a forty of water
Hungrier than jack 
Dreaming of a big mac 
Two all beef patties speacial sauce and all that
But I can rap 
I'm going get mines and blow up fat
but the landlord don't want to here that
I'm 9 double m i'm going to be a star
He said pay your rent I don't care who you are
Disghusted and busted
Couldn't be trusted
Forget the hotdog all I had was the mustard
So much pain 
So many tears 
So many years
My pockets had rabbit ears
But now i'm paid 
I got money to burn 
You had your turn 
Now it's my turn
To make mad ends 
To spend with my friends
And to cruise in the Benz with the hens
Now I can eat lobster 
3 times a day and not care about the price
But I remember the 4 Chicken wings and rice

(chorus)
how u snacking on 4 chicken rings see
how u snacking on 4 chicken rings    2X

verse two:

(Nine)
I want to stuff my pockets like a turkey 
And hope that the record company don't jerk me
And work me like a prostitue 
And keep my loot
Use and abuse me and make me want to shoot
I'm in it for the cash and the love not the fame
And I want proper reprenstation of my name
Checks on time 
Royalties in affect
Don't bullshit me when it's time to collect
Life is a bitch and then u die
So I strive to stay alive and stay high
Sang a sad song 
Now I sing redrum 
So let the whole world know 
HERE I COME
All work and no play makes jack rich
I figured it out with that what you want shit
My pockets got hit 
No more 4 chicken wings
Strickly rings and things the pussy that brings
Kings on the thrones 
Blessing microphones
Living in the castle dark mask got my back so
I know everything going to be alright
No more 4 chicken wings and rice alright

(chorus 4x)</pre>
