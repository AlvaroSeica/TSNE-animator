[Intro]
Wrong place wrong time huh, cause you tripping
Wrong place wrong time huh, cause you tripping
Wrong place wrong time huh, cause you tripping
Get that desert eagle strapped in my lap, on a mission

[Big Steve]
20's on a Navigator, what I crawl
Mafio still scream, fuck all of y'all
I'ma ball, cause I'm a baller whodie
Cause that's some real shit, Juvenile and Baby told me feel me
I'm a Southside player, with my stacks on fat
In your city street or hood, nigga bring your hat
3rd Coast locks up, like a set of picks
Red nose in this motherfucker, wrecking shit
I told ya, I'ma mob over niggaz in a Range Rover
Fried out on my note, blowing hell-a-dosha
Universal exposure, is what I gain
24 month of caine, trying to lose the game

[Hook - 2x]
Wrong place wrong time huh, cause you tripping
Wrong place wrong time huh, cause you tripping
Wrong place wrong time huh, cause you tripping
Any fool slipping, on a million dollar mission

[Mr. 3-2]
Get that plex off your chest baby, it ain't worth it
18's knocking when I ride, picture perfect
On a sunny day, heated up
With some'ing jazzy on my side, I'ma beat it up
You got a problem baby, I'ma get you outta there
Cannons let loose, and fools dropping everywhere
Wrong place wrong time, it's a done deal
You bout the plotting, I'ma let ya have it that's for real
No tripping no role, homie we growed up
Nothing but Benjamin Franklin's, we fold up
Outta state overseas, now it's some'ing foreign
Big diamonds, glow on my white Ralph Lauren
Starring in my own movies, and motion pictures
But I'm still gutter still hood, I'll come get ya
Fatt Domino, whodie it's no slacking
Still bad acting, and heat pistol packing

[Hook - 2x]

[Trae]
In a black whip tinted, so these haters can't watch what I'm doing daily
Eighty grand and a label, make niggaz define shady
So I'm strapped, sitting on my swangas looking for the drama
I bring it to a nigga, and his mama
Southside to the death, ready for whatever banging Makaveli
In a car, so I pop trunk waving in a Cheve
So gangsta, haters better stay they ass in line
First one running up, gon' be the first to lay it down
I'll put it on they mind, and remind em that I'm the truth
Hop slab and I pulled on the block, and forgot the roof
Right place right time, but for you it ain't the same
Like Pat, I'll bring it to your shirt and leave a stain
Better stay up out the lane, I'm a hog when I swang
With a bad ass bitch, so thoed with the brain
Trae real with the game, so I'm known as a G
Out the ABN gang, and the S.U.C. huh
