[Intro: Cilvaringz (Promizz)]
Cock that shit back son, what? (2G shit, Cock Back)
(What? Cock Back) We can't have it son
(We're the best son, they can't fuck with us son)
(Yo, Sunz of Man) Cilvaringz (What up?)
Yo, what up Izreal? (Feel this, feel this, feel this)
Get down and feel this (C'mon son, Cock Back)

[Promizz]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo..
I'm the transmitter, hard hitter, wind shifter
Power like mines, scatter, dome piece splitter
Fake motherfuckers we about to get rid of
I jab a dagger in your larynx, now you hack-spit up
I'm wicked with verbs, vigilante on concerts
Brains splurt like Isis, to universe
Brains splurt like Ke-shawn the expert
Attract motherfuckers like bitches in short skirts
Compose motion, rapid like waves in the ocean
True motion, it's like chronic when you smoke it
I'm pure like China White, no gas bag at night
Insight strike like Askiki, challenge a fight
Fab mind, artistic design, Promizz the mastermind
Haven't started beef since I left swine behind
You called it, broke niggaz claimin that they ballin
but when we flash ya heat y'all the first one's crawlin
You war dance, but genuinely-enhanced
Y'all niggaz hold hands like faggots up in The Fan
It's real sands on pyramids in calm slants
Come to V.A., you in a small chance
So forfeit, call me the God corporate
My torch lit, read heiroglyphics on pulpits
Sculpture my mindframe to entertain y'all theory
Y'all niggaz don't hear me cuz y'all niggaz don't feel me

[Cilvaringz]
SUUUUU!
Guide me to the portals of my knowledge
Prayers by the Jordan to release me from the Bondage
The killer prophet of the off-shore wind
Pierce the war sting do the dance of the Bastard Swordsman
Throw darts of sacred vengeance, cripple ninjas
Ever since I move with civilized intelligence
Composed the senate for the burial of Yemen
The Killa Beez of Mantis follow RZA the legend
The Child of Izreal breaks bread with the Shaolin Monks
Wu-Tang Killa Bee, I sting with the blackest tongue

[Chorus: C.O.I.]
Y'all motherfuckers ain't ready for what we got here
2000, millennium, Cock Back, the new year
Only thing that drop from my eyes'll be a black tear
Izreal and Priest, battle on the frontier

[Ballistikk]
Yo, yo..
Virginia ain't for lovers no more, Virginia be for sluggers
Izreal be that bet, and I'ma smack you motherfucker
This Golden Hill veteren, mess with men, rollin in packs
Deep as a bitch, ready to murder men
Ballistikk, got me swallowin emcees
and any nigga on the street, is tryin to test these
It's '99 now and about to be 2G's
Ain't no hard heads in my click, we just killin this shit
Sub-urb marksmanship, roll next tale
Walkie talkie but about ready flip tip, 6 what my click hit
C.O.I., Sunz of Man, cop it, it's gon' hit
Underground shit, for my real niggaz to feel it
Shook niggaz to fear it and when my new year is cocked
in your cockblock, you're scared to come near it

[D.I. the Physician]
I spit the illest chorus, a descendent of Izreal fortress
The Specializt, the evidence, create tracks like modern medicine
Divide settle's like the fifty-fourth regiment
(Oh my lord, lord, lord, lord...)
My brain consists of elements, precision force
The vision of Gods, niggaz is fraud, this is a consequence
I'm precise marksmanship if you're still tryin to enter the world
Already conquered it and herald lands of Egyptian sands
Original man, a hundred and forty-four grand
I bleed for this hip-hop, word is bond, I got my shit cocked
With the murderous material, divide remains, imperial

[Eternal]
Yo, yo, yo..
Glaciers of Ice, skatin on tracks
As I cascade decades like a Caddy escalade
Verbal ballet, when a track's laid then I enslave
Then I pray to your God, "Oh my God!", we leave ya scarred
Infinite bars to damage you, but never hit
Fuckin with the Children, we made men
Due Allah, pull your cards, your odds, you're so ?
In the dungeon with dark hymns and black Timbs
We break jaws and crack chins
It's gothic, matter of fact it's the prophets
that you seein in your optics, y'all niggaz can't stop us
Fake mobster imposters, the gangsters - you better vacate
We're not kiddin your roster
My rhyme spittin over your building - your barrier
Carryin your derreire to an area of mass hysteria
I'm just preparin you for the terror, C.O.I.

[Chorus]

[Benevolent]
Yo, yo..
Set a course for off-shore, the force against the high force
Polly with my draws, the God wars for Star Wars
Episode C.O.I., stompin ass Skywalker
Before I crash collision, I saw your nerves sharp from sniper vision
The all see-er, came in on horse-back, the pioneer
The visioneer, brought in the new year as the engineer
Izreal 2000, the whole world was browsin
on the internet, stop when izreal.com crash the set
The global effect was effective, the Young and the Restless
The Gods of the nexus, block off the exits
Horizon, the sun setter, but never clever, mic setter
Endeavor the feather, bet ya I'ma hold it better
Cock Back, massacre, sever, CD, album, whatever
Release from Bondage, 2000 protector

[Chorus]

[Outro: Promizz]
C.O.I. motherfuckers, no doubt
V.A. motherfuckers
Cock Back 2000, Killah Priest, Sunz of Man
It's T.C. motherfuckers
No doubt, Izreal, feel this
The new year</pre>
