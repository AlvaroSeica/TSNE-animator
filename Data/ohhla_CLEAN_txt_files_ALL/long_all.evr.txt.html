[Everlast]
All my money's spent, all my prayers been said
Walkin up that hill, legs are nearly dead
Won't be long at all

Heartbeats tick away, feelin in my bones
Will I see the day, I pay off all these lones
It won't be long at all
Won't be long at all

Long and windin roads, I've walked 'em all in vain
But when that trumpet blows, hope they call my name
It won't be long at all

Put your rifles down, abandon all your arms
Sing your prayers out loud, your gospels and your songs
Cause it won't be long at all
No it won't be long at all
It won't be long at all

Stop your warrin ways, you only kill your brother
A future season{?} skies, the kindness in your mother
It won't be long at all
It won't be long at all

Teach your children well, beg them to be kind
Cause they'll be runnin shit when you're old deaf dumb and blind
And it won't be long at all
No it won't be long at all
It won't be long at all
No it won't be long at all</pre>
