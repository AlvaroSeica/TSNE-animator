Jas Mace Verse

It was like a dream, something I've never seen
Something like a model posing in a magazine
Maybe Vogue, maybe SPUR, maybe Elle
Man you get the picture, these words couldn't tell
But there she was looking so elegant
Didn't think I had a chance but I kicked it for the hell of it
She's out of town only here on a business trip
Trying to get a sip of Bacardi before she leaves the party
I bought her drink as we exchanged a couple jokes
A couple glances eye to eye that's when I knew it's time to go
We shared a taxi gently touching in the back seat
She whispered in my ear, won't tell you what she asked me
Went to the room, she said she likes the view
I looked her up and down and said, yeah I like it too
She smiled then hit the lights, but the rest is a fog
Then I awoke to a note, said it was great love Mirage and she was gone

Thurro Chorus

Sexy lady, stay 'til the morning
I want you bad, with that pretty little dress that your in
I got a, I got a baby
Ain't going nowhere
This can't be real
If I'm dreaming it sure ain't fair
It was just a midnight mirage

Marchitect Verse

She appeared out of nowhere where the surf lays
With the face of a goddess wide tail like a mermaid
Could it be, she's looking at me
Is she from an island in the Arabian Sea
Might be related to Lisa Raye
You know I like them nice and nasty like Michel'le
But I like them like them classy that's the least to say
You see that girl's booty 50 feet away
Okay, wasn't thinking she was digging on the kid
But she whispered in my ear started licking on her lips
She led me to her Benzo, drove me to her condo
Led me to her bedroom, started rolling bomb smoke
Taking off her clothes now, put them where the floor is
She moves in 6 speeds like Andressa Soares
And just as sure as the sun will rise
She was very long gone, she was just a mirage

Thurro Chorus

Sexy lady, stay 'til the morning
I want you bad, with that pretty little dress that your in
I got a, I got a baby
Ain't going nowhere
This can't be real
If I'm dreaming it sure ain't fair
It was just a midnight mirage</pre>
