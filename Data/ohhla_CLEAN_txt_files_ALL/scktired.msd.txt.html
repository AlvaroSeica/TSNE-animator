Typed by: webmaster@mattv.zzn.com

Oh, Oh, (ha, ha)
Cause when a woman's fed up...well well well oh oh

Must've thought that we'd always be together
Must've thought that I'd be here no matter the weather
Must've thought that I'd be havin your menace forever
You've thought wrong
Must've thought that I'd sit and take your shit
Must've thought that I'd never make the split
Must've thought that you're so addictive
You've thought wrong
I just can't be that girl that don't care
If you're not taking my love to anyone anywhere
I just can't be that chick that's gonna share, no
And if she don't mind that's her business, nigga better take you there

[Chorus]
Cause I'm sick n tired of the talkin
sick n tired of repeatin myself
I'm just cheatin myself
Sick n tired of the way that you place
should you say who'd she shoot the trace
So I'd be on my way
You can kiss a kitty kitty um bye bye
Nigga it's a pity but it's um bye bye
You can kiss a kitty kitty um bye bye
Nice try....

(check this....)
Must've thought that I'd be a foolish chick
Must've thought I was the type you used to deal with
Must've thought I'd turn the blind eye and take it
You've thought wrong
Must've thought that you could cheat this
Must've thought that you was my completeness
Must've thought that my kindness was weakness
You've thought wrong
I just can't be that girl ....., no
When my nigga playin around while I sit and play the fool
My self respect won't let me change the booze
And if she don't mind that's her business
Then my brother she the one for you

[Chorus]

Never know what you got till it's gone
brother you should've never tell me wrong
There's no withdrew
The best thing that ever happened to you
All the last cheaty track
I'm 'bout to fly I'm 'bout to say bye bye
It's now as clear to me that I'm just too much woman for you

[Chorus X2]</pre>
