Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This is a story about a girl that never let me down
Even though she's got a man she still comes around
Does that thing like no other girl
Like she wants to prove that she's the hottest in the whole world
Pretty much a solid ten
Meets me at the park so we can
Sneak freak again and again
From the back seat of my ride to the scratches on my back
Out of control breathing like an asthma attack
You want to break away so we can be official
Its wrong to love a married woman, but I can't resist her
3 o'clock in the morning, I'm sneaking out again
So close to the fire
I hate to be the liar
Damn, I probably should have never took the first hit
But by the third time, mama I just couldn't quit
And now I'm locked in this game
Refuse to walk away 'cause he could never love you my way

He could never love you girl, (ever)
The way that I will, (yeah)
Can't you understand, (can't you understand)
All these things I feel?
Never let you go, (that's right)
Even though what we got
Is a secret that no one's supposed to know (no one's supposed to know)
I can't let you go

I'm trying to hold you
But I'm losing my grip
Trying to keep you by my side
But you're starting to slip
Secret lovers in the dark
Crazy meetings at the park
It started like a game
But now you're messing with my heart
I love your touch, your kiss, and your frame
Our bodies melt together like we're burning into flames
I'm taking crazy chances when he's not at home
Leaving marks on my body, but I'm coming back for more
Its dangerous when you believe in your own lies
Even though she's not mine, a sin, a crime
Inside of me I know the right from the wrong
Every time she kisses me or plays that song
I feel this adrenaline, its something like a rush
Inside of me I feel my heart starting to thrust
And I can never let you go because you mean so much

He could never love you girl, (and he could never love you)
The way that I will, (the way that I do)
Can't you understand, (can't you understand)
All these things I feel?
Never let you go
Even though what we got
Is a secret that nobody's supposed to know (no one's supposed to know)
I can't let you go

I think that we should stop and think about the consequences
Its like I'm risking everything for this amazingness
When your body and your mind is in complete submission
When my conscious can't stop the heavy kissing
The phone's on the dresser, ringing off the hook
But we can't stop, mama please don't look
You see, I'm about to be up in the clouds
And you take me so high that I ain't never coming down

He could never love you girl
The way that I will
Can't you understand, (can't you understand)
All these things I feel?
Never let you go
Even though what we got
Is a secret that nobody's supposed to know (supposed to know)
I can't let you go (let you go)

He can never love you like I will
Oh no
Tell me you'll never let go
'cause I love you so

I can't let you go</pre>
