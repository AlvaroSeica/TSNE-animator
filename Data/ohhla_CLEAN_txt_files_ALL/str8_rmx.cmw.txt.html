[Intro: MC Eiht]
Yeah, we're in the motherfucking house
Half Ounce in the motherfucking house
And we're gonna do it like this

[Verse One: MC Eiht]
A fucked up childhood, is what the way I am 
It's got me in the state where I don't give a damn
Yeah, somebody help me, but nah they don't hear me though 
I guess I'll be another victim of the ghetto 
Ain't no escaping, cause I'm way too young 
Pops is dealing, and on top of that got moms sprung
Scheming off the top, pops never figured
That he'd go down by the hands of another nigga 
Now my pops is gone and that ain't no good
Got to follow in the foot steps of the niggaz from the hood 
And where's the role model? 
Fools putting brew in my fucking baby bottle! 
Damn, and through all the stress and the pain 
They done drove my moms in-sane
So I guess I gotta do work so I ain't finished
I grow up to be a motherfucking menace

[Verse Two: MC Eiht]
Now I'm up, aged, and living in the projects 
Getting paid off the clucks and the county checks 
I'm steadily fresh out of high school, never did I wonder 
That the motherfucking hood would take me under 
Yeah, I'm kicking it with the homies and they got the straps 
Off to the corner store, owned by the fucking Japs
See a bitch in the right lane so I comes with the mack
Astro Van pulls a motherfucking jack from the back 
Now he's got the strap to my homie's head 
See him play that shit cool, and don't be a fool! 
He shot my nigga in the fucking head 
I caught one in the shoulder, if I didn't run I was dead 
Now I'm laying in the hospital bed 
Thinking about the motherfucking fools and my eyes is bloodshot red 
Yeah punk niggaz, I ain't finished
Be on the look-out for this motherfucking menace

[Hook: MC Eiht]
Yeah, straight up nigga
Menace, Damn! - Whattup?
Willie, Willie, yeah


[Verse Three: MC Eiht]
I'm in too deep 
I done killed another brother and I just can't sleep 
One-Time is trying to do a smooth, creep 
And on top of that 
Niggaz after me for fucking one of they hood rats 
I ain't got time for the fucking bitch's story 
Niggaz want me gotta come to my territory 
And ain't no "You Can Get the Fist"
Niggaz come, and they get done on their own risk 
What is it all about? 
Should I leave or should I stay cause I don't wanna mark out 
Oh what should I do?  The niggaz say 
"The hood's where it's good, homeboy, I thought you knew"
So in the process to show the hood my best 
No time to react, caught two in the chest 
Now look who's down, I guess I'm finished 
I guess I'll go out like a straight up motherfucking menace

[Outro: MC Eiht]
Yeah, whattup? - we're in the motherfucking house
For the 93 shot, MC Eiht and DJ Slip in the house
Half Ounce Productions in the motherfucking house
Niggaz on the Run in the motherfucking house
Yeah, Compton, fool! Compton, Compton
Yeah, yo Willie, take me out of this motherfucker</pre>
