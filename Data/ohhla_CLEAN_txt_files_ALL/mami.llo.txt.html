[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Damn, yo Bis, they be kinda light, Bis
Damn, man, I see it though, I'mma get that

[Lounge Lo]
I was out in the city, just-a-just-a, my linger mode
I seen a nice one, small shoe, then I hoe
I walked up, like, can I have a minute, please
May I see your step, just a minute, before you breeze
You'se a working girl, independently
I see it all in you, but just remember me
My name Al Kaneel, now how you feel?
Before I start, let me say it, that your style look real
She like ok, replied with Keyshia
Represent BK, and in the Bronx, a teacher
Can we trade numbers, I'd love to meet cha
And give two thumbs, just not over the speaker
Hit the clubs up, Mr. Child for eats
And walk in Times Square, for the lights in the streets
Like ringing in the New Year, head to the sky, watching the ball drop
Standing right next to the sky, come on

[Chorus 4X: Lounge Lo]
Mami, mami, mami, mami, mami
Let's get 'em, let's get 'em, let's get 'em, up

[Lounge Lo]
Ok, now, it's on and popping, jaws dropping
Key' from BK, got them Stat boys watching
I bought her through to see Mama Lo, she took no kind of drug
But still, that's the part, and find it in love
Maybe not a maybe, you know the chicks are crazy
I got 5 babies, yes Lord, with 2 ladies
What it do, baby, what about a night out?
You can suck me off, and lick on my white out
And freak fest til we reeking of sex
And you can tell when my freak is at rest, mami mami
I wanna do you right inside my lobby
In Park Hill Projects, that's right where I be
You saw the building and thought twice, and recollect
Now you like damn, it's where Wu did Protect Ya Neck
It's all goodie booga, this my hoodie, Sugar
And I'm the Mayor of my damn town like Corey Booker

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Come here mami, come here sister, come here auntie
Uh-huh, all ya'll god damn females man, let's get
Let's get 'em up, let, let, let's get 'em up
Come on, man, come on, baby
Walk with the kid, man, the Stones is home
We still here and rocking, yessa yessa my Lord
Ok, ok...</pre>
