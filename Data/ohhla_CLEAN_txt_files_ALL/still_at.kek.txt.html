Typed by: Lil Hustle 

(*talking*) 
Hold up hold up, Don Ke nigga, that's right 
Heart of a hustler, that's right 7-13 nigga check it 

[Chorus] 
We still at it, and nothing here can change my heart 
We still at it, been pushing since the game first start 
We still at it, I hustle hard and play my part 
We still at it, homie we still at it 

[Lil' Keke] 
I woke up early this morning, I was a changed man 
I had to follow the vision, and switch the game plan 
I saw them laws last night, they in that same van 
The streets covered in colors, this shit is gang land 
If you's a rapper nigga, rap and try to climb that chart 
If you's a hustler nigga, never let em change your heart 
I see the bigger picture, I need that perfect frame 
I flash that red dot, don't need a perfect aim 
Feel like I rolled three hundred, with such a perfect game 
This shit is perfect timing, ain't that a perfect thang 
I'm still at it, I stayed down and held my way 
It's Don Ke bitch, I stay here and hail my fate 

[Chorus - 2x] 

[Chris Ward] 
Hey I'm still at it, got a bad busting seal habit 
Line for line a bar's a bar, either or I got skill at it 
Yo money's yo money, spend however the fuck you feel daddy 
Me I like money machines, and I love to count the skrill at it 
Any spot I be at be hot, I would't advise you to chill at it 
But with street intuition I got, I'd probably peel at it 
Screwed up to death, so every song I'm on I drill at it 
Them ol' snitch niggaz new the game, and they still ratted 
Me on the other hand, I stuck to the gutter plan 
Mash out cash route, till we reach the mother land 
We infiltrate the set, and all the bops they get a static pussy 
Niggaz feel the static, cause they know what we know fa sho 

[Chorus] 

[CB4] 
Mr. underdogs that is we, me and my nigga Killa 
If you would hate to see, niggaz know who we are 
They should be acting distant 
When you niggaz do that, it make you easily bleed 
When you down to your ass, that's what they like to see 
When you up on your feet, they pretend to be 
Smile a lot in your face, with negative energy 
These niggaz know we gon' be on top 
Cause I ain't taking no losses, we on now 
CB4 on now uh 
Dear mama dear mama, rest in peace 2Pac but 
I got us I got us, see this is my lil' promise 
To kill the game and be the best at it 
Know these suckers hate it, cause we still at 
We still mashing we still mashing, and I aint gon' stop like a automatic 
Came in the game with it all on my mind 
Elevated my hustle, and stepped up my grind 
It gotta get better with time 
A millie or mo', that's all on my mind illy 

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
