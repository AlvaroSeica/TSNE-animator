Hallelujah, I'm still walking
They tried to put me in the Dead Zone like Chris Walken
They try to kill me every day in every way
They take forty percent earned from every pay
Parking meters, gas a dollar a litre
Gulf war still on? Fuck George junior and senior
Three years of College and I'm fuelling aircraft
All those engine fumes, man I'm losing hair fast!
GSTs and STDs
They broke into my car and sleeve all my CDs
But it'll take more than that to get Annakin down
Orson Welles on the mic, got 'em panicking now
MSG in my egg roll but I'm still eating
Poison in my air but I'm still breathing
Shoe bombs on airplanes but I'm still flying
Streaks in my hair but I'm still not dying

They try to kill me with fear, hate and lies
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm living how I want fuck a nine to five
I'm alive, I'm alive
I spit truth on every fucked up line
I'm alive, I'm alive
Don't want to live forever but I'm never gonna, never gonna die! 

Holy Mackerel! I'm still talking
Shoved shit down my throat but I'm still hawking
Backwards and forwards, murder and redrum
Pining for the fjords, deceased, dead, done
They even killed rap, they stole my art
Then my bitch ex-girlfriend broke my heart
Computer viruses, stuffed up sinuses
Terror alerts, what kind of fucked up time is this?
Exposed my eyes to mass genocide
Armenians, Jews and Rwandan tribes
But I'm still alive, I will survive
Put Gloria Gaynor on my next forty five
Twenty car pile up but I'm still truckin
They say she's got herpes but I'm still fuckin'
Commercialized Christmas, but I'm still giving
They tried to kill the real mcs but I'm still living

They try to kill me with fear, hate and lies
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm living how I want fuck a nine to five
I'm alive, I'm alive
I spit truth on every fucked up line
I'm alive, I'm alive
Don't want to live forever but I'm never gonna, never gonna die! 

Who here got fucked today
Paid for gas at more than a buck today
Sayin' holy shit, life really sucks today
Screaming Goddamn I ain't got no luck today

They try to kill me with fear, hate and lies
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm living how I want fuck a nine to five
I'm alive, I'm alive
I spit truth on every fucked up line
I'm alive, I'm alive
Don't want to live forever but I'm never gonna, never gonna, never gonna die!</pre>
