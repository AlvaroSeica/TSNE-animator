[Verse 1]
To the angelic, seven can see through
Relic illadelphia, right words of power
Him who was holy, who holds the key
That opens, no one can sit it
Sick ven-a-nicious, sound of seven trumpets
Those, seven guys of satan
But falling down at my feet, knowing not to waken
I'm comin' soon for them, Eloheim's the New Jerusalem
Puttin', millennium, quintisential christians
Two, shall be revealed, by the seven cathedral seal
As above soap elope a whole David Shill
Early, every llama's about tonic
Those who defame me, shall keep open my wounds
No liars, allowed in the school of Mogoon

[Verse 2]
Seven plagues of the seven angels
Seven emcee's get strangled by the seven holiest triangles
Eye of magnum, plexy glass beams that see through
Sons of Evil, like Ronnie Knievel
I believe you, of the lamb, prepare for the verbal slaughter
Save your breath, like you was under water
I am torture, like the fear of internationalism
Nazi you genics and economic rationalism
I am the ming, born on to the swords
And I am the bing, bringin' holy wars
Orator's, from the womb of ill Yune
Glory be to, the, sustain a El Kaloom
Gabriel fell from the steps of the heavens
Extra eyein' evil, knew the angels in the seventh

[Chorus 2X]
As it was in the beginning
So shall it shall be in the end

[Verse 3]
Black Tibetan, out of-out of, henny ends
That begins the extortiation of the fullations
Battle through the tombs of your single eye
Illadelphia symbol a, enter the paradictum
A block suiter, Lord, a cyrian select through Hebrews
Pellets, of the historians, hieroglyphic
And I am, the silhouttes, a risky end inventor
The ill czar shine of two one five
Beyold sons of limitless light, porder rights
That's reveal, from the seventh heavenly hill
The book of el's, in jail, the apocalyptic tabernacle sacred
Satharotic, propheatical chapels
The synagogues of El Kaloom, the ghost fills the monastery
Sanctuary cathedral, from the kingdom of Melchezevik
We the mystic, redeem of end who knock ya Eloheim
We were originated, from land, the blackness
Of light was formulated, from our sylapsis
If you get, tarnished in all phrases, and salutation
To the mercifullness, glory of the Sunz of Mansion

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Sink like the Titan', into the cold
Dark waters of the ocean, my thought modes
Different land and center motion
Elevated to rise, beyond the shores, revelators
For episodes to the future, energy seekin'
Intruder, infiltrate the periemeter
Lock your MIA, initiation chamber
Move to the guard snakes, not a stranger
With four large spiritual anger

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
