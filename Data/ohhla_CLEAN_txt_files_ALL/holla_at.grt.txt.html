Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(La-la-la-la)
woo, woo, woo
(la-la-la-la)
all free girls across the dance floor right now
we're gonna do it like this

[Chorus]
(La-la-la-la) Baby, let me holla at ya
come on, you better than that
go swing it back shorty, let me whisper to ya
(la-la-la-la) Baby, let me holla at ya
come on, you better than that
it'll only take a second shorty, listen to me
(la-la-la-la-la) Baby, let me holla at ya
I know you're doin' your thing
but shorty, let me explain
girl, you better than that
you better than that
you better than that
you better than that

Baby girl you OK, are you OK
baby girl, it's kinda' lookin' like a bad day
nah, I ain't bein' funny or nuttin', but let me kick it to you real like a play, play cousin
'cause we go way back, like easy bake ovens
kept the batter in the fridge, 'cause there's roaches in the cupboard (ha, ha, ha, ha)
now that we've established that, go on take a load off and chit chat witch your brother
what happened witch your man, well that's what's up
I thought you said he was the one, and want to give him a son
and after him you was done, because there was no other
even got along good with his family and mother
girl, stop trippin'
you can't change a man, unless a man wanna change with thee, and rearrange his own plan, his own mind maybe
take a stand on his own leg, his own path lay

Real talk
you know you a flirt
but even realer baby girl, you gotta' love you first
see, don't let nobody else determine your worth
don't let another man or woman drag you down in the dirt
I know, truth hurt, but it's good like a medicine
swallow it down, let it work and get you better babe
learn to be patient, let God finish you first
you bigger them diamonds and a superficial purse
(la, la, la, la
hello BeBe, you and me-ee
la, la, la, la
elevate, hollow me-ee
la, la, la, la, la
L-O-V-E, you and me-ee
la-la-la-la-la-la, la-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

Beautiful baby girl, you're baby bobby head
precious as baby's is born, baby's a perfect ten
almost as perfect when you, you make your presence felt
you're strikin' presence it hit me, it hit below the belt
how can we cherish this moment, of pick and make it stick
know they impatiently waitin' for you girl, this is it
it's the time I fine dine, double date, triple date, fine dine, sippin' on fine wine
time fly's by, before we close, eyes don't lie, well sometimes they do
and big girls cry too
try to properly, prepare myself for future burn
girls, while I carry those, careful so at every turn
not just a job, but an adventure, I come to pinch 'ya
call Alamo to wrench 'ya, prayin' to the God I've sent 'cha
important as indentures, either or, I can't leave 'fore our lives are intertwined like chained link fence
(la, la, la, la, la
L-O-V-E, you and me-ee
la, la, la, la
elevate, hollow me-ee
la, la, la, la, la
L-O-V-E, you and me-ee
la-la-la-la-la-la, la-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

(La-la-la-la) And if I loves you Bro, we gotta' get through, through
listen to my teacher, be a stud'nt
(la, la, la, la) I ain't the one to steer you wrong
wrote the lyrics to this song
helpin' others in your position, to move on

(La-la-la, la-la) And if I loves you Bro, we gotta' get through, through
listen to my teacher, be a stud'nt
I ain't the one to steer you wrong
wrote the lyrics to this song
helpin' others in your position, to move on
