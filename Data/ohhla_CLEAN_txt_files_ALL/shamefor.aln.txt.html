Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

I've been thinking that you've crossed the line
If you disappeared that would be just fine
'Cause you waste my time and waste my money
And you're not too cool and not so funny
Spreading your seed all over the town
Getting too greedy and messing around
And oh my gosh you must be joking me
If you think that you'll be poking me

Don't take me on, No no
Don't take me on, No no
Don't take me on

Shattered the lie but you think I don't already know
Don't try to deny 'cause my fuse is ready to blow
It's your turn to learn
I think you know, where to go
It's a shame shame shame shame for you

Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

Please don't come around and knock on my door
'Cause I don't wanna have to pick you up off the floor
When you ask if we can still be lovers
I'll have to introduce my brothers
I think that they could teach you a lesson or two
By the time they've finished you'll be black and blue
You'll be crying like a baby
Your sea of tears they'll call the navy in

Don't take me on, No no
Don't take me on, No no
Don't take me on

Shattered the lie but you think I don't already know
Don't try to deny 'cause my fuse is ready to blow
It's your turn, to learn
I think you know where to go
It's a shame shame shame shame for you

Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
No no no no no no no-oo-oo
No no no no no no no-oo-oo

Don't take me on, No no
Don't take me on, No no
Don't take me on

Shattered the lie but you think I don't already know
Don't try to deny 'cause my fuse is ready to blow
It's your turn, to learn
I think you know where to go
It's a shame shame shame shame for you
Shame shame shame shame for you

Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
No no no no no no no-oo-oo
No no no no no no no-oo-oo
No no no no
Don't take me on
Don't take me on no
Don't take me on oh
