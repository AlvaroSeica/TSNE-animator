[Solo]
Uh huh, uh huh
From the spot where I sit in the middle of the playground
I watch as the children accept their fate
See round here, we never seem to see much change
But they still providing us with hourly updates
The bus lane's full of traffic and the train's running late
in the city full of strangers where every smile is fake
They pay top dollar just to watch you spill your sentiments
Looks like Nick forgot to take his medicine
Popped collar for the veteran
Centre stage fright, late night hype eyeing my competitors
And the cycle's set in motion
with a money-back guarantee, the end result will get you open
Picture me as Lucky Stripe in the clubhouse
Love ain't enough now, they want your blood
Hoping for violence, the first and second rules dictate
a code of silence with fight clubs in every major town
So come play around, but just know that we don't play around
Quit holding your piece, you better say it now
You so throwback, what you afraid of now? Famous, take 'em out

[Fame] + (Solo)
So you a chosen one, or just a loaded gun?
Better understand or get your shit overrun
(We ain't playing with this, so keep spraying your shit
 Fall back to the sideline and wait for the *click*)

[Chorus 1: Fame] + (Solo)
Aiyyo Solo, let's play Russian roulette
Pick it up, spin the cylinder and put it to your head
We keep playing till something connects
We keep playing till something connects
(Yeah Fame, I'm down to play Russian roulette
 So pick it up, spin the cylinder and put it to your head
 We keep playing till something connects)

[Fame]
Okay, we in the centre right? Fighting like lime-lighters
World stage pay with the highest prices
Nah, nah, my mans ain't care who you're better than
Old style weathering and tethering
Out here, we never seem to see much change
Re-up, re-hash but then might still sound plain
Drums on slots for the belt
Now you saying nothing proper so we got to take shots at ourself
Like please, someone put him in his place
He getting complacent, we pass that, Solo come on pass that
Nah he ain't really bout that, he ain't really bout to blast that
Ask that, I'ma make my own spot vacant
(So tell me what you want from me)
We so total now, ya know Famine keep it lowbrow
Yeah I keep score but I ain't about to know how
I marked this, boy we ride off in the darkness
They tryna get in, we only tryna get out
Fresh out of fresh, I clown 'em like tadow
Vicarious, voyeuristic, all for the click, click
So down for the next round

[Solo] + (Fame)
So you a chosen one, or just a loaded gun?
Better understand or get your shit overrun
(We ain't playing with this, so keep spraying your shit
 Fall back to the sideline and wait for the *click*)

[Chorus 2: Solo] + (Fame)
Aiyyo Fame, you wanna play Russian roulette?
Well pick it up, spin the cylinder and put it to your head
We keep playing till something connects
We keep playing till something connects
(Yeah Solo, I'm down to play Russian roulette
 So pick it up, spin the cylinder and put it to your head
 We keep playing till something connects)

[Chorus 1]
