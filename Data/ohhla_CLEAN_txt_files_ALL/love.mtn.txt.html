Can you hear me (yeah wassup) how's that sound
I don't hear the track (there it is)

Ohhhh yeah, hey fellas (what's up?)
I think we should set it off with a little slow jam
(Yeah) (Right on) (You're the extra smooth Casanova)
Why don't we kick it a little somethin like this (okay)
Check this out

Girl..
If you were a newspaper, then I would be your ink
If you were a piece of doo doo, then I would be your stink
We go together like Abotto and Costello
Bill Cosby and Jell-o.. peeing, and yellow
If you were a face, and love was a fight
Then I would rearrange you, oh yes I just might
Lady you look luscious let me lick you like a dum dum
Just let me get to know you, and show you where I come from
I pump you like diesel, pop you like a weasel (Vanilla Ice)
I would be acryllics, and you would be my easel (Let's paint each other up)
I'm a remote control and you're my favorite channel (channel 10)
Girl I dig you like a mole I want to hump you like a camel
And then commence to suckin out all your tooth enamel

(It's good love baby - let's get the novacaine baby)
(Tell 'em what you got to say)

Yo check it, I like this part comin up (aww yeah)

Baby..
I am Joe Blow, the lover man (okay)
You should be payin me (yeah true)
(Where's my money hoe?)
(It's the pimp daddy of 'em all, check it..)</pre>
