(Mastamind)
See, I don't know what you beliven in, but I hope you believen in me
nigga fuck yo G.O.D, my religion is reality, see

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to church (no I don't wanna go to church) X3
I don't wanna go to church (no I don't wanna go)

See, I cant step up in yo cathedral
I might bleed you
I don't need you to tell me who made me
I don't believe you
My thoughts bust
Fuck
Who can I trust
Whats the fuckin purpose
If I took a little ride on that church bus
I'd cuss out the rev
Bust and size out his head
My holy bible collects dust
Cause its never been read
So what is evil
What is my evil
I see you people hate me
Cause I wont step up in your steeple
But oh no!

[Chorus]

(Esham)
I'm sick in the head
So I tried to kill a priest
But now I'm killing time
I'm in the belly of the beast
No study the bible
Bloody rifle
The disciple of NATAS
Satan
Anticipatin
Contemplatin suicide
Murder ride
And I'm the dri-va
Bloods in my mouth
Mixed with my sali-va
I'm screamin out Jesus Christ
Bloody murder, crucified
When I close my eyes
Got visions of when he died
and...

[Chorus]

(TNT)
Motha fuck the reverin
187
I've never seen a church
I never been to church
I never liked church
So what is this sac religious mohta fucka
Sayin to me
Runnin around
Screamin out blaz 4 me
The holy bible burns my hands when I touch it
I cant clutch it
So motha fuck it
I do with out it
Simple reasons keep me from sayin the lords prayers
Truth or dares
And fuck them niggas who scared
Who cares

[Chorus]</pre>
