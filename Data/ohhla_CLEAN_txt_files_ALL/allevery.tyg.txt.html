Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Gold all in my chain, bitch
Gold all in my ring, bitch
Gold all in my watch
Don't believe me, just watch
Nigga nigga nigga
Don't believe me, just watch
Don't believe me just watch, bitch
Nigga nigga nigga
Don't believe me, just watch, bitch
Don't believe me, just watch
Gold all in my chain
Gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch
Don't believe me, just watch

[Verse]
T Raww I don't fuck with niggaz
My money long, my temper midget
King gold chains I reinvented
This gold shit, you a gold fish nigga
Try me, four kings like free sale nigga
Sippin' out a cup like a toddler, nigga nigga
Who the fuck want drama, pain
Back at it like a chiropractor, mane
That that nigga rock a quarter mil in chains
Gat squirt at ya like Stacey Lane
Nigga nigga sunroof ya brain
Came out to drink but you can't even hang
Only came 'cause a nigga got paid
Sleep with them hoes, they gon' fuck up your name
Pop the Zanny I'm stressed
Pop the molly I'm flex
Dre Beats my beats bang, biker jeans, ball mane
She suck me off till I'm all drained
Kick her out, Liu Kang
Wild body need two lanes
Got a fiver for a bitch that go to Tulane
Niggaz think that I'm playin'
I ain't sayin' this shit to be slayin' a nigga
Make your bed, lay in it, fucker
Born sinner, make a nigga die for his dinner
Eyes of a tiger, stone killer, cold blooded winner
Fuckin' beast, goin' HAM, gotta eat
Thanksgiving, don't thank me
Cause that ain't beef, y'all niggaz sweet
Money leech, money launderin'
Private jet, I don't fly economy
Man I make it rain while you niggaz try to maintain
All my niggaz gang bang, shout out Honey Cocaine
Last kings, YMCB bitch
187, stay on some G shit

[Chorus]</pre>
