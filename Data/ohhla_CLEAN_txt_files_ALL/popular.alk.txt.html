[J-Ro]
Ge-geah
It's the J-R, O
The whole world love the way I, flow
Puff 'dro but I don't sniff, blow
Alkaholiks make dough oh, no
Now you know you love my nigga Ri-co

[Tash]
My money so high but my car is so, low
I stand in that stance while I sip Olde, Gold

[Liks]
Ain't no dough then it ain't no show
We just don't show
We ain't goin, dowwwwwwn

[J-Ro]
We leave MC's in the lost and, found
Get up, pick up your face off the, ground
You get to tee off the Likwit, sound
West coast legends, the kings with the, crown

[Liks]
They try to slam the door but we kick it, down

[Tash]
Likwit town, L.A. California where Tha Liks get, down
L.A. California where Tha Liks get, down

[Chorus: Alkaholiks]
(Guess who's back?) It's Tha Alkaholiks!
(We're back!) {Buk buk, by popular demand!}
(Guess who's back?) It's Tha Alkaholiks!
(We're back!) {Buk buk, by popular demand!}
(We're back...) {...buk, by popular demand}
(We're back...) {...buk, by popular demand}
(We're back...) {Buk buk, by popular demand}
(We're back...) {Buk buk, by popular demand}

[J-Ro]
We - back, by popular de-mand
Doin it big, as big as we, can
Divided we fall, united we, stand

[Tash]
My pockets got the green but I'm not the weed, man
Ay ay you got that?  I got what you need, man
Rough raps and booze, that's what we feed, fans

[J-Ro]
I got a Bodycount like Ice-T's, band
The Liks bring it to you live like C-SPAN

[Tash]
Can't nobody do it quite like we, can
You know my reputation, three bars three, grand
King T is in this bitch and we, fam
Likwit Crew is in this bitch and we, tram

[Chorus]

[Tash]
It's that West coast shit built strictly by Californians
For the grimy niggaz with cases that's tryin to find a lawyer
What group is there for ya when the shit get whack

[J-Ro]
Alkaholiks muh'fucker, yeah niggaz we back

[Tash]
And not a second too late, in the paint, done bit the bait
They gave a nigga six figures just to rep the Golden State
WAIT!  I woulda did it for free
Cause everywhere you walk in Cali niggaz know about me

[J-Ro]
I hog the ball, that's the Earl the Pearl in, me
I write the songs to help the whole world be, free
When I rhyme it's a wrap, oh say can you, see
The best come from the W-E-S, T
You tryin to steal a nigga flow like Elvis Pres-ley
I got so much game I should win an Es-py
Hefty, that's how big my check be
Tha Liks back in the house 'fore we all set, free

[Chorus]</pre>
