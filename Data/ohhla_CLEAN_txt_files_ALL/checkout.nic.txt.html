Intro: Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh...
 
[Nicki Minaj]
Step, Step, Step up in the party like my name was that bitch
All these haters mad because I'm so established
They know I'm a beast, yeah I'm a fucking savage
Haters you could kill yourself
In my space shuttle and I'm not coming down
I'm in stereo and she's just so monotone
Sometimes it's just me and all my bottles all alone
I ain't coming back this time
 
[Chorus]
I can't believe it, its so amazing
This club is heated this spot is blazing
I can't believe it, this beat it banging
I can't believe it, I cant believe it
 
[Nicki Minaj]
Dun, Dun, Dun
The sun done, Yep, the sun done, came up but we still up in dungeon
The dun dun, Yep in London
Compeition why yes, I would love some
How the fuck the getting mad cause they run dun
Mad cause I'm getting money in abundance
Man I cant even count all these hundreds
Duffle bag everytime I go to Suntrust
I leave the rest just to collect in-trust
I mean interest, fuck my nemesis
Exclamation, just to emphasize &amp; I don't sympathize
Cause you a simple bitch, I just pop up on you hoes
On some pimple shit and but the iron to your face
You ol' wrinkle bitch

[will.i.am]
Oh we just to kill it, we on the radio, hotter than a skillet
We in the club making party people holler
Money in the bank, yea we gettin top dollar
I'm big baller, you a little smaller
Step up to my level need to grow a little taller
You a chihuahua, I'm a rottweiler
 
I can't believe it ... {*repeat*}
