Typed by: Cno Evil

[Joe Mafia]
Yo, I dirty dance on tracks, anthrax on disc or wax
High calibur's masks, cuz masterful black
MC ultra, vulture's dominant, prominant
Out of your hemisphere, with this here dog, and that's a promise
I'm on some other type, nothing nice, chopping off heads
And soundblocks, plus these juggernauts, straight out the box
Stay flooding the block, something to watch
Crab niggas fronting like they something of mine, sonnin' them, yo
I done steam on the whole team like you done felt though
Young guns busting four jingling you shelltoes
Love to see me locked up, posed up in jail clothes
Rotting in hell holes, oh hell no, lighting up dough
By the palo, estro, rap performer, stock broke
Mossberg, without a stock to you throat
Damn Mafia dope, world premiere, I make this clear
Ain't no games this year, yeah

[Chorus: Joe Mafia w/ adlibs]
The jokes on you, jack
The jokes on you, jack
The jokes on you, jack

[Joe Mafia]
Head banger, get a whiff of this through pen and witness
Finesse it on flames and toss the testers
You know the steeze, skin of they teeth, picking on cloverleafs
Breathe easy, thoroughbread heads, from every borough that rep
Bout that cheese, head or chest, bloody bubbles
At the fresh fest with the intra tech, respect
No doubt salute the vet, for doing this a decade stretch
Then keep this longevity, melody legacies
Bomb stealth, common wealth, the best kept
But need a chef in Hell's kitchen, guilty, no contest
Mob hat cats that keep your darts bent, four house flushing
Black Russian ties bonified, VA the skyline
Kid not, doing the bid, one strike, 25 to life
Yeah, yeah, put on the map, and now I'm stuck here
Rottweiler, survilist, no matter, how live it gets
Heavy metal hand cock pop

[Chorus w/ adlibs]

[Joe Mafia]
My pen bleeds from vets that held reps, respect
The projects, young guns is coming up quick
Gambling with life debts to pay off
And ones that spray off, son'll be here, if you took a day off, man
My eyes seen alot of drama I can't write
That's why I keep it gangsta, despite, who got stripes
Speedballing on the turnpike, twisting knobs back, relax
This rap officer, we ain't trafficking packs
Kool G. kaleidoscope, murder I wrote
We CEO's, corporate dough in a Srow, it's like that yo
You can't deny my glow, these cats kill me fronting, so, so
The jokes on you, jack, swallow this pill, dog, it's real dog
So blood gon' have to spill dog, that's how I feel dog
Can't stop me, watch me, grimey, type slick with it
Come on and get with me, City, I dare ya'll
Get, get busy, even dats or gats, I show you where it's at
With Maf, petty prop-prop, straight up out the melting pot
You smell me, huh? You won't forget me not, guaranteed
All eyes on me, I hope you got yourself, I got me, me

[Chorus w/ adlibs]</pre>
