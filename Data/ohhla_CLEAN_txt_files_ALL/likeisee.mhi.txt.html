( *phone conversation* )
- Hello?
- Yeah man, we need to do a hit on Mhisani.
- No problem.
- And just like always: 50% ahead of time, and 50% when I see that black ass dead.
- Got it.
- And don't fuck up.
We don't need Mhisani spreading that black power shit to the ghetto,
we need to keep this muthafuckin country red, white and blue.
Fuck them niggers.
- Cool, later.

[ VERSE 1 ]
Everybody thought I was a politician
When I released "Speakin' Peace" on my 12" "Listen"
But every circumstance causin different types of villains
In Oakland, California people need to stop the killin
You see, the city I live in is very intense
So I never hesitate to write another sentence
I speak what I feel, reality is relevant
I don't pick up the mic and be rappin for the hell of it
The media, they categorize and classify
They say I'm racist, political, but that's a lie
It's hard as hell growing up in a system with racism
Some brothers can't hang, so they go to prison
And rap music is a way of expression
I might rap clean and rap vulgar from agression
So view me as a humour, just aware and conscient
Instead of bumping the gums and talkin that nonsense
I call it like I see it

(Go 'head)
(I'm tired of bein told hella lies)
I call it like I see it
(Alright)
(Expose the enemy hidin behind a disguise)
I call it like I see it
(Go 'head)
(The conditions and problems and causes)
I call it like I see it
(Alright)
(Protected by the first ammendment clause)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Returning from the rap laboratory
Feelin kinda good, now I think I have a story
(Kick it) Girls turn me on in the open society
So many fine nations, damn, what a variety
Me myself I like em thick, I never trip on shades
Light or dark skin, hair down or in dookie braids
Is there a doctor in the house? (Yeah) Where is she?
Tell her to come backstage, I need some lip therapy
Some go through trips ( ? ) and start relationships
Some comin straight and get busy on the first date
The game on the streets is deeper than knee
Makin your money and keepin your freak, I peep, then I speak
But some brown-noser wants to bother my sound
He said, "Mhisani, won't you water it down?
Be a little more clean cut, never cuss, be like us and cross over"
Oh, you must be getting complaints from your boss, Rover
It's a damn shame rappers are bein bought for
Gonna speak the truth explicit or hardcore
But if it gotta be like that, then so be it
Cause I'ma call it like I see it

(Go 'head)
(You know that you cuss, don't deny it)
I call it like I see it
(Alright)
(If a record offends you, don't buy it)
I call it like I see it
(Go 'head)
(I don't try to make a friendly type of music)
I call it like I see it
(Alright)
(Won't ever worry ( ? ) I'ma use it)

[ VERSE 3 ]
People fought and died to make a better future for the youth
And many were killed for speakin the truth
Given too much game, gettin too close to home
Put a hit on you, snipers waitin with they scopes on
What do you expect for us to shut up and just let you kill us?
And teach the children that they came from gorillas?
I guess you figured if you kept us braindead you control us
Let us kill each other, then you call the rollers
Two at a time never fails
You send one to jail and tell the dead dude to go to hell
And you can send the black and whites out to hassle me
Tell me to shut up or I be another casualty
But your sweatin won't threaten me ( ? )
( ? ) we stand strong to the death and hard nothings
Just we like did ( ? ) we fought like men
You brought the guns and we been dyin every since then
As I rap I stare at the top of the roof
I shut my mouth or get shot for the truth
But I must take a stand to make a better future for people as equals
And call it like I see it

(Go 'head)
(If it means life or death)
I call it like I see it
(Alright)
(I will speak till my very last breath)
I call it like I see it
(Go 'head)
(When all odds are against me)
I call it like I see it
(Alright)
(The truth set me free)

(Funky)
