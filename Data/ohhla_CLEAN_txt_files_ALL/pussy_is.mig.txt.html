Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah..
Tell me that, that pussy is mine..
Yeah..
Keep it 100 baby, we both know..
I'm not the only one..
When I'm there..
You treat a nigga real good, and that's probably why I always cum..
Yeah..
So lie to me, lie to me, lie to me, so sweet..
Cause I don't ever want to imagine
All the other niggas like me
Ever had chance, to get in your pants
So..
Tell me that, that pussy is mines..
Yeah..
Tell me, tell me baby
Its all mines
Yeah
Tell me that, that pussy is mines
Ooohhh
Cause I don't want too believe anyone is just like me
Ahaha
Like me, yeah
Oohhh oh oh yeah...</pre>
