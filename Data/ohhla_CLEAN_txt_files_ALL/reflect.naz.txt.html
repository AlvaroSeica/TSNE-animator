[Kevlaar 7]
Enter the creation, devise secretion from the evening region
Amniotic liquid speaking through urethra squeezing
Breezing through pubes and fallopian tubes
Allegiance knew that my brother would bloom soon
Most of us coons, only the blackest Michigan whores
Prophets to be, little half breeds born into the arms of reality
'77 and '79, unconsciously infants we had conscious minds
Music babies entered the world through the pores of heard commodores
And much more resolved to my connected umbilical cord
Influence, hip hop congruent the love of music
Our mind states forced us to it
Dedication got our hearts racing, frenzy fans waiting
Destiny's mine, you so impatient, our graceful tongues aching
Pulsating with the tracks, impact's breaking lyrical backs
Y'all niggas think we pussy, I dare you faggots to dush me
I'm dirty, never keep a clean nigga close to me
Michigan, Unknown

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, break your spine, poor minds ready to climb
Brain fine blown, and leave  ___ lungs before they crack before the guns
After number runs sons, disco night in moms stomach
Looking at the blood running through the placenta
Sizing up this world I'm 'bout to enter
Fast-forward fifteen years later, spitting hot sprinters
Branded on the jail tour, he just planted like an asteroid
My beats bang on niggas heads until they beg for sin for it
My team grew and subtracted, blurry face, intergalactic
Flowing, the grates reacted on the moon face as I passed it
So underground it ___, I fell through a space passage
Asthma attack this, swinging from my uterine
On my umbilical cord until I drop into existence
Who ever knew this child in the egg was a gift
That would grow up and one day become a verbal blacksmith
