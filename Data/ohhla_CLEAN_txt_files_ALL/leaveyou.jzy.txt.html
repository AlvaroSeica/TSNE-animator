[Chorus: Ne-Yo] + (Young Jeezy)
Yeah, she said (she said) you ain't no good (no good) but you feel so good (HEY)
She said (she said), what if I could? But I gotta, leave you alone (YEAH)
(She said I) gotta leave you alone
I-I-I-I, she said (she said) I know you bad (you bad) but I want you bad (HEY)
She said (she said) makes me so sad that I, gotta leave you alone, yeah
(She said I) gotta leave you alone - I-I-I-I

[Young Jeezy]
Look, look, look look look
I got my mind on my money, all I need is a bad bitch (bitch)
That I can run through the city spend this cash with (no)
That I can run through this city spend this cash on (yeah)
Wake up in the morning get my smash on (ha-haaaa)
I don't want much baby egg whites (egg whites)
Keep your stomach and your thighs and your legs right (yeah)
While I'm out here focus getting this bread right (right)
But if the head right, Jeezy there every night (ha-haaaa)
Wake up in the morning and I'm still here (still here)
Wake up in the morning and I ain't gone (gone)
All I ask, let me just do me (me)
And maybe just me and you can get along (yeah)
Had them other bitches mad when they seen us (us)
Had them matching rolexes baby, team us
Yeah the earth is our turf we can share the world (world)
Maybe even go half on a baby girl

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
Look, look, look, look
Let me be your mind reader, let me read your mind (mind)
And when I'm done with the front, hit it from behind (YEAH)
Love a loyalty never cross the line (line)
Just hit a nigga up when I cross your mind (haha)
Show you how to get you on you won't be watching mine (shine)
Put you up on a g, show you how to shine (shine)
And maybe we can kick it when I got the time (time)
Be my back bone every nigga need a spine (YEAH)
Gotta know you ride with me if I'm right or wrong (wrong)
Case I wake up in the morning and it's all gone (gone)
Best believe I'ma get it right back (right)
Thats the hustler in me I know you like that (ha-haaaa)
You probably think I'm with a different broad every night (night)
When I think about it shit man you're probably right (right)
The more I think about it shit you're probably wrong (wrong)
Cause what you didn't think about is that I'm probably grown (YEAH)

[Chorus]

[Ne-Yo]
She said she wish she never met me cause she just can't help her let me 
go ahead and do whatever the hell I want
She said she hate how much she need me, turn around, and say she don't need me
Always talking about she gonna leave me, but she don't
But maybe this time might be different cause she shed so many tears
She'll remind me all the dumb shit that I've done over the years
But she don't be tripping in the morning, I got her legs up by her ears
But as soon as we get done, I swear this is all I hear, yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro: Young Jeezy]
103 baby!
True story though!  Yeah! YEAH~!
Warren G, you a fool for this shit homie
You know this the anthem right? Haha, yeah</pre>
