[MF Doom]
Slow it down some
No split, clown bum
Your gold hit sound dumb
Older now, crown him
Where you found them at? Got around town
Could of drowned in it
Would of floated, bloated, voted
Sugar-coated, loaded hip shooter
Draw for the poor
Free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw
None more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw
That dank sure stank lit
Sank passed the pit for more hardcore prank spit
Crank it on blast, roll past Front Street
Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

[Hook: Damon Albarn] 2X
Something started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well you know, November has come
When it's gone away

[MF Doom]
Baha, can you dig it like a spigot?
My guess is yes you can like can I kick it wicked
Liquor shot if you happy and you know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flowin'
Grope a pen and I'm in cope hymen
Doper rhymin' more worther than the Hope diamond
Acquired off the black market
A wire tappin' couldn't target a jar of spit
The rapid-fire spark lit
Zzt, a rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or dapper
Plug your trap or it's maximum exposure
The beast got family in numbers askin' 'em for closure
Aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em clean it
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong of Billabong
That said "Nah fo'real-a, the Villain on a Gorilla joint?"

[Hook: Damon Albarn] 2X
Something started today
Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well you know, November has come
It's gone away

[Outro: Damon Albarn]
When it's..
When it's gone away</pre>
