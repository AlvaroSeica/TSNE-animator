(*talking*)
Touch that iron enough times
Start realizing that it's, pretty hot
But at what point, do you stop touching it
Come on, you know it never works but you keep doing it anyway
Ha, you know it never world but you keep trying it anyway
Real question

[K-Rino]
Why do I indulge in thangs
That make it seem like, I'm in love with pain
Everybody speculating, why the rug was stained
Cause the sweat and tears dried, but the blood remained
Now I'm laying back, thinking bout my cousin mayn
I'm on some other sh...like when the subject change
And the moment that I walked inside, judgement came
Cause I ain't have a dozen chains, like club Elaine
I guess you could say, that I sacrificed some pay
Cause I chose not to sign, my whole life away
But anything in hindsight, seems suffice to say
And even a broken clock is right, twice a day
Now, my main affliction's a pain addiction
The same condition, but I won't change prescriptions
So by definition I'm insane, accustomed to scuffling
Cause only a fool keeps going back, to receive nothing

[Chorus]
I must have, a struggle addiction
Cause I won't change, my troubled existence
I'm still living, but something is missing
Keep doing the same thang, leading to the same pain
I really must, love this condition
Cause I won't find, another position
I'm too trifling, and stubborn to listen
You keep doing the same thang, leading to the same pain

[K-Rino]
Now despite people's envious ways, I'm feeling fine
Only dream that you seem to have, is killing mine
I showed love, they wasn't thinking about showing
While I was bringing them up, I was sinking without knowing
Enabling the slick harder, to make my life harder
As I'm saving them from drowning, they pulling me underwater
Dead weight brings you down, I wasn't knowing that then
It's best to cut a loose string, then trying to sew it back in
I blame me, for failing to move on
Only fools keep walking on glass, with no shoes on
Dedicated to my craft, it's been a turbulent ride
Sometimes it takes more away from me, then what it provides
Still I keep coming back to it, and taking a beating
Like a person who just won't leave, somebody that's cheating
And if your plans fell through a few times, let me tell ya
One of the main ingredients of success, is failure

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
Be true see through, every blatant and weak move
Deceitful people, Satan waiting to sweep you
Chase new breakthroughs, if you struggling make due
You can run forever, but you can never escape you
This learned behavior, was too vicious to discern
Never did you think, that your life would be taking this turn
Nothing to be trusted at all, even a kiss burns
Not knowing the feeling, of having something when it's earned
Sadly crafty, people seeking to grab me
Into the bottomless misery, bag try to add me
Plus you, now you in deep depression because you
Wondering, if anybody actually loved you
Turned rat, one that you trusted and done that
Once that happens, your confidence never comes back
Systems twisted, spiritually conflicted
But if you listening, then you in position to fix it
