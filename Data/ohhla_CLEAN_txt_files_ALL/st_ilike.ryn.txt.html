[VERSE 1] - [Ryan Leslie]
Uh uh...

Is it the accent, the hype or the way she walking
Am I, am I dreaming or am I sleep walking
Got my arms out-stretched so I don't bump into her
Silly me now I'm so into her fashion
To her style her dress
And im looking in the mirror like do I look fresh? do I?
Do I look fresh enough to get her,
If I see her one time then I wont forget her
Cause I... I took a picture mentally
when I pulled up in the black on black bent-a-ly and I...
I really feel like she was meant for me
If she wasn't then I know she was sent for me
Cause she.. shes the only one that made me chase
Got me singing love songs like Babyface
and I tried to one night her but she made me wait... she made me wait.. hah!

[CHORUS]
And so I think she got something, she got something
Yes she got something, something that I like (something I like, oohh she yeah)
So I think she got something, she got something
Yes she got something, something that I like
(ooooh, now break it down like)
She's got that something, shes got that something... that I like
(uh, say it again like)
She's got that something, shes got that something... that I like
(uh)

[VERSE 2] - [Ryan Leslie]
I slow it down 'fore I pick her up
Its 8 o'clock now we dating, inevitably dudes be hating
but I... I still gotta flaunt my chick
I laugh, no surprise that they want my chick
Shes... more than they can comprehend
British dudes idolize me they copy him
Hes just to witty, game is too gritty,
Look at his track record man, theres too many
Tens, thats too many to count
I spend, thats a any amount
No matter to sum homey got the cash to cover it
And when I wanna see she be fast to mother it
Yeah... just so she can take my ends
Would I let her to it hmm, well that depends
Can she raise a young king? my blood is royal
And if she can man it ain't a thing to spoil her

[CHORUS]
And so I think she got something, she got something
Yes she got something, something that I like (something I like, oohh she yeah)
So I think she got something, she got something
Yes she got something, something that I like
(ooooh, now break it down like)
She's got that something, shes got that something... that I like
(uh, say it again like)
She's got that something, shes got that something... that I like
(uh)

[Verse 3] - [Pusha T]
The CL's waiting just as soon as the plane lands
To ball on the city is the gameplan
Bottle service over here, money changes hands
Lanvin, broke niggas call 'em Ray-Ban's
Ughck! Champagne bubbles
Hot drunk girls more fun when they love you
Later for the days when I used to see double
The whole city know we's a power couple
Fly as she wanna be, never been a wannabe
Jealous hoes hatin' cause she everything they wanna be
Ughck! Give 'em what they wanna see
What's to talk about when the YSL is one of three
She don't gossip she just buy shit
All the same heels Rihanna rocks on Bossip
Any given Sunday is Project Runway
Something that I like and I gotta have her one day
Push... 

[CHORUS]
And so I think she got something, she got something
Yes she got something, something that I like (something I like, oohh she yeah)
So I think she got something, she got something
Yes she got something, something that I like
(ooooh, now break it down like)
She's got that something, shes got that something... that I like
(uh, say it again like)
She's got that something, shes got that something... that I like
(uh)</pre>
