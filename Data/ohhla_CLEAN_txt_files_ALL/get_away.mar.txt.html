[Terrace Martin]
Passport, bus pass
Plane ticket, first class
Long walks, far runs
Bike rides, make love
Make love, make love
Sunset, moon light
Fresh air, feels nice
Two of us, one mind
Leave the Mac at home, and the phone too
Let me hold you, and show you
And give you all my, attention babe
Attention babe, attention babe
Call your friends tomorrow, show the world out
You my girl now, my girl wow
Full body rubs, from head to toe
To your love below, skin glow
Let's get away, get away
Get away, get away

[Chorus: Neka LB Brown]
Let's get away, way, way
Let's get away, way, way
Let's get away, way, way
Ohh-ohh-ohhhhh
Ba-ba-ba-ba-baaaaaah 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-baaaaaah 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-waaaay
Ba-ba-ba-ba-baaaaaah 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-baaaaaah 
Ba-ba-ba-ba-waaaay

[Terrace Martin]
Champagne, I don't cook meals
No fa√ßade, you the real deal
Feelings, are real for you
Hand in hand, all eyes on us
Overlook the sea, I'm lookin at you
You're lookin back at me, what you're worth to me
Heh, is priceless, see I might just
I might just, wanna wife you
I like you, heh I love you
I love you, I love you

[Chorus]

[Terrace Martin]
Yo, let's get away, get away
Get away, get away
Leave the hate away, and get away
Bring the love back, let's get away
Let's get away, let's get away
Leave the hate away, let's get away
Let's get away, I love you babe
Let's get away, let's get away

[Chorus]</pre>
