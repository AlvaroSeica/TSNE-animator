[Intro: Trey Songz]
It's Mr Steal your girl
It's Mr Steal your girl
hey girl hey girl hey girl hey girl
let go

[Chorus]
Bottoms up bottoms up
ever see your cup
got a couple bottles but a couple aint enough
Bottoms up bottoms up
throw your hands up
tell security we bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up bottoms up
pocket full of green
girl you know I love the way you shake it in those jeans
Bottoms up bottoms up
throw your hands up
bottoms up bottoms up

[Trey Songz - Verse 1]
You know what it is girl we back up in this thing
money stay in my pocket girl I'm like a walking bank
tell me what you drink tell me what you think
If I go get these bottles we go alcohol insane

[Bridge]
calling all the girls do you hear me
all around the World city to city
Its cheers to the girls throw dueces to they guys
I got a chicken no goose in the ride
getting loose in the ride
hatin ass n-gga you can move to the move to the move to the side

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz - Verse 2]
My visions blurred
my words slurred
its jam packed a million girls
and I aint tryna leave though
we drunk so let me be your alcohol hero

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Can I get that 'Tron? Can I get that Remy?
Can I get that coke? Can I get that Henny?
Can I get that margarita on the rock-rock-rocks?
Can I get salt all around that rim-rim-rim-rim?
Trey? I was like, "Yo, Trey?
Do you think you could buy me a bottle of Rose?"
Okay, let's get it now
I'm wit a bad bitch, he's with his friends
I don't say hi, I say "Keys to the Benz"
"Keys to the Benz?" "Keys to Benz!"
Muf-cking right, yep weed to the ten
If A Bitch Try To Get Cute, I'ma Stuff Her
Throw A Lot Money At Her, Then Yell "f-ck Her!"
fuck Her. f-ck Her. Then Yell "f-ck Her!"
Then I'ma Go And Get My Louisville Slugger
Excuse Me. I'm Sorry. I'm Really Such A Lady
I Rep Young Money. You Know.. Slim.. Baby?
And We Be Doing Donuts While We Waving A 380
We Give A Lot Of Money To The Babies Out In Haiti
Yelling "All Around The World. Do You Hear Me?"
Do You Like My Body? Anna Nicki
Rest In Peace To Anna Nicole Smith
Yes. My Dear, You're So Explosive
Say Hi To Mary, Mary And Joseph
Now Bottoms Up &amp; Double My Dosage

[Chorus]</pre>
