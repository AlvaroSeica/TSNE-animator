Song:   How Beautiful
Typed by: iamhiphop757@hotmail.com

How beautiful are you?
You didn't think you were beautiful enough to say
I want to be loved
Not taken advantage of
You must have not known you are dove
Aflying far above dark valleys of tears and blood
Of those that know sex
And carnal pleasure
But not love
You didn't think you were beautiful enough to say
Don't talk to me like that
You didn't think you were beautiful enough to say
Don't touch me like that
You didn't think you were beautiful enough to have
Any position but on your back
You didn't even think you were beautiful enough to fight back
So you laid lifeless
As you innermost chambers were
Attacked and torn
And attacked and torn
You closed your eyes
Trying to find some place black and warm
Somewhere you are safe from the storm
Of the norm
Of beast holding from you legs neck and arms
As your innermost chambers are attacked and torn
Attacked and torn
You lie being thrown
From your back to your front to your side
From your back to your front to your side
Bare cold and naked and desperately trying to hide
And any sign of pride has been torn from your insides
And you can't even conjure up the emotion to cry
You don't even spend your time wondering why
You simply wonder
If you'll ever be a wife or mother
Or if you'll ever be gently touched instead of grabbed
Or if you'll ever be gently guided instead of dragged
Or if you'll ever be appreciated
[As] opposed to just had
You didn't think you were beautiful enough to say
I don't want to be raped
By the time you are ugly enough
To know that you were beautiful it will be too late
By the time you are ugly enough
To know that you were beautiful it will be too late
I swear by God you are beautiful
Don't wait until it's too late</pre>
