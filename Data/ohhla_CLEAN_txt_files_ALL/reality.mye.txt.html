We got a beautiful crowd in here tonight, hah, uh (turn me up now)
Ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to thank you for joining me on this journey (back again for the first time)
Splitting Image (new album)
I just wanna get one thing out of the way real quick (talk to 'em)
This is not a Supastition album (it's Kam Moye)
Leave your expectations at the door (that's right)
This is something new, Khrysis

I still dwell in the same residence but in a better place spiritually
Really not concerned if my peers can mirror me lyrically
That's straight schoolboy foolery (fanboy discussions)
The universe is soon to see how Kam Moye is hustling
No fifty cent dollars but proud of everything that I've done
Ironically these young bucks, I'm a far cry from
I'm cut from a different cloth, none of it is fabricated
Matter of fact don't label it an album, it's an affidavit
Come on field, refuse to lose a step
These labels handing out raw deals like a sushi chef (oh that's cold)
I used to wait for them labels to cake and break me off
To hell with paper chasing, I'm just letting nature take it's course
When my winning streak was colder than a whore's heart
I had to step up to the plate and knock 'em out the ball park
Those who don't fool with the music still know the dude smart
Peep the way I divided my career into two parts
I went from my parent's hand to Paris, France
From a bedroom studio to Stuttgart
I'm grinding homie, I know what time has shown me
Like Malcolm in Mecca, oh this is my defining moment
I had to switch it up, fix it up, bust a U-turn sharp
Did a three-sixty, found my own lane like an Earnhardt
Never bending off like Hasselhoff in a Camaro
But I'm coming back with everything, lock, stock and barrel, like what?

[Chorus]
I'm so ready for whatever that comes
They say your big shot, big break, you only get one
But I choose to disagree, I have only begun
They tried to tell me that it couldn't be done
So I gave 'em a reality check, it's a reality check
Don't be afraid of what I say, it's a reality check
It's a reality check, homie you got to respect
that I don't sugar coat, I'm handing out reality checks

[Kam Moye]
Welcome to the new chapter, the RSM crew captain
keeping you clapping whose rapping from the depths of his heart
I wanna touch people's souls, I don't know what you after
But you have to admit that Kam, he be repping it hard
And best of all, half-stepping ain't in my repertoire
Me and this south-inclined mouth of mine will never part
+Wrestle+ with pride but I'm still outspoken as Jimmy Hart
In this day and age, rappers want dollars for their penny thoughts
This game is so competitive like Duke and UNC
I'm feeling like Martin Luther lost in the {?}
They compensate beautiful but it ruins you and me
They say that the true emcee nowadays is like a truancy
Them act stupid for money fools should be unexcused
People are losing faith, I'ma take 'em Sunday school
Put on the Sunday shoes, lace 'em up comfortably
Cause we gotta put a stop to this monkey see, monkey do
I spit the ugly truth the way their drunken uncles do
When this revolution start we gon' see what kind of punk are you
Before I choose to set my generation back y'all
I'd rather take a few purple bruises or just get black balled
Brother what? They can't shut me up
You keep your lips like your cardigan sweater, both of them shits is button up
My words make you fear or gather respect
But this is what some people need, it's a reality check
From Kam Moye y'all

[Chorus]

[Kam Moye]
It's candy Kam y'all</pre>
