[Intro - Timbaland]
Hey girl; you're comin with me - your comin with me
Hey girl; you're comin with me - your comin with me
Hey girl; you're comin with me - your comin with me
Hey girl; you're comin... c'mon
Talk to me girl... got you stuck
On my elevator, get it up
On my uh-ohh, uh-ohh, oh-ohh

[Flo Rida]
Heyyyy!
My first flo' stuck on a golddiggin woman
Money cash flow all big face honies
Huntin on the pole got them D-boys runnin
Shorty got both broke, can't see what's comin
Wear them apple bottoms, wear them apple bottoms honey
Dolce and Gabbana and she get up on my money
Louis bag kit, Gucci, Fendi and Armani
See the karats on her wrist, now she pimp Bugs Bunny
Used to date Kanye, now she want me
And while I got the juice, wanna take my OJ
It ain't her birthday but her name on the cake
If I ever pay for nookie grade A

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Got you stuck (yeah) on my elevator (uh-huh)
Get it up (yeah) on my elevator - check it out!
My first flo', stuck on the golddigger
Second flo', stuck on the dimepiece
Third flo', stuck on the hoodrat
Fourth flo' - freak it, I don't know cause
This girl is/she's stuck on my ele, eh-el-eh-vator (frikki frikki)
This girl is/she's stuck on my ele, eh-el-eh-vator (frikki frikki)
This girl is/she's stuck on my ele, eh-el-eh-vator (frikki frikki)
This girl is stuck on my oww oww oww oww

[Flo Rida]
She got a nail kit, she got a hair kit
She got a Gucci bag, her brand new outfit
Stuck on my elevator, she on the second flo'
Now I want you to break it down, DJ turn it up some mo'
Hey, dimepiece girl turned to Internet hottie
Little momma got that Top Model body
South Beach peach go in the back of that Ducati
I'll bet you that brand new Ferrari

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida]
Heyyy, my third flo' stuck on the hoodrat gone
Cut tanktop, Hollyhood act wrong
Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone
Tattoo tight work, bump the "Low" ringtone
Bend the ghetto booty, bend the ghetto booty on her
Roll up with kitties, don't smoke Arizona
One night stand, one night with the clan
One night, one time broke her off ten grand
Project all the way, gutter all day
Pure uncut, stain wall with a J
Shorty don't fake, she'll put it in your face
Three stories while them hoodrats bass

[Chorus]</pre>
