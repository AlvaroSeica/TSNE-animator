[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
We spent so much dreaming
When we could be living.. WHOO!
(Out here whylin, don't give a fuck, see 'em wanna suck 'em up)
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams....
(WHOO!... WHOO!)
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams....
(Out here whylin, don't give a fuck, see 'em wanna suck 'em up)
I guess I'll catch you in your dreams...

[Big Boi]
Devils around my sun and my nights surround my days
Nocturnal creature by habit, Bruce Wayne know what I mean
I mean, I meant between sunset and sunrise
That's a dawn type of nigga for the home invasion
Surprise 'prise! Muthafucka, POW! POW!
Lay the fuck down, now! Naw, naw don't try to talk ya way out
Because I'm usually non-violent, positively vibing
but every now and then you gotta nigga wanna try ya
Why? I don't know, I don't even understand it
But it's simply overstood how you really 'pose to hand it
Pardon me one moment, I just went off on a tangent...
Ha ha ha...

[Chorus]

[Killer Mike]
Typical day off in the A (A!)
Buckets on the Chevrolet , aye!
Nigga wanna rob? Okay (okay!)
Ways staying that's where he lay (aye!)
Keep lookin at me with a gangsta grill
And I'ma give yo' ass a gangsta spill
That's a lil' piece of led, taken to the head
That nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead
Takin dirt naps, sleepin with the fishes
Done like dishes, it's a wrap like Christmas
Big Boi you say the word I'll make these niggaz dreams a nightmare
I will bust they motherfuckin head! {*starts laughing*}

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We ridin... killin... feelin... straight chillin
(Out here whylin, don't give a fuck, see 'em wanna suck 'em up, whoa!)
We roastin... boastin... flowin... straight coastin
(Out here whylin, don't give a fuck, see 'em wanna suck 'em up, that's the way of)
Keep spinnin... we grinnin... bendin... straight pimpin
(Out here whylin, don't give a fuck, see 'em wanna suck 'em up)
And we knowin... holdin... showin... controllin
(Out here whylin, don't give a fuck, see 'em wanna suck 'em up)

[Chorus]

[Janelle Monáe: repeat 'til fade] I guess I'll catch you in your dreams...</pre>
