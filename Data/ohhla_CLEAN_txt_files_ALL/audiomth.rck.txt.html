[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah, this your brother Raekwon right here
Roset special, what up?
Fourth floor, no doubt, corridor, it's filled with all kinda whores
(Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted to V-12 Benzes
The rush of audio meth it comes instant
Every breath I take I pay inches
So addictive, so addictive
I'm addicted, canary yellow diamonds
Chinese AK's that shoot silent
Most gangstas choose to die violent

[Raekwon]
Diamond up Eagle G, diesel weed slinging needles
Heroin drawer from my cerebral
Paint artist, lace you and started, and tarnish everything on you
Take you out your jewels, now undress
New York savages, hunt scavenges
Son, get his address, macking a Jag, the nigga asked for this
Play low, my killas, they say go
Catch him in snake mode, bite him, then jump in a gray boat
Dope verse fresh in the blow store, coming out heat first
So when we meet, it's a deep thirst
Winners take winners, we invest
Keep it on the up and up, just like Khaled, we the best, nigga

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
The Maybach parallel, see this caramel
Fly as Aramel, Killa Beez parasail
The luger black, the brick white
The boy brown, good night
Coupe red, streets dark
Scare snakes out the grass when the trees spark
Backwoods, no white boys
Moving white better look out for them white boys
Got a white Beemer, got a white six
White man's will to suck a big black dick
Got a nigga down the street down to murder something
Couldn't have nothing, shit now he work or something

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
