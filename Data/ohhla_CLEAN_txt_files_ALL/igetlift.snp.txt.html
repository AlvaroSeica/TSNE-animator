[Intro: Warren G]
Good morning niff-nods{?} and stoners
I would like to welcome you, to Nathaniel Hale High School
The home of the scholars, the home of the Impalas
And the home of the Rottweilers
I'm your counselor, Warren G

[Chorus: LaToiya Williams] + (Warren G)
I'm just - soakin up this breeze, smokin on some treeeees
(Smokin on this weed, this is all I need)
Smokin on this weed, this is all I neeeeed
(Smokin on this weed, this is all I need)
I get lifted, I get lifted - every day
I get lifted, I get lifted
I get lifted, I get lifted - every day
I get lifted, I get lifted - hey, hey

[Snoop Dogg]
Overzel' me, propel me, propeller
Cap peeler, rap healer, dope dealer
Rip it back, lick it back, now resealer
Exhaler, inhaler, fella
Juice is poured, deuces for
all you loudmouth bitches who adore
I can't play on your field anymore
Takin flight, now look at me soar
in and out of space with my foot to the floor
Higher and higher; I won't retire
{?}, love smokin fire
Tattle like satellite, all on the wire
Keep it up, speed it up, slow it up, throw it up
Your bitch is lookin at me cause she probably wanna go with us
It's cool with me, pop in, hop in
Ain't no stoppin, we keep knockin, rockin

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uh - dimes, dubs, quarter ounce, O-Z
Put it in a zag, let it burn slowly
Everywhere I am, nigga gotta blow tree
Rollin every gram, they be like "Holy
smokes, that man no joke
Can tell if it's that 'ehhh' if he don't choke"
Never gon' quit, every chance I'ma toke
Zip's smellin like the whole plant in my coat
Fam, I done smoked fans' weed and bought bags for autographs
Comin at me with all them names of what I gotta have
I got my own shit
And this ain't for a lil' kid, this grown shit
Havin a party at my crib, bring ya own bitch
I got three, so matter fact you can take one
Here go a joint baby girl let's bake one
Or take this weed and I can show you how to make one
Uhh (uhh)

[Chorus]

[Wiz - over Chorus]
Yeah~! Niggaz know I get lifted man
This high school man, I stay high
I mean, I don't gotta get high
I'm already there bitch
Yeah, I was high when I said that
Hm-hm-hm-hm, what up Snoop?
Ay nigga fuck that I'm comin to first lunch
Nigga I'ma be at all gyms too, fuck with me
Posted up, doin what I do
Ay good lookin on this one Warren
We needed this shit fool
I know you doin your thing all the way over across town
Servin them niggaz in private school...

[Outro: LaToiya Williams] + (Snoop)
I'm just - soakin up this breeze, smokin on some treeees
(I blame it on you, you blame it on me, we blame it on trees)
Smokin on this weed, this is all I neeeeed
(I blame it on you, you blame it on me, we blame it on trees)
I get lifted, I get lifted - every day
I get lifted, I get lifted
I get lifted, I get lifted - every day
I get lifted, I get lifted - hey, hey, hey, hey
(Yeah you know I'm lifted, I'm in this muh'fucker singin with her)
(Hahaha, yeah this my music class, man)</pre>
