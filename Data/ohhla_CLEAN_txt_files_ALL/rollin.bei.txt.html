Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I told her jump up in my car
Woo-ooh
And we was rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Woo-ooh
That's exactly what it feel like
When I watch her dance
Woo-ooh
Her body rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Woo-ooh
That's exactly what it look like

I said excuse me baby but your name is
Ain't you on TV, shorty ain't you famous
'Cause you up in the club lookin' like a angel, angel
Body lookin' ripe just like a mango, aye yo
Girl tell me what you got poppin'
What about this weekend we go Gucci shoppin'
She said boy I done peeped what yo game was
I said girl I just asked what your name was
Because you...
Gotta body like a video vixen
And you...
Got that antidote so gimme my prescription
(Unh huh) She like my style
(Okay) She show me love
Pulled up in that drop
Caught her walkin' out the club

I told her jump up in my car
Woo-ooh
And we was rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Woo-ooh
That's exactly what it feel like
When I watch her dance
Woo-ooh
Her body rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Woo-ooh
That's exactly what it look like

I said excuse me little sexy mama
Are you a voter, did you pick Obama
You see I'm only tryna make sure that you legal, legal
Body look like it could be lethal, lethal
(Hold up) Baby let me see that
See that cannot be real
I can't believe that
She said boy I done peeped where yo mind at
I said I'm a little faded never mind that
Because you...
Gotta body like a video vixen
And you...
Got that antidote so gimme my prescription
(Unh huh) She like my style
(Okay) She show me love
Had her screamin "yes yes"
You know how I does

I told her jump up in my car
Woo-ooh
And we was rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Woo-ooh
That's exactly what it feel like
When I watch her dance
Woo-ooh
Her body rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Woo-ooh
That's exactly what it look like

Yeah, Maejor
Unh
Tommy hits
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
She stopped movin' her booty
Keep goin' goin' goin'
She cold like it's snowin', it's snowin', it's snowin'
I got heart like Owen, Owen, Owen</pre>
