See you walking down the street you look so snappy
Come on baby baby don't you wanna make me happy!

I got I got to get alone with you
just to see what it is what it is that you do!
Oh baby I got I got to get alone with you
just to see what it is what it is that you do!

You're freaking me out you're number one the best
You're my birthday yeah you're my Christmas!

I got I got to get alone with you
just to see what it is what it is that you do!
Oh baby I got I got to get alone with you
just to see what it is what it is that you do!

My brain starts to stutter cause you pop up in it every second
You say you got a girl, call me the homewrecka
And I ain't lyin cause I don't give a fuck
I push the girl right outta the door and wish her good luck
And listen kid you count yourself lucky
You got a blowpop cause I want candy
I got to get alone with you, 24/7 I wanna be on top of you
And yes yes you will be mine all mine
You got a Timex, check it, in 5 minutes we'll be making time
I'm in my prime check it out full grown
Why don't you be McCauley, we could be home alone
I'm not tryin' to tease you I just have to explain
I'm gonna please your body, right and left side of your brain
Yeah it's like that

Now it's gettin kinda late and I really don't feel like waitin
What's the season?
Matin'
I'm packing lots of heat and I ain't talkin' 'bout a gun
Come and take your Mazerati for a test run
Guaranteed for speed but warranteed for a long time
Come on and check the merchandise
I want ya uh uh I want ya
You surprised?

My strawberry's ripe for the pickin'
Not like the colonel but I'm sure finger lickin' good
You're like a paper factory with all of that wood
Could you be mine, would you be mine, won't you be my lover
I gotta get with you see what you do, 'cause baby there ain't no other

I got I got to get alone with you, I got I got to get alone with you</pre>
