(Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Clip)
"But I am different, I want it more than any of them!"
"You'll get your chance. One day things will change."
"When? When will they change?"
"Probably when you least expect it..."

Put that pixel in your mind and it might come true..

[Chorus]
It ain't over here it comes again
Holdin on my shoulder so I cant hold it in
Life in a balance seein how we did(?)
An when you get there its time to go again

[Eligh]
Sifting through your imprints brings me to this
Never let go never give up hope cause thats it
If I let go of hope and fall in the pit of injustice
Its just not right high plane drift into the light
Sharing my thoughts on the spot so there was never no secrets
She was ever clever so decent
So adequate for my etiquete
So I let it hit the bottom of my head and its
A dead page in a story thats been told so many times in the scroll
That I keep going for control
Beautified, intensified
Colors hide in the backdrop, who am I to supervise
Or pitch over the backstop
Simplified, compromised
Flowin under the lifelines cause you an I is a suicide
I testified in the right lines
A designer outline of your features in my sketchbook
Take a look at my past an answer questions your askin
Fasten seatbelts for the whiplash is massive
Crashin into the brick wall I barricaded my ass in
Fascinated by beauty
To document it to my duty
Artistry come alive in my eyes cause your my moving-
Picture, pixelating kaleidescope
Highest hopes I could ever match
Titilating my mind to cope with any problem that shows his face
No disgrace, no embarassment, never care for opinions in your presence
Your the second half to my essence
Your life is so intoxicating
To a drunken skinny broken open wide guy
Cause Im siftin through your imprints, it brought me to this
Never let go never give up hope cause thats just it
If I let go of hope and fall in the pit of injustice
Its just not right high plane drift into the light

(It ain't over here it comes again...)

[Grouch]
Her blowin have me growin, knowin I hit the jackpot
Silky symmetrical, round juicy sexual
Too acceptable, smellin like watermelons
Tellin all my friends about her every limb
Theres no comparison
Her hair in the wind got men sniffin wishin they could be in my position
I paid my dues though, now I move slow along the curb smooth ride
Back up fool you cannot drive
I make my dreams come alive
Exotic non-narcotics getting me high
Waterfall visions, covergirl missions
Soundtrack to her would be some smooth Loni Listen (?)
Me Im like a piston but Im not dissin
She holds herself well an I respect that
Listen if theres one thing I know its go for what you do
I did its all true
Neglected to way too cool
On the low standards Im a planner you a player what lay
Let me take (?)


[Chorus]

[PSC]
Flew off the scale of one to ten when the skin tone was in
Perfect light, candlelight, or the lamps you can dim
With the twist of a knob, don't claim to be a hearthrob
But I had my fair share of times Ive had to move on
And ask you why you dot a million desks
Most can only dream of the girls that found my rest
Beautiful creatures that stay without the reaches
To live in seclusion they made at the beaches
Exotica eroticas never rock the Nautica
Maybe some Prada and extra cool with nada
Nuthin, but get em naked an flawless
Wake up they look good (?)
And I think back, whens the last time you seen a Legend
Bare with somethin blessed let me help you out never
It may seem callous and shallow forgive me
I meant it, fly girls look like equipment
Top of the line helps the product come tight
Watch we pooled the girls that make the good whites
And life is so bland when youre already the man but you really ain't the man
Now my people understand what Im sayin
Im just layin back no approach
An when I be out with wifey best believe shes the dopest
Or one of the dopest, so many to hold focus
The young crop to make jaws drop then laws broken
Just jokin, statutory thats another story
Hormones an food got youngsters ripe for bonin
Ownin, oh Mr. Mackin continues
Stars in tight clothes be huntin us at venues
An then proves competition ain't friendly
We got the quality, quantities empty
Loyal untouchable drawers that y'all will never see
But give us a shot at your girl, theyll probably fuck with me

[Chorus]

[Scarub]
With beauty comes duty, few see the filthy
Not guilty I had to pass ass
Got me wantin somethin that ain't worthy
Surely I can see through most wannabes watch friends change up
Relationships, bitches wit attitudes come out quick
What you think you got somethin shit
Not this, Im gettin pissed again
Wished again some bliss'll get no kisses when eternity
Such absurdity I thought words would be the gate to my heart
Burnin me, but Ima stay cool as Sammy Davis an ride this shit out
But you cant lie this shit out
It used to be hard just to write this shit out
But I usually have ta fight this shit out
But Ima live this shit out
Like bein locked up for 30 years
Walk out with a hand of cement tears
Weird ta be out in the car seein the world
Got picked up by a girl an you see the lights pull you over in the rear
Radar clock 90 Im gonna have to see everybody I.D
I thought I was free but I really did a 360

(See I just got out an um, see...)

[Chorus]</pre>
