[Intro: Sample]
And now ladies and gentlemen, The Coco Cabana is proud to present

[Myalansky]
My thug tonsil, Weight like a mobster
Fucking Sinatra couldn't even come close, You niggas imposters
Eating at the table with the bosses, Planning extortion
Do this shit to see my face up in the source kid
Myalansky hit Siegel off to start the Flamingo
The reason fiends inject their arm with the diesel
Mosquito down fly gangstas, Kid we do this for real
Tryna get bricks flew from Brazil
Cause'n terror, Black shade Govera, Pa
I'm far from Cuban, Pull the purple out ya jaw you stupid
Never catch like Pablo Escobar, Test the God
Send head busters where you rest, It's on
Keep lawyers on the payroll whose jewelry is flooded with stones
Up in the court room, Cases get thrown
Paparazzi snapping pictures thinking that it might be the feds
They want me dead or do life in the pen

[Goodfellas Sample]
You took the first pinch like a man
And you learned the two greatest things in life
What, Look at me, Never rat on your friends
And always keep your mouth shut

[Myalansky]
Snitches get exterminated, Bodies found floating in rivers
While I'm steady putting dope in Virginia
Broke bread with the Mexicans in Cali
Peace Tyreef, I know some bloods who do flex'n in Denali's
Conversate'n bout deals, Cribs out in Beverley Hills
I'm tryna live next to Stephanie Mills
Hit the Hard Rock Cafe, Sipping on Pina Colada
Casino dice tricking Gs in Nevada
Continental Breakfast, Room service at the hotels suites
You niggas broke what you gone tell me
You gotta have chips in this game
That's how you live the life of luxury
Investment in stock of foreign companies
Executive status, Cutting checks on test to the islands
Civilized thug cats who was while'n
Put em in positions, Soon as they come home from prison
I want the thrown where Al Capone was sitting

[Joe Mafia]
The rat pack extravagant, Blood oath, Toast to the fliest
Penalty's death, Cotton self, A club thug
Music and drugs, Nascars, Czars and Dona Somia
Briefcase, Ace five, Cash or diamonds, (Nuttin move)
Politic'n over some White Russian
LA to flush'n, Illegal network, Shit'n on customs
Grams of raw when the ??? ???, Evian, Avalanche blow
James Bond whips of Chaka Kahn, A fiasco
Castro polls, chopped cigars, Strategic
My alligence is crime ward, You see em
Silk blowing in a tropical breeze, Keys of Key West
Custom Bap Tees in Belize, G-5 jets
Remote control safes, Bank all status, We lamp'n
Rhymes in the house of the Coco Cabana
Deals signed and sealed, Payroll judges and jakes
Pop the bottles yo we Goodfellas</pre>
