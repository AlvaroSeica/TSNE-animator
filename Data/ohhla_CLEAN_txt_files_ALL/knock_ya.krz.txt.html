[Intro]

[Tech N9ne]
Yeah I'm proud to be apart of this number hahaha
Hey yo Kali Kill 'em!

[Krizz's Kid]
Hey daddy start playin one for Krizz
You know they can't hold you!
Kali Baby!

[Verse 1 - Krizz Kaliko]
Now Aiy-yai-yai Knock Ya Wig
Kali Baby! Krizz Kaliko drop that big
Tecca Ninna protoge and side kick
That's why your girly wanna do me and she suck me pick [?]
Nigga's is irrelevant
Industry I'm an elephant!
And I don't swat flies
At guys for the hell of it
Mad cause of the mil' I get
And If I mention your name maybe your celibate
And we can hear you when your yelling this! (Shut up!)
Still babbling badder than half of you rappers
Mah' nigga that's why we be travelin'
We batter a thousand of them
We cracker a crackas and eat em with chowder
That just happened but we've been crackin' heat slapping
With Robert Thin tracking
We fact that you slacking
Around the world and back in
Your neighborhood you trapped in
Tech names and take in package?
We need a chin strap in
Don't make me tell you again cause if I do
I might just smack the hair off your chin and I

[Chorus]
Ay-yai-yai Knock Ya Wig!
Ay-Ay-Ay-yai-yai Knock Ya Wig! [x7]

[Verse 2 - Krizz Kaliko]
Now look-ee look-ee look-ee hear
Look here shorty got back
She got a humpa'
She's a jump off
She skinny but fatt
As for a biker and get my pant off
And she runnin back a real one
I eat her lunch off
And save us a snack
Kali Baby!
See I'm 'bout that life
And my shows have been about yo wife
See I'm a gutterer
And she's about that knife
She ain't a groupie
Yeah I doubt that! Right?
How bout I loose up your pooper shooter
Lay 'em down and she mount that fight
Put up her bootie smoothie
I'm beggin so I can be choosy
Smoke L's why'll you do me
She inhale right through me
I don't know you well
You might kiss and tell
The whole movie pop the top off your lip
Knockin the wig off of a groupie

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Krizz Kaliko]
Now Ima' address
All you internet rappers at one time
Fuck a battle rapper
I can kill you with one line
Disrespectin is effortless you
Fuck with me fuckin with the best
Difference is you don't get no publishing checks
I DO! (OKAY!)
He'd better n' check his vitals
Cause strange music entitled
To be everyone's idols
Just got a deal with harley davidson cycles
Your youtube views is not that big!
Kali baby knock that wig!

[Chorus with auto-tuned doodles]
Kali Baby
Yeah bitch!</pre>
