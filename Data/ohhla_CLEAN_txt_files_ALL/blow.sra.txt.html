[Sun Rise Above]
Do it for rapid movement toward a human community
Actually tracks in place are just makin a case for unity
In the face of gratuity try to make an annuity
Politican for screwin me you ain't granted impugnity
Naked hatred for capital, makin papes when they shackle you
Jackin you for your revenue, living upon a pedestal
That's why I'm heretical, got a modern poetical
Locked within they grip 'til we rippin up all they tentacles
Ventin, never mechanical, ran inside a botanical
garden parden the mandible hardened like I'm a cannibal
Never bitin a man but I'm hikin like a banana boat
Blisters inside my sandals, I covered more land than Hannibal
Seekin to understand how they sneakin inside the frequency
Keepin me off the radio recent frequently peepin me
Telescopin they open hopin that you never hear about
the doper flow, I just let it go, then I air it out
Blow~!</pre>
