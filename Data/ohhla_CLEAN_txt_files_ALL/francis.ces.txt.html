[Ceschi]
Look I died on you again - cause you killed, cause you killed
Break a leg Francisco False - break a leg, or any limb
It's impossible to win, anyway you look at it
Someone's gonna lose their head

Here's a shoutout, to the daughters
Who have played with your dumb heart
Like a Slinky sinking sideways
Down the bottomless stairwell
This one goes out to the women
Who tore open your tear ducts
And laughed.. as your frown was on dis-play</pre>
