[Breez Evahflowin - Verse 1]
Aiyo My Man Told me Stan Walks The Earth No More
He heard it from sharone and mo on four fo
Now Big Toe claimed he wanted name on the tell
So don told him to stail, baby, walking on bail
It begins like wind to sails
A mans breathe, moves death steps closer to the next from assumption
The average function
Follow the code of the barbe-que
You don't bother me and i don't bother you
By the two turn tables, lives the fable himself
Brotha stands death cheatin' eating good for his health
Was it an apperception, our focus passed all the supersition
The mission, define toe tried to make him listen
Condition critical, can not prevent the blowup
Cause toe is tow (slang) up
And now dale had to show up
{flossin} this situation happens often
New York, LA, Or Boston always ends up in a coffin
Or stranded often, cause dale's dime piece, got nine weeks
To turn, but toe got the payback to earn
Busting loud, me a stan rushin through the crowd
Somehow, street trial has an ill way of ended up
Enough time for toe mind to clear
Dale's still alive i'm standing here
STAN, my man you heard was dead
Been confirmed by toe, from a stray to the head
What You Said

[Breez Evahflowin - Verse 2]
When you say what you said analyze the fact
Now i heard you got snuffed for that yak-i-ti-yak
Being black plus broke, lands folks to run jibbs
Especially with these teenage kids
Who heard that the crew down the block that work down packed
I heard it from will caught the scoop from nat
Who cats often neglect, when they search for truth
Stories be lackin proof that get over on the youth
I heard he had those juveniles gas for the taken
Parlayin on the papers they ain't makin
How them jamaican cats got em' shakin
And shorty's pullin chrome when they dome started bakin
Taking the risks, runnin down the block with death of the fist
The grossness calculation 
Not only was it workplace but also homestation
The only thing them shorties got was lots of chrome tastin
Runnin home facin fear, with a posse of gondeleto's pawn the rear
Becareful with yo peoples and yo peers
So i hear it said and believe it true
The only way to stop the word is at you
My lips stay statue stiff unless seen
My word the ya way my way, na'mean
