Bom bom bom bom...

Life is a test
And you're done

Testin' me
My God is stressin' me
My destiny
That perhaps so hard to see

In the morning when I rise
Every days on new surprises
Or blessin' in the skies
And even though this world grow cold
As you always hold
A place in my heart
For me you gave me my star

Can this be
This world is history 
Why must we be
So bloody crazy
God help me see
Is testin' me
This world is stressin' me

Yeah

C'mon

Testin' me (testin' me)
My God is stressin' me
My destiny
Meant that perhaps so hard to see

It's testin' me
It's testin' me
Why is it stressin' me
Yeah
And so it seems
Is fallin' apart at the seems
And all of my dreams will never ever be seen

Yeah

As I wipe the tears from my eyes
You ask me why do I cry
As the days go back more and more that

It's so heavy
No no 
It's so heavy
It's testin me

Testin' me (testin me)
My god is stressin' me
My destiny
Meant that perhaps so hard to see

Bom bom bom bom...</pre>
