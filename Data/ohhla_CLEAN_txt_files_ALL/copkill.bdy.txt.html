[Ice-T]
COP KILLER! YEAH!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
I got my black shirt on
I got my black gloves on
I got my ski mask on
This shit has been too long
I got my twelve guage sawed off
I got my headlights turned off
I'm about to bust some shots off
I'm about to dust some gats off!
[Chorus: Ice-T]
I'm a.. COP KILLER!! better you than me
COP KILLER!! Fuck police brutality!
COP KILLER!! I know your family is grieving, but FUCK THEM!
COP KILLER!! But tonight we get even, HA HA!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I got my brain on hype
Tonight'll be your night
I got this long-ass knife
And your neck looks just right
Now my adrenaline is pumping
I got my stereo bumping
I'm about to kill me something
A pig stopped me for nothing!

[Chorus: Ice-T with variations]
COP KILLER!! Better you than me
COP KILLER!! Fuck police brutality!
COP KILLER!! I know your mamma's grieving, FUCK HER!
COP KILLER!! But tonight we get even, YEAH!!

[Hook: Ice-T]
DIE, DIE, DIE, PIG, DIE! (* Multiple Gunshots*)
FUCK THE POLICE!! FUCK THE POLICE!!
FUCK THE POLICE!! FUCK THE POLICE!!
FUCK THE POLICE!! FUCK THE POLICE!!
FUCK THE POLICE!! FUCK THE POLICE!!
YEAAHH!!

[Chorus: Ice-T with variations]
COP KILLER!! Better you than me
I'm a.. COP KILLER!! Fuck police brutality!
COP KILLER!! I know your family is grieving, FUCK THEM!
COP KILLER!! But tonight we get even, HA HA HA!! YEAH!!
