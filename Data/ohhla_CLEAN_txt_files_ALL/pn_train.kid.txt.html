Fifteen years on this lonely road
I paid my own way, I carried my own load
I never asked too much from no one, I was much too proud
All I ever wanted was to play my music for a sold out crowd

Bitches, money, fame, they say I had it all
Six foot one, I walked around like I was ten feet tall
Did you see me shine
Where the hell are you now, Detroit city back in '99
Stoned out of my mind

On that rock n roll pain train, I had to slow things down
I live out in the woods now, it helps me keep my feet on the ground
Life's been good to me so far, hope it's been kind to you
Stand strong in the storms of life, the sun will always shine on you

Now I've been rolling on love and lust
I ride around on this million dollar bus
But this bus is just a bus, man, I can't sleep at night
Man I miss my babies and I'd really like to fuck my wife
But she ain't here tonight

On that rock n roll pain train, after the lights go down
I live out in the woods now, it helps me keep my feet on the ground
Life's been good to me so far, hope it's been kind to you
Stand strong in the storms of life, the sun will always shine on you

I've seen this train wreck time and time again
I felt it's pain, I've seen it take my friends
You've got to stop and take a look man, or life will pass you by
Get you a guitar and a good song, that's all you really need to ride

On that rock n roll pain train, I can't slow it down
The music and the whiskey, don't it make you wanna get loud
Life's been good to me so far, hope it's been kind to you
Stand strong in the storms of life, the sun will always shine on you
The sun will always shine on you</pre>
