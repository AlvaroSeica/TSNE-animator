Song:   Crazy Like a Fox
Typed by: @QuezThePoet

The mad rapper, not mad as in angry
Mad as in crazy, crazy like a fox
I am paradox wage war to make piece
Open for debate but don't mistake for hate speech

When I say fuck the other side they hold no weight with me
When they motivate a base that honors criminals and greed
They call em forefathers I call em fourty thieves
They way they plunder for a nation and for them they drink tea
And throw parties I think they need some coffee
To wake up and tell em mother fucker it's a shake up
Fuck your philosophy of trickle down science
Claim to be defiant but you rally for the giant
Sponsored by Goliath claim that David's your name
Facilitated by Fox News grass roots no ya ain't
And with them racist undertones I can't be convinced
If this is America then I'm no patriot
And Gripp don't tell em that you're atheist
Because they wear them halos tighter then Gabriel every did
I think it's blocking circulation to their brains
But don't mind me I don't know what I'm saying

I just the mad rapper, not mad as in angry
Mad as in crazy, crazy like a fox
I am paradox wage war to make piece
Open for debate but don't mistake for hate speech

When I say fuck the other side innovate please
Demonstrate you're more than just a trend on TV
Imitate what monkey see monkey do
Monkey make a mockery and monkey Mantan "YOUUULLL"
Crank that jigaboo Superman that hoe
Don't forget the Auto Tunes when it's time to sing the slow parts
Oh art thou just more of the same
That's why them old school emcees is getting board with the game
And newcomers think they all Big Meech
And say don't talk to police yet I can smell the pig feet
On their breath what a feat how the vets critique
And disrespect their rep yet their requested on repeat
And they wear them tight jeans cause it's all about the photo op
Kiss dudes now they screaming no homo, stop
I know I know I'm just a hater busting chops
They out making that paper I should give them their props

But I'm the mad rapper, not mad as in angry
Mad as in crazy, crazy like a fox
I am paradox wage war to make piece
Open for debate but don't mistake for hate speech

When I say fuck the other side; we're here to gatekeep
tell MCs to vacate. They can take unpaid leave
Maybe if they weren't so concerned with making some crap to sell
then they could get back to rapping well. Here's a question you should ask yourself
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
If Romney said that, you would prob'ly have an ulcer, dude
See 'em on TV all grinning their teeth wide
no album just a single with twenty-two B-sides
You'll see why they need a hit off that peace pipe
like B-rock right after a drone strike that's precise
like an elected rapist who's stifling legislation
with hands over his wife's face during the penetration
Look, don't mistake it for compassion. It's a racket
less a campaign platform than sexual harassment
another intern under the desk while they're laughing
while they garnish your wages for tanks and planes and call it taxes

Well I'm the mad rapper, not mad as in angry
Mad as in crazy, crazy like a fox</pre>
