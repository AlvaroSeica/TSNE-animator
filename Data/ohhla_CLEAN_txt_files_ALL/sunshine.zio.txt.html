"We are scientists of sound."
"Mathematics puttin' it down."
"Come and go"
"It's time you learn to see"

[Verse One]
Now we ready to bounce and
Bubble large amounts and
Never do we shout and
Turn the party out in
A quick rush
Microphones we bust
Put a hush upon the crowd
Hope we come up with the style
Feelin' unique
Smooth upon the beat
Make your queen get hot while you fidget in your seat
We don't, sweat or fret
Any competition
The only competition is me
I'm on a mission
To get the jewels
Not material
As I slip into my trance, it's the G.O.D. that pulls
All of the verbs and
All of the nouns
We be profound leavin' them sound boys soundin' deep down
Cause we're poetic
Sucks get dreaded
Best that you jetted out the back in your Cadillac
We be akin to 
Bullshit, I've been through
If you
Understand put your damn hands
Up in the air
Like you don't care
Now, give me mo' love it don't flicker with the fear
It goes

[Chorus]
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
Yo, we motivate while your mind state climbs
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
DJ's with the techniques, bump it in the streets
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
Yo, we motivate while your mind state climbs
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
DJ's with the techniques, bump it in the streets

[Verse Two]
Na na na
Now in this hip hop shit
Best again come equip
I do a back flip
Then BAM!
Feel my side kick
To your lip then
To your middle section
Holler out to God cause you need some more protection
My lethal weapon
Is stashed in my cranium
In the new millennium
Suckers I be drainin' 'em
I'm rainin' down so ride on my thunder
Strike on my lightening bolt, the 7th wonder
I'm in your populace
I'm poppin' this
Huntin' around, railroad style, metropolis
I'm droppin' this
Gem
Like a herring
Super friends I make you say, "Amen"
Raw it's not lost, so dip in my car
Relax and kick back, we bump old Gang Starr
For sure, mature, insight
Deep into the night
My man, meditate on beats
I rhyme right 
Yo

[Chorus]
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
Yo, we motivate while your mind state climbs
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
DJ's with the techniques, bump it in the streets
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
Yo, we motivate while your mind state climbs
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
DJ's with the techniques, take 'em to the streets baby

[Verse Three]
I'd rather just rock rhyme
Meditate, avoid swine
And dine upon the spiritual crimes of evil minds
Let me tell you somethin'
Don't you know that you was blessed?
Headed upon the earth to manifest
And nothin' else to do
Chillin' with my crew
In the O-A-K, spit verbs and drop jewels
I stay cool and break rules
Take 'em to school
In the place to be
Mic checka one two
I use tools to bring news
Spirit is few
Did you really wanna battle? 
Come on, then let's do
You bring clips and gats
Pimps with fat hats
I bring me and A.M.P. the M.P.
And black wax to scratch
Beats and hand claps
Your face will get slapped
If we start to rap
Like that, rejected
You've been selected
Busta Of The Year
Next time you'll respect 

[Chorus]
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
Yo, we motivate while your mind state climbs
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
DJ's with the techniques, bump it in the streets
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
Yo, we motivate while your mind state climbs
Sunshine, beats and rhymes
DJ's with the techniques, take 'em to the streets baby</pre>
