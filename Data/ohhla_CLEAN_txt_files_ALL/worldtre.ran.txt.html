[Verse 1]
My methods take heads back like Sam Beckett
Respected for the angle I bring to the game
So my name resonates and reverberates
Play the game till I get the service ace, like the murder rates
My intellect gained me a lot of respect
But you haters need a muzzle for the side of your neck
If you're about progress, we gotta connect
Tax cats like funds coming outta your check
See we try to get that global acclaim take over the game
Have the whole world knowing the name
Kyle put the beat on, so Ran put the heat on
Reppin' till infinity and beyond, we on
Another level like 7th gen, we never been
Scared to forcefeed cats that medicine
Plug your headphones up then let us in
We used to get it in, blowing on connector pins

[Chorus]
it started with the roots then we take it to the trunk
Branches to jazz to punk rock to funk
The seeds are the leaves that blow through the breeze
And thus the completion of the world tree (2x)

[Verse 2]
I'm like colt seavers, but don't tote heaters
Don't smoke neither, cd, no features
Left the block and beat all the odds
Who's the boss? I left Jon Charles in charge
So we felt the growing pains, took the slower lanes
Give me a break? I'd overdose Novocain
Perfect strangers, I never did know her name
Now we bosom buddies, cause family matters
Moonlighting as a 30 something rapper
It's a different world, they say you wont be a factor
Cause the rap game's like a full house
Everybody wants a dynasty since the greats rolled out
The wonder years are long gone
You need a New Heart to compete or you gotta strong arm
We got family ties, life goes on
Knotts Landing on the dome, but we still hold on

[Chorus 2x]

In the beginning, it started with the DJ
He looped the breaks so we could hear the beat play
And while it played, the b-boys danced
And the poppers popped and left the crowd in a trance
Eventually the parties started to grow
And they needed someone to control the flow
A cat picked up the mic, and that's when it happened
He started scatting and later it was called rapping
Then it got bigger than they ever imagined
It turned into street education and fashion, and
Now the little shorties say it all the time
And a whole bunch of them swear they know how to rhyme
But the mystery, is the history
And with it than we could see consistency
Cause back in the days it was all good fun
Might mention a gun, but nobody had one
And now they say its out of control
A tree grew in the Bronx and it spread across the globe
Too big to knock it, too thick to chop it
Tell me who profits, we can't even stop it

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
