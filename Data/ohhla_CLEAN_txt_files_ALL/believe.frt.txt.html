[Chorus]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If ye don't want to ye don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Cause you should know now your own now believe me

[Ryu]
I don't wanna be the one to blame
You like fun and games keep playing em
I'm just saying back then you was like one of the same
On the wright track but I was on the wrong train
Its like that now ye gotta face the pain
And the devil has got a fresh new place to play
And in ye brain like a maze you can never escape the rain
Every damn day is the same shit

[Mike]
Hey, I use to have a little bit of plan
Use to have a concept of where I stand
But that concept slipped right out of my hand
And now I don't really even know who I am
Yo what do I have to say maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you we'll see but its not gonna happen with me

[Chorus]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If ye don't want to ye don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Cause you should know now your own now believe me

[Mike]
Back then I thought you were just like me
Somebody who could see all the pain I see
But ye proofed to me unintentiantly
That you would self destruct eventually
Now ill be making like the mistake I made doesnt hurt
But its not gonna work cause its really much worse
Then I thought I wish ye was something you were not
Now this gift is really all that I got

[Tak]
Ye turn ye back and walk away saying all ye got is the memory and the pain
Nothing makes sense and ye stare at the ground
And hear my voice in ye head when no one else is around
What do I have to say maybe I should do what I have to do to break free
And whatever happens to you we'll see but its not gonna happen to me

[Chorus]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If ye don't want to ye don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Cause you should know now your own now believe me

[Chorus]
I guess that this is where we've come to
If ye don't want to ye don't have to believe me
But I won't be there when you go down
Cause you should know now your own now believe me

I'll do what I have to do
Your own your now believe me
Whatever happens to you
Your own your now believe me
What do I have to say
Your own your now believe me
Is not gonna happen to me
Your own your now believe me</pre>
