Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: 9th Prince]
Another Gooch productions, what, yeah
My people's Q on the boards
Once again, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Chorus 2X: 9th Prince]
We that team that loves to scheme, and
Everybody move they body, and
9th Prince about to shoot up ya party, and
Go and tell a friend, go and tell a friend

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, we always doing crime, half my Army doing time
Sit back, and let ya mind incline, first degree, murder rhymes
Throwing signs, iller than cocaine lines
Like the sun I shine, my next album
Is selling for two dimes, that's twenty dollars
Back in '89, I was popping ya'll niggas collars
I tried to crossover, it didn't work
Revenge of 9th Prince, now I'm back in the dirt, yo
Celebrity Deathmatch, all-star squadron
Magnificent men, Park Villa was the dungeon
I was only 11, performing live like a reverend
Little gangsta raps, so I represented the seven
Now surrender like unarmed ninjas
Shaolin finest avengers, born beginners
Turn winners with the sinners, I'm serious as a heart attack
You like the way my guns clap, only the streets can adapt to killa raps

[Chorus 2X]

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, tortureous flows, keep me on my toes
Sharp like my little brother elbows, promo shows
Shootouts everywhere, bullets flew through his Kangol
Return of Madman, shot up the front row
Lockdown all exits, kidnap promoters
Sold bottles of coke, and I ain't talking about cola
Staten Island soldiers, bulletproof Range Rover
Four dot six, so when you see me coming
Prepare for the crucifix, my niggas is sick
Like the Exorcist, dusted out on Stapleton park benches
Poetry sentence, blow holes in ya keyboard sequence
My mind is my defense

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: 9th Prince]
Yeah, once again, the 9th Prism get up in 'em
With the rhyme rhythm, word up
Shout out to my whole Killarm', Staten Island, what up</pre>
