[Intro: Funkmaster Flex]
Niggas always tryin! Heh Heh Heh Huh Huh!
SHUT UP!!!! SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!
HA HA HA HA HA HA!!! GRRRRRR!!!!! Canceled!
Heh Heh Heh Heh! GRRRRRRRR!!!! HA HA!!!!
'Bout to cancel! Heh! FUNK FLEX! J. COLE! YEP!

[J.Cole]
Eh Em! Hey! Yeah!

[Verse One: J. Cole]
Maine of fire my empire be higher
Than the octave on Mariah you niggas should worship sire
Your crew holdin dead weight like a fuckin hearst's tires
Meanwhile I'm like the flow diversifier verse is flyer
Gave you truth, at a time when niggas prefer the liars
I was David promisin the world that I'm a serve Goliath
Then I, swam with sharks made it to the land in part
My dick in bitches with intentions sick as Satan's worst desires
Uh! Hell of an intro, speedin through this life
At a, hell of a tempo with my head out the window
20K in my pocket as I'm feelin the wind blow
And I ain't have a wallet since Nintendo, comprendo
Orchestratin these capers watch my paper crescendo
I use to wanna save the world now all I do is spend dough
'Til I, snap back like Hov hat
Now I'm back with this big black strap like hold that
HUH! BLAOW!!!!

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Maine on fire, top down bitch I ain't no liar
Henny on the rocks, and plenty on the rocks
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher
Now! Maine on fire, e'ry week can see my name on flyers
Henny by the shots, many bottles poppin
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar

[Verse Two: J. Cole]
BLAOW! We collect a hundred thou
Gettin over on promoters might as well say run it now
I was such a cunnin child 
The one yo' girl mama wish she brought back home instead of you, the one yo' mama glad you hung around
Cole! A charmin nigga that could harm a nigga
Chest out in yo' hood like I walk around with armor nigga
But it's just me and all my niggas and we fuck the baddest
Bitches on the planet witness this is hustle at it's....finest
'Cause while you niggas chase vaginas
We just let the paper blind us while vaginas chase behind us
While, take notes make money don't make jokes
For a master grab his rope and make us all the scapegoats
Real shit, but if the world really 'bout to end
You might as well let my nigga Craigout the pen
Pain so deep the words bled out the pen
And maine don't sleep nigga I win, then come again
HUH!

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Maine on fire, top down bitch I ain't no liar
Henny on the rocks, and plenty on the rocks
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher
Now! Maine on fire, e'ry week can see my name on flyers
Henny by the shots, many bottles poppin
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar

[Outro: J. Cole]
BLAOW!!! Maine on fire, top down bitch I ain't no liar
Henny on the rocks, and plenty on the rocks
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher
Now! Maine on fire, e'ry week can see my name on flyers
Henny by the shots, many bottles poppin
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar
BLAOW!!!
