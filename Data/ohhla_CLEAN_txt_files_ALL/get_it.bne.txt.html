[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
We can get it onnnnnnnnn {*4X*}

[Layzie Bone]
Throw them hands up, nigga guard your grill, put the gun down, nigga keep it real
See the truth of the matter you a pussy dawg like a coward nigga you ready to kill
Still the fact remains, you ain't got no heart, you ain't got no brain
Buster nigga you lame, one murder to get a name
And I go to war for two thangs, my family and my paper
My money moves they stay major nigga you cross the line and I'll fade ya
If you want it, you can get it and that's on everything that I love
From the clip up from the shoulders I'll bring it to any one of you thugs nigga
You seen the Bone... let me spell it out
S-U-double-C-E-S-S, nigga flat out
And I done had about enough drama, enough pain, too much strife
Take this shit to the middle of the streets nigga, if you wan' fight
When it's time to go nigga that's it, like +Trainin Day+, nigga man up
Go 'head nigga stand up, put them hands up and let 'em fly
Y'all niggaz is scared as shit, I dare you bitch go make a move
Any one of y'all got shit to prove, bet it all Lil' Lay don't lose

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Been in a good fight, street wars and bar room brawls
And the arguments with the family but we family y'all
Get it back together as we laugh it off, baby it means so much
How could we ever ever stay out of touch?
So many tears that the children were to appear as they there
And I'm tryin to provide our kids, steadily on the grind but I'm sad
As the life roll, I need a humble abode
They think about it so warm cause the world's so cold
I gotta provide, stay ridin, tear slowly
Gotta get up by myself and pray to the Lord so lonely
Missin my Bone Thug homies, Makaveli and Pun
Left-Eye, Aaliyah, Biggie Smalls, yes we represent the one (one)
Long life prosperity, a huge fuckin family
My granny Philomina and she care for me
Time we get it together so we can shine so bright
Praise God in the darkness, yeah the light

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
Nigga we gon' ride, 'til the wheels fall off with calico's and real sawed-offs
I'ma bust a nigga in the dome, there'll be bodybags they will haul off
In the trenches since my brother's sentence; henchmen, on a fuckin mission
Money, and the power is what I'm after nigga so pay attention
And if I catch a nigga slippin dawg, I'm takin all his property
Don't make me have to pop the heat, nigga, what you got for me?
If I were down I wouldn't say a word nigga I'm the man, what you ain't heard?
Talk that shit and you will get served, word is bond, nigga this my word

[Chorus]</pre>
