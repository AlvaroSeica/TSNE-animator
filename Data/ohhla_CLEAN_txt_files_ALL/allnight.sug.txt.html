I come from Freaktown baby
I come from Freaktown, hit it!
Kev touch his self, to prove that he's a freak
I can't hold it back, the paint flowin over
Can't hold it back I am the future
Touch it why don'tcha, touch it why don'tcha
Touch it why don'tcha, touch it why don'tcha
Hey girl, oooh girl!  Hey girl, I wanna rock your world

	Are you talkin to me?
Hey girl, would meet me at the waterbed tonight?
I got a surprise for you
I wanna give it to you

	*chorus*
All... (all) night... (he's called) long... (Daddy Long)
New, York, City, wanna give it to you
All... (all) night... (he's called) long... (Daddy Long)
Watashi-wa, Tokyo suki

I'm the Waterbed Kev and I'm here to say
Bout what's goin on in the USA
How the President's givin all kind of advices
But that don't stop the raisin in the prices
Candidates cuts each other's throat
Just to get poor people out there to vote
If you look in the sky, at the stars above
You read Waterbed Kev, he was made for love

Ladies, all night long
They wait for Kev, to come on home
And run to the roof, to shoot the juice
It's me that they love, they love me
You know that I can feel you comin
Yes my waterbed is runnin
All that I say
Is that it's time for you to lay, in my waterbed

	*chorus*

Helloooo, ladies
What's your name, your number girlll
I would like to get to know you
I'm Waterbed -- Kev touch his self, to prove that he's a freak

Some people go through rap, wit no style of their own
Being someone else instead, of being who they are, just like
She's like her, and he's like him, oh what a shame
Cause when you hear one rapper you hear the same
They sellin to mutual gain, to the ladies

Ladies, all night long
They wait for Kev, to come on home
And run to the roof, to shoot the juice
It's me that they love, they love me
I'm back, on your top, girls are waiting
Sometimes we go roller skating
They hurry up and come
Cause we can't wait, to get it on

And then it's what did Water say (GO!)
Now screammmm (YAHHH!)
How that sound (GRREAT!)

If you a freak, repeat freak what did water say (GO!)
Now screammmm (YAHHH!)
How that sound (GRREAT!)
[repeat 3X]

Watashi-wa, Tokyo suki
He's a freak, so touch your arm
She's a freak, so touch your leg (yeah girl)
He's alright (see) and she's alright (see)
And they alright (they) and Kev's alright (me!)

Hello ladies (hey baby what's happenin)
What's your name and your number girl (how you doin tonight darlin)
(check it out I have these two tickets to this fantastic show)
I would like, to get to know you
(I got a pocket full of money, let's get together and do the wild thing)
I'm Waterbed (it's gonna be fine, c'mon, c'mon)
 -- Kev touch his self to prove that he's a freak

I can't hold it back, the paint flowin over
I can't hold it back I am the future
Touch it why don'tcha, touch it why don'tcha
Touch it why don'tcha, touch it why don'tcha!

Kev touch his self to prove that he's a freak, hit it!
Hey girl, would you meet me at the waterbed later on
Say about, 11 o'clock, and we can do it all night long firl
	10:30 sharp

You see my skill and occupation is rappin on the mic
The reason that I do it is that's what I like
Got the capabilities to do other thing
Bein a movie star, sportin diamond rings
Be a player, a hustler or executive
with a forty-room mansion, that's how I live
Eat the finest food, drink exclusive wine
Search for a girl to be mine all mine
Not lookin for a woman that's only sexy
Listen if I tell ya how ya have to be
Just honest, intelligent with sex appeal
Not lyin baby doll cause that's the real deal
You fit that description, you can't resist
After the party is over, sign up on my list
it's at the door, I wanna see the girls galore
Yes it's the girls, that I do adore

Since I took this time out, to tell you and yours
That I was the Waterbed Kev
And I get the stuff all night long
I just wanted to ask the girls -- how ya like me now?
(We love you Waterbed!)
I said young ladies, how ya like me now?
(We love you Kevie Kev!)
Beins that I'm leavin...

Goodbye, ladies! (Goodbye Kevie Kev)
It was nice, gettin to know you girls (the pleasure was all mine)
I'll be back, shortly (is that a promise?)
You rock, my waterbed (he'll rock your waterbed)
Oh girl, you rocked my waterbed (his name is Kevie Kev)

Whassup Juice!
	What it be like Kevie Kev
	I'm just maxin and relaxin gettin ready to do the wild thing
	What's happenin for tonight?
Yo I'ma tell you I just DID the wild thing
Man I was in the waterbed, matter of fact, c'mon man let's..
Can we go talk about..
