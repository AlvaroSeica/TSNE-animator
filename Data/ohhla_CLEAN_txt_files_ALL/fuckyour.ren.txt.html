[Intro: Crazy Toones Talking]
Okey, Okey, that's what I'm sayin'
there's no compromisin' with bitch-Ass-Niggaz
aiy, aiy baby that's ain't your nigga, he's a bitch
yeah, I like to hit the shit, in you or that nigga
aww, that nigga see me piss in his panties

[Verse 1: Mitchy Slick]
nigga I can't believe you, but now hustlin'
and comin' roam with the dough and handin' it over to this butt
my pig, you picked him, cause he got Rims and TV's "what"
but he's a bitch, when the nigga seize me, he'll speak peace
couldn't be a gangster into the streets beside peice
and there go, you can thought outta the P.I.M.P "you don't know"
sounds like a sucker or a buster that tell me
he gotta do somethin', he needs an Identity
to get bitches he needs a Gimmick, so he'll do what he got to
seen America pimp a few times now he is out poppin' his collar
these freak barricaded ass-niggaz make wanna holla
now all the fly world grew up on the out skirts
saw the heats, saw they born known him since the birth
great, but she ain't never knew me
could have her to them niggaz but she scare of the OG's.....

[Chorus: MC-Ren]
Fuck that Ice on your wrist, fuck your Fine-Ass-Bitch..
Fuck that Ice on your wrist, fuck your Fine-Ass-Bitch..
Fuck that Ice on your wrist, fuck your Fine-Ass-Bitch..
when you bumpin' to a gangster, gangster
how is it, that you don't know you're givin' you money to a hoe cake
you can't be fly with a guy like that, ugh
you can't be fly with a guy like that, no

[Verse 2: Mitchy Slick]
now girl you miss him out, cause every bitch you get
what I said, got fake bitches and D.N.G on our blocks
and you must be square as fuck
not be able to tell that your spouse is a mouse
never did nothin' to know once when you always hang out "buster"
never walks to bum and what a shame now "mark"
on the out Skirts with his clique, he got a couple of rounds
with some real niggaz, then he'll be knock the fuck out
girl what's gonna happen, when you bumpin' to a gangster
from the dipped in wants to break you
all cause he knows you niggaz are homo
got pretty twin glass never shot them before
keep focus, you for shees, and be turn off ease
and you think, you need to stay away from niggaz like me
girl you hustle and then reverse
I can show you how to maximize your network...

[Chorus: MC-Ren]
Fuck that Ice on your wrist, fuck your Fine-Ass-Bitch..
Fuck that Ice on your wrist, fuck your Fine-Ass-Bitch..
Fuck that Ice on your wrist, fuck your Fine-Ass-Bitch..
when you bumpin' to a gangster, gangster
how is it, that you don't know you're givin' you money to a hoe cake
you can't be fly with a guy like that, ugh
you can't be fly with a guy like that, no

[Verse 3: Crazy Toones]
you was a player shit, what nigga, you was a bitch "faggot"
how you from there go and not a blood or a crib (*Gun Cocked*) "aww shit"
and I better not hear no funny shit
when I hit you up about, knockin' you for a honey dip
unless you want the flesh on your chest
clacked into a mess for less
then run into your mouth like a bitch when you see me in the S
matter fact nigga get your.. come on nigga.. give me that
you might get trick, little mamma with the blacks and tacks
but we know it if your ass get jacked, you're a rat
only act bunny when he's got this nigga behind him
but wait till them wrong kind nigga find him
creep behind him and leave him for the squash till I wind hin
my crimes is all gang affiliated
at night we on TV I know you really hate it
and when you bitch see me now she is really faded..

[Chorus: MC-Ren]
Fuck that Ice on your wrist, fuck your Fine-Ass-Bitch..
Fuck that Ice on your wrist, fuck your Fine-Ass-Bitch..
Fuck that Ice on your wrist, fuck your Fine-Ass-Bitch..
when you bumpin' to a gangster, gangster
how is it, that you don't know you're givin' you money to a hoe cake
you can't be fly with a guy like that, ugh
you can't be fly with a guy like that, no

[Outro: Mitchy Slick]
how is it, that you don't know you're givin' you money to a hoe cake
you can't be fly with a guy like that, ugh
you can't be fly with a guy like that, no
how is it, that you don't know you're givin' you money to a hoe cake
you can't be fly with a guy like that, ugh

Okey, Okey (*Echoes*)</pre>
