[Large Professor]
Now I've never been one to knock the next man for getting his
You know what I'm saying? (Right, right)
And I do realize that now hip-hop is a form of showbiz  (Uh huh)
But this has always been something with which you have to be true
So in the year on 1992...(this is how we do!)

[Large Professor]
At the age of 19, heard the scene
A lot of M.C.'s that do not come clean
Fronting on dealing hard times in rhymes
You see him in the streets and you see no signs
Of the hell, and they get on stage and tell
Some cornball war story, ring the bell (word)
You're fakin the funk
Talking that extra hard junk, you're probably a punk
And Imma let you know, that this way
You just don't cut with the artificial flow

[Neek the Exotic]
Neek the Exotic breaks backs and necks
When fakes try to front, they get smoked like blunts
My rhymes penetrate like skunk
Ayo word up, I think you're fakin' the funk

[Large Professor]
You're fakin the funk! (You're fakin the funk)

Chorus:
Yo! You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin the funk)  (Repeat 6x)

[Large Professor]
You do a song about a current event
Get on television and seem hesitant to represent
And that's what we call fraud
You can't kick the streets with a look I sold out a board (word)
And everywhere has streets
That's not trying to hear the same wack rhymes
Over the same stink beats
Cause times are real, and I can't feel
Putting...down on the reel to reel

[Neek the Exotic]
Now I'm a let you know
With those weak style of raps, it's time to go
I eject rejects that step
I'm a vet ready to snap your neck
I shine and rhyme at the same time
The mastermind of the sport called the rhyme
Now it's my time to dump chumps that front
(Ayo Professor what's up?)

[Large Professor]
You're fakin' the funk

Chorus (1/2)

[Large Professor]
The era of the wack M.C.
Is getting shut down when the Main Source stomps through your town
Cause we don't play the role of a clown
And keep things jumping with the real rap sound

So to all the people stealing beats           (You're fakin the funk)
To the crossover rapper with the pleats       (You're fakin the funk)
To all the chumps that's claiming the streets (You're fakin the funk)
Fronting incredible feats                     (You're fakin the funk)
To the girl acting like a prostitute          (You're fakin the funk)
Wearing that hooker type suit                 (You're fakin the funk)
To the rapper with the big space suit         (You're fakin the funk)
To the artist that doesn't pay dues           (You're fakin the funk)

[Neek the Exotic]
Cause, exotic and then you're torn with the hyper tone
I can't be blown because my rhymes are hard like stone
So prepare for the scare, because I'm you're worst nightmare, punk
Cause you're fakin the...

Chorus
