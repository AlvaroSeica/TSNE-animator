[Bridge #1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
You and your folks love me and my folks
Me and my folks love you and your folks
Never was poor, that ever ever was poor

[Verse 1]
It seems a nigga can't get a job but he can get arrested
Thought shit was changing which this black president shit
My bitch got me fucked up, going to get tested
Cause while I was locked up, she was living reckless
Just another ordeal a real nigga got a deal with
If you on the bottom right now, you got to feel this
I know that you're frustrated and you want to kill shit
Stockpile your weapons cause that day just might come real quick

[Bridge #2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Burn)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (this mother-)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (fucker)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (down)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (I will burn)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (this mother-)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (fucker)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (down)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
They say the cop wrote a letter apologizing to Oscar
Guess they say I'm wrong cause I still say drop him
Police in the ghetto, they is killing niggas daily
But when we get to busting back they'll say that we crazy
Prisons overcrowded and school is too
Cause they under educate you and got a place for you, yeah
Niggas go to prison, new age slavery
Now you knowing why they under educate your baby

[Bridge #2]
[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
They say get a job, you can think and grow rich
But what are you to do when the dollar ain't worth shit?
And the jobs ain't hiring, unemployment is gone
They going to repo your car and foreclose your home
Me I suggest you get yourself a shotgun
So when they come to evict you can make them run
The banks got bailed out but we still suffering
So I got a gun cause I've done had enough of them

[Bridge #2]
[Hook x2]

[Verse 4]
They say love Jesus and listen to your pastor
But Jesus told the truth and the pastor's a lying bastard
All he talk about is economic elevation
And all Jesus talked about soul salvation
Jesus sat with the sick and he walked with the poor
If he gave blood for our sins why we giving more?
I got some gangster disciples at church with me tonight
With five dollars worth of gas and a matchbook to light
