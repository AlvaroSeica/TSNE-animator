Song:   Crazy In Love
Typed by: iamomni dot com

shes crazy in love with a married man
with a wedding band on his hand
but she say she understands and she's willing to budge
he's everything a woman could want the house with the car in the front
and the pool in the back he always spends his money on her
he says she never has to worry about anything he takes care of the rent
he said she makes him feel young she knows what to do with tongue
he said she was the one and he can have whatever he wants he gets bored every
few months then hes on to the next not easily impressed he only likes to fuck
with the best but its just for the sex he likes to hang with the stars
drive luxury cars and get lots of respect hes on top of the world
a gentlemen thats into her yeah she's crazy in love.

yeah yeah yeah yeah shes crazy in love

she's crazy in love the look in her eye gave me a buzz
when he walked up and gave her a hug on the way to the club
she's looking like she's ready to uh she took another shot of the uh
and made her way to the rug she said this is her favorite song
tonight she wants to dance alone she like the feel of the drums
with x on the tip of her tongue shes sexing him and getting him sprung
shes 'bout as real as they come and she can have whatever she wants
she pays for everything she flaunts she says she wants the best in the
world she wants keys to the safe enough doe will get you a date
a lifestyle she couldnt escape she stuck a gun in his face
and yelled rape all the way to the bank I got it all on videotape
shes crazy in love

[Chorus]</pre>
