[Intro: Popa Chief]
Yo, it's Popa Chief (one-two, one-two)
I does it different than everybody else (one-two)
If I start doing it like them
What's gonna keep me from being them?

[Popa Chief]
I break bread and duplicate, game tight as a turban get
If it's dope, I'm looping it, if it's sticky, I'm burning it
Never been the property of the state, allergic to courtdates
And big hairy cellmates, my roots is gon' stay nappy, you can call me Pops
Or Papi, what I got in a brown paper bag, keep a brother happy
All I need is a dame, with hellafy back of the neck game
Cuz my mean old lion is dying to be tamed
Pound out some back shots, then ask your name
Mine don't be asking for no change, please refrain
I got three seeds, and they need some things
So we gon' split this order of chicken wings
Value Menu, late night drive-through window, we going dutch
Yours come to 6.52, what?
If your girl don't like it, she can get the hell out, too
The brain was lovely, god bless you

[Chorus: Popa Chief]
All I got is hardwood and bubble gum
Hop in, girl, if you wanting some
I forgot to tell you I'm fresh out of gum
So, let's ride if you wanting some
Yo, all I got is hardwood and bubble gum
Hop in, girl, if you wanting some
I forgot to tell you I'm fresh out of gum
So, what's it's gonna be? Come on

[Outro: Popa Chief]
Let's ride, let's roll, come on, yeah
Let's ride, let's roll, fix ya hair
Let's ride, let's roll, come on, yeah
Come on, girl, get on up in here, yeah</pre>
