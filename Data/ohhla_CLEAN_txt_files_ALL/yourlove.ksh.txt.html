[Ke$ha]
Maybe I need some rehab, or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession, I'm seein it in my dreams
I'm lookin down every alley, I'm makin those desperate calls
I'm stayin up all night hopin hittin my head against the wall
What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it, all the time
I'm all strung out my, heart is fried
I just can't get you, off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love - is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love - is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Ke$ha]
Won't listen to any advice, momma's tellin me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices, I'm addicted it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy, my judgment's gettin kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected, if I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead
What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Ke$ha]
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave
Hey~! So I gotta question; do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love with your drug? Your drug... want your drug
Want your drug...  is my love, your drug?

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro]
Hey, heyyy! {*giggling*}
So... {*laughing loudly*}
Your love, your love, your love, your love
{*whispering*} is my drug
I like your beard</pre>
