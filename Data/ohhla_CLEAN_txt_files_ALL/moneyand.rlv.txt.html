[Larry-O]
The K made the brotherly hit I be enhancing
The predator editor wigsplita like Manson
Who wanna see if they can bang with me?
Ya'll people ain't got enough D-O-E
As sure as a thousand grams equals a key
I be the all metro from the E-A-S-T
You got a pistol and scared to pull
Your zig-zagging I'm hittin with a barrage of bullets
My technique freaks when I speak
I do phenomenal feats with astronomical beats
I'm certified insane
My vocab will stab any rapper in the brain
(Hey player what you workin with?)
I got four broads they all wanna get hit
Plus a fifth of Remy a quarter pound of good shit
We off the K's crib time to split

[Larry-O]
I got a shorty in my scope I'm brown like dope
Coming back like good coke I smoke til I choke
The pimp with the walk and the talk
Cartel from New Jers well connected in New York
Freaks I like to fool em punks I like to tool em
Before I roll my dice you know a player gotta school em
Streetwise dramatical lyrically mathematical
I'm mentally equipped I'm in a cage combatical
When I stack cream chickens attract like magnets
Plus brothers be open and only hit by fragments
Of platinum shrapnel I consume the whole room
A coliseum I'm turning the joints into my museum
Your more mad cos I rated well planned
It's the rap scene was puzzled cos I hit em full blast
I got a concept that everybody know
Its all about the money and shows so here we go

[Larry-O]
I've been official from day 1 I'm stacking my bank son
I make the joints for the killers that spray guns
And all the shorties running game acting naughty
Taking rookies for their stock in every city and every block
The stage is set for me to rock
Quick sound check the street sweepers on cock
Crabs like to test the stretch
I got the pearl handled .45 and camouflage vest
Stop, think cop a cold drink
Kick it with a freak but do your dirt on the sneak
Why?  Groupies like to tell mad lies
Loot is on your mind and I can see it in your eye
You ain't said nothing slick yo
You used to play the dime roll now your sweating KNO
Cos a player got bagged an shit
Ripping up shit and we refuse to quit</pre>
