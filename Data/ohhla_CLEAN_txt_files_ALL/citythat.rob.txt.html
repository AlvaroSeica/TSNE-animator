(Lil' Rob)
I'm from the city that everyone knows
All clean creased up on my clothes
Hit the street and hop the low low
Even got hydraulics on the Limo

I'm from the city that everyone knows
All clean creased up on my clothes
Hit the street and hop the low low
Got my baby waiting in the limo

(Lil' Rob)
It's all real to me homes don't need to make shit up
I don't kick it with you vatos cause you fake the funk
You never once had my back your just some fucking punks
Why sit and why ask and wonder who to trust
When the answer's so obvious
It's no one it's no fun
Putos talking shit and they just go on and go on and so on
I'm giving you something to go on
I got myself an Oldie CD I want to throw one
Mix it with some hip-hop making sure its tip top
Shape for your rafla bumping like you want to
Add some Mexican rap to your collection
Imagine hoppin your ride
Bumpin this in an intersection
Interesting ain't that what us Mexicans do?
We can put it down too it's 2002
I guarantee you'll see me in 2003
In a 2004, fucking slammed on the floor

(Chorus)

(Lil' Rob)
It's time I pick up the pieces, get sick like diseases
Don't you understand I don't want to be like he is
I mean it, I can only call it how I see it
See it then I call it, drink like Alcoholics
Only drop the bomb shit, only smoking chronic
Let me make a phone call if I don't already got it
Now watch this, Wacha I'm on the deadline
What can we give this fucking guy so he can write some rhymes
A bag of yerba, six pack of cerveza
But most important of all homes it's the feria
I need some kind of motivation dog
It's not enough just having people hating Lil' Rob
I'm here to... Open your eyes and make you all see
Chicano rap is also rap so why are they labeling me
Hating on me I deserve some fucking radio play
Any time of the day not just once a week one time on Sunday (you know)

(Chorus)

(Lil' Rob)
Pull out some lyrics I had folded in my pocket
Hold it up in front of the mic then I rock it, can't stop it
Every car I own I have to drop it
Fix it up, switch it up that way I can lift it up over speed bumps
I need bumps, bumping out some oldies
Cruise around go and place some horseshoes with the homies
Have a couple cheves, chillin by my Chevy
Gonna grab another beer is anybody ready
I don't got a bottle opner, I gotta use my lighter
Always got a lighter cause I always use the fire
To light the le√±o, I got a, bicentennial
Order up some home grown, shit gets me stoned homes
Go a little loco, feelin like a tonto
That's when you know that it's almost time to go home
And get ready for the night time
Cause Ray Charles said it best, night time is the right time

(Chorus)</pre>
