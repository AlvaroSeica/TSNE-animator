[Akil]
Yea

[Soup]
Turn me up though

[Akil]
Uh Huh,Yea

[Soup]
Come on

[Akil]
Anyway

[Soup]
A 1,2 what cha gonna do
2,3 what's this gonna be... come on now

Akil and Soup (talking over each other)
Yea Yea uh, a come on now
Let me hear you, Let me hear you

[Akil]
Uh yea
Provoke emotions when I'm boastin and braggin
Just imagine gun clappin' linguistic assassin
Bout to shake the world up, slam it to the floor up
You heard of us, real niggaz we blow the world up
Rip off the planet, take it for granted when I manage
With that home team advantage, automatic rhyme bandit
Bout to hand it , Cause you cram to understand it
When I land it open handed
I'm a transatlantic slave, with that old black magic
Got to have it from the demo, to the master
Some brothers try to strike, but light the fire of disaster
I'm the chainsaw massacre, brain ball acid dust
Down shift, pump your brakes, ease off the clutch
We fuck it up, when we conduct, load your pistol up
Put this verbal dick in your mouth, until I bust a nut
And let this jam tell you who the fuck I am
Original black man from the Billali Sudan

[Chorus: Akil and Soup]
It's like that y'all, so go head and get up
Sample (Be bad)
This is the future sound
(Sample)
Without further ado, you don't see us, but we see you

[Akil]
Either you're here to teach

[Both]
Or you're here to be taught

[Akil]
If you don't plan to get away

[Both]
Then you plan to get caught
I was born to lead, that why I run don't walk
South-central MC what the fuck you thought

[Soup]
I set my first verse up, similar to a stake out
The minute that they break out, they send jake out
But I'm super laxative and I don't need no practice kid
You're probably wondering what track this it

[Akil]
Uh, so carry on with that twisted ass street rap
I ride for peace, but I will contradict that
And bitch slap any rapper that act, uh
Like he really want it I'm a have to mishap

[Soup]
So act like you want it, but don't get loud
And you haven't seen a style this vivid in awhile

[Akil]
I rebuild cause I'm a rebel
My education and rhythm is on a higher level
Smash til the dust settles

[Chorus]

Yes, yes, yes y'all
Mic test, test y'all
Freestyle lyrics being thrown straight at y'all
And we hype so and we might just flow from the get go
Hey yo Soup, let 'em know

[Soup]
I'm one of the last cats, (That's right) puttin' the flavor back in the rap
And make a sun roof straight to your cap
Now the original black, now watch how the herbs react
I play the block, where I learned to rap (tell em)
Ain't nothing to it, I keep the word play fluent
And tone will run through like the emperor Jones
Now the inventor of poems and lymrics outstanding pitch
Regardless if your feeling my shit
Yo, I stay prime and plus I'm never outdated
In time I break atoms from the way that I rhyme
Now I created a line with no miscues, fake no moves
So here's the rhyme I couldn't wait to use
I represent, and put the pressure on your local event
And drop heavy when the vocal commits
To hit you with the hits, from the colonial prince
The master of the ceremonial
It's like that y'all

[Chorus]</pre>
