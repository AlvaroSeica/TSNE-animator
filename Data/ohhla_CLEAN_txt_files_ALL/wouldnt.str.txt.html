I should be standing at the bar, waving a ten pound note around
But I sit here on the sofa at my girl's house
I should be chatting shit as I'm nubbing out another snout
But I'll roach a spliff watching the TV for now
I should be watching the fruit machines, for which one will pay out
But I sit on the sofa at my girls, anyhow
I should be legging it from a cab, like a mad little lout
But I'll roach a spliff watching the TV, throughout

[Chorus]
I know I never tell her, but every single day, man
I'm always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me, and
I don't know what I'd do without her

I should actually go out and about, flip some beer mats
Instead of sitting her at my girl's gaff
'Cause, all I seem to do is sit in this habitat
Just roaching a spliff, watching the TV and that
And the TV at my house is a bit broken on the back
So I use my girl's TV to watch the match
Yeah, I, might head out later to get off this beaten track
Of, watching the TV, roaching up, I'm the same old man

[Chorus]

But on second thought, so why don't you shots
No, I, think, I, will, sit on the sofa
And eat my TV meal
I would actually much prefer to just sit here and chill
Roaching a spliff, watching East-Enders or the Bill
'Cause basically I love her, and I love being here still
And I love sitting on the sofa with my girl, for real
I don't want to knock my mates
But there it's the same old drill
Roaching a spliff, watching the TV is my will

[Chorus]

No fuck that
I might ask my mates where they'll be drinking
From the sofa giving them a ding
Tell 'em, I will go freeze on that ground later on this evening
Instead of roaching a spliff, watching the TV again
And then go out
Whilst back at her's, she does her ting
Sitting on the sofa at her end
But, as I watch the big screen I know I will quite miss
Me and her roaching a spliff, watching the TV again

I know I never tell her, but every single day, man
 I'm always thinking loads about her
(That's exactly what I'm talking about)
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
(I wouldn't have it any other way)
And I don't know what I'd do without her
(I'll tell you this)
I know I never tell her
(There's a whole world out there)
but every single day, man
(A whole world)
I'm always thinking loads about her
(But do I give her?)
She's the best thing that ever happened to me
(Do you know what I mean?)
And I don't know what I'd do without her
(There's a whole world out there)
