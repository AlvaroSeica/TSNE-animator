Song:   Calm Yourself
Typed by: iamomni dot com

[Omni]
you're so comforting
you make me wanna sing myself to sleep
come inside and sing me a lullaby

[Chorus]
singer:
calm yourself
all is well
don't you dwell
time will tell
don't you give up on me now
don't turn your back on me now
calm yourself
all is well
don't you dwell
time will tell
don't you give up on me now
don't turn your back on me now

[Omni]
I bring the best out the situation
I can be on the beat yelling we can make it
some problems don't come until we create them
some problems don't go away until you face 'em
I don't chase 'em
god child
rep supreme purpose
murderers that burn churches
what we learn hurt us
rebel forces
the power of a hundred horses
time never sleeps
this is life without a chorus (or course?)
they ain't fightin' for us
sattle up and light your torches
it's the only way to make it out the forrest
spells, war bells
I hit him and his sword fell
chess champ
known to get it crackin more than orvelle
time travels
hand and mind battles with sandcastles
pioneers punch holes in your ??? gear
we ain't dyin' here
we don't live in fear
and I don't wanna lose that feelin'

[Chorus]

[other rapper]
???
with another cup of wine
drunk rhyme
procrastinate till is past supper time
???
yessum
I stress 'em
more snakes and latters in the upper thighs
??? cross dressers
hot pepper
stuff it under the rug
I'm calm enough
bluff with three eighths a ??? tucked up my cuff
scour the face that could make eight cubs
bet that mums stuck her lunch ???? the late part of the month
her valleys growlings pathetic
but now i've let it get that fowl by the neck
it's a hot pound eleven
dripping ink with a scripping message
spot the missing link of this epidemic
I'm tripping on septic
drowning loads of tangled ankle coke
you said it
you have to learn how to calm yourself
don't arm your belt with napalm tempers
take charge
incinerate harm to be past tempers

[Chorus]

other rapper:
you've come so far
that half the yards
you can't give up

[Omni]
be who you are
live your life
ar ah ha ha
people from all parts say you're doing your job and uh
believe it all now when you're playin' your part
and making your mark in the dark
the light is your heart to us
the light is your heart to us
the light is your heart to us
the light is your heart to us
the light is your heart to us
the light is your heart to us
the light is your heart to us
the light is your heart to us...</pre>
