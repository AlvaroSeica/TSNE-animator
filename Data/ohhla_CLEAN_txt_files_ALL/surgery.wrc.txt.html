Seven dayz a week, he's on call
To get the party people up off the wall

Two turntables, speakers, and a mixer
He'll rock your party wherever you be.

[Dr. Dre]
I'm Dr. Dre gorgeous hunk of a man
Doing tricks on the mix like no others can
The nurses say I'm cute, they say i'm fine
but you betta beware cuz' i'll blow your mind
I'll take you to my car I'll take you to my home
ans up and down your body my finger will roam
The nurses say that I'm nasty they say that I'm mean
But when you come to my pad your guaranteed to scream
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</pre>
