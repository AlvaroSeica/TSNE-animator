"Half-A-Mil" (Interlude)
AZ:
Ha, ha, ha, new drink, Balley's and Henny
you ain't got no Henny, get the Remy
you ain't got the Remy, any cognac'll do. . .
Smooth criminal shit baby. . . 

Half-A-Mil:
Kaiser Sosa intention
Glide in a Hummer wit the flyin' saucer engine
Willied out, at my crib in the winter having cookouts
Smack by witch, look out
I'm like Barnabas, crab niggas tryin' to conquer us
They mad cuz we jump outta cabs, and hop on the bus
Copin' dust, Firm Clique rock the whole Metropolis
Bitches who burn dick won't put a stop to us
Niggas who. . . . . .

{fades directly into "Love Is Love"}

"Love Is Love"

AZ:
See...this is what I mean...when we come together like this
incredible things take place...
see we connect thoughts to collect shorts,
and only the strong survive...
I love my black people...we are the future...

{Nina Simone sample:
"Black is the color of my true love's hair,
his face so soft &amp; wondrous cared"}

AZ {Verse One}
Chop the pie up, four ways, get lyed up
Infiltrate, never violate get tied up
It's all a chess game, choose sides, the best remains
True lies, vibes die when bums infest the game
Bogus shit shots, you woke but let your man get locked
I love this hip-hop, stock the bank let the Crist pop
Peep the next shit, push a big Benz, fuck a Lexus
The streets was hectic, so I stacked and made my exit
More doe to get, focus my thoughts for me to go legit
Ferosious shit, cop a huge castle, on the ocean cliff
Imagine that, a few years back, I was baggin' cracks
Magnum gats, playin' street corners, commitin' savage acts
Twistin' up, nuttin' but love, for niggas sittin' up
Hold your own, try comin' home wit out gettin' touched
Two for one, laws made foul how they do the young
Whose new to come, tried to tell shorty he shoulda threw the gun

{Nina Simone sample: "Black is the color of my true love's hair,
of my true love's hair."}

Half-A-Mil {Verse Two}
Knowledge the green Wallies, all I see
Mama hold math like caller I.D.
Chose the path that chose me
I'ma tell you like G-o-d told me
Greed, lust, hate, and envy sweeped us from Shemtie
Keep us from simply, unifyin', organizin'
We all are fallin', when we think we all are risin'
We pop Crist on the horizon, topless chicks wit thick thighs &amp;
I'd rather be civilizin', enterprisin', improvisin'
Temperature risin', L.O. Heem gave me the guidance
Told me leave those 85ers alone, blend wit the wise men
That buy 80 G stones, twin Mercedes at homes
Fuck a juck, spend 10 Gs alone on chrome
When I die they'll take my chromosomes and clone clones
Two hundred and eight bones
Microchip kits, we most dominant
You know what time it is, that's why I exist
Jump out of limo, lims, fire the blitz, wise scientist
Applyin' this, ?lavi," then wide this
I'm survivin' this, quiet tribalness, finalist
Year 2000, flyin' the whips
9 cent, mind bent, 1999 rhyme alignment

{Nina Simone sample: "Blaaaaaaaaaaack is the colorrrrrrrrrr"}

Nature {Verse Three}
We went from, arraignments to entertainment
24 seve, the same shit, playin' the strip livin' dangerous
Bottle after bottle, soon became a ritual
The patterens we follow, others found 'em difficult
I guess it's obvious
As to what my hobby is
The root of all evil, pollute the scene niggas by the kids
Gettin' caught up, the same game done left 'em all stuck
I reminisce on V.S. touchin' my fourth cup
Me?  My only problem is I'm more fucked
Knowin' in my heart I can't sleep, till I bust off nuts
Weed religion, for all my niggas that beat the system
And those bentin', sittin' since Conico Vision
Y'all need to listen, it's journalistic
Y'all hear the whispers "Niggas in The Firm is twisted."
Spit that fly shit that earn the bitches
Whip the chrome six up the F.D.R.
It's blessed we are 
See I never let 'em strees me god, forever stress free
While twistin' up logs of that Nestle
Who are you to question me?  It's just my destiny
To kick back, kill time, and live successfully

{Nina Simone sample:  "When he and I will be as one."} 

AZ:  {Nina Simone sample playing through out}
Firm... How y'all want it? Huh? hu... Talk to me... We give it to ya 
either way... We workin' wit ch'all... This, is for you...Love Is 
Love... 9-8.... Firm shit....

{Nina Simone sample: "Black is the colorrrrr... of my true love's 
hair... my true love's hair... of my truuuuuuuuuue love's hair."}</pre>
