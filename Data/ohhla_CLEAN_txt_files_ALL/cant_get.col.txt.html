[Intro - J. Cole - talking]
(Ahh) Cole World
(Ahh) Southside
Can't get enough, can't get enough (ahh)
Eastside, Westside, worldwide (ahh)
Ride out

[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
Now I ain't got no kids yet but this right here's for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet but that's how good yo ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow yo moves all week on Twitter, probably make a gay nigga reconsider
Ya now rockin with the best mayne, dress game down to the sex game
Won't brag but the boy been blessed mayne, let you play with the stick, Ovechkin
She callin, she textin, she's fallin but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate girl, 'cause a nigga don't play them ex/X Games
Nope, straight sexin, no handcuff or arrestin
And I ain't comin off of my last name, 'cause I really can't take no stressin
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl sayin "he a bad boy"
But I'm signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch put down them tabloids

[Chorus - Trey Songz] (J. Cole) - w/ ad libs
She said "I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
What you got, I need a lot, so I can't let you go"

(She said "I, can't get enough, can't get enough")
[I, need that]
("I, can't get enough, can't get enough")
[I, need that]
("I can't get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go but I just could not
So don't you stop, I need that")

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter, even way out in London town
Hoes holla 'cause they love my sound and I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town, where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that'll cut all night, that'll suck all night, we just cut off lights (off lights)
Almost missed my flight, tryin to get my last little nut, alright?
She be down for whatever, whenever I wanna get up in the guts, alright?
Never fuss or fight, on the grind tryin to find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head, I hate it when you give me headaches

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World baby, ain't nothin sunny
I see 'em hatin but it ain't nothin to me
I'm from the 'ville, where they bang for the money
And carry four-fives like change for a twenty (for a twenty)
So what I look like scared?
Them niggaz over there look like nerds
Never mind that girl, let's make a track
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right there (right there)
That's the hook right there
That's the hook right there
Never mind that girl, let's make a track
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right there

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs</pre>
