[Intro]
I've been waitin all my life for this right here

[Travie McCoy]
If the time is near
Then fine, I've been waitin patiently for years
Fought lines, in my mind
I'm more unstable than I fear

[Chorus One]
And I don't know, just take my hand
It's time to go
So just enjoy your Blue Moon, it'll be over soon
So we might as well have some fun - right?

[Chorus Two]
It's getting critical
Takes a minute for it to settle
I'm unpredictable
And I'm dyin just tryin to feel alive again

[Travie McCoy]
If the time is near
Don't cry, look me in the eyes and dry your tears
Have a seat, right here
While Los Angeles disappears

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two] - 2X

[Tim William]
The clouds surround us, the light leaves us alone
And the sky falls in your hand
Embrace the moment, cause now we're headin home
It couldn't be a sweeter end

[Chorus Two]

[Tim William] + (Travie McCoy)
The clouds surround us, the light leaves us alone (it's getting critical)
And the sky falls in your hand (takes a minute for it set in)
Embrace the moment, cause now we're headin home (I'm unpredictable)
It couldn't be a sweeter end (and I'm dyin just tryin to feel alive again)</pre>
