[Intro]
Yeah! Hahahahahaha...
BRRAP! HEAVY METAL KINGS~!!
Billy Idol, Vinnieapazy

[Vinnie Paz]
It's a burgundy bath, everybody get turned into ash
Bein evil just somethin I made my personal task
The G36 put you in surgery fast
Everybody die regardless who first or who last
Death almost got me twice but he mercifully passed
I'll take your face off without usin surgical masks
I wouldn't call it an ego but I'm certainly gassed
This isn't the Desert Eagle but it certainly smash
If I don't get money from rhymin that's a fateful day
I might have to take it back to the kitchen like Rachel Ray
I don't put no work in with bitches, I'm tryin to scrape today
Anywhere in my environment is not the place to play
If I'm hungry in need of food I'll pull a skully down
I don't fuck with workers I'm gunnin whoever run the town
I got enough clips with me to spit a hundred rounds
I'm the father of Christ and y'all are just the son of clowns
I don't think that y'all can fuck with Vinnie but let's see
I'ma have this fuckin llama lookin like Jet Li
Everybody who is anybody respects me
I'll have you bleedin out your back like it's a jet ski

[Chorus 2X: Ill Bill]
Motherfucker, what's really real, really ill?
Run up on you, hit you with Israeli steel, yo we really will
Through windshields, windpipes, and car seats
You die on the Belt Parkway next to Canarsie

[Ill Bill]
Brutal tribes indulge in slavery and human sacrifice
The shooters pack devices capable of provin lack of life
with no compassion, ratchet action, flashy fashion, blast for cash
Assassins faster than the flash, amass a body count, surpass the sound barrier
and shattered by the splatter, rattled you
Wakin shakin sober, gats that kick back and dislocate your shoulder
Decapitate your head and chop you in half, pop you and laugh
Rock you in gas, find you amongst the cowards and fast
Find me holdin the rifle on the watchtower with plans
So never underestimate me or the power of Paz
Lock you in the room with the lion, now how would you last?
You can't fight the king of the jungle, he'll devour you fast
Put you underneath the dirt next to the flowers and grass
At the funeral mommas and dads get showered with gats
You kill one us and we'll kill one of you, counterattack
Thousands of stacks, from hustlin these powders and cracks

[Chorus]

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
I fuckin pick and peel your chain, Official Pistol Gang
From Kill Devil Hills to Pennsylvania we be grippin change
You little pencil brains, before I lose to you
I'll cut my nuts and slit my veins, all y'all do is bitch complain
Henny and pills, plenty of steel
On the block with 50's and krill, word to Vinnie and Bill
In South Philly for real, my hood is guineas and Campbells
Niggaz and dirty Irish who think that they Sam Crow
And oh, my fan know the stream fuck the man yo
No "Book 'em Danno," you ain't Rambo
They'll put, 20 in your hand bone when my fam roam
That's when the grams go, soft white, my niggaz call it that damn snow
And fuck hip-hop, I got sick pot in ziplocks
I get from stoners in Cali, rockin flip flops
One brand is called Sit-Stop cause after one hit
that bitch'll have you "Dancing With the Stars" like Rick Fox

[Chorus]

[Sabac Red]
Yo we have walked back together to gorillas and wolves
The illest of goons, the room is filled with killers and booze
Pretty soon we breakin in your office building with tools
Assassinate the CEO for catchin feelings and moods
The seal of the moon, got us raisin hell on the block
If they manipulate us like a pretty face and smelly twat
Tell me what is power, cash, handguns, and hoorah
A brutal task between thieves, priests, nuns, and Qu'rans
I'm on a path that has the cast, cast bigger and better things
I've been with veteran medicine men headed to Medellin
Brin the noise and avoid the vicious cycle of prison
It's all "Poison," Kool G. Rap, Michael Bivins
Speed of NASCAR, VROOM, Madagascar soon
Consume a rock star whom, Allahu Akhbar boom
Wounded and killed, rumors are real, Israeli steel
Caught your peoples in the grill, now the tomb has been sealed

[Outro]
YO!!!</pre>
