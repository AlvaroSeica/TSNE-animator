Marchitect

Marchitect why you always got the bomb tracks
Because I record in a board with more channels than Comcast
I got at your whore like it's '74 and I'm The Commodores
So let me tell you what I'm rhyming for
Musical lovers that are choosing to bump us
The amps shaking the trunk up until they're loosing their bumpers
I got an arsenal of 45's I keep them in crates
Keep it on the reel to reel you steady keeping it fake
And some of y'all thugs get a standing ovation
Singing like a bird at the police station
Barry Gordy style can't resist the temptation
All choked up like smoke inhalation
So we ain't gonna play it no more like Benny King
Sometimes I feel like y'all be rapping over anything
But it's cool, I probably still got ya CD
Dollar bills tax free so it's nothing to me
To just try it, buy it, take it off the rack
Take out the pack and put that bullshit back
Catch a high on a high flight homie check the eye site
Even when it's cold I compose like a Chi-lite

Hook

Vinyl, cassettes, dats, and CDs
Dub plates even mp3s
It's M-U-S-I-C
And see, that's all that really matters to me
So we, gonna put it on the player and we groove to it
And even all the haters gotta move to it

Jas Mace

We went from wax, to 8-tracks, cassettes, then CDs
But whatever way you put it's just music to me
A lot of people think I'm crazy you should see my collection
It's a wide range of artist even country western
See I'm a producer and respect the game
I don't only buy records for samples that shit's lame
Gotta get in tune with it and make the connection
Even when there's no reception like a marriage with no wedding
Good music is good music I ain't too choosey
It's like hearing BDP for the first
Man, it made me want to loose it
A lot of y'all ain't doing it right and disrespecting the art
Trying to make a quick buck and get your name on the charts
But how the saying go, easy come easy go
While y'all sprinting for the finish I'm in for the long run
I'm trying to make a classic, while you trying to take the cash and dash
you're wack man

Hook

Vinyl, cassettes, dats, and CDs
Dub plates even mp3s
It's M-U-S-I-C
And see, that's all that really matters to me
So we, gonna put it on the player and we groove to it
And even all the haters gotta move to it</pre>
