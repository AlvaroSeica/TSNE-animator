[O.C.]
I say one for the fam, two for good judgment
Bad luck to trife, good luck to stay above it
Trial and error, O.C.'s out to sever
your game respect neglect not
You work hard for the revenue instead of on the avenue, babblin
I'd rather be accomplishin, makin moves, travellin
Insight is right on time let's do it
Funk struck again with the disco fluid
I protrude out of your skin like thorns irritatin MC's
cause they don't make, songs like these
Mister - it's the man most lease to excel
long time ago, many thought I'd fall like a domino, no
Now your face is chump, cause I've summed up
the somethin most high, not a mountain to a bum

[O.C.]
I'm comin with fluent, rhythm, calm yet storm
Unleashin my speech to each and every one
I wake up in the mornin, get up then I'm yawnin
Glad to be alive to another day's dawnin
Some blessed be otherwise, they despise
cause they can't handle what's word from the wise
I don't stress who I measure up to or who's fond of O's
Cause what you build I knock down for my condos
Upon those, those words I speak
More or less my best, just to say the least
Foundation laid, what gives
You ask would I sass regardless, O.C. lives

[O.C.]
One time, it's a check your life record
Yeah peep the method it's a smooth kind of effort
with guidelines to put your hand on your chin and think
Ears listen before you say a record ain't mink
Hard work involves what evolves around O
I try to keep it moderate if that's how I thought of it
I break beats down lashin, with the voice
Choice words I'ma say, only spoken when I'm moist
It's a vibe, coincidin with the rhythm
Choice words to follow, for suckers to swallow
Each one teach - strong not week
So I'ma let mom finish what I started to freak, it's like..
