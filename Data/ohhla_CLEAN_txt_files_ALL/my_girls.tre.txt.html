[Verse One]
I just got off of work it's 1:30
I'm kinds hungry and I know my girl lonely
Headed back to my crib it's kinda early
Surprise my girl because I know she waitin
I open the front door
I hear moanin
For real somebody I'm finna kill somebody
Then I get closer I hear graonin
Bust in tha door and see my girl with a chick
That means I know that

[Chorus]
My girl gotta girlfriend
I just found out but it's alright
As long as I could be with her to
My girl gotta girlfriend
It's really not a problem
Cause I'm a make do what it do
Cause havin two chicks is better than no chick
I rather just join in
Keep my girl and keep the other to
My girl gotta girlfriend
It's really not a problem
Cause I'm a make do what it do girl

[Break]
If you so sexy, you so sexy
I wanna see you clap, I wanna see you clap
If you so sexy, you so sexy
