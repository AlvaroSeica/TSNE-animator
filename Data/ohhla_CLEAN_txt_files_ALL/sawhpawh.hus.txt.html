[Hus talking]
Lil Kelis and Lay gotta eat bro
Let's do it, yeh, yo yo yo it's nothin'

[HOOK]
Let's get this motherfuckin' money
I thank Allah that I'm a sharp man
But I live my life in the dark man
And I swear I see life out the barrel when it spark
I'm obsessed with the guns and the life of a mobsta
I feel I can't be touched I simply just to much
I'ma never die I thank Allah for my power
I'm crowned as the king of the world every hour
And every breath I take, every step I take
A Tec I take protect my fate, protect my fate

[Verse 1]
When I was younger I developed the hunger that's how my hustle came
Niggas hated Husalah so I stepped up my murder game
First it was a slug or two for niggas
Now it's fifty shots rippin' through ya roof nigga
Do more than chip ya tooth nigga
Vamos nigga you gone in a black Caddy wid a new suit on
I'm dope I flow sick my mind is insane
The hoes they gon' shook the choppah's gon' buck but I
Live in the streets like bums do for the respect
On my block niggas come through and rush duke
Twenty-four seven on my spot niggas gunnin'
The Husalah livin' his life never respectin' you suckas
I'll be a hustler to my death
Every fuckin' breath that I take every step that I take
It be a Tec that I take not necessarily a Tec
but a chop wid fifty shots that rip through ya chest

[HOOK]

[Verse 2]
Another verse that I never wrote
Lord, I hope this chop don't smoke tonight and leave a nigga smoked
Twenty-four on my block niggas movin' coke
Yo my life is changed from niggas movin' coke
When I was just a young nigga yo my life changed
I switched over from that right lane, to that left lane
Same lane the death lane the last breath lane but I got a Tec man
And I pop pop aim wid it hop blocks came wid it
Cops sweatin' but we slang but we stay fitted
Hoes jock how we rock but we stay wid it
That's my hustle mami I'll never love you
Tilt my scale weighin' yales makin' sales wid it
A hundred girlfriends caught up in a whirlwind
Stuck in the game in my backstreet life
My backstreet life, my backsreet life

[BRIDGE]
Good Lord ya shoulda seen him when him cry
Good Lord ya shoulda seen him when him cry
A boat coulda sail inna him eye water
A boat coulda sail inna him eye water

This is the life of a gangsta and hustler
And if you wanna live it then niggas come on and get it
Where there's no such thing as pain
No such thing as tears no such thing as years, (nigga chyeh)
This is the life of a gangsta and hustler
And if you wanna live it then niggas come on and get it
Where there's no such thing as pain
No such thing as tears no such thing as years
