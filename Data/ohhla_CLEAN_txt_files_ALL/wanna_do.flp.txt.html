Big Face entertainment, Sucka Free trick

(David Banner)
I be a soulja the 22 inch blades swangin
I see the chrome on 22 inch rims swanging
comin down chop chop Mississipi cha cha
bout bloody, bloody drops(we bump that screw down here)
gettin hot like a dog, black macs for them bitches
mayne we choose to ball step in the spot then (??)
bitch we buying the mall(nawl really?!)

(Bridge)
What these bitches want now?

(Chorus)
What y'all wanna do, what y'all got to say
we bump that screw down here okay!
how you niggas actin, how you niggas roll

(Lil' Flip)
You like yo music fast, I like my music slow
you cut yo hair off, I let my hair grow
you like to ride Daytons we like to ride Dubs
you bought a barbershop I jus bought a club
you need a engineer I got MJ
you bought a two-way I gotta three-way
you talk about whoa, we talk about maaan
you do a show for $1200 we get $20 grand
you wear Timbalands I wear Air Force Ones
you pack 9-millemeters we back automatic guns
you stuck yo city, we stay on the road
you see me wearing platinum I quit wearin gold
you ridin factory I got candy paint
you sip Beveldere I sip on drank
we ride on swangas but we call em' too chrome
and everytime I do a show we buy new homes
 
(C-Note)
C-Note keep it hot like(??)
rolling 20-inches on a new (?casino?)
got connected wit Texas playas and a bad latino
and you can see me steppin out of a Lamborgino
cause we stackin mo chips then a damn casino
Big shots back accounts full of numbers and 0's
and check the new driveway for the Bentleys &amp; Beamos
and just to know our money strech
just as long as a Limo....and we Screwed up
