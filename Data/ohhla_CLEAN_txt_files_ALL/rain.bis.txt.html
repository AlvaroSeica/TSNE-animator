[Intro: Liz Rodrigues]
One...
Two...
Three...
Four...
 
[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
Waiting for the rain
Mirror in the hallway, no reflection
I think I've gone insane
Letters on the wall give me direction
 
[Bishop Lamont]
It's Friday night, I'm just sittin at home..
In the zone with the TV on
Lookin at Beyonce with some sexy shit on
Thinkin Jay better be hittin that shit right, holmes
Oooooh~!! Nigga, I would -- {*phone rings*} Phone ring
Interupt me from my dream, it's my nigga Naseem ("Ah shit, wassup my nigga?")
On the other end like, 
("Dude, what it do? It's ya b-day nigga, we got partyin to do!")
Nah, I'ma chill at the crib, take it slow
Bust a bitch here, it really ain't nowhere to go
("Hell no! You remember them bitches from the show?") - Naw
("And two bad bitches I met at the club dancin?") - Aight
("Called me up, talkin 'bout some party at her mansion")
Homie, it's rainin, I ain't trippin off that
("Well nigga I am, that white bitch ass was fat
  Fuck that, we rollin, be there in thirty, holla back!")
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bishop Lamont]
Wait a minute..
I hear a horn beep, it's Naseem in the driveway ("Here I come, man!")
And a voice sayin, "Bishop don't go, stay"
I brushed it off, hopped in, we slowly drove away
Tryna joke and shit, but the feeling won't go away
It's like I'm heavy in a cloud of dread
I'm lifeless, numb like I'm already dead
I turn the music up, flirt with the bitches in back ("Yo wassup?")
Yeah they pretty, feelin giddy off of purple kush sack
Forty minutes later, I'm like, "Where the fuck we at?"
Out in the middle of nowhere, the roads is pitch black
Finally we passed thru some creepy ass gates
Up a tall winding hill to a plush ass estate
Arrive inside, not too packed but it's poppin
Had a few drinks, bitches already jockin
Macked a cute freak, it's goin down for sure
Then the music go out, they pull out a Ouija board - What the fuck?
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bishop Lamont]
Yeah, they on some weird shit 
("What the fuck are these weirdos doin, man?") I just sit back and watch
Said they tryna summon Kurt Cobain and Tupac
I ain't witht hat Satan shit, this is where it stops
Grab they keys, "Naseem nigga, it's back to the block" ("Fuck that!")
Baby like, "Naw don't freak, it's just a game
We did this last time, it's the same ol' thang" ("Shit")
She grabbed me by the arms, pulled me back on the couch
Got that feeling like, "Leave nigga, you need to get out!"
While I think, another drink, even hit some weed
Watch they hands cross the boards start to glide slowly
They ask, "Who's with us?" 
It slides towards P -- then A -- and C
Weed got me stuck {*coughs*}, I don't believe what I see
It starts movin fast, it spells M-O-B
They ask, "Who killed you?" Then it just freeze
and flies off the board, a voice screamed, "SUGE SHOT ME"
They laugh and turn the lights up
But I don't find it funny, that shit was fucked up
I hops out my seat, I'm ready to leave
But my head starts swirlin and my nose begin to bleed ("Aw..shit!")
I can't stand, I stagger, almost fall
Naseem catch me, walk me to the bathroom down the hall
A shadow rushes for me, I pass out in the stall
Wake up, blood on the floor, it's on the walls
Glock in my hand, it's a bloody ass scene
Ev'rybody dead and my nigga Naseem
Out the window, flashing lights to the sirens
Forget I gripped the Glock, run out, they open fire
("Drop the weapon! Freeze! FREEZE!") {*gunshots*}
