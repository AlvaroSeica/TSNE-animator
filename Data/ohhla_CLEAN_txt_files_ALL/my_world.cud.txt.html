Hello...
Yeah..
Little homie, in the room
In, in the room
Boy on the moon
(Had-had no one)
No one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my little homies
One year younger din' get where I was going
Took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely
Lonely in my room, I, I mean me up on the moon
Entertained myself, laughed at myself
As I grew to be a teen I disguised myself
At the lowest self-esteem, especially with the girls
Tried out every sport just to impress all the girls
Instead of all the ladies, cause they talk down
I was too artsy, known to be a clown
And know my Facebook pop it
Cause I told the same girls I would be the hot shit
One day...

[Chorus: KiD CuDi] (Repeat 4x)
This will be my world 
I told you so..

[KiD Cudi] + (Billy Cravens)
Yeah, yeah
Big homie, made the move
Made, made the move
Flew off the moon
Still.. (Had-had no one)
No one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my Brooklyn niggas
All I would wonder is when will my time come
Had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them
Think about my bosses, yep I hated all of them
Studio at night had me hustlin' to most of them
Nigga I was late, damn near every day
But I'ma be on time when my stars align
When my soul is happy and my rhymin' die 
Followed by a loosey was the middle of grindin'
So if you knowin' the truth all you think about is that thing 
Always be a hater tryin' to shoot down any dreams
Until you meet a kid like K-I
Niggas thought I was crazy, my mama know I stay high
but get money, mom

[Chorus: Kid CuDi] (Repeat 4x)
This will be my world
I told you so..

[KiD CuDI]
I was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle and none of ya'll had a clue about me
And none of ya'll had a clue about me
And none of ya'll really knew about me
I was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle and none of ya'll really cared about me
And none of ya'll really cared about me
Now, guess what? I'm all you see
I'm all you see

[Chorus: KiD Cudi] (Repeat 4x)
This will be my my world
I told you so..</pre>
