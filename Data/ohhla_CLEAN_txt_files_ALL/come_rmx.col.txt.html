[Verse 1: Young Buck]
It's Buck Marley, now roll this up for me
I come on the Harley and left in the Ferarri (Seen!!!)
Lord have mercy, the guns you got me thirsty
I got to get me some of that Bermuda rum ya heard me?
I'm not just singin, I walked through Kingston
You say you from the ghetto, well that's the real meanin
I brought it with me, come on and party with me
My top shotta with me, incase they try to get me
Can't even see it's too cloudy my eyes blood shot
I need more fire, come on what the bloodclaat?!!!
Pon the river baby, badman go crazy, weedman 'gon love me 
Policeman 'gon hate me, we hollerin (Jah Jah children are risin!!!)
Waitin for my day to come so I can blow up babylon
Go 'head and have your slum, and tell me how you feel
This for my rastas I'm a show 'em what it is come down!!!

[Chorus: Collie Buddz]
Finally di herbs come around
Di hygrade weh mi look fah mi get it by di pound yeah
When Collie Buddz come around
A pure ganja man tune just a lick dem from di sound yeah
Finally di herbs come around
Di hygrade weh man a look fah mi stock it by di pound yeah

[Verse 2: Collie Buddz]
Ever since di herbs slow down, police and rudebwoy dem inna showdown

So, tell di yute dem now fi set field
Too much talk on cocaine a mek di world a feel ill yuh know
Nuff grade nuff spliff a build
Only ting weh a mek man feel still, hey, weh mi seh

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
Finally the herbs come around
Cause I'm off parole and I'm off probation
Clip the kush when we hit the toll
Cause the Po' Po' hatin Po' Po' waitin
I roam the streets with a big gun
I'm a crazy ass haitian from Port Au Prince nation
I got family out in Kingston
They some badman they blow out your brain mon
Now when it comes to war then spray them cannons
They got the max cause them Teks be jammin
Me and 50, Collie Buddz in the Phantom
We got some hoes in the back I need a condom
And when it comes to war you pick the wrong man
Cause my three five long it goes bam bam
A Bam bam, a bredrin homicide a come
A Bam bam, the weed smoke a fill up my lungs
A Bam bam, Yayo the teflon don
A Bam bam, We smoke herbs smoke by the pound
A Bam bam
