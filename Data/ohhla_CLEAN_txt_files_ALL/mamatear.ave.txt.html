[Intro]
Turn me up a lil' bit

[Verse One]
The dope game hard, the rap game easy
Industry niggas so motherfuckin sleazy
In the streets niggas 'gon try you if it's easy
Leave you like a bitch on a period bleedin
Real respect real almost in any case
When the fake get involved it turn to a murder case
Behind every death, it's a sucker in the mix
Sucker niggas get a real nigga in some deep shit
For instance Glenn, did different with Ben
Glenn told him get a chick I gotta check for ten
And hit shorty with two, if she clear in a week
Then it's eight bands left we split four grand a piece
Long story long Glenn jerked him instead
Fucked the bitch and count up and withdrew all of the bread
Ben caught him slippin put the slammer to his head
Took his jewels took it to the pawn shit was just led
Faker than the three dollar bill he wish he killed
Glenn sped back to his block right up the hill
Told the OG Butta, from the hood what happened
But he left out the part, 'bout him snakin and rappin
Said I was just chillin on Rutland, 'bout to kick it with a bitch
Then this hatin nigga Ben, ran up on me with some shit
I told the nigga if he 'gon pull it, then he better kill me!
Butta said what happened? Nigga took all your jewelry
Nah I ain't with it today, I kept it light
That nigga can't shoot anyway, so I'm aight
But he fucked up now, 'cause I know where he be
Matter fact big homey, won't you ride with me?!
Now Butta in the car, he don't play that shit
And he fittin to put a hole in a nigga
With his fo' fifth eight shot head trigger
There he go right there pull up a lil' nearer
I'm a get out, meet me on the corner stay on the right
Glenn said cool big homey, I got you aight
Ben ain't even seen it comin he caught that body with ease
And Glenn saw some people comin he thought it was the d's
But it wasn't, and he drove off 
But he hit the corner lookin like is this boy lost?
Now it's sirens, gun in hand lookin violent
He fit the description police just got the firin, now he gone 
And the moral of the story is, fuckin with suckers could get your mother tears
And the moral of the story is, when you fuck with them suckers could get your mother tears

[Outro]
This is my song, you can't defend wrong, 
You can't defend wrong, Maybe you'll listen if I put it in a, song, song, song, song
Maybe you'll listen if I put it in a, song, song, song, song, you can't defend wrong
The rap game hard, the dope game easy
Industry niggas so motherfuckin sleazy
In the streets niggas 'gon try you if it's easy
Leave you like a bitch on a period bleedin
Real respect real almost in any case
When the fake get involved it turn to a murder case
Real respect real almost in any case
When the fake get involved it turn to a murder case
