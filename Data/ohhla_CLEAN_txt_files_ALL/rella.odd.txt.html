[Intro]
I fucked this flow

[Hodgy Beats]
This is my electronic press kit, an artist on fresh shit
Nigga recollect bitch, grow grey hairs, don't stress it
I text message messages to fuckin estrogen
She lets me in, I sex her then she sexier than, my leather vans
Cause I never am purchasin, reimbursin your currency
Put your body on the curb you see to work the street, I hearse the streets
Heard she sweet, she Hershey's sweet, but me I'm extravagent
Hop on the bandwagon kid, I'm about to tell you some tragic shit
The love is lost and the drugs they cost, in the studio mixin raw
Bitchs shit in my drawers like you piss in my drawers
Nigga my dick's in her jaw
I'm Wes' Snipes with lead pipes, don't dabble with the apple
Cause a swagger like mine turn them apples into Snapple
Fuck the pick of the raffle, king of the castle
Nigga, Genghis Khan mansion, we the Marilyn Manson
Makin money in the present, in a safe for my grandsons
African drugs for when the champ come (beeitch~!)

[Domo Genesis]
Suicide watch nigga, kill yourself
Opposition who? Nigga reveal yourself
How you steal our swag and figure you still yourself?
+Splinter Cell+ creepin in this bitch, you couldn't feel the stealth
Wolves are prowlin, hunger at it's fuckin best
I'm a beast, like the gorilla head that is on my chest
Please let me flex, I'm goin off I need some fuckin bread
Drugs are green, my bitches white and tonight I need fuckin head
Excuse our swag, I'm tryin to tone it down like Jenny Craig
Fresh to death, and I guess we lookin like the living dead
Oh shit, yo' bitch look at how I'm doin you
Bitches on my dick but look at me, I'm fuckin beautiful
Niggas tryin to figure out, all I hear in my interviews
Is why this so cool? You niggaz are so unusual
Wolf Gang, point me to a nigga I should prove it to
Under pressure, we just stand in the middle like hula hoops

[BHodgy Beats]
The fortress is fortified (bitch)
Money in my pockets like I'm 45, Hodgy Beats recordin live
Bitch I be surely high, and I don't need wings to fly
I'm the air with the pigs, Left Brain, Domo Genesis

[Tyler, the Creator]
Knock knock, who's there? It's me
Your girlfriend had a really nice meeting with my dick (What?)
I killed that pussy and grabbed that knife
Now I got real authentic cheetah print shit
(Nigga you're a liar!) Nigga don't believe me
Kiss your lady; and boy you're gonna get them heebie jeebies
Nigga my dick stay way disease-y, I make it look easy
5150, I'm off the Heezy, you ain't got no fuckin Yeezy?
(5 albums, 100 songs, and you ain't got no fuckin Yeezy?
I bet you got some J-Kwon, you ain't got no fuckin Yeezy?)
Came in the game like Speedy Gonzalez, I'm fuckin Looney
See these girls talkin all that shit (what?)
I'm just tryna see some tits (what?)
Let's get it poppin like, MC Lyte, around some dykes
I'm, out this bitch like hocus pocus
And me and Lucas got a couple of pickles
And met up with bitches, gave 'em cum on their dimples
And then my dick went limp so
Took about 3 pills of Extenzo
Now my dick's longer than a 5 door limo
Harder than a soft right hook from Kimbo
on PCP and cilantro
When I'm with your bitch I'm like, "Where my dick go?"
Now she think I'm 'bout to eat her whole, enchilada
I gotta lotta that 'Preme and I'm payin nada
It seems that I'm product placement
but not I'm just fuckin awesome
Yo' momma look like a ugly... loser</pre>
