[Hodgy Beats]
I'm a lotta narcotics, flow aquatic atomic
The way I rhyme in Islamic promises, ignorance is common sense
I'm strainin my glottis, fuckin hungry hippopotamus
You niggaz are in the bottom pit, obnoxiousness
is what I was raised around as a child
I'd rather chuck up my middle finger than give a bitch a smile
Hostility fer-tile, like my mule and 40 acres
Stacy Adam gators, where's that motherfuckin stapler?

[Interlude]
Uhh, you hear that shit? Ay, run that shit back
Yeah that shit hot, nigga

[Hodgy Beats]
Hostility fer-tile like my mule and 40 acres
In my Stacy Adam gators, where's that motherfuckin stapler?
Good grades on the wall, niggaz hate to see me do it major
I'm just a leader of my team and I ain't afraid of traitors
Lacing my shoes, we the MellowHype jews
We controllin the crews, drinkin Belgium booze
We're animals out the zoos, with a fuse abused
Bitches brewin in our stews, on they knees like the pews

[Chorus One: repeat 2X]
Sock a buster, in his jaw
Fuck the police, break the law
Twist yo' fingers up, grip your balls
If you ain't got heart, you ain't got shit at all

[Chorus Two: repeat 2X]
Where your homies at? They'll get fucked up too
Where your grandma at? She'll get fucked up too
Where your bitch at? She'll get fucked up too
Where the roof at? We'll stomp that bitch through

[Interlude]
Here we go ne-gero, I'll sing figaro figaro
Chunkin up the Deuce Bigalow, burnin bodies in en-velopes

[Hodgy Beats]
Owwwwww muh'fucker wanna see you shine, and I got my gold on
Clancy said I'm late for my flight, well he better hold on
Can't wait 'til I fuckin buy me a jet, and there gon' be some hoes on it
Just blow O's on it, count dough on it
And mokin in the sky, damage the ozone, don't it?
Shit, I'll take a life for my moment's moment
Contract your own sale, fuck a deal you're in a auction
Turn the bass up, give muh'fuckers concussions
Rappers nowadays are all phased when it comes to soft shove
If niggaz saying your flow weak, you shoulda bought one
You call this brand new, to me it's Santa Cruz
Don't find HB the man to lose, no Anna bruise
Catch me on MTV or your local channel news
In London recordin to Fuse, I'm the man that confused
I'm fuckin crazy, need slavery to beat alien gravy
but I ain't sayin it til' your muh'fuckin brains gone~!
