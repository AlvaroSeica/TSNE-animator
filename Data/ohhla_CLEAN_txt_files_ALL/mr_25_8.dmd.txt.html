[Verse One: DJ DMD]
I'm DMD and I'ma hustler 25 hours
a day 8 days a week all work no play
first one on the scene I'm the last to leave
and if its money on the block
ya'll best believe that I'm right up
in the mix always on my grind
I gots to stack chips if I'm ever gon'shine
and blind these haters with some diamond rings
a playa grinding tryna have the finier things
plush SUV's forget the grain I want okley
the first man to buy my mama a mink coat and a
pink boat so she can sell the  7 seas
come down so hard the laws think I'm movin keys
but I slang raps like a dealer slang crack
a billion in the bank is what I aim at
I gotta name that fits me describe me to the D

[Chorus: DJ DMD 2x}
Call me Mr. 25-8

[Verse Two: DJ DMD]
now my mama told me to hustle and never
give up work hard and have faith
