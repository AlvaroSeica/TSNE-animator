Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I got a rocket in my pocket
And I'm ready to go
I'm talking tic tic time bomb
ready to blow
Just one more time
Gonna be all right
First class flight to the stars
Strap in pretty thing its gonna be a bump ride
Don't you hesitate
I'm gonna take you straight

To the moon babe
Me and you babe
To the moon babe
Are you ready to the ride?
I'm going till you beg me to stop

I'll be the supernova star tour
I'm your guide
your body is a rollercoaster
I wanna ride
One more time
Gonna be all right
First class flight to the stars
Strap in pretty thing its gonna be a bump ride
Don't you hesitate
I'm gonna take you straight

To the moon babe
Me and you babe
To the moon babe
Are you ready to ride?
I'm going to, going to

the moon babe
Me and you babe
To the moon babe
Are you ready to ride?
I'm going till you beg me to stop

Are you ready for the ride of your life?
I'm gonna give it to you
This is gonna take all night
When we start to countdown
It'll be a different my darling so
Hold on tight
You'll be throwing by the time you arrive

the moon babe
Me and you babe
To the moon babe
Are you ready to ride?
I'm going till you beg me to stop
