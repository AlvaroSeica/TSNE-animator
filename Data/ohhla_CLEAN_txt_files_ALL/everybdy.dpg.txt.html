[Chorus: Daz Dillinger] (Kurupt)
Everybody throw your guns in the air
And wave them motherfuckers like you just don't care
(Yeah, them gangstas came through grey &amp; blue all day
Just bangin' on these niggaz, stayin' true all day, ya know why?)
Cause I'm the one that ya can't fuck with (Fuck with)
I'm the one that ya can't get with (Get with)
It's the worst untouchable click (G shit)
You try to cross us you know we gon' trip

[Kurupt]
Kick in and I'ma blast, look at what we have
Too many bustas, not enough ass
I sip and then I blast... off
Sweep 'em all, call my doggs and we cause fog
Too much gun powder to see the wall
Hard to resist the gauge, rage it come
loose - Grey Goose, Hennessy, PatrÂ—n
Mama cock it, rock it, blast - we gon' beat ya ass
We gon' dump and ride past, me and Daz blast off
Bitch nigga, get bombed on and passed off
Sawed-off shotgun, hand on the pump
Too many niggaz to trip off just one
Bitch ass niggaz, you can act dumb
Act stupid if ya wanna, we gon' give ya what ya want
Me and all my niggaz used to Thunderbird it up
We ain't give a fuck now we all up in the club and

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger] (Kurupt)
Everybody throw your guns in the air
And wave them motherfuckers like you just don't care
(Yeah, them gangstas came through grey &amp; blue all day
Just bangin' on these niggaz, stayin' true all day, ya know why?)
Cause I'm the one that ya can't fuck with (Fuck with)
I'm the one that ya can't get with (Get with)
It's the worst untouchable click (G shit)
They try to cross us you know we gon' trip

[Daz Dillinger]
Gunshots rang out, where they all hang out
Seen 'em all spaz out, shoot up his glasshouse
Retaliate and shoot back, on where they hang at
That old school jackin' is back
Where everybody run up in your house with me, they packin' a strap
Don't make a wrong move or else there's one in your back
Or a bullet in your mouth slouched over the couch
Then rampack the house, get the money and bounce
Not givin' a fuck, yeah we hittin 'em up
If you say somethin' wrong be the first to get stuck
Fuck you, fuck him, matter fact fuck 'em all
Ditch the guns, split the funds, now we all on the run
Gangstas don't know about the way that we hang
The way that we hang, the way we do our thang nigga
It's D-A-Z in this bitch..
You know how we do, get a '6-4, hit a switch nigga

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger] (Kurupt)
Everybody throw your guns in the air
And wave them motherfuckers like you just don't care
(Yeah, them gangstas came through grey &amp; blue all day
Just bangin' on these niggaz, stayin' true all day, ya know why?)
Cause I'm the one that ya can't fuck with (Fuck with)
I'm the one that ya can't get with (Get with)
It's the worst untouchable click (G shit)
You try to cross us you know we gon' trip

[Daz Dillinger]
Ridin' in my '6-6, wheels spinnin'
Grill grinnin', drink spillin'
AK in the front (And I'm about killin')
Royal blue 20 inches, Dana Dane's
Inside cocaine white with my hand on that thang
Don't act strange, when you see me in the streets
Grab your heat, let off some shots, make your point discreet
Talk is cheap, actions speak louder than words
Stretch ya out on the curb, the lil' homie got nerves
I'm a Dogg Pound commander
Fuck givin' questions I give the answers
Chew ya ass up like cancer

[Kurupt]
It's like eagles, eagles don't fly in packs
But I'ma break that tradition, Soopafly in the back
Bitches on the counter shakin' ass for hours
This girl was off the meter off of weed and chowder
She should know better than to mix weed with powder
Powderhead bitch done lost her marbles
She gon' eat dick all night and all tomorrow
We got the amps on us, that keep them niggaz on us
That keep the triggers on us, them major figures on us
I bust ya shit, talk too much I'll bust ya bitch, ya know why?

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger] (Kurupt)
Everybody throw your guns in the air
And wave them motherfuckers like you just don't care
(Yeah, them gangstas came through grey &amp; blue all day
Just bangin' on these niggaz, stayin' true all day, ya know why?)
Cause I'm the one that ya can't fuck with (Fuck with)
I'm the one that ya can't get with (Get with)
It's the worst untouchable click (G shit)
You try to cross us you know we gon' trip

It's just that gangsta music
It's just that gangsta music
It's just that gangsta music that's blowin' ya brain
It's just that gangsta music
It's just that gangsta music
It's just that gangsta music that's blowin' ya brain</pre>
