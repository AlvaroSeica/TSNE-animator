[Tyga]
They say what goes around comes around ('round)
And I know I made mistakes and you forgave me how (how)
I don't understand, you know I'm tryin' the best I can (can)
I guess it's consequences when you dealin' with sin (sin)
And even sacrificed your friends over me
All them nights in the club turn to nights with me
It's like the same old story out your diary
Memories never fade but only in time we'll see; hope to see you with me cause...

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Myyyy heart beats, for you, girl you know are the one
Are you maaaad at me? Girl I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up
But myyyy heart beats, for you baby - Imma go and scream it LOOOUD~!
But if you leave it's something I can't control
So let's do it one last time, and fuck for the road

[Tyga]
Grippin' and bitin', remember the times after fightin'?
You said you loved me, I liked it; became obsessed with the sexin'
You screamin' Whos is it?" We naked, now I'm pullin your hair told you take it
A couple of shots, now we faded; don't even know we made it - we home
Got that look in your eyes like hope you mine
Said you hoped the feelings real, really tired of all the lies
One minute we fine, then we not, everything I do you can't 
but that's no reason for making mistakes, this time put it all on the plate
I, I told you be loyal, spoil you, never disown you
You get lonely when I'm touring just hold it down be supportive
I'll be back in the morning that new purse you wanted
What's good if you can't flaunt it, flaunt it, show it?
Ain't the same better than the rest? (Rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to make, make you understand - make you understand that...

[Chorus]

[Chris Brown]
All I ever wanted, was, your, happiness
But right now let's get right down to it, let's handle this business
If you gonna leave me tonight, I gotta kiss it goodbye
Girl I'm bout to make it cry, and all I need is one more TIIIME cause myyyy...

[Tyga]
Last time, best time, better than my next time
Rolex and vest time, Moët it's sex time
Hard to let go, a part of you gon be alone
Scrollin' your phone, lookin' at texts, seems like not too long ago
Ain't the same better than the rest? (Rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And it's no way I can pay you back (back)
But my plan is to make, make you understand - make you understand that
