[Enock]
Do we truly know what the Lord cares about
let alone His where-abouts
God's not in these places where people think faith is
coming to the Lord with there hands stuck out
Remember, the Lord dismissin' the droves
cause they only came for the fish and the loaves
true seekers of God are hard to find
when you seek His heart and mind
You'll start to find
Faith in the gospel
there's your gift, treasure it, watch out for those heretics
Who make God out to be some genie in a bottle like the Christina Agalera hit
Wheat and tares there's a split
be aware of it when the scripture hits you right
It'll switch ya' plight
that's how you'll know you're out of darkness
And into light

[The Ambassador]
This beat is hot now I got to heat the spot
feed the flock and pray that non-believers stop
We grow together both weed and crop
so you need to take heed to the seed I drop
Jesus, up in every piece I drop
time's running out so we gotta beat the clock
Peep it Ock
I hear you smoke weed a lot you need the pot
you know that you need to stop
You keep a knot
you got more doe than a pizza shop
showin' all the gold teeth you got
You keep a fox in the front seat of the jeep you got
and you keep it locked
Won't go to church til' you Easter shop
new suit and shoes and a Easter top
People stop and say yo! He's the shot
but God says No he's not'
God is known to police the block He's the cop
that aint afraid to squeeze the Glock
but He really loves me a lot'
you don't know what His steez is or what His steez is not
You face the place where eternity is hot
I'm not afraid to say hell some need the shock
His wrath is laser sharp, I see the dot
trust Him before your breathin stops

[The Tonic]
Now let's stick to the text
though we wish men were X
sin's hex mutates into death effect
Weed sex guns Lex and we love the Vex
Evil's got us wide open like Nasanex?
And for some, this life's like a major bet
they put all their chips up on a major set
But when they loose to the one with the major flex
ain't nothing left but a major debt
Yet it's more then a loss of  pay
every body wanna floss and play
guzzle Covisier
Somebody better check God's dossier
He ain't accepting everything you want to toss His way
But you love the game
want the fame, not the blame
not the shame, not the pain
not the flame, but it's all in vain
cause even demons know his name
big boy

[The Phanatik]
You know His name
but do you really know why He came
before your games' up
I think you better find out
take a pause for the cause while you playing call a time out
Boy, you ought to check in with the coaching staff
running plays and don't know the half
seeming like you making up your own meaning
like you playin a game of bolder-dash
Taking common grace, look at the time you waste
I know you want to see His shining face
but you're separated by time and space
til Jesus Christ came and climbed in our place
and took the cross, took a loss
tasted death then shook it off
Rose in three
said roll with me like rotary
now look at ya'll
Making noise with crazy joy
like young bucks when they play with toys
Predestined since way back when man we go back like Lazy Boys
but all to Him and none to me
was pinned by sin like 1,2,3
He healed me, filled me, saved me gave me life abundantly

[Chorus]
How could you say that we cool but you don't know me
plus my word is foolish to you
But we can get to know one another
if you choose me we can take it further
You don't know me, no you don't know me
know me
You  don't know me, no you don't know me, no
But you can know me  know me, yeah you can know me
know me
You can know me, through Christ you can know me
What you know about this?
Huh, what ? huh? huh? huh? what?</pre>
