[Chorus x3: Timbo King (Killah Priest) w/ adlibs]
(Here we go!)
We the Maccabee ridaz
(Fall out, call on to the moon
Watch how we move, follow platoons, salute!)
We the Maccabee ridaz
(Fall out, call on to the moon
Watch how we move, follow platoons, salute!)
We the Maccabee ridaz
(Fall out, call on to the moon
Watch how we move, follow platoons, salute!)
We the Maccabee ridaz
(Fall out, call on to the moon
Watch how we move, follow platoons, salute!)
We the Macs!

[Timbo King]
We spit that evolution, that Huey P. Newton
I shoot a cop in the face, watch riot lootin'
Cuz that's my gun! From the days of Akbar
to the Phillip Murph's, yeah we on ya turf
A wise man had once said, "It ain't over 'til pronounced dead"
My soul belongs to the most high
I tell the truth, shame the devil with the most lies
Listen close, you might learn somethin'
Maccabeez start the revolution, burn somethin'
Dry bones and they lackin' knowledge
Got dropouts back in college
Grown talk, we ain't speakin' childish
Either you with me or against me
No Kuntakente's or Kizis
Fear of a black planet since the '60s
Feel the movement, what you sissy?
Yeah...

[Chorus]

[Killah Priest]
I got guns with banana clips, run with my hammer clicks
Beef I could handle it, watch how I take grammar, swift
When they see my Desert E's, they just freeze
When I spits it, make a nest of enemies
Same way evil make a nest in the streets
Priest rockin' any flow, everywhere my semi go
Slugs I got plenty mo', hit you up with plenty holes
Hooks, crooks, killas and gangstas
Israelite, henches, God's crop, niggaz I hang with
Revolutionaries blowin' on trees
Pull-ups we do in sets in threes, begets, fatigues
You know, everyday a different chick I'm with
Every one of them say that this nigga is sick
Ridiculous, when I plant my dick in chicks
And we about guns like Malcolm, when we start to spit
Political beef is always the outcome

[Chorus]

[Hell Razah]
Fuck the world, praise the Lord, homey gimme that gun
We sell cakes but we had to learn to bake it from crumbs
The Catholic priest touchin' boys, enslavin' their nuns
The blackout off the drums, hear the savior come
It's either jail or the morgue so I'm wavin' my sword
It was war when they cut that umbelical cord
Understand my pain, we only use a few percent of our brain
The other half is payin' rent, what the pen is to claim
Gettin' tax free street money's the name of the game
Who to trust when the snake is the head of ya gang
Got ya mind manipulated not thinkin' it's strange
How you spent ya own money and you bring him the change
They told a light skinned you better than a dark skinned slave
So we sit with AK's 'til they bury our graves
And they change our last name back to the ancient of days
Hold my left arm attached to a Genesis page

[Chorus]

[singer]
I'm so high, I'm so high...
I'm so hiiiiiiiiiiigh...
I'm so high, I'm so high...
I'm so hiiiiiiiiiiigh...</pre>
