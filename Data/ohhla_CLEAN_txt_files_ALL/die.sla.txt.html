[Intro: Sway talking to a live crowd]
Aight look, I seen these guys backstage
I'ma say it right now, there isn't a group, in the rap game today
that lyric for lyric, can out-rap these next dudes
I know it for a motherfuckin fact
I know it cause I'm from the West Coast 
and I was there when Crooked I first came on the scene
When Joell Ortiz first came on the scene
When Joe Budden first came on the scene
And one of the illest lyricists in the game 
when Royce Da 5'9" first came on the scene
"Welcome to Our House," give it up for SLAUGHTERHOUSE!!

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
Everything you been askin for yes I'm about to give it to you
You ain't gotta worry no more cause I'm about to put one through you
I got a bullet with your name on it comin through the radio
Sounds like I got an AK dumpin straight through the radio
If you tryin to be target practice you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that
Someone's gonna die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ie-ie-ie, die tonight

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Nigga this that shooter music, I'm about that life so much
I might go touch my rifle's butt and my dick just might go up
Nigga that nostril on that rifle'll knock the snot right out ya
Try me and I'll try out ya, the drum on that gun is Beta like Phi Alpha
Uh, but it ain't no frat niggaz in the hood be callin me Tackleberry
And if he's eyein, he will have him an easier time tryin
to put on some pads and goin and tryin to tackle Barry
Then he'll go against this goddamn G-4 buyin Detroit Lion
I'm about that life so much I might go golf
Try to get me a hole-in-one'll remind of like when I go off
Homicidal thoughts, bodies outlined in chalk by the time it's dark
Dahmer signin his name on the dotted line with a bloody body part
I don't give a fuck if they whylin, I got a clip of fuckin Ray Allens
Sellin that Sarah Palin in, broad day or Letterman, Fallon
When I shoot this iron all you hear is hoopin and hollerin
like, "BOOOOMBS AWAY!!" Bootsy Collins

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
They shot my nigga three times, as his abdominal bled
they robbed him for phenomenal bread, that domino led
to other dominos fallin in his clique, off with their heads sick
Saw him in that hospital bed, leaned away from the doctors said they all'll be dead
soon, and I'm talkin before that nurse can change a I-V
I'ma put 'em in the dirt, leave 'em leakin raspberry-flavored iced tea
My G, kill him and take his ID
I'm a +Renagade+ like E-M-I-N-E-M and J-A-Y-Z!
Bitch it's karate, it's Mr. Miyagi mixed with Issey Miyake
Smell that chopper kickin when it's liftin your body
Quick as Bugattis, then I'm hittin the Omni
with a chicken lickin my dick in the lobby, this New Edition I'm Bobby
+Fast Laner+ - I'm speakin the truth, put three in the coupe
I'ma wet yo' head like a leak in the roof then I'm leavin the booth a gas chamber
My granny callin me a rap singer
But she don't know I use my strap finger {*BLAOW*}

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Look, this a whole 'nother +Ether+, hop out, black mask, low Caeser
Tell the goonies keep it low with the reefer
New bodies on old heaters, we ain't wrapped too tight
Starvin, they thought Jeffrey Dahmer had an appetite
I'm detailed, not derailed, don't lay your head if you shit by it
Got skeletons but my shit private, I paved the way, y'all misguided
So try it I'ma send a threat, tie her up don't end her yet
Bullet go through your wife eye/wi-fi now we know you ain't on the internet
In my head I see amateurs, can't retain a memory
All I'm left with is images, with that I'm puttin emphasis
And in parenthesis put he's hated by large percentages
And all my nemesis won't even let him on the premises
One shot change him for life, he'll be belligerent
Even his text messages gon' read like he whisperin
Bullet-proofed the hoodie for Trayvon Martin
Then go to war with the cops, even they aren't pardoned
What up!

[Chorus]</pre>
