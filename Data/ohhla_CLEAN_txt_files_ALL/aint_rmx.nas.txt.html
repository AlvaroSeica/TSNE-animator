{Intro}
Take it to the bridge
To the motherfuckin' bridge
Queensbridge in the motherfucker
(Hook)
It ain't hard to tell
*repeat 3x

[Verse 1]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well
You feel it like braille ain't hard to tell
I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill
Plus Matic I freak a beat
Slam it like Iron Shiek
Jam like a tech with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas could rock well
It ain't hard to tell

(Hook)
It Ain't hard to tell
*repeat 3x

[Verse 2]
What's a beat if the rap don't click
I spit rhymes like I'm sick, dying loss in a pit
The only way I can escape is by vocals
Verbalize a strife
Stabbin' ears like a knife hood like
The Prophet of the gutter
Lyrics are silk mega butter
I flow never stutter
Clever poetic brothers on a mission
Dissin' all who perps the fraud
Scrams listen, (and) do what the experts record
Burn your pen and pads, mics you'll need not
Well I be packin' like a rasta in a weed spot
Hittin' your hearts like a hollow tip
Verbally illin' minds manipulated
My raps a nickel-plated
I illustrate it, X-rated, then move out
Nas the parlayer takes you on a new route
It's suicide poetry released from a cell
With immense clientele, I excel
It ain't hard to tell

(Hook)
It ain't hard to tell
*repeat 3x

[Verse 3]
Now, I'm blessed with the finesse to express like Shakespeare
The blocks "Cape Fear" drop metaphors when the breaks clears
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like "The Shining", sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin
And in my physical, I'll express through song
Delete stress like Moltrin, extend strong
Drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns inhale
From the spliff that I lifted in Hell
It ain't hard to tell
(Hook)
It ain't hard to tell
