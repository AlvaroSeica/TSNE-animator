Ryze: Revenge on my ex-man, who betrayed my trust
My  venom's pumping, cause this an adrenaline rush
He violated immediate fam in despicable lust
Now he's giving me a reason for my heat to bust
I bet you think I think clearly in the morning
Get the fuck off my conscience! This cat will never see the dawning
A new day, The last thing on his my mind was a hot shell
Through the barrel of my AK
Anni: Yo hold up Ryze, I'm hearing all that bile you're speaking
But let's sit and talk a little 혩bout that violence you preaching
Ryze: Fuck that, feel the burner hear my tire's screeching
Step away you're in path for the drawer, I'm reaching
Anni: Reaching? What you a gangsta now, How do you figure?
You might own a Eagle, but I know you never squeezed the trigger
Ryze: Please nigga, what the fuck you think you know about my threshold?
There's only so much hurt and pain my mind and flesh hold
Anni: Yeah, I feel you. But right now you're just a little upset
You don't wanna go out there and do something you're sure to regret
Ryze: That's a bet? Watch me make this brother take the big snooze
Check the pulse around twelve and I ain't talking 혩bout the news
Anni: Come on man! Ryze: Get out my way Anni: Naw you ain't getting to this drawer
Let me tell you a thing or two before you jet off to war

Chorus
If ya, live the life, you can talk the talk
Most of y'all can only dream to walk the walk
When you rap about gun play, you glamorize the tragedy
Talking like a killer but it's all just a fantasy
It's just a fantasy, it's all just a fantasy
Get it out your head 혩cause it's all just a fantasy
It's just a fantasy, it's all just a fantasy
Talking like a killer but it's all just a fantasy

Anni: I know you're kind of hot but try to listen to words
So simmer down cowboy before you trip on your spurs
Each year ten thousand people die from gun related violence
That's ten thousand funerals and twenty thousand parents crying
So watch how you portray it, this shit ain't entertainment
This is blood guts and bits of skull and brain on the pavement
I know that Tupac rhymes make it sound hot to pop nines
But you feel so damn live when you get shot five times
I know what you're thinking. Ryze: Now you sounding like an After School Special
I ain't your student brethren. Stop teaching foolish lessons
Anni: I'm saying, take a second to think before playing with heat
That's the reason Skitzo put a delay in the beat

Chorus
If ya, live the life, you can talk the talk
Most of y'all can only dream to walk the walk
When you rap about gun play, you glamorize the tragedy
Talking like a killer but it's all just a fantasy
It's just a fantasy, it's all just a fantasy
Get it out your head 혩cause it's all just a fantasy
It's just a fantasy, it's all just a fantasy
Talking like a killer but it's all just a fantasy

Ryze: Kid crossed the line now he signed his death warrant
Anni: And just when I was getting through to you, guess I wasted breath for it
Ryze: I'm about to read him last rites becuase he be seeing his last nights
Anni: Okay but before you take this man's life make sure you blast right
You think it's that simple to bust a round at a temple?
It ain't so easy gripping pistols when your fingertips tremble
So non chalant about popping cats, you hopping mad, but drop the act
The only time you're wetting shirts is at the laundry mat
Ryze: Fuck you. Anni: No fuck you, you make it seem like blasting's a requirement
You ain't in the struggle, this is a middle class environment
And fuck you for undermining those dying, you pose trying
To show violence but guess what your flow's lying
Ryze: Get the fuck out of my way Anni, gimme the Eeze
Anni: What the fuck Ryze! Ow, yo! You're ripping my sleeve
Ryze: Anni let go of this gun
Anni: Naw you let go son
Ryze: get the fuck out of my way cause I'm gettin' this job done
