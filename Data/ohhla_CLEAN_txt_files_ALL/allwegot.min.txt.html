[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Look, more of the same
I'm cornered to gain
Back and forth, forth and back
With the name recording pain
You played back, when them insecurities rang
And I ain't even gotta answer, but the question remains
Uhh
Why everything inside of my brain not applied?
It's insane, but yo I'm trying to change
Decided to ditch my strength and rely on the King
Mama said at the end of yourself is where it begin
So, I'm totally free, embracing my limitations
Wishing my heart moved at the same pace of this information
Uhh
I pray this ain't strange
What I'm saying, but I'm trying
To find a back door to your imagination
I'm here, let me in to be clear
I'm bringing something, make you wonder
Who's the one that gave the gifts that I fear
What happen next? I think about it, do you ever?
I can give you an answer but a question do you better like
Uhh...

[Chorus: Dimitri McDowell]
Have you ever loved
The treasures of this world
When it's insanity?
Cause it's killing me
Have you ever tried to be something you're not?
Cause I've been searching for security
Oh na na na
His love is all we got

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Uhh
I'm trying to go from selfish to selfless
Not just thinking bout my needs but someone else's
All these pretty women in my city isn't helping
No matter how hot that body, one day it's melting
Yo
A good lie got a little truth in it
So I'm trying to decide what's real and embellished
The money coming in so everybody's good fellas
I don't trust em, no phone numbers
Tell em email us
Can you tell? I've been affected by this industry
Numbers and CD sales, what the heck has gotten into me?
I had to ask myself, what's a win for me?
Do I worship God or what other people think of me?
Sobering thoughts depleting my hot air
Thinking bout this world when I'm not here
Will I treasure money or the moments that we share?
It's funny how seeing death can make life so clear
I got a girlfriend but so long it feels weird
It's not like, "Yo can I get to know you?"
More like, "Meet my parents."
I think I'm scared cause it's serious and
Every time I tell somebody they trying to marry us
Pump the brakes
I think I love her but them words ain't sit still
Cause last time I did things didn't end well
Plus plus my past was hashtag been trill
It's time to grow up, you know what?
I ain't trying to be another bum that's just scared of committing
Take everything from these women and go miss it
I gotta kill the wicked part of my heart that keeps pimping
If I ain't got the strength
Then I know where to get it
Uhh
You live different when you know you've been forgiven
His love is forever, don't you ever forget it
You live different when you know you've been forgiven
His love is forever, don't you ever forget it

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Please speak your mind, I'm wide open
Love you for you girl, let it be hard girl
Lay it on the line, tell me are you precious
I promise I won't judge you, try not to judge me

[Chorus]</pre>
