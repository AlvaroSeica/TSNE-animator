[Intro/Chorus: Cee-Lo]
I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you-ooo-ooo-ooh"
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and 
Forget her too!"
I said, "If I was richer
I'd still be with ya"
Ha, now ain't that some {{shhhhhhhhh?}} (Ain't that some {{shhhhhhhhh?}})
And 'though there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best, with a...
Forget you-ooo-ooo-ooh!

[First Verse]
Look here, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
Huh, I guess he's an Xbox, and I'm more Atari
Mmm, but the way you play your game ain't fair

Uh, I pity the FOOOOOL-HOOOO that falls in love with you, oh oh
({{Oh}} {shit}, she's a gold digger) Well
(Just thought you should know, {nigger})
OOOO-OO-OOO-OOOOOH, I've got some news for you, huh-hah
Yeah, gone and run tell ya lil' boi-friend

I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you-ooo-ooo-ooh"
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and 
Forget her too!"
I said, "If I was richer
I'd still be with ya"
Ha, now ain't that some {{shhhhhhhhh?}} (Ain't that some {{shhhhhhhhh?}})
And 'though there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best, with a...
Forget you-ooo-ooo-ooh!

[Second Verse]
Now I know, that I had to borrow
Hah, beg and steal and lie and cheat, ah
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
'Cause being in love with your {ass} ain't cheap

Naw, I pity the FOOOOOL-HOOOO that falls in love with you, oh oh
({{Oh}} {shit}, she's a gold digger) 
Well (Just thought you should know, {nigger})
OOOO-OO-OOO-OOOOOH, I've got some news for you, huh-hah
OOH!!! I really hate your {ass} right now

I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you-ooo-ooo-ooh"
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and 
Forget her too!"
I said, "If I was richer
I'd still be with ya"
Ha, now ain't that some {{shhhhhhhhh?}} (Ain't that some {{shhhhhhhhh?}})
And 'though there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best, with a...
Forget you-ooo-ooo-ooh!

[Bridge]
Now baby, baby, baby
Why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so baaaad)
I tried to tell my momma, but she told me,
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad) Yes she did
And I was like

Uh! Whhhhhhhy?! 
UH! WHHHHHHHY, LADYYYY?
OH! I love you! 
OH! I STILL LOVE YOOOOOU, OHHHHHHHH!

I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you-ooo-ooo-ooh"
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and 
Forget her too!"
I said, "If I was richer
I'd still be with ya"
Ha, now ain't that some {{shhhhhhhhh?}} (Ain't that some {{shhhhhhhhh?}})
And 'though there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best, with a...
Forget you-ooo-ooo-ooh!</pre>
