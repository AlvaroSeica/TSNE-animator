She walk like she got headphones, rockin' Aretha
Lady of light, the type that you'd like to speak ta'
Hard to reach, sorta speaks like a drink of water
Far from a leaf though it's hard being the king's daughter
Not really into order but her expectations call for a man to be strong
Plus patience, see, you can admire the flower
But understand, you dealing with a woman and a higher power
And my father in Heaven must've gave her the Earth
'Cause the money don't impress her, yo she know what she's worth
And she knows rebirth, and she can feel it
Went through too much hurt to conceal it
It's not what she say, it's the way she reveals it
And how the world wanna steal it
That spirit in which her body's a home to
Sorry world, she's outgrown you

(Chorus)
Outta the gates to the wild blue
Sky's too great, she gotta escape, fly through
With a smile to kinda remind you
You gotta look ahead and not behind you
She said staring at the sun won't blind you
It's just a lie used by the world to confine you
But I know a place they won't find you
And if you believe, you can fly like I do

Absolutely beautiful, the type that make you feel unsuitable
She's uncommon, ain't nothing about her usual
If you've had known her before the transition
You'd be amazed by the change man, listen
She used to go from this one to that one
To feel complete, she looked for men to make it happen
Until she started asking, if all things in this world should pass then
Show me something that's everlasting
That's when she met true love, not the word but the action
Taking her to way back when, she was Eve in the garden of Eden (hehe)
Before the apple was eaten, before she used to be the Queen of clubs
Now it seems she's a wild card, born again, child of God
With a style a little odd for any normal man to marry
But she fits in just fine with the revolutionaries

(chorus)
Outta the gates to the wild blue
Sky's too great, she gotta escape, fly through
With a smile to kinda remind you
You gotta look ahead and not behind you
She said staring at the sun won't blind you
It's just a lie used by the world to confine you
But I know a place they won't find you
And if you believe, you can fly like I do
