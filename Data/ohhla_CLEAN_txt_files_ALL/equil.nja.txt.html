[Verse 1]
Still there when road darkens, kill with spears when the foes 
Marching feeling fear, from your whole squadron          	
No pardons, real severe and I'm cold 
Hearted, ninja's clearly the most monstrous	         	
Throats are slit in the coliseum
Pose harsh risk and demolish heathens			
Boxers bleeding, got the stoppage I'm bobbing
And weaving, props and homage or theres carnage and grieving		
It's sorrow for weaklings there's pain and anguish
I'm macho when seiging your reign is anquished			
The blade is brandished, enraged when you take
Advantage you're slained by the danger's damage			
Remain a savage, my wrath is blind
Maim then vanish in callous times			
I'm keen, hid and wear the veil
I dream big, and dare to fail			

[Verse 2]
I'm where bravado and terror's from, tommorrow may never come 
I war chant and follow the nearest drum		
You perish from the fists, when it pounds yall
The jealous ones will wish for my downfall		
Keep at the helm and steer my own ship
Creep in the realm prepared, I won't slip			
Woeful attack, lone will lash out
Go to the mat, foes will tap out			
Hang on after others let go
Stand strong have the hunger tenfold			
Plunder and roam, scourge the traitors
The hunter is cold, a terminator				
Foes is threatened, spies are shuddering
The soul is strengthened with trials and suffering		
You don't know, I think you should watch then
Where hope grows, miracles blossom</pre>
