{Verse 1}
First thangs first I'ma spit some gangsta shit bout my Ruger 9
Bitch ass niggaz ya know its best that ya stay in line
First name Ruger wit the last name Nina
A bitch like this could never carry no Misdemenor
If you want some static just run ya bitch ass up
Ya ass is fine as deceased so shut the fuck on up
Mr., Mr. Ivan the dangerous mother fucker
Slingin his love with the Louisville slugger
Led in my clip so run fa cover you cock roaches
Blast on that ass with the quickness, leave my chamber smokin'
Leavin a mother fucker bleedin to death
She aint never leavin my heart cause she one trusted bitch
*Brrrrrbadeeeep* shit my Ruger bustin them shots mayne
She's real as a fuck and im like motha fuck a gut mayne
Point blank range my gun get wild like a drunky G
You'll be like a bitch if you eva try to fuck with me
Its best ya stay ya bitch ass in line
I got love for my black bitch nigga... My Ruger 9

{Hook}
First thing thats comin in to my mind that
I got to get my mother fuckin Ruger 9'n (ruger 9 nigga)
First thing thats comin in to my mind that
I got to get my mother fuckin Ruger 9'n (I gots to have it Daddy)

{Verse 2}
The first day I seen my bitch I fell in love nigga
I got hot the second my finga pulled the trigga
My first nut came when i killed my first victim
His body fell face first when the hollow hit him, huh
See I aint shocked because my Ruger's my popper jack
But niggaz talk shit but watch how many nigga I subtract
The block is MINE when i pull out my Ruger 9
Police cant harrass me, I got papers you know its mine
Shot after shot so take heed when I start to blast
Nuttin gon stop me from puttin these points in ya bitch ass
I would carry my Ruger 9 in a nightmare
Got a hollow tip straight to your back I could tell your scared
Fuck it I'm about to pull my shit and go the blastin'
I'm usin my Ruger the second I go to Jackin
I have no love for no bitch but my nina
And if ya caught stuntin and frontin shit well I'ma shoot ya, huh
There aint no runnin from a slug
My Ruger has no love for a nigga have you drownin in ya own gut
I have you waitin on the trigga
You cant seperate me and my shiny black bitch, nigga

{Hook)

(Verse 3}
I dont need no bitch as long as i gots my nina
My Ruger fit perfect with the trigga happy finga
Bullets gon be spittin with alota speed
I'm bustin a cap inside yo chest with the hollow makin niggaz bleed
I go the laughin from the time i hear my Ruger bust
You shoulda ducked cause now ya ass is stuck up in the dark bleedin to death
Who is they rep?
They shouldnt a step
Movin crowds cant fuck with my Ruger take ya last breath
Its best you watch my Ruger 9 when I lose control blowin
Holes in ya chest about the size of a sewer hole
There aint no gettin up from that shit in the mornin nigga
Cause layin that nina down and then I'm doin 12 killings
A Ruger slug droppin low like Hiroshima
Blast on that ass with the quickness with my girl Nina
Ya step wrong then that ass mine
A 9th WARD mother fucker with the GAT, My Ruger 9

{Hook}
First thing thats comin in to my mind that
I got to get my mother fuckin Ruger 9'n (ruger 9 nigga)
First thing thats comin in to my mind that
I got to get my mother fuckin Ruger 9'n (I gots to have it Daddy)
First thing thats comin in to my mind that
I got to get my mother fuckin Ruger 9'n (ruger 9 nigga)
First thing thats comin in to my mind that
I got to get my mother fuckin Ruger 9 (let me get that out ya) MOTHA FUCCA
