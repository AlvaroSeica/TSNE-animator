[Intro]
Women are stupid and I don't respect them
That's right, I just have sex with them

[Chorus]
Show me your genitals, your genitals - WHAT!
Show me your genitals - genitalia!
Show me your genitals, your genitals - WHAT!
Show me your genitals - genitalia!

[Verse One]
You're talking to me about stuff... why?
I'd rather see your titties
Now you're talking about other stuff... why?
I'd much rather see your titties
I can't have sex with your personality
And I can't put my penis in your college degree
And I can't shove my fist in your childhood dreams
So why you sharing all this information with me?
It's not sexist cause I'm saying it in a song
That's right bitch~! Now take off your thong and

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Knock knock, who's there? It's me
Wonderin why you're not naked
Know knock, who's there? Me again!
Still wonderin why you're not naked
I wanna see your bum, I don't care what you say
No I don't have feelings, cause feelings are gay
Something something in the month of May
Bitches love my penis cause it's really big
Girls' brains are much stupider than men's are
So they should always listen to us cause we're smart
Women are only good for three things
Cooking, cleaning... and vaginas

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I can give good sex to you
Cause I'm really good at sex
I can give good sex to you
Cause I'm really good at sex

[Outro]
Ahh yeah, that's right
Shake your... bums
I'm out of here, I've gotta go have sex with a lot of girls</pre>
