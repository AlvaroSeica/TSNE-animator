(Chorus)
[Benjilino]
Somebody gonna die tonight
Get all of my niggaz, time to ride tonight
Disrespect a killa and them bullets gonna fly tonight
A nigga gonna die tonight
Somebody gonna die tonight
Get all of my niggaz, time to ride tonight
Disrespect a killa and them bullets gonna fly tonight
A nigga gonna die tonight

(Verse 1)
[Tech N9ne]
Hey yo I'm sick as a motherfucker, bitch you a motherfucker
You tryin' to diss on a motherfucker like me I'll kill you motherfuckers
Its a motherfuckin' shame how the motherfucker came
And grabbed my motherfuckin' name, And get to blowin' out ya motherfuckin' brains
I fuck hoes like a motherfucker, Even yours you motherfuckers
Tech N9ne is a motherfucker, I'll dispose of you motherfuckers
Pros, They wanna suck us, +Mitch Bade+ niggaz wanna buck us
Get the motherfucker, Hit the motherfucker
Kill'em and dont say shit, Motherfucker
I'm pissed them a motherfucker, Twist that motherfucker
Lift that motherfucker, Hey nigga you my motherfucker
Cause you busted on them motherfuckers, Shot up they motherfuckin crew
Motherfuckers who diss me, Motherfuck you
I'm raw as a motherfucker, Stand tall as a motherfucker
Punks is a motherfucker, Pop trunks on these motherfuckers
Niggaz is wrong as a motherfucker, Wont get a motherfuckin' thing
Trip of this motherfuckin' heat we bring
Motherfucker

(Chorus)
[Benjilino]
Somebody gonna die tonight
Get all of my niggaz, time to ride tonight
Disrespect a killa and them bullets gonna fly tonight
A nigga gonna die tonight
Somebody gonna die tonight
Get all of my niggaz, time to ride tonight
Disrespect a killa and them bullets gonna fly tonight
A nigga gonna die tonight

(Verse 2)
[Fatal Hussien]
I was raised up to blaze bang blicks
Hussien gets pissed if flames spit
Watch how pretty the pain get
Nigga, High til I die, Burry me a G
I'm strapped, A made nigga never worry me, I'm free
This is stricly for my niggaz now
Bless the dead, You know life goes on, We pour out a lil' liquor now
All these niggaz is hoes, And they wanna be Pacs
But I'm puttin' presure up on 'em when they under these glocks
And these pussies are panicked, To get frantic, Cause me and Yuk here
Somebody gonna die, Not me, Nigga I'm stuck here
Rap related, Criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't want to be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle
Complete most early on the streets of the east coast
Young guns fire, And niggaz bleed smoke
Addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon
While beefin with rookie cops, For the cookie rocks niggaz sellin'
I'm an Outlaw

(Chorus)
[Benjilino]
Somebody gonna die tonight
Get all of my niggaz, time to ride tonight
Disrespect a killa and them bullets gonna fly tonight
A nigga gonna die tonight
Somebody gonna die tonight
Get all of my niggaz, time to ride tonight
Disrespect a killa and them bullets gonna fly tonight
A nigga gonna die tonight

(Verse 3)
[The Realest]
You see our adversaries crumble when we rumble with sick catasrophy
Fuck all these niggaz, It's the West in me
Thats why I gotta keep a vest with me, And I'mma ride 'til I rest in peace
[Yukmouth]
Makaveli rest in peace, All these wannabe's like Master P
All these niggaz screamin' blastephemy
You aint Pac nigga, Tatted up in them magazines
Bandanna'ed up in them magazines
You aint Pac, Fuck Percy
I put him in a hearst where the dirt be
I'm blood thristy, 42 shots like James Worthy
These lames in the game aint worthy to touch meals, Ya heard me
I bust 30 in your P. Miller ?? jersey
The Dirty Dirty is better off without you
Double X-L (XXL) doubt you, Wrote a fucked up ad about you
Cause you wack as fuck, You need to let ya kids bust
Quit fuckin' off ya brothers careers and give that shit up
Mini me nigga wanna be somebody else
Rappin' like ya Tupac, Can't be yaself
That'll get you shot, Better be somebody else
Everybody on No Limit sound like somebody else
You got a nigga that sound like Dru (Down), A nigga like Mystikal
A white boy like Eminem, The bitin' is critical
Ya son wanna be Bow Wow, The shit is pitiful
What a bitch nigga would do for a hundred mil' or two
Fuck off his niggaz too, Cali aint feelin' you
I bet C-Murder locked up thinkin' bout killin' you
Nigga, Rap-A-Lot Mafia we get the scrilla too
Roll with a thousand niggaz too, You bitin' ass nigga you

(Chorus)
[Benjilino]
Somebody gonna die tonight
Get all of my niggaz, time to ride tonight
Disrespect a killa and them bullets gonna fly tonight
A nigga gonna die tonight</pre>
