[Chorus: Lil' Flip]
[They call him Lil' Flip]
who was the one that had ya'll leanin to the left?
[They call him Lil' Flip]
who got the hottest rap album on the shelf?
[They call him Lil' Flip]
who went platinum with one video?
[They call him Lil' Flip]
who smokin dro in every state he go?
[They call him Lil' Flip]
who made the world say 'I can do dat'?
[They call him Lil' Flip]
I'm ridin spinners on my Cadillac
[They call him Lil' Flip]
who got everybody wearin yellow diamonds?
[They call him Lil' Flip]
I ain't Baby but you know I'm big tymin'

[Verse 1: Lil' Flip]
Me and Greg Street ridin'in a red Jeep
we doing one-fifty nigga I bet you can't catch me
you gon' respect me-my glock nine protect me
I'm the one on 'How I'm Livin' with the candy Jetski
elevators in my crib, Burberry in my car
fire dro' by the jar, burn rubber on the tar
I like to show off-I use to be the class clown
but my teacher always said "Flip sit you're ass down"
"or you can leave the class now" so I left and got paid
but don't get it twisted I made straight A's
but school didn't pay so I started to rap
'Cause I wanna ride rims, I don't want no hub-caps
so I picked up my pen but I really don't need it
if I ain't in the magazine then I really want read it
I can't be defeated cause I'm workin too hard
"oh my gosh, that boy rims still spinnin on his car"

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil' Flip]
I get respect on the East, I get respect on the West
got plenty jewels on my neck, got 22's on my Lex
I'm 22 years old with 22 bad hoes
cause real playas get chose if you don't know, now ya know
you know I got crazy flow, and I make crazy dough
'Cause whenever I'm shoppin I make e'm close down the sto' (store)
you know we ballin for real nigga I'm tellin the truth
so if I ever go broke, sorry I'm sellin the Coupe
but that ain't gonna happen-cause I'm a keep on rappin
and if I keep on grindin, I'm a keep goin platinum
so people think I'm cappin but I'm just livin my life
'Cause I married the streets dogg and that's my wife

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil' Flip]
So that's me and everything gotta feed
I should be payin'rent cause I live on BET (They call him Lil' Flip)
yep, yep that's my other nickname
(Daaaaammmnnn!) Yep that's my other big chain (They call him Lil' Flip)
I'm in the Hummer you ain't ready for my whip game
rims so big my adapters won't fit mayne
look at my kicks mayne all of e'm custom
I gotta make it cause I can't go back to hustlin'
I'm focused man with no distractions
I'm multiplying money nigga, no subtraction
just relaxing and livin'it up
nigga you ain't no pimp so give me that cup

[Chorus: Lil' Flip]</pre>
