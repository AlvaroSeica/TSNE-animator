[Chorus] {2X}
It goes shrug these shoulders
What did I do wrong
Give em' a blank face
What did I do wrong
Where did we go wrong
What did I do wrong 
Well I dunno but I still say sorry though

[Verse 1]
Been tryn'a get a job for six months long
and it's wearing thin just try'na stay strong
Wanna wear it in, that suit walk based upon that
Peter Jackson fasion to move along
So you alter any faults in ya resume 
Outline any attributes your willing to demonstrate
With a keen attitude you include a heavyweight
Stretched of your so called skill, checked a better place
The chances, after all no phone calls nor answers
50 cover letters and still no answers 
You need to raise the standard to get what you demanding
Few days in a lewd then away with an interview
You hit back with that pitiful tone and you already know
"Sorry but we hired someone and they're better than you
They were more qualified, thanks for applying with our institute" (what..)

[Chorus] {2X}

[Verse 2]
Well a slow stroll making my way home
Cops on patrol I'm under my own, steady role 
Not that far to go, they go 
"hows it going mate" while they wind down the window
Info required knowing ID's desired
I'm quick to foster these pockts to find it, I find it
Pass it to the boys in blue, the annoying crew
Surely they got more to do
My point of view says tell em' to fuck off
I ain't really in the mood for these corrupt cops
Wanna cut loose but I let em' bust chops
Exchange some hate ain't really any love lost
Won't catch me smiling for the cameras mug shot
It's just one of those things I spose
Maybe it's my face, my clothes, my shaven head or my overgrowth
Either way I'll wait as time froze
20 minutes later and they let me go 
about 10 metres and I'm up the road
and I yell out a "FUCK you" just to let em' know 
(Your so fucking tough Muph)
Yeh well, fucking oath!

[Chorus] {2X}

[Verse 3]
What, she's got that look in her eye
like she can't identify with my implied vibe
And she's probably right try'na pick up on a lie
I don't understand why she doesn't realise
I'm not that type of guy, really
You can believe it I'm faithful, grateful
and I'm not that conceited but I am a defeatist who needs it all explained
So you better take off that scowl before the wind change
and in came the gush she doesn't wanna open up
Can't quite rip the trust within the Muph
It's really quite simple enough just tell me what I did
and I'll store it where all the rest of my knowledge is
We only just met yet your tryin to play the locksmith
Please, I'ma need a key to see what I did wrong

[Chorus] {2X}

Muph fucked up
What did I do wrong
Muphed up, fucked up
(ohhhhh shit) 
What did I do wrong
Well I dunno but I still say sorry though</pre>
