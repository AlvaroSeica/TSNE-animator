Song:   I'm So Wack
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm so wack, I'm so wack, I'm so wack
Niggas say I'm wack
But I don't give a fuck!
If I'm so wack then why you're on my nuts?
I'm so wack I say it all day!
Everytime you call me wack, nigga I get paid!
I'm so wack, I'm on your blog every morning
Tom ford suit 'cause me so corny
I'm so wack that bitches wanna bone me
Wax museum, niggas wanna clone me
Why am I, why am I wack?
Maybe it's, maybe it's my maybach!
Or could it be every piece that I hit back
When I was g-I-g-o-l-o-I-n-g to the max!
I'm so wack!
A DJ for the president
And when they come back I make that old rap irrelevant!
I'm so wack, and everything that I do
But ain't never done it, so what that make you?

[Chorus]
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!
So wicked, wicked wack!
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!

You can call me wack, but your words don't matter
I got more money than nerds got data!
Made my hot bitch, best believe I had her
Nigga is nothing, his spanish is nothing!
My english fucked up, who cares about grammar?
You can ask kelsey, your friend is grammar!
Oh, oh, oh my speakers go on hammer
You can touch this, nigga I'm a dancer!
Hockey is so fat, had to change my pants off
Why am I, why am I, why am I?
Blame it on my momma, cause I'm so handsome
Riot in delta l.a. to atlanta
Higher in shits, smoking hannah montana!
Cause they never get the picture, can't work their camera
All up on my twitter, hating on my status
I just laugh, fuck..
Push this wack... to this wack as blank!

[Chorus]
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!
So wicked, wicked wack!
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!

I'm so wack can't rap that all
Just staying on track and grab my balls
If whak was wrong, then what's the fault
Now I'm so whak and you're so wrong!
I'm so whack I gotta check my..
Maybe you get low, and you don't know
Baby I'm so wack I'm on chemical!

[Chorus]
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!
So wicked, wicked wack!
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!
I'm so wack!</pre>
