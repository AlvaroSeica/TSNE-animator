[Verse 1]
Guess who's back fuckers?  Roll that weed up
Engineer, please turn the goddamn beat up
Cats' ridin' tails on your man's tuxeda'
Yo I sonned a hundred rappers but I ain't gon' feed ya'
This my new shit, I'm back in business
If you didn't get this you're on my shitlist
I'm at your doormat like Jehova's Witness
With Balboa's gloves read' to go the distance
Fly Pig up in this, haters are nervous
Thinkin' I'ma say their little name in my verses
I ain't a maniac though, I'm a man with a purpose
If I shitted on somebody then they prolly deserved it
Bags of that purp' shit, OG Kush
Tell your friends about them yo but this the "shush"
This rap shit?  No more beatin' 'round the bush
I'm the new Jesse Jacks', operation PUSH

[Hook]
Brand new Nikes on, brand new hat 
Fresh out your bitch with a brand new rap
Knock Knock motherfucker, guess who's back?
With some shit for your ass, where the fuck y'all at?

[Verse 2]
These girls like "You're such a fuckin' asshole Matt!"
'Cause I'm with the next chicken in eleven minutes flat
Fans give me dap then I sign an autograph
Sayin' "Thanks for the support, one love" and all that
Some cats hang around smokin' my cigarettes n'
Stressin' me out askin' all sorts of question
They wanna know the secrets of my magic like Kreskin
Like I'm gonna break down now and start confessin'
Here's a question people ask a lot:
"How you write your rhymes?  You wanna rap?  Then watch
I smoke massive blocks of hash and pot
'Til I float through space like an astronaut
Then I scribble on the page and the track his hot
Then I wave on the haters like a traffic cop
And mr. show-promoter better have my gwap
I'm a motherfucker, just like my bastard Pops

[Hook 2]
Brand new nikes on, brand new hat
Fresh out the booth with a brand new track
That's right motherfucker guess who's back?
With some shit for your ass, where the fuck y'all at?

[Verse 3]
Everybody talking' 'bout your boy ain't right
'Cause I cross out tags in the broad daylight
I built my name out of bricks not hype
Respect the architect, Frank Lloyd Wright
My first two shits', had hits accidentally
Moonshine, two-times as strong as your Hennessey
Mixtape, sick straight through to the endin' G
2707, crime of the century
Mention me in the tale of this town
Bring some motherfuckers if you comin' for this crown
Swim with the big fish, you bound to drizz-own
Middle finger up, never turn my shit down
I'll get down 'til I'm up in a cage
Got paid, no one's seen me in a couple of days
Puffin' haze, cuffin' strays, son I'm stuck in my ways
Ain't dumb in brains, I'm just too fuckin' stubborn to change</pre>
