Let us begin by killin comparisons
Our differences are so glaring it's the point where it's embarrassin'
To be in the same class ya'll act hella scary
All flaming and flaring
Emotional and caring
Nope
We not on the same level at all
I'm more better and pure
And ya'll never before or after
Wil match my ability to kill it
I'm spittin a tyrant flow to take over your village
Cuz ya'll turn to women
The minute you not winnin
Start whining and bitchin
Stop handling business
And there lies the difference
Homie we not children
I get grown and handle my own without feelings
Cold Chillin at the top of the pile
So I rock with the Nile
And flow opposite you jockin the style
Takin notes straight jottin it down
There's no stopping me now
I put the dough to the pocket and smile
So Supreme

(Chorus)
Yeah I'm here now
And I'll e here later
But you'll be gone then
And I'll be here hater
(Busta Rhymes Sample)
I feel so supreme, I feel so supreme
I feel so supreme, I feel so supreme
You was there then
But you aint here now
And I was there then
And yeah I'm still around
(Busta Rhymes Sample)
I feel so supreme, I feel so supreme
I feel so supreme, I feel so supreme

Nigga,
Popularity's for little girls
I'm on a flight rockin shows all across the world
Exchange foreign currency see the sights
Double up and head home to play bones with my nigga Darryl
I aint gotta explain my reasons for anything
I simply do my thing on beats
In my own lab, you fill in the blanks
Give thanks for my presence and I make checks to spill in the bank
I'm on my grind steadily
Nigga you better be smarter
Get your publishing up to mess with me
Little dude we aint on in the same
I aint runnin for fame
I aint runnin with ya'll
Ya'll wanna run in the game
I'm tryin' to ball off the court
Give a fuck what you say
I make solid moves now being lucky can pay
Only once or twice
I'm getting cash for the rest of my days
Fuck being the best in LA
So Supreme

(Chorus)
Yeah I'm here now
And I'll e here later
But you'll be gone then
And I'll be here hater
(Busta Rhymes Sample)
I feel so supreme, I feel so supreme
I feel so supreme, I feel so supreme
You was there then
But you aint here now
And I was there then
And yeah I'm still around
(Busta Rhymes Sample)
I feel so supreme, I feel so supreme
I feel so supreme, I feel so supreme

You in the spot with a crew that brown nose and butt-kiss
I fell up in the jam with niggas I grew up with
Real family, raw but still flamby
Plan A conquer the globe, no plan b
And since life aint a playground I stay down
Spend cash wise to ensure I stay round
For the long term
A lesson I had to learn
Whether you with me or not aint my damn concern
I'ma, Snake Charmer where the phonies and the fake wander
I ruff the rugged terrain
That ya'll aint fond of
Real champion ya'll niggas is Jane Fonda
Ya'll fake niggas wont escape Karma
So Supreme</pre>
