[Chorus]
We Da'
High Ridaz
Holdin mad green
Got our pocket and pipes filled
ya know what I mean

You know the
High Ridaz
D-loc and Johnny Richt
step in any session
You know we'll end it quick

Who's a
High rida
who's down with a squad
Who's down to smoke an ounce
they go chill at the bar

If you a
High Rida
Throw em up real high
Put your drinks in the air
Raise your joints in the sky

[Loc]
Back in the day when I was young growin up
I always toked buds and I never gave a fuck
Rolled around in a bug always had my pants saggin
Sold a little weed and had a spray can for taggin
But now day's have changed I've rearranged my whole scene
I've made a little cash bought a house with my green
I still sag my pants, smoke a lot more weed
I stopped taggin -sshhhshshhhs- ya kno what I mean?
We da'
High Ridaz
always down to smoke
My homie Johnny Richter and the mothafuckin D-loc
We ain't no joke
We be blazin up the weed
Dazin people in the industry
blazin up the scene Kingspade, thats the brand new clique
D-loc and Johnny Richter on some real ill shit
We ain't fakin'
so fuck fakers and liars
Fuck every hater
cuz we
the High Ridaz

[Chorus]
We Da'
High Ridaz
Holdin mad green
Got our pockets and pipes filled
ya know what I mean

You know the
High Ridaz
D-loc and Johnny Richt
step in any session
You know we'll end it quick

Who's a
High rida
who's down with a squad
Who's down to smoke an ounce
then go chill at the bar

If you a
High Rida
Throw em up real high
Put your drinks in the air
Raise your joints in the sky

[Richter]
Take it back to the days
when I was just a young scrub
Growin up in the game
of slangin' bud
Roll around my town utilizing backstreets
cuz I always had a pound in my backseats
See I'm a, High rida, since about '92
I got my start buyin Q's of this dude named Lou
Now I'm slangin lyrically puttin joints on beat
Smoke on stages like I'm smokin on the Hindusply* ?!
Cruzin' up and down ya blocks we got this shit on lock
D-loc and Johnny Richter, we on fire, we Hot
Watchin jaws drop as soon as we step into the room
Causin' quakes fuck we hittin you with sonic Booms
My tomb will say
He went out in a blaze
Puffin bowls of green crack mixed with purple haze
Cuz in my last days I'm gonna be stoned as fuck
drunk as a skunk
gettin head from your girl, Whats up?

[Chorus]
We Da'
High Ridaz
Holdin mad green
Got our pockets and pipes filled
ya know what I mean

You know the
High Ridaz
D-loc and Johnny Richt
step in any session
You know we'll end it quick

Who's a
High rida
who's down with a squad
Who's down to smoke an ounce
then go chill at the bar

If you a
High Rida
Throw em up real high
Put your drinks in the air
Raise your joints in the sky</pre>
