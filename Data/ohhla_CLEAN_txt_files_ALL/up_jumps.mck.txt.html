[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I
I say up jumps da boogie and boogie jumps the beat
me and my niggas keep pumps and we run the beef
we ain't scared we eat it
niggas be like when it's beef time them boys that cheating
I leak your shit leaking like a new cd or a new album
get the fuck out the line of fire that's what I tell 'em
shit I paint a nigga shit red
you don't want it to look like a nigga dodged your head
who the fuck would wanna test ya young money clicker
young money family moneys what we're granting
shit you niggas don't want it with none of us
from the smallest to the biggest
black be pop pills the way we bicking
the graveyard people'll start digging
your hearts what we're shipping to your mama
In the midst of the drama
I'm a nigga that never pause like it's a comma
I'm a nigga that'll eat you alive like donna jeffery
now let me explain why them niggas lefty
crazy man alone up in the zone
cause when I shoot I don't even see faces
now your moms looking for a son replacement
up jumps da boohie and jiggie jumps the beat
we keep pumps and we quick to run the beef
ha I don't think you wanna test young money
you fuck around and you get left with a see through tummy
I say up jumps da boogie and boogie jumps the beat
