(L-Burna) 
It's all about perfect timin', feel me! 
I said, it's all about perfect timin', feel me! 
Nigga, it's all about perfect timin', feel me! 
Puttin' it down 'til these mothafuckas kill me! 

(Ken Dawg) &amp; L-Burna x4 
(It's like, time will tell, time will tell) 
For me to prevail and capitalize on this mail 
Look at the seven on my stomach, don't run from it 
Battles you scared of a nigga that done really done it 

(L-Burna) 
Nigga, this hustlin' thang ain't knew to me 
See, what it do for me 
I keeps it crackin' and poppin', and droppin' 
The fact this shit that's always chart toppin' 
Feelin' my legacy, don't step to me never 
Nigga done took you on that other level 
I war with the devil just one of them mighty rebels 
I passed the game out, figured a way to get my name out 
Now they ask me what this fame 'bout 
Little kids wanna go the same route 
If they can be like lil' Layzie they would 
But it's thug or die comin' up in the hood 
It's all the same, homie
from the north, to the south, to the east, to the west 
Better protect that chest and keep it peacefull where you rest 
And God bless 
If I have to protect my family I will 
May Lord have mercy on your soul when it's the time to kill 
Let time reveal 
And I bet they tell a story is at 
And I put my city on the map 
Nigga, I attack with rap 
World wide thugish ruggish, ruggish, riggish, ruggish, ruggish, ruggish 
World wide thugish ruggish, ruggish, riggish, ruggish, ruggish, ruggish

(It's like, time will tell, time will tell) 
For me to prevail and capitalize on this mail 
Look at the seven on my stomach, don't run from it 
Battles you scared of a nigga that done really done it 

(L-Burna) 
Nigga, tick tock 
On a race against the clock, we all swervin' 
When i'm dippin' in my Suburban 
I be that nigga that pull to the curb 
And I got some words for y'all niggas that's claimin' you're holdin' it down 
What's wrong wit'cha now, when I come around niggas hatin' me now 
I already knew it wasn't my niggas 
It was that money that kept you blinded 
I'm masterminded, perfect timin' 
Keepin' my mental criminal minded 
Want an autograph, and I signed it 
Showed you much love, and I meant it 
Now i'm doin' this eternal sin to stand away from you and hatred 
Fuck the world 
Nigga, I'd die for respect 
Nigga, I ride for my check 
And i'm just waitin' to see who gon' lie to me next 
So what, that rolex on your wrist 
Won't mean you always on point 
All that flossin'll get you held up 
Ask my niggas in the joint 
Doin' time'll put some shit on your mind 
Nothin' but solitude, niggas ain't got no gratitude 
Real niggas that keep that attitudes 
World wide thugish ruggish, ruggish, riggish, ruggish, ruggish, ruggish 
World wide thugish ruggish, ruggish, riggish, ruggish, ruggish, ruggish

Nigga, I don't switch my block 
Cause it's still double glock 
Even tho' i'm runnin' from the cops 
World wide, I gets my props 

(Dekumpoze) 
You the man little nigga 
You ain't knowin' that shit? 
And i'ma put it down for you 
So go on and wreck 

(L-Burna) 
Well, I'ma disect this shit 
Strip it down to the nerve 
Pull the Excersion to the curb 
And let these niggas know the word 

(Dekumpoze) 
Well, the word is 
Nigga, it's your time to shine 
Bottom line, hatin' niggas can't stop the grind 

(L-Burna) 
Wussup! 
Nigga, y'all niggas ain't ready to blow 
Dekumpoze, lil' Layzie Bone from a nation unknown 

(Dekumpoze) 
Bone Thugs my niggas 
The original heavy hitters of a show 
Go-getters, and L Burna, wig splitter 

(Layzie Bone) 
Take a picture, nigga 
We'll get'cha, it's the thangs we do 
It's just the game that we be spittin', let me explain it to you 

(Dekumpoze) 
And i'm gon' be that nigga that tell ya to go on and give 'em hell too 
The team in the cells, only time will tell
