[Intro - Akrobatik - talking] - w/ ad libs
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me turn my headphones up, be right back
Yo, The Perceptionists
Yo, yeah, The Perceptionists
Word, that shit is crankin now
That shit is crankin now
That shit is crankin now
Come on!

[Chorus - Akrobatik]
Just nod your head to the beat
Come on and just nod your head to the beat (what?)
You got to just nod your head to the beat (come on)
Everybody nod your head to the beat (what? what? what? ...)
Or maybe throw your hands in the air to the beat (one time)
Come on and throw your hands in the air to the beat
Everybody throw your hands in the air to the beat (put 'em up!)
Come on, throw your hands in the air to the beat (yo, let's go!)

[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
Soon as the record start spinnin, I'm winnin and beginning to please crowds
With flows that leave clouds 
Lookin up (lookin up), rap's number one spot is tooken up (tooken up)
By this underground kid that got the industry shooken up (no doubt)
Cats bookin up Ak for the free for all (all)
Reefer leakin through the walls (walls), let me leave a free for y'all
Leave it all behind, your trials and tribulations (tribulations)
Ak attack, niggaz need defibrillation (defibrillation)
Used to seein hip-hop in disintegration
Keep this in rotation, I'm gettin impatient
'Cause (uh huh), the hot shit's right under your nose (nose)
Like Don Corleone spittin thunderous blows (blows, yeah)
And I'll be 44 with the wonderous flows (flows)
I'm wildin out in case the day they call my number is close (close)
Low post brother like Hakeem Olajuwon (what?)
Rap without Ak is like Ramadan
A temporary fast but you know I'm comin back to feed your lyrical need
You'll ear it'll bleed
When I, fuck your head up at the sound setup (HA!)
If you get beat down, get up (yeah)
Call it a comeback, Akrobatik murder the drum tracks
Grimy like the city that I'm from black
Yo, Ak be nimble, Ak be quick
And I'm back to kick that old classic shit
Ain't no asterisk, I done mastered this
It's disastrous if y'all have to flow after this
(after this, after this, after this, after this ...)

Come on man

[Chorus - Akrobatik] - w/ ad libs
Now just nod your head to the beat
Come on and just nod your head to the beat
Everybody nod your head to the beat
You got to just nod your head to the beat
Or maybe throw your hands in the air to the beat (come on)
Come on and throw your hands in the air to the beat (come on)
Yeah, throw your hands in the air to the beat (throw 'em up!)
Everybody throw your hands in the air to the beat (one time!)

[Break #1 - Akrobatik - talking] - w/ ad libs
That shit is crankin now
That shit is, uh, that shit is crankin now
Yeah, that shit is crankin now
That shit is, that shit is crankin now

[Break #2 - Akrobatik - talking] - w/ cuts by DJ Therapy
My man Therapy's on the wheels
Yeah, my man Therapy's on the wheels
Yo, my man Therapy's on the wheels
With the beatbox by my man Baba Israel
Come on!

[Chorus - Akrobatik]
Come on and just nod your head to the beat
You got to just nod your head to the beat
Come on and just nod your head to the beat
Somebody just nod your head to the beat (come on!)
Or maybe throw your hands in the air to the beat
Come on and throw your hands in the air to the beat
Everybody throw your hands in the air to the beat
Come on and throw your hands in the air to the beat (one time!)
