[Chorus]
Your hard times produce perseverance
Which produces character, which leads to hope
Peep the whole scope of the matter
Ya brains the mainframe that stores the data
Then instant recall when flaming daggers
Are thrown in your path, your faith in God makes you laugh
Check the equation, you did the math
All I'm trying to say is don't let hard times get in your way
Cause God has a plan from yesterday to today

[Verse 1]
I realize the trouble I face, is like running a race for the grand prize, Steady my pace
Clap my hand and pray for guidance
Open the word verse to verse I do the science
Trust in God's word and never in man's defiance
Cause my alliance is with the messiah
Israel child parted from Egypt by the fire of the Bible
In the Red Sea laying all of my rivals
Cause killing God's children could flip to be suicidal
Ya follow ill hearted, got hit by tidal's
Never follow God unless your intentions is bridal
Now I see why I came up so rough, why I be street tough
Only twice got snuffed, God had a plan from beginning to end
Genesis to Revelation, he knew my destination
Like when you come home from priz, there be a celebration
I went from hell's burning world, to God's golden nation, a standing ovation
From the saint's, but still on my face is war paint
Cause the devil thought he had me locked down in his chains
So everyday he test me, try to mind arrest me
Break me and bend me, but Christ is living in me
And he has to flee in Jesus name, bounce baby
Christ opened my vision, when my eyes were scaly
So I praise him daily, my belief is rock solid
I build my house upon the rock, when the winds are torrid
Or just a nice day at the beach, I'm in his everlasting love and peace
So I extend my reach, to touch the hem of his garment
The lone tree in the thick of the forest
My roots be planted in holy waters

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Jehovah-Nissi, with my hands raised you can't defeat me
I praise my way into a battle, you snakes get rattled
I been there before so now I'm ready for war
And with God given orders, I'm kickin' down doors
And sealing one, that's detrimental, I'm instrumental
A tool for Christ so son who sent you, his words essential
To fight the Amelkites annually, battles forever
Different seasons different weather, like tees to leathers
Supreme Being be the never seen, my faith will never swing
Like a pendulum, I'm maxin' out, I felt the minimum
When I was sinnin', now I'm like a new revision
The next chapter finally free from Satan's prison
The world, steadily taking our boys and girls
The world, turning to coal what was a pearl
The world, praising certain men like walking God's
The world, until it's all even, they'll be at odds
So I'm a member of the body of Christ, we not equal in life
But equal in God's sight, lets get tight
With the master, before disaster strikes
And you leave this world faster than flights, from LaGuardia
Forgotten like Somalia, let God be ya guardian
Wrap you in love like a cardigan

[Chorus]</pre>
