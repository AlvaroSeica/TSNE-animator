Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Girl I'm the flyest, okay, okay
Why don't you try it? ice cream, ice cream! [x2]
You got it, it's the ice cream song
Yeah bitch it's the ice cream song!

Yeah ma it's the ice cream song
And I fucks with cookies and cream all day long
When I get up in her pants she got them tight jeans on
And she know I like that, so she come right back
Girl on the beat, I'm coming with the heat
The Pack and the Fed taking over the streets
And from these bitches, I serve them ice cream Strawberry, Caramel, this bitch got cream

She got cream, so you know that I'm a fiend
And the Fed got Knoc being part of the team
Like it when she get freaky, start raising whipped creams
Little mama, she got it, she got it

Gimme that shit, and the wriggle on rims
Plus it with my nigga tim, got ice cream?
I got a banana for your split, drip and drop some on top
You got ice cream show me what you got

Girl I'm the flyest, okay, okay
Why don't you try it, ice cream, ice cream! [x2]
(Yes) You got it, it's the ice cream song
Yeah bitch it's the ice cream song!

Vanilla, chocolate, assorted flavours
With ice cream girl, you can hop in my scraper
Flossy head, suction dome
I want my ice cream on the cone
Give it to me now, give it to me frozen
I'm the flyest don't you know this
Thirty one flavours in between
Basket Robin ice cream

Okay, (okay), okay, (okay), it's the ice cream song
Sweet sweet, like yum yum, nestle, in bubblegum
Tongue rings and dumb freaks, free pimp like Bun B
Okay, she's eating, candy, she's leaking
Juices like Kool-Aid, candy it's candy!

Girl I'm the flyest, okay, okay
Why don't you try it, ice cream, ice cream! [x2]
You got it, it's the ice cream song
(You got it) Yeah bitch it's the ice cream song!

Eat it, lick it like a sundae cone
Watch yourself for trip I'm grown
Look ya'll, I'm hating, popsicles refrigerating
Ooh man, dumb cream got me coming back like
[? ]

Girl I'm the flyest, okay, okay
Why don't you try it, ice cream, ice cream! [x2]
You got it, it's the ice cream song
(You got it) Yeah bitch it's the ice cream song!</pre>
