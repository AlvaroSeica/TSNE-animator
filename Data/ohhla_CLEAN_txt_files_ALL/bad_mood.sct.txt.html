[Intro]
I just have one question...

[Travis Scott]
Fuck outta my business
I done things that most men would ask forgiveness
Broke the code, the commandments from my descendants
Gives a fuck, new children in the buildin'
We ride with no limits
Shut the fuck up, don't you hear me tryna finish?
I'm in a bad mood {*echoes*}

[Travis Scott]
Rob that dude
Fuck that couch, burn that house
We the cause of the era, you niggas we're new terror
A thousand on the leather, you niggas should know better
Some niggas new slaves, I do say (fuck, fuck)
Twice only on a Tuesday when I'm in a bad mood
Oooh, your skin mahogany (fuck, fuck)
Oooh, let's break the monotony
Government threw us in a maze (WHAAAT)
Have you trickin' forty K for some grades (WHAAAT)
Just to make forty K for the wage
Dropped out and made that in one day
I'm in a bad mood {*echoes*}

[Travis Scott]
Ooh nigga I'm wildin' on 'em
Hmm, back pilling on 'em
I never feel the pain
Only God can make it rain
So I must be Mary, Joseph, Allah
Kid of a disciple, these thoughts is suicidal
Jumpin' off a buildin', quit thinkin' like a psycho
They tryna find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty
Anxiety, under the meds, Chris Bobby, AAAHH!

[Travis Scott]
Skinny black bastard ridin' Casper
I tend to lose my thoughts when I walk
They say I'm a slave so tell me the master
Now his head on the pendant by the cross
Coke'd it then I fucked her for the theory
You know I'm crazy, I'm straight, no weary
I hate when conversates can't relate
You know it be fucking up my groove when I'm in a bad mood {*echoes*}</pre>
