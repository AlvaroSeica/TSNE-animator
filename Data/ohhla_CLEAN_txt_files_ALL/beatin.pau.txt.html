{Verse 1: Lord Infamous}
Sometimes I be wantin to take my fist and beat these bitches badly
Check them tramps, I neva nap cause Scarecrow gotta have the
Dividens, theres plenty ends for managin those prostitutes
Kickin that black bitch in her big end so hard that she pickin the skin up
off my boots
My brother has always said dont have no mercy on these hoes
Make them walk the strip until they wearin out they shoe soles
And ever since then I cant stand to see a bitch with a dollar
It mess me up that funky bitch cause I'll a
Bitch you got to work, go to work, Do some dirt
Bring Lord Infamous back some money before you get yo ass hurt
Bitch, You betta meet yo fuckin quota
Bitch you betta wise up
Fuck around and get yo ass put in the piledriver
Busta mother fucka pain hennessey across ya fuckin head
Hit you in the knee cap with a pipe and try to break yo leg
Man there's plenty money to be made In the M-Town
Niggaz betta learn you gotta beat a funky bitch down

[Chorus]

{Verse 2: Lord Infamous}
One day me and Paul was chillin in the cut dog, jus glidin
A couplea bitches I knew ask for a ride
We just cruisin, jus a little pimpin
Rollin blunts and bumpin
Paul ask the bitch you wanna hit the hotel or something?
The hoes were with it so we fell up in the La Corta
And we smokin mega blunts and sippin on that grape fruit Gin
Now the bitches fucked up and the Scarecrow spittin crazy game
Paul in the corner gettin his dick sucked by the otha dame
Now I got the stallion comin on up out them draws
Oh lord now its type to bang the walls, bang the walls
Now we through but I still think the hoes dont get the picture
Fired up the roach and hit the rest of the liquor
(So whats up where you want us to drop you off to?)
Next thing I know she comin out her purse with a deuce, deuce
I started bustin, with the 80 out the ankle holster
Two wounded bitches in the hotel fuckin with LoCstaz

[Chorus]</pre>
