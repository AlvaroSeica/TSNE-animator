Verse 1

Let me drop down about 40 Stories
I'm a big shot, like Robert Horry
Fuck your hate, your pretend to threat on the internet
ya pranking my phone saying ya break in my home
like I don't roam with them goons with the chromes
Come on man
I'll put some cheese on your head like a packer fan
matter fact, I'm getting more head than a catscan
turn around, get your back up plan
I'm a quarter key, fuck you half a grams
It's Determined, Michael Barber
I'm Determined, Michael Barber
I'll Louisville Slugga a motherfucker
I induce pain
Ill put that beat to your chest like Bruce Wayne
and fuck these rappers
I'm still playing that wu tangÂ…

Verse 2

Im the king the greatest, the next cassius clay
I'm making moves, y'all just passing days
I know y'all heard of me
all up in the cut like surgery
im respected so expect it
or ya gonna get beat like a step kid
it's slim with the tilted brim on the fitted
alligator on the knitted
I'm fresher than a peppermint
all I do is represent
and lately I've been loving the hate
cause that means that lately, you've been playing my tapes</pre>
