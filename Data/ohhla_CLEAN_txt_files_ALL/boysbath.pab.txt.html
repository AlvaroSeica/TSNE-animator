[Intro: Petey Pablo]
Put one in there for me last time
For my country ass
COME ON!

[Chorus One]
Meet me in the boy's bathroom, COME ON!
Meet me in the boy's bathroom, COME ON!
Meet me in the boy's bathroom, COME ON!
(What you wanna do with all these girls?) COME ON!
Meet me in the boy's bathroom, NOW COME ON!
Meet me in the boy's bathroom, NOW COME ON, RAHHH!

[Petey Pablo]
That boy that love to rock
Man I hold more songs then a goddamn jukebox
That nigga like 2Pac 
130 songs in one day, don't stop
That boy gon' hurt somethin 
When he come out this time watch them numbers
Five.. ten.. fifteen
While the money keep pilin up
Had to get another money machine
cause the first one I had don't work no more
Had to get me some new cars
with new rims and chrome bars
Kinda glad that they made things cool
with a button in the middle, I miss my aunt-aunt
Like I miss my grandma
With a Crisco can on the back of the stove
'Bout to fry me up some catfish
With a side of ocra 
Y'all ready to have some fun? (yeah!)
With the helicopter back of the club (yeah!)
I got that what they want (yeah!)
They want that bumpty-bump (yeah!)
I know that nigga shit hot right now dawg
But this shit here cold

[Chorus One] w/ minor variation

[Petey Pablo]
(Big bird) Big bird got a new flock
That won't fly South, they soarin to the next block
We park our cars in the place in the space
where the sign says ain't no park
If I come outside and they boot my tire (so?)
I just Snoop Dogg drive it (Snoop Dogg!)
Three wheels on one side
Hard knocks, crank the nine
With a Carolina baseball hat pulled down
so the sun don't go in my eyes
We the type of guys
The guys that daddy don't like
With that old colonge that they used to wear
comin in here smellin just like
My head is fast as lightning
His daughter's apple's ripe!
Just reach up there and pulled one down
and mmm, I just bite it!
What you doin in there with the lights off?
Y'all get in this livin room right now!
I wish he take his ass
to a muh'fuckin bingo zone now (bingo!)
He's just mad cause mines is bad
and he forgot where he put his Viagra (hey!)

{"I bet you thought the record was over, didn't you?"}

{*beat changes*}

[Chorus Two]
Meet me in the boy's bathroom! (I said)
Meet me in the boy's bathroom! (I said, I said, I said)
Meet me in the boy's bathroom! (I said, I said, I said!)
Now what am I gon' do with all these girls, girls? (Heyyyyy!)

[Petey Pablo]
Hoochie, coochie, ya-ya fool
Put yo' hands on the back of that stool
Uh-uh, you best not move
Stop actin like this ain't somethin you're used to
I've known you since high school
when they caught you in the gym behind the bleachers with a two dudes
Yo' name ring bells in the neighborhood
Best head in the whole wide world
Prettiest chest they ever gave to a woman
It almost make a nigga hate to even skeet on
I bet you'd ask next time 'fore ya ass drunk
Somewhere you ain't supposed to cum
And get tapped on 'til yo' lil' thang'll come
And your face swell up like it's busted open
I told you, this bop got a whole lotta bump
Now get on outta here

[Chorus Two]</pre>
