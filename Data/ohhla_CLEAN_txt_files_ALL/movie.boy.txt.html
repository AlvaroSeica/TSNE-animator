Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, Ima show you how to do it for real
Yeah this ain't no game
That's on everything

Yeah it's Smooky
I always wanted to be in a movie [4x]

Lights, camera, action
I step on the scene
Lights, camera, action
I got on white jeans
Lights, camera, action
I step on the scene
Lights, camera, action
That's on everything

Yeah Smooky, Smooky
Ride around town wit yo girl, it's a movie
A movie, a movie
Put the camera on me
Oh my God I got all this jewelry on me
Swag turned up, I can't even put it down
Riding thru the city, yes I know you hear the sound
Smook this smook that, word around town
Oh my God my lamborghinis found
Zoom, yeah I'm gone
The king on my throne
Smook dawg smook dawg, done smook'd off
AK 47 dropped off, stashed off
In my stash house, by the last house
Yeah I always want to star
I always want to have the cameras posted on my car
I always want to know, who the hell they are
Hanging on the star, thats somethin that you aren't
I'm like

Yeah it's Smooky
I always wanted to be in a movie [4x]

Lights, camera, action
I step on the scene
Lights, camera, action
I got on white jeans
Lights, camera, action
I step on the scene
Lights, camera, action
That's on everything</pre>
