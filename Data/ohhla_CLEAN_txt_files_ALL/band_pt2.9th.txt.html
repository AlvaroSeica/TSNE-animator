[Intro: Phonte]
They ask me what I think about the competition
and I say, {*imitating Joe Namath*} "No...
I couldn't care less about the team strugg-a-ling... I wanna kiss you!"
New Tigallo, new Tigallo, new Tigallo!

[Phonte]
Yo, Tigallo and 9th Wonder, maybe
we got yo' girl ungulating, to the rhythm of the drum
Wet T-shirt lookin like a vacation
Take it off like Monday, baby!
And there will be no underrating
So please hold your applause, let it bump a little up in your cars
They say, "That boy's back!" Nigga, this is blackboard rap
You can go and caulk it up to a loss
and if you got a pro'lem with it, walk it up to the boss
and get your card pulled like Pitty Pat
Body a verse and put it in a pine box
You niggas can get a fuckin shine box, Billy Batts
And really, that's all my time, this is the last chapter
You X and Y, we off the damn axis
Intricate, me and 9th two of God's instruments
and when we get together, you can call it...

[Phonte + Median]
BAND PRACTICE

[Median]
Men of action, they hustle bass-ackwards
Penny for your thoughts kid, miss me with that rappin
+Sho'nuff+, I am like +the Master+
See the glow, what? Grown-up, I am that then
Heh, I empassion, two parts magic
Sprinkle then authentic, simmer with a little madness
Got a vendetta for the magistrate
Catch you in the world in playin clothes, ain't no tellin what'll happen
That would be entrapment, please 
The audacity and casualty of crassness
I am absent-minded, so I am past it
Fryin fish much bigger for the inquisitive Jurassic
Picture Moby Dick holidn a flick, don't miss it
May sank your ship, Ahab-idish
You need A-rab Benjamins with paying close attention to the mentionings
Act II have brought an instrument
FOr I always known, they were +Listening+

[Phonte]
This is the last chapter
You X and Y, we off the damn axis
Intricate, me and 9th two of God's instruments
and when we get together, you can call it band practice
Really, that's all my time, this is the last chapter
You X and Y, we off the damn axis
Intricate, me and 9th two of God's instruments
and when we get together, you can call it band practice</pre>
