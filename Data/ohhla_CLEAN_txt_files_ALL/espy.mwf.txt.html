Yo man these niggaz is straight wack
	YaknowhatI'msayin?
Yeah I know
	Can't take these thievin motherfuckers
About to bring this meeting to order, yaknowhatI'msayin?
	For real
Chill
	Yo, we gotta kill these niggaz
Chill

[Danja Mowf]
YO, what's this?
Meeting called in the Hall of Just-ice
It's been long overdue that we discuss THIS
Yes it's up to the SupaFriendz to crush THIS
clan; here's the plan: bust THIS
I need one man brave enough to touch THIS
to perform as my right hand and mush THIS
noise from boys that test (uh-huh)
So how do y'all suggest that we bring it to they chest?

[Kalonji]
Aiyyo Danja (whattup cuz?) You know the squad thick
But I'm sayin let's me and you take this on some espionage shit
and start eliminating wackness with disturbed Goldeneyes
(Oh you mean like some SupaFriendz spies?)

Ahhh, now you get it, let's get camouflage
So we can sabotage sucker MC's with espionage

[Danja Mowf]
Yeah, me and Kalonji, gettin camouflage
So we can sabotage sucker MC's with espionage

[Kalonji]
Alright look, I'm sketchin out the plans (uh-huh)
And drawing diagrams (uh-huh) with high tech equipment in the caravan
(aight) We hit the spot, the parking lot
of the nightclub where the open mic night is for them local scrubs
Sneaking through the back will security be hounding
We'll pound them and swiftly snuff out the sound men (true)
Disguised as the engineers, we amp the monitors
and headphones and shatter MC's and DJ's ears *breaking glass*
With dexterity bonafide (bonafide); we slide levels up
and blow heads off with audible cyanide
First we hide, then escape creepin (c'mon c'mon c'mon)
Reachin for the keys, we leavin with the tires screechin *peels out*

[Danja Mowf]
Me and Kalonji, gettin camouflage
So we can sabotage sucker MC's with espionage 

[Kalonji]
Me and Danja, gettin camouflage
So we can sabotage sucker MC's with espionage

[Danja Mowf]
Me and Kalonji, gettin camouflage
So we can sabotage sucker MC's with espionage

[Kalonji]
Me and Danja, gettin camouflage
So we can sabotage sucker MC's with espionage 

[Danja Mowf]
Yess, so now we change course (alright)
And take a full page advertisement in The Source (yea yea)
to make known to fake clones who got that booty flow
that we're givin free time in our brand new studio (hmmm)
We felt it was our duty though to spread it like a cootie so
we cast the bait and now we catchin more Fish than Hootie Blow
(Whaaat?) Rappers came browsin, the studio housin
Checkin out the MPC-3000 and the
shells of SP-12's (uh-huh); the buttons
had explosive triggers so them niggaz blew up they damn selves
And on the mic rappers drop clean; "Every Breath They Take"
inhaling cyanide from off the pop screen
It's not mean they deserve it (Why Danja?)
Cause they wack, shit
(Yo use the sound booth as a gas chamber)
Aight, whatever's clever, I'm ready and I'm willing
They won't catch us pass the matches
I'll burn the down the fucking building (hahahaha)

Yo, I'm sitting, in the backdrop
In the Beemer, with the blacktop *sounds of a keyboard*
I'm on the case, like Matlock
Pushing buttons, of a laptop
to tap into the mainframe computers down at BDS and SoundScan
Now your Billboard rating's going down man!

[Kalonji]
I'm a super computer hacker deciding wack rappers fates
Tapping into the booking agencies I'm changing all they tour dates
Somehow they end up in V-A playing the same room
(You push it) Nah you push it! (aight)....
