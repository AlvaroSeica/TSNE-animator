[Intro]
Funk... hehe, YEAH~!
Like, I don't really know what it is about her but
She makes me feel so fuckin special and
when she's here I'm alright but when she leaves I'm
Fuck it

[Travie McCoy]
And when I close my eyes, cause that's when she appears
I grab her by the thighs, and I pull her near
But to my surprise, it's just what I feared
Cause when I turn on the lights, there's no one there

[Chorus]
I'm by myself and I'm dancing all alone
I'm by myself and I know that nobody's solo
I'm by myself, but I'm dancing all alone
I'm by myself

{*scratched: "There's no one there - when I turn on the lights"*}

[Travie McCoy]
And just like that, she's right back
She'll stay the night, as long as I play the right track
She likes the lights low, and when she whinds slow
I'm buyin what she's sellin, ain't no tellin where my mind goes
She leaves my mind blown - like old speakers
She always comes and goes - but I never leave her
She's like my favorite cut {*scratch*} or replay
She makes the paper cuts go away I hope she stays

[Chorus] - 2X

{*scratched: "There's no one there - when I turn on the lights"*}

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
