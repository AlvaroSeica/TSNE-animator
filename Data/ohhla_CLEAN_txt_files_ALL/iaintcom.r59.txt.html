[Chorus: Royce - singing]
I'm floatin away without leavin the ground, ground
They askin me, "What's it like up there?"
I tell 'em "I ain't comin down"
I'm tryin to stay up and I don't wanna touch down, down
They askin me, "What's it like up there?"
I tell 'em "I ain't comin down"
Nope, no no, I ain't comin down (down)
No no, I ain't comin down (down)
No no, I ain't comin down (down)
I ain't, coming, down

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uhh, now that my vision's more clearer
This is for the hate on Royce in Detroit era
I know y'all had a good time but that was y'all time
But that was y'all error, now look at you and look at me
Compare us, you can do it easily
This ain't when Royce was lookin stupid on that "Beef" DVD
Uh-uh, shoutout my niggaz D-Twizzy
I'll admit when I was wrong
I remember thinkin I should probably hit my nigga Von
You talkin shit about me at your barbershop you obviously politickin wrong
Niggaz need to stop PMS'in
I hope y'all barbers give y'all ass the same hairline as me and DMX's
Haha, I went from wishin Trick-Trick was gone
From pickin which bitch to wishin I could TwitPic my home
And as far as my nigga Trick, before we was brothers
I think we really just needed to get to know each other
I'm up

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uhh, I gotta say this shit one time
When have you ever known me to get in the way of one's grind?
Cause even when that dark cloud hovered above me I went from signed to unsigned 
Then I found my own sunshine
Uhh, now let me say this shit one mo' time
When have you ever known me to get in the way of yo' grind?
Can you find one hip-hop listener around the globe
who don't know that Nickel Nine is from Motown?
These cats say "He's wack
He ain't even from the D so why he got that D tat?"
Then they friends run to me like my friends saw you cipherin on BET
but he ain't like it cause you ain't have on no D hat
Make up your mind you whinin niggaz
Ryan done been at schools to talk, bought shoes for shorties
Bought coats for the kids while you niggaz choose to floss
And y'all wanna nail who to the cross? Y'all niggaz soft
I'm up

[Chorus]</pre>
