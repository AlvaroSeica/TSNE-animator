[Entity - verse 1]
Who's the most vicious emcee spitting sickness over verses with ill techniques
My skill speaks, like drill seargeants
I kill squads, is when I spill the hardest
From here to August I'm an artist, far from modest
How many times I promise to harvest in your conscience
Talking shit, constant, 'till you tell me to stop it
In the cockpit I drop hits from here to Compton
I'll spit on your carpet, using the tip of a shotgun
I'm a monster when I got one, so put up your guard
Spit, but consider wit' caution when I beg your pardon
I'ma bug 'till I rock the garden
My cock is the size of an oxen, there's no option
I'ma steal oxygen from the planet, and sniff dust off of granite
Rocking a jacket, that lets me transmit, pages of a pamplet
That knocks bandits into plywood, they casket, you bastards

[Chorus]

[IQ - Verse 2]
I'm your area, I'll bury ya
Scarin' ya, full of hesteria
More rabid than a Pitbull-Terrier
I'll smoke a bit a dope and float like a herrier
I'd say get ready but there is no preparing ya
For the character, against violence
A giant, not using your right to remain silent
You want a rap career? You can't have it
Your not O.J., you need to take another stab at it
Sad faggot, when I start to rap and add magic
They gasp at it, like asthmatic crack-addicts
And laugh at at, fanatic estatic rap-static, dap tragic
You'll get caught up like you're in bad traffic
Dramatic, traumatic, skillfull syllables
Unkillable
Was fed wack rappers through my umbilical
Still filled with bullshit topics and profit off it
Pocket a lot of dollars while the followers jock it

[chorus]

[Kasper - Verse 3]
One of the nicest alive and breathing, still in the lead with this
I'm pleased to leave them bleeding, pleading the fifth
Nobody spits like this anymore
I'm from the underground where clowns get torn apart, it's the art of war
You want respect you gotta earn it, take it
Don't expect to get it with Rolex's or a Lexus
I bet your necklace on my life you won't win on the mic
By the likes of you faggots it'll be a tragic sacrifice
After stabbing you twice you'll be handing your life over
I rhyme colder, freezing time with every line
Use your mind soldier, I keep mine sober
Goes as a lyrical show, the wit, the instincs of a King Cobra
I bring closure with no remorse or remission, the flow is gorgeously sickened
The aura glows in the written's
I'm spittin' nothing but illness, skill, and resilience
I kill 'em with brilliance, you don't have to feel this, but still

[Chorus]</pre>
