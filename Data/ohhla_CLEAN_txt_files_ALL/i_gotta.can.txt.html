Listen to me everybody, I got a story to tell
Well, well

Ono wan make beef outta steam fish?
Tell ya artist keep my name out they mouth or you wont have no peace
Compared to Canibus ya pitbulls is poultry
You and Biggie made a dope team but i roast beans
Be careful how you approach things
My name aint J to the Muahh, mann i got a flow that stings
Its rap music, you confuse it if you want to
I might still diss you just to see what you gon do
You must be gettin' insecure or something
I'm just admirien ya shit mann I aint gon touch it
I been through alotta things in my life but I learned from it
Put yaself in my shoes, dont I deserve something?
The only difference between me and you is a BUDGIT
Dont make me have to go sign with Suge or something
Remember this: History repeats itself
Whenever that never ending hunger meets itself
Everybody want they wealth, peace and health
When I was fucked up you aint give me a couple of G's to help, did you?
No, you waited fa my cheese to melt
You want all the hot beats and the streets to yourself
Well  my (??) niggaz different enough to attract interest
From anybody in the rap business and I'ma get it cash or credit
Besides a little drama from my first 2 records
Rip the Jackers images is unblemished
Come on I wouldnt bite you I look at you like my dentist
I thought you was number one recommended, why you offended?
Hip hop aint ya property, you aint the only tenant
If I win the lottery you cant tell me how to spend it
You got something to say, dont put ya Henchmen in it
Them little monkey faced artist that you sign fa pennies
I refuse to serve them like Dennies
You know they rhymes is petty
Dont tell me that ya school of hard knocks turn preppy
None of yall motha fuckers know me and you never met me
And if my name wasnt shit then you wouldnt sweat me
Thats ubsurd right? Me gettin busy get on ya nerves right?
You really are listenin to the words right?
High when i wrote this but sober when I spoke it
Its not like I tried to promote it like Jay-o did, ya notice?
Mann I was never focused on you
I just spit hard on the mic cause my shit is hot too
I went out and bought ya album 2 times, I aint hatin'
Next thing I know you talkin Jamaican like you a native
But you really violatin', you dont know what you sayin'
Canibus aint in the game so you know he aint playin
I had nothing before and I have nothing now
Fuckin' with a nigga with nothing only brings you down
