Ahh... it's time to slow it down one bit
{*chuckles*} Like this

[Danny!]
Yeah... +Payback+ is a bitch
Had to slow it down, one time, yo...

Why'd, you... call me so late, tonight?                     (Why you callin me, yo?)
Let me guess, somebo-dy else, has broken your heart, right? (AGAIN? Word?)
I don't... wanna hear that, shit                            (I don't wanna hear that shit, man)
If you think, I do, you must, be outta your mind, bitch    (Gone crazy)

But I tryyyyy to be nice
Really wish you'd leave me alone
Stop asking meeeee for advice
Why you gotta put me in the friend zone?

What, the... fuck do I look, like?                        (What do I look like yo?)
What'd I e-ver do, to make, you think this was al-right?  (Where the hell did I slip up, f'real?)
I'm, not... one of your girl-friends                      (Not Kerry, not Shelly, heheh)
Not your B-F-F, so what, the fuck is you think-in?        (What YOU thinkin f'real?)
I don't... wanna hear that, shit                          (I don't wanna hear that shit, man!)
If you think, I do, you must, be outta your mind, bitch  (Gone loco)

But I tryyyyy to be nice
Really wish you'd leave me alone
Stop asking meeeee for advice                (Deal with it, deal with it)
Why you gotta keep me in the friend zone?     (Sure can't deal with it)

Trust, me... I secretly hate, you                                (Hate your fucking guts! Haha!)
Every time, you call, to whine, about what you've been, through  (Boo-hoo-hoo, here we go again)
No, dude... wants to be that, dude                               (FUCK NO!)
So I'm not, the on-ly one, the fuck you expect... boo?           (Fuck outta here! Word)
I don't... wanna hear that, shit                                 (Yo I don't wanna hear that shit, man)
If you think, I do, you must, be outta your mind, bitch         (Outta your mind)

But I tryyyyy to be nice
Really wish you'd leave me alone
Stop asking meeeee for advice                (Deal with it, deal with it)
Why you have to put me in the friend zone?     (Sure can't deal with it)

(Deal with it, deal with it)
Why you have to put me in the friend zone? (Sure can't deal with it)

(Deal with it, deal with it)
Why you have to put me in the friend zone? (Sure can't deal with it)

(REEEEEMIIIIIX~!!!)

Niggaz talk shit about the friend zone
Askin for my number, so they can bone
But I'm a bad bitch and got no time for that
Still they wanna swallow my love like spinal tap
The queen of rhyme is back with a healthy dose of swag
It ain't friend zone, we just don't want your ugly ass
So I don't get mad off the silly pettiness
I say, to hell with it, say, oh well with it
Danny Swain is known as a lame around these parts
Make dope beats but he's a simp at heart
I call him on the phone, complain about my man
I know the nigga want me, I know it's 3 a.m.
But what's a girl to do? Affection needed constant
Attnetion I'm a whore for that, I got some options:
One, call this nigga Danny! on the tele
Two, make him think he gettin all this jelly
Three, keep him as a confidant, you crazy?!
If that'sthe friend zone to you, I'm sorry baby
Can't nobody, see us in the 2012
or the 2013... the hell?!
...The hell?! (Hey girls and guys)
...The hell?! (Hey girls and guys)
...The hell?! (Hey girls and guys)
(Frikky-frikky-frikky) ...The hell?!

[Danny!]
I don't wanna, wanna hear that shit
Wha-what, wha-wh-what
I don't wanna, wanna hear that shit
Wha-what, wha-whaaaat
I don't wanna, wanna hear that shit
Wha-what, wha-wh-what
I don't wanna, wanna hear that shit
Wha-what, wha-whaaaat

[Outro]
I gotta give a shout-out, to all the girls
who put us in the friend zone for NO reason
"Thank you for makin us, who we are today"
