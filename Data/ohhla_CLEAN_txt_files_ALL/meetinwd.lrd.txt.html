[Intro: Lord Superb]
Three fucking months, man? I just did six years, man
I'm back in this muthafucker man, yo, C.O.
Thirt-fucking-teen? Man, you come back in here, man
I'mma blast your stupid ass, shorty
My word, I'mma wrap you the fuck up, that's my word
Where my muthafucking lawyer, at?
I been through some shit, man
And you wanna play with it?
Aiyo, tell 'em I passed my 188
I wish a nigga would, let me tell you something, man

[Lord Superb]
Death came to see me last night
Said I'll be back in 20 years, Perb, get your ass right
You right, when I come back, I'mma give you 20 more
All that heartache and pain, you gon' see plenty more
You guaranteed heaven, if you can make it through hell
That's when he introduced himself as Death
Said I already met his man Jail
I'm like Death, why you killed Nana?
He said that wasn't my decision, God's the best planner
But Bad Times stepped in, he said
I got the hood fucked up, Perb, I was repping
Struggle called me up impersonating the landlord
Like Lord, I'm terminating your room and board
I ain't afraid of Death, I know Death coming
When Death start knocking, tell Death come in
What up, D? Heard you was looking for me
Was it you, who sent them kids to Brooklyn for me?
Then told them to pack bigger guns and wear vestes
Cuz Smith and Wessings leave chestes on staircases
Plus them dudes that tried to get me at the train station
For the bracelet, pulled out trey eights quick
But I dipped, pulled out the long four fifth
Squeeze my shit, almost broke my wrist
And at the Colisseum, he thought I didn't see him
I started up the car, and tried to MPV him
Death almost had me in HBM
The stupid ass Puerto Ricans tried to leave my throat leaking
You know me, I had my shit tweaking
Plus the lock on the sock, I got the kid decent</pre>
