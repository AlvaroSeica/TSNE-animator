Song:   Have You Ever Wondered
Typed by: seseruel@yahoo.com

Have you ever wondered why the birds don't sing
Have you ever wondered why your soul don't ring
Have you ever wondered why your ears can't hear
exactly what's goin' on from front to rear
Have you ever wondered what goes on behind closed doors
and Have you ever wanted to just lay on the floor
and sit back and just let the world pass and you just wanted to just crash
Have you ever on the real just wanted to be a thug
Have you ever heard some shit that just made you bug
Have you ever wanted to do drugs
and just sit back and just lay down on the roof
Have you ever wanted to just sit back and chill
Have you ever wanted to know how everybody feels
Have you ever wanted to lay on a field
and look up at the stars forever and build
Have you ever wondered why Steve's so sexy
Ever wonder why it's possible Sean beat Alexy
Have you ever wanted to just sit in a taxi
and laugh 'cause everybody else is just passin'
Have you ever wondered why popper stoppers don't work
Have you ever wondered why we gotta stop in a jerk
Have you ever wondered why my dick is so small
and Have you ever wondered why we exist in St. Paul
Have you ever wondered why we gotta sound stupid
Have you ever been shot in the heart by cupid
I'll tell you one thing; I haven't and that's a problem
but as long as I can do this, yo I can't fathom
Have you ever wondered why the drums sound phat
Have you ever wondered why they went away black
and Have you ever wondered why I gotta stand here and feel claustrophobic
you should know shit
Have you ever wondered why we gotta get illah
Have you ever wondered why we gotta keep it realah
Have you ever wondered why we're not about the scrillah
Have you ever wanted to do this mass appealah
and Have you ever wanted to rap king of the show
and Have you ever wanted to try getting cornrows
and Have you ever wanted to try getting up a kind of acid drug
just to get beat down by a thug
who wouldnt let you shine or buy his shit except marijuana
because he thought if you wouldn't do it you'd be a goner
and Have you ever had ill concerns for people
who wouldn't let you burn or rather see your soul burn
Have you ever had a problem with people who tried to kill you
and that shit is real dude
and Have you ever seen a video and said damn
I wish that was my life instead of some guy's, right
and Have you ever wondered why Jay-Z sucks
and Have you ever wondered why Lil Kim's a slut
Have you ever wondered why Foxy Brown's ugly
and never get up on my dick that don't bug me
and Have you ever wondered why we bullshit
Ever wonder why we gotta pull shit
Have you ever wondered why preachers hide behind their pulpit
and preach forever, it's not clever...</pre>
