Song:   Vanity
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I promise it comes with the guilt
How awesome is this narcissism?
You save your hard earnings to pay for these nigga's opinions

[Chorus 2X: Wale]
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity do you see?
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity do you see?

[Verse 1]
I said it ain't on me so I need more bottles
Okay these lames gon' see that I need more hotter
See I got it till 10 cause my T cost dollars
Swear my chain so big that it by my collar

Cold stunna
Rose-gold for something
Concordes where the shit are these oceans 11's
Club jumping
And it's like I got a black heart
Ever since I swiped that black card
And I gave that shit with 10 deals
Let these niggaz know we in the building
Because I spend these 7 bills
Tryna give me all their feelings

[Chorus: Gary Jules]
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

[Chorus 2X: Wale]
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity do you see?
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity do you see?

[Verse 2]
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity do you see?
Ya ain't pay up for no pussy but you pay for what she see
M.O.B., M.O.B
Yes, as far as I can see
But these broads jocking me is validating my conceit
Obviously show you rare
Don't you wonder why she hit
Open bottles, open convos, open wallets, open legs
Open cleavage, open eyes, open wide, open thighs
Oh behave
My old school got more vroom than your new ride
Look at me, look at me
Now he creeping up the street
Got a thousand on that V, got you stunting on a G
Ran, damn, plan, scheme
Just to show you that he got it till they hot for that VI
Watch them plot it while they watching
Way before these bitches
Niggaz dying over process
Bitches dying for attention
Niggaz drop it just to plop em
Is it really that important, is it really that serious?
I'm curious, this really shit we livin for opinioners

[Chorus: Gary Jules]
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

[Chorus 2X: Wale]
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity do you see?
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity do you see?

We're fucking up the club now, club now
Don't stay on the Rose now, Rose now
They say how far we pulling in, pulling in
Watch me make me do me thing, do me thing
We're fucking up the club now, club now
Don't stay on the Rose now, Rose now
They say how far we pulling in, pulling in
Watch me make me do me thing, do me thing
Take it</pre>
