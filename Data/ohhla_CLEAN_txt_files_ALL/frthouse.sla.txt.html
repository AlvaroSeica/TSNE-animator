Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Eminem] All the ugly people be quiet! {*2X*}
[Royce]  Wave (ay!) {*7X*}

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
I got a house full of bitches, niggaz, it is goin down
I'ma hold my own, yeah
Bitches layin on the floor like it's a crack house
Uh, welcome to the frat house
Condoms, kegs, liquor, weed, pills
I'ma hold my own, yeah
Bitches layin on the floor like it's a crack house
Uh, welcome to the frat house

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Your lady's on my dick, you'll probably be mad
if you find out I had her skippin biology class
Uhh, yeah, you got comedy cash
I'm quarter of the Slaughter, half of the dream team, the anomaly Bad
Yeah, we here to riot the scene
Quiet your entire college up, tie up your dean
Uhh, yeah, my Q-Dog's on that step shit
I'm 'bout to send a text to my next ex-bitch
Yeah, have you on pills, on 'shrooms
Have you feelin like "ooh-lah-lah-lah!"
Now it's soundin like Lauryn Hill's in your dorm room
Spit at me wrong get hit with my new llama!
Yeah, it'll knock him out his shoes
Droppin mo' niggaz than who droppin outta school
Slaughterhouse gang, streamers, confetti
The squeamish, had better, get ready - because

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
LBC, we them Beach boys
We don't need your education, we Pink Floyd
I'm gettin destroyed
I'm gettin oral from a Maury sexy decoy, she on that E boy
She pay her tuition with webcams and PayPal
School in L.A., she say she from 8 Mile
Her pussy hotter than a +Chili Pepper+, I tell her lay down
And "give it away, give it away now"
Later on she'll be wearin my letterman jacket
Reach in your pocket (Mollies) medicine packet
Let 'em attack it cause that's my regular tactic
Cause that's what let 'em get active, whoever said I'm romantic
is wrong, hope you got a powerful chin
Cause they say, blowjobs are flowers for men
I'ma need about a dozen, go get your guzzlin cousins
and your trouser arousers, we whylin again

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden] + (Joell Ortiz)
Uhh, see I'm a on-stage rock star (backstage porn star)
Gave my lap top (then I threw her on the armoire)
Make it +Red Storm+ when that St. John in you
(Brain in the college in Philly, call that +Temple+)
Yeahhhh (I like a really huge ass)
Bend over, take her to church, now she in +U-Mass+
Scoop my Spelman broad for all-out sex
Show her twelve bedrooms, still it's +Morehouse+, left
Yeahhh (titty in my left hand)
(Drunk as a freshman on his tenth keg stand)
Got a sophomore, all jaw, give me drunk head
Roommate joined in climbin down from the bunkbed
Yeahhhh (matter fact, noooo!)
(Yo, I am so, throoooowed)
This pill gave me a new demeanor
(Chris Reeves graduated, I'm a +Super+ senior)
