Song:   Too Much On It
Typed by: JohnnyChyngaz@aol.com

Too much on it (on it)
Too much on it (on it)      *singing in background*
Too much on it (on it)      {La la la la la la la la la la la la..}
Too much on it (on it)

Where's my coke
No time for petty shit
I cannot hold a straight face when i politic
I'm above all of this so you could talk fast
You could spit stare or laugh when i walk past
I don't give a fuck it's all flowin now
I sport Hennessy and food when I'm goin out
I don't pay to play i do this everyday
I don't need to look your way i got my eyes on the prize
I hear them lies and they kinda make me mad
Kinda make me grab for space empty and sad
Don't see my face and jump to conclusions 
I'll pump this EQ, shit is best
I'm using arrest, the reminisce
Skipped on attendance, they guided me nowhere
Can't trip if they spin this
Put it on a 10 inch they still couldn't see me
Go buy The Grouch or wait till they believe me
Then I'm like Stevie but i got the anger
Do you wanna hang or act like a beggar
My face is blank i ain't got no mug
Relax and dig this don't tell me what you dug
Bug in the system, everybody's bitchin'
Go and set your risk then if that's your mission
(If that's your mission)

[Chorus 2x]
There's too much on it (on it)
Kick back and act like you love life and want it
There's too much on it (on it) 
Tomorrow's on the way, don't trip off today

*singing* 3x
{La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la}

I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna argue
I don't wanna hate you or think that you're fake
I don't wanna trip off no stupid shit
Or get tripped on when you feelin that I'm wrong
I just wanna write maybe tonight
Don't wanna have to prove to anyone I'm cool
I jus wanna be, I jus wanna see
Taste, smell and hear, live for hella' years
I don't wanna die, don't wanna have to cry
Don't wanna want to hate without a reason why
This is what it is and only what it is
Have an open mind, make your own kind
Earn your own dime, be real with you
Be real with him and be real with her too
Earn your own dime, be real with you
Be real with him and be real with her too

[Chorus 2x]

*singing* 3x
{La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la}

Too much on it (on it)
Too much on it (on it)
Too much on it (on it)
Too much on it (on it)</pre>
