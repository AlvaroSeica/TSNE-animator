(Master P)
Uptown. Ya heard me Calliope 36-49 go cross the Bra
Bridge and make a left

Chorus: Suga Bear (repeat 2x's)

I'll be hangin uptown(hangin)
With my niggas

(Master P)
Uptown baby, don't clown baby
It's going down baby, I'm with my rounds baby
Uptown CP3, nigga my block stay hot
You rally dirty war, nigga I got it on lock
From the Mac to the Meph to the Calliope
Nigga in the bricks at night fool anything goes
Rose Tavern is the spot were I stash the glock
Hoody Hoo, Run forest here comes the cops
Nigga second line badge where my peeps get killed
R.I.P. T' shirts nigga to remember the real
Sam Skulley got killed and Big Glen got Life
My lil cousin Jimmy did 8 
but now he's trying to change his life

(Chorus 2x's)

(Mac)
Now let me take you to the land of the choppers
pussy poppers and body droppers
crooked cops and quarter shops
when the cop shopper
you get your hands on a a bird
don't say a word
there is a million coke spots with no coke to serve
when you see them nigga swerve in the Lexus
and you can't get no buss pass
to get your ski mask, and get a click
but make sure it niggas you been fucking with get a bitch
bout that murder, murder and sucking dick
on the slick doe, cause they pulling akickdoes
and I think it was them nigga out that Thomas
cause they had them black macs and bombers
but you didn't hear that me, I can't talk, I can't see 
look matter fact when it happen, I was overseas with P
and that how a nigga be, I be on GT with wears and boots
when them fucking people spin in, my niggas holla "OOP OOP"
and if a nigga find ya, we second line behind ya
blow some ganja in your memories
sportin Tee's to remind ya we still

(Chorus 2x's)

(C-Murder)
Now if you looking for me playa
when I'm down in the city
you wanna get with me then hit me
or come in that Calliope and get me
for real ask Whine and Eyes
I be down in the cut
me, Boo Gee and Tee Dee
we be tearing shit up
feel my rounds, uptown them tuff guys on the block
just like Slim and Marcello
they got that Nolia on lock
and that Rose Tavern
I'm chillling right in front of Randall pictures
they hit cha but ask Victor
where gonna always be with cha
I'll let Lil Cory tell a story while he down in the 5th
I hit the spliff, pass the twirk and yell CP3
We make a move and bounce the House of Blues
full of Tequila, we left the dagger shop
them po po's sweating the block
and now it's back to the Calliope
(it's back to the Calliope)
the driveway of the middle of 3rd Ward code
I represent it lil daddy
cause it's a Calliope thing
and uptown is the place where I chill and hang

(Chorus 2x's)</pre>
