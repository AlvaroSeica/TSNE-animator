[Intro: Future]
Pluto..
Future...
{K.E. on the Track}
HEY!

[T.I.]
Tell you off the top, I'm bossed up
Yee ain't talkin money, don't talk us
I'm steady stackin that guap up
Ball harder than you when I'm locked up
You the type a nigga just popped up
when nigga rollin that kush, huh?
Got mine growin like grapevines 
in the backyward, come look, brah
I pull up, hop out
Bad hoes just pop out
Hatin niggaz better watch out
Still ridin with that glock out
My style so mean 'til it's hostile
and aggressive dawg, come check ya dog
Spend a couple mil, no stress at all
Big bankroll, no checks at all
FYI: I'm flexin, y'all
Game A1 professional
You small ball like y'all balls
I'm basketball, go ask your broad
'til her legs open - sesame
Abracadabra, she wet for me
Like ta-da~! Voilà!
Gucci, Louie, Stravers, Prada - AH!

[Chorus: Future]
Fishtailin out the parking lot, leavin Magic (Skerrrt~!)
Two bad bitches and I got 'em outta Magic
The way I make the work disappear, call it magic (Remix!)
Sippin on the purple and the yellow, drinkin magic (Lean!)
Voilà - magic, voilà - magic (Straight up..)
Voilà - magic, voilà - magic
Fishtailin out the parking lot, leavin Magic 
Sippin on the purple and the yellow, drinkin magic

[Future]
On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
Call on my accountant, he gon' make it do magic
Had to get a driver just to drop me at the airport (For what?)
Way I smoke the blunts, man, I burn 'em up like Newports
Fif' thou in Auto Zone, superstar attire
K.E. and Young Future bringin 'em fire
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire (Turn it up)
Gotta drop a half a brick, you wanna put me on the flyer (Future)
Excuse me but my name go crazy, see these diamonds, ain't none of 'em fugazi
Two bad bitches wanna fuck me the greatest, a O.G. and a brand new Mercedes
Turned out a lot, I'ma do a 180, for the haters I'ma gon' 'head and do a 360
Trickin on the Sprite, got lean all in it
I'm an astronaut nigga, better church my pimpin

[Chorus]

[Future]
Billionaire boy, that's a true inspiration
I'm the astronaut kid, no such thing as limitation (Bass)
Ridin down 20 in the muh'fuckin spaceship (Takeoff!)
Just left Magic in a muh'fuckin day shift (Skerrrt!)
Two bitch trailin in a Beamer out of Germany
Got a thing for the haters, don't wanna sing for the haters, not my energy, I'm a embassy
I know tricks like Criss Angel, I don't trick but I could make you famous
You would disappear from your past life, you a rare pair, go outta sight
I'm Pluto talkin, Jimi walkin, when you walkin, I used to be fly
But now I'm hawkin, I was on earth and now I'm sci-fi - Voilà~!
I stay high, my bitch is on they high horse
I double barrel like two cups and pull out of that new Porshe
(SKEEEEERT~!) {*VROOM*}
