(Peace!) Piece of what?
You can't mean P-E-A-C-E
Cause I've seen people on the streets
Shoot the next man and turn around and say peace
But that's leaving people in pieces
It's not what the meaning of peace is
To me it means absence of all confusion
Not the oozing and brusing
That we're all so accumstomed to
Your friend got beef?  I'll bust him too
What a brother from a certain way of life explained to me once, dunce
He didn't realize the fact that
He and myself were brothers on the same rope
Now last month he got hemmed up, huh, that's all she wrote
So I can get up where she left the exclamation
Looking for an explanation
Little kids think that peace is a word that you use to sound down
And I frown
Cause that's what I was told at eaight years old
And now I'm trying to break the mold
So stop the dominoes
Because I think it's about time that everyone knows

Peace!  But everybody's in terror
We're going back to the caveman era
Where people got killed, without the chance to build
Shame how the plane is filled
With so many so-called intellects 
That can't use a word in its proper context
Needless to say I'm vexed, so what's next?

Peace!  It's not the word to use
When at the same time you got the plans to abuse
Folks not on their P's and Q's
I'll see you in the news
Somebody screwed up the diction
You might die looking for the right definition
Cause "peace" nowadays means "gun," or "gotta run"
30 years from now we'll wonder how the younger generation got foul
Look at what we teach them today
Peace is not the word to play

Ayo, corny or not, we gotta stop saying "peace" and not meaning it
Know what I'm saying?  Main Source forever, y'all
Peace is not the word to play</pre>
