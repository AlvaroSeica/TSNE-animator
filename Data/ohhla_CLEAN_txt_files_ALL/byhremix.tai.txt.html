[Verse 1 - Ludacris] - w/ Taio Cruz repeating "whoa" in the background
Luda! Now I may not be the worst or the best but you gotta respect my honesty
And I may break your heart but I don't really think there's anybody as bomb as me
So you can take this chance in the end, everybody's gonna be wonderin how you deal
You might say this is Ludacris but Taio Cruz tell her how you feel

[Verse 2 - Taio Cruz]
Now listen to me baby
Before I love and leave ya
They call me heartbreaker
I don't wanna deceive ya

[Break - Taio Cruz]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby from the start

[Chorus - Taio Cruz] - 4X
I'm only gonna break, break ya, break, break ya heart

[Break 2 - Taio Cruz] - 2X
Whoa

[Verse 3 - Taio Cruz]
There's not point tryin to hide it
No point tryin to evade it
I know I got a problem
By doin this behavin

[Break]

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 - Ludacris] - w/ Taio Cruz repeating "whoa" in the background
Thats all I'm gonna do woman
Listen, now I'm only gonna break yo heart
and shatter and splatter it all into little bitty pieces
Whether or not you get it all together
then it's finders keepers and losers weepers
See I'm not tryin to lead you on, no I'm only tryin to keep it real
You might say this is Ludacris but Taio Cruz tell her how you feel

[Verse 5 - Taio Cruz]
Hey and I know karma's gonna get me back for bein so cold
Hey, like a big bad wolf, I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone
Hey, if you fall for me, I'm only gonna tear you apart
Hey, told ya from the start, hey

[Chorus]

[Break 2] - 4X</pre>
