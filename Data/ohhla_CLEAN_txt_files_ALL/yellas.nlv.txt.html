(Jamaican)
Lil Ya run the beat now boy one time

{Verse 1: Lil Ya}
Peep it, It aint over ya'll I got some shit on my chest
These niggaz bitin our beats givin me reasons to flex
You know they know, when we catch em we gon rag em
Tie them clowns up 3rd ward style, commits to drag 'em
Through the fuckin river, shit is realer than it ever been
Them sucka's playin knowin how the "U" spin the bin
And when I'm mad aint no tellin what Lil Ya do
Run in yo crib, kill yo kids and ya Mama too
Then find you and make you pay fa what you done to my dog
30, 30 gettin dirty ready to take ya wig off
I fuck with Marlbaro to try to keep my self stable
Loadin guns at the brown table
Now I'm able, capable to take another one out
Loose lips, sank ships shouldnt of been runnin ya mouth
now I'ma ride out after I kill and destroy
This is revenge fa my lil nigga...

{Tec-9}
Bad Ass Yella Boy

{Hook 2x}
[Tec-9]
Now you could copy all ya wanna, you could even try to sing it
But none of yall niggaz can bring it like we bring it
[Lil Ya]
This aint no remake horsenapper we the real MCcoys
This is revenge fa my lil nigga...
[Tec-9]
Bad Ass Yella Boy

{Verse 2: Tec-9}
Clique tight with my group and I'm lettin them guns rang
Matched up, dressed in black and I'm throwin them thangs
Kept it low and on the tuck for about 4 years
But now you niggaz gotta pay there's, no more tears
Now a rumor done got out that UNLV's comin again
Motha fucka that means that nobody sells tapes again
Took a blow to the group, but we troops: We never die
I told ya'll motha fuckers time after time
We Uptown Niggaz Livin Violent, violent
Now I'ma ride for the sake of just ridin
The Hood Mac and Flexis hit the block and now they hidin
Revenge fa what ya'll did to one of my friends
I got my money right so we could go to war, spin the bin
All that yappin but I'll get loaded again
Dont make me shoot a bag and go to cave ya bitches chest in
Now I'ma ride after I kill and destroy
This is revenge fa my lil nigga Bad Ass Yella Boy
Call shots like yall get blood clots, dont try nigga

{Hook 2x}

{Verse 3: Lil Ya &amp; Tec-9}
[Ya]
We come to drag 'em once again spin the bin with the 4-10
Leavin a note around his neck that reads:

[Tec]
Yella revenge

[Ya]
I caught him slippin at the liquor store
Cock the four, kick the door, he scream like a hoe
"Ya dont shoot me no more" (fa sho)

[Tec]
You betta be lookin for some bullet proof head gear
Fuck the dumb shit I'm takin dome shots this year
Knock ya down like they did the St. Thomas
Leave bitches in shock and niggaz next to comas

[Ya]
Look, I wait behind the mailbox, my disquise is smooth
Fitted like a business man rockin Timberland boots
Smokin the Gru that I told ya put the evil on my mind
While I wait to buck this nigga with this nine, so stop cryin

[Tec]
Which one of you motha fuckers got the nuts to run up on us?
Get sliced up by us, when I get to use the Mac ninety
Get real grimey, skedatle to the West where you cant find me
I can mother fucker do a 90

[Ya]
I got these niggaz hostage, this bitin gotta stop bitch
Everything we make you bitches jockin tryna copy it

[Tec]
Ride on out, I dont want no mother fuckin dap
Now who killed my boy Yella aka Fella?
Hard head rapper crushin ya bone

[Ya]
I be eager to kill a nigga dump his body in the river
On the realla boy I'ma familiar Guerrilla

[Tec]
Ya'll know I'm steady thuggin
Huffin and puffin you niggaz buggin
The Hood Mac and Flexis hit the block and start the bustin
*3 Gun Shots*

{Hook 2x}
