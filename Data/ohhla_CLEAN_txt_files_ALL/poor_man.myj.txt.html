(PSC):
If you like what we do then give thanks 
that the thought banks deposits are plenty
And many to offer the author of this one, gives one to ponder upon
Our arrival, the smiles, they come forth
Of course you might know this, woes my status
Barred from the major stations, but fuck 'em
Hip-hop's my language
Maybe we stuck 'em with doses of the trueness too strong to stomach
I love it! You can't shut this shit down
Revenge, read the label, we rule in this town
Shit, burn in the fire which you create
Just like Co-Flow, you can't break the 'Sole' of these Mystiks
Put it down every time
Living Legends gotta rise from the grime
Put it down with Shui and K-one
We havin' so much fun out here we can't even hold a beer
Gimme a beer man....

(BFAP):
I hate eatin' nasty shit when I'm broke (eeayuck!)
I just sorta smoke til I got a headache
I used to make a tuna fish plate on a bed of Dorito's
And my toes would be on funk mode
I'd be on the commode letting out the constipation of my life go
I guess that's when I decided to be self reliant
Emsoyas or dictators might call it defiant
Cuz I wasn't talkin' about workin' for nobody no more
I used to go into the store ashy, and put on some lotion
And then be postin' on isle 3, and go and put on some 'D'
In the underground I make my living
Giving all that I got cuz you got only one shot to do this
You can't be pissed, sitting high on your couch
Like almost everyone I know out
Couch revolutionists, with no ammo to go into battle
Living Legends grabbed the saddle and rode these dreams to breeze
With the kings of destiny
But that be on some high tangent shit
I just get mad when the jealousy hits the realms of my friends
That's why I stay down to earth
In with my school, better yet, my shovel doin' work
Maybe one day everybody will understand what they must do
Until then, stay with your mind
I'm only gonna let you know cuz I dropped out of school
To do six world tours, trying to make it to the core and side B
Revenge, our own black owned company
International sales over foreign seas
Is where me and Tommy be in '97
See how they tried to tape us down
But they never keep out ass down now
Now, ah, keep your roots to the ground
Now, ah, don't be a fuckin' hound
That's the way we gonna go now....
