(*talking*)
Say uh, I'm out the beam nigga
Damn it feel good, to be free nigga
Check game nigga, uh

[Hook - 2x]
Thirty minutes off lock, and I'ma rock the block
I really don't care, if the beat hot or not
Just let me in the booth, so I can spit the truth
Are you ready motherfucker, I'm bout to come through

[Mike D]
S.U. motherfucking C
Who I be, Mike D
Miggity Mike D, Boss Hogg Corleon
The black Osama, with my chrome
Niggaz better watch out, I promise that
Cause niggaz ain't ready, cause I'ma handle that
Everything was talked about, Corleon
I'll come back to ya nigga, I'ma get millions
In the game, and get gone
I got my spanking from the Lord, and I'm bout to move on
Niggaz, ain't ready though
Y'all ain't, ready though
We bout, to come through
Rolling with my niggaz, in blue

[Grace]
G to the R-A-C to the E
Money over bitches, you niggaz know me
I'm the game runner head hunter, scoping a beam
Me and Pimper give it to em, underground thoed king
By the name Mr. Chase, S.U.C. representer
Legendary game spitter, quickly bout to beginner
Got me touched by the Don, underground phenomenon
Back on the streets and in the mix, suckers high like Sadaam
I call it by back I want that, this underground mine
Incarcerated the calendar, now I'm back on the grind
Still sharper thinking smarter, screaming new world order
On a T and running best, from H-Town to the border
Transactions stacking still macking, and always 4-5 packing
Accummilating my cheese, like we all Greenbay packing
Got it Houston like the Texans, busting like Smith &amp; Wessons
Kick up dust and raising hell, like cowards on old westerns
New millennium entrepreneur, bitch a mighty thug
The whole click hungry, and it's time to grub
Back on the streets and out the Penn, and it's time to get it
Sho' I'm fa sho with it, true to it and done did it
Like a booth I bring it back, spitting heat on tracks
Rip microphones burn out on chrome, counting nothing but stacks
Problem solved we in my lab, better lay heads flat
4-5 to the dome, now that's what I call crack cuz</pre>
