Chorus:
We keep embellishing upon the new unchartered path
Expressing what  we see and how we comprehend the math
So there's enough for everyone we gotta make it last
We gotta make it last

As I embark on life's journey from the point where im at
Piece to everyone I know and who I go way back with
Every pimp, every mack
Every gangstar, the Jack
Every hustler feeding babies
Anybody pro-black
Every sister raising kids without the help of a dad
Wanting for they're children all the things that they never had
All the brothers handling businesses, I know shit's hard
Wakin up at 5 a.m. holding down 3 jobs
All my Rasta bretheren getting insight from trees
To my brothers up in college getting PHD's
Or any other degree
Even if you just reading for mental health
Feed your conscious so that your mind is free
All my people locked down for your past mistakes
Mentally and spiritually dwelling past the gates
You can change your ways
Elevate today
To all recovered alcoholics chillin up in AA    
Every black-owned business keep doin for self
Helpin out the community and spreadin the wealth
Understanding help aint gonna come from nowhere else
Revolutionary's fakin me and just get dealt
With head on black people got to lead the task
Educate keep learnin', got to  question, ask
And let your light keep shinin and remember the past
By any means necessary you'll be free at least

Chorus

As I embark on life's journey from the point where I'm at
Peace to everybody strivin to live right and exact
Even though anxieties try to pull you down
See your troubles as a blessing and you're homeward bound
Everybody gotta struggle, that's the way of the world
Can't develop biceps if you don't do curls
Can't achieve a garden if you never water your crops
If you never pay your dues then you don't get props
Can't eat a proper meal without cooking it first
Can't  receive a paycheck if you don't do work
If it wasn't for the rain then the trees won't grow
When the spring came 'round what a site to bestow
When you face adversities, dark cloud won't last
If you never study how do you expect to pass?
The grasshoppers laid around while the ants did chores
When the winter came around he was left outdoors
See the cycle keeps moving like a big machine
Evolution of the mind, soul, body and being
God'll never put up on you more than you can take 
Sometimes you even gotta learn from other people's mistakes
With head on black people got to lead the task
Educate keep learnin', got to  question, ask
And let your light keep shinin and remember the past
By any meeans necessary you'll be free at least
