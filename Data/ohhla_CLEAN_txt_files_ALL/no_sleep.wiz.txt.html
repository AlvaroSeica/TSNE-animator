Last night I let the party get the best of me
Wakin up in the morning, two hoes layin next to me
Plus I heard an officer arrested me
Good weed and cold drinks, that's the motherfuckin' recipe
Nigga and we roll deep, so deep
It's goin down in this bitch, concrete
We gon' party all night, no sleep
Tell the owner them is all my guys
So tonight everythin is on me

[Bridge]:
The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high we don't see the whole suite
Then fly to a level where you gon' need your own key

[Chorus]:
No drivin, no sleepin
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No drivin, no sleepin
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

Leavin from the club now she wanna stay with us
Came to spend it all, don't care what I'm payin for
Used to be too young, now I'm out here buyin the bar
Everytime I look up, it's another red cup
Bunch of niggaz in the game but they ain't playin with us
They just payin enough
Man them niggaz ain't ballin they just laying it up
Saying they does, I'm just rollin hella weed
On my way to the club
I had to wait at the club
But now I don't cause everythin is on me

[Bridge]
The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high we  see the whole street
We fly, I mean so fly we need a whole wing

[Chorus]

Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party
Let's party alright
(repeat 4x)
 
[Chorus]</pre>
