[Intro: Lemmy]
Ah ma ma!
Alright!
 
[Lemmy]
Listen up here, I'll make it quite clear
I'm gonna put some boogie in your ear
Shake and bop, don't you stop
Dance like a maniac until you drop
I don't mind.. I don't mind
I can run a razor right up your spine
What are you waiting for?
What do you think you were created for?
Show us you care, show us you dare
You don't know what happened, not if you weren't there
 
[Chorus]
Born to raise hell! Born to raise hell!
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell! Born to raise hell!
Voodoo medicine, cast my spell
Born to raise hell! Born to raise hell!
Play that guitar just like ringin a bell
...Take it or leave it!
 
[Whitfield Crane] (everybody)
Going for broke, rock 'til you choke
(It don't matter if you drink or smoke)
 
[Lemmy]
Speak through the beat, get up on your feet
(Sweatin like a hound dog, white as a sheet)
 
[Ice-T]
Don't you be scared, don't you be scared
Everybody terrified, yo it don't seem fair
 
[Lemmy]
What are you waiting for?
What do you think you were created for?
Out of your seat, blind in the heat
Do the nasty boogie mama, stomp your feet
 
[Chorus]
Born to raise hell! Born to raise hell!
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell! Born to raise hell!
Go back to zero, take a pill and get well
Born to raise hell! Born to raise hell!
Be a good soldier and die where you fell
 
...It's your number! 

{*guitar solo while Lemmy yells "Shut up!" and everything else in the background*}
 
[Lemmy]
Serve it back, give it back, give it back (Aw yeah!)
Give it back, give it back, give it back (right)
Give it back, give it back, give it back 
Ohhhhhh STOP~!
 
[Chorus]
Born to raise hell! Born to raise hell!
[Crane]: We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell! Born to raise hell!
[Lemmy]: Go on out and boogie 'cause you never can tell
Born to raise hell! Born to raise hell!
[Ice-T]: Be a good soldier and DIE where you fell!
Born to raise hell! Born to raise hell!
[Everybody]: We know how to do it and we do it real well!
