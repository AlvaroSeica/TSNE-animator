Woke up one day
Said I don't want to play by your rules no more
This school and law, I see the flaws
No fools because, we noticed (yeah) we lost focus [x2]

Now am far from a profit in both kind of senses
Not saying fact so a don't need corrected
Just saying that that's in my perspective
And speaking for those that may feel neglected
like me, see its likely, they don't like me
As tourists walk around and they site-see
Don't want to see me, no not slightly
Rather see an image of place that might be
Censor, my views and my lifestyle 
Followed by many in a life not worthwhile
Turmoil, for miles, its just vile
Paint the exterior and place on a dud smile
Yet we cry underneath
Raised in system the narrows belief
That we can achieve, that maybe we'd be
A little something more than a statistics you see

Woke up one day
Said I don't want to play by your rules no more
This school and law, I see the flaws
No fools because, we noticed (yeah) we lost focus [x2]

[Deeko]
Uh, It's like I couldn't escape
See I was trapped in a box, like Houdini
Showed them light then got out of that lamp, Like a genie 
Us, being the tellers of our own paths
But when the pen reaches the end of the line down want to go back
Music didn't show that, people listening like our phones tapped
Request lines, replay them and go back to the start
They felt a connection like in a slow dance
But now they no longer capture our moments like Kodak
Forced me to a breaking point, wont snap
When the reception becomes deceptive from the fans
No it wont last, I hope that, other rappers will learn the rules
Like holidays and school, these fools, will have to come to terms
Maybe we lost focus, maybe my hearts broken
The pain's showing trying to get back to the forefront
Or maybe I don't want to be famous
The mainstream wont dilute the brushstrokes of paintbrushes that I paint with

[Werd]
Woke up one day
Said I don't want to play by your rules no more
This school and law, I see the flaws
No fools because, we noticed (yeah) we lost focus [x2]

Views hangover Britain, we were drunk on news
We hand over tax to some man in a suit
Its misleading (yeah) we aint even (nah)

You get fucked if work, if you don't or you won't
Then a cant hate you, that's the system we got
With no purpose, they say fuck us</pre>
