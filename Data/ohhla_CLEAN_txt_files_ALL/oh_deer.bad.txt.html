Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I see you sitting on the top, in your better phase
Say, how it feel it feel to be the best and the most paid?
How it feel to be the most praised?
Known to blow the most Haze
Known to have chicks who go both ways and still down to blow J
Remember from rags to riches, being mad ambitious
Screaming "Fuck love" cause you was always mad at bitches
When getting money was the fucking motto
From the place they put potatoes on their nozzles just to silence hollows
Shit, you probably went passed that, Probably still chiefing blunts
As a matter of fact, you probably don't even pass that
You probably in the back of black [?] splitting down the dutch
With a dime chick in the tail flap, but her head is up
I see where the hoes at, but where the bros at?
Call [?] Hey where's your Iphone 44 at?
Or did you end up like most cats who split a lot of cheese together?
The more cheddar, the more better, Ya'll won't be friends forever
And I know it's probably killing you softly, pardon me
Thinking you can handle all of your problems costly
No matter what the cost be, you're quick to try and buy it off
Everything is win-win, you know you can't afford a loss
But blowing up was always the main dream
So I can't get mad if you're flowing in the mainstream
But you knew from now that it'll be this hard
Shit, you learned to trick broads when your dick got hard
And if you can do that, ain't shit should be stopping you
Anything is possible and any obstacle should be hoppable
And now you living where it's tropical, you got the most shade
A letter to my future, Sincerely, your broke days
Mother fuck them broke days
Most praise to the mother fucker most paid

Mother fucker, yeah</pre>
