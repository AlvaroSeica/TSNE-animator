[Intro]
Now won't you chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga?
Now won't you chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga?
Now won't you chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga?
Now won't you chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga?

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I know you hear this train coming, rumbling down the track
Don't miss out on this pimping shawty, it ain't coming back
I'm steamrolling, no controlling while I'm whipping
Smoke stacking, seal cracking while I'm switching
gears, it makes it hard to hear with 15s in the caboose
I'm more Southern than Norfolk bitch, that's why they love what I do
Caution, danger, when I'm on my shit there ain't no slowing down
Picking up the loners that's horny whenever I'm in town
Them yellow-bellies, them-them-them cocoa browns
They love to give me that, choo-choo-choo-choo sound
I toot my horn to all them haters mumbling
cause I know they hear that train coming
Yeah bitch, I know you hear this train coming, hah
Come on now

[Chorus]
You know you want to ride on my locomotive (on my locomotive baby)
and I bleed the brakes off the train till you can't control it (you can't control it mami)
Now won't you chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga? (Choo-choo-ing)
Now won't you chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga? (Choo-choo-ing)
Now won't you chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga? (I'm choo-choo-ing)
Now won't you chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga? (Choo-choo-ing)

[Big K.R.I.T.]
I know you hear this train coming, you best grab your bags
Don't worry bout your partners and them, just bring yo' ass
Now let me break it down, before we go
Don't hold back what the Good Lord gave ya, let it show
Now all aboard for all of those that claim they down to get it
I advise you to exit right if you ain't down with it
Really, I'm just trying to free your mind from its prison
I'll show you how to get off if you just listen
You'll never want to leave here if you just visit
Plus ain't no more cars coming, and time is ticking
Your homegirl just al'ight, I'm kinda picky
But you a booming business, I hope she got a ticket
I know you hear this train coming
Yeah bitch, I know you hear this train coming, hah
Come on now

[Chorus]

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T.]
All aboard~!
Oh you the last one? Let me see your ticket
Where you tryna go now? Hmmm, I don't think this gon' get you there
Yeah I can take you though, if you really wanna go there but
you gotta be just my type shawty, because...</pre>
