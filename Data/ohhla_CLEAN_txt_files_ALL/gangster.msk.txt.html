{Hey Mijo, it's me again. I've been tryin to call you already
5-6 times your not pickin up your phone and I'm worried
Lla son las tres en la manana babe donde estas?}

I know I always bring this up but now it's time we talk
Mijo please take a lil minute sit back and relax
Listen to my words I ain't tryin to be your mom
Te quiero mucho por favor and I deserve to know what's up

All those late night calls, when u gotta bounce
Your homies coming first what's that all about?

I fell in love with a gangster yea, that's right
But I don't think u realize how I hurt inside
Always worryin, mi pelon, if your comin home
That's why I call u so much when you leave me alone
I don't wanna bug and this I promise you but in this situtation
It's so hard to trust you I care about you so much lovin you like
Crazy all I really want is to have your little baby
Tell me that you love me, you will never leave me
Soy la reina de tu vida and your happy to be with me

Daddy let me know that I'm your only girl
The only man that I need in this gangster world
Is you and I wouldn't trade it

So why you think I would lie? won't you tell me girl?
The only one that I need in my gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it

You see, I kno it's been a struggle I can see in your eyes
Tear drops, they fall get me everytime
Baby girl don't cry understand that I try
The only hope that I hold in my gangster life
I hold you dear to my heart thou I'm out in the night
Tryin to make a lil money then come home to a fight
A little fuss can't trust that's it's never enough
Was imbraced by your touch in this thing called
Love I was realeased by prestige with your hand on
My heat I got jar full of boozers so we all can eat
Comprehend that I spend most my time in the street
And all these other wicked women don't matter to me
It's not like I'm just tryin to get up and leave I work hard every
Minute in the face of defeat I stomp my feet with pride
Knowning that your by my side what you think I was just
Gonna let you walk on by?

Daddy let me know that I'm your only girl
The only man that I need in this gangster world
Is you and I wouldn't trade it

So why you think I would lie? won't you tell me girl?
The only one that I need in my gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it

I understand what your tellin me but it's so hard
Always fuss and we fight tell we back at the start
Te amo te quiero mi crazy vato gangero
Se le k yo tengo con tigo pero te tengo
I know you mean well when you hold me tight
The only one who can handle me right
During a fight and I cherish all the times that
I spend with you hold your pictures in my hand
When I pray for you this is gangster love and I'm
Down for whatever lay me down on the cama
And enjoy that were together turn on the candles
Hickies on my cuello mi firme verterano mi firme
Pandillero always down to ride with you like bonnie
And clyde with do I'll always stand with you forever be true
Keep you on my mente siempre mi vida I'm a gangster's
Wife to an anybody killa

Daddy let me know that I'm your only girl
The only man that I need in this gangster world
Is you and I wouldn't trade it

So why you think I would lie? won't you tell me girl?
The only one that I need in my gangster world is you
And I wouldn't trade it
