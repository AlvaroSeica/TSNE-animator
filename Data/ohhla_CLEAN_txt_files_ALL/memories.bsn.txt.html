Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit
So go on, light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it then real life'd it!
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin
They sayin sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael hoe
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it's cool cause I got the title hoe
See I just want my fantasies and real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Motherfuck the radio if I can't hear mine
They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I'm a make it, but even if I don't
Don't feel bad cause honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Chorus]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love?
Or lose your girlfirend or groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set 'til you considered great?
How many missed calls 'til you considered fake?
How many dreams before 'til it's considered fate?
I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that shit feels mentally.
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory"
I'm praying that he make, wishin' we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories...

[Chorus]</pre>
