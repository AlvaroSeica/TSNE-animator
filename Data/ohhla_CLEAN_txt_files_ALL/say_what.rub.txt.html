Typed by: Cno Evil

[Rubbabandz]
Yo, New York, New York, city slicker, my chi come quicker
But Dirty South still flow through my veins, nigga
My grandmother straight from Town Creek, wit C-Town
Right up the street, with racist ass police
And they keep they eyes on me, cuz I come through
Blinding and shining, all my jewelry
Why they trynna run up on me, think you gon' plan a breakup on me?
You got me way in the country, police wear hoodies
Dirty as hell, they try to snatch niggas cookies
Thinking I'm a boss that supplying the work
I got workers for that, I don't do no dirt
I'm a general, you can see the stars on my solar blades
I'm hot in the streets, I don't need the sun rays
It's B-A-N-D-Z, niggas in the streets better respect me

[Chorus 2X: Rubbabandz]
Say what, what, ya'll niggas wanna fuck around
Til ya body on the ground, you won't even hear the sound
Say what, what, ya'll niggas wanna think I'm playing
Til ya body on the pavement, shivering and shaking

[Rubbabandz]
I'm into streetlight, stop signs, and thunderbird rhymes
Bandz, shit, I'm back in town to big spine
I never enter her crib without my nine
Because I'm good under pressure wit my life on the line
If you don't play that, and I don't play that
Then we don't play that, together
And I spray that, then you might spray that
And I'm like fuck it dog, whatever

[Hook 2X: One Third]
This your boy One Third on the track wit Bandz
Now South City Slickers back again
Get the fuck up out the way when I recommend
Cuz we all be like Mexicans

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
