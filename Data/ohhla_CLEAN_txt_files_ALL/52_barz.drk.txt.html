Typed by: AZ Lyrics

30 30's with 30's, 30 niggas we dirty
I got my shooters they shooting, we show them niggas no mercy
From the pot to the block, from the block to the lot
I got a duck from the ops baby to cool with the cops
See my life like a movie, I caught a case for the tooly
The judge given out ten I ain't scared I do it
So if a nigga run up on me I react with the uzi
(If a nigga run up on me I react with the uzi)

Son needed his daddy I still need him right now
He doin life in the Feds need that appeal right now
I catch a body I'm gone, I'm dipping right outa town
I see the scout who told he getting pelled right down
L's up to I die, blood, sweat, and some tears
Def Jam they signed me complete my dream as a kid
Got locked up told my celly, he thinking life is a gig
Tell'em all I'm on TV Mtv I'm the shit

I hit a stain on some bricks, I can't look back my head
I can't look back on this bread, I geuss diesease is to rare
One did and it spread YB64
All that riding is dead I put a nine to his head
[?] lawyer money I got him
If he can't hold weight he best believe I'm gonna spot'em
I can't sit in the streets and let my real niggas rotting
All black like I'm Bruce, so who think that was robbing

And they drop my advanced, I'm a cop me up six
I'm a carry a fenz and I'm a cop me a benz
I got Tommy's and Mac's, 40 cals, Glock 10's
Momma told me you gon make it but, you can't get it in
I'm a drop a [?] real niggas from actress
[?]
I'm on top of the city, so them rumors ain't matter
8 balls the size of baseballs in the feild I'm a batter
A nigga tried to kill me dead, ops tried to wheel me in
Like the Cubs in 79" them niggas won't win again

Judge told me eye to eye PD riding on her end
[?]
I can't change up like a penny, I won't head just like a penny
You won't catch in the telly, catch me in back of the billy
Niggas know I'm nailing shit, niggas know we killing shit
I don't really give a fuck all my niggas VVN'n
We be 30 deep at least 30 of us polled up
Taking risk that I hope and see my baby growing up

Russian roulette in the streets, life is all about luck
Pussy, money, weed, loalty, trust is what a nigga lust
I'm a I'm packing like a Green Bay Packer, all white challenger Saltine Cracker
Free all of my niggas doing more than 3 calenaders
Pigs snatched me up, smacked me up cause I ain't answer them

Can't snitch ain't a bone in my body say bitch
I can't switch, half them shooters say they shooting the faking
I'm savage, my teacher always said I wasn't average
She said lil Durk he'll shoot I remind them of the Maverick's
(Let's get it)</pre>
