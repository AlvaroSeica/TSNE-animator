[Chorus: Pusha T]
WOO! They said be all you can be
WOO! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie, I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever, I just wanna be who I am

[Pusha T]
WOO! They said be all you can be, nigga
WOO! They said be all you can be
Always knew I could rule the world, let's define what my world is
Knee deep in this dope money, damn near where my world ends
Same block, same rock, I was thinking 'bout murderin'
I ain't getting my hands dirty, let you worry 'bout servin' 'em

[Chorus: Pusha T] 
YAH! They said be all you can be
WOO! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie, I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna be dope forever, I just wanna be who I am
YAH! They said be all you can be
WOO! They said the truth set you free

[2 Chainz]
Entre-penuer, strip club, connoisseur (Tru)
Hot fudge, sundae, pour it on you, hallelujah 
Pour it on you, hallelujah; pour it on you, hallelujah
And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you-ah
Red, white, blue, I pledge allegence to the street life
Even if it's left overs I still got to eat right
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-popping her jeans tight, all day I dream about three stripes (yeah)
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool

[Pusha T]
WOO! They said be all you can be

[Big Sean]
Pretty girls is my reputation (yup), one on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to it, no hesitation to fuck with me you need a reservation
To the top escalatin', elevatin', G.O.O.D Music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going 'til I K.O (what); eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they roll (okay), even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him, all night and all day
and all night and all day, and all night like that shit's his mothafuckin' soulmate
Cause no time for hand in hand when you got this paper hand in hand
Bitch I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, nigga; na-na-na-na-na
Bitch I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, cause I still love to get pampered (boi)
But don't get it twisted, watch your step and fuckin' manners

[Pusha T]
WOO! They said the truth set you free!

[Chorus: Pusha T]
WOO! They said be all you can be
WOO! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie, I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna be dope forever, I just wanna be who I am
WOO! I just wanna be who I am
WOO! I just wanna be who I am
Always knew I could rule the world, lets define what my world is
Knee deep in this dope money, damn near where my world ends</pre>
