Song:   Stare Into the Mirror
Typed by: @DeejayKoss

Stare into the mirror now tell me what you lookin at
Writing rhymes about cookin crack when you shook in fact
Should never come in play when you are an emcee
You could find success with ya heart still empty
Be comfortable in ya own skin
The minute you don't do that all ya problems will begin
Livin life as a lie will provide you with headaches
Turn you into dead weight better get ya head straight
Yeah..Wrap it around this
there's a lil message in this here underground shit
And that message is being true to yaself
Worth more than any particular movement or wealth
Claim it but you aint put no dues in or help
got me tight like a hustler losin a sale
Think about puttin fake moves on the shelf
And watch how fast ya life begins to cruise &amp; prevail

Chorus
What is it you see when you look at your reflection
Do you see someone else from the lies your protecting
Well you're in for one hell of a fight
Because the truth always comes to light

Verse 2
Stare into the mirror now tell Me what you lookin at
Trying to be a gangsta gets you caught in central bookins black
That life you not about but you feel the need to glorify
Till the dramas at ya front door then you horrified
Screw up ya face get a crew of fakes qualified
Pistols come out and you cry like ya mamma died
Now was it really worth wiping your existence
You had to be a follower there ending won't be different
Them fellas that you see in them news paper clippings
They did it cause they had to do it who you think you kiddin
Being fake is transparent like a floor to cieling window
When I find the real you I'll be sure to let ya friends know
Mutual respect in life is elemental
Being someone else that really can prevent you
From finding the balance in life
Get rid of bad habits tonight
Get it right

Chorus
What is it you see when you look at your reflection
Do you see someone else from the lies your protecting
Well you're in for one hell of a fight
Because the truth always comes to light

Verse 3
Stare into the mirror now tell me what you lookin at
Follow whats on TV when you need to find a book in fact
I tell ya man that life's imaginary
It's funny till someone from ya family you bury
Being a snake is the rage in this day &amp; age
Nobodies being truthful the trend is playin games
Not sayin names but these verses that I lay in vain
Keeps the competition hot watch them stay in flames
Instead of watching what the next man do
You should really try and follow up that next plan through
But you don't too busy lookin from the porch man
Until you're a victim of ya own misfortune
Yet you still thinking ya fly but you're still as the parade goes by
I don't understand,but what I do know as a fact
Theres things in life that you can't take back

Chorus
What is it you see when you look at your reflection
Do you see someone else from the lies your protecting
Well you're in for one hell of a fight
Because the truth always comes to light</pre>
