[Verse 1]
Aeronautical activity is all grounded
No F16 jets no alarm sounded
Not even a rumour that a terrorist downed it
Without any hint of controversy around it
No police called everybody is accounted
Coverup unnecessary so no facts shrouded and,
Traffic grinds to halt leaving streets crowded and
the authorities don't know nothing about it
No little old ladies heard saying "oh my!" 
People getting later but not looking to know why
It's like suddenly the signs said 'Don't Drive'
Shouldn't someone worry the economy will nosedive?
The young and ambitious stop as life goes by
Cities that never sleep caught with a closed eye
Two year olds get ignored but fail to cry
By the side of their parents as they look up to the sky
And the seas would part and they'd part for you
I'd run anywhere to join you on a path for two and I
I don't wanna contemplate what I might do
And if I lose you I'll find you, I will find you

[Chorus: Mark Pearl - 2X]
Stop the clocks I'll walk away
Cos we've got something untamed
If what's beneath falls through
Then I'll fall, but I'll fall with you 

[Verse 2]
As if it never happened a computer went dead
We could fix this is what an technician would've said. 
Everything froze only one thing spared
e-mail spam's like cockroach eggs
People sat in cinemas where darkness glared
And analysed the blank space like architects
Systems stopped dead not even half a step
Dogs stopped barking not cos master said
A father paused reading to his daughter in bed
While a bloke stood around looking lost in his shed
doctors watched on as their patients bled
Their patients unfazed and intrigued by the red
For a second y'all suckers stopped trying to get cred 
and the West ceased pumping Islam full of led
Yeah the Goddamn world sat perched on the fence 
Even analysts hadn't figured out what it meant
It's why the seas part and they part for you
I'd ask that you join me on a path for two
I don't wanna ponder as to what I might do 
And if I lose you I'll find you, I will find you

[Chorus: Mark Pearl]
Stop the clocks I'll walk away
Cos we've got something untamed
If what's beneath falls through
Then I'll fall, but I'll fall with you 

Darling let's let them sleep
Come and lay next to me
Before we set them free
I wanna hear your heartbeat
{*2X*}

[Verse 3]
Finally some downtime due to the deadlock 
Electricity is cut back down to the bedrock
Hordes watch on as we walk by shellshocked
As if five billion waiting on a bellhop
We can whisper the things that we need to
a blanket of silence surrounds when it sweeps through 
The world'll hold on whether or not it agrees to
and it'll start again but I will never leave you

[Chorus: Mark Pearl - 2X]
Darling let's let them sleep
Come and lay next to me
Before we set them free
I wanna hear your heartbeat</pre>
