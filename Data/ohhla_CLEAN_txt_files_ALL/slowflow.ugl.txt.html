Uh-huh! Just relaxing!
Yeah, feels good
Uh-huh, kinda funky
Here we go!

[Dizzy Dustin] + (Andy Cooper)
It's half past eight and you're late for work
Your stopped in gridlock and you're going berserk (Uh-huh)
Put in overtime five days a week (Okay)
Pullin' out your hair for stress relief,
but you gotta compete so you get no sleep (Yup)
You want the good life but it don't come cheap (Nope!)
Climbin to the top of the totem pole,
you'll fall and break your neck man slow the flow

[Andy Cooper]
Now I'm from southern California, home of the laid back
We don't go lookin' for a needle in a haystack
And I say that in a subdued mood
Kick it on the beach, eat a little Mexican food
But you, I don't understand, what's the rush?
All flushed
Mad like you missed the bus
Another one's comin' in about ten minutes
Man you don't gotta push yourself to the limit

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
Slow the flow, relax your mind
Gain control, take your time
Slow the flow, relax your mind
Gain control, take your time

[Andy Cooper]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah!
(*Young Einstein cuts'n'scratches*)
"Slow the flow!" Uh-huh
"I like to let my rhymes flow!" - - &gt;Rakim
"Slow your flow!"

Relax, man - - &gt; Andy Cooper
"I like to let my rhyme flo-flo-flo-flow" - - &gt; Rakim
Dizzy Dustin! - - &gt; Andy Cooper

[Dizzy Dustin] + (Andy Cooper)
Forget about the weekdays, ready for the weekend
bring your swim trunks and jump into the deep end
(Stop!) for a minute or two and take a look at the view
I guarantee you'll see something new
We only have two seasons; summer and spring
So rock your flip flops and your cutoff jeans
If you live in Long Beach then you know that I mean
California dreamin' where it's all routine

[Andy Cooper]
A situation comes that so soon is past
and you'll catch whiplash movin (What?) so quick fast (Fast, fast, fast)
Fast, so fast, you risk breaking a limb
You're looking for satisfaction; mistaken again
King Solomon sang it's like chasin the wind,
You need to slow down start takin' it in
You need to slow down start takin' it in
You gotta slow down start takin' it in
You betta slow start takin' it in, start takin' it in

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
Slow the flow, relax your mind
Gain control, take your time
Slow the flow, relax your mind
Gain control, take your time
Slow the flow, relax your mind
Gain control, take your time
(I like to let my rhymes flow) - - &gt; Rakim
Slow the flow, relax your mind
Gain control, take your time

[Andy Cooper]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
In London, slow the flow
New York, slow the flow
Shanghai, slow the flow
In Berlin, slow the flow
In Tokyo, slow the flow
Rio De Janeiro, slow the flow
In Sydney, slow the flow
Moscow, slow the flow
In Seoul, slow the flow
Long Beach, you don't keep it slow!
(Oh yeah, say what) Let's get outta here!
(Yeah, oh yeah, say what? Yeah, oh yeah, say what? Yeah..)

And one, a two, three, four, five, a six
A seven, a eight (Yeah!)
Here are some of the ways we survive (Alright!)
There's always shoplifting at the ?
Pay for a pack of gum and steal a steak
Or insecurity is too close by (What you going do?)
Eat the cheese right there
I said enterprise, you got to enterprise, enterprise
You got to enterprise, ?
Bicycle stealing, used to be (used to be), good until the syndicate got all in it
But you can now and then...</pre>
