[Fes Taylor]
Aiyo, son, I've been shot before, bullet came
Right out my chest, but I ain't drop to the floor
Tied my shirt around my chest, put pressure on my wound
Couldn't picture myself, on the stretcher or in the tomb
Jetted straight to the crib, son, knocking on the door
Mom's opened up, wished she had forgot what she saw
Her son bleeding to death, damn near on his last breath
Blood trail follow me, all the way to the last step
My earth too hysterical to drive, but if I would of waited
For the ambulance, I felt I would of died
I'm in the backseat, gasping for air, asking the lord
Don't take me, this ain't fair
Pulled off in front of St. Vincent's, I tried to walk out the car
I fell to the floor, I thought I saw God, but
It was the face of the doctor, they was cutting me open
Sticking tools in me, blood overflowing
I heard the doctor say "he's gon' live, put him in I.C.U."
My moms felt the weight more than I did
I'm laid up in the bed, with a oxygen mask
Blood in my lungs, son, plus my asthma is bad
I said, you don't really know my pain
I said, you don't really know my pain, you gon' feel my struggle
Cuz you don't really know my pain
I said, you don't really know my pain, you gon' feel my struggle
Cuz you don't really know my pain
I said, you don't really know my pain, you gon' feel my struggle
Cuz you ain't never felt my pain
I said, you ain't never felt my pain, it's part of the struggle, yeah</pre>
