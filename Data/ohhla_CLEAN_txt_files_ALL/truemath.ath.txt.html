[Intro]
Shawty, shawty!
{Three, two, one} "WOW!"

[Atherton]
One is the word that give to the lonely
Also the number they plant on their best
Two is the time that the bar will be closing
and minimum persons required for sex
Three is a crowd but I say it ain't so!
Three in my crowd it don't feel like a show
But you'll +four+feit the dough, five bills guaranteed
if not keep six, this promoter gon' bleed

[CHORUS]
I can do numbers, I can do that
I can I can do that, yeah I can do math
I can do numbers, I can do that
I can I can do that, yeah that's the true math
I can do numbers, I can do that
I can I can do that, yeah I can do math
I can do numbers, I can do that
1 - Even though I never made it past grade ten class
2 - The countdown to the break baby shake yo' "WOW!"

[Atherton]
All I wanted as a young kid growing up was
a calculator watch considered them really cool
But I was told NO and knowing that dream was snuffed
I wrote raps instead during that portion of school
So my time tables might be all outta wack
like 2x2 is "hey fuck you"
but that's just because I'm upset over the fact 
that pencil pushing accountants are getting more food
Like - where's my plate? Where's my steak yo
Where'd they go oh - they already ate great
I'll tip this scale with math I know
Atherton + rap = tracks dipped in gold
24K music x word of mouth praise
is a much better world for your kids to be raised
Ok ok now I just divide and subtract
the wackness no remainder, and that's that

[CHORUS]
