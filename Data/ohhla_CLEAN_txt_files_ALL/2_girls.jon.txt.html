Typed by: AZ Lyrics

How do you show someone you love
That they are the one
So many ways to express love
It's hard to choose just one
How you gonna do it

Some people like to kiss, some people like to hug
Some lesbians like eating each others shit out of a cup
Some people say "I love you," some even shout it out
Some people puke semi-digested shit into each others mouths

Sometimes making love's not enough
You have to step it up
And urinating on her face
Is not enough to say "I love you"

Some people like to kiss, some people like to hug
Some lesbians like eating each others shit out of a cup
Some people say "I love you," some even shout it out
Some people puke semi-digested shit into each others mouths

She's covered in vomit and human feces
That's how I know that she needs me
[3x]

Shit in my mouth, and I'll puke it all over your face
(I love you)</pre>
