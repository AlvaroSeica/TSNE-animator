[Truck]
Yo, I'm about to make it hot up in here, take off your clothes like Nelly
This is a stick up, throwing shots through your telly
Man, you know the routine, nigga, lay on your belly
Fuck a mask, shit is real, so I'm keeping it gully
Yo, aight, listen up, the real mack is back
And I'm trying to cop a truck, same color as crack
But for now I'm on the block, off god damn later
In front of Ox man store, on these God damn crates
I might laugh with you, even smoke a blunt with you
But when my pockets is low, I'm coming to get you
Chasing you down with this rusty ass pistol
My gun remind me of Billy the Kid
Cuz my, gun did shit that Billy done did
It's like, it held me down when the beef was on
I'll pop you, leave you leaking like an ink alarm
And fuck you, if you think I'm wrong
The type of shit that I know I'm on, choke you
By your neck, while your link still on, and slide off
In a cherry red Navi' Lincoln, oh shit

[Interlude: Apocalipps]
Fuck ya'll niggas wanna do
Let's wake this shit up now
Ruthless Bastardz up in here
It's gon' be trouble
Ya'll better get it crunked now
I gotta ask ya'll something
Yo, yo

[Apocalipps]
Aiyo, I gotta spray the lead off, treat you like my first P
I joe dog, straight pop ya fucking head off
The shotgun'll leave you slump and dimished
I know some, young punks that'll dump in the Plymouth
And we don't, smoke blunts, we blow hundreds of spinach
And ya'll, cowards ain't down, ya'll faggots is finished
And I be, serving rappers like Serena in tennis
And when you not at home, I'm up in your lab stealing your 10 inch
The nozzle of my gun is long, it's like 10 inch
I snatch ya pendant, then cold clap your co-defendant
The garbage niggas, ya'll be wasting beats
I put the burner on your tongue, and make you taste the heat
I build techs and fire the four, and I'm not a electrician
But I bet you, I can wire your jaw
Now all my mommy's taking dick in the ass, get ya freak on
And all my niggas blowing that dust, get your leak on
And ya'll keep on, and, I'mma get my creep on
To make you intercept the bullet like Jason Seahorn
Now be gone, go 'head, get the fuck out my face
Burn it up, before I burn you, put a hole in your face

[Beno]
Be, ready for war, when I'm at your door
Cock the four, first to ask, drop to the floor
Who wanna play Sugar Ray, take a shot to your jaw
Come back, second round if you want some more
Ahh, that's what I thought, that hole, that's my fault
I sware you wasn't thug, when you ran up in the club
Should of known something different when you started coughing blood
If you from the street, nigga, blaze ya heat, nigga
How you want beef, nigga, don't eat meat, nigga
Mess with me, nigga, better say a prayer
Put something in your head, mess up your pretty hair
Got ya'll pretty scared, when we come on blocks
Cuz when we come through, yo, we let off shots

[Iron Mic]
Yo, we don't pop collars, we pop toast for them dollars
Street knowledge, coming to take what's ours
Keep the nine polished, stay the fuck back
Trust me, my gun ain't rusty, leave you laying up, black
All I do is sell crack, bust a gat and rap
Alotta niggas talk about it, they don't really did that
Half of the shits that you talking, me and my niggas did that
I ain't gotta front, for you, this nigga, or this cat
Pistol black, we spit murder on wax
Keep ya eye on your dough, nigga, we bout to snatch that
We them guys on the low, you don't wanna glance that
Burning bottles of 'dro, yelling, nigga pass that
We them starving grimey cats, you talk about in your rhyme
We them niggas that'll fuck you up, you get out of line
We them niggas that's shutting it down, game's over
Guns bust off of sober, til I reach my quota</pre>
