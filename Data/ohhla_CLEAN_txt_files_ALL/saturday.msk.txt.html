Song:   Saturday
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's the weekend
Time to cruise it en la noche
Gotta get lista in a way que solo yo se
Tryin to get a little sexy for the kick back
No need to step up my game, homie, I relax
So now I hop into a dark blue impala
I'm feeling nasty tonight, I'm feeling mala
Highway speeding con volumen
Play me some reyes urbano some of that new shit
Because tonight I wanna lose all the tension
And all I'm really trying to get is some attention
Drink up the pisto with the gente
And think about all the good times we had while inconscientes
Like the times, kicking back at the studio
When Malhablado [?] that I was beautiful
And I remember the time some vato came
And they thought that I invited him along
What could I say?

[CHORUS]
I can't wait
(No no I can't wait)
For Saturday
(And you know [?])
So I can't wait
(I've been waiting all night for you)
So come and play
(Come and chill with me)

[PAYASO]
Now everybody knows how Payaso rolls
Step out the cadillac sportin' gangster clothes
I don't love them hoes but I can't get enough of 'em
You got it twisted if you think I'm spending bucks on 'em
I get 'em sprung with the cruising oldies
They can't resist these bald-headed homies
Tats in my skin, put the needle in
Ey, Lil' Fly Boy, let the games begin
[FLY BOY]
From the top to the bottom, homie, bottom to the top
Fly Boy, South East San Diego on the map
See I made it to here, dog, I'm all about my chips
If you fuck with my hustle, I introduce you to my fist
I roll with the dogs, I don't fuck with the kitties
One nine zero four, Gotta represent the city
Top knotch woman in Cali, sunshine
Gotta get dressed, homie, cause you know I'm getting mine

[CHORUS]
I can't wait
(No no I can't wait)
For Saturday
(And you know [?])
So I can't wait
(I've been waiting all night for you)
So come and play
(Come and chill with me)

El fin de semana que mas puedo yo decir
En el estudio con mi raza que mas puedo yo pedir
Todo calmado porque aqui todos somos familia
Respeto es lo que sobra [?] es nuestra vecina
I got the homie Malhablado lacing up the track
And with the vato ejecutivo [?] fuck
Damn, I wish that I could say
I'm chilling with the homie Dos Caras from around the way
Fast Lane and Abusivo, don't forget La Sinfonia
Tico and Mr. V and Vanessa, mi amiga
You know, I keep it simple, so I take these vacaciones
To do a couple shows y escribir varias canciones
So I deal with what's real, ain't no fucking shit up
Saturday night, cruising it, homies saying what's up
[?]

[CHORUS]
I can't wait
(No no I can't wait)
For Saturday
(And you know [?])
So I can't wait
(I've been waiting all night for you)
So come and play
(Come and chill with me)
I can't wait
For Saturday
I can't wait
So come and play</pre>
