[Intro]
Hard liquorrrrr
Me and my people be so drunk we don't drive
We take the trolley 'cause of
Hard liquorrrrr
We started Waldo to Westport
and pee in every martini corner at the last call
And we all yellin' "Is there any more?"
When it ain't we go home for
Hard liquorrrrr
Make sure that it's mixed
yeah
And twist it with a little bit of lemon juice on ice
get drunk
on ice
get drunk
on ice
get drunk motherfucker get drunk
yeahhh

[Tech N9ne]
Aye aye
they sayin' that I got high blood sugar
So I can't drink like I wanna drink
drink like I wanna know
I ain't playin 'cause I love liquor
So if I big drink am I gonna drink, jinxed, I don't wanna go
So I go hard as hell on one night, fun sight
If I'm drunk enough to start a bum fight Done right
Henny, Jack and Gin, 151 Rum slight, none light
Novocaine I know to blame a gun snipe on drunk life
then the bar hit ya with a large spritzer
Hit ya ass, get ya cash then they all richer
in the draw, pitcher
I'm large sipper
When you wait betta hope I aint in the car with ya

what the fuck
hey yo Whoo Kid run that shit back
god damn!
