What the fuck wrong with these niggaz mayn
Can't be mad, cause your bitch all over here looking at a playa mayn
Shit you know the rules, your bitch chose me
We can handle this like some gentlemen
Or we can get into some gangsta shit, but I know
You don't want that mayn, hey check it out mayn (Killa)

[Kyleon]
Don't start no shit, it won't be no shit
Can't be mad at me, if you see your chick
All inside my car, like she my bitch
She just hear the performance, she see my dick
Shit, your bad if you wife the hoe
Tell you the truth, she not even my type of hoe
I'm just fucking her, I don't even like the hoe
I just call her to fuck, and she like to go
She a good looking broad, but she a trifling hoe
Cars clothes and jewelry, what entice the hoe
My partna Dre Day, was just with her the night befo'
Ron, D, B we all sliced the hoe
You can't convince me, and try to say this bitch not a bop
When everybody with a lil' change, got a shot of cot
You spend a dime to hit, I spit a line to hit
When it's my time to split, you run behind the chick
Shit, I'ma just let you spoil the hoe
But when it's my time to fuck, let me borrow the hoe mayn

(*talking*)
Ha-ha, that's real mayn
Bring the hook in

[Hook]
I just wanna know
If you sipping behind her, please just let me know
So I can keep on hitting, while she take your do'
I can't believe you, try to make a housewife out a hoe
But you still love her
And you, will not let her go

(*talking*)
Simp ass nigga mayn
What the fuck wrong with you mayn
You just really thought, this bitch
Was gon see a nigga doing it
And she was gon keep fucking with you man
Dee-Wee man, we gotta tell these niggaz man
They need to quit simping, behind these bitches mayn
You gotta love her or leave her alone man, run it
And them niggaz really be thinking
That shit cool too mayn, man you know I've been
Fucking with that hoe for the longest
I've been spending all kinda bread, crazy ass nigga

[Kyleon]
A simp nigga, just make me scream
When he catch his chick cheating, wanna make a scene
Putting his hands all on her, wanna beat the hoe
Yeah she wrong but, that ain't how you treat the hoe
You don't beat a bitch up, cause she fucking around
You ain't married, just start fucking the town
There's plenty fish in the sea, just move to the next
Cause you ain't losing your life, you just losing some sex
It's up to you, to kill confusion and plex
You can't make a bitch love you, by using your checks
Cause in the end, she ain't loving you
She just infatuated, with all the shit you do
Now do you feel me (nope), well back up man
That's when I step in, as the back up plan
Now that's when, your relationship's through
Cause that's what chicks, in a fucked up relationship do
