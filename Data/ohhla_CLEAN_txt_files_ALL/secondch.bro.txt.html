[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, keep bouncin
Uh, uh, uh, keep bouncin
Uh, uh, uh, keep bouncin
Uh, uh, uh, keep bouncin

[Chorus: Bilal]
They say don't give second chances
But ain't nobody gon' make me feel like you do
(Dooooooo, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooooooh)
And I know that this ain't perfect
But I still felt like it's worth it
Cause I love you (Yoooooooou, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh oooooh)

[Rapper Big Pooh]
All of my friends keep tellin me
I need to pack it up, stay movin
I need to weigh the good and the bad
If the bad prevails then I need to stop losin
I keep choosin this pain, sayin
to myself, "It's only time 'fore it all start to change"
I ain't tryna hear it, so my mind rearrange
All your opinions don't constitute change
Even though we bring the worst out each other
She countered back we the best undercovers
But undercovers can't save, us
from fussin and fightin, arguin for days
I'm gettin tired of this wave of emotion
Back and forth, up and down, rollercoastin
I like my ship sail smooth in the ocean
But this a perfect storm where I don't mind motion

[Chorus]

[Darien Brockington]
Everybody's telling me that I should be the one
to up and walk away from what we have together
Tried to replace you baby 
But I just can't leave you alone 
(So many have tried, tried to get next to me)
But ain't nobody who can love me quite like you

[Phonte]
Uh, nobody quite like, you
cause we go way back like Excitebike
I mean further than that, I'm talkin Lite Brites
Through all the ups and downs, you were the highlight
Saturday morning beauty parlors, gettin highlights
Tellin your girls I should straighten up and fly right
Cause when the times gets leaner, other grass seem to have a greener hue
Look away but don't lose sight when I'm into you

[Chorus]

[Interlude] (Darien Brockington)
Uh, uh, uh, keep bouncin
Uh, uh, uh, keep bouncin (It ain't perfect, Lord knows)
Uh, uh, uh, keep bouncin
Uh, uh, uh, keep bouncin (It is so worth it to me)

[Phonte]
Y'know, you used to tell me I was a lot different 
than a average nigga.. and I guess that's true
cause by now the average nigga woulda been packed his shit and got the hell on
Shit, I thought about it
I just never could through with it, though
I don't know, maybe I'm just stupid feeling that way
But, y'know, maybe it's something a lil' deeper
Like, yaknahmsayin, like yo I remember the first time
yaknahmsayin, we went out. nigga was so broke we had the $5 date nights
Remember that? We get two double cheeseburgers from the dollar menu
Then get tickets to the $1.50 movie? Teh..
I guess it's shit like that that y'know.. 
the average woman ain't gon' understand just from seein a nigga in a magazine
I can't do this without you, baby

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Uh, uh, uh, keep bouncin
Uh, uh, uh, keep bouncin   </pre>
