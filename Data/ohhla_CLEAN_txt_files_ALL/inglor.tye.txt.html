{Well Tyler uhh, it's about that time}
{I mean, you're a good kid, just misguided}
{Now is um, is there anything that you want to}
{say before, we end this?}

My father died the day I came out of my mother's hole
and left a burden on my soul until, I was old enough
to understand that the fuckin faggot didn't like me much
He loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he shake Junt
Bring your pops to school today for 12 years I cheated
Told the fuckin faculty that he was at a meeting and
Bring that dude to life day, he wasn't at the meeting
Made a U-turn on the way there like "The fuck am I thinking?"
Birthdays, Christmas my only fuckin wishlist
was CD's (and a father) and a new fitted instead
I got some CD's I hated, some Ritalin, some white socks
I was hyper cause I ain't get attention from my real pops
Cops say I'm supposed to be, in jail but they don't know it's me
Statistics say that niggaz with no father ain't gon' be shit (nigga)
Well I guess I had one because nigga I'm it
You smell that? That's the odor of success bitch

[Interlude]
I know I'm not the only bastard... in America
So I'm going to need some help, on this next part
Scream it with me niggaz

[Chorus]
Fuck you (I'm good) fuck you (I graduated)
Without you (I'm good) fuck you (I'm good)
Nigga 18 (I'm good) fuck you (I'm good)
Got a car nigga (fuck you) eat a dick nigga, bitch

Father's Day was the worst when it came to gifts
cause I ain't know for who or what the fuck to get
Now my momma mentioned the day before what she would like
Cause she's playingboth roles like her occupation was dyke, fuckin right~!
I ain't look up to Obama and Nixon
I look up to the Hugos and Dixons
The niggaz in the vision rap about the shit they cookin in the kitchen
Pushin ki's like them niggaz that were banging on the keys
My father never seen me, the nigga probably Stevie
He bought me a hoodie, a couple albums
Like that's gonna make up for the years and the tears
and the money that my momma spent on rent and clothes
You fuckin dipped out, I swear to God if I see you
I'ma get out the M-16 and let a fuckin clip out
Cause in 16 years, you let your kid down the existence, none
I don't give a fuck either like father, like son, I'm done

[Hodgy Beats]
He ain't give a fuck about me
He ain't give a fuck about you
He ain't give a fuck about we
So what the fuck we gon' do?

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
The cold is nice, and I'm not talkin about the weather
The skin is thick, no need for leather
Your father called he said you're better, without him
I'm not the only fuck without them
How to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed up
Take it to the shop, then what?
Fuck it, momma's proud of her asthmatic thin fuck
Luck on my brim Supreme keeps me warm
when the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer
The bummer is the fact that I'm black
And I hang with white Neos who's Nero stays frio
Now this counselor is trying to tell me that I'm emo
She don't give a fuck; D-low where's the trigger?
I'll let this bullet play hero...

[Outro]
Shit
Fuck, no fuck that
Fuck that, I ain't deserve this
Over it... BANG~!!</pre>
