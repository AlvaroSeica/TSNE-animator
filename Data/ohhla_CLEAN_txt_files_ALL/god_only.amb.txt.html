[Otis]
Did I really take her and keep her with me?
Cover her face up so she couldn't breathe?
Cut her eyeballs out so she couldn't see?
I still feel like she is looking at me.
Brought her to the basement and took off her clothes
Did I do the right thing?
God only knows!

[Chorus - 4X]
Maybe I was only wondering if I could open up your body
Take your heart out and consume

("God only knows!" throughout chorus)

[Otis]
Am I really like this? Is this really me?
Am I really the person I want to be?
Is it this life that has created me?
Am I a product of society?
Did I really eat pills cause everything's fucked?!
Can I fall asleep and just never wake up?!!

[Chorus - 4X]
Maybe I was only wondering if I could open up your body
Take your heart out and consume

("God only knows!" + "Never wake up!" throughout chorus)</pre>
