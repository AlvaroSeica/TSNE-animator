[Verse 1]
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go cause they don't hold back
So all you fill the streets, it's appealin' to see
You won't get out the county cause you're bad and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they gotta kiss it because I don't get
sleep
No

[Hook]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Learn forever hand in hand
Take it all, let on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Verse 2]
Laughing gas these hasmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Ladies, homies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in heart of this here
Care bear reppin' in heart of this here
Watch me as I gravitate
ha HA ha HA
Yo we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the place
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound you kill the Inc
So don't stop, get it get it
Until you're cheddar header
Watch the way I navigate
ha HA ha HA

[Hook]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Learn forever hand in hand
Take it all, let on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Outro]
Don't stop, get it get it
We pirate captains in it
Steady, watch me navigate
ha HA ha HA
Don't stop, get it get it
We pirate captains in it
Steady, watch me navigate
ha HA ha HA</pre>
