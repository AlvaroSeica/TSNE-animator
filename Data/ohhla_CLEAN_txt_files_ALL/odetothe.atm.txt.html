This is an ode to the modern man
It's the ode to the modern man
This is the ode to the modern man
Word up, this is the modern man
This is that ode to the modern man
This goes out to that modern man
This is the ode to the modern man
It's to the modern man, lightning blend

Word to B E, I'm a tad bit too easy on self
And maybe I should keep a closer tab on my health
I suppose that it's simple as said and completed
I thought me to attack but in fact again retreated, completed
This word search crumbled it up and ate it
My hunger for my blue-collar heaven keeps me sedated
Escaped it, last night in a dream
And now I sleep, with a flashlight and it seems to keep
The nightmare demons and semen-laced portions parallel and apart
Like Stephen's Avenue in Portland
A much traveled one way, or a slow residential
And if the camels don't stop me I'm a grow with my pencil
Once I climb the skulls of this MC graveyard
I'll see the sun again, I'll jump and run again
So come on over visit cause I got a lot to say
And tell Stress I ain't mad, cause I got my way
But my man Spawn's here now, so I'm a make it brief
Finish up my coffee, gather up my shit and leave
I got an army of peers we fight single-handed
And I won't damage your brain until I understand it

[Spawn]
You have only one chance to advance to the next stage I'm at
Do you really think you actually will pass through
I have to ask you, did you see what happened to the last dude
Tried to compare styles, word he got his ass chewed
Now with this in mind, do you still wanna bring your shit and find out the hard way
Spawn's not the one to play with, trade blades with
You might as well split your own wrist with the razor
It's best cause I'm crazier
Blazing you, for my own amusement
In tune wit your body, when I split your whole fixture
This is what happens when you're on my shit list-er
Brains to give a blister, so next time you call me sir or mister
It's the word-twister tongue used to make the verbs hit ya
Now do you get the fucking picture?
Well if you, gotta see me you better call up
Cause my behavior blows kids away like a tall wind
I take you all in between my jaws for consumption
MC's and coffee at my luncheon
One or two lumps, and some cream, call the team for the gathering
Bring mics and turntables lets do our thing

[Slug]
Ha, cause it's an ode to that modern man
This is that ode to the modern man
Yeah, this goes out to that modern man
From Minneapolis St. Paul to that modern man
And it's like a dedication to that modern man
This one here, this is for that modern man
From Atmosphere goin' out to that modern man
It's to that modern man, lightning blend

[Slug]
What, now for the umpteenth-time we kick rhymes about something
Can't front, I'm frustrated with heads that don't listen
My positions off-balance
It's a constant challenge between the talents and the underlying mission
I can fill your head sore with metaphors, some cute catch-phrases
Filtered through accessible things
But if I don't stay sincere to love and hate
How do I differentiate between chasing cream and chasing dreams
Oh yeah, fuck an MC in my city that wants to diss me
If I was to bounce to Atlanta with Shocker y'all would miss me
So kiss me, smack dab on the asshole while you battle
I'm with your wife sharing a Newcastle
Big up to Gene Pool cause he's the modern man
Word up, that kid Abuse, that kids a modern man
To Self-One, yo, that kids a modern man
Full Circle, you know them kids is modern men
The Native Ones, word up to that modern man
Beyond Extreme, this one goes to the modern man
The Dynospectrum out to that modern man
From Atmosphere goes out to that modern man
Word up this is the ode to the modern man
It goes, like, one time for that modern man
This goes out here now to that modern man
It's to that modern man, it's to that modern man
Y-yo, this is the ode to the modern
It goes word-up to that modern man
It's for that modern man, its for that modern man
It's for that modern man lightning blend</pre>
