Rainman! Something for the ladies... And the fellas
(Little something... little message)
Check it out

[Verse 1]
First up I send a shout out to the woman in here
Whether sipping mixed drinks or guzzling beer
Whether they're as sober as a judge or stoned as fuck
Here for the music or just to get drunk
If you came with your man or came as a fan
If ya, came with your girlfriends to the jam
If ya, here at a hip hop show for the first time
Or you've been checking out gigs since 89'
If you spend your spare time writing rhymes
Or if you're a student studying design
If ya here cos your friends playing tonight
Or you've been thinking about rocking that open mic
Whatever brought you here, I hope you feel at home
I hope you know that it's not only a bloke zone
It's just as much your place, your space
You got every right to come here and feel safe

[Chorus]
Attention (attention) gentlemen (gentlemen)
Who do you think you are?
"Grabbing girls in clubs"
"Hate to be around that shit"
