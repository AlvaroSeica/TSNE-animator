[Chorus: Kevlaar 7]
From back yards and boulevards, Avenues and crews
Restin under street lamps we distribute the news
After the death we the last ones left
Came from nothin and made something
Rulers of fact, God bless

[Kevlaar 7]
Yo, You gotta love it, Honest we got the globe on it
The money I tuck it, Fuck it and roll the dice
Acknowledged by the illest, My people divide and find difference
Niggas roll by in a black bullet proof tinted
Squinted mean, Flash the peace sign, Absentees seen
Splash graffiti in the riveen, Explore my lean
Skin my cold heart, Split DutchÂ’s, Spittin in a fiend
Laboratory scene, Speed hunger, These street respect
Get vexed at the rookies rockin on plat they neck
Imagine that, My body jealous of my own shadow
Cause he can disappear so narrow, Substantial
I hold a manual with one arm across my lumbar
Gambles with granules, Be have'n our wrist at chrome handles
Vandals what they call our taggin artists
Regardless, We modern day Marin's
Struggle men re-invent what's goin on as we puff the double mint

[Chorus]

[Kevlaar 7]
You gotta love it, Escape from the plantation gunnin
Too much of anything will lead you to nothin
Trustin my judgment, I'm from an era
None is compared to no other trade mark, It's real or rare'r
Shorties laugh in the distance, As dark as it is
Shouldn't them kids be in the crib use'n pencils and pens
Fucked up as it is, It's all kill til we live
Fill the cup with the fifth, Yo let it stick to your ribs
Boulevard wisdom, Don't spill his organs, Come inside this portrait
Orphans in yard benches, Organize and give offerings
Onyx tinted bullet proof cruise by again
Blue lights wipe, The priest just flicked them
Instantly witnesses marched upon the premises
Insist on no breeding, Envy, It could've been me
Once a poor seed regardless, We modern day Martin's
Fatherless dreams, This method is historic

[Chorus]

[Outro: Kevlaar 7]
Yeah, God bless, Word up</pre>
