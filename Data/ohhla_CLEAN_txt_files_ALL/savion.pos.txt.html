[P.O.S.]
Yo, so when they can't stop, won't stop, who keeps the tank topped?
Who reaps the good sleep, keeps the receipts?
I see 'em sucking up the last drops, drop-top H2
Stretch H3, where the party at, democrat?
Sitting on a muggy summer bench, sipping muddy water
Peeping Newsweek and see what's up with Sergeant Slaughter
Hotter days on the way, turn your A.C. Slater up
Burn Aloe Vera green, apple now and later? yup
Pass that sweet, Mike Mictlan, where the mask at?
Hand over what? Hand over yours, run that
Man overboard with the same cracked frown
Dehumanize communities like Black Hawk Down
They realise immunities, then rape them towns
So we speak our mind so fluently with raw rap sounds
Alright tykes, a Klondike bar's on the line
We need a blind eye turned, keep it simple, refined
for the black gold Texas tea, ha, you're kidding
Ain't been good oil in Texas for a minute
That's why we knocked over our thrones and watch it combust
End up in free speech zones, that shock and awe was on us
Watch me expat Brazilian
if eighty-five per cent in Guantanamo is civilian
Blood pumps vermilion, beats dump all over the chump populace
keeping they focus on Paris Hilton
Prada dead, guilty as any Internet threads
Big check, probably got a lot of bad head
All night vision, all night missions, all right
Christ risen? Tight, nope, call the prisons, yikes
Middle picking the simple drivel
The riddle's a head ripper, suburbanites gonna get the kibble
Yeah, the double speak is legit
They on some "Stand up for yourself, you worthless piece of shit"
Bet it all, lose it all, forget it
And saying "Fuck Bush" gave that douche a splash too much credit
But smoking on kush make cats who apathetic
Can't beat 'em with a bat, so we join 'em and spit the ethic
Or, beat 'em with a bat, P.O.S. steadily wreck it
for anybody who raps or naps on facts
Fill the inline six to End Hits
The oval office and the lobby probably listen to Fugazi singing
"This one's ours, let's take another"
"This one's ours, let's take another"
"This one's ours, let's take another"
And then they dance away clean like Savion Glover</pre>
