Song:   Get it How U Get It
Typed by: Tha Masta

[Chorus: Fes Taylor]
Aiyo, I don't knock ya hustle, get it how u get it then
Yo, me and my boys dividin' up these dividends
What I'm drivin' in, what I'm livin' in
They say we guiltiest 'til we proven innocent
I don't knock ya hustle, get it how u get it then
Yo, me and my boys dividin' up these dividends
What I'm drivin' in, what I'm livin' in
They say we guiltiest 'til we proven innocent

[Pa Bazil]
Imparticular, the flow perpendicular
The homicide vehicular whenever I make hits a run
On impulse, I tell you to get ya gun
That's the only way you gon' ever get Big Pun
For God's sake, who spit it harder on the tape?
I'm the horror that awaits, all tomorrows are erased
Yeah, he like that calm inside a case
You could hear somethin' tickin', you shake it, it detonates
Carefully crafted, all hail to the slasher
Some tried to beat it but failed, and couldn't pass ya
To all you rappers movin' calm, tight fashioned
Y'all don't want a problem with Pa, ya scare tactics
Man practice, share action
Everybody wantin' to see what the man packin'

[Chorus]

[L.I.S.]
Explicit lyrics is what I'm givin'
Take a seat behind the board to make sure you hear it
Want a sample from the 4? Call ya boy to clear it
They say it come from the soul but I spit it from the spirit

[Lon Dini]
Savagely save circuits, plus certain I could burn you
Brutally beats and bang 'em way down into Beijing
Burners is pulled and pussies get popped on arrival
Destroy the shit daily with flows so wicked that it scares me

[Fes Taylor]
I'm back with my new rap, I tried out on Hip Hop Lovers
I gotta chew threw a ziplock hunger
I play the bunker like a true soldier, the new cobra
Two Rovers, listed, we came from Boost Mobiles
I used to shoot off SOHO, now we global
Right through the toll booth, serve 'em like Soul Food
Remember Doug Fresh, Slick Rick, the old crew?
Now it's LIS, Fes, Pa, Dini and the whole crew
Platinum jewels, even got 'em in gold too
So the pigs stay eye-ballin' when they roll through

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, yo, yo, nann nigga do it like Deck
You gon' find it a hard time to get my hands off of ya neck
Fuck the radio, the corner respect
And I handle my delf, by my delf without callin' my set
And if I gotta start callin' for back, y'all could call it a wrap
A hundred guns and clips up from the Stat
I ain't worried about catchin' a rap
I'm a two-time felon, I ask "Why?" after the fact
You know only dime Misses attract
And my niggaz in black mosh with it, causin' triggers to clap
And even if you don't listen to rap
I still be on ya head like a fitted cap, spittin' that
A tenth of the strength I pack, the inf. I pack
Graveshiftin' in the trench, I'm strapped
Two 4, that's my fam, that's fact, understand that, black
We got the hood like "Damn, that's crack!"
