There's no story that ain't been told
There's no gimmick that ain't been sold
Ain't no ocean that ain't been swam
Ain't no JOBBER that ain't been slammed
There's no road that never been travled
There's no doctor that ain't been baffled
Ain't no thug that never cried
Ain't no preacher that never lied
There's no rumor that ain't been passed
Ain't no question that no one's asked
There's no trees that ain't been chopped
There's no bomb that wont get dropped
Ain't no paths that no one's been laid
Ain't no beast that ain't been afraid
No feat that no one can
There's no saga that never began

Ain't no snow that didn't melt
There's no punch that ain't been felt
There's no skill that no one's learned
There's no planet that He ain't turned
There's no view that never dissolved
There's no problem that ain't been solved
There's no tail that no one's told
There's no beauty that won't get old
There's no garden that the sun ain't beamed on
There's no shoulder that ain't been leaned on
There's no color that ain't been seen
Purple Red Yellow Blue Forest Green
There's no desert that ain't seen rain
Nobody here that ain't felt pain
There's no bigot that ain't been clowned
There's no treasure that I ain't found
Ain't no gate they never explored
Ain't no mother that ain't been ignored
There's no leader that ain't been lead
There's no blood that ain't been shed
There's no dish they never made
No brick they never laid
Everything left's been done before
Nothings new, nowhere to explore

On the day when the wagon's come I just pray that you let me on (7x)
Wont you let me on, Wont you let me on, Wont you let me on.....

Hey Jake Jeckel fly twist and spin to the other side(9x)
On the day when the wagon's come I just pray that you let me on
Wont you let me on, Wont you let me on...</pre>
