[Chorus: Last Emperor]
Now if I loved you would you love me back?
Would you confess that I was the best that you've ever had?
Would you allow me to hold you, show you exotic lands?
Well there's no need to look any further, you got your man

[The Last Emperor]
Turn off the lights, let me close the door
Two bodies, one common cause, a million ways to explore
Would you be willin' to be Emperor's tool and Emperor's raw
Stop frontin', come to something you've never felt before
Now I got it, never let another take it from me
You need it, I can see it, I can tell by the way you touch me
Long for me when I'm gone although while thinkin' of me
Allow me one moment in time, I'ma make you love me

[Chorus]

[The Last Emperor]
What is it you desire Your Highness? Ask, I'll listen
Someone above the average thug, a man, a vision
Let me be your knight in shinin' armour, a man with riches
Be the Genie of ya magic lamp, I'll grant your wishes
Play the starring roll, be the leading actor
Let me be the Mark Anthony to your Cleopatra
Your only protector, once I got ya, let me at ya
Quicken your pulse, have your heart beatin' faster
Be the master of your happiness to keep it all
Be the spouse, come and live in my house, it be your home
Would you accept as sacred or hate it, leave me alone
Or love it like Mike Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones

[Chorus]

[The Last Emperor]
Ya couldn't find another guy to satisfy ya every need
Every dimension inch of the earth and the Seven Seas
I'm that person, end your searchin' cause I got what you need
???????, ain't no problem just follow my lead
Come my direction, under my protection I'll take you there
No question, my loves perfected, yeah you can say it's rare
Love makin', we shares a moment that's frozen in time
I know how to treat my lady and baby I'm goin' for mines
Here to conquer, defend your honour and fight your bouts
Would you let me know the intimate things you think about
You gotta make me a father, come on and just have my child
Stop the procrastinatin' and waitin', lets it now

[Chorus] x2</pre>
