[D-Sisive]
It's time to believe in something
Preach to the weak and hungry
Speak to these evil beats that
beat out these speakers pumping, rattling bones
Six feet below, to the souls that are free above me
Time to believe in something
Speak to the meek and ugly, I'm here to love thee
Creed, with "Arms Wide Open," hug me
It's time to believe in something
Elbows touch, never run behind me
Forward march, never duck like Flying V
The mighty giant's eyelids
are opening wider, time to rise
Fry the bacon, crack the eggshells
Send the paintdrips back to bed
Hell wasn't hot enough for the Reverend Christoff
Front door kicked in, hinges ripped off, believe

[Chorus]
Thi-thi-this ain't a cry for attention
Nu-no this ain't a tear for a hug
Thi-thi-this ain't a plea for affection
I've already received your love, believe
It's time to believe in something
It's time to believe in me
It's time to believe in something...

[D-Sisive]
It's time to believe in something
The blood that I bleed is boiling
Heart pumps fire, heart pumps flames
Every heartbeat scars my veins
Jerry Garcia large heart pumps pain
I started with baby steps
Throwin stones at +Machines+ I would +Rage Against+
They would kneeslap, laugh at my lame attempts
Machine guns aimed at my bayonette
I would train, swallow the pain and sweat
Wax on, wax off, paint the fence
Daniel-san crane with my weight on left
Aim my left foot at your face and neck
Fight 'til my name was a main event
Fight 'til my sane went insane instead
A razor lying on a tongue, waiting for an Adam's
New York nicknamed the press, believe

[Chorus]

[D-Sisive]
It's time to believe in something
I'd rather believe in nothing
than one thing, to dump all my trust in
It's time to believe in something
It's time to believe in me</pre>
