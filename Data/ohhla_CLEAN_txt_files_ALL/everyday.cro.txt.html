[Intro: Crooked I]
How many times I gotta tell you niggaz?
I'm not like you!
{*laughs*} Sup niggaz?!
It's your boy, Crooked I
Yeah, turn this shit up
Turn it up!

[Crooked I]
I ain't never love a cop, they some American devils
Wanna bury me since birth, gave my parents a shovel
Real niggaz don't die, so they scared of the ghetto
What's a puppet compared to Geppetto? Hello
And you Uncle Tom niggaz you nowhere on my level
Rather talk to baby girl over there in the yellow
I'ma tell her get naked but she can wear the stilettos
Got a round jiggly ass but I ain't sharin my jello
It's an alien abduction, put her in my spaceship
Demeanor of a boss, I ain't gotta say shit
I just wanna make hits
Get my new bitch a pair of Sarah Palin fake tits - ya hear me?
I'm a Long Beach nigga, ridin down Crenshaw
Read my bumper sticker, it say "Fuck Rush Limbaugh"
Got hood credit, the streets is my co-signer
I talk shit like Mel Gibson my ghostwriter

[Chorus: Crooked I]
I'm in the streets, tell me where you at?
Put a hundred killers in front of you, I could do that
Me and you ain't the same, but you knew that
If you don't give a fuck throw your middle finger up
Real niggaz fuck with real niggaz - everyday
Live niggaz fuck with live niggaz - everyday
Real bitches fuck with real bitches - everyday
Live bitches fuck with live bitches - everyday

[Crooked I]
It's just me against the world, soldier on the main line
How can I be militant and ignorant at the same time?
I love liquor but I hate swine
Blame it on the complexities of a great mind
I think I'm stuck somewhere in between Malcolm X and Detroit Red
Still chasin after D-boy bread
And I'm hardcore, lay a snitch flatter than that cardboard
sittin underneath the spinnin B-boy's head
I keep a glock, I be tellin degenerates
It'll eat you pussies quick as Ellen DeGeneres
I mix drinks like a hell of a chemis-ist
If you a bitch nigga you forever my nemesis
Killin you is on my itinerary
Shouts out to Bun B and Chamillitary
I'm a Nas "Illmatic" nigga, Jay "Blueprint" nigga
Curtis Jackson with an opinion, +Fifty-two Cent+ nigga

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
I don't live like you, I don't think like you do
Motherfuckers say I'm crazy (crazy)
See I grew up in the hood where the cops try to kill a dude
Ever since I was a baby (baby)
And on top of all that, these gangbang niggaz trippin too
I kept a loaded three-eighty (three-eighty)
They try to brainwash me with the curriculum in high school
I never let them fools play me (play me)

C.O.B., I got a religious career
It's the Van Gogh flow, nigga lend me your ear
Ain't no rally for the feminists, the women are here
Pull your cock out, quit livin in fear
Haha, probably see a nigga chillin with a porn star
Use her like the OnStar, in my foreign car
In other words I only call her when I need help
Give me brains while I buckle up my seatbelt
That's when she told me she was Glenn Beck's daughter
Said she couldn't take her molested incest father
Get it off your chest, bench press harder
I gave her a new name, called her Princess Slaughter
Her dad's a devil, she a hottie still
Made her mandingo like the way the human body feel
Quick question, who embodies skill?
If you don't buy my shit I'll bet the Illuminati will nigga

[Chorus]

[Outro: Crooked I]
Yeah, ha ha
Rebel, music
Blaze one to this shit</pre>
