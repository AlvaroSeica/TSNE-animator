Intro: Young Justice (GZA's Son) and Killah Priest

[Justice] One two, one two
[Killah Priest] No doubt
[Justice] The microphones on...
[Killah Priest] Cross my heart, hope to die
[Justice] I've been waiting along time for this
[Killah Priest] Here we go Killah Priest, '97, '98....

[Killah Priest]
It's the Byzantine king, supreme, all kneel kiss the ring
Into an Elohim, I blow steam from the families of the Maccabeez
Smack emcees watch them scream your majesty, make them suffer
The capacity of tragedy, hold the crowd down like gravity
Back the fuck off, stop grabbing me
Hands off me, niggas start to bore me
I'm getting sleepy, I need some coffee
Me and my Wu-bandits, we bury niggas deep in the canvas
Body bandage, like some mummies
You fucking dummies, you can't take nothing from me
It's the longest waited, the most anticipated, the album hesitated
Scream the name out KILLAH PRIEST, I leave the blood spilling in the street
I'm from the dark hills of Brownsville
The seven shield throwing windmills across the killing fields
Never forget it, tell the rap critics
I speak in arithmetics, so they can never get it
I'm too scientific lyrics explicit
I roll with thirsty niggas, thieves and killers
Tigers, gorillas, faces like Godzilla
We stomp rappers that smile like a cordillera, the God iller
Cross my heart both hope to die
We multiply, by the hundreds, fuck it, by the thousand
See me outside your show browsin, beatin up your soundman
Playa haters and players, we give 'em cold stares
Any last prayersÂ…?

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, yo, concrete techniques, bomb beats and cause casualties
My faculty, hold it down like gravity
Rapidly, threatenin like weapons to adolescents
Ghetto residence quick to past tense your present
State of the slum, kill four play the drums face ones
They cross with smiles, the snake tongue, I'm deep into this
I sometimes gasp for air, deadly warfare
Hot block cops and cold stares
Shots clear like fireworks on July the 4th
Weapons get toss, fugitive slidin off
My force is combined, new world, 2009
Digital, criminals, we make mills in cyber-crime
It's all planned ahead, few times
I see the signs through a great mind
The heaviest chain could not bind

(Chorus, Killah Priest)
We stare you eye to eye
We tell the truth no lie
We cross our heart and hope to die.. hope to die..

[Genius/GZA]
High ranked officials and armed tanks with missile, blood drizzle
Simple fact, you slept on the issue
That before you started jerkin off to joysticks of Sega's
I was rockin' off 100 watt amps in Cerwin-Vega
Truth fine tune it, and ship enough units
Emcees ask, who be those rhyme killers in mask
No doubt, difficult task, the last in the square, beware
Infinite amount of darts is in the air
I'm victorious with no opponents
and blast through components, with microphonics
Watch the whole world live the moment
Anything anti became abortionist
Are incapable of lust, speech, remains motionless

(Chorus 2X)

Hope to die...</pre>
