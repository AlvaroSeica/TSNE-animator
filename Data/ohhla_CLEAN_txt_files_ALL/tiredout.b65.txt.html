[Verse 1]
When I cheated on sarah
I couldnt bring my self to speak
I couldnt sleep
I couldnt conentrate
I was weak
I was strangled by guilt
My heart with glass balls
stone in my throat
I acted like an asshole
Sick to my stomach
knowing I should burn in bed
mad at myself
I took it out on her instead
Pushing it down
beign nice just felt phony
afraid of the phone ringing
Not alone but feeling lonely
Digging a hole
Now that I got a taste
I couldnt get rid of it
what an idiot what a waste
Paranoid and dissapointed
Living a nightmare
my every oppurtunity to wash my hands was right there
When I cheated on Sarah
there wasnt a star  in the sky
It was covered in clouds
and I started to cry
I was cold and I deserved to be
hardened and worthless
Windows painted shut
rebel without a purpose
Clowns smoking ciggarretes
I think I thought I heard her name
killing time with my hands
waiting for the hurricane

[Chorus]
I'm tired out, pave the way, to low on gas to save the day
Slaves and outlaws king and pharoes, no tomorrow slings and arrows I'm tired out
I'm tired out, make the bed, scream loud enough to wake the dead
Light a match, break the bread, all I can do is shake my head I'm tired out

[Verse 2]
When Sarah found out I cheated on her
everything went to peaces
hatches were dug up
my desperate words were meant for jesus
I wanted to die
the future wasnt awfly stable
photographs burned while I stared at the coffee table
The little dog laughed
shaded the cealing fan
words like broken glass this is what I really am
Eye of the storm
we passed damage back and forth
cool of her to be so kind
she said I made a fool of her
I ruled the sand castle
skeleton feeling mourn
people were dying out and babies were beign born
caught in the headlights
the rest of the day coming
I pulled in my sleeve while she begged me to say something

[Chorus]
I'm tired out, pave the way, to low on gas to save the day
Slaves and outlaws king and pharoes, no tomorrow slings and arrows I'm tired out
I'm tired out, make the bed, scream loud enough to wake the dead
Light a match, break the bread, all I can do is shake my head I'm tired out</pre>
