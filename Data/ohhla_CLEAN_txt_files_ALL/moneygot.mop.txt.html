The feature presentation you're now hearin out of your system
is presented in a format for surround sound
Starring them, ultimate thug niggaz from Bucktown
Watch the picture while you listen or GET THE FUCK OUT
This is Marxmen Cinema, motion picture made for the listeners
to vision with the special widescreen edition
Make sho' I hit that liquor when you pass it around
Now kick back, let me tell you how it all went down
It was the money (money) YUP! Money got lost
Nobody seemed to know how the MONEY GOT LOST
So Money switched sides after the MONEY GOT LOST
And they found him at the crossroads cause the money got crossed
He arrived like, Dean Johnson in Bucktown
To the same neighborhood his older brother got gunned down
With a plan to takeover the town and everything in it
The good, the bad, and whatever come with it
See; I know what y'all thinking, but he can't be moved
And he can't be pushed, and he can't be touched
Cause he got goons with necessary firepower
to move in the town and shoot it the FUCK up
But it's another crew of gangsters in the hood
And them niggaz is mad (MAD) sick (SICK) head no good
And them niggaz want parts of the scene, it's a war now
So the town explode like sparks in gasoline
No respect, disrespect, in all aspects
Some niggaz don't know who they fuckin with, they should stop and check
and get a grip 'fore somebody get killed
Now they tossin bullets over Brownsville
It's all over the money (money) YUP! Money got lost
Nobody seemed to know how the MONEY GOT LOST
Money betrayed Money and then MONEY GOT LOST
Money gon' fuck around and get his mommy knocked off
Over this money (the money) YUP! Money got lost
Nobody seemed to know how the MONEY GOT LOST
When Money switched teams that's how MONEY GOT LOST
And they found him at the crossroads cause Money got crossed over this money
