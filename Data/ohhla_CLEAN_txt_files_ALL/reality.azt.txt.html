Song:   Reality Check
Typed by: prince@macmail.com

Would you like a dance to go with my song
Wrong! I got the shotgun barrel that's long
So many shots to your dome
The bullets the roam
So don't stick out your neck
If your home alone
In this life of hell
The holes in your body
They spell,
Relief from despair,
I tell
Truths of evil deeds
Created by the system
I bleeds my people to death
And it feeds on miseries best

[Chorus]

Don't like to think about that rope around your neck-4x
Reality check, Reality check, Reality check
How many ways can you manipulate a gods gift force!!!!!!
Has always been a threat to be reckoned with
Live your life but do you really?
Now let me introduce you to a club named billy
Silly to think that everything is going to be just fine
Give a poor man money and he becomes blind
Freedom to live is freedom revoked
You've been given enough freedom to hang by a rope

[Chorus]

Don't like to think about that rope around your neck-4x
Reality check, Reality check, Reality check
I'm checking your head into hell
Having to be in peace
You rest where your soul dwells</pre>
