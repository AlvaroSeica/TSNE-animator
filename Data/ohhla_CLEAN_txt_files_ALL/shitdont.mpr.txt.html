[Y.N.V.]
You can dance on the water and not get wet, ouhh!

[2Pac]
Shit don't stop
(You can dance on the water and not get wet, ouhh!)
Shit don't stop

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Game rules often slang to them lame fools
Heavy hittin' at this motherfucker's straight spittin'
Diggin' deep into your brain while tryin to explain
why real niggas need to stick to the game
It's the shame got these motherfuckers changin' on me
Jealous-ass player-haters gaming on me
Look out motherfucker, I'm a G
As in gettin' motherfuckers 'fore they come get me
Get mad for the right for the wishes
Fake ass nigga, you're a trick (why?), for fightin' over bitches
You call that a playa hater
Straight-ass sissy
See me at my show nigga miss me
Cause I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit
Got a pistol motherfucker better pull quick
And just cause i'm rappin it don't mean I ain't scrappin
And empty clip when the shit happens, it don't stop

[Chorus: Y.N.V] (2Pac over chorus)
Now my guess is true (Shit don't stop)
Them thug life niggas is a bull (it dont stop)
Everywhere we go (shit dont stop)
The niggas trippin at the door (it dont stop)
I wanna dance with you
You can dance on the water and not get wet

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
All I wanna do is try to Mac the hoes
Spin bank on thangs suddenly I spots my foes
It's like each and every one they got the look of death
I got my 9 nigga
Don't be silly
Watch your step

[Verse 3: Big Syke]
And proceed with caution when my crew is flossin'
Bitches we tossin'
And niggas we crossin'
It's like a murder mind when we hit your hood
It's all good
The punks? I wish you would!

[Verse 4: Mopreme]
Wouldn't it be better to just parlay what we bust
Instead of kickin' dust
Gets a press y'all from nuts
Cause ain't no herbs here
And ain't no morgues
Beware of the water 'cause they full of sharks

[Verse 5: Big Syke]
But in every state
Niggas perpetrate and test
Where I come from fools die for less
And thugs keep thuggin' till their casket drop
It's on 'till I die
And the shit don't stop

[Chorus: Y.N.V] (Mopreme over chorus)
Now my guess is true (Shit don't stop.)
Them thug life niggas is a bull (it dont stop)
Everywhere we go (shit dont stop)
The niggas trippin at the door (it dont stop)
I wanna dance with you (shit dont stop)
You can dance on the water and not get wet

Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
You can dance on the water and not get wet, ouhh!</pre>
