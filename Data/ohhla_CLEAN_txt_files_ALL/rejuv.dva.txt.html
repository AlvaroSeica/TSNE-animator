[Maseo (DV Alias Khrist)]
Whooo!
C'mon, (yea yea)
C'mon, (Brooklyn)
My colleges
I want y'all to do one thing (What's that, what's that?)
You hear it? (What, what?)
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)

{"Move, stomp, move, stomp" - repeat in background of all choruses}

[Chorus - DV Alias]
All my people get up and do your, thing
All my ladies get up and do your, thing
All my fellas get up and do your, thing
Everybody get up and do your, thing

[Verse 1]
Ladies and gentlemen, yeah it's me again
DV slash to K
The master from how to MC-n-sing
But I keep a humble attitude
Far from rude, ex that
I hear the beat and hundreds improve
Get up on the dancefloor
It's been a long time comin like Sam Cook
So what this man cooks has gotta be hot to keep you movin
It's time to blast off
Cuz most cats ain't singin nothin,
and they think that's the formula
Don't quit ya day job fella
Cuz ya dealin with brothers that do this for a livin
Dynasty, Beega Marv, we here to stop all the drillin
For those who like sinnin

[Chorus - DV Alias]
All my people get up and do your, thing (Come on!)
All my ladies get up and do your, thing (Come on!)
All my fellas get up and do your, thing (Come on!)
Everybody get up and do your, thing

[Verse 2]
Aiyyo stop what ya doin cuz DV's about to ruin
The wick-wick wack that your used to
Got thugs, slammin they deuce-deuce
When ya hear this club-banger, produced by Maseo
Brooklyn, yea you know how it go
Got Brownsville up in my veins
So much that a tattoo couldn't even hide my tracks,
but I maintain and stay calm - and drop bombs
Like if my name was, Flex or Saddam
Don't be alarmed huh, cuz this ain't a test
It's DV Alias live in the flesh
When SMG's in the house there's no contest
So I suggest that..

[Chorus - DV Alias]
All my people get up and do your, thing (Come on!)
All my ladies get up and do your, thing (Come on!)
All my fellas get up and do your, thing (Come on!)
Everybody get up and do your, thing (Come on!)

[Verse 3]
Yo, all my people in the place if ya loud
let's turn the threb' up
While the "Ain't No Wait" thump pumps hard in ya chest
Everybody drenched in the sweat from dancin all night
It's a party y'all, so there's no need for the fights
We gets viza-viggity crunk, like the Malerna cats
Where the porevas and the players sip the Henny, Coniyac
Gangsta Boo's in the back yellin "Where the dollas at? "
And the thugs reply "In my pocket, where it's stayin at"
I'm scratchin off, any course placed in my way
Then my plan is, to snatch a couple Grammies off the stage,
and yell "Brooklyn!"
And hold one up for Front Page
You and the little ones see though for my dawgs are out the way
I ain't comin in this game to play
I ain't really with the fame, but I love what I do
And I hope some'll feel the same
But if not, it's all good
I'ma get mines regardless cuz it's all 'bout the goo

[Chorus - DV Alias] 2x
All my people get up and do your, thing (Come on!)
All my ladies get up and do your, thing (Come on!)
All my fellas get up and do your, thing (Come on!)
Everybody get up and do your, thing (Come on!)

[DV Alias]
Yea yea
DV Alias Khrist
'Roll or be rolled over'
That's the slogan
Stop playin
VMR, Dynasty
De La Soul, Native Tongues, takin over
Pop that deck...</pre>
