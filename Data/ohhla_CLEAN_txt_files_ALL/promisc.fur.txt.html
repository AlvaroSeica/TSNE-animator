[Nelly Furtado]
Am I throwin you off? (Nope)
Didn't think so

[beat begins]

[Timbaland]
How you doin' young lady?
That feelin that you givin really drives me crazy
You don't haveta play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

[Nelly Furtado]
Looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light

[Timbaland]
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

[Nelly Furtado]
You expect me to let you just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it

[Timbaland]
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem I don't see no ring on your hand
..I be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent

[Nelly Furtado]
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

[Chorus: Timbaland and Nelly Furtado]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm alllll alone, and it's you that I want

[Nelly Furtardo]
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?

[Timbaland]
Promiscuous GIRRRRL, you're TEASIN' ME
You know what I want, and I GOT what you need

[Nelly Furtado]
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

[Nelly Furtado]
Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute

[Timbaland]
Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?

[Nelly Furtado]
I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?

[Timbaland]
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mine's down

[Nelly (Timbaland)]
I'm a big girl I can handle myself
but if I get lonely I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
(I want you on my team) So does everybody else

[Timbaland (Nelly Furtado)]
SHH! Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
(What kind of girl do you take me for?)

[Chorus]

[Timbaland [while doing that "chicka" noise] (Nelly Furtado)]
Don't be mad, don't get mean
(Don't get mad, don't be mean)
Hey! Don't be mad, don't get mean
(Don't get mad, don't be mean)
Wait...I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on

[Nelly Furtado]
I can see you with nothing on
Feelin on me before you bring that on

[Timbaland (Nelly Furtado)]
Bring that on?! (You know what I mean)
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things

[Nelly Furtado]
I'm only tryin to get inside, your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

[Timbaland]
It's okaaaay, it's alriiiight
I got something that you gon' liiiike

[Nelly Furtado]
Hey, is that the truth or are you talkin trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

[Chorus 2]
[Timbaland]
Promiscuous Girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want

[Nelly]
Promiscuous Boy, I'm calling your name
but you're driving me crazy, the way you're making me wait

[Timbaland]
Promiscuous GIRRRRL, you're TEASIN' ME
You know what I want, and I GOT what you need

[Nelly Furtado]
Promiscuous boyyyy, let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll, you ready?
