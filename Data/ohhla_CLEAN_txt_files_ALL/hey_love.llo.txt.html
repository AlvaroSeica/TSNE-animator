[Hook 2X: Lounge Lo]
Hey love, hey love
Hey love, hey love, hey love

[Lounge Lo]
I'm uptown at the Rucker, white on whites
White tanktop and a belt, to go with my knife
Scream "Beezy", nah, kill', be eas'
Look at shorty right there, man, she off the heez'
Damn, lay in the cut, and I twist it up
And tell shorty in the air, I wanna lift it up
This is me speaking, girl, and what's ya name?
How you feel if we sat down, I quoted my pain
Let me talk to you, let me walk on you
Let me rep, how them Staten New Yorkers do
I'm all in it, plus, baby I'm off on you
And in the mix girl, you know I'll brawl for you
Let's get this cake up, let's get this gravy in
Loan shark, I paid you once, you gotta pay me ten
And is you with me? Yeah, then come together
And when you come baby, let's put our guns together

[Chorus 2X: Lounge Lo]
Hey love (picture me and you together)
Hey love (think of the things we can do together)
Hey love (think of the ways we can do each other)
Hey love, hey love

[Lounge Lo]
That's what's up, I'm kid in this bitch
I can lie in the song, but the hook is my chick
I smack it down, I'm back in town
Are you vexed, cuz I pop decks and clapped the round
Come on girl, now swing with me
I have you all in the bubble bath, sing to me
B.B., B.B., do ya thing, and everytime you hit the cootie, boy, you make it ting
(Hey love) I wanna fuck tonight (Hey love) You make me wanna bust tonight
(Hey love) Of course I want the stuff tonight
Because the kid Lounge Mode do what he likes
Yo, now I'm back in the act
Yo, Banger, let me hit in the back of the Ac'
Fuck it, I hit the store, now I'm back with the ratch'
Push the cream seats back, and now I'm slappin' the laps

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
