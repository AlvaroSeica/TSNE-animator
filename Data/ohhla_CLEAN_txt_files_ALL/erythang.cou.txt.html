It's time to work

[Chorus 2X: Boots Riley]
Everybody throw your lighters up
Tell me y'all fin' to fight or what?
Everybody get your shit started
This is y'all motherfuckin party

[Boots Riley]
Every death is an abrupt one, every cop is a corrupt one
if you ain't got no cash up in the trust fund
Every cat with a gat wanna bust one
Every guest want a +1
Every tenement's a penitent, so every tried man is innocent
Time served should be the sentence spent
Everybody wanna hit a lick
Every one a y'all is gettin pimped
Every time I spit I'm fin' to rip, every cancer is a homicide
Every boss better run and hide
Every human is some kin to black, every Visa got a pin to crack
Every verse is from the cardiac
Every search is involuntary, every inmate want commisary
Every bank note is promissory
Every broke motherfucker fin' to form a gang
And when we come we takin everythang!!!
Everythang! And when we come we takin everythang! {*2X*}

[Chorus]

[Boots Riley]
Every mack want a cadillac, every mark want they scrilla back
Every knock want a hit of crack
in the park or a Pontiac, where every little cent is to the rent
And every roach is a resident
Every truth ain't evident
Every slave story present tense
Every uprise a consequence, every time it be somethin sweet
Every banker is a fuckin thief
Everybody better holla with me
Every fiend need a dollar fifty
Every crime that I did was petty, every criminal is rich already
Every landlord got a complex
Every single is a bomb threat, every sellout mayor hates my verse
Every broke motherfucker fin' to form a gang
And when we come we takin everythang!!!
Everythang! And when we come we takin everythang! {*2X*}
(Right here on the one, go like this)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Everythang! And when we come we takin everythang! {*2X*}</pre>
