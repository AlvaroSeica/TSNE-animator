Song:   I Know What You Want
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want
You want everything, so let's do everything

I'm in a two-door, I'm in a new lane
I gotta know my name, I need a new name
I know what you want

I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want
You want everything, so let's do everything

They moving too slow, we are a new play
So high I lift funny, your love is not safe

I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want
You want everything, so let's do everything

Man down, where you're from, nigga
Fuck who you know, where you're from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay home my nigga
Best rockabye I've grown my nigga</pre>
