[Chorus]
I don't know what the fuck you've been thinkin
But now your sinkin into deep fuckin shit
I don't know what the fuck you've been thinkin
Now get taste of this mothafuckin clip
Ain't nobody bad like this mothafuckin nut
I'm puttin this shit all in your gut
A little puto's gettin cut
I don't give a fuck
Yes you's about to get stuck
In the middle of the night
Boy I'ma turn off your lights

[Knightowl]
I be that dope mothafucka
Comin out that 619, you press rewind
And listen to my lyrics one more time
I'm back like Jesus
So step the fuck back
This ain't no nic nac patty wack bull shit
This is my shit
So sit before I split you fuckin cranium in two
What you wanna do
Mothafucka you ain't shit fool
So fuck you
I'm the dopest of them all
Committing sin to your fuckin skin
The Kngihtowl's got to win
Every fuckin battle that I'm in
You know I'm leavin that ass hopeless
I got the scope and I'm focused
A punk bitch like you can't handle
A real fuckin vandle
Don't step to the lokest
The move you's bout to make is fatal
I'll rob you life like a malester
Does a mothafuckin cradle
You ain't able to kick up dust
Like me when I bust
That mothafucka fool that got the slugs
Like bugs you gotta get sprayed
Then laid like mothafucikn rugs
I'm the baddest and the maddest
You become I'll beat ass like a drum
You can't get none
Cause The Knightowl still number 1
Bitch

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
Dismissin all bitches
I'm puttin fools in ditches
Puttin stiches in a bitch named Shadow
Mothafucka you ready to battle
You said you were the dopest
First learn how to write your own fuckin lyrics
I brings no gimmic
Now don't you try a mimmic
A dope fool like me
Who'll have you runnin beggin for mercy
Or I'ma slice that fuckin throat
That's all shit wrote
Cause you's a mothafuckin bitch fool
Not check the lyrical status
I'm in you can't come in
Go ahead keep knockin
I got you jockin
Know you know The Knightowl
Keeps on stalkin
You used to be down with the cliq
But now it's Lil One them roams the streets with I
There's an old sayin that "bitches never multiply"
So die you weak little fuckin punk
I'd like to throw you inside of my trunk
And stick you in the river
And hope your fuckin ass don't live
You should of known family sticks like glue
Makin money off of you every fuckin day
Bean boy, I heard you're fuckin gay
Actin like you was a fuckin friend
Until the end
I gotta stay true
But you's a little bitch
So fuck you little leva you're through
So watch that ass you fuckin re-fried wet back

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
I'm evil like sin
My foes become holy like a bible
I'm liable to crack the fuckin back of your dome
Like an ass
You know I'm not RUN DMC
So you best not ever COME WALK THIS WAY
I'm puttin my knife in your thoat
And pullin out your fuckin tonsils
Bite your adam's apple
Slice your eye lids with a broken bottle of snapple
Smoke that ass like some fuckin tabacco
Unavoidable my attentions be to
Get rid of all you rap bitches such as you
And all your weak ass punk mothafuckin home boys
Bring the noise you've been thinkin your bad
But when you see me comin
The day that I put this gat in your mouth
MC's like you start runnin
Convicted of many felonies
I was born to be notorious
And still to this fuckin day
The dopest of them all
Is stillin comin out victorious
I'll plan all of my hits
Like the Knight Stalker
And make you a think of the past
Like Hershal Walker
So think about your next move
Or wind up in a dumpster
And never try fuckin
With the real bald headed 619 thugsta
Mothafucka
Pointe trucha tambado

[Chorus]

Shadow watch your back fool
Cause I'ma get you mothafucka
Knightowl comin at em for 98
With my dawg Steve Viscous
Doin that crazy shit mothafuckas
Ain't it just don't stop
(Laughin)
61 mothafuckin 9
(Laughing)
619 fool
61 mothafuckin 9
619 fool</pre>
