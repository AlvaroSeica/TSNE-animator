[Slow Pain]
Ha ha
It's the G-Spot Family
Big time players
Hustler and ballers

[Verse 1: Slow Pain]
Let me hit you in the ear with that saucy love
Player mack in that 'Llac for that man above
Heaven sent to be a player, homey, thought you knew
G-Spot G's, money hustler clique crew
This is for the player in you, the player in me
Slow Pain, Big Daddy Nympho O.G.
Floatin' on the ocean, two million dollar yatch
The moonlight, takin' tequila shots
Money over matter, bases loaded, I'm the data
It really doesn't matter who pocket be fatter
Tell me who gon' pimp, like I pimp
Benihana's, lobster and shrimp
Limousine ridin', cold Dom Perignon
Rollin' with a super freak mob, so it's on
They tell me crossover and I sell a million
But I'm a, platinum player, chillin' like a villain

Chorus: Diane Gordon
This is, for the player in you
It's real, money, dreams, they come true
This is, for the player in you
This game, it's gon' last forever

[Verse 2: Nino Brown]
Now who got the most mack, and who got the most stack
Suckers on the way, hot sex and some six-packs
Who's the papi on these days like a pimp
Got them heinas in the front row, come into my condo
What's your name, how you doin', lookin' nasty (Lookin' nasty)
I'm rappin' to you with my voice that's raspy
Ain't nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind (Bump and grind)
And if you down with it, we gon' do it all night
Worldwide players, I thought you knew, and the
If you ain't down with it, you can skip town with it
Baby, gotta jump on it, I know you want it, though
See, I could tell by the way that you flaunt it, hoe
Fiending for my pesos, the queso
Dame un beso, then let it go
Hell no, G's up
Them other tricks way down
And we clownin' when we mobbin' through your town

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: A.L.T.]
They call me A.L.T. The Saint
Lots of papes but no halo
Pull my own weight, dough, floss, and still stay low
Up in the studio, drinking 40's
With all my shorties, talking 'bout all them crime stories
And we always got a heina or two
She said, "You got a girl," I say, "Yeah, kind of, I do"
I can't be lying to you, because she's finer than you
But you ain't jealous cause I see you got some player in you
Come on, let's get sneaky, you can meet me
On the D.L. we'll takes, even trips to Waikiki
Maybe your homegirl will hook up, or give-e
We're only on the beach, pretendin' to be guilty
Oh well
I just love them females
Sippin' them pina coladas out of the coconut shells
Smokin' a frajo with Don Joe around three
Baby, I got player in me

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 4: ODM]
It's Mister ODM, that brown royal kingpin (Uh)
Ride around Vegas in a rag 'Cedes Benz
Producer, extraordinaire with a tight rap
Somethin' for you players in them Coup Cadillacs
Latino millionaire at the MGM Grand
Big dice, money fiend, with a mic in my hand
We the hit makin' family (Uh hun)
They can't handle me (Uh uh)
Don't get it twisted, baby
It's just the player in me

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Diane Gordon]
This is, for the player in you...</pre>
