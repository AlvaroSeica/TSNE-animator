[Hell Razah]
Renaissance Child!

Living words, Renaissance
Straitjacket Muzik

Black Kings they find 'em and hide 'em in the assylum
In the catacomb of modern day Rome
Daughter of Solomon, son I got 'em
When I turn in this album
They wanna try on my crown
Before they learn to work
They way from the bottom
Its Nat Turner reincarnated
Modern day educated
The insurrection of Son of David
Each verse got my hands flaming
Walk thru hell wit the head of Satan
Tell the Most High we Heaven Razing
Before the bombs get detonated
For the treasures that they kept sacred
Democrats got the same faces
As Republicans who act racist
Fuck a vote, we go revolt
We came on boats, now we sell weed and cook up coke
Sling dope; send a note to the Vatican Pope
And then we toast right hand on your heart
Before the oath, like a s√©ance and call out ghosts of dead folks

(Sample of Joe Henry's "Flesh and blood")
"My flesh and blood
Is no more real to me
Than what it seems"

(Hook) Razah
Black Kings they find 'em and hide 'em in the assylum
Black Kings they find 'em and hide 'em in the assylum

(Sample of Joe Henry's "Flesh and blood")
"Life is for the living
And life comes hard for some"

(Hook) Razah
Black Kings they find 'em and hide 'em in the assylum
Black Kings they find 'em and hide 'em in the assylum

(Sample of Joe Henry's "Flesh and blood")
"The rest of us were flesh and blood
Make it hard all on our own"

(Hook) Razah
Black Kings they find 'em and hide 'em in the assylum
Black Kings they find 'em and hide 'em in the assylum</pre>
