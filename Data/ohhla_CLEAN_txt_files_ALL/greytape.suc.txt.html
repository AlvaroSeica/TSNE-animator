(*talking*)
S.U.C., the motherfucking old S.U.C.
Original Screwed Up Click, squaring off
It's gon' count a lot of niggaz out man
H-A-Dub, Miggity Mike D (what's the deal Ke)
It's the Young Don, (oh yeah)
Hersche' Texas, paper first nigga (oh yeah)
Check it, CMG my click I'ma represent like this here

[Lil' Keke]
I'ma get it while the getting is good, I gotta get it
Hustle stay true, be strong and stick with it
Grind and move O's, travel and do shows
Swang and ride 4's, pimp and mack hoes
Benz is visual, space age and digital
Rims is critical, hater niggaz is pitiful
I roll up, showing off my exhibit
I'm sick with it, said a hundred get a ticket
I rip it get a snippet, then distribute
Chickens and hoes, G's and thugs come get it
With Southside niggaz, that's known to head rush ya
Never been scared, I want attention like Crusher
Hood nigga, with that gangsta talk
But I been a street star, better ask Big H.A.W.K.
So I stand up and man up, cause we can do it
S.U.C. going platinum, and the whole Click knew it

[Mike D]
I swear to God, I'm out here killing myself
Sixty days out the bing now, I'm feeling myself
H.A.W.K. tell them niggaz, I don't need no help
I'm like Roy Jones, aiming for the big boy belt
How many niggaz, y'all know like me
Fade away from the pen, and ball like Kobe
Man Pooh and Den, man y'all best homie
I'ma violate parole, cut both of these hoes
Tripping how a bunch of shit, out here changed
But I'ma sit and watch these boys, crash and burn in the turning lane
Sitting on thangs, blowing on dro
Corle' just lay back, taking this thang slow mo
First, I'ma get the money and the power
Then, find a Rican with the cheapest flower
Yo, leave them bitch niggaz mouth sour
Ha-ha, and that's how Corle' playing them cowards

[Chorus - 2x]
It takes a second to mash a minute to dash, a hour to flash
A gangsta get crash, and try to get his cash mayn
Big Lac sit back, holding on the wood grain
Go hustle get money, try to flip your own thang

[H.A.W.K.]
I got game fame and a name, as big as LeBron James
That bring change and dames, who want my last name
Driving slow in the fast lane, screens falling and bang
And lots of bling bling, on the chain watch and ring
I rap and I sing, plus I'm highly acclaimed
As the coldest artist, up in the rap game
I'm street smart with heart, hotter than a Pop-Tart
I climb the pop charts, with hits like Mozart
I destroy beats, and cling to em like cleats
And I press my pen hard, on tablet sheets
You don't work you don't eat, that's my motto on the street
A hand shake is how I greet, unless your ass weak
Got money like athletes, and my triceps and biceps
Allow me to high step, and get cash like Wyclef
Ideas and concepts, and bad hoes like Hugh Heff
And for Screw I rep, until my last breath

[Big Pokey]
One, this is for my niggaz on the grind
Number two, get money and keep it on your mind
Number three, don't get caught creeping up from behind
We be breaking niggaz down, like a pound of the sticky lime
I'm quick with the iron, sick with the pine
If you riding with your gal, tell that bitch rewind
Jump on 59, pull up at the music shop
Miss em next week, beat a bitch with the trunk popped
I pop vault locks, time on the vault clock
In these streets, trying to go platinum with a soft block
Everytime you see me I'm great, I make they mouth drop
Hoes suck me up, and swallow me like a cough drop
Bitches get tossed out, niggaz get crossed out
You want my shoes, I paid dues to the bald spot
Early bird get the worm, you late so you lost out
S.U.C. till I D-I-E, and it don't stop

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
