Album:  Lost
Song:   The Artist Pays the Price
Typed by: jostmatt at bluewin dot ch

[ CHORUS: Rodney Ellis ]
The artist pays the price
So you don't have to pay
If only we would listen
To what they have to say
We all go through changes
To get to where we're going
We have to learn a life of sacrifice
To keep on growing

[ VERSE 1: Eightball ]
Yeah
Life is for learning, remember this and learn from life
Think about the players in the past who died a sacrifice
Some died in wars for a country that oppressed them
Some died preachin prayin for God to bless them
I am one of the blessed, born to bring the word poetry
Hip-Hop, musically expressin what's inside of me
Some find me entertainin, some find me marketable
A potential black millionaire, so that makes me targetable
Low lives and forked tongues, devils get easy access
Flashin big faces, makin empty promises
Soggy niggas, sign contracts and make deals
Rappin 'bout who they killed, talkin 'bout they keepin it real
Hardcore, homicidal, kingpins of the century
Need to quit rappin and leave this shit to the real MC's
But ain't no chance, opposing forces got the upper hand
Do as they command to keep them from sufferin

[ CHORUS: Rodney Ellis ]

[ VERSE 2: Eightball ]
See
I don't know everything, but my opinion I will voice
As long as I can choose I'll choose the right or the wrong choice
Addicted to hip-hop beats and hoes and can't stay out the streets
Tryina make a dollar without a nigga havin to rob and cheat
Got me hustlin 24/7 365
Coast to coast, mic-checkin, keepin the party alive
Engrave my name in the minds of those who bob to this
Sling and mob to this, jack and rob to this
Herbs and meditation made it pure when I wrote it down
But individual perception will change each phrase around
Different towns, ain't none of this shit like Orange Mound
Players unified, diggin on my mellow sound
Execs get big old fat checks for makin deals
While soldiers like me in the field damn near gettin killed
When this is over, if I could do it again I'd do it twice
Before and after me the artist will always pay the price

[ CHORUS: Rodney Ellis ]

[ VERSE 3: Eightball ]
The industry's full of broke niggas tryina make a comeback
Rappin 'bout that bullshit over them weak-ass tracks
Judgin me when around the globe ain't nothin the same
Think how the world would be if none of this shit had never changed
Ain't like it used to be when hip-hop belonged to you and me
Shit got sugar-coated, modified for TV
Niggas like me don't give a fuck about commercial airtime
Forced underground, ain't nothin commercial about my rhymes
Rather be broke or slingin dope than hold my tongue back
Niggas who put on acts get they ass beat up and jacked
I'm not a killer, just a poet tryina survive, nigga
Given the choice to ride or die, I chose to ride, nigga
I'm payin the price for all the real MC's after me
Be a artist, not a slave for the industry
I'm payin the price for all the real MC's after me
Be a artist, not a slave for the industry
