COME ON!!
Ugh!

[Zach de la Rocha]
Come on..
Although ya try to discredit, ya still never edit
The needle I'll thread it, radically POETIC
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double [Erick Sermon] "I'm Mad", still knee deep in the system's SHIT!
Hoover, he was a BODY REMOVA
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close to the
Rage built up INSIDE OF ME!
Fist in the air in the land of hypocracy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak movements cease when their heads are flown
Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (WHAT?!) the judges (WHAT?!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King, when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots..
And then came the SHOT!!

Yeah!
Yeah, back in this!

With poetry my mind I flex
"Flip" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' dat finesse
Who I got ta, who I got ta do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up
Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then I stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the "Stutter Step" then bomb a left upon the fascists
YEAH! Several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
Ya betta beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots..
And then came the SHOT!!

[gutiar riff]

UGH!
What was the price on his head?
What was the PRICE ON HIS HEEAAAAD?!

I think I heard a shot..
I think I heard a shot..
I think I heard a shot..
I THINK I HEARD A SHOT!
I THINK I HEARD A SHOT!
I think I heard, I think I heard a shot..

[Zack is reading a portion of a COINTELPRO of the Counterintelligence PROgram]

"Black Nationalism... [...]
[He] may be a brave contender for this position
But should he abandon his supposed 'obediance' to the
'White literal doctrine' of non-violence and embrace Black Nationalism..."

"Through Counterintelligence, it should be possible to pinpoint potential
trouble-makers and neutralize them..."

"Through Counterintelligence it should be possible to pinpoint potential
trouble-makers and neutralize them..."

"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."
"And neutralize them..."
