Kick it

Hey yo, this is Bosco Money
And me and Sam Sever don't think y'all know what's up
Rumor has it we some scientific probands
But just cause the name is Downtown Science
Don't mean we can't pull clients
So now that you look at all way
We got a little more to say
But get some shades first
Cause I heard it's so bright
Might wreck your eye sight

[ VERSE 1: Bosco Money ]
Comin live and direct to your stereo
And comin fly, so I guess we're comin aerial
2-1 - made it through the countdown
And now we get like even after sundown
This composition is quick, not to prolong
Lettin the world know what goes on
See, we came to claim a zone in rap
Not on the map, and watch people adapt
To hintin to us and label it our sound
But who will be the one to wear the MC crown
The race is on, it's up for grabs
Civil rights, some will bite, some will kill and take cabs
Take it from me, I used to drive one
Had to quit the night I caught a live one
But now I travel at my own pace
Like to feel the bass up around my waist
Just like a seat belt, kinda keepin me strapped in
Cause when I rhyme I'm the sky captain
So fly - Air Bos with the flair
And me and Sever make a naughty pair

And we're (out there, out there)
(Out there) (but in there) 
(At the same time)

Check it
[ VERSE 2: Bosco Money ]
A pigeon to a statue, a statue to a pigeon
So many rhymes, I need to start a religion
Cause believers just keep poppin up all around
&gt;From what I pull up from the ground
Then blow em away with the science like ?? alliance
And then watch you parachute down and gettin clowned to the firm
The better term, D.S.
Comin from Downtown, y'all know the rest
When proper science is too deep, I drop the skills
Always got somethin for the hills
And you can ponder, think about, see what I mean
And understand why I'm hittin for the Def Jam team
Woops, here goes another one, out the park
You try to front and say that it was too dark
To see the ball, otherwise you woulda caught it
Well, catch this, we want you to support it
Like a ??? cause support can be beautiful
And from the people, any kinda suitable
A pound, a pat on the back, sometime on the air
Or in your walkman - take us everywhere

And we're (out there, out there)
(Out there) (but in there) 
(At the same time)

[ VERSE 3: Bosco Money ]
Hold - and if you think we're not on time
Yo, we're not late, we must be just ahead of our time
How can you clock us when watches are inaccurate
Man-made tools to measure this immaculate
Style, you need to find more than a rule
Bring a king, and we'll open a school
And just reach and teach like it's a day at the beach
I be the sun beatin down with the heat on each
And all, in '91 we're gonna have a ball
Because you shook my tree, and now my apple's gonna fall
To the ground, so polish up the crown
And pass it down to the world renowned
Cause here go we defyin gravity and name it after me
The B-o-s-c-o M-o-n-e-y, gee
And my man Sam Sever, cause both of us together
Form the D-Sci, and we won't separate ever
He's rollin with me, so I roll with him
And we don't judge each other by the color of our skin
It's of no relevance to our intelligence
I rest my case with a fresh taste of elements

And we're (out there, out there)
(Out there) (but in there) 
(At the same time)</pre>
