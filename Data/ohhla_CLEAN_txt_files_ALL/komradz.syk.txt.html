[2Pac]
Eh Storm
Muthafuckaz out here trippin
Yank some of these bitches by they collar baby
Komradz Komradz

[Storm]
For all you muthafuckaz who be tryin to slip and trip
With that subliminal shit, get bombed for you raggedy bitches
So I'm prepared to get so so funktified about some real Outlaw

[Chorus: 2Pac]
You must be
So so crazy
Bitch i'll beat yo' boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my komradz (komradz)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploy's crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my komradz (komradz)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Have you really thought about your part in this participation
My prediction bloody murder similar to ministration
Now in fairness to conversation
Cause it's your fate so take the time to contemplate what you'll be facin'
Talkin' that
Hip-hop shit, don't get shot bitch (booyah)
Cause you can tell
All in your click to eat 'Pac's dick
The clip's in, prepare for the muthafuckin' death blow
Cause every rapper in the industry is history it's Death Row
Not Bad Boy or So So Defffff
I'll make you bow before Tha Row (okay, those other ho's next)
Just like them other hoes
The intricate design of my lethal lines criminal rhymes
From the mind of a thug shakin' state time
Take it to the next phase
You had your time to talk shit
Now bitch'less busta's gettin' checkmated
These days muthafuckas talk shit and turn snitch 
When you see 'em they ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Westside

[Chorus: 2Pac]
They must be
So so crazy
Bitch i'll beat yo' boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my komradz (komradz)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploy's crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my komradz (komradz)

[Verse 2: EDI]
See by now the way this shit is situated
Niggas is gettin' eliminated
Simply for being affiliated
Clearly stated but still I know you hate it
We got a whole list to play with
And y'all niggas is at the top
Now let's make this
Happen
Fuck the rappin'
Let's get to scrappin'
So everbody can see what happens 
When you get caught up in dirty mackin'
Malc can send ya packin
Your boy love action
Sneak up on attack
Sneak up
Let's the slug's snappin'
Yo' chest section
Death has now stepped in
Bitch should have learnt your lesson
While your chance was still present
But now it's past tense
No question askin'
Out West it's called mashin'
Bailin' the corner blastin'

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Must be so so krazy
Bitch i'll beat yo' boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my komradz (komradz)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploy's crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my komradz (komradz)

[Verse 3: Napolean]
(You must be)
I'm in the stash
Pull your niggaz and the ski mask
But we gone rock ass
And hit the glass and tryin do it like the best
Think fast, cuz I'm a blast when your shit get caught
Be in a twisted position thats lined in chalk
I wanna know which one of you niggaz got heart?
For how I can put you in park from the start leave you sleep in the dark
So wrap my dick in your mouth
So I can bring my sisters down south
To blow your bitch ass up

[Verse 4: Kastro]
Must be so so krazy
Bitch you ain't all that Def
Why bother to ride the problem out
You ain't hard so check
Billion dollar verb, throw that dirty calico around your neck
K and so so def bad bust it to death
I got some shit to twist
Niggaz don't mind gettin rid some of these enemy niggaz
Put they ass up as I approach and make a switch over to the fence without gettin lynched
Fuckin with thugs K Kastro about this bitch

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Must be so so krazy
Bitch i'll beat yo' boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my komradz (komradz)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploy's crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my komradz (komradz)

[Verse 5: Big Syke]
Who I'm gonna call when I'm muthafuckin' feelin' sad
My muthafuckin' komradz
Who I'm gonna call when I'm muthafucking doin' bad
My muthafuckin' komradz
And fuck your bitch cause you a trick anyway
Cause my komradz was raised on pistol play
And boss playerism mix with this thugism
So ain't no love in em nothing but the fuck in em

[Verse 6: 2Pac]
Last verse is for them trick people
This is the sequel
I'm a treat you with evil
Livin' forever illegal
Now homicide got me preoccupied
Be a lie if I told you that I never wonder
When will I die
Be assured nigga word born
Cause now it's on you can only survive if you be strong
Until I'm gone
I bust on Bad Boy middle finger to Da Brat
Don't get your young ass smacked
Hehehehehehe

[Chorus: 2Pac](x3)
(You must be)
So so krazy
Bitch i'll beat yo' boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my komradz (komradz)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploy's crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my komradz (komradz)</pre>
