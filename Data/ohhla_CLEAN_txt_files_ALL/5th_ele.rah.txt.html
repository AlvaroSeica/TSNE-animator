Typed by: Quest Rah

I step out from the darkness I'm light for my targets
inscribed on your arches You'll find me at the markets
Read me on your carpets Make you sharp like some carvings
You gotta keep on askin rich or you starvin
here before you born I'm with you when you die
You got an inner storm I'm with you when you cry
ancients wrapped in turbans to modern day suburban
Im the discussion in the circles of the learned men
I come in peace But They take me to war
But I say war  If they kick down ya door
I am the first step Wisdom is the next
Some get vexed when they see me on the set
I was owned by many thru war and thru calm
I was thrown in the river by hulagu khan
I was burned in the library of Alexandria
I was shot it the Autobahn when they gunned down that leader
I am the writing in the torah The writing in the bible
I am the beauty of holy Q'uran recital
Guidance is vital to unlock my title
From Aristotle Im local to hopefuls
I am Ibn Taymiyya
I am Ibn Arabi
I am the middle way like Al-Ghazali
Uh huh ---huh---huh
Some like to bicker wildly
Cos I've been distorted and tampered so highly
Men like to control populations that lack me
wont find me much in newspapers or TV
Catch me in Egypt sprayed on walls like graffiti
your shelf is my home
my dark side was buried under Solomon's throne
precious like the dome
    I came thru the Prophets
    And no one could stop it
    Hijacked by those who wanna fatten up their pockets
    Yeah yeah drop it
    Spit it in a rhyme
the missin 5th element in the hip hop line
    Find me in the mountains
    Where monks meditate
    I strike like lightin
    When you procrastinate
    ----------I'm the solution
    In absence of confusion
    Revered like Shakespeare Tao and Confucius
    Each man gets what each man chooses
    I'm the foundation
    Kinda like a blueprint
    If the lands dry of me then there'll be no movement
    Stop catch the line don't lose
    I'm in every letter of the alphabet you know
    I am in the in the movement of the tai chi flow
    Passed on by ya mother passed on by ya dad
    I was in the old mystic schools of Baghdad
    Bayt al hikma
    Still show my relevance
    I'm translated passed down like inheritance
I am KNOWLEDGE</pre>
