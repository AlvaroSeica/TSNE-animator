[Chorus]
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
Big fat yard with a house on the hill
Old school whip with some big ass rims
I got this here
Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes {*8X*}

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Sometimes you gotta talk to 'em
This ain't even rapping what I'm finna do, let go

Well I suppose niggas gon' hate on me, well that's cool
I got shows, getting money I can barely fold cause that's what I do
And ain't nobody gon' pimp K-R-I-T, yeah that's how I feel
And them diamonds niggas always rhyming bout, it's against my will
And ain't nobody gon' check none of me or mine, in God I trust
If you think I'm out here tricking on these hoes, you got me fucked up
And ain't no playing in the South, turn a bad bitch out when I grab my pipes
Y'all niggas think this shit came oh so easy, it wasn't over night, but

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Now I supposed I'm doing quite alright, ever since I blew
Never worry about me and don't worry about mine player, worry about you
And ain't nobody gon' block my shine today, with the roof gone
I got a top notch bitch, you need something like this, but you gotta get your own
And ain't nobody gon' wreck this hard, when I'm traveling down the boulevard
Now they hollering out, oh my God, cause they never seen rims this large
That's country shit, well that's cool cause I'm country, bitch
I never turn my back, I burn on wax and stack my cash till I'm country rich, cause

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T. - singing]
(I got this here, I got this here)
Chevys on that chrome
Live and in my zone, till a player gone
(I got this here, I got this here)
Doing how I feel
Doors open for hoes, haters in my grill
(I got this here, I got this here)
Diamond in the back
Slamming on these doors, trunk beat till it crack
(I got this here, I got this here)
Get it how I live
Smoking on that good, cracking on my seal

[Chorus]</pre>
