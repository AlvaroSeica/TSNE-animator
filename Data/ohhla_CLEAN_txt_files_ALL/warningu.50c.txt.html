Song:   Warning You (Don't Turn on Me)
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

{*whispered*: "Shhhh, Alex Da Kid is comin"}

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
When they say my time is up, and I am just collecting dust
Don't turrrrrn on me, don't turrrrrn on me
And when they claim that I'm washed up, or when my gums begin to rust
I'm warrrrrning you, don't turrrrrn on me

[50 Cent]
December 9, 9-7, I told Jay I'm gon' blow
Failin's not an option, my son's turnin 1 years old
I wrote a verse about the night I just spent in Central Bookings
Cause my grandpapa coffee pot had cocaine cookin
Fast forward my grind, 9-8, 9-9
More eigths, more O's broken in nickels and dimes
I told niggaz I'd make it, they was doubtin me then
Picture me zonin on the park bench pushin my pen
Who needs enemies? My friends keep shootin my friends
They takin hits now, they'll blow your brains out for a Benz
Call me a dreamer, cause I could see myself on top
Word to Sabrina, I'm gettin my ass off this block

[Chorus]

[50 Cent over Chorus]
Yeah! This is what I am
Forget how many times I'm down
Count how many times I get up, yeah

[Interlude: Skylar Grey] + (50)
Don't turrrrrn on me
(No, no, no, don't, don't, don't)
Don't turrrrrn on me
(No, no, no, don't, don't, don't)
I'm warrrrrning you, don't turrrrrn on me
(No, no, no, don't, don't, don't)

[50 Cent]
Ain't it funny how the niggaz I came up with wasn't bumpin me?
Product of the slum, I guess it's misery loves company
Told 'em I'm a winner, I'd be somethin to believe in
They was more concerned with who was rollin up the weed then
JMJ didn't work, neither did Columbia
Got shot, got dropped, one hell of a summer huh?
One year of recovery, felt like a bag of broken bones
Bill collectors comin 'round, that's when you know you on your own
Strap the vest, cock the chrome, they countin me out, I'ma show 'em
I fought my way out of motherfuckin corners before 'em
Better under pressure, I'm built for it
I been the underdog all my life, I'm still here boy

[Chorus]

[50 Cent over Chorus]
Don't you EVER bet against me
I will NOT, lose
I'm persistent, I'm persistent
I'm sharp, ha ha, yeah

[Interlude]

[50 Cent]
Em and Dre gave me a shot and I ran with it
My homie in the cell sayin "Damn, my man did it"
+Get Rich or Die Tryin'+ made it to the top
I'm fightin off my competition tryin not to drop
It seems like no one seen 'em fuckin with the kid
All they see was me tryna take off they fuckin head
They don't see the slap, all they hear is the shot
Soon as somebody hit, I'm sure they'll run to the cops
How am I the bully of the East if I don't start no beef?
I meet aggression with aggression, I learned that on the streets
I see 'em frontin on they blogs, sayin I'm done
Like I ain't got that flow they know, be number one

[Chorus]
