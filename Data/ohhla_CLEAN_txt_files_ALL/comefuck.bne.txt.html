[Flesh]
Do you really wanna fuck with me?
No, oh, oh, oh, no, nigga, never Flesh
Sooner or later
All of you haters gonna catch vapors
You don't wanna test

You never do know when absolutely nobody
Wanted to fuck with this cat
Then again, you really want a son
and come and get done, easily phat
then wanna put 'em on they back
Clack back mack, everyday focus the beam
straight aim your way
Hittin' and pray
Eliminate playa haters in the ninety eight
And if you hatin' to elevate
the number one thugsta takin' off thousands
And I'm off bounds in here
But he wonder how did I do when I did this
My clique steady housin' fools
Get abused when they run up and lose bad
Look at him singin' the blues, so sad
Never no chance you might have
Had for fuckin' with a man who's mad

Chorus

[Flesh]
Just to know what I'm bustin', some steady buck
and while I keep crushin'
You muthafuckas all ran outta luck
So never me hush up
Some of my boys had to keep me from cussin'
Lustin', pass the bud
Thinking of the bud, never no mercy
First these niggas gotta show a little heat
before we hit 'em where it hurt
Hit 'em up worse with a curse
Gotta put 'em on work daily
Swerve to the curb, hit a herb, hit a nerve
Flagerant all through the Land
I'm the man bump bumpin' in my Suburban
Pump up the volume, and I been through so much shit
You can fit, it got plenty of room
And they assume that they can roll with me
Endin' up laid in they tomb

Chorus

[Flesh]
I gotta handle my business
And I'm in this to win this shhhh...
Never gon' stop til I finish
Any run against me they get diminished
I'm breakin' records in the book of the Guiness
And a nigga really meant this when I said this to you
And the rest of your crew take note
Boast with all of my dogs with a toast
Northcoast niggas, we ain't no joke
Hold, for the most, in a minute, could you?
Oh oh oh no
Then if I'm not you're gonna drop from the bullets I pop
Glock glock shots from my smokin' glock
Stop thinkin' that you can compete with my now
If you was to try then you might die
Should you realize Mo Thug
Millennium ain't to be tried, so why? 

Chorus</pre>
