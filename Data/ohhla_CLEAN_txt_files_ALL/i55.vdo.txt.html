[Chorus]
Let's pull out the 7 50's get the city live
My bitches 20, got em bustin it for 55
But her age say she 55
Plus we outta town I hope these crackers let a slide
Let's pull out the californias, get the corners live
My bitch is 20, got em bustin it for 55
Her id say she 55,
But she got pretty eyes, hope she on a nigga live

You pop shit but never there
Fuck your pelly gear
Hollow tips make your level tear
Like waltz brace don't get twisted
My beretta here
Under my rl sweater, wear with the teddy bear
If it's 9 of us, 9 hammers in
Was torn hailin the rock like cal anderson
Gave her one hit and wonder
So shine anderson
Connect keep hittin my number, I'm not answering
Like hello, they just roll yellow
Ran out of nicks line, told me it's no mellow
He ain't never take out master, gold fellow
Won't settle, I'm killin em dog, all yellow

[Chorus]
Let's pull out the 7 50's get the city live
My bitches 20, got em bustin it for 55
But her age say she 55
Plus we outta town I hope these crackers let a slide
Let's pull out the californias, get the corners live
My bitch is 20, got em bustin it for 55
Her id say she 55,
But she got pretty eyes, hope she on a nigga live

You got beginner shine, richard mille, that's milli times
Gave the bad 3 faces and every bed of mine
Says you fly well I can't see it, a nigga blind
I tell my slum I make em get in line, they get aligned
Jersey mansion, watching scarface like the shit is mine
Versace robe and slippers with 3 bitches high
Need a passport way I'm getting fly
Gy my nigga, don't ask for, but he getting bye
Wanna rock then cop a quarter
On the block, that's not for you
Fill the pot with hot water
I'm focused, word to my God daughter
On a journey to get that, my mellow jersey and nick hat
You fellows urk me with chit chat
Since my mother birth me I've been that

[Chorus]
Let's pull out the 7 50's get the city live
My bitches 20, got em bustin it for 55
But her age say she 55
Plus we outta town I hope these crackers let a slide
Let's pull out the californias, get the corners live
My bitch is 20, got em bustin it for 55
Her id say she 55,
But she got pretty eyes, hope she on a nigga live

I do my thug dizzle, on you cunt pussies
Bitch you know what this is
Straight raw and vicious, see bast and foreign fishes
Gold dreams and hard wishes
Fight like I got 5 fisters
Going through there's more issues
Throwin disses know I'm baggin
Blowin dishes, kitchen like a cook out
Look out, watchin all 4 fences
Benzes and lorenzes till the ex name my existance
My lawyer a beast, I watch him feast on my offences
Me and my comrades bout that vida
Clap, click and quicker than I out that reefer
Hop out that jeefer like what the fuck you lookin at me for
Why? cause I'm lookin like seafor
These niggas be purpin, turn into anton
For the same bitch I put the camera and lamp on
Smokin woods in my camp on
Lookin good, break a yawn and a hand gun

[Chorus]
Let's pull out the 7 50's get the city live
My bitches 20, got em bustin it for 55
But her age say she 55
Plus we outta town I hope these crackers let a slide
Let's pull out the californias, get the corners live
My bitch is 20, got em bustin it for 55
Her id say she 55,
But she got pretty eyes, hope she on a nigga live</pre>
