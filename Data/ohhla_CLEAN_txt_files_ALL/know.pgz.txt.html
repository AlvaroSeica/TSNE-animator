[Intro] (+Big Punisher sample)
(Come one, come all)
Burn City
(Come one, come all)
Ay!
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Plutonic Lab turn the sirens up
Sounds like something from 91
Mighty drums banging like Heidi Klum
Got DJ Bonez on the final cut
No diamond love, no blingy bling
No synthy synth, no singy sing
Just, hip-hop on the gritty tip
Like, kinky bitches with a titty ring
Strictly hardcore, no ifs or buts
No video clips with Linkin Park
No, pop hits in the singles chart
No, club shit, I don't listen to Crunk
New York to London, literally unknown
Victoria's secret, lyrically cut throats
Give you a blood nose with intricate brush strokes
Obese Crew bringing the love home

[Hook] (+Big Punisher sample)
(Come one, come all)
(Toe to toe)
Pound for pound
(Blow for blow)
Round for round
Coast to coast
Town to town
Obese Crew holding it down
(Come one, come all)
(Toe to toe)
(Blow for blow)

[Verse 2]
It ain't over, no paying payola
No playing a game, stay on the same kosher
Make a mistake, lay in the grave soldier
Why burn city blaze like a chain smoker?
No doubt where my sound belongs
No clichÂŽ chants, make the crowd respond
No, forgetting bout the town I'm from
On some rock star shit like Elton John
No Vaseline, no fallacy
No matter what rappers keep telling me
No beef, no greed, no jealousy
No sleep for the people on Melbourne streets
I'm a, happy drunk, back up off me
Trynna say we're not acting properly
Need to look in the mirror like Matt McCaughy
In a Hollywood action comedy</pre>
