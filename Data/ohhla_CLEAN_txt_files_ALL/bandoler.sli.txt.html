Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oh do you want some
Even though you never need it
Do you feel it
But then you want some
Even though you never need it
Do you feel it
Ganja never hurt no one
Lord, you've got to kill off the one youth man
Ganja never hurt no one
Lord, you've got to kill off the one youth man
Well me can't take this pressure for too long
Lord I feel a little lovin' so I know it can't be wrong
And I want 'dem good sinsemilla
Lord, they nev'a 'gon be smokin' like some flame bush ganja
Yeah, me comin' up on the rhythm but we have to say no
But I a man don't spill it pass it
Know jah man
And if ya got a problem
Know we're doin' things slow
Want sinsemilla
But then you want some
Even though you never need it
Do you feel it
But then you want some
Even though you never need it
Do you feel it
Ganja never hurt no one
Lord, you've got to kill off the one youth man
Ganja never hurt no one
Lord, you've got to kill off the one youth man
Run a wicked man say
Lord you've got to kill of the one say
Run a wicked man say
Lord you've got to kill of the one say
Now baby darlin'
Try to understand
That if you're lookin' for lovin'
Right time baby i'm your man
Darlin' try to understand
That everything isn't just my __
Baby it's who i am
But then you want some
Even though you'll never need it
But then you want some
Even though you never need it
