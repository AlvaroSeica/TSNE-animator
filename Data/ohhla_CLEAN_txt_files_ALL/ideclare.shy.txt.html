[Shyheim]
Bring my x-ray visions
See trough you, lace for day
Every bullet counts
And we don't bush straight
I leave you in your ways
Leave your shit, spittin'
Hollow heads in your head
Hollow head collision
I'm bad news,
extra, extra, read about me
Blowin', stolen,
Cops glockin' 197 lobby
My philosophy making niggas think they rockin' me
They can't possible!
I'm not a suspect, i'm far from that
And that uncontrolled substance
Like crack, cocaine
And Inspectah Deck
I don't know how you see it
But it clean ya specks
I'm too complex, what you say complex?
I leaved you stressed with a complex
You better stop playin' games
That's the advice I suggest

Chorus 2X:
I walk like I'm at war
Talk like I'm at war
Don't sleep like it ain't war
You speek like it ain't war
Better read the "Art Of War"
Before crossing my lines
You better read the "Art Of War"
Before crossing my lines

[Shyheim]
It ain't over till we even,
I even got the life support
Machines shook to keep you breavin
I'm beef increasing, bees season
You can peep my 8 by 10 photos
In the 1-20 prison
I'm runnin to your vision, squeezin
For no reason, make it so hot
Hot summer, Shyheim should be a season
Be the greatest like Ali Muhamed
We get a million youths to march
Trough New York like I live Muhamed
Predicted platinum, ya know should dimers
27 can glamerish, we communists
And ghetto richs to the extreme
Devine put the money behind the dreams
Of the microphone vein
Now rushin trough your screams...

Chorus 2X

Outro:
Bottom lines...
