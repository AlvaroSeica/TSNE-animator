[Intro]
L.A., L.A. that's where I stay. And I ride of them thangs like everyday. 
Totally awesome okay? And if you don't believe me come around my way.

"Standing on this mountain, lookin' over L.A., at the break of day"

"Out of Cali with a bang bitch, fuckin' insane bitch
The man's savin' L.A." - Ryu on 'Can't Leave Rap Alone'
"L.A."
"Savin' L.A."
"Out of Cali with a bang bitch, fuckin' insane bitch" 

[Verse One] [Ryu]
Yo, the man's savin' L.A.
I rock the California State flag over my face
Aye, and when they takin' over, gotta notice the flow brah
I caught a little break with Shinoda and Hova
Without the mixtape
Green Lantern with smash hits
The song I did with Juelz Santa was bat shit
Fact is, I'm nasty
In need of a sponge bath
I make you make a face like you sniffin' a skunk's ass
Mash out
Motherfuckers better know the program pronto
I'll kill your boss soft, make your capo, compost
Dudes, wanna fuck around?
Fine, I'm chillin'
You may have a couple nines, but I got a few kagillion
It's sad lavish
After mathematics 
Uh
In the home of fine wine and cash addicts
You want static, you can handle it simple
A couple batteries and jumper cables hooked to your nipples
I'm from

[Chorus]
L.A., L.A., that's where I stay
And we ride of them things like everyday
"L.A."
Totally awesome okay
So if you don't believe me come around my way
Around my way
"Out of Cali with a bang bitch, fuckin' insane bitch
The man's savin' L.A." - Ryu on 'Can't Leave Rap Alone'
So watch what you say
"Savin' L.A."
I'm here to say the day
"Out of Cali with a bang bitch, fuckin' insane bitch"
"I get it baby" - Masta Ace - 'Born To Roll'

[Verse Two] [Bishop Lamont]
Is it...L.A. or is it Entourage?
Actors actin' like gangstas, rappers wrapped up in facades
Stuck up models and broads, stuck on Hollywood's mirage
Stickin' fingers down they throats tryin' to keep a model's size
Sunshine
This is where the ballers live
But hit my side of town, this is where they'll rob you quick
Carson, Cali
You can take the 1-10 to the 91 East and hop off on Wilmington
Compton's next door
Long Beach on the other side
Harbor City ? 
Extra five minute ride
Peace to my Mexicans, Samoans, Cambodians, Asians
Even a few white boys in the hood hayin'
Blowin' kush, ridin' Chargers and Harleys
Do we got love for the police?
Naw, not hardly
This the west coast, more than low-lows and gang bangin'
My city got the whole world imitatin'

[Chorus]
L.A., L.A., that's where I stay
And we ride of them things like everyday
"L.A."
Totally awesome okay
So if you don't believe me come around my way
Around my way

[Verse Three] [Tak]
Rollin' through Laurel Canyon and my home in Los Angeles
Listenin' to this song I did before I was on the cannibis 
Make a right off of Cressant Heights and blockin' up my speed
Cause Cheapshot's spinnin' right on top of the Roxy
Yep yep phenomenal
Tak done got a street buzz
Shots in the abdominal, rendez-vous at The Key Club
Once I get a cutie I would like to spoon
I move her right across the street into The Viper Room
Sheeeit
They know my face in over half of the globe
That's why I'm still up in the place drinkin' after they close
Once I got a little itch for some bucks to spend
I take a trip to Las Vegas, hit The Rustic Inn
Yeah and I ain't quittin', I'm sippin' on hell's fire
Once the mission is finished we dippin' to Mel's Diner
Check my wristwatch it's a quarter to five
And hit the last pit stop baby right off of Highland
In...

[Chorus]
L.A., L.A., that's where I stay
And we ride of them things like everyday
"L.A."
Totally awesome okay
So if you don't believe me come around my way
Around my way
"Out of Cali with a bang bitch, fuckin' insane bitch
The man's savin' L.A." - Ryu on 'Can't Leave Rap Alone'
So watch what you say
"Savin' L.A."
I'm here to say the day
"Out of Cali with a bang bitch, fuckin' insane bitch"
Come around my way

"L.A."</pre>
