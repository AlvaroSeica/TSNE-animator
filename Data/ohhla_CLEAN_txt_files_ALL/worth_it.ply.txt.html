[Intro]
Oh this is so real right here man. Play-N-Skillz I'm in the booth I'm
rapping Skillz is rapping ha ha ha it was worth it man for real. The Process

[Chorus]
Just because the pen won't show
It doesn't mean that you're alone
Cause I've been through a lot that I don't know
That is even worth It
And if I make it you should know
That I made it on my over own
Now I'm on the radio
I guess this music's worth it
I can see that you wish you could be me
I can see that you wish you could be me

[Play's Verse]
The year's 1998
Me and my brother a couple of crates
Two latinos Two brothers from that lone star state
I got the music with a dream

For the cream got to go and get it
I'm in the game there's ain't no way I'm going to forfeit
I reminisce passing flyers I had to pay my dues
And now I'm on the same flyers cause I paid my dues
It's 2001 when I start to make my run
I got the music know it's hot, but I'm lacking funds
I need a hand maybe 2 give me the whole body
And who believe very few if anybody
My momma and pops broke, my girl got into my own body
But now the stuck with a nobody

[Chorus]

[Skillz's Verse]
Everytime I wake up
I'm thanking god I'm caked up
Ya'll never had no faith in us
5 stations playing us
Same City ain't that pretty
Wasn't Easy never greedy
All about the bucks and now y'all goin' see me
Don't give a fuck if ya'll believe me
I was behind the scenes
But now it's more creme
It wasn't plan to be
But now we plan to be
The next producing duo
Just like a game of uno
We the last ones left
You better catch your breath huu... (deep inhale)
At times I wanted to quit
But Play would give me shit
He said I had a gift
And now it makes sense
I kept my sleep in brain
I really did complain
Even though I'm getting fame
Ya'll know I won't change

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah Play-N-Skillz this is The Process baby
Yeah Dallas, Texas 2-1-4
You know I go to shout out and thank everybody
who helped Play-N-Skillz believed in them
The G4 Family what up boss, all our fans

rest in peace Mike D and all the fans

[Chorus]</pre>
