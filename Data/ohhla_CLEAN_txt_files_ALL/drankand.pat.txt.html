Typed by: r0llinlacs@yahoo.com

(Verse 1)
Smokin blunts back to back, 350 for a sack
Cup full of purple jolly ranchers, a whole pack
Yellow 'tuss got me slow, and this molly got her loose
Lookin like a forest fire, blowin pounds of that koosh
Lungs full of good weed, gettin money out the mud
Cali love, Cali bud, fell in love with the plug
I got throwed off the drank, doze off about a hour
I'm smokin ass trippy nigga, to the ninth power
Blowin strong and that loud at the same damn time
Drankin 'tuss and that activust, trippy out my mind
Say I need to slow down, bitch ya need to mind ya business
Rollin Swishers back to back, sippin drank, handling business
Feelin like I'm lost in space, left my mind on the moon
Half a zip ain't enough, I need a whole damn zoom
Man I'm faded to the max, fell asleep on the phone
Got my swishers and my cup, bad bitch, I'm headed home

(Chorus)
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong

(Verse 2)
Cheech and Chong on the phone keep a playa in that zone
Sucka free, spend a g, but that's all just for me
Blowin bands and strands of that good cali reefer
Passin blunts with Wiz Khalifa, got that Pimp C in my cup
Yeah that Texas-T, Bun B
What I'm smokin? O-G
Chinky-eyed China man when they come and find me
Always keep a liter, put that lean on some ice
This a first class ticket, bout to take a trippy flight
Short days, long nights; Got a pimp feelin right
She said "What's that in your cup, you sippin surp?", Damn right
Got a quarter pound of strong, blow it all in one night
Get'cha papers and ya blunts, bong smokers or a pipe
Blue dream got me floatin, cup full of dirty Sprite
Livin a rockstar life, don't remember last night
Certified trippy niggas doin this er'night
If I wasn't gettin money, niggas'd swear I was alright

(Chorus)
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong</pre>
