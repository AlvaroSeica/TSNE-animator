[Intro: Wale]
Don't mind me baby, heh (bounce, bounce)
We takin over summer (bounce, bounce, bounce fool)
Young gettin it, haha (bounce)
Let's take it home, champ (WHOOOOOOO~! Ay, ay, look)

[Chorus: Wale]
Shawty got a big ol' butt - oh yeeeeeeah~! (Bounce, bounce, bounce bounce bounce)
Shawty got a big ol' butt - oh yeeeeeeah~! (Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce)
Clappers to the front, front, front, front (okay, okay)
Clappers to the front, front, front, front (okay)
Shawty got a big ol' butt - oh yeeeeeeah~!

[Wale]
(WHOOOOOOO~!) Ay Wale!
Bounce, bounce, bounce, fool - I put the city on
Bounce, bounce, bounce, fool - then I put my niggas on
Bounce, bounce, bounce, fool - I ain't gotta say too much
It's rap anticipation keepin' radiant stadium
Ooooh, rap fool, see that from a block away
I ain't pessimistic but I dropped a couple not today
OOOOH - Bet she call you not today
I told 'em all my lot is out, I know the dame like Skylar team
Ooooh - I wonder if she shot up
I just know her favorite song is "Started from the Bottom" (haha, work)
And I ain't hatin' mama, fact I wanna take your number
Said you save yo bread from Magic something happened then went viola, now

[Chorus]

[Juicy J]
Yessir...
Shawty come shake that ass for me, let a trippy nigga see what you working with
Can you clap that ass? Do a handstand, girl, make your booty wiggle, do a perfect split
She got the fattest ass, she got the perfect tits, I wanna get some head, come on work your lips
I'm high in the clouds, I'm not coming down, I'm so turned up I can't find the ground (sippy)
Sippin' syrup by the gallon, smokin' kush by the pound, make it flood with the ones, broke bitch might drown
Juicy got chips like Frito-Lay and I'm fuckin' these chicks out of D.O.A
I'm so dope boy fresh that you think that I'm sellin' blow
Take your chick to VIP and get her pregnant in her throat (damn)
Shawty bust it open for me, I might throw this cash (let's go)
Shawty throw that ass like a hail mary pass (hm-mm)
I'm fuckin' me a new chick every night
Make that ass clap, I don't care about that cellulite

[Chorus]

[Wale]
Clappers to the front, got a backwood full of skunk
Got a white boy with the funnel gentrifying, that's whats up
Look, clappers to the front, all you niggas got is full of scum
Now she finna bust it loose, screaming rest in peace to Chuck
It's that DMV, we up at KOD
And I can CC you these CC's but don't be OC

[Nicki Minaj]
Uhh, shout out to that cellulite, got a real bad bitch that will sell you white
Got another bad bitch that will sex you right, got a couple hoodrats on Section 8
Make a nigga cum, dont procrastinate, ass on 5-0 come crack the case
Got ass for days, come activate; this ass on fire -- evacuate
Throw that ass in the air, evaporate; where your money? Let a bitch evaluate
If you 'bout big money, elaborate, I'mma shake this ass till I graduate, nigga

[Chorus]

[Outro: Wale] + (unknown male)
Uh, bounce, bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
Yeah, yeah, uh, bounce bounce, look, look
Sayin rest in peace to Chuck, uh, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Sayin rest in peace to Chuck, yeah, uh-huh (yeah, yeah)
Sayin rest in peace to Chuck, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
And in that city I'm the one, let's go (Scotty)
