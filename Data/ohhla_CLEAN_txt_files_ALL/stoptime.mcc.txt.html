[mc chris]
Please allow me to reintroduce myself
My name is Chris, and I do not exist
It's just some shit that a kid did just for kicks
An effort of a last ditch to stop the steel, from slittin the wrists
Thick in the midst of life bein a bitch, or just bein Chris
That's when the little fucker just started flippin the script
Cleanin his kicks, clearin his throat, bettin the chips
that there's a bunch of kids like him with no rims
No checks, no chicks, no switches to flip
Like Edward Scissorhands with, mad salivia glands
mc chris spits like a kid, when he is really is a man
And he really is a fan of the Skywalker clan
And any other band claimin that they're weaker than
Started out a solo mission, quickly became round up
Of any underdog, any unloveable pound pup
Any motherfuck who's a thug, thanks to bad luck
Any punk that's drunk cause he ain't found love

[Chorus 2X: mc chris]
Oh I... drop rhymes...
Cop kind... stop time

[mc chris]
By verse two I wasn't even on the map
'Til all that jazz let all the cats see where I was at
They downloaded all my raps, saw the shit was fat
Like Fat Albert on the can after eatin fifty hams
Mad kids were clappin hands with their windows down
Fuckin up the town with the MC sound
Consider this MC effortless, never felt profound
Now it's, fuck a pronoun, third person from here on out
That's what people do with clout, when they wanna get their pimp on
They show up uninvited and they double dip their chip on
I'll instill a little pride in the shy guy with the clip on
Back by the punch bowl and the bumpin sound.. system
He's dancin all by himself
He wants to dance with someone else
Ah yes it helps if you speak a little elf
Chant the tiniest Hermione spell, it'll make the mightiest melt
Watch him crumble into puddles cause he's just a geek
You supply the l33t speak, we'll supply the beat
It's a brand new dating service to an the endless sea of nerdage
Check the verbage then please look beneath the surface, c'mon

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
My voice is just like me, really fuckin high
It's sad you wanna battle, hope you just upchuck and die
I'm not here to look fly, by dissin on some guy
I'm here to hit on ladies with my motherfuckin rhymes
These are troubled times and we all need to squash the hate
Just like David Silver 'fore this next commercial break
So before you log on just to motherfuckin flame
You have to understand you missed the point and you are lame
You think this is a game?  This ain't no RPG
mc chris is just a brand homes, that shit is hardly me
Tryin to hustle for the dollar, and get somethin to eat
Pay my bills, buy some games, and perhaps a little weed
Is that too much to ask?  Do I seem too defensive?
Pensive over lessons that some fans are double guessin?
You guessed it; and how does an MC stay impressive
to all the naysayers, knuckleheads, and rubberneckers?
By mic checkin I reckon, reflect a moment or second
On the most bad-ass tag team you seen since Tekken
Representin like I'm Fenton, all ass I kick
mc chris will let you in if you don't start no shit, c'mon!

[Chorus]
