[Abilities] 
To everyone out there... 

[Eyedea] 
Speaking of out there 
SPEAKING of out there 
Where's he from? 
He's from some other planet, I heard 
He traveled... 

[Abilities] 
I think that's a myth 
I heard about that kid 
That one from St. Paul 

[Eyedea] 
No... heh... no 
He ain't from St. Paul 

[Abilities] 
Well, he says he's from St. Paul 
But no, I think you're right 

[Eyedea] 
Yeah, he says he's from St. Paul 
Cause it's, it's more marketable when you talk about you're from Earth 
But check it out 
It goes a little something like this... 

He dug deep in his system to find nutrition for others 
Lost sleep, tossed and turned, only to learn love is expensive 
Talk was cheap, till my thoughts grew feet 
Now I take them on walks with me 
But don't let them off the leash 
Cause they might cross the street and get hit 
Listen a second, I pretended to need a friendship 
With many forms of energy till everyone repented 
Now I'm end this with a sentence(?) and a sentence become a way of life 
To stay the night with my notebook, then wake up the next day to write 
Again, and again, and again and again and again and again 
Until my pen is inevitably inseparable from my finger skin 
Lingering in the depths of this pool of resendential 
Fighting a million and ten inner battles that'll sprain my neck into dudes(?) 
Bobbing my head to keep cool, true, stays on the down low 
Meaning proof for the bleeding, is it useful in the council 
Meaning it cheaper what you believe to be the dopest at the moment 
Yeah, he's exceeding the quotient and feeding me tokens 
But the machine must be broken 

[Chorus] 
Cause he'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook 
So he steady throwin jabs just to get him to look 
Man, every thought he ever had quietly sits in his book 
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push 
Rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook 
So I'm steady throwin jabs just to get him to look 
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book 
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push 

[Eyedea] 
From the north side to the southside, to the wild side to the pesticide 
To the genocide to the homicide, you decide to set aside 
Well, pick a side, any side, are you along just for the ride? 
Oh me oh me oh my, I wish you would just die 
Cause kid, you're the reason for my sore throat 
Petty more dope(?), the war won't stop till you hop in a porthole 
And sort those problems out, child, it ain't all about your style 
Cause you could break your back to state the facts and make them smile 
While the pain in my religion, paintin by the pigeons 
Strainin while you're listenin to this brain on tire ribbons 
Givin a splittin headache with energetic delivery 
Livin as a poetic shredded by the edge of misery 
Vividly describin the pain inside of this entity 
Physically and mentally, we all pretend to need sympathy 
Interesting enough, you say you don't give a [fuck] 
But there's much I grew to like through this mic that I clutch 
So keep your hands down, and put your attention span up 
Understand now, man, sound is a dimension you can't touch 
Plants crush, when the vocals of that local named Eyedea hit your ear 
So c'mon, get your chair and stand up 

[Chorus] 
Because I'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook 
So I'm steady throwin jabs just to get him to look 
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book 
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push 
Rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook 
So I'm steady throwin jabs just to get him to look 
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book 
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give you a push 

[Eyedea] 
Every mama I am(?) with a friendship bracelet and a tin can 
Get your business down and dig me up outta the ground when you get rich, man 
I'll take a round of applause, but won't take no kids hand 
Cause the challenge tonight is to balance my bike without a kickstand 
Now a spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down 
In a room full of [hookers], well my head isn't in town 
I consume what you, shoulda, and assume that the lookers 
See the moon and the fact they pushing you to do more than push a broom to 
cushion 
Tune rolls to your head, and enables you to see 
There really is more to life than bustin [guns] and smokin [weed] 
But we proceed to say it ain't fair until we got gray hair 
But next time I ask you to think, please don't give me a blank stare 

[Chorus] 
Yo, cause I'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook 
So I'm steady throwin jabs just to get him to look 
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book 
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give you a... 

[Eyedea] 
Give you a, push it up now, push it up 
Push it up now!  Push it up 
Lemme see them hands, people (Push em up now!) 

[Abilities] (overlapping Eyedea) 
Push it up now! 
Push it up now! 
Push it up, push it up now! 

[Eyedea] 
What planet is he from? 
What planet is he from? 
He goes, he goes, one, two 
Up in silicone and ice cream maintain glish mill (?!) 
(some jibberish) ...better play with my wood, E-Y-E 
D-E-A, bombard bitchy wits of par-tea bags, diplomatic to the hip 
Hop around, hip hop around, said hip hop around now, now, now 
Just grab your partnee and dozie-dough 
And just listen to the RC kids can flow, whoa, whoa, whoa 
*laughs and catches breath* </pre>
