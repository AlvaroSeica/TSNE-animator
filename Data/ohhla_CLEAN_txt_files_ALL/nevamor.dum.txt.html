[Dungeon Masta]
Never seems to be no, peace in these parts, streets is an ark
Gettin' vexed, putting, heat in your heart
Tried to creep, peeps getting smart
Walk around, talking shit, teeth grit, beef is an art
I got a craving for killings, like dentists put in fillings
Right now I'm feeling evil, mercy to those who tempt me
My attitude's the same, this ain't no game, don't make me laugh
The only thing I see funny is creating blood baths
Cuz when I make you fall down, you won't get back up, I'm telling you
Body outlined in chalk, front page article
I'm not warning you, I'm telling you, that's how it is
I'm not the nigga to be fucking with, that's what it is

[Chorus: Dungeon Masta]
(Nevamor) I heard ya'll niggas talking, when I was out there smoking
Fucking with me (do you think my life's a joke, nigga?)
(Nevamor) I see you parasites, can't stand you parasites
Fuck with me tonight (do you wanna take a flight, nigga?)
(Nevamor) ya'll not a friend of me, ya'll niggas enemies
Playing with my sanity (who's the next to die, nigga?)
(Nevamor)

[Dungeon Masta]
Confuse the next and mad at this, no comparisons to the
Trials and tribulations of patterns that seems to arrive
I cannot wait, I got a blow, so stop judging me
Ya'll not budging me, ya'll niggas ain't, bug like me
Let it go, so if I owe you, bet ya ass won't get it
Shouldn't have gave you (you a threat now, I got to stay to that shit)
What's up now, so when I see you, better pray to God that I won't eat fool
Because I got a taste for blood, for that, I'm in the mood (Nevamor)

[Hook: Dungeon Masta]
Where will we go (to the top, baby)
What will we do (get money, gettin' money)
When we will stop (never weary, never weary)
It's not up to you

[Chorus]

[Dungeon Masta]
I'm amongst the grimiest shady, once twice, three eighties
Make me want to go make noise, who shot my boy
I don't know, somebody's gotta pay, ya'll faggots gotta pay
Cuz when we retaliate, you won't make it through the day
The only thing that flow through my blood is vengeance
(Yo, son, word is bond, grimey yo, yo...)
I done bust off a lot of gats, I did a lot of dirt
A lotta cats got hurt, dogs bark but can't bite, what's wrong?
Scared to put in work, a lotta bitches flirt
With the upper gut, and stretchmarks, rocking mini-skirts
I stay medicated, cuz I feel a lot of pain
I got a lot on my plate, a lot more on my brain
There was a time in my life, when I smoked a lotta crack
Messed with dust and broccoli spears, no longer am I doing that
I did a lotta this, and I did alotta that
I apply alotta pressure, when I see alotta rats
I been around this block alotta times, copped alotta dimes
Even grind alot to make the cash, to gain alotta shine

[Chorus 2X]
