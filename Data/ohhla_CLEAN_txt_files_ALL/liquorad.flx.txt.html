[Intro: Ace Hood] (DJ Khaled)
Ace Hood!!!! We The Best son! (FUNK FLEX!!!)

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
Bring the liquor and the drugs nigga, tell money I'm in love wit' 'em
Tryin to get it like twelve ways, gotta get this money e'ryday
For my mama and my brother them, for my niggas know I got them
We in the buildin nigga know it's goin down! (Down!) down! (Down!) down! Down!) down yeah!

[Verse One: Ace Hood] 
I say now god damn homey I am at it again
Paranoid all this money keep up thick in the biz
Livin room got us hopin Lord washin my sins
From the city where them niggas die in front of their kids
Cut throat, and the murder murder all that they know
Got some homies doin time ten and most for the coke
Got no love for the dough, infactuated with dough
And money comin too fast that's when they hate you the most
We pretty bitches then lord, so they fuckin me good
Crib 1.2, I made it out of the hood
I got my wrist on chill, talkin negative five
Never war with a snitch you got correctional ties it's real!

[Chorus: Ace Hood] (*DJ Khaled)
(*FUNK FLEX!!!) Bring the liquor and the drugs nigga, tell money I'm in love wit' 'em
Tryin to get it like twelve ways, gotta get this money e'ryday
For my mama and my brother them, for my niggas know I got them
We in the buildin nigga know it's goin down! (Down!) down! (Down!) down! Down!) down yeah!

[Verse Two: Ace Hood]
I say now money and power, gotta field to the cowards
Gettin head in the rose, ain't speakin of flowers
Bitch I stunt for a livin, talkin Travis Pastrada
Got a white panamera, probably name it Madonna
Neck covered in gold, check full of them o's
Clique full of them Zoes don't want no problem oh no
One up in N.Y.C. home of B.I.G.
I done passed through the club don't need to see I.D.
Hey I'm that boy from the bottom, gotta house 'round my collar
Had the taste of the money I want the whole enchalada
Come and fuck with the real, e'ry ball on the pill
Every whip is a foreign, european it's sealed
HUH!!!!

[Chorus: Ace Hood] (*DJ Khaled)
(*FUNK FLEX!!!) Bring the liquor and the drugs nigga, tell money I'm in love wit' 'em
Tryin to get it like twelve ways, gotta get this money e'ryday
For my mama and my brother them, for my niggas know I got them
We in the buildin nigga know it's goin down! (Down!) down! (Down!) down! Down!) down yeah!
