Pay you back, pay you back, pay you back
Pay you back, pay you back, pay you back
(C'mon. Uh, uh, uh. D-Tension y'all. Time for the essence)
Pay you back, pay you back, pay you back
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back (One two)
And now, I'm gonna even the score
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back

[Verse One] [Encore]
I relinquish correspondence with the world for a minute
On a mission for dolo, exposin' myself then my soul to see what's in it
Huh, stayin' relentless with it, makin' e'rything that I'm spittin'
Passin' any litmus test with gritty finesse
See it's the essence 
I hit you with that big city presence
Lessons
Touch your soul like a small town reverend
It's a all lounge session
We paid dues to make pension
Y'all ready to roll baby, check your suspension
Get on your good foot
Get it in gear
Crew up in here
Holdin' down half a hemisphere, rap racketeer 
Packin' black battle gear
Smack dab in the middle of some Kibble N' Bit music, y'all fool wit
See my style's sweet, like, "Allow me"
But when I say I speak for the meek
It ain't about me, it's about we
Like when we gonna unite?
And when we gonna rise?
When my people gon' get the hunger look back in their eyes?
It's time

[Chorus]
And now
I'm gonna even the score
(We're hear to even the score y'all)
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back (yeah)
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back
And now
I'm gonna even the score
(I came to even the score, yeah)
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back 
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back (tell 'em)

[Verse Two] [Encore]
Descendant of Kane
A +Smooth Operator+ choppin' up game
Let your brain cooperate with my slang
I talk with a twang
Encore, yeah, that's the operative name
Sha-Ya when I'm talkin' to dames
Yeah yeah
You want no part of this
Cold hearted as Spartacus
Greco-Roman showman 
Slide a house mouth piece, spit to The Architech 
If you lookin' for that shit this is the heart of it
Huh, y'all know the essence formally known as the artist
With that backpack appeal 
I still bust and spit them gems
But now it's just with different facets reveal
I take it back to 'em 
But used to max-a-mil up on the hill
That's where me and Gram flipped facts and polished steel
Yo
I'm talkin circa '92
Word to God
He hooked the beat I worked a rhyme through
Like a massage
Got all the kinks out
Now we flawless
Awe yes
Bystanders try to find my grammar like the Loch Ness
I got this rap shit locked in as if it was claustrophobic
Notice me holdin' mics like a hostage
My words move at the speed of gossip
MC's proceed to breed that garbage, but I got a conscious
I move hip hop like it's an offense
Poppin' hot ones from shotguns 
So y'all can go ahead and try to change the plays and scrimmage
This shit here
It came from Kemit
And ain't no way in hell y'all finna change me image
It's time

[Chorus]
And now
I'm gonna even the score
(I'm hear to even the score y'all)
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back 
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back
And now (yeah)
I'm gonna even the score
(Even the score, check it)
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back 
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back (tell 'em)
And now 
I'm gonna even the score
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back 
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back 
And now 
I'm gonna even the score
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back 
I wanna pay you back, pay you back, pay you back</pre>
