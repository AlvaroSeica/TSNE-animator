[Pharrell]
Aiyyo, all they wanna do is dance
That's all they wanna do

[Common]
Uh, uh
Get-get-get it
Get-get it (what?)
Get-get it (what?)

This, is, that automatic
I stay fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
P goes spastic, C galactic
Southside boy, we Cadillac it
Charismatic, Asiatic
I hustle for mathematics
Cameras, action, changed the status
Actor tappin yo' favorite actress
Gucci, rockin, coochies, poppin
Movie, watchin, booties, droppin
Body, movin, showin, provin
Stylin, and bein fly (c'mon)
I touch the masses like a Catholic
Expensive rap shit, my future's backlit
Interact with the cat who macks and stacks
My vernac' attracts y'all react; so let's go uhh

[Chorus: Pharrell]
This is that new shit, keep 'em standing in line
That universal, mind control now move yo' behind
Uh, you know you like it; it's calling yo' name
Nigga, this is that new shit, and it don't feel the same
It's got that dang da-da-dang d-dang-a-dang dang
Dang diggy dang d-dang-a-dang dang
Bop diggy bop, d-dang d-dang diggy diggy
Bop diggy bop, d-dang d-dang dang

[Common]
Some pop, some lock, some move robotic
Like cash money I stay in pocket
U.M.C. r-r-r-rock, don't stop it
Chicks exotic, mix Hypnotic
Superhero role boy, I'm bionic
You a fad on some lumma-lumma supersonic
Girl you bout it, you can strip like comic
And trance to melodic Technotronic
Beats, knockin, seats, droppin
Seeds, poppin, streets, rockin
Freakin, shakin, money, makin
Stylin, and bein fly
I'm the one the ladies-ladies chose to
strip and pose to, take off their clothes to
Toast to the one that go coast to coast to
Mr. Global the focal, let's go, uhh

[Chorus]

[Common]
Uh, huh-uh
Uh, huh-uh
Get-get it
Get-get it
Get-get it

I am a ren-egade
I never been, afraid
Fresh and I'm get-tin paid
The future future of this age!
From the Chi so I talk this way
Twist the hay and the Grand Marnier
Rock the fly shit like every day
To the top and I'm on my way - let's go uhh

[Chorus]</pre>
