[Intro - Gwen Stefani and Andre 3000]
We've got a long way to go..
When snow hits the asphalt.
cold looks and bad talk come.
We've got a long way to go.
It's beyond Martin Luther..
upgrade computer..

[Andre 3000 and Gwen Stefani - who Andre is really tryna sound like Prince at the moment]
His/her skin wasn't the same color as mine
but she/he was fine, he/she was fine
If all men are made equal, then
he/she was fine, she/he was fine
Up until the time we went out on a date
I was fine, I was fine
Now I'm getting dirty looks I wonder what they'd say
if we were blind, we were blind peo-ple

[Chorus 2X]
We've got a long way to go..
When snow hits the asphalt, cold looks and bad talk come
We've got a long way to go.
It's beyond Martin Luth-er, upgrade comput-er

[Andre 3000 and Gwen Stefani]
Beauty is beauty, whether it's black or white
Yellow or green baby, you know what I meaaan
What if Picasso, only used one color?
There shouldn't be a rule how to choose your lover
Lovers in love is such a wonderful thing
Maybe in time we'll get together and sing
I really hope so, there's nothing wrong with this picture
We go a long way to go, we gotta get there quick-ERRRRRRRRRRRRRR

[Chorus 2X]

What color......is love?

What color.....is love?

What color.....is love?

[Chorus 2X]

[Martin Luther King Junior's "I Have A Dream" speech ]
.."that ALL men are created equal..."
"Children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by..."
"...the color of their skin..." "...but by the content of their character..."
"This will be the day when ALL God's children..."
"...will be able to sing with a new meaning..."
"...not only that..."</pre>
