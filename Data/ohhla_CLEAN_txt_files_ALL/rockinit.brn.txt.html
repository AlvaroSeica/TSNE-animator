[Chorus: Brand Nubian]
Sadat X be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
Lord J be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
Grand Puba be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
Rockin it (rockin the joint) rockin it
Uptown be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
Brooklyn be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
Now Rule be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
Rockin it (rockin the joint) rockin it

[Sadat X]
Budweiser in the daytime, Heineken after 9
Hit you record after record then, rhyme after rhyme
Chick went to FreakNik, came back like a slime
Tried to get me out in my youthful prime
This old timer on my block been there for 97 years
He seen them all when in they prime and at the end of they careers
He said, "Life comest first and remember love hurts
Keep a dollar in your pocket and the flame wit'cha name on it
Money don't flaunt it, live well and have a good life
Set up real estate, cool out, and find a good wife"
I enjoy mostly love but then there's hate
Tell a nigga wait he wanna grab off the plate
Upstate at the Motel 8 with cake
You debate this late, she was your prom queen date
Should I do it God? (Yo chill, she might got the trait)
Yeah you right Lord, I think I best to skate

[Chorus: Brand Nubian]
East coast be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
West coast be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
The whole world be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
Rockin it (rockin the joint) rockin it
All the Gods be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
And all the Earths be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
And all the Seeds be - rockin it, yes we be rockin it
Rockin it (rockin the joint) rockin it

[Lord Jamar]
The dreadlock, make yo' head rock, back and forth
Roll up, on the blunts and crack the quarts
We in the front, while y'all niggaz be the last resort
Took a trip to Japan and used my passport
Tried to flip on my man you lose your lifespan
Bruise emcees cause I'm too nice man
It's sorta like the dice in my hand, I be shakin up shit
Crackin motherfuckin heads when I hit
I used to go to bed with a girl from Sedgwick
Wanna start a family on some Sister Sledge shit
Tried to set me up, said I got her pregnant
When the bitch bust a nut yo I wasn't present
Nowadays I'm the cut, Brooklyn resident
Absorbin a burst of speed, from my Earth to Seed
Around the first 'til my hands bleed
And smoke weed 'til I'm lyin in a hearse over man's greed

[Interlude]
Brand Nubian back on the scene! (Yeah)
Paintin the pockets green (uhh, uhh)
One thousand jams strongs (c'mon)
So let's get it on, c'mon (dig it)

[Grand Puba - singing]
No one in the world can be us
No one in the world can see us
No one in the world can do it like Brand Nu baby

[Grand Puba - rapping]
Flow like pros, nuttin, can't stop it
Talk my talk and I walk with stuffed pockets
Breeze you with the blazing hot; then I'ma bounce
to something Diamond dropped, he play the tape until the tape popped
Word to life yeah dig it check a nigga's flow
No need to stress it cause it's tight like booty holes
Nubian fortified, just to satisfy
Squeeze one off, in a shorty, watch me multiply
Word to mother ask baby mother, about a brother
Top cat, can't be another
Rags to riches, I dig civilized chicks
Can't waste time on no stank attitude bitches
Brand Nubian sagas continue
Check the menu as we blow up the venue
So yeah cat it's like that and like that
Beat you in the head with that shit super fat, word up

[Outro: Brand Nubian]
