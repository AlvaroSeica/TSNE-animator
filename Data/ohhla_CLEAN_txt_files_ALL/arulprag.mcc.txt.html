As much as I love comic and these video games
I need a little something, not just any old dame
I need a little lady, make my life less lame
'cause the future's harder to say than M.I.A.'s last name
As much as I love comic and these video games
I need a little something, not just any old dame
I need a little lady, make my life less lame
'cause the future's harder to say than M.I.A.'s last name

I'm a snuggle bear, write poetry and blog a lot
in a hurry for a birdie I can snog a lot
I'm the kinda guy that you should get to know
Give you a neck message, make your vagina explode
I like pop punk, hip-hop and NPR
If I had a Huffy, you could ride the handlebars
Got some battle scars but that means I survived
Now I'm lookin' for a lady to walk by my side
Better like Boy meets World and Lost
Gotta have a little bit of soul, no WASPs
Red hair helps, keep those hips on lock
No fatties, no fuglies, I only hunt fox
Do you like Metal Gear, 'cause I wanna see your box
Do you like what you hear 'cause I got the bon motts
If you're a snuggle bear, got the cuddle onslaught
Yo, I rhyme about the booty, but I like it on top

As much as I love comic and these video games
I need a little something, not just any old dame
I need a little lady, make my life less lame
'cause the future's harder to say than M.I.A.'s last name
As much as I love comic and these video games
I need a little something, not just any old dame
I need a little lady, make my life less lame
'cause the future's harder to say than M.I.A.'s last name

Ooh-bop-sh-bop, my baby
Ooh-bop-sh-bop, my baby
Ooh-bop-sh-bop, my baby
Ooh-bop-sh-bop, my baby

You don't have to be a nerd, yo
Could you do the opera, could you do an Ergs show?
I step off the stage and I'm totally alone
Maybe's why I'm always runnin' to the 'dro
I need a counterpart, need a better half;
good sense of humor, yeah, you better like to laugh
'cause I'm always joking. See, the war gives me a rash
If you're not a democrat, then you can kiss my ass
Would you just be troublin', keep it bubblin' like a boulabaise?
Go to the VMAs, would you rock the T and A?
I need a cutie face, conversate for days
wake up in the morning, act like we're still on a date
And would you care, would you listen, would you love me for me?
Promise not to get jealous because my shit is so "leet"?
Stick with me through the thick and thin? I think that we should meet
Fuck the Boulevard of Broken Dreams, I got that shit beat

As much as I love comic and these video games
I need a little something, not just any old dame
I need a little lady, make my life less lame
'cause the future's harder to say than M.I.A.'s last name
As much as I love comic and these video games
I need a little something, not just any old dame
I need a little lady, make my life less lame
'cause the future's harder to say than M.I.A.'s last name

Ooh, Shalina, walkin' down the street, ten times a week
I said it, I meant it, I stole my momma's credit
I'm cool, smooth, hit me in the stomach one more time..

Down, down, baby, down by the roller coaster
Sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go
Down, down, baby, down by the roller coaster
Sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go
Down, down, baby, down by the roller coaster
Sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go
Down, down, baby, down by the roller coaster
Sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go!</pre>
