Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My shcool teacher told me
I never be shit
Swag so charmin
Now I'm the shit
Now I'm the dude
Every girl want to kiss on
Check my cool
Hater gon get your diss on
Used to put me out the club
Cause I wasn't old enough
Now they can't deny me
When they see that phantom rolling up
Purple kush I roll it up
Nigga I'm sky high
Hoes want to jump in
When they see my drive by
Now I drink by the cases
Till I throw up
You know what?
Bring another bottle
Let's get tore up
Cause I don't know when this shit can end
You only got one life to live
So toast muthafucka

I couldn't get girls
Man they used to diss us
Find me at the hottest club
Buying all the liquor
Fuck getting high flight pass me a swisser
They used to hate on me
But now I'm that nigga
I'm dat nigga
I'm dat nigga
You heard what I said bro
I'm dat nigga
Used to be broke
Now my pockets bigger
Ask around homie
I'm dat nigga

Six day plan acted like they didn't know me
Them same hoes playing games
Now they want to blow me
Use to seat in nose bleeds
Now we on the floor seats
Watching Lil Wil TNT
Want to show me
All the cameras flashing
Every time we step out
No mo commercial lighting
New York we bring them jets out
You ain't got to tell me homie
I know I'm da best out
You to hate them days
I was the odd man lefted out
Now I'm in everything
And I rock heavy bling
No mo layaway
Now I'm buying everything
Cause I don't know when this shit can end
You only got one life to live
So toast muthafucka

I couldn't get girls
Man they used to diss us
Find me at the hottest club
Buying all the liquor
Fuck getting high flight pass me a swisser
They used to hate on me
But now I'm that nigga
I'm dat nigga
I'm dat nigga
You heard what I said bro
I'm dat nigga
Used to be broke
Now my pockets bigger
Ask around homie
I'm dat nigga

Khleo
Ok
Swag so sick
I'm gon need an?
Flipping through dis girls
Like the pages in the magazine
Sidekick blowing up
IPhone steady ringing
Hit her one time
Then I got them all feening
Call me Khleo the D boy
But not slanging rocks
Slanging D so long
I got to tuck it in my socks
Came from nothing to something
And my verses be bumping
Money so Shaq
You money so munchkin
Hottest thing in LA
Name in everybody mouth
I'm the west coast thrid
So the ladies ride me out
Fitted cap low
Gucci shades on my face
L B Dub gang
For all you lames to see
Kle

I couldn't get girls
Man they used to diss us
Find me at the hottest club
Buying all the liquor
Fuck getting high flight pass me a swisser
They used to hate on me
But now I'm that nigga
I'm dat nigga
I'm dat nigga
You heard what I said bro
I'm dat nigga
Used to be broke
Now my pockets bigger
Ask around homie
I'm dat nigga</pre>
