Now that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about
Big up to A$AP Mob...

[A$AP Rocky]
Uh, lines - tell them read between it
Trippin' while I'm slippin', busy fightin' off these demons
Listen while I'm spittin', boy, you probably won't believe it
But, life is so terrific, tell them pinch me if I'm dreamin'
Revenues what I get, your bitch is what I did hit
And I'm bout my business
Them pesos what I did get, made a hit, had a fix, they sayin' "you's the shiznit"
Tell 'em get off my diznick, you bucket headed bitches
Crossin' all the lines, time is only racin' time
He put them to the bars so I'm only raisin' mine
Dependent on the grind is the only way to shine
So I'm feelin' like the Oz is the only state of mine
And it's finna give me peace, life up in these streets
Equipped with a piece case you niglets wanted beef (Yeah!)
Cuase man gave us laws, and God gave us time
It's the art of storytellin' and I'm only tellin' mine

[Chorus: Sarah Barthel]
The lines we've crossed (The lines we've crossed)
Have always been why I've lost
It changes all the time
Cause I've wondered how (I've wondered how)
I'm happier when I lose what I've needed all my life

[Big Boi]
(Talk that shit, Boi!)
Straight out of the belly of East Point, yeah, that's my origins
Was born in West Savannah, Georgia, then I was born again
Like the baby in the manger
I gave my life to Jes√∫s because he could protect me from the dangers
In the circle of angels, just to help me sign my halo
Attended Sunday school, but it felt like it was every day, though
I didn't have a suit or no fancy shoes, we went in our play clothes
Received the word and it molded me like Play-Doh
but nigga we don't play, though, we don't play, though
They say we get lower than an alligator's navel
And when I say "gator," I mean that gator that match that sable fur coat
I wish that PETA would thow some blood off on my furt folk 
Boi, ass whoopin'
They out'chea eatin flesh, but wanna worry bout how I'm lookin
I stay simply fresh to death
Sir Lucious Left Foot, best foot forward
You reap what you sow and now it's showin'

[Chorus: Sarah Barthel]
The lines we've crossed (The lines we've crossed)
Have always been why I've lost
It changes all the time
Cause I've wondered how (I've wondered how)
I'm happier when I lose what I've needed all my life

...

[Sarah Barthel]
All my life... (Repeat 3x)

[Chorus: Sarah Barthel]
The lines we've crossed (The lines we've crossed)
Have always been why I've lost
It changes all the time
Cause I've wondered how (I've wondered how)
I'm happier when I lose what I've needed all my life</pre>
