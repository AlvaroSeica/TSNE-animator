Song:   Streets Is Like (Clash of the Titans)
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Molly-Q]
You feel that? Yeah...

[Chorus 2X: Molly-Q]
Street is like clash of titans, word fighting
Thrill of victory, got you all uniting
Rainbow coalition, till you all re-lighting
City never sleeps, it's thunder and lightning

[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, it's the verbal assasinator, twenty six alternator
Black books and blueprints, any links
Hold scotch and arma' drinks, ice links, eye of the sphinx
With duel action, fifty green jackets
Pockets blender, Othorized the agenda
Wiganomics, you can me, Tony Soprano
Or a box of the Cuban cigars, Hector Hermano
Thugged out, my black in style be rare form
I stand like Saddam in a sand storm
Stand like slaves in a ship, like jews in the Holocaust
Crime boss in the fed pent, astouned like made men
Running at you, again and again

[Lighter Shade]
For pots and plots, school of hard knocks
Youngsters busting for props
Holding they cocks, I pick the lock at Fort Knox
Move militant, intelligent, dilligent soldiers
We hold as a dark light, get folded, rainbow colors
Two hours linking, where your verbal get slaughtered
Where your ties with four horsemen, stretched and caught
Left behind the torso, force flow, how the military killed ya morse code
Silence type violent, rock the purple heart like Randy Moss, yo
Joe Joe, mighty snow that folds the globe, we out of control
Iced out try this, I'm God, Godfather, Don Dada
Marijuana, backing the sequel
Fifth element, in my click, everyone's equal
Flat line ya people, crush ya titans of evil

[Chorus 2X]

[Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, my gun fire spit sharp, the dirty dungeon where the pits bark
Up in Park Hill, is where the chips start
Grand finale, I just got back from Cali
With a chunk of weed, and the drug game, is where they fight for green
Real cats, thugged out, and blood of winners
Who I am with, my Othorized team, I drop slang with
Niggas know me, don't you know Lounger Lo-ey
Silencer weed, puff trees up in the Pokey
And Jones smokey, that be my man layin' low key
You told the D.E., I got his back, plus he hold heat
I spit something, analyze cats, before we rip something
We them cats out to get something, nigga

[Molly-Q]
Sarcarsh and suffering catash, my life flash
Where titans rap, to clash my course, with another graph
In fact, I inflict the rap page, you insist
To test the cyber city, pump up your fist if you love this shit
The red carpet lyricist, Othorized with twin fists
I hit, abandon ship, armed and danged', I'm arrogant
Vocalist, we hold the medalist, worldwide, the poetrist
Fabulous, in the ghetto like Mack 10, pen spreads
Straight across the paper and action, crack lens
Entourage charged, crowd be marking large
We want, cut through the parmagene, we ghetto Gods
Talk violent, tear up on ya ass, calling me rash
Cash on door, past course, having flash thoughts
Your fortress, matress, I flipped it, you panicked
Dramatic front page of the advance, the average kid
Split you apart, word to word, eating adverbs
Shittin' no less, paragraph giving heart burn
Seventh inning stretch armstrong, leave the bench warmed
Staying mad walls, pave my waves with asphalt

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
