Song:   What You Think
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Timbo King]
What you think? I make you sink in to my lower dungeon
Become a cell prisoner, my Royal Fam is coming
You silly mortal, I chop heads offa backstabbers
Inflictin' pain, I remain, my rap shatters
Strategic moves, every plan must be documented
I'm in your face, poppin' shit, I'mma knock you in it
The king ruler, busting off like a German luger
My date of entry, is better than a new computer
I keep it rugged like a busted fade
Lyrics are custom made, vocabulary top upper grade
Than others, brothers are fake like forgery
You still sound watery, checks come quarterly
Words be squirting at the speed of light
Forty days and forty nights, I be burnin', earning Royal stripes
Expertise, I be wildin' like the Middle East
When I release, I be aiming for ya front piece

[Chorus 2X: Timbo King]
What you think, is the question that I'm askin'
Mind over matter, brain power, everlasting
Is it phat, or is it wack, or just passing
What you think, is the question that I'm askin' (what you think?)

[Timbo King]
My clarity is much clearer than a windshield
Fucking up MC's, from New York to Israel
I go the distance like an eight cylinder
Cold killin' ya, I be the vocal superior
One rap'll just crack your whole head of lettuce
You get sliced up, diced up, by Royal shredders
No sense is your best defense, first soaked and rinsed
You're washed up, cuz you're past tense
I stay hungry, I'm a starving artist
Royal Fam's the hardest, king size, I be the world's largest
Indeed, I'm puffin' weed through a chalice
The head knocker, I'm leaving foes unbalanced
Royal men, we keep moving like chess pieces
I got support, I've been taught by the best teachers
I'mma allergic to ya wackness, the fact is
You're boring, you be raining, huh, I be pouring

[Chorus 2X]

[Timbo King]
I come in handy like a book of matches
Sharp like twenty axes, cuz I pay King's County taxes
Crown supporter, living in a Black Castle
Ghetto fortress, soldiers comin' at you
We maintain, a full house with the same name
Leaving the industry, branded with a Royal stain
Disgusted, I be flushing like a deck of cards
Through nooner, my lyrics got the winning odds
Ill thoughts make me kill all sorts of men
Penetrate with strength, Royal is forcing in
Five pound fists aiming at ya watermelon
Ten offa bean, on the scene, you just thought of selling
Hittin' ya weakspots, my props is legendary
I deal with knowledge first, such and such is secondary...

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Timbo King]
What you think...
Mind over matter..
Is it phat?....
What you think, is the question that I'm asking (what you think?)
What you think...
Mind over matter..
Is it phat?....
What you think, is the question that I'm asking (what you think?)</pre>
