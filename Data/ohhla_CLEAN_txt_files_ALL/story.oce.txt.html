[O.C.]
Timmy wanted a name, tryin to gain fame like a skeezer
Robbed the spot and stole ice from the freezer
He's a fool, cause he went in without a mask on
Now he's on the run so he dipped to Nebraska
Hasn't crossed his mind, his girl named Olivia
She'll talk the fall for the jump from Bolivia
Asides that, he fat, livin on his own-ah
Diminshed the friendship style, now a loner
Relaxed while his family is gagged and tied up in New York
Askin them, to confess his whereabout
No one fesses up so the Columbian scores a blister
Shovin up a broomstick to his sister

[Chorus *whispered*]
Believe it or not.. (3X)
Believe it or not, believe it or not..

[O.C.]
Everyone screams like hell souls are damned
Mommy gives up cries like bleacher's bed fans
The experience was 'aww shit' like movie flicks
But the men inside they treat, the women like tricks
One beats his meat, the other Columbian he pounds mommy down
the longer Timmy stays out of town
You get tortured, all of your babies and on no slackin for
the nigga disses so he insists return
He knows little of the pain that the family endure
Still he deal his disease for sure
He had a cure far worse like candy kids steal from a store
Livin off his heist like a crack whore

[Chorus] - 2X

[O.C.]
Check it out
Enough of the games one said, butt open high
Started with ma, gave her a Columbian necktie
Doin the daughter far worse, I tell
Pullin her skin back slow, peels off her toenails
Raw skin exposed plus Gus that wasn't all
They drenched her feet, with a whole lot of alcohol
The babies were baked, like cakes in the oven
No remorse was governed, in their hearts was stone cold nothin
He lacked love for his fam, obvious ain't it
He traded blood for money, just readin
picked up a local newspaper and paid it; family slain - drug related
He stood stiffer than a patient bein sedated
Face still blew upon on it like wind
Instead of you they took it out, on your last line of kin
And now a sour taste devour your breath, what's left
is a thief that had his family tortured to death

[Chorus] - 2X
