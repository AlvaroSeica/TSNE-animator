[Intro: Trinidad James] + (T.I.)
Yeah, you already know man
It's your boy, T. James
Ain't doing a verse on my shit, I already killed it
Let the legends holla at ya, Tip
(Yeah, I'm talking true A-town trap shit, ya understand that?)
(It the motherfuckin' king homeboy, hey Trinidad, dig this homes; ay, c'mon)

[T.I.]
Big bank, all I do is get bank (okay)
Niggas hatin' on me but they bitch ain't
So conceited, I don't think my shit stank (uh-uh)
400,000 dollars on a Mulsanne (leh'go)
Come and kick it with a west side nigga
Think I ain't about that action, wanna bet my nigga?
All day thumbing through the check my nigga (hey)
Boy you're broke, you can't even be a threat my nigga
When you're talking to me say it with your chest little nigga
I pull up on your set and make a mess little nigga
Okay, I got a kilo of gold 36 O's
Wrapped around the neck of a dope boy
Gold yacht, that's the presi' diamond in those
And just paid cash for a Rolls Royce (hey)
A true trap nigga, I done sold everything
+Trouble Man+, Hustle Gang, all gold everything
Hahahaha...
I said +Trouble Man+, Hustle Gang, all gold everything

[Young Jeezy]
(JEEZY! Leh'go) 
Bought a gold bottle now we on the Dom (on the Dom)
Big faced Rollie take up half my arm (DAAAMN)
Porsche 911 with the Gabby top (Gabby top)
All gold scale, that's my magic box
Got the soft (soft), my nigga (my nigga)
Give me thirty minutes, I'll be right with ya
Got the hard (hard), my nigga (my nigga)
Let me whip this here I'll get it right to ya
Goddamn (goddamn), I'm turnt up (turnt up)
I think the knob just broke and I don't give a fuck
Goddamn (goddamn), I'm fucked up (fucked up)
The streets dry as hell, this work high as fuck (let's go)
She want white, boy, dudes take it easy man (easy man)
Shit I'd pay less for a pair of Yeezy's man (Yeezy's man)
All I wanna know if I'mma bounce with her 
Talking me to death like I'm a counselor
She popped a Molly I'm guessing (WOO)
But if she throwing the pussy I'm catching (WOO)
.223 with a silencer
Gonna rock that shit with the flyest fur (haha)
All gold like Montana (Tony)
Hoes all in my phantom (Rollies)
Young done killed the gold remix
A nigga don't like it, goddamn him (Young)

[Chorus: Trinidad James]
Gold all in my chain (chain), gold all in my ring (ring)
Gold all in my watch (watch), don't believe me, just watch - nigga nigga nigga
Don't believe me, just watch (watch), don't believe me, just watch - nigga nigga nigga
Don't believe me, just watch (watch), don't believe me, just watch (watch)
Gold all in my chain (chain), gold all in my ring (ring)
Gold all in my watch (watch), don't believe me just watch (watch)

[2 Chainz]
2 CHAINZ~!
Ibn all on my head (head), snakeskin all in my hat (hat)
Hit your girl with my chains on so that's gold all on her back (tell em)
Gold all on my watch (watch), so big it's like a clock (yeah)
Some people wear fox fur, on the Source cover I wore a fox (damn)
This for all the DJ's that got this on REPLAY..
I sell a brick on eBay, then I celebrate, several bitches in every state
I'm in Miami with Wayne trying to skate, my family straight
Ayo, ho 'bout to hyperventilate, I owe her one, we did a 68
I say hoes, my nigga, them ain't red bottoms, her bottom brown
I'm smoking strong, my nigga, I'm on loud, not Bobby Brown
That's souf side up in here, I spell "souf" with a F
F stand for fuck y'all if you ain't fucking with my set (Tru)
Fuck with me and I'm bustin' (bow), fuck with me and I'm bustin' (bow)
Every time you see me think about what it would be if I ain't do nothing
Damn right, I'm stuntin' (stuntin') damn right, I'm stylin' (stylin')
Just got a girl chauffeur and we on a motorcycle and she driving (ERRRT)
This Versace, that Versace, this Versace, too
I got killers watchin', niggas watchin', bitches watchin' me too (goddamn)
See I'm on lean, on loud, and I got my own lane
You need to mind your own business, it's 2 Chainz and Trinidad {James}

[Chorus] - minus last two lines

[Outro: Trinidad James]
A'int shit changed, I still don't fuck with fuck niggas
And if you a fuck nigga I'm talking 'bout you
Your bitch said she popped a molly, she sweating
WOOOOOOO..... A-Town bitch~! </pre>
