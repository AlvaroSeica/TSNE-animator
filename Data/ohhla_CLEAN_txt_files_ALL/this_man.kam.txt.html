[Chief Kamachi]
Yo, most peoples life control, by the things they worship
But my soul ain't for Shaitan's purchase
I remember being young, grandmoms telling me to keep silent
In the churches but my inner searches
Went beyond scriptural verses
And giving the Preacher bills from her purses
Cuz what was real was the jails
And the bodies that sailed in the hearses
Abandoned cribs, with no operating circuits
The pain not able to get your children ticket for the Circus
Never leave the hood, to the masses bigger as the Earth is
Now the Angels at your service
To guide you to happiness and help you sense a higher purpose
The truth is the Savior is at the end of your own arm
You do anything to eat and the world say you so wrong
Cultural elements, the root of emotional derailments
To lead to the eyes failed princess looking thru jail friends
And use to park Benzes, but ended up on park benches
C'mon

Yo, I'm the eldest, a five sibling split up
So don't ask me why the L's is lit up
And I'm still tryna wonder why the hell I get up?
But I just can't seem to give up against the Earth and this cruelty
Hell is grudge, but these streets I fell in love
But than I seldom rub the wicked body of bells and bub
In the hood trap, and they tryna derail the sub
After the hammer drop, then there's nothing to tell the judge
See the pen coming; hear the state bus running often tryna tuck something
We grizzling but end up in the prison yard whistling
On death row looking for protestors and petitions
Listen to the words of a scattered musician
Who speaks for the youth caught in a loop
Living a lawless truth for a faluce
Their minds is loose, and it's never a time for truce
In these jungles we die for our fruits
See the police eyeing our troops
Eating steaks and french fries on the stoop
With a buck 25 and a Goose
Hustling like we don't see no white guys on the roof
But that's the risk you take when it's a nighttime on the duce- sing

This Man

[Chief Kamachi]
Yo these are jewels for an Honest Abe
After I sit down and contemplate
I was so hurt by my mama's fate
Knowing her son about to dominate
And she can blow out the candles on her promised cake
And endure a finer place
That's why I stay with a piranha face
In search of gold fish, nurtured from a soul dish
Look at the way the streets oppression mold us
Corrupted mommies press their soldier
I grew up with the Avenue in me
Plus I picked up the habits of plenty
Thorough young boy, the old heads said they'd give me
Everything from revolvers to semi to dope
Tryna stay afloat, it's easy to stray away from hope
When everyday is broke, looking back at 58th and Pascle Ave
When I was playing tag in my lil rascal rags
