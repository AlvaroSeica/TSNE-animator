[Big Pooh]
Imagine, if this was the last rhyme I ever wrote
The last words that I ever spoke, NO
I'm a keep servin them
Cause its somebody out there, that never even heard of him
Or the songs I be murdering
Now it's a whole herd of men that follow in his footstep
I did it all to get a rep and it worked out
Now my sisters kirk out when they hear me on the radio
Here we go with the steady flow
I'm the best since sliced bread but you already know
How it goes when, me and Te be composing
Over instrumentals 9^th holding
We not hot niggaz scolding, I told men
But it's only now you want to listen
So get close, please pay attention
Here's a few things I'd like to mention
The B the I the G the P the O the O the H
The is none greater
The L the B the J the L
Is here forever money so see me later
Stash away plenty sheets of paper
Shit is perfected and we hit the majors
See, I said you niggaz couldn't cage us
Them mere feeble attempts was outrageous
It aint a party 'til we hit the stages
Rapper Pooh signing off, see you in the funny papers
Ha, you can bet your life on it, you gon see me man come on

[Phonte] (Busta Rhymes repeats, "Oh my god!")
Rock, Rock and you don't
Freak, Freak and you don't
To the Beat and you don't
Its unique and you don't
You think I will but I won't, stop
They think I will but I won't, stop

Rock, rock and you don't
Freak, freak and you don't
To the beat and you don't
Its unique and you don't
Big Pooh and he don't stop
And 9th Wonder he don't stop

[Phonte]
Even though, most of our albums are poorly promoted
And all the magazines probably won't even quote it
J League never running or folding
We got tight to steal y'all spotlight and y'all won't even know it
One time for Big Pooh cause he quit eating steak
And two times for 9^th Wonder cause he setting it straight
And 3 times to that hoe from the 8-1-4
That moved in, got kicked out and caught on tape (ha,ha)
Just a little bit of time, is all that we granted on this planet
For us to get our little bit of shines
If y'all want to get a line, then talk to BIG DHO
Cause aint shit free but the spirit of my rhymes
I hear it all the time, LB aint on the same ?
So innovative you the next best things, since, whateva
I just laugh wit it, cause today's fan is tomorrow's rap critic
One day they giving you the thumbs up the next
They telling 9^th to go on switch his drums up the best
Is what they expect, but why they won't let the music
Just be what it is is anybody's guess, so ah
If y'all feeling this y'all aint gotta analyze it
This shit is dope so we aint changin' up
Makin' money and our parents aint ashamed of us
And when I think about that I can't complain as much so let it rock.

Raleigh gotta
Durham gotta
Chapel Hill gotta
Greensboro gotta
High Point gotta
Got a zone

Its for all y'all man

Rock, rock and you don't
Freak, freak and you don't
Its unique and you don't
To the beat and you don't
Think I will but I won't, stop
Think I will but I won't, stop

Rock, rock and you don't
Freak, freak and you don't
To the beat and you don't
Its unique and you don't
Think I will but I won't, stop
They think I will but I won't, stop

Phonte is the sho shot
Big Pooh and you don't stop
9th Wonder got the beat the sho' shot
LB is on the beat and you don't stop</pre>
