and I brought some friend in with me

[Slim]

and mr kyane west is on the beat:
Its been alot of talk bu here to set the record straight

[Chorus]
my wife
my wife
my queen
my queen
your the one that I like ohhhhh
shorty do what you do for me!!!

[Nick Cannon]
hey girl I know I said that I'm not your man
but Cannon got plans to but a rock on your hand
I'm in the same color phantom
as rotten banans we split
know we goin to the champalane
wanna get married
cold feet wanted to scear me
I told her that was for tha brids but she want a kaneri
got ten karats rock and em no lie
promise to stay monogamous - I'll try
but off that Patron anything can happen
That's Can, Slim, and Kanye that got you dancin
got the hold block full of cops and ambulances
ma I keep my pockets fat like hammer pantsess

[Chorus]
my wife
my wife
my queen
my queen
your the one that I like ohhhhh
shorty do what you do for me!!!

shorty its macamoni
not machamoni so imma need a lab dance at the bachlaor party
yo I read on the internet that we was endin it
but thats rummor we friend with beifits
lil mama you my pride and joy all
them chicks on the side they not important
I know pimpin aint eazy but I'm tired of horin
sorda like when jordan retried of scorin
sorda like when clif got tried of lurran
we brake up but ma you know we gone make up
way that that ass shake you hard to stay away from words cant explain so slim just sang on em

[Chorus]
my wife
my wife
my queen
my queen
your the one that I like ohhhhh

yo kyane make em rock to this
you know a player in his time like optamis
transforming from a pimp to monogasit
with chicks runnin through my mind like john mawkavich
top the whole last name up swich that game
gotta rock so big she can't lift her finger
I wonder if you had Eddie Murphy +Boomerang+ ya
LaFace but she a east coast gangsta
with a body like an adomodapiea
tight make ya say I don't wanna prenaup
whyfo shorty you got money to
so lets skip the wedding and go straght to the honeymoon

[Chorus]
my wife
my wife
my queen
my queen
your the one that I like ohhhhh
shorty do what you do for me!!!

[Nick Cannon]
put your cups up

It's the new wedding anthem
to the left do it do it do it
to the right do it do it do it
do what ya like

[Chorus]
my wife
my wife
my queen
my queen
your the one that I like ohhhhh
shorty do what you do for me!!!</pre>
