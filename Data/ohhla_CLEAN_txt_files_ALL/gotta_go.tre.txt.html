[Intro: Trey Songz]
Good evening
I'd like to thank everybody for comin out
Hope your flights were safe
Feelin real breezy, swift like the wind

[Trey Songz]
It's callin my body
It's callin my soul
It's callin my mind
So girl I gotta go
Baby it's the grind
Yes I had a good time (don't get me wrong)
You were so good
And I really wish I could
Stay a little bit longer
Love you a little bit stronger (heh)
And go a little deeper
baby with you
But since this thing is callin, I
gotta answer dry your eyes
Girl don't cry
cause your makin it hard for me

[Chorus]
Cause I don't want to leave (ooh girl)
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down (I don't wanna)
I don't want to leave, no no no
But girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it

[Trey Songz]
So hold that thought (that thought) uh
Don't you move
See I'm comin right back, heh
Right back for you
Don't you change your position
Girl I'm on a mission
And baby trust I'll be missin
Missin you, cause I don't wanna leave

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Trey Songz]
Streets be callin me
They be calllin my name
And when they call, I gotta go
So I'm lettin you know
I wont be gone for long
And already I can't wait to come home to you

[Chorus] - 2X

[Trey Songz]
Break it down now, ow
Nah~! I don't wanna leave
But you know how it is when
Whoa, baby, keep that on
Don't take it off
Keep in on
So I can take it off
when I come back, heh
Yeah fo' sho
You better believe in that

[Chorus] w/ ad libs</pre>
