Song:   My Cloud
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Catch me where the red ferns grow
smokin' bud that burns slow
So turn the damn dial
if your speakers turned low
'Cuz everything I'm doin is loud
I'm just chillin on a motha fuckin cumulus cloud
I stay high

Up in the galaxy like pluto nash
stupid ass thinkin any one in your crew's gon' last
but you knew those facts
I'm the dog that whipped pugos ass
Fat bud call it sumo grass

So you better give me kutos fast
won't stop till I got that Borat n Bruno cash
I'm a box office success
puffin' the best
got that Godzilla, green
same color as Shrek

So lets throw it in a dutchy or philly or E Z Wider
bong, bowl, bubbler, hookah, or vaporizer
Maybe throw yourself a batch of brownies in
as long as we be gettin' high count me in, ay!

[Chorus]

I'm just livin' on a cloud
chillen in the sunshine
I got a dub n a dutch
I think its blunt time
Eyes bloodshot, contacts dry
wear my sunglasses even when I'm inside

I'm high
like the THC in my system
my weed is Medicin
i need it for livin
I twist up my words
while I speed up the rhythm
because I be high as fuck
'n I don't need your permission

I'm twistin
burnin' on a cloud
smokin on a joint that would make Bob Marley proud
Jam with the buffalo soldiers
chillen let me stir it up
Trench town rockin on a beat then I burn it up

You better learn your stuff be ware
I'm just a kid who didn't pay attention and dare
I've been high all day since eighth grade
stay blazed off that grade A haze and AK
ay!

[Chorus]

Rollin up an eighth of grass
any time I blaze a track
'cuz I stay burnin like a fuckin pyromaniac
Keep atleast an ounce where I'm stayin at;
dutch in the whip
puffin some piff
who fuckin with chris?
(Nobody)

Anywhere I go
you know I got some pot
green with orange hair like Roger Klots
Got that carrot top drop
no stems no seeds
takin bong rips to see if u can OD

But you can't
all you get is cough 'n real hungry
tearin' the fuck outta the fridge with the munchies
Pass out in boxers
infront of the tv then
wake up at like three PM

Then its wake n bake time
so roll yourself a joint
'cuz if ur not high
then whats the fuckin' point?
My heads in the clouds
I'll never be sober
I'll be a pot head till its over
closure

[Chorus]</pre>
