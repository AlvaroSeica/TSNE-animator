[Intro - J. Cole - talking]
Yeah, hey
Cole World
Hmm, hey

[Chorus 1 - J. Cole]
Got a dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So, if it's about that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream
Just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
Cole, walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind, I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
'Cause I still don't see hope, lookin for a quick fix
When everyone I see's broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowin it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin niggaz, over a decade they been knowin me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got 'em
They say he wouldn't leave me, yet I'm fallin like it's autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you on your last dollar
And the, stress of this mess you in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin, now the only thing you grow's old
Or do you flip that fuckin dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a King (Cole ...)

[Break - J. Cole] (*echo*)
Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy, just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen po'
Mr. "Dollar And A Dream" in case ya ain't know

[Chorus 2 - J. Cole]
It's all a nigga got
So if it's about that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream
Just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggaz strung out, you spaghetti
Ya paper confetti, small time, y'all on one, I'm on mine
You logged off, 'cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggaz make sure that money right and then I rip the show
I run the town, they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin hard shit, dummies rappin smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares when niggaz scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies, who infiltrated my team
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin, I'm wastin your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't outsmart me
I let you feel like you the shit but boy you can't out fart me
Ya never, have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If ya don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, go on and stack a million
And as soon as I do, mama that nine to five is through
And I know I ain't been callin but I'm thinkin 'bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
'Cause this life gets hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin but I do
But I suck it up for who? My fans and my mans
Who probably never, ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin brain from a bitch and thinkin "God damn, what's her name?"
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
Then my other side kick in like "bitch, don't be so fuckin lame"
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those prayin for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will (Cole)

[Break] - w/ ad libs

[Chorus 2]

[Outro - J. Cole - talking]
Hey, 'cause nigga that's life and trust me I'm livin
Look what a nigga made out the shit that I was given
Look what a nigga made out, look what a nigga made out
Got a dollar and a dream, three</pre>
