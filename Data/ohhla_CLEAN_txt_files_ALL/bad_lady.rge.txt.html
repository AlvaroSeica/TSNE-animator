Typed by: OHHLA.com

In the middle like Monie 
You're phony cause your styles bologna 
But I rock with no filler, ain't a girl m.c. illa - puttin' 
Rappers on ice, then lock the body in a chilla 
The way I fucks it up, I upchuck nasty style like 
Throwup blow up, then go nuts 
Like a lady Ninja killa 
I'll drill deep beneath the surface 
It's the Rage, front page, I heat up like a furnace 
My stelo gots bulk 
Check the gamma rays from the she Hulk 
Stomping through your territory 
New rap female category 
Winner, and your style gets played out like the 
Spinners 
Not a soprano, or alto, the Rage is a tenor 
My voice is just right - I bust hypodermics to your 
Inner minds eye 
Makin' you hip-hop junkies wanna fly 
Like eagles, my stlye sharp as cathedral steeples 
Showin' &amp; proving even a lady can be diesel 
So uh - breaka, breaka, you best keep on truckin' unh 
Unh roll on with that chicken shit your cluckin' 
Your stuck in stupid you dufis - I'm hittin so hard 
I'm knockin' out your 
Toofis - or teefis(believe this) 
You butthead you'll get played out like Beavis 
Receive it, it's yours Lyrical murdera - still rockin on 

(Hook) 
2Pac/Makaveli: 
Rock on, rock on - The Lady of Rage lyrical murdera 
The baddest lyricist born(1x) 

Now I'm a explosive vocalist, make you readjust your 
Focus, no hocus-pocus, no bogus, I'm the dopest 
Lyrically the locest it's all copacetic 
I see through your synthetics with my telekinetics 
I mean my telepathics from this mouth of madness 
Flows one of the baddest 
In my exsistence, my 
Exsistence is prevalent, hesitant not you'll get dropped 
I'm rhymin' so hard I see it knocking out snot, cause I 
Slam like colloision so your vision of me 
Is you can't touch not even a smidgen of me - you're 
Pigeon shit to me 
So drop it(damn - hit this shit Rage) 
I take a puff then I blow like Moby 
Runnin lyrics quicker than Toby 
What's my name? Yeah you know me 
(Rage lyrical murdera, what's my name? Yeah you 
Rage lyrical murdera, yeah you know me) 
So if you wanna see me turn on your headlights, I'll 
Make you run red ligths 
Trying to catch it 
Slam into the Rage you'll end up wreckage 
Towed away, blowed away, cut down, mowed away 
Curled up like Ola Ray 
So let me straighten it out cause I'm a thrilla 
Mutha fuckin' MC cold killa 
When I drop that you better drop back dat you hop back 
I rock dat till dawn 
Yes I still rock on 

(Hook) 
2Pac/Makaveli: 
Rock on, rock on The Lady of Rage lyrical murdera the 
Baddest lyricist born(2x) 

Now when it comes to the hippest in hip-hop 
I make the lips drop kness knock 
Buckle and shake, now who's to the wrong 
Move - get dusted - busted 
Wack MC's who can't cut the mustard 
I stick it to you like voodoo so who do you think 
You're foolin 
Yot Rick but rulin' 
You can't hang with the noose, your goose will get 
Cooked 
Look up in the sky it's fly Robin fly 
Givin whatever sutis you 
Got the size 8 timberland, to boot cha oops 
Up side your head, a yo I'm seein red 
Like a bull baby I got to pull, of an ox Redd Foxx 
Couldn't out fox me, because I'm Foxy lite Brown 
Unh, break it down now, from the end to the start 
Lyrical murdera pumps fear in heart 
I'm tearin parts to pieces like Reeses 
I freaks it, speak it in tongues put you on like Bonita 
AppleBum 
You can't see me you blind to the fact I'm all that 
Swingin in the wack strikin' 'em out like bats 
Hats off blast off watch me rock it sock it to ya 
Whatever it takes to do ya done top gun 
It's The Lady of Rage still rated number one 
Muthafucka!
