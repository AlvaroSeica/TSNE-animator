[Intro: Popa Chief]
Baby, oh baby, it's bigger...
It's bigger... than the both of us
Put together... I can't stand it...
I can't take it... baby...

[Chorus: Popa Chief]
It's bigger than the both of us, I can't get close enough
You beef too much, you riff too much

[Popa Chief]
You bitch too much, whoa, easy, rewind, come again
Is this the end of the road, that's the question
Yes, no, maybe, so, before I let you go, I'd rather chop off my afro
That's the straw, that broke the camel's back
I ain't too proud to beg, baby, believe that
So all that and then some, bless your beauty and wisdom
You're my muffin, my stuffing, without you, I am nothing
My heart hurts like it was hit by a ton of bricks
Am I your rooster, are you my chick?
I smoke a pound of rank and I drink a case of brew
And I'm still stuck on you like glue

[Chorus 2X]

[Popa Chief]
You had a good thing, but you just couldn't hold on
Couldn't wait for me to put my Superman suit on
I started making moves, but by then, you left me
Didn't know that your wimpy, would turn into a Hefty
This is dedicated, to them stuck up hoes
Faking for real, now you wanna come back, cuz I got
A deal, how you sound, how you feel
Now I'm with your girl, so chill...

[Interlude: Popa Chief]
It's bigger than the both of us, I can't get close enough
It's bigger than the both of us, I can't get close enough
It's bigger than the both of us, I can't get close enough
It's bigger...
Whoa, easy, rewind, come again
Whoa, easy, rewind, come again
Whoa, easy, rewind, come again
Come again

[Chorus]

[Outro: Popa Chief]
You had a good thing, but you just couldn't hold on
You couldn't hold on, stop sweating the techniques back
Now I got my Popa Chief suit on, yeah, yeah, yeah
I went from rags to riches, another talk of the town
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ectetera, ectetera, ride off into the sunset
Rags to riches, mud bones and fly bitches
It's bigger than the both of us...</pre>
