Ay, I pull birds my nigga
I'm pullin' birds
I'm pullin' birds my nigga
I love birds birds birds birds
Birds

[Rasaq]
And I'm talkin' bout the goods
The ones that come in hurds, when I pull up to the curb
Birds, I might let her sip some syrup
Girl don't ya know, it's good for ya hips and curves
Birds, and I ain't talkin' bout the kind that chirp
It's the kind that's gettin' on a niggaz nerves
Birds, and I ain't talkin' bout the drugs
It's the kind that show me love, cuz I'm rollin' on dubs
Birds, some in the hood, some in the burbs
Some talk country, some use proper words
I get em, I hit em, I dismiss 'em
Don't hug em, don't love em, I don't kiss 'em
She love em, she hug em, she don't listen
The jewelz glisten, call me an adittion
Cuz if ya look around my sleeve, you might see two pigeons
I flip em, then flick em, don't trick 'em
Just trick em, she wishin', she wit 'em
She wishin', she get em, she pissed n she trippin
He spittin', he flippin', no trickin, no spendin, no dissin'
Just send her back home, with a bent back bone
Skirt the last gone, and then I'm back home
Lookin' for mo to mack on, lights camera action

I love birds birds birds birds
I love birds birds birds birds
I love birds birds birds birds</pre>
