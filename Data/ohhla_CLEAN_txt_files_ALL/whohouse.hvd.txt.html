Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
Who's in the house? (The Overweight Lover's in the house) {*3X*}
Who's in the house? (The Overweight Lover Heavy D)

[Heavy D]
Rip tip tip top, ting-a-ling-a-ling-lop
When I'm at home, my phone ring-a-ling-a-lings a lot
There's only one way to knock a boot, and I'm a boot knocker
Not Orville Redenbacher, but I'm a punani popper
Slick like oil, (w)rap like aluminum foil
When I'm hot, I'm hot, so watch me boil
Easy on the tiptoe, slow flow, peace to D.O.C. yo
Rachel here I go go
Here comes the Heavster (yeah yeah yeah)
Tell me if you like it (yeah yeah yeah)
I can rock a party and bounce a party
Rock a party, bounce a party, rock a party bounce a party
Captain {?} back on a fat track
Mack here to pack and I'm a light-skinned, black
You know what I'm about, I'm out, so find a new route
Cause I got the answer to the question - who's in the house?

[Chorus]

[Heavy D]
I never run, I never ran, cause I'm not the running man
I can do more than one, so call me Toucan/two-can Sam
I'm smooth, so call me Mr. Parkay
I parlay, around the way, ev-ery day, HEY!
Some flip scripts, but I flip books
for good looks, a crazy hook, and that's all it took
UH~! I'm the Boogie Woogie Man, the boogie bugle boy
Ain't nothin fuddy duddy, nutty like an Almond Joy
Lightskinned, like, my high tops flat
Mack on the map, knock knock who is that?
It's the one you love, the one you feel the need for
Slow down, clown, the one to watch your speed for
Ready or not, not ready enough, to be
You're pretty not steady not ready enough for Heavy D
You know what I'm about, I'm out, so find a new route
Cause I got the answer to the question - who's in the house?

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Heavy D] - over dub version of Chorus
On the breakdown {*4X*}
Break it down, break it down
Check it

[Heavy D]
Come and get a little bit, a tidbit, a tasket
A tisket, before your ask it, don't even risk it
Frisk it, before you're feelin it, know who you're dealin with
To get to the point, cover your joint, make sure you're concealin it
I love a pretty tongue natural suntan sandal
Hair dangle, easy to handle
Kind of girl who's single, ready to mingle
Flavorful like a Pringle, never used to jingle
Here comes the Heavster (yeah yeah yeah)
Tell me if you like it (yeah yeah yeah)
I can rock a party and bounce a party
Rock a party, bounce a party, rock a party bounce a party
Don't need a hippy dippie hide a hickie stripper mickie
tricky flippy sticky icky out for a quickie, quickie
You know what I'm about, I'm out, so find a new route
Cause I got the answer to the question - who's in the house?
