[Verse 1]
Body bag, body bag
Photo them, they don chopped his ass
No parol, but the poll I got, they done dropped his ass
No toll, headshot, gave his whole top a tag
Drama act, in da cut were llamas at, copy cat
Coppas on my ass and shit
Ain't do it , innocent
Niggas know my resume, 30 poppa Bebe kid
You don't know who Bay Bay is
4 six, Woodlawn
OTF the family, even my barber tapin' shit
Uzi spit
Got a deal, coolin with my movie bitch
Movie clip, for a op nigga or a goofy bitch
Get hit from my groopie bitch
You wiffin hoes, you losin' it
Thinkin' you aluminum, you would get scratched, bad, homicide
Police said my baby shy
Sup lo, before your ass was born I saved a 100 thou
Daddy on his savage shit, you know that boy be whillin out
You know I'm bring savage out
Lurkin like why they hiddin out
Drama life, but my whole family told me to calm it down
Bro and them gotta be bonding now
Me and my bitch we bonding now
No cass, but that mac I got that bitch work condom style
I spit crack like bobby brown
They know I'm a problem child
Wiffin
We don't do that shit, that shit be tifflin
Cause the same bitch that eat the clit like she dikin
Love ya hoes, but the same bitch we put the pipe in
She suckin dick, thats the same bitch you give that night kiss
Sucka, your ass was sucka, super man
If I can't make you dance I bet that uzi can
Backflip
If you front your move when that mac spit
All I know is drill, drill, drill on my pac shit

Yea [x3] (I'm back in!)

[Verse 2]
My shootas gonna shoot some shit
Ruthless shit
Cause we do this shit
Backas on some spooky shit
Droppin shit
We gon do some shit
Red light, red tape
Got couple L on some goofy shit
Goofy niggas claiming shit
Niggas ain't even do this shit
OTF 300 300 know that be GBE
Body count with that ozi on the top cause we stay in the league
Don't lack

No Chris Paul my Clippers give him 3
You betta at tennessee
I ain't talking tennessee
Massacre
Robbin shit
Masked up like I'm dracula
Mobbin shit, no Gucci Mane, niggas know that we cashin up
Twist her with the blinky its black and it spins fast as fuck
Niggas rapped a life time, who'd eva thought I'd pass em' up
I'm from west hide and we gang bang
When shortie be postin in cuts in the gang ways
Crangin niggas, pussy as niggas call em rangin niggas
Free my nigga rechi rich, he be so quick to change a nigga</pre>
