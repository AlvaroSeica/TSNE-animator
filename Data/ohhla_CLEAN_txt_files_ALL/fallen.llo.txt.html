[Intro: Carlton Fisk]
Yeah, man
Yeah, rest in peace to all my niggaz, man
That died, hell yeah, man
Y. Million, 2 Cent, I love y'all niggaz
(Gon' rep for y'all niggaz)
Shut ya mouth when the cops come, nigga, let's go!

[Chorus: Carlton Fisk]
Tribute for the fallen soldiers
This is a tribute for the fallen soldiers
This is a tribute for the fallen soldiers
This is a tribute for the fallen soldiers

[Lounge Lo]
I hit the dice game, rolled a six and took the gwop
Told niggaz I'd be back in a minute and pushed the rock
On the block where I go hard
I know cats like Flood who work with soft but the base is so hard
Grabbed the ratchet, smacked the bastard
Coke in the plastic, dope transport in caskets
And a pinky ring the size of a Easter basket
I hit the block like, fuck that, no one could match it
Peal out, in a red Ferrari
Red tint, stay bent off the ganja from the Bedjumari
Y'all niggaz ain't hardly live
And my squad G'd up, man, we hardly died
Post up, bebe kid, we multiply
And sharpshooter who shoot rappers, and hope they die
Beez Mode, Doc Ama and car bomber
Arm-a-Leg-a-Leg-Arm-a, slash, dot, period, comma

[Hook 2X: Carlton Fisk]
Rep when you say you reppin'
Step when you say you steppin'
No Hummer stylin', blaze ya weapon
Another street soldier falls
Another case of when keep it real go wrong

[Dr. Ama]
All you see bloodshed, bang out, Crips blue, Bloods red
The bomb bakes a little Kwame into a dusthead
Some nigga said Buck's dead, leakin' lava from his crushed head
Gotta touch bread and push the plush shit
Was the last thing we discussed-ed
Ratchet in hand, plan to scrape somethin', yard is really dusted
Buck him, be easy, my nigga, fuck this
What? Son, you too flustered, don't trust this
The scene, you seem too slow to blow his musket
Lust the green, somethin' mean, kid had a sweet tooth
You could eat in the streets, don't let the streets eat you
Store only meat blue, homey flew from the cells too
Felt juks, stressed out with that fell look
His mom was screamin', "Buck, Buck, baby wake up"
Tears flow, watch the heart break up
All he really wanted was to get his cake up
Instead, all he got was hot lead, tore his face up

[Interlude: Carlton Fisk]
Aiyo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, y'all mothafuckas is snitchin' on blocks where niggaz died
And repped for, niggaz bled for that bullshit y'all niggaz is doin'
And that's fucked up, y'all niggaz know what the fuck is goin' on
Man, I'm tellin' y'all niggaz, hold ya fuckin' mouth closed
Man, these niggaz ain't supposed to die for nothin', yo...

[Carlton Fisk]
This for the hard, street level felons that hustle with they rods
Bitch get out of line and you tustle with ya broad
Get inside her mind and have her on the job
This for Riker's Island yard, this for the scarred
Women that be bitten with they nigga when they nigga get trapped behind bars
This for ya moms
Always in ya package with ya frontin' ass up, know I'm tryin' to play Don
Want to talk cash? I could read ya palm
If you wanna go to war, baby, squeeze ya arms
Verrazano deal with various types
Gimme like sixteen minutes, I could get you a bomb
And my life more than sixteen bars
From these sixteen bars, enough CREAM, get sixteen cars
My team got sixteen stars
So it's sixteen beans on ya head from sixteen rods

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Y'all niggaz know what time it is, man
I done came here with some mothafuckin' friends of mine
You understand me? Ya dig?
This is yessa yessa, my lord
Y'all holla at the peoples, man
For real, man, y'all holla at ya mans, man
This is what we do, man
This my life, man
Y'all niggaz don't know shit about me, man
But we gon' roll up and roll out
Do what the fuck we do, like we been doin' it
KnowImean? The whole Staten Island, man
Act like y'all know what we do, man
Let's put this shit together, man
Hop on or hop off, man
That's what it is, man
House Gang, 7 O.D.
I wanna thank y'all for comin' out tonight
And that's how we gon' roll that shit
Let's go baby...
Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou...</pre>
