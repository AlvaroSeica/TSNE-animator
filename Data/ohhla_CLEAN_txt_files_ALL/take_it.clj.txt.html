[Intro: Joe] (LL Cool J)
Ooooooooooohhhhhhh!!! (I'm a do the whole joint again)
Whoa oh ooooooooohhhhh!!! Whoa! Oooh!

[Verse One: LL Cool J] (Joe)
Lookin at my rollie it's about that time
For me to paint pictures on the walls in your mind
These quality masterpieces are hard to find
That's why from six to nine they stand on line
I feel like a underdog comin from behind
Pressure bust pipes relax you'll be fine
LL got the remedy intervention divine
I gave you the gift of missin me it's all by design
(I hear you talkin) It's a privilege to be mine
(For your lovin) I put it all on the line
All night you could come all day you could shop 
Let the bells jingaling and let the champagne pop

[Chorus: Joe] (LL Cool J)
Oh! Twelve to six, six to nine, 'round the clock don't run and hide
Can you take it? (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it)    
Let me love you babe, I won't make you wait
Can you take it? (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it Take it

[Verse Two: LL Cool J] (Joe)
Ignore the clock it's time to make the bed rock
It's hood we don't even hear the sirens and gunshots
I'm strokin your floatin and what not
Skin sticky but no hickies, better not
The tensions high I'm outside the box
My pin on the balloon without makin it pop
It feels like new year's but two balls drop
Almost at the top now you beggin me to stop
(I hear you talkin) It's a privilege to be mine
(For your lovin) I put it all on the line
All night you could come all day you could shop 
Let the bells jingaling and let the champagne pop

[Chorus: Joe] (LL Cool J)
Oh! Twelve to six, six to nine, 'round the clock don't run and hide
Can you take it? (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it)    
Let me love you babe, I won't make you wait
Can you take it? (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it Take it

[Bridge: LL Cool J]
Take a ride look down in my eyes
Flooded like my chain I could drown in your thighs
A little bit of pain brings joy to your life
Lay your head back relax and get right
Souls unified beneath the moonlight 
It's only you and I no other invites
I wanna see you naked, watch you take it
I'm elated, and so are you

[Chorus: Joe] (LL Cool J)
Oh! Twelve to six, six to nine, 'round the clock don't run and hide
Can you take it? (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it)    
Let me love you babe, I won't make you wait
Can you take it? (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it Take it
Twelve to six, six to nine, 'round the clock don't run and hide
Can you take it? (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it)    
Let me love you babe, I won't make you wait
Can you take it? (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it (Take it) Take it Take it

[Outro: LL Cool J]
Sometimes I gotta give you the gift of missin me, for you to appreciate what you got ya nah mean</pre>
