Aye now I could say my name but (say my name but)
Your bitch already knows it (knows it)
Got no problem spending paper (paper)
I got it so I blow it (I blow it)

Shawty what's your name put your number in my sidekick
Caught the nut in spaceship your fuckin with a pilot
Say she wanna ride well I can give her mile-age
Plus I live the star life won't you come an try it
Say I'm wrong I can do that pussy right
And when another time zone I can b there by tonite
Beat it I can like cuple bottles of patron
Do sum thing tonite no problem cus we grown
So I'm a pass go, an if you feel the way I feel
then let's quit talkin bout it shawty let's go
Do you like it fast slow, say she gotta need for speed
if I can drive then I'm a needa a crash course oh
So I threw it on her shawty threw it back at her freaky shit
You do it to me I'm a do it back
an them statches gon ruin the tattos that's on my back
So I don't know what with it but you know how to act
looks like I'm here with you al night long
An I wanna see it so I beat her with the lights on
I ain't no tease I wanna b your main attraction
Roll camara please I think it's time for sum action, sum action
it's not like I been with you all night long
And I wanna see it so I beat her with the lights on
I ain't no tease I wanna be your main attraction
Roll camera please I think it's time for sum action, sum action whoa
Then we can play it right back, I hope your kitty cat mean so I can bite back
Take off them jeans drink this night cap say men are from mars
You can be my venus fly track, damn your grip tight, let me put it on you slow
And let me speed up at the light
girl your body look to right to even try to put a price on
So I jus leave the lights on
I have you tryin different kinds of shit when you make it up in my room
I told you girl that I'm a hit it in high definition
keep your lines in your head but in the bed we get unscripted
Aye... beat while they home I don't take em out to dinna, I need shawty on my camera aye
Looks like we been here all night long and I wanna see her so I beat her with the lights on
And I ain't no tease I wanna be your main attraction
Roll camera please I think it's time for sum action, sum action
Looks like we been here all night long
an I wanna see her so I beat her with the lights on
And ain't no tease I wanna be your main attraction
Roll camera please I think it's time for sum action, sum action
