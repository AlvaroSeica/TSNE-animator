[Althea]
Ohhh yeahh, yeah, ooh
Yeahhh-yeah-yeah, ohhh, ohhhh

[Verse One: Foxy Brown]
From the cradle til' now, still Fox, just a little more mature
Seen it with my bare eyes, did it all before
Been through hell on earth
Playin' out my role I was given since birth, receptin' it well
Go hard at them critics, they expect me to fail
Work hard for my fans, they expect me to sell
They suspect I'm livin' well
But they don't know the pain I feel
Five minutes away from gettin' killed, it's ill
My moms always hug me when I'm leavin'
I wake up cryin' because death bugs me when I'm sleepin'
Jam Master died, it's like I ain't done grievin'
Big and Pac gone and look we still beefin'
And son even, we at odds in these days
where niggas die over cars and they chains
I thank God that I'm saved and I'mma hold it down in this game
Now, from the cradle to the grave

[Chorus: Althea]
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way

[Verse Two: Foxy Brown]
From the cradle til now, I been through it all y'all
Y'all don't know half the things, I been through it dawg
Pain and sufferation, I been through it all
My heart's still cold, I been through the storm
Confused all these years, shit, we grew all these years 
I remember me and you on the stairs
Talkin' bout what we gonna do when we're big
Money came into play and best friends went they way, shit
I wish it never had to go that way, uh
The price of fame can cost a whole friendship
Yeah we got dollars, but it's senseless
So I pray to God for forgiveness and ask him to carry me through
all the stress and the drama in this business
I bare witness, I Fox, and keep going strong until my heart stop
and keep flowing strong with a ?rap pon coc?, c'mon

[Chorus: Althea]
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way

[Althea]
As a little girl I wish I knew that I
would be goin' through the drama that's in my life
All the sufferin', everywhere I been
How I get myself in all this bullshit I'm in

[Verse Three: Foxy Brown]
From now til' the grave, I look back at my life
smile and say "wow" in amazement
All these roadblocks, wonder how did I make it
wonder how I 'came famous, I'm impressed with me
It's like rumours been obsessed with me
but the truth never told, it was left with me
And what's left for me, is to extend my hand
If they don't reach then I'll let them be
I got to live my life right
but I wouldn't change how I lived my like 
if I could live my life twice
Y'all don't understand what Inga's life's like
A black stressed, I turned my back to the world
and now I'm back to the world, this black girl's blessed
Yeah, my fans helped me through it
I was destined to blaze from the cradle to the grave
Thank God my fam helped me through it (c'mon)

[Chorus: Althea]
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way</pre>
