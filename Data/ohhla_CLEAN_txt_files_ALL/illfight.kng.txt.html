DJ Bull, Dirty 3rd Records, Freestyle Kingz
FK2K3, all freestyles, this how it go down
Dirty South style, right now I'ma unleash the Kingz
What's up

[Hook]
Put your hands up, when D3 come through
When we standing face to face, what you gonna do
Put your hands up, when D3 come through
If you make one move, then your ass is screwed
You wanna box I'll swang, say bitch I'll fight
If you miss with the left, then catch him with the right
You wanna box I'll swang, say bitch I'll fight
Break him down like a fraction, if he got a lot of hype

[Big Ake]
See you might see me with a gun in my hand, dangerous man
Get pissed off start tripping, and go bust in your clan
What in the fuck these niggaz thinking, when they mention my name
Did I mention I will swang, and fuck up your brain
When I rap I spit flames, so the mic gon burn
Knock a nigga ass out, then tell your partna you turned
Dunk a hater in gasoline, just like a shirt
Fire him up like a blunt, then smoke one when he burn
It's my term best believe, I gotta live my dream
Get the head up at all time, I got high self esteem
And nan nigga can take it, like my nuts is here
I spit shit for your brain, so listen good with your ear
And I ain't playing with this track, I know you niggaz can tell
I'm like a nerd there go the class, I just can't fail
Been about having money, and that shit that bling
My rhymes addictive, they leave fans begging like fiends

[Hook]

[Lil Sho]
Fuck Uncle Sam, I don't pay no taxes
Beat his ass so bad, his funeral was closed casket
If Ake box then I box, if I box then Redd box
With all these hard hitters, somebody ass gon get dropped
Don't hate on my click, cause we all ball
Get your ass racked up, like a set of pool balls
Leave you hanging in a tree, thirty feet above the ground
The paramedics gon need a ladder, just to get your ass down
Fucking with me, get your ass beat up
Throw a nigga in the trunk, and crank the beat up
If I pull out my guns, I'll make you put the heat up
Put a hole in your ass, your partna's scared to speak up
Knock you one more time, your heart rate speed up
The newspaper where you at, now people read up
Now my work is done, time to fire the weed up
Everybody know the youngster, Lil Sho's g'd up

[Hook]

[Sir Coop]
It's Sir Coop-a, nigga I'm a thug recruiter
Go scarring full of niggaz, that ain't scared to shoot you
Go on strike if you like, cause this snake gon rattle
If it's beef in the Tex, it better be cattle
Trying to stop my blow, if your nuts hang low
Cause real thugs get down on the flo', and I'm a pro
Big Wide on the drama, the peace I kept
But niggaz steady talking shit, trying to boost they rep
DSR holla back, if you feel this shit
I got a plan for them haters, so let's make this hit
I'm a G, bitch you don't believe gonna see
Not a thing for the 3, to have you got in these streets
Ain't no need to run son, cause you gon get chased
Pull my pistol like Marcus, I'll color your face
Now who the fuck it's gon be, partna you or me
My niggaz answer that shit (C double O-P)

[Hook]

[Chalie]
I'm not a warrior, but bitch I'll fight
Your sight may seem bright, until I bite your light
The rap game to run from, from your stepson
Get endorsement checks, before I wreck or step on
The crack the weapon, I pack in a black coat
Leaving you caught up like a nut, in the back of a fat coat
That's a bad joke, but no disrespect
No discrimination for people, play me in they deck
I came to wreck this crew, boys done pissed me
Off, for thinking I'm some kind of fucking sissy
I suggest you tell, your mama don't miss the
News, leaving your child abused, burnt and crispy
Beep beep between those, that beef with me
OG CB, you hoes won't see me
One on one, I'll just love to squab you son
Or should I say honey bun, you broads is done

[Hook]
