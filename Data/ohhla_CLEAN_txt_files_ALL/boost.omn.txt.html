[Chorus]
here we go again
I been travellin'
here we go again
I been travellin'

duffle bag
draggin pants
saggin'
never gave a fuck
bad manners
hustling the locals
trying to get a buck
trying to get enough to eat
this drink might fill me up
saving up for a week a chee
like indica
I'm on the map
if you on the map I'mma visit ya
bring a cd to bump with my signature
major city style
puttin' down the godzilla for ya
I been around
in and outta town trivia
let me get your number and your address vivica
if you's a freak I'mma straight try to live wit-cha
I'll be back
if the ass if fat I'll remember ya
the dl's how we bail
just sell what I send to ya

[Chorus w/ response]
here we go again
here we go again here we go again come on come on
I been travellin'
I been travellin' I been travellin' from here to there and back
here we go again
here we go again here we go again come on come on come on
I been travellin' I been travellin'

sup boy it's the hostel
smoking bud with the rastas
opening up tomorrow
it's the same shit again
sleep on studio couches over fat girls houses
I stay till she kicks me out
man the game never ends
bad news
fast food
every city I pass through
I'm always drunk and out of work
this album was past due
ask who
for what the fuck I do what I have to
international
coach class
drinks by the glass-full
stepping off the airline
showing off my natural
just left your country
they shoulda made a statue
shimmy past customs
stashing shit in the bathroom
shastas ain't fucking with these coca cola classics

[Chorus w/ response]

ever since a youngster I was never known to sit still
in my course of life I make a pit stop to switch reels
this shit's real
bigger than your inner city day to day
'cause nowadays ain't always paid
ain't enough to pave the way
ya'll may think I'm like an action hero trying to save the way
far away from home hoping all my problems fade away
drifting through shades of gray
living for the moment
I be walking down the street not even knowing where I'm going
I'm a dog in the rain
I broke the chain on the fence
hopped the gate
and I've never been the same ever since
I'm a dog in the rain
I broke the chain on the fence
hopped the gate
and I've never been the same ever since
come on

[Chorus w/ response]</pre>
