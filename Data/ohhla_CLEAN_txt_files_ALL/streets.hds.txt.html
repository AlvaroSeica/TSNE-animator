R.I.P. (R.I.P.), DJ Screw (DJ Screw)
We never gon forget you baby, love you my nigga
That's for real, huh, G-O-V (G-O-V)
S.U.C. (S.U.C.), G-O-V (S.U.C.)

[Mr. 3-2]
One day you here, the next day you gone
Never I thought I'd say, R.I.P. to Screw in a song
But he gone I can't believe it, now he in a better place
And all I vision now, was a smile on his face
Saying don't worry, everybody move ahead
It's Screwed Up Click, till the day that I'm dead
Go FED if I have to, put it all on the line
G-O-V, S.U.C., it go down all around
Coast to coast, people slowing it up
Saying man hold up, with codeine in they cup
I hustle up and go get it, mash for the cash
The fruit of all evil, got us all living fast

[Chorus - 2x]
These streets these streets, we living in
Will I see death or the Penn
Everybody want ends, and a brand new Benz
fake foes and friends, in these streets of sin

[Mr. 3-2]
See this more I'm cold, and this street game I played
All up in your face, bout to put work in for the case
You better watch what you say, bout S.U.C
Cause you don't wanna cross that line, and end your L-I-F-E
G-O-V, representing the almighty dollar
Fake niggaz speak like hoes, but real niggaz follow
Holla holla, if you ain't talking bout nothing
Bitch you better get out my face, move around and stack something
You stunting big talking, but ain't did jack
I put the word in, and somebody gon bring your hat
The Boss Man, Mr. 3-2
And it's all dedicated, to my nigga DJ Screw

[Chorus - 2x]

[Mr. 3-2]
2001 these streets is crazy, no doubt
Coming up and pulling moves, transactions at the spot
I had to get it however, bills gotta be paid
Now I'm thoed living laid, Gucci locs with long braids
Playa made independent, hundred thousand out the do'
Went up and X'd out, crawling down slow
With your hoe going live, on the whole click
I'm a pimp not a trick, it's in my blood I must admit
We on hit in the South, Gulf Coast number three
Southside of the tree, H to the C
Pulling all-nighters, reminiscing bout the people who gone
Cause they never coming back, so we gotta hold on

[Chorus - 2x]

(*talking*)
These streets, that we live in huh
Rest in peace DJ Screw, rest in peace Fat Pat
Rest in peace Lil' Gator, rest in peace Pat Lemons
It go on and on, Mafio, Big Rue, love y'all baby</pre>
