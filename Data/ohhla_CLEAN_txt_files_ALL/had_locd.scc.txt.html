Yo Prod hit the muthafuckin hood and get a clown on G
A nine a clip the Uzi for the punks that wanna beef

It's the 1990's Havikk sent to poppin trunks 
hit the damned parks all the niggas gettin loc
smokin that endo brawlin on a coke
Crips huggin Bloods Bloods huggin on a Crip G
Niggas got the AK stash for the PD ohh

or either wake ya drop it 
SCC's in the house to the ho's you

get your ass beat in the street muthafucka
lighter than the lightest muthafucka cause I´m ruthless
come into my hood and your ass is leavin toothless

chorus:
had to be loc'd cause I claim south central
 *wassup punk this is south central*

strollin thru the hood with the quickness
gunshots rippin niggas in the hood still trippin
gotta pack a Gat yo when I'm steppin with the fellas
cause 1 outta 10 in a crowd will get jealous
and wanna get his smoke on cause he packs chrome
but tryna flex and catch a .9 to your damned dome
so fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck the bullshit
I stay Geed and my attitude is kill bitch
I roll a 4 drop low on a twisters
a .380 in my labb for the jackers
south to the muthafuckin central call a jail pro
a young black muthafucka is on the way from home
locked down ain't shit G
I'm in and outta jail like a man and not a pussy
give me 5 years yo I'm outta in 2
back on the streets slangin yea it's nuttin new

 *wassup punk this is south central*
