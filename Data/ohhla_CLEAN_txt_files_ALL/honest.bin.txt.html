Artist: Binary Star
Album:  Waterworld
Song:   Honest Expression
Typed by: Senortre@aol.com

Intro:
Ultimately, martial art means honestly expressing yourself...
it is easy for me to put on a show and be cocky, 
or I could show you some really fancy movement...
But to express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself, 
and to express myslef honestly...
Now that, my friend is very hard to do.

Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives
And for that live moment we thrive
Awakenings, as we make the dead come alive
Rise and walk my son
Come into the light
Inside the dark we illuminate mics
Give knowledge to mediocre
The will to neanderthal
Filter to the the small
Digital to analog
We steady advancin'
Rhyme enhancin'
Civil minds can't keep up with this

Senim Silla:
Dig - I'ma put it on the table
I ain't a thug nigga and playa, I ain't playful
I'm just Senim Silla, man without label
Standin' on my own to you tryin' to stay stable
Speakin' what I know to only what I'm able
I ain't the kinda guy who carry on for dough
The material cat who walk around for show
I'm just your everyday, merry way joe on the go
While others go with the flow
I ain't never been the one to follow trend, I do my own bit
Can't keep up with the joneses, I'm on my own shit
I don't care what you drink
What you stress, how you dress, or where you got the link
I ain't impressed
These lames run around like mice in a maze
Tryin' to get up on cheese, its just a rat race
Wanna change times' schemes to make man worship things
Over the supreme being, or stop, fill up?
Should I join the hypocrites?
Or side with the suckas by choice
It makes no difference that y'all product of environment
It's just coincidence
The world's a violent place baby, there ain't no more innocence
Or civil men or penatence, just
Ignorance cast on the right from wrong 
They mimic shit they see on TV or hear in a song
What that tell you they on?
A sucka act up every minute
The righteous live on but the the niggas are infinite

I ain't hardcore, I don't pack a 9 millimeter
Most of y'all gangster rappers ain't hardcore neither
Whoever get mad then I'm talkin 'bout you
Claim you fear no man but never walk without crew
Where I'm from, your reputation don't mean jack
So what you pack gats and you sell fiend's crack
You ain't big time, my man
You ain't no different from the next cat in my neigberhood who did time
Rhyme after rhyme it's the same topic
What make you think you hardcore cuz you was raised in the projects
Broke ass finally got a hundred in your pocket
Now you on the mic spittin' money's no object
What you say is bullcrap
If you wasn't with your crew and wasn't drunk off the brew
Would you still pull gats?
You need to stop frontin'
Or you're headed for self destruction
Yeah, today's topic is self-destruction
I ain't talkin 'bout the KRS-One discussion
I'm talkin 'bout the one too many ignorant suckas
Lyin' on the mic to my sistas and brothas
Everytime you listen to the radio, all you hear is nonsense
They never play the bomb shit
Everything that glitters ain't gold
And every gold record don't glitter that's for damn sure

(scratching break)

(discussion)

?:
How many cats you know speak the illegit rhyme after rhyme diligent?
85 percent represent ignorant
Either you innocent or guilty
Some of my favorite emcees fell off
It damn near killed me
Lookin' at the kids that was true hip-hop
Nowadays them cats don't even do hip-hop
Rap got 'em brainwashed with cats that don't last
And five minutes of fame 
That's when it's a shame
Seein real emcees tryin' to imitate rappers
If you ask me they goin' out ass backwards
Tradin' in respect to push a fat Lex
Puff rhymin' on the remix, what's next?
It hurts so bad I wanna smack 'em
My favorite crew members break up turn around and join wack ones
This is dedicated to you hip-hop hypocrites
Drivin wack songs like you don't give a shit
I ain't got nothin' against nobody tryin' to make a decent living
It ain't the money that's the issue
Only if that's the reason why these cats are makin' decent music
That's when I got beef with you
And I'ma break it you like never
Go ahead, call me player hater if it make you feel better
Try to jump my crew if you cats feel foggy
You need to wake up and smell the damn coffee</pre>
