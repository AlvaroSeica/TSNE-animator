[Hook - 2x]
Magnificent 3rd (3rd), Magno coast (coast)
What I grip (grip), nigga that 4-4
What I flip (flip), swangas and 4's (4's)
Magno, Magno, Magno, Magno

[Magno]
Down South we keep a clip in the Regal, as if it was legal
Niggas on the block, flipping them eagles
That's a very big verb, very quick with slick verbs
I'm down South, so you know I sip syrup
And pop handle bars, dodge cops with scanner cards
I was 13, popping holes on my handle bars
That's my peddle bike, before I got my cheddar right
This is 3rd Coast, let me show you what my ghetto like
North Houston, Greenspoint to be exact
We double hustle, sell c.d.'s with a ki attached
See me in the cleanest Lac, G.P. where you'll see me at
Koopa told you, it don't take a true genius act
That you don't know my green is stacked, haters I love those
They make me click, and flick buggars out the snub nose
Oops now the club closed, time to plug hoes
We roll spinners down South, look at my Dubs go

[Hook - 2x]

[Magno]
Blow on trees hoes on knees, fo's or threes
The H roll swangas, D-Town roll G's

(*scratching*)
H roll swangas, D-Town roll G's
H roll swangas, D-Town roll G's

It's Magno I bust flows at ease I gotta keep that flow blazing
Like a unemployed doctor, I got no patients
Gotta keep that money coming, so why you dummies fronting
Like I ain't fucking your bitch, and got your honey cumming
Getting brain frequent
I don't handcuff em, I don't know where your freak went

(*scratching*)
I don't handcuff em, I don't know where your freak went
I don't handcuff em, I don't know where your freak went

I get Cali, with my L.A. peers
I'm like the Denver Broncos, in they Elway years
Mean whips screens lit, like some L.A. gears
You click and chill with the mean shit, I can tell they queers
New glock uzi new hot floozy, that'll give brain
Without spilling a stain on my new Bykuzie
Yes that's a Celtics throwback, you can tell we wrote that
That's them haters whining, mad cause I'm getting mo' cash
