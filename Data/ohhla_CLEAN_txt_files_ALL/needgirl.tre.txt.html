Shawty where you at?
Shawty where you at?
Shawty where you at?
Yea, yea

It gets lonely in this business, need a homey
Who tha realest
Someone who wants to find out all that I have to give
Who can bring me what is missin', when I talk she wanna listen
Sittin' patient steady waitin', for the day when I can face it

The one that can love me for, who I am and so much more (is it you?)
You ma Bonnie (say that I) I found the one
I ain't gonna rest till I know for sure, sure

Baby please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl (need a girl)
So come on pretty lady won't you holla back, I need a girl
(I'm a tell you what I need)
I need a girl that's goin' be my baby, so if you love me say "I'm your baby"
So fine I go "that's my baby", so if you need me say "your my baby"

I'm a good man, who ain't got a lot to ask
just lookin' for somethin' I can build on
I'm a young man, with a whole lotta cash
just lookin' for a lady I can spend on
So all the young ladies in every little city
when I come to your town, let me know that you down
Sittin' patient steady waitin', for the day when I can face it

The one that can love me for, who I am and so much more (is it you?)
You ma Bonnie (say that I) I found the one
I ain't gonna rest till I know for sure, sure oohhh

Baby please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl (girl)
So come on pretty lady won't you holla back, I need a girl
(I'm a tell you what I need)
I need a girl that's goin' be my baby, so if you love me say "I'm your baby"
So fine I go "that's my baby", so if you need me say "your my baby"

You could, be my everything
Oh you mean so much to me and I don't even know your name
(But I know that...) that I'm your man (man), and you are my girl (girl)
and if I eva meet ya I'm a give ya the world (oh)

Baby please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl (girl)
