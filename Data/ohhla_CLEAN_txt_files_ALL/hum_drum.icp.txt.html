she surprises me, sometimes she hums on my balls
and I can see the world right through her bedroom walls
she has a jaw like a pelican's beak is deep
humming me right to sleep, my favortie freak
I can rearrange the patterns of the stars in the sky
I can fly with the seagulls on the beach with the tide
cause she can blow me there, I swear, right through the air
if I ain't really there, my balls do not care, my balls

come on put it on me bitch
hit me with the humdrum boogie
that thing, oh goodie
come on put it on me bitch
right now, right now boogie
that thing, my balls
come on put it on me bitch
hit me with the humdrum boogie
that thing, oh goodie
come on put it on me bitch

I see my life flash before me
I hear all my favortie song at one time
(when she blow me) right before I actually go blind
I'm running back and forth though the door of (in and out of) my mind
(when she blow me) my favortie freak is so fine
to have her hum in performance, the show is enormous
only two fans in attendance, these two in my pants
(my balls) she's my favortie, she's got my standing applause
humming me into harmony, right through my balls

come on put it on me bitch
hit me with the humdrum boggie
that thing, oh goodie
come on put it on me bitch
right now, right now
boogie, that thing, my balls
come on put it on me bitch
right now, right now
boogie, that thing, my balls

undo my belt, put down my drawers
kiss my dick and hum my balls
undo my belt, put down my drawers
kiss my dick and hum my balls

and she can blow me there, I swear, right through the air
if I ain't really there, my balls do not care, my balls

come on put it on me bitch
hit me with the humdrum boogie
that thing, oh goodie
come on put it on me bitch
right now, right now
boogie, that thing, my balls
come on put it on me bitch
hit me with the humdrum boogie
that thing, oh goodie
come on put it on me bitch
right now, right now
boogie, that thing, my balls</pre>
