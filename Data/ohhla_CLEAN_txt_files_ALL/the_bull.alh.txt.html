[Darkim Be Allah]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
The bullfighter, rhyme writer
King of fame, Donnie Banks, rings in ya area
Speakin all languages, chance to all challengers
My life hangs in the balances
I hate war, but I've been there before
Stay raw to the core, these motherfuckers think I'm playin?
Amuse you? Fuck with me, your family's gonna lose you
Roll your dice, this game is only one life
Live by the sword and die by the gun or knife
I fight with my shadow stay hype
for the battle, thick greys I blaze
In the saddle, dark bullfighter
These niggas was sparked, like a lighter
The bullfighter, rhyme writer</pre>
