[Mavado]
Party 'til di sun comes up 'til di sun goes down, tun up di sound
Bad girls all around, oh so round like a english pound
Like a dog mi a roam, like a dog to a bone, nuh long talk like nuh phone
Like a benz wid chrome mi haffi mek har my own; so girl

[Chorus: Mavado] 
I want yuh give it all to me, give it all to me
Gyal di wey yuh a wine gyal yuh know seh yuh groovy, yuh groovy
Dem a pree dem a stare dem a watch like movie, movie
Yuh a tell mi yuh bad now a time fi yuh prove it, so prove it 

[Nicki Minaj]
Uh, aiyyo Mavado, tell 'em lick a shot, hallow
{*gunshot*} Tell 'em seh we straight, arrow
Tell 'em di flow tight, narrow
Everyting we did a start dem borrow
C-C-C-C-Cruised up, link my dudes up
The coupe black and blue yep it's bruised up (What!)
I'm like, who's up? (Uh Huh!) Girls it's used up (OK!)
If these niggas my sons I tied my tubes up
Tell 'em again bad gyal, toasters oozed up (Come on!)
I hit up instagram, post some nudes up (UH!)
Bun fyah, rub it, pop a wheelie
Caribbean girls run it, ask RiRi

[Chorus]

[Mavado]
Hotness check, sexiness check
Walk past man a bruk dem neck
Style, check, intelligence check
Pandemonium when yuh step
So just send mi a text, what's that message mi nuh use BBM
Gyal yuh hotta than dem, gyal yuh a problem; so mi seh girl

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
I'll handle you, let me dance for you
I might be thinkin bout leavin my mans for you
I'll handle you, let me dance for you
I might be thinkin bout leavin my mans for you
Yeah!

[Outro: Mavado] + (Nicki Minaj)
Like a dog mi a roam, like a dog to a bone
Nuh long talk like nuh phone
Like a benz wid chrome mi haffi mek har my own
(Make me your own baby, make me your own baby)
(I'm here, I'm here - I'm heeeerrrreeeeee!!)
So girl (pretty girl inna di place!) I want yuh give it all to me (Mavado!)
Di wey yuh a wine gyal yuh know seh yuh groovy, yuh groovy (YAH!!!)</pre>
