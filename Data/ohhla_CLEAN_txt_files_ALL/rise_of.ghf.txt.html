Song:   Rise of the Ghostface Killah
Typed by: Cno Evil

[RZA]
The DeLuca's pressed Toney's remains into 12 vinyl records
One for each member of the family
But little did they know, he would return

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, Medusa's stare, my guns bust in silence
I'm a black vigilante Killah, pro violence
It's the rebirth, born again, rise through the vinyl spin
They took out Starks, but the light shines within
It's the almighty rise of the murderous Ghostface
Bodies dropped in aisles, left a cold case
Colombian neckties from a black Gambino
Bodies get dumped in a black El Camino
It's Reno, gangsta wars, money, power, respect
Revenge is felt, like a heat from a tech
Tommy guns are irrelevant, I'm bulletproof now
I can fly through the air and duck, chicka-pow
Black superhero, crime boss arch nemesis
Good vs. evil since the first Book of Genesis
Battle til the end, that's the way of the thriller
And Starks is reborn as the Ghostface Killah
Yeah, yeah, no one could get iller

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Murders, bodies chopped into ziplocks
Kill or be killed on these cobblestone street blocks
Crime boss, I caught war on the DeLuca's
Watch my eyes turn red, I got a squad full of shooters
Murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
When the gats starts to pull, I put the spark to your grill

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, late night, stuck in the limo, hog tied
To cap it all off, beheaded the driver
Left the bitch in the back with no tongue as a survivor
Raw dog, spit in her mouth
Disappear in the swarm of Killa Beez, crippler from the knees
Take they legs out, nigga, you know the steez
I'm a night hawk, evil eyed power of mind control
Faster then the speed of light, they catch a big hole
Ruthless, six bodies hung in the meat row
The butcher shop, I call it the body shop
Start from the bottom, killing all the way to the top
Carve my name in your skin, pull the stocking mask over your face
For recognition, no time for remitting
Attack til there's no one left in the position
The return of the worst case scenario
Ugh, Ghostface attacks on land and not aerial

[samples]
Ghost, Ghostface - Ol' Dirty Bastard
Ghostface - Ghostface Killah
Ghostface - Ol' Dirty Bastard
And Starks is reborn, reborn as the - Ghostface Killah
Ghostface Killah - Ol' Dirty Bastard

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Watch the body count rise when the Face gets real </pre>
