Yo
Let's take it back to the Maritimes Man
You can't take yourself so serious
Do that thing you guys were doing

Fill your cup up and chug
Roll a joint up and get fucked
Ready for a kitchen party
Welcome to the Maritimes

I'm from the East Coast of Canada, home of the bagpipe
Known for the fiddle players, beer and out keg price
Known for Alexander Keiths and the donair
Home of the Mooseheads but I don't really go there
We pay a buck for a litre of gas and
Smokes cost $10 a pack and
We always mix our tobacco with weed
It's just the way it's always been shit is natural to me
So let me tackle the beat and unravel the scene
Let you people know what you never travel to see
We got battle MC's, we got storytellers
And we got awful MC's and corny motherfuckers
We got everything you wanna hear
Conscious to Back pack, Commercial to Gangsta
R&amp;B to Abstract, grunge to Rock, Classical to Country
So many artist workin' but no one making money
Welcome to the East Coast, home of the innocence
Still Piegon Hole, as a farm or a fisher man

No major league teams, no baseball or hockey
No urban radio Just country and pop-beats
I'm trying to shake these stereo types
So give me space please, let me air out my life
I don't even eat fish, shit I never tried lobster
Cant play the fiddle, and never was a logger
But I swam in clean lakes, and enjoyed cool breezes
But Halifax Harbours like swimming in diseases
We only known for Anne &amp; Green Gable
Coal mines to Blue Nose and P.E.I. Potatoes
The Maritimes, its better then that
We livin' in the nether times so dead it with that
We got universal soul and buck 65 an
The whole UCG and of course Classified
We got back burner, goo night, alpha flight, Lock Down
Mic Boyd, first word, tro biz and hell town
And a million other artist, trying to get there flow heard
And Let you know that we still workin' on these outskirts
We trying to blow like Halifax Explosion
Or maybe Anne Marie I know she's Nova Scotian
A Hurricane Juan blowin from the ocean
Either way it goes I'm still reppin for my coast man

That's how we do it down here
Least that's how you think we do it down here
We all pile in the kitchen 
Do it like this

Fill your cup up and chug
Roll a joint up and get fucked
Ready for a kitchen party
Welcome to the Maritimes
