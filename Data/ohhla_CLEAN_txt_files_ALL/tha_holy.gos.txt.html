[Intro: Mr. Solo]
Yeah, My homeboy's back
Ready to break you off again like pat pat like that
You know what I'm sayin?
Ain't no playin, We prayin, That's how we sprayin
Wit them 66 books, Devil look
[Ha ha ha ha] Here we come
You can't get me son
Um, The one, Mr. DJ Dove
Back, Givin big love, Showin you what's really goin on
Ha, Comin too strong
Yo, Dove, Serve em!

[DJ Dove]
You better run for ya life Devil, Yeah I'm talkin to you clown
Cause when I catch you on the streets I finna break you down
But you heard about the anointing and you won't come near it
So, Like my God, I'ma crush you by his spirit
Punk busta, You're nothin but a mark
My fist to yo chin'll put yo lights out dark
And then i'll still proceed to bank on ya
Or pull the sword of the spirit i'll proceed to drop a shank on ya
Cause that's what my people is famous fo
I ain't that ese you wanna have knockin at yo do
Hopin I got yo devil butts at home
Cause if ya open up, It's 66 rounds to the dome
It's on, I'm skinnin ya to the bone
I'm takin you down and comin to get you like Stallone
Straight packin and jackin and crackin ya skull just like a hollow point
You demonic dummy, This is a gospel joint
So heck naw, Don't make me no deal
For God, I stand real just like my homeboy Chille Chill
And it ain't no use in layin low
Cause sniffin you out'll be my road dog Mr. Solo
And if you wanna learn the real meaning of the word thang
Watch 'em pray and fast and drop those spiritual thangs
I gaurantee you'll drop dead
Cause Tik Tokk'll drop click clock all upside yo forehead
It's like I said punk we gangstas
No I haven't been down forever
But better late than never
Punk, See I never consider myself a cholo
Now I'm claimin Jesus Christ, That's me barrio
I'm comin strong, Think I'm crazy? Man, I'm gizzone
The flesh is dead, Holy Spirit runnin through my head
Pero a tan tis gana dsamo vasa corret
Es sportu vato loco steelo Christo loce vaso ved
DJ Dove, The costa rican that you'll remember forever
As the holy terra

[Outro: Mr. Solo]
Ha ha ha ha, My dog in the house
I told you, Ha ha, Yeah, Holy terra
Comin at ya, Leavin ya stiff just like a statya
You know what I'm sizzaying?
Finna blow up in the nine-fizzo
Comin through the do', We was on our way in the nine-trizzae
Like Tik Tokk said, You know
Pimp them keys, Ese

Scratches

''The Holy Ghost in his soul''

[Mr. Solo]
Yeah, Cuttin wit the Holy Ghost in his soul, Baby

Another bomb from the holy terra productions
