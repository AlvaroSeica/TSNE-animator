[John Legend]
Ooooh, oh oh yeah
Yeah yeah
Time is getting harder and harder
More and more each day, yeah
Still I am determined
That I'm never gonna change my way
Thinkin 'bout love the way it should be
You better open your eyes, and you will see
About love, the way it should be
You gotta make up your minds and you'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity

[John Legend - repeat 2X]
What happened to the love that they are all talking about?
It's nothing but useless words coming from out of their mouths
Talking 'bout love the way it should be
We gotta open our eyes and we will see
About love the way it should be
We gotta make up our minds and we'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity

[John Legend]
Yeah listen people listen
(You got the notion, I hope so)
Listen what I'm saying to you
(You got the notion, I hope so)
A little bit of justice, and peace
(You got the notion, I hope so)
But bring a little love, for everyone
(You got the notion, I hope so)
Said you got the notion, you got the notion
(You got the notion, I hope so)
So get in the motion, get in the motion
(You got the notion, I hope so)
You got the notion
(You got the notion, I hope so)
So get in the motion
(You got the notion, I hope so)
Oh ohhhhhhh ohh, yeah yeahhh {*3X*}</pre>
