(arrest the president *4X*)

[Farma G]
In the streets, the concrete playground
bent police, the beast won't lay down
I can't escape I'm nearin breakdown
I can't sleep in london town now
no sleep, no rest for the year round
handcuffed in the back of a beef van
no joy for the kinds in the junkyard
overcome by the truth, yeah, life's hard
all scarred from a life up on row
flip the coin see what life flows
wedged in an edgy atmosphere
self-destruction now catch the Fear
awkward anguish, could not vanish
lock in a cell severely brain damaged
think of a world gone loco-loco
step in the shoes of mister miserable
left no room for the holy-holy
walk in the steps of mister moanie
tangled lifestyles, complicated
modern day life is over-rated
fuck the states, yeah, ban the bomb
arrest the president, now sing that song!

arrest the president, he's the gun-slinger
arrest the president, he's the drug dealer
arrest the president, arrest the president, (fick 'im!)

[Chester P]
arrest the president, guns are trading
he's the outlaw on these pavements
kids get puff just for misbehavin'
in the Whitehouse guns are traded
some go there cuz there's ganja blazin'
up in parliament guns are trading
some choose crime as their occupation
they sell guns to destroy ya nation
who's the criminals? where's the justice?
we don't trust no judges' judgements
on these front-lines losin patience
who protect us, from their invasions?
we protect us, holding corners
police ain't welcome across the borders
arrest the president, he's the gangster
deep in scandals, dirty bankster
why harass me? I'm just strugglin'
makin' something out of nothing
it's the system arrest the president
we're victims, the world's evidence

arrest the president, he's the gun-slinger
arrest the president, he's the drug dealer
arrest the president, arrest the president
fuck 'im!</pre>
