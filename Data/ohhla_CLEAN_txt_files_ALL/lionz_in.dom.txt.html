Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino]
Lions in the jungle, they grow they mane at
When they start to rumble, it's all the same
Like when shorty tried to juggle, off his first bundle
NARC's on the block, they knock his whole hustle

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, I was a young lad, used to walk to school
With a tooly in my school bag, a Jansport
Seen niggas bodied on the ball court, in Stapleton
From P.S. 14 to 49, didn't make it to high school
I seen a life of crime, it was a little too violent
For my tender eyes, the things I did'll make momma cry
At fifteen, I started robbing niggas
By seventeen, started shooting niggas
Fucking with them Wu niggas, ask around my hood
I've always been rapping, but it's time for me to go platinum
Keep it real I shot vids in the P's
Even shot videos, for the kids and my seeds
Shot grimey shit, for the young thugs and the G's
Yeah, their was haters in the cut, but they ain't say shit to me
Matter fact, they inspired me, cuz I could be just like them
But I'd rather be me...

[Chorus 2X]

[Dom Pachino]
I was a young soul, to toughen me up
Was a man's role, but where was daddy at?
Probably in his Cadillac, pimpin' them hoes
Flipping the most, cocaine, drippin' his nose
He also did music, he was riffing the flow
Now his son is fitting to blow, way out of control
Hold heat like a deep fry, pot on the stove
Off probation, that listens to been self elevation
My concept is progress; motivation
Operation gray time, in due time, I'mma persue mine
And be seen worldwide like it's news time
Don't confuse mine with others, they get accustomed
I touch them, they're smothered, throw dirt on 'em
Damn P. done put a hurt on 'em
I had no choice, son, I had to pull a skirt on 'em
Drop a jewel on 'em, school 'em, I had to lay a word on 'em

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
