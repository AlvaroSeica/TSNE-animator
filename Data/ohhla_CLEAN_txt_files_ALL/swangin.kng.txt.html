[Hook - 2x]
Swanging, swanging
84's adapters, we throwed we cappers
Swanging, swanging
Whether chrome or gold, 24's we roll

[Tite]
I'm in that Bentley drop, black with the lacquer top
Paint sweating like it's hot, wheels refuse to stop
Hoes love Chalie and Tite, like Brian McKnight
24's on the shine, looking larger than life
We rap stars for real, with big cars and wheels
Haters try to pull us down, so we tuck in the steal
That's the way we ride, with big Texas pride
Plex denied, catch us in a Lexus ride
24's and spinners, diamond grill we grinners
Sometimes we sinners, at all times we winners
I gots to have it, with V-12 kick back
Then sit back, while this young cat spit that
I gots to do my thang, hit the block and slang
I gotta come up and stang, so 24's I swang
It's the D-3 nut, Chalie Boy what's up
Get in the truck, 24's kicking up dust

[Hook - 2x]

[Chalie]
It's the Summer time
So I'ma pull, out the dropper-eeer
Which one do I choose
The Lac's off or the Benz, hard topper
Sitting popper, on my 24's
On my favorite, the 84's
Screens on, flicks being shown
As I'm pissing off the shady homes
I'm a trunk breaker, certified show shaker
All the rims I found, why why
They certified Omega
Spre's on the Hummer
Labs on the Benz, in the winter
My series come soon, my life
Called the versatile now, when you see me I'm
