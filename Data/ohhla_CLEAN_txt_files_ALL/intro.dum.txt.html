[Intro: Dungeon Masta]
Do you hear what's about to come to you right?
See this is the intro to Wishful Thinking
I want ya'll to sit back, listen to the songs, get high right now
Do the knowledge to the lyrics
You will get your money's worth fucking with this shit
Get fucked up, vibe off this shit

[Dungeon Masta]
Destiny is written, prophecy's shall pass
The truth remains hidden (I shall not fall)
Negative forces weaken, your team will not last
Destiny is written (I shall not fall)

[Struxx Denali]
Our destiny's a little more vivid than yours
We put in blood, sweat and tears til it drips from our paws
Your team cheap soda, you a fucking Shasta
You running faster, cuz here come Dungeon Masta

[Dungeon Masta]
As I approach to ten, between space/time
You're a tricky devil, that just got over, have you lost your fucking mind?
You can never claim Dungeon's shine, parasitalic leech
Breached security, rip the mask off his face
When a plane, we have plenty of chunk space, for real
I don't want you to go and get emotional, for real</pre>
