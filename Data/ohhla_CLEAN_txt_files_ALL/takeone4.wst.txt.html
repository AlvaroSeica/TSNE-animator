[Chorus: Pusha T]
Doing my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what though, I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team

[Kanye West]
Haha, I'ma take this one for the team
GOOD Music, yeah, uh
You know what? I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies, gave it a nice try
You know what? I hate pictures of other people kids
I hate plastic couches in other people cribs
I hate when other people cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and I smell like the crypt
What's the cause of the poor smell?
She said "I just cleaned up baby, I can't tell"
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
or that goddamn cucumber Bath and Body Works
I can still smell the sweat, the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water? That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the Lodi Dodi verse
and my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score, he took the charge
Oooooh, that shit gotta hurt

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
Never mind me, 'Ye have fun
If the cops ask, that's my gun
That's my weed, anything you need
I'ma take, I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team
One fat ass, one flat ass
Nigga hit the switcheroo on my black ass
Ever seen Joe's Jeans on a jackass?
And my bitch got on tights with a tack ass
I'm a fly nigga and I carry on
with them bottles of that rose and Perignon
Ever seen how a kingpin carries on?
Dookie rope link chain and a herringbone
The real shit, gotta feel this
First-class flights baby, that's a field trip
Double date, don't cooperate, kill switch
Fuck me and my man, you a real bitch

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
Ladies and gentlemen
It's GOOD Music in the house
and we got Keri..

[Keri Hilson] + (Kanye West)
Boy I know you the one that I heard about (huh?)
I know you working with it through word of mouth
Looks like I'ma have to test you in and out
It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta
Take it for the team (huh?)
Take it for the team
Take it for the team (I like your mentality baby)
Take it for the team (hahah..)

[CyHi Da Prynce]
I'm blowing on stinky that come in a jar (CyHi)
Playing with her kitty made her cum in the car (CyHi)
She a redbone but her cousin is dark (CyHi)
A little out of shape but she'll fuck in the dark
Until she start complaining about her feet hurt
I'm tryna fuck, she talking bout she wanna eat first
I'm like "why did this bitch have to bring her?"
I'm tryna get her back to the nest so I could sting her
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer
I said "I got a chick for you that look like a singer"
On a scale of one to ten, she's a fifteener
You should have seen a nigga's face when he seen her
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger
On my team she would be a fifth stringer
I said "I got the fine one in the Beamer"
I'm the point guard and I need a winger
Take one for the team

[Keri Hilson]
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
GOOD Fridays
It's the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches, they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check, check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now, she get her back blew out
She can't clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet I'm going to sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her friend bust in, goddamn, who brought the raccoon out?
For the team, uh

Like we always do at this time
Like we always do at this time
I go for, I got to
Like we always do at this time
Like we always do at this time
Go for, I got to
Like we always do at this time, huh?
Like we always do at this time
South side, we gonna set this party off right
This time
This time
Yeah, yeah
Mike Dean on the keys
Hey, uh, they love to hate
Bad model bitches, they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check, check, check my swag and get up to date
Ay, it's the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check, check, check my swag and get, uh, ay</pre>
