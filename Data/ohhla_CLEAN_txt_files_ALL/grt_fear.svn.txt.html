[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah, Uh huh
Sometimes I wonder what more do I gotta do
I been pourin out my heart for years, You know
This is my greatest fear

[Verse 1]
Some say I'm sick, Cause of what my dreams depict in the midst of death
I hear the screams of hollowtips on the pistol's breath
Banana clips and the triple vest
Brethren, I'm lovin the ghetto that's governed by sips of the crystal meth
Niggaz'll put one in ya brain just to get respect
Please believe that where you slain, Is where you gettin left
I seen raindrops drippin from dead carcasses
And straight shots spit and they trippin off who the target is
We ain't grew up like the partridges
I watched my pahtna sniff lines of coke off the shine of 9 cartridges
The only good days are the ones the liquor sedates
I take a sip for my niggaz and pray that they get through the gates
I became popular from them weak niggaz poppin at me
They think I was choppin a key, But naw, I'm just hoppin cd's
I watched Jay get a deal and I feel I'm just as nice
I pray I get a mil before I'm killed, Nigga this is life

[Chorus]
They said my day would come, But it's been so long
So many tears to cry, And yet just 1 song
Somebody help me
And if I die today, Would they even care?
If I left this place without a trace, Then I was there

[Verse 2]
All I got is my heat and my art, My heart, My balls dawg, And my religion
Reality's depressing and got me stressin about my odds of livin
Cause I can see that they slim to none
Nicotine in my lungs, Mixing gin wit rum
Until I vomit up lyrics to wet poor tricks
That can captivate caskets and ressurect corpses
Then maybe I could see my brother again
I'm tryin to be righteous, But they'll only let me bubble in sin
I serve God, But the evil one be governing them
So what's the use of keepin it raw when they in love wit a trend?
They don't feel me, If I catch these years from another case
Which one of y'all gon wipe the tears from my mother's face?
So quit boxing us out dawg, Let us shine
Respect the grind, Maybe you made it, But the rest is dyin
This is for my niggaz that tryed even though they paid the cost
And every rapper that died long before they made the source

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I spit on 4 dudes, Then let the pro tools capture the song
Hopefully, The vocals'll last after I'm gone
Will my image diminish before I'm finished at the end of my race?
And they takin the bullets out the antonym to my face
Will you cry cause you neglected this young man an equal chance?
And an opportunity when you could've seen me advance?
Even as I'm writing, I'm enlightened that our hours passed
Damn mane, Most fans just drank from the hour glass
I pray daily they aid me when I'm seekin a deal
And I'm keepin it real when I'm sayin I sleep wit my steel
I write for hours to perfect the technique of my skill
Do I gotta put heat to my grill to show you what's deep what I feel?
Failure's a sea, And I'm stuck in it's wake drowning
Wit the thought I won't make it, Dark satan's my 8th album
Father forgive me, I'm tryin to fulfill purpose
But I'ma feel worthless until my skills surface

[Chorus]</pre>
