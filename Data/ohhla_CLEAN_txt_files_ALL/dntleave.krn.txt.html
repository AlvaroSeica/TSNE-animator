(*talking*)
Follow me, y'all want me to sing a negro spiritual
 
M-hmm-m-hmmm - 4x
 
[K-Rino]
I'm standing in the light, but the darkness overcrowded me
Guilt undoubtedly, is trying to eat it's way up out of me
I'm inbalanced spiritually, psychologically cosmicly
What you looking at is real, no trick photography
See I got a lot of sins, weighing on my consciousness
Knowing all my faults, makes me uncomfortable with compliments
Still daily I pray to win, mental roof caving in
Laboring to shake all the bad behavior, I'm bathing in
Every devil with satanic knowledge, I'm denouncing em
Cause when it counts, I can't benefit a ounce from your counseling
My visions rain, from giant pictures to wallet frames
Got a list aside of thangs, that I wish that I could change
My mind is stuck in the past, no hope there to be fed
Cause I can't turn the channel, like the remote battery's dead
And out my heart I can't tune it, although it's been years since I consumed it
It looms, and my soul is still wounded
 
[Hook]
Lord I'm trying, so please don't leave me
I plan on changing but, it's not easy
If I start walking to you, I know you'll meet me
I, can't let the forces of this world defeat me
(m-hmm-m-hmmm - 4x)
 
[K-Rino]
Got knowledge but I'm trifling, I just want my life again
God's the only friend you got, why the hell you fighting him
Chasing all these earthly things, my standards I set em low
The stuff I lust it never gave me jack, but I won't let em go
My past it be harassing me, I try to magically
Trash it but it recasts itself, with perfect accuracy
Confession, passive aggression
Is life daily past pre-destined, or left in our hands is the question
Whatever made you pursue me, please don't give those praises to me
I'm a foolish vessel, blessed to have the most high speaking through me
I'm greatful for whatever way, he might see fit to use me
Giving me the credit, only proves to me you never knew me
To the unperceptive kind, I appear to be blind
Maybe because I think with my heart, and I see with my mind
You looking at a work in progress, not yet solid
One stage is the evolution, this is not the finished product
 
[Hook]
 
[K-Rino]
Thangs seem hopeless, got great frustration
So how can I focus, and chase salvation
When my discipline is not, strong as temptation be
Come in new waves daily, creatively persuading me
Gotta be freed, with the revelation I recieve
To possibly be, an example of what I believe
The road, to accepting my own
It's true that I been hit with a few stones, but how many have I thrown
See my best I gave it, that test I aced it
But I feel like all this news that I'm making, is being wasted
Sadness kicks in, is it worth it my mind wonders
Still I understand, that strength is not always in numbers
I'm almost on empty, it's two doors within me
See one is God's door, and the other is where the sin be
So bring me, to where I'm meant to be through wise counsel
I win with you, but I'm less than nobody without you
