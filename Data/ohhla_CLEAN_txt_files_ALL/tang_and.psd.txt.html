Woke up early in the mornin'
Threw on a 'fit, grabbed my Motorola phone
And warmed up the engine to my ghetto ass hood hog
And put the leash on my brand new pit bull dog
Hit the switch for the deck and the Z-A-P
And let the 600 Watt Zeus funk with the EV's
Today's a good day to get my hop on
Up and down the strip while these bitches get they jock on
Hit House of Soul for scrambled eggs and a plate of grits
Raw steaks for my brand new pit 
It's a clear blue sky on the forecast
Hoes tryna flag my ride, but I blows past
Called up my cuddie for the spark
And he told me Gully Barbecue later on at the Crest Park
Young playas havin' fun at that
Leave your chrome at home, cuz it ain't gon' be none of that

Chorus:
Perkin' off the Tang and O.J.
Checkin' what yo' hoe say to me
Another day, just another day
In the V-A double-L-E-J-O

Headed for the detail shop to get a wax down
But the task put the jack down, lookin' for greens and cabbage
But I ain't on search and seizure, and my L's is valid
I shook the thought of gettin' a buff job
Struck to my broad's house, hit her with a rush job
Cuz I must mobb off in traffic
To my spot cut me down a ounce of dank, and bag it
Cuz at the picnic playas wants to choke off Mary
Sticky gooey dank, not that hay weed
And I'ma play Dr. Feelgood and help 'em live good
Picnic and get rich, I'm headed for the hood

CHORUS

Everythang's goin' sharp, runnin' cross a gang a broads
And I even saw some sahabs, but these niggas got some get right
Showin' love when shown love, tryin' to keep they shit tight
One time ain't sweatin' us, we gettin' tacked and sippin' Yak
And they ain't even checkin' us, 
we even got a sideshow jumpin' off on the black top
Niggas figure eightin' in the parkin' lot, giggin' to the sounds of Cease
Young niggas throwin' down, showin' signs of peace
Man, I tell you boy it sure feels good
To see these playas gettin' together from all hoods, it's all good
I seen some representing the O
Got some representing Sac, Richtown and Frisco
What they hit for? Playa dice games and dominos
Heffer hoes even get they money on 
And playa Stevie D is here to contribute
A bootch to the move on behalf of them dead troops
What was once a Crestside picnic is lookin' like a playa's ball
And we all at this
