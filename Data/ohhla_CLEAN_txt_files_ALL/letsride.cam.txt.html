[Camoflauge]
Gimme tha keys to tha car, I'm ready for war
When we ride on these niggas smoke that ass like a gar
Hit your block with a glock, clear the set with a teck
Like rain you gonna get wet that's a promise not a threat
You think I'm jokin, see if you laughing when tha pistol be smokin
Leave you head split wide open 
And you bones get broken
Shit you will be floatin out to sea like a bird with wings
When we ride on these niggas we bringing tha pure pain

[Hook]
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride,

Bust in that nigga wig and it startin to split
Hot shit gonna touch ya, bullets gonna rush ya
Like Lil' Cease I crush it, yea motherfucker
And when we ride it me homicide fo sho
And when we ride let em screamin let dem motherfuckers know
(let em know) Uh-huh that we ain't playin no games
Cockin tha glock on thier block and have their god damn brain

[Hook]
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, 
let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride,

[Camoflauge]

Don't ball on the phone call hey I holla at ya
Hey see ya later, have these hoes in ya Navigator
Holla through your shit like an at and a gator
Look player, I work with tecs, and I'm a Ak sprayer
And if you down to ride nigga say yeah
Buff buff nigga dip before you get fucked up 
Red dots make your forehaed easyer to touch
So what we bout to go hit em , let's go get em
Ride on these bitch made niggas and deal with em
Somebody please call him a ambulance
Get the boy some surgury as fast ya can
Y'all niggas better come up with a master plan
And I'm gonna ride with my niggas cause thats my man

[Hook]
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's ride,
