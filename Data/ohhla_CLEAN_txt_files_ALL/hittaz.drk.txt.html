Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]

[Chorus 2x]
Hitta, my niggas drilling, my niggas winning
Don't get hit up
My niggas chilling, my killas itching
Bitches, can't trust these bitches, these bitches tripping
In it, my niggas in it, we all hittaz

[Verse 1]
Hittaz, I call them hittaz
Don't get hit up on the lam
That's 64th
My niggas in it doing drills
I wake up early
That's when they snappin'
Say no lackin', that's when they lackin'
I love that feel of niggas leaking
These niggas cheesy
Shoutout to Reese can't relate
Fuck niggas, they hate
Hit 'em with that a or that Glock'a
I'm on my block'a
FN go frr-aah
That mini chopper, knock off his topper
L'z up, don't pick no shells up
That's that revolver
No face, that means there's no cage
That mean no topper
L's up, don't pick no shells up
That's that revolver
No face, that means there's no cage
That mean no topper

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
OTF, I ride for them
Angelo, I'd die for him
3hunnit, did time for them
Fuck niggas, no time for them
Catch a opp, make that 30 pop, eat that mind of his
Free Rex, bro just doing that time for shit, that savage shit
I told my hittaz they get locked up then I got em
Can't no nigga in the jam say I'm a liar
Real nigga, I'm loyal when I'm grinding
Imma start a riot
These niggas hate me
Ride into a AP
Clips on KD
Free Law, free T
White range like D
These bitches love me
These niggas copy
Throw them L'z up for them hittaz

[Chorus 2x]
