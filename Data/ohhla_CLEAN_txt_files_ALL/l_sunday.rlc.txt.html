[ CHORUS 2X ]
Yo, I need weed, give me Guns, give me Butter, Lord
My bags are packed, I'm 'bout to head out on another tour
I need a wife in my life, I'm tired of fuckin whores
Um, scratch that, hey yo, pass that

[ VERSE 1: Reef the Lost Cauze ]
Lazy Sunday shit, I'll love you one day, bitch
But for now I'ma just get high
I got that wild green, put on some Al Green
Take a seat, my dudes, how's things?
Me myself been strugglin lately
Think I'ma die soon, so I want me a baby
Huh? Why you laughin, nigga? Stop tryina play me
I know I shouldn't want a lady cause these bitches is crazy
But I'm on the road most times alone
When I get off the plane nobody there to take me home
Don't get me wrong, I love my life to the fullest but
Damn this L is tight, can't even pull it, cuz
Where was I? Damn, I forgot
Cut the game on nigga, I think it's on Fox
I'ma shoot to the store and grab me another Dutch
Order pizza or something, I'm hungrier than a motherfuck

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: Reef the Lost Cauze ]
Y'all heard that knew Ghost shit? Yeah, the joint with Beans
You don't like the new Wu? That shit is raw to me
Yo, what was good with that broad, the one from Mali
She looked good last night, I think her name is Maureen
She wasn't down to leave, some boy was on her sleeve
Are you kiddin me? Are you shittin me?
She's with that guy? The little fat guy?
Didn't we trash him last time and give him black eyes?
I gotta hit the bathroom
I told you not to order from Southside, they food is bad news
Little Ronnie got hit? Damn, that's bad news
I remember his sister from school, she was mad cool
Why you hooverin? Passed it like a hour ago
Y'all just devour my 'dro, I got more comin in a hour or so
But in the meantime twist up the green lime
Fuck the world, this my me-time
Fallin back with my crew puffin the ooze
The slime, I rhyme but I'm just a regular dude
Today I ain't rappin, I just wanna play Madden
Blaze cabbage and escape from the madness
