We live and learn, liquor makes the liver burn
Anxiety seeps through the epiderm
will Obama get a second term?
Only death is certain
will the human race ever learn
I make cheddar burn 
Get my point across in just 11 words
times are harder than they ever were 
Pain in my soul is hereditary
we forever search 
For the meaning of life in every turn 
Do we die and then return or go to heaven and splurge? 
Or freefall in the abyss of hell and then burn? 
Do we earn a pass to get us in first? 
Like night club promoters while god studies my motives 
Soul cleansing flushing my motor
hustle is in my culture
success 
Death sucks us in closer
now my heart is torn
pushing harder through the
storm 
Junk food in my belly now my arteries are worn
hard to see the wrong 
Part of me's torn
the good side of me's there but it's hard to reach to
him 
Bad economy
no stopping my movement while the poverty's booming 
Grinding till I'm in the driver seat cruising
no more privacy for humans
they YouTubing us 
Locked in this rubix cube of consumerism
worshipping the superficial 
No matter how long you run the truth will always hit you

Jewelz

Through my life I've seen all types of things
the good the bad the ugly 
What life can bring
through the heartaches and pain we find the strength
within 
We dig deep for what it takes to win (what it takes to win)
Mind over matter
we never mind the chatter
my rhyme chatter I grind until
I climb the ladder 
At night I shine like Las Vegas Nevada
on or off stage I'm manifesting the
latter 
See the symbolism as simple as I envision
choose words that I assemble
like Hieroglyphics 
It's all physics
written in the star systems
the positive comes to the
one that's optimistic 
My belief system kills obsolete wisdom
forces inside of me keep driving me
on my mission 
To free the captive I spit for kings and Cleopatras 
Dodging enemies in the Matrix with Neo backflips
homeopathic Pisces 
Zodiac is sick
crowd yelling homie threw me off with his accent 
Atlas throwing the earth off the axis
small minded rappers jerking off on
the mattress 
Talking about his chains and rims spinning 
When he goes out to clubs he gets brains from 10 women 
Now his fans don't believe him anymore
even worse his own man don't
believe him anymore 
Now the reason in your core's telling you to change 
The words from your songs putting you to shame 
And now you out the game
no one will truly miss you 
No matter how much you run the truth will always hit you</pre>
