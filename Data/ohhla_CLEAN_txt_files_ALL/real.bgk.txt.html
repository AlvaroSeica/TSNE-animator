[Dresta]
Knock knock
[BG Knocc Out]
Who's there ?
[Dresta]
Well its the gang S-T-A-ster
[BG Knocc Out]
The gangsta who ?
[Dresta]
Yo its your brother gangsta Dresta
Open up the door so I can flow and let 'em know
That me and BG Knocc is good to go to make the dough
Thats my little brother, thats my dog, thats my nigga
I'm the big brother cos i'm older and i'm bigger
Here to clock the ends and hit the skins on the daily
My little brother BG Knocc he drives the girlies crazy
Close like buddies but yo he mo' than my brother
We got two others and CC is our mother
Grew up in Compton and the bootys on the westside
Used to live in the eastside but we chose the bestside
Had it kinda rough but that only made us tough
We don't take much stuff, we kick up nuff dust
Trust no hoe, or no man, shit can't even trust each other
And even though I love her, time for me to drop my mother
And thats just the way we was raise back in the days
Me, myself and I from the cradle to the grave
Never had a daddy, damn right i'mma bastard
Mama was my daddy because daddy wasn't a factor
Don't feel bad because I don't need a dad
Its like this, I can't miss what I never had

[Dresta]
So nickidy Knocc can you come and wreck the set ?
[BG Knocc Out]
Yes!
[Dresta]
So won't you grab the microphone and flex next
[BG Knocc Out]
Yes!

[BG Knocc Out]
Well its the nickidy Knocc ready to pop like a glock
With my brother D-R-E and we back on the block
As these funky cluck hoes fuck all on the duck
But for now my time is taken, so bitch you gets naythin
Microphone check, hit the deck, if you can't take the heat
Original baby gangsta's straight from the street
With the beat that'll bump in the trunk of your shit
So nigga bump this and I bet you bump a bitch
With the quickness cos i'm quick to kick some dope shit
K-N-O-double C-O-U-T will always make a hit
And we'll never flip flop, always keep it hip hop
A nigga dissin on my bro, watch him fall like a drip drop
From the faucet, show me the mic and watch me toss it
And kick some derranged shit to make you think i've lost it
Ah shit, i'm ready to rock i'm ready to roll and rock
So give a nigga some room before I tick and I tock
And explode like a bomb with the mic within my palm
Won't you take a walk with me through the Compton Vietnam
And let me show ya, fools much bolder
A busta is a punk compared to a fuckin soldier
Act like you know, i'm a pro with a hell of a flow
Kickidy K to the O, ain't no motherfuckin joke, so
Step to a loc and prepared to get smoked
By me and my motherfuckin big bro

[BG Knocc Out]
Now Gangsta Dresta can you come and wreck the set ?
[Dresta]
Yes!
[BG Knocc Out]
Now can you grab the microphone and flex next
[Dresta]
Yes!

[Dresta]
Well here I am, once again its the Dresta
Straight outta Compton, original baby gangsta
Quick to grab the microphone and come and start some conflict
Never seen a convict, come and drop the bomb shit
Take a good look because your lookin at a crook
My life done been took, right outta Donald Owens book
See I did the crime so I did the time
But now i'm back out, packin my nine
Scoopin up girls with the the swiftness
And if its possible to stick 'em with the quickness, i'm with this
I'll really don't need a girl but I do need a friend
To give me some love, slap on the girlfriend hit the skins
Packin the ends, payin the bills with my skills
Never hesitate to tell somebody how I feel
Me and my brother Knocc he doin damage in the 90's
I was down straight from 88 up to 93
That was like 5 years my little brother didn't have it, broke
Around to help me go down the right path
But i'm back out and we tighter than we've ever been
Tryin to make some ends so we can go where we never been

[Dresta]
Now nickidy Knocc can we come and wreck the set ?
[BG Knocc Out]
Yes!
[Dresta]
Why won't we grab the microphone and flex next
[BG Knocc Out]
Yes!

[Dresta]
Me and my nigga Knocc Out
[BG Knocc Out]
We'll sock out
A fool without no hesitation
[Dresta]
And split him up like segregation
[BG Knocc Out]
So when you steppin, you testin your luck
[Dresta]
Yeah fool and with nutter get your ass fucked up
[BG Knocc Out]
So stay off the diznick, you little triznick
[Dresta]
Knoccy niznick hit his ass with the pipe
[BG Knocc Out]
Dre catch him with the right
[Dresta]
Yeah, i'mma dog but I don't bark
[BG Knocc Out &amp; Dresta]
We take a punk nigga to a park, bust caps in the mark
Knocc and Dre here we go again, with the flow again
From the westside, C-O-M-P-T-O-N
Compton, Compton is what niggas yellin
And hoes on my diznick everytime we bellin
Question after another, yo we got the same mother
Bitch so we real brothas</pre>
