J Formz: Listen, if you from Staten, you rep for Staten, if you know people
from Staten, even if you in Staten, stand the fuck up! Let em' know your
reppin' for Ghostown. Make some mutha fuckin' noise, and let these haters know we
in this mutha fucker tonight son, and we takin' ova! Ghostown!

[Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna do cause dog, we could set it off
I'm tellin' you, I got my crew, and dog, we aint gettin' soft
So if you wanna grill my crew, tell you what it's gonna cost
You could lose a life or 2, just because you're poppin' off

[J Formz]
Step up in the club and these haters wanna kill you
But they only got the balls to stand there and grill you
So put your middle finger up if you don't give a fuck about em'
Look em square in the eyes and tell em' that you fuckin' doubt em'
Ghostown's up in this bitch, better believe it
If you don't like it, too bad, cause dog, we aint leavin'
I'm nasty with the hands, and you can take it to the bank
So you better be willin' to throw up more then what you drank
There's no reason to speak, dog just do somethin'
So if I hear your fuckin' voice, I'mma take it you frontin'
I'm on stage with no vest and a big chain
So if you not playin' games then take fuckin' aim
Put the beam on my head, blow out my brain
Better know I aint playin', I aint just actin' insane
So for all you jealous cats, I keep it simple and plain
Let em' know, what's my name? Formz, Formz, Formz!

[Chorus] - 2X

[J Formz]
These haters don't even get it, they inspire me to write
The only way they gettin' me to stop is if they end my life
Even Wunda had to tell em' that we seem nuts
So Ghostown, throw your mutha fuckin' G's up!
Let these haters know, they fuckin' with the wrong crew
Talkin' reckless? keep it movin' when my people swarm you
Frontin' like we aint got guns or nuthin'
You aint that hard dog, you must be drunk or somethin'
I aint playin' no games, so don't disrespect my set
Before I come off the stage and disconnect your neck
Rip apart your crew, I aint start with you..
We could have a cipher dog, my gun's sparkin' you
So if you mad cause you rhyme and think that you're hot
Relax dog, I'll give you a featurin' slot
And if you got it stuck in your head you're better then me son
Come on stage and battle me in front of everyone

[Chorus] - 2X

[J Formz]
I rep for Staten and I don't know why you hate
Rep for every borough inside of NY state
We've both been though it, movin' weight for more
So I don't know why you wanna go and hate me for

I rep for Staten and I don't know why you hate
Rep for every borough inside of NY state
We've both been though it, movin' weight for more
So I don't know why you wanna go and hate me for

J Formz: Fuck em! Nah'm sayin', fuck all these haters. Ghostown</pre>
