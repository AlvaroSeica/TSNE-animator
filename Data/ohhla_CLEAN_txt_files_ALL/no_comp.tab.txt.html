[Intro: Phonte] (Kweli)
OOH~! One time for ya mind, baby
(We break it down like)
One time for ya mind, baby
One time for ya mind, baby
(We break it down like)
One time for ya mind, baby
(We break it down like)
One time for ya mind, nigga
(How you do it? How you do it?)

[Talib Kweli]
My nigga Khrysis be offerin you some heat, yup
You other rappers I'm offerin you a seat
Matter fact, take several, park it like valet
Page is the opera, the writing is ballet
If your taste is exquisite then maybe you'll make a visit
To a place where you can get it, support it and make a difference
That's of course that's only if the recording remain consistent
Then you make a straight line to the store, the shortest distance
To travel the globe over the rainbow, the pot of gold
My career is to the point where I've learned to enjoy the road
Taking flicks in front of famous cathedrals
Sip mojitos on the beaches of Rio, with Bobbito
Mardi Gras in the streets with Phontigallo
Stopped at Curren$y crib for some extra loud piff to blow 
(Yep!) Hit this tree, pound the smoke digital
If I diss niggaz no subliminals, no syllable rap
They say I'm off beat, the flow criminal
Y'all niggaz just beat off but no centerfolds
Y'all niggaz softer than some dinner rolls
Tay, all these fake niggaz been exposed

[Chorus: Phonte] (Kweli)
OOH~! One time for ya mind, baby
(We break it down like)
One time for ya mind, baby
(We break it down like)
One time for ya mind - ELZHI

[Elzhi]
I come through, gear fresher
Flows tighter than clothes in a queer dresser
We'll have you leap from a pier, we'll call it peer/pier pressure
You've been hoaxed, tell your kinfolks
I give beats heart attacks, pen strokes, lead poison pencils
Turn anthems to lullabies and lobotomize instrumentals (OOH~!)
You traumatized so you stop, tears stalling
Is it wrong I, make the song cry to get the top tier fallin
Doughboys say I'm swagged to death
I'm bad ass to the white kids baggin meth
I spit fire, you just got the dragon breath
Your ex off the rag and effed, luckily I had a Magnum left
I pointed right where her thong at, and knocked it loose 
and like Dr. Seuss, I gave the cat the long hat
You shift the bed with this gift instead
Ill as pointing an infared at an infant head
And.. that's a bad look, like on the nights when your dad cook
Wishin he had took, culinary courses with a grad book
Fuck your sorry flows and your sad hook
I'm still glad that you mad shook, Elzhi

[Chorus: Phonte] (Kweli)
OOH~! One time for ya mind, baby
(We break it down like)
One time for ya mind, baby
(We break it down like)
New Tigallo New Tigallo New Tigallo

[Phonte]
Yo, the audio controller
12-bar cardio, rap game Giorgio Moroder Tigga
Told ya, I soldier through the coldest winters
Now the jeans sittin right where they supposed to fit him
The battle fill ink but no beginners
Not braggin I just had to be clear
Go'n and grab you a chair whether she dark skin or Vanity Fair
Give me a chick rockin natural hair and red roses in 'em
And I'm an animal - nah, I'm an on-imal 
Oops! I mean honorable, giving you niggaz what you paid for
I +Lay-law+ like Derek &amp; the Dominos
Play your position with me? Call it an honor roll
Test me, God bless your soul
I'm bugging out, call pest control, nigga +Vamamos!+
To the west coast, eatin Won Tons
With Krondon screamin, "Fuck one time for Guantanamo"
We shoulda did this shit a long time ago
Cause every single line, every rhyme I wrote (OOH~!)
It's nothing but that scheduled two opiates
Stimulants, yeah nigga all kids of dope
I'm am Langston meets Slang Ton
Don't need a track for that bottom feeder rap 
You niggas is plankton, a AK to a paint gun
Competition? Nigga it ain't none... at all
Hahaha!

OOH~! One time for ya mind, baby
One time for ya mind, nigga
One time for ya mind, nigga
One time for ya mind, baby
One time for ya mind, nigga</pre>
