[Intro by Announcer]
And now, give it up for your own...

[Tony Touch Scratches]
"...Live Wunz..."
"...Certainly the nicest emcees around..."
"...Bringin' the flava on the street and on the mic..."

[Free]
I rip rock like can-I-bus, When I bust, I thrust
Like a superheroic figure, You can't trust
Shit I say, Or the way I talk
Cuz I spit rhymes and am known as the illest in New York
Live from Mardi Gras, Fuck that I stay real
Free muthafucka, Hear the name you know the deal
(crowd cheering)
You stupid, You wanna fuck wit Yonkers and end up dead
Watch me now as I move like lightning and cut of your head
Now your red, But what did you expect
When you fuck wit a Live Wun, he put your ass in check

[Slim Pete]
Y-O to da N-K, Quick to spray
Ask to many questions, Meet your last day
It really, Get me mad the artists rappin' today
Half of them out there record bullshit records
And expect play
Ya heard, My word, My life and all
Come to a violent end if you ever catch me out of Yonkers ya'll
So Tony Touch if down with the crowd...
Spin the records, turn the volume up loud

[Tony Touch Scratches]
"...Live Wunz..."
"...Certainly the nicest emcees around..."
"...Bringin' the flava on the street and on the mic..."

[Theif]
Ya'll got beef wit us, huh?   (crowd cheers)
Ya'll got beef wit us, huh?   (crowd cheers louder)
I can't hear ya'll...		(crowd cheers louder)
Okay, Touch, stop that shit, turn that shit off!
If you muthafuckaz want me to kick a freestyle I wanna
hear ya'll Wild Out!		(crowd goes nuts)
HERE WE GO! Yo
I pack more guns than Bill da Kid
I chainsaw more bitches than Leatherface did, Cuz I'm
Crazier than any emcee rappin' today, At least the new ones
For the pioneers I gotta give the respect away
I get more love, Than a bitch six feet deep
And like Jeff Goldblum, I'm into deep
But not that drug shit, Or organized crime
I already di time, No I do rhyme
And that shit there is more dangerous than narcotics
Cuz (the rest of this line is blurred)
* He cracks on the label he is signed to *

[Sample from the movie "Juvenyles"]
...These people are not to be fucked with
Approach only with the utmost respect for there
Violent capabilities and warlike tactics(echoed)
