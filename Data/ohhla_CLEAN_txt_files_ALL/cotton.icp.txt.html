Wibble wobble bumble boo, I'm Violent J, nice to meet you
Hop and jump the cherry pump [cherry syrup on ice cream], yum
What you say I buy you some, what's your name bitch, where you from
You know me but don't be scared [bloody hands are weird] I know
Don't front girl, you like us thugs, very scary, carny scrubs
You don't want no Richie faggot [I think of Shaggy when he tag it]
That's all good, I'll hook you up, send your shit I'll look you up
You met J though he goes first, yeah cause that's like how it works, slut
I can put aside my axe, give your butt a couple smacks
Once you let me all up in, you're lucky if we'll meet again

I don't wanna lemon ben and jerry baby, don't you wanna
I don't wanna tropicana dairy baby, don't you wanna
I don't wanna coconut a flurry baby, don't you wanna, mix
Cotton candy and popsicles

You from Dallas, Texas, right, you must be girl, you look tight
Plus you rock a grip of ass [thank you Shaggy sweetness]
Thank you nothin' let me hit it, truffle shuffle, waffle biscuit
Whatever that was we ate cost me like thirteen, fifty-eight
[Sugar bear, I'm worth all that], shit, bitch I'll smack you call me that
[What] call me Shaggy, southwest thug, Juggalo isle of Zug
Do him what you did to me, with your tongue ring and your teeth
[Only when in private] you think I wanna see his dick
Peace, put your candy down, let me show your tongue around
Here's my popsicle and balls, get on your knees and go for yours

I don't wanna watermelon cherry baby, don't you wanna
I don't wanna tropicana berry baby, don't you wanna
I don't wanna blue banana sherry baby, don't you wanna, mix
Cotton candy and popsicles

I don't wanna lemon ben and jerry baby, don't you wanna
I don't wanna tropicana dairy baby, don't you wanna
I don't wanna coconut a flurry baby, don't you wanna, mix
Cotton candy and popsicles

*Scratches*

I don't wanna watermelon cherry baby, don't you wanna
I don't wanna tropicana berry baby, don't you wanna
I don't wanna blue banana sherry baby, don't you wanna, mix
Cotton candy and popsicles

I don't wanna lemon ben and jerry baby, don't you wanna
I don't wanna tropicana dairy baby, don't you wanna
I don't wanna coconut a flurry baby, don't you wanna, mix
Cotton candy and popsicles</pre>
