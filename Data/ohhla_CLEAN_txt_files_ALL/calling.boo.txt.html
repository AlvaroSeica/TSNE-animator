Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You ever had a piece of pussy man, that be on your mind like money?
(Yo like for real doe) like money?
Good joule, good joule, hahaha
Fosho fosho
Pussy [x7]

[Chorus]
That pussy keep calling me (calling me)
Damn! Get me in trouble
That pussy keep calling me (come here Boosie)
Calling me (come here Boosie), calling me
Get me in trouble

[Boosie]
You ever had a piece of pussy so good and tight
That you hear dat pussy talkin at night "cum here"
Lingerie drive you crazy when she put it on
Safe sex but sometimes I hate to put it on
Make me moan, grab my back and pull me deeper
She catch 3, I catch 2, now I'm sleepin in
Ms. Virgina take her time when she hit dat head
She pull her long hair back and sit between my legs
Blow your mind when you got a dime
Who rub your nuts when you fuck her from behind
I ain't lyin', some special bout her
Got me sneakin out da house like a fuckin mouse
And that pussy so wet for me
She my Ecstasy (crazy)
Pussy damn near betta den ya ol lady
I prolly need to stop answerin da phone
Fuckin her, I fuck around and have my family gone
She get me rite when we fuck (when we fuck) yeaaaaah!
She put ice on my nuts (when we fuck) yeaaaaaah
Got me textin and shit I ain't never texted before
Got me eatin that pussy I ain't never ate before

[Chorus]
That pussy keep calling me (keep on calling me, keep on calling me)
Get me in trouble
That pussy keep calling me (keep on calling me, keep on calling me)
I know I can't love her but
That pussy keep calling me (keep on calling me, keep on calling me, keep on calling me)
That pussy keep calling me (keep on calling me, keep on calling me)
Get me in trouble

She's so cute, you not quick when you face to face
So I turn her from the back and grab her by da waist (turn around)
Dick hard when I see her, fatal attraction
Freaky bitch eat the dick while I'm playin Madden
Move my chain and give me brain, that's a chain reaction
Drop my top and let her lick - lick - lick my lollipop
Lay on your stomach girl (just like this), toot that ass up (toot it up)
Bite the pillow while a real nigga smash her
Pussy wet year round, that's that seattle pussy
One call this all I gotta have da pussy
Misses studio time, tellin my niggas lies
That pussy on me like flies on a shit pile
Call my phone and tell me sweet things
Put her on a purple kush now when we roll it's a G-thang
And when we get in bed, I feel her cumin' ahh
I feel her her cumin' ahh, she feel me cumin' ahh

[Chorus]
That pussy keep calling me (keep on calling me, keep on calling me)
Get me in trouble
That pussy keep calling me (keep on calling me, keep on calling me)
I know I can't love her but
That pussy keep calling me (keep on calling me, keep on calling me, keep on calling me)
That pussy keep calling me (keep on calling me, keep on calling me)
Get me in trouble</pre>
