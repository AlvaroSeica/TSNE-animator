Now I was miles outside Brussels when the sun began to fade
I'm thinking bout my life and whose it is I'm trying to save
We living for the hope that tomorrow is better
We can commiserate or liberate our sorrow together
I choose the latter
And I approve this data, to be analyzed
Time to deal with the tangibles
Not fantacize and pantomime
We've not been given manuals
But we all given fire so let's light that wick let the candle shine
Got my finger on the pulse of eternity
Cut these ropes of uncertainty 
each page stained burgundy
terminating evil until my words merge with purity
Hold me down let's infiltrate the insecurity
I know it now 
I seen the world surrounded and down 
Knowing I can build it up instead of breaking it down
All my "Gone till Novemberists"
Passport Memberships
Got it cause we took it... "didn't ask for it" fellowship

Chorus (2X)

Upon the road I will find every piece of my soul
Letting go the only time I can feel in control
And I Know.....
You can't go home again
You can't go home again
You can't go home again
You can't go home again


I'm a man about town anywhere I touch down
Don't want much just to touch the hand in the crowd
All i can say, is it's getting harder to play
along with... the same song script of modern decay
And plays on and on,
the broken record syndrome
With hope to perfect the rhythm within him thats gone astray
And you looking at every move as a chance to learn
As you swing from every mood of the plans you burned
Looking back to where you grew and knowing you can't return
Heart-breaking you lay awake it's creating concern.
Screaming at a fevered pitch
Every night it leads to this
A leisurely stroll within his soul to find the piece that fits
As words echo through like a broken breeze
A spirit born to drift like the open seas
Open fist to the sky for every single hope we bleed
Open market for hopes and dreams
And to cope we leave.

Chorus (2X)

And it blows in the wind 
Can lose focus again
And now ya know that you can't go home again
You remembered the words from a friend
Don't ever, ever, ever, ever, ever look back Nope
Never again
Hoping that there true 
If he had to place faith in anyone that it'd be you
And your humbled by the fact 
that anyone even cares
You can't go back home because that boys no longer there
That boy became a man,
Executed a plan
That crawl morphed to a walk
Stopped and took a stand
now he's got marketing plans
onlookers and fans
Still look up to the sky 
keep in touch with your fam
Packing up, moving out,
Showing how
You never slowing down
Got moves to make, But in the meantime 
Hold me down
Pardon the way I'm lviing
But long as the world's spinning 
I can only live it by these conditions
I know.....

Upon the road I will find every piece of my soul
Letting go the only time I can feel in control
And I Know.....
You can't go home again
You can't go home again
You can't go home again
You can't go home again</pre>
