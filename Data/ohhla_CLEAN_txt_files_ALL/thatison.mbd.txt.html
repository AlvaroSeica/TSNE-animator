[Chorus]
If you wanna kick it with me tonight
I'll take you home (I'll take you home)
And baby when I turn off all the lights
That thing is on

[Mo B. Dick]
Baby come next to me
We got a mutual feeling and it's ecstacy
Don't ask why
cus I feel your vibe
the way your lookin at me
I know it's on your mind
slow dance
thinkin of romance
when I look in your eye you put me in a trance
if you please
come home with me
we can make this one night into eternity

[Chorus]

[Mo B. Dick]
Ooh-wee you're so sexy
You can't imagine the things that you do to me
come on girl
I want you in my world
You got me tweakin for you like I'm on that {?}
You and I
we can wine and dine
the feelin tells me that I'm trickin for you but baby I don't mind
so what you gonna do
we wont become for you
forget the rest of the world
It's all about me and you

[Chorus]

I can take you for a trip around the world in one night baby</pre>
