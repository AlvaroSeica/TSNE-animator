[Hook]
We mobbing, and you know we never gon stop mayn
We mobbing, pulling out my slabs for them bops mayn
We mobbing, and a lot of these cats gon jock mayn
We mobbing, we forever gon be mobbing to the top mayn

[Trae]
I'm pulling out my slab, and swanging glass on grass
About to smash on gas I'm straight up acting a ass, so many shops on jock
We got the rap game locked
So many dots on my glock, I gotta dodge the cops
And we too hot to try and way too cold to hold, my story gonna unfold
I'm garunteed to be gold
You see me and my kin, we straight up in it to win
I'm thinking 600 Benz, with 20 twins'll spin we all in

[Dougie D]
Yeah we mobbing to the top, it don't stop
Pulling out the slab for them bops, and watch the ass end hop sitting on chops
Boys gon jock, and talk that nasty must
We Guerilla Maab 3D2, worldwide stupid fucks
Yeah we all up in y'all ear, I know y'all hear us when we coming
Coke and the Rum and the Henny, in my stomach got me crunking
Ready to fuck some'ing, that's the way it goes baby girl
It's the Trae and the Dougie, mobbing across the world

[Hook]

[Dougie D]
Ding-ding and the bellies roam, we back up in your shit
Got you loving this, like the dogs love Kibbles-n-Bits

[Trae]
And now we dominating thangs, with wood grain on planes
And 3D2 is the name, from state to state we stang

[Dougie D]
I'm a natural born playa, self made millionaire
Got to get up and get out, and go and get it everywhere
Pull my plan of execution, execute the plan to perfect
First week of record sales, talking bout hitting 'em where it hurting
I'ma bleed out the game, until it can't be bled no mo'
See me on the video, and selling out at every show

[Trae]
Guerilla Maab is the team, my briefcase full of cream
Is how I take my green, I'm living out my dream
I'm slamming do's on hoes, and burning off on 4's
And Lord knows I'm thoed, when I'm hopping in playa mode
Ain't no Kenan Cole, I'm sporting Gucci and 'Sacci
I know these cats gon knock me, but now ain't one gon stop me

[Hook]

[Trae]
Now the ways of life, is straight up mash for it baby
We make 'em lock up they ladies, when we mobbing in a Mercedes
See the big bubble lights, they make the light of the night
That make streets look bright, they blind-side on sight
I pop trunk with screens, and bang glocks of shake
And make 'em yell earthquake, with all the noise I make
I'm balling out of control, and riding blue over grey
We three deep with Reign, posted up in the turning lane know I'm saying

[Dougie D]
Ay-ay, it ain't easy being me
I'm a pimp playa and a mack, and a certified G
Better get your shit right, get your twisted mind together
We be changing up the game, like all of the changing weather
Mm-hm, y'all ain't know the flow just spit make y'all say man
Maabing click, we popping up out of Caravans
We from H-Town Texas, and we came to let ya know
Guerilla pimping on you chickens, and mobbing up on you hoes

[Hook]

(*talking*)
3D2-3D2 (3D2)
What we doing-what we doing (what we doing)
What-what what-what (what-what)
And it don't stop-and it don't stop (and it don't stop)</pre>
