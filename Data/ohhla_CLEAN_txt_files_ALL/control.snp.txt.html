[Intro] (talking)
Niggaz
Get ya Miller Geniune Draft, 'cause it's Miller Time
We 'bout to go hard on these hoes wit this one right here

[Chorus]
Can you control yo hoe?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yo hoe
She hard-headed and she just won't obey
Can you control yo hoe?
You got to know what to do and what to say
Listen.

You got to put that bitch in her plaaacce
Even if it's slappin' her in her face
You got to control yo hoe..

Can you control yo hoe?

[Verse] (Snoop laughing)
I came to your house
Your girl came in and started cursin' you out
You shoulda slapped her in her face
I wanted to tell you, but it wasn't my place
I kept on the low
'Cause I knew that you was gonna check that hoe
But, you were quiet as a mouse
Made me start to think that it wasn't your house (house)
'Cause she was acting like a nut
You got the kind of bitch that will kick your butt
What kind of pimp holds back
Never met a bitch that a pimp can't slap (ha)
What's wrong with the pimpin'
Why you gettin' a whippin'
All I see is simpetttes

[Chorus]
Can you control yo hoe?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yo hoe
She hard-headed and she just won't obey
Can you control yo hoe?
You got to know what to do and what to say
Listen.

You got to put that bitch in her plaaacce
Even if it's slappin' her in her face
You got to control yo hoe..

Can you control yo hoe?

[Hook]
This is what you made me do
I really didn't wanna put hands on you
But, bitch you playing with fi-ire
I'm so sick and ti-ired
Of loud mouth bitches like you
A nigga had to go and put tips on you
'Cause bitch you playing with fi-ire
I'm so sick and ti-ired

This is what you forced me to do
I really didn't wanna put hands on you
But, bitch you playing with fi-ire
I'm so sick and ti-ired
Of loud mouth bitches like you
So a nigga had to go and put tips on you
Bitch you playing with fi-ire
I'm so sick and ti-ired

[Chorus]
Can you control yo hoe?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yo hoe
She hard-headed and she just won't obey
Can you control yo hoe?
You got to know what to do and what to say
Listen.

You got to put that bitch in her plaaacce
Even if it's slappin' her in her faaace
You got to control yo hoe..</pre>
