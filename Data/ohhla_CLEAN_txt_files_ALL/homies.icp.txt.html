(Violent J) 
Let me ask you this about this life we live 
And let me try to swerve some of this attention you give 
To them distant ass relatives over in Ham dinner 
If they miss you so much why don't they just call a (motherfucker) 
If you wasn't blood, would you still have love?
Or infact does the blood make you think you have to love?
Look I probably love my family more then anybody here 
But my homies are family too Third cousins get outta here 
Who was you with when you got tatoos? 
Who was you tripping with when you did them mushrooms? 
Who the fuck threw up all over your car? 
And then felt worse then you about that shit in the morning? (Friends ya'll) 

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Who loaned ya money, homie? Who owes ya cash? 
Who taught you how to use a bong for the grass?
I don't know much but I gotta assume 
When ya hit ya first neden, ya homies was in the other room 

(Chorus)
We talkn' about HOMIES HOMIES!!! (Talkn' about road dogs of mine!)
Our motherfucking HOMIES HOMIES!!! (We throwin' up Clown Love signs!) 
Real juggalo HOMIES HOMIES!!! (Talk about those dogs of mine!) 
HOMIES HOMIES (Man that's my dogg)

(Violent J)
Have you ever had a job that you truly dispise? 
Like I dunno maybe dishwashing or fucking flipping fries 
Then you got this boss who thinks he's the don mega Cause he the head manager 
Cheap chili fry makerAll you could vision is ya'll beating him down 
Your homies standing on his back while you kicking his head around 
But responsibility is there, I can't lie tho 
I would a been plucked his fucking eyeball out with a chicken bone 
Crazy as fuck I'll rip your peircings off 
And now my homies are holding me back so I don't look soft 

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
When you snuck the car out who did you get?
And when you got caught, who you blame that shit?
Who you relax around and scratch yo balls? 
Homies,were talking about like you and yours!

(Chorus)
We talkn' about HOMIES HOMIES!!! (Talkn' about road dogs of mine!) 
Our motherfucking HOMIES HOMIES!!! (We throwin' up Clown Love signs!) 
Real juggalo HOMIES HOMIES!!! (Talk about those dogs of mine!) 
HOMIES HOMIES (Man that's my dogg) If ya don't like me ya can Fuck Off!!  
(Got a bullet for every one)If ya don't like me ya can Fuck Off!! 
(Got a bullet for every one)

(Jamie Madrox)
Me and my homies stay tight like a noose 
And if you step to one of us you betta step to the whole crew 
I never knew that I could depend 
That I could have some friends that's down til the very end 
Well that's my home boys, excuse me, my family 
And when we conquer the world 
We macking on the galaxy cause the skys the limit 
And we ain't finished 
And if my homies gonna ride ya know I'm with it 

(Monoxide Child)
Puff it and pass it and I give it to my homies ya'll 
Hit it and quit it and then I give it to my homies ya'll 
I got the world around my finger with my homies ya'll 
And everything is obsilete unless I hear my homies call 
We worldwide, were homies across the planet 
Sticking together like zippers on Michael Jackson's 'Beat It' jacket 
They got my back like a tat for that, I love ya'll 
Hanging till we old and grey like grandpa (Psychopathic) 

(Chorus)
