(laughin)
Hey yo, Chris Gunn
Drop me some of that
Good ole gangsta shit
Home boy
You know how we do it

[Knightowl]
When I step in the party
I got's to get naughty
So break out that bottle of barcardi
That 1 51 got's that bald head spinnin
I'm winnin since the beginin
All the battles that been simon
You know I gotta be the fool that's always
That's on top
Knightowl's breaks em off
Servin fools like a waiter I'm greater
You'll turn bitch like a raider
I'm not the one that's back stabbin
But I'll be the one that grabbin
Like tits I be saggin
My threads got to fit kinda of loose
Some what like pussy get's after you fuck it
Check it, I'm the one that'll wreck it
You best respect it or end up disected
My name be the one that you envy
So now I got to send the middle finger
To the rest of your crew mothafucka

[Chorus]
Do it do it Knightowl do it
Do it homie do it
Do it Knightowl do it
Like a mtohafuckin G
[2x]

[Knightowl]
Well I'm back once again
With a mothafuckin style that'll bump
All them lyrics come tight when I dump
On a track there ain't no holdin back when I bust
Knightowl be the one to wear em out like rust
Come get some of this and see what'll happen
Must I remind you
That you should never rap in front of me fool
I'm the best all around
I got the sound that is straight underground
Who needs the mothafuckin radio I don't
Just cause I won't kiss no ass they won't play me
I don'tr give a mad fuck they can suck on a big fat dick
My balls you can lick
Get off my nut sack it's me that you wish you can be like
I don't bite like Mike
So evrybody gather around and Listen
And see what the fuck you be missin

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
Mess with this vandal a guarantee scandle
I'm lightin mothafuckas up like a candle
You'll never be able to handle a man of my calibur
You'll end up a cadver
My dagger be pokin mothafuckas in the rib
I am not some fool so I will not let you live
Die mothafucka die you know my name
Knightowl be the one to make that hit when I aim
Never miss when I blast put em all in the past
I'll be up on that ass make you lose like the Jazz
Untouchable lyrical bald headed thug
And I feel no remorse but of course
I gotta keep smokin it's you that's provokin
Now on your own fuckin blood you'll be chokin
You messed with the wrong vato yo te mato
I'm gone mothafucka alrato

[Chorus]</pre>
