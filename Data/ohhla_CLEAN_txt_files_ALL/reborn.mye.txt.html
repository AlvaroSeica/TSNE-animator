"As many of you no doubt know
 This is a very special and historic night in the history of show business
 No man has given more, asked less or been more needed
 A decade and a half of wit, insight, knowledge and entertainment was your gift to us"

[Kam Moye]
This is the biggest moment of my life, maybe the last one I'll ever get
It's heaven scent, cause at this level now I can use every cent
The world's looking like you gon' Kobe or Chris Webber it
But I don't succumb to pressure, not ever
Every bone in my body would probably have to be broken to break me
They can't disable my greatness with label slavery
I'm stepping above it, the rap Frederick Douglas, the black
heads are gon' love it, this is freedom over break beats
I feel reborn like a Christian basking in holy water
I feel reformed like a prisoner free holding his daughter
Got an optimistic vision now when vocals recorded
Why would I stay in the past? The future's important
Boy I'm ten times better than Supastition on "7 Years..."
Visibly, you disagree, you must have Helen Keller ears
I'm heavy, I don't mean physically, I mean lyrically
And that's the reason why I keep on, cause now I feel reborn

[Chorus]
I feel incredible from head to toe
My mind's feeling better than you'll ever know
Cause I feel reborn (I'm feeling like a new man)
Back once again (Oh you thought it was over, I'm just starting)
I feel incredible from head to toe
My mind's feeling better than you'll ever know
Cause I feel reborn (And it's still Reform School)
Back once again (I ain't done)

[Kam Moye]
I've been face to face with death, placed in places that would torture most
Fortunate, the game support from Portland out to Portugal
Been blessed to be featured in the Chairman's Choice, The Source and so
Been humbled by poverty down to my last quarter bro
When record sales was horrible, some wouldn't support it bro
The ones who tried it couldn't find a local record store to go
Music's affordable, damn near free, it's portable
MP3 players to play in multitudes for the youth
Oh that's a poor excuse, think you above it kid?
My advice to pack your bags and find yourself another gig
You thinking you making paper in two-thousand-and-ten?
Two-thousand-and-eleven off of rap, bitch you out of here
Go swallow your pride and put some product in streets
The game is lacking in nutrients, they need some +Vitamin D+
Niggas ain't buying music here, why do you think that I'm overseas?
Cause those cats support the raw shit by far kid
This ain't candy-coated pantyhose and bras on the break
It's a grown man's own jam, spam can you relate?
If you hate, hell you better get ready for drama setting armageddon
Hit me with two hands like Obama taking Conga lessons
Look at me, I've gone aggressive, guess I'm still in detox
But you get the message, guess I better press the E-stop
I see people throwing up white flags yelling "please stop"
You lucky this time I don't keep on, I feel reborn

[Chorus]
I feel incredible from head to toe
My mind's feeling better than you'll ever know
Cause I feel reborn (It's like a breath of fresh air to me)
Back once again (I'm loving that, bring it back one more time)
I feel incredible from head to toe
My mind's feeling better than you'll ever know
Cause I feel reborn (Alright, that's enough for me)
Back once again</pre>
