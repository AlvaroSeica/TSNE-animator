[Chorus: C-Murder, B.G.]
Now all y'all done heard of me
now I'm C-Murder
I did done things y'all ain't never heard of
now I'm a fool boy, you call me a fool it's on
I'm willing to die for mine, I'm willing to die for mine

Now all y'all did heard of me
I'm B. Gizzle
I did done thing you bitch niggaz scared ta
I smacked bitches, shot niggaz
sold coke, caught cases, I've done it all
I ain't talking I don't stunt at all

[Verse 1: C-Murder]
You don't wanna mess with that glock boy (that glock boy)
test me with that glock you get popped boy (dropped boy)
on the spot money bustin on my socks boy (socks boy)
it's hot and now these cops on my jock boy (jock boy)
I breaks bread with these baseheads
I shows them love until they slip and I trip son
And speakin of drugs they wanna label me a killer
So don't push me life is hard
I'm trying to fill my own graveyard the 3rd Ward
I'm a menace to society like I'ma threat
Y'all ain't met the real C yet I'ma rep
Ask Bumby, Wayne and Rich about me it's realer than real
I was chosen when Slim got killed you know how I feels
it's a shame the reaper came who should I blame
Mytaius to me to be cool you know I'm a fool
messing with you guerillas we get your head bust (head bust)
me and my homies we about that the paper (the paper)
it's money we after Straight money niggaz
the cut boys could never be no fakers
I spit that gangster rap forget that hip hop
I bought them gangster-ass beats that make your head bop (head bop)
Then make that arm cock (arm cock) and then that show stops (stops)
cause it's murda murda murda murda
the 187 cause I don't give a.. but they don't heard me though

[Chorus: C-Murder, B.G.]
Now all y'all done heard of me
now I'm C-Murder
I did done things y'all ain't never heard of
now I'm a fool boy, you call me a fool it's on
I'm willing to die for mine, I'm willing to die for mine

Now all y'all did heard of me
I'm B. Gizzle
I did done thing you bitch niggaz scared ta
I smacked bitches, shot niggaz
Sold coke, caught cases, I've done it all
I ain't talking I don't stunt at all

[Verse 2: B.G.]
If you don't know me ask somebody you know and I bet they know
This lil nigga quick to draw down and split ya or cut ya throat
This lil nigga quick to handle his business and quick to creep
This lil nigga ain't bout coppin no play or squashin no beef
This lil nigga keep a 40 up on him wit an extension
This lil nigga'll steal ya even when ya payin attention
I'ma uptown gangsta, V.L. don
when I die bury me wit ya bo's and a t-shirt on
I'm a fool like that I be walkin through the hood (hood)
Wit all my jewelry on bitch niggaz wonder how I do it (do it)
I'm real that how I could it gets no realer
I got killas like jarnel just waitin for me to spend 'em
I was raised with gorillas and gangsters
Killers and thugs straight hustlers that'll touch you up
These choppers sendin niggaz all true to the game
You hear C or B.G. and ya gotta know them names

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
