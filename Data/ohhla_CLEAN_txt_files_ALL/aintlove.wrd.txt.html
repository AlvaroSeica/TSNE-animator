(*talking*)
Whoo, listen here mayn
This one here, is for the haters
Understand this here daddy

[Hook]
(Ain't no love), never have never will be
I'm still on the grind, still out for mine and I'm still me
(Ain't no love), that's just how it is
Sometimes you really gotta handle your bis

[Chris Ward]
With so much drama, in the YSP
It's kinda hard, being C. W-A-R-D
But I, somehow some way
Keep coming up with funky ass shit, like every single day
With more flows than the average, I'm on my toes
With mo' clothes and mo' hoes, and it shows I'm not your average
If I see it I just grab it, that's if I want it
Or I need it, or I just got that feel I gotta have it
Good pussy I'ma stab it, hop up on it
Hop up in it, hop all around it just like a rabbit
It's really a babbit, if you from H-Town
You cop it you drop it, you swing it and you slab it
Ooh-wee dag nabbit, I'm too fresh with my playerness
Some say I got, what the rest of these playas missed
That's why, I fuck the women that they wanna fuck
Or at least fuck the ones, that tell em they don't wanna fuck cause

[Hook]
(Ain't no love), never have never will be
I'm still on the grind, still out for mine and I'm still me
(Ain't no love), ain't no love at all
I'm just running with my niggaz, that love to ball

(*talking*)
I tell ya (ain't no love)
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Ain't no love, motherfucker listen nigga
(Ain't no love), never have never will be
I'm still on the grind, still out for mine and I'm still me
Yeah, ha-ha (hey, hey, hey)</pre>
