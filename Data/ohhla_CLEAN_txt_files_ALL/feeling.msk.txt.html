Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Solo un fragmento de mi vida fuiste tu
That I loved you in my life is something that I thought you knew
But I guess it slipped your mind babe once upon a time
We were good kept it kool something every couple should
I know talvez no viste todo lo que tuve que hacer
Para tenerte junto a mi desde el amanecer
No one ever cheated and no one ever let you go
But u never paid attention u were always on the go
Ahora trato de entender porque te fuiste lejos
Pero tengo que olvidar cada uno de esos tiempos
Comienso a continuar con el resto de mi vida
Mientras sigo aqui tomando varias onzas de tequila
Tratando de olvidar porque me iziste mal
Porque gastaste asi mi tiempo entre tanta oscuridad
I was devoted to u mijo but you played with my heart
What do you say we start over baby from the start

[Chorus]
How could you throw me around and turn around and start to talk
I gave you everything you needed but you took the walk
Now I'm just here blazing cuz I'm crazy I'm trying to forget about you lady
How could you throw me around and act like you don't know wuts up
I gave you everything you needed but I got no love
Now I'm just here drinking cuz I'm crazy I'm trying to forget about my baby

[Mal Hablado]
Tomo este licor amargo
Para quitarme el dolor que yo cargo
Por dentro you know I feel that sorrow
Without you I don't think about tomorrow
Eres mi luna y mi estrella
En mis ojos tu eres la mas bella
There is no one else for me in this tierra
I'm just thinking about you puffing on that yerba
Lets talk baby about our problems
Love will find a way to solve them
Excuses for this mess mija I lost them
I just want you back so we can blossom
Gangsters will always need love
Understand baby I need to make a buck
Dont believe what them haters say about us
They just hating cuz we got true love

[Chorus]
How could you throw me around and turn around and start to talk
I gave you everything you needed but you took the walk
Now I'm just here blazing cuz I'm crazy I'm trying to forget about you lady
How could you throw me around and act like you don't know wuts up
I gave you everything you needed but I got no love
Now I'm just here drinking cuz I'm crazy I'm trying to forget about my baby

[Ms Krazie]
Why you trying to forget me boy
My life is on another trip
Trying to get you back but my pride gots a hold on it
Smile now cry later keep your head up to the source
Wondering what you doing without me it breaks my heart
See es algo muy dificil de poderte explicar
Pero tengo que decirlo ven vamos a platicar
Y escucharas las miles cosas que an pasado por mi mente
Me and you belong together rest lo que dice la gente

[Mal Hablado]
Olvidarte mija creo que nunca lo pueda
Sin ti en esta vida nada me queda
When I'm not around you I wanna be with you
Talking to you and kissing you
Tell you that I love you till the day I'm gone baby
That I wanna start fresh forget being shaddy
Fresh new start mija so maybe forever and a day you can be my lady

[Chorus]
How could you throw me around and turn around and start to talk
I gave you everything you needed but you took the walk
Now I'm just here blazing cuz I'm crazy I'm trying to forget about you lady
How could you throw me around and act like you don't know wuts up
I gave you everything you needed but I got no love
Now I'm just here drinking cuz I'm crazy I'm trying to forget about my baby</pre>
