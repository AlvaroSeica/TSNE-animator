[Chorus]
I'll be on your side whenever it's time
But I'm no superman!
Naw...
See that ain't my name and I'll be damned if I make that claim, Oh Superman!
You won't find him over here y'all
I ain't the answer to your prayers y'all
Oh superman!
Naw!
That ain't how I swing!
I'm a regular cat doing my thing!
Oh superman!

Please!
Give me room, let me breath!
All my
Want to see me on my knees!
They want to see me flat out on my back
Cause every word I spit is true and got 'em looking wac!
Just cause I'm jumping over buildings
Saving little children
With no rocket nap sack
Just me and my back pack
Don't mean that I'm really a Super civilian
X that yo back track quick
I'm just a rap cat!

[Chorus]

I land back on the blocks!
Crotch popping out my pants like Jack in the Box! (Boing!)
I can't help it cause my pants are so tight
I grabbed the wrong pair, of Wonder Woman's last night!
When I seen my sign shine
I fleed to the scene and realized it's not mine!
Damn y'all!
I should toss out the bong and move like a doctor on call
See I'll be there but my car might stall, I thought I told y'all???!!

[Chorus]

Look up in the sky yo, it be a fly bro
I'm usually high cause I'm usually puffing HY-dro!
Don't call me superman; nah, I ain't with that!
Just because chickens be rubbing on my six pack!
Hand on my nuts while I fly across the world
Damaging guts
That's how I'm gonna toss your girl
Haters wanna clap me up!
Smack me up!
Just cause I got a little power
People what the fuck!

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
