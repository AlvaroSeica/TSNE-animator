Paul wall..chick magnet in stores
me and mick jones we the future baby
we comin' soon...its the swishahouse
straight to da room

I'm lookin' for a fine little freak wit class
slim waste and pretty face wit a whole lotta ass
a little sasy not too concern wit gosip
you goin' be alright, long as you don't reach for my wallet
I wanta chick this lick wit some nice round tits
get her full of grapejuice and milk and she's ready to lick
I like them slim wit curves and ready to serve
I gotta way wit words that make them be ready like hors d'oeuvres
when my mackin' them birds I poke em' like spers
I stick my plug in there socket and I give them a power surge
I can make you feel high without fields of smoke
when its over you can't move like your back's been broke
I'm the captain of the drill team the moralrean brothers
I like them all shapes all types all colors
I'm double dutch on bummpers from these late night hights
I'm somethin' simular to a plumer I be layin' the pipe
I make you feel it in they stomach and they float like a feather
smooth is eva I break off orgasmic pleasure
bring them to Mu-Shu fellas, who you tag teamin'
baptizin' wit ceemin' exercisin' them with demons
I go by the name of paul wall I'm the chick magnet
you can call me UPS cuz I deliver the package
alot of practice and sex, 4 days in a week
a got a hell of a resume for makin' ladies knees weak
soon as I spit, I make them shake and quiver
my swav dip in their tone make them wet like a river
I always home run in bat, I don't strike out
they like some ships lost a sea and I'm the lighthouse
we the lights out and the music's on my resume is well known
paul wall and mike jones we bring it straight to da room its on

[voice]
I lose all control when you grab a hold
and you do your trick I love it with you...Lick!...Lick!
you got lock at me every part of me no what makes me tick
I love it when you Lick!</pre>
