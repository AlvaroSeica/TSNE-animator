[Verse 1]
I had me a shorty that I liked, face real cute, body real tight
Fat, fat ass, breasts so nice, waistline small, just my type
We hung out like maybe once or twice
my man hooked me up and he said she was right
"she don't really get down on the 1st night
but she loves how you rap so homie anything can happen"
tucked my chain in quick, so she don't think I'm a trick
We was Facebook friends, everyday she talkin' slick
so when she was in my ear, I'm feeling on her hips
said she wanna take me home just to chill a little bit
so I went there, bout 10 minutes later, shorty went there
she said "Sha make me famous"
I was in the chair, she knelt down like a proposal
next thing I know, she had me exposed
taking off her clothes, damn near naked
she went down hard, said she liked how I tasted
soon as she was finished, she tried to jump in my face
but she tried to sit on it, I said shorty just wait

[Chorus]
How do you tell, a pretty young lady that her coochie smells?
Haaaay
maybe you play this joint, and maybe she'll get the point

[Verse 2]
I said I gotta pee, I really had to flee
I caught a big whif and I almost couldn't see
It smelled like something from the bottom of the sea
with perfume sprayed on it and sprinkled with cheddar cheese
If she took a shower, how could she miss that?
and if she did wash it, well the smell came back
I touched it with my hand to make sure it was the cat
I smelled my finger and I fell on my back
this don't match, she's so fine
maybe she just finished her cycle and that's why
Maybe it's yeast, maybe it's me
maybe it's not that bad, let me see
I sniffed one more time and just put my clothes on
I said I'm really sorry, I feel so wrong but
my girl keeps calling, I mean, I got studio
I mean I got a meeting, I mean, I can't do it yo
She smelled putrid, sorta like the juice
from the trucks with the garbage I was feeling so stupid
'cause I couldn't say it, damn I couldn't tell her
and sometimes in the back of my mind I still smell her damn!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I don't know if it's your panties, you need to wear cottons
but something's goin' on got your box smelling rotten
maybe you ain't wiping too good, you gotta watch it
smells like you hiding a rodent inside your crotch
it could be your jeans, maybe they too tight
might be something you eating that ain't right
fast food, hormones, enzymes, something
you gotta be careful with what you put in your stomach
might be the rubbers or the dudes that you touching
but when I inhale it, my man can't function
shit kinda sour, it's like you got the power
to smell up a whole room it's beyond baby powder
Febreze won't help, for me to continue
I'd have to throw a fuckin Glade plug-in in you
and then you want somebody eat your sht too
I'd rather eat cow ass, babygirl I'll pass!</pre>
