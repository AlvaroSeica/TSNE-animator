Say mayn you know who it is, and yeah you know what I do 
Oh yeah you know where I'm from, and just how I'm coming through 
You know it's R.I.P. to the Pimp, and also for Screw  
For Moe, Pat, H.A.W.K., Steve, Gator and Mello too 
Oh yeah this H-Town baby, you already know 
Boys steady bang steady blow, and they steady po' 
Now we done told em befo', and we done showed em befo' 
But I'ma put it out there again, so you know from the do' 
In them 2011 J's, 2011 cars 
Putting the cameras, on these 2011 stars 
Making it crystal clear, so it's no confusion 
There's no substitution, cause we repping for Houston  
Now some call it Two-ston, and some Clutch City  
Where the cars and the women, look so damn pretty  
Oh yeah you hear me, it's going down here  
And if you ain't down with it, then don't you come around here  
  
[Hook]  
(Uh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys)  
Coming down in candy toys, smoking big talking noise  
(uh), Mississippi Lousiana  
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia and Alabama  
Rep your block rep your set, let me know it's all good  
And if you don't bang, just represent your hood  
Say I wish a nigga would, wish-wish a nigga would  
Wish a nigga would, I wish-wish a nigga would  
  
[E.S.G.]  
We on the way playground, the purple and green paper  
Home of independent bosses, Lil' J's and Tony Drapers  
Bun B's and Pimp C's, Slim Thee's and E.S.G.'s 
Ducking F-E-D's, come with quarter G's Drew Brees  
Fo's trees, be teasy kush fo' the trill  
Peyton Manning with the canon, I can hit the whole field 
Trunk popping like pills, we big Benz silly boppers  
I'm good with the chopper, and I ain't talking helicopters  
Blocka-blocka, it's over you dead  
You a fo' power line flow, I'm over the head 
Candy blue black or red, you can tell when I come  
The big three and I don't mean Dwyane, Bosh and Lebron huh 
  
(*talking*)  
This how it go down, cause we stay bringing heat  
Know I'm tal'n bout, three bosses getting it in  
Yeah I was born in the Boot, but I moved to the H  
Cause the prices cheaper, so get with me g'eah  
  
[Hook]  
(Uh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys)  
Coming down in candy toys, smoking big talking noise  
(uh), Oklahoma Carolinas  
Can't forget Tennessee, yeah the whole South behind us  
Rep your block rep your set, let me know it's all good  
And if you don't bang, just represent your hood  
Say I wish a nigga would, wish-wish a nigga would  
Wish a nigga would, I wish-wish a nigga would  
  
[Slim Thug]  
H-Town Texas, candy cars and bar 
Neighborhood superstars, and plenty fine broads  
Southside stay stunting, riding red turning heads 
Northside still blue, boys ducking them FED's  
Ery'body bout bread, trap stars grinding  
24-7, that's why ery'body shining  
Johnny got boys blinding, jewels is a fool  
Riding round with the tool, if you snooze you lose 
Paid dues in the House, nowadays days I'm the boss 
Me and E still stunting, breaking boys off 
Been getting to the money, over ten years strong  
And they wanna know why, Thugga paper so long  
Grown man swag, when I'm popping bitch ass  
I chopped off the braids, but my bitches ain't mad  
In a million dollar pad, yellow bitch acting bad  
Go down in H-Town, we bout that cash Thugga 
  
[Hook] 
(Uh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys)  
Coming down in candy toys, smoking big talking noise  
(uh), New York to L.A. 
Detroit, Chi-Town, Arizona, V.A. 
Rep your block rep your set, let me know it's all good  
And if you don't bang, just represent your hood  
Say I wish a nigga would, wish-wish a nigga would  
Wish a nigga would, I wish-wish a nigga would
