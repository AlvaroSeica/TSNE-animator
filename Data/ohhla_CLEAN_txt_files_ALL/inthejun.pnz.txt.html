Chorus: Fingazz
We're in the jungle
We livin' do or die
But we do what we do to survive
We're in the jungle
Where it's eye for an eye
And the bullets rain down from the sky
We're in the jungle
We livin' do or die
But we do what we do to survive
We're in the jungle
Where it's eye for an eye
And the bullets rain down from the sky
Cause we're in the jungle

[Verse 1: Psalmz]
Survive was the plan in the land where I'm from
One hand on the Bible, other hand on the gun
Keep an eye on your Bible cause the damage is done
When you sleep and the scavengers come, see I'm from
New York in the eastern section
For the police
Even need police protection, but no matter
Where you go, it's the same song, tryin' to get your name known
You got a better shot if they ain't leavin' somebody's brain blown
Fuck it, but it breathes through the ceiling, raisin' to kill
It feels where I'm trapped between angels and demons
So
I don't sleep or wink, remember the evil sinks
In everyone's mind sometimes, so fuck what the people
Think
They rather see me dyin'
Than to see me climbin'
From the ashes like the pheonix flyin'
So
Lord, hear me clearly, please spare me
So what don't kill me don't scare me
Feel me

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: IzReal]
My one liners turn men to mindless, no stunt dummies
No green screens behind us
You don't have to
Look too hard, two stars feed bars
To see they ain't readin' no cue cards
So what's the hurry for (Hurry for)
Or the weary for (Weary for)
When you very soft (Very soft)
Like Terry Cloft (Terry Cloft)
Small cookies don't crumble, I
Will serve them
A slice of the humble pie
The jungle's
High in danger, need no science major
To know my iron's my lion tamer
Up against the upper class (Upper class)
Bet a hundred cash (Hundred cash)
I would turn your face to a punching bag
Ain't those rappers is talkin' in rhythm
Couldn't walk in the game without walkin' it with 'em
Without knowin' or showin' what the ghetto's like
Through a rebel's life where Christ and the Devil fight

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Ark]
Do you know why they call it the jungle?
Cause when pigs got you cornered
There's no where to run to
And you won't see the snake
But just know what's among you
If you tryin' to be an ape
You gotta climb from the struggle
And the fire escape
Is your vine in the pinch, and the lines lie
Wait, tryin' to eye, when you blink, you got swine
At your base, and he's eyin' on you chimps, cause them got 'em
On your case, and he's dyin' to find Prince, so you leave
All your tracks clean
But your loco crack fiend
Is a (???) gossips without have and had seen
Lions and cheetahs or tigers and zeebras
Run wild like they cheaters, they rely in the weaker
To never put a fight up
And every night, we light up
A peace pipe in hope peace finds us
But greed blind us
So we become bats in the cave
Cause somehow, this jungle got us trapped in the cage

Repeat Chorus

[Fingazz]
Cause we're in the jungle (Jungle...)
Cause we're in the jungle (Jungle...)
Cause we're in the jungle (Jungle...)
Cause we're in the jungle (Jungle...)</pre>
