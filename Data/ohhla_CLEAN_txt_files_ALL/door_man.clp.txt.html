[Pusha T] [Chorus]
Hey doorman!! 
Tell em line up the Cris..
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch..
You niggaz keep waving them wrists
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch..
Ye ain't got money like this
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch
So scream it if ya ambition fit
I put my money on the roof and crush this bitch

Sing it
niggaz, Lalalalalalalalalalaaaaa..
Ye ain't got money like this, Lalalalalalalalalalaaaaa..
Paper plates on a brand new Six, Lalalalalalalalalalaaaaa..
I just taught my young boys how to mix, Lalalalalalalalalalaaaaa
Ye ain't seen paper like this nigga..

[Pusha T]
Every All-Star, every Cancun, every holiday South Beach in full bloom..
Thousand dollar suites white sheets, white rooms..
I got a bright future neck like a full moon..
Buy what we want, spend what they want..
Young, rich, hot nigga, everything she wants..
Triple beams scales got me under deep spells..
Kiss my forehead, momma knows I mean well..
Cocaine bought me everything I ever had..
And I aint never been scared to spend my very last..
Cause I can get it back, watch me get it back..
Last 2 o 10 bricks, shit I'm cooking that..

[Chorus]

[Malice]
My life's too real to be a PSA
The million in the ceiling is for a rainy day
I cut it than whip her like she Annie Mae
Praise God I escaped by his amazing grace..
Nah, never was I saving Face, some family
ties are impossible to break
The almighty judge only he can save me
Don't cry for us now just pray for our babies
Mercedes 5 with the open roof
Miami Hot Rods in the ocean view
The tell tale signs that expose the truth
Lil Willy Rat King this one's for you..

[Chorus]

[Malice]
We get it in a flash like paparazzi
Cars, crib, everything big body
Big charm, hanging from my big chain
Swing side to side feeling like I'm T-Pain
Pull up to the crib bitch think she seeing thangs
Make a hundred stacks blow it like it's pocket change..

[Pusha T]
If the good die young, than the greats go to jail
I miss my Tony
hope you snitches burn in hell
Kiss and tell with sales on us ballers
All because them two doors coming with big spoilers
All because them bitches is acting like they jaw-less
And we don't count money we weigh it like fish orders

[Chorus]</pre>
