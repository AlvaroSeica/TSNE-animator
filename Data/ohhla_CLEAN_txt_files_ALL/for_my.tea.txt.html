[Intro: Dom Pachino]
I see you out there, what up, son, yo, aiyo

[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino]
This is for my people, that just came home
And my niggas on the block, that be hustling strong
To all my fallen soldiers, your name lives on
Straight from the heart, you know the words to this song

[Dom Pachino]
Hold your head, son, you be out in a sec
And when you get out, you'll be cashing a check
When they let you off the bus, I'll throw a chain on your neck
Give you the keys to the six, and some trees for your head
When you're locked up, you feel like you dead, but you still living
And I still got your back, you my brother
It's more than just rap, this time let them young niggas carry the gat
You put too much work in, to be dealing with that
We running the business, and we can't afford that
Stick my lawyers on that, ya'll thugs on pay roll
When you making bread, you gotta spread the mayo
Once the shit got hot, I'm O.T. on lay low
Shit I spit like lava, fresh out the volcano
Record exec's think that I'm anal
But my cash be flowing in the drop like the draino
Sometimes I even think I'm insane, though
Rest in peace to the God, Wise, forever I love you

[Chorus 2X]

[Crunch Lo]
For my niggas up north who got caught and tossed in the mountains
We try to survive in New York City housing
We drowning with bad dreams, make it by any means
Hustling to them fiends, our lives be on the line
Tryin' to make a spare dime, you know a nigga wanna shine
But the cost to pay, hold the weight on my shoulder
I wanted you better, rocked my brother leather
And just for the caution, I carry a nine beretta
It's like whatever, the weather holds, I never fold
I'm untold to the death of us, and I rep for us
And our babies, to see for old ladies
Make us go crazy, but maybe one day
Things shall change to a positive, ya'll hear my crimes
It's like a nigga gotta live

[NLZ]
I ain't seen you in a stretch, like twelve long years
I got, love understanding, why I shed those tears
Ah God, pardon me, still you a part of my heart
Do time, we grew apart, blow them things in the dark
I see you old now, seeing that you all grown up
I take a ride through the hood, in my Cadillac track
Here's a stack for your pocket, kid, enjoy your life
I got, mommy wanna holla and the body is tight
Get your mind right, we can get paper and eat
I take a lost off the streets, and seen you carry the heat
I know you feel incomplete, I got your back, for sure
Take your time, do it right, cuz we bound to blow

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
