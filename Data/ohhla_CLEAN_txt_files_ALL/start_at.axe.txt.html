Song:   Start at the End
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Long Axe]
We fear, we love, we under the bridge with trust
We laugh, we cry, we live and we die, we bye
We sell, we steal, we shooting to kill, we heal
We help, we push, we burning in hell with Bush
We hot, we cold, we young and we old with soul
We dads, we moms, we children in open arms
We search, we find, we locked up and doing time
We drink, we eat, we hug and we meet, say peace
We run, we fall, we fly when we go to the mall
We black, we brown, the offense of ups and downs
We kings, we queens, we do what we do for dreams
We here, we gone, we start at the end of the song

[Chorus: Long Axe]
We start at the end of the song
We start at the end of the song
We start at the end of the song
We start at the end of the song

[Long Axe]
We fear, we love, we under the bridge with trust
We laugh, we cry, we live and we die, we bye
We sell, we steal, we shooting to kill, we heal
We help, we push, we burning in hell with Bush
We hot, we cold, we young and we old with soul
We dads, we moms, we children in open arms
We search, we find, we locked up and doing time
We drink, we eat, we hug and we meet, say peace
We run, we fall, we fly when we go to the mall
We black, we brown, the offense of ups and downs
We kings, we queens, we do what we do for dreams
We here, we gone, we start at the end of the song
