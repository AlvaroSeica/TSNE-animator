[Jermaine Dupri - echoing]
This is a, So So Def, world premier
A world, premier
So So Def, world premier

[Da Brat: repeat 2X]
Brat back, once again it's on
Still smokin in this bitch, call me Cheech &amp; Chong

[Jermaine over second repeat]
They want that Fab 5 Freddy shawty
Let it go~!

[Chorus 2X: Da Brat]
I got that good shit, y'all bitches sellin dirt
I got 'em comin at me all up out the woodwork
They want that Beat Street, that straight Rock Steady
That real rap shit, Fab 5 Freddy yo

[Da Brat]
2011, 199fo'
I've been here since 17 years ago
Longevity, rock like a rolling stone
The pink graf diamond clarity, a rarity
I'm home, please don't go comparin me or sharin
my name in some petty-ass bullshit I ain't never been
on, since the first hit, most got addicted
to the method of me, methamphetamine

[Chorus]

[Da Brat]
Poppin strawberry in the hookah
You could, not even do what I used ta
I'm the past, present, AND future; even if you was mustard
you couldn't ketchup, get you a booster - chair
Grown folk here, dare not challenge my greatness
Attempt to - lose! Realness vs. fakeness
Go on ahead, free yourself, Fantasia
Let it go, Teddy Pendergrass, Brat major

[Chorus]</pre>
