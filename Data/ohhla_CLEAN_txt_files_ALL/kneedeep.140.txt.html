[Intro: Shawn Wigs]
Son, it was the illest fucking thing I ever--
The ill--, I ever went through in my life, man

[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, it was an ill story, son, knee deep in some ass
The door kicked in, with sounds of gun blasts
Made my dick go limp, reached for the ratchet, caught a cramp muscle spasm
Squeezed off five like the Jacksons
Move from here, boxers around my feet
Found myself stuck in the middle of the street
Holding the heat, police tried to move like fleet
I stay sweet, dipping through the blocks
In my wife beater, doo-rag and Fubu sport socks
Made a move, nigga had nothing to prove
Left the jewels, one minute 'fore I hit that dude
Shit is real, burnt my leg from hot lugers
Seen Lounge ("What up Doo-La"), niggas tried to clap me
Spit fire at me, jump in the whip, stashed the Heat like Miami
He had don-dons, four thirty
The Benz truck, what the fuck
That's when the windows got bucked, dog got struck
By the all black out, fed Cadillac truck
So I dipped out the back, grabbed the heat from the stash
Tore ass, ran fast... </pre>
