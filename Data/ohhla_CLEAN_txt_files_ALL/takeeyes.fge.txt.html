[CHORUS 1]
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off of you.
You'd be like heaven to touch. I wanna
hold you so much. At long last love has 
arrived. And I thank God I'm alive. You're
just too good to be true. Can't take my
eyes off of yoy.

Pardon the way that I stare. There's nothing 
else to compare. The sight of you leaves me 
weak. There are no words left to speak.
But if you feel like I feel. Please let me know
that it's real. You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off of you.

[CHORUS 2]
I need you baby, and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm a lonely night. I love
you baby. Trust in me when I say: Oh pretty 
baby, don't bring me down I pray. Oh pretty
baby, now that I found you, stay. And let me 
love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby....

Repeat Chorus 1
[To fade]
I need you baby, and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm a lonely night. I love
you baby. Trust in me when I say: Oh pretty
baby, don't bring me down I pray. Oh pretty
baby, now that I found you, stay. And let me 
love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby....

I need you baby, and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm a lonely night. I love
you baby. Trust in me when I say: Oh pretty
baby, don't bring me down I pray. Oh pretty
baby, now that I found you, stay. And let me 
love you, oh baby let me love you, oh baby....</pre>
