[Chorus: Fundisha]
Have you eva eva eva in your whole whole life
Seen the the things that I've seen or live the life
People don't know what I go through
Or imagine what it's like growing up in the hood
Have you eva eva eva in your whole whole life
Seen the things that I've seen or live the life
People don't know what I go through
Or imagine what it's like being misunderstood

[Apocalipps]
Ayo, Somebody please explain this life that we live in
Money power and women, And just to get large the price is the prison
Convicts come home vindictive, And unforgiven
And to society its like the dead has arisen
They just let me out, I'm tryna reach for the stars
Got forty dollars to my name, Now its just me against the odds
I got a whole lotta shit to face
I gotta stay in the shelter until I find a job and get my own place
And all that cake that I got in the past, It means nothing
Damn, Life is hard but it don't come with instructions
But I stay strong, The result peep this
Your boy Lipps and Fundisha, The live your life remix

[Fundisha]
Maybe, If you could walk a mile in my shoes
You would feel all the things that I go through
And then you tell me what you would do
To try and make your dreams come true
When you, Feel like your back is up against the wall
And every time you try to rise you fall
But yet you find the strength to hold on
Keep the faith despite it all

[Chorus]

[Fundisha]
Have you, Ever walked outside scared you might lose your life
Don't know if you'll live to see twenty-nine
Can't even be a kid, You have to be a man in order to stand
Ohh oh, But I, Got bigger dreams inside of my head
Don't wanna end up the next one dead
So I pray everyday for a better way, Help me lord Hey

[Chorus: First 4 Lines]

[Apocalipps]
Hey yo way till they get a load of me
Apocalipps, I spent chips and talk shit and fuck hoes for free
I flow for cheese, But I feel like I'm a mice in the trap
I'm John Wooly with a Rugy, I'm nice with gats
Despite the fact, I creep like TLC's second album
I'll be pissy drunk lettin off with the pump from the tower
Now look at you cowards, To think what's yours could be ours
You'll find your whole family dead within a couple of hours
My home town is full of regulators, Gladiators
Real niggas that always hold heat like radiators
We'll stick ya ballas up for your Hercs and ya Alligator
Screw drive your steering column, Then murk your navigator

[Fundisha]
Ohhh, Imagine growing up, Dead bodies showing up
Hood dreams, But nobody blowin up
One out of two barely make it, Half incarcerated
My life I wouldn't trade it
Not for the love or the money money, Uhh
Don't try and play me for a dummy dummy, What
Dreams must be taller then these project walls
I trust in God that's why I never fall

[Chorus X2 w/ Fundisha ad-libs]</pre>
