(Gotta be
got to be a freak of the week)

[ VERSE 1: Breeze ]
What you think about steppin to a funky beat that's movin ya
And while I'm doin ya, I'm also provin ta
Many I'm swingin and bringin you new styles to speak on
Muff, kick the beat on, you can't stop the freak on
This subject made public on human nature
Scribbled down on paper so I can relate ta
Ya some instruction on how to rap a freak
Free seminar, so grab a pen and a sheet
First ( ? ) you know tactful ways of gathering
Tell her what I'm havin, then I start reachin
For the oven, a symbol above em, to love them
So there'll be no pull-out when I'm freakin
A constant fall of ( ? )
It's many but the speed may vary
You know what I want before I speak
But let me ask you a question: do you wanna get freaked?

[ VERSE 2: Breeze ]
While a freak is at a constant hang you remember
I'm not the brother you thought I was pretending to be tender
It's only right that we do what we should do
Go with the flow with a freak, you know you want to
Far from a gigolo but figure though I'm dope'n
Never catch me sleepin cause I keep one eye open
Your legs are closed and you're froze from hesitation
I'm known to bust through in a tight situation
Everything is raw, nothing violent as hardcore
All I want is to just tour your body and explore
New reachings of excitement just to play around with
Somethin to hold on and this is the sound if
My muscles tighten up and I flow like a faucet
I don't hold it, I just look for a place to toss it
You look to the side, what's the  matter, you can't speak?
Now answer me a question: do you wanna get freaked?

Yo, speakin of the freak scene
I got my man Big Dad in the house
(Yeah)
And he seems to be a little bit of a freak himself
(Sometimes)
At least that's what he claims
Always claimin...
Yo man, why don't you explain it - in detail

[ VERSE 3: Big Dad ]
This is another freak method, among others
( ? ) some shit he didn't cover
Let's go deeper in depth and detail, cause when he fails
To let you know it's either yes or no
I ain't got time to be beggin or askin for your leggin
Either I'm in with the skins cause if not, yo, I'm jettin
Cause your denial ain't jack to me
Cause there's a million other damsels that'll rap to D
I'm like a smooth operator and I operate - smooth
Straight to the point, I wanna grip your hips and move
Don't fight the feeling and don't disturb the groove
Cause I intend to attend your needs and soothe
I'm like an aphrodisiac, so remember that
When you're doin what I'm thinkin of till when it's that
Time for the sation to cease, the drawers to drop
You hop to cop a squat cause it can't be stopped

Yeah, can't be stopped, you know what I'm sayin?
Me and the Breeze can't be stopped on that freaky-deaky tip, you know
Freaky-deak, freaky-deak</pre>
