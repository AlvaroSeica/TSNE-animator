Typed by: AZ Lyrics

No doubt I'm in it to win it
Been makin moves since the womb
Solar strut, King Tut out the tomb
Hot begoons, try to pin me up to the boards
But I check the city thoughts on the album like George
Metropolis, no stoppin this, rock rockin this, pop lockin this like Benzil
Or that kid dat porensol use to chill with so dead as a misfit
Grip, the microphone I'm too legit to quit
I bit my style from angels on the night shift
Like who shines so dope but still gives
It just becomes a curse when evil height gets
Into the mental path, use to be arts and crafts now its shots and graphs
Math-matical, man's such a pity
When you switch up your dity, try to fool Gotham city

Is you with me, is you with me
Its fly or die so get live tonight
Can you feel the sick run the city?

Is you with me, is you with me
I said its fly or die so get live tonight
Or show love to your Gotham city

L.J.

Three boys in a car coastin
Three girls on the stars postin
Theres just one king and he don't wear wings
So lets stop the braggin and bostin

Its like
Three boys in a car coastin
Three girls on the stars postin
Theres just one king and he don't wear wings
So lets stop the braggin and bostin</pre>
