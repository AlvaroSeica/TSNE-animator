[Hook: Allah Real]
It's time for a nigga to stand up, stand up
Time for you, to man up
It's time for a nigga to stand up, stand up
Brooklyn Zu, man up

[Intro: Shorty Shitstain]
Yeah... word up...
Word up... yeah... yo... yo, yo, yo

[Shorty Shitstain]
I keep my eyes open, and my ear to the street
I guess they ain't know it was me
I come straight from the bottom of the barrel
Niggas won't change my channel, I love my piano
I love my piano, I travel through state to state
Me and my platinum tongue, niggas ya'll can't hold no weight
Where they get them rhymes from, where they get them style from
I'mma shine like a tommy gun
And I'mma shine for my niggas in the pen
My niggas that's not coming home, never never never ever again
And I'mma shine for my niggas on the street
My niggas that be hustling, trying to make ends meet
I was born in Brooklyn, raised by the Bronx
The Bronx niggas show me how to stomp the slum
I used to travel back and forth on the 4 train wit my birth 38
But a skill will bust you, man
All money's not good money, and niggas act funny
When they get a little bit of money
I said, all money's not good money, and niggas act funny
When they get a little bit of money

[Chorus: LaFonda]
We looking for a better way, got so many things to say
Thank God for another day, oh yeah
We do it for the money, but we do it for the block
Put your hands in the air, if you love hip hop
We looking for a better way, got so many things to say
Thank God for another day, oh yeah
We do it for the money, but we do it for the block
Put your hands in the air, Brooklyn Zu don't stop

[Free Murda]
Beretta tested gun, be the first, aye, bore
You better Jetson, like your first name George
Duke wanna catch one, watch the herse wait for him
Now you'se a dead man, no more birthdays for him
This beat got me on my dumb luck, forty cal's on my waist
Always keep one tucked, shorty's wild in the place
Bout to get son touched, want it, blaow in your face
Now that ass fucked up, fuck they gon' tell me
Bring back my nigga Velli or my nigga Jeff Row
Bust one in your skelly, plus one in your belly
Let a shot go for E.J., this my nigga P.J.
Why she had to leave me, uzi keep that tizzy
Blizzard always keep it gritty, damn a nigga
Hit me tight like a pair of liggys
Dare a nigga hit me, like I'm dead, I'm gon' miss me
I'm something like the bear, Murda, always on his grizzly

[Willy Gleamz]
Yo, no more games, the streets want the prophet
The streets want the logic, wit the heat of a rocket
The beats only knocking like an 808, can't stop the fade away
The handle just a sample how I play the game
Niggas is acting like William Shatner
Talking in they shirts like Spock, where's my backup?
Hurry up and get me, 'fore these niggas have me clapped up
A storm captive, where you gotta scoop me wit a spatula
New York swagger jagger, ice on the gear ship
Goons wit the dagger, grab the knife, you won't tear shit
Ox real quiet, but the SK boom
You'll meet Alice scrambling when you reach that moon
Subsequently I'm a genius, my thesis parallel to the great
Minds of time, run it by yours, parapelegic
Gleamz wrote the manual, I guess how I'm eating
These muthafuckas wit flows, makes me a cannibal

[Chorus]

[60 Second Assassin]
The black kiss of death, tongue, flips the fury, blind drips the jury
Egypt, my mind raised from out the attic, Asia iced out
With mad flavors, onyx, rubies, voices that sound supersonic waves, this is a
flurry
Visions are blurry, welcome to terror dome, I be head all
Hell on the throne, find you through a chip in your poem
Link in your bones, certain stolen cosmos from underground zones
Fake pharaohs posing, but yet, my road is narrow
Hot as Sahara, cross the hot Arabian, I vision Satan
Versus Asian men, triangiling within the square
Of Abraham, challenging man made men
Rappers see you acting, or whoever claim they climb the ladder
When your mind don't see over the matter, see me in mediation
In green pastures, a perfect master, sir
Excellent in his chapter, rapture
I watch you catch falls like Niagara

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Popa Wu]
Yeah, ladies and gentleman, this is another one for ya'll
Another Zu banger, zoology in your mind
I'mma give you all the jewels of life
Wit knowledge, wisdom, understanding
Culture, freedom, power, refinement
Equality, God, build or destroy bond
And I want everybody to be peace in they cipher
Remember, if you don't know where you came from
You're not gonna make it where you going, Zu, we out

[Hook]
