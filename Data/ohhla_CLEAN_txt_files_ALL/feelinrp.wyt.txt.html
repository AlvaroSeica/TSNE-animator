(Hook, Project Pat)
In the hood, stackin' funds (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Purple kush in my lungs (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Got karats in the charm (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Feelin' real pimpish, got me feelin' real pimpish
Big wheels on the ride (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Peanut-butter all inside (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Jealous when I ride by (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Feelin' real pimpish, got me feelin' real pimpish

(Verse 1, Lil Wyte)
I'm feelin' real damn pimpish, I'm blingin'
I'm high as a kite, I'm clean, I'm clean
Headed to the club tonight
If I see ya, ya know I'ma dip down and holla
As long as it don't slow up my dollars
I'ma fall back, way back, deep in V.I.P
Where the club owner told us it was cool to smoke weed
Black lights, neon lights, all they see is the charm
We strapped, we strapped, but we ain't out to cause harm
In the hood stackin' funds, peanut-butter in the ride
We ain't even worried bout the haters on the other side
I been feelin' real pimpish, since I stepped out the door
New shoes, new clothes, new cars and new 'Dro, whoa!

(Hook, Project Pat)
In the hood, stackin' funds (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Purple kush in my lungs (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Got karats in the charm (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Feelin' real pimpish, got me feelin' real pimpish
Big wheels on the ride (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Peanut-butter all inside (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Jealous when I ride by (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Feelin' real pimpish, got me feelin' real pimpish

(Verse 2, Lil Wyte)
Now I'm circlin' the Bay, bangin' (Feelin' real pimpish)
And I'm feelin' real pimpish, from this life that I'm livin'
I sit back and dream, and them bitches come true
If I can do this shit, tell my why can't you?
I'm a regular motherfucka, just like him or her
Him or they, another Southerner here to play
From the volunteer state, now officially on the roster
Memphis lad's has won the oscar, no more weight
Then lie nowhere, and personally I didn't win the oscar
But I still get all the perks the game has to fuckin' offer
New clothes, a lot of money, so I'm fresh as a lobster
I could do this all day, lay low and make a killin'
Project Pat, please tell these motherfucka's how I'm feelin'

(Hook, Project Pat)
In the hood, stackin' funds (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Purple kush in my lungs (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Got karats in the charm (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Feelin' real pimpish, got me feelin' real pimpish
Big wheels on the ride (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Peanut-butter all inside (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Jealous when I ride by (Got me feelin' real pimpish)
Feelin' real pimpish, got me feelin' real pimpish</pre>
