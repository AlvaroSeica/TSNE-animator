(Intro, Juicy J)
Project Pat
Ya boy Juicy J
You'll never be a G
You'll never be a G

(Hook, Project Pat)
I done sold them grams, robbed niggas for cash
I done bust that thumper on plenty niggas ass
Broke down plenty bales, so much clientele
Went to jail, would never tell, but some of you niggas will
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G

(Verse 1, Project Pat)
When I was young, had the chopper; Cock it
Project Pat was robbin
Like the Grinch bitch, takin shit; Fillin up my stocking
Stocking cap on my skull nigga, better wipe off that mug
Nigga like Pat don't give no fuck
Bustin that thumper screaming "Thug Life"
Like 2 Pac, went to jail and never ran it
Held it down for all my dogs, hustlers prayer oh my authentic
Pussy nigga, real acrobatic; Flippin on ya homie
I'm the state you don't bologna
I'm fifty karats, you the phony
Hit a lic, man for fifty yams; Took it off your ass
This the street, who you trustin fool?
Put that in the stash
Round my way, pull a move like that; No coming back
Just exchanged fifty rocks for fifty shots in your ass

(Hook, Project Pat)
I done sold them grams, robbed niggas for cash
I done bust that thumper on plenty niggas ass
Broke down plenty bales, so much clientele
Went to jail, would never tell, but some of you niggas will
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G

(verse 2, Juicy J)
Let me borrow your bitch... just for tonight
I'll get her so fucking high
You'll think she just caught a flight
She ride my dick like a bike
I tell her suck it, don't bite
And you still cuffing that ho, like you Miami Vice
Juicy J don't love these bitches
I just make love to these bitches
Then send 'em back to that same nigga that hug 'em and kiss 'em
I go to sleep with my money, I cuddle up with my dope
I wake up to that paper and then I go get some more
Fuck nigga, what'cha talkina bout? We don't talk it out
We yellow tape and white chalk it out
Live every day like a homerun
What I'm tryin'a say is we ball out
Your bedroom and your living room fit right inside my dog house
I'm searching hard for a fuck to give, but I'm sorry, looks like I'm all out

(Hook, Project Pat)
I done sold them grams, robbed niggas for cash
I done bust that thumper on plenty niggas ass
Broke down plenty bales, so much clientele
Went to jail, would never tell, but some of you niggas will
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G
Cause you'll never-ever-ever-ever-ever be a G</pre>
