Give it up
We gon' show
You how we party
Give it up

You how we party

(Verse 1)
[Magoo]
I fiend for all beats, like girls jump for tricks
Don't salt the next man, keep that Lindbergh hits
Up in the cut, like barbers and haircut
I'm black with indian, my race should be mutt
I cut with razor blades, play spades with Aunt Venus
Evaluate this rap, take heed a freakin' genius
Up in the sky, up high, don't puff lye
Do you smoke crack Sam, prepare, you gonna die
Bump Crazy Joe, my name is Crazy Flow
You thought I had eight, but I got ten more
Off beat and on beat, old school like Beat Street
I stink like pop's feet, make sweat with no heat

[Timbaland]
I'm up on this track, like Pam Grier in movies
I heats up the beat, like water in a jacuzzi
I fly to L.A., then come back to Virginia
Then call, Maganoo, to see, he's got some indo
Then back to the crib to pick up my brother, G
G, don't forget, to bring the house keys
Hops in the eight, five-oh, now here we go
Please, please, brother don't slam my car door
It costs too much money to get that {*shit*} fixed
I need all my money to pay my bills with
Don't have no time, for the, shuckin' and jivin'
Peep my rhyme, cause that, {*shit's*} off-timin'

[Missy Elliott (Timbaland in background)]
I'm in the Marriott, the place to get got
After I smoke {*pot*}, he sticks me like shots
Funky, like farts, connect tongues like dots
Lick his lollipop, this kid, named Scott
Meet, my hot self, my self be so hot
Touch my hot spot, I scream til I can't stop
UHHHHHHHHHHHH! (What, what...)
Give it to me daddy, and
UHHHHHHHHHHHH! (What, what...)
Yup, yup, like Teddy
Teddy, ready with tha one-two checka
No Diggity, Missy be the bedroom, wrecker
Double Decker, make you wanna beat yo {*pecker*}
And then leave yo {*bitch*} cause this UH! be better

[Timbaland, Magoo &amp; Missy Elliott (Aaliyah)]
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps, me (Give it up)
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps, me
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps, me (Give it up)
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps, me

Chorus: Timbaland, Magoo &amp; Missy Elliott (Aaliyah)
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps, me (Give it up, we gon' show)
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps, me (You how we party)
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps, me (Give it up, we gon' show)
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps, me (You how we party)

(Verse 2)
[Magoo]
Prepare to get wet like Jheri Curl juice
You short, can't reach the top, I might give you a boost
I bump like ac-ne, take honey from a bee
My style is like a safe, I swallow the master key
I gas cause I'm a fart, don't tank, but make heart
Like black and white people, I'm split and rap apart
So sit you bleedin' dog, and bow to my hit
Nitwit you stupid, I'm butter, don't need grits
Make fits like seizure, my knowledge feed ya
Study, then read ya, follow the leader
Like {*Jews*} and Chinese, I own your rap lease
The wackness must cease, prepare for your release

[Timbaland]
I'm up in these labels tryin' to, handle my business
Been makin' more beats, before, Jehovah had witness
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps, me
Brother, brother, please, turn on the TV
See a black man dead, from a white man's powder
See a white man scared, from, a black man's power
Back to reality, please don't freakin' smile at me
This is a stick-up, so give up your wallet please

[Missy Elliott]
I'm the best
And that's B
And that's capital
I hang low like {*testicles*}, emcees wanna copy these many flows
{*Hoes*}
Better back up
'Fore, they get slapped up
Pack up, they go tell mommy
That I backed up
I back up you, you, you, you, and your whole crew
What-whatcha-whatcha gon' do, uh
Uh, whatcha gon' do
To me
The M-I-Double S-Y E. (S-Y-E)
Wanna battle me
There's gonna be some tragedy

Repeat Chorus Twice

Repeat Hook Til Fade</pre>
