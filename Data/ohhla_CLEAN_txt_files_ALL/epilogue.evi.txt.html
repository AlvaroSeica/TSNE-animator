[Evidence]
Yeah, uh.. a-one, two
Uh, had to dim the lights for this shit
Preem, uh.. (GO!)

Makin beats half of my life
Some I gave away but never at half price
No dice 'til I call it a night, get it right
Sayin might one more time, then +My Name is D-Nice+ 
("My name-my name is D-Nice") No question, total silence
Better yet, better get a set of +Pliers+
The heavy metal king, Chaka Demus is my idol (yea)
Competitin with my rivals, proof for my title
...So who the fuck don't tour?
No one, music don't sell no more
Watch out now, this shit'll be so embarrassing
Your merch vs. my world - there's no comparison 
(Lost...) Yeah yeah, I'm pickin pockets
The bass up, deliberately knockin (boom)
Big picture lens, try to see it all then crop it
(Now...) That all depends how you break it down and chop it
Fuck coppin a big body Benz
when you keep friends who +Check to Check+ and barely makin profits
(Uh!) Instead of tryin to say E's quite obnoxious 
(Well...) You could say E rules my synopsis (Hahahaha)
Uh, it's pourin pots and pans
on the grey lots and spoits barely travelled by man
Only been a couple hours since I landed (true)
and rollin up these trees I got handed
It's hard to take his name in vain, but God-damn it
