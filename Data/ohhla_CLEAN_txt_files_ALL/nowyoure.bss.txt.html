[Basshunter: repeat 2X]
Now you're gone; I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
with your pictures hanging on the wall

[DJ Mental Theo's Bazzhead]
A-a-a-a-are you ready?

[Basshunter]
Now you're gone; I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy, now you're gone

[DJ Mental Theo's Bazzhead]
Ready for takeoff, ready for takeoff
Ready, ready, ready, ready...
R-r-r-r-ready for takeoff!

[Basshunter]
Now you're gone; I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
with your pictures hanging on the wall
There's an empty place in my heart
Without my only it will break apart
It won't heal it never fades away
I'll go crazy, now you're gone

Now you're gone; I realized my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
with your pictures hanging on the wall
Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
Now I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy, now you're gone</pre>
