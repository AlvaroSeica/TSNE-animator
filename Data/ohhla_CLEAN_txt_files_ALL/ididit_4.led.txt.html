[Rick Ross]
Hundred in the mula got more diamonds than a jeweler
Top down on the car, might be ridin with a shooter
Nigga down to do ya, I ain't fuckin with a curl bar
Nickle plated Ruger have you in a box on WorldStar
Duck nigga, duck nigga
Duck nigga, duck nigga where I'm from you called a fuck nigga
Pistol in the freezer, spend a kilo on the visa
Courtside SportsCenter, I can make you a believer (swish)
Everybody goin broke, keep it real you gotta fight it
Hundred kilos in the Beemer, boy don't make me get excited
Couple milli' on the neck like I'm tryin to get indicted
Got a mansion, got a yacht, bad bitch and a tiger
Ugh~! Real niggaz takin over televisions
Dope boys riding in a new set of Benzes
+Hot Boy+, young boy, still +On Fire+
What's a death sentence cause we all gotta die

[Chorus]

[Meek Mill]
Nino! Sittin on them M's, man shit is gettin realer
Ricky Diesel got my hood lookin like scrilla
Buyin all these foreigns I be in and out the dealer
Just to let my niggaz hold on when they rollin, it could kill 'em
And these suckaer, I dont feel 'em; I dont even see 'em
I'ma die fly, rest in peace Aaliyah
Half my dogs dead, the rest of them is here
If all your jewels fake, how the fuck we gon' believe ya?
Said I did it for my dogs, did it for my dogs
E'rybody ridin 'til you seen 'em in the morgue
Started with a body now I'm sittin in a Porsche
With the shooters right behind me shit you lookin at a boss
Rose gold Roley on my wrist, flawless!
Hundred bottles send 'em to the VIP, ballin
Basketball leather in the Benz, Spalding
Y'all niggaz talkin, fuck is y'all retarded?

[Chorus] - 1/2

[French Montana]
I did it for my dogs
Did it for them niggaz with a vision like a boss
Did it for them niggaz in the kitchen with the salt
Now I'm in that white thing, 500 horses for my niggaz in the coffin
But got bikes in my hand and a drop head Roley
Staring at the ceiling when I wake up in the mornin
My dog doin life, try to see him 'fore he hit the coffin
Playin with my paper, run up in your offices
It's the oh-twelve Ice Cube nigga with the Raider hat
A maniac nigga, where the paper at?
Highway to life, need a hundred mill' exit
Fifty on the wrist, hundred on the necklace

[Chorus] - 1/2

[Jadakiss]
AH_HAH~! Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yo - watch who you drinkin with, watch who you smokin with
One point seven in my safe when I open it (cash)
If I put seven in ya face, will I open it?
And I know tomorrow ain't promised but I hope it is
Love to get acquainted with you, stay and tear the jail up
Did it for my dogs, so I had to put the bails up
Get them thangs off so I haven't put the scales up
Treat you like a pit, get your ears and ya tail cut
Chopper still hot, you can hold it for yourself
Versace, same buckle on the loafers and the belt
Yeah them pills is flyin but the smokers is somethin else
If the spot catch fire, the coke'll just really melt
The dough got 'em bringin in the broads
Obvious the flow got 'em screamin for the Lord
If there's money on your head, what you think is the reward?
I ain't do it for myself, you know who I did it for?

[Rick Ross]
I did it for my dogs (I did it for my dogs)
Oh Lord!</pre>
