[Zack de la Rocha]
Satellites and, pair of mirrors and 
and a man with-out a home
With a horse, and a rider 
and a clever, cunnin killer
Silent in error and, vocal in spotlights
Lying always, sucking on a bottle of 
that sweet, indulgent fluid
Oh greed, oh yes, oh greed, OH YES!!

[Sounds of repeated yells and "OH GREED, OH YES" follows]

YEAH!! (Twenty-six years in this stage...)
YEAH!!
YEAH!! (You're...twenty-six years in this stage...)
YEAH!!

Your friendship is a fog!
That disappears when the wind re-DIRECTS - YOU!!!!
YES, YOU!!!

[Tom Morello's weird guitar solo followed by sounds of moaning and rhythmic panting]

Father's expectations.. 
Soul soaked in, spit and urine..
And you gotta make it where?
To a, sanctuary that's a fragile American hell
An empty dream...
A selfish, horrific vision
Passed on like the, deadliest of viruses
Crushin you and, your naive profession!!

{pantings in background}

Have no illusions, boy!!
Vomit, all ideals and serve
Sleep and, wake and, serve and
don't just, think just, WAKE AND SERVE AND!!!!

YEAH!! (You're now...twenty-six years in this stage...)
YEAH!!
YEAH!! (You're...twenty-six years in this stage...)
YEAH!!

Yeah, your friendship is a fog!
That disappears when the wind redirects - YOU!!
Interested in YOU!!! Interested in YOU!!!
Interested in YOU!!! Interested in YOU!!!
Interested in YOU!!! Interested in YOU!!!
Interested in YOU!!! Interested in YOU!!!
Interested in YOU!!! Interested in YOU!!
Interested in YOU!! Interested in YOU!!
Interested in YOU!! Interested in you!
Interested in you...Interested in you...
Interested in you...interested in you...
{Interested in you. Interested in you.
Interested in you. Interested in you.
Interested in you. Interested in you...}</pre>
