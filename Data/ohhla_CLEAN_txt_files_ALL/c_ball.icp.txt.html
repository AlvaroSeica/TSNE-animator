Lookin my crystal ball it's alright
Welcome, my curious sisters and brothers
First, put a twenty in the jar with the others
(That's right take a seat)
Aint no smokin in here, I need to keep my ball clear
There spirits in there 
(Whats your future, someone gonna shoot ya)
Will you get your girlfriend back, as if I know that
I can only tell you where your soul is headed
And will remain eternaly embeded, the rest forget it
Life is nothin but a test to clear
Did you have a heart while you where here
And was it sincere?
Your still unraveling your future right now
What kinda person are ya bro, oh, where there you go
You control your own muthafuckin' destiny
I aint lettin' the devil get the best of me
(I'm gonna make it into Shangri-la) golden walls
Whats up with you check your own crystal balls
Lookin my crystal ball its allright
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright

Lookin in my crystal ball im seein' thugs
Both catchin' and firin' slugs (paper for drugs)
I see a line waiting on block cheese a mile long
all tryin to be strong (It's the same old song)
But when i look into everybodys faces (smile) 
Thier soul are headed other places
And they aint worried about payin them dues down here
(Because they mother fuckin future is crystal clear)
The focus switches to you and it ain't good
All mad cause someone rolls up out the neighborhood
Check your self and the judgment was passed
Yo, you be in hell (right up the asshole) 
It will get ya if ya let it pack your speedo's 
I hear it's hot where you headed
I'm trying to tell ya now (when the grim reaper calls)
You dont wanna be ass out grippin' your crystal balls

Lookin my crystal ball its alright 
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright
Lookin my crystal ball its alright 
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright

Look into my crystal ball its all black
And everybodys frozen in time front to back
Their controlled by the matrix of mind, body and soul
And I'm branded by the system of carnival freekshow
I see the fame analyize cause nothin is the skyz
It's the same as seein the death in the demons eyes
I'm high in my sights, from the truth of my crystal ball
Believe me when I say we comin for all of y'all
Look deep into my crystal ball
See the dead smokin on trees and drinking alchohol
Underneath the street beneath the concrete
If you listen to the night you can hear my heart beat
All painted up buried in a axe and shit
Juggalo love got each others backs and shit
Encased in glass for the whole world to see
Am I inside, or is the crystal ball inside of me

Lookin my crystal ball its alright (8X)
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright
{*fades out*}

rain comes down (Lookin my crystal ball it's alright)
{*repeats until song ends*}</pre>
