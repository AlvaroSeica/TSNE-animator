(Kangol Slim)

Yo, this P-N-C,
Comin' at you, with my girl Ms. Tee,
One Time,
There's a lot of brothers out there that try to duplicate,
Knowin' we the ones that originate,
Tee, show'em how we do

Chorus (Ms. Tee &amp; Kangol Slim):

(Ms. Tee)

Tell me why you actin' funny?
With all your money?

(Kangol Slim)

Tell me why you actin' bad?
With your kitty kat?

Ms. Tee)

Tell me why you actin' funny?
With all your money?

(Kangol Slim)

Tell me why you actin' bad?
With your kitty kat?

First Verse (Kangol Slim):

Tell me Baby girl why you actin' funny?
Everytime you come around you gotta ask me for money,
Not really trickin' off, ain't my style,
But I might give you somethin' if it's worth my while,
I don't know, the games that you play,
But we don't play that, around my way,
The only money that I really plan to spend,
Is on me and you scorin' on La Quinta inn
Now Baby girl I can see on you face,
You really wanna hop up in the Z-28,
You know one thing, you ain't bout to get no money,
Round here stuntin' for your friends, tell me why you actin' funny?
You actin' bad with your kitty-kitty kat,
Knowin' that a brotha done already hit that,
You'z a wanna-be hot girl,
But you'z a cold girl,
In a Hot Girl's World

Chorus

Second Verse (Ms. Tee):

Ooh, say boy why you actin' funny?
You never wanna give me no lovin' or money,
You want some ass, don't wanna give up the cash,
You wanna sex me, then tell your boys and laugh,
Thought I would forgot about the things that we do?
Keep runnin' your mouth and ain't no love for you,
You wanna sex me, but don't wanna pay my bills,
And in the 9-8, you gonna have to hustle and heal,
Now you upsettin' me,
Wanna cry when they give you ten years in the pen,
But it wasn't like that, when you was home,
Now you keep on callin' my cellular phone,
And now I see,
You ain't no man,
You supposed to support me every way that you can,
Boy you want it, about my body,
And now I see, you ain't got no love for me
