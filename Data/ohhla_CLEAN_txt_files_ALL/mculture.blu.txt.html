That's my culture
My culture
That's what it's all about
That's my culture

I'ma keep it short, cause my time is short
This ain't a game to me, I don't rhyme for sport
This is life in the fast lane, speedin until I get caught
The last days of Jimi Hendrix lookin for lines to snort
This is the big one, cause Pac and Big done
They had a quick run, but now they victims to big guns
Same with Big L, they haven't charged anyone
It's a heavy load, the weight took Big Pun
They sprayed Jam Master Jay, nobody know the truth
Lupus took Jay Dee, shooters took big Proof
They layin in the cut, posted up on the roof
You got enough fame, they might even come for you
They got Busta's bodyguard, nobody said a thing
The game is gettin deep, AIDS came for Eazy-E
They found Saddam in a hole across the globe
But can't find killers livin in the same ZIP code
You think it's funny, man, ain't no coincidences
You gettin money here, they probably want you out of business
Go head and start trouble, they'll take you out without a witness
Or have you spendin life behind barbed wired fences

I'm talkin 'bout young-ass cats with federal indictments
Busted for hand-to-hands but ran instead of fightin it
Last thing I heard they was headed for the islands
Rather be a fugitive than a 25-to-lifer
I play the pied piper, the livest writer
Mercenary mic for hire, cause I write the fire
So ease back, soldier, hold your spot
You talkin like a high roller, we know you're not
I molotov all y'all, blow your spot
Soundin like broads rhymin 'bout the clothes you got
Sometimes I look at y'all and wonder what the fuck on your mind
Look around you, we livin in some troubling times
Iran and North Korea buildin nuclear bombs
Iraq and Afghanistan caught up in our wars
So when these rappers only rap about a home or a broad
It's cause they don't know what's happenin - at home or abroad
Protect your intelligence, they might insult ya
Hip-Hop been dead, man, it's time for the vultures
I'm just tryina get mine, and before it's all over
Cause who the fuck wanna die for they culture?

That's my culture
My culture
That's what it's all about
That's my culture</pre>
