Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

[ Marley Marl ]
I don't like it
You can't make me, I don't like it
I just don't like it

[ Daddy-O ]
We in there

[ MC Peaches ]
Yo Wicky Walter, what's up?
[ Wicky Walter ]
Hey Peaches, what's happenin?
[ MC Peaches ]
Nothin, won't you come to this party, the beat is slammin
[ Wicky Walter ]
Ah, I don't wanna go to a party
[ MC Peaches ]
Ah, come on
[ Wicky Walter ]
I don't like that beat
[ MC Peaches ]
Why not, what's the problem, it's slammin
[ Wicky Walter ]
Ah, I've had a terrible day and I just wanna go home, you know
[ MC Peaches ]
Yo, come on boy
[ Wicky Walter ]
No, I don't like that beat
[ MC Peaches ]
Come on
[ Wicky Walter ]
I don't like that beat!
[ MC Peaches ]
Yo, come on boy

[ Wicky Walter ]
I'm a guy that likes to keep on my clothes
I don't like a lotta people standin on my toes
I like to shoot a little pool when I get the chance
I like movies - but I don't dance
(W)rap to me is aluminum foil
That I put on food so it won't spoil
I'm not gonna rap so let's not fight it
The reason why, I just don't like it

[ CHORUS ]
I don't like this beat, I don't like it
(He don't like it)
I don't like this beat, I don't like it
(He don't like it)
I don't like this beat, I don't like it
(He don't like it)
I don't like it
(Hey, what's the problem with you?)
I say, I don't like this beat, I don't like it
(He don't like it)
I don't like this beat, I don't like it
(He don't like it)
I don't like this beat, I don't like it
(He don't like it)
Ah-ah, I don't like it

[ MC Peaches ]
Now this beat is funky, hittin hard
A hip-hop groove you hear the brothers blastin in their cars
It make the woofers and the tweeters sound sweet
It makes you dance and you start to get in real deep
So let's move, I know you wanna groove
Yo, grab the mic, I wanna see you get off real smooth
And fly, cause you're the type of guy the ladies adore
Come on Wicky Walter, give em some more

[ Wicky Walter ]
Now that's cool, but the beat is not slammin
To rap on this track is what I'm not havin
I wanna give the ladies a good hot show
That's gotta be sharp not wick-wack like my man Kurtis Blow
Who's still daydreamin
He lost his rap because his beats went beamin
Up just like Scotty
I'm not gonna choose this beat cause I don't wanna lose my party

[ CHORUS ]

[ Kedarr ]
Hey Heather
[ Heather ]
What Kedarr?
[ Kedarr ]
What's wrong with this guy Wicky Walter
[ Heather ]
I mean, this song is nice and everything
[ Kedarr ]
I mean the party's great, the food is great
[ Heather ]
I think I really don't understand...
[ Kedarr ]
There's omethin def-definitely wrong with this character
[ Heather ]
I know, right
[ Kedarr ]
I mean I just love the... enviroment, I mean it's just great
[ Daddy-O ]
On and on and...
[ Kedarr ]
Hey hey hey buddy, it's not your party, beat it, get outta here
[ Heather ]
Come on, what's wrong with you?

(Mother Hubbard ain't had no dog bones in her cupboard!)

[ (The Myke Control &amp;) Wicky Walter ]
(Yo E, man, I think that this beat is movin
You're right Ice, but money grip ain't groovin!
Yo, what you doin?) Heh, what you think?
(This beat is funky) So much it stinks
(Man, bust a rhyme) Like Young MC?
I don't wear no specks, I don't have no degree
(You might win a Grammy!) But that's not for me
Look Myke Control, I ain't havin it, gee

[ CHORUS ]

[ Wicky Walter ]
Yeah, discussion closed
I don't like this beat
Um-mh
Absolutely not

Yeah, I don't like it
No-no, ah-ah, don't you try to convince me
I - no-o, no way mama
Nooo way
Absolutely not
Hey, that's it!
That's it!
That's the beat that I like</pre>
