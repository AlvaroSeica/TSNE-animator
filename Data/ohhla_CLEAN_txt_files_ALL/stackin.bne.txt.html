[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
As we travel around the world (world)
Stackin that paper, stackin that paper
And tell me what's gonna really look good
I keep it poppin so these haters comin to hate us, hate us (move out!)
As we travel around the world (world)
Stackin that paper, stackin that paper
And tell me what's gonna really look good
I keep it poppin so these haters comin to hate us (get off, get off!)

[Bizzy Bone]
I can answer you quicker than them
Shall I be can't keepin my mouth closed, keepin my mouth closed
I don't chase 'em they fuckin with me
You don't fuck with me when I'm down and out though, when I'm down and out though
I keep 'em happy, they jealous of me
They jealousies no doubt yo, no doubt yo
And lookin for somethin they want to attack
Pushin 'em back, knockin 'em out cold, knockin 'em out cold (woo!)
What do you want from me, they don't want your dreams, they want reality
They get up inside yo' head you tell 'em "I'm dead" and tell 'em "Get out of me"
Will they try to rob me in the direction we chill?
I'm only movin by the grace of the Lord, it's God's hill
Huh, go get that vittle money, for real
They better not fuck with us, we get 'em honey, what the deal
There go the other testin, mic checker, dippin skill
For somebody to influence baby, I don't want nothin but liquor and beer
Huh, listenin into the hearts of a Bizzy, apart of me time to grow
And if you don't know me now, what do I know 'bout myself
I'm takin it slow, admit it I'm a little bit different than others
I'm takin it slowly cause no one can trust ya, you my brother, you my brother
One time

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
Just got me a new 'llac with fo' do's, nigga that's the shit
Brand new 20-inches with fresh Vouges, had to have that shit
Slam the do's on my Caddy coupe, crankin it up and smash the gas
I really don't know where I'm headed yet but I'm leanin hard, chasin cash
Mobbin, through the grimy streets, bendin quarters, takin notes
You know these folks is watchin me so you know I gots to watch these folks
That's the shit, playin for keeps off in this deadly game
Thuggin and lovin to get me some change
'til the day I die, I'm down fo' my thang
I'm goin against the grain, after the rats with the cheese
D-boys in the industry wanna break bread, you feelin me?
From Detroit, Minnesota, Sacramento, North Dakota
I'm kickin it when you see me dawg, I'm from Cleveland, we rollers
Hold up - let me expose us baby, we's the shit
Livin legends in yo' presence, 'Pac and Eazy bitch
That nigga Hollis pushin buttons while we blowin a sack
In the sack with Sac, and nigga that's just that

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
If you was fightin me, fightin behind me, give me some money or give me some change
Steadily workin to keep it movin, if it was groovin I'd do it again
One of them now don't know what they playin and treatin the knowledge
Don't weak up the rhyme and they probably think that 
because of my brain I be runnin I'm comin to die, mine
Come in a time, medical federal, what is known don't have to be spoken
Do it congruently, makin the music so truly
I'm keepin it movin and leavin the secrets of pickin and movin and cyclin
Effortless player I don't want no Bentley baby, I'm keepin it quiet
Roll out, they start a riot, no now, baby don't even try it
No doubt, pickin up his die to get the mission with precision
That's the superstition set aside, showdown
I smoke the chronic baby, peace release me is mine, it is mine
Better go play babyyyyy - I'm sprayin this motherfucker
And let me go play baby - gonna go get a beer
Handle your business and diminish the thoughts
The elevation of survival when it's vital, the rock (rock)
Dedication of the love for myself, the love for my health
The love for my stealth, the love of everybody else
And I'm comin to meet that little baby, you stayin on top
You know what we do baby, solid as a motherfuckin rock

[Chorus]

Get off, get off! {*3X*}</pre>
