[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
See that's the good thing 'bout my hair man
All I do is put water on that shit
So when I pull a joint out it be all greasy and oily
Turn up! Uh!

[Verse One: Wiz Khalifa]
Your flow a dime a dozen, my flow you gotta love it
My city hot as fuckin, came from the bottom of it
But not a product of it, bitch all my rides are custom
Smokin my ganja public, I'm all about that money ('Bout that money)
Dressed like e'vryday sunny
Roll a weed like a Marley, smile like e'vrything funny
But this industry shady, most these niggas are crazy
Most of them quick to lose they soul, no if or a maybe
These nudies what I'm wearin, the truth is what you hearin
The bong is what I'm clearin, the kush is overbearin
Ferrari's what I'm stearin, I'm smokin while I'm drivin
Keep lookin in the mirror, make sure no one's behind us
'Cause niggas get jealous
When your bank start to swell up, so much the people at the bank start to tell us
You need to have somebody bank for you fellas, damn!

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Look at me! Look at me! 
Look at me! Look at them and look at me!
Look at me! Look at me! 
Look at me! Look at them and look at me!

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
I paint a perfect picture, a perfect portrait
Poverty robbery killed or be killed psychology
I shine just me and my nine, scoopin nigga 8 o'clock sharp
Like it's Columbine, guess I'm one of a kind
I see you niggas soft with, the shell hit ya face I'll hit ya wake
Then flip your coffin, bitch get the walkin
It's Sabrina's orphan, I'm like what fire is to thirty eight to pop Cyrus
Warriors I'm victorious, come out, to playyyyy!!!
I mean right away!
Shit Pharoah Gamo, imperial on money draws
Outlaw a nigga break all kind of laws
It's hard bottom line, time money frozen time
A.P. royal oak, kush smoke, bag coke, push the dope
Cut throat, so what, I cut throat, fuck with hoes
So I ain't gotta say it's time to go
She already know, fo' sho', when it's time to go

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Look at me! Look at me! 
Look at me! Look at them and look at me!
Look at me! Look at me! 
Look at me! Look at them and look at me!</pre>
