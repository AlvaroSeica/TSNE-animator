[Intro - Royce Da 5'9"/Mr. Porter]
Boy, I done warned you
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
Better listen up close nigga, don't trip
Yo heat's in the car, mine's in this bitch (oh! oh! oh!)

[Verse 1 - Royce Da 5'9"]
I pull up clean, manners of a gentleman, trigger man, etiquette
One felony away from a predicate
That Pa-tr√≥n's my medicine
Them stones blowin like they owned by Edison
I am on my better than, everybody tip
Walk up in the club make, everybody strip
Everybody get (*gun cocked*), the fuck down, this a brrrp, stick up
But I don't want no money, I want your (*burp*) liquor
I'm a homicidal maniac, I know
Clip full of hollows
Models, swallow, gobble, smoke mad lala
Stretch you out, so bad, you'll be able to kiss your own ass bye bye (*muah*)

[Chorus - Mr. Porter]
Now boy, I done warned you
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
Better listen up close nigga, don't trip
Yo heat's in the car, mine's in this bitch
(Oh! oh! oh!), mine's in this bitch
(Oh! oh! oh!), mine's in this bitch
Better listen up close nigga, don't trip
Yo heat's in the car, mine's in this bitch

[Verse 2 - Royce Da 5'9"]
What the fuck do you mean, that I can't fuck bitch? Fuck this, I've been dope
Flashy but I don't mean my money, I mean I'm nude under a trench coat
I put the wreck in reckless, the 'sult in insult
When you fuck bitches they be like "uh"
When I fuck bitches they be like "AHHHHHH!"
I'm a fuckin rapist, atheist, say yes, say no, (*scream*), KO
Aiyyo, I'm a piranha, my pen is in the condom
And you are the vagina, your flow is and ah kinda, so you can blow my anaconda
Treacherous methods, respect my grammar and I (*gunshot*), oh I made you look
Insane sixteens and crazy hooks
I will fuck up, prostitute raw for I fall
Follow me like I'm Allahu Akbar (rock star)

[Chorus]

[Break - Mr. Porter]
You wanna see where the stars is at (HO!)
We over here, where the bottles at? (HO!)
You want a problem, I'm all for that (HO!)
'Cause you won't make it to the car for that

[Interlude - Mr. Porter]
Now ohh
N-N-Now ohhN-N-Now ohh
N-N-Now ohh, nana

[Royce Da 5'9" - talking over Interlude]
You are now dealin with the biggest criminal in the world
Welcome to Gotham City, it's a star tonight

[Verse 3 - Royce Da 5'9"]
What the fuck do you mean, that I ain't in shape? Go bag Nelly
I go and get me a fat bitch, we gonna slap bellies
I keep a box of rubbers, cock, I got ya covered
That's right I talk to my cock often like "cock, they love ya"
Haha, I walk the block with a oven but not your mother's
I'm talkin about the other, by the way - your mother
I'm terrific, I'm the president, I'm Obama-rific
Make up my own words, I'm the shitidic (I'm the shitidic, *laughing*)
