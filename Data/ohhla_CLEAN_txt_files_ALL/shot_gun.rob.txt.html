"Shotgun

Shotgun
Shoot it 'fore he run, now" --&gt; JR Walker and the All Stars

[Lil Rob]
(Verse 1)
They get it poppin' and I come in blastin'
Like a shotgun, it's not the first time I shot one
Hit the stage like a twelve gauge
It's blowin' out the barrel like a bow and arrow
Bullseye!
Lil Rob, oh my
They say "He's dead," but he's so alive
And that's no jive
Put my tones into the microphone over the saxophones
And he hittin' somethin' crazy
Turn up the bass and bump it, baby
And keep it blastin', everlastin'
With the volume, way passin'
Keep 'em duckin' and dodgin'
Who the fuck are they callin', callin' the cops in
Don't you know
There ain't no stoppin' my

Repeat Chorus

[Lil Rob]
Yeah
Lil Rob...
That's right...
Hey man, we're just bumpin' them oldies, you know what I mean...
Yeah...
So turn it up...
And make it bump...
Yeah...
Orale

(Verse 2)
All you hear is the boom
Makin' you shake like a California earthquake when I break
Get the fuck out my way
I suggest you lay low when I'm in way low
Lower than my low-low
Around the world like a yo-yo, I'm going loco
In the cabeza, must be the yesca
Yepa, yepa, yepa, yepa, yepa
Bout to pour me a shot
Shoot my shot, but stop a shot, hey holmes, why not
Bout to pour me a shot
Shoot my shot, but stop a shot, hey holmes, why not
Let 'em go, let 'em blow, let 'em spray
Let me blow them fucking dumb asses away
Hey
Don't you know
You can't fuck with my

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
I represent California
I'm kickin' back at the pad
With a pen and a pad, and a drag
And a zag, Lil Rob got a brand new bag
Send 'em back and I'm bad
When I'm bad and I'm brown, hey, we ain't fucking around, ey
Ay yo, Javi, grab me another fuckin' beer, man, yeah
I'm bustin' off like a shotty
For all the haters and the ones who forgot me
Yeah
You see
You can forget, anyone, that you like
I'm making sure that it's not me
Cause I'll be busting like my

Repeat Chorus

[Lil Rob]
Alright...
That's right...
Uh hun...
That's how we get down, that's how we put it down, yeah...
That's right...
Yeah, you can't fuck with my...
