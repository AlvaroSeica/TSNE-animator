"I wanna ask you one question
If I had some nuts, hangin on the walls, what did I have honey?"
I said, "Darling you'd have some walnuts."
She said, "Well.. daddy if I had some nuts
on my chest, would those be chestnuts?"
I said, "Hell yes!"
She said, "Well daddy if I had nuts under my chin
would those be chin-nuts?"
I said, "Hell no bitch you'd have a dick in your mouth!" {*echoes*}

[Dr. Dre]
Back with some shit that gots to bump 
As you pull up in the park you pops the trunk
Just to floss it like a motherfuker, clownin an' shit
Got the Dana's on your hooptie and your fly-ass bitch
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that hoe
If she proper, I'ma pop her, the hole hopper
It's back on the track
With big money, big nuts, and a big fat chronic sack

[Snoop]
So Daz, step up on they ass
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past

[Daz]
Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote
With my nigga D-R-E, so you know I must be dope
But uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass
Startin static with Dre, make way for the AK
that I bring as I slang like cavi
Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy
Had he, not known about the city I'm from
Long Beach, tic tac, grab your gat, watch your back
Here I come, stompin in my kahki suit
B.G. from the hood, kinfolk Eastwood
God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up
on top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling

[Snoop]
But could you raise up off his nuts?
Cause Dr. Drizze's about to rizzip shit up

[Snoop] You're tuned to the sounds of the D-R-E

[Dr. Dre]
Now check me out, it's back to the old school
Where the niggaz get they strap on, don't nobody cap on
Slap on some D-R-E
Or some funky ass shit by the D-O-double-G-Y D-O-double-G
Real G's who drop ki's
Protect these, N-U-T's, so nigga please
Peep out my manuscript
You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit (BE-OTCH!)
So recognize game from the gangsta
Thangs will remain the same until I change 'em

[Snoop]
It's real easy to see
So you can check sounds from Nate D-O-double-G
