???
gully
just wanted to tell you you're the meaning of truth
you deserve the best
I wanna get back to you
I'll always be hear for you
forever

[Chorus]
i've been meaning to call you
how are you?
I miss you dearly
I didn't call you to argue
I love you
I need you near me
we've been waiting for so long
just hold on
I'm ready to come home
we'll be gettin' our roll on
'cause I'm coming back for you

what happened to the attitude
????
I'll do anything for you
I just don't want to see you mad
can't forget about the times we shared
on the phone we had
came a long way since the days of playing number tag
now you wonder where I'm at
I'm probably somewhere on the map
liked the way you lick your fingers
snapped like where my... like where my
I was out grinding
you was at your momma's house crying
we're just victims of bad timing
now I think a little smarter
I work a little harder
trying to live a decent life that you would wanna be a part of
am I worth the trouble
I think about it often
the first ??? of me corrupting you is when I'm walking
life unknown is worth the price of gold
this is it
I commit
never let me go

[Chorus]

I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you

love me when I'm gone
never do me wrong
and when we get it on it's like the sweetest song
your body let me know when the heat is on
grind to the beat
to the break of dawn
you're the only one
take my heart
the passion
the joan of arc
you're like a work of art
made beautiful like a tone from my heart
I'm trying to play the part
you were sent to me
it was meant to be
and when I close my eyes
it was energy
it was you and me

[Chorus]

I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you
I'm coming back for you</pre>
