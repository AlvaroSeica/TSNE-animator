Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I don't care what they think about me [x3] (Evaluation)
My mental evaluation says I need help [x2]

I reposition in a
Fatal position then ill
Choke him out until he's
Out of commission then I'll
Drive around looking where I can ditch him a
Dark road out of town with no sign of a witness (woo!)
I don't care about a punk ass shrink, all he wants is the medicate the way I think, (here take this)
And I can do that shit on my own 'cause I don't need no help from some unknown
Head therapist telling me how it is (Hell naw)
He tryna get me to tell him my bizz (Hell naw)
I'm getting pissed I don't need this fool
Thinking that I'm gonna break down and trust you?

I don't care what they think about me [x3] (Evaluation)
My mental evaluation says I need help [x2]

Evaluation huh?
I'm no longer a patient
I'm in the back seat of your car just waiting
'Cause I don't take what people say about me kindly
So when I see you then I'll put it all behind me
Not in a good way 'cause I keep a long grudge
You kept pushing but I would not budge
I be the type that you don't wanna fight
I'm street with it you might not come home that night
So, say what you will but I don't need no pill to turn me into a zombie with no thrill (no thrill)
Naw, I wanna be accidental and not some test 'bout me 'cause you think that I'm mental

I don't care what they think about me [x3] (Evaluation)
My mental evaluation says I need help [x2]

How long have I've been mentally insane?
And do I think I might need to be restrained?
Before I cause myself or someone else pain
With my anger so bad that I can't be tamed

How long have I've been mentally insane? (HELP) [x4]
And do I think I might need to be restrained? (HELP) [x4]
Before I cause myself or someone else pain, (HELP) [x4]
With my anger so bad that I can't be tamed (HELP) [x4]

I don't care what they think about me [x3] (Evaluation)
My mental evaluation says I need help [x2] (Help)
My mental evaluation says I need help
(Men [x3] Mentally Insane...)
(I can't be tamed)
My mental evaluation says I need help</pre>
