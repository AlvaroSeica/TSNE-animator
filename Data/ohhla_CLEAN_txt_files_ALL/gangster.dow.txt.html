[Slush "The Villain"(Talkin)]
Ha Ha
Slush "The Villain"
Shadow all up in this mothafucka
Hella High, off that sticky gram weed
Livin the thug life, sellin drug life
Packin snubs, smokin weed all day bud life
Can't fuck wit it baby

[Mr. Shadow]
It's the unfadable, confrontation with I is consequencial
Me and Slush "The Villain" makin your advisories parental
Fuck a presidental limosine
I roll wit thugs in maximas on Lomos
Or Impalas on chrome d's 
Follow me and see why everybody calls me hostile
How mothafuckas be hatin cause I live a gangsta lifestyle
My profile is so wild you wouldn't wanna kick it
With these two young thugs, packin snubs and gettin convicted
Inflictin much pain like my a.k.a. was migrain
Make a fool swallow piss for disrespectin my name
From the sky falls rain to the streets you'll fall victim
And all I got to say to my thugs is fuck the system
The Mistah Shadow is who I be up on this paragraph
Makin fools panic cause they heard about the aftermath
I'm at the point of no return and so I keep burnin
Marijuina cause I want the higher learner

[Chorus: Slush "The Villain" and Mr. Shadow]
We straight gangstas, bangers, dope slangers
Bitch stranglers, who wanna come and playa hate us
Money makers, world wide got it locked
Walkin 50 deep through your mothafuckin block
[2x]

[Slush "The Villain"]
For all my enemies I got them gats too
Me and my faculities bodies covered up with tattoos
So when you see me it's intimidation that you feel
Cause you know these fuckin Eses mess for real
Cause we're soldado down to throw putasos
Con chiflasos tricky let's throw chingasos
I got Shadow on the side of me
With that gram sticky green mothafucka
Come get high with me
And if you say you'se my homie, don't decieve me
Cause when I say I'm gonna kill, you best believe me

[Mr. Shadow]
Even out of town we break mothafuckas down like car trouble
Tricky grab an axe and a shovel
Show these sons of hood rats who gots the bag of tricks
Full of guns, ammunition, screwdrivers and ice picks
We pick who dies, when the wolf cries
Brutalize mothafuckas, catch em by surprise
We're unexpekted like a car crash
Head bash a mothafucka, and give him whip lash
Think fast, blink and it's your ass up in pieces
Have your mom screamin for Jesus

[Chorus]

[Slush "The Villian"]
I give's a fuck mothafucka
Down to buck mothafuckas
Better duck or that ass'll get plucked mothafucka
I got all I need to suceed, let's get to test em
Pocket full of weed and a gun that's full of teflon
I'ma mothafucka thug with no love
I'm seein my enemies bleedin sleepin in their blood
I'm fantasizin homicidal thoughts like Charles Manson
Money schemin plots to come up, like hold you for ransom
It's all about the skrilla homie, I'll put a price on your head
And iIf they don't pay up by mornin best believe that you're dead
Playin wit your life like God but I don't care
Ain't gon let nobody stop me from bein a millionaire
It be a gun blast ese till one of us dies
Best believe tryin to aim my heat right between your eyes
Only on my bullet, my name I'm gonna engrave
Slush "The Villain" put that ass to the grave, mothafucka

[Chorus]</pre>
