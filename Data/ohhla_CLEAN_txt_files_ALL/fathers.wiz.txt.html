[Young Wiz]
This goes out to my family, close ones
Don't give up! You're alive for a reason
My cousin, ?Aje?, yeah you locked down
But you ain't there, keep goin'!
To all the soldiers, warriors, runnin' this race and do it to the end
Realize everyone, that you in the Father's Heart, check it out

[Verse One]
First it was Mel, in the club, hit with a shell
Now his moms and pops is like, "Lord, where did we fail?"
Tony, Romano, and Shawn ballin' too fast
They hit a curve, car done crash
Now they moms is on the streets, takin' a blast
Because they passed away, certain things will happen
in your life to make you pray.
Live better for your seed, so they can breath today
You ain't perfect, get it right, and it's okay
We was born messed up, no lie, confess up
He knows your situation's a struggle but, guess what?
You ain't gotta be like that, so rest up
He sent His Son to shed the blood, live, that's what
After the foundation, we was apart
One man didn't do right from start
Unseen forces throwin' darts, got your head
spinnin' like a go-cart, but don't give up, why?
'Cause you on the Father's heart

[Chorus - singer 4X w/ ad-libs]
Don't give up, 'cause you are, on the Father's he-a-art

[Verse Two]
Things ain't the same no mo', parents they don't
cry out to the Lord, they don't get on they knees and hit the flo'
That's why we havin' abortions, they on the streets
paying for extortions, livin' a lie, dyin' for the fortune
The Father's heart remorsin' for the dead, but there's hope
for the li-vin' release the Son in the earth
For the given for the death in the grave, He paved the way
No longer living as slaves, that's why we watch and pray (Thank God I am freeeeee)
In these end times, I hope these rhymes they bless your mind
Get that peace, so you can live fine
We ain't promised tomorrow, receive the one livin' in horror
Before it gets better, it has to be, plenty of sorrow (plenty of sor-row)
Let's come together, instead of being apart
Let's shine some light, in the midst of the dark
And the words that I say, if you hear 'em clearly
They comin' from, the Fathers heart, please feel me

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
God bless all people in nations, 'cause we was all made
in His creation, but we faced with deadly situations
That's killing this world's population, it's an unseen war
Babies being torn, don't know what they here for
But my Father's gonna settle the score, and that's the truth
Not just facts, I promise you He said that
Got you covered like plaque, hold on, be strong
Ain't no turning back, time is moving quicker sayin'
"Put the crack down, my young dealers
Confused thoughts tryna to trick ya
Stay focused, 'cause the end is near-a"
Hear it clear like a dog's loud bark
Separating the fishes, from the sharks
Revealin' secrets like an unseen NARC
I know you hear me, feel me
And yeah, it's comin' from, the Father's heart..
