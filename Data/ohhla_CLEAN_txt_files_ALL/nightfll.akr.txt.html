[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
Let me tell you about the nightfall (nightfall)
There's certain spots you don't want to be
and your ride might stall (what?, might stall, what?)
'Cause livin life out here is wicked
To roam the sidewalks that's littered with dirty diapers and losin scratch tickets
When the sun go down, the rules change
Sometimes it seems the ghetto nightime is like a shootin range
Here's how it runs, guns pop like blackheads (what?)
Targets be the prostitutes, gang foes and crackheads
Rides runnin red lights, with no headlights in dead night
So nigga get your head right
You can't walk a block without catchin a dirty look
And dirty kids is cuttin dirty pages out of dirty books
And dirty crooks, they control the streets
Because they sold the streets, now they roll in fleets
I got no crime record but it's like I live in a prison cell
'Cause when the night falls, shit is like a livin hell, nightfall

[Chorus - Akrobatik]
Let me tell you about the nightfall (nightfall) - 2X

When night falls, your whole state of mind can change
When night falls, the most normal shit be lookin strange
Honor roll students, they be actin deranged
When night falls, when night falls, come on

Let me tell you about the nightfall (nightfall) - 2X

[Verse 2 - Akrobatik]
A word to the wise, when you roam the streets that's desolate
I'm stressin shit, you gots to watch who you messin with (yes)
And if you in the rhyme cyphers under street lights
Rock the beat right or be prepared for a street fight
Each block is cluttered with street pharmacies
Starvin kids and shitty diapers, home alone, they don't know where their mommas be
It's reminiscent of Somalia
Instead of malnutrition though, nigga's what they callin ya
It's kind of like we're waitin for a savior
While the cages that we're dwellin in, are turned to graveyards
And what they're writin on our headstone
Is that when night falls, the ghetto be turnin into the dead zone, nightfall

[Chorus - Akrobatik] - w/ ad libs
Let me tell you about the nightfall (nightfall) - 2X

When night falls, your whole state of mind can change
When night falls, the most normal shit be lookin strange
Honor roll students, they be actin deranged
When night falls, when night falls, come on

Let me tell you about the nightfall (nightfall) - 2X

[Verse 3 - Akrobatik]
Sometimes I wonder if there's niggaz far away in the stars
Lookin down at us, laughin at the way that we are
Or is they cryin?? 'Cause unecessarily we be dyin
Nowadays you get killed over which shorty you eyin
The moonlight effects my people kind of like the werewolf
Now every nigga think he John Wilkes Booth
But despite the decreased visibility
I maintain the ability to possess mental agility
So I ain't on the block lookin for Jake
I'm at the crib tryin to get my girl to stop watchin "Ricki Lake"
"As The World Turns," one fact burns
Every 24 hours, night fall returns (what?), nightfall

[Chorus - Akrobatik]
Let me tell you about the nightfall (nightfall) - 2X

When night falls, we parlayin under street lights
When night falls, the knuckleheads be lookin for the fights
In the ghetto it seems, shit never goes right
When night falls, when night falls

When night falls, your whole state of mind can change
When night fallsm the most normal shit be lookin strange
Honor roll students, they be actin deranged
When night falls, when night falls, what?

Let me tell you about the nightfall
Let me tell you about the nightfall (nightfall)</pre>
