(Step off) cause I'm lethal
(Call a ambulance)
(Call a ambulance)
(Pure energy)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Pure destruction of every MC has now been placed
On every microphone, so who dares to face
The artillery so quick to unload
My attitude is a grenade and it's time to explode
In the faces of all those who flake
Bit my ideas and used the same breaks
Toy boys are not musically inclined
The game is Scrabble, the metaphor is your mind
Track any word, any letter for anywhere
Never make sense, but suckers dont' care
Mention my name and you gots to get loose
But first take your rhymes and battle Mother Goose
In the nursery usin a fairytale book
On the mic I do knowledge clear so you look
Nervous, cause I'm about to stalk
Every rapper from Cali straight to New York
Anywhere in between, hold on to your hats
I'm removin the head of the non-right and exact
Will do what's right and proceed to start steppin
The game's do-or-die and this player's called lethal weapon

(Lethal weapon)  --&gt; Rakim

[ VERSE 2 ]
By now you realize I can't be stopped
As I endure with a score no other can top
I remained unheard until a rapper perpetrated
Made him catch a bad one, left him all lacerated
Really torn to shreds because of somethin he said
Let it happen again and he's dead
I play for keeps, the winner takes all
Extremely harmfull to each and every one of y'all
But to the righteous livin is great
Peace over war and love over hate
And when it comes to my managerial material
Biters eat it up like cereal
See how it sound before they swallow it down
Gettin so souped up that they go for my crown
How could you think like that, don't even say that
Movin on my crown, clown, I don't play that
The deadliest act that you could ever attempt
Came in with a bop and you leave with a limp
Now blame it on your homies because they let you
Get souped up, scooped up - paramedics to the rescue

[ VERSE 3 ]
Face the fact, this attack is placed on
Those on which the rhymes you hear are now based on
Victims, somebody wants you dead
You been walkin around with a price on your head
Your attitude is that you can't be beat
I was paid the price and I wrote the receipt
What's in store for you shouldn't happen to a dog
Don't even battle, just catch a cab to the morgue
There you will find a priest and a flame
On a tombstone today's date and your name
Now that's lethal

[ VERSE 4 ]
Enough with the small talk, time to avenge
You all shoulda left when you had the right chance
There's no escapin me, the doors are locked
The windows are sealed, the exits are blocked
I go non-stop, I leave no man left
A million MC's and one mega-death
I'm the weapon you slept on when you shoulda kept on
You got stepped on and your girl wept on
Her knees, beggin for mercy please
Her request denied cause I refuse to skeeze
The girl of an enemy I smell for miles
I'm true and living, that ain't my style
I meet 'em, greet 'em, beat 'em, then defeat 'em
Write 'em off in the obituaries and read 'em
Always slaughter in alphabetical order
I make life shorter for those who thought a
Wack written rhyme would be the end of my time
Are you buggin or just out of your mind?
If we haven't met yet be lucky I'm steppin
But one day you're gonna fall victim to the lethal weapon
