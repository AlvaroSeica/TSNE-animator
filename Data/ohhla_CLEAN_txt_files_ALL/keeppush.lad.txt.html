[Intro: La the Darkman]
Yeah, you know I've been doin this since I was a young'n man
Yeah word up, it's like, you know I was riding luxuses and shit
You know, Beamers and shit with 20 in rims on em, you know
Back in '97 man, you know, niggas was sayin "Yo your shit looks like a spaceship"
Nahmean

[La the Darkman]
I was twelve years old, got my first full gram
Not knowin years later nigga, I would be the man
Few years after that, I was wanted by the man
They tapped all my phones, trying to put me in the can
But I know how it be when them people after me
Straight to the DMV, got a fake ID
I don't ever be around cus I stay O.T.
I don't sell nothin less than a whole lb
I could break you off a kilo, get you that christams tree
Top grade, I got it for a reasonable fee
Come and holla at me, cus I do this for a living
I eat like everyday is Thanksgiving
I f you listen to my vision, think I'm kin to Russel Simmons
See me down in the A, fucking with them purple ribbons
I'm a BK baller, 84 inch caller
Find me a dime that I like, then I spoil her
I stick to the grain, get money, fuck the fame
I stay sucker free, cus I'm true to the game, this La

[Outro: La the Darkman]
Nahmean, yeah I have to tell you niggas man, cus sometimes,
You niggas forget, you know, real easy, know what I'm sayin?
But it's like, Landcruisers and shit like that, you know, I did that my nigga
Know what I'm sayin, we in the real estate shit now, you know, different labs n shit
You know, coppin different homes and shit
Brick houses nigga, not them paper thin ass houses
Nah mean, my house is made out of brick nigga
Nahmean, all terrain man, condos and shit man
You know, that's what it do man, you know I got the #4 Jordans on right now man
The platinum shit with the lines in it, nah mean</pre>
