[Intro: Cold 187Um]
Worldwide, we keep it jumping
From Long Beach to Compton
Death Rowwwww!! haaaaa!!

[Kurupt]
It's just another day in the hood for Kurupt, yeah, that's me
Got scooped by Snoop in a black Cherokee
Daz in the back, Warren G in the front
Nice sack of Chronic with some Gin in a cup
Back up, I stack up ends
Tha Pound and the 'Row is my only friends
If you talk shit, I hit you hard as I can
You talk shit once, but never again

[Daz Dillinger]
Well, I'm back with the bubonic Chronic sack for that ass
So all my dogs pack the bag, blaze the zags
To the fullest feeling, I'm feeling you never could feel
When your mind is calm, where your body is chill
As I mob with Tha Pound and my nigga Nate Dogg
Not flagging, not sagging, but having a ball
You saw your motherfuckers wanna see like doggs
Wanna be like doggs, but can't compare to doggs

[Kurupt]
It's like one to the two, two to the three
K-to the U-R-U-P-T
In fact, I steps with a tech in the back
In the hood, got no love, so I packs a strap
And..

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I once knew a nigga named Dr. Dre
He was a baller from the motherfucking C-P-T
He hooked up with some niggaz from the L-B-C
And now they're fucking up the whole Rap industry

[Daz Dillinger]
Well, check it out, and peep game on the one, they call Dat Nigga Daz
An O.G. from the Pound, straight putting it down for the Eastside (right)
But this is just a dove sack of dope
Sold to your ass to get smoke
Now, you can't see my motherfucking homie from the C-P-T
And you can't see my motherfucking doggs from the L-B-C

[Kurupt]
Check this flow, Hoover ain't the word to describe me
Nigga, remember, I'm murdering niggaz as a hobby
Bodies get battered, for fucking with the best 
Dogg dump with the tech-n-terror to the fucking chest 
Kurupt, do I give a fuck (hell no) I'm a loc nigga
Who you trying to provoke, nigga? step in, to get smoked nigga
Strap in the back, I'm rolling and a bumping
Niggaz talk shit, I roll right and start dumping
Uhh.. who play the role like the Gs?
Punk ass little fucking mark niggaz, please
Murder in the first degree
I step with a tech, burst and flee
You'll find none worst than me

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]

[Kurupt]
Well I see, motherfuckers murdered and mangled
Strangled, our bitches like a bangled 
Check it from a whole different angle
Bitches, I'm never symping, You'll see me pimping
I slip the clip in, bust a cap 
Watch them fall flat on their back
Like this and like that from an automatic strap
So for trying the tech, no respect I gets wrecked with a glock 
And it just don't stop
I check every nigga known, that's trying to check me
I wreck microphones verbally, respect me
I'm off to the store, to get me a four
Ohh.. so, I'm headed out the door

[Chorus: Nate Dogg X2]

[Interlude: Cold 187Um]
Yeah, and that's the way it goes down
Tha Dogg Pound, Death Rowwwww!! haaaaa!!
From Long Beach to Compton, we continue to keep it jumping
All the way across the globe
Death Rowwwww for life!! haaaaa!!

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Ushhh.. yeah, I gotta stop smoking this shit!
I should go straight..</pre>
