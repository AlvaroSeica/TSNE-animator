(*talking*)
If you going through this, this for you
Just think about it

[Chorus: Astrd Nora]
When we were together, (together)
Never thought two would become three
So now what is it over, (is it over)
This I can't believe

[K-Rino]
I got a phone call, the other night
Information, that would transform a brother's life
Off the rip, the whole vibe seemed suspect
My girl was on the phone, sounding like she was upset (whoa)
What's the matter, what's the deal
What's the problem keep it real, you can tell me how you feel
She said, well I haven't been feeling great
My friend that comes to visit every month's, a little late
I said relax, till we get it straight
The jury's still out, all we can do is chill and wait till they deliberate
She said, what about this nausea and throwing up
The more she spoke, the more the odds kept going up
Now I'm trying to get my mind right
Visions of that night, now twenty-twenty in hindsight
Feel doubt, and confusion mayn three components
Stranded in the unknown aftermath, of a heated moment

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
We only got five months, worth of daytime
Started thinking bout rumors, I heard through the grapevine
Do I really know her like I thought, peace I can't find
What if this a hustle, and this baby really ain't mine
Huh, better call my old man up
First thing he said, if it's yours you better stand up
I called mama, cause crazy I was about to go
She said don't worry, until you find out for sho'
Maybe this is a blessing, that God's showing you
Mama said if you stressing, imagine what she going through
If she is be a man, time to clear the air
Ok let me call her, better yet I'm going over there
Showed up with a EPT, she took it out the box
I stepped in the other room, cause I wasn't about to watch
Both of us stressing, anxious with a nervous heart
Showed the stick to me, plus sign in the circle part

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
We both sat down, contemplating what to do
I told her it's up to her, she told me it's up to you
Now we arguing, now our volume starting to increase
She ain't have a job, and I'm barely making my ends meet
And out of frustration, words got hostile
How I know you only been with me, and this is my child
When I said that, I saw the hurt in her eyes show
She started to cry, so hope's starting to die slow
I knew I shouldn't of took it there, that's when I started crying
Lying, if I say abortion never crossed my mind
Then my life's mission, came to me like a vision
I'm being selfish, I need to make the right decision
For all three of us, struggles come we fight back
Deadbeat and negligent, I could never be like that
We stayed up discussing it, until the break of day
Decided to have my child, and trust in God to make a way

[Chorus]

[Astrd Nora]
Holding on, gotta be strong
Holding on, is it over yeah</pre>
