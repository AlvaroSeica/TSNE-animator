Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Tell ya friends it's a wolfpack party [x2]
Bitch I'm on dat pop shit
Yes I'm a baller
I move into the hills
Eight trips worth of farness
Different kind of diamonds
All the women love me
She asked about my job
and I told her that its lovely
yes I'm famous
a celebrity
drinking crystal
clarity
tmz magazines paparazzi
barang bang tang
fuck you if you don't lyke me

Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
It's a wolfpack party [x4]

All white cooper den space shuttle
Too fly so I got ya bitch eyein

Yung giant sittin on da veteran
C da swag dat calvin letterman
Tell me who is better than 2800 Stunna Man
Catch me if you can

Hundred center fifties
We don't do da small bills
28's don't ride small wheels

Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me

Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
Making dat money bitch ima baller
Yu kno ima buy it drinks on me
It's a wolfpack party [x4]</pre>
