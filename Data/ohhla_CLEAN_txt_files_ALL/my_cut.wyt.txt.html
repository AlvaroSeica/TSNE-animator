2 door cut with flippy flop on the paint
looking like a bag of skittles that will make you wan't to faint
eyes cocked ass drop when pulled up on the set
people scard to touch my car like they might fall in and get wet
I can't keep my whip in sun for so long cause it might melt like a pack
of starburst on a summer day sitting on the shelf
I got to get her out
get her high
take her out for a ride
hopefully tonight I won't commit vehicular homicide
my cutless is clean as a fuckin whistle
Paul, and Juicy both told me I better pack pistols
pistols plural for the one's of those who do not know
I gon let these bitches rip the bay and try to take my hoe

[Chorus - 2X]
2 door cut with flip the flop like (ridin down the street smokin weed getting high)
2 door cut with flip the flop like (woooooooooooo man that fool clean)

cheech and chong up in smoke and dice on mirria
2007 cadalac space age interior
4 Pioners 4 ways across the back dash
4 12's when I come thru I'm gon break glass
and thats just the beginning
I ain't got into the engine
fuckin with gray steerin wheels I'm gripin white pearl pimpin
It's on italian leather just as icey as my soljas
pictured on the white pearl gas pedal belive I told ya
and ain't doja on me when I ride make me a blunt
aint tryin to be nobodys police when I creep the cut
they got enough on me already they don't need my car
If they won't me so bad they can find me standin in my yard

[Chorus - 2X]

It's time to talk about the muscle in this perfect creation
brand new chevy blocked and it's chromed out it will block conberation
a set of double hard heads shift kit and a kaft
flowed out with a pair of dogs hanging out the ass
brain gon and my hair blowin doin a buck 4
wow hoe if you in the road
better move yo ass out the path fast
before yo ass have to feel
20 inch spinner and 22 hundred pounds of steel
I'm a good driver but can get reckless on purple leana
pedal to the metal might hit ya and never even seen ya
take my word I put 15 G's into these souls
I'm gon flick this bitch and figurer out how to drop off 20 more

[Chorus - 4X]</pre>
