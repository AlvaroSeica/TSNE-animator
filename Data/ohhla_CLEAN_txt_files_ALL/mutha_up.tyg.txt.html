[Intro]
Okay man, are you ready to go?
  I'm ready to go, now c'mon now
  Crank this motherfucker up!

[Tyga]
Ha ha... Young Money... AHH~!
Y.M., C.M.B., rawest niggaz doing it
School for the blind, I don't see these niggaz doin it
I'm doin it and doin it and doin it well
Niggaz wanna test me boy, who wanna fail?
Hit you like a bully bitch, yeah saved by the bell
If you scared, go to church, I'll see you in Hell
And your girl, she a flip, give me heads or tails
Everybody fake so I got real for sale
Gu-gunpowder fill the air
Rappers shittin' on theyself, you could smell the fear
And these bitches layin flowers cause the king is near
T-Raw this is the new +Flava In Ya Ear+
Niggaz softer than baby hair
Why you actin tough? Heard you work at Build-a-Bear
I'ma a dealer, all my girls come in deuce and pairs
I'm in the buildin, I construct so {"crank this motherfucker up"}
W-w-w-w-what the funk you beezy's want?
I'm ready to +Hump+ the car I call it +Elephunk+, the trunk in the front
Man she give me good brain cause she feel dumb
I just keep goin like the bunny 'til I feel numb
Yeah these bitches want it, I put my mans on it
That 110 Sup' and that Ferrari Caliornia
Ni-niggaz want beef, ca-call me Tony Romo
You potatoes on the sofa... ha ha ha
Lazy motherfuckers why you ain't even try yet?
+Rich or Die Tryin+ why you niggaz ain't died yet?
Wings tattoo, yeah forever on some fly shit
And I'm with the business, skip PYOOM with a iey clip
Stay on the flight, yeah I'ma trip
Probably up in paradise, chillin like Parliaments
Flow got a boner, you could say I'm on some harder shit
'Bout to make the speaker buss {"crank this motherfucker up!"}

[Chorus: repeat and chop sample]
{"Crank this motherfucker up!"}

[Nicki Minaj]
Oh-oh-okay really I get money I get money like a biiitch
She ain't gon' no-whurr, but I swear that bitch a triiip
Yeah! You see how them diamonds get to dancin
Ehhh! Yeah your money short, get some pants and shit
I be with a nigga with a big ol' dick
Yeah I like them balls, you be shootin them bricks
Fuck you in the game fo'?
Bitch we up three sippin this game fo'
Tell 'em listen, couple bad bitcheses
Out in Kingston, kickin up bricks and shit
Intervention, bitch I pay your pension
Oh you sayin WHAT?! I don't pay attention
Y-y-y-y-yeah these niggaz want it, I put my bitches on it
You know the tattoo's got Nicki initials on it
I put the pussy on 'em, cook 'em a pot roast
Then pull off in the Ghost, b-b-bitch I do the most

[Tyga]
What the funk you beezies want? It ain't your turn
Better have my money +Friday+ like +Big Worm+
Can't see you niggaz, you like a little germ
Bitches know I'm "egg-scellent," like +Mr. Burns+
See my dick like butter churn
Baby churn and your girl with me fo'shure, that ain't your concern
She forgot about her other man, she will never learn
On a mic till I die, R.I.P. chick her
Ye-yessir, colder than a Pittsburgh win-TER
Fresher than a +Will Smith+ t-shirt
These spurs comin through, Last King in a hearse
Ask later, shoot first, got shooters like dirt
Winnin hurts, leave you losers bruised up
Bruce Lee nunchucks, to' from the floor up
Go duck, rubber duck, now you like "Oh shucks"
Tell the neighbors I don't give a fuck {"crank this motherfucker up"}

[Chorus]</pre>
