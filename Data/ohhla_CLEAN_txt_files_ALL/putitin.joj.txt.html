[Intro: JoJo Pellegrino]
Mobbed out heads
Project heads (Yea)
Guerilla killahs
Up north Illa's (Yea)
Yea, it's for real (Take ya time wit' it)
I know ya feel us
Yea, we put it down

[JoJo Pellegrino]
I get it poppin' mami
See theirs a new kid on the block
and it ain't Jordan, Joey, Danny, Donnie or Markie
His names J.J.P., that's what they call him for short
JoJo Pellegrino in its entirety
"Hitman for Hire", like fuck them fools at the label
I told Violator lip-service don't put food on my table
So now I'm out, takin' a different route
Let me show you what this Mafioso shit is all about
They know they hid the truth, they knew it's raw
and I'ma get through the door, win, lose, or draw
They gossip and slander, and doggin' me off
And that's promotion, who cares what they saying, as long as they talkin'
Give me an emcee as ill as me and I'm finding 'em
Pac, Biggie, Nas caliber so stop signing 'em
Staten supreme, hit the scene wit' a live stylist
Been a long time but I pen a strong rhyme, the time's now

[Chorus: JoJo Pellegrino]
Fake cats talk about it
Real heads put it in motion
True to this hustle, we making it happen
Yo, on everything I love I'm making it rappin'
Code of the streets, supply to this game
We taking and snatching
Mob ties, I got 'em
Wit the hood, I'm rockin'
Up north, they bobbin'
Number one question, when is he dropping?
'Cause ain't nobody do it like this
Pellegrino put it down around town
Burbs to the Bricks, what!

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Yo, this shit is real
How the fuck you gonna talk about emcees on my heel?
Chill, ya killin' me
Pelle murder these rappers lyrically
I don't approach tracks timidly
You could tell by this sincerity in my delivery
I got the Burbs hoping, I keep the slums open, guns smokin'
Haters get to hoppin' like ya jump-roping
I'm not to be played with
I'm cocky and flagrant
This is more than just some fine entertainment
Live from The Bassment, gotta' be patient
Although I'm starving, it's time and I feel it coming
The stars is aligning, I paid my dues, I made my moves
To the death constantly show and prove
Them girls is sewing dudes
They want a man wit' hair on his chest to dick 'em to death
You boys are so confused
and streets is taking its toll, but its only making me grow
Basically Joe'sÂ… focus on his goals

[Chorus]

[JoJo Pellegrino]
Check it out..
Look, lets roll
Got like ten albums worth of hot shit
Lets pick the illest sixteen and lets go
Let's blow, the streets is fiending
They fucked with me hard
So DJ's should be ashamed of yourself if ya not leaning
And I'm not leaving, fresh off the block scheming
Plots steaming, pinch yaself, ya not dreaming
This is more than clever rapping
What's up wit you up-and-comers?
Everything you talk has never happened
Really, I doubt ya gutter (get 'em!)
Every last word ya spit, it go in one ear and out the other
I'm my own favorite emcee, rappers is wack lyrically
Real recognize real, you pricks look unfamiliar to me
This here my lively hood
I'm well respected from the Burbs to the livest hoods
Projects to Hollywood
I'm in mode, a diamond in a mind full of coal
This is Pellevision, slash GWE, lets roll!

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
