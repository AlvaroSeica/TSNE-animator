[Rick Ross]
Uh, let's pull the two-seater out baby
It's wherever you want to go
Rozay!

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele] + (Drake)
Riding to the music
This is how we do it, all night
Racing down the freeway
Just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the
Aston Martin music, music
(Would've came back for you, I just needed time
 to do what I had to do, caught in the life
 I can't let it go, whether that's right
 I won't ever know
 Uh, but here goes nothing)

[Rick Ross]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside, getting it in on the road
Lot of quiet time, pink bottles of Rose
Exotic red-bottom sole, body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals, I'm following in a rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
My money triple up when you get it out of state
Need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson, I'm somewhere out of space
In my two-seater, she the one that I will take, we

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Pull up on the block in a drop-top kicking box
Mister KFC, VVS is in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, she take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down, right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
I dig her like pookie, that pussy be controlling me
That thang keep calling
Fuck maintain, boy I gotta keep BALLING!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coup pop-clutch, one hundred

[Chorus]

[Chrisette Michelle]
Aston Martin music, music
Aston Martin music, music
Aston Martin music, music
Aston Martin music, music
In our ride
Aston Martin music, music
Aston Martin music, music
In our ride </pre>
