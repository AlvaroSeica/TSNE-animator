[2Pac talking]
(Laughs) We're going platinum nigga, we going platinum

[2Pac]
Yeah, you got the Live Squad in this motherfucker
We get my nigga Treach from Naughty By Nature up in this motherfucker

[Stretch]
My nigga Apache up in this motherfucker

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
My Mossberg goes boom, gimmie room, can I catch it?
Talking quick and then I vic just trying to keep from getting blasted
I had enough I put a hit upon them bastards
Booyaa, turned his Benz into a casket
Now they're after me, prowling for a nigga's bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Buck, buck, big up and living reckless
Niggas with a death wish step in with a Teck and I'll wet this
Yeah, this shit is hyper
True to what I'm writing representing and I'm striking like a viper
I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm and strong arm must run
Some niggas need to feel me with a passion
I'm old fashioned, run up on me nigga and get blasted
With five deadly venoms

[Stretch talking]
Yeah Pac, fuck that, still hittin em off with that old deadly shit
Aiyyo Treach where you at?
Step up and hit they ass up with the wickedness

[Verse 2: Treach]
We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
To the onyx of your nose, punk is funky like a skunk blunts
Stunk like a funk cunt
I come to take you on a war rough and rugged route
And if another doubts I blow your fuckin' mother out
And that's the street scarred style
I shout "I'm the MC with the nasty mouth" and kick the bitch out
Sue me? I pay the lawyer for ya, oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to 20 fucking pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya picking shit
Picking pockets with a razor stopping Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm lifting shop
Once you sound hot, 'cause if you ain't a perfect ten
My sign is stop
It's 20 mother crooked fucking styles in 'em
Like women I did 'em I'm in for deadly ready venom

[Verse 3: Majesty]
Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, big Maj
The Thuggadon king, I come tougher
See I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom
Breaking 'em down, I make 'em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam
It's a job to rob and steal and runnin' from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac 11 blaster and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fucking bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make you scatter, leaving trails of brains and bladders
Blowing 'em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, something that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit 'em, I lit him
He's out, a poison, a deadly venom

[Stretch talking]
Yeah Maj, fuck that, you know how we do, know what I'm saying,
The Squad's in effect, YGz in effect
Now you know a nigga like me's gotta represent
You know what I'm sayin'?
Check it out

[Verse 4: Stretch]
Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head, G, check the melody
Niggas can't touch me when I wrecking, G, you better flee
'Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a 44 Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Boom, you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah, one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking over eight niggas back to the stomping grounds
Line 'em up single file, dome running in 'em
A nigga hit 'em with the venom
the fourth deadly venom

[Stretch talking]
Nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin?  Fuck that!
I told you, we takin over, yo 'Pac

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
Five deadly venoms verse five be the livest
Struggling and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggas don't even worry me, see
I got a glock that says Pac run the block
Fuck the cops 'cause my gauge gets me, paid
As I sit and reminisce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggas need to get their minds right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on, everday could be my last day
That's why I blast on their ass as I past let the glass spray
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now your mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffing blunts
Deadly venoms

[Stretch talking]
Haha, yeah pass that shit over here
Apache about to clean shit up!

[Verse 6: Apache]
Throw up your middle finger
Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin' out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell you how rough I get
I pop shit behind your back, get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger, I'm a snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fucking trigger
I'm a section to clinch your Porche is like a pinch
Test a rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
Fucking up pooh butts, cut 'em like cold cuts
Choke 'em with my boot lace, then leave 'em hangin like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get 'em
That's the results of fucking with the fifth venom in denim

[Outro: Stretch]
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
Five motherfucking deadly venoms,
in effect for '93, '94, '95, all that other shit,
We taking this motherfucker over this larger hit
you know what I'm saying?
Follow us, come along,
you know what I'm saying?
We taking this motherfucker over
Trust, we out</pre>
