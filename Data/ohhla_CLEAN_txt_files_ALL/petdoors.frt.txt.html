Fort Minor, we major...

[Chorus One]
Y'all are not not r-ready (no!) not r-ready (no!)
We about to drop it steady (so!)
Do it like that, like that, like that
Do it like that, like that, like that

[Chorus Two: repeat 2X]
Now why is everybody so petrified? (what?)
Petrified (what?) step aside
And just drop that (c'mon!) drop that (c'mon!)
Drop that (c'mon!) drop that (c'mon!)

[Mike Shinoda]
Yeah... how you doin y'all, my name's Mike
I'm fluent with the new shit, I'm doin it all night
I like what I do, I do what I like
I could quit and get it back like I'm ridin a bike
Like stop - bring it back, bring it back

How you doin y'all, my name's Mike
I'm fluent with the new shit, I'm doin it all night
I like what I do, I do what I like
I could quit and get it back like I'm ridin a bike
Like stop - bring it bring it back, bring it back
We got that balance keepin us on track
that you get when you move and quit with no slow
You stare like you don't care but you do though
I know, you really must be so lonely
Puffed up like you tough, but so phony
You and your boys you don't know me
You really wanna hold me? Show me, homie
Let's get it over with for good
I got a friction addiction I wish you would
Machine Shop rockin when we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

[Chorus Two] - 1/2X

[Mike Shinoda]
Listen, you are not, ready
Like children in a buildin you can't stand steady
It must be the beat's so heavy
causin panic attacks like a crack in the levee
Give you that Robert Plant, "Dancing Days" are back
Feelin all in the track and in fact
For those knowin the name, I'm back
with some brand new crack who can do it like - that
You really must be so lonely
Puffed up like you tough, but so phony
You and your boys you don't know me
You really wanna hold me? Show me, homie
Tough talk doesn't mean a thing
Get over yourself, you know when we're up in a scene
It's Machine Shop rockin when we step inside
And we got everybody so petrified

[Chorus Two]

[Chorus One] Â– 2X

[Mike] Get up

[Chorus Two]

[Mike Shinoda]
Like stop (stop) bring it back (bring it back)
We got that balance keepin us on track
Like stop (stop) bring it back (bring it back)
We got that balance keepin us on track
Like stop - bring it bring it back (bring it back)
We got that balance keepin us on track
Like stop - bring it bring it back (bring it back)
We got that balance keepin us on track
Like stop...</pre>
