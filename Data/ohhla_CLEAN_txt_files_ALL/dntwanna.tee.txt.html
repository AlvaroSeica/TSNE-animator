[Chorus: T.I.]
Ay, hey don't you wanna be hiiiiigh?
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride get high with me
Ay, ay, I know you wanna be hiiiiigh
You never wanna say bye to me, if you ever come fly with me
Ay, hey don't you wanna be hiiiiigh?
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride get high with me
Ay, ay, I know you wanna be hiiiiigh
Promise you'll never say bye to me, and if you ever get high with me
Let's go
 
[T.I.]
Okay the bucket's on tilt, truck is on stilts
Just did another deal today, at least a couple mil'
And I'm askin you to chill, wanna pass that down?
I'm tryin to pick you up and never put ya ass back down
Get rid of all your worries, why you draggin that around?
Here, pop one of these, now pass that around
Fire it up, take a shot, now ya ass in the clouds
Can I bend you over? Throw your ass back down
No need sayin no, we way past that now
I ain't them other niggaz, just control the flashback now
Make three wishes, you can have that now
And fuck the financin, payin cash right now
Ay, miracle man make dreams come true
Take a ride, get high, 'bout the time you come to
I bet your life done changed, you likin my last name
Done had a couple babies with a Bentley and a Range
Crib on the water, eatin meals on a plane
And your life in the sky like you lived on a plane
With so much good shit to fill yo' brain
If the band seem strange I'm just sayin
 
[Chorus]
 
[T.I.]
You see me, chillin out kickin back in the ride
With a, fly broad on the passenger side
Got a, nice smile and immaculate eyes
Before she, get inside she don't have to decide
Cause she can have it how she want it, we can do it like that
And then I went and threw it to her and she threw it right back
She said nobody never gave it to her like that
Hit it from the back, I figure you would like that
Her head and tight pussy good like that
And damn, she ain't even from the hood like that
So she probably never really kicked it with a cool nigga
Other niggaz had her didn't know what to do with her
Intimidated by her face and her cute figure
Cause her waist real small but her ass way bigger
Hope she know that if I want her I ain't finna play wit her
All I gotta do is spend a day with her
 
[Chorus]
 
[T.I.]
Hey, hey what it is pretty girl, would you like to
come and kick it with a nigga for a night or two?
And you can take your clothes off if you like to
And it don't matter 'bout the cost if I like you
I just do it shorty, I ain't gotta try to
Bust a move, bet ya I can satisfy you
And me chase right behind you, why boo?
I'm like you, know you fly but I'm fly too
You know how I do it, always ride good
Match the paint with the wheel, put the trunk in the hood
You dealin with a real nigga, get it understood
I'm still from the hood, even when in Hollywood
With my beat down low and my top let back
You lookin for a G, well you got just that
Hey I can be your king, you can be my princess
Baby all you gotta do is say yes
