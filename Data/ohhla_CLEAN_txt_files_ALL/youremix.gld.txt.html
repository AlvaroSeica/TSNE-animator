[Intro]
I, I-I-I {*3X*}
I {*boom boom boom boom*}

[Santigold]
Go ahead, you know you want it
You'll have no other way you just want to take us down
Go ahead, I'll be the one hit
If I can take you boy it just might throw this town
Oh oh oh! You want to get it
You make us bleed, it'll prove there's life somewhere
And oh no! I want to yell it
But do we speak or are we just noddin our heads?

[Chorus 1]
No way, not me
What you got, it's not for me
But you'll find a way no way, not me
What you got, it's not for me

[Chorus 2: repeat 2X]
Don't reach too far; you will fall over
Don't be surprised what you discover
Don't fear your call; can't pull us under
You better watch out, run for cover

{*OVER from the last line REPEATS RAPIDLY*}

[Santigold]
Go ahead, I'll be your junkie
I'll be deplete, you can heap all rubbish here
Go ahead, now dump it on me
If I go quiet will the itch go down with me?
Oh oh oh! You got to get it
Never mind that it was never there nowhere
But oh no-oh! Not for a minute
For now you'll make your bed and it will wait I swear

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

{*OVER from the last line REPEATS RAPIDLY*}

[Santigold: repeat 2X]
Tell them that they'll get what they wanted, tell them
Tell them that they'll get what they wanted; 'til then</pre>
