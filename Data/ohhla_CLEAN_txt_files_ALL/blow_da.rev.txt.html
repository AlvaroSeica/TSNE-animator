"Blow da spot" - Redman 'Funkorama'

[Intro]
Can I get your attention please?
I want everybody to come to the front of the club
and wile out to this shit right here

[Krondon talking]
You already know what it is. Nigga, Krondon
Yellowface, Revolution, Strong Arm Steady Gang. Heard dat
Get ready

[Verse One] [Krondon]
You got a millionaire mouth piece 
Broke nigga bank account
Let's see him eat without teeth
Swallowin' a porterhouse
Niggas get your order out
Servin' hot two for one gunshots
The legend that the little niggas heard about
In and out of luxury
Auto mobility
Luckily I keep the fully auto tucked on me
Niggas that I don't trust approach me humbly
Really ain't much to discuss, I'm no dummy
The root of evil is the love of money
Not money
The people things do when hungry
Niggas rather chase the honey and act all out monkey
Ape shit, fuckin' up the country
Steady make the hits till the tires fall off the Hummy
Play the cards till I'm drunk
Gin Rummy
Revolution make the beat to bang like Cash Money
And he knows who's the hardest artist nigga

[Chorus]
Strong Arm Steady blowin' up the spot
Blao! 
Put your hands up, everybody come to the front
Whassup? 
I need y'all to get up
Put your hands up
My niggas in the back, stand up
"Turn it up"
Ayo
Strong Arm Steady blowin' up the spot
Blao! 
Put your hands up, everybody come to the front
Whassup? 
I need y'all to get up
Put your hands up
My niggas in the back, stand up
Raise the roof up

[Phil talking]
Whassup? Everybody get up
Whassup? Everybody get up
Strong Arm Steady
Whassup?
Strong. Arm. Steady. Niggas

[Verse Two] [Phil Da Agony]
Ayo, who's the boss? It's not me
So we'll blast ya, go ahead and cop plea
But I'ma be gettin' off scott free
X to the Z? That's the homie so stop askin' me
My whole objective is to sell records like Master P
Askin' me about Kweli 
While I was performin' in Raleigh, Durham
You was on the block hittin' sherm
With a perm like Big Worm
If you ain't pimpin' like Suga Free
Send in that hoe, holla at Mitchy
Pop my collar right here, itchy
Very +Superstitious+ like Stevie
+It's Tricky+ like Run-DMC
To grab the mic, dizzy, you right
We the best to do it
Tell the motherfuckers, get with the movement
Yeah that
We maxin' out
Drug dealin' killers pullin' packs out
Money makin' amount
Honey's waxin' out
Strong Arm Institution
We blastin' out with Revolution

[Chorus]
Strong Arm Steady blowin' up the spot
Blao! 
Put your hands up, everybody come to the front
Whassup? 
I need y'all to get up
Put your hands up
My niggas in the back, stand up
"Turn it up"
Ayo
Strong Arm Steady blowin' up the spot
Blao! 
Put your hands up, everybody come to the front
Whassup? 
I need y'all to get up
Put your hands up
My niggas in the back, stand up
Raise the roof up

[Mitchy talking]
Strong Arm Steady, Krondon, Phil Da Agony, Mitchy Slick is already the same
Red and blue make green so get your bars up or get broke off ya bitch ass nigga
I've been ready. Yeah.

[Verse Three] [Mitchy Slick]
Uh, San Diego
Tatted on my forearm
I'm a tecanina bringa and I clack for the Strong Arm
No harm
Intended, that's just how we mash
See us comin', don't bleed on the sidewalk
But cut your ass
Cause if the ? son tension buildin'
I'm stealin'
We rearded niggas worth millions but still with the killin'
Third eye completely on G shit
Cross the gang and you're gonna need your check and your teeth fixed
Cause we hit like Jeep and red boy mixed
Bred to be dead game
Don't scratch, won't quit
All them extras, boats 
Harley bikes
Got everything pimp like diamond studded gauntlet
On my aunt's sis
I'm with the bizness
In the same profession as my nigga J. Diggs is
For the S.A.S. trib is a way of livin'
That's why a S.A.S. sits in whatever driven

[Chorus]
Ayo
Strong Arm Steady blowin' up the spot
Blao! 
Put your hands up, everybody come to the front
Whassup? 
I need y'all to get up
Put your hands up
My niggas in the back, stand up
"Turn it up"
Ayo
Strong Arm Steady blowin' up the spot
Blao! 
Put your hands up, everybody come to the front
Whassup? 
I need y'all to get up
Put your hands up
My niggas in the back, stand up
Raise the roof up
