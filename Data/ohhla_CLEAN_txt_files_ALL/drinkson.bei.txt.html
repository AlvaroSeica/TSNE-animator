Let's go

They know my name at the bar
Go so hard
One swipe of the card
Drinks on me
Drinks on me
(Girl you know you know it's all on me)
They know my name at the bar
Baby I'ma star
One swipe of the card
Drinks on me
Drinks on me

I'm in the club like bottles on me
Long as y'all drinkin'
Baby girl tell me what you sippin', sippin'
Tell me what it is I'll get it, get it
Ain't been this buzzed in a minute, minute

I'm dressed so fresh gotta brush myself off
And baby girl dancin' like a stripper, stripper
She looks so good I could kiss, kiss her
I'm all in the air tryna whisper, shh like...
Baby what you gonna do with all that girl
Lemme get close, lemme get up in there
Come home to my crib, she was like yeah
Next thing you know she ridin' with a millionaire

All the girls in the club goin' crazy
All the girls in the club goin' crazy
What your friends want, want,
What they, what they sippin'
Let me and Trey know we'll get it, get it

They know my name at the bar
Go so hard
One swipe of the card
Drinks on me
Drinks on me
(Girl you know you know it's all on me)
They know my name at the bar
Baby I'ma star
One swipe of the card
Drinks on me
Drinks on me

I go so hard, so hard, so ha-a-a-ard
Yeah they know my name at the ba-ba-ba-bar
Ballin' in the club we a-a-a-are
All these bottles are-a-a-ah
(I go so hard)
I go so hard, so hard, so ha-a-a-ard
Yeah they know my name at the ba-ba-ba-bar
Ballin in the club we a-a-a-are
All the bottles are-a-a-ah

Excuse my manners
But can I touch your booty
I'm sorry baby girl I been sippin', sippin'
So I apologize if I'm trippin', trippin'
But you look so pretty, you glisten and listen

I-I ain't never seen nobody quite like you
Ain't sh-t wrong you perfect, perfect
Drinkin' all my money you worth it, worth it
And don't feel bad you deserve it

I get you anything you like
Get your night of your life
Baby lemme spoil you
Spend it all on you
Baby don't check the price
Cause it's all for you tonight
Whoa

They know my name at the bar
Go so hard
One swipe of the card
Drinks on me
Drinks on me
(Girl you know you know it's all on me)
They know my name at the bar
Baby I'ma star
One swipe of the card
Drinks on me
Drinks on me

I go so hard, so hard, so ha-a-a-ard
Yeah they know my name at the ba-ba-ba-bar
Ballin' in the club we a-a-a-are
All these bottles are-a-a-ah
(I go so hard)
I go so hard, so hard, so ha-a-a-ard
Yeah they know my name at the ba-ba-ba-bar
Ballin' in the club we a-a-a-are
All the bottles are-a-a-ah

I go so hard
At bar
We are...

I ain't never seen nobody quite like you
Ain't sh-t wrong you perfect, perfect
Drinkin' all my money you worth it...</pre>
