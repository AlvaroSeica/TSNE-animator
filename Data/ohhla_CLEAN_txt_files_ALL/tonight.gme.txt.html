[Chorus: Mele] + (Game)
(We gon' need some ladies tonight!)

And we got so many cars, we goin shoppin for days
Everybody goin cra'y, we gon' party for weeks
I said this money never sleeps and
(We gon' need some ladies tonight!)
Cause we got too much Spades
And we got so many cars, we goin shoppin for days
Everybody goin cra'y, we gon' party for weeks
I said this money never sleeps and
(We gon' need some ladies tonight!)
We gon' need some ladies tonight
We gon' need some ladies tonight
We gon' need some ladies tonight
We gon' need some ladies tonight
Comin home with me baby - yeah

[Game]
I said I do I do I do I do I do, you know I do
Red Phantom, peanut butter guts, Winnie the Pooh
And you know I got that honey with me, Playboy bunny with me
She got a Kevin Hart, always actin funny with me
Say she far from perfect, but I love her though
And I would love her even if she was a undercover hoe
Know she killin that thang for me, know she movin that ass
She got kids but that's her past, tip my hat and tilt my glass
I ain't focused on her flaws, I'm just focused on her drawers
I compliment her, rather that than not get no pussy at all
She love the niggaz that rat, she hate the niggaz that ball
I'm 'bout to have a castin call and

[Chorus]

[Game]
How many women in the club got a 9-to-5?
Ain't had a break in days, know you need that glass of Spades
Girl you know I got it for you, know I got more than one
And we gon' make that nigga jealous when that photo done
So take that picture girl, just make sure you smile
And text your baby-sitter, cause you know we gon' be a while
And we can do whatever, go to M-I-A and chill
You tryin to travel, stay with him I bet you never will
And hell naw he ain't tryna lose you, cause the head is real
And all he wanna do is go in circles like a ferris wheel
That nigga sellin dreams, I got a better deal
So girl come with me

[Chorus]

[Mele]
Fuck with me cause I done ordered all these bottles for ya
(Bottles for ya) Oooooh
You should fuck with me cause I'm blowin all this money on ya
(Money on ya) Yeah
Baby fuck with me cause I done ordered all these bottles for ya
(Bottles for ya) Oooooh
Baby fuck with me cause I'm blowin all this money on ya
Yeahhhhhh yeah~! Ohhhhh

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro: Mele]

I said you're comin home with me babe
So fuck that nigga (fuck that)
Tonight, tonight, yeah yeah
