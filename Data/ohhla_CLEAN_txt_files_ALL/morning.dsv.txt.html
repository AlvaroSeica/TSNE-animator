[Intro]
It's a fly love song {*2X*}

[D-Sisive]
Where did all the stars go?
Not a single one showin off sparkles
Swimmin in the charcoal, sky, it's morning in Barcelona
Windows open, the sun came in to say
Hi, good morning miss sleepyhead
Silent, we stare at each other
Smiling, I fight not to blink
I don't want to miss a thing like Steven Tyler sings
I serenade you somethin softly
"When a Man Loves a Woman," off key
Before I met you, I couldn't really tell you
what that song means, now every lyric's crystal - clear
And all I wanna do is kiss you - here
And here, and there
And I'm going to but wait one sec
I don't mean to change the subject, but
Ay

[Chorus]
I was wondering can I
Can I know you forever like
For the rest of my life
But that might not be long enough, no
I wanna tell you good morning
One sleep after I tell you good night
For the rest of my life
But that might not be long enough, no

[D-Sisive]
I'm sorry if I'm comin off ficeps
But life's way too short to be pipsqueak
And you're way too gorgeous to forfeit
I need to see you tomorrow morning, plus
Tomorrow's tomorrow morning
And so on and so on until I so long
It's morning in Barcelona
And I don't ever wanna wake up not beside you
Tell me, how did a nickel like me
get a dime like you, it doesn't make - cents
Get it? Don't giggle at my line
Your feet must be sore from sprinting through my, mind
Not impressed? Really I don't blame you
I'm just tryin to entertain you
Before you realize that you're out of my league
and make your train choo, choo, choose, you
I, and...

[Chorus]</pre>
