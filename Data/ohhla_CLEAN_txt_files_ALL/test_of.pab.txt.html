It won't until i was dead broke and about to go crazy 
Half a tank of gas, two cigerattes
scraping up change in an ashtray.
Had a voice said,
it's only a test of my faith.
It was only..............

    (Verse 1)

Damn,
this song for dat nigga south,
that I was tellin y'all bout.
Y'all check dis nigga shit out
Remember the song i told you came on sound like,
how he was at a point on his own,
and the promblems seem to be takin a toll 
that he been fightin for so long.
Seemed like erthang he did went wrong,
But he found the strength to keep on goin.
And wrote  songs about it later on.
You know that shit hit me home,
especially when he would talk about the money he owed.
How he took the bills andhe  payed somethin on each one.
Like he put sometin on his light bill,
somethin on his phone.
He'll get a lil money,
and he'd pay a lil mo.
He aint have a lot so he just payed what he could on it.
And somehow he just managed to keep all this stuff goin.
It wont nothin but the grace of the Lord,
Cuz I remember 
I was............

    (Chorus)

It won't until i was dead broke and about to go crazy 
Half a tank of gas, two cigerattes
scraping up change in an ashtray.
Had a voice said,
it's only a test of my faith.
It was only..............
 
    (Verse 2)

So it seemed ertime he got himself off the ground,
somethin'd come and knock him right back down.
Sometimes he wanted to just lay on out for the count,
fustrated and tired,
but he got on up anyhow.
And wit a smile I'm talkin bout.
Make you ask yourself "How?"
And then Cuz just  broke it down for me he said....

(Singing and Pablo talkin in the background)
I aint neva been dis happy in my life.
Ain't got a dime more then i had.
But everything seems alright.
And they say he aint know...
Havin the joy of a piece of mind
is more than any problem i ever had at the time.
And now I know and I'm so glad.

It was only
a sign of the tide.
It was only
askin me why should i cry.
It was only
Singing be glad your alive today.
Only a test of my faith.

    (Pablo)

Man that boy can sing that song.
Play this shit ermorning,
just ta get my lil day goin.
You just don't know how this had touched my soul to find out i wont da only 
one that been through somethin.
Almost the exact same somethin,
was eatin me up.
Knew what it was, 
just could'nt put it in words.
I aint neva been the type to really talk to nobody
so all the problems that i had,
I just kept em all inside.
Y'all had enough of ya own
 to worry bout,
the lil situation i had goin on.
But you know God wont let you suffer too long.
I aint even had da radio on,
I was out on the porche,
den Boom.
From the Heavens above,
just when I was at that point,
when I was just about to mess up,
Man Buda played this song fo me cuz and i just shook my head like 
"uh uh uh"

    (Chorus)
It was only
a sign of the tide.
It was only
askin me why should i cry.
It was only
Singing be glad your alive today.
Only a test of my faith.</pre>
