[TJ singing]
Yeah, Yeahhhh, Ohhh
Oh, Ohhhhhhhhh
Oh, Uhhhhhhhhh, Ohh

[Verse 1: Storm]
I was once a little girl with the same mind
Quick to holla at a nigga with the same line
I had a little .22 just to back me up
For them suckas on my block that be acting up
I heard brenda had a baby and that's real nice
Until Brenda turned crazy and took that life
Now I'm strugglin' with these words tryin' to understand
Cause I was Brenda's little baby breathin' again
Now tell me who do you believe in cause life goes on
It's just me against the world, run the streets alone
With these crooked ass niggas I see death around the corner
Lord knows it aint easy tradin' war stories
Point the finger open fire I'm an outlaw
Only god can judge me If my homies call
Holla at me heaven aint hard to find
Got my mind made up against all odds

[Chorus: TJ]
Listen...
A penny for your thoughts, please
You can be a millionaire
But there'll Neva B no one quite like you
You're so sare, rare

[Verse 2: Storm]
First it was all about you now all eyes on me
So Imma bomb first fuck the world they can't see me
Guess who's back the rebel of the underground
With a thug passion something wicked to live and die
In L.A. when we ride the streets is deathrow
So many tears no more pain for lost souls
Dear mama you were just like daddy
But I aint mad at ya cause ya never wanted to have me
Wonder why they call you bitch cause you scandalous
But I will never call you bitch again that's blasphemy
Temptation got me trapped in this white man's World
Fair exchange I'm taking back everything they owe
Don't make enemies with me cause life is hell for a hustla
I'm getting money worldwide uppercuttin' these bustas
Fake ass bitches fuck all y'all cradle to the grave
Give my letter to the president tell him make it better days

[Chorus: TJ]
Listen...
A penny for your thoughts, please
You can be a millionaire
But there'll Neva B no one quite like you
You're so sare, rare

[Verse 3: Storm]
They don't give a fuck about us this life I lead
This aint livin' shorty wanna be a thug for real
I got a million dollar spot hennessy and weed
Strictly for my niggas never had a friend like me
I stay high till I die god bless the dead
Hail mary for a hellrazor hold ya head
How long will they morn me If I die tonite
I'm runnin' on e starin' through my rearview light
They say the good die young but what about a bastard
Same song thug style teardrops and closed caskets
Letter to my unborn last words to my seed
In the event of my demise baby don't cry please
Shit don't stop that's just the way it is tattoo tears
To my closest road dog still heavy in the game
Are you still down?, down, down...

[Chorus: TJ]
Are you still down, down for me, yeah
A penny for your thoughts, please
You can be a millionaire
But there'll Neva B no one quite like you
Oh no, you're so sare, rare

[Outro: TJ singing]
There will Neva B Neva Neva B
There will Neva B no oh oh oh
Oh, There Will Neva B neva neva neva neva neva
Neva neva neva neva neva Neva B
Neva Be no one Neva Be no one
Neva Be no no no one, no one quite like you
You... You...</pre>
