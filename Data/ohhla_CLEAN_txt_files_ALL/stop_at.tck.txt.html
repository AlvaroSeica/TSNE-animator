[Hook - 2x]
Stop at the light, the rims still go
Limo tint, but the grill still show
Mob through the lot, with the suicide do'
Color change whoa, 24's on that hoe

[Big Tuck]
Rims so big, I can see in a diesel
Sitting so high, think I can grab me a eagle
The shine in the mouth, I don't think that it's legal
Got the black Vesal, purchase on me Visa
Bapes on the pedal, candy on the metal
The man with the cheddar, red monkeys on the leather
Stones on the finger, Lam on the beamer
Fuck rain in the club, I make it Hurricane Katrina
Make it pour heavy, book a flight from the celly
28's on a Cheve, one bitch thought I was Nelly
Naw Tuck, I get's buck
First nigga in the city, 7-45 truck

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Tuck]
Yeah, you ain't stunting like me
The black Lamborgini, you ain't running like me
200 karats, you ain't glisten like me
Hurricane Tuck, putting it down for the D
Yeah, I'm gonna do what it take
For me and the click, to go surf in a lake
We repping, real hard for the state
Toasting mamostas, let's go get the cake
D.S.R. Pookie, Lucci got the city hot
That's why, we floating the same plane Diddy got
Let me tell you, what they talking bout
Flying to Japan, fans hands when we step out

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Tuck]
Yeah, let me tell you some'ing real
The whole click grill chill, waited for the deal
We still, fighting for the bill
Tuck's in the building, what's the god damn deal
Move, coming through coming through
Wreck the Ferrari, then I went and bought two
Cocaine white, but it changed up to blue
I ain't never had nothing, let me do what I do
Put the forces, on the throttle
Step in the club, like I just won the lotto
Find, the genie in the bottle
She a model, and I can't lose it's the motto
