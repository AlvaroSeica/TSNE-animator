Scary as a Rare rash
I show up right before the crash like an airbag
But it still hurts, snapping like a bear trap spit an ill verse
Watch my stock rise like aircraft
Mega Ran is the man with the Iron fist
kept it digital, cause ain't nobody buying discs
Get a copy Cuz rappers are gettin sloppy
Do the math, cause my path is fibonacci
I been a beast bro, lax to heathrow
What do he know this rap is a freethrow
To ray Allen, boy are they whylin
Went diggin for a problem and they found him(hook)

River city Rhymin
Wit precise timing
You don't want a problem
Cuz we all ridin
You might hear the sirens
All we see is violence
So Get inside its
River city rhymin

Get em, hit em

Beat em
Make it rough

got em bracing for Impact
Made a stack off the Lin rap and never been back
Yet, now they clamor for a title shot
They just browsing...Firefox
If you hadnt noticed I write a lot
All aboard and I'm on till the final stop
I got bills to pay so my Grind don't stop
(what do you know?) How much time you got?
Me? I dont have time for you losers
I bruise ya for calling me a rhyming producer
Got a tough shell as if I was a Koopa
I wrote the book
Call me Simon and Schuster
Random house, Losses I hand em out
Bed time blow the candles out
You're a fraudulent purchase-- cancelled out
I haven't scrapped in years so we can dance it out,(h)

River city Rhymin
Wit precise timing
You don't want a problem
Cuz we all ridin
You might hear the sirens
All we see is violence
So Get inside
It's river city rhymin

Beat em up
Make it

We Warriors-- Like the kids in the 70s
Tell em i spit it heavenly
Never getting ahead of me
Ready for me ya better be
Energy--Cuz my crew is extra thick
Living our dreams like we in that inception flick
Test the click you in deep excrement
Cuz If you don't know what I represent
(you gone learn today)
I wish people needed permission to rap
cuz I'd be chuckii booker you'd be turned away
Peace to nekkron beats is Teflon
Hollow point rhymes better keep your vest on
Put a hand up, and move to the front
Say ho, whatever, do what ya want
(p) This is the moment where it gets real
Spit Ill from river city to sticksville
Ain't no best just pay yo debts
Or take fatal steps in this game of death, called

River city Rhymin
Wit precise timing
You don't want a problem
Cuz we all ridin
You might hear the sirens
All we see is violence
So Get inside and
Commence to hidin</pre>
