[Intro]
Most people are divided up
You know, just had to do this for the...
For the people and the love
You know, if you don't know who I am by now
My name is Lil B, shout, shout to the world...
Check me out!

[Verse 1]
Most people are divided up
Like it's Apartheid
I'm sleeping where the sharks lie
Never see the snake eyes
Unless you fuckin' with him
Always keep your distance
They won't have your back
But listen to every sentence
Never speak a sentence
You in the BasedGod's vision
And if you walk with it
Then it's a good decision
Don't try to talk a lot
Most people won't listen
You can't talk to yourself
To see the whole damn vision
Let's get it, Lil B!

One love, man
It's just game
I'm spittin' game
Throw it back to the lanes

[Verse 2]
I'm stepping in the dragon's lair
With smoke in my eyes
I'm not surprised
Hell on Earth, you can't stop them guys
With death on their minds
You can't stop their rides
With drugs in the car, with the eagle's eyes
Looking out for the cops and the needles, right?
Back then, they was watching and fiening
Like in the hood, dope man serving Jesus... life
No loyalty, no respect, no honesty
Honestly I'll move away
But niggas going to say that you never lived there
New Kids On The Block putting new bids there
New jails with new beds there
They waiting to put some new kids there
My niggas thought they'd never get theirs
Passed jail, fuck it, never lived there
Man I'm the rawest, it's Lil B

I'm spitting game
Let's get it, one live to live

[Verse 3]
Please tell me who's your boss
Cause I'ma tell them that their dude is lost.
And you gonna feel like triple the cost.
Of course I must be dumb, how I get this far?
I must be real wack, how I get this car?
Niggas wanna be famous, why reachin' so far?
Can't see through, it's like a soul
Metaphoric to the Earth, I turn anything to gold
You waited too long, dudes, your dreams is old
Better live now and go feed your soul
Better late than never, go collect my cheddar
Give my mom a big check, she gonna be straight forever
You ain't feeling me dog
My bank account was zero, you ain't feeling me dog
But I gotta be a role model
If he wrote all above
Lil B, brand-da-dang, swag!

Let's get it
One life to live</pre>
