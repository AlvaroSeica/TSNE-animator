They tell me focus on my future
But all I see is present and past
Had to talk to my momma thru a peice of glass
Seen grown men die for a peice of ass
The most respected men were the first to blast
Locked down going against the grain of the game wrong
No longer a child it pays to think now
Terrorists run wild in the streets of the Tennessee
Hustle hard get up on your feet and get blew away
Your either a predator (err) or its prey
Probably don't feel me if you aint living this way
Display patience today can be the day fuck fear
I'm a die either way people say give it up but
I've been in it for years I'm the topic of trash talk
To fuck with spilled beer I'm still here
Unlike most of my peers
Contributed blood sweet and tears to my career going...

Up, Down, Round &amp; Round
City from city, and town to town
We got some money in the past but the time is now.
We been be Up, We been down
We been round &amp; round

We didn't didn't come to play, joke, fuck around
We came to work motherfuckers better buckle down
I get mine sixteen bars at a time
You wont find many rhymes that are harder than mine
What I got to do break necks just to get checks
Sign with Suge Knight to get some respect
Drink cristal drive a brand new roles
Suck Carson Daily's dick just to be on his show
Fuck no, I aint with no kissing no ass
Even if it means being broke and getting no cash
I rather lay bricks then politic with you fake tricks
I feel like Keanu Reaves caught up in the hatred
I had my game sulted concentration broken
Explaining pill popping and the marijuana smoking
Warning you don't want to play with me
I'm not a die like the N-Y-F-D going...

Up, Down, Round &amp; Round
City from city, and town to town
We got some money in the past but the time is now.
We been be Up, We been down
We been round &amp; round

Life aint no joke stop smiling gun shoots and sirens
It pays to be trifling in this environment
Violence jumps in a instant
One must train to condition if intending to go the distance
Persistence pays to pray I put it down
Once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
Millions of motherfuckers live just like me
Lord have mercy have everyone down in the dirty
Commit murder for money It's hell being hungry
Stress like this turn doctors into junkies
The ground here is bloody no man can judge me
Ya I remember when I was young used to run with the crooks
Kept my ass in trouble should of had my nose in books
But I was seldom seen in the class room
Id be tryna get green shoot dice in the bath room

Up, Down, Round &amp; Round
City from city, and town to town
We got some money in the past but the time is now.
We been be Up, We been down
We been round &amp; round</pre>
