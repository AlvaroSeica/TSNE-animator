[Intro] [Rise talking]
Yo. Let me...let me. Avid. Sam yo...let me...
I'ma tell 'em. I'm...just tryin' to explain...yo

[Verse One]
Just to warn you before I go on (I go on)
I might disgust you more than you want (than you want)
I might buck you or cut off your arm (damn, my arm?)
Like, "Nigga fuck you." (Why?) Just for my song (oh)
Just to warn you before I go on (I go on)
I might disgust you more than you want (than you want)
I might buck you or cut off your arm (I don't fuckin' care) 
Like, "Nigga fuck you." (Why?) Just for my song (oh)
Don't change Alert Colors if I say I'm the bomb
Don't think that he's gully cause he say it in songs
But I'm mindin' my business, you mindin' yours
And the people in the wars don't have time to record
But whatever
Fuck everybody
Just in my song
That was written on the day I was drunk and then bored
When I vibe to aspire, I'm the best does that vex you?
Or do you sing along cause you know you're the best too?
Like our mind's canvas, invisible paint
You can't see this
Beat this with a missile or tank
I bring rap back a little just to rev it to speed
In rap I can say that I'll never leave
But in fact life ain't never to me
As I think back ever so cleverily
All these dudes rap now on whatever they see
In their life or their news at 11:00 T.V.

[Rise speaking]
But. Hold on. Yo...Should we fuckin...put the chorus. 
Or should we finish-yo, I'ma just gonna try to like...try to say a whole bunch of these shits. 
Where was I? 

[Verse Two]
Yo, all the movies, the rubies is makin' you vibe
Like my uzis are loosely attached to my thigh
Slippin' roofies, tell boobie's we're castin' inside
The first thing I see is breast then the last thing is eyes
King Kong ain't got nothin' on my actual size
My ex was just hatin' when she said that she lied
You're a joke, but just a priest, rabbi in a bar
You're a knock knock but nobody answer the door
If I am the movin' bomb, nobody move your arm
Nobody wave your fist
Nobody else shift
See I'm nice off of Pils Pock and Rum Spice
Women and mics, but my worse vice was advice
Left it alone
That shit'll end you
Dead in your zone, don't let the madness befriend you
Do as I say
Not as I do cause I'm cool
With the madness like we had went to the same school
So what I don't leave the house? I'm too fat/phat to get through doors
Call the firemen with swords so my mind can get to yours
My rhyme can make you all like a baby with a ball
And my vibe can make you sore call it crazy with the gall
I'ma praise me if you don't
I'ma praise you if you do
I'm a table you'se a spoon away from feeding Done With You
Yo
Rap is all talk
Smack's what y'all snort
Sometimes I ponder why blacks are all lost
And that includes you
Your maps a fake one
But not me
I'm not black I'm Haitian
Divide and conquer
They play us for fools
And to think your worse enemy coulda been you
This is my thoughtful reactions, converted to files
So this save on this answering system you dialed
My thoughts are Reverend Wright
Disassociate from me
Won't know the price, own the night nigga
Go create money
Man that's fifty bars any more and I'll charge
Yeah, rap can kiss me hard when they knew it they charged
The sun never hits
Don't let the door hit where you split
I'll get through the shit but I'll never get through the chicks
I'll play you some shit, but then I'll never get you to sit
I don't rap no more
It's been a whole day since I quit
And the underground don't wanna spend their paper for shit
And the overground is full of all these fakers with chips
Nigga, I could teach greatness and how to be nice
Even though my memory sucks, I forget how to ride bikes
How do I like
Camada?
Nowhere with nothin'
Just come in interruptin' all your pointless discussion
Who am I? The MC
You should spin it on vinyl
Was in a school to DJ but I skipped on the final
Became an MC
Don't call me a rhymer
I fucked up in New York, but it's on me in China
Call me a reminder of a time that you thought was behind ya
When better talent tormented you
Made you be kinder
Y'all should all turn this shit off and go read a book
We wear blinders to a world too gory to look
So I'm teachin' my kid all the speeches of B.I.G.
And show 'em Menace II Society to teach 'em who lives
Then I'm all about the chillin', sit back and I lounge
Since I rap in Greenwich Village, I just radio sounds
Am I here to complain or to rearrange the rise
What's in a name?
Screw you
You noticed after her eyes
But
Trinity loves me
The Oracle knows
But I rap about nothing and wear horrible clothes
And I don't even call, none of my old peeps
Me and my sister don't speak
We got Myspace beef
And it's weird how the world turns out to be
Yeah it's funny, but not ha ha he he
But my T.V.'s more important than all of my CDs
That I been recordin' since Apollo show with Keke
Had a crush on Mimi ever since I was a teeny weeny
Dealt with her I'm finny
Like I'm finished, she's so dreamy

[Rise talking]
Yo, you know what? I'm out. That's enough. I said fifty. I'm finished. How fuckin'...long was that?
Don't tell me, no fuckin' third verse. Alright I'm out. Be easy. Rise. Sam. Avid. Peace

[Verse Three]
I'm the most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
And rated wrong and catered when they're torn
Control freak
No sleep, speakin' in pen
My point, people pretend
Make sphincter of men
And I'll
Stop right here
But I gotta elaborate
Cause I'm not clear
And y'all like to exaggerate
Fork in the road
One side serene
But I always pick the side with the wolves and screams
Just cause it ain't typical
Just to make it difficult
I fed my ego
Until it was sick and full
The cure for the common cold came through my medley
And I'm somewhere that exists but nobody get's me
Can't sell to the clubs till you sell enough reefer
The record release of
Free to yell fire in theaters
When I'm hired to beat ya, you'll be my diarrhea
And I'm...

[Rise talking]
Yo. Alright. That's it. Peace. {echo}</pre>
