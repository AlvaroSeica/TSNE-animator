Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ah ha ha
Webby
Time to go get 'em
Ha

I don't care what none of you say
I'm a do shit my way
Been here for a minute and I'm here to stay
'Cause I'm just gonna do my thang

Made myself a name all by myself
Fuck a record label
I don't need no help
Actually I do because I'm broke as hell
But I'm just gonna do my thang

I'm a suburban white rapper
But I make it work
And now I'm comin' out the blue
Like a baby smurf

And yes I plays the perp
Put that L in rotation
And I'll be doin' that
Till I catch probation

Stop yo hatin'
I'm just here laughing
Spittin' intense
But I'm not going
Camping

Soon to be the champion
Steadily advancin'
Run the fucking beat till I'm crampin'
Dancin' around everybody
'Cause you know that
Webby got 'em rollin' deeper than Bikini Bottom
Pick 'em up and drop 'em

I'm a comacozie driver
Blowin' up in terms of rhyming
And I'm so hard
That nobody could revive 'em

Rappin' louder than a siren
When I show up in the ambulance
They gone scrape you off the floor
Man you'd never stand a chance

Climb that hill
Like an ant
Top speed accelerate
But the top
Ain't enough for me
I'll always elevate

Smokin' that celery
I'm the best flowin'
Leave your chick knocked up
Call me Seth Rogen

Back
Round two
I didn't kill 'em with the white noise
MJ's dead
Now we need another white boy

I don't care what none of you say
I'm a do shit my way
Been here for a minute and I'm here to stay
'Cause I'm just gonna do my thang

Made myself a name all by myself
Fuck a record label
I don't need no help
Actually I do because I'm broke as hell
But I'm just gonna do my thang

I run the game
Like the banker in Monopoly
Ain't no one on top of me
Except the chick sayin
"Put your cock in me"

I'm cocky
And I'm probably the illest
No modesty
If Em ain't the nicest white boy
Then I gotta be

And I don't need a gun
Never let the cannon shoot
Jumpin' over mother fuckers
Call me Crash Bandicoot

And it's true
I'll knock you outta your socks
And your boots
Eat you like an animal
I'll put 'em in a sandwich dude

Damn it you
When I put it on
Wax man
A dirty mother fucker
I just hopped out the trash can

And pussy?
I'm gettin' that fam
My dick's been in more holes
Than my brain's gone in a cat scan

And battle me son?
You don't really want it
Comin' back with my shield
Or I'm coming back on it

A Spartan to the heart
I will knock you unconscious
Flyer than a pilot
But no relation to Pontius

A toxic avenger
In to the Twilight Zone
Bro
And I'm coming back never
Music's runnin' through my veins
Webby is a beast
And I do my thang

I don't care what none of you say
I'm a do shit my way
Been here for a minute and I'm here to stay
'Cause I'm just gonna do my thang

Made myself a name all by myself
Fuck a record label
I don't need no help
Actually I do because I'm broke as hell
But I'm just gonna do my thang

I am who I am
And nobody can change it
And I'll get through our meet
Till I get myself famous

A pocket full of change
For the day;
I am anxious
And make myself money
Off a mastery of language

The portrait's been painted
So bitch
Better back off
Pick up the mic
And kill it because I'm that raw

And the next person to compare me to Ash Roth
Is getting every feature on their fucking face
Smacked off

I don't care what none of you say
I'm a do shit my way
Been here for a minute and I'm here to stay
'Cause I'm just gonna do my thang

Made myself a name all by myself
Fuck a record label
I don't need no help
Actually I do because I'm broke as hell
But I'm just gonna do my thang

I don't care what none of you say
I'm a do shit my way
Been here for a minute and I'm here to stay
'Cause I'm just gonna do my thang

Made myself a name all by myself
Fuck a record label
I don't need no help
Actually I do because I'm broke as hell
But I'm just gonna do my thang</pre>
