Typed by: Cno Evil

[Timbo King]
Amongst murderers, niggas who love to kill
Robbers and thieves, niggas that love to steal
Yeah, you fuck around you can lose your legs
I got cats that'll do you in, the grime Emmy
My nine semi, yeah you don't want it, Bo King got this
I hold knots like this, big money bags
Chains and whips, the biggest like that shit
It's gangsta, nigga, stomp with me
The Bronx with me, Gun Hill Road, one mill' sold
Platinum plus, gats we bust
Drugs and hoes, niggas make the world go hard
The real criminals, niggas that have no jobs
Nigga, niggas that have jobs, nigga
Niggas that have no jobs

[Chorus 3X: Timbo King, girl]
You gets no pussy, you gets no pussy
Fuck you, leave me alone (and that's G, nigga)

[Timbo King]
At the Plaza, hired a friend
She's from Brazil and she likes men with Indian skin
Now how, the fuck a rap nigga growing a child
Was that easy like, burning an owl, or burning..
Yeah, goodbye to you dudes, we body you dudes
Robbing you, then we duffin' you out of your shoes
Who's on first, now who's on second, I'm on third
I'm not playing, my nina's got 'em all praying
God save me, them Brooklyn niggas, they all crazy
Bo five-kazzy, now who the fuck want it?
We gambling grams, me and my mans
We got the block on watch, put them D's in the vans
Now that's my word, that's my word, twenty a gram
Fuck that, thirty a bird, flip something
Respect the juuk, this here, supposed the happen
Now who the fuck wanna start rapping, then start rapping

[Chorus to fade w/ phone conversations]</pre>
