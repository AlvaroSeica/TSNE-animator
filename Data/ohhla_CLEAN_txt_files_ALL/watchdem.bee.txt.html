Man you gotta watch dem haters
Watch dem haters, watch dem haters

Verse 1: [Beelow]

I gots a million motherfuckers that is down on my team
But theres a few niggas that hate me,
Cause when I walk I bling bling
See that's the niggas I gots to try
That's the niggas I rock-a-bye
That's the niggas that gots to die, Show the killa in my eye
Why try to hate on something you can't control
And take a chance to catch a bullet,  from head to yo ass hole
Why it's always niggas that you know that's trying to do you in
I find myself busting at my own friends
Bitch made nigga with a smile on his face
"You my boy", "That's my nigga"
You know what I say, "You gotta watch dem haters"
It's them niggas in yo town
"You gotta watch dem haters"
When you tryin' to get own the mound
"You gotta watch dem haters"
It's not them niggas on the sideline
"You gotta watch dem haters"
Ya own boy a rob ya blind
Yungstar, Jackson, Junior or what
Just a pussy ass nigga trying to make a come up
Hopping from click to click or should i say dick to dick
You done spent to many days behind bars bitch
It ain't my fault you got drunk and got yo fucking ass wiped
Now you walking round town always grunting and shit
You got beef speak up, don't be mumbling shit
Hard as hell behind close doors, just a second ballin click
We can speed this shit up, or we can slow this shit down
Either way Zuriel bring it we gone tear this bitch down
I hate you niggas with a passion, you can see it in my eyes
All playa haters i gotta rock a bye bye bye

Chorus repeats 2x

And I'll march nigga step if you fools got funk
Nineteen with six figures ain't a dream no more

And there they go, there they go with there hating before
But they don't know, they don't know I'm 'bout  to shut this bitch down
