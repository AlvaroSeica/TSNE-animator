[Kangol Slim] 
So leave yo man at home, 
We need some time to be alone, 
I got no time for all the fakin', 
All that playin' around procrastination, 

[Ms. Tee] 
Leave ya girl at home boy, 
Because I got no time to play no games, 
I haven't had you in a long time, and 
When ya cross my mind, 
I always think bout your love 

[Kangol Slim] 
So if ya wanna creep, you can creep with me 

[Ms. Tee] 
And if you wanna be, you can be with me 

[Kangol Slim] 
And if you wanna creep, you can creep with me, 
Say you can creep with me, 
I'll have you home by three, and 
If you wanna creep, you can creep with me 

[Ms. Tee] 
And if ya wanna be, you can be with me 

[Kangol Slim] 
And if ya wanna creep, you can creep with me 
Say you can creep with me, 
I'll have ya home by three 

[Kangol Slim] 
She is a real Hot Girl, 
She's the hottest thang, that ever came in my world 
Best believe she's a vibrant thang, 
We used to mess around, they said we had flame, 
Back then, I didn't know what to do with her, 
That's when she left me lone, and checked up with her 
But the girl love still runs deep, 
But every now and then, me and the girl still creep 

[Kangol Slim] 
So leave yo man at home, 
We need some time to be alone, 
I got no time for all the fakin', 
All that playin' around procrastination,

I haven't had you in a long time, and

[Ms. Tee] 
And if you wanna be, you can be with me 

[Kangol Slim] 
And if you wanna creep, you can creep with me, 
Say you can creep with me, 
I'll have you home by three, and 
If you wanna creep, you can creep with me 

[Ms. Tee] 
And if ya wanna be, you can be with me 

[Kangol Slim] 
And if ya wanna creep, you can creep with me 
Say you can creep with me,

[Ms. Tee] 
Leave ya girl at home boy, 
Cause I got some time I want to spend with you, 
She made get down right now, 
But she don't know, you still remain my boo, 
Every now and then, we'll talk, and will do somethin', 
But get distracted from all that kissin' and huggin' 
Why don't you meet me in the club ,we can hang, 
Later on hit the Teli and just do the damn thang,
