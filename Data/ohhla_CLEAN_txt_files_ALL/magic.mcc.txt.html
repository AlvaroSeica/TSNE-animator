[mc chris as Kyle XY]
Hello and welcome to the under...
{SSSHHHHH!} Sorry, sorry, sorry
Hello and welcome to the Underground
This is Darth Kyle, my new name is Kyle XY
because that's the program I miss most
in this brand new zombie apocalypse
(May The Force be with you)
We've been living three months, um, basically on our wits
But we're running out of food, we've begun to hunt
but animals have become scarce
Uhh, it may be time to move to the Forbidden Lands
(May The Force be with you)
We're gonna go around in a circle
and just say our name and say how the zombie apocalypse
has affected us and what summer movie
we are looking forward to the most
(May The Force be with you)

[First Mimsy]
Hey um, I was uh, formerly IG-89
and then I was Sawyer's Gun Stash
and now I am The First Mimsy
And... (May The Force be with you)
{SSSHHHH} Okay, go ahead)
Okay, it's been rough
I've got to admit it's been pretty hard
Umm my mother, God rest her soul, was eaten by zombies
My brother was eaten by zombies
My father was eaten by zombies
they're still living at the house
and I have not been able to get
my Legend of the Overfiend DVDs out of my room
(May The Force be with you)
Now, I ordered that on Amazon and it cost me $175
I haven't been able to masturbate to it
and its been something I've been wanting to masturbate to
since I was 16 and I first saw it, I'm pissed
(May The Force be with you)

[mc chris] That's tough, that's tough
[R.Stevil] Wait, Legend of the Overfiend?
[1st Mims] Legend of the Overfiend
[R.Stevil] Just get La Blue Girl, La Blue Girl's better
[1st Mims] I don't care, I'd rather wath the thing that I ordered
(May The Force be with you)

[Mr. Shark]
I am uhh Jimmy, airquotes, The Zombie, Stewart
Uhh my new name is uhh Mr. Shark
(May The Force be with you, may the The Force be with me)
{SSSHHHH} (You seriously have to lower your voice)
(We're gonna die if they hear you)

[Mr. Shark]
I don't... stipulate, I'm stipulating
I want to call this the alleged zombie apocalypse
I still don't think that zombies exist
Uhh y'know it's impossible, it's against the laws
of all logic and science ("we see them everyday")
You see zombies like you see the two women looking at each other
whereas it's really just a picture of a vase, and no zombies
(I know what you're talking about)
And I'm looking forward to the new Indiana Jones movie
to verify my latest correct theory
that the crystal skull of Indiana Jones
and the Crystal Skull was in fact, the skull of Jar Jar Binks
The Gungan from the movie Battlestar Galactica
(May The Force be with you)
{"That was Phantom Menace"}

[Resident Stevil]
I'm formerly Jackie the Hut, and Roland of Cilliad
(May The Force be with you)
My new nickname is, Resident Stevil
(May The Force be with you)
I think this has been hard on all of us
The hardest thing was going back to my
home to try to get supplies
and finding my God damn lying, cheating wife
and her fuck buddy, and they were both zombies
But they were still fucking wailing on each other
they were just 69ing, in my bed
My 1,600 dollar (that's an expensive bed) sleep piecee
(Tempurpedic?) Tempurpedic, nice bed
Fucking whore, fucking zombie shit juice all over her
It was disgusting. I got to really tear them apart
with the lawn mower (May The Force be with you)
Alleged zombie, alleged zombie, yes)
And I'm really looking forward to The Mummy 3
Even though I thought the first two movies and The Scorpion King
were both the fuckin worst movies I've ever seen in my life
(May The Force be with you)

[Darth of the Dead]
My name is uhh
You guys might know me as Darth Chh Chha Dootico
or Darth Chh Chaa Gracie
Now I'm known as Darth of the Dead
(May The Force be with you) {SSSHHHH!}
The apocalypse has been very hard on me
I spent the first 3 weeks of the apocalypse by myself
trapped inside of a shopping mall
specifically the back room of a Spencer's Gifts
All I was able to subsist on was edible underwear
but I did find out, if you guys never heard of
zombies do not like fart spray, it wards them off
{Oh shit~!} I have to say that I'm very excited
about the Dark Knight movie
I'm hoping that if any good comes out of this zombie apocalypse
Hopefully Heath Ledger might rise from his grave
and reprise his role as The Joker in future Batman movies
(Too soon!) Too soon? (May The Force be with you)

[When in Romero]
My name was Greedo 1977 {SHHHHH!!!!} {You'll kill us}
And uhh, and then it was Basement Safe
And now it's When in Romero
(May The Force be with you)
(can you lower your voice)
(lower your voice they'll kill us!) I was very...

[mc chris] Hey I hear you guys up there! {SSSSHHHHH!}
[mc chris] Hey, hey you guys!
{Hey, hey it's mc chris? He looks like a zombie! A zombie!)
[mc chris]
Throw down a rope ladder, let me climb up there
I wanna eat your brains! {You got blood coming out of your eyes!}
{You want to eat our brains??} Yeah, please!
{Then no, why would we let you do that?'}
{That's ridiculous, furthermore I, I still}
{That's a really fucked thing to ask us to do}
[mc chris] Guys, just throw down the rope ladder
Let me come on up there, itsounds like you're having fun
{No way, it's ridiculous you even ask us to do it}
{Why would we even do that? It makes no sense}
[mc chris] Let me have some of your sodas, some of your beans
Oh and I wanna eat your head, I can't, I can't
(Oh, now there you go, now we're not gonna let you up)
[mc chris] I don't know, pretense, I'm no good with it
I just wanna get up there
{We were close to letting you up, we were close}
but we're not letting you up cause you're gonna eat our brains
(Look, what do you think Ironman is gonna be like?}
{You think it's gonna be good? Yeahhh baby}
[mc chris] Well, I'm pretty excited about it
because Samuel L. Jackson is gonna play Nick Fury
in both Incredible Hulk and the Ironman movie
which kind of opens up a, just a Pandora's box
of what could be in the Marvel universe
{Forget this, you know what this isn't even worth}
{having a conversation about, I got some Salvia}
{Let's smoke up some Salvia gang}
Guys c'mon lemme smoke some of that Salvia with ya!
{Whooa! You don't even know!} {*all excited and shouting*}
Ahh it sounds like so much fun
Guys c'mon, lemme up there, lemme up there
{That, that, that is the most 15 most intense seconds ever}
{Hey, how did you rise from the grave}
I don't know, magic?
{In a world where there is magic, I also have magic}
{And I banish you to Hell, demonspawn!}
Nooooooooooooooo
{Alright let's smoke some more Salvia everybody}
{Whoaaaaaaaa! Salvia, that was a great toke}</pre>
