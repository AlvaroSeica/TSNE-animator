[Chorus: King Gordy]
Oh mirror, mirror
Can you tell me what you see? (Kali!)
I'm scared to look at you
Cause you looking back at me (Kali!)
Oh why oh why
Must the mirror show me these things? (Kali!)
Like the ways of the world
And the darkness that it brings (KALI!)

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm scared of the lightning
Afraid of the thunder
Scared to go to bed
Cause I'm afraid what may be under it
Scared of my black scare
And of my people
We all should be running for the steeple
Picture me a paranoid bipolar schizo nigga
World on my shoulder
Curses words and as I'm getting older
I'm sorta kinda tryna find a way to get me higher
A way to escape from the place
Damned by the hellfire and brimstone
I'm stuck in evil people tyranny
They see that gotta be
So the demons is even here in me
God got ya back, though the monster touch ya
Stay praying up cause darkness wants ya
Gotta get away from losing up these news
Watch you off a vodka and juice
So you let loose when you're locked in a booth
Speak clearly
Don't nobody come near me
Cause I'm bad for my own health
Save me from my own self
In the mirror

[Chorus: King Gordy]
Oh mirror, mirror
Can you tell me what you see? (Kali!)
I'm scared to look at you
Cause you looking back at me (Kali!)
Oh why oh why
Must the mirror show me these things? (Kali!)
Like the ways of the world
And the darkness that it brings (KALI!)

[Verse 2: King Gordy]
Yay see spirits
And me I see visions
Of me being Christian (what?)
Who you calling a Christian?
Oh shit that's me isn't it?
I have fallen in temples
Bleeding from every ligament
Of course I have to lynch us
And now my poor mom is crying in cathedrals
"You are not the son of God, quit lying to these people"
Oh mother they are trying to deceive you
I don't give a Michael right for these people
And his eyes be her equel
I have trouble making changes to need you
This mirror opened up my mind
I am Jesus Christ but the sequel
What the hell is this?
My reflection got me feeling avalanche
Now I envision heaven with me starring as a terrorist
It's [?]
We gon' live a life of sin

[Chorus: King Gordy]
Oh mirror, mirror
Can you tell me what you see? (Kali!)
I'm scared to look at you
Cause you looking back at me (Kali!)
Oh why oh why
Must the mirror show me these things? (Kali!)
Like the ways of the world
And the darkness that it brings (KALI!)

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm seeing your reflection
Noticing something 'bout ya
Hoping it won't take exorcism
To get this shit up out ya
Sitting in the dark
And it's remarkable
How I set my art apart
From the dark but too, oh, hard

[Chorus: King Gordy]
Oh mirror, mirror
Can you tell me what you see? (Kali!)
I'm scared to look at you
Cause you looking back at me (Kali!)
Oh why oh why
Must the mirror show me these things? (Kali!)
Like the ways of the world
And the darkness that it brings (KALI!)</pre>
