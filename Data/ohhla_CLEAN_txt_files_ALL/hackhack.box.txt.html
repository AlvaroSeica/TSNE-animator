Yeah
You heard the Canibus thing?
Well this is the chorus
MCXP 2012 Chords and Locusts

Chords and locusts
Seventeen wizened elvish magi berserk off the hay
Chords and locusts
Seventeen wizened elvish...fuck
Seventeen wizened elvish magi berserk off the hersch
Chronic weed addiction blame it then U say legalise it
Tax it
Iâm glad you think this is about you man I'm in legal shit
Mental torture this is off another patient
Still waiting impatiently impatiently waiting
Clean beheaded by shuriken and clean soiled self Pastrei
Bruce lee is back but I'm not gonna say what style he's brought back
Threat of violence bring it a known carrot fuck it its the uncharmed snake shit
I'm the stick
Violent reactionist
Violins or pianist VIP should be

Yeah, I know it's an unusual beat, man
Seventy percent of my fans disappeared in under one minute
Like when I run out of money on reverbnation.com
Like they got more love for herpes man
MCXP
I wanna spit a couple hundred bars man ill prolly pass out and shit , nah, cool
Turn the beat up a little bit, man
If I make telepathic contact with humans Gandalf comes around and I put names to faces like 256
The forbidden manuscript
I could tell you whatâs in it but I'm afraid it's forbidden
Oh the guilt
Nah
Man this is worse than the Book Of Rhymes Out-takes
But
Not tortured by me but tortured as 'you' ordered?
Funny enough Iâm thinking lightning and listening to Doom on Doom
Funnier than living hell then she makes contact saying stuff like âhi Rog
Hows it going with Lizzie?â
Cos everyone knows that one
Man one more time
If I concentrate on something else she misses me
We got one of your songs in common
But she might not know it
On some battling shit
For example, 'Bis
It's a way of avoiding legals
Shit is lethal
Chess with 'C' starts unintended usually
Anything but boards
But why do you cry to Charlotte and not me?
About MF MF CH
She took your life apart man-she-do
Man I'm crying internally eternally
And you're crying inside me
And I'm crying inside that
Outside straight raining
The typical expected reaction to listening to your beats
Is bursting into tears
Teared and torn apart by beatings
Being obsessed with the 'b' on the squire shit
Shit, right
Powers telekinetic temporarily taken by Bob Frisell
I'm no-one and the latest Nas got 3 self-sub-subliminal and it ain't hard to tell, or sell
Put it out on the radio like stubbing spliffs out on a shitty Hitachi
One Stop, the experience doesnât stop one from being
Still taken as Tauran supply teacher from Tau Ceti, like
(????????) tau satellite
Where's he from?
Well we'll give you anything
Things considered a little different
As the kids test stage one
The fact Iâm schizophrenic paranoid
Schizo berserk off the wizard, berserk off the hashish, off the beers
And off some certain other shit, Right On
Well I'm stil on the Tylenol Dragon Breath
And those with breath disease complain when I'm around
Breath is that deceased
The voices say I donât have voices
Surround sound like I have a really nice environment
The chevron
Captain only rank in fact confirmed middling rank
Liverpool or Saints, England emperor
facing' Bolton non-brigand Brigadier, and knaves
These are krazy krazy krazy krazy knights
Spray painted plate armour auras of chivalry
but it's so unwanted in the modern age
Sir Galahad is writing about female chivalry
he got dumped for holding a door open for the bitch
Yeah, whatever man
That, I'm afraid, Sir, is mutiny
Well mutiny it is
On an Aero or a Wispa let alone a Bounty
Man
I'm never gonna be able to freestyle a couple hundred bars
So I'm just gonna read some stuff off the laptop
Peace to you and your Brethren</pre>
