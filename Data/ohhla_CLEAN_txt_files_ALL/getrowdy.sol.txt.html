[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yo, it's that money anthem
If you spending as much money as I'm spending
Get rowdy, yeah, here we go, you already know

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
My dudes, put your hands up, up, up, up, up
Young ladies, let me say your dump truck drop, cuz S. Childs in the spot
And I'm about to get rowdy, get rowdy, rowdy
If you spending money like I spend
And duke talk too much his back gotta bend, get 'em

[Solomon Childs]
Baby girl you can run with a rider
Slide your thong all the way to the side, cuz
Get better bounces, from your Good Year tires
Capri's grippin' like a pair of plyers
Why you steelo hunting, try'nna read between the lines of these liars
I'm on the side book 'em, Mazoratti status
Out on bail with two priors, fuck this though
Flossin' no, with them Gucci gazelle's
And dudes ain't seen Staten Island put it down this well
Since the Nicholas Balls cartel, I'm 25, spending breadito
Like I worked for 40 years, license plate reads "nothing to fear"
Got money to make in here, so far up top
Imagine the money I'mma spend this year

[Chorus w/ ad-libs]

[Solomon Childs]
Diamoned up, safari back, empire's back
Theodore Unit on the arm
Gun on my arm, beautiful doves with access
To them bank accounts, in the middle of the day
And pounce they cake, on the rhythm before we bounce
More shopping sprees, for Jimmy Tools, over toe shoes
Can't stop, the bailey's, bank the bittle
For iced out diamonds and bracelets and ankle anklets
Sippin' pina, strawberry colada sprints
Lookin' like Angela Jolie, and Brad Pitt, when we walk in the backwoods
Bottom line, homey, son deal
Niggas don't wanna murder nothing bredren, at all
Nigga don't have no money, bredren, uh-huh
On my way to the top, you wanna ball, you gon' spend all you got

[Chorus w/ ad-libs]

[Solomon Childs]
The sound of money? That's right
I got dudes that punish, like Tae Kwon Do
Body Brighton, Magilla Gorilla flow
Ching-ching, that's the sound of the rope cracking
I run this boat now, good evening ladies and gentlemen
I am your captain, and you young hustler
Perpetrating with money, stop acting

[Chorus w/ ad-libs]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
I'm about to go, but before I go
I want to see this place get on fire
And get... get... get... get....get... get...
Yo Promoter, you know I'm coming to see you</pre>
