[Buckshot]
I ain't no joke, plus I got the bright smoke
Try to, cut my throat and I'ma go for broke
First of all I'm lettin motherf...ers know the deal
that if you steal from Buck, you bound to kneel
Now you can call it a loop, and you can get the clearance
but, to me it's interference when I move so what?
If you interfere you get ended here and get ate up
Couldn't hold your weight up, as I
take hold of your spirit mind body and soul
Buckshot keeps the crowd controlled
So when I look in the crowd, and watch how people wonder, "Damn"
The way I flip my lyrics they don't understand
I'm just an addict addicted to microphones
Maybe it's a habit, uhh, I gotta grab it
Even if it's broken I'ma fix that *shit*
Put it together, get in your face and kick that *shit*
Cause you ain't never, heard another MC like B.D.B.
Emcee, rockin double-D and we
get busy, I'ma strip that throat
Peep it loc, breath control, I ain't no joke

[Funkmaster Flex]
Yaknahmean?  Big shot to my man Buckshot
Big shot to Dru Ha, the whole Boot Camp Clik
Big shot to Duck Down, knahmean?!!
Funkmaster Flex,  volume two, sixty minutes y'all... fla-vor

I got a question - who remember the Panthers?
Who can get the average man to
think with a military mind prepare get ready
you bomb first, no time to rehease the verse
Obey your thirst, but this ain't Sprite
Just take a sip of the liquid lyrics, I give all night
Blinded by the daylight sight
Follow my lead, cause I'ma lead you right
You heard, I was waitin on the sidelines
Waitin for the guidelines to attack so I can pay you back
Word, you ain't never heard a better superb
MC better than Buck, huh, break a leg good luck
if you think you gettin past the blast ask the question
How you think Buck last, in the game?
So long, cause I was strong from the beginnin of time
When I wrote my first rhyme I was like damn
B.D. let the pen smoke
Cause I knew bitin it could make you choke
Buck ain't no joke
