[ScHoolboy Q]
Straight to the block, to the hood, to a spot
Cocaine to a rock, deuce-deuce in a sock
Every dollar closer to a drop, every drop is closer to a cop
Every cop is closer to a cell, hit the cell, your ticket right to hell
No job, no bail, no fam, no mail
New statistic, another nigga fail, go from pussy to a prison tale
Fuck that, I quit while I'm ahead, ship my music off like I'm Astaire
Turn it up and hear the ghetto pledge, live righteous nigga like my brother said
King Tut, Martin Luther, Malcolm X, but I'm his shooter
Top rhyming/ramen, knowledge for the noodle, finally getting praised, yeah kudos
Doing bad, still loving E, connect, said it's something up his sleeve
Said, I'd rather bust off them ki's, yeah nigga, birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez

Want to do a song, but it's hard to carry on
And my daughter hungry sitting home, and my girl, she said she feel alone
I can tell it's over in her tone, only time I call is for a loan
She be stressing, so depressing, always worried every time a lil' nigga gone
Stay strong for the future, stick together, yeah suture
Get a couple whips, yeah Kunta, ScHoolboy but gangsta was his tutors
Say that money be the root of evil, look around see what it do to people
Veins leap from heroin use or PCP, inject their body with a needle
Lord help us, swear to God, dope dealers get a job
Keep it real, this shit ain't really cool, being in a cell you ain't alive
Niggas quick to show out over cheese, love to help the Devil do a deed
So I'd rather bust off the ki's, yeah nigga, birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez

Tired of the same old shit, niggas, they faking it
Niggas out here living foul, better yet they flagrant
Teach these niggas right about the game, get these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy and leave this dope alone and count my change

[Kendrick Lamar]
Q, I want to see you do your thang, entertainment business, living limelight
Hop on every track and move them trains, show these motherfuckers that you've been tight
than they ever been, it's evident that you intelligent but you can't escape that life
And for you my nigga I would sacrifice myself to make it just to see you hold the mic
and hit the stage and rock the set, but it's hard to change when you from the set
Won't you think about it nigga, life or death? Like a cracker like to hang ya by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys and jet, or you wanna see them runway jets?
Fly to Singapore, one-way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to God it's hard out here for a young black man to live
If you don't do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
My nigga won't you tell Michelle I love your daughter, please don't let her grow up, life without her father
Look at what you bought her money couldn't buy, all she need is love, put the shit aside
At the same time know they gotta eat, know you got to hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HTC
No A.C. and the block hot, you keep running, cops say freeze
Blue pill, red pill, choose now, birds or the beez?
Birds or the beez?
Birds or the beez?

Count my change
Count my change</pre>
