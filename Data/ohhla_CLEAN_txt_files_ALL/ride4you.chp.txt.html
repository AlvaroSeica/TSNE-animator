Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, you know what
You, yeah, you. You know it. You, you know it, girl!
Yeah, don't be silly, you, you know it

I'm here, I'm here as your friend baby, I'm here for you
Here, I'm here as your friend baby. I'm here for you

Tell me now we gon' ride for you, yeah yeah
Tell me now we gon' ride for you, you know

Look, I'll burn a dollar bill, I'll put my whip for sale
Girl if we was Eskimos for you I'd kill a killer whale
I'd try to ace a test but cheat and get a C at best
I'd sling a bag of crack to Singapore and get beat to death ha
Anything to please you, feel success
I'd go beyond the bed and bath just to relieve your stress
The realest sex, no next, delete the rest
I'll call up DJ Khaled few voicemails so you feel the best
Look I love you but you love a lime, leaving sour face skittle trails all over my mind
My imagination never leaves me far behind
So when you wake up from your shake up see who's down to ride 4 you

Tell me now we gon' ride for you, yeah yeah
Tell me now we gon' ride for you, you know
Tell me now we gon' ride for you, yeah yeah
Tell me now we gon' ride for you, you know

Yeah, ooh girl, don't be silly don't be stubborn, don't be spoiled rotten,
I know what you want, you've got it coming
If you can't cooperate with the laws and the vision we could be really good friends
I know I can give you what you're missing
If you listen, the littlest things are so colossal
If you could treat my world like it's gold then boo I got you
You could be my homegirl lover, ain't no other
You ain't bout to wonder, I am here, I am down for you
If you act right, you know I got you
You my girl you got to understand my world, keep it so real, keep it girl
You and I, and anything we do, we do it fly
You my A'est boo, if you by my side then I'm gon' ride for you

Tell me now we gon' ride for you, yeah yeah
Tell me now we gon' ride for you, you know
Tell me now we gon' ride for you, yeah yeah
Tell me now we gon' ride for you, you know

It's just a simple thing, a simple thing
Baby if you hold me down, baby if you hold me down
I will give you everything, everything
You could be my roll dog, I could be your homie

It's just a simple thing, a simple thing
Baby if you hold me down, baby if you hold me down
I will give you everything, everything
You could be my roll dog, I could be your homie

My baby don't trip cause she on the grown tip
I keep her on the hush hush treat her like my home chick
You know she down to ride live her life on the edge
A million miles a minute living life no regrets

Yo her friends they be texting sometimes, but I don't
Ever give them replies cause they won't
Ever have what we have
Our conversations are crack, the little face with your laugh
You've got me fiending for that that that

Tell me now we gon' ride for you, yeah yeah
Tell me now we gon' ride for you, you know
Tell me now we gon' ride for you, yeah yeah
Tell me now we gon' ride for you, you know</pre>
