[Poppa]
I'm like b-town bottom gang, that's what my thugs bang
Ask me what I bang bitch I'm a say blood gang
No I'm not retarted, but my screws loose
And I will leave a hole to see through you
When they have a party they say don't let Poppa in
Cause they knowin that I'm tryna sneak that choppa in
And they knowin that they gon hafta bring that docta in
Ion play no games lil daddy I'm a real goon
Behind my set, I'll send you to tha uppa room
This ain't no nickelodeon this ain't no cartoon
We some head huntas, daylight killers
Bottom bar gorillas, been like that since we was little
I'm a rep my set, untill the day I leave
I feel like pac, I'm the last muhfucka breath
Ohh, nah nah, nah, nahh
What you tell em, play with that bottom then it's bun bun bun byeee

[Chorus]
You know retarteeeeeed
I'll shut down ya partyyy
You know dumb
Is you stupid? if yeen reppin yo hood
Where yhu from?
Is yhu stupid, is you dumb
Cause I'm, Cause I'm... retarteeeeeeed
I'll shut down ya partyyy
You know dumb
Is you stupid? if yeen reppin yo hood
Where yhu from?
Is yhu stupid, is you dumb?
Cause I'm

[Big B]
I'm retarted like a muhfucka, you ont know my name
Big B on the track that Clipper Road is what I bang
From that 318 to 255 it ain't a thang
Fa dem jack boys to run up on you with that thang
Nigga betta know ya road and stay up in ya lane
Cause you gon see some flames when you hear our choppa rang
X box in the pawn shop, ion play no games
With them scary chicken niggas like they live in rajor cane
Cause I'm loaded like a rifle, rollin like a biker
Out my mind tryna keep my focus like a sniper
Stomp you from the floor to the basement if we ont like ya
Betta get ya baby mama Cause nigga I will 1st night ha
Betta not let a pussy nigga pass my way
I'm feelin like I can whoop a pussy ass all day
Bank roll I be countin cash all day
I'm retarted like I took the same class all day

[Chorus]
You know retarteeeeeed
I'll shut down ya partyyy
You know dumb
Is you stupid? if yeen reppin yo hood
Where yhu from?
Is yhu stupid, is you dumb
Cause I'm, Cause I'm... retarteeeeeeed
I'll shut down ya partyyy
You know dumb
Is you stupid? if yeen reppin yo hood
Where yhu from?
Is yhu stupid, is you dumb?
Cause I'm</pre>
