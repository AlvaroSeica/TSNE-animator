[ VERSE 1: Reef the Lost Cauze ]
I wish I could make it better but I can't, baby
Wish I could ease the pain but I'm just a man, baby
I know you're feelin so alone but understand, baby
I'm here until the oceans wash away the sands, baby
Life is damn crazy, we don't know what challenges
Will arise, can't put it on your calendar
You can't plan it, I can't stand it
I just wanna take you away from this planet
Cause it just doesn't deserve you
It just seems to abuse, suffer and hurt you
That's why I could never desert you
I wanna be the one who preserves you
Cause I know what you're worth, you
Are the strongest person I know
Please don't ever let go till the end of the road
But you ain't nowhere near that
You sayin you can't make it, I don't wanna hear that
Look in my eyes

[ CHORUS ]
(I can see the sun)
It's gon' shine again
It's gon' rise again
It'll be fine again

[ VERSE 2: Reef the Lost Cauze ]
I don't know what to say to you
So I guess I'll just get down on my knees and pray with you
I'm sorry for your loss, I'm sorry for your pain
I'm sorry that it had to go down this way
I know you're feelin kinda lost right now
And I know you might not want to talk right now
But if you need anything, please give me a ring
It's crazy, it feels like I'm seein things
Cause I was just sayin the same thing last week
To somebody else, this just can't be
Life, we droppin like flies
Look into my eyes, it's just not right
When will it stop? When will it end?
When will we realize that we just killin our kin?
I dedicate this to all those who lost a loved one
Just hold your head cause soon the sun comes

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Reef the Lost Cauze ]
Sometimes I be ready to flip
This rap life is crazy, I be ready to quit
I put my life into this, my time, my money, my grind
I've lost my mind, my honey, my money, my time
It's funny how time just passes
I'm 25, 'bout to surpass it but still ain't surpassed this
Hurdle, vicious cycle, vicious circle
So I'm the studio spittin verbals, hittin purple
Another show, hustlin kids at the merch booth
It's how I survive, this is just work, duke
No rest for the wicked, many nights I've worked through
14 years since I wrote my first tune
Travelling man laid up in the back of a van
Suitcase full of CDs strapped to his hands
Watchin out the window waitin for the sun to shine
I'm waitin for the sun to rise, it's gonna come one of these times
