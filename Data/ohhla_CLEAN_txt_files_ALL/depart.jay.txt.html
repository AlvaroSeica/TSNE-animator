Typed by: AZ Lyrics

As the tears welled up in my eyes
My mama said "son what happened?"
Sometimes I can't breathe cause it's so much crap man
I called on god but he don't call back and
Fight to stay sane while the devils laughin
Last night I was across the tracks
With freddy and black teddy just playin a crap game
Smokin on stank
Sippin on drank
When brian came flyin up the block like batman

{*panting*} minnie got killed!
His wig got peeled in the callio
By some tenth ward niggas that we barley know!

I said hold up, whoa whoa whoa whoa
You must be joking but he wasn't laughin
Freddy passed out in the the grass and that's when
His mother came outside and said "where's minnie?"
I looked down at the ground "I don't know where he's at maam"
Lump in my throat I just lost my best friend
Conneticuit minnie with the easy coast accent
Top it all of, my older cousin mookie got caught
With some yellow capped barrels of crack man
It's time for me to leave home ma that's that man
It ain't much left here to see for a black man
I'm a spread my wings pursue this rap thing
Kiss my baby sister tell her I'll be back
I'm on I-10 east bound to manhattan
Nyc yes sir that's rap land
A one way ticket, a trunk of clothes
I spent my last 25 cent on pac man
Mister bus drive set me free
Just take me to new york and let me be</pre>
