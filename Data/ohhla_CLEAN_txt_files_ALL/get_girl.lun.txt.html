[Lunch]
(Verse 1)
Fa 'sho, sure
Y'all best believe
No shirt on, I got a trick up my sleeve
I'm a true G
I'm a new breed
Hey yo, shorty
You heard about me?
Gold complex
Make 'em thighs flex
I'm a straight up cat, you wanna have sex?
You wanna make moves?
You wanna sip booze?
You wanna see my crib?
You wanna chill and groove?
I'm so proper
Ladies-heart stopper
Tell me what you need, indeed, I got ya
Like finer thangs?
Like buyin' thangs?
Call me Arizona, I don't make it rain
But I make a change
Got a attitude
But I do, too, so I can't be mad at you

Pre-Chorus: Lunch
You strikin' with the venom
You fittin' in that denim
You bouncin' to the rhythm, go ahead, girl and get 'em
Get 'em
Get 'em

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
The South get Dirty
Midwest swangin'
East Coast bananas
The west coast bangin'
Get 'em like it's stankin'
Money, I be bankin'
It is what it is, baby, tell me what you thinkin'
Get 'em out in Texas
Talk so country
Want a Cali nigga, what is it, girl, it's Lunch
She got the munchies
And I do, too
She wants to hump me
And I'll let you
When to stand up
I like y'all too
Never been to Chi-Town, heard y'all cool
Have no fear
I have arrived
We can do this all day and damn night
If that's right
Then we can be friends
Wanna come back, we can do it all again

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Fingazz
Like the way you shake it, what you got like that
Head from ya lookin' way better from the back
Girl, go and get, get
Get, get, get it
And you know all them boys with, with, with it

(Verse 3)
Now I'm just trouble
I just mumble
Keep on boppin'
I just bubble
It's gettin' to a huddle
You think about that
Yeah, I can ball, I be's the quarterback
Now, make it snap
Don't rip your jeans
The king of all kings
You know what I mean

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus
