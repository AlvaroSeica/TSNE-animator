[Syd Tha Kyd]
What happened to make you, to make you start to hate me?
I once was your heart; worth love, and you were my everything
Sometimes I wonder whyyyy, I still try
Don't say it's over

Cause we both know no one's perfect
Baby I feel like this could be worth it, ohhh
Cause I haven't felt much myself lately
What I got to do, to get back my lady?
Ooooh... oh ohhh ohh, oh ohhh </pre>
