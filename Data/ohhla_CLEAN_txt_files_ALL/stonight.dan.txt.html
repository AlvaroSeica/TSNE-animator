Song:   Sick Tonight
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I feel sick tonight
Something in my stomach ain't sitting right
But I've got to overcome it, keep spitting tight
I've gotta overcome it, keep spitting tight, keep spitting tight

I feel sick tonight
Ring the bell, throw in the towel; I ain't fit to fight
I'm in hell; I don't know how I can hit this height
But I gotta overcome it, keep spitting tight, keep spitting tight

Trick the switch and get my brain to begin again
Adrenalin and Benalin will get the cerebellum in
A state to deliver lines timed to be the medicine
Lose my breath, they're Ventolin, lose an arm, then rent a limb

Choose to not present them in lies but still remembering
I am not am not a veteran; I do not know everything
Hide behind this pseudonym, I do not presume to win
Write lines till I feel true to them, decided by the mood I'm in

So I serve up words naked, never in sugar coats
And I write more quotes than a fucking big book of quotes

That's that, straight fact
When it's down on the track you can't take it back
And if the crowd don't react or get on ya back
Then you've failed and you just have to live with that

I remember when I was a kid 'n' that
Way before I found beards and caps
Pencils came with erasers that
Could erase your mistakes erase, retract

But in the real world things just ain't that easy
You can't take back your mistakes so freely
You gotta take them in think about them deeply
Not ignore them and just move on discreetly

They say Jesus died for somebody's sins but God knows he didn't die for mine
Coz I'll stand accountable for my own damn sins each and every time

And if my sins are too great to be accepted in the circles which I strive
Then I'll go right ahead and live a lone lush life in some small dive

I feel sick tonight
I feel sick tonight
I feel sick tonight
I feel sick... tonight

My head hurts
From running head first
Into another said verse
(on a subject that ain't easy to talk about)

It gets worse
Feels like my legs burst
I swear I feel cursed
(get up; if you feel the strain you just walk it out)

Because we live a lie for a lie and then truth for truth
But lies can be sly and the truth aloof
And it seems that lies can disguise and dupe the youth
So we gotta try to define what suits as proof

Back on track now quick to react now
If the beats change then my flow will adapt how
Ever it has to do so break up words like letter cubes thrown
Around the room without a care
Stretch out letters when there's space to spare
How can you not love this language?
It's beauty and pain and relentless anguish
Each twist and turn that you're controlling
Taste each verb as off ya tongue it's rolling
Nothing is more entertaining
Than fuckin' with words and their arrangement
Every syllable can rhyme
If you will afford the time
But now I'll leave it there alright
And simply declare

I feel sick tonight

I feel sick tonight</pre>
