[No Malice]
Yes! Uh...
I go against the grain, see I'm in my own lane
They only seem first cause I'm in re-VERSE!
It's like I moonwalk on 'em
Ain't nothing like havin said yes to your calling
I get better with age while time's evolving
I'm a vintage wine, I'm a retro Jordan
So mature, Mr. Thornton
If I turned my back, you'd be left orphaned
I caution against sun belief
I guess that make me old school like a dungaree
But my britches don't sag, 'bout riches I don't brag
But somehow I can't help but to show my aaahhh--
Class is in session! Chain heavy like opression!
The new me got 'em guessin
So I tell 'em if they got any questions, raise your hand

[Chorus: Fam-Lay]
It's a G--damn shame
You stayed in the game, it's a G--damn shame
The things people to say to make some G--damn change
When you dropped your top you lost your G--damn brains
Hah, let me think about it
It's a G--damn shame
You stayed in the game, it's a G--damn shame
The things people to say to make some G--damn change
When you dropped your top you lost your G--damn brains
Hah, let me think about it

[No Malice]
Within every lyric, you can tell when you hear it
The KRS-One, "Black Cop" in my spirit
Twilight saga, the flow cannot be mirrored
Only by His grace, we escape judge and juror
One thing I'm sure of, Lord as my witness
Show me ten kingpins, I'll show you ten snitches
They said I lost my mind but I got ALL my senses
Nothing but the truth in ALL my sen-ten-ces
Always gave you truth, even in my offenses
The feds came knockin, turned ALL my niggaz Christians
We was in the kitchen, waterin the pot
Playin Top Chef 'til Tony got chopped
Wake up call, it was like time stopped
But you gotta love Tony cause the dime never DROPPED
Yes~! The check is in the mail
Commissary baby and your kids are eatin well

[Chorus]</pre>
