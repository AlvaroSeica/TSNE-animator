"This morning you've got time for a hot home cooked breakfast.
Delicious and piping hot in only three microwave minutes."

"Are you kidding?!"

[Dave] + (Gruff Rhys)
Yo, pretty packages of frosted delights
(Look, it comes with a toy, hehe, I like that
I wanna number four, number six, and throw in a plastic donut)
Just enjoy the gritty crunch that tastes just like chicken?
Wrappers of many bite sizes
(Man, are you freaking blind!? That's a rock)
All mixed into potful
Momma's home-made from scratch well not quite! (Nope!)
Toasted over flames they be tasting quite right!

[Posdnuos] + (Gruff Rhys)
All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers 
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
Don't waste time with ya net
Our net worth is set
Ready, go, many know others (What?)
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we be brick it
With the twenty-four hours sign
Shower mine happens
While you dine like grabbers
with the crunchy, crunchy carrots
(Oh, that's chicken!)
Gotta have it super? fast!

"? breakfast you got time for..."

[2-D]
Super fast, super fast
I come in last, but just, in time for breakfast
Keep it true, keep it true, forever blue 
The night, the night throws at us
aluminum, a crucial food, aluminum
The sea is radioactive, the sea is radioactive

[Posdnuos] + (Gruff Rhys)
All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers 
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
Don't waste time with ya net
Our net worth is set
Ready, go, many know others (What?)
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we be brick it
With the twenty-four hours sign
Shower mine happens
While you dine like grabbers
with the crunchy, crunchy carrots
(Oh, that's chicken!)
Gotta have it super? fast!

[2-D]
Super fast, super fast
I come in last, but just, in time for breakfast
Keep it true, keep it true, forever blue 
The night, the night throws at us
aluminum, a crucial food, aluminum
The sea is radioactive, the sea is radioactive

Super fast jellyfish (Repeat x4?) 
(Don't waste time!)
Super fast jellyfish (Repeat x20)</pre>
