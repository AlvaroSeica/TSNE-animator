First Verse:

I see some stankin' booty hoes y'all, in the mall
They all on my nuts, boy I'm tryin' to get 'em all
Where my "Bitch-Be-Gone" spray?
Fresh off the Blocc I'm tryin' to scoot and go that-a-way
Hello!  It's comedy, these hoes love fuckin' G
I take a fat swig of that gin and give that ass a breeze
Where all my mackin' ass nig-a-roes?
Who never gave a fuck about a trap or a hoe?
Fa sho my nigga!
We keep it crackin' like bats in the all-black jags
Two times for my nigga!
And it stay like that!
We twenty deep boy!  Bringin' on the calvary!
In the club, givin' them girls all they salary

Chorus:

All I ever wanted to do!
Is fuck hoes and keep fresh clothes
Hang with my folks and drink brew, I said
All I ever wanted to do!
Is keep a nine by my waist side
Stay paid, and live the good life

(2x)

Second Verse:

It's Coleone, nigga have no fears
All up in your bitch like a Doctor doin' a pap smear
I came to tell ya one thing young nigga!
Bangin' a bitch, won't make your manhood bigger
Rockin' this gold chain, fuck a diamond pinky ring!
Talkin' that shit in the club, but your punk ass still came
It's Coleone, bitch I thought you knew?
Like every other muthafucka in my crew
I'm pimpin' purses out hookers and still make my change
Niggas want to get blessed in a real bad way
Cut this fuckers grip, real L-I fe
Coleone, a mack savage on a H-O-E

Chorus

Third Verse:

You want me to wise up?  Coleone a player
Nikes and Levis, never sport gators
Make a hoe, my [???] that's me!
Shake 'em like my dick after I pee
Got it goin' on y'all, in the club with dubs
If you ballin' about your mail, throw your set on up
Nothin' but hoes on my dick, got 'em poppin' like porn
See a bitch up in the streets
*BEEP* *BEEP*  That's my horn
I'ma macaframa gurgitatin' game so tough
Keep a plug up on my steering wheel cuz hoes do fuck
I wanted to get it, now I got it, livin' life carefree
So when they scream Coleone, you know that's me

Chorus (2x)</pre>
