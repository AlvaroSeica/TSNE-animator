[Diddy]
She got me higher than a motherfucker
She got me flyin in this motherfucker
Ready to die up in this motherfucker
God damn she badder than a motherfucker, yeah, uh-HUH!
Let's make a movie - two superstars
Two big body Coupes, +Avatars+
The marriage niggaz stay in they Econo Lodge
I stay in Louis bedspreads, camouflage
Let's... go

[Usher]
She wants the finer things and all that she can get from me (c'mon)
She even wants the lovely cutie on my arm (yeah)
She get it in all way turned up she a rider
She says she's in the mood for love

[Chorus: Usher] + (Didddy)
Watch out that girl is trouble
They ain't got nothin on her
Can't even fight her hunger
She a get it girl, watch her do her thing
What she got she get from her mother
She super straight body shaped like no other
She's makin her way to my area
And when she gets past security, I say
(Hello! Welcome to my table)
(Bring your girlfriends, everythang paid fo')
(We gon' get it in, ain't that what you came fo'?)
(Heard you was looking for me!)
She say she looking for love
And all the girls in the club know whassup
She say she undercover though, and this is what she wants

[Diddy]
Straight off the Concorde, to cheers and encore
Nice sweats, she fiend for one boy
The innovator, young Sean Combs
Reminiscing me and Biggie bringing boys home
Father figure, hating's for them other niggaz
Dirty Money went and brought a money printer
Now my money longer than the Mississippi river
Money makin extraordinaire - I am the nigga

[Chorus]

[Diddy]
Yeah, I see you
Bring your ass on over here
And stop playin
Yo Usher, talk to her!

[Usher]
I - I know just what you like
I - I wanna make you feel good inside
Girl if you just give me a little bit
I know you gon' love it
I - I know you wanna try
I - I'm the only thing on her mind
Tonight, she's mine, all mine

[Outro: Usher] + (Diddy)
(Hello! Welcome to my table)
(Bring your girlfriends, everythang paid fo')
(We gon' get it in, ain't that what you came fo'?)
(Heard you was looking for me!)
She say she looking for love
And all the girls in the club know whassup
She say she undercover though, and this is what she wants
(Fuck with me)</pre>
