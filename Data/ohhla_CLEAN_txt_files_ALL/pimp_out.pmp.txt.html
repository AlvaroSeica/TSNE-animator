[Pimp Daddy]
One girl, that's talkin' shit
Two just come and ride my dick
Three girl's and you will see
Four and how good this dick can be
Now five, I'ma have to do you right
Six just ride my dick all night
I say ohh, girl I love you so
Sike I don't give a fuck about a dark ass hoe
Now bitch I got game on you dog ass hoes
You will never catch me slippin cuz my game is cold
I like to talk about you hoes in my rhyme
So do that lick bitch, and go the whole nine
Shove this dick to the back of yo throat
Cuz bitch I don't mind bustin' nuts in yo nose
If think about screamin' I'ma shove some more
deep down yo throat till ya lose yo voice
Cuz I ain't no fuckin' joke when I'm fuckin' you hoes
Never fall for a bitch cuz my game is cold
I say one girl, that's talkin' shit
Two just come and ride my dick
Three girl's and you will see
Four and how good this dick can be
Now five, I'ma have to do you right
Six just ride my dick all night
I say ohh, girl I love you so
Sike I don't give a fuck about a dark ass hoe
Now bitch I got game on you dog ass hoes
You will never catch me slippin' cuz my game is cold
I like to talk about you hoes in my rhyme
Chea hoe, I'll be back in Ninety Fzour with the rest hoe</pre>
