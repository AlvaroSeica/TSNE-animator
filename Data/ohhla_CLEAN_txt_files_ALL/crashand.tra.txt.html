[chorus 2x]
Crash and burn crash and burn crash and burn tonight
We're gonna keep on partying till the wake of daylight

[Tim Armstrong]
Rosy is a Puerto Rican porn star; that girl knows how to get down
Making money, making movies, lying horizontal dropping all her clothes on the ground
Then one said: "Wake up Tim, its midnight, its a city out there to go for a ride"
Like two vampires, we ride through the cities, we sleep as dogs backside
I don't give a fuck, never did never would, never could back down, not one time
So I'm gonna keep, making music, making records, keep telling people what's on my mind
I'm the same kid that I ever was even though I got platinum plaques on my walls
And I dress in black and it's a fact I don't give a goddamn at all

[chorus 2x]

[Rob Aston]
I think back to better days, took a license to ill
Before i ever held someone fell in love with the bills
Back before I had to ride and go hunt for a kill
Way before I tried to rhyme and go hunt for a kill
It's real survives with guns playing only from the shoulders
Wrong way down a one way still avoid the rollers
Still i beat a motherfucker like its going outta style
Tried to cheat me outta my cash so i beat it out his child
I'm wild, my pupils dilated same as my people
I'm the only mother present to build you a church steeple
Speak evil to the world teach all the boys and girls
That they can't trust no one, show them what you heard
Cause I mind my own business and I do my own dirt
And i make my own money cause I got my own work
I sware somebody better send a ceast and desist
Before i squeeze it with my fist and they cease to exist

[chorus 2x]

[Rakaa]
A party was a bash for how long it was lasted
Some turn cash like hash to ashes
some dash for hot slugs run the fastest
Who we fought to eat, unless we fasting
But thugs are not like most actors casted
Thugs might blast and smash your casket
America's worst fear, white, brown and black kids, together
fed up, strapped up to tatted
bald heads, jerry curls, classic perms, various sets that will flash off sherm
toast to a new day having its turn
tequila, the bottle is like a bath for worms
the paranoid, that's way past concerned
i hope the country and the world get past this term
this is show and tell, so the class will learn
party go until the cops come and crash and burn
