[Nino Brown]
Oh yeah
It's 'bout to be hell in this motherfucker
Chicano Pandrino clicka
Por vida
Motherfuckers

(Verse 1)
[Nino] Now we gon' separate the weak
       Who got the heat, we got the heat
       Ton' G, give me a sick beat, I smell defeat
       Dismiss, give me the chips, I make a bet
       Chicano
       Gambinos, that's my set
       Where you at, they call me Nino, who wanna scrap
       You wanna rap, I heard your demo, that shit was wack
       Watch your back, you're gettin' jacked and gettin' stiff
       This ain't no joke, take a toke, I'm blowin' smoke, punk
[Slow] Nino Brown, watch your back, these fools tryin' to creep
       We in this gangsta rap shit, knee deep
       You got my back, and I got yours
       You got a A.K. and I got a .44
       You rollin' in a Tahoe, I'm rollin' in a Caddy
       You workin' now, everyday, I'm puffin' on a Fedi
       Bump all these fools that don't know, you make money
       Fast and you live life slow
[Nino] Now who's the baddest, check ya status, don't slip
       Remember, I'm too slick, and too sick
       It's that original, criminal, from way back
       O.G.'s, round me, the family
       Mad I got a new trick, up my sleeve
       So dope, I make you sick, like dry heat
       Say please, por favor, that's Spanish
       Understand it, we comin' with the shit, doin' damage

Hook:
[Nino] You overdid it, holmes, you in the danger zone
[Slow] Fuckin' with them eastsiders, straight riders
[Nino] You overdid it, holmes, you in the danger zone
[Slow] Fuckin' with them eastsiders, straight riders

(Verse 2)
[Slow] We like Daz and Kurupt, Dre and Snoop
       Cube and Mack 10, but we two Mexicans
       Slow Pain and Big Nino, Chicano Gambinos
       Mero mero money estylo, stackin' C-notes
       Studio hijack, platinum sales
       First contact, million dollar combat, catch me in the limo
       Throwin' up G-spots extraordinaire
       Sportin' fifty thousand dollar Cartier
[Nino] Seen somebody panic, they gettin' frantic, aw damnit
       I heard somebody crack a joke, they gettin' smoked
       Who wanna fuck with these, don't do it
       You can't do it, plus I'm on my third fifth of the fluid
       Screw it, they wanna test, homey, get the vest
       And the Smif-n-Wes'
       Little rookie, take ya last breath
       I smell a rat, where he at, I get the strap
       Got him on the scope {*imitates gun cock*}
       BOOM GOP
[Slow] While you rappin' just to pay your rent
       I'm shown in my back with my dead presidents
       It makes no sense, homey
[Nino] Perro, what you mean
[Slow] Fool, I'm a true money fiend, sticky green
       Pounds and burns, and triple beams
       Bahamas for a month, then we hit the Keys
       Now you could be a dream rapper, on the microphone
       My finger on the trigger, now you in the zone
