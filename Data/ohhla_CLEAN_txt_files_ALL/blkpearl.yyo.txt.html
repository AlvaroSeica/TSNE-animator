(Intro)
Black Pearl, Precious little girl
Let me lift you up where you belong

(Verse 1)
Comin at'cha, can you feel what I'm feelin'
Some soul sister need some natural healing
Gifted but shifted, so come follow me
Cause I'ma take you on a sister to sister journey
Run to get mine, better get 'fore they grab it
Like cold pepsi-cola, gotta say I gots-ta have it
Stayin back too long, when you really got it goin' on
It ain't nothing wrong with being strong, but you don't hear me though

(Chorus)
Black Pearl, Precious little girl
Let me lift you up where you belong
Black Pearl, Precious little girl
You've been in the background much too long

(Verse 2)
Now, all my sisters with the bangles, tryin' on earings
Tryin shopping with the Fendi's and ain't got a penny
High school drop-out, only sixteen like she don't know no better
Don't think it's a crime, cause nobody's there to tell her
Life is scarce, if you don't take a chance you're losin honey
The streets'll be the only place you make your money
Let's get it together, that's the price you have to pay
And if you live for the streets you'll see a better day
One nation, under the groove, we got it open
If we'd just learn to stick together, you know what I mean?
Stop killin' each other, learn to love each other
For the sake of a mother and a brother
Run to get mine, better get 'fore they grab it
Like cold pepsi-cola, gotta say I gots-ta have it
Stayin back too long, when you really got it goin' on
It ain't nothing wrong with being strong, but you don't hear me though

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
What I'm kickin ain't no joke, you better listen up
Black black pressure, and pretty black pearl
Yeah, I done been around the world and it's still all the same
Everybody's still got a little shame in they game
Scared to admit, well here's something you can lean on
Hum the chorus to this song...
It's a lot of strings attched don't let him play you like a buppy
You gotta stay above it or your just like the rest of 'em
Following some dry-ass dream, scared to move on and be more than you friends
Self-motivation, for your self-motivate set the two
Black Pearl's dedicated from Yo to you
Run to get mine, better get 'fore they grab it
Like cold pepsi-cola, gotta say I gots-ta have it
Stayin back too long, when you really got it goin' on
Now tell me what's wrong with being strong

(Chorus till fade...)</pre>
