[DJ Quik]
Yes! Tony Toni Tone, and DJ Quik
You didn't think we could flip it on yo' ass, huh?
Something for the dance floor, in a real way
It's going down like this forever, and a day

Now what you hear is not a drag
Cause Mr DJ Quik got a brand new bag
But first I gotta bang bang, a boogie for the boogie
To the rhythm of the ghettoey streets, check it out now
You trying to give me some Eightball but no way
I'd rather have a Mimosa with Cristal and OJ
Yeah, just a little something bubbly and tingly
To have me walking around nekkid, but wait a second

[Raphael Saadiq]
The function's on, around midnight
What time is it, are you inside?
Available, to come and play
Give me a clue
So I don't have to look for you

[Chorus]
Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down, in my black Chevrolet
Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down, let's get down

[DJ Quik]
Now we don't need a club, we can do it at my house
My front door's open so homeys can bust it out
Ladies, if you're coming leave your children at the nursery
So you can slow grind the anniversary
Feel me? I dip dip da
So don't be looking stupid when I unfasten your bra
You know you want to mack this
Because I come stronger than the IRS
Whenever you done got delinquent on your taxes

[Raphael Saadiq]
Now here I am, staring at you
I need a drink, you need one too
Who is your friend, she don't look nice
But I know she will, later on tonight
Come on, let's get down

[Chorus]

[DJ Quik]
Now I'm at the club and I'm off that drug
The one they call 'alcohol' got me acting y'all
I hump two freaks before I hump two more
And now I'm throwing up my guts out the car door
Over consumption, you know how it is y'all
Got your homey begging for some Pepto-Bismol
But when my stomach's right I'll be back tonight
To get that lady I was grinding on the wall, feel me

[Raphael Saadiq]
Now that I feel a little better
Than I felt a little while ago, yeah
I'm going back to the same spot
Where I met you on the floor
Now table one, that's my folks
And table two, that's my folks
And everybody knows my name (What's up, Saadiq?)
Now table three, that's B. Grand
And table four that's G-One
You best be prepared
Cause it's all a game, you know

Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
In my black Chevrolet

[Dwayne Wiggins]
I gotta get my groove on (keep movin' and groovin', movin' and groovin')
I gotta get my groove on (keep shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass, uh)
I gotta get my groove on (keep movin' and groovin', movin' and groovin')
I gotta get get my groove on (keep shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass)
I'm groovin' (say what?), Movin' (yeah), Yeah

[Chorus until fade]</pre>
