Knock Knock Knock

...

How horrid to be buried alive
Imagine the terror of being trapped in your own coffin
Your heart beating wildly, every gasping breath
Using up your valuable oxygen

My hand popped up out of the dirt
Crawling out with broken wrists that dont even hurt
My blood wont squirt it's rusty.. dry
A milipede made it's home in my eye
I'll get by till the wicked Halloween
I'm howl-ing straight dogs follow me
I'm coming home dead man walking
My feet flop Clown Walkin' might make a beat drop
Spend twenty-five years I'm chewing on gum
Wait, I got none I'm chewing on my tongue
Walk, oh my leg snapped off at the knee
I beat a kid in the head with it and stoled his candy
drag myself all the way to my old block
There go my old house, I go "knock"
Trick or treat, some chick opened it up
I stabbed her in the gut, started choking the slut

What happened to the wicked shit
cuz we all walk in Hellawicked
yeah, it's time to get blood
and we get blood in it!
It's time to get blood
and we get blood everywhere!

What happened to the wicked
This real Wicked Hellawicked
Yeah it's time to get blood
and we get blood in it!
It's time to get blood
and we get blood everywhere!

Extremely often, I'm laying in my coffin
but this Halloween the lid's comin' off son
A dead ninja got work to put in
and quite a few assholes to put a foot in
it's been twenty years, I wonder where my bitch at
My dick's still intact, I wanna hit that
aint shit buddy, and this aint a costume
I only live under the light of the Moooon!
Lookin for the bitch in the phonebook
but my only one good eye, it wont work
finally found the address, I'm going there
Lookin like a big Yoda, but I dont care
rang the doorbell with a dead ass rose
long ass worm hangin outta my nose
my bitch got older, look like mick Foley
I killed her, cuz I refuse to die lonely!
come on bitch!

What happened to the wicked shit
This real Wicked Hellawicked
It's time to get blood
and we get blood in it!
It's time to get blood
and we get blood everywhere!

What happened to the wicked
This real Wicked Hellawicked
I'ts time to get blood
and we get blood in it!
It's time to get blood
and we get blood everywhere!

Bring, bring, bring that shit back (the wicked)
bring that shit back
the wicked, Hellawicked
bring, bring, bring that shit back (the wicked)
the wicked shit back (the wicked)
Hellaween

What happened to the wicked
This real Wicked Hellaween
It's time to get blood
and we get blood in it!
It's time to get blood
and we get blood everywhere!

What happened to the wicked
This real Wicked Hellaween
It's time to get blood
and we get blood in it!
It's time to get blood
and we get blood everywhere!
