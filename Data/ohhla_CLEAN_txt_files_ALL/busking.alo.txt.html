Typed by: AZ Lyrics

come on bus
come on bus
come on bus
are you coming here for me?

come on bus
come on bus
come on bus
there's somewhere I gotta be

See I've been waiting for this bus
I've been waiting for this bus for such a long time

now I don't know if it will ever show
guess I might as well just take another line
see I'm late
I gotta date
I need to get myself down town by quarter to 3
and I don't know
If this bus gonna show
I don't know if its gonna show on time for me

come on bus
come on bus
come on bus
are you coming here for me

come on bus
come on bus
come on bus
there's somewhere I gotta be

there's my bus
I'm about to go,I'm about to go right to where I gotta be
there's my bus,I'm about to go
there's my bus.
my bus's gonna come and get me</pre>
