Typed by: Tha Masta

{*Suga Bang Bang harmonizing*}

[Chorus x2: Suga Bang Bang]
The universe is turning 'round and around
The everyday struggles..
The universe is turning 'round and around
I think it's time to Shut 'Em Down!

[Suga Bang Bang]
I said I get grown wit ya wit ya, send hot shots to ya to ya
Which one of you cowards think Bang won't get ya?
The hood don't only talk, we'a ball it out
Brownsville thugs do is pull it out
I bet you twenty one and gun, I still won't run
I be the last man standing, banging my cannon
Showing love for me, love to you so-called thugs
I only stepped to stay on top of my game
Buddha made the track, and I'ma manage that
Banging ain't easy but I tell you for sure it's fun
And I'm always gonna stay true, cuz still gon' shine
And if you don't own no shield, you know no good
I know them niggaz that'll leave you laying in the hood

[Chorus x2]

[Popa Chief]
So this is what it boils down to
Blow the lid off for any and all costs
Exploit any and all flaws
Extort the boss, cut the tail and the legs off
Hostile talk, thug rap's a rip off
Singapore, sing ya whore
No need for more, cuz that's what she's good for
Rip a fool out for selling me fake kind
The world took a crap on a landmine
Governments still wanting more than half of mine
Baby mama's purse, heard it through the grape vine
Bill is intertwined, everyday struggle and grind
Good times, hard times, made me a great mind

[Chorus]

[Buddha Monk]
For the love of my niggaz, I do anything
Walk with the heat next to the dick gang
Cock and aim, squeeze five to the brain
Leave wife with her last name and shoot dice after my gun game
Shit be so sweet it be like Sug' with the Bang
And I know they taught you Buddha Monk got a nasty aim
Less them best out with murders 3/4ths of the night
That's why I sleep with the heat and open up this one eye
Y'all pussies come and try and bet, do to the die
Where it's a natural thing in Brooklyn to take ones life
Twenty years done, bet I was looking dead in the eye
It's the way of the 'Stuy to the day that we die, niggaz

[Chorus x3]
