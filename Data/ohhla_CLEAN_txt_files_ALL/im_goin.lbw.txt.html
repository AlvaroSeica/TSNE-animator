Song:   I'm Goin Outta My Mind
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I'm going outta my mind my mind
trying to juggle being a celebrity and living all of my life there?
I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind my mind
trying to just being with one woman instead of havin five
I'm going outta my mind my mind
man it's hard to trust anybody I don't trust these niggas
I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind
beathing these front days see my views come and walk in my shoes

[Verse 1]
niggas want favors niggas want hand outs
mandatory for me to help my mans out
got niggas in and outta jail paying all their lawyer fees
and youd think all this shit be far away from me
and I'm smokin even more now my city thinkin i've turned on 'em
never was the case and I'm a always have love for 'em
trying to digest all of this pressure
too young to be going through under pressure

[Chorus]
I'm going outta my mind my mind
trying to juggle being a celebrity and living all of my life there?
I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind my mind
trying to just being with one woman instead of havin five
I'm going outta my mind my mind
man it's hard to trust anybody I don't trust these niggas
I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind
beathing these front days see my views come and walk in my shoes

[Verse 2]
I got a girl I'm trying to lock down trying to do my grown man
dealing with depression I done felt that with my best friend
got 2 sisters ain't seen them forever
havent spoken to my grandmother I know she feels neglected
just because you see me go hard pop bottles don't mean I don't have bad days
my own problems shiit 23 years old
but sometimes I feel liked i've been here before

[Chorus]
I'm going outta my mind my mind
trying to juggle being a celebrity and living all of my life there?
I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind my mind
trying to just being with one woman instead of havin five
I'm going outta my mind my mind
man it's hard to trust anybody I don't trust these niggas
I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind
beathing these front days see my views come and walk in my shoes

[Verse 3]
everytime I was 22 shit got hectic
biggest call of my life I never would forget this
I'm on the movie set I get a call my girl pregnant
holding my composuree but I'm feeling breathless
thinkin bout my fans thinkin bout my careers
tryin to make the best move what do I do from here
so much lieing on this young man
It's even crazy when you got the world in your hands

[Chorus]
I'm going outta my mind my mind
trying to juggle being a celebrity and living all of my life there?
I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind my mind
trying to just being with one woman instead of havin five
I'm going outta my mind my mind
man it's hard to trust anybody I don't trust these niggas
I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind
beathing these front days see my views come and walk in my shoes

[bridge: talking in background]
It ain't easy being me
packets of celebritys more than heavily
It ain't easy being me
packets of celebritys more than heavily
It ain't easy being me
packets of celebritys more than heavily
It ain't easy being me
packets of celebritys more than heavily

[Chorus]
I'm going outta my mind my mind
trying to juggle being a celebrity and living all of my life there?
I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind my mind
trying to just being with one woman instead of havin five
I'm going outta my mind my mind
man it's hard to trust anybody I don't trust these niggas
I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind
beathing these front days see my views come and walk in my shoes</pre>
