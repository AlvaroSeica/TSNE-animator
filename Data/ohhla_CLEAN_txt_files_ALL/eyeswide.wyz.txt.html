Song:   Eyes Wide Shut
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Tangled in the webs that she weaves
Dangling in disbelief, trapped I can't breathe
She's the one that left me
Stranded feelin' empty
Now I'm all alone reading the letters that she sent me

Tired of playing games
Tired of being in last place
I move to fast pace, who are you to judge
If only you can love the way you hate me, every things so shaky
Broken, lost, crushed, all the above
Too many mistakes, too many bad breaks and bad luck
Too many lies and closed eyes, now I'm stuck in a bad rut
You said you'd be committed from the beginning 'till end
I can't believe you said we're better off just being friends

I can't believe this
You can just walk away
I can't believe this
Each and every other day
I can't believe this
Now my mind is blown
I can't believe
That I am all alone

[Chorus]
EYES, into a place that I take you
WIDE, you see I just can't replace you
SHUT, and now my heart it breaks in two
Follow, follow, Eyes Wide Shut

You thought you left me empty handed, stranded and broken hearted
Mistreated and cheated so take it back to where we started
To the first time we met and the first time we kissed
Together forever, well what have I missed
If only you can see just how I feel and what you mean to me
I never thought that you could walk away so easily
You said you needed space, now you're out hanging with him
You said we can't be lovers so I know we can't be friends

I can't believe this
You can just walk away
I can't believe this
Each and every other day
I can't believe this
Now my mind is blown
I can't believe
That I am all alone

[Chorus (2X)]

Just the other day
I looked at her, she looked at me and then she walked away
'Cause I never really understood why
She could pass me by without giving us another try
So tell me what you're looking for
'Cause I don't know no more
All I know is that I feel just like my hearts been torn
And I thought I was more than just a friend
And now you're leaving me in the very end
And my vision is a blur
All I really know is that I loved her, I loved her

I can't believe this
You can just walk away
I can't believe this
Each and every other day
I can't believe this
Now my mind is blown
I can't believe
That I am all alone

[Chorus (2X)]</pre>
