[Frank Ocean]
I told her that I missed her, I put her on that plane
Go young love, it's just a product of the fame
I told her that I dug her, I wasn't runnin game
And if she left a nigga, I wouldn't be the same
She met me at the W, grabbed me by my chain
Then kissed me like she meant it, so glad she came
Told me she was in love, she wasn't running game
And since she got off the plane, she didn't feel the same

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I made a change for my baby, a difference for love
And I ain't frontin, feel like you were the one
that got the riiiing
Girl if you want could have my name, girl if you want
See baby I've been lookin so long
Thought you liked it then I'm sure you wasn't feelin it at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
Girl I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
If you've been searchin so long
You knew that other lover wasn't feelin them at all
Cause baby youse a sucker for love, a sucker for love
A sucker for love, a sucker for love

[Frank Ocean]
Whoah.... so we're lovin in the winter, flaming in the rain
The only one I'm into, never gonna change
Cause when I said I dug her, I wasn't running game
Since she been rocking with me, the crush has been insane
She's a 1 of 1, D color VVS stone
My precious you're my everything, please don't leave me 'lone
She told me she was so sprung, I never was a lame
And that the feeling's so good. she wish that it would stay

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Whoah....
Love, said I only think about her when I wake up
Ohhhhhhh yeah
We did it for love, we did it for love, love, love
