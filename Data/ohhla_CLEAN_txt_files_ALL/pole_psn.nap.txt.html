[Chorus: Scales + (girl)]
(La la la la la la la la la)
Round and around the pole she goes
(La la la la la la la la la)
Round and around the pole she goes

[Verse: Scales + (girl)]
Yo, uh, uh, yo
Uh, I don't want it from the back
I wanna see the pretty face when I hit it like that (like that?)
Scales's on 'tack, club, out the clothes
We can take it to the 'lac, we can do it in the back
Hey girl, that's fat (what?)
If I hit that you gonna keep comin' back
Like this that crack
Hey damn you stacked
Your momma hates sin
And your daddy's just black, I'll leave it at that
I keep it intact, keep it exact
New pair of shoes with the elegant straps (okay)
Do what I do is an intelligent mack
I'll beat it like that, then treat it like that (oh)
Then skeet it like that
Taste this here, now eat it, right
Hold on, hold on, my mom might hear this
(No, go on, say it)
Nah, it's nasty
Quit that, uh

[Chorus: B. Stille + (girl)]
(La la la la la la la la la)
Round and around the pole she goes
(La la la la la la la la la)
Round and around the pole she goes

[Verse: Skinny + (girl)]
Shit shorty, lookin' like a barbie
Doll on the pole, shakin' ass for the dough (what's up?)
We blow with a pocket full of ones
She's cold, lookin' hotter than the sun
Thick thighs, ass in a thong
Gotta get a lap dance at the end of the song
I'm tricked on my singles and the momma was gone
She dead wrong and the game hits strong
Hang on, let me break another hundred (wanna dance?)
Hit the ATM for to get some more money
Bartender, let me another Grand Marn-ier
Just got paid
Shorty, I know you been here all day
Can I get a dance, the next drink's on me
What's your name? (Baby)
Damn you're a pretty thing, do what the nigga sayin'

[Chorus: B. Stille + (girl)]
(La la la la la la la la la)
Round and around the pole she goes
(La la la la la la la la la)
Round and around the pole she goes

[Verse: B. Stille]
Get low, clean that pole
Climb up fast, slide down slow (that's right)
Girl, teach that class
Make that cash, shake that ass (all night)
I'ma trip on my honey dip
Dip 'til my money clip empty (what's good?)
Enough with that young shit
Wanna quit tryin' to tempt me? (let's do it)
Tell me how you gon' act
Follow you to the back
Like I'm glued to your back, girl (who's the mack?)
We can cruise in the 'lac
While we groove to the track
But due to the fact
I done blew through a stack
Let a dude hit the cat
What you know 'bout this pimpin'? (get paid)
I'ma spin this track when I put you in pole position
(Now swing)

[Chorus: B. Stille + (girl)]
(La la la la la la la la la)
Round and around the pole she goes
(La la la la la la la la la)
Round and around the pole she goes

[Bridge: girl + (B. Stille)] (2X)
La la la la la la la la la
Better shake that thing
Better work that pole
Better get that dough, oh
Better shake that thing
Better work that pole
Better get that dough, oh
(Round and around the pole she goes)</pre>
