[Hook x5]
Somebody gotta pay, I been on this block all day
Tryin' to get off all this yay

[Verse 1]
I'm the boardman bitch but let me tell ya how I came up
Cooked a lot of that raw, never sold that fake stuff
Cutthroat cha' if ya try to bring me some harm
Don't look at me wrong cause I'll be bustin' ya long
Blunbt smoke with the rocks in my mouth, see all dirty
Gotta see my P.O. tomorrow on a hot Thursday
But today I'ma make it bump around the way
I lay K off in the grass so ya better not play
If ya just jumped off the porch I'ma slam ya
If ya talkin' crazy nigga I'ma have to handle ya
If it's real I can serve ya, we can do a little business
Keep it on the low when we straight I'ma hit chu' with that issue
As long as I got narcotics make me richer
Before I stop I'ma blow up the block this year

[* Explosion *] (x7)

[Verse 2]
Do I have to speak any further
Fuckin' with me and my loot then it's gonna be a murder
I creep in ya house like a burglar
Do you really think it's a game, you lame
When bullets flame you gon' be the next nigga unnamed
What cha' heard, my click can't be flamed, crazy in the brain
Yes we do get into this hustle so don't fuck with out brains
On the block is where I hang
In the same fit for three weeks
For this goof that steal my money race like a track meet
On a Friday ain't no heat, only if you got beef
It's about to be a X for nigga tryin' to hit a ho with that bare meat
In the streets it's known that we got em' anything can happen
I'ma make it so the crack and rap and hustlin' is happenin'

[Hook x5]

[Verse 3]
I jumped off in tha game back in 96
Nigga hit me three bricks, nigga post that list
Servin' Boxcar Ramone, that nigga was kissed
I used to give him two stones just to test my shit
Got my first piece of pussy in a project hallway
Pussy to the gun play, we can play all day
Smokin' big weed, keep my conscience clear
P.O. bitch touched me now I'm back on a tear
I can't wait to see them niggas when they see my face
Give my lawyers six figures now they droppin' the case
When I was small big niggas on the block would ball
I had to look up to em' like they was 20 feet tall
Fuck y'all I'm stack my tips, take these hits
Fuck a thick bitch in a brand new six
Now it's Friday, like a ho to do it my way
Only do the speed limit and a third on the highway
