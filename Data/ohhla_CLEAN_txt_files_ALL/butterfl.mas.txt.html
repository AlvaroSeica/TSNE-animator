Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Weightless falls honeysuckle
Strangers (strange this)
Lights from pages
Paper thin thing

Protected by the naked eye
Pearly sunrise

Nearly worn
Kneeling like a supplicant
Darkened skin
Afraid to see
Radiate
Open lips
Keep smiling for me
Darkened skin
Afraid to see
Radiate
Open lips
Keep smiling for me

Weightless cool honeysuckle
Fair skin freckles
Uncut teeth
Tranquill eyes
Bite my lips
Bite my lips
Shhh
Under your feet</pre>
