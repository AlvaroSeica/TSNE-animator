(chorus)
until tomorrow
wait until tomorrow comes
until tomorrow
everything's gonna be okay
until tomorrow
wait until tomorrow comes
until tomorrow
everything's gonna be okay

it never fails to be surprising
I wait to see the sun peeking over the horizon
when nothing seems to matter anymore
the problems of the world shut down
take a look around
everything's pure
it'll never be the way it was before
now I see the future knocking at my front door
with everything I ever wanted and more
more than I wanted to see
and nothing seemd out of my reach
it all lasted for a split second
reality made it feel like a mixed message
and now I'm hoping all the working doesn't go to waste
living with my life sitting in the hands of faith
I know nobody really knows the truth of what awaits
but as long as we survive then what difference does it make
we live to tell
I'mma do whatever that it takes
I know that nothing's promised but we need a little faith
an angel said to me

chorus

you can lean on me
you know that I'll remember everything you told me
she said that on my journey there will always come a day
every now and then it rains but it's never here to stay
you're getting' high 'cause you got a lot on your mind
problems don't go away they're only pacified
you're gonna get enough of keeping it bottled up inside
gotta open up your eyes if you wanna feel alive
just follow me
I'mma lead you out of harms way
you gotta do as I do and do as I say
I'll take you to the door but you make your own decisions
it's hard to ignore when you ask for forgiveness
I'll give you everything you want
everything you need
as long as you can tell me you'll continue to believe
I'mma be your certainty's
I'mma be your doubts
in every situation I provide a way out
and then you said to me

chorus

until tomorrow...
everything's gonna be okay...
until tomorrow comes...
be okay...</pre>
