Yeah, once upon a time not long ago, my grandmother told me one day I'd change
I felt like she was comin down on me, so I told her no, I'd be the same
Not knowin she was only tryin to help, motivate me to excel and climb
I was thinkin she was the one trapped, while I was stuck in the cage of my mind
Man if I would've known what I know now
I would've brought my head down out of that cloud
Told her thank you, and that I loved her, but I was too cool, and too damn proud
What a fool I was in fact, I've changed so much now lookin back
I wish somebody I thought was cool was as cool as she was when she told me that

[Chorus]
I see you, the real you
Tryin to cover up, what's inside of you
But everything you do, is make believe
Yeah you're hot, but you're too cool
I see youuuuuuuuu, whoa-oh-whoa-ohhh
Whoa-oh-whoa-ohhh-ohhhhh
I see youuuuuuuuu, whoa-oh-whoa-ohhh
Whoa-oh-whoa-ohhh-ohhhhh
I see youuuuuuuuu

Baby girl don't know much about, what it would take to become a star
Hollywood is so farfetched, too long of a drive in an old car
Work every day but you barely eat, goin over lines from a script you read
Your boyfriend said it's a silly dream
But how can you dream when you never sleep?
You're lookin in the mirror, and you're picturin a light show
A glimpse in the lens of a camera, behind the scenes of life as a tightrope
Yeah you walk a thin line, but a thin line is all you need
A thin line in an indie movie, just a break for somebody to see
the talent inside, the ballad of a diary you write, the by and by
is just another day for a normal girl but for you it's another day that you tried
Aside from the fact that you ride 
in the back of a bus sometimes cause your car won't work
Well maybe you should take that bus to L.A., and put your dreams first
Because

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
Black and white, everything is black and white, broke down simple and plain
Most of us lost with a curious brain, curiosity is looked at as strange
Stuck in a lane but you can't complain, while you look at another passin train
Wonderin how, where's it goin? Wishin you were inside, packed and rollin
to another place but your time is chosen
To live low-key cause your dream is stolen
They don't understand, they believe in loathin, loungin loafin, waitin hopin
Homie if the grass is greener, look, the gate is open
You're waitin for God to release the ocean
Sittin on the beach two feet from floatin
But I see you

[Chorus]
