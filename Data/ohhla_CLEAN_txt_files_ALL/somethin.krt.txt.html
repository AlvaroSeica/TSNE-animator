"Something", Yeah
Young Krizzle third coast representer
right now the rap game "got a hold on me"
but it's cool cause it's my movement, you dig
and if you don't believe in "something" then you'll fall for anything
and that's the type of shit that, "is bothering me"
cause this industry'll get you fucked up you dig
so stay cool now "whatever it is" you want to do with your life nigga do it
make sure you can't leave it alone cause I can't "I cant leave it alone no"
300 representa pimpin

I always knew that it was "something"
in my heart that got me trippin today
like yesterday it ain't no different 
the struggle "got a hold on me"
and I can't breathe nowadays, I wanna leave nowadays
but lord I'm knowing that it's "something"
in this music and in my soul
the thought I might not blow this shit just keeps on "bothering me"
and I don't know how long I can keep on like this
I need a sign so "whatever it is"
I'm meant to do I need to find it cause the game is addictive
and I ain't gettin out it cause I "cant leave it alone no" 
I tried and I tried but it keep calling me back
yeah they keep calling me back
because it's "something" in my music that makes'em feel me
the sweetest melody sometimes can heal me cuz "got a hold on me"
like my grandmas hands when I was younger warmer than summer then I knew 
it was "something" that was bigger than the money and the fame
the fact that so many could change "keeps bothering me"
yeah, but who am I to judge
It's been a while since I did it for the lord but

"whatever it is" I gotta pay for
sometimes happiness the only thing I pray for
"I cant leave it alone no" 

the will to ask questions like how could George Bush recieve blessings 
but I'm knowing that it's "something" or some things that I cannot explain 
forget forgive the change and the pain "got a hold on me"
I got a gun to keep me safe, sometimes I drink and smoke to get away
because its "something", that I know aint right
pops forgive me but this cant be life and its "bothering me" 
because I wanna do better but this rain seem to pour forever
so "whatever it is"
I fiend for it, think of it speak on it wish for it dream of it and lord
"I cant leave it alone no" no, I can't leave it alone

and she said it was "something" that drawed you to me and it's meant to be
and you the only one that ever ever ever "got a hold on me" yeah,
but you aint been the same, there was something that made you change
so tell me it was "something" or someone that made you feel good
or way better than I ever could
truth is "its bothering me" but I'm cool with it 
just know if it's over today that you did it
"whatever it is" don't let it take you to your grave
protect yourself from AIDS
I know you want me to but "I can't leave it alone no" 
I knew I couldn't turn this house of lies into a home and that said 
it's "something" that I've done to make you leave
baby girl why you tripping can't you see 
that you always "got a hold on me"
and I don't know what I can say
to make you stay but I know I gotta say "something" 
but now and then I get tired of you packing your bags
and all this drama it's "bothering me"
and I don't need it on my mind lately you've been like this all the time 
so "whatever it is" you feeling guilty
bout go and spit it out why you accusing me
you must be cheating cause you can't "leave it alone no" why you crying? 
see you can't deny it, I always had this feeling it was "something"
that god gave me as a gift, the power to make words fit.

I look at the sky, and dream of soaring just as high
but as time goes by it always "something" 
that'll knock me off my track, got to get back
cause time is short, hey, you feel it
and I don't know how long I can keep on like this I need a sign so

"whatever it is" I gotta pay for it
sometimes happiness the only thing I pray for
"I can't leave it alone no" 

the will to do better as a man 
I can't struggle forever because its "something"
It's always something man, "got a hold on me" that's got a hold on me, ha
real shit for real niggas
real shit for real people, you know
it keeps bothering me
that people dont want to hear no real shit no more
but whatever it is "whatever it is"
I gotta spit to get it to them to get to they mind 
I can't stop cause "I can't leave it alone no" I gotta spit this message
cause I'm about something, ha...</pre>
