[Lord Quas]
I know you're tired of dumb shit so check this here
I see the neck-breaking, butt-shaking freaks of this year
Yeah! So peep the steelo of how it go
Your neck turnin cause your head already know
So pass that {KNAHMSAYN} and watch Quas dip fast
And have honies back in the Jeep catchin whiplash
Backs - so fat - have you all on smile
Take my dick to the motel, do things to make you raise your eyebrows
I'm cummin/comin soon, y'all about to get..
So hit that poon, but protect your {dick}
Eject - wrong! I'm still stabbin with my prong
I be blowin up lots, you'd be thinkin he was sittin on a nail bomb
Uhh, stay on and keep rockin please
I feel sorry for the blind men, cause {niggaz} ain't seein these
Acting! We roll with bad Timbs, or basics
After I'm down I pass it off to the next faces

[Chorus]
She has her your head turnin cause she knows her backs is fat
Shake it up like this, and a little like that
She got your head turnin cause her face ain't whack
But move on like this, and then like that
She got your head turnin, but she look like a snack
Now it's on like this, and then like that
She got your head turnin cause her backs is fat
Shake it up like this, and then like that

[Lord Quas]
Them backs pack energy like nuclear reactors
My name is Lord Quas and this be the Broad Factor
After, please don't choose me - I'll take a Coke
(Look) the girl here over there I be in stroke
No jokes, I see tan lines and start aimin mines
That girls so fine, a hundred dumb niggaz in line
Bumped into my old ex-girl, now we blendin
Menage-a-trois and don't say jack, nso I'm quiet like a ninja
I enter, freaks, so you should expect (what?)
To practice yoga so we can get other postions set
We got sexed up, and guess what? I'm the one that hit it
You won't neglect it, my jim be employin paramedics
I get it - yeah and it'll stay that way
I know you'll be back, you know I got some dimes on layaway
And I'll be here freaking fly honeie that make you sway
Do me a favor (what's that?) Tell your girl I ain't been a gay

[Chorus]</pre>
