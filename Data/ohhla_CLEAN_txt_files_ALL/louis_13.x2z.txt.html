[Xzibit]
Never has it been this bright
Gotta tell bitches, get out of my sight
Bitch, you're blocking my light

[King Tee]
Ha ha ha, I'm in Vegas, front seat at the fight
I'm an Alcoholic, so you know I'm getting it right

[J-Ro]
Louis the 13th

[E-Swift]
Hennessy black when I'm thirsty
I like my liquor, dark milk chocolate Hershey

[Xzibit]
But first we, gotta bang loose
For the niggaz that's been waiting on it
Patiently debating, even hating on it, bitch

[King Tee]
I started this gangster shit
House shoes and the shotgun, check the pinks

[Xzibit] The hangover is over, Tila created Tha Liks

[King Tee] So tell the whole world to suck my dick!!

[E-Swift]
Real shit, the addiction that you can't deny
Twelve steps to recovery, or else you die

[Xzibit]
Yeah, this is for you and I
Fly, pelican, fly, fuck trying to get by
Or we can put that bullshit to the side and kill them

[J-Ro]
L-B Cool S
Put a flicker out in Sweden out in a H&amp;M dress

[Tash]
So what makes a motherfucker so damn fresh?

[Xzibit] We on the coast, yeah, you know to the left

[J-Ro]
Louis the 13, back down original, pack-town originator
I'm full of Forties like the G-Thang refrigerator

[Tash]
Getting paper with my neighbors like that Clippers and the Lakers
Drinking Jac' next to Jack, courtside at the Staples

[Xzibit]
Affiliation is vital for survival, we rolling
The caravan pull it up with a million trucks

[King Tee]
And I'm feeling like a million bucks
A all-star nigga still in chucks

[J-Ro]
Louis the 13th

[Tash]
You can say what you say, just spell Ca-Tash right
Still got a lot of Louis leftover from last night

[J-Ro]
We alcoholic minded, DJ rewind it
Bitches in liquor, we only fuck with the finest
King Tee your highness

[King Tee]
I'm timeless, y'all niggaz is spineless
Drinking everything on the wine list

[Xzibit]
So yeah nigga, come and catch this fade
Or break bread and we can all get paid

[J-Ro]
Louis the 13th

[E-Swift]
I got 14 courts, all sorts of imports
Premium spirits, mixed with marked lyrics

[Xzibit]
Don't fuck with Xzibit, I will crush your frame
Say my name, I will hunt you down like Saddam Hussein

[King Tee]
I'm crown royal, coming out the Compton soil
Niggaz in the kingdom stay loyal

[J-Ro]
It's the old English, linguist, distinguished genius
Always got a cup in my hand

[King Tee]
Louis the 13th

[Tash]
Let's have a conversation about my present situation
I don't need to be a star, I got my own constellation

[Xzibit]
Professional inebriation, we're having a celebration
A live nation and heavy rotation

[E-Swift]
Patience, Hold more information than a free mason
It's a secret society, never try sobriety

[J-Ro]
SS Bugatti, live with the Illuminati
Crawling on your corner, picking up the bodies

[Xzibit] We crash the party

[King Tee] Low lows and Harley's

[Tash] Mixed with Bacardi

[E-Swift] Man, fuck everybody

[King Tee]
Yeah, and I'm feeling like a million bucks
To all my real niggaz raise your cups

[E-Swift]
Louie the 13</pre>
