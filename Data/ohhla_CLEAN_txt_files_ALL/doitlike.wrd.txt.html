My styles funny eh? ha ha ha 
Ive got one style Ive got two style 

Do it like this (Do it like this) 
(You canny) Canny do it like this 
Do it like this (Do it like this) 
You cunts cant do it like this 

Jokers get a bat man I'm Robin 
All your damn shit from your kicks to your Walkman 
I take your bitch you prick and put cock in 
Just like Christmas got her in the stockings 
Do it often constantly bossing 
Dudes in the circle I rock like its moshing 
Fuck all your mocking I just keep talking 
Behind bars like your boy was in Saughton 
Locked in I got the nail in the coffin 
Bringing up green like you do when you coughing 
(Uh uh) flossing? (Uh uh) no often 
Like to get ice but really I'm just frosting 
Hot and though I rip beats often 
So a get strips like a damn street crossing 
Come on tits just bounce like you jogging 
Like gun crime ya cunt I keep popping 
Superhero you watching a Watchmen 
But cant see his face like he's Mr. Watson 
Be careful you might get a stomping 
I'm watch-in your ass like Chris Walken 
You Pulp Fiction I'm fact when I'm Knocking 
Cunts right back right bats they are copping 
Independent but not on Koch and 
Fuck a verse get the hook like boxing 

Do it like this (Do it like this) 
(You canny) Canny do it like this 
Do it like this (Do it like this) 
You cunts cant do it like this 

I'm fly I flew I drift 
I'm spew I'm flu I'm sick 
I'm the shit your not your just pish 
I'm tight like a knot I know I got this 
Yes and I rep Auld Reekie 
Shout out to Glasgow though I'm born Weegie 
Do it easy on E's man I'm easy 
Run around town with a blade in my sleeve eh 
You got a problem? Dont want to see me 
Put you in the box and I dont mean the TV 
Nah fools Ive more tools than Speedy 
Shit I will leak ye I dont mean a CD 
Check my C.V. no throwing up bee gees 
Nah but I got a buzz I'm the bee's knees 
Trying blow I just got a wee breeze 
And this is knout mate this is a freebie 

Do it like this (Do it like this) 
(You canny) Canny do it like this 
Do it like this (Do it like this) 
You cunts cant do it like this 

Like This, You get drowned out 
Cant hear yourself on the beat your not like me</pre>
