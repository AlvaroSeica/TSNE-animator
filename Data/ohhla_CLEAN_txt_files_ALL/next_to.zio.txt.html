I know I got a problem
It all started with me
I wanted something special wasnt what I thought it should be
It's never easy when you're growing up so passionately
Irrationally so your beauty wanted to be
Next to you
All I needed was your hands on my head
Ocean blue and your waters as you sawm in my bed
Got confused as we cuddled all the words that we said
Now im in a puddle with my heart bleeding red
Next to you
Was my pillow you assulting my touch
Next to you
Was a fellow didnt talk to much
Next to you
Was my joy puddy all in your clutch
Next to you
Was a boy with his feet getting stuck
In a maze full of feelings
Like I started to rush when I looked into your eyes saw a flower so crushed
Never knew I could have hurt you getting harder to trust
And I felt so insecure like I'm ready to bust
Next to you

Next to you
Another silly love sick fool
Do you wanna be with me? Think I want to be with you
Next to you
Don't know what I'm going to do
Do you want to be with me? Think I want to be with you
Another silly love sick fool
Do you wanna be with me? think i want to be with you
Next to you

I never said im perfect
I got some issues to solve
It's like a blew a circuit and planet earth still revolve
We in the land of serpents
And I know brothers could foul
Trying to find my purpose I hope you're feeling me now
I've travelled many places seen symbols and signs
It's like we're telepathic because you be reading my mind
I see you always glisten? I'm always peeing your shine
Deep in my heart i'm wishing commitment was on my mind
Next To you
Something beautiful eclispes with the moon
Next to you
something immuteable hits with a bomb
Next to you
Feeling selfish Cause I cant give it all
Next to You
We aint eating right up after the fall?
When I see over the other side I couldnt be wrong
When i hide away my fears I see the cracks in the door
Then we argue and we fuss and it doesnt take long
And I doubt about that love we made in the morn

Next to you
Another silly love sick fool
Do you wanna be with me? Think I want to be with you
Next to you
Don't know what I'm going to do
Do you want to be with me? Think I want to be with you
Another silly love sick fool
Do you wanna be with me? Think I want to be with you
Next to you

Hey...
Over analytic, you see a critic was born
on an October morning when my momma was strong
Searching in my heart to find it but I feel like a stone
Turned cold in the morn where I want to go home
Next to you
blowing kisses trying to make it alright
Next to you
Saying prayers I hope they last for a night
Next to you
I'm not a player let the loving be right
Gotta take a leap of faith if I want to take flight
Next to you....</pre>
