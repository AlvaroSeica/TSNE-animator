Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
What it look like bitch
I look like that and you look like this
I look like yes and you look like no
I keep me a bank roll and that bitch don't fold
20 thousand in these pocket got my chick on swove
They don't never tell me no any bitch gone go
Cause i look like that and you look like this
Im my all white car with my little white bitch

[Verse: Lil Reese]
40 with the 30 man don't make me hit the switch
Can't trust a fuck nigga looking like he wanna snitch
Take a nigga down then after that get off the shits
That forgi on my whip that why you bitches on my dick
What it look like bitch
30 in the clip I swear my clip is long as shit
300 my clique we small as shit
300 my circle small as shit
Only the fam I swear we never trust a bitch
Don't play with my brothers everybody we with the shits
Walk through the spots you see them joints be with the shits
So what it look like bitch

[Chorus: Chief Keef]

[Verse: Chief Keef]
Seen a hundred thousand what it look like this
Well your pockets empty they don't look like shit
I'm rolling round town got my little white bitch
Pretty red hair and her little white kicks
I got on my little white go
Ice on my wrist feel and look like snow
I pull up in my outty with them little white folks
She look like yes niggas look like no
I go by chief so
Got alot of white gold
Nigga ill take your soul
Cuz bitch I'm from the o

[Chorus: Chief Keef]</pre>
