{"Loving you is all I wanna do, I wanna do..."}

[Intro: Talib]
That's all I wanna do baby, I mean really
I mean I go out there, I work my whole life baby
I put it down for you, I put it down for our kids
See as a man, I ain't got no excuse baby
I'm the voice of the struggle (the voice of the struggle)
All I wanna do, is write love songs about you (wow)

[Talib Kweli]
Love is a drug
Love is the gift, love is the curse, love is the buzz
Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best
Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure
Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease
Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep
Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak
Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak
Love is so strong, take a hit, love is a drug
Love is the gift, love is the curse, love is the buzz
Love is the hunger, love is the thirst, love is the best
Love is the worst, love is perverse, love is to cure
Love is a freak, love is demure, love is a tease
Your love is certain, my love is pure, my love is deep
Love is a whore under the sheets, lover's peak
Love is so strong, love is weak, lover's peak
Love is so strong, love is reap (hey!)

[Outro: Talib]
Uhh, when you sayin love me, it doesn't
Hey, when you sayin love me, it doesn't matter uh
Hey, hey, when you sayin love me
Hey, when you sayin love me
Word, word, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter uh, c'mon!
Yeah, see babe, I got so much love to give
I don't got an ounce, I don't got grams
I got kilos of love
Kilo kilo kilo kilos of love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uhh
Uhh, uhh...
