[Intro]
Yeah, feel my pain
Filled with pain
It's a struggle everyday
Did I walk in the right door?
I don't know
Yeah

I never back down, I do what it takes me
Things gettin' shaky, can't let it break me
A lot love us, some hate me
Some friends snake me
Sometimes the shit just make me
Wanna grab the tote and lose it
It ain't just tracks and raps
It's a whole other side to music
Things you can't see on MTV, but it's here
Lord, what's happened to me?
I'm really out there
Was this the right door to walk in?
Lips movin', but ain't nobody talkin'
I plead and I cry to the Heaven skies above to show me love
Wish that I could backtrack and make it like it was, but I can't

1 - When the pain's in me
    I wish that it would let me be
    But where can I run and where do I turn
    When it's chasin' me?

Repeat 1

I got to deal with the what IS, fuck what IF's
Got to put it down and make it right for my kids
How many parties, how many bottles gotta pop?
How many more gots to die?
When this shit gon' stop?
I feel it in my heart, but I plays my part
It's a whole bigger picture so stay true to your art
Until I'm hauled off in the car
Swear it wasn't this dark when I got my start
Internin', been chart burnin', kept learnin'
Kept earnin', and the wheels kept turnin'
But after all the hit songs and the fame is gone
Your money right, but everything else done gone wrong
You're lonely, a lot of bitches is phony
Wanna know me just to tell niggas we homies
Whole time bitch schemin' on my Rolley
It's hard to watch everyone you with
When you rich, niggas with you try to get you
Plenty wanna hit you, I learned it now
It was no way out, now it's no turnin' around
Niggas that was with me, I praise 'em now
A toast to the Red Zone, raise 'em now

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Silence, all eyes on me
But I can see through 'em like I knew 'em, so I walk to 'em
Extend my hand, try to talk to 'em
Stand while others ran and try to understand
Two sides of a story, let me tell my side of it
It's evident, it's there, I can't hide from it
How much for the soul in the window?
Most wanna be rich and famous
It's dangerous, you'll find out in a minute though
I love the close ones, sometimes feel like I got no one
Those that was there, I know I owe 'em
Backstabbers, I brush 'em off
In a room with straight faces, can't trust 'em all
Rush and fall, pause, let nature take it's course
Stand firm cuz I serve a higher force
And I can scream 'til I'm hoarse, hear me Lord
See I'm ? like 3 dice, riskin' it all in street life

At the fork in the road, I made a hard right
I put the work in, then escaped the hard life
I put it down 'til it's time to lay me down
Wanna be free, but a lot of shit weighs me down
The light's dimmin', who gon' save me now?
It's all good, but it ain't gravy now
We gots to do it for the babies now
And bring 'em up to correct all the wrong we've done
And don't let 'em sing the same song we sung
Like, killin' each other off one by one
And turn 'em from slangin' the drugs, into some'in
You can make it out the ghetto in more ways than one
But for now I'mma pray for better days to come

Repeat 1
