[Chorus]
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change

[Verse 1]
Money change niggas, but I change money
Try to rob me, then you know some shots comin
Gbe, glory boys, we can't go for nothing
40 in my pocket, pick your ass right up it
Got a whole team, real niggas, we don't feel niggas
I ain't gotta shoot your eyes, tell my lil niggas
Sneak dissin and hatin on my downfall
I'm in the trap, movin packs the size of baseball
Ask out, jury's loyal, not a case closed
Niggas haters, when I pull up see they face froze
I be counting hunneds talking real pesos
Give a halo, your bitch want fredo

[Chorus]
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change

[Verse 2]
Sag my robin jeans, this is my polo draws
I can't change, realest nigga of them all
I'm a ball like I reminisce
These niggas round me, I can never miss
Real niggas in my ass be the team bitch
Just to be around, she gonn do the team quick
Me and Fredo, go up and lean shit
Rob will get you catus if you ain't in this
Got 3 hunder, that's my sum up
Watching all these hoes I grew up on
All chief wood, gotta pump us
We on the pump up, so don't get slumped up

[Chorus]
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change

[Verse 3]
Too many faces on me, I could hardly count it
All this money, all this cash, counting smoking sour
All these shots up in this choppa cause a bullet shower
All this money that I'm throwing, that's a money shower
Connect call, I'm done less than an hour
Money, respect and all that come with the power
G know molly I don't play, I sleep next to a llama
I get change, get change if you become a problem
All we know is rap come frm the product
If we ain't got it pull the cape, or just to solve the problem
All we know is rap come frm the product
If we ain't got it pull the cape, or just to solve the problem

[Chorus]
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change

[Verse 4]
Got a lot of change, it's me and my team
Steady counting franklins, the bitches know my name
Bout all control and got all the robin jeans
Don't mix me with the rappin, boy I clap east
Half these niggas fake cause they ain't in the streets
Signing checks, bitch I'm ballin with no receipts
Lots of foreign cars, riding round with foreign drops
Foreign thoughts were given born from ours, the other shots
Rose the more on them deuces fire bitch ain't so me I won't lie
'Cause my benz up and money fly
Flex on road 'cause you know why
No smoke in the streets we fly bitch chasing me I know why
'Cause my benz up and money fly
Flex on road 'cause you know why

[Chorus]
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change

[Verse 5]
I be counting faces, I don't take no fucking change
I just hit the cable just finessin on the same
If you don't know me, I ball all from the streets
Bitch you on the streets, fuck me don't want no beef
I be sort on fresh, I be lookin like a geek
Gucci so dark man I swear I can't see it
All this jewlery all this God damn money on me
I got robins on me, I'm a robin fiend
Robins everywhere, I got robin everything
300 team, what the fuck do you mean
I'm the block, I'm 300 bitch I'm gbe
We the hottest in the streets from the south side to north east

[Chorus]
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change
I be countin hunneds, count faces, getting paid
She gonn bust for me and she gonn do my team
True religion saggin, all them robin jeans
A lot of niggas changed, just because I'm getting change</pre>
