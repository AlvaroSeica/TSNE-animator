[Pharrell]
You can catch me ridin down on the fuckin Verrazano
Ass out just like Diallo Diablo
Hi Ho Silver call that motherfucker Tonto
Leave a smoke trail back in Jersey in my condo
You can run up like youre Ra-mbo
butchu better hit me nigga if you know what I know
'cause I got some +Supersize+ guys thatll hit you with a +combo+ - pronto
You wont see the +Mourning+ like Alonzo

[Lil Wayne]
Camo shorts, no socks with the red BAPE's
walk in to my closet, fuck around and get a headache
Fuck you so good, shawty you gon' need a bed break
Red Viper slither through the street like a red snake
Red diamonds in my chain, lookin like a red snake
Fuck-a wit me wrong man, you gon need some yellow tape
All dem awards, Wayne do you need a metal case?
("Yes!" "Yes!" "Yes!" "Yes!" "Yes!"
