Look out the way though
Look at all that bullshit goin on down there in the street
What's all that shit floatin out in the water?
I'm gonna get, we gotta get out of here
We gotta go somewhere
Grab your shopping cart, grab your cane
Let's get the heck out of here
We gotta move closer to the equator
When are they gonna start showin those Mr. T reruns?
I used to love that guy
Remember how he used to look?
Mr. T... wrestling?
Your Coca-Cola doesn't taste the same as it used to
Remember when a bowl of soup was a nickel?
All that bass is gonna break my ears</pre>
