Typed by: Old.red.101@gmail.com

U aint got a chopper, don't come to the ghetto
niggas got choppers with clips and curves in them
that'll knock your ass (?off/out?)

All the money in the world aint gonna save you black
play with me, your mammie's gonna have a heart attack
it's really real. It really is! I really will kill
Your little dick riding goons, they gon fall back
They'll be screaming DCF, before it's over jack
Yep, get 'em, get 'em nussie
I'm known to get the job done, complements of my gun
I don't believe bitch untill you kill something
so don't talk to me untill you kill something
I'll have you dressed in all black
in a church, front row, wondering did I do that
(?RIP?)(), fuck all you all
Kill the head, and the body's gonna fall
I'm a gangster mother fucker, I spank mother fucker, till I stank em motherf
My ears to the street and that's a known fact
suck my dick, put a hit on that (nussie)

U aint got a chopper, don't come to the ghetto
niggas got choppers with clips and curves in them
that'll knock your ass (?off/out?)

No gimmicks, no games when I aim
and when I blast, I be trying to kill your ass
with a chopper, you aint got to be straight
I'm bound to hit something, most likely your face
horizontal they twisting and turning
hot bullets to your spine, they burning (oh yeah)
chunks of meat all over the street
I call to get the job done, complements of my gun
choppers with clips and curves in 'em
Mister go and get 'em, I'm guaranteed to split 'em
get 'em, get 'em nussie
fuck 'em in their pussy
and I aint satisfied untill you're on the stretcher
I swear to god, oh, I'mma bet you, I'mma get you

U aint got a chopper, don't come to the ghetto
niggas got choppers with clips and curves in them
that'll knock your ass (?off/out?)</pre>
