[ Unique ]
I was chillin in the crib all alone by myself
Drinkin a glass of MoÃ«t with two blunts on the shelf
That's when the telephone rang, so I jumped up to answer it
It was my girl, she said, "Our date, we have to cancel it"
She had to take her little son up to the doctor
I was mad as hell, but then suddenly I had got the
Wildest idea, I thought, "I must be a jerk"
But then I took a second thought and said, "I know it'll work"
I called up my other girlie and she said, "I'm free"
I said, "The cribbie is empty, baby, so how about you and me?"
She said, "Unique I be right over cause I don't want you to be alone"
And she was knockin at the door before I hung up the phone
She came in, got some gin, went to the bathroom and changed
And I was thinkin of another plan that I could arrange
All of a sudden beep-beep-beep, my beeper would beep
Then when the number popped up, I said, "She's supposed to be asleep"
It was my playmate from Queens, I knew she'd be there soon
I said, "Damn it's about that time because it's a full moon"
But then my girl came down the stairs so I had to step away
Cause she was dressed up in a skimpy see-through neglige
I got undressed in a hurry and all was well
She said, "I'm ready for you to teach me about the AOL"
And for those of you who don't know what it stands for you're mistaken
Cause everybody knows about the Art Of Love-Making
I won't get into detail because I'll be here all day
Besides she only had a couple of hours that she could stay
She put ( ? ) on her hears, I knew she couldn't hear jack
That's when I heard a voice scream out, "Great Unique come back"
I said, "Just wait a minute, baby, how could I forget ya?"
She said, "Don't take too long cause I'ma come down the stairs to get you"
So I took the other girlie down into the basement
Somehow I knew that there would be another replacement
She gave the Great Unique a striptease act
I said, "I be with you in a second, just sit back and relax"
When I got halfway up the stairs the doorbell rang again
This time it was my true lover with about three friends
I ( ? ) my eyes almost popped out my head
A little voice kept tellin me, "Unique, you're dead"
( ? ) so be that as it may
And at the same time they all shouted, "Who the hell are they?"
But then they started lookin at all the liquor we had
And for a minute they didn't seem to be so mad
I said, "Hey, there is enough of me to go all around"
But then I turned those smiling faces back into a frown
But then they said, "What the hell, he's too fly to bust his bubble"
Then I took a look in the mirror and said, "Unique is double trouble"
