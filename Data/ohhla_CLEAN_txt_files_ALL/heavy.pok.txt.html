(*talking*)
Uh-uh, get this scrilla nigga already uh
Where ya at nigga, in this bitch baby
Mack Biggers in this bitch, with my nigga Po-Yo
Sensei, Bad Azz Mixtape nigga volume 3 nigga
Stanging like wasps baby, it go down for real
Respect it or check it baby, uh say

[Mack Biggers]
I'm a heavyweighter, and I'm tilting the scale
Known for pitching that yale, fuck with me you'll be sipping on shells
For my niggaz living in jail, I paint a picture vivid as hell
Like a flick in the mail
Now what y'all know about, only getting 16 hours of sleep
Out of a week, grinding cause the fam got's to eat
Same clothes on, fuck hoes long as your do's long
I'm trying to get rich dog, fuck trying to hold on
You sleeping niggaz, can catch two to the chest
With big killers, that'll shoot through your vest
Nosy bitches taking two to the neck, we putting work in then shoot to the West
It's Mack Biggers, it's the truth in the flesh
It's a grown man game, so learn to hold your own
Me and my dogs roll with the chrome, cooking up swolling stones
Learned the hard way, papa was a rolling stone
You know dog, when it's on it's on
You can get it while you can, or forget about it when it's over
I grind for mine dog, that's why I get it by the boulder

(*talking*)
Feel that my nigga, (yes sir, it's real)
(Real know real, it don't stop), started this different shit baby
(yes sir), let em know what ya tal'n bout Po-Yo
(for real already, crock bull bloodline)

[Big Pokey]
Waiting for the wagon, I'ma break it again
If rap broke the wagon, I'ma keep breaking my pen
And my skin is my sin, why I love my color
Don't hate us, cause we lace our whips up with dubs and butter
It's love in the gutter, niggaz thug in the gutter
Don't get drug in the gutter, cause you thought it was summer
Thought it was dead fell, found out it was jumping
I heard your partna turned swine, found out he was bumping
Got dropped, found out who was chunking
Got popped and your partna got rocked, found out we was dumping
Niggaz on they ass, cause they sit on they ass
They on they feet cause they stay on they feet, nigga get your cash
It got me knocking niggaz through the ropes, hand gun popping niggaz through the coat
2-23's, rocking niggaz through a boat
I play the game like a sport, and leave it all on the field
And when it's rap, leave it all on the real for real

(*talking*)
Naw I mean, whole 'nother level baby
(it's one hundred baby), appreciate that mayn
Biggers where ya at baby, (I'm right here baby)
Ready, cap off

[Mack Biggers]
Y'all know me, I'm known for acting ugly with a glock
Keeping my game low key, and chase money up the block

[Big Pokey]
My niggaz we stang like wasps, honey on the block
And we get money on the block, just like it fall off trees

[Mack Biggers]
Load up 18 wheelers, and haul off cheese
(we haul off keys), we got work so haul off these

[Big Pokey]
Say all y'all niggaz freeze, cause we robbing the bank
One hitters'll knock your dob in the paint

[Mack Biggers]
Woss Ness and Mobstyle, hit em hard with a shank

[Big Pokey]
Sensei and Mack Biggers, crack back niggaz

[Mack Biggers]
Like a car hit a tank

[Big Pokey]
I'm on the backstreets flipping, with the raw in the tank

[Mack Biggers]
Jug in the trunk, L.A. weed (snub and a pump)
Game face on, mugging a punk

[Big Pokey]
I got the same face on
Turn your back, and catch a slug in your rump

[Mack Biggers]
It's a scratch match my nigga, we love it or chump

[Big Pokey]
And bitch niggaz get hugged with this pump
(that's what it is)

(*talking*)
Get it how ya live, yeah straight up
Ride hard, heart of a hustler straight up
(don't stop till the casket drop baby), can't stop
Twist they asses, steady mashing gotta get it baby don't stop
Sensei, I still be thinking longevity
Gotta get it dog it don't stop, won't stop
Can't play with it yeah, (once again it's on nigga)
Mashing baby, everyday every city get it
A Bad Azz Mixtape Volume 3 (uh-huh)
Yeah, it's out there get it, Hurricane Sensei coming your way
Don't count my pockets mayn, Flood the gate
Veteran Rookie, dropping all that 2004
Enough for ery'body, we get that
Woss Ness they heavy, Presidential they heavy
S.U.C. we heavy, out here like potholes baby huh S.U.C.</pre>
