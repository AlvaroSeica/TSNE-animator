Song:   3 Foot Tall
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
When you're alone, life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're 3 foot tall
When its just you, well times can be tough
When theres no one there to catch your fall
(Ay ay ay ay)
3 foot tall
Like you're 3 foot tall
3 foot tall
When theres no one there to catch your fall
(Ay ay ay ay)

[Verse 1]
I am from the cross roads, off roads
Dodgin' all of the pot holes, in my auto-mobile hollerin' out watch out
We lost hope like Bob Hope, so what are we supposed to follow?
I'm a leader not an apostle, but I believe in the freedom that god holds
(Shit) I'm on the top rope, ready to jump so watch close
Been criticized and boxed out since I was a snot nosed kid
We ain't livin' for tomorrow we live for the lord though
Everybody tryin' to fit in the crowd like wheres Waldo?
I freeze time like photographs livin' for the moment
I'm taking mental pictures reminiscing while I'm smokin'
When I see the the light of day right away ill ride away
Cuz things I write and say give me direction like Michael Bay
I need somethin' in my life because my plans, they never work out
Like when I make plans to work out cuz everything
don't always turn out like you want them to, honest truth
Nahh ain't nothin' wrong with Luke go walk this path alone
but I need somebody here to talk me through, but who?

[Chorus]
When you're alone, life can be a little rough
It makes you feel like you're 3 foot tall
When its just you, well times can be tough
When theres no one there to catch your fall [x2]
3 foot tall
Like you're 3 foot tall
3 foot tall
When theres no one there to catch your fall

[Verse 2]
I know I have my unity, community,
but everyone that I did music with over the years disappeared,
when they're ain't too many still doin' this
Feeling like I've gone to war, lost my soldiers on the journey
Feeling like we built a team but ONLY I WEAR THE JERSEY yea
Everything comes and goes, I dealt with the undertow
Keeping my head above the water, pushed on, now I run the show
I know this situations never perfect deal with what you got
Never bite your tongue, tell your piece don't let them shut you up
They say everything about money, nah only business
If your friends think that, then you hang round money hungry bitches
The world is hollow y'all need to eat up I'm makin' a pot roast
These people are all over themselves and I ain't in to feeding no cockroach
Roller right, I know the type don't be a dick head
Cuz everything comes full circle jerk get it?
I ain't looking for the exit, I'm tryin' to show you where my head is
When you feel alone play my song and that keeps us connected
Check it
