um, operator, move the cross fader, come be my life saver
_with dark vador
study the art, study the art, under the arc
I spar haters
mark data, run up on you in the broad daylight
7:30, muddy numbers in my raider jersey
make money, take money
out of state money
africano, americano, shut the hell if I know
all I know is I looked away, he took off with my vinyl
no time to waste, threw on my cape
and _on my face
I'm in and out before security rewind the tape
area code fans, they scream the anthem, slap hands
shine my logo in the sky like batman
crash-land to brussels, I stay on my hustle
nah mean
do the job clean, get the top green
advanced psychology, auto biography
objective worldwide monopoly
__, throw me a magnum and a watch
as I attack with a force, its way too difficult\for any man to fathum
hold rappers for ransom, my record is an anthem
disappear into the night like I'm a panther
cut when necessarily, break down the force fields
to penetrate enemy lines and leave them buried
the g, the r, the a, the z murders_
the o, the m, the n, I deadly
knuckleheads paralyed
everyword analyzed
energy reenergized, streets are terrorized
rough dirty harry, bullet proof_sheild protectors
the warrior mentally I carry
prisoner to the melody, I forbid killers to vocal assassinators
using nothing but your memory
finish um with a cut, blow um' into smithereens
Rip um; into pieces, put an end to your dreams</pre>
