[Intro: Phonte]
Yea.. It's hard, but it's real, ya'kno m'sayin?
It's har- it's hard but it's real - hahaha! Hey

[Phonte]
Been thinking baby 
I finally took the time
The wound is healing now 
and now I realize

[Chorus: Shana Tucker] (Phonte)
Nothing you can say that could ever make me stay
Let me tell ya... (Ohh, ohh, yeah)
Nothing you can do, cause when it comes to me and you
She's just better (Bring it back - yeah, bring it back - yeah)
(Bring it back - yeah, bring it back)

[Chorus: Shana Tucker]
Nothing you can say that could ever make me stay
Let me tell ya... 
Nothing you can do, cause when it comes to me and you
She's just better 

[Eric Robinson]

And everyday I'm (everyday I'm)
Sure thankful for her (thankful for)
Such a feeling inside

[Chorus: Shana Tucker] (Phonte)
Nothing you can say that could ever make me stay
Let me tell ya... (Oooh yeah, ohh)
Nothing you can do, cause when it comes to me and you

[Phonte]
So I don't ever have to run away
And I don't ever wanna try to leave
A soft kiss on a summer day
It's the feeling that you giving me, yeah

[Eric Robinson]
She's always a friend of mine
And it came to me right on time
No tears left for me to cry
Cause it was you, not you and I

[Chorus: Shana Tucker] (Phonte) {Roberson}
Nothing you can say that could ever make me stay
Let me tell ya... (Yeaaaah-yeah, say yeeeeah-yeah, oh!)
Nothing you can do, cause when it comes to me and you
She's just better {C'mon, bring it back} (Yeah) {Bring it back} (Yeah)
{Bring it back} (Yeah) (Hol' up)

[Phonte]
If you know it, sing along with me
I used to feel like somethin was wrong with me
Big man, pimp hand strong with me
And maybe love really ain't belong with me
Slowed it down, took a vow of matrimony
Who woulda guessed it all ended in acrimony
Our eyes down, heads bowed like we in service
Cause you believe a man is to be your servant
Steady tellin yourself that he deserve it
Then wonder why a nigga broke out like he allergic
Psh! But I ain't talkin 'bout a hive
I'm talkin 'bout the lives of those who can reach us
Turn your world around and then teach us
Soup for the soul and it feeds us, so light a cand-le
I'm feelin brand new, fully loaded with features
A love that frees us, Jesus~!

[Outro: Shana Tucker]
She's just better</pre>
