Song:   When It Was Cold Outside
Typed by: @MidaZ

we met when it was cold outside
the summer couldnt show up
cause the sun ain't wanna show up
so the groundhog hides
there was lights in the trees still
and magic in the moment
through the deep chill
enough to make the impossible seem real

my hand was in my pockets
my shoulders slightly slumped
my flask was looking for a refill

seeing you was an accident this wednesday
you'll never meet a woman with your eyes low
my friends say
consult my sensai
he say
come out them timbs J
shave face
thats how you save face till games are in play
commute from work on the train
wondering if snowfall is planning to evolve from the rain
theres something to be said about
showing off the best you
you don't know if the bird inside you flies unless you let him out
so I adjusted my posture
put a smile on
and noticed you who should be added to my roster
i approached to lock you down like rasta
fari
my far eye could spot you'se proper
carrabbas
8 o'clock
you like pasta?
you joked on how I rolled up on you like a secret shopper
I'm joking back
that or we can polly with a whopper
off this talk alone I'm in a noose no posdu
love at first sight
I'm thanking Jesus for this christmas present
he presented
next years a wash
you can't top her


ours a true love story told beautifully
beyonce, jay, kim, kanye
they ain't you and me
cause you and me been you and me since 2pm that wednesday
when afterwards you only ordered salad at carrabbas
we spoke of future conquests
i told you next to you I see no contest
one day we'll have a house like ali babas
2.5 kids
white picket fence

ladies and gents I present
the culmination of time well spent
i see it like its written in print
without the missing intent
shall we begin
you smiled
said slow down
thats a lot of future planning and I'm not even sure its the way its
supposed to go down
i reply follow your heart,
see what your hearts saying
she said I listen to my heart and hear a harp playing
I said me too
its like when reggie miller start jaying
or when your family prays and all of them at once amen
enslavements your accepting of the cards dealt
enjoying being beaten by a large belt
from the moment I knew and asked for Gods help
He introduced me to you
I don't think its coincidence
He's prolly in heaven sayin don't mention it
but please don't mess it up
separate or injure it
and that's only an ode to times we're living in
cause there's nobody else id rather have my happy ending with</pre>
