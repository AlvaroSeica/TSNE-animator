[Chorus: Roger Peterson]
The sword in life, glory and faded
People confused, buried and hated
Our god was told, you will find him
Late in the board, only to fight it

[Cilvaringz]
You see like Spliff be to Busta, Jungle be to Nas
Beretta be to RZA, I'm to God
I go nutty for his word to be told, to uphold
His value above, God's feelings in gold
Despite of what you got, done fucked the soul
Your soul will be judged at the end of your road
So, since I was a child at a concious age
I, spoke his name in vain when enraged, trying to
Gain knowledge, and laid to prophets
But it was fake and displayed designers
So I conceited to Allah to fight Satan
Teach pagans, and diversify Arabians
In the eyes of those victims to the media
Given an image of a threat, made it easier
For them to slay us in the eyes of the weak
And justify the war, with the lies they speak, come on

[Chorus]

[Cilvaringz]
So help us sincerely, our mothers, our fathers
Strengthen our sisters, our cousins, our brothers
Paradise for martyrs, I pray for the truth
And for immunity, for our community
Cuz Bush is out to rule me and fool me
Offer me his freedom, so he can go free and rob my rubies
Surrounds me with groupies, and jubilees
But they will never read, they only read in movies
I write the eulogy for death, has erased us
And left us faceless, and death carried faithless
They'd rather live, fearing death, well embrace us
And die fighting, the rest of these pagans

[Hook: Roger Peterson]
When we rise up, our sword in our clutch, and fighting injustice
And never seak the pleasures that come far
Death to souls of our brothers

[Chorus]

[Cilvaringz]
See my circumference consist of the righteous and God abundance
Qu'ran readers and devoted Muslims
Who pray five times a day, announce the faith
And denounce what the Nation says on fridays
That's why son, I never preach in lessons
Pay homage to your words in my least of efforts
And for Allah, I seak repentance
That's for myself and 85 percenters
Cuz yo, his name is but entitled to these so called wisemen
Who try to come across civilized then
Supreme to the so called 85's, when
When will you realize man is man
Not Allah, stop saying that the black man is God
For sir, you have traded far, quote the Qu'ran
Awaiting assassination, thought I'm not, we must kill
Saying the same shit

[Chorus]</pre>
