[Chorus]
If you fall up in the club
And them niggaz wanna mug
When you step up to they face
What they gon' do (Shit!!!)

If you fall up in the club
And them hoes start acting up
When you step up to them hoes
What they gon' do (Shit!!!)

What they gon' do (Shit!!!) 8X

[Verse one: Lil Jon &amp; The Eastside Boyz]
Pussy nigga what's up
Hell naw you ani't gon' buck
All that poppin' at the mouth
Gon' get you fucked up (2X)

You done came in the club
With your muthafuckin' click
We don't give a fuck hoe
Ya'll pussy like bitches (2X)

It's some Eastside niggaz and they deep in this bitch
And they step to any nigga that be talkin' that shit
It's some Westside niggaz and the deep in this bitch
And they step to any nigga that be talkin' that shit
It's some Northtside niggaz and the deep in this bitch
And they step to any nigga that be talkin' that shit
It's some Southtside niggaz and the deep in this bitch
And they step to any nigga that be talkin' that shit

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Lil Scrappy]
My brain is taking in too much pain
I'm bout to explode first, and then take names
But it's cool lil' shorty don't be so alarmed
I learned to buck nigga when I jabbed in the arm
I don't play wit muthafuckas 'cause the shit be real
Make you hold your breath longer than the Navy Seal
And them bows gon' leave you ass dead in the past
Ain't no way you can differ your dick from your ass

I drop bows wit my nigga fuck hoes wit my nigga
How the fuck you think I feel about this arm in your figure
It's a closed casket for them hating bastards
It's some G's that's real, it's a mess of faggots
Who you talkin' to bitch, what you gon' do trick
When it's obvious to see that you ain' t do shit
Lil Scrappy the prince and I ain't takin' no junk
I'm a quiet crunk nigga and fuck being a punk

[Chorus]

[Hook: Lil Jon &amp; The Eastside Boyz]
I'm walkin' round this mutha fuckin' club
(What!!!)
Them niggaz still lookin over here and shit
(Lookin over here talkin and shit!!!)
Think we gon' have to get some muthafuckin' stragihtening going on this muthafucka (Yeah!!!)
This what we gon muthafuckin' do
(What's up!!!)
We gon walk over to these muthafuckin' niggaz
(Yeah!!!)
Talk to their ass like this..... (Like this)

Only bitches talk shit
Only bitches talk shit
Only bitches talk shit
That's why we bustin' your shit (2X)

[Chorus]
