Aye

[Chorus - T.I.]
My section in the club (club), Rémy, Rosé ('sé)
On your mark ready, set, go, okay (okay!)
Everytime I pop that bottle, make that thing go - pop
Everybody pop a bottle, make that thing go - pop
See him standin on the furniture, doin his thing
Tell the club owner, fuck yo couch, Rick James (bitch nigga)
Everytime I pop a bottle, make that thing go - pop
Let her drink it 'til she drown, now the girl gone wild
Pop a bottle - pop, pop, pop
(Just pop that bottle) - pop, pop, pop, pop
(Hey pop that bottle, that bottle) - pop, pop, p-pop, pop, pop
(Hey, hey, that bottle go) - pop, p-pop, pop
(Everybody make that bottle go) - pop

[Verse 1 - T.I.]
Bring me 1738, champagne of all sorts
Ya gettin money, make it rain, buy a bottle, pop a cork
(Oop, oop), dork, if I may retort
I ball just as hard tomorrow as the day before
I pop bottles but I don't pour, save a glass for you guys
We ballin on a budget, fuck it, let your glasses rise
Im straight to the head with mine, why you actin surprised?
Ask any ho who know me, all I do is smash and ride
Buckets of bubbly, shake it up and let it splash in her eyes
Ain't no subtraction, only cash to divide
We gettin money, bank roll, super-sized, whether rain, sleet, sunny
Let the good times roll and the bottles keep comin

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Drake]
Yeah, okay, bring that shit to poppa
I heard you talk 'bout other niggaz, them niggaz no matter
The tag team back bitch, boom shakalaka
Me and Weezy run this shit, so bring me one soda and vodka
And a Fiji for my nigga, 'cause the police probably watchin
Man, probation is a bitch but goin back is not an option
We be sunnin/sonnin all these niggaz, put they ass up for adoption
Man, we start with straight shots, then get to bottle poppin
We be workin all night, telethon shit
Roll a super skinny one, Chanel Iman shit
Ooh, thats that fire, thats that have you calm shit
You with a lot of dudes, thats that Elton John shit, ahh
To each his own, I like a freak that's grown
I like a bad bitch, from a decent home
Me and T.I.P., this that pimpin that we preachin on
And everybody tryin to listen nigga, speakerphone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
I know them suckers wish the judge would of threw the book at me
'Cause I show up to the club, super cool, look at me
Everything brand new, you get money like who?
Spent 150 on my car and my Audemars too
When I walk up in the spot, ain't nobody saw you
They see me like there he go, look at you like ahh, who?
Bought every bottle at the bar, shorty you know how I do
I take 'em all across your noggin, I ain't fittin to argue
Still +Big Shit Poppin'+, nothin changed but my clothes
Triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll
Tell the bitch, I take ya places where your man cant go
Cant be, he ain't doin shit, if he ain't me, can't you see
The difference between us when I walk in to the door?
With twenty thousand worth of ones, start lettin that money go
Let it fly, throw some twenties when my ones runnin low
Fifty stack, Im a show ya how to ball, triple that (bap, bap, bap)
