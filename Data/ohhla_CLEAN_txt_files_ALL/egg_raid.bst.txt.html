{*24 seconds of instrumental to open*}

[Chorus: Beastie Boys]
Egg raid on Mojo
Egg raid on Mojo
Egg raid on Mojo
Egg raid on Mojo

[Verse One]
We dressed, all in black
We snuck up a-round the back
We began, to attack
The eggs did crack on Mojo's back
Go!!!

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Gonna scream, gonna fight
We'll have an egg raid tonight
Gonna scream, gonna fight
We'll have an egg raid tonight!!!!!

[Outro]
Egg raid, gonna die
Beat up Mojo, all the time</pre>
