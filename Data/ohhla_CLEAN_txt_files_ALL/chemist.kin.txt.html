[Intro]

Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present to you
A collaboration of epic proportions
It's Kinetik, Kuroisoul, Hip Hop Is Forever
Bass &amp; Format

[Verse 1]

See I'm a product of the struggle reminiscent of a different time
Forget the glamour and glitz, this is the grit and grime
Prose and flows are like picture and sign
A true novelist addiction, this was written with big in mind
From boy to man, from feather to quill
In me the heart of a writer is forever instilled
And with a bleeding heart, I decorate the canvas
Believe it's art that's why they venerate the stanzas
None equal my tongue is regal
But still I sing with the slaves cause I'm one among the people
So as I examine the human condition
I'm under the tree of knowledge and I'm feasting on the fruit of wisdom
I'm a purveyor of the pen 
And when the lines are designed, you'll be rating them a ten
It's from the heart even when I say it with offence
Kinetik and you spell it with a "k" at the end

[Chorus]

We're coming live and direct from across the miles
The newest tag team coming with a proper style
You might've heard it like this, but not in a while
Kuroisoul and Kinetik, we're chemistry perfected
We're coming live and direct from across the miles
The newest tag team coming with a proper style
You might've heard it like this, but not in a while
Kuroisoul and Kinetik, we're chemistry perfected

[Verse 2]

He's like the offspring of Preem and a descendant of Pete
Somewhere in California just perfecting a beat
Making sure the music is rooted and kept in the street
And with just a kick and a snare, you'll be listening clear
Right on the spot just watch for the slice and a chop
Igniting the block but never try and slight him for props
Cause the beats are retarded but not for the weak hearted
And as soon as he sparks it, you'll be nodding your head
And some'll do their best but he's the meaning of super fresh
A sick mix of Dilla, RZA and Nujabes
And yes, he'll be sat at the feet of legends
Deep in their presence, releasing a sound that'll reach heaven
So as he keeps pressing and teaching lessons
On how to inveigle an ear in need of refreshing
That's when your head and neck will start to respond
Kuroisoul, no words, still his heart is in the song

[Chorus]</pre>
