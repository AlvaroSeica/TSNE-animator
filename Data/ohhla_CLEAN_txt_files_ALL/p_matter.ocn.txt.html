[Frank Ocean]
And the peaches and the mangos that you could sell for me
What do you think my brain is made for?
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter

Sensei replied - what is your woman?
Is she, just a container for the child?
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu

Oooh ooh ooh
Close my eyes and, fall into you you you
My God
She's giving me pleasure... forever

What if the sky and the stars are for show?
And the, aliens are watching live
From the purple matter

Sensei went quiet, then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu

Oooh ooh ooh ooh
Dim the lights and, fall into ah-you you youuuuu
My God, you're giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure!!!
Pleasure over matter

[Andre 3000]
Since you been gone I been havin withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself naw
She's better with some fella with a regular job
I didn't want to get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sittin in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memories no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock stop, what am I Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-Southern, not me cousin
If models are made for modelin
Thick girls are made for cuddlin
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend, I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

Grey matter...
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

You're good at bein bad, you're bad at bein good
For heaven's sakes go to hell; nah, knock on wood
You're good at bein bad, you're bad at bein good
For heaven's sakes go to hell - for heaven sakes go to hell
Knock knock knock knock on wood
Well Frankly when that Ocean so muh'fuckin good
Make her swab the muh'fuckin wood
Make her walk the muh'fuckin plank
Make her rob a muh'fuckin bank
with no mask on and a rusty revolver</pre>
