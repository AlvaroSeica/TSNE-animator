[Mr. Shadow]
Quivole 
Mr. Shadow, Lil' Rob
Viscious Man Funk on the boards 
Coming at you for the 98 
And it won't stop
Check It

[Mr. Shadow]
It is I the unfadable lyricist
Bringin mad hits for that ass
One way in the past
When I mash
Let me hear you scream and hollar when ya see me
Party people in the house can ya feel me
It's Mr. Shadow and I'm known to explode
Like a box of C-4 when I bust at a show
I have shown that I'm down to breaking it down like a boulder
If ya wanna bring the drama put the rifle to my shoulder
But I ain't trippin cause I'm here to make ya bounce
Counting money by the stacks, bustin raps and buildin clout
Now all my dogs packin clips and the gats
Ready for the confratation never hesitate to cap
Now you know it ain't nothin but a gangsta party
Drinkin Don Pereon Dry Gin and Barcardi
In California the home of real pimp and players with the raw dough
Down to the bone on the streets or on the microphones
Gettin bent is a daily thing, home boys get down girls yell my name
I be the Shadow that will follow you regaurdless through the night
Causin fright when you step into the light

[Chorus 2x]
Mr. Shadow, Lil Rob, and The Viscious Man Funk
Coming through with the funk that you bump in your trunk
Go ahead, go ahead make ya body move
Go ahead and make ya body move

[Lil' Rob]
I grab my Levis and my ironin board
Cuffs all messed up cause the back drags on the floor
But that's all good, got no one to impress
My fame will over come those that are best dressed
Must confess, got to get this of my chest I must have been blessed
Can see that I been convince ready to go so lets go
I jumped in the ride headed for my destination
Tonight is going to be sick, but I don't need no medication
Going lady chasing, but never mind, cuz they ain't runnin
Cuz we all came to the party for a little some thing some thing
Oh girls you lookin so nice
I could see that one right there with some one like me
Should I take the chance and ask one to dance
Do I want the one in the mini skirt or the tight pants
It doesn't matter cause they're beautiful
I can't help to lose my cool
I can't help but drool when they push and pull

[Chorus 2x]

[Mr. Shadow]
You can push you can pull you can do what you want
Mr. Shadow, Lil' Rob and The Viscious Man Funk
Nothin bunk but the stuff we blaze in the place
You can't drink for free (so you best bring a case)
That's on the realer when I feel the efection
I'm getting loaded and I notice the closes to me
I keep it cool cause shes noticing me
And that's the only type of girl I see puposin to me
So I lean to the side and wink with my eye to let her know
Baby got it going on so I can't let her go
Lil' Rob where'd you go I was lookin for your ass

[Lil' Rob]
I was downing drinks like water so I got drunk kinda fast
I was on the other side just doing what I do
Looking for a girl to talk to, not you
I got my eyes on one, I want you to have my son
And we can get this done if you want to have some fun
But if, you don't want to, it's ok, I'll just go find another one

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
