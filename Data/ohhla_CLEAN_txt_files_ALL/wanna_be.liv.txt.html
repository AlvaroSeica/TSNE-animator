[Slick Rick sample](repeat 2X)
Kill a muthafucker then I him who the fuck I am

[Stretch in background]
Yeah, I'm gonna show these niggas, you know what I'm sayin'?
Mad niggas don't give a fuck what you know about

[Chorus: Stretch](Slick Rick sample)(repeat 4X)
Wanna Be, Gonna Be,
Nggas better scram cuz I
(Kill a muthafucker then I tell him who the fuck I am)

Check this shit out here

[Stretch]
Wanna be, gonna be
Niggas faking moves
Drop jewels, chest plates
Nigga, if you know the rules
I kick phat black beats, where my mind is at
Move the fuck back or YGz on the kill attack
Turn the page, blood stains
He's my man, at least I thought he was
Stick and flip shit like a nigga does
Listen, money clockin', running the spots and,
running up in motherfucking jewellery stores with glocks and
Niggas keep ripping shit up with the quickness
Adrenaline running through my veins cuz I'm with this
Coming off, grab the moneybags and the whole shit
busting at the 50's cuz I ain't doing no bit
Quick, fast
Niggaz haul ass to the hide out, my nine's out
??? the dime route
The coast is clear, yeah,
We in like Flynn
Now it's time for the splittin' to begin
Do the knowledge
Now one day we're dividing up cash,
I clear my head for a second
and peep this nigga dipping in the stash,
Let me tell you something
I the one that schooled this kid
He just became a thoroughbred from the shit we did
I go everything straight down the middle
That ain't no riddle
What's hard to understand?
Put my cash in my hand, nigga
He started reaching as if he was the flipmode
So on his face, boom
I emptied out a clip load
what made you think you could out game the gamer?
Especially when I'm the one who trained yer, nigga

[Chorus: Stretch](Slick Rick sample)(repeat 4X)
Wanna Be, Gonna Be,
Nggas better scram cuz I
(Kill a muthafucker then I tell him who the fuck I am)</pre>
