[Intro: Azeem]
Yeah..
Oakland, California
Nineteen Two Thousand and Seventy Seven
Yeah, A-Z-33-M, Germany, what's happenin? 
Told y'all a long time man, E.T.C. - Erase and Take Charge 
Time never was, yeah...

[Azeem] 
Told you last record our minds was museums 
When you bare witness, no need to believe it 
I wrote these vocals while dreamin 
Ridin on lions with wings Watchin hell bein freezing (Uh) 
You can go call all your popular demons 
and wizards and witches and lizards and preachers 
They build more prisons than places for teachers
Prostitute freedom, gave us fake leaders 
Broke out the paint, and made a fake Jesus 
Broke off the noses to make a fake Egypt 
Greek like Adonis, Nike and Adidas 
Talisons made from Osiris's penis 
Legacy stolen, statues of Venus 
Asses the sizes of Rome Colosseum
Juggernauts, Cyclops, and Titans eat HÃ¤agen-Dazs 
Waiting in Babylon, return of The Astronauts

[Chorus: cuts and scratches by DJ Zeph]
"Get the people's hands up above" 
"Get-Get, Get, Get respect and love worldwide"
