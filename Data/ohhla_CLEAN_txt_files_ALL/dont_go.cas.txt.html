Song:   Don't Go Too Slow
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't, don't go too slow
I like it when you go real hard
Don't go too slow

Hoo whoa
I've waited for this since I saw you
Now it's finally that time
To explore the way I really feel about you
You got me weak in my knees, hoo whoa
Even like I can't believe, ha ah
So if you want it come get it from me don't waste my time
Listen when my body talks

Ooh boy I'm waitin' for you to put your lovin' on me
So hurry while the night's still young
And I promise that you will be satisfied (satisfied)

Don't, don't go too slow
I like it when you go real hard
Don't go too slow
Don't, don't go too slow
I like it when you go real hard
Don't go too slow

Hoo whoa
Can't you give me somethin' better
Somethin' that I ain't seen yet
Somethin' that can take my breath a, take my breath a, take my breath away, hoo whoa
What can keep me goin' babe, ha ah
Cuz if you can't I know somebody who can do it my way (my way)
Who can listen to what my body says

Ooh boy I'm waitin' for you to put your lovin' on me
On me so hurry while the night is still young
And I promise that you will be satisfied (promise you'll be satisfied)

(So don't)
Don't, don't go too slow
I like it when you go real hard
Don't go too slow
Don't, don't go too slow
I like it when you go real hard
Don't go too slow

I'm warning you
Don't go so slow
I'm warning you
I'm warning you
Don't go so slow
I'm warning you

Don't, don't go too slow
I like it when you go real hard
Don't go too slow
Don't, don't go too slow
I like it when you go real hard
Don't go too slow

I'm warning you
Don't go so slow
I'm warning you
I'm warning you
Don't go so slow
I'm warning you</pre>
