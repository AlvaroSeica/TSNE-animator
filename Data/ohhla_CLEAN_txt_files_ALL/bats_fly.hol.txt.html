[Intro: Holocaust]
Hatchet in his head, We'll roll him up in a carpet
Carry him up the staircase, Wu-Tang, Black Knights
Holocaust, Skeleton Low, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
West Coast, The fliest shit ever, Yo, Yo
Smash a roach in a pipe and smoke it

[Holocaust]
A blood stained diary, Snakes in the bath tub
Run through the meadow laughing with revolvers
Mean man Skeleton Low, Insane
Will scream in pain, Sometimes it does rain
Cannon ball trees, Uzis and flamingos
Dead men mumble, Grab me when I stumble
Swig on whisky, Actress tried to kiss me
Blew it from across the room, But it missed me
Now at the Bombay chat house with pistols
Might tip my hat, Whistling in the graveyard
Shells on the street, Holocaust is cold
Now known as Skeleton Low, Devils fold
Blue socks fancy red shoe
When it rains the flowers drip candy
Couldn't understand me, Pistol on the dresser
Never was lesser, Lay you on the stretcher
Slit his wrist with the piece of a broken record
Music from the Sun, Lonely hitch-hiker
In the darkest corners of the city
In the darkest corner

[Chorus: Holocaust]
The planet gets priced for what it gives us
A beggar taxed for a corner to die in
The crooked priest has his fee
Who doesn't live trust and
We bargin for the graves that we lie in
While at the Devil's booth all things are sold
Each ounce of junks costs it's ounce in gold
Knowledge to the poorest comer free and lavish this summer
Makes myself quit shucking and jive'n

[Holocaust]
The light in the distance, Spider crawling on marble
Lay in an empty pool with a pistol
Wu-Tang Official, whistle like a missile
White House with black walls, Come correct
Music in Iraq, Kiss you in the darkness
Whisper to the daylight, Circus at the gravesite
Fe-Fo-Fum, where is Francesca, A shovel fell over
Sitting, Smoking yeska, Bloody fiesta
Man without a name though
One zombie went out over to touch the rainbow
Gun in my coat, The bar just closed
A white owl biting a rose sat froze
Winding back roads, Swerve in a garbage truck
Of all things I've lost, I miss my mind the most
Big West Coast, Heavy smoke
A well dressed skeleton slowly cuts your throat
Emcees find themselves falling down
Lost in the sound, Drink until you drown
The funny old man and his wife stay on the mountain
We guzzle wine, La-La-La-La

[Chorus]

[Holocaust]
A hand in the darkness, Bats fly in the rain
We play where the dead man hang, A spiked brain
Coffee on the table, Skeletons in the walls
Wander down the cobwebbed halls until you fall
Deep in a coffin, Look at the wooden crates
My pistol changes shapes, Bullet holes in your drapes
Soap in the dirt, Plates in the lake
The clown with the tare away face is selling cake
Roaches in a shoebox, Mice in the guitar
Just through the woods and over, It isn't far
Drink up the bar, Pour bullets into a shot glass
Stomp through the attic, Blood smeared on the window
A purple rose from Cairo
A match fell down the tunnel in slow motion
Walk at the bottom of the ocean, With a notion
A man selling pictures, Lonely on the road
Mean mad Skeleton Low, From the cold
When he walked through the crowd, Their heads explode
Stand in the doorway, Came from California
Head dressed short a few feathers, Face the music

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
