Lay ya hammer (lay ya hammer)
Lay ya hammer kid (lay ya hammer kid)
They want the drama bring it to em Fuck em

Ghostface:

All rise meet the preacher this pro dueler been diagnosed 
Diabetic keptic Im your host
Lock the vanilla suede British
Staten Island mall menace
Otherwise posin as a dentist in my lenses
Pinball machine gun rap spoke to Arafat
Laundry maid honey cant blow in this hat 
What

Method Man:

Is it raw now
Change it around
Its war now
The final countdown commences
The battleground is twelve inches of wax paper
Breakin down your defenseless senseless nature
Pain stings with Ma Baker
Twin towerin I skyscrape ya
Freedom come meet your maker

Inspektah Deck:

Yo 
Another sound boys dyin
Crowd noise multiplyin
Dont let the fuzz slide in bust out the sirens
Sure win lure em in like exotic women 
I smile with the sinister grin and finish him
Youre fuckin with hoods, get ya goods pushed back
Ya fraud, pull the wool off your hollywood hat


U-God:

Yo Yo Yo
The track melts in half liquors have this brave meaning
Supreme being being all that I can being
Picture wavy beavers meat cleaving your receiver
Fly sunny cheeba leather buckets dirty reefer
Fast floatin grill residential honey hill
Stainless steel rashes sheisty catch a money bill


Raekwon:

Its all gravy 
We floatin through like the British navy 
Fresh design lady  love the fade keep it wavy
The mix drink - throw the dick in the drink
Play it baby girl caught ya
Exotic album Cuban Link
Custom AVs beige panties who could front on these please
Yall niggas broke so much your uncle sells trees

Gza:

Yo 
High ranked officials and armed tanks and missles
Blood drizzle simple fact you slept on the issue
That before he started jerkin off joysticks and Sega
I made tapes a hundred watt amps insuring Vegas
Rza fine tune it shippin meal units
MCs ask, who be those rhyme killers in masks?
No doubt difficult task to last in the square
Beware infinte amount of darts is in the air
Im victorious no opponents and blast through components
And microphones watch the whole world live the moment
Anything anti that came approachin this
Incapable lust speech remains motionless

Lay ya hammer (Lay ya hammer)
Lay ya hammer kid (Lay ya hammer kid)
Lay ya hammer (Lay ya hammer)</pre>
