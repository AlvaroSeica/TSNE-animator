[Sample: The Untouchable's "Mr. Postman"]
Wait, oh yes, wait a minute Mr. Postman
Wait, wait Mr. Postman
I think Mr. Postman looked at me
Woah yeah, you got a letter in your bag for me
Please please Mr. Postman
Oh yeah

[Scooby Doo
 sample]
Shaggy : Like what do we do now?
Fred   : Well, there's no doubt in my mind that that hermit's the Creeper
Daphne : Let's get back to the Mystery Machine and go for the Sheriff
Shaggy : Boy am I glad we've see the last of that creeper
Scooby : Me too
Velma  : The Creeper!
Shaggy : Zoiks! It's him!

[Intro: Warcloud]
Warcloud, Unique, yeah
Beat City, verbal warriors
Observe, call the corridor warriors
Yo yo

[Warcloud]
Unmarked graves, bone havens, jaw breaker tycoon
Choke sleeper Porsche from the land fields, my jam kills
Rusty iron giant who razzmatazz the world
Smash a champ soda, took his bike, left him his girl
Candy her phalanges, we smuggle booze in the graveyard
Lush vine of roses, I pop shots ferocious
And rewire your faulty brain circuitry as a courtesy
If you cop the drop, emergency home surgery
From the mandibles of a mechanical cannibal
A titanical, grammatical mosaic dismantled you
And snapped three million bare skeletons, creatures rotting
In the museum I put bodies upon bodies
Ultimate heavy cannon, seven ships and seven hats
Victorious stoned by raved Arian, followed by eleven bats
Off to my moon base, one of the moons of Pluto
Then back to blast the city, Sneaky Pete and Black Bart
Six finger gem wine opener, the train
Through the desert on the 'Horse With No Name' and heavy fame
Green hunting hawk, hunting swan, atomic pesticides
I burst through your Great Wall of China , you demolecularise
Grail jail crushing creepers
A bribe in the hand betrayals mystic Van Hart
They who enter at the backstairs, expect to get shown out out the window
Yo yo yo, expect to get shown out out the window

[Chorus x2: Warcloud]
Walnut jelly pool shark, welcome to the lighthouse
Pistol in a bread box, one flew over cuckoo
Zombies cooped up in a cottage smoking cigars
Pipe bomb at the Olympics, Stone Roses

[Juleunique]
We be the undercover specimen, phenomenal mind explosive
Bomb your landmark with a charge of nitroglycerin convulsive
Resource for resources, those who contradict I speak against
We attack with forces, the thunderous thunderstorm
Me and my swarm we way above the norm'
I snatch your mics so hard that it dislocate your arm
Y'all niggas ain't knowing about the 360 divine
Tragedy, the last paragraph, get to the bottom line
Cats' minds that I build with, they be the solid kind
'Cause they spark in my projects they be the same kind
Who dare come amongst us and lend more jewels for battling
My nitroglycerin charge leave your database shattering
Regurgitate rhymes, speed on your head, brain battering
Fantastic rap mic fabulous
Cipher niggas grab microphones, spit hazardous
Resurrect the mental dead like Lazarus
Catch me up north chilling up in Club Cannabis
Me and Warcloud knock your dome rocky like the Grand Canyon is
Cipher niggas flip the format in your manuscript
You can't handle it, get smashed like a sandwich is

[Break: Warcloud]
We flat house floozies, floozies
The Jakes stay in the door house yo
Yo yo yo yo yo

[Chorus x2]

[Warcloud]
I'm like a '57 Chevy Christine, so pristine
On the candy apple sweet cream sixteen peep
My raps are the front runners of land creatures like the cola can
Heavy heavy hollow spine fish, the line was crisp
Deadly game show and behind tomb number three
Is the imperial eating eyeball serial
'Letters From a Killer', I gulp your brains down with Miller
Dark side tiller, I stab you in the chest with a pillar
That collapse the Greek monument, Great Chiefs conglomerate
Shadow circle the hall with swords, bloody astonishment
Faces slide across walls, off y'all so grand
We sent two groups, one the foot and one the hand
Wu-Tang Clan, barbarians and iron samurais
Whisper battle cries that shatter skies and planets die
World eaters and y'all termites in the canister
Code of soldier janitor, horror flicks over the banister
Alleyway butcher, eight spirits that nurture
This rap's the dead body of a sewer maintenance worker

[Chorus x2]</pre>
