It was one of them days when
The sky was perfect
Beyond my vocab
It's hard to word it
If this was like my very last day on every then
These 24 hours in LA would be worth it
A couple of bills paid
A couple of bills not
For now its bout new kicks
And new gear copped
I'm not in the 6 drop
I love what I got though
Forget the AC, roll down the window
Let's feel the nice breeze
Turn the beats up
We on the freeway
Hittin the beach up
I'm kissin my babygirl
Cuz I know one thing
Long as she smile
Then I can't complain
As long as I got you
I got everything
My daughter's my sunshine
All day everyday
Forgettin what I lack
Lovin what God gives
Enjoyin my time here
Replying with no fear
I'm ready to Live

Chorus
I'm ready to live; I'm ready to see
I'm ready for all that's in store for me
I'm ready to fly; I'm ready to fall
Whatever it is, I'ma take it all
Whatever it be, is fine for me
I'm planting a seed so I can climb a tree
And when the leaves, begin to fall, and end it all
I'ma move on because I'm ready to live

2nd Verse

Life is hard man
Nah Life is easy
Nah Life is exactly what you make it believe me
Bless you Cam J
I wish you see me
Becoming the very star we thought that we'd be
When we was watching Ed Lover on MTV
We had big dreams man the Baggy Jeans Clan
Practiced dance moves
Practiced interviews
It's like it was yesterday
When we was just little dudes
But now that I'm grown man
You've been long gone and
I keep your name in my rhyme so you live on and
Everybody's somebody to somebody so
Carry yourself well cuz really you never know
Addicted to good times, but thankful for bad ones
Because I really never knew good til I had none
And at long lasting
I'm getting the cash in
Cuz getting's a habit
The same to give ya'll I'm ready to live

Break
Life ain't about what list that you can fall on
Life is about who's name that you can call on
Once you had everything and now it's all gone
You gotta march on, we not alone
Life aint about what list that you can fall on
Life is about who's name that you can call on
You a pace for change you can't wallow
We gotta march on, we not alone

Chorus
I'm ready to live; I'm ready to see
I'm ready for all that's in store for me
I'm ready to fly; I'm ready to fall
Whatever it is, I'ma take it all
Whatever it be, is fine for me
I'm planting a seed so I can climb a tree
And when the leaves, begin to fall, and end it all
I'ma move on because I'm ready to live</pre>
