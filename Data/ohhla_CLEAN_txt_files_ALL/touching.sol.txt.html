[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, What the fuck is good huh, Killa Mob
I hear niggas talk so much fuckin shit man
Mitch what's good nigga, Yeah, Haha, That's right
Fuckin stagnated ass niggas man, Like this

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
Is you touching that paper, Is you touching that paper
Is you touching that paper, Is you touching that paper

[Solomon Childs]
Layin back, Blowin that Hawaii haze
Jackpot, Time to break open the bank
I'm exactly what you think I aint
I'll get to gun butt'n niggas in they pucker ups
I swear to God that's fake beef and it's nothin but a cover up
For the side money these niggas make
That hush up informant money these bird niggas take
And got the audacity to get pissy in they pants
You shake'n like a stripper nigga, Tightin up
I'm so disappointed in you this evening my nigga
You ever met somebody who been hustle'n one way for a while
And you aint see too much pop off, And aint to much come forth
But shit, I aint been in it that long
And now-a-days I'm engaged in did ya heard
I bought my Grandaddy a Phantom, Sent it to him in Honduras
And Divine financed a duplex for my Momma in the Hampton's
In the clubs of Decatur get spins with Flex
Cause I spit that chemical X
And they got by the C.S.I.N.Y., Hold em for ransom
Paparazzi take'n pictures of the black Gotti
Look Momma I'm handsome.

[Chorus]

[Desert Eagle]
I'm every two bit of big to be hold down weight
Make'n the ground shake
Homey you soft somethin similar to a pound cake
I been while'n since they left me up and down state
I been while'n been reppin for Staten Ilse's sake
A big homey, Trip a little G, Sound great
I got my stones with me and we hold down gates
I got E.S.G., Here to take the state
All Goonied up, Gettin all kind of cake
I'll split ya wig, Boy ya did yall did
Don't make me call them stick up kids
Ohh, You a baller, Give me that shit
You don't want my Y.G.'s tip toe'n through the crib
A train, Gang bang on your wiz
We do the layin in the straight to the bridge, Bitch

[Chorus]</pre>
