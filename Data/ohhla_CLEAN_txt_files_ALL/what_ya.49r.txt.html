Well it's the rhymer with the drama for you and yours
I make niggas touch the ceiling, make bitches get the drawers
Then hit the doors, but don't let them hit you where the lord split you
My style is too developed and you always get the picture
Hit you with weapons and let the undertaker take you
Shake you, bake you, now it's time to meet your maker
You only illustrate the fact that you can't hold me
For real, what's the deal on that weak tape you sold me

Jas Mace

Rappers are below me your crew couldn't hold me in a microphone dispute
You bet I'll take the lute when I shoot
These lyrical injections it's got you practicing
And where I'm from they don't allow it but I'm still taxin'
Now I'm asking, who got you block on lock
It's The Outfit never hesitant to blow the spot
You got a lot of clothes but I hear no skills on the mic
I take flight like Pan AM and drop bombs like Japan

Marchitect

Kaboom give me room so I can drop this dynamite
I take flight into the night with tight rhymes to recite
I make a beat in a minute and now you're finished
Diminished I pop eyes without the aid of spinach
And punk emcees for their checks girls who front on the sex
Feel little like Malcolm when they become my ex
I rock beats that make you want to get off the wall
Spring on stage seasons change and emcees fall

Jas Mace

Now all y'all better realize Jas Mace don't disguise
That fact that you was wise
Not to confront the creator of Blunt
Your bitch was acting like a dick so I gave her what she want
Don't front on that ass when you pass the 49
That's where we write the rhymes by tons and none consist of guns
Don't represent but repent back to your vill
And don't listen to your mom when she says you got skills

Hook

What you got, beats and the rhymes that connect
And what you doing, my sole purpose is catching wreck
I don't stop, can't quit, got a hit never miss
Because we do it like that and now we do it like this

Jas Mace

I love to cash checks, I love the opposite sex
I love to catch wreck, plus I'd love to break your neck
Because you wack, and everybody knew this
I'm fat as Stacy Dash plus I'll leave that ass clueless
And like 16 ounces you get pounded
Rounded, I'm trying to make these dollar bills to billions
Ain't no killing you softly, I want to hear you scream
Jas Mace and Marchitect we represent the dream team

Marchitect

A yo, scream if you want it holler if you need it
Your battle raps as dumb as a drum now watch me beat it
And scrape your face on a cheese grader because I hate a
Corny entertainer or a skill-less beat creator
I never needed a closet to hang with The Outfit
It's Marchitect, you know what I'm about bitch
So are you crazy trying to daze me
Why you think I got dreads cause can't nobody fade me

Jas Mace

I keep it straight like 180
You rappers couldn't bake me if your name was Kevin
I'm rolling dice and hitting 7's and 11's
So doors get blown and chumps get thrown out the window
And when I say go let me hear your wack flow
You know you ain't freestyling, so stop lying
You kicked those same rhymes last week on the island
Always smiling, cause wack emcees humor me
And before I blew up, I still got more ass than South St.

Marchitect

Feel the heat when I burn until a crisp
I break it up like this got a hit and never miss
For years, I've been here giving crews the blues
No pouch, but still hold my own like kangaroos
Suckers bite my style but I'll never sweat it
Because my style's like equality, niggas is never gonna get it
Forget it, get those crazy thoughts out your head
Because I blow and I flow until the mics are dead

Hook

What you got, beats and the rhymes that connect
And what you doing, my sole purpose is catching wreck
I don't stop, can't quit, got a hit never miss
Because we do it like that and now we do it like this</pre>
