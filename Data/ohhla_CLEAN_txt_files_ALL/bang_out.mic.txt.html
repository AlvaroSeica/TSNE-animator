Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Iron Mic]
Iron Mic and them Ruthless boys, we bang out
Make it real hard, up in your hood, to hang out
If the drama's on, then so are them hammers to come out
When the Iron is on, nigga, you can get stomped out

[Iron Mic]
We gon' bring this shit back to Shaolin
Where ain't nothing change but the name, now let's get back to wilding
It's Planet of the Apes, gorillas on Staten Island
We slang crack, attack cats, them boys be acting violent
Planted back on the map, you with me, clap your iron
I'm back, let off another one, clap for Iron
Clap for Ruthless, clap cuz we that new shit
Sit back, and watch these Ruthless runningbacks run through shit
We not new, we been doing this
Stop flashing your watch, you might lose your wrist
Keep them cuffs on your dick and might lose your bitch
Hustle on the wrong strip, nigga, lose your bridge
Park on the wrong strip and might lose your whip
Come on, you know you can't fuck with this Ruthless kid
This Ruthless shit, fuck, is you stupid, bitch?
We bodeg' our cake, nigga, we gon' rule this shit

[Chorus 2X]

[Iron Mic]
We gon' turn the heat off, leave the beef done up quickest
Not sweet, cross me, you best believe we hit ya
Nigga, my music is money, I'm just trynna get richer
Bring it to your face, you ain't gotta get the picture
Fear for your life, we steal ice, peel on bike
We struggling and starving but we still alright
Blowing dro, twisting hoes, keep the clip in the four
It's Iron Mic, Ruthless, stupid, you ain't know?
When you see them 2/5th's, nigga, better get low
Take it off, this is a strip show, let me get those
Let me get that, give that New York Knick hat
You fucking out-of-towners, just for coming through you get jacked

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
