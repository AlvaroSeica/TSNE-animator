Song:   I Dont Care
Typed by: InsaneD420@aol.com

People say I talk too much
I don't care I talk too much
Momma say I failed in life
I don't care I failed in life
Daddy says I drink too much
I don't care I drink too much
People say I'm headed nowhere
And I don't fuckin care
Jimmy Johnson's gonna die
Sarah Suzie's gonna die
Everybody's dying slow
I don't give a fuck though
I'm only short like fifty bucks
I couldn't give fifty fucks
I could really use some help
You can go and fuck yourself
Everybody's gonna die
Terror fallin' from the sky 
Mothers with they children cry 
And I could give a fuck why
They say you'll never walk again
Well go plug the Sega in
I think somebody stole my truck
Tell someone who gives a fuck

[4x]
The entire world is falling

How much do they charge in there? 
Wait a minute, I don't care
I'ma shoot you in the face 
I'll tell you how the bullets taste
Critics say you immitate 
I don't give a fuckulate
50 million people dying 
Awwwww I'm crying
Tell me all the things you saw 
As if I give a fuck at all
You see me sittin in the chair 
People dying even there
Everything you saying to me 
Shhhhh, go right through me
If I was to pick it up 
I'd have to give a fuck, and I don't
I don't care nothin' bout it
I can't do nothin' bout it
I can't do nothin' for you
I don't care nothin' bout it
Rainforest burning down
War and riots all around
I'm inside like fuck 'em all
What's the main event on RAW?
Posion, mad cow disease
Can I get that with double cheese?
STD's steady spreadin'
Bareback up in this neden
I don't care

[4x]
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling

I don't care nothin' bout it
I can't do nothin' bout it
I can't do nothin' for you
I don't care nothin' bout it
Everyday when I wake up
All I really wanna do is die
And go to the next phase
Ground up flesh is consumed
Everyone is gonna die...
Fuck I ain't afraid to die
Go on shoot me in the eye
Do it see if I survive
Give it to me point blank
Better "BANG!"
Did you hit 'em? 
Yes, and I don't give a fuck less
Careful it's a dark night 
Give your money or your life
Take 'em both for all I care
Dump your bullets right here
If you notice on the door
Addicted crawlin' on the floor
Ask me did I ever care?
Nah...

[8x]
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling
The entire world is falling

[8x]
I don't care, I don't care</pre>
