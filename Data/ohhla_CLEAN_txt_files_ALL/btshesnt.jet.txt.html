Song:   But She's Not My Lover
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
I know, it usually is
And you've always made me smile
Every second I spend with you
It's so worth the while

[Chorus]
Because you, bring me JOY
but you're not my lover
No! No! No! Because you, bring me joy
but you're not my lover
No! No! No! Joy...

[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
I will lose all control
when I see you call my phone
What's crazy is we're not committed
but I do want you as my own

[Chorus]

{*skatting from 2:01 like "ba-dat-da-dat-da-da-dahh"*}
{*continues underneath Chorus until Chorus ends*}

[Chorus] - starting with "JOY"</pre>
