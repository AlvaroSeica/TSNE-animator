[Intro - T.I. - talking]
Damn, has it been that long? (haha)
Say what happened since I've been gone, homie?
Y'all got the game all wrong man, it's too pretty in here
Let's say we take it back to the trap one time (hey!)

[Chorus - T.I.] - w/ ad libs
I went from rollin with them rocks on the block
To controllin my position at the top of every chart and I will not stop, bopper
We rock, then we roll, then you stop and we don't and we blow
Yeah ya know, yeah ya know, yeah ya know, yeah ya know
Yeah ya know, yeah ya know, yeah ya know, yeah ya know
First we rock, then we roll, then you stop and we don't (we don't), we 
blow (we blow), ya know

[Verse 1 - T.I.]
In the middle of the fight, I'm so cool (yeah), everybody wonder how I go through (what?)
All of this, half of which would have broke you
Came out smellin like a rose and got more jewels (haha)
Worldwide, bicostal, local, niggaz all respect, in case the boy go postal
'Cause I ain't got a damn minute, ain't no 'tude
You know Bankhead ain't raise no fool
Playin poker with the Devil, goin all in
Kickin doors over just to let my dogs in
So many rides, never catch a nigga walkin
In a G5 tryin to fit a bunch of broads in
Then, we landin laughin (haha). chicks with fantastic asses
Extravagent habits, as if we've never seen tragic happen (hey!)
Make magic happen with cash I'm actually catchin Magic
In the market for lavish mansions and NBA expansions
I was cussin out felons in '04, so know dough ain't shit to me
Way past expectancy but ain't even half as big as a nigga fittin to be, just so

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Hey, so fly, why would I wanna land for?
Everything you could ask for and more
Your choice, you could even be a fan or
Hate to see a nigga get a hundred grand for
Bein the motherfuckin man, won't stand for
The rap wars, all the goin back and forth
Nip it in the bud, kill it like cancer
But when it rain, then it pours, that's for damn sure
In France, bonjour merci oui
The same people on tour, on TV
They signed him, should of kept your reciept
Got a refund, 'cause he sure can't see me
Who keeps CDs on repeat?
Stuck in MP3's to 3 weeks?
At the gates on the day I was released
The only time you will ever see me free
Big money J, much as you can get for me
Atlantic Records said just make another hit for me
I tell em cut a hundred million dollar check for me
Like it or not, don't lose no respect for me
Never mind what I did, 'cause the best comin
I'm the King and the game like chess to me
So put the cash in the bag, give the rest to the
Attendant puttin gas in the jet for me

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
I got a new swag and it's a new day
Here we go again Toomp, what it do J? (what up Toomp?)
If you recall, I'm the one you used to move yay
Now I got a new Audemars with a blue face
Hoppin on a G4 jet, no suitcase
Whole new wardrobe and a new face
Change clothes if a stain on my shoelace
T.I. raw like sushi, touché
If the King ain't back, who the hell am I?
Bringin homicide to the game, no alibi
Can't tell a lie to the judge, I'm guilty
Your Honor, do you mind but the guy tried to kill me
I could still be, in a trap now
AK 'round, little yay 'round
100K downstairs by the trey pound
But if they wonderin who runnin the A now?

[Chorus - T.I.] - w/ ad libs
You know, yeah ya know, yeah ya know, yeah ya know
Yeah ya know, yeah ya know, yeah ya know, yeah ya know
First we ride, then we roll, then you stop and we don't and we blow

[Break - T.I.] - 2X - w/ ad libs
Say you know that we rock, in control we don't stop
We gon' blow when we drop, let you know we on top
First we ride, then we roll, then you stop and we don't and we blow

Yeah ya know

[Outro - T.I. - talking]
Prison ain't change me, it made me worse, right Pop?
If I want it, I'm a come get it
I ain't askin for it, I'm a take it
We takers nigga</pre>
