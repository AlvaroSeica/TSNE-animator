[Violent J]
Dreadful dust, gloomy sun
All blank, matter gone
Lifeless, vast, all done
Nature &amp; trees, fallen
Gray skies, death, dead air
No where, nothing's here
Except me I'm in luck
Or am I, so fucked
Loom searching, no man
Time unwind, shits so bad
Where it all go?, vanish
Replaced by agony &amp; anguish
Flat surface meets the eye
In every direction I tried
Though hazy I see something crazy
A yellow dot of a daisy

[Chorus]
Oh shit I've seen a beaming of a daisy
Our will to survive
It's amazing
Look motherfucker look it's a daisy
Our will to survive
[2x]

[Violent J]
Everything changed when I saw this
Blinking in the distance, flawless
In my world of dust &amp; plains
The sight of color rushed blood in my veins
It stood out flashing again
I can see it faintly calling me in
Like a lighthouse for a ship in the fog
I got excited &amp; started to jog
Towards it "What the fuck is that?"
Came up on it fully attacked
Growing up out of the sands alone
Sprung for nothing, bringing it on
I smelled it like magic cane
Euphoria of new life straight to the brain
I haven't smelled anything for years
A new beginning is what this is

[Chorus]
Oh shit I've seen a beaming of a daisy
Unknown to survive
It's amazing
Look motherfucker look it's a daisy
Unknown to survive
[2x]

[Violent J]
I stand right here, near this
This shit means life exists
It all dried up, cold, tragic
Until now, a beautiful magic
Another chapter, a new chance
Light in the dark here to advance
The dawn will come life will flourish
As sure as it perished yesterday
And is there more around?
Somehow spurtin' up out of the ground
I thought this planet was done
A dead rock floatin', abandoned
I couldn't stand it, dammit, hopeless
It all changes now that I know this
What brought this here?
Who?
Decided it's time for the new
The yellow head &amp; green stem
Tomorrow what would this mean to them?
Picture a jungle standing in the middle
It all starts right here with this one little
Daisy
Daisy
Daisy
Daisy
Daisy

[Chorus]
Oh shit I've seen a beaming of a daisy
Our will to survive
It's amazing
Look motherfucker look it's a daisy
Our will to survive
[2x]</pre>
