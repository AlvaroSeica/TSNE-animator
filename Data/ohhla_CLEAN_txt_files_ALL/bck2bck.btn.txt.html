[ Psycho Les ]
Groovy
Haha
Dude
Put your drinks up
Put your drinks up
Put your drinks up
Put your drinks up
Let the beat go
Come on
Put your l's up
Come on
Yeah
Say what
Big Psych, nigga
What's your name?

[ VERSE 1: Psycho Les ]
Call me Les Dibiase, I'm Psycho like a Nazi
Playin with a hottie while you home playin Yazzy
Camilo on the 1's and 2's movin the party
That's when the waitress brought a Kamikaze
I was like, "No! Pass the Courvoisi"
10 minutes later cerveza under the meza
She was horny for the pony, so I had to bless her
I shot sperm in her perm, I don't have to tell you
I was like, "May the power of Psych compel you"
I'm stone crazier than any nigga from Bellview
I know you see my monster truck in your rear view
Musically I'ma always be the shit
I'm not only the producer, I'm the nigga that spit

[ CHORUS ]
We keep diggin in the crates (back to back)
Hittin state after state (back to back)
We keep rippin these shows (back to back)
We keep spittin these flows (back to back)
Coppin drug after drug (back to back)
Rockin club after club (back to back)
Five million dollar cribs (back to back)
And all we do is make hits (back to back)

[ VERSE 2: Psycho Les ]
Hip-hop cats, they know I'm the nutty one
They don't wanna buy tracks, they just wanna study them
Pull you out the hat like (Hey!) you the lucky one
Everything classical, fuck the money, son
I got this bad chick uptown, she's my slutty hon
Even on her period we can still have some bloody fun
Nuts is back, so spread the rumor
Rock this in your set and be a happy consumer
Perfect for a bus or a train commuter
(D-d-)download if you in front of a computer
Spark the buddha, "Get out the way bitch," like Luda
Pull up to Wet Willy's on a scooter
Who the - fuck wan test Psych Les, QU's finest
Once the king puts his thing in the nappy
You gon' be like the prince and sing when you're happy

Beatnuts y'all
Beatnuts y'all
Beatnuts y'all
Beatnuuuuuuts
