[Intro: 2Pac interview]
"Niggaz is telling me about this Illuminati shit while I'm in jail like, dollars and all that.
 That's another way to keep your self-esteem low, that's another way to keep you unconfident.
 And I'm putting the K cause I'm killing that Illuminati shit, trust me.
 If these motherfuckers wanted to kill you, why the fuck they gon' tell Farrakhan?
 Why they gon' tell the Nation of Islam? Why they gon' tell this nigga in jail about the plan?
 How do he know? How'd it leak to him? Who told him? Who told him, the Pope? Who?
 Cause they like, 'the Pope' and 'the money' - aw c'mon man, get the FUCK outta here!"

[Talib Kweli]
Oh you niggaz wanna get deep?
Niggaz wanna kick knowledge?
Y'all niggaz ain't deep man, y'all niggaz lost me
soon as you steady tryna tell me which rappers in the fuckin Illuminati
Then I'm like, show me the proof, right?
Niggaz start talkin about the anti-Christ and aliens and shit
Save the ghost stories for the kids nigga, I'm a grown ass man (stop it!)
Let's go, let's go!

You can lead a man to a drink but you can't make him take a sip
You can lead a man to a link but that don't mean he gon' click
What's this? Y'all ain't really on no deep shit
I peeped it, scared of a muh'fuckin secret
Society and only been with people you agree with, you scared of a challenge
Scared to death, only thing worse is your silence
Illuminatis enlightened, the owl see in the darkness
Masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed
Egyptologists and scholars, symbologists at the college
will all acknowledge that ancient Kemet is where it started
Way farther back than the Knights, or the Rite to the Scottish
You need to wake up, no new Bugatti
Yes~! My enemy tryin to stop me
But I don't stand a chance if I can't identify 'em properly
Illuminati as we know it, started in Bavaria
Years before it landed on the shores of America
The mission, abolishment of government and religion
They were enemies of the state and they was hated by the Christians
They was poets, they was scholars, the early Illuminati
was sorta like the students in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables
The modern day politicians would diss 'em, turnin them into martyrs
This in turn inspired the foundin fathers
The vast majority masons
who were the subject of the Illuminati found this fascination, the order was insipiration
(Keep goin) And ain't no disrespect to the masons
But you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation
Only those in league with Satan, need to hide infomation
That's how you catch a ride to your final destination
Where the proof? Show 'em proof, put it all on the table
When the facts are intact, ain't no need for a fable
Good versus evil is primitive, real life's more complex
What's your context?
They put the symbols on the dollar bill, the monument, the obelisk
They honorin Columbia, the children of the colonists
You can trace it back, to the root, trace it back again
It's really just another case of stealin from the African
Racism and vanity, justify the fail of flesh
You property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh?
Population control is real, you know the deal
But still perpetuate the cycle of violence, we known to hold the steel
No, I don't need no fuckin chorus
Used to read so many books thought I was a hoarder down at Borders
Like "Behold the Pale Horse" or, "The New World Order"
But you really don't know what you readin if you really don't know the author
A lot of Satan worshippers stuck up in the propaganda
Unsubstantiated lies with no proof, a bunch of slander
Of course there are forces against you and that's a fact
Then don't get caught in the distraction, it's bigger than any rapper
The truly oppressed ain't got the luxury of inventin a monster
The devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert
What they doin's so sinister
Worse than any blood sacrifice you can imagine, iller than any cinema
The Federal Reserve, the World Bank, and the I.M.F.
Helpin the poor get poorer, you in debt until your dyin breath
The food, the vaccines, humanitarian aide
They want control of the region, they really tryin to get paid
Obey thy consumer, make a product out of man
Where's the conspiracy? It's always been the plan
Y'all niggaz scared of one-world currency
But still payin your taxes, it ain't the Illuminati that worry me
Lack of spiritual energy, suicidal tendencies
Unwitting soldiers in the armies of your enemy
I'm leakin information so follow me down the wormhole
Same reason that they called Bradley Manning a turncoat

[Outro: sample from the movie "Menace II Society"]
"C'mon man, we supposed to be brothers!"
"Oh what you tryna get smart?
 Nigga you tryna kick some knowledge?
 Nigga FUCK that!
 Gimme your motherfuckin jewelry nigga, take that shit off!
 Oh you got a pager too huh?
 You a baller huh? You a baller huh?
 Gimme that motherfuckin shit!
 Better me than the motherfuckin cops nigga!"
