[Intro]
Fuckin cockroaches
Motherfuckin Freebandz!
Want me to be the bad guy? Wanna fuckin play?
No? Cartel nigga!

[Chorus]
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up by my ears, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm 'bout to cop the Porsche, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take 'em Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

[Future]
I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the East, where niggaz split your canteloupe
You tell me what you wanna meet I'm comin with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud, I'm laced up to the fucking throat
A Porsche, Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, droppin all cash
Gutter to the death of me, I'm stickin to the recipe
Slug, deal with Colombians - I know Sosa
All I got is my balls and my word and fuck the roaches
Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofas
The money got me geeked, like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused

[Chorus]

[Drake]
On the hood you see the stallion, passenger a stallion
Niggaz gettin nervous, I'm passin out the Valium
I suggest you pop it, but please don't get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkin up in 400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes'll see me, be like that's how you feelin
Used to stay up after 12, now you're worth like 12 million
Boy you did, boy you did it; you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fucking women that knew Biggie so it really ain't no biggie
It's just OVO and XO, and Freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto bitch I'm Tony in my city ah?

[Chorus]

[Future]
Another shot of Cuervo, she'll be comin back for pesos
When your blood filled with petrol, it's hard for hoes to let go
See AK ain't no peace, nigga I'll split your tato
Ain't nothin 'bout me ordinary, I come with the llello
I move like a mob boss, it's gon' take a army
The world is mine nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin with me, you'll move to Alaska by the mornin
You want me to be the bad guy? Ok, it's on then
Champagne spillin, crab cakes e'rywhere
My white bitch trippin, she sayin I ain't playin fair
I'm about to cop a tiger, and put it in the castle
Freebandz accompany it so nigga it don't matter, ay!

[Chorus]</pre>
