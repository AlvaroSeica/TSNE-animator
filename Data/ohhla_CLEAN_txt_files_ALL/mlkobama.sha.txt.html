[Chapter 4]
Born January, 1929
Atlanta, Georgia, they were poor but
He was a good child, from a good home
Read the Good Book, took the good road
And at 15, he was in college now
On the fast track, but on that last lap
Somewhere deep inside, he-he realized
A life serving The Lord, how can you surpass that?
And so he became a preacher, just like his father was
Montgomery Baptist Church, tired but he had to work
'Cause those days, there wasn't much hope if you don't pray
In the segregated South, where they degraded and played us out
He said, "Forget the law, it's okay to disobey and resist
when civil disobedience has a noble cause"
And it's done non violently most of all
Then, along came a seamstress, by the name of Rosa who chose ta
Not give her seat up
When they threw her in jail a movement would erupt
A 380-day bus boycott where Martin was the leader
And so they refused to ride, unified
They would rather walk than pay one fair with laws that's unfair
So they walked, and they walked 
Til the city buses were vacant 
Like, "We ain't gon' stop, 'til we get desegregation"
Then they gave in...
but our victory was bitter sweet, seeing all that misery
Fast forward, new day, on with the crusade
Next stop Freedom Rides, they continued risking lives
As a group of interracial youth take two
Buses through the deep south, everybody freaking out
Just exercising constitutional rights
And they, beat us wit lead pipes, buses got slashed tires
Bombs through the window, they watched it catch fire
But, Martin, see he knew their violence would backfire
And when it made the evening news, that meant the world was watchin 
And the president, had no other option but to hop in..
So in comes The National Guard
And we won that battle, but the war raged on
So young Martin he was back on his job
Went from Albany to Birmingham, really I don't understand
How they can treat a learned man, like he wasn't worth a damn
They took Martin, locked him up 
Still he said, "Ain't no stoppin us"
Came out a renewed man
Said, "Let's find a new plan"
They knew that their phones were tapped 
So they spoke in code for that
He said to overflow the jails would be the only way
Create a crisis - make 'em negotiate
He was right and ordered segregation be let go
And in '63 they signed King's Manifesto
Fast forward to Selma, Bloody Sunday
Who'da thought this one day
Would be one of the most N-O, T-O ,R-I, O, U-S
The U.S. would ever, know
And they murdered us, hosed us
Beat us, but they couldn't beat us
Demandin our rights to vote, and Martin would lead us
Perhaps his finest hour, is securing our freedoms
Bombs at his home, still he kept goin
Blade through his chest plate, he was back thee next day
In and outta chains, he shouldered the pain 
Only thing that could stop him was that bullet with his name, God Bless

The unauthorized biography of MLK, Jr.
From being the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
Or his Ghandhian non violent approach to fighting for equality
He's probably most recognized for his Lincoln Memorial Speech "I Have a Dream"
{Free at last, free at last, THANK GOD ALMIGHTY, we're free at last!}
He wasn't alive to see it but that dream came true, and here he is

Born Barack Hussein Obama
Mama white as a dove, father black as they come
Honolulu, Hawaii is where he was first brought up
Growin up he was caught up, playin ball, poor grades
He was just livin up to what Black people were thought of
Til one day he said that's not us, not at all
Buckled down, got into Columbia, Harvard Law
Spun around, right into The U.S. Senate
And after that keynote speech at the DNC, he would be
looked as someone who can lead the way
in a Presidential race for a country in need of change
And when he beat McCain he became
The firsst African American to be elected President
Looking back, they say Martin walked so Obama could run
Three dots 'cause his legacy has just begun...
