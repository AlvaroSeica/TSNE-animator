[About 20 seconds of faint conversation by a group of men 
complaining about Heavy D. taking their girls is heard]

(Cause he's The Overweight Lover Heavy D!)

[Heavy D.]
Coolin in my crib and I'm cold, maxin
Call up a cutie, I'm in the mood for relaxin
Get my phone book from, top o' the shelf
I'll dial 66 - hm, I better keep it to myself
Call up a cutie with a triple star next to it
She says, "Hello," we con-versate a bit
Invite her over for a candlelight dinner
Believe me when I tell you that this girlie is a winner
Shortly after that, I hear the doorbell ring
Turn on the radio, Anita Baker starts to sing
Open up the door and I kiss her on the cheek
She's so nice, polite, petite, so sweet
Sit her on the couch and uh, remove her coat
Squat next to her, *ahem* clear my throat
Whisper in her ear, told her what she wants to hear
Let her know that, "Have no fear - Heavy D.'s here"
And..

[Chorus]
Gyrlz they, gyrlz they love me
(Cause he's The Overweight Lover Heavy D!)
Gyrlz they, gyrlz they love me
(Cause he's The Overweight Lover Heavy D!)

[Heavy D.]
Take my hand, walk with me
I'm the imperial, Overweight Lover MC Heavy D.
Now that I've introduced myself correctly
Do you have a moment to spend some time with me?
Would you like a drink, maybe a Piña, Colada 
A strawberry Daiquiri, a wine from Havana
It really doesn't matter, the choice is yours
and when you're through with your drink, we'll take a walk out-doors
Gazed at the stars, walked down the boardwalk
Sit by the beach and talk lover's talk
Make a quick call on my cellular phone
Some type of limousine to pick us up and take us home
Ahh! - an enjoyable night
The mood was smooth and everything was alright
It may be hard for you, but it's easy for me
Cause girls, the girls, the girls, THEY LOVE ME!

[Chorus 2X]

[DJ Eddie F. cuts and scratches]
