[Lil' Fame]
Y'all must have forgot - that the homeboy Fitzroy's known ta
knock niggaz the FUCK out, straight Roy Jones ya
Clean up yo' fucked up ways, cause the streets is back
It's William and Womack, nigga come on in
You see, cars, je-wels, platinum plaques don't mean SHIT
if you ain't got respect in your hood
And that's what you call gangster, stupid? Well looka here Cupid
We don't need your fake-ass love! Because
99.9 of the industry is full of cock blowers
They slow mackin niggaz
Industry mascots for the videos and radio
Grown-ass men, performin the art of fellatio
Where the fuck is your morals?!
You deserted your hood and now you're hidin out
But we here for them niggaz in your hood you forgot about
We love the hate, we STILL underrated so
as loud as you can, all you motherfuckers say it
SAY IT~!

[Chorus]

[Billy Danze]
Y'all must have forgot - William Danze, the extension of a thug
The slightest mention of a thug, send tension through a club
It's a brand new trend in rap, you niggaz are sick in rap
You stupid for thinkin that, this Family can get with that
I dedicate my love in the street, thugs on the beat
Homies that hustle to eat, to stay on their feet
And I'm a sellout, and bail out, from hardcore tactics
and celebrate with hatin ass, thong wearin bastards?
Don't fuck with my integrity, have Fame groovy
It's all real, you know Bill, you STILL can't move me
You're the reason why the game gon' bad
You switch hitter, you dilettante nigga rockin a rainbow flag
That's why Fame asked, "Where the fuck is your morals?!"
Be an oral expert to network, I can't do nuttin for ya
(WE LOVE THE HATE!) We still underrated so
as loud as you can, all you motherfuckers say it
SAY IT~!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah! Ah ah, gotta love us nigga
Better hate us nigga!
I know you hate us nigga!
I KNOW YOU HATE US NIGGA
You still gotta love us nigga
You hate that you gotta love us nigga
Ah ah, hate us nigga
Still gotta love us, FIYAH!!
