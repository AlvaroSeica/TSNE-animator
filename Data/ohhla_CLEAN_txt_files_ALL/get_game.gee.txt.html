[B.G.]
now if you know me then you know I'm a beast
If you know me then you know I don't be lyin when I tell you I got it cheap
If you know me then you know I'm a G
If you don't want your old lady to get fucked don't bring her around me
man I'm hotter than you ever would be
dog I'm realer just cooler so smoother than you ever could be
I always put the hood in my rap
Cause I ride through the trap no strap ho face in my lap
I'm a man I be holdin my own
disrespect me if you want and I can promise you a hole in your dome
I'm off the block when they play it for keeps
and I was taught don't ride with a nigga who ain't sided with me
You got somethin to say then say it to me
Don't talk behind my back be a man homie bring it to me
Don't trip cause gizzle done came up please, stop hatin start paper chasin and
Get your game up

[Chorus]
Get your game up nigga get your game up
If it cost less than ten then put that chain up
Get your game up nigga get your game up
If it cost less than ten then nigga put that chain up
Get your weight up nigga get your weight up
You see me comin through stuntin man pick your face up
Get your weight up nigga get your weight up
You see me comin through stuntin man pick your face up

look, I went from broke to rich rich to back broke
then back to gettin 20 thousand a show
I went from weed to dope to speed ballin
I cleaned myself up and I'm a money fuckin holic
ho's just love how I carry myself
I look in the mirror sometimes and wanna marry myself
I be lookin how I wonder how I got the swagger myself
most of it come from my daddy love to slim left
I'm a fool from the U.P.T.
when I ask hot girls, 'what it do'? they say 'do it to me'
I'm official anywhere on the globe
I can travel round the world in 30 days with 30 different ho's
man I'm back and I'm out of control man
I'm floodin the bank until they say they can't hold no mo
don't trip cause gizzle done came up (uh uh)
please, stop hatin start paper chasin and get your game up

[Chorus]
Get your game up nigga get your game up
If it cost less than ten then put that chain up
Get your game up nigga get your game up
If it cost less than ten then nigga put that chain up
Get your weight up nigga get your weight up
You see me comin through stuntin man pick your face up
Get your weight up nigga get your weight up
You see me comin through stuntin man pick your face up

I ain't no mobsta but gizzle is made I'm a tell ya
Real niggaz respect the game bustas feel played
Real niggaz could grow in the hood
Cause real niggaz do what they want bustas do what they could
on the real I'm like the law in the streets
I can pulll up hop out and leave my keys in the car in the streets
nigga know what behind come fuckin with me
more murder more kill more heat bustin fuckin with me
so I advise you to stay on your level nigga stay in your place
be smart just stay out the way
dog just stay in your league cause its a lot
of lions, tigers and bears runnin through these trees
and believe I'm the king of the jungle I'm the coach of the team
I can't miss with the scope and the beam
Don't trip cause gizzle done came up please
Stop hatin start paper chasin and get your game up

[Chorus]
Get your game up nigga get your game up
If it cost less than ten then put that chain up
Get your game up nigga get your game up
If it cost less than ten then nigga put that chain up
Get your weight up nigga get your weight up
You see me comin through stuntin man pick your face up
Get your weight up nigga get your weight up
You see me comin through stuntin man pick your face up </pre>
