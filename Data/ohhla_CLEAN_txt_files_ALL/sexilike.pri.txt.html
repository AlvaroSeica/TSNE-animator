Typed by: webmaster@mattv.zzn.com

I like sex, I like sex, I like sex, I like sex
I like sex in the mornin like sex in the night
like sex in the evenin wanna fuck all night
I like sex in the morning like sex in the day
like sex in the tub pull out the drain
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Said I don't want to get stuck on you
I don't want to talk to you
I'm not feelin all confused
I just want sex cuz I'm loose
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Douze Francs, douze francs
CMON!
I already heard your name
And I have always felt this way
I am going so insane
I think I'll have some sex today
C'mon
Douze francs Douze francs!
