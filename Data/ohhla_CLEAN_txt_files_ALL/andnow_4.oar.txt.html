"And now for something completely different"

[Verse 1: Trials]
Hey fuck you we crush crews the oar way
I'm sicker then using period blood for war paint
Fans rush the stage then half these ladies
Got fucked, got dressed, and left with bastard babies
These days I never chase women
'cause thats like playing rock-paper-scissors, Limbless
No use and thats an easy mistake
I treat a rapper like a habit, both easy to break
I say take one look your dealing with a heavy weight
Suffa got a bed but I gotta bitch in every state
Strap the latex I'm the pin prick between safe sex
and having to take an aids test
I can say Cdub is holding em' back
The only thing holding em' back is being overly wack
Hey messing with the oars of funk
You get crushed like you gave Big Pun the top bunk

[Chorus]
So shut the fuck up.
Funkoars pound the stage until the floor breaks
So get the fuck out.
Yeah we drink the rum until its out the bail
So what the fucks up.
To my crew in the front row we ain't never gonna fall off
Fuck no!, fuck no!, fuck no!, fuck no!, fuck no!, fuck that!

[Hook]
Now you left in a daze
Never step on stage
Now you left in a daze
Mic weapons engaged

[Verse 2: Sesta]
I'm coming in and on em anonymously, not monogamously
Get off the top and then they're leaving with their novelty
Honestly got no property
Thats a problem for someone dumb enough we want ya company
Fucking me dont mean loving me, fuck it
I dont want no bun in the oven so face fuck em
Say she love it but she makes her weight to the bucket
Chuck it, but I ain't the greatest of nothing
But shes on her fucking knees like she's praying or something
Eight in the door rushing, gatecrashing the floor
It's nothing but oars and their mates and they may take it all
Praise the lord for the drunks and the town of drunks
With the town slut doing an in and out when they found us
Or see me kicking it drinking with village idiots
Screaming their innocent while spewing up bile into em
Or getting violent and swinging nine irons
At bystanders and fans at random on the land

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hons]
Check it out now I'mma tell you what the oars about
We about to milk this scene dry and take the carcus to the slaughter house
Shit you ain't thought about the crew that cats talk about
On stage in your city until the mic cords start shorting out
Turn the heat up, Semi x turn the beat up
Flux fresh on the scratch like a car thats just been keyed up
And you need more then luck if your ripping Honz
The punchlines that I deliver hit harder then Whitney was
Work a shitty job, 5 days and 50 bob
And after debt collectors I got just enough to get written off
My crew the dirtiest, Funkoars you heard of us
Second album down by now you know our purpose is
To take this scene over - who the fucks gonna stop us
When half the cats that enter battles these days are fucking soft cocks
We get you open like a fresh beer
So ahead of our time we the number one crew of next year

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Tell your team I bring harm and never take that risk
Put the scene in my palm and then I make that fist</pre>
