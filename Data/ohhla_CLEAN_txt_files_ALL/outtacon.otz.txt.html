[Intro]
One two one two!
Y'all knew I wasn't gonna stay quiet! YAOWA!!!

[Verse One]
I ain't even gotta give this too much thought
Joell Ortiz won every war that he ever fought
This ain't no different I'm listenin you the king of New York?
Lil' homie you ain't the king of New York, you the next thing on my fork
The messenger with all them rings on that horse
Carrying kings heads 'til I kick you in your chest
And you cough and fall into a bottomless pit homie you know how many bodies that fit?
When we met you said it's an honor man the yaowa can spit
Maybe that's why you left me out of that shit
Maybe that's why the Slaughterhouse ain't get dissed
Or maybe I'm not on your radar, you feel you ain't gotta acknowledge my clique
Either way I personal train this beat it gotta get ripped
You rich rappers can't respond with all the dollars you get
Gangsta rappers can't retaliate with hollows and clips
And you fashion rappers wear the kind of jeans that hardly get zipped
So zip it I got this shit, real hip hop in this bitch!
The apocalypse has fell upon us watch the zombies I spit
The walking dead I've been a monster shorty y'all can get bit
And never turn I'm immune to these rappers y'all callin sick
I stomped the red carpet holdin my dick
And throw tomatoes at the podium for wack awards that y'all niggas get
Then stand up and scream YAOWA then dip, and smack a legend on the way out of that bitch
'Cause I don't big up the elite
The elite can get it too you all fit under my feet
You all victims all chitlins when a nigga tryin to eat
I'll see it to it y'all missin like a wino nigga teeth
Anybody can get it - old nigga, new nigga 
Him nigga, you nigga, one nigga, two niggas! 
A few niggas, I do niggas harm with these bars
It was brave, you took a chance like Monopoly cards
Put that telly you trying to check in, boy, that property's ours
Can't get a W on Broadway, I'm NEW YORK ALL DAY~!
Yeah, that's where the boss stay, you no hear that oye?
A hundred Ricans runnin at you +Chief+ like Okoye
Last time in Compton I was kickin it with Jorge
I rocked with some cons/Kan's out +West+ like the boy 'Ye
But I don't claim king even though my name ring
And I had China in the Bay, we call Beijing
Rodeo to Diego they telling you the same thing
Chico be in Sacramento so much he can claim +King+
But that's the west coast, I'm from this coast
I'll leave the king of LA to Dre, I was this close
to stayin Aftermath, but lamped out like a Genie
But Dre you a fuckin gangster and Kirdis you're such a sweetie
And guess what, I'm a +Free Agent+ again if y'all ever need me
But back to these bars, I'm hungry, this beat is gon' feed the needy
Y'all lookin like granny's ziti, zucchini out in Tahiti
On Fiji with Erykah Badu's booty in a bikini (haaaa!)
Your main chick is a Precious, my side chick is a RiRi
I fuck her then take her out for fries and a panini
I ain't a rap nigga, I'm a nigga that rap
Before this, y'all saw the cypher, I ain't bringing that back
Why should I recycle bars when my mind is a flight to Mars?
And the force that I come across was like rhyming inside a star
with the Universe on my back, your human verses is wack
I grab my extraterrestrial testicles when I rap
And tell Earth suck it (SUCK IT!), tell the planet try it
I turn this bitch into Independence Day without the lucky drunk pilot
I love competition, constructing a composition
of destruction, putting Destructicons in the calm position
I'm Optimus Prime trucking your boulevard, just wishin'
That a star screams so I can go on a bombing mission
You raised the bar high, I set the bar higher
You gon' learn though, inferno scorch a bonfire</pre>
