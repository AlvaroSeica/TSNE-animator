[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, Yeah, This what we call swag right here
This when you come up to the party you know you gettin in
You aint even gotta park your car or none of that
Yaknawmean, Every thing's V.I.P. when we do it like this

[Hook 1: Inspectah Deck (Fes Taylor)]
I got some pour maison (What), Some Don Perion (Yeah)
Gwap in my pocket and some fly shit on
I'm just swaggin', Yeah, Just swaggin'

[Inspectah Deck]
I'm checkin shorty at the bar, Built like a tank
Chest bustin out her bra, Ma what you wanna drink
She tried to blow me off like foam on the float
But hunny high class, The belt alone cost a note
I'm grown man status, Won't cower to none
I see I gotta shine light and show the power of sun
Let me grind from the back, Shot a few lines see where your mind's at
I knew in due time let I'd getcha, Meanwhile your throwin it back
One leg's on the speaker, How open is that
She said my name is Destiny but call me Barbara
Asked me what's my name I said Charlie Parker
(Hahaha) Cause I could do magic girl
Go hard till the mornin, Flatten out your curls
She smiled like that's what's up
Pinned your boy on the wall and she backed it up
Doin tricks, Made it clap, Made it snap and such
While her man's on the side line mad as fuck

[Hook 2: Inspectah Deck, (Fes Taylor)]
I'm just swaggin', Yeah, Just swaggin', Uhh
I got some pour maison (What), Some Don Perion (Yeah)
Gwap in my pocket and some fly shit on
I'm just swaggin', (What you doin) Just swaggin'

[Fes Taylor]
I'm Taylor too fly baby, Dealership buyin a Mercedes
When it come to ladies, I still drive em crazy
Maybe you could end up in my crib if you straddle me
(Uh huh) And I aint askin if you can stay with me
(Nope) Just cause you lay with me, You like my favorite V
I got mean black book Ma, A to Z
Bread like the bakery with cheese in the middle
Hoodie matchin my fitted, Jeans is a grip too
My kicks new, Upgrade switch to crisp blue Jay's number two
Plus my wrist cool, So chill cop a bottle to poor
Victoria Secret drawers you can model it all
For real, I aint into dancin, But I'm into sexin
I see your booty popin, Like you bendin stretchin
Some niggas trick it, Thinkin it's an investment
Had more celebrity chicks then the Fresh Prince
Say they love my swag, Hundreds are blown Fes
You copped a new Hydai, No it's not a Jag, Nope

[Hook 3: Inspectah Deck, (Fes Taylor)]
I got some pour maison (What), Some Don Perion (Yeah)
Gwap in my pocket and some fly shit on
I'm just swaggin'</pre>
