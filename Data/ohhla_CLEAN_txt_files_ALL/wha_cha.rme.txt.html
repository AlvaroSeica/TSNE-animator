[Young Rome]
50 Grand lets get this in one take
[Marques Houston]
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
Its ya boi MH y'all
[Young Rome]
And ya boi Young Rome
[Marques Houston]
But I guess y'all already know dat
I'm back on a track with my nigga T Scott
[Young Rome]
I see ya Scott
[Marques Houston]
You know how we get down
Yo, y'all check dis out

[Marques Houston 1]
We got some ladies in here shaking like they dancing for money
A couple of them looking like play boy bunny
The way you taking it to the ground it aint funny
Mami come here and let me see ya strip fro me
Ya players in here don't cha act funny
Get your freak on, nigga grab you a little hunny
Lick on my body you can call me the ice mami
I came here to find me a body

[Young Rome 1]
Ya body's killin me
I'm feeling the energy
You sending me Emily
My love is strong like there's 10 of me
Got me stutterin my speech slur
Taking my time to get all my words
Shawty bring your homie Veronica for Marques
She know we partners
We can slow dance in the darkness
Baby never leave me
Its good to receive me
Believe me I'm off the heezy when I need be

[Chorus]
Hey little mami what cha doin tonight
Me and my peeps we gone get rocked tonight
Come get in my drop top
First we was like whoa now we like whoa
Hey little mami what cha doin tonight
Me and my peeps we gone get rocked tonight
So get in my drop top
I got cha like whoa and you got me like whoa

[Marques Houston 2]
Its hot in herre I think they need a diaper
They all on my dick now that I fuck with Pipe Piper
Remember I told you we get those girls hyper
Now move girl
Like your ass is on fire
Shack your body, body
Move your body, body
In this party
Don't hurt nobody, body
The way you move it
Ridiculous
I'm think bout sticking it
Come on baby girl and get with this

[Chorus]
Hey little mami what cha doin tonight
Me and my peeps we gone get rocked tonight
Come get in my drop top
First we was like whoa now we like whoa
Hey little mami what cha doin tonight
Me and my peeps we gone get rocked tonight
So get in my drop top
I got cha like whoa and you got me like whoa

[Young Rome 2]
We creep the streets
Lets meet at the telle
Shake your booty ma
Is that really skin or jelly
Turn around let me see that diamond pierce in your belly
I'm really ready but my thugs is really ready to shake the building
We all crunk as hell but we chillin (I'm cool)
When I saw little mama
Tell your friends you out
Cause we gone little mama (we out)

[Chorus]
Hey little mami what cha doin tonight
Me and my peeps we gone get rocked tonight
Come get in my drop top
First we was like whoa now we like whoa
Hey little mami what cha doin tonight
Me and my peeps we gone get rocked tonight
So get in my drop top
I got cha like whoa you got me like whoa

[Marques talking]
