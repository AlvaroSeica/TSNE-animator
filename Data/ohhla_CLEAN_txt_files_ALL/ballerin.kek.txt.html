(*talking*) 
Peep game, feel this, I'm in here with my um 
Herschelwood click, know I'm saying 
We ain't nothing but some uh, ballers 
Steady balling in the mix, know I'm tal'n bout 
Balling, balling in the mix 
Everything I done broke, Lil' Keke gon' fix 
  
[Lil' Keke] 
I keep balling, balling in the mix 
I'm a pimp not a trick, hitting licks for my bricks 
Sweets and sticks, equal platinum hits 
Riding in the Benz, screens on watching flicks 
Can't forget, Herschelwood click is so damn thick 
Hoes on dick, they ain't shit I hit the pussy and split 
Peep this game, of a real life baller 
Down in Texas watch the plexers, young shot caller 
Now how many playas, get to live they dream 
Come up in the game, and get to exploit some of that green 
Know what I mean, if you's a hustler of course ya do 
And if you ain't a baller, I ain't talking to you cause uh 
  
[Hook] 
Ballers, balling in the mix 
Everything I done broke, Lil' Keke gon' fix 
I keep balling, balling in the mix 
I'm a pimp not a trick, hitting licks for my bricks 
Ballers, balling in the mix 
Everything I done broke, Lil' Keke gon' fix 
I keep balling, balling in the mix 
Herschelwood click, and we so fucking thick 
  
[Duke] 
Well I'm a baller, dude Duke'll represent 
Can't count the kilos, of G's I sent 
From the corners and the cuts, for blocks and blocks 
I use to cut up rocks, now I pop the tops 
I gotta watch the cops, I got hoes by the flocks 
And Lil' Duke won't stop, until I'm sitting on top of the world 
On stacks, you know that's a fact 
Herschelwood through the front, the side and the back 
  
[Archie Lee] 
Well I'm a baller, sipping syrup alcoholer 
Throweder, slanging ki's G's hold up 
Roll deep, Sacci'd down with a fat sweet 
Ten G's, in the back of my Benzy 
Playa thang, like mary jane when I come around 
Mill tickets, being made in this H-Town 
Low rating niggaz hating, cause I'm pushing bricks 
Can't stand me, cause I'm rolling with a balling mix shit 
  
[Hook] 
Balling in the mix 
Everything I done broke, Lil' Keke gon' fix 
I keep on, balling in the mix 
Herschelwood click, and you hoes can't forget 
That we balling, balling in the mix 
Everything I done broke, Lil' Keke gon' fix 
I keep on, balling in the mix 
Herschelwood click, and you niggaz can't forget 
  
[Lil' Keke] 
Mean mugs get slugs, when you fucking with thugs 
I push and shove for ghetto love, afilliated with drugs 
And uh bark shit don't thrill me, haters wanna kill me 
Don't Mess Wit Texas, made the whole world feel me 
Now how many ballers, want em all like me 
And how many hoes, wanna fuck Lil' Ke 
Two or three naw black, cause it be more than that 
I'm sitting low sitting fat, green mats in the cat 
I grab my gat blood splat, while I'm throwing up busters 
Princess cut for a slut, bezeltyne in clusters 
Herschelwood it ain't over, mix the syrup and soda 
A 600 Benz, with a V-12 motor 
South Dakota to Carolina, a nationwide drug smuggler 
Rap game got me fame, low key and undercover 
No brother and nan other, will ever stand taller 
Southside representing, as a baller yeah 
  
[Hook] 
Balling in the mix 
Everything I done broke, Lil' Keke gon' fix 
I keep balling, balling in the mix 
I'm a pimp not a trick, hitting licks for my bricks 
Balling, balling in the mix 
Herschelwood click, and you niggaz can't forget 
That we balling, balling in the mix 
If you don't like my style, straight up suck my dick</pre>
