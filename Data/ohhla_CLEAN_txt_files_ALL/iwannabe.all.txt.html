[Intro: Allah Real]
I wanna believe, you gotta believe (6X)

[Allah Real]
The other day,  when I went outside I realized
You drive me crazy, got me thinking, another guy?
I've never beeen focused, but these feelings I have inside
The way I feel, I just wanna run and hide

[Chorus 2X: Allah Real]
I wanna believe, knowing what's right from wrong
I wanna believe, baby, what is going on?

[Allah Real]
This thing will past, cuz the love that burns inside
Now I understand, girl, I'm just an average guy
True love to be, that is worth me fighting for
I'm telling you, girl, I'm so in love with you

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 2X: Allah Real]
You, don't, know, what, I've, been through
All, my, thoughts spent --- on you

[Allah Real]
True love to be, that is worth me fighting for
I'm telling you, girl, I'm so in love with you

[Chorus + Hook to end] </pre>
