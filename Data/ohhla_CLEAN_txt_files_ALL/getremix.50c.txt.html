I get money, I get money, I get I get I get money (50)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)

I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (Yeah yeah)
money I got, money is got (I run New York!)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I take quarter water sold it in bottles for to bucks
Coca-Cola came and bought it;
for billions, what the fuck?
have a baby by me; baby
be a millionaire
I write the check before the baby comes
who the fuck cares
Im stanky rich
Ima die tryna spend this shit
Southside's up in in this bitch
Yeah I smell like the vault
I used to sell dope
I did play the block
now I play on boats
in the south of France
baby, St. Tropez
Get a tan? I'm already black
Rich? I'm already that
gangsta, get a gat
hit a head in a hat
call that a riddle rap
shit, fuck the chitter chat
I'm the baker, I bake the bread
the barber, I cut ya head
the marksman, I spray the lead
"I blood clot, chop ya leg"
do not fuck with the kid
I get biz wit the cigg
I come where you live
ya dig?

[Chorus]
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (Yeah)
money I got, money is got (I run New York!)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (Yeah yeah)
money I got, money is got (I run New York!)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Put the needle on the record
and the needle in your veins
If luda's on the record
it will never be the same
cause luda makes hits
and the rapes may claimed
I got the rates up but
aint a damn thang changed
Lets get one thang clear
souths right here
still got the Grammy
for the album of the year
12mils sold still flying on ????
over 30million dollars over
past three years
If I gets money money I got
the first in the hood with
a bentley drop tops
they take ghost tick
while the market goes tack
put the pedal down
as they say i'm on rocks
I get that cooperate
all twin property
only game I play
real like monopoly properly
And ain't no need for politics
sorry is and sorry does
follow me

[Chorus]
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (Yeah)
money I got, money is got (I run New York!)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (I I get it)
I get money, money is got (Yeah yeah)
money I got, money is got (I run New York!)

[Verse 3 + Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk
like a teflon Don, but I run New York
when I come outta court, yea I pop the Colt
I keep it gangsta, have ya outlined in chalk
I I get it
in the hood if ya ask about me
theyll tell ya I'm bout my bread
I I get it
round the world if ya ask about me
theyll tell ya they love the kid
I I get it
