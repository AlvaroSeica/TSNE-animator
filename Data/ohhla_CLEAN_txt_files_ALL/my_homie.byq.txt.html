[Intro]
Mmm mmm yo yo YO!!
Yo yo, yo yo yo yo
Wait my whole life, to do this motherfucker up
Yo yo yo weed and Courvoisier and shit
Yo yo, yo, uh-huh
Nigga been waiting to get a Alchemist beat
since I bought "1st Infantry" and shit, hehehe
Yo yo yo yo

[Chorus]
What's a real nigga addiction?
Money weed and bitches
Hangin with snitches
Shit it wasn't my intention

[ScHoolboy Q]
I didn't know; I knew him for years
Who would think his gums were soft
To all my niggaz I would die for
Load my pistol up go out and war for
Spend my last you keep yo' half we all poor
No way to go I'll walk you through my front door
My ninjas do the same
See when we was younger you was my mane, nigga
I wouldn't figure you would be on that stand
Puttin my life up in yo' hands
Pointing your finger like daaaaamn~! For really though?
We was just slingin oxy like a year ago
You knew my sister though, auntie cousins, and my uncle Joe
Cuz you hit my 'dro
See my nigga youse a ho; remember them Cheerios? (Yeah)
Ninja turtles on my grandmas floor
I'm like fo' sho' (Donatello) catch you on the rebound
You bound to drizzown, grave lounge where you sit down
What goes around comes arizzound, the sky's up
Inhale it slow, keep yo' mouth shut
Bet he won't tell no mo'

[Chorus]

[Interlude #1]
Bitch-ass nigga (fuck yo' ass comin from?)
Fo' sho'

[Chorus]

[Interlude #2]
Bitch-ass nigga (who the fuck you on the phone with?)
Awwwwww shit

[ScHoolboy Q]
Started around the bottom, ended up at the top
Heard you was in some trouble, I unretired my Glock
Did what I did, who woulda knew you was the cops?
Talkin all on the phone to your homies about a plots
Got me up in the box, thought that you was my nigga
You got your sentence reduced cause you told 'em I pulled the trigger
And I was lookin out for you! (YOU~!)
Tried to show him just how we do
Put all my shit aside and now I'm through
Figured that I would keep it Crippy this what this real nigga get me
Locked up for like a century while you get chances of a Bentley
Fuck, my old bitches while I beat my dick plenty
My shootin figure itchy, but I hope somebody get him
but probably not' shit I ain't sweatin it
Cuz got me hot, better get his ass popped
Can't get over how we was, tough as leather
Man we did everything together
Fucked our first bitches earned, our first cheddar
Robbed the first nigga was down, for whatever
And I'll blast 'til forever if we had too
But it's all cool

[Chorus] + [Interlude] #1 + Chorus + [Interlude #2]

[Outro]
Started around the bottom
Started around the bottom, ended up at the top {*2X*}
Don't let these niggaz know your plots
Wha-word, wha-word, word... Q!!</pre>
