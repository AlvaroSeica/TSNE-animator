I do not come in peace
I come ripped apart in several pieces
Allegiance to Jesus
A phoenix that reaches zenith within an
Astral fetus
Appear like this fearless
Released from the reaches of bitches
Who seek the riches that I burn
While I'm zealous
Fake lyricists left speechless
I greet as a genius
Reason with the street sense
Decrease them
Defeat demons and fiends of the beast
With the beats I unleash
From the streets of the east
Believe this
My seasons preach His Glory and Power
Sunshowers on towers
Bell sounds at each hour
Hate devour
Stage horrible battles like Kurosawa
Then study The Kaballah
Atop a mandala in Shambhala
Divine Arrival
My light is vital
Hostile, I willl strike you down as my rival
My mic is lightning
That God's Light ignites through
The squire of the Archangel Michael
The Fire of Life
True
I come with the fiery sword of the
Archangel Michael
And two other white dudes
Who don't like you
They'll fight you
I'm youthful
Saved and made brave in 7th grade
Trained in seven ways with Seven Angels who rage
Upon the plagues of snakes and fake ways who betrayed
Now lay slain in the range of the flame of my blade
I'm painful
I am the child born of light
Now my life is in Christ
Bring sight or blinding light
So choose right
Testify right
Shatter static
Black magic faggots panic
To battle's tragic
Avalanche advantage tactic
Hat trick like Joe Sakic
Me and Mattic attack savage and ravage your whack rapping
With rapid fire blasts that manage to gravitate rap to attics
Rap addicts like crack addicts
Act that lack passion
Whack wax we collapse
Trapped in a trash package
Systematic, my mic mathematics
Thrashes with damage
With tracked facts that react
Like a battle axe to your cap</pre>
