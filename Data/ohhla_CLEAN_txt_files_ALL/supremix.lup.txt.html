[Young Jeezy]
Lupe {*audience raving*}
Ha ha
Young

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Ah
Ah, ah, oh my God
All this for me, I must be on my job
First album was a classic, never got an award
Took my first ten grand and bought a Honda Accord
And then I pack them thangs inside the Honda Accord
And put them on a highway and watch the Honda Accord
Excuse me engineer, hope you pressing record
And on behalf of the streets, I just can't be ignored (YEAH!)
It's phasing all black (black) just like a new glock
All the broads screamin' like they just seen 2Pac
Say his earrings 'bout as big as his ego
Keep a fresh baldhead like he just left Kemo (AY!)
Yes, it ain't mine, this is Lupe's single
And every time I watch The Wire, it's like I just left B-More (HA HA!)
Call me Marlo, come be my Snoopy
Superstar, baby, why when you do me (YO!)

Chorus 1: Mathew Santos
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear
The camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna' know
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
You on your fiftheenth minute of fame and on the sixteenth
Beginith the lame, and on seventeen, you lose everythang
The twenty-first is the worse, wishin' you was eleven
Poppin' like you was seven with the feelin' when you was seconds
Reminiscin' when you was just in
Now you just ten, no longer the trend they dressin'
Now you wonderin' where all the press went
You no longer impress them
Get arrested, paparazzi will press then {*camera flash*}
I fell on purpose to stay a freshmen
I lose, but Lu attend the school for X-Men
So when I get my cap and gown and put the rappin' down
I'll only know half my powers, but I spend half an hour
Like a senior citizen, havin' a baby shower
Haters wanna budget, but my fans still love it
So you can ask them exactly who I are
Nine weeks in number one, I'm a superstar

Chorus 2: Mathew Santos
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear
The crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Okay now
Anyone who know me, they know me to ride
But when the shit was sellin' slow, it's just my homies and I
Had to get rid of all the phonies in the homies' disguise
So you speakin' and I don't reply, homie, don't be surprised
You ain't gotta ride for me, I ain't asked you to
Take a journey on my own, I would glad to do
You go and turn around, now, I call a cab for you
I stand up on my own two, he kissed a ass or who
No way, Jose, we pop Rose, blow dro, there's more, no case
But see, don't say my fault, ain't clip, more yay than Cirque Du Soleil
Cops is (???), all day, kill people and get off like O.J.
You catch your case, just shut your face, don't get caught singin' do-re
Mi-fa-se
La-ti-do, ghetto, he wrote G Code, I obey {*audience raving*}
He's so gaye
They handle them, he's hangin' 'round me, no way
It's okay
Life, listen, learn, I 'gest that you go your way
I be straight
No conversation, man, this all I'm gon' say
Hey

Repeat Chorus 1 &amp; 2

[Matthew Santos]
If you are
What you say you are
Then have no fear</pre>
