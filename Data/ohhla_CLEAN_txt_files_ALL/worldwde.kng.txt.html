[Intro: Timbo King]
My nigga Fifty Cent from Brooklyn, you heard?
Got CB4 little ass niggas out there.. (BLAP! Run back, niggas)
You running with a Brooklyn nigga... youknowhatimean?
Thorough like that (niggas know)
I ain't never seen the nigga come through the hood in Brooklyn..

[Chorus: Timbo King]
This is wrestling? What the fuck, this ain't no Smackdown
Oh you hustling, you sell crack, now?
Oscar Award nigga, oh, you act now?
I can't hear you, ya'll in the background
Come in the spot, ya'll all get pat down
Gats in your grill, now, go 'head and rap now
If not sit your punk ass back down
Them goons on the street, ready to attack now

[Timbo King]
Stop playing games, all ya'll lame niggas
Don't let Bo King start calling out names
Now the real Fifty Cent, got bodied, gun downed in the lobby
Murked off, so now you know, that Brooklyn bullshit, yea pa, I'm on it
Can't fuck with the Kingpin, you see me, you see a thousand men
The murderers, kill something, peel something, eat all ya'll food, nigga
Rude boys with automatic tools
Jumping out of coupes and hoops, it don't matter
As long as his head splatter, murda, murda, murda
Bloody, nigga, g's up, get that money nigga
Block muscle, do the hustle, like back in the days
Bitches like it when they platting my braids
Pimp juice, yeah, run in my veins, gangsta Brickface, nigga
The type of shit that get the papers, nigga...

"Oh my God, sounds like there's hip hop people out there!"

[Chorus]

[Timbo King]
Aiyo, four-five-six, now what, nigga c-lo
Ya'll get pushed out the way, get mushed out the way
The bank is mine, stop ya'll from playing
Now who wanna roll these? You scared, nigga?
Fuck-fuck police, I throw all threes
And talk, money, muthafuck your walking money
I'm keeping that, call me Bo King, bet that I four and better
Casino nigga, no, you can't see me, nigga
I'm nice with mines, these dices is mine
Now we can gamble til the sun come up, I let my son gun up
And put the drop on you, gangsta move
Yeah, I eat your Chinese food, beef or broccoli
Muthafucka that, yo the block is hot
Got grimey niggas ready by all means necessary
Don't you know hood legendary?
I was born on these streets, I was raised on these streets
I hustled on these streets, got stalked on these streets
Gun shots from new locks and mother gasp
You don't want Brooklyn on that ass, nigga
Yo, you don't want Brooklyn on that ass

[Chorus]</pre>
