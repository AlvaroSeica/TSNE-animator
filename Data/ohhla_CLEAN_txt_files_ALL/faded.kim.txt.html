[Chorus]
I got a feelin, a real good feelin
I'm gon' be faded
The bar is open, we just bought it
I'm gon' be faded
Let the champagne po-oh-oh-our
Po-oh-oh-our, po-oh-oh-our
Let the champagne po-oh-oh-our
Po-oh-oh-our, po-oh-oh-our

[talking over start over Chorus]
Ricky Rose', Red Cafe, Lil' Kim
Faded Remix, let's go Kimmy!

[Red Cafe]
Yeah, what else?
Damn I look good! Somebody take a photo
I runs my hizzouse, you can ask JoJo
Yank fitted on, my money on Jeter
My girls all dimes, Lou' Vuitton divas
I'm fly like an overnight letter
Shorty sleep with me make your overnights wetter
Better I'm faded (I'm faded)
And tonight I'm gon' get wasted
See to e'rybody listenin, it's on I'ma get it in
I can say whatever I'm a taxpayin citizen
Middle finger up, I don't got a conscience
I just go hard like the trio from Yonkers
Head honcho, kush in the console
Bad Boy, now they shook like Cosmo's
I'm all that, e'ry day all black
That Ciroc on deck, so I'm faded off that

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Yo, yo, yo yo
Bottles on me 'til the whole club faded
I'm in the V.I.P. and I'm white girl wasted
A rock star, party like Van Halen
Phantom come with a chaffeur so I don't valet it
Nah~! We celebrate, pour the Rose', let it flow
To a new year, new money and some extra O's
Let's toast to new cars, fly condos
IRS we the Celtics and I'm Rondos
Yeah bottles in the air like luggage and jet cargos
We keep the champagne comin 'til the bar closed
These S1's keep the Dom on chill
I just blew 50 like a shady deal
I'm faded, me and my peoples we wasted
Yeah, yeah
Mo' bottles in the V's, cookin up mo' cheese
Got a feeling it's gon' be a good night like Black Eyed Peas

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Yeah, it's Ricky Rose', yeah
Let me slide on 'em homey
It go like this
Two homes on the block, each one mill'
And this ring on my finger is a +E One+ deal
Canary yellow stone, cain't be faded
Fatigue bell 45 made for the Navy
Y'all niggaz ready to grapple down your building
I'm livin chillin, arms wrapped around a Brazilian
In the presence of a Don be cautious but calm
Cain't be faded, two pills, a charm
She licks on my chest, readin tats on my arm
Hit her from the back same time her mind blown
Speechless, so she scream in silence
A real bad boy and all my speeches violent

[Chorus]</pre>
