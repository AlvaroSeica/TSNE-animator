[Phonte]
Rewind - I'm thinking back to all the good days
Don't wanna go, I wish I could stay
Cause girl you the truth
In time, I'll be your lover make you want more
You say I'm everything you longed for
Now show me the proof, hey

[Chorus]
Show me the place where I belong
And show me a love that I can feel
Tell me you'll stay by my side for a life, not just a moment
Show me the place where I belong
And show me a love I know is real
Tell me you'll stay by my side for all time, not just a moment

[Phonte]
Rewind - I'm thinking back to our first date
Just had to have you in the worst way
Cause girl you the truth.. and there's so much to do
Nothing to lose, just show and prove

[Chorus]

[Phonte]
Rewind - I'm thinking back on all the good days
Don't wanna go, I wish I could stay
Cause girl you the truth... And there's so much to do
Nothing to lose, what's your excuse?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(I belong, I belong, I belong, I belong) Not just a moment {2X}
(I belong, I belong, I belong, I belong) {2X}</pre>
