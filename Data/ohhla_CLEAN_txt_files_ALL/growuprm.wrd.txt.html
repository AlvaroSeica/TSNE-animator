Dont take this too seriously 
I'm doing it for a laugh cunt man
Auld Reekie 

Whos that
The wee Scottish rapper
Aw not you no clue cue laughter
Ha ha ha your ma ha ha
I do what I want cunt fucking rah
I couldn't rhyme with that
So I just made a noise went rah like that
Im raw like that so fall right back
Who you talking to cunt oh no right bat
Ah shit Werds gone crazy
Punch lines cheesy mainstream maybe
Yeah I'm white but I'm not shady
Dont do it Big like baby baby
Kick in the door
No its just police
Just work for pennies
And I'm not Polish
I just note this they dont notice
They just want to hear a bitch on the chorus

[Werd]
Ok Werds back again
And I'm not going to stop until I'm coping the Benz
Rocking the boat rock till the end
Got no guitar but a rock this ken
Mental instrumental at bringing that fire to instrumentals
A swear its not general check my credentials
Aw shit a burnt up the pencil
And the page and my hand and the table
Truthfully cunt I am unstable
Get the horse play back to the stable
Its nae bother hook up the cable
I rock rock like hard candy
And my jaw pops like I just copped MDA
I can can kick like you canny
Still trying to sell in the shops that I'm banned fae

[Werd]
When I grow up I want to be a doctor
No wait I want to be a lawyer
In fact that what your mum chooses for you
When I grow up I want to be a foot balla
But I dont play
I dont wear shorts
See I think thats gay
But I play the field and hit my goals
Swing clubs hit green and I get my hole
Like golf yeah
So lets drive on
I spit fire and I drag on
And on and on and on and on
But you dont like it but its my song
Yeah yeah so a wont pretend
I came for the fame not to make friends
Mixtape coming yip this fall
Am blowing up bitch I dont mean sex dolls
