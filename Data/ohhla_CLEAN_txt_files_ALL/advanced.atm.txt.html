It's always good to have that extra reinforcement...
Looking forward to it (Very much so)
Looking forward to it (Very much so)
Looking forward to it (Very much so)
Take my hand (Advanced communications)
Take my hand (Advanced communications)
Take my hand (Advanced communications)

The candles flicker, you handle your liquor
The nerves quiver, wish my band had some stickers that I could give ya
Blistered, from a, endless list of complaints
Tainted, consumed, fainted in a room full of paint fumes
Fell naked, but tell me how far can I take it
Ingrained in my brain, hold the pain like it's sacred
Snow fall covers all, that's immobile
I try to bring the plow, but it tends to come out boastful
Kill the sayer-hatin', and kill the flavor-fakin'
Partake in that forsaken game, FUCK YOU and your neighbor's sake
Now waken (*Beat slows down*)
The early bird apprehends the circuit
Gotta catch the train, ma, gonna join the circus
(*Beat changes*)

[Chorus: Slug] (Repeat 2x)
Call it love, call it skill, call it what you will, 
I don't give a fuck just call us up so we can build

[Slug]
Yo, I got your interest, pessimistic, guinea swined
Over exerted emotion to he point of feeling fine
Inner mind travel: when I awoke, the feet hurt
Scared to drive, scared to fly
I wrote the speaker wired
When the rival is desired
I'm smiling at the fire 
that's contrived in and inspired in the eyes of desire
When it cries, "Take me higher!"
I look across the globe and fantasize of what's dope and drop my low
Set baby, with the head gravy
Better get lazy, cause if you step, you get wrecked baby
Yet maybe I should feed'em line like trout
Put my rhymes in they mouth, that's what I'm about
Truth be told not from the new or the old
I'm from the now watch me while I make your whole crew explode
Super nova style, hold your pin to the mat
From the grin to the chin to the limbs to the back
In a fist full of steel I express how I feel
Blinded by work searching for the best kind of deal
Gotta find the angle in a circle of hopeful
Apply a choke hold and set the locals running in ovals

[Chorus: Slug] (Repeat 4x)
Call it love, call it skill, call it what you will
I don't give a fuck just call us up so we can build

Sluggo!
Yeah, this is Aaron
Umm, newel, I mean, I mean, yeah
I mean, like uhh, I don't have anything in the mail yet, man
And I'm like, eager to do my verse again and stuff because
because I've been taking testosterone pills
Umm...so like, hi
Where is it? Give me a call
And, uhh, if you caught me last weekend on your phone from my cell, umm, yeah 
I was kinda, piss loaded drunk and stuff, and I can't even remember what I said
But my girlfriend had to remind I called you
Anyways, nifty huh?
Peace out, honkey, bye-bye
