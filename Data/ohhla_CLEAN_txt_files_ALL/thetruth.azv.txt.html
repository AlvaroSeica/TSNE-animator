[AZ]
It's the most marvelous
Haha, so consistent, so Denevere
This here is classical
I'm a genius!
Allow me...

[Verse 1]
Scrilla rap spitter, silverback gorilla, mass killer
Heavy hoodie cow, hide, half chinchilla
Watch for scrilla's cuz they hastle the dealers, for reala
Y'all little niggaz, me I lex and grilla, I'm chilla
Pillows of purple had to seal up my circle
It's serious, when your seralbello senses alert you
Pollack church shoes parolee homie's home on curfew
Who's commercial, I verbalize universal
Uniqueness, I'm nonchalant nigga no secrets
What ambiance never show weakness, control leakege
Live niggaz know I speak it
Verbalize outta eye, cuz we cohesive
Flow's freakish
Dough is just honor the pieces to the puzzle
Like the streets always been to the struggle

[Chorus]
I am the truth, truth
On a whole nother level
From the stone to the bezel
To the chrome on the metal
I zone for the ghetto's (Huh! Huh!)
I am the truth, truth
Every coast gotta know
I'm the most with the flow
No joke I'm a pro
I'm like the pope on the low

[Verse 2]
Soul music so intense so live
It's, no excuses y'all been so deprived
This is so exclusive and I'm so obliged
Certified superhero with no disguise
Force the vibe for the niggaz got tossed aside
and the misfortuned that lost they lives
I survive, I weave from side to side
No when to slide, stay hush, use my eyes to guide
I'm straight up
Too tough try hide my pride
Grew up amongst sky high homocide
Who am I besides homie that exposed to phoneys
The one and only still intact without the matrimony
Still on track I cock back and, black like Toby
Y'all bastards know me, no wolfpack attack for doly

[Chorus]
I am the truth, truth
On a whole nother level
From the stone to the bezel
To the chrome on the metal
I zone for the ghetto's (Huh! Huh!)
I am the truth, truth
Every coast gotta know
I'm the most with the flow
No joke I'm a pro
I'm like the pope on the low

[Hook]
Certified murder ties
Been in beef, burglarise
Been a beast, purchased pies
Hell heat, perfect size
Felt defeat, felt the rise
Seldom sleep, dealt with lies
Been Tel-Aviv through certain rides
Smelt police, I works with high

[Verse 3]
Hood legend, household name
Presence is felt, real niggaz vouch for my pain
Ahead of myself, what else is there about this game
The letters is spelt, so know when he drouch the same
Measure my wealth with realness, I know what's good
No mills missed, keep one foot in the hood
I still spit like a lot of niggaz wish they would
Can sell shit till I'm stiffed and shipped in wood
Misunderstood, mama's only son she's stressed to get it done
She knows I'm the last one left

[Chorus]
I am the truth, truth
On a whole nother level
From the stone to the bezel
To the chrome on the metal
I zone for the ghetto's (Huh! Huh!)
I am the truth, truth
Every coast gotta know
I'm the most with the flow
No joke I'm a pro
I'm like the pope on the low</pre>
