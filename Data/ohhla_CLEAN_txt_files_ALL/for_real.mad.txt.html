[Verse 1 - Skillz]
I remember that day like yesterday (yeah)
When I first saw baby girl around the way
But the guy that she with can't be her man (yeah)
Cause if she was my girl, I'd be holdin her hand (come on)
So I just stared at her and held my spot (yeah)
Thinkin damn this man don't know what he got (uh)
She was way pass hot, then she flashed me a grin (yeah)
So that means she wish she wasn't with him (come on)
So I, played it smooth and I winked at her gladly (yeah)
Hey, is it me or she just wink back at me?
Now I ain't sayin that dude don't matter (yeah)
But should I feel bad, cause I really wanna have her? (come on)
She was more than just a pretty face (yeah)
Oh well, maybe another time, another place (uh)
Until then you already know the deal (yeah)

[Chorus - Kristal] - w/ ad libs
But he don't own me for real
(For real) for real
(For real) for reeeeal
(No, he don't own me)
But he don't own me for real
(For real) for real
(For real) for reeeeal
(He don't own me)
No, he don't own me for real

[Verse 2 - Skillz]
Wow! This feels so st

And I didn't even get your name
You make me wanna sing about ya (yeah)
I mean you a queen, so you need a king around ya (come on)
He probably thinkin, be safe, be sure (be sure) (yeah)
You ain't married little momma, what you waitin for? (uh)
Maybe he holdin steady (yeah)
Or maybe he gon' do it when he get ready (come on, uh)
I ain't plottin, for you to drop him (yeah)
I'm just sayin, exercise your options (uh)
Until then, you already know the deal (yeah)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Break - Kristal] (Skillz)
{She said}
He just fillin up space {okay}
Waitin for you to take his place {alright}
Cause ain't no rings on my finger
Really it ain't that serious {okay}
No, that's just part of the game {hmm}
Really I ain't his girl to claim
Tell me what's your name?
{Nice to meet you, my name is Skillz}
