[Chorus: Flo Rida, Ke$ha - sung to "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
   You spin my head right round, right round
   When you go down, when you go down down

[Flo Rida - Verse 1ne]
Heeeey! Rock out of the house with my swagger
Hop in, there we go, I got places to GO!
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta con-TROL!
Just like my mind where I'm goin
No women, no shorties, no nothin but CLOTHES!
No stoppin now, my Pirellis on (roll)
I like my jewlrey that's always on (froze)
I know the storm is comin
My pockets keep tellin me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies that's home
Then pop in the night 'cause it's meant to be ours
We keep a fadeaway shot 
'cause we be ballin, it's platinum Patr√≥n that be ours
Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you the truth with all of that goody power 'cause...

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida - Interlude Repeat 2X]
From the top of the pole I watch her go (down)
She got me throwin my money a- (round)
Ain't nothin more beautiful to be (found)
...it's goin down down!

[Flo Rida - Verse 2wo]
Heeeey! Shawty must know I'm the man
My money love her like a number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my bands
My Benjamin Frank-i-lins
A couple of grands, I got rubberbands
My paper planes makin her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my (plans)
We buildin castles that's made out of sand
She's amazin, her fire blazin
Hotter than cajun; girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is wavin at me, like damnit I told ya
Doin a show like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur 'cause...

[Chorus + Interlude 2X]

[Flo Rida - Bridge]
Yeeeah! I'm feelin my money (EY!)
I'm outta control (EY!)
Somebody help me
She's takin my bank, roll
But I'm king of the club
And I'm wearin the crown
Poppin these bottles, touchin these models
Watchin they asses go {down Down DOWN}

{DOWN...DOWN...DOWN...DOWN...DOWN...DOWN}
