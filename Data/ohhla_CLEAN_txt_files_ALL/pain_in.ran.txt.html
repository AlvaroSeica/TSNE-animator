[ VERSE 1: Random ]
Hey yo, we met when I was 11, new girl on the block
Foreign exchange student that didn't really talk
She came from Japan and barely knew the language
But within a week I learned that she was cool to hang with
And she was cute, knew how to have fun
And so my biggest crush had officially begun
Adrenaline junkies, so we stayed in somethin
Runnin and jumpin, even duck huntin
Met with her after school every day faithfully
She was never too busy, always played with me
And yeah, we built up trust over time
Told me her biggest secrets and I told her mine
And mom started worryin 'bout the time we spent
I told her I was in love, she juggled a bit
And said, "Please, next weekend it'll be someone else"
But she just didn't understand the love we felt
Oh

(And night and day has began to get tough
Said I won't you to come back, come back, come back, baby
I've had enough) --&gt; Otis Redding

Needed to concentrate to get my degree
And so we broke up, I knew I had to set her free
And if it was meant to be, then I would be sure
She wanted to be a model but she was still immature
I dated others but they never compared
She was ( ? ) but I couldn't tell her I was missin her
Went to the block and heard some real bad news
They said she was on the pipe and started doin shrooms
Called her old news since the new girls came
Tried to talk to her, it just wasn't the same
Cause she was unresponsive, they called her trash
And said, "You can get her for cheap if you out on the ave"
I was devastated, so when I came back home
I tried to find her, mama said that she was long gone
I feel like it's my fault for not playin my part
Now I'm sittin in my dorm with this pain in my heart
I can't take it

(And night and day has began to get tough
Said I won't you to come back, come back, come back, baby
I've had enough)

[ VERSE 3: Random ]
One day about six years later
I was in a Starbucks and saw her face in the paper
And though I couldn't date her I would try to emulate her
But it wasn't the same flavor I used to savor
I thought of all the long nights, thought of all the memories
Figured I would call her, see if she remembered me
And she did, suggest that we should meet up
I was with somebody else, but I wanted to see her
And she was still pretty after all she went through
Life was better, so she asked what I was into
Full-time teacher, full-time musician
Gave her a CD so she could take a listen
She did, told me she loved what she heard
But asked why I never made a song about her
And that night I took her home and hit reset
Pain in my heart left, we together till the death
Yes

(A little pain in my heart just won't let me be)
That's what I told her 'bout, all the pain I was feelin
(Wake up at restless nights, Lord, and I can't even sleep)
We back, better than ever, baby

Yeah
There's nothin like a clich√© metaphorical rap song to get you thinkin a little bit
