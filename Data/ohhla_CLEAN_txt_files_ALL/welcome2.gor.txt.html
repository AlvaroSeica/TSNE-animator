[Snoop Dogg]
Gorillaz and the boss Dogg
Planet of the apes

(*Instrumental until 1:19*)

[Snoop Dogg]
The revolution will be televised..
And the pollution from the ocean,
now with devotion..
Push peace and keep it in motion...
Kids, gather around, yeah, I need your focus..
I know it seems like the world is so hopeless..
It's like Wonderland..

Now fascinate me
Picture and animate me
Cause I'm rollin', deep holein'
Click clacking, crack-a-lacking
Full packing (Hey!), mo' stacking
Acting a fool when I teach
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach..
Mirror mirror on the wall
Boss Dogg, give it to 'em, get involved
Turn it up, speed it up
Slow it up, underground where the under us undercut
Shipped up, shipped out, swimmin' with the sharks put my gills up
Turn the wheels up real tough
Drinkin' lemonade in the shade
Getting blade with a gang of pilgrims..
Yeah, just like that
Belly floppin' lockin' while I'm rockin' in the bubble bath
And I'm just like math
Fozo's added up that get you more cash
So quick, so fast
All the kids say they love it when I make 'em laugh..

Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach, yeah
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach</pre>
