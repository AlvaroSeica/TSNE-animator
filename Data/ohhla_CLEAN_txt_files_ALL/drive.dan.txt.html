INTRO (Dan-e-o &amp; Brotha J):
Whoo! You crazy with it Skizz!
Ha! Yeah!
Oooh! Yeah, yeah!

VERSE ONE (Dan-e-o):
One time for my people on the west coast
I'm goin' national, I used to be the Expos
I ain't regular, SNL guest host
Rhymes, keep 'em sharp like I dress 'em in my best clothes
"Hey, I love him!" is what the ladies say
A fat man at a barbeque, I raise the stakes
DJ's bun pay for play
Take a chance, it ain't Gordon Gartrell but rock it anyway
Devious to your diaspora
Raps I Drew Barrymore niggaz than you, call me "Firestarter"
Guy you oughta know that I'm from a higher order
Basically, I reign like I'm Richard Pryor's daughter
You ain't know? there's a problem with you
You called me a "pitcher's arm", 'cause you thought I was through
Hip-hop, I got locked like it's part of a zoo
And there's a brand new dance that I want you to do
It's called...

CHORUS (Dan-e-o):
Drive! Put your hand out in front
Like you got the steering wheel as the system bump
and just Drive! Side to side, to and fro
If you was driving for real, you would crash for sho'
But just Drive! Don't forget to recline
Lean back, head bop, put a wave in your spine 
And just Drive! Do it just like that
Now it's time to make your hands clap
(Clap, clap)

VERSE TWO (Dan-e-o):
Two times for my people on the east side
Skizzy, you a beast how you let this beat ride
Smoking these clowns like a peace pipe
Rhymes bad for their health, got niggaz thinkin' they deep fried
Some wonder why I be so extreme
But I'll be blowing steam 'til I roll in cream like I'm Kobe Bean
Droppin' the heaviest shit, it'd make a colon scream
I put a nigga in his place like I coach his team
On top, where else do you think my head is at?
But what you said is wack, softer than a feathered hat
YouTube gangsta, please never that!
I'm here for life, y'all niggaz fade like a Henna tat
Bye, adios amigo, you're old news
Cotton candy ass rappers, this is soul food
Takin' care of you kids, 'cause I'm supposed to
And there's a brand new dance I wanna show you

CHORUS (Dan-e-o):
Drive! Put your hand out in front
Like you got the steering wheel as the system bump
and just Drive! Side to side, to and fro
If you was driving for real, you would crash for sho'
But just Drive! Don't forget to recline
Lean back, head bop, put a wave in your spine 
And just Drive! Do it just like that
Now it's time to make your hands clap
(Clap, clap)

BRIDGE (Brotha J):
Whether you driving a Lexus, 
A Beamer or some Benz
It don't matter what you in,
It's what you imagine
Yeah, ain't nothing to it
Anyone can do it
Just lay back, recline 
And drive...

VERSE THREE (Dan-e-o):
Three times for everyone in this vast land
Who can't believe that Dan came funky like Gap Band
In a fast span, I deal with jokers like Batman
'Cause you know what's up, I see through you like a cat scan
It's time a real player handle the ball
I write to erase your name like a vandal's assault
Admit, to me you can't hold a candle, it falls
Like me revealing this dance ain't brand new at all
But just...

CHORUS (Dan-e-o):
Drive! Put your hand out in front
Like you got the steering wheel as the system bump
and just Drive! Side to side, to and fro
If you was driving for real, you would crash for sho'
But just Drive! Don't forget to recline
Lean back, head bop, put a wave in your spine 
And just Drive! Do it just like that
Now it's time to make your hands clap
(Clap, clap)
Now it's time to make your hands clap
(Clap, clap)
Now it's time to make your hands clap
(Clap, clap)

OUTRO (Dan-e-o):
Oooh! We just too funky for 'em Skizz!
I know they wasn't expecting this joint man (haha!)
Yes Brotha J! Whoo!
Keep driving baby, uh, keep driving baby
Yeah, uh
We keep driving baby, yeah we keep driving baby
Whoo! Ha!</pre>
