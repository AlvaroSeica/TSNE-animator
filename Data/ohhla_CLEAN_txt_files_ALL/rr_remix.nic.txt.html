[Intro: Sample courtesy of "Scenario" by A Tribe Called Quest &amp; Leaders Of The New School]
As I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Busta Rhymes]
The streets been tellin me to get on the remix right?!!!!
Heh heh ha ha ha ha ha ha!!! Let's get it!!!

[Verse One: Nicki Minaj]
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin
I'm startin to feel like a dungeon dragon
RAHHH RAHHH, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzin 
So fuck I look like gettin back to a has-been?
Yeah I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flat screen
Ha ha... plasma
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki!" Asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars.. sentencin
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that hoe, punt!
Forced trauma.. blunt
You play the back, bitch I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin it
Nicki Minaj, is who you ain't fuckin with
You lil' braggart I'll beat you with a padded lock
I am a movie, camera block
You out of work, I know it's tough
... But enough is enough

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon 
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Busta Rhymes - over Chorus]
Aiyyo somebody go get a theromostat and check my temperature
I feel like a got a fever in this muh'fucker!!!!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!

[Verse Two: Busta Rhymes]
Nicki!!! How you 'gon take my hot line and make it a hot song?!
Like I ain't 'posed to come and step on this shit like King Kong!!!
See as a child I was born with a old soul
See I would breathe heavy flame would shoot out of my nose hole
HAAAAAAAA RRRAAHHHHHH!!! Too much shitty diapers
Love to play with matchers and drink all the fluid out of lighters
From when I was a child I know that most of y'all was triddash
I dig in my nose and wipe the biggest BOOGA on your bitch asssssss!!!!
Usin your head like fuck what the Lord said
Slightly demented with a permanent wrinkle in my forehead
Boar's Head beef bitch if you want it then peep lane
Mudrer niggas with the fire then bounce to a Heat game
Tie you up like bikes to a rail in with a little cheap chain
And I'll comfortably hang you from the side of the buildin
So niggas see your bitch ass is LAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMEEEE!!!!
"Aiyyo what you cut it off for? Don't you see what I'm doin to this?!"
'Posed to know how I'm directin these flicks
The question everywhere is you gettin on the remix? (DAMN RIGHT!!!)
'Cause this is somethin that I fathered and mastered 
And plastered 'til they started callin me sick bastard
I'm drastic when it comes to remindin niggas who's responsible for the classics
And I burn a hole in the street like my liver was acid
Everytime I jump on the beat see the shit will get drastic
while your gettin yo' ass kicked
Like a kick and a punch slap and two chops
Kinda like pong ping baduf baf beat him until he diggity 2Pac
Mi broke mi ting leave a few match 
Rope him and then drag him a few blocks (HORRIBLE)
Uh! Uh! Uh! The muscle of the street (MOVE BITCH)
Pardon me UH! Shufflin the beat nigga!!!
UH! Take a elbow, I'm scufflin to eat
Like a nigga that was grindin and was hustlin for weeks
So I rushed and rushed, then I blacked
Then I came through and I gave the streets crack
Controllin the functions throughout the steer
EVERYBODY PUT YOUR MOTHERFUCKIN HANDS IN THE AIR!!! (That's how I do 'em)
I do the type of shit that niggas can't imagine (Uh Huh!)
You know I'm one of the nicest and I ain't braggin (Uh Huh!)
I make 'em all surrender 'til they see white flags
And they recognize I'm the original dungeon dragon (OK!)
RRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon
Change your shitty drawers cause your pants are saggin
Try to step to this and I'll twist you to a turban
And have you smellin ripe, like some old stale urine
GONE!!!!

[Chorus]</pre>
