Verse One: Lone Ninja

Superhuman bow to aura, doom is looming round the corner
house  of horrors, you will lose in bout with brawler    
proud to offer my services the mercenary
the prowling stalker whose purpose is to hurt and bury   
knives hurled thrown in cold tomb
in my world there is no spoon            
From school of mutants Slew with brute strength
the new recruit, the mood too tense           
Use acute sense, telepathic ability
shooting through fence then I capture the enemy       
I chase prey down the tall hill
My brain waves shatter force fields              
more skilled, when I blast hit you blam
swords kill, you're the sacrificial lamb         
You awestruck from the ninja's whole style
applause erupts for the indigo child   

Verse Two: June Marx

Pseudo scientific, brutal and explicit
Unusual and gifted, refuse to be restricted
Born before dust took form and the first human existed
Proof of the lineage, computers diminished
Elusive and vivid, parapsychologists
Study usage of lyrics decipher the opposites
No fool is permitted, i inspire the populace
Hold truth from the wicked, rewire your consciousness
Mind processes,indigo children ,critical wisdom
Beyond limits of peripheral vision
My visual different, recognize earth, fire water and wind
In its original condition
Unparalleled intuition, channel my existence
Despite scandals of religion
The math is forbidden perils let the plasma flow
Craft will show that we way above status quo</pre>
