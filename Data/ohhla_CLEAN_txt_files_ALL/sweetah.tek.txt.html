[Intro: Tekitha]
Sweetah love, sweet love
Sweetah love, sweet love

[Chorus: Tekitha]
Sweetah love, oh so far away (sweetah love, my sweet baby)
Sweetah love, oh so far, away (away) away

[Tekitha]
Waited out, it took so long for your sweet sound
Love pound, love tomorrow, mind goes where I browse
Dreamin' away, I stand still in the mist of you
What more can I do? Do
Time in this misery, long to be rid of
Traveled far and beyond for springs of your love
Dreamin' away, I stand still in the mist of you
What more can I do?

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Tekitha]
Away, how I love my baby
Love my baby

[Tekitha]
All in my room and I cry, take attention
One thought of you, and my heart it feels special
Love feels so good, now I see what you mean to me
No longer a hard age dream
And I can't tell you, how much you sound sets me free
When you come closer to in me, surroundin' see, me
Sweetah, sweetah, love, the boy controllin' me
Music you are inside, outside, throughout, freely, yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro: Tekitha]
Away, never leave you, sweetah love
I'll always be your love
Trapped in this misery, alone to be with you</pre>
