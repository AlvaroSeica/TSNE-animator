[Intro]
The time has come...for bad things to leave
The time has come...for right to begin
The time has come...for the war of the gods

Yes..

It's that time
I'ma take the subtle approach first
Cause I'm just gettin started
Let's go

[1st Verse]
Look, I'm the best and there's nothing that you can do about it
Never needed a publicity stunt, let's tell the truth about it
Even in the core of the streets, you can't sway the youth about it
But keep runnin yo mouth, and I swear I'ma knock a tooth up out it
I never claimed to be nuthin but who the fuck I am
Never sold cocaine in my life, but I'm still the fuckin man
Understand, nuthin you did makes you better nigga
You claim the streets, but the streets respect that chedda nigga
Luda got twice as much yo life you can charge it to 'em
I fit four of your houses inside my daughters room
And still have room for young Karma to play
Givin back to the children of tommorrow, for good karma today
So you can say whatcha wanna say, and you can talk that talk
But real niggaz ain't doin no talkin cause we walk that walk
Album for album you can see I got a multimillion plan
So call yourself whatever you want cept the multimillion man

[Chorus: Ludacris over woman singing]
Whatever you want except the multi-million man, nigga
Call yourself whatever you want except the million man, nigga (2X)
(How many, man)

[2nd Verse]
How many times is you gon rap about busting your gun
How many times is you gon trap without busting your gun
Only shots you ever took were subliminal to the general
Disrespectin those doin real time with real criminals
And I ain't never did a day in my life
But it should be illegal to walk a day in my life
I paid the price and the cost to be the boss so you can rest your mouth
I'm universal, Luda never limits himself to the south
I give a damn about ya hootin and hollerin, and it ain't botherin ME
I hear you talkin but you ain't made it to THREE
You know where I live, but you ain't made it to ME
You ain't made nigga
I'm havin a house party, kid come get played nigga
You got played, my record label never jerked me
So shoot me, stab me, but words will never hurt me
I feed off your energy, my powers with God
So it's even better if you make ya diss record real hard...

[Chorus: Ludacris over woman singing]
Make the record real hard (2X)
Ya diss record real hard

[3rd Verse]
See even without all that bass and treble, I'm as hot as the devil
But I work for the top floor, homie get on my level
I'm being stripped away of powers because I gave you my blessing
So it'll take more than majority vote to win this election
Man, mixtapes are not my resume, it's too hot
And I warned them I was coming, I got that number 1 spot
So unless you using tampons, quit acting stuck up
And do like your records say, or shut the FUCK up

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Do like your records say, or shut the fuck up (2X)
Shut the fuck up</pre>
