Children Chorus:
Who's that man that's got that song
That's bumpin' on the radio
You know
U-N-O
You know
U-N-O
S.I.C.K.O.
And Sicko is his name-o

[Mr. Lil' One]
(Verse 1)
I been waitin' for this moment, and finally, it's here
The monster of the dawn, Lil' Uno reappear
Come on over here, bring along all your peers
Holla at a player, put "Flava In Ya Ear"
Yeah
Party all night til the morn' time
Right before I leave, I do this one more time
So so fine, little mama's on mine
So fresh, so clean, never small time
And where the players at, holla at ya boy, One
Little bodies in the back, come and get some
I'm a lay back, cheer for the old school
See, I do what I do, cause I'm 'posed to

Hook: Mr. Lil' One
Who's, that
Pumpin' in the back
Who's, that
Pumpin' in the front
Who's, that
Who doin' so classic
All around the world, man, everybody askin'

Repeat Children Chorus

(Verse 2)
Soon as I walk in the club, everybody like "Damn!"
Everybody and they mom wanna grab me by the hand
Say
Ain't nothin' special, I'm just one of the greats
And your time will come soon, you just patiently wait
Hey
I'm the first and the last, all day
I came here to do this, here, my way
I'm a legend like Chente, classic like 'Pac
Can't take what I got, see, it's naturally top
Hun
And my love for the street's so grimey
Come from the heart, baby boy, don't try me
I put a smile on your face, little sunshine
A little love, every one, but they're on time

Repeat Hook

Repeat Children Chorus

(Verse 3)
[Lil' Uno] Ain't no need to be dramatic, we're on top of the line
           I put that chill in your spine, while he still on his prime
           And that's fine
           Yeah, you just speak it how you want, though
           Triple O.G., I been doin' it for so long
           And I'm just so difficult to deal with
           Ain't too many left I can keep it real with
           So I kick it like this cause I had to
[Samoan]   Somebody gotta bring it back
[Lil' Uno] Well, I'd be glad to
           Excelente, screamin' for an encore
           I can't stop, man, the whole world want more
           So loud, crowd boogie to the beat, now
           It's the Boogieman, 'bout to bring the heat now

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

Break: Mr. Lil' One
Now everybody say, "Hey"
Now everybody say, "What"
And all the ladies say, "Hey"
And all the fellas say, "Hey"

Repeat Chorus

[Mr. Lil' One]
Yeah

We ain't going nowhere
I see you, Fingazz
Ha ha ha
