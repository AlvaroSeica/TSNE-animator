[Intro: Timbaland]
Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't don't don't hold the wall
Dance dance, don't hold the wall
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall

[Justin Timberlake]
Come on the floor with them legs, was gettin down but I'll get up
Cause I heard you tell your girlfriend that I deserve better
Hm, well... I think you look better
But you're so far I had to come get ya

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Take you to the light, it's dark in the back
You started movin you put an arch in your back
Closer to me, closer to me
Sippin your drink and you're gettin closer to me
Dance in the light, startin to see
You started movin you're gettin closer to me
And now you won't even let me go-ohhhh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake] + (Timbaland)
So baby hold up - ooh
Dance, don't hold the wall
Don't let go - ooh
Dance (don't don't) don't hold the wall
Baby hold up - ooh
Dance (dance) don't hold the wall
Don't let go - ooh
Dance (da-da-dance) don't hold the wall
Ooh (dance) {"What you do to me? Oooh"}
Ooh (dance, don't don't don't hold the wall)
Ooh (dance dance) {"What you do to me? Oooh"}
Ooh (da-da-dance, don't hold the wall)

[Timbaland]
Dance dance, don't hold the wall
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall

[Justin Timberlake]
I think I heard what you said, he's not what you thought and you're fed up
I heard your girlfriend tell you, you could do better
Well, hm... I'm the best ever
But you're so far I had to come get ya

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Justin Timberlake]
Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't hold the wall...
