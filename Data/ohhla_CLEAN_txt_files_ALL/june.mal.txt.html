[Intro: Frank Sinatra sample]
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
That's life

[Chorus: Frank Sinatra sample] (Eric David)
That's life (That's liiiife!)
That's what all the people say
You're riding high in April
And shot down in May
I said that's life (That's liiiife!)
And as ugly as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stomping on your dreams
I said that's life

[No Malice]
Just the other day I'm ridin on my high horse
Custom leather seats in the Porsche to die for
The jewels alone made him sick, I am an eyesore
They couldn't see me like Stevie, +My Cherie Amour+
was three or four baddest of my women friend
One in the front, two in the back of the latest Benz
Rims spinnin, tires Pirelli
+Happy Days+, I'm Fonzerelli
What you gon' tell me, am I not the realest?
Thousand dollar bottles, just so I can spill it
In the VIP, standin on the couches
Talkin cash shh.. cause my money's where my mouth is

[Chorus]

[No Malice]
Ain't nothin like havin that rug pulled from under you
They kick you when you down, no one gives a number two
Down but not out, so you should never snooze
Cause the dude who's at rock bottom ain't got nothin to lose
If you know who you are, you ain't got nothin to prove
Cause to me, red bottoms ain't nothin but shoes
Win, lose, or draw, I'm workin on these flaws
I just wish chicks would stop, throwin me they draws
Judas kisses, lying to the Mrs.
Racin to hit the street, lookin for my mistress
Now look at me, lookin for forgiveness
for tryin to put my thang where I ain't got no business

[Chorus]

[Outro: No Malice]
What goes around comes around
What goes up must go down
I said, what goes around comes around
What goes up must go down
I said, what goes around comes around
What goes up must go down
I said, what goes around comes around
What goes up must go down</pre>
