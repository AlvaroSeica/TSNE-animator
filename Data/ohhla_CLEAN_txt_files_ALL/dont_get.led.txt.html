[Intro: Ace Hood]
Y'all don't want to get me started hoe
You don't want to get me started hoe
Ace Hood! (Ace Hood)
{We the Best, Y.M.C.M.B.}

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
My nigga fuck what you say, my niggaz out for the cake
Was on the block every night, was on the block e'ry day
I do this shit for my fam, you do this shit for the fame
I kept it real from the joint, and that's just how I remain
Don't get me started, don't get me started
My nigga, my nigga don't get me started, don't get me started
My niggaz go real as they go so hard, so dumb retarded
Cause a nigga wanna think it's sweet then try me
Don't get me started, don't get me started

[Ace Hood]
Okay now clique full of niggaz with tempers
Clique full of niggaz and killer
When they cut me I don't pay them
With the two them nigga eyes remember
I'm the same lil nigga from the block hoe
And I drive still walk with the Glock on
I'm about that cream, guap' large on
Don't get me started up hoe
I come to whip in the Phantom
Y'all niggaz really can't stand it
Them hoes really be jockin
Diamonds done got them watchin
Say Ace ain't gettin no money
Pussy, I beg your pardon
You don't wanna get me started
You don't wanna see how I'm ballin
Okay okay, what it look like?
Well that good thang got and it's good night
With a bad bitch, she's so thick
She rolling, I know this
And her neck gon' froze, better know that
Act up, I smell like a Kodak
And these niggaz these niggaz
These niggaz these niggaz
These niggaz these niggaz won't hold back

[Chorus]

[Ace Hood]
Okay them pussy niggaz be hatin
Focus on what I'm makin
Came through in that Phantom
Them pussy niggaz can't take it
Spent big bread on my chain
Still on stroke with your mabe
I'm rich nigga like yeah nigga
They hopin I stay the same
They say I changed when I got fame
Bitch niggaz, they complain
Flat black in that two door
Nigga must think he Bruce Wayne
I'm like damn Hood, what it be like?
Hold 'em down as your knee lights
New bitch like e'ry day
Swear to God you won't see her twice
That purple that got me leanin
They don't wanna get me started
Come on this hook, no phonics
Introduce this shit and go retarded
Chopper in the trunk in case your mood swing
Extended clips that's standin tall - 2 Chainz

[Chorus]

[Outro]
