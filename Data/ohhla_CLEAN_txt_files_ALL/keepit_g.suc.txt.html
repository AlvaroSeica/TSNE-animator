Song:   Keepin' It Gangsta
Typed by: Lil Hustle

Whoa oh, it's Corleone...

[Chorus: Big Moe &amp; Mike D]
Keeping it gangsta, keeping it gangsta
I gotta keep it gangsta - 3x
Keeping it one hunnid, for my niggaz that ain't wankstas

[Mr. 3-2]
My guns loaded, coming to a hood near you
Bitch niggaz, gotta find somewhere to run to
Thug up, my whole family from the gutter
Lifestyle, raised in this motherfucker
T-shirt, dickies and some house shoes
On the 'vard bad, doing what I gotta do
In a G ride, mobbing with the top down
Fo' deep, and everybody got a glock now
Laws hot, got a warrant out for my arrest
I ain't going back to jail, without some kind of plex
It's my life, and your life what it come down to
I'll be the last man standing, I'm G fool

[Chorus - 4x]

[Z-Ro]
Too, many fellas they be false flagging
Flags in the wrong pocket, I'ma let my lil' nigga sage go
Get the gauge, and cock it and pop it motherfucker
This here, be gang banging at it's finest
In a Dodge full of stash spots, the laws ain't never gon' find it
Z-Ro the Crooked, your hustling heiness
Please stop nigga re-hold what you got, lick em up shots
Until them on glock, and that's a sign of toilet paper like Pac
Is the Prince coming to get me out
Cause ain't nan nother nigga, gon' reach me
I promise I've been trying to calm my nerves, I just need somebody to teach me
Wired up, with my weapon busters got me fired up
Motherfuckers that be repping the wrong color
Get bound deceased and tied up, 'gizer
G-A-N-G-S-T-A, soldiers united for the cash

[Chorus]

[Trae]
Ain't no games finna be played, when I step in the do'
It ain't nothing but slugs finna let go, and clear the block out like the 5-0
Fuck these bitch niggaz and these hoes, I'm on a mission giving out my pain
They gave my right hand all fifteen years, and now Spring Branch finna know my name
Gangsta is what you can call us, fuck biting my tongue I gotta be raw
Payback everybody better lay back, don't get your bitch ass tough to get spray back
Lately I been gone off that other shit, S.U.C. forever be my click
You can see we gangsta for li', with every word we spit
They never thought it would happen, these niggaz came off the block to rapping
Any one of these niggaz disrespect my team, bitch we gon' be scrapping
I'm keeping it gangsta, never no love for none of you gangstas
And if you plex you gon' get dealt with, by niggaz that's down to shank ya

[Chorus]</pre>
