"Mmm, there he go again"

[Skillz]
Uhh, "The World Needs More Skillz," volume one let's get it
Ass kiss to the haters, middle fingers to the {CRITICS}
I hear y'all... but most of y'all should quit it
If ye ain't got it by now homey you're not gon' get it
Heh, that's no diss, I'll admit it
But if I had yo' swag and yo' wrists, I'd slit it
I got Siamese talent, God wouldn't split it
Twice as nice as a basic rap nigga, get it?
Heh, I hope a truck hit y'all niggaz
Twice, cause I don't even FUCK wit'chall niggaz
... and that ain't even on the low
I kick a rapper down some steps and count him as he go
Oh, I know, your bro's not crazy
Y'all just playin notorious like Gravy{?}
If I was white, I'd be Shady, I'm a giant
You tinier than Toya, yeahhh babe!

[Chorus]
The world needs more Skillz, I gotchu
Big kid shit that get props too (yeah)
This be the shit y'all rock too (yeah)
This be the shit y'all rock too
The world needs more Skillz, I gotchu
Harvey McCartney, he get props too (yeah)
This be the shit y'all rock too (yeah)
We make the shit y'all rock too (yeah)

[Skillz]
I'm where amazing happens, you've seen me play
I'm in a league of my own, nigga the N+Me+A
Highlight, e'ry night, it's like I wow myself
And this game don't stop even when I foul myself
Heh, you in the nosebleed row
with some thunder sticks prayin I miss the free throw
Oh, this a hot ass flow
I should put some helium in this bitch and watch it go
Man my flow at the top of the trees, your flow
stopped growin in ninety-three, it's Jermaine Dupri
Hehehe, word to Virginia Black
I put Virginia in the steel, got Virginia on my back
Uhh, and I don't change my grind
I was gon' let you get next, but I changed my mind
Skillz, I gets that fee
They say the world need more of somethin?
Shit it need more of me

[Chorus]

[Skillz]
You stuck on star, you won't see me fall
Before you see that you'll see Biggie Smalls in a mall
Y'all rappers could use some help
You soundin like every other rapper except yourself
He said I sound like Drake, like I care
He did sound like Drake though - heh - the one in the wheelchair
We show Skillz on the mic
If I was y'all I'd get familiar with what second place feel like

[Chorus]</pre>
