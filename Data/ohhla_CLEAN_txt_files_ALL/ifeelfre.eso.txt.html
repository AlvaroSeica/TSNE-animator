Album:  Circus in the Sky
Song:   I Feel Free
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Just the other day, you walked into my life
And now every time I see you look away, I feel a change
My body starts to shift and shake
the strings to my heart start to break, and everybody looks the same
And I feel free, oo, I feel free. I feel free, cause you're not lookin at me

Holdin onto memories like holdin close to handlebars

Yeah, the lone bus go with no coin in the hat to pay the rent
Music's the only thing that's makin sense
And he sits there all day, hopin you'll hear it
With his eyes closed he opens his spirit
He's focused and fearless once spoken his lyrics
Like pain in the rain, you wouldn't notice a tear drip
A simple story of a girl and a guy
so watch what happens when their worlds collide

It was yesterday, I went walking alone
Out of the corner of my eye there you were
starin deep into my soul. Life is different just a day ago
because now I see who's in control
And I feel free, oo, I feel free
I feel free, because you're looking at me

The true artist is forever together
nothin can kill his dream
Cause with or without her he'd always be free
Strummin his heart strings, striking chords
Every moment's a choice like sliding doors
Here we roll from home, but love was here though
And love's the stuff that don't just appear-o
It wouldn't be worth it without his mates
He wouldn't have learned shit without mistakes

And I feel free, oo, I feel free
I feel free, cause you're not lookin at me</pre>
