So he fooled me, ooh ooh

This fools crazy foul left up but how
Never do we Spooks allowed got official style
Ming Xia, she be the fifth element
Minipulate the mind shape and get your back ripped
Heart to heart combat eliminate the nonsense
Bend checks, and existence, malice
Who thought that you taught, I read now, but nah
Fist fault from verbal assault, the spy must die

So he fooled me, this time
Next time I'll know
Thought you knew me
But all you really know
Is what I choose to show
Yeah

Sweet like thee (honey)
Need I speak (deadly)
Venemous revenge, so sweet
Sweet like thee (honey)
Need I speak (deadly)
Venemous revenge, so sweet

Tried to do me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to fool me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to use me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to screw me (apparently don't know)

Maybe not, maybe not, maybe not today
Maybe not, maybe not, maybe not today, hey
Maybe not, maybe maybe not, maybe not today
Maybe not, maybe not today

You should've known
That what goes around
Comes right back around again
And again and again
But now I know
One of life's hard learn lesson
So be ready I'm comin' (my friend)
I'm..

Not so sweet (honey)
Show my teeth (deadly)
Venemous revenge, so sweet (whoa)
Not so sweet (honey)
Show my teeth (deadly)
Venemous revenge, so sweet (oh oh, oh oh)

Tried to do me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to fool me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to use me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to screw me (apparently don't know)

Oh Mister Tough Guy, jiggy, mackadocious
Pimp of the year, lady slayer
Don't lie, say it
You simply thought you could deal with Ming Xia
Post her up and play her
Heartbreak game, it works on the average everyday
But she ain't that, so don't pain that picture
Mister, all you know is she wrecks it
You concerned 'bout your car gettin' wrecked
Yet instead
You feel the sharp blow, punch through your chest
Instantly, your shirt's burgandy
Yeah, you wish she was the type to slash tires now
Don't ya, don't ya

Maybe not today
And maybe not tomorrow
So be ready, I'm comin'
So be ready, I'm comin'
So be ready, I'm comin'
Ready I'm comin'
Venemous revenge
Venemous revenge
Venemous revenge
(Didn't want it to be this way, but you)

Tried to do me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to fool me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to use me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to screw me (apparently don't know)

Tried to do me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to fool me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to use me (apparently don't know who I be)
Tried to screw me (apparently don't know)</pre>
