Koolaid, Flex, Black 1 

(Lil' Flex) 
Would you buy me diamonds or lots of ice ? 
Would you buy me a Benz and not ask the price ? 
Better yours than mine, I won't trick a dime 
But if it's comin' out my pocket everythang is fine 
You'll spend the cash, and won't let me smash 
I'm too playa for that there you can go head pass 
I like shinin' too, you be grindin' too 
I got other female friends thats as fine as you 
I do thangs for you, you do thangs for me 
I'm as real as real gets and its plain to see 
The 1st times a front, took you out to lunch 
Spent 50 on your food you didn't eat that much 
Better ask your friends, I'll smash some twins 
I peep game from a distance like a contact lens 
Can I swang the wheel, in your red Seville 
I put food on your table you can pay your bills 

Chorus (Jhaime Music &amp; Deep Throat): 

You triflin (Hoodrat, roachin' type of sista) 
We TYPs (When a girl like cash we gon' dismiss ya) 
We ballers (When times get hard we need a woman to help us out) 
Instead of (A girl like you who don't know what a playas about) 
Can you pay my cell phone bill? 
Put Baggettes in my grill? 
Buy a house on the hill? 
Then maybe we can chill 
If you can't come through 
Then you gon' get the boot! 

(Koolaid) 
Hold up, everythang was gravy, till u start talking 'bout dem dollars 
Tryin' to be another Gangsta Boo, but uh 
I'ma make you holla holla 
Like JaRule, I'mma act a fool, can't get a dime from O and me 
Better ask my potnas,t hat boy Lil'Marcus 
Can't forget that F-I-V to tha E 
That's J-Five, we struggle and strive, up in this game for finer things 
Breakin' up all them poster schemes 
Can you put bling bling up in my ring? 
That's your bestfriend, I'm talking baggettes 
If you really wanna uhhh keep it real 
Baby I'll drop half on the bills, 
but you gotta put more rocks in my grill 
That's 50-50,not 80-20, trying to stack my paper up real tall and long 
Talkin' down on my name like Jenny Jones 
Now you blowing up my phone cuz I'm ridin' on chrome 
Better leave me alone and get Lil' Daddy to pay your bills 
Cuz you don't know nan playa with my skills, 
so you better chill and keep it real 

Chorus (Jhaime Music): 
Can you pay my cell phone bill? 
Put Baggettes in my grill? 
Buy a house on the hill? 
Then maybe we can chill 
If you can't come through, then you gon' get the boot! 

(Black 1) 
Can you pay my bills 
Then keep it real with me for show, 
Cuz I'm TYP, Throwed Yung Playa 
So you gotta let me know, cuz I'm so for show, 
have plenty mo', and they couldn't keep it true 
So I'm telling you, if you don't come through 
girl you gon' get tha boot 
You can call it hard, or call me fraud 
If that's what you would like 
But if you want it all, from a man that ball, 
girl you gotta come at me right 
Wanna drop ya half on a Bentley or Jag, you trying to get over 
You better hit ya stash and grab ya cash 
Or wish on a four leaf clover 
Don't do no trickin' baby, and I think that you should know 
Can't you tell by how I act when I'm spending my dough 
You say I'm tight, call it what you like 
Bet you won't spend yo' dough 
But you on tha under, with Reshawnda, playin' like you broke 

Chorus (Jhaime Music &amp; Deep Throat): repeat till end 

You triflin (Hoodrat, roachin' type of sista) 
We TYPs (When a girl like cash we gon' dismiss ya) 
We ballers (When times get hard we need a woman to help us out) 
Instead of (A girl like you who don't know what a playas about) 
Can you pay my cell phone bill? 
Put Baggettes in my grill? 
Buy a house on the hill? 
Then maybe we can chill 
If you can't come through 
Then you gon' get the boot! </pre>
