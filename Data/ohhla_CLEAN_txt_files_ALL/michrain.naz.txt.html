[Chorus: Bronze Nazareth]
I smoke more bone to embrace through my brain the pain
But it stays consistent like 'Michigan Rain'
I light an L and blow to maintain to the sane
But it stays consistent like 'Michigan Rain'

[Bronze Nazareth]
Word, I blow a haze cloud thinking about my way out
And grey clouds got me looking up from my ways down
I shaved thoughts and misses from grave clowns
Throw up prayers like half poured shots, but still it rains down
Everyday heavier, swim now or never
On my block is shot, let up with dead ones
Whose head hung, jailed and heads spun
Mind on his money, got it pawned on his grandma's best rug
Did his best to feed his son, broke back and arms slung
Nobodies seeing light, dog, harms overcome
Me I'm seeing broken houses, silent war songs
Baseheads in Hell when fiends sing the chorus long
To the melody of felonies, no Sun in the ozone
Running back and forth on blunts for build the cyclone
Niggas know me for my nine hold, how my mind mould
Time slow, page his time with sign shown
The pain is felt to marrow of the bone
Some cracked sidewalk where many failed to grow

[Chorus]

[Bronze Nazareth]
Word, I smoke a tree house tryna get my seed out
Sky turning black, mean good weather to see now
I bleed the blood of the shaky youth forsaking truth
Elevate prayers with weed smoke that never come true
It turns to sludge too, hailing like they do
Gandhi on my own block, marijuana float like Ali
We soak up the Sun, approach it wisely
Money on my mind, got me signing my next mic piece
Doing my best to proceed in dark where the grime lead
Always see in dark, no lights shown to radiate it
I keep on seeing if he's reaching, eyes widely dilated
Attempting to remember that these my people where ______
Heads running the bases like America Park, you see the traces
They know I got the buckshot waiting, invading the building
Time flies, life's ironic like brave villains
The pain is felt to the quarter main vein
Same broken dreams and many always failed to obtain
