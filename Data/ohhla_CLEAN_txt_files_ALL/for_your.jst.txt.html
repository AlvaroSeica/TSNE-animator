Song:   For Your Hood
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Hook 2X: King Just]
We don't bang your shit if it ain't tight
And if it's alright, then it's all good

[Chorus: King Just]
We do this all day, we do this all night
We don't bang your shit, if it ain't tight
And if it's alright, then it's all good
This is for your hood, this is for your hood
I got that Park Hill with me (I don't give a fuck)
I got that Stapleton with me (I don't give a fuck)
I got that Now Born with me (I don't give a fuck)
I got that Wild West with me (I don't give a fuck)
I got that Port Richmond with me (I don't give a fuck)
I got that Jungle Nilz with me (I don't give a fuck)
I got that Arlington with me (I don't give a fuck)
I got that South Shore with me (I don't give a fuck)

[King Just]
Park Hillian, rap villain, raps so hard make gravity's spin
Cats done begin, had to be him in
Fans be like we glad to see him
That way we meet him, cuz I treat 'em
They ask for food for thought, so I feed 'em
They ask for the guiding light, so I lead 'em
They ask for the hottest boys, so I heat 'em
Might deceive 'em, but I still owe
Still no reason, but I still flow
Henny 'dro, Remy, Mo, fast slow, here we go, yo

[Chorus]

[King Just]
Back again, ask your friend, ain't that a-train and your van
That can't be him, no gats that came, last seen in that dollar van
Hollerin', holla man, if he can't do it, no one can
No one ever thought the plan, Ginger, Maryann
Gilligan, trapped on the Shao', heard they wild
Smoking black and mild, Henny style, heard they rolling pows
Watch the phone dial, fed files, give 'em as they take now
Lay 'em down like tiles, jack niggas like childs
I stay and fight like Kobe, niggas know me
Show me, homey, but you phony, why you think I left you lonely
They can only be, one and he right here, I sware
I tear, and I gon' bring fame round here, yea
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall, before you walk, you gotta crawl
You can say what you wanna say, when you wanna say it
And pray and pray for my downfall

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
