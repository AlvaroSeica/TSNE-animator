[Talking]
Uhh, one time for my nigga Ivan much love

[Verse One]
Nigga's up'n gun's, and I wish that they would
Cuz, I'm done with them nigga's slangin'
Rock's in the hood, 
Third Ward, Tenth Ward, Seventeenth is where is at
If you done with this shit, you better strap yo gat
Put yo dope on the streets, hommie you better be wise
In this dirty as game, only the strong survive
Late night creep, nigga's smoke in the day
Took a bump from that powder, now he reachin'
For his Tec, livin' Downtown ain't no glamorous life
Cuz the Ninth Ward villains rat-a-tat at night
Now ya beepin' a nigga with yo
Drop top in yo lap, 
I want what 'cha got, ain't no time to get kidnapped
Fuckin' with a nigga, took a chump out his bank
Pop the glock one time, when we left he was stank
Now the nigga's in trippin'
When they got caught slippin'
Nigga's think they gonna change,
Just be True To Tha Game

[Chorus]
Let me know nigga? Who got the money
Where is the dope-a? Who got the yay-o
[4x]

[Verse Two]
Just got out the pin, refused to work for
The white man, put some bullets in my gun and
Some can in my right hand
Cuz I got to get mine, and I might have to pump lead
What's the fuckin' diffrence, just another nigga dead
My enemies nesscary, I got to get money
In this dirty ass game, you only live one time
Two o'l clock in the mornin' street sweeper in my seat
Goin' to drop of a package in that STP
Say you better be strapped, when you slangin' in the day
Cuz a late night villian, quick to put you in check
If my life is sellin' drug's, no pain no game
I ain't gonna be no sell out nigga,
Cuz I'm True To Tha Game

[Chorus-4x]

[Third Verse]
People used to tell me, all the hero's are dead
To what it take's to survive,
Put that gat to a nigga's head
Nigga's gettin' robbed at night
But that's part of the game, can't accept get a new life
Anything goes, ain't no rules in this shit
Nigga's packin' Tommy Gun's, and they K's with banana clip's
Murder is another part, nigga think you trippin'
That's the price to pay for all that stuntin' in tirppin'
Got busted with a Ki, like an sassy ass nigga
Ratted on yo hommie, now they goin' up the river
You wouldn't take the pressure, you wouldn't take the blame
Should have been dead bitch,
You wasn't True To Tha Game

[Chorus-4x]
