(Rhythm is both the song's manical and it's demonic charge)

(The rhythm)	--&gt; Chuck D

[ Diva ]
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm

[ Everlast ]
I'm Everlast, born to be a Caucasian
But it makes no difference what persuasion
You are, as long as you know how to get up
Get on the floor and start working a sweat up
To a musical measure that makes you move
Soon as the needle's dropped into the groove
So get up and dance to the gift I'm givin
Forget all your troubles, get into the rhythm

(The rhythm)	--&gt; Chuck D

[ Diva ]
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm

(You make me feel so gorgeous)

(What more can I say?)

[ Donald D ]
Yo yo, you know what the world needs
We need (peace)

(Keep their heads clapping)
(The music just turns me on)

(The rhythm)	--&gt; Chuck D

[ Diva ]
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm

[ Donald D ]
You linger for the rap singer
When Donald D brings the
Party to the tilt my presence is worldwide
You don't dance to this - that's suicide
Put your hands into the air, I'm the MC cop
The girlies are pipin hot
Notorious rhymer is how I'm livin
Don't step to me, step to the rhythm

(The rhythm)	--&gt; Chuck D

[ Diva ]
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm

(You make me feel so gorgeous)

[ Everlast ]
And like I said before, the worlds need a lot more (unity)

(Okay buddy - start playin)
(The music just turns me on)

(The rhythm)	--&gt; Chuck D

[ Diva ]
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm

[ Ice-T ]
Listen to the track as it rolls, watch the mic as it glows
The lethal weapon got you trapped inside a dance mode
Ice-T is throwin words at you like dodge ball, y'all
You gotta move or get hit, and if you're hit you fall
No jokin, no boastin, no braggin
Grip the mic like a .44 magnum
Dust you off if you're suckers, I ain't
You want me to write soft rhymes, I'm sorry, I can't
I rock the rhythm

(The rhythm)	--&gt; Chuck D

[ Diva ]
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm
Talkin bout the rhythm
All we need is rhythm

(You make me feel so gorgeous)

(I know you like the jam)

(For the world to have total peace and unity
we must first have)
(Love)
(Okay y'all, this is it)
(The music just turns me on)</pre>
