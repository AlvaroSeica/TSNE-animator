[9th Prince]
Aiyo, Brussels sprout head ninjas get smacked with the four finger
Lift off the Earth, crushed by the 9th Chamber
Friends turn into strangers, pop ninjas are in danger
Enter my arranger, leave ninjas missing on a milk container
Skim milk, the 9th Prince, rock robes made of silk
Once I kill a man, I never feel the guilt
Only Cuban Link ninjas is built
Walk with a lean, and my hat is tilt
All my fallen soldiers doing time by the boulders
Never let your enemies scold ya
Listen to this rhyme as I shape and mold ya
I'm straight out the comic books, hang you I'm Hangman
I'm Captain Hook, Saturday night live crooks
The judge wanna throw the book
Yeah, it's 2012 and these rap ninjas is still shook
They scared, son, plus, scared to look

[Chorus: 9th Prince]
I'm like Captain America, the black Superman
Wu-Tang Killa Beez are my Super Friends
Live in the arena, I climb the stage like Spider-Man
And swing through your mind as I gain more fans

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, enter my circumference, welcome to reality
The streets is like a war zone gallery
Machine gun armory, buried in the projects closet
Last night, they found 'em lying in the hood and shouted
Let's take it back to the watch riot
Where corny ninjas remain quiet, and stood in they place
Or got shot in they face in other countries
And chop your finger off for stealing
Laying in the bed with Kelly Rowland, mirrors in the ceiling
Ninjas in my family, still drug dealing
So much pain in my life I'm feeling
The little ninja don't trip, when I give you the fat lip
Lady sings the blues with my dick
My cum she wanna sip, don't play me like my name is skip
Cuz I keep a four fifth on the hip

[Chorus]

[Outro: 9th Prince]
Word up, word up, the 9th Prince
Yeah, yeah, Shaolin Prince album coming real soon
Let's go ya'll, yeah
Yeah, Wu-Tang Super Friends
The Avengers, yeah, we back ya'll
