Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, yeah, yeah
(boo)

[Chorus]
let the fire burn
(boo) let the fire roar
(boo) bouncin' back and forth to the beat
(boo) gettin' angel wings to soar high
high (high), high (high), high (high), high (high), high (high), high (high)
yeah, yeah, yeah
high [x2]

I gotta hit and then submit it to it
let the flame consume me, control me, that I would listen to it
glisten while it's christenin'
rhymes that bring precision through it
lines paintin' vision through it
lives resurrected through it
game well respected for it
and that's why we so true with it
and ain't gone never be through with it
why we so hot, but cool with it
so fresh, so clean, so new with it
so let the fire burn
and let the fire roar
build ya body baby
trust me you'll be comin' back for more
lack for no more
thirst for no thing
hurt for no pain
a lust for no man
a woman not yours (whoa)
and that's the truth man
hundred fifty proof man
swig some and get dumb, so you could get high, so high, so high.

[Chorus x2]

Sink in favor, with your big behavior
flash across the screen, it inflict the flavor
cherish and embrace in every moment savor
unconsciously, our conquest
aimlessly they goin' bonkers smokin' on dat bombs as
foolishness and nonsense, we barely scratch the surface
not on purpose, about a thousand times around with countless minds
we pass they're lives as worthless
we poke our nose when them boys pose
we curious to see, what's goin' down when doors close
figure out they Morse code
they box up they emotion
cause commotions
beyond, they act like big fish in a pond
but really rocks in the ocean
boarded eyes
saw da score in '94
and we cleared the floor
pores that were sore
mended wings 'til we reached the core
where fire burns (fire burns)

(Boo)
let the fire roar
(boo) bouncin' back and forth to the beat
(boo) gettin' angel wings to soar high
high (high), high (high), high (high), high (high), high (high), high (high)
yeah, yeah, yeah
high.

[Chorus x3]

(Boo)
(Boo)
(Boo)
(Boo)
High [x8]

[Chorus x2]

yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah</pre>
