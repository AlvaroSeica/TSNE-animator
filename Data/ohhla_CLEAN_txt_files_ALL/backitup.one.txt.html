Back it up
Back it up
Back it up
Keep it going
Back it up
Back it up
Back it up
Keep it going

Chorus:
(Fingazz in background)
[Fingazz] Back it up
          Back it up
          Back it up
          Keep it going
          Back it up
[Uno]     Like a truck
          That's what's up
[Both]    Keep it going
[Fingazz] Back it up
          Back it up
          Back it up
          Keep it going
[Uno]     Put that thing in gear (Back it up)
          Little mama, bring it here (Back it up)

[Verse 1: Mr. Lil' One]
Now what it look like, mama, come talk to me
Let's talk about lust and monogamy
Let's talk about us in the room alone
Knockin' them boots til the break of dawn
And tell them boys, they can play along
Hate on ya boy, but they love the song
That's why I do all the things I do
Call all your girls, we can bring them too
Uh
Feels so good to be you
Swoop that ass up, straight out of the blue
Now, gather 'round, come close to me
And post right here where you supposed to be
It's like that, mama, no whoopty whoop
Let's travel the world, le's get this loot

Refrain: Mr. Lil' One
Now wiggle that {*female moan*}
Move that body
Y'all don't know, better ask somebody

Pre-Chorus: Mr. Lil' One {Mr. Lil' One *slowed down*}
When you hear that sound
You better watch it now
So when you hear that sound
Little mama, drop it down {Down, down, down}

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Mr. Lil' One (Fingazz)]
Now ladies love Lil' long time, all day
Love 'em right back, treat 'em all the same way
Hey
Everywhere I go, they wanna play
Back it all up from Dego to the Bay
East coast ladies (Drop it down low)
Midwest baby (Bring it up, slow)
Don't nobody ask, see they already know
Come down to Dego, you know where to go
Te gusta, mami, your boy got estylo
Pull up to the club, hit the valet with C-note
Everybody lookin', mamis all flashin'
Lights {*camera flashing*}
Camera, action
Everybody dancin', shots of Patron
Ain't nobody in here, goin' home alone

Repeat Refrain

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Mr. Lil' One]
Now baby in blue got back for days
But the one in the red move lots of ways
And the one in the high heels (Make that pop)
And the one in the mini-skirt (Just won't stop)
Let me grab all four to the V.I.P.
Every lady in the place got they eyes on me
DJs spinnin'
Kitty Kat bumpin'
Everybody's faded, the whole club jumpin'
Back it up, baby
Show me how you move that
Turn on the camera and show 'em how you do that

Repeat Refrain

Repeat Pre-Chorus

[Fingazz]
Back it up
Back it up
Back it up
Keep it going
Back it up
Back it up
Back it up
Keep it going

Repeat Chorus
