Special special
Look at how your neck glow
Look at how you walk by
Look at how you're dress flow
Special special
Ooh, you so perfecto
Love the way you throw it back
Baby you so retro
Special special
Look at how your neck glow
Look at how you walk by
Look at how you're dress flow
Special special
Ooh, you so perfecto
Love the way you throw it back
Baby you so retro

Fly as you want to be
Never been a wannabee
Can I stick around
See the woman that you gonna be
Working all night
Cause in the day you still a student
Keeping to that check
Girl I love the way that you do it
6 feet of coopery
Blue box in your jewelry
Come and see the world
You can tell that this ain't new to me
Shopping in Milan
You like, oh my God I want those
Once you try them on
I say, oh my God I love those
Get them if you want
I came up a couple bucks
Niggas wouldn't hit me back
Same niggas hit me up
That's enough, back to you
Girl you sexy and you cool
You don't even know it's true
That's what makes you beautiful
With your hair up in a bun
And your feet up on my lap
You were sipping Pinot
I had a cup full of the yak
Had my hands all on your front
But my hat was to the back
And as soon as we was done
You was hollerin' run it back

Special special
Look at how your neck glow
Look at how you walk by
Look at how you're dress flow
Special special
Ooh, you so perfecto
Love the way you throw it back
Baby you so retro
Special special
Look at how your neck glow
Look at how you walk by
Look at how you're dress flow
Special special
Ooh, you so perfecto
Love the way you throw it back
Baby you so retro

Prettier than Jada P
Come and have some kids with me
We can name her willow
I ain't playing
I'm for real though
But we gotta hurry up so she can grow up with Blue Ivy
Like a big sister, keep her outta trouble probably
Gotta keep it real
That's the only we keep it
And I love you cause you G
You don't keep no little secrets
When the niggas try to holla
You just tell them niggas beat it
Uh uh uh, Mike Jack, they walk away defeated
Show me someone better
Where she at I gotta see it
See it with my eyes
Cause right now I don't believe it
We turning up the heat
Cause you a little bit anemic
And I prefer it cooler
But you love it so I leave it
Uh uh, you got it girl
You really picture perfect
You don't had it hard
So when you get it you deserve it
You deserve a palace with some grapes
A couple service
Uh Don't let them tell you, you ain't worth it
Uh uh uh

Special special
Look at how your neck glow
Look at how you walk by
Look at how you're dress flow
Special special
Ooh, you so perfecto
Love the way you throw it back
Baby you so retro
Special special
Look at how your neck glow
Look at how you walk by
Look at how you're dress flow
Special special
Ooh, you so perfecto
Love the way you throw it back
Baby you so retro</pre>
