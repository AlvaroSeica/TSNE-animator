Upon a place already locked for failure
it's some things about this Earth that I just got to tell you
we can linger 'round in circles till' our socks inhale us but you see
I got a purpose and I'm not for trailing
so I tell it with no fear not even sudden regard
that we are heading for the years that we'll be covered in scars
and everything won't be so kosher
and everything we're scared of won't be on posters
but till the flames and the hailstorms smother the Earth
I will remain to sustain all coming disperse beyond the day we receive our closure
and everything I prayed so I can see my daughter...

And walk holding hands in the land of the pearliest gates
and watch her dance in the sand as my personal faith
is elevated to a level unheard of
and that being the end I ought to tell you what first comes
a time where the crimes that we witness
could never devastate you like the bombs that'll hit this
every single state that so involved
with decisions and any weaker nation after that
changing Earth into a toxic habitat
with not an African American or Asian around
you can forget about Caucasians and the races we found
cause every human suffered nuclear poison
and now is either mutant or a mutant ignoring it
and seeing that we all have tails or an extra limb or fingers
coming out our neck and talking breath that kills
I bet you then it won't be no problems
but on the other hand
it won't be no warning
but now you all can say...

Hold on
now...Oh
I know... Hold on
now...Oh
I know... Hold on
now...Oh
I know... Hold on
now...Oh
I know...But till the flames and the hailstorms smother the Earth
I will remain to sustain all coming disperse beyond the day we receive our closure
so you can be aware as these days get closer...

And never have to wonder why the government is conjuring reasons
and the cover-ups for something every couple of seasons
till that day in history is forgotten
but till our enemies could finish things that they plotted
our people will be blind to the fact
that every single day we walk alive on this grassland
is yet a single day that's closing down on our last
and all the devastation after that
losing all we love to never have it back
with not a rapper that could tell you how to change it around
and no more laughing ever since our planet came to the ground
and every human realizes what 'poor' is
and now regrets the moment they let money absorb them
but seeing that we all have chances and lessons
will we take upon it or just save it for the next few years
I bet you then it's only worse of a problem
but on the other hand
I was the person to warn you
but now you all can say...

Hold on
now...Oh
I know... Hold on
now...Oh
I know... Hold on
now...Oh
I know... Hold on
now...Oh
I know...But till the flames and the hailstorms smother the Earth
I will remain to sustain all coming disperse beyond the day we receive our closure
and everything I prayed so I can see my daughter...

As on a night I kneeled and I asked in the silent treatment
to be yielded a chance to decide if peace would be the final-most emotion I have
when all I need is guidance and I'm on a new path
I wanted Him to leave me on Earth for a hundred lifetimes
repeating every birth until the sunset light shines
if I don't become the person to save the people
thinking all in the world is perfect and safe
but all I need is just to see my little sweetie
in the image of me and I will deeply be completed
like a river or sea and know I left here with a purpose accomplished
with not a living person with disperse who could stop it
and seeing that you're far from understanding
I'll let you chill or maybe cover in a paragraph my lesson
then also apologize for given suspense and break it down
and try to summarize and speak what I meant
when I refer to this as Lava Lamp
it's just a metaphor for wishing and following your prayer
like you're gravy over biscuits
although every step you take is drawing to an ending
you're probably so unready for but not if you don't let it go
a lava lamp
know how it animates the darkness and takes away the scary-like effect
that it be causing is what my sleeping daughter's to me and just the reason
I ain't cursing on the top of a beat and if you didn't
now you know...

Hold on
now...Oh
I know... Hold on
now...Oh
I know... Hold on
now...Oh
I know... Hold on
now...Oh
I know...</pre>
