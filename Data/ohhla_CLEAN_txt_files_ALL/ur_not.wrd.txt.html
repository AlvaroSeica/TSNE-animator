What listen, this one dedicated to the forum 
And wanna-be emcees that are nothing
Fucking nothing internet rappers
When was the last time you made money?
Or sat down in a meeting?
Or released six mixtapes in a year?
Like me ha...

Your all wanna-be's please stop calling me
We are not the same you're not as hot as me
Plus I'm cocky see I just mock you geeks
You're a prime example of what not to be
(Yeah) So please dont talk to me
Same old same emcee commodity
With you're modestly I'm like mate honestly
If that's all you got then give up on your odyssey
You try and stand out you use apostrophizes
But you aint got to shout out with animosity
Just say something real and get across to me
And I will get it stuck on my head like a cross to me
You see the scene seems sickening
Too many wanna-be's there're just children
It's not rap if your writing a rhyme
I will tell you something mate get out there and shine

See you, your not emcees
You just someone that's just claiming to be
And I'm not saying you can't do it for free
Just saying (Im saying) your not emcees [x2]

I'm not slaging or bagging I'm just rapping
But you're claiming actions that never really happened
And that's acting when you just imagine
You not like me you see you lack passion
(Yeah) Plan I kick like a magnum
And I'm smashing you pussies like shagging
I be bragging and cant take a slaging
So dont slag me unless you can take a stabbing
Its like I'm putting up a flare damn
S.O.S. wont you get us out of here man
We been stranded we planed it right here and
Yeah it hurts but I dont shed a tear damn
So will I sell CD's?
Or will you download it for free
Is it fair you pay for release
When to this day I never paid for beat

But your not emcees (Your not)
You just Claiming to be
I'm not saying you cant do it for free
I'm just saying your not emcees</pre>
