Get up, learn how to talk
Check them letters I'm a drop
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H
If you want more, better gimme the bass

S-W-F like W-W-F, in a puddle of breath, sweat MC's to death
In a D&amp;G dress, ride a bumpy beat like a B-M-X, now oh
S-M-S text for S&amp;M sex, x-ray specs, filthy, that's F
D-K-N-Y vest, you impressed, I got I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P left
On the L-E-S, yes Q-R-S, tea for two, me and you
V-W, no, B-M-W, X triple X, Y-Z-Z, cuddle you
U, S-I-C, A-D-D, so 1-2-3, 3-2-1, ooh
In the 2-1-2, don't know what to do, 2-1-2, don't know what to do
Let's see, N-Y-C, M-V-P, A-P-B on the L-I-E
Tell the N-M-E, friends and me, T-N-T on our T-I-T's
Like boom boom, baby, boom boom boom boom

Hey, if you wana go out tonight, you better get it right
Be like A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O
Hey, if you wana go out tonight, you better get it right
Be like A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O
Hey, if you wana go out tonight, you better get it right
Be like A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O

Tasty freeze men to their knees, P-Y-T's in the P-V-C
B-B-C to N-B-C, I'm watching you from out the T-V
Switch if off, it's alright, it's a standoff, I'm the boss
Get you back and more, check the record rack
in the store, a million of me lookin' back in the mall
Price tag on my face like a whore, ice in my bag like D-I-O-R
Built like a C-A-R, programmed like a V-C-R, alright
And if you figure that, with my figure I, earn seven figures then
You just learned the word figure again
and I just made your brain bigger again, C-N-N

Hey, if you wana go out tonight, you better get it right
Be like A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O
Hey, if you wana go out tonight, you better get it right
Be like A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O

All of a sudden, ain't I somethin', eat K-F-C in the V-I-P in London
Runnin', take the H-O-V, C-C-2003 T-C-B
H-M-V get D-M-C, B-I-G, Schoolly D
Call the C-D-C, I'm gonna sneeze, achoo, I like the letter A, do you
C-I-A, get away, T-W-A, upright tray
Q&amp;A about my T-N-A, D-N-A, F-U that's T-B-A
Call triple A, they're on their way, I'm gonna take over the W-E-A
Might wanna warn L-A, you can keep it warm for me till that day, ha, ha

Hey, if you wana go out tonight, you better get it right
Be like A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O
Hey, if you wana go out tonight, you better get it right
Be like A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O
Hey, if you wana go out tonight, you better get it right
Be like A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O
Hey, if you wana go out tonight, you better get it right
Be like A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O

Alright, you better get it right
You like, A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O
Alright, yeah, you getter right
You like A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O, A-A-E-E-I-I-O-O-O</pre>
