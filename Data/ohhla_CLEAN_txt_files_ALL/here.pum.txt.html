[Pumpkinhead]
I'm not goin nowhere man, I'm right here
So keep sendin the hate, that only shows fear
You'll never relate to my blood, sweat and tears
And guess what man, I'm still here

The fact that I'm still here (uh-huh) puzzles me to this day
I guess God and his apostles wanted it this way
I been here since Dana Dane's "Nightmares"
Since Craig G battled Supernat', I was right there
I been around the block where the homeless folk drink beer
I been around the world, but I'm still here
The birthplace are worst case scenarios (Brooklyn)
Church faith in stereos I'm here, here, here we go!
From song to video, I'm trapped in a screen
attached to a beam of light, I can capture a scene and write
to my heart's delight, can you hear what I recite?
The words of an endless fight
Here we are together, one voice, one cause
No flows, oh Lord, applause
My song's, so real, so raw
And if you, think that I'm too soft
to diss you, dawg then you're so wrong
Cause I'm here, yes, and I stand strong
I'm here, yes, and I stand strong
I'm here, yes, and I stand strong

[Chorus 2X: Pumpkinhead]
I'm not goin nowhere man, I'm right here
So keep sendin the hate, that only shows fear
You'll never relate to my blood, sweat and tears
And guess what man, I'm still here, yeah

[Pumpkinhead]
I got a pain in my heart, and it hurts but I'm still (here)
After all these years, through the boos and cheers
Bummy gear and nappy hair, I'm still (here)
So fuck you, and the backpacker you worship
The last supper to turn up in clown make-up at the circus
And that CD you purchased is worthless
Full of mutated hip-hop
This ain't electronica, stop makin my culture your pitstop
It's not, that I hate your musical preference
But in essence, it's not workin
How you gonna tell me I'm not hip-hop, and you don't know who Kool Herc is?
Am I so beneath the surface I'm unworthy to be on your top ten nerd list?
They say I'm weak and my albums don't sell
I'm only a battle rapper, please, do tell
Well, get back to me after about a year
When this album's gone ghetto gold and I'm still here

[Chorus]

[Pumpkinhead]
I been stabbed twice, near death, one breath
But I'm still (here) I've been outcasted, betrayed, looked at as less
Nevertheless, God blessed, he showed me the way I'm still (here)
Give me my props, or I take 'em by force
at any cost, I refuse to be ignored
I used to be that kid that got, played for a herb
'Til I gained weight and I made them niggaz kiss the curb
Trials and tribulations, miles of aggravation
All types of elevation, my struggle to bless the nation (uh-huh)
with the greatest form of entertainment, hip-hop
They said it was a fad, it'll pass, nah man
It's still (here) ha ha, I guess he was wrong
Now you lovin my song, like a hit from the bong
We still (here) so as we adjourn
My final word is this
Hear me out for what you hear you can't miss {*echoes*}
