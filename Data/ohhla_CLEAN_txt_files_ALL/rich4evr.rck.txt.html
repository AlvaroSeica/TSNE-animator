[Intro]
{M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Regardless of how it goes down, life goes on
Am I right?

[John Legend]
On the way we shed some tears, every day we sacrifice
So we can be standin here, oh what a hell of a life!
Been winnin so many years, and the future is bright
Now it's very clear, that we gon' be rich foreverrrrr
And everrrr, and everrrrr
Oh oh oh oh
We gon' be rich forever, oh oh ohhhhh
Oh oh oh oh we gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever

[Rick Ross]
I remember being blind to it
'Til the day I put my mind to it
Pen and pad on the dresser for me to fine tune it
I sat in the corner, made up my mind, do it
Def Jam on my heels, should I sign to it?
Million dollar advance for me to rhyme fluent
Every day I'm hustlin on every corner boomin
Back of the Phantom couldn't fathom I was such a student
Grandfather deal for the Godfather
Lucian Grainge from the ghetto, I follow God's orders
And he told me I was rich forever
And he showed me I was rich forever
They call me Mr. Roberts when I'm in the bank
Digits like the Dodgers when it come to franks
Flossin out in Compton like I got a cape
RoseMo tried to fight it, but barely niggaz fade
White sheet, yellow tape, where your dogs at?
Count a million cash, can you blog that?
Me and niggaz your type never exchange numbers
Want to conversate and steal game from us
See the watch, now you want to know the name of it
Never playin so I went and got the frame flooded
Cartier, Hublot, I could name a dozen
Your shit pushed back ccause it ain't buzzin
Now these thugs actors all of a sudden
Niggaz hustle backwards all of a sudden
Can't talk snow, where the soft at?
Your man got merked, but you squashed that
Hope you knowin what we call that
I think you know just what we call that
... All you pussy boys fall back
Big face Roley, rose gold cost 40
Platinum 21, it's time to go and spoil shorty
You only live once I'm screamin YOLO in the V.I.
Time flies fast balling with my nigga T.I
Ciroc, no glass, smilin women in my presence
Tall supermodels always fall in my possession
Atlanta housewives takin pictures in my section
But I only got a thing for young bitches with aggression
Show me that affection that a D-boy craves
Rich forever in my D-boy waves
So dope, blue jeans, new J's
Sold dope by any means all day

[Chorus: John Legend]
Been winnin so many years, and the future is bright
Now it's very clear, that we gon' be rich foreverrrrr
And everrrr, and everrrrr
Oh oh oh oh, we gon' be rich forever

[Rick Ross]
Uhh~! A hundred mill' ain't enough
Got a hundred women, gotta deal with it, love
Worth forty M's, is he still dealin drugs?
Cigarette speedboats, but he's still with the thugs
Club Liv, Louis shots on a Sunday
Grindin even be legit one day
Order some more bottles, cause I'm on one
I know her pussy wet, and she wanna cum
She wanna cum, maybe come over
Stop dealin with them niggaz, you need one soldier
Keep you as my bitch forever
Cause you know a nigga rich forever

[Chorus]

[Outro: John Legend]
On the way we shed some tears, every day we sacrifice
Oh oh oh oh, we gon' be rich forever
