CotDAMN!  Life is pretty pretty smooth
Lishus got a job that pay the bills and buy the food
Alotta dudes is struggling their stomachs fucking rumbling
Fumbling for crumbs while economy is crumbling
Yet I'm bubbling my company is stacking bundles and
It's lucky I stay coming into work the money tumble in
But hold it, um, this thought keep buzzing maybe I should muzzle it
But fuck it why my bosses don't do nothing yet they doubling
Their dough just by shoveling mad work on me it's puzzling
That Lish can't get a sip of the sweet life that they guzzling
Ain't I taking a pummeling while I be rumbling keeping us bustling
I'm cutting my knuckles I'm up in this scuffle I'm grunting while bosses stay chuckling
My knees knocking and buckling under the workload I'm juggling
Got nothing a coupla crumpled up bills the sum of em's under a hundred and
I struggle for nothing compared to the supple amounts that uppercrust tucking in
But I'm outside looking into the club that doesn't induct me, so fuck it then
I want dough by the duffel you know, like them drug runners smuggling
Or funded blue blooded republicans like Rush and Rumsfeld, and Trump and them
Fuck all this muscling my way in hustling just to earn my lunch
Toiling working until I die?  I'mma beat life to the punch
 
HOOK:
Yo word to Kurt and Elliot incredibly bored males
When faith in the lord fails indelibly scored tales
Get made and props to Puff and Suge who made the bucks
What's good know
Being Deader than doornails is better for more sales
So I bled over chord scales this letter of scorned wails
I'm deader than doornails fans will head to the stores yayuh 
 
Oh, shit! Life is pretty pretty nice
New York got the girlies sweet as pie I want a slice
Statistically it's stacked for me to splack it on the daily
So many single women fewer men means the Lish stay playing
Running around with my pants on the ground mad girlies be down if the booty is round
And she's cute in the kisser delicious won't diss her especially if the girl gotta twin sister
But hold up, on second thought I reckon I best not just get to wrecking
Sinning raw diggity skin to her skin that's the business that ruin the sexing
Can't hit it carefree where sole concern be penetration
That's when fun goes up in flames, burning sensations
Did I mention dating scene in New York is a cesspool
The copulatin' population a mess of horny, stressed fools
A third of these birds have herpes it's absurd to me yet be urging
her to slurp it concur with insertion not securing the gerkin's insurance
Without out wrapping the pecker in plastic before we getting to wetting the mattress
If you don't you go insane from speculation, mad stressed
And even then be careful, before you hit it with her, please
Check her bathroom Valtrex, condoms don't block out the herpes
What's more fucked up, you hope to god it's gonorrhea
Not the monster HIV, yuck, got me hollering well seeya
To my momma brother relatives and all my friends
Kids fear monsters under their beds, but between the sheets it spreads
This is the shit that runs through your brain since you got up to line up at eight
At the free clinic your sitting in watching that vid about sticking the tip in
when beginning to hit it simply no difference than when hitting it skin upon skin and
risking in it big for minutes of bliss wind up with shit that's killing the Lish
And is it my imagination, or did the dick start itchin'  and achingÂ…? 
Right on the tip?  Man, I can't take it
Fuck!!  (southern) Man, I knew I shouldn't a deeid eeit! 
 
Dirt nap, on my terms seems pretty pretty good
Accomplishing in death the shit in life I never could
And the only way to do it? I'mma blow myself up!
Like I wanted to do it in music? I'll blow the hell up!
And I think I'll be taking some fools with when I blow myself up!
Ready my 70 (2) virgins, homie, load my vest up!
With an act of terrorism kill a pack of terrorists and
Make the world a safer place when danger T makes dissipates
The irony's so sickening it'd kill ya, like it will me
Ya feel me? Life ain't awful but it ain't exactly thrilling
Or maybe I should set a sting like on To Catch a Predator 
Lure em in with craigslist set address at which their deaths occur
And make requests: no sticky candy, please, it gets stuck in my braces
When they show up, aim for moustaches, bust a cap in their faces
And shit, I'm taking requests, let me know who you think should be snuffed out?
Life's just sorta meh, I'll make it better the rest ya,/and then bust out
Kaboom</pre>
