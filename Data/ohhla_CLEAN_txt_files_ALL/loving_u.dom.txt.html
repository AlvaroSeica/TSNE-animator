[Intro: Dom Pachino]
I mean, we had some good times together though, right
Damn I miss your smile, I mean
It was probably for the best, yo

[Dom Pachino]
Sometimes I miss her, used to hug and kiss her, miss insecure
I used to diss her, that used to piss her off
I was her nigga, but was more like a father figure
Taught her how to cook, clean, and get a nut off
Was I good man? Merely, to be sincerely true
I was fucking Jasmine, Linda and Shirley
What could I do? I was lusting, boo
Besides that, I was not really trusting you
Now why's that? Maybe all the clubbing
All the tight clothes, maybe cuz
YOu was hanging out with some trife hoes
But I love you, despite those
But if I can't trust you, while I'm out on tour
I can't be yours
Music's my first love and you're my second
I told you that, the first time that I got you naked
So respect it and everything'll be splendid and if not
I'mma have to end it, matter fact we already ended

[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino]
Loving you is, easy cuz you're beautiful
But, beauty can only get us so far

[Dom Pachino]
We went from lusting to huggin and loving to not trusting
From holding hands in the park walking, to not talking
From being obsesesd, to being under arrest
For domestic, I couldn't hurt you, couldn't have that on my record
Know my conscious, and babe I'm saying honest
We had something special, even though somehow we lost it
But hearts are meant to be broken like good pussy meant to be soaking wet
And you're a girl I never forget
Remember going home late nights with hickeys on your neck
And getting smacked by your moms and told to have some respect
You ran right back to my lab all mad and upset
I whiped your tears and licked you places, should I just say?
I made you forget, snuggled up was the way that we slept
This is young love as good as it gets
And your friends was jealous of what we shared
We made a promise that we'll always be there
For each other, one way or another

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
