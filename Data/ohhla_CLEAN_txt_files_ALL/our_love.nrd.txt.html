[Intro]
{"Our love has no reality"} Uhhh
{"We both have a fantasy"} Yeah, gotta let it go
{"Our love has no reality"} Geah, uh-huh, uhh
{"We both have a fantasy"} Yeah

[Nerd Ferguson]
You meet a person and it's workin out, got your heart perkin out
Now you flirtin workin to get a smirk or a smile
Such a departure from all of the hurt you workin with now
Used to be perfect but is it worth it to work with it now?
Only around to avoid the guilt of hurtin your spouse
when you wipe your hands of it all, to desert and be out
We ain't compatible, every word you say just makes me mad at you
Then you get mad at me after you pick up on my attitude
Uhh - almost slept with other chicks tryin to get at a dude
Just to see my guilty conscience had me runnin back to you
I'm unhappy and so are you; but we been together
since we was kids - so really all I know is you
I lie to myself, sayin it'll get better
when the truth is each day is another prison to weather
Uhh - at this point, shit is whatever
We've grown too far apart to even attempt to get it together UH~!

[Chorus]
{"Our love has no reality"} Yeah
{"We both have a fantasy"} Uhh, gotta let it go
{"Our love has no reality"} Yeah, can't be afraid to walk away yo
{"We both have a fantasy"} Yeah, uhh

[Nerd Ferguson]
We tried to make it work, you cried cause you was hurt
and when your tears dried, you realized I was a jerk right?
Then it hit me that you were more manipulative
than you were detected in the beginning of this
Don't know what restricted me from predictin this shit
But once I got the picture I knew I wasn't stickin with this
We ain't compatible, I shouldn't have to batter you
then you just cop an attitude sayin I turned my back on you
How the hell you think that we 'posed to be startin now
when we try to move forward and get followed by a dark cloud?
They say I've changed since the days you got to know me
Villifyin my actions while still in love with the old me
I've come to learn that the old me is still here
But the shit we've been through makes it hard for me to feel here
I'm just bein real here - it's either love or obligations
So ask yourself why are you still here?

[Chorus]
{"Our love has no reality"} Uhhh
{"We both have a fantasy"} Yeah, uh, gotta let it go
{"Our love has no reality"} Yes, gotta let it go, yeah
{"We both have a fantasy"} Yeah, uhh, f'real</pre>
