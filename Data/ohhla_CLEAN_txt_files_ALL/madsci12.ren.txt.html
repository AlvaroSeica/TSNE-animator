[Intro: MC Ren]
uhh, uhh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Darkside is where I'm comin' from all alone
strangling busters that's fakin' on the microphones
cause I've bein' around and I'ma be around again
who is it? The black brother that they call 'Ren
Won't be braggin' on a 9mm
my steel toe kicks, turn tricks, I use sticks and stones
so say what's up to my brothers on the sidewalk
put on my black to jack so I can night stalk
cause to carry a big stick for brothers that never shot beabe gun
always talkin' 'bout the trigger
just to get paid, they make it all routine
if I crack pop they runnin' from the scene'
There's to many records out that ain't sayin' nothin'
and fake-Ass-Radio stations ain't playin' nothin'
shit gotta get back, it's time to M.C
to many new brothers ain't sure like I be
I wanna be L and only care from the crean
Applause like a bitch they get put in the magazine
you ain't fresh, you ain't ride on, you ain't the source
Nigga wanted to get with me, but your shit was horse
Ploakin' in my cliss of war for competition
hypocrite niggaz hang around to get a listen
Try to peep in my note book, but lost a leg
Got paralised neck up from what you read, a mad scientist..

[Chorus: DJ Train Scratching]
Ren is in control, here we go again scare the people to die
a fuckin' mad scientist
Ren is in control, here we go again scare the people to die

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Weak-Ass-Niggaz keep eyein' this
but who can come and fade the mad scientist
I've been away from the public, cause I am an enemy
with the black peane disappear like Houdini
God of the universe, I control your soul
shaking niggaz up from the bottom of the north pole
In my double S four fifty four
with my size ten, steel toe shovel to the floor
It's simple, don't wanna make it complicated
cause you simple minded niggaz might get frustrated
with your bang-bang boogie, cause Ren heard enough
cause niggaz nowadays don't come with the funky stuff
that I used to hear in '83 and '84
when shit had to be hardcore "ciminal minded, you've been blinded"
I'm lookin' for some shit like that but can't find it
"6'n the mornin' police at my door"
niggaz don't make that kind of shit no more
sippin-Ass-Niggaz make way, cause Ren don't play that shit
I'm screamin' mayday, a fuckin' mad scientist..

[Chorus: DJ Train Scratching]
Ren is in control, here we go again scare the people to die
mad scientist
Ren is in control, here we go again scare the people to die
Ren is in control, here we go again scare the people to die
Ren is in control, here we go again scare the people to die

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
Sneaky, sneaky that's how I creep up on you
I clear my throat and then I drop bombs on you
now be honest
did you think the Villain will let new niggaz come out turn out the work
that I put in, I'll pick up the pen and I write
to the hands feels of the writies
shit down and dirty you were swear these apetaitis
I be creating what your body longs for
and fake-Ass-Niggaz this is who the song's for
a mad scientist, but I won't make a Frankenstein
I just write a rhyme that'll blow your fuckin' mind
You can't follow this I didn't leave a cent
you can't fool the 5 procent that me and Train repesent
I'm wokin' up light, and livin' civilized
the messager Elaise that done open up my eyes
And the B-boys stance on my throne in black
niggaz scared as hell because the Villain is back
from the center of the earth for makin' way like a gopher
nigga by my self I'm takin' over, ugh a mad scientist..

[Chorus: DJ Train Scratching]
Ren is in control, here we go again scare the people to die
mad scientist
Ren is in control, here we go again scare the people to die
a motherfuckin' mad scientist
Ren is in control, here we go again scare the people to die
a motherfuckin' mad scientist

[Outro: MC Ren Talking Over Chorus]
yeah, yeah, I wanna what's up to the droppers of bombs
yo '94, '95, a mad scientist
