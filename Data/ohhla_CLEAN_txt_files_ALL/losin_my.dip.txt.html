[Juelz Santana: Verse 1]
Ok people welcome me back been one hell of a year but I'm healthy and back
Long time no see HAA, where I been where I be HUUUH, in the street HAA
Now I'm back to ride this horsey like YEE HAW
YEE HAW, EE AH GIDDY UP NOW
TO THE SOUND OF THE TOUCHDOWN....AYYY, I just scored a touchdown
YAY! And I sit in the days y'all, twisting the haze y'all
I don't listen to rap I listen to Dre I listen to "Hey Ya"
I'm one hell of a fly, hell of a guy, who better than I
Nobody I'ma tell you that and believe me I never did lie

[HOOK]
COULD IT BE I'M LOSING MY LOOOOOVE (FOR THIS RAP SHIT)
COULD IT BE I'M LOSING MY LOOOOOVE (MAN I'VE HAD IT)
COULD IT BE I'M LOSING MY LOOOOOVE (FOR THIS RAP SHIT
COULD IT BE I'M LOSING MY LOOOOOVE (DAMN I'VE HAD IT)

[Juelz Santana: Verse 2]
Y'all labels got it all confused, kid
I'm not at all amused...with
The boring music, y'all approve it, it's all some bullshit
Seems that y'all all amused with, everything that got to do with party music
Well I ain't in to damn party and moving, but we could still party to...THIS
C'mon CLAP! (Clap 15x)
C'mon CLAP! (Clap 15x)
So steaming hot, believe or not, can't seem to stop (NOPE!)
Til the day I get leaned and popped, 'til my breathing heart breathe and stop (SO!)

[Juelz Santana: Verse 3]
I might as well keep puffing my weed
Like this shit means nothing to me
And I'm what I call G's, y'all what I call fleas, y'all what I call sucker MC's
So all y'all sucker MC's, come down please, class has started
Everybody lay ya #2 pencil UP!....now lay ya #2 pencil DOWN!
And that's ya career, after a year so glad that I'm here
So glad to be here, after a year but I've had it to here
With all this fake and rap, shaking this....you faking that
Homeboy you are fake and wack so please stop faking jack
