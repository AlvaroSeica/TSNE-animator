I enter, take my seat at the bar
Order Hennessy straight up with a straw
Adjust my person so my person looks good
"Look at her, Look at her, Look at her"--I look good
Slip out the benj, watchin the mens, bartend asks for 10's
Don't understand who I am apparently
But that's ok cuz I see someone kinda special
Especially lookin at me
Big brown eyes big brown chest tank top mesh
Gold chains kinda fresh
He checks, he flex, he steps, I guess I'm the WNBA
We got next

The ill figure in the Hilfiger
10 feet away, I'm about to parl-ay
But wait, what the hell is that
My eyes start to water, big hair falls flat
No need for intros, my nose has met you first
I gotta make a call, I think I lost my purse
Lets play doctor, I'm a be your nurse
Give you a sponge bath disinfect you first
"My baby left me, left me all alone"
That's right I left you you should have known
better than to wear that stinky cologne
"My baby left me, left me all alone"
Damn straight I left you, you should have known
better than to wear that stinky cologne
What's wrong C, yo what's wrong C
It's my gland, I think it's olfactory
I was walkin and talkin, knockin you rockin brew a perfume
Ain't no stoppin Pepe le Peu

Where's my cleanin crew 'cause now this boo smells like you
Sincere, I gotta wash that man right outta my hair
Atomizer traumatizer I'd advise ya wear a visor with a sign or little lighter
Sayin you'd be wiser to divide up me and my aroma geyser at the diner appetizers
Hurt incisors, insider tip-don't wear the shit
"My baby left me, left me all alone"
That's right I left you you should have known
better than to wear that stinky cologne
"My baby left me, left me all alone"
Damn straight I left you, you should have known
better than to wear that stinky cologne
The moral of the story is this-
You be sprayin this, you ain't playin this
Like Titanic ship, near, far, wherever you are
I smell it, yo step away from the car
Hey Drakkar Noir, peace see ya later
You rode my elevator, I breath like Darth Vader
Just Be. For Eternity. While I Escape your CKB quickly
If there's a cure for this, hell I want it, hell I want it
And if there's a cure for this hell I need it, hell I need it</pre>
