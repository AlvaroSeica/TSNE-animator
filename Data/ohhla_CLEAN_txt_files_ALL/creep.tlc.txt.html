Yes, it's me again, and I'm back
Oh, oh, oh, yeah...
Creep, creep..oh ah, oh ah...

The 22nd of loneliness and we've
Been through so many thangs
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me
I look him in his eyes but all he
Tell me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down
Though I might mess around it's only
'Cause I need some affection, oh

1-So I creep yeah, I just keep it on the down low
  Said nobody is supposed 2 know
  So I creep, yeah
  'Cause he doesn't know what I do
  And no attention, goes to show oh so I creep

The 23rd of loneliness and we don't talk
Like we used 2 do
Now it seems pretty
Strange but I'm not, buggin' 'cause I still feel
The same yeah, yeah
I'll keep giving loving
Till the day he pushes me away, never go astray
If he knew the things I did he couldn't handle it
And I choose 2 keep him protected, oh
(repeat 1)

I think about us baby all the time
But you know that I'm gonna need some attention
Yeah, yeah, can you dig it?
Love you forever baby soul &amp; mind
And you gotta know it
If you don't give it I'm gonna get mine
(rpt 1)

Oh, ah, oh, ah, oh ah
(rpt 1...)

I creep around because I need attention
Don't mess around with my affection
Oh, oh, oh, yeah...</pre>
