Song:   Who Want to Battle?
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Drunken Dragon]
Niggas say they battling
..Say they battling... who battling, who battling?

[Chorus: Drunken Dragon]
Who want to battle, uh, meet me at the bar, rah
Hit 'em with the raw, Drunk Dragon Fist Bazaar, uh
Who want to battle, uh, meet me at the bar, rah
Hit 'em with the raw, Drunk Dragon Fist Bazaar, uh
Niggas say the battling, meet me at the bar
Hit 'em with the raw, Drunk Dragon Fist Bazaar

[Drunken Dragon]
I smoke your whole party fast, me and my people crashing
Live action, blasting, niggas without asking
What, where, when, why, how dare you dare
Ever declare war, drinking my beer
Puffin' lah, like, oh, no he didn't
Who you think you kidding with that flow you spitting?
Bout to catch an ass whipping, for talking trash
Listen to my nova blast, burning like kids cooking they kitchen
Without no permission or parent supervision
Apparently you missing this bomb shit, it's missing
The sounds bob consecutive, at the crowd I set it off
*Whistles* fireworks like July the 4th

[Chorus: Drunken Dragon]
Who want to battle, meet me at the bar
Hit 'em with the raw, Drunk Dragon Fist Bazaar

[Drunken Dragon]
Who want to battle, step into my lair
Dungeons and Dragons, who wants to be a player?
Call me a hater, cuz it's the way my shit
Make a nigga realize you'se a faker
Dope style taker, one sheisty move maker
A little more soft and sweet, and I can bake ya
Who done man take me for, ya want war?
I kill you, you kill me, we still war
Trapped by the law, yo, I'd rather get money
Got no time for whores or these bonafied dummies
Talking bout what you can do, well show and prove
Some make moves, take your brain off snooze
Eighteen Manchuz, scheme and lose
Get fucked up like you had weed and booze
And my dogs eat food, unless you choose
To be the roast beef special on today's menu, yo

[Hook: Drunken Dragon]
Meet at the bar, it's the bizarre, bizarre, what
Hit 'em with the raw, Drunk Dragon
Meet at the bar, it's the bizarre, bizarre, what
Hit 'em with the raw, Drunk Dragon

[Drunken Dragon]
I got snakes, creepin' all around my section
Take my sword of justice, sever legs and collecting
Soul power, from MC's I devour
Snatching niggas up by the collarbone, microphone
Regular, stranger, re-arranger
My style is infinite, I burn MC's when I spit
Equipped with a masterful mind, the rhyme simulated
By the wine, the harborer, rhyme writer
Definite reciter, while you bite another nigga rhyme
I mastermind, the dirty dozen devastator
Save the wackness, for practice, I freeze ya flow
Like Artic winds, styles I invent, now

[Chorus: Drunken Dragon]
Who want to battle, meet me at the bar, rah
Hit 'em with the raw, Drunk Dragon Fist Bazaar, uh
Who want to battle, meet me at the bar, rah
Hit 'em with the raw, Drunk Dragon...</pre>
