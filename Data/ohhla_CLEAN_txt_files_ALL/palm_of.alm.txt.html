[Chorus]
I could see the bright lights and the skylines where I use to play, use to say
that I'd have the whole world, whole world, whole world in the palm of my hands
way up here I could prove to you there ain't nothing that I can't do
now that I got the whole world, whole world, whole world in the palm of my hands                               
 
I got the world in my palm but I ain't Lil Wanye
(Nah) just another hood nigga made it thru the flame
on the search for the top shit all they want is fame
the industry is killing niggaz, Kurt Cobain
I've been rich I've been poor fuck it I never faked it 
so tell me what's a dream when you ain't never chase it
now tell me what's a chance when you ain't never take it
you going to put me in the game but you ain't never make it
Yessss we started from the basement 
me and spank, we build a foundation
I'm at the point where life is a vacation 
chillin on the the top floor
tell her to take that top off 
 
[Chorus]  
 
One for PAC other one for Aaliyah
this for Left Eye, I hope I get to meet ya
I do this for my sisters that's stuck in the struggle
they back against the wall and nobody loves you
don't let him put you down 'cause no one is above you
the man upstairs  HE the only one to judge you
we all gotta eat so we all gotta hustle
no matter how big he is don't never let him touch you
Yessss for all my brothers with a mother (who else)
and all my brothers with a sister (listen up)
I'm about to paint a picture
how would you feel if your pops was to hit her!
 
[BreakDown] 
Tell me how would you feel (how)
tell me how would you feel (how)
tell me tell meeee

[Chorus] 
 
Listen now see I'm destined to be great
so I give it all it takes to make it (to make happen) uhhh
and it's far beyond the clouds
so I'm strongly reaching out to take it (I gotta make it happen)
And I ain't looking back and thats a fact I gotta do his plan
it feels like I got the whole world in the palm of my hands 
 
[Chorus]       
 
We going to make it out, gonna make it out, I said we gone make it
make it out, gonna make it out. Bring back one time
From way up here I could prove to you there ain't nothing that I can't do
now that I got the whole world, whole world
whole world in the palm of my hands  </pre>
