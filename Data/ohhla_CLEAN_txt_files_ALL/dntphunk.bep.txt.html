No, no, no, nooo
Don't phunk with my heart
Yeah
No, no, no, nooo
Don't phunk with my heart

[Chorus]
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby (love, love)
(love, love) In love baby
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby (love, love)
(love, love) In love baby

Girl you know you got me, got me
With you're pistol shot me, shot me
And I'm here helplessly
In love and nothing can stop me
It can't stop me once I started
Can't return it once you bought it
I'm coming baby don't doubt it
(Don't make me wait)
So let's be about it

[Hook]
No, no, no, nooo
Don't phunk with my heart

Baby you have to trust him, trust him
When I come with lustin, lustin
Cause I bring you that comfort
I ain't over here cause I want ture
Body, I want ture mind too
Interestin' what I find you
And I'm interested in the long haul
Come on girl yee-haw
(galloping horse fx)
Come on

[Chorus]
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby (love, love)
(love, love) In love baby
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby (love, love)
(love, love) In love baby

[Hook]
No, no, no, nooo
Don't phunk with my heart

Girl you had me once you kissed me
My love for you is not iffy
I always want you wit me
I play Bobby and you play Whitney
(All long)
If you smoke I smoke too
That's how much I'm in love wit chu
Crazy is what crazy do
Crazy love I'm a crazy fool

[Hook]
No, no, no, nooo
Don't phunk with my heart

Why you so in-sa-cure
When you got cash and you're love herre
You always claim that I'm a cheata
Think I'll up and go leave ya
For another senorita
You forgot that I need ja
You must have caught amnesia
That's why you don't believe wha
Wha'- Yeah - Check it out

[repeat 2X]
Don't ja worry about a thing baby
Cause ya know ya got me by a string baby

Baby girl ya make me feel
You know you make me feel so real
I love you more than sex appeal
Cause ya

[repeat 6X]
That-that-that-that-that-that-girl

[Hook]
No, no, no, nooo (That-that-that-that-that-that-girl)
Don't phunk with my heart(That-that-that-that-that-that-girl)
No, no, no, nooo
Don't phunk with my heart

[Chorus - repeat 3X]
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby (love, love)
(love, love) In love baby
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby (love, love)
(love, love) In love baby

[repeat 2X]
Don't ja worry about a thing baby
Cause ya know ya got me by a string baby</pre>
