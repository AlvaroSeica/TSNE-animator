[Pharrell talking]

[Verse: Pharrell Williams]
Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes cause you love me
(I'm sorry but.. so sexy)
So you think about a chance 
You find yourself trying to do my dance 
Maybe cause you love me (Uh, you do it well)
So then we tried - think we should slow down 
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there 
And I was gon' tear ya ass up (tear ya ass up)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I know that I'm carrying on, nevermind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin (you know I want ya babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (you should stop frontin babe)

[Verse: Pharrell Williams]
Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gon' calm her ass how it was
And she's gon love it (whoa-oh whoa, yeah yeah)
So then we tried - think we should slow down
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there 
And I was gon' tear ya ass up (tear ya ass up)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
[J:] We got another one Pha-real [Pharrell]
[P:] Dance, ooooooh ooooh
[J:] I call you Pha-real cause you the truth, haha, Young! Great Hov!
[P:] Whoa-oh, oh ohhhh
[J:] Uh, yeah
[P:] Dance, ooooooh ooooh
[J:] Lemme talk to em
[P:] Whoa-oh, oh ohhhh
[J:] I'm a keep it real

[Verse: Jay-Z]
Everytime your name was brought up 
I would act all nonchalant infront of an audience
Like if you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told you do me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be frontin when I'm feeling Denzel 
And you acting like you ain't appealing when you are
Stunting like you ain't my only girl when you are (I was just frontin)
I'm ready to stop when you are

[Chorus]

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Dance, ooooooh ooooh
Whoa-oh, oh ohhhh
Dance, ooooooh ooooh
Whoa-oh, oh ohhhh
