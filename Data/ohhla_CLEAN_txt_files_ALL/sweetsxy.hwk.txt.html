[Chorus 2X: Tommy Whispers]
Shorty, you sweet, sexy, lovey and hot
But don't be like them other grots that got me out of the box

[Tommy Whispers]
Smells like cherries, one whiff of the diva's thong
More ass than Serena, prettier than Nia Long
Me in her arms, with my head on her breasts
Rough sex in the Lex', what's next?
Henny, marijuana or ecst', you make the choice
Keep it moist like a bag of wet, nice voice
And her titties don't, sag off her chest
Lips juicy and fat
Like Beyonce's booty, she give me righteous head
So I call that kuffi, slow down cutie
We was 8th grade classmates, I seen you grow up
Pretty face, and your ass shakes when you walk
It rumbles, making the glass break
She a trooper, shorty bailed me out, on my last case, I love her
And that's something playas don't say, I fucked her
On her period, one day, she was like, ok
This nigga is officla, and he might, could stay
She my pistol and I'm baby girl's AK, AK, AK, AK

[Chorus 2X]

[Tommy Whispers]
Caramel with Chanel, pretty little fingernails
Dirty when she said she was, I don't really give her hell
4.0 platinum V, diamond straight from Zell's
Custom made ring, sit on her hand very well
After three showers, shorty still got the cherry smell
Freckle face ponytail, straight, from a fairytale
Beautiful, beautiful, that be you, that be you
Rainbow rainbow, sunshine colorful
Girl I can fuck with you, get rid of that sucker dude
He don't deserve you, all he do is hurt you
Desert you, you remind me of that purple
You remind me of that purple circle
Oh my God, I'm bout to church you
Throw the flowers in the air, I'm bout to birth you
Know you the one, but yes, you worth two
Special like conditions, put you in special positions
Kissing ain't really the kid's style, but listen
My tongue swirl, tickle that kit-kat, your earth whirl
I dig into your mind, girl, girl

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
