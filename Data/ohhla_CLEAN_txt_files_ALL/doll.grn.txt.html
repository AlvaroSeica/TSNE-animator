Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I don't know how long I can remain composed
All I did was say a flow, and now my father's always told
You should play your part, but I never said I'd take the role
Now every fucking thing I say's a quote
And they catch you out a convict, I'd be lying if I said I was not vexed
Pick up a paper flick a page and see a picture of me on my latest conquest
Fuck it, it all helped
I'm not just gonna stand here making out its all hell
And all's well and good if I put on a pair of rose ticks
Yeah bare arms, just to show ink
My show in croft, but I'm not showing off
I would be if I were to let you know what this costs
Now before ya I'm more subtle than I am flashy though init man
Just know if you don't see it on the wrist it's in the bank
On a mission with a plan, life's a journey and I don't wanna end up in a jam
Where I end up in the hands, of the Gods, when I'm gone, I'll be going with a bang
But for now I'm flying high and I ain't coming in to land
I'm up high and I like life up here, you're running behind
Somewhere in front of you is my rear

They wanna pick me up
Yeah they wanna hold me
Show me off and talk about me as if I'm their hero

How long until they wanna let me go?
They're taming me like I'm their doll

I'm in the mood, in a feud with myself
The chair's wobbling, and my neck is in the news
See what I do, I don't ever get to choose
And today has been a few too many interviews
I mean can I breathe? This new attitude
Is probably gonna leave a lot of people mad at me
Hater life to-be, I'll be glad to see some anarchy
It wasn't the money that changed me it was the lack of sleep
To get to sleep I need more than a bag of weed
What happened last year? I can't even remember back a week
Just became a blur, don't believe everything you've heard
Although I heard Peter Burns just became a 'her'
All these people sucking me and telling me that I'm the shit
Ain't any less annoying than those who told me that I should quit
Do it I said fuck it I shall win, chucking it all in
I ain't a fucking puppet on a string

They wanna pick me up
Yeah they wanna hold me
Show me off and talk about me as if I'm their hero

How long until they wanna let me go?
They're taming me like I'm their doll

I came into this polite, and well mannered..
You know, that, I've always believed that you should learn to tolerate [?]
Cos the world's full of them
I seem to have misplaced my patience
It's how many you's and there's only one of me..
I can't keep everyone out

They wanna pick me up
Yeah they wanna hold me
Show me off and talk about me as if I'm their hero

How long until they wanna let me go?
They're taming me like I'm their doll

They wanna pick me up
Yeah they wanna hold me
Show me off and talk about me as if I'm their hero

How long until they wanna let me go?
They're taming me like I'm their doll</pre>
