[Intro]
Y'all must be out y'all motherfuckin minds!
It's the nigga in me {*4X*}
Bitch~! You must've bumped yo' motherfuckin heads!
It's the nigga in me {*4X*}
Uh, ha, uh, ha, bitch~!

[Rah Digga]
Huh, they gon' read it and weep
They wanna wake a sleepin giant that ain't even asleep
Playin with my '70s and my PS3
I kept hearin my name, I said "Let me see"
{"The bitch might be a nigga for reala, she Rah Digga" - Fat Trel}
Yo what the fuck man?!
(Oooooooooh, get him!)

This guy, you bag of cornmeal short of fish fry
Think I'm lettin this fly, Fat Trel can kiss my
global rap ass, he barely out of D.C.
Tried to look him up, he ain't even got a Wiki
On his records gettin cheeky, tryin to come for she-she
I'm right at the door, like when a dog's gotta pee-pee
Some say it's beneath me, I should be the bigger artist
But this is what happens when you get a nigga started
Man, the veterans, y'all love the reference
Y'all love to talk slick, y'all love to reprimand
Dudes sayin my name, I come like Candyman
Made "Nightmare on E Street," more like Candy Land
And them rhymes you be spittin, sound like rhythm and blues
Mel Gibson what he did to them Jews
This Waka Flocka mixed with Choppa done forgot what Rah Digga could do
Such a lady and I'm still more nigga than you!
BITCH!

[Interlude]
"You remind me of Rah Digga
 A bitch rappin like a nigga
 Or is it a nigga rappin like a bitch?!"

[Rah Digga]
Y'all invoked that spirit, and them raw ass lyrics
From the only female too raw to compare it
To most of these rap dudes that claim they so street
I don't think I'm that rough, I think niggaz too sweet
Soccer mom harder than y'all, man that's pitiful
Now I understand why rap is so ridiculed
Then I'm on Twitter, and I found this joker
Since I'm on my next chapter, sit 'em down like Oprah
Like Yo Gabba Gabba, this no laughin matter
This grown woman swaggered you monkey rap bastards
Keep it in your own bracket, don't get too erratic
This "Hunger Games" shit, I use you for practice
Fuck is you +Creatin+ son? A whole generation of some
Hey Horton, skateboardin, worshippin Satan ass
Bingin on drugs, somebody get me the gloves
I don't think they need deals, man I think they need hugs
And I was tryin to support this young black man
It's too bad you probably lost your only black fan
For now I keep on anointment and the task scam
Take it any further and you might catch a backhand!
BITCH!

[Outro]
  It's the nigga in me {*4X*}
See, you don't have to like me
You don't even gotta listen to my shit
But you will respect me
Bitch~!</pre>
