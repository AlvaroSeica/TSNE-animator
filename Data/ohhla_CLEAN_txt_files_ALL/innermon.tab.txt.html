[Intro]
Remember, whatever discipline you're in
Whether you're a musician or a photographer, a fine artist or a cartoonist
A writer, a dancer, a singer, a designer
Whatever you do, you have one thing that's unique
You have the ability, to make art {*echoes*}
Sometimes life is hard, things go wrong
In life, and in love and in business and in friendship, and in health
And when things get tough, this is what you should do
Make, good, art

[Talib Kweli]
Microphone check one-two one-two (c'mon!)
Microphone check one-two one-two (uh)
We got a little warm-up
Just a little bit, just warm up a little bit
Microphone, mic, mic, c'mon!
Microphone check one-two one-two (c'mon!)
Microphone check (uh) one-two one-two
Yeah! (I think it's time)

This 'bout to be the realest shit you ever heard
I lynch rappers, got them hangin on my every word
These bitch rappers be claimin they slingin heavy word
Really snitch rappers, niggaz singin like every bird
Rich rappers, nah I don't know them niggaz
Niggaz don't get rich rappin, they sellin clothes or liquor
My flow is sicker cause I flow with vigor
I'm no beginner, peep the whole agenda
Control my center cause I gravitate with +Gravitas+, this my inner monologue
Burnin down your party cause our cocktails is molotov
My crime mob make you stop, lock and drop, don't get wollywop'd
Actually battery in my back, like a copper top
Got it poppin, started on the B-side of "Body Rock"
Direct to fan, I'm runnin my shop, like a mom-and-pop
Modern-day slavery today to be an artist, watch
They treat 'em like a product and try to mount like a hot and tot
These molly pop, niggaz not carin if they body rot
Partyin like Mardi Gras, get the cream like Häagen-Dazs
Golly gosh, this is Utopia, cornucopia
I'm known to start revolts against the Romans like Zenobia
Hopin to keep copin copious amounts of opiates
Tried to start a union but they blocked me like a Soviet
I hope they get it, I'm sick of explainin history
I'm rollin with a circle of winners, we claimin victories
It ain't a mystery, the hate'll make it bittersweet
They hate when I engage to debate 'em like Wale's Twitter feed
Who I'm kidding? I'm the great debater
My crew stay winnin, we stay innovative
Your circle is rotten as great tomatoes
They get high with you then start dry snitchin like José Canseco
Prosecco, I'm sippin vino with a vivid hue
Haberdasher rockin Borsalinos like Hasidic Jews
Pitiful, rappers never stand up to the ridicule
That's why I had to get at you, wear it if it fit the shoe, nigga

[Interlude: unknown singer] + (Talib Kweli)
Baby just shine your light... (microphone check one-two one-two)
Shine your light (microphone check one-two one-two, uh)
Baby just shine your light... shine your light
If you've gotta dim yours, so they can shine brighter
Just stay bright (microphone check one-two one-two)
So shine your liiiiiight (microphone check one-two one-two, uh)
Baby just shine your light... shine your light
If you've gotta dim yours, so they can shine brighter
Just stay bright (microphone check one-two one-two)
So shine your liiiiiight (microphone check one-two one-two, uh)
Baby just shine your light... shine your light
If you've gotta dim yours, so they can shine brighter
Just stay bright (microphone check one-two one-two)
So shine your liiiiiight (microphone check one-two one-two, uh)
Baby just shine your light...

[Outro - over Interlude]
We're in a transitional world right now
Because the nature of distribution is changing
The distribution channel's the people that built over the last century or so are in flux
For print, for visual artists, for musicians
Which is on the one hand intimidating, and on the other immensely liberating
The rules, the assumptions, the "now we're supposed to's" of how you get your work seen
And what you do then... they're breaking down...
The gatekeepers are leaving their gates
You can be as creative as you need to be, to get your work seen
The old rules are crumbling
Nobody knows what the new rules are
So make up your own rules
