[Solomon Childs]
I'm on my way girl, I miss the hell out of you, girl
Refuse to have them take you from me, girl
I got a big crib with a room for you, your boots
Bags and jewels, don't worry bout your momma, love
She gon' love ya poppa real soon
Cuz for me it be the stars and moon
I know she, watching my eyes when you walk across the room
So button your coat, put on your hood and stop crying
And don't move, cuz I'mma be there real soon

[Teairra Mari]
Damn ring, now my life ain't filled wit nothing but the drama (drama)
Just had the worst fight ever with my mama (mama)
She believes that you've got two or three on the come up
Telling me you're loving me, but you're going home to them
Damn I hope she's wrong cuz boy I love the ground you walk on (walk on)
She knows that your ties in the streets can be fatal (fatal)
She's threatening to disown me if I don't let this go
Lord can you help me before I blow, I'm so afraid

[Chorus: Teairra Mari]
I'm at the phone booth, my mom just pissed me off
I can't take no more, can you come and get me from the phone booth
She's telling me to break up, cuz you ain't gon' do nothing but hurt me
Come get me from the phone booth, it's raining, I'm crying
Damn I hope he ain't been lying to me
Come get me from the phone booth, my mom just pissed me off
I cant take no more, can you come and get me

[Teairra Mari]
If I leave (If I leave) where will I go (will I go)
Will you take me in like you told me before (me before)
Prove that she was just being hysterical (hysterical)
Show that what she thinks ain't reality, no
I love her (I do) same time (I love you)
But you both are making me choose (See what I go through for you)
Boy you better hope the future that you're promising me
Is as real as the 45 up under your seat
Come on

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Teairra Mari]
I've been through so much (Much)
I cant be done like that again
Hope you ain't been running (Running) game
And cuz I'm so in need, ohh (Damn I got me so in need)
I'm in love (Love) that's gonna give me (Give me)
What every girl prays for each day (Someone who knows how to love)
Damn, I don't see your car
I hope that you're on the way, ohh

[Solomon Childs]
See when it love, your jumpshot like Bonzi Wells
Blowing poems like Ricky Bell, playing kiss and tell
What they think you need a scrub? Nah, you need a man
Just a young general with a cartel
Gucci bags and vanilla, kalua's and chocolate milk
Playing tropical villa's, mixed vegetables with stew fishes
No time for them bird bitches
Tell 'em we in love and mind they own business

[Chorus]</pre>
