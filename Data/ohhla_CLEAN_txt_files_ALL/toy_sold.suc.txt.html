Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
We're toy soldiers

[H.A.W.K.]
See some love Keke, and some love Lil' O
Some love Pokey, and some love Big Moe
Hold up a second, I'm gon name a few mo'
E.S.G., Grace, Trae and Z-Ro
Mike D and 3, P-A-T
C-W-A-R-D, the DJ and me
S.U.C. soldiers we are united
For all you Screw Heads, it's time to get excited
The album's finally done, it's called The Take Over
I know y'all waited and waited, but now the wait's over
Lil' 3rd and Head, representing the Clover
And Clay from the Tre, it spells game over
See some are original, some afilliated
Some just know Screw, and sit around and say it
I'm an original, and got the balls to say it
Five star general, my skills will display it
Our Screw style, has been called it copied and traced
We bout to change that, and put it back in it's place
M.J. and Den, provided us the space
So we can congregate, and put boys in they place
Dressed in fatigues, the guns and boots laced
Ready to rapid fire, at any sound of bass
This hard shit we spitting, the world gon embrace
And see it's more to Houston, than just Flip and 'Face
C-Note and Red, y'all both got my blessings
It's not my fault, y'all didn't attend the sessions
Don't get me wrong, or be under the impression
I'm not dissing you boys, but let this be a lesson
We came together, we claimed together
It's now or never, let's get this change together
We're all Screw soldiers, everybody I named
Some soldiers locked up, some soldiers were slained
And Lil' Flip I thank you, for repping the name
You're afilliated now, the last link on the chain
Not trying to hate, or make it divisional
But the Screwed Up Click, was built around the originals
That's Fat Pat and Ke, Mike D and E
Poke', M-O-E and then there's me
H.A.W.K., them Boys from Bot-nay
We taking over this shit, get the fuck out our way

[Hook]

(*talking*)
Yeah, if somebody asks you if you S.U.C.
And you got to wonder if you S.U.C., you ain't S.U.C. mayn
You feel me, just cause you know Screw
You ain't S.U.C., you know I'm saying
Niggaz cry for this shit, niggaz die for this shit mayn
These cats on this project, we strive for this shit mayn
The Take Over mayn, we finna make this shit happen mayn
Lil' Sam, Marv, y'all boys in the trenches with us mayn
The Take Over, S.U.C., H.A.W.K. five star general</pre>
