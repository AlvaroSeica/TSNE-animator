[Intro: Papoose]
Brooklyn! Rise to the occasion! BK!

[Sample from "Live Freestyle 95" by Notorious B.I.G.]
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?!
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?!
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?!
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?!

[Verse One: Papoose]
All the thoroughbred borough heads where y'all from?!
All the hundred dollar billion villians where y'all from?!
All the low-key OG's where y'all from?!
Got a gat, cock it back, let me hear y'all gun
Come and take a walk through my hood I'll guide your vision
When niggas who ain't ready to die get shot for livin
Stepped out the buildin another day my time still tickin
But I had to make a U turn damn forgot the biscuit
I stashed it on the side of the sink behind the dishes
On sundays I praise gunplays, that's my religion 
Walkin down the block with a boppin rhythm
Had to take a leak behind the green garbage can who need a pot to piss in?!
That's when I bumped heads with my man, he out of prison
Whattup son? Noticed the grill look kind of different
He had a long scar on his face, somebody jigged him
I got away when he got knocked, wish I was with him
They put the green light out, know how the game go
Niggas die for they colors, gotta respect the rainbow
Take John through the slums just to get a collar they come
Hoodlums threw they guns in the sewers and swallow they gum
Snitches stoppin the funds when they hear the drama they run
So we throw the slugs to their tumors and silence they tongues
Raw ball heist, hand to hand is far more trife
Customers be bangin on the spot doors all night
I told the last customer yo next time knock light
He knocked hard so I copped and took his hard knock life

[Chorus: Papoose]
The mother ghetto where the first thugs walk the crook bone
My borough led the thoroughbreds, Brooknam
Y'all outsiders better look right don't look wrong
My borough led the thoroughbreds, Brooknam

[Sample from "Live Freestyle 95" by Notorious B.I.G.] (Papoose)
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?!
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?! (Brooknam!)
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?!
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?! (Brooknam!)

[Verse Two: Papoose]
Home of the tomahawks was money missin and drama talks
And you can tell a nigga from Brooklyn just how he walks
Them Brownsville dudes carry gas in they draws
Come through rockin a rollie, better have it ensured
East New Yorkers will stab a millionaire 'til he bleed riches
Cop work from Uptown niggas, fuck Queens bitches
Fort Greene killers run up in your livin room quick
Them boys at Canarsie, see you lay your clique on the strip
Nobody politics Bed-Stuy who cares for that political shit?!
We're robbin dog for his Kibbles and bits
Bushwick got beat cops they actin like they own the streets
That's why we drop 'em like a verse and lay 'em on beat
Celebrate easter goin to Coney Island with heat
Just to have a slash out and bang it on the beach
In Crown Heights they be workin them twos
Red Hook hoodlums come around your way or put your turf on the news
Downtown in Pitkin Ave got the flyest sneakers
Youngins takin over trains cursin over the loudspeakers
Flatbush they be totin, leave your top smokin  
Since the trains had tokens them boys kept the locin
From LG to Albany we was born to be thorough
Cypress Hill to Kingsborough but now we the king borough
I'm from Bainbridge, we broke the law for the fun
The cats at Marcy will make you cough up a lung
Wherever you from, represent the hood you live
But keep it that way, don't come across the Brooklyn Bridge

[Chorus: Papoose]
The mother ghetto where the first thugs walk the crook bone
My borough led the thoroughbreds, Brooknam
Y'all outsiders better look right don't look wrong
My borough led the thoroughbreds, Brooknam

[Sample from "Live Freestyle 95" by Notorious B.I.G.] (Papoose)
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?!
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?! (Brooknam!)
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?!
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?! (Brooknam!)

[Verse Three: Papoose]
In the heaven of Bob, my hood them pearly gates is locked
We the reason that cops traded 38's for glocks
We the reason them cabs drive by, never trust you
We the reason you couldn't rock shines in the tunnel
Niggas be starin and walkin, lookin back
But I rob a nigga blind and ask him what the fuck he lookin at?!
Patrol cars just wanna get essential book in pack
Don't get caught in the alleys with Brooklyn cats
Face the fact that's what you worship, so I pray with my back towards the serpent
Hit the underground and changed all the rappers to the circus
Celebrated Ike after he was murdered 
Through tradition we had him cremated put the ashes in the stone and
I wish I could've did magic when they burned him
'Cause the depths of the devilish fire within these matches don't deserve him
Israelites stand on the ave of the earth with his staff givin summers
Knowledge beneath the records of a target wrappings of a turban
Security stay harassin and lurkin
When a Brooklyn thug walk in the club bouncers ask us why they searchin us?!
Why you pattin my burners? You actin like you nervous 
Make a mistake and get shot by accident on purpose
718, 187, y'all faggots must have heard us
Our area code have the same factors of a murder
Wherever you from, represent the hood you live
We'll keep it that way, don't come around the Brooklyn Bridge

[Chorus: Papoose]
The mother ghetto where the first thugs walk the crook bone
My borough led the thoroughbreds, Brooknam
Y'all outsiders better look right don't look wrong
My borough led the thoroughbreds, Brooknam

[Sample from "Live Freestyle 95" by Notorious B.I.G.] (Papoose)
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?!
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?! (Brooknam!)
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?!
Where Brooklyn at?! Where Brooklyn at?! (Brooknam!)
