Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Cno Evil]
Woo Woo Woo, you know it, bro
Come on..

[Chorus: "Radio" sample]
Oh radio, tell me everything you know
I will believe your every word, just tell me so
I see the look in their eyes
I see desire in their lies...
You know...

[Cno Evil]
Take care, spike your hair, best beware of the Rough Ryder
The Superstars outsider, grab your girl and hide her
Woo Woo Woo, You Know It, don't blow it
The Internet Champion, he's here to show it
Like him on Facebook, follow him on Twitter
The heavy hitter, will never be a quitter
To all the Broskis of the Week, so unique
That Long Island technique, Zack Ryder physique ("Oh radio!")
Get the T-Shirt, ya best get the headband
Pump up his right fist and smack you with his left hand ("Oh yeah!")
You can ask The Big O, roll with Cno
Catch him on Raw, if you miss it, use the TiVo
With more love than his dad got for JoMo
No more Princess Leia, now he's rolling Han Solo
Then you might catch him on Friday Night SmackDown!
Zack Ryder approved, so smooth to lay the track now
