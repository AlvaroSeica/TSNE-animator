Welcome
We've dedicated our entire album cover
To any person (T)
Who has ever sent us fan mail (L)
This is a journey into life (C)
Love, and the future of music (fanmail)
TLC would like to thank you for your support (Fanmail)
And just like you (Just like you)
They get lonely too (I get lonely too)

Ahhh (fanmail)
Ahhh (fanmail)
Ahhh (fanmail)
Just like you, we get lonely too
Ahhh (fanmail)
Ahhh (fanmail)
Ahhh (fanmail)
Just like you,  we get lonely

[T-Boz]
Waited for you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sittin' Miss alone
We shoulda did this already
Said I got an email today
Kinda thought that you forgot about me
So I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely

1 - 	Baby, I could really get to know you
	Take my time to show you
	Don't tell anybody what we do
	When I get lonely

	Take me to another place where I'll be
	Into space, just you and me with no rules
	Just like you, I get lonely too

Just-like-you (fanmail)
Just-like-you (fanmail)
Just-like-you (fanmail)
Just like you, I get lonely too

Just-like-you (fanmail)
Just-like-you (fanmail)
Just-like-you (fanmail)
Just like you, I get lonely

[T-Boz]
Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't want to come on strong
Cause too many people wanna get me
But a girl will do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely

Repeat 1

Just-like-you (fanmail)
Just-like-you (fanmail)
Just-like-you (fanmail)
Baby, cuz just like you, I get lonely too

Just-like-you (fanmail)
Just-like-you (fanmail)
Just-like-you (fanmail)
Oh, just like you, I get lonely
Just-like-you

[Left Eye]
Man we had all kinda sorts of conflicting fan mail and letters
Some parents was like
"You're the thieves and the pimps and the thugs of stage
And you owe every mother in America
A public apology"

Just like you, I get lonely too
Repeat above while:

[T-Boz &amp; Chilli]
Every day I think I'm gonna meet ya
Can't wait 'till the day I see ya
Know that you just might be the one for me
(I get lonely too)

Every day I think I'm gonna meet ya
Can't wait till the day I see ya
Know that you just might be the one I need

Just-like-you

[Left Eye]
Be me, do what I believe in
And be myself and I suggest (T)
Everyone do the same thing, you do (L)
What makes you feel comfortable 
Do what makes you feel and happy (C)</pre>
