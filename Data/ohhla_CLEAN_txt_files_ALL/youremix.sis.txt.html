Last night we had an argument
Afterwards I'm feelin pretty bent mmm
Then I took a drink
And I didn't think
That was the storm for me

[BRIDGE]
You don't know you don't know how she'll take it
Tell me what is a good man to do
Will she cherish your heart will she break it
Cuz you are everything and everything is you
Sing

[CHORUS]
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you
You are everything
And everything is you

Listen
Baby tell me are you playin me
When you're lovin me
When you're holdin me
And when you're f**kin me
Are you playin me
Playin me playin me
You are everything to me
I'm wonderin if you will see
That I will love you always

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

Break it down
(You are...)

[Ja Rule]:
Uh yeah

And Dru Hill nigga

Baby girl you tellin lies
Cuz when I look at you in your face
I can see I'm on your mind
And it don't matter what them hoes may say
I know your love is blind for me
Every bitch needs a thug nigga in their life
Truly could it be could it be you enjoy me f**kin you
While you be lovin me
Trick and destroy us mentally
That's why they freak wit me frequently
Love is life
