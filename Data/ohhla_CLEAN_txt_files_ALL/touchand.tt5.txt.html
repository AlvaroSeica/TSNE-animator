[Intro: Female]
Warning! The surgeon general of Brooklyn New York
Has determined, that the sounds you are about to hear
Will always be devastating, to your ears

[Tony Touch] (DJ Premier Scratchin)
Let's do it!!!! Yeah!!!! That's the fuck I'm talkin 'bout man! Get up!
(A-A-A-And I'm hittin 'em hard!-Babs Bunny) That shit man! (And I'm hittin 'em hard!-Babs Bunny)
HA! (A-A-A-And I'm hittin 'em hard!-Babs Bunny) You already know what it is right here!
(Hit-Hit-Hit-Hittin 'em hard!-Babs Bunny) History in the makin continuously!
(A-A-A-And I'm hittin 'em hard! Hit-Hit-Hit-Hittin 'em hard!-Babs Bunny)

[Verse One: Tony Touch] (*DJ Premier Scratchin)
Still capicu still sucker free (Come on!)
Comin through with a little company (Say what!)
Now enough of this fuckery
If it's that boom bap rap that you want?! Come fuck with me!
(TOCA!!!) A brand you can trust
Killin shit still with my hand on my nuts (Come on!) 
Back by popular demand it's a must (WOO!)
50 MC's with plans to discuss
Plus! (Say what!) I be the first one to set it
Watch what you ask for you just might get it (Yep!)
Go for mine before I live to regret it (Say what!)
I wrote this rhyme now you could see where I'm head (WOO)
Not bad for a rookie
That's why promoters still book me while y'all playin hookie
And y'all thought I did it all for the nookie
Off the third rope like looky looky (Looky Looky!)
Superfly Snuka
Hit them with the left right left right hooker
Touch and D-Stroy made you look up
While DJ Premier cuts the hook up (*H-Hittin 'em hard!-Babs Bunny)

[Chorus: D-Stroy]
Oooh Ah yes! You are now rockin with the best!
My rap niggas say yes yes! (Yes Yes!)
Oh that's fresh! Come on and bring it out your chest!
My rap bitches say yes yes! (Yes Yes!)
Oooh Ah yes! You are now rockin with the best!
My rap niggas say yes yes! (Yes Yes!)
Oh that's fresh! Come on and bring it out your chest!
My rap bitches say yes yes! 

[Verse Two: D-Stroy]
I'm a D-Stroy! Standin in my D-Stroy stance!
Gotta shine like the glow on Bruce Leroy's hands
Out of this world wild then gettin Leonard Nimoy amped
50 MC's! 'Bout to rip like b-boy's pants
YIKES! Bushwick SON! I am a little nutty
So lyrically kids will love me 'til I kill your buddy
And leave 'em like silly puddy from this Mcgillicuddy
To Magilla Gorilla nigga I'm talkin everybody!
Maxwell, memorex, Tone Touch forever fresh
Headphones hoodie on, light Bill Belichick
Act disorderly, I keep whores with me
'Cause groupies wanna fuck a legend like Kimora Lee
Get up! Stand up! Come and put your hands up
My shit on track 'fore they put us all on handcuffs
Yeah people tweetin D is a beast
Clean version I ain't bleepin with you bleepin MC's
COME ON!!!!

[Chorus: D-Stroy] (*DJ Premier Scratchin]
Oooh Ah yes! You are now rockin with the best!
My rap niggas say yes yes! (Yes Yes!)
Oh that's fresh! Come on and bring it out your chest!
My rap bitches say yes yes! (Yes Yes!) (*H-H-Hittin 'em hard!-Babs Bunny)
Oooh Ah yes! You are now rockin with the best!
My rap niggas say yes yes! (Yes Yes!)
Oh that's fresh! Come on and bring it out your chest!
My rap bitches say yes yes!
