[Sen Dog]
Came back to life for your protection
Back from the dead a resurrection
We came to change the whole complexion
Take this game, a new direction

[B Real]
Last stop where the gats pop
Where the Kush blows free and the lolos drop
It's a photo-op, no flash we smash
Get cash, dash out the fuckin' spot

[Sen Dog]
It's a new day to build, expand the Hill
We grab the wheel, the trip is real
Don't make me pull out the steel
And cause a commotion, emotions kill

[B Real]
Heat-seekers if they come seek us
Serve your asses through your weak speakers
Anyone, anywhere we on jack
Blowin' up another spot with the bomb track

(Chorus)
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Get 'em up, tear 'em up, and put 'em down
Jump, jump, jump, jump
If you act tough, shut 'em up and put 'em down
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Get high then ride, put 'em down
Jump, jump, jump, jump
If you don't give a fuck, throw 'em up and put 'em down

[B Real]
The fear factor, the pit reactor
Adrenaline maxed and we bringin' the rapture
Wreak havoc, we comin' at ya
Studio gangstas are plottin' after

[Sen Dog]
Still with that real shit
I'm the Dog in the cut and real hard to deal with
How long have we held ya down
And broke down doors with the grimy sound

[B Real]
No surrender we push and enter
Take over the scene and blaze the green
Put a chill through your body when you saw my team
Find yourself in the middle where the pit convenes

[Sen Dog]
Don't slip on the misfits
'Cause the minute you pop shit the mic is twisted

[B Real]
Anytime, anywhere we blast off
The riot starters party ya ass off

(Chorus)

[Sen Dog]
We blow smoke in the air to heal the nation
Gettin' you high no hesitation
So off the chain no complication
Take another hit for inspiration
Legalize don't criticize
'Cause one day you might understand what we symbolize
Any man any woman gotta like that
Feds tryin' to build a case gotta fight back

[B Real]
We flip shows like Flipmode
We make you bounce on the track
Wit' sick flows and get dough
Don't trip in the mosh pit
It's a danger to strangers, results are toxic
We're phenomenal, so unstoppable
Unlimited, you're just comical
Stay back, we slayed jack from way back
Payback's a bitch and we know how to play that

(Chorus)

[Sen Dog]
Get 'em up, tear 'em up, and put 'em down
If you act tough, shut 'em up and put 'em down
Get high then ride, put 'em down
If you don't give a fuck, throw 'em up and put 'em down</pre>
