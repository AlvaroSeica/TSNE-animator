[Intro/Chorus - Skylar Grey]
It's so loooooud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drooooown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I can't take back the words I never said (La-sers)

[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, Building 7, did they really pull it? (pull)
Uh, and a bunch of other cover ups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts then, wait here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it then they move it, so you never keepin up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what the fucks
Dude is dating so and so, blabberin about such and such
And that ain't "Jersey Shore" (Shore), homie that's the news (news)
And these the same people supposedly tellin us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was gettin bombed, Obama didn't say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either
I'm a part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful ('ful, ful ...)
And I believe in the people ('le, 'le ... yeah!)

[Chorus - Skylar Grey]
It's so loooooud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drooooown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
Now we can say it ain't our fault, if we never heard it
But if we know better than we probably deserve it
Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is non-Islam and you are not observant ('servant ...)
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store but what you drinkin liquor for?
Complain about the gloom but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listenin to 'Pac, ain't gonna make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts, ain't gonna make it halt
If you don't become an actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash 'em down with diet soda, killin off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world, would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

[Chorus - Skylar Grey]
It's so loooooud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drooooown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said, never said
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even tellin you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailin out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally gettin free, my thoughts is finally yellin through

[Chorus - Skylar Grey]
It's so loooooud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drooooown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said</pre>
