Song:   Super Bowl Cipher
Typed by: pneumatic

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo 2006, Downtown Detroit, fuck Larry Brown
Exploit from out of town, climb, almost fell down
So I'm on some, Charles Bronson, ask your monsoon
Barrel at my waist shaped like raccoons

[Salute]
All these out of towners man, It's lookin real sweet
We was starvin for a meal but now it's time to eat
Loadin up the pistols, Black hoods, Straight for the creep
Plus my daughter need pampers, New shoes on her feet

[Illa Dayz, (all)]
Yo I'm dealin with rapture, My mind intertwine, Swine with pain
It rains so my brain taps, It's hard to maintain, Super Bowl
Parties Bacardi, Two hundred dollars for the tickets
Man split that, I thank God, Ill I'm gifted
Seven Wisemen, We in lets begin. (Seven Wisemen, We in lets begin)

[Kevlaar 7]
We the baddest rhyme bangers, We slangin em whatever
Smokin an eyes ringer, Burnin a brain retina
Better cover your sweater, We niggas under the weather
Snatchin a life, Motherfuckers maintain us

[Phillie]
Ford Field in the D made the setting more real
I'm a hustler, Connected with all boosters and smugglers
The ultimate comes from here, Take a scalpel in the boxing rings
I want my hands on em, Tryna stack brands on em

[Bronze Nazareth]
My steel, See hard blue, Brain off too
Baby do, I'll throw the bullets and you'll receive
If money grow on trees and I'm tryin to rake the leaves

[Salute]
From the city of the hard knocks, Streets we lust
Four foot ninjas aint no doubt, Put our faith in the bus
Get us there, To the prize fam, Truly untouched
Believe in God but it's the gats and the burners we trust

[Kevlaar 7]
Unjust strangle hold, Behold the bold native
Straight up, Hold the gate up, Slap the nasty fader
Stealin pro tools, Yall can feel my love jones

[Illa Dayz]
Patron don't get along, I'm nice plus I'm strong
Blaze said he can't get along, Same as Elway
Throw a pass for a long touch down
Seven Wisemen and yo, We arrived just get down
Seven Wisemen and yo, We arrived just get down

[Phillie, (Bronze Nazareth)]
Welcome home Jerome, Cobo next, (Welcome home baby)
Ray Heart Plaza, Where the sales bonanza
Tee shirts to posters, My motto is the same
I will not lose you can charge it to the game

[Bronze Nazareth]
Got the linesman's gloves plus I shoe shine mugs
See two twenty-three, Introduce my thugs
Fireworks at half time, Not on the field but ohh
When I spotted em, Gave a cough to lick off at kick off

[Salute]
We stay seein like hawks, Mad steel when we walk
Fire play, Fuck around and have you tracin some chalk
For the glow, On the low I will rip you a part
For some Kangols, I'm suppling life fully with sparks

[Outro: Kevlaar 7, (Salute)]
Shit, Yeah, Yeah, And sparks nigga, Word up
It's getting wise nigga, (06 nigga) Word up
The fuckin cipher continues..</pre>
