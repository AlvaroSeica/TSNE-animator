[Bronze Nazareth]
So much I had to go blast a foe
Catch me amsterdam with massive smoke
Surrounded by round cauldrons of hope
I kept babygrande piano off key
Built my name and bolt
Blew the wife engagement rings of smoke when I toke
Maintain my quotes
My pen cathedral chamber stroke
MC's aint in my range or scope
Pirate remain stains I'm cut throat
Slurp Queens, take a picture
Wicker chair like an old king
With silver slave chains
My face just gleam, no bling
Yellow sunbeam
Bullets run through air like california traffic stream
Felons, friends, fiends, on the block, it never cease
Somebody robbed my gate, it had to be these  cottonheads!!
Detroit PD, they ain't stoppin' SHIT!!
They hit my building three times  nigga now I'm popping clips!

[Bronze Nazareth]
So much I had to go
Venezuelan style, kidnap a foe
If I had to ratchet cough collapse and crack ya bones
Hood swat teams send em downstream
Cause we in gotham city Michigan  no superheros intervene
Selling sinister dreams, packing grams in michelins
Gasoline streams gleam on the block, the fiends jumpin in
Last time they broke through the roof  stole my muddy timbs!!
Bloody shirt on the floor maggots creepin in!
Had me looking for a fiend with a limp, loading a clip
Arm sling plus carved limbs, nefarious grin
Of course I never seen him
Ready the blast the Willie Beamon near him
Lay him flat like deerskin, crash his power steering
Stayed elusive as Barry plus Payton on the juices
He gon hit notes like Miss Carey, when the cannon produces!!

[Rain the Quiet Storm]
Ayo the word spread like hummus on the back lots
Grand River backdrops, they looking for you!!
Echoed off his crack rocks,
and they gon lay you pine box
Black tie, black socks, cataracts
Black slacks with embalming smocks!

[Bronze Nazareth]
Confronted him in the cold! Crackhead Diana told
Caught him on Strathmoore, lungs hot as a manifold
Detroit lions chased him thru iron
jungle like antelope
pulled out on cowboy, he ran they heard his ankle broke
snowfall like blankets of death, for cherry snowcones
hey that's Reggie man! yo, tap his side with the toast
U gon take three for a warning, yeah my bro
U robbed the wrong ones, tried to eat ya food an' then run
My mood Bobby Mercer maulin out front when Angel jumped
his hands up, like touchdown, my vengeance is weighed
nudged him in the Black Day Building, iron clangs
police pay no attention, it's dire to maintain
he said we were once the same, but he got caught in a flame
now his daily routine, is making sure the kids ate
along the way began to climb aboard rocks to escape
never been to the mountain, never had a full plate
said he aint mean to offend, but it's expensive steaks/stakes
offered his shoes I commenced to take, so I could see
I'd probably do the same if I were he
the next words he'd speak, built a stunning array
he quoted Martin, as I forgave and put the thunder away</pre>
