[Intro: Bizzy]
Yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, one time for they mind baby
(Buck buck b-buck buck b-buck buck buck buck buck b-buck buck)
Keep the wicked numbers away, haters
I know y'all want some, but you can't get none (yeah)
And it's said for those that we are put around
If they don't entertain us, shall we continue to be around them?
No we shall not, go on about your business
One time for they mind, get to 'em baby

[Chorus 2X: Bizzy Bone]
And what I'ma do is just keep 'em away without worryin about a thang
And you know my name, I'm not takin the blame, not playin the game
Evolution of elevation is way bigger than your big bang
Explain to me breath, explain to me breast, explain to me death mayne

[Bizzy Bone]
Heaven is high, how you doin as I'm walkin by
I've been in the blurry of war, and enemies ain't talkin right
I don't have the time, ain't a speck of no love up in here
Allah, I pray you forgive me for closin my eyes and ears
Nobody wanna tell the truth, huh? (Shh) Nobody is real
Everybody tryin to cover up, what's already revealed
Why am I tortured just for tellin the way it really is?
No questions asked, I'ma pass, I don't want none of yo' ass
I don't need leaf that or fig, I could walk around here naked
No I'm not Mr. Shakur, I'm so secure in the Matrix
I'm bakin up in this blanket, yo' fire is +Child's Play+
Chucky I'll stomp you to pieces and take him out my way
We prayin like every day, see you at the +Crossroads+
I'm gonna miss everybody, cryin for the lost souls
Horses, fire and crossbows, the righteous that lost those
My titans in cornrows, ignite 'em and turn slow 

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Bizzy]
Now what I want you to do right here man is
I want you to flip it like you used to flip it way way back in the days
Man we gotta get back to that man, youknowhatI'msayin?
'Member, right before you had cut yo' hair?
Man I want you to flip it on 'em baby, aight, cool

[Bizzy Bone]
Generals sit at the desk, and please pay attention we sellin our sales in unison
And inform in the midst of the moment if you would name everything that we was doin and
See heaven is high, now get with the real, we studyin Islam people
We walkin alone, without any help, and duckin like every evil
Is there anything that you want me to tell you?
Are you learnin anything new on this internet?
But now you've got somethin that you can come listen to
give in the real on these politics
It's more and more obvious that we're oblivious to any negative thinkin
Plus we are the warriors, slaves of Allah, without any negative drinkin
You know what I mean, no need to go further and further the burner is serious
We keep to ourselves with nobody else around to make us delirious
Vicarious, sloppy jalopy you driven, we're movin like militant soldiers
Now what do you feel when all the receptions are goin around your shoulders
Rocks are bigger than boulders, whether it's Colorado or if it's California
The haters are demon; it's lookin for war not rocks when they runnin up on us
It's so many jealousies they'll never win
They'll only be mad cause we back y'all
And there ain't no need for me to worry, Allah-u Akbar, yeah</pre>
