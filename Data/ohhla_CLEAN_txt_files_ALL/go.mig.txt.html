Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
My whip ain't equipped with butterfly doors
Stereo may not even play your CD
And the rims ain't gonna spin when we stop babe
But I swear we'll get where we wanna be

[Pre Hook]
Cus I just wanna be with you (be with you)
And I don't care what they say
We can run to the sun and forget this place
Where they'll only tear us down if we stay

[Chorus]
So let's go! Baby hop in!
Let's smash, hit the gas no stoppin
To a place where our love can run free..
Tank full of gas, pocket full of cash
Windows down and radio on blast
Baby just you and me. Baby just you and me

Hey. Baby just you and me

[Verse 2]
I understand that my plan ain't perfect babe
I don't know where we'll go. I don't care
Cus, just as long as we're together I don't ever have to worry bout a thing
Cus I'm sure that our love can get us there

[Pre Hook]
Cus I just wanna be with you (be with you)
And I don't care what they say
We can run to the sun and forget this place
Where they'll only tear us down if we stay

[Chorus]
So let's go! Baby hop in!
Let's smash, hit the gas no stoppin
To a place where our love can run free..
Tank full of gas, pocket full of cash
Windows down and radio on blast
Baby just you and me. Baby just you and me

[Bridge]
And if they ask we won't say a word
We'll speed off and laugh as we flip the bird
I don't give a damn, they don't understand
Baby take my hand and don't look back..

[Chorus]
So let's go! Baby hop in!
Let's smash, hit the gas no stoppin
To a place where our love can run free
Tank full of gas, pocket full of cash
Windows down and radio on blast
Baby just you and me. Baby just you and me
