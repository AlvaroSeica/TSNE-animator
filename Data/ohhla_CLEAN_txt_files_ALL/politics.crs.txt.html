[Ludacris]
Yeah
Okay, okay
Luda!

Hey... I'm back on it
like I just signed my record deal, yeah the best is here
The Bentley Coupe paint is drippin wet, it got sex appeal
Never shoulda hated, you never shoulda doubted him
With a slot in the President's iPod, Obama shouted him
Said I handled my biz and I'm one of his favorite rappers
Well give Luda a special pardon if I'm ever in the slammer
Better yet put me in office, make me a Vice President
Hillary hated on you so that bitch is irrelevant
Now Jesse talkin slick and apologizin for WHAT~?!
If you said it then you MEANT it how you want it, head or gut
And all you other politicians tryin to hate on my man
Watch us win majority vote in every STATE on my man
You cain't stop what's 'bout to happen, we 'bout to make history
The first black President it's destined and it's meant to be
The threats ain't fazin us, the nooses or the jokes
Get off your ass black people it's time to get out and vote
Paint the White House black and I'm sure that's got 'em terrified
McCain don't belong in ANY chair unless he's paralyzed
Yeah I said it cause Bush is mentally handicapped
Ball up all of his speeches and just throw 'em like candy wraps
Cause what you talkin I hear nothin even relevant
And you the worst of all 43 Presidents
Get out and vote, or the end'll be near
And the world is ready for change cause Obama is here

YEAHHH! Cause Obama is here
The world is ready for change cause Obama is here
Yeahhhh, cause Obama is here
Say world is ready for change cause Obama is here
Hey!</pre>
