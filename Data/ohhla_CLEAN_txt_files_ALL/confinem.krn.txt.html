"K-Rino; you'll be held in solitary confinement, until further notice"

[K-Rino]
Minutes after I received my sentence
I was then sent to the threshold of a corridor's entrance
Forced into an hellish existence
I went from intense pain then commenced to seek instant repentance
My hand served as a surveyor, with no light I'm sightless
I stand beneath darknesses third layer
Imprisoned as a punishment not receiving a fate
In a place so desolate prayers can't even escape
The reason I was here was never communicated clear
Two minutes in this place appeared like I had waited years
When the lights came on I was bathing in bladed tears
Cuz the room had commandeer all of my greatest fears
This ain't Hades cuz it ain't hot and I don't see devils
I saw three different escalators that lead to three levels
I stepped on the first one making sure to be careful
Saw fluid filled lines on the walls that looked like blood vessels
That first floor was called 'Confessional'
For 24 hours straight they questioned and pressured you to express the truth
Everything I did, every evil act was tracked on a sheet of black
Stones I had to reenact than read it back
Painfully I suffered as I heard people applaud
I saw every face of every individual that I scarred
Childhood to teenage to adult years
Each women that ever shed tears over me vindictively appeared
Who I hurt bad despite them loving me
And left them to suffer without the slightest concern for their recovery
I looked at all the people that I dissed
Beg the tortured deceased and insist
Couldn't leave they had shackled my feet and my wrist
Then I was given a proposition to go to the next level or stay in this condition
My selection was to move on not realizing 
That the second level was twice as painful and traumatizing
From the moment I put one foot on the next floor
I became sick to my stomach, disgusted by what I saw
People who needed me in life that I chose to ignore
Stood before me with intentions to even up the score
One of them said "Do you remember me?"
I'm the homeless man that you didn't feed
You passed right by me in my time of need
Said "Please" but ended up receiving no love
You was leaving the club, judged me and accused me of being on drugs
But you didn't know that I was a celestial
Angel on the Earthly quest to morally test you
You left and the thought never revisited or stressed you
That one great gesture without question would of blessed you
So now you'll feel the pain of those you never said "Yes" to
For seven years straight like they did with no rescue
The horror in the field without letter will infest you
The cycle will repeat itself eternally unless you...
Decide to go to the final stage
But its your last one, after this there's no turning the page
I said "Let's go" with no idea where I would be sent
Knowing this was it, back to the escalator I went
The last and worst floor was deep as the Earth's core
I was more nervous than the first whore to walk inside a Church door
I was instructed to sit by a wall with two slits
Approximately one inch in length, one inch in width
When they opened up somebody said "Look inside"
I was so petrified I asked if I could decline instead denied
Chance to survive was put in doubt
I passively looked in and realized that I was really looking out
I saw trees, sunlight and I rose up
Soon as a glimmer of hope expose itself the slits closed up
Once again I became mindful of my situation
The same voice said look behind you
And when I did it was such a burden
To see every person from the first two levels on the third one
I knew then I messed up, and should of chose better
Instead of one of the time I had to face it all together
How long will I be in this place? Please tell me
Claustrophobic in a small cell where they held me
A voice said just think and rewind
The whole time you was subconsciously confined in a guilt of your own mind
And these two slits are your eyes
So understand if you continue to persecute these thoughts will stay in you
But sometimes had to teach you
We had no authority over your brain; you contain the power to release you</pre>
