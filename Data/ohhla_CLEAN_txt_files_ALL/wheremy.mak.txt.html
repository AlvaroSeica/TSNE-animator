[Intro: Makeba Mooncycle]
Can I go? Can I go?
Can I give? Can I tell?
Can I help?

[Chorus: Makeba Mooncycle]
I wanna go where the people go
I wanna tell what they should know
I wanna give like all one day
I wanna help the souls get saved

[Makeba Mooncycle]
So make me laugh as I look down my path
Blinded by the lies of time, continue to rhyme
Continue to teach, continue to love, continue to reach
Continue to buzz, continue to peak
Flow soft like a creek, only two feet deep
These whispered warnings, your nature's calling
Feel my protection from all directions
Feel the power, wanna stop your stressing
Open up your mind, time is moving faster and faster
I move through the seasons, and almost couldn't capture
Everybody is not that nice
Not so neat, I'm not that far, from his reach
Valleys in the streets, some circle and cease
No more beef, no more grief
I wonder if together we rise, together we die
Together we cry, together we lie
Cuz I give protection to keep you warm
In a cloudy storm, you know the battle rages on and on
You know the battle rages on and on...
And I continue

[Chorus 2X]

*instrumental*
