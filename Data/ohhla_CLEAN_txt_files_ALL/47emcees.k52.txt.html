[KJ-52]
Let me busta a rhyme tell a story like Slick Rick
and put a sermon like eric in ya ear like a Q-Tip
now it's common sense that Ja Rules
but I'm a tell you about Jesus who's the leader of the new school
you thinking you's cool you emcees is lost boys
got no cash money you juvenile like some hot boys
I drop noise when I let the sound blast
and tell Big Boy Andre about Jesus Christ the outcast
here's the deal I feel it's now time to B Real
Christ died on Calvary not on Cypress Hill
it don't matter even if your slim or if your shady
JayHova reigns supreme but his name aint' Jay z
and it's mos def that the Mobb was deep
that hung the Son of Man who died just to bring back the lost sheep
on all streets all peeps naughty by nature
whether you biggie or small you can know the living Savior now..

[OLD SCHOOL]
Let me take you back to the old school
and tell you about the Fresh Prince of Peace now who just cold rules
we keep it nice and smooth Rakim like Eric B
and run "D" emcees to show our biz like AG
see I'm down with two live crews full of fat boys
and even though we young emcees now we can't avoid
the one who everlasts reigns as the lamb slain
just for you and I Jesus went to the House of Pain
you can be the Black Sheep but Christ reigns supreme
drink ya Ice T with some vanilla Ice Cream
don't matter to me be the Public Enemy
he'll still make your sin disappear like he's Whodini
in this biz I put his name on the Markie
that's why I'm calling out these names when I emcee

[DIRTY SOUTH]
check it now you can bounce with me
no limit to my God like Master P
what audacity it's quite ludacris actually
to think you could trick your daddy
God the father sees everything naturally
you can't fool him I'm like woah nelly
he'll put bone thugs back in harmony
it ain't hard to see just what he's done for me
I knew a guy named Bubba who'd spark the place
he was little like Wayne and had a scarface
but now this cat done changed his ways
talking how he's saved from amazing grace
understand that Christ had to "C"-Murder
so you and I when we die live forever
east south or old school flavor
47 emcees is how I hit ya</pre>
