[Hook]
Eyes feel so heavy, my guess
He feels these anvils on his eyelids
To find that stress relief
I bet he'll kill that need to achieve that final fix
That means we cease to eat
That means we cease to breathe
That means we see defeat
That means we need these feet to flee the scene
But there ain't no escape
That's why you stay awake, can't sleep

[Verse 1]
And he's got super senses
Like Marlon Wayans of Senseless
So sensitive, affected by the past and the present
Like Vietnam vets on Grand Prix day
Hearin jet engines, nerve end-ins
Stretchin towards that button of panic
He can hear the road tall amongst the bustle of traffic
He smells havoc, got a taste for vengeance
But it ain't quite as sweet as revenge is
The neglected, disconnected
So desperate, walk around headless
Tryna find some lunch in that breakfast
Gotta give credit where credit is due
So ahead and let loose, cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Tempted to swallow those sleepin pills
Cause the size of his shoes, his feet no longer fill
It's Johannesburg, when in Notting Hill
Got a shop with invaluable stock
But they got to rob the till, pop the pills
We sit and watch the monsters kill
She still hasn't lost the feel, maybe we lost appeal
Twenty-four hour clock, won't stop and chill
He's pot in the kiln that went crack
The plot in the film that went bank-rupt
Must be mad love to stand up and abandon a Samsung
Look what man done, must be ran-dom
Hands up dancin on that pile of shit
Got more than that in this life we live
Provided with the fight of a bitch
Wide eyes in this... huh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So, careful what you say to him
Don't know how much he's takin in
Go straight to the heart and it breaks the skin
If he got a dollar for every sacred sin - FUCK!
He probably would've made a mint
These days that trust comes paper-thin
Tear it up and chuck it in a cake tin
Draining his face in a ba-sin
Shakin the latency, complacency
In a worry, the blatant vacancy
In hungry, how you gonna make it comfy?
Misery loves company, come run with he
The apprentice got a message - don't fuck with me
Sleep deprived, shuteye is a luxury
From Melbourne to Tuscany, none of this love is free

[Bridge] {X4} (2nd time muffled)
Aiyyo God, Buddah, Allah - I don't even know your name
So how am I supposed to pass the blame?</pre>
