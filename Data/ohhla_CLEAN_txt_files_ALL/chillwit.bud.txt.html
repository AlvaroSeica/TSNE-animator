[Intro: Buddha Monk]
Oh, oh, oh, don't get it twisted girl
Ooh yeah, alright, alright, the feeling, you know
Oh... it seems like you can't feel me back though
I wanna chill with you, I wanna chill with you
Chill with you, chill with you, come on, let's go

[Chorus: Buddha Monk]
Hey girl, I wanna chill with you
Don't want nobody else cuz I'm feelin' you
Drinks at ya bar, holding you close
I'm chillin' with this girl, that I love the most
And I don't care what your friends say
They don't want you happy, so a lie, the'll say
Hook you up with a guy named Ray
Break up a home, why it be that way?

[Buddha Monk]
Look ma, I got something to say, when I met you boo
It was all about me and you
Not you and the crew, all the lies they told to you
It was, long trips, long kiss, long drinks
Now it's, small biz, that boy ain't shit
Here grease my hair, wake me up at six
I'm playing myself, but the horse is hard as hell
While you sitting on the phone, say I'm sitting right here, oh well
It's a ladies world, we got a baby girl
And what you show to them will be the same damn world
You think you cute, but the way you dissin' me
When I came to this life, to give you what you need
A man who cares, a man who's here
When nobody's there, just you and your fears
This the thanks I get, shoved in a corner
With a bottle of Hennessey and a hard ass dick
Nah, this can't be love and affection, hug &amp; love lessons
Rug burns and club dances
Chillin' with my girl, whether it's the movies
Walkin' in the sand, in the park holding hand
Damn, I'm the best man, that feels like the worst man
From the way you treating me, talking to your friends
Stella got her groove back, and I got the loose wrap
What you need on your way up, is me on your way back, belive that

[Chorus]

[Buddha Monk]
Look, I wanna chill with you, live my life with you
Fifty/fifty love, not a footstool for you
Practice snow white, dressed up in the finest
House, car, and your own ounce
You say money can't buy you love, but it sure do
Ex out the way you give another man your love
It's the root of all evil, and if you don't got it
Then believe me, the next man is poppin'
See what I came from is love the one you with, cuz
Other guys out there only givin' a mouth full of ----
Promise you won't love right, but after sex it's one night
Now you sittin' there wondering, can't you have another sight
But you gave it up for one night of minutes of pleasure
Now you kick back to the hood, to whoever, no tell me
Do you know him? He's that guy that loved you in the deep
The kind of guy who'll give you anything
Now, he's the guy, crazy for the things you did
Still got love and helped you raise your kids
But don't think it's time for weakness
He may love you with all his heart, but don't know how to eat this
You should of loved him when you had a chance
Love him when you got mad, never enough not to give up ass
But you better do what you gotta do
Cause even though it looks bad, remember he just wanted to chill with you

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
