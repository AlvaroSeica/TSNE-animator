Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm picture me rollin, takin you home
All eyes on me, drink, takin a toast
Said everybody with me at the side of the road
It's me against the world but I'm never alone
In the streets, I be never at home
Homie, don't you get that wrong
Hoe please don't touch my phone
When the thirstiest rap start pourin Patrone
Somebody get a bottle in here
Celebratin like we just hit the lottery man
Put that on everything, by the top of the year
I'll be on top of my game and probably top of yo bitch
Tell me

[Pre-Hook]
Lookin at me rollin on this
You know what the time is, you know what the time is
Go ahead and picture a Rollie on my hand
You know what the time is, you know what the time is
Goin at it

[Chorus]
Picture me rollin (rollin rollin rollin rollin)
Go ahead and picture me rollin
Picture me rollin (rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin)
Picture me rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin
Go ahead and picture me rollin rollin rollin

[Verse 2]
I be thinkin I'm old not giving a fuck
Charge me with assault, I'm hittin the blunt
Never droppin em down, I'm just pickin em up
We ain't gotta go home, just getting a chop
Just might get you in trouble
Whole team in here, no need for the huddle
One hop, two man, I just touched down
In the city with you but you ever come round my way
Holler at yo boy for the loud
I'm down for the pound, put it on for the town
With your goons for the night, I ain't worried for the height
Ya'll ain't killin these niggas, gon follow the light

[Pre-Hook]
Lookin at me rollin on this
You know what the time is, you know what the time is
Go ahead and picture a Rollie on my hand
You know what the time is, you know what the time is
Goin at it

[Chorus]
Picture me rollin (rollin rollin rollin rollin)
Go ahead and picture me rollin
Picture me rollin (rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin)
Picture me rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin
Go ahead and picture me rollin rollin rollin

[Verse 3]
I said you better get yo call there
Try and get everybody high off a contact
Fresh motherfucker, clothes ain't hit the floor yea
I don't even wanna leave my jacket in the cold chyeah
Hands round a bad bitch waist like a corset
Shawty wanna ride, she my lil red corvette
Picture me rollin, paintin the sky red
Lost my mind, where the time went? Wildin

[Chorus]
Picture me rollin (rollin rollin rollin rollin)
Go ahead and picture me rollin
Picture me rollin (rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin)
Picture me rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin
Go ahead and picture me rollin rollin rollin</pre>
