(Smoov-E)
But see they all the same
Girls use panties
Hoes wear strings
Some use nothin, but see they all the same
Hoes use G-strings, girls wear panties
Some wear nothin and lie to they family
See playas like me, smoke the weed
And get high, so saucily
Playas like Who? Don't talk playas that do
Who know how to work the draws
Right off you
She had large backseats, pearl white teeth
She told me it was cool if I felt underneath
The car had beat, situation went sour
I'm not gettin' close, and its almost been an hour
Girls use panties, pretty in pink
She took em' off and asked what do you think?
Well preferably, I like a string, but when you wear nothin
It's all the same
I met girls who are sweet and wear mens boxers
But behind closed doors, they flirt with they doctors
She picked up my package, like UPS
Thinkin' dirty thoughts in a wedding dress
See girls wear panties and hoes use strings
And some use nothin' to me they all the same
It's like hoes use G-strings, girls wear panties
And some wear nothin, and lie to they family
He wore tight black gloves
He smoked rope in the tub
He was hard to budge when you called a grudge
Picture him in a seat, wrapped in leather
Smokin in the studio, pullin' it together
Girls still ask, what makes me tick?
What do I like? And who I hang with?
Blunt on my lip, Nikes on my feet
Hittin' the hash, rappin' with Reek
Hoes use strings, soft to the touch
And others wear panties that don't fuck too much
Some wear nothin, like a model on the run way
But gettin' dug, from Monday to Sunday
Girls get high, tore, and tangy
Get they hand in yo pocket and try to empty your bank
But Lisa, let me hold your visa
I know you got a man, I just wanna tease ya
Girls use panties
Hoes use strings
Some use nothin, but see they all the same
It's like hoes use G-strings
Girls wear panties
Some wear nothin and lie to they family
21 years young, its just begun
Catch me at the bar, see how the coke hit me with the rum
Some girls are sweet and some girls are silky
Some got perfect ass and others fat and tacky
Some drive slow, some drive crazy
Some get (?) and tell yo lady
What's up girl? drinkin' cream soda
In a tight tennis skirt, like Kournikova
She jumped in the pages, of a magazine
I was at Texaco, pumpin gasoline
She had pulled up, slammin' $horty the pimp
In a all white car, with an all around tint
She stopped me said I like your Calvin Klein
Said you ain't seen nothin
Till you see me rhyme
I could tell, by the change in expression
 I was about to reap the benefits
Of my Profession
Girls use panties
Hoes use strings
Some use nothin but see they all the same
It's like hoes use G-strings
Girls use panties
Some wear nothin and lie to they families</pre>
