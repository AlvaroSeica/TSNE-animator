[V1 - Buckshot]
We started out... tight, on some white smiles
Ultrabright, it was worth the fight
Remember you used to talk, on the boardwalk
Signing our names in chalk, gave kisses in parks
Now it's missing the spark, can't light the flame
Ain't quite the same, that's life in the game
Ain't really liking the fame, but I deal with it, on the low
You the only reason I'm still with it, I gotta blow
See a long time ago, I made the promise
To buy you diamonds to hold you down ma but to be honest
I know I coulda called you more
Even though my niggaz hustlin' in Baltimore
I call you call, you call I call
But, I ain't callin no more, call a U-Haul
'cause you off

[V2 - Sean Price]
Clit lickin'... big dick stickin'
Shorty rob all the stock outfit from Dick and
I'll rip the fifth and
I ain't playin' witcha paw
Leave ya shit split and take a quick trip to Wichita
Bitches saw Sean on the TV screen
Said the nigga look good but he still seem mean
Bitches thinkin I'm a basket case
You can ask Yvette, shoulda bought the bitch a bassinet
I'm giving you dick, I'm living in debt
You giving me lip, riffin' by the living room set
Might smack off half of ya face
Type wild, quite foul, rip ya eyebrows with masking tape
I don't care no more
Ike Turner with the .44 that'll lay her f'sho

[bridge]
Keep walking, keep moving
You can fall, back bitch is not all that

[V3 - Sean Price &amp; Buckshot]
[Sean Price]
We went from run, catch &amp; kiss to some blunt passing shit
Now I hunt that, front back, dump that &amp; split
Started out cool.. Betsy had pool
Dunks in the water get ya, trunks off my daughter
Pardon me miss, I couldn't resist
Slim waist, fat ass and them C-cup tits
You wanna see where'm from flip? shit
You wanna see rough dick?

[Buckshot]
First you said all you want is love &amp; affection
Now you wanna show thug a lil' respect when
The question that I have for you
Why you love the dude that have to do, lemme ask you
Suppose I was in the back of that Rolls &amp; my lap wasn't rose
For a chick named Rose &amp; I really was supposed..
See, ain't no owning me
You off now, you can cross the street

[bridge x2]
Keep walking, keep running
Think you can shake us, another thing coming
You ain't really all that
You can fall back (fall back), now don't call back</pre>
