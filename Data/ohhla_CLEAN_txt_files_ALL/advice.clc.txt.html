Yo check it out, knahwhat I'm saying?
It's time to get a real low down
About how it goes, knahwhat I'm saying?
Ain't no need to beat around the bush
So uhh, just check out these playas
Pop it like this

Verse 1: WildStyle

You like this hoe
I bump this hoe
She be turning tricks man
Let me show you how to play your way
Up in this pimpin' game
Tell ya this from the get go
If I catch ya with another brother
You just gone be hurting fast
Hittin' wid why?
Don't you cry?
But bitch you out there bad
Get what you can, understand
I got another plan
Try to wreck shop and spit it fast
Pass a bag as I tag dag
Now I'm fin' to go for first scullie man
I'm mannish, dirty shouldn't hurt me
Why the foul niggas always wanna serve me?
Who gives a fuck they be like me
Never let no motherfucker spook me
Like I'ma goofy,
I'm down in this town so slick
And I want that coochie
I'm blazing up,
Come in all, rodeo
When we go
A pimp is a pimp
And a hoe is a hoe
Nigga let that shit go

Hook:

Here's a little something
That I think ya'll should know
A pimp is a pimp
A mack is a mack
A hoe is a hoe

When you on the street
You got to let that shit roll
A pimp is a pimp
A mack is a mack
A hoe is a hoe

Verse 2: Cold Hard

I'm just a slick nigga anyway
Being bogus to a bitch is how I'm raised
Ain't no sense trying to get in this
If you broke hoe get up out my face
"You a trip!" , No I ain't no trip
Watch my pimpin' in the future bitch
Hoe trying to play these mind games
Like these trick lames get these bitches rich
Uhh, guess who ain't tripping bitch?
For the shit you be trying to pull slick
I'ma stand on ya ass fast and pass
Watch me hit another lick
Hoe I ain't bout that groupie shit
I'm gon' come out squeaky clean
Have you ever seen,
When a man fiend,
Cause he ain't got no damn green
Square figmonts and marry them hoes
Fake Tims and paying 'em jealousy flaring 'em
Just cause a nigga be wearin' and tearin' 'em
Big thick I wannabes I must be scaring 'em
Got a bitch nigga wanna be my companion
To keep them hoes from all that bragging
But hell nah, it's Cold Hard
On the bitch I bogart

Hook

Verse 3: Never

Check it out,
You gotta pimp a bitch
Gotta put a bitch down on
How to go make that cash
Creep in slick, get up and dig
Then just straight break his ass
Cause it really don't make no sense
Just to get up wid a hoe
And she ain't gettin' paid
Bitch betta have my money laid
Down like a nigga strung out on hay
Hoes might try to strut man,
And pop game, back at a pimp
Real hoes know not to fuck wit me
Cause I really ain't down for the broke shit
Bitch wanna know how Never do it
Never did it, now that bitch wid me
Sticking her hands up in ya pockets
Giving me all your fucking profits
And it ain't no thing
I let a hoe know quickly she gotta go
When she getting to attracted to a nigga
Out on the stroll she can have that nigga
Bitch I'ma get my pockets bigga
Slow down throw down and pimp anotha hoe
Why fuck up the game trying to reclaim that bitch
Just let her go

Hook

Verse 4: Kilo

On the level pick a business
Never snooze on the game
Up out a freaky bitch
A pimp is a pimp ya'll
That'll find every vic
That's waiting cause it appears to be
A mack is a mack when I'm rolling
Bitches be riding that dick like a horsie
Giddy up wid it baby
Never loving no bitches
Giving me jones that can force me
Niggas turn to mack like us
Cause they getting played
At they own damned skin
Fall in love start fighting for that hoe
Trick or treating like it's halloween
If you can't see open up your eyes
And wake up cause you sleep on your knees
Cause I said it was a time when a no good hoe
You need to be getting rich
How you calling yourself a pimp
Boy you fucking up the game,
Scullies taking you off your square
You ain't a playa youz a lame
Don't push me just want the pussy
If you broke please don't tempt me
Kilo's on that hi-tech shit
A bitch will never pimp me
