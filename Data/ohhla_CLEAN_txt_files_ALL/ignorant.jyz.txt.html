[Jay-Z Speaking]
Y'all niggaz got me really confused out there
I make "Big Pimpin" or "Give it to Me" one of those
They held me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
I make some thought provokin' shit
Y'all question whether he fallin' off
I'ma really confuse y'all on this one..

[Verse One]
When them tops come down, chicks tops come down
When them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged then the 5th come out
Tough guy disappear then the bitch come out
"That's him," I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he wit' or his chip amount
'Cause I been doin' this since C*H*I*P*S was out
Watchin' Eric Estrada
Baggin' up at the Ramada, table full of powder
A.C. broke, 'bout to take another shower on my 25th hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game on the flight
You might see me anywhere, day in the life
Only thing changed is the tel' number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night

[Chorus]
I'm so bossy
Bitch, get off me, trick, get off me
You can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6s or Sprees
Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me

[Verse Two]
They're all actors, lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
Can't even face themself, don't fear no rappers
They're all, weirdos, DeNiros in practice
So, don't believe everything your earlobe captures
It's mostly backwards, unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song, you happen to see
Then, actually, believe half of what you see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
And with that said, I will kill niggaz dead
Cut niggaz short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K-I-DOUBLE-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell
Shoot niggaz straight through the E.R., whoa
This ain't B.R., no, this is S.C. CEO
The next Aaliyah; no, the next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel, yo..

[Chorus]
I'm so bossy
Bitch, get off me, trick, get off me
You can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6s or Sprees
Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me

[Bridge]
Excuse me, bitch, but fuck your name
Can I come? Gimme some brain
And when you're done, can you please get the fuck out?

[Verse Three]
I built the arch, mami, cry me a river
Blacken my heart by puttin' light liquor in the liver
Put my all in the part that spreads apart now I'm back together
Young Goldie, the mack forever
Heard they love it when I'm heard on hoes
Said a G don't give a bitch no cheese or security codes
I agree, my lady ain't no bitch, she gets whatever I own
So when you see her, understand that's me, nigga
Understand I'm the same OG, nigga
I know the difference between a bitch and a B, nigga

[Chorus]
I'm so bossy
Bitch, get off me, trick, get off me
You can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6s or Sprees
Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me

[Bridge]
Excuse me, bitch, but fuck your name
Can I come? Gimme some brain
And when you're done, can you please get the fuck out?</pre>
