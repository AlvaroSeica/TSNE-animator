Uh
It's hardly a secret
You ain't gonna stop trying get where you going until you reach it
Always had them bars back in the day
When the same ones runnin' up on you wasn't speaking
Look at all your achievements
You work hard so it would be kinda hard hard not to believe that
You party every weekend
Fuck 'em all who act like they ain't seen a thing
All them nights on the plane
losses of nigga it took, had to charge it to the game
Always wanted stardom and the fame
Learn to out smart 'em and now it,
Ain't no stopping this champagne from popping
The drawls from dropping, I'm seeing muscle cars and copin' 'em
Started off just a little less popular, yeah

[Chorus]
Now you got a new place, you drive a new car
You smile for the cameras, and life like a super star
Don't care what they say you reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed and thought about
And everyone knows who you are

[Wiz Khalifa]
Never gets boring, them haters in your face you just ignore them
Don't know what they talking shit for
See niggas get theirs you just trying to get yours
Therefore, you left all the people you cared for
Hopped on a plane, got airborne
Seen the bullshit coming and fell for it
But it's all good now 'cause the same ones who talk shit
Telling everyone you made it,
Then you start seeing hoes you dated
And thoughts start getting jaded
Now your life is sorta different, ain't it
Do your scars know what your pain it
But was it all worth, if it's painless
Say you wanna be famous

[Chorus]
Now you got a new place, you drive a new car
You smile for the cameras, and life like you're super star
Don't care what they say you reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed and thought about
And everyone knows who you are oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh who you are oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
oh, ooh, who you are, oh

[Wiz Khalifa]
I always knew I was this good
But never knew I'd be this good
Them niggas just startin I been doing it
Hear 'em talk but they ain't living my life
In the dark trying to get in my light
But chances I don't get them guys twice
Spending grands for hoes this is a highlight
And for them cameras posing this is the high life
Bottles raising for my niggas not here, I pour out a couple sips
Pour 'em out on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips
Them days I was younger I knew life was the shit but never like this
It's so amazing Will got it done, shots, we just pour and chase them
And worry about it cause they gonna hate, know where I'm going
Look where I came from

[Chorus]
Now you got a new place, you drive a new car
You smile for the cameras, and life like you're super star
Don't care what they say you reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed and thought about
And everyone knows who you are oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh who you are oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, ooh, who you are, oh</pre>
