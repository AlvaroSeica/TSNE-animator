Psalm 27 - lord is my light, my salvation
Lord shall I fear (lord fo'give Fo My Sins)
(I ain't cryin', I ain't Cryin') cause I have sinned
(the lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid)
And befo' I Wrap Up This +Port Of Miami+ (Please Lord, Please Lord)
(when the wicked, even mine enemies and foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh)
There's a lot of my brothers and sisters (they stumbled and fell)
They wasn't here to watch this come to pass
(though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear)
And since I can't do shit else, I'ma say a prayer (amen)
(though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident)
Amen

This was 12 years in the makin'
no side deals with Satan
I'm dealin' with the maker (straight up)
Alot of homies ask what's a prayer (What's a prayer?)
A prayer is what kept me focused 12 years (12 years!)
A prayer is what saved me - I should of been indicted
Now my kids know Jay-Z (Shawn Carter)
A prayer is what kept me here, when 'em bullets cut the air
I fell and I just said a prayer
A prayer's like medicine
it will heal wounds, ask bush veterans (just ask)
big holes in a nigga side
Snub-nose .45, homeboy just close ya eyes

Put ya hands togetha, bow ya heads
One, keep me alive
Two, keep me out the feds
Three, gotta bless the kids
Fo', One Fo' the fam
Five, fo' the Dividends
Dear lord, here I am

So, I repent my sins, fo'give me
One, the grapes on the plate
Two, the tags on they feet
Three, the nights mama cried
Fo, I'm Thuggin' with the fam
Five, fo the dividends
Dear lord, here I am (Ross)

I swear to god I done some thangs in the past
if I could, please lord, i'll Help You Bring 'em back (please lord!)
I feel pain mayn', Cuz I Can't speak On It (Shhh)
That's Why I Got So Many Songs, I Can't sleep homie (damn man.. damn!)
Tattoes fo' Fo'giveness (ces)
I might not git it, but fo'give Me (losses)
I'm Here And I'm fightin' like a motherfucker (motherfucker!)
Triple c's Excited like a motherfucker (triple C's)
Say a prayer, put the weed in the air
Thank god once again for makin me a millionaire (Amen Amen Amen!)
I thank god fo' makin' me a millionaire (Ross)

Put ya hands togetha, bow ya heads
One, keep me alive
Two, keep me out the feds
Three, gotta bless the kids
Fo', One Fo' the fam
Five, fo' the Dividends
Dear lord, here I am

So, I repent my sins, fo'give Me
One, the grapes on the plate
Two, the tags on they feet
Three, the nights mama cried
Fo, I'm thuggin' with the fam
Five, fo the dividends
Dear lord, here I am (Ross)

I used to git stacks of the ho zone (ho zone)
now back to back, covas fo' the Ozone (JB)
made the magazine, billboard goin' Stong
Rollin in the phantom, with motherfuckin Rolling Stones (Stones, nigga!)
You stuck with me thru thick and thin (thick and thin)
Sittin back, got ya mama sittin' in a benz (lord)
Make you damn near want to cry
low 95, stack money like homicide (homicide)
blood shed afta midnite (midnite)
It's just me and this weed, trynna git right (tryin' y'all..)
blood shed afta midnite (midnite)
It's just Ross and this kush trynna git right (tryin' to get right)

Put ya hands togetha, bow ya heads
One, keep me alive
Two, keep me out the feds
Three, gotta bless the kids
Fo', One Fo' the fam
Five, fo' the Dividends
Dear lord, here I am

So, I repent my sins, fo'give Me
One, the grapes on the plate
Two, the tags on they feet
Three, the nights mama cried
Fo, I'm Thuggin' with the fam
Five, fo the dividends
Dear lord, here I am (Ross)</pre>
