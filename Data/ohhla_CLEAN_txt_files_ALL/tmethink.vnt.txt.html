Song:   Time to Think
Typed by: sensative_new_age_guy@hotmail.com

Mortar shells is causing hell
Words rock and propel, dropping like water on your noggin in a Chinese torture cell
Thoughts as flawless, priceless
Poppin' the radio loud and join at death like silence
Mindless, poppin' the virus
Smuggling migrants as spies for the weapons that you harness
Assasinate em' like Tornts
Going against the Vents rough on your kids like divorce
Shifty like Oliver North
Enemies drink my piss like Poliver, this might bother ya
Midnight warrior choreographing horror
Seen the future - There's no tomorrow
Shut the mouths of doubt, just like Jimmy
Strap with a bomb up in the back like gimme
Too crocked to fuck, attitude suck
Hard To Kill, try and word em' up

Ah yeh, 2007
Another year, another pay check
Time to start thinking about who really running things
Who really telling you how to act
How to think, how to dress, what to eat, who to hate, who to love
Who's right, who's wrong, who's the enemy
Somebody talking different, looking different
or that man who's paying both your wages
Time to start thinking 'bout who really want you to get along with eachother
And who don't
Time to think about who's fucking killing your brain with that bullshit
Killing your body with that bullshit
That's why I stay hard to kill</pre>
