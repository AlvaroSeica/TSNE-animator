[Answering Machine Message]
Hey baby it's me, I know you're working hard at the studio
Just callin to let you know that I'm proud of you
And I can't wait to hear your new album
I better be the first one to get a copy of it
Love you, Bye.

[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, I aint ever feel this way in my life
About any woman, Look at my eyes ma
I'm tellin you the truth, Word up
You gone hold my hand, We gone do this, Yo

[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino]
Yo, If love is what you want from me
And I give it what would you do with it, Would you be true to it
I admit I have a problem with commitment
But we been datin for a while you throwin hints and I can sense it

[Dom Pachino]
Nice convo at first you cracked a smile
Kinda shy cutie pie, You is my type of gal
Carried yourself with respect that was your first check
Who would have thought we would have lasted this long when we first met
I mean, We spent numerous nights together
You held me, Closest through the trifest weather
You support what I do, Even though it's not for you
I don't have to worry about you cheatin cause I know that your true
My motto is I'm a man, I'ma do what I do
Your motto is I'm your man, I'ma do it with you
Your my serenity, Girl you keep me in check
I admit I have temptation and I'll never disrespect
Our bond, Cause love your the Nay in my Palm
Your this beautiful place that I'm on
Your voice is the smooth tone in my song
You keep me so right and I'ma never go wrong
You keep it so tight you outta sight in a thong
Incredible, A work of art, 
Want this to work don't want to hurt your heart
Your my Cinderella, Carmella, Carnella
This commitment has made me just one lucky fella

[Chorus]

[Dom Pachino]
She real nice on the eyes, Thick on the thighs
Glossy on her lips, Even her finger tips
Her hips quite exceptional, 
She got a head on her shoulders, Great convo very intellectual
Her skins been kissed by the sun
I admit her first kiss I was done
I had a problem on my hands, Is she the type of woman
That do somethin to her man aint that somethin
I aint frontin, I just couldn't understand
I got lost in her curls, 
Got a little tired and got lost in her girls, Things so soft in the world
She treat a nigga like a king, I aint gotta ask for a thing
I'm well that you care, Look at my smile
Other women want my number but I give nothin to dial
I need her all the time not just once in a while
Uhh, You hear me ma, I need you all the time not just once in a while

[Chorus]</pre>
