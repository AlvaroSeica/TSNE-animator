	Thinkin of a master plan, Skeme Team
	Let the track expand and attack the land
	Don't ever turn your back on those cats who scam
	Don't ever put your guard down and smack my hand

[Pumpkinhead]
I skeme from New York, to the land beyond
I skeme Girl Scouts (gimme that) for they candy bars
I could skeme a man in the desert for his last bottle of Evian
I burn champions like Tiger bombs
I could pick your pocket with the steadiness of pilot's arms
Whylin on suckers, who think I'm mild and calm
I'm like a silent alarm, the type to frighten your moms
Lightin the tralm, bitin my rhyme is like bitin a bomb
Pumpkin's tight like a dyke in a thong
I could even skeme a priest into liking this song
I'm like a thief in the night, I strike and I'm gone
Release on the mic that's tight in my palm, writin these songs
The con artist, bombardin areas uncharted
Pick out one target, leave him in his undergarments
Troopin through Brooklyn, stupid dumb retarded
Bloomin like a summer garden, you never see me like a bum in carpets
To spit what I spit you'd need a tongue enlargement
I'm comin chargin gunnin like a hundred seargeants
Skeme Team renaissance this, verbal calmness
On point like a compass, sheisty like Congress

	Skeme Team even when you know us you don't really know us
	You shouldn't trust us as far as you could throw us
	Always up to somethin so we see the top the fastest
	Don't put it past us, Skeme Team rock the masses (repeat all 2X)

[Block McLeod]
We skeme to leave lastin impression, attack as an act of aggression
Hack you to sections with a rusty blade so you can catch an infection
This track's a reflection of acts that had me back in detention
Reflected off cracked glass, and my backstabbin intentions
I'm that rap bastard that slapped maskin tape on fat hairy assed kids
You askin for trouble hardrocks, could blast you to rubble
like embassies in Africa then I laugh at ya and laugh at ya
Half of you don't even know that half of ya know the half like ?
I'm over your head I hover up other craftier breed
Your wife's in my bed on my level while you lookin after my seed
I went from last to the lead when I slash ya you bleed like hemophiliacs
I'm from Puetro Rico -- me no feelin that
So zip it, while I spit flows, burn you like a Zippo
Put you in a trance like a hypnotist, split domes like a schitzo
Tiptoe through your tulips, with two clips filled with bullets
And steal your Pulitzer, bust off a ? ? stompin it
And I'm troopin to Brooklyn got you lookin up at Jupiter when I'm scoopin
your leather wallet to fill my head with knowledge
on where you kept your dollars

	Thinkin of a master plan, Skeme Team
	Thinkin of a master plan, Skeme Team

	Skeme Team even when you know us you don't really know us
	You shouldn't trust us as far as you could throw us
	Always up to somethin so we see the top the fastest
	Don't put it past us, Skeme Team rock the masses (repeat all 2X)

[Metaphor]
Dispersing verbal chrome in your local nursing home
This verse is the perversest known to walk the earth's surface alone
without a purpose get your circus blown
I fill your palm with silicone and leave you cancer prone
I'm holdin friends in Rome with these hands alone
and turnin sands to stone (to stone) I'm stuck on girls like lancombe
I'll crush your collar bone, into little cobble stones
My raps, leave you broke like a thousand collage loans
I stomped your childish poems so my style is grown
I'm a mansion you a mobile home a dog without a bone
without ? on I rip apart your poem
I'm the sharpest rap artist known
Runnin nealothogic tones, steppin in my target zone
You bothered you get blown
I break you Down like Syndrome and nail you like an ingrown
I'm out this ozone, flyin on a sno cone, smokin homegrown
Blazin, in the outer space no smoke zone
Word A' Mouth, Skeme Team, it's engraved in a milestone
Grab your cell phone, we off the hook, hear the dialtone</pre>
