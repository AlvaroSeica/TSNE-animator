here we go again, I've been travelin'
here we go again, I've been travelin'

duffle bag, dragging pants, sagging ,never gave a fuck
bad manners, hustling the locals trying to get a buck
trying to get enough to eat, this drink might fill me up
saving up for a week to chief light indica
I'm on the map, if you on the map imma' visit ya
bring you a cd to bump with my signature
made you city style, putting down the godzilla foot
yeah, I've been around, in and out of town trivia
let me get your number and your address vivica
cause if you's a freak I'm a straight try to live with ya
I'll be back, if the ass is fat I'll remember ya
the dl is how we bail, just sell what I send to ya

here we go again, I've been travelin'
here we go again, I've been travelin'

subways to hostels, smoking bud with the rasta's
open up and tomorrow it's the same shit again
sleep on studio couches or a fat bitches houses
I stay there, she kicks me out, man the game never ends
bad news, fast food, every city I pass through
I'm always drunk and out of work, this album was pass due
ask who for what the fuck, I do what I have to
international, coach class, drinks by the glassful
stepping off the airliner showing my natural
just left your country, they should have made a statue
shimmy pass customs, wash my nuts in the bathroom
these bastards ain't fucking with these coca cola classics

here we go again, I've been travelin'
here we go again, I've been travelin'

ever since a youngster I was never known to sit still
in my case of life I make a pit stop to switch wills
this shit's real, bigger than your inner city day to day
cause nowadays an hour's pay ain't enough to pave the way
got me thinking like an action hero trying to save the day
far away from home, hoping all my problems fade away
drifting through shades of grey, living for the moment
I be walking down the street, not even knowing where I'm going
I'm a dog in the rain, I broke the chain on the gate
hopped the fence and I've never been the same every since

here we go again, I've been travelin'
HERE WE GO AGAIN, I'VE BEEN TRAVELIN' (X2)</pre>
