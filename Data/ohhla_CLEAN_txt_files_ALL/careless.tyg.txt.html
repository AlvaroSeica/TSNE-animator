[Intro]
I awoke from a dream
filled in a world full of greed and hate
The world was my thoughts, and surroundings
I realized I needed to rise, and become king
My own destiny

[Chorus]
Take a look around, tears from they eyes
Knees on the ground, money in the skyyyy
Take a look around, ain't shit nice?
Prayin for my life, hope I make it through the night

[Tyga]
(Take a look around) the city on fire
It's all takin place in the middle of my mind
I stand in the middle, cause death right beside
Murderin is simple, get your life simplified
Where the bones lie, rebuild another life
America's pie, put my hand in the pot
I can't get caught in the streets I was taught
Raised off anger but it wasn't my fault
Nigga take a look around, it's needles on the ground
Never gave three fucks, and I still don't now
I'm fuckin in the house, babysitter on the couch
13 like, "What this shit comin out?"
Pass me a jimmy, I ain't ready for a child
I hope nobody hears - bitch, why you so loud?
Turn on the tube, put my head on the cloud
Breathe, inhale, the angels can't help
Tyga, take a look around... take a look around

[Chorus]

Take a look around {*2X*}

[New Chorus]
(Take a look around) all night, fightin 'em for my life
Praying that everything gon' be right
(Take a look around) ain't it nice? Truth over the lies
Young knights, we kings in the skies
(Take a look around) I'm ridin around in my city
Bitches pictures up in they titties
Man you fake, all of us know it
I'm original and I show it

[Tyga]
Roll one time for everyone down and
t-two times for the nigga that bounce
Then why you sittin 'round on some couch shit
My-my money building like houses
(Ahh~!) Feelin like you wise
Truth be told, it's all lies
These the days of our lives
Why you wastin all of yo' times?
Voices from the skies said that evil fall in yo' rise
They judge me low to the dirt, then they celebratin my highs
Why you, why you wanna be fake? I fuckin hate you
Why you mad cause I ain't take you? Last day alive, I wouldn't even you
I'll replace you with somebody better that you only make up
We just make up, wake up king and queen and rule the world a little later
Later on in that day, tears all in her face
I said I'm goin away, she beggin me to stay
Took a look in her eyes, then she put my hands on her waist
Said "Don't leave, we've got a baby on the way"

[New Chorus]

[Tyga]
(Take a look around) I'm ridin around in my city
Bitches pictures up in they titties
Man you fake, all of us know it
I'm original and I show it
(Take a look around round round round round...)
Man you fake, all of us know it
(Take a look around round round round round...)
Make you fake, all of us know it...</pre>
