Artist: Gröûp X
Album:  40 Oz. Slushie
Song:   Don't Touch That
Typed by: ÇexyÇy

*This track is a parody of the MC Hammer song "U Can't Touch this"

*Between the verses and during the chorus there is meaningless scat rapping

Don't touch that
Don't touch that
Can't have it
Hands off
 
Schmy schmy schmy schmy 
Music hit me so good
Made me say Oh my God
Thank you for giving me 
A two hip rhyme and two hop feet
It feel good and I don't know what
But that's my hot dog and you can't touch
So get your hands off and you know what 
That's my hot dog, can't touch

Can't touch that
Hands off
Get away...bitch

Every time you see me, Hashmeer is in trouble
I like to chew gum and I like to blow a bubble
One time I blew a bubble so big
Inside of the bubble was a little hkid
Little kid come out and he says to me "Schwat?"
I said get your hands off my hot dog
That is something, can't touch
 
Don't touch that
Can't have it
Hands off
Put it down

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Go Hashmeer go, go Hashmeer go
Go Hashmeer go, go Hashmeer go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Go Hashmeer go, go Hashmeer go
Go Hashmeer go, go Hash-STOP!
Hashmeer time
 
Say what
Yeah yeah yeah
 
When I get tired I like to take a nap
And you say Group X steals a beat and that's bunch of crap
Why would we ever stop doing that?
'Cause Puff Daddy do it except he cannot rap
Been around the world from Chicago to Yew Nork
It's Hashmeer go, Hashmeer go, Hashmeer go, Hashmeer 
And the rest can go away, schwhat?
 
Don't touch that
Can't hhave it
I bomb your house, idiot
Go to town
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Go Hashmeer go, go Hashmeer go
Go Hashmeer go, go Hashmeer go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Go Hashmeer go, go Hashmeer go
Go Hash-STOP!
