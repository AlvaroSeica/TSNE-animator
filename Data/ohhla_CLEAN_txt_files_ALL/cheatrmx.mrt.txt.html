[Intro: Christopher Martin]
C Martin yah!!! Longside Jim Jones and lord have mercy
Hey! Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Hey! Yah!
It's not di first nor di last, mi see di pretty pretty girl dem just a pass
Oh lord! Holdin out it's such a task, Jim Jones come tell dem what a gwaan

[Verse One: Jim Jones]
Suppose to marry Juwana aka Mary Jane
But instead I got caught up and got married to the game
She use to hold me down when I was havin all my pain
But this white girl gave me brains when she had me in the range (DAMN)
In love with this white girl sum'n like Megan Fox
Trouble up in Hollywood thought our love would never stop (DAMN)
'Til I met this bitch Chyna White (Right) She remind me how the movies do
So I stepped to +Kill Bill+ like Lucy Liu (Get It)
She the bomb even bought me a coupe or two (BOOM)
She almost got me locked, I still fuck with her
Told me cop the drop I had bought the truck with her (CLEAN)
Started cheatin on her with the bitch that like threesomes
Now my ex even know we know she like threesomes (Nasty)
We in the party like three sum'n (What)
She said pick a bitch tonight it might be sum'n (Get her)
Turned two points to a trifecta
Solemnly swear I would never take a lie detector (WOO!!!)
If I recall she said her name was Molly (You sure?)
A.T.L. I think we met at Follies (I'm not sure)
Or maybe it's Miami down at K.O.D.
I mean a bitch will hit the shit will make a bitch O.D. (Slow down!!!)
Mary Jane all jealous she be talkin loud 
She a one hit or quit it bust it in the crowd

[Chorus: Christopher Martin]
Oh lord! Don't let me cheat on my girlfriend
'Cause as far as I can see, she loves only me
Oh lord! Don't let me cheat on my girlfriend (Please don't let me cheat)
But lord if you can't stop me from cheatin
Just don't let me get caught (No, No) Don't let me get caught (No No No No)
Don't let me get caught (Not at all!) I said I hope I don't get caught (Please don't mek she catch me lord!)

[Verse Two: Christopher Martin]
Yo I nuh lie mi a try
I love my baby but di girls dem still deh pon mi mind
(Wuy!) It's unfair I can't deny
'Cause I couldn't bare to tink about my lady on anodda guy (YUH MAD?!)
And yo it's hard yo it's hard yo it's hard!
Fi have one girl to kinda run fi play di part (OY!!!)
She would a left mi if she knew what's in my thoughts
I hope I don't ever pay that cost

[Chorus: Christopher Martin]
Oh lord! Don't let me cheat on my girlfriend (Please don't let me cheat!)
'Cause as far as I can see, she loves only me
Oh lord! Don't let me cheat on my girlfriend (Oh no!)
But lord if you can't stop me from cheatin
Just don't let me get caught (Never ever) Don't let me get caught (Ever Ever!)
Don't let me get caught (Now that she catch me!) I said I hope I don't get caught (Oh I dont!)

[Verse Three: Christopher Martin]
So listen to mi now! She seh bun she neva meant fi it
Fi get and can gi yuh straight crazyness
Uh Uh! And when mi siddung and mi mediate
Hot stress, caan mek she know seh she gettin it (YUH MAD!)
NOW! One girl to a man so we set in it (Set in it)
But fi we a one girl we keep forgettin it
Neva get caught yet we tink we mekin it
I hope we don't end up regrettin it

[Chorus: Christopher Martin]
Oh lord! Don't let me cheat on my girlfriend (Please don't let me cheat!)
'Cause as far as I can see, she loves only me
Oh lord! Don't let me cheat on my girlfriend 
But lord if you can't stop me from cheatin
Just don't let me get caught </pre>
