The Opening Soliloquy
As WE go against the river stream in the vision of the true and living KING
WE been afflicted by a sick Disease
But, the Remedy is right there in YOUR Face: WE the Missing Link
Yea, WE See YOU, In OUR periphery
Pick a Team. The Ruler's Eye on YOU like Ricky D
Amongst the prison themes and the land of the trigger squeeze
WE Stand like the Liberty Statue, physically

KING LEGEND
If YOU talkin bout WAR, WE gone make sure it's ONE when WE leave here
KING LEGEND
When it's ALL said and Done and the fat lady sung, WE gone be here

They said: "What YOU wanna be when YOU grow up?"
A LEGEND
Live like a KING or Die like a peasant
"What YOU wanna be when YOU grow up?"
A LEGEND
Live like a KING or Die like a peasant</pre>
