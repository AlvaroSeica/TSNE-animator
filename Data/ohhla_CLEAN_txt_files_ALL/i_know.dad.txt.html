[Intro] + (Diddy)
Aiyyo Wiz! {You already know}
Don't you ever leave (I see you Polow)
Don't you ever go away
I love you, I love you
I'm beggin you don't you leave
(Now why you wanna go and leave me babe?)
I'm beggin you don't you go (shit)
You've got my heart, you've got my heart
You've got my heart (you know you got me open, yeah)
(Check this out) I know I fucked up (I know I fucked up)
I know I fucked up (I know I fucked up)
I know I fucked up, yeahhh (I'm sorry baby)
Baby I need you (I need you) baby I need you
(Aiyyo check this out) Baby I need you baby, yeahhh

[Diddy]
But now you're gone
And I'm forced to deal with your absence
All alone in this madness
All alone on my mattress
Don't know how the hell did this happen
You knew lovin me was a hazard
Outcome of my actions
I wish we could go backwards
Go back a couple of chapters
Back when there was laughter
Back when we first met
Before we 'came such a disaster
Before your heart got shattered
Before I forgot how much you mattered
Crazy we don't realize what we have until after
we no longer have it, uh-uh, eh eh, uh-uh

[Chorus] + (Diddy)
Don't you ever leave (don't leave)
Don't you ever go away! Don't you leave, don't you go
I love you (I love you) I love you (I love you)
Yeahhh! I'm beggin you don't you leave (got me fucked up girl)
I'm beggin you don't you go (you know I can't live without you)
You've got my heart, you've got my heart (yeah)
You've got my heart (aiyyo Wiz)

[Wiz Khalifa]
You say you out the door, you out the door
You sick and tired can't take no more, can't take no more!
You know the game and tried to play it time and time befo'
Told me you don't got time to waste
so hey, you got to go, you got to go
Cant help of think of you when I'm alone
Tried and failed, I call your cell you don't pick up your phone
Guess that really means you meant just what you said, said just what you meant
Getting all this bread but it don't mean shit
Fuck the dough I get, plus the dough I spend
Darling just

[Chorus] + (Diddy) + [Wiz]
Don't you ever leave (don't leave baby)
Don't you ever go away {don't you ever go away}
[And throw it away]
I love you [Hear them people talkin 'bout us]
[Yeah them hoes all went away] I love you
[But this is all I can say] (I love you)
I'm beggin you, don't you leave - I'm beggin you baby
I'm beggin you, don't you go - don't you leave me
You've got my heart, you've got my heart
You've got my heart

[Chris Brown]
Hey superstar!
There's a raincloud above my heart
And it's only because of you
I knew it from the very start
But I'm not a complainer - no no~!
And that's the least of my problems today, but
You can have my heart I'll give it away, babe
And I'ma honor and cherish our play time, baby

[Chorus]
Don't you ever leave, don't you ever go away
I love you, I love you
I'm beggin you don't you leave - I'm beggin you baby
I'm beggin you don't you go
You've got my heart, you've got my heart
You've got my heart
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up
I know I fucked up, yeah
Baby I need you, baby I need you
Baby I need you, yeah
I'm beggin you don't you leave
I'm beggin you don't you go
You've got my heart, you've got my heart
You've got my heart

[Outro]
Yeahhhhhh
Aww no, no you do
Aww no, no you do
Yeahhhhh

[Diddy]
I love you</pre>
