[Frank Ocean]
Got a heart full of gold, that I own
The clothes on my back and a pant suit
I control my own money
You wouldn't even tell the difference
But I just can't sketch the feeling
I get when you're not home
Or recreate the paintings
You've hung onto my soul

[Chorus 1]
Oh, oh - but I bet they're worth millions
Oh-hooo beautiful works of love
Oh-hooo I'ma go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can't tell me nothing, nothing

[Chorus 2]
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain't got nothin but you
Nothin but you, nothin but you
They can't buy what I got
Cause I ain't got nothin but you
Nothin but you, nothin but you
I'm the richest man in the room {*3X*}
Ohhh

[Frank Ocean]
She got a heart made of glass
What's inside of this like hidden in a bottle
Now what would that be worth in your museum?
Recently we traded
And now that heart's my own
And since we're sewed together
I feel like I got both

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2] (minus "richest man in the world" line)

[Frank Ocean]
Time itself wants what I got
So I don't care about what you've got
All I know is my girl is special
You make me better, baby
You make me happy, baby
Nobody needs to remind me exactly why I'm
The richest man in the room

[Chorus 2] - 2X (first time minus "richest man in the world")</pre>
