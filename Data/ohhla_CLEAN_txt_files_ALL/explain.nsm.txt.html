Some-thing, I can't, ex-plain (*repeat 7X*)

[Smooth Bee]
I think I love her
but the Lord only knows if she's the one for me
My true Queen
I can't ask for more physical attraction
Baby girl is real hype
She says she wants to bear my child
Is it because I make hit records
or cause I'm a good lover?
I don't know, I guess I'm a little petrol
Together we do things that I've never done with anyone else
like eat ice cream together, sharing Chinese food
and of course entering each other, endlessly
You see, when I make love to my woman
I like to tear down walls and build new ones
I take her through multiple ecstasy
and this girlie insists that she's my match
My new love level
But I just can't front anymore
I can't feel it
So therefore I must carry on
Just take me to Love Court
cause Smooth Bee's not settling down
Call me a tramp, jiggalo, ho, et cetera
but my jimmy's not for sale
More than one woman's my motto
I'll never be caught stranded with a flat tire and no spare, word
Yeah right
In four more months, you'll be having our child
That's if you intend to have our child
And since we both made this commitment
which brings forth fruit through light
be like a strong tree, with strong roots
And like a strong limb, I'll never fall off
unless the sustainer of all living things, allows it
And I want you to remember baby, that I do love you
I really do

[Greg Nice]
I'm sorry baby, I'm so so sorry
I didn't mean to bruise your delicate flower-like emotions
Listen - I was on some hardcore illusion of what love really is
You know I used to put up a phony forcefield shield
and the whole nine yards
Keep my true feelings, locked deep inside a box
But when your love was so strong, so potent
it was too much for my heart at last
Guess I was somewhat immature, but I've grown up now
Baby you gotta take me back, I'm on the verge of self destruction
I never had a love like yours before
Remember our walks through the park, our cozy dinners for two?
Our exhange of love juices?  MMM-mmm!
Baby, don't throw 'em all away
The only reason I broke like I did, is because
I love - I mean, I couldn't react any other way
Just think - another man, sleepin in my bed
with the one I love?  Please, tch
I'm just too nice for that
Please baby, take some time, think about us, you and I, me and you
I'm sure you'll realize that I'm the one for you
I guess I'll say peace now, and remember baby
please remember, I'll always, and always, always, love you
See you!

Ooooh-ooooh-oooh

[D.J. Teddy Ted]
Baby, you don't love me anymore
I'm not sure you really did before
You see I couldn't see through your phony charms
Nothin really mattered when I took you in my arms
You see I found you so fascinatin
Oh baby so fascinatin
You see I thought you were the one for me
Found out you were nothin but a fantasy
You know, you left me standing lonely
Girl, you left me standing to cry
But yet you weren't woman enough to say goodbye
But there is, there is one thing I must thank you for
You taught me a lesson in life I'll never make the same mistake anymore</pre>
