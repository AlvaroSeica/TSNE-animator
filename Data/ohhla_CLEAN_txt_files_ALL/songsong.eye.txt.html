I just want a send a special, special thank you today
Anyone who donated a little of something in the collection can
God won't forget you

Now this next song is a song about writing this song
Now I'm not some profound visionary
But this specific incision didn't particularly take too long
I was just running up this back stage stairs
And suddenly it dawned to me
What a good idea, true inspiration
But with no pen or paper to record the creation
I aborted the plans of grand innovation
And stood bored pacing on the wood floor waiting for more wars to
Gore for my planning and
Maybe I'm not cut out for this writing game
I thought for a brief second
But then it was like the lightning hit through me in a complete head spin
And kept punching me with raising concepts rhyme patterns and song interruptions
With long floods that dropped fire struck until I was finally finished
And in a matter of minutes consciousness is linked with being inventive infinite
And one of my friends happened to have a pen
So I wrote it all down on my hand
That was that

Thank you
We're just gonna
Thank you thank you
We're just gonna pass the collection around one more time
Try to find it in your pockets and your hearts to donate all your money
God won't forget you</pre>
