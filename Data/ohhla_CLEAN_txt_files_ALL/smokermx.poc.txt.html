Chorus: Chiko Dateh
Come fly with me (Let's get fly)
Take a hit of mari (Let's get fly)
We huffin', huffin', huffin' (Let's get fly)
We puffin', puffin', puffin' (Let's get fly)
Come fly with me (Let's get fly)
Take a hit of mari (Let's get fly)
We huffin', huffin', huffin' (Let's get fly)
We puffin', puffin', puffin'

(Verse 1)
[Ese Daz]     Wouldn't you like to go with me
            On a peaceful journey
            Striken and smokin' with my lady
            When I meet her, I'm in paradise
            Silky brown skin with those sparkling green eyes
            Let's fly
            Let's go
            In and out, we in the zone
            Ignite the flame
            Get rid of my pain
            One on one
            Me and you
            Come on, mari, let's get it on
            I'm sprung and twisted, mentally gifted
            Your love's got me physically addicted
[El Fino]     Excuse me
            While I kiss the sky
            It's time to get high, with a little help from the F.L.Y.
            Take a hit of the Maui, Maui
            Get lit
            Grab mari by the hips, as she touches my lips
            She's like a doorknob
            Everybody gets a turn
            Stop
            Pass it to Johnny, let it burn
            Let it fly, consume your soul and be free
[Chiko Dateh] Get up, stand up, come fly with me

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Johnny D]
Sit back, relax and enjoy ya ride
We tell ya ways up N.Y.D., from Killer Cali, Spanish F.L.Y.
Got ya lifted, take grassy green feels in the sky
Don't trip
Everyday's a high night
With some
Model chicks and some fool in the mix
Bouncin' up and down to the latest F.L.Y. hits
Forget about your trouble, nobody burstin' bubbles
Everybody, form a huddle, we puffin' on that trouble
What

Break: Ese Daz
I huff and Puff like The Magic Dragon
Burning Down The House (One man standin')
You gotta get up, get out and light somethin'
Roll it up, light it up, get fly
You gotta get up, get out and light somethin'
Spanish F.L.Y., 310, when we ride
You gotta get up, get out and light somethin'
Like Cheech and Chong, we can all get fly
Let's go

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
[El Fino]     Kick off your shoes and relax your mind
[Chiko Dateh] Sittin' on top of the world
[El Fino]     On Cloud 9
            Like a star in the sky, lookin' down, watchin' time fly
            we spark it up like the 4th of July
            Come on in
            The door is open
            Puff, puff, give
            We got it smokin'
            It don't stop til the last ass drops
            Disturbin' the peace, and don't call the cops (Hey)
[Chiko Dateh] Come on, let's roll, let's ride, get fly
[Johnny D]    To the limit
            Grab a drink and step into my mind
            Picture this
            Then I pass it to the right of me
            Freaks be, jumpin' in the sack, to fly with me
            Drastic
            If I ain't got none in my system
            I had a chance, to get some fluffy, but I had to diss
[Chiko Dateh] So, just come fly with me
[Johnny D]    Daz
            Ace, Fino and Johnny D

Repeat Chorus

[Chiko Dateh]
Let's get fly
Let's get fly
Let's get fly
Let's get fly
Let's get fly
Let's get fly
Let's get fly</pre>
