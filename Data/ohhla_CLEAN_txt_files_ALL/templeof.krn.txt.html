Yo was up allow me to introduce myself
Exploration of deeper realms of thought into the black hole of my mentality
Merciless verses burn like acid when you battle me yeah
Temple of doom 4000 levels to consume

[K-Rino]
Step in the temple of doom
Lyrical levitator
Ligament lacerator
Legendary line learner
Might take your life later
Eulogy creator
Massacre maker
Voice slaved to health
Open my book by the light
Vocals laid theyself
I get positioned be rippin ya while ya wishin
Bustin nuts and listen
Flow through a collision like an apparition
Commence to rammin your thought pattern
And slammin ya doomin ya damnin ya
so let the mortician examine ya
my style is verbless
challangen me is perilous
street legend evolved into the most scariest therapist
words physician drama enhance the third power
radiation is caused by my potent nuclear word drama
you starin right into the glaring light
insomable flows it lights suckers at 300 degrees fahrenheit
measure my power might
murder reunite the manuscript
the ?? mad at your souls subtract 'em
I spit 'em send 'em
Signalize they be in 'em
Anatomy equipped to drink the five deadly venoms
The rest is history my fist will be swangin
so dope that one rope left 20 violators hangin

[Chorus]
Six million ways to die, choose one
if you can't take the heat get your face from in front of the gun
Six million ways to die, choose one
if you can't take the heat get your face from in front of the gun

Observe the spoken word
I amaze like science fiction
Whole populations suffer from massive homicide affliction
I burn 'em hard punch to the sternum
Cause I'm rattling lungs
Multilingual rapper able to battle in tongues
Prolific paragragh producer rough rocket scientist
Deep intellectual advanced vocabulary user
Highest level I rose passed it
Funeral bringer family members hearing moans from the closed casket
When its my turn cease the loud jokin
My microphone exuding poisonous gas that left the crowd choking
Witnesses fall when I get your verbal victims outnumbered
dockin supplies so its 20 bodies to a stretcher
Don't need no ganja to conjure
My styles are a step
My vocals vertically they reach 200 miles up
Mathematic melodious mind minutes
with mastery of metaphysics musical mirror
mad monologues religious
south park pioneer getting mine
went back in time to crack some rappers I forgot to bust in 89
temple left them in solitary confinement
emergency surgery whole body realignment

[Chorus]
Six million ways to die, choose one
if you can't take the heat get your face from in front of the gun
Six million ways to die, choose one
if you can't take the heat get your face from in front of the gun

Help is needed for the conceited
Imitators defeated
Lyrics lethally injected
Criminals die when they read it
Came out the womb after 12 months due to unfinished business
I was writin my first rhyme and couldn't leave until I was finished
So ice cold I freeze in the summer
The boomin trap creator
killer cop crucifier deep human calculator meditator
boy you don't know how slow you rock
trick I see the future so I might just holler come in right before you knock
extracurricular beat downs I'm kickin the worst
non perpendicular visions causing the victim to vomit
those who's poetic dread it follow the rapid threat
I'm gettin flashbacks of events that haven't happened yet
Criminolistic chronicles I create and criticize
legitimize battle strategy til he dies
cast him out rhymes cut his jugular slashed him out
mics bleedin to death rappers faintin and passin out
dialects sadistic terminal vocal teacher so twisted birthdate unlisted
proven K-Rino never existed
fool started gunnin so I satarted runnin at him
he was bustin but I kept on comin
I'm K-Rino extensions passin my sound all around
Doing push ups without touching the ground
I can break down each letter in my name if you want it
Killer rhymes intellectually nullifying opponents
K-Rino

[Chorus]
Six million ways to die, choose one
if you can't take the heat get your face from in front of the gun
Six million ways to die, choose one
if you can't take the heat get your face from in front of the gun

I'm flowin, I kick the kind of style that keep them hustlas rollin
I drop the kind of verse that keep the paper foldin
Them haters never seen the kind of heat I'm holdin
One lyric to his chest left his body swollen
I'm flowin I kick the kind of style that keep them hustlas rollin
I drop the kind of verse that keep the paper foldin
Them haters never seen the kind of heat I'm holdin
One lyric to his chest left his body swollen</pre>
