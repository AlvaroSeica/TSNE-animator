Song:   Wonderful Place

Yeah, uh huh, lets do it
Damn, it's setting in now
Cause cartoons are turning into real life
Lemons and limes are fighting
Fighting over straws like they were oil filled pipes
Why's the sun writing the song?
Why is this funny to me?
all of a sudden a mouths' come along
And what he sings, it brings harmony

You may not understand why there's a smile on my face
It's cause this world would be such a wonderful place
If some of these companies in two-thousand three get erased
But not me man, I see a wonderful place (the world's a wonderful place)

[chorus]
My soul's in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
My soul's in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
My soul's in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
The wallpapers movimy soul's in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up

The wallpaper's moving
My arms and my legs leave a blur when I swipe
Sap is just oozing
But trees say that smoke blocks the sun
So for them, it's just night

The seven eyes look in through the clouds
And why is that funny to me?
And here comes the mouse singing loud
And what he sings brings harmony

You may not understand why there's a smile on my face
It's cause this world would be such a wonderful place

[chorus] x2
