[Intro]
Ay! Man I'm pullin out the muh'fuckin Rich the other day
Man I pull up on my potnah Beano, knahmsayin? Real boss nigga
He like "Future - you deserve that shit nigga!"

[Chorus]
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, Future, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, Future, you deserve it
I done paid so many dues, I never lose my cool
Just the other day, my lil' cousin call me from school and said
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, Future, you deserve it (turn it up)

[Future]
Ain't asked for this, I worked for this
I was in the Dungeon just purchasin
Catchin Jenkins, not payin attention
Knowin how I'm livin, my slang tremendous
I'm better than you - and I know it, I will show it
You ain't flowin how I'm flowin, that's why I'm goin
Places you ain't goin, I'ma keep goin, and goin
and then I'm flowin, to another
My come up is explosive, I picked that up from Rico
I cousin had my back from day one, mano y mano
I believe in keepin it one thousand, and stayin humble
New route I chose to take through the jungle
Keep the same mentality when I was standin on the corner
Hit the studio and spit that crack and have you on it
(My folks done told me)

[Chorus]

[Future]
I go so fuckin hard until my heart skip a beat
I always been expensive, ain't nuttin about me cheap
I'm the realest nigga you have seen, since Michael Jackson "Billie Jean"
All this pain I can't even rap it, sometimes I feel I wanna sing
My passion (my passion) it goes without me sayin
The fruits of my labor I laid down a solid foundation
You water a seed too long, and it'll growm
You stay down and grind for long, and it's gon' show
It brings water to my eyes, just to hear me on the radio
You wouldn't understand the route I had to take to get here so
I worked for this (I worked for this) it didn't come easy (it didn't come easy) 
Most people hit me up and say these rappers cheesy, cuz

[Chorus]</pre>
