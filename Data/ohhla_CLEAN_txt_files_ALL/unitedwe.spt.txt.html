[Verse 1]
Let me set aside these lyrical gimmicks and these profanities
Make sure you're understanding me, before I lose my sanity
I made a decision, on a mission for my humanity
Cause children are living with illusions of wealth and vanity
Blind to the truth, the youth live in hypocrisy
Governed by a bureaucracy you call democracy
Shrouded in political drivel, evil philosophies
Existing since the birth of religious and holy prophecies
Total global monopoly, all controlled privately
By ancient royalty and satanic secret societies
Feeding off our fears and our worries and our anxieties
Illuminati risen they're driven to kill us quietly
Open your eyes and mind, see what I can see
Because the eyes on the pyramid staring at you and me
They'd rather see us all bleed to death than set us free
Trapped in a cell called hell and the devil's the one that has the key
Its blasphemy they're after me, I'm ready for the danger
Kicking in the door and we taking what we came for
Clip through the grip and a bullet through the chamber
I'm letting off rounds with unapologetic anger

[Chorus:]
United we stand, divided we fall when we ride
It's the way that we living, the way that we feeling inside
You can try to take our lives but you can never take our pride
No fear in our eyes because we stand the test of time

They poison us with lies, military state of mind
Well keep fighting till we die because they can't take us alive
Montreal to worldwide it's time to rise
We will survive, Victory through Unity!

(UMR! UMR! UMR!)

[Verse 2]
I light a candle for Freddy Villanueva and DJ Just In Time
Victims of the system, their murders were never justified
Stop in the name of the law, they say we must comply
But cops sending kids to the morgue, it's time to take a side
We headed on a path of wickedness, lost in this wilderness
If you aint got the stomach for this here then you aint built for this
We fighting for our freedom my people ready to kill for this
Revolution's now televised, so you can't filter this
Cause what you read and see on CNN and BBC
Is controlling your brain with subliminal bigotry
Leading people to believe that were nothing but thugs and terrorists
Fanatic fundamentalists, I've had it time to settle this
I'm blowing the whistle on officials, judges and presidents
Punk police, MP's and white supremacists
Next time you hit the streets, just remember we never weaponless
Marshall Law, door to door war, witness the genesis.

[Chorus:]
United we stand, divided we fall when we ride
It's the way that we living, the way that we feeling inside
You can try to take our lives but you can never take our pride
No fear in our eyes because we stand the test of time

They poison us with lies, military state of mind
Well keep fighting till we die because they can't take us alive
Montreal to worldwide it's time to rise
We will survive, Victory through Unity!

[Outro:]
United Minorities, from Montreal all over the world
My third world people
It's time to stand up, fight for what we believe in
It's time to ask yourself:
What is it you really believe in?
Cause we can't this lying down no more...
Yeah!</pre>
