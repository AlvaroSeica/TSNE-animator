[Chorus: Q]
It's 3 in the mornin, homie I ain't done
Yeah I'm ridin in my Jag and I'm headin to the sunset
I'm gone and I'm gone and I'm gone and I'm gone
I'm gone and I'm gone and I'm gone and I'm gone
I'm gone off Patrón, I'm gone off the Henny
I'm gone off the Goose and I'm gone off the Remy, hey
And I'm gone and I'm gone and I'm gone and I'm gone
I'm gone and I'm gone and I'm gone and I'm gone

[Shella]
I ain't the first of the Double R
But I'm the princess of the game, ain't no five stars
I'm a galaxy - and can't none of these scallywags battle me
I'm a franchise, uh, Macy's
Call me the Blasian, first name Shella uh
Came to the club, better bring a umbrella uh
Cause I make it rain uh, shit I do my thang uh
Haters over there, see I'm blowin my flame
Ice on my chest uh, heels on my feet uh
Flyer than a Learjet; yours ain't take off yet
Yeah I'm puttin on, yellow-bone tone
I'm the type of chick that every man want on they arm

[Chorus]

[Shella]
I got my Aviators on uh, shoes from Milan uh
Sippin champagne, 12 bottles of Patrón uh
I don't need a nigga for nothin
I got my own money, me and my girls stuntin uh
Cash and my purse cost more than four grand uh
Bitch I'm from Hawaii, you can tell by the tan uh
Under Tokyo lights anytime I'm in Japan uh
{?} - can you understand?
Cup full of Red Bull, cranberry Rémy uh
I am the brand uh, Gucci Louis Fendi uh
Goose with the pineapple, Sprite with the Henny uh
Got me so gone uh, uh, and I'm on, I'm on

[Chorus]

[Shella]
They say I'm easy on the eye, and I don't even try
These chickens like some penguins, tryin to be fly
Said, you could flap your wings but you'll never see the sky
And, I'm so gone I forgot to tell 'em bye uh
Some call me Shells uh, no not your Adidas
I'm somethin like {?} comin through your speakers
Not talkin 'bout the shells that, come out the Baretta
The best to ever do it so nobody do it better
Said my team took a break uh, cause they needed time out
Heavy in the game uh, and they never bow out
No one ahead of me, I guess I'm on track
Told 'em pass the baton and I never gave it back
I'm gone

[Chorus]

[Q] Yeah!
[S] It's the Blasian</pre>
