[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
The key to everything, everybody here in America
Is the money
Some say that it's the root of all evil
Brings wars and other cells of upheaval
Leaves family in the streets with nothing to eat
Little baby boys and girls
No shoes on their feet
All the men who leave home dying in the war zones
And the women do it all they own
It reminds me of the ghettos right here
And the hoods that I see,
Everywhere that I've been in the is country
Stop bailing out the banks and give the Franklins to me
I guess my piece of the pie ain't free, can you free

Ooooh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
He don't care and she don't care
They both got brand new clothes to wear
And they ain't worry
Cause they don't know
What it's like to be left out in the snow

The dirt
The filth
The gutter
The grime
The pain
The strain
The hustle
The climb
The struggle to fight
The conflict
The crime
I don't bye that line that it's nature's design
You different,
You ugly,
You evil
You wrong
You stupid
You dumb
Your mind ain't too strong
Your daddy ain't from here
So you don't belong
And the list goes on and on and on and on..

[Chorus]</pre>
