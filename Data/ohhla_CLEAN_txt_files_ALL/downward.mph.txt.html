And you say Melbourne city {*X2*}

[Verse 1]
It's not pain, it's not the loss and it's not the gain
It's not that I don't give a toss and it's not that I'm too game
It's definitely not simple and plain
It's what's called drains, can't exactly explain
Can't work out from where it came
Can't point the finger and blame but all the same
I've played the part, hid behind the scarf
Strayed from the path, the mask was worn
Heart was torn, since I was born
I've strayed from the norm and their uniform lies
Visualise me with the key to survive and economise
Perform live, strive and accomplish
Whilst always remaining honest, the pompous got honours
The mind was with the scene
Used to feel like a decent human being
But lately the things that I've seen
The thoughts that I've thought, the way that I've been
Doesn't really seem like I'm swimming in the stream
Directed at my dreams
Mister Sheen, I'm really quite keen
Can't you clean up my act so I can see the tracks?
And get back to where I was headed
I've done many a thing that I've regretted
But the best thing to do is just forget it
I'm sorry body if I left you neglected

[Chorus] {X2}
The downward spiral, round and round like a vinyl
Twisting, turning, aching
Hurting flames, pain and burning
The downward spiral, the downward spiral

[Verse 2]
No sleep, very little to eat
I concentrate ever so deep, rap to a beat
Sink some piss and then I put up my feet
No time for grief, I'm tired of the speech
The leech sucks at my energy
I'm always tired both physically and mentally
They say eventually that things will fall
right into place but I still stand and stare at space
Are you prepared to take faith with a firm grasp?
Been a while since I sincerely laughed till my gut ached
Harsh remarks spread sparse, I'm lurking in the dark
Searching for my prey just like a shark
My heart seems to be losing its feel
Like that perfect girl is now losing her appeal
Similar to the youth but still you lose your conscious
At the same time I lost a little confidence
Nonsense filled my brain and became an idiosyncrasy
Part of my character, I guess now the cold chills have gotten into me
Similarly I've seen people take the opposite turn
I earned a little holiday from being a kind citizen
I leap into the downward spiral

[Chorus] {X2}

[Verse 3]
She lost that spark, so did I
Still question why, try to defy the odds
Got along without a steady job
Robbed of usual passion
Often imagine how dope I would make it
Previously I stated that my life was sacred
and I can't waste it, damn I can't
Shan't and won't, don't let me give up
Nup, you must leave those depressive ideas crushed
You must trust self, starting to feel the urge to surge
Splurge and search
Solomon's track "Love for Life" struck a nerve
I heard loud and clear
So now the downward spiral is out of here
It's out of here, it's out of here
Get the fuck out of here

Surprising, rising, hoping, floating
Coping, soaked in the richness of life
Surprising, rising, hoping, floating
Coping, soaked in the richness of life</pre>
