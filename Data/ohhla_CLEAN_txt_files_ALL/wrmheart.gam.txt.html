[Intro]
I do not talk, I AM JUST A RAPPER

[Childish Gambino]
Childish Gambino, yeah, I got that swagger
Yeah a hater mad but it just don't matter
These girls all know that I got that cheddar
Put it on a sandwich and eat it off a platter
My mouth vacationin, chillin on her lawn
It's amazing how I'm off but I'm on
Lame niggaz try to make a move like pawn
I'm the one and only Bambi, no fawn
Give me that track man, leave it to professionals
I am just a rappe, man, talk like a vegetable
Don't be surprised, my face don't change
A nigga make waves like a baseball game
I'ma do me so hard I'll get pregnant
Will I have another me? Nigga trick question
There's only one of me like the G in this sentence
G for Gambino, wear a crown like dentures
Thanks to the fans, love you like family
No I don't remember when my mouth lost its sanity
Nerdy girls hipster, Frye boots hoodie
make me wanna fuck the whole word in a good way
And if I can't say, he is so handsome
"Get Like Me," that's the +Sick Boi+ anthem
I AM JUST A RAPPER, so I'm not speaking
And I won't stop like a vampire's weekend
Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick...

["Warm Heart of Africa" by The Very Best]
Is hip-hop hereditary? I don't know
Oh, the boys move fast, you should take it slow
Well, we all need someone to tell us when to go
A beat-box imaginary in the show
All your shell-toes lined up in a row
All your favorite breaks, your favorite ELO... </pre>
