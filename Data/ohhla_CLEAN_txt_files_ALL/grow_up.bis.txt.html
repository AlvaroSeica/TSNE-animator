[Bishop Lamont]
(Verse 1)
I used to think fuckin' up was cool
Loved ditchin' class til I didn't pass high school
My dad always said, "It's easier to keep up
Than it is to catch up," but all I did was mess up
Roll around the streets, get drunk and shoplift
Freestyle, meanwhile, continue to bullshit
A teenage life, when you think you know everything
About everything and don't know a damn thing
Hit the 'shaw, liquor, bank, then the gas station
Get to duckin' when they buck in gang altercation
We scatter, then come right back
Shit, riskin' our lives, but never saw it like that
A few blocks down the street, couple fools get capped
Nigga, bullets ain't picky, it could've been a wrap
It never hits home until your homie get clapped
You at the funeral with tears, saying to yourself
"You gotta grow up"

Chorus: Bishop Lamont
Way up (Up, up, up, up)
Way up (Up, up, up, up)
Way up (Up, up, up, up)
Way up (Up, up, up, up)
You not a kid no more (Nah)
I think it's time to grow (Yeah)
Homie, you better know (Tell 'em)
You know it's time to grow
Way up (Up, up, up, up)
Way up (Up, up, up, up)
Way up (Up, up, up, up)
Way up (Up, up, up, up)
Cause nigga, you too grown (Right)
Get out and get your own (Right)
Your childish ways are gone (Tell 'em)
I think you better grow up

(Verse 2)
You got a Bentley, but can't keep gas in it
A Gucci wallet
But ain't got cash in it
Go out to eat, it's your treat, then at the last minute
Say you forgot it, never had it, want them to spend it
Now that's an interestin' thang
Cause in your video, you havin' so much blang
A few days ago, I heard you pawned that chain
Instead of coppin' that, you should have copped the food chain
V-necks, mohawks, just ain't me
Shit, it barely looked right on Mr. T
Your biker chains, designer shades, just ain't right
Especially when you can't breathe cause your pants's too tight
Wack beats, catchy hooks, and little ass kids
Add a dance to it and it's gon' be big
It's our fault everything done flip-flopped
You wanna save hip hop, rappers, then
You gotta grow up

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Nigga still cruisin' Crewshaw at thirty-six
Your wife at home, you wastin' gas, tryin' to bust a bitch
At the club, actin' young, wearin' the wrong shit
Think you're Chris Brown, but you look like Keith Sweat, bitch
Ain't you got kids to raise?
Instead of actin' like them, nigga, act your age
Why you wear a wave cap, but ain't got waves
Wear that shit out in public and on church days
And God damn, niggas, pull up your pants
Got your drawers all out, what, you wanna strip dance?
And homeboy, what you doin' in a 5X?
You ain't that big, shit's lookin' like a dress
You bought an iPhone but live in your momma home
Gotta wait til she's asleep before you can bone
You grown, you know you wrong
But either way, someday, homeboy
You know you gotta grow up

Repeat Chorus</pre>
