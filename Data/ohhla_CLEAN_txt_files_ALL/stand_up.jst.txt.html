[Intro: Scarface sample w/ King Just ad-libs]
"Let's get this straight now
I never fucked anybody over in my life
Didn't have it coming to them, you got that?
All I have in this world is my balls and my word
And I don't break them for no one, do you understand?
That piece of shit up there, I never liked him, I never trusted him
Do you wanna go on with me, you say it
You don't, then you make a move"

[King Just]
Hey Mr. Big Mouth, you wanna get tooken out?
You about to dig yourself a hole you can't get out
What you all about, you shout, cuz you wheeled and hurt
I drink Hennessey with dimes, you drink Betty with birds
What's the word? And you? I ain't never heard
I been holding down my curb, cuz ya'll niggas is nerds
You get splurged like you ain't follow the woods of the king
Every song that I sing is every soon that you sing
With supreme bling, damn that nigga doing his thing
Fasting, flash culture, murder, this murderous sling ring
Mobbed it, when I bomb shit, funkier than armpits
Bring it back to '86, run ya garments
Big contract like Garnett, and I ain't even on yet
But King Just, you on that, blow that
You ain't never give a slack, when they never gave back
Call me wack, I love that, see me at the platinum party
Where dude with the gun and the guard, by the door, by me
Try me, U.S.S.R. Commy, sand keeps the beef
Concrete the streets, the bullet in the heat if I don't eat
We gon' meet on the twelve o'clock news with no rules
Put my ass in your face like the Da Vinci mood
Fuck Stella and her groove in my interlude
Cuz she drink mad booze, and fuck mad dudes
My crew out the zoo, like when animals attack
A whole bunch of Who Yous from the front to the back
You hear that? When dudes used to be like, yo chill, I do your free track
Believe that, everything I say is real
Put your flame piece to blame, your oatmeal be scummed in, for real
For real, for real, for real, for real, for real</pre>
