[Tripp Locc] 
Wayniac (What's up?), I think we oughta check it 
for a second straight record for them fools disrespectin 
(Disrespect what?) the flow. 
And being the Tripp Locc, I just can't take it no more 
(so?), let me televise my shit the underground 
MTV, the Box, BET it's still hits 
24-7 eastsidein' it, G ridin 
we slidin, bomb to the fullest, fuck hidin' it. 
You know what's up wit' me the dollar bill and my steal, 
I play for keeps, that's on the real 

[Wayniac] 
Now get the glass and the yak and take a step back 
and try to figure out this nigga Wayniac, the maniac 
when it comes to a track 
it's like this, or should I say it's like that (like that) 
I got that knack to make the beats smack 
from my nine-millimeter microphone Mack 
10-9-8-wait-B-e-a-c-h, city is the place to be 
with my brother Tripp Locc and the G funk family. 

Chorus 

[Tripp Locc] 
We just doin' our thang, straight up, it's fixin' to hit the fan 
serious like that cuz some ain't goin understand 
Anticipation got'em all on the sack 
all my time that I gotta spin up that track 
Money got me motivated, word up to my moms 
nine-four set it up so now it's time for the bomb 
to get dropped, non-stop on my way to the T-O-P 
servin' conversation, as if it were some cavi 

[Wayniac] 
You could tell I was a hustla from the start 
which meant the Locc and me could never ever see a mark 
cuz sippin-ass niggas wear them pumps to get fed 
bitches steady gankin' while they puffin' up your head 
Since I'm the Loc they come and show we just chillin 
peepin out my whole click I'm wit make a killin 
you know me I'm the one that will always make'em pay 
but for now I'ma slide and listen to the women as they say 

Chorus 

[Tripp Locc] 
Catch a grip young Tripp, that's what they told me 
I gotta thank god for all my true homies 
you molded me, into a true G 
that's how I put it down (That's right) with Tripnology 
and dissocology from G to G 
helps a nigga like me see clearly 
I'm tellin' you the truth with proof 
it's like a pimp tryin to pimp some hoes with no coupe 
(you know how that go) Stoop down (Down) 
and listen to the look alike, dynamite, trump tight twins 
from the P-A-C, 
Poly Apartments for them niggas that ain't from the LBC.
