Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Blown Awayyy, Blown Awayyy
So Blown Awayyy, Blown Awayyy

Uh, Raps I buss em
Problems with my life don't discuss em
Coups and leer jets I lust them
Can't hear them haters talk
I'm above them
But they push me to do it
That's why I love them
Fittin snub in the Chevy seat
Niggas see the future
That's ahead of me
And wish that it was cease to be
Buzz increase until it became a bang
Jet planes in the building
Bitch we do our thang
Who the main manuveur
The coup in vancouver
Canadian ladies is speakin
The fly language
I'm partially famous
Popularity gaining
They wondering when I blow
Am I gunna lose my underground soul
The answer is hell no
I'm definatley maintaining
I'm way to G
Them other niggas do their thang
But them niggas ain't me
Wear what you can't buy
Slidin where you can't be

Blown Awayyy, Blown Awayyy
So Blown Awayyy, Blown Awayyy
(Hehehe) Just Blown Awayyy

Roll somethin up
Mama what's the smoke in here
Sneak in here and wing tips
I never bought a pair
Out of dress code
Still getting in there
Girlfriend now rolling like a wheelchair
MDA and THC combining
She high climbing into the truck
We ridin, jack move fool
Ain't no denying the cool
The mirror image ain't quick enough
To mimic my move
You niggas thoughts about as shallow
As a kiddie pool
Can't articulate themselves
In their interviews
Rappers on a respirators
Breathing through a tube
Revivin with the live shit
We make it good as new
Tired of hand jobs
Shit, my nigga me too
Bad bitches want the real
Baby girl I feel you
Only thing I can do
Is move pen or pencil
Write and smoke my life away
As I continue...

Blown Awayyy, Blown Awayyy
So Blown Awayyy, Blown Awayyy
Just Blown Awayyy

Try to act like you
Ain't know the planes got it
I'm in Chi-town smoking
Like a train charlotte
Never match
They say I dress train spotta
I just stay up collecting sky mileage
I'm a high pilot
You must acknowledge
The fact that I'm not a novice
Professional driver on a closed circuit
Monster beats got Nascar spitta
On them tracks perfect
Grind outta my mind
Because it's so worth it
Enable spitta to make a big purchase
3 story crib, driveway half-circle
Dodge Barracuda nigga
Concrete surfer
Engine growling like a rottweiler
Trynna hurt ya
Bags of purple strong enough
To Stephan Urquille outta Urkel
Spitta hand deliver fly verses
Three accidents on purpose, yeah...</pre>
