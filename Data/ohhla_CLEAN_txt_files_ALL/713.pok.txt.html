[Chorus - 2x]
This for paper profit, you know they can't stop it
On the 3rd Coast, you know we mix it then chop it
Houston style, you know that's how the South does it
7-1-3, and the public they love it

[Lil' Keke]
It ain't chips and cheddar, I ain't really trying to hear it
I'm all about my cash, get my money period
The bottom, where the top is out of reach
Gotta get it how I live, cause my family gotta eat
When I'm digging down low, trying to push that snow
Turning corners hitting cuts, jamming chopped and slow
So I'm constantly trying to get it, with the hustle I got
Every thug every gangsta, doing it block for block
For them G's on the yard, doing it day for day
I got blood in my eye, to the Lord I pray
It's a sinful year, but I'm staying right here
I'm bout to shift down in fourth, and try to change my gear
This the 3rd Coast, we love our music slowed up
With styrofoam cups, that's iced and po'd up
Lil' Ke and Big Poke, puffing on big smoke
S.U.C. nigga, and the click is kin folk

[Chorus - 2x]

[Big Pokey]
When you see us hit the do', you know that it's going down
Respect the code, S.U.C. up hoes on the ground
These bitches can move around, cause a nigga don't need
No bitches slowing me down, when I'm moving full speed
Keep these bitches on they knees, and these niggaz in they place
Steel trigger on the waist, and it's 7-1-3
Money come fast it go, you gotta mash
Get your cash, we got that cocaine eleven a key
In the booth I got propane, y'all ain't ready for me
I'm fin's to show these rookies some'ing, they ain't ready to see
Think this R-A-P game, is bout bitches and fun
I'm in the dope house right now, with mic's speakers and guns
Trying to turn crumbs to tons, I'll take it in ones
This good game, you could take it and shake it but when I come
Low to the ground, move it like a fire lever
Hit the hoe like a diesel, turn into a hot stepper

[Chorus - 2x]

[Mussilini]
G'eah bobbing my head, leaning flipping the loot
I just hopped in the red, bout to smoke on the truth
Uh paper profit, that's all I know
New voice and do-do, that's all I blow
Stat sheet off the chain, our record's phenomenal
From the deck to the trunk, back up in your abdominal
The abominable, slow men run up in your do' men
Quick to leave your chest open, and cum up in your hoe men
I'm coasting the seven seas, c.d.'s and felonies
O.G.s be telling me, trying to guard the hell in me
But Lord I feel this currency, feeling it nicely
Shit all my life, it's been Green's and Isley
Reverted and mobbing constantly, honestly
Off rap I'm retiring, this a 3rd Coast be here for real it's our time
My city be the city, that stay jumping
All times for that paper, bitch

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
