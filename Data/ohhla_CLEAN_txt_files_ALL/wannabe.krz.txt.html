Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm very truthful when I'm bussin'
Get my plane across a minimal cussin'
(You know the deal)
I've been like a wild boy
But I'm really a choir boy
Most niggas wanna tell you when they bluffin'
(Then they keep it real)
No more mister nice guy, doubt I
Ever be the same if you shout my
Way I don't speak in vain
I'm Christian but keep a thing
And Christopher's page shifts about dry
Homie toughie toughie you niggas been since I had to huffy
Never bluffin', a good boy, mommy and daddy loved me
A few scufflin', scuffed knees, left pulleys up above me
Ice puffy, they only livin' cause they be lucky
But my bigger brother tell me take another ass whoopin' and see
By the rock 'em sock 'em roll bottle he believe that the owner is me
He showed me the one hitter quitter
They picked up the nigga in the middle
Open up a can and they deliver
What you want me to be?

(Could I)
Could I don't bring out the things you need
You can't see when I smile
Could I take me to a place, I'll stay a while
But you want merely just wild out on you
Only seem to have now don't you?
Only to be a
Could I forge a name and forget who I am?
You'd be a wannabe

Hardcore!
It come from the good rappin' of the hood and you're gettin'
Far more!
Never been a good but a nigga would if you wanna
Start war!
I got some killers on the payroll
I keep them at bay cause I'm an angel let me explain
I make my music to travel
What I saved up is you can't help you out
Think I can do better nigga then help me out
My wits is what make me my hits but I'll never be sailin' out
K.I.L.L. beat to the R without spillin' it out
I'm out doin' what I do even if it only get heard by a few
Where the hell are you? Move can I catch now never got the clue
Stickin' two of my flocks on two doin' with the sue
See I can't kill them on every verse so I just hurt them
That's why I riddly speak of myself in third person
Kali baby carry my weight, make no mistake you're late
I'm the protégé of the great Aaron D. Yates [Tech N9ne]
You know it's beats and bars so it can beat the peoples' cars
I'm freakin' if they see surprise
What you want me to be?

Could I don't bring out the things you need
You can't see when I smile
Could I take me to a place, I'll stay a while
But you want merely just wild out on you
Only see me climb out don't you?
Only to be a
Could I forge a name and forget who I am?
You'd be a wannabe

Listen! Been killin' 'em since '99 right
Can't see me in the daytime with a flashlight
People think I'm the reaper lessons striken from fear
Kali knocks them off their feet, Twiztid you take it from here

Don't think I'm bullshittin'
Everybody wanna get up on my skin with a groove rhythm
Gotta find another way to get the angle right
But change a rap and I'm lose in 'em
Though money be the same thing
Gain and again to maintain fame
Rather be different to make a name with a lame
But all I wanna do is take it away
Hate when I say that you
Stuck in the game with a
Bunch of shameless of
Worms are the name listen
Grades for blades gonna come save them baines for us
All because you wanted to push me now I'm dangerous
Hang with a strange gang and bangs with a gangbangin'
And saints with the brains makin' me do but to the brain nature
I hope you understand and I tried to be a peaceful man
But all they wanted from me is a crazy, I don't understand

And I'm all little bit strange, a little bit smart
Always come hard when I speak from the heart
Always hard felt with the birds of the kid
Cause I spit it with a passion, they call it sick
And when they call me sick do I need a medicine
To keep me on track and away from the edge
'cause if I lose control I'm goin' in a killer patch
And I won't stop killin' 'til everybody is dead
I'm insane
I'm talkin' to my brain but it does not reciprocate
There's only one concern with fame
I wanna kill them all away
Everyone that stands in my way
They want to bring the night upon me and let it consume the day
And I forget
I should grow weak instead of stay strong
Because their love is unconditional even though that I'm gone
At least they tell me that I'm wrong when I know I'm probably right
That's why I'm walkin' with the dead and I don't sleep a wink at night

Could I don't bring out the things you need
You can't see when I smile
Could I take me to a place, I'll stay a while
But you want merely just wild out on you
Only see me climb out, don't you?
Only to be a
Could I forge a name and forget who I am?
You'd be a wannabe</pre>
