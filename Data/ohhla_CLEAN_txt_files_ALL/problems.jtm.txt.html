Let it go
Let it go
If the ho wanna ho nigga let it go(4x)

[JT Money Talkin]
That's what im talkin bout
Niggaz need to let it go, ya know
Hearin all these stories about, niggaz goin to jail
Diein bout these muthafuckin ho's, you know what im talkin about

[Chorus]
Ho problems aint no problems
Dont hate the game cuz that aint gone solve em
Nigga you need to let that muthafucka go
Just like you got it you can find another ho

[JT Money]
See ho's come a dime a dozen
What you is nigga hard up but lovin
Pushin and shovin abouts a woman
Who givin up the ass
Homeboy ya buggin
I told you bout trustin them stankin ass H-O's
You gotta learn to work them bitches for the PESO's
Stop trippin bout that pussy cuz it AINT YOUR's
Y'all niggaz need to learn how the game go
It's a trip and I will tell yo' ass no more
Young nigga put shit past no ho
For you cry like a sucka go solo
Cuz them bitches damn sure call the Po-Po's
In any case bro

[Chrous]
Ho Problems aint no problems
Dont hate the game cuz that aint gone solve em
Nigga'z fall in love but they just dont know
When you gonna learn to let a ho be a ho(my nigga) (x2)

[JT Money}
It's another one of them ho things
Niggaz be a addicted like cocaine
Straight up and down naw that aint the way to go man
Quit trippin bout them grabbin ass gold diggers
Naw real niggaz fall jus cuz you a ho nigga
Spend a lotsa loots jus so you can knock the boots
Of a  slimy ass scandolous prostatute
Nigga you betta try to fade dat bitch
Cuz me and the boys straight slayed that bitch(mmmhmm)
And I aint liein neither
Trippin bout them ho's betta leave that shit to beaver
Cuz a nigga run through yo shit
Fuckin all these ho's and dont give a fuck who yo' bitch
Cuz shit get bad for your health
And if you got ho problems betta keep em to yourself
Probably alotta other niggaz that'll hit her
But you just a weak nigga that fell in love with em

[Chrous]
Ho Problems aint no problems
Dont hate the game cuz that aint gone solve em
Nigga'z fall in love but they just dont know
When you gonna learn to let a ho be a ho(my nigga) (x2)

[JT Money]
What if your girl let another nigga hit it
Would you accept it our would you cry like a bitch
You'd probably try to kill her then kill yourself
Sayin she wasnt real but you wasnt real yourself
Cuz you knew she was a ho when you met her
But the pussy so good you just wanted it forever
And it hurt you to know another nigga got it
But tell me dogg what could you do to stop it
NOTHIN!

[Chrous]
Ho Problems aint no problems
Dont hate the game cuz that aint gone solve em
Nigga'z fall in love but they just dont know
When you gonna learn to let a ho be a ho(my nigga) (x2)

[JT Money Talkin]

But im in it to put it down for dat real you know
Let you niggaz knowa bout these ho's

[Chrous]
Ho Problems aint no problems
Dont hate the game cuz that aint gone solve em
