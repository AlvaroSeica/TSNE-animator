[Lil' Dap]
So much anger, built inside
I'm a legend of my time, 95 is mines
and this punk-style niggas thinkin' that they are fly
Talk about the ghetto life but they don't know the hard times
I'm eatin curried chicken and rice and these hoes look nice
Smoking lala with my nigga 'till the day turns night
Watchin fiends hustle for schemes to fuck up their dreams
We watch their back it's cool, you never know who's a fool
Real niggas know the rule I pack a tool for these fools
Hop, skip, ya lose in this inner city blues
Check it out where my niggas at?
Where my niggas at? Where my niggas at? ...

[Nutcracker]
Hey yo nigga I flip, and drugs I shift
I shoot a nigga in his face 'fore I shoot the gift, check it
Swing the mic livin trife do what you like
I hit your moms in the head with a metal pipe
Walk through the valley of death with no fear
and huntin suckas like a runaway deer
So step off son you just can't get none
No matter how strong they come they get DONE
I grab my gun in the presence of danger
I'm real frustrated with so much anger
Express myself, violently that's how I think
So stand back, I'm hittin harder than a fuckin tank
I just clock my G's and keep steppin
I'm gettin respect of for the damage I be wreckin
The Nutcracker and I have no pity
That's how it is for the kids in the inner city

[Lil' Dap]
Lyric disolve from your dome will get done before I break your brain
Ain't nothin' to insane got them open like cocaine
Check it out party people as I speak with the lisp
People said we couldn't do it 'cause they can't feel it
Yo, the Group Home represent the low budget environment
Word is born shit is on now let's all sing along
Check it out for my nigga that are R-I-P
Pourin beer on the street, think about your deceased
Nothing can be better but the shit goes on
But that's life ah, in the inner city

[Nutcracker]
I make you wanna jump, psych, I kill a fuckin mike
I write the hype dope lyrics that you like
I stay low key to myself and keep steppin
You wanna fight while I'm reachin for my murder weapon
A young nigga, I'm only 18
When my peoples had beef, I was always on the scene
I'm the Nutcracker and I do what I like
That's how we live in this inner city life

Now now now let's get this straight
I am the star of this act
Don't nothin scar a nigga daddy, sheeit
Niggas ain't scared of nothin
Except not being able to get some pussy</pre>
