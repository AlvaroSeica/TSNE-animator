[Sean Price] + (Starang Wondah)
Yeah (my man Sean P)
Yo yo yo yo, yo, yo yo
(Y'all niggaz don't know what y'all unleashed right now)
P! (Know what I'm sayin?) Yo, listen
Motherfuck you and whatever you stand for
Shoot the club up, leave blood on the dancefloor
Motherfuck you and whatever you stand for
Motherfuck... motherfuck...

Listen, motherfuck you and whatever you stand for
Shoot the club up, leave blood on the dancefloor
Niggaz can't board, the game is fucked up
That ain't true Ruck, that's just your dumb luck
Stupid-ass niggaz, Ruger black niggaz
Roll the kush, light it up, two and pass niggaz
You still ass nigga, shoot the fair one
The constitution say I got right to bare guns
(So) I walk around town with the pound strapped down
Back a nigga down, slap him with a round
Niggaz claimin they king 'til I cap 'em in they crown
They'll be the court jester, we laughin at your clowns
Yeah, laugh now cry later
You kiss my ass goodbye but I'm back - hi haters!

[Starang Wondah]
It's like I told y'all niggaz
