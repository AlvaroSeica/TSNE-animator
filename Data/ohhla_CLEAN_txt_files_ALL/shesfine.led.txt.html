Missy be the shiggidy, bomb diggidy
I can take yo man shawty, that's fo'shiggidy
Fo'shiggidy, I make a lot of miggidy
Money ain't a thiggidy, I make these hoes sick of me
I'm makin history like Khaled make a movie
It's yours truly, I'm stingy with the booty
Spend the lucci, on the bags and the shoes

I love the groupie, who wanna do me
He gotta have the ching-a-ling to taste the oochi
Oochie Wally baby, you got a Marley baby?
Go and get me baby, fuckin with this hottie baby

Dem gotta spend the ching-a-ling on me, eh eh eh
Dem gotta spend the ching-a-ling on me, wooo!

[Busta Rhymes]
I dont care if you a nun - KNOCK ON WOOD!
I'm a muh'fuckin freak and yo' ass look good 
And I'll give it to you good until the day we through
Heard you a freak? Yeah me too!
And I'll monkeyfuckya in a way you never heard-a
Choke you with my tongue while I peal your La Pearla
My little momma open and there ain't no denyin
Shawty gobblin up my meat even when a nigga drivin
You got enough to eat? Well here's a sip of Aquafina 
Mouth so pretty wit'cha lips like Angelina
I aint never seen a chick look like such a winner 
Shawty got a mix look like she got a little foreign in her
How she give it to me when she had to - do it, do it
She was makin funny noises like - oohee, ooheee
Had me lookin at her funny and I knew I wasn't buggin 
Shawty made the kinda sounds like I was dickin down a Russian

[Chorus]
