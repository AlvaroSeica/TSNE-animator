Drop it..
{*scratched: "the hard rhymer" - Chuck D*}
Word.. word..
T-t-t-tiggidy-tell 'em what to do money
{*scratched: "tellin you to hear it" - Chuck D*}
True.. true..
Yeah..

[Tony D]
No holdin back, when it's time to attack
Like Saddam Hussein - you're wack and insane (word)
And I'ma crack your brain like an egg-ah
and make ya beg, for mercy
Cause this is raw as raw gets
Take off the jeans and put on the sweats
and get loose, this ain't a gimmick or a trick
Step in my path and I'ma break that stick
with the quickness - cause Tony don't play that
Get the fuck out my face or I'ma spray that mug
and you'll say why'd I bug
As you tried to sweep the dirt, under the rug
But ask the question, why is he buggin, why is he trippin?
But little did he know that that was poison he was sippin
And you can drink it dowwwwn
then (what?) You won't be around
So long live the posse the one and only
Who's the phony?  That other Tony
You can't stab me I got eyes in my back..
.. cause Tony don't play that

[Chorus]
{*scratches*} Tony don't play that
{*scratches*} Tony don't play that
{*scratches*} Tony don't play that
{*scratches*} ..

[Tony D]
Tony don't play that, and here's a reason to play dis
It's (??) all the shit on your playlist
with all this tooth fairy, twinkletoes, Peter Pan rap
It sounds good to hear somebody snap..
.. once in a while, y'knowhatI'msayin? I mean flip it up switch it up
Or if not - you might as well give it up
But don't be an indian giver
And try to relive the past cause all you had
was a sliver of a piece of cake, you couldn't even partake
Sittin there sayin to yourself you can make
a comeback, but you was never in the front
In my estimations you was never in the hunt
You wasn't in the thick of it, you couldn't stick with it
so quit it (I quit!) Done did it
from the jump start, I kept tellin you you was wack (word)
And Tony don't play that

[Chorus]

Tony ain't..
{*scratched: "nothing to play with"*}

[Tony D]
My name ain't Paco and I ain't eatin no taco
So don't come up to me talkin, "Alright Rocko"
Cause damn - I said I know who I am
So you don't have to remind me everytime you shake my hand
Point blank, understand, don't you think I noticed?
There's a mirror in my room, that would clearly show this
I have 20/20 vision and my vision's never blurry
Don't worry - what are you in a hurry?
Or waitin for a call from Fiji
My name ain't Luigi, I'm not at your car with a squeegee
Or all at your feet with a cup talkin WHATTUP
or beggin - like some young punk
Cause I'm definitely in this, and very very generous
But on the other hand YOU, you're penniless
Pity this?  Hell no, I get rid of this
And take it to your mom and she said, "Look what you did to this!"
What did I do to him; you oughta be glad I took him home
He can't even walk, because I broke nearly every bone
But besides the point, be thankful that he's back..
.. cause Tony don't play that

[Chorus]

[Tony D]
Tony don't play that, word
