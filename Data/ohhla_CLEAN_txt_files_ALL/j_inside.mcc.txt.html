Song:   Jelly Inside
Typed by: @_mcchris

People try to make me mad because they're (a-lose)
Stalk me nonstop they can't help that they're confused
So here's a song to listen to
If trolls control your daily mood
Don't give up (daily dick-tributions)
Software's all they can produce

Trolls on my wall and I really wonder why
They just jelly of my peanut butter rhymes
Cut of your crust if they try to bust wise
Stupider than Jupiter
Now you must die

No bad ass brand that's crackling oats
You need a better plan than attack the poet
You need a geek who attacks the mic
You need to speak up if you down with life

You need to see that I'm just a dude
I post too much but so do you
Jumping on my jams like a kangaroo
Put up your hands if I tell the truth

MC don't need it and he don't deserve
To be bullied by a world of wounded nerds
I know that you're mad, don't go berserk
I am the jam your jelly preserves

You're just jelly inside, I'm just loving life
My success took a long time not overnight
You talk trash that I jump with my motorbike
FUUCK YOUU!

Take a step back try being impartial
You're pissing on parades cause you're not the martial
Don't hate on the break that can't be broken
Why are we fighting when we should be toking

Why are you hating on your favorite things
No one likes the stink of the shit you sling
Spotlight's not right, if you don't own it
Like to interact, it's a crucial component

Of what I'm trying to do, be different and new
Talk to my fans like they're all in my crew
Share cause I care, won't keep it inside
You need to deal, or peal your ride

Believe you me I've seen harder days
[?] marmalade
Hate in your heart is the pitiful part
These digital criminals are traditional tarts

You're just jelly inside, I'm just loving life
My success took a long time not overnight
You talk trash that I jump with my motorbike
FUUCK YOUU!
