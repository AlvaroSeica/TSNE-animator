Song:   Just a Feelin'
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, I can feel it I can feel it
Use to be so close now I feel like we so distant
You're telling me its nothing so I'm hoping that I'm trippin
Hoping that I'm trippin
Cuz Its really just a feeling that you're seeing someone different
Girl you got me sippin Rosay bottles I been tippin back to back to back to back
Now I'm sittin here just wishin
Sittin thinkin reminiscing. Like you say that you been workin
Thought you said yall closed at ten but I cant really be certain
Cause this liquor got me dizzy if there someone girl that isn't
tell me, look me in my eyes, is he someone from the city
Do you love em do you like em have yall ever gotten busy
In my bed in OUR bed girl I know I'm moving quickly
But this feeling stickin with me got my skin feelin so itchy Baby
If you did this too me then we clipse
ain't talkin movies and no rappers I'm just saying what is this?
Can you explain?
Can you tell me where you been?
Girl I'm not gunna ask again Nahhh

Ah Was it worth it was it worth it?
I know I make mistakes I know I know I wasn't perfect
but tell me what I did that would make someone deserve this
Girl I said I'm sorry so lets not bring up the past
Snatch the mirror off the glass
When I told you you could go didn't think you'd be so fast
Vrrooom Gone like you racing got your heels all on the gas
look I need another shot I cant take it baby tell me
Lets just keep it real talk me how you really feel
If you're thinking that its over baby tell me I can take it
Wait I'm lyin so don't tell me that just tell me well be fine
If you cant don't say nothin girl just leave it in my mind
Cause the more I think about it don't know what Id do without it
Girl its really just a feeling really just a feeling
part of me is hoping other half is been concealing so this ain't really my style
but I need to hear you need me girl
the way you hesitating girl got me feeling like a G

Its Really just a feelin.. So I'm hopin that I'm tripin..</pre>
