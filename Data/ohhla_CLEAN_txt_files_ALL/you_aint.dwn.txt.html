[Fingazz]
You ain't gettin' nothin'
No, you ain't gettin' nothin'

Chorus:
[Fingazz] I got a ice chain, with my name on it
[Down]    What you want, girl, you ain't gettin' nothin'
[Fingazz] I got a big truck, with a sub in it
[Down]    I keep it G, girl, you ain't gettin' nothin'
[Fingazz] Got a phat crib with the pool in the back
[Down]    And it's all mine, girl, you ain't gettin' nothin'
[Fingazz] See me in the money, drop money by the sack
[Down]    I got it like that, yeah, I got it like that

[Verse 1: Down]
You got your mind on my money, and my money on your mind
But listen, baby girl, don't waste your time
Everything I got paid for, all mine
I know you like that
But here's the bottom line
I'm a G
And I'm makin' money
I don't wear suits, I rock a white tee
Cadillac truck with TV's and 23"s
I'm a hustler, you can't hustle me
But I ain't mad at ya
You got potential
Your body's bangin', baby
Work on your mental
Can't lie, I like the way that you shaking it
You like dough and the way that I'm making it
I see you lookin' at my chain, fool of rabbit food
I'll let you wear it later on, when you're in the nude
Yeah, I'm kind of rude
And I ain't no symp
Matter of fact, some like a Mexican pimp

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
[Down]       Yeah, I'm feelin' good
             I been cashin' checks
             Too legit to quit
             I never pay for sex
             You should know me
             Call me Boss Hog
             She said she heard me on the radio with Snoop Dogg
[Snoop Dogg] What up, Down, Down
[Down]       Just tryin' to let this
             Little mama know how a G put it down
[Snoop Dogg] Fa shizzle, dizzle
[Down]       Got a foot in the juego
             Hundred dollar bills, stackin' up like Legos
             I only run with the best
             You're killin' all the rest, fat booty and breast
             I'm impressed
             Might take it to my nest
             But the bed do the test, but I still won't invest
             Yeah
             So girl, get your groove on
             I know your song's on, get your best thong on
             You're better off tryin' to have fun in the club
             Cause you know damn well you can't huss with a thug

Repeat Chorus

[Fingazz]
You ain't gettin', you ain't gettin'
You ain't gettin' nothin'

[Verse 3: Down]
She was from H-Town like the Rockets
She crossed over, put her hands in my pockets
I told her, "Stop it"
Just jock it
Maybe later on, I put your thang in your socket
Yeah, I got a lot of things that a girl like
But you got a lot of things that a boss like
I got a big stack, you got a big bag
Meet me out back, in the back of my Cadillac

Repeat Chorus

[Fingazz]
You ain't gettin' nothin'
No, you ain't gettin' nothin'
You ain't gettin' nothin'
No, you ain't gettin' nothin'</pre>
