Uh!
Let's go to the beach, each, let's go get a wave
They, say, what they gonna say
Have a drink, click, found the Bud Light
Bad bitches like me is hard to come by
The Patr√≥n, on, let's go get it on
The zone-one, yes I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'ma blow all my money and don't give two shits
Oh!
 
[Bridge]
I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more
'til I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor
like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
then here I am
 
[Chorus]
Starships, were meant flyyyy-y-y-y!
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop, 'cause we're so hiiii-i-i-igh
Let's do, this one more time
Starships, were meant flyyyy-y-y-y!
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do, this one last tiiii-i-ime!
Can't stop.. {We're higher than a MOTHER-...Go!}
 
[Nicki Minaj]
Jump in my hooptie-hooptie-hoop - I owwwwn that
And I ain't paying my rent this month - I owwwwe that
But fuck who you want and fuck who you like
That's our life, there's no end in sight
Twinkle twinkle little star...
Now everybody let me hear you say 'ray 'ray 'ray
Come spend all your money 'cause today payday
And if you a G, you a G G G
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki
 
[Bridge]
Get on the floor, floor
like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
then here I am
 
[Chorus]
 
{We're higher than a MOTHER-...Go!}
