The F word feels ugly in my mouth
Clumsy, huff and puff, but I guess I'm not tough enough
I'd have to say mainly it makes me feel strangely
And frankly I'm not that angry a person
So cursin' and swearin' ain't part of my presentation
Play me on the radio without a moment's hesitation
Don't ever worry about your little sister listenin'
I used to have this thing for model Helena Christensen
Which is completely irrelevant, blueberry elephant
Anyway I like to consider myself more eloquent
I got more potent potions in my syringe
And when I hear one of my old songs with the F word I cringe now
I'm not tryin' to make anyone feel lesser
It's just that it don't go with any of the clothes in my dresser
Some people think that it's the best word in the English language
But for some reason recently, it causes me anguish

Saying the F word takes too much effort
Except when I'm having sex, I say it next to never
Saying the F word takes too much effort
Except when I'm having sex, I say it next to never
Saying the F word takes too much effort
Except when I'm having sex, I say it next to never
Saying the F word takes too much effort
Except when I'm having sex, I say it next to never</pre>
