I'm a lot like my dad I would have to say
He's been wearin a beard ever since mom passed away
She woulda hated it
Inspiring he likes to go to church to hear the choir sing

Roses and Bluejays, winter comes, game over
He's in the driveway removin snow with a flame thrower
Drives a hard bargain, knows how to get the deals
Spring fever hits he needs a new set of wheels
Every year it never fails
Roaming around in his home town beachcombing
Roses and Bluejays
I'm a lot like my father
He knows he should go to work but sometimes
He doesn't bother
Reads books of every sort
And gets all the news he needs from the weather report
The door stays open a few days and closes
What's more important than blue jays and roses?
Son of a gun, the old man is something else
In addition to being a bullfighter and magician
He's a lazy river, slow moving train
Future hall of famer, playing through the pain
He's a grizzly bear
And do you know one time he even saw a UFO?
My dad's favorite things are roses and bluejays
I'd say we're the same in more than a few ways we're

Full of beans and big ideas
'Cause I can't sleep I'm not sure why he is
Wide awake and off to the races
Out of gas and lost in space so
Full of beans and big ideas
'Cause I can't sleep I'm not sure why he is
Wide awake
And off to the races
Out of gas and lost in space</pre>
