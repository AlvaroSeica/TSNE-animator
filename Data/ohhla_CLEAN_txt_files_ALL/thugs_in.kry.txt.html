[Intro: Kryme Life]
T.M.F., C.G.'s
Criminal Grind, Kryme Life
Stapleton, Staple City

[Kryme Life]
We in the club G'd up, never eat up, double shots of Henny
Hittin' me, I don't even drink like that
Kid, I'd rather lean back with a sack ok that haze-o
Two mean bitches that be rocking the rainbow
Rubbers in all colors, shorty letting her face glow
Pimp big, you know we keep them hoes on a payroll
Ya haters in the back, misbehaving off the yac'
I'm dipping back like the Raiders, keep the razors in my hat
Just in case a nigga wanna act tough
Put your insides on the floor like a cognac Dutch
It ain't a party if, we don't attend it, and nine times out of ten
Niggas exit wound, we making our entrance
Cowards know what it is, and my goons troop
We here to open it up, like a hatchback or moon roof
Stomp on your, turn my cheese Timbs to maroon boots
Get your balloon popped, as soon as the tune stop

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
We uptown and we at a party
We come to check something, ready to wreck something
We up in B.K., and we at a party
We come to check something, ready to wreck somethinig
We out in Q.U., when we at a party
We come to check something, ready to wreck something
Yo, we ain't here to disrespect nothing
But if a nigga start fronting, then the tech's dumping

[Kryme Life]
They wanna know how we do what we doing, keep them things shooting, bitches moving
Keeping it grooving, in the club boozing, buzz's canooing
Thugs pushing through in them Escalades, S500's on twenty trays
Came up, since my younger days, bankrolls is what I crave
Til I got it made, ripping center stage, shoving them clips in them K's
Renegade Reno range, chasing niggas through the hood
For that fucking change, don't make me buck your brain
My niggas puff and strain, pussy, tuck in your chain
Before you come in this thang, straight repping for fame
I'm hungry, two twelve, two eighteen, grungy
Broadstreet money, Stapleton, it must be
Thugs in the club, thugs in the club
Thugs in the club, thugs in the club
Where the hood at? Tell me, where the hood at?
Where it's good at, baby where it's good at ?

[Chorus]</pre>
