[Off Topic]
Sitting on the train
Aesop in my headphones
Solo
"I Just Don't Give A Fuck" is my ring tone
I never battle but they recognize my silhouette
And come against me
I offer autographs
Real cocky
Nine out of ten just wanna rhyme with me anyway
I got no enemies 'cause they all just assimilate
I can offer them a strength that they can't even contemplate
It's not a gang, it's not a cult
We're just the human race
No leader
We're independent-minded free speakers
Learn it well enough that we could all become teachers
And then we kill each other off like an endangered species
You reached the Code Poets, leave a message at the beep
I transitioned from a mere musician
To a style so fresh
You think I had three wishes
And you'll never see me waste a breath
On my mission
Til the day I face a conviction for my convictions

[Off Topic]
Walking down the street
Got Nas in my headphones
Solo
"Machine Gun Funk" is my ring tone
New Jersey, New York, Illadelph, East Coast
Off Topic, Phase Fate, Snake Money, no one else
Hip-hop Camelot
Knights of the turntable
Go shot-for-shot and show you who holds the mic cable
Billion-dollar satellites
Watching me now
Got letters from the White House
Calling me out
They wanna tell you I'm not real
Cover my mouth
But they don't know I've got connects on the Hill
Bugs in their couch
They need a beautiful mind to figure me out
I'm so ahead of their time
They think I just came out
I got untouchable rhymes
That cause the people to rise up
'Cause we ain't getting' played in our house
Their fucking time's up
This is the gateway drug to distribution
One small step for the evolution of music</pre>
