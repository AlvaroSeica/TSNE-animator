Come on cuz, we almost there
We almost there cuz
Goddamn, where the finish line?

Fuck this shit, I need some chees
And I need the cookie and the nestle
If I have to kill then God bless me
All these pussy motherfuckers, they shouldn't have test me
Left me looking like the villian , I was thinking of ending
Nobody knew what I was going through
All these motherfuckers saying what they gonna do
But then again all these motherfuckers ain't true
So who am I gonna trust, am I going on and bust
Myself nigga, damn this shit
Fuck riding round' nigga, fuck being rich
I can't take it, the shit to thick
And it ain't my fault
So I ought to give the motherfucker telling lies to me
Hey the say, what its gonna be, but empty pockets all I goddamn see
D-E-F, no ones left, then again, shit no ones right
I'm a kill my damn self the night
I get fear, it ain't my fault he couldn't fight
It ain't like, when I motherfucking die, this whole world gonna fall apart
But it's a race, and I got a bad heart  
Breath in the mouth, and I got a head start

I'm running for nothing, I'm running for nothing (x8)
So I'm gonna kill myself

A motherfucker tellin' me what he gonna do
When I knew the motherfucker wouldn't do shit
A nigga tease you, then a nigga leave you
Cause he heard that the shit done got thick, punk bitch
I'm still in the mood for cocaine
The only thing I see when a nigga look
Come and get the baking soda, then open up the powder
???????? if it really don't matter
What the fuck you been through
If a motherfucker see you doin' better, my nigga I'm here to tell ya'
Motherfuckers gonna hate you
Not a clue, If I really wanna new motherfucking 22. 
?? far away
I never would have had a chance and would have killed myself on yesterday

hook

This heaven, where the streets of gold, and why the hell is the a/c off
Where the fuck, all the loved ones that I lost
Fuck this shit, take me to the boss
Do you understand the cost, ever paid
In order for me to be here tonight
Nigga whats up, something ain't right
Tell the Lord to turn on the damn light
Feeling like an angel when I take flight
Shit, as I try I'm on the damn mic
All my ?? is out of damn sight
Look, why the fuck I was packed so tight
Nigga I ain't Mike I'm Michael
Think I'm in the wrong spot
Not only do I have on black, its too hot
But why my K motherfucker ain't shot
I got those halos, hello, motherfucker shit nigga, I'm talking to you
Slap the clip in the tech 22.
Let the shit fly ???
Now I got a clue, where the fuck I'm at
Shawty want the tech and a nigga want the bud
Nigga just bleedin', motherfucker out of blood
Looking at me smilin', asking me what
I got cuts, but cuts got down
?? shit I can't tell
Went from dwellin' in hell on earth, now I'm living inhaling hell</pre>
