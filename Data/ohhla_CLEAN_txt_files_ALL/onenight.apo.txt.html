[Chorus: Apocalipps]
All I need is one night, to twist you out
Wine you, dine you, then kick you out
All I need is one night, to make you moan
Backshot your ass to death, then take you home
All I need is one night, you know I'm bringing the rubbers
And she don't want no limp dick, she want a chump young lover

[Apocalipps]
Your man playing games again, clowning out
He won't put that time in, and never take you out
Introducing the one night man, I go for 24 hours
I'm yours baby, it's a one night stand
We both know the deal, cuz when you creepin', it's real
And if we fuck on the first night, you know how it feel
God damn shorty, how you hold that ass in them heels
Your body is like a deadly weapon, you should keep it concealed
Here's the deal, we ain't gotta leave the club together
We ain't gotta meet up at the diner and get grub together
Long as we back in the telly, in the tub together
And that's the plan, ma, you wit it? ("Whatever")
Ok, let's play, put your legs behind your head
Pull your hair, power pump, stack the fuck up your bed
One eight hundred, dial a matress, you gotta get a new frame
Bitches think I'm on Viagra, man, this shit ain't a game
So if you wanna orgasm, just call on Lipps
Now I don't care if you a double d, I get all them tits
If you a big body girl, I get all them hips
Get a fish that wanna trick, and spend all them chips
Fat bitches, yo, I make a killing, they say
My dick is Miller Lite, it taste great, with less filling

[Chorus]

[Apocalipps]
Now if you looking for a husband, I respect that thought
It's not me, I don't know what the fuck you thought
Don't get me wrong, I respect a sister, but not tonight
I'm looking for a bitch that'll give her pussy up quicker
Drunk off liquor, I'm here, ma, the one night stand man
Shorty let me beat the pussy up like Bam Bam
Bigelow, I'm a muthafuckin' jigalo
Give her dick, give her dough? Never that, nigga, no
I keep whores in my house, ask my neighbor, yo
Type to stick up for a bitch, you Captain Save-A-Hoe
I'm focused, I got my business cards
Nine inches of pleasure, my dick stay hard
And you tired of the arguing, you sick of fighting?
You got shitted on so much, you got your liquor license
You can call on Lipps, if you want some excitement
And I knock the pussy out, fast like Mike Tyson
And if you like it rough, then your ear I'm biting
Yeah, breakfast is on you, and of course you buying

[Chorus]

[Apocalipps]
Now you can catch the one night stand man at the bar
Or at the drive-through, I pull up on the side of you car
Or you can catch me at the weed spot, copping them jars
Never catch me with another chick, seed in the park
One night stand man, doing one night at a time
I let you know from the jump, if you don't like it, then fine
You get your girl back tomorrow, but tonight, she's mine
She tired of the five and, she wanna try out the nine
Right from behind, long cock, right in her spine
Bet you ain't even know that this bitch could wind
You ain't know she could suck a golfball through a straw
Sit your nuts in her mouth, and she'll gargle your balls
Had you doing shit you never did, freaking off in public
Hitting spots that your man could never get
My dick is like a revolver, cuz it never jam
And I'm yours tonight, the one night stand man
