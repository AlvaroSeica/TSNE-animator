[Chorus: Eligh]
Have you ever been in love with someone you never met
Perhaps she is the one you made up when you were ten
Imagining that kiss and tears are welling up within
cause she never made the ball and so I face the wall again
But my songbird sings with the name Regina
Her voice reminds me of pain, pleasure, leisure
In pictures mad mean, she's a lovely creature
I wish to meet her one day, to smile and be shy

[Eligh]
I've been touched by the way you sing as I know so many agree
As I lower this pen to paper to search for something to say to a crush!
Your voice it trances and dances across my eardrums like brush
in the Sierra it's not, lust just a playful measure to send
And I'ma sing through this and my pipe issuing that light
to might crown that emotion that rush in on brow
To call myself a fan, a Music Man to my essence
From the cheap seats of retreat for me on my plane rides home from my shows
and anxiety strikes, but your playful personality
exudes common interludes to life for me to smile to
So I'd like to take a while to, say
I got a crush on you

[Chorus]

[Eligh]
A songbird sings with the name Regina
Her voice reminds me of pain, pleasure, leisure
In pictures mad mean, she's a lovely creature
I wish to meet her one day, to smile and be shy

I'm relatively late when it comes to knowing your career
But I know my ears do not lie to me and the words you write are clear
And your focus is quite embarrassing really but I'm not shy
and I'm like "Why am I shy with pen?" I let it go then I fly by night
and find you remind you your voice is special then pleasing
Inside it's easing in fact, intriguing that's why I manifest
this meeting - just a spirit admiring from a distance
Start fire pistons off my engine revs for you

Reginaaaaa, Reginaaaaa, Reginaaaaa, Reginaaaaa</pre>
