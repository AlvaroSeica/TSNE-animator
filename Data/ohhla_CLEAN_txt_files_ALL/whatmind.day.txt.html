Yeah..
Motherfuckin Dayton Family G
Rockin this motherfucker once again
You can't fuck with me
I'm here to tell you what the fuck is on my mind
Maniac, lunatic psycho, and all that dope shit nigga

What's on my mind is a motherfuckin murder
Ask your motherfuckin mammy did I hurt her
What's on my mind is victims in the baskets
Taking place in some motherfucker's caskets
What's on my mind is a rape in progress
I got my dick in between some bitch breasts
What's on my mind is a knife at a hoe's throat  
I took her gold, her pussy, and her mink coat
What's on my mind is a motherfuckin tra-ge-dy
Two-hundred, to two-fifty cash Roley's
What's on my mind is the teacher in the classroom
She say no pass, I asked to use the bathroom
I pulled my dick out then I pissed on the floor
She tried to run, slipped and fell, stupid hoe
I shook my dick off then I walked out the do'
I hear a voice, "Don't come into my class no mo'."
What's on my mind is a bum eatin out the trash
Asked for a quarter, I kicked him in his dusty ass
What's on my mind is my uncle said, "Stay in school."
Know what I told him? Go suck a dick you old fool
What's on my mind is a little honkey called me daddy
You want to find him? Take a look up under my Caddy
What's on my mind is crime without a doubt
For me to know and for you to find out
What's on my mind is a raid in my dopehouse
Ten rushed in ain't none of you bitches leavin out
They got on vests, I guess they think that I'm a sleeper
But that's like paper to my motherfuckin street sweeper
One was a bitch, so I got some boilin hot
Same water that I use to hook up my rocks
Put it on his chest and then I heard her scream
I bust a nut, as if it was a wet dream
What's on my mind is a blind lady in a street
She asked for help I said first you gotta suck my meat
What's on my mind is human peace across the fuckin nation
Pickin cotton fuck yeah I like the situation
When it's low, so I gotta move fast
Pulled out my whip hit him hard cracker move fast
What's on my mind is a rookie hangin from a string
We made it through it, let's see if deez hoes can hang
What's on my mind is some black leather player gloves
I think its mandatory every time I kill a scrub
Cause in Flint, they really really want me bad
Get some prints I can hear them yeah we got his ass
But that's okay, and everything gon' be fine
I know I'm tough and that's enough of what's on my mind

What's on my mind?
A motherfucking tooting spree
What's on my mind?
A motherfucking murder

What's on my mind is another violent tooting spree
Nobody trusts Ira I was suited up a key (McKie!)
What's on my mind is a cane house in my neighborhood
Walked on the porch and I-R-A knocked on the fucking wood
What's on my mind is a hoe answering the fucking door
She said who is it, I said yo can I speak to Joe?
She said you got the wrong house I said I know that snitch
I cracked a grip, pulled out my gat and then I popped that bitch
What's on my mind is a dead body on the floor
I shot that bitch through the glass on the front door
What's on my mind is the cane in the basement
I licked my fingers hit the cane and I taste it
What's on my mind is three niggas in the next room
If they don't break they're gonna make some dead bodies soon
What's on my nine is the guts from a bloody man
And the finger that was blown off his fucking hand
What's on my mind is a bloody ass Doberman
Put him in a trench and sent his body to the government
What's on my mind is commercials on my TV
About the army yeah them bitches want to draft me
What's on my mind is a bitch climbing in my bed
Don't want no sex I want to dig into this bitch's head
What's on my mind is a little baby being drug
From a deuce by the bumper like a little rug
What's on my mind is a motherfucking blood bath
Two stanky bitches must have asked me for my autograph
What's on my mind is a bitch's head up in a tree
And why you kill her G? That bitch should never spoke to me
What's on my mind is a cane slanger fixing to die
He wore no colors but that bitch disrespected I
What's on my mind is a hooker in an alley ditch
That hoe was dead but I still gisummed on the bitch
What's on my mind is a spade up on the fucking wall
The last crackhead smit it with an eight ball
What's on my mind is a room full of sacking hoes
I whooping they ass taking they cash dropping elbows
But thats okay and everything going be fine
I know I'm tough and thats enough of whats on my mind

What's on my mind?
A motherfucking tooting spree
Bdrapa!
What's on my mind?
A motherfucking murder
Bdrapa!
