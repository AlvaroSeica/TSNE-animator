[Hen-Gee]
Dear Homie, what's the haps since you're up in the sky?
With God by your side, homie what's it like?
I know you're being treated right
No more worries, plus you're being heard G
I guess you know niggaz is still tripping
I don't know why, they see future in it
We're heading for self-destruction
Cause my young niggaz can't function
Only thing I can do is pray
And thank God, for another day
Yes Homie, it's rough down here
I gotta watch my back, cause it's hard being black
If it ain't the other, it's my own color
Trying to work me, trying to hurt me
Ain't no L-O-V-E, please tell me why, dear homie

[Chorus: Hen-Gee]
Dear Homie

[Ice-T]
Dear Homie, gang-banging ain't joke
And I'm looking over you, loc
Always knew there was fools out to get me
I didn't even hear the gunshots til after the slugs hit me
I grabbed for my chest and my neck, hoping
When my head hits the ground my skull busted open
You used to ask for my advice
Well Dear Homie, dying ain't nothing nice
And the place I'm at is over-packed
With young blacks who crash crack and gats
I can only pray, you don't come this way
You gotta stay alive, you got a kid G
I feel you, partner but I worry a lot
Cause to get paid back, you bust shots
I know you're trying to comfort me
But I don't want no company, Homie

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Dear Homie
I don't want no company, homie

[Hen-Gee]
Dear Homie, even though you're gone
I still feel your presence
Sometimes I can't sleep, cause I just can't see
Reality like it really should be seen
I still reminisce on how we used to kick it
Strolling the yard, just hanging out together
Down for whatever, whenever
Now I'm hoping, you're seeing the true friend in me
Cause Road Dogs, is what we were meant to be

[Ice-T]
Dear Homie, you used to call me O.G.
Now you really gotta look up to me
Cause the place I'm at, is way high in the sky
I didn't want to die
But the life I lived was just to reckless
Too many bad marks on God's checklist
And many many brothers will go out
Just trying to get that hardcore street clout
But the street reps final test
Is when you're lying in a coffin with your hands folded on your chest
And then you hear the girls cry
And then you hear the brothers lie
Talking about how down you was
Then the next week they're back on the street
They cold forgot you cous'
Don't wanna see you on your back
So for me stay sucker free, cause you don't need that, Homie

[Outro: Ice-T]
Dear homie, dear homie
You know I miss you, Homie</pre>
