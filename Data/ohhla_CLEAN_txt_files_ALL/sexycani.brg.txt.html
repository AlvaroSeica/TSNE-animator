{SEX-Y, CAN, I?}

[Yung Berg - Intro] (Ray J)
Yeah! Ray... (Yeaaaaaah)
We out here
It's young boss...Knockout
(Yeaaa-yeaaaaaaaah)
All he wanna know is..
{SEX-Y, CAN, I?}
First round, ladies!

[Ray J]
Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl, how you shake it got a nigga like (OHHHH!)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is {SEX-Y, CAN, I?}
Sexy, can I, hit it from the front?
Then I hit it from the back, know you like it like that
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the flo'
Then we chill for a second, then we back at it some mo'
Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl, how you shake it got a nigga like (OHHHH!)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is {SEX-Y, CAN, I?}

[Yung Berg]
'Ey, waddup, lil mama? It's ya boy Yung'n
G5 dipped in Louis Vuitton luggage
'Ey, gotta love it, ya boy so fly
All the ladies go (OHHH) when the nigga go by
Gucci on the feet, Marc Jacob on the thigh
She wanna ride or die witcha boy in the Chi
That's right - so I let her kiss the prince
Her boyfriend, she ain't missed him since
Ya dig?

[Ray J] (Yung Berg)
Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl, how you shake it got a nigga like (OHHHH!)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is {SEX-Y, CAN, I?}
Sexy, can I, keep it on the low?
Got a girl at the crib, we can take it to the mo-mo
You can bring a friend, or, you can ride solo
Let me get my camera, so we can take a photo
Ooooh (Now go shawty, go shawty)
Baby, when we make love, it's like ooooooh
(I don't know what your man is like, but shawty all I wanna know is...)
Sexy, can I?
Sexy, can I, visit you at work?
While you slidin down the pole, no panties, no shirt
Then you climb back up the pole, then you drop and do the splits
How you make that pussy talk, baby damn you on some real shit
Ooooh (Now go shawty, go shawty)
I make it rain in the club like OOOOOOOH
(I don't know what your man is like, but baby all I wanna know is...)
Sexy, can I?
Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl, how you shake it got a nigga like (OHHHH!)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is {SEX-Y, CAN, I?}

[Yung Berg]
You know what it is..
She ain't concerned with, who ya boy's hittin, or who Ray's melon
So when I give it to her, I know that she ain't tellin
See I'm a go getta and she a go get-it
You already know she a.. {SEX-Y, CAN, I}
Sexy, can I, send for you red-eye
Fresh out the pool, no towel, let it air-dry
And if you ain't fuckin tonight
Then, you can watch our tour bus go by

[Ray J]
Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl, how you shake it got a nigga like (OHHHH!)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is {SEX-Y, CAN, I?}

Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the flo'
Then we chill for a second, then we back at it some mo'!
Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl, how you shake it got a nigga like (OHHHH!)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is {SEX-Y, CAN, I?}
I just wanna have some fun...

[Yung Berg - Outro]
You know I wanna have some too!
(Ay, I said, can I just have some fuuuun?)
We about to turn the mansion out
and we can do it with the cameras out
{SEX-Y, CAN, I?}</pre>
