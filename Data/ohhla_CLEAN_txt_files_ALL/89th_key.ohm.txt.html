Ohmega Watts in the place y'all
Lightheaded, Stro is up in the place y'all

Keep this recording

[Stro]
I was born a soul child, learned to walk on the bap-beat
Runnin' on a multi-track meat, but I'm no athlete
The wax seems like a career, the piece of the puzzle that brought me here
I've been diggin for years!
To find the rhythm combined with good feelings
Revolution per minute 45, to 33 and the 3rd
Up to now, everything that I've heard
I could easily describe a word (uh-ha)
I'm standin in the shower, dust up to the roof
I guess sometimes you gotta get dirty to find the truth
And the proof is in this record i'm holdin
A blank white label, deep ?? of golden
I put it on slipmat, and act as a spiritual God
The headnod, provoked by the spirit inside
Can't leave 'em behind, it's always at the front of my crate
You got soul then I know all of y'all can relate
For real

[Ohmega Watts]
I found a key, now searchin for a relax ya fix
Maybe a treasure chest, filled with ?? of gifts
Like.. When I.. dig in the crates to find breaks
And samples that inspire me to reshape and create
A new form of sound (Yeah!) usin my machines and tools
But got soul that stand out among a circle of fools
Who chase, ?? tresures and quick highs
From the heart I speak truth and thats no lie
So! Back to the program, i'm my own man
Shape by gods hands, unique design under the wine
To pleasure in my existence, for instance
?? styles, so each find life, to spot a sentence of death
And i've come to find there's more to life then just livin givin
I've seen signs of wonders and received the new beginning
To all you out searchin for that life treasure
The evidence is more closer than ever
.........And thats the find

[Chorus]
I'm searchin', for my soul in here
Creating somethin new from older heads
Gimme the light, and let it shine
Then press rewind, we all lookin for something to find
(Ohmega)
Hey yo Stro, I found it, a rhythm to break through
(Stro)
Hey yo Ohmega, I found it, a song to save you

Keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin
'Till we find that something to find

[Stro]
We go inside, with the spirit divine
Out to find those with similar minds
That all starts with a ??, to brush on, even with dust on
Ohmega Watts, tell 'em how we do this production

[Ohmega Watts]
With a little touch of jazz and the styles to match
Were a class a act, to good times, we bringin it back
To when it was fresh to say 'def'
Now 80's were a mess, but MC's 'spose to make 'em 'yes yes'

[Stro]
I take seven 12 inches, put 'em in the line
And get seven more records, thats hard to find

[Ohmega Watts]
I do a bit of the same, and though quiet is kept
I do it for the love, and not just to get a rep

[Stro]
And that's cool, my man, it's all a part of the plan

[Ohmega Watts]
Find the source of inspiration so united we stand

[Stro]
Back to back

[Ohmega Watts]
Side to side

[Both]
Soon we all will see
We be the Awesome 2, most definatly

[Chorus]
I'm searchin', for my soul in here
Creating somethin new from older heads
Gimme the light, and let it shine
Then press rewind, we all lookin for something to find
(Ohmega)
Hey yo Stro, I found it, a rhythm to break through
(Stro)
Hey yo Ohmega, I found it, a song to save you

Keep on searchin'
Keep on searchin
'Till we find that something to find

[Beat plays for the next 2 and half minutes and Stro freestyles on the piano]</pre>
