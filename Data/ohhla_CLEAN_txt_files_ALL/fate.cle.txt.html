[Intro: Memo]
Yeah, okay
Must have been fate man
Yeah

[Verse 1: Memo]
Just across town there's a guy laying in a bed
Who just had a sex with a waitress he just met
While she's gone to the bathroom, he reminisces
Off of a night that actually turned out alright
More than usual he's lonely
Used to staying home, mainly watching movies with his homeys
But this evening was the night that his luck changed for him
Out of boredom, he was out doing groceries
Bumped into this girl in the candy aisle
Asked her what's her name, girl laughed and smiled
Now imagine her baby looked smashing
Attractive, japanime type of passion
Type of ass, you'd love to tap if you had the cash
And if you're the mack even then you'd cum twice in her
They had a nice dinner, hit the beach for some night swimming
Then they hit the club for a dance and some light drinking
After that they hit the crib spot so they could kick back
Smoke some pot, take their clothes off

[Chorus: Memo}
Fate is a strange thing, put your self in the way of the world
Fate is a strange thing, put your self in the way of the world
Fate is a strange thing, put your self in the way of the world
Fate is a strange thing, put your self in the way of the world

[Verse 2: Second Thought]
A young man stands at a microphone
Mad skills with a pen so he writes his own
Cold nights alone, when his lights is on
He immerses himself in a frightening zone
And that's when he feels it come
When he's there with a snare and the perfect drum
And that it all comes back you see
'Cuz for the last six months he's been practising
He wanna crack the scene, gotta hit 'em with his best shot
In the booth, one take like S-Dot
Beat drops and he nails the shit
Yeah he never would have failed at this
So the track gets pressed, guess what comes next
Time to put that shit to the test
And so they play it on the radio
The whole world goes nuts "Hey way to go!"

[Bridge: Second Thought]
It must have been fate
Yo they really loved that track man
Must have been fate

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Cale Sampson]
Downtown a single mom wishes
Her luck turns around 'cuz her life just isn't
Moving forward, stuck doing dishes
With only one income isn't what she envisioned
Different men come and go but they don't give her
The love she deserves, she knows they won't deliver
Every relationship she's been hurt
But it's only built strength deep within her
She needs it, all her family's gone
Now all she has is a little boy to keep her strong
Always be there for him, sacrificing
The rest of her life just to support them
Truth is, she can barely afford to
Even though she probably works more than you
Her fate, ain't to follow in the footsteps
Of the family tree or end up depressed
No way, she's gonna break the pattern
Best day of her life was the day she had him
And one day she's gonna own a home
And he'll be the first one to graduate she knows

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Nfact}
When I ask why, too blind to see
Why I can't get by and it's probably me
Content with the pain entirely
Wanna blame it all on society
'Cuz I chill all day on the corner drunk
With my crew in the same old corner funk
Say we gonna get rich, how we gonna stunt
Chop blaze, shop viles, be a baller y'all
Now twenty years passed with the same old fib
The same old crib, complaining about the same old shit
Still dreaming how to change all this
Brother watch years go by and think of all the things you miss ( c'mon )

[Outro: Nfact]
Fate is a strange thing, put your self in the way of the world
Fate is a strange thing, put your self in the way of the world</pre>
