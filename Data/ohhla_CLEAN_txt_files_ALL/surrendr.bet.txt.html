Ohhhh-hooooo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, heyy, heyy... Mmmm...

I'm waving my flag, I surrender 
I feel it's love this time 
His kisses are warm, and oh so tender  
And I think the time is right  

But I've been hurt so many times 
I don't wanna be flying blind 
Not at this time (not at this time) 
In my lifetime (in my lifetime) 
So I- I'm.. 

I'm waving my flag, I surrender 
I think its love this time 
As far back as I can remember 
He said he was that guy 

And I've been wounded so many times 
All that I could think in my mind 
Was not at this time (not at this time) 
In my lifetime (in my lifetime) 
But, I-I-I.. I... 

I need someone who's good at opening doors
Someone to give me what I need and more (I need)  
Someone who's lookin out for me (I need)  
Someone who let's me be free (I need) 
Someone who has my interest at heart (I need) 
Someone who'll love me right from the start (I need) 
With all, with all his heart
With all of his heaaa-AAAAAAAAAAAAAA-art 

I'm waving my flag, I surrender 
I feel it's love this time 
His kisses are warm, and oh so tender  
And I think the time is right  

I'm waving my flag, I surrender 
I think its love this time 
As far back as I can remember 
He said he was that guy</pre>
