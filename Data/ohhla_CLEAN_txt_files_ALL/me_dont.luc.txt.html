[Lucky Luciano]
What
Hun
What
Hun

[Chorus: Lucky Luciano]
They say I drank too much, but
Me don't care
Me don't care
Me don't care
They say I smoke too much, but
Me don't care
Me don't care
Me don't care
They say I spend too much, but
Me don't care
Me don't care
Me don't care
They say I party too much, but
Me don't care
I'm a youngster getting money, living like a boss playa

[Verse 1]
These lavish habits that I have inside me
Make me think I'm crazy, but in fact, I might be
I'm a drank all the drank that they got at the bar
And I'm a smoke til the store run out of cigars
So go wreck my car, then buy me anothun'
Then pull up to the club, valle on buttons
So I'm in the Seven series, I done trash the Caddy
Hold up, where my money at, girl ("It's right here, daddy")
I'm at Sacs, spit that, but my pants still sag
Tryna blow in advance at Vegas on crash
Forty-five days straight, then sleep for two
Wake up, then bring it back, win somethin' brand new
But yeah, I'm tryin' get richer, to buy a new livah
Some talk about ballin', but I does it Godzilla
My label can't handle it, too much of a problem
But me don't care, Lucky bring in dollars

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Call me a high roller, tight flight flow'er
Sittin' sideways in a pearl-white Rover
Pour me up a cup and watch me act a bad bone
Luciano, now that's a damn fool
Too much money in my pocket, I'm on it
Flew to L.A. today for nothin', I promise
Somebody stop him, he out of control
Lean Greens, Point Mall, beating up Georgio's
$700 E-V's, new jeans
And he got the shoes to much, shit, me too clean
Got the rolli on the arm, pouring Don Perignon
Make my room service bill lookin' like a car note (Catch up)
Ha ha
Take a toast to that (Cheers)
Pimpin' ain't dead, I got it on the track
I'm focused, man, see my poster, man
I got a bulk all on a leash, you can quote me, man
So don't ask me why I party all night
Grab a hand full of hundreds, then set it on fire
I'm Lucky
Take a picture of me
Don't be hating on me cause I make the crowd love me
Got a damn quota
That I gotta meet
Bottom over here at Santa Monica beach
Leave a message on a cellphone, I'm on vacation
I'm ballin' all day, that's why they hatin'

[Repeat Chorus]
