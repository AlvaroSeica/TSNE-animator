[Chorus 2X]
Bottom all the way to top
And it seem like a struggle so I had to get out
No doubt 
I'm bout my paper so I had to smash
150 on my dash 
So you know I'm rollin fast
All about my cash

Repeat

[Mike D]
Since 16 I can remember a Benz on her
Now I'm out in Sunny California
On that marijuana
I'm talkin an ole G
And the drank got me leaning
Put the 84's on a '64 and show em how the gangsta leanin
I was at the bottom now I'm at the top
Switched up my style and they don't like me now
I put it in yo face that's why I stay on your mind
And y'all can keep haitin but I'ma stay on the grind
Can't slack one second can't lack one minute
Ain't got a million yet daddy but the plot thicken
With that said I will kill niggas dead 
Go to playing with my bread
And I'ma show you how to play it
Pass out four and a half 
The hood a get ya (Third Ward)
Somebody should have told that boy I'm bout business
24/7 around the clock
That's why I get nonstop 
From the Bottom to the Top (yea)

[Chorus 2X]
Bottom all the way to top
And it seem like a struggle so I had to get out
No doubt 
I'm bout my paper so I had to smash
150 on my dash 
So you know I'm rollin fast
All about my cash

[Z-Ro]
No weapon will prospeer that's formed against me(formed against me)
So you can pull the trigger til the clips are empty(clips are empty)
Or you can tie a rope in a noose and even lynch me(even lynch me)
If GOD ain't ready for me to go you cant send me(bitch)
You crab in a bucket holdin on to my leg(on to my leg)
Don't wanna see me make over the edge 
I'm full speed ahead
Nothin can stop me
Even if the prison block me
I'm a press 100,000 and sell each and every copy
From a Jalopy to a Jag
No more doing bad
Who go carry all the money I can't fit in my pants
We eat offer 130 hard hits 
Got a 30 yard 6
For you dirty fraud tricks
Candy doors open and close 
On the van and Magnum and the Lac
I remeber where I came from and I ain't goin back
I ain't talkin about the hood
I'm talkin about when it wasn't all good
Understood

[Chorus 2X]
Bottom all the way to top
And it seem like a struggle so I had to get out
No doubt 
I'm bout my paper so I had to smash
150 on my dash 
So you know I'm rollin fast
All about my cash

[Z-Ro]
Ain't no time to play 
Pull it in perspective
Time for hoe checkin bitch made nigga wreckin and collecting
Memory weapon selecting
Cause a mind is a terrible thing to waste
I'ma keep my mind in they face
Cause I'm thinkin throwed making decisions 
On how to come up on anothe million
Even though my people wanna hate 
I'm in love with my state, yes I am
How they feel abou TexasI don't give a damn
From the Bottom all the way to the top of another sticky situation
Too many women wanna have relations
I'm coastin
Inside of my trunk is a big commotion
Twelve 12's ripping it wide open
Don't make me jump executive up in this bitch
Double breasted three piece suit with fedora and gator wing tips
Everyday of the week I sleep on satin and silk sheets 
Cause I got em
At the top all the way from the bottom

[Chorus]
Bottom all the way to top
And it seem like a struggle so I had to get out
No doubt 
I'm bout my paper so I had to smash
150 on my dash 
So you know I'm rollin fast
All about my cash

Bottom all the way to top
And it seem like a struggle so I had to get out
No doubt 
I'm bout my paper so I had to smash
150 on my dash 
So you know I'm rollin 

[Chorus 2X]
Bottom all the way to top
And it seem like a struggle so I had to get out
No doubt 
I'm bout my paper so I had to smash
150 on my dash 
So you know I'm rollin fast
All about my cash</pre>
