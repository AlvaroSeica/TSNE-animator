[Intro: Live Squad]
And ya know it goes down
Queens town in the motherfucker
Mo cheese, more cheese please
Need the cheese ya know what im sayin for 95
Know what i mean
Extra cheese

[Verse 1: Stretch]
I need my pockets unfolded, motherfuckin grand criminal
Using a pull to always know whos got the dough, get the stash, kick it
Quick to blast yo, then I'm raising up
Aint this a bitch? It's me cops dream of blazing up
I'm still kind of lost, I gives a fuck I needs the cash yo
They always harass me though, suckers try to fuck up my flow
And tho its real, niggas packin steel and I'm buckin em down
The four pound spittin ruckas up in terror town
Young Gunz, never the ones, we bring you drama
And you knew it when the coroner had to call yo mama
Nigga money dont stop, I got the cash now I'm in the breeze
And it was all for the cheese (the cheese)

[Verse 2: Majesty](Stretch)
Now blood stains in the street lanes leave my brain stained
The crazy stress and pain make it hard to maintain
Yo check it, you know we struggle and try to bubble
We juggle, and never player hate and if your reppin kid we ????
Respect dues to the thoro crews comin through
The wreckin crews, where niggas front and light the fuze&gt;
(The mode is set, when its over shit is gettin wet)
Boy you'll come back and find a body layin fuckin dead
Ghetto motivation, crazy in the hanger
Underaverage financial living, turn to a slanger
Slinger of the crack games
(Yeah dope or coke spot)
No turnin back, in it to win it, living your life hot
Huh, peepin game for ghetto fame, see people shot
Gather some street smarts, grabbin ya shiney glock
Cleanin clocks of ???? in Fishkill
Cubans found laying dead for days, fuckin faces pale
Slippin, got to yang and bang, them thugs done did they thang
Done caugth a meal ticket never goin broke again
50 bricks and 300 G's, just back up off these
Ima be stompin Queens grasp and caught a bunch of cheese!

[Outro]
Uh, know what I'm sayin
More cheese please, extra cheese nigga...
extra cheese nigga, extra cheese
Thats the Springfield Mob, YGz, and we out</pre>
