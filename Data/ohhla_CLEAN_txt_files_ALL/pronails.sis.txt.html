[Chorus - 8X]
Got her toes done up
With her finger nails matchin'

[Verse One: Kid Sister]
Shake it up up
Rock your body and
Make it knock knock
When you're partyin'
Take a break break
In the audience
Do your footwork break
And stop again
I'm lookin sharp
You can't compete
With a champ
Steady flickin'
I'm holdin down
That ?
Aye, rhinestones
All in they face
Gold charms
And paper chase
Talk smack
From around the way
Gotta put
These chicken heads
In they place
I ain't rockin'
No stupid bapes
Ain't trippin'
I'll juke all day
I ain't slippin'
Cause either way
When I hit the block
All the people say

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Kanye West]
Aye, yo this mutherfuckas jammin'
I'm on it it's an anthem
Who is that in the Phantom?
Please no cameras
They gone have me
On Concrete Loop in my pajamas
To hide the goods
I would need pants
Big as Hammers
I be tippin' them dancers
They be sayin' I'm handsome
I was pretty before the dough
But now I'm just the man
You remind me of my old chick
On that eighty four shit
Oh shit
Did you see the way
She got her toes did?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Kid Sister]
Girls be
So thirsty thirsty
Fast forward
To the end of my song
And say third
Verse me, verse me
Whenever I hit block I see
Tricks try
To rehearse me hearse me
From manicure
Sets to silky weaves
They be
So grimy, nasty, bogus
Jermy, dirty
Uh, oh
Shol did
You ain't slick
Naw, let the pioneer
Blast my ass
Wait a minute
Hold up
Bubble letters
On my butt say
"fresh"
Oops I'ma go
Nails like whoa
Acrylic base
Top all gold
Colors on my nails
To the paint on my toes
Stay fresh
I'm accustomed to gold

[Chorus]</pre>
