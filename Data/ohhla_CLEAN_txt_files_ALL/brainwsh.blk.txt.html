[chorus]
Tryin' man I'm tryin' lies and lies ain't buyin' (?)
where to I go, where do I go?

tryin' yes I'm strivin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
how does it go?

[blackalicious]
Walk, to a time when minds was one
Came into creation as itself, mankind was born
Step into the eye of the storm, survive as pawn
Casualties of evil men, slidin' the blinders on
Lies will spawn, hey are you concious was side you're on?
Is the total story told or is it they hide you from?
Why are we on the brink of murderin' more innocent
Now we slide (?), we're patriotic and so militant
Get ya ride on, rise on, take a look
They done even takin' righteous laws, rewrote the books
To benefit the prize they got they eyes on
Minds run rampant, to be revealed when the proper time comes
Brainwashers

[chorus]

Brainwashers
It's when you think how they wanna think
Speak how they wanna speak, Livin' in defeat
When you don't wanna question what they teach, as the truth
With no proof, with the fear of burnin' in eternal heat
When your programmed not to be your own man, but a sheep
Bein' heared as they word it, so you think it ain't free
When you sleep in a deep sleep standin' on your feet
When your beat makin' ends meat, raw, thin and they see (?)
Now your labeled obsolete, workin' for relief (?)
In the heat on bare feet, smile showin' off your teeth
Good grief, it's a ____(?) how they work it
And they jerk it, while they surf
Plus the surf keeps the _____ (?) underneath the brainwashers

[chorus] (several times)

[studio guy]
You just keep playing. Can you bring that level up in my earphones?
And you bring their level up in my chairs, cause I'm playing with sticks
and I'm drowning 'em out, so if you can give them more of this
Yeah, you can bring that in even more. Bring up
Yeah. You guys play. Yeah, that's perfect
