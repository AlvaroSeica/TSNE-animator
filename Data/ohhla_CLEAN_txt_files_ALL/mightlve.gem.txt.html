[Big Gemini]
Ah
I once heard someone say
What we do in life
Echoes in eternity
Yeah
And in that case
Through what I'm doin' right here
I might
I might live on

Chorus: Big Gemini
Pain is life, and life ain't long
After all of the lights are gone
When this mic is gone
The only reason that I write this song
Is some piece of me might live on
I might live on
Pain is life, and life ain't long
After all of the lights are gone
When my mic is gone
The only reason that I write this song
Is some piece of me might live on
I might live on

[Big Gemini {Bebop in background}]
(Verse 1)
Every rapper wanna
Be remembered and never forgot
And be felt like Big and Pac
Or Jay-Z and Nas
And be held as one of the greats
In they hip hop hall of fame {Yeah, yeah}
If there's such a thang
And I don't really know if there is
But if there is, sometimes, I wonder what it takes to get in
Actually, I don't care cause I don't do it for fame
Regardless of how it feels when they yellin' my name {Yellin' my name}
And when they stop me in my path and
Ask for autograph
Hell yeah, it feels good, I'll enjoy while it last {Oh, oooh}
Shit, I love what I do, I'm sure someone loves it too
Cause I ain't moved thirty thousand units based on my looks {Oh no}
And I know that ain't shit when you compare me to others
Yeah, I'd love to do Snoop Dogg numbers
But that probably never happen
Only Latins that went platinum
Was the Punisher and Joe
And that's just to my understandin'
And maybe Cypress Hill did, but I'm not for sure
I know there was a few out there to hit gold
Combined all together
You can count 'em on your fingers
And though there ain't that many
It's still hard to be distinguished
And I ain't doubtin' mine, so if I just tell it how it is
Cause in my eyes
I'm a golden platinum diamond on this bitch {Oh yeah}
But when all of this is over
We gon' see if I
Was added to a list or
I just died tryin'
To get on

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
And ain't tryin' to
Be glorified, I just wanna be felt
Hopefully right now, when not after my death
When I take my last breath, ain't none of this comin' {Oh no}
That's why I reap the benefits now, and leave it for someone
I don't plan to die young, but
Who ever does
When the Lord wants you next, there's somethin' you can't outrun {Yeah}
So I'm a get it while He lets me
And try to make history
And make my people proud even though odds is against me
That's why I spit it every time like it's the last in the booth
I know most don't understand and ask, "What is the youth?"
I'm tryin' to leave somethin' behind that's
More than a song
A little piece of me that
Might live on
Cause when this all fades to black, and nothin' remains
And the only thing left
Is a picture in the frame
Let my family gather around and
Tell 'em, "Push play"
Cause then, I'll eternally stay, and live through words that I say

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Bebop
If the Lord gon' call on me by the end of the night
Would you still remember my life, now hold up
Cause everybody gotta go
They're on the same road
It's only a matter of time
Cause when this life is gone (Life is gone)
I might live on (Might live on)
This life end, only when I move, on
I'll be singing this song

Repeat Chorus

[Big Gemini]
Yeah
Gemi-
Ni
Ah
History in the makin'
Yeah
I might live on
I might live on
Yeah
I might live on
Yeah
Yeah</pre>
