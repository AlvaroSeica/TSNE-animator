Yeah, say what
Now how the god damn pot go and call the kettle black?  that bull shit
Yo, but this ain't though
Chapter 7, Verse 1, Attention

[chorus]

All Balls Don't Bounce, some balls roll and some balls hang
and some people have a ball doin' they thang
now what's the result? Your life is biased
all one-sided surrounded by liars

trials and tribs
it's all ad-libs, and all breakin' you a coupla ribs
now what if I breaks the tail on the lizard
is it gonna grow back?
it is and you know that
but that ain't the case
I picture the place
I capture a kodak and show dat face
you're just a shit stain on the draws of life
and the trials of life, and the styles of life
you won't be happy 'till you lost your life
or lose your mind, or die of boredom
or try to kill 'em all and let your God sort 'em
better earn your keep, and learn to leap
or burn in your sleep
tryin' to get a little somethin, yo I peep
you bein devoted, but you shoulda let it seep thru the mask you sported

[with chorus in background]
you ended up a swiggler caught in a swiggle
just gimme the signal
and I'll state the terms
as long as I can be there with fate to change
you smokin sherm
or  whatever the name, you're a trivial part in a trivia game
now what's your aim? a presidential campaign
like Ross Perot, he lost it though
but he got a billion in da bank for show
oh me I'm po' and you like me
but I don't like you, nigga you all fronts
and I won't let one apple spoil the bunch
now get yo' hat &amp; get yo' coat
all afloat, we goin' back to the real
I got a question, answer me this
what if me and you got caught in a twist
and you accidentally got caught by the fist
what's the gist, or what's the justice
or better yet what if I had got busted
for tryin to go out like General Custer
well kiss yo' family, meet me at the juncture
better have a little bit a acupuncture
I reckon that you gonna have to smoke another bongload to get you enough 
to open your mouth
because I doubt that you know what it's really about

[Chorus]

heard you keep your jewels in a safe
that ain't safe with a $10 locket
I keep mines in between my front pockets
cause I'm a darkie and they want me
castrated, assassinated, well here's your merit
better wear it
with pride, just don't get all mushy inside
and don't get pushy
or wishy washy, your heart is squishy
when it should be strong, your tail is bushy
when you shouldn't even have one
do you want another big hit of the bong?
All Balls Don't Bounce, now you wanna get indignant
show your stupidity and act all ig'nant
now you got pigment, so you my kin
it's like the hand it's still on ice
so you might starve tryin' to carve you a slice
with a little brown rice and some black eye peas
or 2 black eyes and 2 broke knees
and 2 broke niggas tryin to steal the cheese
got family ties, your family's giving
your family tries, your family's living
your family croaks, dies of a stroke
and that's the end, but then you awoke
as a baby again
so in your next life you can be squabbler
and eat peach cobbler till you get fat
you can even live in a manshion or a wigwam
just remember all balls go flat
