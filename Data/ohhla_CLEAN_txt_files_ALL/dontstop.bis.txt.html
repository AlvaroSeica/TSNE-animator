[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
I tell a bitch, bitch shut the fuck up quick
No I didn't I'm just kidding
Nigga but I'm so pimping
Oh how rude of me, for those
That do not know of me
I rim ramp paint that perfect picture nigga
With my poetry
I go by bishop 2, been known to cross a few
What you mean bitches and a lot of special grooves
Like it's 92 I miss that old shit
Message for the kids don't grow up too quick
You got your adult life to do some stupid shit
Speaking of stupid shit, I drink until I puke and shit
It's just a fly sunny day and everything is ok
Hop and dipping down that 1 10 freeway

[Chorus: Bishop Lamont]
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle bizness
Don't waste no time chasing dumb bitches
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle bizness
Don't waste no time chasing dumb bitches
Why?
Cause she's a hoe, she's a slut, she's a tramp
She's a freak, you can have a different one
Every day of the week, hey

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
On and on and on until the beat's gone
Rest in peace to all my niggas
More cream will carry on
Been around since the old days
No matter how I hold place
Hold it down always
You know, you check my resume
My pedigree is good to go
Speak on my game tuck the chain
It's a thug life show
I'm feeling politic and I speak with true players
Nothing but true sayers so your bitch ass know
Screaming bishop once again with my foot in your throat
The way these bitches gag like they singing a note
I hit it from the back while she's sniffing on coke
I'm tryina join my summer drop the top and smoke
Get it, don't stop, I'm hot
And I'm swoll like hoe,
L.A. is the dream and your ass is whoa!

[Chorus: Bishop Lamont]
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle bizness
Don't waste no time chasing dumb bitches
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle bizness
Don't waste no time chasing dumb bitches
Why?
Cause she's a hoe, she's a slut, she's a tramp
She's a freak, you can have a different one
Every day of the week, hey

[Verse 3: Bishop Lamont]
Now now I know my shit don't chase these bitches
But when these bitches chasing you now what's a player to do
At time like feeling jake, dog them hoes and penetrate
Get that money celebrate,
Stack them racks and elevate
Venice beach and hit the streets
But first we hit them squad meats
 lost in hella deep
Ain't no tripping, set tripping
Cause I'm never out the slipping
More dogs, thug life, till I die
We representing

[Verse 4: Mopreme]
I keep it pimping like it's old town
Run shit, all round, skyscrapers, flat land
Close down, this is how a town with renegades on a run
Haters in my face that kill to take my place
My  is my boy it text me, bitches but naked
In the sauna sexy
And motherfuck anybody that will object it

[Chorus: Bishop Lamont]
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle bizness
Don't waste no time chasing dumb bitches
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle bizness
Don't waste no time chasing dumb bitches
Why?
Cause she's a hoe, she's a slut, she's a tramp
She's a freak, you can have a different one
Every day of the week, hey</pre>
