[Intro]
Geah, yo! Yo!
A-geah, geah, yeah
Zone 6, blood in blood out
How my boy?
Yo Chico I'ma tell you now man
You fuckin with the kid
Pat Breezy, Laflare Entertainment
We do it real big over here man
But check me out y'all

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
She's a very freaky gurl (yeah) don't bring her to mama (geah)
First you get her name (name) then you get the number (number)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of a Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of a Hummer

[Gucci Mane]
Let me set the record straight, hater you participate
Three girls with me like I'm goin on Elimidate
Say you got a man, but your man ain't here
The ice in my ear shine like a chandelier
Jumpin out the Phantom, don't you think I'm handsome
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Bet'cha baby daddy ain't icy like the kid be
Got your baby mama front seat of the Ferrari

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane Laflare, baby I'm that guy
Girls eyeballs pop when my Lamb' pass by
Huh, my money long as a limo
Just to show off I put my wrist out the window
Ride through the 6, little kids scream bingo
Fell off in the spot like "Ay let's mingle"
Then the DJ play my new single
The club got crazy, all the hoes went psycho

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Don't be conceited girl, I know you'll eat a girl
I know yo' secret girl, but I'm gon' keep it girl
Oh youse a college girl? Come be a Gucci girl
Oh youse a Gucci fan? Let's go to Gucci Land
You diggin Gucci Mane, cause only Gucci can
Drop a rack, pop your back with the rubberband
You diggin Gucci Gucci, let's do the oochie-coochie
Oh that's yo' girlfriend? Why don't you introduce me

[Chorus]</pre>
