[Intro: New Boyz]
Hot Chelle Rae, New Boyzzzz

[Hot Chelle Rae]
Let's get it on - yeah! Y'all can come along
Everybody drinks on me
Buy out the bar, just to feel like I'm a star
Now I'm thankin the academy
Missed my ride home
Lost my iPhone
I wouldn't have it any other way
If you're with me let me hear you say

[Chorus]
I like it like that! Hey windows down
Chillin with the radio on
I like it like that! Damn, the sun's so hot
Make the girls take it all off
I like it like that! Yeah, one more time
I can never get enough
of everybody - sing it right back
I like it like that

(I like it like that, I like it like that)

[Hot Chelle Rae]
'til the break of the dawn
Yeah, party on my lawn, whistle as the girls walk by
If the cops roll up (so what?) Pour the cops a cup
cause everybody's here tonight
Call a taxi
Pack the back seat
I wouldn't have it any other way
If you're with me let me hear you say

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (like that) {*2X*}
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Sing it right back, I like it like that)

[New Boyz]
Ohhhh, the homey brought the booze - I like it like that
Cause the girls playin beer pong in the back
We havin fun partyin 'til the break of dawn
Go grab a cup; I dunno what people waitin on
And I'm gonna want a girl that I know I can take home
In the zone, where I think I had I lost my phone
You can tell by lookin in the party's straight crack
And don't worry 'bout girls cause I like it like that

Come back stay here at my grandma's house
And leave your clothes over there yeah that's grandma couch
I be filmin her friends too, yeah I'm back on that
Double D chicks huggin, I got racks on racks
Lie!! I don't wonder if there's a reason for superstar
I'm just tryin to chill with Miley at the hookah bar
You like cartoons? I'll make your heart melt
With this sick tune, play it in the car

[Chorus] - repeat 2X + [Interlude]</pre>
