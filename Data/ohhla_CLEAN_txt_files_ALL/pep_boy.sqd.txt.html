Chorus:

Follow me now cuz I'm a red hot pepper boy
Follow me now cuz I'm a red hot pepper boy
And you know I like the way that you be workin' it
Shake it up, move it round, now twerk with it
Now I wanna see ya back it all in the street
When you wanna hear this song, tell 'em play that beat
And you know I like the way that you be workin' it
Shake it up, move it round, now twerk with it
Now I wanna see ya back it all in the street
When you wanna hear this song, tell 'em play that beat
Go D.J.

[First Verse]
Now we some real high-stepper boys
And a repper boys
Everywhere we go they call us cayenne pepper boys
Yes you better believe
It's P-N-C, the boys that made you wanna score a drop top Z
We be all in
Me and my hounds from Gert-Town shot callin'
Got it sewed up, from Texas to New Orleans
Drama Squad, P-N-C we be never fallin'
We all in
Now everybody in the city say that we be vibin' man
Don't try to test us cuz you get crushed like a can
Everybody wanna do the same thing
Use trigger man
But sometimes things need to change
Like some of these things just don't belong here
Sometimes things just need to change
So I rearranged the game and started the saying
That everybody better just, follow me man
Come on!

Chorus

[Second Verse]
It's extraordinary, not out the ordinary
The way they back that thing in the street just make me tell the D.J.

(Crowd)
Play that beat!

(Girl)
Say Slim they say you actin' funny with your money?

(Kangol Slim)
No sweet thang I ain't actin' strange with my change
Just let me know if you wanna take a ride
Because I got a fifth of (???), and the Drama Squad
And I can give you what you want, give you what you need
Better believe, you wanna leave?

(Girl)
Yes Indeed

(Kangol Slim)
Well when I spin the bin, you just hop on in
We headed to La Quinta Inn, wont'cha bring a friend?
Cuz I got friends too, baby what'cha wanna do?

(Girl)
I could bring my whole crew

(Kangol Slim)
Well that's all on you
And we can have us a gangsta party
Call up Tre, cuz I think things bout to get naughty

Chorus

[Bridge One]
This for my Z riders, in the city what'cha call straight on fire
We bumpin' and you burn rubber with your tires
I mean this strictly for my Z, two, eight riders, that's on fire
This for my Z riders, in the city what'cha call straight on fire
We bumpin' and you burn rubber with your tires
I mean this strictly for my Z, two, eight riders, that's on fire

Chorus

[Bridge Two]
Hey lil' soldiers, where them pepper girls out the Wild Magnolia?
Hey lil' soldiers, where them pepper boys out the Wild Magnolia?
Hey lil' warriors, where them pepper boys out the Wild St. Thomas?
Hey lil' warriors, where them pepper girls out the Wild St. Thomas?
