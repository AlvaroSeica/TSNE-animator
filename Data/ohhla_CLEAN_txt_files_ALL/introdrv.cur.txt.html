[Verse]
Superpotent smoker
Francis Ford Coppola
Godfather Four
Impala on the floor
With my homie Young Hogg
He just flew to the N.O
To check on his homie
And roll up some funky
When he landed, I had a passenger
Type chunky, by the ass
Slim waist, smoking on that gas
With no time to waist, I'm talking two seconds flat
We on this thin stakes skating with the roof in the back
Now Who Dat
I met her, leave it blue-black
She like, "why you do that?"
She like how I do that
Want to know when I'm due back
Can't harness the lightning
Or predict when it's striking
Adjust the lighting
Your boy in here writing
The man I'm supplying
I'm the man, providing
Enlightenment, with what I'm saying
At night I'm in a different car, than what you saw me today in
22 inch blades in every available upgrade
Come at me and be upstaged
I've heard better raps read off page
From my cousin, he in the 4th grade
So I don't know how some of these suckers is getting paid
But that shit don't bump in no trunks around my way, shit junk
Your engineer should've told you that from jump
But he was just tryna get paid, cover the bills for the month
So as long as you pay him for time, drop all the whack rhymes you want

[The Godfather 2]
[Tom] Mike, that's impossible
[Michael] It's not impossible
Nothing's impossible
[Micheal] If anything in this life is certain
if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anyone
[Tom] Are they worth it? I mean you've won...
you want to wipe everybody out [?]
[Micheal] I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom
Just my enemies, that's all

[Drive-In]
We happy to have you with us
we hope that you will enjoy every minutes of your staying
While you relax and stretch, [?] where you'll find something to...
there's ice cold drinks, delicious sandwiches, ice creams, coffee as next...

[The Godfather 1]
[Don Corleone] Your business is a little dangerous
[Sollozzo] If you're worried about security, will guarantee it
[Sonny] Whoa, now, you're telling me
that the Tattaglias guarantee our investment...?
[Don Corleone] I have a sentimental weakness
for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen</pre>
