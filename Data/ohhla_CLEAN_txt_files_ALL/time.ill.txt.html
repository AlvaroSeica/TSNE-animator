It's time to build, it's time to crash
It's time to yield, it's time to last
It's time to feast, it's time to fast
It's time to release, it's time to grab
It's time to open the doors we've closed
It's time to focus the path of our souls
It's time to live so cats can die
It's time to bridge the gaps of our lives
It's time to break, it's time to come together
It's time to shake and be forever
It's time to fall, it's time to stand
It's time to cultivate and better our land
It's time to breath, it's time to breath
It's time to follow, it's time to lead
It's time to walk, it's time to run
It's time to rebel against what we've become

It's never been boxes' time
The tick-tock's watching you unwind this time
It's never been a substitute for time
To bring light to the dark you do, it's lime
Find time to make time for time, now's the time
I shine with hopes that time reflects the shine
I bring sight to the blind to find their way in time
Before time runs out of time
Each line's a moment in time so take a moment in time
And cherish these moments in time
We live in a time where there's limited times
So I'm giving my time
Don't waste your time, I'm going to chase my time slow
Till it's time to go but now's the time, yo
It's time to walk, it's time to run
It's time to rebel against what we've become</pre>
