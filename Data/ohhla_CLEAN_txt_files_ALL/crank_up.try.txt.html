[Chorus]
Crank me up
PT Baby it's bout to get buck
I don't know maybe you never heard of
Caught 'em in the back of the club with black
Hard as a hammer I am Atlanta
As soon as I step on the scene it's lights, camera,
Action, cashin fat ass checks my rolex
Will make you faint
You think I ain't
I hit the bank with 50 grand
Just to spend the night
Na-uh pass me them bills mama I got a flight
? Listen here
Private jet at the do'
A bad ass ho
into the clouds I go

[Pastor Troy]
The underground puttin it down fo 5 years
the blood, the sweat, the motherfuckin tears
I'm livin the life of a young drug lord
I'll blow this heffa up if i get bord
Now ease up shawty
Let the G slide through
And I don't leave without my 32
Tucked in the boots
Tucked in the coat
And when I see chuck
It's gone get tucked in his throat
And Murder She Wrote
But hell I can't read
Stab the ho
Kidnap the bitch seed
Now I'm on the loose
Now I'm on the run
FUCK THAT SHIT
I go and get a bigger gun
So crank me up
If you don't give a damn nigga we don't give a fuck
I bought ya CD
My man y'all suck
Done sucked a cracker dick in the office and came up
Get it
Never wore a vest
Yeah nigga yes
DSGB across my motherfuckin chest nigga
Yes nigga
Picture me bout to bleed
When I done been raised by all the G's
The crooks and killas
Is my motherfuckin niggaz
Jab a pussy
With some motherfuckin scissors
This a motherfuckin crime scene
I'm bussin on the law my nigga by any means
So crank me up
If you a gangsta you need to crank this up
If you don't give a damn nigga we don't give a fuck
Pastor baby bout to crank this up
Crank me up
If you a gangsta you need to crank this up
If you don't give a damn nigga we don't give a fuck
Pastor baby bout to crank this up</pre>
