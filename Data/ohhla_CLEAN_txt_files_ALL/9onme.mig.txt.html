[Verse 1: Quavo]
Ima' cowboy, cause I got that 9 on me
Tony Romo, glahh glahh get away from me
All my goons like linemen, you can't get no sack from me
I took your bitch, I smashed your bitch, left her at the Double Tree
They call me Tony Romo, 9 on me, its solo
Got goons with me that'll hit your ass up, nigga I ain't talking bout no homo
Call up mercy for the mojo,yall niggas ain't getting no dough
Call up the up the plug just for a 3 5, nigga but that whole thing in a relo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Ballout]
I got that 9 on me, run up you die homie
I just hit a lick, so I got it for the dirt cheap
I'm in the trap juugin'ï»¿ all day, sellin' them things
They going for 9 homie, I got my 9 on me
Migos hit me up and said they need 9 homie
I'm like thats crazy cause I'm in the bando now homie
In the kitchen cooking chickens, wrapping up pies homie
And I got my 9 on me, I got my 9 on me

[Chorus]

Glory gang we v.i.p, my homeboys can't wait in lines
