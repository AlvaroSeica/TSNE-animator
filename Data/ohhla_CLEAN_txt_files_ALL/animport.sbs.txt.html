[Crack Stuntman]
Hi kids
BLAAAAH'm Crack Stuntman
I'm the voice of the Gunshaver on Cheat Commandos!
Here with an important rap song about safety and spring break
Bust it!

Well you're a rich kid, living in the suburbs
And there's not a whole lot to do
You stroll into the kitchen and what do you find?
A bunch of knives cold staring at you!
So, kids, don't play wit, too many knives - c'mon, c'mon!
Crack Stuntman gonna, save some lives
Awwwwwww... it's spring break! Girlies running wild
Jet to the beach wearin the freshest styles
Meet a bunch of kids from Alabama!
Beach volleyball slammajamma!
Putt-putt, go carts, bungee-jumpin!
Crack Stuntman keeps the bass pumpin!

Poo-ha-huh-ha-huh
Poo-ha-huh-ha-huh
Poo-ha-huh-ha-huh
Poo-ha-huh-ha-huh
Poo-ha-huh-ha-huh
Poo-ha-huh-ha-huh
Poo-poo-ha-ha-ha-ha-huh-ha-huh

Holla for a dolla! Shout for some clout!
Somebody say holla for a dolla! Let's turn this party out!

Bonfire on the beach and people start to dance
Find a fly girlie for some beach romance
But then a fresh honey comes walkin by
How can a man choose between fresh and fly?
(And believe me, there is a difference!)
Throw your hands in the air for some high-fives
And kids, don't play wit, too many knives

And I am out!
