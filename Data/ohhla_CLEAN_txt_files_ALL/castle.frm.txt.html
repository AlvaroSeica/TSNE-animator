[Need Not Worry]
(It was like), one to two, two.. I was on the avenue to..
get a stamp, and to cop a box of fruit loops
I heard a couple fellas talking bout a duece, duece
but I paid attention to my doggie and his roof roof
A couple mother lovers hanging hoodied down
not a boogie down, residential area but down town
First man, walked in, saw it firsthand
waiting for a signal from the secondary man
Standing on the outside, with a back pack
looking like it could have been mistaken as a black sack
Then it happened, the Gooseman and Maverick
my force of habit had me gettin closer to the action
Heard it loud and clear, "shut up its a robbery"
"Put the money in the bag and we wont have a problem, G"
Sidling silently, I'm watching thru the plate glass
Dudes are getting antsy and they talking bout a brain splat
brain mass splash last, cause they want the fast cash
register man, playing hero without the fat mask..
Dropped the bag...and came up with a 44 MAG...
Laughed, then I heard the muthaphuker blast
Dove quick, both hoodies hit the deck
all they wanted was to get a couple hundred then theyd jet set
And tall paul got up, he's not alot rocked
now he squeeze alot shots, heard the glock (pop pop)
Protagonist ain't having it, he getting arrogant
threw a bottle at the register hope it distracted him
HE WHILING..got hit, he feeling wet soakin..
not knowing it was just a bottle went broken..
sprayin, every bullet hittin Hennesey or VSOP
Now they got to get out of it mostly
thats when the tall one had took a bag of lays
and he threw it, but the man had shot right thru it
It grazed by the other man's hoodie and he knew it
but its not a bite big enough to chew it..(he knew it!!)
they staring at the register the man stand yelling
in a native tongue, slowly just reloading up his one gun
2-1-1 in progress, yo he screaming on the phone
Duo tried to make it to the do' bro
register man approach slow, dont he know though
if you want to wet a fool you gotta get him low pro
so they back door,alley way, wait...
but they split, break, only to avoid and to escape jake
who's not watching from a castle hill and rooftop
both of them be strippin off the hoodies cause they too hot
the tall fella made a left....no sense
but its like he did it on purpose to let his bro jet set
His bro hold breath, he ain't up in the clear yet
fear threat, gotta get away no doubt now..

[8 BAR SONG INTERMISSION]

Thinking about Paul, and if he got knocked
cus he took the second left that led him straight into the cops
he was right...(Why) Paul got knocked 5-10
upstate.....the other one had got away my friend
He stay stable....knowing that paul did him a favor
and now he owe him back because he didnt give his name up
He played it cool, hit a restaurant, smooth
hit the bathroom, walking out the front door....food..
in the hand, blending in the crowd my man
he ain't stupid, he saw his buddy walking his pit..
and said, "shit I know a way to get me out of this mix"
a cop, stopped him.."buddy did you see any of it
in any event, any little statement would do"...
it was like....one to two two..i was on the avenue to
get a stamp, and to cop a box of fruit loops...</pre>
