Song:   Name Me King
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Chorus: Pusha T] + (Game)
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, Your Honor
(Name me king)... Name me king
(I took the crown, infiltrated they fortress)
(Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses)
Name me king... (name me king)

[Game]
Brick by brick I built my fortress
My queen beautiful, Lamborghini is gorgeous
Phantom in the courtyard, 400 horses
Growl made the towers fall, 9-11 Porsches
Number 9 Jordans, pause the Air Forces
Kush clouds, blunts lit by Olympic torches
Gold bars melted, and what returned?
Rolexes, niggaz got Breitlings to burn
Loyalty to earn, royalty to who it may concern
This a Los Angeles King snapback
Sippin 'tr√≥n out the Stanley cup, I don't give a fuck
Drown them in the moat and let the bridge up
My son, my heir in Nike Airs, named my lil' nigga King
Meanin you should bow at his feet, 'fore God intervene
Even when I was in front of triple beams
Stack paper to the ceiling, to the fiends I was king

[Chorus]

[Pusha T]
Raise your glass for the last of the kingpins
The crown in the Maserati grill is minglin
Roleys cross +Oceans+ like Frank out in England
The Gay Pride bezel rainbow like it's spring again
Hah~! Crack rock, crack rock nigga
My SC430 was a drop nigga
Go figure, this nigga play Go Fish
My only pet was fishscale, not a goldfish
My young baby-sitter now my old bitch
Blowjobs cause what I sold made her nose itch
YEUGH! It's the king bein crowned
Watch my predecessor fall like the sun goin down (God!)
It's sunset, this is Sun Tzu (war!)
He paved the way I brought a ton through (wooo!)
Been on his heels like a gum shoe (YEUGH~!)
He took +The Throne+ so I could run through

[Chorus]

[Game]
Rose petals at my feet when I'm steppin out the Rolls
The royal penis is clean, Versace belt gold
Sweatin like a slave where them pies get sold
Accompanied by fourteen karats stole
Adjust the temperature, let the +Heat+ rise up
Like Jesus Shuttlesworth in that glass jar
Blue flame glowin like a Avatar
Five more minutes says the silent gold hand goin 'round on my Audemar
Angels in the wing, ass naked do your thing
Show me what that baking soda bring, do it for your king
Every time I look up, they cook up
I be the Master of them P's, +I Got the Hook Up+
From New Orleans to Virginia
I told her stuff them pies in her Virginia
Never been caught, can't be bought, she's a winner
Fly 'em south for the winter, make it back home for dinner
