Man
I'm forcin it that uh

And hey

Xscape:
he's the B-O you know that he's off the glass
BW: yes i've been this way ever since I was a baby
O-H-I-O bringin down the stash
BW: for all my dogs all the kids all my ladies

Bow Wow:
It's the B-O you know that I'm off the glass
reprasentin so so we maki that cash
It's a little pup now everybody wanna be hustlas
Earned my stripes from the platinum MIC
Now what's up 1-2-3 times and still countin
How many time do I keep ya bouncin
Wait let me think ever since My interlude 
not a day goes by that you won't see me on the tube
Big thangs for a little big man
Still rock the mickey but I had to go and cop that big dog chain
Big dog earings
Ima do my thang
So when you see me on the streets
You see that big dog bling
When I crossed out yo' bak 
It's gotta be up in it
If the ride ain't tinted
If I forget to mention
It's all about the benjamins Somebody betta tell em

(Chours)
Xscape:
