Song:   Hold On (To Your Lunch)
Typed by: www.suddendeath.org

Hold on to your lunch 'cause the Sudden Death bunch
Is buggin' in my basement comin' up with a crunch
That settles in your stomach runs it all around
Till it spews out your mouth then spills on the ground
Can't think of anything creative so we're wastin' our time
Comin' up with a rediculous rhyme
We're gonna make you neasous, that's the way we run our biz
It's comin' up my throat, here it comes...</pre>
