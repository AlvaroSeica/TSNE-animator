You cut me Slimm, and I'll cut you
You cut me Slimm, and I'll cut you

[Slimm]
New game, true flame, spit, spark and sizzle
Stepped up approached clam, spoke start to chisel
Hit her with the punch line guess she caught the riddle
Cause I'm off to the Lake House to tickle her middle
I gotta fun pack, a hundred sack, look like skittle
Pop two, let's screw now she's gobbling vittles
Whip cream, cherries, nuts, and a pickle, shit
Me I'm burning one why she blowing the fiddle
That's point game, point blank range wit yo' bitch
Let my nuts hang then I point aim for yo' shit
Pop lip then I point thangs and pull quick
Out the back door, Mr. Chop Sticks wit yo' bitch

[Hook]
You cut me Slimm, and I'll cut you
You cut me girl, and I'll cut you
You cut me Slimm, and I'll cut you
You cut me girl, and I'll cut you

[Slimm]
Bill Changer wit the quick hands handling thangs
Mr. Slick Talk to separate the cut from the tame
Girl, look your eye just to get your brain
She bit, hook, line, and sinker I don't spit it the same
They choose, I peek that's how plenty get slain
You snooze I creep behind the tint grippin grain
One rule, that's freak now she off the chain
Whirlpool no sleep, girl you can't hang
It's like, chicks, flicks and a six
Of some purple drank and purple dank
It's like tits, licks now we in the mix trying to have fun
I got one big cup and two big blunts and the party's just begun
I said roll it up, (uh-huh)
I said pour it up!

[Hook]
You cut me Slimm, and I'll cut you
You cut me Slimm, and I'll cut you
You cut me girl, and I'll cut you
 
[Slimm]
Back at the cut spot or should I say chop shop
Rolling some top crop and working on the top notch
Heard that she was table grade
Don't know but she looking stable made
Gotta buddy wit her working both sides of the street
And they trying to work out at the Calhoun suites
Call, Cool fall through cut in progress
And you bring you cause these two loving my sex
Still of the drank leaning, (uh-huh)
Still got these hoes steamin, (uh-huh)
It's like, chicks, flicks and a six
Of some purple drank and purple dank
It's like tits, licks now we in the mix trying to have fun
I got one big cup and two big blunts and the party's just begun
I said roll it up, (uh-huh)
I said pour it up!

[Hook]
You cut me Slimm, and I'll cut you
You cut me girl, and I'll cut you
You cut me Slimm, and I'll cut you
You cut me girl, and I'll cut you
Chicks, flicks and a six
Of some purple drank and purple dank
It's like tits, licks now we in the mix trying to have fun
I got one big cup and two big blunts and the party's just begun
I said roll it up, (uh-huh)
I said pour it up!

[Hook]
You cut me Slimm, and I'll cut you
You cut me girl, and I'll cut you
You cut me Slimm, and I'll cut you
You cut me girl, and I'll cut you</pre>
