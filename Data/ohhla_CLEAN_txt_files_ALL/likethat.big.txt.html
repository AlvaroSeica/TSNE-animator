[Intro]
Yeah! Bill Biggz in the building
And we still rebuilding
I'm about to get loose on this track
Ya diiiiig? Le'GO!

[Bill Biggz]
I'm just the chip of the ol' block, serious
I bleed life unto a rhyme, period
You just a cat that I killed, curious
"Boyz n the Hood", my style's +Furious+
Technique never weak, speak in the monotone
When you rhyme, it sounds like it's through a telephone
It wouldn't matter to me if you was dead and gone
It's like Biggie said, nigga, you was +Dead Wrong+
Just the kind of person that I wanna put my hands on
Got no foundation, nothing to stand on
Kick niggaz like Bruce Lee, just to get my brand on
Please, please just listen to my demo
Check the EP, got so many bars, you gon' need a M.D.
He's just alright and I use that loosely
That nigga so dope, oh yeah who me? (Me?)
Autotune ain't talent man, you can't fool me
It's gon' take more than shots for you to shoot me
Pack a punch like Pacquiao, proof's in the P 
And I done about everything from A to Z

[Chorus]
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all 
It's like that-a-tha-that, a-like that y'all 
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all 
It's like that-a-tha-that, a-like that y'all 

[Bill Biggz]
I was born in the 70s', raised in the 80s'
Raised hell in the 90s', now shit is crazy
You couldn't pay me to fuck with these rappers
I'ma start givin Grammys, to all of these actors
Make 'em face all they fear, Bill Biggz is the factor 
I ain't talkin 'botu applause, when I say you get clapped up
When I spit, you been hit by a Mack truck
Let my team hear it, and they all said that sucks
Reprogram cause your program jammin
Get it out to the masters, I'm shipping and handling
Everyday I'm hsutlin, everyday I'm scramblin
Everyday I'm writing so these suckas, dismantle 'em
You ain't got a choice, deal with the chosen one
I don't need the chips just to show that I'm holdin 'em
Keep tellin 'em, now I'm tired of showin 'em
Nigga, FUCK that nigga, nigga nice knowin 'em~!

[Chorus]
