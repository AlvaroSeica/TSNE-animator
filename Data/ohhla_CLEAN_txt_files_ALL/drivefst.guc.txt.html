[Intro]
Yeah, Gucci {*4X*}
Yeah, Gucci {*4X*} (So Icy, So Icy)
Zaytoven baby

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I drive real fast baby I don't drive slow
I don't drive slow, I don't drive slow
Drop the top on that thang just to let ya hair blow
Let ya hair blow, let ya hair blow

[Gucci Mane]
I drive a sports car bitch, put them Bapes to the gas
If you scared go to church cause I'm fin' ta drive fast
Throwing cash out the brains of a '74 Oldsmo'
There no mojo, he need to get some mo' dough
Cornerstore, Amoco, bottle Crist' {?} Flat Shoal
Niggaz want that wola, shawty meet right by Grecian Road
East side up, put them E's in the air
If you smoking bubba kush, put them trees in the air
I'm smoking on that kush so it's stankin up my car
They call me "twinkle twinkle" cause they know that I'm a star
I told her come here then I didn't say shit
Cause my ice talk for me, I don't need no broke bitch

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Verse two, Gucci fish shoes, and a purse too
Stealer of yo' chain, turn your watch to Starburst too
Put them Lemonheads in yo' ears
Put them Fruity Pebbles on yo' fingers, now you envied by yo' peers
And I'ma get yo' ass in shape
All that Gucci Louis Chong got yo' ass loosin weight (leanin)
Gucci Mane got you straight, huh?
You know he got that cake, gave it to her first date
I'ma ride down the block like a damn X pill
Standin tall on them sixes like some damn high heels
I'ma roll down the block like a damn X pill
Standin tall on them sixes like some damn high heels

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Yeah a Rose, red Mikey's wit Bapes
On some pharaohe shit, bitches feedin niggaz grapes
I'ma buy some hot wings, but I could buy steak
But I'm good with a trout, bitch a model too fake
Zaytoven on the beat so you know they gon' hate
Got that Tony Tiger kush, man that shit smoke great
Got that water bumpin talented, I think I can do it
Drop me and your body filled with them other fluid
Trapper slash rapper but a full time G
Smokin purp' with my boys, 'bout two or three P's
I'm a trapper slash rapper but a full time G
Smokin purp' with my boys, 'bout two or three P's

[Chorus]</pre>
