[Justin Timberlake]
Hey little mama, ain't gotta ask me if I want to
Just tell me, can I get a light? Roll you up and let it run through my veins
Cause I can always see the farthest stars when I'm on you
I don't wanna ever come down off this cloud of lovin' you

[Chorus]
Now you got me hopped upon that pusher love - so high I'm on the ceiling baby
You're my drug - so gon' and be my dealer baby
Roll me up - cause all I want is you, baby
(One more time) Pusher love - so high I'm on the ceiling baby
Be my drug - so gon' and be my dealer baby
Hook me up - cause all I want is you, baby, yeah, yeah

[Interlude]
You're my little pusher love girl (ain't ya? Ooh, ooh, yeah)
Just my little pusher love girl...

[Justin Timberlake]
Now hey little mama, I love this high we're on too
And I know that your supply, won't run out anytime soon
You gave me a taste, now I know that there's no getting off you
I don't wanna ever come down off this cloud of lovin' you

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
You're my little pusher love girl (ain't you? Ooh, ooh - yes, you are)
Just my little pusher love girl - I want you

[Justin Timberlake]
Since you came around, I've been living a different life
And I don't wanna come down from this love I got on high
People call me a user, but I want you to go on and use me too
Nothing else will do, all I want is you, baby
I know, baby, you know who you are

[Chorus] - 2X

[Interlude]
You're my little pusher love girl (so sweet - yes, you are)
Just my little pusher love girl (ain't you? Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
She's my little pusher love girl...

[Justin Timberlake]
Yeah, yeah, oh yes, yeah..
Sing, pusher love {*echoes*}
I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love (c'mon)
Now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
I'm hopped upon it - pusher love {*echoes*}
And now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love - break it down
My heroine, my cocaine
My plum wine, my MDMA
I'm hopped upon it, it won't go away
And I can't wait 'til I get home to get you in my veins
Pusher love - I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
I'm hopped upon it and now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
Say, pusher love - I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
I'm hopped upon it; and now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
Uh, my nicotine, my blue dream
My hydroponic, candy jelly bean
Can't you fix me up? I'm your number one fiend
Be my little pill and just creep into my bloodstream
Blood shot eyes, I'm hopped upon it
You ain't gotta think twice, just hop upon it
There's a million names for your kind of chronic
That's pusher love, that's what I call it
Pusher love - I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
Mm, I'm hopped upon it; now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
Let me hear you say pusher love, now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
I'm hopped upon it, yeah; and now I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love
Pusher love... {*3X*}</pre>
