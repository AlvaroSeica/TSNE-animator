[Pusha T]
Yo wattup ma'
I got a pocket full of stinky's lets go spin these right quick

[Girl]
Whats that?

[Chorus - Pusha T]
All my fly bitches like (dirty money, dirty money)
All my stripper bitches like (dirty money, dirty money)
All my college hoes like (dirty money, dirty money)
Dont it spend so right? (dirty money, dirty money)
Now lets go shopping, lets go chill
Lets go buy them new Louis Vuitton heels
Ass of La Perla, ears full of pearls
Damn dirty money know how to treat the girls

[Verse - Pusha T]
Give a little - take a little, ma check the dealy
Most niggaz is will-not's, your dealing with a willy
3-D faces on them criffs new billi's
Got benji lookin all googley-eyed and silly
The glitter chill got ya mind seein milli-mill's
Im 7 figga, the bigger you thought the little real
See I don't blame ya, cashmere's what you feel
Picturing the fortune, you just tryna spin the wheel
Brain like Terry, face like Eva
I ain't forgettin them other Housewive's neither
Two-seaters, back in the trunk, 2 feevas
We stayin up till 2 a.m.to watch cheaters
As long as I'm nice with the flame and the flass
I don't mind keepin you up on them must-have's
Pito pumps, Gucci slouch bags
Now tell me, is that dirty money really that bad?

[Chorus - Pusha T]
All my fly bitches like (dirty money, dirty money)
All my stripper bitches like (dirty money, dirty money)
All my college hoes like (dirty money, dirty money)
Dont it spend so right? (dirty money, dirty money)
Now lets go shopping, lets go chill
Lets go buy them new Louis Vuitton heels
Ass of La Perla, ears full of pearls
Damn dirty money know how to treat the girls

[Verse - Malice]
We could trip tuiton, you could be the vixen
You could front for ya girlfriend's, I ain't trippin'
You done got you a rapper, I see ya vision
And one of the best too, thats ambition
You could tell me bout ya day, I pretend I listen
And you ain't gotta love me, just be convincin'
I don't ask much, some ashes on the cuff
And that silver bullet, automatic or the clutch
Nah mama hush, you ain't even gotta speak
Jus put it on ya charge, check makes ya feet
Compliment of me, take the bitter with the sweet
And we can get this money like its falling outta tree
Come spend a dolla, yea, bathe in it, walla
17-5 for the low, tell 'em "Holla"
Love you in the Scoda, Jimmy Choo, Prada
Snow White ya life, hows that for starters?

[Chorus - Pusha T]
All my fly bitches like (dirty money, dirty money)
All my stripper bitches like (dirty money, dirty money)
All my college hoes like (dirty money, dirty money)
Dont it spend so right? (dirty money, dirty money)
Now lets go shopping, lets go chill
Lets go buy them new Louis Vuitton heels
Ass of La Perla, ears full of pearls
Damn dirty money know how to treat the girls

[Verse]

[Pusha T]
To my fly ghetto bitches with there hair-shop-talk
Braggin to there hair-dresser bout that shit he bought
To my South Beach bitches with that sassy walk
Who ain't tryna hear nuttin if you don't ride Porsche
To my get-money niggaz gettin paper fa' sho
Drinkin Grand's up in Loui' for the love of the sport
I tell ya, get money money, take money money, uh
Dope money money is great money money, what?

[Malice]
Before I'ma bicker with ya, ma, I'ma switch ya
I fly 'em in quick, I fly 'em out even quicker
By no means, am I in love with a stripper
You understand that then you fit in the glass slipper
Travelin Broads, sittin in G-4's
Change in the weather, when it rains, it pours
And the crib is ajoined with French doors
You rock with ya boy then anything is yours

[Chorus - Pusha T]
All my fly bitches like (dirty money, dirty money)
All my stripper bitches like (dirty money, dirty money)
All my college hoes like (dirty money, dirty money)
Dont it spend so right? (dirty money, dirty money)
Now lets go shopping, lets go chill
Lets go buy them new Louis Vuitton heels
Ass of La Perla, ears full of pearls
Damn dirty money know how to treat the girls </pre>
