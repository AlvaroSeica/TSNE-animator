[Chorus 2x: Bizzy &amp; Krayzie Bone]
god bless these niggaz like ha'chu (they wanna die, they wanna die)
cuz I'll leave a nigga dead if I have to (this ain't a game)
praying to the lord tell him touch you (they wanna die, they wanna die)
cuz I'll leave your ass dead nigga fuck you (nigga this ain't a game)

[Lil' Eazy-E]
Little Eazy, young G in the C-P-T
west coast to the casket drop, (in south) block and I got that key
straight gangster I'm just trying to see
who the fuck these hoes trying to be
in the hood it's understood don't fuck around with Eazy-E
you cross him, it's mayhem
you owe him, just pay him
anything else you asking for a nigga untimly passin
but it's all to the good in hood brings the wood like we should
all night long on this Compton shit with Bone

[Chorus: Layzie Bone]
ain't no body taking mine, and no it's not a game
I'm a leave a nigga dead in the streets, {streets}
so let the word get around, I'm a lay a nigga down
if he ever think he better than me
see they can never compete
a heat seeker, infa red creeper, real blood leaker
coming through your speaker
listen up close cause it's about to get deeper
about 6 feet I gotta sleeper with the reaper
9 milimeter go bang bang ba da da dang ba da da dar dang
watch a little nigga do his thang, thang
he do his thang, you know I do my thang
I'm a rep for the god father
gangster music please beleive me
Eric Wright's still bombing on 'em deuce double o six with the seeds of eazy

[Chorus]

[Bizzy]
one of the reasons we needed"a"me a moment up in silence
in the middle of it"it'll"be a bopwit
bizzy Bone get a gun for the chrome we do pop it
and they never can sink the ship
and the thuggish ruggish yes you know but we don't ride in
the one an the people they wanna tell me
but they come in they desiring
tell em my thugs desiring I still cant remember the front side in
shoulda remember day that we was thriving vibing
from pullin together we'll never split up or get up and get on
you know that im crying forever my name is bryan
little bizzy in the kizzy he up in the house
call it whatever you want to call it if I'm crawlin
It's heavenz movie you know that I'm out to say wow
gotta get that money ain't a damn thing funny
you ever been hungry they know im comming
wrap up a body an cover with lenil an excuse me
you know you live fully in sin im a gentlemen
I don't have anytime for us to play
hotter back furgin virgin tell em that"a"we splurgin splurgin

you will never be little to me when you need me ill be there in person wow

[Chorus]

[Wish]
first off im a let em know
bone thugs little e thug it coast to coast
I ain't gone lie nigga get raw you can feel that fire better go on boy
in the hood yes everday cause I still got the hood in me this in me
if your in position better get it better get it complete it
take that laid back but im still the top dog
when things go down from cleveland to compton
you need me just holla
thugs in big trucks we real wont doubt ready for problems
every single day chasing money man
it don't seem I can think about another thing

[Krayzie Bone]
It's another coming at ya, so you better pray
It's mr sawed off just call me leatherface, hit a brain
drama if they really wanna it
but I don't think they really want it
if they knew just what I do to my opponent
gonna be another muder moment
ruff &amp; rugged thuggish, ruggish, keep it ole soul gully
really I'm knowing they ain't ready to see us put in down with little eazy e Bone thugs n harmony
always ready to get down
for what ever when ever you wanna go acouple rounds, c'mon
so anybody wanting beef, run up
we got it hot off the grill, sawd off the real
raised on these streets man
so the trill, gonna recognise trill
look watever deal, the case
the situations none of ya'll can never see kray
we got em all trying 2 listen up &amp; observe the words hitting replay
like man what did he say

[Chorus]

[Lil' Eazy-E with Krayzie Bone]
it'll be one less nigga, fucking around with my figures
yo ass won't get no bigger
I'm so fast when I pull that trigger, don't test me
e.s.c. for me new generation compton g
in the hood it's understood, don't fuck around with eazy e
(gotta get that paper, paper)
(gotta get that money man)
gotta have these hoes on point
when I sit back and smoke this joint
(gotta make that money man)
(gotta get that paper, paper)
do you nigga I cant hate ya
keep it gangster thats my nature

[Chorus]</pre>
