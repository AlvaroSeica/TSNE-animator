(Pimp C)
Yeahh, comin' down
Dedicated to them boys ridin' slab

(Hook)
I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood
I fli-, I flip

(Verse 1, Pimp C)
I flip down the Ave., you know I'm lookin' tight
These jealous niggas lookin' at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine, nigga never do that
Who say he goin' through a thang, when y'all ain't never lied
I gotta baby, but his mama act like he ain't mine
Wicked women, usin' children to live on
Wanna hurt and try to hate, 'cause she know the thrill is gone
Say man, I stopped smokin' wit' haters back in ninety-four
But niggas thinkin' that a Sweet gon' get him through my door
And niggas talk a lotta shit, in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye-to-eye when he in my face
Now nigga listen to my beats, and see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, ain't all what it look like
So I keep swangin', out here clangin' tryina live my life

(Hook)
I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood
I fli-, I flips down the Ave.

(Verse 2, Bun B)
I see these niggas and days, go and come
And for me, just to wake, I know I'm blessed
I grab my 'ses and split my Swisher wit' my thumb
Some of my Sweets be tight, now some of my Sweets be fucked up!
But alla' my Sweets gon' blow, so killa' smoke get sucked up!
I looked up today, and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say, tomorrow they won't be blastin' this-a-way
I'm puffin' spliff's of hay, still upset about the drama here
At this time of year, I'm wipin' away my dead homies mama tears (Shit)
But naturally, them fuckin' laws was always after me
So I have to be, in that manor on that five-oh-three
I'm livin' dastardly, must be all about survival 'g
These niggas passin' me, streets just keep on gettin' live wit' me
They said there has to be another way, but I ain't feelin' that
They tried to steal a Lac, and my wig, they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains, it's all about the 'cain
"Swang and Bang", peace to ESG and all the victims of the game, mang

(Hook)
I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood
I fli-, I flips down the Ave.

(Verse 3, Pimp C)
Flippin' through the Ave, tryina see some good
But everythang is still the same, in my neighborhood
Niggas frown when you up, and smile when you down
And when you change for the better, shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hatin' and the wicked ways
We all lost children, praisin' paper, smokin' our life away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me, but all we do now is fuck and fight
My conscience fuck wit' me so much that I can't eat or sleep
The other side of sellin' dope, and out there runnin' the streets
And even though I'm gainin' street fame, comin' from this rap game
Lustful thinkin' and compulsive drinkin' is a normal thang
Some get erased and mis-placed, tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to they papes by smokin' whit-lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gon' change the hood
I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the trunk to make me feel good

(Hook)
I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood
(Pimp C: I'm smokin' skunk and poppin' the trunk to make me feel good)

I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I fli-, I flips down the Ave.
Know I'm lookin' good
I'm bangin' "Screw", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood
