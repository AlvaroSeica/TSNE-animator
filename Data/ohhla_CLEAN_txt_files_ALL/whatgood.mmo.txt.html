Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 4X: Trigg-nomm]
What's really good? Baby girl, what's really good?
Baby, tell me what's really good?

[Itchy Fingas Sha]
Look ma, what's really good, is you sliding with us?
VIP in the back of the Denali truck
Smoke a little of that Cali skunk, I ain't hardly drunk
Truck shaking, I ain't hitting no bumps
Bitch naked and she getting it crunk
She like 'daddy, you can take it any way that you want, back or front'
Ma, I like head mode, that's the best mode
She put it in her mouth, and I let it explode
Whoa, I felt guilty bout letting it go
But a hoe is just a hoe and she gon' do what she know
Plus it's late like four in the morn', and I ain't been home
Wifey probably sitting in a brand new thong
Heated, she know she need it, either love it or leave it
The thug or the reefer, anything she needed, I give her
Platinum Visas, Gucci all the way down to her sneakers
Monster diva, got to stop breating or leave her, yeah

[Hook: Trigg-nomm]
I, need to know what's, really good
What's really good, what's really good

[Chorus 2X]

[Chorus 2X]

[Trigg-nomm]
Came to the quarter to eight, at a quarter to eight
Eat up, stuck leaning like a quarter to eight
In the cut, stuff caught a ki, or the three eight
A nigga shady over mashed potatoes and gravy
So me and my lady rock twin bulletproof AV's
Driving Miss Daisy, in the bulletproof Mercedes
Wrist fizzy, hoe dizzy, get mesmerized
Iced collar, bitch holla, got bezzledized
Entrepeneur screwer, I saw it right through her
Sipping that Hypnotiq, while she cuddle the Kaluha
My shorty thought I knew her, watch me persue her
Came over toasting, said, let's boast to her
So now I'm like ma, is you down for twa'
Down to spar, multiple manage' massage
Jumped back in the car, to the Ramada
What's really good, is they scream holla and swallow

[Hook]

[Chorus 2X]

[Pearl Handles]
And you can get it if you wanna, girl, straight up, dead in yo gut
Where you want it, I put it on you, give it to you rough
Backshot positions, giving you what you missing
I, run like an engine when you start my ignition
Listen, I'm a black bilingual speaking brother
Give you what you need, make you forget about the others
I'm that undercover, dark lover, booty assassin
Pussy stretching like elastic, when I'm smashing
Hit 'em where you fit 'em, girl, if I dipping in you
I'mma fit it to your lungs, til your lips turn blue
What you wanna do, long stroking, put you in motion
Got that potion, rub it on your face like lotion
She pissy off the Henny, I'm twizzy from the chronic, it's ill
We both naked in the back of her Bonneville
You know I keep her hood, tell me what's really good
Thuggin like I should, ma, tell me what's really good
