[Verse One: Fat Joe]
In coke we trust, damn right got Tony's Touch
The world is mine, gettin them Milwaukee Bucks
No Jennings, no gods we all sinnin
Run a m√©nage, preferably with D.R. women
In the coupe gettin top yeah we all skimmin
Best that ever done it talkin Lee or  Simmons
Want to be deceased, before it gets too real
Nah nigga this is Palestine, Israel
Got tweakers that don't sit still
Let 'em go watch your niggas get they shit peeled
Goin green I ain't tuckin no windmills
Rock steady got organic e pills

[Chorus: Sadat X]
50 mc's with my man Tony Touch
Got my lil' body with me she pop herself with the clutch
50 mc's with my man Tony Touch
Got my lil' body with me she pop herself with the clutch

[Verse Two: KRS-One]
Yo, sorry for the delay, you still my favorite DJ
I'm bumpin Tony Touch while I crush the wheel on the freeway
Ain't never see meh, I go from CA out in GA
I'm underground like the miners used to be in Chile
I ressurrect in three days in them clubs with them DJs'
Givin them that classic dee-dee-dee-DEE-dah-dee-dee-day
Honorary doctorate degrees, Emmys' and BAs'
This is not your average MCs', rappers I filet
Pull they spine out when they pull they rhyme out with no delay
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, it's that culture lyric that he say
Legendary performer, promoters always repay
I rock in cots, stucks, gangstas the judge and the D.A.
We stay, connected to the calling like a three-way
Preserve hip-hop, do not put your soul up on eBay
So we say, Knowledge Reigns Supreme is the best way
K-R-S or ca-erre-ese

[Chorus: Sadat X]
50 mc's with my man Tony Touch
Got my lil' body with me she pop herself with the clutch

[Verse Three: Sadat X]
Hey baby! Your hips are still big
She my ride or die nigga you know she down with the kid
Swear I got no problems with the nails and wigs
On church on sunday, hold the thing on monday
Will I wife her with the ring yeah my nigga one day
I'm the all star for e'ry month you know that I am!
We can keep it legal word to credit card scams
That's why I love her e'ryday 'cause she let the God ram
Film her with the mini cam nah not me
Like KRS-One say the pussy nah free!</pre>
