[Werd]
All right this song is all about a girl
A girl called Fame
Disciple Beats
The fame this whole famous thing
Aint that about a bitch

[Sample]
Take a look at my girlfriend
Shes the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
We never seem to get along [x2]

[Werd]
I write with my heart in the text a love letter
To my dream girl no one could be better
She plays hard to get and I've never really met her
I might be single now but a single al get her
And I can feel it now
Right down in my soul mate
I write down my feelings feel she is my soul mate
My soul fate get to the top burn like Sulphate
Love at first mic made my young heart pulsate
A guy called Werd and a girl called fame
But ad still be sound if Deeko fucked her the same
I'm not upset cause I think we should get her
I'm upset cause you got her
And she could do better
Av hardly met her
But I know for a fact
That we gone be together no one pull us apart
No ones ruling my heart no ones stopping my goal
Yeah fames a bitch
I'm just wanting my hole

I'm looking at this bird and I'm thinking I want her
Cause I know my life would be better if only I had her
I know opportunities come and some of them go
But if I cant fuck this one I will fucking explode
I got a passion for the rapping
I'm sure some of you know
And you can witness it first hand if you come to the show
Every line a put in a rhyme is getting m closer
Stick my hands out when I'm rapping so I reach and I hold her
I hope to God my destination is to finally meet her
Not when I'm gone but when I'm alive
And able to see her
Iv been waiting to greet her
Other wanting her quicker
Some will sell their respect to get fifth teen minutes with her
Cause shes special when you got her dont want to leave her
She'll drive you over the edge suicide believe me
She will suck the life from you
Like the moment was blown
Cause it seems shes easy to get
But hard to control come on

I want this lassie so I made her a mixtape
This is how I feel with music
Pure shit mate
I want to switch fate
I'll flip out like switch blades
I want to cut a deal I dont mean like snitches
I never hit a lassie but al give you a hit
Give constant hits maybe baby am sick
Fuck the dick
I'm a show you my tong skills
Want the cashier like some one that runs tills
And theres still cunts saying they fuck you when they dont
These lying cunts tried to fuck you but you wont
Then you go and act like so serious
But they couldnt fuck with you like period
Couldnt get her wet dicks spit all day
Trying to cum up inside
But flop there all gay
Its class phore play in the bedroom like
Where there I wrap on the jonney or rap on the mic
