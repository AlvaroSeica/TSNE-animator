Album:  Inevitable
Song:   Grab a Cloud
Typed by: @Daneo10

CHORUS (Dan-e-o) 
Yeah, put your hands to the sky
Grab a cloud, hold it out, hold it high
We live our dreams and don't ever let 'em die
Now hold on for the ride of your life, my nigga...   

VERSE ONE 
(Dan-e-o)
I reached out to grab a cloud and hit my hand on a star
I want it all with no strings attached like a damaged guitar
Getting higher than if I fired up the cannabis hard
Planned and persistent, I got business to handle with God
 
(Slick) 
Gettin' my bird's eye on,
The cotton in the sky is the apple of my eye like your first iphone,
Tryna possess the power to divert cyclones,
Cuz you ain't making it rain in my own time zone

(Conwell)
These titans are tightly knit, and the title is tightly kept
In our tribe from a trifling, we triumph so try again
Tycoons my typhoon will trample on Tiny Tim
Your trapped in my tornado, erupt like a volcano

(Dan-e-o) 
Straight up, my tall faith goes right ahead, never left behind
See what I'm saying? Or is destiny deaf and blind?
I'm blessed, I shine refusin' to flunk the test of time
Steady pressed to find a path to keep my stars best aligned

(Slick)
Destined to shine at the darkest hour with Tony Stark power
The iron fist, feared like the leviathan,
Aspiring to retire one of the higher end
Upper echelon rappers you is admiring

CHORUS (Dan-e-o) 
Yeah, put your hands to the sky
Grab a cloud, hold it out, hold it high
We live our dreams and don't ever let 'em die
Now hold on for the ride of your life, my nigga...   

VERSE TWO
(Conwell) 
They say the sky's the limit, I learned a little bit                                
In the middle of liberty city, to lay 'em lyrically 
out Little league literally don't do diddle scribbling                           
that there air to rain, here's how thunder and lightning sound

(Dan-e-o) 
There's no fright in me now, fueled with passion that helps me skyrocket
Actually, it's quite shockin' like empty eye sockets
Define logic like my assignment's a science project
If you don't mind, watch it, the flyest topic like a comet

(Slick)
The pressure popping my ears but I ain't dropping
Riding a magic carpet, I dream of genie she's my first target
Thinking of space like Steve Hawking I'm barking in a dog fight
And tree sparking makes this a long flight

(Conwell) 
Filled up to reach the height. A hijacker can take a hike
When A hired-gun, takes a mic, or  a high-road, and spears your hide
Now I'm all high and mighty, hierarchy is on your hiney
Y'all ready you mis-fits, walk a mile in the mist of mischief

(Dan-e-o) 
Blink and  you'll miss this sensational display of crispness
Dummies get dismissed, bonafide bahdman business
Leavin' rappers sadder than if they had a giftless Christmas
Or hearin' they mistress has Syphilis-induced blisters!

CHORUS (Dan-e-o)
Yeah, put your hands to the sky
Grab a cloud, hold it out, hold it high
We live our dreams and don't ever let 'em die
Now hold on for the ride of your life, my nigga...   

VERSE THREE

(Slick)
Creating heaven but I angel wing it
I hate your lyrics and your gimic how is you major with it
A fatal finish in my writtens tell em I came to win within
A split second in after mic checking in

(Conwell) 
My knowledge ain't for a novice
My niggas nodding, they noggins 
Agreed upon that your naus-e-ating, don't make me nauseous
I'm daring these niggas not to, flare me like nigga nostrils
My thoughts are a little cloudy, we'll show you why we're above view

(three man back and forth) 
You suck like a slut do / we rock parties you can't come through
Trojans of rap /  strapped as we approach and attack
Encroaching your territory / a battle story / that ends with your fall
All are declining / tarnish your silver lining

CHORUS (Dan-e-o)
Yeah, put your hands to the sky
Grab a cloud, hold it out, hold it high
We live our dreams and don't ever let 'em die
Now hold on for the ride of your life, my nigga...</pre>
