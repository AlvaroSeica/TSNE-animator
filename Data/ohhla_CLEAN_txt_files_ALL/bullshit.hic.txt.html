[ VERSE 1: Hi-C ]
Bullshit, that's the title of this shit
And when you hear bullshit, you say that shit hit
Now quit, don't try to fuck with this
I just drunk some gin, I gotta take a piss
Mmh... Ahh... what a relief
All up in a girl I just released my beef
I keep huffin and puffin until I come
Yo bitch, give up the pussy and don't play (dumb)
For your body you know I been cravin
The last couple of weeks my lunch money I been savin
To get your ass in a motel
My dick is steady poundin and you're the scale
So weigh me, wait, I'm about to strip
Take off them clothes, so I can rip
That coochie, I know you wanna give it to me
But hey hoe, don't try and do me
I'm cool and patiently I been waitin
Skanless stuck-up bitches, them's the ones I be hatin
And when it's time to get a dick-pack
They always come with that shitty act
(I'm sorry Hi-C, we can't go out tonight)
Fuck that shit, y'all make a nigga wanna fight
So hey what's up, it's gon' be like that?
I ain't gon' ask you no more, I'm about to jack
Now take off your clothes and lay down flat
Cause that big fat pussy I got to crack
She took off her jeans, body lookin real pretty
I made a mistake when I asked to see the titties
She ripped off her bra, didn't have no fear
That shit was slappin, clappin, flappin like elephant ears
I said "Damn" they big as fuck
A little bit too big for Hi-C to suck
So I thought for a minute without makin a sound
It'd take at least ten minutes for me to wrestle 'em down
Threw back on her bra, tied it up in a knot
Slapped her on the padlock and said, "Now let me see your cock"
She said, "Ah-a, stop boy, that's enough, I quit"
Now how would you feel if I just slapped you, bitch?
I'm hittin harder than a bullet, my rhymes don't quit
I'm Hi-C, hoe, so stop poppin that bullshit

(Come on y'all, say it
Bullshit)
Yeah
(Yeah
Bullshit)
Y'all niggaz thought I was sellin out
(Louder
Bullshit
Everybody
Say it
Bullshit
Yeah
Bullshit)
Keep slingin that funky shit
(Bullshit)
How we do
(Bulllshit
Yeah)

[ VERSE 2: Hi-C ]
The bullshti I write is the ultimate
Not the counterfeit, but the legit shit
Now trip, I'm the writer of this script
It'll make ya hop because it's so damn hip
Bullshit is like a thief, it'll run from your ass
It's sort of like diarrhea, just splishedy-splash
Bullshit is bad, it'll rough you up
Like a bitch with the drips it'll fuck you up
But then again it's tasty like beef
Like a bitch suckin your dick without no teeth
Feel good, now don't you want that feelin?
Big bullshit, that's the stuff that I'm dealin
When I'm bullshittin, here's what I do
Roll up a fat joint, grab a 40 or two
Crack open a bottle and get to down that shit
I turn on the TV, watch some nasty flicks
Now when you bullshit you're not similar to Crawf
You're locked up in the bathroom jackin off
With a goddamn nasty book inside your hand
That bullshit is for the average man
The men I know, hey, they like to fuck
Like to lick on some titties or get they dick sucked
That type of shit goes on in life
Where you bust a couple fo kids go get you a wife
I'm the hip-hop hazard Hi-C
And I will never quit, that's just the itsy-bit
Of the bullshit

Yeah
You know how I'm doin it
Y'all niggaz can't fade this
Haha
Steady rollin with the punches
You know what I'm sayin?

(Oh Hi-C, oh, your music be bumpin, boy
You got it going on
I know you're makin money now
With your cute self
Ahm, just let me know what you want me to do for you?)

[ VERSE 3: Hi-C ]
I want you to fuck me and suck me and never stop lickin
(Ah-a, I ain't finna do all that) Nah, I'm just bullshittin
Cause deep down I really love ya
Hey girl, I ain't lyin, I put that on ( ? )
Now what I say might sound like drag
But I hope this bullshit don't make you mad
I know I promised you some money for you to fix your nails
But it always seem like we goin to the motel
But hey baby, I can handle this
All my homeboys say I'm so muthafuckin skanless
That it's a goddamn shame
And young girls shouldn't be allowed to mention my name
So what, I don't care, I don't give a fuck
Cause when it comes to pussy I just line 'em up
I fuck one, then I say who's next
Hi-C get mo' pussy than a goddamn Kotex
A Rough Rider when I'm fuckin a hoe
I drop my dick like Macho Man dropped the elbow
There's no age limit that I fuck
But I prefer you to be 13 on up
I been servin bullshit, now have you got your share?
Quik, tell me was it funky? (Aw, fuck yeah)

Yeah
Haha
And we just bullshittin
Y'all niggaz know
Cause I'm takin over
Tony-A in the house
Yeah-yeah
We doin it
And the beat goes on
Haha
That old gangster shit
All the niggaz in my neighborhood
Y'all niggaz stay up
I ain't forgot about y'all
Yeah, all the homies
We gon' flow on
Born in Louisiana, nigga, raised in Compton
Y'all know what's up</pre>
