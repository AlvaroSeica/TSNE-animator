[Verse 1: Jehst]
I exist in a state of consistant transition
Plans shifting, with insuffitient ambition
Man listen, this is my advice
die or fight, get caged in or take flight
On the page inside the margin I make light
Appear in the form of the words I write
It's all solar, from the lows to the highs
But you're blinded by the wool pulled over ya eyes
by over-sized flies who feed off waste
Take the icing on the cake, and leave without trace
The man without a face, I stay anonymous
The way we livin day to day stays monotonous
like your bland sound, but with the weight of the world on top of us 
we still stand ground and brake down your fasination with the fabrication of the truth
Make use of your imagination in the pursuit of expression
Not as a disguise to hide behind when undressing
Ya bredrin, I recon the question is this:
'To be or not to be?' A simple lesson in risk

[Sampling/Scratches]

[Verse 2: Jehst]
Imparting this text is my only life after death, I'm left gasping for breath
Asking for less tention and stress, about to suffocate
It feels like I need devine intervention to resuscitate me 
Lately it's like frustration has taken its hold
Restraining me from breaking the mold
or making the most of my creative control
Times taking its toll, I'm elevating my soul by
taking the old to the new like nice and smooth
My voice highlights the groove
The break sets the mood, I express my attitude
towards my foes and those who show no gratitude
You can't calulate my longitude or latitude
Navigate my catacombe, or reach my altitude
I'm too high, far too fly to stay stationary
Basically I keep it constructive, like masonary
Blantenly disruptive, and it's disgracefully corruptive
System plagued with injustice
But this is purity, you cant touch this
It's much more to me, than just fuck this
But I can't let that discourage
I salvage anything of value from the rubbish and repair
I won't be driven into submission or dispair
I prepare for war and hear the rhythem of the snare ...(right there)
