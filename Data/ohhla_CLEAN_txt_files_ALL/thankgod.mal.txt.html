Spark the Marley to meditate like Marcus Garvey
The marching army, the feds got they archers on me
Keep a arsenal, the thugs in the hood, they partial
But they don't wanna be the next Thurgood Marshall
Marvel through the harshest hardships
And you don't have to be Dr. Drew to hear the heart skip
This is war in art, I am Basquiat
From block to block like Haile Selassie

Back in the day when Showtime had a Magic passer I was
Bein instilled with the pride of a Panther, I was
Seizin the time just tryin to get ( ? )
Red Foxx as a pioneer, pay attention to Sanford
Check the facts where you gettin all your data from
For that Rolex you should thank Benjamin Banneker
A freestyle should be called a Harriet Tubman
And the afros we dedicate to Fredrick Douglass

When Nina Simone was down south singin Mississippi Goddam
We didn't have a hot chance in hell to rock jams
One mic stand, Smokey with the Miracles
Mahalia Jackson used to sing all the spirituals
The critical road to greatness had obstacles
Bare-knuckle struggle, the Jack Johnson chronicles
I ran like Jesse Owens over the ocean
Like ( ? ) it was hard as hell keepin the rent paid
[ Styliztik Jones ]
I'm a Buffalo Solider with ( ? )
I'm the Zulu solider you're lookin for
And the day Aaliyah died I really took it hard
Got my book smarts up like Booker T Washington
And Sugar Ray Robinson, I rap from squabblin
Against the oppressor, rise like Clyde Drexler
The death of a giant is bigger than any wrestler
The rest of us riot, Rodney King couldn't lecture us

I'm the Langston Hughes of the language used
Lovin Maya Angelou for her angle views
For the death of Ron Brown, he a angel, too
Playin Gil Scott Heron, drivin in American cars and not carin
Revolution arrogant, photogenic like Gordon Parks
( ? ) a panoramic picture for important parts
I'm the W.E.B. Du Bois of the art
[ KB iMean ]
These cowards claim that they blow calicos
Bigger than Fats Domino
Jackie Robinson stole home, the umpire froze
History wrote, the truth everybody know
Rise to the occasion, a legend like Earl Manigault
Sicker than Wilt Chamberlain, bring it like James Baldwin
Angela Davis fought for black causes
Nowadays all my people tryina get chedar
Ain't willin to die for a change like Medgar Evers
