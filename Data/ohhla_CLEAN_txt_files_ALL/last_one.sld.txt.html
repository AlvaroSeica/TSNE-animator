I used to think that I was the only one going through phases
I used to think that I was the only one probing through pages
Until I took to performing on stages.
That's when I had to face the fact that I'was the only one flowing for changes
Sometimes I feel like I'm the last man
The only one who thinks that cream ain't making the man
I thought by taking a stand, I'd make my name in the sand
But now it seems that I ain't making the band, damn
Sometimes I stop and think, Am I the last person
Who can wear his symbol on his shirt without the intentions to merch it
Headlines alerting, See the state that the Earth's in
And I see these people and I wonder they care or if they're hurting
I've never felt like this world was my home
It's like I'm not my zone
On my own, all alone

Sometimes I feel like I'm the last one
Living in a century filled with bad puns
Victim of the Gods' cruel joke, last son
Last one

They tell me...
Why you so concerned with changing minds
Don't waste your time, don't waste your time
You can never breach the cultural divide
It's all states of mind. It's all states of mind
If you can't beat em join em, why take a side?
So don't waste your time, don't waste your time
Cuz you may never get a moment to shine
There's no place or time, there's no place or time
I used talk about the culture and where it was headed
And what's the reason temptation is engraved and imbedded
Yeah I was told they used to roll with unleaded
Now we were told to fight the power but it seems that we kept on forgetting
It's all about the politics of oppression
And if they hadn't been abandoned well then maybe y'all wouldn't be stressin'.
Yeah I'm feeling like the last one investing
Both their heart and mind, but I guess we'll burn and crash when it's destined

Sometimes I feel like I'm the last one.
Living in a century filled with bad puns.
Victim of the Gods' cruel joke, last son.
Last one
