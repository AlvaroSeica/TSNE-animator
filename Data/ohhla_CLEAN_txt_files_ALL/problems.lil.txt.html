[Intro]
Holloween H20, nigga!
I'm hot, I'm hot, it's a fire, nigga. It's a fire in here
Aye, it's hot, whoodie! Whoodie, I'm hot! Ahhhh, Damn!
You feel me? I'm talking bout Lil B new mixtape shit
You a motherfuckin' gangsta
Lil B I told you before you a thug, but you're a nerd, haha
You're a nerd, nigga... happy Halloween

[Verse]
I come in the cuts, niggas know I knock ya wig back
Halloween H2O, tell me where ya friends at
I got some drugs that you wouldn't wanna touch
Got the pipes in the back, where ya light em from the front
You don't gotta understand, because I'm talking from the street perspective
I leave niggas lit, silent blessings
Don't test this, relay the message, I'm coming from all directions
Twin Glocks, two bodies, four caskets
I'm a go cause, nigga, I can't fucking have it
I took a fade now a nigga got a lot of baggage
Bullets comin' out the wall like Bodysnatchers
More bodies, pump shotties, no body bout homi except them boys with them cold bodies
No respect for bitches or yo fuckin' shooters
I'm sending numbers off the top like a fuckin' ruler
I put you niggas in a box like a old computer

[Outro]
Talkin' bout beef, I'm talkin' bout the piece
Niggas like me, I got problems in the streets
I'm a step my game up, these niggas so creep
I don't give a fuck, I got problems in the streets
I'm talkin' bout beef, I'm talkin' bout the piece
Niggas like me, I got problems in the streets
I'm a step my game up, these niggas so creep
I don't give a fuck, I got problems in the streets</pre>
