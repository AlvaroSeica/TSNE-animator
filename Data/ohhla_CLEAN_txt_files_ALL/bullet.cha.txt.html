[Chamillionaire]
They be tryin to shoot shots, I just watch they gun fail
That just make me stronger, all that hate just came with dumbbells
Ain't that Koopa some'n else? Got no time for duck tales
Y'all can't see the picture, y'all must be lookin at thumbnails
Suicide's like bye-bye, he don't really ride fly
Pull 'em curtains off top, voil√°, while I
look at that like mama, every day I fly high
Never at the crib, when I come home it's just a drive-by
"Brrat-brrat", yeah that's that, these ain't just no rap snacks
I'm too busy eatin while it larger than my backpack
Lizard on my snap-back, just accept the fact that
I'll keep collectin paper 'til it looks like I'm a pack rat
Had the shoebox stash when other young'uns had a bug jar
I didn't have no Jordans but I made enough for a car
Gave that to my mother, none of my hustle is subpar
Must be out yo' mind cause it's my mind that got us this far
And I'm just

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
So bullet-proof, so bullet-proof, so bullet-proof
They know they nothin, they be tryin to criticize all I've done
I see 'em takin shots one by one
They pull and shoot, I keep pullin through, like I'm bullet-proof
It seems like everbody's aimin at you when you're number one
But that don't stop me baby, I'm not done

[Chamillionaire]
I don't really know how they can find the success
But I know the way I be comin down is the best
See they gon' try their best to turn your mind to a mess
So when you never mind 'em then it's mind is distress, uhh

They gon' try to block yes, that's part of the process
They look for success but now they see it like the Loch Ness
Paper in my pockets, they can't even buy this
Yeah we eatin real good but they really can't even digest
Fake is what they want to, they can't handle the truth
So I just get my camp wisdom like Iraq does with the troops
I'm the truth so what's proof? Hope you wear your taboos
They say don't burn no bridges, try to cross me and get cut loose
I'm 100 plus deuce, shadow proof ain't gun proof
But try to get some head they try to strike you through the sunroof
They just want my chair and tryin to push me out like the goose
Losers give me headaches but success can be my masseuse
Let me get my real robe, let 'em know I fear no
evil but that evil tryin to whisper in my ear though
Wanna make a deal bro? Tell me who you'd kill fo'
What you need to ask me is to tell you who I live fo'
Cause I'm just

[Chorus]
