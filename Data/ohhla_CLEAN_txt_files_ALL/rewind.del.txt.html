Just don't kick my bread

Check my comprehensive catalog of crabs
I'm daft, i battle all like i don't have it all
Having guard, battle scar, galactic cut
Got rhymes per capita
I'm shining through the averture
But i'm not gonna bust no caps for ya' (Naaa)
That's another genre
I'm the black bomber, track charmer
Sack burner, distract verters
If it ain't that urgent
Nerve prints, words sentinal, invisible
Infa-del, in a cell i hella clever endeavors
Immeasurable with only havin' a go incredible
Melodramatic, with tales from the tablet
You fail 'cause you average
Regardless of your sales and your status
You extra baggage
I bamboos are like mobbin' in a Landcruiser down McArthur
Artistic archer, autistic misfit
Y'all get the sickness when i spit the wickedness
Split ya wig like kid ignorant
Leave ya headless like Icabod
I infuriate and tick you off, stick go pop
Hip-hop's too dificult, too me it's a cult
Lyrics lacerate and slit ya' throat
Leave ya' brain down like Episcopal
Sniffin' coke, i don't know
Different strokes, so respect me before i whip out ol' Betsy
Surgically remove you from my testis
Purposelssly improve you just to see who the best be
But sold, i'm sexy, take a poll
And know the prestige, large lefty
I automate, animate my soul sanitation
Like i got a canvass painting
Manifestation
Hey, who ever hear of this?
Deltron-Z be a lyricist
Frontin' on ya flake false superiest
Drop you delirious
Dead serious, the hairiest mic mysterious
Hey peep who ever hear of this
Deltron-Z be a lyricist 
Frontin' on ya flake false superiest
Drop you delirious
Dead serious, the hairiest mic mysterious
Go ahead, try symbiosis
But most rap artists don't have any focus
Think they flippin' chips
Try penny brokers
Clips go no penny loafers
Get my album, i'll show you how it's done
Delatocious, hella atrocious with focals
My throat holds verbal choke holds
Broke hoes see escrows
My goals are not rifles
I flows scrimmage like those micro-knots
You might go pop
And i might grow crops
So get the Gestapo
You riskin' a pot full of gold
Full of zodiac signs at half-time
Re-enact rhymes from my past life for a flashlight
Man, you don't know the half
Dash right to the phonograph
Throw your Bawlderdash
Coordinates confirmed
Subordinates will learn
My ordinance is stern
So supportin' my firm
Is the only way in this lonely age when your goin' craze
This style is sewed and paid for, 'cause i made more
Water emcees like the Bay shore
Bullets grazed doors in Oakland where they lay law
Del is going AWOL with napalm ink bombs
Taped to my arms like the town choir
Now i'm a miser, strider, spitting cider, ripping ply wood
Forgive beef diggin' lyrical cheapskates
Try Del and win the sweepstakes
When i make it so hot, it's seathin', off the deep end
Stop ya' breathin'
Caught ya' sleepin'
No ya' peakin', like you've eaten a hundred micro-dots
Wreck ya' Equinox, delete every piece of props
Leave ya' perferated
Curb ya' hatred
Serve ya matrix in the Word Olympics
Complete, be furnished with burners like Ted Turner
I broadcast the classics, fabulous, fantastic
Hey, who ever hear of this?
Deltron-Z be a lyricist
Frontin' on ya flake false superiest
Drop you delirious
Dead serious, the hairiest mic mysterious
Hey who ever hear of this
Deltron-Z be a lyricist 
Frontin' on ya flake false superiest
Drop you delirious
Dead serious, the hairiest mic mysterious

And the survey says, go practice or something man</pre>
