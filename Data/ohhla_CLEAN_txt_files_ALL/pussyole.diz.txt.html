Rudeboy, don't watch that 
Cause if it's arms-house, I'll rock that
And if it's on top, you know I got that
Come through with a big baseball bat

Like blood, don't make me get old-school
Blood, don't make me get old-school
Blood, don't make me get old-school
Blood, don't make me get old-school

[ Hook ]
Stop rolling with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussyole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rolling with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him
Why you rolling with that pussyole?
Moving with that pussyole?
You know that he's a pussyole
I showed you he's a pussyole
He's always been a pussyole
So he'll always be a pussyole
But you're still with that pussyole
You must be a pussyole

[ Verse 1 ]
That's that bredder always fronting like he's strong
Sneaky fake fuck always running to his brother when it's on
Hardly backs the beef, last one swinging
First one running, making up stories, he's a chief
Bringing bredders to the ends, acting up
Putting on a show, trying talk funny to his friends
But he's really not a don, they know it
And you know it, so something must be seriously wrong
Cause you're parring, his mum calls you darling
But his brother has got you shotting with no way of stopping
I heard you both had beef with an older brer
You took a spark and he just stood there
Now that boy's a pussyole, say it ain't true
It started because of him and ended with you
And that's the kind of shit that's gonna continue
But I guess it don't matter if that's what you're into

[ Hook ]

[ Verse 2 ] 
The sun the biggest star in the sky
But naturally it's gotta make room for the moon every night
Everything's got its time limit, even relationships
Everything's sunny when the friendship's tight
A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend with no money and no weed
Can flip the script at a ridiculous speed
And make a best friend an ex-friend for the p
A couple of years ago in my road yout days, 
I was into pirate radio, I guess it was a phase 
There was this one particular MC man
Was a older in my ends and I thought he was the dan
So I started rolling with him kind of like a little brother
My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover
I didn't think that it was nothing more than jealousy
But I wish I would've listened every time he told me

[ Hook ]

[ Verse 3 ]
Stay away from them pussyoles, you can have it all
Live endlessly, tremendous, forever ball
Stand up for something, or for anything you'll fall
But differently, know when not to lose your cool
Cause it ain't what you show, its what you 're concealing
Put a smile on the deepest negative feeling
Stand tall even when they're hating and they're scheming
Then watch your money rise right to the ceiling
Stand tall even when they're hating and they're scheming
Then watch your money rise right to the ceiling
