[Frank Ocean]
She singin - bitch I'm paid, and that's all I gotta say
I'm like who knew? Who knew? Who knew?
That after all the years I'd make a Weezy fan
out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke, Chris Martin
and U2, U2, U2
When you met me I was Three 6, Pimp C, Bun B
8Ball and MJG, yeah
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, al-ways

[Chorus]
I wrote a letter to the sky sayin maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you tryin to diss me?
Cause you know you're my baby, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah</pre>
