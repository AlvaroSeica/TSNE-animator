[Q-Tip and Amanda Diva] (Q-Tip)
Get down... (Make it easy)
Good God, make it easier now 
(Good God, make it easier now)
Get down... (Man and woman get down)
Good God, make it easier now 
(Good God, make it easier now)
Get down... (Man and woman get down)
A-doogah-doogah-doogah-doogah-dah doo

[Q-Tip]
Man and woman be patrollin the earth
Puttin shit in the game...
Citizens...of the world, we runnin out
Precious time is a grain of sand..
Ignored by the hand
(Work hard man everyday)
Work hard man everyday (for who?)
For another man's plan...
Man orders woman when he come home..
Getcha ass in the air!
(My woman wants it just as much as I do)
Woman wants it just as much as he does
but makes as if she don't care..
Man and woman in the same where I'm from..
We havin things on the mind..
Minimum wage and the internet page (she cry)
Protect themselves from crime...
The bluest collar on the brownest of skin
White, yellow, red too...
They don't care...who it is..
They watchin you...
Conspiracies, so you might as well dance
Gettin down, Zulu..
Man and woman, yo you might as well dance
Gettin down, Zulu, c'mon, c'mon..

[Amanda Diva]
Gettin down is somethin to do between woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand
Gettin down is somethin to do between woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand
Men and women, what's goin on...inside of our minds?

[Q-Tip]
Oh no...sing it one more time, c'mon

[Amanda Diva]
Gettin down is somethin to do between woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand

[Q-Tip]
Check it out...
Red man was the first on the continent
this you gotta understand
Woman not behind, she's right beside him there
and they both toil land
White man fightin for independance from, an old empire
Woman makes a flag for a new nation and
lets the flag waves high
Black woman is stripped of her kingdom and
bought the breastfeeding new..
Black man...mentally...he broke it too..
But the cream always rise to the top
That's what men and women do
Man/woman always doin the dance
One wops, one pops..
We'd be lucky if we both find a groove
that we both can lock
Can man be stronger if a woman was there?
I would have to say yes
Can woman make it without men being there?
She would have to be blessed
Woman and man are the spiritual forces
brought together to live..
Good thing there's many of us here in the world today
Find a good one to give, let's go, c'mon...

[Amanda Diva and Q-Tip]
Good God make it easier now...
Get down..
Good God make it easier now...
Get down..
A-doogah-doogah-doogah-doogah-dah doo
Get down..</pre>
