[Intro  Oozeela]
I have so many memories
Of when you would hurt me
You probably don't remember me
Because back then I was poor and dirty
When I pulled up on the block
After Basketball
I had no locks you wouldn't call
But now when you feel cold
You want my sweater
And now I'm gone forever

[Young Mav]		
She says love me, but she loves me not
Cause Mami never loved me till my sales was hot
I used to love her when I worked at HMV
But it wasn't mutual till MTV
BPM, and Much played the video, WOW
Now you wanna catch up cause you miss me now
Invite you to shows but you'd never come
But when we opening, you want yourself plus one
Succeed or fail, sell one or one mil
If your love was honest, you'd be there regardless
You ain't looking for love you want attention
You want a man who says you leave me breathless
You want a man who'll tell you you're important
Then when he phones screen your calls and ignore him
Now I don't know what kind of dudes you date
But I don't quote Jon B or Baby Face

[Chorus  Oozeela  1X]
Kiss mi neck back
If you think you hot

[Back Up Vocalists]
Gal you too Stoosh

[Chorus  Oozeela]
Mi wi tell you
Seh you not

[Back Up Vocalists]
Gal you too Stoosh

[Chorus  Oozeela]
Hitey-titey
You pretend to be

[Back Up Vocalists]
Gal you too Stoosh

[Chorus  Oozeela]
How you think seh
You a queen

[Dirt Gritie] 		
I only asked for dance, why'd you turn up your nose
Well miss, I don't stand next to hoes
Unless we running the train, and I'm next to go
Only thing on your mind is testiculs
And how many credit cards, does that man hold?
Asking brothas for a drink when'd you get so bold?
Hmm, let me think, hell no
Selfish chick, I wish I never holla'd at yo
She's well traveled, and I don't mean she travels a lot
You must be gypsy the way that you be reading them cocks
Believe it or believe it not, we from the same block
That's why I holla'd at Ma
But she too stuck up, face skin up and bruck up
Forget your manners, that's not how you were brought up
Who would've thought you's a material girl
But if creams what you're after then I'm scared of you girl

[Chorus  Oozeela  1X]
Kiss mi neck back
If you think you hot

[Back Up Vocalists]
Gal you too Stoosh

[Chorus  Oozeela]
Mi wi tell you
Seh you not

[Back Up Vocalists]
Gal you too Stoosh

[Chorus  Oozeela]
Hitey-titey
You pretend to be

[Back Up Vocalists]
Gal you too Stoosh

[Chorus  Oozeela]
How you think seh
You a queen

[Bigga Nolte]		
Now you looking lovely, why you acting all stoosh
Is it cause you got two kids and you still look so good
Or is it cause you got men try'na make you wifey
Well let me tell you something, them man nuh like me
Yes your looks is what attracted me
But your mind's turning this to a catastrophe
At first you laugh at me, and now you see I got game
Now you wanna come and give me your real name
Out'a awdah, you're too out'a awdah
You have two pickney, and three baby fa'das
Now you wan come say it's mine
Or you wan come waist my time
Or you wan come take what's mine, so you could live like you ballin'
I guarantee girl them things naw be gwanin'
At first I really thought you wanted me
I guess you just want to live for free, ay girl

[Bridge  Oozeela  1X]
Pop your balloon sky walker
And come back to the earth
When you shit gold and diamonds
Sell it and buy a new purse
For what it's its worth
You bleed, when I bleed
You pee, when I pee
You cry and I weep
You lie and I steal
You are just but a woman
Only human baby

[Chorus  Oozeela  1X]
Kiss mi neck back
If you think you hot

[Back Up Vocalists]
Gal you too Stoosh

[Chorus  Oozeela]
Mi wi tell you
Seh you not

[Back Up Vocalists]
Gal you too Stoosh

[Chorus  Oozeela]
Hitey-titey
You pretend to be

[Back Up Vocalists]
Gal you too Stoosh

[Chorus  Oozeela]
How you think seh
You a queen</pre>
