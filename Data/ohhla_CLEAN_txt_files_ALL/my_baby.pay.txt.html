[Chorus] Mr. Sancho (Fingazz)
You are my baby girl(my baby girl)
You are my everything(my everything)
You are my baby girl(my baby girl)
You are my everything (my baby girl)

[Verse 1](Payaso)
You know your my baby girl 
Even gangsters need love in this crazy world
Everyday out late on these streets
I still come home to you creep between the sheets 
I put away my heat and lay down by your side 
After we make love its back to the south side
Thats right we're like bonnie and claude
So stay close by as I dip my lowride
I got so much pride because your my lady
And unlike them other groupies who act all shady
And maybe one day soon I'll make you my wife
Cause lovin a gangster is a way of life

[Chorus]
You are my baby girl(my baby girl)
You are my everything(my everything)
You are my baby girl(my baby girl)
You are my everything (my baby girl)

[Verse 2]
I know your parents dont want me around
Cause I'm a thug from the wrong side of town
Baby girl my love is true and I'll do anything to stay with you
I dont care about those other girls 
Your all I need in this whole wide world
You should know your my everything 
You get me through all the stress and pain
In the rain you make the sunshine through
Take away the clouds and make the sky blue
Its still the same girl in my same dreams
The same one who tought a gangster what love means

[Chorus]
You are my baby girl(my baby girl)
You are my everything(my everything)
You are my baby girl(my baby girl)
You are my everything (my baby girl)

[Verse 3]
I never thought that this love would last
Just thinking about the past
At last you took a chance on me
It'll always be the girl of my dreams
And it seems this could last forever
Through any season through any weather
I remember when I took your hand 
I know right there that I was your man
Even though that our lifes have changed
The love we had will still remain
Its still the same girl in my same dreams
The same one that tought a gangster what love means

[Chorus]
You are my baby girl(my baby girl)
You are my everything(my everything)
You are my baby girl(my baby girl)
You are my everything (my baby girl)</pre>
