[Intro: Cno Evil]
Oh my God... yeah...
Li Mouse... Cno Evil...
Rodentz.. White Plains...
Uh... ahh... ahhhhhh-oh

[Li-Mouse]
Microphone checker, swinging sword lecture
Cheddar inspector, supreme cheese protector
Best idea is to get these fools all ready
Leave 'em bankrupt, like they was Dodge &amp; Chevy
Mouse, comes on the track, mad heavy
Dance all night til your ass gets sweaty
Lift your ass right off the floor
C &amp; Li in this bitch, yes, you do adore
Shake it, move it, do what you think is right
Me do a little dance? I just might (sike!)
You know we come through with a wide range
Tight game, ignite flames, yeah, it's White Plains
In your area, style knocking down barriers
Stine Goosebumping beats, there's no scarier
Cno, tell 'em their's never gonna heal right
And tell them, how this shit's gonna feel like, ight?

[Cno Evil]
Yo, I was running through funeral homes, and seen the bones
C &amp; Li here to test and, knock on your dome
When you go home, Rappers On Demand, pick up your phone
We still Enterprising New Technical Zones
You fall down to your doom, just like cartoons rock
Flying in your house "Up", but then balloons pop
And the Academy Awards, you know they "picks R/Pixar"
And I mean The Rodentz, Mouse still race "Cars"
We "Incredible", you action figures is living "Toy Stories"
"Bugged" about Life", that don't do nothing for me
Microphone "Monsters Incorporate" your TiVo
You try "Finding" lyrics? You gon' "need mo/Nemo"
With a fresh pair of "wallies/Wall-E's", you gon' ask who he?
Mouse &amp; Chipmonk, cook that shit up like "Ratatouille"
Pituitary glands, can't understand our "Method"
You "red/Red" it all night, "Man", you still can't get it

[Outro: Cno Evil w/ Li-Mouse]
Yo, yo, check it, yo, yo, yo, yo, you still can't get it
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, you still can't get it
Yo, yo, yo, yo, White Plains, yo, yo, yo, yo, you still can't get it
Yo, Cno, yo, Li Mouse, yo, yo, yo, yo, you still can't get it</pre>
