[Hook]
Yeah they tell me sugar coat it, dumb it down but I can't
Might as well could deny the Jesus and be ashamed but I ain't...imma saint
Til the day I see the grave I'm going hard in the paint
It's the only We hope we got dats why I'll die for the faith imma saint

[Verse 1]
Used to be where I could only trust me and myself
and then that Heavy metal devil that could send em straight to he'll wit it 
thought it was no helping it my selfishness was celibate
I sell a bit but I make sure I don't sit up in that cell a bit
i'd yell a bit but only when hurt came for certain
illiterate ain't know that the word came
but then that that light hit me and unblinded me
Jesus paid a price fo' me that's how I gained the right ta be the son of God I'd like to be
changed my heart and gave me a desire for his work mayne
kill me if you want but I'm gone get back out that dirt mayne
not yet what I'm gonna be but not what I used to be
bless his name forever who would chose me and start using me
used to love my sinning fulla greed fulla hate
I might say that I love Jesus but that talk was really fake
be lustin for ya cousin if it wasnt for his Grace
yeah he took me outta nothin and he made ya boy a saint

[Verse 2]
You got to understand Jesus agreed back in eternity
to sign a bloody covenant and take a deadly turn for me
He ain't just agree he fulfilled it to the death of em
he took that bloody cup that's meant for us str8 to the neck and yeah
he swallowed all that bitterness that pain and affliction
ain't a soul in hell with pain comparable to this one
brought me to repentance homie I'm blood purchased
and daily I'm conformed to his holiness so I worship
Jesus finished the work he resurrected on High
that means he beat death and best believe so will I
see some believe they can fly but I believe I can die
resurrect leave the earth and live forever with God
He will march through the sky while the stars sing his praises
the planets dance around and the universe is amazed
and me I get to gaze upon his beauty for days
man if I could be anything baby I'd be a saint

[Verse 3]
You might think I'm crazy like some kinda urban misfit
but first I hated church I'd only pray to give my wish list
I'd be just like you doing my dougie in the club folk
I promise I ain't it choose it I was chosen to loved on
eyes low blowing dro that's the life I used to know
but Jesus chopped me up and slowed me down just like that Houston flow
a dead man until somebody hit me with the hardest facts
the Gospel hit my heart I guess that's what you call a heart attack
I'm looking at Ephesians 2 like what did Jesus see in you 
nothin by his grace he chose to love on folk like me and u 
and I don' t understand it homie I Neva planned it
I was chasing money and fast women and man
then I met the great I am/son of man or the lamb
snatched ya boy up outta hell/ and got working for his plans
Used think I was the man/til I met em
all that arrogance and pride I dead em and fo'get em/ Imma SAINT!</pre>
