[General Larry Platt]
Pants on the ground! Pants on the ground!
Lookin like a FOOL with ya pants on the ground!
With the gold in your mouth, hat turned sideways
Pants hit the ground, call yourself a cool cat
Lookin like a fool, walkin downtown
WITH YA PANTS ON THE GROUND! Giddy up
Hey get ya pants off the ground, lookin like a fool
Walk, talkin wit YA PANTS ON THE GROUND!
Giddy up!! HEY, get ya pants off the ground!
LOOKIN LIKE A FOOL WITH YA PANTS ON THE GROUND
Gold in the mouth, hat turned sideways
Pants hit the ground, call yourself a cool cat
Lookin like a fool, walk, talkin
WITH YA PANTS ON THE GROUND! Boom! Whoa! Yes!
Lookin like a fool, on, the ground
With the gold in your mouth, hat turned sideways
Pants hit the ground, call yourself a cool cat</pre>
