Song:   Happy Birthday to Who?
Typed by: Byg_Balla

[Chorus]
Today's the day the Lord has made for us to share in a special way
So everybody join and sing "Happy Birthday!"
Happy Birthday! It's your Birthday!
Happy Birthday! It's your Birthday!
Happy Birthday, To who?, To who?, To Who?

[Tonic]
Ok, So I get invited to this Birthday fling
But it's crazy cause I don't normally do the "birthday" thing
You know, I'd rather chill at the crib
Lay up inside with my remote, barbecue Herrs and my Xbox Live
But the "rah rah" made me say this' gonna be big
It's like the whole wide world gonna be at this shin dig
I mean marketers, retail specialists, economists
But the invite said the Birthday boy was anonymous- How crazy is that?
And I heard by attending companies
Could go from being in the red to the black
Who ever this dude is he's profound
You talk about balloons and streamers, yo they lit up the whole downtown
So I'm like "If I go how am I gonna dress, Hip-Hop or chic?"
I heard of people actually getting' off of work for a week
Nah, I ain't missing this, it's too big
Let me go dish out some punches and celebrate with whoever's birthday this is

[Chorus]

[Tonic]
Hey yo so I got to the spot, Where all the hoop-lah be
And yo I just realized, man I ain't RSVP
I looked left and it was Ms. R-E-S-P-E-C-T
This joint was jumpin' like an after hour speak easy
I start walking around slow, you know, you gotta walk slow
Cause pimpin' is in style now and I'm a Gigolo
Man, it's like this party should've been in heaven
Cause it was Good Times like James and Florida Evans
I mean, people lightin' candles, blowing out cake
People makin' wishes to be good for goodness sake
Then they started taking all these gifts from under this tree
And giving them all out, and yo the joints was free
I was like "this is crazy B", cause in mind was money
It's like somebody else's party and the dough's for me
Well the Birthday Boy missin' out in my eyes
He's probably playin' around
Gonna walk up in here on us and be like "Surprise!"

[Chorus]

[Tonic]
Hey, trust me this is nice, but it's weird
This dude must be suffering from some kind of fear
Is he afraid to wade in emotional, societal waters?
What? He got a multiple, social anxiety disorder?
Just then I saw a guy like Little Jack Horner
Just sittin' in the back, way over in the corner
And I was like "nah this dude ain't gonna ruin this fun"
Let me walk over here and give this wallflower some sun
I said, "Yo dun, you letting us down like the horse Smarty"
He said, "Yo my bad, is this your party?"
I said, "Nah, but you chippin' up my joy"
HE said, "For real, well I'M the BIRTHDAY BOY
I'M THE BIRTHDAY MAN, slash, THE BIRTHDAY GOD
Now you can call me JESUS, or you can call ME LORD"
I was floored; I said, " Forgive us, we gave out all the gifts"
HE said, "I forgive you, its cool - for real, don't even trip
I ain't worried about no gifts
And ain't nothing wrong with Christmas
I ain't even really mad at the real St. Nicolas
He said, "I'm more concerned about those that recognize my worth
And chose today to signify the significance of my birth
So I'm chillin, can't nothing dim MY shine
Cause from now to eternity, I'MA still get MINE"
I was like, man it's been a bugged out day!
And I just stood there, ain't even know what to say, but
