[Intro]
Yo! I'm a Tasmanian Devil (uh-huh)
Prevail's the Road Runner (yo)
Rob the Viking (wild) yo

[Mad Child]
I love beats by the Viking and the Alchemist
People get inside my head like John Malkovich
My life is gettin complicated like calculus
I feel like jumping off a bridge or a balcony
So - sometimes I sit around, might sulk a bit
But still I'm holdin on tight like a Vulcan grip
Instead I think about the suicide that I'll commit
I'm pullin killer crazy words from the alphabet
Cooped up, sometimes I gotta leave the house and shit
Otherwise my life will turn into the House of Sin
I'm runnin into old friends askin "How've you been?"
I lost three million dollars dog, how've you been~?!
My teeth are fallin out my head so my mouth on red
My teeth are rotten and there's holes in my couch and shit
Yeah, every day reminders the truth it hurts
Cause I got cigarette burns in my Gucci shirts
Yo Mad Child I never write a goofy verse
And still I stare into the mirror thinking "You've been cursed"
Listen to your song, I have to pop a roofie first
Cause I am nuclear, when I walk in a booth it's church

[Chorus]
I'm on some Bruce Lee, "Enter the Dragon" shit
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" shit
We are warriors, "Red Dragon" kid
There's warmth under the wing of the dragon bitch
I'm on my kung-fu hustle!
My black six-nine Mustang, it got muscle
Mad samurais don't hide, we just rush 'em
You want "Beat Street" now we cold crush 'em!!

[Prevail]
I'm the Swollen Army general, we gon' swarm on you
My performance quite like me, I'm "Moulin Rouge"
I'ma cut into your crew like some cordon bleu
I'm sipping on some Gran Dam, you drinkin Kuve brew
I make your heart skip a beat like it's new Beirut
And if you don't know what to do then you should stay on your stoop
People always ask me what part do I play in the group?
What do I say? I'm just a dude in a Tom Ford suit
Space face erase cartoon, you dudes is Betty Boop
Make a tune and break bread and then get jetty with the loot
Play around the Greyhound and squeeze the juice out your grapefruit
Prev One, Ketel One, Belvedere, or Grey Goose
Major league beat down, a homerun, a bass group
Major labels always wonder when we gonna break loose
Can't stop the profit motherfucker, I'm like Jeru
S&amp;M it's us again, our people know we stay true
I'm on some "Apocalypse Now"
"Behind Enemy Lines" like "Black Hawk Down"
"The Shining" "The Crazies" "The Happening" "The Town"
Keep your "Eyes Wide Shut" when the crows come around

[Mad Child]
I'm on my kung-fu hustle!
My black six-nine Mustang, it got muscle
Mad samurais don't hide, we just rush 'em
You want "Beat Street" now we cold crush 'em!!
