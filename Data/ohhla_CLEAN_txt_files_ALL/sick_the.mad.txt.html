(Kwamé did it)

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Your boy Skillz (woo!), uh, uh, K-1 , what up?
Yeah, I mean, I hear y'all rappers, but I don't really hear y'all rappers
Let's go (haha)

[Verse 1]
Now I'm a explain somethin to ya (uh), I'm hopin ya get it
There's only a few cats left, that's this sick when they spit it
If it's fire, I lit it, he retired, I did it
I don't need to stay charged, I get wired up with it, huh (woo!)
A lot of rappers, a lot of new bodies (uh)
I hear these cats, but I ain't feelin nobody (nope)
And sick, that ain't just somethin to stay
Let me tell you how long I've really been this way
I was sick back in the day when Kane got +War+ (War)
Before you had to have a dance go with your song (song)
I was sick before MC Hammer brought flare to a show
When ?uestlove, was tryin to get his hair to grow
I was sick before hip hop was media's property
When Lil' Wayne used to sing "wobblety wobblety"
And you, you never met a sicker MC
With a flu, there's no way you as sick as me (no)

[Chorus]
SICK - yeah, that's what you listenin for (uh)
If you ain't tryin to be the best, what you spittin for?
I'm (SICK!) - and ain't no comparin me
Cats say I'm sick, I'm like apparently
(Man I'm) SICK! Yep
(So sick)
(So, so sick) (Man I'm)
(So sick)
(So, so sick) (Man I'm)
I'M SICK!
(So sick)
Y'all better think quick fam
Here's a 
nice introduction of how sick I am 

[Verse 2]
I was (SICK) before you could count your bars
Sick before Run and Play was TV stars (woo!)
I was sick before the South had hits (uh)
Sick before you knew how to download somethin this sick
So sick and slick with the tongue (uh)
Sick before 'Ye and Swizz Beatz knew how to chop them drums
I was sick when Beyonce was doin talent shows
Hov was in VA, tryin to move them O's (what up?)
When Teddy Riley was +swingin+ with the +new jacks+
I was a beast back then, I was sick before that
Sick before the A got a buzz (uh)
I was sick before Jeezy knew what a ad lib was (yeahhh)
Sick when 50 had got his first Benz
Big Boi and 3000 were the best of friends
And this sickness here, man it's somethin to see
Who in they right mind thinkin they as sick as me? (come on)

[Chorus]
SICK - yeah, that's what you listenin for (uh)

If you ain't tryin to be the best, what you spittin for?

I'm (SICK!) - and ain't no comparin me

Cats say I'm sick, I'm like apparently

(Man I'm) SICK!

(So sick)

(So, so sick) (uh) (Man I'm)

(So sick)

(So, so sick) (Man I'm) (uh)

SICK!

(So sick)

Y'all better think quick fam

Here's a nice introduction of how sick I am
 
Man, if you ain't writin right now
How you gon' fuck with me?
Come on man

[Verse 3]
Listen yo, I ain't no joke
I used to let the mic smoke
And I was spittin this sick when Bill Gates was broke
I was sick before T.I. was the King
Back20then he was a Prince in the A, just movin them things
I've been sick I promise
I was sick when L.A. Reid was in a group called The Deele and wore eyeliner (ew)
Sick before Dre met Eric Wright
I'm only sick on two occasions, that's day and night
I've been a king in the underground son (uh)
Speakin of +Underground+, I was sick before Pimp met Bun (Pimp C, R.I.P.)
B, y'all got to get it together
I was sick when Einstein teachers told him he wasn't that clever
However, we'll never be even
There's a rapper bigger than me, yeah but he ain't breathin
If you doubtin my sickness, you a hater
I was sick before you realized you hit 'Repeat' on your CD play ...
