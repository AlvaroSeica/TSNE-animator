[Verse 1 - Enrique Iglesias]
I know you want me
I made it obvious that I want you too
So put it on me
Let's remove the space between me and you
Now rock that body (ooh)
Damn I like the way that you move
So give it to me (oh ooh)
'Cause I already know, what you wanna do

[Break - Enrique Iglesias]
Here's the situation, been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, given my reputation
Please excuse me I don't mean to be rude

[Chorus - Enrique Iglesias]
But tonight I'm fuckin you
Oh, you know
That tonight I'm fuckin you
Oh, you know
That tonight I'm fuckin you
Oh, you know
That tonight I'm fuckin you
Oh, you know

[Verse 2 - Enrique Iglesias]
You're so damn pretty
If I had a type then baby it would be you
I know you're ready
If I never lied then baby you'd be the truth

[Break]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Ludacris]
Ha! Luda (Luda), tonight I'm gonna do (gonna do), everything that I  want with you (with you)
Everything that you need, everything that you want, I want a hundred, I wanna stunt with you
From the windows (windows), to the wall (wall), gotta give you, my all (my all)
Winter or the summertime, when I get you on the springs, I'm a make you fall (make you fall)
You got that body that make me wanna get up on the floor just to see you dance (dance)
And I love the way you shake that ass, turn around and let me see them pants (pants)
You stuck with me, I'm stuck with you, let's find something to do (to do)
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude

[Chorus]

That tonight I'm fuckin you
Yeah, tonight I'm fuckin you
Yeah, haha</pre>
