("Because I love you")
("It's the HOTTEST THING!")

[Chorus]
I used to wanna rock a gold chain
A bracelet with two pinky rangs
I got a couple carat ear-rangs
And I don't e'en wear the damn thangs

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I used to want Gucci, used to want Prada
Used to want a Audi 5000 outside bruh 
(OOOOH~!) I thought gettin it was stuntin
I used to think gettin it was frontin
Cubic zirconia until I got sum'thin
UH-OHH! Here comes that rap check
Take me to the store, I need a Rolex (nope!)
No, take me to the car lot, I want a Lex (oh!)
Drivin 'round slow, this is success (yes!)
Look at all these girls looking impressed
YES! I'm in the money, G!
Now watch them bills flee, no money tree

[Chorus 2X]

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I used to want a Rollie instead I bought a Lexus
Now I got women rubbin on my solar plexus
..They wanna know where that money at
But tell me would you love me in a Pontiac (naaaw?)
Now watch 'em scatter like roaches
Got tired of dealin with them vultures
Tryna stick me up like a poster
But Snoop say ain't no love for them hoes, brah!

[Chorus 2X]

[Rapper Big Pooh]
..I had to figure out who I was (who I was)
..Who I ain't, I ain't in clubs
I ain't concerned with lookin nigga rich
All on your television niggerish
RAH RAH, R-R-RAH RAH
Or, BLAH BLAH, B-B-BLAH BLAH
Nor, always talkin 'bout what I got (I got!)
Cause I know them wolf niggaz keep a plot
...That's how you get-

..Think on it
Gold chain, bitch! Ha!</pre>
