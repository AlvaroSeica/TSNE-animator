[Movie Sample]
The shot will be taken from beyond a mile
Only thirty-six men in the World make a shot like that
We need you, Out of all the men alive on the Planet
Your one of the few people who knows what to look for
This guys knows what he's doing, We gotta take em
He's in the center, Take em, Take em now

[Intro: Bronze Nazareth]
Thought for Food volume two
Yeah it's the mixtape man
Thought for Food volume two
Thought for Food volume two just to shook you

[Chorus: Bronze Nazareth]
Yo it's the mixtape bitch, Watch your head
I speak like the Sheik of Iran with sniper plans
Sit like still seeds, Study, Aim at emcees
Sit like still seeds, Study, Aim at emcees

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo my brain on psycho beam, Mainframe title gleam
Idol King, Fuck rap, I'll rap you up in Sing-Sing
Bonsai plant inhaling, Toothbrush shank healing
I'll put you in the morgue with no feeling
Adrenalin sound stroke, Suez Canal scope
Bending lead like Angelina, Heat hunting whistle near ya
Bronze came, Grimm Reaper you been subpoenaed
Billy Zane sniper game don't wait for F.E.M.A
This is thought for food that you receiving
Aim at emcees from a further range then Lincoln
Metal clinking, Line like lightening slivers
Gone like senseless, Megalodon night time swimmers
Inviting ships to drown in whorl pool rivers
Break the backs of resisters, This is invitation to open war
Aim at emcees hoping for a Purple Heart for open gore
The yard's filled with henchmen, Shoot em then we gas drenching
Sniper dimension, Tom Berenger trigger finger flinching
Dead splints, Emcees locked by the clock tower
My plot sour, You ride hour by hour, My lines sinking in like fishermen
Sistine Chapel shots, Love guns, Home of the iron whop
D.N.A. mop, For a hip hop, Cop on the scene drop
Beams locked in, Bronze-lock Holmes
Fully auto raw gold, Always store my gun powder cold
Same way I lave the bodies, Opposite how I hang the shotty
Lots of clips, Each hits the body like a Maserati
Straight probably catch a C.E.O. in the lobby
Now we label owners, We paving over bodies
Formal stolen hobby, Darts travel Godly
I'll probably take you beyond the Earth ??? soundly

[Chorus]</pre>
