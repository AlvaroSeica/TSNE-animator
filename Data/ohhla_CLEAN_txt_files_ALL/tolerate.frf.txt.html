On our chest is weak-in-ess.
The press is telling us liiiiiiiiieessssssss!

We will not tolerate
white men raping black men black men
Taking 'em home, chopping their bones, and smothering them with plastic,
and dipping their head in acid. Wonder if Dahmer

False facts.
Fuck that!  Get my
Gat, from under my hat

Reaching out so we can feel the blind.
Here,
It's clear.

We will not tolerate
FEAR!
