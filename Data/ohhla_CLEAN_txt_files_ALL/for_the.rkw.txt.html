[Chorus]
This for the listeners with big businesses gettin their livin overseas with it
Who get fly as fuck roll up drop a hundred thousand like see niggas
All my jewelry is custom and it's live from the head to the v niggas
We 'gon be gettin it, we 'gon be gettin it and gettin it and gettin it

[Verse One]
Drug trafficker, bank book from Attica
Mac slapper right in your lab and put the Apple on it
Dipped in pajamas, to hold the llamas anacondas
Promotional cuts niggas with choppers on it
Move panaramic, elevator lab with a hammock
Rangler red coke and cabinets
Splex on the mayor, slingin in Disney for the layup
Fresh new whites on you pay us
Back to this emceein dipped in so many diems
Takin it back to baby bm's
Meet me at the manor, while all my niggas sit back and gamble
Put ya house up buy you a lambo
And my lady she a winner, got a real nigga my agenda
Cop you everything give you the pin number 
Style more passion flashin the general
Nasty mixed with raw more on fashion

[Chorus]
This for the listeners with big businesses gettin their livin overseas with it
Who get fly as fuck roll up drop a hundred thousand like see niggas
All my jewelry is custom and it's live from the head to the v niggas
We 'gon be gettin it, we 'gon be gettin it and gettin it and gettin it

[Verse Two]
Russian connect shower head flooded in briquettes  
Come live in my garage with the steps
Blue nose pit the stove cost a hundred we trick
Money you funny, tax write a piff
Covers is Louis, pillows Chanel flowin well
Fish tank Gazelle made me skip
The Honolulu of France, maxin with my boo boo
Between me and you when it's rap I'm a Guru
Everything we buy is fly from Fila to Dida
Catch me overseas near the key eyes
360 B.I. tee on Levi's
Tiger Wood rap version meet 40 midas
Pussy ain't nothin, it's money we want rollin a blunt
Run down your honey with a gun yo
Niggas to bitches the outside visit is rewrapped
Crab darts dedicated to the listeners

[Chorus]
This for the listeners with big businesses gettin their livin overseas with it
Who get fly as fuck roll up drop a hundred thousand like see niggas
All my jewelry is custom and it's live from the head to the v niggas
We 'gon be gettin it, we 'gon be gettin it and gettin it and gettin it</pre>
