[Dollar]
Major niggas in this rap game,
For the fame I let the Dollars represent my name
Shit I trained from the best, I'm aimin' for the range,
We got them thangs, and you know it's in our favor  mane,
Drop the top on the old school eleather classic,
If somebody fuck around with us somebody got to die,
Get 'em niggas, fuckin' with my cheese,
Swarmin' on mother fuckers like Bee's
Oomp Camp

[Sammy Sam]
Tell me how many times I got to prove myself,
With a luger to sell, they gone loose they rep,
They barely reached the step, then they reached for help
Put the chrome to his face and kept him quit to death
Sammy Sam, Young Blood, Intoxicated swarm on 'em
Get the ATF up in here we bough to drop a bomb on 'em
Big Oomp up in this bitch,
Checked he creeped up in his bitch
We Deep up in this bitch
