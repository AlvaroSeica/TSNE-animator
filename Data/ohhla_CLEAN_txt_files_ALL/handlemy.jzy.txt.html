Typed by: AZ Lyrics

let me handle my bizness [x8]

[Verse 1]
I said young was busy counting money how dare you niggaz count me out
made you niggaz trap stars gave you something to trap about
gave you niggaz streets is watchin' , trap or die the inspiration
during the recession and the drought who gave you niggaz motivation
now the streets is talking niggaz is plotting
public enemy number 1 feel like bin laden
5 4 3 2 1 I'm about to blow up
see me off in platinum 2 1 I'm gettin' toed up
take the vodka straight to the head I'm like you know what?
just keep it trned up on these niggaz cause they don't know us
If you never hustled don't matter now then you don't know dawg
that black 745 on dey ass like I'm going to show ya'll

let me handle my bizness [x8]

[Verse 2]
I said you can get with this or, you can get with that shit
that recompressed ready rock, never coming back shit
have you whipping all day and all that's for practice
bow our heads let us pray 20 years under my mattress
now lay me down to sleep I had dem streets dreams
why the hell do you think my song sound like a street theme
never spossed shit where you stay guess that's a street theme
In the streets 24/7 just like a street team

somewhere off in the lonely cell somewhere in prison
they layin' there with they eyes closed seeing my vision
cause they know we come from the same cloths perfect position
they jus glad I left the game when I did, perfect decision

let me handle my bizness [x8]
yeah!

[Verse 3]
all hail your trap highness, your one and only
you know I gotta do it for shake I'm miss homie
everyday I'm out here making em proud he looking on me
nerver thought id say this too loud good looking homie
he say fuck them popcorn ass niggaz that shit is corny
and motherfuck them fake ass niggaz thought you were phony
gotta do it for them niggaz just serve just like you're tony
that come from everyday flippin them birds, just like you showd me
put so many miles on the bucket it needs a oil change
took them bitches out the garage and left them oil stains
you know that shit be taking forever we call it oil face
make you frown up when you see it call that the oil face

let me handle my bizness [x8]
yeah!</pre>
