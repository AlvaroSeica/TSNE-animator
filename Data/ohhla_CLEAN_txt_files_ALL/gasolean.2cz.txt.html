Typed by: AZ Lyrics

See I be rocking truey and my belt by Louie
I hope that ain't your girl cause I know you seen her choosin'
See I be rocking truey and my belt by Louie
I hope that ain't your girl cause I know you seen her choosin'

Yeah, I'm on that gas, and yeah, I'm on that lean
We mix it all together and we call it gasolean
I say Yeah, I'm on that gas, and yeah, I'm on that lean
We mix it all together and we call it gasolean
I say first I hit the gas then I lean
First I hit the gas then I lean [x3]

First I hit the gas turn it up and make it smash
Hit them with they keith sweat cause I'm a make it last
Yeah your bitch is like is and my car is like an outfit
Put some shoes on that bitch count money till I get alrighted
And my belt by Louie, and your girlfriend shoes
And keep your eyes on a road before you crash like a computer
And my money long when I shop I need them [?]
Shawty playing good, man I think I found the toe
Toll up in that [?] hop up by the [?]
Yeah my name is 2 Chainz I'm about to put on two more
Starting on you niggers if you knew more you would do more
And yeah they fucking with me the long way, d tour

See I be rocking truey and my belt by Louie
I hope that ain't your girl cause I know you seen her choosin'
See I be rocking truey and my belt by Louie
I hope that ain't your girl cause I know you seen her choosin'

Yeah, I'm on that gas, and yeah, I'm on that lean
We mix it all together and we call it gasolean
I say Yeah, I'm on that gas, and yeah, I'm on that lean
We mix it all together and we call it gasolean
I say first I hit the gas then I lean
First I hit the gas then I lean [x4]

I don't love them whose [?] know I'm like
I'm trying to take a bitch like a [?] to hell
Everyday vip the way I draw the lines
Told Shawty check your watch get that fucking ten
Ok, you're not on my mind, Shawty knows [?] time
Life is a getting chill, never ever penalized
Time for [?] trues and my low booze call
It's cold in the boot I should rap in the snow suit
Get my truly sound, my Louie sound
You do mw wrong and you'll be gone
Nine to 3 up tang got me gased up
Hear it with me cold Dean dick now assed up

See I be rocking truey and my belt by Louie
I hope that ain't your girl cause I know you seen her choosin'
See I be rocking truey and my belt by Louie
I hope that ain't your girl cause I know you seen her choosin'
Yeah, I'm on that gas, and yeah, I'm on that lean
We mix it all together and we call it gasolean
I say Yeah, I'm on that gas, and yeah, I'm on that lean
We mix it all together and we call it gasolean
I say first I hit the gas then I lean
First I hit the gas then I lean [x4]</pre>
