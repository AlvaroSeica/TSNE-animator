[Intro: Vusi talking]
I believe that together we can really make a difference
One man cannot make a difference, but if we can partner
if we can have a collective will, and a willingness to make a difference in our nation
We can really do make a difference

[Vocals: Muzi] {Connections Zulu Choir Soloist}
What you have done, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
Wont be long, wont be long...

[Verse 1: Bliss]
All it took was one in a trillion
In a world where they're gunning civilians
Where conspiracies just drop on us like plummeting buildings
Government villains at night, we are renegades who fight
Under a pilgrims plight for a better way of life
See we sail the seas with a sun stained atlas
To escape the day to day mental mundane madness
That consumes us, its true, though my real answer lays
is stepping back to view life's real grand Monet
But crucial issues are lost in this crazy worlds wealth
How can lust for bucks outweigh one baby girl's health?
Through the cyclone we hit the Third World and found heroes
With nothing but still everything, smiling at ground zero

[Chorus: Connections Zulu Choir] {X2}
What you've done here, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it wont be long before you're pulling yourself away

[Verse 2: Eso]
So let the bullets in the air turn to raining rose petals
That covers the Earth's surface while the children throw pebbles
From dreams to themes, to a crack in the concrete
From a seed to a tree, I make it happen at God speed
Whatever happened to increase the peace
Fight the power for people to defeat the beast
Well its right here, its right now
It's anything I plan
It's a poem that proves a point
It's everything I am
So on a rainy day I made my way
to the promised land and back
And now its safe to say in a crazy way
this song is where its at
Its equal verse what wasn't given
Teachers verse the problem children
Evil verse the honest living
People verse the politicians

[Chorus: Connections Zulu Choir] {X2}
What you've done here, Is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it wont be long before you're pulling yourself away (x2)

[Verse 3: Eso]
This is definite
Like the sun will rise
Pure like the thought if I jump I'll fly
I am revolution, my path is belief
So how can they possibly stop what they can't even see

[Bliss:]
See they tax the poor
Their evil got em' coughing up
There's no real freedom under a legal modern mafia
Set the goal and unite, get cocked and take aim
The people are the power to make change
so make way

[Chorus: Connections Zulu Choir] {X3}
What you've done here, Is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it wont be long before you're pulling yourself away</pre>
