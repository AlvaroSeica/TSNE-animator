[Intro]
"Kids is what make me feel so good
 See you looking at the glory that's coming up into the future of life
 See the younger youth is what's gonna make everything to keep going
 after I done passed down the hill"

"Young and black"

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Don't you know, that's it's true
that for me, and for you
the world is a ghetto
Don't you know, don't you know, that's it's true
that for me, and for you
the world is a ghetto

[Interlude]
"Then there's a lot of funky things, in this country
 and there's good things too
 But our rights are more funky than you good
 Shit ain't getting better!"

"We've changed some for the best
 An awful lot of cases for the worst
 and some have not changed at all"

[BJ the Chicago Kid]
Walking down the street, foggy-eyed
Looking at the sky, starry-eyed
Searching for a place, weary eyes
Crying in the night, yeah, yeah, teary-eyed

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
"Dude, we got to get our minds together"

"Any time a brother was shot by another brother in his own neighborhood
 then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket, they need to have the police down there
 Cause see, the niggas is N.A.A.C.P. and
 Niggas ain't acting like colored people"

"If I can't work and make it, I steal and take it"

"(sample incomprehensible) ...if a nigga can put air in a bottle and sell it, he'll do it man
 A nigga can sell anything, I ain't gon' lie"

[Kendrick Lamar]
As I watched the sky change colors
the rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
The black mothers are stressing, the coroners have covered
Another statistic, episodes of a cold summer
The street runners got the same legs as Michael Johnson
The fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
Profanity in the air, the children use the content
The vanity's in the air, that Louis bag haunted
That black girl with the hair that's kind of coarse
Her baby daddy's in court, she smoking on a Newport
Seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
or becoming an AIDS victim while touching them zippers
The life that we living in, things we would do just to live again
How can an angel forever live in sin?

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro]
"You know, well anybody that uses somebody else to gain is pimping"

"Okay, well I'ma tell you what soul brother, lookie here
 Can't nobody pimp you but your pimp-ass self, you understand?"

"Then there's a lot of funky things, in this country
 and there's good things too
 But our rights are more funky than you good
 Shit ain't getting better!"

"We've changed some for the best
 An awful lot of cases for the worst
 and some have not changed at all"</pre>
