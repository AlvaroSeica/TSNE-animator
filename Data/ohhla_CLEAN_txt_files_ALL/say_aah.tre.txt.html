[Intro - Trey Songz - talking]
Aye, when I give you these keys homeboy, don't move my car man
I'm right in the front, ya dig?
Don't move my shit man!
Ho! Ho baby, what's your name?

[Chorus - Trey Songz] - w/ ad libs
Go girl, it's your birthday
Open wide, I know your thirsty
Say "aah" (a-aah, a-aah), hey!
Say "aah" (a-aah, a-aah)
And we don't buy no drinks at the bar
We pop champagne 'cause we got that dough
Let me hear ya say "aah" (a-aah, a-aah)
If you want me say say "aah" (a-aah, a-aah)

[Verse 1 - Trey Songz]
Pocket full of money (money)
Club don't jump 'til I walk inside the doorway (doorway), bottles of that Rosé
Smellin like Dolce &amp; Gabbana (yep!)
Shorty you the baddest and to meet you is an honor, little mama
I got a table waitin, what you think about a convo?
And if you like it baby, we could take it to the condo
And if you like the condo
We could move the party to the bedroom, I'm a beat your body like a Congo

[Break - Trey Songz]
Since we in the club for now (for now)
Might as well get another round (round)
Noticed ain't nothin in ya cup
So give it here baby, let me fill it up (fill it up)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Trey Songz]
Shorty dance like a video vixen
Said her man be on that bullshit pimpin
Well I retired from the Bull like Pippen
Tryin to get you home and/Homer, would you be Marge Simpson?
Whip out front we can leave like pronto
Maple Leaf dash got you feelin like Toronto
Make ya body rise like you puffin on a joint though
Girl that's only if you want though (you ready?), but

[Break]

[Chorus]

[Fabolous - talking over Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
It's Loso, you might be too drunk to know so

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
I make ya say "aah" just like I'm ya doctor
All I prescribe is cranberry and vodka
Then I'm tryin to kick it, play a little soccer
And bust a couple off - blocka blocka
The Henny in ya system, ya start drunk textin and
Suddenly you miss him or even wanna diss him
Then you call ya girl like "what the hell ya gave me?"
She like don't blame me, you better do like Jamie (nice)
And +Blame It+ on the liquor
He works every time, Patrón you my nigga (haha)
Know it's somebody birthday, well where ya ass at? (where ya at?)
And I know ya thirsty but don't know where ya glass at

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro - Fabolous - talking over Chorus]
Say aah, nice
Say aah, say aah
Say aah, say aah
Okay baby
Yeah, that's how you do it girl
Just tilt ya head back, right?
Open wide, aah
There you go
uh uh, no hands baby
Hahaha, it just makes it easier, haha</pre>
