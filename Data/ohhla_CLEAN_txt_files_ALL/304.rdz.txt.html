[Chorus]
I need a bad bitch, a bad bitch
I need a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Lookin for a 3-0-4
I need a bad bitch, a bad bitch
I need a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Lookin through your area code

[Javi Picasso]
My genie in a bottle, don't wanna see me no jato
Off some weed and solcado, I'm a mollow ass mexicano
Thug solda, need a bad bitch that'd roll my doja
Got so many hoes if the po' found out, he'll make me a mormon Jahova
Tell your hoe to bend over, imagine that 
I'ma show her where the real thug passion at
Give her extacy, I'll be bashin that
I wanna know where them bad ass bitches is at
Cash, money and cars, sex under the stars
With a supermodel chick in my arms
Marita, in a tight fa-vita
Yeah Javi wanna meet ya

[Merciless]
Merciless need a nasty hoe, a nasty bitch
Type of chick that won't ask me shit
She like, ai-chi-wa-wa, ooh-la-la
She riding her girl for m√©nage tois
See, they pop pills while I smoke the dub
Sweet bang thug love in the middle of a club
After that, I'm still looking for mo'
I need a bitch, I need a hoe, I need a 3-0-4

[Chorus]

[Merciless]
Girl, squeeze your titties and scream my name
What you don't know, game recognize game
Rubbing on my tattoos, and freed my love
You fucking with a loced out, crazy thug
Can't fight the feeling on extacy
That's why the Mac God keep blessing me
Now I'm down south getting crunk at shows
Might be from Cali, but she got so throwed
I need a bad bitch that's down tonight
No plummer, but I do lay pipe
No biter, but can I have a bite
Shit, in other words I'll fuck you right
I'll serve you long dick, big brown dick
Type of chick that you could get down wit
A white bitch, brown bitch, you a black bitch
I don't care, long as she a bad bitch

[Chorus]

[Rasheed]
I'ma pull up in a all black Range
Purple flame, watch the paint change
Foud two looking strange, and got in the Range
I put a bullet in your brain, when I'm moving the caine
Man, your chick is on my nuts
I don't got time, put on the cuffs
Put the tongue on my nuts, put the thong in her butt
Bust alarm got the guts, I was gone had to raise up
Break up to the make up, fuck that 
When I wake up, got a cock I got to bake up
Raise it up, while I blaze it up
The funky stuff, from the caddy pick-up, yup
She wanna live lavishly, thinking that she having me 
She can define the laws of gravity
I'm gonna bust one deep in a cavity

[Low-G]
Mamacita sabes que en tringo
Mo' viento, pata to a quethro
From tu querida, me wanna to a quera
Forgive me amore, but es be my beta
Madi madi sabes get the quero
Forgive me amore, but es see the cero
Soy tures thinking of the dinero
Soy tures thinking of the dinero
El mero mero porno
Cilo como en the cheddo
I need a fine freak, who can roll my cigarello
Yo got a mello, sucking dick up, by the bello
Blue in lorego, en camente como en prego
