(Time)
max planc was a flipping genius
I know some painters that wanted to sleep with him

black body, physicist
his friend made movies that started riots in France
he kind of looked like Frankenstein
imagine it me crucified with a shovel
oh electric pharaoh, I know you dream of snow
golf cart, ez-go, cigarette smoke, coffee steam
vases, windows ha and coke bottle figures
inanimate objects talking, pajama fire
locusts on your windshield
the rain'll wash it off
a ship can wreck in a drop of my blood
my heart can't break it pumps like a muscle
mona lisa wants outta the louvre
she wants to be the tramp who sleeps in the doorway of houses
I see time, hes got a pencil and a pen for a leg
and his mustache tells the time
band aids with dorito stains
the sun is a blazing lollipop
hallucinations, mc Escher on my muscles
I walk into a room, no one says anything they just smile
I'ma pig bladder punching bag watch the spit splatter
my lips are a hammock
here's his friend he sees giraffe's on fire
his moustache was like a tv antenna
he said there is nothing more charming in the world then
censorship
geniuses believe in magic
and don't ever want to die
he's dreaming of Venus
shes on a 36 ft bed
now he's on fire in his egg built palace
living still life knife
his friend said
I wanted to destroy humanity but it didnt need help

(AC)
you see planc's theory agreed with experiments
of the entire electro magnetic spectrum
unlike classical wave theory
science and god have already met, I met science yesterday

(Time)
what will you say to god
he can't be spoken to he can't be spoken to</pre>
