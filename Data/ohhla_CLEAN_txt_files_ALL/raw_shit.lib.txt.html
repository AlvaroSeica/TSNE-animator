[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
Now everybody, just gather around
Cause all we want to do is, just get on down
You like my sound, bro
I know you do too, on the down low
I'm fuckin' with you

Here we go

[Verse 1: J Dilla]
It's j.a.y l.I.b killa dog hold tha track
Hold tha backs like ya backs amongst the raps
Hold tha mac
(so, what's your roll in this music)
I have the same questions
I'm just trying to create new composition
In debate, the reinnastate, a paperweight
To rennovate, techniplate, and immigrate
And playahate, lay your face, we keep it live
When we roll, cause we call, comming in, stereo
On the phone, get the ho, everywhere we go
And if not, nigga please on your mom
Trigger squeeze, under these,
While I fuck up one of these,
Like, no dose, coke up in ya nose
Some weed up in ya lungs,
The heroin in your vains
You know, sober just by saying the name
It's all up in, all up in this game
So, what up ma comming with me
It's the j.a.y l.I.b

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
Now everybody let's gather around
Cause all we want to do is, just get on down now
I like the sound, bro
I know you do too, cause on the down low
I'm fuckin' with you

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
From the front to tha back
People jump to tha track
Cause they pumpin' like crack
Cause it's funk in the back
Cause the trunk gettin' track
Jump off, run back
Come back, cause they like that raw shit
They want that, jump back when I kiss myself
And jay's crown, got to lay down
It's not the same sound, it's not the playground
We hot, to spray around, shot the plane down
Got the place around, you held hostage,
Two is get down shit, J.D, Madlib,
Who I get down with, sounds figger then cheap
Rockin' the brown, nigga, put it down,
When I get around, my advertary is crown

[Chorus: Talib Kweli]
Now everybody, let's gather around
Cause all we want to do is, just get on down
I like the sound, bro
I know you do too, cause on the down low
I'm fuckin' with you
