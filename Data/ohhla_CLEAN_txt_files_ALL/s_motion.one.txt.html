[Fingazz]
"Fi-fi-fi-Fingazz on the track..."

Hook 1: Mr. Lil' One {Mr. Lil' One *slowed down*}
I'm in the club {I'm in the club}
Sippin' potion {Sippin' potion}
Now I'm in slow {I'm in slow}
Motion, motion, motion {Motion...}

Pre-Chorus: Fingazz
I just can't believe it
It feels like an hourglass
Hey, oh
This girl got me fallin'
Like sand in hourglass
Gotta make it last, make it last

Chorus: Fingazz {Fingazz *slowed down*}
But she go slow motion
On the floor, she movin' it
For me
Slow motion
It feel like, feel like
She really goin' (Slow motion)
She movin' it (Slow motion)
She movin' it
Movin' it {Slow}

[Verse 1: Mr. Lil' One]
"Oooh," said boy, baby girl, come on over here
We can come back and do this every year
Slowly, surely, baby, come and hold me
Hourglass shape, and I love it if you show me
Chill by the sand, go half on a baby
Keep it one hundred, and never get shady
An hour went by, then another went by
Sin look at my face and, I don't know why
And it seems like time wanna stop for you
And we do it all, baby, how you want me to
We can do it anytime, anywhere, any place
Everybody else here, that'll make you feel safe
And my, oh, my, little mama so fly
Like Bonnie and Clyde, baby girl, let's ride

Refrain: Mr. Lil' One {Mr. Lil' One *slowed down*}
Now come on...
Don't make a sound
Come on...
Just slow it {down}

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Mr. Lil' One {Mr. Lil' One *slowed down*}]
I saw her from the corner of my eye like, {"Damn!"}
Holla at a player, let me be that {man}
Yo, it started off fast, then it ended up slow
Now tell me where to go, baby go like, "Whoa!"
Pretty little face, baby, walk this way
Never met another that talk this way
So swift and cool and all of that
And if you give me one sec, I'll be part of that
I wanna kick it with ya, baby, come and give it to me
And we can chill by the sea, on ecstacy
And nobody else, just chill with me
And we can keep it right here like it's supposed to be

Repeat Refrain

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook 1

Hook 2: Mr. Lil' One {Mr. Lil' One *slowed down*}
Make this moment last forever
Forever
Forever
She can work it fast, but slow is better
{Slow is better, slow is better}
Make this moment last forever
Forever
Forever
She can work it fast, but slow is better
{Slow is better, slow is better, slow is better}

Repeat Pre-Chorus

[Fingazz]
But she go slow motion
On the floor, she movin' it
For me
Slow motion
It feel like, feel like
She really goin' (Slow motion)
She movin' it (Slow motion)
She movin' it (Slow motion)
Hey, hey, hey, oh (Oh...)</pre>
