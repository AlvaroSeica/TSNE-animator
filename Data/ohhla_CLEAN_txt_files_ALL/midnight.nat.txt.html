(Esham)
12 in the mornin, woke up with the shakes
Serial killa, Mr. Frosted Flakes
My hands were all bloody and I don't know why
I'm thinkin bout my bitch and why she had to die
Some niggaz out to get me said she settin me up
They pulled out they pistols started wettin me up
I seen my life pass before my eyes in a flash
I drew down my weapon and I started to blast
My bitch caught a slug in the back of the neck
I emptied out the tech and niggaz hit the deck
I ran for the beamer it was sittin in front
I left my bitch's body smokin like a philly blunt
And it was

(CHORUS)
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour, it all happened
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour, they started cappin

I'm bleedin like a motherfucker grabbin my chest
My heartbeat racin like a EMS
I called my partner up on the portable phone
I blew my bitch brains out with the chrome
My nigga said he'd meet me at the Omni hotel
Court date was today and he just jumped bail
Police out to get him, he was under arrest
Bitch warrant for my nigga with the mental stress
Met my nigga at the spot and he had nothin to say
Metro airport to East L.A.
When we got the city it was drama again
Seen a nigga that we jacked in 89 for 10
And it was

(CHORUS)

The nigga started trippin he was wavin his gun
Pissed off since 89 cause we murdered his son
Straight bullets started flyin every way but in mine
Still bleedin like a pig and I'm pressed for time
I looked up and my nigga caught a slug in his face
Now I'm madder than a motherfucker tryin to embrace
My homie body turned cold, I felt him slippin away
He was just here alive now he dead today
And the nigga who had shot him, he was shot on the floor
So I went to his body and I shot him some more
He looked me dead in the face and said you're going to hell
I spit blood in his face as I started to yell

(CHORUS)(2x)

They started cappin
In the midnight, in the midnight hour</pre>
