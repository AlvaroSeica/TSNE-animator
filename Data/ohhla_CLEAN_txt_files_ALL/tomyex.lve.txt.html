Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
You wanna see me fall off?
Wait on it, that black car got weight on it
And my new bitch got a big ol ass
Feel free to hate on it
Yo new niggas â busted
I G5 and he busted
I'm like oh that's what you doin
I ain't heard you, I'm disgusted
Now how you gon go from a triple OG
To a nigga who'd wish he could get it like me
You shittin on me, you trippin
You still hit me up for that dick when you getting lonely
Now she so sick,
No luggage but fuck it, I'm on a ego trip
Non-violent but Big Will, he got that eagle grip
Bouncers don't know yo name, they call you Rico bitch
Uh, messed up ain't it?
You could never upgrade
Remember when yo home girl met me and she damn near fainted?
Damn a nigga so paid, fuck you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This what I'm a do hoe
I'm a get me a new hoe
And I'm gon hit that pussy
And I ain't gon be worryin bout you hoe

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This what I'm a do nigga
I'm a get me a new nigga
And he gon get this pussy
I bet he hit it better than you nigga

[Chorus]
Middle finger to my ex...
Fuck em!
Middle finger to my ex...
Fuck em! Fuck em!
Turn the lights on

[Verse 2]
Bought that bitch some Hermes, bought that bitch some Gucci
Pull up in the Range, now that bitch up in the hoopty
Had her rockin VVS, Emilio coochy
Carolina Herrera look Perla up on the coochy
Should've seen how she used to do me, had me bustin like a uzzi
Now she lookin goofy, got a new boyfriend feelin like a groupie
Hello! Rockin Moncle, neverwinter home in Montecello
Lookin like Rick Fler courtsided the Knicks game watchin mellow
And when the cameras pass and I'm front row at the Grammys
With my freak hoe with my hands all up in her panties
And they announce who the wnner is
I might be feelin really generous
But I only talk money so you might not understand me, fuck you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This what I'm a do hoe
I'm a get me a new hoe
And I'm gon hit that pussy
And I ain't gon be worryin bout you hoe

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This what I'm a do nigga
I'm a get me a new nigga
And he gon get this pussy
I bet he hit it better than you nigga

[Chorus]
Middle finger to my ex...
Fuck em!
Middle finger to my ex...
Fuck em! Fuck em!
Turn the lights on

[Verse 3]
Okay all my ex's turned into wise
They like why you date that nigga, he's a fuckin lowlife
Claim he got a new girlfriend, she called you a lame
Said she wanna switch teams like LeBron damn James
Nigga you know what it mean but she bust for me
Bet she'd like me, bet she'd buy a CD
Bet she a fan, bet she a stand
Bet she don't feel shit in yo pants
Couldn't fuck no way, couldn't fuck no way
Couldn't get a bitch like OJ
And that's why you ain't getting no play, cut the whole thing off like okay okay okay
You told me just stick around cause you gonna make six figures
Bitch nigga that's no money, I'm on my way to a million
You thought that you was gonna break me down but bitch nigga I'm killin
You tryin to get back right now
I'm like nah I'm chillin

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This what I'm a do hoe
I'm a get me a new hoe
And I'm gon hit that pussy
And I ain't gon be worryin bout you hoe

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This what I'm a do nigga
I'm a get me a new nigga
And he gon get this pussy
I bet he hit it better than you nigga

[Chorus]
Middle finger to my ex...
Fuck em!
Middle finger to my ex...
Fuck em! Fuck em!
