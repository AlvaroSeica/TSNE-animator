Yo KL, hook me up with some of that beats by the pound Kane &amp; Abel

We start tightin up on these niggas like a nigga been doin.

[Magic]
Nigga, we got the whole no limit motherfuckin family representin.
Them niggas Kane &amp; Abel, am I my brothers keeper.
Got that fuckin tank around your fuckin neck nigga, fuckin right.
Nigga.

Chorus
Throw them thangs, don't make me throw them thangs nigga
Throw them thangs, don't make me throw them thangs nigga
Throw them thangs, don't make me throw them thangs nigga
Throw them thangs, don't make me throw them thangs nigga

[Kane &amp; Abel]
My hustle's still sick, set trip, bullets spin niggas flip
Hot slugs hit, that's it, rip that ass like some pump dick
Feel respect from my balls I don't pause for shit
I'm quick to empty my clip and hit the gas bitch
Drive by, four niggas thinkin like they the shit
Bye bye, Mr. Kane bring the pain like project brings to the brain
My game is worth more then my weight in cocain
Don't wanna get wet, but bitch don't go outside in the rain
No Limit, we get respect for chin chacks and teks
Mob connects, tryin to disrespect, save your breath
Cause I aint met a motherfucker who can do that yet
On the edge of death like we the last real niggas left

[Magic]
Chorus
(My turn now)

Respect my mind I'm ready to war with any nigga
Face me head up I gotta do that the hard nigga
You don't know where drama come from cause I'm with Kane &amp; Abel
Twin motherfuckers that's definately willing and able
Picture the pain we puttin these niggas through
We got bitches hurtin too, we runnin through the whole fuckin crew
I thought yall knew, for any nigga that wanna buck up
Get fucked up, I gotta fortyfive motherfucker

Chorus 

[Kane &amp; Abel]
I split em, I hit em, then casket fit em
Left a nigga staggerin like Roy Jones done hit em
When I cock my shit I'm a bust my shit
Scary niggas in your click aint prepare for this
Double eye slugs and twelve gauge think this
Hit em with the AP 9 or the M 1 6
See niggas so scared casaulties of wars
Hoes flippin through the air like Domonique Dawes
Give me mine plus yours, strip down to the droors
Give me that crome four four, I'm bout to pull a kickdoe

[Magic]
Chorus x2

[Kane &amp; Abel]
This is Kane &amp; Abel and Mr. Magic nigga.
This aint no motherfuckin heckyl and jeckyl.
Motherfuckers tryin to keep it real nigga.
Make a million in this shit.
They tryin to kill other niggas but guess what.
Nigga run up, niggas gonna get more holes then a golf course bitch.
Niggas down south we bout it bitch.
We dont play no games nigga, aint no talkin.
Don't make me throw them thangs.</pre>
