Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
This rap shit ain't what it used to be
All these fake ass rappers
Talkin' that jewelry
Never talkin' no unity
Cops they keep accusing me
My enemies is still gettin' shot up in my community
What happened to the music for the young
Sellin' drugs, smokin' blunts
My mother struggles every month
My lil homies introduced to the gang
Tattoos on their face
Got a tool on the waist
Nobody to teach 'em
What's right from wrong
My homie got out of prison
He struggles to find a job
He keeps searching for god
And he's fighting with baby's mom
She's like pay the fucking rent
Like the man that you are
And they've been fightin'
So now she kicked him out
He put his clothes in the back
He gotta figure this out
He gotta hustle now
He gotta struggle now
He's fucking up now
He's doing drugs now

[Chorus]
I can't relate
To the shit you say
Fuck you fancy rappers
I ain't fucking with yo mixtapes
You can't relate to the shit I say
How the fuck
When its the realest shit on mixtapes

[Bridge]
You ain't real like you used to be
Your girl ain't real like she used to be
Your boys ain't real like they used to be
Everything will change for the better
Homie including me

[Verse 2]
All you wanna do
Is fit in the crowd
Thats why you talk about
Gettin' bitches and smokin' that loud
Let me guess growing up
Your mother bought you jordans
I couldn't rap about that shit
Cause mine couldn't afford it
My mind recorded images of women
With babies aborted
Your parents won't support it
Baby daddy ignored it
Don't lose faith
Cause every man ain't like that
Txt me that you pregnant
I would write you right back
Look baby don't worry
Our future's looking blurry
I'm riding with you
When I'm far from tryna do you dirty
Cause even if we break up
And it isn't meant to be
Just know your baby daddy
Supported you mentally
Maybe my destiny
Is give you whatever's left of me
Brag to your friends
How i gave you the best memories
And you could choose
To be a part of this real shit
Leaving lil kids behind
Won't be a part of my guilt trip
(oh no)

[Chorus]
