[MC Ren]
I'm the original, one that niggaz be bitin'
But fools wanna meet it, exactly what they did it
I been wreckin' shit 'fore thousand B.C.
Back in the days, nigga on your T.V.
Back when my nigga King TEE was the coolest
When fifteen eighty still had that mack attack
It was just head fool bustin' on the west
I was just like the pinky, now the shit is stinky
The Great Elephant is what they call me around the way
Cause I be stompin' mothafuckers all day
Uhh, king of the jungle, listen to my roar
I be wreckin' shit, keepin' hoochies on the floor
They be gettin' hot, but I don't give a damn
I be caressin' the Mic when I hit jams
thinkin' in mornin' crone 'til I'm throu
Cause I'm gonna make it real funky for you
Uhh, the walkin' black gaint, with the Desert Eagle
But how many niggaz can I fit in my Regal?
Niggaz came lift me in my place I live
Because of all the funky-Ass-Shit that I give
I got hypocrite-Niggaz-Balls hangin' in the back
Now go and think I'm hick, go and make it kind of quick
Cause I'm on a mission and they know I'm comin'
Every time they hear I'm comin' was all fools they start runnin'
Fifty thousand troops lookin' like the middle East
The shit I have to do, just to get a little piece
Cause busters, they wanna be chillin'
With that nigga that be callin' the villain
Can you blame them?
As I direct my boogie ain't water down
My boogie be thumpin' and hittin' fools way across town
Planners be digible, niggaz stay cool
Comin' up with fat shit sittin' on Pharaoh's stool
As I think into my self but I never talked back
As I walk to the shack "to the shack"
Everyday that I'm livin' niggaz be trippin'
Cause all the funky shit that I be givin'
It's like, yeah, I'm still here, still at the game
I'm makin' that funky shit cause ain't nothin' change
Niggaz they wanna know what's up, I'm still chillin'
Yeah, I'm still the Villain, yeah, I'm make the killin'
I carry my big stick, walk down the block
Roll through Compton with my nigga Rocc
It's 'Ren The Mad Scientist bustin' tight-Ass-Raps "why?"
Cause the nigga gotta make snaps
There's too many clowns up on the jew box
Too many itty-bitties occupyin' the Rap City
So I'ma call Don Corleone with bad news
And make niggaz enough of that they can't refuse
So hold your breath whenever I bust a verse
And hold on tight because it gets much worse
I set booby traps where ever that I kick it
But you can't come and kick it cause niggaz might stick it
Ain't no warning down niggaz on these streets
And ain't no warning down rhymes with these beats
A Mad Scientist straight outta C.P.T
That don't give a fuck if he can't M.C.

Yeah, yeah

[Outro: Dr. Khalid Muhammad] 
When they took us from Africa they stripped us 
Off our diamonds and our gold and our silver 
Our material resource, our spiritual resource and our human resource 
And when we came.. here most of the time we didn't have shoes
we went barefoot 
Huh, they stripped the black woman of whatever little tass-brad she had 
Nine months pregnant, tied her up 
Tie horses to one leg, horses to the other leg 
Beat the horses, make them run in oppsite directions 
Until they rip and pull the black woman apart 
And the unborn black baby hauled off her 
And a no good cracker, would bring another black woman on 
Her stomach fuuuull nine months with the fruit of her woooomb 
Take a knife and stick it in her full stomach 
With the roundness of her stomach and rip it open 
And stick in AIDS, Syphilis, Gonorrhea 
Hand inside and snatched the unborn black baby from her 
Threw it to the ground and crushed the baby's head 
with his boot G's 
Make other pregnant black women watch 
So that the adrenaline of fear would cross it's way through her viens 
And stain her brains and touch the unborn life in her 
Hoping that the babies will be booooorn 
afraid of a wicked cruel slave master</pre>
