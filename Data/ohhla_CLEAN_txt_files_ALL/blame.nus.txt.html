(Bridge):
Might as well blame it on (nussie)
who they blame for everything in the city (nussie)
whose homocide's getting real tired of (nussie)
who turned their back on but still be showing love (nussie)
who boiled lobsters and fed the whole hood (nussie)
who hit a lick for some bricks, and it was good (nussie)
who got stacks and still pulled jacks (nussie)
who got the whole baton rouge on his back (nussie)

when them boys got, uh
my name came up
celebrity in my city, but nothing like P Diddy
I always get the blame for everything grime and gritty
DCF's the truth, some scared so they spooked
(), you aint sharing, get the fuck
and for little bitty bucks, I'll smash your ass with my truck
I'm the judge and the jury for all these (new)
call me king sneak attack, or mr. really be doing them things
black gloves, no mask, white bronco (straight O.G.)
butcher knife, what does nussie need a gun for?
i'll cut all the freckles out your face
then buck shot them back, spray (speckles on your face)
last lane that I, uh
no body saw that
I wore a J.R. Ewing Stetson cowboy hat
I screamed yeehah, then galloped down the road
no body really saw me, but every body knows (nussie)

Might as well blame it on (nussie)
who they blame for everything in the city (nussie)
who's homocides getting real tired of (nussie)
who turned their back on but still be showing love (nussie)
who boiled lobsters and fed the whole hood (nussie)
who hit a lick for some bricks, and it was good (nussie)
who got stacks and still pulled jacks (nussie)
who got the whole baton rouge on his back (nussie)

you can take it as a joke, but I'll rob you with a note
and some say that was me, on channel 33 (don't tell nobody)
my street credit's awesome, it is what it is
and these pussy cats flossing, it's time to split wigs
I made you all's day, when I wrote the 'Dumway'
because me and skull say what you all be wanting to say
aint no competition, no choice but to listen
word on the street niggas feeling what I'm spitting
they know I really live it
they know I'm about my business
If it breathes and it bleeds
they know that I will kill it
Fuck a record deal
I'd rather watch cartoons
sip some purple syrup and put some bricks in balloons
that's DCF talk, you can ask Diablo
and Diablo means Devil, in case you didn't know
and here's something else, I think you should know,
touch one hair on my head, I'll kill your ass dead

Might as well blame it on (nussie)
who they blame for everything in the city (nussie)
whose homocide's getting real tired of (nussie)
who turned their back on but still be showing love (nussie)
who boiled lobsters and fed the whole hood (nussie)
who hit a lick for some bricks, and it was good (nussie)
who got stacks and still pulled jacks (nussie)
who got the whole baton rouge on his back (nussie)

It's like this here man
you can know I did, but you can't do shit about it
so bitch, deal with it (hahahaha)
looks like, sounds like, smells like your mom (haha)
bitch play with me, I'll make you shit in ()
in and out of jail, still causing hell
i live by a code, no such thing as 'Imma tell'
all eyes on me, let a real nigga (?roll?)
why can't every body eat, in these baton rouge streets?
The DJ's the one who put this bitch on the map
and I'm the one making every body respect that
(), so you know what it is
It's time to bless my hood, because it() where I live
and don't be blaming me for everything that's going wrong
it's one of the fucking reasons I wrote this fucking song
wise man once said, 'you want to blow stack your yao'
Nah, that was bar joe, blowing purple indo

Might as well blame it on (nussie)
who they blame for everything in the city (nussie)
who's homocides getting real tired of (nussie)
who turned their back on but still be showing love (nussie)
who boiled lobsters and fed the whole hood (nussie)
who hit a lick for some bricks, and it was good (nussie)
who got stacks and still pulled jacks (nussie)
who got the whole baton rouge on his back (nussie)</pre>
