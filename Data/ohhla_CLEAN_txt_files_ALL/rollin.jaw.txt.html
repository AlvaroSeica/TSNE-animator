Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Wow, Christy, do you see that truck?
I mean gross, that is so taky
That must be one of those rednecks I've heard about!

Hop in the truck
Come on lets roll
Just bought a case of beer
Now we headin for a mud whole
County boys and we do it right
Got the bill of my hat pointed strait to the sky
Carhartt and wranglers on
Bass pro hat, camoflauge on my phone
Got the browning decal on the back
Right next to a G
What you know about that!

I'm country and that's how we live
If ya got moonshine then I'm takin a sip
Some folks call me a redneck
I smile and take it as a compliment
I live life the only way I know how
Walk with a swag and I rep the south
And if you see me as I'm riding through the crowd
I'm hanging out the window screamin it loud!

[Chorus]
Yeah buddy
Rollin like a redneck
Trucks jacked up I got a smoke stack
Nuts hanging off te hitch
And a system in the back that'll make your nose itch
Yeah I'm living that right [repeat]
And I'm ridin that tight [repeat]
Son I'm riding so tight that my tires sound like a damn bull dog fight
Yea my tires sound like a damn bull dog fight!

Wakein people as I ride through at night
And don't forget about the skyjacker lift kit
How you think I made them 44's fit
Don't ya know we ain't playin around
Six twelves in the back helpin out with the sound
And I got a train horn if your to slow
Speed up or I'm lettin it blow
If your ridin to close from behind
I got spotlights thatll turn ya blind
So back off you don't want none
Hanging on the back glass ain't a BB gun food
Whod you think you were messin with [repeat]
These country boys they ain't nomyth
And if you see me as I'm riding through the crowd
I'm hangin out the window screamin it loud!

[Repeat Chorus]

Ok, we bout to rap it up
You know that we country
And that we tough
You know that we hunt
Ya know that we fish
You know when we see a buck we don't miss
Ya know that we love to play in the mud
And when we get trucks we jack em up
And when we get stuck we don't get mad
We drop the tailgate and have a party in the back
That's right
We live so tight, open the cooler and grab your budlight
I'm talkin to err damn body
Meet me at the mudhole 5 o'clock Friday
If you down to have you a good time
You better show up fool I ain't lyin
And if you see me as I'm ridin through the crowd
I'm hangin out the window screamin it loud!

[Repeat Chorus]

Uhmm, excuse me
Can I ride in your truck?</pre>
