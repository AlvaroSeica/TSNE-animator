[Mr. Sancho speaking]
Yeah, this song right here
Is dedicated to my lost love
It took me along time, to gather my thoughts
And tell you how I feel
But all I can say is...I love you...and I miss you

[Verse 1]
You were just a friend of me
Love they way you brought out the best of me
We drove another, talked about it, we were meant to be
Baby do you feel the same just don't feel ashamed
I know, I found the cold and lonely you'll erase my pain
I understand you already got a man
Gotta tell you how I feel in case my life comes to an end
But I'm still here for you, real for you
I think that I would pack the steel for you, kill for you
Your all I need, so if you really wanna try
Follow your feelings they don't lie
Now dry your eyes and please don't cry
Our friendship won't be jeopardized
Would you do the same for me
Take the blame for me
Baby girl you know that I will never change for me
You know I tell you what I'm made of, tell you straight up
What my feelings for you are really made of

[Chorus]
Me and you...we were meant to be
Together...Together...for all eternity
Me and you...we were meant to be
Together...Together...for all eternity

[Verse 2]
So baby tell me what you think
Yeah, I know...that you need some time to think
And did I catch you by surprise
I think I need to tell you how I feel inside
But baby just remember this
We gave each other our very first kiss
We learned about "the birds and the bees" together
Made a promise to be friends forever
And I don't want all that to change
And that you know how just I feel
I just don't want things to get strange
Cause I am here for you, real for ya
You know that I'll still shed a tear for ya, real for ya
Your all I need, so if you really wanna try
Follow your feelings they don't lie
Now dry your eyes and please don't cry
Our friendship won't be jeopardized

[Chorus]

[Mr. Sancho speaking]
This songs dedicated...to you Diana
I lost you a couple of years ago
And I never got a chance to tell you how I feel
So I made this song for you
And I want you to know
That I love you...and I'll always miss you

[Chorus]
