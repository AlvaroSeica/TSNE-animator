One, two
One, two, three, four, ohh, yeah, yeah

This here ain't no love song and it ain't for you
It's for the folks who relate to what I've been going through
It's for the forty hour overtimer working man
And to the good women out there, I know you'll understand

Why don't you run off to L.A. and lose your mind
Get some energy doctor to tell you everything is fine
We can still be friends like you talk about
But first give me back them pearls and the keys to my fuckin' house, get out

They say all we need is just a little patience
But what do you do when your woman is too high maintenance, yeah
I'm hatin' to admit it even if it's your wife
Tell her pack your shit and take the first train out of my life, oh yeah

It's a classic line, baby I just wanna be friends
But baby my friends don't have keys to my Mercedes Benz, no
I think I know what you mean, you wanna talk and such
Tell me all your problems, but we don't fuck, ain't that right

I had plenty of friends fore I met you, I don't need no more
So now I think it's time you started heading out for the door
And even though I feel real bad tonight
Please pack your shit and take the first train out of my life, oh, yeah

They say all we need is just a little patience, yeah
But what do you do when your woman is too high maintenance, I know
I'm hatin' to admit it even if it's your wife
Tell her pack your bags and take the first train out of my life
Ohh, ohh

Why don't you run off to L.A. and lose your mind
You got fifteen minutes and I think you're wasting time, yeah
It's easy to see when you've lost your mind
But here I'll be when you decide to come back blind, ooh

You were a midwest girl who say she like to drink beer and hang
And now you're walkin' red carpets talkin' New York hip-hop slang
And even though I might break down and cry tonight
Please pack your shit and take the first train out of my life, oh, yeah, yeah

Why don't you run off to L.A., why don't you run off to L.A.
Why don't you run off to L.A., why don't you run off to L.A.
Why don't you run off to L.A., why don't you run off to L.A.
Why don't you run off to L.A., why don't you run off to L.A.
Why don't you run off to L.A., why don't you run off to L.A.</pre>
