Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You play the field like a tractor
Scope for greener pastures
But you never have scored what you've never asked for
Met someone who made me glow
Passion was like crazy wo
Doted on another though, so of course I let her go

Oh no! my gentle recipes
Overloaded with Fenella leather-mine
If it keeps on this directemy
F*#* it thats gonna mean Vasectomy
And were the livin poor, set the table get the door
Wrestle naked hit the floor
But I don't seek that shit no more
Its different for me, try to tell myself a different story
This alpha male we count the tale "bullshit" can just destroy me
Cause what we say is what we seek,
What we seek is what we get
What we get is what we give
I can give you nothing less

"EXCEPT"

"INFATUATION", take these words and turn them into lies
"INFATUATION", turns the earth to fool that does not hear
"I I I I I I INFATUATION", say she ain't, my every last desire
"INFATUATION", is "just" the thing I want or the thing I need

He collects clips from magazines, found them full of hollow point
Mixes mehdia with the media they both consume the young.
The same old song gets sung, He wants to hang so he gets hung
He's chase'n father figures a real son of a gun
I don't copy to the coffini's
Carter quite don't make bail
Um'teen years for moving keys
Ironic he's locked up in jail
Outside he is idolized, my sister class and asked them boy'z they wanna be just like'em
Push more rocks then belts of asteroids
Better strapped the paranoid then, in the streets without a choice, to, peace of mind has been destroyed
But now you got a louder voice
Idols lie to idle minds that, I don't mind if got mine
If all are lies idealized then all our crimes are idolized, then

"INFATUATION", take these words and turn them into lies
"INFATUATION", turns the earth to fool that does not hear
"I I I I I I Infatuation", say she aint, my every last desire
"INFATUATION", is "just" the thing I want or the thing I need

If this isn't love
Why does my heart hurt so baaaaaaaaaaaaad

You don't know why
You wanna be the man
You wanna be demanded by other people's hands
So how
you caught up in the tree's with the audience screams at the "Thought"
But you don't know why
You wanna be the man
You wanna be demanded by other people's hands
So how
You caught up in he's knee's
Make the audience please
Like a party in the trees

"INFATUATION", take these words and turn them into lies
"INFATUATION", turns the earth to fool that does not hear
"I I I I I I Infatuation", say she aint, my every last desire
"INFATUATION", is "just" the thing I want or the thing I need

"Now everybody in the club stand still like a rubber-band filled with Government bills"

"Now everybody in the club stand still"</pre>
