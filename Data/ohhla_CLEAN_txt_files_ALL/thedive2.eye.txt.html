And now the voice in your head IS yours

[Eyedea]
Take a deep breath there's nothing to be afraid of
What you just did was fall to the depths of existence
The place the mind keeps you away from by it's own process
of building models for understanding
This is not insanity, this is in fact the ultimate reality
The union you've acheived is only possible in thoughts no more
You never fall if you never fight

[background]
You never fall if you never fight

[repeat 2X]
You found yourself falling into madness so you dove
The best thing you ever did was let go

[repeat 2X]
I found myself falling into madness so I dove
The best thing I ever did was let go

[Eyedea]
See life is a play that we are always acting out
without ever seeing it from the writers or audiences point of view
When we reach infinity we become the writer
the actors and the audience at the exact same time

So here you are, and now you understand
You always were here, that's why you always ran
But you can only run away for so long
Before you catch up with yourself and become part of the song
I'd like to welcome you, to the heaven you've created
I tell the truth, this is the wisdom of the ancients
Holding onto something contradicts or being, so fly free {*repeat 4X*}
Maybe I had to go crazy to get where I am
I felt myself slipping away and I let myself fall
Gotta lose your mind before you find it
And when you finally find it you'll find out you never lost it at all
There's a natural flow, that's attached to the soul
It don't ask you to go, it just gradually pulls
It's always now and your never not you
So follow yourself because if nothing else your existence is true

[Chorus]
have you ever felt yourself slipping away? I am, I mean, I was slipping away
but no matter what I am I'm me, and I know me so I'm ok
have you ever felt yourself slipping away? you are, I mean, you were, slipping away
but no matter what you are you you, and you know you so your ok

[Eyedea]
I'm not a poet or a communist, a comet or a star
You're not a genius or a prophet, you just are
I'm not insane cause I have no need for my sanity
It's just another chain that keeps me from reality
Reality is mine to play with and mold
the best thing I ever did was let go
So let go of the models transend the physical mind
and peacefully become part of the whole
The walls came tumbling down, but this town it was for creeps
I've been runnin around, lookin for my feet
And now a part of the ground, and if the ground complete
Live in the now and forever be at peace
Live in the now don't stray away from the cycle
I'm  one with the universe, one with the life flow
When you know that that which is below is above
the fear you once had will become love (feel the love)

[Chorus]

[Eyedea]
It starts out with a question. how much of it is real?
Now all is irrelevant, outside of this ordeal
Don't worry about explainin it there ain't no human language
that can actually describe exactly how you feel
Now I see clear, through external distractions
Piece by piece it comes together, so I laugh and I smile
In the beginning it was deranged
But I guess all things come to pass, after awhile
If madness could have a picture face how would it look?
like step one to becoming the contents of your own book?
Right where you are right now is where your gonna stay
And as long as you're always moving with yourself you'll, never slip away</pre>
