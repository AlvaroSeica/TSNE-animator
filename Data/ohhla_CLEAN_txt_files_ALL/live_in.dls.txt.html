Yo yo~! Aight y'all, we got a little treat for y'all
A treat for the kiddies
Here's an oldie but goodie
This is a live recording of us doing "Buddy"
This is from 1996 from Tokyo
It was us, S.D.P., Kahn was on deck
So um, just check it out, check it out y'know
Gonna give you a little treat to eat, aight?

[the other rappers cover Run-D.M.C.'s "Sucker MC's"]
Took a test to become an MC
And Orange Krush became amazed at me
And Larry put me inside, his Cad-illac
The chaffeur drove off and he never came back
Mase cut the record down to the bone
And now we're makin deals on my telephone
And we're talkin this and that, a bit, a bat
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath
But see ahh, that's the life, ah that I lead
And you sucker MC's on the T-I-P
Sucker whack, move back, catch a heart attack
Because there's nothin in the world, the party ever lack
I cold chill at a party in a b-boy stance
Rock on the mic, I make the girls wanna dance
Fly like a Dove, that come from up above
I'm rockin on the mic and you can call me Lovey Love

Aight y'all, we just wanted to keep it movin
We want to make sure y'all havin a good time out here tonight
(Word up! Word up!) That song is about
(Word up! Word up!) havin a fuckin good time out here y'all
(Word up! Word up!) So we gonna do it like this
From the back to the front, be a slave to the middle
There is no code{?} to this, that's the way it's gotta be Chris
Check it out y'all
For my people over here (c'mon!)
My people over there (I said c'mon!)
Party people in the front (I SAID C'MON!)
What, what, what?
Posdonus! Trugoy
P.A. Mase (word up) enjoy!
Feel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat
This is De La Soul, it got a new heartbeat
It go, uhh

[De La Soul's Dove breaks into "Buddy"]
A meany, meany, meany, meany (say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany (say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean
Meany, meany, meany, meany (say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany (say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean
(What what wha-what what?)
Hello it's the soul
Troopin in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's the knockouts out there 
Who's holdin my buddy - hold up, wait a minute!

[Pos]
Now just wait (just wait)
We're gonna talk about Buddy on the stage (on the stage)
But before we let open up the full gaze
Make sure the numbers are straight out
the Soul, the Soul, the Soul, the Soul

[De La raps the Jungle Brothers verses]
We got ahh, De La Soul from the soul
Black medallions (and) no gold
Hangin out wit Mase (who?) hangin out with Kahn (who?)
Check it out now we got the shit goin in
For the lap, Jimbrowski must wear a cap (cap)
Just in case the young girl likes to clap (clap)
Ain't for the win but for now
I want my man Kahn to say a lil' somethin
Aiyyo Kahn bust it!

[Kahn raps in Japanese - very tough to discern live]

[Kahn finishes in English]
What? C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
Shit if you love to rock
Let me hear you say YEAHHHHH
Say YEAHHHHH
Say YEAHHHHH
Say De La Soul! (De La Soul)
Say emcee Kahn! (Emcee Kahn!)
Say S.D.P. (S.D.P.)
Uhh, c'mon, c'mon, yeah

[S.D.P. raps in Japanese - send if you know the verse]

[De La Soul jumps back in]
Check it out y'all, wha-what, wha-what, wha-what
Yo; now when the Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
When you at the club, our ritual unfolds
Grabbin of the bones, swingin of the hair
(And then Jenny start flockin it everywhere)
Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
And all the fellas in the place c'mon, lemme hear you say
Yeahhhh (yeahhhhh)
Say hell yeah! (Hell yeah!)
Say yeahhhhh (yeahhhhh)
Say oh yeah~! (Oh yeah~!)
Peace and love, S.D.P. and Kahn
