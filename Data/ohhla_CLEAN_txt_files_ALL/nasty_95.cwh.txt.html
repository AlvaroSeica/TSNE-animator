[*Everybody shouting*]
Kill a motherfuckin' hoe, kill a motherfuckin' hoe
Kill a motherfuckin' hoe, kill a motherfuckin' hoe

It's the Mack Freeze I'll flow to any type of rhythm
Bring me all ya bitches and I just might screw 'em
Me no have no morals when it comes to hoes
Or any other bitches that ever got told
So these hoes gotta learn it out way
And these niggas y'all just can't fade
Now I'm wrapped up in this Cold World shit
Creepin' on these bitches and tryna get rich
2-9-2 is the code for the click
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THEN YOU PROBABLY A BITCH!
HEEEEEYYYYYYY!!!!!

Kill a motherfuckin' hoe, kill a motherfuckin' hoe
Kill a motherfuckin' hoe, kill a motherfuckin' hoe
Kill a motherfuckin' hoe, kill a motherfuckin' hoe
(shout until fade)</pre>
