Song:   Know You Rider
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Well I know your rider
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well I know your rider
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby rolling in your arms

Well I laid down last night but I could not take my rest
Well I laid down last night but I could not take my rest
Cuz my mind was wanderin like them wild geese in the west

Lord I wish I was a headlight on a north bound train
Lord I wish I was a headlight on a north bound train
Gonna shine my light on the cool Colorado rain

Well I know your rider
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well I know your rider
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby rolling in your arms

Lord the sun gonna shine down on that door someday
Lord the sun gonna shine down on that door someday
That old north wind gonna blow my blues away

Well I know your rider
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well I know your rider
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby rolling in your arms
Gonna miss your baby rolling in your arms</pre>
