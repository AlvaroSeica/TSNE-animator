[Tech N9ne]
Come on my music make her snake away
my music make her creep away
my music make her sneak away
every single day

The club scene is filled wit cats who mug mean
my thug team is Skatterman and Snug Brim
Krizz and Grant and Kutty be my buddies wit slug beams.
Joe and Nick and catty Matty open your bloodstreams.
Snake ya make ya broad disrespect ya breaka breaka One N9ne
grace to face wit pace ya hates the way I make raps erase ya
hearts on brace so he takes echinecea
I ain't come to talk about you and your girl man
if I tell him what I know he'll do the earl thing
It's a pity
how your living in your city
and your kitty is kicking wit me
getting grimy and gritty
aight klown I know how this might sound
I heard your womans peeping I'm coming wit tight klowns
we can fight now
or else you can just pipe down
why am I even talking to you right now

[Chorus]
I don't know what who she creep wit no
I don't know who else she sleeps wit no
All I know you don't want no beef wit
Strange will make ya dame change and snake ya man

[Krizz Kaliko]
He wit this chick for like 2 or 3 years
she in the club getting lose of like 2 or 3 beers ya know
he done shared 2 or 3 tears before
now here we go again
tell you be throwing and mowing and ?
mumbling something bout last night
wat was this cat like
wanna live the fast life
make the choice let it go you can back it up
and if you wanna get back wit her maybe you can patch it up
She chose me to approach me to slowly
poke the back out of her rode the pony and saddled her
told me it didn't matter if she was unhappy she had a habit
and was an addict and had to have it
now her boyfriends on to us
and he got beef wit me
I ain't tripping got my piece wit me
out numbered got my peeps wit me
it's Rice Kutt Tech Skatter Snug and BG so well see.

[Chorus]

[Tech N9ne]
Its official grab your pistol
she told him how we make the municipal
licking crystal wit mystical
how I hit it was critical then I split then I missed a few rounds
tech and christen you down
you fished and you found y
ou still insist to be clowned
cause here I stand the ? in town and dissing you now
I spit till you frown cause you a trick and I'm bound
to tell your chick to make me rich you swim in shit and you drown
I have now time for the punks I dump
not eager to stick around waiting for funk to jump
hes mad at the N9ne cause I put the crunk in the front
you big as Sherman Klump
how many lumps do you want
still I don't really know who you talking bout
if you don't get out my face you wont be walking out
but in my mind I remember I sats it down and ate it soft
cause I laugh when I told her wretch around and wrench it off cha

Yo see you all in my face I'm like what
I see you all in my space I'm like what
I don't know your girlfriend you heard me say
so I don't know the girl then

Yo see you all in my face I'm like what
I see you all in my space I'm like what
I don't know your girlfriend you heard me say
so I don't know the girl then</pre>
