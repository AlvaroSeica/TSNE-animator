[Intro]
Alot Of these niggas aint ready ta be no gangsta So my word of advice to yall niggas
chill out

[1st Verse]
Nobody hate me cause they love me
They know I'm thuggin I aint backin down from nothin I aint stuntin (patna)
I'm from a real street whid real heat called Gstreet
cross the trap we 50 deep how the thugs greet
Bein niggas from fat skinny ta thin niggas
chill out for you be up in that jail house mamas aint bring us up to be no gangstas
the hood got us all with anger hood got us all in danger
Niggas throwed on every coner bottle after bottle
another kidney gettin weak,from every swallow
Thought he was gone kill one when he bust that choppa
He let it off and killed wohty
and all his patnas
Now he locked up in a 6 man cell (Gettin Fucked)
When he touch down he a straight up gal
Wan be a husla aint even got no street since
You dont deserve it anyway
Aint from that durty anyway

[Chorus]
Its to late to be the dope man(Chill Out)
Hoes Love You Till You Broke Man (Chill Out)
