Nah I'm sayin'?
Everything's water
My neck flooded with water
My wrist full of water
Even my house is on the water

Come up to holla
I'm a show ya how to ball out
Gimme the dice
I'm a show ya how to ball out
Go to the bar
I'm a show ya how to ball out
That's 'em
I'm a show ya how to...
I'm a show ya how to ball out
Really go all out
Stop by twenty-fifth
And rock all the stores out
Fly through the burrow
And Coup with the doors out
Mad, yo, let ? put the walls out
Me and my penpals spend like ten thou
Every month buyin' bottles and enchous
At the crib me in love with ten gals
Got time like they fuckin' with ten trials
B to the Beezy
Life in the fast lane
Don't know your first and I don't know your last name
Find a ... in designer clothes
It's about to go down like dominoes

Hey, it's okay
We can ride on the escalade
Pick you up around ???
Where we headin', headin' to the club
Hey, it's okay
We can ride on the escalade
Pick you up around ???
Where we headin', headin' to the club

I'm a show you how to make this
Live like The Matrix
Don't cop a great six
Bing like a spaceship
No local only got the same chicks
Shit on me, make a nigga eight licks
Westside highway headed to envy
Quarter past twelve and I just lapped Jimmy
Speed down speaker phone Meka and Mindy
Them models be empty them hoes be friendly
After the party they go to the telly now
Mami says she hungry I'm a go for her belly now
Ask me for paper I tell her no way
She tellin' me I'm a dawg I say it's okay

Hey, it's okay
We can ride on the escalade
Pick you up around ???
Where we headin', headin' to the club
Hey, it's okay
We can ride on the escalade
Pick you up around ???
Where we headin', headin' to the club

Shake it
Go on girl, shake it
Shake it
Go on girl, shake it
Shake it
Go on girl, shake it
Shake it
Go on girl, shake it

Oh, oh, come in the club with a ? toe killer
I'm bout to make fo' real fo' realer
Mo' money, mo' ?, mo' scriller
Lock the game down as the rap go realer
Shit, me and Couta got the six-shooter
We been there, done that, iced out with Frank Miller
Pimp, I'm the future, woman seducer
And I make 'em holla like ??
Three in the morning at Emily's
We goin' up in energies
Friends, I still want my enemies
Jump in, not big by their Bent-e-lies
See me in the hood I'm associatin'
With a burner in ya mouth no adosciatin'
Ma carriers it's hilarious, I tell her
You can't be serious
Let's go

Hey, it's okay
We can ride on the escalade
Pick you up around ???
Where we headin', headin' to the club
Hey, it's okay
We can ride on the escalade
Pick you up around ???
Where we headin', headin' to the club

Yo, oh, oh
Oh, oh

Shake it
Go on girl, shake it
Shake it
Go on girl, shake it
Do your thing shake it
Go on girl, shake it
Shake it</pre>
