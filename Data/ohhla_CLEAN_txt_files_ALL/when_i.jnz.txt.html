New lesson
[Let's puff this J]

(CHORUS)
When I close my eyes I see the world and see just who you are
It's hard to walk away but you got ??? let's puff this J
Let's puff this J
Let's puff this J
Let's puff this J
[Ha, ha] Let's puff, OK?

It soothes thee
To be
Movie
Party
Like Hennessey
Scars thee
Bacardi
Emcee with no depth
Leave him swept
Under the rug kept
And check with the tug-of-war
Your sore
'Cause my score is high
'Cause I show I
What is in my eye for vision
I take you on the journey, listen
As we travel, unravel, Rumpelstiltskin
Rollercoast breaking ground
Every word heard in cars, headphones
Javelin, travelin', violin lost in the storm of life [life]
[Uh-hu-hiii]
[That's some new shit] [That's right]

(CHORUS)

You always fall in love with the wrong one
For all the right reasons, attraction ain't dumb
Or smart; fun can be pain
When you became
Nothing's the same
Finding lame answers
To fill void blame has dances
Same backup droids to the same ol' drama
Diploid like meiosis
Psychosis of two worlds that could have became hate
Is bating to the enormous fate of life
Never beyond the gate
Of those who can't translate reality
Needing badly to see
Insecurity is eternity in denial
Aim
Blame
Only creates toilet-tissue barriers
Carriers
To the virus of ignorance
You can't smoke a blunt with us 'cause he's blank
Is that why the ??? ashes shanks
That's why your shit just sank
Motherfuckers never even knew why
Trapped in that thing called stank [And that shit ain't ]
D-d-d-d-dank

[You fuckin' with bammer. You fuckin' with bammer. You fuckin' with bammer.]

(CHORUS X 2) - [On first chorus, no repetition of "Let's puff this J"]

Let's puff this J
Let's puff this J
Let's puff this J
Let's puff, OK?
Let's puff this J
Let's puff this J
Let's puff this J
Let's puff this J

Sometimes you just gotta sit back, you know what I'm sayin'?
Crumble it up, look out the window
maybe light some incense, you know what I'm sayin'?
Get in the mood or maybe you just kickin' it at a bus-stop
know what I'm sayin'?
It's the last Zig-Zag that you tucked away in your wallet
And the bus about to come and you only have, like, you know, three minutes
[Let's puff this J]
Everybody talkin' shit around you, you just wanna get away
You go in the bathroom, you light up endo
Open up the window, start thinking
[Let's puff this J]
All the bills just came, and you can't pay nothin' today
Everything's just messin' with you
Maybe momma callin' you for whatever
People just can't  they won't stop fuckin' with you!
Unplug your damn phone
[Let's puff this J]
Let's do something
Let's just relax, fool
Come on, you gotta relax for a minute
Somethin' to think about
Come on, let's puff this sucker
You can - you can't puff too long, though
You'll burn your fingertips
You'll burn your fingertips</pre>
