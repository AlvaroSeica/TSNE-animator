[Opio]
Peep it, wasn't always on some freak shit
I fell in love once, with this shorty on some weak shit
Op wasn't always on that freak shit
I fell in love once, with this shorty on some weak shit
Feel me, I wasn't always on that freak shit
I fell in love once, with this shorty on some weak shit
Peep it, I wasn't always on that freak shit
I fell in love once, with this shorty on some weak shit

[Opio]
So the world is so cruel, but I was born with a hard head towards the bull
Hella humble, seldom showing my pull
And I'm living in the jungle, so my clip is on full
Now that's a life lesson, like love, god, luck and family
Peep game and ask the right questions, 'stand me?
I was taught to keep a bomb in a pantry
Incase these dirty cops wanna come and harass me
Ask Massey, we tight like Butch Cassidy
And The Sundance Kid, I keep us uncontested, shit
By my side, if she's the one, that's it
From the front to the side, man she's dumb ass thick
And I must admit, I was struck by the physical first
Toke a minute to get into her mentally worth away
Destiny, faith, a pure coincidence put us together
I said to her, hey, we meant for this
She smiled and she kissed my neck
I could walk a hundred miles if you disrespect my queen
Sharp like sunny on a scene
Do the Ray Liotta Goodfella
Blodied up your cream colour polo shirt
Let the fo-fo squirt
Get real ignorant and show no mercy
Percy slams, I'm standing on the edge, but serve me
It's curtains, jealousy got me spinning in circles
For what I was sweat up while I really shoulda let it go
It's not a methaphor, don't put up on the peddle store
You headed for disaster, think I'm lying you can ask her

Op wasn't always on some freak shit
I fell in love once, with this shorty on some shit
Peep it, wasn't always on some freak shit
I fell in love once, with this shorty on some shit
Man I wasn't always on that freak shit
I fell in love once, with this shorty on some shit
Peep it, wasn't always on that freak shit
I fell in love once, with this shorty on some shit</pre>
