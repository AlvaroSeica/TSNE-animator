Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If every day goes like this
How do we survive

If every day goes like this
How do we survive
We're working late on the night shift
To get peace of mind

If every day goes like this
How do we survive
We're working late on the night shift
To get peace of mind

If every day goes like this
How do we survive
We're working late on the night shift
To get peace of mind

If every day goes like this
How do we survive
We're working late on the night shift
To get peace of mind

If every day goes like this
We're working late on the night shift
To get peace of mind

If every day goes like this
How do we survive
We're working late on the night shift
To get peace of mind

If every day goes like this
How do we survive
We're working late on the night shift
To get peace of mind</pre>
