Yo, I plan to build a myself a facility before I'm 40 
a molecular archceogenetic laboratory 
that can analyze complex poetry data for me 
even if it was recorded poorly, how extraordinary 
I frog leap over awful beats 
then I separate rappers by the carbon-14s 
to determine the age of anything ever made 
regardless of how the outside surface has changed 
I put a curse on your name, bombard your brain 
with gamma x-rays till you burst into flames 
with the scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal 
viable style, it's like trying to ride a bull 
let's have a dictionary duel after school 
check into me a nice Cedar Sinai room 
so I can get sick as the flu, spittin the truth 
if you ain't got this album, you missing the proof 
prepare for your doom my nuclear rocket plumes 
glow against the pale background of the moon
toxic fumes spoil complete stocks of fruits, and foods
burning your flammable boxes and booms 
got in the groove even though I'm not in the mood 
motherfucker you didn't win 'cause I can't lose 
give the fans the chance to choose, fuck you 
who's the illest, who's it really up to
rapping fire, you better run for the pacifier 
tie you up and drown you in the saliva quagmire 
till your oxygen expires and your lungs dry up 
'cause you said Bis ain't dope, you a damn liar 
disaster for hire over beats by pious 
flow like the Tigris, Euphrates, with the Eye of the Tiger 
in my iris, Canibus is a fighter 
motherfucker, my greatgrandfather was Irish 
let's roll the dices, 'll break you like young Tyson 
give me the mic man, I don't need no hype man 
put a thousand on me, put one on him 
i tear off his limbs, throw him in, and tell him to swim 
yo I soak that shit and coat that shit in soy sauce 
tell the FCC boss, turn that noise off 
call Detroit's Mafia Boss 
tell him yo, I got a job for you, I want you to bust his balls 
Drop him off by Niagra Falls 
write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws 
nobody disrespects lyrical law 
I'm the best there ever is and the best ever was 
training like a grunt face down in the mud 
with blood, sweat, and tears, sucking it up 
yo, you wonder where I am right now 
I'm probably somewhere on the microphone fucking it up 
dead or alive, Canibus will live through the rhyme 
to be the illest on the mic is a mission of mine 
spittin' divine, you can't get it twisted this time 
vocal with a mirror to make sure my lips are aligned 
Dr C, PHD graduated from UMG 
bright as the LCD display on a new MP
prototype of a true MC 
with 3d topography maps you can't see 
Butcher on Broad Street, wrapping CDs 
in butcher paper, doing artwork with Sharpies 
if you don't like the quality, then talk to me 
what the fuck you on the website for you creep? 
punching the keys, remember that sound 
that's exactly what it sounds like when i'm punching your teeth 
kick a rap, bitch, if you've got the gumption to speak 
stand next to me, i might put a lump in your meat 
diss you and your man, double the beef 
to tell you the truth, I thought your rebuttal was weak 
round the outside, blah, blah, etcetra, etcetra 
the body of my literature is bigger than South America 
nigga look, this is all I gots to say 
suck my P-H-D-I-C-K</pre>
