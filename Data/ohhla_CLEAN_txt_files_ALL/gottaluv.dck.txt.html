[Sample]
You know, One of the most beautiful things in life
Is when a boy finds the girl that he loves
And in his mind some of the things he wants to do with that girl
Are almost impossible
You see girl, I've never been in love before
But God knows I truely...

[Intro during sample: Inspectah Deck]
It's not a love song, It's not a love song

[Inspectah Deck]
Posted up in the Yukon, Wu's on
Oak dash, Twenty-five inch shoes on
New borns get a glimpse before he move on
Hat back with the money green boots on
Wu-Tang, You wit it we can do thangs
Do hang in the valley where the fools bang
Move mayn, In Cali make em who bang
Smooth King, White Nike's with the new blue frames
Get it poppin, Don't let the cops in
Kid's locked in the top ten, Watch him
Boxed inside the projects boppin
Spot him by the live niggas plottin
For bank rolls, Chuckas with the gray soles
Trank hoes, To slid outta they cloths
Feelin that, They hands to the ceiling black
Peel back on your Ninja, Wheelie that
Where you really at, Man up, Stand up
If you aint never scared throw your hands up
Throw your hands up
I'm mack six, Stay linked with a bad chick
Stack dick, She a model slash actress
I smashed it in back of the whip
Grabbed her digits, Then jetted back to the strip
I rushed through shine'n like truck jewels
Like Russel, I'll hit you with the crush groove
It's what I must do, Plus what I'm up to
Bare knuckle in the grind, Still a hustle
We all that cousin, Won't you fall back
You a small cat trickin on mall rats
You aint really ready for the combat
Where your balls at, What you call that
What you call that

You know, One of the most beautiful things in life
