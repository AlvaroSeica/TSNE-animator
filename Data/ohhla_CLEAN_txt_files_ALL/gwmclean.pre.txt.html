[Chorus repeat x2]
Baby, grind with me, relax your mind, take your time with me
I'll love you deeper if you grind for me
Now come and kiss me 'til your body gets weak
Just grind with me

[Verse 1]
When I grind, I make 'em say (Oh)
Slow grinding be my day (job)
I grind 'em in the back of my (car)
Keep it moving like a see (saw)
I make 'em laugh and giggle
Cuddle a little
Kiss on the neck
Like girl, let me see that thing jiggle
Girlfriend, your body so (raw)
I can tell you a superstar
B-L-U-E-S-T-A (R)
I can tell around the block how sexy you (are)
I drink red bull so I keep stamina
What's my name, what's my name?
(What's my name?)
Pretty Ricky, pretty boy
Doing pretty good thangs
Making pretty good change
Yeah pretty good (edited)
From the pretty, pretty chicks
Yeah pretty damn rich
Pretty Ricky, Rickie Rickie
And the Mavericks

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Light this candle, let me set the scene for you baby
Out the shower, so fresh and so clean baby
Staring in your eyes
I can see the fire
You're hypnotized
Can you feel the vibe?
(Ohhhhhhhhhh)
Staring in your eyes
I can see the fire
You're hypnotized
Do you feel the vibe?
[Step 1] You're kissin' on me
[Step 2] Girl you can let me softly
[Step 3] Now you see why you chose me
[Step 4] And ooh, you're vibing with me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Slick got more game than a little bit
Baby girl 5' 5", brown eyes with them thick lips
Thick thighs with the slim hips
Sugar, honey, ice, tea, baby girl so sweeeeeet, and a bag of chips
I like to catch her when she coming home
Like side, girl you know it's on
Looking good in a sundae cone
You got me hoping, no sugarcoatin'
Your tounge is stroking, no joking
Girl I'm focused, the bedroom smoking
Get some air up in this room girl!
(Heavy breathing)
If loving you is wrong, then I don't wanna be right
So I'ma take my time and do it right
Cause we got all night, cause we got all night
Baby girl just...

[Chorus x2]</pre>
