[Yelawolf]
Everybody's askin me lately, where I'm from
They wanna know what I've been through, and what dirt I've done
But man if I told you what I've seen and been through then you'd probably run off
You're scared of the truth, so it's dead in secret lined in chalk
See I've been lost, ever since I could walk
Lookin for my daddy, in any one of my momma's boyfriends who would talk
Or listened to me when I spoke, instead of lookin at me like a joke
Or leavin me behind, leavin me to cry when you treated my momma like a hoe
But I learned quick, that my daddy wasn't never gonna come around
And I didn't give a shit, cause me and my momma we held it down
No new kicks, first day of school I'm Goodwill bound
But when you come from the trench, that's how you learned to walk around
So I don't give a fuck if you ever lay eyes on top of my new shoes homie
I just wanted you to know that I didn't need a dollar from you, I got 'em myself
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with a bottle drinkin yourself lonely
Then you can keep company with a picture of me in a magazine on the shelf
Turn the page

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
Daddy can you see me? I'm puttin on a show
In the magazines, hear me on the radio
So what do you think? Well I hope that you're proud now
To watch it all go down
I'm sorry daddy, you didn't get to watch me grow
Now I'm always on the road, no time to say hello
Bye, and I hope that you're proud now
To watch it all go down, down, down, down

[Yelawolf]
Yeah momma you look great, perfect
Be safe on your first date, for certain
If he brings you home too late, I'll hurt him
Don't worry 'bout me I'm safe, I'll close the curtains
And I feel like I'm raising you, but what do I know? Baby blue
All I know is that I was made in you, so I put all my faith in you
Yeah I was only 10, but I felt like a man, and I had to let you go
All I wanted was for us to be rich, teardrops in my cereal bowl
So I turned into an asshole, young and dumb, smokin weed
Vandalizin, robbin houses, stealin cars, that was me
But everything I did I had to see, feel the pain, had to grieve
To become, who I am, and I'm proud of the man I came to be
Cause what I've learned could not be taught, what I've earned cannot be bought
Justified, deserved it all, so don't be concerned, it's not your fault
I never counted sheep, I count my blessings
So if you see him out momma don't give him the cold shoulder, give him my message
Just tell him
