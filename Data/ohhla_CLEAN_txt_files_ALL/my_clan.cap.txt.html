They wanna see us buried but you know we never worry
Poppin off the jammies only if it's necessary, Stakin commissary
Their curtains gettin low, We gotta get that in the heavy
Hit us on the celly, We be lampin at the tele
We tussle with the Jakes and we livin in the belly
Goin through the struggle but it's only necessary
And after that, You know we attack
