Song:   This Train
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This train is bound to glory, this train
This train is bound to glory, this train
This train is bound to glory,
This train don't carry unholy
This train is bound to glory, this train

Choo choo choo, choo choo choo
Choo choo choo, choo choo choo

When I was just a kid
My daddy use to sing this song
Now I've grown to be a man
It lingers deep within my soul
Lingers deep within my soul

This train is bound for glory, this train
This train is bound for glory, this train
This train is bound for glory, nobody Rides but the righteous and the holy
This train is bound for glory, this train

This train has left the station, this train
This train has left the station, this train
This train has left the station,
This train carries every nation
This train is bound to glory, this train

Choo choo choo, choo choo choo
Choo choo choo, choo choo choo

When I was a kid
My daddy would sing this song
Now I've grown to be a man
It lingers deep within my soul
Lingers deep within my soul

This train is bound for glory, this train
This train is bound for glory, this train
This train, gotta get on this train

Choo choo choo, choo choo, choo
Choo choo choo, choo choo, choo
Choo choo choo, choo choo, choo
Choo choo choo, choo choo, choo
Choo choo choo, choo choo, choo</pre>
