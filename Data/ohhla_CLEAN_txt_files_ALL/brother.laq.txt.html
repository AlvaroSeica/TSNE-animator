Let it be heard

Knowledge
the highest level of understanding
wisdom must come forth
Yo Laquan, speak

[ VERSE 1: Laquan ]
Keepin in tact cause I express myself on wax
Read between the lines as I state the facts
The fact is known, you gotta be strong to live long
And know the difference from right and wrong
What's done in the dark will soon shine in the light
You're provin em right by suckin the pipe, stereotype
Media hype is killing me
Why must my brothers steal from me?
Woman is queen, she feeds what you need at birth
Research of self, develops your mental health
Man is king, lead the route
But some sell out and find a quick way out
By selling poison to another
Poison for pay rotts the brain away
Caught in the devil's trap
Some call it dope, some call it crack
Call it what you want, it doesn't matter what the name is
The effect is still the same
Your life goes down the drain in constant pain
For a $20 plane ride
Comin from inside of me - truth
You can hide from me, you can't hide from facts, black
Sorry if I've blown your cover
I must tell it like it is, brother to brother

(Alright)
Brother to brother

[ VERSE 2: Laquan ]
Open your third eye, vision a clear sight
As we take a flight into the life of parasites
Some will feed and never give, that's pure greed
Climbin, climbin but I'm constantly pulled back
Is it the wrong steps or is it because I'm black?
We're alkin in circles pacin the same track
Never will win a war with someone else
We're havin this devilish war within ourselves
Brothers and sisters, you are the listeners
The react is the track will attack like a maniac
If in your blackness, teach your brother practice
Black awareness, don't be scared of this
I'm on a mission to fix up the mixed up
Constantly strivin is the way I'm survivin
The sermon is written to better the way you're livin
Speakin of livin - I'm livin positive
I'm on a quest to redeem your self-esteeem
Rehabilitate those who lost faith
This here lesson is leavin a reflection
On the young to grow to be strong ones
A weak mind is brainwashed easily
I'm not blind, I see what you're feedin me
History, you got it twisted
Your leaders are written, mine are unlisted
I praise God and no other
Words from me to you, brother to brother
Brother to brother, brother to brother

(Alright)

(Alright)
Brother to brother

[ VERSE 3: Laquan ]
Accused of abusin freedom of speech
The reason for that, they dislike what I teach
Never in life would I fight for this land
The U.S. cares less about a blackman
Now's the time to react and impact
On the minor set-backs, follow the right tracks
Caged in a false educational system
The government's on my back because I dissed em
With a middle finger and a balled fist
Hidin the truth and feedin us bullshit
I use the mic as a tool to guide the fool
From a pool of danger I speak with anger
And authority, I show loyalty
Believe in me and I can prove reality is definitely a part of me
By speaking to you brother to brother

(Alright)

(Alright)
Brother to brother

Yo, peace to all babies born</pre>
