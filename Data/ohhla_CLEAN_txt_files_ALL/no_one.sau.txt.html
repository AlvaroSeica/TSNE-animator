[Saul Williams]
No one ever does..
No one ever does..
Memories are like promises that are seldom kept
Hence, why Jesus wept
Every day, we are torn away from the one we love
There's no God above
Only if you would spend your gift to uphold the truth of just me and you
And we represent all the time we've spent getting to this day
There's no other way
Aren't we whom we claim to be the descendents of, whom we place above?
We must place within and slowly begin...  to love
Ohhhh, no one ever does (No one ever does)
No one ever does (No one ever does)...
Ohhhh, no one ever does (No one ever does)
No one ever does (No one ever does)
Suddenly, who I thought was me was not me at all and I feel so small
Sitting way beneath who I want to be
I don't want to be who I've grown to be
Only if I might somehow riff on the way before, let it be some more
Lift me from this floor
If I can't walk I'll crawl to looooooooove
Ohhhh, no one ever does (No one ever does)
No one ever does (No one ever does)...
Ohhhh, no one ever does (No one ever does)
No one ever does (No one ever does)</pre>
