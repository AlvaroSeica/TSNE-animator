[Frank Ocean]
Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-huh..
Uh-huh...

I think I started somethin... 
I got what I wanted... Did, didn't I? 
Can't feel nothin, super-human
Even when I'm fuckin,  Viagra poppin 
Every single record, Auto-Tunin
Zero, emotion, muted, emotion 
Pitch corrected, computed, emotion, uh-huh...
I blame it on the, model broad with the Hollywood smiiiiile... ow!
Stripper booty and a rack like woooooow... - brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella, I went to see Jigga 
She went to see Z-Trip... - perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn 
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really baaaaaaad-ly 
She's in school payin, for tuition doin porn in the Vaaaaaaall-ey 
...at least you workin
But girl I can't feel my face.. 
What are we smokin' anyway?
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste, 
but can you taste, a little taste?"

[Chorus]
Novacane, baby, baby 
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, nummmmmb...

Sink full of dishes, pacin in the kitchen 
Cocaine for breakfast... Yikes~!
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod 
Little red light on shootin, I'm feelin like 
Stanley Kubrick... 
...This is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my +Eyes Wide Shut+ but it keeps on movin
I blame it on the, model broad with the Hollywood smiiii-hiiiile
Stripper booty with the rack like wooooooow-how-hoooow
I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feelin I never had, never had, never had.. (never)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back and pick it up and put it back
Now I'm somethin like the chemist on caaaaaaaam-pus
But there's no drug a-ROUND... quite like what I FOUND in you, you
I still can't feel my face.. 
What am I smokin anyway?
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste
but can you taste, a little taste?"

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane (ohhhh) 
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain (Yeah...)
Novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane, novacane (ohh-ho..)
For the pain, for the pain... novacane, novacane

[Repeat 2X]
Ohhh-hooooo 
Ohhh-hoooo, ohh-hooooo
Ohhh-hooooo
Ohhh-hooooo-ho-ho-oh-ohhhh 

Pretty girls involved with me
Makin pretty love to me 
Pretty... pity pity...
All the pretty girls involved with me
Makin pretty love to me 
Pretty... pity pity...
Ohh-ooh-whoa I, can't feel a thing
I can't feel, can't feel a thing
Can't feel a thing
Can't feel, feel, feel-feel her
I can't feel-feel her..
Novacane, novacane, novacane
I can't feel-feel her..
Novacane for the pain, for the pain
I can't feel-feel her..
Feel her, feel her
Ohh... I can't feel-feel her..
Novacane, novacane...cane</pre>
