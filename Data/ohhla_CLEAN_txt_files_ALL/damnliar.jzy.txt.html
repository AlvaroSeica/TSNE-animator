Song:   Damn Liar
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I got some real bitches with me for patrone we on that avion
I'm talking real jury nigga fuck that shit got a mercedes on
No timers in my watch damn right it cost a jaguar
Seat up in that 'rari thing that be faster than a race car

[Chorus]
You's a God damn liar, you's a God damn liar
Thinking I ain't getting money you's a God damn liar
Thinking we 'bout that life that you's a God damn liar
If you think we think it twice you's a God damn liar
You's a God damn liar, you's a God damn liar
Thinking we ain't counting money you's a God damn liar
Thinking we ain't getting money you's a God damn liar
If you think we think it twice you's a God damn liar

Hoes gonna be hoes, and niggaz gon' be niggaz
Hussles gon' be dealers, and niggaz gon' pull triggers
Yeah how much I deny rest, I can not collect
If you ain't got no money just pay me in respect
Martin Luther, Malcom Young ye I pay the way
Niggaz acting like I'm still gon' hop out of that cake
Man I can't even sleep too busy parting on you busters
If I'm ever in the spot ain't no balling on you suckers
If a nigga tell you different then he motherfucking lie
Bitch I do this shit until I motherfucking die
Hopped off the porch when I was 20 get no rest
If I ever lie then let them 40's hit me in my chest

[Chorus]
You's a God damn liar, you's a God damn liar
Thinking I ain't getting money you's a God damn liar
Thinking we 'bout that life that you's a God damn liar
If you think we think it twice you's a God damn liar
You's a God damn liar, you's a God damn liar
Thinking we ain't counting money you's a God damn liar
Thinking we ain't getting money you's a God damn liar
If you think we think it twice you's a God damn liar

Nigga you a liar, and you motherfucking know it
And all that gangster shit you niggaz talking yea I'm for it
They hating ass shit, oh don't get you so fucked
Then you turn around and look around and nigga there you are
In the same damn place, damn right with no progress
To be this nigga here, it takes a process
First you got to hit the block like a real nigga
Then you gonna hit the booth and straight kill niggaz
I don't feel niggaz but you bet they felt me
Be a cold day in hell before they melt me
Got my first glock then hit the block ain't get no rest
If I ever lie then let them 40's hit me in my chest

[Chorus]
You's a God damn liar, you's a God damn liar
Thinking I ain't getting money you's a God damn liar
Thinking we 'bout that life that you's a God damn liar
If you think we think it twice you's a God damn liar
You's a God damn liar, you's a God damn liar
Thinking we ain't counting money you's a God damn liar
Thinking we ain't getting money you's a God damn liar
If you think we think it twice you's a God damn liar

How you going for it and you know these niggaz lie
Half the hood locked up, and the other half dying
These lying ass rappers man I swear these niggaz trying
Just to make it another day nigga everybody trying
So fuck the world now nigga who in it and who ain't with me
I'm bound to fuck count the federalies come and get me
This shit ain't the game shit here's the game
I'm talking real jail, real prisons and everything
That's why I put the God on this truth and every bond
Time is cold out here got a heater in every car
See my first quarter mill when I was 20 ain't get no rest
If I ever lie then let them 40's hit me in my chest

[Chorus]
You's a God damn liar, you's a God damn liar
Thinking I ain't getting money you's a God damn liar
Thinking we 'bout that life that you's a God damn liar
If you think we think it twice you's a God damn liar
You's a God damn liar, you's a God damn liar
Thinking we ain't counting money you's a God damn liar
Thinking we ain't getting money you's a God damn liar
If you think we think it twice you's a God damn liar</pre>
