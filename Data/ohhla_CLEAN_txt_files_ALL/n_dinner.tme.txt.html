It's two in the morning he's sitting in the diner
Waitress stressed out with raccoon eyeliner
He's dunking pound cakes in black coffee
The cook is sick on your food he's coughing
The voices in his head won't stop talking
Humans aren't pretty on the inside, they're just blood and guts
Most of them are roaches the rest are just nuts
The cities full of police, bums and sluts
You could count the days by the dishes in the sink
His motel sheets and the sky are pink
It used to be kaleidoscope now its periscope eyes
It used to be Lucy now its pollution in the sky
Welcome to Interzone, home of misery
I say hello to the man in the mirror that isn't me
He waited half a cigarette, left the tip in his pocket
He's lost his mind, paranoia's in the cockpit
I grabbed a toothpick on my way out
I brushed off the doubt and I started to shout
Why'd I come into this diner with the low down blues?
Why'd I come to this diner when I was looking for you?

I walk to my grave where the worms wait to greet me
I sit naked I'm the dinner, eat me
The worms eat the worms we all get devoured
The dinner is naked and the truth is sour

Naked Dinner, guns and alarm clocks
Naked Dinner, the truth is a long shot
When you come to dinner come fully naked
It's just a body it's nothing sacred 

This is for the wood that discovered it was a violin
This is for the man who got 2 new bracelets and the right for silence
I think this bodies running out of mileage
You could tell by the way I blink these concrete eyelids
As another crooked cop ignores a crime
A melancholy baby dies from an overdose of time
The mugwamps are fighting in the diner
It used to be red, white and blue
Now its rubies, diamonds and sapphires
Gold brick street, that's the path of a liar
The fork in the road gave my motivation a flat tire
As another monk takes a bath in fire
We all pile the excuses higher
The cops have electronic eyes 
That weigh your food and luggage
I love it ill put no drug above it
We don't care no more so fuck it 
The freeway is a river of tin and steel 
Full of unhappy people, waiting for happy meals
Yeah naked dinner

I walk to my grave where the worms wait to greet me
I sit naked I'm the dinner, eat me
The worms eat the worms we all get devoured
The dinner is naked and the truth is sour

Naked Dinner, guns and alarm clocks
Naked Dinner, the truth is a long shot
When you come to dinner come fully naked
It's just a body it's nothing sacred 

Here comes dr. Benway straight out the S.O.A.
He's got the Guantanamo skills
Got so much medication, he's playing dominos with pills
Cigarette holes in his bathrobe, coffee stains on the floor
He fills your cup with black water and asks if you want more
Tio Sam, don't give a damn
About no union or working man
What they call justice, I call a joke
They exhale the lies and disappear behind the tea smoke
Give me 6 hours to chop down a tree 
I'll spend 4 sharpening my ax
But what do you do when lies become facts
Relax Gandhi, never attacked
Relax King, never attacked
Relax Chavez, never attacked
Relax Diana Nash, never attacked
Relax J, never attacked
I'm naked at the table staring at an empty plate
We both wait and we call it fate
The greys all wait and they call it fate

When the truth hits the plate like naked dinner

I walk to my grave where the worms wait to greet me
I sit naked I'm the dinner, eat me
The worms eat the worms we all get devoured
The dinner is naked and the truth is sour

Naked Dinner, guns and alarm clocks
Naked Dinner, the truth is a long shot
When you come to dinner come fully naked
It's just a body it's nothing sacred</pre>
