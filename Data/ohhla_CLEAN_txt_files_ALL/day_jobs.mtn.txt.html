Can't stand my damn day job.. that's right

Hate.. oh man I hate my day job (oh man I hate my day job)
Yes sir I hate my day job (yes sir I hate my day job)
I really hate my freakin day job (I really hate my freakin day job)
Mr. Man I hate my day job (Mr. Man I hate my day job)
I can't stand my damn day job (I can't stand my damn day job)
Man I want to quit my day job (Man I want to quit my day job)
But I have to keep my day job (But I have to keep my day job)
I really hate my day job (Yeah I really hate my day job)

[Verse One]
Psssh I hate the freakin bakery seems they seem to make me
into a laughin stock (HA HA!) have to rock the puffy hat
Pastry apron with the matchin socks (whaaaat?)
God damn I gotta wear this PLEASE; I got a rep
It's a lot of times I hide for the hotties not to get a glimpse
But since it didn't fly I apply for a nine to five
at the five and dime (damn) about that much is mine
if I keep the ice cream machine nice and clean
Scheme to steal the dollar lotteries, all that's gotten me
is a slew of losers in my cotton briefs
Stop with these condescending attitudes, do I have to shoot the coochie
but wait, we after snatchin dollars while we chasin comets after hours
If it's now, or later I'ma catch it 'til then
resume my duties, replenish the relish and the ketchup
Uhh, check check check it, out
Everybody gotta work the day, job
Mountain Brothers, like this
Mountain Brothers just dress like this

[Chorus]
I can't stand my damn day job (I can't stand my damn day job)
Man I want to quit my day job (Man I want to quit my day job)
But I have to keep my day job (But I have to keep my day job)
I really hate my day job (Yeah I really hate my day job)

[Verse Two]
About to kill everybody
I hate toilin in mud it's straight boilin my blood
The soil and the suds to scrub the oil and the crud (eww)
off the apron I'm wearin daily, along with the same type pants
This ain't the right plan, I blame the white man a jerk
Yo man he sure can yell, screamin clean them white tables
Deep inside I really fiend for mic cables
Like fables Aesop/I sop, restroom floors with a dry mop
Prayin for success doin tours but why stop?
Cause Dave Thomas gave a promise, and I wanna save for momma's
birthday, in the worst way, but first stay away from trauma (yup)
On Thursday I'ma get a raise, all of fifty cents
Yeah yeah hard work they said it pays
A dreaded phrase, but better days are comin (that's right)
Makin crazy sums to rest and chill in style
But for now a lazy bum that's blessed with skill
and luck of many, just to feel a buck and the pennies
Went from Wendy's to Friendly's yet still I'm stuck at Denny's what?
Yeah that's my day job
I hate the day job; please, let me quit my day job
Please

[Chorus]
I really hate my freakin day job (I really hate my freakin day job)
Mr. Man I hate my day job (Mr. Man I hate my day job)
I can't stand my damn day job (I can't stand my damn day job)
Man I want to quit my day job (Man I want to quit my day job)
But I have to keep my day job (But I have to keep my day job)
I really hate my day job (Yeah I really hate my day job)

[Verse Three]
Took a crack at success and fell through
Now can I help who's next in line, you best to find yourself a job son
My daddy said but that shit's dead I'm not the one, not me
At the job see they got me Chops cleanin toilet bowls 'n shit
(Yo that's hurtin) Unemployed, although I tried to avoid it (yeah)
Finally annoyed at bein exploited
So I chose to get ghost and quit, to do music
But most don't know that it's more
than just grabbin mics and gettin applause (yup)
It's, hirin lawyers for deciphirin clauses in wack-ass contracts
Receivin faxes from industry contacts
Racks of EQ displayin bands of frequencies
And seein what we can do bout payin these damn legal fees (damn)
Talent and management agencies
They each gon' take a piece that pays me G's (I know)
Please finish your verse and then rehearse it
Who purchased the rights to manufacture merchandise?
Sample clearances (yup) in-store performance appearances (uh-huh)
Production of beats and discussion of publishin
Split sheet percentages and it just don't stop
And it just don't stop, and it just don't stop
And it just don't stop

[Chorus]
I really hate my freakin day job (I really hate my freakin day job)
Mr. Man I hate my day job (Mr. Man I hate my day job)
I can't stand my damn day job (I can't stand my damn day job)
Man I want to quit my day job (Man I want to quit my day job)
But I have to keep my day job (But I have to keep my day job)
I really hate my day job (Yeah I really hate my day job)
Oh man I hate my day job (oh man I hate my day job)
Yes sir I hate my day job (yes sir I hate my day job)
I really hate my freakin day job (I really hate my freakin day job)
Mr. Man I hate my day job (Mr. Man I hate my day job)
I can't stand my damn day job (I can't stand my damn day job)
Man I want to quit my day job (Man I want to quit my day job)

Man I hate my damn day job (But I hate my day job)
I wanna quit my day job (I wanna quit my day job)
But I have to keep my day job (But I have to keep my day job)
Now you know I hate my day job (I really hate my day jooooooooob)</pre>
