Song:   Hit 'Em La
Typed by: Tha Masta

[Chorus x2: La the Darkman]
Hit 'em La, I'ma hit and let the fifth split 'em
Make coroners come and get 'em, I get with 'em

[La the Darkman]
Fuck 'em!
Darkman, call me Dracula, better yet Blackula
Got a quote to buy me a villa in East Africa
Leer jet passin' ya, move and I'm blastin' ya
Kill niggaz like the St. Valentine's Day Massacre
And I ain't gassin' ya, my dimes be sassier
Bitch like Christina Milian in my passenger
I ain't gotta care, I grew up on welfare
But I handle the rock like Sebastian Telfair
If you fuckin' with me, you better have some health care
Cuz ya mama gon' scream when the doctor guild get there
Hostage is one brand when ya damn near dead
When them bullets hit ya chest, hit ya neck, hit ya head
Motherfucker!

[Chorus x2]

[La the Darkman]
Niggaz say I'm insane but I'm perfectly sane
My money gettin' right so I'ma cop the new Range
Dry that pot, get that bakin' soda, mix it with the 'caine
Put it on the stove, twist the knob, turn up the flame
I'm glad I came and she glad she came
Strapped her up with them thangs and she get that money man
From Miami to New York, makin' trips on the plane
Every time she touch down, I light that purple rain
I really mastered the flow, I'm still passionate though
I'm international, I squeeze the calico
Tryin' to keep the feds off me cuz my whip kinda flossy
Can't nann nigga fuck me cuz I stay lookin' saucy
This La...

[Chorus x8 - over outro]

[Outro: La the Darkman]
That's just what it is, man
It's not even a fairy tale, man
You know, You know...
I'ma just make it do what it do, man
That's what up... one plus one equal two
All you stupid-ass niggaz who dropped outta school know
You know, You know...
For you smart dumb niggaz
As my nigga Pretty Toney say, man
You know, you know...
S.S.R.'s the motherfuckin' gang, man
No doubt... Embassy Entertainment's the motherfuckin' label, man
Cannon Music, man, you know?
Uh, you know, W.T.K., man, you know
Big Joe, man, Shotti Screw, man
Killa K, man
Raw Rule, E.B., you know Facts Man and shit
Mena, man... 1G, man
'Nough talent, man...
S.S.R., man...</pre>
