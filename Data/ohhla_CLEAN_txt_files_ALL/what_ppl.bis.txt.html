What. People. Do. For. Money. [x2]

[Chorus]
(People do)
Anything is
(What people do)
Fuck bein' broke as shit
Need to be posted rich
(People do)
Wicked as
(What people do for money)
It's do or die
(For money)
(People do)
Grind is
(What people do)
This weight don't get you paid
No way to situate
(What people do)
Work is
(What people do for money)
We hustlin'
(For money)

[Verse One]
(People do)
All types of shit
Your own granny might blam you for a chunk of your chips
Your own family rip you off on some Gary Coleman shit
Blood is thicker than water, but not a stack of hundreds
It's been true since the beginnin' of time
Remember Judas betrayed Christ for a couple of shines
You done heard this shit 'bout a billion fuckin' times
But money makes the world go 'round, bottom line
Man it's crazy
(What people do)
For the moola, cheese
Green, dividends
Stoop so low, they even rob they best friends
They ain't got no shame, it's a fucked up game
In the streets, niggas kill for a dollar bill
Now imagine what they do for a record deal

[Chorus]
(People do)
Cheatin' is
(What people do)
Act like they needy for it
Because they greedy for it
(People do)
Lyin' is
(What people do for money)
People betray you
(For money)
(People do)
Stab you in the back is
(What people do)
Your mind inflictin' pain for a meal ticket gain
(People do)
Sell they soul is
(What people do for money)
People will kill you
(For money)

[Verse Two]
(People do)
They shadiest tricks
Have you ghost writin' for 'em, ain't payin' you shit
Open up for 'em, they ain't payin' a cent
Forget the times you loaned 'em money, helped them pay they rent
Slept on your floor
Wore your clothes
He had to borrow your car, but won't let you drive the Rolls
That's cold
So cold (brrrrrr)
Why can't niggas ever stick to the code?
But see that's just 
(What people do)
For the cream, cheddar, paper, skrilla
Betray family, they own hood, sound familiar?
It's so sad but true
Better listen to the lyrics, it can happen to you
(Cause money makes the world act a fool)

[Chorus]
Hatin' is
(What people do)
Plottin' to leave you stuck
To fill they pocket up
(What people do)
Foul is
(What people do for money)
People will set you up
(For money)
(People do)
Jack you is
(What people do)
To rob you at random
To get a ransom
(People do)
Evil is
(What people do for money)
People are scandalous  
(For money)

[Verse Three]
(What people do)
Anything and everything
Name it it's been done
A billion times and countin', nothin' new under the sun
Pimpin', lyin', cheatin', stealin'
Snitchin', whorin', don't forget killin'
Cause niggas ain't playin'
Been poppin' motherfuckers since the cavemen
Like some kill they parents just for the inheritance 
Others may for money push they spouse off the terrace (AHHHHHHH!)
Then cash that check
For that lucci, lettuce, pesos, Benjamins
It's even bigger, money hustlin' religion
Pastors to Pope's makin' money like it's dope
Slangin' dreams to the fiends got 'em hooked on hope
It's so wicked

[Chorus]
(People do)
Pimpin' is
(What people do)
Cause sex sells
It collects mail
(People do)
Hoein' is
(What people do for money)
Some give up they bodies
(For money)
(People do)
Preachin' is
(What people do)
Because the gift of gab
Can get you grips of cash
(People do)
Turn you out is
(What people do for money)
Motherfuckers lose it
(For money)
(People do)
Cause money makes the world act a fool
(People do)
(For money)
Cause money makes the world act a fool</pre>
