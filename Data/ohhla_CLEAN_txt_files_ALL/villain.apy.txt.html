[Intro]
I tried to tell them about you I don't know if I did the right thing
I'm not sure how they're going to react

[Apathy]
Keep the money comin, keep it so filthy
Keep your brain greedy, that's how this world built me
Picture Genghis Khan, picture Megatron
Now picture BP, picture Exxon
Picture Presidents, dead ones, alive ones
Black ones, white ones, devils in they eyes ones
Picture priests, picture the preacher, picture the prophet
Picture popes, picture police with padded pockets
Picture parents in a picture-perfect town
with a pinch of pedophilia that tends to sneak around
Think of politicians, they makin a killin
and then they wanna turn around and call me a villain?
Picture devils and demons with disguises
Smilin with eyes tatted on they closed eyelids
Picture handshakes, that most never notice
The picture's always been there it's simply how you focus

[Chorus: samples of the phrase "the villain"]

[Apathy]
This ain't trap music, this ain't frat music
It's mosh pit shit, get your skull cracked to it
This ain't devil music, it's just the study of
It ain't the murder weapon, but it's the bloody glove
This is the thesis to show you who the beast is
The propaganda professors would never teach this
Picture people that will profit off religion
Now picture physicians who profit off certain prescriptions
Picture principals, parent-teacher conference
ADHD, and all that other nonsense
Psychologists will talk us out of all wisdom
While vaccine shots give children autism
Our community leaders, mislead us
With laws that'll take away our nine millimeters
Picture men who'll say that they speak for Jesus
I'll believe that shit when Hell freezes

[Chorus]

[Ill Bill]
Yo, check it~! Yo, yo, yo, yo
Lifers in the booth, snipers on the roof
Picture military personnel that like to shoot
Picture heroism, fill out your application
Picture terrorism, picture assassination
Picture pistols that pop instantly
Picture silencers that muffle the sound of gunshots efficiently
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
Now picture a thousand pictures of a mushroom cloud about to burst
Picture cloudy skies on the day that Howie died
Picture metal detectors inside Canarsie High
Picture a newborn baby with a gas mask
Picture a New York skyscraper avalanche
A cameraman is kidnapped by the Taliban
Decapitated they sent his head into Pakistan
Picture the gruesome twit videos and pics
Picture triple six; picture the villain that live within

[Chorus]

[Outro]
A boy, in the Midwest of this land
will grow up in a home where your book will be on the shelf
and spoken of often; he will grow up with these ideas in his head
He will grow into a great orator
He will speak and his words will be heard throughout this land
and throughout the world; his boy will become leader of this country
and begin a movement of great change
He will speak of you and your words
Your book will be the seeds of many of his great thoughts
It will be the seeds of change</pre>
