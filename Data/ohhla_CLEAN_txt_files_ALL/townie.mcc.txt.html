"Where are we?"
"I'm thirsty."
"There's a church up ahead, maybe there's something in here..."

[Door open]

"These don't look like Presbyterians!"
"They look like... puppets."

"I THOUGHT WE SOUNDED REALLY GOOD, MAN, I THOUGHT WE SOUNDED PRETTY GOOD!"
"OHHHHHH, YEEEEEAAAH!"

All these rappers are so serious, it's crackin' me up
Kid consumers tired of posers so he's backin' me up
Jump in the back of the truck, or the front of my bike
mc chris is comin' to your town. ("Aiight.")
I'm the Dungeon Master master of the ceremony
comin' to your territory, cheese it up like macaroni
We'll get seven kinds of stoney in the parking lot proper;
want me to hit your jurisdiction, just submit Chris an offer
Girls be neckin' on my wood in your neck of the woods
Groupie girlies give it up because pup got the goods
You think that they'd be less devout over somethin' so stout
but I guess they're all about Guiness 'cause they're turnin' me out
This is for the anthem kids 'cause they know who Ansem is
I'm not a corporate clown so it's not like they could cancel Chris
I'm just an activist, my fans are cyber savages
I may seem kinda lame but I got more game then babbages

mc chris is comin' to your town tonight
mc chris is down to bring the sound to life
On the pressure point precise like a kid on Fisher Price
watch him kick it wicked nice on the microphone device
mc chris is comin' to your town tonight
mc chris is down to bring the sound to life
On the pressure point precise like a kid on Fisher Price
watch him kick it wicked nice on the microphone device

mc's going platinum, the Cubs won the pennant race
ice comin' out my ass like my name was Bobby Drake
a hundred hoes with no clothes comin' out my birthday cake;
did I fail to mention everything I say is kinda fake?
It's how Mister Ward escapes when the people player hate
when I'm feelin' kinda down, overlooked and overweight
I roll back my eyes, clear my mind and proceed
paint a picture-perfect world called the house of mc
You don't have to visit, you can always not listen
even though a world without my music's kinda cataclysmic
I used to rip tickets. Karate kick districts;
kinda like Kismet, like when Leia met Wickett. ("Jub jub.")
Decadent downloads put a dump in your rump
That's right, I'm shittin' your pants, punchin' chumps in the junk
I'm surveyin' your surroundings and I'm samplin' your skunk
mc chris is comin' 'round, now's when you throw your hands up!

mc chris is comin' to your town tonight
mc chris is down to bring the sound to life
On the pressure point precise like a kid on Fisher Price
watch him kick it wicked nice on the microphone device
mc chris is comin' to your town tonight
mc chris is down to bring the sound to life
On the pressure point precise like a kid on Fisher Price
watch him kick it wicked nice on the microphone device

We delivered in the Dirty, impressed the Southwest
navigated North to ingest the best sess'
met a couple honeys and had real live sex;
okay, we just made out 'cause someone shouted, "MIC CHECK!"
We been bouncin' in the mountains, we been paid in the glades
we deliver solid products for affordable rates
roam the range, makin' change, puttin' food on our plates
got a BJ while the DJ played Duel of the Fates
Life rules and it's great, they say I'm livin' a dream
now and then it's like a nightmare though, you wouldn't believe
For the most part it's like go carts doing turns at high speed
life's a sweet summer vacation if your name is mc
People, I'm a pimp, life's a bitch, fuck what ya heard
Name a faster nerd when it comes to blastin' words
Pixels in my pocket like my name was John Lasseter
A bible camp van, it's a fifteen passenger!

mc chris is comin' to your town tonight
mc chris is down to bring the sound to life
On the pressure point precise like a kid on Fisher Price
watch him kick it wicked nice on the microphone device
mc chris is comin' to your town tonight
mc chris is down to bring the sound to life
On the pressure point precise like a kid on Fisher Price
watch him kick it wicked nice on the microphone device
