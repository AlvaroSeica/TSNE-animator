You know who you are... (love is God)
You know I... and you... you, me...
and this message is to myself...
rhymes for the mind...

Yo, frustrations, pulsations, livin' in the land of castrations
nations is overhauled with all this greed, that people need to plant seeds in deeds
I move at godspeed, buildin', 45 the degree
cyphers, right, we don't stop, peace is a prayer to the East
to maintain my sensibilities, without a foundation we gettin' weak
please, peep the words that we speak, these are the last days of false ways
ideologies and infections like disease, and in the USA everything is OK
(OK) - no matter what the people say, brothers homeless, smellin' like piss
defecatin' on the streets today is a normal thing, and everything is everything
picking up a chicken wing, to get a bite to eat up off the streets
seems like I'm livin' in hell, without the heat, huh?
But what you get is what you gave
you better watch the way you behave... this is a Prophecy

{*scratching*}
This is the Prophecy... Prophecy...
a simple Prophecy...
Prophecy... this is he Prophecy.... Prophecy (fade out)

Now, the time will come when money runs
Run out the mattress, house will be in slums
feminists like me borne enemy, see how the cycle revolves to envy
we empty without the cash flow
Just so you know, the world will hang his head low
disgrace and shame, but who's to blame?
Money was the food, stoppin' hunger was the aim
but the hunk of pain just got too rough
Now they wanna blow the world away in one puff
can't get enough of hurt, just a fiend
Wanna spread around the blood in between
the whole planet just can't stand it
See a little peace so you gotta release a megaton
bombs like Vietnam, but I'm calm
Cause you cannot harm the G-O-D inside of me...
this is a Prophecy

{*scratching*}
This is the Prophecy... Prophecy...
This is the Prophecy... Prophecy... (fade out)

Stereophonic, I spread antibiotic
humans across the whole world chaotic
check, six dolla pressure, rhymes get fresher
all the hard times I see make me better
and just like Lettermans, I leave hot
buildings used to be the kids chillin' spot
scared of my vocal cords, but I see the Lord
bless me with a gift, I stare at shore
on an ocean of emotion
intuition got my back so I'm coastin', past Devilish stakes
so stay awake, don't sleep - that's when they creep inside your front gate
keep your eye towards the skies
deprived of my mind, you be enterin' eternal life
breakin' cycles and bein' reborn
leavin' all the pain and sufferin' for God
your spirit's transformed - into a higher mentality...
huh, this is The Prophecy

{*scratching*}
This is the Prophecy... Prophecy...
This is a Prophecy...

Stereophonic, I spread antibiotic...
humans across the whole world chaotic..
