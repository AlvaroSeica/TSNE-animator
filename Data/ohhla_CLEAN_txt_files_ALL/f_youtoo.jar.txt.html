Typed by: AZ Lyrics

So much haters in the room, that I'm cleaning up my life with
We don't know the truth, yet
They might praying that we lose, see all them, I live in spite with
We don't hear the news, yet
So we're like fuck you, too, nigga, we ain't got to pretend
Cause we don't fuck with you, niggas, who the fuck said we're friends?

Came in this motherfucker by myself, when I leave I'm a take some more
Niggas, I'm allergic to them broke niggas, &amp; dem hatin &amp; dem hoe niggas
My rist, better be low, niggas, my bitches got a hole with 'em, the hoe
Mayday! Fuck! 2Chainz!
Came in this motherfucker by myself, when I leave I'm a take some more
Niggas, I'm allergic to them bro niggas, &amp; dem hatin &amp; dem hoe niggas
I'm a risk, better be low, niggas, my bitches got a hole with 'em
The hoe got some more with her, I'm a fucking whine, watch this person

B-blocks, go turn us, grind on gorilla, fuck us on go, dealer
Got my bitch on road killer, ride it like a fool would have
This is for a deal and is for fun
and it is eight of fun and got pussy good, then I ate a dope
Real nigga can make it up, take a cab, take a bus, just get here
My last year, yo, this year, I'm in my partner jeep with no windshield
Make more money than you should steal, big wheels, big life, dog calls, big fight
And I got that get right

So much haters in the room, and I'm cleaning up my life with
We don't know the truth, yet
They might praying that we lose, see all them, I live in spite with
We don't hear the news, yet
So we're like fuck you, too, nigga, we ain't got to pretend
Cause we don't fuck with you, niggas, who the fuck said we're friends?

Niggas gonna hate us, what they're gonna do?
I'm sure that if I was them I would hate me, too
They couldn't walk a mile in my big ass shoes. Oh, oh, excuse!
Niggas said my accent make them sick, should I say my accent made me rich?
Put it in a couple of my billboard hits, damn
By the time motherfuckers know who I am, yeah, my nigga, I'm the motherfucker man
Keep these greese boss over nigga like pan, pam, and
I live in them over circle over ready from the bine
Why the fuck I need rehearsal, you'll just urk me, you're some nerdies, see, I call y'all nigga purple
I'm so hot, yeah, I'm hot, like I'm blowing on that purple purple
Purple on my niggas and they're passing in the circle
Second hand like a motherfucker, coughing like a motherfucker
Yeah, and the only thing a nigga gonna change is gear
Yeah, motherfuckers, keep what I wear
What, I'm honest so next year, yeah, yeah, you hear?
So go ahead, say what you want, honestly, my nigga, my only bitch is talk
Honestly, my nigga, I don't give a fuck

So much haters in the room, and I'm cleaning up my life with
We don't know the truth, yet
They might praying that we lose, see all them, I live in spite with
We don't hear the news, yet
So we're like fuck you, too, nigga, we ain't got to pretend
Cause we don't fuck with you, niggas, who the fuck said we're friends?

Jarren with a J, yeah, a nigga it's hard, get hoes late that I might get on
Solo nigga, no anturage, get head in the mouth like bonne voyage
You ain't real, nigga, you a mirage, you said motherfucker like oh my God
Bitch, come and get a nigga bit of massage
Man, I want to put my dick inside of Nikki Minaj
Pull up at the club in a neon Dodge, get a hoe and take her to the drink all lounge
Nashville is full of it, get on the porch
Underdog nigga, I'm a bit dosage
What the hell yo' nigga, wanna heck 'till I go and get that F
And the ant to the care and I cared them while I'm dirty
With the twelves in the back, beat them like a
put the motherfucker aid on with the eight, yeah, yeah

Z O I I S I S, sign you bitch, got planes on deck
Got one, got ten, got twelve, five, seven, got sold upons, got swag, got tags
Niggas hate when I get love in the club in the bathroom stall, doing drugs in the club
Like from my hip on a day full of shit, pull a nigga and I draw blood in a club
Uh, get a slug in the mall, have a nigga lick the blood in a wall
Cause he open that dust and I cannot be touched, I don't fall to a fall
You ain't fucking with us
Talk to the corpse like "dammit, answer", may put him in the truck like gangster Anthony
Fuck you, your mom, your dad, your wife, your kids, your aunties and all your family

So much haters in the room, and I'm cleaning up my life with
We don't know the truth, yet
They might praying that we lose, see all them, I live in spite that
We don't hear the news, yet
So we're like fuck you, too, nigga, we ain't got to pretend
Cause we don't fuck with you, niggas, who the fuck said we're friends? </pre>
