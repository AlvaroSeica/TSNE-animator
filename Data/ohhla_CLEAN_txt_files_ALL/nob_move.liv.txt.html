(Police are still looking for the suspect)

[Intro]
Yeah, nobody move
Nobody fuckin move
All you trick ass niggas in the place, nobody move
(Still don't nothin move but the money)
Your ass is gettin robbed, straight robbed, hands in the air!
(Still don't nothin move but the money)

[Verse 1: Stretch]
Just your luck, you had a burner when I didn't
Just my luck, I knew to duck before the spittin'
The poppin and rippin', aftermath flippin',
The rugged YG's is illin, my specialty is hustling and cap peelin'
Revealin the real, the G's is packin the steal
So feel the hot ones comin out the glock guns
Funds is needed, poverty is deleted we heated
You hearin niggas in the banks that need to be treated
Weeded up, I gives a fuck what you say to me
Give it up, or get bucked just for playin me
You know the rules, dont be a fool and get that ass dropped
Wannabe's hit they knees when the gun cocks
Non-stop, I put the move on them tricks
And keep my money on, I stay cruel in the mix
The gats fixed, mastered shakin the 5-0
Back in 89 I taught the Game of Survival
I'm here now,
9-5 ought to be live and kickin'
YG'z still spotted stickin
Enough of that, don't nobody flex
Just pass me the diamond rolex
Nobody move

[Hook](x2)
Still don't nothin move but the money (Yeah!)
Still don't nothin move but the money
Nobody move
Still don't nothin move but the money
All you trick all bitches in the place, nobody move

[Verse 2: Majesty]
Me say...
Nobody moves, nobody get hurt
This a jack move chump, time to pull up your skirt
??? by the ??? and the goons, Captain like Kirk
Ali Baba and the 40-thieves puttin' in work
Duct tape, ski mask, move wrong they blast
Nigga dont be stupid, just give up the coke and cash
Let it go smooth, don't make us furthermore harass
You want your family, nod your head you understand me
Life is too hard, so motherfuck what they hand me
Never settling, to society they banned me
Tired of the crumbs, tired of selling jumps
Want it all, one shot, tired of living like bums
All you tricks done hard like money grow on trees
They be plottin on you right now, everyday they scheme
I done tie you up, fry you up, tossed in the trunk
Hearing later on, nigga raw died with the slug
No remorse in the city, niggas starving and gritty
And you be fooled, ready for calls and you quickly
Hope you niggas get me, nigga this be real shit
I'm tryin to help some of y'all from gettin peeled quick
Nigga this be real thick, wonder what you got to prove
It's only gold, thats your fam, too much to lose
It's not they fault your ass decided to snooze
Respect the game, hear em, they said nobody move


[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, nobody move, listen, they said nobody move!
(Still don't nothin move but the money)
All you trick all bitches in the place, nobody move
(Still don't nothin move but the money)
Listen up nigga, hands high, or everybody die
Nobody move
(Still don't nothin move but the money)
All you trick ass bitches in the place, nobody move

Say it again nigga, yeah nobody move,
(Still don't nothin move but the money)
All you trick ass niggas in the place
Nobody move
(Still don't nothin move but the money)
(Still don't nothin move but the money)
Nobody move
(Still don't nothin move but the money)
You hear me?
All you trick ass bitches in the place, nobody move
Nobody move
(Still don't nothin move but the money)
Live Squad
(Still don't nothin move but the money)
