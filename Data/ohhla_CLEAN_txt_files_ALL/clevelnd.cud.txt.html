[KiD CuDi]
I come from Cleveland
Ya'll can really hear it now
Hit 'em like comic books, kaboom, powpow
Into a girl's mind spit fine a wine dine
I keep two phone, sidekick for bad dimes
And a topical question is why I'm so chill
Girls don't understand, he ain't even made a mill
They say I'm complexed just like the magazine
I wear my closet complex like a magazine.

[Hook: KiD CuDi]
I get in their head, They don't even see my bread
Oh so, oh so fly cool as I wanna be, one hell of a guy

[KiD CuDi]
I keep 'em short, sweet, thick and petite
Ridin' alongside in my Cutlass Supreme
I'm from a place where old school's are common (Yup)
gotta explain every time I'm rhymin' I be

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
I be all day rollin' in my whip got my sippin' cup out on the low.
I keep two pretty woman by my side I'm cooler than a pull up wit hoes
And I say...
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is the reason I'm leanin'
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is my my city

[KiD CuDi]
Yup yuppers smile all the time while
I chop it up like Michael Watt's slow talk style
So the girlies can really catch all my accent
and the double O got her own accent
Some niggas sell drugs to provide for they fam
some niggas sell CD's up out they trunk man
Some niggas they go to school for that high learnin'
I play the O'Jays while I'm turnin' lanes
We be on our shift, freakin' black and milds still controllin' the whip
Aint no city like Cleveland, cruisin' wit my bad bitch in the evenin'
You wanna know exactly why I'm this way
Take a trip to the land, swing this way
After the song done ain't much I can say
Cleveland is my city, city
I'll be...

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
I be all day rollin' in my whip got my sippin' cup out on the low.
I keep two pretty woman by my side I'm cooler than a pull up wit hoes
And I say...
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is the reason I'm leanin'
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is my my city</pre>
