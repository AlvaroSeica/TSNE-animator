Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's the return of the black moors with no fez
It's eerie like that documentary on Lisa Lopez
Pentagrams pyramids conspiracies with goat heads
Knock down the levees, knock down the projects
Start another project, build another object
A drive-thru touch screen doctrine for me to digest
Just horses with our blinders on
Drivin by the obvious
Riding by the obvious
Flying by the obvious
Uh huh, regardless who you vote for
if the mind don't grow and the poverty line don't go
But the dope keep coming and the TV keep flashing images of a sports car
Then you bound for a coke war
The meek get clowned by the cope law
The sheep get drowned in the folklore
Then lulled to sleep by Tom Brokaw, mm what a pity
the hope on a politicians tongue never ever trickles down to the city
Yeah, so if a nigga put a presidents mask on
and run up in the bank with a mac saying gimme gimme
I ain't glad at em, but I ain't mad at em...
I ain't mad at em
Look, if anybody ask you who I be
Say a painter with a felt pen who drew ali
I'm like cassius when I blast molasses
Out the ass of the masses
From fulton street mall to gratiot I'm handing out free at last kits
Yo jay, where yo staff at?
Green said you threw it,
Yeah, I outgrew it
Some blog said you blew it
Nigga fuck yo blog
Jigga man said you can't knock the hustle dog
I'm on the same launching pad that shot russell off
That's why I stay dougie you can ask tumbling dice...</pre>
