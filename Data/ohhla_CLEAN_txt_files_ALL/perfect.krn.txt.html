(*talking*)
Can you imagine a place, where all the trials
And tribulations of the world, don't exist ha-ha
It's a real place, but right now it only exists in man's mind
Because the reality of it is that, until the time comes
For you to get there, you can only picture it
So what I wanna do, is give you a sneak preview of it
From my perception, yeah, watch this
 
[K-Rino]
Nothing but happiness, and peace felt daily
A place where your children and babies, can play safely
Where people genuinely, believe in being friendly
No such thing as hatred, and no memory of envy
With no problems to face, every morning when you awaken
You can sleep with doors wide open, and nobody'll break in
Where love's force field, is too solid to be shaken
Where each child grows up to be, great women and great men
No depression or loneliness, and no sad moments
And people full grown, who've never heard of being homeless
Where we manifest our gifts, and no dream is too distant
And there are no hospitals, cause sickness is non existent
And love perpetuates itself, while no child suffers
And treatment of one another, is not based around color
And you'll never hear slander, come from anyone's tongue
And a hundred years old, is still considered young
 
[Hook]
In a perfect world, there would be no pain
In a perfect world, no stress no strain
In a perfect world, we would all be wise
And see the whole world, through God's eyes
In a perfect world, no war no crime
In a perfect world, we would share one mind
In a perfect world, and all we see
Is peace, and real L-O-V-E
 
[K-Rino]
Nations wouldn't verbally, spar with one another
Point out flaws, or seek to go to war with eachother
Each person has a place, and a purpose destined to flourish
No child is ever hurt, or malnourished money is worthless
We learned, in the most spiritually advanced schools
And everything is done God's way, no man made rules
And poverty, is no longer in man's vocabulary
Erased from human thought, recollection or dictionary
No dream, the most wonderful thing you've ever seen
Every living being gleaming, with infinite self esteem
And belief in the all wise, ruler and best planner
We walk the planet, in the most harmonious manner
Where those who rest and hid, get uncountable blessings
Total strangers are trustworthy, with your most prized posessions
If a man gives his word, he keeps it with no deception
And a mind full of knowledge, is the only loaded weapon
 
[Hook]
 
[K-Rino]
Is this heaven or the hereafter, the geographical area post rapture
The book of life's unclear chapter
If it's in the sky, then who derrived it
Find someone who's ever died and visualized it, and returned here to describe it
Since none, have carried out that mission
The question isn't if it's real, the question is is it a place or a condition
See heaven, has a great description
But men exaturate and create division, make up written lies and fabricate depictions
So stop imagining, and understand the basics
Your place been in a heavenly state, is self created
That old statement life is what you make it, is a true one
Your old existence erase it, and replace it with a new one
See years of resentment, left your progress restricted
New love can never move into your heart, till hate's evicted
And this place, that I've pictured
Look inside if you wondering where is it, you don't have to give your spirit up to visit
