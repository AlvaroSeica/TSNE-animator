[Lil' 1/2 Dead verse]
it's 7:20 am and I'm already awoke
I'm bustin down all my chronic roaches is smoked
I'm hella mad cause I had me a bag but I lost it
or else did I smoke it, or else had to toss it
damn you forget shit fuckin 'round with this shit
but I gotsta have it, my habit's like an addict
I spark the sticky resedue immediately smoked
don't let it gets the best of me I tells my troat
as I stepped out my house and stopped shortin, no loc
I ran back in and I grabbed my 4-4
so I'm 'bout to slide to the side they ride on
and post up them hoes that I can gets my grind on
my mind on nuttin' but my loot today
just coming up and flossin like dukes dekay
fat sack, my strap and I'm rollin
and twelve packs dumpin and I'm smokin on the doja

[Lil' 1/2 Dead chorus 2x]
still rollin and that's a fact
that nigga Half Dead and young Quicc Ta Mac (well allright)
still rollin and you know that's right
two B.G.'s from the.. eas-eastside

[Quick Ta Mac verse]
well the friday just hit and it's twelve o'clock
I gots my shit about to shot must stay T top
Karl motherfuckin T hooked me up with the bombay
so I gets my floss on, like that, peep the disflact
the summer's poppin and I'm gon be niggaz knockin (why)
'cause jealous motherfuckers talk shit when they see you clockin
but that ain't shit 'cause that's the same niggaz on my dick
who wanna sell with me and bell with me and elevate their grip
the sun is up niggaz deep cloggin up the street
Too Cool hit up the spot with hoes in his backseat
my pants was creased and was faded
you might as well call me Smokey 'cause I'm in by in on friday
too, that Boogaloo got me tweakin (uh huh)
right now I'm chocolate speakin to talkin about this weekend
but you continue to dash up like mincheekin
this nigga Quick this Mike be peepin and have 'em niggaz leapin

[Lil' 1/2 Dead chorus 2x]
still rollin and that's a fact
that nigga Half Dead and young Quicc Ta Mac (well allright)
still rollin and you know that's right
two B.G.'s from the.. eas-eastside

[Lil' 1/2 Dead verse]
I decided to ride with a set-up camp
and put the lick down like a postman staff
wrap around the corner 'cause the cops on hot revenge
'till the end then I drops my rocks on locks
off the hoop 'cause the doobs got near
plus niggaz is seem to see my shit is straight dancin the streets
heat in my pants in case I have to trip
double M with the extra clips
slips never 'cause I always gots my strap and I
never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
in fact, my sack was way off in the cut
and tryna make a sell and the cops pulled up, shucks
I had the ends and the cavvy in my hand
they took me to the station and my bell was too gray
I belled out and my pockets still swollin
and bellin up ocean nigga, and I'm still rollin

[Lil' 1/2 Dead chorus 4x]
still rollin and that's a fact
that nigga Half Dead and young Quicc Ta Mac
still rollin and you know that's right
two B.G.'s from the.. eas-eastside</pre>
