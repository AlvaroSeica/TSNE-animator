Typed by: jarsman@hotmail.com

Chorus 2X
This one goes out to big Duke and sick Jack
Sporty and them Street Platoon vatos sick syde's back
With the type of stuff they bumpin six-duce's and Cadillac's
The type of stuff that even if you ain't smokin it's all that

[Ives]
It's 'bout the most love the most hard most tatted
Most mind scarred most taken for granted
The most underated remain the most creative
Rip rhymes like Bobo bang drums the most faded
See this right here is for those who gon ride
Have my back no matter how many vatos is outside
And yes y'all we got alot of em high
From the East to the West but all the Sick Syde
We down to help B-Real keep the world stoned
That's why smoke spit up out boca and cloud zone
I had a dream that it help the ozone
And also relieve mi tension when not home

Chorus

[Kemo]
Yo delinquentes man yo battle stations neva the fast lane
You know the stye you know the sound you know the name
My lyrics fly like projectiles in many styles
I've been making ends cuz I had to since I was juvenile
Everyday angel everyday Angelino
And everyday I pray my family my homies and primos
Delinquent to what's tight like MC's to teflon
They been wrong my story's long still I'm singin my song
For two days in the Valley shows got rocked non-stop
Delinquente seleccion Sick Syde Realm Psyclone
The venue nicely packed the crowd got blown back
The chips was nicely stacked hats off to all them cats
