[Intro: Solomon Childs]
It's getting crazy out here, son, word
I don't know if I'm coming or going, nowadays
Word... yo...

[Solomon Childs]
Knowledge knowledge, peace
Justice or war, commercialized, or criminalized hardcore
Selling crack out of funeral halls, raised up in group home
My aunt sister thrillogy reads on gold tombstones
Police can't change my money plans
Whether legal or got a poor chrome
Got to stay focused, my tomboys are getting grown
They say the government clones, but I ain't scared of you clowns
I'm a man, now, times are straight hell for some
Orange alert, death in the kingdom, man made symptoms
Bury within the system, you living in war
But my kid's mother wants my daughter's to rock Baby Phat by Kimora
Crooked real estates, throwing up fake fire doors
And I asked where's the book stores, for the young who gon' lead the Forbes
Who gon' decide judgment, and criminal in supreme court
Send suppor to the troops, fuck Timberland and the diesel
I want infered cannons and military scopes
Colombian jungle bush bulletproof coats
This time it's Jones &amp; Tarver three
When I wake 'em up off the ropes...

[Chorus: sample w/ ad-libs]
It's been soooooo.... longgggggggg, longgggggggg
It's been soooooo.... longgggggggg, oh

[Solomon Childs]
Born to rule in revelations, great armies of fallen stages
Alarm lazers on the floor in grocery stores
The national guard could never stop the pure white snow
Color of a clean road, at the popes
All those times are hard, I shall cope
Hope I square, til I choke on poverty's death rope
But I'm as beautiful as the grand canyon
No fake tanning, God make, tailor made
Although we living inside and sign up, nigga moral
We as a people, we were designed to shine with aura
We was designed to shine with order
Or make the track cry like a family for the blood of a soldier
Straight violent, but I love my hood
It ain't as bad as it show, it's like the movie Warriors and you made it home
Where the gorillas and lions roam, and then we took it back home

[Chorus]</pre>
