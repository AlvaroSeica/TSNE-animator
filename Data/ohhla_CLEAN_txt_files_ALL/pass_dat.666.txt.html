Man, last night man
I was kickin' wit' this bitch last night man
The bitch was so fuckin' fine man

(Frayser Boy, talking)
Man, I don't even wanna hear this bullshit
Man, you needa pass that motherfuckin' blunt
You holdin' it all
You been holdin' on to this motherfucka
for damn near twenty minutes

(Guy)
But man, but man thats just what I'm talkin' bout man
The bitch was just fine as hell
She did me in, man

(Frasyer Boy)
Man fuck that, a playa don't wanna hear this shit
Bout you or the bitch
Man, another thang dogg
You originator for these ho's
Keep it my nig, ya know I'm sayin'?
You needa cut this shit short
You know I'm sayin'?
Pass that motherucka

(Hook, Crunchy Blac)
Why you sittin' there babysittin'
Conversatin' with the weed?

(DJ Paul)

Nigga, pass that shit!

(Crunchy Blac)
Man, you fuckin' the rotation up
Just pass the shit to me

(DJ Paul)
Pass that shit!
Nigga, pass that shit!

(Verse 1, Frayser Boy)
It's puff puff, pass
The rules, they still the same
You need to pass the weed dogg
You holdin' up the train
Done held the blunt so long
It's gettin' kinda small
The next blunt that gets rolled
Bruh, you won't hit it at all
Ain't put a dime on shit
Nothin' but lips and finger-tips
Dogg, contribute to the session mang
Or you gon' have to dip
And go get in ya whip
And lead y'all somewhere else
Shoulda smashed behind yo partner, bruh
He already left

(Verse 2, Crunchy Blac)
Yeah, I smoke weed
That good-good dope
But I hate when niggas be
Babysittin' that dope
Yeah, I drink yo purple
And rolled up Sweets
Take me two puffs
Then I pass that weed
But remember we on purple
So we fall to fuckin' sleep
So I yelled at my nigga
"Pass me that green"
Don't make me put my foot in yo
Ass knee-deep
Just do what the song say, nigga
Pass that weed

(Hook, Crunchy Blac)
Why you sittin' there babysittin'
Conversatin' with the weed?

(DJ Paul)

Just pass the shit to me

(DJ Paul)
Pass that shit!

(Crunchy Blac)

When I put half up on them trees?

(DJ Paul)

Nigga, pass that shit!

(Crunchy Blac)
I see you one of them niggas
That be tryina smoke for free

(DJ Paul)
Pass that shit!
Nigga, pass that shit!

(Verse 3, Lord Infamous)
I can smell it in the air
But where the hell's it comin' from?
Need it badly, can I hit your blunt?
Or simply take a 'gun?
Simply buy's me up the hash
And crumble purple-kushy, yum
Bubble-gum, or honey, yum
Fuck all that man, I want me some
Put the torchy on the dope
Just let me sit and have a smoke
Auto-matic gat, I grab it
Just might have it
It's the choke
Know that you don't know me
Or don't owe me, don't be mean to me
Let a brotha come on over
And hit some of yo greenery

(Verse 4, Lil Wyte)
I'm gettin' tired of smokin' out
Wit' traitors, non-chiefers and conversators
Constantly holdin' on to the weed
While I'm tryina get my vapors
Fuck some papers!
Cigarillos what I like to roll and choke
Babysittin' motherfucka, keep on tokin'
And get yo fingers broke
Pass that shit, I know it's the last hit
Lil Wyte gon' be blasted
Til' I'm hittin' my casket
You a grown man, wrong thang
Tryina hog the dope mang?
You wanna fuck wit' me without passin'?
Just stick to cocaine, bitch!

(Hook, Crunchy Blac)
Why you sittin' there babysittin'
Conversatin' with the weed?

(DJ Paul)

Nigga, pass that shit!

(Crunchy Blac)

Just pass the shit to me

(DJ Paul)
Pass that shit!

(Crunchy Blac)

(Verse 5, DJ Paul)
I'm chillin' wit' my nigga "Get High"
C-H-R-I, S, cause he always keep the best
And we in the woods
And we wish a motherfucka would
Come through, fuckin' off
Cause we on that good
Up all night, this cain's up off Louisiana
Wit' them guns beside us
We starin' at them cameras
Steady smokin', watchin' porn on the flat-screen
With some bunnys from the platinum
In my main ching

(Verse 6, Juicy J)
I'm on that weed
And that Red-Bull and alcohol
That get'chu hype (Or slow you doooowwwwnn)
It's like a speed-ball
But I can't stand when a nigga wanna roll it
Then, (Two times,(Coughing), and hold it
Hurry up and pass it
Before you get your ass kicked
I got a ounce of weed
But'chu ain't reachin' in my plastic
It's sticky more than Taffy
It's finer than miss Halley, Berry
Call it blue-berry
I need some commisaries

(Hook, Crunchy Blac)
Why you sittin' there babysittin'
Conversatin' with the weed?

(DJ Paul)
Pass that shit!
Nigga, pass that shit!

(Crunchy Blac)
Man, you fuckin' the rotation up
Just pass the shit to me

(DJ Paul)
Pass that shit!
Nigga, pass that shit!

(Crunchy Blac)

When I put half up on them trees?

(DJ Paul)
