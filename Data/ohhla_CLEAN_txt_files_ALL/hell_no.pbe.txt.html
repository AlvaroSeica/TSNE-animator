People are dying..
They don't have homes..
They don't have jobs..
The city of New Orleans will never be the same
Now let's get off your asses and let's do something
and let's fix the biggest goddamn crisis in the history of this country

Guess it gotta come down to this..
In order to see things for what they are and what they is..
We still may not be free up in this piece or treated very equally as
far as I can see.. now if you saw what I saw
And see what I see on the TV that lead me to write this song
after talking to my father..
But the anger in this song seem to write it's damn self...
Hell No We Ain't Alright
(It's your boy Son of a Bush. Hahaha.)

Now all these press conferences and breaking news alert [this just in]
While your government looks for a war to win..
Claim for the blame game, names where I begin
Walls closin, need to get some help to my kin
While the rest of this Bush nation stands
the drama unfolds as we the people under the stand
Fifty percent of this Son of a Bush nation
is like hatin on hatin aspect of assassination
Ask Pat Robinson, quiz him
[Smells like terrorism]
Racism in the news, still one sided views..
Sayin whites find food
Pray for the National Guard who be ready to shoot
because they be sayin us blacks loot

New Orleans in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no! Hell no. We Ain't Alright!)
New Orleans in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no! Hell no. We Ain't Alright!)
New Orleans in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no! Hell no. We Ain't Alright!)
New Orleans in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no!) Damn damn..
"Neva bada than" - <bring noise="" the="">

Now them violence is quick, tsunamis, I don't mean to scare
Wasn't this written somewhere?
Disgraces, all I been seein is hurtin black faces
Moved out to harm in far away places
[Emergency] statements, corpses, alligators, and snakes
Big difference between this haze and [the little diamonds on the VMAs]
Betta look what's really important, y'all under the sun
Especially if you are over 21
(This ain't no TV show) ain't no video (this is really real!)
Y'all hearin the same old keep it real
Posin for TV stars, havin big rim cars
[But these streets be bloody, b] no matter where you at no gas
Driving a luxury (urgency)
Don't y'all know? (It's in a state of emergency)
Show somebody's government is far from reality
Somebody's government is far from reality!

New Orleans in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no! Hell no. We Ain't Alright!)
New Orleans in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no! Hell no. We Ain't Alright! We got a problem.)
New Orleans in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no! Hell no. We Ain't Alright!)
New Orleans in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no!)

And they don't have a clue what's going on down there
And I'm like, you gotta be kidding me
This is a natural disaster
Anyway you look at it, it's a tragedy..
It's awful down here, man
God is lookin down on all this
And if they aren't doing everything in their power to save people
They are gonna pay the price
Do you know where I'm coming from?

Now I see we be the new faces of refugees
We ain't even overseas, but stuck here on our knees
Forget the plasma TV, ain't no electricity
New world's upside down and out of order
Shelter? Food? Wassup, [where's the water?]
No answers from disaster, them masses hurtin'
So who the f- we call - Halliburton?
Son of a Bush, how you wanna just trust that cat
to fix shit, when all the help is stuck in Iraq?
Makin war plans, takin more stands than Afghanistan
2,000 soldiers there dyin in the sand..
But that's over there, right? [What's over here?]
Is a noise so loud
That some can't hear
But on TV I can see
Bunches of people
Looking just like me
And they ain't all right
(Wait wait wait wait yo yo what?)

New Orleans in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no! Hell no. We Ain't Alright!)
Mississippi in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no! Hell no. We Ain't Alright!)
Alabama in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no! Hell no. We Ain't Alright!)
USA in the mornin, afternoon, and night
(Hell no! Hell no. We Ain't Alright.)

We definitly ain't alright..
And some of y'all voted for that cat! Son of a Bush..
That's right, what God giveth sometimes your country taketh away
I'mma see y'all at the million man march
Tenth year aniversary of the million man march..
That's right the minutes are gonna drop, and that's right, fahrenheit
Yeah. And many of our people and our organizations are getting
together now in Washington DC
October 16th y'all.... 2005
We had all these issues to talk about, we got more issues to talk
about now y'all
Betta yet, ideas to listen to and spread
Yeah... Comin from Public Enemy. Number one y'all... Public Enemy 2005
Public Enemy 2006. Yeah. Public Enemy 2007
(Let me tell y'all somethin
All of our hearts is out there with y'all, you know what I'm sayin?
And we sendin trucks, we sendin boats, boxes of cans of soup... and everything
Clothes and all of that.. shoes
We donating everything to y'all, you know what I'm saying?
Don't worry, y'all ain't by yourself, you need to know that)</bring></pre>
