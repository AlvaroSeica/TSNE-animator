Artist: The Coup
Album:  Sorry to Bother You
Song:   The Gods of Science
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
Gods of science have spoken
"Grab the wire and choke them"

[Boots Riley]
Hypnotic
The noose is slip-knotted
In a fourth-quarter audit
And pumped through the carotid
Many bought it
Got it in patch, pill, or tonic
Get your credit card
Slot it
And sign it on the dotted
Billionaires have squatted
On the Magna Cum Lauded
Hollered "Take my wallet-
Make the people robotic
Catatonic, or harmonic
With what they've been alotted"
And methodically they plotted
Against those who fought it
Whole cities are haunted
Cuz some money bag nodded
And dropped the thought product
Of a Harvard grad upon it
Dollars turn the table
Boardroom and periodic
Listen to the sonics
Coming through your electronics
You can catalogue it as melodic or atomic
Howsenever, when I bomb it
Molecules turn into solids
Some pray to the Christ
Look to Buddha or Mohammed
Some pray to the crack of a rich man's pocket
The biggest advance was plumbing to the projects
Now the scientific process got hijacked for profits
It flows in the direction that a Silver Spoon prodded
We'll get science for the people
When we run the economics

[Chorus]</pre>
