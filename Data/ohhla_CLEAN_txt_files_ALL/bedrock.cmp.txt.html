[Chorus: Chiba]
Just make the bed rock
Just make the bed rock
Just make the bed rock
Just make the bed rock

[Suede]
Tell me how you want it?
A little rough, S&amp;M chains
The way you like it
Off the highway inside a range
Do you need it?
From the back get liquored and weeded
What's your secrets?
I fulfill 'em and kill 'em with the Dracula
Ivory coast get trapped with mac vernacular
Make the bedrock
Turn a perm to a dreadlock
Make her heart stop
Pawn shop but no wedlock
Just one shot, one night
Get her sprung right

[Chiba]
You a gang-banger or gangbuster
Gangbang dames for the low fame luster
Keep a game-face when I figure-four leg lock
I'm straight, six 'o clock I'm on the dot
Bringing pop lock and b-girl
Turn on your gizmo
Turn it off, I'm here
Heat Chi inferno
Her lip gloss is melted
I'm the godfather of goddesses
I go down
Chi, goddam, the god's gift to ho-town

[Chorus]

[Suede]
Just make the bed rock
At a high frequency
Slide down my sled drop
Drappin' drippin' Hennesey
Dive in the pooza
Lo French-mahogany
One for eye-witness
With two China's massaging me
Pelvic sex rock
Call it sexually larceny
Burning up the headboard
And I call her head-lord
Nasty, religious
She cum in double-digits
My wand is the magic
My tongue makes me the wizard

[Chiba]
Welcome to the bed rock Academy
Knock off the Knockouts
Rockabye Baby is knocked over
And knocked down
Bedroom Bully
Ain't no kidding with the kiddo
Just cause they kitten and they kitty
Is a killer
She like my jawbreaker
She juggle on her jawbone
Juggle it on her jugs
Kama-sutra thug
Playing with a jukebox
Musak-man
Spy-cam on tube top
News at 10
