[Intro: Dungeon Masta]
Yo, yo, Dungeon Masta exclusive, spiritual suicide
Yo, yo, U.K., what? Change the flow, what?
Can't get that new U.K. shit, Brooklyn Zu flow, what?

[Dungeon Masta]
Have you ever went the various mood just's like me
Can't drink and drive, crazy fast, like me
Stand in the crowd and pass gas, like me
Knock a nigga flat on his ass, like me
You people can't stand people, like me
Ya'll run, duck and hide from people, like me
You can't go through with the magnet, like me
Regulate, out of state, stack cake, like me
I'm living out the culture, hit a pack, like me
Blood in the rap, hit a rat, like me
Keep ya eye and stay on point, like me
There ain't no one else, to feel a joint, like me
I love violence, try to wild out, like me
Slap a muthafucka in the mouth, like me
Are they playing with demons, in ya head, like me
Got the ratchet, then spit lead, like me
Most ya cats is on parole, like me
Get violent and for the dough, like me
Catch a new charge, you wanna dodge, like me
Stay on the low, and live large, like me

[Chorus 2X: Dungeon Masta]
Spiritual (suicide), there's not place to run (stay alive)
Now you gonna do, when it's your turn to die?
Spend time with your loved ones (say bye, bye, baby, bye bye)

[Dungeon Masta]
Have you ever got tired of being broke, like me
Go outside and slam, clappin' dough, like me
Don't give a fuck about bitches and hoe, like me
Muthafuckas just can't cope, like me
Scared people wanna talk about, like me
Have you ever did mad drugs, like me
Looking for crack on the run, like me
Are you glad that you're not raw, like me
Don't give a shit about what you think of me
Ain't nothing wrong if you thing like me
What's the purpose, ya'll can make mistake like me
See ya peoples chilling at the wake, like me
Once and while you'll hear a break like me
Pounds and just hit the tape, like me
Went to the carshop, get a cab, like me
Add more people to the stash, like me
Snatch a shorty, take her to the telly, like me
Put sperm all up in the belly, like me
Most of these cats is on parole, like me
Get violated for the dough, like me
Catch a new charge, you wanna dodge, like me
Stay on the low, and live large, like me

[Chorus 3X]</pre>
