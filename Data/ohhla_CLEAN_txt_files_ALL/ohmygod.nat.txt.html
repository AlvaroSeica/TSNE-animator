...yeah,T.N.T's up in this bitch a.k.a. Tony Montana
on the... bitch, yeah, they can't touch me, yeah

[TNT]
Tony Montana, I shot up a body in Atlanta
Dump that bitch in the river it don't matter
Still make moves on the street it don't stop
Still got the connects for the guns and crack rocks
Niggas hate my style cause my style's irregular
Never talk about weed on your Bernie Mack cellular
Connect with E, I got some D on the scale
Niggas been gettin mad since Boomin Words From Hell
And I got that drug parephenalia
Deep down and we affiliated
We often imitated but we're never duplicated
T.N.T you know me, I'm on the east side
And my gat's on my side when it's time to ride

[Esham]
Oh my god, he's got a gun.....Oh my god he's got a gun
(I'm bout to bust yo ass)
Oh my god, he's got a gun......Oh my god, he's got a gun

[T.N.T]
Oh my god he's got a gun so don't be surprised
When I bust this muthafucka right in front of your eyes
So nigga I stay psyched
Cause every dumb nigga that I know out here is strapped
And he'll shoot your ass at the drop of a dime
It's kill or be killed, that's the state of mind
With no worries in they eyes but time for the crime
Cause half these muthafuckas on this planet is blind
Ya see Natas is Satan, I didn't wanna yell it
But N-A-T-A-S is how us niggas spell it
Last time I said Fuck the whole world ya didn't hear me
Now I'm whippin out the mac to make you punk niggas fear me

[Esham]
Oh my god, he's got a gun......Oh my god, he's got a gun
(I'm bout to blast yo ass)
Oh my god, he's got a gun...... Oh my god, he's got a gun</pre>
