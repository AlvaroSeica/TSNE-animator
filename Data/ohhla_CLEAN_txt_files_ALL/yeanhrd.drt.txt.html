[Chorus]
It's that weed, reefa, marijuana, herb down here we call it that wood 
off in tha south YEANHEARD (repeat yeanheard 9 times)

[Big Pimp]
Now it's that weed, reefa, marijuana that got me twisted
Hell we runnin' that wood awfuly somethin' good so we stay blistered 
Off that thunder birdy yac
Dirty rolled dem auctimo's by the pack cuz' they bust so slowly
And credited a sack from Pimpy Small cuz' you know he know me
Hold on now that blunt comin' my way so high you hit it for me
Plus you baby sittin', shit you tryin' to hog all the dope
Nigga stop runnin' off at cho mouth for you run out all this smoke
But yet you wonder why you don't get high yo eyes aint red
You off up in hea hittin' that wood like yo bitch ass scared
You aint no chiefa foreal I peeped yo ass through the rear view mirror
You in the back hittin' that dope like you smokin' a black
And if it aint none of that killa cream then that dope aint no fiah
We roll em' fat like snicker bars and blow that smoke in the sky
And that aint no lie cuz' we some Dirty niggas born to die
Hell I can't tell, it seem to me like we was born to get high
And raise hell off that

[Chorus x 2]

[Mr. G]
I don't know that yall bitches smokin' on in the east and the west
But I know down south shit my niggas smoke the best
We chief that wood wood bitch you know that good good
That greenchy green get cha high off in my hood hood
My eyes be low, my throat be warm, and plus it's half way numb
And if I hit that thing too hard that smoke calapse my lungs
Yall don't feel me, that's that shit my niggas blaze in the Gump
And if you aint hittin' no wood like that you must been smokin' bunk
Now what cha rollin' wit' shit we roll them dudge mastas
We used to smoke them Swisher Sweets, but them bitches run faster
Don't be jealous jockin' me because my wood some skank
Someone puff action smoke one blunt and have the whole house stank
And all that shit they talkin' bout' brah it aint all that it seem
Hell I don't even know why they smokin' that wood it aint all the way green
Know what I mean? Off in the village is where we kept them blunts bunted
Up under the stairs lookin' out to see if security comin'
Cuz' we stay gone off that

[Chours x 2]

[Big Pimp]
It's that green wood that I inhale that got me lost
Movin' slowly nigga hold me before I fall

[Mr. G]
It's that green wood that I inhale that got me lost
Movin' slowly nigga hold me before I fall

[Big Pimp]
It's that green wood that I inhale that got me lost
Movin' slowly nigga hold me before I fall

[Mr. G]
It's that green wood that I inhale that got me lost
Movin' slowly nigga hold me before I fall

[Big Pimp]
It's that green wood that I inhale that got me lost 
Movin' slowly nigga hold me before I fall
