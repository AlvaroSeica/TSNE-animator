Come on

Hooo, yeah..

Uh

Never be the same again

I call you up whenever things go wrong
You're always there you are my shoulder to cry on
I can't believe it took me quite so long
To take the forbidden step
Is this something that I might regret?
Come on, come on
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
You are the one
The lonely heart that can't be tamed
Come on, come on
I'm hoping that you feel the same
This is something that I can't forget

I thought that we would just be friends
Things will never be the same again
It's just the beginning it's not the end
Things will never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore
Now you've opened up the door
Starting tonight and from now on
We'll never, never be the same

(uh, never be the same again)
Never be the same again
(uh, never be the same again, come on)

Now I know that we were close before (before)
I'm glad I realised I need you so much more (yeah)
And I don't care what anyone will say (uh, ha)
It's about you and me (you and me)
And we'll never be the same again (uh)

I thought that we would just be friends (ohh yeah)
Things will never be the same again (things will never be the same again)
It's just the beginning it's not the end (we've only just begun)
Things will never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore
Now we've opened up the door
Starting tonight and from now on
We'll never, never be the same

(never be the same again) aha
Never be the same again
(uh, never be the same again) (aha)

Uh, check it
Night and day
Black beach sand to red clay
The US to UK
NYC to LA
From sidewalks to highways
See it will never be the same, what I'm saying
My mindframe never changed so you can't rearrange
But sometimes it seems completely forbidden
To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden
When there's no competition
And you render my condition
Though improbable it's not impossible
For a love that could be unstoppable, but wait
Fine lines between fate and destiny
Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be?
When you tell me the stories of your quest for me
Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly
And as our energies mix and begin to multiply
Everyday situations they start to simplify
So things will never be the same between you and I
We intertwine our life forces
Are not what you'll find (yeah)

I thought that we would just be friends (come on)
Things will never be the same again
It's just the beginning it's not the end (ooh)
Things will never be the same again
It's not a secret anymore (uh)
Now you've opened up the door (yeah)
Starting tonight and from now on (yeah)
We'll never, never be the same

(Come on) hooo hooooo
Things will never be the same again (yeah)
Aha (uh) never be the same again</pre>
