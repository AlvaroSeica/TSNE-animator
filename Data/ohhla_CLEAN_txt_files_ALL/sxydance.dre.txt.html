Would you like a table dance?

[Repeated in background]
Ah...ah...ah...ah

[Verse 1]
With your tongue, what you did with your tongue
That made me go arising, uh arising yeah
In my memory when you make it up to me
When you were kind of surprising
When you were kind of surprising baby
Yes you were
Now with the best from the West, check the sound [* Explosion *]
It's from the R&amp;B underground
And it's just like the muff
You know that we can't get enough
So come and take a ride with me yeah
Come and take a ride with me
You're riding with me

[Chorus]
Ride with me, come with me
Baby come give, do that sexy dance for me
Let yourself go and get nasty
Lady that sexy dance for me
Let yourself go and get nasty

[Verse 2]
You've got me open baby oh
Cause I'm the mastermind
You know you're looking lovely lady yeah
I wish I could get some of your time
I know that you're the one, you're the one
So do me right
Let's get busy my love
And let me see you dance tonight

[Chorus]
Let yourself go and get nasty
Lady that sexy dance for me
Let yourself go and get nasty
Lady that sexy dance for me
Let yourself go and get nasty
Lady that sexy dance for me
Let yourself go and get nasty

[Verse 3]
Bulging eyes from what I see in my sight
She winding and grinding it
And the body was so tight yeah
There's no fessing, no wishing
I was on a mission to get what I want
Now truthfully I said after the party
Oh Lord got me telling stories like loddy dotty
And now I realize
That I must have been hypnotized
By your world true silky thighs
And now lady why don't you sexy dance for me

[Chorus]

You looking good to me sweet mama - Sexy dancer
Want your body, want your body - Sexy dancer
Do that sexy dance - Sexy dancer
Want your body, want your body - Sexy dancer
Do that sexy dance - Sexy dancer
Want your body, want your body - Sexy dancer
Do that sexy dance - Sexy dancer
Want your body, want your body - Sexy dancer
Do that sexy dance</pre>
