[Young Mav]		
Every man, woman, and child is a custy
They cop my stock while y'all stay dusty
Taking up space, offer rebates
And you might see gold by 2008
Sorry cadet, I can't take your cassette
I'm allergic to garbage, stay where you are kid
Up your game if you want the thrown
With less rhymes bout hoes or clothes
Two ears, one mouth, use in proportion
Free advice, but some dudes can't afford it
Too many MC's flunked they classes
That's why we hear more hits than classics
I'm a child prodigy, like Doogie Howser
You're a wack freestyler like that dreadlock Bowser
Don't remember, I didn't think you would
And they won't remember you, cause you're not that good

[Chorus  1X]
You love to hear the story again and again 
About these fly cats from the MFM 
Just three young brothers who be dropping them gem's 
Fat beats on a lyrical blend 
You love to hear the story again and again 
About these fly brothers from the MFM
Just three young cats who be dropping them gem's 
Well this is where the story begins

[Bigga Nolte]	
You ask how important can we be
We took "E"Lympia to seven on MTV
But since simple minds, missed simple lines
Let me dumb it down make it simpler this time
Since day one, we be up in our status
We turned a hobby into Music For Mavericks
We doing big tings, yes we looking for cash kid
And there's nothing you could do to hold the Mavericks
Just stop, and watch what you're doing
Confused and you wonder why your units ain't moving
You say you is hot got rhymes galore
When you was just like Chris from CB4
Now you gone see me score to win the championship
We on top there's no way we gone quit
It's over now so Arlo just pop the Cris
As boast, make a toast, and our glasses hit

[Chorus  1X]
You love to hear the story again and again 
About these fly cats from the MFM 
Just three young brothers who be dropping them gem's 
Fat beats on a lyrical blend 
You love to hear the story again and again 
About these fly brothers from the MFM
Just three young cats who be dropping them gem's 
Well this is where the story begins

[Dirt Gritie] 		
You love to hear the story I'll tell it again
About this fly brother from the MFM 
No chip tooth smile so when he smiles at them 
All the girls smile back cause they vibe with him
But to get a clear view brothers lie to him 
Give him prop's when he knows they despise the man 
Still he's not ignorant all moves deliberate 
Stay on top the game and change like the elements 
Yep, that's earth, wind and fire 
No watered down flow so what's your desire 
Push the button he's taking you higher 
Oh yes, in the top 5 of "E"lympia's best  
I'm like Rick James bitch so what you expect 
I'm trying to make change by collecting my sense 
Picture a brother that's real yo 
A story best told from the ego 

[Chorus  1X]
You love to hear the story again and again 
About these fly cats from the MFM 
Just three young brothers who be dropping them gem's 
Fat beats on a lyrical blend 
You love to hear the story again and again 
About these fly brothers from the MFM
Just three young cats who be dropping them gem's 
Well this is where the story begins</pre>
