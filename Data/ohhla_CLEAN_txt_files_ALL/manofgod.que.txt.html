[Intro: Bill Maher]
When the current Pope was in his previous Vatican job
he wrote a letter instructing every Catholic bishop
to keep the sex abuse of minors secret until the statute of limitations ran out

[Verse 1]
They had high hopes for the little boy
Started with a Catholic baptism for their pride and joy
As the priest puts holy water on his tiny forehead life becomes grimy and morbid
The parents wanted their child on the right path
Dedicated church-goers at the Sunday night mass
Unaware within the cathedral beneath you
Steeple that baby boy would be within the reach of evil
The devils in the man who lusts the young body
Its sacrilege, demonic, unjust, and ungodly
Who knows why God lets these things happen?
Or is the free will of man that gets his soul trapped in?
Seven years later hes a Catholic school student
Taking the bread and the wine, the first act of communion
The priest watch from the darkness of his mind
Premeditated rape, the heartless grin of a crime

[Chorus]
In the name of the Father, deliver the Son
In the name of the Father, embrace the Son
In the name of the Father, forsake the Son
A victim straight to the man of God

In the name of the Father, deliver the Son
In the name of the Father, embrace the Son
In the name of the Father, forsake the Son
Deceived, raped by the man of God

[Verse 2]
A tear falls down his innocent eye
Left alone in a place where innocence dies
In the shadows no one could witness the crime
Now hes wishing his life would finish and die
A child held tight in Satans clutch
And the soap wont wash away his touch
Wishing he was born twisted and blind
The secret hidden behind door number 6 in his mind
His fathers ashamed and his mother hurts
While they move this sick fuck to another church
An act of vengeance has got to be for the throat
Fuck a worthless apology from the Pope
The soul of a dark child is now a grown man
With a gun taking justice in his own hands
God the priest can use a touch of faith now
Cause he pulled the trigger and blew his fucking brains out

[Chorus]</pre>
