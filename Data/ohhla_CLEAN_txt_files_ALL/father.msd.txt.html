Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I spent 23 years trying to be what you wanted me to be
Though it seemed like you couldn't save me
'Til I picked up the mic and I was on the TV
Now you're ringing off my phone like every week

Where were you at 6, 7, 11 and 13
When shit was impossible
Mama left nine months pregnant
But she came home alone from the hospital

How could you call yourself a man
If you can't love your own unless you can control them
You'd rather destroy their souls and she was 13 years old
And you could've protected the innocence from being stolen

And I don't give a damn what you was going through
When mama wasn't able to put food on the table
You left the family unstable
Now you come around acting like you want some kind of appraisal

You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit 'cause you weren't around
And you can't get mad but what can you do?
You can't tell me shit, I'm grown without you

I spent 23 years trying to be the fucking man you should be
Taking care of your responsibility
Putting clothes on our back and shoes on our feet, no help
But you always had your bag of weed

Where were you at 12, 13, 14 and 15
When life was unliveable, momma was so damn angry
The way she treated me was unforgivable

You call yourself a man, your oldest son
He had to learn from his sister how to put a nigger's fist up
How to fuck a nigger's shit up and knock out any motherfucker
That had come and tried to diss us

And I don't give a damn what you was going through
And I needed saving, I spent my every second blazing
A little girl with a blade and trying to fuck up
And take my life just wanted to dig my grave and

You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit 'cause you weren't around
And you can't get mad but what can you do?
(Now what you gonna do?)
You can't tell me shit, I'm grown without you

You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit 'cause you weren't around
And you can't get mad but what can you do?
(You can't do a damn thing)
You can't tell me shit, I'm grown without you
I'm grown without you, I've grown without you
Can't, can't come and come and tell me, do not</pre>
