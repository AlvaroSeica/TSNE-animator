[Intro: Drake]
Yeah... (yo, it's The Aphilliates nigga, pay attention)
Nicki Minaj, Young Money
Yeah... Jersey's home baby (Holiday Season!!)

[Chorus One: Drake - singing]
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it 
You be up on e'rything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down, everytime I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin best (ay) you the fuckin best (ay)
You the fuckin best (ay) you the fuckin best (ay)
You the best I ever (ay) best I ever had (ay)
Best I ever had (ay) best I ever had
I say you the fuckin best

[Drake]
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there
(Yeah!) I'll be over there, shorty I'll be over there
I'll be hittin all the spots that you ain't even know iw there
Ha~! And y'all don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants hair tied chillin with no makeup on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringin Drake along
You know that I'm workin I'll be there soon as I make it hooommmme
And she a patient in my waitin room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
.. And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with cause

[Chorus One]

[Nicki Minaj]
Aiyyo you da only one that see the real Nicki
I can show you chill Nicki cause of how you deal with me
When they knock my blocks down, you come and you build with me
Even though you real busy, youse the fuckin real, Drizzy
("Trapaholics!") It's so amazing
I figured out this world is ours for the tak-ing
I figured out that when I go out and those people scream
That some of them only think vicariously through me
That's why I put that S on my chest and I'm gone
But on another note let's have sex in my dorm
And I'ma make you beg cause you look pretty when you beggin
So meet me on the campus I'll be there around 11
Just let me put my books, down
Excuse me if I look, down
Guess I'm a little nervous, but I let you service
Look at what you took, down

[Chorus Two: Nicki Minaj] + (Drake)
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everythang, other niggaz never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
That's how I hold you down, every time you hit me up
When I get right I promise that we gon' live it up
I make you beg for it, until I give it up
You say the same thing every single time
(I say you the fuckin best - ay, you the fuckin best - ay)
(You the fuckin best - ay, you the fuckin best - ay)
(You the best I ever - ay, best I ever had - ay)
(Best I ever had - ay, best I ever had)
(I say you the fuckin best)

[Drake]
+Sex, Love, Pain+ baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggaz'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial 
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make yo' pussy whiiis-tle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
.. And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin for a fix then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin bra strap pop
All up in ya slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm sayin

[Chorus One]

[Drake]
I say you the fuckin best (ay) you the fuckin best (ay)
You the fuckin best (ay) you the fuckin best (ay)
You the best I ever (ay) best I ever had (ay)
Best I ever had (ay) best I ever had...
Uh! Ah yeah!
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money {BABY!!}
Yeah, yeah...</pre>
