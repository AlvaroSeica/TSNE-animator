This is a mission not a small time thing
Got me on the case like I'm Sherlock, Holmes
My dome kinda messed up from what I've been seein
and what I've been hearin, got me not knowin what to believe in
I was breezin, battlin bosses
The record is flawless, zero losses
'Til I came across this, stunning young piece
who resided at the bottom of the sea - and she
told me her name was Splash Woman
Beautiful but deadly, she was mad cunning
Had a voice that could soothe the savage
beast, her physique was way above average
Magic the way she got me in a spell
Got me on lockdown, sort of like a cell
But I got a mission that I can't afford to fail
My girl, I got a secret to tell, umm...
I don't know how to say this
So I'ma just say it, that you my favorite
Even underwater I'm enchanted by your fragrance
You're the one to play with, won't you, be my baby?
Or maybe, we can get up out of this land
and maybe get a bite somewhere my dear
Even though she knew the truth about Ran
I had a feeling she would understand, yo I got a chance

[Chorus: Random]
Thought I was in love before
But I love you more, so baby come aboard
And go away with me, so I can make you see
What you mean to me, and baby we can be
Free... oh ohhhhh, under the sea
Oh ohhhhh, just you and me

Seem like every couple years I get that feeling
Feelin like I'm about to hit that ceiling
But I cain't cause it's time for spikes
And when I reach the lair I know it's time to fight
I couldn't do it, Punk'd out like Ashton's victims
She started singin and I had to listen
It was lovely, when she sang, the fish came
All of a sudden the mission changed, insane~!
She told me about her true purpose
She was a state victim that fell through the surface
A few days ago the contract expired
And she was scheduled to be thrown into the fire
And Wily gave her a reason to live
So now she gotta do what he says
She said a tear and said you don't understand
I gotta stick to the plan, I owe everything to this man
So please Mega Ran, don't take it personal
Cause it hurts I know, I'll make it worse y'know
But he saved me baby
To turn my back on Wily would be just plain crazy
She said it's the only way it can end
Let the, battle begin and we can't be friends
So my heart sunk low as the lair door closed
Drew the Mega Buster cause it's time to roll, here we go

[Chorus]

[Random]
So the battle was on, it was fierce
She hit me in the side and left my armor pierced
On her command, the fishes attacked me
I cocked the Mega Buster and hit 'em exactly
But the battle took a turn that was odd
Every time I fired a shot, she didn't dodge
She took each blast from the arm cannon
Smiled at me as every shot was landin
At first I didn't know what she was plannin
Then suddenly I started understandin
Yo I think she lettin me win
Givin me what I need so I can get to the end
By the 17th hit she began to stagger
Fell to the ground so I ran and grabbed her
Looked up in her eyes as she tried to laugh
Pulled me close and handed me her staff
I said I wish it didn't have to be like this
I'm thinkin he might miss her if she be my miss
She said don't be foolish, you gotta do this
Let the whole city know what the truth is
Said boy you got stuff to do
Said girl I woulda gave it all up for you
I feel invincible when I'm holdin you
But as far as love goes I'm 0-for-2

[Chorus]</pre>
