[Hook - 2x]
Swanging, swanging
84's adapters, we throwed we cappers
Swanging, swanging
Whether chrome or gold, 24's we roll

[Tite]
I'm in that Bentley drop, black with the lacquer top
Paint sweating like it's hot, wheels refuse to stop
Hoes love Chalie and Tite, like Brian McKnight
24's on the shine, looking larger than life
We rap stars for real, with big cars and wheels
Haters try to pull us down, so we tuck in the steal
That's the way we ride, with big Texas pride
Plex denied, catch us in a Lexus ride
24's and spinners, diamond grill we grinners
Sometimes we sinners, at all times we winners
I got's to have it, with V-12 kick back
Then sit back, while this young cat spit that
I got's to do my thang, hit the block and slang
I gotta come up and stang, so 24's I swang
It's the D-3 nut, Chalie Boy what's up
Get in the truck, 24's kicking up dust

[Hook - 2x]

[Chalie Boy]
It's the Summer time
So I'ma pull, out the dropper-eeer
Which one do I choose
The Lac's off or the Benz, hard topper
Sitting popper, on my 24's
On my favorite, the 84's
Screens on, flicks being shown
As I'm pissing off the shady homes
I'm a trunk breaker, certified show shaker
All the rims I found, why why
They certified Omega
Spre's on the Hummer
Labs on the Benz, in the winter
My series coming soon, my life
Called the versatile now, when you see me I'm

[Hook - 2x]

[Chalie Boy]
From a big body Benz
To a 18 wheeler-eeer
Riding on soul
I'm a scratch four killa
My rims chop, like a tenor
From Line Hars, to Devin's
Whatever style's, good dude
Believe, that's what I'm having
Wood wheel grabbing, hogging up the lane
With all my G's
The middle, on Spre's
No less than two door fairs, on glass 3's
It's easy to see
For us, it ain't no tha-aaang
If you got it, like we do
Then let me see you swang, let me see you swang

[Tite]
I'm fin to cut dog, but let's keep it understood y'all
I'm peanut butter, swanging wood y'all
It's 22's and Perelli's, in the summer time
I'm in front the line, balling like a bunch of times
Gotta shine, every Sunday
In the line going one way, traffic like it's Monday
And it's a fun day, slabed out banging
We hot boys with block toys, and we swanging
