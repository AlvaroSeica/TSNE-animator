[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
To all my enemies I know you hear this, FUCK YOU!
I hope your son's retarded and your daughter is buck tooth
Hope your Moms is hit by a truck too
But I don't have to hope, cause allah guarantees you your just due
You aint shit, you must be eatin' paint chips
You just a makeshift bitch, you need maintenance
I need patients, I'll put you on the waitin' list
I got a stainless I can sanctify satan with
I got a brain that I break the fuckin' matrix with
I am greatness, I kill a billion Agent Smiths
Supreme authority over the universe
Top priority, God created Black Man first
Lastly was the grafted devil wicked and powerless
Your heart is 100% cowardess
Your brain is 85% cloudiness
Every bone in your body is infected by parelles

[chorus] - 2X
-This is for y'all
You get high with your last bill
-This is for y'all
You live and die for/by Allah's will
-This is for y'all
Feel the same way I feel
-This is for y'all
Yo
-This is for y'all
Yo
-This is for y'all

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
I'm a sin for life go to hell with an invite
My knife slices red pinstripes across windpipes
Fine line between fear and love leaving thugs pierced by the slug
Your body cries tears of blood
Stitching your limbs while I'm pulling on the L stems
Allahs glow burns your skin like hells wind
Sends iron pins through your eyelids
You'll be a blind motherfucker lookin for revenge
Niggaz too deaf to hear the sirens
we dressed in gear for rioting
Come test me, I'm firing
Leave your mug cracked you're tough black
bullets need blood, and you're the only donor that match
Latch the gate before the God snatches your plate
With twin barrells starin' at you like an infinite 8
Reciting the vows of hate
on a irrespectus? wild and wreckless
I'm blessing you with your death wish

[chorus] - 2X
-This is for y'all
You get high with your last bill
-This is for y'all
You live and die for/by Allah's will
-This is for y'all
Feel the same way I feel
-This is for y'all
Yo
-This is for y'all
Yo
-This is for y'all

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
Army of the measure
My brain is a locked  box of treasure
We opposite, your pain is my pleasure
Smackin' your protector, chill in my sector
Mind of Malcolm, on his way back from Mecca
Burn sess up, step up had a gut
Niggaz stretched on their backs with their arms and legs up
Put X's over your eyes, fallen into darkening skies
You talkin in cries, chalck tracin over your sides
Facing the wise, I taste ???, the Ties rise
Split aside, the time dies
2000 and 5, I derserve praisure
Invade ya, heartless like the blue blazer
Introducer, into hell, we recruit ya
The vet I collect on debt for lucipher
Blood papers, I don't grate 'em, I just bake 'em
Tombstones, we don't make 'em, we just date 'em

[chorus] - 2X
-This is for y'all
You get high with your last bill
-This is for y'all
You live and die for/by Allah's will
-This is for y'all
Feel the same way I feel
-This is for y'all
Yo
-This is for y'all
Yo
-This is for y'all
