[Verse 1: Anthony Sheehan (Jah Free in background)]
I still remember the first time we met
At the mall, lookin' at me, pretty and set
I said, "Hi," really nervous, you were making me sweat
You replied, saying something that I couldn't forget
Right then, I was ready and I knew I was right
You switched numbers, next day, you was spendin' the night
Somethin' very opposite of what an ending is like
My whole life, I been wrong, so this gotta be right
That's why the love that we have was just made to be true (Oh)
Cause no one has ever made me feel the way that you do (Girl)
Nobody's ever made me cry just by sayin' they love me (Girl, girl, girl)
Knew
No one in this world, girl, nobody but you
But that's for real

Chorus: Jah Free
Baby
I know I got you crying
I see you give it up
But I swear to God, I'm trying
So please don't walk away
Just give me one try
I want you to stay
I need you in my life
Please girl, don't you, leave

[Jah Free]  Don't leave
            Don't leave
            Girl, don't you leave
            Don't leave
            Don't leave
[Fingazz]   "Do-do, do, do-don't you leave" --&gt; Jah Free
[Jah Free]  Don't leave
            Don't leave
            Girl, don't you leave
            Don't leave
[Brown Boy] Brown Boy
[Jah Free]  Don't leave
[Brown Boy] You already know what it is

[Verse 2: Brown Boy {Jah Free in background}]
From the first time, girl, that I looked at you (Uh hun)
I knew that second, I was hooked on you {Yeah}
The question was, would my heart stay true (What)
Now I know the answer cause she sad and blue
Should've never cheat, should've never lie
Never meant to hurt you, make you cry
Do anything, baby, for another try (One more)
Give it all up, just to take away the pain
I promise you, ma
No more games
I done with it all
The women and the fame {Girl}
If I ain't got you, then it ain't the same
I'm down on my knees
Please don't leave {Yeah}

Repeat Chorus

Hook:
[Jah Free]  Don't leave
            Don't leave
            Girl, don't you leave
            Don't leave
            Don't leave
[Fingazz]   "Do-do, do, do-don't you leave" --&gt; Jah Free

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3: Anthony Sheehan (Jah Free in background)]
Girl, I know, I've been wrong, but I'm tryin' to be right
Tryin' to stop arguin', tryin' to stop, with the fights
See, doin' you wrong, was my biggest mistake
Cause I never once found a way to turn in my fate (Baby)
But you can't turn around and forget all the rest (Girl)
How I always made you happy when I gave in my best
I'll never stop a thing to just give it a rest
Cause whenever I'm without you, girl, I'm livin' a mess
And I know inside that there isn't a question
How my life
Made it better (Ah, yeah)
Yeah
And I know being with you is a blessin'
That is why, I would love you forever
So don't leave (Don't leave)

Repeat Chorus
