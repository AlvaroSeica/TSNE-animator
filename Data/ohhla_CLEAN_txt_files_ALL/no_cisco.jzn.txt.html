Warning, the Surgeon General, has determined

[Chief Chinchilla]
Drinkin that Cisco'll put you on yo' ass, so don't touch it!

[Farmers Blvd. Liqua Sto Quartet singing]
I walked up in the disco (these hoes wanna dance)
The place was full of hoes (look at these bitches in here)
And they were drinking Cisco (Cisco)
And takin off their clothes (bitch dropped them drawers)
This one girl lookin frisky (frisky)
I bought the bitch a cup (ain't no trickin in here)
But before she could lick me (lick me)
The bitch was throwin up (you nasty bitch)

[Chorus] + (Chinchilla)
Everybody out there (EVERYBODY)
Stay away from Cisco (STAY AWAY)
Drink it and you may wind up dead
(Drink it and you may wind up dead)
Have yourself a soda (SODA)
Or rum &amp; Coca-Cola (rum &amp; Coke)
Better yet stay sober instead
(Better yet, stay sober instead~!)

[Chief Chinchilla]
