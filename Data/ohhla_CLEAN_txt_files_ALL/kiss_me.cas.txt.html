Song:   Kiss Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

One touch can bring us closer
Don't want this to be over
You know that you complete me
Your love is what I need
Don't rush to see you leaving
Stay with me while I'm sleeping
Cuz you know what you do to me
I'm weak and you know my heart is beating

[B-section]
One, two, three, kiss, that's when I know that we
Four, five, six, kiss, have the right chemistry
You don't have to hold back or be shy
I can feel you want me in your eyes
One, two, three, kiss, that's when I know that we
Four, five, six, kiss, have the right chemistry
Feels so good cuz I know that you're mine
Boy I got my eyes closed cuz you know that I

[Chorus]
Love it when you kiss me
Love it when our lips meet
You intoxicate me
I barely can breathe
I love when you kiss me [2x]

Ooh girl I'm coming over
You know I wanna hold ya
Kiss you, cuz I know you want me too
I want to give you what you'll like
So, so please don't be afraid to
To tell me what'll make you
Reach the top (reach the top)
Girl I'm needing it
Cuz baby I can feel your heart beating

[B-section]

[Chorus]

[Break]

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
