[Intro: Ice-T]
No, no, no, no, Mommaaaaa!!!!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
All my life I loved this girl so much
All my life I loved her simple touch
She cared for me and put me on this earth
All the pain of just a simple birth
But now I found that she has left me dumb and blind
Poisoned, twisted and destroyed my mind!
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race, that's why I hate you!
There's only one way I can make it right, momma's gotta die tonight!!
There's only one way I can make it right, momma's gotta die tonight!!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Momma, momma, I always loved my momma, I always loved my momma
I loved the way she hold me, I love the way she talked to me
She used to teach me a lot of things
She taught me good things, she taught me bad things
("Don't trust white people, don't trust white people")
Don't trust white people, they're no good, they're no good
they're no good, they're no good
They're just gonna rip you off, they're just gonna rip you off
Don't trust them, don't trust them
I said: Why momma?
She said: ("I told you don't trust them, they're no good")
I said: Momma, I thought we were all the same, momma, why momma?
She said: ("Don't ask me any questions, don't you challenge your mother")
Momma, so one day, I found I fell in love
And I brought my girlfriend home, and I introduced her to my mother 
And she smacked me ~ was a white girl 
And I said: Why momma? Why momma? What did I do wrong?
You know.. I found out my mother was an evil woman
She hated Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Jamaicans, Indians, Orientals
Momma was no good, I learned to hate my mother, hate my mother
So I got some.. ha ha, some lighter fluid, from the corner store
And I put it around her bed, and I set her on fire! 
Ha, ha, ha.. burn momma, burn momma, burn momma, burn bitch
Burn, burn, burrrrrn.. ha, ha, ha.. 
Burn, you racist bitch! ha, ha, ha.. 

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
But she wasn't quite dead, she jumped up from the bed
and I grabbed my Louisville Slugger 
That she had bought me for my twelfth birthday 
And I came up behind her and I hit her
I hit her, I hit her twice, ha, ha, ha.. now she was out
Ha.. I went into the kitchen and I got that handy carving knife
That we only use on special occasions; like bullshit Thanksgiving
And I took her and I laid her old fucked up corpse on the floor 
And I cut her in little bitty pieces
Cut off her arms, her feet, her neck, and I put her into little green hefty bags
And I put it into my car and I said: 
Momma, we're going on a vacation, a permanent vacation bitch
I took some of her around the world to Arizona
New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Miami, Oakland, Ha, ha, ha.. 
Yo, you wanna go to Connecticut, bitch
Ohio, Detroit, Texas, L.A.
Whose laughing now momma; whose laughing now, bitch?
Whose laughing now? ha, ha, ha, ha.. ha, ha, ha, ha..

[Interlude: Ice-T]
So if you got a mother or a grandmother or a father
Who wants to carry on the same racist bullshit 
That's fucked this world up from day one; you can either 
Look them in the face and tell them to suck your dick 
Or do like Body Count does!!

[Chorus: Ice-T]
All my life I loved this girl so much
All my life I loved her simple touch
She cared for me and put me on this earth
All the pain of just a simple birth
But now I found that she has left me dumb and blind
Poisoned, twisted and destroyed my mind!
She taught me things that simply were not true
She taught me hate for race, that's why I hate you!
There's only one way I can make it right, momma's gotta die tonight!!
There's only one way I can make it right, momma's gotta die tonight!!</pre>
