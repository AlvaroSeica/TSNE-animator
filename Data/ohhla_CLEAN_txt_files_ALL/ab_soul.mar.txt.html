[Ab-Soul]
I gave her my heart, she gave me hers too
This exposition the definition of true
I knew her for years, she knew me too
As if our souls influenced this pursuit
Beginning as children forgetting we grew
Just an analogy for how the time flew
Inseparable, two peas in the pod
Runnin through my mind like, every two minutes top
In the backseat doin what we do at the spot
Heared a "ooh" when I hit ya spot, head hit the roof~!
Young lovers under the moon, it's cool but it's hot
Nails in my back, exhaling on my neck, yes
(Yes, yes..) I'm haunted by these memories
And what I thought to be a premonition of a wedding ring
was just a dream, so now I'm takin ALL these drugs to go to sleep
Weed and White, lean and Sprite, hopin God is holdin me
(Miss..) I wanna blame her, but I ain't
(No, no..) I wanna touch her, but I can't
(No, no..) I still love her, I'm afraid
But her absence disturbs the harmony we made
And I never say I'll never find another girl
..who ain't a freeloader or a renter
..but a winner that'll buy me out
Terrace bring the sax in, I'm signin out

...SOUL~!</pre>
