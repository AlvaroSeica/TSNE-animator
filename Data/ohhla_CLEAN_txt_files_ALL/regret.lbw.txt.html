Song:   Regret
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I can't lie man
There some stuff I regret
Like letting down my fans
And cheating on my ex
Right
But I'm young
So What
Yeah
I'm gon make mistakes
And besides
Nobody erfect n e fuckin way
I swear to God
The press be all on me
Oscar Meyer bloggers
Everything they write in baloney
And why it feel like I got the whole world on me
Got all the money in the world
But yet I'm still lonely
And why in the fuck my best friend
Had to steal from me
Couldn't keep it real
So for that
I had to leave Sony
Some time I want to quit rap
Like I'm through with it
Why I don't get my respect?
And why they still act like I'm new to this?
They hate cause I fly
Should of came with a stewartest
When I did that show with Omarion
I was losing it
I'm on BET acting a asshole
Fighting with the interviewers
Why I do that for?
I can't lie
I was drugged out
Sippin syrup
Smoking weed
Shit had me bugged out
Even Jermaine didn't know who I was
He know me best
He been around me since day one
And are relation
Ship homie never changed
You can ask him
I'm still Mr. Money ain't thing
Got homies back at home
Talking bout he done changed
Lil arrogant bastard
He don't act the same
Who really write his shit?
Is it Tip or is it Wayne?
Is it Brat or is it Jermaine?
Will ya'll let me do my thing?
I don't even know what the big deal is
I'm writing from my soul
Man ya'll nigga got to feel this

[Talking]
Who help me and responsible for Bow Wow
Was really Snoop was
You know what I mean
It wasn't really anybody else to get back with was other than JD
So we made it happen
We put egos to the side
We called each other
Got in the studio
And from that day it was on
This my last album becease
For me
There's no more to be done on the music side
I've done everything
Like I said I've done everything from
And the scary thing is that I'm 22 years old
From the music side I've been doing it since I was 5
17 years</pre>
