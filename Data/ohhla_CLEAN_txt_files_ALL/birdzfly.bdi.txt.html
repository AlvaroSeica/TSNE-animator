[Intro] [Phonte]
Uh, keep it goin' y'all. Are we goin' y'all? Check it out
It's Phontigga, from NC to Bucktown
y'all niggas gon' Duck Down this is how we do it now yeah
For my nigga Buckshot. Yo, we better make history tonight man
It's my last night as a free man
She gonna motherfuckin' be here. In the motherfuckin' house
Tomorrow! (Alright.)

[Verse One] [Buckshot]
Ten o'clock on the dot, I
Make my way over to my girls
Drive by the shop
She in the wide body drop
All black
I didn't see her parked in the front so I say, "Fall back."
Called the cell, I heard, "Call back."
So I called back
Like a fool I heard more bashin' then laughin' on the other side
Word to mother I'm...ppppsst
Word to mother I'm not in the mood for the rude tactics
She think ahead then move backwards
Let me relax kid, cause 
I don't wanna catch me a case
Even though I could just fetch in my waist 
Stretch and embrace
Then place this nine in your face
I'm not
When I think about would I could have got I just stop and said
"Let me not get knocked by the cops
So before you get shot by the shot"
I play the block cause

[Chorus] [Singer] (Phonte)
[This is crazy baby
But I just adjust to all of the changes]
(Gotta move gotta grind with purpose
On my own thing dog
All y'all broads ain't worth it)
[This is crazy baby

But I just adjust to all of the changes]
(Tryin' to keep control of the mic
No time for all you silly hoes in my life
That's how we do it)

[Verse Two] [Phonte]
Oh what the heck
Let's get married and have a son named Dillon
No big deal, no sweat
No big meals and no checks
We was strugglin'
I guess we just couldn't handle that type stress
So we went our separate ways
Game over like X-Box
No hard feelings baby, we gave it our best shot
So I hopped on a Boeing and went back to tourin'
And figured, what the hell, I'll just go back to hoein'
It started with this first chick, I call her the R
Light skinned lookin' like she should have been in DeBarge
Her tit-ties was monstrous 
But had baby drama from another guy 
Otherwise I wouldn't have squashed it
Then there was this stripper chick I met in the mall
Who used to send me instant messages from Dockside Dolls
But now I got a new broad who rock my world too hard
And I'ma stop pimpin' and her plane lands tomor-row!

[Chorus] [Singer] (Phonte)
[This is crazy baby
But I just adjust 
to all of the changes]
(Gotta move gotta grind with purpose
On my own thing dog
All y'all broads ain't worth it)
[This is crazy baby

But I just adjust to all of the changes]
(Tryin' to keep control of the mic
No time for all you silly hoes in my life
That's how we do it)
 
[Verse Three] [Buckshot]
Me and Phonte sippin' this Bombay
I introduce this chick as my fiancee
And I say
She's sort of like Beyonce, beyond paid
She the boss so she like to floss like she on stage
She a flirt though (What?)
You know, flirt a lot
Work shop
Go berserk though, you heard it word of mouth
I had to cut her off
I had to cut her loose
The only bird I'm rockin' is a goose
Fly the coupe

[Singing]
You must be the man that I done heard about (What?)
It's Phonte and yeah I heard about the way you flirt around (Oh stop)
So can we work it out?

[Phonte]
Yeah, I know you heard about my line and my gamblin' of hoes at the shows
All the trickin' and philanderin' 
But now I'm just chillin' with my nigga named Buckshot
And for you girls, +Help Is On The Way+ like The Whatnauts
I must not break my discipline
My wifey take me to divorce court and have me back at the bus stop (#9!)

[Chorus] [Singer] (Phonte)
[This is crazy baby
But I just adjust 
to all of the changes]
(Gotta move gotta grind with purpose
On my own thing dog
All y'all broads ain't worth it)
[This is crazy baby

But I just adjust to all of the changes]
(Tryin' to keep control of the mic
No time for all you silly hoes in my life
That's how we do it)

[Outro]
You may find yourself. Living in a one room apartment
On the other side of Larsville
And you may mind yourself, in a Dominican house and a Dominican wife
You will ask yourself, "Well, how did I get here?"</pre>
