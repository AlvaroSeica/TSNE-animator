Snass: Yes baby...
Jenna: Yeah yeah
Snass: Listen to me...uh!
Jenna: Ooh baby!

[CHORUS]
Now that I'm yours (Uh!)
And you say you're in love with me
But do you know what this really means? (Yes baby)
I can't forget all the wrongs been done to me
Or now am I looking for 'empty dreams?
No! No!

[Verse 1]
Now that you're mine
Let me take you there
Let's wine and dine
Until the end of time
We can dance the night away
I'm here to stay
I don't know what to say
But I'm gonna treat you like a queen
You the only best thing I've ever seen
The only best beauty
Your ways are damn pretty
Everyday I look at you do things
I smile in disbelief
It's like life has just begun
Now let's do this gal
Let's take this love to the next level
Let's share what we deserve
We're a beautiful pair
Hand in hand our bond is gonna stay unbreakable

[CHORUS]
Now that I'm yours
Are you gonna be there for me? (Just take my hand)
Better think again if you're playing me
Oh no baby!
I can't forget all the wrongs been done to me
Or now am I looking for 'empty dreams?
(Don't think you can play)

[Verse 2]
Uh! Now that you're mine
Let's have fun
I made a promise, I vowed
Now you're all I can think about
As long as I'm around
You won't have to worry
So let's do it now
How about candlelight every night?
How about some soft music?
How about a little dance
I'm your man
Uh! You my woman
Let me hold you close
Let's have a little dose of each other (Now that I'm yours baby)
You smell like a rose
Lock all doors
Unplug all the phones
Now that you're mine
You have to have much trust in me (I don't wanna be played)
You have to have much trust in me (No! No! No!)

[CHORUS]
Now that I'm yours
Are you gonna be there for me? (Are you gonna be there?)
Better think again if you playing me (Oh yeah)
Now that I'm yours (Now that I'm yours)
And you say you'll be in love with me
Do you know what that really means?
(Don't do it, don't do it!)

[Verse 3]
When I first spotted you
I knew we would be cool
You were always by yourself at school
I approached you for us
You do not have to worry no more now
You have what you've been looking for
This is your Romeo
I fell in love with you
The very first time I saw you
You such a sweet thing you know
Such a quiet thing
Damn you drive me crazy
Let me hold you forever my dear
You have everything that my body can bear
My heart is beating, and just for you
The only thing I can have
You will wake up with my arms around you
I wanna hold you tight
Gal you are so fine
You make me wanna cry
I can't believe you mine
I won't attempt to leave you behind
And that's a promise
That's a promise gal
That's a promise, uh!

[CHORUS]
Now that I'm yours (Now that I'm yours)
And you say you'll be in love with me (Say you'll do it baby)
Do you know what this really means?
Do you know, do you know?

I can't forget all the wrongs been done to me
Or am I now looking for 'empty dreams?
...Now that I'm yours
...And you are mine
...Look at me I'm yours
...You mine you mine</pre>
