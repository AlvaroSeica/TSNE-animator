[Intro: Treasurer]
Aiyo, sometimes I want him to right roll the tape
I mean, I don't know, all this shit that's going on
In the industry, make me feel like I just wanna turn my back
But I can't, but yo, I wanna give a shout to my nigga Joe Maf'
My nigga Fonzarelli, my nigga Andre, my nigga Jay
Cat, Baby Child, my nigga Rock, my nigga, Napoleon
For the whole V.A., this for ya'll niggas, tight

[Joe Mafia]
Mind of Babylonian, my sting opium, sixteen shots'll
Open up, bloody fallopian, swallow this
Hollow tip slug, explosive novelist
Project, overdose, vomit, diamond cut your glass house
Vast spots snatch, spend flame fast, bitch nigga
Ballerina? Let's dance, blow avalanche
Gon' slash, it's my time, yours cold in '99
I still shine, my land, new plan, white collar crime
Shorties live with the pecan eyes, we lamping
New expansion, Henny mention, got you flinching
Tighten your bags, state to state, inner state, generate
Nitron, blow it strong, clear the block with a pump
How ill is it, niggas get, fucked up, drunk off, but still feel this
Friend of mine, smacked up, crash your image
Fake rapper pretenders follow, suits mimick
Real cats stay top shitting, while you're babysitting
Who gains some heavy hitting, thirty bomb, you're fogged tonight
Fatigued out, blood hounds got you sent, 20 cent spent, recoupable
Smile while I shoot the shit with you, move mysterious
Art superiors, dart Olympics, Maf' ain't feeling you (what niggas?) </pre>
