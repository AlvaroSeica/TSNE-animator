[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Aiyo, pull the car over, right here
Yeah... turn the lights off, man
That's where that bitch ass nigga live

[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino]
I, know, what you been doing lately
I've been watching you, I got the drop on you

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, I represent for all my manitos and pitos
On the block try'nna get rid of a kilo with Rico
Dom P. keep it on the d-lo, four-five-six, I roll c-lo
In front of the coochie frito, one love
For my tias and tios, mi amor sei tu quida mijo, these street's get friho
And your friends ain't, always your amigo
That's why I keep the black calico, to let ya body collapse slow, yo
Terrorist about to blow like Napalm
Remain calm it's the kid from the Arm, and I know

[Chorus 2X]

[Infinite]
My clip stay full, in need to empty
Patiently, waiting for fag niggas to tempt me
So test me, what was you, man or chick?
Figure you would, testing out ta, sign a bitch
A violent red line, seen and be my only device
And poppin' clutch, full throttle, as I pipe my bike
From lifetime of suffering, what is you hovering
Chump nigga, hurt ya feeling, that's why ya mumbling
I'm damn near, 25, no time for rumbling
I stand there, MP5, with nam's jumbling
Live by the code of the street, hood laws
You stretched out beside medics, lungs pause
You took, my laid back, land of the spite
Infinite, full clip man will show you the light

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
