[Chorus: Makeba Mooncycle]
Who are you, who are you
You, look at me (as we commence to reprogram)
Who are you, who are you
You, look at me (as we commence to reprogram)

[Makeba Mooncycle]
I wake up in the morning, drenched in a cold sweat
Stressed about the eyes, looking through my text
Whose out to get me, strip me, what a pity
Playing with my pennies, a jealous one's envy
It's usely a friend turned fiend, that got you bloody in
I'm hoping it's a dream, no control
Of what I'm thinking, I guess my mind is tripping
To stop time from keeping, copped a gat last weekend
They trynna stop my life, nailed me to a cross like Christ
Darkening my spirits, but I refused to hear it...

[Chorus]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Through those watching eyes, what do you see?
Your own assumption makes an ass out of me
Or is it you, that by your own crooked list
Seeing me, makes you wish you were the best
Like Jack, you can't handle this truth
Ask me a question, cuz I'm living proof
Hanging on a thin line, ready to snap
Trying to fend off any fatal attacks
All the real MC's, knocked off by two G's
Is this a plan, did I hit a nerve?
Did I mess up your groove, or fuck up your swerve?
Not the Madd Rapper, just paranoid
Your space can be taken, and you can be the void
It's a shame I have to carry every rhyme I ever wrote
In a bag on my back, with a half ounce of smoke
You the vibe stealers, we're writing concealers
Watch me rotate, deletion of fakes
With all your new riches, you done toughened up
Watch your fate, you can get stuck up
Your free to believe, what you damn well choose
Cuz when I go off, there's only one left to rule

[Chorus]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
There's no love without hate, there's no peace without war
Never the casualty, I settle all scores
Can you ever get enough, of taking what's mine
If it's not my energy, it's my mental or my rhymes
All this friendship is, I have no love
For thieves, backstabbers or money grubbers
Is that you or a big head scientist
Mad about the past, the fact I exist
To the enlightened, walk roads of righteousness
But I maintain my revenging success
Teach the kids the truth, won't leave you behind
I only got this way over years of hard time
Forget what you heard, peoples word don't matter
Without cash in your hands, dreams start to shatter
It seems like my whole life is a vibing universe
Like acid rain, when it comes down, it's dispurse
The change from a black white thing, to a unite thing
To your money, your money be right, thing
A no show tonight thing, instigators take flight, then
For the poor/rich fight, then
Cuz either style you fall on, decisions have to be made
Lying dead on the street, blood is my grave
Too much information I gave... there's no one left to save
