[Immortal Technique]
Here's a toast to the dead; if you don't drink, smoke to the head
For the freedom fighters killed by the Feds
For those who died hard in the streets, soakin in red
And died slow asleep in a dream, chokin in bed
Here's a toast to the dead, for my enemies that have gone
I'm not a coward, so, celebrating that would be wrong
I pray to God that your soul'll come back again
So I can see you in the next life and finish it then
A toast to the dead, for criminals, burning in hell
I wonder how many Presidents are burning as well
Emperors, popes, senators, generals
Amputees feelin lucky until they see the vegetables
A toast to the dead, for those who are forgotten
Written out of the history by the corrupted and rotten
Black saints whitewashed during La Reconquista
Thousands of Indio-Spaniards used to conquer the Incas
Fuck a moment of silence, I need a moment of violence
like the nineteenth-century Caribbean Islands
Long love those who came before, that paved the way for me
The warriors and scientists that came before slavery
And if that last lyric was predictable, well
take that clairvoyance and apply it to life in the physical
Presumptuous, half-hearted homunculus
Self-destruction is the power, without knowin what the function is

[Chorus]

[Immortal Technique]
Here's a toast to the dead, for all of my fam
I will never let an idea die with a man
My rhymes are like Nazca lines, designed to give a view of this
J Dilla's still alive as long as his music is
A toast to the dead, for rap legends and pioneers
Your legacy, won't be forsaken as long as I am here
Knowledge of the past and, wisdom of the present
I'll teach and leave in the hands of a worthy lieutenant
A toast to the dead, for children with cancer and AIDS
A cure exists and you probably coulda been saved
Sad to see medicine divorce morality
Corporate home-wreckers pimpin up a salary
A toast to the dead, for those, that'll die today
For victims of those exonerated by DNA
The only thing worse than giving freedom to the guilty
is killing the innocent and leaving your soul filthy
Immortal Technique, remember me when I'm gone
I encrypted my lyrics to stay alive in the song
So you'll always keep a piece, of my spirit inside
when you struggle to complete what I started before I died
But some of you won't survive the changes the Earth makes
Swallowed by tsunamis, hurricanes and earthquakes
And that's just the first stage if you cannot reverse ways
and realize that we are one, regardless of our birthplace

[Chorus]

[Immortal Technique]
My last toast to the dead is for the listener
Human being or extraterrestrial visitor
Remember us for more than our primitive ways
when you study us long after the end of our days...</pre>
