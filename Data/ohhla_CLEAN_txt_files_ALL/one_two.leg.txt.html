Don't die for no street
'Cause the street ain't gonna die for you

[One, one, two, one-two,] REPEATED IN BACKGROUND
People
People with no future
Fight the hardest
People
People with no future
Fight the hardest
Rendaven
Rendaven

They don't understand your god
Every man is at war
Ban free assembly
Eatin' out of bean cans
War
Federal government has its hand at war
For all your cash
Get your ass taxed
It's like drinkin' a galloon of anthrax
Damn this shit, 2000
It's gettin' medieval
So we on the streets actin' medieval
People with no future fight the hardest
The sequel will be different
The smartest ain't always the smartest
But education is a form of classism
Tearin' apart us as they cart us
In a casket from the drippin' ghetto
Dart a bus of explosives through the White House
Relocate the president by my momma house
In the slums
See where the screams
Are comin' from
You gotta pay the dues for every wrinkle on your face
They come to easy for ya
I'll show you what thirty years of manual labor will do
Thirty years of manual labor will do

[One, two ] REPEATED IN BACKGROUND
La, la, la la la la
People with no future fight the hardest

Russian fool like Boris Yelstin
You'll resign, check, one, two days into the millennium
With no leader
Who
So I leave myself to obtain clues
Jesus Christ is a white man through our view
Seen as a way to politely brainwash the world and praise white people
I be trippin'
People I knew
That grew up with
That be dissin'
White people goin' to church every Sunday and pray
To a picture of a white man
Damn, in the church during the civil rights movement
Banned three thousand
I scream, "Put your faith in your soul!"
You worried about what's gonna happen to ya
After you go, you die
What about when you alive?
What's really heaven and hell? Survive
Uh, think about that
You don't want to think about that, huh?

[One, two ] REPEATED IN BACKGROUND
La, la, la la la la
La, la, la la la la
La, la, la la la la
People with no future fight the hardest
La, la, la la la la
People with no future fight the hardest
People with no future fight the hardest</pre>
