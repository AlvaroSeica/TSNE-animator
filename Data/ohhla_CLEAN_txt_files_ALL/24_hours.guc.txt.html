[Intro/Chorus]
I'm up twenty-fo' hours, money and the power
Stuntin on the hoes and I'm shittin on the cowards
Up twenty-fo' hours... I'm up twenty-fo' hours
I'm up twenty-fo' hours, no shit shave or shower
Until I get my money back, I gotta get my money up
Up twenty-fo' hours... I'm up twenty-fo' hours

[Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci nigga!
Damn it's a good day, damn it's a good day
Called Drumma Boy and told him let's go make a hood tape
First thing I'ma do, pull out my seven-fo'
Candy coated black thangs, sittin on them Forgi'os
Twenty-fo' towers, eight bricks of powder
Ten bails of 'dro what I paid for the flour
Dont talk about my Lambo' talk about my 'Rarri
Talk about my Phantom or talk about my Harley
Brick Squad biker boy, +Angel+	named +Charlie+
Goons goin psycho, white boy gnarly
Every twenty-fo' seconds passin me the Marley
Lames tryin to diss don't effect me hardly (it's Gucci!)

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm up twenty-fo' hours nigga... it's Gucci!
I'm goin to the bank again, make another deposit (cha-ching)
It's gettin kinda chilly bring my minks up out the closet (BURR!)
Gettin kinda warm, bring my jewelry out the safe (BLING!)
If it be a problem put the hater in his place (POW!)
I'm slicker than a oil spill, sharper than a razor
I'm screamin "Anybody get it" like my nigga Major
Fin' to cop a condo and fill it full of ammo
Brick Squad bandana on, I think I'm fuckin Rambo
It's Gucci! I'ma killer so don't push me
Brick Squad ain't no pussy niggaz runnin with them wig splitters
Niggas screamin roll one, Gucci let me hold some
But I can't let you hold none, I hit you with the whole drum

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Twenty-fo' hour grind, no sleep
I'm fuckin with a white girl, you can call me Ice-T (Coco!)
Cause I got my crystals on, you can call 'em Spike Lee
Robbin me unlikely, last try I dropped 'em
Hollow tips stopped 'em, I ain't have time to box him
Stuntin like an actor, runnin like an athlete
Straight to the money like a sprinter at a track meet
First signed Waka, then I signed Gucci
Then I signed Brick Squad, tell 'em come and sue me

[Chorus] - repeat 2X to fade</pre>
