Oh, I see your mad at me now huh?
Why you lookin at me like that?
What's really happenin?
You know the deal was when you first met me.
You know, shit, I was doin thangs.
You know, I'm still doin thangs.
Ain't goin stop doin thangs.
C'mon girl, ya know, stop all that cryin ya know.
Listen here, look, check this out.

Another case of infactuation
When you first laid eyes on me
Yes it was
You were in suspended animation
Cause I was rolling on them D's
Hey, candy purple with the system bumping
I guess it turns you on
Sometimes you see me on the corner hustling
Talking on my cellular phone
And now the ladies wanna date a baller
And I guess it's for security, you wanna be with me
Every day my money's growin taller
Because I'm living life of a G

And you fell in love (baby yeah)
With a gangsta (You fell in love, baby yeah)
And you fell in love (baby yeah)
With a gangsta

Yesterday I met you at the hotel
So we could be all alone
Me and you and you do it so well
It's like we're being in a zone
Hey, now you tellin people I'm your boyfriend
And you supposed to have my baby
Are you crazy
Ladies like you come a dime a dozen
Tryin to fullfill a fantasy
Constantly your blowin up my pager
So I could serve you like a fiend
The situation's growing kinda major
Now tell me what do you expect from me

Cause you fell in love (baby yeah)
With a gangsta (You fell in love, baby yeah)
And you fell in love (You fell in love)
With a gangsta
You fell in love (Sometimes I can't help myself)
With a gangsta (And it seems like you can't help yourself either baby)
You fell in love (You fell in love)
With a gangsta (And it's hard for you to change me)

Girl can't you see I'm only a G</pre>
