Uh...

[La the Darkman]
These niggaz runnin' 'round talkin' 'bout the way I spit
I got that work, Master P "Bout It, Bout It" shit
I'ma be rich from the way that white powder hit
Gettin' ripped, take Bahamas trips with my click
A great whale, gave a couple chips to my bitch
She bought a house, that's somethin' she can live with
I told her, "Good decision, baby girl I see ya vision"
That let me know you my produce, when I talk you listen
You see them diamonds glisten, you better get you some
You ain't hustlin' you ain't eatin', where I'm from
It go from Brooklyn, down to Michigan
Down in Houston, know they fuckin' wit it dunn
I flip that hard, that soft or that heroin
Or that soap, or them pills, or that marijuan'
I get that money, huh, don't even worry 'bout it
I know you heard about it, my boy got murdered by it
But I'ma keep it goin', bricks of yae I keep it flowin'
And I get higher than a 747 Boeing
Cuz I know where I'm goin', nigga, straight to the bank
Cuz if ya lips ain't loose, ya ship won't sank

[Chorus x4: La the Darkman]
I get that money, huh, don't even worry 'bout it
Don't even worry 'bout it, don't even worry 'bout it

[Interlude: La the Darkman]
Nigga, don't worry 'bout me
You need to be worryin' about yo' motherfuckin' self

[La the Darkman]
I'm a gat pro, papa was a no show
My mama taught me early, this the wrong way to go
That's when I let her know, I gotta get that dough
Either be paid, dead or locked up, that's for sho'
But I ain't workin' for no fuckin' slave owner though
Put twenty thousand yearly, need to kiss my asshole
I'd rather flip weight, get cake, switch states
And if the feds catch me, that's the chance I take
I need a bigger stake, to eat a bigger steak
A T-bone, home fries and some Welch's grape
Nigga, I got the juice, forty cal let it loose
The type of dude throw Bishop ass off the roof
Doggy don't take me lightly, all that drama don't excite me
If you don't know, 'round here I'm the man slightly
I get that quiet money, L.A./Watts hired money
At thirty-five, I'm tryin' to retire money
For Oscar Meyer, I put a hole through ya
Them AK bullets'll do somethin' terrible to ya

[Chorus x4]

[Outro: La the Darkman]
Nigga...
