[Mo B. Dick/(Sons of Funk)]
Chorus
Won't you get up on it. (Twerk something for me)
Won't you get up on it. (Twerk something, twerk something.)

[Mo B. Dick]
I can't believe how you doing this to me
You know I want it baby, honey can't you see
Girl you so damn fine, your like the bowl of health
You better stop it girl cause I can't help myself
It's got them shame and you really need to stop
They oughta lock you up with that ass that you got
What I'm trying to say is that your wrong for all that path
You must be jelly girl cause jam don't shake like that

[Mo B. Dick/Sons Of Funk]
Chorus

[Sons of Funk]
And that's the man, like the way that you twerk'n me
I won't stop pushing till I'm between 'em sheets
I like that pretty brown round when you lay it down
Girl don't stop just twerk me

Come and get this dollar with that booty that you jiggle
Let me take you to the back so I can sample just a little
It's my birthday so I want the via piece
Special me and you and your girlfriend on that other level
Flip floppin' drawers droppin' buck naked to the bone
If you didn't come to fuck bring your stanky ass home
Cause ain't nothing but some freaks actin' bad as they wanna
Twerk something, hurt something, bounce that ass, get up on it girl

[Mo B. Dick/Sons Of Funk]
Chorus

[Mo B. Dick]
You gotta twerk for them dollars girl
You gotta twerk for them benjamins
You gotta twerk for them tibbets girl
You gotta twerk to get paid</pre>
