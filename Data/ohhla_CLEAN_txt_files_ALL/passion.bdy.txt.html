[Intro: Ice-T]
Ever since I was a baby, I never knew, if there was any superior power
I'm a grown man, and I still don't know

[Verse One: Ice-T]
I will be the only one, you'll ever trust, you'll ever need
The only truth, the born again, the son of one, the Devil's pain (PAIN!!)
You all I need, your faith's my life, belief's my blood
I feed your hope, my book is law
To challenge me is blasphemy, my wrath is hell (HELL!!)
I have dies a thousand deaths, my pain's been felt two thousand years
And to my soul, I've lead my peers, salvation is their only hope (HOPE!!)
To save them from their evil ways, their sinning lives, their evil paths
But you must trust, give me your soul, then you must read and then believe!

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]
For your sins I...
For your love I...
For your souls I...
Feel my.. Passion!

[Hook: Ice-T]
Is there a God? - Is there a God?
Is there a God? - Is there a God?
Is there a God? - Is there a God?
Is there a God? - Is there a God?

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]
For your sins I...
For your love I...
For your souls I...
Feel my.. Passion!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I am one the only one, the son of God, if you believe
The fear of me, is taught to those in need of hope
The sick and broke, the book of me, written by men
Considered truth, and by the rules
All that believe, controls the lives
It's holly words bought in through church
It's nemesis as Lucifer, the fallen angel, the second son
If you believe; his power matches mine with evil, hate and pain! (PAIN!!)
A war is battled every day, every second so they say
We are ghosts but still alive but all this requires faith! (FAITH!!)

[Hook: Ice-T]
Is there a God? - Is there a God?
Is there a God? - Is there a God?
Is there a God? - Is there a God?
Is there a God? - Is there a God?</pre>
