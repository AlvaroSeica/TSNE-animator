[Curren$y]
Let the little homie kick it in the auto shop with us
Long as he can make store runs and keep his mouth shut
Same way I came up
All my triple o's was hood famous
Nice guy surrounded by wolves, wild dangerous that's where I gained this cool
Walk this talk, you trying to duplicate and make tools
All you do is make fools of yourselves
Underground jewels testa copping pot, wallet in the wishing well
Evidence, niggas can fail
Tryna get close to the jet code
But it will never get deciphere by a rookie pilot
That's why I sit opposite to drive a 63 impala bad bitch
Change steering wheel guidence
I'm out the window sky watching, plotting as usual
That's what I'm doing when I'm quite
Can't remember shorty name but she had that loud pack
The other night in tallahasse and I thank her for that
Fine, freaky [?] with her legs behind her back
In the wee hours of the morning, picture mailin that she horny
But love I'm tryna fuck with this money

[Chorus]
We bust raps like d-boys bust gats, we the type of people that don't burry the axe
We bust raps like d boys bust gats, we the type of people cutluss, monte carlo, regals
We bust raps like d-boys bust gats, we the type of people that don't burry the axe
We bust raps like d boys bust gats, we the type of people cutluss, monte carlo, regals

We bust raps like we bust these gats, we the type of people that don't bury the hatch
We bust raps like we bust these gats, we the type of people chevy's and gmc's to
We bust raps like we bust these gats, we the type that don't bury the hatch
We bust raps like we bust these gats, we the type of people chevy's and gmc's to

[Prodigy]
Fuck it, it's the life of the shooting star
Gotta move smart
Can't get caught slipping there all wanna see me fall
Take my punches like a troop but take my loses like a man
And come with the territory, take the good with the bad
Throw the dice watch them tumble where they land so big
Everything is not strategic, sometime we risk our life
Sometime we risk our love, our money and our freedom
Fuck that bullshit we feed it, to see if you gone eat it
In new york we manipulate naive dummies
We beat you on the head it's just game we be running
Sometime, but most of the time we don't play
They can't figure us out, we like it that way
The road to the riches so long I be catch blisters
All these crabs in a bucket pull you down tryna get em
Every man for them self, every women won't bags and shoes
We the type of people that'll find you

[Chorus]</pre>
