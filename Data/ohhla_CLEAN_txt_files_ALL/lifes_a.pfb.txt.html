Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[women]
Nigga tryin to flip on me, callin me a BITCH
  Why your nigga callin you a BEITCH?
Does he know what a bitch is?

[man]
Bitch, bitch I'll tell you what's a bitch!
Life, bi- you a bi- nah life's a bitch, bitch!

[repeat 8X]
Life's a bitch, and then you die

[Pudgee]
Life's a bitch and then you die so why try to move ahead
When with every move you make, you get closer to death
Yo is what they say when they're tryin to get your attention
But they don't sound too convincin to me
Cause I done heard all of the news
From the whose-not, those who sing the blues and the who's who
Tellin me to get an education and get a job
No in five years I was on probation
Hard to listen and solutions puttin stops to them
Can't advise me lest you walked in my mocassins
Who are you to pose the question to me, why?
Life's a bitch and then you die

[Chorus]
Do you agree that life is a bitch? (yea yea)
Do you think it's bout time for a switch? (yea yea)
Are you tired of the man gettin rich? (yea yea)
.. life's a bitch, life's a bitch

[repeat 8X]
Life's a bitch, and then you die

[Pudgee]
It never gets any better than the last time
Every night I kneel by my bedside, pray to God and ask why
people do the things they do, offendin you
You make it big and yup, they're a friend to you
And when you fall on your face it's real funny
Those pretendin, everything is centered around the money
I'm back to make you think again
Why a dime is a girl's best friend instead of the men
Probably cause they always need things
See what greed brings?  Keep your material things
Life ain't the only thing round here that's a bitch..
hehe.. and then you die

[Chorus]

[repeat 8X]
Life's a bitch, and then you die

Life's a bitch.. and then you die
Life's a bitch.. and then you die
Life's a bitch.. and then you die
Life's a bitch.. and then you die, and then you die

[repeat 8X]
Life's a bitch, and then you die

[Pudgee]
Leave it up to me to put it all on the line
Life is quicker than sex and shorter than a good time
We know that it goes quick, gotta make the most of it
Watch your back and with that watch who you're gettin closer with
People wanna know you, yeah they wanna know me too
That's when they start gettin nosey
They ensue, watchin every move that you make
Can't make a move, cause now you got a whole lot to lose
You know what you gotta do when you do it, most won't
Damned if you do, damned if you don't
But I just want you to know the what when where how and why
Life's a bitch, and then you die

[Chorus]

[repeat 16X]
Life's a bitch, and then you die</pre>
