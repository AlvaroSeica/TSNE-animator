love child love child
oh im a love child a love child
a wild child wild child
love child love child

it's a sadder day than last saturday
can you help liposuck all my fat away
come and see dig my stee between you and me
insecure feelin obscure a lot of times unsure
rapper spit it rapid-fire buck cuz I'm stuck in the muck and the mire
latch on anything going up to be higher
(that's ferocious) outlandish atrocious, that I'm a mistake
and this is the closest i'll ever be to reaching or
attaining my goal that contract I'm breaching maintain control
like buff singers who swole slowly crawlin outta rabbit hole comin for your soul
now I see it destiny and purpose hear a small still voice
sayin "Trust Me Don't Be Nervous" fill my pocket with the 10 percent
head to sunday service stop the swirl of my tilt-a Â–whirl get it girl

[Chorus]
love child love child
you never know how much I
love child love child
you need to slow your roll
wild child wild child
and get to know about this love child love child love child [x2]

you never know how much I
you need to slow your roll love child...love child love child love child

well it's a different day and this particular day
i was thinking bout life and the part I play
my purpose man feeling worthless and
if parenthood really was a part of the plan
cause the way I see I wasn't meant to be
just a great awake in a love mistake
so the price was paid and a life was made
then a wife betrayed with a son to raise
foundation layed for the wrong influence
path directed by a strong influence
runnin wild scarred child
headed upstate for the pen now
now im grown with kids of my own
and I gotta do right what the grans did wrong
now im in a battle for my soul control
tryin to get back everything they stole

[Chorus]
love child love child
you never know how much I
love child love child
you need to slow your roll
wild child wild child
and get to know about this
love child love child love child [x2]

oh listen to me now oooooh sit down for a moment oooooh

[Chorus]
love child love child
you never know how much I
love child love child
you need to slow your roll
wild child wild child
and get to know about this
love child love child get to know!

[Chorus]
love child love child
you never know how much I
love child love child
you need to slow your roll
wild child wild child
and get to know about this love child love child love child

you never know how much I
you need to slow you roll
love child love child love child

oooho wild child
