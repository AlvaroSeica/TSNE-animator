[Intro: Fes Taylor]

[Fes Taylor]
They said Shows blew his head out
I'm cryin' my ass off, and Visine can't get the red out
That's my dude, remember we did juxes?
Came from good families, still went crooked
When ya right hand turned on you, I was ready to lay him
And that was my man too, still ready to play him
I spray him, lay him like crooks on the bed
Fucked my head up, these niggaz wanna kill my nigga dead
Tryin' to make it seem like suicide
But he was the type of homey to shoot you, make you look him in the eye
Just seen ya little mans, they lookin' just like you
Crazy shit go through my head, things that I might do
The responsibilities to ya fam
So it feel like I gotta shoot somebody, tell 'em who I am
Damn, we miss you like the good old days
You know, goin' to see some hoes, showin' off our waves
I know you disagree me fuckin' with ya cousin
But I treated her good, only woman I was lovin'
The end of discussion, reminisce, us two hustlin'
Tryin' to turn nothin' into somethin'
So listen every time that I flow, mention the memory of Sideshow...
I miss you, my nigga...

[Chorus: Lot-a-Nerv]
I can't deny the way I feel inside, but my brothers dyin'
That's why, I roll with iron
Can't sleep an eye, and Lord knows I'm tryin'
And I, can't seem to hold on
It's gettin' colder, how much longer can I...
Can't seem to stop these tearz
Can't seem to stop these tearz...

[Inspectah Deck]
Street dreams are made of these
The blood, sweat and tears, the drama and the P's
When niggaz stray trippin' off P, X and D
Yo, E know the drill, it was live, he caught three
Tone came home in the sixth, copped the long four-fifth
Same day, start hoggin' the strip
But them little niggaz totin' them grips, ain't foldin' for shit
Same day, got thrown in the ditch
Yo, shit changed, everybody walkin' with them big thangs
Clips bang, drop another body for some quick change
And get a name, the feelin', call it Max Payne
No time to cry, you caught up in the Fast Lane
The crack game got him thinkin' that he Frank White
Thug nigga wiped out by the same type

[Chorus]

[Lot-a-Nerv]
Dear Lord, I'm writin' you a letter of my life
I'm sorry, I was wrong, I should've done right
I went left, I should've went right
Now I'm right where I left off, on my knees pleadin' for my life
That's from all the dead soldiers that was lost in the wars
Tryin' to make it into Heaven 'fore the Lord close the doors
Damn, we miss Spiderman, 2 Cent and Kase
Sideshow, Kio, B. Ghost and Drey
It's weird everyday wakin' up and not seein' y'all face
Shook the fuckin' big feelin' that I hate
Pain, please explain how I'm supposed to feel inside
Here's the reason why I cry cuz most of my niggaz died
Why...

[Chorus]</pre>
