[Frank Ocean]
I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on
My fingertips, and my lips
They burn, from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump, you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy - Forrest Gump
I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff, and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest - Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips
They burn, from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump, you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy - Forrest Gump
I saw your game Forrest
I was screaming run 44
But you kept running past the end zone
Oh where'd you go Forrest? Forrest Gump
My fingertips, and my lips
They burn, from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump, you run my mind boy
Running on my mind boy - Forrest Gump
Forest green, forest blues
I re-mem-ber you
If this is love, I know it's true
I won't for-get you (youuuu)
(Oh you you, oh you you) it's for you Forrest
(It's you you, oh you you) it's for you Forrest - Forrest Gump</pre>
