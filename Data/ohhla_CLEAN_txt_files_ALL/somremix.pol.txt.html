[Dirt Gritie]     
Ayo, court cases, criminals, snitches ratting on kinfolk 
Crew fled the ship but left the ship with sink holes
If not trust in fam, I would think hoes 
Smile in your face I could see they dimples 
He talk a good game but he didn't keep his thing close 
Who killed his brother, maybe the beast knows 
In the street yo, for us to taste butter you got to see toast
Brag and boast end up in a body bag and poached 
Leaking badly scorched 
But that's the game of course 
You can't be a lame of course 
Hustle hard, work smart, use your brain of course 
These niggas acting like they be dames of course
But I done seen some things that'll make you change your frame of thoughts 
Every movie gotta have a plot 
So when we make moves yo they planned with thought, its hot
  
[Chorus 2X - Dirt Gritie]       
It's hot right now
Beast in the streets on the watch right now 
Brothers tryn'a eat on the block right now 
Chilling with my shorty on the low hold it down 
Cause it's hot right now 
  
[Dirt Gritie]     
Ayo, court cases, criminals, snitches ratting on kinfolk 
Crew fled the ship but left the ship with sink holes 
Spies in your crib looking through the peep hole 
You played the sheep roll that's probably why you got your knees broke 
Police in the streets watch for evil 
We watching these hoes and making moves on the D-low 
You know my steelo, a 1-8-2 King big up my people 
That lock and load to get that cash 
In a world where revenge will release it's wrath 
In a world wind of furriating speech they blast 
Till only one man's left standing at last 
When diplomacy breaks down violence is inevitable 
Living in the land of 40 devils 
It's the pick, the sickle and the shovel that leaves calluses 
On gravedigger's hands while nature balances, nature balances 
  
[Chorus 2X - Dirt Gritie]       
It's hot right now
Beast in the streets on the watch right now 
Brothers tryn'a eat on the block right now 
Chilling with my shorty on the low hold it down 
Cause it's hot right now 
  
[Dirt Gritie]     
Ayo, court cases, criminals, snitches ratting on kinfolk 
Crew fled the ship but left the ship with sink holes 
Shorty's on her knees for the pay roll 
Cash under the table, don't tell the gov cause if they know what they know 
Shorty's sipping boons and sniffing yayo
And hanging with thugs on the D-Low 
When in need of a sitter she's asking these folks 
So she could leave home and get her back blown 
3 to 4 days a week yo 
That shit is week though
Stash the crack inside the asshole 
And the gat you know where that go 
In the club they play the back low 
Shady individuals acting invincible 
But you don't wanna hear the gat blow 
Cause when the gat blow it ain't racist 
Anybody in the way gone face it 
Even Shorty getting wasted 
Kids left home waiting she didn't make it   
  
[Chorus 2X - Dirt Gritie]       
It's hot right now 
Beast in the streets on the watch right now 
Brothers tryn'a eat on the block right now 
Chilling with my shorty on the low hold it down 
Cause it's hot right now</pre>
