[Saul Williams - singing]
Dance, dance where the streets are paved with gold
And the angels and the gods do what they're told
You wanna catch a little glimpse of how the truth unfolds
You just dance, dance, dance - tick, tick, explode
Hey, hey, everybody come and dance with me
And leave your fears at the door carved from the tree
They say the apple never falls far from repeat
So shut the door, set your floor, crush, crush the seeds

Oh-whoa, you wanna live, you wanna jump and fly
You wanna crack that whip, you wanna get inside
Oh-whoa, c'mon, c'mon let me take you for, a ride
Oh-whoa, you wanna kiss you wanna get into
what the preachers and the teachers told you not to do
Oh-whoa, if only for tonight sweetheart, be God

Dance, dance where the saints all come to play
And the angels dyed their feathers cool cool decay
And if your judging by the shoes you'll think God is gay
Watch Mary work that thing down Magdalene
Oh-whoa little momma, come and dance with me
Let that tight rope get you from that A to B
Now pull that turning trigger then
Stop and freeze until the grippo quit but then drop the beat

Oh-whoa, you wanna live, you wanna jump and fly
You wanna transcend more than meets the eye
Oh-whoa, the stars are all aligned tonight, let's try
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, you wanna kiss you wanna get into
what the preachers and the teachers told you not to do
Oh-whoa, well when you kiss me look me in, my eye

Cause I wanna see - who's dancing with me
I wanna know - which trumpet to blow
I'm ready to blow - stare into the O
I'm ready to blow - what's more tham you know
This is Niggy Pop

He's dancing, she's dancing
Keep dancing, I'm dancing
You're dancing, she's dancing
He's dancing, we're dancing
Keep dancing, I'm dancing
She's dancing, he's dancing
You're dancing, we're dancing
Keep dancing...</pre>
