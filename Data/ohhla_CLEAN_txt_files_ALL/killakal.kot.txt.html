And the beat goes bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

The beats go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
(background: sweet sun shine, clouds from bongs 
Smoke that cripto California)

(D-loc)
We moving through the west (west)
We blaze up the spot
Represent Killa Kali hold it down for the krop
With the beats that knock you know the kings shit bangs
Run and get my mouthafucka's with this insane strain
Take it straight to your brain; maybe clear out your vision
KMK mob, another funky expedition
Don't get that superstition kottonmouth is the king
Prime time, fight now, we in the middle of the ring

(The Judge)
Killa Kali, soldier born and raised
Living life in a daze 
Kicking in the walls of your maze
Blowing this strain on your face
Living life with no shame
Take some body through a dream watch the power I brang
Straight from California, a rebel on the loose 
They call me number seven, to prepare another noose
Try to catch me if you can, tell me what you wanna do (what, what)
Don't be running after me 'cuz I'm coming after you (what, what)

(Hook)
We come from Killa Kali the place where the cripts grow
Over here's where we hold the best endo
North kali all the way to Diego 
Slang elbows; lay real low
No body moves in the room 'til we say so
King's clip, drip, skit, sick throws
Don't mistake the Krown for a low
We kings in this shit if you didn't now you know

(Johnny Richter)
For the last fucking time 
I'm from P-Town, drop down, bye
If you wanna you can come around but it better get me high (get me high)
If you wanna stay (get me high) (P-Town)
You better know when I wanna break it from the pound on down
So as for the weed 
I can get you what you need (whatchu need, whatchu need) in a hurry 
The sticky green and talk about his shit first
What you couldn't see 'cuz like "my mouthafucking vision's blurry"
So I'ma get my 2:15 (take that!)

(Daddy X)
It's a survival test coming straight from the west (straight from the west)
We bumping everyday with the kings on our chest 
Every where that we creep we get no sleep
Another twenty thousand and we'll be home free
I shake 'em off everyday, any way, every configuration (shake 'em off)
Straight to the bed like (shake 'em of shake 'em off) your girls miscreating 
It's a big bang theory hear me smoking (bang bang)
Kottonmouth kings Killa Kali rotation

(Hook)
Killa Kali the place where the cripts grow
Over here's where we hold the best endo
North kali all the way to Diego 
Slang elbows; lay real low
No body moves in the room 'til we say so
King's clip, drip, skit, sick throws
Don't mistake the Krown for a low
We kings in this shit if you didn't now you know

Sweet sunshine, sweet sunshine, sweet sunshine, sweet sunshine, sweet sunshine,
Sweet sunshine, clouds from bongs smoke that cripto California
Sweet sunshine, clouds from bongs smoke that cripto California

(The Judge)
Here comes the judge BEEOOTTCCHH
And hell is approaching
An intelligent humble temple may call it ferocious (ohhhaaaa)
I hit up on the roaches so I can stay high
(I promise will smoke out 'til the day that we die) 

(D-Loc)
Proper headed will get you bust when your puffing with us
When you step into the session and clear the bong NOW PUFF!! (bong out with us)

(Daddy X)
Now its like then when I blaze my shit
Better role your spliff and chief your chips

(Johnny Richter)
Nnnoooww I'm deep in the session no questions please
'Cuz you shut the fuck up and back about five feet (shut the fuck up)
Let me smoke my weed in peace with my peeps
This spliff complete with keef no seed

Sweet sunshine, clouds from bongs smoke that cripto California
Sweet sunshine, clouds from bongs smoke that cripto California
