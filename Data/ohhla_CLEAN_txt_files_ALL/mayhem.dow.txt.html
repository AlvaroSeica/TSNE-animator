(Verse 1)
[Mr. Shadow] As I enter
             I'm gonna represent the
[Both]       Mayhem Click
[Mr. Shadow] So let the Mayhem begin
[Lil' Rob]   You fools need to quit
[Mr. Shadow] Playa-hatin' on these two
             Individuals
             Versatile criminals
[Lil' Rob]   203 be the penal code
             M-A, Y, H, E, M
             Two bald headed Mexicans
[Mr. Shadow] In your area, scarin' ya, starin' ya
             I'm darin' ya
[Lil' Rob]   Come with me and see mass hysteria
             Witness
             What we go through
             What
             Would you do
             If you did, what we do, you'd be through, stuck like glue
[Mr. Shadow] Fool
             You could never come close, east or west coast
             Worldwide, known for the flows, that we've thrown
             We have shown
             The people how it's done, we do it just for fun 
[Lil' Rob]   While drinkin' redrum like a vet from Vietnam
[Mr. Shadow] Droppin' bombs like The Gap Band
             And give a grin
             I feel the need to sin
[Both]       Now let the Mayhem begin

[Male Cop]
We got shot fired on the 2100 Apocuny Street
It appears to be, two male hispanics heading south in a black '91 Accord
Proceed with caution, I repeat
Proceed with caution
Armed and dangerous
