Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Mess with the chop, That's durty pop {*4X*}

I done came from the barricade..
I still came from a place, where they showin no love
I'm like a broke game, but life is too real
Like a blue pill, what do I eat today?
And what do I drink today?
That's a good question, that's a real question..
Help me out here. I'm outche, I'm outche
For real boy

Stay away from those cannons, they outche
Let them niggas kno, I got family... we outche
Let them suckas kno that cannon got the zip code
5150. That done did it... for real
Niggas game tight? Shiit, I had to boss up
I'm a hit em myself, I do it all because
I got love in my heart, suckas wanna fake a grudge
Niggas be lyin on their dick, I'm a do my thang bitch
That's words that kill, I'm really I'll
Rep westside, Until the navys sealed
Fuck with me and die!

Mess with the chop, That's durty pop {*8X*}</pre>
