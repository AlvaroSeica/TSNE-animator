[Verse 1]
There were flashing lights when we met
Not the typical place you would be
In a flash of time my mind was set
I knew you were the girl there for me

[Bridge]
And though you just wanted to leave
Imagine how great it could be
The F-U-T-U-R-E (spells the future girl)
Sit down hold your horses don't leave (where you going girl?)

[Chorus]
Come and sit with me don't be so quick to leave (please)
I really like you girl (girl, girl)
Let's trade thoughts and words explore the universe (verse)
But just don't leave me girl (girl, girl)
I really like you girl (girl) girl (girl)
From the moment (the moment) that we met (we met)
I really like you girl (girl) oh girl (girl)
And I know (I know) this is it (this is it)

[Verse 2]
Against the wall is where ya lean
The most beautiful girl that I've seen
Out of this world my God you bling
I'm surprised that you are a human being

[Bridge]
And though you just wanted to leave
Imagine how great it could be
The F-U-T-U-R-E (spells the future girl)
Sit down hold your horses don't leave (where you going girl?)

[Chorus]

[harmonica solo; music]

[Chorus]

Yo... I think I got the one now (uh-huh)
Never me man never me... never in a million years (uh-huh)
But I do... Haha... Whoo!
