[Intro]
Yo Paul this is Ari you can kiss my ass
I wasn't interested in you anyhow
I was just interested in the B-Boys
So fuck you my man
{*scratched: "Who is it?"*}

[Verse One]
Who is the man comin down your block?
It's me you see, with the funky clock
Cause, I'm doin just what I like to
Today is my day yeah and I'ma get nice too
You gotta keep movin and you can't say nothin
I'ma keep bouncin and bumpin and stuff
And one thing you ought to know
Well I'm... The Maestro

[Interlude]
Yeah you motherfuckers, I'm all that!
I see you lookin at me sayin
"How can he be so skinny and live so fat?"
You know why? Cause I'm The Maestro
Yea, you know and I'm {"movin on my wheels"}
{"You got that?"}

[Verse Two]
I feel like Rufus Thomas, the crown prince of dance
I'm Mike D and I'm known for romance
I'm the crazy baldhead with the part on the side
And I'm ridin down the block like I'm on a water slide
Cause it's the type of day I feel like pressin my luck
Cause I got nothin to lose cause I don't give a fuck
See a player I play, don't play to win I play to show
Yeah! I'm The Maestro!

[Interlude]
Ahh yeh I need a little bit of cooperation right about now
I'd like to find out, who's favorite detective it is
{"Who is this?"} Is it Mannix? Barnaby Jones?
Sombody say Columbo.. Mickey Mulroney?
Is it Cannon.. Barnaby Jones?
I said that already

[Outro]
Yeah that's right ya'll
You know I got my own shit
See this ain't America's Most.. Wanted
This is America's Most.. Mackin!
That's right other people all call it, my hit!
When I get on there is no stoppin!!
{"Who is this?"}
{"Who is the man who is the man who is the man"}
{"Who is the man who is the man who is the man"}
{"Who is the man who is the man.."}

Who is that? Yo, he is, the maestro
Who is the man? What, uhh, The Maestro
Yeah, yeah, The Maestro
Give it up, The Maestro
He is The Maestro!</pre>
