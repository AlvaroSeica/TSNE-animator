[Chorus]
They don't know, though they need to
Somebody better tell 'em, and it may just be you
They can't feel, what we go through
Cause I'm too busy bein' me, and you too busy bein' you

[repeat Chorus]

[Eligh]
A burning Bush in the office
Equals death upon us, find this man
Fighting wars in the desert
On the TV sets across the land
Deep beneath the sands
To get that black load up to fill the cans
Killing common man with hand grenades to find a free sedan
Daddy told his son, "Little boy, you about to get revenge
Gotta finish what I started, no more time for makin' friends
Internal Revenue Service gonna help us with the funds
I sold my soul to the devil so you know we got the guns
You got to run the government like a tyrant, keep firing like I did
Keeping hiring media circus clowns to work the crowds
So most Americans sirens servin' up information
think that they've got the lowdown
Hoe-down, no more mercy, come now
My son, you know we got the nuclear power to control the globe
So hold this war in secret, but keep in plain view
So once you bring destruction nobody can blame you"
Now look at these guys in office, looking to rise on top us
Bringin' demise in a magnum opus of hopeless war psychosis
You're never safe from the ignorant of the world, now that's the focus
[Focus, focus, focus, focus, focus]

[Chorus]

[Very]
I accept people as who they are
People, no more, no less
Expect only to please myself and shoot for the best
Enjoy your life
There's no need for me to focus on death
So expect to be healthy, avoid stress
I'm blessed with the understanding that you and I share this planet
So as long as we livin' we got to manage
Learnin' the truth and livin' through it ain't easy but I'ma do it
And my sense of common sense keep it movin' [keep it movin']
Since I opened my doors, man, I ain't been the same since
Life just ain't the same, should I blame this?
Energy my entertainment, I can't miss
Opportunity, it can't quit, I can't quit
Shiftin' my circumstance
Open my all advance
Ignorin' every option is to take a chance
Extend the borders high, 'cuz they extend out
In efforts of catchin' somethin' I can learn about
You see, I don't want anyone to get the wrong impression
Why you lookin' so dismissive to me; listen, man
You can't tell who I am; I skimmin' over the surface
See, I'm a person with purpose to rock shit
Please don't be naïve enough to believe the stuff you hear or see about me
You don't even know me, man
Still they do, so I said a message in vessels
Investigate it, and you might just get to learn somethin'

[Chorus]

[Eligh]
Survivin' in the big city makes you old too fast
Livin' in the country, can't kick them backwards ways
Hidin' out in the suburbs, you think you got the best of both worlds
But open your eyes, you still trudgin' this maze
Republican or democrat, it's just a flip of the coin
And once you join it's just another ???
Knowin' their promise is crazy you act all amazed
Like, I can't believe we're livin' in such ??? ways
Everybody's causin' the shuffle or part o' the hustle
Some choose mind over matter, others make it matter with muscle
There's no escapin' the machine we livin' in
We all sprinkets and sprockets
The hard the job is, the more they got us givin' in way past the evening
While the government's cashin' in
We catchin' wind, and ladies and gentlemen
What we smellin' I'm telling'; they promisin'
The powers in the people
But it's like the people whooped the skeleton to gelatin
??? to Allah and then come in and sin
The condiments are part of the scene
Turkeys and collard greens and minorities and, yeah, you know what I mean
Oh yeah, they know
But they ain't budgin'
Until somebody go up there and blow up somethin'
It may be you, to bring the discussions
To primetime news but until then they frontin' like

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
