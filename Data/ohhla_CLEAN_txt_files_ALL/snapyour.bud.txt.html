[Intro: Buddha Monk]
They just keep running they mouth
They just keep running they mouth
Ya'll cats get your watches ready
Cuz this one right here is done in, you know?
The time is up, the last Zu, nigga
Duc-Lo Records, it's about to begin

[Buddha Monk]
Yo, I, came with the melody, that slowly pierce the eardrum
Then added on the flow, that the God is only known for
And the radio, "New Music by Buddha Monk"
It was that, joint at the party, that made those titties jump
And now it's mixed with; 'now you caught my heart for the evening'
Yo, turn around, and look at those girls screaming
Man, was I dreaming, was it me I was finally hearing
Backyard parties and gin colored streaming
Check the billboard, it's number one on every shore
Knock, knock, who is it, hun, it's Buddha at the door
State of art on the wall, looking at the television
It's Buddha Monk receiving a Soul Train Award
Ya'll give him applause, can you come back and sing one more
Are you kidding, I was born to be on these hall of fame walls
Man... are you kidding, I was born to be on these hall of fame walls

[Chorus 2X: Buddha Monk]
I've been, so many places, seen so many faces
But none looks greater than the one you now facing
Snap your close up, I'm here to answer or refuse
Ladies show them thongs, niggas cock back your tools

[Buddha Monk]
Yeah, it's true I'm understand, but after you hear this one
You gon' turn around and say 'thank God, somebody related'
It's Buddha option, take a good sniff down your nostrils
Cuz for sure, this one right here is hot too
It's that, backdoor gospel, made from the most dirtiest streets
If you stick me, get two-two slugs, just got you
So if you with me, huh, cuz what I got planned for this rap game
Is to take over the shit and make all ya'll lose ya fame
I'm that warrior, and I came to take what's rightfully mine
It's Zu time to shine, and the bottom line, clear the path, nigga
Or you gonna feel the nine, and this ain't
Just one of them rap niggas just to make a rhyme, you know?

[Chorus 2X]

[Buddha Monk]
Giving the lime lights, for the best shit you heard tight
Play it around the world, I'd rather dance with the girl
And fuck manage tois, I want a mansion and the bar
So I can get drunk and like those nasty ass broads
What you think I'm playing? When this rap game is changing
Nah it be the God here to pull all your cards
Don't get tossed around, you put a gun in any mouth
Yo, shut the fuck up, they ran that ass from down south

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Buddha Monk]
Haha, Duc-Lo Records, about to begin
Agent Stealth, Buddha Monk, Mr. Tibbs
North Star, my nigga G, can't forget the most wanted
Look at the list, K-Blunt, 5 Foot Hyper Sniper
Popa Chief, aiyo, aiyo, ahh, never mind</pre>
