Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Watch the real niggaz celebrate
All the real niggaz selling weight
Watch the real niggaz celebrate

[Chorus]
I swear to God, that's on my kids
Every day that I'm alive, I gotta live
For every gangster ever died or did a bid
Where I'm from, when niggaz ride, they kill it quick
Flipping bricks, counting money, so repetitious
Highly decorated gangster, so keep a distance
Swear to God, that's on my kids, better mind your business
Five grand'll get you killed, what's a life sentence?
Life sentence, huh!

[Verse 1]
I'm paranoid cause I'm in the Porsche
In the projects, sitting on a brick of boy
I swear to God, this d! ck could change your life
So grab your bags, it's time to catch a flight
I levitate on all these pussy niggaz
I never hate on all these pussy niggaz
My tax bracket on some other shit
I could put you on that mothership

[Chorus]
I swear to God, that's on my kids
Every day that I'm alive, I gotta live
For every gangster ever died or did a bid
Where I'm from, when niggaz ride, they kill it quick
Flipping bricks, counting money, so repetitious
Highly decorated gangster, so keep a distance
Swear to God, that's on my kids, better mind your business
Five grand'll get you killed, what's a life sentence?
Life sentence, huh!

[Verse 2]
Start winning, niggaz wanna whisper in the dark
Spray the driver's side window when the Lincoln park
I think these niggaz out here reading lips
Salty, we the only niggaz eating chips
Gotta separate from all these pussy niggaz
You could never hesitate and you's a pussy, nigga
We started off dead broke
Now I got forty million in a fucking yoke
I got four million in my boat
All jokes aside, a few million in my ho
Double M, know the G's, nigga
On Colombia, sipping mojitos with leaves, nigga

[Chorus]
I swear to God, that's on my kids
Every day that I'm alive, I gotta live
For every gangster ever died or did a bid
Where I'm from, when niggaz ride, they kill it quick
Flipping bricks, counting money  so repetitious
Highly decorated gangster, so keep a distance
Swear to God, that's on my kids, better mind your business
Five grand'll get you killed, what's a life sentence?
Life sentence, huh!

[Verse 3]
Rose-gold Jesus, rose-gold watch
All-black Ghost, all-black Glock
Three new flows, that's off top
All white squares, the city on lock
I swear to God, I need a hundred m's
Til the day I die, I plan to represent
Hold your heads high, we had a nice run
Let the bankers know we have just begun
I broke the mold, my total assets
Will get you assholes left in the past tense
I broke the mold in every aspect
I'll get you assholes left in the past tense

[Chorus]
I swear to God, that's on my kids
Every day that I'm alive, I gotta live
For every gangster ever died or did a bid
Where I'm from, when niggaz ride, they kill it quick
Flipping bricks, counting money  so repetitious
Highly decorated gangster, so keep a distance
Swear to God, that's on my kids, better mind your business
Five grand'll get you killed, what's a life sentence?
Life sentence, huh!</pre>
