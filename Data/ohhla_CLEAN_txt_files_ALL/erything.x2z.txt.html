[Intro]
Yeah, YEAH!!
Yeah, now

[Chorus One: Xzibit]
I was on the block pitchin rocks at 15
And I remember underage drinkin at 16
Let my nuts hang, Cali bang at 17
Now I got everything, bitch I got everything

[Xzibit]
My back was to the wall, risked it all, after all, all I had was me
Just tenacity, some Olde E with a Swisher Sweet
Now everything I ride around got a captain's seat
Fuck y'all, draw a sawed-off and dump rapidly
Partner now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions
The opportunist, the Judas movin on my position
But I'm a heavyweight humble hittin the heavy bag
Waitin for the day I stumble across yo' fuckin ass
Then I'll put some work in, chip half your chest off
Pickin this shit up where I left off
You wet soft and sensitive, too timid to tangle with the Los Angel'
I admit it, I bullshitted, gave you the wrong angle
Now have a seat at my table, let me give you the business
Diversify yo' millions, you can live off the interest
Make every revenue stream flood, see where it took me
And make that money stack higher than giraffe pussy

[Chorus One]

[Xzibit]
I used to have a Glock that I would shoot through a backpack
So I wouldn't leave no shells at the scene when I was gettin my get-back
Yeah, this for the homie Wack, roll through and chop it up
On how to make the West divided a united front
Burn big, light it up, waitin on that Bentley truck
So I can crush the corner; welcome to California
where people fake it 'til they make it or take it with a handgun
Take your chances, swing, try to land one
Now you in a box like a Samsung, I +March+ through the +Madness+
My symphony deliver somethin classic
Either you iron clad or you plastic, jumped in or drafted
Either way you gotta salute a flag, who you rollin with?
I acknowledge honest with whole-hearted integrity
People keep tellin me I'm 'bout to catch a felony
Stage presence reminiscent of a flashbang
Gave my girl a son and my last name, yeah

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: Xzibit]
Ain't talkin 'bout the yachts, the Bentley coupe or the mansions
I'm sayin you can't knock me off the square that I stand in
Nobody gave me nothin, this is just where I landed
Cause now I got everything, bitch I got everything

[Xzibit]
Motherfucker my livin room look like a drive-in
When I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins
Nothin but respect when I walk through the lion's den
Because I kill everything, bitch I kill everything
Nothin ever compares with the strength of a free mind
You'll find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind
Use it to fight for your freedom, and oppress your oppressors
When you mold 'em and lead 'em, fuck a positive message!
This is a lifetime of lessons, boiled down to the essence
There's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence
Make every revenue stream flood, look where it took me
And make that money stack higher than giraffe pussy

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]
