(Intro, DJ Paul &amp; [DJ Scream])
[We weigh our money]
Money makers in the building!
[We swipe black cards]
Bad bitches bout the chewin!
[And we ballin nigga, no budget]
DJ Paul; K.O.M!
[And DJ Black, Nigga believe that]

(Hook, DJ Paul &amp; Ya Boy)
I smoke chips; I cop whips
I count hundreds; Ain't life a bitch?
New day; New check
New money; Rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
Get off a rich nigga dick
Rich nigga shit; I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
Get off a rich nigga dick

(Verse 1, Ya Boy)
Rich nigga shit; Yo man isn't this
Gucci cologne; I smell dope like I'm sniffin bricks
Money in my jeans; Heavy on the scene
We sell niggas P's; We sell bitches dreams
Sippin purple lean; Movin snail slow
Send yo man a message; No cell phone
My niggas got stripes; No shell toes
Put you in a box, and I ain't talkin where the mail go
Fourty stacks on my wrist; Nigga kill yourself
Hot like the 9/11 planes; Make the building melt
My coupe stupid; My Range Rove' ignorant
Fuck what it cost, gimme two; Rich nigga shit

(Hook)
I smoke chips; I cop whips
I count hundreds; Ain't life a bitch?
New day; New check
New money; Rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
Get off a rich nigga dick
Rich nigga shit; I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
Get off a rich nigga dick

(Verse 2, DJ Paul)
I'll show ya how a rich nigga DO IT
Spend a hundred-K one weekend, like get used to it
And nigga, that's light weekend...
Don't ya wish ya was my best friend?
But nah nigga, you da enemy!
Cause yo bitch ass so strongly envy me
You tell me I gets them new cars, that sit well
Kinda like, you ain't Mexican on them fish scales
And nigga, now ya ass runnin off
I'm in the party, plus headed to Vegas to fuck money off
Cause nigga, that's how we do
Pretty ho's with long hair is part of our crew

(Hook)
I smoke chips; I cop whips
I count hundreds; Ain't life a bitch?
New day; New check
New money; Rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
Get off a rich nigga dick
Rich nigga shit; I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
Get off a rich nigga dick

(Verse 3, Juicy J)
(We trippy mane!)
I live like a kingpin; Tony Montana
I made my way through life pullin back the hammer [Gunshot]
My back yard like to be deserved; Full of freaks (BITCH!)
Straight from Magic City; Georgia Peaks (You know it!)
Flipped the Maserati; Into a Ferarri (Wooo!)
And a twenty-twelve Maybach big-body (Wooo!)
They think I'm "Money Mayweather"; I don't do boxin (No sir!)
But a nigga do ball, and the streets watchin (Yes sir!)
Yo money long? My money longer...
And I smoke that Cali Kush; My weed is stronger
Paper still stackin; Been coulda stopped rappin (You know it!)
I'm a legend in this game (Ho!); Reggie Jackson

(Hook)
I smoke chips; I cop whips
I count hundreds; Ain't life a bitch?
New day; New check
New money; Rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
Get off a rich nigga dick (Bitch!)
Rich nigga shit; I'm talkin rich nigga shit
I'm talkin rich nigga shit
Get off a rich nigga dick</pre>
