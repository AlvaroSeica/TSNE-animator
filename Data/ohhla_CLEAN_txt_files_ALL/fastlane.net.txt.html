[Syd Tha Kid]
Drivin in my car
Damn near cut me off
And now you're in the fast lane
So you better not slow me down
And I refuse to change my direction
So you best make up your mind
Before I get caught in the intersection
and minor traffic lights

[Chorus]
Sending me mixed signals
Get right or get left
Don't seem like you're ready
So just get out my way
70 in six
Get right or get left
Don't tell me you're sorry
Just get out my lane
You're slowin me down {*2X*}

[Syd Tha Kid]
And now we're moving faster, you're catching up to speed
And yes your car looks good to me - and you know it
Don't try to speed off, like I didn't teach you, well you know
Are you ready for the open road?

[Chorus]

You're slowin me down {*2X*}

[Syd Tha Kid]
Warning signs were there, but we never cared
So we crashed, and learned a lesson
And to take care of the damage
We need to admit that accidents happen
So if it's cool with you I'll just be on my way</pre>
