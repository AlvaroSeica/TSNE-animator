[ CHORUS ]
This ain't no check shirt, skinny jeans, hipster tip
It's that neck jerk, swigging Beam, official shit
Bombing hard as Nagasaki when the missile hit
So get your face screwed up and let's get into it
Turn your speakers up loud
If you're with me get your reefer bunned down
This is ain't a joke, nah but we keep it bugged out
Middle finger stiff, bitch what you think of Stig now?

[ VERSE 1 ]
Just watch, I kill it right from the jump-off
Back at like crack addicts in a drug spot
Team Hate, stay screaming "Fuck pop"
The deadliest click you never heard since a gun cocked
Blaow - I'm in the house like I left somethin
Blowing doja dope enough to get my chest bugging
My old man told me shy kids get nothing
So get ya war face on and get stuck in
So now I'm going all out
Building up a rep and steady getting more clout
Piff, drink, tatted up skanks
And Art Over Money, so you know what I'm about
No doubt, I'm a problem with an attitude
Strapping zoots until my lungs are black as Papa Lazarou
School bully of the scene, I'ma slap a few
Rappers, til I'm knackered, then I sit back and laugh at you

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Roll a blunt up to this and take a couple hits
Ain't nobody on a beat that come as tough as Stig
But opinions are like arseholes, trust me kid
Everybody's got one, usually they're full of shit
Scruffy kicks and pint, that's me
Lies about how you clap heat, that's you
Snuffing kids with right hand, that's me
Hold your mouth when I roll through or get the snooze button
Cause this is grown man business
You want a verse, you gotta pay for the privilege
I got the critics thinking "What the fuck is this?"
Music for the misfits, moving through ya district
Super glue your lips quick, say Nathan
You know the crew, me and Team stay Hating
You don't wanna see me lose my patience
I'm Bruce Banner with the grammar after gamma radiation

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Raw northern brawler type, born to perform on mics
Overweight, no debate, but fly like Orville Wright
Bored of life, talking hype, tryna cause a fight
So if your wanna throw fists better up your portion size
Drink the bar dry before they're calling time
Then hit the offie for the fortified wine
Antisocial, far from a normal guy
So kick rocks and watch the floor when I'm walking by
I'm the twinkle in your daughter's eye
Just the sound of my voice got her wetter than a water pipe
Hardcore, I never pen a corny line
So when I press record the rest fall behind
Always talking shite, it's what I'm entertained by
My whole attitude is never say die
Heavyweight rhymes that could devastate lives
I'm the best that ever did it, let me demonstrate why
