[Wafeek]
Yeah, who got the bitches shakin it?
Who got the b-boys breakin it?
Look at my niggaz makin it
It goes on and on and on until the break of dawn
Until the break of dawn {*2X*}
On on and on and onnnn
From the day I'm born
Until the day I'm gone
It's light, until the break of dawn
On on and on and onnnn

Yeah, I keep it Dilla all day
Now religional convention the day that you die
you gon' have to face a big white guy in the sky
I'ma tell you why they tryin to lie
It's cause they sold out, and they dyin inside
I decided to rhyme the same time Dilla sided with Tribe
And now I'm into Mingus like the sign of the times
I know I ain't the only nigga out of his mind
Yeah I'm spiritual I feel as though a lot of y'all blinded
by the science in yo' eyes so I gotta remind ya
That God probably got a vagina
Cause men don't listen to a word she say
And I couldn't see a grown nigga livin in no pearly gates
But hey, these are worldly things and ideas
and got nothin to do with who God is
See life is a test, I'ma let y'all live
And in death will reflect over what y'all did

Yeah, who got the bitches shakin it?
Who got the b-boys breakin it?
Look at my niggaz makin it
It goes on and on and on until the break of dawn
Until the break of dawn {*2X*}
On on and on and onnnn
I keep it Dilla all day

To the break of dawn
On on and on and onnnn
I keep it Dilla all day</pre>
