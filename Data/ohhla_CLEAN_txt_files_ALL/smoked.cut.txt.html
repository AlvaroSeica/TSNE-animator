{Hook: (8x)Lord Infamous}
I'm smoked out snorted out 
drunken and I'm blown

{DJ Paul}
get the dope, chop it up 
get the plate, I can't wait
fifth of henn, in my hand 
ask for some, you too late 
now I'm high, really high 
man I'm about to shout 
I see you over there talking 
but what the fuck you talking about 
oh I'm blazed, in a daze 
purple haze and ash trays 
Mac Mike you got the light 
we green this ain't no fucking day 
black Havana 
craving the vapors of chronic 
DJ P with no weed and know what 
this shit is so fucking ironic

{Juicy J}
I got them blood shot red eyes 
look into my eyes 
did you see a big surprise 
can't you tell a nigga high 
I can fly, I can float 
meet your boy up on the boat 
watch me dive into the water 
like Titanic when it broke 
yo keep the weed coming 
keep them drinks coming 
niggas walking around 
in that daze like they need something 
cream bumming 
lighters flicking 
on the road their ain't no finish 
send them back 
stop in the kitchen 
nigga this is just the beginning

{Hook: (8x)Lord Infamous}
Im smoked out snorted out 
drunken and I'm blown

{Lord Infamous}
hearses circling my house 
with wack ass rappers in the rear 
hella lame in my ear 
I come to ruin your career 
vocal cords swords 
side board more souvenir 
skins of belly body 
smelly death is in the atmosphere 
peace is extinct 
bloody street 
make them steal 
planes crash ships sink 
every poison gets sweet 
every enemy see 
feel the nuclear nigga heat 
may I propose a toast 
its coming close to World War III 
fright night 
under moonlight 
Memphis picture 
mutilating torture pressure 
till the Satan took ya 
I'll beat ya till there's nothing left but slop 
feed you to the swamp 
running thru the forest like gunk  
bloody tree trunk 
bitch you want a piece of this 
might as well take the heart 
there was no love from the start 
sprinkle body parts 
woe onto you my foe 
cause you just don't know 
smoked out snorted drunk blown

{Hook: (8x)Lord Infamous}
I'm smoked out snorted out 
drunken and I'm blown

{Twista}
got me gone off herb
and I earn when I swerve to the curb 
for the derb and the bourbon 
fresh out early and 
hanging with the soldiers 
still got the feelings that we pearling 
show me where they working 
from the bank dawg 
money on a fifth of henn 
tell the motherfucker drink up 
why the skunk weed starting to stank dawg 
bitch go and get some gin 
we gonna get the party cranked up 
put your bank up we gonna need more 
weefer chain cause our cryptic addicted to weed smoke 
get incisions of pure seeded snow 
take a puff choke shit of this weed dope 
and I'm off my square now 
went and yelled out 
where the nigga trying to get sloppier 
dropping ya 
if you trying to get us  
while we uzing them 
rolling with the Three 6 mafia 
popping ya popular 
buck at niggas with the rock 
close encounters of the herb kind 
leave you sitting on the curb crying 
south side getting bucked up 
in a party with a burb mind 
we gonna tear this bitch up 
cause we fucked up 
gone off that sticky 
when I zone off cant hit me 
have me going in illusions 
trying to get me 
infatuated with drugs 
smoked out snorted out drunken and blown 
getting crunk in that mode 
Twista gotta stay high 
smoke a skunk till I'm old 
now chucking like im sea sick 
on the front porch with the mob 
and we be thick 
roll when you see Twista and Three 6 
who can bog the motherfucking mind 
like an eclipse on the weed tip</pre>
