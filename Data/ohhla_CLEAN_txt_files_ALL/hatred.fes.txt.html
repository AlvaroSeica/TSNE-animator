[Chorus: T-Bird]
Cuz they don't want me to shine
They know I'm fly and they don't want me to shine
They hating on me, and they don't want me to shine
They know I'm fly and they don't want me to shine
They hating on me

[Kay Yo]
Aiyo, it's my life, why they trying to take my life
Trying to be a good dude, it's these streets that's trife
Tell them officers to back up off me
Been stalking 'em, since that Impala saw me
Shit, just trying to pull up to the rib
Sirens been wilding, what these kids done did
Another body walked around, get chalked around
People hawk around, latest talk in town
Block to block like Monopoly
Them bad apples to the core, rotten seeds
It's been time to teach the youth, preach the truth
Straight positive, negative get the boot
I'm on my prison, know they father was the shit
Now inhale and exhale, I'm heavy when I spit
Got the grip like rubber handles, hard to handle
Cuz man can do, worn out and got a rubberband you
I'm that new doc, new shots, new block, new money, what?

[Fes Taylor]
Ain't nothing better than new gwop, nigga
Yo, from New York to Pittsburgh, the way I snitch words
Fiip birds like skateboards, hitting the curbs
Shit I osberve, more than I preserve
I sat patiently just waiting my turn
I'm the perfect representation from Staten Island
My struggle, my hunger, maturity grew since I was younger
Slumber party, yeah, they slept on niggas
Til I, pump the shotty, when they crept on niggas
If he, block the right jab, the left on niggas
And if a fight turn to gunplay, we teflon niggas
The south run the hip hop? What you expect, damn
I guess Def Jam got the ears of a deaf man
Put your career in the hands of a next man
New York my birthplace, kinda like Bethelehem
I'm the game saviorm and I leave my signature
On your face with a straight razor, nigga
You ain't major, you a minor league player
Need I say more niggas?

[T-Bird]
You can tell if a man's real if you look in they eyes
I can see them haters hating from the look in they eyes
An underground nigga, now I'm just looking to rise
This is what hip hop lacks, I"m just here to provide
If 50 shots'll subtract, Sean Bell be alive
If hip hop was dead, I'm the air that can keep it alive
That nigga said he wasn't a cop, when they asked him, he lied
This is just some shit on my mind, I think about when I'm high
I'm naturally fly, my swagger is catching your eye
Nobody got these Jordans I got, I'm exclusively fly
This is for all my hustlers hustling, dog, stay on your grind
Came from the bottom, but now I'm at the top of the line
I'm tired of dudes that can't properly rhyme, that's why I constantly blind
And show these niggas they ain't fucking with mine
My life is more than a rap song, I got kids
So knowledge to them I pass on, I'm hoping they blast on

[Flip]
It's a matter of time, so I see no need to hold my breath
Don't test on the strength that ya'll don't know my stress
I don't rest, so there's way you can slow my steps
I got a team, I be working on my solo flex
At 16, I was spitting over old cassettes
Microphones made out of headphones and broken decks
So broke, I was always calling home collect
I rock no soles, plus I got no respect
Nearly blessed, always seem to keep a soul impress
Now he equal, but we leaders in our respects
I can remembe when I started this, my sole intent
Was to release all of the anger, that my soul has pent
Cuz I was never meant to make it, I was so just spent
Til I stepped into the game and left a sole imprint
Burning incent, flipping, spitting since an infant
Hard not to believe me, I can be pretty convincing
