Typed by: AZ Lyrics

One shot two shot who's that boppin that rocky boy sound
One shot, two shot, man down, clan down
Who's that kid on the poster posting
Posted like the coastguard on the ocean
Wicked slick shit no devotion
Just sick shit no slick promotion
The extraordinary?
The president of emissary
The secretary of state, the secretary of flow
The secretary of glow, it's necessary to show
That I can make the motherfuckers mouth stay closed
(Row row row) kick it, got my ballys on I'm in zone gettin wicked
Laughin at you clones from the throne gettin lifted
Lyrically literally shittin on these niggas man
I'm from the city where the thingsll hold the trigger man
Where it can get live, any minute and,
And the choppers chop a hole in the door of your minivan [x3]
Therefore, I ain't worried bout any man
Or any clan or mini mini man
That wanna get busy, yes sir
You fuckin with the truest
Young black jewish
New new newest [x3]
In the hood where you is
Rollin dice with the loot
[?]
I got the whole day off like ferris bueller
You can take that to the jeweler
And get fifty thousand gallons of blood out of the zulus
[?]
You a modern day judas
I'm walkin on water and I ain't wettin the shoelace
So you ain't sayin nothin with your grill and your screwface

Gucci prada and vera wang
Won't help to rebuild a city after a hurricane
Your house and your spouse
Your two car garage, the spinners under the range
Lead a nigga to believe he mastered the game
And if you don't have any of the above said material goods than you inferior
Chickens say your lame
So niggas go rob a liquor store to get em a chain
Shoot up a house party for nothin to get em a name
Like convict, dopeman, oh that's them niggas
And if you think they're really happy go and ask them niggas
I promise you theyll lie
Position they fingers to throw they hood up in the sky
To tell you man look I
Know what I'm doin is wrong but how can I survive
And when they hear songs like this to get by they cry
For a split second
Then it's back the snappin they fingers to that hit record
Let's meditate for a second</pre>
