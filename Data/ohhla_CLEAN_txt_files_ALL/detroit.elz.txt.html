It's Elmatic
It's Elmatic
Yeah, I'ma start this shit off man

Yo, rappers I monkey-flip 'em, gorilla-stomp 'em
I'm out here with the dealers pumping, the killers dumping
dead bodies in Lake Michigan that shake fisherman
Pimps turn into pastors, the fake bishops in the churches
Impostors determine of which you purchase
or who you murked just, a week ago dug up from searches
and police raids, increase grades, someone deceased made
the front page, the priest prayed he went to Heaven
But the beast stayed, now it's a war, and flowers for more
funerals, you see who's soon to go a few hours before
It's just the same story
They cutting more keys when someone ODs in the same building on the same story
It's that ruthless drug addict who's toothless, turned doofus
Responsible for how the wasted youth is
who run up in your shop and steal, popping pills
At a house party with a hoodrat copping feels
Fucked her raw, mentality's like fuck the law
Nowadays niggas buck when they would have snuffed ya jaw
In the shittiest schemes where money is power
and shots go off at the funniest hours
Now it's, breaking news, it's best that you stay awake than snooze
They taking lives or they taking shoes
I jot it down like I'm Langston Hughes, and paint a picture
in my good book that's full of verses that ain't a scripture
nor, from a religion, judges put men under the prison
Them shorties screaming they riders, but ain't none of 'em driven
I try to school 'em cause they dropped out
Once they popped out the pussy they mad because they pussy pops out
Now they a bastard, life can be fatal in the hazard
from the cradle to the casket
I'm rightfully raised around a life of crime, snitches dropping dimes
I think of rhymes when I'm in a Detroit state of mind

[Chorus: 4X]
"Detroit", "state of mind"

[Elzhi]
Yo, be having dreams that I'm a gangster, sipping on bottles of Rose
Chilling with my out of town connect named Jose
Tryna hustle for mo' pay, police in my doorway
I never have my head in the clouds cause they could go gray
and, that ain't my forte
So fuck a job, and who I stuck and robbed just the other day
Who's listening to what they mother say about finishing school, to get they GED
when crackheads is tryna sling an HDTV for rocks and snort?
The fast life is why the time on ya clocks is short
Even the shorties pulling Glocks from they boxer shorts
Rap sheet be so long that it shocks the courts
It's why we called the Murder City, tip a stripper then you can purr the kitty
Bad Boys before we'd heard of Diddy
Word to Maserati Rick, Demetrius Holloway
and those who celebrate by bussing guns on a holiday
Happy to see another year, and it begin
Was told to watch for enemies that pretend to be friends
They hit you with the setup, I've seen it all with my own two
The hood is like a glasshouse the Devil throws stones through
Many will stress off the Henny or sess
Maybe because the city's built above where Indians rest
in peace, police found deceased, it's hair-raising like Kelis
D-boys hot and working they fleece, and bubble geese
I knew this fly chick, pretty right, she was my type
That crack shit wasn't hype, she fell in love with the pipe
She had dreams, being the next D. Ross or the Supremes
Overdosed in the lot between the plot and the schemes

[Chorus: 8X]

[Interlude]
"Yo El', what's good? It's 'Shoes
 Congratulations brother, for finally bringing it to fruition, Elmatic
 It's been a long road since uh, since I hollered at you over in Europe about three years ago
 Like El' man, you need to re-, you should just remake Illmatic
 It only makes sense, you know what I'm saying? Elzhi, Elmatic
 This shit came out miles beyond what I thought it ever could have been
 I'm very proud brother, classic, classic fucking project
 Let's keep it moving onto the next one man
 Holla at ya boy man, peace"</pre>
