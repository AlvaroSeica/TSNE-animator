[Intro] [Rise talking]
What it is people? Yo, they wanna know. Why, how, when, who? The purpose
That's what it's about
So I'm here with the Avid Record Collector, this evening
And we gonna...Yo fuck it

[Verse One]
Rise is the name and likewise the motto
Till the right turn to gain
The highs, mids and bottom
Your game killed by volume or subpar releases
A rapper every two feet that thinks he can freak it
A studio in every PC, easy recording
Projects 80 floors, 90 labels every story
But the hustle I don't knock
Minorities paid
And enjoy the segue way between cradle to grave
From the naval we ate, once it's cut you're alone
So my dogs bury they bones in the girlies in Rome (that's right)
Rats in a maze with no time to stall
Smellin' the cheese but eat through the wall
I grind like I'm cinnamon, captivatin' topics
But y'all would rather listen to Andy Milonakis
So I'm leanin' on the wall, hands in my pockets
Holdin' onto keys while you struggle with the lock pick 
Rise

[Scratch Chorus] [x4]
"Go put the word out, y'all know who's back in town"
Rise

[Verse Two]
Who is it?
It's the ceremony master, the poetry king
The oratory emperor, the czar of the zings
The breath of nice air, from nowhere when it's smelly
Since a high chair been a nightmare with Freddy
The, fuck the fashion, the rules of expire
The drunken dragon, fuelin' the fire
The link missin', relate but think different
So sync spittin', these puppets are lip syncing 
The ships sinkin', the cries of people grieving
The Audacity of Dope, the change you can believe in
The crew soaks though they party in storms (Why?)
The tomb's open, the body is gone
The Icarus, nigga rich, fightin' the old fight
Faith is takin' step without seein' the whole flight
The synonym for growth
Conscious in the mornin'
My johnson when I'm whorin'
The monster that's recordin'
Rise

[Scratch Chorus] [x4]
"Go put the word out y'all know who's back in town"
Rise

[Verse Three]
It's the calm, the composure while rackin' my brain
What if the light at the end of a tunnel is a train?
Worried about my posse/team, workin' out to Rocky Themes
Martin on the mountain, Dream, waters on the fountain stream
Up, then they fall, then they circle, repeat
What reaches to the clouds must return to the street
Just to bounce to the stars, build momentum and speed
Or you'll come out for a second, with no mention, you'll leave
Everybody's on the "me", I'm the atlas indeed
Maps for Jack to trade the family cat for magical beans
I'ma come up, increase, climb mount, get higher
Ascend, overthrow, float, escalate, the flier
Levitate, soar, to rocket or despite
The jump to dunk all height like the price of gas and mice
To come up
Like waters in a volatile sea
(And what else)
An EP by an army of me
It's Rise
