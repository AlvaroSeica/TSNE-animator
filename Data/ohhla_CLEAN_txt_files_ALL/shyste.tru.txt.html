[Hook: Jhaz]
Shyste niggas be tryin' to fade me
Nope, I don't

[Brina]
Niggas be tryin' to test us
Don't wanna see this here showdown
Shyste niggas be trying to fade me

[Jhaz]
Shyste niggas be tryin' to fade me
Nope I don't
And with this bullshit I cannot cope
You played me once too many times, and it's over with
Dumb trick shit, I can't stand a shyste bitch
But anyway, let's take this into deeper visions
A nigga quick to play ya, is shyste's definition
Better watch your back, 'cause shyste ones have many faces
Buck quick shyste bitch ain't go no love for them aces
And a nigga bring it on 'cause I got plenty of bangin'
That's the cut to (pay me back up), so you knows I don't give a fuck
But, shit, as sista' down for whatever
But shystiness just gets to me - a fuckin' mental terror
Clearer are my visions, shyste ones I see right through you
On my Ps and Qs, plus I'm immune to your voodoo
Fool, you cannot handle me, tell me how did you figure?
Straight from the Clair, in here with Cliffview, on the topic of shyste niggas

[Brina]
Shyste nigga you figured you could fade me
Cluckas that try to test underestimate a thorough lady up in this game
'Cause I done struggled in these streets
Done had too many chumps going against the grain
Tryin' to compete, playa hate in my hood, runnin' they mouth like bitches
All these smiling faces that's doubtin' the camp
Well, figures, wanna be obstacles
But couldn't stop us, from hittin' them levels
Shyste fools gon' dis you, no matter if you do better, I'm a go-getter
Don't let no bustas stop no show
Sista gon' do her thang, gon' run game, and stack some dough
Pack the chrome pump, sister strapped at all times
Ain't no gangsta comin' off shady gon' make me handle mine

(Hook)

[Jhaz]
Now check this nigga with a mouthpiece, undercover shyste bitch
Although you claim to be down
I find you only stick and dig trick with game
But eventually, all become recognized
Eighty-six a bitch who a shyste one, best break up all ties
Got no remorse, breakin' 'em off, puttin' an end to all this
You see my mind begins to click
When a shyste one's in my presence
Insane, I think not, as a matter of fact I got much that's on that other level
I done peeped all of your shystiness come to mentals
The cards on the table, your hands be ? as you envision the game
But bitch you fucked with them pros
I got my nina, Brina hollerin', so you know I got my gauge
Caught up in the game so it ain't shit for a sista to flip anyway
I'm steady ? blastin' ass
Come on over with your crew
Got clips for days, and I'm high ?
Sistas don't give a fuck about you
So bring whatever, clever you think your plan may be
My mentals way too tight, and I hate a nigga that's shyste

(Hook)

[Brina]
Tryin' to fade a sista, they got hard-game, playa
You must didn't catch the ? then think back to verse one
Son, 'cause all games ain't the same when ya
Tryin' to run up in a nigga for digital figures
Thinkin' you gettin' (over unnoticed, undercover gold-digger)
Shyste moves prove your hands can't be trusted for nothin'
So let's stop frontin', ? this ain't for blood
'Cause we start ? turn in your ho-cards, since damage is done
Best believe they don't how to, son, better off on the run them ho-cards
I don't deal, when shakin' your hand is a must
Fool, tryin' to play games with this pay, to get paid you'll get schooled
On the real, chill them shyste-type skills before me come thrashin'
Too late to be askin' for the second chance
'Gon see the life flashin' for being shyste
Gettin' a little too pricey to stay calm
'Cause you should've left thangs hang the way they was, but you chose not to
So I gots to pull back my trigger finger
Because me really don't give a fuck about a shyste nigga
