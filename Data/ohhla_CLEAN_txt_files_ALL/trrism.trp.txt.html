[Intro &amp; Chorus]
And now what... say what
It's Looptroop, rockers... once again

What's the difference, what's the similarity
We all search forgiveness, search for inner clarity
Minor differences - major similarities
Looptroop, the terrorist group

[Verse One]
The explosion would detonate, the sec felt like a decade
Before his death was definite
Visualize leaving his home - regretting it
But stuck in that world was even more threatening
I had to leave, picture me settled in I mean look at him
All Mr. Hyde and Dr. Jekyllin'
Daytime checking in, to make his paycheck come in
Licking his bosses balls, nobody got respect for him
Then when the weekend comes he can't speak, he's drunk
Beat on his wife, call her a cheating cunt
Then Easy-jetting down here with his dirty tourist dollars
Neo colonizing the poorest islands
And probably smuggling his little party drugs in
But unlike me, he's never stopped in customs
I had to fly away to make a change!

But the explosion would end all, shatter and devastate

[Chorus]
And then what? Ya'll gave up
What do we achieve, when we leave more
Like than we unlike, unlike what we like to believe
And so what? Y'all know what?
Despite class, color or creed  We more like than we unlike
Unlike what you like believe

[Verse Two]
The explosion was deafening
The mechanism glitched only for a second and..
One last time reflected on his predicaments
Stuck with no other option in this world's decadence
I had to make a change, it was evident
To protest against the president's ignorance
With his limited point of reference, it was making sense
So in a sense he was innocent
Your Glossy tourist brochure I live in it
But I ain't never saw the resorts you visiting
At night to stake take all sorts of prisoners
Assasinate and torture its citizens
You and your government reaps the dividents
Keep them in offices as long as they're diligent
You turn a deaf ear to the robbing and killing and
Separate the master race from the simians
See me as muslim I must be hustlin'
If I ever tried to leave I'd be stopped in customs
I'ma fight for freedom and break the chains

But the explosion would end all, shatter and devastate

[Chorus]
And then what? We gave up
What do we achieve, when we leave more
Like than we unlike, unlike what we like to believe
And so what? Y'all know what?
Despite class, color or creed  We more like than we unlike
Unlike what you like believe

[Verse Three]
Some people are tourists, some people are terrorists
Some know what a war is, some don't know what a hell it is
It's just something that they see on television
Turn that shit off right now, man you better listen!
Two lives, intertwined by the root
It might not have happened, it might not even be the truth
If so it wouldn't be the first time you swallow lies
But if it's wrong I'd be the first to apologize
I'm not here to judge, I wear the rugs of a wanderer
Searching the truth but I ain't on to her
Not even close but I boast a vivid imagination
Over a rhythm of desperation
Of the people that's forced to make changes
But are locked by conventional laws into cages
Becoming the labels the system gives them
Whether it's trrism or trrism

What's the difference, what's the similarities
We all search forgiveness, search for inner clarity
Minor differences - major similarities
Trying to shake the labels we inherited

And now what? We gave up
What do we achieve, when we leave more
Like than we unlike, unlike what we like to believe
And so what? Y'all know what?
Despite class, color or creed  We more like than we unlike
Unlike what you like believe

And now what? We gave up
What do we achieve, when we leave more
Like than we unlike, unlike what we like to believe
And so what? Y'all know what?
Despite class, color or creed  We more like than we unlike
Unlike what you like us to believe</pre>
