[Solo]
Hold up, let me backtrack through the catalogue
The scribbled thoughts of a good for nothing vagabond
Emcees is sheep, I'm a cattle dog
Herd 'em up and convert 'em like digital to analogue
From Sydney to Babylon and back, we on track
Tryna put that food for thought rap back on the map
Cause they hungry for some substance, I've seen in it their faces
They questioning the bargain, wanna know what's the basis
See some people say I think too much
So I had a think about it and I think that they should shut the fuck up
If I knew how to silence all the voices in my head
then I would, but I can't so I listen to 'em instead
And right now they telling me that I should be double checking your pedigree
Cause I ain't buying half what you're selling me
Elefant Traks got the rights to the Territory
and ain't a single person yet guessed the recipe
So we back in the kitchen just working on the flavours
Go on and help yourself now, don't be a stranger
Go on and shake what your mama nature gave ya
Let me see you on your baddest behaviour

[Chorus]
See when it's all said and done it's about more than fun
Cause there's still original thought left under the sun
We tryna get your mental moving in sync
and I'ma keep on doin' my think
See when it's all said and done it's about what was said
Girls move your bodies and the fellas nod they heads
We tryna notify your next of kin
All my people keep doin' your think
and raise your voice and sing

[Solo]
See there's music that makes you dance, music that makes you feel
No longer am I sure which one I think is more "real"
Cause if we could 50 Cent all our problems away
There'd be nothing left for the thinkers to say
But not today, so we back with some more rhymes
Can I interest anybody in a little bit of thoughtcrime?
If you sick of being taught what to like
Hypnotise you, that's why they play it all day and all night
So while they bumping watered down product on the airways
The truth ain't getting no airplay cause it ain't that catchy
But I'ma get it off the ground like an airplane
I'm flyer than Frank Abagnale, you can't +catch me+
So fingers crossed that they didn't notice that I had my fingers crossed
when I told 'em that they was the dopest
Cause I wouldn't wanna cause no offence
That's why I'm taking pot shots with my rifle while I'm sitting on the fence
Ayo we drop hot flows, rocking op-shop clothes
Probably catch me out the front a fucking cop shop stoned
Deep in thought, Kid Solo representing Horrorshow
And I'm out like I gots to go (now let's go)

[Chorus]

[Solo]
You can do it, put some thought into it, c'mon
I can do it, put some thought into it, c'mon
You can do it, put some thought into it, c'mon
I can do it, put some thought into it, c'mon
You can do it, put some thought into it, c'mon
I can do it, put some thought into it, c'mon

Put some thought into it {*repeat to end*}</pre>
