(skank it skank it)
Hey stoopid step inside
Hey stoopid come on and join the ride
Hey stoopid step inside
I said a stoopid dumb shit god damn motherfucker
Here a come a johnny with a pecker in his hand
I kyle
One more mother
Can not stand
I said I thought that those cowards said a cowards
Said I neva' neva' neva' neva' neva' wanna bet
I said why can't a punk
Just be dead
Why does he smile with a gun in his hand
Baby wanna come back
Maybe next year
But say I cannot tell ya baby where i'll be in a year
Because i'm stoopid
Step inside
Hey stoopid come on and join the ride
Hey stoopid step inside
I said a come along baby feel the rush inside
Hey stoopid
Step inside
Hey stoopid
Come on and join the ride
Hey stoopid
Stoopid dumb shit god damn motherfucker
Hey stoopid hey stoopid hey stoopid
Breakin' things
I'm breakin things
But I got better things to do
Than sit around an scratch my head
Make out with the living dead
I'm breakin' bottles
Breakin' fences
Breakin' everything
I said
I'll break a bet, break a bet, i'll break a bet, i'll break a bet
I'll say!
Oh yeah
C'mon back down one more time
Hey stoopid step inside
Hey stoopid come on and join the ride
Hey stoopid step inside
I said come along baby feel the rush inside
Hey stoopid
Hey stoopid
Hey stoopid</pre>
