[Cee-Lo]
I've seen it with my own eyes
How we're gettin otherwise without the luxury of leavin (leavin)
The touch and feeling of free is untangible technically
Something you've got to believe in ('lieve in)
Connect the cause and effect, one foot in front of the next
This is the start of a journey (journey)
And my mind is already gone, and though there are other unknowns
Somehow this doesn't concern me ('cern me)
And you can stand right there if you want

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
But I'm going on... and I'm prepared to go it alone~!
I'm going on... to a place in the sun that's nice and warm
I'm going on, and I'm sure they'll have a place for you too
Oo-hoo-ooh

[Cee-Lo]
Anyone that needs what they want, and doesn't want what they need
I want nothing to do with (do with)
I am to do what I want, and to do what I please
Is first off my to-do list (to-do list)
But every once in a while, I think about her smile
One of the few things I do miss (do miss)
But baby I've got to go, baby I've got to know
Baby I've got to prove it (prove it)
And I'll see you when you get there

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
But I'm going on... and I'm prepared to go it alone~!
I'm going on... may my love lift you up to the place you belong
I'm going on, and I promise I'll be waiting for you
Oo-hoo-ooh
