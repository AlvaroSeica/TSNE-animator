Hey!

[Intro: repeat 4X]
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know

[Verse 1]
Shawty Lo -- I got flavor
Cause you know, the kid got paper
Like 40, don't "Save Her"
Bankhead - been pullin capers!
The way you drop woulda thought I had a taser
Call me street, like the razor
Shawty Lo, A-T-L, I'm the MAYOR
Street nigga but my gear be tailored
Every now and then, Shawty might rock gators
Me and that kush, I got acres
Yeahhhhhhh! No more nosey-ass neighbors
Big up -- to all my haters!

[Chorus]
L-O, L-O, dey know, dey know {*repeat 3X*}
Got a message to ponder you get get get it!

(Shawty L-O man... hey, hey!)

[Verse 2]
I'm the man -- and I know that
I got cash -- I'm talkin throwback
A hundred grand -- what's that?
I hit the club -- and I blow that
All these hoes, know Lo that
I'm picture perfect, made for Kodak
Let's talk money, I got plenty
DOPE BOYZ LET'S GET GET GET IT!!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3]
Hey-hey-hey, hey how you doin it's L-O
Seven seat three, I'm the one in the middle
And I don't need this beat, I can rock it acapello
No one but two, all I needed was a Skittle
And yeahhhh, now I'm geeked
Screamin YESSIR, just like Jeez'
A-Town fitted, who but me?
L-O, she know, he know, they know
I am (I am)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
They know (they know) they know (they know)
They know (they know) they know (they know)
They know (they know) they know (they know)</pre>
