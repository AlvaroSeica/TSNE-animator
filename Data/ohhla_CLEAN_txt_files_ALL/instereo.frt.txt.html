(That beat is hard)

[Mike Shinoda]
This is how it goes
Welcome one and all to the show
We're wired up
Fired up
Fucking ready to go
In the back of the parking lot outside of the bar
Twenty deep
Twenty feet from the boulevard
Black hoodies
Black caps
Black label in glasses
Previewing the new shit before the masses
Cause the first thing I need when I've got a new beat
Is to see how it sounds
Echoing off the street
I just take it for a spin
Pop the CD in
Slide it up to ten and get that rearview shaking
Then play it again so there's no mistaking
San Andreas the block
Get this bitch earthquaking live

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
Oh
Ready for it here we go
We got the whole block rocking in stereo
We're taking control
Letting everybody know
And if you feel it
Let me hear everybody go
Ohhh...

[Mike Shinoda]
You're not ready
I got plenty cuts for twenty months dropped steadily
Plenty tracks to empty on your wack pedigree
I'm backed heavily while you're backpeddling
Forget the chitchat on me homie
Kick back
I'm on that shit that can get your homie bitch-slapped
So zip your lip back
Listen and watch
We got the whole block rockin' off the way the beat knocks
You don't have to warn the people on the corner
They know
That if you're standing on that corner then you're getting that show
World premiering you're hearing that Machine Shop flow
San Andreas the block
Get this bitch earthquaking like

[Hook]

[Bridge - Mike Shinoda]
Turn the key
Turn the volume up to loud
Roll right
Roll every window down
Let the whole block know what this is about
Turn it up y'all
Burn that system out

[Hook - 2x]</pre>
