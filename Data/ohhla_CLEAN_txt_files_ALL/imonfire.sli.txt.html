Song:   I'm On Fire
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire, I'm on fire

Tell me now baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I'd do
I can take you higher, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like
Someone took a knife
Baby edgy and dull
And cut a 6 inch valley
Through the middle of my soul

And I don't wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire, hmm I'm on fire
Hmmm I'm on fire
Hmmm I'm on fire</pre>
