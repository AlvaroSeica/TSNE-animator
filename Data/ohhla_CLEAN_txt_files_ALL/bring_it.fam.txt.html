Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Lounge Lo]
Bring it on (hot in the cold, selling your soul)
Bring it on (it's all about the riches and gold)
Bring it on (and fuck all them bitches that told)
And the snitches on the block who got my niggas in holes

[Shawn Wigs]
Longevity, ratchet filled with slugs and the pedigree
Murder one, squeeze it off, and shoot an enemy
See me in the Pearl J, thirty at the crab fest
Baggin' a skama, tucked in my Avirex
Index finger's like ice trays, bring it if you want
Get caught in a haze of blunt smoke
And ashes, push ya E-classes and Benz wagons
Thug passion, head til she gagging
Checkered red flag and I'm ready to rock
Got slugs in the sock and doolas in the block

[Lounge Lo]
I got it by a long shot, it's two in the range, bringing the pain
Pump-paow, jump crowds like Meth from Wu-Tang
Muthafuckas wanna speak on they game, same shit
Same click, who wanna speak on my name, screamin' in vein
Twin guns, spit one, rip, one in the frame
For the cat who tried to short us on 'caine, ride in ya lane
Survival of the fittest, full throttle ya brain
It's the automatic disorder from my dangerous slang
Slant spit, hang with, Othorized/Tang shit
Yo, it's thugs from Shaolin, plus bloods and crips
But is you with me? I represent my city and my borough
The niggas in the Hill, for real, we stay thorough
And Mash it Out like M.O.P., what's my name, like
Jigga Jay-Z, start wars from day three
But it's Othorized, big suprise, the nice ones
Black and white ones, who roll with nice guns

[Chorus: Lounge Lo]
Bring it on (hot in the cold, selling your soul)
Bring it on (it's all about the riches and gold)
Bring it on (and fuck all them bitches that told)
And the snitches on the block who got my niggas in holes
Bring it on (we gotta have cash and whips)
Bring it on (in exactly, and big ass tips)
Bring it on (fuck all them bitches that told)
And the snitches on the block who got my niggas in holes

[Crunch Lo]
Ox is in the mouth, rathet out the belt, hot box felt
Make ya skin melt, nigga, we bad for ya health
Hazardous, cause I mastered this, loving the flip
Deep like the Book of Lazazus, holding the grip
In the cut, electrified like a bone of dust
Stainless steel gats, don't rust, they just bust
So whatever, if you think you really know the weather
Sleep with the fish and your fam'll bloody leather
Heartless manuevers, train niggas like I'm Lou Dooba
I don't show you love, you ain't my doola
Loser, everytime you test for mine
Keep stepping up my game when you shit on my name
Same Hussein, nothing but pounds, to gain to eat
Sittin' like Size/7 and Street, running with heat
In these dirty streets, dirty purty birds, clucking they beak
Try'nna rock me, monkey wrench try'nna stop me
Spaz like a stiff neck, in love with the big tech
Dramatize bones, from sharms, clogging my net

[Molly-Q]
Bring it on, apron eights under each arm
Running ammo, he on, homicide in each palm
The family class, heat seeker in the dash
Came rolling down the block, side talking all the trash
Clash of the titans, Johnny Mack, stick and move
The Rainbow Coalition got nothing to lose
We got tattoos, gun wounds, baloon with refumes
Tie you in your room up, in your living room
The hood Frank Sinatra, Godfather, Don Dada
Glad to save, collect harm and take kid, the Globetrotter
We thug around the map, it's like that, the big mouth
Pimp pole tree, take you down the wrong route
