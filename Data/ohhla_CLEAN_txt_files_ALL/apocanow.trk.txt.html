[Intro: Truck]
Cheah, he's back on my tail
Yo, why this nigga keep followin me man?
Why this nigga keep followin me, yo, yo

[Chorus 2X: Apocalipps]
The time is now, it's a new day
Fuck what you say, we gon do it our way
Truck is here, we ain't got time to play
Apocalypse now, this whole shit can end today

[Truck]
Yo I was destined to come, this industry need me
I'm a Staten Island boy, so don't confuse me
When ??? and killer ain't thoro
This one is for the fairy boat crashin, New York's fifth borough
Yeah it's cold outside, temperature below zero
Dude got shot cuz he tried to be a hero
His man's yelling, his girl's ready to snitch
Twenty five years to life, man I ain't dyin a bitch
Believe me God, things don changed
I guess the days and times will never stay the same
How'd we reelect the president that's killing our people?
It's 2005 and we still ain't equal
Welfare cut off, bullets sky high
Can't find a job for shit no matter how hard we try
And there's one thing that I don't understand
How is there one jail in this world and less programs?
And every dime that we get gotta go to Uncle Sam, damn

[Chorus 2X]

[Truck]
You better talk to your family, go warn your friends
You don't gotta read the Bible to know shit's gonna end
The days is short, the nights is colder
The devil put poisen in your fifty cent sodas
Armaggeddon, fishes show up dead in the water
Mexicans have it so bad they have to run for the border
Spending millions of dollars to be here for war
But AIDS is killing millions, so where is the cure?
Where's shelter for the homeless or food for the poor?
That's why we forced to rab man, to slang the raw
Three deez hop out, try to wild on us
But they really ain't shit without the badge and cuffs
Man that's all I can stand, yeah, I had enough
There's too much pollution in the air, destroying the seasons
Kids rebel against their parents for no fucking reason
Why you disrespectful? Who you pleasing?
I'm just a savage cat
And if you feeling me, bust a shot in the air like fuck if I ??? that
Where your cabbage at? You rollin? Nigga grab your gat
You don't got that, grab a knife or a bat
Grab a stick, sharpen it, nigga, stab him with that
C4 the pancake mix, blow him away with that, blao</pre>
