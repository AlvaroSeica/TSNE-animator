[Intro]
Ladies and Gentlemen in the Southern states of America
We gather here today and bring you the beginning of the new era
And now the speaker of the South, J. Prince

[J. Prince - talking]
Awww yeah.. Rap-A-Lot back in the house once again
With the trillest of the trill, Bun B
The new president of the South
Yo Bun, it's your time
And we dedicate this one to all our brothers and sisters
Who suffered at the hands of the industry

[Bun B]
It's been a long time comin' but it finally came
For Bun B to get his motherfuckin' shot in the game
I put my work in than an average trill nigga can put
And I'ma gangsta from my head to my foot
Black understood, I got the hood behind me
The street's co-signed me
Head ported in the ghetto, you know where to find me
The mission is laid out and the vision is clear
From this moment I run the South and everything down here
From the corners and cuts, trap spots and blocks
Whether it's rappin' or work, I got the shit on lock
I ain't wit' all that back talkin', sneak dissin', or plexin'
I'ma tell ya how I feel 'cause I'ma god damn Texan
'Bout time for me to start eliminatin' the fraud
'Cause this a White House of cars, filled wit' nuttin but broads
We gon' run them hoes out and put some trill niggaz in
'Cause what happened in New Orleans, should never happen again
They been sittin' on they ass, doin' much about nuttin
For too god damn long, and I'm tired of the frontin'
I'ma instigate a change from the motherfuckin' top
'Cause this bullshit they pullin' on my people gotta stop
So I'm here to make a stand (stand) and take up the slack
Dirty South, Prince, Deezy I got ya motherfuckin' back
It's a new king on the throne, and its crown is a hat
It say "Free Pimp C," now what's fuckin' wit' that?
Hail to the chief {*echoes*}</pre>
