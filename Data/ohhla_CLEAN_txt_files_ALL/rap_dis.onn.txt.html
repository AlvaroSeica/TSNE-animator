[DJ Swiss]

Wanna test s-o that's a NO
I'm a DJ but I heat up Mic's wen I flow!
Spit for real
Hit to kill
It gets messy when I grip my steel

[Scat-D]

Explosive flows like my rapture
Distinctive part on my counter
Faster them get pure gonâ capture
Dropping you like a tonne a bricks
You sonâ a bitch..

[DJ Swiss]

Iâm dustinâ
You can catch bullets when the gats are bustinâ
Outside Niggaz don't really trust them
South side niggaz gettin pissed with lust then
So what's the fuss then?

[Scat-D]

The way Iâm hittin ya
2002 Scat-D come through
Faster then the 88 year from the livia
so illia its true no fakin
Chicks in my sight and Iâm takinâ
Straight up and Iâm still rakinâ
Chicks wanna talk bout baby-making (huh)
I'm not into that, fuck that, ladiez keep a kitty-kat

[DJ Swiss]

Hot shit I'm gonna drop shit
S-o-S...So Solid can't stop dis
Flop this
Playa haterz wanna knock this
Stop this
Then niggaz canât stop this
Ive got just another person on my hitlist
So you dismiss, No witness
No business, 'cause I Swiss this
If you knew what I thought you would shit bricks
I got big hits
I've got dough
I didn't even really need to rip dis
But the flows are addictive
Are you feelin tha vibe that I give dis?

[chorus]

You cant stop dis shit you know
We got chicks, ice, platinum whips &amp; 2 much dough (?)
If u wanna try and have a go
Theres 25 of us each loaded with a gat
Hey yo new kaish i got a ya back!

[Neutrino]

Stuck in...
People from school data fink they're eight-even!
What's the funniest thing I've seen?
Too explicit so buy the CD
It's censored, cus it's too cold!
Too cold- S-Club 5...
"Don't stop moving'"
I stop every time I 'ear your music.
How the fuck you get caught like data?
Cannabis, more like smoking crack!
I'm sick these fake MC's, sounding' like Mr Blobby
Ski-bi-di-bi-di-bi-di
Wot da fuck you on, LSD?
Everything is bigger difference
Find out the price, get vexed
And then your wifey's, up at da T.V.
Wantin' Neuchy, Creamin' her panties-
And wen u diggin her in bed, she picturin me!
I dare ya this ma bout gettin gettin' jacked
Or I'll break in your house, when I'm dressed in black, and I pull out ma gat!
Strip ya naked, take your possesions,
Now thats gettin' jacked, JACKED?
I shot myself in the leg, cuz I'm fucking crazy like dat! (Crazy like dat...)

[DJ Swiss]

Everyâ¦time I make ma dough
Then I make ma dough
Ya canât hit ma dough ya know
Iâm gonna make sure I let you know that when I spit my flow
Its for my hits that blow ya know
Iâm gonna make you know that when we lock down shit
Its long time, its oxide ya know
So when you hear this you feel this,
This the real shit
Itâs time ya know

[Harvey]

So Solid gonna wreck this
Wanna rap when im out and I bust this
To the Ph who wanna test dis
Up hose get blows when I do this
Nowâ¦..
The mad stress that gets in my brain
Its never the same
1 2
I always take them to the game game
The mad things that I do for this
Forget the crisp
Now you know why livin my life is a crisp
I know we got nice things, and we got nice things
Now I know why you really wanna hate man
I know we got man, I see my gat man, nice, but still
I donât give a damn man
Iâm gonna state all my pâs and qâs
And ma 1âs and 2âs
Just to get to the cruise bruise
Iâm a hit you with my lyrical chat
Raise the Gat
So SOLID Crew lock that
Iâm gonna hit you with my lyrical flow
Donât you know when Iâm on the mike
making my dough ya know
Iâm gonna hit you with my lyrical vibe
Watch the rhyme, so solid crew oxide
Iâm gonna hit you with my lyrical flow
Donât you know when Iâm on the mike
making my dough ya know
Iâm gonna hit you with my lyrical vibe
Watch the rhyme, so solid crew oxide

[Chorus]

[Scat-D]

Tell me somethin'
When your rollin; and your ice and your whips
and your trips and your pics and your team
You gotta a lot of talk when you donât walk that way
I heard you guys callin but I donât see ya play
Tell me somethinâ
When your rollin; with ice and your whips
and your trips and your pics and your team
You gotta a lot of talk when you donât walk that way
I heard you guys callin but I donât see ya play
Through the years you been livin it up
Your back but your filling it up, living it up
Itâs time for my giving up, no way, no way
So Solid made haters pray
Pushed up before then we tumbled down the hill
Runaway...no way...runaway...no way</pre>
