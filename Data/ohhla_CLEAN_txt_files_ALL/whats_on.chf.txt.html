Typed by: Cno Evil

"What the hell is going on?"
"Hey, what's going on?"

[Intro: Popa Chief]
I'll fucking tell you what's going on
You just copped some Burnt Biskut Productz
If you hearing the sound of my voice
In your audio... that's good.. showing love to me
I gots to show love back to you
Word up, I love all of ya'll
My South Jersey ass
I got a rigorous schedule, a lot of tapes and CDs to peddle
Nicks and dimes to juggle, cash out in bubble
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble

[Popa Chief]
I got a rigorous schedule, a lot of tapes and CDs to peddle
Nicks and dimes to juggle, cash out in bubbles
Anti up for the struggle, you know it's gon' be some trouble
If you see my fam, huddle, don't get left, stuck and leaking in the red puddle
My game is tighter than two fat chicks in the same girdle
All my niggas break jaws, slang and hustle
Clap and grapple, cuz the pigs love the apple
Alize gat, with the lemon tea Snapple
Me, myself, and I, we gang tackle (get 'em)
When I blow up, though, comes shackle
I told ya'll I get at you
If I ain't serial killing the track, I'm
Probably getting thrown out of clubs, cuz I don't know how to act
It's the bounce man, I can get you back
Stay right there, muthafucka I'll be right back
Relocate, look on helpelsy as I politate
But I don't break, South Jersey heavyweight
Live and direct from the weed gate, come on

[Hook: Popa Chief]
Puff puff, yea, puff puff, yea
Puff puff, yea, puff puff, yea
Puff puff, yea, puff puff, yea
Puff, yea

[Popa Chief]
2002 raps, any raps come on attack
With Mortal Kombat type slang, that, keeps the joint packed
Ain't no mishaps, Popa Chief with the put backs
And I better see some kick back
The verbal terrorist is back, plus with my musical mack
Cops is caking raps, nigga put my strays back
I trump lights out, with suscribed bloody murder
Tweety screaming horror, like it ain't no tomorrow
As I bang your eardrums like war drums, homicidal percussions
Plus I said, leave your body numb, come on
This is called a hat trick, I'm towards a double lick cactus
Popa Chief know his way around a mattress
Top rank, so funky, got stank
Reefer reeking, all the way to the bank, I'll
Be that nigga who put the square peg in the brown hole
Stone cold, I got the itchy trigger to choke hold
Yea... get high with Mary Watson, bush free up
Broke the mold... iceberg cold

[Chorus 2X: Popa Chief]
This that shit, that sparks your interest, by my entrance
Verbal type, say something fierce, ya'll
Need some of ya'll to beg, don't need to beg
Why ya'll need my pleasure to break these walls

[Outro: Popa Chief]
Burnt Biskut Productz why that nigga put the rented bitch near the wall
South Jersey's finest, Burnt Biskut Product
Production, reppin' your... South Jersey tellin' you
Put it in your ear hole, Burnt Biskut Productz
Get 'em, got 'em, good</pre>
