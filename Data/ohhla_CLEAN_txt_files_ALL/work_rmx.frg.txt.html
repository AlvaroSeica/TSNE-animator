[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
I gotta close the window before I record
Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
Stand up

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Coogi down to the socks like I'm Biggie poppa
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho
Cause you know the Fergenstein getting plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shining in the Benzo
Ballin', skkkkrrrrrrrr
Got me feelin' like Jim Jones
I'm a pimp though, no limp though
Couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the buildin', semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they getting on my nerves
I ain't lyin', lyin' lay 'em on the curb
Riding on a killer who be coming at Ferg!
Damnnnnnnnn!!!
Girl you twerk, twerk that kitty girl make it purr
Put in work, flacko put 'em in the dirt
Frech got the shovel he gon' put him in the earth
Trinidad maniac with a all gold hearse
Yeah, uh, put in work
Schoolboy Q with a pound of the purp
So much work he'll smoke up the earth
Polo Ground, A$AP World

[Verse 2: French Montana]
That aint Kanye
That's Montana, loose cannon
He shot me so I had to do it
Put him in the dirt, put him in there first
I just sold a swammy with a ten homies on it
Her ass fat, you can park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, they comin for your ice
When they band faces, they comin' for your life
Baby don't pray for me pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean it help me sleep
Illuminati I'm from the streets
Never saw my body, we taking bodies
Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
Shout out that mother land, twelve years old with guns in hand
They don't ask no questions, nigga, all they do is bang bang bang
They don't ask no questions, all they do is bang bang
I said I do this for them shottas, Trinidad I love ya
I do this for them shottas, Jamaica I'm your brother
I know a bitch from .., yeah yeah yeah that's my partner
You got a problem with it, then that's your problem
I fuck with Asian niggaz And I fuck with migos
I fuck with Haitian niggaz, all they speak is creole
I said all I speak is real, y'all niggaz might hate me
But that don't get no deal, I said no that don't get no deal
I just now got my deal, but I been gettin' this money
No green card in this struggle, immigration give you nothin'
But work (Put it in work)
Work (Put it in work)
Work (Put it in work)

[Verse 4: Schoolboy Q]
A lotta niggaz died, should've been from Hoover Street
No I do not have a car, but I could buy one every week
Pimpin like I'm thirty three, move keys like I'm thirty six
Cheek bones like I'm 28, Tocamono know I'm pushin' weight
O-X-Y I'm in your state, eatin' off your dinner plate
My heart live with sanisty, super fly, I need a cape
Bitches throwin' pussy back and forth, they on my dick
Passion drippin' off her lip, she say she never had a crip
Uh, put it in work, all big booties make ya twerk
All big titties lift your shirt, show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put it in work, spray his ass in front of Church
Deacon said I did my shit, the pastor said, "That nigga turnt"
Pop my collar on my shirt, make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units, Captain Kirk, takin' xannies poppin' purps
Might not last, I'll bomb it first, turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth, had to give Young Ferg a verse

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
A lot of homies try and do the crime, homicide
Joggin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Out of line, pistols barkin' "Ar, ar" ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that Pretty Flacko? Ratchets, designer jackets
The same niggaz who jack it be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress, side bitch won a beauty pagent
Got a chick that worked at Magic, but I'm so damn fine make a bitch look average
Do my .. in heaven, right next to Ferg
You know what's up I'm throwin' bucks, Loaded Lux
Put in work</pre>
