Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My enemies know its on
My homies know that its on
I'm on tour, my hoes miss me
They want me to come home
Yea they know, I came from the bottom
It shows I came from the bottom
I'm fantasizing about having babies, with Snow Tha Product
Bitches know that this is my prime, got my soldiers on the sideline
Sucios my religion bitch, I don't need a co-sign
I fuck with [?] Bito the ratchet hoes
Fuck [?]
Got em, fucken em, and suckin em
And I don't even know magic
My life is full of that drama, I didn't vote for Obama
They deported some of my soldiers, now we gotta go to Tijuana

[Chorus]
Gerardo Ortiz..that Roberto Tapia
I bump my music with the sound
And that estilo de mafia
(estilo de mafia)
(estilo de mafia)
Cocaine, bad bitches
(estilo de mafia)
Got the musicos playing
(estilo de mafia)
Drug money imported
(estilo de mafia)

They grow that shit in Mexico..
They got that shit from Mexico..
The plug's up in Mexico..
They learned that shit from Mexico..

Thank god for the color blue, thank god for my whole crew
Thank god to these bad bitches who fuck with us
&amp; don't fuck with you, pulled up and they talk about it
9mm gun automatic, I let em know
I'm Mexican, motherfucker I'm proud about it
Allergic to these wannabes, mob life who wants beef?
Put holes all in your body, make you look like a bag of them Funyun rings
Tell your whole family, tell your big cousin
Write a letter to your homeboys that been busted

[Chorus]
Gerardo Ortiz..that Roberto Tapia
I bump my music with the sound
And that estilo de mafia
(estilo de mafia)
(estilo de mafia)
Cocaine, bad bitches
(estilo de mafia)
Got the musicos playing
(estilo de mafia)
Drug money imported
(estilo de mafia)</pre>
