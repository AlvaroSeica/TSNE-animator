[Intro: Dom Pachino]
I think I've been punished...
They don't wanna expose me to the public...

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, I beg you not to challenge me, I think violenty
Hang ya ass like canape cloths, you can't cancel me off
Know my faculty, react rapidly
Stacking CREAM, like a linebacker from the Green Bay Packers, be
While persuing my dream, like a starving actor
Whose been waiting for the silver screen
Golden rules, street smarts, always get you through
Got crazy with the boys, got kicked out of school
Get a Benz, said "fuck it", got my GED to
Came out, never used it, it was something to do
Bang door, the lunch on table, kicking lyrics after school
Same kids that was there, they be blasting at you...

[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino]
We all criminals too, different views
Just a message, to subliminal you</pre>
