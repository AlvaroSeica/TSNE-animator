Song:   Lisa, Where Have You Been?
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: sounds like The Super 3 are at a laundromat]
Huh? Say what? (I will in December)
Hehe (December - my final, Christmas gift of life)
{*LAUGHING*} Christmas gift of life!!
{*loud noises, clothes going in a basket perhaps*}
Just, of course (don't say nothin stupid)
(I got her towels in my dryer)

[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
Lisa where have you been?
Nowhere around
Now you are back
I found my smile again because of you

[Chorus]
I'm leaving the world, just you and I
I give it to you to show me the light
I'm leaving the world, just you and I
I give it to you to show me the light

[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
I know that I've changed
It's just that my mind has been arranged, been arranged
I am the same, but I'm blinded by the pain
Don't leave again, again

[Chorus]</pre>
