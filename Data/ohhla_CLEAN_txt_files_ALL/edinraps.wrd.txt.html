Listen up this is Scottish rap (Whats that)
Right there cunt top of the map (Just chavs)
In the UK we live shitty (Its all shit)
No getting paid in Edinburgh City [X2]

Its Deeko Wardie Madhat Riddlah
Chazel Dandy Blastfimous Sinna
Dave Gunn Kontempt Matchstick men
Simba Bluhnt and Jee4ce ken
This is Edinburgh Cunt just to name a few
Who know we could blow like we go at-cho
Scottish hip hop its just started coming
So now we all here all the old guys running
Think I'm touching a nerve there
But honestly I aint got to say anymore there
I cya later my paper is getting heard brer
So tell all the haters that waiters can only serve Werd
Im not paid but I'm giving you tips
Its like you just got better because you listened to this
And if your not Scottish this is not a diss
Its just we the shit I'm not taking the piss

Rap is dementing whats with the tension
Yes I'm class so I teach them a lesson
No money so guess that you ken then
I just do it in vain like Mark Renton
I'm not spending no I am skint
But I got an idea put it all in the ink
People dont want to hear what I think
I put you on ice like you do on a rink
Unsigned so they dont sell me
In a pure 'Rage' I wont do what you tell me
Your sick he's sick he telt you
I'm no sick no mate I'm healthy
See I rock like hard candy
And my jaw pops like I just copped Mandy
I can (can) kick like you cant
Still trying to sell in the shops that am banned from

You say thats a weak track I dont need that
I'm my own critic I rip it so fuck feedback
Is what you say going to change how I do this
No it aint so shut it and make music
I love rap a fact just ask cupid
Love at first mic so I write and I use it
I'm with Deeko my people the troops in
Never walk alone like at home when the hoops sing
So if you helped al be paying you back
And if you didnÂ’t little cunt you just sit at the back
See we bust raps bus that sit at the back
On the twenty six to Porty with the buckie on my lap
Give me chucky on the hash gone give me a tap
I'll pay you back if your lucky because I'm fucked with the cash
See I'm dirty pretty mucky and I started from scratch
So by the time am thirty buddy you be lucky with half
