Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Say something true
Behind every man is a woman
Behind now I do it for attention
If I ain't guess do it all the time is
True, these other women false but you
True, we can kick it as long as you keep it
True, I'm down to take it down with you
True, forget the consequences

When this ride through she got me open nice
Know how to work the mike, plus she ride too
She make me that crap... never fight fuse
Plus she ride the red bottles like she die move
Don't like the model when she stylin' on..
All these other niggas swear they got it what she my boo
She a stew with this so she fly too
She got cake too, all the ay vibe coop

[Chorus]
Say something true
Behind every man is a woman
Behind now I do it for attention
If I ain't guess do it all the time is
True, these other women false but you
True, we can kick it as long as you keep it
True, I'm down to take it down with you
True, forget the consequences

Yeah, alleviate without a stressing
The baddest bitch I swear they add like a Twitter mention
Other niggas beginners, she barely seen that bentley
She barely sillin missing 'cause she missin at me pimpin
Smoking this weed my deepest shawty sweet Mississippi
I hear the beat I better seem, like you sing in the symphony
I blowin rather just me and now I'm add us
Don't worry when I cut this feelings, just know I have em
Just know is real, just know is real
Some type of hundred is really nothing I'm blowin heels
Make a candy ring shawty so for real
Sees everywhere, hell yeah soldier feel
Bring out the sun girl, you the one girl
You do the thing girl, you should be my main girl
That's

[Chorus]
True, these other women false but you
True, we can kick it as long as you keep it
True, I'm down to take it down with you
True, forget the consequences

I call the party and she got me spending time
She got me chasing seconds
And she don't even give a five but time is the message
I'm only chop it off before we connecting
Body like our now glass sweetest then took connected
Each side my rock, Louie hin back nothing less
Or every day she do for me don't even let her now or bad
Every day she move for me don't even let her now our past
Take my time and massage in the shower
Say I got the power 'cause I never need the power that long
Yeah swear in our back 'cause you can't get in our back
Physical that she spend the nights in bollies
We take long nights trial just to spite the mollage
And at the high school she wanna ride the college
Make it give me good brain just to spite the knowledge
So he thousand V up just to spite the poli
I would never trap up but I'm a keep her, yeah

[Chorus]
Say something true
Behind every man is a woman
Behind now I do it for attention
If I ain't guess do it all the time is
True, these other women false but you
True, we can kick it as long as you keep it
True, I'm down to take it down with you
True, forget the consequences</pre>
