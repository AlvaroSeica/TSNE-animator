Song:   Lean
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus x2: Styles P &amp; Fiend]
Lean in the whip, Lean in the cup
Lean off a blunt, Lean on a butt
I lean on these bitch niggas with' a gun
I lean on my money cus I stacked it up

[Styles P]
I'm on the lean off of ramulin and earwax
Mad high getting stuck on fairfax
Now let me hit you with the clear facts
Got a bunch of sons but I didn't go bareback
Ghost Bars, Dead verses, to get a nigga high is the meds purpose
To bring a nigga down is the feds purpose
Like my insides white, but let me get a red surface
White walls, caddy flow
That boy so G that even ya mom and daddy know
Ghost be getting high on the patio
Hit you with the [?] tho right where you tatted tho
I'm buggin out, nah you buggin out
Them niggas on the lean so they went and pulled the bubbie out
It's a lot of blue shit and it's real bloody out
And it's real pretty but I bet it get real ugly out, yeah

[Chorus: x2]
Lean in the whip, Lean in the cup
Lean off a blunt, Lean on a butt
I lean on these bitch niggas with' a gun
I lean on my money cus I stacked it up

[Curren$y]
Right when fools thought I was all music
Leaned on them flexed green on em and pinky ring on em
Never seen garments, Iceberg knits got Bart Simpson on em
Luxury sedans under car covers interior gravy, softer than butter
I got that from hard work, I got more coming
My fly, My style got your woman
My nigga Corner Boy P keep his cup muddy
I don't drink but I keep it in my fridge for him
Me I'm Champagne pouring
Pedal to the floor in something foreign vertical lifting door
Woke up this morning, and came up with a way
To settle the score on these ol' ho ass niggas
Run up the store, roll up the smoke stand on the throat on these ol' ho ass niggas
I be so mad with em, but I ain't stressing I'm chillin
Living off the land, leaning like a kick stand, yeah

[Chorus: x4]
Lean in the whip, Lean in the cup
Lean off a blunt, Lean on a butt
I lean on these bitch niggas with' a gun
I lean on my money cus I stacked it up</pre>
