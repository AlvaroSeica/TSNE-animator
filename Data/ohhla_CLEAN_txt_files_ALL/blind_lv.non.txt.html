hey... you remember...euh...when...euh
your were just a little kid in the summer
and the days are getting hot
and school was like ending
and this girl that you thought
was cute was like banning your brain
making your will say
try to figure out
how to ask her out
see what love 's all about
But yo...
You couldn't do it cuz you boy with this
So you like hot coffee and a oh sweet kiss
Spent the whole entire summer kicking yourself in the ass
Promises that you will never let the same thing pass
Twice...
Self promising are the hardest to keep
when the self conjunct list start to creep
butterflies op in his stomach
when it's time to speak
and even say a word and nothing like feel weak
and the beating at the game of love was so a loser
when you chose her but she is not having it
So I'm like rapping away my pain
try to find a piece of mind
try to site this love game
She said: oh our love is so, and I'm never gonna let you go...

[chorus] (2x)
This time I got to get this girl out of my mind
I'm love six
It's try to report my sunshine
I wish that I just be back and be blind
but love's make me blind, it's make my blind

during the summer I spend my time to press
my friends try to get saddest of of my chest
they say: she look good, but she ain't fresh
body maybe nice but her brain is a mess
Listen, she look good but she ain't all that
for behind is fat but her mind is weak
Yo, I understood that for love is even worse
When you got friends who joke and laugh 'til they burst
so up tune the burse with a switch and a hop witch voice
hoping I'm making the right choice
Voice my mind by like: yo, I want you
girls never care about me: you want who??
Forget it...
I just having myself collect my wealth
than we content to stay by myself
because follow this love game has be like going in circles
my big red hart is now purple
She said: oh our love is so, and I'm never gonna let you go...

[chorus] (2x)
This time I got to get this girl out of my mind
I'm love six
It's try to report my sunshine
I wish that I just be back and be blind
but love's make me blind, it's make my blind

Yo I'm blind and I'm blind , blind, blind, blind(2x)
and I can not see in front of me...


Yo I'm blind and I'm blind , blind, blind, blind
Love six
yes I'm blind and I'm blind , blind, blind
love six
I can't see in front of me cuz she is like of my beau...</pre>
