Verse 1 (Abel)

Peep this 5'6'' nigga with more game than Starter
Been pimping these hoes since I was shooting dog water
Call me plastic man cause I pack that plastic glock
Slinging my rocks on my block to the sunrise to the sun drop
I'm bout it than done some shit that God couldn't forgive
Ever since I was that coke baby with two weeks to live
Shit my life is complex think I got a voodoo hex
Busters try to wet me, bitches step get shot up like Malcolm X
You fucking motherfuckers got his pocket full of boulders
You sick of being sober hit me on my motorola
Drink Cavassi A straight out the bottle counting g's
Why you counting on the lotto
Fuck ya'll is my motto
Hit the streets make my ends rocks hidden in my M &amp; M's
Bitch this ain't Whodini, ain't no motherfucking friends
Niggas average while caine be deadly like miscarriage
And if it come to it I'm gone put one in your cabbage
I'd rather steal to get paid like Shaquille O'Neal
Soon as I drop my draws all of ya'll old ladies gone kneel
Getting deep getting funky like some rock star coochie
I'm jigging player haters just like pace makers for my loochie
Partner my name is Kane got more game than the dope game
Know less than 16 for every bird that I slang

(Chorus)

My mama wish she had a fucking abortion
Cause I done so much shit so much gangsta shit
&gt;From every crime from drugs to extortion
I know my mama wish she had a fucking abortion

Verse 2 (Kane)

I roll with No Limit cut throats trying to stack C-Notes
Wearing green and white Nauticas and Mecca polos
It all started my cousin got 'em got some heroin from Puerto Rico
We call it ?? and snorted by alot of people
Going to the place where danger awaits me
I never knew my moms but if I did she probably hate me
&gt;From small time hustling to sticking up dope spots
My grandma found a 100 grand stashed in a shoebox
She kicked me out sent me down south where they be balling
Got a 100 got 200 on a trip to New Orleans
They used to love that weed like its they only child
Now they got the naza cocaine it got 'em wild
This child was born a twin seven minutes from my brother
No visions of my dad wouldn't recognize my mother
And now I'm so obsessed with this money I be earning
I'm sicker than the fucking Germans
All I see is green like Erick Sermon

(Chorus)</pre>
