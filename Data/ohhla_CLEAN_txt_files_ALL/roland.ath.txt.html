"Railroad my soul to a hellhole"

[Atherton]
Call me a puppy here on the side of my bed
With lots of love for the fear you despise in your head
It's kind of bugged but it's clear that mine is the dread
I wouldn't take the time to memorize the lines that YOU said...
So say somethin desperate
Like these days you talk to razor blades like a best friend
And beat breaks been replaced with headbangin on your dresser
And dreamstates in which you die are some of the best ever
Tears for Fears, let's measure out an ounce
Shotglass down the hatch, let me taste it...
I drink your eyes, it stinks insides
'til the summit of my stomach feels vacant
We, cling to things in our dangerous minds
Rotten thoughts that you got let me take 'em
Needle to the vein, +I+ need your pain
Our euphoria, gloriously wasted

{*scratched*}
"It was inside that I cried"

[Patience]
Blood curdling sharp air, that brisk taste dominates
California dreamin is the only way I operate
Through the winters who play injuries and contemplate
The lost brigade, they sought today, to tolerate, it's not okay
It ain't alright, I came to fight the flight or cut your throat
Extend to venomous women that die diminishin love and hope
It's one below what I hoped it was
And now I can't stand back, bite my tongue and not hold a grudge
The soul of us, daybreak I feel defeated
Beat the night, illumin' my sight, but seein the fuckin weakness
And that's the last thing you wanna view before sleep
And every one of you can hold me down and drown in codeine
I feel the cold fiendish way to make my heartbeat
A panoramic scene that sees the evil creeps that haunts me
Leak universe, freeze blood hothead
Patience with the microphone, made it out not dead</pre>
