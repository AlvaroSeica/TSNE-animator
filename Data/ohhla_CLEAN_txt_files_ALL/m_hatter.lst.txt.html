[Intro: G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
What's up, yo, it's the Gods
Not the true and living, Five Percent Gods
Real, actual... Gods, in the house
And it's about time we let ya'll triflin' ass niggas know
We running out of patience with you, get it together
Right now!

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
You asking me? If this the, end of time?
Go ask a human being and you still won't know
You're like asking a man's penis where a dildo go
Your shit be boring, and let's face it you can't think straight
Your like a rat in a maze and I be the cheese maker
Great architecht and you be the great faker
Look around your planet and contemplate your fall
Mansion world nigga, watch me bounce you down the hall
You see there's so many ways to slay you, you making it easy
Let's start with them cheesy ass beats
And all that temporal nonsense full of non sequitors and incompletes
Your shit cold garbage nigga, get a motherfuckin' clue
You see there's two basic methods to approach in ruining you
One, make like Puffy and overtly advertize you
Two, make like Kool Keith and Ultramagnetize you
I float like a Killa Bee, you bounce like a bumble
I made all the thugs cry when I closed down the Tunnel

[Chorus 2X: G-Clef Da Mad Komposa, Archangel Metatron]
Trife niggas, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
I crush your stupid dreams and eat up all your pasta
Cuz you trife, a waste of life, dead matter
Your pockets may be fatter, but I'm the mad hatter

[Archangel Metatron]
New York nigga, now it's time to switch the flow
Ya'll rap's trash, who's dick, you blow?
Was it Mr. A&amp;R, did he say you'd get hoes and cars?
Your dreams so fucking retarded, there's more than rap and b-balling
Why can't you be a doctor, or try to sell some real drugs
Leave Hip Hop to Lost Secret, I'll let you pretend you real thugs
But you not, I asked your mother, nigga
So I went back in time and punched her stomach, nigga
And since I used that ignorant word to rhyme itself
Can I sign a deal, or does my wackness need some help
You so pathetic, blah blah, edit, whatever, fuck what I say
Who the fuck listens to my rhymes anyway
Bring the hook in early, nigga, fuck it

[Chorus 2X]

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
I'm not the mad rapper, but yo, you can feel my wrath
You callin' me old school to diss me, but you don't know the half
The mad hatter's science goes back before creation
Or later when I invented math and started civilization
Triple greatness, with two pillars on either side of me
Back in the days before the Gommorrah type sodomy
What do you think is real? Be careful how you answer
Make the wrong choice, my ASR will give you cancer
Watch your back...

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
