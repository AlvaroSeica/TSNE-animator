[Intro: Sheek Louch]
Talk about it, you don't live it you talk about it
Uh! Talk about it, you don't live it you talk about it
Niggas talkin it but ain't livin it

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
WOO! Uh! Read it and weep on him
His jewelry look cheap on him
Them goons 'gon sleep on him
Late night they 'gon creep on him
Man! Talk about it! (The hood!)
Talk about it! (Them guns!) Talk about it! (Them bitches!)
Talk about it! (Them ones) Niggas talkin it but ain't livin it
We on nigga we just talk about it!
Yeah!

[Verse One: Styles P]
Countin blood money in the telly
I'm hangin up, talkin drug money on the celly
Nice whip, bigger houses (Bigger!)
Bitch ain't blind she see a nigga outfit (Bitch!)
Gangsta mobster, I'm in the outfit
Mafioso, tre ocho
Either pays up or sprays up the po' po' (Either!)
Your gangstas local mine is bicoastal (My word!)
Rather worldwide
I use to sling girl out my girl ride hopin that the world die
(Die!) Heart darker than Gotham
Raised by wolves this rich nigga's a problem 
Know about stardom top down in Harlem
Rock the Apollo rocked out the Garden (Rocked)
Milk white whip I'm lactose intolerant (Huh!)
Yeah I'm the ghost but I got goons and goblins (Yeah!)
Nigga!

[Chorus: Sheek Louch] 
Uh! Read it and weep on him
His jewelry look cheap on him
Them goons 'gon sleep on him
Late night they 'gon creep on him
Man! Talk about it! (The hood!)
Talk about it! (Them guns!) Talk about it! (Them bitches!)
Talk about it! (Them ones) Niggas talkin it but ain't livin it
We on nigga we just talk about it!
Yeah!

[Verse Two: Jadakiss]
Uh! Yeah! Talk about it, nah! be about it (Uh!)
Inquirin minds wanna know, if he about it (Yep!)
Nothin can't really go down 'less he allow it
'Cause his arm in the hood is as strong as a key of powder (Strong!)
Next question is what it cook like though?
And it sound good, but that ain't what it look like though (Uh Uh!)
Life's a bitch and I can't wait to book that hoe (I can't wait)
I ain't no rapper dog I'm a crook that flow (WOO!)
Yo whip cost a half a mil', talk about it (Talk)
When you see my shit parked, walk around it (Walk)
You can just smell my weed and cough around it
Ain't no need tryin to leave your all surrounded (Hmmm)
You 'gon learn to help I is real
When the king talk, can't tell sire to chill
He'll have your body all on the ground with chalk around it (Yeah!)
And that's somethin to talk about so talk about it
What's up?!

[Chorus: Sheek Louch] 
Uh! Read it and weep on him
His jewelry look cheap on him
Them goons 'gon sleep on him
Late night they 'gon creep on him
Man! Talk about it! (The hood!)
Talk about it! (Them guns!) Talk about it! (Them bitches!)
Talk about it! (Them ones) Niggas talkin it but ain't livin it
We on nigga we just talk about it!
Yeah!

[Verse Three: Sheek Louch]
Every verse you tell me what you buyin (Oh word!)
Feel free to just stop lyin (Ha Ha!)
You ain't get a deal yet stop tryin
Why you going through a phone stop spyin (You and me)
Niggas talkin it, it's unfortunate
You ain't poppin nothin nigga put a cork in it (Stop it)
I bagged up kilos for real (No doubt)
I was in the street wavin that steel
Fightin in the street they cut my nigga Bill (Busy!)
When your homies die take time to heal
I've been hard as nail, I swam with the whale
I been had money I just never had the sails
Couple millions sold, probably went gold (Yeah)
The same chick you datin to drink my whole load (Come here baby!)
Don Don the great, nigga I'm straight
But why you on camera if you really movin weight?!
HUH?!

[Chorus: Sheek Louch] 
Uh! Read it and weep on him
His jewelry look cheap on him
Them goons 'gon sleep on him
Late night they 'gon creep on him
Man! Talk about it! (The hood!)
Talk about it! (Them guns!) Talk about it! (Them bitches!)
Talk about it! (Them ones) Niggas talkin it but ain't livin it
We on nigga we just talk about it!
Yeah!

[Outro: Sheek Louch]
Talk about it! Niggas talkin it but ain't livin it
Talk-Talk about it! Niggas talkin it but ain't livin it
Talk-T-T-T-Talk about it! Niggas talkin it but ain't livin it
