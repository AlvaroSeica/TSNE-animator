[Layzie Bone]
Livin legends in your presence, learn the lessons we stressin
It's all platinum, we makin it happen
Livin legends in your presence, learn the lessons we stressin
It's all platinum, we makin it happen
Look here playa I make this money
Nah this money ain't make me
And you better believe that you outta your mind
thinkin you gon' try to play me
Lately, Layzie been grindin
'Member that Thug about perfect timin
Droppin that heat that you keep rewindin
comin outta the cut, look who's shinin
L-Burna, L-Dog, Little Lightning's a go-getter
Still claimin St. Clair wig splitters
Ain't wastin no time with them bullshitters
I'm a heavy hitter, and the game don't wait
so I gotta get down for my thang
Let the whole world know who run this thang
Bone Thugs, and it just don't change
I'm the crook that wrote the book
Showed y'all niggaz how to really get it off the hook
Better do your thang and I'ma do my thang
Better open your eyes and just look
You'll see me, ballin on you bitches
livin life, flawless with the riches
Mo Thugs will kick the real shit
Can I get a witness, can I get a witness (can I get a witness?)
Nigga, little Lay'll get a baller
to make all of these broads in the club wanna shake it
Back it on up to the zipper and break it
'til the thugs on the floor can't take it
Show me love, pump your fists
and when it get like this it's crackin
For all the G's in the house, better chief tonight
Y'all already know what's happenin
 
[Chorus 4X: Aaron Hall] {+ ad libs}
There they go, there they go, wanna let them niggaz know
They don't wanna fuck with me
 
[Aaron Hall]
I got locked up, on the Island with no gat and
All I had was my hands to make it happen
In the back room, watchin a bout, while I'm workin out
Lord I wanna be back on top and that's without a doubt
Beginning, who started this fly shit
All y'all niggaz tryin to copy just get off my dick
Run around with... my own shit
With my name tatooed and a thought that's so elaborate
 
[Chorus]
 
[Layzie Bone]
Thugs up, bustas down
Lay it down, better hit the ground
It's a stick up, on the industry
And y'all better not make a sound
All the exec's, give me my check
No disrespect but I leave you wet
Better yet, nigga snatch your life and I won't think twice
and I go on to do what's next
If I have to flex, well anyway
Little Lay' really been got plenty pay
I got a AK to keep thieves away
Gotta thank the Lord that I can breathe today
Cause in a major way I done done it
This is my mission, believe that I run it
When I wanna get blunted, don't front it
Take a little hit, nigga that's the bomb shit
To the real O.G.'s that'll pimp that game
Eazy-E, in lovin memory
Wherever you at, hope you feelin me
I done played the hand that was dealt to me
Nigga shell out the heat so I'ma turn up the flames
Put it on down, burn up the gauge
Y'all know these rap folks murder a thang
I never heard of you lames - eat deez nuts!
Be real with the homies when I'm out on the streets
I keep it real with the homies smashin beats
Po-po's wanna be after me
but they can't capture me - I'm too real for 'em
Now can ya feel it, feel it?
Nigga is you wit it, wit it?
Now can you dig it, dig it?
L-Burna and Aaron Hall
 
[Chorus]
 
[Aaron Hall]
Pimps should know, you never play a nigga for a hoe
Pimps should know, you never play a nigga for a hoe
Comin at you...</pre>
