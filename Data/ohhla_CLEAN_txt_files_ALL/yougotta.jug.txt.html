Lookin for my friend

Breezly Brewin
Buddy Slim
Juggaknots

ohh yeahhh

[Buddy Slim]
I make a nigga plead the fifth
Once they heed the gift of gab
I'm beatin niggaz like Rocky used to do the beef slab
Then I'm out, but nigga just be beggin for some more
Cause I got the type of shit that's in demand like an AIDS cure

[Breezly Brewin]
The ill shit, the psychadelic type of skills shit
Lyrical Messy Marvin I gets hopin that ya spill it
I'm knockin niggaz on their ass, on their tushie
When I drop the verbs whip a brother like some good pussy
Some try to follow my dick you could swallow
I'm forever in the house like a jerry curl chick on the +pallow+

[Buddy Slim]
So let me just collect the props by the bag
Front on my stats I'm gettin found like your hooker's snatch

[Breezly Brewin]
(Yo it's on) like a rubber when I'm fuckin
Lyrical buckin I'm leavin competition out of luck 'n

[Buddy Slim]
I'm chillin with my pack of chowder smokin alcoholics
But now I think I'll make the crowd bounce like hydraulics

[Breezly Brewin]
It's like that, bussit, (it's like this)
I flows like a 40 drinker when he takes a piss
(Fluid line from the gut)

[Buddy Slim]
Niggaz what, competition best to wise up
I'm funkier than pussy that could make your bread rise up

[Breezly Brewin]
I size up yall corny niggaz and I throws the +volo+
When I'm trying to get some ass I want your girl thinkin a yoyo

[Buddy Slim]
I gives the mic check ya don't quit
Still I have my niggaz open on some mental other shit

[Breezly Brewin]
I puts the hurtin in that ass as if your bowels passed
up in the woods and then you went to grab poison ivy
see my boys and I be on some trick defender of the sender of the lovely
forever slam hotter til +bear botter+ be huggin me son

[Buddy Slim]
I'm callin honeys with loot or as a pauper

[Breezly Brewin]
When girls just wanna have fun

[Buddy Slim]
..like Cindy Lauper

[Breezly Brewin]
haaa but never slackin on the lyrical buckin
cause niggaz biter all my shit like some bad dick sucking

(Chorus)
It's one of these, it's one of these songs
When you're gonna please brothers, give 'em one of these
I'm sayin one of these, it's one of these songs
When you're gonna sieze brothers, give 'em one of these
I'm sayin one of these, it's one of these songs
When you wanna sieze brothers, give 'em one of these
I'm sayin one of these, it's one of these songs
When you're gonna please brothers, give 'em one of these

[Breezly Brewin]
Ayyo, we're not to be fucked with
Like a hooker with the AIDS virus til they try this
Heyo my flow is fatter than that chick Elvira's breasteses
Niggaz test to this and try to knock me on the buttocks
I'll flip it like pregnant women if you try to kick their stomach

[Buddy Slim]
I'm hittin niggaz like a five off night stick
I only write slick ghetto flavour type verses
I'm sending curses on your phone ye niggaz tryna flourish
As I try to fires up the party like my name was David Courage

[Breezly Brewin]
So listen competition can ya hear me
With my flow I'm claustrophobic
I don't want no other motherfuckers near me
Defy niggaz demonic I been troubled as a kid
For Child's Play I was Chucky's stunt double

[Buddy Slim]
Doin all the ill scenes, the kill scenes
I love it when a nigga sleeps

[Breezly Brewin]
C'mon I'll torture you in my field dreams
With nightmarish type thoughts once ya hearin it
Bussit, I raise relief like your hookers lay pity

(Chorus)</pre>
