[ASAP Rocky]
Pass the pass the
Pass the motherfuckin Swisher, pour some motherfuckin liquor
for my motherfuckin niggaz who ain't with us keep it trilla
Wutg ny gold teeth, my french braids, gettin throwed since 10th grade
Wealth is in the mind not the pocket, if that's the case then I been paid
Herringbone chain, my gold frames, my Cartiers, you small change
You bitch made, I'm old school, like gem stars and switchblades
I spit game, I get paid, I pimp game, my pimp
I be that pretty motherfuckin, ASAP is just my nickname
(I'm comin down when I'm tippin on them 4's)
(Cause we shittin on these, shittin on these niggaz and these hoes)
Cause that purp shit I sip up, yo' bitch chose, you slipped up
I get get my dick licked, I'm draped out drip dripped up
Top of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin my mind
We runnin, runnin, we gunnin, we gunnin, we're gonna hit one at a time, time
Them bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe
A weirdo but I'm rare though

[Chorus]

[ASAP Twelvy]
All these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggaz wanna jock 'em
Not a red light, or a city cop that can stop 'em
Going broke is not an option, always on that cash flow
She used to call me asshole, now she drop that ass low
Fuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel stash dope
ASAP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow
I smoke it down, I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up
That's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch
I'm headed to the future, Twelvy ain't no loser
Mixin up that syrup, call it Cookie Brewster
I'm slurrin, wassup? Don't tell me to shut up
I ain't tryin to start shit, but man im really fucked up
I lucked up huh, I see it as a come up
I'm on my job man, I see you when the sun's up
Huh, young niggaz run everything
ASAP to the top, and these bitches love everything

[ASAP Nast]
God bless America, my flow hysteria
Style wild like my nigga Common after Erykah
Yo bitch I'm in bed with her, head so good
Make a nigga feel good to the point I wanna mary her
Hut I be on my pimpin shit, check out my limp and shit
I be gettin money, gettin money, can you get it bitch
Hoes get on my pimpin shit, all aboard, all aboard
Eastcoast motherfuckas makin all the noise, all the noise
I know you niggaz heard of us, Raf Simon murderers
Fashion killer word to bigger boss I never heard of ya
Still sippin candy painted whips is what I'm sittin in
Get yo' chemist whippin up that shit that get these bitches in
New young nasty flow that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Henn'
Business man go defend it 'til fuckin business end
Great adventure shit, roller coaster take a flick of this
Motion picture shit, bitch I grind like a skater do
Always strive and prosper Rock what level we gon' take it to?

[Chorus] - to fade
