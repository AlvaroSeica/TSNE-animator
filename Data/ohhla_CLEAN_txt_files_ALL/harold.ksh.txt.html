[Ke$ha]
I miss your soft lips, I miss your white sheets
I miss the scratch of your unshaved face on my cheek
And this is so hard, cause I didn't see
that you were the love of my life, and it kills me
I see your face in, strangers on the street
I still say your name when I'm talkin in my sleep
And in the limelight, I play it off fine
But I can't handle it when I turn off my night light (ahh) {*2X*}

[Chorus]
They say that true love hurts
Well this could almost kill me
Young love murder, that is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone
The life is fading from me
while you watch my heart bleed
Young love murder, that is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone

[Ke$ha]
Remember the time we, jumped the fence when
the Stones were playin and we were too broke to get in
You held my hand and then, made me cry while
I swore to God it was the best night of my li-ife
Or when you took me, across the world, we
promised that this will last forever but now I see
It was my past life, a beautiful time
Drunk off of nothin but each other 'til the sun rise (ahh) {*2X*}

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
It was a past life (he was a past life)
A beautiful time
Drunk off of nothin but each other 'til the sun rise
('til the sun rise, 'til the sun rise)

[Chorus]</pre>
