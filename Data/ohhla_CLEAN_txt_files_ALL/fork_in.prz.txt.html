[Chorus: Malachi]
How do I get by with blocks in the road?
And how did I get here at the fork in the road?
The choices I'm ?? _??, the world is so cold
Will I be here to ever see my baby ?? grow (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus 2: 2Pac]
Once again! Hahaha!
Once again! Hahaha!

[Verse 1: Stormey]
Time tickin'
It's my ambition as a soldier
and my intention
when the ghetto ghospels you to the masses so pay attention
young and younger for the better things in life, it's a fight
It's a struggle just to live in life, and what's right
But I'm a hustler motherfucker, ___ toes in the dirt
and i'm'a grind for what it's worth, until i'm layin' in the dirt
put in work, to get my ?? ?? ?? ?? ??
so I keep my eyes open, keep my focus and my gun op
I got too much to lose, to much of you
to be concerned about you haters, niggas leave that to you
?? ain't got a clue so I ?? what I ?? for
God got my back, and that's all that I ask for
Raised by the block, (and the folks are old?)
They allways told me at a time, i'd come to forks in the road
I was raised by the block, (and the folks are old?)
They always told me at a time, i'd come to forks in the road

[Chorus: Malachi]

[Chorus 2: 2Pac]

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
I live my life as an outlaw, niggas I'm ?? ??
from the looks of me, you wouldn't know what i've been through
I done seen it all, if I ain't do it, (I was steelin' ball?)
knowing i'm'a answer for that, when the lord call
Tryin' to see them all, while I polish my gun
My baby's mama's new boyfriend raising my son
These young niggas comin' up, now they're worse than we was
if ain't no money splittin' up, tell 'em to ease up
Let's get rich and ?? kick it, I'll be in it
Matter fact scratch that, nigga i'm still in it
So don't consider this a rhyme, consider it life
to live with the verdict, the sentence is life
Me and my niggas tryin' to finish the fight, must complete the mission
we try to ?? them with the streets is ??
that real talk so the ?? will listen ask Malachi
I'd rather die than lose hope my nigga, we hopeless nigga

[Chorus: Malachi]

[Verse 3: Kastro]
I was only 16, young nigga wantin' creamy things
28 now just to see things change
But I'm a player and I'm playin' my part
Knowin' this movie ain't mine, it's gods and he's a star
And it's a wonder how I made it this far
A million miles over in the speed of a fast car
So many choices (Why?), so many choices
it's hell up in my head, I hear the devil and his voices
I'm (stun?), I'm a bum I'm nothin', suicide get a gun, pull the button
Nah, that ain't me, nah, I'm god's baby
But times are kinda hard, livin' gettin' to my lately
I belive even though I ain't (better?)
My days are gettin' better, but only if I let 'em
So here I stand at this fork in the road
Gotta decide wich way I'm'a go

[Chorus x2: Malachi]
