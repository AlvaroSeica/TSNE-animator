[Ke$ha]
I'm in love alright-ight-ight-ight
With my crazy beautiful life
With the parties, the disasters
With my friends all pretty and plastered
Every night we're down to go out
Wakin up on a different couch
'Til the next night, on the next flight
Yeah I guess we're doin alright

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, ohh, we're fallin in love
Oh, oh, ohh, 'til the sun's coming up
Oh, oh, ohh, just livin the life
Oh, oh, ohh...
Every single night we fight, to get a little high on life
To get a little somethin right, somethin real, at least we, try
Time after time, try dodgin all the douchebag guys
Try tradin all the wasted times, for somethin real, in this crazy life

[Ke$ha]
I just hope some people see
There's nothin that I'm tryin to be
Let me just stop, all the {shit} talk
I know I'm the new bitch on the block
I've been through my sketchy phases
Been groped, been a shitty waitress
But I'm not now, guess it worked out
Got here by runnin my mouth

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Every single night we...
Every single night we fight, to get a little high on life
To get a little somethin right, somethin real, at least we, try
Time after time, try dodgin all the douchebag guys
Try tradin all the wasted times, for somethin real, in this crazy life
Oh, oh, ohh {*4X*}</pre>
