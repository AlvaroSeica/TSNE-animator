[Verse One: MC Ren]
Nigga, Villain back for the 08, you other niggaz is bitch
Fucking a snitch, your whole life is a glitch
Your mama was a tripping, given birth to put a bitch on the surface
You niggaz sound like Clones from the Eighties
But what should I expect from the motherfucking crack babies?
Fuck the legend, I'm the West Coast Icon
Eat the big fish swimming in the small pond
This some Compton classic, nigga blaze
Now choke on the gush, for Eazy and the old days
Y'all wanted the Gangster Gangster
Straight up out the hub, fuck the club
And fuck all you niggaz that voted for Bush
Now, your sell out ass is crying for Gas
In the Radio still some facts
With that same bullshit, homie, making me laugh
HUH! who in the fuck tried to sit on my throne?
Fucking with my shit while daddy ain't home
The Villain is back again
Who the fuck you know really fucking with Ren?

[Chorus: Ninetrain]
Y'all motherfuckers don't know
I already fucked your whore
And I'm about to smoke up your weed

[MC Ren]
It's the Return of the Villain, what you motherfuckers need?

[Verse Two: MC Ren]
Most of y'all niggaz need to quit
With all that money and flossy shit
With all the cars, rims and bitches
And name brand clothes, y'all some whores
Nigga, y'all shit watered down
Homie, you're a half ounce and Villain the pound
I'm still Always Into Something
So if It Ain't Rough, ain't fucking us
My black ass gotta cuss, I can't change
Just like your bitch sucking dick at the club in the Range-Rover
It's THE WORLD BIGGEST DICK  ---------&gt; DJ Yella
Tell that whore to move over
She started sucking dick while I'm puffing the Dojah
Y'all need this villainous shit
I can't be fucked with, when I start to spit
Now, who in the fuck tried to sit on my throne?
Now, you fake niggaz can bring my shit back home
Who in the fuck tried to sit on my throne?
Fucking with my shit, while daddy ain't home
The Villain is back again
Who the fuck you know really fucking with Ren?

[Chorus:]

[MC Ren]
It's the Return of the Villain, what you motherfuckers need?

[Verse Three: MC Ren]
If you're a Legend, then Ren is an Icon
If you're a boss, then Villain the Don
You niggaz is nothing but locals
Go and take ten years, go work on your vocals
West Coast's sitting on a commission
The same as before only Eazy missing
But I'm still that Nigga For Life
Smoke up your weed and fuck your wife
Bitch in the corner straight playing the role
Don't talk to the Villain if your ass never went gold
From Compton II to UK, real motherfuckers play me everyday
Homie, here's that Return Of The Villain
About to make these whack niggaz go back to drug dealing
And sell all these studio shit
You sorry motherfuckers, y'all just need to quit
Who in the fuck tried to sit on my throne?
Fucking with my shit, while daddy ain't home
The Villain is back again
Who the fuck you know really fucking with Ren?

[Chorus:]

[MC Ren]
It's the Return of the Villain, what you motherfuckers need?
Who in the fuck tried to sit on my throne?
Fucking with my shit, while daddy ain't home
The Villain is back again
Who the fuck you know really fucking with Ren?

[Chorus:]

[Outro: MC Ren]
It's the Return of the Villain, what you motherfuckers need?
It's the Return of the Villain, what you motherfuckers need?
