[Intro]
Yeah, you wanna get shit done you gotta get it done yourself
{*BLAM*} (Oh shit!)
Yeah, hahahahaha! YEAH!! (let it go)
Yeah, yeah, YEAH!!
Huh, yeah, oh
Go, yes, breathe

[Xzibit]
Man I'm talkin 'bout that six-fo', rag top, clean with the back racked
Everything matte black, colder than a six pack
You know what the fuck it is, and what I came to do
Now put your hands up in the air like I'm about to shoot
My agenda is here, crystal perfectly clear
Breathe apocalypse in, we have nothin to fear
We have nothin to lose, pressure applyin the rules
Bust on a motherfucker and knock him up out of his shoes
That's what my coast loves, good money, great drugs
Every bad bitch you can think of
Swagged out, Loc'd up, flamed on, perv out
Shit-faced from shots, your words come slurred out
Better put the word out, modify the mediocre
I'ma bust it down, serve 'em like a bunch of smokers
You can fuck around, rounds get to flyin over
Ask your little mind is your pride worth dyin over

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Yeah, order in the court, this what you came to see?
The state of hip-hop versus Mr. X to the Z
Now a verdict is in, this the moment of truth
Fightin the fight of my life, jury ready to shoot
I'll be my own attorney, prosecution tryin to burn me down
Testimony testifyin from the underground
Order in the court, this what you came to see?
The state of hip-hop versus Mr. X to the Z

[Xzibit]
Yeah; I create in the dark, darkest place in my heart
I finish off what you started, terror, I'll tear you apart
I am not for them games, I'm the climate of change
Thread the eye of the needle, that means accurate aim
That means I can arrange heinous and hideous thangs
I'm the sickness you feel seconds from poppin a vein
Paranormal presence that people can never explain
Why deal with the devil when dealin with you is the same?
I got a proposition, for all you bitches listenin
Get in position, let me nail it like a crucifixion
Give you what you've been missin, a man in my condition
shouldn't be allowed around crowds without supervision
Call it a superstition, can't get this out my system
I got a fetish for fuckin over my opposition
It's time to set the standard, the mothership has landed
We didn't come here in peace, we came to take the planet

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
Yeah; I come out with them wolves, they come out with them tools
That elevate you out the Earth's gravitational pull
This is not for the weak, this that work for the streets
Mr. X to the Z, motherfuck what you think
Motherfuck what you blog, this for my Loc's and my dawgs
Standin tall, still callin shots from behind the wall
I've been tried and I'm true, reassemble my group
Carry on tradition, position I'm put here to do
Make movements monumental, I done made some improvements
You can check my credentials, told to never pursue it
If I'd listen to critics, there would be no Xzibit
Dreams battered and broken, never breakin my spirit
Listen close you can hear it, the footsteps of the future
Ain't no time like the present, leave the past and excuses
Fucked on everything walkin now I keep it exclusive
You just soft as acoustics, this that real nigga music~!
