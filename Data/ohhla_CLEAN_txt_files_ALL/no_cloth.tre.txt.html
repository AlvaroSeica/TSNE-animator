[Intro]
No clothes on
We back, hey!

[Chorus 2]
I can picture you with no clothes on
Girl I gotta have it, I'm attracted
The way you dancin, lookin back at it
No clothes on
Everybody leanin, I wouldn't mind seein
You snappin out them jeans like you got no clothes on

[Trey Songz]
And I'm so gone
Up in my zone
Baby be the business
You so grown
Baby, oh my goodness
Is this my imagination?
And I hallucinating?
Girl, you so tone
And I just wanna beep it
Let me see your Secret
Let me whisper in yo ear
C'mere

[Chorus 1]
Let me work that thang

Let me work that thang

Girl I might hurt that thang
Shawty what your name is?
Ooh girl, I gotta know
And shawty who you came wit?
Don't take this personal

Ain't no mo' 'tron
If this yo song
Won't you gon over there and do that thang
Don't be 'shamed
By that booty, body, do it shawty, you been naughty
pimpin, attenting the after party
What's so wrong?
I just wanna make this clear
Can I whisper in your ear?

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2] - 2X

No clothes, no clothes, no clothes, no clothes, no clothes on
He like the way I rock my hips
