Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Get yo hands out my hair girl...
Hurrican! (hurrican!) bang bang bang bang bang bang (beat it out the frame)
Say lil mama...

[Chorus]
And I can touch you here and I can touch you there
and I can touch you here and I can touch you there
and I can touch you here and I can touch you there
and I can touch you here and I can touch you there

[Verse 1]
When we got it perfect they try to holla
just tell them get lost when you rubbing yo body
up on me girl I won't tell you to get off
and I ain't fakin when you rubbin yo hands through my hair
got me fellin amazing yo thick thighs and yo pretty eyes
got this yougnster body shakin who am I to tell ya you ain't
got it goin on shakin what yo mama gave ya
girl you bout to blow my dome
from left to the right to the right to the left
slow yo road girl cause this got to be bad for my health
if I had to sacrifice about it part it I go delf
long as I can see yo bady with my eyes
I don't care with a coke bottle shape
got me pullin out my hair man that thang made me dizzy
like a ride at the fair
if a bopper wanna to fight she ain't scared
she got a pair she stand up for her man
leave a bopper out of breath she a dime and she fine
and she all of the above
I'm a touch her while I cut her and beat it up in the tub

[Chorus]
And I can touch you here and I can touch you there
and I can touch you here and I can touch you there
and I can touch you here and I can touch you there
and I can touch you here and I can touch you there
(ooh I like it like that ooh I like it like that
Ooh I like it like that the way you grippin my legs
holdin me down it's fellin so good
I like it like that ooh)

[Verse 2]
I can touch you here and there relax
take off yo underware hit you from the back
and just smack it then I pull yo hair
Baby I'm a beast with it I'm that Hurricane
and I know you heard about that way I beat it out the frame
lil mama says she like my style
and my swaggin how the see thru beads be hangin on my plaids
she saw me on TV and she ain't know how to act
I turn the TV off then I pulled the sheets back
you know me I'm a playa g I be up on my game
I can slay you and touch you in places till you say my name
I know you want me to touch you if not you in the game
sit back relax get a drink get loose and do yo thang
hit you in positions to make you pay attention to change
it's the thoughts in my mersades that get triple X-rated
I'm a do the fool in it and I promise I ain't fakin
but don't get it twisted baby cause you ain't havin my baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Touch it like you ain't get enough for what we just did
so I'm a rush you and beat till you say you want my kids
I'm a dance in it say lil mama we call this the jig
and I go harder than any dude you done had that's the biz
she lookin me up in my eyes I'm grippin her on the waist
I got her whole body shakin while she look me in my face
call yo friends and tell em you just got worked
I'm a fool when I move up the skirts stick and move make it hurt

[Chorus]</pre>
