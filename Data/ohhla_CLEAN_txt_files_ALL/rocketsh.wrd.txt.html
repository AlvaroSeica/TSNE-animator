[Werd]
I am
So fly like a Rocketship
Out this world when I'm rocking this 
So fly like a Rocketship
Out this world when I'm rocking this 

[Kathy McCarty]
Im going on a trip far away

[Werd]
Yo bring that back bring that back
Going on a trip here mate and so are you
With the Scottish rapper
Alude Reekie Edinburgh ken who it is mate its Werd S.O.S.

Got my bags packed its a fact I go
But I come right back like a rap yoyo
Dont rap yo yo no Koko no
Dont sound like a clown that sounds so so
Im Han Solo and I'm solo
I get so high and your still so low
And rock a show with an ounce of snow
Put it in my nose I know you know
Its a big no no to flow no mojo
I stay flash like an instant photo
So bright like lights on popo
Do what I like till they light my logo
From Edinburgh oh no to London Soha
So I can say so hoe blow for more doe
I fuck Uranus and do SaturnÂ’s ring
Im out this world when I do my thing

I am
So fly like a Rocketship
Out of this world when I'm rocking this
Rock this shit

Ship shit thats how fly
I should go stay in the Isle of Skye
How ill I'm I shit skill dont lie 
And check my standards I mountain high
Plus I produce these kids like mothers
Take it right to these cunts no rubbers
And I write rhymes like old Mother Hubbard
Theres no fucking other need doe mother fucker
Done shows in the summer now we back in the winter
Getting under skin like splinters but I'm no mutant ninja
I am no little winger I will win I'm a winner
Yeah I'm hot your a minger aw man I deliver 
Like takeaway dinners take away you beginners
Only see competition when I'm looking in the mirror

[Kathy McCarty]
There is a boy there 
His name is 'X'
He says you dont know me
I dont know you either

[Werd]
Who fuck is you you wee bend
Err in fact I dont want to ken
I got no buddies calling me friend
Im a hang up but they call me again
And its quarter to ten and I'm rocking the pen
So its often a tend to blocking my end
Because Iv no got time to be talking to them
When I dont drop shit I be dropping a gem
At fithteen and shit seems by sixteen
My sixteens where just mean a sick teen
With shit dreams to get green a has been
Thats has been seen before he seen scenes
Before I seen scenes cunt
Lets count just count till you see me
The days so fly call me run away I'm take off
Sing it lassie

[Kathy McCarty]
The stars are blurring
We are going fast
We are going on a trip far away
We are leaving today
Our planet is our Rocketship</pre>
