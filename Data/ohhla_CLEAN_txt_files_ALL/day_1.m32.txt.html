(*talking*)
Yeah yeah, rap game 101 baby
The book baby, boys thinking they can come in this game
And take some'ing, we been here for a long time mayn
We ain't going nowhere, best of the best lie in the South mayn
Houston Texas, understand recognize it
This is where the real roam, this where we at

[H.A.W.K.]
This gift I was given, and this life that I'm living
Making executive, decisions
I'm fighting for position, and I thrive on ambition
Hoping that young people will listen
I'm hoping and I'm wishing, and through my faith as a Christian
That I will soon, complete my mission
Not trying to be a prophet, I'm just trying to make a profit
And put some change, in mama's pocket
These haters try to knock it, but these haters can not stop it
I drop my c.d., and they cop it
Guess what they saying, in they deck my c.d. playing
And some real stuff, that boy saying
See I'm a go getter, and also I'm pretty clever
Nobody does it better
See H.A.W.K., bout getting cheddar
And my flow just getting better, I'll be the best ever

[Hook - 2x]
Been here from day one, ain't going nowhere
We the best ever, fools can't compare
Came up from the bottom, now we're sitting on top
Yeah it's hell up on a hustler, but the game don't stop

[Mr. 3-2]
From the cracks of the gutter, to the South full proof
I'm raw and uncovered, with a hundred percent truth
No acting no slacking, mouthpiece contaminated
Dope game related, in the streets how I made it
If I did it all over, I'd do it the same
Dealing with my ghetto life, I experience the game
Make nothing into some'ing, now I'm working with chips
Re-scoring every night, making profits flip
Stay here and on note, keep it on my mind
Niggaz lying, bumping they head every time
Get in line, when life gon' handle you rough
Be a man, and bitch quit holding your nuts
One of the best, holding it down from day one
Stay cocked and ready, and ain't never gon' run
I rep it, the almighty S.U.C.
Mr. 3 to the 2, it's the G-O-V

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
You can never question my grind, question my rep
Question how I put it down, or how I rep for the set
Cause ever since 15, I held it down for the West
And when the jackers came around, I held it down with my tech
I'm one of the boys who made the block famous
But if the laws ask you shit, dog do not name us
Cause if they ever found out, about the dirt I done did
And won't say O got time, and O say he got hit
So I kept it low to the ground, put my faith in the man
When they said I wouldn't make it, I just stayed with the plan
Had to tune these niggaz out, they gon' hang when the can
But every time a playa drop, I bet I made me a fan
Now....when they see me flossing
And any day now, I'ma be Rolls Royc'ing
Aston Martin, cashing checks and
What the fuck you mean, Lil' O ain't wrecking come on
