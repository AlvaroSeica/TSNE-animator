Song:   When it Hitsya
Typed by: iamomni dot com

[Chorus]
when it hits ya
god bless the child
let him feel no pain
the shit goes straight to your brain
you get the picture
before I go the whole world'll know my name
I give it to 'em simple and plain
when it hits ya
god bless the child
let him feel no pain
the shit goes straight to your brain
you get the picture
before I go the whole world'll know my name
we give it to 'em simple and plain

[Omni]
it's only the beginning
wait until the ninth inning
I love winning
they don't have enough fight in 'em
my work is never done
not until I'm number one
problems come
never run
meet the barrel of a gun
bad men
crown.... tongue
ready here they come
got fame on the drums
I'm having too much fun
watch the beat hit your chest like a shot of rum
sing along and watch the song
and on the tip of your tongue
it's pure
a hundred percent
too much to endure
I'm sick
and there ain't no cure
I'm on tour
like on the mc
child of the night
we play in the dark and battle the light
check every component
however you want it
get you stuck in the moment
and wait for the final hour to strike
for the love of the life

[Chorus]

[other rapper]
it's a code red situation
all these kids is hatin'
catching fists when we spit
emit-eration
real shit you've been anticipatin'
wait no longer
this ain't no song
it's just a way of ventilatin'
stress evaporatin'
me letting off steam like a coffee machine
it's no revelation
I stayed off the scene
but still you keep ???? in the honesty
I do fear some
but none of them have ever been ???
we pay the cost to be constantly mentioned
consequences
calm my stomach ??? from the tension
I lost some friends on the journey and I made some
first thing you need to learn how to separate real from fake ones
made a full time occupation rocking stages
in my spare time we roll and we rock ?? in chocolate papers
cross the state with the taste of success on my breath
destined to rep with a sound you won't ever forget

[Chorus]

[Omni] for the love of the life
other: what?
[Omni] the love of the life
other: ha haaa!
[Omni] for the love of the life
other: we doin' this
[Omni] the love of the life
other: get ??? this
[Omni] for the love of the life

[Chorus]

[other rapper]
it's like that
ha haa
hijack your army
give it to ya nothing but the pure uncut shit
hit you right up in your brain</pre>
