[Toby]
Another beautiful day, I maneuver my way 
through the confusion like I know that the road to the future is paved 
determination I refuse to betray 
so I keep that expression tightly glued to my face 
view through the charade and soon the truth will escape 
I feel like I'm losing my place 
struggling to keep the food on my plate 
undo the mistakes but new ones are soon to replace 
can't hide the regret in the eyes 
but never have I ever let it prevent me from trying 
spent so much time getting ready for whatever that life 
can throw at me that it left me behind 
same ol' job, same repetitive life 
still don't make a decent wage yet for selling my time 
letting it slide cause it's kind of getting me by 
there still ain't no ending in sight, so nevermind 

[Chorus: Deacon the Villian]
Walking in circles in search of something new 
Today feels like yesterday no matter what I do 
Following footsteps that were left by my own shoes 
Chances are tomorrow I'll still have those sunshine blues 

[Toby]
The sun shining down on my face 
feeling out of my place, powerless, allow me the strength 
now, gotta get out of this maze 
that separates the hourly wage from how we escape it 
ignorance is a blissful thing 
cause wisdom brings resistance to wishful thinking 
ya need a little bit to persist 
when things are looking pale 
to set sail when that ship keeps sinking 
keep moving but the pattern persists, hate 
the manner in which they just manage to fixate 
on every mistake, no matter how big 
a man on the brink resisting my animal instinct 
and now I can't even think straight 
got déjà vu, turn the page, I view 
the same things, don't know how it'll end 
for now I'll pretend I'm proud of my challenge to tempt fate 

[Chorus: Deacon the Villian]
Walking in circles in search of something new 
Today feels like yesterday no matter what I do 
Following footsteps that were left by my own shoes 
Chances are tomorrow I'll still have those sunshine blues 

[Deacon The Villian]
I don't have no time 
I don't have no strength 
I don't have no money 
I don't have no faith 
So tell me someone 
where oh where oh where 
are my tomorrows gonna come from? 
cause the sun is shining 
but it don't shine on me, no 

[Toby]
I feel it in the pit of my soul 
realizing how little I know 
trying to find my way on this road 
I gotta make it through on my own 
I look young but I'm feeling so old 
the sun shines bright but the weather is cold 
I've got the blues 

[organ solo] 

(Chorus: Deacon the Villian)
Walking in circles in search of something new 
Today feels like yesterday no matter what I do 
Following footsteps that were left by my own shoes 
Chances are tomorrow I'll still have those sunshine blues</pre>
