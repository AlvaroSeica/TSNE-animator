[Chorus: Pharrell] (N.O.R.E.)
The moment when you see that nigga face again (WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT!!!!)
Replay it in your mind then your breathin change
He's reachin in his jacket he 'gon make it rain
The bystanders screamin lawwwddd!!!!!
The DJ's screamin lawwwddd!!!!!
The AK's screamin lawwwddd!!!!
Bless that nigga's mama's heart
Her baby stretched out on the boulevard!!!!

[Verse One: N.O.R.E.]
Aiyyo! Niggas tryin to shit on me and make history
Supposedly, I help chicks help them with groceries
Supposedly, I still break, grippin my rosary
Still shoot ya nlock up, then make you notice me
(Lawwwddd!!!!) Bullets flyin in the air much
Fuckin heard that guy hurt, I don't even care much
(Lawwwddd!!!!) And I still smoke a bogermill
Still havin street meetings Stop One broker deals
You my nigga nigga fuck how nigga Oprah feels
P.A.P.I. I pop guns, they don't pop me
Known for shootin niggas but nah they never shot me
Hang hang good bell gang, don't make us pop three

[Chorus: Pharrell] (N.O.R.E.)
The moment when you see that nigga face again (WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT!!!!)

Yo! Yeah! I hear you talkin what year nigga whatever nigga

[Chorus: Pharrell] (N.O.R.E.)
