[Chorus: Twista]
A-A-American gangsta (gangsta) U.S. hustla (hustla)
Home of the brave and in God we trust

[Twista]
Chi-Town bred
Cause I gotta rep the city to the death
Annihilate 'em 'til I don't see nothin left
Remember when I spit it for the bitches now I spit it for the thugs
Hat cocked to the right, hat cocked to the left
Whether it's informal, it's a focus on your chest
I spit for the Lords and the Folks and for the Crips and for the Bloods
I'm like the American dream
I roll to the green with the Souls and the Breeds 
and the Cobras and Kings and the two 16
millimeter bullets for the niggaz that'll try to do the opposite
They don't really wanna see how psycho I can get
I don't really see a motherfucker stoppin this
Try to come at you faster than the apocalypse
40-cal'll have you screamin "I don't wanna die!" I am becoming nauseous
with the fake thugs so it's love to the real G's and underbosses
To the niggaz that'll caught a case that gotta do a bid, to get what nobody gave us
We was born into this system so don't be mad at what you made us
Pull a pistol while I cock it and I bust it in the sky, one time for the U.S.
For turnin my niggaz to gangstas cause gettin money is what they do best
Product of the environment, element of Al Capone, gangstas is bosses
K-Town is the motherfuckin hood, the block is the company, come and step into my office
I'm a

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Forever see me in the 'llac
Got work but you never see me with a pack
A motherfucker say he never see me with a strap
And I heard a motherfucker say he don't see me up in the hood (what?)
Lil' nigga I don't see you (nope)
Cause homie my hood is worldwide and gettin money is what we do
Make ya knee joints lock when I freak you, hit the 3-point shot like Hedo
TÃ¼rko?lu on work you killin the game like 'Pac, nigga we point Glocks like he do
See you, don't wanna recognize that I'm the mayor of the Midwest
I'm like "For real?" (for real?)
Controversy in the middle, I guess I'm like Shaquille
You can go on feel like ya feel, nigga know the haters I would like to kill
But if you can hit me with the thangs, a lil' cheap for shit, let's strike a deal
Got the psychos in the city rollin with me 
ever ready to bust a cap if they didn't like dude
I can bury ya body like an animal because I'm a cannibal
I eat a nigga like food
Rippin through your vest so I can devour your heart, music is my playground
But if the rappin don't get you
I hit this head with the back of the pistol and tell the bitch nigga lay down
Ain't no competition, they had to be fuckin with the Twist
Whoever comin for me just die
I'ma get it every time I wanna get it and I'm livin proof, it's a category F5
