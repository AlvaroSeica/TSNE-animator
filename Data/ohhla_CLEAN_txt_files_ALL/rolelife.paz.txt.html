[Vinnie Paz]
This is Rock of Gibraltar rap
The Springfield M-14 show you where the coffin's at
You muh'fuckers don't belong in rap; fuck with me
you got a better chance takin an abortion back
You lack flavor, put some sauce on that
I went to the Great Wall, put my fist through and walked through that
Where this muh'fucker's fortune at?
I'ma levitate his body, make it spin like a laundromat
Muh'fucker I was born to rap
I've been makin records wild long, never did a song that's whack
How many have accomplished that?
I was wild as a young boy, shouldn't have put moms through that
Vinnie Paz been to 'Nam and back
I ain't never put the guns down cousin so my palms is black
You a bitch, I ain't involved with that
I got a big trunk and that's where Vinnie keep all of his corpses at
BRRAP~!

[Chorus]
Life, this role of life

[Vinnie Paz]
Silverback gorilla walk through the minefield
We don't see eye to eye how you define real
Y'all are wonderin if I'm out of my mind still
I just need some liquor and pills, and I'm chill
I run with Puerto Rocks, Morenos and vagabonds
And Paz will shoot this motherfucker up like Barry Bonds
I'm like a military doctor, Vinnie carry arms
My shit is military proper, Vinnie carry bombs
I "Kick in the Door" like B.I. did
And the automatic weapons look like T.I. crib
Vinnie fat, you'll never see my ribs
I don't call it loadin bullets, I refer to it as feed my kids
All I think about is slaughterin y'all
This little muh'fucker named Charles Hamilton is harder than y'all
Hahahahaha~! It's in the garbage with y'all
Listen to all you MySpace rappers, I'm a father to y'all

[Chorus]

[Vinnie Paz]
I write in the rain, turn beautiful night into pain
I turn life into a frightening game (a frightening game)
I don't have love in me, it's just ice in my veins
My fist Hammer of Thor, I Tyson the game (BRRAP!)
This rap shit deep in my heart; y'all was sleep from the start
But that just led to unbelievable art
And on top of that the God is unbelievably smart
My bare fists turn trees into bark (trees into bark)
Y'all don't want any improvement at all
Y'all are devils, y'all are torturin the rule of law
My mind is a computer of war
And it's typically the biggest muh'fucker that'll usually fall
(BRRAP! BRRAP!) Give me one take cousin, the God out
A forty of Ide, a Billy Dee and I ride out
Hahahaha... the 40 Glock poppin your eyes out
Now you never get a chance to see what the God 'bout
Hahahahaha... BRRAP! BRRAP!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
