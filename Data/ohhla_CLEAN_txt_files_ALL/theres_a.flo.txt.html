Song:   There's a War Going On For Your Mind
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

There is a war going on for your mind
Media mavens mount surgical strikes
from trapper keeper collages and online magazine mics
Covergirl cutouts throw up pop-up ads
infecting victims with silicone shrapnel
Worldwide passenger pigeons deploy paratroopers
Now it's raining pornography, lovers take shelter
Post-production debutantes pursue you in NASCAR chariots
They construct ransom letters from biblical passages
and bleed mascara into the holy water supplies
There is a war going on for your mind
Industry insiders slang test tube babies to corporate crackheads
They flash logos and blast ghettos
Their embroidered neckties say "Stop snitchin"
Conscious rappers and whistleblowers get stitches
made of accupuncture needles and marionette strings
There is a war going on for your mind
Professional wrestlers and Vice Presidents want you to believe them
The desert sky is their blue screen, they superimpose explosions
They shout at you
PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE MEN BEHIND THE BARBED CURTAIN~!
Nor the craters beneath the draped flags
Those hoods are there for your protection
and the meteors these days are the size of corpses
There is a war going on for your mind {*static breakup*}

We are the insurgents</pre>
