[Verse 1]
My nigga holla bang bang as the cops pass
cause just the other day they tried to rob the stash
jammed up his cuz now he called from the pen
they got him praying for his bail so they won't take his kids
cause his baby momma act out, she'd done backed out
sold everything in the house cause she cracked out
he turned to me so much pain in his eyes
like he ain't know being black and po came with a price
he took a toot as if it eased his mind, 
his nose running heavy cause he geeking lines
clientele pulled up in a beamer truck served the driver and he said to me
"they got us all fucked up"

[Chorus]
when a stone don't settle
I cant hurt forever
how can I do better now?
They got us all fucked up
break my back for nothing (for nothing)
lock me up for struggling
only god can judge me, now
they got us all fucked up

[Verse 2]
I need a nasty freak to shake that ass for me
she said whats happenin' whats up yeah this ass ain't free
I got a friend if you want her, wait I could phone her
everything have price cause christmas around the corner
since the recession its been hard if you strippin'
cause niggas pay to get in but niggas ain't tippin'
short on rent landlord trippin 
tired of eating noodles that taste like chicken
don't really like hoin ain't hard to tell
but when all else fail pussy always sell
song stop spinnin' and the time was up
snatch the money off the floor and said
"they got us all fucked up"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I had a partner called pimpin
had hella women say he raw dog chicks and never ever went to clinic
now he thinks something wrong and he scared to check
he got a girl that he claimed never cared for sex
so he slept on her, crept on her, sometimes he even
pushed to dying and he stepped on her
one of his cousins buddy called him in and it got him freaked
say she had a checkup and she got HIv
claim is all his fault screamin raised her hands
cause she got two kids and what about her man
he thought about his girl hopped out his truck
called her phone and said as low as he could
"I got us all fucked up"

[Chorus]</pre>
