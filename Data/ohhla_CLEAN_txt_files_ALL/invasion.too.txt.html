[Intro]
"'Scuse me, Miss, do have a headlight?"
"Yeah, sure, somewhere in here"
"Yeah, come off the motherfuckin' purse, bitch! Huh! Gimme this motherfucker huh!
Gimme this bitch. Yeah! Fool!

[Bar None]
See I was born with a motherfuckin' curse
I got the habit of snatchin' the bitches' purse
First I take a fuckin' hit
Of this potent-ass shit

Let it rush to my brain, make me click
And let it tell me what bitch to get with
I knew once I taste that seed
Layed up in this potent-ass weed
I was fittin' to do a funky-ass deed
But I don't give a fuck, follow my lead

I got my eye on this bitch, yeah I'm scopin'
I bet her motherfuckin' ass steady hopin'
That I ain't fittin' to do nuttin' fucked up, shit
Far as I'm concerned, I done lucked up

She's standin' in front of the bank
I guess her motherfuckin' ass gonna think
Which way her ass oughta roll
But it don't matter, 'cause the bitch gettin' caught
She can even run, I'll catch her
Nigga I'm a motherfuckin' purse snatcher

Any hoe walkin' out the bank
You know the bitch packin' that hank
And I'ma catch her ass real swift like
Man, motherfuck this daylight
Cause long as it's a motherfuckin' sun
I'ma stay a fuckin' fugitive on the run

In other words, I ain't gettin' caught
After I get this bitch, I'ma show ya what I'm 'bout
'Cause I don't give a fuck about a motherfuckin' slut
I'm takin' from hoes, tryin'a make a buck

If the bitch slip and think she got good luck, haha
Her motherfuckin' ass stuck
If she die, I got mine I don't miss her
And give the purse to my little-ass sister

I don't regret shit I do, nigga
If your bitch slippin' - I'll get her ass too
Smoke 'em square, I give a laugh then a look
Then a few steps another bitch got took
Fuck it, I ain't givin' no lecture
Just beware of the motherfuckin' purse snatcher

[Ghetto MC]

Standin' downtown around five is when they get outta work
Time to catch a bitch sleepin' - they sleep or stay alert
Here comes my motherfuckin' chance, there goes one
I knocked her down, took her purse, and started to run
Dumb bitch didn't even give chase
She must've heard what I done to Miss Grace
If the bitch would've fought for the purse
Her ass would've left in a motherfuckin' hearse

Now I'm back on the streets of 5th Ward, bein' hard
I'm buddin' ready to catch another bitch off guard
She's dressed in white, I figure she's a nurse
But motherfuck what she is, I want that goddamn purse
Ran by and grabbed it, I must've snatched it wrong
Next thing I knew, the fuckin' chase was on

Ran about a block, that's when I snapped
Oh yeah, she just ran into a trap
Let her motherfuckin' ass keep comin'
And she'll wind up a dead-ass woman
Came like she was bad, rode away in a hearse
Dumb bitch should've gave me the fuckin' purse

I had to show the hoe I wasn't soft
Took the shit from her purse, then I blew her fuckin' head off
Another bitch I have to capture
'Cause the Ghetto MC's a motherfuckin' purse snatcher

[Bar None]

Bar None can't get no fuckin' work
They tryin' to keep me in the same damn t-shirt
Funky-ass bosses won't hire me
Well at least the motherfuckers can't fire me
I'm tryin'a get a job and do the right thing
And they're still lettin' a motherfucker hang

Bitches look at me all strange
But all that shit's fixin' to change
I'm puttin' my 9 in my goddamn nuts
And fittin' to drink a 40 on the motherfuckin' cut
Now I'm standin' in the middle of the circle
Fittin' to beat the shit out this punk named Urkle

While I'm whoopin' the hell out this bitch
I got my eye on this hoe I'm gonna get
I knew I had all y'all fooled
I'm a motherfuckin' purse snatcher too
She got her ass sittin' at the bus stop (*pop pop*)
Urkle just dropped

Brothers running to the left
Brothers running to the right
And the lady's in my goddamn sight
Purse hangin' off the hoe's shoulder
Bar None fittin' to damn sure T-Roll her
Ran over, kicked the bitch in her thigh
She bent over and I hit her in the eye

Then the hoe started to curse
Meanwhile - I snatched the bitch purse
Took off fast like Flash
And forgot about her motherfuckin' ass
The hoe's cryin' I betcha
Just beware of the motherfuckin' purse snatcher</pre>
