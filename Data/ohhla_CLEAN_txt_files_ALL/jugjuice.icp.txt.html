Crack that fat boy let it go loose
Drink it, spay it
Whatever your use
Do it up like Joey, and Big Joe Bruce

Throw it up in the sky to sooth that itch
Slap it up silly and boot that biiiitch

Two in each hand
Flake out and shake
My nutbag taste like Faygo Grape
Explode in your bedroom
Faygo lake Marinate your steak and bake
Faygo cake
It's cheap as hell
And fuck I'm broke
Fuck three bucks for a cup of Coke Shit
I stay sticky
Fuck the soap Orange Pop all on my dick please though
I mix it fix it fuck I kicks it
Off them titties I gotsta licks it
Take out the fixtures, chandeliers
Fuck a venue to nice to handle this
Rock and Rye bounce from above
Knock you out and fuck up your duds
Explode and unload all over the place
You don't like Red Pop
FUCK YOUR FACE!!

[Chorus]
Just let it fly

Into the sky (Yep)
My Faygo HEEY!!
Don't wonder why (Whooooaoh!)
JUGGALO JUICE (Yep, yep)
Until you try (Yep)
My Faygo HEEY!

Too much juice shorts out the power
Dance in the dark of the Faygo shower
Sugar rain insane Flavors, colors
We'll kick yo ass
But we love each others
Through the floor, into the basement
But it ain't wasted, more we taste it
Seeps on through to the pits of Hell
And puts out the flames where the devil dwells
Faygo storms, rain and thunder
No need to wonder
It's too much fun to just unwind
Put yourself under the trance
Pour some down your pants
Hump it, hit it, get wit it
Bust a nut and be geeked ya did it
Precious Peach, and Bubblegum Pop
No need for a mop cause we don't stop!

[Chorus]
Just let it fly
JUGGALO JUICE (Yep, yep)
Into the sky (Yep)
My Faygo HEEY!!
Don't wonder why (Whooooaoh!)
JUGGALO JUICE (Yep, yep)
Until you try (Yep)
My Faygo HEEY!
