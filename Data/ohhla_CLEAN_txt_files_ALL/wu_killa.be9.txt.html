Eight men... four women...
Oh, that's the jury of love...

[Chorus 2X]

[ShoGun Assason]
Yo, I'm from a broken home, where the foundation's all fucked up
That's why I really don't give no fuck
Cuz the only luck I struck, was bad, and good times
Was seldom seen like dad, here one day
Then he's gone like a fad, angry adolescent
Roaming the world like a nomad, trying to get that shit I never had
Like a savage in the pursuit of happiness
If you was around, you could of prevented this
But I guess my papi had other business
That's why the streets raised this baby crazy
I smoke to keep the pain away from me, I'm Atlas
Holding the world's weight, G, trying to bench press
The stress off my chest, and release some shit that I got suppressed
It's burning like hot off the press, your boy gon' bang to the death
I'm the best, I can't settle for less
With this power to pimp the pen, I possess, possess

[Chorus 2X]

[Chorus 2X]

[Beretta 9]
Killarmy, check it, yo
They say, the darker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The Vodka, get very, I'd the Goose
My glock got you parry, I'm matching the tooth
Beretta, bring track to the airy, jail a beat in the booth
Be leary, cuz shit's real like no frills
Unpaid bills and no deals, I done told ya'll niggas
I'm just VH1'ing it, yo, ain't no fun in it
My hoodie got a big ass hole, I got the gun in it
Life in the bottle, dippin' out of lanes
Full throttle, what's up with that nigga B9?
Nothing, it's called hunger pains, still hop in the train
My family's like, what's wrong, nothing, trying to maintain

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
