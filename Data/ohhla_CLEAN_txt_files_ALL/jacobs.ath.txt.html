Typed by: Atherton

[Atherton]
One synth, tambourine and a wood block
A little more than the less that the hoods got
Big dreams that'll never see a Woodstock
A Warp Tour or a dotted line from Sub Pop
But this indie rap kid likes to think
in daydreams that he's on the brink
of uhh...
of something
Something great, something pure, something painful
that'll meet you in between love and hate's angles
Around the corner from the corridor of the coroner
Therefore hah-hah, the breath ain't strangled
Breath inhaled puts air in the lungs 
to vibrate the chords for the song to be sung
so uhhh...
so start singing

[CHORUS: repeat 3X]
I climbed Jacob's Ladder, only to find
myself down at the bottom again
I climbed Jacob's Ladder, only to find
myself down at the bottom again
I climbed Jacob's Ladder, only to find
myself down at the bottom again
I'm at the bottom again
1 - Heh, so start singing
2 - Ehh, START SINGING~!!
3 - Ohhh, hallelujah

Bop, bop, hallelujah {*8X*}

[Outro]
Someone wrote that most men live lives of quiet desperation
But surely there's more to it than that
If I hear just one sweet baby laugh, without hesistation
Well - that's it, that's it!</pre>
