One two, one two, yo

(*DJ scratch* that you don't know what you've got til it's gone)
Now you realizin when them nights go long, right
Campaign for me to stay when you know that I'm gone, right
You act all wild, when I tell you to settle
I was workin round the clock, but your girls want to meddle
("I heard!  Knahmsayin?  I heard that you was on the beach...")
Talk about I heard he swims with this chick on the beach
That was out with the tide, but my love you impeach
Now you lookin at the walls, head in hands, cold jonezin
Ringin my house, hangin up and then posin
Now why you wanna go and do dat love, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do dat and do dat huh?(repeat 4X)
