Typed by: ja_rule@lowrider.com

Hey ese, at least some groups of little mocosos
We were born to represent the Raza
Hey man I didn't get asked to, I was jumped into this motherfucker

To all the lifers doing time, keep your head up loco

The thirteenth razon to be a Sureno is
Hold your ground and put it down en las calles where you live
Let's give thought to the twelfth, in your mind picture wealth
Getting your slang on strong for your family and your health
We break dough how we roll up in this hustle game
Just for razones, I won't explain
Razon numero once, es algo que conoses
y union entre pandillas living Sureno Vida
Some locos are with it, others choose to go broke
Respecto for fuckers that call the gun smoke
Hell yea, you know the deal ese always keep it real
Razon numero diez, pack your fucking steal
Cuz they will catch you slipping, they will pop their clip in
And these Thirteen Razones are why these locos tripping
Some stake you in their chest and go out the back door
Wicked from Brownside here to make you fiend more

[Chorus]
Some don't want to hear it, but fuck it yo te enseno
Trece razones to be a Sureno
This is the way it should be done ese, remember where you're from
Trece razones to be a Sureno
One think we know is we have calle control
Trece razones to be a Sureno
Our lives and quettes cursed, the Brownside brought it first
Trece razones to be a Sureno

I break it down to number nine, this is one you keep on mind
Put in work to pay your dues, remember always roll with trues
Numero ocho should be something that we prove
Like moving the celdas as Surenos proudly move
Breaking fools left and right, when I explain it comes tight
Living life as bandieros, catch you slipping do you right
Some get to see the inside, others don't participate
Razon numbero siete is to get out all the hate
That we create while growing up, end up not giving a fuck
Temper's a hair-trigger, that's why vatos learn to buck 
And duck to leave the scene, number six is for the fiend
Addicted like a clucker to this gangster dream
You see, what we do is jump in to the neck
And I'm bringing it real, so what you see is what you get
Number five never hide, you take it with you when you ride
In Spanish it's orgullo in English they call it pride

[Chorus]

I'ma drop this last verse, don't forget that I'm the first
To bring the curse of pistolas and that Super Sport hurst
There's a couple more razones, but before I get to that
Know that all of us Surenos never hesitate to snap, just like that
Now you know, here comes number four
It's survive in these streets cuz they stalk you hardcore
So watch them close, eventually they'll creep
And if I'm not mistaken, we're on reason number three
Now you know all the rules but this one makes you choose
It's a seed that gets planted and grows while you pay dues
Now who's down with their pride? Number two can't be denied
So I'ma let you putos know, it's still the Brownside
Porque we don't hide nada like the rest of them chavalas
What we can't handle with words, loco we handle with balas
The primero razon is to have corazon
And if your hoods respect it, ahi te haces cabron

[Chorus]

Trece razones
To all you gangsters from the 213</pre>
