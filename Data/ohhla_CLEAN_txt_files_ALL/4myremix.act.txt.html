[Intro: Action Bronson] (LL Cool J)
(Queens!) Better slow down baby! Uh! One two one two!
Uh! Better slow down baby! Just pulled up to the club! On your mother's back!)

[Chorus: Action Bronson] (LL Cool J)
You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby (Aiyyo Action!)
I'm a hero in my hometown baby (It ain't no fun if the G.O.A.T. don't get none!)
Stop talkin just go down baby 

[Verse One: LL Cool J]
The ripper, the master, charismatic bastard
Game is strange like blondes ramadan fastin
Indoor pool look like Uncle Luke's castin
Never too old to fly fake bubble assin
Peep the rhetoric nobody could better it
None of your confederates I'm daddy your a surrogate
Murdered these mics boy felon after the predicate
Fuck what you heard baby that shit's all irrelevant
Third is fly y'all half as intelligent
Step on that horse shit like animals elephants
Watered down garbage ass rappers relevant
All I wanna know is how the fuck y'all sellin it?!

[Chorus: Action Bronson] (LL Cool J) (*Action Bronson)
You need to slow down baby (Slow down)
My whole team cash and load out baby (You know!)
I'm a hero in my hometown baby (*Flushing!)
Stop talkin just go down baby 

[Verse Two: Action Bronson]
In front of Queens Center Mall leg up on the sweatpants
Same mouths in every country that the jet lands
Jetlag just left France
UH! Stuff a motherfucker face into a bedpan
Shimmy in a GMC Jimmy
So I could make it since like Mike Bibby
Nice titties on a dyke that like swimmin
Smokin dro rollin dice in white linen
'89 Testerosa will I fit in?!
The jeep's so big make you wanna take a shit in it
Your bitch been in it, treated her mouth like I was primitive 
I talk shit 'cause I'm livin it
It's me!

[Chorus: Action Bronson] (Lloyd Banks)
You need to slow down baby (Slow down baby!)
My whole team cash and load out baby 
I'm a hero in my hometown baby (Hometown baby!)
Stop talkin just go down baby 

[Verse Three: Lloyd Banks]
Uh! I'm a mack she 'gon hook a nigga up on the expressway
That neckblade thousand dollars in my x-ray
Light the park like when the Mets play clean as a fuck
We make a mess hey I'm beamin on up
Twenty bucks twenty women spend my evenin on stuff
I get alot on clockwork, in my sleeve with the cuff
They know what's up? Young black and hungry in the presidential
A hundred somethin diamonds buy eleven special
Take in a moment while your roamin
I set the trap set back watch my glow when
Designer logo on my uni while I'm rollin
Crowded pockets in the Louis bag of Trojans
Banks!

[Chorus: Action Bronson]
You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby 
I'm a hero in my hometown baby 
Stop talkin just go down baby 
 
[Outro: Action Bronson]
You need to slow down baby 
(I'm out here but don't ever fuckin get it twisted!)
I'm a hero in my hometown baby 
(We on the strip friday night! It's lookin like the award show!)
You need to slow down baby 
(Catch me with my bitch! Hair color hot sauce!)
I'm a hero in my hometown baby
(Oh man look who just fuckin pulled up! Whattup? It's me!)
