Wanting people to listen you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore
You have to hit them with a sledgehammer
And then you'll notice you've got their strict attention

[Mr. Hyde]
No fucking gat kid my favorite tool is a hatchet
There ain't that many weapons more brutal then that shit
I'll settle for a bat a metal one at that
Bash you with a tea pot kid and call the kettle black
Torture with fork lifts twisted on your porch this
Weapons assortment got you lookin awkward
Sharpen the pencil and penetrate your eye
Heartless but gentle a splendid way to die
Shackle in jooks but still grapplin hooks
Drop your lost corpse off in back of a bush
So I prefer to bust jaws and the murdering buzzsaws
In terms of total damage the burner does more
Twine is used to strangle tire irons mangle
Police disbelieve what is underneath your Kangol
Bares the resemblance of fruit gettin blended
Use a cross bow to shoot your appendix
Stomp you with cleets to halt your heart beat
Or sharpen my teeth and tear apart fleas

[Chorus]
Kill with a drill clap with a gat
Maim with a flame or hack with an axe
Scorch with the torch jooks with the hooks
Every weapon I use rearranges your looks
Choke with the rope crack with the bat
Stick with a pick or snap with a strap
Carve with a large knife and you're trife
Every weapon I use puts an end to your life

[Mr. Hyde]
You could be shot with the glock or clocked with a rock
Cue balls in the socks for knockin your block off
Sawboard tools can be used to deplore you
A fork or a corkscrew duke I assure you
Die til you're dead with the pliers and thread
I can close up your legs or open your head
An african spear packed in your rear
Axe is the maximum laxative here
A blowtorch inches way as it singes
AIDs blood filled to the brim in syringes
Sledgehammer slam chisels in chest
Watch the read drizzle and drip from the flesh
I lust to create a much rougher fate
Pillows cover your face as lungs suffocate
Though chinese stars might leave scars
Swords get applause when the slice out hearts
Diced into parts much smaller then ants
I likeded the part with gore on my hands

[Chorus]
