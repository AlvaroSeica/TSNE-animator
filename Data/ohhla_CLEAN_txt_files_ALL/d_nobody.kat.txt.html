Yo
For all the niggas in the D
Yo
 
Cos' don't nobody care about us
All they do is doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us
Don't nobody care about us
All they do is doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us
 
I bet you never see a million MC's if it was all about
skills
Puffin' on blunts
Sucker sporting Tommy Hil
Figured that that stuff would be so fat
Like the rhymes I bust
Yeah you didn't hear me cuss
Not yet
But it's about to get live in this bitch
You hoe niggas done ruined my high
Now I'm in your shit
Makin' hits while you other suckers be ridin' a dick
Bringin drama to your clique
Like Susan Lucci
Your style played out like MC Brains and oochie coochi
That shit died out
You couldn't keep up with the times
You got to move over
These real niggas Â‘bout to shine
Like my
Diamonds on your punk ass in the sun
I bust flows to keep you hoes on the run
Detroit Phat Kat
Straight from the mid-west
Never mess
Chicks stay fresh like money blessed
No second guessin
The wrong nigga to be testin
Fuck around Swanson'll be your place to rest in
 
Yes, yes, yes nigga
 
So don't nobody care about us
All they do is doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us
Don't nobody care about us
All they do is doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us
x2
 
I'm that guy who made you suckers wanna rap
I'm the nigga who put Detroit on the map
Then no hiatus
Come back and get props like the greatest
Rockin' the latest (yeah)
That's why you phoney niggas hate us
Hearin' you ho's got my right hand itching
I've been rippin' flows way before the days of the rhythm
kitchen
Phat Kat
Born and raised in this bitch
Niggas claimin' my city don't even stay in this bitch
All in they raps
Busting caps, sellin' dope
You do fine with your crew
But still can't ante a casino (broke nigga)
Broke niggas peel me
While real niggas feel me
You saw me stickin' your hoe you still couldn't peel me
Sucker
 
Cos' don't nobody care about us
All they do is doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us
Don't nobody care about us
All they do is doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us
x3Don't nobody care about us
They just doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd usDon't nobody care about us
All they do is doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us
 
Hey yo I see we got a
Up to me we got to many niggas fakin
Lying on their digs and all the moves that they makin
Chance they taken'
Trying roam through my zones
And twisted
The place where Phat Kat calls home
Where niggas talk twenty four hours
On Bernie Mac phones
Catch me at a show
A spot's guaranteed to get blown
Know niggas with hearts so cold
They froze like stuck holes in the winter
You's a beginner
Tryin' to test this vet (nigga)
So when you
See me on the streets talk to me quick
Because you, never know what the fuck you might get
So dig it
Sugar, sugar and, um, sort of soft
If you didn't get off
It ain't my fault
Remember that (Phat Kat)
Comin' with nothing but the vintage
????????
Line up your group, let's have a scrimmage
While you
Portraying images you seen on TV
That shit is gay
I told you niggas that Detroit don't play
 
All they do is doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us
Don't nobody care about us
All they do is doubt us
Til we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us
x3
 
Yo
You know what I'm sayin
These niggas is snakes
You know what I'm sayin
Do your paperwork
Cos this shit is no go
For real</pre>
