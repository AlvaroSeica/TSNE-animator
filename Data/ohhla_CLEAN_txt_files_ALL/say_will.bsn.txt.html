Song:   Say You Will
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

As I hop on this red eye flight with all red eyes
Hoodie over my head, recognize a Jedi
If I go too fast down this road I end up like left eye
I'm wondering would it be better if I left
My girlfriend know I got a fetish for fine hoes
I'm worldwide so she know I'm gonna find hoes
Sneaking in my iPhone
Looking through my call log
It hurts looking at her face to ask her why she crying for
I'm so fresh I'm wondering why I didn't design clothes
This rap shit is something that you gotta be designed for
Meetings at the label saying they goin make Sean blow
Turned the radio on and do I hear Sean... no
Man please do not gimmick me
Put me on the shelf and not remember me
And treat me like a John Doe
I wish that I could drop my nuts in they're tonsils
(Ahem) shut up bitch swallow
And I been signed to Ye for well over a year now
It's clear now, I'm a focus on my career now
You taught me to create a process
Saying that you changed my life
Dog it's me being modest
But honestly I wish that I could take you off tour
Put you in the studio
So you could focus more on my shit
And I don't mean to sound selfish
But I am not an artist that's self-less
I'm feeling like a crab in a bucket
That's just tryna get it crackin
Amongst all these fuckin' shellfish...

And it's a dream come true that you signed me
Big Sean, G.O.O.D. Music signee
People asking me how it happened
Man I tell em I rolex the situation &amp; just have perfect timing
And you already know where to find me
Bitch I connected to the D like Siamese
So if you see me out of town getting money
Know I do it for my city and I be back very promptly
So say what up if you see us
And the D is probably rubber &amp; the Sean man lead us?
Like being undefeated, feeling undefeated?
Dick so big I bust a nut for a fetus
Glad to do any interview or dope feature
Come holla at a nigga as I'm trying on sneakers
Niggas making diss records in efforts that I see it
Waiting on my reply but they never will receive it
You are not half of what I am and can't be it
You are just a 101% bitch
Recognize a star like you pledge to the allegiance
And I don't want fans, I want believers
Race to success so I'm a keep pedalin
Cause my mama man, she deserve everything?
So if I find a girl with beauty and brains like her
Then best believe she gon get a wedding ring
But I don't know if I believe in love to be honest
Cause every girl love the headliners
Take her to my hotel all my niggas there
And best believe they gon give up all a head line-up
And that's why girls wanna leave us
Tell em where we are but they never gone believe us
Won't stop till we in end up on that show, Cheaters
But I bet you couldn't spot me if a nigga wore cheetah
And I be in the strip-club Teasers
Giving all the girls what's needed
Honest dog had so many problems dog
I could hand em out and be labeled a fuckin teacher
So respect my hand gesture
I dare any nigga try and come test us
You a mothafuckin act dog
A A.C.T. that's why niggas try and test ya
A dub how the hell we gonna make a mil
Pay the bills man I ain't tryna waste a deal
If you could make a deal believe you could make deal
And if you can't keep your promises then don't say you will... nigga don't say you will</pre>
