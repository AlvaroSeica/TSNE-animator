Pre-Verse: Mr. Lil' One
I'm still up in your ghetto
Still got to go when narrow

(Main Verse)
You don't want it with me, but gotta wait too long
King of the west, Mr. Babylon
Fools, in the street, wanna babble on
But when they see me in the street, wanna tag along
Shake 'em off, oh, please believe
Shoot, for the kill, oh, yes indeed
Pull up your weed, and you can have my plea
Stack my loot so handsomely
Better believe, I'm in the mix all day
Y'all wanna hate, got a price to pay
Triple O.G. since back in the day
Little mama, come around, cause she love to play
Slang that, motherfucker, better ask around
Karma little way, to the underground
I've been doin' it all, and I'm a do it again
So dangerous, WHO THE MEXICAN?
Who is sick in the mind, Mr. 619
Fine, to their mind, everytime I rhyme
Passin' along, 'bout to kill the game
U-N-O, you remember the name
Mr. Sick, in the mind, wanna talk sublime
With a fine ass dame, that I brought on my side
Make up a lie, so I can buck 'em all
Say you'll be alive, then we FUCK YOU ALL
If I go, I'm a come, I'm a bring the pain
Everybody in the crowd, that will scream my name
Sayin' "Lil' Uno, man, we love you so
Please never go, when you deal the flow"
What am I to do, I gotta give it to you
You been followin' my work and everything I do
I owe it all to my people now
The baddest of them all with a sequel now
Heard about the weak, and the way they speak
Got 'em on repeat, when I'm on the beat
Obsolete, still givin' the creeps
Sickofied, seven days a week
Better beware, don't take me there
Smile in ya face, everytime you stare
In the world, full of sin, from the hood, to the pen
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW WHERE THE FUCK I BEEN
Can't fuck with us, I'm ridiculous
Ash ya to ash and the dust to dust
Watch who you love, who you lust to trust
Miraculous, everytime I bust
Since a little bitty child, I been showin' you how
Lil' Uno in the crowd, can't fade up the style
Salute me, boy, wanna execute
You ready for the war, better get your boots

Chorus: Mr. Lil' One
I'm still up in your ghetto
Still got to go when narrow
Another homocide guerro
Just missed a rap level

[Mr. Lil' One]
Ha ha ha
Yeah
You don't want it with me, boy
It's Lil' Uno, baby
Sicko Records
Sicko Camp
Ha ha
To the last day
All day, boy
Yeah
Yeah (Yeah...)</pre>
