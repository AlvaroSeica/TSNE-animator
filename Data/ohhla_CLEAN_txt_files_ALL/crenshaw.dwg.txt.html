[LIL' HAWK]
One, two, motherfuckin' three, nigga it's time to bail
It's that Crenshaw Mafia Gangsta (WOOP! WOOP!) time to kill
Lil' Hawk, S.P., Young June from the Lanes
Red flaggin', saggin' and bangin' like it ain't no thing

[TINY LOC a.k.a SPIDER]

Young gangsta ballin'
Blasting on these Rickets now I'm ?? what they be calling

[LIL' HAWK]
And even Bloods like like Crabs so you know I stay strapped
Cause Crenshaw Mafia and Denver Lanes be like ten and more straps

[TINY LOC a.k.a. SPIDER]

[JUNE DAWG]
Well it's me, the nigga June comin' straight from my hood
With the gat consider me strapped because ?? that how I stood
The capital F-L-OW- that's what I bust when I flow
I rush a 4.0 from the corner liquor store

These Rickets can't handle this cause Lanes too skandleous
Bree stick him up, Young Buck is a jack'
But no, they not
Never about the strap that I pack

[LIL' HAWK]
Is a burn? Is a flame?
No, Blood, it's me!
C-M-G 1-0-4 when I bail thru the door
I never giving a fuck, cherry Chucks will be on my feet
M and the L once I bail thru these motherfuckin' streets

I put the biggety nuts ??? they ass ???
And when I exit the hizzouse
Niggas be hangin'
But only West Side Crenshaw Mafia you niggas can't fade this

[JUNE DAWG]

The strap's in my hand now tell me who's the man
Oh yes I can

[LIL' HAWK]
Ain't no bitch
