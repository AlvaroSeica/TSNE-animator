[Necro]
I'm carvin' a carcass
I'm a starving artist
Like Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer when they recorded Tarkus
I'm a commando knocking you out like Fernando Vargas
Similar to Brando in Apocalypse
I'll burn you like the eyes of cyclops when he drops his shades
You can't stop the blades
You get crushed like you're in the back of a garbage truck
Now you just cartilage
Mushed like the Battle of Carthage
My archers bring carnage upon my arch enemies
Sacrifice like a Partridge
Calico cartridges are a God's gift during beef
With 15 cats where 16 caps wouldn't do it
I need at least 150 rounds to lay them all down
Dead forever
Exposing their red fluid
Boxes of bullets for coppers and oxes
Obnoxious
Rockin' a wool rich Arctic jacket
With a doo rag over my optics
Ratchet
Glock cocked ready for action
Like Seagal
Force you to pop locks 'til you fracture you bones
I manufacture the dopest narcotics to hit since crack hit the streets
In capsules a few years after Blondie's Rapture

[Chorus: Necro]
The flow is South of Heaven
Satanic underground
Death metal rap
Progressive verbal shredding
South of Heaven
Street shit
You know the steelo
I'll be stabbing you in the jugular vein of your neck
like Joe Pesci in the beginning of Casino

[Mr. Hyde]
I got a bad blood fetish
Split open your lettuce
And bust through your whole crew like Jerome Bettis
The police dread us
We're sick and elusive
Who put massacres on the channel with news clip
Don't you slip
The tyrants are waiting for your downfall to shove many blades in
Straight up degrading
Spittin' the hardest
Shit you ever heard turned you into a carcass
Marxmen, hand-gun's licking at random
Empty out a clip then dip like a phantom
The circle of serpents villains you worship
We're hexing the Earth with curses and verses
Ain't no stopping the doctrine of death
I'm shocking like rocking an ox in your neck
On the prowl stalkin'
Patiently hawkin'
Sittin' on your couch waitin' for you to walk in
Ambush, attack with an axe in your back
Drippin red like a strawberry daiquiri, black
I'll carve my name in a slain victim
Sluts I abduct
get fucked, and drip cum
Change up the flow
Kill every hoe slow
I hang around death like Brandon Lee's Crow
The tyrants taint your headsets with death
Bleed cd's and rape your tape decks

[Chorus]

[Goretex]
Industrial sludge
Thuggin' for goons
Buggin' out my jail bitches
Stash and blastin shrooms
Acid too
Dipped up
Juice from caskets
Then I rock the venison mask catch 2 in your basket
Reign in blood
The reason we take drugs
The reason we rape nuns
The demons stay caked up
We laced up
Young pig tails clipped for purchase
Call 'em ??? now he's setting fire to churches
Earthless
Stay up in the telly with nurses
My verse will reconstruct the face tissue on virgins
You know you heard of us
Hit the cranium
I'm just a quiet kid
Bricks of Uranium
I see the haters in faggot knapsacks
Keep it real
85, exodus back patch
Glenwood reps it
Howie with crack packs
All eyes on me
Turned fitteds to flapjacks
Marinate, let the crack settle with rebels
Sit and get behind the money
This is black metal
The young wizard behind the wall of sleep
Whatever my dreams
My minds playin' tricks on me
Oh man, homie
These chicks wanna piss on me
Stuffin pills in my mouth
Tie me up and kiss the beast
Suicide girls throwin tit to me
It's it for me
Ain't no mystery
It's misery
Hit the symphony

[Chorus]</pre>
