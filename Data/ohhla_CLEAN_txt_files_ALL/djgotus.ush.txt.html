Usher Usher Usher, yeah man

So we back in the club
With our bodies rockin from side to side, side-side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life, back-back to life
Hands up, and suddenly, we all got our hands up
No control, of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes eyes eyes, eyes-eyes eyes

[Chorus: Usher]
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
So dance dance like it's the last last night 
of your life life, gon' get you right
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again (love again)

[Usher]
Keep downin drinks like there's no tomorrow
There's just right now now now, now-now now now
Gon' set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherf.. down down down, down-down down down (c'mon)
Hands up, when the music drops, we both put our hands up
Put your hands, on my body
Swear I seen you before
I think I remember those eyes eyes eyes, eyes-eyes eyes

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
Usher, don't lie..
Hear no evil, speak no evil
See no evil, get it baby?
Hope you catch that like T.O., that's how we roll
My life is a movie and you just TiVo, heh
Mami got me twisted like a dreadlock
She don't wrestle but I got her in a headlock
Yabba dabba doo, make her +Bed-rock+
Mami on fire, psh, red hot
Bada-bing, bada-boom
Mr. Worldwide as I step in a room
I'm a, hustler baby, but that you knew
And tonight is just me and you
Dale

[Usher] + (Pitbull)
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
(Mr. Worldwide, yeah, let's take over the world)
Yeah baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love (dale)
Let's go - falling in love, OHHH!
So dance dance like it's the last last night 
of your life life, gon' get you right

[Chorus] w/ ad libs
