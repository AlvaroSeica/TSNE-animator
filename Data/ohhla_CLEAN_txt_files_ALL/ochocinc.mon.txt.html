Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: French Montana]
I see you niggaz from the side watchin
Got 100 grand in my side pocket
All the hustlas love it you know I speak the lingo
Tell a bitch give me head
(Ocho Cinco) [x3]
Told that bitch give me head
(Ocho Cinco) [x3]
Told that bitch give me head
Ocho cinco

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Face down ass up, pull up in that spaceship with that top down
Bitch pass out, chain light up they blackout
I'm like haaanhh ochco cinco thats a head banger
I see a bitch lookin thirsty told her gon drink up
I head hunt, that new nigga, and what
Shorty got that ochco good head, and butt I'm like (coke boy baby)....
All I got for bitches is pipe water, I came up off a night order

[Verse 2: MGK]
Bitch gave me head till my legs shake
She gave me brain that doesn't explain why these lames
be lovin and cuffin these bitches I don't nothin bout em
But they head shake, fuck that pussy till her legs break
Bustin
Got a dirty dozen of them wild thangs waitin in a room like an egg crate
Uhh p.a.d, boy ho, and I got b.a.d bitches for my boys so
Don't treat em like boy I'm servin, black suburban
swervin, thru the hood gettin head like curtains
Any job a good job
So she get a blowjob
Suckin it from 9-5 that bitch workin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Los]
Man I say pimps up, hoes down
I say that to say that I only recognize these bitches with they lips up, or from the nose down
I tell her nose dive, then watch em go down, woop [5x]
Bitch I'm cold as ice water, put dick way down yo throat until yo eyes water
Lemme get that for ya, lil mama cause you workin
The way you twerkin, you could fuck around and get a Birkin
She like to crack the dutch down the middle
Drop a Purp in, let me fuck her in the telly
Screaming open up the curtains like
You know French cut, she got on French Cuts
I don't french kiss, I let my friends cut
Me and Red in an all red Benz truck

[Verse 4: Red Cafe]
I told french I told los I get good head while I'm chaffeured
Momma told me get a nice girl with a good head on her shoulders
Shake down shake downnnn
Came up on them back blocks
Her face on my belt buckle thats what I call (lap top)
Side niggaz from the side watchin, guess they got a side view
Puff got me in this penthouse
Thats my view
Thats my crew, they shinin
She on that cain so she could come boss
And her first choice was the number one boss
GOT EM

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Diddy]
Yo bitch, I 'm a mothafuckin livin legend
I'm bout to send these niggaz thru they fifth (depression)
In my absenses niggaz speaking silly
I could stand on the mountains and the streets will feel me
Feel the rush and that bad boy
O.b.g and the OG don't OD cause thats bad boy
She feel royal when she 'round this
King Combs now get me crowned bitch</pre>
