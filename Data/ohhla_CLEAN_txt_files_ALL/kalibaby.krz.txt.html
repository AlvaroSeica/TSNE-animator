Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Alright alright alright alright
You've seen him on stages around the globe
Fellas, get jealous
Ladies, scream if you want to
I knew you would
He go by name of Krizz Kaliko but y'all can call him Kali
Kali baby

Kaaaaaaaaaali baaaaaby
Kali baby
Kaaaaaaaaaali it's show out time

The whole wold buzzin' on the snake and the bat
Now we the best, never takin' it back
Without a reason people know that we're breathin'
Once we see them we know they never leave
Haller it out when they see him
They used to make fun of him, now they wanna be him
If they say they're better than Kali don't believe 'em
They cold and they sneezin' and I be the reason
They took the long way but name away
Not all but grateful I'm makin' a pay day
I'd love to say I'm still on my pay day
Hip hop I get washed away if I don't stay

If you ever heard of Tecca Ninna then you heard of him
If you listen you can hear him screamin' cause he runnin this.
Kaaaaaaaaaali baaaaaby
Kali baby
Kaaaaaaaaaali it's show out time

Now wait, can I pick up one? Can I pick up one?
Which one that want, to have some fun
Yea, you and me both
Always been the little ladies, they that call me Kali Kali
If you wanna kick it baby momma don't bring her around me
I pick up the ball and if you drop niggas can stop the heat
Get your rimmy ballin' but ballers somebody stop me
Yes, I'm the guy with the thing on his eye
My music is dope and I'm gettin' high of my own supply
I come to shizny and I swear Krizz is the business
We got you girlies girlies glistenin' from listenin'
As long as you within rope and it's so awful when you so broke
I got car around my wrist and I got a house around my throat

Kaaaaaaaaaali baaaaaby
Kali baby
Kaaaaaaaaaali it's show out time

I think I love 'er
I think I love him
I drive her crazy
He drives me crazy
But I say
With what he says he makes me wanna have his baby
Kali baby
Kali baby
Kali baby
It's my lady
Kali baby
Kali baby
Kali baby

I think I love 'er
I think I love him
I drive her crazy
He drives me crazy
But I say
With what he says he makes me wanna have his baby
Kali baby
Kali baby
Kali baby
Uuuuuuuu
Kali baby
Kali baby
Kali baby

Kaaaaaaaaaali baaaaaby
Kali baby
Kaaaaaaaaaali it's show out time

I will not stop rappin'
I will not stop rappin'
I will not stop rappin'
I will not stop rappin'
I will not stop rappin'
I will not stop rappin'</pre>
