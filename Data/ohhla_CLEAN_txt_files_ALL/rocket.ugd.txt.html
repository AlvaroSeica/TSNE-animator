[U-God]
Yo, Yo, Yo, I be that rocket launcher that caught ya
Rock of Gibraltar, Spill blood on the alter
Sorcerer, Flying saucer in the Porsche
Money exhaust, The enforcer of the lowest bars
Fist of the Northstars, Water on Mars
Thoughts like a porn star, Born scarred
War Lord of the snow ball, Break dance on cardboard
Fiends knaw for the raw, Mark four
Hard jaw like Mexican, Next to win
Crack a Beck's yo I'm vexed again
Next to run, Revolving door, Killing floor
Searching for the genie's lamp
Arrow in your heart like Beanie Man
Seeded plant full blown, See me vamp
Wolf fangs, Full moon, Full spoons of oxycotton
Catch him at the Roxy, Spot him up in Harlem
Honey with the knocked knees with the foxy bottom
News paper column, Say he's scary, Fuck the fairy ass niggas
Jump back in your rat hole, And throw another hail mary
Style very, I'm the cherry on top
Money phase done lit up, One, Two, Three up
Your popcorn shrimp, I'm the whole re-up
G's up and hoes down, Fake as the game is
I blow down the whole town
Let off a whole round, Ghetto celeb
One thing's for certain a hundred years from now no one really cares
Smoke threads, Pro Keds, Coke heads, Mopeds
Fiends fight, Peace pipes, Yo I'm outta here
