[Chorus]
Now I was doing it big all on my own
Gripping woodgrain and riding on chrome
Sprinkling game everywhere that I go
cause all these horny girls want to fuck
Now I was old school riding, slamming my doors
Reclining, shining like a pimp s'posed
Life ain't nothing but an EQ of highs and lows
and it's so, an EQ of highs and lows

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Well I got more than your amount, what's in your account?
Young Krizzle, the newest out the South so it's going down
I think you a hater if you can't see that I'm player
with this evil major leaguer and these fuchsia alligators
Shawty got me fucked up, I'm never slipping, never tricking
for no treats that ain't for free up on these streets if it ain't Halloween
And why these boppers on my dick? I swear they tryna fuck my whip
Vibing cause my paint was candy sour apple green
I pull the baddest broads up out they drawers and barely wave
If you ain't winning in this game, then you've barely played
If you ain't buying what you want, then you barely paid
Didn't see me out, then you can barely hate, cause I was

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Well I got everything you want, everything you need
Damn right I'm the coldest nigga out, you liable to freeze
Never ever bring your girl around, she liable to leave
She ain't never been around a pimp, she was dying to see
I'm Mouthpiece at his prime, the flyest of the freshest that was freshest of the fly
I'm majoring in pimping, I'm just rapping on the side
for the Benz with the trim and the teriyaki tires
and a plane that don't take off if I don't ride
Oh so live like Pay-Per-View, I'll show you what paper do
Make her pop it and drop it, slide back and forth like a fader do
My bezel incredible, swear my vessel was hater-proof
Only me, myself and I is who I cater to, cause I was

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T. - singing]
I'd rather be with you-ou, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you-ou, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you

[Chorus]</pre>
