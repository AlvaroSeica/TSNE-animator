Typed by: westbingmanson@gmail.com

[Chorus: G-Money]
Love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
I said love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
It ain't no love, it ain't no love

[Mopreme]
It ain't no love fuck the love
See I'ma thug wid mad slugs
And trippin' off these hoes up under my rug
Blind and I can't see sometimes
This Remy Martin got me high
Givin' my shit a try,
My people doubt me why
Hey, I'm way too fly
Thinkin' everybody down wid me until I die
Just like in a nightmare
Straight to fuck from nowhere
Nine's in yo back like you ain't seen jack
Now sticky situations make a motherfucka feel
Like going straight to hell cause at least hell is real
I'm holdin' shit down like a motherfuckin' vet
I'm a real nigga doin' real things, and that you can bet

[Chorus: G-Money]
Love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
I said love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
It ain't no love, it ain't no love</pre>
