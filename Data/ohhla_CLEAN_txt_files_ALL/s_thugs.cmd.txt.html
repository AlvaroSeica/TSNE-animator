[C-Murder]
I started off as a street thug pushin' dimes
A million dollars in the safe but it's drug money
some niggas died so some of that shit's blood money
An no regrets I spend my cheddar wit a smile
I'm buckwild like a muthafuckin' juvenile
Incarcerate me reabilitate me in the pen
An fuck tha world my own momma turned me in
These muthafuckas got the whole game fucked up
I got them golds &amp; a rag now they bucked up
I started off as a street thug pushin' dimes
I flipped tha game on em' now the whole block's mine
These niggas know my trigga finger ain't nothin' nice
Cause I'm droppin' fools so them niggas think twice

[Chorus: C-Murder &amp; (Magic)]
I got them golds &amp; a rag now they bucked up
I started off as a street thug pushin' dimes(we muthafuckin ballers)
I got them golds &amp; a rag now they bucked up
I started off as a street thug pushin' dimes(ballers)
[repeat]

[New-9]
Down for my man Dolla Bill it's bout that time
Post bail half step shit I'm bustin' for mine
Bustin' rhymes for mine
Doin' crimes for mine
Get in tha way you'll be layin' in that pond for mine
Boy I'm slangin' that nine killa just ask the police,
Tha Feds, tha ATF man they all know me
I ain't trippin' off no muthafuckin' nigga on the street
Marchin' on yo block &amp; we ain't scampin' our feet
See I'mma ball til' I fall nigga
From tha blocks to tha burbs
Rocks tha word same nigga street hustler multitalent
I give a damn if you then crossed our path
An you think you cand handle it glock busters

Chorus(2X)

[Magic]
I'mma ball nigga
You seen me in tha mall hollerin' at them broads nigga
Wit my back against the muthafuckin wall nigga
Magic in mack mode
I'mma fool nigga pimpin' tha tightest hoes
Spendin' cash like I'm sittin' on a couple of mills
Wit all my bitches in line them hoes payin' my bills
They respect this
Ain't tryin' to see me pissed
Cause I'll send em' to bed without this Magic dick
Don't give a fuck about a nigga
I figured you niggas don't wanna see this nigga ball
ya'll wanna see me fall
But I'm the shit nigga
Just look at the crowd go wild when I spit nigga
An that's the real cause we muthafuckin' ballers
