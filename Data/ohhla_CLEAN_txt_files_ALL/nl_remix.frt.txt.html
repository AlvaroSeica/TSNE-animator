Let's go! Yeah (Green Lantern)
Mike Shinoda, aiyyo Green
Tell 'em what the name of the mixtape is
("Fort Minor: We Major") Let's go!

Yeah, peep the style and the kids checkin for it
The number one question is "How could you ignore it?"
We drop right back in the cut
The Evil Genius track and Mike's raps got you backin this up
Like rewind that, just rollin with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop, lyrics of life livin
Not to be forgotten but still unforgivin
But in the meantime there are those
who wanna talk this and that, so I suppose
Gets to a point, feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreadin the dirt
It's like

[Chorus: Chester Bennington - using voicebox]
Tried to give you warning but everyone ignores me
{"I told you niggaz nine or ten times to stop fuckin with me"  Jay-Z}
But nobody's listening
Called to you so clearly but you don't want to hear me
{"I told you niggaz nine or ten times to stop fuckin with me"  Jay-Z}
But nobody's listening

[Mike Shinoda]
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more
I'm ridin on the back of this pressure
Guessin that it's better I can't keep myself together
Cause all of this stress gave me somethin to write on
Pain gave me somethin I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear and
Trash talkin and the people it was to
Whattup to the Militia and the L.P.U., ha ha

[Chorus]

[Mike Shinoda] + (Chester Bennington)
We got a heart full of pain, head full of stress (nobody's listening)
Handful of anger held in our chest (nobody's listening)
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat and tears (nobody's listening)
Y'all watch your back, Machine Shop is here!

[Green Lantern] "Fort Minor: We Major"

[sample of Kanye West's "We Major"]
"C'mon homie we major; we MAJOR?!
 C'mon homie we major; we major
 C'mon homie we major; we major, c'mon"

[Mike] Let's go!</pre>
