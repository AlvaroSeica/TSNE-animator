[Verse 1: Rican]
I'm high like a bird, let me fly like a jet
Boricua, the island, Jamaica respect
This is for the raza, so hot that it get
Up in the club and my tank top ripped
Drinking so much, next day, I got sick
Back in the club with another fine chick
Shakin' that ass, I feel the bass hella kick
If you can't get in
Don't ruin my shit
All poor to the streets, yo, I run this shit
Take me back to the house, mami, come right here
Twist up a Garcia, girl, get me a beer
Turn on the radio, mami, dance right here
Girl, I love, how you smile, how you do that there
Yeah, I love, how you smile, how you do that there

Chorus: Gabriela
Oooh
I really like the way you workin' it
Papi, let me know what's on your mind
I'm feelin'
So sexy
Girl
I smell the trees flowin' up in the air
Papi, let me know what's on your mind
I'm feelin'
So sexy

[L.T.]
Sexy, girl

[Rican]
(Verse 2)
Ready in my ride, even though I'm always cruisin'
Represent west coast, you know how I do it
Laced with my jeans, bald head with the sag
White hat back with the black doo rag
Blunts in my pocket with a full sack of weed
Only chronic in my system when it comes to trees
All I need is this brew and I'm deep with my crew
And I'm all up in the club, papi starin' at you

[Rican]
Shake
Mami, mami
Shake for daddy

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Microphone check, mic, microphone check
I catch, wreck on the set, no disrepect
From New York to East Los, yeah, you gets checked
I got the fat green chronic sacks you can't get
Please approach the squad, the God we respect
Bald head and bark loud like DMX {*barking*}
CK calogne, I cruise on the rims
Cadillac tonight, tomorrow, I'll take the Benz
Came through at three, she brought two friends
Up in the club, hun, I'm mobbin' again
Let me get her naughty, yos, mami, here's a toast
Take a ride to the pad, I live by the coast
Damn, mami, damn, mami, I
I see
Yeah, I love, how you smile, how you do that there
Yeah, I love, how you smile, how you do that there

Repeat Chorus

[L.T.]
Oooh, girl, what's on your mind

Go 'head, girl, get next to me (Next to me, yeah)
