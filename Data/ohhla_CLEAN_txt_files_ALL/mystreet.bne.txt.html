(Intro, news interview with elderly lady)
Yeah, she has a gun and I went and got her a gun permit!
Now they didn't have to shoot that old lady down like a dog...
They didn't have to do that! It's one old woman in that house!
I got burglar bars there to try to protect her...
I got mercury lights out there to keep it BRIGHT and LIGHT!
I'M AS MAD AS HELL! AND SOMEBODY'S GON ANSWER TO THAT!

(News reporter)
Police are defending the shooting death of a ninety-two year old woman
Happened as plain clothes officers burst into her home last night-
-to server a search warrant for drugs
Police say they made an undercover drug-buy at the house earlier in the day
The womans' niece said, "there were never drugs in the house, and her aunt-
-lived alone and probably just panicked"
The family's furious

(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
It's so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It's so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It's so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can't pass us by, no more

(Verse 1, Krayzie Bone)
Chillin' on my mama's front porch, I'm watchin
Sittin here reminiscin' on how hot the block is
From right here, I can truly see how crooked the cops is
My vision gettin blurry as I look at my options
I could; just let 'em drop me, or I could cock it and pop it
The way they murdered Oscar was preposterous nonsense
They talkin with they Glocks, conversation is violence
And they wonder why society is criminal minded
They never gon' change, come around my way
Another one shot down; slain, while the cop got praised
It's hard to maintain, when they supposed to protect us
You or me could be the next one; bleeding injustice

(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
It's so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It's so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It's so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can't pass us by, no more
It's so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It's so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It's so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can't pass us by, no more
    (Krayzie Bone)
Even though the world shows no affection
You gotta keep it movin, got to keep on steppin'
The Man upstairs is our only protection
It's very necessary, He remember this is temporary

(Verse 2, Wish Bone)
Time's gettin all bad, but it was good up in yo neck of the woods
Everybody tend to they own hustle, got much respect; that's all good
Turn on the news, it's no surprise to see; Police brutality
And worse they out here gunnin us down in the street
Good use of authority ain't even in
Rather, the vast majority of them's to damn incompetent
When is enough gon' be enough, I ask?
I know we all tryin'a live life free from all the madness
It's sad enough you gotta watch how they get jacked
But the worst one's the criminal that's hiding behind the badge
You try to call up the baby, a waste of time to call 'em
Cause the only thing they bringin is mo' problems, so why bother?

(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
It's so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It's so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It's so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can't pass us by, no more
It's so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It's so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It's so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can't pass us by, no more
    (Krayzie Bone)
Even though the world shows no affection
You gotta keep it movin, got to keep on steppin'
The Man upstairs is our only protection
It's very necessary, He remember this is temporary

(Verse 3, Bizzy Bone)
The Biblical, lick but literal little old me, I kicks the cynical
It's beautiful livin the minimal, generals and don't go to sleep until ten o'clock
I'm more alive, please try to fight evil
Me and my people, my people and me; I'm still single
And even though I look meager; I'm eager to make some money
My partners smoke in the direction; My protection from dummies
Hold your head like, bass; got my head gettin stuck
Cause I acted a fool, got sued, slip and slide, what

(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
It's so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It's so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It's so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can't pass us by, no more
It's so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It's so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It's so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can't pass us by, no more

Even though the world shows no affection
You gotta keep it movin, got to keep on steppin'
The Man upstairs is our only protection
It's very necessary, He remember this is temporary

(Verse 4, Layzie Bone)
Lookin around here and I see the inner city, it makes my heart hurt
Feelin the struggles of my brothers, it takes some hard work
Bein raise by single mothers, the case was caught first
They got daddy in the pen, gotta face the laws worst
No got us, we down, we barely surviving, and knowledge is there
They ain't providing, they starvin us out to keep us divided; so they can get money and hide it
Operation Silence; the government got some secrets they ain't tellin
Cause if they let you know, they can't convict you felon
But they ain't slippin, let the Thugs know the deal
We comin back to save the ghetto, let the truth be revealed
If we all get on a level, and example some skills
We can all get out of debt, and we can pay off these bills
And just chill

(Hook, Bizzy Bone)
It's so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It's so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It's so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can't pass us by, no more
It's so many ways to die (Oh, no)
It's so many ways to fly (Steady as we roll)
It's so many ways to rise (High-high-high)
Cause life can't pass us by, no more

Even though the world shows no affection
You gotta keep it movin, got to keep on steppin'
The Man upstairs is our only protection
It's very necessary, He remember this is temporary (Temporary-Temporary)</pre>
