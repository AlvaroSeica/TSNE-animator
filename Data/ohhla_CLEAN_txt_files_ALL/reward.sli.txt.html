Song:   Reward For me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Everyday my heart is sore
It seem that I'm so poor
But I shall not give up so easily
There's a reward for me
There's a reward for me
Though I'm boarded down with shame
Still there's no one here to blame
But I shall not give up so easily
There's a reward for me
There's a reward for me
There's a reward for me

Everyday sing
There's a reward for me
Everyday my heart is sore
It seem that I'm so poor
But I shall not give up so easily
There's a reward for me
There's a reward for me
There's a reward for me
Everyday sing
There's a reward for me</pre>
