[Lil' Eddie]
Finally I see what people really mean
when they say that love will blind you
it happened to me and I'm so thankful for you baby
since the day we met you changed my life around
the sun is just a little brighter now
the kind of joy you bring is oh so special to me baby

I dont think I ever
felt like this before
I know that I never
met no on like you
I dont think I ever
had a love so true
I dont think I ever

[Mario Winans]
When you come around I cant help but to smile
girl I gotta say I like your style
say that you are down to be forever faithful to me
since the day we met
you changed my life around
the sun is just a little brigther now
the kind of joy you bring is oh so special to me baby, baby, BABY...

[Lil' Eddie]
I dont think I ever
felt like this before
I know that I never
met no on like you
I dont think I ever
had a love so true
I dont think I ever

I dont think I ever
felt like this before
I know that I never
met no on like you
I dont think I ever
had a love so true
I dont think I ever

I dont think I ever
felt like this before
I know that I never
met no on like you
I dont think I ever
had a love so true
I dont think I ever...</pre>
