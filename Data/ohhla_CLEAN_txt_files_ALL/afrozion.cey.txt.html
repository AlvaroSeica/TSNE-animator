CHORUS SCRATCH: THE AFROCENTRIC ASIAN 8X

I murder dem and don't beg no friend
the origin to the east life began
June22 beats banging no comparison
I be eating what you sleeping on it's embarassing
and apparent when snakes infiltrated the garden
trying to blend in shapeshifting reptillians
I'll take em out quick before they shed another skin
start it with my swordplay how I swing the pen
using the voice of Jah while they sound like a jynn
comprehend your life on the mic's bout to end
out of darkness came light and ini transcend
the ways of the western world and the hearts of wicked man

THE AFROCENTRIC ASIAN 8X

like the goddess kali chopping off a demon's head
I'm godbody green gold and the red
dreadlock hiphop orthodox I've made the planet rock
with the godfather Bam on the wheels for real
stop look and listen Ras Ceylon been on a mission
me June vibing a tribal mystic
you hiding like the british did when Ghandi spit
I'm south-Asiatic don't ever forget
Afrocentric means grounded by roots
and real rap music is the sound of truth
its a crowded room but with ease I breathe
cuz it comes from within like theses styles I free

THE AFROCENTRIC ASIAN 8X


Peep how they knowledge ain't deep demolished you weak
washed up with no wisdom spinning at 33
while I'm 360 for 7 days miss me with that Eurocentricity
tricknowldegy shifted the paradigm to look upon my kind
as the wretched of the earth when we the first to shine
rebirth divine time in tune with mother nature
honor the ancestors live through the creator
Sellasie is the greator son of king David
write a verse chant a psalm to the Ras Youth
is sacred he found you naked in a wilderness lost
know yourself in this time cuz babylon is red hot
