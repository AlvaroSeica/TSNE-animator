Just lookin at you, I can see your star
Gotta tell you girl I'm impressed 'bout how you are
Everything is lineing up perfect with no Flaw
The only thing you need is someone like me involved

To break you all down, I know you've been waiting all day
Just get rid of those clowns and i will show you the way
Stop hanging around, we can paint this town
until the lights come down on you,
and make you famous

[Hook]
Ohh, Girl, I can make you famous, best believe I can make you famous

[Verse 3]
(Yeeeeeh eeeeh yea, I feel like I'm famous)
when I'm broke in a ma'fucka drove to the club
in an ugly old school V-dub bucket

(Yeeeeeh eeeeh yea, I feel like I'm famous)
I don't give a fuck, I'm buying out the bar
that seventeen, thirty eight Remy Mar'
Brought it hard, Imma call three broads
To manaja twa, in my Adidas
Not loui vuitton dwag, these kncok-offs
I'm tryin' to get my papers like Peter Popoff
Late night BET need a bear cloth
savin my money like so dead lost
sex tapes like I'm wrestling -beu tokes- ?
Smoke weed, doing shots, it ain't my fault, so

[Chorus]
Bounce, Bounce, Like you famous
jump, jump, Like you famous
shake, shake, Like you famous
dance, dance, Like you famous
drink, drink, Like you famous
Fuck, Fuck, Like you famous
Pose, Pose, Like you famous
HOLD UP. Bitch I'm famous

Yeeeeeh eeeeh yea, I feel like I'm famous
(that seventeen, thirty eight got me go!)
Yeeeeeh eeeeh yea, I feel like I'm famous
(that seventeen, thirty eight got me go!)</pre>
