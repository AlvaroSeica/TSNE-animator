[Steve Knight]
Sunshine feelin' static through your body you don't know what's going on
Then a creep crawl the mind bends bet it all then cash in and be gone
Cause it's side corners and street lights
caught in this haze and I hear them callin'

[Chorus] (Steve Knight)
I hear that train just callin', callin' me home
I hear that train just callin', callin' me home
I hear that train just callin', callin' me home

[MC Piper]
I had a dream that everything wasn't the way it seemed
Martin was the President and Malcolm the VP
Bush wore a rubber and W was never born
We never bombed Nam and never went to Desert Storm
Little babies was birthed to ladies and grown men
Instead of gangsters and bitches not knowing were to begin
Because we born into this world to die trained to kill steal and lie
Raised to sin just to survive framed cause if we caught we fry
Somebody save us they said the saviors comin'
But if he ain't got nuclear weapons he should keep on runnin'
Cause they bombin' the palaces churches and temples and mosques
We got the freedom of speech until yo ass get shot
Where's the train

[Chorus]

[Steve Knight]
Sometimes the candlelight is brighter than the sunshine darkness is long gone
Diggin' my soul still not knowing what's going on
Four in the morning a thousand miles away from home
Glassy and tight eyes reddish and off white oberserving the ice
Swimming in my cup until it's right cause it's midnight
I'm in the devils daughter and it's so tight
I'm doin' it 'til I'm gone midnight
I'm in the devils daughter and it's so tight
I'm doin' it 'til I'm gone

[Chorus]</pre>
