[Lady Sovereign]
Yeah!!
It's officially the biggest midget in the game
I dunno...
Make way for the S-O-Veeeeeeeee!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Love me or hate me, it's still an obsession
Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me then - thank you
If you hate me then - fuck you!

[Missy Elliott]
I'm ridin like a Range Rover, bitch move over
Wear mo' ice than the bears in the polar
Off my shoulders - ice, baby
Don't the jewelry look - nice, baby
I don't really give a WHAAAT
I tell 'em all they can kiss my BUTT
I got three groupies up in the CLUB
And they payin for the tab, pick it UP
I'm a lover, I don't need to fight
Give me time and I'll blow your mind
If you give me two secs to blow your mind
Yeah five plus five, yeah, I'm a dime
Yeah I got twelve cars and I'm a star, okay kay?
Them seven digits numbers that's the cash in my baaaank
I write, I sing, and I do my, do my, do my thing
I dance, romance, and Lady Sovereign tell 'em how it is

[Chorus]

[Lady Sovereign]
Stars whine, hand to the side
Came roll up like addy ap's freestride
No one got craps like mine
When I step you see that shit shine
Why not show flesh boy I'm so fresh to death
But when I wake up early early I got that dirty mornin breath
Whoops! My slap in the face again
My friend don't get offended, mm-kay?
I'm the realest girl in the game and no I ain't pretendin
Yeah I got no car but I'm a star okay?
Them seven digits numbers well umm, they're not that far away
Alright, I don't sing, but I do my thing
I don't dance, I just grin, it's the alien Sovereign

[Chorus]

[Lady Sovereign]
Love me or hate me, love me or hate me
Love me or hate me.. ah ha ha
HA!!!

[repeat 2X]
So I can't dance and I really can't sing, yeah
I can only do one thing and that's be Lady Sovereign

[Chorus] - 2X

[repeat 2X]
Love me or hate me, love me or hate me
Love me or hate me, love me or hate me...
I can only do one thing and that's be Lady Sovereign</pre>
