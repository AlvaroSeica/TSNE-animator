[Bashy]
Look, yo, no castaway, no survivor
I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
A mummy ain't said "Honey, I shrunk the kids," yet
I ain't Jesus, but I'm walkin' on water
There's no bomb here, there's no war cause
I can break out of jail with a lighter
So is there any point in making laws, blood
This ain't Atlantis, are you sure?
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore
No rain, condoms it poured and up the road
You'll never guess who I saw

[Kano]
Uh, uh, uh, it's K-A
Look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym (Yeah)
Honey, I'm home this is where I wanna live (Yeah)
Just found it like Nemo on the pillow
I don't know if it's greener, but it's green though
On the other side of the fence, bind to the ends
Look, no fence, no stress, no rent, no superficial shit, this real flow
Where the women look hot, but the beach cold
And the speech goes like, "Hi little lady"
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy
Swag up on a hundred degrees, no eighty
Look, if heaven had a VIP, uh, this is it: white sand, blue sea,
But I don't know who they are and I'm damn sure they don't know me, 
but I come in peace!

[Bash] + (Kano)
Cool! White flag! White flag!
(Uh-huh, no war!)
No guns! (No corps!)
Just life (Just love)
No hype (Just fun)
No ties (Just me and my mind)
Just me and my wife
(But tell me if I'm dreamin' 
cause I don't wanna wake up till the evenin')
And I don't wanna be left sleepin' 
from all the diseases that I breathe in
(Look, respect the island, no stealin')
And don't bring religion here, no three kings
(It's great and we ain't leavin'!
