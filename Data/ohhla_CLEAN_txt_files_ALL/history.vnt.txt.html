[Hook] {The Specials?}
"Round and round, round we go!" 
"Round and round... round and round"

[Verse 1] 
Since the day I was born, I could work for a boss
Or hand in a form, or shoplift to survive til the cops swarm
Selling my days, selling my ability to work for a wage doing whatever pays
Getting something much less than what I make and what it costs
So I guess I got robbed for the lot
The man who tried to bust and make you shirk
Getting nothing but death and doing all of the work
Get a jerk taking your calls, licking his balls
Cos his dad own the phone and the fucking four walls
Making things to sell, not things I need
And if you're sick you better get the money and bleed
If you can't pay the bills, getting repossessed
in the back, take the house - you can keep the rent
It's politics and crime, world war in demand so
everything going to plan, history of the world

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They can rob us all blind, but when I take it back it's 'crime'
I take what I need cos what's there's is mine
It's like, white supremacy, male supremacy
Kill the bullshit, know your enemy
Everyone I got has been one but a working man, not the parliament
It's been done before, get it done again
I don't want no part of what they're offering
Came to rat on your friend and mine
So if you wanted me to rock the vote - I'd rather calm my throat
Rather drop the soap than cop The Age
The history of the world from the slave to the wage - it's a class war
Something like Vinnie Jones slamming your head in a car door
ducking in Darfur
Everything that you ask for, a little matter of genocide
Step aside, a history of the world

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Spending more time with the ones I hate than the ones I love
Iron fist in a velvet glove held above 
With boredom and anger but I pay for the medicine
Everyday reproducing the hell I'm in
Life of the citizen is the life of the militant
High school death for the innocent
When the diarist(?) is unfulfilled
My dreams are repressed and replaced with a pill
Or a bottle of Red, but the boss is a good bloke
He give me break for a bite and a smoke
And the shit I make he take more than what I want to
Wonder how the motherfucker get away outnumbered
But they got police to beat me up
Prison to lock me up, military want me up
to kill folks that are just like me, far away
For the freedom to keep getting fucked everyday in the world

[Hook]
