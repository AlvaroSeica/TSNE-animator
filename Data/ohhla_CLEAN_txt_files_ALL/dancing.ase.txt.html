[Intro: D.A. Wallach]
Ooh wow wow wow-wow-wow, fuck around
{*guitar joins in*}
A&amp;E, Chester French, B-U-N-D-I-E-S

[Chorus: D.A. Wallach]
Brought your camera phone, friends left you alone
Now you're wasted and you're dancin like a white girl
Gave ya number too, bein mild rude
At every other dude cause you're a fuckin white girl

[Interlude 1: Masta Ace]
Dancin like a white girl, dancin like a white girl
Dancin like a, dancin like a, dancin like a white girl
Dancin like a white girl, dancin like a white girl
Dancin like a, dancin like a, dancin like a white girl

[Masta Ace]
Girl you need to learn how to hit the floor and burn
Cause you're tryin to do the worm and you know that dance is old (old)
Maybe I'm insane but you look like you in pain
You remind me of Elaine from that "Seinfeld" episode (sode)
I ain't bein rude, I could tell you in the mood
cause you're dancin with this dude but you steppin on his feet (feet)
You're dancin kinda fast and the song is kinda slow
What I really wanna know is do you even hear the beat?
Cause you're dancin like a, white girl

[Chorus]

[Interlude 2: Pav Bundy]
Now you're dancin like a white girl, shake it like a hula-hoop
Make your body jump around, spinnin like a Frooty Loop
You don't care, shake your hair, hands up on your derriere
Too much there now come right here and sit your ass down in that chair

[Edo G]
Them jeans are fittin tight girl, this is your night girl
You the right girl, dancin like a white girl
But it's aight girl, they ain't no stone feet
Do it how you do it, start dancin to ya own beat
Bottle after bottle, all these drinks, we just might hurl
But if we don't we'll all be dancin like some white girls
Bottle after bottle, all these drinks, we just might hurl
But if we don't we'll all be dancin like some white girls

[Interlude 1]

"Oh-we-oh-we-oh, ohhh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh, ohhh-ohh" {*4X*}

[Pav Bundy] + {D.A.}
Now lucky for you
I like the little crazy moves you do, hahaha
Jumpin around all wild, smackin my belly by mistake (Bundies!)
{Where my white girl at right now?} Ya dig?

[Pav Bundy]
Now she be dancin like a white girl, nothin like Julia Stiles
She-she pop-pop and droppin with Bookie you can see for miles
I don't mean to be a scrooge but girl you are so off, rhythm
Swingin your gone hands like Tarzan, aw damn you are so off, with 'em
With you goin off dancin like that you never gon' get nobody
Girl you better watch yo'self when you jumpin all around make sure you never hit nobody
Mama go 'head and sit yo' body down, look like you throwin karate now
But "Kung Fu Fighting" is not on so I'll just exit probably now

[Chorus]

[Interlude 2]

[D.A. Wallach]
Snap ya bra strap, snap ya bra strap
Snap ya bra strap, snap ya, snap ya bra strap
Snap ya bra strap, snap ya bra strap
Snap ya bra strap, snap ya, snap ya bra strap

[Interlude 1]

"Oh-we-oh-we-oh, ohhh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh, ohhh-ohh" {*repeat until end*}

[Outro: D.A. Wallach]
Never have I seen a problem like you
Never have I seen a problem like you
Where my white girl at now?

{*ad libs to the end*}</pre>
