[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
So I ride, I lean, I crawl
Do it better than them all
Let the road be my guide
as I glide in candy cars
underneath the moon and the stars

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, yo, my digital dash, as I mash on the gas
Don't know where I'm going fast, but I'm going there
Stop at the club, forever sure there's some hoes in there
shaking they ass, looking for players with dough to share, but that ain't me though
Before I trick on a bust-it baby, I'm outta the do'
If you are looking for saving shawty, I'm not your hero
More like a guide
I can take you where you want, would you look in my eye?
Like you supposed to, cold enough to froze ya
Talking bout that pimping you already been exposed to
Far from being sober, let's travel into space while
puffing on this Yoda, glowing like a lightsaber
Doing what the grownups do
Be grateful that this game was bestowed upon to you
cause backstabbing betrayers divide, don't listen to
cause they front, but they don't, do what I do
cause they will never ever be pimps

[Chorus]

[Devin the Dude]
Under the moon and stars I cruise in my car with you in my arms
I'm feeling good with my brews and cigars
As the sun dips down, we skip town
A nice rendezvous, I'm quite fond of you
and you're feeling me too, I mean literally
You're rubbing the nuts, you tickle the D
Let me drop the top while we puff on trees
Let the breeze blow through your weave
as you bob your head to the beat
Come on girl, take them heals off your feet
Vibe this sweet right quick {*coughs*}
You take a hit and relax
I know you had a long day, I'ma turn up the music
and you can put the phone away and we can... just chill
Come over here and grip this wood wheel

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Ay, now usually I don't boast or brag, but today different
I was Krush Grooving on these pros and they was with it
Get it, get it, get it, girl if I hit it
I'ma stretch that pussy out till you can drive a truck up in it
I'm kidding, maybe not, I'm on it like fo's and Vogues
Players with alligators and capes like matadors
Strutting like kings up on the scene, you scatter rose
petals up under a work of art like Salvador
Dali, my swag melodic
like a sandy beach, couple freaks in a cottage
Feeding fruits and grapes, work all along my body
Work hard to swipe her card, the type of broad to take me shopping
because my ego big enough to get about it, plug her socket
Fix her drape and paint her walls
Redecorate it, what a dime excavated
Dig deeper and deeper in all the right places

[Chorus]</pre>
