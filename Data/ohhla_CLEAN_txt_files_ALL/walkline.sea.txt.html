[Sean Strange]
I remember back in ninety-eight when I was a teen
Gettin high, makin paper like a copy machine
You wanna know my favorite colour then it gotta be green
You trying to get up in my head like a lobotomy team
You think I'm groggy and mean, lookin at me like I'm probably a fiend
I need to thank God that I'm clean
Too many people never made it out, and now they paid the Piper
Livin the life full of shit like a baby diaper
The 'caine made me hyper and a little evil
Robbin neighborhood drug dealers like the shit was legal
Your whole team turned into different people
My daughter will be turnin three, what a shame I didn't get to meet you
Never believed I'd be alive today, my mistake
The sky is grey, perfect time for me to fly away
I'll never die until the mission complete
For my career been punished for what I did in the street

[Chorus]
Now take a walk with me.. and I'ma give you truth
Lately feel like I should live in the booth
Now take a walk with me.. the world ain't nothin but pain
Too many years that I've been fuckin insane
Now take a walk with me.. and peep the way that I rhyme
Every line I write I'm takin my time
Now take a walk with me.. and get to know what I do
Every time I flow show and I prove, now take a walk with me

[Sean Strange]
.. and try to hear me out
When the album through then you'll know what the fuck I'm really 'bout
And I'm dedicated to gettin on
I love my fans, you know I hope that you never forget me when I'm gone
A long time I took, with every rhyme and beat
Mind unique when I'm 'round the smoke like a fire chief
Life of a creep, hear the audio version
Our music touch your heart like a cardio surgeon
Learn from the pain you've overcome, whether you're old or young
or on the corner hitchhikin with a broken thumb
Hold a gun in bed like Henry Hill
I know how empty feel and doin dirt's the type of shit that get you killed
Kneel in confession should've gone there more
Instead of trying to flip them ki's like a hardware store
Being poor kept me hungry, recordin the rhyme
Trying to make the Johnny Cash while I'm +Walking the Line+

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro]
Now take a walk with me {*4X*}
Take a walk with me</pre>
