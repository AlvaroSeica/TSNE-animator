(*talking*)
C.M.G., Rally Boys
We black by popular demand, ha-ha
That's right, the young Don
Kottonmouth, Jizno come on that's right
Get your ball on, get your ball on

[Chorus - 4x]
Ball...ball...balling

[Lil' Keke]
Where the pimps and playas mayn, that stay dubbed out
Commission rich click, we balling and thugged out
Everytime you see us, you know the love out
Platinum in the ghetto, we moving the scrubs out
Hit your block acting bad, don't play
Flossing and looking good, everyday all day
The young Don, wanted money went and got it
Now I'm on the mic, rapping and talking bout it
With Jam Down, off top it's whatever
You won't see me, unless it's chrome and leather
A certified, B-A double L-A
A ghetto superstar, before the Y2K
Been stunning since day one, if you know what I mean
Switch up to BET, I'm in front of your screen
My dog 8 Ball, get money don't stop
Keep they head turning with the ice I rock, and I'm balling

[Chorus - 4x]

[Kottonmouth]
Now we gon' rise to the top, like scutter and bubble up
And every time we drop, playa we double up
Kottonmouth polished up, and then I'm gloss
Crawl before I walk, then I'm gon' floss
Sipping on two heavy pints, of the 'noid
Coming out the showroom flo', we Rally Boys
Play makers game breakers, mayn we just some MVP's
Most valuable players, Rally and C.M.G.
From the I-4-5, we flip
The first niggaz that hit your block, in a spaceship

[Lil' Keke]
I'm with the Rally Boys, C.M.G. is what I claim
T-E-X-A-S, where we lay down the game
This is Southside, and we got chips on that
And put a fresh set of dubs, on that brand new Lac
We bring pain mayn, when we riding swangs
It's so much rocks on the piece, it's a hell of a shame what

[Jizno]
Rally and C.M.G., I-45 connect
Drop the track pass the mic, and bet that damn fools wreck
No disrespect, we simply on a mission for mills
To keep the crush up in our cup, and grip the wood grain wheels
(now how it feel), to hit them gates and houses on hills
(now how it feel), to roll them bubble eyes on stainless steel
I keep it real, and now-a-days I sho' feel good
Worldwide affiliated, and I still ball in my hood and I'm balling

[Chorus - 4x]

[Lil' Keke]
Stay strapped and fully loaded, in this balling game
Let your top down slow, cause it's a beautiful thang
No doubt I'm showing out, every chance I get
Start a fire up on the streets, with these raps I spit
I be flossing and flipping and tipping, and coming down
The youngest the thoedest the coldest, from H-Town
Nothing but coupes and dubs, when I'm up in the pad
And you speak on what you got, playa not what ya had
I tell you now, ain't nothing like the real thing baby
Rovers and Escalades, Lexus plus Mercedes
I floss that I bought that, I do what I please
And I get my grind on, cause I love this cheese
We be balling down South, for real and that's a fact
Rolling dubs and clubs, platinum and all that
I'm Lil' Keke the Don, and I got nothing but love
But you get your toss on, 'fore they call you a scrub and we balling</pre>
