[Verse One]
Call him a lobbyist, he stayed parked this is obvious
He won't leave the block his people 'gon copy this
18 wildin no cream that's sloppy shit
Meet a real nigga to tell him that's jalopy shit
Pawn moves yeah that old ass Monopoly shit
You need to play chess and kill all that cocky shit
You not hard you just on some fake Rocky shit
One day nigga 'gon smack out yo' choppers kid
Yeah we all know that lockin at watchman shit
Skinny jeans long tim's ain't poppin shit
Just real yeah gems while with stocks and shit
Stocks with no glock just hand pull them rocks and shit
They hold L's and get cream that's popular shit
Gold ghost on some +Phantom Of The Opera+ shit
Take a ill toast and shop buy more glocks and shit
Stay away from petty ass slimes who watchin shit

[Chorus]
Young boy penalties, when will you learn?
Young boy penalties, when will you learn?
Catchin young boy penalties, when will you learn? (WE TALKIN TO YOU NIGGA!)
Young boy penalties, when will you learn?
Young boy penalties, when will you learn?
Catchin young boy penalties, when will you learn? (LISTEN MAN LISTEN!)

[Verse Two]
Aiyyo! Aiyyo no morals at all, you lost shorty
Don't know which way to get on come on shorty
You should've stayed around on the real get lost shorty
Now they sendin yo' ass upstate with forty
You wouldn't listen now you just runnin in Jordan's
Frontin in the back of the buildin passin forties
You ain't just built for war, you for the ball leagues
But you rather front with them fort niggas that's corny
Never gettin money they sit yappin they jaw pieces
That's when they get broke, crack them forty four pieces
Meet you by the store for the one vision in glory
Then I'm a tear your face off it's mandatory
I ball forever through any category yo
It's like a fresh gucci mock against a maury
Catch me in the pool full of sharks I rest as surely 
The realest, fresh off the block with the porgies

[Chorus]
Young boy penalties, when will you learn?
Young boy penalties, when will you learn?
Catchin young boy penalties, when will you learn? (WE TALKIN TO YOU NIGGA!)
Young boy penalties, when will you learn?
Young boy penalties, when will you learn?
Catchin young boy penalties, when will you learn? 

[Outro]

And keep them seventy one characters out of your body too man!
