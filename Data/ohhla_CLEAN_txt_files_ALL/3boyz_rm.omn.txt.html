Song:   Amazin' (3 Boyz From Newark Street Mix)
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Uhh, motherfuckers, shit is real
Bout to set this shit off
The remix
Amazing, nine-five

Yo, I'm living life tremendous, stupendous, horrendous
Got no time to sweat other niggaz agendas
Get in that ass like diapers run with snipers
My style is back and forth like windshield wipers
Nah papi, exposed like Hard Copy
Cause your mentality's sloppy
I ain't leavin you fuckin heavin
I'm King like Stephen, vandals murderin niggaz for breathin
Big ups to Stretch and Bobbito
Got steelo, my niggaz incognito
I ain't puttin down the glock until they free Tupac
Constipation put the niggaz on lock
I be the bomb and then some, you lose and win some
Reggie Bureil assassinate the drum
Blazin L's until my rails fuckin shrivel like a raisin
I'm so fuckin amazin

(Hey yo O, make them niggaz bounce)

In nineteen eighty nine I was sixteen
In pursuit of the cream, my favorite jam was the Microphone Fiend
I was young, but like steroids I got my weight up
Late nights a nigga stayed up
Writin, perfectin the perfect technique
I used to listen to Texas Pete every week
I sacrificed a lot of shit for this hip-hop
In ninety-five yo my shit is bout to drop
I live for the streets, I swear I never change over
But yo, I still gotta get this Range Rover
Comin back on that ass like reincarnation
Murderin niggaz like Alien Nation (so what you sayin?)
Yo, I'm sayin!

(Hey yo, hit me with that third verse)

Now the third verse is twice as ill, as the first
two portions, baby abortions, no distortions
I stress niggaz out like poverty
Commit strong arm robbery, your girlfriend's slobbin me
Attention niggaz this is a threat and a promise
I put that ass on ice like Debbie Thomas
You get cut off short and abrupt for livin corrupt
I know 3 Boyz, that'll fuck you up!
So like Kurtis I'm bout to Blow
The backwards flow c'mon niggaz you gotta know
I'm the E-the-C-the-N-the-E
The-C-the-S-the-I-the-N-the-M-to the fuckin-O!</pre>
