[Chorus-Bigg Ramp]
[Who they want-2x]

I say them girl's want Anky ya dig [Who they want-2x]

I say them girl's want Will ya dig [Who they want-2x]

[Kooly]
Who they want is Lil' Shaggy
All my dog's wanna come and blow a bag hey!
I'm out that Nine, I got karats but I don't brag hey!
You really ready, it's yo boo I'm bout to tag hey!
Wait, wait, y'all don't hear me though
I'm off the hook and my click labeled Take Fo
I play the game, and I play it how it go
Ya see the stage, and I'm live on the video
Wait, wait, they be in a Trans.
They wanna know can he sing just like he dance
A hot girl won't 'cha come and take a chance
Keep poppin' Mama, bout that drama
Come and grab my hand, You back's it up
I sex's it up, you say Lil' Kool the man
How ya like it, gotta love it
Come on girl dance, keep poppin' girl
Keep poppin' girl, this is yo last chance
If you like it and you love it
Come on girl dance, come on girl dance

[Chorus]

[Twerker]
Them girl's won't Twerker the Lil' shiner
I'm off the heezy, comin' straight from Alaweezy
Representin' Take Feezy
I tear it down, you know what's happenin' with this
Now let me see ya act a clown, show me what 'cha workin' with
I got them solids in the bottom, and two at the top
So let me see ya, wobble de wobble and drop it like it's hot
You know we on the rise, you know what's happenin' with us
So don't be lookin' all suprised, if do just back it on up
I gotta have a hot girl who can show me her world
Nice shape, tight grill, long hair chris curl
Now haters, get yo boot on up
Get wild without an smile, and I'm tatted on up
Bounce Squad actin' bad, boy we bout to bust out
On shine all the time, Take Fo chain crushed out
For my hot girls let me see ya twerkin' and floss
Don't worry bout them haters
Tell them nigga's who they want!

[DJ Jubilee]
They must be talkin' bout me! [Who they want-2x]
They must be talkin' bout you! [Who they want-2x]
They must be talkin' bout him! [Who they want-2x]
They must be talkin' bout us! [Who they want-2x]
They must be talkin' bout me! [Who they want-2x]
They must be talkin' bout you! [Who they want-2x]
They must be talkin' bout him! [Who they want-2x]
They must be talkin' bout us! [Who they want-2x]

[Chorus]

[Wille Pucket]
Who they won't Lil' Will with the Tenth Ward grill
Bounce Squad on the job try'na make a mill
Since I'm makin' them ducket's they lovin' Wille Pucket
Jub set it off to trust, but look I'm out here to bust it
Non stop Doggie Hop, W.P. close shop
Give 'em what I got, I like to hit the right spot
Have 'em singin' what I got, make the pussy bop
Make yo body pop, so let me drop it like it's hot
Somebody call the Police!
Cuz I bring the heat!
Get that kat out of here!
He can't dance like me!
I'm gettin' ready, gettin' sweaty
Sex it up, till I'm deaf ridin' with Bigg Ramp
Bounce Squad bout they snap's
Million Dollar H.B. all hang with me
Ridin' Four Runner's, and Grand Pries
Lexus Jeep's, Tenth Ward the boss
Hot Boy's love to floss
Freak's we toss, pop the top
We got the cost

[Chorus]

[Anky]
They wanna villain like me
Out the S. T. P.  fool!
Anky, D double V drive way boy ya see
Look I'm crushed out right now
In the studio feel me, 
I got big face twenty's, big face hundred's
I'm sittin' on twenty's fool, I'm crushed out right now
Right now, I'm tellin' ya my phone off the heezy Chea!

[Chorus-Till the End]</pre>
