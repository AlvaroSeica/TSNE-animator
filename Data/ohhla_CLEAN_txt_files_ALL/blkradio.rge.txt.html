[Yasiin Bey]
Radio, sucka never play me
Triple shade of black that my bleach should never 'fraid me
They say he crazy, New York raised him in the 80s'
Kill the Koch administration, gangster renovation
Born in isolation-ation, +Ill Communication+-ation
Ma Bell fiber optic, presidential microscopic
Soul sonic remedy, clinic right industry
Operating in the dark, surgery your wounded heart
Come together, peel apart, peel apart, come together
Smokin on something good, prayin for something better
From out of better, never rockin for forever-eva-eva-eva-eva
Forever-eva-eva, it's still a secret
Even when you tell 'em dumb dummies
Hush money, rent receipt and drug money
They cold gutta, want gun money
The chief rocka, fuel injected, Zulu horse proper, love Boogie
Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey
Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey
Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey Bey BEY!
...Bey, Bey, Bey, Bey

Big bird flying down on a mountain pass
