[Childish Gambino]
It's Childish Gambino
Y'all know who it is, how it is, and what it do
Mr. Chess Lightning on the track, ladies and gentlemen
For those of you wondering for whom the sample is
Ah ha ha, alright
Let's do this, ih-huh

I'm the sickest Nigga ever, go and tell your ma
And I got a little liquor like a St. Bernard
Niggasz hold onto Cliffs, like Phylicia Rashad
Cause I'm always on the edge, but I don't fall off
I's a boy in the hoodie and a hat to match
And the shit bright orange like a pumpkin patch
And they call me Guy Ritchie cause I work with snatch
And I'm rich, and a guy; what y'alll think of that?
And the cops stay on me cause I'm young and black
And the boy stay crazy like a pound of crack
And I'm all that jazz like my name was Scat
College dudes like me too love my name Borat
And I like my girls thick like chocolate, fat like my wallet
I'm tellin y'all the truth like a prophet
And if Gambino on the track, you should copy it
And all y'all niggaz totin guns need to stop it

[Chorus]
I'm so focused, yeah yeah
I'm so focused, yeah yeah
We ain't scared of ya! Tell them other motherfuckers we prepared for you! Uhh, uhh
We ain't scared of ya! Tell them other motherfuckers we prepared for you! Uhh, uhh

[Truff Syrum]
Yo, yeah, yo
Before you even know how long this song lasts
You'll be reelin and feelin so flabbergasted
Like a fast pass that you can't catch, I'll leave you blasted
Lambasted like I doused you in acid
I could be takin some comedy and I'm makin that tradic
Like I spin, cause I hocus, I focus, I'm flippin it back and now it's magic
And the beat go from cool, like plan is to Janet, to damm it
Cuties cute in to inspect my Go-Go Gadget
Why? Cause I spit in split time
It's a sign of a double wear Prada I'm reachin
I'm teachin' 'em for a while that you can't deny I'm alive
So existential, my rhymes are quinessential
I'm an educated black and that's a fact I'm presidential
One riff, and I'm siftin' through niggaz lies
Got a gift to keep my eyes on the prize, you best move to the side
Cause I'm goin for the gold, I'm a stone solider
Gambino told you Jokers that I'm so, so, so focused
I'm so focused~!

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
I'm all grown up, but I'm still Childish
It's crazy to think that all them days is behind us
I remember when niggaz tried to stop us
Now them same niggaz on my dick and try to profit
This is what I asked for, it comes with the territory
This isn't a cry for help, ain't no Pinnochio story
I'm in it just for the glory - I'm in this to win it, babe
Sorry that I came home late</pre>
