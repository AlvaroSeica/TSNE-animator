It's ya boy, Ese Lil' Rob

"Veteran in the rap game, call me a veterano" --&gt; Lil' Rob
"Veteran in the rap game, call me a veterano"
"Veteran in the rap game, call me a veterano"
"Veteran in the rap game, call me a veterano"

(Verse 1)
I wear a brown bandana
Representin' brown pride, homie
Comin' from the brown side, homie
Ask around if you don't know me, know me
I'm west coastin' it
That's how I'm flowin' it
Hey, pass me the joint, you're not the only one that's smoking it
I like black rap, and I'm bump white rap too
I like for them to hear me
And say, "I like that dude
That dude got flow, where's he from?
D-I-E-G-O"
Cross the border by T-juas, where they've been
Servin' heat rocks
Bumpin' out the beatbox
Long walks from detox
Cause we don't stop til we see spots
A lot of yellow, blue and
Green dots, don't be shot
Same way when we box
Don't try to run, because my Nikes will outrun your Reebox
The barrio
The neighborhood, that's where we come from
Brought up with pride, and there ain't nothing that we run from
They say we can't
But
I know we can
Soy Chicano, Mexican-American

Repeat Hook

Chorus: Lil' Rob
I'm from the brown side
That's where I'm at
No matter where I go, I know I'm always welcomed back
To the brown side
That's where I stay
San Diego across the border by T.J.

(Verse 2)
They call us crabs in the bucket, fuck it
Used to bump it, in the bucket
Gotta do the best with, what we're stuck with
Now I bust it
And represent my city
Even (???) that my people
That are in the struggle with me
I come from a
Place where the paint bend
Flakin' off the wall
Livin' off the wall like handball, and I'm tryin' not to fall
Knockin' on the door til I knock it down, ain't nothin' gonna stop it now
Doce diez y ocho
Got it all up in the pocket, now
With more tricks
Up my sleeve
Than I need
On my temper, you can the steam from my blood
When I bleed
I smoke weed
With no seeds
Keep the swag, in your bag
I'm a spoiled California boy, don't even want a drag of that
Take it, you can have it back
Lookin' for me
You'll find me in the brown side
Kickin' back
In my habitat
Sittin' on the bench with my back against the fence
The homeboys and the heinas
That's what I represent, and I'm a

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
I've been
Microphone grippin', but can I flip it, just take a listen
And I'll rip it
And I don't
Have to lie
Just to kick it
I'm the sly
Slick and wicked, ain't got no time for little kid shit
You vatos aren't gonna do shit, never done shit, never will
Shit
Let 'em all talk, that's what it is, that's all it is
They claim their word is solid as a rock
Well homeboy, they don't know what solid is
S'hopin' to call it quits
You vatos are counterfeits
I call it as I see it, that's the boy, I'm callin' this
I don't know what the problem is
You see the same people
On the way to the top
Back down to where the bottom is
No jales, huey
There's no need to act that way
Some of these vatos are gangster, and have the right to rap that way
Shaved head, bandanas
Tatoos
And a mouthpiece
Rockin' the mic in white Nikes, a white T-shirt and some Khakis
I know you see me when I'm rollin' through the brown side
For the west, to the east, to the north, to the south side, it's brown pride
And I'm a

Repeat Chorus

[Lil' Rob]
Lil' Rob
That's right
Twelve Eighteen
From the brown side of town
Yeah
There's a brown side of town in every city, man
I see it
That's right
Little brown pride, for the brown side
Cause I'm a
