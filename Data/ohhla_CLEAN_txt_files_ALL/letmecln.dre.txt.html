[Dr. Dre]
Creepin'
Down the back street on D's
I got my glock cocked, then feelin' the breeze
But no soon as I said it
Seems I got sweated
By somebody with a tech-nine, tryin' to take mine
You wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone
Call, my homies comin' like the Gotti boys
Bodies bein' found on Greenleaf
Lay 'em with their heads cut off
Mother[{*fucker*}], I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play
Day-by-day
Rollin' in my '4 with sixteen switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clockin' all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the one and only D-R-E
From the CPT
On a ryhmin' spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top, ya trip
I let the hollow points commence to POP
POP
POP
Yeah
Cause if it don't stop
I have to put my
Ride in reverse, go back and take anothers stop
Cause I'm

[Snoop Dogg] Rollin' in my 6-4

Chorus 1:
[Singers] Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and
          Let, me ride
[Dr. Dre] Hell yeah
[Singers] Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and
          Let, me ride

[Dr. Dre]
It's just another
Day for Dre, so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists
It's just that
Gangster glare
With gangster raps
That gangster tracks
Makes a gangs of snaps, uh
word to my homies on the streets
And word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats
That I
Hit ya with
That I
Get ya with
As I groove in my four on D's
Hittin' the switches
Bitches relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumpin' Doggystyle and I'm 'bout to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic
The Reme Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smellin' like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly honies and skeezers
They wanna roll in my funky 6-4
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that
So
When I crawl, I comes correct
Now, if your hoe in my ride, it's your hoe you check
Fool
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip a nigga, trip to the south side, yeah

[Snoop Dogg] Rollin' in my 6-4
[Dr. Dre]    With all the hookers sayin'

Chorus 2:

[Dr. Dre] With all the hookers, sayin'
[Singers] Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and

[Dr. Dre] Know what I'm sayin'
[Singers] Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and
          Let, me ride

[Dr. Dre]
Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slausson
On my way to the strip
Now I'm just flossin'
Checkin' my rearview
Cause brothers, they will do
Jack moves
Black fools, cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 211
Get with Dre and get caught up in a 187
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some brothers like trippin'
But I just watch them hang
So on and so on
Why don't you let me roll on
I remember
Back in the days, when I used to have to get my stroll on
Did nobody wanna speak
Now everybody
Peeping out they window when they hear me beatin' up the street
Is it Dre?
Is it Dre?
That's what they say
Every single day in L.A.
Yo
But I ain't trippin', I'm just kickin' it
While my D's keep spinnin' and these hoes keep grinnin'
I'll be

[Snoop Dogg] Rollin' in my 6-4
