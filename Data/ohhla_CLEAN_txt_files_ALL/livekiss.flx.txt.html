[Intro: Action Bronson] (Statik Selektah Scratchin) (*Statik Selektah sample)
AHHHHHH YEAH! (A-A-A-A-A-Aiyyo I represents Queens-"Kool G. Rap")
Yeah you already know come on! You know what time it is? (A-A-A-A-Aiyyo I represents Queens-"Kool G. Rap")
Please let 'em know (A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aiyyo I represents Queens-"Kool G. Rap")
Bam Bam! We in here! Uh! Statik (*Statik Selektah!) Yeah!
(Yo I represents Queens I prop scenes up -"Kool G. Rap")

[Verse One: Action Bronson]
Yo! Yo the cops set me up tryin to play action (Nope!)
Good thing I'm like Peyton with the play action (Yo go long son!)
Goldwagon need a diaper 'cause I'm shittin on 'em
No lyin, engine like a retarded lion 
Very special (Uh!) Twist pussy like pretzels
(Uh!) The driver name Fletcher
Sit in the back of the Cadillac stretcher
Maroon dash air bloom when the platoon blast
Blue grass in the jag playin jazz
Beige leather glove on my hand 
Dad call me Bam Bam Baklava 
Sell ten out the minivan like a soccer mom
Backflip out the eight, Doctor Octagon, aqua hibachies on
Put the fork in the pasta with the shitakies on it (OH!) 
Ain't a dime gettin moved without papi on it (NO!)
Green paper motherfuckers left sloppy for it

[Chorus: Statik Selektah scratchin]
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aiyyo I represents Queens-"Kool G. Rap"
A-A-A-A-A-And you say New York City!-"Jay-Z"
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aiy-Aiy-Aiyyo I represents Queens-"Kool G. Rap"
A-A-A-A-A-And you say!-"Jay-Z"
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aiyyo I represents Queens-"Kool G. Rap"
A-A-A-A-A-And you say New York City!-"Jay-Z"
A-A-Action son!-"Havoc"
Yo I represents Queens I prop scenes up -"Kool G. Rap"

[Verse Two: Action Bronson]
Uh! Throw the left foot knock a horse out
Word came from across town I put the foot down
Threw the napkin in the dessert disgusted, licked the mustard
Kiss my cousin, motherfucker know I do my thing it's nothin
Uh! Suede patches on the elbow with a jacket
Fruit savor bags for the green crack 
Toast the sesame seeds on the sea bass
Camdy Sky Walker Adidas, sittin courtside Heat, Jazz 
Please, my bitch squeeze at 45 degrees
While I shift the V with mystique
Kiss on your cheek go to sleep
I roll the leaf up uh, come through the block with Queen Latifah
A hundred grand wrapped in a flag of Trinidad
I been a dad smoke dough got the same taste as a lemonhead
I wanna meet the bitch that invented head
Korean meets late on a lettuce bed, roll up

[Chorus: Statik Selektah scratchin]
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aiyyo I represents Queens-"Kool G. Rap"
A-A-A-A-A-And you say New York City!-"Jay-Z"
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aiy-Aiy-Aiyyo I represents Queens-"Kool G. Rap"
A-A-A-A-A-And you say!-"Jay-Z"
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aiyyo I represents Queens-"Kool G. Rap"
A-A-A-A-A-And you say New York City!-"Jay-Z"
A-A-Action son!-"Havoc"
Yo I represents Queens I prop scenes up -"Kool G. Rap"
