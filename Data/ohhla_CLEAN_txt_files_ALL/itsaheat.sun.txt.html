Song:   It's a Heat Up
Typed by: jostmatt at bluewin dot ch

The King is here, now everybody relax
I'm much greater than a dictator, so I tax
Old and new jacks for tryin to prove that
They can hold grudges, but I remove that
Grudge from your chest, but test the royal highness
You're insecure and need a blanket like Linus
My security holds impurity
I'm so confident cause I'm sure these
Words are heard throughout the atmosphere
When it's time to renew it I do it there
Where thoughts are trapped until the moment I tap
Into the wise dome and so roams the rap
Used like a tool to school a young fool
Mention competition, my mission is to ridicule
Anyone who chose to oppose the pro
Here's some tissue, go blow your nose
And yo, you need experience to be affiliated
Come closer and get cremated
As you burn it's my turn to speak
Just wait, cause everything you said is weak
It's about time to hear a brand new rhyme
The new rhyme is mine and it shines
Forever, studyin to be clever
Hook up the wires, I pull the lever
This experiment is under my consent
And any other fake brothers are irrelevant
Stand clear so you can hear the proof
L7/square, I speak the truth
Now you can go and pull the fire alarm
But stick around, I'm just gettin warm

It's a heat up

(Now that's a fire) --&gt; Eddie Murphy

You're still around, watch it get hotter
(Tu necesita fuego?) Nada
The only fire is when I then hold
A clip full of nine millimeter rhymes, then roll
On the block to rock, see a crowd flock
Synchronize, ready, start the clock
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Your whole alphabet in four seconds
Now rewind it, play it again and check it
It's correct, well what do you expect?
My mental capabilities are too high-tech
About to be another old break
That I had to heat up the mic, then I bake
Crew of MC's, change it and then freeze
To ignite the Fahrenheit, now complete degrees
360 good reasons
I take a walk through hell and start freezin
Everything in sight that I just don't like
And then watch me come back and heat up the mic

It's a heat up

(Now that's a fire)

Call out the big red trucks with the ladders
You're really sweatin a lot, what's the matter?
You can't take the heat which is a rhyme and beat
But acknowledge the heat raisin above the street
The rhyme flows like lava, I'm a volcano
You're a clogged drain and I'm Drain-O
Before you know it your'e down the drain
Check the temperature, the heat remains
Hot enough to fry an egg on the surface
I go to the extreme and you're nervous
You go to touch the mic but it melts
Hot peas and butter, I got the belt
Do I hit you, or do I let you slide?
Hm nah, face the raw hide
Feel the pain in the fire and anguish
The everlasting fire will not extinguish
A heat up

Heat 'em up, Louie

It's a heat up

(Now that's a fire)

Come, gather around the bonfire
To be immune to the heat it requires
Concentration, deep meditation
Calm cool thought activation
Take a positive rep and let the negative step
From the mind where thoughts are kept
They all ran to see the King fantasy
And every girl wanna be a girlfriend to me
From the Asia to the Mecca
The rhyme is a tool just like Black &amp; Decker
That I use to build a flame
Wild fires burn then meanwhile my name
Appears in smoke to fill the air
Another flash warning: the King is here
Panic is in the streets and on the stages
And if I look into your book I burn pages
All that's left is ash and debris
Fire department - do your duty
Blaze and amaze and daze and then scorchin
I hope that you recognize the misfortune
Of bein burned by the great old Sun
From 89.6 to 101
Temperature's risin, the heat is unbearable
When I melt the flesh it looks terrible
You need grafting, or even surgery
Though at one time you never even heard of me
Now you know and all your friends know
Exactly what time it is, so let's go
I be the one you want me to be
Before you know it I show it in a third degree
Burn, the torch that I hold burns eternal
Now I leave you all in the inferno
Heat Up

It's a heat up

(Now that's a fire)
