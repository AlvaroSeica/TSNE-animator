Hi, Horsebox coming back 2012
Spent some time in the penitentiary and stuff
Can't find my mic, yeah
People coming back they say its the encore
That was just after my first bar
All the stuff I say
All the words I ever say
All the sentences
I go back in 27 centuries and create them all into song titles
And do songs about them
Then I do the same on the sentences that are inside the song titles, man
What do you expect aliens doing with this shit?
Turn the voice up I respect it so much
(???)
I excited the internet but I never appeared on the motherfucker
Man I understand
And I even care
Disturbing lack of visions but doesn't lack disturbing visions, see
R declares war on me
I got friends that are still trapped in a time loop he made in '83
He say the R is without pride like shit or homosexual lions
And s he says it without shame
Says I can use it
I'm thinking of taxi drivers
He prolly thinking 'Taxi Driver'
But
If I put my dick in anyone's ear it's 'cos they asked me to take them somewhere new unexpectedly
Yeah
The whole internet crashes
Apocalyptic visions
And now he's not on the visionary tip
Was there not 3? son?

I got a much better internet in my head
But the medium's been tarnished at best
If you say 'telepathy' is because of me
I don't think, man, but I got the premonition that you're gonna ask me if I'm a mind-reader
I can tell cos I read your mind
I mean that's part of it
People always said there was someone else not with me
A married man
I'm not with you
The Namibians now tell me
It's because you're a telepath, see?
It's you like beermats and a drinking contest stolen from somewhere between Doom and Lemmy
And its not a gay thing
It's just not
Nor Messi, see?
I'm just not gay
Man it's better to compromise because you were forced to, what's the alternative?
What up Rip?

But
If it wasn't by Roger F you'd motherfucking like it
Indicating you're shit
Only I'm the same but to a far lesser extent
Man Skinny off to bed
Rodney P is off to bed
Adam F is off to bed
Snooks is off to bed with a sigh
Is it lack of virgins, Rog? O visions yeah
Chester P is off to get a last pint down
That's how he get down
Thinking too much about the deep shit
Mark B and Blade are off to bed
Not separately but not alone
R accepts the oracle
Shall dream of a mechanical tricycle
What's that shit
We only asked if he said he was lyrical
Did you copyright that word too, motherfucker?
I copyrighted the word copyright
Then possessed a swan, yeah
Outdrank seven thirsty Magi
Where's all the magic gone?
Now I'm back
That's at where your head's at
The mental capacity for communication beyond the norm
That's what I was trying to say in my head
Go complain to your internet pussy-you-fake-sign-in-ass-rog-hating-protocol-provider-ass-haver
Did I tell you about the one about...
No?
The internet dies I don't need it
Electricity dies I don't need it
Ever think about your 'Horse Bride Periodical' magazine
You probably think its about you
Like "its all about you
It's all about you baby"
Man she went down like her own porno website pseudonym
I get angry at stuff often about everyone being equal
Man they just not man, c'mon
In terms of alcohol tolerance let alone basic driving ability
sober its not a gender issue
Like E this is like SJP but...what I wanted to
Is that in the bible? 'Cos...oh all men are...so...
in no way are they let every or all
Excluding clones maybe twins, matching similarities yeah
Versus the American dream then equal opportunities

Bar Count
I wanna be in Bar Wars shit
What I wanna do is spit a hundred better than 'bis, is it possible?
'Cos he's not spitting at 100 bars level, yo, he knows it
Ten thousand bars...
I got more bars than J.D. Wetherspoon, yo, and you know
More bars than u gonna get in motherfucking jail
Once you hear this shit go mad and off some motherfucker yo
This is MCXP, Axis, Roger F, Horsebox
2012 he's doin some shit, man
Peace to Rob Northy, i'm outta here
Yeah</pre>
