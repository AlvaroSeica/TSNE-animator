[Chorus 2X: Gretta]
Meet me at the Truck yard (oh la-la-la-la)
I'll be waiting there, for you

[Truck]
Police making the block hot, God damn, it's slow
Been on my grind all day, ain't got no dough
Bored as hell, ain't got nowhere to go
Life's a bitch, ain't got nothing to show
Picture a non stop party that go on for days
Put your liquor by the barrel, man, pounds of haze
Bring ya latest SUV's and your decked out Hummer
Come one, come all, shit's going down this summer
Ghetto girls gone wild, ma, flashing the breasts
Got me thinking of a hood wet tee contest
With a body like that, baby girl you're blessed
Turn around, let me put that big ass to test
No lie boo, Truck's feeling you
If you come in her mouth, there's nothing else to do
I heard there's more than a batch, it's a festival
You can meet me, bring a friend or two

[Chorus 2X]

[Truck]
Meet you where, meet you what? Be in front of
Ya building at ten, I'll scoop you up
Check out mami's open, she's loving the Truck
I got one hand on the wheel, the other hand on her butt
The one night stand man, put it all in the gut
Welcome to the Truck yard, come in at your own risk
There's a lotta things in life, but not quite like this
Hotter than Summer Jam, liver than Spring Break
Middle shown ladder to make the earth quake
Come through, bring ya whole gang and we
Can get the party poppin' like Meth did up in Soul Plane
There's time's I tell you, but when will you learn
If the roof on fire, let the muthafucka burn
There's a party going on, you better get here quick
Whether you walking, riding a bike, or driving a whip
Damn, streak, smoke, or your ass get sick

[Chorus 2X]

[Truck]
Now Truck done brought all the hoes to the yard
Niggas like her ass fatter than yours
Damn, right, it's fatter than yousr
But your shake, is better than hers
Twist up the Dutch, nigga, roll up the weed
Don't worry bout no thing, man, I got what you need
You can get on FedEx at three
It's no telling where the night may lead

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
