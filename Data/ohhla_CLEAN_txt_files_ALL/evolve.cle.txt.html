[Chorus]
Changes are coming to our lives
We canEvolvet avoid them even if we try
So pay attention, we need to realize
WhatEvolves going on if weEvolvere going to survive
Were at a point in the history of time
Where we all have to put differences aside
And choose to either evolve or we could die
The choice is up to us all now to decide

[Verse One]
IEvolvem like a grade twelve whoEvolves trapped in grade two
Feeling like IEvolvem a hundred steps ahead of these fools
They only talk goo-goo-ga-ga, eating baby food
About as smart as the square root of my I.Q.
Open your eyes, itEvolves like the whole worldEvolves gone dumb
And thinks the answer to four plus four equals one
So when IEvolvem like canEvolvet you see the answer is eight
People stare at me, with a blank look on their face
And just laugh trying to make it seem like IEvolvem the weirdo
CuzEvolve their ability to think critically is zero
Just blindly accepting everything theyEvolvere told
By a system thatEvolves designed just to keep us controlled
And the time has come now, to burst your bubbles
I donEvolvet care anymore, if it gets me in trouble
When thereEvolves people dying, denialEvolves no excuse
You shouldnEvolvet turn a blind eye, once you know the truth
And when money, is the main reward
So we can buy material things others canEvolvet afford
To feel better about our self worth with more
Our mentality is dysfunctional to the core
So Remember, every single dollar you gain
Comes from the expense of another human being
Suffering, somewhere else, and whatEvolves unhealthy
Is because we donEvolvet see them, we donEvolvet feel guilty
To Selfish men who donEvolvet give a damn
Show some empathy for your fellow woman and man
Wake up, grow up and get some courage
CuzEvolve If you donEvolvet, itEvolvell be your own kids who perish
The reality is, were on a sinking ship
Just like the titanic and the icebergEvolves been hit
So while most people stand around in shock
IEvolvem trying to build some lifeboats and start paddling off
(Because)

[Chorus]
Changes are coming to our lives
We canEvolvet avoid them even if we try
So pay attention, we need to realize
WhatEvolves going on if weEvolvere going to survive
Were at a point in the history of time
Where we all have to put differences aside
And choose to either evolve or we could die
The choice is up to us all now to decide

[Verse Two]
ItEvolves like the population has become
Zombies hypnotized in a trance and numb
With no clue, a paradigm shiftEvolves begun
It ainEvolvet cool anymore to be stupid and dumb
Defining yourself off what you look like
Or your social status is not the meaning of life
Quit following the herd, like a flock of sheep
And stop being so concerned, about what other people think
CuzEvolve it ainEvolvet just my words that are scary to yEvolveall
ItEvolves the combination of intelligence with balls
While IEvolvem doing this for real, youEvolvere sitting on your couch
DonEvolvet just follow me, you need to be a leader for yourself
What happened to being a man, standing proud
Now the worldEvolves full of chickens and sell out cowards
And you know, our morality has become lost
When real heroes like Nikola Tesla are forgot
If you donEvolvet believe your freedom is under attack
Look at the NDAA and the Patriot Act
ThereEvolves millions of people that are now in prison
CuzEvolve the industry profits with the more that are in them
You probably donEvolvet even know, that oil is used
In almost every single product that we consume
And weEvolvere running out of it now rapidly
Were past the peak and with that comes catastrophe
We need to grow our own food, organically
Learn to the live off the land, start saving seeds
Prepare yourself mentally, stay ahead of the game
Because itEvolves better to be ready than a second too late
IEvolvell spell it out for you then connect the dots
ThereEvolves way too many people living under a rock
Listen IEvolvem not doing this for any fortune or fame
IEvolvem just trying to get the message out to you, before itEvolves too late
( Because )

[Chorus]
Changes are coming to our lives
We canEvolvet avoid them even if we try
So pay attention, we need to realize
WhatEvolves going on if weEvolvere going to survive
Were at a point in the history of time
Where we all have to put differences aside
And choose to either evolve or we could die
The choice is up to us all now to decide</pre>
