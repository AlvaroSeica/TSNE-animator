Ay yo Rookie, is a game that a fool plays
Im sitting here reminiscin bout my school days
Ay yo I used to go mad fresh
scoop the chick, stupid prick, get the digits and the address
yo they was jockin, cause I was clockin mad cash
I slid a chick everyday after last class
Strictly a sex thang
Let me explain
I hit 'em up, get 'em up, and put 'em on the next train
My trademark was black glasses
I cut the wack classes
Then slide off with some cutie pies with fat (hey)
Yo all the fellas was amazed
By the way I was mackin females in my school days

[Chorus: repeat 3X]
yes yes yall (here we go, here we go)

Ay yo that why it was battles everyday at lunch time
A brother battled me once it was plain wack
I played him so bad he left school and never came back
And in the lunchroom it was a Big L thing
I made so much noise that you could'nt hear the bell ring
One of us closed the do's(doors),to the top I rose
And got props when I rocked the school talent shows
My opponents got scarred fast
Thats why when they see me they do the hundred yard dash
I left MCs and they whole crew phased
Yea, thats how I did it in my school days

[Chorus]

When I first got inside high school, I wasnt known
I roamed alone but I held my own
I was a freshman, in other words a new jack
When you mentioned Big L, brothers was like "Who's that?!"
Then I made the master plan
Know I got a batch of fans
And when you mention my name now- "oh thats my man"
You see how
Its all about me now
All the girls scream ooooouuuuuhh
whenevever I freestyle
When I roll the whole crews on the scenery
So those who envy me
Cant do a thing to me
I used to move alone now my crews fat
I went from a new jack
To a new mack, thats true black
Im cuttin rappers like sufflays
I came off like toupees
Yea, thats how I did it in my school days</pre>
