[Intro: Fes Taylor]
We on that get fresh Fresh Air Fund shit nigga
I bought to start charging yall niggas for air
What up niggas

[Fes Taylor]
I'm from a city where niggas try to corner the market
And wolves run up and spark shit
I throw up W's that don't stand for that Wu-Tang shit
How you niggas blood or crip and don't gang bang shit
My hood starving, Nothing handed down from the forefathers
Central Park style doing how we call joggers
Ever since 50 and GZA got beef
The RZA try to fuck up my record label release
Thinking it's all peace like we can't eat
Nigga it's on, Beef like he can't sleep
Nightmares of the Two 4 War
I could hit a nigga from his lawn
Guns that'll shoot through the wall
No more hood passes, Access to the projects
Last time you hit the kitchen whippin' with the Pyrex
Acting like you could really harm me
The whole World think we rapping like Killarmy
Is you stupid bastards
I swear to God they won't do me like the Ruthless Bastardz
It's truth man half their album is an Illmatic
And fans asking you why you still at it
I'll peel your cap get you niggas sweet potatoes
I do this shit for dolo I don't even need your favors
Rather get a beat from Kanye or The Heat Makers
Then do your shit better then you
I know this diss record lame, You aint better then you
Before I play your shit I bump Chicken Noodle Soup
What you gone go get, Get swords to chop me
M-16's turn beef raw to chop meat
Twenty thousand copies, What you still rapping for
American Gangster, Better stick to acting dog
This aint Shaolin verse the Wu-Tang
More like George Bush verse Saddam Hussein
Hang nigga, Bang nigga

[Hook 2X: Fes Taylor]
They say Two 4 War aint nothing to fuck with
Them wolf pack niggas, Them niggas'll bust quick
Niggas want war, Them niggas is dusted

[Outro: Fes Taylor]
I guess it's the drugs getting to them niggas
Niggas been wack for a long time
Nobody don't want to step up and say it
Fuck it, I'ma start the coalition nigga
If you want to get money come fuck with us
Yeah, What's good, Uh huh</pre>
