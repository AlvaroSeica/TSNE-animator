[Intro: Free Murda (Terra Tory) {ShaCronz}]
Yeah, Free Murda, ya'll
ShaCronz, ya'll, Terra Tory, ya'll (C.C.F., nigga)
The Division, (C.O.D., nigga) Fort Greene
Uh-huh, uh-huh, little side {yeah} uh-huh, uh-huh
{Yeah, who we be?} ShaCronz, Terra Tory, Murda Free, let's go

[Free Murda]
Yo, ya'll be like Free blacken, when ya'll see him in a G wagon
Cheese stacking, burberry seats, he's macking
We crashing a whole club up
This is a Division, dare a nigga run up

[Terra Tory]
Let's pop them things, like corks, pumping 'knicks' like New York
Or we can ball to A-T-L like the Hawks
Ever seen 24's in a trunk, make them whores go and fuck
See the fifth, bet they gon' gon' duck

[ShaCronz]
Slow down, the line pat' son, we V.I.P.
Got eight bags of weed, don't need I.D.
I'mma roll up, we early, Tory, pass the dutch
Make sure you put them gats in, nigga, that's what's up

[Free Murda]
About to jump out, like what, start lighting the door up
I ain't talking bout shooting, what's writing the floor up
Damn, I've gone nuts, girls, put your hands up
Bout to hit V.I.P., where I can't pull my pants up

[Chorus: Free Murda (ShaCronz)]
Got what you want (let's go)
Yo, we got what you need (yeah, yeah)
When you see a real G., (holla at me)
Ma, roll up some weed (yeah, yeah)
Cuz we gwhat you want (let's go)
And we got what you need (yeah, yeah)
When you see a real G. (call)
ShaCronz, Terra Tory, Murda Free (let's go)

[Terra Tory]
Just came out, don't mean to floss
Turned the game out, we G's of course
We play the back of the club, it's G's of course
Whole team in Gucci, straight G's of course

[ShaCronz]
Yo, I got a little to waste, fuck a few bottles we buying the case
High as a kite, drunk, plus I'm try'nna scrape
Something, nice and thick, I need a licensed chick
With her own crib, no kids, and like to trick

[Free Murda]
I think I got what you want, standing right here
Cronz, that little chick in them Gucci Nike Air's, huh
I know you like that, you wont walk past her
Seems like a vehicle, you gots to gas her

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
