[Verse 1 - Wale]
Ladies and gentlemen (*echo*)
I ain't tryin to be politically correct
But I won't rest 'til I'm givin my respect
And my vision isn't set on the money I get
But more less the vets, I'm comin for y'all neck
I ain't ?, just feelin how you felt when you came more or less
The change is imminent
I asked Mr. West for a little bit of help
Realized us new niggaz got to get it ourself
So I dreamed of presentin myself
And the only thing I fear is I being shelved
The cocky, lobbyist for nobody
Book so many bitches should of been a Cum Laude
Fuck the camaraderie with B rate artists
I'm ballin, you niggaz is Arliss, so watch this
Always knew where the pot was
With no receivers had the pickin of a option
Tommie Frazier on the motherfuckin one or two's
Or Michael Vick if y'all bark nigga, y'all through (*echo*)

[Verse 2 - Wale]
Yeah, 25, 25, 25, can I get 30?
My side Jones is fat and my freak Jones is purdy
Why? 'Cause I Mac like (Bernie)
And she swallow everything like (Kirby)
Not Puckett but I hit it then I duck a bitch
And older women put a nigga on their Bucket List
Me against you, the movie of the year
'Cause you +Slumdog+ and I'm the +Millionaire+
Their buzz internet and mines internat-
ional, wearin that, Chanel fitted cap
I know they suck, I'm just showin you where my city at
Where fiends always on that water like a lily pad
But since Mark put a nigga on that Lily track
I had the British hoes talkin 'bout bring him back
But that's a shitty accent, you should've figured that
'Cause I've been drinkin to the point that I'm a Dizzie Ra-
scal, fix up, look sharp Joe
'Cause I'm a look that part until I'm all broke, yeah (*echo*)</pre>
