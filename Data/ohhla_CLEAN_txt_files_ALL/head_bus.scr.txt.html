Me? Who are ya? I'm Lil Jon! OKAAAY!

[Chorus]
We some head bussas, we some head bussas
We'll knock a hater out, we some head bussas
We some head bussas, we some head bussas
We'll knock a hater out, we some head bussas

[Verse One]
I made up my mind that I'm ready to strike and I'm ready to fight
Takin' out my steel killin' every fuck nigga in sight
We expite, I knew you bitches didn't wanna brawl (uh what you say?)
Bitch I'll swang on all of y'all 
I'm the beast from the east, wit the fangs on my teeth
I'll murder all of y'all bitches in the middle of the street
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like me
Straight knock yo' ass out into cap-tiv-ity
Down south, I'll ride, shoot and kill homicide
It be nothin shawty till the day that I die
We strive, on tearin heads up!
And everywhere we go we gon tear dat bitch up
We don't give a fuck about havin no click
Da A got my back and ain't takin' no shit
Excuse me shawty, get the fuck out my face
Befo' we get mad and shoot up the whole place

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I speak my mind, cause bitin my tongue hurt
Murder yo' ass wit lyrics and put yo' face on a shirt
I'm a motherfuckin rider, cause I thought y'all knew
I ain't run from nothin' even if it's twenty of you
I think it's plenty of you that really want the shawty dead
But watch what ya said lil shawty, I'm makin' bread
Fuck all y'all born haters wit the hatred blood to match
A long way but plus I run with G's and gats
And shawty matter of fact these trill G's be thugs
We ain't talkin behind yo' back and we ain't scared to bust
I'm by myself, but bein alone makes you strong
I stepped off the porch young, so shawty I been grown

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
ATL off the chain down here
Ya come wit dat yappin and no action, you gon' disappear
You walk in the club, it's tight like brass knuckles
Straight elbowin haters like we jumpin off turnbuckles
Beatin in ya door with dat clip on the tech
Beatin down ya block in that 89' Chevy
Tell that stupid boy we throwin' 'bows and we ready
Screamin' "swang shawty" to dem boys dat can't stand me
Yeah shawty - I'ma ATL slugga
Knockin' off heads on you pussy motherfuckers
Shawty be sayin', "Scrap, you a cool boy!"
But I know in my heart dat I'ma head bussa boy! (Head bussa!)
