[Intro - Classified - talking]
Uh
Yeah
Nowadays, everybody's always askin me
"Yo Class, what can I do to make it in this music game, man?"

[Chorus - Classified]
(Step 1), get your flow, come out of your shell
(Step 2), learn the game and study it well
(Step 3), go for self, not anyone else
(Step 4), if you wanna be heard (you gotta yell!)

If you wanna make it in the music business
I wrote a couple steps that you all could follow
Gather all around, sit down and listen
And when it's time to go in, kid go all out

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Uh, yeah, a lot of people be hittin me up
Tryin to get into the game and mixin it up
Like, I got a name and I'm livin it up
Don't think I'm livin it up but I guess I'm gettin my cut
(Step 1), always stay faithful
And try to bring somethin new to the table
The game's tough and the world can be hateful
Prepare yourself 'cause that hate might break you
Look, a label won't make you
Just startin off? Don't worry about sendin in your demo
Shit nowadays ain't nobody mail demos anyway
Gotta learn, value every penny saved
(Step 2), make your music timeless
'Cause that'll live on after you gone in silence
Never run out of gas like drivin a Hybrid
You in for the long haul, so mind your mileage
Now to make a record takes real talent
But after that's when you face a real challenge
That's when you see who's got the heart and the valence
And honestly, it's hard to find the right balance
You follow me? Good, now the record is done
And the pressure is on and the lessons to come
Now we separate one from the rest of the bunch
The test has begun (the test has begun)

[Chorus - Classified]
(Step 1), get your flow, come out of your shell
(Step 2), learn the game and study it well
(Step 3), go for self, not anyone else
(Step 4), and if you wanna be heard (you gotta yell!)

If you wanna make it in the music business (yeah)
I wrote a couple steps that you all could follow (ha)
Gather all around, sit down and listen (uh)
And when it's time to go in (yeah), kid go all out

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Alright team, let's huddle in it
We gotta build our own buzz, the hustle begins
I know you write rhymes but can you draw crowds?
That's the key to success, so don't get locked out
You gotta draw hype, everything is fair play
Hit the blog sites, the streets and the airplay
Avoid the negativity, any haters and low lifes
And oh right, get your live show tight
(Step 3), always step up your performance
Nothin more important than doin shows and tourin
Hit the open mics, hit your local promoters
Who are puttin on shows and need a couple local openers
Be the engineer and the manager
And the record label and the janitor
Be a pro in this whole pro-cess
The promoter, the producer and you may progress
(Step 4), and when the real work's done
You know what they say "if you build it, they will come"
The labels come callin but the tables have spun
Now you got the under hand, you can take what you want
You think sellin records, is gonna make you income?
What I make in sales, I make in three shows and then some
Remember this, anyone can sell your music
But they can't sell your live show unless you're gonna do it
You can take this for whatever it's worth, my word
But there's no guarantees it's gonna work for sure

[Chorus - Classified]
(Step 1), don't believe all the shit they say
(Step 2), the industry is a shady place
(Step 3), and everybody is out for self
(Step 4), so if you wanna be heard (you gotta yell!)

If you wanna make it in the music business (yeah)
I wrote a couple steps that you all could follow (ha)
Gather all around, sit down and listen (uh)
And when it's time to go in, kid go all out

[Outro - Sample]
It's a game, at times unrealistic
But a game all the same
Somebody wins and somebody loses
It all depends on whoever chooses
To take it most seriously (*fades out*)</pre>
