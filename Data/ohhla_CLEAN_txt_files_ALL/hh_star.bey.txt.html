[Big Boi]
Pure Playaz, Pure Playaz
Slowly as Sir Lucious step up like a new dawg
A-Towns up deuces down is the new call
You could call 1-888-Cut-Some
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna beat some
Ain't no dial tone just smile so it's a pleasure to reach
To each his own I'm stone cold aquarian freak
Humanitarian barbarian when under the sheets
It's the playa from the point and ya girl from the B

[Beyoncé]
Are, you, infatuated with me, I could end, your curiousity
If you don't think I'm too prude, here's your chance to make your move
I sit and wait on your body, people say that

[Hook]
My, MY, style, style is crazy, I, I think, think, you like it baby
Do, you, want, to get messy, I, I, dare, dare you, you, to undress me
Baby let me know if you wanna roll with a, hip hop star
Bamboo's on, pants down low, I won't stop, stop
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with a, hip hop star
I'm a rock star

[Beyoncé]
Do, I, blow, you, away, do, I, stare, you, lay
You're, mine, would, you taste, my, love
If I, take the time, I have, none to waste with you
I guess, you can't say

[Hook]

[Beyoncé]
Undress me, undress me, come
Come make me, undress me

[Big Boi]
Take off that tank top and pull off them draws
The girls all pause
Got them drippin' down they sugar walls, aw naw!
Get them to the nappy root, knockin' boots in stiletto
Damn I keep it ghetto
A cool type of fello' mellow, got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose pedal
Tuui tuui tuui, spit game
Benom to get up in 'em, let me peep pop that thing
First check her brain to she if she
sane, deranged, or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins

[Sleepy Brown]
The way I feel ooh girl I know it's got to be
Me all on you and damn girl you all over me

[Beyoncé]
Baby let me know if you wanna roll with a, hip hop star
Bamboo's on, pants down low, I won't stop, stop
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with a, hip hop star
I'm a rock star</pre>
