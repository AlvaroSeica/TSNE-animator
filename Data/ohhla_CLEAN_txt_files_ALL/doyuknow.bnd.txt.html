(Wyclef Jean)
Y'all hear the guitars
Wyclef is in the building
Puffy came to get me
I have officially made the band
I'm a rockstar

(Sara)
Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh a Duh Duh
Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh a Duh Duh
Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh a Duh Duh
Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh
Do you know where you're going to
Do you like the things
That life is showing you
What are you gonna do
Do you know

(Chopper)
So where you from?

(Babs)
Where chicks rock Air Force 1's
Belly shirts tied up and our hair stay done
So where you from

(Fred)
Where they don't rock Air Force 1's
We hit the block out the spots holding Air Force guns
So where you from

(Ness)
Philly spitters rock Dickies and boots
A deuce deuce in my tube socks inching the shoe
Man where you from

(Chopper)
Where guerillas don't be messing with cops
You catch a case
Go on the run and still hugging the block

(Babs)
So what you doing

(Chopper)
Big Ballin' money makin and flossin'
Sean Johnin' you know how we do it in New Orleans
So what you doing

(Ness)
What I'm doing, man I'm doing it big
I'm cockin it back the mack crack, crackin' your wig
Man what you doing

(Fred)
Man I'm minding my bizz I'm trying to feed my kids
I can't starve dog I need my rib
Yo what you doing

(Babs)
Shuttin' broads down believe me
On my grind all night cause your girl is greedy
whoooo

Chorus:(Sara)
Do you know where you're going to
Do you like the things
That life is showing you
What are you gonna do
Do you know

(Ness)
All I know
Somebody better have my money
If being broke is a joke
I don't find that funny

(Babs)
All I know
That chicks better respect my gangsta
I'm far from your mother
But I still will spank ya

(Chopper)
All I know
Is this project living and sh...
What could you tell me
If you ain't never been in this here

(Fred)
All I know
My flow put me through better doors
And bought two gold pedals
For that Bentley Azure, euurrrke

(Sara)
Please, don't give up, on your life
Ghetto child, it's alright, it's alright

(Dylan)
The sun will come out, tomorrow
Even though we grindin' down in the ghetto
But so we go, so we go
When the sun come out to shine
I'd be so ready for die now
Forgive me for my sins
But I still holding me nine-ah
VIP looking for another man for rob now
Just another way for escape Riker's Island

(Fred)
I'm gonna prove to these dudes
I can get me a Coupe
Without snatching you out of yours
With that steam on you, blakoww

(Chopper)
I wanna prove
I'm a superstar
My rims sitting on Shaquille O'Neals
You know who we are

(Babs)
I gonna prove it
That Babs is the best in the game
So thugs hold on tight
Like I'm snatching your chain

(Ness)
And I'm gonna prove it
To the chicks that cold shouldered me
And the record labels
That chose to look over me, ha
I ain't going back to jail
To a pack of Oodles and Noodles
In the wack of my cell
Dudes get cut in the yard
We rushing the guards
We taking over it's a riot
Gun button the Sarge
All of my homies with wheels
Waiting for in the peel
Is all the way real
We peel penintentiary steel, come on

(Sara)
Do you knoooowwww Ohhhhhhh
Do you know where you're going to
Do you like the things
That life is showing you
What are you gonna do (You gotta know)
Do you know

(Wyclef Jean)
Bad Boy, Refugee camp collabo, let's go
(Babs)
Babs from Brooklyn and I do my thing
(Chopper)
Chopper City straight out of New Orleans
(Fred)
The infamous Freddy P. from the M-I-A
(Sara)
It's Sara stokes with the Midwest Swing
(Dylan)
Dylan Dillinger doing me thing
(Ness)
E-Ness that Philly cat sticking for bling, pow
(Sara)
Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh
Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh Duh</pre>
