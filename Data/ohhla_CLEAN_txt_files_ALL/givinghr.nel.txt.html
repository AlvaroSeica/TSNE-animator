Alongside Sean-a P., yup, ay

Shawty call me on the phone, call me on the line
Tellin me that she not gon' let me go, she want me all the time
I'm gonna be giving her the grind, giving her the grind
I'm properly dealin with her body so that mine mine mine mine

[Nelly]
I just got a late text, stop and get the latex
Practice on your safe sex world
Plus shorty got a mean back, fiendin please believe that
I mean it since I seen that girl
Bowl-legged as she wanna, see them Apple Bottoms on her
And I can only wait so long
Text messages and E-mails, leavin little voicemails
You should hear her on my phone
Come ooooover - hey
Come ooooover - uh, uh
I'm doin a hundred miles an hour, shawty breakin the law
Matter fact, hang up the phone open the do'
Heyyy!

[Chorus: Sean Paul]
Cause she call me on the phone, call me on the line
Tellin me that she not gon' let me go, she want me all the time
I'm gonna be giving her the grind, giving her the grind
I'm properly dealin with her body so that mine mine mine mine
Call me on the phone, call me on the line
Tellin me that she not gon' let me go, she want me all the time
I'm gonna be giving her the grind, giving her the grind
I'm properly dealin with her body so that mine mine mine mine

[Sean Paul]
It's S.P., the girls come over easy MC
FRESH back, with the Ph.D., OBGYN
Girl! What they don't know girl I'll give you to the end
I'll be your friend, I know you're comin back again
Now wit me girl so call me cut-cut-cut it up, operating on your body
Baby you know that I got my routine, you my true queen
Make love freaky girl, you know that I be here for love
My knife well steam, my pan clean, girl oil me
Sex with money, need a sexing machine
Sean-a P. will be there 'pon the scene, open up ya spleen
They come knockin and dey see the red light rockin
They better remember that are operating

[Chorus]

[City Spud]
Yeah, hey yo shawty call me late night, lookin for that late night
Know I got that good dick, told me run them red lights
Now a nigga speedin in that four-door Porsche hot
She like "You got +Young Money+, come and make my +Bed-rock+"
I'm like "Okay mama, long as you don't let the head stop"
She like "Okay City, baby I'ma keep the head rock
I know you the man baby, you don't let that bread stop"
I'ma be your stage mama, you can be my head prop
Told her spread her legs more, bangin on that headboard
I'ma bang it harder mama, they gon' hear us next door
Sippin on that freaky, Moscato
Now I got all of her friends really wantin me, my donna{?}
