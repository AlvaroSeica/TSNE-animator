Typed by: Cno Evil

[Madam Majestic]
I got a mule, her name is Sal
Fifteen miles off the Erie Canal
Of course, Sal was my only pal
Fifteen miles off the Erie Canal
Though we could hardly pay the rent
Pockets full of presidents
Happiness never caught a cent
If you buy a happiness all the money is spent

"Freedom"

"Freedom"

"Freedom"

"Back to being.."

[Madam Majestic]
Adirondack Mountain Trail
Follow the hills to the river tail
Go to the forest, clear some out
Pinch a tent or build a house
All healthy New York residents
Prepare yourself to pay the rent
Got everything we want, no money spent
Living large cuz happiness is freedom charged

"Freedom"

[Madam Majestic]
You're tired of paying rent, that's true
Living check to check is not for you

"Freedom"

"Freedom"

"Back to being.."

[Madam Majestic]
Tired of all this mess
Then why not the will to live
Rent is what kept Tim to tee
All that I want is to be free...

"Freedom"</pre>
