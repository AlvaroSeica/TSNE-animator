Mic Check 
Feel like I'm fucking dying here mate
(Auld Reekie)

Like oh (oh) (ha-ha what)
I'm just dying in your arms tonight
(Edinburgh city cunt)
Must of been something I said
(Sons of Scotland)
Cause I'm just dying in your arms tonight
(Werd S.O. fucking S. Your all dead to me)
It must have been something I said

Werds always working he puts more work in
Thats is for certain you cunts cant touch him
You just do nothing and all say fuck him
He aint going to make it its so basic that you judge him
When you do nothing expect complain
I'm the exception accept I'm great 
An expert on tapes that expects to take
Over UK cunt till I waste away
I take X and rave yes ecstasy
And bump into any cunt standing next to me
Like get away you aint next to me
Cause you made a fucking tune get the fuck away

Like oh (oh) (What)
I'm just dying in your arms tonight
(I'm pure dead) (Fuck a rap scene)
(Its like I'm dead to you) 
Must of been something I said
(Do your own fucking thing)
Cause I'm just dying in your arms tonight
It must have been something I said
(Werd S.O.S. Auld Reekie I got you)

Pure dying with cunts see your hating me now
Either that or you love me cause I'm saying it loud
All the stuff you were thinking the time you were drinking
And got so depressed that you felt you were sinking
Fuck all the rap shit you all need practice
You cant spit you just drool like spastics
Your past it old cunts move your past it
I told you fucking twice get a life you bastards
My math shit I rap this it all adds up
I subtract all you squares your division is fucked
Aint feeling this shit or you like my touch
Well I dont care I like none of you wee fucks
I'm so far ahead I'm ahead of my time
When these cunts disappear they will be seeing me shine
If you dont like me then fuck you fine
I guess its true I'm dying in your arms tonight

Like oh (oh)
I'm just dying in your arms tonight
(Pure dead to you)
Must of been something I said
(Sons of Scotland)
Cause I'm just dying in your arms tonight
(What)
It must have been something I said

(What) Its Werd S.O.S.</pre>
