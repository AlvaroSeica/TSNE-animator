[Bizzy Bone]
Cause thugs need love as well, and thugs need love too
And thugs need love boo, whoa, whoa
Cause thugs need love as well, and thugs need love too
And thugs need love boo, whoa, whoa

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
And don't you wanna be lovin us because of what we do?
How many people in your life you know with us is true
For the millennium what we makin, makin false come true
And until the end of days no matter what you do
And don't you wanna be lovin us because of what we do?
How many people in your life you know with us is true
For the millennium what we makin, makin false come true
And until the end of days no matter what you do thugs need love too

[Bizzy Bone]
See thugs need love as well, but could you make my heart swell?
Get outta my mind before I tell
Britney and Alicia, even Brandy, that's my candy girl
Now let me welcome you into my little dandy world
Me and my man's at the club, he got a girl but I'm single
I got the song on and poppin, Bizzy Bone finna mingle
Tellin me I can feel the jingle as the slow jam play
And tellin me I can feel the tingle of this Tangueray
Shavelle my belle, how you doin baby? I'm ridin
Wanna hit it from the back, baby that's perfect timin
Side by side, you and I, would you watch my back?
I guess the fact of doin what we doin, see that's that
I say now come gimme dat, come gimme dat
come gimme dat, come gimme dat, what what?
She don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, huh
Now come gimme dat, come gimme dat
come gimme dat, come gimme dat, what what?
If you don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, slut

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
They say it's strength in numbers, and they say it's strength in loyalty
I know you had to choose one day, and I'm just glad that the boy was me
You spoil me, but somethin I couldn't get in these streets
You held me down, late night grindin out here, holdin the heat
Look at you, you my nigga boo, down to pull the trigger too
Tryin to get me to change my ways, respectin what a nigga do
Back then didn't have a clue, now we livin better
Grippin the woodgrain in the Range, all interior leather
You want that mink? No problem; diamond rings? I got'cha
Take this trey-eight revolver, don't let nobody rob ya
When you're sick I'm the doctor, you did created a monster
Every time we in the bed, I'ma break you off proper
I'ma give you what you deserve and that's the best of me
You real with me and I'm real with you, 'til the death of me
You the first when I call when I'm tryin to kick it
And if I got it, then you got it, come and get it, you dig it?

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Cause thugs need love as well, and thugs need love too
And thugs need love boo, whoa, whoa
Cause thugs need love as well, and thugs need love too
And thugs need love boo, whoa, whoa, whoa...</pre>
