Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Christbearer]
Yeah, lotta people talk about this
A lotta people talk that, but
It's about you, and what you feel...
I mean, you as a person, and us, as people
Yahmean, it ain't bout nobody else
You know, homeboys, homegirls, momma
Daddy... (Lakeesha) and I don't care what your momma say
(Lakeesha) and I don't care what your daddy say
(Lakeesha) and I don't care what your momma say

[Christbearer]
I would, give you the world, like Adam &amp; Eve
Anything you can fathom, I seige, believe
Walk a mile in the dogsled freeze
Make a city nigga countrier than Hog Head cheese
Open the door for the will, out your chair
Make you cum so long til you pull out your hair
I, wrestle with lion, in the battle with bear
Hold on, eat the peach, when the bullet appear
Why view the world, and everything in it
Make the greatest nigga seem timid (no gimmicks)
Moon beams is the limit, cop a whole Pro Bar
Lead, make your favorite team win it
I lay down my coat, so you can walk over a puddle
Run your bath with a soap bubble.. so sutle
Make your fate believe, and hope double
Niggas wouldn't give you no trouble, guzzle

[Chorus: Christbearer]
I don't care what your momma say
(Lakeesha) I don't care what your daddy say
(Lakeesha) I don't care what your momma say
(Lakeesha) I don't care what your daddy say

[Christbearer]
I will bark on the sun, and jump on a cloud
Grab the double-barrel shotgun, and dump on a crowd
Boy loves, shown about you to start, pumping it loud
You lead it to it, I can do it, Christ truck with his style
I be the, first man on Mars...
Just surviving off ya love, and a couple candy bars
The total constellation, you can dance with the stars
While the fans, just play you, when you trance with guitars
Let you see the other side of life, that you never seen
Roll this evergreen, bigger better thing, technically
It's all real, restored by the left in the jar in Smallville
Even the writing on the wall reveal
Christbearer life true and living Smallville
I stand on my hand til my ears turn red
Keep the world fed, resurrect the dead

[Chorus]

[Outro: Christbearer]
Yeah, that's real, and I don't care what your daddy say
Who is he? I mean, I'm the same, I'm the same cat
That told you, that, that, that's, that's how you get down
What? That's what she said? I don't care what your momma said
That's your momma, that ain't my momma!
Well if she did, that's cool, that's cool
Because you know why? I'mma do my thing
I'mma do my thing, regardless, I ain't worried about it
You know I ain't worried about it
Cuz I don't care what your daddy said, I don't care - what you mean?
What you mean, you don't give, yeah I don't - me neither
Cuz I don't care, I don't care, I-I told you last week
I told you that... I don't care what your momma said
What your daddy said.. I don't really care
I don't care what your momma said, what your daddy said
You know I don't really care, I don't care what your momma said
What your daddy said... I don't care... I don't, I don't
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't care!</pre>
