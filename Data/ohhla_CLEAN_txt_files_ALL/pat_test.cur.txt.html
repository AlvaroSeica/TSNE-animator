Typed by: AZ Lyrics

One day I was chillin in the crib
Rocking the PS3
Until the telephone rang
Disrupting my game
Now I reaching for the phone
Wondering who it could be
Look at the caller id
Never seen this number before
But I answered the bitch anyways
Hello
The man on the other end said good even
Is this with the franklin with whom I'm speakin
And I said yes indeed it is
Now pardon my french who the fuck is this
My name is bryce and excuse me bro
But I'm calling on behalf of the maury show
See julie jessing gave birth too a daughter
And submitted your name as the definate father
We think paternity tests are in order
If you want bro we'll fly you out tomorrow
And I said yes I'll hop in that jet
To come out there and prove my point
Cause if you know me you know no poking
Unless I got a magnum on my joint
Now I'm having sex flashback
Indestruct
I remember that night when the condom bust
Time past since then and it been about 12 months
How many months is the child
Three?
FUCK
That sound but right
First I thought that I wasn't but now I think I might
Be raising a little girl
Butterflies on the flight
Spitta welcome too the real world
Tire screechin
Plane is landing
Trying not to think about what's happenin
Checked into my hotel room
And lit a fat one
Watching cartoons but a nigga wasn't laughin
Cause my mind is elsewhere
Front desk called said the limos downstairs
Too bring me too the set where there tapin the show
Now I'm in the green room pacin the floor'
When they call me out to the stage
The woman in the crowd all look at me with hate
The men look at me with expressions that say
Damn young star hope it all go your way
Htye put pictures of me and the baby
Side by side
The crowd sighed when they
Saw how much we look alike
Even maury said we had the same eyes
Funny how one night can rearrange a whole life
Took a commercial break
And came back
An assistant dropped a folder in his lap
He pulls out a envelop and holds it up
Says these are the results
And then the crowd hushed
Suspense was building in the buildin
I hope my parents is ready for grand children
Cause I just might have one to give them
Cause if it's my baby I'm going to man up
Pilgrim
The test results are unfolded
He lowers his brow
As he looks over
Looks up grinnin
And says relax pimpin
The bitch lyin that ain't you

(BABY)
(That is not my B-A-B-Y
Not my B-A-B-Y) [x3]

BABY BABY</pre>
