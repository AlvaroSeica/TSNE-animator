Hook

From east to west we stay searching
In a horizontal motion coasting over oceans
From north to south we stay traveling
Foreigners exploring the four corners
From left to right we rule the night
Moving through ya city only guided by the streetlights
Up or down we're all around
Foreigners exploring the four corners

Marchitect Verse

I always feel like an emcee is watching me
Because I come truer than a prophecy
I'm still around like Sophocles
I slam it down like Barkley so get lost like a car key
Never been a turn key, hope to keep the pockets
Stuffed like a turkey puff a little broccoli
Hurry man you got to see the living rap oddity
Useful like a ganja leave, mess you up like ganja tea
Turntables never falling even though they're wobbly
I'm probably on the list of real anomalies
I see them angles like trigonometry
So come to my show girl and dream you got it on with me
Hi quality, high obviously
Y'all sit around like unbought property
Poppin' thee top of the bottle like Whitney and Bobby be
Yeah, my philosophy

Hook

From east to west we stay searching
In a horizontal motion coasting over oceans
From north to south we stay traveling
Foreigners exploring the four corners
From left to right we rule the night
Moving through ya city only guided by the streetlights
Up or down we're all around
Foreigners exploring the four corners

Jas Mace Verse

I put my pen to the paper don't stop until it ends
Express my mind's thoughts and watch these words transcend
I know I'm great check the size of my mane
One step from being insane I've mastered the GAME
Like Jason Taylor's engineer, emcees stand clear
I even dynamite a mic check soundman be aware
Scary emcees don't forget the message
My text will cause the same fate as Steve McNair's
I'm a Titian when I'm writing and like professional fighting
Ain't no biting allowed, 49ers turn it out
Like dirty laundry we ain't scared to get a little messy
Especially when a sucka want to test me
But I studies your style and analyzed you whole gimmick
And realized you don't really live it
If i bought your CD I'd be livid
But nowadays they dub it, man how you love that

Hook

From east to west we stay searching
In a horizontal motion coasting over oceans
From north to south we stay traveling
Foreigners exploring the four corners
From left to right we rule the night
Moving through ya city only guided by the streetlights
Up or down we're all around
Foreigners exploring the four corners
From east to west we stay searching
In a horizontal motion coasting over oceans
From north to south we stay traveling
Foreigners exploring the four corners</pre>
