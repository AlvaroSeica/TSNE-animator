[Ali Bey]
Judas did it for the money and so do these world leaders
they cheat us like George Bush at the polls
they hearts must be cold like the winds of the poles
either that or they lack soul spilling red blood for black gold
human sacrifice, make me wonder bout nine eleven
what they doin' in the heavens on that space station
and we buggin off grand theft auto
for the playstation, what you got faith in
the book of revelations, or media publication
if you ask certain people they all fabrication
congratulations, to anyone who found they life's purpose
the earth is perfect but the world is flawed
mistakes are a part of life just learn from yours
they making weapons out of germs for war
AIDS bombs straight through your front door
and I'm sure they got a cure, what they hiding it for?
I've learned greed is a whore with abcess sores
I wouldn't go in her raw, or even touch her
up in hell's kitchen trying to get a little supper
hunger pains is a mother, but whatever don't kill us make us tougher

[Hook]
why do you, want to split our world in two
people tell me true, what are you trying to do? (2x)

[Hashim Misah]
I'm out for presidents to represent me
and I ain't talking bout Bush, he got paper cause his fam is crooks
man they push more weight then Jay-Z
off the books and Dick Cheney stay in beef like P, caught in a jux
so felonious, masonic monks and I ain't talking bout Thelonious
look at the signs, study the times
to make the stock market climb the army get on the grind
punks jump up in a war get creamed like calomine
on the blocks youths slang rocks like kids in Palestine
it's all unraveling like a dutch, pal o' mine
get your shit straight, cause death spreads quicker than hate
gossip in the hood or c-i's upstate
kid it's easy to get busted down, trusting in clowns
don't trust every body cause their flesh is brown
I seen devils darker than Wes Snipes banging them pipes
sixteen heated rounds like a heavy-weight fight
taking the life of the innocent, scandalous place we livin' in
tuff love, making plans with omnipotent
cause we true soldiers, and gettin' older
I got a queen who got my back lifting the world off my shoulders
it's all about family, once you start overstanding me
they can't control us........................................
and we ain't talking g.i. joe bro' it's more like cobrah

[Virtuoso]
From the cradle to the time that your able to watch cable
my fam pray to save you my son these are the days you
oughta cherish, with faults greater than our merits
we launch assaults from which the salt of the earth could perish
mostly over which parrish or mosque you attend
why let religion tear us apart we all men
or are we the worst kind of animals?
lifeless mechanical, selfish tyrannical
like their leader, with heaters aimed for the slaughter
powerful because he has the same name as his father
both engaging, in insider trading and nepotism
they so concerned with the weapons system
when will the lesson hit them
there's only so much atmosphere around this astral sphere
so if your blasting there something will happen here
thunder claps the air, poison gas that's clear
invades our oxygen, venomous toxins in
your blood like bites from venomous moccasins
men have been talking in, riddles for too long
proving who's strong not planning to move on
we used Saddam to bruise Iran
confusion ensued to who we'd choose to bomb
conducting operas, fuck giving choppers ta'
them cats who's gats are now busting shots at ya'
they trying to topple your regime, the gestapo with the cream
got plots to cop nukes from russian mafia
by who's poll is George Bush popular?
that's not my leader cheater never would have fought for ya'
you just the lesser of two evils
who both want the first holocaust since Hitler called jews evil
why do people need biological weapons
they must wanna get in final conflict armmagedon
