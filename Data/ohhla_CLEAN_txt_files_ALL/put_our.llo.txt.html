[Intro: Lounge Lo]
Yeah, the father's crop
Back on the block with the team, my nigga

[Squeegie-O]
As I step in the door, I want all the peasents to bow to the floor
I shatter they jaw while my team show up and grab up they whore
Staten's baddest, it shouldn't be a problem at all
Swing my the hood and check my man, Yessa Yessa My Lord
These fake niggaz is thinkin' that they got it
They're scared to cross the ferry cuz the Goonies hop and run into they
pockets
The nigga with a dog house like J.V. and Elvis
The booth, meat in my socks cuz my kicks smelt it
Up to no good, homey, I wish you would
Off the topic, fuck the law, I'd free the hood if I could
But back to this shit, I punch ya fuckin' forehead
All you see is Dino embedded in ya raw skit

[Chorus: E-Rose]
You know you got a hot track when you put all our minds together
Park Hill, Jungle Nillz, we gon' shine together
We can't wait, it's either now or never
We true kings, put our crowns together, together

[Lounge Lo]
I'm the cause of the rotten apple, niggaz gon' get tackled
Catch me at the Tabernacle, yes Lord, is back at you
The Island of Staten, these niggaz is bad news
And I run with hood niggaz, I call 'em the crack dudes
Right by the buildin' we post up, I roast up
The Stones is home, no smiles and no close ups
Crawl up in the whip with piff way, this bitch say
I overheard while she was talkin' my dick sway
But now I'm on the block with Lock Boys, it's real toys
Yes my Lord, my Yessas, they pop toys
The grand finale, my style like looka here
Pop in the buildin' so you know I got Brooklyn here

[Chorus]

[E-Rose]
I battle cats with battle raps, cuttin' 'em like a battleaxe
Leavin' 'em blind, just like cataracts
These niggaz talk like they want it in my habitat
Clap a cat, rip his heart out his chest then put it back
Ill individual, lyrical in the physical
Flip an individual quicker than reciprocals
You ain't a criminal, ya smaller than a mineral
I'll melt you into liquid, put you in a pool to swim in you
It's never difficult, cuz I'm invincible
Niggaz can't see me, like I'm invisible
Rap God, biblical, end you and ya spiritual
You gon' need a miracle to put out ya material

[Chorus]

[Bklyn Pop]
Aiyo, niggaz keep lyin' about flippin' them birds
My niggaz we get it poppin, fuck spittin' in words
Cuz one shot, will leave ya ass bent on the curb
Yeah, you know ya boy Pop, yeah, his flow is disturbed
Skip town just so I could get a taste of the 'burbs
And I ain't on no player shit but might look good in them Gators, bitch
Holdin' somethin' heavy in case these niggaz decide to flip
Roll with only family, the rest of these niggaz kinda bitch
I hope these niggaz really takin' these notes
Cuz the last niggaz fronted caught a hole in his throat
He should learn about provokin' these folks
Keep a four-fifth tucked in the line of the coat, I'm dyin' to poke

[Chorus]

[General Gemz]
I am the boss of all bosses, some niggaz call me the Christ
I know that I'm nice, live an extraordinary life
I offered you life, now, it's off with ya ice
Overall, walk with knife, never walk without the hawk and the pipe
I was taught to don't talk and get bright
Motherfucker, we get off this mic, yeah, I'm more that type
Stone veteran, play the hall all night
Mister what you need, Afghan, store it in rice
I call that price, it'll be the loss of ya wife
Plus ya kids, fuck you, you know what it is
Murder one, get disgustin' with his, no discussion with his
Send a live wire to deaden the streets, I come in peace

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lounge Lo]
Yeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaah maaaaaaaaaaaaaannn
Ya deal me? E-Rose, Squeeg', Bklyn Pop, I see you
The streets pillaged and the Stone Gang is home, man
Catch me in the hood with Lock Boys, where they pop toys, my niggaz
Staten Island, this is what we do, man
Holla at ya lingerer, man
Yessa Yessa My Lord
Ya feel me? Deal me, try to steal from me
You get killed, B</pre>
