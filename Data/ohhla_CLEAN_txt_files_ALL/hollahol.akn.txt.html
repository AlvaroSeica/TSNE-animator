And T-Pain (Holla holla)
You need to quit it, ohh
Girl you need to quit it

[Akon]
So many girls outside, and I wanna go take a cruise
And I know you a sex machine and I wanna do somethin new to you
The way you roll them thighs, and your girl doin it too
If you want we can mix it up, I could set it up, she can get it too
We got plenty of dranks, plenty plenty of water
We got plenty of dank comin from Cali-uh-fornia
And we all got that bank so believe we can afford this
So stop, playin and show me what you can do
And don't be actin like that (like that) I know you wanna ride
Cause my Lamborghini doors go up and down
Now all these gorillas here, all these women here
Somebody here gon' fuck

[Chorus: Akon] + (T-Pain)
That's why I'm tryin to holla holla (holla holla) holla holla (holla holla)
Holla holla (holla holla) holla holla (holla holla)
I'm tryin to holla holla (holla holla) holla holla (holla holla)
Let me holla at you girl

[T-Pain] + (Akon)
Yeah got a big ol' truck outside, sittin on 26's
And I'm 'bout to start my ride, with about twenty bitches
And they all like girls, so they all be kissin
That's why I'm tryna put you in this, girl
While I'm in this club, gotta get my groove on
If you wanna roll with a nigga, go with a nigga try to get a move on
And I hope that you like girls, cause I wanna see you kissin
And now I'm tryna put you in my world
So don't be actin like that (like that) I know you wanna ride
Cause my Lamborghini doors go up (and down)
(Now all these gorillas here, all these women here)
Somebody here gon' fuck

[Chorus: T-Pain]
That's why I'm tryin to holla holla (holla holla) holla holla (holla holla)
Holla holla (holla holla) holla holla holla holla (holla holla)
Holla holla (holla holla) holla holla (holla holla)
Ohh let me holla at you girl

[Akon]
Ohhh, shorty, said you want a playa with money
So why you actin funny with me?
I ain't tryin to prove nothin to you
Shorty I'm tryin to do somethin to you, yeah

[T-Pain]
Shorty, uh, I'm tryin to holla holla
He just a roll of pennies, I'm a stack of dollars
I'm tryna see what you gon' do
Cause baby I'm, tryna leave here with you
Now don't be

[Akon] + (T-Pain)
Actin like that (like that) I know you wanna ride
Cause my Lamborghini (doors) go up (and down)
Now all these gorillas and, all these women here
Somebody here gon' fuck

[Chorus/Outro: T-Pain + Akon]
