[Intro]
Ha ha~!
When I was younger
I used to wonder
Like

[Frank Ocean]
If I was singing songs, just to sing the songs
Or if was singing cause, that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't, play guitar like Van Halen
Had no, secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car, to try to bus with me
But I, would say girl don't be dumb
I'm ridin shotgun
We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
Cause my dad don't clock, off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the, living room
Lookin through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or somethin
And I'ma give you chills harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

[Chorus]
And everytime somebody asked me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They said - no fair no fair that's cheatin
I say shit, oh well, oh well
And everytime a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They say - no fair, no fair that's cheatin
I say boy don't judge cause hell if you were me
You'd be singin to her
Like la da da da da
La da da da da
La da da da da

[Frank Ocean]
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past, the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holla at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be bangin that Drake in my car
I'm - +So Far Gone+
She stay blastin Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me

[Chorus]
Now everytime somebody asks me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say naw they say okay I don't believe it
I say nope I swear I never do it
And everytime a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say naw
They say who do you think you kiddin?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend

[Frank Ocean]
Now see I just don't play fair, but it's fair enough
Cause yo' girl broke my heart in, half
Now I'm singin la da, la da 'bout heartbreak
And now I'm singin la da, la da 'bout love lost
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooooooooooohoooooooohoooooooh
Ooooooooohoooooohoooooohoooooh

[Outro]
Man, I'm sayin though, like
All I write is love songs
Then I try, come to the studio I
You know what I do
Who you think I do it for huh?
Yeah, uh-huh
But you ain't listenin, ever
But if you were, might bug with it, ha ha
Yeah, all these songs for women
Songs for women
Songs for you baby
For you~!</pre>
