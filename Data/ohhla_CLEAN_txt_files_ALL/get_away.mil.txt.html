[Intro]
You know, I've been thinking about you
And I've been thinking, we should get together
But I know you have somebody, and I do too
But I got one question. Can you get away?

[Chorus]
[CM:] I've been lookin' to get away from him
[JR:] I've been lookin' to get away from her 
[CM:] Oh, we gots to find a way, babe
[JR:] I've been lookin' to get away
[C+J] Since I found you

[Verse: Christina]
Say whatever it is you need to say
Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout heading my way 
This relationship is getting crazy
Lately, lately, lately
I've, been feelin' this way from back when 
But now it's time I turned you in
Maybe now baby we can be friends
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus] (2x)
[Second Chorus - first two lines reversed]

[Bridge: Ja Rule] (2x)
Can you get away, get out tonight?
Meet me up at the club mama
Can you get away, get out tonight?
Cause I'm free baby

[Verse: Christina + Ja Rule]
[CM:] Well what about my career, my man, my life?
[JR:] Baby, I give you me, myself and I
      And if you could get near me, there'll be no more pain love
[CM:] Well come on boy and love me, love me, love me
      The more things change, I know, I know men play games 
      All I wanna know, are you the same? 
[JR:] Take a chance girl and love me, love me, love me

[JR:] I'm not ya man so I'm feelin' like a one-night stand 
      I'd be convenient for the both, I know you feel me 
[CM:] Well come on lets do this
      No thought to it, lets give our love a chance.
[JR:] Cause when ya lovin' me, kiss, hug, love with me
      I'm trying to get it where you can't get enough of me
      Baby girl, I just wanna be free
