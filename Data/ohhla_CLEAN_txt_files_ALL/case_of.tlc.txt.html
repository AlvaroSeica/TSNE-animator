I thought that I knew about 'em
Thought that they would never do me wrong
Well, well they smile in your face
When all the time they want to take your place

Them backstabbers
Same old scene that
You've seen for so long
Always want to be around you
But as jealous as they come
Well, don't want you to win that race
'Cause if you do it's gonna lessen their space
That's when I decide to say

1 - 	Goodbye, goodbye
	To all the fake people in my life
	I never wanted you around me
	So be on your way now
	You better think twice
	Before you let people in your life
	'Cause when you put down
	No one is around you
	You got a case of the fake people

I thought that I knew about 'em
The only ones that really cared for me
Oh yeah
But they shouldn't be that way
Only down as long as
You can give security
Same old scene that you've seen for so long
Always want to be around you
But as jealous as they come well
Don't want you to win that race
'Cause if you do it's gonna lessen their space
That's when I decide to say

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

You got a case of the fake people

A case of the fake people (Goodbye, goodbye)
(repeat 'till fade or CHORUS)</pre>
