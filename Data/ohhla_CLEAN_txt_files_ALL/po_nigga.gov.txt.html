[Chorus: 2Pac &amp; The Govenor]
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
And now Im headin for the fuckin pen...

[Verse 1: The Govenor]
Crazy I'm just tryna work with what'chu gave me
They claimin' I'm a criminal and they the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
And I'm lost in this drug world and headin' for my grave G
I told Sam he can fuck the war
And got a busted jaw for sayin fuck the law
And if you wonder why I'm mad check the record
What's a brotha gotta do to get respected?
Sometimes I think I'm gettin' tested
And see I cant bow down i learned the game from the best playa
That's the reason I stay stressin'
Keep a vest on your chest in case the cops are gettin' restless
I'm walkin around, ready to spread shit up
Because my life was fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck buck is the sound as I move up
Other niggaz got attention when the GOV bust, huh
They make a brotha be a killer; I used to be a dealer
but you wanted to see who's realer
Now them same motherfuckers wanna murder me
And I scream- "Lord have you ever heard of me?", right
I need scratch, so I'm doin' what I do
And don't say shit until you walked in my shoes
There was no other destiny to choose
I had nuttin' left to lose, while I'm singin' nigga blues

[Chorus: 2Pac &amp; The Govenor]
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
A nigga gotta pay the fuckin' rent

[Verse 2: The Govenor]
Poppy need brand new shoes, but what the hell can a youngsta do?
My little brothers gotta eat too
So why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
And did you ever stop to think
I'm old enough to go to war, but I ain't old enough to drink
Cops wanna hit me with the book, yo!
And they hooked on my "I Don't Give a Fuck" attitude
You Make a rules, I'm a break 'em
No matter how much you make 'em, you know that the Governor gonna break 'em
So don't you ever tempt me
I'm a fool by mine and my pockets stay lowly
To my brothers in the barrio
You're livin' worse than these niggaz in the ghetto so...
I give a fuck about your language or complexion
You got love from the niggaz in my section
You got problems with the punk police?
Don't run from the marks, get em caught on the streets
We ain't free, I'll be damned if I play the shit
for you blonde-hair, blue-eyed, caucausians ...
Down with my roaddog Rich, yo!
Fuck a snitch and a groupie-ass bitch
Until you niggas with a cellular phone, to leave your babies at home
so you can go out and bone, huh
And you wonder why we blazin' niggaz
Cause you punks havin' babies can't raise the niggaz
And they down to be fuck-ups too
Drinkin' forties of brew, and singin' your blues

[Chorus: 2Pac &amp; The Govenor]
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Now I'm headin' for the motherfuckin' pen</pre>
