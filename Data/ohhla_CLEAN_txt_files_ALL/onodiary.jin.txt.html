What, you thought that was it for Jin?
You thought I was done? Oh no!
You can't be serious
 
[Verse 1]
Aiyyo, I'm mad Free, you acting like I ain't the one
Why they keep calling me Bruce Lee's grandson?
Recognize me? The kid from 106 is back
Yo, what the fuck took you so long to get this track?
I been in the studio all along
Finished my album twice then threw away all the songs
Wasn't tryna come out with no half past shit
So I had to get it straight like half past 6
No matter what I drop, I still hear complaints
Some say I'm crossing over, some beefing cause I ain't
Man over rap, I used to catch beef with my pops
Now all he does is ask me when my album is gonna drop
I'm trapped in like catch-22
Cause I want respect but wanna bling like Cash Money too
I'm starting fires with the pen
You think you know but you have no idea, it's the diary of Jin (Come again)
 
(Oh no!) Make sure you know that Jin's the name
Only chinese kid in the game
(Oh no!) Cause when I spit, I flip the script
And it will never be the same
(Oh no!) You must be twisted in the brain
If you thinking that I'm lame
(Oh no!) I'm putting these rappers to shame
And now the industry is saying...
 
[Verse 2]
Even my standards got higher, I used to settle for head
Now I walk through Chinatown like a ghetto celeb
It's like a bro-fessor teachng the same lesson
Different broads but always the same question
"Wassup with Double R? The Lox be bringing drama
Tell DMX I want to be his baby mama
Ain't you suppose to be in Fast &amp; Furious 2"
Yeah I am, hold up, that ass is serious boo
See that's wassup, now I'm tryna dig her out
Gas her up and let her think she got me figured out
Soon as I skip in the room, chicks quick to assume
That all I'm tryna do is stick my dick in they womb
I'm on the search for the baddest in the city
When I find her, I'ma trade it all like Fabolous and Diddy (Girl, I'd trade it all)
But until then, I'll never trick and that's it
Aight I'm lying, maybe just a little bit (Psyche)
 
(Oh no!) First she wanna talk about him
Then you wanna ask for me
(Oh no!) Just cause you got some nice tities
You think you getting in for free
(Oh no!) Finding out your girl's a ho
Am I really the one to blame
(Oh no!) Sitting in the back of flicks
While she giving me brains
 
[Verse 3]
I spit for B-Boy pop lockin, haters cock blocking
Mad cause they album's not dropping
It's the off quarter, wide out with a option
You throw it out of bounds hoping that the clock stoppng
The word is out, you heard about the kid through word of mouth
Alot of heads in the industry, it scurred 'em out
I'm every A&amp;R's nightmare, yeah he could freestyle
But can he write? Yeah, this verse right here
Can't wait to see my cd in the charts
Now that I think about it, getting signed is the easiest part
The industry is shady, alot of bullshit is in here
Hell naw, I won't pay to get my shit on the air
Lose your hunger, be the one that they leave in the dish
That's why I spit like contract don't even exist
Believe in the hype, see I'm squeazing the mic
That's why they like "Jesus Christ, he is nice"
 
(Oh no!) I'm the new kid on the block
And you thinking that I ain't hot
(Oh no!) Now you hoping when I drop
That my album's gonna flop
(Oh no!) This kid can only freestyle
He ain't really gonna last
(Oh no!) Don't think cause I'm getting cash
That I still won't rip yo ass
 
No, oh no!</pre>
