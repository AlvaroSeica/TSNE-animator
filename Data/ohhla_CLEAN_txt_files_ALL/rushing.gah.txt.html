[Intro: Long Axe]
Attention, General Kwon
Yeah I know why man, It's that Bolo Gah joint right here man
Bolo's Kitchen, That's where it's at
Pay attention yall, Yeah, It's General Kwon
Black Lotus, All my soldiers where you at?

[Long Axe]
I live outside of the torture inside of a fortress
Fast money don't last my accounting is a tortoise
But my supports send their campaign funds
Between champaign wishes and my dishes aint done
Daddy's got magnums, Babies want guns
Live in the waters with the Kool-Aid tongue
I brung, Enough throw down to go round the world twice
Hooks is bad for your teeth like chewin on ice
So I crunch on punch lines, Munch on hunch rhymes
You knowin all my metaphors and dinning on my lines
You was a riot, Now you quiet like a library
Look alive, Should of died at the cemetery
I know the potion if the notion is clean
I'm bout to cut your image off like an envelope screen
I'm a problem, Check D at the bottom, All of the above
And if you know me nigga show me some love, What

[Chorus: Sample scratched with Long Axe ad-libs]
Ya all can't ball, Ya all can't ball
Dropped the motor Axe
Ya all can't ball, Ya all can't ball
Let's show em, Huh
Ya all can't ball, Ya all can't ball
Dropped the motor Axe
Ya all can't ball, Ya all can't ball
Let's show em, Uhh
Man ya all can't ball

[Long Axe]
Yo, The beats like a dream underneath these feet
In a week got a fiend up above we can see it
All peek and it's green, Underground gravy
Check my mic level, So simmering savory
Over chips over shoulder, Keep the right balance
Life aint hard it's one big challenge
So the key to me, Throw the beat to me
A palace in the clouds now no defeatin me
Rushing attack, Black doors slam the back down
Escape apartments but never put the axe down
Hold me up above stress, Yep show me love
Time is money, Leave you froze like a photo of
Black Lotus wrote it up and guaranteed it
Under the influence of funk we stay weeded
I'm a problem, Check D at the bottom, All of the above
And if you know us nigga show us some love, What

[Chorus until fade w/o ad-libs]</pre>
