huh-huh yo its the D, O double R

I said yeah buddy
rollin like a big shot 
chevy tuned up 
like a nascar pitstop
fresh paint job 
fresh inside 
is the outside 
frame and the trunk wild 
are the rims big
do it ride good 
lean back right 
hand on the pinewood

chorus X2

cream on the inside, clean on the outside
cream on the inside, clean on the outside 
cream on the inside, clean on the outside
ice, ice cream, ice, ice, ice cream paint job

woooo!!! 
clean on the outside 
cream on the inside
ice cream paint job (paint job)
I got screens on the dash watchin saved by the bell
got a house by the bayside (bayside)
ya I'm livin like that 
and ride like that (like that)
boy I ride like that 
and the steerin wheel wood 
like a baseball bat 
just like archie  said we ready 
whole clik straight
lunatics like Nelly
gran marquis paint job grape jelly 
r triple bc big black box chevy
crank my car she be hummin 
rims so big you can see me coming 
pime time clik we get money 
stay iced up like TV Johnny

(chorus)

I'm loud (I'm loud)
like a superbowl kickoff
my slab gotta lot of niggaz pissed off
yeah paint shine like lip gloss 
cadillac got a wide body like rick ross
took time but my cash got right if I want it
I'm gonna buy it aint got to ask no price 
rearview mirror, jumbo dice, trunk hit hard like kimbo slice
Be around tint no window light 
car ride smooth
so the rims are white
that right there see see I like
got the top notch slab 
for the dirt cheap price
press one button called automatic start 
stand to close car alarm might bark like what? ARGH, ARGH
like you go prime time click 
make it move like U-Haul

(chorus)
        
I ride with a towel cuz the candy paint wet
rims on the ride got these niggaz upset
rims sittin high so I ride upset
6 12's in the trunk 4 screen's in the deck (repeat)

I ride, I ride, I ride
I ride, I ride, I ride
lets ride, lets ride
I ride, propped up
I ride, propped up
I ride, say bro
lets ride, lets ride

I gotta fresh paint job fresh inside is the outside 
frame and the trunk wild are the rims big
do it ride good lean back right hand on the pinewood
