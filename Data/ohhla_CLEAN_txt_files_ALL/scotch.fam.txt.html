Song:   Scotch &amp; Armaretta
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Hook 2X: Molly-Q]
I take the Scotch with the Amaretto, put it in the cup
I take the Henny with the Alize, and shake it all up

[Chorus: Molly-Q &amp; Lounge Lo (Ellie)]
Scotch with the Amaretto, let me see you shake it up
(Henny with the Alize, Thug Passion, shake it up)
Pussy on the dance floor, all night, shake it up
(Grind that ass, boy, dance, nigga, shake it up)

[Lounge Lo]
The best part of making up, bitch, when we breaking up
After the club, pussy home, I'mma tear it up
Came in fired up, doorag tied up
Ice on the wrist, and neck, we gon' shine it up
Cash, we gon' line it up, ass, we gon' wine it up
Packed in the Tunnel, Flex, we gon' grind it up
Doctor, give me something I can taste
I said doctor, drinkin' Henny by the case

[Ellie]
The best part of making, nigga, when we breaking up

[Chorus]

[Lounge Lo]
I was told life was tough shit, so I just chewed harder
Alpo, son, I want money like Shawn Carter
Jewels like the kind that resells, sells like Jordan and Jackson
Britney and Braxton, write my own my shit when it's time for some action
Less hands in on the cash, the bigger the Benz
Bigger the stones in the watch, the sweeter that Scotch
With the Arm', I taught the monkey jump
To the big dogs who peed on me, let's get the jump
Jumped off, put the record on and shut up
I'm a rapper, I tear ya best M.C.'s up
I said "deh-duh-deh-duh-deh-duh-doctor"

[Chorus]

[Molly-Q] (Ellie)
You want come around (and smoke some bud) acting up, outside the club
(Shake the hips, and make it rough) When it's hard, I make 'em cum
(Want Wu Product?) I get around, ya hear the sound, ya'll getting down
Pound for pound, or round for round, town to town, we hug around
Coast with Ghost, wanna roll the most? (East to West, wanna bounce the best)
North to South, just open ya mouth, Beneen, Beneen
I said Molly (He be smoking all the trees)
I said Molly (He said his team's Wyld Beneen)
I said Molly (He be smoking all the trees)
I said Molly (He said his team's Wyld Beneen)</pre>
