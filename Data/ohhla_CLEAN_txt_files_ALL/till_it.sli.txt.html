Typed by: AZ Lyrics

But a nasty man
But a nasty man but a nasty man
But a nasty you know, oh oh no

But a nasty man no
But a nasty man but a nasty man
But a nasty man you know, oh whoa no

Pussy till that shit gets wet
The type of a pussy that a man will not forget
Pussy till that shit gets wet
The type of a pussy that a man will not forget they want to say now

Little woman, you tell me that you're straight from the heart
Me don't want no woman that will tear mine apart
Me no want a woman comin' up telling what she say
The only reason why she's givin' it up today

Yes the nasty man boy, he is a rude boy boy
Me not saying what you doin boy
Yes the nasty man boy, he is a rude boy boy
Me not saying what you doin boy</pre>
