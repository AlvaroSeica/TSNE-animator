[Intro: Infamous Mr. Savage]
Heh... yeah... Soul Kid's in effect
Ya'll niggas better watch ya'll step
Word... you know

[Chorus 4X: Infamous Mr. Savage &amp; Blakspik (Method Man sample)]
Step back, check ya self, punk, you don't know me
(You don't know me, and you don't know my style)

[Infamous Mr. Savage]
I bust raps the best, busting M.C.'s test for status
With the apparatus, hold the mic, I'm the baddest
You never had this, my style gets deeper by the fathom
The ill lyrics I hazard, you try to step, you catch a spazm
You wanna get biz, we can get busy with the lyrics
One time, I kick a rhyme and haunt that ass like I'm scary
I'm fast to, sacrifice an M.C. as a ritual
When I get lyrical, I'm taking battles to the physical
The woodsman, pick pock', Infamous, you lost bro
Fuck a gun brawl, I'm shootin' niggas with my crossbow
Let the force flow, bullseye, I hit the target
The best ya'll try to test, so now you rest dearly departed
Started, beef, you want beef, kid you got it
Cuz I rock the topics that defy all your logic
What's my name? Not the fucking dog, but I'm the comet
Bring your fucking click, then watch the Bronx Bomber bomb it
With phonics, competition shouldn't even bother
Act like you roll and end up dead like Jordan's father

[Chorus 4X]

[Blakspik]
Well here comes the Blakspik, or Vietnam slum dwellar
Ready to wreck shop or blow up the spot
The black grim reaper, who, can keep a, nine
Below the waist line, hitting like a beeper
Focus ya thoughts on this new type of grammar
I'm spittin', I drop 'nuff shit like a pigeon
Lay down sounds like cement, and if you got beef
I'm breaking skulls and bones and knocking out teeth
I got a great knuckle game, you wanna play, pop?
One shot to the nose, and watch your brain explode
Pop clips when I trip like Noriega
Get ill when I chill, throw grenades inside bodegas
Causing chaos is my main goal in life
I'm Puerto Rican so don't fuck with my beans and rice
And outcasts who don't care about morality
A ghetto dwellar with a criminal mentality
I see a herb take a bat to his cranium
Laying on the floor, drink the blood up with a crazy straw
Serial killer with no thriller than Michael Jackson
Get my gats in when I do the waxing
So step up and get your jaw tapped for fronting
Niggas wanna rally but they're all about nothing
So step back, before I whip that ass like Toby
Back the fuck up, cuz you don't know me

[Chorus 4X]

[Blakspik] (Infamous Mr. Savage)
Yo Mr. Infamous, there's an intruder in the cypher
(Where he at? Go gets the gats, I'm getting my axe)
I got my slug vest cuz it's gonna be a bloodfest
Joakim keep it's real, so taste the blue steele
(Right across your dome, got arrows dipped in chrome
Phone home, infiltrate mind zone, you get blown)
Thirty two degrees frozen, stuck in the north
Your physical form rotten, thought I forgotten?
(Your underhanded schemes to break up the team
But my click be tight like virgins, know what I mean?)
Ya'll cool be in, try to front it off like you nubian
My infrared spots your globe, so shots can flow
(Dots and holes, left in your bodies from crossbows
And shotties, don't get cocky, just watch me as I cock thee
Crossbow or four-fifth back, nice and slowly
Now back the fuck up, cuz you don't know me)

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: Infamous Mr. Savage (Blakspik)]
Word... peace to the whole Soul Kid Klik
(Yeah I wanna say wassup to the whole Vietnam Posse)
G-Clef Da Mad Komposa, Goodfella Mike G., Skinslaya skill
(My brothers up in Elk... niggas up in Castle Hill, youknowhatimsaying?
All them people that did what they did just to do, I'm doing it now)
Storm Da Ghetto Mutant... Spinbad... peace to Sleepy Hollow click
(Soul Kid Klik's in effect, peace to by brother for real, my cousin Lord
Everybody better watch they step (yo Boo we gonna get you out of there kid)
Soul Kid coming through, ya'll niggas don't know, ya'll better learn, word...</pre>
