Kings and queens out there in the struggle
It's universal, talented tenth
Here we go, check it

Now, excuse me, while I kiss the sky
Bob and weave through this haze still tryin to get by
Not a +BlackStar+ but I spit a +Re:Definition+
Bring it to the front while they polly with the system
Tryin to be, conscious, when it was cool to do
Now, they bang it out, cause it's so cool to do
Can't look me in the eye, cause it's so cruel to you
Shoulda stayed yourself, instead of a fool to truth
But we still the torch bearers, let the message shine through
Universal is my nation, here's your standin ovation
Netherlands, to Japan, to my peoples in France
Zulu brass in every city each one if you wit me
Teach another if you wit us, push ahead of the fuss
Peace, knowledge, unity, for the future and the baby
Livin in this cold world, just open your hands
Break with top camp {?} anything to advance
Look beyond they situation, see the power within
Show 'em not, just a way out, a way they can win
Set the spark in they mind and the wheels in motion
Don't be a drop in the bucket when they need a ocean</pre>
