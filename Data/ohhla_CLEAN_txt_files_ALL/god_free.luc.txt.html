Song:   God (Freestyle) *
Typed by: Wammy Giveaway

* Freestyle of "I'm God" by Lil' B

[Lucky Luciano (Clams Casino in background)]
Freestyle, bitch ("How did you know")
Ya boy be sayin', "They freestyle, but they be writin'" ("It's what I always wanted")
I ain't writin', I'm recitin' ("Could never have had too many of these")
I'm shinin' like lightnin'
And nobody comin' tighter on the mic, I'm liver
Know what I'm sayin' ("Will you, quit kicking me under the table")
Say some shit like that and get paper and dough
Really, though ("I'm trying, will somebody make her")
I'm a professional, don't try this at home ("Shut up about it")
Hold up ("Can we settle down please" --&gt; Imogen Heap)
Lucky

(Main Verse)
I ain't settle down for shit
Still a damn pimp
Got rich as fuck
Talkin' all this shit
Hopped up in the whip
Drove it to the top
Now I'm looking down on them, man I make 'em drop
Leave that ass dead, flat line, man, they're gone
Man, I got mine, now I'm sittin' on the chrome
With a big brick home
Man, I'm the one
Lucky Luciano winnin', got his bank funds
Y'all was playing games
I was 'bout my change
I was dropping all kind of fuckin' mixtapes
Building my clientelle, you know that I was sellin'
Now I'm gettin' paid, I ain't gotta be a felon
Ain't sellin' dope, I'm just, showin' hope
I'm givin' kids the game, how to, what, climb the ropes
And go get ya chips
Go hit ya lick
Stay up on your grind, you could live like this
I'm the shit
Man
I love this shit
I'm a break 'em boys off and pop bub to this, here
Man, I'm gone
Ridin' on chrome
I break 'em boys off, all night to the dome, I could flow
I could go wreck the instrumental
Me and that boy Tumbleweed up in the limo
Man, I ain't got no damn chaffeur
Man, I ain't sober
Rollin' range rover, you know I'm thankin' throw-der
Got a tatted up shoulder and it says "Playamade"
Playamade Mexican, that's who I am to the grave
Man, I'm stayin' paid
I walked up on stage
I told 'em, "My name Lucky, here I am, now get me paid"
Man
And I never ever quit
I never look back
I was all about my chips
I was all about my cash
I showed my naked ass
Grabbed the mic and wrecked it fast, now I get my moneybags
Man
Got my big catalog
Every month, my check is just gettin' mighty tall
Man, it's lookin' hefty, my pocket's lookin' lumpy
It's that boy Luck, bet ya baby mama love me
Wanna take a picture, she beggin' me to stick her
But I'm 'bout my money, and I'm tryin' to get me richer
So if she can't, get me rich
I can't give that hoe no dick
I'm a be a fuckin' pimp
Til I'm fuckin' Pimp C's bitch
Nigga
It's Lucky Lu, I'm 'bout my figure
Fuckin' mob figure
You know I got richer
Suck a rich nigga dick
I'm 'bout my figures, bitch
I got to hit a lick
I ain't gotta push a brick
I talk a lot of shit
Up on the microphone
That's what I gotta do to go, get my fuckin' dough
And I ain't gon' quit, no
I'm gon' get more, dough
I'm gon' stay in polo
I'm gon' stay solo
I don't need no friends, I don't need nobody, nope
All I give a fuck 'bout, my family and my, fucking dope
So if I don't know ya
Then uh, bye bye
Cause I'm gon' be, over here
Stayin' hella fly
Flier than a pelican
Playamade Mexican
Sippin' on my medicine
Man, just let him in
Let him in the game
Let him to the top
Here I am, I remain to wreck shop
I said, "Sell on the yatch"
Bought a B-12 drop
Now I'm headed for the top
And I make ya body rock
I, make your body shake
Been this player since first grade
And you know I'm player made
And you know I'm stayin' paid
Tailor made wardrobe, man, I'm throwed
Hoppin' like a toad
Starched and iron clothes
Man, I'm so groovy
Bought another uzi
Have you seen my movie
I got in a jacuzzi
With a groupie in it
Man, I'm still pimpin', gettin' head
Like Bill Clinton, all I want is a meal ticket
Buy another crib
Buy another car
Man, I'm livin' large
Sippin' on a bar
Livin' like a star
Man, here I are
I don't give a fuck
Got my swishas in a jar
Got the damn doughty rolled up
You know I'm pourin' up
Got the game sewed up
They ain't fuckin' with the Luck
Hell naw...</pre>
