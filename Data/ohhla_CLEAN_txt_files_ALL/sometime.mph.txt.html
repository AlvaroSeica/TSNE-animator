[Chorus: Muph]
And sometimes you feel no worth and
Sometimes you feel like dirt and
Sometimes things don't work and
Sometimes you bottle up the hurt and
Sometimes I get lost on the Earth and
Sometimes I wanna give up the search
And sometimes depression makes you berserk
Sometimes you've got to put yourself first

[Muph]
And sometimes there's no sign of sunshine
Twist the blinds, give up on the summertime
Underline the way they undermine
And I'm now caught with depressive thoughts
Expressive through talk, chalk-like edges
And sometimes I don't wanna make the effort
Maybe I wanna feel neglected
Protected by the security of secrecy
Obscurely they believed in me
But maybe it was better as a dream for me
And seemingly we all face the sorrows
Hoping for a better tomorrow
And on we go after we pick up the pieces
Needless to say we'll be back again another day
In another way, I guess it'll be ok
But sometimes it's not, stuck in this one spot
A one stop to depression
Through the eyes of my sister I'm learning the lessons
Hoping that she's stepping in a positive direction
And some questions are never answered and some aren't even asked
Help me escape and take the best path
A fresh start to get where I belong
But maybe I'm here already upon on these songs
Or maybe I fucked it up and it's all wrong
Maybe I should stay strong when it feels wrong
When it feels wrong, stay strong
Stay strong, stay strong

[Chorus]

[Bias B]
Sometimes I find I'm in this frame of mind
Wish I could rewind my life and try a second time
Look in the mirror, all the happiness was left behind
Deal with this stress of mine
Will I ever find a place to escape? The way I feel inside
I realised nothing changes if I shield my eyes
From the everyday drama that lurks around each corner
Time moves faster and the karma sorta
Follows me round, I'm feeling down on my luck
When life sucks and I can't remove this frown, it's stuck
And now it's up to me to make a change
Thought I'd take the pain, maybe place the blame
On somebody else, but I'm not asking for nobody's help
A lack of love is felt, and so I'm out for self
And sometimes I'm so alone feeling hollow
Sometimes don't wanna see the sun shine tomorrow
And I begin to follow the wrong path
It's a long dark road and as I start
To retrace my steps from the place where I came
To make the same mistakes and then complain
To the world, I don't deserve this
I'm feeling worthless, I'm feeling worthless
Do I deserve this? Do I deserve this? Do I deserve this?

[Chorus]

[Muph]
That empty space, I need to fill it
How long will it take to just kill it?
That feeling that I'm dealing with
Stealing this gift with a swift nick and every so quick
I slip from that click of what felt right
And the time continues to tick on my life
On the side I felt content, I felt it when
Things were on a roll, I'm tryin to hold onto my soul
And tolls will be paid
A refreshing spray today, depression walks away
The roller-coaster, ups and downs
Some laughs and frowns and many times I've found
Myself seeking for some help
Believing in what I've felt
And sometimes we're dealt the wrong cards
And sometimes people with the easiest lives think it's too hard
Too far to go, I don't think so
Just need to take it slow, there's a lot that I know
And a lot that I don't and a few things are for sure
But surely I know just a little bit more
I've got a lot to explore, even more to ignore
But what I really want to know is what am I here for
Lot to explore, even more to ignore
But what I want to know is what am I really here for

[Chorus]

[Bias B]
Sometimes I'm feeling kind of hopeless
Sometimes I see I'm losing focus when
Sometimes I wish I had someone to hold me and
Sometimes wish someone had've told me that
Sometimes you're gonna lose your path
Sometimes they're gonna break your heart and
Sometimes you're gonna pay the price and
Sometimes you wonder why you live this life</pre>
