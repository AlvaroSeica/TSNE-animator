[Bugsy]
I know these bitches wanna fuck as back as we do
So you gotta keep it real trick

[Bugsy]
Alright feel this, lay back in Cal state
That steel grip, incase someone trip can't hesitate
Let me break it down while I bother with these hoes
When I'm in the club homie pack the snub nose
They get out their clothes, I spit the game cold
Fuck the same hoes, ese I got some new ones
Contact the dukes, I'm gangster for life
Motherfuckers wanna step they might lose their lives
I know you ain't tripping, it's a Brown thing ese
Hitting switches, straight clowning
Come on ma, shake that, hit it while I lay back
For real bitch, wait up, let me see what you're made of

[Chorus x2]
Get down, come on bitches
Right now, get down
And show me how
How bad you want this motherfucking dick

[Conejo]
Jaw breaker jaw breaker, dog I'm on the edge
It's getting kind of messy so they called the feds
To wake the spirits, gun fights and all
Ese dropped out of school to put my name on the wall
Not for sale homie, it's just a promo copy
Bitch you don't know my kind cuz your style's too sloppy
Who am I? I'm just Conejo from Los
Ese killer from the West that'll bury your bones

[Bugsy]
Yeah you know, it's all about that dough
West Coast players in this canton
Hit a switch and drop it low
This is Tattoo Ink, these vatos got the game wrong
We can all ball player, just watch who you hate on

[Chorus x2]

[Conejo]
Damn bitches, there best to be no snitches
Cuz the calles get viscious, I'll be digging your ditches
Fuck your weed, homie I'm here for the speed
You fucking mayateros, your personas so weak
It's not a dream that I be pinching your pockets
Got the .45 cal loco spitting them rockets
Now now, settle down you clowns
The Ink be the baddest, we're the shit in your town
What you think, that I won't put a slug in your beam
Your entire fucking crew straight stayed on the scene
I'll do it high, liquid acid and thai
I liquidate your stash and bankroll my supply
As for the rest, you OG's ain't young
Don't get in my path cuz I ain't playing with guns
The Devil's playground is where I met my dogs
Dog fuck these bitches, dope fiends got blown

[Chorus x2]</pre>
