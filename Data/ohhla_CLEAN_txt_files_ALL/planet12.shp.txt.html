Power surge, infinite annihilation on the verge
Are we ready to emerge? Serve! As a catalyst between
Man, alien and Pelaidian, we open the gates of Stonehenge
Translated equations, through hieroglyphics,
Learning to communicate, through mathematics
Self distruction is self evident, the President
Of this New World Order
Miles locked deep within my retina, reserve my energy
in all 5 points of chakra effect the Sun-Ra
Sun God, created for, sunrise
Living in this green house effect, I've had it up to my neck
Preparing for this next epidemic. Man made plaques, first came AIDS
Now persistent with existence, living self sufficent, efficient with my time
No time, to relax! Flashbacks, synaps!
Relapse! Waiting for the stars to collapse!

More problems to worry about!
We must divert the Armeggedon rock from Earth!

Mas problemas desrtso box se probas eh alert se distreso to mundo super impato

Crash course, destination planet Earth, dateline 99
The propaganda of an astrological find
Origin unknown, a quarter century, estimated impact time
A threat to mankind a meterological fall of fallen gas forms
that leave the planet surface area torn
astrophysisist scorn the fair warning
A problem a thousand times the strength of global warming
A thousand times the size of the great Collasase
Meet Mother Nature's extermination process
As it tosses, debris crushes cities, like brim stones
Thrown by ancient Greek dieties
No bomb shelter, can help ya, from avoiding this armeggedon phenomenom
From the Grand Canyon to the Amazon
No longer an ecological system to live upon
With life reverting to dinosaurs, courtesy, of Haile's Comet

As fire spreads throughout the Earth, melting the polar caps
The dinosaurs hatch, a new breed of hero Mothera and Monster Zero react
Nuclear experiments make them stronger than the last
The plan is to get them together unify as one
Feed off the energy conducted from the Sun
Enormously ferocious, preventing this disaster
Comes Nocturna???? and king Cobra never missing in the action
It's closer, a couple minutes away,
High voltage, energy of lazer rays
Witness the rebirth of the prehistoric age
It all started with the melting of the ice scapes
It's logical, biological, pray for the angels that are audible
Defend the Empire, no questions, no remarks
We stomp through the states leaving massive landmarks.
(meteors, meteors, meteors, meteors)

Well it's only me, I'm the king of planet rock
I discovered the solar system when my teleporter stopped
And ya'll don't stop
I claim the Universe with just a human verse
The other astronaughts don't got the credentials I got
to make time travel asscension
A whole ocean of stars
cus Neil's arm wasn't strong
This antigravity song
But You deny me the fury
you drinkin rocket fuel
CD of monks, sponsored by coke
this Hip-Hop moved out of the army tent
The outer limits, the atmosphere is just a little passed here
Cus I'm a speed range junky, a high school flunky
Colico Vision, playing asteroids
It's The armeggedon meteor shower
It's the mother fucking Shapeshifters

when I, wake up, I'm disoriented
Sometimes, I think, we're all doomed!
You think, you know, witness history!
They could, just lie, and probably are!

You are now in the ports of entry, lifted eye brow
as I figure skate on fate like a triple sow-cow!
My juxtaposition is akin with surealism
my photo montage collage is exploration of dreams
It seems as if I can make the infastructure rupture
In short terms my words govern society
it occured mind collection bright minds of association
Never libelous; Ludichris in this incarnation!
Holding down the cure to control our population
Uncle dictator picks picks from this electrocution
People messed up, thinking they're set
With thoughts consumed by a salad fork, you dork!
Oh are you secure? Remove like a worry wort
You don't know the half like 621 flower court
My spirit swims, the wer of the words
But what you heard was slurred and your vision was blurred
Everything is different than you think it is
It is not as it appears

In this electric baby land with a neon trip inside my babys hand
The concentric plan damn Uncle Sam and his scam, thought he was the man
Could you withstand the sand in the time bottle?
That's a grand model, you better stand because I got no
Simple solution with this inevitable collision
With no liquid vision made just for vision of the body
Enslaved by the devils parade escapade from hell
what the fuck do you know about the planet rock 2012?
The oceans swelled the buildings fell, whatever
and it's hard to tell and harder to sell, forever look past never

Let us warn you! Before storming into this fun house
Run by the polotics of lunatics
Don't be tricked by the gimmicks of microchips
Think different, it's a different way of looking at things
Believe in Christ! Christmas is ridiculous
Rubber bullets and tear gas is how we spend our last momments together
In this armeggedon addition of Jerry Springer
I'm a Jerry's kid in the legend of Zelda
When fighting an invisable enemy here ye
The final calling the final story revealing the build up of electric shielding
Protecting the military bio domes, home to Destro's Y2K syndrome
Next stop thundar beyond thunder dome
wishing upon a falling star wars bob dobbs is mobb deep and balthazar
Seven second delay portrait of Earth view from Mars
Is a wack place to be says carl sagan lazer ray gun
Hulk Hogan hurry up and snap into it eat some power bars
Snack on Slim Jims to save the earthlings from the Tiahuana alien invation
And those evil Russians enslaved by the mansions of masons
Frustrated at the lack of education
Divided, lies, why do too many young black teenagers
Wind up handcuffed front page daily Planet Rock 2012
Reporting live from the gates of heck!

Universal law, mathematical language
Prophecies are least reason for man's anguish
The end is near, thou shall not fear
Most high appears in the form of a spear
Splits the hemisphere, a massive earth quake
Armeggedon begins, our souls are at stake
Punnish them all, the evil ones shall fall
All the souls evaporate, landscapes and all
Millenia maddness, holy war analysis
Carry the world on my back, like The Atlas
Every step I take increase mortal magic
Every breath I take decrease a mere savage
Rapid destruction, volcano eruption
Revelation forshadow Earth's abduction
Fresh for 2012 you suckers!</pre>
