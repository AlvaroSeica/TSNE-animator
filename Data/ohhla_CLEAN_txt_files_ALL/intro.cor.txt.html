[Cormega]
younawmsayin' son?
shit is real
yo, I'm from a place where niggaz get it on
and bullshitters get shitted on
and dead niggaz keep living on
and memories once the henny's pourin'
I see the sadness of so many mourned
yet the beauty of so many born
and the only man I trust is god
cause the devil come in many forms
on the day I rest eternally
I'll be a thug for eternity
the longer word is fire burning me
but you younger thugs could learn from me
love is love..</pre>
