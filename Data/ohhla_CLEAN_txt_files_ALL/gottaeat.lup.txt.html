[Intro - Lupe Fiasco]
I swear I see this nigga I'ma kill him
I'm going to kill him so make a nigga suffer
Ya know what I'm sayin'

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
Streets be all like feed me feed me
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
Streets be all like feed me feed me
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy

[Verse One - Lupe Fiasco]
Hey he had a whole lotta cheese
Plus he was a mack had a whole lotta seeds
Made a lot of niggas fat, gave a whole lotta G's
Grams man he had a whole lotta these
And he would let you hold like a whole lotta ki's
Even if you lose some he would give you new ones
Twice the bread its like he had two buns
And he had a whole lotta seeds
Even his kids had meals for reals
Some rich small fries wrapped in paper since they was lil
Ketchup nigga

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
Man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
Streets be all like feed me feed me
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy

[Verse Two - Lupe Fiasco]
He was a heart breaker and a large shaker
If it was bout cakin' he was a part taker
International he would take trips bon voyage
That's so hard he was fishin' for the chips
So greedy he never gave to the needy
Thats what some say
The way he shunned all the bums hangin' in the subways
He called them fruits then laughed at 'em
Delivery man on the pick-up drive through
And throw a bag at 'em
And it was hard to understand him sometimes
Makin' a killin' the way he had 'em standin in line

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
Man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
Streets be all like feed me feed me
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy

[Verse Three - Lupe Fiasco]
Lovers call him king, haters call him clown
He would say bite me that's the way its going down
He was havin' thoughts that maybe he should retire
Went to church on a Sunday and saw a deep frier
Said he had beef and people want him dead
He loved the hungry ones was only scared of the feds
He lived the fast life couldn't get his path right
Frier just told him 'bout the hooters that he had last night
Turned himself in to the paddywagon, said no
Bacon wouldn't take him half the pigs on the payroll

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
Streets be all like feed me feed me
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy

[Outro - Lupe Fiasco]
To be continued on another menu, ya dig?
Will he give up his life of crime or will he stay?
This, and other adventured on Lupe Fiasco's next album L.U.P.END

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
Streets be all like feed me feed me
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat that's when shit gets greasy</pre>
