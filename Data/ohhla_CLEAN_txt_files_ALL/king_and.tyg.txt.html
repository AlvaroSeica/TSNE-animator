[Intro]
We all dream one day we kings and queens {*2X*}
My nigga made it, we just young, livin the dream {*2X*}

[Tyga]
Uhh chandelier ceiling, my couch, don't sit with denim
My marble floors are killin, gold cars are so relentless
Five girls in the kitchen, they cookin somethin like chemists
Monumental shit is, statues like Egyptians
God cover my soul, need it, can't let it go
I know you get lonely when I ain't home, on the road
I know I ain't perfect, I'm out here workin for the throne
I would take you along but then that college loan you'll owe
Youn girls in cheap dresses, tryin to impress us
Sayin they all different, but I don't show 'em no effort
Underestimated that Dar 8, then I tested
Had to make investments, honey colored dressed it
I'm blessed it, crossed sign baptism West shit
Shit on anybody with opin-ions, you dead wrong
Go against a bull nigga head-on
I'm too strong, eight arms tickin to a bomb
Army stance, ready for war
We used a Andy Warhol to paint the decor
Apologizin for my actions sometimes I get bored
They say my music knocks, so I hope it open every door

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, livin the dream {*2X*}

[Wale]
Never take this shit to heart, I take indo to chest
And now a nigga chasin dreams without losin his breath
Though my credits are slept, my ambition the best
Though I do this to be heard, I'ma do it to death
We ain't cool with all of these niggaz I'm through with all of these niggaz
You fool with all of these niggaz you lose like all of these (niggaz)
Honest, sincere, they seersuckers, lyin in suits
Anybody ridin with young'n will probably recoup
Heavenly Father, Martin, Malcolm mixed with them lyrics
Fin' to be king, but I'm way too proud to offer as minion
I just offer a guillotine to my vehicle, nigga
And don't offer the least of shit to these people's opinions
I'm a kin to these niggaz, love a queen, fuck the bitches
Double-M-G, Y.M., C-M...B-cause we run this you dig?
We all kings, give anything to my soft Queens
I'm lost without them, when they around I am Charles Sheen

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Uhh~! Yeah, yeah
You're in the presence, of a majestic, esoteric
Message, from the most ghettoest king, worldwide respected
I can say ghettoest cause I come from where metal spit
Prayin to God I can slide and slip out the Devil's grip
Won't pop another pill, can't drink another sip
Tryin to slow down with this pussy, I can't, I love this shit
I seem to love these whips - a white
Maserati's my birthright car, pass it, I need another hit
At night, where they murdered Herbie Drawers
That's the same block Metta World Peace learned to play ball
See I'm born alone, die alone, from the hoods to the private home
College to prison, understand it, Knowledge and Wisdom
Shout out to baby mothers of niggaz who gangbang
Cause he could die any day and you still his thang thang
So that make you a queen, survivin anything
Escobar season begins, so let the semis ring
Pimp of the Year, I could smack your father
Not only with my hand, but with a black revolver
I been in pressed silk since breast milk
Mets cap on tilt, we some Kings nigga</pre>
