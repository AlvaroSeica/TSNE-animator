Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Turn it up til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Rock it, til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"

Get off of your lazy ass and do something for the people to make them feel it faster
Don't wanna post... holy ghost I can preach the pastor

{Electricity} I'm amazin
[?] I was gazing

Place to release my anger
I'm an angel with a gang of bangers
And I'm not home with a gang of strangers
Never stand still, it's a gang of danger
Gotta pop pills to contain my anger
Cause if I stay the same it's the days of lamer
So I'll rep there to rep yours
I really don't care, but I'm sure
That we can all lose weight, get in shape and maybe even get attractive
Get on up and g-g-Get Active!

Let me take you for a long ride, up and down
in and out, right around and out of your mind..
Get Active!
Let me take you for a long ride, up and down
in and out, right around and out of your mind!
Get Active!
B-b-baby!
B-b-baby!
Get Active!
B-b-baby!
B-b-baby!

Turn it up til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Turn it up til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Rock it, til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Rock it, til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"

[Irv Da Phenom:]
Pheee-nom!
Aaaaah!
Maybe you're gonna be the one to come up and act super cool
Kali hold on, let me break it down and explain the rules
See the women be the kitties [?] see you make your move
[?] do the fool
Get up outta your mind and get super loose
Dudes be coo-coo
Break it off the chain like I'm bad, dawg
[?]
Better get to dancing your ass off
Get crunk like Zu-lus
I'm counting down for that blast off
(5-4-3-2-1)
OK, it's on let's act a ass ya'll!

Get Active!
Let me take you for a long ride, up and down
in and out, right around and out of your mind..
Get Active!
Let me take you for a long ride, up and down
in and out, right around and out of your mind!
Get Active!
B-b-baby!
B-b-baby!
Get Active!
B-b-baby!
B-b-baby!

Turn it up til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Turn it up til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Rock it, til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"
Rock it, til your mama tell you "Turn it down!"

[Krizz Kaliko:]
Give em a little anaphylactic shock, your body is overreactin

Cause if I stay stagnant, then I'm gon' get backwards
Kick my bad habits, I gotta G-GOTTA Get Active!

Let me take you for a long ride, up and down
