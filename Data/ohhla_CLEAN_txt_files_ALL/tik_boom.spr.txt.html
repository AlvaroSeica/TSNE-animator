[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
You got sex siren in your face, let me get up on it
Let me get up on it, l-let me get up on it
Talk dirty to me babe, every time I want it
Every time I want it, ev-every time I want it

[Pre-Chorus]
Hush, please no more games
No more of the same thing
Been thinking maybe could he
Make me scream his name
And give me the right aim
Boy, can you tame these goodies?

[Chorus]
Better make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik
Better make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Not too slow and not too quick, baby make me tik, tik, boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik
Better make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom
Not too slow and not too quick, baby make me tik, tik, boom

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
Hush your mouth, lock it up, why you wanna flaunt it?
Why you wanna flaunt it? Wh-why you wanna flaunt it?
The earth turns, switch it up, let me get up on it
Let me get up on it, le-let me get up on it

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Rap Verse: T.I.]
Turn it, ay!
C'mere for a minute, let me taste you baby
Light your fuel, detonate you baby
My brain have you going insane
but my dynamite stick known to drive shit crazy baby
Annd while you're layin up in the bed with your feet up
Right there in my wife beater
She like the way I eat her, beat her, beat her
Treat her like an animal, somebody call PETA (oh~!)
Put a little bit of this inside a margarita
Then put the thang in her, have her runnin like a meter
on a cab in the city where the girls are pretty
Find me in the club where the girls get busy
with a flat stomach, fat booty, nice shaped titties
My wrist so froze you could ice skate with it
{Better make me tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, tik, boom}
Give it to you 'til you curlin your toes
Get your ass outcha clothes, sit back here, but hold the explosion

[Chorus]</pre>
