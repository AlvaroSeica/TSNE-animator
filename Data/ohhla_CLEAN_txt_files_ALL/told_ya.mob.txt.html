Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
My bitch love, she love me
Gangsta Papi, from the East
And I got that coke for sale
Dirt cheap, talk to me
I'm thankful for my connect
Sidewalk exec, OG respect
Dead Prez rollie, cuban link hang on my neck
Lex coupe, 99, big trouble, 45
Shoot 'em, shoot 'em, shoot 'em, came here to remove 'em
Give me black and blue diamonds in my watch, how I bruise 'em - no kiddin'
Clear blue 'em, day after pill den lose 'em, I got one
I wanna pop tax for ten years straight, I'm gettin there
You been afraid, I been prepared since I was ten years
Oh, I'm a young God, that's word to old law
Told that bitch to suck my...
I thought I told her?

[Chorus]
Huh, huh, huh?
I thought I told ya?

[Verse 2: A$AP Ant]
Riding real slow, getting this dough
Sippin &amp; tippin &amp; drinkin real slow
Blowing out O's, gun on my side
Gun in my ride, gettin that chrome
Hittin &amp; splittin &amp; crackin your dome
Niggaz be sick, pulling they bitch
Having their hoes, suck on my dick
Lord Infamous shit, shout out to Three 6
Switchin my flow like I'm switchin my hoes
(Pass the purp man
Don't try and talk smoke)
Niggaz talk crazy we taking they dough
Big long.44 with the nose
Left em slump in the driver seat
Fuck the Benz, just a Grand Marquis
Loot in the backseat, menace to society
Trap in a house fuck cops can't find me
Over the stove, still mixing
Selling big wait, no pitchin
Cookin sittin flippin'
Ink for the trappin', trap for a million
Aim for the sky got no time for ceiling', nigga
