Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Before I dust and wipe off the gun
And take this niggas life I might come talk to some
I know you real and he yawning
But even when you ready to die
You get a warning
Because I compensate my shooters won't conversate
Your life they'll confiscate, that's what I contemplate
Question, you know who you fucking with?
You know how many guns is in that fucking whip?
You see that hummer that's right up the strip?
You think I care who you runnin with
I heard you say textin me ain't the antidote
Serve you off that white truck like I'm makin banana boats
Clip the size of a can of coke
Food to my labor, silencer was a cantilope
Walk down the alley, in these streets a nigga can't elope
You can't touch this, this hammer ain't broke

[Chorus]
Yeah I know you just banged chrome
And your niggas just came home
I'm just tryina tell you sumn, tell you sumn
I'm just tryina tell you sumn, tell you sumn
Yeah I heard you tend shit up with that shottie
Swear I don't care about the bodies
I'm just tryina tell you sumn, tell you sumn
I'm just tryina tell you sumn, tell you sumn

[Verse 2]
You got nothing for me, your kid will come from school
Like look what Fred bought me
Just setting direct
So you know that I know where you rest
So if you wanna rest in peace, be my guest
Like you callin the cab base I'll address you
You better hide out your issues before I press shoot
But you God pride, and you reppin thug
Even your wolves won't win, ask Kevin Love
You a nigga that niggas never loved
A week from now, you be getting some of that reverend love
Like here lies what's his name
Shottie in your baby mom's mouth
Bitch what's his name
I got an AK and a 9,
House plan, you a broke nigga pay me no mind
I got the whole calico grip to blow shit
And I don't give a fuck who you go get

[Chorus]
Yeah I know you just banged chrome
And your niggas just came home
I'm just tryina tell you sumn, tell you sumn
I'm just tryina tell you sumn, tell you sumn
Yeah I heard you tend shit up with that shottie
Swear I don't care about the bodies
I'm just tryina tell you sumn, tell you sumn
I'm just tryina tell you sumn, tell you sumn</pre>
