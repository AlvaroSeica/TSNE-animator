[Intro: Cold 187Um]
Man, I'm at the light, man 
Niggaz is mad dogging
I'm looking at the light, I'm looking at them niggaz
I'm looking at the light, I'm looking at their bitches
I'm looking at the light, I'm looking at my shit
I'm thinking this shit is real
This shit is real

[Cold 187Um]
Yeah, now tell me who wanna step to the real?
As I'm beating down their block with my clip ready to trip
Ugh, yeah, now player haters getting chin checked quick
Running off, with the mouth, like the jealous groupie bitch
Yo, I'ma jack him for his motherfucking loot
His house, his bitch and his motherfucking Lexus Coup√©
Well, if you killed me you can have all that
But if not, don't be surprised who that missle been launched at
Cause in the cell, realest they can't get
Nigga, check your nuts cause you fucked
Ugh, yeah, and then it's just like you all taking mild
Cause they don't give a fuck about your bitch or your child
Have you all tied up in the house
Dynamite rip your ass with a gauge in your mouth
Mad as fuck, cause you're squealing like a bitch
But they gonna kill everybody, before somebody snitch
Now, everybody's getting hit up
Cause some bullshit got twisted and got messing your fuck
Because you cats playing dumb, me and my niggaz was out
When I was rolling in the Candy blue 'llac on whips
I be the player for life, ride
I get love from the blue and the red side
So lay them out all over my gun smoke
I never slipped when I'm rolling on my 100 Spokes, bitch

[Chorus: PEE GEE singing X2]
You got the fliest shit
You got air lines
You look so fly of, so fly of
Of them 100 Spokes

[Hook: DJ Total K-Oss]
As I floss my 100 Spokes there's no joke
As I floss my 100 Spokes there's no joke
As I floss my 100 Spokes there's no joke
As I floss my 100 Spokes there's no joke

[KM.G]
When I bought my 100 Spokes, I bought a four five
Just for a nigga like the KM, to stay alive
Deep into the motherfuckering three, but we call it the trey
Built like Coloride but it's name My Choverlet
Flowing and crowing what I need to
To get though the hood, nigga, or get to my crew
And meditate, and regulate, never perpetrate
And plot on these busters, they gets fate
Legit, hard, works this shit when it comes to them riders
My Anchor got 3 wheel, funk track provider
Rules to through motherfucking sounds I'm giving
Westcoast I know you love it, and wish you can live it
Hear something about them 100 Spokes
When they be like dipping, whipping around delight women
Freaking all the freaky bitches when they're like spinning
Above the Law giving it up

[Chorus: PEE GEE singing X2]

[Outro: DJ Total K-Oss repeats until fade]
As I floss my 100 Spokes there's no joke
As I floss my 100 Spokes there's no joke
As I floss my 100 Spokes there's no joke
As I floss my 100 Spokes there's no joke</pre>
