[Speak]
Wakin up somewhere in Ladera
Next to a girl with smeared mascara
Her looks say groupie, first name Sarah
Another victim of the art goon era
Holy fuck - what am I becomin
Momma said I need to go and do somethin stunnin
With my life, instead I seat here soakin by the fireplace
Breakin down weed tryin to find a higher place
Addicted to porno and cyberspace
Eternal sunshine 'round tight mind erase
God damn sometimes I be forgettin
Every lesson learned in the college room settin
I didn't make the grade so I didn't give a damn
Intelligent but lazy, they couldn't understand
What it's like to be better than everyone you know
Or what it's like to make a few fuckin racks off a show
Pockets on swoll, ego on overload
Drugs all around and I pray I don't overdose
If I do I'll leave a beautiful corpse
Bury me in my tux with a carton of 'ports

[Chorus]
Life ain't nothin but a rose parade
Everythin that we see artificially made
And we all line up to take a look at the floats
But why the fuck would I want to stay behind this rope?

[Speak]
Nope -  daddy was right, I never do listen
but the blind old cunt couldn't really see my vision
Credit score low when I never held a job down
Snackin on Xany bars just so I could calm down
My friends question why I'm so off-beat
or why I choose to write my name in wet concrete
Dream and sit back all day and romanticize
Do as fuck girls get guapped then they vadalise
Burn it all down, pissin on the ashes
And watch her deep throat for some backstage passes
God damn, is that how momma raised you?
Or is everything I do just amaze you?
Fuck payin dues, I'm too punk son
I rather fuck a white girl with a trust fund
and blow her dough instead of spendin mine
One of a kind, young rap God with a shrine, yeeh

Ricardo! Get the God damn hovercraft
The whores are after our money again

[Chorus]</pre>
