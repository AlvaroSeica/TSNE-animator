Song:   Streets
Typed by: Lil Hustle

That's the nigga that's gone...

[Chorus]
We can take it to the streets, because that's where it belong
I'm a marksman with this heat, put it square on your dome
Two wrong's don't make it right, someone gon' catch a flight
The first one to see the light, that's the nigga that's gone

[Big Pokey]
I'm a bull like I'm born in May, I rush niggaz
Flush niggaz like commodes, when I bust my triggas
Everytime I bust, try to knock the must off niggaz
Push a wig piece back in the gap, what nigga
Talking down that's gon' get ya slapped, ya slut nigga
Close your trap, get merked while you holding your strap
Last time I saw that boy, he was holding his ass
I popped him with the dime, then I throwed it harass
Slow your roll, nigga stay in your class
I got niggaz waiting on my call, rolling with a K and a mask
Handgun knock the cameras, tre-8 with a flash
Bring the plex to your yard, it's a ape in your grass
Bring the plex to your squad, tre-8 and a mag
One way in, only way to vacate is a bag
Don't play with me, play with your dick
Because the first nigga that see the light, that's the nigga that's gone

[Chorus - 2x]

[Kevo]
Ok let's clear all the bullshit, look I don't hustle to play
You bitches, better get up out of my way
If I don't fuck wit ya that's just it, y'all get the picture
Ain't no love lost, feel my mindset to get richer
I got a street raised mentality
And you'll get capped, for your bullshit salary
Nigga you can expect the worst of the worst, when them 'Burbans and them Hummers out
I pack enough guns, to make your block do a summersault
I'm overloaded, when it starts to roll it's tenacity
Clapping off guns, that eat a slab to the fastening
Bulletproof cars get laughed at, when they passing me
I rig em with C4, to show these hoes audacity
There's rules to this game, play your part and follow
Before you bite off more, than your heart can swallow
If I don't fuck with ya that's just it, y'all get the picture
See me in the streets nigga, we can settle the sco'

[Chorus - 2x]

[Chris Ward]
We can take it to the street, like construction work
And on this beat, do ya know what my production's worth
But fuck all that, just throw that when my glock bust it hurt
And after I kill ya I come to your funeral, and bust at your hearse
Just to see the niggaz carrying your casket, drop your shit
Take off running, duck in the dirt
So when you boys need a light, it ain't the one that the Lord'll give ya
But the one, that nigga C. Ward'll give ya
With this candy red dot, I'm a architect
That'll blaze your brains with flames, and scorch the set
It's like you the strength for once, I'ma spark the wet
You looking at a nigga that hung, slung and fought with vets
Yeah I was raised by the wildest niggaz
Con artists city slick cut throat, Mob-stylish niggaz
And that's only the half of why, I'll split your wig
Cause with a gun, I'm like Billy the buster Wiggity kid

[Chorus - 2x]

[Beezo]
Let's take it back, to the knuckles and fist fights
Back to the streets back to the spot, where they carry the heat
You slip you sleep you in too deep, that's how the guard reap play
You get it how you live, 24 a day
Money come fast and spend quicker, dope and liquor
Hoes and niggaz, scamming for figgas the streets the place
I'm straight by my waist your face, I know that
Two wrong's don't make a right, but I'm right in this case
Cause you done wronged me for the last time, I see the light and I blast mine
Moving in a devine manner, jumping out with my hammer
For you scandalous type, that could not handle it right
You could not handle it real, so you made a side deal
Could not keep it gangsta, had to play the field
So the feeling is mutual, the line's been crossed
So now we back to the bricks in the South, the clips and the guns
We back to the streets, and the block where it begun</pre>
