[Intro: Pitbull]
Went from Mr. Three-Oh-Five (Dade County)
To Mr. Worldwide (all around the world)
And now - we're international, so international
International, so international

[Pitbull]
You can't catch me boy (can't catch me boy)
I'm overseas at about a hundred G's per show
Don't test me boy (don't test me boy)
Cause I rap with the best fo'sho'
Three-oh-five to the death of me
Cremate my body let the ocean have what's left of me
But for now, forget about that
Blow the whistle, baby you the referee

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You put it down like New York City - I never sleep
Fly like Los Angeles - my fantasy
Hot-ter than Miami - I-I-I feel the heat
Ohhhhh-ohhh, Miss International Love {*2X*}

[Pitbull]
I don't play football but I've touched down everywhere
(Everywhere?) Everywhere~!
I don't play baseball but I've hit a home run
everywhere, everywhere
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I ain't know existed
In Romania, she pulled me to the side and told me
"Pit, you can have me and my sister"
In Lebanon, yeah, the women are bomb
And in Greece, you've guessed it, the women they sweet
Been all around the world but I ain't gon' lie
There's nothin like Miami's heat

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
Down in D.R., they lookin for visas
I ain't talkin credit cards, if you know what I mean
En Cuba, la cosa esta dura
But the woman get down, if you know what I mean
En Colombia the women got everything done
But they some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil, they freaky with big ol' booties
And they thongs - blue, yellow and green~!
En L.A., tengo a la Mexicana
En New York, tengo la boricua
Besitos para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah
Y en Miami, tengo cualquiera

[Chorus]

[Chris Brown] + (Pitbull)
There's, not a place
That your love don't affect me baby
So don't, ever change
I cross the globe when I'm with you baby
Heyy!	(Chris Brown) Ohhhhh (this for the women worldwide)
(Let's ride)

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro: Pitbull] + (Chris Brown)
You're international, so international {*3X*}
(What what, what what, international)
Surrounded by beautiful girls
(What what, what what, international love)</pre>
