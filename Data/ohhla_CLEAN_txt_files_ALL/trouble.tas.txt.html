Double


Chorus:
[Double] Never felt like this before
        My heart's beating fast
[Tasha]  Let it flow, just
        Let it go
[Double] I'm falling in love
        Never felt like this before
        But
        Now I'm so sure
[Tasha]  Let it go, just
        Let it flow
[Double] I'm falling in love
[Both]   With you

[Tasha]
(Verse 1)
Your eyes aphrodisiac, you got me actin' silly
Marinate my soul, with your finger tip milky
Similac, smooth with your lips silky, silky
Oooh! I'm getting dizzy like I spun 360
You put me in the mood to be
Very bad and kinky
I know you feel the same because your body keeps telling me
Now play me on the right spot, I'll be your sweet melody
Sock it to me (Uh!)
Make it last til infinity
Old school love, it's like deja vu
Ever since we met, can't stop thinking about you
True, we barely know each other
I'm not tryin' to be your lover
I just want to try and get to know you better
So
Don't deny, what you
Feel inside
I'm sensin' a vibe, but we ain't got a lot of time, so
Here's my number
Gimme a call
Cause if you feel the same way, there's no time to stall

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Hey you (Hey you)
I barely know your name (What's your name?)
I'm feeling somewhat the same, but one thang has changed
I must confess, I think about us undressed
Caress your back until you feel the (Uh!)
Never the less
I know you feeling me
You needing me
But you gotta let me know
So if you really want me, baby boy, let it show
I ain't the type to sit around and just wait
So when you strike the nerve, it just might be too late

[Double]
Stop, playing these games
Let's do this
I really need to know
If, you feel the same way too
Boy let me know
You
Boy, you got the stuff
I need you
To know what I mean
So just let it, happen
You'll see

Repeat Chorus Twice

Hook: Double
Never felt like this before
I wanna know you much more
Even if you have a girl
I don't need to make it sure

Repeat Hook

(Verse 3)
what up boo, yo, I knew you'd come around
Whisper in my ear, yeah, I like the way that sound
It took some time, but now it all makes sense
It's only been a day but now my feelings grown intense
It's
So much more than I
Hoped it would be
I can't describe the feeling when you put your arms around me
Old school love, it's like deja vu
Ever since we met, can't stop thinking about you

Repat Chorus Twice
