[Intro: The Weeknd - chopped and screwed]
I don't got a single sober vein in my body...
I don't got a single sober vein in my body...

[The Weeknd]
Don't a, don't a, don't a, don't a, don't apologize, I quite enjoy messy
I see that bottle after bottle got you goin' crazy
And doin' shows after shows got me so lazy
So ride it out for me, and take it off for me
It's a good vibe, good vibe, good vibe
Don't you ever threaten niggas with a good time
She wanna buy a dream, I said I don't sell it
But she can rent it for a night, I don't mind, open wide
Cause all this fame, I earned it, I might as well use it
Private elevator goin' straight to my unit
All my niggas 'round me, gettin' kickback pussy
All my killas 'round me, all be hiding in Stussy
Can't nobody stop me, used to be homeless
Now that penthouse at the Ritz where my home is
Tour bus like a National Geographic
Bitches runnin' wild, gettin' faded in the bathroom

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
It makes me smile, it makes me smile, cause I got it {*echoes*}
It makes me smile, it makes me smile, cause I got it {*echoes*}
All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece but now we got it
Man look at the kid now, can nobody stop me?
I don't got a single sober vein in my body

[Rick Ross]
UHH! UHH!
Fuck her like a thug nigga, young nigga, new Ferrari
Old money, I just 'fraid the Lord with us
Condo blow money, like it's all dope money
Come short wet niggas, like a speed boat comin'
Ohh Lord! Mo money, mo money
These rich young niggas ain't ever know money
Bel-Air runnin' down the Rollie on her arm (UH!)
Pinky ring six-hundred, what you know about it? (what)
I'm the champ, baby, Real Deal Holyfield (HUH!)
Got the bitches, want it dirty, went and bought the crib
25 mil, I'm doin' 25-to-life
100 acres, keep my shooters all through the night (ahh)
Every chandelier rented, nigga, one-mil
20 chandeliers motherfucker who real (HUH!)
I just wanna show her what I live like
Wearin' a white birkin on a winter night
Fuck a Berkin, now she in the Bentley
That's when she went and tatted Double M-G {M-M-M}
Now I ballin' deep, +Deeper Than The Rap+
She give me brain she a +Mastermind+ to be exact
.., She a +Mastermind+ to be exact
... I give her game and she give it back
... Sip syrup so I fuck slow
... Sip more I wanna fuck more
Gotta grind 'til your eyes close
Stay strapped 'til the trap close
They scream Maybach on the cell blocks
All my dawgs who used to sell blocks
They say the niggas in the jail talk
How your homies commissary fell off
What make it worse he get an elbow
25-to-life dead wrong on the cell phone

[Chorus]</pre>
