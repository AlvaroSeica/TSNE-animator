Album:  This Gigantic Robot Kills
Song:   (Lord It's Hard to be Happy When You're Not) Using the Metric System
Typed by: @mc_lars (Horris Records)

(Yardsticks are pathetic)

12 inches per foot
2 pints per quart
Why don't we make it easy?
The English system of measurement must be laid to history
We can use units of 10 and convert with ease
Just like all the other countries
I am in command yes I am taking a stand
From this disease we must be free! (Good God!)

CHORUS
You are drunk with your tradition that has no validity
While I'm intoxicated with smarts and metrics
Come drink a deciliter with me
We want metrics, we want them now! We know we can win!
I weigh 170 pounds, that's 90 kilograms
See metrics can even make me thin

(Yardsticks are pathetic)

All cool things are in metrics
For example here's just one
I got my "nine" well that's 9 millimeters
Sounds cooler then my .3 something inches gun!
The powerful, if non-existent "they" will call me communist
They'll call me scum, but it's worth it
Canadians will think we're smart or at least not as dumb

CHORUS

The revolution's here
We must overcome at last
As we symbolically stick their 12 inch foot up their antiquate assÂ… guitar!
