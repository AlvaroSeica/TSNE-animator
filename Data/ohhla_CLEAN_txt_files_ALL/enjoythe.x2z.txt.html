[Chorus: Brevi]
We gon' get fucked up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night
We gon' get fucked up, and that's alright, that's alright
Raised in the gutter, I'ma find a way, everything is okay, ohh oh-oh
Baby lift your cup up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night

[Xzibit]
Amsterdam to Tokyo, longitude only I can know
Latitude is my attitude, fall in place like a domino
I ain't come here to make no friends, cause I'd rather be feared than loved
Scared to death that I'll move this mountain and get to you with this shotgun slug
And I can never turn my back on the ways of life
I'm sparin no expense, top down Vegas lights
My flow stay virgin tight, I do not give a fuck
It's 'bout to jump tonight, my crib is fillin up
It's fillin up, it's fillin up - full of bitches I ain't never met
And they ain't left like these bitches here on house arrest
Line up ten shots, I'll knock down six, dark and light but that shit don't mix
Got a bodybag full of pills and shit, let's see how fucked up we all gon' get
Yeah!

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Hahaha, uhh, turn me up
Raised in the gutter (gutter) bread gettin butter (butter)
Face like her mother (mother) ass like she's Southern (Southern)
Hahaha, so much cash I just gotta laugh (gotta laugh)
Out in Paris smokin grass, signin autographs (autographs)
It's apparent if it's foreign then I'm starin
If it's shinin then I'm near it, it's designer then I wear it, oh
Look at these diamonds, spent some time on my appearance
You too busy savin hoes you ain't gon' find a dime on clearance, oh
You know me bitch, I get straight down to the point (down to the point)
Pop another bottle, roll another joint (roll another joint)
And all of my niggaz O.G.'s and all that I smoke is O.G.
I'm way too high to be low-key, better act like you know me

[Chorus]

[David Banner] + (Brevi)
Girl if you wanna get some drunk dick
You can come and get it from me, get it from me {"David Banner"}
I know I shouldn't mix all this vodka 
with this Hennessy, Hennessy - ha, uh
But we gon' get (we gon' get fucked up) then pour it up, drink big
Party like it's '99, put a 1-9 before that bitch
We gon' sip until we get sick, we gon' blaze until we get lit
Call Earl, the world's spinnin, tiger blood bitch, yeah we winnin
The girl that you love was good in the beginnin
Two good shots and now the girl sinnin
Bend her over, now I'm sober, face, breasts, boat, BRBRBR!

[Xzibit]
Line up ten shots, I'll knock down six, dark and light but that shit don't mix
Got a bodybag full of pills and shit, let's see how fucked up we all gon' get

[Chorus]
