Typed by: AZ Lyrics

this the top, oh yeah the tippy
its young khalifa mannn
I see it clearly the money that is
oh yall niggaz aint in the way keep doing what you doing
see right thru you

Got me drinking out the bottle
living for today aint thinking about tomorrow
niggaz fake I can see it with my eyes closed
in desperate need of a leader so they follow
and me I only see chavo
I roll up blizzy and hit it like a high note
my skin tough as a rhinos
so keep hating I keep dating these dime hoes
diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my chain
city or your state catch me mobbin with my gang
nigga violate they wont hestiate to aim
man I got enough change to afford the price of fame
im like poison to yall lames, or drugs or prescriptions
turn my music on get a buzz when you listening
you want them then pay for em
and niggaz talk fly but im space gone up out of here

[Chorus]
I never sleep but I got big dreams
lil nigga I do big things
you know its everything that it seems
they say my life is like the big screen (big screen)
I fill my bank with every 16
my money straight and my bitch mean
you should wait and get a ticket please
they say my lifes like the big screen (big screen)

I feel like a desperado, on the track I just kick it like rihlo
see me on the tv ya I be in grind mode
but please believe im in the streets like pot holes
Antonio no guitar tho, only instrumental is that pistol
need a right hand so I fucks with chevy
and underneath the wing so I hustle heavy
tatted on my face, chest, neck, hand, stomach
been on that paper chase since that cake start runnin
never touched the brick, I aint never slung no drugs
I still get a feeling when I see that gold car coming
got my pops old soul, im a 80s baby
moms smoke hella weed im a wavy baby
you mr me 2, and you need fuel man
you niggaz see through air

[Chorus]</pre>
