I have got a special hat
Mmm-mmm

Woke up this morning, feeling super
Where's the butler?  Pass me the butter
My muffins are freshly baked
Wake up, then I stretch and shake

My life, well yes it's great
Like I live on a slice of special cake (Mmm)
With a load of ingredients
If my home is my castle that's most convenient
Because my home is a castle
And I laugh at the top of my turrets

My drawbridge is over a moatfield
With tea and I'm far above it
I just love it, this life of mine
Like everyday is a private shine
Lighting my way through the unsightly times
To the stage where I find that the mic is mine

I love it, to see the friendly faces
View as strange as my fan bases
I love them almost paternally
I have an orang-utan serving me
Is that so ecentric?
Invention just makes me open-ended
So if you're special but no-one's said it
Shout with me "It's all so splendid"

It's splendid
Yes indeed
It's splendid
I'm really pleased
It's splendid
Well isn't that nice?
It's splendid
So sing it twice
It's splendid

Yes indeed
It's splendid
I'm really pleased
It's splendid
Well isn't that nice?
It's splendid
(ha-ha)
[man and woman sigh]

That took it out of me
Where am I again?
Oh yes, there we go (aaahhhhh)

The fresh smell of a newly mowed lawn
First cup of joy on a misty morn
When you sip from a dark brew
In a sharp suit watching cartoons
Your very own baby
Flame haired ladies
Lovely roast hen with Yorkshires and gravy
Or a ride where you scream for joy on a steam-powered flying machine
Or a scene from your new ambition played in the present tense
Or some sentiments sent from a loved one to end offence
Or eleven pence paid for a Marmoquin 
Sitting at a bar with a glass of Pimm's
Getting what you want for your birthday
Or watching the Las Vegas Mermaids
Sitting in a deck chair listening to sea
Or listening to me
Knowing that you said what you said and you meant it because everything is ever so 

It's splendid!
Yes indeed!
It's splendid
I'm really pleased
It's splendid
Well isn't that nice?
It's splendid
So sing it twice!
It's splendid</pre>
