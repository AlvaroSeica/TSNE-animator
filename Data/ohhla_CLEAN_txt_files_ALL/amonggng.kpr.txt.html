[Killah Priest]
From apartments to porches
From park bench to corners
From lobbies to alley's
There's warrants a warrin'
Warnin' for flags and dress codes
Death holds everyone for ransom
A fresh note, hit up Escobar's grandson
Responsible for mountains of coke up the U.S. nose
They clamp thumbs and kill wives
It's hand gun if your bill's high
Suicide, two in his thigh, one flew in his eye
It's time you die

(Hook) 2x
What makes a gangster happy
Could make a gangster cry
No mercy in a killer's eyes
Those time flies, niggas get high
Babies are born, gangsters die
Which way we choose is up to you to decide

[Killah Priest]
The never world bosses, warehouse office
Collect the shares and count their losses
Then extortion, their girls are gorgeous
Underworld wit Porsche's 
Nauseous, bullets break champagne, enormous
Analyzin' the fortune, crime lords across the chair board
Cigar smoke, expensive painting on the walls
Which hears them all; this place is bugged, tapped
They hired a rat; grab the gut to make me trapped
Now how we gon' pat

(Hook) 2x

[Killah Priest]
Gun battles, kidnappin' murder
Betrayal, unleash the demons of the never world
Grab the pearls, sexy girls, sheer stockin'
Brassiere's poppin', love shoppin'
Thug's option, shoot his way out
Or sleep eternal in a grave house
Or slave route, hide-out
Nat Turner, gats will learn ya
Collapse wit the burner
Dead fingers clutch, his tongue out
Floor full of guts
His horse screamin' pullin' him up
Damn you shoulda ducked

(Hook) 2x</pre>
