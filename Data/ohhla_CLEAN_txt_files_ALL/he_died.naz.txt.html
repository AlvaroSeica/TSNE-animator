Typed by: Knowledge God, Cno Evil

[Intro: sample]
His words like wings across the battered skies
Of all illiteracies

[Bronze Nazareth]
Science Olympia, rhyming on empty pad
Devour the hymen, I'm grinding like this track was ass
Here's some medicine, radios won't let me in
Never sin when it comes to severing a clever pen
This is how we measure men, no rhymes will ever send
me into a frenzy again 'cause, condemn the empty wind
Fable with golden words or filthy stolen verbs
Rock them like glass pipes, strike like they're high twice
Like it's from my life, nasty on the iron pipes
What ever strikes a better fight
I'm better than you, ask your Old Earth for a-alikes
My radar strikes to aim my vice grip, range is nice
Aim is twice that of navy seals, aiming at lidless tap
Spill your wig 'cause red squirt on your dress slacks
My pen light but enlight, send you to Heaven twice
Once to bring back Pun, the second to end your life
Snipe concise, my life is defined between the blue lines of college crew notebooks
And rhymes and audio fives with no hooks
I use heat like a cook, keep your cipher shuck
Like Michael walking three miles with a pipe and hook
I'm slightly crook but a good man who doesn't have a touch
Toting a dutch, with a razor under a cobra clutch, slow or rushed
'Cause words take a minute to touch, I grimace and bust
Out of limits is touch this, send you to the 'Twilight Zone'
I'm high like what's glowing when the skylights is on
Unidentified objects are blown from the concrete stone
I'm nasty like bones underneath killers' homes

[Chorus: Kevlaar 7]
Push the blade inside, reside in cemeteries
Legendary Virgin Mary, blueberry rhyme wind gust
Duck sixteen rhymes bitch, I got seventeen bullets
Leave you full of death breath and blood nigga

[Bronze Nazareth]
I'm double good, probably double wood on shelves
I might as well be sent to Hell 'cause I'm the Devil himself
The vocal booth, crack your molar tooth
Built the solar crew, keep your sonar cubes
To the Wu-Tang school with Sunz of Man
Who run the wind, earth and fire, moms burnt McGuyver
But near the city power wires, rain, shower, fires
And drowned men in wind, the seminal's in
They hear such homicide again
The coroner came in and said 'He Died from Pen'

[Chorus: Kevlaar 7]
Push the blade inside, reside in cemeteries
Legendary Virgin Mary, blueberry rhyme wind gust
Duck sixteen times bitch, I got seventeen bullets
Leave you full of death breath and blood hiccups</pre>
