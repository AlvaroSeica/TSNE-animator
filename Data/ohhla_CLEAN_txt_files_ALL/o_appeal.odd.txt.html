Then why does life feel like an educated guess &amp;
My thoughts are like meals I'm a sucker for seconds
impressions got allot of us stressing
but how we are perceived is more about a reflection
&amp; the reception warm that I receive
which leads to believe these hoes like what I heave
Tall women in heels, tour money &amp; deals
off the no bull I like all money for real more
time aboard &amp; less time at home
less time for broads &amp; more time in zones
yeah, I'm in it while
flying out of another one
This is a new beginning, I'm climbing out of the other one
The dream feel real'er than it ever been
&amp; I was aiming high like a nigga being president
the possibilities of that are pretty evident
so being self employed is not seeming like a definite
But staying that way
is what I'm F'ing &amp; like minded people are the only ones I'm messing with

I'm trying to get mine in this life time
the after life is much further in pipeline

I'm in inclined to believe that but truth is, that for death
any moment is the right time
so I live like everyday is my last
but I plan for tomorrow as if I will never pass
A Pharoah on the subway

who never had dreams of jets but fell asleep on run ways
I just know that one day, that anything I needed I could mold
get everything you want it ain't always good for the soul
a mix of self worth, some help, a little control
&amp; I don't know the rest, good as mine is your guess
the recipe ain't the best, to make it though is our quest
&amp; if you choose to except, the meaning of life is yes

cause only god knows, those of us in the flesh, get the privilege of test
some will fail &amp; some will pass
we all get the same grade though when we run the path
but how you grade your self is
the mark that will matter most
to separate the heart of the strong &amp; the battered folks have a dose
Shit so real, I kill shit to live nigga, schizo feel
I got a hunger for knowledge &amp; I miss no meals
I stay high off life &amp; I miss no pills
I'm addicted to thrill of walking along the edge
not knowing what lies ahead but always knowing the deal
I'm good with my decisions, the set backs &amp; gains
is all a part of the game, I'm ready to spin the wheel
what ever is in store, I'm ready for, for sure
the attitude of wealth with the gratitude of the poor
the balance is the challenge &amp; I sit so still
between callous &amp; analysis but this no frills
I'm off the chain, been that way since slaves to flav
from 93 till infinity I'm slated in ways that's etched in stone
the age where we market out selves
I'm still all about the music I don't monitor plays
I don't monitor hits &amp; I don't monitor clicks
I monitor the snare drum &amp; the bottom of kicks
is anybody left that still fuck with this true shit
well let me hear you scream over top of this CRU shit

This so real, not knowing what's ahead but i'ma go there still
living in the moment got a hopeless feel
but the feeling in itself got it's own appeal
but I know, I'm attracted to the lights in the distance
the closer that I get &amp; the brighter my wish gets
excited by the risk &amp; the chances taken
not sure what I'm putting my faith in
but I'ma alright</pre>
