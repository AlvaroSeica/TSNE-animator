[Intro: Jazze Pha]
You are now tuned in {*laughter*}
(It's Gucci) It's a movie baby~!
Yeah baby, pop me some popcorn
We up in here, motion picture shit baby
Watch me!!

[Gucci Mane]
I'm jumpin out my coupe with the missin roof (roof)
And I'm so fuckin high I need a parachute (wow)
"Gucci Mane, do you remember me from last month?"
Girl, I can't remember nothin but my last blunt
Bling blaow diamond necklaces for every chain
Bitch I'm Gucci so I put rims on 'bout everythang
I used to care about money nowadays I don't
So if I like her enough I'll buy her everythang she want
I got that 3-5-7 so don't try your luck
Bullets have yo' body hot you'll need a fire truck
So re-up with us, got white girl yeah that anime
Today I'm shittin on rappers so I called up Jazze Pha
(Oh boy!!)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane] + (Jazze Pha)
I'm not a boy, so I can not be your boyfriend
But if you want me to then I can be yo' Gucci Mane
And if yo' man can't beat it up then I bet Gucci can
Just ask yo' lady and I bet that she's a Gucci fan
(Ladies and gentlemen!) Gucci - buy all my hoes
Gucci - most all my clothes
Gucci - this ain't no Coogi
You still cain't move me
And this is the soundtrack of the Gucci Mane movie
The Gucci Mane movie, the Gucci Mane movie (woo-weee!)

[Gucci Mane]
Lambo' engine in the rear, and I'm switchin gears
Y'all suckers can not fuck with this young nigga here
Diamonds on my neck colder than a case of beer
So when I fall off in the club all the bitches cheer
M6 convertible my top can disappear
Just bought a house in Cali pool parties all through the year
Timbs, fade, stupid waves, I don't wear a beard
They say that Gucci stay fresh but the nigga weird
I shop at Phil Plaza, lil' buddy he shop at Sears
Diamond solitaires so big it damn near broke my ear
Girl you ridin with LaFlare so what you got to fear?
2010 no mo' Rolls Royces, I'm just coppin Lear

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Jazze Pha, Gucci, know they didn't expect this (Phizzle!)
It ain't no secret, run up on me you'll regret it
I'm like a ball player, focused on my next hit
And I hit homeruns, I don't know how to bunt bitch
And this that Cali kush you need to pass the blunt bitch
I'm sorry that I cussed you baby girl you're gorgeous
Psych you're not gorgeous but your ass is enormous
And if you never call me I'll be rich regardless
Picture perfect flow, this verse here is a portrait
I got three mansions but I'm from Sunvale Apartments
Bouldercrest, Flare shows in Grisham where I started
You wanna fight me bitch just keep ridin down Moreland

[Chorus]

[Outro: Jazze Pha]
Motion picture shit daddy!
It's Gucci Mane, Mane!
Not the motherfuckin local, not the tennis shoe
Mane! The Gucci motherfuckin Mane
Ya underdig? Phizzle Burgundy
Obama Luther King Junior
Jackson Five the First, ya undersmell?
GUCCI BITCHES~!</pre>
