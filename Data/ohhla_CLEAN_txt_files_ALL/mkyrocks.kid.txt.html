[Chorus (scratched)]
I-I-I'm Mikey
I-I-I rock
I-I-I'm Mikey
I-I-I rock

Hold the phone like a call on the other line
I'm on the phone with a bone of another kind
So hold on, we could roll to the other side
Side of my dome is a zone you could never find
Grip hand, you might need assistance
Trying to find where you are inside of my head
Stay in line, single file if you can
Then we can kick it like kickstands and
You know I peddle to the chain slip
So fly propellers propel us to the angels
Repelling the fellas that's jealous of the name
It's repelling to rappers as soon as I stage hit
So one, two, one, two, mike check
I'm out for high end, EQ my steps
I don't use bad grammar so please excuse this
I'm just trying to let niggas know who I is

[Chorus (scratched)]

Mission complete for all those who don't know
Sienara to afros and old flows
The concept of rocking shows is so old
Just keep them off the wall like Vans logos
Pull it together the spare change and hobos
Cause if you got change in your pocket
Then instantly the dames start flocking
And if you'll show me to the stage (I rock) it
Yes that song request,
All I need is a mic and Inglish
Drop the beat all right I proceed to spit
Me and the beat start fighting with the snares and kicks
Now it's a riot on the track
Reason why is cause I'm fire and I'm hired to do that
And I'm fire cause I'm liver then the wire that was tired
Brought back from the dead
Let it rest on your head
(If you don't know who he is, it's...)

[Chorus (scratched)]</pre>
