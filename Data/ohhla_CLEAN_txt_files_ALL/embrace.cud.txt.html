Ix-nay on the bullshit man
When I roll back to Cleveland
I can't believe them
Sounds of the nonbelievers, outcasts
Till I'm in dirt before it did hurt
Now I can overstand how you could dismiss and front on
Ask me how I feel about the ones with closed eyes
My words how I feel exactly
Aw, fuck, that
I don't give a damn about "ne" one
Hater talkin' down
Don't be afraid at all y'all
All I ask of y'all, is to please:

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' me, me
Please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

[KiD CuDi]
See I must tell you all now
Keep on acting funny
Who am me?
I am here to change that
How you're thinking of them and it's startin'
I am here to show you how it feels to be new
Look at what I made you god to teach you
Honest been insecure cool and you are cool
Brought a heavy, heavy amount some
Malarkey mixed with carbide
Sorry to admit it, dawg
Don't be afraid at all y'all
All I ask about y'all is to please:

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' me, me
Please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds
Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' me, me
Please, embrace the martian

[KiD CuDi]
Licensed to ill
I promise I won't turn the whole world to "Cloverfield"
On the real, yeah I will
I'll destroy it and then rebuild
Just for thrills
Sometimes you got to do it
Sometimes you show the tough love
No one is above what you are here and now dude
No matter who else included
I'm saluted, I'm saluted (Yeah)
No matter who else included
I'm saluted(Yeah, yeah)
I'm saluted...
Oh, whether you appeal, or not
This is the real
Real recognized real
You, you are me
Like it or not
And I, I am you-ooh-ooh-ohh

[Chorus: KiD CuDi] (Repeat 2x)
Embrace the martian
Embrace the martian
I come in peace
But I need y'all rockin' me, me
Please, embrace the martian
And this is how it sounds

[KiD CuDi]
Ooooh!
Ooooh!
And this is how it sounds
In my mind
Oooooh!</pre>
