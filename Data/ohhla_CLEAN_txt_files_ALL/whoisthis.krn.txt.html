(*talking*)
Man who is this calling me, uggh man
 
[K-Rino]
Hello (is this K?), yeah who is this
(we ain't never met before playboy, my name is Chris
I don't know what's going on, but I figured I'd take the risk
I got your number from Cynthia's phone contact list)
Homeboy is you serious, why you calling me then
This sounds like a conversation, you and her need to be in
See insecure dudes like you, let women drive em
(if I find out where you at, I promise it's gon' be a problem)
Ahh man, is the part where I'm suppose to panic (yeah)
You talking to a grown man boy, skip the semantics
(what?) nevermind, let's talk and get it clear
(ain't nothing to talk about, we been engaged for a year)
Well if that's the case, I suggest that y'all should get therapy
Secondly lower your voice, cause all that loudness ain't scaring me
And although, you wasn't aware of me
If my name and number's in her phone, apparently it was saved there voluntarily
 
[Hook - 2x]
Holding those feelings
Are clouded, by what I know now
 
[K-Rino]
(I kinda see your point, but man you don't know what I go through
Why you pushing up on my girl?), dude I don't even know you
But like a fool, I'm sitting on this phone, doing a interview
So I'ma tell you straight, since I've known her she's never mentioned you
(you lying), so tell me who got it twisted
Before this phone call, I never knew that you existed
I know your heart's broke, but checking me was too raw
Don't charge me up about it, I'm just as suprised as you are
And man, I ain't comfortable with this conversation
Because I know what it's coming to, is a confrontation
We all been in love, so I feel your passion brah
But see you asking me questions, you should be asking her
She your woman not mine, that's if you choose to go back
(how many times did y'all...), brah you don't wanna know that (ughh)
I'm trying to be diplomatic, and spare you from the torture kid
Because it's evident, that you don't know her like you thought you did
(I gave her everything, promised I would carry her)
Well all I guess that I can say to you, is don't marry her
Or maybe you should look at yourself, instead of flip out
And figure out what you did wrong, to make her dip out
 
[Hook - 2x]
 
[K-Rino]
You need to man up and try to get over this, (I'm trying)
See once you...hold up...time out, are you crying
Is it that for real, (I'll do anything to get her back) wow
But it's 2:43 in the morning, where is she at now
(I figured she was staying with you), naw she ain't over here
(how do I know what you saying is true)
Well number one, you should of played it by that old school rule
Always check the woman fool, never check the dude
What you doing now is dangerous, it's a shame that I'm explaining this
I can't believe, I'm even entertaining this
Your action proves who's the man, when she make it home
Square it off with her, let her know but just don't use your hands
In life you gotta understand things, (what?)
One man's woman, is another man's fling
And in closing, I'm hoping you handle this like a grown up
Cause I got better thangs to do, so I'ma hang this phone up
