[Lil' Kim]
Yeah, this is ladies night, once again it's on
Your man actin' up, then leave him home
It's the girl of the industry, called the rap Madonna
More dangerous than a tank full of piranhas
Courvoisier in my left arm, glass in my other hand
While I rock that coochie like a rubber band
I'm feelin' sexy in my million dollar Vicki bra
Ay yo Beycone, how you feelin' ma

[Beyonce]
I'm feelin' sexy, I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me, you can feel my burning flame
I'm feelin' kinda N-A-S-T-Y I just wanna take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just taking over me (ah)
I start feeling so crazy babe
Lately, a feelin' been coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feeling so crazy, babe

[Beyonce]
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl, uh
I'm callin' all the girls
We goin' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
Like callin' all the girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

[Beyonce]
You're so sexy, tonight I am all yours boy
The way your body moves across the floor boy
I'm feelin' kinda N-A-S-T-Y I just wanna take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just taking over me (ah)
I start feeling so crazy babe
Lately, a feelin' been coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feeling so crazy, babe

[Beyonce]
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl, uh, oh
I'm callin' all the girls, oh
We goin' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
Like callin' all the girls, oh
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

[Beyonce]
I love to love you baby, I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby, I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby, I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby, I love to love you baby

[Lil' Kim]
You know I rep the style when I chef the pie
I'm back in the kitchen with the flame on high
I see you lookin', baby what's cookin'
Yeah, I'm lookin' like somethin' to eat
Your man there lookin' like somethin' to freak
Lickin' on his lips like I'm somethin' sweet
Lil' Kim and Beyonce just tryin' to keep the flame lit
And warm it up like Big Daddy Kane did

[Beyonce]
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl, uh
I'm callin' all the girls
We goin' turn this party out
I know you want my body, yeah
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
Like callin' all the girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party</pre>
