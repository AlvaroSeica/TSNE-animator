[Propaganda]
Slang came from a land where they suffer from the effects
of depravity like gang bangin and earthquakes
Most famous no namers split a brain and plant a taste
for the King of kings - I know it's a strange concept
Pedalin redemption boy what more can I say? Make me and Lecrae
Been trying to make him famous since ninety three
Fillin these fifty-eights with phrases
that would deem us unfit to succeed among these heathens
It's so crucial in the belly of the crucible
that you would understand that stage like your morning candle
It's handin out cancer that's why fame was never the aim
and the back is the front homey left side up!
That's a concept

Misconception
Those deadly habits have me losin my cool
It's what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated

[Braille]
So many mis... conceptions missin the mark
mis-directed drivin reckless and aggressive
Fueled by our false perceptions
our methods need corrections
Spittin venom in their face and violate
the ones we should protect it's an attempt to motivate
Neglect our obligations place the blame on someone else
point out the flaws in other people and take the focus off ourselves
Those who have been abused view leadership as illegitimate
so they don't think it's necessary to play by the rules or submit
They see authority as nothin more than a power trip 
they don't want to be plugged into it
They'd rather see that power stripped 
get it? Power strip... it's unfortunate
Disproportionate the door is wide open
for false teachers to twist the truth and distort it
No examples left to follow left to our demise actin foolish
but can't see it so we're wise in our own eyes
The life and crucifixion of Christ
is a beautiful depiction of service and submission within a leadership position

[Odd Thomas]
You probably have it all figured out, right?
Like your the type that believes that if you act right
then that just might make you righteous in God's sight
You've been a really good person
you followed the good book as much as you could
you probably didn't go to church as much as you should
but it's all good
I mean you never really killed anybody
never really steal from anybody
you never lusted much, or did much, touching of any bodies
You never use the Lord's name in vain, and you respect you neighbor
you try to maintain peace, love your enemies and not hold on to anger
You really believe that you could receive God's favor
by your good deeds and right behavior
But you're dead in your transgressions and need a savior
Cause you could never win God's approval with the removal of sinful discretions 
your righteous acts of removing God's wrath is in fact the biggest misconception

[Lecrae]
Since my conception I've been riddled with deception
Televised lies devised to lead a blind insurrection
Against the resurrection - and the greatest misconception
the world believes the Christian is foolish without direction
And they knock it they knock it but what does it profit a prophet
to be socially ostracizing no we ain't stoppin the mocking
But if there is anything I can do to raise the stock
in the market for a Biblical worldview then there's no longer an option
Here with the humble beast, ain't no subtleties
Ain't no tongue in cheek, this is what I mean
They don't understand anything about the faith I believe
and they want to belittle me - but it's cool though
They just know the pseudo, the fake faith
the false one, the western God that's man made
not the biblical awesome, toss 'em
Pick up "The Reasons for God" by Timothy Keller and read it
There is a God you should believe in and his name is Jesus </pre>
