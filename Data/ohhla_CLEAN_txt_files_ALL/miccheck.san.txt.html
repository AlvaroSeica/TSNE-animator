[Juelz Santana]
I been paying attention to what's going on out there man (yep)
I been watching you niggaz stealing my ways and shit (uh-huh)
And it's getting out of control now (out of control)
I'ma start telling you niggaz like I tell my bitches (listen)
Don't watch me, watch TV
This is pay-per-view nigga, you gotta pay for this
Ay!

[Verse 1]
First, let me take time to brush my shoulders off
Wait...I had to dust my shoulders off
Thanks, y'all been waiting, been patient, been anxious
Now I herefore bring back me, your greatness (yes)
The rap +Ali+, jab I weave
Then come back with the same jab times three
I blow smoke to the heaven 
I'm so dope it's a weapon
Rap's one big casino, I'm plotting +Ocean's Eleven+ (ay)
I might have sold the least
But I still manage to be most feared by most emcees (good)
Who dope as me
Who close to me
For sho papi, nobody yeah that's how it's supposed to be
Now listen you can either comprehend it or compliment it
It's all authentic (yep)
But you better believe whatever I say
No homo, you can bet ya balls I meant it (ay)

[Hook]
Mic check one two one two (one two)
Mic check one two one two (one two)
Mic check one two what is this
Santana's back to business, let's go (ay)
Mic check one two one two (check)
Mic check one two one two (check)
Mic check one two what is this
Santana's back to business, let's go

[Verse 2]
Bad news, rap dudes, I'm back fools
Get it thrown up, this is that jack move (jack move)
+Ha-choo+, I just sneezed and the track moved (ha-choo)
+God blessed me+, yes that's true
So bright, throw lights up for me
For life married the game, throw rice up for me (yes)
So nice, throw ice up for me (yes)
Two pieces for +B.I.G.+ and one piece for tha kid (yes)
I am back like cooked crack yep
Even my connect asked me how I cooked that up
I told him a brick of me is equivalent to fifty ki's
Broken down, sold around your inner city streets
If you catch me sexing a chick, it's a biseuxal chick 
Or something far and i'll never forget
Yes i'm tha shit bet i'm tha shit
How much lay it down
Whatever you bet I got it covered

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Shh homie quick homie
Get a camera get a flick (yes)
Get a load of this homie
The fifth's on me say something the fifth's off me
Aim, ready to bust, damn the fifth's horny
The album's done, which mean the album's coming
Spent a while but fuck it
This time around I'm fronting
I done styled and stunted
I done wild in public
I done paid my dues, did my hundred miles and running
Now I'm back (ay) like raw cocaine
Put in a pot with water and soda then thrown on flames
And look what came out was me yes
Crack in the flesh at it's best
So hot, won't stop, don't knock me
Dough stocked, don't watch, don't copy
Stones, rocks, froze blocks, so cocky
Hoes watch, hoes jock, go papi (ay)
