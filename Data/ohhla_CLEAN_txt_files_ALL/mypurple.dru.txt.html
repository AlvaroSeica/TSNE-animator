Yeah
You know I had to do this one
I dedicate this
To everybody in the world that smokes purple
And everybody at the canibus clubs that supply it
This one's for you

(Verse 1)
You're my super saucy dragonfly
Purple, purple
How keep a player so high
I used for have a fetish
For them light green eyes
But since I met you
All I want is purple in my life
You my life and the lover
No one 
I put you in the air
And never put nothin' above ya
Who needs a strawberry
Blunt, when you got a bag of grapes
I zig zag
Through traffic to take you on a date
I remember when I first met you
The sweet scent of your perfume
Filled the room, and I just had to get you
And make you mine
It all started with a casual kiss
Then came a twist
I got obsessed, and got attached, and started tearin' from the wrist
I drove for miles in a bucket, just to come and pick you up
When was stranded down in Amsterdam, at the club, stuck
Everyday, I had to see you, you're the girl that I admire
Everybody wanna hit it, dragonfly, you on fire

Chorus:
Come take a hit of my
Purple
And just
Relax
Off the sac
And some 'nac

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
She got a green
Daddy named Urkel, and a mama named Cream
She got a brother named Barney that likes to party with my team
I weighed her up on the triple beam
And it seems
She lost weight, but wait, she still the girl of my dreams
You're my Purple People Eater
Canibus club diva
With ya zodiac signs and (???) us a diva
I used to mess around with those Mexican mamacitas
Til I ran into my super saucy purple prize eater
Even with my cost, but you always give me a lift
Cause you my princess, my sweet passion, my God's gift
Everytime I see you, I just wanna bone you, girl
You so fly, I wanna comb you, girl

Repeat Chorus Four Times

[Singer]
Come take a hit of my purple</pre>
