[Verse 1]
To be known as the best I make a run for it
Ready for war, I got my guns for it
Who dies? All dies (Everyone)
Label (Day By Day), music (MF DOOM)
The Supervillain and Superhero
Burning tracks like we pyros
Laid to wax, radio blaze them
MF Grimm's back, it amaze them
The Fingers of Metal prepare the menu
Go for the jugular, that's what my pen do
Smother my foes, that's what my flows do
Masses of zeros, that's what it grows to
So get the fuck out the path, you're interfering
Or feel the wrath by disappearing
I attack the track the way I want to
You don't like my style then straight up fuck you
My world don't revolve around you
There's other people besides you
Can't stop me this is what I do
Repeat the chorus then I am through

[Chorus]
To be known as the best I make a run for it
Ready for war I got guns for it
Shoot to the top I'm gonna get there
Mad Flow no one compares
To be known as the best I make a run for it
Ready for war I got guns for it
Shoot to the top I'm gonna get there
Mad Flow no one compares

Who dies? All die
War paint
The war paint
The war paint
The war paint
Day By Day Entertainment, we out</pre>
