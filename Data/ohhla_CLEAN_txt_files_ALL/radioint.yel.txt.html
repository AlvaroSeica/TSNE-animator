[Intro: computerized voice]
"The United States Army has issued a warning:
Three nuclear bombs have been launched from North Korea
and will hit Orlando, Florida, Las Vegas, Nevada, and New York City, New York
This will expire at 5 o'clock a.m. Eastern Standard Time
Please get to an underground shelter or a fallout shelter immediately
Once again, three nuclear bombs have been launched from North Korea
and will hit Orlando, Florida, Las Vegas, Nevada, and New York city, New York
This warning will expire at 5 o'clock a.m. eastern standard time
 
[Yelawolf]
I am, I am The American Eagle, eyes of a sparrow
Right hand branch, left hand arrow
Chasing a dollar, in an Impala
White Trash, heart-throb, Mellow Yellow
Drinkin hard liquor, broads get on my level
I'm hotter than the bottom side of of a whistlin kettle
They threw a mountain at me, I got hit with a pebble
They sent me to Hell and I SHIT on the devil
Tried to bury my Chevy box but I won't buckle
Hey that's a deep hole bitch, bring a long shovel
I'm long gone, I'm grown-up and I'm gon' cut you
Wit a chrome blade if you wanna play then homes, fuck you
FUCK you 'til you can't take a shit!
Yea, I'ma fuck everybody tsunami, better anchor the ship
And aim for the ankles and wrists, I came for the dangerous shit
I claim to be named for the hits, the game is a chain that I grip
Slain from the pain of a trip it took to see Wayne in a whip
I became what I came to get the change for the the change I give
A quarter for your thoughts, 'preciate the contribution
Slumerican, I depreciate the the Constitution
Alleviate the crew when, I leave a page a ruins
To each his own I guess I own each and every room in
The house I built is full of hopes no "ifs"
So I stand with a giant like a king, no stilts
If I'm generation X, I'm sellin X, no pills
Dope man choppin up lines ya don't sniff - you read 'em
I'm bringin back booklets and hookless lyrics
So you can be certain just in case you didn't hear it
The "what he say's", "come agains", "what is that"
Come to Earth, touchdown~! I might be your running back
Because you holler'd "run it back"
Stay cool enough to wear toboggan's as a summer hat
Steady on the drum I rap, hope there's no one under that
Rock that I roll, mosh-pit thow'd
Girls on ya shoulders get topless at the shows
Fuck your mop and glow, can't mop a dirt road
It only makes mud, raised around deer, I know how to chase bucks
Baby sitter 16 taught me how to make fuck - at 7
I been raisin hell so I can make it to heaven
Pick up a 2 liter but I only need the plastic
Know how to make bombs with aluminum &amp; acid
Butterfly effect of a hurricane's magic
A tornado path in, the rear view mirror of my '87 Classic
I'm talkin 'bout Gadsden, look Mama no hands, I'm Radioactive {*echoes*}</pre>
