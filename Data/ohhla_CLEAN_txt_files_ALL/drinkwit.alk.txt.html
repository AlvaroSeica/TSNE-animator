First of all, my rhymes be hurtin y'all
Try to step up, you be the first fo fall
I've been lovin Iceman, ever since I seen George Gervin ball
You so broken when you die yo', hearse'll stall
So weak you probably the worst of all
Bullshit MC's I motherfuckin curse 'em all
Like my Nikes white like them birds that don't even chirp at all
Alkaholiks nurture y'all, hip-hop babies, burpin y'all
I'm on my motherfuckin thousandth curtain call
Won't go pop, but I burst the ball, I crash the party
When you hear J-Ro hit the earth and crawl
Call me J-O-B cause I'm workin y'all

Cheers from the crowd for at least 10 years
Yup, see how it sound when it's bangin in ya ear
E-Swift is here, I love to steer
my big body Coupe from here to there
I grab a beer, but not in the ride
I pull up to the club and I drink outside
You all remember me, dropped "Make Room"
in 1993, the rest is history
Y'all niggaz a mystery, Hardy Boys
Y'all fuckin with the original party boys
Everybody make noise, get rowdy rowdy
Throw elbows if it's overcrowded
Lean back, Tha Liks 'bout to do our thang
If we don't come back we goin out with a bang

Uhh, I like it like this
If you over 21 show me that band on yo' wrist
Cause that band on your hand mean we can twist like Chubby Checker
Blunt so fat you'll need a pyrotech' to get it lit
Yeah, this the way that West coast rock shit
I'm the pilot in the plane, drinkin beer in the cockpit
With three thick dames I party like Rick James
My name is Tash nigga, Rico Swift's my nickname
It's fascinatin, I know y'all niggaz thought
Tha Liks was procrastinatin, but we was crashin Porsches
See niggaz on the way up, see 'em on the way down
That's why our four tour buses hit more cities than Greyhound
Hip-hip hooray, Tha Liks is on the way
I'm like the homey that drops by, and stays all day
We stay funky fresh Tha Liks sip the best
