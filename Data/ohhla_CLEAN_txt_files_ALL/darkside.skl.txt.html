Typed by: trusouldia@yahoo.com

Yeah nigga, peep this.
Take a ride on the darkside, take a ride on the darkside.

As the forewind blows, my mind goes on the trip
But more like a tool when I drop this dope shit
Niggas want me stumped to my lyrics cause they jump
But I'm from that darkside, you know whuts up punk
You up in flames, you bitches I'm from tha D.S
Down South, darkside, it's all good bitch.
I'm like that violent rain that struck the city, Eugene Knight
May the 8th, I put my theory down right
Who gives a fuck I say
There's no explanation for the some of the things 
that happens in the city at night
I seen a nigga ??????
They put the fire out for water electricuted the bitch
They make sure ya dead
Cause that's all that matters to a nigga in the darkside

Chorus
I'm comin for ya
Niggas die on the darkside
I'm comin for ya
Niggas get glocked on the darkside x4

Nigga, now when the lightning strike the thunder always come
Bitch niggas don't even flinch cause if you do you get pistol whipped
I seen a nigga run for his life, from a fist fight
Same nigga lost the fight, got the gat right
That's how it's be in my city
Four hundred and twenty one murders, niggas don't show no pity
You got to be real in the land you live in, punk
Or get handled by them niggas in the darkside chump
I scar, I dwell, where demons have nothing but houghts of murder
Look down, await, body's hangin' out that burner
Aint nothin but murders that kill up around this bitch
That New Orleans city is wicked, that New Orleans city is wicked
Them bitches can't run, them hoes can't hide
Y'all niggas commit suicide in the darkside

Chorus x3</pre>
