[Intro]
LET'S GO

[Juvenile]
J-U, V-E
No breed, no other like me
Fans like is he really gonna drop that?
Point of degree, you ain't never gonna top that
He ain't the same but he still got flow
Guess I gotta flo', just a little bit mo'
It's gonna be a Juvie nation
Call this rejuvenation
It's too much of the fake out
Gotta get the real out 'fore they stake out
Put the kids in the safe house
Cake out, pull the champ and the stakes out
I am my dreams, my plans
Lemme in, lemme in, God damn
Still on, my shit
Lil' nigga what'chu mean? I quit
If you a pit bull, I'm Mike Vick
I'll bury yo' ass right quick

[Chorus]
It's early in the morning, y'all sleepin, I'm moanin
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
It's early in the morning, y'all sleepin, I'm moanin
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
You don't want none, there won't be none
You stop actin like a bitch you won't be one
You don't want none, there won't be none
You stop actin like a bitch you won't be one

[Interlude]
Right now I just wanna say to everybody
that I appreciate the fact that y'all took a little time
out of y'all busy schedule to go out and get the album
And I promise you'll love the sound and the quality of this motherfucker
You understand me? Juve~!

[Juvenile]
N-O, L-A
Niggaz droppin like flies everyday
Who's next? Can't say
Gotta cover my dough, I can't play
Be smart and you could move more weight
Be sharp and you could lose your face
It's like that when they hate you
Gotta show 'em you're a ape too
Handle business in the night and the day too
A big dog in the hood, how they rate you
A beast - like me, I'm G
Real as the Buddha in front of my I.D
M-A, G 3
Watch me, y'all follow my lead
My hood, my scent
I can't leave, it might be in my debt
Watcha mean leave? Nigga, not yet
I ain't ready, I ain't seen my check

[Chorus]

[Outro: impersonating Frank White's speech from "King of New York"]
That's right motherfuckers
I'm back~! Comin for the top, but this guy
You guys got fat while I was away
But I'm back and I want a piece of everything
If any of you guys, are tired of gettin ripped off
by no good motherfuckers like that
You come on down to U.T.P. I'll take care of you
I'll put some cash in your pocket
You're all welcome. You're all welcome!!! {*echoes*}</pre>
