[Intro]
Though many have come
There will never be another one
Quite like, Yela

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
RAHHH! Everybody get the FUCK UP!
RAHHH! Everybody get the FUCK UP!
RAHHH!

[Yelawolf]
Daddy gonna pop that trunk!
Yeah, battleship sunk, throwin dirt clot chunks
Slingshot rocks, broke, no money lumps
Lookin at the D-boys with the pretty dunks
Slick sit down, you ain't in the city chump
Special K make the kitties come
Get'cha some, get many guns
Move 'em out, ten toes down, pity none!
Get your own, Dixie won't give a dog a bone
Sittin on bigger chrome, yeah that's home
Bird fight, Pit fight, what a good song
Lookin at the world like, "What'd I do wrong?"
Nothin but a mailman truck comin back for the pick-up
I'm a gift you can't get rid of
Recline on me homie, I'ma make you sit up
Get drunk, do it! Stage lights are lit up!
SCREAM LIKE!

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
... Let the beat ride like that!
Yeah I'm a thunderbird never comin back
Thunder in the trunk, thunder in the dope sack
I, serve 'em up thunder in the dope raps
BOOM~! Big 'llac's in the tall grass
Sit with the tires flat
Real good price buddy, you should buy that
Blink and you might pass, my town
Hole in the wall king, my crown
Oh but of all things, my sound
is pickin up like a 30-mile long train
Slow climb up but such a long gain
So how did I become a pick of all names?
What a fairy tale like Ichabod Crane
The Headless Horseman runnin untamed like!

[Chorus]</pre>
