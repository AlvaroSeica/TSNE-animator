C'mon I need a hot girl
Really ha I need a wifey
hahahahaha you know what's happening with me though
C'mon keep it real
I'ma keep it real
You understand
You treat me right I'ma treat you right
You dog me I dog you (Fo' show)

[B.G.]
I'm from tha streets
I've been hot all my life
So free bitches and hot girls is all I like
Gotta be raw and jazzy that's my type
And stand behind me if I'm wrond or right
Drive at night
Fight my fight
Rock that pipe
I hit the road come back
It's nice and tight
I get ya what ya want
No matter the price
We get to sit on a Sunday in the Benz or the bike
Reppin' and stuntin'
Shinin' and flossin'
Just ballin'
You got a problem with anything I solve it
you need me call me Geezy there
You could be anywhere girl Geezy there
Keep it real, I keep it real
To the bone I swear
Don't be stingy with that love
Come on and share
You gotta open up, you gotta care
I'ma give ya this love and passion, I swear

[Chorus]
Don't you worry 'bout a damn thing baby
Youe my man and I'm gon' be your lady
I know this biz it'll drive ya crazy
But I'ma give my love only to you
I'ma be right by your side
It's do or die (Only to you)
I got ya back yeah
Baby that's a fact yeah
I I I I'm only for you

[Wyndi]
I'll be always there for you
You know that my heart is true
So boy do what you gotta do
As long as you bring your love home to me
Cause you knoe I give you everything you need
Ummm yeah
You know you got my love
You know you got my trust
I know it is a must
And this is what I guarantee
Forever me and you baby
Your lady
Mmm, always with you
Only for you
Only for you
So don't you worry

[B.G.]
It ain't nothin' in this world
I won't do for my sweetie
You get it whether you want it
Not jus when you need it
I treat ya how ya suppose to and wanna be treated
I ain't talkin' just to be talkin'
I say it, I mean it
I'm hot for you
You know how to please me, then please me
Don't tease me
Let's get off the heezy
Girl I'm fiening
You got Lil' B.Geezy
Tweeking to do ya something
I'm overheating
Please believe me
I guarantee when I'm through
You think you was dreamin' when I'm through
I'ma leave ya something proper
Do ya something nasty
Ooh girl I'ma do ya something nasty
You know how I roll
You know how I get down
you know how I'm from Uptown
You know how I get down
It's the real on that side of the field
You be Bonnie
I be Clyde
Let's hustle and get a mill

[Chorus] - repeat 3X</pre>
