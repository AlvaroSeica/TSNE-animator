she sounds good like the cheeba, I'm very lucky to meet her
I though we falling in love, I stay away from the drama
I meet her at the club, ladies night coco cabana
she said her name was havanna, ima call her havana
she likes nice things, iced out dolce gabbana
long island after long island__ gets wilder
we keep the dance floor side stepping, popping my collar
swear to god the way she back it up made me soooÂ…. bomb

you got the bomb, put me on, I want the bonita applebum
those girls are chicken heads, I don't be chasing after them
kissing on my neck
looking for the plat
gold digging, when you macking them
well, I aint got no money
now whats really happening
folow me as I begin to tell you things you never heard
when that's, that
when she hollers back I grabbed her arm
whispered in her ear ,your all of that
all you want is that you want it from the back
like switches on a cadillac
see I'm an alley cat and I don't want a pet
I want a little pretty someone two rub me on my back
when I hollered at that, she hollered back
I grabbed her arm, I whispered in her ear
you make me so

chorus

follow me as I begin to tell you things you never heard
wall are listening and whispering and opening things
my words are knowledge to the core
as if you opened a gym
I livemy life on the go
live no doubt for the rush
when stress builds pressure
then I let it go on and bust
its been cloudy for months
its getting hard to breathe
(got to get away from the mugged up nigga bob and weave)
mission impossible and blind dare behind the trees
blood boiling, pulsating like its harder to be

she sounds good like the cheeba, I'm very lucky to meet her
I though we falling in love, I stay away from the drama
I meet her at the club, ladies night coco cabana

follow me as I begin to tell you things you never heard
