I don't need brighter days
I just need some faith
You got me walking away now
You got me walking away
You got me walking away now
You got me walking away

It was the year of the witch
Nobody steer clear of the ditch
They say brave when you don't flinch
But we never saw the blade, never had the chance to cringe
Don't ever forget to put misery on the guest list
Sipping on a memory for breakfast
Middle of the party, all alone
You wanna dig up bones but your claws ain't grown
Put your half-empty glass on the coaster
Step backwards slow
Got a sky full of bats circling over the crowd
Your eyes go black when you open your mouth
I'm like, walking on the frozen rain
Wanna claim a block that's got no complaints
But I'm dying in a city called look at me now
Little piggie wanna cook up the cow
I'm like, might as well knock down them walls
When the earthquakes follow you for all your faults
Let the facade fall dead in the fog
While the voices that are inside of your head applaud
I'm like, everyone got a course to fly
Run towards horizon, aim for the sky
So high sleeping under the stars
You outgrew the sum of your parts
I used to run wild like a child of thieves
Now I breathe quiet in a pile of leaves
With a space heater on the back of my porch
for when I take a break from attacking your fort
You said that you want it
But you can't see the center of the web because you're standing on it
Don't wait to escape from the ways you escape
Just throw your hands up and say

You got me walking away now
You got me walking away
You got me walking away now
You got me walking away</pre>
