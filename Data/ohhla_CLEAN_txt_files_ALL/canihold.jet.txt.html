Song:   Can I Hold Your Hand?!
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
Walking, down, the street, again
Life sucks, no friends, no girl, that's me
Two AM, or three, time, is still
Primo Metro phoned me up (add add) me again
Then I met you

[Chorus]
Can I hold your hand?
Just let me inside, inside of your brain
Just for this night
You, have captured my heart
We'll never be apart
Just stick out your hand, and let's...

[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
Again, again, once again
Those eyes, win, again
I'm hooked, and, she knows
God, please, let, me know (just send me a sign)

[Chorus]</pre>
