[CHORUS 1]
met a girl by the name of miss fortune
her daddy was a very rich man
told me "son proceed with caution
if you wanna take my little girls hand
see the money that I have might be good for some
its downright danger to another
and little miss fortune is sure to become
unfortunately just like her mother

"you see back when I was young and dumb, I had a choice
before me and mama fortune got wed
between riding in a bus or driving a new rolls rice, yeah
and I decided what I wanted was the bread

"but the problem with having everything you want
is you never really know what you need, hey
now miss fortune is this bored little debutant, and its my fault
so I suggest you take my heed

[CHORUS 2]
"so you met my little girl miss fortune
and you know that I'm a very rich man
i told you to proceed with caution
if you wanna take my little girls hand
see the money that I have might be good for some
its downright danger to another
and little miss fortune is sure to become
unfortunately just like her mother"

hey, well I thanked miss fortunes father, said, I understand
but youre tryin to talk me down, yes you are
listen here you aint have to brother, cuz I'm a real strong man
im sure I could turn your daughter around

see what she needs is someone who can take control
let the girl know her place and how to play her role
tell her all the money in the world cannot replace her soul
and she need to stop acting like shes 12 years old

when she put the ring on her finger, everything started to change
and I looked at myself in the mirror, and oh I was looking strange
she had me out everyday spending money, and all kinds of ridiculous things
see I forgot what life was all about, little miss fortune was to blame

[CHORUS 3]
so I married this girl miss fortune
and his daddy was a very rich man
and even though he told me take caution
i still took his little girls hand
see money dont do everybody the same
and its downright danger to a brother
and little miss fortune surely became
unfortunately just like her mother, hey

you gotta watch out for miss fortune
brothers you must proceed with caution
dont let lady luck pass you by
whoah, might as well give good grace a try

all I wanted was a little dance with lady luck but
she wont give me a chance
and what I could use is some good old grace
but she refuses to show her face
all I wanted was a little dance with lady luck but
she wont give me a chance
and what I could use is some good old grace
but she refuses to show her face

miss fortune, miss fortune</pre>
