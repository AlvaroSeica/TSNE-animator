[Verse 1]
"Jesse you're a wigger
Put your hat on straight
Your pants are getting bigger?
Still in that rapping phase?
Your earring isn't cute
Why'd you shave your head?
Is that your dad's suit?"
Bitch, my dad's dead
They try to give me shit
They don't know what's in me, shit
A fire burnin
Smoke comin' out my mouth
I'm on some chimney shit
Coaches had jokes
Teachers had jokes
Parents had jokes
Pack your bags folks and back off
My pants gone sag and I ain't takin my hat off
"Yo, you look like Asher Roth"
Hilarious. Mazel tov.
Should I complain?
"They're mean and rude"
Should I refrain from stayin true?
Should I behave the same as you?
What's lacrosse?
Who's Dave Matthews?
I didn't have two parents whose style I could inherit
So I cherished independence
Found merit in my spirit of rebelliousness
So listen close when I tell you this
Your opinions about my way of life they really don't mean shit

[Hook]
When I was a kid I ain't never fit in
And no matter what I did people said I was wrong
But I ain't throw a fit, I ain't really give a shit
Only thing that I said was back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Don't worry bout me, just worry bout you
And back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off


[Verse 2]
"Jesse you've got money
And you're from Manhattan
You're probably just a yuppy who wants to try his hand at rappin
Jump off the bandwagon
You're fake, a disgrace
Whatchu know about the struggle?"
Aright, listen up shitface
First off, life ain't about the surface, it's bout what's underneath
Second, take a second, learn about me before you suck your teeth
Yeah I got dough
Wallet ain't delgado
I work for all my guap though
Oh my God, bro
Back off
I bust my ass for everything I got, you jack off
"Yo, you're probably mad soft"
Shit like that I laugh off
No point in comparing you and me
What, you mad about the UMA?
Truthfully that lunacy wasn't new to me

[Hook]
When I was a kid I ain't never fit in
And no matter what I did people said I was wrong
But I ain't throw a fit, I ain't really give a shit
Only thing that I said was back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Don't worry bout me, just worry bout you
And back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off

[Verse 3]
"Jesse you're annoying
Promote yourself too much
I'm over here enjoying twitter at my job at lunch
And you just keep on yappin
Blah blah, rappin rappin
I unfollowed you by accident"
Oh, that's what happened?
What
I'm gonna make an album and not tell heads about it?
Whisper it, not shout it?
Picture it, I doubt it
Blogs have red tape
"You should sound like Blu's tape"
"New York needs a purple tape"
Help good music circulate or back off
Lose that badge &amp; take your journalist mask off
"It's my opinion, that's all"
Most of y'all are mascots
Ok, look I'm an artist who is happy making art
Some websites just copy paste
and in their haste they're breaking hearts
But me, I just wanna write
Record some shit and share it
I don't care if I make carrots
Just want you to hear it
People ask me,

"Jesse, what are you tryin to do with this music shit?"
Umm, I'm tryin to make some music, shit

[Hook]
When I was a kid I ain't never fit in
And no matter what I did people said I was wrong
But I ain't throw a fit, I ain't really give a shit
Only thing that I said was back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Don't worry bout me, just worry bout you
And back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off
Back off</pre>
