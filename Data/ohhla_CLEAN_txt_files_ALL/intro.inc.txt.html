And toast and that fo' automatic
And dough gotta have it and my niggaz blastin
Gloves and ski mask's when it's time put the match in
We cock and bust, rags, is what's happenin
Livin like a gangsta so gangsta shit I'm rappin
While y'all niggaz is actin, stick to the script
Hold ya hip wit a clip
Ain't no love for the snitch
Only slugs from the fifth leave you stiff

Becomes somethin that you don't want cousin

Whoever face my clique
Gon get erased, in this thing violence and sick
Nigga hard to break yourself

The fire bomb, when the war is on

And if you ain't know thats the boss man runnin the show
So get your weight up if you hate us enough
To come lace us pull out your gun and bust it
Man enough if you ain't bluffin
