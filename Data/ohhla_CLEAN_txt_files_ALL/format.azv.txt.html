You know the chronicles, the shit that if mama knew
The stress the drama do
The tecs phemonenal
Rapid fire, pecks through the abdominal
You bastard liars, it's me whos the honorable
Bathed and clothed up, shaved and close cut
Restraint from temptation was drained from both nuts
Now in the physical form
Verbalize through the scriptures I was biblically born
It's I'ah, Jeremiah the seed through the blunt fire
On Kawasaki's, can wheelie up on one tire
Well respected, jail connected
Got the method for the pretty females perfected
For sure, very few flaws, heavy Chevy 2 doors
Candy paint'll give the nigga the blue balls
Pause, this the life I chose
The ?, the 360, the ciphers closed

[Chorus]

Young and gifted, my tongues prolific
In the beach bungalow is how I brung in Christmas
For the streets I'm going flow from the hungriest districts
Swiss kicks crisp when I come to them picnics
Play slow, paper chase stack and lay low
Range rove tinted all black the same old
Psychic mind, righteous rhymes the ? turned a new leaf on my life on crime
No concerns with new beef, who's as nice as I'm
Is ?for few feet, I'm still a sniper blind
Built my fame, spilt my pain
Politicking daily, still trying to milk the game
It's obvious I'm real rap, skills remain
Took some change and I'm still the same

[Chorus]

Learnt the system, burned some izm
Tied all my jewels down like journalism
How I maneuve now it'll merge the wisdom
A pilgrim, prophesize putting words to rhythm
Relating, I'm adaplating it, manifestation, patient, meditating with the
manner who's waiting, pacing
Like an inmate that sealed his fate
let some years escape but I'm still in shape
I'm chilling deeply rooted
A beast with music, from bedstuy to the east I'm to at peace to lose it
But love it, I still does it
Breathing off a trump budget
Fresh out of bloomies with the Louie luggage</pre>
