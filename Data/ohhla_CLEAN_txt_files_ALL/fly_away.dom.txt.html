[Intro: Dom Pachino]
I just wanna fly... just wanna fly away
Man, I just wanna fly...

[Dom Pachino]
Give me some wings, I'm through with the material things
Explore the earth, it was meant for a king
Open your mind, you see all these beautiful things
Like the trees, and the birds, and the bees, and the blue sea
The sky and the clouds, sometimes I sit and wonder how, people live so foul
You can rob an old lady and take food from a child
If that's a thug, then dude, I ain't feeling ya style
Here's some jewels, you can use, if you choose
But if you choose not to use these jewels, you a fool
You'll be left with nothing, talking bout 'P, can I hold something?'
But you couldn't even hold substance
Yeah, you quote a few scriptures, but you can't even see the big picture
You caught in the devil's lasso, chilling with ya
In front of ya building, while you slinging to children, it's ya people you killing
And you ain't even making close to a million
So tell me why the fuck are you dealing?
You making diaper money, but, you buy cigarettes
Your girl's in need of loving, but you giving her sex
Invite other women to your bedroom? Make your shit complex, look
You not out of line, dude, you out of the textbook

[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino]
Please, let me fly, I just wanna fly away
So I can see a brighter day
Please, let me fly, it looks kinda gloomy outside
I need a place where I can hide away

[Dom Pachino]
Let's talk about the sun, moon and the stars
Not about the sex, drugs, money and cars
That's the illusion, that got my people trapped behind bars
Not even time gon' heal they scars
Not even my rhymes with my hooks and bars
Yeah, I give 'em food for thought, something they can eat with they mind
I paint the picture, hope they can digest the design
It might take some time but, if they search for them true selves, then they shall find
Be you, I see you, I keep your ass in mind
See I'mma fly away, even though I know I'm gonna die some day
Watch me cross the road, I got the right-of-way
I just wanna search for a brighter day, go...

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: sample]
Let the music take your mind...
Just release and you will find...
Your gonna fly away...</pre>
