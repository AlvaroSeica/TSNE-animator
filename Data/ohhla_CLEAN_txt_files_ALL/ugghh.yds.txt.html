Nigga turn ya head if you got a weak tummy
Cause Eazy eat rappers, eat money ummm yummy
Get ya hands off my style, you's a clepto
Shit on everybody outside, I need pepo
Now can you stand the rain, its the new edition
I was known for grindin on a block yup pitchin
Shawty wit me strapped, you can say the kid armor
I'm ralph lauren down like I'm fresh outta harvard (Daaammnnn)
White tee and some jeans, dats my costume
Niggaz see my ears and had to run to the bathroom
I'm on 1 like past noon, my car hot like last june
All the haters go

[Chorus]

[Young Deuces]
Ugghh!! I left dem haters sick

Ima fool wit da whip, got dem presidential tints
My pockets stay full you aint never seein lent
I'm all about my money dawg my bank account is lovely
