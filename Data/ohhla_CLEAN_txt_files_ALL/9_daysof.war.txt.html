[Intro: movie sample]
Get out of here you dig old bastard
Go on get your ass out of here
*machine gun fire*
*man panting and moaning*
*baby crying*

[Chorus 2X: Warcloud]
I love rap like the young lady over laughing
I watch a cockroach on the white door frozen daiquiri athlete

[Warcloud]
Aiyo, I Charley twenty seven of you raps soldier's torpedoes
Gun flame Banditos, leak you, slump you finito
Chronicles and memoirs, coconut Pontremolli man
Like a dead horse pump a Tomahawk 'til the drama stop
Then I'ma walk, yo everything is yo
Exotic, bionic like 'Winter of Red Snow'
Library of old maps, radios and Nik Naks
Drink of spring water, the King slaughtered in horror
Pocket full of trail mix, apple chips and naval ships
Gave a girl a wink and went upstairs to drink
Call them Alcatraz, Big Warcloud, Alcatraz, Alcatraz
Shuffle gun powder barrel but furrow
Hit by a thousand dipped arrows and million spears
Died standing up, he appears to swig beers
Clap and overlap you Cash Rules I stash jewels
Read books like Matthew's, shatter you like glass statues
Baffling whores is in this healthiest caper
It's like tropical birds and reading the mornings paper
The news is printed on cheap wood
So you don't have to pay very much for your paper
At sunrise, eighty eight shots that bust your gut with one rhyme
Medicine balls, gymnasium rap is bloody fun time

[Chorus 2X]

[Warcloud]
Aiyo, 'The Long Walk Home', haywire, bent over elderly
Hammerhead Shark Men, Tiger Men, my Bible pen
Floats a bloody spiralling nightmare, prescribe you gin
Blend like Biggie, Iguanas, blues and reds
All shades of grey, crystal waters, my pistol slaughters
Missiles auto crash your shack this time tomorrow
Horror show flow, swivel nose dough that's part cheesy
Tear you spine out then climb out the bar as easy
See we like to murder rappers, drink heavy liquor and fall out
Bad Brooklyn bitches, them chicks stay in the door house
Brawl out, L.A. coke sniffing the greediest
Rhymes are like elephant graveyards, mischievous
I keep you with a heart full of slugs like a Low Life
Catch me getting drunk on the hood of a Classic Chevy
Cruising, I keep your eye bruising
You get pummelled in the tunnel when we rumble
then I stumble swigging my booze in
Bounce over here 'cause everyday is ____
1313 Mockingbird Lane
Chronicles of beautiful musicals try to disarm me
I stomp through your Gingerbread Army, ____ choppy
Classic old Chevy's we sky lining like Speedball
I feed my battle raps a velvet box of Lady Fingers</pre>
