Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus]
You're all I got, I'm all you need
How you can always call on me
Even when you're doin wrong
You never have to fight alone
I'll pick you up when you fall down
Through thick and thin I'll be around
Whatever the case may be
Don't hesitate to call on me

[CL Smooth]
To get my momma fed up and tell me to bounce
Still in high school, sleepin on grandma's couch
Just a crack dealer, young hood lovin the street
I'm on a mission and I will not accept defeat
I'm just another kid lost with the most potential
The physical is easy, the challenge is mental
Will you make the right choice and clean your act up
or make them itchy trigger fingers call for backup?
When you get a second chance, few will get one
Still with the love of your people adapt son
You need to be proud of me, I kept my promise
A mother like Afeni Shakur, Voletta Wallace
Forever wantin their sons like grandma grieves for my Uncle Doc
It's like nothin else can fill that spot
When I was lost you saved me
And all that real tough love you gave me, I can hear you sayin

[Chorus]

[CL Smooth]
I'm so on top of my game and have it all
Who would ever think one day I'd lose it all?
Liquidate cars, auction off my castle
We always stayed tight, now it all unravels
My woman up and leave me, my kids in different states
Can't rock tears cause I'm cold and my heart aches
The world must think I'm at my lowest point now
Stripped me down and show me who run the joint now
But there you were when they wanna impale me
Never out of pity though, never could fail me
You knew I could bring somethin back to the table
To see it all blossom like the flowers in April
So if life is a tug of war let's keep pullin
Cause behind every strong man is a strong woman
When I was that lost you saved me
And all that real tough love you gave me, I can hear you sayin

[Chorus]

[CL Smooth]
Here's to the next Betty Shabazz, Coretta Scott King
Maya Angelou, said she wanna be O
Just like the Winfreys, pooches and all
The same way you got my back, big or small
You know the one they always said would be there for ya
Jewelry out the pawn shop, stack for my lawyer
When I was that lost you saved me
And all that real tough love you gave me, I can hear you sayin

[Chorus] - 2X to fade</pre>
