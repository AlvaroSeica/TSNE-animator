[Grand Puba]
Uhh... Alamo head banger
Girls, girls, girls, girls - c'mon and clap your hands
Cause there's some brothers on the mic I know ya like
And they called Brand Nubian
Now girls, girls, girls, girls - girls we do adore
We got no time for the jive, time to get live
Cause you know we keeps it raw

[Sadat X]
When I was smoked out that day you had looked all the better
But homechick tried to dead me, the one you went to school with
The one who never had shit, and always talkin foul shit
And Jenny's just been a crab but as we lay
Hair in disarray, you know that thing that I play with
What are you laughin for girl? Cause I'm serious
What me and you do ain't nobody's business
And I don't see why we have to get into this
Now I can play the villain, as I usually do
When we act as adults we have less insults
Sexual results, rate you as the champ
Send a rose to your wife cause she done saved your life
Put up with cheapness, she mighta took a beating

[Lord Jamar]
Well yo girls, girls, girls, girls - c'mon shout and clap your hands
Cause there's some brothers on the mic I know ya like
And they called Brand Nubian
Well yo girls, girls, girls, girls - girls we do adore
We got no time for the jive, it's time to get live
Cause you know we keeps it rawwwwww

[Grand Puba]
I be the number one freaker, watch me make your whole body weaker
Send a chill from your perm down to your sneakers
Ten cent, I'm diggin how she represent {*sniff*}
Victoria, Apple Ocean body scent
She don't swine, body all dipped in design
Got a mind, them type of joints is hard to find
Let's take a bounce to the Bahamas
Better yet I got mad fam in St. Thomas but I can't promise
Word is bond, shorty love be the baddest
Ass be the fattest, way past {?} Badu status
No big deal baby cause I be the pantie conner
I spit game not +Karen+ go and ask +Donna+
Once the five-one-six hit the bloodstream
I talk shit, watch the nips turn to highbeam
See I'ma make it real saucy, watch the panties get mad glossy
Then get you open like a pot of coffee

[Sadat X]
Aiyyo girls, girls, girls, girls - c'mon and clap ya hands
We got some brothers on the mic I know ya like
And they're called Brand Nubian yeahhhh
I say girls, girls, girls, girls - girls I do adore
Got no time fo' the jive, it's time to get live
And you know we keeps it raw

[Lord Jamar]
Rememberin times when we was swervin
catchin more dimes than Candice Bergen; makin love on a Pesian rug
I be like that sexual drug, that intellectual thug
Makin connections in the club, show affections where to rub
Your complexion's like a Nubian queen, you cruise from Queens
New designer jeans and you puffin on the lime green
Your whole body is a crime scene, under investigation
You wonder will I give a demonstration
I be your ultimate temptation
You waitin for the moment of your penetration
Only to find that it's better than you ever dreamed
It never seems to stop
Am I ever runnin out of steam? No I'm not
I be the last of the red hot lovers
Spankin that ass under the covers
Brand Nubian brothers, don't mistake us for no others
And when it's time to hit we got the rubbers

[Outro: all speaking and overlapping]
Yeah yeah uhh, like that like this
This goes out to all the Wisdom Bodies
Word is bond, glamorous women, knahmsayin
Lookin right, keepin it tight, no spite
And I rolls like that like that like that knahmean?
Word up boy, say it, yeah
Girls, girls, girls, girls
Shit yeah, this goes out to the girls, girls, girls, girls
{*fades out*}</pre>
