Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm a ball for my niggas in the east, and I'm really from the west
I'm a ball for my niggas in the east, and I'm really from the west
I got love for the streets
But I still hold the glock and the heat and I put you on the strip
Like the boys in the d
Fuck what you heard bitch, I'm a grown man
I'm a keep counting money till I'll pass math
Hunned thousand bitch, straight cash
I pop the top off the remi, might said henny
Everytime I sip, henny dip the warm chest
45 and your arm rest, bout a hunned dozen, in the arm rest
Gotta deal with the barber bitch, I'm a push harder
Niggas think it's a game around, till that 44
Lying side and lamb down, I'm a king with the fucking crown
If you feel otherwise you should speak now
You can see whip the get money tactics
Won't push over, I'm aside with the boulders
Walking on the streets, you gonna have the bump shoulders
Niggas never solid, most niggas act closure
My guns clap, like the brand new testarossa
From the shoulders, I am bring you a little closer
Niggas try to turn man, you gonna have to hoe up
Fuck niggas, I pull triggers, I'm a let them blow up
Never wore a mask, you gonn have to expose us
I'm a show my face, no hide, no trace
Pull it in, no state, never, never did
Niggas hold the state, fill em up for ransom
Gun tape and bag em, like twitter, we flag em
200 magnum, go car what I drive by in that magnum
Let me 24 ride of the side of your magnum
Treat them like an ny, don't smash them
Riding through off drough in the streets
Bitch play around with me you gonn go to sleep
No bed by your side when you lay in the sleep
And this gangsterville, off the top, west side, you get murked for real
Worldwide, off top, I'm a push the deal
Lil b all day and he rep the bay
45 in the my coat, you can see the cake
I'm a a bull lile philly where the eagles play
I'm a a bull lile philly where the eagles play, bitch
Lil b nigga, yeah, lil b nigga, 100 000 for the grammy, 100 000 for the weary</pre>
