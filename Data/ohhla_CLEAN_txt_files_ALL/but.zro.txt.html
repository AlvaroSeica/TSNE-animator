[Z-Ro]
I been through enough with you, matter of fact too much with you
And loving you, don't mean I'ma continue to fuck with you
This ain't a fuck you song, this a thank you for not loving me
Causing me to love myself, listen I loved you some
How can I please, somebody that can't be pleased
Ain't nothing left for Z-Ro to do, but leave
Ain't no such thang as a happy home, unless I'm living alone
Even though it ain't your time of the month, your cycle is on
Though I get enough beef, in the streets to eat
When I get to the crib you try to feed it to me, everytime you speak
R. Kelly got you self centered
What about when a brother is fed up, it's hard to keep his head up
See but this the last time, you try to run my life
You wanna run something, become a dyke and get yourself a wife
Me I'ma miss ya, but a size 12 can kick ya where the good Lord split ya
Not trying to diss ya, just telling you why I love ya bitch
 
[Hook]
Thanks for making it hard, to make it better for us
I was just trying to make, some cheddar for us
I'm a one woman man but, when my one woman start tripping
You can find me, where the strippers be stripping
I went out to get it, and I came back with it
Never complained I just handles my bidness, God as my witness
I'm a one woman man but, when my one woman start tripping
You can find me, where the strippers be stripping
 
[Z-Ro]
Just be a lady in the streets, you ain't gotta be a freak in the sheets
Just be respectful, when you speaking to me
They say you never miss a good thang, until it's on it's way out
You should of peeped the signs, when I started to stay out
All night long dodging the call on the phone, not cause I'm cheating
But I'm drinking and chiefing, contemplating if I'm staying or leaving
It ain't no question, if I loved you girl
It's just your attitude, make me wanna hurl
I know I give it to you how you want it, when I'm in you
You just say the word I slow down, change positions and then continue
Then you be acting like you don't know me, when we ain't sexing
I'm in jail stressing, and you mad at me for not showing affection
Pardon me, for being human
If I'm not pleasing you, you got a problem with what I'm doing
Me I'ma miss ya, but a size 12 can kick ya where the good Lord split ya
Not trying to diss ya, just telling you why I love ya bitch

Our relationship faded, I wish we would of made it
I sho' hate it, but I got my sanity back and I wouldn't trade it
For a mill ticket, ain't no maybe we'll kick it
I don't want that, like getting out of prison I'd do anything not to go back
Could it be meant for me, to be one deep
By myself, when I'm awake and when I'm 'sleep
Thanks to you I don't spend no mo' time, trying to please somebody else
Now all my time and effort is put into pleasing me, straight up
I'm gone, and you gon' miss Joe Mac
No use in calling my phone, cause ain't no getting Ro back
I don't wanna go to the movies, or go out to eat
Only way you gon' see me, is if you see me out in the streets
I thought you were my future wife girl
But maybe my experience with you, was preparation for me to find the right girl
Me I'ma miss ya, but a size 12 can kick ya where the good Lord split ya
Not trying to diss ya, just telling you why I love you damn
