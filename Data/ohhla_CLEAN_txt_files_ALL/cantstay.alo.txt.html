Typed by: AZ Lyrics

What does it feel like to do everything you can
For the woman that you love just to be a better man
It feels something like a fat slap in the face
From the woman that you love when she getting on your case
About who you call and who you hanging with
About who when why where what and it
Get on your nerves 'cause you don't need this mess
Get on your nerves 'cause you don't need this stress
Be on your mind all the time like pay checks
Be on your mind all the time like safe sex
Pissing you off 'cause she know you's a grown man
Pissing you off 'cause she don't seem to understand
You need space but she taking up all the room
She sucking up all your space like a vacuum
Just do what I do tell her like this come here
You don't gotta go home, but you can't stay here

Oh, oh, when you go
I will not stop you
You ain't got to go home
But you can't stay here

In particular allow me to explain something
I was trying to be with this lady but she stayed fronting
Spending my money and asking me for this and that
But when I needed money she don't wanna give back
To the cause I had to pause and reflect on it
-But I just let it slide though
Because it felt so good to have her in my ride though
She was the ring master I was just a sideshow
More like a clown but dig the way it went down
I found she was sleeping 'round when I went out of town
I didn't call her for weeks, she hit me up fretting
I told her take your new freak and get to half stepping
She called her cousin told her cousin I was really buggin
She brought her cousin to my house look what the cat drug in
A little pip squeak weak like a wet twig
I told him come back when you get big then I told her

That's the way it is and the way it has to be
It's about time I let me look after me
It could never be ever after happily
If we stay together it will be a catastrophe</pre>
