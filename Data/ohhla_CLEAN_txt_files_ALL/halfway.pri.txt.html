54321 Pow! That's the time to go that's my spaceship signal
Endorphin morphin rushin for touchin
per-cu cu cussion hit it hard hit it rough
What, I blushed
Premillenial gland kickin, perennial antennial kiss me again
Time to leave exit earth spaceship berth, no more hurt
I'll meet you halfway

I'll meet you halfway, I'll meet you halfway
I'll meet you halfway to the sky and the stars
Yo I'll meet you halfway but baby just smile at me
Keep it alright keep it alright keep it alright
I keep it alright

Boy you got me trippin, bleeps blip blip blippin
Hard thinkin drinkin heart kickin
Jaw Slack like a Chicken my mission
Trippin me up flippin me pick-pick- Listen
Tick on the clock balls gonna drop I'm gonna stop
Get on the job I wanna rob I'm feelin hot hot
Makin it hot play with my heart give all I got
You wanna clock how long I got
by the end of the song your mouth and mine be locked
Word I'm not gonna sit in here try n drop how I'm on top
I'm not sweatin here I just want what I want
And let me make it clear how you got it- you got it
It's tricky tricky tricky stomach sicky
if you pick me kick me simply cuz I'm dreamin
C'mon pick me miss me how I'm screamin kiss me
nick me hot diggy sick it to me give it to me
Hand it to me bandit, bandit, be a man
Tuck me undercover lover hover on my planet lover
Mad habits mad for havoc gotta have it
Planned it like you never had it
Gallavant like elephants-- so so fat

I'll meet you halfway, I'll meet you halfway
I'll meet you halfway to the sky and the stars
Yo I'll meet you halfway but baby just smile at me
Keep it alright keep it alright keep it alright
I keep it alright

My walkie talkie's on high for you anytime
For you, but I'm still walkin-- flyin high for you
Frequent indecencies only one like me
Transmittin frequencies only you and me could see, space time infinity
I can see for miles and miles, your smile, I keep my mind beyond
Well I could die any minute
Come up in it a mile a minute
It's imminent and while I'm in it gotta hit it and I mean it
Can I feel it close close-freeze
How's it supposed, supposed to be
Now hot in the most most you'll ever need
Now from coast to coast I breathe
I breathe I breathe I breathe
I breathe I breathe I breathe -- 
I keep it on the alright baby
Keep it on the alright baby, keep it on the alright baby

I'll meet you halfway, I'll meet you halfway
I'll meet you halfway to the sky and the stars
Yo I'll meet you halfway but baby just smile at me
Keep it alright keep it alright keep it alright
I keep it alright</pre>
