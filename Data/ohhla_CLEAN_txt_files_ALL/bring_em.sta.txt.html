[Intro: Sample from "Throw Ya Gunz" by Onyz] (Joell Ortiz) (*Statik Selektah Sample) (**Statik Selektah)
Bring 'em up dead! (Statik! (*Statik Selektah!) (AND YOU SAY NEW YORK CITY!!!)
Your! Mine! It's all about crime! Your! Mine! It's all about crime! 
Bring-Bring 'em up dead! 
Your! Mine! It's all about crime! Your! Mine! It's all about crime! 

[Verse One: Joell Ortiz] (Sample from "Throw Ya Gunz" by Onyz)
(Bring-Bring 'em up dead!) We dump lead like a Brita
Mutate ninjas with shells, no Shredder no Splinter
Hit you in the leg if you turn sprinter
We corner store bread winners North Face in the dead of winter
Nose runnin block huggin snap a picture
I show you how to do this son turn an 8 ball into a pool table
That'll fill up your pockets in six months
Twist blunts, wishin I could go back just once
Man I miss the old New York I fuck around and get fronts
You kids frontin like you tough but you snitchin
You'll do anything to get out of them 'cuffs like magicians 
E'rybody I dap would give anybody a knap
Have the crowd screamin WEIGHT like e'rybody is fat
I joke about it 'cause I lived it then I wrote about it 
Float about it hopped on stage did some shows about 
But I'm not these rapper niggas dog I'm so about it
Little argument I probably hooked that's how I go about it (Word though)
I tell your bird whoa easy on the brains
Slurp slow girl I'm swervin I don't wanna hit the curve yo
That's the perks though I get a couple bands
Ice flood a couple bands e'rytime I let a verse go
I'm on a low carb cheatin 
All this bread got these wolves eyein ma but you'll be clingin to that bed
When I, make it there on time and doc'll

[Chorus: Sample from "Throw Ya Gunz" by Onyz] (Statik Selektah)
Bring 'em up dead! (AND YOU SAY NEW YORK CITY!!!)
Your! Mine! It's all about crime! Your! Mine! It's all about crime! 
Bring-Bring 'em up dead! 
Your! Mine! It's all about crime! Your! Mine! It's all about crime! 

[Verse Two: Joell Ortiz] (Sample from "Throw Ya Gunz" by Onyz)
(Bring-Bring 'em up dead!) I'm from the home of the homeland
Nobody want this chrome unless police try to regulate
But we own this fiends don't want loafers
Toes froze and slidin through the snow just to try and sell they sofas
Hocus pocus you disappear from all that smokin
That little white rock is more than potent
It's soul controllin, and we in soul control
The more dough you fold you scale that totem pole
The hoes groped your pole the shooters on payroll
You ready to rock and roll they ain't hopin out patrol cars no mo'
But it ain't sweet nah, you graduated now they feds wanns speak huh?!
What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?
Well keep it shut all my alley cats will scratch at your gums
Do the crime gotta eat that time soldier
Hang that up bab' boy sly time is over
I got roughed up by the roughest, fucked up motherfuckers
Escaped hopped in them gates and scuffed up all my chuckers
And I'm still runnin, but not from shit
I just been on that shit and run nigga I run shit
You old ass niggas hatin 'cause your son slipped
Whenever he hear that yaowa after the drum hit
Your slum bitch give you a cum kiss I keep a bad young bitch
That squirt when I fuck her feel like she cum piss
I tell shorty suck my soft dick and......

[Chorus: Sample from "Throw Ya Gunz" by Onyz] (Statik Selektah)
Bring 'em up dead! (AND YOU SAY NEW YORK CITY!!!)
Your! Mine! It's all about crime! Your! Mine! It's all about crime! 
Bring-Bring 'em up dead! 
Your! Mine! It's all about crime! Your! Mine! It's all about crime! 
Bring-Bring 'em up dead! 
Your! Mine! It's all about crime! Your! Mine! It's all about crime</pre>
