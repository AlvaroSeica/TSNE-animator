(*talking*)
Say, listen up mami
I need to lace you up, on what you really need
Pay attention

[Hook - 2x]
Say girl, you need a thug in your life
These busters, ain't loving you right
You need a thug, in your life
These busters ain't loving you right

[Lil' Head]
A real thug I be, you ain't gotta check my thug I.D.
You can tell by my appearance, and the way I speak
Now what you know, about this Texas boy
That'll go to the fight sit front row, and place a bet on Roy
Be in the clubs, at the back of the bar
Cause I'm the type of cat, that keep a forty glock in back of the car
Oh I did I mention, that my name was Head
You know the same object that you play with, when you lay in my bed
You a perfect ten, should I say a dime piece
Hiram-Clarke or Braeswood, is where you can find me
All gritty and grimey, from steady pacing the block
I'm a hustler, either you accept it or not
Even though, I live a dangerous life
I get what I want at any time, without naming the price
You got thug passion, like my nigga Pac said
I garuntee you great sex, in even a wide bed come on

You know, that I want you
I gotta have you, in this freaky type of way
You so fine, you're blowing my mind
Can we spend some time, can we so this let's do this
Come on come on and give it, give your loving all to me
I can fulfill your fantasies, keep it reeeeal
I know you want to, I can see it in your eyes
Come on come on come on, can we do this let's do this
May I just say, you really got it going on
And any man in his right mind, they would love to take you home
Is it him is it me, wine cooler or Hennessy yeah yeah
Come on mami vibe with me, vibe with me

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Head]
I need a down ass broad, that'll ride for me
If a nigga go broke, she'll give me a thee
If a nigga need work, she'll buy me my cheese
You know the type of down broad, that'll pass me her keys
Tell a nigga to be careful, when I'm flipping the whip
If it's out of town lick, she be taking a brick
Come in at any time, she don't bitch bout shit
Garunteed a big dealer, and my playa's fixes
I know fa sho, that my boo gotta ride with me
Like Bonnie and Clyde, we chasing nothing but that currency
And if you ain't down move around, let a playa do his thang
I need me a gangsta bitch, that's all about her change
