Ya probably ain't expecting this one
Nope, yea clap clap un hun
This something my grandmother would dance to or something
Sha ba doop doop dooooo
Sha ba doop doop dooooo

[Chorus]
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall...
(I know you wishing it would rain)
Nights like this I wish
That rain drop would fall...

[Verse 1]
Ay Grandma and Grandpa
Look at ya grandson, I done made it far
Damn nana, I know its killing ya bones that damn cancer
I wish I had an answer, but I don't I'm just wishin for an answer
Watchin my mamma cry, shes watchin her mamma die
Every second I'm drying my mamma eyes, she so proud of her son
See right through my mamma eyes, she just follow the drips
You can't dodge the rain but you can follow the drips
And every drop of rain that falls, has a drop a pain involved, you better believe
88 cocaine it solves, now the dope came in charge yup
I see my niggaz for what they really are, what we really are
The dicks we really are, let it rain

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It has been long fights like this
Long days, long nights nights like this
I'm wishing for rain. Nothing but the wind ever came
Little girls with they skirt up, the world's getting worser
Man I twirled through the world in a roaster
Twirling the smoke up, I be so high
Shit a week goes by, I still think the week just started
Man weed still sparking, still in tune with the street man
He still sparking, go ahead nigga leap feel frogish
These streets I harnish, my peeps my partners
Cam, jim, zeek my sponsors. black, griz, snags my monstrous
Paper, drugs, twin my archor. Robs, 40, doe, guard
Bus, train and go hard. let it rain

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This is a story, about a young boy wishin for glory
Rap, riches and glory. some people I'll love to share it with
Yea my people my thugs I'll share it with
You can't eat through this love I'm dealing with
You can't see through this love I'm dealing with
You can't be through or eat through this love I'm dealing with
Its real I'm feeling it my niggaz. cats plan on killing it
Rats real I'm realing it all men like fishermen
Say (hey hey hey baby)
Drive sticks while sticking 'em, young chicks I'm dicking 'em
All down and yea they all down
But why it got to be like this, why every girl I meet got to be like this
Let it rain

[Chorus]

Let it rain

I'm just siiting here
Wishing it would rain
I'm just sitting here waiting for the rain
Waiting for the rain</pre>
