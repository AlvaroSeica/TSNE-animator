[Chorus: 4X]
BITCH, I'ma blockstar, I'ma blockstar
I'ma Blockstar, Ima, I'ma Blockstar

[Streetz]
Yes I'ma blockstar better get right
Things on the scale got me lookin way right
Kids wanna be like me I tell em be better
Niggaz get mad, I tell em get cheddar
Ja ja jam in dat new whip open up da freeway
Bet it all on da dice nigga dats how we play
I'ma throw da deuce when i , when I ride pass
You gone play da bus stop wit yo broke ass
Style on you haters I'ma have em real sick
Shoes untied in other words I will trip
Vacation to you, to me a fieldtrip
Beatin down da block system louder den a bitch
Pa Prada for da kicks, vasace for the lenses
You lookin for da 5's we pullin all da ten'ses
Shorty who ya friends is bet it pop off
All the girls on me cause they want a blockstar

[Chorus]

[Young Deuces]
Yes, I'ma Blockstar cruisin through da city
Guerrilla in da trunk yea I know you niggaz hear me
That thang got a hemi and the wheels on chop
Shinnin for da public cause you know I got guap
See da money don't stop, Green light e'rry where
Toss a couple huneds, make it flood, I don't even care
Homie I'm da man you should see it like a prophet
If you own ya own shit you should see a lot of profits
Walkin like the president but cruisin like da pope
I'm talkin dope boy fresh you know I use a lot of soap
You niggaz talkin beasty nigga say it in my face
I hear you claimin that you ballin all I see is pump fakes
See da bank roll, fat knot, thick stacks, back block
Checks in the mail paper bags from the crack spot
Money aint a thang I get paid in many places
Doors open up like side kick faces

[Chorus]</pre>
