[Movie dialogue]
"The Serpent and the Rainbow"

[Merc Versus]
Headless morning star, the Romans Aphrodite was Venus
Leviathan and Behemoth stand on the horizon of Egypt
Like Osiris and Jesus we need a Messiah to lead us
And reveal the divine secrets of the Rise of the Phoenix
Angels massacred devils and the faith of the pastors
Prayers answered for the law sheep that grazing the pastures
Kill slithering snakes, liberate the slaves from the masters
Read the ancient chapters and travel on Jacob's Ladder
True craftsman, precision of an architect's judgement
Scars are punishment, perfection of the Ark of the Covenant
Venom strikes the nerve
Every word that my pencil writes against the Cenobite
Skinning a life span of a diplomat
Winds are cold and warm air, currents are swift &amp; changeable
In control of warfare, curse of the fifth angel
Elohim, Cherubim, Seraphim, Nephilim
Heaven's wing watch us subconscious of everything

(Hook) Kamachi 2x
Yeah, swift angels look at the wingspan
Listen here, crowns in the air when the kings jam
Ain't nuttin' change it's the same where you been fam
Still yellin' Zulu until we get banned

[Chief Kamachi]
The only light on my mind, they tryna break the lamps
World ain't nothing buncha human concentration camps
Millions of robots fronting off microchips
Arm guards on the building holding rifle clips
Now they monitor our movement with a psycho glitch
I know it's power we can find to help us fight the rich
So God bless America, you trifling bitch
Dopefiend Statue of Liberty need a nightly fix
Look at the torch on her hand, see it's slightly twitch
Uncle Sam the man help her fill the pipe of nix
Long as we sleep they getting high on our souls
Stuck us here like the puppeteer wiring our souls
Tryna find an exit plan, water in the desert sand
Think too much, they don't hesitate to just behead the man
They want everything, the house and the morals
You get a picture of some white Jesus painted in murals

(Hook) Kamachi 2x</pre>
