We balling, screens falling
We crawling, shot calling

[Lil' Head]
Everytime I hit the block, I convert my top
In J8 with Palamene, on Bravin's with dots
Bitches flock, just like they flies on shit
Lil' Head I been legit, and plus my screens stay lit
Now picture this, everywhere it seems that I go
Niggaz mad and kinda jealous, cause I'm taking they hoe
Face the fact that I'm a hustler, plus I got mo' do'
Than Cover recieved signing, for his first year pro
I know, these bitches out here loving the name
I'm quick to fuck they head up, like they tooting the caine
I'm choking and Gucci loc'ing, while I'm gripping the grain
What I'm puffing on fool, shit pounds of the Jane
From Austin Texas San Anton', I'ma floss my chrome
U-turn through Rosewood, back through Acres Home
Backdo' to Southwest, to bout Cobblestone
Fuck the laws I'm looking good, plus I'm in my zone I'm on chrome

[Lil' Head]
I said I'm balling baby, twenty twen-twen's begin to spin
When I'm crawling baby, tipping slow stopping traffic
Cause I'm stalling baby, my screens fall a lot
Invisible in my mouth, I got all the rocks
I'm looking hot, hotter than that Iceberg Slim
I got another glass set, I'm bout to crack the rim
I'ma swang on these 'Vards, and bang on these boys
Balling out of control, and maintain on these boys
See around here, we ride 4's or 3's
I hustle and selling drank, strack bottles of cheese
Head rest with TV's, keep the vision on clear
A-4's on stretched Seville, yeah that's slab of the year
I ain't riding dick, but that's hood affiliated
Even though I'm hated by many, my skills they can't fade it
Where I'm from, I'ma state it represent the Dirty Dirty
If it ain't Jag or slab, it's Benz 4-30 huh

[Lil' Head]
I say the Southside, that's the only set I claim
Screw tapes up in the deck, that's the only thing I bang
Lil' Head's about his change, cause I'm top of the line
Quick to bust a nigga ass, at the drop of a dime
See my niggaz, known for big balling and shit
Cause my niggaz, known for shot calling and shit
And my niggaz, known to spit game at your bitch
And quick to blow a couple thee's, like it ain't bout shit
See I plan to see my fantasy, balling on yachts
Throw a party for the hood, invite the whole block
Get served by top notch, hoes walking around
And the ones that's steady hating, they gon wanna know how
Did I get it, the fame the change and all that
I don't believe in driving fast, I creep and crawl Lac
My money in tall stacks, that's only way accepted
Anything less than fifty, the money is for neglected nigga
