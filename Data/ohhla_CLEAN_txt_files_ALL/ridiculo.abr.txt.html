What am I supposed to do?
I'm tryin to get close to you
but my posing is over
I'm toasted but I'm sober
And I might get ridiculous x2

[Verse 1]
Get with us when we walk right through the door
I'm cocky to the core
You're rocking new velor
It's shocking cuz I swore that I'm not suited for a suit that's in the store
But I got booted before from a club
They said I looked too comfortable
I didn't realize I'm supposed to be uncomfortable
I could pump you full of tales from my past
The disasters I've had acting brash but I'll pass
Now at last in the spot I got my last shot
I flash what I got and I ask for a spot in the VIP
I know that I'm not VIP
But my style cannot be copied
In my head I am the top seed
What I need is a bottle
Then I'll look  distinguished
Talking to some models who can't speak English
Sing this song, and ring the alarm
Where's the after party could you bring me along?
Yo

[Hook]
What am I supposed to do?
I'm tryin to get close to you
But my posing is over
I'm toasted but I'm sober
And I might get ridiculous

[Verse 2]
Now the spot is crazy hot
Almost time to smoke this haze I got
But this ain't Dazed and Confused
Misbehavin' is rude and I'm a nice gentleman
At least tonight, my plan is to settle any beef that's unnecessary
Keep it clean
We don't want 5.0 to have to peep the scene
But I might need caffeine cuz I didn't eat my greens
All I had for dinner was a frozen Lean Cuisine
It's insane how the flowing's still goin
We won't throw in the towel till morning
Don't know what time it is, it's so complex
You never wear your Rolex when you roll on ex
But I ain't got no diamonds, flossin or shinin
You won't see me crossing that line into the player zone
Cuz I'm a stay my own until my days are gone
What you waitin on?
Who you got on your team?
I support the youth like I'm protein
Yeah

[Hook]
What am I supposed to do?
I'm tryin to get close to you
But my posing is over
I'm toasted but I'm sober
And I might get ridiculous

[Verse 3]
So the next day you wake up, and the clock reads three
Reflection in the mirror makes a mockery
Your face is rocking a crease
You think to yourself, hey, yo, stop being weak
You spent most of the night smoking broccoli at least
Humble is born, cocky's deceased
Cuffed up nights lead to gritty days
The city way of life is getting blazed
Your life has become nothing more than a spoof
That's replacing your youth with the face of a dude who is hasty and rude
Now you're burnt out
Your girl's concerned about your sperm count
Drugs and beers by the dozen
Hear my discussion of fearing and fussin
We are accustomed to see our disgusting actions, and we call it fashion
Imagine, singin bout not being wasted
Take this song, copy and paste it

[Hook]
What am I supposed to do?
I'm tryin to get close to you
but my posing is over
I'm toasted but I'm sober
And I might get ridiculous
