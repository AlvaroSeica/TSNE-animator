Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Fuck what I've been
I'm doing it, no one do it better though
I never thought in my past I had to let it go
From my arrest rate up to my..
Let's say, my debts pay!
Now it's one stage, one mic
But the money is still green and the... white
Check me, mother fuckers how I take flight!
Never see enough money, can't make right!
No manager of the manager
My own man, call it my..
The damage is gone, this shit crazy
Soon they cut the cameras on
This shit amazing, we rappers get exterminated and gone
We get to lie, talking about the... that they buy
And the jets that they fly
He never had a dime like me
Cause inside is who you need to be
Cause the outside ain't you
A part of..
Cause this is who I..
Not just who I was
Who I am, who I'm gone, be just one..
Ten niggaz, one... but we are in
If we all fighting then we all get him on his feet
No rules!
No niggaz have no clues!
... act like I don't know you!
Baby momma bullshit is what you go through
But she ain't a porno star doing shit in the whole

[Chorus]
... killing me since
Way, came back
And have been killing me since!
Way, came back
And have been killing me since!
You niggaz ain't shit, I've been killing... since. [x2]

Yeah, with no tears drops either
Fuck ya all I ain't gotta make you a believer!
When your daughter got a fever and your doctor said she's stressed out
This is when you noticed somebody getting stressed out
You know the feeling in the... when you let out
Years go by, but there's some shit enough to get by
What you get through
You reach back and break the niggaz out of this... where they sent you
Maybe I'm just too true
But I refuse to do things that you do!
I'm a stay in my own lane and you too
Never let the niggaz know more than you know!
Rap this! See my life... you do!
Two... filed up and don't know who's who
How long mother fuckers, this is...?
Cash... record... used to. </pre>
