[Intro]
Ay Laflare Entertainment
DJ Ace right
And it's goin down tonight in the 6 baby
Check it out
We gon' do this shit for all my street niggaz
All my thug niggaz, all my trap niggaz, knahmtalkinbout?
All my niggaz who trap all day nigga trap all night
All my niggaz who stay in the street gettin it 24/7
As a matter of fact, you don't work, you don't eat
You don't try, you don't shine

[Gucci Mane]
I'm a street nigga dog, everybody know dat
So a hater get smashed, bond money on deck
Gave my dog half a brick for a '73 dump
Got that bullfrog paint, so I know it gon' jump
I'm a real street nigga, do you understand me?
I'm a walkin bank roll, Breezy rubber band me
Sprayin monkeys on my ass, Gucci frames on my face
Got the Tony Tiger kush mayne, pimpin smoke great
Every time my phone ring dog it's 18-5
Only problem that I have is what car I'm gon' drive
I'm a real street nigga, I ain't never had shit
See the chain round my neck cost four or five bricks
I'm a street nigga dog, I don't love no bitch
I ain't talkin to you baby less you buyin ten bricks
Bought a oh-six Lamb' with the butterfly doors
That's a quarter million dollars gone just to pull hoes

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm a street nigga dog, I'm a street nigga dog
You a street nigga just like me
I'm a street nigga dog, I'm a street nigga dog
No industry, I'm in these streets

[Gucci Mane]
I'm a street nigga, dog hoes love my swag
And the Jacob on my wrist, that's a drop top Jag
Bought a drop top 'Vette and a super bad bitch
How much you thank it worth? 'Bout ninety-five bricks
Way back in ninety-five it was ninety-five cents
Now I'm 95 South with an R&amp;B bitch
Every time I leave the house bring at least ten grips
Cause it's two or three stacks just to park my whips
Got a small amount of niggaz but a large amount of clips
And a blue Bent' Coupe same color as the Crips
Mean mug's on my face, nigga I ain't nuttin funny
Sixty grand on the Jake, nigga time cost money
Got a quarter mill' plate that's eighteen blocks
If the cops try to whip me man I ain't gonna stop
I'm a real street nigga dog I ain't gon' lie
Bought a bale of bubble kush just to get the clique high

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm a street nigga dog so I love my whip
Car jack a street nigga, that's how niggaz get killed
I'm a street nigga dog so I love my block
Paid a junkie three grams just to wash my drop
Street niggaz love me and I love street niggaz
Got a out of town trap, come twice a week nigga
I'm a East Atlanta vet man, I ain't done yet
Bitches standin in line just to wipe my sweat
If you make a good count, then you earned a good check
Never beef with street niggaz, dog that's your best bet
Street niggaz make a college bitch panties so wet
To a project bitch, I'm the best it's gon' get
Street nigga of the year dog, yeah that's me
Just to see my wrists twirl, man it's eighteen G's
Gucci eatin real good dog, what about you?
I'm a street nigga dog, you a street nigga too

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And there you have it nigga
Gucci Mane, La-motherfuckin-flare nigga
Strictly for the streets nigga
If you not a street nigga man you can't fuck with this shit nigga
Zaytoven what's happenin nigga? You a crazy nigga
Y'all niggaz know what it is man, 2006 man
Gucci Mane, La-motherfuckin-flare man</pre>
