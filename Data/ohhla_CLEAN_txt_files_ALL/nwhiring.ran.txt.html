[Intro: K-Murdock]
Okay, today's to-do list
I gotta hit up all 50 of these blogs
to try and promote the single I'm droppin tomorrow
I want to tour in two months
so I need to contact all 25 of these venues
And of course, at some point make a beat
AUGH!~!!!
I need a manager!!!!!!

[Chorus 2X: Open Mike Eagle]
Cause I don't wanna be a a-hole
Too many yes men I need someone to say no
I don't have much in terms of payroll
[1] I just wanna make music and lay low
[2] I don't know what else to say yo

[Random]
Consider this my announcement, now hiring
I need management - not street teaming, and flyering
I can tweet my own links so thank you kindly
Don't need nobody co-signing and followin blindly
Cause it's gettin more tedious and devious
Dealin with the websites and media
In need of a, manager that just won't do it for wealth
Just someone who can do more than I do for myself
Cause some days I spend more time promotin and solicitin
than I do listenin to beats and that's kinda sickenin
I need someone to filter through my e-mails
Pick out the important ones, summarize the details
Then when I see cats and they ask "Did you get it?"
I can be like "nah, my manager musta hid it"
Dog I like Netflix and X-Box
But I'm at my PC more than cats when a desk job (I need a manager)

[Chorus]

[Random]
Yeah; record labels they don't know how to market me
Need me to stay in one lane so they can target me
But they don't understand it's hard for me
I'm plugged into games and hip-hop like ventricles and arteries
I get requests to call people when they sick
How do I respond to that without bein a prick?
When someone asks me if I can pay to play
I wanna cuss 'em out, but instead I opt to stay away
Times like that, I wish I had management
cause I'm faced with the BS and just can't handle it
I'm not the type to give cats the runaround
like all these fake dudes claimin they rep the underground
I can spend my time doin what I wanna do
And that's makin dope records for y'all to party to
Or if I have a stalker fan and don't know how to handle her
I can always say (I don't know, call my manager)

[Chorus]

[Random]
One day, did a little experiment
when I was comin up and still gainin experience
I wrote my bio in the third person
Pretended that I wasn't me, but in fact, a third person
A manager, a rep, whatever worked
And when cats responded, they were never jerks
Even if they couldn't invite me
They spoke to management, they spoke politely
But if I say I represent myself
My music's dope, book me, I'm gonna need some help
It's like when jobs ask if you got experience
But no one hires without experience
So how am I supposed to gain experience?!
I just rhymed four bars with experience
See, this is how stressed out I am man
It's a-ffectin my rhyme skills man
I really, really, need management
I can't do this...

[Outro]
I need a manager!</pre>
