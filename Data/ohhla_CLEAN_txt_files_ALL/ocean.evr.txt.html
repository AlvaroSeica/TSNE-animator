[Everlast]
There's a house up on the hill
where you can just make out the ocean
There's a woman there waitin for your hard work
All and every breath she takes is like artwork
And I think that I can just about touch the ocean
There's 1500 miles, between me and my next real smile
I think that I can just about smell the ocean
I'm full of unquestionable devotion
But I think I put a terrible thing in motion
The ocean

[Everlast]
There's a house up on the hill
Where the air smells like the sea
I left my heart up there
Rusting in salty air
I tried to make it home but I lost the key
It's been six hundred days
Since I laid eyes on your gorgeous face
I'm trying to make it home but I lost the key
I'm waiting for the Lord to set me free
I'm wishing that you were standing here right next to me

[Outro]
There's a house up on the hill (the ocean)
where you can just make out the ocean
There's a house up on the hill
It used to feel like home (the ocean)
There's a house up on the hill
Where the air smells like the sea (the ocean)
And there's a house up on the hill</pre>
