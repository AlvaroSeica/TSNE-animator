[Flesh]
Flesh keepin it wicked
Kickin em up bitch
Flippin his tongue, hit em up
Now he's so deadly
Then if he want some come get hung

I'm gonna get wicked kickin' it, scriptures of my anthem
Run it quick like a phantom when I plant 'em
I done sent them to the grand champion, I be
But begun, number one, that's me, he's handsome
Bringin' it to you, top drop, what'd you figure?
Told my gun, take over the nation,
Kickin' that gangsta, thugsta nigga
He's a loose cannon on the trigger
Clack back, put 'em in a maze always
Stack that penny and pack that gat
No hesitation when I put 'em on they back
Wanna play, they lay, he gets ziplocked
Gonna rip that flesh, buckshot kill
Pass the bodybags to the niggas from off St. Clair
Leavin' us wig splitters
All of them feel us, let us rips. If you try us
Don't fuss, then nigga, now feel this
Nuttin' us with my steel
And real, all of my shit went real
Let's make 'em all bow down, put 'em on they knees
Don't sneeze, that's on my enemy, freeze
Fuck it, let all of the law in line
We'll enter the S.C.T. in me
Had a good day, Flesh here to set niggas straight
Anybody with problems, I gotta solve 'em
It's just me and a nine, he lay
And if you hatin' to elevate
must let off my frustrations from all the playa hation
But it's keepin' my strong, and yes I do
Jesus, ride right by my side through temptation

Chorus

[Flesh]
While i'm handin' out invatations
Get 'em up, don't hold your applause
Fuckin' with Fifth Dog
And I bump every last one of y'all
Off the wall with my bad ass
Nigga that'll split ya, come test my size
Ready for the end, you gon' realize my enterprise
Oh, somebody caught you by surprise
Leavin' 'em stunned and amazed
Rippin' 'em with my tongue
And each day give the bastard my gift and
Hey, say, pockets switch and
then they all come his way, huh
Play dirty when i'm on a mission
If you wanna fuck with this, come and get with it
I let off a buck and i'm leavin' you finished
No, innocent misses will not celebrate cause
Who wanted to kill you
Then go get your shit if you thought I was slippin'
I pop in the clip and I blast niggas who trip, then I flip
And I fuck 'em up fast, straight kickin' that ass
You feelin' the wrath
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, so many busted
Had nothin' to say to the po po
And I hope heaven knew really who was it
Man, that early bird had me swervin'
in my Suburban all over the curb
It really was hurtin', so I got weeded to calm my nerves
Yeah, herbs'll work, ya heard that I might be comin'
To visit your city to kick it in, chill
If any y'all fellas hate, your cap get peeled

Chorus

[Flesh]
Pump, pump, pump, pump, better let my shell down
Don't throw it, it's not my fire
The silencer ain't over while loadin' my pistol
Trues stop at my house, and then hop on out rollin'
They got me in a hold up
Gun bucked them down, buried six feet in the ground
The silencer gun made not one sound
Better run when I let this one round
Well, how do you like me now?
We the killas, still the realest
Mo Thug, my gang bang, bang, makin' you feel the pain
That's drivin' you niggas insane
Flesh always been down for my thang
Remember that shit won't change
Gotta make all my money, give us some money, hungry
When you ain't got it, shit, it ain't funny
Nigga, my niggas been down for the struggle
Now must you prepare for the war
Callin' all Mo Thug soldiers
Nigga done told you
We be the wasteland warrior
I know you know that I know that
You don't really wanna fuck with Flesh
Stay packin' that Smith &amp; Wesson
Bullet proof vest protect my chest
Any test, lay to rest
I'm hot as a dropped atomic bomb
Stay burnin' like fire
Givin' you what you earned, desire
Learnin' you higher
My enterprise, we riders rollin' on
Hollow point, it's on
Come watch a hangin'
Body be so much swangin' and slangin'
Doin' my thang, and...
