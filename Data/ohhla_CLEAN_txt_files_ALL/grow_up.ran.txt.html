Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Random]
Man I promised I wouldn't get heavy on this joint {*static*}
I can't help it man I gotta be me {*static*}

[Chorus 2X: Random - singing]
I just can't seem to grow up
I said I just can't seem to grow up
But you know what? (WHAT~!)
I don't think I want to

[Random]
Ah ah okay okay
I was a young'n maybe 7 or 8
When I was up late playin games 'fore I was straight
Babysitter on the couch tryin to get her freak on
I'm passin level after level thinkin I'ma be PWN
But little did I know they didn't have any endings
Every couple of levels I would go back to the beginning
Hard lesson to learn, but I recovered fine
Couldn't beat Pitfall and got tired of tryin
But when the NES came around I had to get down
If you ain't have it on the block then you was 'bound to get clowned
My game was Super Mario, I played it to death
First to get a hundred men kickin turtles on the steps
Learned that from GamePro, but it's a shame though
Nowadays video games ain't the same bro
Too complicated and they ain't worth the price
You know somethin they a lot like life, and that's why

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Random]
Aight now follow me there, yeah
Say I don't care (I don't care) I don't care (I don't care)
Say I don't care (I don't care) say I don't care (I don't care)
I know you are but what am I? (I know you are but what am I?)
I know you are but what am I? (I know you are but what am I?)
Break it down

[Chorus]

[Random]
Know what?
I played every game in front of me, my peoples wanted none of me
Ran's skills in video games, they couldn't front on me
Mom knew how to punish me, take away the cords
'Til I thought they'd use the AC adaptor from my keyboard
That's when I knew that there was somethin amazin
My boys would get in trouble, I was cool cause I stayed in
Latch key kid, Home Alone like Macaulay
And 20 years later hostin Halo parties, cause

[Chorus]

[Random]
This song's for anybody who's ever been teased for being, a nerd
Don't sweat it, it's gon' be aight man
Fads come and go but intelligence, it never went out of style
Keep readin them books yo {*static*}
But uhh, lose the suspenders and the pocket protector
