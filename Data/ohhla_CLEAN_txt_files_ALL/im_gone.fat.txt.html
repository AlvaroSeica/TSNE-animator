[Intro: Fat Joe] 
Yeah!
This is it y'all (Darkside), Darkside Volume One
Hope you enjoyed
We had to take you out classic status, you feel me?
We had to touch it (Darkside) - Yeah!
So I say

[Chorus] + (sample)
Peace God I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm on my way
Peace God I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm on my way
Peace God (peace y'all!) I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm on my way
Darkside, Darkside, Darkside
{*DJ Premier scratches over fourth line*} ("Listen to the situationmy son")

[Fat Joe]
Premo on the beat, yeah I know it sounds different
But his man's just passed, yeah his soul's just risen
Cold, cold, world is the word that was given
As he see me fifteen with the burner out of prison
Gangster - fuck that, I'm +GangStarr+
Tell Nas +hip-hop's dead+ now, my man's gone
As I rise to the top, knee-deep in thegame I survived every shot
Back to life like +Thriller+, back to reality
Flipped the light scoop, got everybody mad at me
Uhh, don't let nobody put the battery
'Cause those things'll go 'pop pop' through your anatomy
I'm hungry nigga, I'll eat your flesh
I'ma butcher, chainsaw through your spleen and chest
There's a darkside of Texas too, word to syndicate
No matter how intricate shit gets, the hit you get
Joe Crack, yeah man on fire
Conversatin with the devil, rockin diamond messiahs
Uhh, I seek the truth while the streets admire me
Killers across the world say it's me they inspire to be
Feds on my back from my ties to criminology
Can't look back now, tomorrow's never promised B
Where I'm from, for +president+ we voted Eric B
Joe been crack way before my philosophy
Banned from TV, BET won't play me
Still we do it B.I.G. it's all gravy
It's our reality, you call it crazy
But it's a darkside, it's what you made me
No more Mr. Nice Guy - pay me
What you niggaz owe before I come for your babies?
{*DJ Premier scratches*} "Listen to the situation my son"
So I say 

[Chorus] 

[Outro: Fat Joe] 
Yeah! Been in this game for a minute man - seen a lot of shit man
Shout out Forrest Projects man, Diggin' in the Crates Crew
Went to the Amateur Night at the Apollo, won four weeks in a row
That nigga Chris Lighty came and signed me, nigga I had like ten cars
Medallions down to my dick nigga, Davader suits on - haha!
Saved my life nigga, I took a motherfuckin pay cut to do this shit right hereman
All these rappin niggaz talkin about they dope boys, they real niggaz man
I don't know - I don't see these niggaz, feel me?
So I wanted a lil bit more than that underground shit
Had that army fatigue, the Chuckers
I signed a nigga by the name of Big Pun
That nigga went double plat on niggaz
We was at the Grammy's with motherfuckin fo' fifths in our waist nigga
Hahahaha!
So you know Pun passed, I had to carry on tradition nigga
Don Cartagena had to rise to the occasion
All by myself nigga!
Linked up with the R, linked up with Ashanti - the rest was history nigga
Platinum plaques man
We been rollin ever since man, we been bank rollin ever since man
You feel me? That Lean Back was number one song of the fuckin decade
Check the fuckin Billboard nigga!
Shit! Niggaz wanna sleep on Crack
 Niggaz wanna front onCrack, I said, "Fuck y'all niggaz, I'm goin independent man!"

Make it Rain, threemillion iTunes sold man
I don't give a fuck nigga!
Fight for my life, this is the resurrection nigga!
Hop out the motherfuckin casket - brush the motherfuckin dust off my shouldersnigga!
Yeah - see what you don't understand is that I eat, sleep, drink music man
Nobody knows music like me man - this is what I do man!
All these miserable fucks man Â– e'rybody got they fuckin hand out
E'rybody want you to just come, give 'em money
Go across the world nigga, go earn, come back and give 'em money for free man
Tell them niggaz get a life, get a job, suck a dick nigga
It's Crack bitch!
Welcome to the Darkside - a.k.a. "I Don't Give a Fuck Music" nigga
A.k.a. "I Will Kill You Niggaz Music" - haha!
