Song:   Steal My Breath Away
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Maybe I'm just a little selfish
But I guess I just can't help it
Yeah I admit the fact I like it
Don't always wanna be the boss
Baby you can take me off my high horse
Take me by the hand and I might follow
You could be the one to take me I know
'Cause you won't give me what I want
I'm calling, no answer
You call back, I act like I forgot about you

Woah oh oh oh
You're not even mine
But my heart is like a glass house that you're just throwing stones through
Woah oh oh oh
I can't walk away
And watch your heart break
But I'm standing here really intrigued by you

Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
(Steal my breath away)
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
(Steal my breath away)
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
(Steal my breath away)
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away

I think you know exactly what you're up to
I can never change you if I tried to
Maybe that's the reason why I like you
Complicated's just my type
Don't let me set you off for failure
I know you don't believe a word I tell you
I told you that I'm troubled but you know better
Don't blame me when it's that time
'Cause we're bagging heads before we even get anywhere at all

Woah oh oh oh
You're not even mine
But my heart is like a glass house that you're just throwing stones through
Woah oh oh oh
I can't walk away
And watch your heart break
But I'm standing here really intrigued by you

Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
(Steal my breath away)
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
(Steal my breath away)

Boy you got me fantasising
See our bodies intertwining
When you put your lips on me

And our thoughts are so exciting
I don't even wanna fight it
Wanna give you all of me
Boy you better better better do me right
'Cause I never let anyone inside

Woah oh oh oh
You're not even mine
But my heart is like a glass house that you're just throwing stones through
Woah oh oh oh
I can't walk away
And watch your heart break
But I'm standing here really intrigued by you

Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
(Steal my breath away)
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
(Steal my breath away)
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away
(Steal my breath away)
Steal my breath away, breath away, breath away, breath away

You steal my breath away (steal my breath away)
You steal my breath away (steal my breath away)
You steal my breath away
You steal my breath away</pre>
