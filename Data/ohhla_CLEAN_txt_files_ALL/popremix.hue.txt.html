[Intro]
Aye, it's so boo-tiful when a plan comes together (yep)
It's yo' boy Memp Hitz
Y'all already know what this is
H-U-E-Y (REEEEEEMIX!!!)
Bow Weezy, T-Pain
HiTz Committee - pa'tnuh!

[Huey]
It's H-U-E-Y, home fly G5
and by the look in my eyes, she have nice thighs
What her mama done gave her then grew from local to major
My pockets flooded with paper, born as a Missouri stater
Mami gon take it low if you CAN then touch your toes
You AND yo partna them, you CAN get dollas den
Trick-IN ain't in my blood, BUT I'ma make it rain n'em
Too rich for dolla bills, I consider that as change
25's on my range, know that that's a odd number
The way you tootin that thang, can make the guys wonder (dayum!)
What's underneath, or even if it's real
I'm hopin she's a freak,'cause I ain't tryna chill (naw)
I'm tryna get it poppin, wit a +Shortie like Mine+
That's willin to drop it, low enough to blow my mind
It's H-U-ezy, and Bow Weezy
Let's see if she can get lower than befo' on the remix (REMIIIX!!)

[Chorus: Huey]
Toot that thang up, mami make it roll
Once you pop, pop lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you, baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock, drop it for me maybe we can roll, OH!

[women in background - 2X]
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it
Pop, lock, and drop it

[Bow Wow]
Damn lil mama I'm sayin...hm..
All dat in dem jeans?! Woo!
Ay, ay, let me holla at chu for a minute doe..

Hey what it is, they call me Bow Wizzle
Now pop, lock, drop it for me, make that thang jiggle
Yep, she moves her hips, just like Shakira (dayum!)
If she was in a contest, she would be the winner (yep!)
From Ohio all the way to St. Louis (uh huh)
Hey all the girls do it, just put your back into it
Now shake what she gave ya, I'm talkin bout ya mama
If you won't do it for ME then do it for these dollas (hahaha)
Cause I'ma make it rain, these otha dudes is lame
They talk a good game, but they cain't do the same (nah)
Now drop it up and DOWN, now take it to the GROUND
If you wanna please me, baby all you gotta do is
(Pop, lock, and drop it) But baby don't stop it
We can do it like Chris Brown girl and get it "Poppin"
Man I'm a pro, (yep) look, I'm far from a rookie (that's right)
Girl get your pretty self over here gimme them coukies

[Chorus]

[T-Pain]
...
(Shawty snap) yeah!
(Gawd-DAYUM! Shawty snap) Shaw-taaay!

Yea - now let me ask you a lil question that you never heard:
How do you make them dollas disappear like Copperfield for lack of better words?
Let me introduce my friend, that's Huey and Bow Wow
I'm the Pain, better known as Teddy Pend-Her-Ass-Down!
I'm G (yea) butchu pro'ly already knew that
Butchu didn't know that I could make you pop, lock, drop and do THAT!
Now under-STAND I'm the baddest man ALIVE
So let's just, bend your knees and do the G5 - NOW we fly!
YEA, now you can do it (yea!) YEA, I know you see me (yea!)
YEA, you wanna be me (yea!) YEA, you got my CD (yea!)
YEA, that's HiTz Committee (yea!) YEA, that's Baby Huey (yea!)
YEA, that's Bow Weezy (yea!) YEA, that's Teddy Pain
I'ma make you climb the pole
I'ma play you dependin on how this money unfold
and I got it from my mama I ain't tryna go, pro
If you pop, lock, DROP it I might let all of this go
Oooooooooh!

[Â½ Chorus /w T-Pain ad-libbing and singing "paw-op"]

[Outro]
Eh-hey, I guess that's what it is den, world
