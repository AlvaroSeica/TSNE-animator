[Lyrics Born as Steven]
Aww man it's been bad man, I've just
It's been so tough on me and everybody involved
And it's the type of thing that just
it brings everybody down! You know?
And, I tried so hard to change
But just one slip up you know
I know that my habit's out there right now
doin pushups, and situps, and squats
just ready to kick my ass as soon as I fuck up man
Y'know, and it hurts!
Y'know I went through my money
I went through my mother's money
I went through my girlfriend's money
I went through my girlfriend's ex-girlfriend's money
