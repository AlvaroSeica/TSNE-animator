[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, yeah right? Alright, uh
You can love me, love me, love me, love me, love me...

[Chorus 2X: Solomon Childs]
You can love me, or you can hate me
You ain't even gotta believe me
But when the gun powder turn warm, lord
Have mercy on me....

[Solomon Childs]
Police say I should of died already, guillotine
I declare war on this county, light up the bally
I want blood like Napoleon battles, the cooking spice'll
Have the crack house rattle, Killa Mob, the cattle
Northern rebel with that southern metal
Nigga, you playing with the wrong nigga, huh
Word, get killed over her? Word
Red rum, New York, nigga push blizzard crumbs
Push heroin jums, all authentic like a black panther shotgun
And I'm thinking, of a master plan
And ain't nothing but grams inside my hand
Kingpin, I love a broad with a round ass
Boulevard militia, let the gat flash
Get a combination up to the safe or I'm putting two in yo mama ass
Let the magnums dance, fuck, let the magnums dance

[Chorus 2X]

[Solomon Childs]
Porsche, like knives in your gat, you so gully, what's up?
Killa Mob nigga, get ya mob, nigga
This the year dead souls rise from Vietnam
You bitch, you need a dress, so we can send yo ass to the prom
Somewhere there's a dead man walking, you hear the siren horns
New York to Cali, my territory, a graph of blood out ya dick
In a fight, true story, all she did was swallow them kids
Ain't not need for Maury, this dedicated to police clappers
Boulevard, beef toast cookers, tongue kissing hood hookers
Nines, in your mouth, country, French kiss it, country
Or get clapped for them diamonds, country
Buried with them diamonds, country, Childs
Red Heroin nigga, Florida Brooksville blood, nigga
Who gon' stop the flood, nigga?

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Haha, I'm bout to twist you bitch ass niggas up
That's what I'm talking about, what's there to talk about?
I'm about to swiss ya bitch ass niggas up, you already know</pre>
