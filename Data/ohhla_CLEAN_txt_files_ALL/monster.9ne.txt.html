(Tech n9ne Talking)
Yo Turn this shit up a little bit Juan	
So these motherfuckers can feel what I'm saying
Yea, like that

(Monstah!) (Repeat 6 times)

[Tech N9ne]
When I was 5 years old
I relized there was a road
At the end, will I get
Pots of gold
Kidergarden teacher knew I was impossible
Gots to grow dick quick
To cock the hoe
Evil breed
We smoke weed without seeds
Do dirty deeds
Beat foul fiends
What the need
Walk around with a switch blade
In 6th grade
You'll get a blade
If you display you a bitch
Or Mitch Bade
Have you ever
Sold a preacher
Crack on sunday
Fucked your teacher?
7th grader
Under bleachers
Loosing data
Smokin reefer
Hostla migo, hostla laygo
Santa Fe hoes
After I pop, I stop and lay low
Damn clown from kan town
Many man found
Theres a monster breeding
Nigga stand down!

(Monstah x3)

[Chorus]
If you wanna act like me
(Monstah)
You gotta pop a gat like me
(Monstah)
Makin niggaz skat like me
(Monstah)
Dumpin hella crack like me
(Monstah)
You can always act like me
(Monstah)
But you gotta be black like me
(Monstah)
Keep huddled to your gat tightly
(Monstah)
Cuzz he just might be
(Monstah!)

(Tech n9ne) Verse 2:
It must be in my blood
It must be in my soul
Im musty in the mud
Im dusty in my clothes
Dont trust me ima scrub
Dont fuck with me I'm cold
Im quick to hold a grude
Dont touch me, I might explode
Im made for wrong
I spent too many days alone
Blaze the bong
Too many survalance homes
And niggaz shittya
Hit me ya
Bitch I'm aa into ya
Ass, just pass
But leave the clamitiea

[Don Juan]
What kinda nigga take X
But never heard of safe sex
What kinda nigga never think of learnin
Make his momma suck dick while he burnin

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Who dat nigga drinkin liquar
While Slim Shady bumpin
Who shot dem niggaz down
On land and 80 somethin, (TECH N9NE!)
Them drug dealers, who think they know where evil
lurks now
Whos that commiting sexual acts on church ground?

(Chorus 2x)

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Momma never knew wassup
She never knew id turn beast
When I grew up
She never thought that id go nuts
I hang with niggaz from the hood
Who still dont give a fuck
Im a creature from the black platoon
Pass the shroom
Blast to the moon
WIth half the room
Still everyone knows
I been a bad boy
Fuckin little orian, forrest hill cemetary
The defintion of a bad boy
Use to hit niggaz for runnin into us
Never had joy,And I Never ever really had toys
So I started playing with AK's
Making hella noise
Who killed fetuses
Who needed this GHB to get heated
Immediate
We get weeded then some concieded shit
Many more coming
Because, Because, Because
Its dark off in Kansas City
The Land of Oz

[Chorus 2x]

[Tech N9ne Talking]
Thats real
Thats just a piece
This is just a little piece of the story
Got much much more to tell y'all!

[Chorus]</pre>
