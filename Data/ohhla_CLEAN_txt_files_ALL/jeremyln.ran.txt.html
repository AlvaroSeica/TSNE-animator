[Chorus]
From undrafted to talk of the league
From afterthought to all over TV
I tell you hard work is the key, but uhhh
This is what can happen when you dream - I'm Jeremy Lin

[repeat Chorus]

[Random]
6 foot 3, with a 4.2
grade point average, not vertical
Overlooked by every single team
But never once did he let it hamper his dream
First in the gym and the last one done
Proving hard work pays off in the long run
Killed 'em in the previous summer
Dropped a career high when coach finally called his number

[Chorus]

[Random]
Cut off the roster from Golden State
Knew his time was coming, so he chose to wait
Never know when you gonna get up in the game
But he made his moment count in the biggest of ways
New York City the world's greatest stage
20,000 rabid fans scream his name
Wasnt recruited for his ball skills
And now you gotta wonder how they all feel
Didn't quit, he only worked harder
Went from Harvard graduate to NBA starter
The haters gon' hate and call him lucky
First Ivy Leaguer in the league since Chris Dudley
Must be some kinda desire
To make everybody who doubted you out to be a liar
And even if it only lasts a moment
Jeremy Lin took it and owned it - you gotta respect it~!

[Chorus]</pre>
