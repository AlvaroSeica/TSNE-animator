[Chorus: Lil Rob]
It's in my
It's in my blood to be an Aztec warrior
And never back or walk away
It's in my
It's in my blood to be an Aztec warrior
Hey homie, don't let 'em get away
It's in my
It's in my blood to be an Aztec warrior
Only they wanna play, they pay
It's in my
It's in my blood to be an Aztec warrior
Hey homie, that's all I gotta say
It's in my

[Verse 1: Lil Rob]
Blood
To take it to outer limits
Or until it's finished business
More than death wishes
We give them death kisses
Not the kind I give to the misses
But the kind I get
When it's time to get vicious
Don't stop until I drop
But I don't plan to drop
So I don't plan to stop
To make the whole planet rock
Through gun shots and what not
You shoot at me
I'm shootin' back
Why the fuck not
It gets hot
Don't forget your gun block
Cause you get
Way worse than sun spots, you get bullet holes
Left in critical condition
If not, locked in a box
With an eternal conviction, listen

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil Rob]
It's in my blood to hit switches in the Chevy Impala
At the same time, poppin' off balas, like it's nada
De bolada
If these vatos want pedo
Then we got it for a moment, fill 'em with lead like a pencil
Keep 'em in line like a stencil
If not pushin' up daisies
Twist it up like a pretzel
Do the shit on a daily
Take my .380 and aim it, take the trigger and squeeze it
You best believe it
I'll give it if they need it, then repeated
As needed
Til all these vatos are bleedin'
I'm hungry
Don't bother a fuckin' dawg when he's eatin'
If you like breathin'
Hey holmes, don't give me a reason
To open season on you, ese
Take this to your mente

[Chorus]

[Hook: Lil Rob]
I'm hot tempered, you can see the steam from my blood
When I bleed
I'm hot tempered, you can see the steam from my blood
When I bleed
I'm hot tempered, you can see the steam from my blood
When I bleed
I'm hot tempered, you can see the steam from my blood
When I bleed
I'M HOT TEMPERED, YOU CAN SEE THE STEAM FROM MY BLOOD
WHEN I BLEED
I'M HOT TEMPERED, YOU CAN SEE THE STEAM FROM MY BLOOD
WHEN I BLEED
I'M HOT TEMPERED, YOU CAN SEE THE STEAM FROM MY BLOOD
WHEN I BLEED
I'M HOT TEMPERED, YOU CAN SEE THE STEAM FROM MY BLOOD (FROM MY BLOOD...)

[Chorus]
