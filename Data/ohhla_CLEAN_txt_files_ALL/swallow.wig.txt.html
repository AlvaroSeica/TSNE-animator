[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, you got your eighteen karat grin, class chin
I break jaws, Versace robes and Theodores
Make me, king of the jungle, jurassic slangopoly
No Wu-Tang wallabee, this is Wiganometry
Back for that one-on-one street monopoly
Candy apple T-Bone ruby, the piece alone
Cost half a mil, you try to touch, you get two pieced
Your girl got protein thoughts, and swallowed them kids
Now she wanna tell me how special it is

"Hey, why don't you come? That means something"
"Wallaby, shut the fuck up"

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, it's Tone Tana, caterpillar belt with a big hammer
Nextel with a police scanner, Supreme grammar
I'm glorified, watch how the God do work
See ya'll pussy, I seen Russell Jones do Dirt
Wave the Iron Flag, I'm back like Return of the King
With a camouflage mink coat and a dookie ring
I pledge allegiance, my alliance to the Clan is firm
But this is Theodore, a new lesson in life to learn
Keep ya concern to new lingos, fuck fly flamingos
Push the head, to your back of your head, press out ya wrinkles
And pop stones, dangerous slang, no way I drop poems
Light bones, dusted out, fucking up your chromosomes</pre>
