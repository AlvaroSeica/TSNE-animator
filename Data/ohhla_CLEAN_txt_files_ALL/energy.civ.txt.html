[Intro: Beretta 9]
B9, Cilvaringz
Yo yo yo aiyo

[Beretta 9]
Murder one I wrote this
Y'all hold ya breath it's the kid from Red Dawn
Y'all niggas know the song
And if not, imagine, Beretta rap toe tag
Body bag return MC's from whence they came
Kid you know my name, my calibur, my aim
More range, Danny Ainge, cowboys and Indians
Tomahawk, chop off ya arms, get the kid again
out when we come thru, we out for ya whole crew
Producers are too, nigga, you, you and you
What the fuck you gonna do?
Beat ya feet to the rhyme, I wrote
If you knick knack, you better not smoke
that shit no more, nigga, no more

[4th Disciple]
As we drop these lessons, professin'
Yo who got questions? We strive to eliminate the guessin'
Godly profession, that be the blessin' in my smoke session
Yo! As we broke thru the smoke screen, arrive on the scene
Hands turned towards the team, offspring of Allah 13
As pure thought is transformed thru soundwave machines
By Digital means, we activate the extreme
Cuz we born with the blessin' in our genes
Sometimes it seems, that the thought, took years to build
We rotate wheels of steel, though trained in skills
Body still sore from the military drills, Energy revealed

[Cilvaringz]
Enter my Chambers at the perils of the Bastard Swordsmen
In this fuckin' life you can't depend on Lady Fortune
And so I energize everything as Yin and Yang
Knowledge the wisdom just to understand the savage man
See the Sword of Energy, I swing it at society
Cilvalize the ones who feared death and died mentally
Judge wisely, with dominant intelligence
The fuckin' world doesn't know what it fights against
All they want is silence and a life to adore
But there is No Love Without Hate, no peace without war
There is no white without black, no neck without sword
There's no cops without thugs, no LP without 4th
Disciple!

[Outro: Cilvaringz]
See the crazy thing about it is..
you got cops out there tryin' to fuckin' fight crime
It's that fuckin' crime that feeds their family
Yanawmean?
Without that crime there wouldn't be no food on the table for the cops
It's the crazy thing about it, son
Think about it</pre>
