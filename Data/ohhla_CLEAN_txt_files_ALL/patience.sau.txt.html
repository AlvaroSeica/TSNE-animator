[Saul Williams - singing]
Patience, over, anxiety; it's hard to remember the
love that, sprang from, simplicity; it's harder to maintain
It's getting harder to maintain {*8X*}

Love has, conqured over; it's hard to remember the
fear that, conqured, over; it's harder to maintain
It's getting harder to maintain {*4X*}

The blood boils over, and courses through you
When love takes over, there's nothing to do

Patience, over, anxiety; it's hard to remember the
love that, sprang from, simplicity; it's harder to maintain
It's getting harder to maintain {*8X*}</pre>
