The Mission.....

[Hypno]
My style cap to the Bible rap to the title track
I got it locked and aim like a rifle master
After the nine double, I need therapy cause my mind struggles
I search, but all I can find is trouble
With my big eye open, when I roll with a flow
It's just like, magnifico
Though my creations are felt and got occupational wealth
Still wicked as Satan's health
It's ok for your health, take a journey today
You'll learn the rules if ya please let me play with your mind
I make ya feel divine when I unravel a rhyme
That's gonna make you travel through time
You wanna get high? I'll take you to the bottom of the sky
Pass the galax-i, Hypno's gonna teach you to fly
Close your eye, then close your other eye
Now in a flash you on another ride to the other side

[Chorus:] (Ming Xia - sung) X 2
Travelin', searchin' for Wisdom....The Mission

[Ming Xia] (sung)
I want Wisdom, but Wisdom's only friend is time
Who I, I run away from
But he always catches me and walks faster than I ran
Time always gets his way
An uninvited guest who spends more than just one day
Told me the only way, that I can meet Wise
Is if he brought his friend Mistake

[Chorus] X 2 

[???]
Y'all know I'm movin' like a current, through the socket I shock 'em
Put me on the stereo, here we go spritiual I sock 'em
&gt;From the top to the bottom, ya know what? I got 'em
I load the mic up with heat, lock it cock it and rock 'em
Cause here I come, travelin', searchin' for Wisdom
Hittin' another plane that's in between the drum
So journey with me, I think you'll find when your done
Spooks raisin' up the caliber, out shinin' the sun

[???]
My control raps speak the truth like phone taps
I know you wanna express yourself, blow that
Cause my dispersement of searches remain stable and pertinent
When I'm hurtin' it the verbal philosophy resembles Socrates
Now who the FUCK wanna rock with me?
My approach is thunderous like giants with knockin' knees
And then I'm on a mission for bad karma that blister my balls
GA GA! Got 'em from behind his pigeon door

[Ming Xia] (sung)
Time always gets his way
An uninvited guest who spends more than just one day
Told me the only way that I can meet Wise
Is if he brought his friend Mistake

[Chorus til fade]
