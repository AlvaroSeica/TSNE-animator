[Verse 1 - Pegz]
If I had a life coach, a stylist, a spiritual guider
A criminal minded business advisor
A PHD in political science
Would I understand the government's indigenous crisis?
Don't trust what the government say
Nothing's changed since Sadam Hussein
For a kid growing up in Kuwait
Regulated by assumptions we make
Bombing trains with the blood in his veins
No languages of the past, mathematical sums
Passages of the Bible, chapters of the Koran
No, Bachelor of the arts
I read the signs, without astrological charts
No, psychologist to delve in my head
No relationship counsellor to help with the stress
No physiotherapist reality check
I got enough common sense and self-respect

[Hook]
Pegz: I'm still burnin
 	 I'm still learnin in life
 	 I'm still trynna say somethin
Reagan: Baby I don't need your judgment
Pegz: Still searchin my mind
	 But still trynna say somethin
Reagan: Baby I don't need your judgment
Pegz: Still learnin, still burnin inside
	 I'm still trynna say somethin
Reagan: Baby I don't need your judgment
	   Baby I don't need it

[Reagan]
Baby I don't need it

[Verse 2 - Pegz]
If I had a personal trainer, a chauffer, a chaperone
Black belt manager with focus and self-control
Holistic life, no smoking or alcohol
Would I live to see you wack ass rappers blow?
Would I appeal to American offspring?
Signed by Def Jam, managed by Don King
Back up dancers and choreographed boxing
Makeup artists and various brand sponsoring
That's bullshit, drop the fa¬çade
You wanna rap with an accent? That's not who we are
Poppa large big shot, number 1 on the charts
From the southeast coast where the poppies are cut (Ay)
No A&amp;R producing my best work
No Primo beat, no Kanye guest verse
No Timbaland remix, radio censored (Hey)
We hold it down for Australian brethren

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Pegz]
I didn't, play guitar in my adolescence
Have a, set of drums or piano lessons
Or a, milk crate full of Sabbath records
But I still got thrash metal fans dependent
No, green thumb, in hydroponics
No motivational speech by Tony Robbins
No, law degree, no brokering knowledge
To rise to the top and own a McDonald's
I don't, rest on my laurels or reputation
Every burning step is a revelation
Still dedicated, still getting wasted
Don't spend my days mourning expectation
