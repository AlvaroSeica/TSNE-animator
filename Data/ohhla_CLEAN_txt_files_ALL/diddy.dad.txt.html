Yeah.. it's Bad Boy baby
(Yeah, c'mon) Neptunes (mm, mm, mm, mm, c'mon)
And we won't stop (I like this right here)
Cause we can't stop (yeah)
Yeah, let me tell you somethin
Yeah, check this out

[Verse One]
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nick
Chillin with this chick named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
But she wasn't fond of players, only wanted ballers to spoil her
with six figures and camcorders
So what you tryin to tell me dear?
I got Bently, Benson and Mr. Belverdere
And I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin literally blow your mind
My repetoire is menage-a-trois and exotic cars
Chillin with the hottest stars
And it ain't no stoppin this
I can't help it I'm a optomist
And I'ma make ya head bop to this
And at the end you gon' rock to this
Now say my name, c'mon

[Chorus: Neptunes]
D the I the D the D the Y, the D the I the D
It's Diddy (Hold up!) It's Diddy (That shit's crazy!)
The D the I the D the D the Y, the D the I the D
It's Diddy (Hold up!) It's Diddy (Say whaaat?!)

[Verse Two]
Aiyyo, I came in the door, I said it before
I never the ladies hypnotize me no more
But.. but back to the manuscript
Cause I don't think you can handle this
From New York to Los Angeles
I think the whole world scandalous
I'm just tryin to keep the candles lit
Let the party people dance to this
Get out your seats and clap your hands to this
Because I came too far for me to be bourgeoise
It's a Bentley to you, to me it's a blue car
So Branson pass me a jar
Cause these cats done went too far
Yeah one phone call send two cars
And I still get searched by security guards (that's right)
I guess that's what I have to do
Take the game international, now what you call me?

[Chorus]

(La La La La La La La La La La La La)
C'mon work it out girl
I'm tryin to see you work it out girl
(La La La La La La La La La La La La)
C'mon work it out girl
I wanna see you work it out girl

[Verse Three]
Now hold up, stop (stop) now wait a minute
We don't stop we rock cause ain't a limit
My aim is winnin, got Asian women that'll change my linen
after I done blazed and hit 'em, but
I just wanna rock wit you (that's right)
And take it straight to the top with you
And do what I gots to do, if it's possible
Cause I ain't trying to stop you boo
I, got an agenda, got on a Ninja
One wheelin and killin it not to offend ya
That's when I met this chick named Brenda
Tender, her whole body bend like fender
So let me see you shake it girl (c'mon)
I just wanna see you shake it girl (c'mon)
For the return of the Don, the world in my palm
My moms calls me Sean but y'all call me

[Chorus]

(La La La La La La La La La La La)
C'mon work it out girl
I'm tryin to see you work it out girl
(La La La La La La La La La La La)
C'mon work it out girl
I wanna see you work it out girl</pre>
