[Nicki Minaj]
This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winnin now, this to dedication
This is meditation, higher education
This the official competitor elimination
I-I-I-I was takin trips with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half, like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up crack up in the stash
50 Cent, Italian, icy flow
This that Run-and-Get-a-Dollar-for-The-Ice-Cream-Cone
Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
but my memories only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggaz doin bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Voila, Sharika
Candace, Temby, Lauren, Iesha

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration for the ghetto
It's time, time to gooo, ohhhh
They know who we are, yhey know who we are
Champion, the champions, champion, champion

[Drake]
Yeah; okay we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erica
Labor transferred twenty million to Comerica
It's fuckin terrible, it's got me actin out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either ridin Range
or hFerrari top down screamin "Money ain't a thang!"
Tell me when I changed girl, but only when I change
Cause I live this shit for real, niggaz know me in the game
They know! Makin hits in three acre cribs
Cookin up tryin to eat, nigga steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Havin good times, makin good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make it do the splits for a rap
Wish you niggaz good luck, tryin to get where I'm at
Straight like that

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
Straight ballin in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo
Tell me one thing you won't do - settle
Give me one word for ya chain - yellow
Pocket full of money, black cards - ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, ain't I?
Jizzle how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay puttin on for the town - mayor
What you call a crib in the sky? Player
Half a mill' in three weeks, yeah I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yes she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, e'rybody pause for the photos
Somebody tell these local hatin niggaz I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne goin
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowin?
Don't let me hear Shawn Carter, I'm the ballest of the ace
Let me hear them Sean Combs, money gates that's in my place
Let's celebrate

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Whattup Nicki~?! It's Nasty, yeah yeah - yeah!
I saw my first two million dollars I was twenty-three
I'm barely a man, yet I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
Cause that's where a nigga from, murder on replay
My twenty-fourth B-day, I'm sailin to Bimini
You can see me on a yacht, blastin 'Pac, little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thuggin bitches, back to makin 'em kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire and desire to be different
My ten year old plan just one year 'til finish
My list went like this, first thing discover
the difference in pussy, white, black, latin or other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waitin lists just to hear me and witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter
Fast cash life, happily ever after, champions

[Chorus]</pre>
