[Frank Ocean]
Ahhh baby, yeah
Reminiscing on a younger love
Blowing kisses to me through the window of the bus
Daddy told you that I was dangerous
But I couldn't stop hustlin even if he asked me
Fast forward now we're grown-ups
But how could I forget that lovin you was such a rush
Our future could've been different
But lets just say I wouldn't stop hustlin even when you asked me
But you knew me well
You knew I had the love on a different scale
Heavy as the heavens, you could tell
I'm different now
But I still carry her with me still
It takes a strong young man
to survive out here
Carrying the pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
Used to have a backpack full of that work
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt
And the broken pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
It's gettin heavier!</pre>
