[The Jet Age of Tomorrow]
As time, passes by
Leavin y'all, who cares?
Dude, got me high
and this, is clear
We're, intertwined
and more, what's to fear?
In which we sleep, that's one thing I'll never need
Your love just falls over me, and I don't want you to leave!
You're always in my dreams, in hues and fuscias and greens
You chase so much that it seems, that you don't love me any more
Well what the fuck am I breathin for?
