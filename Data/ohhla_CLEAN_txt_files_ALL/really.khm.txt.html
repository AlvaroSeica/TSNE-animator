[Kool Keith]
Sizin' your crew to a T
Removin' your section with A-Team clout
Scopin' your girls Calvin Klein jeans like Mr. T
Bronx to Brooklyn, Bayshore to Staten Island
We hit Van Courtland
Cross Montreal, Vancouver, back into Portland
Take your hand off the radio and turn your man off
I know guys like y'all who talk a lot be wackin' off
I own New York like the back of my hand
You need to dance now cause I'ma bring back American Bandstand
Move out and flirt, watch folds attack front with private jet work
MTV front you in the back, you get jerked
Lose that record label and facin' hard smirk
You f'in around with the enterprise
Scotty is on, better roll with Captain Kirk
Puffin' debts in my face to get you hurt
Horace Gracy'll kick you in the back of your shirt
Rush you to Harlem Hospital, no jokes a riddle
What instrument you play, nothin's funky about a fiddle
Girls wanna come upstairs and waste my time and giggle

[Chorus]
New York girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Atlanta girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Chicago girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
L.A. girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Miami girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Detroit girls, they wanna hang
(I don't think that they want you)

[H-Bomb]
Homicidal links your nations
Hospitalized without identifications, low tolerations
Impossible situations, deliberations
Y'all got a deal?  Congratulations
Rotations, shocker
Ask Frankie Crocker, you knock her
Playboy photographer, star jock a curse
Rehearse, you get worse
Look and thirst, I burst
Like a Starburst purse
Fifty G's, chronic trees, ki's flew in from Belize, casualties
A heroin and speed, and trees
You naive, the game bleed
See your killers lead and mislead
Theodore Bundy, Theodore Kandinsky
Simply - murderin', don't tempt me
Shell me, clip full, unload 'til empty
Freestyle on simpty, centerfold's surround me
Jacky Jasper, two inch Ampec masters, these asses
Contract murderers bounce
Backpackers, Clive Davis renounce and announce
Freeze all accounts once
Y'all play this Game
Had the fame, things don't blow - explain things
Sustain, cash gains
We control your brains

[Chorus]
Dallas girls, they wanna hang out with me
Kentucky girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Memphis girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Denver girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Philly girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Virginia girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Austin girls, they wanna hang
(I don't think that they want you)

[Marc Live]
Yo, sit back, hold up, get back, give 'em that
No get back, retaliate - king of your city
Look out below, release the missile get you
Black truck loaded with five guys won't miss you
No time for lies, real thangs, fire missile
We got chicks too, we the pimps too
Box holes through, buy most too
Rhyme best, face off, open your chest (let 'em know)
K-H, nevertheless, murder the rest
It moves different in sick, you in the midst, yo
Yo where we at, where we go, how we spit
New York, 2010 with the twist shit
Your chick stripped to us, guys tip to us
Rolls flip to or drink fifth, trip to us

[Chorus]
Jersey girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Houston girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Tampa girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
South Carolina girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
North Carolina girls, they wanna hang out with me
(You really think they really want you?)
Cincinnati girls, they wanna hang
(I don't think that they want you)</pre>
