Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We are party people
We are what you call
Self made party monsters
So welcome to the bar

[Daddy X]
First of all
Like to welcome y'all
To the 13th annual Kottonmouth Ball

Round here anything goes
Whippies, Tippies, and Trickity Hoes

Bass tone
Rattle ya bones
SC tabs and fat bong loads

Sun goes up and comes back down
Got a little bit of everything floatin around

[The Dirtball]
We the Party Monsters setting the bar
Dedicated to substance abuse, take a whiff of my jar
It be the mix of a buncha different ways
To get down, cop a buzz, and then spray
Friends from the liquor that I'm poundin everyday

Right now, partied up on the way to the bar
So let's play

You take a shot, I take a shot, You take a shot, We take a shot
Hey

We are party people
We are what you call
Self made party monsters
So welcome to the bar

Party Monsters a special guest has just arrived
Please direct your attention to the red carpet
Here comes none other than the most sinister monster of them all, Tech N9ne

[Tech N9ne]
All the home girls love me at hooters
I'm straight Uber
MC searchin for that cooter
They know my roto rooter's
A straight shooter
So we dippin and she packin a fat booter

Baby all around the world I be hootin
Same time I be soozin out the ooshin
I mean ocean
I threw back a couple of cold ones
And I'm in motion
Party pulsing, then I'm pokin

Techa Nina gettin that loot, that we rolla
Haters see me and they try to shoot, their Evola
Cause I got their women, gettin lose
Every hoe I'm gettin wet cause I make them say, ooh Areola

We are party people
We are what you call
Self made party monsters
So welcome to the bar</pre>
