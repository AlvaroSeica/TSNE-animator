(lil one)
I drop bombs every day like Timothy McVeigh
I bust lyrics turnin motherfuckas into spirits
If you ever even try to get cleaver
forever you'll be gone see I got the fire one
right beneath my belt buckle both your knees buckle
I'm old and I'm cold but these stories gotta be told
I hold motherfuckas in fear
I'm Mr. Lil one so nobody comes near
I'm motivated I love the fact that you hate it
That I made it in the world where I'm always playa hated
I'm faded buzzin off my mind though I find no regrets
on this corpse that I left to the death
Is how I gotta fight when you motherfuckas rush in
Bustin outta crate cuz I'm knowin that you're fake
Can't escape all the hate that I feel up in my soul
I've been seekin out the situ but I got nowhere to go
Now what am I to do should I stay or se my mamma?
The baddest of them all I was born to see the drama

(Chorus x4)
You know what's wrong you're broke and dead torn
Now heres a mob hit comin into your song</pre>
