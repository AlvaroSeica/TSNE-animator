If your boy think tough

I'ma-slap that bitch (sho' is) If your boy running up
(Hoo!) I'ma-slap that bitch,(Hoo!) I'ma-slap that bitch,(Hoo!)
I'ma-slap that bitch (sho' is) When I find him in the club
(Hoo!) I'ma-slap that bitch,(Hoo!) I'ma-slap that bitch,(Hoo!)
I'ma-slap that bitch (sho' is) Cause I don't give a fuck
(Hoo!) I'ma-slap that bitch,(Hoo!) I'ma-slap that bitch,(Hoo!)
I'ma-slap that bitch (sho' is)

[Killa Kev]
Well I'm back, Killa Kev, and I'm gonna make you feel it
My rap-life been hurt and now it's time for me to heal it
You thought I was gone and I would never come back
But now you hear my name in lyrics all over this track
My folks alive cause I'm tight, I got you excite
I got a rifle cocked back for a punk Lil Wyte, let's fight
You thinkin' you tough, you thinkin' you buck
Well if you thinkin' that you harder than a killer, step up
And I can lyrically defeat you or physically beat you
But it don't matter either way, cause Killa gonna reach you
And I would give you credit, if you deserved it little bitch
But I'm honest, you ain't worth more than a dookie of shit, bitch
So what the fuck, go ahead and run your mouth
So I can get mad and knock your fuckin' teeth out
You got big balls, come back with a song
Cause I started this shit and now it's on

[Hook]

[Mac E]
Yo, most of these niggas be wanna-be killers
I got a bitch with clips to get at you niggas
And yall know I'm straight-up making it happen
way before I started rapping, I fucked with them original killers
Yo, and I got niggas that'll kill for pounds
All my niggas'll let off rounds, so play it smart
Cocksucker, ya boy don't play no games
Violate me, 6 shots to your brain
Yeah, and I'm repping the North
North Memphis, stand up
Yall get ya boy cause these niggas be
Sellin them tickets and know they ain't ready
I'm cocked and they heavy so bitches get at me, I'm not playin
Mac E be, low-key, 40 cal. tucked-in
No luck, you will lose, I'm real, fuck him
The new boy, got it locked for them foes
Mac E, I ain't playin with you hoes, I'm ready to roll

[Hook]

[Nick Scarfo]
It's Nicky Scarfo, mafioso
Bustin' niggas with the fo'-fo', fo' sho' doe, on the low doe
Murderer, killer, dealer, Nick Scarfo, real cap-peeler
Been running these streets, they don't run me
If a nigga run up, I let him feel the heat
From hot nine, slangin' hot ass iron
Tryin' to get some of mine, then bitch you dyin'
Prophet the Prophet the Prophet the Posse
On a killing spree, like some motherfuckin' nazis
And a boy keep on talkin', I'ma slap him up
And all these platinum plaques, I'm tryin' to rack 'em up
Cause I'm the boss nigga, of this Prophet shit
And went and rounded up, a brand-new click
So buckle up, I think you better sit back
And if you act like a bitch you gonna get slapped
