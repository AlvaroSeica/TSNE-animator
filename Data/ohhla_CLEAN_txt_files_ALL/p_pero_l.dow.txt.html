Yeah
Mr. Shadow up in this one
From SD to LA it's the Pocos Pero Locos way

Somos pocos pero locos better act like you know it
105.9 FM on your radio
From San Diego to the streets of LA
Golden State representing, can't have it no other way
Criminal state of mind, the 619 is where I grind
And this is where I live and I die
Brown Pride till the day we lay under the grass
And Rest In Peace to all my soldiers that were lost in the past
I'm going out with a blast, homey it's 2K1
You can find me in San Diego daily puffing on one
What you want from this bald headed fool
I thought you knew we're staying true up and down I-5 is how we do
Rendezvous at the station
Now what you know about Mr. Shadow and his people running the nation
The show that you waited for, everybody knows
At Power 106 somos pocos pero locos</pre>
