"What you gonna say?"
"Hello ..."

"Hey"
"What you gonna say?"
"Hey"

[Break]
Greg: Hello Career Finders, Greg speaking, may I help you?
T: Oh, I'm T-Nut
T: I'm T-Dog, T-Nut Penitentiary 
Greg: Um, ok
T: T-Dog Nut, Killer T
Greg: What are your special areas of interest?

[Verse 1 - Mr. Lif] (Akrobatik) {Mighty Dollar}
(Yo, I pump crack), you fill cracks? (No, I pump 'em)
Whoa, I think you got too personal or somethin
So, you're livin an alternative lifestyle
(Nah nigga, I sell crack in little viles)
Hmm, I think I got the perfect job for you
Go home and raise your kids and stay the fuck out the booth
(Hey yo, fuck you) (next!) Why you lookin all vexed?
What's your skill? (Everyday I blast niggaz with tecs)
Can you use an AK? (Hell yeah!) Is that a fact?
Ak, pull up the plan and get this kid to Iraq
State your name {Mighty Dollar} (*laughing*) {What's so funny?}
Nothin {son, I'm known to get money}
Yeah, it says right here you rhyme excessively 
About cash as if everyday's a fuckin spendin spree
Maybe consider Accounting or Banking
Or maybe it's time to start doin the glam thing
It's played out, oh my God, he hasn't noticed yet
Leave the mic alone and pass the rhymin to the vets, next
Fuck that, matter fact close the office
These lost black zombie niggaz makin me nauseous

[Chorus - Akrobatik] - 2X
(Career Finders)
Leave that life of rap behind yo
We got somethin to suit you finer (We're Career Finders)
Put them pipe dreams on the shelf
And let us put you on the right path to wealth

[Verse 2 - Humpty Hump]
(Hello Career Finders"), yeah, I'm lookin for a position
Special talent, I'm really good at dissin
I bug it to on a pen and ten mission
Kindness and discipline is all that I'm missin
(But I) I want to get paid
I got these flows, the record that I made, help me get laid
Okay, let's see Mr. Disser
Mr. nine millimeter pump fixer
You're interested in being richer
Without no work, I'll put you down as a wisher
Wait, did I mention I can roll weed in a swisher?
Hmm, I'll put you down as a wisher (dreams)
So, this is what we got
Your good at pointin out who's a bitch and who's not
You ain't scared, down to shoot up the spot
Have you thought about the military, or a cop?
You make a good bank robber, you like to be the star ship man?
Well what about a hitman?
Gotta give it to you, when it comes to hard, you the hardest
We're just not sure if your an artist

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Akrobatik]
Uh, yo, instead of makin records, havin everybody nervous
Maybe we can get you somethin with the Secret Service
Many applicants frown when they first heard this
But what's bein an artist got to do with doin murders?
You want to bust guns, here's some fly shit
A war's goin on, be a front line private
Yeah, you could be a hero in Iraq
Or be the cat that stop the next plane from bein hijacked (damn)
But you want to party hard
Instead of bein a rapper, maybe you could be a bodyguard
Or maybe work a detail at Mardi Gras
A chaperon at the night bar, where the hotties are
You a typical applicant
With everything you say you do, it make me wonder why you want to rap and shit
I'm a put your resume back in the cabinet
Find another path, Career Finders ain't havin it

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Greg: What are your special areas of interest?

(*laughing*)
