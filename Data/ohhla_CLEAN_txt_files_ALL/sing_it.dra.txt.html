Song:   Sing It (The Life of Riley)
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

See, it all started with my dad
If he rated anything I always hated it
With one catch the beauty of life
He played Grandmaster Flash and Furious Five
It was the message
And I guess that meant more than anything I was given
From him, maybe the rhythm within
Or given my similar sisters
Living for the resistance, we listen to systems pumping out
Jump around, to Rage Against The Machine
Fuck the police by NWA, we played the Grave Diggers
To Nirvana's Smelling Like Teen Spirit
And they sing it with every little bit of last breath that is in them
Yes and they listen, yes and they love it,
Yes and they live it, yes they

Singing along, they singing along
A new day, a new dawn
A place to forget about the world you're on and get the whole crowd
Singing along, they singing along
You can't change it, it's set in stone
And I ain't saying we need to get along
Just let the whole crowd sing it

It all started as a young'n, hanging around at Hunter's flat
Once where the warriors and monsters rapped
I sat back taking it in - destined to win it
Had all of SBX as my next of kin
It was a blessing that manifested from being a guest on Done DL
That and the help from the Hydey
In '99 I had an I.D
Only 17 but saying I was 19
Hide when the cops would rock in
Nothing could stop me watching I wouldn't give in
Cause from the beginning I was living for the sound
When you walk into the room and the whole crowd singing along

Singing along, they singing along
A new day, a new dawn
A place to forget about the world you're on and get the whole crowd
Singing along, they singing along
You can't change it, it's set in stone
And I ain't saying we need to get along
Just let the whole crowd sing it

Well, well look what we got here
We here to lock ears like ruggedous rottweilers
And well then why would I stop here
The day I stopped hearing the haters it got clearer
And I feared as a bearded Ned Kelly
If I would stop selling could never just stop telling em my story
Pauly walked up in here with nothing
Enough to never trust another loving Jimmy Loughnan
Cause I got these friends that will stick around
If it ever ended were there in the beginning
And then these friends in the crowd I'm surrounded by,
Together we all sing it

Singing along, they singing along
A new day, a new dawn
A place to forget about the world you're on and get the whole crowd
Singing along, they singing along
You can't change it, it's set in stone
And I ain't saying we need to get along just let the whole crowd sing it </pre>
