Typed by: JesseAbraham212@gmail.com

[Verse 1]
I find it odd
That I've been awed
Ahhh shit
By and large
It's a timeless wit that I rhyme with
I'm involved with a mindless grind that a firing squad could define as a crisis
When the mic is on minus papyrus I am your highness, I am God
Wait that's pious, I am wrong
Try and define this virus, my that's hard
What virus? Microsoft?
I'm on when I'm off
It's a blanket wrapped like I'm Linus, dog
Peanuts is a childish style
You could file these nuts under bison balls slash Tyson's arm
I'm a make you dash like a hyphen
When I write a song, go

[Hook]

Jaybrah Jaybrah spit that shit
Show them who they messin with
Who you think you are, who you, who you think you are?
I ain't shit
Who you think you are, who you, who you think you are?
I'm the shit
Jaybrah Jaybrah spit that shit
Show them who they messin with
Say whatchu wanna say
Act how you wanna act
Play how you wanna play
Rap how you wanna rap

[Verse 2]
Think I expect to get props?
It's not a total shock
Not like I'm rockin dreadlocks and drinkin soda pop
I mean I'm kinda legit
I ain't just tryin to fit
I deserve it
It's fair, right?
No it's not
No guaranteeing survival
Most of y'all just feel entitled
Emcees that I know just like rhyming
They would wave a title
Diss your disciples' idols
I will become unbridled and rival
Anyone who spits shit that's recycled at their concert, show, recital
I'm blessed to have a mic
Lucky stars, satellites
Fucking starved, appetite
I'm hungry so I sacrifice my down time
Afterlife? Yeah now's mine
Hermaphrodites can't even dream to please themselves like how I'm
Smiling when I'm rhymin I'm a giant and it's chow time
Frying up a lion throwin down a pound of Ballantine's
Now it's mine (psyche)
I made ya look
Underground? Musta made your luck
Underground like a miner with a major, look

[Hook]

Jaybrah Jaybrah spit that shit
Show them who they messin with
Who you think you are, who you, who you think you are?
I ain't shit
Who you think you are, who you, who you think you are?
I'm the shit
Jaybrah Jaybrah spit that shit
Show them who they messin with
Say whatchu wanna say
Act how you wanna act
Play how you wanna play
Rap how you wanna rap

[Verse 3]
It's type strange
That anybody listens
I'm forever grateful for a moment of your attention
I'm sittin on the subway
It's my train of thought
A token of my appreciation is all you really bought
When you copped a song or somethin
Or sung along or somethin
Or told me years ago, "Jesse man you're onto somethin"
I'm buzzin?
You're buggin
Just cuz your cousin's husband liked my album don't mean nothin
Maybe it does?
It doesn't
That ain't the voice of haters
Y'all go ahead with that
You're braggin bout your haters like it's an impressive stat
Man you ain't bein hated cuz you're innovative, Jack
If you get so much hate
Maybe your shit's just wack
That's not about a artist
It's bout livin a life
The show starter
Bob Barker, tell em, how's that price?
The price is wrong, bitch
This ain't a free show
It's a freak show
Now sing along, it's

[Hook]
Jaybrah Jaybrah spit that shit
Show them who they messin with
Who you think you are, who you, who you think you are?
I ain't shit
Who you think you are, who you, who you think you are?
I'm the shit
Jaybrah Jaybrah spit that shit
Show them who they messin with
Say whatchu wanna say
Act how you wanna act
Play how you wanna play
Rap how you wanna rap</pre>
