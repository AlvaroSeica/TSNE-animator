[Masta Ace]
I be one of the best in this rappety rap
And I'm sick of all this yakkey yak
We don't see y'all when we beez overseas then, after we back
We realize that you had to be whack - that explains it
That's the reason why the fans don't be effin wit'chu
Killin the culture - never shoulda left it wit'chu
That's the first thing, here's the second issue
The city on your back like a Ness &amp; Mitchell
But you about as soft as a pack of tissue
I'm a lion, you a lamb dog, sacrificial
The label said you will never sell again
Ran up a big bill like a pelican
That's crazy cash - you're "Clueless" like Stacey Dash
Dude - I'm nice, better tell a friend
that my name right there again
What you be? I be more like Maryland
My team on your neck like a ascot
And you be the mascot like a Terrapin
You move slow like a turtle do
And yo I heard a few dudes wanna murder you
Y'all drop; claiming y'all that real hip-hop
Yeah? I only feel like a third of you
.. nah I'm wrong the percentage lower
I come in first, you come in like a minute slower
Damn~! Now on the track, that's a mismatch
And my voice through the speaker's like a dispatch
Loud and clear, moms so proud and yeah
that's the reason there's a crowd in here, c'mon

"Cause ain't no things comin in between me and my dream
 see what I mean?" - Big L
"It's real hip-hop" - Common

[Masta Ace]
Two times for your mind like therapy
Another man like me you will never see
It's that BK pedigree
Cats wan' try and follow the A like the letter B
But y'all choose them dudes instead of me
That's cool, I don't complain, I just "Let it Be"
like a Beatles song - I believe in yesterday
Understand, I don't play like the needle's gone
Shout to deejays everywhere
That boy tours, he plays everywhere
Even when the man falls gotta have balls
and in my drawers of course got a heavy pair
Now put some weight on it; how you wishin
you can do what I do, turn around, try to hate on it?
That makes absolutely no sense
You ain't got a clue dog, no prints

[DJ Dister scratches to the end]
"From the soul y'all" - Common</pre>
