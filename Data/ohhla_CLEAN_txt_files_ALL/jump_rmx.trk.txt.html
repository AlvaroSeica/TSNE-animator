Typed by: @TrekLife @MelloMusicGroup

Man what you waitin on?
You want the success fairy to come and sprinkle more?
You think your dreams are gone fall from the sky
With no effort
You feel like you should ball til you die
Ok,
Why you complainin then?
When you lose but you never did play to win
Got everybody to blame from God down to friends
Got every reason to pack up and let it end
Who's fault is it?
When you die without, ever once livin
You had dreams but you never did go get em'
Trippin, thumbin your nose at the positive and
The world is all yours
Put it down, get it now, what you waitin on
Quit lookin for the world to be fair
It's yo' life have it all dog jump out there

(chorus)
You got a problem with a nigga homie "jump out there"
You tryin to get this dough nigga "Jump out there"
You tryin to get at these broads mayne "Jump out there"
You tryin to kick these flows nigga "jump out there"
AInt nothing given gotta take it homie "jump out there"
A closed mouth don't get fed "jump out there"
You gotta fake it til you make it nigga "jump out there"
No doubt get bread homie "jump out there"

You think that you the greatest they'll tell you that you the worse
You feel you innovative they'll yell "he aint the first"
Trippin': Why ever listen to what other folks kickin?
Cuz niggas be bitchin
There's always somebody who's dissin shit
Cuz misery needs somebody to kick it with
My own 2 that's my whole crew
We hold each other down winning or lose
Through the thick and thin
I put feelings aside I know who I am and I don't look to nobody else for definition
Because them doubters wont cheer when you get paid
And when you win they gone still have something to say
People request: How you make it Trek?
I tell em left foot right foot homie you gotta take a step
Don't ever be discouraged or scared
All people got is words mayne jump out there

You got a problem with a nigga homie "jump out there"
You tryin to get this dough nigga "Jump out there"
You tryin to get at these broads mayne "Jump out there"
You tryin to kick these flows nigga "jump out there"
AInt nothing given gotta take it homie "jump out there"
A closed mouth don't get fed "jump out there"
You gotta fake it til you make it nigga "jump out there"
No doubt get bread homie "jump out there"

Hold up let me understand you a grown man
Who secretly has problems with another man
That you never met before never shook his hand
And never held a conversation even though you can
You a disgrace to manhood, straight waste of skin
I don't play with kids
Keep your little mean mugg that don't make me fear
Not a molecule of you and let me make this clear
That's what little high school cheerleaders do
And you a chump
You need to trade your dunks for pumps
Give that nigga SB Manolos or something
You a broad you should dance in a cage at clubs
You and every nigga like you
Get a life dude
You aint gotta hate him for her to like you
A cold stare but you wont come near
Anytime, anywhere nigga jump out there

(Chorus)
You got a problem with a nigga homie "jump out there"
You tryin to get this dough nigga "Jump out there"
You tryin to get at these broads mayne "Jump out there"
You tryin to kick these flows nigga "jump out there"
AInt nothing given gotta take it homie "jump out there"
A closed mouth don't get fed "jump out there"
You gotta fake it til you make it nigga "jump out there"
No doubt get bread homie "jump out thereÂ”</pre>
