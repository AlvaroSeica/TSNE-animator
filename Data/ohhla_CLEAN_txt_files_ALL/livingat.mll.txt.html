[Meek Mill]
Yea... You can b here one day gon any minute

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well
You could be here one day
gon in a minute
cause life is so short but it's own as a minute see I'm (see I'm)
I'm juss living at the speed of light (Juss Livin)
juss living at the speed of light
N I would neva waste a minute
I'm neva giving up and I'm breakin every limit cause I'm (cause I'm)
I'm juss living at the speed of light (yea)
I'm juss living at the speed of light

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Speedin in the fast lane watchin thru my rearview
thinkin bout the past man and all the shit I did do
shit dat coulda took my life from me
dat I lived thru
cases dat I coulda caught cracks dat I done slid thru the bids too
struggles I done came from the main one
was the day my dad died I neva been the same son
turned into a man young cause I ain't understand sumthen
changes I was brought thru streets dat I was forced to
u could b here one day gon in a minute
dats y I get dat money spend it like I print it
ball to I fall
till the day I deminish
I ain't neva gon stop I push it to the limit

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well
You could be here one day
gon in a minute
cause life is so short but it's own as a minute see I'm (see I'm)
I'm juss living at the speed of light (Juss Livin)
juss living at the speed of light
N I would neva waste a minute (Neva)
I'm neva giving up and I'm breakin every limit cause I'm (cause I'm)
I'm juss living at the speed of light (yea)
I'm juss living at the speed of light

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Dey gav my nigga twenty years man dey wasn't evn right

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
From where the good die young
n the bad don't evn last at
where the young niggaz 16 and ova die fast at
I was made derr and raised derr but moved past dat
livin at the speed of light it look like a flashback
I done got money
went broke and got the cash back
had it I was cool tho
lost it I got laughed at
dats y I neva eva cherish nuthen I can hav bac
thank you for my life tho I wish dat I can stash dat
yea
shit I'm juss livin at the speed of light
ballin hard to see the light b here today decease the night
I juss hope wen GOD come arrest me dat he read my rights read my wrongs keep me right
send me home but leave me right.

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Well
You could be here one day
gon in a minute
cause life is so short but it's own as a minute see I'm (see I'm)
I'm juss living at the speed of light juss living at the speed of light
N I would neva waste a minute I'm neva giving up and I'm breakin every limit cause I'm (cause I'm)
I'm juss living at the speed of light I'm juss living at the speed of light</pre>
