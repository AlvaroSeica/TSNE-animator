[Intro: DJ Drama]
Studies say humans forget 90% of their dream, upon the first 10 minutes of waking
{"Cardo on the beat!"} They say most people don't even remember, 99% of the dreams they ever even had
{"Cardo on the beat!"} Haheh, as Dreamchasers, we're the exception

[Meek Mill]
Hundred grand large on the watch, blessed; quarter mil for the Mulsanne, flex
All my niggas gon' cash, checks, and all y'all niggas look mad, stressed
And we ain't even made niggas mad, yet, cause next time I grab, I'ma grab, jet
I might go Bugatti with a bad bitch beside me, nigga hotter than wasabi, get that ass, wet
Young niggas goin' hard in the streets, we ain't ever known to call the police
Got birds for the twenty-five K (WOO!) sounds like a bargain to me
Young niggas gettin' money in the Bent, leather lookin' like Spalding to me
And I don't know what no line look like; hundred bad bitches gettin' all in with me
Get 'em all in for free; started, started with a quarter ounce of hard rock
And now I got a lot of cars, if a nigga talk the foreigns, got a car lot
And everybody talkin' money but they ain't showing numbers like the call block
And all I do is count money, fuck pretty ass hoes, and car shop

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Yeah nigga I'm leanin', leanin'; young rich nigga, I'm leanin'
Puffin' on strong, gettin' gold, bad bitches lookin' like Nia Long, I mean it
Nigga I'm leanin', leanin'; young rich nigga, I'm leanin'
Sippin' on promethazine that nigga; my team got money all season
Nigga I'm leanin'...

[Travis Scott]
Mmm, leanin' -- damn near spilled my semen (straight up)
Had a twenty-twenty on my preacher wife, damn near see my demons (La Flame!)
Loose furs, hyenas, for the love of money and Selena
Vatos losin' their nerves, there's bird niggas on the curbs and let 'em pull up and do the Macarena (AHHHHH~!!)
H-Town niggas spilled Peach Crush on my jeans (nope)
Never go far with no bitch with no condoms unless they can cover the lease on my Beamer (straight up)
Ahh, you know, Louboutins don't touch my hoes (La Flame)
Let's go down in Ibiza town, we get cold, you don't need no coat
Mu'fucker, I'm leanin' (dope); don't talk to me, couple street niggas think twice before crossin' me (oh no)
Meek, these niggas shit can't last that long, why these motherfuckers keep botherin' me? (straight up)
I'm leanin', for a minute you had me then the second I caught it when it passed me
Oh no (straight up) somebody pass me a blunt and a double world cup
Mu'fucker, mu'fucker I'm...

[Chorus]

[Outro One: Birdman - echoing] + (Meek Mill)
Yeah, straight lovers to this life, nigga; parlay or nothin'
See we started trappin' before we was rappin', and then we was, trappin' and rappin'
Shining on these hoes, high life, hah
This what we live now - blowin' out the pound, heh, Italian on the floor nigga
Ya understand me? Steppin' onto a mil' nigga
(They say money rule the world, you can't pay God with it)
Step your game up nigga or lose your bitch nigga
It's just that simple...

[Outro Two: Diddy - echoing]
Yeah, we Dreamchasers
We out there gettin' this money so you can't fuck with everybody
Cause everybody ain't at you motherfuckin' level so the motherfuckers that don't understand you
They wind up motherfuckin' hatin' you, and so you know what you gotta do
And so you gotta hate those motherfuckers too
Fuck them niggas, fuck they motherfuckin' mommas
They daddies, they aunts, they uncles and they little tee-tees, too
Ayo, suck a dick; Meek Mills, let's get it</pre>
