[Intro]
I'd like to welcome y'all back to Mississippi, heh
Damn, I miss y'all niggaz, hahaha!
We just want y'all to know.. (Lord save us)
God for the, thugs too my nigga.. YEA!

[Chorus]
This is for my thug niggaz, all the pimps and the drug dealers 
Thieves and the motherfuckin killers (Lord save us) 
YEA! The ones who ain't never had shit 
That's why we get crunk in this bitch, YEA!
This is for my thug niggaz, all the pimps and the drug dealers 
Thieves and the motherfuckin killers (Lord save us) 
YEA! The ones who ain't never had shit 
That's why we get crunk in this bitch, YEA!

[David Banner]
Daddy in the pen, momma out suckin dick
I ain't never had fam, so I ride wit my clique
Said I'll die for my clique, jealous hoes die too
I woulda been a lawyer by the age of 22 
but I won't so I don't give a FUCK about killin you! 
I'll sell crack too, I will jack, dude! 
I dropped out of school to buy my daughter some food
And her momma don't live around here no mo'
They took her life when they kicked in my do' 
Yellin, "Bitch, where the dope?!" and BLAOW BLAOW BLAOW! 
They thought I was a beast, tell the bitch look now!
I'ma smoke my weed! I'ma fuck me a hoe!
I'ma want yo' dope! I'ma kick yo' do'!
I'ma slap yo' hoe! I'ma take yo' yay!
When I'm thinkin 'bout the Lord I got to SEE one day..
Sorry.. damn!

[Chrous]

[David Banner]
I'ma get me a 'Lac, I'ma ride down 10 
I'ma pray to the Lord I won't die in the pen
Got to serve for my sins, I'ma serve me a caca
I gotta watch my back for them fuckin undercovers (YEA!)
{*tires screech*} FUCK the cops! {*panting and gunshots*}
Fuck them pigs! {*gunshots*} Kill me a motherf- {*gunshots*}
{*laughs*} ...BITCH! Yea!
I'ma come to the crib I'ma flood my block 
I'ma ride downtown, yellin, "Fuck Trent Lott!"
They done rape grandmomma, they done took our land
Now they wonder why a nigga don't give a hot... (YEA!) ...damn!
Damn! (..the fuck?) (YEA! YEA!)
