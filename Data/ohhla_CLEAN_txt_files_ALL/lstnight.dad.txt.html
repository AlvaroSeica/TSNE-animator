Last night (last night)
I couldn't even get an answer (Answer)
I tried to call (I tried to call)
But my pride wouldn't let me dial
(dial, dial, dial)
And I'm sitting here (sitting here)
With this blank expression (expression, expression, expression)
And the way I feel (way I feel)
I wanna curl up like a child (child, child)

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
god please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

[Keyshia Cole]
If I told you once
I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out
with nothing to say
your everything I want it to be
If you could only see
your heart belongs to me
I love you so much
I'm hurting for your touch
come and set me free
forever yours I'll be
baby won't you come
and take this pain away

[Chorus]
Last night (last night)
I couldn't even get an answer (Answer)
(you said you couldn't get an answer baby)
I tried to call (I tried to call)
but my pride wouldn't let me dial (Dial)
(but that should never stopped you)
And I'm sitting here (sitting here)
(sitting there)
with this blank expression (expression)
(I'll be with ya my baby)
and the way I feel
(way I feel)
I wanna curl up like a child (child)
(ooh baby...oh no)

[Keyshia Cole]
I need you
and you need me
this is so plain to see
and I would never let you go
and I will always love you so... I will
If you could only see
your heart belongs to me
I love you so much
I'm hurting for your touch
come and set me free
forever yours I'll be
baby won't you come
and take this pain away

[Chorus]
Last night (last night)
(oh last night)
I couldn't even get an answer (Answer)
(oh baby baby wanna do this to me... hey)
I tried to call (I tried to call)
(alright)
but my pride wouldn't let me dial (dial)
(why wouldn't you just dial me baby... Oh)
And I'm sitting here (sitting here)
with this blank expression (expression)
(Don't Say anything baby... oh no, oh no)
and the way I feel
(alright)
I wanna curl up like a child (child)
(I'm soo alone, I'm soo lonely baby oh)

[diddy]
tell me what..
what else to say
to make you comeback
and break me like that
and if it matters
what matters if it don't
we can go never ever alone
don't wanna wait til you go
tonight when (??????)
just don't leave me

[chorus]
Last night (last night)
(...yeah...)
I couldn't even get an answer (Answer)
(couldn't Even Answer Baby...Oh)
I tried to call (tried to call)
(call me baby)
but my pride wouldn't let me dial (dial)
(why couldn't you just dial me baby, baby, baby, baby Baby Baby)
And I'm sitting here (sitting here)
with this blank expression (expression)
(Don't say a thing... no)
and the way I feel
(alright)
I wanna curl up like a child (child)
(I'm soo alone, I'm soo lonely baby... oh)

[Keyshia Cole]

and I would never let you go
and I will always love you so...i will
If you could only see (only see)
your heart belongs to me (heart belongs to me)
I love you so much (oh)
I'm hurting for your touch (Oh)

and dial up my number
