Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Warcloud]
You find ya self devoured by woodland creatures
Lightin' matches under my hat, ghost pirates
Frosty mug of rum

[Warcloud]
Old Los Angeles, heroin epidemics
I bust slugs, they love to figure skate through me
We had a merry war, turn M.C.'s to cannon boys
I carved Wu-Tang in the tie, you heard the stabbin' noise
Raw head breaks, snake eater of dungeon
A web of dead bodies in the sewer, underground London
Passion in the desert, my guns'll love backwards
Just around the royal staircase, he runs laughter
Just around the royal staircase, he runs laughter
My forearm is made out of rifles that bust factor
And pop might murder the woman in the here after
I laugh cuz I'm a pirate, shot you twice in the abdomen
Then opened up the back of his head, like a cabinet
The blood sprained into my face
And ran down my revolver like the gaze of the next victim I slaughtered
Caught within a second, he wandered down the tunnel
Feel the ghost of a little boy rammed by, at the end
I squeeze a trigger violent, Warcloud the tyrant
All wet wit blood, on Godly assignment
Slap a whipper snapper, ya's better mount up and slither
I smack you like a bear, watch a salmon out of a river

[Chorus 2X: Warcloud]
Roll him up in the carpet, carry him up the staircase
Ghost Pirates, Old Los Angeles, and we're fabulous
Rhyme biohazardous, shot him twice in the abdomen
Then opened up the back of his head, like a cabinet

[Skarekrow]
My liquids drip through ya storm drains, stained window sills
Black feathered birds gathered in the back of the cornfield
Stuck like a quicksand on rich land
While apostle tried to translate the novels in the palm of my hand
I break training wheels and kick stands
Produced clones of myself in one hair strand
Live in stereo, perform miracles at ya burial
One shot from a crust roll is enough to scare ya sterile
Mars apply, blank at ya eyes in the skies
While I'm on the low, tip towin' through the shadows
Settin' the stage for my entrance
When I hit the street, smoke leavin' me like incense
Intense events, shiny instruments
Got you duckin' my buckin', my introduction is deep moans and groans
Screamin' bone collector, soul resurrector
Bloody whore show records, swoop down and take ya man's hands like checkers
Ya all left beheaded by the dreaded Skarekrow
Fiery war chants givin' oak branch elbows
Stone bones staircase, my home and air base
You misplaced, now which way do you go?
Yo, I jump and bite ya Adam's apple
The air hits thirty three below
You trapped wit the iceman made of hot snow
Old clothes, innocent blood, throw in a cemetery club

[Chorus 2X]

[Warcloud]
Trees, whose fruits wither it, without fruit, that art's twice dead
The sleepy old man, who dips his head
He said "I have a bat in my belt for ya and a baseball in my bed"
A skeleton, loadin' revolver in a snowstorm
Vampire walk in the studio in my ghost form
Feet in the mud, my slugs are like thugs
That get all up in you at twilight, like street serpents
Gape into the future, wit black markets, ya organs
Hand the project kid some loot and a pair of Jordans
Block head niggas, my pawn, ya'll get a hold of that
In the red rams, red boulders, watch the ogre's hat
The long shadow, hard rain in America
Cantaloupes fall out of ya back from cannon raps
You leave the scene bloody, I'm haywire and nutty
Warcloud, who bit off them bees and got muddy
Now I lounge on the track wit the Skarekrow
Get knuckle sandwich delicacy, and it's real, as the hallway
Gats sunk to me, let's murder some more web heads
An old jagged fence where ya hang ya clothes to dry

[Skarekrow]
Thank God, we bust, blow clutch, put big green in unnamed trust
Miscellaneous, my code name alias
Word archery, armory, perform tracks surgery
Givin' you brain strains and lower back pains
When you talk, I cover ya tongue like fat daddy shoe strings
Blow ya game in the grain wit stainless styles
Black Angus, stoned off by igneous, enemy lust
Left them all in the dust, now must
You keep playin' ya self, and claim you payin' dues
You the type, go head, rush out, and tell old news
Wouldn't know the delphonics if I left you clues
Tangled and strangled in the game of 'snap fool'
I seen more life in a statue, uh
And the truth hurts like body piercings and tattoo
My mental strength is chemically natural, physically impossible
To be recreated, upgraded and duplicated, formats fat and saturated
You must have heard too many shots when the ghost pirates raided

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Warcloud]
Immortal battalion wit pirates ship and a ghost crew
Explosives twisted in my being</pre>
