Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This yo favorite song, song
This yo favorite song, song
Turn yo jukebox on

Baby I'm a take you some where fresh
Soon as I get my next paycheck
Baby trust me, you'll see
Have ya girls wishin' they man was like me
So won't you take my hand
Baby close yo eyes
And we'll make love 'til we see the sun rise
On the beach though, with white sand
I promise forever, I'm yo man

So just rock to the left
And rock to the right
If you know yo baby gon' make it alright
Say oh...
And let me see you step to the front
And step to the back
And throw your hands up if you got it like that
Say oh...

Let's get gone, gone, gone, gone
Let's get gone
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Let's get gone, gone, gone, gone
Let's get gone
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
See I may not have the most money in the world
But I got stacks and love for you girl
As soon I get my money right
Then we'll go where ever you like
Get gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you

Baby I'm a take you somewhere fly
Somewhere far where we can't even drive
Where we go, only we know
I thinkin' Montego or Rio
I swear that as soon as I get my money right
We gon' catch a plane way high in the sky
No coach class when we fly
I'm thinkin' like G4 or G5

So just rock to the left
And rock to the right
If you know yo baby gon' make it alright
Say oh...
And take one step to the front
And one to the back
And throw your hands up if you got it like that
Say oh...

Let's get gone, gone, gone, gone
Let's get gone
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Let's get gone, gone, gone, gone
Let's get gone
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
See I may not have the most money in the world
But I got stacks and love for you girl
As soon I get my money right
Then we'll go where ever you like
Get gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you

If you believe
Then you will see
That girl we'll go
Around the globe, yeah
Just give me time
That's all I need, yeah
But until then
Let's watch this here TV
And let's get gone, gone, gone, gone
Let's get gone
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Let's get gone, gone, gone, gone
Let's get gone
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
See I may not have the most money in the world
But I got stacks and love for you girl
As soon I get my money right
Then we'll go where ever you like
Get gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
Yeah me and you
