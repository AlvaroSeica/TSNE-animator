Album:  The Take Over
Song:   Get Right to It
Typed by: Lil Hustle

Whoa, it's just another S.U.C. party...

[Chorus - 2x]
If you want to, we can do it
Lil' mama, let's get right to it
See I'm gone off Patron, and Dom Perignon
When we leave the club, let's get right to it

[Lil' O]
Hey baby we can do it, we can do it do it well
I love a jazzy broad, booty bigger than a whale
You got a pretty face, but it's something bout your tail
And if you let me hit your tail, boo I promise I won't tell
So tell me what it do, you say you love to screw the click
But do you love the Screw, I'm just talking bout music
But if you love dick bitch, I know how to use it
Beat it up good, won't you let me abuse it
Cause you know that you want it
Take you to the house, and stang like a hornet
In the streets we friends, in the bed we opponents oh you think it's a game
Baby round for round, lil' mama it's going down
Everytime I smoke wood it's kush, call it georgy porgy
Roll it up and pass it round, watch me at the orgy
After we smoke, she say she got some'ing for me
Sipping on Exception, she said pour me some more please

[Chorus - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
I fall in the club, in the V.I.P.
All eyes on me, like P-A-C
Sugar daddy, like P-A-T
It's H-A-Dub, of the S.U.C.
Do you see, what I see
A bad flock of hoes, and they looking at me
Well since I'm a G, on my G-A-M-E
I'ma buy the bar, all drinks on me
Some want Goose, some shots of Patron
Some wanna skip drinks, and go straight to my home
Now I'm in a zone, and a dog want a bone
And it won't be long, hoe we gon' get it on
7-60, and I'm sitting on chrome
And male groupies, I don't condone
I know I'm well known, and you love my songs
But with all due respect, I'm chasing after thongs
I might be wrong, so excuse me for that
You still my dog, but I'm out here for cat
So please back back, while I go on and act
And see how many chicks, that H.A.W.K. can attract

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
