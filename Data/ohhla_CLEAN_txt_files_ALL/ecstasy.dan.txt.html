[Rick Ross]
It started with a Monte Carlo
Then went and got a Beamer
Her mom call me a D-Boy
She said "Yes, he is a dreamer"
Two tickets to the matinee
Me and shorty way back in the day
Now she's into films
Our thing just starts to dim

Ah, ah, ah...

You know when you dealing with a Bad Boy baby
I got to keep it Trilla
Even if it hurt, you know?

[Rick Ross]
I won't sing to you like Chris and Ne-Yo
But I'm fresher than a stick of deo
Take you to the place where the chef is Creole
Black beach right next to Rio
Running out the house just to flip the ---
Dice in my pocket, I'm with the Cee-lo
Pull up to the crib and I hit the horn *honk honk*
Beep beep, Rick Dinero (Ross)
In the quick Gallardo
That's right, let me flip the car do'
In the wheel, might hit Chicago
She might pick the cargo
Let's skip Apollo
Carlo Briar is my Picasso
We ride or die
She my little vato (Boss)

[Aubrey]
Can't hold it back, you know I'm so addicted to you
Cravings attack whenever I get closer to you
I'm in withdrawals whenever you're away
I just want you here with me boy

[Aundrea]

Hop in my coup√©, I only got a room for two
Let's just explore
My only destination is you

[Shannon]
The mood is set, my temperature is rising
I'm getting hot and there ain't no denying (No)
I know a spot where can just go get lost together right now
And do whatever

[D Woods]
You take me high but I really want to go (Low)
Hearts beating fast yet we still moving (Slow)
Let back the seat
And boy just take control
Come on, won't you let me know

Boy you got me twisted, I must admit it
I just can't resist, can't get you off my senses
You make me feel brand new
The things you do
Oh, you know that I'm fiendin' for you

I just got to have it, it's getting drastic
I can't break the habit, I'm just an addict
For your love
Just like a drug
Baby let me take you to
