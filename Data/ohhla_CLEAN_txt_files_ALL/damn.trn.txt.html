Typed by: prepschoolproductions@gmail.com

[Chorus]
DAMN!
[How you get that whip like that? ]
DAMN!
[...How you stacking chips like that?]
DAMN!
[...How you getting chicks like that?]
...CAUSE I'M SICK LIKE THAT, I GET SHIT LIKE THAT...
DAMN!
I be pushing whips like that...
DAMN!
I be stacking chips like that...
DAMN!
I be getting chicks like that...
...CAUSE I'M SICK LIKE THAT, I GET SHIT LIKE THAT...

[E-TRAIN]
Im climbing up the charts, catching bars
Watch your sales fail
Riding out in 911 porsche
With the whale tail
Buy all types of sports, cars, bars and vintage coups
Throwback Ferrar's is parked in my living room
Pull the lack back
Wind grain on my finger
Hit the knob like a fader
Pull it up into my hanger
Train's planes and automobiles take up acres
And book shelves move so y'all can see my secret liar

[Chorus]
DAMN!
[...How you get that whip like that? ]
DAMN!
[...How you stacking chips like that?]
DAMN!
[...How you getting chicks like that?]
...CAUSE I'M SICK LIKE THAT, I GET SHIT LIKE THAT...
DAMN!
I be pushing whips like that...
DAMN!
I be stacking chips like that...
DAMN!
I be getting chicks like that...
...CAUSE I'M SICK LIKE THAT, I GET SHIT LIKE THAT...

[Verse 2]
Aces in my basement 
got my place looking cold as shit
Red velvet cloakin it
Cinaplex Odeium 
Purple room
Herbal room
If you need to tote a grip
Peace nah
G5 
Bought it from the Olsen twins
think it's a Mercedes?...
No it looks Range Rover-ish
Minks for the ladies
The muts is what I'm strollin in
Boss floss
Im a buyer
And bet your English muffins
Im flyer than Merry Poppin's

[Chorus]
DAMN!
[...How you get that whip like that? ]
DAMN!
[...How you stacking chips like that?]
DAMN!
[...How you getting chicks like that?]
...CAUSE I'M SICK LIKE THAT, I GET SHIT LIKE THAT...
DAMN!
I be pushing whips like that...
DAMN!
I be stacking chips like that...
DAMN!
I be getting chicks like that...
...CAUSE I'M SICK LIKE THAT, I GET SHIT LIKE THAT...

[VERSE 3]
All black Carerra
A vixen's toy
Not Sean MacNemera
But Christian Troy
And a death threats in the mail
That rappers 'gon murder me
That's when I tell 'em
Come in
For free plastic surgery
Bangin'
Keep the aiming
Got to Train it just to earn a keep
Got cake
Save it
I'm rocking David Yurman bling
V-12
Female
Y'all ain't never heard of me
The sea-shells
He sells
Retails like German V's

[Chorus]
DAMN!
[...How you get that whip like that? ]
DAMN!
[...How you stacking chips like that?]
DAMN!
[...How you getting chicks like that?]
...CAUSE I'M SICK LIKE THAT, I GET SHIT LIKE THAT...
DAMN!
I be pushing whips like that...
DAMN!
I be stacking chips like that...
DAMN!
I be getting chicks like that...
...CAUSE I'M SICK LIKE THAT, I GET SHIT LIKE THAT...</pre>
