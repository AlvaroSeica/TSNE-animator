[Chorus: Big Sean and Jhene Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad... I shoulda/coulda seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware... of a woman with a broken heart

[Big Sean]
Prayin to a sky all black
Lookin at the stars like they finna talk back (whoa)
Lookin at my phone like she finna call back (whoa)
But last night I feel like prob'ly ended all that
Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take all back
Sayin "FUCK you!", "I miss you", or "I hate you so much!"
Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know, the highs, the lows 
It comes and goes, you say "be real" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it er'rything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring - funny, right?
And I never cheated... Well I mean, maybe once, twice
But one time don't change er'rything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's sayin

[Chorus]

[Big Sean]
Okay skeet, smoke, sleep, call
Miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa, EWW~!
Time, kill, months, still
I got somebody baby mama callin me daddy (yep)
I drank too much, please call me a cabby (swerve)
Penthouse after party, hoes want that addy (swerve)
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row, that's when you called, I hit cancel
Really I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens!
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screamin 'til my phone died
Then she text me like "Why you still talk to my mama?!
 How the fuck you run around with condoms?!
 Why you made me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo! 
 You the reason I wasn't single in college
 What, all because I had you? Nigga, I dont even have you
 How am I suppose to get past you?"
And she called the next guy spillin some real shit
Now they pro'lems he got to deal with

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Girl... don't believe them hoes
Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly, but baby
Don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
MWAH, I +French+ kiss it like we in Paris
I be screamin out, "Ain't no woman like the one I got"
But she be always worryin about the one I fucked
She said it's gon' be me, myself and I
Damn, that'da make me the one I fuck
PSSH! I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped, PSSH!
But players fuck up, my bad
And, just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Chorus]

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy
Crazy, crazy
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy
Crazy, crazy</pre>
