Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook: Ideal]
Baby come with me, and you will see
How life would be, baby come on come on
Don't you worry baby, I'll keep you main stream
Don't you hesitate, baby come on come on

[E.S.G.]
Come with a hustler ma, I turn two dollars to a mill
Right now you riding, with E.S.G. and Ideal
Last time he told you get on, this year it's come home
Ain't bragging, but take this G-wagon on chrome
Like Diddy, I'm known to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred foot yachts and thangs, I got game
And it's not the same, being married to a G
Christmas Eve I'm on the streets, trying to make ends meet
Keeping Gucci on your feet,and Christian Di'ore
They say your baby daddy weak, I'm trying to give you much more
From the car to the door, the couch to the floor
From a old Ponebill, to a Bentlet Azure
Financially secure, plus your body's the bomb
Heard you lost some funds, invested up and then run
Know some say money, can't buy you love
But it keep the clothes on your back, and a Lac on dubs

[Hook]

[E.S.G.]
I heard your ex upset, he must be out of jail
Is he the one sending my company, them threatening e-mails
What the hell new SL, see my big wheel spin
Take that trash out your deck, and throw this Ideal in
Blue lens blue Coupe, blue shades blue boots
Now CY Adam, was a fool for the fruit
Girl you too cute, so here's a damn invitation
To ball with the Hoggs, while you floss across the nation

[Hook]

[Ideal]
Come on, let me lace ya baby
Come on, let me drive you crazy
I can give you, a better life
Take the chance, baby roll the dice
Come on, what you waiting fo'
Come on, I wanna let you know
I can put you, where you wanna be
Baby just believe, come on roll with me

[E.S.G.]
Couple years done passed, I left the Benz behind
Can't you see I'm on the grind right now, I'm trying to shine
Seven thousand square feet, inside and out
And to help your little son, move you out your mama house
Left all the drama out, let God be my witness
Here take this hundred G's, go start your own bidness
Stay true get the clothes, the best jewels
And make sure my son, stay in the best schools
So I use my tool, to keep you calling my name
On the road doing shows, see I'm thinking bout you mayn
Never knew this thug love, could be the light of your life
See I got you boo, that's why I made you my wife

[Hook]

(Ideal)
Come on, I got you, ooooh
Whoa-ay, come on uh-come on</pre>
