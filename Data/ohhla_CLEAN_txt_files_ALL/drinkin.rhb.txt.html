(1/2 Chorus)
I've gotta drinkin' problem man one mouth and two hands
And an empty can I ain't got no lucci lucci

(Verse 1)
I'm feelin' that funny feelin' again within walkin' me to the kitchen
For that early morning gin drink it in
Till my thoughts they become clear
Dress my naked air and head the fuck up outta here
Fightin' traffic the hot sun be causin' havoc
Ass stuck to the seat window cracked can't see passed it
The liquor store I just passed it lookin' back
I gotta turn around I can't stop thinkin' exactly that
U-turn the past I leave behind
For the ill bumpin' two busted six by nines
And I feel this day to be a good one of plenty
Even if I'm thirsty and my pockets are empty

(Chorus)
I've gotta drinkin' problem man one mouth and two hands
And an empty can I ain't got no lucci lucci
And yall don't understand I'm just a simple man
Doin' the best I can without no lucci

(Verse 2)
Come from a long line of alcoholics
Livin' from toilet to toilet you call it
I'm callin' hotlines swervin' all over yellow lines
Drinkin' moonshine damn was that a stop sign
I ain't doin' good but I'll be fine
Danno where's that cheap wine
Drunk since 9 guzzlin' boone's farm
Trying to stop my shakin' arm
I'm here to stumble the earth and forewarn
7 weeks since I had had shower
I black out like you pulled the plug on Georgia Power
Southern discomfort baby
Seein' pink elephants on down the freeway
The proof on the bottle 180 runnin' out of lucciy
And I won't survive if you don't let me borrow another five
I'm a do it anyway if I'm alive

(Chorus)
I've gotta drinkin' problem man one mouth and two hands
And an empty can I ain't got no lucci lucci
And yall don't understand I'm just a simple man
Doin' the best I can without no lucci

(Verse 3)
Spent my last money on a pabst blue
Ribbon I be gulpin never sippin
Cuz I have to
Booted out the crib and that's cool
Lone as I have brew
Face flush stare at a lush
I might bust you in the gums
I gotta problemo
my life's too up tempo
But yo I'm just simple man
whose mind is crippled man
it all started at a partyand
I was only 15 now I can kill a fifth of Bacardi and
I drink and pass out wake up assed out and start again
I been to AA but hey hey gimme the bottle
12 steppers actin like they never took a swallow

(Chorus til fade)
I've gotta drinkin' problem man one mouth and two hands
And an empty can I ain't got no lucci lucci
And yall don't understand I'm just a simple man
Doin' the best I can without no lucci</pre>
