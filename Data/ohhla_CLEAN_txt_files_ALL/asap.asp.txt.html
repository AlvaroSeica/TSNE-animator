[A$AP Rocky]
I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itchin', fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kiddin', hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocrites and Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Mother-FUCK a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit 'til I'm no longer existin'
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky - singing]
Who said, you cant live forever liiiiied
Of course, Im living forever Illlll, forever, Illlll, live long
Yoooou cant, ever dennnnny, my force
Im living forever Illlll, forever, Illlll (live)

[A$AP Rocky]
Ridin' through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or chokin' on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucka fine
Lost your motherfuckin' mind, what's on your mind? Niggas talkin' down
Never talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talkin' now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back, better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks, so you break her back I'm talkin' 'bout your mom
Cause there's killers in my town, makin' hits, sniffin' lines (yeah)
Out committin' crimes, wait for shit to simmer down (uh)
Corrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine (yeah)
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Uhh, where they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window 
with a pistol to my curtains? {*gun cocks twice; two cha-ching sounds*}

[Chorus]

[A$AP Rocky]
Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch, know we poppin' so she poppin' on this dick
Nigga, R.I.P. to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis and shout out to Triple Six

[Chorus] - unknown female sings along</pre>
