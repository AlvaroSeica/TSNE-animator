Album:  20/20
Song:   You Can't Hide, You Can't Run
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[scratched samples]
"You can't hide, you can't run"
"Remember to, always be true, no matter what you do"
"Run it, I never fronted, I got my whole crew life on it"
"Think sharp"  "Man listen"
"You can't hide, you can't run"
"Remember to, always be true, no matter what you do"
"Run it, I never fronted, I got my whole crew life on it"

[Chorus]
Any day your last day might come (so)
You can't hide, you can't run
Late night or in the shadows when the daylight comes remember
"You can't hide, you can't run"  "Man listen"
Any day your last day might come (so)
You can't hide, you can't run
From the truth, we know each and every day fights come, remember
"You can't hide, you can't run"

[Rakaa Iriscience]
It's like it's "Final Destination," you tryin your best to make it
They say be patient but you know you're cheatin Death, it's chasin
Heart beatin, pulse racin, but I keep the pace and
train to be the best and beat the best by the Gracie
Grappler spectacular rapper sport of altercation
In self-defense we hem 'em up, a tailored alteration
We're firestarters, leavin stages up in flames
Then again we're firefighters, sprayin at whatever's blazin
Crazy ways to express and pass information
Daily makin the best of bad situations
We fight to win in whatever type of test we're facin
Hip-Hop came while they were underestimatin
Amazing grace how sweet the sound, that's what I was raised in
But then the crack and gangs flourished under Ronald Reagan
Life insurance for kids, undertakers waitin
Earth is purgatory, here between the pearly gates and Satan

[Chorus]

[Evidence]
Yeah ("man listen") I stay relevant
Only person I stand in the shadow of is Evidence
Last page, I left off a good look
This ain't the next chapter, it's a whole new book
About to steal the game, I'm a whole new crook
Bakin up that fire, I'm a whole new cook
Get your whole shit took, Cali's back under the sun
So - you can't hide, and you can't run
From the truth, some ain't convinced so they decide to try me
Like I give a fuck, we live from India Arie
They got spies in cameras and trailers
We see 'em settin up though we on counter-surveillance
On to me, I'm on to you, it's no mystery
Better think fast though, the future just your history
It's where the plot thickens, regardless of wealth
Cause the worst person to run from's yourself

[Chorus]
