(Sheeeeeeit! Swag swag...)

[Murs]
Take that cocaine, mix it with the baking soda
On the West Coast, they would say you cookin yola
Hold up, wait... that's a different swag
I'm on some full pound shit, you on that nickel bag (Haaa!)
Dimebag Darrell, rest in peace bro
Shout out to Danny D. coolin on the East Coast
Hardcore hip-hop with some punk in it
Crisscross, bee bop, put some Monk in it

SWAAAAG~! SWAAAAG~! SWAAAAAAAG~!

Swag, swag on Thelonious
Artist one-dimensional will always be the loneliest
Need to change up, need some evolution
And this ain't enough (what?), need some restitution
A black president just ain't enough for me
Fo' hundred years of oppression, that's tough homie
+40 Acres and a Mule+, I need my +Spike Joint+
So if you gonna act a fool then make the right point

SWAAAAG~! SWAAAAG~! SWAAAAAAAG~!

Point, points on your album, bitch! (BITCH!)
They make a million way before you make a thousand, trick
I'm independent, militant, and I'm makin money
I'm like the Panthers, but a Fortune 500 company (Black Power!)
Revolution goin strong since the 70s'
So if you ain't gettin money then you better be
I'd rather be swaggin on my heavy metal shit
Than to be you amd wind up dead in the ghetto, bitch

SWAAAAG~! SWAAAAG~! SWAAAAAAAG~!

Crack cocaine (The ghetto is tryna kill me!)
Rap game so lame (The ghetto is tryna kill me!)
Gentrified genocide (The ghetto is tryna kill me!)
People cold penalized (The ghetto is tryna KILL ME!!)
(..The ghetto is tryna kill me)
Three-strikes systemized (The ghetto is tryna kill me)
Hospital immunized (The ghetto is tryna kill me)
Post-traumatic traumatized (The ghetto is tryna kill me)
(..The ghetto is tryna kill me)
A hobby is homicide (The ghetto is tryna kill me)
Murder's been monetized (The ghetto is tryna kill me)
Well, somebody's gotta die (The ghetto is tryna kill me)
Somebody's gotta die! (SWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG!!!)
Quarter water, grape soda, Motorola, brain tumor
PD, undercover, don't forget the gang unit
All tryna kill me, y'all don't feel me
The ghetto is tryna kill me, the ghetto is tryna KILL ME!! (swag)</pre>
