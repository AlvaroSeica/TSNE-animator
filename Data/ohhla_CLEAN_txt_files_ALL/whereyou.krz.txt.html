Typed by: AZ Lyrics

So ah after this dance maybe we can go back to my place
have some donuts and milk, listen to a pop tune baby

What kind of man would come and stand [?]
What kind of girl would give it to you the way you want it
and make believe you was lovin'

And we grindin' and you look in my eyes and I think that you think what I'm thinkin'
And you touching me softly and taking it off all my money is leavin'

You see I keep trying to leave but ya (got me where you want me)
And I keep on trying to go but ya (got me where you want me)
I don't need no more to drink cause ya (got me like I like me)
I thinkin' you want me cause ya (got me where you want me)

Round two baby
Strip down to your birthday suit
give me that sexy dance
I can give it all to you
give me that sexy chance
And it's turning me on that you're leading me on
and I think it's on now
You movin' too slowly give me what you owe me
all my money is gone now

oooo give me like I like it
oooo give me what I want it
oooo give me like I like it
oooo

You see I keep trying to leave but ya (got me where you want me)
And I keep on trying to go but ya (got me where you want me)
I don't need no more to drink cause ya (got me like I like me)
I thinkin' you want me cause ya (got me where you want me)

[Tech N9ne]
Got me where you want me by the way you work it
Damn [?]

(Got me where you want me)
(Got me where you want me)

[Kutt Calhoun]
uh call me your long lost one night stand
until I'm found and then I ah
commence the beast and unleash
this is so profound ah nah nah
got to show your body, what form
why you should probably aboard
a gigantic Charlie and ?Donkey fuck? you man

You know you naughty plus more the reason to [?]

Let Kutty kutt ya, I'll lace the tuna
its nothing to face the rumors I'm bluffin'
when I'm the brother that's up in the [?]
Ruffin' it up, tuffin it up, any little kinks and I'll be touching it up
got this freak [?]</pre>
