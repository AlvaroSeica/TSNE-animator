[Fila Phil]
Started hittin' hustle when I was just lil'
Then I grab me a mac, I say me first piece of steel-ah
Killin' motherfuckers, god as my witness
A young juvenile, goin' out like a menace
Chillin' on the set, I see a big dope dealer
And my voices in my head sayin' kidnap that nigga
Hands all bloody 'cause I'm hected for dope
But I'ma pull out the gat and let the tec-9 smoke

[Chorus]
Where my hustlers at
Where my hustlers at
I said now where my hustlers at
Where my hustlers at
I said now where my hustlers at
Where my hustlers at
I said now where my hustlers at
Where my hustlers at

[Fila Phil]
Big time hustlers and about all that cappin'
Real, real niggaz all about kidnappin'
Kidnappin' babies, kidnappin' niggaz
Makin' fuckin' money with my finger on the trigga
?????? motherfucker, pockets gettin' swolen
Devil on my shoulders, and I better start rollin'
Picked up the mack, now its time to kill
Put the fuckin' clip into the automatic steel
I ran out my house with the mack oh yes indeed
Red eye, booted up, fawl smokin' that weed
'Cause I'm a big time hustla, big dope dealer
Press Park, Desire, Florida killa
Big time hustla, big dope dealer
Calio, Melphomene, Magnolia killa
Big time hustla, big dope dealer
St. Bernard, St. Thomas, Chris killin' nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, let's steal a U-haul so we can kidnap a nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, let's steal a U-haul so we can kidnap a nigga

[Fila Phil]
Gots to be real, got it goin' on, before I hit a hustle, hit that heroin now
Gots to be real, got it goin' on, before I hit a fuckin' hustle, hit that heroin

[Fila Phil]
Now I'm chillin' in the crack with my mack pulled
6 niggaz on the set up to no good, now I'm lookin' at the nigga, took the mack out
That when I ran by the corner by a bad house
Now they got my fuckin' boy on the corner
And if I spray the tec, best believe my boy's a goner
Yellin' down the street, tryin' to tell my boy to go
Thats when they hit him up with the motherfuckin' calico
Now I'm pissed off feelin' ???????
Went to bussin' at them bitches with the 44 beam
Punk fell down and I thought he was dead
Thats when I hit the hollow points up to his motherfuckin' head

[Fila Phil]
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, It's time to go to war
You shouldn't have killed my fuckin' nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, It's time to go to war
You shouldn't have killed my fuckin' nigga

[Chorus]

[Fila Phil]
Now I'm creepin' in the Melph with my mack out
2 clips taped together 'cause I smoked out
Then I ran around the corner, nigga thought I was chokin'
Hit him with the mack, tore his chest wide open
When he fell down, his boys went a runnin
I had another clip, I put it in and start gunnin'
Dime motherfuckers don't fuck with me
I had him stankin' for days, hangin' up in a tree
I said now dime motherfuckers don't fuck with me
I had him stankin' for days, hangin' up in a tree
So won't ya snort a powder bag, snort a bag of dope
So won't ya snort a powder bag, snort a bag of dope
So won't ya snort a powder a bag, snort a bag of dope
So won't ya snort a powder a bag, snort a bag of dope
And let me kill a, let me kill a, let me kill a nigga
And let me kill a, let me kill a, let me kill a nigga
And let me kill a, let me kill a, let me kill a nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, pass the tec-9 to a Press Park nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, pass the tec-9 to a Slaughter House nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, pass the tec-9 to a Desire nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, pass the street sweeper to a Florida nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, pass the tec-9 to a St. Bernard nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, pass the calico to a Calio nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, pass the 44 to a Melphomene nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, pass the tec-9 to a Magnolia nigga
Rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat trigga, pass the AK to a St. Thomas nigga
Gots to be real, got it goin' on, before I hit a hustle, hit that heroin
Gots to be real, got it goin' on, before I hit a hustle, hit that heroin
