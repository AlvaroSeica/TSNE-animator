Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: 8X]
We jack em up
Then we ridin' high

Jawga Boyz we riding high
We back in the jacked up trucks
Ridin' on 44s mud on the doors
And our plan is to get stuck
On the phone call up the boyz
Let them all know to bring them toys
Got a wench on the front if you need tow
And straight pipes that make some noise
Yeah

We comin' from a mile a way you can hear them roar
Got knobby tires we ridin' higher than we ever did before
If you want a ride then I got to say hop in at your own discrection
Cuz some of have told me that these seats are in the nose bleed section
Got a 12 guage on the black glass and it's ready to go
When I am on the road I never know when I'll see a buck or a doe
Dip in my lip, and a cup of spit in the middle console
Still gettin' hunnies scarin' bunnies you already know
Ha ha
Soulja's truck, gonna keep on rollin' down the road
And it ain't no joke, cuz jawga boyz are as good gold
So take some notes when you hear us flow and see the mud hangin on the door
My truck ain't slow and it ain't for show, cuz!

[Chorus: 8X]
We jack em up
Then we ridin' high

Deep down in the woods
High like the trees
A bunch of rednecks
We don't have no damn degrees
And I'm reppin' for the sticks
I'm reppin' for us hicks
I'm talkin' about us folks who have never seen rich
My chevy truck is jacked up
A mud hole make me act up
Snatch it tight slack up
I'm slingin' mud
Ya'll back up
It's true it ain't no lie
My chevy's high on 45s
Cruzin dui, you know I'm sippin' apple pie
Got that wheelie, rompin loud
Black and camo on my ride
Yeah that georgia flag flys cuz I'm known to show my pride
Yeah we creep and we crawl
Country click yelling yee haw
I've had some slips and falls, due to too much alcohol
Yeah my truck sits tall, sayin I'm scarin at the focus
Grippin mud and climbin rocks still can't find a way to roll it
Now I'm with these jawga boyz and we ridin' tonka toys
With them big trucks big tires, we jack em up and

[Chorus: 8X]
We jack em up
Then we ridin' high

44s, big trucks, camo paint, big bucks
Nuts on my truck hitch, I'm draggin them in the mud rutts
Just some ol country boys, high like the pine trees
And you can bet this be the last of a dying breed
Southern blood, runs through my veins we some rebel boys
Cross the river you ain't heard bottleneck and them jawga boyz
Comin' through on the tonka toys riding high and jacked up
Slangin mud like the hubs we got that mack cuz
Raw dog in the Georgia Clay jacked up is how we play
This is how we do it buck we keep em southern raised
Stuck in our southern ways, stayin in the desperate days
We riding high and jack em up they ain't no other way
Better grip that steerin' wheel gonna make that chevy squeel
True gritty country boys hick life you know it real
We on that southern grind, we jacked up all the time
We ridin in the sky

[Chorus: 8X]
We jack em up
Then we ridin' high

Yeah we riding high!</pre>
