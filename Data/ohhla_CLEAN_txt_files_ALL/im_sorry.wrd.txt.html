[Werd]
Sorry for the past rhyme
Last time I was out my mind
I'm so sorry for the last time 
Swear its the last time
Sorry for the last time last time I was out my mind

[Sample]
Iv been so many places in my life and time
Iv sung allot of songs 
Made some bad rhymes

[Werd]
Listen sorry for the last time 
Last time I was out of line with the last line
Thinking you would act kind
Thinking its a past-time I drink just to pass time
Thinking that I'm slipping got clinching to a past rhyme
And since lady luck left
All the pages I got left aint nothing but second best
Second guessed stressed through days until the next
Threw away bad rhymes see at times I must confess
I'm a mess (yes) I keep calling SOS
But dont hear me when I'm shouting then I'm doubting what I said
And the smoke is in my chest smell the flavor in my breath
Trying to savored my behavior cause it changes with the next
How I can be myself I dont know who I am
I spent my whole life looking and rap understands
Dont do it for sales I do it for self
And I'm unique mate just like everybody else
I'm sorry

You ken that I'm sorry
For what I said what I done
For what I didnt and what I'm still going to get done [x2]

I'm sorry for the past rhymes 
Last time a'l tell you this as we pass pints 
Drinking with the hash mind
Thinking its a past-time drinking just to pass time
Thinking that I'm quitting this is different this is past rhymes
And its crazy see maybe cunts check
But the pages on the net aint nothing but second best 
To pressed so I'm getting depressed
These are hard times why I get out my bed
I'm upset and the sets SOS
You see me when I'm bouncing up this mountain that is stress
Position like its chess contradicting what I said
Keep on fighting keep on writing or a'l tighten up my neck
How I can keep living you just dont understand
They dont want to hear you rap better be in a band
Or be a banned left on the shelf
And I'm unique mate just like everyone else
I'm sorry
