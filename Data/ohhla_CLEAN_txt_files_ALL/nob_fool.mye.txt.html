[Kam Moye]
I speak soft but I carry a big stick
For me to be soft ain't a characteristic
You adamant with thinking it then that'll get dismissed
Cause then it's evident to me you haven't been listening
like Nixon in tele biz, nowadays sell in fear
You afraid of me cause I tell it like the hell it is
The way they sell them here, I don't wanna sell to live
I got relatives doing Mandela years
So all that back and forth bickering I ignore
I've never seen a record deal that's worth dying for
Proud to get you trapped like deer under a lion's paw
They say "Homie right there, he ain't lying boy"
This is like Job Corps training you with skills
If I can pay my bills, fuck I wanna be a star for man?
Before I used to be a sneaker head hardcore
Till I seen children barely eating out in Darfur
Now that's far more important than the latest trends
I feel like rap music as a whole
has depreciated like a nineteen-eighty Mercedes Benz
They'd rather see you wasting lives than saving 'em
Disenfranchize and disable 'em
Label 'em a conspiracy theorist and a crazy one
I'm way beyond, thinking sheep-like
Strategize more like a chess master to street fight
I see the light

[Chorus: Tenille]
I am nobody's fool
Wasn't born yesterday
I'm searching for the truth
Until I pass away
I am nobody's fool
Wasn't born yesterday
You do what works for you
I'll live my life my way

[Kam Moye]
Yo, I don't ride to celebrity gossip or the media hoopla
Is Paris Hilton possibly the key to my future?
The news hardly speak on brothers until we do wrong
Then they got it covered like the leader of the Ku Klux
I can't bring myself to watch the six o'clock news
They barely air it when a minority drop jewels
But damn right, they gon' air the same nappy headed nigga missing teeth
standing on the block without shoes
Ironic ain't it, damn near demonic isn't it
The way they make us out to be porch monkeys and prisoners
Arabs and asians and latinos too
Take these words home and think it through, here's what they think of you
All lying magazines and newspaper articles
I read between the lines cause I ain't nobody's fool
I tell my own fam you've gotta be involved
That's if you want justice and equality for all
I saw the world stand up and protest for Jena Six
But sit around like neighborhood deaths are meaningless
Many deaths happening but some of us were never shown
Cause we didn't Jesse Jackson with a megaphone
Or a sweaty Al Sharpton with his hair straight
Don't become a modern day slave to the airwaves
Think outside of the box, don't become a marionette
Cause that's what compose a real threat
And it's real like that

[Chorus]

[Kam Moye] - {repeat 2X}
Stay awake to the ways of the world
Stay awake to the ways of the world
Open up your eyes
Stay awake to the ways of the world
Stay awake to the ways of the world
Watch for the lies</pre>
