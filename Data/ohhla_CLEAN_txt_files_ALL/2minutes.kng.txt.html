I'm the foremost rap master, yes, I do cast a spell
(On the ladies) but I don't kiss and tell
And if you don't know me well that's your loss
I'm Sugar Kay, servin a three course
Meal, so get ready to chow down
Yo Mike Master, huh, how that sound?
(Ah yeah, like a winner)
But guess who's coming to dinner?
All MC's and DJ's too
Singin the blues cause they can't get jazzy
Or grab the mic and swing the funk dope as we
I'm Sugar Kay and this is the Kings of Swing
And wherever we go, yo, we gots to bring
The funky dope rhythm that'll hit
So all competition, I suggest ya don't quit
Your day job, yo, we gave a fair warning
We goin on to the break of dawn, see you in the morning

[ Mike Master ]
Clap your hand as I command the dance
In the family you know I wear the pants
In a cast of thousands I get the leading role
Cause I'm deadly, black and bold
Mike Master, the ghetto blaster
Don't go against the King cause you know you won't last a
Minute and a half
I get in it and laugh
And when win it (say what?) you be left in bloodbath
Here's the jigsaw, pick up the pieces
I won't stop until the beat ceases
To exist 
(But yo hold up this beat is groovin kinda funky)
True, so yo, bust this
I'm the Mike Master, down with the Kings Of Swing
And wherever we go, yo, we gots to bring
A funky dope rhythm that'll hit
Step on prides and make MC's admit
The truth, hard to face, but it'll set you free
Kay, what you think about that? (Sounds funky)
