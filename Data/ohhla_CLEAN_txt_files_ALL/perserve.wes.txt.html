CHORUS [Wade O. Brown]
Hate put me in here
But love is gonna get me out
I'm never going under, I know for sure
Hate put me in here
But love is gonna get me out
I'm never going under, I know for sure

[Maestro]
Yo
It's like you're mentally incarcerated, fighting for life
Crying for freedom in a cold cell
No one can hear you, but they'd never fear you 
in the sixteenth round, never surrender
Using righteous wisdom, black man we'll fight the system
It's survival of the fittest, the sky be the limit
Show the youths them
And let them know they'll shine in a minute
It's their chance to rule
So let them know they be descendants of greatenss, kings and queens
We're overcoming
Hate got us here, love will get us out (get us out)
With knowledge of self we'll turn it out
I see my foes approaching, but vocally I'm overdosin', 
I leave 'em comatosin', my thoughts evoke emotion
All my ancestors ride with me, I know they died for me
And I can here it when they cry with me
Knowledge, wisdom, over-standing made me open my eyes
Perserverance gonna keep me alive

CHORUS

[Maestro]
I got the spirit of a hurricane
To overthrow your Babylon
My mind is of a prophet
My soul ain't got no shackles on
I'm living in iniquity, created by your ministry
Still I'm elevating, trying to reach my peeps
I'll teach a shorty 'bout survival
Forget the bottle, it's genocidal
The system's out to stop your props
And tranquilize you, crucify your body and your mental
Leavin' you in sorrow while you search for tomorrow
Got you hoping to win, while my melodious swing
Got me sitting like an ancient Ethiopian King
I thank God for breathing, I know I'm here for a reason
I'm trying to save a life
And stop my people from bleeding
While my ancestors ride with me, I know they died for me
And I can here it when they cry with me
Knowledge, wisdom, over-standing made me open my eyes
Perserverance gonna keep me alive

CHORUS

[Wade O. Brown]
Take my hand and fly with me
I wanna know can you see the sky with me
Can you close your eyes and strive with me
I need to know
Take my hand and fly with me
I wanna know can you see the sky with me
If you close your eyes I know you'll see
I know for sure

[Maestro] (Wade O. Brown)
Yo
Now it's time for me to live again
And time for me to breathe again
Transcend and make a difference
And go the distance
Me and you were supposed to meet
It's written in the stars and in the scriptures
Don't get it twisted, just get uplifted
It's supposed to happen
Now we're achieving the impossible
Hurdling over obstacles and takin' it nice
We went the whole scrimmage
We went for no-limits
Overcoming, realizing God's in our own image
I know my ancestors ride with me
I know they died for me
And I can hear it when they cry with me
Knowledge, wisdom, over-standing made me open my eyes
Perserverance gonna keep me alive
(Say it again)
I know my ancestors ride with me
I know they died for me
And I can hear it when they cry with me
Knowledge, wisdom, over-standing made me open my eyes
Perserverance gonna keep me alive

CHORUS

[Wade O. Brown]
Take my hand and fly with me
I wanna know can you see the sky with me
Can you close your eyes and strive with me
I need to know
Take my hand and fly with me
I wanna know can you see the sky with me
If you close your eyes I know you'll see
I know for sure
