[Lil Uno]
Mommy Hello
Make It Wiggle Like Jello
And Like Juel's Steam, Make Me Whistle Like A Kettle
Drop It, Shake It, Do It Lil Mama
Have A Party In My Lap, And She's Shaking Topless
I Spit Like Ty Cause My Flows Is The Cleanest
And They Call Me Mean D Cause My Flow Is Mean
And I'm Movin Real Fast Like I'm Drivin A Nas Car
Hips Lookin Right Plus her Ass Real Large
Bring The Beat Back Cause Is Slap Like 15's
Put My Number In Her Phone Now She Tell Me She Miss Me
Freaked Her At A Party It Was Hard To Tame
Cause she Kept Comin Back Like A Boomer Rang
Then I Whispered In Her Ear And Sed sumn Like This
(Back It Up Lil Mama Yea Do That Shit)
Goin Stupid In Da Party But We All Call It Da Hyphy Sippin Drinks, Shakin Dreads, Dont Care If U Like It

[Chorus]
