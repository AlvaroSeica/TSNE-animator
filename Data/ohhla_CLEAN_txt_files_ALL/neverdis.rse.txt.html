[Intro]
We'll never disappear
Rise. Yo, I want to take this time out, to just recognize a few people
That have effected our lives. In one way or the other
Directly or indirectly. No longer with us. They actually still are

Disappear
"We will be here forever"- KRS-One
So, hold up. Here's my list...

[Verse One]
My mother first, Marie
Julia, Joe, Birda, Lexus
Grandfathers, grandmothers
Both sides of the family plant
June, Gary, yeah, back years, poor Sean
A sibling that I never had that almost got born
Lunina
Peace to Alf from Westbury 
Sharmaine, Junie's pops
Kyle, my shiesty cousin Garnin
Liz's grandfather 
Edna, grandmother mom's side
Aunt Primo's step-grandfather just died
Left us at the wrong time
Heaven is always draftin' teams
Do you stand next to us or watch us on a flattened screen? 
Is that really y'all that we're chattin' with when we're havin' dreams?
Or just imagination, the human mind practicing?
Always in our minds man
You come up in our conversations
Saved from the rat race and restin' in your final places
Body wasn't showed, just a case with your face inside
Though you still with us, it'd be great to see your face one time

Chorus: [x5]
"We will be here forever"- KRS-One
We'll never disappear
And they sung to me

[Verse Two]
And Scott La Rock, Ill Will, Jam Master Jay
B.I.G., Pac, Pun
Big L
Poetic from Gravdiggs
Tah Freaky, E Eazy, O.D.B., Left Eye
Aaliyah, Proof, rip Ronnie, Eminem's guy
Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Marvin Gaye, Rick James
Selva Cruz, Luther Vandross, Kurt Cobain
Barry White, Ray Charles, John Lennon, Jay Dee
Trouble T-Roy, Fat Boys, Buffy MC
Cowboy from Furious Five and Jimi Hendrix
Curtis Mayfield, Selena and Sammy Davis
Nat King Cole, DJ Screw, cut on and on and
The good die young so God can throw on the bombest concerts
And for Heaven's sake
Your life and lesson's left
And we still hear your voice
Is like you rushed to death
You influenced our shape
And how we livin' here
Until there's no one left
You'll never disappear

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
We wonder if you're up down, right here or born again
Relive the days that you left and feel torn in ten
Death is a part of life
Shit, not the part you like
Raise to give it all to God, pray
Eat a part of Christ
They never left us, hey
They're in a better place
Not layin' in that wooden case, in a bed of lace
Dark suitor dressed, lookin' bored
There's no spirit here
Might have flipped my gourd 
But I swore I could hear her clear
Givin' me advice
Cause doubts, I don't listen well
The reason I'm breathin' 
I was grievin' at a measly twelve
Nor did I have a reason
Young, with a lesser patience
Like I could understand it
Pray for the explanation
Brother from another mother
Caught up with a bullet later
Written in his plan but he won't show me the piece of paper
Recycled energy, the story of time
And death is our rival to our glory divine

Disappear
"That's what I'm saying"- KRS-One</pre>
