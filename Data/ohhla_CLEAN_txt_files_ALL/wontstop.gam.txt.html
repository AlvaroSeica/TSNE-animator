[Chorus: Danielle Haim]
We arrrrre, so farrrrr, away from herrrrre

[Childish Gambino]
Tell them "Run it back, this song is my shit"
Told that DJ, "Turn it up," all we did was Bowflex
It's that Stone Mountain, DeKalb County, fuck boys know shit 'bout me
Still real, no shit, cash gun, money clip
285 to 400 then I made a left
Man we spend it up in Lenox, boy we fresh to death
They be sleepin when I left, now they heard of me
We get paid to keep y'all hyped, that's that turnip green
New kicks, street ball, black top, asphalt
Tight dress, her ass fault, get face like bath salts
Airport atheist, only pray when there's turbulence
So why the fuck am I stressin over this nervous shit?

[Chorus] - 2X

[Childish Gambino - singing]
Burn, burn, burn
My new car, my new clothes
Now that I'm on top, are ya, proud of me?
Proud of me?
Burn, burn, burn
My new car, my new clothes
Now that I won't stop, are ya, proud of me?
Proud of me?
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I'm on top, are ya, proud of me?
Proud of me?
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I'm on top, are ya, proud of me?
Proud of me?

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
Are you proud of me?
Are you proud of me?
Na na na na, na na na na, no, no no
Na na na, should've known, should've known
