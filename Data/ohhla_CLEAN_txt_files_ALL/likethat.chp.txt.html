Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that (Yeah)
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that (Yeah yeah)

They say money rule the world, Well I'm a hundred dollar bill
An I'm just look-in for a subtle spot ta chill
Niggaz crazy, Thinkin bout today an not tomorrow
Hope they never have to borrow out here frontin like they
(Made it like that)
But I don't stress 'em I just keep pressin along
If I ain't got no rellos then case got the bong
An, Let me take one to the face then I'm gone
I got these Louie's on my face for the sun cause I
(Made it like that)
Everything I got I took it look at what we did
Passin out tapes at school ta out a town paid gigs
Even older bitches want the kid like I'm Taye Diggs
Givin' ho's they groove back all I here is Hayyyy Chip
Hay bitches how ya doin
And they flock to 'em cause they know he won't pursue it
Just do it if you want it an don't stop until you there
Damn Chip you poppin' everywhere, That's cause I

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that (Yup)

Coming to you live from the jungle full of pride
And drugs, Many lives taken from under these lights
Where them Nike air flights been roamin out plenty nights
It was a whole lotta shots n not to many fights
We was young keepin up with then niggaz who was hatin
Nobody gave us nathin we we just had to take it
Now, Lil Stakes just got 38, better smarten up
Lil John goin off, Yeah we got some problems bru
Pray an ask the lord ta stay, Give me just another day
An if I die before I wake tell my niggaz split my cake
Yeah just like 50 say cause I can't take it anyway
We livin in a different day and yesterday ain't shit today
So what I gotta git today is paper in a different way
Condo fuck a crib cause hey ya window just a brick away
Followed by you fill in the blank wile I just slide on by
Up in 216 bout to catch a flight to 909

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that</pre>
