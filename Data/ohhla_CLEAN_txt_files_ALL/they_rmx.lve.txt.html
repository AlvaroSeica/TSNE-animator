Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Ludacris]
They don't know way call you sprinkling
system cuz you sprinkle it like water
Don't tell your daddy you've be calling me daddy
But tell him Lundacris is thankful for his daughter
While we all in the backseat of my Impala
Hut one hut two, hike, hike, hike
They don't know about the scratches on my back
And how I call you my bed bug when you bite, bite, bite, bite
Nibbling and dribbling, feeling all of my adrenaline
Tasting like cinnamon, I can think of so many synonyms
You be killin them other women, be pretending they
That they don't know that you really hardcore
Like Lil' Kim and them
Squat down, bend it over, bring it back
From the side, turn around
Hunch back, Notre Dame
Turn your device on, it's the right song
Turn the lights on, Rico Love and you know my name

[Rico Love]
They don't know, a loud mouth won't get you nowhere
Baby I swear (they don't know)
I'm best friends with Giuseppe
If you let me I'll put you in something rare
Yeah, I fuck with your home girl back in 06'
Why she keep bringing up old shit
She was cool with a girl I use to go with
But you can tell em both that it's yo dick
I bet (they don't know)
That you don't even speak when you see me in the streets
But you still my little freak, girl
You don't take pictures of your [?]
(they don't know)
Tonight we might be court side
Me you and wifey
To hundred on my neck, even though I gotta check
She'll fuck around and spend it on me

[Chorus]
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
(Bet you ain't know that)
They don't, they don't know
(She got her own paper)
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
(A broke bitch would never understand that)
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
We be in the same room, but we don't ever say shit
Let's keep it between me and you
And we cool cuz they don't know

[Trey Songz]
How you feel about me, can't live without me
Without me (they don't know)
Have that pretty thing cream when you think bout me (bout me)
(They don't know)
You've been staying in my condo bout a month
It's a key up on your chain, when you go through some things
Escape whenever you want
They don't know
How I hit it by the fire and your legs stretch wider
And it's just get tighter
They don't know
That you're stressed and you're tired
But the stress gets lighter with the money that I wire
I like to put my lips on, kiss on every part of your body
Do it so well, baby who you gonna tell? Nobody

[Tiara Thomas]
Give a nigga face a hi-5, I don't know why she was looking at me side eye
I don't even know why I'm sky high
I don't even know why I'm high, instead of high crime
But I gotta gang of naked pictures that I'm ready to send you
But if you just want relations
Baby there's nothing I can't do
You said you looking for something to get into
Well I'm looking for someone to get into
They don't don't know you got me crazy
Craving and screaming that I wanna have your baby
Post it all up in this bed, all up in my legs
Pull in like thigh Mercedes
They don't know, they can't hang if they don't smoke
I don't fuck with niggas if they don't blow
And that ain't no joke

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
They be all in your ear
While you stick around while you're here
All he do is let you down, does he care?
How your smile disappear
How many times you cried in a year
Is it love, or the pride and the fear
Did you try to interior
How she gonna dive off a pier with some concrete shoes on their heel
(I'll arrange that)
Don't they know they talking loud,
Blowing smoke when it's clear
I'll be standing right here
(Turn the lights on)
Ever since we met, you done had the best
Wait a little longer it got better than that
Ok, I gave everything that I had in my check
Never held back, was you telling em that?
Man, I'm the answer to the question, where them felonies at?
Don't have me waiting for the cat
Like where the hell is he at
Aye the love of my life, you gone forever be that
Whoever questioning that
I guess it's clear to see that
(They don't know)

[Chorus]</pre>
