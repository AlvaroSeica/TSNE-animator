[Intro]
Another piece that I wrote, about me
Being stuck in my ways, yeah

[Krizz Kaliko]
I can't give up what I'm in love with
I guess I'm a mess and I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am
What it I do to be so wrong?
Could I be so different?
Is there a remedy?
WIll you be forgivin me?
Cause this aint, my life, or the way it was sposed to be
Waiting here for you to come and tell me
What I do so wrong?

[Tech N9ne]
Listen to me, this talent was given to me
By his omnipotence so dig it music is livin through me
Even through prisons I've arissen he big and is in movies
ism if is is a hit, the vision is in beauty for women
When I'm writin I'm winnin, so excitin I'm grinnin
Then you strike an now the fights are beginnin
I gotta be sharp as a knife when I'm on the mic an you sinnin
By stiflin my spinnin with an imaginary life as you been in
By thinkin you be the reason, no speakin to you this evenin
I'm deep in this music reachin for the peice I dilute the season
But you be illin cause my attention you truly stealin
Pursue the millions, come in second-would you be willin?
Don't think so, you be thinkin time an I think dough
Love is what you need from me but in time it'll shrink mo
Cause I be on the grind for this rhyme an the ink flow
I go for mine an you think its a crime an I think "WHOA"

[Krizz Kaliko]
An I can't give up what I'm in love with
But I guess I'm a mess an I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am
An I can't give up what I'm in love with
But I guess I'm a mess an I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am

[Tech N9ne]
Everything in my closet is black, white an red
Most of my homies was bosses but got life or dead
Now I move in they shadows but I got the mic an bread
But this life it seem ya destiny is a knife or lead
Yes I was brought up in a Cristian house
But my mother marreing a Muslim threw the christian out
An what they did to Malcom X threw the islam out
So my homies with money seemed to be the glistnen route
What I found was funerals and I found it was real friends
But I paid attention and then I found that it was real men
Takin care of their familys automatically built in
Riskin they life in the street as long as the wheel spin
SO, what I gathered from it is simply my perogotive
I only wish the organization was more positive
I maintain, and continue to gain thangs
I bust an I claim Strange but I'm reppin that gang bang

[Krizz Kaliko]
An I can't give up what I'm in love with
But I guess I'm a mess an I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am
An I can't give up what I'm in love with
But I guess I'm a mess an I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am

An I can't give up what I'm in love with
But I guess I'm a mess an I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am
An I can't give up what I'm in love with
But I guess I'm a mess an I just can't shake it
I just can't change what I am</pre>
