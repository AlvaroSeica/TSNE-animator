[D-Sisive]
Press record, oy oy, you sing in harmony
I'd rather Harmony Corinne
Lamar Benoit, oy oy, headphones on
Heads blown off {*KEN PARK*}
Heartbreak anthems, funeral ballads
Brass bands following you in a casket
Roses tossed, soaking tissues
Voices whisper I miss you
Voices whisper I heard he was in too deep
Couldn't wake up out of his Hindu sleep
Buried in his prom suit, he was so young
Kept lines hidden, read read between the
picket signs lifted, we would have seen him
But not a word written on a single piece of
board, silence, D-Sisive's rhyming a-gain
While aiming a nine at my brain

[Chorus]

[D-Sisive]
Press record, oy oy, you live in harmony
I'd rather Harmony Corinne
Lamar Benoit, oy oy, headphones on
Heads blown off {*KEN PARK*}
I sing to the sky, serenade stars
Spit sick 'til they carry then bury my corpse
Again, the reincarnation of Jim
Grin in the faces of sin, grim
Pray for the songs that I pen
Pray for the generation my pain in-fluen-ces
Anybody out there listening
I miss you but I don't want to miss a thing
I wish I could kill what I think I am
but I live for the flowers and whispering
So silence, D-Sisive's rhyming a-gain
While aiming a nine at my brain

[Chorus]

[Outro: Boyz II Men]
It's so hard, to say goodbye, to yesterdayyyyyyy</pre>
