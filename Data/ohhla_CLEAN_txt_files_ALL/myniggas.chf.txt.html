[Chorus]
I be smoking on a lot of killa
Uh oh, out here with his killas
So please don't disrespect my niggas
Cause we gon kill a lot of fucking niggas
Don't disrespect, my niggas [x8]

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I be smoking on a lot of killa
Uh oh, out here with these killas
We ape shit, bitch we go gorillas
Smoking loud, bitch I call it thriller
Bitch I got a lot of fucking thots
OTF we got a lot of fucking blocks
Sosa came from bottom to the top
Made man, so please don't get shot
Please don't disrespect my niggas
Shoot the bullets out this LA clipper
[?]
Pill poppin, fuck around and shoot a nigga

[Chorus]
I be smoking on a lot of killa
Uh oh, out here with his killas
So please don't disrespect my niggas
Cause we gon kill a lot of fucking niggas
Dont disrespect, my niggas [x8]

[Verse 2: SD]
Dont trip I got a lot of niggas

[Chorus]
I be smoking on a lot of killa
Uh oh, out here with his killas
So please don't disrespect my niggas
Cause we gon kill a lot of fucking niggas
Don't disrespect, my niggas [x8]</pre>
