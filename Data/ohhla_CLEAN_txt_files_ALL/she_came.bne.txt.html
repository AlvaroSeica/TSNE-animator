[Intro: Thin C.]
Yeah, it's the infamous
Internationally known, Mo Thugs
Uhh, and this party right here
Yeah, is for the sexy and the thuggish
Yeah, it's for the sexy and the thuggish
A-c'mon
 
[Thin C.]
Walls with Picasso, yeah we got those
Fuck with real models, that's my motto
Things that protect us from the lames that follow
Special gray tips, yeah nigga they hollows
'Specially made whips, yeah mami plus silo
My philosophy like, Aristotle
Go right on ma, and empty the bottle
Pimp juice is up, so I'm comin full throttle
Soon as you say so I'm on you like Play-Doh
Don't be scared of the couple next to us
It's like the Playboy mansion, let's do us!
You playin fast flow, I see us in that, girl
I wanna toss it then flip to the back, girl
Now you're sayin freaky shit, who your daddy girl?
You poppin hips with Thin C., it's another world
On your way to really party is with Thugs girl
 
[Chorus: Thin C.]
She came here to party
She came here to hang
She came here with Bacardi
The headliners change just to give us some brain
She came here to meet somebody
She came here to make some change
T-shirts and panty parties
These girls gon' do they thang
 
[D.J. Dre Ghost]
Now watch me get buck, crazy as fuck
Wild when I throw down; come test me now
Hey girls, move your sexy bo-dy
For the D-R-E G-H-O-S-T
Big body girls is what I wan' G
When I'm chillin up in the club with my nigga Thin C.
Or get the fuck out of here!
See it's a t-shirt and panty party, fuck the bub' or Bacardi
And I hardly ever do this
Then sip a silo is what is you need to do Miss
And it ain't no bullshit
Cause Little Lay' told me you are freaky than a muh'fucker
You use a clip as a crack you got wide open
The mother of pearls is what you got girl
And I'ma take a look sit back and watch your toes curl
You gon' rub up in the club for Mo Thugs like us  WHAT!
 
[Chorus]
 
[Layzie Bone]
Now baby usually I'm on a song talkin 'bout blastin and mobbin
But I see so many flavors it's like Baskin &amp; Robbins
Thin got me in my playa mode, let me show you how a playa roll
You know I know the way to go, if you ain't know Little Lay's a pro
You was lookin for a baller, well you found him
I was lookin for a thick ass pretty to be around me
And I know you know the drill, gon' take them panties off
And I know you want it baby, come and break a nigga off
No need in stallin mami, yeah I got protection
I'm a thug ass nigga, with a nine inch erection
Tryna get up in your middle-section, work it 'til your water fall
Somethin like Niagara, natural Viagra
With so much stamina I'm bound to blow your back out
You came for the same thang, don't even try to act out
Let's leave the club so we can satify our horny bones
And don't you worry 'bout a thang cause my money long
 
[Chorus]  repeat till fade</pre>
