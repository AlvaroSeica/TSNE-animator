[Intro: Chamillionaire]
Mmm-hmmm, alright
Chamillitary mayne
Mmm-hmmm, alright
Uh, the money's calling me
Everybody knows how I feel about my bank (uh)
Some say I'm heartless but y'all know I ain't (uh)
Won't have no problems as long as you're keepin it G
Just keep it G - the money's calling me

[Chamillionaire]
Yeah I could've went Hollywood but I stayed trill and remained true
Still ridin them big blades that I slide on when I skate through
Ever told me you hate haters? Well guess what, that makes two
Cause nowadays he got paid, this cold world boy I hate you
But yo' girl want me to serve pipe, I got pa'tners on they third strike
And they goin for they fourth, it's like they know they wanna serve life
I got pa'tners that sell Herbalife and got pa'tners that sell herb for life
No longer beefin with Mike Jones, but I still murder mics

[Interlude: Chamillionaire - screwed]
In the city where you from, you made it out the slum
Now they actin like you owe 'em and you gotta give 'em some
Park your Caddy in the sun, they didn't help you get it
But there'll always be some people gettin mad about your digits
Got these boys that never did it, disrespectin what you've done
Got some ladies catchin feelings, tryin to be your number one
Got the world on your back, I know the pressure weigh a ton
But we keep on grindin on 'em, tell the money here I come

[Chorus One: Chamillionaire]
I be like - let's go get it (go) let's go get it (alright)
Pull the droppa out, then I start it up, no actin timid
I'm like - let's go get it (go) let's go get it (alright)
First I drop the top, then turn up the knock so they can feel it
I'm like - let's go get it (go) let's go get it (alright)
Lookin at my watch, time is money, so I'm countin minutes
Got the world on your back, I know the pressure weigh a ton
But we keep on grindin on 'em, tell the money here I come

[Chamillionaire]
Can't sidetrack these lyin cats tryin to make me take a straight loss
He say he got them birdies, told him I don't even play golf
Completely different sport, they got me ballin, practice paid off
Step back and hit that switch it's like there's no blockin my J dawg (WOO!)
I got diamonds in my ring, chain, celly goin "rang rang"
Look down inside my dough, make sure I got my Kirko Bang Bang
And I ain't talkin 'bout car bass, see how fast yo' heart race
And I'll keep it +Geto Boy+ but please don't end up with a +Scarface+
I twist in that lil' key and then start my car up
Before noon I'll flip mo' then registers at Starbucks
Don't talk much, I talk math, and don't subtract, let's add
Gold Roley and no dough be your accessories then I'll laugh
Go count once and then check twice, just get it right, don't guess though
I hope the money ain't short dawg cause I'll never settle for less hoe
A big salute to my congregation, we get +Dollars+, no Creflo
Two money pockets with money in them is always part of my dress code

[Interlude]

[Chorus Two: Chamillionaire]
I be like - let's go get it (go) let's go get it (alright)
Let's go get it (go) let's go get it (alright)
Let's go get it (go) let's go get it (alright)
Lookin at my watch, time is money, so I'm countin minutes
Got the world on your back, I know the pressure weigh a ton
But we keep on grindin on 'em, tell the money here I come

[Chamillionaire]
They ain't hustlin the same as me, alright
Mmm, the money's calling me
We ain't worried 'bout a thing cause we, alright
Grind so hard they can't believe
They ain't really who they claim to be, alright
All this money's never changin me
Loyalty is everything to me, alright
And that's why, I'm stayin sucker-free

[Interlude]

[Chorus Two]

[Outro: Chamillionaire]
They ain't hustlin the same as me, alright
Mmm, the money's calling me
