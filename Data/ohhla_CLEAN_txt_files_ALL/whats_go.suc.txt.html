[Chorus - 2x]
Tell me, what is going on
Tell me, what am I doing wrong
Why people don't get along
I don't know, I don't know

[H.A.W.K.]
It was written, place where the apple was bitten
In the forbidden, where Eve made a bad decision
We're all in prison, victims of a bad decision
Different religions, and also there's race division
It's Spanish Blacks Caucasians, Indians Asians
Saudi Arabians, and also the Creole and Cajun
Churches are blazing, authorities done gauging hazing
Young children aging, the world is raging
War is raging, politicians lying and faking
And I still don't know, why Pat's life was taken
The world's a slave and, he's the one who started the hating
But God is waiting, read the book of revelations
Trials and tribulations, will come to an end
And there will be more then, just a few good men
And now I comprehend, so my knees I bend
In the name of Jesus Christ I pray, amen

[Chorus - 2x]

[Mr. 3-2]
Now tell it what it's like, if you ain't got bread
Holes in your pocket, man I'd rather be dead
Instead I get ahead, keep my head above water
Doing what I gotta, for my son and daughter
Tell me what I'm doing wrong, to get it right
I don't know what's going on, but I'ma put up a fight
It was already written, how this world was flipped
So I might as well do my time, and stick to the script
Never forget, who come first G-O-D
The one who made me, set all my people free
Why don't we get along, with our very own people
Demons inside, that inspire a life of evil
The hatred the love, is a real thin line
Struggling to get mine, every nickel and dime
I'm gon' shine, just like the sun that raise
Coming up with many ways, to make more brighter days

[Chorus - 2x]

[Chris Ward]
Cause where I'm from, brothers slang packs of crack
Multiplying stacks, just to keep they life on track
See it's a fact, on top of that a known statistic
That I should be dead and buried, by the time 26 hit
Or at least convicted, of some type of felony
It's not only the truth, it's what society's telling me
So as I look around, I try to picture what's going on
I realize and recognize, a whole lot is going wrong
Everybody's chasing after those, waterfalls
And when they get there they find out, that's where the water falls
This world, ain't righteous for all
The people that laugh wit ya they laugh at ya, right when you fall
I spend my life my life, trying to make the best of it
Hold on be strong until I'm gone, not make a mess of it
I'm a grown ass man now, nothing less of it
Sometimes I strain my brain, so I smoke to relieve the stress of it

[Chorus - 4x]</pre>
