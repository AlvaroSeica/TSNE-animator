(Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko &amp; Tech N9ne)
Try to move right through it's like we'll never (it's like i'll never make it)
Make it better (Gimme pills let me take it)
I can't change the weather (yeah)
And I'm goin' back to where i've been
Hope somebody lets me it
I need shelter from myself
If you could hear me please send help
 
(Hook: Krizz Kaliko)
It keeps on rainin' in my mind
Another storm another day
These pills will change my mind
Cause they don't make it go away
It keeps on rainin' in my head
Another storm another day
These little pills will change my mind 
Cause they don't make it go away
It keeps on raining
 
(Bridge: Krizz Kalikko)
It's over, It's over, It's over, I'm Sober
It's over, It's over, I'm Sober, I'm Sober
It's over, I'm Sober, I'm Sober, I'm Sober
I'm Sober, I'm Sober, I'm Sober, It's over
 
(Verse 2: Krizz Kaiko &amp; Tech N9ne)
Can only see myself is anybody here (I ain't even myself no more)
If you could be myself you'd understand me clear (Help pick myself up off the floor)
And if I die today it would take my pain away
Cause it's flooding (Flooding)
And I'm drowing (Drowning)
But it just liberating me
 
(Hook)
 
(Bridge)
 
(Verse 3: Tech N9ne)
Let's find a way to run away from full of pain and strife
What direction am I going I can't tell now
Mister 7-20 Nina tells me I'm hell bound
The IRS is on my ass for the check that I didn't cash
And the levy from child support felt like I fell down
So I'm looking for Ectsasy pills
Tech is the next to be thrills 
Seconds from method we ill daily 
My brains cooking the recipe will
Beckon the best of me kills
Sections of stepin' and i feel crazy
Hit the club in the night
With a little bit of drug in my life
And wish I lovin' it real height
Me I'm deliverin'
With my seeds out my sight
Seperated from my wife
In the middle of a crisis I'm hype
Shaking and shivering
Rolling balls I'm elated and going down numb now
Drinkin' liquor I'm faded and having fun now
Loaded gun and I'm trippin' with everyone around
Keep me stuck in the sky I never wanna come down
