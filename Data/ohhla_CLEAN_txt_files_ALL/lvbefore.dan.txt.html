Typed by: @Daneo10

CHORUS: 
Oooh, if you've never been in love before
Then you really don't know what pain is, what pain is
Oooh, if you've never been in love before
Then you really don't know what pain is, what pain is

Girl one was the worst one
Who I learned the true meaning of hurt from
Tricked a nigga into thinking he was worth something
Beat me down good as if she rehearsed drums
When I first met her I was mesmerized
Couldn't stop watching her like she was televised
The rest of my life I decided to set aside
Not realizing she was feeding me steady lies
I thought I'd grow old in this relationship
The cold shoulder, didn't know what to make of it
Some nigga'd hold her in his arms and lay naked with
It made me long for days when I would date the chick
Now I'm steady drowning in a pool of pain
Each day it feels as if I'm walking through the rain
Pouring on my heart ensuring a bruise remain
I swear to God, I'll never be made a fool again
Uh

CHORUS: 
If you've never been in love before
Then you really don't know what pain is, what pain is
Oooh, if you've never been in love before
Then you really don't know what pain is, what pain is

The second chick appeared separate
From any characteristic considered negligent
Instead respectable, intelligent and delicate
Sweet and innocent, acted practically celibate
Now I was aware she had some male companions
Totally platonic was to be my understanding
Curious why her time one of 'em demanded
And why his attitude often needed reprimanding
I'm thinking, I ain't argue with girls I can't claim
But can't point to what's bugging me like my hand's sprained
See her story's getting increasingly mad lame
The truth is on the platform, it missed the damn train
See I discovered they once laid together
The fact it happened before us didn't make it better
Now our ties and our trust had to break and sever
Twice burned in the dust, I'm losing faith forever
Damn

CHORUS: 
If you've never been in love before
Then you really don't know what pain is, what pain is
Oooh, if you've never been in love before
Then you really don't know what pain is, what pain is

Third time is the charm, right?
Knew it was love the way she held my arm tight
And stared in my eyes talking throughout the long nights
Finally, it looks like I found the bomb wife
Word up, Caribana Queen talented
Beauty and brains, she was brilliantly balancing
An artist too, she knew all of the challenges
Pursuing passion comes with personal salvages
I got caught off guard by her past
A lifetime is how long she let the hurt last
The target for her tantrums, I got the worst blast
Tempered like teenage sex, I burst fast
Now we've mastered the craft of the argument
Both of us swearing that we never started it
From another woman, now I gotta part again
Being a fish in the sea ain't no compliment
Sing it 

CHORUS: 
Oooh, if you've never been in love before
Then you really don't know what pain is, what pain is
Oooh, if you've never been in love before
Then you really don't know what pain is, what pain is</pre>
