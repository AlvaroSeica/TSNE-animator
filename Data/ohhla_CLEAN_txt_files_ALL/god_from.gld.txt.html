[Intro/Chorus]
You can make it alone, oh if you try
'Til the beat come on, I know you sing it
You can make it alone, if you try
We'll never see you fall, 'til you make it out

[Santigold]
When are you with them if I let it go
You'll either gonna rock the boat, or help them hand it out
Now you're somewhere removed, and think you got it
while you're broke - or are you passin out?
Something that you wrote, it's gonna make a good life quote
Asylum for the call
Rumblin below, say now now you never go
So while we're waiting

[Chorus] - 2X

[Santigold]
It's what you know but you can't tell us so
Just where it you let it go, for fear they'll turn it down
You can see through the smoke, and though you know
that's something wrong, you're holding on for now
Aiming for the mark, how is it that your score's not up?
Like flashlights in the dark
Even with the heart, you know you're better from the start
Don't let it weigh you down

[Chorus] - 2X

[Santigold]
Oh now you leave them alone
You're on your own
Yay yay yooooooo, on your own
Ya ya yoooooo {*2X*}

[Chorus] - 4X</pre>
