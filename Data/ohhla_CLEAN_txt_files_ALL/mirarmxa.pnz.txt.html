T-Weaponz

[Verse 1: Ark {Notch in background}]
I was raised in the slums, that's the barrio
If you heard me on the radio, that's the radio
See, I came to make a change, that means cambio
Now we got ya {*niggas*} all sweatin', here's a pano
That's a napkin
Capitan means I'm captain
Que lo que pasa means what's happenin'
If you see me with my fam, that's my ganga
Shorty got a thong on, that means she got a thanga {Thanga}
If she's dark-skinned, then she's Morena {Morena}
If you want a problem, you lookin' for problemas
And talk means hablando, walk is andando
If you see the cops, scream "Bajando" (Bajando!)
Cause if you are a thief, you a ladron
If you got beef with me, T carry your canon
You see, I'm crazy, a loco vato
Drunk, boracho, that's a rap means tato

Hook: Notch
Mira
Mira, mira, mira
Look, dira
Dira, di lo, te lo
Shook, linda
Linda, dale fuego
Come on, dale fuego
All my callarellos (Crooks)

Chorus: T-Weaponz (Notch in background)
Mira, mira, look, look (Mira, mira, mira, mira, look)
Tienne miedo, they shook, shook (Dira, dira, di lo, te lo, shook)
Shorties que tenga el huevo (Linda, linda, dale fuego)
If {*niggas*} want the flame, tomala el fuego
(Come on, dale fuego, all my callerellos, crooks)

[Verse 2: Chingo Bling]
I got a big booty chick named Vida, Vida-Vida
Una pistola is a heater, heater-heater
Trabajador means I'm, a block greeter
No como la senorita means, I won't eat her, eat her
It's refried, it's a Chingo Bling remix
Limpiale con tissue means clean it with a kleenex
The party full of dudes mean (???) no de weines
Mi gallo es mas chingon, yeah, my rooster be the meanest
Duro en la pintura means I'm hard in the paint
And I'm fuera la cadena means I'm off the chain, cina
Deja la caller, ladies, Drop It Like It's Hot
La chota, that's a cop, balaso, that's a shot
See, don't means chale, and go, that's dale
I, got that work means I got that jale
Not Spanish, not English, I'm speaking Chinglish
Me fui sin testigo means I leave no witness (Chingo Bling)

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Notch]
When me a kick-kickin', yo estoy atacando
Me drink ah Heinekin, yo estoy tomando
When me a light it up, tomos fumando
Police come around, no estamas parando
Llamame soon, come, yo vengo pronto
Oh, you'se a fool, boy, that mean yah done for
A politician telling to you what a lies inside your head

Hambre is hungry, pobo's a dummy
No me veo llegar means nobody saw me coming (Nobody say me comin')

[IzReal]
A thug, (???), thinkin', pensando
Look, man, mirame, you dreamin', sonando (Sonando)
Forget it, olvidare, pray y resando
Just ask, pidale, 'fore I change el cambio (Cambia)
Single's soltera, fire's candela (Candela)
Move, te mueva, like a snake, culebra (Culebra)
