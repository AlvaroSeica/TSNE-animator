(Jodie Mack talking... chorus in background)
Ha ha...It's crazy
You know what I mean
Word up man
These niggas man...they got the game twisted
Tryin to poison these young g's out here man
Groom em right nigga
Stop screamin pimps up hos down nigga
Nigga we love our hos
Ya understand...word to ya mother
I love all my hos
They make this world go round nigga
Ya know what I'm sayin
Ha ha...come on man

(Black Child, Jodie Mack)
It's about time for black on black crime
I'ma massage your body, I'ma massage your mind
I'ma take off your clothes, I'ma go close the blinds
While I warm the jacuzzi, go kick off your shoes
This is good livin boo, I left the weed in the living room
We blazed the blunt then jumped in the swimming pool
The pussy was tight, the head incredible
If m√©nage was the charge, then the case would be federal
Ain't nothing better than baggin a bi-sexual
She'll bag a bitch and they'll both have sex with you
That's what the X'll do, have you breaking their backs
Kept hollerin Black Child, Jodie Mack

(0-1, Young Merc)
And you remember that chick, that up-town bad bitch
Live on 126th somewhere around Lenox
Yeah, I remember when we was on our way to Cali
I scooped her cousin said she was movin to get a bigger salary
She was a down ass bitch like Nicky and Mallory
I hit her with the dick she wanted to marry me
So what about it
I had her cousin in the shower screamin louder and louder
Long dick and feelin the power
I'm fuckin this bitch for hours, I'm about to nut
This bitch put my dick in her mouth and swallowed it up
Now that's what's up
You know how gangsta's roll for the love of the dough
We don't love them hos, nigga


(chorus..Chink Santana)
Niggas that be livin the lives and straight ballin (straight ballin)
Inc is what they call us (what they call us)
If you fuckin with that
then let me hear you say heeeey (daddy can I roll wit ya)
We in the Murder Mansion gettin it on
Tricks, sex and plenty weed till the mornin (weed till the mornin)
If ya fuckin with that
you'll probably hear me say heeeey (shorty rollin wit us)

(D.O Cannon)
You wanna freak me don't ya
I drive you crazy don't I
You wanna keep me ???
You sick your brotha's on me
Let's keep it poppin, pop a bottle to get it crackin
I make it happen, shorty, you're ridin with me

(Ronnie Bumps)
You know you feelin hot, talkin bout you need to stop
I'm like come on ma, you need to stop
Shakin the way you shake
Watin for your big break
House with a big lake
We flyin tonight

(D.O Cannon, Ronnie Bumps)
You can catch us in the club shorty (we buyin tonight)
In the big body 6, girl (we ridin tonight)
Get your hair and your toes done
I'll make sure you feel good
I'll make sure you look good
I'll touch you like a man should
(It's alright) You can shake it like you want it ma
(Freak all night) And when we finished with you girl
(Don't waste my time) You be trippin if you thinkin
that we trickin, spendin money on fur, gangstas

(chorus... Chink Santana)
Niggas that be livin the lives and straight ballin (straight ballin)
Inc is what they call us (what they call us)
If you fuckin with that
then let me hear you say heeeey (daddy can I roll wit ya)
We in the Murder Mansion gettin it on
Tricks, sex and plenty weed till the mornin (weed till the mornin)
If ya fuckin with that
you'll probably hear me say heeeey (shorty rollin wit us)

(Cadillac Tah)
Shorty I see it in your eyes
That you wanna ride
It's painted on your face ma, that you got thug love for gangsta's
So, ma, if you wanna fly, jump inside
I'll take you where you never been and back, on flight with the Cadillac
After that, she'll be runnin back like Joe Morris
I promise, you ain't gon be mad at havin your arms pent
Legs up, gettin that gangsta slum
Radio on, playin that ol school gangsta song
King Kong, gettin gorilla with it
Tryin my best to kill it
Beatin my chest ??? like a vet, mind get left
Leave you drippin wet bitch
I-N-C is the set, it's gangsta

(chorus... Chink Santana)
Niggas that be livin the lives and straight ballin (straight ballin)
Inc is what they call us (what they call us)
If you fuckin with that
then let me hear you say heeeey (daddy can I roll wit ya)
We in the Murder Mansion gettin it on
Tricks, sex and plenty weed till the mornin (weed till the mornin)
If ya fuckin with that
you'll probably hear me say heeeey (shorty rollin wit us)</pre>
