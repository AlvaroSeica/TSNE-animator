(*talking*)
Uh, it's your boy Magno
Putting it down, ya heard
The Rookie of the Year, coming soon baby
Holla, check it

[Magno]
Now you might see Mag, rolling slow in a gray and black
Made back laid back, with the roof raised back
And the haters hate that, I'm grinding everytime
I'm like a diamond homie, shining everytime
I'm rhyming everytime, I gotta stay hungry
Gotta break mics, gotta take flights
From Conroe to Monroe, these haters duck when my gun blow
Every night, I'm fucking more than one hoe
It's Magno ya heard, I gotta wreck when the beat drop
I bust a flow, and make these hoes wanna P-Pop
So I'm really the best, you'll understand why
Once the Rookie of the Year, in your deck
I spit sixteen, and end up with fifty
Try to play boys in the hood, and you might just end up like Ricky
Too much money, my wallet ain't folding at all
I'm a hood nigga, catch me at the hole in the wall ya heard

It's Young Slugga, fuckers
It's Young Slugga, fuckers

Swisha House, Swisha Blast
Ya heard

Dirty 3rd, Freestyle Kingz

Mike Jones got that fire green
(tell him fi-fi-fire it up)
Magno got that fire green
(tell him fi-fi-fire it up)
Dirty 3rd got that fire green
(tell him fi-fi-fire it up)
And Young Slugga got that fire green
(tell him fi-fi-fire it up)</pre>
