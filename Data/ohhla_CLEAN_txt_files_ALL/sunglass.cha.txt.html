1 - I wear my sunglasses at night
     So I can, so I can
     Keep track of visions in my eyes

Repeat 1

Yo pretty feisty ain't she, eighteen she can't be
Heard he was some broad getting over then that ain't me
Cause I'm that broad that their broads tell more broads about
And on their mouths is the mouths my name won't stay out
Big benjamining in the slimming
And see me, I keeps in it
Chrome spinning window tinted
I can see me all up in it
It's only summer I have him moving out before fall
How the misses gon' let the mistress steal dough from y'all?
Have him taking me to the places he don't go with y'all
Be the one he sneak and call when he out with y'all
Come on y'all gotta admit it's kind of good to be young
Got his whip, got him whipped, and she don't know what's going on
Yeah I ran that bank account, spent everything in it
Took the credit cards, pushed the Visa to the limit
She be so nieve too the things you believe boo
If I was you I'd be rocking these sunglasses too, come on

Repeat 1

I see this industry gon' love me or hate me
But y'all aren't fans, ain't gonna make me or break me
It takes you a year to get a hit I can't relate see
Cause what you doing in minutes, seconds it takes me
Ain't got no choice so take your verbal spanking like a troop
We're all actors and I'm whooping your whole cast and crew
I make this vow if it's the last thing a sister do
To rip this mic until I'm out of breath or black or blue
This is going out to all your rappers who be acting new
Give me my props or I'mma take them like a rapist do
And why you females hatin' me cause I ain't hatin' you?
I'll take your man for a second but I'll give him back to you
Ain't trying to keep him every state have a him and you
If you were in these sneaker shoes you would do it too
So understand y'all just got picked out of the chosen few
But he gon' always gonna think of me when he holding you
What'cha wanna do? Come on

Repeat 1

I make 'em come up out the cuffs quick to touch this Miss Luscious
Make you see how much you miss from the broad you fuss with
Ask a friend if you don't know-oh, vanilla slash cocoa
I be dipping your five to the uh-oh
Messing with that Sebring chick, touch knee deep quick
And if need be switched cause the team is getting thick
I keeps all I leave with ain't nothing strategic
Broads see chick wanna be chick
Without cause, sea sick
So if you really just going there buying a Benz
Moving that kind of weight, getting them kind of ends
Count me in, you really trying to ball and spin
In front all you men, I rock these shades for all you men

Repeat 1 till end</pre>
