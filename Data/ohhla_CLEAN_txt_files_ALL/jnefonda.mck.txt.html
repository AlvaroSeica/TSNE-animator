Typed by: erikaldrich@hotmail.com

I had a baby named Jane
She could shake that thing
Said her Daddy used to hang
With Johnny Coltrane
She sang a soul train
With her friend named Jen
Her booty was bigga than a Mercedes Benz
Jen was a herdy-gerdy-dirty little girly
I heard it from a birdy
She could cook a mean turkey
With gravy, baby baby baby
Baby was Jen's best friend, and maybe..
If you were lucky,
Licky licky, sucky sucky
Mickey, Mickey, fuck me fuck me
More junk in the trunk than a Honda
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda

One, two, three, four
Get your booty on the dance floor.
Work it out, shake it little momma
Let me see you do the Jane Fonda.
Five, six, seven now
If you don't know, let me show you how
To work it out
work it little momma
I know you wanna do the Jane Fonda

I had a princess, queen of incest
She was (in Reba Jean her) big breasts
And big eyes and a big ass to match
Jean wasn't fat, she was easy to catch
Then came Molly your hood from Hollywood High
So fly she was trans-Atlantic
She was a manic depressive (manic depressive)
Which was impressive,
Very impressive, I had to test it.
Tasted like chicken and was lemon scented.
She took me home to her momma
I taught them both how to Jane Fonda

[Chorus]

I had a girl named Dana
From Santa Anna
She was a waitress at the Copa Cabana
She was slamming and her ass was jamming
Like Janet Jackson in the Rhythm Nation
Her brother Jason had a girl named Grace
You could see her ass from outer space
So I landed on the planet
And planted a Mickey Av flag in it dammit

[Chorus x2]</pre>
