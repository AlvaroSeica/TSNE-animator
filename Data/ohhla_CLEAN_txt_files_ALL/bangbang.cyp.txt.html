"Shot down"
"Shot down"
"Shot down"
"Shot down, bang bang"
"Shot down, bang bang"
"Shot down, bang bang"
"Shot down, bang bang"
"Shot down"

[B Real]
This is for all those haters and imitators
Take your medicine, you won't like the flavor
The taste ain't sweet, we laced that beat
Never forget how we play in the street
Never forget what you say in the street
If you talk too loud, get laid with the heat
You want that cake, and yeah you can't stop us
Out the gate we take those dollars
Get a clue while we doing some real shit
Me and the Dog steady pushin' the Hill shit
We flip scripts like dough boys flip bricks
Get money like lottery quick picks
We're sick wit' it and homie I'm quick witted
Still in the game, insane we still spit it
Top level, livin' like a rebel
Settle down bitch, yo we split that metal

(CHORUS)
Remember when your motherfuckers, "Shot down"
Tried to take what's mine, "Shot down"
Niggas left me for dead, "Shot down"
But I'll never forget, "Shot down, bang bang"
Payback, "shot down, bang bang"
Payback, "Shot down, bang bang"
Payback, "Shot down, bang bang"
Payback, "Shot down"

[Sen Dog]
I came up in the game doin' my thang for the paper
Never gonna change, biggy bang on them haters
They used to gang bang on the corners where I came up
Dropped 'Insane' now the world's with the flavor
I remember when you niggas used to front on me
Everywhere I ride I kept a gun on me
I only used to listen to my one O.G.
He said 'Get money, but stay low key'
So it's the payback, 'cause I pay it in the back
Whole world get high when I say it on a track
And I stay with a gat, I'm never gonna slip
Quick to hit 'em up if you ever wanna trip
All it takes is a hit and you never gon' forget
When you smoked on the Hill on a kill that we twist
Fuck a shot, we takin' the whole fifth
And I ride around wit' killas, you know we don't miss

(Chorus)

"Shot down"
"Shot down"
"Shot down"
"Shot down, bang bang"
"Shot down, bang bang"
"Shot down, bang bang"
"Shot down, bang bang"
"Shot down"</pre>
