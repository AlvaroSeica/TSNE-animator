[Intro]
I'M BACK! I'm on my Dipset shit, 20-30 grand in one pocket, foreign car
outside...living life fast, you niggaz need to catch up, slow pokes
NYC...Here We Go Again!

DIP,DIP SET! I GET ON EXTRA GRIND, I GET ON EXTRA GRIND, I GET ON EXTRA
GRIND...WHEN IT'S, WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME
WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME, WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME, WHEN IT'S REPPIN
TIME, WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME

[Chorus One]
I GET ON EXTRA GRIND, I GET ON EXTRA GRIND
I GET ON EXTRA GRIND WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME (DIP DIPSET!)
WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME, WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME (DIPSET)
WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME, WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME (DIP DIPSET!)

It's Dipset Season, you ready to grind? Get money, rep yours, what you know
about that? Everyday we hustle, you hear me, YOU HEAR ME? I got money on my
mind man, we the talk of New York
you niggaz want action, I got a movie for ya!

[Jim Jones]
I'm in the coupe relaxing (like that)
you see the roof collapsing (drop the top!)
I got my paper up although I'm still kufi smacking! (smack the shit out you!)
And it's God fearing, foreign car steering
60 thou Jabar wearing, just beat a trial hearing
You should catch me walking cocky out the courtroom (diddy bopping!)
Like eat my dust, a buck 40 for the Porsche zoom (ZOOOOOOOOOM!)
Back in population (what else?)
we cop drops to race 'em (BALLIIIING!)
we getting money over here WHAT'S YOUR OCCUPATION?!?!
We on top of things, and we got them things (them birds)
But we only sell them birds, you tryna cop a wing? (you a petty hustler)
I know the real Rich...the REAL Richard Porter
RIP he left the hood to us, we own the corners! (HARLEM!)
The bright lights and my big city
my ice bright and the wrist silly (FLOSSIIIIIIING!)
I'm risking Fed time, front page headline
make the pedal hit the floor til the throttle red line!

[Chorus Two]
DIP DIP DIP DIPSET! WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME, WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME (DIPSET)
WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME, WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME (DIPSET)
WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME, WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME (DIPSET)
WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME, WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S REPPIN TIME (DIP DIPSET!)

[Jim Jones]
I let my pants sag (why?), so I can show my ass (KISS MY ASS!)
It's twenty g's a pocket, that's cause we blowing cash (that's NOTHING!)
And when the photo's flash (SMILE!), Gallardies going pass
Lights, camera's, autographs..."Wet Willies", call a cab
The fast life is pricey, the time piece is icey (BLINGING!)
And my niggaz moving fish scale just like the Pisces!
Momma raised a thug, lawyers when we face the judge (Kelina!)
This is the chance we take to try and put ya brain on drugs
...and we invade the clubs standing on the furniture
Throwing gang signs, two stepping with our burners tucked (EASTSIIIIDE!)
and we will burn you up like three star alarm
WE ARE THE BOMB HUNDRED G'S ON THE CHARM (Byrd Gang!)
You'd think I own the cleaners how I wash that paper
And now we at the dealer tryna cop all flavors (BALLIIIIIIING!)
We at the dealer dog (yeah), so how you feeling y'all?!?
....just tear the ceiling off, fuck the light we peeling off!

[Chorus Two]

[Chorus One]

[Jim Jones]
The young and the restless...live life reckless
House money on the necklace the pigs want him arrested
Cause I'm obsessed with the guns and the vest's
cause when you get some cake, the candles come with a death wish!
The rock star living (what else?), the hot cars and women (LAVISH LIFE!)
...the God forgive him, hope the cop cars don't get 'em (SQUALIIIIIIIIE!)
This for them niggaz that...at the club, throwing stacks (BALLIN!)
At Star Wars, they threw two I threw four back!
and I'm back, it's Mr. New York City
My hat to the back, I stay flyer than a Frisbee
We still diddy bopping (yeah)
we still could get it poppin (yeah!)
ain't nothing change but the year of the Range
And the clouds still moving with the squamy (loaded)
and the gangsta's don't die, we get MONEEEEY and move to Miami!

When it's repping time, I get on extra grind
40 cal, an extra nine Dipset the cities mine!
