[Werd]
Time is of the essence so I'm blessing every second
And my weapon is my pen in dire need of session
So I give it some attention and the tension I was stressing
Seems to vanish, and I thank you for the lessons life
But this mic it might make a slight change
Misplaced faith in fate will get you no name
Mistake work for luck, have you no brains
Sit back and think about that up in you're old age
(ha) And I aint saying I ever made doe
But you geeks acting like Al Pachi-no
Stop lying ya bam 
With you're comical acts you should be playing at The Stand
(stand up) nah you can sit down
Shut up son, you're about as hot as the moon
So jotting on the paper it should be understood
You're under me, underground and under my foot (defeat)

Used the brain, used the heart this time
With each beat you can tell that I'm
Trying in vain, with all of my rhymes
But that's fine I put my heart inside [x2]

Feeling all depressive, like my sentences pathetic
Either feel it or respect it all I ask is you accept it
See my accent retrospective of the city I'm connected
My perspective and objective's are selective yet extensive but
I'm defensive yet defenseless in this presence
And in dire need of reasons to keep keeping with the present
Comprehensive, yes my pen is, but its harder when I pen it
When the others half's reflected and it's hardly isometric
From the Werd side, Drew back to the full tide
Washed out thoughts in a wave in a sound bite
Some like, some hate but it's alright
Motivation takes many forms in my dull life
Does life, consist of what we make it?
And if so, is it confined to no other basis
If I hold myself back why do I waste it?
I'll just speak from the heart, its all I got

Used the brain, used the heart this time
With each beat you can tell that I'm
Trying in vain, with all of my rhymes
But that's fine I put my heart inside [x4]</pre>
