[Intro]
My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful
So much charm

[Verse 1]
The only lady I can ever mess bonds with
On some atomic bond shit, our love is plutonic
But I just can't, put my foot on it
My one and my only
We not only, lovers but homies
Whenever I'm lonely, right on time she arrives
She know the business for some minutes
I bury that kitty alive
Although I'm kidding but I really be in it
And we don't plan on having kiddies but I really be skinnin' really be raw
They say sex is the weapon
Love is really a war
And sometimes I feel threatened cos she really know all
My weaknesses
Sometimes we fight, won't speak and shit
But we both know what the sequence is
It's like a never-ending cycle
Something like your menstrual
The day you put your menopause
I'll pause the instrumentals
[?]
She got me in the mental
Me and you until the end of time
Till we no longer existential

[Chorus x2]
Right on time
You are my love
(This ain't nothing like a consistent, persistence
We'll be switching positions
My mission's to put you in the best conditions)

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
They say one mans trash is another mans treasure
No, one man's clever, one knows no better
I like to go get her to keep her warm in cold weather
She blow below better then she goes for endeavors
Write our names on the clouds in bold letters
If hoes ever touch me she load Berettas
But trust me, she's lusty it must be me
Rubbin it off on her skin
I can't budge her, a pen?
I swear that her love is just a sin
We back at it again
Fussin and fightin I start cussin she cryin
Break up to make up
I start cuttin' then slide it in
Then we mix the vibe with some Hen
You got five, I got ten
Now we some trippy niggas as high as a fin
But what's your game love? Already know it
We some ordinary people but extraordinary poets
Get lost in the moment when I po' it
Fuck it if we drownin in pain coz we don't really show it

[Chorus x2]

My eyes have never seen someone so beautiful
So much charm [x2]</pre>
