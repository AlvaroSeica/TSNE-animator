Yo money, here's a funky-ass bassline
Like a ray from the sun you taste sunshine
All in your face and there's no doubt about that jack
They see me on the stage and people say well how bout that?
Sure he's kinda funky, original and spunky
I'm the guy, in the Bugle Boy jeans, and your the monkey
Ridin on the escalator of life, always stayin idle
.. when it comes to your recital
You never elevate your rigormortis stay in motion
But you're EFFORTLESS, when it comes to the rest
of what you can't even hang, you can't even swing
They say stop battlin rhymin, I say I'm doin my thing
When it's time to give a message that's appropriate I give it
That's the way I live my life and that's the way I choose to live it
So get off mine, when it comes to the rhyme
And just, do your job and write your line
Buggin on the zig-zag

[Tony D]
This is a jam about the headlines and the backtalks
The editorial memorial wack talk
that I like to classify condemn then quarantine
when you listen to it, or read it in a magazine
False advertisement in the media ain't no joke
It's a lie that they know, and quote exactly what you spoke
They like to make up shit and maybe change a word or two
When was the last time you suckers, heard a few
questions or comments or complaints from the public
I needed a name for the media so I dubbed it
Zig-zag, meaning this is meaningless scrabble, scribble
They like to let the ink dribble
out of their pens and into the minds of the youth
.. falsifying the truth
So, stop the pressed cause them assist the town crier
You got voted, number one liar
Buggin on the zig-zag

{*"I can't hold it back, I'm lookin for the line.." -&gt; Rakim*}

[Tony D]
Situations, seem to get blown out of proportion
That's why THIS is a means of extortions
When it's time to zig-zag, they be zaggin and ziggin
by usin a pen like a shovel then it's time to start diggin
up dirt, to make the front page headlines work
But you're nothin but a ballpoint jerk
who's just SITTIN THERE, lookin stupid at your typewriter
Tryin to make the noose, just a little bit tighter
around my neck, but I slipped it and did a backflip
Landed on your typewriter, then I smashed it
against the wall then I trashed your whole office
Just to let you know that the D ain't the softest
It was said before, I'ma say it again my friend
"Don't Believe the Hype," 'til the end
So get off mine, when it comes to the rhyme
And just, do your job and write your line
Buggin on the zig-zag

[Tony D]
Yo that weak and wack zig-zaggin
Taggin up them headlines with that wack negative garbage
ain't gonna last, y'knowhatI'msayin?
So let me say like this, I must say what's up
to the six foot and over posse, rulin things for the 90's
Y'knowhatI'msayin?  Also to my man SP and Davy Wavy
Y'knowhatI'mtalkin?  My man Troy Wonder
Of course you know who the family is
And anybody else I forgot, we most definitely in there for the 90's
Y'knowhatI'msayin?  Harvey, is signin out like this, moneyyyyy</pre>
