[Intro]
Powder! Summertime, summer grind some won't

[Verse One]
Look at the degrees, it say 90 but it feel like a hun' though
I'm Hot Boy Troy, who you think that they come fo'?
The bad bitches the mad niggas that's who my gun fo'
Blast hit ya then blast them they both done fo'
Five on the hippy, five in the whippy
Me and Sevin in the seven series with your bimmy
And two friends, yellin no new friends givin 'em D
Rakin in dough, crew love end for the week shit
Barbeque on the block, too dark for beaches
My smooth features Sunkist, orange g shit
Peel back top on a ill back drop
Oh that's my homey Jay Dough, put away that glock
My shooters be ready and deadly, I trained them well
My women be plenty and friendly, they kiss don't tell
The fish 'gon fry and sell in the kitchen
We movin on up, free all my niggas from they cells for intermission

[Chorus]
Ball player swag when it's hot out
Bunch of fly bitches outside when it's hot out
90 degrees, only right I bring the drop out
Slippin please, you know I'm here with the glock out
Movin all white like Jesus, ice no freezes
Niggas can't see us and the girls wanna freak us
Summertime Troy Ave comin out the speakers (Powder!)
Find me on the block with my A-didas!

[Verse Two]
I made, classic moves and classic streams
With a cuban link on these some classic dreams
My homey Yankee pushed the red porche on the ball court
Then the girls walked acrossed yeah we like short shorts
Well we got all sorts, black, white, asians
Them spanish girls from La Marena, look amazin
When they be gazin we blazin playin spades and
Then Johnny come open hold it down don't spray him
Mami with the poker water gun super soaker
But only wet he rhair if you payin to do it over
'Cause chicks get mad and trip like Six Flags
High rollers no coasters for the cups place cash on the floor
Dice game for twenty or more
No ass better just mad cheddar, it's the allure
Of the streets, mixed in with the heat
In this jungle of concrete I got soft for cheap, word! 

[Chorus]
Ball player swag when it's hot out
Bunch of fly bitches outside when it's hot out
90 degrees, only right I bring the drop out
Slippin please, you know I'm here with the glock out
Movin all white like Jesus, ice no freezes
Niggas can't see us and the girls wanna freak us
Summertime Troy Ave comin out the speakers (Powder!)
Find me on the block with my A-didas!

[Outro]
Summertime summer grind some are known some a shine
I'm just gettin money representin for the streets
Summertime summer grind some are known some a shine
I'm just gettin money representin for the streets
Summertime summer grind some are known some a shine
I'm just gettin money representin for the streets
Summertime summer grind some are known some a shine
I'm just gettin money representin for the streets
Nigga! Scram Jones on the beat, Troy Ave add the powder with the heat
Nobody can compete, it's that fuck nigga defeat
Get it defeat........
