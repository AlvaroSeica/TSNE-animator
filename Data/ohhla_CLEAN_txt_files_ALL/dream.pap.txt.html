[Intro]
To e'rybody in the struggle, we 'gon rise
Fame and fortune, and live the nacirema dream
Let's go

[Chorus]
The nacirema dream, enjoyin life's finer things
I want my lady to live like a queen
She want her man to live like a king
It's bada bing, chi ching and bling bling
Nacirema dream, big cars and diamond rings
I want my mother to live like a queen
She want her son to live like a king
It's bada bing, chi ching and bling bling
Nacirema dream

[Verse One]
God reveal my treasure
I always knew I would build my cheddar
Pop Chris like Webber, everybody who felt my pain
I want y'all to feel my pleasure
When people said I wouldn't get a deal I never
Listen 'cause who ain't told me I'm ill I'm better
But I still had to hustle so grams I measured
Always had a way out 'cause skills I endeavored 
You jumpin over me to be the king not clever
You lose 'cause life is a game of chess not checkers
Ownin property, finally found the treasury I strive
To see away from the, jeopardy, robbery, ecstasy
No poverty whether your plan is treachery, lottery
You steal from, ebony to ivory
So now my mama don't got to worry kids don't got to worry
I got more dead presidents then a cemetery
 
[Chorus]
The nacirema dream, enjoyin life's finer things
I want my lady to live like a queen
She want her man to live like a king
It's bada bing, chi ching and bling bling
Nacirema dream, big cars and diamond rings
I want my mother to live like a queen
She want her son to live like a king
It's bada bing, chi ching and bling bling
Nacirema dream

[Verse Two]
Watchin that flat screen cable
Eatin like kwanzaa over the kitchen table
Everyday I'm gettin calls from another label
Remember when I use to boost more than jumper cables
Livin in this nacirema dream I'm able
To push the maybach like a extra day at april
I'm nice, I rock ice just like ike
Anyone Vanilla Ice, Ice-T, Just Ice
Ice Cube, ice dude, make the right move
I'm a leader niggas follow me just like rules
'Cause I'm the Bed-Stuy, livin, ten pie flippin
Next guy gettin on the lex drive mission
Pump the best lie, givin, N.Y. pimpin
Watchin Tel-i-vision in the lex I'm whippin
Nacirema dream, It's american spelled backwards
Livin the american dream is what I practice

[Chorus]
The nacirema dream, enjoyin life's finer things
I want my lady to live like a queen
She want her man to live like a king
It's bada bing, chi ching and bling bling
Nacirema dream, big cars and diamond rings
I want my mother to live like a queen
She want her son to live like a king
It's bada bing, chi ching and bling bling
Nacirema dream

[Verse Three]
Fish don't fry in the kitchen (Nacirema!) Beans don't burn on the grill (Dream!)
Took a hole, 'lot of t-ryin, just to get me a record deal (Nacirema!)
Now I'm way up in the big league (Dream!) Gettin my turn at bat (Nacirema!)
As long as me rich, you and me baby
Ain't nothin wrong with that
I remember when they, use to call us the free lunch bunch
Now we sign autographs when they see us run
Hop in the airplane, then we up up
And away all day while you re-up chump
When we land in your city, they feed us lunch
We touchdown like, one two, three hut hut
I'm the reflection of this, I learned these tactics
Put the word in the mirror watch it reflect backwards

[Chorus]
The nacirema dream, enjoyin life's finer things
I want my lady to live like a queen
She want her man to live like a king
It's bada bing, chi ching and bling bling
Nacirema dream, big cars and diamond rings
I want my mother to live like a queen
She want her son to live like a king
It's bada bing, chi ching and bling bling
Nacirema dream
