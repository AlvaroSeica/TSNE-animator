Album:  Crack
Song:   If That's How You Feel
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus - 2x]
If you wanna dance to this, dance if that's how ya feel
But my body don't move like that, so I'ma chill
I'ma play the wall, leaving all the dancing to y'all
But we can party, till somebody call the laws

[Z-Ro]
Hey you can lean with it, rock with it if you wanna
You can even chicken noodle soup but me, I'ma be in the corner
With a drank in my hand, checking out the spot
Baby girl do what Snoop told ya to do, and drop it like it's hot
Rhythm is taking over you, don't stop it like it's not
Act like you from New Orleans, and pussy popping I'ma watch
But since I'm by myself, I got pump on me
Watching out for my enemies, cause I know they'd love to jump or dump on me
Plus I got diamonds, big as Lisa Raye's lips
And every time I hit the club, I let my chain hang like Lil' Flip
I know them jackers, be out to get me dude
But like Bone Crusher I'm never scared, it's a gangsta standing in my shoes
I'ma leave the dancing to y'all, keeping my back on the wall
Man I'm so drunk if I wasn't a playa, I'd probably fall
I'm a head buster
But I don't think I'm better than nobody else, I just can't move like Usher

[Chorus - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
I'm in chill mode homie, ain't no fronting and faking
Steady laughing at these niggaz out here, bouncing and shaking
Having drinks in the VIP, I'm so clean
I see some fellas in the crowd, with a dance routine
They got the same clothes on, they rolling and tripping
A couple of broads walk by, they start popping and ticking
Got my back on the wall, in the club we roll
And as far as Don go, it's Southsiding at the show
I'm on the stage getting busy, trying to do my work
And all I see is them lil' jeans, and them tight ass shirts
God damn lil' homie, what the world coming to
I'm from the old school mayn, we don't dance to Screw
Trying to really get my pimp on, broads is bopping
But I'm checking out these niggaz out here, shocking and rocking
Let em all do they thang, cause the game is fair
But I'm a gangsta from the South, and we don't do that there

[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Now you can Harlem shuffle, or electric slide
But I'm like Triple Six Mafia, moving my body from side to side
Instead of doing the two step, I shoot two techs
I ain't even gon' Crip walk, even though I'm down with the blue set
Cause we don't dance, in the Screwed Up Click
Unless you talking about boxing, we can do that shit
Looking for a cigarillo, to put my dosha in
Moving slow motion, like I'm Juvenile and Soulja Slim
The club is full of females, chocolate ass caramels and bad ass yellow bones
Trying to put they digits, in my telephone
The music is bumping, people throwing they hands in the air
But other than bobbing my head, I'ma just stand there
Homie, you know I got my weapon in my pocket
I might accidentally shoot up the club, if I accidentally drop it
So I'm playing it safe, cause the moves I make
Are Scarface, I can't do the Justin Timberlake nigga

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
