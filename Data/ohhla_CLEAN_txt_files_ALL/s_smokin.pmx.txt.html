1, 2, 3, ready?, sing

[Big Heavy singing]
I love weed, you love weed, its the best without the seeds
Home grown fine, but the chronic ain't jokin', the PxMxWx is still fuckin' smokin'

[Big Heavy talking]
Yo D, I think we need to drop somethin' for the nine tre,and nine four, to let 'em know
That we still fuckin' smokin', gettin' sessed out, gettin' full, and gettin' full of it
So why don't you drop somethin', for the for real niggaz

[PxMxWx]
When I first started out I only smoked one kind
And that was home grown weed 'cause I had it on my mind
I had to make a song about the red hair sess
I had to tell you motherfuckers that that is the best
Along came Dre talkin' bout the fuckin' chronic
Now I'm hooked on the weed, like ya hooked on phonics
Dumb motherfucker, don't talk no shit
'Cause the Iber-villain niggaz got me hooked on the spliff
Picked out the seeds, let me see what ya got
????? fire sessamilia take ya to the hot spot
Yes I'm smokin' on the chronic, and I'm smokin' on the indo
I'm smokin' on the weed, and my mama don't know
Ya buy a pack of dubs ya split it in the middle
Fill it up with a dime and ya kick the weed riddle
Hey diddle diddle, with the weed in the middle
All you broke ass hoes, come and play with me fiddle
Hickery dickery dock, the mouse ran up the clock
If ya fuckin' with my spliff, then ya might get popped
I say Jack be nimble, and Jack be quick
But if ya want some of this, ya gotta suck Jack dick
Now ha ha ha ha, all you wannabe smokers
Tryin' to make a weed rap, PxMxWx ain't jokin'
Now c'mon, c'mon, let us give ya a lift
Bring ya ass in the Ville and i'm smoke a big spliff
I got the fire sessamilia, the fire sessamilia
I got plenty weed, 'cause I'm a dope dealer
Niggaz come a runnin' when I bring out the product
And girls go to sweatin' when I bring the narcotic
And I don't give a damn if you know who I am
And I don't give a fuck about the man, so c'mon, c'mon
If ya know what I mean, and light a big spliff for New Orleans

[Chorus]
I said yes me still smokin'
Yes me still smokin' (7x)

[PxMxWx]
The indo and chronic, the red hair sess, thai sticks and gold buds, yes thats the best
But I can't forget what I plant with the seed, And up from the ground came fire weed
Me took me some weed, and me rolled it up, yes my brother, I fired it up
Me got the fire weed, that fire weed, ooh I like that fire weed
That fire weed, that fire weed, ooh I like that fire weed
Say bounce for the weed, bounce for the weed
Biggety bounce for the weed, bounce for the weed
I said bounce for the weed, bounce for the weed
Biggety bounce for the weed, bounce for the weed
Ooh Chuck, things are gonna get easier
Ooh Chuck, things are gonna get brighter
Ooh Chuck, things are gonna get easier
Ooh Chuck, things are gonna get brighter

[Chorus]

[Big Heavy]
Yes we smoke indo, yes we smoke chronic, yes we smoke sess, yes we smoke weed

Yes we smoke indo, yes we smoke chronic, yes we smoke sess, yes we smoke weed

[PxMxWx]
So pass that weed to them 3rd Ward niggaz
Pass that weed to them 4th Ward niggaz
Pass that weed to them 5th Ward niggaz
Pass that weed to them 7th Ward niggaz
Pass that weed to them 8th Ward niggaz
Pass that weed to them 9th Ward niggaz
Pass that weed to them 10th Ward niggaz
Pass that weed to them Uptown niggaz

[Chorus]

[PxMxWx]
I got a have a weed, say I got a have a weed
I got a have a weed, 'cause thats what I need
I got a have a weed, yes I got a have a weed
I got a have a weed, 'cause thats what I need

[PxMxWx talking]
For the nine tre and nine four, always remember, a friend with weed is a friend indeed
You know what I'm sayin', Big Man in the house, MC Heavy in the motherfucker
Ayo Heavy man, I'm bout to go in the back and roll up some of this motherfuckin' chronic
Smoke my motherfuckin' ass to death, won't you keep a eye on the front door man
Motherfuckers talkin' bout some vans are passin' by this bitch
I don't need no laws knockin' my motherfuckin' door down, already said fuck 5-0
You know what I'm sayin', I'mma go in the back, chill, and smoke this big blunt
Keep a eye out for a nigga

[Big Heavy talking]
Man, not only fuck 5-0, fuck ATF, the DEA, and any other federal agent
