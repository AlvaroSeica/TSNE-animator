So let me ask "Who's the baddest?"
Compositions are classic
Ask me to blaze a track like I'd really deny the chance to
Prove who's the savage (who)

Hip hop addict (who)
Spits hot lava and impacts a track with cancer (and)
Smashed the cornerstone of your home like Caroline did in "Traffic"
And hone every poem with lyrics sicker than average (yuck)
I'm sicker than your average (plus)
The only rapper outside of Hammer you can't touch
Now adjust

Do not attempt to adjust your dial
Nah. It's going down. Go!

I adjust my rhyme style with every 4 bars up
Crush the rhyme style competitors would thought of
Ease the crowds ire with metaphor star dust
And seethe more weed than Ortho Round Up
Get your bars up, n!ggas, or get tossed up
N!ggas looking star struck every time I start up
'Cuz when I start up, all I cause is large buzz
Spawned through y'all drawn and always on
I go on
'Cuz y'all asked me
To please proceed with verse
That's like asking
Me to go beast or worst
So I'll beast a verse
Traverse a quick cadence
Seal your hearse and disperse a writ statement
Blaze the scene 'til you need a stripped face lift
Drain your chi 'til it's gleaned for swift taking
And leave you shaking
Kin to a sick baby
Similar to the feeling of getting stricken by Raiden

Or......

Getting slit by Jason
Getting kicked by Jade
Or getting hit with a stray in the middle of broad -- day
To the feeling of Jay with "The Takeover"
Mos with "The Rapeover"
Nas when he killed Jay
Joe when he killed Jay
Or Joe when he killed Game
Goddamnit, I plan to Joe Budden the game
Spew nothing but flames
Bestow nothing by rage
Incinerate these n!ggas like Shang did Liu Kang
So don't ask me
To proceed with verse
'Cuz I'll smash the
First emcee to burst at me and anyone thinking of spitting at RAREBREED
Don't even think about spitting at RAREBREED or
W--I--B</pre>
