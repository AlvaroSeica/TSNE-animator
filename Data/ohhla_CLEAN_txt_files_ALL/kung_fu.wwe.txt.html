[Dice Raw]
(Kung Fu Naki!) Kung Fu Naki baby yeah
(Kung Fu Naki!) Yeah Kung Fu Naki comin for ya yeah
(Kung Fu Naki!) I see you now, yeah
(Kung Fu Naki!) Kung Fu Naki yeah
(Kung Fu Naki!) Gotta believe he wasn't born in Milwaukee
(Kung Fu Naki!) Mighta grown up in Nagasaki, yeah
(Kung Fu Naki!) Learned to use his hands when he studies karate
(Kung Fu Naki!) Teaches you to say he was a little too Naki

Fu Naki likes to, fish for croppie
While he listens, to Pavarotti
Heard he tried to be, a rap disc jockey
Didn't work out, moved to Abu Dhabi
Guess the rest is, histor-aty
But my memory, a little bit groggy

[Chorus: Singers]
Kung Fu Naki, see the kung fu man
Ohhh he is still the real with lightning hands

(Kung Fu Naki!) Yeah baby Kung Fu Naki where you been man
(Kung Fu Naki!) Kung Fu Naki
(Kung Fu Naki!) Kung Fu Na-kiiii
(Kung Fu Naki!) Ha ha ha ha ha
(Kung Fu Naki!) He loves to cook chicken teriyaki
(Kung Fu Naki!) Cooks in a broth made of rice wine sake
(Kung Fu Naki!) Hehehe, likes the way Stallone says YO in Rocky
(Kung Fu Naki!) Often eats a meal with a little biscotti

Fu Naki likes to, watch Hard Copy
But he thinks it's a little bit too gossipy
Doesn't like people, who act real snobby
Says politicians, are way too talky
Says some wrestlers, are way too cocky
Cause they bodies are soft and sloppy

[Chorus]

(Kung Fu Naki!) Kung Fu Naki baby yeah
(Kung Fu Naki!) Yeah Kung Fu Naki comin for ya yeah
(Kung Fu Naki!) What'cha gon' do, ha ha!
(Kung Fu Naki!) Kung Fu Na-kiiii
(Kung Fu Naki!) Uh-huh, that's it, yeahhhh
(Kung Fu Naki!) Uh-huh, Kung Fu Naki baby
