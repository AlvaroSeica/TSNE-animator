Blood, Cuz, gangbangers
And there's thugs and pimps and dope slingers
You got to have knowledge in this world
You might get your purse snatched before your eyes swirl
You're doin' your job every day
But then you work so hard till your hair turns gray
But let me tell you everybody, that's the way it's ( ? )
You gotta have a ( ? )
Money will take your mind
We gotta be strong now and fight crime
People screamin every day that it ain't no job
Walk the street night and day makin daily rob
I remember the days of my way
People didn't even know what dope paid
People in this world don't know what to do
It seems like magic, also voodoo

I've got radio activity
I've got radio activity

Out of work, out of play, all hustle and trouble
May I say ( ? ) cause the jeopardy double
Who's callin the shots, what rights have I got?
Why must I always be put on the spot?
Must I keep a low pro, so I won't be robbed?
It's hard to find a job in this day and age
Trouble on the street just can't be beat
It's hard to compete with the thugs in the heat

Cuz, Blood, gangbangers
And there's thugs and pimps and dope slingers
You got to have knowledge in this world
You might get your purse snatched before your eyes swirl
You're doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard till your hair turns gray
But let me tell you everybody, that's the way it's ( ? )
You gotta have a ( ? )

Who that tryin to be bad?
Who that, who that, who that tryin to be bad?
Who that, who that, who that tryin to be bad?
(Say what?)
Who that, who that, who that tryin to be bad?

A bullet went by, I didn't know what it was
It was all about 'Blood' and it was all about 'Cuz'
He was shot in the brain by a violent street gang
Died on the corner with his girlfriend ( ? )
His girlfriend ran fast as she could
Tried to get help while the others stood
Just lookin around, sayin 'Who's on the ground?
Is there money in his pocket to be found?'
Kids smokin sherm or sniffin cocaine
Kickin back waitin for fame
Insane in the brain what you will be
If cocaine you're smokin, you see?
Ha - Believe in me like a A-B-C
Don't live yo life in no mysery
Remember the days that we kept it live
With Temptations and the Jackson 5?

Hey buddy buddy, hey buddy buddy
I say
Hey buddy buddy, hey buddy buddy
If you can dig it you can get it you can get on down
(I say)
Hey buddy buddy, hey buddy buddy
I say
Hey buddy buddy, hey buddy buddy
If you can dig it you can get it you can get on down
Hey buddy buddy, hey buddy buddy

Hey buddy buddy, hey buddy buddy
If you can dig it you can get it you can get on down
Hey buddy buddy, hey buddy buddy

Hey buddy buddy, hey buddy buddy
If you can dig it you can get it you can get on down

I've got radio activity
I've got radio activity

You're headed to a dance and your power button's on
With radioactivity in your bone
You got five to get in, you wanna have fun
Ha-ha, but a fool comes up to you with a gun
He takes your money and he's outta sight
And right just then he ( ? )
But as you're walkin home the boys roll up
And say: 'Hold it right there, put your hands up'
Girls gettin pregnant, pimps on the prowl
Prostitutes everywhere to show you how
Money in your pocket, where did it go?
You gave it to your homebody to get you some coke
Grandma goin mad
He assist her with a pad
But he hustles in the city
Tryina make a good penny
( ? ) your car they took it
Streets so bad you can't overlook it

I've got radio activity
I've got radio activity

I looked for a job in the classified ads
I looked ten places, you can even ask dad
I went downtown ( ? )
( ? ) for the next time around
I was mad at the man and not at myself
I said, 'I'm gonna take somethin from somebody else'
People goin crazy cause in the eighties
You got to have a car to catch the ladies

Big bad brother thinkin he tough
Walkin down the street tryina be rough
Little old lady comin home from the bank
Set to go home is what she thinks
Big bad brother comes up from behind
Scares the old lady out of her mind
Snatches her purse and he's on the run
So the lady takes him off the set with a gun</pre>
