Typed by: Cno Evil

[Allah Real]
The other night when were tight
We never knew the answers and making it right
You showed me love, and to my suprise
I open up my eyes, then I realize

[Chorus: Allah Real]
We told us so, this is how it goes
We told us so, this is how it goes

[Allah Real]
I'm underlying, games, you playing on me
Until you show me just how cold it could be
You told us so, I'm so all alone
I need to keep it til we had to go

[Chorus]

[Allah Real]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do

[Chorus]

[Allah Real]
You gave your cell phone number, cuz we are through
Can't shake this feeling, girl, you know what to do
You did it now, oh, the way to do
I'm gonna let you know I'll always love you
We told us so, I told you so
You told us so, we told us so
Don't you, want to know
I told you so
We told us so, girl, we told us so</pre>
