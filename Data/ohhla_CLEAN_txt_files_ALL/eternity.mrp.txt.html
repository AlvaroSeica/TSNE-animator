This is an invitation for all my thug niggas to come join me
on a journey to the ever lasting ship of eternal life
a place where there's no violence no pain no crime no prisons no ghettos
nothing but sunshine at the end of the road so come with me let's ride

All my thug niggas ride to eternity let's ride nigga let's ride nigga (2X)

[C-Murder]

Nigga back in the days I was afraid of the police 
just another paranoid drugdealer on the streets 
my ghetto hero was above the law I caught a glimpse of a bullet 
that took him down like a south paw uneducated to the game of life
I was hated to the grave but the pen kept my mind right 
a young motherfucker doomed since day one 
shit I'm a fool I'm a ball 'til my time come 
a G to me is like a mil' on the streets I'm a kill just to eat 
and leave my enemies on the concrete they say a soft heart
make a bitch nigga stay alert stay alive that's the code of a thug nigga
I wanna rob and steal but crime pays the bill niggas know I'm real
so my pain is what they feel I'm a rider TRU niggas gone feel me
C-Murder ain't gone die 'til a bitch nigga kill me 

All my thug niggas ride to eternity let's ride nigga let's ride nigga (2X)

[Master P]

How many niggas want to ride with me 
when I'm gone don't my fuckin' soldier cry for me 
I want the nigga that did it to die with me 
and his mama and his brother take a ride with me
cuz I'm a killer (a killer) nigga baller 
servin' up the 3rd ward Cali or New Orla'
nigga like the devil with the motherfuckin' red prints 
fight me like a monkey on top of an elephant
the game got me crazy profecy dazy
this god wasn't ? when a nigga tried to play me
god won't you save me nigga only baby only time could take me
mama why you made me like is like slavey tech-nines and three eighties
homies live in shady pray for your baby my first born replace me
this ghetto might waste me I'm a hunted bitch like ghostly 
it be a nigga close to me that take me 

All my thug niggas ride to eternity let's ride nigga let's ride nigga (4X)

[Mr. Serv-On]

they told me in this life those who start off last a end up first
those who start up first a end up last 
last time I saw a .45 blast a nigga who was last should be doin' 50 years
without parole life is cold but it fair fuck the mayor that coward bastard
ask him durin' his term how many niggas sawt jail cells and found cascidy
place me the plastic when its time to shoot only god will know the truth
what's in a nigga's blood is in his heart 
from the start my pain was irreversable the book on how to kill a nigga
is unwritable my title don't sulitify our right to tell a child how
to live his life or how to stop a man when he beat his wife but if you turn
your back grab your gun we could ride tonight 
and ain't no game as I stroll on
nigga you know this S-E-R-V mister get my ride ON 

All my thug niggas ride to eternity let's ride nigga let's ride nigga (4X)

hahhahaha the media point the finger at me like I'm the bad guy
but its ok just take a good look at me I'm no different then your average
businessman society wants to eliminate me but uh in a few years 
you be wishin' you had another Don like me sincerly yours America's 
nightmare Master P
