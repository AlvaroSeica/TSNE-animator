[Intro: Christbearer]
Yeah, yeah, awww, yeah
Yeah, yeah, awww, yeah
Yeah, yeah, awww, yeah
Yeah, yeah, who am I?

[Chorus 3X: Christbearer]
I be the super star, nigga
Champagne caviar, nigga, chaffeur, fetch a car, nigga
You better be a star, nigga
No matter who you are, nigga, Northstar, nigga

[Christbearer]
You better be a star, nigga
Duma Ashkabar, nigga, young black czar, nigga
Jam and jelly at the jar, nigga
So approach me that's so far, nigga, where the blood pour, nigga
Make 'em all scream "that's our nigga"
You better be a star, nigga, play the guitar, nigga
Bet the celly in the car, nigga
Smoke the cigar, you better be large, nigga

[Meko the Pharaoh]
Meko get all up in ya (in ya)
Stay bending corners in the summer, in the winter
Another winner, with a proper education
You in violation, going against the black nation (nigga)
Multiplications of the world's inflation
Got young kids and old men free basing
I stay adjacent to the word in the streets
Rocking muthafuckas with the Northstar heat
So let me take you on a narrow ass language
Some caught flame cuz they couldn't change the game
Cuz shit gets strange in the street
I'm a Long Beach nigga, with Long Beach heat

[Chorus 3X]

[Midnight]
I got a, groove with the demo, I done, wrote in the memo
I done, fucked with Jay Leno, I done, fucked bad hoes
I done, done the shows, I done, done the crimes
I done, done the time, I done, sip the wine
I done, fucked the dimes, I done, toke the nine
She came tail along with song, by the way you flood the call
Better up in the club, he know I'm buying out the bar
Eating the finest foods like caviar, but still a street star
Fly TV's in the whip, fly TV bitches on my dick
And I ain't gotta spit, they know what I'm chirping with
Yo, I'm a super, super, star, bitch

[Coco]
We at the bar, so fuck who you are
And pull toasters, stand a toast at the bar
Our reputation is incomparable, match the scar
That's for all, something nice and all, getting the mic from moss
Ain't enough bitches in the world could fuck me
Ain't enough lips in the world can suck me
Ain't enough drunks, trust me, in this crystal game
My sister seen the pricest things and icey rings
And delight the scene, only write, what I've seen
Regardless what I seen, the hardest dream
Muthafuckas wanna bite you from your center thing
That's why I bring the sticky hen, that hangs up a chinky man
Sun glasses wanna train on dime piece asses
Fuck partying, a lot of crashes
I'm back in pulling guns out of stashes
You can't splash on the splashes...</pre>
