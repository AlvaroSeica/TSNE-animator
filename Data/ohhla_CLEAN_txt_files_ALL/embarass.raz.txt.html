[Intro: Killah Priest (Hell Razah)]
Uh-huh.. what? Yo..
What makes ya so real? No doubt (Goin' through the same motions)
Match my skills.. Killah Priest the Iron Shiek
That you can't feel.. (Messin' with the real)
Champion.. just a little bit embarassed (a little bit embarassed)
Mathematics.. you can't feel.. automatics
A little bit embarassed (a little bit embarassed)
Yo we come down like this..

[Killah Priest]
I choose to live like a fugitive, doin' bids
With grown niggas screwin' kids, make 'em wear wigs
Take up cigarettes, niggas' vexed
I'm holdin' Tec's for you soldier vets
Hittin' shoulders, chests
Rest in peace, tear ya vest to pieces
I show no sweat on the weakness
I'm a threat to preachers, check my features
Killah Priest! I make the blood spill and leak
Ya still a skeet, we reveal the meat
I'm a jungle beast, if ya feel the beat.. feelin' me
Skills are deep, far beneath the concrete
Concepts beyond the steps of zero
Rap hero, kill shows-- ya dead and give it up to the feds

[Chorus: Killah Priest (Hell Razah)]
Can't you feel? (Can't you feel)
That you can't feel (That you can't feel)
A little bit embarassed (A little bit embarassed)
A little bit embarassed (You will get embarassed)
What makes you feel.. (What makes you feel..)
that you can match my skills? (Tryin' to match my skills)
You'll be (you'll just be) a little bit embarassed
(A little bit embarassed) Straight torture
(Gotta straight torture ya) Straight torture
(Gotta straight torture ya)

[Dreddy Kruger (Hell Razah)]
Take ya lights out (Drag 'em in the temple)
Torture ya (Pour lava on his brain)

[Dreddy Kruger]
I can't see a thing, but I hear a mouse piss on cotton
My style is rotten, spoiled by vets who Protect they Neck
Do the knowledge to the mathematical slang that's handsome
Funny hot dogs get played at the speed of fast forward
For comin toward me with that bullshit, I'm from Bushwick
718, get it straight

[Hell Razah]
In New York state, he grew up wild as a juvenile, a young criminal
Save the leftovers to buy a gun to take shit over
What? Hustle 'til we sober again
A soldier within, closer than skin (What?)
Ya face from my .38 slim, turn ya lights dim
Bodies trim, chalk, Brooklyn, New York
Nuff said, the rest'll be spoken by the lead
Aimed at ya big head with nuttin' in it, robbed his lieutenant

[Chorus 2: Killah Priest (Hell Razah)]
You can't feel.. a little bit embarassed (a little bit embarassed)
A little bit embarassed (cuz ya still get in carriage)
Don't you feel.. (don't you feel)
Tryin' to step to the real (tryin' to step to the real)
A little bit embarassed (just a little bit embarassed)
A little bit embarassed (You get robbed for ya karets)

[Prodigal Sunn]
I used to chill with Shaquille and Talil, ill out in Brownsville
Robbing everything walking and breathing up in Cypress Hill
Skillful criminals kept automatics and gadgets
And any tragic, day and night, they reign, tragic
Caught up in the wombs of Brooklyn
Disgusted, cold blooded, the block flooded
Jake robbin niggas for their budget
Him and his sons on the run, sellin drums and guns
Havin fun, becomin well known for packin chrome
In '86, shackin up with this bitch
Him and his click, 1 and 6, stackin cheddar like bricks
But as time flew, they caught a soldier on the Avenue
Eternal revenues lead Jakes to Langston Hughes
Raped his moms lab, they got the tab and was that crab nigga Jab?
Send a stab to wrath there, he ate a bloodbath
They found his corpse up in B-Boy Projects
No objects, no suspects, holey vest with a broken neck
Another case of homicide, unsolved
He should've known to never get involved with the bra he lost it all

[Outro: Dreddy Kruger (Hell Razah)]
YouknowI'msayin? (Yeah) Born-God
(Messin' with the real.. fuck around and get embarassed)
You don't wanna test our skill (KnowI'msayin?
That's how we do it, Mathematics..) Sunz of Man
(It's goin' down like this, everyday same shit
KnowI'msayin? Just change when we make it change
Word up.. you will feel.. you will feel.. a little bit embarassed
A little bit embarassed) A little fuckin' bit (get robbed for ya karets)
(you will feel.. you will feel.. a little bit embarassed)
A little fuckin' bit (a little bit embarassed) A little fuckin' bit
(Get robbed for ya karets
you will feel.. you will feel.. a little bit embarassed
Messin' with the real.. get robbed for ya karets
And we out..)</pre>
