instant, move before you blink
dipped in black in, hand chucks
never make a move with ought your hands up
dominate, enemies grow on you like cancer
there's always more than one answer, take your chances, survival
everythign you do is irreversible, the only law is universal
never break the circle, I'm a master, I think faster
and slide past ya, by all means avoid capture
I adapt to any setting if I have to for what im after
I can be a good actor or a dope rapper
too many choices, slow down, I smell poison
and hear voices, footsteps and slight noises
I move toward, or I record it, I approach
I calculate every step, crept and slit its throat
cracked the diamond safe, hit the fire escape
jetted down the alley way withought a trace

I pick the locks to any box you toss me in
I'll beat anything you charge me with
its gods gift, paid homage
streets follow me, I speak honestly
spread the word for the unheard until they acknowledge me
well connected, I can get the dogs called off of me
I'm something like the modern day socrates
I formulate original philosophies
I think further, go on and create the unheard of
my thoughts pace casing the truth
sometimes, things I say with ought proof
influences you, its pulling you through
have you doing things you didn't think you can do
lets see how long it takes you to

I'M HARD TO GET NEXT TO, I TEST YOU</pre>
