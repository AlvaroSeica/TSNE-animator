[DJ]
Right about now we got a group coming out, it's my personal favorite.
These cats have the hottest selling 8-track of all times.
Please, if you will, put your hands together
For Mr. Dick M. Down and 10 K.A.N.'s.

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, let me hear you say it
Hey ho! Say what, Hey ho! Say what
Can a nigga get some to go (Yeah a little louder)
Hey ho! Here we go
Hey ho! Say what
Can a nigga get some to go (Yeah, come on a little louder)
Hey ho! Here we go
Hey ho! Come on now
Can a nigga get some to go (Yeah baby)
Hey ho! Come on
Hey ho! Say what
Can a nigga get some to go (Uh check it out)
You need dick in your life (Uh come on)
You need dick in your life (That's what you need girl)
Dick in your life (Hey fellas what they need?)
Dick in your life (Uh break it dow)
And you need some dick x4
You need dick in your life (All the fellas)
Dick in your life (Check it out)

[Verse One]
Shut up and jump in your Geo Storm
Cause you ain't going home till the early morn
See tonight you and your friends
Is coming with me to the Comfort Inn
Yeah we done talked but we can't make love
In the middle of the smoke filled clubs
So give me a dub for your half on the room
And a buck 0-5 for your half on the Boone's
So as soon as you get your friends
I'm pulling out the keys to the Benz
And speeding down the middle of the street
So we can go skeet up the sheets
So basically to sum up my order
I'll take your 18 year old daughter
Along with some water
But don't set the table though
Cause I want my order to go

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I know you understand just what I mean
Cause you and your friends aint nothing but fiends
So don't be trying to act fake
Shut up and pass me the R. Kelly tape
Cause one we going to the room of fun
For a nice 68 and I'll owe you one
Don't looked surprised I'm letting you know
That I like my order to go
Really though

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hey red, hey red
Can a nigga get some head
Hey black, hey black
Can a nigga dick you down from the back
Hey red, hey red
Can a nigga get some head
Hey black, hey black
Can a nigga dick you down from the back

[Chorus repeated with ad-libs x5]</pre>
