[Verse 1]
Hey yo mate ya better tell ya baby cakes
that we all make mistakes or she's gonna hate you!
All these promises and not a lotta breakthroughs
I can tell you now that I've paid dues
And played moves that caved through, left shattered when I came to
I never hung out with a fake crew
Give me a stage to fall off, while tryin to call shots
Give me a stomache full of some small knots
Early morning doorknocks, now I'm pissed off
Not really, who here can hear me clearly?
I'm gonna need a show of hands, I've got that toe jam funk
You punks don't wanna smell my popper stopper
It represents the takes it takes to make it proper
Give me ya knockers in exchange for my boxers
Not the best of trades, but I'll infect ya brain
Give me a train from Eltham to inner city Melbourne
Give me some urban decay, can't escape the escapade of get some change
At least there's effort displayed, forget the sway
I'm yet to say something other than piss dribble
Girl I'll make ya lips tickle, give me a mic and I might make ya hips wriggle
Tingle down the spine I'm playing with a racing mind
Give me some paper and a pen and let them bind
Nah fuck it just gimme your mic

[Chorus] {2X}
'Cause a lot of these rappers keep sayin the same shit
Ain't a fuckin thing I can do to change this
It's all good coz I know I'm gonna get mine
We'll work the struggle and hustle to get by
...Nah fuck it just gimme ya mic

[Verse 2]
Give me some duct tape, so I can stick it to your fuck face
The names Muphin not cupcake
Give me a lunchbreak, with a love hate combo
Give me a mundane Monday and a better tommorow
Give me some sunrays and a ticket to the lotto
I'm not tough mate, but I don't sunbake or sip strongbows
I can tell you right now this is how the song goes
Give me a reason I need to justify
why I choose to butterfly through these rough tides
And sometimes I get real amped
yeah my girl wears the pants but you can borrow my shoes
Give me a second chance to let em dance the feud
I'm a spill the can and let I flow loose
So youse can see the whole landscape I navigate through hidden caves
Give it a break
Once in a while sundial keeps movin
and I'll keep pursuin what in turn I could be losin
I'm a half deaf mutant, shootin out these soundwaves
Downplayed from Westfield to fountain gate
Give me that last drop, this week it's my turn to finish the cask off
Give me the start stop blast off, nah gimme that mic
I said gimme that mic, you better gimme that fuckin mic

[Chorus]</pre>
