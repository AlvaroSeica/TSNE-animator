Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Ten for my ring
Fifteen for my chains
Ten for my ring
Fifteen for my chains
Ten ain't shit, I just spent 20 on your main
Ten plus ten, I need 20 M's
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, woah

[Chorus]
Ten plus ten, I need 20 of them
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, I need 20 M's
Ten plus ten, spent that on your bitch and them
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten
Ten plus ten, ten plus ten

[Verse 1]
Got a 2010 Mazi with the Forges on that bitch (No you don't!)
Got a 2010 Mazi with the Forges on that bitch (No you don't!)
Got a 2010 Mazi with the Forges on that bitch (No you don't!)
Took that breitling bentley then I wrapped it round my wrist
Young rich nigga shit, hopped out on your bitch!
Whip, whip, whip the dope so hard I broke my wrist
Want Migos to do a show, it's gon' be 20 M's
How the hell, it's 20 M's and it ain't even 20 of them?
It's some 'migos in the club, I ain't even seen walk in with them
Where they came from? Rica, all the cartels, I'm plugged in with them

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ten for my ring, fifteen for my chains
Ten ain't shit, I just spent 20 on your main, your bitch
Ten for my ring, fifteen for my chains
Ten ain't shit, I just spent 20 on your main, your bitch
Young rich nigga need a young rich bitch
Kept me on the north side with the Migos juugin' bricks
Them [?], they call me 600, young nigga [?] somethin'
Hatchoo, that ten ain't nothin', we in the hundred grand juug gettin' [?]
My Migos, nigga, they can't stop juugin', I put that on my mama
Think I'm a sweet lip, fuck around and get hit, [?] llama

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ten plus ten, [?]
Stuffed in my Balenciaga jeans, number one stunna
Don't call yo bitch ten, shoot yo bitch a ten
Turn her to cocaine runner for the Mexican
[?] Quavo, Guapo, Takeoff, shoot you ten
For every red truck that you back in, [?]
Tryna get PeeWee Longway to walk in
And I'm GK a hundred man strappin'
Ten, ten, ten, got racks, Longway, big face Benjamin, what can you say?
That bitch in my face, she just started my way
I [?] I take off her face
Longway you switcharoo ten different races
Speakin' no Inglo, put ten in their face
Smokin' on indo I got from the Bay
Fuckin' [?] then can I stay?
[?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I just fucked your bitch and I ain't give that ho shit
I just fucked your bitch and I ain't give that ho shit
Fuck all you cockroaches, I'm on my Scarface shit, Tony!
I just fucked your bitch and I ain't give that ho shit
Fuck all you cockroaches, I'm on my Scarface shit, Tony!
It's levels to this shit, I'm on my Meek Mill shit, Meek Milly!
Ten plus ten, that's a dub, you dumb bitch
A hundred band juug, young nigga had to snatch it
All my bitches bad but I still fuck with the ratchets
Draped up in designer, everything European
Big blunts of weed, big cups of lean
Y'all ain't even see me comin', choppa with the beam
Trap jumpin' out the gym like a trampoline
Fuck you mean? Jordan 3 for the whole team
We not the gold gang, but our neck covered in gold chains

[Chorus]</pre>
