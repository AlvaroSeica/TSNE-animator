[Verse]
Two years, eight months, three weeks, eleven days
Twenty-seven minutes, forty seconds since heaven gave
Me a reason for breathin'
Remember when our daughter grew her teeth in?
Me and you, we used to stay up
Late nights, play fights
Pillow-fightin', "Thriller" Michael Jackson
Was our jam, now our love is so surreal, it's frightenin'
...I knew that somethin' was strange
When I got the voice mail sayin' 'Danny, you changed'
How did I change?  I know that I don't call as much as I'd like to
But baby girl I wanna spend my life with you
It's bad enough my friends are sayin' the same thing
I figure this is one of the ills that fame brings
Besides, I Western Union you two times a week
And I gotta be doin' somethin' right by buying that Jeep
For your moms, sometimes I wish the price for trying was cheap
So tell me what do I do now?
I got a beep, hold on
