Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
What would I do if you came back into my life
Would I take you in or simply pass you by
I've got a life
I just can't through away because of you
I might just wanna keep you by my side
I might just wanna keep you in my life

What would I do if I seen you again
It's been a long time since my eyes meet
Yours and mine
I keep on bleeding for you
I must admit it
But I have made up my life
So I stick with it
I found a good man who loves my just the same
And a couple little kids
Who use mom to call my name
I don't have time just to run off
With a lost love
How irresponsible of me
If I would walk off
I'm just so scared if I seen
You again and that
My heart will start beating for you
Just like it did then

When everything was so good
Between you and me
When you were my man
And I was your girl you
Promise the world
Me prometiste el mundo
I was on a cloud
Now I'm fallin fallin
Down
Y ahora estoy a solas sin ti

[Chorus]
What would I do if you came back into my life
Would I take you in or simply pass you by
I've got a life
I just can't through away because of you
I might just wanna keep you by my side
I might just wanna keep you in my life

I can't deny that a part of me would
Really wanna see you
Do you ever think of me
Even only just a little
Who you been with
Are you already married
Do you have kids
Is your life settled like mine is

I don't know but another part
Just wants away
To never see you again and keep it that way
So you would never
Make me weak in the knees
I beg of you please
Don't make me start to reminisce
All those time
That I let myself be fooled by you
My love is true
This is were I promise you and I
Believe it all
Confava en ti

Foolish of me for makin you my all
But will I still love you
When we both meet again
If you knock at my door
Would I let you come in
Lloran mis ojos

[Chorus]
What would I do if you came back into my life
Would I take you in or simply pass you by
I've got a life
I just can't through away because of you
I might just wanna keep you by my side
I might just wanna keep you in my life

What would I do if you came back into my life
Would I take you in or simply pass you by
I've got a life
I just can't through away because of you
I might just wanna keep you by my side</pre>
