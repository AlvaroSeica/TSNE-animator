[Verse One]
Yo it's Friday night, and ain't nothin to do
Think I'll check out the show where the flavor is true
From 12 to 2, they provide for you
And bless the airwaves with the vibe that's new
Yo Soul, check the levels is it comin in clear?
Well get your tape ready cause the hour is near
Sound Providers are here, time to bless the sphere
This the Choc with the Friday night world premiere
Stand clear cause we're takin you back to the day
To a time when the MC had somethin to say
There was radio play, and the people would say
"God damn that DJ made my day"

[Verse Two]
Independent, or major, as long as there's flavor
Joints get rocked, when my man Choc
gives the command on the FM band
The crates arrive, and the tables are manned
By a street magician, movin the pitch and
gettin mad busy on a musical mission
The streets are listenin, the flavor's on time
We shine, with the Friday night rhyme
At midnight, the request lines are lit up
Choc is on the mic, askin all of y'all to get up
out of your chair and throw your hands in the air
Scoopin up props from Watts to Bel Air
It's like that
