"Drunken Master, nigga
Yeah- Wha-wha-wha!
Got what 'chu want
Got what 'chu need
Blaze the weed
We can ride
What's yo' name?
Check it out now"

Drunken Master, nigga- Once again on the grind
Tryin' to find me a spot in the shade and call it mine
If them niggas wanna bring it, best believe I'm the first
to get to thumpin' on they ass and put them hoes in a hearse
Drunken Master, nigga- Once again on the grind
Tryin' to find me a spot in the shade and call it mine
If them niggas wanna bring it, best believe I'm the first
to get to thumpin' on they ass and put them hoes in a hearse

Yo, it's three o'clock in the mornin', I'm dressed in all black
Me and my nigga Jake in the sixty-seven Cadallac
Chrome kit and tinted windows, the whole nine
Lookin' for some hoes to find- It's goin' down,
got the hennessey and Coke on ice in the trunk,
Kev Money in the back seat rollin' up the blunt
It's the first of the month so you know the routine
Pockets on swoll from out there servin' fiends
wit' my team- We hit Ninety-four West
Smif on my hip, vest on my chest
Crackin' jokes wit' my folks 'bout the days of being broke
Now I'm ridin' spokes, chokin' off the weed smoke
I graduated from the days of gangbangin'
to straight ballin', hustlin' and thang slangin'
Nuts hangin', 'bout ready to scrape.
On the paper chase catchin' mad weight from out of state
Politicin' wit' them B-T-T's,
real niggas makin' G's wit' they mind on they chedda cheese
P-C-C's, Professional Chedda Chasers
wit' Dre The Drunken Master, blastin' on these playa haters

Drunken Master, nigga- Once again on the grind
Tryin' to find me a spot in the shade and call it mine
If them niggas wanna bring it, best believe I'm the first
to get to thumpin' on they ass and put them hoes in a hearse
Drunken Master, nigga- Once again on the grind
Tryin' to find me a spot in the shade and call it mine
If them niggas wanna bring it, best believe I'm the first
to get to thumpin' on they ass and put them hoes in a hearse

"Nigga, what?! Uh-uh!"</pre>
