Song:   On My Way
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

And I'll be on my way
And I'll be on my way
And I'll be on my way
And I'll be on my wa-ay

And I'll be on my way
And I'll be on my way
And I'll be on my way
And I'll be on my wa-ay

Look, I'm a give you a tip
Never let nobody tell you what you can be
They told me I couldn't
But I bet they told Obama he couldn't be the president either

On my way
On my way
Road to the riches 100 miles an hour
Tryna make it to the top from the bottom
On my way
On my way
On my way
I see them fans, everywhere I go I spot 'em
Nigga, leave with me so you know I got 'em
On my way

I look in the mirror
What do I see?
Like the letter after A, I'm all I could be
Bein' a winner, that's all I could see
Give me the ball, bet I score, on all of they D
Winnin' the bet, I was rain and fallin' asleep
I had to slit it 50/50, not all in the streets
Whether reppin' and treppin'
Whether treppin' and reppin'
I was makin' it happin with dreams of makin' it rappin
I was makin' some magic like some magician and rabbit
My position was havic but I insisted I had it
I insisted I'd get it for me, my mom and my sister
Hustlin' grindin' and winnin'
And it's just the beginnin'

On my way
On my way
On my way
Road to the riches 100 miles an hour
Tryna make it to the top from the bottom
On my way
On my way
On my way
I see them fans, everywhere I go I spot 'em
Nigga, leave with me so you know I got 'em
On my way

I had a basketball dream they deflated
I wasn't good as Michael Jordan so they faded
God do me my hand and I displayed it
Gave me a king of diamonds, I flip me a ace of spades
And that's blackjack and bed scraps
Soon to be the great as I sat back attack that
Did it for the haters
Man, I did it like the Lakers
Kobe and Phil Jackson
I'm independent as ever, them labels is still askin'
I didn't believe they believed in me
Cause where I'm from they all believed with me
So this the song I say
Yea, I be on my way
Yea, I be

On my way
On my way
Road to the riches 100 miles per hour
Tryna make it to the top from the bottom
On my way
On my way
On my way
I see them fans, everywhere I go I spot 'em
Nigga, leave with me so you know I got 'em
On my way

On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way</pre>
