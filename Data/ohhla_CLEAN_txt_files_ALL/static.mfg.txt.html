[Chorus]
Don't want no static in my life
Don't need no static in my life
Don't want no static in my life
I don't want it, I don't need it
Don't want no static in my life
Don't need no static in my life
Don't want no static in my life
I don't want it, I don't need it

[Verse 1]
I want to enter back in Heaven, so I'm on my knees
Talking to creator, frantic crying, begging please
Forgive me for the things I've done, forgive my enemies
War was just a game to us, excuse us for our arrogance
See back and forth a game of death, we took each other's lives
Beef lasts forever, devil plotting my demise
Thought we kept it real, but the life we led was lies
With heart and soul I do repent, I acknowledge it was ignorance

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Respect for human life, like rebel angels we had none
Spilling sacred blood and let it dry up in the sun
Forgive my enemies, forgive me for the things I've done
War was just a game to us, excuse us for our arrogance
Casualties in war process many brothers slain
Hands and knees in dirt, I try to dig them out they graves
Change my way of thinking, maybe babies I can save
With heart and soul I do repent, I acknowledge it was ignorance

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Day we clap with chrome, night we clap with black
From the sun to the moon, wigs got pushed back
From the womb to the tomb, yeah we bust our guns
When one of us die, then our mothers cry
One thing we learned, from the wars in history
Is that man is mans' reason for mans' misery
Make sure the children are not in the sequel
Escape this evil, educate the people
By teaching the babies, enhance they minds
And let them know, leave the streets behind
Build a better world, watch mistakes we made
That we're sisters and brothers regardless of our color, love each other
Streets are ruthless, no hesitation they'll shoot ya
Gun smoke so thick, that they can't see they future
We are all God's creatures, and we're made magnificent
Divide and conquer, but together we can make a difference
Static (Don't need it)
Static (Don't need it)
It's time to make a change
Static
Static
Teach the babies man
