[B Real]
Can I live, who willin to give me applause?
Half note, gotta get mine and open the doors
I want a FAT crib, on the hill, after my cause
I need a fine woman, cuz I ain't fuckin wit yours
Can I live? I wanna take care of my fam
All the haters can't bait us, they don't know who I am
You gonna learn soon baby, when my heat'll expand
When I slay suckers everytime, I foil the plan
Can I live? Why not? I'm makin it hot
Like the rubber gets when I start rockin the spot
DAMN! She gotta have it in the parkin lot
Better come get her cuz she's still in my knot
Can I live? Get your hand out of my pockets
I'm buck-nutty, tear your arms out of the sockets
People wanna talk no matter how much I rock it
Pull my dick out, run about for niggas who jock it
Can I live? -- Can I live?
