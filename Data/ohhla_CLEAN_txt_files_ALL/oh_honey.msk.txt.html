Typed by: AZ Lyrics

your always trippin on tha things that I do nd where I'm goin
that you heard this nd that from tha rukas de tus homies
que me vieron with my homegirls en la calle
now who the fuck dey think dey become all of a sudden?
can't you see there just jealous cause your with me and
they can't stand lookin at you kiss me. you blame it on me cause you don't
understand it nd why I'm always tryin to keep you from it
but then again you turn around with sum new things sayin that I'm
actin shady that's what you think you never ask 4 my side of the story
always expecting 4 me to b sorry but hell na I'm getting tierd of tha bullshit
u believe her more then me ain't no new shit I always knew that this was gona happen
since tha day that we started all these putas started talkin

so why you follow me around all tha time you better calm down cause I ain't messin with your mind
don't trip I ain't doin nada malo you must be seein things no I ain't with another vato
so don't believe eveything that they tell you it's all a bunch of lies if it was true I would of
left you

you always find a reason to say that I was messin you even have tha fuckin balls 2
check me while I'm dressin lookin at my titts feelin on my clit checkin on my ass tryin 2
c how I react but I never once acted the way you expected tryin to catch hickeys on

And all my homegirls r tellin me that I should drop you that your a pain in tha ass when there around u
