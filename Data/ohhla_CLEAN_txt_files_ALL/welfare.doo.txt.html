Hey baby
This the one Dr. Dooom
Still love you cause you ain't plastic
Makin them peanut butter sandwiches
Babies cryin, runnin around with dirty diapers
The way you used to make the Kool-Aid
with the weave all in your hair
Even some droppin down in my soup
I could excuse that..

	It's Welfare Love, section eight! (4X)

Girl we been through a lot
Every season I used to bug you out on the couch
For different reasons, you thought I was crazy
Catchin a Greyhound bus down South
Collectin lightning bugs and bring a dead mouse in the house
Holdin a fortune with a jar of termites
I used to blast the Delphonics in a glowing room with black lights
Colt 45 had me sportin a wig like Billy Dee
I was a Melle Mel fan, always bumpin Run-D.M.C.
We stuck together when one of my parakeets died
You broke down and cried, for the love of animals
I used to always cut the legs off a roach
See if he'll stay there on a piece of tissue
and give him a piece of toast
That morning, he would wake up and be gone
What, the insect had a ambulance?
As a little boy eatin ice cream in the cold project apartment
I used to see rats dance, my aunt used to lay down the poison
and say, "Y'all makin too much noise and.."
(Too much noise and.. oh, too much!)

Grabbing crackers out the 'fridgerator
I was a terrible masturbator
I was looking at Black Tail and Penthouse
since I was in a incubator
With Similak aimin my bottle at a fine nurse's ass-crack
It was a pleasure to collect ants
Havin em in my Billy the Kid pants
Allergic to chocolate, chewin Oreo's and I couldn't stop it
I remember the days when King Vitamin was in the supermarket
Kool-Aid was syrupy, my mom used to make it real slurpy
Don't believe in Santa Claus
They had a dope peacoat filled with mothballs
Lint everywhere, with UTZ chips livin deboinairre
Fly girls with onion rings on the staircase
I had Pro Keds with Lee suits
Always used to stare in your face
Take you on the roof, check out my pigeon coop
Dressed up like Dracula
Eatin a slice of pizza on your stoop
Neighbors knew I was a nerdy
On the Bronx streets I was 7:30
Girls you was infatuated with my quarter fill
(Hey baby, check this out)

Yeah..		 		it's welfare love
You look so beautiful baby..	welfare love
With your long hair..		welfare love
The way you got it DONE..	
Sewed in..			welfare love
Babies walkin around cryin..	section eight, section eight
Food all over the floor..
The kitchen sink, messed up..	wel-fare love!
It's that old ghetto smell
in the house..
People comin over to bottow sugar
That's the way I like it
Cereal all over the floor</pre>
