Song:   I'm Wrong, But You Ain't Right
Typed by: timmy.bogenburt@gmail.com

Breaking the silence is the hardest thing in life
Knowin' that you're wrong, feelin' like you can't go on
I've been a victim so many times
But I'm man enough to know when I'm wrong

With the fresh cut mullets, back row in sight
Pass the packed bullet, I'm gonna rock all night
Uptight right wingers, tryin' to say I'm what
But I'm a flight bound singer not giving a fuck
Hard luck of the devil with the grace of God
On a level of Oz, and it makes you nod
With the body of a sinner, mind of a saint
I'm everything you love, everything you hate
Hit a lot of curves, hard roads and hills
Got nerves of steel, and watched time stand still
It took too long, but I stood my height
You can say I'm wrong, but you ain't right

You ain't right, you, you, you ain't right
You ain't right, right
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right

You can save the environment with all your wit
But can you save your children from a world of bullshit
You look at me with a loss for love
But if you took me out would your kid still do drugs
You wanna point your finger in the unclear
You wanna point your finger in the unclear
You wanna point your finger in the unclear
You ought to point your finger in the mirror
You wanna trip, quit, cause I'm a keep rippin'
You can bitch but the strippers gon' keep strippin'
I'm singing songs in the key of life
And you can say I'm wrong but you ain't right

You ain't right, you, you, you ain't right
You ain't right

We just can't do, come on now, right
Rock on
Cowboy baby, cowboy baby

You ain't right
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right
You, you, you ain't right
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right
You ain't, you ain't, you ain't, right</pre>
