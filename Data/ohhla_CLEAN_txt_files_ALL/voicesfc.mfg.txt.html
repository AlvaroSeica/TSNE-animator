[Grimm, Verse 1]
Number one's disrespectful, got the audacity
Inside my head lay in bed watch TV
Jenny Jones, Jerry Springer, whole day eat and sleep
That one will never get anywhere, he's lazy
Number two between me and you deal with afterlife witchcraft
Anytime he can make them pay they gonna feel his wrath
He talks about chopping people up and start to laugh
That one right there ain't stable, he's crazy
Number three, if you ask me, really needs some help
Every time he feels alone he wants to go and kill himself
Very closed minded, don't see eye to eye with Percy
Cause Percy think that shit is weak and don't show him no mercy
He can find a state of bliss if he really tried
He's not happy on the planet and don't know really why
All he seem to know is that he really wants to die
That's so sad, so pitiful he's miserable
Damn

[Chorus]
Voices, they're living inside my head
Voices, they're living inside my head
Voices, they're living inside my head
Voices, they're living inside my head
Voices, they're living inside my head
Voices, they're living inside my head
Voices, they're living inside my head
It's fucked up, cause rent, they don't pay me

[Verse 2]
Number four's ready for war by all means necessary
Nat Turner, Huey Newton yes he study revolutionary ideologies
Blow up precincts no apologies
Now, that nigga, right there, he's dangerous
Number five need to act alive, strive use potential
Cause if he stays in purgatory it is consequential
He's going against the reason why the creator even sent him
He's too scared to rise up and be famous
Number six wanna flip these bricks, that's right move these pies
Have the flyest clothes and rides that money can buy
Smell the coffee stupid, you are part of genocide
That's fucked up, please stop and save the babies
Number seven found his heaven while on Earth you see
He's about loyalty and also family
His goal is to get with his twin and have some babies
Now, that one right there, I feel him

[Chorus]

They all want my attention while I sing this song
Bouncing back and forth like ping and pong
Temporary stay, ended up long
It's fucked up, cause rent, they don't pay me
They all want my attention while I sing this song
Bouncing back and forth like ping and pong
Temporary stay, ended up long
It's fucked up, cause rent, they don't pay me
