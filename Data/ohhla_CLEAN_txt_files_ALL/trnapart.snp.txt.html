[Verse One: Rita Ora]
I heard him speak but then I saw his f-a-ce
I knew he was the one because I dreamt this day (I dreamt this day)
I was such a beginner on this thang called l-o-ve (Budda bye bye!!!)
And now he's goin away, and now, I'm torn apart, so torn, ap-a-rt

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
You one of them (HEY!) You see me swear (HEY!)
You pullin triggers let you slide another day (HEY!)
Say goodbye too, the one that got away!!!

[Verse Two: Snoop Lion] (Rita Ora)
Her lips was the very first thing that I sa-aw-aw-aw-aw
She flew like an angel when that made me want her more (Want her more!)
My reputation says I'm there for l-o-ve (Buddy bye bong bong!)
And now she's gone away, and now I'm so torn apart, so torn apart

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
You one of them (HEY!) You see me swear (HEY!)
You pullin triggers let you slide another day (HEY!)
Say goodbye too, the one that got away!!!

[Bridge: Snoop Lion]
Never let you get her but you shouldn't let her got away
Get away, got away, gotta find another way
Never let her get away, gotta find a way to stay
Never let her get away, never let her get away

[Rita Ora]:
You never let her go, you never let her go, you feel sorry?

[Snoop Lion] (Rita Ora)
You see me? (You see me) You hear me? (Yeah) HEY! HEY!

[Rita Ora]:
Yeah! Buddy bang bang bang! Buddy bang bang bang!
Bye! HEY!

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
You one of them (HEY!) You see me swear (HEY!)
You pullin triggers let you slide another day (HEY!)
Say goodbye too, the one that got away!!!

[Outro: Rita Ora]
Yeah! Um! Um! Um! Buddy bang bang bang! Buddy bang bang bang!
Buddy bye bye! Yeah! Oooh!
I say goodbye to! Yeah!
