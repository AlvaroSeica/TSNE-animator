[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Ayo fam, Let me tell you about this Queen I seen the other day
Yo, She was lookin just as fine as the weather, You know
I aint even stop to get her name
I was just blinded like lookin directly in the sun
It's like even now I can't get her off my mind yo, For real

[Inspectah Deck]
She a Queen like Liz the third
Amazon body frame, Born hood though she live in the burbs
The type to have any man, Get em to splurge
On her worst day still rockin linens and furs
Word, Lord knows your bad
Your rose colored Jag match wit your lips, Toes and bag
Yo it's everything the goals you have
Your pose, Your stance, You have a nigga like "Woah" on glance
I'm intrigued by your beautiful frame
And I admit I was kinda hesitant to ask you what's your name
Babe, How you doin today
She looked me in the eye said fine, Hope your doin the same
And with the breeze she just blow on her way
I'm usually too cool but only a fool would let you stray

(Pardon me sweetheart, Let me have a moment of your time)

Yo, Mommy's more then dime
I often find she winds up on my mind all the time
Like her favorite song, My eyes laid upon true love'n
When she first came along, Until we meet again
Just keep me in your thoughts, I'm your rock
If you ever need a friend, And them
Other chicks, Aint no need for them
I aint blinded by lust, Trust me I see a gem
I'm just hope'n I can make you mine
Just take your time and let the words penetrate your mind
I'm the wind that's beneath your wings
Be real with everything, Let me show you that I can be your King
I thought I saw you last night in the club with your crew
I called your name so ashamed when it wasn't you

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
Damn, You can't win em all
It's like Erykah Badu said baby
I guess I'll see you next life time
I'll keep you in my dreams though</pre>
