[Tekitha]
It's been so long...
Since he had a true friend
True friends, are sure hard to come by
And then again, his loyalties, I avenge
Always carries his head to the sky

[Chorus: Tekitha]
And they can't see... no, no
They can't see him walking through the darkness, no, no
No, they can't see him walking through the darkness, no
No, they can't see him walking through the darkness

[Tekitha]
Day after day, and night after night
He's hustlin, just to get it right
There's no.. on earth faith
No war without his...
The music's tight, his just to fight

[Chorus]

[Tekitha]
Now, in the end, fate it's place
On his road to become.. become him
They chased and gave haste
But failed to eliminate
Challenged his state of grace
And sealed his faith...

[Chorus]

[Samurai Code sample by Camille Winbush]
and when Tommy got to earien
They had a sort of peered lunchbox
They used for a single day
When flower viewin
Upon returnin
They throw them away
Tramplin them under foot
The end is important to all things
