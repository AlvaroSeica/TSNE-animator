Ayy~! Ayy, ayy, umm...
I was taught, to act my shoe size never my age
I always judge a book by the cover never the page
I never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage
that he felt when he dealt with the physiological phase
They say that I never cease to amaze
while half my mental belongs in a cage
The ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch
If you niggaz sellin dope then you sellin my shit
Sellin my assets
I'm so damn illegal that I need to be arrest
But then they'll get my mom for 18 years of possession
She showed me affection
like a drug dealer using her pocket for my protection

[Chorus]
The pigs fly away in the morning
but I ain't get to see you today
And if I want to go outside
I got to make sure that I can play here
I bet you never seen a pig fly {*3X*}
Well you ain't been lookin through my eyes

[Domo Genesis]
I bet you've never seen a pig fly, nope
Right next to the fat lady hittin high notes
Went to sleep at seven, never woke up from the dream
Wear my wings and my jeans but my hat is from Supreme
... So I guess that's where I hide my things
Caged, and the wonder is seen
Middle finger missin so I can not give a fuck
I can hear the bells ringing off the +Nice Dream+ truck
So I'm chasin the dreams, no realities
Hoping that maturity won't be too mad at me
but if so, I'll take the scorn, indeed happily
Long as I can feel my heart tap like +Happy Feet+

[Tyler, the Creator]
Fatherless kids, orphans like me and Domo is
A fuck that we will never give is like our pops
but what we did was found our niche and made a stitch
just like a shirt, that's why our stains smell like the shit
That's from

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And my circus is all night (don't go home tonight)
It's all night (don't go home tonight, chill)
Yeah the shit's all night (don't go home tonight)
And my circus is all night (don't go home tonight)
It's all night (please stay, don't go home tonight)
It's all night (don't go home tonight)

[Tyler, the Creator]
I'm an Odd Fellow, the opposite of mellow
The therapist said hello but my mom would wonder
I was dealin with iller shit like professional plumbers
like food for thought was my father but I ain't have the hunger
My self esteem was like me, tall and full of flaws
My pride is gone, I'm that +Guy+ like Aaron Hall
Shit, I know some niggaz wear their hearts on they sleeves
But I wear mine on my head... Supreme

O.F.
