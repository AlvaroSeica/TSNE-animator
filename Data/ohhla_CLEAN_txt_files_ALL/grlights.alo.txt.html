Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Something special happened today
I got green lights all the way
With no big red sign to stop me
No traffic jam delay

See I was driving over the moon
(Ohh I)
In my big hot air balloon
(Ohhh I)
Floating high into the darkness
(Ohhh I)
I hope I get there soon
(Ohhh I)
It so many things to do
So many people I need to talk to
And they've all been waiting for me
Well I gotta make it through

Something special happened today
I got green lights all the way
With no big red sign to stop me
No traffic jam delay

Thank my stars for air that we breathe
(Ohhh I)
You have no I dead of what it means...no no
(Ohhh I)
To a man whose always traveling
(Ohhh I)
Whose seen the things that I've seen
(Ohhh I)

I don't know what's yet to come
Not sure of anything that I've done
Really makes that much a difference
Well I hope it has for some

Something special happened today
I got green lights all the way
With no big red sign to stop me
No traffic jam delay

Well I was driving over the moon
(Ohhh I)
In my big hot air balloon
(Ohhh I)
Floating high up in the darkness..
(Ohhh I)
I promise that I 'll make it to you very soon
(Ohhh I)
