[Nicki Minaj]
Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could come inside of my playpen
Cause he look like a superstar in the makin
So I think that I'm goin in for the takin
Hear through the grapevine that he cakin
W-w-we could shoot a movie, he could do the tapin
B-b-boom boom pow, this thing be shakin
I ain't even tryin to find out who he datin

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
Cause I know, he got a wife at home
But I need, just one night alone
If you keep, playin them g-g-games
I'ma run away-ay, I'ma run away-ay-ay

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If-if you're lookin for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance
If you want it I'm gonna be va va voom, voom
If you got it you got it, you got that boom, boom
If you want it I'm gonna be va va voom, voom
If you got it you got it, you got that boom, boom

[Nicki Minaj]
Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could become my little problem
Cause he look like he modellin clothes in Dublin
So I think that he gettin that green a goblin
Hear through the grapevine that he hang low
W-w-we could shoot a movie, could bang like Rambo
B-b-boom boom pow, this thing's so bingo
Wonderin if he can understand my lingo

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Boy I'm in this club slow mo
Don't mind if I do (do)...
And I can tell you're feelin me from the jump
I wanna ride too (too)...
You got that hot shit, boy you're blessed
Let me feel up on yo' chest
Flexin, you the man
You the man, one hundred grand
The same ol', game go
Yes I play it everywhere
Come baby lay there, let me stay there
Let me show you how I run t'ing in a playground
Come and get this VA VA VOOM VOOOOOOM~! (WOO-WOO!!)

[Chorus]</pre>
