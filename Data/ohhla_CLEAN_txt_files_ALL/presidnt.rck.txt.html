[Intro]
{*Maybach Music*}
Get money! {*3X*}

[Elijah Blake - over Intro]
Girl I think you're special
Strictly presidential

[Rick Ross]
You know the crib on the water now
The Maybach stay watered down
Project niggaz givin orders now
The gold Presidential just to sport around
I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars
Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walkingon Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling
Happy Chanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling
Got my seats on the wood, players givingme dap
Lyor like how I move, want her right in my lap
I made a few Mills, ain't mentionin Meek
Went and bought a new crib the weekend Wale released
Bitches they keep comin, "Billie Jean" thumpin
I need to hear the trumpets, meanin machine gunnin
I ain't missin nuttin, got her sipping somethin
I could ship her somethin, you know that December comin

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Girls and green, is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream, of royalty (get money)
But that's who we are baby (get money)
All I ever need is girls and green
(Get money)

[Rick Ross]
They see me leanin in some new shit
Now it's gold Presidentials for the crew shit
Threesomes, weed crumbs on the cruise ship
I'm a boss have y' ass on a news clip
She a dime, but she gotta be a cool bitch
Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit
Not a chance, whips got her talkin foolish
I was skippin them classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest
Fishscale made me major profit margins
I'm a profit stuffin my pockets, you niggaz starvin
Lord forgive me for my sins I'm with this pretty bitch
Eighty grand, rubber band for some silly shit
She on that Alexander Wang
Gold Presidential Venus when I change the game

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
She wanna roll with a winner now
So I let her roll with the windows down
My niggaz up the road come and get it now
Sixty/forty know we split it up the middle now
Shorty's said the word, I was talkin that talk
Maybe link up New York, that's awesome as fuck
I never been in love until I heard a beat
She never met a G until she heard of me
Third floor projects, feel my point of view
Everything is number two, that's when it come to you
Isabel Marant sneakers 'til the summer through
Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do
Ugh~! Baby girl got that wet wet
I repeat: wet wet
I'm the boss and I'm on that
(I love you) White teeth, gold Rolex

[Chorus]

[Outro: Rick Ross]
{*Maybach Music*}
Her shoe game remarkable
I feel solely responsible...
I feel solely responsible {*Maybach Music*}</pre>
