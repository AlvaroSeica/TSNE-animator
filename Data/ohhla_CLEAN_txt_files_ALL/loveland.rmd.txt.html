[Remedy]
Now let's take a trip through history
Round the time 3,000 B.C.E.
They asked me to teacher, to bring you the news
Going way way back to the story of the Jews
Many years ago, in the land so sacred
Founded patriachs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
Found and forced the twelve tribes to migrate to Egypt
Unequipped, descendants became slaves quick
After a few centuries, Moses led his people
From bondage to freedom, back to Israel, eventually
Forty years in the desert, deceive the Torah
And chanted five books and the Ten Commandments
Conquered the land, under Joshua's command
Sol and King David working hand in hand
Bishulim named the capital, this is instrumental
David's song Solomon, built the holy temple
For 200 years, it developed and flourished
Observence by the prophets, with wisdom well nourished
Over run by Assyrians, who threatened their lives
The people dispersed, to ten lost tribes
Babylonians conquered and destroyed the temple
Jewish people exiled, no where to be sent to</pre>
