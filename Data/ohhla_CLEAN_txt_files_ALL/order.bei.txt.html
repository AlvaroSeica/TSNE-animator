Song:   Order What U Want
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Get it if she want it

Get it if she want it
Just point out what cha like, baby girl you know I'm on it

My girl get what she want
Ain't nothing she can't have
Blue Valentino shoes
Balenciaga bag
I'm stupid with this cash
I'm foolish with this money
We up in Tiffany's
Goin' crazy
Throwing hundreds
She just brings me whatever she says
She can get it all cause her baby get the dough
Up in Imperial Fez
You ain't never had lamb chops like this before
I ball like a nigga named Eat You Raw
Make it rain
Sweep the floor
Baby there's no limit
You can get it
'Cause I'm wit' it

Order what chu want
I'ma get it if you want it
Just point out what chu like
What chu like
And girl I'm on it
I be in all the stores goin' goin' goin' crazy
Don't matter the price
Nothings too much for my baby
[2x]

My girl get what she want
Right now she wants for nothin'
I put her in that 'Mazi turnin heads
My girl be stuntin'
She don't mind that I'm hustlin
My sexy little somethin'
She got so many clothes
She be dressin'
Call her stuffin'
I got money
(I got money)
Yes I do
(Yes I do)
I make more than yo baby daddy do
(Ayee)
That Gucci she gon' get it
That Prada she don't want it
She on that new sh-
Tell yo girl to get up on it
I swear my baby looks so fly-y-y-y-y
Even girls be starin' when she walk by-y-y-y
That Bebe she gon' get it
That Fendi she don't want it
She on that new sh-
Tell yo girl to get up on it, woah

Order what chu want
I'ma get it if you want it
Just point out what cha like
What cha like
And girl I'm on it
I be in all the stores goin' goin' goin' crazy
Don't matter the price
Nothings too much for my baby
[2x]

Point out what you like
Just tell me, let me know
And what ever it is
We gon' get it
That's fa sho
Just point out what you like
Yeah tell me, let me know
And what ever it is
We gon' get it
That's fa show
Let's go!

Order what chu want
I'ma get it if you want it
Just point out what cha like
What cha like
And girl I'm on it
I be in all the stores goin' goin' goin' crazy
Don't matter the price
Nothings too much for my baby
