Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, new shit same bathroom all my niggas blowin bassoons
I don't even smoke and that's cool, cause I'm takin straight shots harpoon
Ragin, chyea I'm amazin heavy chicks on me asian, caucasian
Lights all on me feelin like I'm raving, chains all on me feelin like I'm slaving
Drinking from a big glass call it D-Cup, go and take a sip and let it creep up
Me and Sammy on the tour bus feet up. Its like girls go wild when they see us
I'm dark night in a black coupe back at it, post up and lay like cravmatic
Party all night that's a bad habit, white girls dissapear with me black magic

I'm Ragin [x2]
Throw your hands up one time if you faded, throw your hands up one time if you wasted
throw your hands up two times if you ragin, throw your hands up two times if you ragin

Lets go, tour bus rolled through bad news we just smokin on some reefer taboo
Twenty cuties down to get it in bag room all dinner suck each one of us vacuums
I'm ragin bitch I'm amazin, smokin on that purple feelin like a raven
Cougars all on me feelin like I'm asian I run the whole country feelin like I'm Reagen
And my girl got ass on D-Cups, straight A's in the face no C plus
Last night we on stage you was kicked off, jager shots to the face no chaser
Dark liquor in a green room gettin faded party all night long
so fuckin wasted 23 years young feelin like I made it, me and B on top I'm grated. Bitch

I'm Ragin [x2]
Throw your hands up one time if you faded, throw your hands up one time if you wasted
throw your hands up two times if you ragin, throw your hands up two times if you ragin

Ok cool back at it. South beach flow hit em with the heat, young dealin hit em with the beat
Ya'lls just stupid I hit em with the leech girls try and bring me back like 'get him to the greek'
Kid maejor's unique, party like a white boy drink like a jeep
Flow on retarted style on ridiculous these girls think my music is the sickest shieet!
Say stay flow hit em with the magic all day I dream about spittin classic
Party hard whole club doin backflips you could be the heat me and B will be the Mavericks
I'm ragin like I never had a drink yo, summertime boyz playin on your ringtone
Beat throwin up Imma catch it in the airzzo, fly over so fast izzopear

I'm Ragin [x2]
Throw your hands up one time if you faded, throw your hands up one time if you wasted
throw your hands up two times if you ragin, throw your hands up two times if you ragin</pre>
