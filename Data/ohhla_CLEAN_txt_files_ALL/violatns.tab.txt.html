[Intro: Talib Kweli]
Aiyyo son, you hear that?
This championship music
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, uh

[Talib Kweli]
Heed the battle call, check the catalog
Flow so crazy it's Adderall with the padded walls
More twisted turns than the body that's on the baddest broad
These cattle call rappers is weak, my honor matter more
Your whole style stiffer than mannequins you see at a store
You +Maniquins+ are Chant√© and Kenny, I mean the +Latter-more+
No ping-pong and we volleyin with the back and forth
Straight King Kong and the trap we blastin off, son

[Raekwon]
You want Nigerian money, see me in Qatar drunk
Wavin the K, I can't fake the funk
Blessed with the belts, flyin in the stealths
Jewelry on the neck, diamonds in the Chels'
You know I wrestle with pawns, gettin my money, we gone
The automatic lean a player, we dons
You can't see us, the new phenoms, I like the Benz-eons
Split your wig like I got three arms
I need a fianc', at least a Beyonc'
I know my vision beyond some other shit, I'm just as meaty as moms
Supposed to be on, the greenery gone, I'm still the king of the drama
Put the Ruger down your throat, eat my Johnson nigga

[Talib Kweli]
Way they all in their feelings, what's wrong 
with niggaz? Forgettin silence is still a response
The way the blood paint the wall you can tell he really an artist
I get it like Whitey Bulger 'til rapture, dearly +Departed+

[Chorus 2X: Raekwon] + (Talib Kweli)
We Rolexin, my nigga (these are blessings, my nigga)
Keep stressin, my nigga (don't stress, lil' nigga)
Eat a clip, lil' nigga (niggaz trip, lil' nigga)
[both] Violations we gon' flip, little nigga!

[Talib Kweli]
It's the champion flow, the Jordan, LeBron and Kobe
The Obi-Wan Kenobi of gettin that guap-amole
We tourin overseas, got her +Fanning+ out like a Dakota
I'm tryin to get the check/Czech, I'm Martina Navratilova
Catch me at the races, gateway at Saratoga
They tryin to place my face cause we mobbin, we takin over
My niggaz keep it pure while you cut with the bakin soda
These rappers be stretchin the truth like they takin yoga
Couch potatoes, now they made us into a vegetable culture
A result, of the vision like it's a decimal quotient
Do the math my nigga, do the math
You'd never settle for, less than the whole if you knew the half

[Raekwon]
Aiyyo, rough as alligator skin gettin crazy grip
I'm so amazing with words, I make a baby spit
Restin in Tibet, wild with a Gillette
Giraffe long goose on, my boots is {?}
Pocket full of coins, producers on set
Niggaz with the coupes is on next
The losers gon' step, the users gon' check
We choosin our ninjas, the jewels is on deck
Refuse, that's the depth, pool with the steps
Everybody see us, the tools is all Tecs
Anything come through we school, wan' bet?
Fuck you gon' tell us? He knew we on next

[Talib Kweli]
Check; they wanna act like they know me, you don't know me nigga
You got that +Baby Boy+ hustle, you a Jody nigga
You wanna swim with the sharks, I'm Chief Brody killin
Get your +Jaw+ tapped, this is raw rap, c'mon yeah

[Chorus]
