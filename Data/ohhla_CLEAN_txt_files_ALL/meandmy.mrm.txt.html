Chorus: [Mr. Marcelo]

It's me and you, one on one, against the world
Every man needs a woman, every boy needs a girl
In my world I'm just a squirrel trying to get a nutt
Thought it was love seems like it turned to lust 
Tell me what's up, baby am I wasting my time?
I would love to get with you, and have a family of mine
It's me and you, one on one, against the world
Every man needs a woman, every boy needs a girl
In my world I'm just a squirrel, trying to get a nutt
Thought it was love seems like it turned to lust 
Tell me what's up, baby am I wasting my time?
I would love to get with you, and have a family of mine

[Mr. Marcelo]
Me and my girl, better yet me and my shawty
Early morn', smoke a blunt, drink a half of forty
What's the half baby?, you know you got to be down
And show me love, cause don't nobody want no scrub
What's up?, you know the half baby, cause it's you
And ain't no better picture than this 80 and you
I know the money ain't right, but soon it will be
I'ma make a better life for you if it kills me
In a mintue, it's gonna be gravy, you ain't gonna want for shit
Not cause you stuck with a nigga, because you deserve the shit
Young black queen, you need one on your team
When it rains and it storms, you'll be sleeping in arms
Deep in a poem, lies around, that shows your trust
it shows those times that y'all fussed, it didn't mean that much
For such a little thang, it's all blown up in flames
Now you think I'm 'bout to pack and leave my lil' mane?
Hell no, it ain't that easy, when done been through to much
It's some shit, down the toilet,kinda hard to flush
Hush, close your mouth, cause I'm through with that fussin'
Hit the lights, bump the Lauryn Hill, let's start this lovin'

Chorus: [Mr. Marcelo]

It's me and you, one on one, against the world
Every man needs a woman, every boy needs a girl
In my world I'm just a squirrel trying to get a nutt
Thought it was love seems like it turned to lust 
Tell me what's up, baby am I wasting my time?
I would love to get with you, and have a family of mine
It's me and you, one on one, against the world
Every man needs a woman, every boy needs a girl
In my world I'm just a squirrel, trying to get a nutt
Thought it was love seems like it turned to lust 
Tell me what's up, baby am I wasting my time?
I would love to get with you, and have a family of mine

[Mr. Marcelo]
Diamond rangs and big chains, you can have those thangs
Jags, Coups, Camry hoops, you can have those thangs
That's nothing to a player when he's made it to his label
We make love all night long with big faces on the table
Remember that house you talked about?, two hundred arces of land
Fuck cars, we ride stars, or doonebuggies in the sand
Sippin' moet, a night that you'll never forget
Pour champange down your chest and you're drippin' wet
You think it's a game?, nah baby this everlasting
At night, on your wrist, they feel platinum plasterd
Private jets, 50 jets, from Cali to Texas
In the morning, when you're awake, it's just some kind ghetto breakfast
Me and you baby, motherfuck the haters
Cause it's made when we step we rock the two-tone gators
Served proper by the waiters, all food be catered
You ain't gotta see the kitchen, you just lay there and say it
If you want something, you ain't gottta ask for nothing
It's the new millenuim baby, push the button
You wanna take a vaction, how far you wanna go?
Africa?, Jamica?, France?, or Puerto Rico?

Chorus: [Mr. Marcelo]

It's me and you, one on one, against the world
Every man needs a woman, every boy needs a girl
In my world I'm just a squirrel trying to get a nutt
Thought it was love seems like it turned to lust 
Tell me what's up, baby am I wasting my time?
I would love to get with you, and have a family of mine
It's me and you, one on one, against the world
Every man needs a woman, every boy needs a girl
In my world I'm just a squirrel, trying to get a nutt
Thought it was love seems like it turned to lust 
Tell me what's up, baby am I wasting my time?
I would love to get with you, and have a family of mine
It's me and you....</pre>
