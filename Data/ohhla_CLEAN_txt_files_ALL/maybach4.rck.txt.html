[Intro]
{M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
There's no fanatics around here baby
No fanatics
{J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League}

[Rick Ross]
Yeah~! Such a breath of fresh air
Get a blow job, have a seizure on the Lear
Or get a new car, I could lease it for a year
Or bring it back tomorrow, that's a lease that disappear
Count new money, peelin out a venue
New Maybach after it was discontinued
Never question mine, my mind is so inventive
Quadrupled my net worth and threw in a few incentives
Maybach IV, the allure that I adore
All money game, we got ones in the floor
See me on the wood nigga, pause at the game
Two mill' the jewels, no flaws ask them lames
Bow to the boss in the presence of a don
Started on the corner nigga, didn't have a coin
Playin my position for a club that I can join
Never in the draft, but that boy know he goin!
Throw me a bone, get me a brick
That's on the Qu'ran I'ma go and get the chips
Go and get a rental, I got a cute bitch
She's showin some potential, so we takin trips
Nigga assets last while memories fade
I'ma, patch that ass, I don't get paid
I'm a Mike Tyson type of, typewriter sniper
Double M life until a nigga pay the piper
Uhh, I love when the beat dip
Same way I love to see a ki' flip
Go and pay your momma house off
Get sucked off, shorty wipe your mouth off
I'm alive, you could never write the South off
Southpaw, box a nigga off like a outlaw
Quick thinker, big better shut your mouth what?
Black chips, gold bottles ship it out raw
Pullin up slow, look at that boy
Young B.I.G., Lil' Kim on tour
Lil' Cease with me, all the cheese with me
All the G's with me, Maybach Eazy-E

[Interlude]
The good times don't last long
Just rewind the last song
We all shared some great times
As I read some great rhymes

[Ne-Yo]
What we does, is what dreams are made of
Come and get your love, all of this love

[Rick Ross]
Five hundred for the car that I got on the strip
That's another hundred what I got on my wrist
Eight hunred for the jar that I'm 'bout to twist
It's a female strand, you know life's a bitch
As I get high, move my curtains to the side
Age like fine wine, ambitions they never die
Niggaz get abused like boys at Penn State
Greatest that ever did it, decided my own fate

[Ne-Yo]
Dreams, everything that we are
The life that we're livin, baby it's ours
Dreams, money homes and cars
Baby that's a given
I'm talkin 'bout every fantasy
Be good real with me
Still don't mean something, ooohhh, oh
Baby come with me and live the dream

[Outro]
{J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League} {M-M-M-M-Maybach Music!}
It's a whole 'nother different element right?
It's Maybach roman numeral, IV {M-M-M-M-Maybach Music!}
You couldn't fathom this, you couldn't imagine this
You can't produce this, you won't reproduce this

[Ne-Yo]
I'll be dreamin of you {*2X*}
You'll be makin it come true {Maybach Music}
I'll be dreamin of you {Maybach Music} I'll, I'll
{Maybach Music}
I'll be dreamin of you {*2X*} {Maybach Music} {*2X*}
You'll be makin it come true {Maybach Music}
I'll be dreamin of you {M-M-M}

[L.A. Reid]
Yessir
This is L.A. Reid {M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
It takes a boss to know a boss
It takes greatness to recognize greatness
Ricky Ross, the boss, Maybach IV
