{Big Supreme}
Aiyo
Be Big Supreme Just, lyrics laced 2000 cuts
Non melodic melodies razor burnin ya guts
Turn gas to liquid, but the flow be solid
Years from the light, days to comin be rowded mathematical
Actually solar, when light, strike the style ya bite
Supreme mine, communation, always relatin the burst to 120
Then I'm out with the burst
Physical well fed, to chop trees with whip blades
Study, meditate, build on the page
To describe the microphone in me
Shit god damn, I be at it again
When this shit gonna end
That's not the plan yo
Word

One two one two now, no time to waste
So much at stake, major dough to make
Recognize the real from the fake
Yeah carry out laws of life on the mic
But check it
With the butter phat beats I send
So hot like baby oil, sink right in
Quick absorption
The only way I do, put my word of bond to it
Wrote a rhyme in the air, life smoke, so thick
Make the whole muthafuckin spot choke yea

Skills ring, like naked pie manifest to the whole world
Droppin diamonds and pearls in the rhyme skit
Up to day, we emerge
Work hard so I get all absorbed
And the crowd, once again makin hip hop pure
And oh yeah, by the way
I got brown galore, to go long and strong
And make my way inside, yeah
You can't run you can't hide, I told ya

Chorus
Key to gettin success is power refined
Power refined
Power refined
Power refined
Power refined
The key to gettin success

So you a Roy Boy Jetson nigga now
Future fistic kid, told you, you ain't see my bid
Supreme rebel sight beyond the back inside
The magnetic pull hard
Hold tight for the ride on the wave click select
Pull it, the prophet
Uptown underground sound
How I get down to soap off and god and wise and righteous
Black Queen Supreme Mine, set to bless this
Cuz every single verse is a record, check
Yeah every single verse is a record, yo
Take time to blow, stay pay made
From the beginnin my intention is provide a
And assist the first rince of this hip hop shit 
People saw me everyday, it's a two waste in effects
From the idea, you know the year
I take La to the membrane, blessin, penetratin, and I miss
Cause me to act straight, be straight, see straight in the lie
The key to gain success is the power refined

Chorus</pre>
