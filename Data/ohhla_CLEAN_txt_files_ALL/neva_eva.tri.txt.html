["Get on my level ho" repeated in background throughout song]

[Hook 2X: Trillville] + (Lil Jon)
Bitch nigga you can neva eva, eva eva
Eva eva, eva eva eva eva
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (What!)
Get on my level ho (What!)

[Dirty Mouth]
Get the fuck back, get the fuck back already
I ain't playin' nann day
Prove a nigga whatcha say
Meet me anywhere, I don't care it don't matter to me
Cause if ya fuckin' step, I'ma step in yo vicinity
What, you think I'm a ho nigga please you ain't on my level
Get some rank bitch while I'm diggin' ya grave with a shovel
Time after time I ask myself is it really clever
For you to get with me, bitch nigga you can neva eva
Rank on my level, I'm pushin Chevrolet pedal
If you niggas fuck with me I got that chrome, heavy metal
Never settle for less but always strive for the best
Most these niggas playin chief'll put ya straight to the test

[Hook x2]

[Don Peezy]
My Benz, looka at my 'Ac
Look at my Navi' and my 'Lac
Get on my level, hell nah neva that
I knew you wasn't real cause all ya do is chit-chat
Always slizzle makin' sho' I stay gone
Call us some broad to the Geor-Georgia Dome
Tryin' to get with me is like naps through a comb
They call me Don P AKA Corlio
Up in the club with my Cartier's on
Don't know if I'm high, drunk, or gettin' my roll on
He on the cell "Can ya hear me" hell nah
Get on my level, that's what I'm tryin' to tell y'all
For real

[Hook x2]

[LA]
LA off in this thang, get up on my level ho
Bitch nigga you can neva eva, eva eva hang
Bitch nigga step the fuck back and if ya think I'm jokin
Aks them niggas that tried to play us, see 'em lyin off in that coffin
Trillville, ATL swangin swangin throwin bows
Got some niggas that be hatin bustin slugs at my foes
If ya thinkin' you can fuck with a nigga like me
Nah nigga get rich, Trillville and BME
What the fuck you talkin' about "What you deep" nigga what!
If a hater wanna hate then a hater gettin' bust
We ain't hard to find nigga so why ya steadily talkin' shit
I'm fixin' to sick my dogs ho
Pussy nigga, get big nigga ho

[Lil Scrappy]
Get crunk out ya brains when I spit this verse
I'm a blood suckin' vampire, my venom is worse
Head bustas deal with dangerous thirsts
Shatter ya bones in ya chest and make ya motherfuckin heart burst
Don't worry now, best of the South on the map
Knock yo thoughts out and leave yo brains on ya lap
Don't touch my Kango shorty, what's wrong with you
I might drop my fist back and knock yo grill through

[Hook x2]

[Lil Jon x8]
Run around the motherfuckin club</pre>
