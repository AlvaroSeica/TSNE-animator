[Andy Cooper]
I can't help falling again, here I go.. and I know
I can't help falling again, here I go.. and I know

I said I wasn't gonna do it and then
I went right out and did it, lookin stupid again
And it's no surprise, I've failed before
Just another encore on my way to the floor

[Dizzy Dustin]
Don't ask me why, I can't explain
How I keep spiraling down the drain
I guess it's the way I tend to cope with the pain
To stay oblivious while I soak in the rain

[Andy Cooper]
And man, I thought I had it all under control
That no one could know
That I had ever sunken so low
But then I saw a look get locked in your eye
And I knew I was hooked and caught in my lie

[Dizzy Dustin]
So, if I have to I'll cry some tears
And tell everybody what they'd like to hear
But my whole world's caving in on me
Trapped and I can barely breathe

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
As I lay awake at night and watch
the clock and shake and fight the pain
And try in vain to stop when I know
I can't help falling again, there I go (There I go)
Saying it's the last time when I know
I'll just keep falling again, no control (No control)
So Im reaching up to you cause I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know

[Dizzy Dustin]
It's another case of deja vu
While you wait around hoping my mistakes are through
I just tell myself that it's no big deal
And never stop to think how it makes you feel

[Andy Cooper]
As Im lookin for a quick fix to restore my fitness
Im listless and can't make any commitments
No ability to stayed relaxed
I spent fast, now Im paying the tax

[Dizzy Dustin]
Plus I've got an itch that I just can't scratch
When you slip through the cracks it's hard to come back
But still I keep trying to get on my feet
Everybody's sure that Im in too deep

[Andy Cooper]
And please, I really wish the rumors would stop
The things people tend to say and do when they talk
So loose and free and accusingly
I think of how it used to be

[Chorus: Andy Cooper]
As I lay awake at night and watch
the clock and shake and fight the pain
And try in vain to stop when I know
I can't help falling again, there I go (There I go)
Saying it's the last time when I know
I'll just keep falling again, no control (No control)
So Im reaching up to you cause I know
I can't help falling again, there I go (There I go)
Saying it's the last time when I know
I'll just keep falling again, no control (No control)
So Im reaching up to you cause I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know

[Andy Cooper]
I can't help falling again, here I go.. and I know
I can't help falling again, here I go.. and I know
I can't help falling again, here I go.. and I know
I can't help falling again...
