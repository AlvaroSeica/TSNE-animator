[Ake]
I won't stop I won't quit, till these niggaz admit
That I'm the shit, platinum placks everytime that I spit
I'm on this mic and on a mission, cause I gotta get mine
And if a nigga try to stop it, then he gotta lay down
See I'm like the Clipse, cause I stay on my grind
Everytime I fall up, niggaz stop and rewind
I'm still that Dirty 3rd Nigga, that squeeze Dirty 3rd triggers
And if you ask me what I'm bout, I tell the world I'm bout my figures
Fuck you haters, y'all ain't nothing but mini men
I'm trying to keep my shit folding, while you stack your fin's man
And I ain't even playing, yeah I'm down with my killas
Yes in person it be like, that's the wrecking poo-poo realer
It's the thousand dollar spenders, your body on the curb
You can't get in my car with drank, or you'll waste all your syrup
I be so hard, people be like Ake a vet
Don't ask them whisperings, they can't hear the shit and I wreck
I never spit whack, man don't make Ake a tech
But when Ake a tech nigga, you better be way back
Or you'll get hit by the mack, and I ain't talking about 10
I'm talking bout my gun, do you wanna meet my little friend

[Tite]
Ake it's in my bloodline, that's why I spit so raw
And I done lost my best friend, due to a nigga he fought
I seen some shit, that most cats just rap about
And I done felt pain, I'm still trying to factor out
Streets is real, sometimes these streets'll kill
But at the same time, these streets is how you eat your meals
Hustled the block, to make it cause the times is hard
The only peace a nigga get, is the time with the Lord
I often pray, for something just to better my way
Feeling Pac when he spoke, about a better day
I gotta get it dog, cause ain't nobody giving handouts
And if you got it, I'ma take you and your man out
Nigga the hood is my life, the hood is my life
I'm a fiend, and this hood is my pipe
See I done been through hell, and I done been through jail
Most of my life, was broke without I been through mail
I done smoked the weed, and I done sipped the drank
All I know is cutting dope, trying to flip this bank
That's why I move, like a real G suppose to
You want proof, then motherfucker I can show you

[Chalie]
This is for you hateeeeers, let me tell you
You gotta sin, and I done smell you
One on one is cool, but if you talking bout jumping
I'll act a fool, but until then what I'ma do
Is sit on the sideline, my time yes I'm about mine
Until my name is brought up, in a situation
Present yourself, I'ma get up swang up
Cock back and bust, and put a dent in your head
Don't hold your breath, I'm only throwing stones
At a pack of wolves, if you get hit bitch then bring it dog
Well just speaking of chrome, or using verbal tones
It really don't matter, cause it's gonna burn in your bones
My zone and section is filled
With haters and chrome, and plexing but still
I try to maintain, possession of skill
So that I may gain perfection, and that's reeeeeal

(*talking*)
Yeah, Big Rob the Rhino
