Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Skepta, Roll Deep, yeh E16, N17, E3, SW9, E14, N13
We do dis ting. Rules and regulations
I've been a skuller doing ching chang walla
Real life, not no sci-fi horror
Walk by today, drive-by tomorrow
Talk out, get blazed, why do you bother?
You've been wally since Tim Tam Tommy
Go raves, get paid, but they don't wanna do it proper
Rep my crew Roll Deep, since Ip Dip Do, And I always have something to offer
Brand new clobber, paid top well I, plus I aint no shotter or robber
If you bare good at grime n ting then don't bother-get smacked up today, get smacked up tomorrow
If you wanna take the piss then you're gonna hear something else holla
See that girl over there- she's mine, I'm on her, so family don't bother

Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the roll deep crew, then no longting we regulate that
Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the roll deep crew, then no longting we regulate that

Yo, my name is Skepta, I'm in Roll Deep but I live in North London so sometimes I don't see them
More time I see Wiley and Matt Scratchy and Danny and Scratch, Flow Dan and Karnage on the weekend
No G's in trouble, my nigga, that's why I'm sellin boydem to freedem
Some man don't know that I'm in roll deep, coz they never heard me on In At The Deep End
I rep roll deep but I'm not from E3, don't hate me coz you see me on the TV
talk about what you gonna do when you see me, and when you see me you say Skepta, wah gwan, easy
That's how I know you ain't greezy
I lick a shot and disappear like a genie, everybody in the country knows me
I'm a soul survivor like young jeezy

Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the roll deep crew, then no longting we regulate that
Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the roll deep crew, then no longting we regulate that

Ok, I don't know what them man are on
Buss, man are gone, gone with the old argument, time to move on
Dem man are hiding, let them carry on. The studios' built, now nuff more songs
Non stop bars, non stop beats, non stop heat I mean non stop bombs
Non stop cash when I got my gat, too many can't flock that
Become a non stop gonner
I mean non stop acting, non stop tactics, man I practice on your spastics
See, say I topple and iron like lying in a Zion
Check that, deep, dem man are French plastic
Biggin em again them man are just matchsticks. I aint playin games, them are not match-fit
Although they chat shit, we've been doin dis ting and you can't chuck a ting from this

Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the roll deep crew, then no longting we regulate that
Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the roll deep crew, then no longting we regulate that
Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the roll deep crew, then no longting we regulate that
Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the roll deep crew, then no longting we regulate that

Yeh man. Look, all I wanna do is celebrate, play nice games like chess; checkmate
Separate the rude from the fake-are you one of them?
Real recognize real game that's the bullet and Jet Le that's me I boogie
come to the dance in a blacked out buggy, leave out the dance with a girl in a mini
When I get come home gonna show her my buddy
Money, funny how it changes the plot, the UK's on the block, yeh that's a lot
Take times so you take times say please. This country's system aint designed for me
So I gotta move up how I move up, been through the hard times
Heartbreak, Of. Jet be humble but Jet was quick. Celebrate life coz the hoodies see the blick

Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the roll deep crew, then no longting we regulate that
Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the roll deep crew, then no longting we regulate that</pre>
