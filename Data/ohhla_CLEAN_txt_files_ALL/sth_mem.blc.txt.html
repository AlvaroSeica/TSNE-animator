[Gangsta Blac]
Welcome to my battleground, ready I'm going to start it off
ended with the silent sound to tear this bitch from wall to wall
nigga now my frame of mind, to keep in mind the casualties
If that click click quick to trip, bitch it be the tragedy
S.P.V. we market thee
down for doing what it takes
no mistake, cause bitch we walk the thin from day to day
careful for I'm fucking with, always watching what I say
Ten-Toes soldier, down for doja, cause if I do is where I lay
STH. MEM. Bitch it aint no testing these
dollar bills we folding, still control what ever fucks with me
dirtys in my fucking face, Mitchell Heights to buck it up
Treatin Loderdale the BDL will urk and hender us
BDL mean break da law
see and tell them what you saw
see they fucking with me, cause Gangsta Blac gonna set it off
got time damn near every day, every spot I'm in da house
bitch we play no games hoe, I just one up out the Dirty South, nigga

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
STH MEM where I come from
Time for some action one for all, all for one

[Gangsta Blac]
To every extreme measure 
whether it be casualties from your side of the line or mine
I'm in the line of duty amputations by the tooley
Dirty South here to ruley, consequences moody
multiples of gorillas in sequence deep in the evening
let them bitches mangle even they fucking ????? was bleeding
We just infected the germ, feed the maggots and worms
taking turns dance around the fire while the bitches flag burn
Hence these stripes of a South Memphis nigga I earned
marched through the fire ???????? then yall learn
No glory bringin them warriors to this ignored clan
I can just hurt em' man
waiting on them six bets, we sticking like leaves on some doja
elbow to elbow, shoulder to shoulder
holla God S.P.V. and Louderdale, we hot to death
ride or die STH. MEM. Life or death. YES YES YES!!
Cool Bee:
Cheafin hay everyday the Southpark way
I keep the nine on my side nigga everyday
you can call it what you want, so nigga let what
I'm with the Gangsta Blac in da S.P.V. we getting buck
I'm smoking green with them thugs showing love
from the A-T-L to the S.P.V. Cool Bee be coming up
Light up the sticky sticky
Bee getting high with the Gangsta Blac, defining wicky wicky
see me and my nigga nine, smoking on chronic sack
Cool Bee with the S.P.V. my nigga aint having that
I was raised a bastard child
I represent ghetto style
nigga please I'm about that cheeze
no enemies I don't need
Put your pistols in da air mane, time to go to fucking war mane
I'm gonna keep it real to the end mane, 
my glock protect my best friend mane
they say I'm totally insane, with this pit bullet I'm locked mane
a nigga get love in the streets mane, 
cause a nigga gotta get that cheeze mane.

[Chorus] (Repeat 2x)

[Playa Fly]
Disaster for the master, my Mafia every laughter

I'm S-T to Iz-H; MEM. You hizay

Then Gangsta wrote the lyiroc, now Flizy got ya'll hizot

come on here Tony Bizone, lets Mae until we gizone
bump earth up off it axis and make your bizness knizone
and keep movin izone for Bill Chill and Oweeme
