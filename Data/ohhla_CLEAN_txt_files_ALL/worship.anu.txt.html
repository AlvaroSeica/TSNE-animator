I am fighting the alien agenda
I threaten war to any being, never offer my surrender
In my warship, I'm worshipping my warship
My warship, I'm worshipping my warship
I'll smash your fucking lawnmower man
You're preying on the predator that refuses to take commands
On my warship, I'm worshipping my warship
My warship, I'm worshipping my warship

Phil Schneider shot two alien greys
Saved by a black beret from being an afterworld slave
In Dulce, they dug tunnels miles deep under the ground
Completely in isolation from the next neighboring town
They knew about the alien threat and still progressed
So Phil found himself in the rabbit hole after all
See Phil was a contractor, hired for construction
Pension never covers these types of reprocussions
Self-reknowned geologist he could look at rock layers
And earn his bottom dollar from American tax payers
The basket ride was deep making way through smothering ash
And time it just elapsed
A putrid stench leaked from the bottom corrosive
His objection composition to sit the shaped explosive
That they still had to set down 
In order to break the foundation on the seemingly still ground
What he found lacked logical explanation
He was then aware of all the stories of cattle mutilation
Creatures invading the area and local skies
Missing people reports came to life in front of his eyes
He saw three of them standing
He stood petrified and scared as his basket came to it's landing
Boiling vats of red liquid, simmering limbs
Clean cut and small like that of childrens
It's because children are the purest to poke in
No contaminants in their blood so they use it to soak in
They get high off of our fear
Inhaling secreted pheremones timeless touch of tears
He reached his left hand to grab his gun
Fired two shots as the third just stood there stunned
Not sure of what he just did, Phil in a panic stood grim 
With gun still single fisted
Rubbing it's chest it emitted blue beams
That burned through his abdomen and took three
Of his fingers as he was thrown back into the basket
And was dragged miles up
Well Phil came cleam twenty years after the battle
Saying what he saw was only a sample
Travelling state to state at conferences
In his own immortal moment the government put a stop to it
Phil was found strangled in his home, made to believe it was suicide
Hero driven survivor just died
The only problem is he only had two fingers on his left 
And couldn't tie the hose around his neck


I'm worshipping my warship

I am fighting the alien agenda
I threaten war to any being, never offer my surrender
In my warship, I'm worshipping my warship
My warship, I'm worshipping my warship
I'll smash your fucking lawnmower man
You're preying on the predator that refuses to take commands
On my warship, I'm worshipping my warship
My warship, I'm worshipping my warship

"I killed two of them. Yes they are immortal and they do die.
 However, in the process one of them did this.
 All I remember is that he waved his hand in front of his chest
 and the next thing I know this blue beam hit me
 and just literally opened me up like a fish.
 Burnt my fingers right off of me and it was some form of electrical force."</pre>
