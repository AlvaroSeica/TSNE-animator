[Takbir]
Aiyyo, first things first
It's time to shake ground in the eighth round
Box battle and break down
For the beak in the rhyme tone
jump in the cyclone
S-T-Y-L-E-S, yes I know
Give the rap phene vaccine
packed red beam
Put 'em up, what the fuck
You plucked a bad seed
Off the wall, spittin' the guerilla tag team
What's up now, duck down stuff that can't breathe

[Ryu]
Yo, you know the routine, the team in effect
Please, don't step, you wanna feed one of my pet peeves?
The more beef the better; sound gay
But you all wanna sleep together, ok
In the club we don't sneak berettas
Why not? We got so much street credit, the fuckin' police let us
Now that's bullshit, cause we don't pack heat
So come and get your head crackin' up at me

[Chorus]
Kick it- movin' it's on now
Making it punk loud
Shaking the buck wild
Rapin' the punk style
Fakin' the funk pal
Dunk watch the punk
What now? Watch your battleship get sunk down
Click (click) pow (pow) Nine (nine) Thou (thou)
What? Just what I thought, what's up now?
Huh! Huh! *Buck shots through the speaker*
