[Intro: DJ Spin One cuts]
"'spect the unexpected" -&gt; Method Man

[Chorus: Q-Unique]
Respect the unexpected
Press play to my cassette when yours gets ejected
This money in this rap got some brothers livin' hectic
Distracted while they acted I snuck in undetected
Quaternarys connected
----
Respect the unexpected
Press play to my cassette when yours gets ejected
This money in this rap got some sisters gettin' naked
Distracted while they acted I snuck in undetected
Quaternarys connected

[Verse One: Jise One]
Expect that I selected molested rhymes aggressive
Impetiuos notebook medic couldn't reconstruct the relic
Simplistical explanation for me to rock the mic
Incredible, incombatible, speak in parables like neophytes
Coincide tight with might of urban joust
Gladiator, illiminator and every day common incinirator
Perpetraders get tapered zoned to fire frequency
Blessed by predecessors so I've grown to mass fluidity
Vast impurities get flushed in lavatories
Minority flashy stories don't cut the chase it lures me
Poor me! Because I used to be a thug
I should've elaborated produced rotation bugs

[Verse Two: Q-Unique]
I close the open mic and lock it with key elements of everlasting phrases
It's the way I flow with grace that amazes
All praises due to Q who do true
You don't, cannot, shouldn't you
The little engine that couldn't
Me the stop that wouldn't
You concerned with material
Me the rebel allie to crush the imperial, burnin' down your ministerial
You the 15-minutes-of-fame rap act
Me the heavy handed MC to smack track
You the Mr. trapped-by-wack-contract
Me the black flag to kill on contact
You the dead roach, me the head coach
You player ready for retirement
Me better for the environment
You better think, me better ink
Get her any wetter than a sink, brother let her drink

(Chorus)

[Verse Three: Jise One]
Watch me give it a shrug, I rather fondle impairment
Awareness leaving the bareness of my culture stand in arraignment
I'm level basement incarcerated tracks to my advanced
Romance dig in your earlobe enhanced rivoting soul stance
Every day's my last chance, tranquilizing the present
Utilizing the past the future sharpened reception
No acceptance applicants, never extradited wackness
Practice malice inbalance, don't silence my code of challenge

[Verse Four: Q-Unique]
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want to contaminate
Nah.. none of that, I'm stickin' well within my habitat
Got the hip for all the hops, bottom out until the top of the top tip hits with grit shit
Then I'ma shift into high gear, my year, every year
Let me hear someone near cheer
Q blaze that and I'ma lose it like a needle in a haystack
and payback like installment plans my fist twist unlisted lines
You can't call it man, my pen ink.. amazes the page with engraved phrases
and raise to "hey" stages and put an end to the weak/week like paid wages
You left behind ass crack
I bounced from ASCAP and linked with BMI
'cause a brothers mind's incredible, now you seeing why..
Q get the "Unique" definition, the one in the preminition
said to lead the underground into victory over the evil industry
Fade outs and rollin' credits couldn't finish me
Never mind fine wines, I speak prime lines to my kinds
Deadin' the 100 watt spotlight with 1000 drop mind shines

(Chorus)</pre>
