[Intro: Nas]
Large Pro., Nas.  Traveling through your mind one time.
Get bliss to this.

[Verse One: Nas]
The greatest lesson ever learned, has yet to be taught
niggaz running outta court like "what the fuck they thought?"
It made me somber, my mans I just can't picture being locked up
they used to being mad fly
850 I style
Cherokee, letters read Nas they could never bury me
but kill me, my nigga you free
Truly, reppin' QB
my life is like a movie
The credits at the end
and the film plays again
The script is every rhyme I ever said 
off the head
Infinity drive
Without a sound Queens bound
Paully got a call for war out from 40
Meeting out in Beach Channel
with peeps from Hammel
Blunted niggaz get roasted in they rides
soak they tongues to Remy
Heat's in the 5 series  high and leery
when those blue and white cars drive near me
Avirex, Gore-TeX wet with fly jewelry
Israelite original insight and lethal
first Hebrew
God sent golden Asian phenomenal
you can't say the name Nas without saying the honorable
Wealthy, Wall Street read the chronicle
I fuck big titty chicks
who sip the Long Island City lix
Drunk off the Azay (Alize) with Henny mixed
Mad niggaz is jail like TCB teach me
everything you see ain't always what it be
Hardly able to chill night ills feeling slight chills
finding out that rich nigga got to write wills
High 'til I die Eldorado red pack the Uz-o
pretty thug Last Don by Mario Puzo

[Verse Two: Large Professor]
Stages and places that we go through
in a lifetime, maybe more than a few
'Cuz one day you're A and the next you may
have a brand new topic and see a new way
Like history, while it's repeating 
I'm beating the drum on the dumb and blurry don't worry
The least bit
about shit when the weak split
The raw brain remains 
long range
This is possible I know and charge like a rhino
bro, I gotta let this music go
For the maestro 
climbs higher heights yo
Season a bass line
and mind of a Bandog shrine
In hell, can't tell 
all the times I fell
But can
tell the thing called man I stand
In the eyes of the father tasteful like guava
unravel and break down a tec and solve a
Problem, in no time you'll lose your mind
tryin' to calculate the rate of the Large's incline
Out of nowhere, I go where few can go
on the strength I be rising on tunes and flow
with the flock very seldom 
words when I weld them
Connect for the perfect brew
I you</pre>
