Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
How to begin, can I be honest?
It took a while just to write this, well here it is
I needed courage just to grab the pen
The same weapon you affected me with when I used to recite this
That's my word, it's so ironic
How these phonics are made of frequency waves that can stir
Oceans of emotions and invoke them old things
I need composure just to compose them
Digging up memories I tried to bury
Unlocking tombs that I bolted
And I don't know if you'll ever hear me
But I got salt in my wounds from the tears that resulted
Every hurt shows we're mortal
And every scar has a story, every story has a moral
Every memory's a portal to the past pain
And most of the time is caused by somebody with your last name

[Chorus]
Like a car running into a brick wall
Is how your words crashed into my heart
What was so minor to you was so major to me
And all I wait for is words like "sorry", "forgive me"
I'm still bleeding, I'm still bleeding
I'm still bleeding, I'm still bleeding

[Verse 2]
The same tongue that you used to say you love me
Was being shoved in somebody else's mouth
Don't you touch me, I'm disgusted
You should've just told me that you lust me
Trust fell out from underneath me
And the walls from the house we built fell down and then crushed me
Walking on stilts, losing my balance
Your words are so filthy, you don't even know the damage
God used words to create this planet so be careful with 'em
It isn't even really what you said, it's what you didn't
I left text and voice mails, you acting like you missed them
I got confirmation they delivered
You spoke silence, you just go and stay quiet like I ain't existed
Well, look at that thing shifted
At first you blew kisses now you want some more slickness
And I ain't even got it inside me to give forgiveness
I gotta find it at the place where he said it's finished
Yeah, you tried to kill me with your words
But now I used words to make a living
With a DJ or how the tables turn
So I'mma use mine to point people to the savior
The one who speaks life to the dead and they wake up
Stick and stones may break some bones
And some words scar forever, your heart forever
Make it hard to get up, hurt people, hurt people see you
Were just bleeding and you wanted me to bleed too

[Chorus]
Like a car running into a brick wall
Is how your words crashed into my heart
What was so minor to you was so major to me
And all I wait for is words like "sorry", "forgive me"
I'm still bleeding, I'm still bleeding
I'm still bleeding, I'm still bleeding</pre>
