Song:   Girl (Boom Boom Pump)
Typed by: @Daneo10

CHORUS:
Girl
You never know, this might be your last chance to love me
Girl
I really don't think that you wanna be givin' this up!
Girl
Admit it, your new life really ain't all that comfy
I know I make your heart go
"Boom Boom Pump"

Baby girl, I'm getting sick of the complaining
How we connect and you ain't getting' much action
Think about it, what kinda nigga don't ever wanna fuck?
We divided, friction cause fractions
There's an attraction, but you've subtracted
The characteristic intrinsic with lovin'
Why you buggin'? All of a sudden you cussing me
For shit I never done, and you calling me stubborn?
You want a husband, but your trust is
Obliterated 'cause of a past that I can't undo
Plus I know about your little daddy issue
Got you ripping through your tissues but I ain't do how he done you
We had fun true? Okay fine
There's a time I was lying but we weren't even together yet
Man, how do women so quickly get over feelings
About a bond they once swore to God was forever meant?

CHORUS:
Girl
You never know, this might be your last chance to love me
Girl
I really don't think that you wanna be givin' this up!
Girl
Admit it, your new life really ain't all that comfy
I know I make your heart go
"Boom Boom Pump"

Listen up, I'm thinking you was kinda hasty
Breaking up with me, was it the right decision?
'Cause now you calling me every day and you balling forever saying
"Let's talk" I'm in an awkward position
'Cause our division got me enlisting
The services of women who love to get in my bedroom
'Cause the aggression I'm taking out with the sex and affection
Without a question, is helping keeping my head cool
You say you meant to stay as a friend who
Is open and honest about everything in her new life
All you want is a nigga to keep a promise
That if he does meet a goddess to reveal if she a dude's wife
But in a true light, all we do's fight
When I admitted I was back to hittin' hoes hard
You did exactly as I thought, you was calling me a fraud
Said you knew it from the start, I'd break your heart
Come on

CHORUS:
Girl
You never know, this might be your last chance to love me
Girl
I really don't think that you wanna be givin' this up!
Girl
Admit it, your new life really ain't all that comfy
I know I make your heart go
"Boom Boom Pump"

Check it out, gimme a second to remind you
You was the one who decided to call it "Splitsville"
Now that I'm runnin' some other beans, you huffin' and puffin' steam
You suffer and scream you can't sit still
Hey yo it's ill how beans get spilled
'Cause you already got another guy you're talking to
And you admitted he hit it and that you two are committed
Making it obvious that logic is lost on you
'Cause if your heart was true, you would toss the dude
And take the time to find yourself a state of happiness
'Cause if you bringin' in the stress, you begin another mess
That'll make your love hurt like a masochist
You want passionate? Well the facts just is
I ain't gonna give my heart to another joobie
Yo, you coulda had my love, but you had to give a shove
To any hope that our relationship ain't over to me

CHORUS (x2):
Girl
You never know, this might be your last chance to love me
Girl
I really don't think that you wanna be givin' this up!
Girl
Admit it, your new life really ain't all that comfy
I know I make your heart go
