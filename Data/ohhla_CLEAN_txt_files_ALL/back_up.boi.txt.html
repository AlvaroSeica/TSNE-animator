[Intro: Big Boi]
Put that bitch in smash mode!
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan
(And one and two, now you know what to do)
Motherfucker let's go
Yeah-yeah, Let's go
Put your back into it like you Grandma do it, let's go
A-Town!
Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan

[Chorus] + (Big Boi)
I knew I was wrooong for thinking that she caaaared
I knew all alooong, that's whay I stay prepaaared 
{And one and two, now you know what to do}
My nigga what was I to do, but find someone elseeeeeeeeee
(Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan)

[Verse One: Big Boi]
This is how it starts
Momma fell heel over head and says you was the one
Big Boi, but she calls me Antwan
So just for fun, I went along with hon
I was young, full of cum, done for the skeet skeet, not dumb
We would meet undiscretely discrete
She in heat like beitch on a leash (BIIITCH!)
No disrespect, but metaphorically she's a beeeeast
No teasing, no whining
Just bumping and grinding til we got slimey 
Yeah, from that sweet stick thang, can't complain
I was hooked on the box like the hot Krispy Cremes

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Big Boi]
Well it didn't take long for me to game peeep
It was week after week, I was seeing the same freak
I be damned if we posing for pictures and throwing rice
Maybe throwing up in Vegas while Daddy's on the dice
I might (might) just put you on the chopping block tonight
Act right and you can get my second string spotlight
But if you freaking, I'm speaking clean as a whistle
This'll be the last offical offer before dismissal
No teasing, no whining
Just bumping and grinding til we got slimey 
Yeah, got the latex for the fit
Because she trying to +trick Daddy+, Slip-N-Slide on this dick!

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Big Boi w/ back up singers]
You are not the one, you are not the one
You can be my two, you can be my two
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
(And one and two, now you know what to do)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Big Boi]
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
Now two, now two, I'mm give her back to you
I'm through, nigga
I don had enough of the nast stuff
One, two, yeah!</pre>
