[Joe Mafia]
Rolling out, rolling up in the cut, we so plush
58 West, the rest, we cold crush
My PYT's, on the scene, trying to see Akie
I'm Joe Mafia, baby, it's popping
You got what I need, my dogs walk and my name ring
I knew you heard these birds, singing the same thing
That's me, me, always into something
Don't fake jacks, run with cats that's fronting
Team stay gully, fam keep it gutter
In the streets, well known, got it locked for the summer
Can't wait to push through in 22 drop Hummers
Team stay Crys' and haze, burberry got 'em
On the cock, round the clock on the block, we spot hopping
VA's finest, the flyest, and you can't stop 'em
We got fetti to get, that's it, no more, no less
You violate, it's the head or the chest, guaranteed

[Chorus: Joe Mafia]
58 West, we got the heat (heat)
Suffolk, Norfolk, Chesapeaq'
Bad News, P-Town and Virginia Beach
Lamping, Smithfield and Franklin, peace

[JOe Mafia]
Yo, it gets no better than this, we pop bottles of Lake
Up in shadows with some modeling chicks
Fresh from Daytona's, dollars is crisp
At the party, and the suite that we in
You got glizzy, twist it up, just flow in the Cognac
Y'all ain't leaving til six in the morning
And when you see me again, it's been again
Don't blow up my spot, cuz we both got hot
Now check, whip, chain, a little bit of change
A little bit of gain will get a little bit of brain
I show you how to do it, on the beach, front, we stunt
Hard on the boulevard, even though police front
Take it on downtown, I ride around
What's up fans, most, I post, the camp town
Pretty in pink, half a mink in the scenery
I got the globe, keep your eyes on me, feel me?

[Chorus]

[Joe Mafia]
When I slide through, son, just respect due
I know how you feel, dog, keep hating cool
It don't make me or break me, take much
To raise, up in name, let ya face see
I rather bag a bird, escape and get cake
Do shows and blow state to state
Tie Water mob, illegite, play my part, man
I ain't gotta do no more hustling and robbing
Dunkin' d's, P-North, will see worse
And bag me now, it's flies and t-shirts
My mans touching down and I'm staying sucker free
Keep your ears to the street, 2003
Blow spots, young and get that cream, lamp in the spots I be
Kill the drama, all of that, my scene
Before I learn the ends and the outs of this
And if it don't money then it ain't about its

[Chorus]</pre>
