[Hook: Down]
All the homies, they know what I mean
Baby, let me show you how I lean (Like a cholo)
Laid back
Bounce in the club
When we do a dance, and we do it like what (Like a)
Like a cholo

[Break 1: Fingazz] + (Down)
"Side to side"
"Elbows up-up"
"Side to side"
"Elbows up"
"Side to side"
"El-elbows up-up"
"Side to side" (Like a cholo)

[Down]
(Verse 1)
All up in the club
Ten deep
Lookin' for some heinas
We on the creep
I need a bad one
A real freak
Find 'em on the dancefloor
So don't sleep
Damn
I like you
I like you, but I really want her
She's that type
I can tell
Let me get
In too deep, take her back to the hotel
But right now
I'm on the move
Show this little mama how a gangsta groove
I don't do a whole lot
Just enough
Lean side to side, keep my elbows up
Like this
And like that
All the girls know where the real G's at
You can find us
Way up in the back
Watching that ass
Bounce like a low-low (I lean like a cholo)

[Break 2: Fingazz] + (Down)
"Side to side"
"Elbows up-up"
"Side to side"
"Elbows up"
"Side to side"
"El-elbows up-up"
"Side to side" (I lean like a cholo)

[Repeat Break 1]

(Verse 2)
I'm brown
I get down
The girls love
How I lean
Like a G
To the beat
Blue and MJ's on my feet
I'm lookin' real good
I'm so hood
Bout to stay clean, if you know what I mean
Pockets full of feria, mucho dinero
Look me in my eyes, told me, "Papi, te quiero"
Let me do my dance
You do yours
Shaking what you got 'til you sweating out your pores
Just like that
Yeah, I like that
I'm a perro, tryin' to chase that cat
Hey DJ
Won't you play
That same track, wind it back, I can lean to that
Now she
Wants me
And I ain't going home solo, cause (I lean like a cholo)

[Repeat Break 2 &amp; 1]

[Down]
All the homies, they know what I mean
Baby, let me show you how I lean (Like a cholo)
Laid back
Bounce in the club
When we do a dance, and we do it like what (Like a cholo)

[Repeat Hook]

[Repeat Break 2, 1 &amp; 2]

[Fingazz]
"Side to side"
"Elbows up-up"
"Side to side"
"Elbows up"
"Side to side"
"Fin-fin-fin-Fingazz on the track..."</pre>
