This is the part when we-
This is the part
This is the part when we- (what's up? - when we get 'em)
(Cha Cha niggaz) this is the part (when we stick 'em)
(Rocket) this is the when we- (when we switch 'em - flat line)
This is the part (when we ditch 'em)
This is the part when we- (when we get 'em baby)
(Holla at me) lets go!
This is how

I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em (yo Cha)
I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em (Cha, hold on Cha)
I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em (wait a minute Cha, wait 'till the beat drop)
I get 'em, I stick 'em, I switch 'em, I ditch 'em (show 'em how we hit 'em Cha)
I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em (uh huh)
I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em (hot shit)
I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em (pump this in your Jeep motherfuckers!)
I get 'em, I stick 'em, I switch 'em, I ditch 'em

[Verse one: Cha Cha]
I {*gun noise*} stick 'em
I - IIIII flick 'em
Shit 'em and switch 'em, that's how I - IIIII ditch 'em
Keys in the ignition, bounce get missin'
WE DON'T DO COMITMENTS (holla)
Hit the club, back to my mission
Same type of sippin', niggas ain't no different
It's easy pimpin' if you see us in it
Four Jeeps get (???????)
It's gold and white labels, no brads at this table
Yellow and green bottles, you know what that mean? y'allin'
Know you got to drop if you cop a skwat
This shit goes no further then the parking lot
Burns a tab (???????) back to your pad
Be lucky if a broad drop you mad to the lab
After that we stab, look backwards and laugh
take a bottle in the air
Two fingers, that's how a playa bounce

[Hook: Cha Cha: "this is how" (repeat 11X) with minor variations]

(That's how I stick 'em babe) I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em (get 'em, I stick 'em, I switch 'em, I ditch 'em)
I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em, I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em
I get 'em (uh huun)
I stick 'em
I switch 'em
I ditch 'em (that's how I stick 'em babe)
I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em (get 'em, I stick 'em, I switch 'em, I ditch 'em)
I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em, I - IIIII - IIIII - IIIII get 'em
I get 'em (uh huun)
I stick 'em
I switch 'em
I ditch 'em (that's how I stick 'em babe)

[Verse two: Cha Cha]
You might ketch me in Bahamas, when I'm loungin' wit him
Tell him bring the Condoms wit him, like he gon hit 'em
Know I always liein' a little, bullshit him
Tell his ass lye on the pillow, let him feel 'em
Pop dom wit him, and roll up (?) wit him
Create bonds wit him, but I don't wined up wit him
I just stack my cake, hair back to the states
Know it's two case, like "Oh yea, by the way..."
I'M A HUSLA BABE
And you just got played
Thanks for the trip, I just got payed
That's what you get, tryin' a hotel
Sees-po-lease
I tax for the stress when it's (?) to invest
Wynnin', we kissin' (?)
Why we can't undress?
That's when I lie
"It's not you, it's the PMS"
I reverse the game
You should rehearse the same
I always dig at your nollage
So I dig at your wallets
This is how 

[Hook] X2

[Verse three: Cha Cha]
These niggers deserve Oscars, better yet Grammies
They all sing the same damn song for the panties
From Mike, Donald and Danny, down in Miami
To Nate from Pinstate
Even California Randy
And DJ like (?) from New York and L.A.
He from around D.C. but be in V.A.
So, from Cha-City to Detroit Rock City
They all say the same lines
(???????)
Get it 

[Hook] 2X
