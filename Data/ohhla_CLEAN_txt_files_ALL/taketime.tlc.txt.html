1 -	[Chilli and T-Boz]
	Let's take our time baby
	Love lasts forever
	Over and over
	We'll love together
	Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chilli]
Come here, next to me
And let me make you high
No mistakes, we will make
A long time, we will love

Repeat 1

[Chilli]
Kiss me, hold me tight
And let's get wet tonight
Happiness is pleasing you
So let me make you cry

Repeat 1

Yeah baby, ahh
*laughs*

2 -	[Chilli and T-Boz]
	Slowly, deep inside me
	Hold me, kiss my body
	Only you can make me oh so easy
	Slowly, deep inside me
	Hold me, kiss my body
	Only you can make me oh so easy
