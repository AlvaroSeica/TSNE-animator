[Everlast]
I hear the train a comin, comin round the bend
and I ain't seen the sunshine, since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin on
But that train just keeps a rollin, on down to San Anton'
When I was just a baby my momma told me "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin, I hang my head and cry

{"How y'all feel out there?"} {"Aww yeah"} {"Check this out"}

[Everlast]
I bet there's rich folks eatin, in a fancy dinin car
They're probably drinkin whiskey, and smokin big cigars
Well I know I had it comin, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin, and that's what tortures me

{"How y'all feel out there?"} {"Aww yeah"} {"Check this out"}

[Everlast]
If they'd freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I'd probably move it just a little further down the line
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I long to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle, blow all my blues away</pre>
