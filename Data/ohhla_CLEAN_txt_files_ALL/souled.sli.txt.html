Typed by: AZ Lyrics

But hear my story
Said it's standin' true
But nobody callin' 'til i call you
Missionaries go and fight the war
But don't you hear me i say babylon fall
You know a babylon fall
You know a babylon fall
You know a babylon fall
But irie nations
Led us to
A fight for survival
That you've got to pull through
Brothers and sisters
Say you've got to stand tall
But let's unite us
'cause we've got to evolve
You know we've got to evolve
You know we've got to evolve
All i needed was a
Place to stay
Well i know my jah jah
He the only way
Through thick and thin
Or down that winding road
Fuck all that ganja buzz it's got to get sold
You know it's got to get sold
You know it's got to get sold
You know it's got to get sold
You know it's got to get sold
You know it's got to get sold
You know it's got to get sold</pre>
