[Intro - J. Cole - talking] (*echo*)
Yeah
Hmm, hmm, hey
What's up girl?
Hey, yeah, uh

[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
Angel eyes, long hair
I see you cryin, what's wrong there?
"He did what? He fucked who?"
We know the story, what's new?
See I could probably, rush you
Tell you that he should of loved you
Take advantage, fuck you
Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same
On different teams but it's all a game
The objective, tryin to score
You got a wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers
Pull up her pants, you find the door
You drive her home, she mop you off
You bust again, then drop her off
Then repeat, like an episode
Why we cheat? I'll never know
Is it 'cause we rap? Heavens no
Lot of niggaz rap, though never blow
Like hetero, sexuals
Girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be 'cause my father let me know
That he cheated and somehow, I never told? (I never told)

[Break - Conversation between father and son]
Father: Hey, you wanna be a man?
Son: Yeah, I wanna be a man
Father: A man don't run and tell his mama everything he see
Son: I ain't gonna tell
Father: Alright, al-alright then man, be a man then
Son: Alright

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Yeah, hey, okay, that's what it is, I see the game
The hoes come, the seasons change
The hoes go, we rearrange
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same
The OG's, that beat the game
Forever young, Peter Pan
Thirty-five? Still playin
Child support? Still payin
Jugglin, bill payin
Been runnin round, field dayin
Wine and dine, meal payin
With hopes that, she'll lay him
The bed and, get wet then
Give head then, you bet man
That same girl who said "we just met, man"
Game colder than the fuckin dead man
One night stands, no best man
No bridesmaids, or Reverends
'Cause Wolverine's, depressin
Don't wanna be your ex-man/X-Men
'Cause Cupid aims, and throw the darts
There go the sparks, then broken hearts
Who wanna build, Noah's Ark
Just to have that shit torn apart? (yeah)

[Outro - Conversation between man and woman]
Woman: You know what? Um, I need to talk to you
Man: About what?
Woman: I don't think is ah, workin out for us
Man: Why?
Woman: I mean, I need some space (*hiss*)
Woman: I mean no, I, I just wanna find myself, that's all
Man: What the fuck?
Woman: You know?</pre>
