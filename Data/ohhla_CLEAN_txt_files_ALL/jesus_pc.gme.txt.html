[Game]
Tell 'em pray for me
It was God that brought Dre to me
Even brought the nigga Kanye for me
Bless - but them niggaz shot Big
Made a nigga feel ashamed of the city where he live
Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap
Thinkin back to that Beamer, wish my nigga 'Pac was strapped
But I'm dreamin Las Vegas Boulevard, Afeni's son bullet scars
Everybody king of diamonds 'til the feds pull they cards
Not the deck though
Hip-Hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface and Esco
Memoirs of the gold chain
It's a cold game nigga, Johnny Coltrane
Black Versaces with the gold frame
Nigga said he sold 'caine, that's a bold claim
14 had a brain that could throw flames
So strange have to blow they mind, Cobain

[Chorus: Game] + (Kanye West)
Momma forgive me cause I'm tryna make a livin, hahh
Them niggaz hatin cause that Rolls Phantom killin, hahh
Niggaz shinin like they hangin from the ceiling, hahh
Me and 'Ye killin
(Somethin like my Jesus piece, hahh)
Lord willin, I see a billion, 'til then I let my nuts hang
(Somethin like my Jesus piece, hahh)
Throw them suicide doors up and let that Holy Ghost swang
(Somethin like my Jesus piece, hahh)

[Game]
That's that +Crack Music+ nigga
Never spit a verse cause I was makin trap music nigga
I'm not an army, I'm a movement
The flow is water, Andre tried to Ice Cube him
Ice cubin, roof translucent
Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose
When I'm talkin 'bout God, she 'posed to bow her head
Now she all on the blog, steady postin 'bout her head
Got me thinkin like a father - is the world safe?
Got me clingin to my daughter like shark fins in water
Rocks in my ears somethin Titanic
This my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it
God says everything happens for a reason
I've seen four seasons at the Four Seasons
Take that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezin
Cookin up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in

[Chorus]

[Common]
Pieces on gold leashes
Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive
Uhh, I'm the sun shinin with God features
Draw closer to a true Blood bleeder, soul of a Southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up, knowin that the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
to sacrifices we made it's sorta, Christ-like
At the afterparty thinkin what the afterlife's like
He paid for my sins, is it really priced right?
Fuck it, I see the light, +Raw+ Stacy delight
Can't deny my Jesus piece that's so, Peter-like
Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo'
A combo piece, she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel
Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow

[Chorus]</pre>
