[A.C.]
I never close the shades in my souls, windows are slept on
Like the dude that K.O. Kimbo, but I just kept on
Now I catch a flight to be civil, right out to West Palm
What happen to the life that's so simple, with all the stress gone
They say they have 'fuck you' money, but I ain't buying that
This a recession, even the bosses getting fired at
You need to hire that guy from Stat', to get your clients back
You go the bunsen burner, plus I heard he brought the science back
I attract scholars, but ya'll prefer the petty penny on the dollar
Drama starter, steady screaming holla
How selfish, you are now helpless
I'm just trying to clear my head like a Browns helmet
You scabrons calling 5-0, funny style
Friar Club cats wearing wires like FiOS
I'm bringing Staten back on a high note
Plus I eliminated all the heavy lifting like Cerato

[Chorus: Portishead "Undenied" sample (Remedy)]
Now that I've found you (hip hop, hip hop)
And seen behind those eyes (ah one-two, ah one-two)
How can I (ah yes, yes, ya'll)
Carry on (hip hop, and you don't stop)

[Remedy]
I spent my whole life chasing a dream, yo, I lusted it
Trying to get my foot in the door, I put my trust in it
Did it for the love, worked my ass off, busting it
Eat, sleep and shit hip hop, I was hustling it
They said I needed 'fuck you' money, so I got me some
It's the recession, need a cash cow, got me one
Major labels chasing the papers, that's where the blame is
Either way, it's a disgrace, look where the game is at
No more purpose, hip hop's worthless
Turned into a circus, now the game's short circuits
Hollywood gimmicks, two-faced mimics
Me and A.C. running M.C. clinics
I attract dollars, this is where it happens at
Hip hop scholars, bound to bring the Staten back
Where we go wrong, how can I remain strong?
Listen to the words in the song, and carry on, let's go

[Chorus]</pre>
