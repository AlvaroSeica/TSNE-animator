[Truck]
You see this life that I live, man, this shit is all the same
All this hurt and hunger, brings out all my pain
I thought life'll get better, but things never change
This here's a true story, the first chapter of the book
I never thought I'd be abandoned, and grow up to be a crook
Watching my moms and pops go at it, the death of my grandmother, a real life tragic
It's hard coming up when your parents are known drug addicts
Stuck in this world, with a fucking bad habit
Enough if enough, I can't take no more
The last words from my moms, she just going to the store
Three weeks later, PCW's at my door
Now I'm caught up in foster care, with no where to go
No food, no clothes, man, nothing to show
So much stress, really made it hard to sleep at night
I learned to scrap and get down, from all the group home fights
I never dealt with emotions, so we got tight
Plus his struggle was mine, and her sorta was to
So he became my best friend, she became my boo
The life of a foster child, and what I had to go through
To survive all alone, on these mean ass streets
I'm a man now, standing on my own two feet
I don't trust no one, I refuse to sleep
I'm in this game for one thing, man, playing for keeps

[Chorus 2X: Bless]
Up on these streets, on Staten Island, it's a struggle
The game is so Ruthless, I know that it's
All part of my hurt, hunger &amp; pain

[Truck]
You wanna know my hurt and hunger, you wanna feel my pain
You wanna know why this Bastard shit flows through my veins
You wanna hear how I sold crack, to put myself in the game
Yeah I'm in it for the money, man, fuck all the fame
The hype and glitter about whose better and bigger
Just cut me a check so I can go back to the hood with my niggas
Cuz we never had nothing and we probably never will
It's cool I keep spitting, until I get that deal
Keep telling you how it is, how the fuck I feel
Talk about situations, always keeping it real
This one' isfor the crews, gangs and sets
I'm the next thing coming, man, quiet as kept
Out of all 5 boroughs, Staten Island was slept
Ruthless is on they job, I got faith, we gon' make it now
Videos, tours, interviews, I'm gonna take it now
All the funny looks and rumors, I see them hating now
These streets is a struggle, every day I got to hustle
If you ain't about your business, then they ain't gonna love ya
It's a new generation, every hood got skills
Every rapper in the game got a story to tell
Every nigga wit a dream got a product to sell
But why you fucking with the streets if they can't post bail
I don't trust no one, I refuse to sleep
I'm in this game for one thing, man, playing for keeps

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 2X: Bless]
Yo, no matter where you are, and no matter what you do
You better be on they P's and Q's, you ain't invincible
So do what you gotta do, and hustle to make it through
Cuz yo the only person that's responsible for you

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
