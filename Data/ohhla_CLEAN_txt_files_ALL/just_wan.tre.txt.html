[Intro/Chorus]
Can you listen baby
I know that it might sound crazy
But, I just wanna cut
And, yes I gotta lady
But girl you driven me so crazy
Cut, make me wanna cut

[Trey Songz]
Baby girl this the prince of Virginia
When I say that I'm tryin to get in ya
I ain't tryin to be to dramatic, but your ass is past the average
Ooo the way that you movin ya waist, so fat and a beautiful face
Ooo girl I gotta have ya
And don't say no, that ain't the answer
Put your legs all up in the air
Twist from the back and pull your hair, ooo baby girl let's take it there
I'll tell you girl I'm so prepared
Just let me freak ya body, cause youse a freaky shorty
Them tig' ol whats and that big ol' butt
Hirl I'm tryin to get a you know what

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Baby it's the things that you do when you do what you do
Oh babe, make me wanna cut
It's the way that you move there is nothing to do
Make me wanna cut
Mama right here on this floor
I gotta let you know
The way you drop it low
Ooo girl I'm gettin swoll
Just let me take you home
Do what I know is wrong
And once we get along, baby, I'm gonna sing this song
Put your legs all up in the air
Twist from the back and pull youur hair, ooo baby girl let's take it there
I'll tell you girl I'm so prepared
Just let me freak ya body, cause youse a freaky shorty
Them tig' ol whats and that big ol' butt
Hirl I'm tryin to get a you know what

[Chorus]

[Trey Songz]
Baby it's the things that you do
When you do what you do
It's the way that you move there is nothing to do
Make me wanna cut
And when I twist it baby
I swear the girls up in this club tonight
It ain't a problem
We don't need any room baby
And what make it special
It's just as soft and round`
I gotta let you know

[Chorus]</pre>
