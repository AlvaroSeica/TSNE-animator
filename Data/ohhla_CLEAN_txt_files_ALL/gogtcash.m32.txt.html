(*talking*)
Yeah uh, outta there
He's outta there, he's outta there
He's outta there, he's outta there

[Mr. 3-2]
I live my life, on the edge
Up's and down's, out here getting big heads
I'ma step on toes, step on necks for mine
Climb the latter, keep money on my mind
No time, I got licks from out of town
Stang, send em home breaking it down
Broads, wanna be on team with a boss
Nina Ross, I roll with whatever it cost
Shocking and rocking, feeling really good
Mama give you a dollar, girl I wish I would
I'm a pimp mack player, with some game for a broad
Coming out hard, baby I don't barre

[Hook - 2x]
Gon' work it, go get cash
I twerk it, because I'm getting it fast
So mash, like it ain't no tomorrow
Count it up, while y'all beg and borrow

[Mr. 3-2]
People tell me, have some faith
I ain't got no patience, no time to wait
For the bread, cause I need it like yesterday
No bread, then baby boy can't go play
These breezies, wanna get up in my pocket
I knock down move around, tell em to stop it
No tricking, lose em in the words I use
Now baby, putting on here choosing shoes
This world, got so many ways to get paid
Just jump in the mix, and never can be afraid
Day for day, playing it like a routine
Checking my traps, and counting up big green
I'm a fiend, for that smell of new money
Gotta get fed, get bread in my tummy
Dummies confused, with they mind messed up
I stay calling shots, and I ain't been touched
What it is, yeah it's Fatt Domino
Put the roof lay back, in the click fo' do'
Turning corners, hitting blocks on these streets
Everybody give it up, to a real true beast

[Hook - 2x]

[Mr. 3-2]
New year new thangs, I'm cutting my ties
If you ain't affiliated, gon' head and ride
Don't check my mission, cause I'm on a roll
Hit the ground running baby, with some'ing to fold
It's popping all night, I'm off the hook
Going through these books, and the laws get shook
Crooks like me, always looking for licks
Fools looking all breezy, cause the spot got hit
Take a loss, yeah it's all a part of the game
Come right back up, and triple my change
Hustling, stang for stang I'm winning
Been like that, since the beginning
Rolling, keeping the block on fire
Networking, getting chips out the wire
No liar, really cause it's nothing but real
Got too many ways, for me to get scrill

[Hook - 2x]</pre>
