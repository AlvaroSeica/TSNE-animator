[Chorus]
I know lately that we ain't did much

You gon always be mine
And I'ma stretch my time we gon make thangs rite

And I'ma beat that pussy up beat that pussy up
girl I'ma beat that pussy up until you holla that's enough

[Verse 1]
I walked outside look I'm tired of this mane
my cutie in tha yard wit my draws in her hand
my girl looked at me n said
"YOU DOG ASS NIGGA FINNA PUT THIS KNIFE N YO MUFUCKIN LIVER"
I couldnt say shit had to leave the house
she punched me in my shit all I did is walked off because I'm wrong
but 2nite when she go home I'ma keep callin her phone
