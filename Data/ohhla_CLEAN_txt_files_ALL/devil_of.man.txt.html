Song:   Devil of a Town
Typed by: @ManteyeMusic

I hear the ashpalt's layed down fresh on mainstreet
And the kids are already puttin' their little footprints down
And the angels are dressed to the nines
It's quite a sight to see
But not until those bad boys come around
And there's a little house up on first ave
Where the party has already started
So saddle up your pick-up trucks
This ain't no social life for the faint hearted

[Chorus]
It's a Devil of a town
Devil of town yea
Devil of a town
Devil of town yea

And the motels are never empty, there's a room if you need it
And the mayor he's got a monthly bill that, he don't talk about
So if you've got a ring on your finger
Don't worry cause it don't mean much
Soon enough those bad boys will come around
And the church is never full on sunday
Cause there ain't no social life for the faint hearted

It's a Devil of Town
Devil of town yea
Devil of a town
Devil of town yea
It nothing but a devils town yea
Repeat Chorus
Nothing but a devils town</pre>
