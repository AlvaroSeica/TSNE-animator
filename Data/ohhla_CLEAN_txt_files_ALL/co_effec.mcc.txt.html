Talking 'bout math, math, I love math
Gettin my books for school, math...
(Wait a minute, math? MATH?!)
(Hey, what the fuck are you doing over there, you little GEEK?)
Oh, don't hit me
(You were just jabbering about math?)
(What is these, math books? There they go! HAHAHAHAHAHA~!)
Oh you knocked the books out of my hands!
I gotta pick them up now
I gotta get to... I gotta get to class
(Hey, you like math, do you?)
Yeah, I like math
(I got a practical math application for you) Oh
(Yeah, your face plus my fist plus, uh)
(something that I'm gonna shove up your asshole) No!
(divided by pi, the co-efficient)
Ahhhh! Oh oww! You're hurting me!
Oh, this is so painful!
(Shut up! If you think this is painful)
(meet me in the boys bathroom at two o'clock) No
(and then I'll show you painful)
Oh God {*crying*}
One day, I'm gonna show him</pre>
