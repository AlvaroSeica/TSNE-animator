[Chorus]
Girl, girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
Girl got a fat old ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, and make it till that bitch just dance
Girl got a fat old ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, and make it till that bitch just dance

[Verse 1]
Dance, too much booty in the pants
Called eye contact like she knew me in the past
Ass so fat just dropped my glass
Ass so fat nigga couldn't run it past
Latino mommy super think got no tats
Told her when she go black wont go back
Baby girl have fun don't hold back
Cuz when you get old that booty might go flat
Educated, paid nigga and from the hood
She need a real nigga that can do something to her
Nah, she just want a nigga that stunt good
She got back but I wonder if the front good
We at the pool party, she got bikini on
Shut the whole party down, had to bring her home
She choosin' she on me like a tattoo
And all the home girls got ass too

[Chorus]
Girl got a fat old ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, and make it till that bitch just dance
Girl got a fat old ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, and make it till that bitch just dance

Let me see you drop it, don't stop it
Let me see you drop it, don't stop it
Bring it up what, don't stop
Bring it up what, don't stop
Drop it to the floor what, don't stop
To the floor what, don't stop
Let me see you drop that, don't stop yeah
Bounce that ass, don't stop bitch

[Verse 2]
From the neck up its amazing
From the neck down eyebrow raising
She killin' all the girls on world star
She wanna be on TV be a world star
She in VIP gettin' it
You can hear that ass clap when she gettin' it
How you sink like that I'm not gettin' it
I'm in the zone thinkin' bout hittin' it
That ass took over the whole club
Somebody hold my drink I'm in love
I just wanna walk up to her and give it a hug
You might as well come soccer to the plug
Fuck the bullshit I'm tryna get insider her
Them high heels make them asses a little higher
Met her tonight in this club lets get married here
And when she walk this booty everywhere

[Chorus]
Girl got a fat old ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, and make it till that bitch just dance
Girl got a fat old ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, old girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, and make it till that bitch just dance

Let me see you drop it, don't stop it
Let me see you drop it, don't stop it
Bring it up what, don't stop
Bring it up what, don't stop
Drop it to the floor what, don't stop
To the floor what, don't stop
Let me see you drop that, don't stop yeah
Bounce that ass, don't stop bitch</pre>
