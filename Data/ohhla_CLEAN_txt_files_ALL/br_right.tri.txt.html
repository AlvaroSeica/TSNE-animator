[Trina]
Wait bitch I'ma blow my kisses
Get pissed and throw my dishes
Y'all niggaz know just who this is
WHOO! WHOO! and the head so viscious
With me this shit gone cost
You short than thats your loss
You know this ass is soft
Make a nigga go to breaking off
Tell me that you love me baby
And get high and fuck me crazy
Get a towel and wipe me off
You want a bitch with no type of flaws
My girls be shopping hard
These hoes be buying cars
In the club buying bars
Nipples hard is a sign of bras
All my niggaz who getting cheese
Throwback and the crispy G's
Moet, Cris on freeze
laugh at a tab cuz this on me
Me and Luda in a cut supreme
Doing things just to touch the creme
So many names wanna fuck the Queen
I live a life like its just a dream
UH!

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Hit it right behind JUMP!
Give me the beat then I'ma make it bump
Tell me what you wanna hear damn yes it can
Trouble with your man I'ma pop my trunk
You aint seen no chicks like mine
You aint seen no flips like mine
Gonna make you (UGH!) next to the subwoofers in my 6 by 9
Tell me that you like it raw
Tell me that my dick is WAAH!
I might make you famous and buy you watches by Maurice Lacroix
Tell me if it's new or old
Tell me if its hot or cold
Let me know if it's black and bold
Say Ludacris 6 million sold
See I ain't got no time for games
And I ain't got no time for lames
How you loving my Southern slang....
OOH-EEH-WATTA-WATTA-BING-BANG
So anytime you need me call
Winter summer spring or fall
It doesn't matter come one come all
Either get dropped or drop them drawls

[Chorus]

[Trina]
Diamond - Princess
Just mind your business
These rumors are senseless
Your whispers are endless
We living ghetto fab
We spending hella cash
This girl is hella bad
Your choice is trailer trash
Too much taste for whores
You saw me grace The Source
You watched me work the Vibe
Bitches I works for mine
One time for these divas
Two times for these Visa's
Third time I come I'm breezing
The ice just keeps on freezing
Hold up I'ma keep it going
Back to back I'ma keep on blowing
Platinum plaques keeping it up
Wet Saks keeping it gut
Look girl you don't know my angle
A hundred thou on a platinum bangle
My niggaz will slow your roll
Pussy power we in control

[Chorus]

[Trina]
YO! That's right I'm back again
Round two motherfuckers that's right
I'm talking greasy
I'ma arrogant lil' motherfucker huh?
That's right I'm rich I'm that bitch (That's right)
I'm bout to show y'all how to pimp this shit
I'm fucking niggaz in the face
The game is mine 2003 fuck that
Fuck all y'all haters fuck all y'all bitches, get a life
You got too much times on your hands
I want y'all bitches to get a job
Up your game pimp your game up baby
It's all about me this time fuck that
Fuck a dime I'ma silver dolla- HOLLA!
Catch me when I come off tour fuck y'all
I'm out</pre>
