[Intro]
Ever wanted to shoot your best friend in the face
and get away with it?
Presenting "KillCount," available now at your favorite video game retailer
The only game where your street, your block, even your house
is the war zone - no one is safe
Rated M for Mature

[Random]
It's the illest game I ever seen
It's like it dropped straight out of my wildest dreams
My regime is full of killers who dyin to get the scrilla
And if you are not familiar we ridin and peelin ya
The realism is out of control
Shoot a dude close up and the blood stains your clothes
And oh! It's modeled after where I live
So when I gotta get away the safehouse is my crib
Ya dig? I played the game for seven hours
and I'm only six percent through - I ain't tryin to hit the showers
or devour a meal all day I ain't makin it to school!
Mr. J'll understand, man we cool
I got online, fired on my man's crib, then he shot on mine
And it was ill
He put a bomb under my momma's Prius
Detonated it when I was tryin to re-up
And this is how it's 'sposed to be
When the coward come close to me
Had to shoot him in his ear, put his brains upon my upholstery
That's when I got a call from my man Jamal
Tellin me it was a shootout at the Westfield Mall
What was ironic was, the crime scene
looked exactly like game level did when I shot it
Something's goin on - who's gonna investigate?
Not me - I'm still tryin to beat section 8
"KillCount" boy!</pre>
