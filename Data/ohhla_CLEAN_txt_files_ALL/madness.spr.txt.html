Song:   Madness in Tha hood (Free Ride)
Typed by: dave@isy.liu.se

Ooh Ohh take a chance on a free ride
Ooh Ohh take a chance on a free ride free ride
Ooh Ohh take a chance on a free ride
Ooh Ohh take a chance on a free ride free ride

Madness in tha hood keeps trying to kill the vibes
even gam's preacher packs a 45
run get the chalice and posse up the tribe
and with the love of Rastafari we shall never die

Wake up in the morn unlock the store pops
hookers on Leavenworth closin' up shops
cops, lookin' like a blind Cyclops 'cause
they clockin' ten percent
of the CREAM off the top
got mad money comin' down the pipe
from the three piece suit who gotta piece last night
the butcher the backer phony credit card maker
plus the operation being sponsored by Jamaica
and then there's the dimea dozen hoodie hitmen
who be killin' for sport, they go kids to support
Slingin' dice come cross the snake eyes
come and take a chance on a free ride

(Chorus)
Badi ah-dee adi ah
come and take a chance on a free ride
Badi ah-dee adi ah
come and take a chance on a free ride
Ooh Ohh take a chance on a free ride
(Madness in tha hood keeps tryin' a kill the vibes)
Ooh Ohh take a chance on a free ride
(And with the love of Rastafari we shall never die)

Like Gregory Hines I return to the dance, (dancin'?)
broadcast vast audio radiance, enhance
wave hands, shake pants as I commence
DJ wheel up drop bass then advance
I get reactions just like Johnny Cochran
when he compared Mark Fuhrman to that old German
listen Herman Munster was a gangsta
S.F.P.D. shield on his clothes gave up the answer
to the crack freak just released from the jail
twenty in his pocket waitin' to inhale
takes deep breath from the piss stinkin' air
past the drag queen wearin' other people's hair
she snaps, "What you think you lookin' at here you look
like Jimmy Walker wearin' Biggy Small's gear
Get the fuck away before I make you disappear
I don't play that freaky shit do I make myself clear." 

(Chorus)
Badi ah-dee adi ah
come and take a chance on a free ride
Badi ah-dee adi ah
come and take a chance on a free ride
Ooh Ohh take a chance on a free ride
(Madness in tha hood keeps tryin' a kill the vibes)
Ooh Ohh take a chance on a free ride
(And with the love of Rastafari we shall never die)</pre>
