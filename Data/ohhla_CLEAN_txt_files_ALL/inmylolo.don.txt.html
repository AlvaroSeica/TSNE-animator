Chorus: Krook
Come on over
Take a ride with me
In my low low
We can supply
Anything you need
If you wanna go
I will fulfill
All your fantasies
So just let me know
If you want
We got it, cause you need it
Baby

[Verse 1: Don Cisco]
Let me explore your fantasies, all your deep dark secrets
Roll in back streets with me, park it and peep it
I adore it when you sport, your Victoria's Secret
Told me you got love for me, then show me when you stop creepin'
I stopped, hoppin' at freaks
Freelancin' on the weekends
Gettin' lap dances from the Puerto Ricans (Strip clubs)
I'm, Spanish speakin', of the Spanish Harlem
To East L.A., to the Bay, it ain't no problem
Girl, you can't deny, I'm worldwide with this (What)
From the, Pacific coast to the Atlantic mist
I'm bi-coastal, rock the globe like I'm supposed to (Worldwide)
International player that the squares can't get close to
Me and Frosty loco, dippin' in the low-low
Flossin' like a boss whether I'm deep or slow
Keep heat fo sho though, got the drank and do-do
Big bank west side (Baby)
Hop into my low-low

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Frost]
I heard you claimed to be a rider, but man, I gotta warn you
You need to bend a couple of corners in California
Underneath the palm trees on the sunset strip
Blowin' bomb weed as I break gas, dip {*inhale, exhale*}
I dedicate this to them bald headed locos
All my homeboys, dippin' in the low-low
See all my friends, roll lowriders
Even big body Benz got low pro tires
Chrome wires
On everything we drivin'
From bikes, to cars, to trucks, I'm ain't lyin'
You catch me flyin' up the highway (Yeah)
Doin' ninety with ya breezy right behind me
On the way to the honeycomb hideout
Playboy bunnies hop in when I slide out
Time out, until we meet again
And next time, mama, you can bring your friend (What)

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Don Cisco]
Just sit your tush on my leather, ma (Come on, baby)
Touch the woodgrain
I push a hundred thousand dollar off a good game
I should claim I'm a player by nature (You know)
A natural born hustler, it's a must I touch paper (Big faces)
Playmaker, when I'm makin' moves
I got all eyes on me, like I'm breakin' rules (Don Cisco)
Mama, let's take a cruise, through the bully of the back streets
Strapped with a fully for them fools tryin' to jack me (Roll with me)
Sucker free to the fullest
Yeah, I'm a Frisco John (Know my stylo)
Dodgin' L.A. bullets
Hell yeah, I'm a rider (Hell yeah)
It's that west coast life, but can't nobody do it liver (Dubs up)
Pull all nighters and toast champagne
Blowin' on trees, rollin' in the fast lane {*blowing*}
With a Caravana love from a Caravana thug (Mosh, come on)
Dippin' low-low, sittin' on dubs

Repeat Chorus</pre>
