[Chorus - 2x]
I'm a self made millionaire
Guard your shit, so hard you sleep
I'm a self made millionaire
Now I pop bottles with models

[Z-Ro]
Ever since my early teens, I been a loc on these streets
The gold is 4-2-4, I go for broke on these streets
My flow is a young Mike Tyson, when he hit on niggaz
And even when I'm cottonmouth, I still spit on niggaz
No super friends, I smoke purple stuff alone in my room
That kush made me leave my body, I was gone in my room
Had swangas to monoblocks, I switch cars like socks
Might be in something with the roof missing, or a hard white top
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes
Now what they spend on a house, I blow on designer glasses
Even without a platinum plaque, but this ain't capping
Just telling you what my life like, so this ain't rapping
Don't make me yell and tell the captain, if my money ain't right
Might have to pay money to spray money, cause money ain't right
Now go for broke with no bodies, so I can stand on these streets
Without no army behind me, cause I'm the man on these streets

[Chorus - 3x]

[Z-Ro]
I did some time locked down, but now I'm back on these streets
Here to save y'all, from all this whack rap on these streets
I left y'all with "I'm Still Livin", proving I wasn't dead
If y'all wonder why I'm out early, my lawyer got his bread
Much love to my industry homies, who didn't forget about me
Paul Wall, Pimp C and my partna Fliperacci
And since I do bidness with Rap-A-Lot, the feds watch me
But I'm like Shaq up under the backboard, they can't stop me
When I was hustling, the police couldn't find a rock near me
Now that I ain't hustling, they can see all of my rocks clearly
These boulders ain't for smokers, these are for Joseph
They get you in the club free, and make women wanna get closer
Look homie don't get it twisted, cause you see me on a poster
You disrespect me, the magnum come out the holster like it's 'spose to
Then roll off in a Rolls Royce, and leave ya laying on these streets
Hate me I don't give a fuck, cause I'm the man on these streets
I'm a hitman, whatever I'm aiming at I hit man
After I hit her, she can't stand up without a kickstand
Not a special kind of fool, just hit her with the mule
Yeah she fine, but if she set me up I'll hit her with the tool
I got a daughter to raise, I ain't trying to leave
Plus all this money I'm making, you think I ain't trying to breathe
Inhale exhale, now that's better
Sold eight hundred thousand independent, now that's cheddar

[Chorus - 6x]</pre>
