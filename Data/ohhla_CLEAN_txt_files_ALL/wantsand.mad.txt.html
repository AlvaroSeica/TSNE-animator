[Skillz]
Now we all got the need for greed, don't front
Then you're seperatin your needs from your wants
Cause if you knowin the game
You know a need and a want is two totally different thangs
Like - we need the good life - but we don't wanna work for it
We need Jesus - but won't go to church for him
Need an answer? Raise your hand for it
Need change? Well you might wan' stand up for it
Want somethin to grow? Plant that seed
Cause the change won't come until you do that deed
Needs are for the future, wants are what your past fo'
And what you need ain't always what you ask fo'
So let the past go, and see what's greater
You know you need it so you better love your haters
Follow these rules and you up to speed
It's normal to want, but never forget what you need - aight?!

[Chorus]
We want what we want
We want what we see
We want so much that we forgot what it is
We want what we want
We want what we see
Is it the greed or is it that we live in poverty?

[Skillz]
We chase that American dream
'til we old and we out of steam
Tryin to get all the shiny things
So they be like OH MY GOD
So busy tryin to live like stars
Tryin to cop them mansions and cars
They gettin theirs so you better get yours
Then we forget what we workin for
Ha~! It's got a ring to it, don't it
You don't need to put your damn sho' on it
And right now we livin for the moment
But if we wanted the moment, we could really own it
I got dreams now watch what it's taking
We got to rock y'all stop being lazy
We want the same thing, I can admit it
But do you want it bad enough to get it?

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Just know (we want, we want, we want)
We want - what (we want, we want, we want)
We want - and (we want, we want, we want)
But we don't even know, what we need

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
