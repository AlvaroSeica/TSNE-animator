(Infinte, enough
Not again, come on, come on
Gotta go, fo' sure, fo' sure
I can't move, can you look it down?
Lift it up, move out, move out
Prob'ly can't, come on, come on
Closer, 'cause I'm out, I'm out
I'm leavin', you know I'm leavin)

People tight like spandex
Thought I was the man next
After the badge who submitted
Got locked down
Baby knocked down all the walls
That led straight to Ohio
The heart of it all and place
Where I started to fall
She had a body of heaven or hell
I can't tell
'Cause her ass say 'Hey!'
But her smile say 'What?' (Say what?)
Cut to the chase
That I never could catch
Just gettin' caught up
In soft skin and hard luck
(Stuck) in between tryin' to stick
And makin' my pick
Feelin' more like a brick
As every day went by
I would try to let her know
But she knew how to play
Those love games, drive a man insane
Deceitful plain Jane
Had me swingin' like Tarzan
When I fell off the vine
Man she had no shame
And flip you out like flat tires
When she tried to gas me
Buyin' buckets and bottles
Puttin' the throttle to the metal
I was stuck pickin' petals
(Like 'she loves me, she loves me not)
But in the end
She just blew up my spot
(Mad aim)
Thinkin' if we were together
Then she'd prob'ly try to change me
And not go crazy, but I'm crazy anyway
('Cause she loves me not)
This is the getaway scene
It's time to plot and scheme
To find another feem
To be down with my team
'Cause this one shatterd my dreams
It doesn't matter, it seems
Like she was never there
Heart breaker

Yeeeeah.....

[Verse 2]
Used to feel like heaven
When I tickled her spot
From the age of eleven to nine
(Felt to mine)
I was shut like blinds to the ways of ladies
I couldn't remember
(Of all my letters she's the main sender)
Puttin' strain on levels of my life didn't happen
Tappin' into me
Seein' that hurt was all supposed to be
And was it possible that she got way too close to me?
'Cause in my face and under my nose
Were things I didn't see
But were my eyes open?
Was my wakin' up to my crib (smokin' and flamin')?
For these types of things there's no containment
So the moments of meditation got longer, deeper
Wonderin' if I would (leave her), if I should (keep her)
My sister told me I should never be a thrill seeker
Shorty knew me way back when I used to boost sneakers
Connected like a hand and wrist to stay stiff
Lookin' in her eyes always took me on a strange trip
Plus the words that she spoke seemed true
When she said 'I dreamt of you'
Who knew that 'you' wasn't me?
Puttin' images in the mind is just a possibility
And my emotional state began to slowly fluctuate
(I found letters)
On how she loved some other cat better
And it got explicit (internal organs felt twisted)
I knew from the beginnin' but somethin' said 'risk it'
Like the mention of the name
If you're never injured, no pain, right?

(Infinte, enough
Not again, come on, come on
Gotta go, fo' sure, fo' sure
I can't move, can you look it down?
Lift it up, move out, move out
Prob'ly can't, come on, come on
Closer, 'cause I'm out, I'm out
I'm leavin', you know I'm leavin)
