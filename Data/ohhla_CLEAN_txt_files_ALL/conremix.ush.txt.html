[Woman] Hey
 
[Usher] Hey what's up?
 
[Woman] Is that you?
 
[Usher]
Yea, listen
Baby, I know we said its best that we don't talk no more
But I gotta get it off my chest, I caught the shit I been hearing babe
I, I thought you were that ride or die, the one who would never leave my side
Only made you out to be the only woman that I would be with for life
I tooked in your kid, did everything that you wanted me to
I'm hearing shit 'bout you frontin' on radio and news
Do it make you feel good to lie, eventhough whenever you want to cry?
If you gonna tell it to me, should have told everything instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say then don't say nothing
Cause if I really start talking, then it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated, so be it we need to leave it alone
Move on, you got it, hold on...
 
[Operator]
Hello, you have a collect call from Clinton Correctional Facility
Will you accept the charges?
 
[Usher]
Yes, I'll accept it. What's up?
 
[Shyne - rapping on the phone]
Sittin in my cell, had to buck to buck some
Would it be allowed if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
Would I be here today if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walking on this earth is
At night, I would've gotten murdered
If I ain't grab the hatchet and let them cowards have it
 
[J.D.]
Uh, listen up listen up listen up world
listen up listen up listen up world, uh, I gotta confess
this is the hottest remix I ever did in my life, so so def
 
[Chorus - Usher]  (J.D.)
These are my confessions, just when I thought I said all I can say
my chick on the side, said she got one on the way (yea)
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions
 
[J.D. - Talking]
If you got something to confess to right now step to the mic Twista
 
[Twista]
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus Coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While havin' women on the side
But I never knew it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson
If you stay wit' me then it'll be a blessin' no stressin'
It'll never be no guessin'
Cause I pulled one out my heart and these are my confessions
 
[Chorus - Usher]  (Kanye West)
These are my confessions, just when I thought I said all I can say
my chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what yo do
I guess i gotta give part two of my confessions
If I gotta tell it, then I'm gonna tell it all (all yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed, and I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions
 
[Kanye West]  (J.D.)
Yea Kanye to the College Dropout (Kanye confess to the people man)
Man, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic, dawg slow down that's yo child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gona tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous you can't go nowhere 'cause everytime you go there
There's hoes there so basically you and your girl are over
I know when she broke the news you told her "man, don't say that"
Matter fact like Pat don't +Sajack+ (say jack)
Everytime a nigga sittin' on paychecks
Things come up from way way way back {Echoes}
 
[Chorus - Usher]
These are my confessions, just when I thought I said all I can say
my chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I gotta tell it, then I'm gonna tell it all
Damn near cried when I got the phone call
I'm so throwed, and I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions
 
[Outro until fade - Usher talking]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
Just to tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career, this ain't about my life
It's about us, please</pre>
