[Trey Songz]
Hey, oh
High heels on
Hair did
Can't no other woman rock a dress like this
Body bangs
Doing her thing
She the only reason for the song I sing
And I wish I could be there
When she get ready for
Dancing in the mirror and talking on the phone
Telling all her home girls
What she putting on
They already know she putting on

Coz when she hit the club
Heads turn around
She living it up
Drink up in the club
I'm in love from afar
Baby girl I wanna be where you are
Where you are
Baby girl I wanna be where you are
Where you are
Girl I wanna be where you are

Should I make a move
Or should I fall back
Let you do what you do
See in you in the song
I ain't trying kill the groove
Know you turning down all them other dudes
But I
Ain't nothing like them, oh no
Can't fight the feeling
Girl I wanna know about you, yeah
Baby don't you get me wrong, no
But I've been watching you so long

Coz when she hit the club
Heads turn around
She living it up
Drink up in the club
I'm in love from afar
Baby girl I wanna be where you are
Where you are
Baby girl I wanna be where you are
Where you are
Girl I wanna be where you are

Are you here from one of dreams
Cause I don't want to ruin this fantasy
To take the chance
And you don't wanna be mine
But you gotta be in my heart
Girl I'm coming over to you
I'll put my pride to the side
But I wanna leave with all your love

I just wanna be here
Where you are
Baby girl I wanna be where you are
Where you are
Please don't deny me
Baby girl I wanna be where you are
Where you are
Baby girl I wanna be where you are
Where you are
Girl I wanna be where you are
Where you are
Baby girl I wanna be where you are

Coz when she hit the club
Heads turn around
She living it up
Drink up in the club
I'm in love from afar
Baby girl I wanna be where you are
Where you are
Baby girl I wanna be where you are
Where you are
Girl I wanna be where you are

I'll go where you go
I want to be where you are
Wherever you go
Girl I'll go there
I'll prepare
I'll go
Baby I'll go
That's all I think of</pre>
