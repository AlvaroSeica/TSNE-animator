Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Dom Pachino]
You know what I'm saying? Yeah...
I'm through with this shit, yo (bout to hurt somethinng)
Yeah, yo...

[Dom Pachino]
What's ya position and I'm posted with goggles and toast
My vest hold the most ammo, commando's take notes
What's the scandal, I strangle and mangle your folks
I'm dope uncut, never get stepped on
I rep strong, kevlaar and tephlon, the ex-con
Run laps on tracks like Rocky
My theme music be di-deh, ya fags can't stop me
Papi gave me a brick on cosignment, he love my rhyming
I flipped it, tripped it, shipped it, I'm grinding
Reminding him of him in his prime in short timing
Don't forget, that the clock don't stop
So don't take a break, shake and snake
Yo, I'm a like an earthquake, typhoon, tsunami
But it's the kid from Napalm, Killarmy el grande
Magnific when I speak, so street on the beat
Make you leak from the heat, lay you down like concrete

[Chorus 2X: Dom Pachino]
What's ya position and, I'm posted on the block
What's ya position and, I'm holding down the spot
What's ya position and, Terrorist shit, Terrorist shit
They really don't want it, son

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, check the punchline, it's lunch time, I eat your food, dunny
Tell you a Staten Island tale, like my name was Sonny
Use my head to get money, step out of the country
With my duns from the P's, that stay on hungry, grungy
My tongue spit lungies, run from amongst me
If you not brethren, I bring pain that Excedrin couldn't relieve
Please breath easy, please believe me, cock and squeezy for sheezy
My steeze and stature won't match ya, and plus degrees
You lucky if I let you fuck with me
Make green the American dream, I gotta live comfortably

[Chorus 2X]

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, like a seed in a pot, I grow, watch me blow
Lots of flows, slide on the scene like Mop-N-Glow
Lots of dough, rocks and foes, cops oppose
Lock and load, far from aiming so you can spot this pro
Don't wanna hear me out? Then the glock explode
A head banger like rock &amp; roll, take a stroll with this S.I.N.Y., official
I won't say peace, to the game, cuz the game won't miss you
And if you try to come back, they won't reinlist you
Unless you hotter than the strap, straight out the barrel of a pistol...

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
