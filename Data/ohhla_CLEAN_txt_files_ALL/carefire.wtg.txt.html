[Kung Fu Sample]
We are watchin you open it
	Careful, careful, careful, careful

[Kardinal Offishall]
Eh yo, somethin in the Dot went (BOOP BOOP)
Uh-huh, The T-Dot went (BOOP BOOP)
Eh yo, somethin in the Dot went (BOOP BOOP)
Word up, The T-Dot went (BOOP BOOP)
Let's go..

Yo, yo, eh yo, yo..

[Kardinal Offishall]
(FIRE) on the government, (FIRE) 'pon Babylon
(FIRE) 'pon the corrupted land on which we walkin on
Ice grills melt into a puddle in the struggle
Niggaz try to bust back but get jooked by undercovers
You wonder why so many niggaz out there sellin crack
because police allow that, they add it to they paper stacks
Eh yo, people are you ready? (BOOP) Are you really ready? (BOOP)
Many need to know about the ghettos in the T-Dot
Oh, the news people try to pretty-up the scene
My peoples gettin killed out there, seen? (Seen)
None of y'all niggaz can't talk about peace
When there's Palestine youths throwin rocks at police
In the streets we talk shit, a lot of young punks with guns
With dollars while the ghetto youths have no funds
The devils in this world always dress-up as nuns
Kardinal Offishall Firestarter Volume One
Careful..

[RZA]
Wait, hold up, chill, what's that son?
Damn nigga got fuck shit, huh?
The God stack, watch nigga run
Seven in the center of your eight point sun
Old type grip on the Guard U, Now you
best be Careful, can't dodge two
Self-heats aimed at your dome piece
Father U C King police

[U-God]
Somethin in the slum went rum pu-pum-pum
Somethin in the slum went rum pu-pum-pum

[Masta Killa]
Yo Rae it's been a long time son
Since we bust gun, clap Glaciers
Ran the world and snatched paper
Return to the 36th Chamber
Proceed with caution as you Enter
We have an APB on an emcee Killa
Looks like the work of a Masta

[Cappadonna]
Somethin in the street went bang, bang
Makin it hard for you to do your thang, thang
Somethin in the street went bang, bang
Up in the force game, wildin money for grabs
I ain't fuckin with crabs, outta state
Cop two labs, hop two cabs, back on the Av.
Stab you with the vocab, catch me at the big dopey head
Tryin to re-up, keep my feet up, snake niggas in the cut
Hold the pride up, your time is up
No love, heat start to bust, niggas you can't trust
Deal with lust, seen him at the ball games with James
Somethin in the street went bang, bang
Makin it hard for you to do your thang, thang
Somethin in the street went bang, bang
Makin it hard for you to do your thang, thang

[Ghostface Killah]
Somethin in the hood went click, click
The box cutter went click, click
Somethin in the hood went click, click
The box cutter went click, click
These are the bones, bones from the grave
Yo, Hoodini, G-Dini, rhymes only, Noodles sprinkle throw yo Embry
Climb like the deficit, profits, death threats to Israel
Slid through Bethlehem, bong on one wheel
Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the sixties
Granddaddy Caddy, was coppin six g's
B'Gosh all that, Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champele, brown paper bag, wall to wall pumpin

[U-God]
Beats in the camera guys, cause terror in ya eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly, Ways of the Samurai
News flash bulletin, Gods on the prowl
We full again, rough men, scuffed Timb's
Sonic bionic lens, RZA console
Is it Bush or is it Dole?, front row at the Super Bowl
Black gold in my soul, on the whole, stroll
Don't go boy, you on parole, you don't know?

[Inspectah Deck]
Someone in the back went clack, clack
Money is stacked, now bust ya gun clack, clack
Someone in the back went clack, clack
Money is stacked, now bust ya gun clack, clack
Made 'em throw they hands up and then lay flat
Rap pack, eat up, the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact, when we contact
Known to drop facts that crack your hard hat
Must I Show N Prove? Trust I, bust I
Make your head spin like chrome 20's on the Buggy Eye
Benz, who contends? Wu like the Super Friends
Who's Your Rhymin Hero? Wu-Tang rules again
Someone in the back went clack, clack
Money to stack, now bust ya gun clack, clack
Someone in the back went clack, clack
Money to stack, now bust ya gun clack, clack

[Cappadonna]
Somethin in the street went bang, bang
Makin it hard for you to do your thang, thang
Somethin in the street went bang, bang

[Ghostface Killah]
Somethin in the hood went click, click
The box cutter went click, click
Somethin in the hood went click, click
The box cutter went click, click

[U-God]
Somethin in the slum went rum pu-pum-pum
Somethin in the slum went rum pu-pum-pum
