Song:   Zero Tolerance
Typed by: Cno Evil

"Weak MC's, approach with slang that's dead
You might as run into the wall and bang ya head" - U-God sample 2X

[Chorus: King Just]
Zero tolerance, save the noise that you hollering
Suffocate your rap, cut your oxygen
Breathe off your last breath, until there's no air left
A gladiator fights to the death

[King Just]
When the crowd hang, you'll win your freedom
Might as well join us, cuz you surely can't beat 'em
Defeat 'em, never heard of that, in my vocabulary
Advisery, get buried quick in a hurry
Staten Island Ferry, boy, don't worry
The most beautifullest since Keith Murray
Hot like curry food, boo! Like Chucky
And I only push a Benz if the eyes is buggy
Of course bitches love me, son ain't ugly
Dick Dastardly and dick 'em down like Muttley
Monthly, I switch, like brand new kicks
KJ all day, rock new brand hits
Name brand whips, same old shit
Man funkier than muthafucking drinks when they goosh
I can push, and right into the office
Beating all us, King Just is back, give it up, what

[Chorus]

[King Just]
Who would of thought, the'd be a second coming
The first one was the running, the third really wasn't
The fourth had 'em buzzing, the fifth they was listening
The sixth had 'em swearing, pumping seven in the morning
Eight MC's up, now they calling
Nine, ten, eleven, albums done, and we still balling
The falling, Tower New York, we want revenge
Fuck you, Zoo Crew, we ain't got too many friends
Here's a message that I send, my tolerance is zero
Windup like a sandwich, nigga, one dead hero
We don't sell no euros, we got official flow
That sometimes make the beats sound slow
Yo, speed it all up, I've been banging in the cut
But what, you thought I'd lay back and kick my feet up?
You gotta kick the dust off my thoughts I put in work
I took time off, while other rappers got jerked

[Chorus]

[King Just]
Black brawl, they thought they had my back against the wall
They like dominos, push one, they all gon' fall
Engine gon' stall, Peter paid Paul
And Pac rock all by the fucking liquor store
Snipers on call, summer bash brawl
Nasty nigga, fuck in bathroom stalls
You ain't got the balls, to fuck with the arsenal
You out your fucking mind? Boy I think logical
Trees tropical, while yours is no frills
Take you down in the town, you can't hide in the hill
We the rappers with no deals, why is that
We make shit happen, on four black wheels
Trust me, will, tell the truth
You can't hide, cuz we symbolize the root
You get the boot, I mean eviction notice
You coming for all mines, you owe us, you owe us

[Chorus]
