[Fingazz] I think they ready to bounce
          I think they ready to bounce
          I think they ready to bounce
          Then it's time
          To break it
          Down, down, down, down
          Down, down, down
[Psalmz]  {*laughing*}
          Come on!

Hook: Fingazz
You lookin' for that new shit
This is the new shit
That make your lil' mama wanna shake it
You lookin' for that new shit
This is the new shit
That used to make you bounce
You lookin' for that new shit
This is the new shit
That make your lil' mama wanna shake it
You lookin' for that new shit
This is the new shit
That used to make you bounce
Bounce

[Verse 1: Psalmz]
All they see is the glitter and fame
They never see all the news, you gotta pay to get in
Damn right, we had to make our way in
Cause nobody showed the shit on how to make it with them
So
We left it alone, and went on our own
Then came back a year later, and our record had blown
(???) all of the people would never have known
About us, wanna say they helped us get to the gold
But
We never mind 'em, keep on grindin'
And gonna be the first Latin emcees goin' diamond
And all the ones that used to doubt us, now we can't find 'em
If you see 'em, tell 'em we are shinin' (Shinin'...)

Chorus: T-Weaponz
Out with the old shit, in with the new shit
Y'all niggas can't do shit about it (Afuera)
So stop with the bullshit, cause if you gon' do shit
Then nigga, just do shit about it (Afuera)
Out with the old shit, in with the new shit
Y'all niggas can't do shit about it (Afuera)
So stop with the bullshit, cause if you gon' do shit
Then nigga, just do shit about it

[Verse 2: IzReal]
Who would have ever threw two and two, glued together
And knew'd we shoot through the roof, ruse and leathers
To show you, who is who, and who crew was better
Cause through and through the crew, no few could measure
Up with whatever, we are touchin', we're crushin' to them
So whoever we're touchin', get crutches for them
You're not so
Hot, so drop, roll
Move like you're walkin' on hot coal (Diablo)
Now the globe can witness, you bro is a-gifted
The flow is liquid (Liquid...)
Who would have known these misfits, would own the business
Like they hold the biscuit (Afuera)

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3: Ark]
Ain't it so funny, rep for nobody's a nobody
Knows what clothes, but me knows money with no money
Know no honey, I'm no dummy, I know
Cause we sold gold the whole globe, love me
Stop the press
News flash, my crew done flew past
If you snooze, you lose, we're moving too fast
So
Stash the cash in safes, before I pack
A basketcase, safe's done, crash the place
So when we said, then we meant it, then regret it
See, ya better be ready, T-Weaponz are three-headed
Monsters, so don't be gun ho
Cause when the guns blow
We unload them shots like drum rolls

Repeat Chorus Twice
