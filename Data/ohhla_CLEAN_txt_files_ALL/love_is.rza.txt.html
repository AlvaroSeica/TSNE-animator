Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Thea]
Your love so Digi, ahh
You make me dizzy, ahh
Your love so Digi, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

[RZA]
Yo, heart pounding, chart bounded
God astounded, well rounded
Lost and founded, stay surrounded
By these hoes, who can't count it
Park the whip, then dismount it
Forty ounce, yeah, I down 'em
Shorties drowns in pools of love
With these ounces, I be lounging
Roof thugs, chew on slugs
Maneuver through, hoods and clubs
Purple kush, by the bush
Dick is curved like Nike swoosh
Push, push, in this bush
Guaranteed to make her shush
Red bone, head on tilt
Six hundred cell phone bill
Big trucks, shell toe wheels
Velcro's loose, hell hold feels
Sell no pills, sell no deals
Niggas' styles, just no frills
You best to chill, nigga
Nigga, yea, you best to chill

[Beretta 9]
Yo, women I love 'em, leave 'em
Lust 'em, but I don't trust 'em
The reason most men be bugging
My lovin' Digi, you heard me?
Might finger fuck 'em
They sell me off in return
Women I love 'em, they love me back in return
I'm just a young man, head smart, cock strong
Got my swag' on, throw a mean dart, fuck it, we on
And got this fly talk, I kick that ass to the curb
You on the sidewalk, you gon' respect the dons words

[Chorus]

[Crisis]
Hypnotized by her hips and thighs
Beasting on the bitch, I ain't gon' lie
The H-E-Double N-E, Double S-Y
Got me in the vibe, her ass is super sized
I can see the future up in her eyes
We'll be dumb high, keep her occupied
Til the son rise, I beat it up right
Then she can't deny, she heard the roosters cry
Break her ass down with some crucial lines
Nasty darts known to seduce the mind
She all up in my world, she ain't even my girl
But she knowing my world produce dollar signs
Whispered in my ear, she'll swallow mine
Like she don't do this freaky type of shit all the time
Like she was the one, or her head was that bum
I be dumb, sprung and just call her mine

[Chorus]</pre>
