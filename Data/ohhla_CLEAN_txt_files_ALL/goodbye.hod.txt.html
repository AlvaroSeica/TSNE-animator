Song:   Goodbye
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Hodgy Beats]
My mind's a troubled friend
Can't come to signify
I'm blind my troubled friend
But feel the Samurai
When will the summer end?
He don't solidify
When I am gonna end
There's no return goodbye

[Hodgy Beats]
I'll disappear on you, disappear
See you in a couple years on you, years on you
Don't need your shoulder, shed no tears on you
I'm changing nut, switching gears on you

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
This is rock bottom and I've dropped off tons
You can bet your bottom dollar that I pocket ones
They got 99 problems, I got a lot of rum
And I drive a fast car, drop the top for fun

[Lee Spielman]
No longer in existence
Existence of your presence
And if the presents gifted
From this you'll learn your lesson [x2]

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Uh, I will skate from you, skate from you
Departure star, fade away from you, fade away
Drop out the side and fly vacate from you
You're negative I'm vibing hate from you
Used to be my main squeeze now you're my main pain
My grains and brain strains, I'll explain on my plane T
Frankly, I just wanted to be happy with you after all, huh
But after all the shit you put me through I'm OFF THE WALL

[Lee Spielman]
No longer in existence
Existence of your presence
And if the presents gifted
From this you'll learn your lesson [x2]

[Hodgy Beats]
My mind's a troubled friend
Can't come to signify
I'm blind my troubled friend
But feel the samurai
When will the summer end?
He don't solidify
When I am gonna end
There's no return goodbye</pre>
