[Intro]
Yeah
Young noble outlaw!
Is like my days is my nights
The pain come to life
My wrong is my right
They came with a price!

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Life is sort of like dice you gotta shake em up
Wake em up, let em fly, wish em luck
Coin toss you never know how they gon land you can wind up
The underdog or hand an upper hand
Control your destiny you gotta have a plan on ya
Destiny or fail,heacen or hell
I put my soul on it
I'm fightin devil niggas daily
Talkin to the angels Kadafi I know you hear me!
Talkin to god tryna show him that I know him everybody
kissin ass to go to heaven ain't goin
The game ain't loyal
And dont expect nothing from nobody thay ain gon to nothin for you
Cut them the fast money
Make a nigga spoil you
Trickin at the stripclub and can't afford a loyal
Shit, these niggas got the game twisted
I'm glad when they was spittin at game I paid attention

[Chorus](x2)
Is like my days is my nights
And everything I write
Visualize so vividly the pain come to life!
These young niggas was caught to do wrong and so right
Appetite for destruction they came with a price!

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my people stealin shackles is an everyday battle
Everything black tryna murder their own shuttle
My people bein hurt when ban poozoo im a true king a warrior zulu
My people in the matrix so gone is frightening
And you mean muggin your brother but smillin at the white man
My people need freedom
Searching for black jesus
Too many rappers
Not enough leaders
Whole lotta trappers
Very few fathers
Premature funerals over a few dollars
My people laws
Dont nobody come and say anybody want swag dont nobody want substance
We god souljas we search the true
Make the earth move
We gorgoutating the truth
My people need help I ain't give a fuck how you feelin
If you ain't felling me who the fuck is you feeling?

[Chorus](x2)
Is like my days is my nights
And everything I write
Visualize so vividly the pain come to life!
These young niggas was caught to do wrong and so right
Appetite for destruction they came with a price!</pre>
