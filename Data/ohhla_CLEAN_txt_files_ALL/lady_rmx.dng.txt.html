Hook:
You're my lady (x4)

Don't think I don't see them looking at you
All of them wishing they could have you
And as a matter of fact, uh
A bunch of them are itchin' for you to scratch 'em
I'm tiried of hiding what we feel
I'm trying to come with the real
And I'm gonna make it known
Cause I want them to know

Hook

You're my little baby (baby) my darling baby (baby)
I swear you're the talk of the town
and everybody wants to know what's going down
Babe, I know they've seen us before
Maybe at the liquor store, or maybe at the health food stand
They don't know that I'm your man

Hook

I can tell they're looking at us
I pick you up everyday from your job
And everyguy in the parking lot wants to rob me of my girl
And my heart and soul, and everybody wants to treat me so cold
But I know I love you and you love me
There's no other lover for you or me

AZ:
Yeah, yo though I only paid you occasional
I'm raising you up then those ivading you
Pushing up persuading you with conversation 
That consist of solicitation false information
See I deal with sophistication, shimp and lobster style 
You see me dressed up proper in crocodile
Crock awhile I leave alone, unofficial is not your style
My innger vision is this plush life living, me escaping the inner city
prision
Raping our women is causing havoc
Breaking bonds that birth marriage this Earth was once lavish
Now it's ursed left for a savage
Mind, I tech mine, respect mine, let's connect projects 
Lex wet sex and wine all the time, the Firm staff on the climb
Nas the trio, D'Angelo and Primo
You know how we go
Firm affiliation  9-6
