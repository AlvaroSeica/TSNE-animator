How do you feel mighty Megatron? Yah!
Astro Train, transform and get us out of here
They must be terminated
Autobots, die!
Wait, I still function
Okay, Optimus, what's the plan?

[Cno Evil]
Welcome to prime time, the optimus rhyme lines
Smokescreen making ya eyes blind, I fight crimes
Grapple amongst mines, hang on for dear life
I hear a little bit of jazz in the back, it feels nice
I'm a suicidal cliffjumper, warpath bumper
Bad muthafuckin' ratchet totin', power gliding huffer
Spliff puffer, blowing your house down, prowl with no mistakes
Tailgate with outback steaks
Rap on tracks, wheeljack stashed in the back trunk
Rap with a pimp cup, hanging amongst trumps
I hide my iron like a mirage, you can't see the Gods
Tiny like a bumblebee, with a buzz of an entourage
Inferno, internal affair, of my journal topics
Blur, hurting your optics, with all type of objects
Like gears, hubcaps, pipes, knifes, guns and swords
Five forty and sideswipe, knock you off your boards
Swerve off road marks resemble those that skid
Hound dogs and clown cats can't sniff the kid
Red alert, Red Zone biz breaking your trail
And the sunstreak is unique, I blew past the tail again
Hoisted above grounds, elevate to top floors
With so much brawn, I charge the wind when I get bored
Take it like a Hot Rod, yeah, you know kid, J.C.
The R-O like a B-O-T, automatically

[Li-Mouse]
Aiyo, inject my cassette, I produce sound waves
Still trying to figure out how Mouse found ways
To ravage and ramsack, your chop shop
You wanna rumble with us, aiyo, this is not pop
The shots leave suprised, sound like thunder crackers
The shockwaves that inflict some other factors
Blast from far, you don't know how far seems
Just know I got shit that'll make a sun scream
S.O.S., yes, who be the best?
I drop bomb shells, spray shrapnel rip through your vest
Fuck a hook, I'm in it for a long haul
The porsche won't break down, no chance to stall
Me, the high octain, wild rider on the drastic
You a dead and cock rider, you fag bitch
I'm coming in big like a wrestler, peep the mega tron
Arm slaughter verses, yeah, you know who got the better song
Blast off doors, now you stuck in tantrums
Mouse with vocal Cno, the mixmaster anthem
I kick back in my chair, this shit is so easy
The way the skyboard, made it a bit breezy
You MC's wanna give me the fucking runabout
Call up the slug slinger to shut they mouth
No time for misfires, your tread is shot
This is all a fact, man, this ain't a bunch of crock
Slicing down on your like we some warrior axes
Then drop chops, no choice but to call me master
Keep running they mouth, I call 'em motor head
But I just can't stop, that's what the Rodent said
We more than what meets any of your eyes
Don't be deceived by the many of the lies
