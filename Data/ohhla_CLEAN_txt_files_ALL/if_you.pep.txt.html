(Pep Love)
I'm a nigga on the brink
What, you think I can't touch you?
Reach through the speaker
And crunch you in the eardrum
Come here
Some of the fearsome
Thoughts that I brought to pierce em
Assumption's doom, ya malfunction
Soon as the sound's pumpin
I'm settin it, lettin em know
I'm about somethin
At least seven figures and then some
To get some, you gotta spend somethin
Increasing my income
Outcome's tremendous
How come these hoes be
Off the hinges
When they peepin my potentials
Platinum plus, stackin them bucks
Til they touch the clouds
(??? punks) contemplating comin after us
Now, soon as I touch down
My fervor to get further is murderous
Plus I must bust
Outta these constraints
And ease the pain
Baby get up off your knees
So I can seize and gain
I got G's to make, not a mistake
You try to bust?
I'll throw you in a bottomless lake
With bricks tied to ya feet
I'm not letting shit slide
While I'm taking you bitches
On this long dick ride

Chorus (2x):

Uhh yeah
You can't compare
Can't nobody fuck with us
Nohow and nowhere
And it don't stop (repeated)
And it won't stop (repeated)

(Casual)

Hey, my style be
Deep sea algae
How he seeing me?
I'm PG&amp;E, me and P
Regulating and monitoring
Your currency
Good samaritan
Flipped totalitarian
Maxed out McLarean [sic]
With (Cherry ???)
Varyin from angry to merry men
The suspicious pall bearer
At your burying and I'm carryin
Like AI, never been on the bay
With the pelicans
Cause I practiced the art to
Outsmart they art-ificial intelligence
Man of melanin
Is in my spirit
From my skin to my skeleton
B-boy stance while ya knees went gelatin
Cause I'm bailin in
With Pep Love and Del again
Heaven sent crooked angels
Glarin from crooked angles

(Chorus 2x)

Believe you me
I'll fuck around and get medieval
When I lay down the laws
And cause an upheaval
On you and your people, yeah
That's how we doing ya
Keep on pursuing the revenue
And the heaven that's right here
Lyrics I spit move at twenty light
Years per second wreckin this hype shit
Smooth and excellent
Lewd and lascivious
Dude from the Heiroglyphics Imperium
Museum of my music
Not abstract or thug, alternative or pop
This is hip-hop, the shit I live,
Love, and utilize to capitalize
Make it happen to brutalize
You weak niggaz that keep rappin
And I'm a human being
Doing my thing to pursue my dreams
Being a super supreme
Triple scooping the green
No need to categorize or gossip
All that really matters is
None of you guys can top it

Chorus (3x)</pre>
