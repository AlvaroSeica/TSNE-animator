[Intro]
All I wanted to do was rhyme nigga
You know say mic check 1-2-1-2-1-2
Turn my mic up, check one two
and the rest of that old punk shit
Motherfuckers just ain't care
Like I ain't, like I ain't really 'bout this shit
C'mon.. I'ma start off crime for these motherfuckers

[Chorus 2X: Lil' Fame]
Yo I'm a Brownsvillain, chillin and I don't give a fuck
about a killin cause I'm still in effect when you're illin
(C'MON! HO, HO, HO)

[Lil' Fame over Chorus]
Check check, yo yo...
Uhh, uhh, get it...

[Lil' Fame]
It's some big boy game bitch and I'm diesel, 8 years lethal
It's Lil' Fame a/k/a Clarence the 5th Beatle
I'm kosher, my paradigm is Hebrew
It's +Common Sense+ dawg, I do it for +The People+
They don't wanna rap in the session, with slap in the session
That's like standin by Yasser Arafat in the session
And the outcome is critical, no jokin
Smoked with 4-5's but the sign said no smokin

[Billy Danze]
Okay I see 'em (line it up, line it up) assemble your crew
If he sharp (sign him up, sign him up) back to do what we do
So for you (time is up, time is up) we, the legendary M.O.P.
(The powers that, BE) keep it crunk (and WE)
could give a fuck (I SEE) your mouth bigger than your gun
and your heart (it ain't your role) you ain't playin your part
Lil' nigga be smart, or get a hole pushed through
the back of your tatters for thinkin that I'm average or soft

[Chorus] + ad libs

[Lil' Fame]
Aiyyo your time is up (cause this Mo' Peez) wisen up
(M.O.P.!) We size 'em up, my niggaz is live as fuck
We give 'em the whole thing, do you rotten (?)
Bitch, we don't wanna party wit'chall
Pardon me pah, sometimes I act retardedly pah
Pop one in your wig, two more in your body and heart
On GP (nigga) cause we don't walk it out and talk it out
We stalk 'em out and chalk 'em out (Billy Danze, whattup?)

[Billy Danze]
That's my nigga he understands real, that's Fizzy wo'
Homey nigga that understand Bill, I keep it low
so you never know how the man feel (the GANGSTA)
Got a different kind of appeal, you niggaz ain't really real
I don't cruise past you dudes, I hover over you fools
Makin you nauseous, I'm big with it bitch I'm flawless
The 'Ville shit is cordless, when out of town I'm down with it
You clown niggaz need to be cautious

[Chorus] + ad libs</pre>
