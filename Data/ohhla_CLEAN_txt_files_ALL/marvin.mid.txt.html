I'm stuck
Behind welfare
And failed healthcare
And hell yeah hells here
We in deaths lair
It's a blessing to live
But birth is the curse
Whats worse
Our faiths been hurt
And merked for the church
I'm trapped between the gates of fate
Friend
Governments like
Fuck what they wanna do
Its what we make them
So we naturally assume
Its they fault and we hate them
Til truths are uncovered for my brothers that it aint them
Higher powers got me living bummy off dice
That's right
Cause my life
I treat money like Christ
Its wrong
To my capturers I'm a barcode
Whose lost soul was sold for gold on crossroads
They pack us like rats in the ghetto
Play us from above like japetto while attracting the devil
Liquor stores surround ours
Like prison walls
Being drunk is prohibited
Don't play your music loud
Now being crunks limited
Ways of the world
We the bottom dwellers that was raised by the squirrels
Have mercy
Its partly our fault
Bad earth seeds
And curtis don't help ask percy
We climb from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom
Right beans
There's fat ass cream in rice and beans
At 14 girls is likely to look like 19
Younger and younger they have pipe dreams
I lost the love
The zest to be fresh
Cause love is now hate
All respect is in death
I ask
When did life stop giving a shit
And since when being ignant was slick
Its not fam
About bread
Its hard to get it legit
So now we concentrate to get it to flip
Like got damn
I feel life loves niggaz that's rich
And the rest of us can stumble and sit
In hot sand</pre>
