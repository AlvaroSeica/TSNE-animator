I know this young nigga who love to keep his gun in his pants
14, little Ant will snatch your shit to enhance
He lost his moms at a early age, pops was cracked out
His brother ran a drug house where they slept with they Mac's out
And where we from, fuck them basketball teams
And your neighborhood PAL cause it's all about makin cream
He stayed dirty, copped a clip for thirty
He'd rather be sellin drugs early instead of young, black and nerdy
He had his hard hat, born ready for war
This young nigga heart's gone and I saw this before
He lived day by day, prey by prey, stray by stray
Blunted on Chancellor Ave. 380 hallway
He bought a AK and I know he gon' sway, it ain't no damn way
That this young nigga can turn his life around, mang
Now where is God when you need him, he's internally bleedin
Little Ant's barely breathin but he gotta stay eatin
So he robs again but this time he all smoked out
He put his finger on the trigger and let the death fly out
Some man got hit, he's layin on the pavement stiff
Blood drippin from his face and he drownin in it
Now what a surprise that little Ant can't come around
That it's his own man dead on the ground
Dead on the ground

Damn
He can't come around
That it's his own man dead on the ground
Dead on the ground

Lost, turned out
Not a doubt
What's it all about
Lost, turned out
Not a doubt
What's it all about

Baby girl, I can see you in that crazy world
Spinnin out of control, nowhere to go
At one point in time, huh, you could've been mine
But you was movin too fast, couldn't take the chance in losin yo ass
In high school, we was homies, but that was before we
Started keepin each other from bein lonely
With my mama workin all the time and your daddy drinkin
Sneakin, tryin to bump and grind, what is he thinkin?
We escaped in each other, became friends before lovers
More like sister and brother, at least we can trust us
But I had dreams, yeah, my plane leavin soon
Had to hook up with Pac, huh, continue to bloom
I called twice just to see if you alright
Both times you wasn't home, I knew somethin was wrong
And then I knew I was right, when they said they found you one night
Barely holdin on, tell me where did you go wrong?
Was it when you started strippin for tips?
Then sellin it for mo' chips?
And sniffin powder just to deal with it
Can you tell me, I guess that you can't
Cause I'm hearin you about to take your last dance
Let the game get the best of you, baby
Shoulda called on a Law, he was testin you, baby
But now you gone before you can be found
Gone without a doubt, lost and turned out
Lost and turned out

Lost, turned out
Not a doubt
What's it all about
Lost, turned out
Not a doubt
What's it all about

My brother Sean, he home now, he cool for a minute
I love him to death but bullshit he stays in it
I'm gettin older [Name] middle school around the corner
The drug dealers need and teach what they wanna
"Moms, can I go to the park and play?"
Didn't play, I was countin every single cent them niggas made
Then his moms lost her job, no more money-stackin
On her way home she slipped on some ice and caught a back spasm
And that's what happened to Aline
She said she had lotta pains, just an excuse to be a fiend
Low on food, though it was good what my mama made
But you know a hungry nigga at school can't concentrate
B to an F student
Think about the bitches and the sneakers, my whole childhood ruined
I made my first sale ( ? ) in a alley way in 164
I was scared as shit
I wasn't scared of the cops though, this is true
I was more scared of what mom duke'd do
So I chilled for a few instead of ( ? )
Spent weekends with my peeps just escapin the block
Little [Names], I knew em since seven
We had a room, they had a house, just no way to compare it
But they parents taught me shit and gave me shit
Fed me, treated a nigga just like family
You gave me love and you neglected me too
Lost and turned out but still comin home to you
I love you [Name]
I love you [Name]

Lost and turned out but still comin home to you
I love you [Name]

Lost, turned out
Not a doubt
What's it all about
Lost, turned out
Not a doubt
What's it all about</pre>
