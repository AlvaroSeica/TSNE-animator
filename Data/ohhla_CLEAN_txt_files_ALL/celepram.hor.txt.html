[Solo]
One of these days I'm gonna shut my eyes forever
So tired of seeing what's wrong with life
And as much as I wish that I got along better
with these people

I've heard it written that every flower withers
So I carve up my palm just to bleed these inscriptions
Sometimes it's a given, sometimes it's not
and we struggle with the pieces to the puzzle of the plot
And all I see on my CD shelves
are the pieces of me that probably need help
Like I don't eat good, so I've always got the hunger pains
Rocking baggy clothes to hide the fact that I'm underweight
I bust a phrase to escape cause I'm feeling stuck for days
Nothing changes but the motherfucking date
It's such a shame, see the structure crumble and fade
until you're left with nothing but some dust on the clay
Life gets ugly, writing rhymes to Jeff Buckley
A cold and broken "Hallelujah" for this crash test dummy
I've been accepting the past, I've been the first to cry
Now I'm hoping I'll be the last to laugh
In this paradoxical existence
where the oxygen we breathe to live corrodes our bodies and kills us
If I could hold my breath for eternity
then I'd live forever but never deliver these words I speak
I can't do this anymore mum
Sick of the baggage under my eyes, the vanity of my forearms
I hate my body, it's just a shell for my soul
And my songs will live on long after my bell has been tolled
And would you even cry?
Could you move on with your life or would you need to know the reason why?
I'm feeling grand and poetic
Might the Kurt Cobain route and blow my fucking brains out, there, I said it
Sometimes I need to talk to someone, I'm just not sure who
That feeling of the morning after, the lockjaw blues
And I can't write about the breakup, been numb for too long
Every day is like a breakdown, I can't seem to move on
So what I crack a few smiles? It's all futile
The Grey Space, Hip Hop, Beyondblue star
Waiting for the beat to stop in this game of musical chairs
I'm just a kid trying to make something beautiful, there

{Repeat 2X}
One of these days I'm gonna shut my eyes forever
So tired of seeing what's wrong with life
And as much as I wish that I got along better
with these people, don't you think that there's a reason why?</pre>
