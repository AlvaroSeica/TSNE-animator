[Intro]
GEAH! This the So Icy remix
Featuring Lil' Kim (LUDA~!)
Yeah I got my Crown Royal, the Coogi on right now man
Sit in my cell fiend, I'm good I'm comfortable
You feel me?

[Chorus]
Now she's a very freaky gurl (yeah) don't bring her to mama (yeah)
First you get her name (yeah) then you get the number (yeah)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer {*2X*}
She's a very freaky gurl; she get it from her mama (yeah)
First you get her name (name) then you get her number (number)
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer {*2X*}

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci King, ding-a-ling, bet I make your back hurt
Bet I make your cat squirt, bet I make your neck jerk
Called Lil' Kim, told her better wear a tight skirt
Bet I know your type work, bet I make you cum first
Gucci Mane (yeahhhhhhh) bet we make a sex tape
Put it on the internet, put it on my MySpace (well damn!)
Gucci got a big stick, that can sing my ad libs
Yeahhhhhhhhh, but you gotta be a Queen Bitch
So icy trap star, fucked her like a porn star
Brought my ace too, then I fucked her in her own car
Face down, ass up, I'ma make her love me
Probably don't love me but love to suck and fuck me
Gucci wanna sex ya, tell me is you interested?
Climb it good or hit it dog, I ain't even in it yet
For the twenty minutes dog, I ain't even nutted yet
Now she's braggin on me dog, I ain't even started yet

[Chorus] - first half

[Lil' Kim]
I'm a very freaky girl, very freaky girl-girl
Very freaky girl, very freaky girl-girl {*2X*}
Ohhhh! You want a freaky girl? Welcome to Kim's world
You ain't gon' wanna leave just like a kid at Disney World
My deep throat have you spurtin like a water gun
Coochie overflowin like somebody let the faucet run
Bust one nut, I ain't done, I got mo' to cum
Friends tell 'em all to come, we gon' have some orgy fun
YEAHHHHH, chew on me like some bubble gum
I lick you like a lollipop, won'tcha taste my honey bun?
It's our little secret, just like my underwear
You know pain is pleasure, can you make me shed a tear?
Smack my ass, grab my neck, got him cummin everywear
I'm a freak so I don't care, just don't get nuttin in my hair
Now he callin me wifey, and he want to introduce me
Takin me on shoppin sprees, he wanna buy me Gucci (Gucci)
Do me like Bootsy on the back of his Suzuki
And I ain't even sex him, all I did was let him eat my...
COOCHIE!

[Gucci Mane] + (Lil Kim)
Hahaha, okay! (OHHH!)
It's Gucci (Lil' Kim)

[Chorus] - second half

[Ludacris]
LUDA~! I got some brain up in the front seat of the Hummer
And if you can make it rain, then Ludacris can make it thunder
I ain't messin with these lames, but I seem to make 'em wonder
How I came and took the game for the past seven summers
How your woman wanna get it from the front, from the back
If she with it I'ma hit it from the side
Give her what she want, in the 'llac
She a freak and I can see it in her eyes
She can go tit, for tat, it's so good that I make her wanna cry
A little bit of this, a little of that for a two piece biscuit and some fries
straight from Church's, your boyfriend's worthless
Cause Luda goes DEEP while he barely scratch the surface
She itchin fo' a scratch like she DJ J.C.
If you lookin for your match BEITCH come and find me
I'll be in the A-Town, I ain't that hard to find
Put your legs up in the air and see the D.T.P. sign
If you wanna meet my momma that's a thang I won't do
You say motherfuck me, naw motherfuck YOU, know why?

[Chorus] - first half

[Lil' Kim]
I'm a very freaky girl, very freaky girl-girl
Very freaky girl, very freaky girl-girl {*3X*}
OHHHHH!</pre>
