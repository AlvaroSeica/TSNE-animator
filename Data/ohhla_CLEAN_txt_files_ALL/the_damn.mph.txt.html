The truth ain't nothin to brag about
The truth ain't nothin to brag about
The truth ain't nothin to brag about
The truth ain't nothin to brag about

[Hook]
"Damn truth", barstool confessions at The Grandview
"Damn truth", brought along a strong humble attitude
Here is the "damn truth", gotta give the "damn truth"
Brand new lease on life, I've gotta thank you

[Verse 1]
Aiyyo first off, had to get my head to workshop
Spanner in those works and the nerves were turned off
Smirnoff seduced me, tryna find myself
Thinkin I might just lose me, lunacy spreading through
The presence of my efforts, when it hits the fan
Shit flicks, bounces off self-inflicted Dan
But never quit, quick to build a bridge, rivers and dams
Watch the mirror split, thinking I could miss my chance
Looked back at the cracked glass, never saw a rap star
Pay for my mistakes but I'ma take the cab charge
My backyard is filled with growth
Plus a whole lot of green, now let's kill it slow

[Hook] {X2}

[Verse 2]
And we won't stop yet, cause we ain't got where
We're headed, you get it? You fuckin sceptic
A simple concept to kill the wrong bet
Then resurrect the truth that festers
Your mouldy cheese got a stench and swollen feet
From walking a fine line of lies, your talk is cheap
So media reports are free but more importantly
Does it support your beliefs? Come on
I'm just an ordinary man tryna scan behind the news
Iris finds the contact slightly askew
We're fighting the flu while they're fighting to move
Come on, show me a sign and provide me the proof
Now not what's televised live to our youth
And you should be obliged to supply the whole view
Cancelling the smoke and mirrors
I got a big nose to poke in the business of your chosen images, what?

[Hook]

[Repeat X2]
The truth ain't nothin to brag about
The truth ain't nothin to brag about
The truth ain't nothin to brag about
The truth ain't nothin to brag about</pre>
