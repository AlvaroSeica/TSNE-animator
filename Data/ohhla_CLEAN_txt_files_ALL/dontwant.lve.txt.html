Song:   I Don't Want Her
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I see him looking at my woman
They ain't looking, I don't want that girl
They ain't looking, I don't want her
If they ain't looking, I don't want that girl, no

20 Gs in Ball Harbor, 50 racks in Rodeo
That 70, 000 on garments
Nigga, you gonna have to get another jail
Rollie and the day out and she want a new one
Your pocket is about to KO, what the fuck you doing?
You can't afford my savage, who the fuck is screwing?
Of course I have a fly bitch, look at how she fluent
And shorty got them things on her
Tatted up, shorty got my name on her
Give 100 K, now my shorty got some change on her
Said you goddamn right I'm stating claim on her, that's my bitch
You niggas can't stand it but looking at her won't do me damage
Plus she like girls, too, it's a video shoot in the bedroom, setting up cameras
So you really think a DM can harm me? Won't we just spend the weekend in Barney's?
The reason that your BM is on me is she don't wanna work no more like Tami
So go ahead and look hard, that's a bad motherfucker, good God
While you was busy plotting on mine she done fucked around and took yours
El Presidente unimpeachable, my phone's on "fuck you, I'm unreachable"
I ain't gotta touch you, I tell your people to
I send one of my bitches to go be with you
That's a cold play, I tell her fix you
a Molotov cocktail against your picture
Light up your life, this ain't Scripture
she good at being in bed, that's one hell of a mixture
So you looking at my woman, if you don't I don't want her
And she run around with niggas in black suits
in them black on black coupes saying one is Obama, man

I see him looking at my woman
They ain't looking, I don't want that girl
They ain't looking, I don't want her
If they ain't looking, I don't want that girl, no</pre>
