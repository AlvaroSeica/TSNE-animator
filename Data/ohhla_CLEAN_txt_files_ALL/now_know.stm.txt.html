[Chorus]
Keep doing what your doing praise God all day
no matter what people may say
where my dogs at roof
where my ladies at owwww
and if you didn't know the messenger you know now

[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning pull the sheets from my head
Wipe the sleep from eyes get up off the bed
Still kind of sleepy so I walk round half dead
Step in the studio cause I got tracks in my head
Say a prayer to the father he's my number one choice
Got e-mail from my homies KaBuc and The VOICE
Write rhymes all day sit back and reminisce
Give thanks to the father for the good life I lived
I'm not rich in cash but I'm the richest in the world
Got a family who loves me a beautiful wife my girl
The lord up above has been good to me
Wakes me up every morning gives me air to breathe
I know someday I'm gonna reap what I've sacrificed
Make enough to buy a house for my moms and wife
But until that day I'll keep doing what I'm doing
living my life for God steadily pursuing

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You've been there thru the good you've been there thru the bad
You've seen me real happy and you've seen me real sad
You're the one who truly knows the rough side of Smooth
And that is why I came to prove
And give props to the one whom props is due
The reason why I'm here is because of you
And I ain't gonna quit till my missions thru
I'm just getting started mike check one two
so get used to the sound of the voice you hear why
when you hear you will now that the lord is nearby
The lord up above has been good to me
Wakes me up every morning gives me air to breathe
I know someday I'm gonna reap what I've sacrificed
Make enough to buy a house for my moms and wife
But until that day I'll keep doing what I'm doing
living my life for God constanly pursuing

[Chorus]</pre>
