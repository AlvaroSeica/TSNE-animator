I'm just looking for consolidaty
Isolated from the cemetery
Cuz everyday another tragedy
Most of homies they ain't make it past 23
What's scary is I'm still uncertain
Is it a Heaven when they pull my curtain?
Scared of reflections like a groundhog
Truthfully it seems I always tend to doubt God
Out of place like I'm dislocated
And I'm feeling unappreciated
Finding comfort in this rock and a hard place
At this point call me Judas I betray grace
Bad decision good intention
Bad decision good intention
I'm just looking for an angel
And I'm praying for a savior
They frontin' on me like I'm rosa Parks
But still I'm focused concentrating like I'm throwing darts
Cold blooded got this ice inside my veins
And that's reality for me just so I can find a way to numb pain
Forest Gumpn' from the tribulations
I making friends with satan
I need some medication
Cause death is looking beautiful
They say success is represented at your funeral
Running circles like a rat wheel
Felling invincible I hide behind Achilles heel
Seeking distorted love I'm looking for divorce
Infiltrated by the poison like a gift inside the Trojan horse
I'm Infested by these cockroaches
Leeches
They try and use you cuz they know you chosen
Golden
Ground the path I choose to walk on
Still I'm steady climbing to my pinnacle like King Kong
So insane I stare at padded walls
Climbing mountains but I always seem to slip and fall
Started from the bottom and that's real ain't no metaphor
But you won't see inside my heart core
I'd give all just see the love
Though I know it's mine it's fitting like its OJ's glove
Controlled by imperfection
Seeking for acceptance
Off balance like I'm ice skating
Persuaded by anything that glorifies a lack patience
Living for approval
Dying from rejection
Temporary like the pain of a lethal injection I'm infected
I'm just looking for an angel
Praying for a Savior</pre>
