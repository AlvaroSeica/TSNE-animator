Sweatin' hard I'm a nigga-hit-it tactic,
If you gonna hit a cat,
Lick him off of that,
5 minutes nigga, put a PRICE on his putty tat,
I go to the car lot, test drive his shit,
So a nigga know off top, that I ain't about that bullshit,
I like a nigga with a big dick who could work it,
Don't try to play me like a fool bitch or you get dealt with,
Keep your eye on the prize, and watch me work it,
Don't let your dick get on hard, or I will jerk it,

And quit it girl,
