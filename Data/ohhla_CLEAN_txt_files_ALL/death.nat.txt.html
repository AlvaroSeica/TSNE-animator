"Dearly beloved"

Life After death which one do you choose?
From my pointa view ain't got shit to lose
And life ain't shit but a state a mind
I hear voices in my head that keep tellin me I'm dead
I sing the blues until my tongue gets black
I breathe my last breath on a funky track
Some say we all are evil, we all are the same
I roll with a gang and Natas is the name
I say my slang ain't no shame to my game
Life after death, I feel no pain
I pimp strut around and limbo
I got hellish rhymes on my mind so I might let 'em flow
I shot those suckas and I'll shoot the rest
I'm down with Natas and the life after death
To the beat, to the beat, to the funk and a freak
That I kick suck my dick suck my fuckin dick
Life after death, it really makes you wonder
Niggaz feel the blast from the shotgun thunder
Catch me if you can, understand if you can
Life after death, the tales of a mad man
It's a mystery, what's next? What's next?
Take a guess, is there life after death?

"If you know what time it is, it's time to get ill"
"He put the gun to my head and this is what he said"
"I think you know what timeit is, it's time to get ill"
"And I shot those suckas and I'll shoot the rest"

The preacher told me I shouldn't say
We're all gonna die on judgement day
The preacher told a lie that's why I don't pray
God bless the child to the rhythm that I play
Dead on arrival, no time for no survival
I'm lookin at the signs and they all are reading vital
I think I'm suicidal, because of my recital
Some say I'm psycho, they label it my title
Natas is down to do the do with whoever
My voodoo is clever, can you fuck with it? Never
Anybody in the path of the road that I travel
It's journey for a battle
Life after death, when you die then you're dead
Headed for the afterlife, hole in your head
The symptoms of insanity has got me on the ledge
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
Two to the head, they label me a dead
I'm better off dead, I'm already dead
You've never heard a dead man rock it deadly
I keep askin myself is the world ready
I get rough like a nap in a niggaz head
I chop off ya head, and then I fill ya fulla lead
This shit gets yo ass like a shot gun to the chest
So close your eyes and breathe your last breath
No other alternative, so tell me what's left
So you can find out first hand, is there life after death?

"Get ready cause this ain't funny"
"Get ready cause this ain't funny"
"Get ready cause this ain't funny"
"Get ready cause this ain't funny"

Natas and the crew, the year is 92
I thought you know you know, I thought you said you knew!
Life is like that, it's like this round the clock
Acid rap, spiced with a little bit a rock
And roll, rockin your soul from life to death
Back from hell to yell and tell my tale
So you can tell a preacher, that a niggaz out to teach ya
Not a creature feature, but I'm still I can reach ya
It's me, TNT, black devil head master
M-I-N-D, and we ain't friendly
I let you all see, what I can see
Life after death, and death's after me!
I was born to die, but I'm born again
I sport the wicked grin, cause I was born in sin
I'm not a bapist or a buddha or a monk
Just a funky nigga with the showel and funk
So if I spill my guts upside a bloody cross
My hands all bloody inside the bloody sauce
So tell me what's next, God knows my name
I feel no pain, so is there life after death?

"Natas, life after death"</pre>
