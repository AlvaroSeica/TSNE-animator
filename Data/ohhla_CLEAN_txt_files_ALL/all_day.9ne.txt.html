Song:   All Day All Night
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
This ain't nothin' like a 9 to 5
A superstar now is your life
Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!

All day all night [x4]

[Verse 1]
I wrote my life down from '85 to right now
And my style had a heap of people just like wow
Schizophrenic, grim, and venomous lyrics with a slight growl
I was destined to be Tech, to rip and excite crowds
So my pals think after I rip the mic down it's lights out and right to the pillow with my right eyebrow
But when I chow I stay up and write sounds
I like loud I stay 'wake and create late like a night owl
Meetin' deadlines serious is fed time
They said I'm extremely different and I headline
I wed rhymes married to this game and my breads fine
That's why I'm always rocking classic J's the red kind
With that said I'm always up in y'alls sight
Something is all wrong being spotted it's all right
Thinking that I'm the naw type is all hype
I ain't gotta problem with being Tech all day and all night
Forreal

[Chorus]
This ain't nothin' like a 9 to 5
A superstar now is your life
Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!

[Verse 2]
I write my flows and record 'em
I do my shows and we floored 'em
And so they go let's award with merch and ticket sales
That's why my clothes I afford 'em
That's love I know never short 'em
So why would I go and avoid 'em and curse and give it hell
They spot me at the movies sip and try to press a nooby
Gettin' through this is hectic, next to me singin my message to me
But I never get back to Scroogy
When I'm at the Ruby Tuesday
That's a doozy follow me for autographs when I'm set to dookie
Ewwwwwwwww
That's TMI, Whether I'm on the street or fly
What they need is I to be seated high and this heat is why
Even sometimes I be down and dark they all bright
Liftin' me up being Tech Nina all day and all night
Yeah

[Chorus]
This ain't nothin' like a 9 to 5
A superstar now is your life
Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!

[Verse 3]
Ey, they even find me up in Wal-Mart and give me coochy coupons sexy mama's be all heart
Even at the Mandalay Bay I'm off in the mall part
Chicks looking for me patrolling the area like Paul Blart
And it be the same when I'm with the chief, The Game
People greet me heat arranged
Sleep they need to meet the strange
Cat, cuz he became the creature sent to eat the game
Speaking of eat the pizza came and the beast unframed of the pizza main (man?)
At the funeral taking pictures no urinals
Not only when I'm on tour you know where I'm steppin' they sure to show
And it's a blessing even if I'm stressin' I'm durable
And You're to know, to do this like tech you have to endure the grow
Yo!

[Chorus]
This ain't nothin' like a 9 to 5
A superstar now is your life
Married to it like it's my wife
I gotta be Tech N9ne!</pre>
