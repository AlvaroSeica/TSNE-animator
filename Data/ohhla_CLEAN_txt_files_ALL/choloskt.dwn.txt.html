Song:   Cholo Skate
Typed by: no1wammy@hotmail.com

[Fingazz]
"Fin-fin-fin-fin-Fingazz on the track"

Hook: Down
You do it in the club
You do it in the 'Llac
All the girls love when you skate to the track
Do it like this
And like that
Hey DJ, run it back, let me skate to that

[Fingazz]
"I-I, I wanna get my skate on"
"Wanna get my cholo skate on"
"I, I wanna skate"
"I, I wanna skate"
"Skate, cho, cholo skate"

[Verse 1: Down]
Skate down the block on chrome D's
Lean Like A Cholo, that's me
I ain't the type to be dancin'
My six-three just to bouncin' {*screeching*}
I put it on three
So cold, I give you brain freeze
I see you watchin' me
Come here, little mama, and hold these
Naw
You know I'm jokin'
Put you on the team, I'm good at coachin'
I, am
Always scopin'
An itty gritty over there always loc'in'

Refrain: Down
Bounce
Flow
Cholo skatin'
Like my shoes were made by Daytons
Just glide
And hit side to side
And if you ain't with it, then you probably hatin'

Chorus: Fingazz
"I wanna get my skate on"
"Wanna get my cholo skate on"
"I, I wanna get my skate on"
"I wanna get my skate on"
"Wanna get my cholo skate on"
"I-I, I wanna get my skate on"
"Wanna get my cholo skate on"
"I, I wanna skate"
"I, I wanna skate"
"Skate, cho, cholo skate"

(Verse 2)
(Down in background) {Down *slowed down*}
[Down]    You ain't never heard no shit like this
          Kilo got that new sound
          Old school with a gangsta twist
          I'm brown and I put it down
          Hey girl, take off the cuffs
          How you gon' put your elbows up
[Fingazz] "Elbows up"
          "Side to side"
          "El-elbows up-up, side to side" (Like a cholo)
[Down]    Like I said
          I like you
          I like you, only now, I want 'em all
          It's all good
          Still in the hood
          Only now, I can buy the whole damn mall
          Now look at her skate down real low
          Girl, show me how low you go
          Slow down for the dip like low pros
          Lollipoppin' that thing in {slow mo}

Repeat Chorus

Break: Down
I'm so fresh
And so clean
We G'd up
And still lean
But now we skate with it
Better get with it
Gotta switch in it
Now drop when I hit it
Like this
And like that
All the girls love when we skate to the track
Just like this
And like that
Hey DJ, run it back, let me skate to that

Repeat Refrain

Repeat Chorus Twice</pre>
