Chorus (Misdemeanor):

I'm on lockdown but I'll be home in a minute,
Soon as I finish, in these cells there ain't no winnin',
I'm on lockdown but I'll be home in a minute,
Bet every penny, in these cells there ain't no winnin'
I'm on lockdown but I'll be home in a minute,
Soon as I finish, in these cells there ain't no winnin',
I'm on lockdown but I'll be home in a minute,
Bet every penny, in these cells there ain't no winnin'

First Verse (Misdemeanor):

But I'm in the system now for freedom,
My man in jail put them G's up,
Put the ki's up, thankin' Jesus,
But if they don't, then I'll be stuck up in this bitch,
They got me sick for thirty-fifth, lookin' at a year and six,
Aw shit my head smokin', wasn't down for jossin',
Court date approachin', I'm through until further notice,
Can't get no bond and shit,
Pumpin' iron and shit,
Wastin' time and shit,
My family cryin' and shit,
Oh well, I'm struck right chea, can't come up on a buck,
Got bad luck, fuck, I guess a nigga like me is stuck,
But I'm gone bounce ya heard me, believe what I said,
Ain't got a DA strong enough to keep a nigga like me in bed,
And all my dogs Upstate got life for rape,
Straight out the pen with the flavor in your face, aight?

Chorus

Second Verse (Prime Time):

Do you know who the fuck I be?
(P.T.)
Then you know never to fuck with me,
(from G.T.)
You round there reppin' and stuntin' you better do what'cha gotta do,
Beefin' with the seventeenth, shoot who you gotta shoot,
Cuz I be home in a year or two head bustin',
Split him wide open made him die from the head bustin',
See I'm known Uptown for bein' real, check my steelo,
Hit hoes on the D-Low, ain't no hero, P.T. below zero,
Enemies I make 'em bleed, chop 'em down like trees,
Like Japanese with two-23's, now clown please,
I'm full blooded, better get'cha mind out the gutter,
More slicker than butter, but nigga no shame in my color,
Now who this clown think he is?  Gonna run this til',
I paint a picture for him, cut him up, and show the bitch my skills,
