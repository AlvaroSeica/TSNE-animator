[Flesh-N-Bone]
You don't wanna see my Flesh (Flesh, Flesh...)

Chorus:
It's nothin' but the Bone in me
You don't wanna see my Flesh Bone
It's nothin' but the Bone in me
You don't wanna see me

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Feel thug shit pumpin' out of Cleveland
All up in your system, hittin it, and everybody move
No matter where you're from, come one and get with this
Here to make you party, body, so groove over to the Glock
The spot, we got it poppin' all day to get through the night
Swisha, fill 'em on up with the icky, sticky, sippin' liquor got you nice
Whip out the lighter, flame on up
It be to completely ? me up
Everyone, have a nice time, get along with your people
Don't wanna hear people fuss or cuss
If they do, then I crush 'em
Break every bone off in his body
'Cause all my people came here to have a wonderfultime, niggas
Everybody crashed the party
Once in awhile we can get a little wild
And ever now and then, I comin' out to show you how
In the Land, my city, the way we put it down
You know what it is, how to get to my town
Listen to the rythym
Hear this sound: (sirens) 
put you deep into a motion that just don't stop
Feel them coppers come knockin' on your door
Get you ass on the floor
We jack 'til we drop
Props, sendin' out shots to my trues
Been down with that nigga Flesh at the beginning and
niggas together 'til the very ending
And I'm hit after hit, and I'm still winnin'
And you wonder what it is in me that you really wanna roll
Then see Flesh gettin' busy with niggas that it be my thang
Nothin' but the Bone in me

Chorus

[Flesh-N-Bone]
I grip me a pipe with my heater
Call upon it, when I need her
Feedin' bullets to spit on ya corner
Think to test me?
Baby, you's a goner, loner
Somebody shouda been done warned, now
When ya on the thug show, nigga flex
Check out the Flesh, put it down
When your in the C-Town don't fuck those
You simple-minded
Don't you find it complicated?
Checkin' the best style
So I'm out get ? tryin' to clear a ?
Start none, nigga want my forty
Get a light, my sud's froze cold
So off to economies, hit up the store
And I'd love to thank for keepin' the drink I see for me
Get me Ides, get surprised, (copper stops .38) and mo' cheese
Get the with the Gs, set a destination, we're facin'
Finally I'm here (I'm here)
Hit me as I go pissy-drunk, breath stunk, puff spliff after spliff
Chinese - eyes sunk shut, near me pass my beeron to the next man
Goin' up to meet a pretty lady to get my boogie on for the next dance
No ?, her intentions was to get money, and let's face it, shame on you, honey
Bitch made it known she wanna fuck me because I'm a Bone
No threat, better yet I'm a pass up the ass and keep my cash
Leavin' women alone, and go stack up my bankroll
Flip paper, dollar, grab the dollar
Make me holler, feel it in me, nothin' but the Bone
