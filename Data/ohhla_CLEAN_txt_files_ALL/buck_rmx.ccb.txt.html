Bucktown USA is the place were I rest (That's right)
Were thoro thugs catch a slugs through the chest
And any day just may be the end
See the grim reaper be creeping these streets attempts
(Yo were the diamond and the gems) get up in'em Tek
Keep cowards in check earn this respect
I told you who I rep
Cus I was raised with a one track MIND
And one black NINE
[Tek]
I'm from the streets were a average man can become a killa
And it will be your own fam that get you for the scrilla
And my niggaz the double R crew rape and rob like they want to
Because that's what we into and what my mans do
I control that you know that I love peoples that show me love back
But disrespect Tek then I'm spitting it all
I'm the best imma thought I remind yall

(Chorus)
Bucktown
Grow were the grass is greener
And all the gods choose to call it Medina
Bucktown
The place were I've seen my roots
Got put on this route and got my first Tim boots
Bucktown
See me in the GS 3-0-0 in the side of the road
Getting harassed by popo
Bucktown
Home of my B-C-C and First Fam (running shit) First Family (What)

[Lil Fame]
What is home stilling homes kill it
Cus this pain we bring to'em they gonna feel it
I a rude awakening nobody safe
Fuck around I throw a Timberland print in your face
First down through the door we all brought wreck
Check the first video I'm gripping the steal tech Bucktown
Home of the homicide were the drama rise
The original insane criminal
[Steele]
Guns blazing wanted worldwide for hell raising
Hot like Cajun ST the amazing
Raised in Brooklyn by thugs and crooks that who robs
Be looking for straight drama
(And problem of the street with armor) Bucktown
Nigga you know revolution in Brooknam
Fire storm true born as we bomb like Sadaam
First Fam, Smiff N Wessen, Lil Fame, Billy Danze Tek N Steele
Through the battle field (strong we still standing) Bucktown

(Chorus:)
Bucktown
Grow were the grass is greener
And all the gods choose to call it Medina
Bucktown
The place were I've seen my roots
Got put on this route and got my first Tim boots
Bucktown
See me in the GS 3-0-0 in the side of the road
Getting harassed by popo
Bucktown
Home of my B-C-C and believe yeah yeah

[Steele]
We going all out
Throwing down to we all fall out
We all brawl out draw heat to send enemies to the morgue house
Homicide on the scene squad cars full of area
Mass hysteria my team a burry ya
[Billy Danze]
I hate to worry ya
Prepare for the havoc
If anybody move and I'll anybody have it
Is all tragic
When I'm stepping with the semi
To WORK'EM and HURT'EM in ways
The lord won't forgive me
[Tek]
For sinning with my peeps were dogs gotta eat
The calico is sweet put air under your feet
And leave you bubbled up
Have your family huddle up
The mack twins ones make the shots doubled up
[Lil Fame]
I'm game tight is Mr. Fizzy Wo say the name right
When is on imma hit'em and split'em the same night
"Shanghai" we do it Broke-lyn style
So when the guns pop tell'em all duck down we wrote

(Chorus)
Bucktown
Grow were the grass is greener
And all the gods choose to call it Medina
Bucktown
The place were I've seen my roots
Got put on this route and got my first Tim boots
Bucktown
See me in the GS 3-0-0 in the side of the road
Getting harassed by popo
Bucktown
Home of my B-C-C and every body that I fucked with this family

First Family, B-C-C Cocoa B, word up yo, huh
Brooklyn style mashing straight mashing...</pre>
