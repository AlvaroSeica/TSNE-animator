[Intro/Chorus One: Lil Rob]
Baby tell me what's up, because I'm feelin you
I'm lettin you know, I'm makin my move
I know the love shows, you got me talkin like this
I can't believe you got me talkin like this (whoahh-ohh)

[Lil Rob]
Girl tell me what's up, because I'm feelin you
I'm lettin you know, I'm makin my move
I know the love shows, you got me talkin like this
See I don't wanna be
Just another one of them guys who feed you lies
Girl you're too fine
As for my mind, well you blew mine
You got me feelin like I'm walkin on cloud nine
One of a kind, hard to find, but I found mine
Lose track of time, all I think about is you
On the tip of my tongue, all I speak about is you
And the way you do the things you do (whoahh)
Beautiful thoughts of just me and you
They say you see it too
Do you dream like I dream cause my dream is to be with you
When I close my eyes at night, all I see is you
And can't wait to wake up next to my dream come true
You see I know all I need is you
I'll never find a woman sweet as you - look what you made me do
I can't believe that you got me like this
Talkin like this, got me caught up lost in your mix

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: Lil Rob]
I want you, I need you, I think I love you
Damn, what am I sayin?  I can't believe you got me talkin like this
Whoahh-ohh, I want you, I need you, I think I love you
Damn, what am I sayin?  Damn girl I can't believe you got me talkin like this

[Lil Rob]
But then I heard you've taken, all you can take
That you're through with men after your last heartbreak
But I don't wanna be the one you hate
I want you wakin up every mornin feelin great
So great that you can't wait to go tell your friends
That you just found a happiness that never ends
I wanna tell my friends the same things too
How unhappy I was then came you
You make me feel brand new, you changed my view
I was fallin off beat, but now I'm right on cue
See I've been livin for the love of you
Look what you made me say, look what you made me do

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Lil Rob]
I never let nothin keep me from what I want
Can I pick you up tonight, on the weekend or what?
Just let me know when you got some time
Until then you know that you'll stay on my mind
I like what I know and definitely like what I see
Especially when I see you with me (there I go again)
I can't believe that you got me like this
Talkin like this, got me caught up, ain't that a bitch

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]</pre>
