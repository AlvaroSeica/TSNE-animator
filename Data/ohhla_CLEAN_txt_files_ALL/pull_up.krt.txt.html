[Chorus 2X: Big K.R.I.T.]
When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over
When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over
When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over
Better cuff your chick, this shit here legit, bitch

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Five in the morning, riding yawning, can't turn my beat up
On the way to a bopper with a crib that I can kick my feet up
See the candy was shining, freshly priming, first time I seen her
Now she wanna ride high with her head in the sky and look down on all her people
Ain't it crazy how pavement be cracking when I'm slabbing them Vogues?
Hoes go to jump in and can't find the handles on my doors
So much twerking and working in here, I should install a pole
for them strippers that love to suck and fuck and get-get down on the floor
Transformers can't with this, not the way my doors flip
Skyscraper tall when I creep and crawl, is that K.R.I.T. or a solar eclipse?
Rise of the apes in my trunk when my chariot swang down
Make the broke catch ghost like the Rapture approaching when my old school come around

[Chorus 2X]

[Big Sant]
Say bitch, I pulled up on the curb, straight peeled off wit' yo' girl
Say she wanna ride with a pimp, wanna get that dick that she deserves
Say my back seat softer than a pillow top, paint so wet that it hit the spot
And I'ma quench your thirst, that little nigga should have did it first
You was holding hands and I was in her purse, I'm getting throwed up under city lights
She right side checking lipstick, tryna make sure that her titties right
We in the parking lot with the trunk open and sipping
Standing outside the whip with the woodgrain wheel like it's 1996
Yeah trick, I'm 'Ridin' Dirty', Big Sant bitch, I know you heard me
Tryna get the 'Lac with the eighty-fo's, tag just gon' say beg for mercy
I just swerve and swang and bang it, beware cause a hoe might leave you hanging
Better let 'em know I'm forever holding, kicking doors open, pay what you owe me, I told 'em

[Chorus 2X]

[Bun B]
See pimping is what pimping is, and macking do what it feel like
Drip the drape with that chunky stitching, and fo's and Vogues so I peel right
Candy paint on that body mayne, chrome the grill and that woman
Them belts and buck's and fifth wheel on the trunk, you'll hear me knock when I'm coming
That bass so hard that it's numbing, that chrome so shiny it's blinding
Them seats so soft that I'm sinking in 'em, so it's no need to recline 'em
I drop the top and you see me, got different shit on each TV
Got one with Sopranos and one with The Wire, the one up front is Boardwalk Empire
Woodgrain wheel so goddamn new that sap come out when I grip it
I represent for that P.A.T. and that H, so hoe I'm still tipping
I chunk the deuce when I flip it, for my city I put on
R.I.P. to the Pimp, this UGK for life for real, and I'm gone

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
