[Photne - Intro]
It's Little Brother (uh-huh!)
Phonte, Big Pooh,  9th Wonder (heheheh..)
This how we doin it (Jeah!! Show 'em what's goin on, my nig)
Letï's get it goin, check it out

[Phonte]
They never shoulda told me to rhyme on this
Get real, LB and  ---- form unholy alliances
Solely for the purpose of rhyming is - recommended
You keep your eye on this
cause, I am this MC wit an iron fist
that, hammers out each style that I've invented
Hammers out each flows that I've presented
A solider for my squad like I enlisted
HOJ still swingin the guillotine
from here to the Philippines, it's just as I intended
Muh'fuckers still say dey ain't feelin me
You niggaz is killin me, it's just as I envisioned
And just as I have bended my flow over this track like contortionist
I ain't even gotta drop no more bars for this
Better dodge the draft, you don't want no war with this, c'mon!

[Chorus 2X: Phonte]
It goes, rock the party, rock-rock the party, rock
     I see you niggaz tryna cross that line
Don't stop the party, stop-stop the party, rock
     But I ain't finna let you steal my shine

[Kardinal Offishall]
Yo, I am now who's with an iron fist
I am one of the last standing true ly-ricist
Look in my irises, all of my words insist
on bein consistent, I hope that you fine wit dis
Whether you signed to backpack and I'm killin all of you
wack-winding, flowin off-time and weak-minded - (never mind)
My mind sprays like AKs' and Lebanon (BBBBBBBBRRRR!!!)
Speech is mad colorful like ice cream and Benetton
Fuck up a nigga real QUICK!! - and that's the shit I'm on
Take out EMCEEEEEEES!!! - Once-A-Day like a vit-amon
CHEA!! A rap vitamin, my circle stays tighter than
a virgin on birth control - I'm like a leviathan
When {?} to put the trite and they {?} MOTIF!!
Iï've been declared a world THREAT - when 9th Wonder's on the BEAT!
(CHEA!!!) Phonte, Big Pooh, and the Justus League
A lotta rappers soudin like they put crack in dey weed
BLACK JAYS!!

[Chorus 2X: Phonte, Kardinal Offishall]
It goes, rock the party, rock-rock the party, rock
     CHEA! I see you niggaz tryna cross that line
Donï't stop the party, stop-stop the party, rock
     Yea, and I'll be damned if you steal my shine, c'mon!

[Rapper Big Pooh]
(BIG POOH!!) You in the presence of one of the greats
Ask niggaz from state to state, they say "Rapper"
I'm in the midst of your hoes chit-chatter
Glassjaw niggaz get shattered; I'm not flattered
Fried-chicken niggaz get battered
then laced with a {?} to served on a platter, HOT!
Right here if you want it or not
Got a mean 16 that came off the top
Ain't have no dough, walked off the lot
Came back next week and cop, I got some old shit
So when I go to the lab, I let my soul spit
I'm light years in front of my foes
My Chi-Town niggaz be like, "Pooh, you so cold"
In H-Town, they be like "Poobie gettin th'owed"
Wool parka trench straight down to the flo'
We the Trillest muh'fuckers in the South, yee ain't kno?!

[Chorus 2X: Phonte, Rapper Big Pooh]
It goes, rock the party, rock-rock the party, rock
     I see you niggaz tryna cross that line
Don't stop the party, stop-stop the party, rock
     But I ain't bout to let you steal my shine</pre>
