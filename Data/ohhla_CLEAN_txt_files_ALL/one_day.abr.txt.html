[Verse 1: Jesse Abraham]
I drink a, a shot of pain
A glass of death
A death of glass
Back in Nazareth we
We passed the test we
We asked for less
We turn the cheek, with merit we inherit
The spirit and the free
The mirror is the miracle
The nearer we would be
If fearing the empirical's comparable to weak
So lyrical we speak
If literal you seek, you thought you sought the wrong route
Talkin bout everything my mind ever thought about
Blocking out blacking out
Cracking down now I'm
Like lightning and thundering
Not tightening my dungarees
It's frightening to wonder who is underneath
My writing
It's nobody
My mind is mine
And I'm inclined to shine bright as fire I'm tryin to find my own design
So behind time I noticed I'm focused on the climb
The world is round
So up is out
I heard a sound
Love is shouting
Screamin, dreamin about a breathing demon I'm beaming light
Seeming bright need to be breathing steam if I'm redeeming my

[Hook: Eric Sosa]
Mind, I feel that I can
Redeeming my soul
I think that I will
You ain't got to listen
I know who I am
Can't nobody tell me different
Wouldn't change it for a mil
I ain't givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain't givin up mind, body, soul
Said I ain't givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain't givin up mind, body, soul
I ain't givin up my
Mind, body, soul
I'll be good one day
I'll be good one day
I'll pro'lly grow
I'll be good one day
I'll be good one day

[Bridge: Eric Sosa]
One day will it come x4

[Verse 2: Eric Sosa]
It come sooner than you think
Sooner than you blink
So pour all the rumors down the sink and
Look at yourself in the vanity
Cloaked in your sanity
Don't let yourself melt in a pan of greed
In a pot of hate
I got a lot to say
So I approach it like it's corporate and it's not for play
If I ain't focused, put a fork in it, and not the steak
See I just noticed, it's the cautious shit I gotta take
Battle from within
Beefin from a distance
Like I have to win if I speak it into existence
Wide and fooled and avoiding whether this could sell
Tired of the bullshit with a toilet as a wishing well
So I demand that you stop killing his dreams
Standing on a rooftop of a building in Queens
Squinting while I'm cooking up the Cuban
I ain't lookin for the man in me
I found that
I'm lookin for the human

[Hook: Eric Sosa]
Mind, I feel that I can
Redeeming my soul
I think that I will
You ain't got to listen
I know who I am
Can't nobody tell me different
Wouldn't change it for a mil
I ain't givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain't givin up mind, body, soul
Said I ain't givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain't givin up mind, body, soul
I ain't givin up my
Mind, body, soul
I'll be good one day
I'll be good one day
I'll pro'lly grow
I'll be good one day
I'll be good one day

[Verse 3: Jesse Abraham]
Everything I do is rock n roll
Every time I think I've got control
It turns out ink doesn't got a soul
I don't know how to go from normal all the way back to radical
Static or havoc it's a habit
Tragic is magical
A biblical sabbatical
Seven days, seven years
OK, then will I have it?
Novocain's saying no to pain
Plain days aggravate
Sane ways agitate
Can you imagine it?
A castaway
My stomach's knotted
Even if I passed away I'd have to say the summit's rotted
Cuz that is not it
I'm searching for a paragon
If I am gone &amp; you are gone
There, that's a pair of gones
A marathon
Let's walk it out
Love, vibrations
That's what I'm talking bout
Fats Waller nodding out
On the train, riding round
Sight and sound they might abound but might is trite if it's not profound
I'm antilost
Why can't I cross Kate Moss with weight loss?
I hate when you say pause
There's only none
The holy sun
Amongst a clan of bullets
Standing is a lonely gun

[Hook: Eric Sosa]
Mind, I feel that I can
Redeeming my soul
I think that I will
You ain't got to listen
I know who I am
Can't nobody tell me different
Wouldn't change it for a mil
I ain't givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain't givin up mind, body, soul
Said I ain't givin up my mind, body, soul
I ain't givin up mind, body, soul
I ain't givin up my
Mind, body, soul
I'll be good one day
I'll be good one day
I'll pro'lly grow
I'll be good one day
I'll be good one day</pre>
