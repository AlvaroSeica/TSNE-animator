[Intro/Chorus: Chuck D &amp; (Flavor)]
I smell a new Whirl Odor (RIOTS!!)
I smell a new Whirl Odor (Y'ALL!!)
I smell a new Whirl Odor (IS GOING DOWN!!)
I smell a new Whirl Odor (RIOTS!!)
I smell a new Whirl Odor (Y'ALL, CRISIS!!)
I smell a new Whirl Odor (IS GOING DOWN!!)
I smell a new Whirl Odor (RIOTS!!)
I smell a new Whirl Odor (COME ON!!)
 
[Verse One: Chuck D]
Chake your soul in cause the tape is rolling
The black don't crack, where the party at, stacks
Jump back, COME ON!! - wax them tracks
Johnny Juice cutting live like them Home 45s
Strong song surviver on them quick ass records
95 beats per second, PE wrecking
Now, the color of dead looks like your future is history
Now, why you're dissing me? - cause it ain't no mystery
On the outside peeking in, end of your free ride 
No way you can win, because it's beginning of the end
Of your liberal friends who.. sometimes pretend 
Everything has changed, while nothing has changed much
Uhh.. don't you know, this is Chuck D?
Stays to the left of this, and to the right of that
Just black, don't you know, where my mind be at?
Shit!! I wanna know where is the rest of cats
High trees be catching a lot of wind my friend
I smell a new Whirl Odor
 
[Break: Flavor Flav]
Look Out! 
Here we go again ---------&gt; Chuck D
Yeaaah Boyyy!
Public Enemy -------------&gt; Sample of a media 
AWWWWWWW Daaaammnn
RIOTS!! COME ON!!
CRISIS!! GOING ON!!
 
[Chorus: Flavor Flav]
 
[Verse Two: Chuck D]
I flock to refugees who flock to me
The roots, the coup√©, and kick aside the genocide of the jews
Comedians, actors, nuclear reactors, players and ball players
Singers, dancers and rhyme says
Why do us like you do? - Ska Doo fuck the residue
Frustrated five on twos, no breaks for mad crews
Now, who the fuck is you? - cause we're sick of you
Now, who the fuck is you? - cause we're sick of you
Community hoeses, who be posing as Moses
And the street clothist, who be the closet as blouses
Now, every rhyme be for the future of mindkind
Crazy heads, they be cutting off their dreds
Ruining health, with little knowledge of self
Income taxes breaking off the backs of the blacks
Who done four hundred years in this Abyss
So I'm pissed, sort of fuck at this New Whirl odor
 
[Chorus: Flavor Flav]
 
[Verse Three: Chuck D]
Some things in the air, when the smoke clears
Will it only be white folks and nothing but black jokes?
How many be gone if they bombed Barbershops and Hair Salons?
It's time to Dot Com, time to Dot Com
Before they rub out clubs where you get your drink on
Mother, father, sister, bro, love is a message
But War be the front page in this mess age
Ghetto celebs spread by the hundreds 
Macked by the same tactics
With us in a tundra, going under
Avoiding cries from sodimized society
It's scary getting screwed without a Dictionary!!
It's scary getting screwed without a Dictionary!!
It's scary getting screwed without my Dictionary!!

[Outro: Chuck D]
Everything just wiped out ---&gt; Media Sound
The world is a ball of confusing
The world is a ball of confusing
The world is a ball of confusing
The world is a ball of confusing</pre>
