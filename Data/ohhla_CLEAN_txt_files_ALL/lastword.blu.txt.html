[Blue Raspberry]
In the beginning every was fine, between you and I
I didn't think we would catch feelings, the way we did
Now it's time for me to say goodbye
Why can't you leave me alone
Take no for an answer, I don't understand
You have every one you want, and more, and more
I can not just be by myself, without you
I remember not to long ago
You were the sweetest person to me
And right now, I just don't know
But, in order to get over you, I need to lose our communication
That would be better for us
Cuz you don't know what you've done to my heart
People just wonder why, I am with you, I don't know what to say
Cuz I can see the changes in you, more and more each day
You don't understand what you've done
You could be nice at one point and then you leave me alone
Instead I'm going back and forth, with you
I have to let go of you, of you
There's no future in you and me
I can't tell you how many times I said the same thing</pre>
