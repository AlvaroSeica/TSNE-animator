[Rick Ross]
Ross
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
Port of Miami - uhh, port of my candy - uhh
Ain't got nuttin to lose - nah
We supportin the family
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
Never traffic for fun.. only traffic for funds
All I seen is the struggle, it's like I'm trapped in the slums
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
Workers are barely paid, no water we barely bathe
There better be better days on the way that's on my daddy grave
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
I'm pushin it hard.. I'm pushin it South
If he pushin a line.. he pushin for Ross
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
I waited and waited.. I done ran out of patience
They hated and hated, left him slow dancin with Satan
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
Fresh in my white tee, mac-11 swear to God
I bought my first block, broke it down and to' the block apart
 {"Push it to the limit!"}

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I push and I push (PUSH) I ride and I ride (RIDE)
Tryin to survive on 95
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
Put it all on the line (line) every drop of a dime (dime)
I be pushin them whips (whips) yep, three at time
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
I'm pushin it (push) I'm pushin it (push)
I'm pushin it (push) I gotta {"Push it to the limit!"}
I'm pushin it (push) I'm pushin it (push)
I'm pushin it (push) I gotta {"Push it to the limit!"}

[Rick Ross]
I handle dope like a vandal off the banana boat
Bananas and our rifles, no cyphers I'm just demandin mo'
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
I paid dues, my mood's to make moves
I'm smooth, my suede shoes they new like {?}
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
Nobody used to speak, now e'rybody wait
You duck your momma house, you set your sister straight
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
I'm buildin a dream, with elevators in it
Tailor made the linen no gators got on my hater-vision
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
I see ya, I see ya suckers, I see ya clear
I know you see me in that Phantom white and it's veneers
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
Allergic to broke.. determined to blow
On the boat we handle work in detergent and soap
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
Uhh and we ship it from Haiti, baby I'm whippin them babies
Let it dry later, try to whip a Mercedes
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
Arrange my Range, y'all can't arrange a parade
You gotta push it to the limit you wanna be paid

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
We started minute, the money matures
My money's secured, I got bunnies in Europe
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
My bubble be pure it cost like a hundred a pull
The world is yours, hundred million or more
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
Now I run the streets (Ross) they all mine (Ross)
12 years overdue call it due time
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
I told you never roll on the soul of a soldier
You never know that dishwasher may be the beholder
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
Whoever thought that fat girl would grow into Oprah
Or that boy Rick Ross would be moldin the culture
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
I push and push.. we breakin the mold
We push and we push.. we rapin the hoes
 {"Push it to the limit!"}
