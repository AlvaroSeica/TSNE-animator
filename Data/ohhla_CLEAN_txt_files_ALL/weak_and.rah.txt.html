Song:   Weak &amp; Strong
Typed by: Quest Rah

In the midst of the sirens
Tanks heavy iron
A smoked waste land
Stand the defying
princes of resistance
Look death in the eyes'n
The faces of a cub
but the hearts of a lion
armed with an arm full Â‘a rocks
vs napalm
firearms stay calm enemies alarmed
pull back  ------ blow
the catapult slingshot child
bulls eye precision
who's the weak one
you stand behind ammunition
listen you fear the ones weak in resources
you know their heart force throws you of course
of course you show no remorse
leaders just talk
while the hawks hover bomb drop
he trades in his toy for a rock
use earth to fight those who don't respect the land they walk on
the strong in the heart live on
while your status is zero
this kids like a third of my age but
yo thats my hero</pre>
