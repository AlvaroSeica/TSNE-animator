(*talking*)
This here, is for the grown and sexy
That's qualified, to the be with a real special player
Like myself

[Mr. 3-2]
I'm in love with a squal, that don't love me
Spend all my money, on a H-O-E
Cause tricking is a habit, that I need to stop
Eating at IHOP, with a Chinese bop
She cream of the crop, with a Visa card
Ride brand new Benz, sitting in the garage
Menage with her friends, when she feeling fly
On excellent tabs, and we both so high
I'd buy her the world, if she asked for that
With a Gucci purse, and the shoes to match
I snatch your bread, off in these streets
And protect myself, with a plastic key
Beat knocking in the trunk, when we crawling down
Two deep she sweet, weigh a hundred pounds
Let's pop us a pill, and then hit the freeway
Take off your shoes, and have it your way

[Hook with Swab - 2x]
That's baby, I'd do anything for her
That's baby, both of us in our furs
That's baby, we don't ever fuss or fight
In church on Sunday, looking nice

[Mr. 3-2]
Now baby, ain't gon' settle for less
When we step out smelling good, looking fresh
I guess, I don't put in quality time
Do some'ing lil' different, we both gon' shine
I'm grown got green, and having a ball
Pulling up valet, standing ten feet tall
Small thangs don't bother a dude, like Chris
While these boys steady chasing, attraction bitch
Ms. due you got a plan, and she spoken fo'
I got baby, but she ain't tripping though
Meet a mack at the bar, let me buy you a drank
Don't cap back, act like your shit don't stank
Think I can't get up, in that greasy spot
Taking you out to shop, in my brand new drop
Out of town vacations, ain't nothing to us
Never get into it, while we on the hush

[Hook - 2x]

[Mr. 3-2]
My partners lame, joke around
On a brother like me, cause I love this thang
Cause she look out for me, when I'm doing bad
Writing me out a check, and I trick it fast
Cause cash it come, and cash it go
Cash don't make us, sometimes I don't know
How to express myself, and say how I feel
But I love my boo-boo, that's on the real
Put a ring on her finger, cause she special to me
Leave the boppers alone, good don't call me
Baby laying up pretty, at my home
A woman ass grown, I can't leave alone
Educated independent, want some'ing in life
Had to sacrifice, had to get my stuff right
Now it's looking all gravy, in my future time
On a whole 'nother page, and I'm feeling fine
