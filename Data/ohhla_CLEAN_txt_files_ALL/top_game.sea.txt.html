[Rahzel]
It's the return of the microphone fiend
I be the first nigga to split ya spleen
Impair ya vision, leave ya cataract split-screen
You'll be assed out, passed out like Mitch Green (Green)
Fight Club, from a Brad Pitt scene
I'm a SWAT Team, spittin' a hot sixteen
A pimp's steen, is makin' ya chick scream (unhh)
Download my digital, digital voice stream
*Vocal static* Automatic wide-screen
Lowrider, with them buggy-eyed beams
A bad freak, in the back seat, named Ming Ling
Last week, them bad streets, was in full swing
For my brothers locked down in G.P. to Sing Sing
*Vocal scratches* Sean Paul, Dancehall king
*Vocal noises* The track like a puppet on a string

[Sean Paul]
From a set a dem any time dem come arouna
Dem hole a dis dem a waan try fi take ya crowna
Dem waan fi see ya han a growna
But di badman a wears a crowna
Come a bun a Dutty babylona
Yo becaw me see dem a plan a to try fi come tek over me zona
Say dem a try fi tek me ting like it now dem owna
Dem di kinda ting dat kinda a hurt me corizona
So me turn dem into organ donors
Escape an a bed to Barcelona with Fiona and Iona
Floakin wit a pound of home growna
One a dem gal a rub pon my shoulder
One a pour a club soda, plus I like di flight controla
Tell dem

[Chorus: Sean Paul] (Rahzel)
On top of the game I'll stay (Number one)
Nobody cyaan out my flame (Champion)
We tell dem again and again (Number one)
We ready fi drive dem insane (champion)
[repeat]

[Sean Paul]
It's all about my love for it
All about di tings that me give up for it
All about di years up inna di club for it
Me sweat for it, me tough for it
Boy waan come treat man like bruk for it
An gal you so say man all a suffer it
No dem discover it
Waan fi bring dey bread fi me fi butter it
Just true di true, me a hotter it
I know me nuh guh sweater it
Even dis try tell dem nuh guh suffer it
None a dem cyaan dung sight of it
Caw music is my heart, and it's in my brain
Inna me soul, it tek control, me feel it there an plain
When di vibe dem start, weh yuh cyaan complain
When di music a hit, yuh kno yuh feel nuh pain

[Chorus: Sean Paul] (Rahzel)
On top of the game I'll stay (Number one)
Nobody cyaan out my flame (Champion)
We tell dem again and again (Number one)
We ready fi drive dem insane (champion)
[repeat]

[Rahzel]
{*vocal scratches*} Sean Paul

[Sean Paul]
Watch di rat race, dem a run, dem nuh age, run in it
Di pussies dem a come fi try fi tek out di fun in it
Dem a two face, a gwaan push see me gun in it
Any ting start, an I'm dun in it
Best believe, I'm run in it

Mek man yuh break like dey super-son-in-ic

Combine with mine, every time, we keep dun in it

[Chorus: Sean Paul] (Rahzel)
On top of the game I'll stay (Number one)

On top of the game I'll stay (Number one)
Nobody cyaan out my flame (Champion)
We tell dem again and again (Number one)
We ready fi drive dem insane (champion)
