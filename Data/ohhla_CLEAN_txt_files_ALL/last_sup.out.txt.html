[Crypt the Warchild]
I ain't trying to win the battle I'ma win the war
I don't dance in the club dawg I dance wit wolves
Sip on the fine potion, enhance my thoughts
Spit murder death kill, I can't get caught
Been sick so long I think I need a clinic
You got tons of guns, ok we get it
I'ma true emcee see I don't need a gimmick
Don't wanna build wit y'all unless you mean digits
And I don't get invovled wit you weak bitches
I keep my problem solved put 'em in deep ditches
You'se internet hoe, you trying to network
You make a few bucks at show, what is your net worth?
Waiting on my downfall, don't hold your breath first
And if your squad run deep I push a stretch hearse
Y'all all welcomed to the jungle where the Vet lurk
Where Kamach and Celph Titled I hope that vest work

(Chorus) Planetary 2x
There's nothing you can say to us
Too many niggas hating us
Its outta line, we outta time
So start spraying them up
Kamach laying in the cut
We bread breaking it up
AOTP!!! Ain't nobody greater then us

[Celph Titled]
I dash outta my bat cave, wit black shades
A fresh fade and an Onyx mad face
This is the deadliest rap you discovered
We overflow storm drains bring it back to the gutta
And no you couldn't match to my voice from speech course
I talk raspy, I'ma animal, I speak horse
My vocal chords is Tyrannosaurus
And the coordinates from the signal in space went undistorted
Says that I'm more Mormon, more then purpose abortion
Amongst dead swordfish sort of corpse assortment
Army swordsman, Pharaoh Marksmen
We got canonist of carnage, barrels of arsine
I'm heralded often as one of underground raps
Wildest, illest, greatest, sickest and vengeance
Of spitting image of a Satanic spawn
Wit eight mechanic arms
Make a fist in each one will bless you wit a cannon ball

[Planetary]
I don't write my freestyle that's some New York shit
If it's written the composition cost a few more chips
I'm Illadelph born, scorned by the Bush administration
Hopefully Barack can help the children get some motivation
I'ma punish every politician try to hurt my babies
I hope McCain OD off cocaine wit his lady
But anyway back to the rap dungeon circumference
My comfort zone is attract to make niggas wanted to throw punches
You lunge then I'm leaping, you front I'm feasting
You bumming I'm beasting, it ain't nuttin to beat 'em
Till the blood is underneath 'em
I bring the thunder even if the sun a hundred beaming
Six million ways to die, here go a hundred keep 'em
I'ma fucking demon, bitch nigga guzzle semen
Like cheerleaders on the side, what's the fucking reason?
Y'all niggas look like water boys on stage
Type of niggas that I pray gets on the part wit the gauge

(Chorus) Planetary 2x

[Chief Kamachi]
Yeah, African Priest, Dashiki's wit bullet holes
Try to kill me I get in the casket befo bullet close
My whole angle serpentine in the rainbow
Spit voodoo rap, hear it in the Haitian-Congo
Daily is the break dance, mind in the straight trance
Old school murdah, arms crossed in a great stance
'80s style dirty Louis Vuitton
You talk Mob shit but I really flew them to Milan
Between the Crypt and Planet
Straight from the strip wit advantage
But from the Heavens I'm banished
Yeah! But the sevens will manage
Cuz the sixes is bitches
Five pointed stars on the stage, slitting their wrists
Scorched by the beautiful eyes of the Pharaohs mistress
Number 1 on the mythical hit list, I am this
Just look at the way the gem glist
Messiah Marley, keep some Solomon stems twist

(Chorus) Planetary 2x

(Outro) Chief Kamachi (Celph Titled)
Ah (Rock-rock-on)
Y'all know what it is
(OS rock-rock-on)
AOTP nigga (Rock-rock-on)
Celph Titled (Rock-rock-on)
OS (Rock-rock-on)
Chief Kamachi (Rock-rock-on)</pre>
