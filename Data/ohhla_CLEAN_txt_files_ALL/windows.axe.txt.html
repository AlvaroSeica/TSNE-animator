[Long Axe]
The torture get the misfortunate passing it to them
Red eyes like Malcolm's hairline
Inside the open window, see the street behind the iron curtain
People hurting to live more certain
Squirting water guns, spraying real ones
They're making real funds, still we'll chill some
Arrogant, approaching death, no regard on respect
Man down, keep your head up, the only one left
It's a set up, keep ducking
Like Hendrix finger on the trigger keep plucking
Bullets got wings now, fly in your direction
That weeping willow was your only protection
Sparks keep dancing, feel emancipated
Adrenalin got them kind of feminine
Emotions overflowing like riots outside your apartments
Should have took a chill pill, but the streets not swallowing
Young boys following a path for the wrong thug step dad
Momma feeling bad, pockets on empty
The only thing going on the side of the fridge is the light
But the hustlers eat right, speak ear candy
DAP with cracks in it, tats with flacks in it
Live by the sword and you're bound to roll over
Wake up with nothing but a tonne on shoulders
A time is like a folder, you can open it up
You can put it away or even throw it away
Waste not, want not, we'll not recuperate

[Chorus: female singer]
We have to believe
We have only ourselves to grieve
With that we will achieve, our real dreams
Maybe we'll see, maybe we'll see
If we just make them beats
More religious dreams...

[Long Axe]
You needed to, you know the kind that screams like
9mm that will push your bullets back
But then you living in a cell with no windows
Listening to Wu-Tang, "can it be that simple"
Nah, high demands got that weed in your system
Malfunctioning adopted by the system
Letters from your fans keep the situation bearable
Grandma crying 'cause her grandson's terrible
Wrong choices you listen to the wrong voices
Peer pressure just sent you in forever
Then you remember that old head, old bred
Grey hairs growing from his old dreads
Cold stares tried to warn you but you didn't take heed
You been hard up in that moment of greed, indeed

[Chorus]</pre>
