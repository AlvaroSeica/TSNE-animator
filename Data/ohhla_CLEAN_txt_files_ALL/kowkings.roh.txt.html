[Intro]
Kings...
Reign...
Supreme...

[Chorus]
K, O, W, KINGS! {*3X*}
We, have, locked, this, down
K, O, W, KINGS! {*3X*}
We, have, got, the, crown

[Cody B. Ware]
Wrapped on our waist
Crowd goin wild, we are packin the place
Hero, Claudio, the Ace and the Queen
Turn up the audio, you hearin what I mean?
The Kings of Wrestling, second to none
Finish the competition quicker with the KRS-ONE
The Roaring Elbow, the European Uppercut son
Ricola Bomb, Last Kick, they vision is DONE!
I repeat, competition is NONE!
Once the bell rings, get your bell RUNG!
The greatest team in the history of wrestling
If you think other then prepare for the reckoning
Elbow deafening, giant swing helicopter
I concuss with my kicks and I K.O.
See we get the J-O, B, finished
So if you want a war you will end up diminished~!

[Chorus]

[Cody B. Ware]
Loyal to the game
Family, fuck the money and the fame
No one will ever be the same
Once we walk through the curtain and they callin out our names
(KINGS~!) From the bottom to the top
The reign's just begun it will never ever stop
'Til a botch drops, 'til we six feet to our death
And this K-O-W are simply the best
Put to test every team that you dream
Put a fiend on they soul, ask my homeboy Skeme
We the best in the world
Might catch us at the crib, bench pressin your girl or
See us on the mat in a five star match
Put the flame to the rest with the gas and the match
The King of the K.O., Very European
Bring a fight to your door it don't matter where you bein

[Chorus]</pre>
