I got my granny up knocking at my bedroom door but I'm..
Still Slizzard from the night before
I got my patna in da lac talkin bout let's go but I'm..
Still Slizzard from the night before
He say he bout to let the fire hit the tip of the dro but I'm..
Still Slizzard from the night before
I'm tryna get my shit my shit together but I still move slow cuz I'm..
Still Slizzard from the night before

It was Monday night, I was down at Magic's
just me, Jeezy and Jody you know we causin habits
I'm on dat Henny straight, Dro minus the flake
Wit a mobsta plate, eatin shrimp and steak
They got the music bumpin', big ass tities jumpin
we feelin' ignant, so we holler at BITCH FUCK SUM
you know I'm from the dirty, you we keeps it crunk
We past tipsy in this bitch dawg we dead drunk
Jeezy just threw ten thousand single on the fuckin floor
That's when I was like Man, it's time for me to go
I can't drank no mo' I can't even score
Gots to be up on your toes fuckin round with these hoes
One minute you gettin your dick sucked the next minute you ice cold
These bitches ain't really real they just know how top
play they roll but to a real nigga they game gone always be exposed

[Chorus]
I'm in the spot I got ya patna I'm the doctor
I can spot ya Gee
I'm the one in the back with the Timberlands on
Got ya man
I'm at the table with the dymes all kind holmes
Finga gettin they clitty warm, drunk as hell
