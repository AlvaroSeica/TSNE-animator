Always after my Lucky Charms and shit
Apple Jacks and shit like that

[ Scarface ]
Once upon a time at the Honeycomb Hideout
Sugar Bear and Mikey sat alone gettin fried out
Lucky walked in with this nigga name Rice Grain
Pulled out a knot and conjured up a dice game
Lucky looked at Mikey and he said with a smile
Where's the silly rabbit, I ain't seen him in a while?
Mikey turned to Lucky, shook his head cause he ain't know
Probably trickin with this bitch from Rocky Road named Cheerio
I'm trippin off this shit cause I ain't never seen it right
I'm feelin kind of leary cause I'm higher than a kite
This vibe has really got me on this other level
It's time to mark a murder, my victim's Fruity Pebbles
I'm killin any motherfucker jumpin in my mix
I'm out to get you Pebbles, heard the bitch was turnin tricks
I'm packin up my shit, I'm longin for some red cock
Ups, ain't this a bitch, Face is on his way to Bedrock
Shortly after gettin there I met up with the freak
Nearly cuttin the bitch in half like some Shredded Mini Wheats
I'm makin my escape, sneakin out the back
Fuck, I'm bein spotted by this fag named Apple Jack
I put it on his ass so he couldn't come back to key me
Bleedin like a hog, I guess he musta ate his Wheaties
He used to kiss dicks with his partner Special K
I never had respect for homosexuals anyway
I'm on my way to Houston, played it safe I rode the ferry
And ran across this motherfuckin cop named Frankenberry
He's starin at a niggam, had the looks as if he knows me
He asked about the Bear, I said, Yeah, the Bear's my homie
The shit was kind of shadyk, I was nervous from the jump
Arrivin at the docks he got the word from Captain Crunch
Arrested for a murder, so now I'm thinkin, Shit
I didn't know that Captain Crunch was Cuckoo for this bitch
My trial came up and now I'm thinkin guilt
This dried up situation needs a little bit of milk
I had a half a gallon and ( ? ) a nigga bought it
Reached and grabbed my spoon and made a motherfuckin run for it
I ate 'em up and washed 'em down with Miller
Mr. Scarface AKA your Cereal Killer
