Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Intro/Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty livin behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble, if I should fall
Would anyone hear me screamin behind these castle walls?
There's no one here at all
Behind these castle walls

{*11 second instrumental*}

[T.I.]
Observin the estate through the gate from the outside lookin in
Bet you would think I got it made, better look again
I got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion
The belief is that I'm livin out a millionaire's fantasy
with Phantoms and Ferraris in the driveway
But you see it came in exchange of a sane man's sanity
Your vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses, you will see the agony
Apparently it's damagin the man you see before you
On the canvas it may seem aight but all the disadvantages
his family encounters overshadows his extravagance
Walk in my nines a while, I dare you it'll scare you
While it surely seem like the king's life seem glamorous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles
on the castle 'til it falls in the piles

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Honestly to me I think I'd lose every benefit
of all that I've accomplished if my kids never went at shit
Me knowin this why should the verses I've laid
be more important to me than the persons I've raised?
I guess I'm sayin that to save the opportunities
The day just don't equate to all the time it take away
From the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake
if Deyjah end up a stripper and Major out slingin yay
How could I ever consider myself a great
if Messiah ain't paid and 'Nique-'Nique ain't straight?
Would your favorite song 'bout the whips, money and shit
be relevant if you found out Domani wasn't rich?
Nope, so me bein the GOAT
shouldn't mean more to me than see it to a King though
From a bad-ass kid to a man with some dough
Otherwise I may of well have stayed po'
So while they stay focused on me beefin with Flip and Shawty Lo
With Gucci or Ludacris, or if I'm fuckin with a hoe
Did I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense?
Internally I'm dealin with this conflict
So excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand
Or slap me in the face, ay I'm just a man
If they sayin I ain't the best at makin hit records
It's cause this my life, these ain't just rappin
Bet you ain't think it all live was that deep, did ya dawg?
See you can't see the castle fall of walls 'til it falls
Bet you ain't think it was that deep, did ya dawg?
Cause see you can't see the castle fall of walls 'til it falls

[Chorus]

[Christina Aguilera]
Nobody knows I'm all alone
Livin in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom
But I feel trapped inside it all
And while I sit so high up on a throne
I wonder how I can feel this low
On top of the world is beautiful
But there's no place to fall

[T.I.]
For the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again
My career was meant for me to come and tell it
Honest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with
Matters most rappers choose to keep locked away in a basement
If the day that I walk away they ain't sayin that I'm amazin
Downplayin the way I kept fellas from catchin cases
Won't take in consideration how much it mean when I'm sayin
And when I say what I mean even when surrounded by the fakers
From one of the greatest centers blessed with most of God's graces
who made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places
So next time you ratin royalty
I'm always bein given to recordings than the level of your loyalty
You obviously been ignorin me
Who else you've seen make it through the storm unharmed this charmly?
While all the critics was lookin for Prince Charming
Disregard that the King of the South has raised doubt
Even though he made a castle out what used to be a house
Did shit that all your favorite rappers only rapped about
But most of y'all don't see the castle full of walls and the smiles
'til it falls in the piles, so while
