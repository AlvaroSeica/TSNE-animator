[Intro: Cno Evil]
Yo, check it, yo

[Cno Evil]
No doubt, kick in the door, crash through your house
Then kick my feet up, and just, crash on your couch
Controller surfing, History Channel, I'm steady learning
Discovering new ideas, mind touring, rhyme yearning
Lines burning, words put holes right through your paper
Wooden darts on fire, have Smokey Bear come save ya
Only you can prevent yourself from doing wack tracks
Your addiction, is diction fiction, you lack facts
My diagram consists of a gentle tranquility
You like, I Am Sam, with developmental disability
Responsibility, with the swift agility
I turn your power off, like you didn't pay utility
I roll with '06 World Cup winners, who laugh at death
Pirate style, put a bullet right through a 'dead man's chest'
I'm like Johnny Depp's Edward Scissorhands; depressed
Kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug then I jet
I'm the official savior of hip hop, I'm getting older
Looking at your artificial flavors, like a can of a soda
Right Guart Xtreme, I fight hard, but it seems
That I'm being turned on by members of my own team
Scoring goals in their own net, so what do you expect?
I can just accept that fact and not be upset? That's disrespect
So I select to reflect on the subject
I can correct the next project to be perfect

[Li-Mouse]
Aiyo, this shit, makes me wanna, spit, right now
Knock everything out of my path with iron fists, like blaow
Lose your hearing in my ears, like you was Foxy
Hit me with everything, you won't get blood from rocks, be
I will not, be one, with nothing in the cranium
At first, they were nice, but now, we're training them
For authentic combat, requires this massive knowledge
No, this is impossible, to find in any college
This is hip hop, nigga, yeah, that's what we do
Everyday we getting bigger, watch how we go through
Trials, tribulations, man, what struggles?
But I'll rise like Pepsi and Coke, with them bubbles
Then pop at the top, balloons in the stratosphere
We don't spit darts no more, yo, Cno pass those spears
It's definite, that we are utmost unstoppable
You attempt, wristbands you receive from the hospital
Trust me, I ain't one of those old time kids that rap
Nor will I claim to have ever carried a strap
But with that fact, I keep my mind in keen and intact
Just in case I need to destroy you with a great big smack
Across your cheek, nose, ears, eyes, and mouth
Please don't provoke, don't choose such a deadly route
Stop swinging, cuz one strike, man, with me, and you're out
Front on me, man, fuck you, man, it's Mouse

[Outro: Li-Mouse]
Word up, I don't even know what I said</pre>
