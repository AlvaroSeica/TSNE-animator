Dear Tasha
it's quote unquote ya one and only baby
I wrote this out cause in person I know you tried to shake me
cause yous a thin line type of hoe
I wanna fight hoe
kitchen knife hoe
ya psycho!
I admit I slipped I should've knew you was a stupid hoe
thinking I shot a cupid's bow
but little do you know
I been fucking other nigga bitches, yep
that's the way to hit 'em
cause she'll keep shut and keep up her relationship with him
Remember Tim with the rim shop
that your friend brought to meet us and the clique
his bitch be loving the dick
Remember Nicholas that once lived with us
who be sniffing dust his wife like leather whips and cuffs
Remember Marcus who sold us two dimes for the 15
how he hit that hoe? Uh-uh he need to get that bitch cleaned
Remember Roc with the drop top
candy flip flop box had this trick bitch lips locked on my big cock
Mike and Joe I get hoes I be digging em out
We have threesomes both like dick and clit in they mouth
Rememer Randy that hang with Danny
got a sister named Brandy his old lady don't wear no panties
Remember Steve I played ball with
you done seen him with me his bitch like dick between her titties
and oh yeah
Your brother-in-law's bitch don't you know her
ain't that your sister I had to hit her
spent no cash to get her
now ain't I a nasty nigga
thank you were playing me, got the last get-ta, wha!

Tasha: Ooooooh, Smoke I hate you! (hate you hate you hate you hate you)

Chorus: (2x)
When you were cheating on me
I was cheating on you
We both was cheating on we
So what the fuck we gon do?
I don't know!

(Phone rings)
Anwsering Maching picks up:
Yeah this Tasha, I'm not home right now but leave your name and number and I might get back to you (beep)

I gotcha hiding 
you know you wrong girl
pick up the phone
stop playing
I know you there
you hear me I know you home
You ain't gotta be scared
I ain't crazy deranged
hell I been sneaking cheating and doing the same thang
my dog had been creeping fucking every bitch
in your trick clique 
to the one that put your weave in
She been licking me up
licking my dick and my butt
she swollow cum you don't
you stop and spit in a cup
Ya girl Pam the one that spent the night at ya house
I call her Gargamale
she gargle male balls in her mouth
and you mama now that's the real freak of the year
like to watch me jack my dick then skeet in her ear
and I know you know Brenda the with the baby
she keep swearing I'm the daddy she crazy
want me to kick it with her like I don't know she a slut
she gave me that doo-doo brown
I stuck my dick in her (anwsering machine beeps)

[Chorus 3x to fade]</pre>
