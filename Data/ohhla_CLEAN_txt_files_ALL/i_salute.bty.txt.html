[Black-Ty]
Black-Ty, it's time to show 'em the other side
You motherfuckers, ain't ready
 
Sticks and stones may, break my bones but
Words will never hurt, it won't work
So throw dirt on a nigga, and watch me brush my shoulders off
I ain't soft or lost, I'm C.E.O. the boss
Think about it, he done went from this and that and back
and ain't tryin to rap, man we ain't havin that
Says who, you? You ain't got a clue what I been through
Your {?} done saught on me dude
We used to be cool when I was on the R&amp;B side
Rap niggaz are singin, I figured I'd give it a try
Can't be mad, you niggaz never called me for a hook
The industry shook, I'm Black-Ty, open the books
Steady reppin the block, niggaz know I'm from Watts
I'm keepin it hot, the West Coast move won't stop
Straight out the do' for sho', got plenty collabo's
You niggaz ain't ready for the wrath; don't make me laugh
I been doin this rap shit for years
Blood, sweat and tears, no fears
So let me be clear, I got medicine for your ears
And nah Dre didn't do it; shit is still how I bounce to it
I salute {*echoes*}</pre>
