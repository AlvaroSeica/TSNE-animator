Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 4X: Truck w/ ad-libs]
What ya'll really came to do? (what they really wanna do?)
What ya'll really wanna do? (what they really came to do?)

[Truck]
First off, I wanna know what ya'll really came to do
Ready to get the shit popping, brought ya whole damn crew
Welcome to party mania, it's all on you
Watch ya step though, make sure you rep, bro
To get inside, people breaking they neck, yo
Just to hear hip hop, reggae, and techno
Meant for every nigga, there's about three chicks
Doing the dirty south bounce, off this Truck remix
Feel the beat thump, let's get this place crunk
Get loose, wild out, do what you want
Thought there's just a few questions that I like to ask
You got weed, blow it up, man, puff puff pass
Shorty in the mood, so much, almost spilt her glass
She smile, walked away, and I'm watching her ass
It's a beautiful world, a special place to go
If you got nothing to do, ain't got no 'dro
CSM, we can do it some more

[Chorus 4X]

[Truck]
The type of music, we can all get rowdy to
When you in the club, make you move ya body to
The way we do your thing, get down, and all inside of you
Had a long week, the weekend's finally here
Last day of work, can't wait to get up out of here
Cop a bag of crip, a cold six pack of beer
And hit the 1-95, that's what it is
Hungrymen for life, straight handling biz
And after that comes the pleasure, dreams of happiness
Anything's possible, you can't even measure
Dedication and teamwork, we did it together
I know they gonna hate now, so I tell 'em whatever, huh
Just name a time and place, beef, yeah, if that's the case
Bring an army, or just me and you, face to face
What you really want, tired of silly stunts
Fake pimp with your wee gold fronts, get ya money up

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
