(*talking*)
The hardest nigga out here, better quit fucking with me
(better quit fucking with me), I keep wrecking these c.d.'s
You better quit fucking with me, (better quit fucking with me nigga)
Killa nigga that's right, run it let's do this shit Rayface

[Kyleon]
You can catch me, Dickie suited and Chuck'ed up
I ain't rocking no pink, you got Kyleon fucked up
Badge on my chest, Killa looking like the cops
While you niggaz dressed in pink, looking like the bops
My chain ring and bracelet, looking like the watch
That mean, everything I sport's iced out
The realest rapper, from the twan to the head
You disagree, you finna see me put a gun to your head
Make a false move, and try to run then you dead
(so you better start smart), and start sleeping with the guns in your bed
Make a false move, and try to run then you dead
(so you better start smart), and start sleeping with the guns in your bed
Make a false move, and try to run then you dead
(so you better start smart), and start sleeping with the guns in your bed
And my killers don't talk, take a look at Rayface
They're 'noid, when he put this AK in they face
Or get the .45, from Dre Day in they face
Come up in your house, but not to parlay in they place
And, Kyleon is a hit flow spitter
My raps conceded, you can't fuck with this flow nigga
Just face it, you stuck with this flow nigga
Your lil' kids, need to look up to this flow nigga
If you had sense, you'd hook up with this flow nigga
But you scared, I shook up with this flow nigga
Keep look at Kyleon, still the dude to watch
Cause me and Slim the best combo, since shoes and socks
I guess that's the reason, why these dudes are hot
Cause I keep killing these flows, and these dudes are not

(*talking*)
That's a damn shame, you're not fucking with me man
Your slugs, are not fucking with me man (uh-uh man they not)
I'm too fucking consistent, you are not fucking with me man Killa

[PJ]
PJ bitch, bout to get right to it
Yella gon mix it, Rayface gon screw it
I'ma tell you this, and I'ma tell you one time
Get out of line, and lose your motherfucking mind
No I don't mean, going crazy
Talking bout, leaving your damn brain on the pavement
Ride with Kyleon, and we strapped up and heated
Show me a town, going down and I'll bleed it
Niggaz can't see me, my flow too sick
You don't like my shit, you could suck two dicks
Everywhere I go, people notice my face
A nine millimeter, what I tote on my waist
If you can't stand the heat, then move around
You ain't heard yet, them damn Boyz N Blue in town
It's going down from the winter, on into the summer
Trying to throw the Davin rims, on a candy blue Hummer
Hoes wanna fuck, so they give me they number
That broad that you chasing, I done already done her
Hoes wanna fuck, so they give me they number
That broad that you chasing, I done already done her
Hoes wanna fuck, so they give me they number
That broad that you chasing, I done already done her
Big laptops, when I crawl like a stunner
Bass so hard, truck sound like thunder
Coming down tight, smelling like cologne
Make a bitch seat dick, when I pull up on chrome
PJ hoe, I ain't playing with you boys
My click rolling thick, in them candy blue toys what

(*talking*)
Rap hustling motherfucker, PJ
Boss Hogg Outlawz, dream team you know I'm saying
You boys ain't fucking with it, wave your white flags

[Sir Daily]
It's Sir Daily back do'ing, PJ and Kyleon
Sliding on chrome, wrecking microphones
Dusk to dawn we get it, you name it we did it
Fuck showing love, we in it for digits
We gon break the microphone, everytime we spit
Gon pull up on chrome, everytime we spit
Iced out to the max, shining hard as the sun
Them Boss Hogg Outlawz, be the rawest to come
Out the Tex, and get checks to wreck
On the scene mugging mean, toting techs for plex
Wreck the deck, everytime the c.d. in
I got chrome on everything, you see me in ha

(*talking*)
Daily baby, feel that
All Flows 3 nigga (you know the veteran rookie
I'm in the sto's right now, check me out
Spit some game right quick)</pre>
