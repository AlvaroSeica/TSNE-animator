[Verse One]
Tired of this bullshit, so I'm on a downlow
creeping while you sleeping trick or treating with my Lights low
Skullcap, Gloves tight
Loading up the nine glocked
Stroll through the Springcreek looking for your chilling spot
You gon be a victim of a Tommy Wright Homicide
Dealee you can't sirvive, no way you could stay alive
FUCK YOU PUNK BITCH, listen to this last blast(gunshot)
Wrap you in a sheet cause I can't supply yo bodybag
??? and jay cause I went solo with my studio
use you for a couple of songs and never paid you sissy hoe
Step close, real quck

You know where to find me nigga in the middle of these Skreets

Weak tapes that you made

[Chorus]
Do you think they can take me, you gon need a whole army to fuckin take me

I ain't got no sense when these bullets hit my fuckin gun
dead on the seen

Stick my dick in Lynchin mouth
Let's see if Lynchin can talk some more
