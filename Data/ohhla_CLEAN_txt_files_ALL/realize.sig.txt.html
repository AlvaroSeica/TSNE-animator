[Beanie Sigel Talking]
Somebody's burnin close to the ground
I been here before,but I aint gone lay down
naw, naw you suckas, i aint gone lay down

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
Uh aiyoa I walks like a pimp, spark wit this mack
Click lock aint a smith you tell from this gat
You fuck around and lose a leg or somethin
I laser somethin I'm a predator
Make me Schwarzennegger something
You niggas talkin bout a dolla aint a thing
I got da blocks boilin move oils like Babylon
I move work in and out da Tri-State 
All doubles don't supply weight
All bureaus five eights
Yeah, I'm in and out of state
I touched alot of states
And yeah my plate touched alot steaks
And you crumbs can't supply a cake
And cake don't make crumbs it's true
Do da knowledge wait
I'm try to school you to some game youngin
But you nuckle head lame youngin
Swear you know the game youngin
Swear we move on the same train youngin
I'm on a different track
I'm the conductor yall niggas rats

[Rell: Chorus Sung]
Yall niggas don't realize [uh uh]
What it takes to make this doe
There's no mothafuckin way that I [we eatin nigga]
Can show you how we roll
Wish yall realized [get meal, get a free lunch ticket or somethin]
What it takes to make this cream
Things I'm makin wit my team
So simple as it seems

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Yall niggas fuckin wit that bake and that come back
And always got a story like wait, I'ma come back
Sometimes you gotta go away to make a come back
And those that know when they go don't even come back
My nails dirty I aint sit on my hands
Scale dirty i aint sit on no grams
Jail worthy got dat shit my ass
Man, hustlin all inside of me
I cop a spot, pop them numbers like the lottery
Keep my luck sevens, big fours right beside of me
Not pick six keep hollows right beside of me
In case them numbers on them balls jump around
I gotta make them boys come to town and dumb around
You mufackas betta buckle down
Before I buckle down
Naw nigga we can't knuckle now 
We past dat we on another level
Like blast dat, body bag, casket, nother shevel

[Rell: Chorus Sung]

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
I sold it all
I even broke them niggas on the dice
Bucked them niggas who was nice
Broke em all
You used to pop willies on the block
Now you pop willy on the block
So where da raw
My attitude like the state of Missouri
Can I relate to you story
Niggas naw
You talkin to the wrong one
Nigga I'm a strong gun
Walked in this game 
But I'm in it for the long run
Till the lord come
I'm a get it till it's all done

[Rell:Chorus Sung Until Instrumental and fade out]</pre>
