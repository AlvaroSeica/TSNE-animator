[Chorus]
We all wanna rise
We surely wanna fly
Y'all know we wanna try to live it up until we die
You know we gon' expire
But before it is ya time
You got a clue about what you gon' do with this part of ya life

[Verse One]
Father forgive me I'm a sinner
And I need you at the center of my heart
Cause that's where it all starts and I remember
When I entered your presence
You opened arms and loved me tender
Told me to observe your word so I could learn surrender
Without surrender it's the cold shoulder like it's winter
Cause your Son was stabbed, dragged, beaten, battered and injured
Before we were believers He was striped like a zebra
So we could rise like a fever
Instead of die in a heater
So for Him I get deeper
Cause life is grim like the reaper
The sin price will not get cheaper
And death he strikes like a cheetah
So you better believe a brother that tells you it's either
Light with the sinner seeker or night with them dimmer creatures
It's time

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Misses and Misters this Life will trick ya
It'll pretzel twist ya
Have you thinkin' that you are when you're not
I bring the Scriptures
What better way to get you focused in on the picture
Than to contrast and ask which life you think is the richer?
There's a dude who's about his paper
Some straight, some out of capers
Stay out his way cause he's tryin' to get back to Jamaica
When asked about his dirty dealings he called me "hater"
I said, "Look brother I hate the game, son I don't hate the playa"
He said, "I don't bother nobody, so me and god we just probably need to have a chat
How can he beef? I like to party"
Another example of one who's had ample shine
But only has samples of life in his mind It's time

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
There's another dude
This brother is never rude
His jokes are never shrewd
His comments never lewd
And this dude grinds on a 3 to 11 sometimes 7 days a week
And speaks of how it's gon' be up in heaven
He's not a goody two shoes
A bible based truth dude
Lives to be a light
Who do you think this dude is glued to?
No sex before marriage - no kiss, no baby, no carriage
No if, no maybe, won't happen
One day his lady gets carats
He understands the way relationship is supposed to happen
So I ask him, "Why not chase the silver, gold or platinum?"
Maybe back then but now it's new reaction
New walk, new talk, new mind and you'll find new time
