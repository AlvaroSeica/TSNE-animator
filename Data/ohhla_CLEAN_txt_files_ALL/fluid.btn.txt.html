	BOOM!

[Psycho Les]
I take a stick of dynamite and put it to my mouth
Light it up, then I blast off like Alf
I be off (off) into another world
Got no time to be strapped to a freaking girl
?Blood stones? I pop, let 'em fizz out on top
On my lizard tounge like a donk with the zert
I hung to the like break of dawn
Six-packs for the 'Nuts leave the baker

[Fashion]
I want to get wrapped in the sheets so I can sleep or sleepwalk
Mumble when I speak, but when I freak I speak talk
Get married to Juana, dip for my oink
Always on point to bumrush my joint
See the party can't last with the glass on the vineyard
So I put some yellow liquid and some dump on the menu
One two, to the like one two, my vision's hazy
Don't test me now, this paper's got me crazy

[Juju]
Ayo you be buggin' off the styles I be freaking
Dusted, keep you in a daze when I'm speaking
Stutter to be butter, but if you want I make it milky
A twenty bag of chocolate and a blunt, is you with me? (Yeah!)
Blowing smoke like a dragon, my mouth is dry and my eyes is sagging
So I flew, cause I felt I could do it
Do a dog, 40 ounce and fluid

	And fluid, and fluid
        Puff a cloud and drink the fluid
	Puff here, puff there
	World famous Beatnuts puff everywhere!

[Juju]
Stimulation, feel the junkie sensation
It keeps the funk in rotation
Sluggards you're moving slow
Take a hit and act like you know
Now I'm open for business, call a hon with the quickness
To get some physical fitness on
Gettin' that all night long
Intoxicated Demons in the house, I'm gone

[Fashion]
It's like a blast to my brain when I trip
Those lights and the sights at night make me flip
And then I want to slip to the magic kingdom
Some bitches in the stable, *lyrics played backwards* raid 'em
Cause I can make a movie with a sis or a buddy
And I'm a eat the cake no matter if it's chubby
Run up the line, double time, I'm ready
And I'm a get your gas chick like my name was Geddy

[Psycho Les]
Girl, want to pull a cloud?
Pass it around the crowd when the music's loud
Can't talk, you don't want to see me walk
Great minds as I fail in front of the park
I don't know what's going on
I feel upside down like a Pharcyde song
See keeps on buzzing me
When I'm through it, puffing and swimming in fluid

	And fluid, and fluid
        Puff a cloud and drink the fluid
	Puff here, puff there
	World famous Beatnuts puff everywhere!
