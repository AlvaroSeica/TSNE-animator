[ The E (&amp; DJ Boss ) ]
Hey yo Boss
(Yo, what's up?)
Yo man, we been waitin on this break for a long time
(Word, long time, gee)
But yo, why don't we take it on that other level
and this time we'll go nationwide
(Yo, but what about the doubters?)
Yo man, I know we got some doubters
but eh, why don't you rock some funky drums
and let me drop some cool lyrics and eh
we'll just get paid, knowmsayin?

( *DJ Boss cuts up* )
(I know how to)

[ CHORUS: The E ]
I know how to play em, yeah
I know how to catch em slippin
Huh
I know how to play em, yeah
I know how to catch em slippin

[ VERSE 1: The E ]
Why don't I just sit back, let em make a dumb track
Act like it's a hype track
Play scared and don't write back
Let him play big shot, thinkin that he's real hot
All the time I be schemin on a big plot
Baitin the man till the kid gets scent strong
He's gettin real souped, but yo, he's dead wrong
I ain't goin out like a sucker, no way, Jack
Time to get busy, this is my payback
First we'll get into this while I enter this
Content of smooth rhymes is built for this
Then I get wild, I get real wild
Profile like a child but I freestyle
Then I'ma activate while I captivate
MC's try to breeze, but yo, that'll take
Measures and measures of metaphors and beat breaks
But you come with a smile and a handshake
Singin that same 4/4 it-ain't-jack tune
Let's squash that and step to the backroom
It really doesn't matter who you are and where you come from
Long as you get the job done
Cause yo

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: The E ]
Then he'll be thinkin that he can walk by me
But I ain't down with that, don't even try me
I'm the Original E down with crew OG
And Boss is in here rockin the beat
Step on up to this, you'll be down to dig
You'll be dissed and dismissed like that other kid
Straight out the pack he's wack
I tried tellin him that
He tried frontin at E and Jack (what's up)
He don't want nothin, he frontin, laughin, gigglin
Jokin and gankin, still he wasn't thinkin
That's how I planned it all cool and subtle, right?
I didn't talk about it, I just did it, you like
Boss, so if you was in it from the get-go
You tuned in to a real pro
Cause yo

[ CHORUS ]

[ The E ]
Yo Boss, break it down
