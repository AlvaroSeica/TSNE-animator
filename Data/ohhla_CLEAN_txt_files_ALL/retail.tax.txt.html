Typed by: sensative_new_age_guy@hotmail.com

Saturday afternoon, (Retail!)
Two for one, (Retail!) Three for five

[Chorus]
We go Tesco, Virgin, Argos, Asda
Monday to Sunday and all days after
What you take me for, I'm like you
Down brain cross looking for a pair of shoes
Got caught up in, causual shopping
Get dragged in by the tele I'm watching
Get dragged in by the lights of the circus
That make me want shit accidently on purpose
We go Tesco, HMV then Asda
This guy down my street bought a brand new Mazda
I went down to lake side to buy some car accessories
Woman pulled out of the car park too quick, hit him!
Ohh what a mess it is, guess she was distracted by the effing kids
fighting in the back seat, (why?) All the toys they've got
What a stress it is, all for a day at the shops

[Chorus] {2X}
It goes (Retail!)
Everybody shop 'til you drop
There's so much stuff to buy
There's so much stuff to purchase and probably it's all worthless
Modern-day churching circus

[Verse 2]
My local shops went bust
Cos of high street chains, big names and such
Fifty years in the game, I grow sudduct
British cities all look the same - and that sucks
Got Dixons, Tesco, even Star Bucks
Golden Arches - but I don't eat that muck
What the harm is, do you really have to act?
Promoting broccoli to kids now a thankless task(??)
or where the farm is, sheep with a blue tongue mask
A sad reflection of their fate, check the suicide rate
In the country farmers can't live like before
Ain't free-trade great? Buy it all from abroad

[Chorus]
We go Iceland, Waitrose, Marks and Sparks
Colour in some mean?? numbers 'til they glow in the dark
I read small print and leave with zilch
Tryna do my weekly shopping, coming out with just milk
("oooo.. we all night shopping by baby!"...)
("oooo.. we all night shopping by baby!"...)

[Verse 3]
We go Primark, Jigsaw, Zara??, Topshop
Cheap shit by the crate shipped out of job lock??
Straight out the sweat shop
She wanna be like Posh - but you'll be lucky if it lasts three washes
I follwed so many girls around stores
Nowadays I just wait and find a seat by the door
It's boring boring... why you asking me?
I don't have an opinion - we've been here since three
How many more ten quid tops do ya need?
Is it down to the mags you read?
Is it down to the fact it's a weeeekend
And all week we work, get the wages then we - spend
My brain hurts, there's so much stuff
And no matter how much it's never enough
Let the planet heat up, don't think it won't
Matter of fact - you ain't gonna need that coat
Down at PC World, should I wait? 
Any appliance I buy next year, it will be slow and out of date
Just after the warranty my flippin iPod broke
Shopaholiks raise your hands and take note

[Chorus]
Retail! Everybody shop 'til you drop
There's too much stuff to buy
There's so much stuff to purchase and probably it's all worthless
Modern-day churching service
Retail! Everybody shop 'til you drop
There's too much stuff to buy
There's so much stuff to buy
There's so much stuff to buy 
There's so much stuff to buy!!!</pre>
