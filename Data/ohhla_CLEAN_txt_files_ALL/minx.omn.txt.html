blx crew will show you who them knock offs are
you get knocked off bars, you try to walk like me
omni been down for years, show me your id
on the road I be, so and so, so
low pro, roll by me
you say what the fuck
booyah, the name brand, stamp quality product
I step ahead so your next move already be thought of
I'm just too hard to follow, never comfortable
smoke the genie out the bottle, you should swallow the fact
attack the city like flash floods, where's the match up
twenty minute mix tapes, the big face stack
its omni
I'm in the chamber shooting out the gift of gab
I add a pinch of fat, a little dash of this and that and then some
compliment the rhythm, kick the dopest fucking lyrics ever heard of
or a beat session __________
collaboration ______, on the mix, how could this be
break neck intensity, sounds so convincing
listen, turn it up a digit, it's the shiznit
you feel me,
if it isn't omni then what is it?

I got the funk for your trunk, I got the shit that you need,
the funk for your trunk, I got the shit that you need
the funk for your trunk, I got the shit that you need
I got the funk for your trunk, I got the funk, the funk (x2)

I got it, I got it, I got it, you found it, eureka
laced up my sneaker, kicked a hole in your speaker
their rain and snow, ten below on the meter
part creole, cherokee, eight _________
guiness book, one of the greatest, world famous
alias after alias, the government named us
most wanted, most wanted
but the niggas not ready, mutha fuckers try to take it
but my crowns too heavy
on your mark, ready, set, yeah, here we go
funkdafied freddy straight banging through your stereo
give me a minute and ill be in your girls cherio
fundafied freddy, shit that's me
the funk for your crunk, I got the shit that you need
the funk for your trunk, I got the shit that you need
I got the funk, the funk
I held lectures, taught some of the best to break records
to the tape deckers bumpin' old shit that you've been blessed with
now________be tested
my whereabouts aren't to be questioned
and I suggest its 50/50, nothing less man, be selective
and where you put your foot down the streets congested
the trees infested from the root down, its time to reboot
I'm on to plan b, its time to recoup
I'm on the come up, I'm out from sundown to sun up, what

grab your lighter and your blunt, light it up tonight (x3)
grab your lighter, grab your lighter
I got the shit that you need
I got the shit that you need
I got the shit that you need,
I GOT THE FUNK FOR YOUR TRUNK, I GOT THE SHIT THAT YOU NEED</pre>
