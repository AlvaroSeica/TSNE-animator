[Intro] [Apathy]
Motherfuckers don't understand. Demigodz bitch. Doe Rakers bitch. 

[Chorus] [x4]

[Verse One] [Apathy]
As soon as they heard Apathy they tried to pull the batteries out the box
But rapidly drop when they reacted to shocks
They overloaded over-lord of the land, the mortal, the man
Who's sorta like a soldier with a sword in his hand
According to myth, a rapper that was born with a gift
The force of his spit could cause internal organs to shift
In the beginning non believers tried to force him to quit
Ignorin' his wit, now the suckers orbit his dick
Embracin' in clubs, fake smilin' faces and hugs
Fabricated love all because he's makin' a buzz
The snakes who hate, went outside waitin' with thugs
To beat you down until ya shit got traces of blood
Y'all are new jacks to rap soundin' spacey and bugged
I been spittin' since ya mother had to lace up your Lugs
Face it it's over you tryin' to move the base of a boulder
With weights on ya shoulders so stand back or wait till you're older
Lil' soldier
Trust me I got ways to control ya
I'm like God to the Devil 
Ap is Satan's Jehovah
I don't even write raps cause the paper would smolder
So the flows are never over till I say that they over

[Chorus] [x4]

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
They say a way to a man's heart is through his stomach
But I know a shortcut that's through the chest which ain't too far from it
Ain't fuckin' with cameras but I'm takin breast shots
My gat bangs while you playin Max Payne on X-Box
Watch the lead chop a couple strands out ya dreadlocks
And send you niggas J-walkin' like you rockin' S. Dots
Swing medieval swords with lethal force, behead ya soldiers
Not talkin' soap but these bullets will clean your Head &amp; Shoulders
Arms back and torso kneecaps they all go
When we open fire at your little sisters horse show
Celph Titled the Rubix Cuban is shootin' through ya roof with Rugers
Jumpin' out the sewer in a scuba suit
Fuck with the Godz and feel the agony of Hell's grip
My niggas throw grenades the size of Patti LaBelle's tits
Rap about artillery but never had no parts of missiles
Thought you had a gun but all you had was just a starter pistol

[Chorus] [x4]
Represent Represent

[Verse Three] [Motive]
Yo hatin' me is only makin' me more hungry and anxiously
To get mine and sit by more cake than bakeries
The Godz clique make hits but different from all of these artists
Y'all sellin' more fake shit than a damn flea market
I see part to most this industry is weak hearted
Y'all see beef I'm servin niggas like a meat market
So keep barkin' cause real dogs we bite first
Y'all can talk on the mics but in life my knife works
I'm ready for the game is it ready for me?
I done stepped beyond any level you define an MC
See, cats a joke actin' like they hustle for cream
Knowin only Coke you push is on a vending machine
Well known and respected Motive hope you never forget it
Heads I embed it with a flow that's energetic
Fuck a vote I been elected
As a new mic weapon with a ill thrill style that's been perfected
Disrespect ya life can end in an instant
These MCs are like dykes act like men but really are bitches

[Chorus] [x4]
Represent y'all, Represent</pre>
