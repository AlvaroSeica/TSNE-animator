{Sound of a helicopter} 

[Officer 1] 
Juvenile 
You are not a soldier 
Put down your soldier rag and ground the chopper 
If you don't we will... 
I repeat...If ya 
Just blast that mutha fuck 
{gun shots} 
{broken glass} 

Verse 1: 
I'm bout that paper 
I'm on top and it (?) 
You wanted beef 
Bitch you didn't heard I was in it 
You're out dare stuntin 
Ya run the north at da mouth 
Jumpin off buildins, that you don't know nothin about 
(Yeah) Shit it's serious 
You hear these lyrics that I'm spittin 
You see me comin 
I bout that K, best be gettin 
Fire spittin 
Guts and brains I be hittin 
(?) for (?) 
Look no retire, no quittin 
It's payback time 
Boy you done put it on my mind 
? show, Look! You won't be hard to find 
I gotta do ya 
Even though way-back I knew ya 
I gottcha on scope and see right thru ya 

Chorus:1x 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
(Put down that soldier rag, put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
You used to roll wit Jimmy, do that make ya a fag 

Verse 2: 
Now whats happenin wit you 
You dissin me boy too 
Ya tired of livin, ya want ya life to be thru 
Ya gettin played by ya company, do they have ya out dare 
You think Big Boy got hags, bitch you think you really care 
You got beef wit one of us, they be do'n ya everythang 
Do ya feel like a queen, when ya listenin to the king 
Is that really style rap, when ya rap do ya brag 
You used to roll wit Jimmy, do that make ya a fag 
Ya hatin 40-T, they be lovin T-Bone's tracks 
And it's cold how I rap 
Knockin Juvey off da map 
Still gon' wreck the Lexus Monday, tote the Legend Tuesday 
Flood the Benz Wednesday, fuck da K, fuck da uzi 
When you done hooked up wit Baby, ya led him to his thang 
Do the prior call ya Juvey, Jimmy called you Miss Stank 
Ya got the projects back 
While Cash Money maggin 
And get ya style rap 
I'm jackin 
Got Big Boy mad 

Chorus:1x 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
(Put down that soldier rag, put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
You used to roll wit Jimmy, do that make ya a fag 

Verse 3: 
Can ya handle ya business, can ya open up ya own 
When ya here come a missle, when ya leave and live alone 
Are you listenin to the words a real soulja speak 
Do you get paid for the concerts you do every week 
Does ya manager get half and you ten percent 
Did Baby take his money back for the soulja he (?) 
Is that really a Hummer 
You used to be a bummer 
That's somethin held ya down when ya tryin to make ya come up 
Boy had to have a ride (ride) 
Drove a number jive (jive) 
Never were good but that's when you be shy (shy) 
Do you drive ya own car, do Baby pick ya up 
And when Baby don't come get cha, do you be mad as fuck 

Chorus:1x 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
(Put down that soldier rag, put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Don't be no fag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
Stop dressin drag boy (Put down that soldier rag) 
(You ain't no soldier boy put down that soldier rag)
