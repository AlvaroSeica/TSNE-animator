[Hell Razah]
She swallow two Extra, two Beck's, show me her new breasts
Baby girl, model and shit, pushing that new Lex'
Strip in the back of the club, watch what we do next
Sex in positions and moves, that she ain't do yet
Kicked off Manolo heels, up in the duplex
Told me when I talk in her ear, it get her too wet
Weed in her doobie and burnt, groupie alert
But woman is the beauty of earth, like fruity desert
Who wanna hear they name in a verse, they swallow and burp
Go home and tell they man how they feelings is hurt

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Everytime I step in the club, they screaming Rabbi
Chicks falling in love soon as I pass bye

[Hell Razah]
We get in whips like a spaceship, and love AK clips
And throw E's at them Playboy chicks
You can't blow when you hate on men, sit back, wait on men
With fork tongues, snaking they friend
In my hood, it's against all odds, who got sixteen bars
Fast money for them luxury cars
I was formed in the image of God, I ain't material
Still stay strapped with the scratched off serial
The black Sinatra, with a pocket full of miracles
Yea I got ears and I'm still not hearing you
Back with the hood on smash, I rock an old gold Maccabee badge
And a dead president mask
So when I spit, my nigga, that's tear gas
Go tell ya record label, kiss my ass
I'm a BK soldier, ratchet out the hoster
Live with the poor, sell weed, cracking cokah
Never mix Hennessey with no soda
Shorty wanna two-way, page the Motorola
Show you how to bag a mature and much older
Independent woman and shit, just like Oprah
You floss with a Crystal bottle, I sip Coronas
And still gotta fish out models that wanna bone us
Your style be a tax write off, I be an owner
I be your owner, yeah, I said

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Everytime I step in the club, they screaming Rabbi
Chicks falling in love soon as I pass bye
I ain't caught up in hairdos and brown eyes
I make love to ya mom, baby, it's Rabbi
I make love to ya mom, baby, it's Rabbi
I make love to ya mom, baby, it's Rabbi
It's Rabbi, it's Rabbi

[Hell Razah]
I keep it ghetto where it's grimey, grimey, you know Bedstuy be
Throwing them block parties, dealing with God Bodies
Before John Gotti, before La Di Da Di
Before Biggie Smalls, BK been lively
My project army, Red Hook been behind me
I spit jewels shiney, bright as Illuminati
The White Owls, see the white inside Colin Powell
Hitler and George Bush, that's why you acting Nazi
I be a child of Israel, it's young Haile Selassie
Ghetto Government, Ark of the Covenant
Dark skin is loving it, she wanna call me Rabbi, the way I thug with it

[Chorus]</pre>
