Song:   So What You Sayin
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Jay electrolysis probin the globe like a geologist
Puttin all of you pussies on display like gynocologists
Listen, I'm on a mission
Most of you niggas just spittin
The wise comprehend-iction hypnotize with the rhythm
Lyrical circumsicion toss the shmuck in the fire
Yea your mans and them is nice but they ain't fuckin with sire
I'm a higher power devour all you idolaters
You satan worshipers nation perverters thirstin for dollars
Jay coldplay putting the clock on your chess game
I'm a varsity letterman you a fresh-mayne
Every line of every verse of every song is a quotable
Catch me in mexico meditating with quetzalcotl fuckers
I'm rainin fire on you lame suckers
My tongue is the burner the barrel the biscuit don't make me buck it spratt
I'm outta that mac I came into rap carrying the south on my back
And I'm ready to scriddap
I ain't where you from son it's where you live at
I never kiss another niggas bum to get me did-dap
I used to sip the coke and rum blowin dime sid-dacks
But now I'm wagin war with wicked men in high places
So what you sayin

Every page of my poetrys like a rhyme from the clip
The mic is always in my holster right on top of my hip
Niggas get flipped
When the hollowtip spit at they melons
You niggas is missy misdemenor my niggas is felons holla
My and big dame lord of the rings the twins towers
Knockin other motherfuckers out the ring like apollo creed
You wanna get bleed the blood run up
And get done up until sunup
Down south they call me white man cause I hang mcs
Get em open with ease
Then pick em off like fleas nigga please
You ain't go no ends in my casa
Que pasa
My flowll fuckin swole ya bumba rasta
Loch ness monster
It's like RAAAAAA when I strike ya
Suplexin niggas like rowdy rod piper
John allen muhammad snipe ya
It's a cost to be the boss and I paid the price-ah
Nobodies nicer
I'm cold as the north pole nobodies icer
Shout outs to mr porter, d-twizzy, and obie tricer
Shady, you can catch me in the D now baby it's all gravy
Still reppin UPT what is you sayin

I'm trapped in the game like pacmayne chasin the ghost
Drownin with water in my throat got leaks in the boat
Squeezin the toast
It's not a op-tion I got pac on
Makaveli the don bumpin at me
And my glocks on, zone in
Like robert dinero I'm ronin
Struck em up with the omen
From adolescence to grown men
Walk a mile in my shoes it proves you a soldier
I paid a lot of dues to prove to jehovah
That I can carry the cross the castle the crown
Everywhere I roam is my home lifes my battleground
Sallhuddin abdul farrad muhammad
To come up at by night ridin elijah the comet (uh)
I caved chest in the brave chessman
Masterin one twenty lessons is my profession
So get to steppin
Or catch led like zepplin
These rap cats look real but they really not like wrestlin
Check the solar commander
I'm light years off of the scanner
Satillite dishes and cameras a bad mama jama
The most thorough examiner
My microphone is seven thousand ninehundred and twenty six miles in diameter
The son of man
Son of t man from out puran
Master the air in the land from here to iran
Jay electronica revolve the world
Them philly cats say I like that boy he raw but he thorough
What you sayin</pre>
