Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'll always love the fact that we dare to be different
Our gifting is evident, relevant - we got that
Matter of fact, yeah let me write that
Take a break so I can write it, jot down - I'll be right back
I'll always love the fact that we dare to be different
Our gifting is evident, relevant - we got that
Matter of fact, you led me right there
Take a break so I can write it, jot down - I'll be right back

Now come along with me, a guest on a magic carpet ride
Don't be moving slow, keep up
We taking giant strides, and taking steps towards the depths to overcome our pride
Living life to the fullest, yeah, we die inside
I be together, truer guy, hear the burden
Hurting for certain, endure the pain
Can't let the truth die, dead as that
Rip the shirt off my back, let the whips crack, (see it coming)
Come the season that the serious is back
Flavour of love, Teron's ambulances favourite thug
Influences whose behaviour is bug
Said it just to be just, I speak freely
Can't get with it? - Unworthy to be in my presence, so please leave me
God made my gift and our cohesion write rhymes
Break bread, break the folks fair make life breezy
Pleas don't pick the skeazy, not any point of you
Praises - I've a-coined a few
You boy called Peazy

(said I'll be right back)
(said I'll be right back)

I'll always love the fact that we dare to be different
Our gifting is evident, relevant - we got that
Matter of fact, you led me right there
Take a break so I can write it, jot down - I'll be right back

Yo, see, just let me get through the door
Spread a few flows, touch a few souls
Too much has been sown to ever leave you out, alone in the cold
But, baby, I'm on a mission, got to do what I'm told
I remember making the promise at the end of my rope
In the county, facing them cases, at the end of my hope
Back to back, burning square, seeing visions of smoke
To myself, I kept it cool - the only way I could cope
Surrounded by dope dealers, killers, bases and more
Real talk - some real villains you ain't wanna provoke
So I kept a Bible close, seeking God on the low
Praying, asking for his forgiveness before I stop in their coat
Now the grace in which was shown and the mercy received
There's a difference between them other rappers, artists, and me
The hardest in me is chained to the pain of the steel
Got to reach them, so you got to let me go...but I be back though

(said I'll be right back)
(said I'll be right back)

I'll always love the fact that we dare to be different
Our gifting is evident, relevant - we got that
Matter of fact, you led me right there
Take a break so I can write it, jot down - I'll be right back

(said I'll be right back)
(said I'll be right back)

I'll be right back

(said I'll be right back)
(said I'll be right back)

I'll always love the fact that we dare to be different
Our gifting is evident, relevant - we got that
Matter of fact, you led me right there
Take a break so I can write it, jot down - I'll be right back</pre>
