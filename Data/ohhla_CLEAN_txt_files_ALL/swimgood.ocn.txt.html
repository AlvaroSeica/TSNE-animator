[Frank Ocean]
That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts, and put 'em in it
Now I'm drivin 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
And I don't see them - and I've got this black suit on
Roamin around like I'm ready for a fune-ral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

[Chorus]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin, bigger than me
Kick off my shoes, and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit, and swim good, and swim good, good

[Frank Ocean]
Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD yeah
Memory seats I'm sittin on stay heated
I woulda put tints on my windows, but what's the difference?
If I feel like a +Ghost+ no Swayze
Ever since I lost my baby
I've had this black suit on
Roamin around like I'm ready for a fune-ral
One more mile 'til the road runs out

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
I'm goin off, don't try stoppin me
I'm goin off, don't try saving me
No flares
No vest
And no fear
Waves are washin me
Out

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Don't die {*repeat and scat to fade*}</pre>
