Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah... Yeah
I never kept a diary
So when I die
What's inside of me
Is on them MP3s
Well it'll probably be
The closest thing to it
Put it all in my music
The good, bad, ugly
Lord use it
I just want You to be glorified through it
Hope they don't confuse it
Being a rapper's cool
But talking about the truth do nothing til you pursue it
Want to know the fast track to look stupid?
Talk about obedience and never go do it
Lord I'm a hypocrite and I'm sick of it
I need Your spirit to come help me live different
Got a certificate, graduated college
Learned a lot of stuff, that don't mean I got knowledge
Naw, 'less the fear of You end me
I'm so fallen but You the parachute with me

I hear Your voice
But not always listening
I don't wanna live this way, Lord

I hear Your voice
But not always listening
I don't wanna live this way, no more

Yeah, Lord
It's easy to be Mister read-a-lot
Instead of just being Mister be-a-lot
Why do we define ourselves by what we are not?
Instead of who we are
We tell them where we stop
Putting on new
Takin' off old
If you only take off, you'll be waking up cold
I just wanna live bold
Do what the text shows
Even if it means His will over my goals
Can't respond slow
Gotta be immediate
There's places on the globe
Where people are so needy it's appalling
Could've put off orphans in mattresses
If I never put my feet in them maxes
Dang
This is all access
I need help
Ain't too prideful to ask it
I ain't no Brett Favre
I need to practice
This track is still wack if I go backwards

I hear Your voice
But not always listening
I don't wanna live this way, Lord
I hear Your voice
But not always listening
I don't wanna live this way, no more

Oh, ohhhhhh
Oh ohhh, oh oh oh oh ohhhohhhh

I'm supposed to continue, right? Hehe

Ha haaa oh, ohhh
Oh oh oh oh ohhhohhhh
Oh, ohhhhhh
Oh ohhh, oh oh oh oh ohhhohhhh

I don't wanna live this way, Lord
I hear Your voice
But not always listening
I don't wanna live this way, Lord

I hear Your voice
But not always listening
I don't wanna live this way, no more</pre>
