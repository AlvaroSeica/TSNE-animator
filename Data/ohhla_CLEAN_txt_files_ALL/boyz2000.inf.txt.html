[Intro]
THE MASS THE MASS THE INFINITE MASS

If you hear any noise, it's just me and mah boyz
If you hear any noise, it's just me and mah boyz
If you hear any noise, it's just me and mah boyz
If you hear any noise, it's just me and mah boyz
Funkin' it up

Hey yeah... and me and my boyz gettin' funky only
Infinite Mass runnin' down the street
Me and Mah Boyz, Come on.

[Rodde a.k.a. Rigorod]
Right from beach back into the hood
Infinite mass got the bottle
Closer than a groupie and I
Look for BD BD BD dove high
I'm sending you a bud of the money to the chevy
And from the old to the heavywight school
Fresh round fool {The Mass}
The choice of the G-funk generation that is {whaaat}
A group of domination so fifth year I never neglect
The boyz who branch here triple X
The plot thickens, a bunch of set of homiez
[Takin' over - keepin' it right ah]

[Chorus]
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz

[Cham a.k.a. Chamdin]
Quick, break 'em off with a freaky tale
about a clique who's deep as hell
Chamdin, alwayz been
True to the M-A-double S
The group you don't test
We come like G's we dress like G's
We cool like G's we get all the Ladies
While I nod my head to the gangsta groove
Real smooth {yep}
We're now into groove {so}
Honeyz step to me, I never step to 'em
Tell'em it's my homiez, we share all ins
See us in the joint, get the point it's me and Mah Boyz
Playin' with hoes!

[Chorus]
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz
If You Hear Any Noise, It's Just Me And Mah Boyz

[Break]
