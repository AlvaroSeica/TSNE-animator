Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide, nigga I'm too damn fly
Sippin' all of this purple, it got me too damn high
They say there down for the team but playin' two damn sides
I'm like Niggaz ain't loyal, niggaz ain't loyal
And these voices in my head saying niggaz ain't for you
And when you gettin' money these niggaz will aim for you
And when its looking sunny these niggaz will rain on you
It's a dark cloud over me, money too controling me
I'm barely getting time to see my son and then she heard of me
Baby momma trippin out, I tell her to work with me
I'm on probabtion still strapped cause niggaz want to murder me
And lately I've been getting faded
Cut a couple homies off cause them niggaz hating
And all these bitches wanna fuck me cause a nigga made it
I'm getting paper heart cold as the refrigerator

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga go and get it yeah
And ain't a damn thing change but the bezel on my Rollie
And the diamonds in my chain, yeah

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Young rich nigga quarter, millie worth of jewels
Bad bitch with me trying blow me like a fuse
Just to get a bag or maybe a pair of shoes
Ain't it crazy what your lady would do for a pair of Loubs
Big dreams turn to big thangs
I've been waiting on this day since I was 16
Big chains, Aston Martin as I switch lanes
Before I ever made a hit, I had a wrist game
In the kitchen with them thangs, trying make a killing
We in the building, every other month I make a million
Any nigga talking reckless cause they think I'm chilling
Till I put some money on thier head, yeah, make them feel it
Have they own homies do him like they never knew him
I'll have Armelle walk up on him when we run into him
Close range shorty have him put something through him
So I hope your ready cause we heavy and we're coming for you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
The meek shall inherit the earth
So I'ma own this bitch until I'm buried in dirt
I only roll with niggaz that'll carry me to my hearse
Blesses for my grandma, she carried me to that church
And I don't know why, I just feel like I'm the one
They label me a victim but now look what I become
Or should I say became, I don't do it for the fame
I'm for what they never make it but I went against the grain
Charges riding against my name, assasination to my character
Life's a bitch, she cheated on me but I married her
Niggaz getting murdered, this shit is getting scarier
Dodging all the pot holes, jumping all the barriers
And if she a bitch, I feel like I just got in that pussy
Shorty wanna be a star, that's why she popping that pussy
She trying to win so she hang amongst winners
That's why I take the time just to pray at mom's dinner
Cause I remember, cold nights not the winter
Not the weather I'm talkin' about
Cause for that money, sins they get committed
And friends they get to splittin', divided just like division
So e'rrday that I wake up, my undivided attention
It goes to getting my cake up and staying out of them prisons
The system made me stronger
And being broke just gave me my hunger
I'm gone!

[Outro]
Nigga like me I walk around, fear no man
I don't owe you niggaz shit!
E'rry nigga you see around me
That's the niggaz that's with me, unless they in jail or dead or something
Nigga livin' life like fuck all you niggaz
Ya feel me?!</pre>
