[Chorus]
"And I'm schemin' to get what I like"
And I need it, cause I want it
When I see it, and I'm
"And I'm schemin' to get what I like"
What I don't got's what I will get
cause I won't stop

[Dawaun Parker]
Yeah, I'm riding through the city with the suicide doors out now
Trust me, I'm killing myself
And I'm not a +Doctor+, but I am an intern
So they say I must be ahead of myself now
Maybe I should slow down, get out the fast lane
Put it on cruise control, sitting in my airplane
You can say I'm fly but let me do the damn thang
Play this in the club like we was on the fairway
I keep the +9 iron+, schemin' I'm trying
Dreaming they was like, he was not lying
Nah, since a young boy running from the cop cars
on the block, ducking when the shots firing
And shorty feel the vibe
She wanna roll with the boy, she down to ride (let's ride)
Yeah, and show me something I ain't never seen
I'll put a diamond on it, make it up for everything

[Chorus]

[Dawaun Parker]
I'm sick, I spit, it flow like water
It drip-drip-drip-drip, you get wet
Back when I touch down, got two on deck
If I don't now,schi give me like two more secs
I take time in this game to rise in this game
When you came from nothing to having what I've obtained
And everybody acting brand new with interviews
and friends all praying that I won't change
But I won't change, I just got more change
since I came from the bottom to the top of thangs
Where they shot-call in droptop cars and all
I'm built for this lifestyle, I was born to ball
D. Parker the soloist, I'm so schizo
"Big Bang", I'm so Flipmode
Watch the M5 ride through the strip slow
I'm in the G6 looking out the window, schemin'

[Chorus]

[Dawaun Parker - over chorus]
Yeah, you gon' have to pardon me on this one man
I'm just flying high y'know? Yeah
Uh, D. Par', uh
Let it ride on..
