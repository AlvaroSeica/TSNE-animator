[Chorus  1X]
Pimpin' ain't easy
Pimpin' ain't easy
Hustin' ain't easy
Believe me
Working ain't easy
That's why we got that Tai Chi

[Bigga Nolte]
More cannabis, more ganja
More hi-grade, more purple haze, more Mary Jane
More trees, more gyal, more please
I need my tai chi, so
I roll it, I smoke it, I toke it
Make me feel good, no jokin'
I know, I flow, like whoa
Make the girl dem go out of control, yeah
Dem love me, gyal dem need we
Got di tai-chi dat's why di gyals swam we
Dem love it when they see me in the stance
Come on the floor and bus out the dance, yeah

With the big man, dat's who dem wan go with

Baby gyal gimme what's mine, yeah

[Chorus  1X]
Pimpin' ain't easy
Pimpin' ain't easy
Hustin' ain't easy
Believe me

That's why we got that Tai Chi

[Oozeela]
Everyday I been working, working
For the finest things I am searching, searching
Now my body is hurting, hurting
Hope when I get home I'll be smoking, smoking
Me nuh like transcendental mediation
Yoga too stiff, cocaine too strong
Burn a big spliff, elevate from grade one
Praise the almighty, bun out Satan
Dominican, Southside Edmonton
Dat-Ci Productions, Oozeela and Big man
M.O.B Crew, Roseau St. John
Smoke another one, cause

[Chorus  1X]
Pimpin' ain't easy
Pimpin' ain't easy
Hustin' ain't easy
Believe me
Working ain't easy
That's why we got that Tai Chi

[Bigga Nolte]
Oohh wee, you know the weed is on
We smoke it yo, the girls love the cheech-a-chong
Dem love it yo, di gyals say we turn them on
We chop that, roll that, then we burn it yo
We earn it yo, yes we hafee make the doe
We take yuh hoe, they love how the way we flow
We bust the show, they like how the big man roll
And like a big star, just watch me glow, ay-yo

[Oozeela]
Conflict want a drag, Pascal want a drag
Shadi want a drag, straight from the marijuana bag 
Poli have a bag, di Union have a bag
Smoke annuda one for the snake charm'a the dramatist
Dominican and all Jamaican man, Trinidadians
Let them know it's Music For Mavericks 
Bigga Nolte, double O-Z
Dat-Ci feeling Irie from the Tai Chi

[Chorus  1X]
Pimpin' ain't easy
Pimpin' ain't easy
Hustin' ain't easy
Believe me
Working ain't easy
That's why we got that Tai Chi</pre>
