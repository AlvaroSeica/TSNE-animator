[Intro]
I don't want nobody {3X}
Nobody but you baby
I don't want nobody {2X}
I don't want nobody, but you
 
[will.i.am]
It's all so clear (clear), clear to me now
It gotta be your class, style and your smile (smile)
The sun ain't shinin (nope), shinin when you're gone (nope)
All I get is rains (rains), all I get is storms (storms)
Cause there's nothin I can do (do), and nothin I can say (say)
Cause I know I coulda woulda shoulda ask you to stay (stay)
Stay with me for life (life), make you my wife
But my ego had me blindin and I couldn't see the light (blind blind)
Love is complicated ('cated), only when you fight it (fight it)
Love is at its greatest when you touch it like Midas
And it's that simple, simple as can be
I'm the only one for you, you the only one for me (me)
Now you see it takes two (two), two times a charm (charm)
And this time around we gon' form a strong bond (bond bond)
And together we could soar (soar), soar to wherever
And I'll never leave you never cause forever is forever
 
[Interlude]
Pretty girls they be comin around
I wanna let you know I be turnin 'em down
Cause I don't want no other ladies tellin me they love me
Pretty girls they be comin around
I wanna let you know I be turnin 'em down
Cause I don't want no other ladies tellin me they love me
 
[Chorus]
Ey, ey, ey. ey - I don't want nobody
I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody 
Nobody but you baby, I don't want nobody 
I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody, but you
Bae, you a fly girl (fly girl), a fly girl (fly girl)
Fly girl (fly girl), I want you to be
my girl (my girl), my girl (my girl)
My girl (my girl), ooh yeah baby you a
fly girl (fly girl), fly girl (fly girl)
Fly girl {fly girl}, I want you to be
my girl (my girl), my girl 
A girl-girl, a girl-girl
 
[will.i.am]
I be reminiscin ('niscin), thinkin 'bout the moments (moments) 
Spend alone for hours while we sittin, talkin, holdin (holdin)
Connected conversations ('sations), affectin our relation ('ation)
Our chemistry will bubble up that tinglin sensation (ting)
You tease and blow me kisses, I play and call you Mrs. (wrs.)
I missed the way you hug me when you whisperin your wishes
I never meant to hurt you (hurt you), I hope you know I'm sorry (sorry)
Together we could bring a happy ending to the story (story story)
All we need is trust (trust), and just another chance
A little bit of luck in romance to advance
I'll be your knight in shining (shining), you'll be my silver lining (lining)
A good relationship is precious like a diamond
...And I never let you go (go)
And I wanna let you know (know), that I'm open up to grow (grow)
And together we could float (float), float to wherever
And I'll never leave you never cause forever is forever
