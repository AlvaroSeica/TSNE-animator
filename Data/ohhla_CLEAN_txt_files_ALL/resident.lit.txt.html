A tisk, a tasket, no, I ain't from England
switch the tactics, what I take from thinking
signals flashing though you say it's blinking
quick to pass you 'cause I think you're drinking...

Hardy-har, got many bars from Mars
and a saucer parked under my neighbor's yard.
I though garages were a place for parties
and not to park a candy-painted car
we 'shawty, shawty!' like we eight feet tall
as we follow bodies in a mating call
I say, why do colored people act this way?
Putting out more butts than an ashing tray
am I asking of way too much information?
Someone please state 'fore I end this statement
can't nobody tell me if I'm wrong or right?
Everybody say that they're the grown-up, right?
I'm about to make them rude awaken
the whites'll stop to tell me, 'dude you're baking!'
Can't somebody tell me if I'm wrong or right?
Wearing short and sandles when it's cold out...

Why do people act like that?
Are they on that crack in a habitat
that is so laid back you'd have a heart attack
from a paper bag busting, people looking funny at me
Well, go ahead and think-a think-a think think I'm crazy [x4]

I dread to tell you that the next hit show
gon' be live forever just to let you know
got front row seats plus season passes
sunny in the evening when the missiles blast, it's funny
'cause this here they never teach in class
go dummy on a teacher just to see who laughs
don't hurry 'cause this moment couldn't be your last
no bombing from a country with an evil past
so, round and round a-ricke-round
we go as global warming's shutting down our globe
sounds like a problem for the Brown-Eyed Bandit
down from the constellations, now, I've landed
I can try to make a rude awaken
I'm the prophet with the new school flavor
can't somebody tell me if I'm wrong or right?
Thinking I can save the world before I...

Why do people act like that?
Are they on that crack in a habitat
that is so laid back you'd have a heart attack
from a paper bag busting, people looking funny at me
Well, go ahead and think-a think-a think think I'm crazy [x4]

Plain as pizza but you people don't seem to frame the picture
so, I figure I'd lead you narrow
to the straight road with arrows to the brain
don't tell me you ain't fake, if you ain't
then you wouldn't have to follow
what the world say and tell you how to think
with the Bible and your parents here to tell you how to think
got babies with the glock four and ladies with the lockjaw
Ding! I got a lightbulb
I feel it through the mic-phone, 'gon' switch it on,'
my conscience keeps going, no one even knows the consequence
though they know how to keep themselves a condom package
but you got a baby that was born from practice
I'm just trying to make a rude awaken
time is priceless and it's soon too late
so, can't somebody tell me if I'm wrong or right
living like the devil but I love God...

Why do people act like that?
Are they on that crack in a habitat
that is so laid back you'd have a heart attack
from a paper bag busting, people looking funny at me
Well, go ahead and think-a think-a think think I'm crazy [x4]</pre>
