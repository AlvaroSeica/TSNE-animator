Uhh, Food &amp; Liquor
Yeah, my man said he wanted somethin real..
real.. real.. real.. real
Somethin he could recognize, somethin he could feel..
feel.. feel.. feel.. feel
Baby girl said she was in the mood for somethin real..
real.. real.. real.. real
Somethin that could make her move
Somethin she could feel.. feel.. feel.. feel

Lusssst... sometimes can override trusssst
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he tou-chhhhed
He crushed everything he crushed
Ruined everything he loved, he just wanted to rushhhhh
Blamed it on the times bein rough
Doin dirt, with the devil, chasin after the dusssst
Make a fussss, if it's them, but we hushhh, if it's us

That's why, my momma said she wanted somethin REAL..
real.. real.. real.. real
Somethin she could be proud of, somethin she could FEEL..
feel.. feel.. feel.. feel
She said they so used to not havin nuttin real..
real.. real.. real.. real
That they don't know how to act
They don't know how to feel.. feel.. feel.. feel

Lifffffe... ain't meant to come around twiiiice
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest now I gotta give it LIFE
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night
I mean, I had a dream that, God gave me FLIGHT
Too fly for my own good so, God gave me plight
If I wake up in the mornin now I gotta give 'em SIGHT
Make 'em see, break 'em free, ain't a G, sho' you right

The game is not to give 'em nuttin REAL..
real.. real.. real.. real
Nothin they could use, nuttin that they could FEEL..
feel.. feel.. feel.. feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's REAL..
real.. real.. real.. real
So that's all that they a-know
That's all that they a-feel.. feel.. feel.. feel

Struggle... yeah yeah, another sign that God love you
Cause on the low, bein po', make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes to try and keep them out of trouble
Cause bein po', also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own, I can hit them with a couple
Couple, my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can, on the man, up above you

That's why, I gotta give 'em somethin REAL..
real.. real.. real.. real
Somethin they could recognize, somethin they could FEEL..
feel.. feel.. feel.. feel
To my homies on the block I gotta give 'em somethin real..
real.. real.. real.. real
Somethin that'll make 'em stop
Somethin they can feel.. feel.. feel.. feel

Yo! For real, really real, yeah!
Know what it is, woo!
Baby girl said she was in the mood for somethin REAL..
real.. real.. real.. real
Let's go!
