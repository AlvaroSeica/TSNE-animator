[Verse 1]
We dance like Indians
The ritual will split a crew, bring em in
All this for you
Twist it through, let em live
With the pain of a million men then tell me what it is
Sunshine or rain
Never beg a friend
Liberated, niggas hate it, that's my medicine
Fuck friendly
Benz jeeps with the leather trim.
I'm ten deep, stack chips, king we moving in
Jalopy's cock-d, pristine with the tint
All across boards, all aboard, y'all split a gem
Leave you cock-eyed, lop side, boy feel the wind
(Wind wind wind wind)
Push your balls in your stomach
Forfeit and run it
Last days, blast tre's, ya'll niggas done it
Speak no, see no, hear no evil
Lethal like vehicles
With a dent in em, feminine, ladies and gentlemen
Crazy, cry like babies when I'm hemming' em
Vocally, broke em up like Jodeci.
Fine cuts like kosher meat, dead em like coastal beef
Forget about it!
I spit my verses grinning' while the earth is spinning' with perverted women
Purr like kittens, turn over easy like germen engines
Paint face god
Eight bars shine like quasars
Sick like gay stars
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Craft this for bastards that fuck with us
Declare ruckus, we spear chuckas' with blow guns
Mighty like Joe young
White beef get so dumb
Explosion from Brooklyn to Leningrad
Holding a pen and pad
Rocking a five-deadly-venom mask
Hazardous
Carry this rhyme to your tombstone
Imagine this
Damage shit
Wild like group home
Got war paint from cheekbones to earlobes
Make a crowd of fools shut it down and move, there it go
If the flesh is weak than rest in peace, die slow
Lord
Last one standing king of survival
King of survival
King of survival

[Chorus]
