Oh

Uh ha, yeah
Uh ha, oh
My name is Bow Wow check me out now

(R.O.C.)
Uh-ohh, you then crossed the line
Beware of the dog is right there on the sign
You gotta muscle now, get em up and um
Put em up don't drop em
To the ceiling let, me see you get crunk bounce
Ugh, it will never be another one
Wit his style he' pound oh bow wow
From the eighteenth letter 
And this Playboy representin it forever
Can't no body do it better?
Never, when-ever, where-ever, who-ever
However who-ever touch you'll never breath again ever
So whatever 
I'm a pass the mic down to the B-O-W W-O-W you 
You in trouble

(Lil' Bow Wow)
Uh, ain't nothing like a young cat wit his mind right
And a lime like chasing a dream
At the same time making some cream 
Nickname 'Scary', cause I know how to make em scream
(Is that right?) Every time I'm seen, I'm full of flash 
Every time I'm out pockets full of cash
And about my crew ain't no need to ask
We steady, steady keep puttin' down a smash
I was a thing thing before I be 17 
I know that market folds instead of cones of ice cream.
And that's why I don't care who you are
When it come to the beat you gotta raise the bar becauseâ¦

Chorus: (JD)

This playboy, he gets crunk
Keep that bang off in the truck
With a nick-nac-paddy-whack, throw me a bone
An this playboy gon' bring it ya heard me

(Big Duke)
Ugh ha 
Yes sir
Now Think bout the lock down these holds southeast
Pull cards like teeth lang names like a reef
I wish one of you bustas would spark some beef
I swear to god it's goin' be hard for your mom to sleep
See when I fall up in the club haters still show me love
With dap, cheese and hugs that's the life of a thug
I walk it like I talk it
Told it cause I spark it
Straight take you suckers boy ice and go and holk it
I'm on the patio blowin' cleanin' my gun
While Bow Wow in the front shootin' hoops, wit my son
Big Duke be representin' for the hole Eastside  
J.D. made me lieutenant now watch how we ride

Chorus: (JD)

(Lil' Bow Wow)
I'm tryin to have yall wait to see what I sell
And a block full screamin' up at TRL   
Another thing I want yall niggas to know
I ain't one of them lil cats that's goin' come and go
I got somethin' to show and ah somethin' to say
And knockin' down anything in my way
I don't want haft a plate I want the whole thing
I'm tryin' to escort Aaliyah or somebody on Soul Train
If you so free, I'm tryin' to do five
And be the first kid, on the cover of VIBE
So if you at number one you better save a that
Cause once I get it, it ain't never comin' back 4 sho
