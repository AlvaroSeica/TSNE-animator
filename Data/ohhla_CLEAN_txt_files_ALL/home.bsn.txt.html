[Verse 1]
Hey, I told my city I'll be back but for now I'm leaving
Tell em I'm leaving
Promise I'll be back though, at least once a season
Tell em I'ma get it, I'm who they can believe in
And I'ma bring it back like I kept all the receipts and
My hood show me love, I'm there to receive it
I know I run my city because I'm there to see it
It's hard being a citizen settling up in Michigan
I'm trying to make a name like a fucking birth certificate
Awwwww! Now a nigga on
And the DJ playing my song
And she wanna drink a little Dom Perignon
With Sean!
I pray that it ain't temporary
I've seen it in my dreams though
Mr Visionary and I told them what it is though
Mr. Dictionary and they so fuckin regular
I call em missionary like

[Chorus]
Aww! Can't wait til I get back home
And I'ma put all my niggas on
And we gonna be the ones on TV
Everybody gon see me, you'll see man
Aww! Can't wait til I get back home
And I'ma put all my niggas on
And we gonna be the ones on TV
Everybody gon see me, you'll see man

[Verse 2]
I walk up in this bitch like "Do I need an introduction?"
When you living out your dreams sleep's an interruption
Man, I hate it how the city a corruption
With no concussion or a toolie tucked in
Yeah, we paid or we laid up,
No minimum wages, Yeah, what else can I say? huh
We ain't no bed or a lie but we made up
While they was all sleeping later we stayed up
With drapes up like, Aww!
And I'ma be home soon as I get the crown and throne
And the name across it is my own
Who would've known that we'd be paid off this musical grind
Unusual I'm me and my beautiful mind
That's why my niggas high-class like a school in the sky
I spit the heat, you might see a mirage but no facade nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
