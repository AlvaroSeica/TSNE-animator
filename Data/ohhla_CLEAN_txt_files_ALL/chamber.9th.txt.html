[kung-fu sample]
Right now, we have come to the final stage
You think the prince has powerful kung-fu?
	Actually it's not powerful
	He won't be able to defeat the 9th Prince
Thank you 9th Prince!
	You must be adapted

[Intro: 9th Prince]
The God is back, the God is back
The God is back

"The 9th Chamber, you get trapped inside my hallway" 4x - Ghostface
Killah sample

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, bulletproof notebooks, inside is a message for all crooks
Got your baby father scared to look
Police investigating my last juks, my inkpen leaks blood
Of my enemies, the remedy is ill like Kool G. Rap on the Symphony
In New York City showing no pity, on the grity, I gets busy
Like Sicilians in Sicily, sniffing that snow white
Got you hype, I small iron mics, whenever I write
Take the spotlight and crack windpipes
It's a cold world, don't get caught up in the blizzard
My imagination is vivid, like Maya Angelow but futuristic
I wrote poetry that pave the streets, without a fresh pair of Nikes
My cypher still complete, immortal technique when I freak the beat
Smoke the green leaf then shoot at the beast
For relief, long live the Prince, and I'm forever in these streets

"The 9th Chamber, you get trapped inside my hallway" 4x - Ghostface
Killah sample

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, pencil neck MC's get chopped in they throat
Deadly quote, cyanide notes, provoke rappers to have a stroke
Timberland chuckers, live at the Rucker's
Slam dunk on you suckas, tell Rihanna I wanna fuck her
Strawberry sour diesel, lyrics are furious lethal
Never had the measels, rap warlord like Beanie Sigel
Yeah, here to save the people
Handsome and masculine, like Vin Diesel, no homo
See me live on stage for dolo, rocking Polo
Chest out like Bolo, smacking MC's for promo
Ask Halle Berry, who popped her cherry
A hundred wolves on the Staten Island Ferry
Rap is gospel, but never do a song with Mary Mary
Point competition in submission, black Christ has risen
Granddaddy Flow written on your kitten
It makes some fire, jail cell disciples
Lift the bible, those who went against God were found dead on arrival
Yeah, hang your body on the iced out cross, since you like to floss
Long live the Prince, 9th Prince, the boss

[kung-fu sample]
He won't be able to defeat the 9th Prince
