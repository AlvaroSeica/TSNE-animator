[First Verse]
Hey what's up Pop?  Or should I say Punk?
You supposed to be the Pop to that kid, but'cha don't
I thought you was a man when I met'cha but fa sho
I know, you far from a man, you'z a hoe
Duckin' yo
Responsibility
It's killin' me you do that
That boy just made his birthday, bet'cha never knew that
Since you never gave lil' man shit for his birthday
Do me a favor nigga, make me a license plate
Cuz I did everything for YO kid, you was supposed to
Makin' sure, the nigga grows up, nothin' close to you
Cuz if he did it'll hurt me bad
I know that you'z a man, but man, you'z a fag
And, niggas like you givin' blacks a bad name
That's the main reason I'm changin' his last name
I want you erased, out his past and his future
And if I ever caught'cha tryin' to touch YOUR child I'ma shoot'cha
You're mad at the kid for shit, his Mama did
And you done jumped out his life and he don't know who the fuck you is
But you did me a favor I needed badly
You gave me your family and I'm the Captain here
Your baby call me Daddy

Chorus (uncredited female singer):

Don't mean to be offendin' you, but
Sometimes life is trife and cruel
Any kind of man's got to understand
That somebody's gotta do what'cha don't wanna do

(2x)

[Second Verse]
Look at him, he's growin' up to look just like you
A sight you gone barely see, cuz you'll be locked up half your life fool
I write you just to tell you what'cha missin'
Prison's no excuse when you be loose
You don't pitch a fit to get him
I listen to him cry, and wonder should I chastize
Another man's kid
No matter what he did
But shiiiiiit, if I don't do it, it won't get done
Mama, won't hit son
Daddy, don't get none
Go get the switch
Send a hit if you wanna
But you should send thanks
Cuz I done kept your Baby Momma off the corner
Taught your lil' kid what to do with his Pee-Wee Herman
How to survive this World of mackin' by stackin' what he be earnin'
How burnin' bridges ain't smart
No matter how far you go in life you never know what'cha gotta cross
I wanna thank you for the life that you done gave him
But you should thank me cuz I done raised him
Your Baby call me Daddy

Chorus

[Third Verse]
Look, whenever you touch down nigga, A.M. or P.M.
I'll pay you to see him to save him from bein'
Confused about who's father and who's Daddy
Cuz scars like that, later on would bruise badly
You're sadly mistaken if you're thinkin' I'll be waitin'
Just to make, twenty-three to see, what's shakin'
It's enough takin' him, knowin', that we ain't the same blood
And havin' my other youngin's and givin' the same love
My main grudge against you is there's no sympathy
For your people but they're gonna meet you eventually
And when they do I'm gone be with 'em
Rippin' my ruger, trooper, Dad you done hit 'em
Picture that, them four gone get'cha back
So unless you, totin' bombs you better be open arms
With liable explainations and verifications for everyone
And don't lie to my fuckin' son
Your Baby call me Daddy
