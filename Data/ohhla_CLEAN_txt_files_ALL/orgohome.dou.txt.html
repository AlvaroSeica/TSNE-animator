Bitch go hard, or you'll go home
If you can't handle it uh-uh don't touch it, leave it alone
This some grown man shit, no reason why you involved
Never send a lil' boy, to do a grown man's job

[Dougie D]
It's the Dougie Deekie from your booty, up to you madula-oblan-gata
Putting shit up on your mind, keeping it liver
Their my competition, competition ain't rock shit
We get these bitches dizzy, run circles round em and shit
What you going harder, before me and the mo'
I'm trying to get money, that's stacked up from the roof to the flo'
I wear a size 12-10, from the heel to the toe
I'm kicking down do's in the industry, yelling they want flows
Get-in and go's, haters I'm exposing you hoes
I'm too motherfucking advanced in my game, for you hoes
Any bitch made niggaz, ain't never touching my level
Murdering motherfuckers, so call me the Paul wheels
Going hard on the hands, going hard on the heat
Going hard on the dro, and them bottles of codeine
Going hard on the bar, like I'm full of that G.C
Swimming all through your bar, like the captain of swim team
And my diamonds bling-bling, so fuck it I shine on em
Since Dougie is a rider, no choice but to ride on em
See them 22's up on there on that truck, I slide on em
Ain't no other way I could have it, I'm going hard on em

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
Bitch, I done told you hoes already
I've been in the game too long, to leave and be not wealthy
Dougie D been on the grind, since 1999
The Guerilla Maab Rise, bitch I've been holding it down
Nigga please, how in the hell do you figga you fucking with me
I'm the cataracts on eyes, most making it hard to see
I pass on your little sins, so fast that you call me
While I'm on fire, burning the nation industries
OK, you can play if you wanna
I fuck around with nothing but guerillas, some gone on that water
Got the nine mili fitted, under the linen and denim
Ready to bust me a winning, if one of these niggaz tripping
I don't know what it is, that you niggaz be hearing
If you ain't feeling me now, you will in a minute
I don't rap game better, Guerilla Maab slab rider
When it comes to going hard, ain't no problem bitch I got it

[Hook - 2x]

[Dougie D]
Motherfucker now look, when is you bitches is gon learn
I'm tired of telling you hoes, bitch I got paper to earn
I'm a god damn fool with it, doing my due with it
Get funky like elephant shit, and flies to pigeons
You don't really wanna try, to take it to the extreme
Cause if you take it to the extreme, it's gauge with a beam
Splitting his spleen, flying automatic machines
Me and my team on the grind, mash for the cream
Don't be asking who that jamming, pay attention and listen
That's Dougie from Guerilla Maab, Slow Loud And Bangin' you feel me
Going hard in the winter, fall, spring or the summer
It don't matter what it is, I'm going hard and all over
Making motherfuckers wonder, but my name ain't Stevie
Sending motherfuckers home, cause going hard ain't easy
It's your nigga Dougie Deezie, fa sheezy keeping it greasy
Can that boy go hard, yep please believe me
