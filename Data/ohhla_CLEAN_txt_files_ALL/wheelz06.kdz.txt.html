In high school I was most talkative
Now I'm most decadent
Flow heaven sent
Laced intelligent
Your's irrelevant
Hot like fire cooler then peppermint
Still benevolent
Rose gold necklace
You was left negligent
Case closed, no settlement or arraignment
Spit for my sanity not for entertainment
Never on some lame shit
Lean to the left y'all on the same shit
Imitate the same hit
You think that's dope I say hardly
Don't listen to radio singled out like McCarthy
Trying to be the black McCartney
Got a degree so they call me artsy
But I'm just as vein as the next man
Lacrosse shirt way spinning like a jet fan
Difference is I keep it in perspective
Jesus ain't die for me to drive in a Lexus
He died for me to change the world
I ain't tripping off money and girls
I'm just tripping all around the world

I rather feel pain then feel nothing at all
But I'ma ride it out till the wheels fall off
Only way to lose it to fail to try
But I'ma hold it down till the day I die

Skill tone sinker
Flow taste is choice
You can hear my ancestors when I open my voice
You can hear my hunger with the words that I write
And my eyes is a reflection of the streets of the Chi
Piece of the pie I've been trying to get it
Make my own bed so I guess I got to lie in it
Whether I see a deal, don't waste my time wit' it
Leroy glow shines every time I spit it
No it's not a gimmick
You can still catch me in the avenue pushing in my baby girls Civic
Nah them ain't 20 them tens
N@##% need ends even if I rap about a Benz
I'm just conveying wishful thinking
We in the same boat but I can swim if it sinking
Self starter a go getter I flow better
Waiting for a fall off
C'mon y'all niggaz know better

I rather feel pain then feel nothing at all
But I'ma ride it out till the wheels fall off
Only way to lose it to fail to try
But I'ma hold it down till the day I die

What goes around comes around
And leaves again
Sorta like leaves in the wind
But we finna win
So everyday I try, strive, to get my piece of the pie
