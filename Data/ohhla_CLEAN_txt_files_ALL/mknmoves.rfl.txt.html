[Chorus 2X: Mic Geronimo (Royal Flush)]
It go one for all my people in the pen doing time
Stupid niggas that was force to do a life of livin crime
If you gotta do, whatever, just to keep a little cheddar
(Makin Moves y'all, Makin Moves y'all)

[Royal Flush]
I'm going thru the levels of hell, where life get token by a drug sale
Weigh ya grams on ya scale, holdin block for real
Shootin niggas out to kill, savin money for bail
While the takes make ya squeal, beat you down til you ill
It's a struggle muthafucka, when you walk wit ya steel
While the base heads lookin for someone that deal
While my Ryan died tryin to eat his last meal
Seen it come and go, many succeed, but some bleed
Goin day by day, carryin works like a disease
Do you get the picture, the basic fact, why we strapped
While little kids kidnapped, and cars get jacked
Bring it to a man that could never help you wit that
I'm on the road to the riches, bitches countin my stack
Keep the red eyes, and shootin bullets back to back
Hypnotize smokin la, sometime it feels like pipe
I gotta get mind, you gotta get yours, by all cause

[Chorus 2X]

[Royal Flush]
That's why I sit back and smoke my reefer listen what the Gods teach ya
Fuck a preacher, holdin guns'll great ya
Streets make it hard to survive, so most die
Some niggas is paralyzed, catchin slugs in they spine
Do the mankind, holdin my nine, commitin crimes
Sometime my mind relax, leave the block then come back
It's all affected way cracks and little kids packin gat
Bitches fuckin for stat, New York is wild like that
Perhaps you got an open cause judge in ya face
Sister made a mistake, got you layin upstate
5 to 15, holdin ya ox, from gettin wop
While somebody else fuckin ya girl right on ya block
Niggas bustin that cops for props
These streets is hot, sawed-off shotguns and weed spots
Snitches that eavesdrop, first of all started hard rocks
Stealin outta car, last night they talk nonstop, word

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
