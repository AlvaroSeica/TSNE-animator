Yea this right here
Is going out to all them girls out there
That did me and south wrong, ya know?
Tell you a lil story its the reason

Love, hate, mistakes, tell me wacha think is going on
We date, all day tell me wacha think is going on
Too late, heartbreak tell me wacha think is going on
What's going on what's going on

Yo, eh yo me and miss thang
We run a perfect team
We had all the things all them other couples fiend
Love, trust, good sex, and security
If you ever felt weak Smilez was your energy
Trips across seas, show you the finer things
No more burger king it was fine dine, cuisine
And if it never had it, I don't think it mattered
We were a classic like Nas in Illmatic
I was so deceived, I thought we had a thing
You used to blow my 2 way up wit 143s
Da L-O-V had me blind I would had to see
I trusted my friends, all they were yelling at me
How could you do me so wrong, I don't wanna get dogged
I invested three years ma, plus this song
I'm so confused, where to go? How do I choose?
I guess to find real love I gotta pay my dues

Love, hate, mistakes, tell me wacha think is going on
We date, all day tell me wacha think is going on
Too late, heartbreak tell me wacha think is going on
What's going on what's going on

It seems so good, yo we used to chill in the hood
You made me feel that tingle in my heart like nobody could
And all the long we stood, when times was hard
Even before all  this rap shit made me a star
When I was working two jobs, just to survive
When I felt like killin' myself you kept me alive
What a pair, me and you, we was a match
Different tastes, but you know opposites attract
By my side, hold my head, and kept me strong
Still trying to figure out, where the hell we went wrong
I did what I can, young cat made a man
Stayed and weathered the storm, when most would of ran
Too much pride, and you know men don't cry
Had to let you go even though it hurt inside
All by myself, now I had to turn to these rhymes
Its the only way I know to release my mind.

Love, hate, mistakes, tell me wacha think is going on
We date, all day tell me wacha think is going on
Too late, heartbreak tell me wacha think is going on
What's going on what's going on

Its been a while yea you know time goes fast
Let me tell you though, some things still don't pass
Sit back in the pad, think about the times we had
Try not to let it make me sad, or make me mad
I'm tryin' to move on wit my life, the wound is healed
Yea I'm just speakin' it real, I'm ready to feel
Ready to provide for my seed, a man now
Bet you cant believe its me

You ruined a good thing and all of our dreams
Tryin' to lock me down a lifetime in the beam
Monitoring my calls, griping at my dawgs
I never really understood the cause
My friends were your friends
Your friends were my friends
Your doe was my doe
My doe is my doe
Mano y mano
We'll fought this weather
And everybody that's been through it
Then sing it together.

love, hate, mistakes, tell me wacha think is going on
we date, all day tell me wacha think is going on
too late, heartbreak tell me wacha think is going on
what's going on what's going on
