[Intro: Dre'sta]
HUH!!
 
[Eazy-E]
One two, three and to the four
Eazy motherfuckin' E with the chrome to your dome
Cruisin' in my '64 rag top
I got a lot of kids around the fuckin' block
Now, when I hit that switch I'm bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce and I'm clownin'
Keep the gat in my lap cause I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, buck no haps
I pack a Tech-9, plus, a AK-47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven
Creep, nigga I don't sleep
Bury motherfuckers in the concrete
You tried to creep kind of slow in a Astro
But I peep you niggaz out in my left window
So I blast and I blast 'til I blast no more
Yo, they call the motherfucker John Doe
 
[Chorus: DJ Quik]
[Vocoder Box:] It's John Doe
[DJ Quik:] 4-5's spittin' up outta the..
[Vocoder Box:]the Fourth Door
[DJ Quik:] No return fire cause they..
[Vocoder Box:] Too slow 
[DJ Quik:] What's the dealy?
[Vocoder Box:] We freeze your balls
[DJ Quik:] We kill for the living
 
[Shade Sheist] 
They wanna know why I keep it so simple
I see, that they just don't get it like my Next tale signal
Sheist's on some other shit, Centinella gutter shit
Cards on the table, you can hit me or split 
You see, now I'm funking around and got Quik on the shit
So just imagine, how many hips break when they dip
And all the excessive paper cuts from counting the grip
And how my legs hurt from humpin' back and forth in the whip
At only 35, coverage is a bitch on a six
And I ain't even got my first plaque yet 
Sheist, will still run circles over niggaz who want it
And we ain't even gotta make the bets yet
Nigga what's my name?
 
[Chorus: DJ Quik X2]
 
[Hi-C]
Throat choke a whore, big Gigolo
Pimp the world, handcuff your whore
Twurk your girl, when I step into the atmosphere
Nigga's strapped with fear, uh!
It's he is what I said he is and all
When I pimp bitches all dick and balls
Shade Sheist nothin' nice, new to the game
Get your money homie, bitch, what's my name?
 
[AMG]
Hey-hey! 
We gon' hit these niggaz where it hurt (uh)
Put the worm in your mouth like a perch (uh)
When I'm cum boo you gon' need a cert'
Bust one, jump in the Monte Carlo with a skirt 
Give them naps, give them dap, then I holla holla back
[Eazy-E] Hey, nigga where you going?
Boo, I'm checkin' my traps
Yall niggaz done shitted and stepped back in it
I'll fuck a nigga up all I need is five minutes
 
[2Swift]
Swift, and I pimp whores like it's a gift
I got game so you know I'm "The Answer" like Allen I.
Got your whole style shook like Quilles or Kobe Bry
While money multiply, you haters ask why
No, you can't stop the pimping, the pimpin' is too fly
Runnin' game on your wife, while you out flossin' your ride
But she said: if you ain't busy, or close in the vicinity
Stop on by, and come get the thighs
 
[Chorus X2]

[Outro: Dre'sta] 
And we're hungry, nigga!!</pre>
