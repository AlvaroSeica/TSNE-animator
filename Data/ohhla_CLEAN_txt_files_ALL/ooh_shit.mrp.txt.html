[Master P]
It was a late friday night and a chill was at the club
I was kind typsy from smokin that bud
Walked to the bar seen this bitch fine &amp; Tender
The b*tch at the counter aske a nigga couldnt remember
looked in her face a perfect redbone
took her to the hotel till the chill yo was on
she started rubin &amp; massagin my chest
she said why you were a bullet proof vest
I sai bitch cause im to deep up in this
but just handle your buissness
she reached for my dick like a dipstick
and grabbed my nuts and started to kiss
I rubbed my fingers against her face
before we did it popped in the Marvin Gaye tape
[Marvin Gaye]
Theres nothing wrong with me fuckin you
[Master P]
but back to the story all right
I guess its time to fuck cause off went the lights
bitch was kinda hot
didnt have a rubber but a nigga still hit that cock
side to side back to front she put wip cream on my dick &amp; swalloed the cum
I flipped the bitch over one more time
but the bitch was to kinky to be mine
I looked at my watch said ohh shit
I got a concert to do bitch
she said I guess its time to go, would I ever see you again?
I said probably so
but I didnt know it would be that soon
cause after the concert a nigga dick turn blue
and when I see her Im gonna kill that bitch damn
she did do suckin to my dick

[Chorus]
Ohh Shit, bitch what did you do to my dick x4

Chill man pull this motherfucker I gotta take a piss damn
Ohh Ohh bitch Ohh im gonna kill that bitch god my dick burnin
Chill man bring me to the motherfuckin hospital</pre>
