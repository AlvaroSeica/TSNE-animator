Upside Down 2
Unh
I go by the name of Bei Maejor
If you don't know it's cool
And right now
You rockin' to the sounds of Upside Down 2
Unh

Okay, I got sixteen bars
Fifteen left comin'
Upside down
Yeah niggas still on it
I don't chase macs
I can get it when I want
And my side chick look like nigga main woman
Catch young Maejor in South of France
Bunch of Euros hanging out my pants
Walkin' wit' a model chick
I don't understand, man, yeah
Life is grand
Gotta call from my ex, say she messed up
I was way way better than the next up
And I wonder how she feel when her mama asked her
"Why you ain't stay wit' him? He the best one."
Unh, I don't know
And I don't care though
'Cause I feel good
Flyin' high like a Sparrow
Jukebox on my neck, ice in my earlobe
Why ya girlfriend keep lookin' over here though
After all the things that y'all been through
I mean, after all the things y'all get into, haha
And she a fan like I'm playin for the home team
And you hot, you about to turn this whole thing

Upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love, I found it upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love, I found it yeah

Second mixtape, maybe one mo' comin'
Big wheels on my big car, I'm stuntin'
Everybody eatin', matter fact we grubbin
And I need a little more, Lee pass me the stuffin'
Unh, this year I hope I can win a Grammy
'Cause last year man Beyonce was goin' hammy
Unh, I can't lie she deserved it
I just gotta make sure my album is perfect

Whose to say
(Straight up, whose to say?)
I can't do everything
Well I can try (I'm just tryin' out here you know)
And as I roll along I begin to find
(Rollin' rollin')
Things aren't always just what they seem
(Sometimes I just look at the world and I just...)
I wanna turn the whole thing upside down

I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love, I found it upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love, I found it

No time to waste (sing it sing it unh)
Will it all keep spinnin' spinnin' 'round and around
And upside down (upside down)
Whose to say what's impossible and can't be found
I don't want this feeling to go away

Man I love it dog
I don't want it to go away neither man, for real
But yo, I gotta get outta here man
I gotta go to this show it's about to start
(Please don't go away)
Please don't go away? Nah
Maybe you didn't understand
Bruh like, I gotta go, I gotta show like
Like, like in 20 minutes and I'm...
(Please don't go away)
Tsk, dog you can't keep sayin' that every time like I gotta go to this show for real
Yo, yo thanks for singing this hook for me though
I'm out though
(Please don't go away)
Are you serious dog?
I'll see you in a minute bruh
Alright you said you got one last question
What is it?
(Is this how it's suppose to be?)
Yes, my picture is suppose to be upside down bruh
