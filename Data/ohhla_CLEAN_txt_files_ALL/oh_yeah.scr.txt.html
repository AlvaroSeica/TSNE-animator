[Lil' Scrappy]
I hear everyone of you
We do it like the army do
I can go vertical
Let's go, hey, hold up (hold up)
No!!! Blow!!! Oh!!!
C'mon, crank it, c'mon! Eh! Oh!

[Chorus]
Got Cartier frames coverin' up my eyes
26 inches inbetween my tires
Knot in my pocket better believe three grand
Diamonds on my neck and a pistol in my hand
I'm a get money nigga I grind like hell
when I show em the G's I'm a crank up the scale
Oh yeah (Oh yeah) I'ma crank up the scale
Oh yeah (Oh yeah) I'ma crank up the scale

[Lil' Scrappy]
I aint never goin broke no mo'
As long as my folk keep runners of that blow
they sell it on out then thay bring they back mo'
and ere'body askin what I got that work fo' (got what?!)
got diamonds in my shades the Cardier frames
They look up at my face and tell its woodgrain
And the Ho's be amazed they be like OH!
They can see it from the bar see the way it glows
Yeah! them things twinkle in the light bright
I don't know I just twinkle in the lime light
Got a chevy same color as a can of sprite
