[Intro]
Yeah~!!

[ScHoolboy Q]
Ain't got no jewelry on, still I'm shinin hard
Ain't got no bodyguard, walkin solo through the mall
Bitches and the hoes know, they see me they like "There he go!"
They be like "There he go!" "ScHoolboy, there he go!"
Cheifin like a motherfuckin Seminole
Here we go, off probation probably go to Me-xi-co
Furthermo' can't find this in the store, this shit ain't for the low
Got my daughter swaggin like her motherfuckin daddy though!
(Daddy though) The patio, what a motherfuckin view
Nappy chin hairs, bitch I'm motherfuckin Q
Uhhh, motherfucker motherfucker yeah
Fuckin is my favorite word, reason why I'm fuckin her
She swallow my dick and balls, whatever occur
Purr! Purrrrr, I love that kitty cat
Ass fat, throw it back, I can't believe you wifin that
Deep throat, seven or eleven, she's a double gulp
My pistol drawn, her boyfriend got me paranoid (paranoid)
Nigga try sneakin up on me and I'm makin noise
Uhh, but what I failed to understand
I'm the motherfuckin man, ran into him, he's a fan
God damn!

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
I'm shinin hard, they be like "There he go!"
No bodyguard, they be like "There he go!"
Up in your broad, they be like "There he go!"
They be like "There he go!" "ScHoolboy, there he go!"
#HiiiPoweR bitch, they be like "There he go!"
#BlackHippy shit, they be like "There he go!"
Magnificent, they be like "There he go!"
They be like: "There he go!" "ScHoolboy, there he go!"

pScHoolboy Q]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
No it be this nigga here just lookin at you lames
With my nigga Joey bettin on the Laker game
Even though my niggaz lost, another iTunes check done came
Garcia Vegas, yeah that bitch be burnin slow
'Quip a fo', now the blunts go back around like merry-go
Uh fo' sho', ain't no need for niggaz out here frontin do'
Metapho', how I come up with it? I don't fuckin know
Y'all actin like that T.D.E. don't run L.A
Coast ain't been this hard since 'Pac, Death Row, and Dr. Dre
Word to Dr. Dre, +Detox+ is like a mix away
Go ahead and let the grown-ups work and go somewhere and play
Worldwide holocaust, cause we murder shit
without a gun or knife, it's just a fuckin hit
Pussy drips, rainin in her cervix, I'm a fuckin pimp
Saggin low, crack a nigga bitch just like pistachio!!!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah; Q!!</pre>
