[Intro]
Ran give it to 'em a lil' somethin like THIS!

[Random]
They say Ran found his niche, I prefer in the zone
Rappers tryin to sell me albums with they dirty headphones
I'm like Dusty Rhodes and you Muggsy Bogues
All you gettin for your trouble is a, busted nose
These raps can crack enamel, smoke 'em like a pack of Camels
I walk the streets in dogged Air Forces and baggy flannels
Your track's not official? Then Ran won't rock 'em
Your beats is Fritz pantsed, they got no bottom
Count to the sign like the brim on my fitted cap
Chitter-chattin rappers don't even want a bit of that
Want video games? Well I'm into that too
Your skills are like my bills, they all past due
Still kill at will, but I relax too
The hood is so in me I should get a tattoo
Set it on rap crews, tables at dinner time
Hunger never stops feeding on your tender lines
Super Mario steez the way that I be reppin
Could squash you in the first then I toss you in the second
Throw veggies at you Shy Guys in a driveby
I'm the Bob-omb, about to blow up, so bye bye!
