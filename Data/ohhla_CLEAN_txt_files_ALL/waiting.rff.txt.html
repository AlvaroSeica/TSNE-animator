INTRO: [Odario - talking]
Midnight strikes, so the night begins.  You know how we do, musicians, DJs 
on a mission, the MCs take the stage, have a listen.  Midnight strikes, so 
the night begins.  You know how we do, musicians, DJs on a mission, the MCs 
take the stage, have a listen.  Have a listen, have a listen.  The ill flows 
you know what I'm saying.  This is what's the music's all about.  It's the 
feeling, that vibe, you know what I mean.  I mean you could do the 
turntables and you could do the live instruments and it's all good.  It's 
the MCs and the DJs, you know.

CHORUS: [Odario]
Waiting for the sun
To fall under the planet
And the underground rises
Some can't understand it
Waiting for the sun
To fall under the planet
And the underground rises
Some can't understand it
[All]  We like to party
