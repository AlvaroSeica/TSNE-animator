I was in bed 
Eyes to the sky
Tears on my face and I thought about
(Everything, everything, everything, everything)

Grey skies ahead
God knows I've tried
To look away and forget about
(Everything, everything, everything, everything)

And the light of the moon seems to darken
And the rays from the sun aren't as bright
I need a sign
That I've not lost my mind again

How did I lose my way?
What have I become?
Am I running to you or just running from everything?
(Everything, everything, everything, everything) 
(Everything, everything, everything, everything)</pre>
