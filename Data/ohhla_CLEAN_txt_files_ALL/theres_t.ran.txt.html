Citizens of River City-
I hold your high school captive. With my gangs of students and bosses
nobody can stop me now. Meet my demands or else! -

There's Trouble in river city so you know we gettin busy

I try to maintain a calm demeanor
It's a cold world but we ain't palmin heaters
Listen, We're at loss for leaders
So everybody's following
And not using caution either
Street gangs taking over the town
Broken glass and blood all over the ground
All the good soldiers are down
Despair in the air Not a bit of hope can be found
Theres 2 kids Ryan and Alex
Our only chance of Surviving this violence
Is rallying behind them, supply them with gadgets
or ratchets cuz cats is about Madness
They don't fair, man their past scuffles
Involved steel pipes chains and brass knuckles
Trash cans what ever they get their mitts on
And they took Alex's girl man, it's on
It gets sicker but i Peep the whole picture
They talk tough but as Sweet as Disaronno Liquor
A whole Bunch of gangs and our schools in the balance
Many tougher men are refusing the challenge
But these 2 are special oozing with talent
And crackin skulls till their movement is silenced
Its Time to boss up or get tossed up
Don't get it twisted backwards or crossed up
No time to be awestruck
Gotta get ya lil scrappy on and put them paws up
We got ya back, stick it to these tyrants...
kickin over buildings living like a giant
(p) These little derelicts, asking for a ransom but they know
we don't negotiate with terrorists
that mentality worn out like an old pair of kicks
So we hit the streets, we'll take care of this</pre>
