[Fes Taylor]
You need money? Go and hit a bank, niggas stick to check cashing
Like everybody down with the tech flashing
I don't want shit in the drawers, crack the safe open
'Fore I crack a nigga face open
Niggas ain't joking, Hollywood nigga ain't Hogan
Snatch a nigga til he find out it ain't golden
This for my robbery niggas who take money
Run around saying he got '88 money
Got an old school thirty for a case like that
Classic black Champion hoody, gator to match
I run up in your gate with this strap, where the paper at?
Heard you was holding that bread like a baker rat
If a nigga running with feds, put a paper stack
Right on a nigga head, like he wear Laker hats
Bottom line, niggas kill for that dollar sign
Soul crossing my niggas, you out of your mind
Faggot, money, you get it, if you don't split it
With the hood, hood coming to get it, muthafuckas
I'm riding round town, I'm just looking for a jooks
Tech nine on me, see a bullet full of crooks
Go and get it nigga, want it nigga, push
Cuz a nigga push like my homegirl bush
Wish a nigga would cross my path and lost my math
I leave a homicide nigga with an autograph
My signature move, I'm killing them too
So I'm bout to pass a mil in a few, you dealing with who?
Heard about the G-Unit shit, Koch Record deal
Yeah, I'm still on the block, clothes roll atcha still
I fuck with Deck for real, and Mazzaradi Fox
So you know, S.I./Q.U. connect for real
Section 8, what up to Cafe and them
Flex die chasing paper, spent his last day with him, nigga</pre>
