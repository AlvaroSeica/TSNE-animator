Huh, now don't come to my party if you don't wanna get drunk
It's me and my niggas and we puffin on a skunk
Cus it's true when I'm bent and I'm fuckin I can last long
With some Gin and a grin cus my cocks grown
Now don't trip ho, you like to get bent too
Hit the thai, run, get ya coochie in bent too
By a nigga that'll make ya sick
You know me *scratch*<d>*scratch*<j>*scratch* <quik>, Yeah
Now let me tell you about a party that I threw last year
Niggas kept haulin that party over here
Too many niggas so I had to get a keg of Budweiser
But it had me pissin down my leg
So I bought somethin that'll last longer
Somethin a little harder somethin a little stronger
Somethin that'll definitely make your day
So what you say muthafucka want some Tanqueray?
Now the niggas up on it went got some orange juice
Cus they know that Tanqueray'll get them hoes loose
Fillin up your glass, boy you tryin to trip
Nigga you can't handle full glass, fool take a sip
But I'm not stingy so I filled it to the rim
He went up in my kitchen with a bitch named Kim
Straight bareback in the pussy he dove
Huh, bustin nuts all on my stove
From drinking that.. 

[Chorus]
Tanqueray'll have ya feelin so fine
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind
So if you want to get bent in a big-o way
Come on and drink a little Tanqueray

[DJ Quik]
Now the party started jumpin and the music got loud
A hand full of niggas done turn into a crowd
Out my control the party started hoppin
And the more that niggas drunk, the more that started droppin
Shit, my house got fucked up for certain
With beer on my carpet, gum on my curtain
Niggas in my front yard bendin up the fence
Havin a fuckin great time all at my expense
But I can't trip because I'm knowin
Niggas gon' be niggas and that's just the way shit's goin
But bout damn time I got a visit from the crew
Playa Hamm and Shabby Bleu
With some bitches hollin' (Hey, where the party at?)
I said "The party's in my pants in ya monkey's kind a fat"
"Naw I'm just bullshittin come on in"
Now it was two bad bitches, but they had an ugly friend
Then the ho decided that she wanted to dance
Spilled Boo Farm, all on my pants
Plus she was spokin like a fingero ho
But I didn't say a Goddamn thing cus I didn't know
Then she and ?? started havin a fit
Talking about (all y'all rappin niggas aint shit)
So I spit in her face and socked the ho in lip
And dragged the bitch outta my tent
Cus I was full of that.. 

[Chorus]
Tanqueray'll have ya feelin so fine
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind
So if you want to get bent in a big-o way
Come on and drink a little Tanqueray

Check it, now the bitch straight skated, but then she rolled back
Came up in the party wit a strap, cocked it
Jack, spotted it, hit her on the head and speed knotted it
Bitch dropped the strap and I got it
Rat pack time niggas, stop
The lights came on and the bitch got dropped
It was party over here and party over there
Till the niggas trippin, and started pullin out her hair
Now it really wouldn't nice to see
When they beat a bitch down, and drag her ass out in the street
"And you aint getting yo gat back showty"
Put it in pocket went back to the pawty
And everybody kicked it for the rest of the night
Huh, bud straight facin and the vibe was right
Wouldn't no mo' strappin everything was okay
Each everybody up skated cus we was outta that.. 

[Chorus](2x)
Tanqueray'll have ya feelin so fine
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind
So if you want to get bent in a big-o way
Come on and drink a little Tanqueray
