Yo..check it out
One time for ya' mizzle...

(banter)

Old English 800, or the Genuine Draft
Livin' the High Life is still reserved when it's bad
You can say I have a problem but I say they help me solve 'em
Drinkin' wit' my nigga dog and all the dudes who bought em
It seems I have evolved in to this party animal
I be drunk and talkin' shit, while you pricks take it light
Get off the mic and let me babble 'bout the days of old
When I was young ya didn't know ice teas could be so cold
All I knew was colors..and that stuff my mom made
Nowadays I drink just like it's the purple kool aid
Bro go easy on the ice and add a little more smirnoff
So by the time I reach the bottom I can be clear raw
Dont thitnk it's 'bout to end I say it's 'bout to begin
Take off my shirt, show my belly, offend a few of my friends
Ask Kid Lex we be doin' the most on Melrose with a 5th in hand, yellin' at hoes
And ain't gettin' no play from the ladies who pass
Shit, we're drunk, breath stinkin' without a inch of class
And that's alright with me, cuz baby I'm the Big Mac

(Jibberish/Scratch)

I'm 'bout to cop a fat sack
Cause niggas be like "Every time I see you K, you drunk."
Remarks like that will get 'em judged as a punk
You ain't Crunk, buddy I'll take your latest hip-hop money
Divide it wit' my friends so we can all get funny
Keep your thoughts to yourself, cuz on the real cousin', I'm buzzin'
Tell your peoples I'm a muthafucka..case they thought I wasn't

Mom said: "Chill out..or watch your life go down"
Saw what happened to a friend, well it won't happen again
And I promise: most functional, this bottle here's my petrol
Force field for the unreal...I got no time to kill
Plus..the first time I took a nip I didn't sip
Couple of wine coolers took exactly what it was
what a buzz! Had the young Double stone-knocked-out
Like a sucka who stepped and posed a threat when I went
You can call me what you want: A damn drunk or a fool
But I'm the first to pass out and make the shit look cool
Incidents like that are few like the brew zima or tequiza
That's for women...somebady pass the gin and powerade
Yo it's also time to drink..get off the track
Imma chill with my buddies and toss a few back...</pre>
