[Intro]
Hahahaha, yeah, okay

[Chorus: T.I.]
All I got is trouble (trouble) most you niggaz know it (they know)
Pistols in the duffle, anybody lookin for it (yeahhhhh)
Who want some? (Who want it bitch?) Who want some? (Who want it hoe?)
You know anybody get it if you want some (sorry nigga!)
I'm flyest in the city (city) all I do is ride (ride)
Anybody get it, think I'm lyin nigga try (yeahhhhh)
Ay, who want some? (Who want it bitch?) Who want some? (Who want it hoe?)
You know anybody get it if you want some (sorry nigga!)

[Interlude: T.I.]
Ay you can miss me with the bullshit
And when you see me holla at me if you want it bitch
Okay, you can miss me with the bullshit
And when you see me holla at me if you want some nigga!

[T.I.]
I'm Trouble Man, stay in trouble, trouble's all I know
A snub nose .44 that fitted all my clothes
I love to hustle, trust no one, I'm countin all my dough
In Magic City stacks of twenty, big tall I throw
Keep it a hundred with the D cause they all my folk
I do a party, 100 G's to the mall I go
The slow flow, bought the fourth flo', mansion out in Cali
Got a matte black Rolls Royce, bullet-proof Denali
Better check a nigga head say he better than me
Man if they really wanna beef I'll leave 'em dead as can be
I'm back up in this bitch with Toomp, O.G. what they wanna do?
I shoot a nigga, catch a case and beat it in a month or two
Le'go~!

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[T.I.]
A half a million dollar chain, shit's so big it's a shame
Millionaire still hang with niggaz out there dealin cocaine
It's King mayne, you know I ain't finna deal with no lame
Still might catch me in Bev' Hills sittin tall in them thangs
Walkin out the {?}, throw them junkies all in my chain
My address and my ensemble, that's 'bout all I'ma change
Man play them games if you want to, all my niggaz with it
We can bang if you want to, let all you niggaz get it
Off probation and I'm waitin for a nigga to jump
You disrespectin the crown, and double barrel I dump
Like, "Ain't he learned from that time that he done did in the pen'?
Man here this skinny nigga go talkin 'bout pistols again!"
Ahhhhh~!

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
We been through this, how many times have you niggaz forgot?
I get locked up, get out on top whether you like it or not
Let us remember 'fore my Fed case, now I was a headcase
Hit a nigga neighborhood, tell 'em bring the yellow tape
I calmed down for my kids and my mom now
Run up on them sucka niggaz, you can put your arms down
And FYI, I never put my arms down
Tell the ATF I got three more .380's left
Hahhhh~!

[Chorus] + [Interlude]
