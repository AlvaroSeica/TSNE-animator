[Verse 1]
I'm waking in the morning getting my little boy ready for school
I'm combing his hair brushing his teeth and fixing his food
Tommy Hilfiger outfits and pressed socks
Telling him that I love him putting sandwiches in his morning lunchbox
Momma going to work early now its just us
Go and make yo bed and tell ya daddy what you want for breakfast
Everybody's fool now its time to go
I'm dropping you off and I'm coming to get you bout 4
If I don't come and get you than ya mama will
saying to myself will I live or will I get killed
I kiss him on his cheek I hate to leave him again
Dear God I hope I get to see him again
Cause they don't know about the laws I break
About the weed I smoke and the pills I take
And they don't know about the money and ki's
About the busters I shot or the ones that done shot me
And they don't know that they daddy is the man
I wish I could explain but they won't understand

(chorus)2x
Only If you knew what ya daddy do
And only if you know where ya daddy go
And only if you knew what ya daddy did
And Only if you knew where ya daddy been
And Only if you knew what ya daddy did

[Verse 2]
Zero understanding with niggas tryna fuck with mine
Been Selling this mothafucking dope since the age age of 9
Started off selling dimes from dimes to whole ki's
Sacks of weed from oz's to whole trees
Selling dope out my resident
and I'm Making more money than the mothafucking president
I remember in the days being raised
a skinny lil nigga on the block with french braids
13 when I first seen a triple beam
I use to dream of becoming ah trafficing king
K kell of my mama and my kids
And buy a house where the rich black folks live
Ah candy green pontiac cadilleena
Baby diamond ring on my lil girl left finger
Hairobones around my son neck
Timberland,Ralph Lauren,Tommy Hilfiger shortsets
I'm at home with a closet full of birds
Drinking tangerin taking pills tryna calm my nerves
I get no sleep I can't eat
I'm trapped in da dark and I'm marked by a black beast
I'm thinking about my son
I know I'm loosing my mind I'm playing games with my tech 9's
Cause he don't know about the life I live
About the bitches I smoked and the bitches I had to choke
He don't know that his daddy is the man
I wish I could explain but he won't understand

(chourus)2x

[Verse 3]
Private schools family picnics and street lights
2 kids and a dog mothafucking fight
They can't follow in my foot steps
because the fast life aint shit but ah fast death
I got to in the game they can't win
Die young or die old in the pin
I show my baby's much love shit
Ain't got to teach em' bout the streets cause its already in they blood
Let yo education be your first backbone
And the dope game something to fall back on
My daughter ask me one day daddy why you always crying
Cause she don't know that one day I'm gone have to do some time
And one day she might have to go to church
To see me in ah white tux leaving in ah black hearse
A young nigga with ah whole lot of stress
Before I let a chump kill me I will kill my goddamn self
Yo daddy is the man
I wish I could explain but you won't understand
