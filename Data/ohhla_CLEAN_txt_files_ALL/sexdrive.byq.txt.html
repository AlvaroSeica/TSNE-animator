[ScHoolboy Q]
Yo; I'm started up, let's go
Uhh - dippin through yo' solar system
Hopefully steal your heart, you'd be the victim
Uhh - no I wouldn't share
Hey! I did the crime, now close your eyes
Let me ease your mind, I won't steal you blind
Came right on time, just keep behind
Let me guide the way, it's your lucky day
Let's fornicate, play the way that grown ups play
Teach you how to drive a stick babygirl it'll be okay
First gear, second gear
Third gear, hell yeah~!
Panties droppin, I can treat her proper
Puff my pass in your lust would you let me be your doctor?
I can please you right (right) let me give you life (life)
Little CPR (R) can I use your car? (Ayy)
Pedal to the flo', see you drive me hard
Youse a superstar let me be your bodyguard
Wetter than tsunami, lord, let me dive in-
-to your tidal wave, now be amazed

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q] + (J Hene Aiko)
Scorpio, sex drive
Gemini, sex drive (Pisces)
Sex drive (Virgo) sex drive (Aquarius)
Sex drive (Saggitarius) let me be your sex drive
(Satisfaction fills me up inside)
(Can you turn me on?)
(Be my sex right, only if your sex is right)
(Can you put me on?)

[ScHoolboy Q]
As the world spin, we gain power
Your cervix stay on wet girl you a stormy shower
Mindfuck you girl, undress you we can fuck for hours
Day and night no rubbers we love this no covers
Freak you with my tongue, you also go down where I'm hung
Open up a chapter begun, we can build like a factory hon
The nexus sits right on the sun, solar eclipse as soon as we cum
Soon as we cum in a new {?} rest livin they dumb
We cruise; you done won my heart over how can we lose? (lose)
From my fantasy to real life, you I choose (choose)
Came a long way from "fuckin friends" we was due
Ooh, just me and you, ooh, just me and you (uhh)
Never scared of commitment, see you my boo (uhh)
We can get ghost, get lost, and the bond is true (uhh)
Flyin through the city, clouds reconciled
Sayin vows fuck around and have a child

[Chorus]

[Outro 2X: J Hene Aiko]
Break me down and build me up again
Love me 'til the sun comes up and then
We can fuck and fuck and fuck again (again, again)</pre>
