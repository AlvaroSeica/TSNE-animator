Keep 'em out

	[Redman]
Yeah, you can't keep a Gorilla out this motherfucker
Yeah, yo, oh my God, oh my God
Gorillaz runnin' down on you real hard
Oh my God, oh my God
Gorillaz runnin' down on you real hard
Yo they call me Redman on stage slash Gorilla
So big I ride on back of vans like Mogilla
My chest is hairy as fuck my back as well
Shit my granddad was built like a half a well
We rip through cell doors we don't ask for bail
Happy Gilmore Gorilla whooping ass for real
Beat you down till they knock me for a Nike jail
Then I'm back on purple hills so I can jack the ?
They pass the ? I'm drunk tipsy punk
My sweat ? whisky I'm looking for Lewinsky
So I can get head, done, get off me girl
I'm crooked like white folks dancin offbeat
Gangsta, I'm waitin for that ? to cross me
Shut up, now you gotta pay for morphine
We are them Gorillaz you starvin the fillers
We deep like ??? with car in the ??

Yo, I hear Gorillaz goin
All my Gorillaz goin
Brick City Gorillaz goin
N.Y. Gorillaz goin
Californian Gorillaz goin
My Florida Gorillaz goin
My Texas Gorillaz goin
Shack Town Gorillaz goin

 Here you go
 Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine
 Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine
 Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine
 Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine

	[Redman]
Yo, who's that hey? It's Mighty Joe Young
Lights, camera, action, roll drums
Now let me ask you what it feel like
What a banana in your tail pipe
Immortal I walk the jungle with my ? showin
See me coming, better leave like when bar closing
At the bar posing with my Shawn ? brim
On the bra to get her bra open
See a Gorilla take it they don't ask
I'm pissed on the bar's desk with laid on cash
My whole state, I'm a grown ass man
Soul survivor I write with Bobby Womack hands
Holding me down when I'm the one
The last one with a bomb and the timer on
You are them Gorillaz you starvin the fillers
We deep like ??? with car in the ??

Yo, I hear Gorillaz goin
Yo, my Gorillaz goin
My Minnesota Gorillaz goin
My Detroit Gorillaz goin
My Oakland Gorillaz goin
My Indiana Gorillaz goin
My Atlanta Gorillaz goin
Yo, my Canada Gorillaz goin
I hear Gorillaz goin
Yo, I hear Gorillaz goin
Yo, I hear Gorillaz goin
Yo, all my Gorillaz goin
Ha, I hear Gorillaz goin
Yo, I hear Gorillaz goin
Yo, all my Gorillaz goin

 Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine (Gorilla)
 Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine (Gorilla)
 Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine (Gorilla)
 Get the cool, get the cool shoe shine (Gorilla)</pre>
