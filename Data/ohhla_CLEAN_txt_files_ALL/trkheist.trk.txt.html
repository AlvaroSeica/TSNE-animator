[Truck]
Call a friend, bag on me, let it all out loud
It's time to celebrate, just brought my CD out
Plus on top it, you know I got a story to tell
How the biggest Truck heist, didn't go so well
My man Blade, love stealing Escalades
Put me on how me and my crew, gon' get paid
How we gon' get out of the ghetto, and our dreams come true
Whoever thinking the man here, when you needing the loot
Listen up, I'mma put you on with stars and in the booth
Alright, here's the plan, matter fact, wrote a list
How we gon' all get paid and eat offa this
First off, whatever we do, don't take ya mask off
The driver loves to keep parting the macs off
And the boss, if we slip, we doomed
You know me, I don't got no problem going to war with this goon
Things go straight, we be alright soon
More than enough money, to fill up two rooms
You played me, I don't care how you feel
Cut ya ass out the truck, the forty on wheels
Stop playing with the clutch, back the 18 wheeler
Throw on my headlights, to avoid the cops
Cuz the boys pull me over today, they getting shot
I refuse to let one of these pigs ruin my plot
We got about an hour, to the next town
And the nearest truck stop, is a half a mile down
Paroles, shit gon' buck off
With Truck's work, that can put up the X of block off
And the detour, almost got me lost
Here they come, just hurry up, we don't got all night
Make sure you show a little thong, and the jeans fit tight
And hit the highway, like you wanna hitchhike
Person, keep driving up cell Fords
And the way you snuck up on the truck, he never saw it
It was smooth, everybody keeping they cool
Bless through the hammer to his face, told him, don't move
Peep the Iron in the back, trying to break the lock
His partner caught dead in the Ac', get hit by the gwap
Beno the get away driver, now fucked up, who be?
You should of saw him on point, too many gangsta movies
Come on ya'll, let's bounce, it's time to ride out
Let's go somewhere on the low, so we can hide out
Everybody put in work, that's what you call a team
Let's reep the benefits, and divide this cream
Back at the lab, the last of these hurried up bags
Me open them up, and on our face was lke dag</pre>
