[ VERSE 1: MC Peaches ]
Watch my smoke as I explode, yo check it
Gimme a beat and a mic and I wreck it
A female MC, what does it mean?
Do you expect me to kick it and pump it like a hottie queen?
Sayin eenie, meenie, minie moe weak raps
I don't think so, Peaches isn't into that
I get rough and tough and kick it smooth
Bein a female I have a lot to prove
I come off hard with a dope delivery
And most of the male MC's can't get with me
I do my thing, suckers are left behind me
Like I said, watch the smoke in the '90s
Back on the map cause Peaches is the best, you see
So wipe your forehead and ah, stop sweatin me
All woman, yes I am, yes I am
How can I be second when I gave birth to man?

(She's not just another woman
She's not, no no no)

[ VERSE 2: MC Peaches ]
The pen is picked up and the rhymes are written
If Peaches made it, it must be hittin
Harder than a bat, in fact just like a truck
And if the comp survives it's beginner's luck
I've been through battles and one by one I stomped
Out competition, so yo, there is no comp
And as for slippin, come on, let's deal with facts
I go to work on my off day cause I'm all that
I wreck shop (word) from ounce to ounce
Get the papers, yo, then it's time to bounce
Think you can deal? Give it your best shot
I swing hard, suckers are gettin dropped
I move fast, you know swiftly
And I'm the one to kick your ass if you diss me
Feminine but still hard as they come
Peaches ain't just another one

(She's not just another woman
She's not, no no no)

[ VERSE 3: MC Peaches ]
Bein a f-e-m-a-l-e
Makes it d-i-f-f-i-c-u-l-t
Stayin ahead of the game I must do
Cause once you slip or fall behind you're through
The will to survive, that keeps me goin
A funky bassline, yo, keeps me flowin
Takin what shoulda been took last year
It's '91 and Peaches is now here
Givin you more than you expect
And cause I'm a female you can't accept
The fact I can pack a jam as quick as any man
And leave the place with more dough in my hand
And when you think I'm gonna quit
I pause - and then say some old fly shit
Thought a woman couldn't rock as hard as a man?
Well, Peaches can</pre>
