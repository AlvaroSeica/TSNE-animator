[Intro]
I roll up, I roll up, I roll up, shorty I roll up
I roll up... I roll up (hahahaha)

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, it's your anniversary isn't it?
And your man aint actin right
So you packin your Domiar luggage up
Callin my cell phone, tryin to catch a flight
You know one thing straight
I'll be there girl whenever you call me
When you at home that's your man
Soon as you land you say that's all me
But shit ain't all G with him no more, you ain't entertained
Since I meet you a couple months ago you ain't been the same
Not sayin I'm the richest man alive but I'm in the game
As long as you keep it one hundred I'a spend this change

[Chorus]
Whenever you need me, whenever want me
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie
I ain't gon' flex, I'm not gon' front
You know if I ball, then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby I roll up
I roll up, I roll up, whenever you call baby I roll up
I roll up, I roll up, whenever you call baby I roll up

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uhh, I try to stay out your business
But on the real you're so obvious
And if you keep fittin me in your plans and fuckin up
your man's gonna catch onto us
That white sand surrounding us
He be handcuffin, he should work for them officers
If you rollin I got a spot where I can put you on this medical
and send you home doctored up
You wanna ride with me cause you say that he boring
Wake up you rollin weed, cookin eggs in the morning
Ain't scared to spend this money God know I'll make more of it
First you was in the sky now you say you in orbit

[Chorus]

[Wiz Khalifa - singing]
No matter where I am
No matter where you are
I'll be there when it's over baby
Cause I was there from the start
No matter if I'm near
Don't matter if you're far
All you do is pick the phone up lady
And I'll be there when you call

[Chorus] - sans last two lines

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I roll up, I roll up, whenever you call baby I roll up</pre>
