[Chorus: Bicasso]
It's a kid on the corner of his block 
And there's a genius in his room with a deep thought 
It's a grower in the hills with a crop 
But if they all come together what they got? 
A little power unified to make a knot 
Well of course 
And if a plan to expand is endorsed for some more 
Lend a hand, pay attention and explore 
We all in this people we all in this...

[The Grouch]
Well I don't know where you've been 
But if you got here I'll let you in
Welcome you with open arms, now let's begin
Set the scene, serious as fuck minus the mean
Build up your esteem and get to growing 
I'm showing fools a place where they can come 
And release the dumb deeds they've done
Cause ever since I was young I've been shown I wasn't alone
I roamed with my unhoned skill
And anyone who talked down on me 
I knew they didn't know the deal
My belief was way larger than life 
Taking charge with the might in my mind
And recognizing that in other mankind
I knew I was on the right path, see
Combating a fight, wrath raging for way too long
And you might say you're strong, proud, loud and so on
Steadily doing damage every time you get your flow on
I build in Oakland, Chicago and everywhere else I go
There are people who know exactly what I mean
More than a scene, great minds think alike 
So when you find hate it ain't tight 
Decipher the paint right 
Get your sights set on what's important
Stop distorting the big picture
When will it hit ya? 

[Chorus]

[JC]
A rich man in poor man's body 
That's what I was growin' up, hustlin' for the buck 
Mentally torn between just to be or not to be
It gotta be it betta, be betta days ahead of me 
Cheddar cheese, luxuries, were never gave to me 
Instead I shift from home to home, feelin' lone was I prone
From the destiny in which I lay to wallow
To live for today and give a fuck about tomorrow
The sorrow and hatred is my only perception 
Because all my memories are filled with lies and deception
The stressin', deprived of a childhood and adolescence
Learn my lesson, now it's all good 
I never thought I'd see the streets of so many hoods 
My heart done broke so many times, boy it's harder than wood 
It's been a long road, but you know the game unfolds
I listen to the stories told by the cats of old 
Tryin' to tell me I don't know about strugglin' 
Like in the slave days, but ain't shit changed 
Instead we ain't wearin' chains, huh 
I feel the same pain but it's escalated
Niggas feel free, but still ain't emancipated
So getting' faded is what's left off the green leaf
Hindering the mind, but when I'm high I feel fine
Been in the wrong place at the wrong time
All the time
Tryin' to journey into the light
But the dark ain't far behind
I'm at a color disadvantage but I manage
To make it work for me by the use of my talents
And use common sense to gain dollars and cents
And ain't ashamed of what I do
Until the day I repent

[Chorus]

[PSC]
I stay humble through the many of fumbles I found trouble
And trouble it doubles in cities amongst the rubble 
I learned from my mistakes to miss another 
Resembling ignorance, isn't it all in the struggle? 
Got you wondering, why? 
You wanna bubble so you hustle 
Building the muscle that's not needed 
So the other one you ignore it 
And feed it more fantasy and you store it, the bubble 
(Your circumference of comfort) 
"Ghetto fabulous" important in society 
A circle of clubbing and girl fucking amounts to really nothing 
While we fronting for the public 
We shove it down the throats of our kids and watch em love it 
And got the nerve to wonder why shit's fucked up
The government lucked up, by giving fools the right to bear arms 
Cause we shoot each other down after last call... 
What the fuck y'all???
