(*talking*)
4...3...2...1, ha
Where my keys at
Let's go all the way in

[K-Rino]
I'm the breeder of much needed, magnificent reasons
I make it rain by throwing loose change, the strippers be bleeding
Got the full intelligence, of 22 grown men
You can mute me, and I'm still louder than your whole team
You couldn't bump me off with ten rifles
You in the final stage of being washed up, I guess that mean you in the spin cycle
Don't have to ask me if I'm ready man, I'm clearly down
My demeanor's so agg'd, that you can hear me frown
These rappers wanna knock me off feet
But I'm taking em out every night before I sleep, like they were false teeth
I'm lyrically wild, I thought that I was senile
Cause I got a different number, every time that I hit redial
Riding down your street, thrashing the beat
I'm one deep driving the car, from the passenger seat
See I don't play, I'm all about bis'
I eat hundred dollar bills, cause I like to put my money where my mouth is

[Chorus]
I'm ready to ride
All these undercover sissies trying to rap
Don't make me ride
The word mercenary gotta stay strapped
No, you can't hide
Swinging on em, with a superman slap
Don't make me ride
The word mercenary gotta stay strapped

[K-Rino]
Last of all, your skill ain't worth discussing
Normally I'd start by saying first of all, but I can't see you being first of nothing
Build a vocal monument, then put my book in it
My verses are hot enough to smoke you, till you look tinted
I'm seeking war with you, a quick loss is calling you
I sleep on watered down toilet paper sheets, without falling through
I searched through the daylight, until I found night
I sink my teeth into the beat, called it a soundbite
An underwater fortress, is where I record this
I don't use a mic, I rap into the blade of a swordfish
Once and for all, I make negative responders fall
Phone battle Holocaust, ten thousand rapper conference call
Flammable tongue mask, with a lightening effect
I can have two left feet, and still kick you right in your neck
Schooling you, is what I beautifully do
I black out and then record, so when I hear my songs they new to me too

[Chorus]

[K-Rino]
You harmless as a daffodil, I attack and kill
I'm in the mood for fast food, I want a seven piece whack rapper meal
When I get adamant, they tell me that I have to chill
Assassin lyrical genius, K-Rino backwards skill
You can't prevail, cause you fraud on a large scale
Like a homeless cat, claiming he having a garage sale
For years straight, I'm moving at a great rate
You at the crib, working out with a shake weight
You faking tough, get your vocal communication up
We was talking face to face, and he was breaking up
Don't need blunts to complete, verbally leap stunts
My calendar got 365 days, in each month
I race through time and space, like a TV chase
Every two thousand units, I pop out of the c.d. case
I'm the underground, hydrochloric acid buyer
Quieting baby rappers, with hundred pound pacifiers

[Chorus]</pre>
