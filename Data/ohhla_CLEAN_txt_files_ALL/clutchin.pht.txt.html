Alright, (RED ON DA TRACK) Lil phat... get used to me ole bitch ass niggas...
Now nigga I'm clutchin, is you cluthcin, cause I'm clutchin is you clutchin [x2]

Wat it is, wat it do?
It's all on u, who gone feel the hecka who gone get stoopid with pooh?
I'm really thuggin I'm clutchin bitch I ain't scary
I'm a hit you in yo face for ivy, h, ronny and berry
So thank twice for you come playin with me
and I ain't gone let you feel it till you come playin with me
It's on my lap, it's in my pocket
on my hip, under my arm bitch I got it
Big stacks, can't tote no wallets, they hatin
cause I'm comin threw swervin and bitch I'm wildin
An I ain't playin, I'll burn you like a deli
ah yea, ah yea, ah yea bitch I'm ready
I grew up up in that top, I'm a southside baby
I was yung runnin des street I ran my mama crazy
Wen I was 14, I had a highpoint
I bust that sumbitch jammed on me... fuck the high points!

But I was clutchin, I was clutchin, is you clutchin, cause I'm clutchin?
My nigga I'm clutchin, is you clutchin, cause I'm clutchin, is you clutchin?
Yea I'm strapped, bitch I'm strapped [x4]

My son called(hello) say he got his first... welcome to redrum spelled backwards is dum
Dem yung niggas they bought it all, they the sickest, they the dummest and we all dawgs... believe dat!
I be clutchin at a early age, and I'll buss it...
Pat said fukk dem niggas phat, cause they ain't clutchin...
Dey be reppin like they do, but they don't hold the hood down
Dey was tryin to, but they stood down...
Gotta be in ya blood, to be a thug, gotta be ready to buss if you scrap up in the club
Cause des days niggas ain't playin no mo, catch you slippinwit yo bitch sprayin you and yo hoe
You ain't strapped betta... fukk a left quick... go take a nap cause des streets on dum shit(4real)
If you want me betta get me for I getchu first, you ain't clutchin? den it's gone really hurt!

But I was clutchin, I was clutchin, is you clutchin, cause I'm clutchin?
My nigga I'm clutchin, is you clutchin, cause I'm clutchin, is you clutchin?
Yea I'm strapped, bitch I'm strapped [x4]</pre>
