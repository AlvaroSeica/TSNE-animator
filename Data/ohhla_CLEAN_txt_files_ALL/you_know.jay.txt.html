[PJ]
Trunk open paint dripping, fifth and grill
European head lights, screens glowing wood wheel
Loaded steel stash spot, try to jack you ass'd out
Bust a clip off in your ass, and hit the gas and smash out
Reload my clip and keep on flipping, let my 4's continue tipping
PJ why you do that shit, he had to go that boy was tripping
Tried to catch the Hustler slipping, had to put him in his place
Look at what that slab do, now I got a motor case
Now the police looking for me, saying I'm a fugitive
Witness say they saw it all, but don't know who the shooter is
Me you know I'm still riding, damn fool I'm still sliding
Sitting my ass on butter seats, hold it down I'm never hiding what

[Hook - 2x]
Got them 84's low to the ground, (you know the deal)
You try to jack, I'ma lay your ass down (you know the deal)
Boss Hogg Outlawz run the town, (you know the deal)
Fuck with PJ bitch and I'ma clown, (you know the deal)</pre>
