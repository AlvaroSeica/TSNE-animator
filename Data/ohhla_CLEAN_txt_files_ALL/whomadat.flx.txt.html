[Intro: Styles P]
My niggas say murk 'em I'm a murk 'em
I ain't even gonna second guess that shit
L.O.X. Nigga!

[Funkmaster Flex]:
FUNK FLEX! LOX! WHO YOU MAD AT?!

{Jahlil Beats, holla at me~!}

[Verse One: Styles P]
Death comes in threes, you know that it's three of us
Money I ain't see enough, weight when I'm rein up
I won't even kick it with a nigga, he ain't G enough (uh-uh!)
I let the Glock block you if you violate 
Homie you a hossa, that's a pig that don't fly straight
Big willie shit'll make a nigga eyes dilate (dilate) 
Cocaine and her-on spots throughout the Tri-State
Bitch ass nigga bet a bullet'll make you gyrate (I betchu)
...My homies ate whenever I ate (word)
I'm a crooked nigga, never could I fly straight
Living hella proper, dinner in a helicopter
Playin "Big Poppa", chillin with the Knickerbockers (I'm chillin)
You talkin business, you can talk to me (talk to me)
You talkin bullshit, you can talk to him
Backward talkin to me, you wanna put a hawk in 'em
Food on the menu, he's done, put a fork in him

[Chorus: Styles P] (Jadakiss)
Nigga who you mad at me or yourself?! (Sixteen and the ratchet, tucked in the belt)
Nigga who you mad at me or yourself?! (You should've went and got a job if you needed the help)
Nigga who you mad at me or yourself?! (I'm just a dough boy d boy acquirin wealth)
Nigga who you mad at?! Nigga who you mad at?!
Nigga who you mad at (me or yourself?!)

[Verse Two: Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo! My heart is broken (Yeah!) This ain't hip hop no more
It's vegetables now spit the art of chokin (Ha Ha!)
Lame ass songs I mastered the art of smokin (Uh Huh!)
Use to take the train to get pussy in Hoboken
Now I'm in that coupe, we all on fire by ourselves
But we can sell the Garden out with the group (LOX)
Gemstar razor (Yeah!) Still got it locked in the streets
If my album was on Koch or a major (DONNIE!)
Rozay, Dutch and the dog
Jeezy force man I just killed the club
You fuckin with the truth, I'm nice in the booth
Thirty plus, still I relate to the youth
I stay Coke Boy fresh like French and them
Niggas know L.O.X. still mention them
Wash machine final spin rinsin them (Yeah!)
Wash machine final spin rinsin nigga!

[Chorus: Styles P] (Jadakiss)
Nigga who you mad at me or yourself?! (Sixteen and the ratchet, tucked in the belt)
Nigga who you mad at me or yourself?! (You should've went and got a job if you needed the help)
Nigga who you mad at me or yourself?! (I'm just a dough boy d boy acquirin wealth)
Nigga who you mad at?! Nigga who you mad at?!
Nigga who you mad at (me or yourself?!)

[Verse Three: Jadakiss]
Uh, yeah, who, HA-HAHHHHH!! Uh
When you become accustomed to winnin you know it's not luck
Fool, the word loyalty, L.O.X., a pile of bucks
I done fell in love with a Columbian
Now they got me runnin out of space to put the money in (haha)
Where I'm from, nigga ain't eatin, he ain't hungry then (uh-uh)
You already know if they spittin, I'm lungie-in
For the record if he ain't dead it ain't a hit (nah)
If it's less then a thousand grams then it ain't a brick (nope)
If it ain't got a tax ID, it ain't legit
And if a nigga ask about me tell him I'm on my shit, let's get it
Walk-ups, drive-bys, head shots, high fives
I could do the time, I just need a cell with Wi-Fi
Big hole, exit wounds, shotguns, my size
Same adrenaline rush you get, when you skydive (woo!)
I'ma roll somethin up, cause I wanna blow (yeah)
But before I go dawg I just wanna know
What~!

[Chorus: Styles P] (Jadakiss)
Nigga who you mad at me or yourself?! (Sixteen and the ratchet, tucked in the belt)
Nigga who you mad at me or yourself?! (You should've went and got a job if you needed the help)
Nigga who you mad at me or yourself?! (I'm just a dough boy d boy acquirin wealth)
Nigga who you mad at?! Nigga who you mad at?!
Nigga who you mad at (me or yourself?!)
