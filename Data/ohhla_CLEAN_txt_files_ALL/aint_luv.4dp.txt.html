Six feet deep, a nigga headed that way
Cause I'm steady committin sins every day
Pops is a junkie, my mama's a slut
But I don't give a fuck, I still hit the cut
I'm goin out for my damn self
And everybody else can hang it up on the shelf
I'm bringin this shit to a end
Motherfuck a family, to hell with a friend
And I hope you don't think cause I know ya
That I won't lay ya down and just blow ya
Motherfuckin ass straight to heaven
Then I reloads my .357
Bitch I got popped, so what I'ma do
But take them motherfuckers out on you?
I used to pack a gun for protection
But now I'm aggravated with no affection
And I don't give a fuck, so
If yo ass ain't down, then yo ass gots to go, hoe
And I guess I won't make it above
Cause I was pushed to the point where it ain't no love

[ VERSE 2: ? ]
I've had it up to here with this motherfuckin bullshit, damn
I pray every day that I won't go kill a man
Since every day is like a test, G
Shit, my ass better pray that the good Lord bless me
Cause if he don't I won't make it through the game
Damn near about to go insane
My pops locked up servin three terms
My moms does the best she can but she don't understand
Why I gots to get mine
Shit, I'm sick and tired of puttin my fuckin ass on the line
Always comin through for a nigga
But when the times get hard ain't nobody down witcha
They wanna front like you owe 'em
Now I'm pushed to the edge, hah, it's time to show 'em
I gotta do what I gotta do
When it comes to gettin my shit, bitch, I don't love you
Don't give a damn what you think, G
You ain't payin my bill and you sho ain't fuckin me
Nobody ever gave me shit, hoe
And that's the way the story go cause ain't no love, bro

(Ain't no love)

[ VERSE 3: Klas 1 ]
Every day in the jungle a nigga falls in the paint
I try to be strong but sometimes I just can't
It's the same old thing
I'm losin homies every day to the madness of the game
So I keeps to my damn self
Cause ain't nothin promised to a nigga but a quick death
And once I'm gone ain't no return
It's either straight to heaven or my black ass gotta burn
I'm still lowdown doin crimes
I wanna make the switch but I'm runnin out of time
And I just might click so don't ask why
Just prepare to die, motherfucker, die
I'ma end this shit right here
Cause I know that my time is real motherfuckin near
And the shadow of death is 'bout to catch me
Cause it ain't no love where I'm at, G
