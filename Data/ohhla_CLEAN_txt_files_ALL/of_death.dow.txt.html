Here Comes The Knightowl... Knightowl
[Gun shots]

[Mr. Shadow]
Eventualy I'ma have to see the penitentury
For sending all you fake mothafuckas to the cemetry
I'm granting death wishes, for all those bitches that be yappin
Acting like they fuckin hate me, but they bump 'Me and My Shadow'
Battle me, why try, bullets fly, I'm the type of guy to poke an owl in his eye
If it hoots, I shoot you know my rhymes are absolute,
To your death I salute, watch your ass when I lute
Mothafucka, whatcha got to say about your family dismissing you
Your homies dissing you, when shadow blessen you
I heard about you and the homie rolling through the rival park
And you didn't want to cap cause you said you had a bad heart
Ya fucking coward, you talk alot of shit
Talking about you serve some times you never did a bid
Then you're doubting out cha ass saying I don't right my lyrics
You just want me to write some weaker shit so you can go and hear it
You did remember NOTORIOUS, then you shook the hook again with VICTORIOUS
Knightowl you got to give it up it's getting old, you're 34
Your life ain't shit and you're acting like a hoe biactch

I'm bringin hell to this mothafucka cappin
So it's time for some military action
It's the shadow of your death here to take your last breath
So run mothafucka cause I'm blastin

[Mr. Shadow]
Fat boy fat boy where the fuck you at
Man I heard it through the vine that you tried to bite my rap
For that Ima slap you just like a slap box
Pop the 44 slug blow your top off
Calling me a faggot ask my nina who was in a
They seen you on the table bustin raps for extra dinner
Ya fake like the rest of them punk mothafuckas
that surround you, watch when I find you
I got my slope aiming at these three bitches
mothafuck snitches, I hit him with the three sixes this is manditory,
I kick this story about these phunny bunch of lops, perpitrating in my
terriroty
Like that bitch 'Rob', you ain't no good
You's a wanna be thug never busting a slug so motha fuck ya hood punk
Now onto a bigger hoe named 'Royal T'
It's the shadow of your death fool remember me
Never in your life have you banged with the cliq hoe
You and bitch freelo can suck on my dick
It's 'Mr. Shadow' dumping rounds on these fuckas
Said my named to many times
And that was your first and last mistake mothafuckas

[chorus]

[Mr. Shadow]
I kicks nothin but the real up on the mic
I wasn't out in ceetho getting in a gun fight
So you say, tell whos gay
This is all my game and your a shame to play mothafuckas
You brag about your shit while you roll in your caddy
Yous nothing but a fake and takin loot from your daddy
Had he never been here you'd be broke,
Like a joke I provoke mothafuckas till they bolt
Hold up, remember staright clown and left you with a frown
So get the fucking point that no one wants you ass around
I found out about you claiming to be rich
You still live with your parents so quit acting like a bitch
You took my lyrics out of a song, that was wrong
You felt it coming on cause you know that I'm the bomb
Intimidation gots you goin in circles gots you crazy
You will never fade me thats the reason why you playa hate me follow me,
No one will ever be believin all the lies that you be hummin
I had that bitch 'Knightowl' running, he knows that 'Shadow's' comin
It's a thin line between foes and friends
Causes you're hated once kiss your kids good bye
Because it the begining to your end </pre>
