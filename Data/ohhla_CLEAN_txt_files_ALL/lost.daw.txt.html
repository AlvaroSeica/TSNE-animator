"I had no choice, you were already lost.."

[Dawaun Parker]
Yeah, D. Par', uh
Yo, yeah

What if you was lost with no cross?
I know what it's like, when you gotta drink a fifth to doze off
Tipsy, Hennessy, whisky, Zoloft
Ketamine, Pepsi mixed with Popov
Drinking NyQuil with no cough
Coca, cheeba, blowed off reefer
Anything to keep the Reaper from trying to sleep ya
Dreams of, suicidal thoughts like ether
All that mean, it's finna get hot like gasoline
Hundred shots hit the same spot like Gatling
Worse than his worst nightmare
And what's worse is he died with a smirk like "Yeah"
Thought he was O.G.
Told his niggas "Bring an oz. to hell, we can smoke weed"
Homie that's crazy talk
Cause once you lay in the coffin, you're saved or lost

[Chorus: Phil Beaudreau]
Played too hard, burned too bright
Stepped too far past the line
I had crossed, I had crossed (I'm just trapped in this place)
Left me scarred, left me high
with the stars in my eyes
I was lost, I was lost (I'm just trapped in this place)

[Dawaun Parker]
Yeah, yeah, I'm the type of nigga that sell coke
I had to switch that so I could see heaven like "Hell no"
I ain't never snitch or tell po'
The homie at the four-fifth stitched in the Tickle Me Elmo
Bullets velcro to the loop where the belt go
Now he in a box, all he hear is the cell close
Only see the daylight for an hour
Caught beef, lost teeth in the shower
Some of them dudes kill, most of them dude's cowards
Some of them al-Qaida, the other the towers
Me, I'm none of the above
Ain't even a scratch on the boy, yet I'm covered with blood
Y'knahdamean?
Now they think life's all jokes like comedy kings
Until they start bombing them things
That used to be a whole state, now it's not anything

[Chorus: Phil Beaudreau]

[Phil Beaudreau]
Lost in this place
Lost in this place
Lost in this place
Lost in this place

[Dawaun Parker]
'Ye sang "Jesus Walks"
But if you ain't walking with the boy, then you're just lost
I heard cats got heaters on
Bet they ain't never felt flames like these before

Uh, I tell you what you need to know
Right now you on the Earth, where you go when you leave it though? (I don't know)
I'm on my knees praying for forgiveness
God please send me from the perils of this rap business
cause nowadays they say anything
Black heart, black soul, all black everything
Married the life, splurged on the wedding ring
Where's the fat lady? Time to let her sing
Before it's over I'm about to blow, I put that on everything
And everybody bout to know bout him
Already got a hundred hoes at the shows throwing clothes at him
Cause promoters throw dough at him, dealers throw coke at him
Long as the streets love him, haters try to throat-stab him
Cut him up, but I run amuck
Every day I'm "Hustlin'", you know, Rick Ross
Keep your eyes open, don't get lost

[Chorus: Phil Beaudreau]

[Phil Beaudreau]
Lost in this place
Lost in this place
Lost in this place
Lost in this place</pre>
