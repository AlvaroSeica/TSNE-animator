Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uhh

I think I got a single

[Chorus]
It ain't hard to see that I'm doing my thing
and I ain't going to stop til everybody know my name
Cuff your chick, cause I take that money
But first I wanna see if I can take over the world
Woahhhhh.woah woah oh ohhh
Take over the world
Woahhhhh.woah woah oh ohhh

Lady, she down
Yeahh yeah yeah
Lady, she down
Yeahh yeah yeah

Yeah watch me take over the world give me just 5 minutes
I'm going to take over your girl
Fuck you pay me with the money in my pocket
I'm on the first class rocket, trying to fidn where the pocket
You can meet me on the moon, but you might not make it
They can't breathe where I'm going, how many times am I gonna say it
I'm on a jet beat road, seems like the lakers trying to get more rings
In a pack of light sabres

Yeah

I'm on L-club in the socket
I ain't worried about you haters you ain't even in my hot puck
The money in the way, all I see is profit
I'm a go, go get it. Try to see if you can stop me

[Chorus]

I'm headed to the front, shotgun
Hop up out the way, lookin' flyer than the top gun
Headed to the top, pent house level
So I think I can see the stairway to heaven
Sitting on cloud nine, can you can go see me to go smoke
All about my money, you can see it in my money, you can see it in my clothes
Cause everything goes, every chain gold
I done paid my way down this yellow brick road
I rememebr sellin' all I own
Now all I do is sell out of all my shows
All eyes on me while I'm on stage
Let's take over the world like pinky and the brain..

[Chorus]

Lady, she down
Yeahh yeah yeah
Lady, she down
Yeahh yeah yeah

I said Anything, baby. I can Take over the world
young money in the power. I could take over your girl
Yeah, I could take over the world. young money in the power
I could take over your girl. Yeah, I could take over the world
