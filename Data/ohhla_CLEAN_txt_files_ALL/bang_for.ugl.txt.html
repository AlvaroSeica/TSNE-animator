Once again...
Here we go...

[Verse One]
My soul is not for sale
Got a one track mind goin off the rail
As I, save the day what I mean to say
Ugly Duckling's on the way like a green beret
Uh-huh, no Grammys or platinum plaques
No chicks with fake noses or plastic racks
Just raps over tracks made of classic wax
Our past is the mic then I'll pass it back

Hey! What's happenin? You ready for action?
Hands get to clappin, the place is packed in
B-Boys backspin to DJ scratchin
The roof is on fire and I'm holdin the matches
Flows so cold it'll run to your nose
I'll stomp a mudhole and muddy your clothes
I'm harder than the hardest, hard as hard can get
Andy C heat it up like a bag of briquettes

Some cat gave us a bad review
Well I read what you said and I laughed at you
But that's cool, do what you have to do
We don't give a rat's ass if you clap or boo
We got bang for the buck, bang for the buck
Locked and loaded up with bang for the buck
Bang for the buck, bang for the buck
Right get on the cut and let's bang for the buck
Bang for the buck, bang for the buck
Locked and loaded up with bang for the buck
Bang for the buck, bang for the buck
Locked and loaded up, let it go~!

{*scratched: "Stop look and listen cause you haven't heard the latest"*}

Y'know
{*"Ladies and gentlemen!"  "Once again, back by popular demand"*}
("Bust it")

[Verse Two]
On your mark get set now I'm ready for rhymin
I'ma catch wreck like trains collidin
I stick to my guns like gum in the holster
And come high noon you'll get hung like a poster
I'm straight to the point like a bayonette
Mics melt in my hand like a Raisinete
I spit random words like I had Tourette's
You want bang for the buck? Place your bets

I got bang for the buck like a prostitute
In the group with the rep you cannot refute
As I move to the light I'm in hot pursuit
for success in my sight so I got to shoot
And it's - locked and loaded, hammer cocked exploded
Best not to hold it (hot) you get scolded (stop)
Then reload it, definitely
Cause on stage the mic's like a weapon to me

Einstein rocked the fat loop before he wore a tracksuit
Back in the day when Brother J had his black boots
{ahhhhhhh} I got lungs like a vacumn
And I'ma blow it up like your bathroom
I got bang for the buck, bang for the buck
You wanna knuckle up I got bang for the buck
Bang for the buck, bang for the buck
Einstein on the cut, BANG~!

Bang for the buck, bang for the buck
Locked and loaded up with bang for the buck
Bang for the buck, bang for the buck
Locked and loaded up, let it go!

{*"Stop look and listen cause you haven't heard the latest"*}
Yeah... that's right!
{*"Stop look and listen cause you haven't heard the latest"*}
{*"Ladies and gentlemen!"  "Once again, back by popular demand"*}
Help me out y'all ("Bust it")

[Outro]
If you like what you hear then clap
Put your hands in the air and clap
If you like what you hear put your hands in the air
and clap... just clap
If you like what you hear then clap
Put your hands in the air and clap
If you like what you hear put your hands in the air
and clap... clap</pre>
