[Verse 1 - Lil' 1/2 Dead]
this is dedicated to the niggas that's down with me
and all the motherfuckers who clown with me
to all my homeys who set to smoke the pound with me
and H-D dog will never ever try to down you G, cause I
got much love for my niggas on the eastside
and all my dip cause I bitchy
straight rushing 6 feet under dirt
and a homey puttin' in work
fill in the spun of a bitch real quik
you know why
cause bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I'm in erection to all the homeys who die
and my niggas still falsin' on the eastside (right)
and now it's time for me
to blow up the whole fucking industry
I'm regulatin'
you all I'm hatin'
but my son, I'm still dedicatin'

[Chorus (2x) - Lil' 1/2 Dead]
this is dedicated to the niggas that's down with me
from day 1 from the L-B City

this is dedicated to the niggas that's down with me
from day 1 from the L-B City

[Verse 2 - X-Con]
I comes deep on the sweep
with this heat when I speak
simple ass nigga get the tag from the G ranger
calls in danger like a menace
I'm in this to win this
like Willy McInnis, monkey ass
G's ride on the eastside
when the park is dark
and ladies is stark
niggas get took
and road up in the book
look
I ain't a criminal but a crook
and I doubt that the cops gonna cuff me up
scuff me up
that's not a duck when I bust
lust
on the sunday ground ain't been the same
so ask why I have to rearrange game
and now I kick lyrics on a track that's phat
it's like that
I'm comin' from a small ??
and that's why so many young niggas mumble
I dedicate it to the niggas in the jungle

[Chorus (4x) - Lil' 1/2 Dead]

[Verse 3 - Lil' 1/2 Dead, X-Con]
just a small dedication to my niggas you see
every day straight bellin' in the big L-B
I gots to get love to the hood you see
cause the city where I'm from means good to me
gettin' love when I'm chillin' at the V.I.P.
and all the hookers and the ho's wanna fuck H-D
I got much love for my niggas from the D-P-G
and I'ma turn the mic over to the X that C

oh and the Californian state pion
with this young ass nigga gone compliment
and then
it's a life for a life when they come
ain't no ride cause they checkin' they guns, niggas
I think it's gettin' over no no plan
the legal system gonna lockdown Batman
so damn
on the streets is a good vibration
but homeys in the pin get the full dedication

[Hook (4x) - Lil' 1/2 Dead]
