[Sister Souljah]
Am I a black racist? NO! 
Not unless you believe in the Boogeyman
There's no such thing as a black racist
Racism and white supremacy are systems of POWER
that deny the majority of black people throughout the world
the right to life, freedom, proper education
To contorl our own ideas and thoughts 
and the ability to make money and control your own culture and religion 
 
[Chorus]
Black racist, black racist ("So wrong, so many times") 
Black racist, black racist ("...so many times")
 
No black person or group of black people any place in the world 
have the power to deny white people or Europeans access to anything
What can you CALL me? CALL me prejudiced! 
Because I prejudge situations based on my own understanding of history
 
("So wrong...")
("...so many times")
 
Some of the Indians trusted white people
And if you ask any black brother or sister today 
how many Native Indians they know
They'll tell you that they don't know any
You know, white people KILLED THEM!!
And they did so in the name of friendship, civilization and Christianity
 
Yo, yo, engineers! Hold up, I gotta go to the bathroom
I'll be right back, I'll be right back..
 
[engineers]
{*talks into microphone*} Alright, cool man, sounds great
{*turns off mic*} Sound great, my ass! {*laughs*}
Fuckin' mooley! I think she went to the bathroom
to take a shit out the other end (Fat-ass black bitch!)
Tuna-flavored vulva peach, fuckin' Sheba
(Man, if that nigger said that shit in the old days, she woulda been hung!)
(Ay man, what the fuck is a she-whitey?! What the fuck..)
{*laughs*} I don't know, oh wait wait, here she comes...
 
[Sister Souljah]
Alright y'all I'm ready, we can pick off, y'know right where I left off from
 
[engineers]
{*talks into mic*} Uhh, sounds great, let's go to uhh.. top of the fourth

Crackers don't do anything unless there's something in it for them
They make charities because they get salaries and it's tax deductable
They give you scholarships to their schools 
so you can learn to think and act like them
So they can use you against your own people 
like these weak pitiful black mayors and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas
 
Honkies join the Peace Corps so they can spy on other people's culture
and make money off the things they learn...
 
(Black racist, black racist, black racist, black racist)
("So wrong, so many times")
 
White people give you welfare with a set of rules 
designed to keep you ON welfare, ignorant and lazy
and then talk about you on TV
 
Crackers pretend that the television and the media is really "for the people"
But we all know that its only purpose is to make more and more advertisment dollars
And sell you products that you don't even need
 
Why, honkies create economic conditions where the majority 
of black men and women cannot make money
Force us to join the United States Army
And then order you to KILL OTHER BLACK PEOPLE in nations around the world...
 
White women, you know they're real slick
They try to say that they're different then white man
Get your sympathy and then they wanna sleep with your black men
White feminist say that they are the sisters of black women
Ask you to join their women's movement
Then they want to give you five hundred reasons 
why you should leave your man and let them EAT YOUR PUSSY!
 
White people pay desperate brainwashed black people to join the CIA
Make them join black organizations and then use them
to kill off black leadership like they did to Malcolm X
 
Crackers say they believe in God, painted Jesus Christ white
Violate ALL the justice that Christ stood for 
and use his good name to make MOOORE money money
 
Man these crackers will make times so hard
They'll turn your momma into a hooker, turn you daddy into a pimp
Throw your brother in jail and have your sister smoking woolahs and crack
And in the end, whitey will call ALL OF US a bunch of low lives
and deny the fact that he had anything to do with any of it
FUCK ALL OF Y'ALL!!!
THAT'S RIGHT, I SAID ALL OF YA!</pre>
