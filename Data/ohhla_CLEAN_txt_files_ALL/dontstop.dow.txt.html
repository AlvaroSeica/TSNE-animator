[Mr. Shadow (talking)]
Oh yeah
Mr. Shadow up in this bitch once again
Introducing' my homeboy Young Siccness
Chillin' in the studio with my man Vicious
Whisper, and the homeboy Hittman
Beyond Entertainment, Whisper
What you gotta say bro?

[Whisper]
Drop some heat on these fools Shadow
Better reckon know this!

[Mr. Shadow]
It's the darkness form around you
How I found you don't know
All you remember is The Shadow 
That done put you on the floor
Two of the sickest, Shadow and Siccness
Bring the drama, you know where I'ma stick this
Witness with this Triple 6
Our 6's knockin' bustas off my shit list
Hit these muthafuckas wanna buck us for the title
I'm homicidal making fools a thing of the past
Like chapter's in the bible
My rivals and foes all know the survivals
Are known in the streets
But I rome you won't make it home
Let it go, In San Diego in the capital of the Metham...phetamines
Applying fiends, that don't believe in dreams and I
Been feeling happy on the trigger like the homey Whisper
Won't hesitate to separate you from your mom and sister
It's the dismissal of your ghost, I'm the host
And I put that on my lady and my baby, I'm the most
Requested, I suggested that you left the shit alone
But you didn't wanna listen, so I put the chrome to your dome

[Chorus] {Mr. Shadow}
Don't stop now...keep bangin
Load jo clip...start sprayin'
Prayin' won't...save you
Mr. Shadow and Young Siccness
Inflict it on you
2x

[Young Sicc]
Well as I step on the scene
People askin', "Who is this?"
Introducin' on the list 
I'll be that thug Mr. Siccness
Wouldn't wanna be fucking with this
And if you try you'll meet the Smith and West
Me and the homey Shadow, teaching these gangsters a lesson
If you guessin' that your gonna be tested, fool I gotta confess
I'll be quick and bring the sneak, wiping these suckas up off they feet
These lyrics get told, explode through your area codes
And quick to be change in crowds and two of murder's most
I'll be bring the funk, you talked your smack, it's on like that
Better be watching your back 
Cause ain't no telling when the Thugs on thee attack
Watch me get my dump on, while you get your slump on
Ask your lady who'd she jumped on
It was me, I got my FUCK ON
You whack ass fools, you need protection
Quick to bring the sickness like infections
So stay the FUCK UP OUT my section
These gangster lyrics assassinate muthafuckas like 1-2-3
When I seen you'd had enough, then I know for sure youse R-I-P fool

[Chorus]

[Mr. Shadow]
It's the third and final chapter of the disaster that we caused
Make your calls, strap your balls, bring your boys and watch them fall
Like Niagara, I'm harder than Viagra when I'm on ya
And I'm quick yo drop bombs, representing Killa-fornia
My records are golden like the state
Who can relate to, the level of a devil, motherfuck you and the rebel punk
It ain't where you're from, it's where you be
What you doin', what you see
Remain silent and listen carefully
It is me the one that you wanted to haunt, I finding my weapon
You will not be stepping, I'm gonna be checking these 
Motherfuckers I'm bind to be breaking lead up less than a second
Your section is discontinued, Shadow and Sicc up in you
Two of the hardest on the menu, steppin' hell is where I'll send you
Defend you no one can cause I got chu in a ditch
And that's what you get when you act like a bitch
Remember these words like prayers, cause my behavior
Is disturbing to those who apposed, trying to survive like ?? fool

[Chorus]

[Mr. Shadow (talking)]
HaHaHaHa yeah
So what you think Whisper
You think me and my homeboy
Young Sicc drop shit on these motherfuckas or what dawg?

[Whisper]
You know this, now they better really reckon know this

[Mr. Shadow]
Yeah, that's how we do it California style
Mr. Shadow, Young Siccness, Lil' Whisper, Hittman
Beyond Entertainment, doing it the Vicious way, the only way Motherfuckas

[Young Sicc]
And we out fools, fucking beyond</pre>
