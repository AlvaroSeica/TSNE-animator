My cup runneth over
Jonny walker on crushed ice
No Christmas but a wonderful life
Most y'all rap niggaz cuffies
Shit for brains
I just remain the shit, no toilet
All magnificent you can't spoil it
Nor fight it dope, but I never got to light it
All I do is write it, poet laureate
A purple label, Ralph Lauren
Always feel good on a cut like Neosporin
Shooting star headed for the Moon like Warren
Came along way from begging mom for them Jordan's
Dudes boring, is hard on the beat
I bleed on the page
Been ill since playing streets of rage
Damn, there's been a minute
I'm still handling them been a spitter with lyrical finesse
Pray I sell 6 digits
I can sleep well knowing that I got my spirit and my soul
Damnit, I'm oh so cold
Stepped off the throne just to step on a peonce
Cracked ribs spilled extra sauce like Leons
What the fuck he on
I'm a star
Naledge born I illuminate neon
Y'all crab rappers throw stones like Egon
I'm trying to touch the sky
Y'all play the corner like Deion
I speak reach sorta like I had 3 arms
Lights, camera, action, nigga we on
What the fuck you see-on
The phoenix rising, exactly what the rap critics fantasizing
You ain't realizing
You ever listen to the future toast to the present
Pour some liquor out for Brappy then I keep it stepping
Brushing my fade wit money on my mind
Looking in the mirror and envision a one of a kind
I'm Mr. opulent vocal tone is perfection
No rec league, Naledge do it for profession
Look in my rhyme, look in the eyes of me, I'm laughing
I know I'm what you're trying to be
What more to say w/o rap
Will I still be straight
I tell 'em I can never be straight
Till my people ban together like they signed with Diddy running for cheesecake
Or soundscan(?) held back from my release date
Label stress had me drinking till I couldn't see straight
Latin Dan told me to hold it tight like a knee brace
I'm so hip hop, put your trust in me
You ain't know that's why I just fucks with me</pre>
