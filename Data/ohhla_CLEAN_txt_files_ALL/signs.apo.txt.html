[O.C.]
Sips from the chalice of Moses, keeps me immune from the bite of a cobra
from slippin and fallin into a coma
The seals are broke, we seein the signs
What was hidden is now revealed, take it inside
and decipher the language, knowin too much - dangerous
Some'll die in they sleep, but many have died painful
Listen to whatever my brain say
Or call it a case of intuition when I listen to anything
Modern day Rome with government in control
Politicians get you snagged in the net; cell phones
of all size, watchin this economy capsize
Guilty's bein baptized from priests to rabbis
Spots gettin blown, boxers in the drag like
cars gettin towed and they blame it on the coke
Riots in London; smell of chaos in the air is quite pungent
Wars jumpin off like bungee
Secret sects in effect - initiation is sex
Partnered up with the same body parts
Males who like, acquirin wealth, sellin they soul at a marked up price
Serious game rollin the dice
Phantom killers behind brass shields wield power
Roundtable of brokers whose main goal is dominance
Unexplained sightings in the sky provoke fear
How can it be? Feminine the place where all the gold is
Diplomats gettin cases tossed
The role reversed, the crime is if they wasn't at fault
I'm keeping it life, as told, by my cousin Chuck
"You sayin too much my nigga" - I gives a flyin fuck~!
Why whisper when my voice is loud? With common sense to address the crowd
My momma she blessed the child
God's gift in the form of a male
with the vision to see things before they manifest themselves</pre>
