Song:   I Am That I Am
Typed by: thesickest702@hotmail.com

Without the alakazam, God said that I am
Because God is, without the showbizz
ain't no magic in His linguiztics
He is the definition of exsitence
God is, before any thing was
And God did, before anyone does
From Alpha to Omega, without the boom
Shaka, had it goin on before He allowed Sega
A winabega will take you on a long tour
He got much more then you could ever explore
Infinite I'm omnipitent without the scent
Say what He mean, mean what He meant
The montementur, mister advantagous
So magnifico and yet solo
Uno, oh no, did this mess up the photo
In your God protfolio prepare for the Bollo
That you know, and I know and others do also
God is displayin and sayin, what I am that I am

[Chorus]
Forever past[I am that I am]
Forever present[I am that I am]
Forever future[I am that I am]
The Great I am that I am that I am

In the beginin was the word, the word was with God
And the word was God and God is still large
Though some find Him strange
He can't exchange or rearranged, and He sure can't change
Makes Himself known, makes Himself heard
Makes Himself seen, all through the word
Sometimes alot in a little, sometimes in a riddle
Sometimes when He's revealin He's hard like Peanut Brittle
But He'll brake it down in bite size pieces
With a complete thesis, that we can eat up
Like Reese Peanut Butter Cup
So good to the roof of your mouth it'll get stuck
So you can savour the flavor forever
To keep your spirit strong and your intellect
Clever, pull the lever on all the things you think you know
Shed the dead leaves so you can grow and sow and reap and expand
And humble yourself under the mighty hand of the one that said I am

[Chorus]

He's on the present, [to the] up [to the] down
[To the] left, [to the] right, [to the] broad [to the] day [to the] light
[To the] door [to the] way [to the] truth [to the] life [to the] father [to the] spirit Jesus
Christ, is back on the scene, forever exsistening almighty supreme
The thing, who came to earth through a supernatural birth
To give a worthless some worth, the pharasiss and the saduuces
Always try to catch Him up in a siese but please
How could they do this, catch the super-califrac-expiala-smoothness
Everytime they would try to judge He would step up to beat down the grudge
He said you know your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day
They said Hey! How do you know the father Abraham
You're not ever 50 years old my man
He said verily verily understand
Before Abraham, was yeah, I am
