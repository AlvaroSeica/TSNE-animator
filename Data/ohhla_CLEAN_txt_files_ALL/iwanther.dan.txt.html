[Verse 1]
She more fresher than a crisp pair of them white Nikes
Or the wrist wear glowin' like lights
Nice; shorty entice with come-hither stares
But a nigga scared, sweat rollin' like dice
Down the brow of the brother man
If I don't play my cards right then another can, and will
Chill, chill, just tell her how you feel
If anything else, she'll respect you for being real
Chill, chill, just tell her how you feel
If anything else, she'll respect you for being real
I try to keep myself cool and composed
'Cause what I like most, she got so much soul
And what I might hope is that she'll be my soul-
Mate...wait...let me grab a plate of her greatness
Grab her by the waist and embrace
This impatience? I hate this
Heart goin' boomp-a-boomp-boomp like a bassist
Are these feelings real, or
Is it a mirage like oasis? Hey chick

"Yeah, ummm, I know we don't know each other and all but um..."

They call me Danny Vanderpool the Third
And I would like to conversate and/or converse
Whichever verb you prefer, that would be great
Let's say we get to know each other better, and go on a date
And go on a date...and go on a date...

[Chorus: Brittany Bosco and Danny!]
(I think I'm in looooooove again)
I try to confront her...but I just freeze
(I think I'm in looooooove again)
I want H.E.R....but do she want me?

[Verse 2]
This ain't a Chris dis
But baby girl I wanna +Kiss Kiss+
Under mistletoe, Christmas gift
We can slip into the abyss of bliss
I'm fixated on you lady but you get the gist
You strike me as a girl who's into 'rithmetic
So don't dismiss this rhythmic equation I made, but
Me plus you equals X-O, X-O
Gets no better than this so let's go
And let's grow...you can use my heart as escrow
But the decimals ain't enough
There ain't enough ways I could explain it
Pure, untainted
Pleased to have hastily made your acquaintance
Untampered and down sister
Boy I tell ya, I been down since the
First time I heard about ya, my man from Queens put me on
So how could I ever string you along, hmm?

"Yo, just give me a shot, I PROMISE you we were made for each other yo..."

It MUST be fate
Let's say we get it crackin' on a much clean slate
Trust me
They say great things happen to he who waits
Come kick it with a brotha 'cause these other cats couldn't relate
They couldn't relate...they couldn't relate

[Chorus: Brittany Bosco and Danny!]</pre>
