[Fes Taylor]
Aiyo, doc, let me the fuck up out of this bed
Got this nurse hemmed up, made me go upside her head
Officer stand back, slide doc the keys
Cock and squeeze, I'mma scappel this bitch, before my soul leave
They let me lose, walk backwards with the nurse, to the stairs
Count to ten before you run, whispered in her ear
Ran to the front entrance, threw duke out the ambulance
Hide behind the wheel in the carivan
I'm pulling out, they closed the front gates, so I rammed it
Damn this shit cocked out on me, change plans quick
On foot, hopped the gate, people looking at me, out they window
While they eating hot plates, I heard 'stop, jake'
Yeah right, take flight, ran through somebody crib
Still behind me, see flashing lights trying to find me
Cop car blind me, coming head on, one jumped on my back
We on the floor, wrestling for the gat
Pop pop, thought it was me, guess not, keep it moving
My shorty crib like, eight more blocks
I can make it, if I don't stop, dip through the yards
I seen a hung ten-speed, in somebody garage
Hopped on it, ain't no need to check for the breaks
Only thing on my mind, son, how to escape
That's when a cop van hit me, I flew off the bike
One tried to handcuff me, but I put up a fight
I was whipping his ass, too, until another one
Hit me with a nightstick, son, and iced my shit
Fell to the floor, thirty cops, mad as fuck
Took me to Riker's Island infermary, all beat up</pre>
