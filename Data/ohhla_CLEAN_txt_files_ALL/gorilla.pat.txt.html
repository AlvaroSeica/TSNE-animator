[Verse One]
If you thinking I'm straight then you better think twice
And you ain't got no cheese then I'm jekyl and hyde
'Bout to click on this bitch cause she need to learn me
Beat her with my pistol when I thought she burned me
It's the first of the month you can call me Sambo
I'ma dick this ho down cause I like to gamble
In her purse I ramble
On her head I trample
Where the hell the damn doe
Old silly ass hoe
You know green I'm gon' blow
And I like to toot snow
Sippin' 'nac with your cap is the perfect combo
You can be a Jane Doe if you call the po-po
(female voice)I'ma call ya momma a
Bitch that's a no no
Don't get personal, I'll never let go
If you did wanna run you'll get beat to the flo'
I'ma go-rilla pimp you can call me great ape
knockin' teefus out ya mouth need to get ya shit straight

[Chorus]
I'ma gorilla on the hoes, dig dat
I'ma Pimp nigga you ain't know? Dig dat
I'ma a mack mane on the stroll, dig dat
I'm out here trying to make a ho, dig dat
Cause I hustle on the low, dig dat
I ain't tryin' to go for broke, dig dat
So bitch don't try me ho, dig dat
If you do I'ma cut ya throat, dig dat

[Verse Two]
Talkin' smart to a pimp you done broke the first rule
I'ma come on your job I'ma act a damn fool
When ya boss walk in I'ma play it off cool
If he step in our biz I'ma slap his ass to
All that loud talkin ho need to gon' settle down
'Fore you friend have to pick ya ass up off the ground
I got love for ya purse meaning that I love you
Married to this cheese first and I'm screamin' I do
No money for a mack mean drama for a ho
Paramedics toting you through the trauma center do'
Busted lips broken leg but I got my bank roll
Tried to put a struggle up so she got her eye swoll
Buying you Taco Bell but a pimp eating Steak
Corn Bread Collard Greens Chit-a-lings on my plate
Always late for a date and she always trippin'
She can hate my fuckin guts but she lovin' my pimpin'

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Mixin' game with some 'nac is a deadly potion
If I hit it from the back bitch I want devotion
In ya pussy strokin'
Ho a pimp is spoken
DOA if you try to play my emotions
I'ma crack a hos dome I ain't broke the damn law
Another nigga (on) my phone so I broke the bitches jaw
You done quit ya damn job and you need to start hoin'
Boostin clothes playin tricks cause a pimp ain't goin
In the club shakin ass they can bring plenty cash
But ya get mo' loot with a VIP pass
Say ya ass got robbed when ya ?shoulda got a hundred?
Now you get the fuck up out of here go and get the money
you dummy tryin' to pop phoning me a get ya killed
Bitch I ain't the chargee I'ma charge you for real
So don't get it twisted I'm the pimp you the bitch
Either bring the loot quick or you get ya throat slit

I'ma Gorilla on the hoes...</pre>
