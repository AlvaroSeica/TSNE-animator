[Chorus 4X: Free Murda]
When I say 'don't get danced on', I don't mean the dance floor
We put feets and hands on, (you and your man, boy)

[Free Murda]
Nigga ain't miss a step, daddy, you better, step, daddy
I love older women, bout to be a step-daddy
Like Baby Boy, I'm nothing like Jody
I would of had homie, crawling like a baby boy
With the gat to his head, like what you take me for
You must be crazy, dog, I let the eighty off
Clap, go and tell your aunt, to stop by
Cuz crack'll only 'sell a man' like I'm Popeye
I get it from papa, papi get me deals
Wise guy, index finger, get a semi chills
Jerk me, why try, that get many killed
I'm high, why I never let the Henny spill
Won't stop, I want that ice band on my wrist
That'll have your bitch, and whores, stance on my dick
Like she doing jujitsu, plus my hand on them bits
Know all my kicks new, got you paying all my shit

[Chorus 4X]

[Free Murda]
And my son half oh-yay, talk that shit
Had a fiend sing like The O'Jays, off that hit
Nigga, off that click, gotta save the good
To have niggas stomachs looking like the kids from Save the Children, ey
Got more bread and cheese than a Sicilian, ey
One in your head, one in your head, I'm a villain, ey
Listen, Scrappy, I put one through your nappy, head
You be dead, on your way to Daphne
Want me, better catch me, you know where I'm at, B.
And you better 'duck', nigga, like you Daffy
Yeah, I'm in the trunk, nigga, you know where the hash, be
Now, D "for" an L, like I sing Laffy Taffy
Taught breezy, gon' pop me, dog, and you scooby, too
It's really easy to spot you, dog, like you Scooby-Doo
In that fake Gucci shit, you get no coochie, bitch
You better 'do the right thing', like Mookie, bitch
I send your wife, the eye line, without a kuffie, bitch
You getting wet, like aqua, by some goofy, shit
That coke had the cook, don't even try to look
But if you still, you lose a hand like Captain Hook

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
