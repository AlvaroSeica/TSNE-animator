[Esham]
I hear a voice in my head, my head hears voices
So many choices
I'm coming down off a bad trip, and I'm sick of all the bullshit
It ain't my fault, it's all my fault, who's fault is it ?
It doesn't matter, can you understand
I live the life of a madman
I'm psycho, suicycho
Not Michael on a motorcycle
I can't understand myself
Man I need help
Who am I ?
Am I who you thought I was
If not too bad cuz
I ain't trippin, nah I'm trippin, cause you know I be trippin
You don't know me
How you gonna know me when I don't know me
I try to get to know myself
Self knowledge and tell myself
They're all gonna laugh at me....
I gotta get my head together

[Esham]
I gotta get my head straight, I'm losin my mind
Givin you a piece of my mind
I got somethin on my mind one time
But heyyy nevermind
I'm losin my sense, I got no sense
No nonsense, mo dollas than cents
Since I'm dyin
The world may never know if I'm lyin
Lyin in my grave
Heyyyy... I think I need a shave
What's my name ? Who stole my brain ? Who should I blame ?
Blame it on the boogie, blame it on the rain
I can feel yo pain
I'ma say, heyyyy I forgot what I'ma say
Who, what, when, where, why, how ?
I gotta get my head together

[Esham]
I got to get it straight, I got to get it straight
I can't really wait, I can't really wait
For my mind, making my mind, I'm losing my mind
So do you mind, I don't mind if you don't mind
Cause what's yours is mine
But I need my own
You know what I'm sayin holmes
You don't know cause I don't know
So get that my names Esham
Slit your wrist, drink a orange juice
Hallelujah
Suck my dick, what's it to ya
I'm from nowhere, I comin straight outta nowhere
And going nowhere
Mo dope, mo dope, mo coke for the fiends to smoke
Hit me, come get me lock me up
I don't give a fuck
I gotta get my head together

[Esham]
Man I'm back, I'm the black devil and that ain't no joke
What's up, who's playin that beat
Comin thru in the backseat
Cheap shots,cheap tricks
But you can suck on my toe hey hoe you know
That I'm the black bro
I still don't know where I come from
Lick my balls till my dick's numb
Dum diddy dum diddy dum dum
Redrum, I feel like a redrum
E-S-H-A-M
Why I'm talkin bout him ?
Is that me ? 
You can't see what I can see
Man whateva
I gotta get my head together</pre>
