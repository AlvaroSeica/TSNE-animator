[Immortal Technique]
The fuck is goin on~? Yeah yeah, yeah, uhh
Imagine the word of God without religious groupies
Imagine a saviour, born in a Mexican hooptie
Persecuted single mother in a modern manger
You'd crucify him again, like a fuckin stranger
Tears of the anger are worth more than diamonds or rubues
Imagine bein locked up since juvey
Imagine changin your life and still goin out like Tookie
Imagine biggaz talkin shit when they never knew me
Imagine a movie, that depicted the pain in your life
like them kids in Afghanistan, chasin the kite
For most of the world, that's what it's like
Imagine if the woman you supposed to love for the rest of your life
is set to marry someone else at the end of the night
They say you fight the greatest Jihad in your heart and your mind
and fight the hardest when you start from behind
So I dream the impossible, all the time
Fuck a masonic design, America's future is mine
Repeat that to yourself, cause if culture's a crime
then numbers tatted on your arm, aren't too far behind
They can only conquer you after they murdered your mind
So rise up, motherfucker like the sign of the times
I feel my body weakening, but my spirit is fine
Ready to go to war with Devils at the drop of a dime (c'mon~!)
and fight with my rebel army, until the stars are aligned

[Chorus: chant by Lockjaw Nakai, Cetan Wanbli until 2:20]

[Immortal Technique]
Nostradamus was a white man's prophet
who predicated European zupremacist logic
Because the pilgrims, and the conquistador columns
killed more innocent people than Hitler and Stalin (yes!)
I guess the fortune tellers skipped an anti-Christ or two
Brothers give this to the O.G.'s doin life with you
and pray for the problems, with the Pope psychology
so the Vatican will offer an apology (for what!?)
For destroying the people's liberation theology
Snatchin the spirit of Jesus from people in poverty
Business decisions, like keepin people in prison
but had the opposite effect, incarcerating religion
That type of crooked politics imposed on the populace
is obvious, if you read the Northwood Documents
Forget the compliments, for what I recorded (yeah)
and live for Revolution, instead of always dying for it!
Remember a bullet can never stop me (never!)
My legions are led by the spirit of Haile Selassie, watch me
Even if I'm shot in the chakra, I will prosper
Doppler effect, bumping music out a helicopter
Telling the Persians "Dig up Zoroastra"
And Tell them I came back, as the son of Ahura MazdÄ
Fish out the Philistine, Dagon, from the shores of Gaza
And call Quetzalcoatl, flying over La Raza
This is my message to the older Gods
I sacrifice you all, to the revolution like the Romanovs
Lost in the desert, like the Hebrews of Israel
The blood clot system, tryiedto kill me like sickle cell
But I survived and I'm alive to fight another day
Cocooned in a coma, I can still hear my mother pray
Sister crying out to God, "Please let my brother stay!"
Walking towards the light, but something's pulling me the other way

[Outro: Dr. Cornel West]
Immortal Technique, rise up young brother!
It is not your time to die... {*deep breath*}</pre>
