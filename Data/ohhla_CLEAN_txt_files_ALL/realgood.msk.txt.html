[Chorus]
I bet you fuck real good
Why don't you show me
You got my body feeling horny
I bet you fuck real good
Why don't you show me
This baby doll is getting lonely

[Verse 1]
You got this hypnotized look
And I can't get my mind out the gutter
I wanna fuck until tomorrow
You gave me a taste
So now I wanna check it out
On the bed, in the carro
Fuck that shit hasta en el ground
Cause
Chale I know you my man
But you don't understnad
That's how you got me
See you needa learn quick
I obsessed with your dick
And every time I see you I wanna take a
Don't fucking judge me
I am crazy
Rememberi'ma your lady
Estoy loca porti
Mas bien that shit belongs to me
So why you trippin carbon
Bring that shit over here
And let me show you boy
How a bitch suppose to feel

[Chorus: x2]
I bet you fuck real good
Why don't you show me
You got my body feeling horny
I bet you fuck real good
Why don't you show me
This baby doll is getting lonely

[Verse 2]
I bet you fuck real good
Is what I thought when I first saw you
"Mira" "Mira" I knew I was right about you
You just had the mice
That's why I wasn't surprised
When you pulled down your pants
And I saw what was inside
You a freak babe te amo
Shit I would never leave you
The way that you do what you do
Should be illegal
If we could just smash over this
Estadia devino
How many times?
Don't even ask babe</pre>
