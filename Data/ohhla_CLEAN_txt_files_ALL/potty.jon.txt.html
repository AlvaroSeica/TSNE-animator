Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hello boys and girls
itÂ’s time to learn about potty time
Do you feel a ca ca in your bum-bum
or a pee-pee in your wee-wee?
Well, come along and sing with me...

Poo-poo comes out of your bum
and it makes funny noises...
[farting noises]

Poo poo comes out of your bum
but you should do it in the toilet
And if you have to do a pee pee
do it in the potty...
peeing in your pants is really really naughty

This applies to some old people too</pre>
