Yeah, Ok

Ya'll ride the beat
I'm a bout to pop a wheelie bitch
Really dis, I came up with on some silly shit
Look how good it is
I'll show you who you dealin with
Ya'll illy, I'm Illa, I'm from Illinois
The big shine, why don't you call yo chi town boys
Show me where they at
I will destroy
I'm bout to fuck somethin up
I might as well call the lawyer
Good music run this bitch
Yes we do
I know you thinkin "damn I wish Ye would bless me too"
In the booth I use the restroom
It's best you, Go ahead and kiss the Jesus piece Cause I just blessed you
Uhh, And holy water odds against Ye
It's slaughter ever since I opened up that midnight merrauder?
Now it's gon be a problem like a brand new installment from the late great Mr. Christohper Wallace
They call us pompus
Can I be honest? Honestly, Modesty wouldn't ever end my policy
Apology accepted, you ain't say it? Shoulda said it
As soon as I did, all the Bullshit was deaded
Get it?

[Big Sean]
Yup, Yup I get it
Good music bitch, Ain't nobody fuckin with it
And Nah, nah they can't really do it how we did it
It's good music bitch, Ain't nobody fuckin with it

I know us niggas prayin um down fallin weak shit
But I'm never goin down hill
Even on ski trips

Come and make an observation
And it seem like the murder rate is higher than the population
Damn, I bet you just as sweet as you look bitch

Good music man Ye where he find me at

Big business, respect my conglomerance
Girls get check, but my bank get check more
Whenever niggas check up, I'm who they check for, or have a check for
Loui V shit so much domnier print fuck around and play check-ors
And these rappers get critical damages, But I rap so good it's no need for bandages
You the man in your city, Cool
When I'm out performin? right after you
I'm sorry but you gone be ranked right afta two
Cause I'm first place
And second is my crew
So move, Bitch</pre>
