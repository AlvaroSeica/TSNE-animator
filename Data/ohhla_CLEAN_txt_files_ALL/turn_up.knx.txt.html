[Intro: Nas]
I only fuck with my niggas I keep it tight
With my big brother, Bumpy Knuckles
We 'gon ride on these niggas my nigga

[Chorus: Nas] (DJ Premier Scratchin)
Turn up the mics! Yeah! Let's get crazy! Nigga! What!
Turn up the mics! Y'all bitch ass niggas is Schwayze!
Check it out! (C-C-COME ON!!!)

[Verse One: Nas]
I'm nasty, but fuck bitches, handcuff snitches
Feed they, nuts to pitbulls that plan more business
Got sluts on leashes walkin on all fours 
Have them eatin from dog bowls pettin their heads
'Cause they love playin that roll they sexy in bed
Smokin bud I'm out of control wish deaf on the feds
Cups spills with Grey Goose, watching snuff films
Laughin at dykes that wear patten leather with spikes 
My cheddar is right Miami Beach playin it low
St. Barts rented house and a boat, two hundred thou on my throat
That's only half of what my wife ice cost
Phone call hearin, another boss got his life lost
Well, wipn sand off of my toes 
Read a book called Catcher In The Rye I chose
Some Bob Marley then apply to the scheme 
To make me and Bump Knucks more rich, then I got me a team
He got him a team, we tryin to buy, G4's with missle launchers
Tired of walkin 'round with beef, with our pistols on us
C4's better I'm callin me some B-more killers
To come and bleed you, show us the suns and the sky
Your surely die, you washed up fuck your people!
Your money ain't as long as mine you dumb and you foul
Who you tryin to squeeze old as fuck with alzheimer's disease
We the new breed......nigga!!!

[Chorus: Nas &amp; Bumpy Knuckles] (DJ Premier scratchin) (*Nas) (**Bumpy Knuckles)
Turn up the mics!!! (T-T-T-Talk about it be about it-"Havoc") (*Holla at somebody real) 
Turn out the lights!!! (**Uh huh) (*Bumpy Knuckles, God Son, get right motherfuckers!!!)
Turn up the mics!!! (T-T-T-Talk about it be about it-"Havoc") (**Turn the motherfuckers up!!!)
Turn out the lights!!! (**That's right, y'all know why?!) (*SUICIDE! SUICIDE!)

[Verse Two: Bumpy Knuckles]
It's Bump, I'm rowdy I'm wild I'm crazy I'm slick
I talk shit, name brand bitches all on my dick
I don't trip, I meet bitches in this game that got pretty famous
Games all that's project pussy nigga it's all the same 
We gangstas! We keep it hardcore keep it atreet
Keep the guns and microphones be keep it heap
I'm the unsquashable beef, I put it in your rider
That means that every show, I'll be layin in your dressing room
Next to the Henny rock, two times twenty cocked
I'm a cold ass nigga, that keep shit plenty hot
My bubble goose is stocked with double truth
For you old ass gangstas and you troubled youth
Know it! I hate cops and niggas with cops friends
That still buy weight in the hood, they drop in
With little marks on 'em, scratched by the eye
You hand me a twenty, you must wanna die!
Nigga! I won't remake a 'Pac record or say a Biggie verse
And I'll shoot you without smokin a Ziggy Marley first
God Son we hot in here!!!
Bravehearts we hot in here niggas they got to fear!

[Chorus: Nas]
Turn up the mics! Yeah! Let's get crazy! Nigga! What!
Turn up the! Y'all bitch ass niggas is Schwayze!
Check it out! Turn up the mics! Yeah! Let's get crazy! Nigga! What!
Turn up the mics! Y'all bitch ass niggas is Schwayze! 
Check it out!
