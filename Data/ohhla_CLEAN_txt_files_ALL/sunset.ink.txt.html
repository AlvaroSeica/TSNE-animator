Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Now, just picture me - high up with my top down
On Highland and Sunset, doin' 85 on the top deck
See, step by step we're walking on stars
If you're looking for some action, you ain't gotta go that far

[Chorus]
Now, just picture me Hollywood living
Riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now, stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down
Man, you know how it go down
Man, you know how it go down
Highland entertainer, waiting 'til the sun goes down
You know how it go down
You know how it go down
Might get a little crazy, just wait until the sun goes down

[Verse 1]
Underground, any city I come in town
Touchdown, Hail Mary, gettin' to the dough like Pillsbury
All night, don't feel worried
High up is where we will be
Nah, you ain't gotta feel guilty
Won't judge you, go on, be free
So pour what you want
Go head, roll what you want
Fuck what they say
Somebody walkin' 'round here like they're somebody
Don't know what kind of day I had
With all this weight, couldn't hold my bag
Don't hold me back from my habits
Live a fast life for the magic
I'm just lookin' 'round for the baddest
Hollywood face with an ass from Dallas
Big-ass crib, nigga livin' in a palace
We rollin' out
And my hands on the wheel so tight, got a callus
Get so fabulous
With everybody here, only thing that matters

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And it's go time
I swear this feeling's like we're inches from the goal line
Now or never, better make your mind
Might hit her with a line like "what's your sign?"
Hit her with a glass of sparkling wine
Hit her on the ass, she might not mind
Actin' like a 10, look more like a 9, but
Don't be stuck up
Really, how could you not see us
Doing it big, it's obvious
You ain't gotta say much, 'cause
I know you're sick and tired, sick and tired of all that bullshit
Then don't be afraid, take a shot and bite the bullet
That's one in the hole
Can't get enough, need one or two more
Tell 'em catch up, they're running to slow
Out the gutter, I learned to bowl
And finally it's movie time to show them I play the role
Of a champion, you see the goal
Light shines bright, can't see the road...

[Chorus]</pre>
