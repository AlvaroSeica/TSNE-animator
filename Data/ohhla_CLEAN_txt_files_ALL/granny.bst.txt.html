[Adrock]
Yeah, ah yeah, aw yeah
This one's dedicated to all the ladies in the front, the back
All my older ladies out there, lookin nice, you know who you are
Whew!

I need you, boomin granny, I said
I want you, boomin granny

(Chorus)
Boomin granny, boomin fanny
Boomin granny, good and plenty

[Mike D]
Well it might sound odd it might sound corny
But here's some sex rhymes for those that are horny
For your boomin granny with the boomin sisters
Said I love ya won't leave ya, till ya gotta listen
I'm talkin about the way that I'm feeling
Here's a lovely lady and so appealing
A sassy, sophisticated, sexy lady
Well I'm twenty six, and you're eighty
The clock is ticking so you better not front
We can go to my place and we can smoke a blunt
Well you're a Golden Girl, just like P.R.
Just turn down the lights so we can go far

(Chorus)

[Adrock]
Because I saw you at the checkout line
You dropped your coupons and you were lookin fine
Sophisticated, and so mature
I couldn't really care if you're fifty, or seventy four
Because I wantcha, and I need ya
Hey boomin granny you could be my teacher
And I could be ya pet, bet
Listen old lady I could make ya sweat
I know I'm younger, and your much older
You look so nice on my Chevy Nova
I'ma take you to the low rider show, and flauntcha
I gotta tell ya lady I said I wantcha, boomin granny
Because I need you, boomin granny

(Chorus)</pre>
