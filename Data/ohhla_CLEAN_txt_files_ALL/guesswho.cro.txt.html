[Intro: Snoop]
Guess who's back, back? Crooked I~!
What's really hood? Big Snoop Dogg
I got my nephew in the house right about now
Check this shit out right here cuz

[Chorus One: Crooked I + Snoop Dogg]
Guess who's back in the motherfuckin house?
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth
Hoes recognize, niggaz do too
Hoes recognize, and niggaz do too

[Crooked I]
Guess who's back and I'm workin on the clock - say bro
It's Crooked I, got 'em jerkin on the block - they know
The coupe Prego, convertible the top - aiyyo
Your goons lay low, I murder with a glock - fatal
I'd rather fuck with some bitches
But these haters love drama, guess it comes with the riches
And all my thugs with the business
In the club wit'cha misses, love the hugs and the kisses (muah!)
My rap money in my right hand (get 'em)
My trap money in my left hand (get 'em)
Live my life in front of a mic stand
You can get married to crime, I'll be the best man
I'm in and out of the game
Proud of the power that came, you cowards out of your brain
Uhh, Scram Jones is bringin the speaker crack out
Stop the beat, Long Beach! Bring it back now

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: all together]
Guess who's back in the motherfuckin house?
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth
Hoes recognize, niggaz do too
Hoes recognize, and niggaz do too

[Crooked I]
Yeah, hoes recognize, niggaz do too - really
A few - milli; the boy hustle too silly
And new giddy{?}, some real dudes move with me
Goon city, Bad Boy, new Diddy
Rrrah! Rrrah! What the bloodclaat?
I wanna see that ass poppin when the drums drop
Rrrah! Rrrah! Keep your guns cocked
My Cali niggaz smokin kush 'til they lungs stop (ahhhh)
Illegal money in my right hand (get 'em)
But legal money in my left hand (get 'em)
Look at the ice on my hype man
That's C.O.B., we at the check stand (oww)
And tell the fans eat a dick
My grind is sick wit it, I'm just tryin to be legit (be legit)
I'm a rider, I'm the kind you need to get
I'm the guy to lead the ship, I'm just tryin to be the shit!

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Crooked I]
Guess who's back in the motherfuckin house illin?
A wild villain, fresh to death, my style killin
Drought fillin, new Ferrari without ceilin
Your spouse willin, my dick's in her mouth chillin
You're now fuckin with the braveheart
When you hear (pow pow) that's my trademark
I gotta get it for my homies in the graveyard
I hear 'em yellin "Crook, you better hit the game hard" (hard)
Label money in my right hand (get 'em)
Under-the-table money in my left hand (get 'em)
Build a small fortune with my grind man
But Rubin and Simmons was smarter cause they built Def Jam!
Inspire me to take bigger steps
Fans rather see me shoot guns on the internet
Rappers beefin in public, where's your intellect?
Talkin 'bout killin each other, why you ain't did it yet?

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Interlude: Camille - repeat 2X]
Guess who's back in the motherfuckin house?
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin mouth
Hoes recognize, niggaz do too
Hoes recognize, niggaz do too

[Snoop Dogg - during Interlude]
C'mon, Crooked I, gangsta shit
Eastside Long Beach nigga
Yeah niggaz do too...
Guess who's back? Crooked I~!</pre>
