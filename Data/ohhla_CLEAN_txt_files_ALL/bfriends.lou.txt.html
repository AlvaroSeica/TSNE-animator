[Louis Logic]
Oh Ap I'm glad I caught you, you know I'm Â‘bout to leave the pad on tour soon
And I thought you'd watch my lady while I'm gone dude

[Apathy]
Yo c'mon Lou, of course that's cool, your my fucken man
My fam, I mean damn, I don't got no other plans
We can rent some blockbuster, catch a movie or two
Yo but imma have to leave her home if there's some hoochie to screw

[Louis Logic]
Oh shit yeah, if there's some booty for you, handle yours, hit the bed
I aint tryna cock block if ya gettin head
Lick and spread that chick instead, but if not, you gotta watch my baby then
Cause most of my lady's friends are chickenheads

[Apathy]
Yeah that's understandable, broads can be real influential
And keeping a clean slate is instrumental in relationships potential
I'll run into the store for the doe if shes low
And try to keep her from runnin with clubbin hoes

[Louis Logic]
Word, I new there was a reason you're my brother yo

[Apathy]
Of course Lou, your blood from another mother, no other bro

*Phone ringing*

[Apathy]
Hello

[Louis Logic]
Aiiyo Ap, wassup its Lou
My bus is stuck in ?, I'm glad I trust you to watch my lovely boo
Aiiyo, y'all found some stuff to do

[Apathy]
Oh word up, we just buggin dude
Tryna watch this flick, wanna talk to your chick?
Oh, hold up, she just went into the bathroom sick
See we was drinkin and shit and now we chillin on the couch
We was thinking of goin out but decided to lounge in the house


[Louis Logic]
Yo, lounge in the house? Bounce and be out?
What you mean shes sick, yo who the fuck you think you drinkin with
Your supposed to be over seeing shit
It sounds like all hell's breakin loose

[Apathy]
Yo, your breakin up Lou and your trippin like I'm trickin with your chick
Stop bein a dick actin like we fiendin to stick -phone hanging up-

-phone ringing-

[Apathy]
Yo fuck it, don't pick it up, Lou's just bein a jerk
His goin berserk, his probably just stressed from all the work
Lets relax, sure we can cuddle, there's nothin wrong with that
You can lay across the couch and put your head on my lap

-knock on door-

[Apathy]
Oh, what up b

[Louis Logic]
Don't what up me you fuckin asshole
I dropped outta my tour and had to duck my last show
Whats goin on with you and my girl, slutty asshole
You fuckin her? What you tryna ruin my world!?

[Apathy]
Yo first of all kid! Take that fuckin tone out your voice
We boys but what you girl does is really her choice
Now she's sittin lonely at home while your doin your shows
Besides son, I thought it was bros before hoes

[Louis Logic]
So if your clothes come off while your chillin with my sweet thing
I'm supposed to let her share her g-string!?
Imma take that anniversary ring right back to Zales
Ask the sales girl to take back the pearls!
Smack the curls off my ladies head and kill you for your treachery
You said you were my best friend, instead you got the best of me

[Apathy]
Yo Lou, this shit is hectic B, I'm really not the enemy
It takes two to tango and we share the same energy
One night over some Hennessey we started messin sexually
And well, now we dealin with an unexpected pregnancy
