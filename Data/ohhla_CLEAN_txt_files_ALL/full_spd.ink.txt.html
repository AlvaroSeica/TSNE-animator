[Chorus]
I'm ridin' 'round with the windows up
Doin' a hundred on the dashboard
Feelin' like can't nobody catch me
Headed to the top, baby, full speed
I said you might need a telescope
If you tryna see where we goin'
Feelin' like can't nobody catch me
Headed to the top, baby, full speed

[Verse 1]
I said can't nobody catch up, I ain't tryna come off cocky
This is more of a confession how we made it through the struggle
Had a bunch of learning lessons, I ain't never buy the phone
But I hope you get the message, I'm
Lookin' left and right, hoping everything pans out
Always had my foot in, never had no handouts
See, I work for everything, married to the game, no wedding ring
You can tell 'em we made it here at last like
Yeah  shine brighter than ever before
See the light gold drippin' like a waterfall
We movin' at a steady flow
Roll  just let me know when you ready to go

[Chorus]
I'm ridin' 'round with the windows up
Doin' a hundred on the dashboard
Feelin' like can't nobody catch me
Headed to the top, baby, full speed
I said you might need a telescope
If you tryna see where we goin'
Feelin' like can't nobody catch me
Headed to the top, baby, full speed

[Verse 2]
I said can't nobody stop me
Flame on, got to burn it down in the hot seat
Never slowin' up with the windows shut
No wind, just AC, wish somebody would race me
Out of here, hop in and we adios
Who winning, it's obvious
Them other dudes ain't even close
I can show you things, show you things you ain't even know
Speedin' down the fast lane, I don't know what it mean to coast
Now I'm higher than ever before
In the clouds, lookin' for the star of the show
We movin' at a steady flow
Roll  just let me know when you ready to go

[Chorus]
I'm ridin' 'round with the windows up
Doin' a hundred on the dashboard
Feelin' like can't nobody catch me
Headed to the top, baby, full speed
I said you might need a telescope
If you tryna see where we goin'
Feelin' like can't nobody catch me
Headed to the top, baby, full speed</pre>
