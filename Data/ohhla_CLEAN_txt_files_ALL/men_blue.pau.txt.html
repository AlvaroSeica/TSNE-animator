"Give me some time to blow the men down"

You have the right to remain silent. Anything 
you say can and will be twisted around and used 
against you in the court of law, I'll make damn 
fuckin' sure of it! You have the right to an attorney
If you cannot afford an attorney, which 
you probably can, we will be provided for you 
you stupid, freakin', moulanan bastard!

		"Blow the men down"

 [Officer O'Maley Bitchkowski / Everlast]
It's the bad lieutenant, runnin up in your tenament
plantin' evidence on any black resident
New York's largest crew, it's the Men in Blue
we stick together like glue and make lies come true
my name's Officer O'Maley, I shoot you in the alley
and burn you like a cross at a fuckin' clan rally
I got spics sellin' nicks in the LES
I stay untouchable like my name's Eliot Ness  
New York's finest, with a bullet-proof vest
I confiscate the chronic, I let you keep the stress
that is unless you wanna try and test
I'm D.T. undercover,  I lock up your mother
you're just another brother, you ain't the mafia don
who the fuck's payroll do you think that I'm on? 

" The Police Department is like a crew
it does whatever it wants to do
the Police Department, we're like a crew
we do whatever we want to do!
The Police Department, it's like a crew
it does whatever it wants to do
the Police Department, it's like a crew
it does whatever it wants to do!"

 [Officer O'Maley Bitchkowski / Everlast]
You know this ain't Serpico and you ain't Al P.
I got it locked from Hunter's Point in the Square in AL B.
From the Bronx to Queens to Brooklyn to Staten
we're the most organized criminals in Manhattan
When we come, we swarm in full uniform
when the blue lights flash stop runnin' your cash
It goes back to the days of Al Caponal and Frank Nitty
illegal business controls the city - oh what a pity
if your attitudes shity, fuck my money up kiddin 
you'll be doin' this bit - if you spill what I did
I'll pull a pill in your lid
don't get you bustin like a cherry waitin' in the comissery

	Ahh, what's this?! Crack!? Is that a gun!?
	You stupid moule fuck! 
	You're gonna be doin' some real time son!

" The Police Department is like a crew
it does whatever it wants to do
the Police Department, we're like a crew
we do whatever we want to do!"

 [Officer O'Maley Bitchkowski / Everlast]
I raid stairways in the PJs just for thrills
and pull triggers on niggaz that won't hurt the crills
it's brought up to paper, punk that's the caper
if we make this connection, I'll give you protection
In this year the mayor's up for reelection
so rat out all the competition in your section
In the next day, there will be a drug sweep around your way
so let your crew know, it's time to stay low
keep up in the dough and you get the info 
on what's goin down and we can run this town
straight into the ground, while we rise to the top
there ain't no such thing as a dirty cop
cause I plant what I want on any crime scene
I keep my hands clean, you know what I mean

" The Police Department is like a crew
it does whatever it wants to do
the Police Department, we're like a crew
we do whatever we want to do!
The Police Department, it's like a crew
it does whatever it wants to do
the Police Department, it's like a crew..."
