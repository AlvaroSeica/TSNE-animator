[Intro]
Y'know, when I was a kid growing up
We used to love playing outside, riding bikes
That was the 80's, record heatwaves
I mean people were like, dying on the side of the road getting heatstroke
So the only thing you could do... was go in the house and, y'know
Take a shower a couple of times a day
So... I'll never forget I was like seven years old {*shower noises*}
I closed my eyes, and that's when it started
I started seeing sounds
WHOA~!

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Time for some action

[Pharrell]
Yeah, you know the scenario
Images circle your mind like a merry-go
If you just tunin into your stereo
Turn this bitch up, here we go

[Chorus]

[Shay]
I'm more like a vulture, far from a dove
Don't you mistake this ma, this is not love
It's lust; no cuddles and hugs
This is for floor and rugs

[Chorus]

[Pharrell]
Yo, the sweat on your body it creates a scent
No liquor no pills only that's gets me bent
I'm loving your clothes especially the prints
Get it, the prints

[Chorus]

[Shay]
Hey, you ain't know I was a nasty guy
You say you wanna flash me right?
You know only I could smash you right
Well alright!

[Chorus]

[Pharrell - singing]
It's time for some action
What can you imaaaagine?
Its time for some action
What can you imaaaagine?
Whoa, whoa, whoa (ACTION!)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (ACTION!)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (ACTION!)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (ACTION!)

{*schoolbell rings*}

[Interlude]
I see what's going on
I've been sitting there all along
Just waiting and waiting cause I'm tired

[Chorus] - 1/2

[Outro]
I ain't got nothin to say, nothin to do
But I've been waiting for so long, and I think I think I think I'm through

[Chorus]</pre>
