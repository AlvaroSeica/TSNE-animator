 (Aight)

[Murs]
I'm a convict
of a racist crime
And I've only served
19 years of my time

I'M SORRY! For something that I didn't do
I killed somebody, and I don't know who
You blame me for slavery
A hundred years before I was BORN!!

I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!

I'M SORRY! For something that I didn't do
I killed somebody, and I don't know who
You blame me for slavery
A hundred years before I was BORN!!

I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!

I'm a convict
of a racist crime
And I've only served
19 years of my time

SORRY~! For something that I didn't do
I killed somebody, and I don't know who
You blame me for slavery
A hundred years before I was BORN!

I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being WHITE!
I'm guilty of being a White Mandingo

I'm not doin it anymore, fuck that shit
I'ma bust a fuckin blood vessel</pre>
