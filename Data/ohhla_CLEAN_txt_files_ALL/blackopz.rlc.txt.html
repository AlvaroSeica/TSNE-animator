[ INTRO: Reef the Lost Cauze* ]
Helicopers hover heavily above
often not higher than the treetops that dot the battle field
Staccato vibrations of automatic gunfire crack throughout the night
drowned out only by explosions and sirens
People hustle quickly past
in a dangerous attempt to get anywhere the fighting happens to be heaviest
There is troop movement throughout the cities
and n some areas the fighting is intense
These soldiers are engaged in a civil war
A war without terms
A war fought by any means necessary
with anything at their disposal
This conflict has lasted decades longer than Vietnam
And though the setting is not a jungle per se
its atmosphere is as dangerous and mysterious as any jungle in the world

[ CHORUS 2X ]
This is Black Opz, I ain't talk about Xbox
This is war with drugs and gangs and black cops
Watch your back or end up with your back shot
In Philly it feel like we playin a game of Black Opz

[ VERSE 1 ]
Gunshots burstin, hear the fear in your enemies' curses
Many things are not guaranteed, but death is certain
In the bushes in all-black is an insurgent
Strapped with a bomb to his person waitin to hurt shit
The street level surface is filled with workers ( ? )
Trained in the weapons of torture
And the oppressed just live with it
It sound like Iraq or maybe a Palestinian village
But if you change just a few details you see hell
It's in the same streets that we dwell
Where they hardly spar, they get their auntie's car
Mask on like Mardi Gras and leave you harshly scarred
It is God we call but when there's no answer it's arms we draw
Hear the howls from the dogs of war
This the place where you meet death
You can't stop the game, there's no reset

[ CHORUS 2X ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Revolution in the hour of black steel, rats filled
With the plague, attack from the black hills
Stormin the bastille with a bat to smack grills
Sellin sex, death, guns, crack, pills, your last meal
All that's up for grabs
Cops with batons got they foot all up your ass
Hear the blast when that thing crash up the ave
It's just a game, no winners, we all come in last
Helicopters in the hood remind us hell's upon us
The light shines on the manhunt, the hood Osamas
And they baby mamas hidin hopin they don't find 'em
But the black Black Opz swarmed on 'em like piranhas
There's no glory to be found, no honor
Kill or be killed or beg for mercy from Your Honor
It's sad, fam, but the facts stand
It ain't too different for an American blackman or a brother who's Afghan

[ CHORUS 2X ]

[ OUTRO: Reef the Lost Cauze* ]
The war has been raging on for centuries
The death toll is in the thousands
The wounded unaccountable and missing-in-action is an unthinkable number
But see, no one is keeping a tally
And no one has noticed except for those involved in the fighting
and those directly drawn in by geographical location, economic status or family association
Other than that the war has been kept from the world
hidden like an ugly scar across the belly of an otherwise beautiful woman
Under the guise of being a showpiece for the world
where prosperity is as found easily as water in a stream
America, for all her beauty, has an ugly scar across her belly
that she has tried repeatedly to supress and keep hidden from curious onlookers
More than a few times she's almost been exposed, and this ugliness brought to light
but always another garment would quickly be thrown over the rough spot
and all the turmoil and ugliness would again again blanketed
But not this time
