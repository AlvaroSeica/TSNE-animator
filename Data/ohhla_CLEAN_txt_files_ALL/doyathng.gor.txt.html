[2D]
I'm a bad imitator of a boy in the sky
with a cap in his head, and a knot in his tie
I'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
The shadow in the corner, is playin along
I'm only laying in my bed, I'm rollin aside
But if I get a car, uh, a moment to ride
Because I know if I ever shared a livin of you
You've got a, and you don't know what to do
You stop

[Chorus: James Murphy]
You will not do it, but you don't know what you're doin baby
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-uh... 
You wanna feel it, but you don't know what you're feeling tonight 
(Alright, how are we doin?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking baby 
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-uh... 
You do more thinking and I'm goin out and make it alright
(Oh no, how do you do?)

[2D]
I'm impregnable, incredible, the setting of quo
I'm a late Jimi writer, not a "Heart and Soul"
I got a Saturday night, of nothing instead
Ah, if I ever had to do it, well, you know I wouldnt care
I just make down, I love when Im seen
Yeah, and if I'm on a tour back, the message is free
Then theres a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
And if you can't party, you get em a lot
You get a high, bass..

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Andre 3000]
Everytime we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just nor-mal peo-ple? 
Yeah, trying so hard to act like we don't care
But it's true you do, nothing is left
So I guess I'm right

[Andre 3000]
New word, onomatopoeia (boom)
Quit actin like you don't wanna be here
Fuck around and get jumped like leap year
Glock in the club make you really wanna leave me a-
lone, get the fuck on, gone
Okay okay okay, back to the happy song
Rap ain't nothin but the art of talkin shit
My gurl look pretty up there ridin dick
My plaid past, my solid future
Astronaut ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an +OutKast+ but you're into me
Summer got mad cause the winter blew me
That Juicy Fruit, that splooshy sploosh
Generation X on bloopty bloop
Get duked gotta get duke-a-duked
Err'body hit floor, we thru the roof, hah~!
Like a chimney, I commend me
How come it be, some lame-ass nigga 
talkin about, "Ah, he don't rap enough"
But y'all +Rap-A-Lot+ and I'm like wrap it up, hoe
Yee ain't Scarface, yee ain't Willie D
Yee ain't Bushwick, yee ain't killin me
Betta +Play Witcha Muh'fuckin Mama+
Betcha still stay witcha muh'fuckin mama
Keep sleepin on me, I'ma rock my pajamas
In the daytime, I swear, I promise
Dare a nigga say somethin, tear a nigga face off
How come blacks don't play baseball?
Y'all bite, know y'all can taste 
all this fly shit, I stay finna to take off
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Yee ain't fresh-squeezed juice, nigga you that Tang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Wait, is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane
Uh, bet it up, header-ups
A lava language in a vocal volcanic (yea)
If it ain't fixed, don't broke it, don't panic (yea)
If it ain't this, it ain't shit, God-damn it (yea)
If it ain't this, it ain't dope, it don't flush 
If it ain't hip, it don't hop, well then hush 
Man they sound like, man they stole your, man they look like 
Nope, it ain't us
Ah, do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Do ya damn thang, do ya thang-a-thang
Yee ain't fresh-squeezed juice, nigga {YOU DAT TANG}

[Bridge: Andre 3000]
Everytime we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just nor-mal peo-ple? 
Yeah, trying so hard to act like we don't care... I don't care
But it's true you do, nothing is left
So I guess I'm right
Fifty page, our days are revelatious, haaaaaa!
Space is +Strange+, +Doctor+ I've got no patience/patients!
Oh it's all a part of the process, okay okay
Nothings new it's true, cool I admit
Shit, I guess you're right

...Asshole

{song stops with chants in the background}

Sometime I feel like the shit, sometime I feel like I'm shit
Sometime I wanna stand for somethin, then sometime wanna sit
Didn't really plan on cussin but sometime it just slip
When you the mayonnaise and the mustard, you cain't relish in it
And when them panties turn to custard, who the hell do they miss?
And when the nanny fucks the husband, what does she tell the kids?
That's a whole 'nother discussion we cain't fit in our kicks
That's a whole 'nother discussion, you cain't fit in these kicks
Yeah...
Mmm, the way I feel tonight 
I think I'll wear these shades for the, rest of my life
Yeah... Yeah.
The way I feel tonight, I think I'll wear these shades for the, rest of my life
The way I feel tonight, I think I'ma wear these shades for the rest of my life
That way, you won't be able to see the disappointment in my eyes
Cause they don't lie (don't lie...), not to my eyes (not to my eyes...)
Nah, they don't lie (they don't lie...), not to my eyes (not to my eyes...) um-um...
They don't lie (they don't lie...) 
Not to my eyes (my eyes...)
Not to my eyes (my eyes...)
Not to my eyes (not to my eyes...)
Not to my eyes (not to my eyes...)
