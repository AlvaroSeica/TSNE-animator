Typed by: vegetacarter@yahoo.com

Def Jam! uh..
Cap Hill yaow...Big Sauks
Gilla House

[Chorus]
This is something for the streets to rock to
Get your weight up, dedicated to all haters
That's right...This is something for the streets to rock to
Niggaz get your weight up, dedicated to all haters

[Verse 1]
Yoaw...And floss fakers
you in the presence of one of the greatest, Toronto be itching to place this
Sauks kissed your face, 92 give me ratings
Spins...like I sold my soul to Satan
You about to feel the don's creation
Pimping, never slipping on your radio station, ma
Shake your ass, you getting impatient, ma
My record's delayed, I feel your frustration, yeah
Saukrates, the hottest to trot since
College air-play was T.O.'s only option
When I was sixteen getting my first props and
The world was eagerly watching me, raising stocks man
The Circle's back
Kardinal Offishall, Choclair, Ro Ro D, Jully Black
My man Solitaire, Y-Look, and Tara
Chase and Marvel will hit you with the ??? tomorrow

[Chorus]
Oh no! It's something for the streets to rock to
Nigga get your weight up, dedicated to all haters, uh

[Verse 2]
Face this, a Big Black Lincoln cruising
Through your hood with the lights low, bringing the bruising
We teamed up with IRS, and Brassmunk
Me and my dog Igal hit that nice for your trunk
Yes...Redman is my bredren and
Yes...You probably seen me with Methodman
It's Def Jam, what you thought was gon' happen
Got ten times worse when I started rapping
Just like when bullets get to clapping, it's hard to believe a
Brick wall hit your face, and scarred with amnesia
I'm Scarborough 'til I die, giving women the seizure
They see me on Kennedy Road rolling geeza
It's all to the good!

[Bridge]
Yes, I'm reppin' every hood (Let 'em know!)
Reagent Park, Jungle City throw your hands up
Rexdale, Jane &amp; Finch serious as cancer, Toronto bringing the answer like
Pick a dayyyy, you can die in a million one wayyyyyys
From the action, Saukrates don't playyyyy
It's Saukrates with that Gilla House
Funky for your radio, touche!

[Chorus]
This is something for the streets to rock to
Niggaz get your weight up, dedicated to all haters
Yes! Capitol Hill! This is something for the streets to rock to
Niggaz get your weight up, dedicated to all haters
Saukrates, give me my papers, man...</pre>
