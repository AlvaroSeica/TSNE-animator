Wake up, They looking for Hip and Hop to break up
And there's so many ways for me and you to get our cake up
Shake up the industry, Power to the people
Equal partnership, Yeah, That's what interests me
Incidentally you can't control what's pop'n in the hood
Stop the violence, Never saw you stopping in the hood
Break the silence, Cops be copping in the hood
Lawyers, Doctors, Copping in the hood, (Yeah)
They saw product is proper in the hood
Even criminal court judge's smock'n up the goods
Got the nerve to judge me, You's a hypocrite
Feeling guilty so you find me guilty, Hip to your shit
Sick the D's on us like you really give a fuck
You wanna cut, Untaxed though, We don't give a buck
Get these nuts, I'ma still stay tree'd up
Hitting these smuts on the block till I C-G's us

[Styx Sample 2X]
Don't be fooled by the, Radio

[Block McCloud]
Yo it's The Wake Up Show, A real dose of reality
It's syndicated too, Them other folks gone be mad at me
Cause they the pretenders that keep lies woven
Pull the wool over your eyes closing, Got your guys dozing
Got ya counting the wolf in sheep's clothing till you go to sleep
Brain washed by radio controlled freaks, It's like
Like what they like, Force fed, Your throat red
Swallowing the whole jam, Directed and programmed
It's like the dope man just keep feeding you garbage
After a while you fiending for garbage
And forgot like you just dreaming of hard shit
Keeping you starving, Don't even remember, (What)
Lost in their scheme'n agenda, Pathetic
Got you locked in like a three-pete offender
No rights, No votes, Forced to read and heed old quotes
You keep reciting that same rap dude, But that dude's rap food
Rhymes is reckless, Rise and shine it's time for breakfast, Wake Up

[Styx Sample 2X]
Don't be fooled by the, Radio

[Dr. Ama]
Hey Mr. D.J., Put that on replay
Take time, Listen close to what he and she say
Keep it real with us, Fuck what the F.C.C. say
Be wise selector, Go to Hell program director
Force feed use the lame shit, How lame can this game get
Some artists seem brainless, Should I remain nameless
The claim is this one's the best, The radio play'n him
Face to face, Face the facts, Doc A.M.A. slay'n em
I see the gay in em, Hip Hop decay in em
You spin it everyday, Got the fans obey'n em
That's word to me, You do it purposely
What could your purpose be, The crime
Slime get to shine the prime time play
I'm inclined to pull the thing, Let the nine spray
Evil thoughts, Should I do what my mind say
Or fall back and continue to let the blind stray
