Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Over and over again
I meet different guys who would play a part
But I need a homie, a lover, a friend
Somebody that's true and won't break my heart
Baby, oh maybe
I'll get a chance to see you, a chance to meet you
Oh baby, oh lately
It's been kind of lonely tell me where you are

[Chorus]
I gotta know, I wanna know
Where you are, baby I won't give up until I'm yours
You need to be, right here with me
I just wanna find my mystery lover
I gotta find you
Baby please tell me where you are
I need to see you
I gotta meet you
I need to be right where you are
Mystery lover

[Verse 2]
Too much time has passed by
Still so alone, here on my own
I need your mystery love
I need your heart and I wanna touch ya
Baby, oh maybe I'll get a chance to see you
A chance to meet you
Oh baby, oh lately
Been kinda lonely tell me where you are

[Chorus]

Is he a stranger
Is he a friend
Is he a star
Or a regular man
Could he be this person, that's been here in front of me this whole time

[Chorus]</pre>
