Song:   Who Killed Realness
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

[K-Rino]
I arrived at the scene of the crime and met with my committee
There was a thousand mile chalk line drawn around the whole city
It seemed like I would get the word before the world had heard it
I asked somebody what had happened? He said Realness had been murdered
I said damn, damn, damn, like Florida
Then I turned and asked the coroner 
What type of horrible person would go to war with her?
Sweet, innocent, quality like Realness
He paused and then revealed that... it coulda been killed by collective mental illness
He said Realness had been missing for years before it passed
Now that I think about it, it had been awhile since I saw it last
Do y'all have any suspects in mind?
He said we will once detectives find a timeline or a sign that connects to the crime
See since the dawn of time, this statement is a fact
That it suffered when men carried out any artificial act
And anytime somebody faked off a misrepresentative statement
That flagrant hatred went straight to the heart of real and forsakes it

(Chorus) Ashlei Mayadia
Who killed Realness is what we ask?
Searched all over to find out facts
I can't remember where I seen it last, damn
Nobody stepped up and took the blame
Asked for a witness but no one came
Since it been gon' life just ain't the same, damn

[K-Rino]
Now I searched around checking every dark location known
I couldn't wait; I had to do an investigation of my own
I moved hurriedly, the lack of concerns started to worry me
I found every lowlife I knew and interrogated 'em thoroughly
I was like where were you when Realness died; my mind was on the resting
After days I realized that there were too many people to question
I was baffled, so I knew I had to break it down to bit
If I can only figure out the last person that it was with
I met an old lady who told me she can help me with my search
She said she saw Realness debating with a Pastor after Church
Then she saw her leaving a motel with a woman who had a pistol
Later that night it was on TV sitting in DC with a government official
Apparently it showed up uninvited and a riot was incited
The next day I found out I was being indicted
I couldn't understand what the summon was about
But I guess on my court date I'll get a chance to find out

(Chorus) Ashlei Mayadia

[K-Rino]
When I got to court, the prosecution mentioned the life sentence
It was the first trial in history with five million defendants
To be convicted of murder, the whole public was subject
We was all guilty of it, even the judge who judged it
A thought came to me that day, is it insane for me to say
That a metaphysical quality can contain a DNA?
If not explain to me the way?
A whole population can dangerously display the same hate and simultaneously decay
Then a voice echoed through the wind and made the crowd react
It was a child; he said is there a way to bring back the Realness back?
What if everybody stopped lying and cheating and deceiving?
Started being honest even, maybe that would end the grieving
All at once a lot of chattering and bumping heads begun
Someone said it sounds good son, but it's easier said then done
The child said Realness was killed but it was you who killed 'em
But it will rise like Lazarus again inside the children

(Chorus) Ashlei Mayadia</pre>
