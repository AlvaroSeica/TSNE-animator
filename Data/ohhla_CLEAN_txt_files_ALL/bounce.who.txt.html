[Red Café]
Y'all make that bitch bounce like we hittin' the switch or somethin'

[Red Café w/ Juvenile harmonizing background]
MOVE! Bounce, now r-I-I-I-ide

Wash dirty money, wash dirty money

[Red Café]
They call me R to the E dot
I got dope wholesale, two weed spots
I got coke fish scaled that'll freeze blocks
I got hook up shit, already bagged up you don't even need pots
Just scream at me if you need some troops
That apply pressure squeeze the juice
And show you how to get your game tight
Keep your hoes in check
How to play your cards right like you know the deck
Keep two bitches, get incredible head from both faces
RC applied the decimal both places
Gangster, walk with a limp I'm paid sonny
I shake look dirty money drip from me
I got a bitch that'll walk the strip for me
Or strip for me, load clips or even fuck my bitch for me
I'm never slippin' without the gat by me
I take it from New York to Miami like Pat Riley

[Skip]
I got one house, three whips, one gun, three clips
Me work see Skip throw you for a quick flip
If you need a cheap brick, you can get a cheap brick
I'm talking three G's, three bricks, that's apiece shit
Butcha gotta follow me to Guatemala
I'ma let you meet Saddam and Mussolin' so you can holla
If you can follow, we gon' get two Impalas
with Jewish drivers so the FEDs be to stup' to follow
??? ???? ??? until we juice the collar
I'm tryin' to walk like I got jean tubs on
with the pockets knotted
And with my private spotted I'ma get that
And I ain't talkin' bout the extra aciditives and kick backs
Plus I know where your kids at
Where your other crib at, so that sheisty shit'll getcha kids kidnapped
Skip I don't believe you did that, not the kids
I'ma get mine, see that just how it is

Drop som'in ride through and glock som'in
Get locked up and ox som'in
Come home first day cop som'in

Banks chains look now Pacino I got som'in
Platinum Skytel 2-Way hot som'in
And I keep a hot som'in, models and actresses who got som'in
And they boxin' som'in, and they all willin' to cop me som'in
A little rocks or som'in so they can tell they friends they got me som'in
Got big guns, two five little pocket som'in's
Heavy machine guns, like five glocks and som'in
Now these bitches wanna act like I ain't hot or som'in
Pull up low riding new Porsche Boxster som'in

Lift niggaz off they feet when they run they lips
