[Chorus]
High rises, day breaks
Clouds hide the sun's rays
Quicksand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
even on the bad days
It's darkest before light
I'm gonna push through

[Curren$y]
Turbo-charged bars
Slot cars on track, falling off
Game stars in these rap wars
Ain't nothing Band-Aids won't cover
Touring with 7D coverage, live bands, two buses
My own cash, no budget, no major label fundings
Jets baby, we went from crawling to walking to running
You can't say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audis, hurting y'all with kicks, I'm the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain't gotta
I'm already on some whole other, word to your motherfucking self
Nobody else gon' do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then, somebody will off you help
But they ain't doing nothing till they really see you tryna do something
I ain't bluffing, kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables, homie take a whiff, yeah

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
Yeah, when you a man, action is what's expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer, never got time for no excuses, you gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that's free of ambiguity
Your goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It's coonery, it's lunacy
Let's make a plan, only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak with body language fluently
She make it rain, when I'm on fire she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home
like I broke the glass and let myself in, fighting for freedom
like the people in Tunisia and spread through Sudan and Egypt
This the music for the movement, the score to your achievements
Never join 'em so you gotta beat 'em, it's carpe diem, hey, (hey), yeah

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh huh, yeah, like kindergarteners, my vision's bothered
by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya, the starving'll speed on ya
Stampede on ya, impede on your pockets, then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending established with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in
to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
your seat belts twice, when I rolled them dice I crapped
so many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That's what my mental say, but my physical's been detached
I'm on some other shit, like fuck the government, I'm higher rankings
Where's the mothership? I made a covenant that I was changing
But my luck has been quite disgusting when reality tainted
Where the fuck you been? Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress? Nigga, which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick, know life's a bitch when you ain't focussed
Nigga, I'm focussed

[Chorus]</pre>
