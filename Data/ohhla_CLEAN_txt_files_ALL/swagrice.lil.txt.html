Song:   Swag Jerry Rice
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
Left hand stunting, right hand stunting (swag)
Championship ring and I look like Derek fisher
Word around town I got 25 bitches
Based on my ring, I got cocaine in that swisher
Fuck around with me that mac 11 touch your sister
Real west side the hood, twerk like a stripper
Nigga, I'm connected and I think I'm the mafia
I think I'm a Illuminati plus I got the shotgun
Ak still loaded, got my guns on layaway
56 hoes suck my dick cause I'm Gary Payton
I think I'm Michael Jackson, every bitch harass me
Tiny-ass pants, nigga, choppers from that action
Reppin' bitch mob cause hey know that I'm a killer
Shot from three-point and they call me Reggie miller
Bitches suck my dick cause they know that I'm iller
Strapped with glock 9's and they call me Reggie miller (based god)

[Chorus]
Swag jerry rice I think I'm jerry rice [4x]
Touchdown, touchdown, I think I'm jerry rice [4x]

Ted Debiase fucking with a stripper
Bitch pay me stacks I'm the cocaine dealer
Word around town I've got 5 going for 50
Word around town I'm in that s550
I think I'm Tyvon Branch because I think I'm on the Raiders
Vote for based god, because I'm running for the mayor
Fuck around with me, bitch, I show you worst player
Guns on the boat, and I'm cussing like a sailor
Think I'm Dr. Phil because I'm helpin' all my bitches
Hoes suck my dick gives a fuck what you feeling
Young based god, nigga, swag to the ceiling
Bitch, I'm bob marley comin' with that glock 40'
Bravo on this swag I hold that pistol in the morning
Nigga don't fuck with me I killed that bitch when I'm yawning
Because my nose big niggas think that I'm lyin'
36 bitches and they call me Don Imus

[Chorus]

Nigga, I ain't trippin'
Bitch, I ain't trippin'
Muggsy bogues guns, and they short like a midget
Bitch I got swag, and I'm still buying bitches
Paying for that pussy, every day Christmas (I got money, bitch!)
Pay a hoe rent, nigga, mind your own business
Fucked her in her mouth and that broad ain't trippin
Slide a ho 20 cuz I'm rich and I'm reckless
I'm a real thug, used to ride, stolen Lexus
Nah, I came up in that Bugatti and that Phantom
Nigga fuck with me that mac 11 make you handsome
Pay a bitch 10, I ain't got time for that talkin'
Young based god is a young kenny rogers
Die in wonton swag and I came with that chopper
Asking questions, bitch? yes, luke, I am your father
Still got the chopper, still got the ak
Young based god, suck my dick, bitch, I'm renegade

[Chorus]</pre>
