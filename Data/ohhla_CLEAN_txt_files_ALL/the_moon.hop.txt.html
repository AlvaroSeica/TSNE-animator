Song:   Gazing at the Moonlight
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro/Chorus]
Gazing at the moonlight, satan comes close to me
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh nananaaah
Gazing at the moonlight, devil comes close to me!
But mama told me never talk to strangers!

[Hopsin]
It's really hard to focus living in this world of sin
All balled up in a corner is what I wanna curl up in
So pearls n benz, money to spend, girls whos a ten
Fuck it baby, I promise ill never hurt you again
People fin' to be the best, not the best they can be
I use to be the same way, I guess its what satan made of me
Its somethin like slavery the way lucifer has us
All this glamorous shit we like to use it to trap us
Then he smiles as we run loose on his campus
And dances circles around say you think its fabulous
The glamorous, pay a price its all hype, its satan
But in the mean time shit is all right
Most people think the message I send you is stupid
And y'all are gonna ignore and just continue to do it
But as long as I made an attempt to convince you this shits cool
The rest of your destiny is within you

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
I'd rather go broke than go and give my soul away
My coldest day couldn't add up to Satan's prodigy
He's tellin me to jump but I'm sayin I don't obey
They say your soul is not owned till your bloods on the page
And he don't have to own your soul for you to do his dirt
Hes a master of ceremonies and thats why music works
All it takes is one rapper to make it big then through him
Satan will have the nation creatin sin and he wins
Then repeats the cycle over again
From many generations the time is close to the end
And all those times he was sayin fuck it
You'll be hit with the day of judgement and burn as the devils naked puppet
Take it as odd flows or take it as gospel shit
I'm just speakin the truth whether I make it or not, yo
You dont have to love just don't ever hate
And just know with satan here this world will never be a better place

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
So many times I have fell in this trap, im tellin the facts
He makes it seem like hell isnt bad, till this day I still get influenced
And even though I know it's sinnin
I'm willin to do it my ass ain't even improvin
Cause it's so hard to stop whats been taught for so many years
If I think about it too much ill just be rollin in tears
Sometimes I think why am I here, why do I feel
Like I'd be runnin in fear if ever the end was near
It's like, sin is in so much of everyones daily habits
That we dont even know we do it whenever it happens
Then it settles in like I shouldve never did that shit
I wanna enter the gate perfect rather than have this
If you had to turn your test in today
You think you would pass it or would you rest in the flames?
Who knows, theres only one way to find out and if you die now
There's no turnin back, it's your life pal

[Chorus]</pre>
