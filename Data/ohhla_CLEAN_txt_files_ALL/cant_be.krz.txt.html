Typed by: AZ Lyrics

What you're lookin' for is amazing
But I can't keep you waitin'
If I go away
But what I'm tryin' to say is I can't be the only one
This whole world's participatin'
And life's the game we playin'
And if I go away
I wasn't meant to stay
And I can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only

Yo, we livin' in the last days
Baby if you know my kind, I ain't got time to be livin' in the fast lane
I played my last game, clock's over fourth quarter
Cheaper to keep 'er, never misses Watson in the court order
Caught the love but saw 'er
The one the maddest program that thank you mam, lam bam and now they that order
Party your heart I can never slaughter
The statues I'm in love with your daughter, takin' it further
Cause now she got a baby that she carry, a pittle pattle, review the feed of my heart beat
I gotta work cause we gotta eat

And it's too many fishes in the sea
Keep my pole to control what these devilish bitches want from me

Grass is greener on my side of the fence, it's even good when it's tits
We prayin' we stay together, that's our defence
See I was wrong but I'm right now, went dark but it's bright now
Will I be like God's son? and I can't be the only one

What you're lookin' for is amazing
But I can't keep you waitin'
If I go away
But what I'm tryin' to say is I can't be the only one
This whole world's participatin'
And life's the game we playin'
And if I go away
I wasn't meant to stay
And I can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only

Yo, live the real life, what it feel like?
To have a famous individual is real nice
He has inhaled type skills for poppin' pills pipe drill
It feels right kill 'til night then heil sky
When it gone, but a brother got many things
That would cover 'bout any dream
But I love 'er not any means
No multiple gagin' or the one to form any team
Even if you lived in lake shore you're cabri green
And you know that, that it's hard to chew on that
You want that? When he's tourin' go nobody, screw on that
Please break it, Polly's takin' number 3's late
If you thinkin' about getting it deep when he's gone then he's crazy
Cause you see him 'bout once a year
When you do it shows
But you say you love him from his head to his toes and he believed you
That's just like a human thinkin' with the only right form
Given that booey so I can't be the only one hittin'

What you're lookin' for is amazing
But I can't keep you waitin'
If I go away
But what I'm tryin' to say is I can't be the only one
This whole world's participatin'
And life's the game we playin'
And if I go away
I wasn't meant to stay
And I can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only

If hip-hop just died this morning, I'm resurrecting it
Protect the neck of it way up, grab the best of us resefilis
The follow us religiously like we Baptists and Methodists
I haller after you kid of me of havin' to ref with this
I eat eat eat MC's for breakfast
And heat-seek geeks if they speakin' reckless
My speech seems lame like a gleem in necklace
Why y'all geeks follow me every Tweet my message
V.E. Lee he speaks this too deep
For you to see me if they speak queef through your teeth and ski
You'll never beat me, we are lookin' for a pot of gold
Baby sellin' me your records for we owe without sellin' our soul
Some men got the pipes for it (song)
But they pay 'em real nice for it
Michael down that's the best that ever did it
I mean that I should quit it
I'm done and I can't be the only one

What you're lookin' for is amazing
But I can't keep you waitin'
If I go away
But what I'm tryin' to say is I can't be the only one
This whole world's participatin'
And life's the game we playin'
And if I go away
I wasn't meant to stay
And I can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only
Can't be the
I can't be the only one</pre>
