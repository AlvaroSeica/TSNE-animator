O'Neal McKnight let's do it
pump yo fists in the air come on
pump yo fists in the air come on
wave em' round in the atmosphere
my people in the front my people in the rear
{*2X*}

[Greg Nice]
Yo this greg N-I with O'neal
cashin dubs on the wheels of steel
It's so hot I'm about to peel
my clothes off like an orange peel
who that in the black high heel
body is hot like jessica biel
just might write her in my will
party rockin from now until

[O'Neal McKnight]
I wonder why
I can't find that girl
Everytime that I...(everytime that I)
Close my eyes shes gone...(shes gone)
And then I return to my suite...(return to my suite)
Her scent has been callin me...(callin me)
But when I turn my head shes not there
So Im left here with this beat...(so you know what you gotta do)
Just check your coat...(just check your coat)
And let the music get inside you...(and let the music get inside you)
And we can dance the night away...(all night)
Just me and you...(just me and you, ooo just me and you)
I wanna try
to give this a chance...(just one chance)
Everytime I do...(Everytime I do)
Im just left with this dance...(lets dance, come on)
So I'm uptown and I'm down...(uptown and I'm down)
Just cause this girl might be around..(be around)
But when its 12 o'clock and the party's hot...(its going down now)
Shes gone and I'm left with this sound...(you know what you gotta do)
Just check your coat...(check your coat)
And let the music get inside you... (and let the music get inside you)
And we can dance the night away
Just me and you...(just me and you, ooo just me and you)
Sexy lady...(sexy lady)
Let me talk with you for a minute...(talk for a minute)
Im tryin tell you something...(tryin to tell you something)
Don't you get it
So listen to me, we can feel this in beat
We can grove centrally...(come on)
and dance all night

[Greg Nice]
Stepped in Ten June chicks everywhere
Hair hanging all the way to the dairy-air
Cuttin around like you just dont care
Flyin on an ass and you better beware
I'll be man with the savoir faire
Eat my steak well done not rare
Im'a get a slug and the hugs from the bear
Cant stand a chick with her nose in the air

[O'Neal McKnight]
Just check your coat...(just check your coat)
and let the music get inside you... (and let the music get inside you)
And we can dance the night away...(all night, all night)
Just me and you...(Just me and you, ooo just me and you)
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance)
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance)
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance)
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance)
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance) just come on, I feel you
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance) you feel me
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance) I feel you
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance) you feel me, Im rockin, I know you
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance) just feel it in ya soul
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance) just feel it in the grove
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance) just feel it in ya soul
I wanna dance...(I wanna dance) just feel it in the grove
just feel it in ya soul
just feel it in the grove

And I need you...(and I need you girl)
