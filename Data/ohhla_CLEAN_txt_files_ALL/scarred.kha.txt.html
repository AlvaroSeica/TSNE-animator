(talking)
Ma this song is for you...cuz i love you

My tears fall on the paper as i write this ryme
Its like somewhere in my life a part of me died
And through my eyes a forgotten pain...rott in vain
Escapin the hell fire runnin from flames
Seein moms on the kitchen floor
Not knowin that the dope she injected this time was to raw
Saw myself trapped in the womb tryin to get out
Consumed by this hell flamed pain i spit out
On the day we rest may our souls be free
I aint mad cuz this world made a cole like me
I forgive her cuz my mother gave us all she could
Just another black girl lost enslaved by the hood
I would trade my existance to give you breath
Guess the only guarantes in this life is death
As I look around seein im the last one left
And the things i cant change I just gotta accept

hook:(sang by Joya)
I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now whats it gonna be
And I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now can we all be free

Watchin the heat throdle on trail cuz niggaz is tellin
My rap sheet be the novel of a predicate felon
D.A. narrator of a story untold
Homicide found some evidence the truth unfold
Painten pictures for the jury that my heart seem cold
Let me explain
This life nearly drove me insane
Cell 33 i block lay in the flat
Eatin jack mack to far cant turn back
Niggaz rather see you layin on the coroners table
Unprepared for the war an even more disabled
Turn they backs on you slay you like Kane did Able
Heard took two in the chest an one in his navel
See my mom chose dope my pop chose the pipe
So I ryme like a triple beam balance in life
Hope the scale lean on my side so i can prevail
Most of us lay in the casket or locked in jail
Urban warfare guerilla combat
I seen a bullet tear a niggaz head off upon contact
So pour some Henny out for those not comin back
I pour this Henny out for my nigga killa black

(Singing by B-Minor)
My days and nights are getting longer
We can make it on these corners
I cant take it anymore death is knockin at my door
Will my whole life pass me by
I try to escape when I get high
I dont no if I will survive
Will I live or will I die
I dont wanna wait

hook:(sang by Joya)
I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now whats it gonna be
And I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now can we all be free

The criminal way a foul price to pay
Another dark day reminisin on ty yey
19 dead plus had baby on the way
Its real shit chicken heads they dont be feelin shit
Pain runs deep in my life
It just reveals it late night
Im jumpin out the bed in cold sweat
Drippen wet playin my gate wit cigerette
Up north six months an aint seen my girl yet
She wrote me once told me she was doin her thing
Wrote her back told her live her life by all means
Peep game cuz things aint as real as it seems
Slit her own moms throat for the taste of cream
Had my man dead up for the chedda time will come
But she bounced down south an took my son
If I could reach out an touch her she just get bucked
But im locked out stressed out mad as fuck
and I down wanna wait

hook:(sang by Joya) 3x
I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now whats it gonna be
And I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now can we all be free</pre>
