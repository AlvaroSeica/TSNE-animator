Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I know plenty of hoes in love with they niggas
But they be the same bitch thats fucking niggas
She blame it on you
Say you breaking her heart
So when she around us
She playin her part
Party time my nigga
She say its party time
Popping her pussy like a pill till its morning time
And you at home sending texts to the bitch
Talking shit bout to click and she telling us the shit we know
That you the type of nigga fall in love with pussy
We the type fall asleep don't even touch the pussy
I'm in the strip club throwing yesterdays money
You in the same club throwing other niggas money
So you tell me who's what
Who the real G
You tryna be a better me you gotta kill me
You running round acting like you got the crown
Man I'm tired of being modest
Tell these niggas bow down
You know that I'm the only reason they gave you a chance
Follow a nigga blueprint we gave you the plan
And if I got your main bitch taking pictures with me
Just know she coming to the room sipping liquor with me
And if she ain't sipping with me
She sipping with us
She say you gotta hold it down if she giving it up
Yeah she look around and smile at everybody
And say I'm down but yall cant tell nobody
That...

[Chorus]
She fucking the crew
What the fuck you gon do
You can't fuck with the crew
She fucking the crew
She fucking the crew
What the fuck you gon do
You can't fuck with the crew
She fucking the crew

Uh, I know this girl that fucked the whole city
She tried to hit me up for some fucking pity
Like you never called me or texted back
Your everybodys pussy I could never touch that
And I could blast her ass
Like she tried to do me
But really she just want to get to know the knew me
You know the big star
With the diamond rings and the black chain
But I'm still the same Nigga that you knew a couple years ago
But you a hoe so I'd fuck you and your feelings hoe
And she boucing her ass for a couple of dollars
Bitch lieing all the time like the collinar
I'm young simba man I cant wait to be the king
This bitch here man she cant wait to fuck the team
Bitch tryna get her acts up
New nigga every month
Get her tatts up tattoo my name on you so I know its real
Or tattoo my name on you if you dumb as hell
Uh, cause that shit don't mean shit to me
I mean you ain't shit but a clit to me
My game ain't counterfitted
If she ain't talkin bout the click why the fuck you bring a glitch to me
She say a nigga never listen so we showed a bitch what she missin
Now...

[Chorus]
She fucking the crew
What the fuck you gon do
You can't fuck with the crew
She fucking the creew She fucking the crew
What the fuck you gon do
You can't fuck with the crew
She fucking the crew</pre>
