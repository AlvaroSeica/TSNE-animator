Party people, have no fear
The group is back in attack for the '88 year
It's the Gangster Boogie with the shot
Come on y'all, let's rock (rock) (rock)

(Gangster Boogie)		--&gt; Chicago Gangsters
( *shot* )
(Get on up)			--&gt; Bobby Byrd
(Gangster Boogie)
( *shot* )
(Get into it)		--&gt; Bobby Byrd

(Get involved)		--&gt; Bobby Byrd

( *shot* )
(Get on up)

Okay man, that's a great intro
But we don't have all the people on the dancefloor
Let em know we're the rappers that score
Yo man, what you waitin for?

[ Toddy Tee ]
Well... the lights, cameras, action sound
Gimme that mic, I'm about to throw down
Sucker MC's, I'm back in the saddle
Form a line here if you want to battle
Yes, it's the two and the Batterram crew
Together forever and we're stickin like glue
And we'll never bite a rhyme cause the rhymes we write
Are sealed and approved and wrapped up tight

Yeah, I liked that groove right there
But we still got someone in their chair
Get em outta their hair, man
Rock em

[ Toddy Tee ]
Yes, I'm hip to cocaine but it's all the same
Cause it's the power of drugs to make you do weird things
I'm not sayin this to front on the crowd
Like J.B. said: (I'm black and I'm proud) say it loud
You're not a witness on the Contras scam
My voice is your choice for the Gangster jam
The high rollers of rap are back in your town
So let's rock this Boogie with the woogie-oogie breakdown

Now man, you rocked it def
You took the Gangster Boogie off the shelf
Now Spade, give us the chance
So man, explain the dance

[ Mix Master Spade ]
The Gangster Boogie is a dance that is def
And guaranteed like speed to make you run out of breath
So just shake your hips and move your head
With style and grace like you're lovin in bed
Only few will learn and a couple have tried
So just shake your rump from side to side
And if you got good rhythm then you'll learn quick
Hey yo Todd (What, Spade?) Let's bust it

(Yeah, haha)
(Do you wanna get funky with me?)
(Yeah, haha)
(Do you wanna get funky with me?)
(Yeah, haha)
(Do you wanna get funky with me?)
(Yeah, haha)
(Do you wanna get funky with me?)

[ Toddy Tee ]
Well, we're boogiein down and the style's unique
The Gangster Boogie is known on the Compton streets
You don't fire no guns at your feet to dance
You just give that sucker ( ? ) a chance
The Gangster Boogie is famed across the nation
And we're dancin in front of the police station
With Spade on my side I ain't takin no slack
The critic said it was over, Toddy Tee brought it back

Okay, you proved to me the Gangster Boogie was def
You took it right off the shelf, man
Now let's rock this beat as we jam on

(Gangster Boogie)

(Get on up)
(Gangster Boogie)
( *shot* )
(Get into it)
(Gangster Boogie)
( *shot* )
(Get involved)
(Gangster Boogie)

(Get on up)
(Gangster Boogie)

Rock (rock) (rock) (rock)
