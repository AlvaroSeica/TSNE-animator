[Brinson]
Well hello, hello hello
I knew you would come
Well hello
I knew you would, I knew you would, I knew you would

I grab the mic, and leave 'em in the dust now
I rep for Christ, no longer my nuts now
They rappin 'bout nothin made in a million
God's secret weapon introducin Brinson
I came bust some souls, no boy not that gold
No chain, no cars, and no furry Kangols
I know you tired of that same old same old
Well here's somethin new to bump in your ringtones
I ain't a rapper but a preacher not a dancer like Keisha
Cole, I ain't slangin crack either
No "American Gangster," you tight well thank ya
Better yet thank God, oh yes sir

Well hello, hello hello
I knew you would come
Well hello
I knew you would, I knew you would, I knew you would</pre>
