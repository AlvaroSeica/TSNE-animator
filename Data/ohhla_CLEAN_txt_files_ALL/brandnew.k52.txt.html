Song:   Brand New Day
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Wooooah oh oh
Staring over in a brand new way
Woooahh oh oh
Shout it out it's a brand new day
And I'll never ever ever be the same
No I'll never ever ever be the same

Your sun light is on my face
Your life is all I chase
I Run right upon this race
Cause in you I'm gone put all my faith
Some nights I lose my way
Sometimes I walk and stray
But you come right inside my space
And each time you come you give me strength
This time I fix my gaze
This time it wont be the same
This time I wont be ashamed
So this time I can't help but say that..

Your sunlight is on my face
I look back how far I came
I think about how much I've changed
It was hard at times but I'm not the same
You deserve all this praise
You deserve all the fame
You deserve all my ways
I point back to you each and all my days
I reach and grab all you've gave
I see your hands all you've made
I see your plan and all you'd save
That we can have life (got me singingÂ…)

[Bridge]
I'm not where I want to be
But I'm not where I used to be
I'm not where I want to be
But I'm not where I used to be</pre>
