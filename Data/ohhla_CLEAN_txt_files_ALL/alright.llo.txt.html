[Intro] 
Whoa, yeah, yeah 
Aha-aha 

[Chorus: Big Marcus] 
I've been hustling, I've been grinding 
I've been praying all my life 
I been waiting, anticipating 
Knowing that one day, it's gonna be alright 

[Lil' O] 
But right now, it ain't 
I wish I could tell you, it's all good but I can't 
A nigga stressed out, and I'm trying not to faint 
But all I know is Wacka Flacka, go hard in the paint 
Put your back against the wall, nigga start swanging 
Come up with a plan, hit the block and start stanging 
Ain't no time to hesitate, when bullets start ranging 
And your pockets fucked up, and your partnas start changing 
Yeah, better rumble young man rumble 
They say, that only beasts survive in the jungle 
Well if that's the case, I caught a case 
Went to that place, got out and put it right back in they face 
See I know, about up's and down's 
But one thing I know, you can't keep a hustler down 
I hold my head high, but let my nuts touch the ground 
Cause I'll be back, with a long dick to fuck the town 

[Chorus: Big Marcus] 
I've been hustling, I've been grinding 
I've been praying all my life 
I been waiting, anticipating 
Knowing that one day, it's gonna be alright 
Forever, we balling 
Stacking our cheddar, it's gonna be alright 

[J-Dawg] 
Yeah, no time for folding soldier be strong 
Be strong, don't fall homie hold on 
Yeah nigga hold on, just stay focused 
Get behind me, Satan with all his old shit 
Tell em, Lord tell em I'm a changed dude 
And I'm starving, Lord tell em 'fore they be food 
Please, get the fuck up out my way 
I been trying to walk straight, but it's been a week and I ain't ate 
Yeah, these pussy niggaz walking passed me 
Full bellies and they laughing, like I won't take they plate 
Bitch, all I ever known was get it on 
And you could still get it bitch, don't get it wrong 
And don't get me wrong, no I don't wanna do it 
But I been starving it's been hard, nigga I been going through it 
And I been grinding, I been staying on my knees praying 
Trying to move forward, through this quick sand 

[Chorus] 

[Lil' O] 
Tell me, do you feel my pain 
Boys call me broke, and I feel ashamed 
It's hell around here, you could feel the flames 
Stiff nigga talk, man this real shit will kill a lame 

[J-Dawg] 
Yeah mayn, must be living in them last days 
Real niggaz turn hoes, faggot ass ways 
Whatever happened to the code, loyalty and shit 
Fuck a nigga and a bitch, y'all can eat a dick trill shit 

[Lil' O] 
But I gotta stay prayed up 
Even though, the bills ain't paid up 
All the nights I couldn't sleep, and I stayed up 
Thinking bout swangas, dreaming that I was J'd up 

[J-Dawg] 
Shit who you telling, where I'm from dreams is all we had 
And even those got stole, shit was all bad 
I use to watch an O.G., coming through on swangs 
Couldn't wait to grow up, and do that same thang 

[Chorus] 

[Big Marcus] 
Forever, we balling stacking our cheddar 
It's gonna be alright 
Said it's gonna be alright 
I've been praying Lord, it's gonna be</pre>
