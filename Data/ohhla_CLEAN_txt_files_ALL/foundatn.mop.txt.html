[Ice-T and Chris Rock in "New Jack City"]
Yo check this out homeboy
God's on your side right? So why don't you do this, reasonable
14K, bow, pzzshw, I'm Audi
(You wanna do this direct or not man? 17 man)
(Yo lemme see the money, lemme see the money)
(Whassup, whassup, whassup, whassup?)
Yeah c'mon let's do this man {*unzips bag*}
What'chu know about that homeboy?

[Intro: M.O.P.]
We, made it easy to trace it, we back with the basics
It's hard to replace it - you know exactly what it is

[Billy Danze]
Uhh M DOT, O DOT, we still hard with it
Yo' block, his block, we still armed with it
While y'all stopped hip-hop, we moved on with it
Got it on with it, spit it and rung alarms with it
And nowadays I've aged, so I'm calm with it
But I'm the reason Flex started droppin them bombs with it
Up by the club love thugs that's war with it
While the homies in the hood decided to go on, get it
And no, I ain't change lanes on you lil' dudes
I just upgraded my game on you lil' dudes
FOUNDATION - a whole different set of rules
Premeditation you facin predicates fool
You better be cool, I give you the WOMP WOMP
I go in the glove box and WOMP WOMP your top

[Chorus: M.O.P.]
We, made it easy to trace it, we back with the basics
It's hard to replace it - you know exactly what it is
(FOR THE FOUNDATION!) We suffered blood sweat and tears
and cleared all complications
Put it down, in many situations
Yes kid, you are the last generation
So for the continuation
We, do what we do for the next generation
We, made it easy to trace it, we back with the basics
It's hard to replace it - you know exactly what it is

[Lil' Fame]
Run 'em down, gun 'em down, it's crazy when we come around
Insane from the underground, 200 and somethin pounds
You know my motto, both arms covered with body art
Don't catch a hollow, we keep arms, fuck a bodyguard
Let me remind you, how I do
If you think I'm just spittin a rhyme nigga you sick as the swine flu
Cause this ain't rap dummy, you get your fuckin face clapped
And they gon' have to fix yo' face back with putty (BOOM)
Get it ugly (BOOM) we do it 3-6-5
+Day 'N Nite+ but I ain't Kid Cudi, it's
M.O.!! Spittin devious thoughts, I'm from where niggaz
around house kicked your moms, snatched her beads and her cross
Where they hustle hard, tryin to get the keys to the Porsche
Just some of them young boys do it for no reason at all cause

[Chorus]

[Outro 4X: singers]
We keep flippin it, we still bringin it
You be lovin what we do

[M.O.P.]
We, made it easy to trace it, we back with the basics
It's hard to replace it - you know exactly what it is</pre>
