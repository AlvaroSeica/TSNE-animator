[D-Sisive]
I've been writing black and white, trying to fill some color in
Pencil crayon scribbling, finger paint brushing
but the brights that I choose lose life once the color hits
the white of the canvas, I lie on the canvas
Behind my, dukes up in a pair of oven mitts
Eyes closed, throwin jabs, hopin that a punch connects
But all I ever hit is wind and my chin stops another knuckle hit
A sucker for punishment, down for another 10
Then up I get, black eyes, bloody lips
Spit in a bucket, tryin to rinse out the muddy red
Through my mailbox slot slides another bill
Bone Thugs, "First of Tha Month," comin up with rent
My agent booked me a show for a hundred quid
60 bucks spent on gas and my supper
So the luxurious life's a hundred miles from my touch and grip
Back to my 9 to 5 or tryin to find another gig
8 A.M. on the bus to another shift
Eight hours feelin fuckin dead, swallow Atavan
to take off the fuckin edge, Edge solo, pluck and shred
Bono don't let my "Bloody Sunday" fuckin end
Blackberry buzzin, wife sends another text
The only human on this planet that I love to death
Ever since my father and my mother left
She was heaven sent, her words feed me like fuel
'til I get home and kiss her on her puckered lips
She tells me she loves me
I sit in darkness, comin up with songs for another record
A couple steps on my treadmill
I see a sihlouette, in a small t-shirt and underwear
beggin me to come bed - I'll be another minute
It's 4 A.M. and I'm sleeping on the floor again
Keith Herring book playing pillow under head
Writing black and white, trying to fill some color in
Pencil crayon scribbling, finger paint brushing
but the brights that I choose lose life once the color hits
the white of the canvas, I lie on the canvas
A frozen snow angel, a jolly good fellow
nobody can deny, trying to write a fucking hit
Hehe...

"For he's a jolly good fellow" {*3X*}
"which nobody can deny" {*3X*}
"For he's a jolly good fellow"
"which nobody can deny!"</pre>
