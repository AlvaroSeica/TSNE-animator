[Intro: Free Murda]
Yeah, Lil' Free, F-R-double E
Sha-Cronz, the high Juan
Shit is real in this shit
Ty-Jigs, Pyzone, Billy Box
Fort Greene, middle side
Yo, Billy Box for harder life
Yo, yo..

[Free Murda]
With the gauge I play men
You cavemen, push coke whiter than caucasions
Niggaz facin 25 to life for bein hard headed like Haitians
I keep the gauge blazin, I'm aimin, never raisin
Ain't no tellin how these faggots might come through, sprayin
On the low I'm layin, I'll be damned it's me they framin
Pfft, spit the ox out, have his face flamin
Like herpes, niggaz burner start decayin
Dead for days, on the 12th gun, the hallway
Play the crib all day, with me chicks do foreplay
Bangin at the spots, no more back out the cops
Gettin yolked up like Halloween with kids on the block
Ya heard?

[Chorus 2X: Free Murda]
Yo, fuck that sweet shit, I'm sour
Glance at your click for hours
Pull out long shit like the Twin Towers
Mics are quiet, but this little nigga bring the riots
Thugs I hire, pussies I fire

[Free Murda]
Yo, what it is? Yo, what?
D's on the low, gun in they lap, in the Montaro
Walk through, chain out in your borough
Stay thorough, have niggaz shift like Jello
Always say peace on the phone, never hello
Keep a rubber band around my hundreds, tied up
Get my cocks up, the majority of my click is locked up
I created monsters, gave you heart when we was partners
Now against you, had to use revolvers
You caused problems, now you can't solve 'em
Shot hollows, you can't dodge 'em
Y'all niggaz is like bugs, I squash 'em
My style is awesome, extortin niggaz, flossin
Murder scene, yellow line, caution
You shouldn't've forfeited, I keep gats often
Position out of proportion, then I lost it
Swiss cheese and coughin, DT's in a Ford Taurus
Chasin niggaz in the Ford Explorers
That'll draw guns, nigga

[Chorus 2X - replace "glance" with "blast" in 2nd line]

[Free Murda]
Yo, everywhere I go, my Cronz come with me
If it's your face I've blown, you caught a Buck 50
Niggaz that bust shots, they better not hit me
Free pump more water than Mississipi
Halfback, pants down with a Taurus 380
Pistol whip the judge lady and left that bitch Swayze
Blacks say I'm crazy and half shade say I'm loco
Because in the dutch or the backwood you puff cocoa
Hold more weight than that shit that you lift
Red dot on your forehead called the inf'
Niggaz is snakes just like Anaconda
Don't even bother, it doesn't matter, auto or revolver
I take the auto cuz it goes off, automatically
My slugs spit and fly vertically, improve diagonally
Sawed off hit the ball court, pass the torch
Shells burn like hot sauce, when I let off, nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[Free Murda]
Yo, what? What?
Yo, yo, what it is y'all?
Fort Greene, middle side, give it up
Far side, first side, U.K.
Bed-stuy, U.K.</pre>
