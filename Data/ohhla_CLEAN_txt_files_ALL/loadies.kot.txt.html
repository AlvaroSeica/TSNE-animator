Up in smoke until the day we die

To all the smokers and the tokers from around the way
we goin' up in smoke like every day cause we Loadies

To all the smokers and the growers all across the land
we goin' up in smoke until we free the plant cause we Loadies

I'm a stoner call me a loadie
a big time toker

A burnt out slacker

You know we get a fifth
and rippin' when were clippin'
in the pool smoking chronic yeah you know we like spittin' stop trippin'
stop trippin' man. You could catch a feelin' when I'm spittin' smokin' chronic

To all the smokers and the tokers from around the way
we goin' up in smoke like every day cause we Loadies

To all the smokers and the growers all across the land
we goin' up in smoke until we free the plant cause we Loadies

If you like to smoke chronic and stay real high
