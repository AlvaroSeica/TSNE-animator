[VERSE 1]
(Move em, U) Ah yeah, the U's in effect
Live and direct I project my intellect
I wrote another verse for imitators to copy-cat
You learn the words, recitin's where you get sloppy at
You can't kick it quite like the U can
Any fan in the stand can tell whose rhymes you ran
Man, the words the same, verses identical
Wanna be down, but you ain't been a cool
Brother like the U, so my knob you're slobbin
31 flavors like Baskin &amp; Robbin
The U trains by drainin brains
And the only remains is bloodstains
Havoc and homicide, rappers are mumified
You tried, but lost your pride, now you run and hide
You're trapped in a maze, there's no escape route
Guilty of theft, so you're left as a deaf-mute
You floor at my feet, but when I step you're left there
With tears in your eyes, but I don't care
Nothin you can do, now you're down and desperate
Next time you know I ain't the one to mess with
So keep this in mind before you move
Yo, the U is smooth

[VERSE 2]
(Yo U, tell em how you're livin, gee)
Sittin in my dressin room with a star on my door
The crowd is waitin for the show to be raw
News reporters is hawkin me, fans anticipatin
It's almost show time, so keep waitin
2 minutes left, now you're watchin the clock
Countin every second to the last tic-toc
Now the spotlight shines, the curtains go up
And like a vulcano Daddy U will erupt
I jitter-bop on stage and grab the mic with a tight grip
I carry a tool for any fool who might flip
Cause when I'm in effect pandemonium breaks loose
You ask how I did it? I tell you it takes juice
No other brother can touch the U, I'm too smooth
And that's word to momma du'
All raps I write is up to par
I started out at the bottom, now I live like a star
I'm talkin flicks and autographs, saunas and bubble baths
Producers and managers hawkin me like psychopaths
Everything is real, so bust a move
And remember: the U is smooth

[VERSE 3]
(Yo, tell em what's up with your deejay, man)
Kay's a doctor, his headphones a stethoscope
Music's a medicine, scratch is so def it's dope
You will agree, Kay Cee is nasty
So check out the cut and knowledge how fast he
Switched from one mix to the next
On pace with the bass, all it takes is a flex
And I pimp the microphone, this stage is like my throne
So leave my rhymes alone, homes, and write your own
I'm like Simon, so listen cause Simon says
Commence dancin, and I'ma keep rhymin as
Long as there's a beat, but if it stop I'll still go
My brain's equipped with more volts than Willco
So plug up the mic, if it works I'll work it
And Kay'll kill the cut till the mixer short-circuit
Cause everything's real, so bust a move
And remember: the U is smooth

[VERSE 4]
(Yo U, kick the last verse, let's get outta here, man)
Get ready, it's almost showtime
And I'ma turn it out in no time
So park your ride, maintain your stride
Pay your 10 dollars to get inside
You say it's too much, don't worry it's worth it
No mistakes, everything is perfect
A line around the corner, seven heads to a car means
The crowd is packed in like sardines
Security is tight for those who came to fight
I'll jump on any chump who try to spoil my night
Cause I got plans for girls on the dancefloor
Niggas wanna know what I.U. stands for
The I is for in there, U's for untouchable
And the shit you pop is just a bunch of bull
Everything is real, so bust a move
And remember: the U is smooth

Yeah
Yo, I wanna say what's up to
My man Money Mike Floyd
My DJ Kay Cee
My man E.R.P. Easy Rick The Player
Vaughn, Biz, the man Doc
The whole Crown Heights
And peace and love to my daughter Muffin
