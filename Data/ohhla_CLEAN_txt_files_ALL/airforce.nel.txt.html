[Intro]
Big boy.. Big boy.. Big boy

[Chorus]
I said give me two pair
(cause) I need two pair
So I can get to stompin in my air force ones
(Big boys) stompin in my air force ones

[Nelly]
I like the all white high top strap with the gum bottom
(Big boy) There's somthin bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
(Big boy) I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
(Big boy) The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em  

[Kyjuan]
(Big boy) Now if you look, and see lime green Forces, it's Kiwi
(Big boy) You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
(Big boy) (Big boy) you know I keeps it hip-hop, my niggas flip flop
(Big boy) Yea my Force Ones in tip top (me) your 4-4 flip flops

[Ali]
(Big boy) Me? I like the limited edition, and khaki, and army green
(Big boy) Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
(Big boy) Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a cardinal cap
(Big boy) All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at 

[Murphy Lee]
(Big boy) Don't get me wrong man, and Murphy Lee ain't dumb man
(Big boy) Cause if the shoe is on the shelf you should have some man
(Big boy) You can not sit up and tell me that you have none man
(Big boy) You may not have three or four but you got one man (big boy)

[Chorus x2]

[Murphy Lee]
We up in Foot Locker I'm lookin like I need those
(Big boy) Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
(Big boy) I can tell she never seen murphy lee befo'
(Big boy) Cause she's just standin there as if I'm shootin free throws
(Big boy) I said, "Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes"
(Big boy) She said, "I love you Murph especially in the white 'n blue"
(Big boy) I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice"
(Big boy) And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), "Thanks for the advice"

[Ali]
(Big boy) I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
(Big boy) Purple in gold with the Lakers the broncos the orange in blue
(Big boy) I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops, (big boy) which are clear so
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold
(Big boy) But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
(Big boy) Then it's back to the all purpose wit them lil' dots in the toe
(Big boy) Then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho
(Big boy) On dem Nike Air Force, an "E" behind the "O"
        
[Kyjuan]
(Big boy) O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
(Big boy) Chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
(Big boy) Spray candy on the swoosh, with the electric roof
(Big boy) Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a whiter shoe
(Big boy) You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Big boy) (Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
(Big boy) Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
(Big boy) Ain't no point in tryin these on, you know I'm buyin dem

[Nelly]
(Big boy) Now don't nothing get the hype on first site like, white on whites
(Big boy) Them three quarters too loose, they all tight
(Big boy) The only problem they only good for one night
(Big boy) Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
(Big boy) What's my basis? The look up sto on his faces
(Big boy) This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
(Big boy) Cause once I cop 'em gut 'em and switch the laces
(Big boy) They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my datin (big boy)

[Chorus x2]

[Kyjuan]
I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
(Big boy) Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
(Big boy) These Louie for Taiwan you gotta wait on dem
(Big boy) I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

[Murphy Lee]
(Big boy) Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
(Big boy) While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
(Big boy) Jewelry and all (wow) fish bowlin 'em all
(Big Boy) (I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

[Nelly]
(Big boy) Now some time I get em free some time I gotta pay
(Big boy) Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
(Big boy) Gimme the black and platinum, and leather gray
(Big boy) Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

[Ali]
(Big boy) Now where da boxes where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine (Big boy), (beep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
(Big boy) I'm just a sneaker pro, I love pumas and shell toes
(Big boy) but cant nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl (big boy)

[Chorus x2]

Big boy.. Big boy.. Big boy</pre>
