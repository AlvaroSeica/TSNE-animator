[Intro: Tek]
Uh! Man I never did no shit like this before man
I just keep hearin this fuckin voice in my head man
It's like it's good vs. evil really man
On one side I hear somethin, and on the other side I hear some other shit

[Verse One: Tek] (Steele)
It feel like fire (Fire) Shut up in your bones
What's this devilish shit you on?
(It's like the body of a vampire, you knocturnal, you don't tire)
Only move around in the dark
The light burns your skin you have no heart
(They call me Mr. Sinister, arch angel, Lucifer)
I'm a son to the anarchy
I'll show you the way if you follow me
(And I come in many shapes, the message I spread to you, is HATE!)
And I'm a catch you a homicide
They killed your cousin in your face and you 'gon let it slide?!
(But I got plans for ya, do this for me I'll show ya how my child adore ya)

[Chorus: Tek] (Smif-N-Wessun)
I feel like I'm torn (FIRE!) What's right or wrong? (FIRE!)
All my thoughts are lethal (FIRE!) I see dead people (FIRE!) Lord help me!
I feel like I'm torn (FIRE!) What's right or wrong? (FIRE!)
All my thoughts are lethal (FIRE!) I see dead people (FIRE!) Lord help me!

[Verse Two: Tek] (Steele)
Now do it just how we planned
(Get right up on him and BLAM!)
You can do it from the front or behind
(But I wanna see a nigga lose his mind)
And don't worry 'bout the police
(That's just one less nigga on the streets)
And now this block is yours
(His girl is yours!) The world is yours!
(I'm just a voice in ya head)
A figment of your imagination instead
(And I spoke to the best of them, got a long list
and I ain't get to the rest of them)
(And not yet, how much you wanna bet, I make you go postal shootout your projects)
(Or you whole school, you a young fool, and don't nobody love you like I do)

[Chorus: Tek] (Smif-N-Wessun)
I feel like I'm torn (FIRE!) What's right or wrong? (FIRE!)
All my thoughts are lethal (FIRE!) I see dead people (FIRE!) Lord help me!
I feel like I'm torn (FIRE!) What's right or wrong? (FIRE!)
All my thoughts are lethal (FIRE!) I see dead people (FIRE!) Lord help me!

[Verse Three: Steele] (Tek)
My child! I have a place you could rest
And take the stress off your chest
Just sell me your soul and we go
To the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
I make you rich (Celebrity overnight)
Fuck bitches (Sell drugs) Live your life
(Don't need to worry 'bout nothin!)
Keep on gunnin, keep on hustlin
(Plus I know how to make it pop)
Oh you a hot boy? I know you like it hot
(So give a nigga up, go 'head, wear a wire set a nigga up)
(And all your care about is Benji's)
Triflin you don't feed the hood, you stingy!
(And it's just a dream and it don't seem right)
(You ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light?)

[Chorus: Tek] (Smif-N-Wessun)
I feel like I'm torn (FIRE!) What's right or wrong? (FIRE!)
All my thoughts are lethal (FIRE!) I see dead people (FIRE!) Lord help me!
I feel like I'm torn (FIRE!) What's right or wrong? (FIRE!)
All my thoughts are lethal (FIRE!) I see dead people (FIRE!) Lord help me!
