I said one two three four
In slow

As I flow
Crowd goes up and down like a yo-yo
Hail the master the ruler over ____
Meat to a mike like Shaq to a ball
Tough like a tank not pumped like a filo
I'm breaking up with a girl I'm leaving her weeped like a willow
I'm totally in love with a kids beat silhouette
Till I see another one better
Eight to twelve a rapper just for fun
My desire inspite of her [____ (echo) G(echo)]
But now I'm the epitome
Years and Years and ya cant get rid of me
From the dark age into the renaissance
The rap obsession caused the regression
But one (minute la(o)ter?) and that means me
To show you what it takes to be a real MC
You need (wickedy wickedy?) rhymes [SCRATCHING]
With a (stickedy stickedy?) style [SCRATCHING]
And if you think ?it could take a while [SCRATCHING]
You need to need to take your take ya time to pursue it [SCRATCHING]
Till you're (wicky wicky?) rhymes flow right through it [SCRATCHING]
Chitty chitty bang bang chitty bang chitty

For the people in the city

Heavy on bass

Back in the day they used a judge a MC
On what?
By how amped and loud the whole crowd would be
I go eh
They go eh
If I go yeh
They go yeh
Yeh yeh yeh yeh
