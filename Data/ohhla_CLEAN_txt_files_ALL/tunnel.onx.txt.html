[Intro: Fredro Starr]
Yeah! Yeah we takin niggas back
You know what I'm sayin? 
It's sunday night, Westside Highway, 27th and 1th avenue
The notorious, home of the juxs, home of the robberies
Home of the bodies, the illest club in New York, The Tunnel

[Verse One: Fredro Starr]
Yo! Let's take it back to The Tunnel, where the hoods will run upon you
For the jux son, as soon as they play +Shook Ones+
The wolves from Brooklyn, always roll deep 
+Who Shot Ya?+ Somebody gettin rocked to sleep
Security make you take your Timbs off in the winter
And walk through the metal detectors before you enter
When you get inside, might be a homicide
With that New York hip hop, somebody might get shot
This is where they snatch jewels razors will splash you
Flex screamin out in the club don't let 'em gas you
Niggas takin pictures of money you know, cash rules
Bitches givin head, in the unisex bathroom
This is hell where the criminals dwell
Half the goons in the club just came home from jail
Other half couldn't come 'cause they couldn't make bail
It's cold on the Westside +It ain't hard to tell+
In The Tunnel!

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz] (Snowgoons scratchin)
The Tunnel! (Let's take it back)
Let's take it back to The Tunnel!!! (L-L-Let's take it way way back!)
The Tunnel! (Let's take it back)
Let's take it back to The Tunnel!!! (L-L-Let's take it way way back!)

[Verse Two: Cormega] (Snowgoons scratchin)
Posted up, goons ferocious jewels cold as fuck
Those who dream about schemin, we woke 'em up
My Fort Greene niggas was born to squeeze triggers
My Queens regime was at the bar deep chillin
The Tunnel was the place for all the street niggas
You know it's real
You can go in there and see people you know from jail
Home at last holdin stacks and dough in hand
Moment in silence Big L was always there
And Chris Lighty ran The Tunnel, he was the man
I've seen Diddy buy the bar out and shut it down
Please believe Free and Nitty didn't fuck around
I walked the crowd with Tims on because my style
Is New York to the fullest, we don't bow
All the dudes who want the crown are fuckin clowns
The Tunnel is proof, street niggas run this town
(L-L-L-L-L-L-L)

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz] (Snowgoons scratchin)
The Tunnel! (Let's take it back)
Let's take it back to The Tunnel!!! (L-L-Let's take it way way back!)
The Tunnel! (Let's take it back)
Let's take it back to The Tunnel!!! (L-L-Let's take it way way back!)

[Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz]
Stickin niggas at The Tunnel is how I use to eat
Soon as you step foot on that cobblestone street
And this is the same spot where Hype shot Belly
You could get popped, end up gettin shot in yo' belly
Come through stuntin like yo' ass is bad
You'll get juxed up sent out in a plastic bag
This the grimiest club in the whole city
I'm talkin stick up kids, murderers, NYPD
Westside on 27th down the block from the projects
Just walk into The Tunnel you'll get shot up and carjacked
I partied with killers, rapers and lifers
If it wasn't for the bitches you would think it's Rikers
That's back when, I never smiled alot
Was on my +New York State Of Mind+ shit around the clock
And it wasn't just niggas from the N.Y.C.
It was C.T., D.C., V.A., P.A., N.C., L.I., M.D., N.J.
At The Tunnel!!!

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz] (Snowgoons scratchin) (*Papoose)
The Tunnel! (Let's take it back)
Let's take it back to The Tunnel!!! (L-L-Let's take it way way back!)
The Tunnel! (Let's take it back)
Let's take it back to The Tunnel!!! (*Papoose, Pa-poose)

[Verse Four: Papoose]
Sticky, 'mega and Fredro Starr black ski mask hoodies and crowbars
Hip Hop purist prestige lyrical flow gods 
Grew up in The Tunnel we came here to expose y'all
To the most dangerous night club in the whole world
Unemployed ex-cons thugs thuggin with no job
Chain snatchin stick up killers who came to go rob
Pocket nife gemstar boxcutters to blow y'all
Drug traffickin coke, pills and hydro jars
Fly diva hoodrat dime bitches with no draws
Fingerwaves braids and shades givin out blowjobs
Walked around the corner The Tunnel line is so long
Skipped everybody, Brooklyn niggas is so strong
The ice grill era, face fightin get stoned on
Punch you in face and givin you a fuckin nose job
Them bougie clubs and day parties control y'all
The real recognize the real we don't even know y'all

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz] (Snowgoons scratchin)
The Tunnel! (Let's take it back)
Let's take it back to The Tunnel!!! (L-L-Let's take it way way back!)
The Tunnel! (Let's take it back)
Let's take it back to The Tunnel!!! (L-L-Let's take it way way back!)
[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz] (Snowgoons scratchin)
The Tunnel! (Let's take it back)
Let's take it back to The Tunnel!!! (L-L-Let's take it way way back!)
The Tunnel! (Let's take it back)
