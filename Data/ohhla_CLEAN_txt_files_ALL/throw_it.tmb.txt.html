[Intro: The Hives]
The time has come; flyweight champion of the world!!
(Flyweight champion of the world)
The time has come {hey girl}
The Hives

[Timbaland]
Take it to the back of the club
fast talkin, don't take this the wrong way
I've been peepin that ass
and if you give me my chance I ain't gon' play
I really want to get to know ya
that's what I told ya girl you know I don't play (OW!)
I wanna put it in your - WHOA girl~!
You better do what the song say

[Chorus: The Hives] + (Timbaland)
Uhh, just throw it on me; uhh, just throw it on me
Uhh, just throw it on me (wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)
Uhh, just throw it on me; uhh, just throw it on me
Uhh, just throw it on me (wiggle that ass before you throw it on me)

[Timbaland]
(Yesssss~!) I got so many broads
white cars I can jump in two or three in the same day
And when I park my car
soon as I walk in the spot women say (OW!)
They ... showin me titties
and they callin my name and all night God damn babe
(SHUT UP!) Niggaz is hatin me
cause they girl wanna throw that thang on me like it's okay
GIRL~!

[Chorus]

[Timbaland]
(Right) When I look at that ass
you probably a "Gold Digger" but I ain't Kanye
Baby girl you're on the right track
but you're goin the wrong way
And when we leave out the party
baby girl I got the game that we gon' play
And when ya wake up tomorrow
I'll be on the highway (peace) HEY!!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Right...
... before you throw it on me
Right - The Hives (just throw it on me)
THE HIVES - JUST THROW IT ON MEEEE~!
Just throw it on meee, just throw it on meeeeeeeeeeeee
(Uh-uhh) Throw it on meeeeeeee, oooh yeahhh
OWWWW~!</pre>
