Song:   I Don't Know Why
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Janet Jackson "Funny How Time Flies (When You're Having Fun)" sample]
Where it all went? Time passed us by
Just when, it seemed, the fun, began

[Chorus: Janet Jackson "Funny How Time Flies (When You're Having Fun)" sample]
Funny, how, time, flies, when, you're, having, fun. ooh baby
Funny, how, time, flies, when, you're, having, fun, oh baby, I don't know why

[Cno Evil]
I love hip hop so much
I don't need to cuss, with rhymes, I bust, but
(But why) Do I love hip hop so much
Is it cuz it's relaxin', causes so much attraction
(But why) Do I love hip hop forever
Or is it just a phase, do I ever get my raise, and
(But why) Do I love hip hop, or does it love me
Was I born with skills, that's why it's so easy?
(But why) Do I love hip hop so much, in a crunch
I can make instrumentals in a bunch and
(But why) Does this beat moan on the track
Makin' love to the drums, put my snare on the hi-hat
(But why) Did I put the bass all in her face
Now mush it all together, she breathes during the space, and
(But to me) Ooooooh, oh my God
I think I just created a brand new song
(Why) Did she say to do it slow?
She likes it from the back, when the drum gently rolls
(But why) Does she love when I spit in the mic
Rophone, all alone, at home, in a zone
(But why) Does time, keep on slippin'
The fun is just beginning, I thought that I was winnin'
(But why) Do I love hip hop, and it's too late
To break away, cuz I was born in that mind state
(But why) Oh my god, I think that I'm in love
Get away from that fool, he's all of the above
(But why) He's in it for the sex, money and drugs
Back away from that fool, before he grabs the glove
(But why) Would he go O.J., on my favorite girl
He thinks of you of as a piece of land
(But to me) but to me, you're a whole world
And in 19 years, you defined that word

[Chorus]

[Li-Mouse]
Aiyo, Cno, send me that new beat you created
Four seconds in, and I already related
Smooth sounds, that'll send chills down your spine
Make you cool when times get tough at the grind
Funny how times flies by when you're having fun
But moves so slow when you're trynna get a bread crumb
Hold up and just, look at your surrounding
Seek the Earth and sky, even if it's corny sounding
Choose paths, with the least resistance
Money grows, on the tree of persistance
Aggression, love, happiness, and fear
Containted in hip hop so, you can hear
How someone like me, is just like you
Going through school, look back to see how I grew
Sunny days, doing research paper
Saying this better get an A, my lord savior
Haha, yeah I'm still going through that
Expectations make it hard, so you sit back
Screw this paper, and forget this class
I hate the teacher, and I ain't never gonna pass
Hold up, guy, and take that deep breath
Minimize MS Word, have fun to relieve stress
Don't put it off for too long though
Come back refreshed, all dressed, so you can resume your flow
Bang out that paper in like an hour or two
File, print, Ok, now you go chill with your crew
You blink twice, and you up on that stage
Square hats and all that, flip the next page
Think back when you was at the desk, all vexed
That one breath, put clarity to the text
New chapter, what will you do next?
Get the career job, receive your fat monthly checks

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
