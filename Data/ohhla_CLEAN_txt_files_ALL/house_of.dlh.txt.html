Looks complicated, huh, but when the sound comes
Significant percussion feel rush crush the round drum
And keep in tempo with the cries of the Ancient
San Su Warrior takin out the plaintiff
This ill crush like skulls in Spain and running bulls
And they gon act like fools when the curtain pulls
This here for partyin' so let your ????? Bong slide
Cruise irie toxins through your head like a G-ride
I hang with macs and Alvarado maniacs
Who make Feria broke backs and Herb sacks
And this right here y'all will be known
As one of the most eloquent ever graced a mic phone
With hype tones my mind roam the ozone
When I'm on the stage known to flow zone
You got a pencil best put it in your pocket
Cause you'll need more than cheap blue ink to rock it

[Chorus 2X]
Cause in the House Of The Rising Drum they all come
You can vibe with the drum so strum or just hum
With a *BBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRR* you best to duck run and hide
You know, yeah

[Ives]
Now I've seen how the world turns and how it functions
I'll be damned if I'm twiced burned before destruction
Cause I could never be that alligator that Albino
Sacrificial wino I got the shoes though with the ill flow
Then I stay two steps ahead three leagues above
The petty individuals sulkin in the masses
Bannin Latin accents then I drop bombs
Napalm square on the flesh and to make it more definitive you won't get rid of this
Your narrow minded attitude will make me rude
Making em capitulate in a civil fashion
I'm old fashion when it comes to body thrashin

[Kemo]
Herb done job cool vibe you all high
Enter through the hale to zone of red eye
Get out your seat it's time to rock show
Frontward backward ill fast or slow oh oh
Time to hit you harder than you all knew
O.G.'s horns a Jericho blew gimme some drums too
Rise your spirit with the Mosh Pit clearin
Know to shake your rear end y'all love what you hearin

[Chorus 2X]
Cause in the House Of The Rising Drum they all come
You can vibe with the drum so strum or just hum
With a *BBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRR* you best to duck run and hide
You know, yeah</pre>
