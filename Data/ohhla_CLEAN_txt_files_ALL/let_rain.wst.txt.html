Chorus
Let it rain make it bang
Niggas in my 'hood sayin'
Fuck everythang
WC (Let it Rain)
Let it rain make it bang
Niggas in my 'hood sayin'
Fuck everythang

WC: Skip skip Connect Gang Connect Gang

Cube
It ain't my fault you wanna C-walk
and gang bang when you hear the G-talk nigga
swing that bitch 'til you break the ball joints
niggas can't see me on this mic or this ballpoint
Papa Don got it locked (got it locked)
with the Glock got ya butt naked to ya socks yayae
The Westside Connect Thugs...
Ain't no California Love just California slugs

Mack 10 <overlaps>
Yo well by popular demand W.S. now I'm back
heat loaded finna jack for another true platinum plaque
It ain't new Westsiders been harder
since Cube had the curl drippin' on the Raider starter (ha ha)
cocked is a must if in heat you trust
now bang the hot hopper 'til all four pumps bust (bust)
Smoke dust then take ten paces
with big bright bows in my flamed phat laces

W.C.
Thunder thunder hot as fire
it's the return of the three kings
Zulu we're the gang bang empire
(singsong)
W.C. the C &amp; B walker conduct the blue chucker
painter pants yep I'm still bangin' on you busters
In the Shark Bar G'd up I got'em nervous
with hoes packin' gats in they candy sprayed purses
Fresh off a 2 piece smelling like a pick
it's that bandana swinger from the number 1 click

Chorus

W.C. (singsong)
Blowed off yak with the W.S. tat'
with the whammy in the back
real riders where you at?

Cube
Bitch, I could give a fuck if you liked me
rollin' with the Mack, Maniac, &amp; W-Shiesty
My nigga just spent a house
on some tinted out, some shit you gotta rent it out
It's time to meet the gorillas
the gangsta the killer &amp; the dope dealers
Mack: (We Go-Rillas!)
Cube: and y'all niggas gon' feel us
and fuck everybody that wanna kill us.

Mack
If it ain't a 64 it's a 6 double 0
foot to the flo' what you want from the sto'?
Bang loose off that act right juice
Ghetto rich niggas sippin' on a deuce-deuce
Fall in &amp; get quoted 'fore the heat get reloaded
Servin' in the 'hood got us all gettin' shorted
kick rocks or pick rocks from the D-dealer
Westside ride against the grain in a three wheeler

W.C.
CONNECT GANG is back ching ching
look at me kickin' 'em with a brand new track ching ching
Call the G's all of the G's!!
Niir please get yo' ass out the chair
throw yo' hands in the air
with the craziest one of my alias no mistaken this
trick don't play with this I'm the Original Shadiest
Stayed in this played in this takin' it back to the days
of gangsters it's sick as they come
Let me know where you from!!!
