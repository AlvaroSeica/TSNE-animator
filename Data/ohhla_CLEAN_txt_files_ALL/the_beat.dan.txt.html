Song:   The Beat
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We're bringing you the beat, yo
It's coming through the back door
You feel it when the beat goes (Boom Boom)
You feel it when the beat goes [x2]

This one ain't about the words, the words, the words, the words
It's all about the beat, the beat, the beat, the beat
This ain't about your brain, your brain, your brain, your brain
It's all about your feet, your feet, your feet, your feet

Miss 'Too cool to move your feet' - (I see you)
Mr 'Dancing as you walk down the street' - (I see you)
Mr 'Tapping your feet at the bar' - (I see you)
Little Miss 'Sing in your car' - (I see you)
Mr 'Cautionary little cynic' - (I see you)
Mr 'Big man in their critic' - (I see you)
Mr 'Loving every beat per minute' - (I see you)
I see, I see, I see, I see all of you.
Mr 'Real music has guitars' - (I see you)
Miss 'Posing online line in your bras' - (I see you)
Mr 'I can't understand what he's saying' - (I see you)
Mr "Inappropriate for daytime playing - (I see you)
Miss 'Covered in emotional scars' - (I see you)
Mr 'Gazing in the gutter at stars' - (I see you)
Mr 'What kinda genre is this?' - (I see you)
I see, I see, I see, I see through you</pre>
