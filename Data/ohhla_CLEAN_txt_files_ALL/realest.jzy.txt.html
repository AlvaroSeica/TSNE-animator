[Intro]
Ride on these niggas
I ride on these niggas (yeah)
I ride on these niggas (hahaaa)
I ride on these niggas
Let's get it!

[Verse 1]
Super charger, the same color as PJ
I got a champagne range
Big niggas off, I got a night-scope aim
Audio video, you caught on tape
That's a way to get ya ass sent upstate
And not a {*edited*}, I took them trips down to Lauderdale
Back and Forth like Aaliyah
Chance of gettin rich is like one in a million
Or more like two in a billion
Flashin lights, my mind's playin tricks on me
But the minuteman still do tricks homie
Swear the Feds just starin at a nigga
You know the feelin, your heart fall to ya feet
Summertime niggas still ridin with heat
Jeezy De Niro, Snowman Pacino
Real niggas love me because I talk that lingo

[Hook]
{*X2*}
And I'm the muh'fuckin realest
They liars, they phonies, they fakes
These niggas ain't never sold the weight

{*X2*}
And I'm the muh'fuckin realest
They liars, they phonies, they fakes
These niggas ain't never touched the weight

And I'm the muh'fuckin realest

[Verse 2]
Nowadays the GT's Glock black
The shoes on that muh'fucker three-eighty chrome
Gotta be careful what you say on the phone
I'm thirty-six souls away
From givin the mic up and goin back to the streets
What's the difference? I still eat the same
A nigga paranoid, I still sleep the same
And niggas rappin bout blow like it's a fad
Nigga, this my life, I ain't tryna set trends
Cause everybody knows how that brick road ends
Heartless, maybe I need to see the wizard
Until then I'ma make it snow blizzards

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I stood on that block and risked my life
Day in and day out until a nigga sold out
You niggas playin, I show you what that street shit bout
Hit you right up with them thangs and come back with the chains
Might cook it in the stove, might cook it in the microwave
Either way it's gonna sell, still weigh it on the scale
You rappin ass niggas ain't never sold no yams
I'm talkin sucker free Sundays and iced out Mondays
Pin up Tuesdays and body tap Wednesdays
You was in the studio, I was on the block
In the kitchen at the spot goin hard with the blocks
Twenty-five for the four ways, choppers by the doorways
