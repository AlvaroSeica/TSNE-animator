[Kanye West - Intro]
Party people in the place to be
You are now in the midst of a real emcee
Throw your hands in the air if you real as me
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHWWHHOOOOOOOOO~!!!!

[Charlie Wilson] (Kid Cudi)
Uh, uh
La, la, laaaah
La la la-la-lah
La la la-la-lah
They say, ahhhhh
(Are you...)
La, la, laaaah
(...ready to go?)
La la la-la-lah
(I know the city gettin ready for me)
La la la-la-lah
(I know the city gettin ready for me)

[Kanye West] 
Such an easy mornin, we on a ride
And I'm feelin smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down, if they playin that bullshit
They don't want black people think at trial

[Common]
He think he live, he think he cold
He think I'm high, I'm in thinker mode
Eyes low, I let the skies hold the thoughts
The streets are like the high road that I go across, uh

[Kanye West] (Kid Cudi)
I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that it's fashion week
And the weather wasn't barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music, yeah forever we hot (Are you...)
Motherfucker, are you ready or not? (...ready to go?)

[Kid Cudi]
I know the city gettin ready for me
I know the city gettin ready for me
Are you...
...ready to go?
I know the city gettin ready for me
I know the city gettin ready
Are you...
...ready to go?
I know the city gettin ready for me
I know the city gettin ready

[Kanye West]
This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop
(Can't stop! Yooooooou can't STOP!)
This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop
(Can't stop! Yooooooou can't STOP!)

[Pusha T]
As 'Ye flips the piano
The mood swings like the change of a channel
He's heatin up like they wrapped him in flanel
Sellin kilo's through your iPod nano
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal
Money drive me crazy look at Marbury's handle
Vaseline face reminiscin of my tires
Ice cream paint job somethin like Breyers
Euro tank top, Dior inspired
Sell it to you hard no assembly required
EYUGH! I'm 2012 in 2010
Which makes this a time machine not just any biz
Floss with the members of the gang with twenty eight
While, haters wish death pon me that's many men
YEAH! If he slangin on your paper route
Stop talkin mothersucker move your paper out!!!

[Charlie Wilson] (Kid Cudi) {Big Sean}
Ahhhhh (Are you...)
La, la, laaaah
(...ready to go?)
La la la-la-lah
(I know the city gettin ready for me)
La la la-la-lah
(I know the city gettin ready for me)
Lemme hear you say, ahhhhh (Are you...)
La, la, laaaah
(...ready to go?) {Smokin on dat...}
La la la-la-lah
(I know the city gettin ready for me)
{Chokin on dat...} La la la-la-lah
(I know the city gettin ready for me)

[Big Sean]
Now tell me do it feel goooooood? Well, all RIGHT
Don't worry, we gon' be here all NIGHT
Now you know a nigga rep that Westsiiiiide (Westside!)
Westsiiiiide, West-SIDE!
So t-t-tell me who the freshest of 'em ALL?
They claimin that they fresh, they ain't fresher than my BALLS~!
A nigga suited fresh like I'm headed to the ball
Emcee huntin season, puttin heads up on the wall
I sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft
Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawls
I guess that's why in school, my grades went from As' to Bs' to Cs'
All over double Ds' I be absent all week
This is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for
Man, that's the fam, we let 'em in through the side door
...Hold on, that's the girl you gave a wedding ring?
Man, me and my niggas nutted on her everything
Haha!

[Charlie Wilson]
And lemme hear you say, ahhhhhh
La, la, laaaah
La la la-la-lah
La la la-la-lah
Lemme hear you say say, ahhhhh
La, la, laaaah
La la la-la-lah
La la la-la-lah

[Kanye West]
Ay, we promised
Now put your hands up to the sky
Until the day in that we die
Uh, and we'll be here all evening
G.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend
