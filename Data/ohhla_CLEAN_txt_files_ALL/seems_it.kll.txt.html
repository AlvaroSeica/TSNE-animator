Song:   Seems it Never Fails
Typed by: TFLthuG@aol.com

[Chorus]
It seems it never fail (x3)
that the devils got niggaz domes locked in hell
so return to the darkside 
snakes are the niggaz that stares you in the eyes
death is a penalty when you die

[Islord]
blood seaks out ya right eye
the war against the brain 
the mad pain will be felt
watch da sun the rain expert through his own work
Islord choppin' his way up to Billboard 
the top notch I got mc's gatherin' sold their life
similiar to Fort Knox 
Lyrical shots and shot rap and fire style
Killarmy Profilin' mostly buck whilin'
at the click put it to ten max
to the up most niggaz is ghost's
on the first lyrical dose
that'll wreck ya brain like uncooked cocaine
str-8 from the crates of the cocoa click
niggaz chant Killarmy from Bronx Don Juan

[Chorus]
It seems it never fail (x3)
that the devils got niggaz domes locked in hell
so return to the darkside 
snakes are the niggaz that stares you in the eyes
death is a penalty when you die

[9th Prince]
Let me survive after the fully moon
facin' changed said
lettin' oracles of oracle man
solid liquid and gas
I became an Ill fad and cryin' of shame
and heal the pain of less of my name
and taggin' on the wall
bited and blood stains 
'til the whole world can see
the reality of a madess conspiracy
dark heavens slangin' in chemical smoke
and hold ya breath or death 
if not ya choke and 
speak that what preachers will say
I gash him to pieces when he comes my way
blood is worser to the storm 
and the singers I jacked 
who are going to die perhaps
I sang watchin' men through the valleys again
then I spin into a circle of wind
which is a tornado or I'm dangerous
like David Caress of Waco 
to wake up the ammo
Killarmy dipped in green like deniro

[Chorus]
It seems it never fail (x3)
that the devils got niggaz domes locked in hell
so return to the darkside 
snakes are the niggaz that stares you in the eyes
death is a penalty when you die</pre>
