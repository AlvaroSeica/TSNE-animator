Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I thought maybe I'd find a friend
Or maybe I'd meet a girl
Have a great conversation with a stranger
On the other side of the world

Or maybe learn something new
About a culture or a place
Connect with another human being
But every time I press new game

All I see is
Guys jerking off
Guys jerking off
Just penises and cocks
And guys jerking them off

Hold on
This guy's not jerking off
Maybe he's like me
And he just wants to talk
Hi, how are you?

"Nope, there he goes
Uh, dude, that is a lot of cum"</pre>
