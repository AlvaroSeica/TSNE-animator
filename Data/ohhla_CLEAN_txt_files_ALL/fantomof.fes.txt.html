[Fes Taylor]
Yo, catch 'em in Williamsburg, I might kill his bird
It's kinda like Revenge of the Nerds
You niggas is turds, I flush on niggas
Over a couple of figures, that's my word
Thirty grand make a nigga switch plans
Realize that ya man trynna get you a scam
My gun don't jam, it drum roll beer
All they saw was an unknown man, Taylor Conan
Both hands squeezing his throat glands, squeezing like coke cans
Fresh Air Fund seasonal program
We the reason they even know fam
He was Blue Cheesing it, eating off old jams
And we ain't get paid for shit
Kinda like what a slave would get, shit
I'm bout to get my Suge Knight on
Pull my hammer out the drawer, throw my hoodie right on
I hang a nigga from the terrace
He looking like food all I need is a beverage
Thirsty to pull the trigger, first we was niggas
Now I think about how to dump the nigga in the river
Funny how money change close friends
Brand new attitude, laying low in the Benz
Fuck a freestyle, everything cost a fee now
Like paper for my lawyer, in case I see trial
Took a bow like Rihanna, I made a promise
To my old earth, I'mma be all that I can be, mama
You see karma's a muthafucka, it's Tony Tucker
I don't take ya bitch on dates, I only fuck her
These old school niggas is fucking washed up
I Tide Clorox niggas, so homey squash what
If I don't get every dollar of my bread
I'mma send the rottweilers for ya head, muthafucka</pre>
