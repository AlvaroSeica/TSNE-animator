[Juelz Santana]
Okay, checkit-checkit-check it out
It's Santan-er again steppin'-steppin',steppin' out, up
One of them brand new big boy toys
I do big boy things, I make big boy noise 'cause
(*singing*)I know what girls want, (want) I know what they like (like)
They wanna stay up ('EY), and party all night
So bring a friend

[Chris Brown - Verse 1]
Let me talk to you, tell you how it is
I was thinkin' when I saw that body, gotta get shawty
Tell her what the young boy gon do
Damn them chicks witchu, gotta be okay
Babe pretty thick wit the kick that's sick that need to be hit
So tell me what y'all gon do

[Hook 2X]
I got friends, and you got friends
They hop out, and you hop in
I look fly, and they jock-in'
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop

[Chorus]
Is ya MAN (MAN) on the FLO'? (FLO')
If he AIN'T (AIN'T), lemme KNOW! (KNOW)
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl indeed I can run it, run it
Is ya MAN (MAN) on the FLO'? (FLO')
If he AIN'T (AIN'T), lemme knoo-ow!
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl indeed I can run it, run it

[Verse Two]
(C'MERE!!) You'll see, girl I can set you off
Don't believe, my age is gonna slow us do-own
I can definitely show you things
To have you sayin' I can't be sixteen
Once I, get in, you won't wanna go
(and I...)
I'll have, yo' girls, wishin' they were you
(and I...)
I know your heard about me, but guess what's goin' down if we leave

[Hook 2X and chorus]

[Bridge]
(Let's go) Girl you feel right (feel right)
Make me feel like... (feel like...)
I wanna do a little somethin'  (do a little somethin' tonight)
Ain't no thing let you do it fo SHO'
Girl the way that your wearin' them jeans is turnin me on
I'm the hottest thing that's in these streets (Dipset)
So baby won't you rock, me...

[Juelz Santana]
Make it drop honey, make it pop honey
Whip whop, tick-tock to the clock for me
Don't stop doin that, and shawty know I MEAN what I say
So she won't stop doin' dat
Plus I heard if you can dance, you can bump
Well dance time is up! Let's go, let's go (yup)
We can get it in, (yup) we can get some friends
Do it like the Ying Yang Twinz, start whisperin'
(*whispers*)
Wait til' you see my...'EY! Wait til' you see my...'EY!
Let me fall back, you ain't ready for all that
Have you sleep late, real late, yeah takin' a long nap ('EY!)
You tell your friends, to get wit my friends
We could be friends, switch and meet friends (SWITCH)
We can do it all night long and, til' the clock hit mornin', ya dig?

[Chorus and ad-libs 'til fade]</pre>
