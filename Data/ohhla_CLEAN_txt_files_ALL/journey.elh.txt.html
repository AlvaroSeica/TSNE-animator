Herrrre we goooooo, across the laaaand
Herrrre we goooooo, on a jour-ney agaaaain
Herrrre we goooooo, hannnnd in hannnnd (here we gooooo...)
Herrrre we goooooo (on a journey againnnnn, ohh-ohhhh)
Herrrre we goooooo, across the laaaand (across the land)
Herrrre we goooooo (on a journey)
On a jour-ney agaaaain
Herrrre we goooooo, hannnnd IN HANNNND!!!

Here we go-ohhhhhh
Across the land
