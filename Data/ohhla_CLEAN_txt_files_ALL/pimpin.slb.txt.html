[Hook - 2x]
I know these boppers, steady calling me
Since I'm a pimp, I let em know that I don't fuck for free
I threw the top off my slab, and swang it like a G
Click the remote to my trunk, and now I'm looking clean

[Bridge - 2x]
Boppers steady calling my phone
Won't leave me alone, I'm riding on chrome
And this a habit, I'ma be a playa for life
That's shining so bright, I'm creeping at night
I gotta have it

[Trae]
Hop aside of my dropper top, or this classified half-a-slabber
If a bopper be riding my dick, it's guaranteed I'm grab her
Superstar like the Fat Pat, swanging off in a black Lac
Spitting game and I got that, run up in and get out that
Ain't no kissing and hugging, no rubbing no loving hoes
My mission is to get with em, and then I'ma be fucking hoes
Tag teaming with Yung Redd, too much game so we going FED
The only way for these hoes to see us, is if they coming off bread
Why let you fuck me for free, so you can get a reputation
Better get your hoe chance up out my face, or a backhand you gon be facing
Late night and crawling the slab, and loading up the block
I'm a playa forever, and my game I'm setting up

[Yung Redd]
These hoes saying Yung Redd, ain't nothing nice
Whatever the price, I keep wearing yellow ice
I'm top notch from my shoes from my shuns, to my socks
Cause Redd in a drop, don't usually stop or wait
I coming up, man I can't let these hoes, take me under
And I don't need to know your name, fuck your phone number
You see me in the street, I'm spending money er-y week
Talk is cheap, and most niggaz ain't street
Go ask them hoes in the hood, yeah they know me well
I hit the block, so the spot and get a cop tail
Ain't hard to tell, my money too long to fail
Now when my solo drop, you know it's gon sell

[Hook - 2x]

[Jay'Ton]
I was blessed to get the game, so I give it back to em
Run up in em flossing and tossing, so much it be amusing
Laid back and recline, while I'm checking my palm pilot
With my hand on the wheel, looking like a pimp when I glide it
Tinted up so I'm private, trying to get away from the boppers
Creeping they neighborhood, late night on don't-stoppers
I'm a T-H-U-G, repping S.L.A.B
Riding B-L-U-E, in a B-U-I-C
K with Trae, and we dubbing it out the roof
With diamonds on every tooth, and you know that we bopper proof
Never gon be tricking change, on a nothing-ass hoe
I'ma hit it and quit it, and that's the way the game go

[Lil B]
What you know about a P-I, M to the P
I'm a player baby girl, I can't fuck you hoes for free
Acting like you my girlfriend, blowing up my cell phone
Keep it real you just fronting, trying to ride on my pone'
That's why I stay one deep on the creep, I ride solo
Fa sho hoe, I know you wanna fuck this fo' do'
But no, I push my roof back, and pop my trunk open
Swanging down your block, glass and 84's poking
Choking you hoes and haters, a playa that's me
Silly bitch you thought you played, L-I-L to the B
But I'm a G, think about it we ain't fucking for free
Cut you loose, now I got all kinda boppers calling me
