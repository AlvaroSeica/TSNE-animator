[Verse 1 - Pegz and Muph]
P: 	I'm not ready for marriage, sex with a nanny
	Having affairs with friends of the family
	I know a lot of hardcore heads understand me
	That life as an artist is forever demanding
	I can't handle the pressure of planning
	Checking your arse like retina scanning
M:	Hey yo, calm down, this is what I wanted
	Be happy for me, I found a girl who's on it
	This is my life, feels right to make the promise
P: 	Maaan, I think I'm gonna vomit
	Little gromits, bring pain, shrink wallets
	I'm only trying to spit honest and kick knowledge
M: 	I'm not concerned with the size of my pockets
P: 	So how you gonna provide, with ya profits
M: 	You still ain't got it, we both got jobs
	2006 and there ain't no boss
	Work half as hard and halve the costs
	Safe as an Armaguard parking spot
P: 	Fourteen years of relationships
	And I don't believe shit like an atheist
	I want to wake up, party with a Baywatch body
	Not wake up grumpy with a brain that's throbbing
M: 	I wanna make love, to favourite honey
	Hold her in my hands like Australian currency
	Study her like a book, that's mine for good
P: 	I'ma study her from behind and inside the hood

[Hook x2 - Pegz and Muph]
So come on!
We could be happily married
Come on!
This ain't Harry met Sally
Come on!
There's something that you need to know
Leave it alone, it's each to their own

[Verse 2 - Muph]
I found something sweet to keep
You'll be old and bitter, wishing you were me
Accompanied by crabs and other STD's
Top it all off you'll catch Ben Lee's disease
Please, no matter how strong
You can't replace the male and female bond
How long can you con a girl out of a skirt?
Before you come across a loss that actually hurts
Too much work to insert for no reward
Besides if I like I could always get divorced
Beautiful law, the net for safety
While you're on your drought, I'm getting laid daily
Cause I know one brother who never got hitched
Now he's living like shit
And I know one brother who never took a risk
Now he's constantly pissed

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Pegz] (+ Muph)
No honey, yes honey, please honey get something
Don't forget milk and bread, saving the rent money
You wanna take her for the day's food
I wanna take her just to *fuck* in the change room
You wanna, get clucky like Donald Duck
You gonna, get screwed like Donald Trump
Cause I know you're in love but it's not enough
I've seen a lot of good couples go bottom up
Yo Muph! Let me ask you a question
Is your father at all mafia connected?
Cause I know brother used to cheat on his misses
Now he... Sleeps with the fishes
(Yeah I know one brother used to treat em like bitches
Now he... Sleeps with the fishes)
Yo bro I ain't doubting your faith
We got a thousand tour dates and an album to make

[Hook x2]

[Repeat x2]
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
There's something that you need to know
Leave it alone, it's each to there own

[Outro]
M: 	Well I just want to settle you know, stress free
	So I can more music for once
P: 	Well tell me how fucking stress free it is?
M: 	Yeah it's not very stress free
But anyway, you know, its worth it man
P: 	Oh bullshit
M: 	Yeah it's worth it
I'll wear me stubby shorts, and me ahh, me thongs
P: 	I'll wear me fucking funeral suit
Hahahaha</pre>
