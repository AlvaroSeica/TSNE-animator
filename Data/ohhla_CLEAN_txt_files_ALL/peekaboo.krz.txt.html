[Krizz Kaliko]
Hahaha, peek-a-boo. I see you. Hahaha. Aww
What's the matter? You don't love me anymore?
Hahaha. Peek-a-boo niggas. Yea. I see ya
Big Krizz Kaliko, baby. Kali baby. Twiztid, Prozak
Yea. Strange Music and Psychopathic holdin' down the underground
Still

Like this...

It ain't over when ya think it's exonerated, gonna hate it,
It's all on sight and ya think I ain't the type
Right
And Christmas ain't enough to make Krizz miss
Hit em in the middle of em turn em into Swiss Miss this
Too hard to turn back when it's irreconcilable,
Tempers is volatile and you feel you got violence all bottled up
I'm a sum it up
I'm a change my angle from an angel to gettin niggas runnin up
Ain't a gangsta, a soldier but thanks to ignorant niggas now I got a chip on my shoulda
It started when the, 80's, baby went, crazy, maybe been, hades, but I'm heaven sent
See it on my face I'm a saint, that don't mean I can't go real hard in the paint
My mind at a place but with medicine I'll be much better in a week or two, if not peek-a-boo

[Chorus]
Peek-a-boo. I see you. Tell me what you're gonna do (PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo. You see me. Standing right in front of you (I SEE YOU!)
Peek-a-boo. I see you. Now it comes right back to you (PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo. Okay, go. [?] (I SEE YOU!)

[Prozak]
Yo, some say my candle burns at both ends
Insanity in my brain stems
I think these are the reasons I have no friends
You begin to choke and, ya blood get soaked in
I leave ya dizzy like that bitch Lindsey Lohan
There ain't no hope man, go straight to the throat, damn!
Prozak and Kaliko, Twiztid, here come the horsemen
Always stay renegade, the solo killa
warfare gorilla, hitchcock, they call me prozilla
So peep da promise cause lyrics so diabolical
I'll leave ya brain matter splattered with hair folicles
Behold the prophecies before I am done
I shall leave a wake of destruction and follow the sun
All hail the omnious one
who went to prom with a gun and now they're screamin and runnin
But now it's time for the fun
Careful never to cross a man when ya don't know what he goin through
Prozak, psychopath, bitch, peek-a-boo

[Chorus]
Peek-a-boo. I see you. Tell me what you're gonna do (PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo. You see me. Standing right in front of you (I SEE YOU!)
Peek-a-boo. I see you. Now it comes right back to you (PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo. Okay, go. [?] (I SEE YOU!)

[Twiztid]
I'm sicka than most folks who say they mind twisted
Like chrome and goatspokes, pop hoes like yodos
I'm hunting motherfuckers down in nightmares
Prepare for the chance to be nare and get your life spared
Fight fair? Never, not me, fuck with the wrong cat
(? What your big dog flee on?)
Bad news like teen pregnency and you know at the second you say some shit
[?]
But tell em death wannna ya
(We club) Ferocious
The Earth die screaming invaded by cockroaches and [?]

[Chorus]
Peek-a-boo. I see you. Tell me what you're gonna do (PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo. You see me. Standing right in front of you (I SEE YOU!)
Peek-a-boo. I see you. Now it comes right back to you (PEEK-A-BOO!)
Peek-a-boo. Okay, go. [?] (I SEE YOU!)</pre>
