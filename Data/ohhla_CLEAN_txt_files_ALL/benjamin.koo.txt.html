(Singing)
Let's take a trip to the clubs on the north-side (On the north-side)
Really doesn't matter (Really doesn't matter)

Let's take a trip to the clubs on the south-side (On the south-side)
Really doesn't matter (Really doesn't matter)
I be pimpin (As long as ya ready for)

(Hook [Koopsta])
The benjamins and the g-strings
[Who's in the cliz-ub]
[Don't know me, show me liz-ove]
Those benjamins and the g-strings
[Gold teeth to the tooth-uhhh]
[For the ones who scoped-uuuss]
Those benjamins and the g-strings
[Ma-mafi-ma-mafi-ya!]
[Ma-mafi-ma-mafi-ya-ya!]
Those benjamins and the g-strings
[Ten, twenty sonic nation]
[Muh'fuckin funny]

(Verse 1)
Starin, doesnt know da bometo
In return I know she scopin out this negro
Man this loco, just cinco mi juevos
And that Koopsta gon' tell you how the story goes
Man, them hoes gotta make them a livin
So you cheap niggas need to start tippin
Come closer, got plenty tens and twenties
Got some' for me? Quickly breakin out them hundreds
In her bikini, I just quickly start slidin
Them benjamins in my hand, started grippin
Now it's nothin but a novelty, gettin close to me
Coochie, to the T, 'finna do it like a G
Man that D.P.B., pass me anotha
Not that cheap shit, that pure, or Moet-ahh
As the DJ started mixin Three 6 Mafia
Now the hoes begin to holla, err-eh-err-eh (Koopstaaaa!)
Said enough, I know you niggas think I'm trickin
But I ain't trippin, straight up dickin on these bitches
And as a leader, V.I.P, see the pimps lookin funny, sayin
(Bitch betta have my money!)
I'm ready fo'

(Verse 2)
I like them pretty bitches
Spanish bitches, black ass bitches, Latin bitches
Different origin bitches that sucks up on a nigga dick-ey!
"Your dick so good, where you get that from?" is what she say
From makin and bumpin good mix with that muh'fuckin Triple man
Yeah, a different text
She workin with that, so freaky with this
I'm knockin the skin up off of you to rest
Come near, come near, come see the Koopsta wipe his tears
I do think positive when someone cares of how I feel
I'm not that good enoouugh
Cause my hearts been brooo-keeen
Now that I'm doin goo-oood
Now she wanna give me one more chaaance
Most bitches don't understaaand
That I once was a gentlemaaaan
Oh, I hope you can comp-errr-heeend
That the Koopsta came here to staaay
No more bein in love for ya kills
Best ta watch yaself (Watch yaself)
Feels good, bein free
Got the Koopsta singin ohh welll (Ohhh welll)
