[Intro]
Break it down c'mon!
Yeah, yeah, yeah c'mon

[Rhymefest]
Hop in
For a ride in my whip
No friends
Just you and a kid
Let's spin
Till we dizzy as shit
Takin' a trip
Me and you makin' a hit
Slow down
Don't get ahead of yourself
Go down
I got some head for myself
Profound
I'm like water in Hell, coolin' you off
Dousin', makin' it soft
Wait
This ain't jail
Go and put the bars down
Realize that you rollin' with a star now
Let's start now
I'll let you browse the web and we can shop all day
Go get the cart now
Uh
I had to get some swagger back
A lot of MC's need to get your talent back
Matter fact, get a job, you ain't gotta rap
Work at J-Records, here's my album, package that
Thank you, now I'm advancin'
Out on the floor with your chick for ransom and we...

(Dancin', dancin', dancin')
What your girlfriend is
(She's a dancin' machine)
Back it up now
Back it up now
Back it up now
Back it up now
(Dancin', dancin', dancin')
What your girlfriend is
(She's a dancin' machine)
Back it up now
Back it up now
Back it up now
Back it up now
(She's a dance, dance, dance, dancin' machine
Watch her get down, watch her get down
As she do, do, do, do her thing right on the scene)
In the club in the club in the club
(She's a dance, dance, dance, dancin' machine
Watch her get down, watch her get down
As she do, do, do, do her thing right on the scene)
She's a...yeah</pre>
