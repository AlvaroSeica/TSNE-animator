(Rambo (2008) sample)
You know what you are... what you're made of. War is in your blood.
When you're pushed, killing's as easy as breathing.

(Intro)
Cocksucker, yeah, uh-huh, this how we do it
Fuck 'em in their mouth; make 'em love that fucking cock
Introduce 'em to that Terrorist shit
Make 'em never forget it
Make 'em not understand the plan
A new man, and damn
The rebirth

[Dom Pachino]
Yo, yo
I treat the game like my day job
I spray slobs with pig juice
Watch 'em blow, I rigged you
I'm the flame, you're the igloo
If you grow, I'll stick you
I stuck you, so fuck you
I touch crews and eat 'em like lunch food
I'll treat 'em like BK
My heat spray, yo check out my DJ
I'm back like an instant replay
Giving you just what you wanted
The Terrorist that you love to hate
But never fronted
Stay blunted like '99, now I just drink wine
And let them things off like Columbine
My mind stays awake like a freight
Lock ya gates, close ya doors and windows
We climb balconies
On a top of a building just like a falcon be
Or that nigga who killed Malcolm, X Y and Z
Three things you shouldn't fuck with
Guns, drugs and P
Three niggas that I run with, Medal, Bugs and Veto-P
Shout to my nigga OC, the whole Napalm family
Nigga and Tera Iz Me
This era is L-O-C-K-E-D
By a nigga like P, got lyrics for weeks
If I started now, it be couple of days 'fore I sleep
One eye open, gun toten
Try to creep I'll leave 'em floating
Smoking like that crack coking
Nigga, my hits are potent, ambidextrous
With mics, and hammers in both hands
Cut niggas and slice grams
Like Ghost I fuck fans too
And they could be a fan of the Wu
I'll have your bitch on her knees screaming "Su"
For put me lyrically nigga, you must be dreaming dude
I'm ravishing, I'll embarrass 'em, they'll look like foods
And every seven line, there's a jewel
If you catch it, it's all up to you, to you

(Keith Olbermann sample)
Theoretically, at least it is clear that both terrorists and governments
supposedly hunting terrorists, have motives
Both of them have motives, to keep people afraid
Terrorists after all do not just want us or anybody dead
Fear is often even a better end result</pre>
