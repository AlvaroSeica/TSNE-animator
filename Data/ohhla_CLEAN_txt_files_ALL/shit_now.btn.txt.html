Magnum!

[Juju]
My glock will make the whole fucking block rumble
Y'all niggaz need to watch who you approach in this jungle
See I ain't even got a pot to piss, watchin you homo niggaz pop that Crys
Drop by me hangin out that rich
See if a nigga don't chop it off
Y'all niggaz talk too much shit, y'all need to knock it off
Catch your mom comin off of the train
Put an ice-pick in the back of her brain, its that plain
I want everything or nothing at all
Give your (smash) a whatcha-ma-call
I give love when I shop at the mall
They always at your throat or down at your feet
Always actin like something is sweet
You don't know me homey
I'm lifeless, always gettin caught in a crisis
The only way out now is to write this
Everybody kiss my ass, cause I'm only flying business class
So if you can't afford it nigga, don't ask

If it ain't Psycho, its Juju, and if it ain't Juju it's Psycho
Who's comin' wit tha shit now!
If it ain't Juju, its Psycho, and if it ain't Psycho it's Juju
Who's comin' wit tha shit now!

[Psycho Les]
Ayo, niggaz wanna ban me like dice play
So I grab my nuts and tell 'em have a nice day
They wanna hate on me all day, talk shit like its okay
And my reply is no way Jose
You poppin so much 'dro I'm bout to say olay
We drop the illest joints, that gets no play
All these industry cats, can't stop the funk
So hit the deck when I turn this up and pop the trunk
And circulate, the state, like a trolly-car
And peep the party, people's hands up like volley-ball
It's Big Psych, makin big money stacks
Retaliate on you funny cats wit murder tracks

Like if it ain't Psycho, its Juju, and if it ain't Juju it's Psycho
Who's comin' wit tha shit now!
If it ain't Juju, its Psycho, and if it ain't Psycho it's Juju
Who's comin' wit tha shit now!

[Willie Stubz]
Head bob to the beat, put some rocks at your feet
On the block with a fleet, bass rattles the concrete
Spit heat like the summer, let it clap like thunder
I'm always in and out of the hood, politicin what's good
Let my pen write on paper, party in the skyscraper
Who's the amazing, Willie Stubz blazin the hazin
Hot like the mutha fuckin hell that I be raising
Pimp shorty short be like please don't deport me
My life story's well, I'm just out to get the glory
Three heavy-weights, on the tripple-beam
Its seems don't every pre-judge
They finally decompose in the mud
Willie Stubz and Beatnuts, Beatnuts and Willie Stubz
Hoping for the new shit, exclusive we bombin
Killer instincts alarming now who the fuck you harming
We formin like the five boroughs, this joints thorough
Officials that's why we gonna shine like crystal (bling)

You requested it, so we rewind

Who's comin' wit tha shit now! (repeated)</pre>
