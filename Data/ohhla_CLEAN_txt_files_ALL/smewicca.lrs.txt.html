Typed by: @mc_lars (Horris Records)

Five foot two with that Celtic tattoo
Straight out the coven with her hair died blue
Polytheistic, no pagan can deny this
I found her in the backyard praying to Osiris
I asked her for her name, she calmly said Antigone
I knew from her mood ring that homegirl must be digging me
We talked about morality, if she was big on bigamy
She said that's just the Mormons and then she got all giggly
Take a black pentagram, flip it on its back
That's how she gets down, Wicca like that
Take a black pentagram, flip it on its back
That's how she rolls 'cause she's Wicca like that

[CHORUS]
Something Wicca this way comes
Something Wicca (Wicca, Wicca) this way comes
Something Wicca this way comes
Something Wicca (Wicca, Wicca) this way comes

Earth, water, wind and sun
Screw eHarmony, she's the one

She's got a book of spells and a python named Apollo
She calls it her familiar but I find that hard to swallow
I ask her what's for dinner, she consults the tarot cards
Full scale Stonehenge model chilling in the front yard
When the moon is full we go dancing in the woods
Our pentacles get tangled but it feels so good
No need for cable, every time we get board
We're hollering at Bacchus on a Wal-Mart Ouija board
And we take a black pentagram, flip it on its back
That's how we get down, Wicca like that
Make a magic circle, I'll flip her on her back
That's how we roll 'cause we're Wicca like that

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Earth, water, wind and sun
I never knew witchcraft was so much fun
Earth, water, wind and sun
ScrewMatch.com 'cause she's the one

What will people think when they hear that I'm a Wicca freak
What will people do when they find out it's true?
I don't really care if they label me a Wicca freak
There ain't no disguising the truth

And we take a black pentagram, flip it on its back
That's how we get down, Wicca like that
take a black pentagram, flip it on its back
That's how we roll 'cause we're Wicca like that
And I treat her like pentagram, flip her on her back
That's how we get down, Wicca like that
I treat her like pentagram, flip her on her back
Pierced to the max like a chick from the Craft</pre>
