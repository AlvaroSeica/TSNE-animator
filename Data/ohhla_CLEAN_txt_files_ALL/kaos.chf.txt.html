[Intro: Buddha Monk]
That's the sound, of the chimes coming in
It's the Freaky Fuckin' Weirdos and the Brooklyn Zu
Buddha Monk and Popa Chief, yeah

[Buddha Monk]
If it's a life of full salvetry, and the devil still laugh at me
I drink Bacardi then set the mind free, puff trees and I watch TV
And chaos, get off my back, you can't touch this
I'm coming through with the Brooklyn Zu and the Freaky Fuckin' Weirdos to
I mean this, you better watch out for these styles
We'll be choppin' through your areas and swinging through your town
It's chaos, you can't touch this fucking style
I mean everybody out there, you better listen to it now
I freeze those flows, and the flows that don't fucking freeze
You better listen to me, cuz I'm choppin' down all your trees
And I mean this, and I'm coming through your town all the time
To let you know that chaos is still on my mind

[Chorus: Freaky Fuckin' Weirdos]
Ooh, ahh, eeh, chaos

[Interlude: Popa Chief]
Do you understand me?
Do you see Popa Chief?
It's two people

[Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs]

[Interlude: Popa Chief]
This is the combination of two fast flows
Brooklyn Zu and the Freaky Fuckin' Weirdos
Brooklyn Zu, the Freaky Fuckin' Weirdos
Brooklyn Zu, the Freaky Fuckin' Weirdos
Brooklyn Zu, the Freaky Fuckin' Weirdos
Brooklyn Zu, the Freaky Fuckin' Weirdos
Brooklyn Zu, the Freaky Fuckin' Weirdos, chaos

[Popa Chief]
Come and be habitual, to all the hoes that's in the hand
Picking you, picking tonight, understand?
Box his nose, deserve a crave of Brooklyn Zu approach
Bottoms up, Popa Chief propose a toast
Salute, if you nice with George, lock and load
Cock and shoot, it don't get no harder than 200 proof
Caviar raw, pushing through like a dirty syringe
It's chaos, MC's is caught up in sin
Me? I hit mics from the back, buck buck tracks
Put me in any situation, I'll adapt
Reppin', Brooklyn Zu, til it's time to go
I'm Freaky, I'm Fuckin', so I guess I'm a Weirdo

[Chorus 3X w/ ad-libs]

[Interlude: Popa Chief]
Can you feel it? I mean can you feel what I'm saying
Chaos... I know I'm a weirdo, man, I know, I know
I know, but see what ya'll don't know
I wish my other Zu brothers were here
I wish my other Zu brothers was here
I wish my other Zu brothers was here
I wish my other Zu brothers was here
See Weirdo, just means, that you're different
And they cannot understand, what they don't know
They just different, see what I'm saying
That's all being a Weirdo, mean
You see, this is weird, weird, and we all come together
And form one big weirdo.. the Brooklyn Zu and the Freaky Fuckin' Weirdos
You knowhatim talking bout, it's chaos...
Do you understand me? Total pure..

[Popa Chief]
Chaos, mayhem, total, destruction
Annihilation, to start the revolution
Big up if you with me, one rule if you ain't
When the chaos starts, I'm holding it down in the paint
Think I'm not, when I am, don't eat, ham or spam
London Bridge is falling down, suck my dick in the dam
Good versus evil, down to do the shame to devil
Take it up another notch, just take it up another level
Light up the sky, like the 4th of July
If I'm not getting drunk, I'm somewhere getting high

[Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs]

[Outro: Popa Chief]
Zu brings the chaos...</pre>
