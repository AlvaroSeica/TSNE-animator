[Verse One: Trick Daddy]
I'm well connected, well respected for gangsta shit
I'm from the city of Caprices and Impalas bitch
Yo I'm from down the way, you know, around the way
Dade Country, trey-oh-five, rep the whole M-I-A

Look here, shit real, we really get it how we live
We get on heavy krill, we get on heavy pills
Me and my niggaz and my Cubans and my Haitians dem
Bitch I'm from Dade County, we go way harder
We do it way bigger, cause we some made niggaz
Born bred and raised in gettin money ways
Cause they don't get it off the top like we get it down in Dade, hey

[Chorus]
"Bitch I'm from Dade County" {*3X screwed*}

With my ass out, skirt up I don't give a fuck
Bow down cause I run the South

Born in the city where they got no feelings, killers, M-I-A my niggaz
Home of the we don't play, better get out the way, you ain't enver seen a real go-rilla
Do not be thankin we soft or we sweet
Come on the opposite side of the beach
They gotta them yoppers to put you to sleep
Yeah that's them choppers you know what I mean
That's when the doctor stay boxin your dreams
When on the docks where they flippin that clean
Hot on the block it's a hundred degrees

We trillin cause "We the Best," Dade County tou better know it boy

[Chorus]

[C-Ride]

Hoppin out that Chevy on 28's, I'm dodgin power lines
We work hard, nigga you sleep, pu-pu-pushin we run the streets
You are what'chu eat, young pussy go brush your teeth
I'm tryin to keep Cash Money like Baby see

We Dade County goons, fuck them Dade County cops hoe
Get yo' set if you don't get wet in Dade County my hoe~!

[Dre]
Unhh, from the depths of C.C., back to Opa-Locka
D-R-E, North Miami shoot up up your block
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
I got a chopper in the kitchen, Betty Crock' is the name
I needs me my Dade County big booty hoe and she pretty
Let her push the Chevy all through the city
Let her know that 54's is good, Haiti, Opa-Town they got work
In Liberty City them niggaz smokin pounds of that purp', yup!
What it is, what it does, we the be-be-be-best
I'm from the city where you need to wear a vest underneath your v-v-v-vest
Name another city realer then the city I stay in
You can't cause there can't be another realer city than Dade, nigga!

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
