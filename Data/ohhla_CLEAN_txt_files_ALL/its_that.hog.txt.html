It's that PJ, coming out that 4-4
It's that PJ, coming out that 4-4
It's that PJ, coming out that 4-4
I'm bout to break em off, watch me crawl real slow

[PJ]
PJ I'm bout my pay, stay out my way cause I do not play
Coming down candy blue over grey, Houston Texas that's where I stay
I parlay sip pints of drank, like Lil' Scrappy money in the bank
These hoes bop when they see my paint, boys think I'm slipping hell no I ain't
Haters hate cause I'm stacking this green, Slim the Boss put me on team
Boss Hogg we wreck the scene, big white cup full of coedine
Making this money banging Screw, serve and collect that's what I do
Hate me I'll hate you, bust at me I'ma bust you
I ride blue peanut butter seats, fifth wheel and grill now the slab complete
Don't talk down cause I'm on my shine, you don't work you don't eat
I'm in the streets I'm in the hood, I'm straight nigga you see me
BET and MTV, your bitch told she wanna be with P
I'm just a G gotta maintain, never at home stay on a plane
Hitting licks hitting big stangs, PJ doing big thangs
I wreck the mic I rip the strip, my candy drip everytime I flip
This purple drank that's what I sip, H-Town baby don't trip

[Hook - 2x]

[PJ]
Back again I came to win, like Lil' Ke I pimp the pen
Start the Henn thick and thin, pull out the Benz hop in the wind
I'm setting trends I'm setting goals, no probation no parole
No time for that too thoed, trying to keep my pockets swoll
Showing these boys I'm one of a kind, bring the cars I'ma lead the line
Memphis fuck them Alpines, hit the club and it's going down
My time to shine better watch me, Shaelynn made by Versacci
Peeping boys trying to baller block me, mad as hell cause they can't stop me
Bend the watch what a good look, nothing free I had to push
Don't cross that road before you look, don't judge my cover read my book
My hoe put money off in my hand, stash filled up with rubberbands
Like T.I.P. my hustle grand, like D4L bitch I'm the man
Like a sunny day that's how I shine, money tall like Jaycie on Good Times
Like Lil' Wayne money on my mind, like 50 Cent I'ma die trying
Blowing on the mic like C4, kush got me high like a G4
These haters don't wanna see me blow, got me so sick like Ne-Yo

[Hook - 2x]

[PJ]
What it do mayn what's the deal, sip some drank pop a seal
Get your money keep it real, roll the dro smoke and chill
Like Pimp C work wood wheel, like Bun B I keep's it trill
Mouthpiece is gold kill, when I throw the diamonds off in my grill
Sitting on buck with the trunk cracked, trying to find out where the sluts at
And when I pull up on the scene, all the hoes say he done that
Can't fall off I'm too hot, sipping banging 2Pac
I'm out here getting this money dog, ain't worried bout what you got
I'm a grown man they lil' boys, you hate me that's obsolete
Ain't trying to get off in the game, I'm trying to make it out the streets
PJ that's the name, haters hate cause I'm having thangs
Need to get up off your ass, get out there and get your change
