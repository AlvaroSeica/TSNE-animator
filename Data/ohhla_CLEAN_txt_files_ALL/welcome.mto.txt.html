Ladies &amp; Gentlmen, Welcome to Violence
By word and the act, while violence cloaks itself in a plethora of disguises
it's favourite mantel still remains sex
Violence devours all it touchs, it's feracious appetite rarely fulfilled
Yet violence doesn't only destroy, it creates and moulds as well
Let's examine closely then this dangerously evil creation, this new breed
But a word of caution, ???, don't drop your guard
this repacious new breed prowls both alone and in packs
operating at any level, any time, any where and with any body..
Who are they?</pre>
