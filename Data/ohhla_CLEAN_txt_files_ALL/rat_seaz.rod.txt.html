[Intro: Li-Mouse (Cno Evil) {"Toilet Mouth"}]

Yeah, who the fuck is that, son?
{Yo.. why you talking to Mouse, for}
Is that talking about me, right up over there?
(Oh, the guy with the Wile E. Coyote hat on?)
{Why you mess around with Mouse?}
Yeah, man, what the fuck
This muthafucka must be wilding, son
{Oh shit I think that's Mouse in the corner right now looking me}
(Yeah, I think I know him, I think I know him)
{Oh man, yo, we out, we out}
Cats going around here talking about I'm with this chick
I'm with that chick, yo, why you doing that, why that?
So, what the fuck is that, man?
(It's alright, yo, yo, we got 'em, we got 'em)
Yo, I'mma tell you, I'mma tell you (uhh)
Tell you something, man (tell 'em)
Fucking idiots around here (fucking idiots)
Always talking shit, talking shit, listen
(Fucking toilet mouths) yo, yo, yo, yo

[kung fu sample w/ Intro]
	*sounds of fighting*
Ahh, ahh, help! Hey stop it!
	Get out of here!
Uhh, ohhh, ahh, ahh, ahh
	*sounds of fighting*
Huh? you dare to interfer with me, would ya?
	Not really, I don't want to, it's not my affair

[Li-Mouse]
First of all, why the fuck you looking at me, faggot?
I know I'm flying, and whatever, you're still a maggot
Grilling me, like you bout to do, something crazy
But it don't matter to me, cuz, the shit don't phase me
You fucking snitch, I guess you had to scratch that itch
Should of left your ass dug up, somewhere in a ditch
But nah, that ain't like me, son, I just let things go
Like the Nile River, son, I'mma let shit flow
Keep grilling me, like I won't smack your tricks out
None of ya'll are capable, ever to fix Mouse
You can never ever change the, spots on a leopard
Ya'll are just sheep, brainwashed, following the shephard
Attacking me, is useless, and you'll find that out soon
It's sort of like trynna nail Jell-O to a balloon
Yeah, my microphone style is too much to manage
FEMA is still trynna tally up the amount of damage
To infrastructures, bridges, buildings and such
I crack granite, immediately, when I touch
This device, that's been abused by all ya'll dummies
I walk around not carrying, whether or not you love me
So next time, I better know you, before you fucking hug me
It's like I'm Muslim, cats always try to bug me, you feel me?

[Interlude: kung fu sample (Cno Evil)]
You got in my way! (Yeah, trying to bug you)
	Huh? (You gotta bug.. yo, check yo)
*sounds of fighting* (Yah-yo)

[Cno Evil]
Music got a low battery and we came here to charge it
Rappers is driving me crazy, and I think I'm getting car sick
Throwing up, while gang signs is being thrown up
Wack rappers blowing up, when are the real showing up?
Aiyo, Crayola color rap, got ya'll up in a sleeperhold
I'm getting old, best to change it up, with the deeper mold
See us roll, read the scrolls, best to believe what's told
Know your role, before you take a step, look down and check your toes
Watch your feet, your shoestrings is in a tight knot
Got no reason to ask us questions, if we might pop
Thanks alot for inspiration, lead us not into temptation
Change hip hop collaboration, like Barack we rule the nation
Bitch, feel the 'kitchen nightmare' on the Elm Street
With the knife chop, and I don't think that is healthy
Think green with my vision, many years on this mission
Prestige rap division, clean your ears and take a listen
Whistling, while we work, you're feeling like a jerk
Yes, your wrist is glistening but what is it really worth?
It's Rat Seazon, and snitches is being hunted down
Bobo the Clown chasing headless chickens through the town
Big red noses, can't oppose us
Exterminator salvation, muthafucka, can't control us

[kung fu sample]
So that's it, Shaolin Clan, damn you!
	*sounds of fighting*
	Heh, not very good, it's a child's trick
How do you know?
	You fool! You're so dumb, it's obvious
Enough! Let's get to the point!</pre>
