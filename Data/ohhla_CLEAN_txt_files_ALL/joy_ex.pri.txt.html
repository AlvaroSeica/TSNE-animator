Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Get on the bus, the joy explosion
Get on the bus, the joy explosion
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

We are stardust, we are golden
Get on the bus, the joy explosion
We are stardust, we are golden
Get on the bus, the joy explosion

We got it, you know it and we don't stop
We gonna shout til we get just what we want
I said you got it, you know it and we don't quit
We gonna get real hot on this love trip

La la la la la, la la la lala (sion sion sion...)
La la la la la, la la la lala (sion sion sion explosion)

When you set up and you get up and you jump
Put your head, knick the bed and pull your comb
Now you better get the setup, if you don't
You don't wanna pull a gun up in the club
You gonna get it when I'm comin up
You can bet I show the minute when I'm showin up
It's hot, if you got your hands throw them up
Got love, get it up while we got the love

Work that, get that, keep it hot
Bang that, both they got a lot
Point that, work that, keep it wild
Bang that, fuck that, just don't stop
Work that, get that, keep it hot
Bang that, both they got a lot
Point that, work that, keep it wild

When you on the bus, kid just don't stop

We are stardust, we are golden
Get on the bus, the joy explosion
We are stardust, we are golden
Get on the bus, the joy explosion

La la la la la, la la la lala (sion sion sion...)
La la la la la, la la la lala (sion sion sion explosion)

Move your body like delicate kisses
Swift my boys coming out your speakers
X-bump beepers, cut leashes in pieces
I'm from a different species
Cosmic bitch, accomplished trick
Never gave a Starbuck shit
Never get high, maybe on top of it
Walkin it, get on my drug rocket shit
Explosion, here it comes, steppin out the mace
I've never done to me, come together everyone
From another planet, what's happenin?
Keep clappin, I'm the boss cutting

Smacking, smacking, if you don't come along
Sing sing a song, sing sing sing along
A long time sunshine since I've been gone
But I'm back to bring you back to where you once belonged
Back to bring you back to where you once belonged
Back to bring you back to where you once belonged

We are stardust, we are golden
Get on the bus, the joy explosion
We are stardust, we are golden
Get on the bus, the joy explosion

We got it, you know it and we don't stop
We gonna shout til we get just what we want
I said you got it, you know it and we don't quit
We gonna get real hot on this love trip

La la la la la, la la la lala (sion sion sion...)
La la la la la, la la la lala (sion sion sion explosion)

Hands up, she said up above
Hands up, she said up above
Hands up, you can do with yours
Hands up, coming up with love love love love

Hands up, she said up above
Hands up, she said up above
Hands up, you can do with yours
Hands up, coming up with love love love love

La la la la la, la la la lala (sion sion sion...)
La la la la la, la la la lala (sion sion sion explosion)</pre>
