[Chorus: T.I. singing]
Smokin weed, ridin chrome
Only thing I've ever known
is walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives
Slangin ki's, sprayin K's
Every day we gettin paid
to walk on the wildside
Welcome to our lives

[T.I.]
Come take a lil' walk with me through my neighborhood and come spend a day in my trap
Get yo' paper right and that yay some good but just keep a tool in yo' lap
My lil' partner holdin that work, nigga want weight but keep around back
Best not violate on my turf, nigga you's in danger, die like that
Ain't no investigation, no statements and no witnesses, we ain't seen shit
Pull up after dark with that jewelry on to come see a bitch, that's what he get
We on dark roads with no street lights, that pistol play after fistfights
And them geek monsters walk all night with they crack pipes tryin to get right
Midnight and we shoot dice, the whole house smellin like cooked crack
You beat me and you talk shit, you get shot bitch and I took that
Hoodrats on deck, that loud is all I blow
This shit to you might sound wild, but this life is all I know

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Ay, can you picture me back in '93 bumpin Dr. Dre while I hit some weed?
Cut school, make ten G, 13 tryin to get ki's
At 15 I was full-grown, get wrong, get bust on
My uncle gave me a bunch of work and that shit was gone by the next morning
Young wild nigga runnin with me, homicide wasn't nothin to us
Dead body wasn't nothin to see, that pistol play was just fun to us
I was 19 with two felonies, one of my best friends had a life sentence
How my Uncle Fred was just like me and had a bunch of partners no longer livin
All about that cocaine dealin, no education, no pot to piss in
Old school on chrome wheels, window tinted, pistol hidden
That shit that I come from, in my heart fear ain't none
Stand tall, I can't run from that wildside that I walk on

[Chorus]

[A$AP Rocky]
Uhh, yeah
All I ever did was put on, all my old friends tryin to get on
Shorty fell out makin diss songs, never talk down when I get home
Ain't the type of nigga you can shit on, hundred spokes, brick, chrome
God-body, big bone, that's hard-body, Jim Jones
Niggaz know the sound how we switch on 'em, finna wild out on a Tip song
Better make a toast, nigga Tip home, first get the bread then you get gone
From the land of the lead where they spit chrome where most kids never get to live long
Yet they pissed off, get pissed on, pistol-whipped and stripped homie
Left for a minute and they switched on me, caught 'em talkin down turnin bitch on me
And they snitch on me, ain't got shit on me, so my guess is death is what they wish on me
So I'm blowin on them candles, closed lids and dark eyes
Cause hate's never part-time when you on that wildside

[Chorus]</pre>
