Song:   Elizabeth
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uncle Sam is a naughty old man he says he wants you but he only wants to use you
He has a woman named Elizabeth she walk the streets selling her body for glory
Immorality
They get drunk from the blood of saints not the kind that are made into statues
Her brother john drinks wine all day he and his friends
Trying to take our souls away
Oh it's sad to say but uncle sam is going to have his day
And they will weep for Elizabeth

Uncle Sam is a naughty old man he says he wants you but he only wants to use you
He has a woman named Elizabeth she walk the streets selling her body for glory
Immorality
They get drunk from the blood of saints not the kind that are made into statues
Her brother john drinks wine all day he and his friends his friends
They can't take our souls away
Oh it's sad to say but my uncle sam is going to have his day
And they will weep for Elizabeth</pre>
