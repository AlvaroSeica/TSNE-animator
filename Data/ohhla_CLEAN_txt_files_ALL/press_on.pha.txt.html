Song:   Press On
Typed by: Byg_Balla@hotmail.com

Lord put a song in my heart to
Be the rhythm that I march to toward You
Keep me warm like a Sherlin with grace
As I walk with the wind of the world in my face this
Place is not home and I can sense it
As I roam the earth I've learned how to pitch my tent quick
And break it down taking it down a notch
May I be found to be faithful safely counted in Your flock
Earth is not a safe place to wander
Many of the faith based lay waylaid and conquered
Mainly cause they traded Your honor
For created things being fond of these things kind of
Trying to have two gods ruling
But You're not fooled and You're not cool
With sudo gods dueling, and trying to bump You for Your space
They get in front of You and have us front on You to Your face
I pray for all the soldiers who've fallen
From so strong in their walk to no longer even crawling
And I'm not looking down from so high
Cause I know that there but buy the grace of God would go I
And probably have I'd probably crash
If it wasn't for Your grace covering all my mistakes and other flaws
Lord teach me to learn to love Your law
Like the writer of the Psalm 119 and other songs

[Chorus]
We must press on, press on
Yes, we must press on
Press on</pre>
