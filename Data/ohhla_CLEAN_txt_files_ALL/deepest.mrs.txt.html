[Murs]
I don't know about you
But first thing I wake up, every morning
Look in the mirror and say to myself is
"I am going to die!"

And I've come to terms with that
But then when where and how where's my concern is at
It's fucked up that I'll be dead once I've learned all of that
Fact is we musn't fear it, for fear is the mindkiller
Realize you're born to die and there ain't nothin iller
There's life and there's death, all else is just filler
So that situation you mill in that got you hella stressed
Trust it won't mean shit, once you take your last breath
Kick the bucket, buy the farm, eternal version of forgettin
to set the alarm, the deepest sleep of sleeps
I'm talkin six feet deep, that final appointment
That we all have to keep, you know that meeting that cancels
all the rest of your plans, in an overpriced box
A coffin, rotten rockin that eternal b-boy stance
Your family and friends come to tears at first glance
Regret that they never said, what they had to say
when they all had the chance
Hands down the worst shit that could possibly happen
There ain't nothin like death to straight fuck up your day
But there ain't nothin like livin to make that feeling go away
So go ahead and play
But when the head coach, calls the time out, you're permanently benched
It's too late, to sulk about, how your time was spent
Breakups or bad credit, it's all temporary
Just be sure to make some memories for all your friends to carry
So when your soul slips through, you rest as you sleep on a stretcher
You can rest in peace and know the, world won't forget ya
And I'll catch you on the other side, we riders of the sea
Who know the world must go on, without you and me</pre>
