[Intro: King Just]
*Clears through* Well, well, what is it? Speak up!
(News from the East, sire, King Just has returned!)
Stop lying! Stop, stop, stop, stop lying (oh no, is it real?)
Stop lying! Stop, stop, stop lying (oh no, oh, oh, oh no)
Stop lying! Stop, stop, stop, stop lying (oh no, is it real?)
Stop lying! Stop, stop, stop lying (oh no, oh, oh, oh no)

[King Just]
I know hip hop's been a draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag
Well Chokemon's back with a brand new bag
Father time, ya'll can rock me like a clock
Auto ghetto glock, or watch - me - pop
Stop, cop and roll, that's a weed drill
Killa Hill, we the reason why most of ya'll real
Stand still, at attention, you talking to a general
Criminal minded, light years ahead of you
Better you than me, rather she than he
He can try to be all you can be, in your little army
Think war stories, won't gain you no glory
Like my dad on christmas, you got nothing for me
You bore me, matter of fact, you boring
I stand tall, you don't want it with the great balls of Yao Ming
Housing wanna lock us down, but they clowns
We the surface dwellers that'll bring you back to the underground

[Chorus: Starr]
KJ you have done it again
You are, electrifying
KJ you have done it again
The earth, to keep defying
KJ you have done it again
The war's intensifying
KJ you have done it again
How dare you keep on surviving

[King Just]
I'm the eternal flames
I'm the reason why most of ya'll changed ya'll name
I'm the guiding light
I'm the reason why most of ya'll see at night
Zero vision with percision, I make deaf people listen
I got 'nuff ammunition, that'll heat up your kitchen
Stop bitching, channels switching, dirt kicking, cock licking
Wear your cotton picking, I'mma make, sure you good riddance
You're forbidden, no bullshitting, you'll jeopardize the mission
Where's your henchmen? I hang 'em out to dry, I'll trench 'em
The tension is building up, stand up
And what you believe in? King Just
I wear KJ's, MJ's, they cost too much
I'm on eBay, selling all my bootleg stuff
The road rough, gotta be tough, in this real world
I bring jewels, and I ain't talking diamonds and pearls

[Chorus]

[King Just]
I've done it again, and I'm still doing it
Physically fit, to put the muscle to it
Calastetic, alphabetics, I'm the first one to set it
I'm that name brand shit, while ya'll dudes is generic
Fucking Bo Derrick, reading L Rons, dianetics
I done sold out my records, but I got, no credit
Got a leopard skin rug, with a double lizard tongue
Do your thing, but you can't bring the level that I brung
You can sing what I sung, sea bang on the drums
With a click, running thick, from the burb to the slums
We smoke blue bubble gum, we got 2 for 5 jums
We the shit so much, I think our ass got the runs
We got big heavy guns, we got Grand Canyon lungs
Mr. Miyagi, better play attention Daniel-son
Tell every MC to come, if he or she want some
And I guarantee you, like Jet Li, I be "The One", one

[Chorus]

[Outro: King Just]
