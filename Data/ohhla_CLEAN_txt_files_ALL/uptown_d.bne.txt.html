[Intro: Bizzy]
Egypt we all around, Egypt we all around, yeahhhh
(Jesus is comin 'fore they take my breath away)
Uptown downtown, Egypt we all around, Egypt we all around, yeahhhh
(Jesus is comin 'fore they take my breath away)
Comin out uptown downtown, Egypt we all around, Egypt we all around, yeahhhh
(Jesus is comin 'fore they take my breath away)
We comin out uptown downtown, Egypt we all around, Egypt we all around
(Hahahaha)

[Bizzy Bone]
Up in the storm, out of a mirage, deep in the ghetto, the Lord is in charge
Swords comin out of my mouth, ready can't block the barrage
I'm still dancin on the side of the {?} the road
On the rise like dough, it's fully approach the set for sho'
I don't wan't no problems problems, comin at me fast as a bullet
Even a missile right to the gristle, pain sizzle in my mullet
God do with it told, keepin the fightin steady at minimum, for sho'
I better listen to the granddad, cause baby only God knows
Do what it do, look at the {?} as others and do to you
Do what it do, look at the guy with the speech impediment, keepin it true
Comin with proof, automatic heat with the static gotta have it in the battle too
Trippin in my boots, movin in the roof, what I gotta do? 
Pretty much what I told you, hey
One for the money, one for my dunny
I'ma move it like officer gunnin on the block with Christ
Fake crack on these dummies
With the four winds tellin me to do my thang, honey

[Chorus 4X: Bizzy Bone]
We comin out uptown downtown, Egypt we all around
Egypt we all around, yeahhhh (Jesus is comin 'fore they take my breath away)

[Bizzy Bone]
Keepin it rockin, hoppin out of the truck, and get'cha bucks
And we stuck in this city, idiots signed with a touch
And a crime with a rush, come up, don't show your nuts
On a line full of souls and spirits can't be too much
And to die for the kings you teach to be just
On the minds, gotta preach, divine and the rugged rough
So we calm in the mountain, wanted the youth; no lust
Let me shine, announce the pronunciation for your love
Hoppin the fences, cuttin my legs, goin dutch, what?
I'ma get a drink before I leave out in these cuffs, cuffs
I sit in the county, ready to bail me out, what, what?
But still ain't, paid the bounty, me and my lawyer gettin crushed
It's lucky when they stopped me in Vegas and then they come up
But I'm trusty, loyal and faithful like angels in the dust
Tellin 'em love me and leave me, BB be headin towards the shhh
Me and my body on the the side, we ride, the tribe is up

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Headed for destinations, people's hallucinations in the nation
Gravity and dimensions, comin aboard the battle station
Facin many adversities, horses, Kentucky Derbys
Hearses and dead bodies, and worse when it comes early
Man I'm dirty, made pretty through weakness, I'm tellin you briefly
Hey, I don't want no beef, I pray; Allah, please keep me
To the people, feed me, secretly in the G way
Leeway, rollin on the freeway, leave me
Please babe, take me to heaven breathin with Jesus
He quick, with telekinesis, don't believe me? Go breezy
Deem it, hey hey, I don't know what to say
Huh, let's honor the lord, and that's the only way
Gotta go, flow, ready and gotta go to work for sure
Yo, hustle to be a pro, stack paper and get your flow
Whatever it takes for paper I saw, you better go keep it strong
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, praise God

[Chorus]</pre>
