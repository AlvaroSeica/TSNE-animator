Pre-Chorus: Skillz
You remind me of a model on a runway
You remind me of that girl in my dreams (In my dreams...)
Please don't mind if I tell ya that I want you
Just imagine all the thangs we'd do

Chorus: Play-N-Skillz
In the bedroom (In the bedroom)
In the club (In the club)
In the car, I don't care
All the thangs we'd do
On the island (On the island)
On vacation (On vacation)
On a plane, I don't care
All the thangs we'd do

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Tell me where you never been, or where you wanna go
So I can get it together, ya know
Jet skis, green trees
I even got money and honey for bees
I knew that, so we can just do that
Take a little dip, where the fool at, who at, got that
Pop that, knock that, in the bedroom
But we said, "Stop that"
I'm fly, D-O-Double G-Y
Private plane in the sky
Twenty thousand feet high
With a club inside
We can do it everywhere, I can take you anywhere

Hook 1: Play-N-Skillz
London, Miami
Me and you can go there
Chicago, Toronto
Me and you can go there
Atlanta, New York City
Me and you can go there
Las Vegas, big paper
All the thangs we'd do

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Play]
You remind me of a runway model
Runaway Lamboorgini, full throttle
It's fine, yeah, one of a kind
Call you a spade, shape like a bottle
Gone off the grey goose, pay me no mind
If I say it, then I mean it, I ain't spittin' no lies
Make it clear like the South Beach water
Got a few millie's like my name was Ray Connor

Hook 2: Play-N-Skillz
Bahamas, Jamaica
Me and you can go there
California, to Houston
Me and you can go there
Paris back to Dallas
Me and you can go there
Puerto Rico, big paper
All the thangs we'd do

Repeat Pre-Chorus

[Verse 3: Skillz]
I used to dream 'bout a girl like you
Like styles like that, can't believe it's true
I used to the girls that's full of drama
You the type of girl you bring home to mama
Forget about the stress, no troubles today
We could see the whole world in a couple of days
Out this world, we can get there soon
Nowadays, you can catch that flight to the moon

Repeat Pre-Chorus
