[Intro: Itchy-Fingas]
Yo, yeah, love New York
Love New York, yo, yo

[Itchy-Fingas]
I sit pretty in the city of lights, cameras and action
Highway car chases, rappers beatin' body cases
I ask no questions, so don't give me no answers
N.Y.C., home of the Yankees and Giants
Rappers alliance, capitol of drugs and violence
Biggest projects in the world, it's Queensbridge and the Hook
Federal crooks that took, crazy money this year
White collar the crime, and I ain't get a company dime
I hustle and grind, until I get what's rightfully mine

[Chorus: Triggnomm]
E-Y-E, L-O-V-E, N-Y, I flip a pie from Bed-stuy to C.I.
E-Y-E, L-O-V-E, N-Y, on the B.Q.E., from B.K. to Q.B.
E-Y-E, L-O-V-E, N-Y...

[Triggnomm]
It's money and muscle, my M1's and my duns
All strapped for gunplay, I pops in Kay Slay
To we New York from the talk down to the walk
Down to layin' down, white gowns and chalk
What ya'll thought? Coney Island niggas don't get out?
Pearl Handle flip out, spit a half a clip out
Where ya'll been? Ya'll never seen, thugs this clean
Spit sixteen's, still flippin' morphine
And who says we can't live a life of Spalding
Cop a Wallgreen, and make all green clean

[Chorus: Triggnomm]
E-Y-E, L-O-V-E, N-Y, I flip a pie from Bed-stuy to C.I.
E-Y-E, L-O-V-E, N-Y, on the B.Q.E., from B.K. to Q.B.
E-Y-E, L-O-V-E, N-Y, reppin' the B.X., while puffin' 'dro in Y-O
E-Y-E, L-O-V-E, N-Y, be with Red and La, on the low in L.I.
E-Y-E, L-O-V-E, N-Y, and money makin' Manhattan, straight gun clappin'
E-Y-E, L-O-V-E, N-Y, with the Clan, wildin', representin' Shaolin
E-Y-E, L-O-V-E, N-Y, we take it there, we take it anywhere, go there
E-Y-E, L-O-V-E, N-Y, we take it there, we take it anywhere, go there

[Bam Bam]
Word is bond, yo, what's up with ya'll dudes?
I treat ya'll like roaches and clap ya'll fools
One by one, I'll impress ya'll dudes
Big water bug thugs, I eat ya'll food
What, who want it with the bad men? The act up man
Got big things to back up, man
Ya'll never listen 'til I have to clap up man
Strap up man, load 'em up and pack up man
Now you want war? You don't want nothin'
Cause on the streets, my peeps keep the heat
And leave all beef well done
You act brolic, but you frail, son
You better bail, son, mess around, make this hammer leave you nail, son
I be the Bam Bam, Bronx style bad man
Bald head black man, ready for the action
Meet if you want, I pump holes in ya'll
I love N.Y. 'til the day it's over, ya'll

[Chorus]</pre>
