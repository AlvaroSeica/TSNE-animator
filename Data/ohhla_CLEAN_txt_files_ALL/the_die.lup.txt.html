[Lupe Fiasco - Intro]
I present... the death... of The Cool!
 
(DIE!!) Well I heard like a group of cows, that all ya enemies wanna shot you down
They got AK-47s and a bunch of Mac 11s
semi-automatic weapons that produce "Kapows!"
Word on the street is, they all got heaters
They gon' hit you up and you ain't even gon' see it
You got a lotta money, I ain't tryna be funny
but they say, "Where you goin, you ain't even gon' need it"
They see you ridin 'round, shinin with ya fine round diamonds 
pretty green-eyed lady
Been on the sideline plottin, while you primetime poppin
Hungry niggaz want a piece of your pastry
I suggest you protect yo' bakery, cause they comin for yo' head
And it's a bounty on that chain that's hangin from yo' neck, they said..
 
[Chorus]
I don't know, what you've been told
in your ear, but I hear it's goin down
Somebody gotta - (DIE!!)
Don't know, what you been told in your ear
But, business goin round, somebody gotta (DIE!!)
 
[Gemstones]
Hit a nigga wit the mini-mac strap
Clap any nigga think he gettin Gs' down here 
Enemy to any nigga gettin money on my honey
Man, I heard Micheal Young is the weed clown here
Run up on a nigga from the back wit a Mac
Gon' be strapped cause a nigga finna squeeze off ten
Run up on this nigga 'Lac, RAT-TA-TAT-TAT
Click CLACK, where this nigga at? I needs in
Shit is goin down ever I see him
Bump a nigga out like Oxy-10
And keep a couple of dollars up in the wallet 
to pay the cops so they can never box me in
(DIE!!) - that's what I'm thinkin 
while ridin around polishin this big pis-tol
I'ma catch him in the wind, pray the gun don't jam
So until we meet again, nigga it's cool!

[Chorus]
[Lupe overlapping chorus]
Maaan, man...you can't believe none of that, man 
You need to, you just need to relax man, trust me
 
[Lupe Fiasco]
Don't pay them niggaz no mind
They hatin on you, ain't nobody witta shotty
and plannin on doin a robbery, itchin to catch a body
Creepin in a stolen jalopy, out there waitin on you

[Gemstones]
I'm sittin in a stolen car, finna rob this nigga
Should I let the mini-Mac or the shotgun hit him?
I been waitin all day, tryna SPOT this nigga
I cain't let him get away, I'ma pop this nigga - UHH!!!

[Lupe Fiasco]
Plus they don't know about the chopper in the trunk
The Glocks in a box and the nine on tuck
The bulletproof glass, the 40's in the stash
You pull the steerin wheel and it pop on up
 
[Gemstones]
Forty caliber stashed up in the stash box
Bulletproof windows, you couldn't break em wit a padlock
Ak in the trunk, where the sounds bump
Two twin Glock 40's, and a nine in his damn crotch
 
[Lupe Fiasco]
Maaaaaaan, we finna go up in this club, show a lil' love
Get a few drinks, holla at some gurls
Snatch up a pair, leave outta there
Put some 'dro in the air, then go and get some grub
 
[Gemstones]
We finna go up in this club, show a lil' love
Get a few drinks, holla at some gurls
Snatch up a pair, leave outta there
Put some 'dro in the air, then catch a few slugs

[Lupe Fiasco] 
Ay...ay, ay, pull over right here, I gotta take a pee
and don't go nowhere, nigga wait for me
and if some niggaz do kill you in the next few minutes
Just remember my nigga, it's a heaven for a G

{*music abruptly stops as night air and city ambience is heard*}

[Lupe Fiasco - talking] 
Ay ay, hold this right there I'll be
I'll be right back, I gotta take a piss man hold on
Fo' sho, ay man, ay don't leave I'll be right back
Ay, don't leave I'll be back
[car door slams, radio plays Lupe Fiasco's "The Cool"]
