Typed by: AZ Lyrics

See when I do joints like this?
I do it for the young'un in the ghetto
That you aint gon never hear his story cause he ain't gonna make it to tell it
So you know what's crazy
I went to court the other day, the D.A. say she hate me
How you gonna hate me when me and Lou just took 20 racks and put coats on them kids backs?
It's 30 degrees outside
24, how could I ask for more?
I got my deals, gettin' real, I'm makin' cash fo' sure
Stuntin' every chance I get because I had it poor
But every time I go to sleep I hear the devil at my door
And I'm on them paper so them courts are goin' back and forth
Dealin with probation, man they all said I'd be back for sure
Minds is turned to zombies from that raw because it's crack the law
You wonder why them babies runnin' crazy 'stead of clappin' off
Gettin' life before they get pussy
Cause ain't nobody love 'em so they lives get took in
Locked in cages, having fighting over cookies
And much strange, is happy them days ain't never killed 'em
Yea I remember, it was a hot December
Niggaz die on top of winter cause them kids need them toys
Well Santa Claus don't see them boys
Them see the girls around here, there's Jack boys down stairs
No man with the big bag just man with the big gat
Try and take your shit back cause he feel the world owe him
And his daughter want a Barbie bike for Christmas, he gon show up
That the love is there, no mother there
Just her and little brother there
We wash our pain with Belvedere and use the drugs they brought us here
We get high to get by
Hotdogs no ribeyes with tears drip from red eyes
Is what ends don't meet the damn lies
The D.A. said she hate me but I don't understand
When I just rocked the show in front of 50.000 fans
I think that bitch racist, she probly in a clash
She take her pain out on me but she probly need a man
I took my mom from public housin', put it in the Styx
We came a long way from welfare and gettin wic
That shit just made me hungry
And now we gettin' rich and all these niggaz gettin' sick
I know they wanna get me hit cause I'm Ballin
Yea, cause I'm Ballin
It's like sometimes I always gotta let these type of joints go man, just speakin' to the streets
And bitch said she hate me
I felt some time away about that
Last night we just came out giving 2-300 pair of shoes to the schools
To the girls' and the boys' basketball teams
How you hate me?
You hate me cause I'm doin' I'm supposed to do and I got that money and I'm makin more money than you?
Well, bitch you can hate me for that
Let's get it</pre>
