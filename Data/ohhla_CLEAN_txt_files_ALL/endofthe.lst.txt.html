Song:   End of the Beginning
Typed by: Lost Secret

[Chorus 2X: Nightwish "End of All Hope" sample]
It is the end of all hope
To lose the child, the faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me

[Storm Da Ghetto Mutant]
The divine artificer, spitting vials of truth
Burning the world lies, right before the eyes of the youth
To save their soul (Metatron: What you mean, Storm?), Eye of Heru
From the preachers, deceivers tryin' to steal their jewel
I be the coming of the law, the "Good Book" never saw
My tongue be Ra's blazing sword, revealing how Jesus is a Czar
Heru's the first to have his birth, announced by the Eastern Star
But the astronomonical reality of the Bible is barred
They keep the masses lost in ignorance, spiritual abyss
Placin' thier faith in a savior, that don't exist
Shepherds of perversion, sewing seeds of blashphemy
Shall be devoured by the Worm of Seth for all eternity
As I blast ya mind's eye, illumination of a comet
Openin' the Lost Secrets, killin' all you false prophets
With my Urais arisen from it's bodily prison
Bringing to light these visions, and the end of world religions

[Chorus 2X]

[Archangel Metatron]
I must remain cautious, enemy forces attack with Trojan Horses
Metatron's armed with this pencil
My heart pumps the blood, shed over Solomon's Temple
Knowledge is meant to, be revealed in stages, I hold the shield of David
Standing between the pillars of Heaven and Earth
Y'all are blind to the light, we inherit since birth
I'm reppin' the 'Hurst, cuz I cater to your profane mind
Then I write lyrical flames fueled by propane rhymes
Fuck turning shit to gold...
I perform the alchemy that helps ascend your lost souls
All I need, is this mic to change ya
My tongue be the spear, that murdered your Savior
Bathe ya, with the blood of every forgotten spirit
Every whore, thief, and murderer that begs for forgiveness
And invite them to your Sunday service
If this rhyme offends you, then good, I did it on purpose

[Chorus 2X]

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
To be someone like me, both king and a priest
Mishphat tsedek here to wreck ya set and it's a
Wrap, the end of all time
No more hope in ya heart, no more crime in the streets
No more crack to sell, no more ice, no more shiest, no more nice
No more life, no more death, no more Christ.... mandileon without no face
Rosacrucians rejoice, Nation of Islam waits for the ship
Copeless like a Christian in the rapture
Snap ya self out of the dreamstate, I rep the Liberty State
And celebrate, that you alive now
To the new generation, life is weird
The end of all hope, is the beginning
Of something better, tsunami plus volcano; double header!</pre>
