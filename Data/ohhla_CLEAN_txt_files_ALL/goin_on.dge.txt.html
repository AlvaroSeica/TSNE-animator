	And he definitely got it goin on
	So get on the dancefloor and, and let's do it with him

[Chorus: missjones]
Don't stop, can't stop
Doug E. you got it goin on.. (say what?)
Don't stop (c'mon) can't stop (uhh)
Doug E. you got it goin on..

[Doug E. Fresh]
Yo, there's a party goin on right here
And it's a celebration, to last throughout the years
So bring yo' good times, and yo' laughter too
We're gonna celebrate, and, party witchu, c'mon missjones

[Chorus: missjones]
Don't stop (c'mon) can't stop (mmm)

(let's all celebrate, and have a good time, c'mon missjones)
Don't stop (uhh) can't stop (uhh)
Doug E. you got it goin on..

[Doug E. Fresh]
Yo, yo, yo!
I like the way it's goin down
Shit is so hype that I can't sit down
Bodies bouncin, DJ announcin
So many women I can't stop countin
One by one I spread light like sun
as I press up, keep my wreck up, you can check up
from my feet below yo to my neck up
Smooth as water, and here's the daily order
I'd like to thank all the supporters
Uhh, and I know some of y'all caught us
in yo' city, but we was gettin pity
Most of y'all negroes some said who is he?
On stage in a rage next day front page
Headlines read - HE GOT WHAT YOU NEEEEEEEEED
Uhh, c'mon!

[Chorus: missjones]
Don't stop - ohh no - can't stop
Doug E. you got it goin on.. (say what?)
Don't stop, can't stop
Doug E. you got it goin on..

[Doug E. Fresh]
Yo, yo, yo!
No time to waste, let's congregate
"Six minutes I'm on" and I just can't wait
As I step through, make an attempt to
party zen then I represent who?
East coast, who?  West coast, who?
Old school, who?  New school
It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
And if yo' shit's - fat, then that's that!
{*beatboxing*}
Yo, yo, and as a matter of fact
Don't get it twisted, and if you missed it
Before I stop, but the fans insisted
for me to return cause I burn baby burn
And people yearn, out of concern, to confirm
I rip the stages, flip the pages
Style is ageless, c'mon, uhh!
I said - I rip the stages, flip the pages
The style is ageless, and I'm say it again y'all
I rip the stages, flip the pages
Style is ageless, ah c'mon missjones, uhh!

[Chorus: missjones]
Don't stop (say what?) can't stop (uhh)
Doug E. you got it goin on.. (uhh, say what now?)
Don't stop (c'mon) can't stop
Doug E. you got it goin on..

[Doug E. Fresh]
Ahhh-hah, yeah, huh..
Uhh, say what?
C'mon
Yeah, yeah
Uhh, say what now?
Uhh, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yo, yo, yo
Somebody say WIIIIND ME UP-AH! (WIIIIND ME UP-AH!)
Somebody say WIIIIND ME UP-AH! (WIIIIND ME UP-AH!)
Somebody say ahh ahh ahh ahh (ahh ahh ahh ahh)
Say ahh ahh ahh ahh (ahh ahh ahh ahh)
C'mon baby baby c'mon y'all
C'mon baby baby c'mon y'all
C'mon baby baby c'mon y'all
C'mon c'mon c'mon y'all
And it's alright, and it's all good
And it's alright, and it's all good
C'mon baby baby c'mon y'all

And it's alright, and it's all good
