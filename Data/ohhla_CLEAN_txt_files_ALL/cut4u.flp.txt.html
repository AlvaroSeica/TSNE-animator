[Lil' Flip talking]
Lil' Flip,this for the ladies though
yeah this for the ladies

[Chorus: Lil' Flip]
I Cut 4 you but girl I got things to do
I bet you wonderin' what I'm doin
when I ain't wit' you I got money
to make I got places to go so you
ain't gotta worry if I'm out chasin hoes

[Verse One: Lil' Flip]
I tell you wear a nigga's boxers and ya hottie top
would you like me if i didnt have a Jag
off the lot and when I hit the mall and shop
I'm buyin all the socks and if I got into some
trouble would you call the cops? I needa ride-or-die chick
like the LOS that know how to drive a stick
in a yellow vette' I needa gal that know how ta pull
silly stunts I needa gal that know how to roll philly blunts
and if I wanna drank she gon' hold my ace
and if I ever get locked up she gon' promote my tapes
she under stand when a nigga say I gotta show
and when I gotta show that means that I gotta go
I'm tellin you all this right know cuz' I gotta know
are you down wit' me becuz I gotta lotta dough
and all of my jewlery gotta lotta snow
[girl:what you need Flip]
[Flip:girl notta hoe]

[Chorus repeat 2X]

[Verse Two: Lil' Flip]
I only like fine woman like Destiny's child and if
I say I'm Lil' Flip I bet she'll smile I dont
belivin buyin dranks but I can show U, a mic
you dont believe my teeth cost then I can show ya
a price I paid 20 on my piece I paid 50 on my teeth and
U dont wanna know how much I paid for my bentley
but it dont matter girl I got mo' money than Bill Gates
and I'ma stay paid as long as my record's
still playin but niggas still hatin cuz they gotta broad
wit no Job, or they gotta chicken head wit no Job and no car
[Lil' Flip talking on the phone]
girl be quiet
[boy]
Lil' Flip we gotta show
you can go out wit' ya friends I'ma do my own thing

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse Three: Lil' Flip]
and I dont give my dough and I got lick e'm low and
if yo' friends dont like me fa'get dem hoes
I got you drivin navigators and drivin sports cars
I got you steppin out the house in guzzi sports bra's
I got you doin alotta stuff that you never use to do
I got you wearin baggets the size of a rubies Q
I got you takin vacation while I'm playin playstation
[girl talking]
he went off wit' anotha girl

[Flip]
baby they jus hatin keep waitin pretty soon
we gon' spend some time and if I wanna stay paid
I have to spitt' rhymes so if you done wit me baby then
it aint no problem and we can ride side by side
like bat man and robin

[Chorus till end]</pre>
