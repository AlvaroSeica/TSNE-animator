Yeah, yeah

[Skyzoo]
Uh, anticipation through the roof
Bigger basements with bigger tables for scrappin up the brew
Get it shakin, if they've been waitin, to pay for this is two's
Clock workin for the purchase and labeled it much new

[Torae]
Thought you peruse through the rumor mill section of your favorite site
Some say it's destined, some say it's questioned, some say it's hype
I say the blessing that you possess when you paid the price
Two of the best, ever connected on a single mic

[Skyzoo]
Mike Jeffrey with the robe on, gave 'em quotables so ons
If I get this commercial with Spike, call me a so long
Predicted to be on mile high with the seat drawn
Pen game see ons, Big told me to go long

[Torae]
Uh, it's so wrong, mind blowin how we on this joint
Came into entry-level position, now we own this joint
The Barrel Brothers from the Brook', no Jonas joint
Niggaz can't see us like the credits on the bonus joint

[Skyzoo]
Bonus on the throw in, definition of go in
Paper Mate veins, my father already wrote this
Breakaway aim, you weave, I still won't miss
Shoot through your Theory, if you never been to the Low Ends

[Torae]
And that's no diss to Tribe, 'cause notice describe
The focus provide, when those pens collide
Our whole list for pride, the whole shit contrived
The dopeness combined when Tor' get with Sky'

[Skyzoo]
When Sky' get with Tor', you curtain call everything
Rumors turned out to turned out and to the present Kings
Movin words out, word-of-mouth can turn to gettin rings
Drums sound like dumbs, the kick is where the Dessie ring

[Torae]
And this is where your Heaven meets Hell and your effort meet fail
I don't F with these stales
Shit is stuck at retail, ass rappers
When the simple fact is that this corner boy crafted another corner store classic

[Skyzoo]
The daily conversation is breakin down into fractions
This rap shit is water, I cornered this from the tuck
When I rhyme tell 'em all of it's me when I hit the jump
Let 'em know I put my balls on the beat like Brennan Huff

[Torae]
Whenever you mention us, you can say we "Step Brothers" too
Or brothers from another, shout to my Philly dudes
But on the really dude, it's illy the way we do
The rhythm is straight to stool, don't make 'em like me and you

[Skyzoo]
True, dirty beats under intricate poems
While the rest of 'em makin records like they Winston Jerome
Me and Tor' get to breakin this pavement behind the gate
And the mirror says Jason and David in '98

[Torae]
We doin what y'all ain't, it's like the pen that paint y'all mural
You play Guitar Hero, I play the bar hero
And y'all zeroes never up on deck
We might do a full length, who gon' cut that check? (huh?)

[Chorus - Skyzoo] (Torae)
Wanted it, you got it (got it), heard all of the chitchat
Heard all of the rumors, (lookin to predict that)
Now you got the two of us, (who you know as true as us?)
Name another tag that can move with us [barrel brothers]

Wanted it, you got it (got it), heard all of the chitchat
Heard all of the rumors, (lookin to predict that)
Now you got the two of us (and who you know as true as us?)
Name another tag that can move with us [barrel brothers]</pre>
