[Lesley Gore 'You Don't Own Me' sample]
You don't own me... don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me... don't try to doubt, cuz I'll never change

[RZA]
You telling me where to go, what to smoke, what's a joke
How to sleep, how to eat, how to dress, how to vote
How to stress, how to smoke, how to vest, how to poke
Mostly, you trynna tell me, how to think, what a joke

[Lesley Gore 'You Don't Own Me' sample]
You don't own me... I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me... You don't own me...
You don't own me... You don't own me...

[RZA]
Keep your nose out of my business, and keep your eyes off my wizzes
Keep the game on those digits, and keep that butter on that biscuit
You acting like my name is Kunta, and yours is Mr. Smith
You see this four-fifth, it give your ass a face lift
Monkey with the guest list and that Z diamond necklace
Trying to front he's a Benz, son was in a Lexus
Acting like he New York, he was more like New Texas
Aww, man, boy, his whole style was wreckless
More like a mini-van, big with four cylanders
Got two hoes up in your chest, now, and it wasn't from no dillinger
The Shaolin Finger Jab, The Wu-Tang finger stab
Left him needing stitches, snitching like them bitches

[Lesley Gore 'You Don't Own Me' sample]
You don't own me... You don't own me...
You don't own me... You don't own me... I'm not just one of your many toys</pre>
