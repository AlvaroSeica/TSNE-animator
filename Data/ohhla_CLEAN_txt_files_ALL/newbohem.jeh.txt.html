[Verse 1]
Who's a loveable rogue known to compose colourful prose?
I'm on the road 'til my foot prints cover the globe
I speak low with a lump in my throat, and a lung full a smoke
Bunnin' dope in my humble abode, it's bohemia
Sepia tone memorabilia, soak up the media
Daytime TV's gettin' kinda tedious
Trapped with the social deviants
In the confines of my immediate
future is fruitless
I'm through duckin' shooters
Dust so thick it dates back to the Tudors
Livin' in student digs on tins of tuna
Who spent the rent down the boozer?
We sip beers and split hairs over current-affairs
Any unwelcome guests get chucked down the stairs
The place where I pedal my wares
All the fun of the fair
B-boys hold down the square, it goes

[Chorus]
Adventures in New Bohemia
Spark it everyday!
Adventures in New Bohemia
Cos that's the place we stay
Adventures in New Bohemia
We got to pay the rent
Adventures in New Bohemia
That's what we represent
Adventures in New Bohemia
Adventures in New Bohemia
Adventures in New Bohemia

[Verse 2]
Call me the counterfeit Big Lebowski, the part-time alchy
scramblin' around for his house key
Knee deep in debris sippin' on PG Tips like a chimpanzee
I'm the one-man jamboree, I won't ram out ya jam for free
I perform for a standard fee cos I'm freezin' cold
sleepin' with no central heatin'
I can even see mould growin' on the ceilin'
from my neighbours pipes that keep leakin'
In need of some herbal healin', I search and rummage
Eyes light up like rubies in a world of rubbish
Lookin' bummy like Wurzel Gummage, drunk and undernourished
Run ya gums and get rushed by the scrummage
The man with the dish-pan hands
Big band bustin' up ya tin pan jams

[Chorus]
Adventures in New Bohemia
Spark it everyday!
Adventures in New Bohemia
Cos that's the place we stay
Adventures in New Bohemia
We got to pay the rent
Adventures in New Bohemia
That's what we represent</pre>
