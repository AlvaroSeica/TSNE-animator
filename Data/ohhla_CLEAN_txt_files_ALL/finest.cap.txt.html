[Twista]
Nigga, I'm bout 4 seconds off yo ASS
When I get that itch, you betta pass, cause I'm ready to blast
Breaking them motherfuckers off when pistol pumpin hollow points
you ain't gonna LAST
Cause I'm bout to fuck you STRAIGHT UP
Shit I be dippin up in the club, my milla-meter go buck
Now you bogus as fuck, shit outta luck
I'm a murder your spot in yo GUT
And run up right beside of yo crib
Jus talkin bout shit you jus did, neva tellin the pigs
about the weapons and the work you put in to find where I hide my SHIT
Cause she was all on my DICK
Wonderin where I be hustlin and bustin niggaz on the Block
servin rocks, I was hot, but I to keep takin cause I had to get RICH
Now I got a lil BIT OF SCRATCH, Navigator and a 'llac
You be on a nigga back, said you tired of servin packs
You want me to front you a few G SACKS
so I broke you off a lil SOME SOME
Give a nigga high off one bum, from the jump, make yo body slump
make the Tempo pump, cause you servin dem GUMPS
From the Westside to the SOUTHSIDE
Because we be ready to ride, because we bout pride, what was Cowhide
Do what was hard, now high, we bout die 
Put him off the temp ready to hurt 'em
Now they mouth wide, we murders that will bust all of y'all
Togetha brotha, we ball or fall
Cap.One, bitch, shinin' to ya like I'm bout to draw
Windy City haters, fuck all of y'all

[Chorus 2X]
[Twista] To the gangstas and hustlers, Chi thugs, throw it up
while we smoke 5-bo lets get buck
[Rashawnna] Why we rollin to the westside?
Nigga let's ride to the Southside and roll 'em up
[Cap.One] And you know I can't forget bout 
my niggaz and bitches who had my back when I was out on the cut
[Twista] Hit the clutch, we bout to whip up the club
Trippin, we gonna pick up the punk

[Rashawnna]
How many niggaz wanna bust the gunshots
touch the glock, back on the block
for my niggaz that pop one shot
Murderious niggaz that put the barrel in yo mouth
and bury it outside, cop keys on the drive
Love, love all my bitches and thugs
that put a slug in any nigga that fuckin wit my blood
Hey, hate for any nigga for to stay
and for the fake niggaz fuckin wit J
I can't wait to KILL
Kill all nigga that will
This shit is real, when you up in the field, in my field
TAKE, Take a nigga life to see, how many niggaz wanna die for me
now motherfucker, wild WILD, is the home, holla Southside
and its on, I'ma ride wit my chrome, I'm a silent the chrome
take the whole world on my own
Nigga, I'ma die on the throne
Its the bitch that killed the shit
now fuckin wit this, I love you dicks
runnin up wit the dick, wanna lick
A big bitch, wit big dreams, and big shit
Fuck wit a nigga that put the gleam on the wrist
Killaz, wild ass niggaz, drug dealerz
motherfuckers that put lead all up in ya
Send you to bed, the bloodshed with the red to yo head, 
when you fuck wit guerillas

[Chorus]

[Cap.One]
Shit, I love when I get on the block not even goin thru a thang
spittin it for niggaz and bitches who holla my name
you feelin more pressure and pain
Niggaz is jealous and wanna step out of the game
you tellin me life is the same
I'm tellin you niggaz, you sheisty for the price of the fame
or have niggaz goin insane
Spittin it for niggaz and bitches who want me to reign
Enter the mind of a Don
Cap-to-tha-Dot-to-tha-One
nigga, who we pop wit the guns
on the block, all day, tryin to get my money right
Niggaz on the roof lookin out wit the ones
wit the ??? fucks, ice, I say get down on my nutts
Bounce wit a pound in the trunk
Fuckin wit some hoes, watch dem go up in the room
every nigga who I'm down gon bust
Hit it from the Don, blow dro quick wit the Chrome
blaze till Six in the Morn
Slide to the club
Hoes wanna show a nigga love
Shit, we can ride drinkin, Bone "Foe Tha Luv of Tha.."
Niggaz and bitches that push weight
and flip gates flick to da lake
Ballin C-A-P Dot, gun cock
Run in yo spot, lick shots and give a fuck
to da mallin (WHA)
So I be reppin da wild
Niggas in front with the tech and the crowd
Spit rhythms and get 'em buck wit many styles
get patience, what da fuck nigga we out
Den, you know I can't forget bout da crib
niggaz dat be wit me on da tip
Let 'em know that it's on, T and Shawn', Cap One who da Don
My niggaz got it on in this bitch

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
