(Chorus)
The mark of the beast
The mark of the beast.
Never ever ever take the mark of the beast.
The mark of the beast.
The mark of the beast.
Never ever ever take the mark of the beast.

(Bridge: Mondo)
The devil.
The devil's gonna try to stop the track
Keep on coming back man.  Keep on coming back.
The devil.
The devil's gonna try to stop the track.
Gotta hold him back man.
Gotta gold him back.

(Verse 1: Vex)
The devil sees the world as a girl from the back:
Eying, sighing.  Dying to get a crack at the middle.
So he kicks a quick little riddle.
She knos he's got game.  But she lets him feel and fiddle.
Her name's Earth.  Once a virgin.  But now demons got her split.
And Lucifer is next, to give the stunt a hit.
Got her moms to eat the evil apple back in the day.
Now he's got Earth bending in the 69'll slay.
The seed is in position, so he flips her in the mission.
Now her numbers 66 and he getting off his kicks.
He can't reach the climax for the shot of the sun.
Anti-christ traveling through the tract of his gun.
He thinks of the sex, and the "E" becomes an "I."
So now there's three 6's, and it's time for Earth to die.
She's addicted to the evilÂ…a frick to say the least.
And now she's giving birth to the mark of the beast.

(Mondo)
Now the seed is growing.  Flowing down the uterus or the core
Making the Earth hun-gr-y; making the hooker want some more.
Causing devilish offspring.  Fighting the message that we bring.
Defeating lives.  Striving on the many souls that can sing.
Hysteria.  Living in the area of strickly triple 6
You need the mark to buy your food, clothes, and kicks.
Niggaz pick 6, and live inside reflections of their flicks.
No looking back.  I know you feel the track my baby stick.
It's gonna be the nation under one groove.  The world under one move.
The christian followers temporarily lose.
But only in the in grill cause there's still more to fill my brother.
I tear as I watch the Devil's baby kill my mother.
Must I walk alone?  There's just too many stones in my path.
I can't stand the rain.  I feel the pain as he laughs.
I can't stand the rain.  I feel the pain as he laughs.
I can't stand the rain.  I feel the pain s he laughs.

(Chorus 2x)

(Bridge)
The Devil.
The Devil's gonna try to cut the track.
He can't hold us back.  He can't pull us back.
The Devil.
The Devil's gonna try to cut the track.
Here come the next attack man.  Here comes the next attack.  See?

(Verse 2: Mondo)
I hope my faith is strong enough to withstand until the ending.
I'd relly like to see this burn in the second sending.
The world is so dark.  All my friends have the mark.
'Cause nobody understands the consequences lies at heart.
I'd rather feel it now, 'cause life is temporary.  Pain is but a minute.

But eternal death is never finished.
Niggaz know I've never been the one to follow ill behavior.
I'll  never get the mark.  I'm just to smart.  I know the flavor.
It's the final test for the frontier.  N' the municiple
Is independent in the strength from the individual.
Voyage into Revelations 13 for a story.
[We] must unite and do what's right.  Don't receive the mark.

(Vex)
Now the rapture has come, and all the good in Earth has gone.
Satan's in the skin on the regular that's born.
Anti-christ is driving the insane.  Is he sadistic?
One bad baby raing hell.  The Devil's misfit.
He's growing up fast.  And getting worse with age.
Manifesting Revelations page by scary page.
Decieving all the people left behind in the dark.
Controlled by the beast as he's giving out the mark.

(Chorus 2x)</pre>
