Welcome to my terror dome
I'm glad to invite you, I'm your host, Flesh Bone
Niggas have come from ? in you when I ran in my thug zone
Been alone, and I can't see
Better trust nothin' but bustin' chromes
Daily, been so much drama
Feel like i'm cursed with karma that's not my own
So, I ask the Lord to guide my sight, keep me
don't leave my forsaken, will I make it through them gates
or will I burn off in that lake? 
When I feel the earthquake shake
And the dead awake, how many waited too late, it's over now
You niggas had a lack of faith
So life ain't straight if you incapable
Been havin' a little trouble, unable to fuel your soul
Better bleed the blood of Jesus
Watch how the majesty control, and don't let it go
Oh, no, hold on, now can I get a witness, shout Hallellujah
Amen, now fear that the holy ghost, make your move soon ya
Smoothe, i'm able to free your mind
With the rythm I got designed
When I roll, drop dimes
Let's go, you'll find there's no other like my kind

Amen, Amen If you've felt the struggles, say
... ... Amen, Amen, Amen

[Montell Jordan]
To all my thugs and my soldiers
We're living in a crazy world
It's gettin' colder, but ya keep on praying to God
Just like I told ya, and you will never walk alone
No, you will never walk alone

[Flesh]
Amen, Amen If you've felt the struggles, say
... ... Amen, Amen, Amen 

Sometimes I wonder, what kind of stud influence people under
And they bonkers from the loss
Can they tell when they see lightning strike
Thunder bolts, luminous, wet dooms day
Listen to me, y'all must be zombies, walkin' around all day
Can rhymes set off nuclear wars like Nam, me Armageddon
Flesh, ready, set, aim, let off lead
Leave all you demons dead in a ditch
Let's recite the scriptures from my holy book
You fled, better make my move, all y'all gotta die
Split up and fight, oh my
And the Lord's gonna walk rejoicefully by my side
Achieve, let's spit, and unfold two-seventy-three
Miraculously showed him the word he was born of
Shit finna get blown up, sho' nuff
Hold up when I go, buck, you better duck smoothly
move, snooze you lose, he ran outta luck, fucked
Look at him start cryin' the fuckin' blues
Baby, what would you do when you gotta live your life
Surrounded by so much madness
Be the madman, I am the pscycho
You may be reasons of my badness
Turn the page, if you don't wanna be burned, be saved
How many men got faith?
Then use it with authority, hurry, now break...

[Montell Jordan]
To all my thugs and my soldiers

No, you will never walk alone

[Flesh]
These are the scriptures of my book of thugs
Head over foot, we livin' in revelation
Could it be the end of the new beginnin'?
Descend to heaven's my destination
I'm gonna take you to another level
What part of the game is this you have? 
Have Flesh any mercy, not when this gunshot blast
My enemies wavin' the white flag
We the tightest, Trues Humbly United, my family never divide
We the survivors, mighty mighty Mo Thug riders
Here we come, still on the rise
If you knew what I know, this game tight
See if you can see what I see, believe it
Niggas, they see me, try to be me
Cause Flesh the realest T-H-U-G, Amen

[Montell Jordan]
To all my thugs and my soldiers
We're living in a crazy world
It's gettin' colder, but ya keep on praying to God
just like I told ya, and you will never walk alone
No, you will never walk alone.
