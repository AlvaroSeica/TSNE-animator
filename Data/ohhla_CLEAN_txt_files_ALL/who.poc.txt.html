[Mr. Shadow]
E-Dubb
We gon' talk it like this

(Verse 1)
Who drops that gangsta shit
And don't quit
Who's that bald motherfucker that be (???) your bitch (Who?)
I'm a sick motherfucker til the day that I'm gone
Me and my shadow on the balcony, hittin' the bong (Yeah)
Only the strong survives on these streets
Of Southern California, better know where this lead
We still bangin'
Aiming at your frame, cause you claiming
I just runnin' everythang, in this game that we playin'
You're weak
What you make in a year, I make in a week
I roll with motherfuckers that'll put you to sleep
Forever
In any weather, don't matter the time
You won't find another clique that is sicker than mine
This is westside, enemies hide and live in shelter
Lookin' like a mug with heat rocks that'll melt ya
I'm a let the world hear the unheard
And see the unseen, I am the latest word
Biotch

Chorus: Mr. Shadow
Who drops them gangsta hits and don't quit (Quit)
Who makes them haters split with real shit (Shit)
Who keeps the doobie lit with convicts
And gets, into shit, with glass metals or sticks (Who?)

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
When I slide on your side (What's up)
You all hide
Cause you know it's my show, put your ass on quiet time
A violent crime on this side of the line
One time, have a fit, when they see me in mine
Don't waste my time, cause it can get real nasty
That's to all you Marx
Claimin' you're gonna blast me
Pass me a bottle and a chronic sack
Where's all my motherfuckin' gangsters and my bitches at
The shit is phat
It's on like that
Little homies stay
Pimpin', big time and broke bitches don't know me
Show me what I came for, dollar bills with big faces
Big exchanges in abandonded places
Ransom cases
To the average fool don't know
The type of shit that makes a thug violate his parole
You best leave it alone
In the west, it's no lie
Still down to die for anything in my life
You motherfuckers

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Mr. Shadow {*E-Dubb scratching in background*}]
I'm a light this rocket
Yeah, so you stealing motherfuckers
Ask yourself who
Look behind you, bitch
Gon' be
Gonna ask you

(Verse 3)
It ain't nothin' to a boss (Hell nah)
You get tossed
Whenever you come across a bigger set of balls
Don't trigger me off, I ain't nothing to fuck with
And when I come through, buckin' ass, you better duck quick
Fuck this
It's a man's world and you're bitches
Dime dropping snitches
Your life is finished
Hun
I'm a menace
All about business
Stay out of mine or get served with stiffness
My shit list can go on for days
But there's too many motherfuckers to be mentioning names
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
Took 'em all deep in soil
Much love to all my peeps stayin' true and loyal
We live the life of a thug cause that's all we know
In the streets, bringin' heat, staying G for sho
SoCal in your mouth, westside of the states
Step aside or get walked on
In CA, yeah

Repeat Chorus Four Times</pre>
