Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm over to leave, but I think I want some more
I'm a nigga spinning, so bartender pour some more
Plus we getting faded, smoking on that hidden kuit
Bitches getting nugget, don't they know I hit and quit?

What you trying to do? You're looking like some trouble
Better run and get into, you hung on looking dead as fuck
So she can get it too, I ain't apologizing, I ain't sorry
Girl for touching on your body, cause I just came here to party

[Chorus]
If you been up in the spot and you need another shot
Say hell yeah, hell yeah
If the chick across the room dropping drop it like it's hot
Say hell yeah, hell yeah
If you party till the lights turn on
Tell the DJ play a new song
You ain't about to stop
Even if they call the cops
Say hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 2]
I see bottles on the table, Shawty on the Marley
With her piercing in her nipple, puffing like a marley
Soon everybody faded, even my haters
Cause they seeing me mugging at me got me saying

What you wanna do instead of causing trouble
Nigga here's what you should do
Go look around and find some hoes that you can get into
Cause I'm just out here trying to do the same
But I got the dully on me just in case you wanna bang

[Chorus]
If you been up in the spot and you need another shot
Say hell yeah, hell yeah
If the chick across the room dropping drop it like it's hot
Say hell yeah, hell yeah
If you party till the lights turn on
Tell the DJ play a new song
You ain't about to stop
Even if they call the cops
Say hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 3]
Check me out, check me out
I'm on some consider shit
Pocket full of dead presidents, but I ain't grieving, bitch
Married to the gang, that's forever, I ain't leaving
I know your man, don't put it down, cause you look like you need the D
One time for them haters, two times for them fakers
Three times for these bad bitches, we fucking all of them later
Yeah, hell yeah, getting money is my amo
But I don't pay for no pussy, I hope you got that memo
Tell hold on and don't let go
And then I treat the pussy like a rental
And I beat the pussy instrumental
Let's go, let's go

[Chorus]
If you party till the lights turn on
Tell the DJ play a new song
You ain't about to stop
Even if they call the cops
Say hell yeah, hell yeah</pre>
