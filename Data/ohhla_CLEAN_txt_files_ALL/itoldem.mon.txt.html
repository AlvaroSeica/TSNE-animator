[Chorus]
All we do is flex on that steroids
Bitch, watch that money stretch
Never knew nothing, now I'm stuntin 'cause I'm on
Probably turned around and he asked me where I'm gone
I told

Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes

[Verse 1]
Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes
I been gone off that liquor, I made it by that figures
Got my main bitch my top bat
My good batch I got that
I want that, I cop that
My money good I don't hide that
Got grip on my lap and my roof on my back
Strap from the east to the west side
Clip on my lap, fuck boys idea
Spin your stash like high
On these draws I whip
And them cars I don't test drive
I strap by my bed side
I dump off like bed time
Balls I get headshot
Straight on top my doll lick off shot
Talk chopper sound nigga, lift up the whole block

[Chorus]
All we do is flex on that steroids
Bitch, watch that money stretch
Never knew nothing, now I'm stuntin 'cause I'm on
Probably turned around and he asked me where I'm gone
I told

Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes

[Verse 2]
I don't care a sound let the sweetest sound I ever heard
I ain't talking about no cause, I ain't talking about no kilos
Where I'm from just don't phrase, I ain't no motherfucker hero
My shades up my tare's up, my toes down, my head's up
I ain't never put my legs up, my team's strong, my brick's up
My drug dealers pimp killers, all up in here
Chillers call dealer I be all up in here
Ain't real niggaz show me how to move and learn all
Now I get money fast, watch you niggaz burn slow
Talk boys we marley, them hoes be loving
Just a bunch of young niggaz thugging

[Chorus]
All we do is flex on that steroids
Bitch, watch that money stretch
Never knew nothing, now I'm stuntin 'cause I'm on
Probably turned around and he asked me where I'm gone
I told

Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes
Fuck away from these niggaz
Fuck away from these hoes</pre>
