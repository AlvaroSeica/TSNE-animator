"You know there's three kind of people in this world
That's why I know that change has gotta come
I said there's
There's white people; there's black people; and then there's my people"

[Verse 1: Asaviour]
It's the pure unadulterated hot shit
Liquid kiss of death, venomous toxic
Treacherous topic, cyanide scripts leave fools for dead men
I'm here to lock this
down with the rage, you must fear me now
Walk the lands with the ground breaking sound
Travelling from town to town
Spitting slang while the 12 spins round and round
Receive a pound then we out and it's homeward bound
Stating the page, obliterate pro's and nouns
Blockades pave a way for these patent shakedowns
I'm done with the who, what, where's and how's
It's the youth I'm saluting, it's the knowledge I've found
Cascades from the age, I was born to make waves
Walk forty nights, forty days to get paid
It's the pain I truncate to show you I care
Fumble with fear, fighting with the world but who cares?

[Chorus]
Pardon me, but this monotony
is killing off a part of me
It's part and parcel of my heart that bleeds partially

[Verse 2: Jehst]
I drop the nuclear letter bomb, pop the bottle of Evian
Now we got fans transfixed like planes at the Pentagon
Pen an epilogue for a cock with a semi-on, fuckin' with a demigod
Unleash the wrath of the renaissance
Elevate mind states to the next echelon
Save the children, grown men building
Women on our brains still blazin the chillum
I softly kill em' to the rhythm of life
Till the dark bring a vision of light
As I start grippin a mic and spittin a rhyme
It seems clich√©d, DJ's spinnin deep into the night
The day breaks, embrace the mayhem the AM creates
A grey place, rain on my face is acidic
Can't take the basic pace of living
I'm lettin' Satan break my spirit
Dejaal winnin em 'over now
Overcrowded, pump the loudest sound to fill out the houses
The roof is on fire tonight
Can't take it any higher tonight, right?

[Chorus]
Pardon me but this monotony
is killing off a part of me
It's part and parcel of my heart that bleeds partially
These bastards even wanna eat off our artistry
But they can hardly see what I see

[Verse 3: Diablo]
I spit saviour faire plus the timing's sick
Feel the rush like a junkie s fix
Got my eyes on tits, mind on clit
Strive to make the timeless hits
while your boys write the lifeless scripts
Don't take the piss, I'm totally bored 
with your war stories, trust me son I seen 'em all before
What I explore is the deepest level of creativity
Minds combined in perfect synergy
The strain on your brain, you can't get rid of me
I tackle terrain, it's part of my history
I hustle in vain, Blair got a piece of me
I'm burning in hell, my words yearn sympathy

[Verse 4: Jehst]
Faced with adversity, turn the TV
burn the tree till my eyes turn burgundy
Third degree heat, keep the fire lit
Play my theme on invisible violins
A bouquet of barbed wire, seven sins
Hyacinths withered in an iron fist
Strict italist, twist the pure weed
spit to raw beats, grey matter travels at warp speed
Greater than any before me
I force feed thoughts three courses, gourmet
Show weak minds the doorway
Step into a world of war games, face the warriors

[Chorus]
Pardon me but this monotony
is killing off a part of me
It's part and parcel of my heart that bleeds partially
These bastards even wanna eat off our artistry
But they can hardly see what I see

[Verse 5: Jehst]
I'm in the mainframe, blue flame blazin fuel
I ain't afraid of fools, I was raised by wolves
Killer caveman painting walls
with the blood of his enemies, utilising my basic tools
In an age of pagan rule, turn the page 
Amazing stories, going out in a blaze of fame and glory
Flames of furious anger, my form Manga
Walk with a panthers stride
Eye of the tiger, face to face
A leap of faith to complete the paper chase
Small change, slaves with more balls than brains
Ball and chain, angels that fall from grace
It's all the same like tears in the falling rain
See her face, her voice as she calls my name
I wake up to the maze, concrete locked in a cage
Off key jotting on a page for praise
My soul plainly displayed in a case with my name engraved
For all to gaze and take pity
The last battle of the great city, the last pages of history </pre>
