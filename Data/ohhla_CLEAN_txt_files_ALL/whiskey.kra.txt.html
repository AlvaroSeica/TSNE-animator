Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright
You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright

I'm on the run, the devil's tryin to get me
Says I met him at a pawn shop down in Mississippi
I was an angel lookin for another face
I must a bumped my fuckin head when I fell from grace
I found a place in the sun like Stevie
And now I gotta wonder cause the rain don't believe me
I need to breathe, take the money and run
I put my faith in one place and now I'm fuckin done

You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright
You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright

I could a been a saint, but I choose the wrong path
I ain't no dummy, take the money and laugh, Uh
I got the cash, did the dash for the door
Now I'm sittin on my stash and I'm feelin like a whore
I'm torn, but can't think, I blink so I miss
I move in strange ways, I move to dismiss
I'll leave this place and when I do that's it
I don't need to conclude so you can keep that shit

You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright
You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright

Uh, I'm headin south an Old Whiskey Road
Livin life like a story that doesn't need to be told
It's gettin old, always runnin from the past
I'm lookin at myself in the bottom of a glass
I won't last, my lights too dim, h
I seen the future and it's lookin pretty grim, Uh
I'm gonna win, but not like that
So I'm takin what I got and I ain't never comin back

You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright
You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright
You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright
You put some whiskey in the water
Gonna run off with your daughter
And if I make it to the border
I'm gonna be alright</pre>
