Song:   In My Head
Typed by: Knowledge God

[Chorus: Long Axe]
I can walk and don't touch no pavements
Looking like my pain don't grow, I don't show no aging
My mother land is Asian
Sometimes when I write I don't use no spacing

[Long Axe]
The average go where the world don't know
Maybe they grow into the life five seconds from the photo
Crash into me so we can bond as one
That meticulous rhythm is beyond the Sun
Come, expand with the lungs, never ran with fun though
In my own head I'm just sitting in the front row
My mind work I got paid to hurt
That poetry fed from the days I search
Meanwhile, self style, soft tones, light colours
Ran from the blood from these black brothers
Mixtures of pictures and visual tones
Hypnotic textures makes you feel all alone

[Chorus]

[Long Axe]
They say, Axe leave the shell to be welcome to Hell
Keep my gods up stars up, started out well
Maybe I can sell the details to my ideas
Kept them inside for nine years
They was holding back tears don't even cry alone
Many personalities, I won't die alone
I'm a cosmic icon, General Quan the don
A don this, a don that
Never look back on the tracks til I heard my train of thought coming
I refused to walk from it and I stop running
Without a body you can stop fronting
Like a deep warm place, I salute the inner space
Growing old with grace, even if it's just a taste
I saviour what the others don't favour
Passion is the sum of all labour
When lesson seems greater, I'ma see my folks later
Meditate the cold train with no pain
In my head is no pain

[Chorus]</pre>
