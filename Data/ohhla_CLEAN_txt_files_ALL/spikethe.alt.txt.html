[A.L.T.]
(Verse 1)
Spike the punch
The definition of a rap jam
An emcee is on the stage, and I'm ready to slam
It's A.L.T., I got the mic, I got the info
I'm gettin' crazy with the hotties, hypin' bodies with a nympho
Feelin' tipsy, plus I'm gettin' lips, G
When I'm in a rhyme, yo, the time kind of slips me
Cause the punch is spiked up
The crowd is hyped up
The last emcee got wiped up
And we don't need the coppers
It's just me, a bunch of women and a lot of hip hopsters
All the ladies in the house
With the mini-skirts and a low-cut blouse
Lettin' it in, and I will turn it out
Because the body went ZIP and BOOM about
Now
You wanna get it on, I got a hunch
Give it a chance, just dance, and you'll be
Spikin' the punch

[Crowd]  SPIKE THE PUNCH
[A.L.T.] Spikin' the punch
[Crowd]  SPIKE THE PUNCH
         SPIKE THE PUNCH
[A.L.T.] Spikin' the punch

(Verse 2)
"Just dance," is what I requested
Big breasted, I should be arrested
For what I'm thinkin', drinking
A big fat glass
Lookin' at the honey with a big phat ass
The outin' to the middle
The middle of the riddle
She was lookin' fly, but I wouldn't play a little
Kittle fell in love, so I had to think quick
Said a slick rhyme, now the chick is on my Dickies
Style pants is what I'm wearin'
Black Vans, locs, flannel shirt, and my hair in
A net
Now, I never played a cholo
I'm just a Mexican kid, and I had to go solo
As for the rhymes, I got a bunch
And if you give me the chance to dance, I'll be
Spikin' the punch

[Crowd]  SPIKE THE PUNCH
[A.L.T.] Spikin' the punch
[Crowd]  SPIKE THE PUNCH
         SPIKE THE PUNCH
[A.L.T.] We'll be spikin' the punch

(Verse 3)
[A.L.T.] Here we go, I'm on a go, I'm on the flow
         Lookin' for the hon's with the buns, and she gotta be a whole
         Lot of woman, but she gotta give it up
         You see
         You only live once, so come on, honey, live it up
         Home boys, if you want it for lunch
         Then say, "Spike the punch"
[Men]    SPIKE THE PUNCH
[A.L.T.] Ay yo, ladies, if you wanna get crazy
         Say, "Spike the punch"
[Ladies] SPIKE THE PUNCH
[A.L.T.] Here we go, I'm a hit the store by 4:10
         I got Tequila and the whisky and the 90 Proof gin
         Then
         I mix it all together
         Clever
         And if you don't wanna taste, cool
         Whatever
         I don't wanna push it
         But if you wanna push it
         Then we can get sneaky, kind of freaky on the cushion
         Pushin'
         And I'll do it to the groove
         {*saxophone*}
         Yeah, smooth
         And then
         I'll eat her for lunch
         And if you give me the chance to dance, we'll be
         Spikin' the punch

[Crowd]  SPIKE THE PUNCH
[A.L.T.] Spikin' the punch
[Crowd]  SPIKE THE PUNCH
         SPIKE THE PUNCH
[A.L.T.] We'll be spikin' the punch

[Both]   SPIKE THE PUNCH
[Men]    SPIKE THE PUNCH
[Ladies] SPIKE THE PUNCH
