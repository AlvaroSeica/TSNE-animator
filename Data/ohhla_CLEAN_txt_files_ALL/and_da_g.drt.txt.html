[Chorus - Mr. G'stacka]
Now it's the pimp and the gangsta, stackin cheese 
And we ain't rollin unless we sittin on 20 inch D's 
We slide wit ease and everyday we gettin high wit weed 
We ride wit G's and movin on up from O's to ki's
 
(Big Pimp)
I was that'same pimp that y'all use to call
hey lil fat daddy 
and I'm still fat 
now I'm pushin a pretty ass fat caddy 
I ain't livin lavvy shit
I had to hustle to stack this mil  
every car that I rolled out 
triple deal wheels to match my grill
How you haters feel
to see the pimp and the gangsta ridin off this here?
my diamond grill shinin from eastern mall all the way to western hill 
we got yo bloody cause dem dirty boys we slangin steel 
at times we movin keys cross county lines to make em peel 
now our safe can t close up 
you probably got sum D's
but my spokes be gold n
you probably got sum  dimes bro 
but mine be swole up 
you probably got sum rhymes
but pimpin to be so cold da
you probably got sum optimos 
but none to roll up 
you probably got sum ice 
but mine be froz n
you probably got a gul bro 
but mine be rolled up 
you probably got a caddy player 
but mine be smoked up 
 
(Mr. G'stacka)
I'm slangin dem keys pickin up G's rolling through the gump  
I know you jock that 
the police watch that  
this young gangsta dipped in chocolate
and they can t stop that 
so pass the brew and just keep drankin 
we ball for all thisis
we holla boss
we neva fall 
we bankin wit'shankin 
any hater that's talkin bout gankin 
he must quit thankin 
now the results of this is bullets slangin 
we love that bangin 
so look here mayn Don't come here wit that bullness
cause if you start to actin hard I'm gon have to pull this 
a full clip that's about to explode 
oh, you didn't know ?
it's dem boys dirty, dirty 
act n wit dirty, dirty
he go by that bloody, bloody
six feet deep in muddy, muddy 
you neva was my buddy 
and ain't nann out there can hurt me 
trust me 
believe that 
it's Mr. G who is speakin 
dem pluggas I left dem tweakin 
yo broad I left her leakin 
I'm creepin 
on another level 
I know you feel this 
the pimp and the gangsta 
ask yo self 
now who s  the realest 
 
(Chorus - Mr. G'stacka)
Now it's the pimp and the gangsta, stackin cheese 
And we ain't rollin unless we sittin on 20 inch D's 
We slide wit ease and everyday we gettin high wit weed 
We ride wit G's and movin on up from O's to ki's
 
(Chorus - Big Pimp)
Now it's the pimp and the gangsta, stackin cheese 
And we ain't rollin unless we sittin on 20 inch D's

(Mr. G'stacka) 
I'm leanin back and rollin up the window, we blowin indo 
creepin up through the hood hittin up my kinfolk 
and if you didn't know I'm the same G they call lil skinny 
No longer skinny, but I'm pushin an expedition on 2O's 
And it's plenty wood in my sack, and that's a fact 
Playa we roll em fat, dem big ol ball bats 
Oh yes, we call em that, I love to stack and ball dogg 
Don't you recall dogg the same boss that had dem bodies hauled off
from the sawed off 
and they'all lost
so they payed the cost  
and that's a nice price 
cause I'm always with my folks 
wit the black hats tilted to the right 
at night, we breed 
and you best believe you gonna bleed 
if you step to Mr. G or 
the P-I to the M to the P  
Take heed because we grind too, let me remind you 
I know the name is Dirty but look here we like to shine too
Smoke pine too and neva fake neva roll shake 
cause we smoke mo blunts then our lungs can take
continue to hate and catch two A.K. shells to your face 
Ain't got no time to waste so playa stay away from our place  
You'll get a taste, cause I'll leave yo whole life a disgrace 
cause it's the pimp and the gangsta wreckin towns in your state  
 
(Big Pimp) 
it's the pimp and the gangsta 
quick to gank ya fo yo dope
it's the pimp and the gangsta
Slangin wood, heroin, and coke 
it's the pimp and the gangsta
Servin dem junkies till they croak 
it's the pimp and the gangsta
Mackin dem hoes leavin em broke 
it's the pimp and the gangsta
Doin the same thang before 
pushin a Lac wit triple gold D's 
blazin treez and slangin dope 
now everyday we smokin killa weed 
slangin dust from coke or treez 
on the grind every goddamn week 
just to sport dem 20 inch D's 
take that dope, mix enough 
cook it let it bubble up 
if it's not rockin up 
then you must got to much cut 
po it out, try again
now you got to buy sum mo 
now you got to up yo price 
cause you done fucked up yo dope 
hit the block

cause you tryin to flo yo tea
you aint got to sweat the curb cause you went from O s to ki's 
 
(Chorus - Big Pimp)
Now it's the pimp and the gangsta, stackin cheese
