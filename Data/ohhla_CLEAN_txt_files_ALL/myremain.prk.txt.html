Song:   In My Remains
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chester Bennington]
Separate
Sifting through the wreckage
I can't concentrate
Searching for a message
In the fear and pain
Broken down and waiting
for a chance to feel alive

[Chorus One]
Now in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Chester Bennington]
Come apart
Falling in the cracks
of every broken heart
Digging through the wreckage
of your disregard
Sinking down and waiting
for a chance to feel alive

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: repeat 4X]
Like an army, falling
One by one by one

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two] - 1/2</pre>
