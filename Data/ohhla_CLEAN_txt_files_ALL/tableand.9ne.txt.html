Song:   Table and Chest Stress
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I'm here to give you my table and chess stress
life is so full of fear like an A-I-D-S test
when you're covered in wet sex
with no glove you just vexed
'cause life is so less blessed
feel like death is the best bet
I'm here to give you my table and chest stress
life is so full of fear like an A-I-D-S test
when you're covered in wet sex
with no glove you're just vexed
'cause life is so less blessed
feel like death is the best bet

[Verse 1]
I mean, ain't no way up out of this dream
nowhere to skip a scene not with all them demons stuck on the screen
so many unrest I bring serene living within means green
but things seem bleak
I'm beesteemed for the kings team
major corporations firin' I feel obligated to hire 'em
higher desired I'm wired my empire is tiresome
but if she fly I'll invite her to my asylum
alumni find relaxation off in a bonsai
this bad season got me in my past sneezin'
seeing the muthafucka singin taking a nina away but I guess they had reasons
'till I had freakin ash leakin' nap seepin' Crash deacon
givin' a sermon off my sick and twisted class teachin
you see now this ain't no fuckin freestyle
my people startin' to eat now with the Angela Yee gal and Phillip chow
niggas is ready to freak out
yea I got a little money to piece out
to some but the rest be plottin' on me wanna stick me up like a decal

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
My Hungarian honeys locked up for manslaughter
now her mother and father cant even hug their damn daughter
such an insane part of life when life really became harder
only way they saw me in jail was to visit Dwayne Carter
then I'm off in Spain sort of lame 'cause no dame saw us
never did play with the labia
all I ate was paella
then ex bitches its all part of the Tech riches
so I get vicious,they know I keep with the best bitches
then I sex with it
to bend her over the table is less stress
with no bra and her breast on the table her chest pressed
my people fallin' while I continue to jet set
but I got the power to bless
the beat bangin' yea Tech nigga</pre>
