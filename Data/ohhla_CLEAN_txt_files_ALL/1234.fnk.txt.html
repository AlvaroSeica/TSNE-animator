Mr. Bu Bu back, back in the place
So hook up with the groove, the phat, phat bass
Rougher than rough on the richter scale
Bop-bop-bop place a map in hell
High way, our way, hip-hop hooray
Say what, what, what, what the (uh) you say
Old school, so you know I don't play
Knock em out the box just like Sugar Ray

You don't like it, so what, I don't care
I wanna battle but it's not a fair play
I've got a million styles, baby, baby
Schizophrenic, no, definately, maybe
You got static, the company tells me
Automatic is the key behind the game see
But even if they didn't know
I'd still be the sure shot master of the ceremony

One and two and three and four
Come on, come on, what ya waiting for
Let me know if you want some more
Bomfunk MC's gotta rhyme galore
One and two and three and four
Come on, come on, what ya waiting for
Let me know if you want some more
Bomfunk MC's gotta rhyme galore

Flow, flow, flowing once again
Mr. funky rhyme throwing down so good, it's bad
Like a, like a, like a lake with a deck
So now you gots to get with an audio no new chapter
You trapped to the track, you want more
Oh shit, I got you knocking on my door
Beam me up, beam me up, beam me up Scottie
Or I might get naughty and funk that body

Uh, uh, uh, holy hottie
Uh, uh, uh, holy hottie
Uh, uh, uh, holy hottie
Groupies, they're down with everybody

One and two and three and four
Come on, come on, what ya waiting for
Let me know if you want some more
Bomfunk MC's gotta rhyme galore
One and two and three and four
Come on, come on, what ya waiting for
Let me know if you want some more
Bomfunk MC's gotta rhyme galore

I'm like mad scientist on new territories
So never explored there, yeah, just heard stories
Homies surround the rough lyrical terrorist
The B to the O to the W is
Watching for your bass so I pass the test
In any old bad ass MC contest
This is the only scratch so you know we come fresh
*Scratching*

One and two and three and four
Come on, come on, what ya waiting for
Let me know if you want some more
Bomfunk MC's gotta rhyme galore
One and two and three and four
Come on, come on, what ya waiting for
Let me know if you want some more
Bomfunk MC's gotta rhyme galore</pre>
