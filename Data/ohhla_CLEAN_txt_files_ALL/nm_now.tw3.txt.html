[Verse 1]
Surrounded by smoke my self identity feelin' nobody feelin' me
Nightmares be killin' me no different from reality
Picture us trapped, in a desert where niggas sticky and hot
Hot, broke and confused wid a extra clip for a glock
Why, nobody needin' nobody like I,
Livin' life confused and high when evrything die
Am I wrong for my own thinkin',
Do they like or hate me for the wrong reasons
When I can't control my alcohol drinkin'
Somebody close put some lead on me,
I never figured I get shot, more different times by my own homies
A crazy world that we livin' in,
Fuck friends nigga you work when you givin' in
Then they said freedom til them bastards rott
They said hustle til your basket crop,
My nigga thug til the casket drop
So I live watchin' my enemies,
Cause this world ain't no kin to me
And nobody no friend to me
Ridin' bucket, my middle finger symbol fuck it
While clutchin' the glock forty trigger livin' the way I love it
Light can't even take me alive,
It cost more to survive than workin' 9 to 5
My nigga picture your dreams up on a triple beam
And want it bad like a dope fiend, want crack, nigga stack cream,
And keep your eyes on your enemies why,
Real niggas know they live to die
And it seems nothin' really matters now
But I wasn't killed, thank God but still it's hard to be positive
No love when I ain't buckin' on my life alright,
Even though I bled from a gunfight
And who really cares if they don't understand
I'm a confused black man in this crime land
Snortin' lines ah funk damn I need weed just to calm down
Can't sleep or eat or put my gun down
And they tellin' me what to be or what they see
Through my shinin' eyes hopin' I help 'em if I did rise
But who gon' be off in my corner when I'm fallin' back
Like them niggas that I'm deep wid and ain't callin' back
They got no love for me, and Lord knows they don't care for me
Cause He the only one there for me,
But they don't wanna see me get out wild
When I'm at the point ah no return
Nothin' in the world really matters now
Cause I was,

[Hook]
Shot down but I wasn't killed
One life to live, thank God but still it's hard to be positive
No love when I ain't buckin' on my life alot
Retaliation on the pop, so it's understood

[Verse 2]
Let's take a journey through my mind's eye
I can't explain how I feel watchin' time fly
A dirty game am I wrong for my desperation
To stack mil gettin' high makin' crack sales and black males
Sixteen snort cocaine, wid mean mugs on they face afta the last drain
A damn shame it's the full moon, I hope to God I don't die soon
Runnin' through wid speed like a typhoon
Maybe the answer in The Book loc, dictionary thick
When I ain't never learn shit but how to cook dope
And I ain't never knew no national anthem, or no bullshit propaganda
Cause I'm to busy throwin' tipper tantrums
You wonder why they call me Gemini I can't lie,
So many signs to my mind's eye,
Wish I could fly and just spread my wings and be free in the breeze
Maybe that's why I smoke weed
And nothin' really matters now

[Hook]
But I wasn't killed
One life to live, thank God but still it's hard to be positive
No love, when I ain't buckin' on my life alot
Retaliation on the pop, it's understood

Shot down but I wasn't killed
One life to live, thank God but still it's hard to be positive
No love, when I ain't buckin' on my life alot
Retaliation on the pop, it's understood
