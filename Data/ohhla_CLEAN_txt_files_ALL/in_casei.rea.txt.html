Typed by: westbingmanson@gmail.com

[Intro]
In case I don't wake up
This for fallen niggas that didn't wake up
For my hardass motherfuckin niggas represent we ride
In case I don't wake up
It's a fucked up world we livin' in y'all
Something's gotta change [x3]

[Verse One]
I get crooked when I, hang with G's like Swoop
And at times, I'm doing shit that I know I shouldn't do
My mama told me one thing the first day I was born
She said "I love you baby", I said, "Damn my life is torn"
I'm taking photographic pictures of death
Walking the streets, screaming last circle
Like I'm the last one left
And if I do die God can you promise me this?
Tell my nephew, that I died the fuckin' realest
Welcome back to the life that never gave me much
And when I do die, I want my homies keepin' in touch
Forget about the beefs we often had, and muthafuck the police
Throw off your green and blue flags and represent
Nigga, verbally I kill on sight, I pray to God cause I hope I don't die tonight
But then I might, so I choose to do things, that I might not do
Bustin' my guns and fuck a curfew

[Chorus]
In case I don't wake up
I want all my homies keepin' in touch
I want the baddest bitches knowin' to fuck
In case I don't wake up
I want the motherfuckin' world to know
I represent westside death row
In case I don't wake up
I want all my homies keepin' in touch
I want the baddest bitches knowin' to fuck
In case I don't wake up
I want the motherfuckin' world to know
I represent westside death row
In case I don't wake up

[Verse Two]
I got the world ass-hyped, one of the homies got mashed on
Plus I'm outta town, witta Hallowe'en mask on and blasted on 'em
Never forgive without apology, I'm on the phone
Call us some niggas that come to robbery, it's hard to see
How life feel with much turmoil, I'm sippin' Crown Royal when I ride
To make my blood boil, I'm tryna scrawl
Any niggas probly with a passion I'm asking
only one time, before I shoot who done it?
Alla sudden, somebody pulled a technical foul, know it's wild
Because we just might have to murder the child
Or at times, nobody knows, I wonder will I wake up, only God knows
Too much pressure, I'm sittin' by the dock of the bay
Pumpin the doobie, when you do it's gon' be okay
Let's get our money nigga, show 'em how the South ride
You know we only live, so we all gotta die

[Chorus]
In case I don't wake up
I want all my homies keepin' in touch
I want the baddest bitches knowin' to fuck
In case I don't wake up
I want the motherfuckin' world to know
I represent westside death row
In case I don't wake up
I want all my homies keepin' in touch
I want the baddest bitches knowin' to fuck
In case I don't wake up
I want the motherfuckin' world to know
I represent westside death row
In case I don't wake up

[Verse Three]
I gotta holla at Dee Marcus, Lauren Hurway, and Roscoes
Some hoes of mine who died, in this world fulla scandalous hoes
R &amp; R, from stunt to stunt just out to smoke a free-free,
I wish that y'all can see that I grown to be an O' G
And Michael, Kyle, playa, Big Red, and homie R.Johnay
It's my duty to put it down for y'all until my dying day
Cause crime pays, and at times, push my homeboys down
And funeral homes, watchin' all they families cryin'
I can't stand it, how politics are killin' each other
It wasn't meant for the east and west coast to be fight each other
But it's too late nigga to turn back, so you grab your strap and cock back
Nigga, where else you at? (go go go)
I'm representing til your casket drops
I remember the days when my nigga
walking through and get shot by these punk ass cops
And please just understand my lifestyle
I came from a broken home so I can never smile

[Chorus]
