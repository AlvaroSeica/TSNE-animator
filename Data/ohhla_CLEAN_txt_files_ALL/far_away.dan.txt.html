[Chorus: Collette]
Though you're far away
I won't ever let you go
I won't let you slip away
Where we'll wind up, I don't know
Though you're far away
It feels like you're oh so close
Closer than I was yesterday
I'll continue down this road

[Danny!]
Muh'fuckers wanna act loco
Pretend like I ain't spittin when I rap dope though (yeah)
Treat me like I'm invisible (Why's that?) Hell if I knew!
Tryna X me out the game, what the hell did I do?
Who the hell did I piss off? The powers that be 
to keep me from fulfilling my dreams
Must be the karma that's makin it so damn harder
Was smart, but I gotta work smarter
I used to ride the MARTA, now I ride the wave of increments
Calculated moves work the +Texas Instruments+
Seems every step that I +Take+, I lose +6+
But the only thing I love is making music
A federacy, but every other year
it gets embedded in me these niggas better than me
Reinforced by the media, believe in the hype
to hear 'em tell that I'm a relic if you're readin it right
But even the Jiggaman was damn near 30
when he finally got his shine - I'm only 29!
So maybe I'ma reach the stars in due time
I admit that it helps when I see the signs
In January I was hangin at the end of a stream
'til ?uestlove took me under his wings
But it's gonna take more than a couple of tweets
and a Pitchfork blurb, the rest up to me
So if I have to be the next big thing
twenty years in a row, I'ma give it a go
I've gotta finish this yo, but people get confused
I aspire for more so I can inspire more
Try to be the opening act, don't treat me like a hypeman!
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this pressure
People ask 'em keep up the rappin, speaker don't have it
Dreams, reach up and grab 'em like I'm almost there
What the fuck?

[Chorus]

("Love you baby"
