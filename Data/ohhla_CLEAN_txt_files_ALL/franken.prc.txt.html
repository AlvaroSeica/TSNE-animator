[Sean Price]
Yo; yo
One for the money, two for the dough
Three for the paper, that's all that I know
Broke with a job, a crook with the cash
You be hopin to God I don't put my foot in yo' ass
Got my foot on the gas, and I'm runnin the red
Put this pack in your ass, I just gun your dreads
Never go on the block, like I used to do
Why go on the block, all of my niggaz moved
Mister Boom Bap Rap, whatever, the black leather
match the black Nike Venoms, so nice that my wife be in 'em
P! Body the Grape, Ape eighth probably break
one eighth of your face off, break North
Uhh - fake and soft pa, and I hate all of you
Punch you in the face now you able to taste barbecue
Hard to do this, I'm doin me
You can do what you do just don't do it in front of P
P! Personally it's nothin personal
You send a verse for me, I'll send a hearse to you
Clearly it's that - the realer you act
I'm actually, one of the rappers that really can rap

[Buckshot]
Uh-huh; one for the money, two for the dough
Three for the paper, that's all that I know
You call that a show, it's more of a circus
You tryin to hear Buck flow, still callin 'em nervous
You fall for the service, you fall on your face
Judgin shit backwards, stop callin this case
Now I'm all in your space, cause I'm outta this world
And if I show what's on my plate, say goodbye to your girl
She really a bird, cause you givin her seeds
Then leave, now she expect the same shit from me
Please! Use your knees for a stand
You got a big mouth, now who deemin my little man
Damn~! It's a new pedestal that I sit on
Son, I'ma shit on better stools
The tools, that I use two hammers
One for the nail in your coffin, the next for your life after

[Sean Price]
Personally, it's nothin personal
You send a verse to me, I'll send a hearse to you
Clearly it's that - the realer you act
I'm actually, one of them rappers that really can rap
I'm actually, one of them clappers that actually strapped
I'm actually, runnin with Africans traffickin smack
I'm actually, smackin the nap off your faculty jack
Exploitin the black, nigga nap Cadillac rap
Uhh - fake fuck, I will fuck up your face
Fuck face fingers, fuck trigger nigga the ape - P!
GOOD NIGHT FOLKS</pre>
