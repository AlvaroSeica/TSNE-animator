[Intro: repeat 2X]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puertro Rican, or Hatian
Black, white, or Mediterranean (ALL EM!)
Middle Eastern or Asian
Alls I'm sayin, alls I'm sayin

[Donwill]
Instinct is sayin go with my gut (go with your gut)
I ain't the type to run up like, "what up!?" (ay whatup?)
It's fight or flight and the battle is love
I'm tryin to win or live to fight again
At the first sight of skin it's like the hood go crazy
Her eye contact reads like she okayed me
But hey let's say we get a bit more familiar
You should meet Donald if you like Donwill, ehh
Kinda corny I guess but it was worth the smile
I'm doing numbers right now just tryin to work the crowd
I'm new in town quite often, I move around
like a new school 'Pac, Digital Underground
Eff the runaround is you is or is you ain't?
As for babes gotta Flocka Flames' hard in the paint
I can't complain it's lookin good, bet you make it better
Let's see what you can do... if I let ya
(And if I let ya)

[Chorus: Outasight]
She went out west to Hollywood
To be a star, didn't get too far no
And now she's right back in the hood
Wit all dem girls yeah - this one's for you!
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
All them girls a-round the world
And then I say
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
All them girls a-round the world
It's for you

[Von Pea]
Now I don't know much about wine, suits and fine dining
but, I'll bet a G on your spot and I'll find it (I'll find it)
No lie chick; I ain't too shy to try shit
Don't be too fly for my shit
I'ma keep an eye on her like Mishka
'til I'm en route like I root for the 6ers
I get over and you actin all casual
But you've straightened up your bedroom, haven't you?
Listen y'all, I was schooled in the 12th grade
Forget game, she already got her mind made
I dig you - so after I'll stay
Order takeout and watch the outtakes
I ain't scared of it, I'm aware of it
I've invested and bought shares of it (word)
You inspire me - your other half's what I strive to be
That don't get it, that's fine with me

[Chorus]

[Outro] - same as [Intro]</pre>
