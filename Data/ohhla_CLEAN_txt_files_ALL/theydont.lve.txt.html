[Chorus One: Rico Love]
They don't know - they don't, they don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't know - they don't, they don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't know - that we'd be in the same room, we don't ever say shit
Let's keep it between me and you, and we cool (cause they don't know)

[Rico Love]
I'm the one you be textin' when you be up at your job (they don't know)
I'm the one that brought that Benz that's in your garage (they don't know)
I'm the reason you don't stress when shit gets hard
And anything you want, it's all yours (they don't know)
On your birthday I'm the one who saw your birthday suit (they don't know)
Got that Birkin bag and bought that birthday coupe (they don't know)
I keep it all real, I ain't gotta tell lies to you
You're the only one who knows.. the truth

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: Rico Love]
They don't, they don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't know - they don't, they don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't know; they don't even know I know you, you don't be talkin' like a lame bitch
You follow the rules, but keep it cool (cause they don't, know)

[Rico Love]
We was at the same hotel Superbowl and All-Star week (they don't know)
You be actin' shy but you're really an all star freak (they don't know)
That you got my name tattooed on your body
They don't know you belong to me, yeah (they don't know)
About the code names and the secret island trips (they don't know)
When I be up in that pussy, I be callin' you my bitch (they don't know)
They don't know you like me, they don't know you like me
They don't even know that I share you.. with my wifey

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Rico Love]
Heh.. you deserve the rewards
G5 planes, you deserve the board
Tell them all the lames they can swerve of course
And I swear to God I'mma curve the broads
Cause they don't - know
Vacations, they don't - go
You stay patient and I respect that
Cause you know how to play your - post
Them other bitches get antsy
That's why a nigga never treat em fancy
You get shoes off in Bergdorf
while they bargain shoppin on DelancÃ©
You ain't even to your sister
Mama thinkin' you don't even like niggas
Instagram, you don't even like pictures
That's why I'm fuckin' with ya, hahaha

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Rico Love]
They don't, they don't know...
They don't, they don't know...
Cause they don't, know...</pre>
