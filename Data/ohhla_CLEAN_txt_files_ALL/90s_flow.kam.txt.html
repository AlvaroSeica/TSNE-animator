90's Flow
Malah

(Hook) 2x
Welcome to the oasis, the flow gracious
Big ol' chains, and fat laces
UFO rap shit, flyin' somethin' spacious
But they ain't ready for that
Back to the basics

[Chief Kamachi]
Old gem rare book of charms with the gold trim
Masterpiece, who are you insulting?
4,000 years ago I started sculpting
They've burned all the libraries down and killed the Sultan
Light in the world came on, I plugged the volt in
Clean white cloth, the priest is here consulting
Three dirty pennies predict they won't win
Two shots left but bet I'm goin' slumpt in
Master of mystical war, look at how I function
Watch how Saturn and Mars make a conjuction
All black, fuck the police, Straight Outta Compton
Back to the Liberty Bell we still stomping
What was your assumption? Ground get stomped in
Malah, it's not the jungle you wanna jump in
Kill ya self, better yet in hell slumped in
My voice in the radio box, I'm still pumping

(Hook) 2x

[Chief Kamachi]
They call me Pop Shango; see how the rhyme go
Serpent in the rainbow, invinsible ensable
Deadly combo, lyrical shake conga
City streets bit by the teeth of great mamba
Let the lions loose on the long range entanto
Lives from the African hut look like a condos
Supply all the jewels you wear at a rhyme show
Came from the Motherland take 'em back pronto
Caught up in the tropical storm without a poncho
Your shit deep up ship creek is where the comp go
Never gave a fuck about OJ and the Bronco
House nigga hit up, drown in the swamp slow
Lookin' grim blot, pockets on slim float
Camels fly tin tote, bullet hole Jim Crow
First love in life, murdering a racist
Dozens of black roses covering their faces

(Hook) 2x

Yeah
