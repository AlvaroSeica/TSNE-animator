[Intro: Kevlaar 7]
Yeah, Thought for food volume two
The mixtape, Go get it
You know what the fuck it is
Yeah, Bronze Nazareth
Hazardous, To your health

[Kevlaar 7]
Yo, My tongue is a hammer let grammar get you touched
The camera's a crutch, My image is unseen
Visible only when God agrees
It's deemed July black, Original lineage
Blood spillage, I'll pillage your cells
In the jails and they graves
Pay the Devil back for Shawn Bell
Kevlaar keeps spit heat, In form of coral reef
That's where I bury your bones and leave headphones
So the world can hear you scream

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, I safe as the face is ugly, Rhyme rugby
Catch a nigga on time with the knife and scully
From masses that blast and cut short your ???
Smoke funk like smorg your criminal court is useless
Slow words puddle like pussy juices
No loose leaf, Baby run back for the abuses
Rap smack, Endless grace, Spoon full hat trick
Attic attack, Blow her back on the mattress
From Gun Rule where rusty tools work like matches
Line for line, Sonograms that disturb the axis
Love you like blood on the Kotex when I can't afford it
I'ma short wick bout my money clip
I was raised reamin Michigan style, But it was Bo Ric's
Crime paid ransom money, The calculations fit
He dry snitched they migrate to fried fish
Send Africa a kite to see through ancestor's tint
Can't call my Grandmother who left Pop back when
That's how we blend distance
This is how cats get blasted into experience
Cause nobody don't know where the bodies appearing
I spit heat serum, Beat clearing, Shots at the vermin
You weak fearin my next moves instead of watchin your stearin
I'm in my next code injectin more serum
In my heart of gold, I know they don't answer cause they fear em
I'm cancer, The weak rap that spread to the sternum
Imagine'n my mansion see the ocean in the clearing
Me I'm runnin free'r then deer in the evening
Ox got Tims like Pops, I'm tryna get paper cuts from hundred knots
Of that lime disease, Right from that U.S. mint robbery block
Got cowards like Osama got, Detroit Taliban with a thousand violent shot

[Salute]
I'm a problem with no real method to solve'n
My equation, Trials, Fucked up situations
Stay blaze'n, Now-a-days nothing amaze me
Through the fire, That's why I'm so stuck in my ways
Opposite attract, Body snatch, Sharp as an axe
Can't relax, I done seen the best apart for those acts
Stress on the brain, A hence, I think with a Dutch
On the B.C. tip nigga I don't do much
Nothin change but the Range and the time to the crime
So accustomed to beggars on the corners for dimes
Crime rate's where I'm from, Get higher then Meth
Hard to catch, Write'n bars only sorta to left
I'm so def, Niggas feel me out like brail
Heavy hittin, Mad balance, Stay on point when I spit
Release the best of both worlds of this hip hop shit nigga

[Phillie]
Uhh, Earth, Wind, And Fire, Spin like tires in grim attire
Motor City ambassador, Live as ten tigers
I body train with King Kong, Sprint against gazelles
Be in tip top sharp, Sharp as fish scales
Ring the dinner bell, For all my wolf pack niggas
Cringing they teeth at the sight of blood, Move back when we enter
It's the prism with the eagle vision, Iron apprentice
Slice so gracefully fake emcess hire a dentist
We kickin in fronts, Lay the pit in back yard
Raise spots like narcs for money crack and raw
The black Robin Hood til I'm live'n like I should
In the last coupes eatin fruits smoke'n on kush
With my seat sittin low, and my top let back
And you know I'm Mobb Deep like Return of the Mack
My Wisemen soldiers, Shaolin shoguns
Bail our border lines with signs of the slogan
Trademarks still attack, Engraved in my fitted cap
The W, Who better to bring it back, Picture that

[Illa Dayz]
Who's the illest, Last rhyme'n emcee
My hands move'n like water yeah
I don't care, How a nigga taught ya
Hot pencil burn and scorch ya
These manifest the last slaughter
Son and daughter holla thorwin quarters
Overseas beasts at the border yo, Screamin out peace
We came a long way to see the beast lay peace
Deep in my mind for protection
Inner city hill section, Respect the month for election
Shine design unexplainable, Where's the you man tame
It's enough picking time for the brain remain
Contained in the bid brings out my pain
I think it's lame leave'n the lame dreams to rain
My aim inferred dot, Got a target on lock
I blaze shots from a fresh piece without the box
Sunny glaze, Steamin like what, Sunny days
How far the money raise, Crime pays, See nother days</pre>
