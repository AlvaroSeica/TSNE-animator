Out on the porch

[Verse 1]
Let's have a mid-city fiesta with your west LA connection
Hop inside the vehicle start crossing intersections
We learning life's lessons
While we blaze this herbal essence
A man was still a child and I have so many questions
Struggled all my life to evade the misconceptions
Then find a place to live between the negatives and positives
While trying to make money slingin synonyms and homonyms
I went to pops house so I could visit moms and him
Cut to the mall copped a brand new pair of Timberlands
Then dipped down a one way trying to scoop up Double K
And chill with my people on this bright and sunny day
My nigga Spliff was sippin' Becks, I'm slappin hands with Thes
Ok the shady spot so we can circulate the stress
Mary Jane invades my brain now I can't complain
I'm sayin what else is there to do besides relax
Let the problems in your mind become ancient artifacts
Perhaps these raps can help you alleviate
The things that's got you trippin, yo watch me demonstrate
First you ignore the nonsense and clear your conscience
Let your pen touch the paper write verbs and consonants
As the words become a sentence you start to feel indifferent
The stress is out your mind you feel like the weight was lifted
Terrific I'm glad we had this time to discuss
I'm outro call me if you want to blaze one up

[Chorus]
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
I let the music take over my soul, body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you goin find
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
Just let the music take over my soul, body and mind
And kick back relax one time and you goin find

[Verse 2]
I try to keep it stress free take everyday at a time
Make sure the families in place and let the music unwind
I got men to take charge like major outlets
Ride around the country chillin in my LA express
On every street corner
The importance of having fun
Empty bottles spill tobacco don't nobody carry guns
We keep our minds on fun and let the drums do the bangin
On any given day like Mr. Cooper yo we hangin
Under the blue sky the state laced in smog
Pollute your quarter inch cables with all the sound that we brought
Can't get enough so brother pass another cold one
Feel like a dad at a ball game lampin with his son
Chuck D y'all word up we buggin overtime
From the light to the lime original star time
It's the Double Kriss one
And Camel brought the ammo
So we can shoot game like thugs on your sport channel
Take off the du-rag replace it with a thinkin cap
If you didn't know tell the bro he should have known that
We here for one thing and that's to remain
What's the name...name...name...nigga

[Chorus]
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes my pain stop
I let the music take over my soul, body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you goin find
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes my pain stop
Just let the music take over your soul, body and mind
Kick back relax one time and you goin find

[Verse 3]
Yo L.A. hit me one time make it funky
Double down on my underground sound I'm feelin lucky
For this jackpot I jack spots to fillin my crates
We lay back chillin and feelin the music relates
We on the (one) to the... two hangin' with my crew
Bullshittin while we sittin down drinkin our Sibu
And to the afternoon turns to the moonlight
Funky tracks and nickle sacks freestylin all night
Doin it right no one with tighter music make it better
My crew banging through blocks like shot from a Berretta
Snub nose to the hoes with problems I suppose
Honey you gotta understand your mans got flows
And I'm leavin you so by the time I get to Phoenix
Underground heads will fiend this musical genius
Transglobal by the books
Like Barnes with noble hooks
Armed with overlooked talented guests so God bless crooks
Who steal loops and keep this shit alive
Something for your troops to sit around and vibe by
From Camel, Double &amp; Thes to ease stress
We bout the hip hop so have fun and god bless

[Chorus]
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
I let the music take over my soul, body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you goin find
When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop
Just let the music take over my soul, body and mind
To kick back relax one time and you goin find

[Verse 4]
Pop collars to this
Wear ice to this
Drink crys to this
Yo is there somethin we missed
Pop collars to this
Wear ice to this
Drink crys to this
Is there somethin we missed?
Yeh like my two way
Throw boes and do the shoulder shake
We throwin boes up in here
Do the shoulder shake
Oh shit my two way
Oops my shoulder shake
I'm throwin bows</pre>
