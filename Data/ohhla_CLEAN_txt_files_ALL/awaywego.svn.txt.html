[Intro]
Uh huh, Yeah, Uh
It's, Sometimes it just gets like this, You know
Who's to say what's right or wrong?
Uh, Ah

[Verse 1]
He walked alone for such a time
No fulfillment in existence, Life was just a grind
So it's hard to stone and the soul's an empty shell
He said, Sevin, I pray for heaven, Why they send me hell?
But what could I say when I myself don't know the truth?
I guess the enviroment we were lyin in had stole our youth
Cause we were hurtin then and in some ways, We tortured still
Dreams depicting screams of victims we were forced to kill
And if they only knew how much this man regrets his past
But he only speaks to me in the reflective glass
Another night alone, Another horrid dream
He empties the bottle, Loads the hollow, Such a morbid scene
As he lifts his gun, I see his crying eyes
And looked a cold stare, He says a prayer, And he finally dies

[Chorus 2X]
Click, Click, Pow!
And away we go
Are you ready?

[Verse 2]
Uh, Uh, He was a soldier though, Most say his brain was loc
But, All he ever had was a blue rag and pistol smoke
And even though you know I'm clearly from the other side
Every now and then, This cali life, Our worlds collide
I respected he, Because he kept it g
He briefly spoke his men that's when he told me, He respected me
We connected and, It was sorta love
But we were bound by color lines and both were forced to hold a grudge
I used to pray for him in the blackness of the coldest nights
But if you truly reap what you sow, Then he owed his life
He popped some niggaz out, They were from the other side
The federal bureau got involved, so you know, Nowhere to hide
So, Barricaded in a hotel room, He hugged his sis
Wit a .38 to his head, And he calmly said this is quick

[Chorus] 2X

[Verse 3]
We were only kids, We weren't even teens
His parents abused him, I spent the night and heard the screams
He had this girl he deeply loved with all his heart
She was unfaithful, I watched it tear him apart
They said that he was soft, To me, The truth was plain
Lyin in his arms was all he had to soothe the pain
So he tryed to call, See if things would change
She told him he was nothin, Why should she explain?
I wondered if she knew the things she do would make him snap
If she would love him like he loved her and try to take it back
But it's too late, His tears already pourin
With blurry eyes, He pulled his father's pistol out the drawer
And while he had her full attention on the telephone
He said I love you, Put the metal to his dome
And

[Chorus] 2X</pre>
