Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I'm in the air all I want is the money and I see it so clear
Weed in my grinder, mine on a million
Taylor gang on the planes, you know we over the building
If they ask me how fly, I'm a tell ya
If you recognize game, I should be looking familiar
If they ask me how fly, I'm a tell ya
If you recognize a G, I should be lookin familiar

[Verse 1]
Party and chillin and fast livin how I'm suppose too
Not the choices given, I chose too
Leave the club with a couple of hoes who
Love to smoke trees, rolling it e-z widers
Paper maintain a low speed, now should I proceed
Come from a city where niggas ain't got a lot
But got it locked, so I be low key
Money, hoes, clothes is all a nigga knows
Don't bring enough I blow it by the O
I hit the road, cause shit is exactly how it seems
Why cat's been sleeping on me I been livin out my dream
The marijuana is loud but my surroundings are serene
I'm laughin and smoking hoping my camera catch the scene
Fresh up out the plane, flick another paper
Shorty wanna ride with me as bad as I wanna taker her
Put you in demand bitches taking flicks with the planes
And send them to their friends
Weed the grind mine on a million, and we over the building

[Chorus]
I'm in the air all I want is the money and I see it so clear
Weed in my grinder, mine on a million
Taylor gang on the planes, you know we over the building
If they ask me how fly, I'm a tell ya
If you recognize game, I should be looking familiar
If they ask me how fly, I'm a tell ya
If you recognize a G, I should be lookin familiar

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
And I'm livin like a balla Loc
I'm having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
Did we just become best friends with these hoes
On a boat well, probably so but we don't love them no
Only can cake causes my heart to palpitate darling
Clean that money keep this dirty ball revolving
No pausing, I get too high to have downtime
No matter what your watch say nigga it's my time
I hear them critics right now "all them fools make is weed songs" blah blah blah
You sound like a sucka, tune ya out
As I'm tuning up my Chevelle, this weekend I'm a pull it out
Lay some rubber down, slanging rocks everywhere, people mad as a motherfucker
But he jet connected, so they know they can't touch em
Airborn from here on, been sworn in
Fat pockets, cause I took chance even when they were slim

[Chorus]
I'm in the air all I want is the money and I see it so clear
Weed in my grinder, mine on a million
Taylor gang on the planes, you know we over the building
If they ask me how fly, I'm a tell ya
If you recognize game, I should be looking familiar
If they ask me how fly, I'm a tell ya
If you recognize a G, I should be lookin familiar</pre>
