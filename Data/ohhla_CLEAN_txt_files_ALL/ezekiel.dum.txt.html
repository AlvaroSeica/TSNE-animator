[Intro: Dungeon Masta]
What up son? Now you know how it feel
This goes out to you muthafucka
You know who the fuck you are
You thought you got away with that, didn't you?
Think I'mma let you live behind that?
You know I'mma see you...
Just gotta tell you the truth
Now you gotta look behind your back, bitch

[Dungeon Masta]
How can you put your fucking hands on me? I won't forget
My justice'll be ya penalty, wanna bet?
When I catch you-you, I won't explain what I do to you
I'll just mash you, give you pain, all in your cerebral
Last name Masta, first name Dungeon
Put a face to the name, ya'll cats bring disgrace to the game
Bring ya snake by the lane, that you self not take the blame
And I don't play, I'm tame, why you wanna smell me?
Nothing ya'll niggas can tell me, from that
I reign like blood dripping straight from the IV
You snuck me, I pluck thee, in time
When I rush through, I crush through, in time
Look holmes, I don't want to go back into my dark, unhappy place
When I'm finished with you, you'll beg for life to end
Don't look towards me, you starting, from now on
Call me 'is-he-real', rage, mister nice guy, I'm no longer pre-paid

[Chorus: Dungeon Masta]
I know your bitch ass, don't want beef
I'm gonna take you from the street
Your soul longer to me, and reach
Next time we meet, we shall hold courts
In the street, be like the first thing that you are, anymore
Don't be sad, cuz not living like a star, anymore
Don't be mad, cuz your paper don't go far, anymore
Back to walking on two feet, no more car, anymore

[Dungeon Masta]
Starving, hungry, nothing you can tell me
Lying in my trigger, no having visions of candy
With my destiny child, young half Indian, born wild
Dropping rules in the professor, like a bat, smile for me now
The pain is too deep, can't sleep on the struggle
In low poor section in Brooklyn, we stay true to the hustle
You can feel me, understand your muscle, if I'm worthy, stay out of our way
Them crazy cats in the play jungle, don't play
We squeeze off at the gangs in them AK, make you go away
Believe me homey, in ya doorway, smoke be leaving out your Timb
Mate, your arteries be leaking, as you soak off your blood
As you drip and you die, laying in your puddle of mud
Dungeon Masta not here to demonstrate, niggas wanna add
More fuel to the plate, using my hands to state fate
When you see me coming, give me my space
Before I run up on your with the riot pump and cock it back in ya face

[Chorus]

[Dungeon Masta]
Handing despiration fills my heart, you let me
Look holmes, you should of left it alone, the dirt checked you
Broke out, aimed it at ya man, I don't respect you
True blood, got to please, out to let, hang it man
If you didn't have the hammer cocked back, I be swinging it
But you had the drop on me, you should of popped me
Nothing on this planet gonna stop me, from making sure you're a dead man
Mentally it's serious, I fucked the mad dough, I want it back in blood
You owe nigga, I love this beat shit, don't give a fuck who you creep with
I know where you at, got set up by the bitch that you sleep with
Nigga, where you going ain't no secret
Everybody know the time come, your ass is mine
I won't let that shit get to me, go and ask it, now, now, now
My rap wreck, niggas worser than cancer

[Chorus]

[Outro: Dungeon Masta]
You hear that? I'm telling you, duke
And I mean that shit, every word...</pre>
