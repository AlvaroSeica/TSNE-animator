[Intro: Solomon Childs]
N.G.P., Paris Crew
You know... S. Childs

[Solomon Childs]
I'm from where dudes snitch
Be back on the block, the same day
Forever rep Henderson and Broadway
I'm from where the guns in my hood firing
From where they slap box foreign
From where the pigs don't go
From where you can't get a fair one
Every apartment, got atleast one gun
From where the average sucker, don't come
From where they mix Hypnotiq with the Hennessey
From where the extortion game move heavenly
From where a cat don't care who your family is
But got to make sure you handle your biz
But seriously, I'm from where it's a war
Fatigue jackets, car hard suits, Timberland construction boots
From where it's corrupt, but legendary like Pete Rose
Where white boy's wild like Axl Rose

[Chorus: sample (Solomon Childs)]
And Staten Island (West Brighton)
And Staten Island (New Brighton)
And Staten Island (Stapletown)
And Staten Island (Killah Hill)
And Staten Island (Port Richmond)
And Staten Island (Mariner's Harbor)
And Staten Island (Southshore)
And, and, and, and (Staten Island)

[Solomon Childs]
We right here, Mercury
From where Wu-Tang held hip hop under autopsy
From where the Force MC's defeated the Cold Crush Crew
From where cats'll turn they back on you
From where police'll put a bundle on you
I'm from where, everybody in the hood cousins
From where you get popped for fronting
From where them beef patties is stale
From where the O.G.'s still sip Ballentine Ale
From where the real killas is in jail
And got parole holds and ain't get no bail
From where the baby mothers don't send no mail
Out of sight, out of mind
From where your man's police and he'll lend you his nine
Lend you his vest, lend you his shield
Cover up the niggas you killed

[Chorus]</pre>
