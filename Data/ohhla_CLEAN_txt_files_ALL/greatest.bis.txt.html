[Verse One]
Same time you listenin' to this tape
The G-8 done already, decided our fate
Somewhere up in Scottland or Ireland, whatever
Sound like Mase and I don't mean Betha
Yeah
All hell 'bout to break loose
Whoops, too late, hop the gate they done flown the coup
The preachers say I better pray to get my sins cleared
Or end up in Hell, but shit I'm already there
Hate, murder, mutalation, molestation, devastation
Starvation, all in our nation
And that crack got 'em trapped, crazy out they head
Watchin' fiends on the streets is like watchin' Dawn Of The Dead
But these are real life zombies
While she lookin' for a fix her daughter lookin' for her mommy
And that H.I.V. murkin' niggas somethin' lethal
I ain't gotta watch Sixth Sense to see dead people

[Chorus]
The greatest trick ever performed
Wasn't by Harry Houdini, David Copperfield or Black Stone
The greatest trick ever performed
Wasn't by Willie Lynch, Adolf Hitler or Jim Jones
The greatest trick ever performed
Wasn't the election, 9/11 or the weapons of mass destruction
No, no
You wanna know what it is?
It's the devil makin' the world think he didn't exist
Yeah

[Verse Two]
If ignorance is bliss then what the fuck is this?
Children play, get blown away but bullets strayin' don't miss
Didn't know about death but it still exists
Witness they very last breath as they eye's go stiff
I pray they lord lift 'em up and God give 'em a kiss
It's better than down here, ain't got to suffer and shit
I've been broke so long I tend to forget
How it feel to buy a meal without stamps or WIC
Is it me or are these babies growin' up too quick
Just yesterday she was a baby now she got one on her hip
Tryin' hard to hang on but she's losin' her grip
And that deadbeat nigga ain't givin' her shit
Just more heartache then he up and split
Baby's eye's like his but sayin' it ain't his kid
Got her faith on the edge and she's 'bout to slip
Devil got her thinkin' God done abandoned ship

[Chorus]
The greatest trick ever performed
Wasn't by Harry Houdini, David Copperfield or Black Stone
The greatest trick ever performed
Wasn't by Willie Lynch, Adolf Hitler or Jim Jones
The greatest trick ever performed
Wasn't the election, 9/11 or the weapons of mass destruction
No, no
You wanna know what it is?
It's the devil makin' the world think he didn't exist
Yeah

[Verse Three]
I see the world apocalyptic, the truth's been encrypted
The human life scripted and from that depicted
Now that's not realistic
It's trite and quite twisted
Bad new, never good news, tune in, don't miss it
Channel 2 through 5 got a high speed chase
Same thing on 7 plus the clerk got shot in the face
Probably a robbery
Change channels, follow me
9 and 11 show the same ole' economy
Deficit, half the shit, I flip the channel quick
But 13 showin' all of that
Plus a missin' kid
That good kidnapped by a punk ass chump
Found a car in the field, guess what they found in the trunk?
I hear 'em in the wind, laughin' and callin'
Got me feelin' just like Denzel did in Fallen
Half crazy but I know the Devil's real
Shit, I should know
I signed a record deal

[Chorus]
The greatest trick ever performed
Wasn't by Harry Houdini, David Copperfield or Black Stone
The greatest trick ever performed
Wasn't by Willie Lynch, Adolf Hitler or Jim Jones
The greatest trick ever performed
Wasn't the election, 9/11 or the weapons of mass destruction
No, no
You wanna know what it is?
It's the devil makin' the world think he didn't exist
Yeah</pre>
