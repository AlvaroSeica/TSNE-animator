    "Ah-ah-ah..
     Lemme tell ya somethin..
     I don't play around with girls like that
     You know I don't really like to socialize wit 'em"

[Intro: Rubbabandz]
Enforcin the rules, we got 'em

[Chorus: Rubbabandz]
We got the Grandaddy Flow, handcuff ya ho
9th Prince, Rubbabandz, we about to blow
Keep it on a low, then it bubbles slow
All y'all haters..
We got the Grandaddy Flow, handcuff ya ho
9th Prince and Rubbabandz, we about to blow
Keep it on a low, then it bubbles slow
All y'all haters..

[9th Prince]
Eh-yo, I seen True on the corner of Decatur and Marcue Garvey
Ready to assassinate son like Lee Harvey
Heard the need for raw soup, the massive cherry Kangol
Underneath was the bulletproof suede Wu bally shoes
What I got to lose? My Grandaddy Flow's unstoppable
Shorty looked tropical like Playboy supermodels
Dust 'em slingers like gospel
Thirty stake on Jesus but I'm the sleeziest
I might look righteous but I'm the devious
A ghetto Cleopatra, only the 9th Prince can sieze this
Reach this, pass the masterpieces
I love to see my black woman, rollin with clicks
Brothers approach with weak slang, you ain't havin that shit
Every morning before I hit the strips
You hooked me up with a hot plate of fish and grits
I'm not a dog, I don't prefer Timbaland bits
I'm slick rich, hit it from the back while I'm pullin on ya hips
You're suckin ya lips
Radios and DJ's bang this in the clubs, while ya suckin on some tits
We all know some chickens are scarecrows
Rip like a vinyl, rooster flow, pigeon toe, puffin on the Optimo
Colored girls bangin out casinos, 9th Prince and Dom PaChino
I got the caramel complexion, he got the vision of a latino
Handcuff ya ho's, Grandaddy Flow, we got the Grandaddy Flow

[Chorus x0.5]

    "Because I feel like this..
     Lemme tell ya somethin..
     I don't play around with girls like that
     You know I don't really like to socialize wit 'em"

[9th Prince]
Eh-yo, we just finished fuckin for two and a half hours
I finished showin and provin I've got the manpower
Darts are sour, how many times you let me hit in the shower?
Man stubbed ya girlfriend back out on ya mother's favorite couch
I told you before, you ain't rollin wit no styles
You said you'd have my seed if I put it in your pouch
After shit really hurt, would you try to kick the 9th Prince to the dirt?
Don't let the God surf again, she's just a flirt
Like a Devil in a skirt, kick her to the curb
before she strike the brain nerve, I observed
All women are violent, includin you boo
I stand almost six feet two and unstoppable
My dick weighed about forty pounds
When I cum, it bust like the sound of a tre' pound
I represent the underground, my female's commercial
Pull up in a six-hundred convertible
I'm verb-ial, I'm verb-ial

[Chorus]
[Chorus - second half only]

    "Because I feel like this.. ah-ha-ha..
     Lemme tell ya somethin..
     I don't play around with girls like that
     You know I don't really like to socialize wit 'em" (X4)</pre>
