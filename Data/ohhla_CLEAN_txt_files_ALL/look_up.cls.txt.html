Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, I'm a real ass-trologist
Study them curves like a playboy biologist
Never keep the money up, micro economist
Blame it on my sign, I'm a Taurus till the chorus
Those Scorpios never bore us
I live on the dangerous side
Libras weighing good and evil
Gemini's couldn't decide
My Leos you can hold on to my lion's mane
Now watch me skinny dip with the Aquarius again
Awh here we go talking that bull damn right, me 11 in Cancers, I pulled over
And the Aries and the Virgos, I'm virtually compatible with any sign
Let me show Libras how to really lay it down
I straight represent, captain of the Capricorns
Gain heaven sent
Sergeant of the Sagitarius and Pisces
Lookin to the stars, knowing that I'm blessed nicely

[Chorus]
Look up and tell me what you see
I will decide my destiny
From the stars to the planets to the moons
Read the signs of astrology and let the sky speak to you
Howling at the moon, born with a lot tosay
Lookin up at the stars
Let the good times lead the way

Yeah, half man, half animal, I'm ready for departure
We connect the dots, try to figure how the stars work
I'ma Sagitarius the hard headed archer
Coming with bow and arrows to puncture your bone marrow
I'm so unusual, I'm feeling optimistic
I ain't scared to take a risk kid, I'm scared I'll miss it
Can't sit in one place, I'm restless and wreckless
Everything I'm blessed with, I stay overprotective
They say I'm superficial but I'm just misunderstood
Loyal to my brotherhood and do it like no other could
Look up to the stars I'm finally exploding
I'm not a supernova, I'm a super nova scotian

You're never gonna grow up,
According to my zodiac, there ain't a situation
That I won't adapt
Hold me back, I'm goin in
I'm just too clever and too blunt
Coming alive between November 22 and December 21, we up

[Chorus]
Look up and tell me what you see
I will decide my destiny
From the stars to the planets to the moons
Read the signs of astrology and let the sky speak to you
Howling at the moon, born with a lot to say
Lookin up at the stars
Let the good times lead the way

I'ma lead with Scorpio, sellin out the orphia
Stop taking them opiuts, hold them pills like Morpheus
Everything I say and do is prolly not appropiate
Used to get in trouble cause I had the wrong associates
I'm a little monster, you could read my horoscope
Life is kinda hard to figure out like it was morse code
Libra but I'm balanced, I'm a small demented phantom
Also, half of Scorpio I've got this temper tantrum
I remember back when I was handsome
Young and famous rich, but now I'm bucking Charlie Manson
I would keep advancing, yes I'll make it probably in time
Because I got this crazy drive from my astrology signs
I'm a little goblin, policy is no apologies
People watch me fall asleep but now I kill it flawlessly
It's absolute my vanity, maximum insanity
I'm masculine and actually back to breathing anarchy

[Chorus]
Look up and tell me what you see
I will decide my destiny
From the stars to the planets to the moons
Read the signs of astrology and let the sky speak to you
Howling at the moon, born with a lot to say
Lookin up at the stars
The good times lead the way</pre>
