Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Me &amp; my girl both highed up
In the stip club at the bar lining shots up
When this one bitch walk past us
Me &amp; her eyes touched, hers &amp; mine
In such a way I knew she was down to fuck
Yeah my girl caught me looking but she didn't spazz
In fact she even complimented on this bitch's ass
Uh, that got me thinkin like yeah
I wonder if she gonna be mad if I ask her
if I could bring this one bitch to the pad with us
Mentally envision all the fun we could have with her
Shawty licking me girl while I am smashing her in back of her
Mustered up the courage if I could actually
To get these lovely ladies wrestling in bed with me
While my girl was looking at my face the whole time
And what she spoke it seemed as though she could read my mind
She sipped her wine &amp; smiled, &amp; asked if I was down for something wild

Mama I know you thinking exactly what I'm thinking
You wanna see what she look like
Bucknaked moaning &amp; screaming
We ain't gone tell nobody
This gone be our lil secret
Me &amp; my girl gone bring a girl home we gone have a threesome
Mama I know you thinking exactly what I'm thinking
You wanna see what she look like
Bucknaked moaning &amp; screaming
We ain't gone tell nobody
This gone be our lil secret
Me &amp; my girl gone bring a girl home we gone have a threesome

Yeah needless to say I accepted the challenge
Now it's me, my girl &amp; this new bitch 3 deep in my rally spoke
Bout to swerve to the store for Trojans
cause I rather spend 450 on Jordans instead of abortions
Made it to the crib
Pull up, Hop out
my Bitch grabbed our new bitch on the ass
Hot damn, watch out
Before I walked in cut the alarm off they was on the couch
I rolled up a joint, &amp; said got damn yall gone leave me out
We proceeded to get weeded &amp; freaky all simultaneous
My girl laughing at the faces this new bitch make while taking it
Everybody happy way past satisfactory
I didn't see this coming, we was having a nice little Saturday
Never know what your girl is thinking on the low
To think when she asked me to come to the strip club I almost said no

Mama I know you thinking exactly what I'm thinking
You wanna see what she look like
Bucknaked moaning &amp; screaming
We ain't gone tell nobody
This gone be our lil secret
Me &amp; my girl gone bring a girl home we gone have a threesome
Mama I know you thinking exactly what I'm thinking
You wanna see what she look like
Bucknaked moaning &amp; screaming
We ain't gone tell nobody
This gone be our lil secret
Me &amp; my girl gone bring a girl home we gone have a threesome</pre>
