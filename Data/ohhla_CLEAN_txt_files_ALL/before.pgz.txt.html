[Verse 1 - Drapht]
Define me like a lion defines a whole jungle
Definition of street and humble
Like Bruce Lee in Rumble in the Bronx
Summoned to the tops like we just stumbled across
Rapunzel's locks ahh, whatever Barney Gumble gots
I want it, Plutonic blaze, hitting harder than bubonic
Plague a convict, confiscate
Record to take the weight off like Fonda's tapes
Everyone's like Charlie Chapplin
And Tom Cruise is acting like Michael Jackson
It's crazy, maybe the global warming
Or maybe, just the famous are falling
Call me Pauly Polter, roll in a six
White like a polar bear stare a solar eclipse
Kick the goal like kids switch kick flipping the rock and roll
On top of the bowl, that's control

[Hook - All]
It's Obese, here to leave impressions
Beathedz, bring the heat relentless
Crooked eye, bout to speak the essence
"I came too far not to be respected"

[Verse 2 - Illy]
Before I leave, I'm setting benchmarks each release
Rock, debut drop retiree and every disc between
And I'm a be seen with at least one Veronica sitting on a beach
Sipping something sweet, somewhere in the tropics
Fat wallet in my deep pockets
For now I got no cash, no smash hit
Just dash and tip the next shit, no slash, no Asterix
When the champagne bottles pop, victory cigars lit
I'll leave my classics and an arse to kiss
You believe the cheek of this kid?
Believing nobody out equal this except a few at the top
Before he hit the door, I thought I'd drop a send off fit for a boss
I'm on a track with Pegz, so that's one less task left
On my list to address, before I leave

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Patto]
Before I leave, I want a house with no lease
And bed down with a fatter momma than obese
Drunk in the streets, running a muck
Junk hanging out the front like a Peking duck
Pump mad weights, get large as hell
So I can hang around with pussy like Gargamle
From getting blow once a year like a birthday candle
To getting more chicks than Heffner can handle
Moved from Coburg to Coburg North
From a bedroom house, to a house with a porch
Get mad rich, make a smash hit song
And be the first in the charts that won't feature Akon
Go triple plat with best rap tune
Collect my award in an Adidas bapsuit
It it's all bad and my plan turns shitty
At least they can say that he rocked burn city

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Pegz]
Yeah
I thought I knew the difference, between the music business
And gay rappers break dancing on Euro Vision
But who will listen to somebody with a shoe addiction?
Living with their mums, talking about their crew is pimping
Spinal tap with laptops and final scratch
This is for my real DJ's bringing the vinyl back
On a diamond back, with a biker's patch
20 inch biceps, covered in tribal tats
Chasing hits like a junkie hoe
One dole day, walking down Studley Road
Got a beautiful mind and a heart of gold
But you don't want to push me around like Russell Crowe
Not a role model, Godfather that's not me
If I touch a few souls that's extraordinary
But all I want is respect, before I leave
Paying homage to the New York streets
Come on
