[Krizz Kaliko]
Pull up in a Â‘96 Whoopty Whammy
816 Boyz got that grammy
My baby momma's momma told me she can't stand me
Rollin up with hella BOOM screamin' like a banshee
Get that Arab money
That ABU DHABI
Keep a hand on in case they try to rob me
Tryin' to get that paper
Tryin' to cop that money
Drivin' my scrapper around like
A BUGATTI

ABU DHABI is good but too much
We keepin' everything hood that we touch
I like it
I love it
I want some more of it I say
Don't know ABU DHABI
You gon' learn today!

Okay!
Look out!
I'm on my ABU DHABI
I'm like UH YES!
ABU DHABI
All night and all day!
Is all good!
Is all ABU DHABI

[Kutt]
My life is all ABU DHABI
Are we oh, we can't be baby
they be hatin' lately maybe
cause I made a crazy statement
When I bought the black on black
In the range I be rollin'
New crocodile skin thangs on my soles when
I be slidin' through the function like a Spike Lee movie
On my Kansas City Ice Tea Movie
Like excuse me
You must be from Ireland
Cause every time I see you my penis is Dublin, Dublin

MVP? Check nigga
2 years in a row? Check nigga
A Wayne verse? Check....well?
Yeah Techs got it
My nigga!
Abu Dhabi I'm good
All I need is a check nigga
Money, family, loyalty
Most of all is respect nigga
Got it

Look out!
I'm on my ABU DHABI
I'm like UH YES!
ABU DHABI
All night and all day!
Is all good!
Is all ABU DHABI

PAUSE
Check twitter it's trendin
Real DJs go ahead and start spinnin'
I know it's the fifth time everyone has requested
But don't be a bitch like the Grinch who stole Christmas
ABU DHABI it means it's all good
Wishin' ABU DHABI is like wishin' a nigga would
I cant be ABU DHABI means I can't be touched
If you got me ABU DHABI you got me fucked up
Whoop Whoop! Whoop Whoop! Whoop Whoop! For the family!
Sha shake sha shake shake ya ass hottie
Wanna see ya hands up in the party
Now that, now that's Abu Dhabi.

Look out!

All night and all day!
Is all good!
Is all ABU DHABI
