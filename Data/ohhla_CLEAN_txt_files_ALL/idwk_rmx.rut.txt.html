[Intro: Apocalipps]
Ruthless Bastardz, remix
Heard you was creepin' shorty
I got some shit I wanna say to you

[Apocalipps]
Yo, I don't wanna know if money got his jump off in you
Bitch you lucky I ain't let the fuckin' pump off in you
Creepin' with that lame, come on, you know he corny
Whipped his ass out, then he called police on me
Couldn't believe that shit, when you jumped out of his whip
Four in the morning, I should of sent some shots through that shit
But umm, I'm kinda glad I ain't let my gun off
I decided that you ain't worth the pain, now you done off
You lie too much, that's why you always be losing
And you don't want Truck get parked in the front, keep it moving
Take a good look, cuz you'll never see Lipps
I gave you the last pitch, and you swung and you missed
And everything is paid for, from the crib to the phone
And I paid for them titties, get your own, get your own, nigga
I don't even want the bitch no more, you can have her
Aiyo, Mario, holla at 'em

[Mario Winans]
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I will never ask you
I just kept it to myself

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't want to know, oooh, baby

[Bless]
Huh, she ain't gonna do that to me and get away with it (not this one)
Yo, ma, what's in the dark, or come to the light
And you ain't acting right, plus, I know you by heart
Be easy, and I heard you slid off with Weezy
Believe me, if I wanted to, I could of did you greasy
I talked to my man, he told me, chill and be patient
Our feelings ain't a game, this ain't no PlayStation
Three strikes and you out, that's how the lord do it
I play myself cuz that lame ass story, I should of saw through it

[Iron Mic]
Shit, girl I don't wanna know, cuz I don't even care
I ain't blind, I can see you ain't playing fair
I ain't no angel, I ain't gon' trip
Play myself, try to flip, I know I ain't shit
But I am Ruthless, ma, that probably won't change
Not for no bird, but for wifey, I'm popping my thing
I remember you started acting strange, I packed my shit and left
Told you I wasn't coming back again, I came back like I always do
I couldn't imagine another nigga making love to you
Make me wanna let off a slug or two, but I don't even wanna know
Keep it on the low, let's go, Mario

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
