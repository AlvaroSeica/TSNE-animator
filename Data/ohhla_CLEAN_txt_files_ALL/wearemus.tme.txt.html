(People tell me I don't know what hip hop is
I know... that's the problem)

It's dickriding, bullshit, patronizers, and politics
It's potheads, fake revolutionaries and alcoholic kids
It's a disgruntled religion
Goals with tunnel vision
Its bitches, shitheads, motherfuckers and assholes
It's a big mess confusing stress, it's a hassle
Its ten thousand ego maniacs with insecure swords
Drawn in front of a Jimmy Hoffa castle
Its spray cans, box cars toys with paint and gay bands
It's homophobic macho guys
Media zombies
Material worshipers and gestapo spies
It's a black art filled with white posers
It's internationally known with unbiased brown nosers
It's fun, it's my life, it's most people's hobby
It's an excuse to be snobby, its choppy crossfaders and rusty needles
It's free expression inspired by Neil Young, Frank Zappa and the Beatles
It's performing at empty shows with nobody there
It's putting your last drop of energy into a song and having nobody care
It's frustration, hate, negativity, depression and envy
Man it's fucken music and it's in me

(AwareNess)
I know that, you think that, hip hop's a name
I know that, you think that, it's all the same
Live once and die twice and you become the game
