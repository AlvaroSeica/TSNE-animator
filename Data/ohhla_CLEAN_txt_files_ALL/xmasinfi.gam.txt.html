[Intro: Danny Pudi as Abed]
What if you were a Jehovah's Witness
that was merely pretending to be into Christmas
Gathering clues and blending in
to take down the holidays from within?

[Donald Glover as Troy]
You mean like a spy, investigating?
Making it seem like I'm celebrating?
When actually I'm infiltrating
Santa's operation? (YOIP!)

[Donald Glover a/k/a Childish Gambino]
Going deep cover past enemy lines
Makin everybody think I'm on the Christmas side
Rockin warm sweaters, hangin big ass lights
If the fat man could see me yo it's gotta look right
I'll watch all the TV specials that I never could
I'll even cry during the sad ones like James Bond would
And when the big night comes, it's time to set the bait
Cold milk, hot cookies, decorative plates~!
And he'll come down the chimney and then it'll be just him and me
But he won't know we're enemies, cause I'll play sincere
Spring a trap, like that, hug him tight, get on his lap
And tell him he can come back every year
Cause I am Jehovah's most Secret witness
So I might have to dedicate my life to Christmas
And act just like I love it 'til the day I die

[Danny Pudi a/k/a Abed]
A-B-E-D~! Connoisseur of Christmas
All of the spectrum? None of your business
Thoughts too fast to comprehend
Just wanna do right, by my friend
If years were seasons, this December
would be the December of our December
More blueprints than Howard Hughes
But if there are blueprints, how do we choose?
We have to be happy to get to the end
We have to save Christmas to save our friends
We have to save Christmas to save our friends
We have to save Christmas to save our friends!
{Hey guys! Rapping?} Yep! Wanna join us? {TOTALLY!}</pre>
