(Kangol Slim)
Well my friends, the time has come,
To pump the party and have some fun,
P-Poppers, there's work to be done,
Let's let the music play on,
Everybody sing, everybody dance,
Throw up your hands in wild romance

Chorus (Kangol Slim):

We going to the third Ward, to Melphinine, 
to Josephine, to Seventeen, We going all over,
We're going to, Calliope, the Seventh Ward, 
the Sixth Ward, to St. Bernard, We're going all over

(Kangol Slim):
Hey DJ play that beat,
I came to see the girls shake it all up in the street,
Get the trigger and the rounds, throw'em on the turntables,
Get ready to mix it up, while the *screaming noise* turns the fade up,
DJ, second line, yeah you know how it go,
Can't resist that P-N-C and make 'em all hit the floor,
South Coast, Drama Squad, Prime Time fa sho,
Haters better get out the way, we bout to kick down the door,
It goes,
One for the triggerman beat,
Two times for the group P-N-C,
Three times for my DJ Fullpack,
Break it down, mix it down, vibe on another track

Bridge One (Kangol Slim):
Why can't you understand that I don't want to be your man?
It was just a one night thing, or should I call it a one night fling?
Ol' girl you need to let it go, why am I pagin' you?  Put hoe,
Everytime I do a show, you be in the front row,
Stop stalkin' me, hoe let go,
Why you playin' these games?
I thought you was on a level mane,
Look like your level is low,
I'm lookin' for a high level hoe,
Where she at?  In the Mac, Melph, or 'lio?
Gert-Town, Pigeon-Town, or Holly Grove?
Where ever she at let me know,
Cuz I'm sure gone go

Chorus

(Kangol Slim):
Shake it up, tear it down, wash that floor,
Here comes the Hot girls out that 'lio,
Shake that, twerk that, just like I told ya,
Here comes the pepper girls out the Magnolia,
Shake that, tear it down, oh my Lord,
Here comes the pepper girls out the Seventh Ward,
Shake that, twerk that, oh my Lord,
Here comes them Hot Girls out the ninth Ward,
Now this is just how it goes in my city,
Ask anybody in any place if P-N-C be comin' with it,
&gt;From the old school to new school, new school,
Old school you know we still a fool,
Been in this game for many years,
P-N-C name ringin' off the heezee,
I remember me and Meanor used to rock the big Easy,
But we done came up, got our DJ's on the tables,
Was bout to tear it up,
Fullpack, P-N-C droppin' that hot stuff,
We like to see you girls hit the street and straight tear it up,
Came from makin' pennies up to makin' a hot buck,
And best believe we here to stay,
P-N-C done paved the way for a lot of rappers today,
Been makin' hits and it's a very fact,
And all we waitin' on is gold and platinum plaques,
You can believe that,
It's P-N-C makin' the hits for you fa sho,
And if you didn't know I know a place where we all could go

Chorus

Bridge Two (Misdemeanor):
Whoa, this P-N-C comin' at you straight representin',
New Orleans,
I got my DJ on the table,
And they all go by the name of the mighty Fullpack,
As we proceed to bring it to you on the turntables,
He came on the track cuz he said he had somethin' to tell you,
What you got to tell 'em Fess?
*Turntable scratching to say "I got skills"*

(Turntable scratches by Big Fess for 30 seconds)

Bridge Three (Kangol Slim):
Well my friends, the time has come,
To pump the party and have some fun,
P-Poppers, there's work to be done,
Let's let the music play on,
Everybody sing, everybody dance,
Throw up your hands in wild romance
