[Apocalipps]
Aiyo, attention muthafuckas all eyes on me
Apocalipps, you look close, the four-five's on me
Whoever come up on the v, ya'll better have that stuff
Come with loon, and not that cat that rap with Puff
Pardon me, dred, many missiles spark up your dreads
And if I miss shots'll make a uey and park in your head
I bark on the feds, scream on the cops, shit on the judge
Let him know right then and there that I ain't shit without drugs
Ship me to jail, first chance, shit out my rug
I press cats who warrant visits, make 'em give me my drugs
Shit in my palms, sweat on my face, bone in my mouth
Flipping pies in New York, I caught a zone in the south

[Chorus: Iron Mic (Apocalipps)]
Let's go, Apocalipps, niggas learn
Megatron got it locked, when will they learn?
We mixtape monsters, man, them slugs'll burn
We got the streets on smash, that's what we earned
Now Lipps tell 'em how we do, when he come through fronting
Be in the hood with his ice out, them cats be stunting
Yeah, yeah, right at the boy, he resist we dump him
Let 'em down, be out the next day MG up, that's right
What to do now? (Go get the tech)

[Apocalipps]
These fucking clowns wanna see me under, with your rated PG raps
I'm a fuckin' mixtape monster
I jet with your wife, homey, I can better her nights
When she found out that I eat pussy better than dykes
But I'm better with pipe, especially when my cheddar is right
Cuz I can fuck her like Don King, then get her to fight
But the pleasure is life, infered berettas is nice
I want it all, and I'm willing to pay whatever the price
Aqua blue leather with a pair of brand new Nike's
With the aqua blue checks, and if you stare, you lights
The mack is so trife, that's why I fall back and get right
And if you rob me, my shine got a tracking device
So I can snatch ya fucking neck off, still attached to my ice
And maybe next time you're stupid ass'll practice a heist
It be the shark in the rapper, that'll get him to bite
The competitor's right, I bag your moms instead of your wife
I got a mob in Staten Island, that'll hit 'em up right
And double pump shotgun slugs'll shred 'em up twice
Coroners'll dress 'em up nice, me, I'mma be stepping on bikes
And ride on niggas for the rest of my life, you likes?</pre>
