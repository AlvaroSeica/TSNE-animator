Verse One: {Tec-9}

Still got a lot of dog bitches on my list
Who be fuckin' for office and under cover suckin' dicks
I rapped about 'em back in my first rhyme
I'm a kick it once again because they still on my mind
I'm kickin' it on them hoes them dog ass hoes
I'm kickin' kickin' kickin' on them dog ass hoes
Well I guess I got to start with this bitch named Nell
A dick suckin' cross thrower sent straight from hell
Never liked her just fucked her
Claimed that I stuck her the cable man
Was puttin' in time so it ain't mine 
A lot of bitches was waitin' on my name 
It ain't no thang because I'm gonna let me nuts hang
Next up is my baby mama a fuckin' hood rat
Didn't use a rubber when I hit the cat
She love to just shake shake ride the dick
Now I wish I never meet her because she make me sick
But it ain't no thang cuz I'm gonna let me nuts hang
But ain't no thang because I'm gonna let my nuts hang

Chorus:

Just go ahead baby 
Shake shake it baby
Twerk twerk that ass if you can't be faded
Go ahead baby 
Shake shake it baby
Twerk twerk that ass if you can't be faded

Verse Two: {Lil' Ya}

Let me tell you about this hoe that
I almost forgot cuz she sucked a 
Player's wood for some gap socks
Her name was Michelle she was Sabrina friend
Got her loaded hit that ass of the straight gin
She was down to fuck wasn't havin' a drain
So I tricked her get out and left that hoe in pain
Now here's another bitch that I forgot about
Like a preener player I had to get them out
Her name was Black and she was a fine bitch
Stole my watch out my house sucked a nigga dick
Still in high school with a gap in her teeth 
Got to give it to you Black you could
Beat a nigga meat oops almost forgot bout one more
Demetrice I fucked behind a liquor store
It was one Newton night I was headed to the tail
But fuck that shit she didn't have no bail
Made her walk from the liquor store and jumped in my ride
This stank hoe begged just to sit inside
I can't think of no more Yella Boy
You know you not a trick
So won't ya talk some more shit bout another bitch

Chorus: {3x}

Verse Three: {Yella Boy}

I like to watch a p popper 
Twist, shake, dance do it
If you got a big booty let me see ya shake it do it
Wait a minute what about Teesha
She was a real dick pleaser 
I tossed that hoe one night for a Chucky Cheese pizza
She was nasty like to fuck twenty four seven she's in the mood
And when I'm curious now she seem like Ebaneaser Scrooge
Shakin' it twerk it all around if you from the N. O.  town
Fresh got 'em twerkin' to that CaÂ§h Money sound
This is for them hoes who like to throw that sloppy pussy
Like my nigga Nolia said "shakin' washin' washin' pussy"
Now I'm a wrap it up with Kelly because
She's down with hittin' the telle
Bitch tried to fuckin' ride me I was 
Diggin' in her belly if you bout it scream and shout it
Let me see ya bounce it pop it why bitch
Because I'm from the third I got the nerve
Ready to serve 

Chorus: {3x}</pre>
