Now if my memory's correct, then I'm a take you back 
on a trip through the past but its more than that 
as we break it down to ya from beginning to end 
Long Beach is the city where it all begins (Eastside) 
started out flowin for the homeys all the time 
cuz the click I was with was over kickin gangsta rhymes 
they were tight and we were tapin em 
So yo Dubb (what up) 
won't you tell em where you takin em 

[T-Dubb] 
Now lets take a trip down memory lane 
when things first started but its not the same 
when life with the Dubb in a way was kinda hopeless 
sipped out with the crew now its all in focus 
layin back kickin dope rhymes with my kin 
Glaze, M&amp;M, Dubb, and Twin 
growin up from neighborhood kids on the block 
damn, who'd a eva thought 

(Chorus) 
Who would've eva thought, we would still be down 
with this laid back love, and this old G sound 
its so good, so goooooood, its so good, so goooooood 

[DJ Glaze] 
Can you relate to what I'm sayin as the struggle begins 
when ya livin life low and you short on ends 
when ya dreams look like they neva come true 
and your homeys never seem to come through 
but they say it ain't right without a struggle I guess 
so I sip the Tanquerey to keep my mind off the stress 
they wouldn't even listen to the sound 
so M&amp;M would you please explain how it went down 

[M&amp;M] 
Now I can take you back in the days from giddy up (yeah) 
ends was kinda low so the homeys did me up 
tight like phat, we were down you couldn't fade us 
even though things wouldn't turn out in our favor (hell nah) 
and I remember them days, I thought the group would split 
people clowned us, doubt us, but we still didn't quit 
and through the years we've been through a lot 
damn, who'd a eva though 

(Chorus) 
Who would've eva thought, we would still be down 
with this laid back love, and this old G sound 
its so good, so goooooood, its so good, so goooooood 

[DJ Glaze] 
Well now its 96 and I'm loungin wit tha homeys (what) 
NBA Jam on the fifty inch Sony 
plushed out krib wit the Benz in the driveway 
chillin on the hills of Pacific Coast Highway (right) 
ballin, outta control, with my peeps 
got brand new kicks for every day of the week 
damn I hear somebody subbin (who is it) 
in a Lexus 400 its the homey T-Dubb 

[T-Dubb] 
Now they call me big daddy Dubb with a beat in the trunk 
so I crack a brew and smoke a Philly blunt 
with the diamond in the back and a sun roof top 
diggin in the scene with the flossy lean 
got my papes and its great that we finally made it 
cuz we stayed sucka free, so you know you can't fade it 
blowin up the industry to make or not 
now, who'd a eva thought 

(Chorus) x2 
Who would've eva thought, we would still be down 
with this laid back love, and this old G sound 
its so good, so goooooood, its so good, so goooooood </pre>
