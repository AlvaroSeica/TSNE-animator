[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And OHHHHHHHHHHH
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And OHHHHHHHHHHH
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And OHHHHHHHHHHH
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour
Bigger, better, stronger, power

[Interlude: will.i.am and Bieber]
I got that power
I got that power
I got that power, power
Power, power

[will.i.am]
They call me will.i
Stay so cool, I'm chil-lin
I done made that milli
On my way to that billi
Used to have a piggy bank
but now I got that bigger bank
Who-who cares what the haters thank?
They hate cause I'm only doin what they cain't
I stay on that hustle
I flex that little muscle
Hate to bust yo' bubble
I'm on that other level
I'mma take it higher
and hi-hig-higher
I stay in fly attire
Keep burnin like that fire

[Chorus + Interlude]

[will.i.am]
Y-Y-Y-Yes y'all
Feelin funky fresh, y'all
Work to be the best y'all
Work good under pressure
Been thru all that stress, y'all
Get-Get this off my chest y'all
Made it out them projects
with this project, that's pro-gress y'all
I did it for my momma
I told her when I was younger
that I'mma be that number
one, yep I'll be that number one
I take it higher
and hi-hig-higher
I stay in fly attire
Keep burnin like that fire

[Bridge: will.i.am]
...Whatever doesn't kill you
Only makes you stronger, so I'mma get stronger
Call me like a batter ram, batter ram
I'm knockin knockin down a door again, door again
Ca-Call me like a batter ram, batter ram
I'm knockin knockin down a door again, door again

[Chorus + Interlude]

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour
Bigger, better, stronger, power
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour
Bigger, better, stronger, power</pre>
