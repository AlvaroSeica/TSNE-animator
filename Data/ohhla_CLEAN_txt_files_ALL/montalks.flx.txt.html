[Intro: Funkmaster Flex] (Araab Muzik sample) (*Fabolous)
FUNK FLEX!!! FAB!!!! (You're now listening to Araab Muzik!)
SHAYA WHATTUP?! (*I ain't even gotta say much you know!)
(*It's the money!) GRRRRRR!!!! HUH! GRRRRRR!!!!!

[Verse One: Fabolous]
Familiar with pain but wanna know joy
Money talk so you gotta raise yo' voice
Takin pictures in my latest gold row boy
My Juelz on Cam, +Oh Boy+ 
Undisputed swag champ, flow Floyd
No L's, ridin in that Rolls Royce
Or that Martin with shorty screamin "You Go Boy!"
Smokin loud while killers rollin up more noise
You niggas playin with it but it's no toy
I'm here to milk the game not go soy
Can't give these choosy bitches no choice (WORD!)
Can't give these loser niggas no voice! 
Only let the winners speak
Money talks better make it count when you speak
And how that broke man 'gon talk when
I'm ridin like this, and he Antoine Walkin
Takin care of hoes was they bad ain't the question 
Sometimes all bad bitches are even badder investments
Thirsty ass nigga you should've had a refreshment
You moved her out to Cali, though you had you a Fresh Prince (NICE!!!)
Now go and grab me some breath mints
Eh! I be talkin that shit!!!!
Have yo' bitch hold me at the crib
Got a section in the bottles when she walk in that bitch
And keep walkin in bitch, you and your cheap leggings
I'm the one with the change you can keep beggin
With yo' bum ass, should've changed her
Could've had a lil' somethin in yo' change cup

[Chorus: Fabolous]
Money talkin over here we ain't trippin, money talkin over here we ain't trippin
Money talkin over here we ain't trippin, I swear we ain't trippin, I promise we ain't trippin
Money talkin over here we ain't trippin, money talkin over here we ain't trippin
Money talkin over here we ain't trippin, I swear we ain't trippin, I promise we ain't trippin

[Outro: Fabolous]
I got one, I got two, I got three, you and me
Money talkin over here we ain't trippin, money talkin over here we ain't trippin
Throwin ones in the air like it's singles, chuckin deuces up and all the shots are doubles
Hittin threes we just ballin we ain't trippin
I swear we ain't trippin, I promise we ain't trippin
Yeah!
