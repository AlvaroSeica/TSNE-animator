[Chorus]
I live and die for what I believe in
Represent the truth of God's Word every season
Since I'm the reason for His bleedin'
Now I represent Him 'til the day I stop breathin'

[The Ambassador]
There's a war, and I can tell you straight from the door that it's raw
Not for the weak it's for the hardcore
Rugged soldier, this rugged brother told ya, "I love Jehovah"
I love like women love Montel and Oprah
We're getting' close to the rapture Maranatha
Coming soon is the Master try and capture
The idea, the incarnate God coming right here
Christ, yea, rulin' planet earth in His white gear
I hear you say He's not, trying to take away this hope we've got
But we're not shook so we drop jams, we're out to show He's got
The ability to save like coupons at the grocery spot
Defend the faith are you with it, my crews with it
Christ died, love had everything to do with it
Before Christ we loved secular life but now we're through with it
We don't fool with it, if Jesus Christ aunt down we isn't cool with it
Who is it that wants to hustle, tussle, flex muscle
Defend the Christian faith and the text plus you'll
Do some Jesus advertising, join the theocratic side and
We'll see the Son risin'

[Chorus]

[The Ambassador]
Will the real Jesus please stand up, wait there's eight of them
Nine of them, a whole line of them, there's all kinds of them
Is it the one with dreds or the blond head
The one with blue eyes or the one hangin' between those two guys
Or the one that they say is just a prophet
He nothing special, He's just the one before Mohammed
Or the archangel or the man healing on T.V
Or the other cat that's leading masses up to D.C
Or is He the eternal God of all creation, Lord of all the nations
The Sovereign, even the boss of Satan
The one making the world spin, keeping high winds twirling'
While He's getting' it on in the world wind
He made the sheep that made the fur for your shirlin'
Even made the oyster that made your pearls and
Matter of fact He made your boy, or, your girlfriend
Strong enough to put Jupiter on a bar and start curlin'
This one seems to be fittin' the true description
Of the one that gets in, fits in hearts and then convicts them
You should pick Him, because He conquered crucifixion
He took a lickin' but I tell you He kept on tickin'

[Chorus]

[The Ambassador]
I continue to preach Christ earth is my venue
Like McDonald's fries, He's the best thing on the menu
When you defend Christ it could be hazardous
But if you die you're going to live again like Lazarus
Plus add to this the reward of bringing fabulous
Truths that transform cause the Lord be changing characters
Let's get equipped to represent Him in an industry
Where they preach a different Christ and reject the trinity
And when they see us loving while they're all hatin'
And when they hear us call God while they call Satan
They'll say the people of God be getting busy like a phone with no call waitin'
The falls breakin'
Men's backs as the ax cuts the access to the King's palace
And that's just utter blackness, in fact, sin puts heads to bed like a
mattress
