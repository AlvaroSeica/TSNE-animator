[Intro: Kryme Life]
Uh, Kryme Life, nigga, yeah
T.M.F. to death, yeah, New York shit
Nahmean, yeah, same top of the what?
Of course we back... so... Kryme Life, yo

[Kryme Life]
Hit you with them things, from point blank range
And I won't miss, make niggas feel the pain
We gorillas in the myst, wanna go against the grain
Rip 'em from limb to limb, stick you from jewels to Timbs
Yo, this Kryme Life I live it, every sentence, we spitting
Fake niggas can't relate, make no mistakes
Who's the realest, uh, The Most Feared, it's about to get pretty hot
Lock and load, control city blocks
Claiming you making moves (fools) but you really not
You perpertrating fraud, no escaping the war
Coming for all ya'll, on top, taking you off
Scrape you off, something proper, it can go down
If it gotta, fuck them niggas who killed Big Poppa
(Love you Big), show stoppa, the sickest niggas in town
Don't see doctors, spread the virus around
Break beats, music to my ears, loving the sounds
See Kryme in the streets, he be making his rounds
Grap you up by the news, then I'm taking you down
On or off fields, spin on or off reel
Fuck throwing up the shield, I hit you from your waist to your heels
Just to let you know shit's real

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
You got your face screwed up, like you can't get touched
Come on, we will pop you
We lost enough niggas, taking yours, mean nothing to us
Let's go, we will pop you
You see my face? Take another look, you see my waist
Aiyo, we will pop you
I'm telling you kid, we out here handling biz
Understand, we ain't playing with this, we gotta live

[Kryme Life]
Yo, it's the profound, King Beef killa grounds
Spin around, send ya hood into ghost town
Stapleton, yeah, that's Ghost town
The Kryme coming next in line, for mine, I'mma throw down
And I ain't coming to compete with niggas, but whatever
See ya era, I'm deleting niggas, the ball snap
I'm like Sapp, on the defense, nigga
Coming at cha, you know what that mean, I'mma sack ya
Black bag ya, let the morgue freeze tag ya
No more dry snitching on wax, weak rappers
Is too comfortable and relaxed, talk shit
That's extra hard, but when they walk strips, hire extra guards
T.M.F. in this bitch, peep the repertoire
Toss more fire, torch niggas with lesser bars
Livewires, we love going against the odd
When it transpire, of course, niggas bet to dodge
If they know what's good for 'em, but he can't hide
Got eyes, all over the hood for 'em
Yeah, my street team, back in effect
Styling on these record exec's
Now my music got 'em cutting the check

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
