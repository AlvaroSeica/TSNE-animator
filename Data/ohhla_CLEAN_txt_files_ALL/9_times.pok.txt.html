Oooh Ooooh, (Block Brawlers)
Nine times out of ten, can I see you again girl
Ooh-ooh Papa Reu, (yeah)
 
[Papa Reu]
Nine times out of ten - 7x
Cause she love the way I beat it up, yeah
 
[Big Pokey]
Nine times out of ten, she be calling my phone
Playing strip dominoes, while she down the Patron
It's the Hardest Pit homegirl, dog in the zone
Hitting corners with my short stack, dogging the chrome
Nine times out of ten, she at home with me
Feeling mad, when she can't be alone with me
Nine times out of ten, she gon' tell me she love me
Always let her know, that I'm freshing her dougie
I love it when she mugging, when we bumping and grinding
Biting her bottom lip, let me know that I'm shining
I handle her real gentle, like I'm holding a diamond
And she do what I say like Simon, real talk
 
[Hook]
Nine times out of ten, she gon' call my phone
Nine times out of ten, we be all alone
Nine times out of ten, it is what it is
Nine times out of ten, baby know the deal
Nine times out of ten, she be looking good
Nine times out of ten, it be understood
Nine times out of ten, She ain't going nowhere
Cause she love the way I beat it up, yeah
 
[Big Pokey]
I know she feeling me, and I stay on her mind
When them other cats flirting, she don't pay em no mind
Baby know she fine, and she fat in the ass
Independent chick, baby stack that cash
Tight fitting jeans, with the six inch heels
Got her jumping like a truck, 26 inch wheels
She pay her own bills, she ain't digging for gold
She col' like Keish', a cold little piece
Crock bull or beast, she love that swagger
I cut her a few times, mayn she love that chatter
She make a nigga scatter, cause the loving is good
Gangsta with it mayn, the loving is hood naw I mean
 
[Hook]
 
[Papa Reu]
It's a sha-a-ame girl
The way you play around, with my heart
It's a sha-a-ame girl
The way you got me, yeeah
It's a sha-a-ame girl
The way you play around, with my heart
It's a sha-a-ame girl
The way you got me, yeeah
 
[Big Pokey]
Say short stack, I been looking for you
Nine times out of ten, it's gon' do what it do
Yeah it's true you my boo, and you cute in the face
Baby got taste, wardrobe laced
Nine times out of ten, she gon' stay on her note
That's why I take her on trips, and let her play on the boat
Winter time, I'ma have her dragging a coat
And rocking whatever bag, that she wanna tote
Baby that's the benefits, of keeping it real
You dealing with a real nigga, the kid got ill scrilla
It ain't bout that, she just want me to chill with her
So I'ma chill with her, and that's for real nigga
 
[Hook]
