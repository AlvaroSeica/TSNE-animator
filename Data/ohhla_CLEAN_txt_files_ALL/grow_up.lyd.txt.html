Album:  Sticks &amp; Stones 
Song:   Grow Up 
Typed by: E-Squared 817

Chorus: 
We ain't ever gonna grow up 
We just wanna get down 
Tell the DJ turn it up real loud 
No we'll never grow up 
And if we had our way 
We would do this every day 

I got a flow that'll make you drop 
I got a flow that'll make you pop 
I got a flow that'll make your mother and your father call the cops 
We're gonna make this thing go blow, we're gonna system overload. 
We're gonna be the generation that makes everything explode! 

And I when I say explode I don't mean that we using bombs 
We doing stuff that we don't ever have to tell our moms 
Love the stuff we got it, 
We got it all up in the room 
Paper chasing, yeah we got it everything we want 

Somehow, some way 
We're gonna have it our way 
We don't give a what, what you say 
No we don't 

Chorus: 
We ain't ever gonna grow up 
We just wanna get down 
Tell the DJ turn it up real loud 
No we'll never grow up 
And if we had our way 
We would do this every day 

We ain't ever gonna grow up 
We just wanna get down 
Show everybody who runs this town 
No we'll never grow up 
And if we had our way 
We would do this every day 

Do ya, do ya, do ya know what I mean 
I'm a princess, I don't wanna be the queen 
Please don't say, I think Mr Bean 
Every time you're talking, it makes me wanna scream 

I don't know what you heard 'bout me 
Don't remember holding out my pinkie 
I'm gonna finish off these MCs 
Like they were my cup of tea 

I got a flow that'll make you drop 
I got a flow that'll make you pop 
I got a flow that'll make your mother and your father call the cops 

Somehow, some way 
We're gonna have it our way 
We don't give a what, what you say 
No we don't 

Chorus: 
We ain't ever gonna grow up 
We just wanna get down 
Tell the DJ turn it up real loud 
No we'll never grow up 
And if we had our way 
We would do this every day 

We ain't ever gonna grow up 
We just wanna get down 
Show everybody who runs this town 
No we'll never grow up 
And if we had our way 
We would do this every day

[Busta Rhymes]
Bulls eye again 
I got 'em in a target 
Put 'em in a pocket 
Put 'em on a market 
That's the way we did 
You can see the way 
I walk and I talk 
Every time I show her what I got 
I'm sprung, I don't want to grow up 
Forever young 
Why I don't ever wanna leave you 
Better believe me, trust me 
She is the one 
Gonna make all the people 
Got up in the hard papers 
Wanna hear it that 
Are we gonna dump like this 
Leaning bend the body on the run 
And then they gotta turn and twist 
I guess it's time for pictures in my closet 
I can do this to the infinity 

Chorus: 
We ain't ever gonna grow up 
We just wanna get down 
Tell the DJ turn it up real loud 
No we'll never grow up 
And if we had our way 
We would do this every day 

We ain't ever gonna grow up 
We just wanna get down 
Tell the DJ turn it up real loud 
No we'll never grow up 
And if we had our way 
We would do this every day 

We ain't ever gonna grow up 
We just wanna get down 
Show everybody who runs this town 
No we'll never grow up 
And if we had our way 
We would do this everyday </pre>
