Chorus (Dre B):

It's kinda funny how you wanna hit me now
it's kinda funny like we was always down

Verse 1 (Cristiles):

I'ts funny ain't it, the way the picture painted
it's funny how they treat you when they think that you finna make it
man it's crazy, wouldn't imagine the shit that I be seein'
these phony homies, these phony bitches, these phony demons
the only reason I'm breathin' through this, is 'cause I gotta
lose a friend every penny, new enemy every dollar
pretendin' to be my patnas, they tellin' me they want me
now that these bitches is on me suckas wanna be my homies
if she thinkin' I'ma cuff her, fuck her and leave her lonely
chopped it up with common sense, never trust 'em what he told me
this is where the saga ends, it's a new beginnin'
they could tell me that they solid but the shoe wouldn't fit 'em
rappers stalkin', watchin' your every move when you winnin'
wanna be you when they see the heated pool full of women
take a view of what's in it, they waitin' on this
what we sayin' though Rich?

(Philthy Rich):

I'm just sayin' though bitch

Chorus (Dre B):

It's kinda funny how you wanna hit me now
it's kinda funny like we was always down
it's kinda funny y'all should get off my dick
it's kinda funny 'cause nah I dont owe y'all shit
x2

Verse 2 (Philthy Rich):

It's kinda funny how this bitch all on me
when I was doin' bad man the bitch ain't want me
now she see a nigga stuntin', she feel I owe her somethin'
broke bitch please, $300 on these jeans
young nigga at the top, and I don't fuck with bops
only dimes and up, yeah them times was tough
and I came from shit, but you ain't hold me down
you switched sides on me fucked my nigga from cross town
34 west you ain't come see a nigga
ain't put no money in my books when I was in Rita nigga
when I was locked down you act like you ain't need a nigga
but now I'm fresh out you act like you need a nigga
it's Philthy

Bridge (Dre B):

You fake niggas calls, not answerin'
you fake bitches calls, not answerin'
no fakeness at all

(Cristiles):

It's funny how you hated 'till I made it

(Dre B):

and now you wanna hit my phone

Verse 3 (Cristiles):

I'm the same guy it ain't lies, treat me like I'm different now
only difference is I'm on a mission to see riches now
laughed at me when I fell but I got up
it's Styles and Dre B you hate me 'cause you not us
you suckas, envious mafuckas
talk behind backs in our face is when you love us
same goes for the hoes thats tryin' to be lovers
baby mothers, you ain't gettin' shit from us you can suck us

Chorus (Dre B):

It's kinda funny how you wanna hit me now
it's kinda funny like we was always down
