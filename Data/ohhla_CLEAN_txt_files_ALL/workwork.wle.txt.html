[Beat starts]
Uh. Lets do it
uh
Floor not havin it
cover this track like a motha fuckin laminate

Yeah,real niggaz in my cabinet
you the type of nigga make a stripper turn celibate

Lets celebrate, levitate, with the loud
never wait when we out
fuck a line, get in now

what they bitchin bout?
what the goin for?
polo head to toe no zone 4

Kick game on rebitz, bonjour
winter time, all clear
summer time, different shore

This a different motor man better go to work
rapper tryin trade places like a motor mur

Its no days off, all though I'm born to work
but daddy gotta order somethin dealers cant afford

Ha, the envy in dime dealers
bentley ain't my but I let bitches recline in em
Tell em they mind clippin I give em like 5 minutes
Tell em we'll never be but they settle for side bitches

Dc got wild niggaz
them .45 niggaz
some runnin with 2 k's though we some loud niggaz

Don't get besides yourself, thinkin I'm with the loving
I just came back from Howard I made a deal for the locals
they hit em, fling em, delete em
hug em, love em, then leave em
if you call me a genius, nobody would disagree it

I'm spotted on different beachs, cause he was smokin reffah
I hope you hit me by 3, I'm incoherent by the evening

whats up sugah, I'm diggin yah, oh you aint feelin young'n?
thats even better I'm not that into submissive woman
I'll like to tell you I'm the type to get all woman
I put that battery in back so small wonder
its been a long summer, and I've been on my grind
we killin shows out in london like I'm on my grind
I think I'm Larry Hoover, I think I'm Big Meech
I think you need the streets to succeed the inner street

but I'm a different route, hip-hop lyric route, quote un quote
backpack still bring them bitches out

I bet you burnt em, you fry chicken nigga church em
or popeyes, we don't keep no birds in the circle

Stop lyin ya'll pretenders ya'll ain't really workin
Ya winslon, within lauren, though you nigga urkel

kin folk, I've been dope since super soakers
no matter who gonna show up I make a move over
all that talk about who's better then falauren
go and get that bread and they'll be penniless tommorrow

Living out of a homer shit
broke and no one notices
ghetto whip you lisa like your margerie and homer kid

Rather beatin on the bitch
motify your quota bitch
PG bitches love me like I'm TCB and Polo bitch

norfitomic love me like a mother fuckin jonahs
thats why we're always goin and we don't gotta go with them</pre>
