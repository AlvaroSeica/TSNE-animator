[Intro: Ace Hood] + (DJ Khaled)
We the motherfuckin' best! (DJ KHALED~!)

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
You haters can't stop me, I'm a franchise
You're now rockin' with the best, put your hands high

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Do it, do it, I'mma fuckin' do it (do it)
These niggas try to hold me back, I swear I've been through it
Middle finger to 'em all, I'mma make 'em pay
PSA for any nigga standin' in the way
You don't want these problems, you-you, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems, nigga you don't want these problems
Oh God! I tell 'em nigga you don't want these problems (I tell em)
You don't, you don't want these problems (I tell em), you don't want these problems

[Rick Ross]
{M-M-M-M-Maybach Music}
Out in Vegas like Lamar, third floor Tropicana (HUH)
Fascinated with the cars, smokin' dope in the Phantom
Teflon's on the rise, I despise propaganda
Camouflage Mac-11, I should set an example
Never baptized, as I walk through the fires (HUH)
The pain and the flame never match my desires~!
Crucified cause I'm rich, in the coupe, take a pic
On the phone at the light, Kelly Rowland's a friend (yeah)
Catfish in the Benz, Manti Teo's a sucker
Plaques on the wall, hustler so I can say "fuck 'em"
Bel Air for the hoes (WOO), Ciroc in the pool (yeah)
My bitch is a stripper, her name is April's A Fool
{Maybach Music}

[Interlude]

[Chorus] - minus last two lines

[French Montana]
Hah! Montana!
I said "HAAAAANH~!" That's what the title say
Cause I'm rich, homie, it's why you feel some kind of way
She threw the pussy and I caught it (caught it), presidential by 40 (40)
That drop hit from Europe (WOOF), that coupe got deported (HAH)
I turn Coke Boy to that corporate money (money), big choppa, I'm walkin' funny (funny)
Money talk but you ain't talkin' money, you ain't even got no corporate money
HAAAAANH! Whip, game, proper, I'mma make it work
Versace (versace), nigga, know who did it first

[2 Chainz]
Yeah, yeah, 2 CHAINZ!
+We The Best+, Khaled tried to told yah (yeah)
TRUUUU! You just second best -- Kelly Rowland (hahaha, I'm just playin' babe)
Uh, +Renegade+ like Em and Jay
VIP section, started out from section 8 (damn!)
Arm and Hammer, I be armed with the hammer
If it was a slumber party, I'd be fresh in pajamas (AOOOWW)
Silence the shawty, I'm killin' them softly
They slept on me, I stopped sellin' work and started sellin' them coffins
TRUUU~!

[Interlude]

[Meek Mill]
Hah! MEEK MILLY! Uhh
I stay jumpin' out that thing ho, I swear that's word to my momma (WOO!)
I took risks with that 'caine, ho and I sold work for my momma (WOO!)
These niggas don't want no drama (NO), these niggas don't want no problems (NO)
These niggas don't want no beef (beef), have 'em walkin' out with that choppa (bah-bah)
These norm niggas don't play that (play that), they murk somethin', I'll tell you that (tell you that)
200 change for this Mulsanne and the +Wheel's a Fortune+ - Pat Sajak (SKRRT)
We catch cases, don't say jack (WOO), don't talk work cause they tape that (WOO)
Don't sell the work where we lay at (NO), and don't spend the bread you can't make back, no

[Ace Hood]
ACE HOOOOOD~!
Rest in peace, I'mma start murderin' and bodyin' beats
Ain't no defeatin' the eye of the beast and I'm laughin' at people who try to compete
Name any rapper that's fuckin' with me, I'm who these niggas pretendin' to be
Claimin' you wantin' these problems, tell momma get flowers and plannin' your funeral speech
My sanctuary's that cemetery, my choppa, named it "Obituary" (bow bow bow)
Act up, Tyler Perry, boy you sweeter than February (hah)
Real nigga, I define that, you don't even need no dictionary
You ain't even 'bout that life, so these shooters with me ain't necessary - AAH

[Chorus: Big Sean]
You don't want these problems, you-you, you don't want these problems
You don't want these problems, nigga you don't want these problems
