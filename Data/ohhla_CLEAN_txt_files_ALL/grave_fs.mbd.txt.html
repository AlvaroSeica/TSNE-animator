[Prodigy]
Aiyyo, they say I'm cold-hearted, well I was born like that
From the womb to my tomb I'll be on it like that
From my cradle to my grave I'll be on that same shit
No bitch can change my ways, I show no care
No thug can shake my frame, I show no fear
Be a cold day in hell once I arrive there
I slap God in the face for puttin me through this torture
{*GOD*} And bust through heaven's gates
{*DAMN*} if they don't wanna let me up
So while I'm still alive and kickin
I'ma run through this planet like I own this shit here
Fuck up out my way 'fore you get yourself fitted
And sized up like tailored for bullets that fit in
the meat on your bones like knives on Thanksgiving
You bird-ass nigga, I'm a mobster, you a pigeon
Make no mistake, there's a difference between us
So when you see my face, turn your head like a slut
Word up, we body niggaz for reckless eyeballin
Niggaz signin record deals and think they ballin
My niggaz make joint ventures and own they mansions
You prostitute-ass nigga, hoe faggot, you a RAPPER
{*DAMN!*}

[Outro]
Okay okay okay, H-A-V-O-C
That nigga P, no doubt that's that gangsta shit son, y'know?  {*gunshot*}

All the time baby
We gon' continue to do this shit like this here
Man y'knowImean?  For y'all peoples {*cocked*}
Cause we know y'all wants this {*gunshot*} shit like this
Y'knahmsayin?  Straight like that

{Shoutout.. Violator.. Chris Lighty!}
{Can't forget.. Mike Lighty.. John Lighty.. HA HA!}  {*gunshot*}
{Non-stop}</pre>
