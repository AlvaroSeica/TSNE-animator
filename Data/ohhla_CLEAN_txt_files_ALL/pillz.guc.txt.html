[Intro]
Geah! Gucci Mane, is in the buildin
So Icy Entertainment, Zaytoven on the track
When we come to the club
We got the choppers on deck, and the yoppers on deck

[Chorus]
[MB] Is you rollin? {*4X*}
[GM] Bitch I might be {*4X*}
[MB] Girl he geeked up {*4X*}
[GM] Bitch I might be {*4X*}
[GM] Yaaaaahhh!

[Gucci Mane]
East Atlanta slum man is where I come from
Pass that bubble thrax and put this band on your tongue
Now everything was gravy 'til yo' bitch came in
'Bout the same time that that thang kicked in
Now she ain't really pretty but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up thinkin this Buffy the Body
Ain't yo' name lil' Trina cause you look like Janet Jackson
I'm on three double stacks and I'm lookin for that action
Gucci Mane you stupid man I love the way you flowin
Ridin in my drop but I don't know where I'm goin
On 285 I keep ridin in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin like a pound of purple
"Gucci showtime!" Give me five more minutes
and a cold orange juice cause I'm really really trippin
Went to the strip club and requested "I'm the Man"
The next thang you know I was throwin rubber bands

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Shawty tellin me she ain't never suck no dick
Never took a pill, or never ate a bitch
You a liar, but I ain't gon' get upset right now
But I wish I had a lie detector test right now
You say you married well bitch you might be
But I bet your husband ain't icy like me
She stepped on B.C. in my ashy black tee
With them dope man Nikes and them Jordache jeans
On paper but I still keep that thrax on me
I'm the shit in East Atlanta baby ask about me
Pop one, pop two, two halves that's three
Aint no waffle house baby hell I cain't eat
Gucci hood like your hood, man he's so street
Wearin Dolce's in the club cause you know the boy geeked
Top the top on that thang let you see my seats
We've been rollin rollin rollin, we ain't slept in weeks

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane, Laflare nigga get your mind right
Order Crist' by the twelve like a case of Bud Light
Sell kush by the bell so you know my shit tight
See I'm 30 in the mornin on an all night flight
I'm high like Fabo, hood like Shawty
So +Tell Me Where to Go+ like my name E-40
A rich rock star nigga I'm gon' party
Got a party pack of pills that's at least 'bout 40
I'll pour 'em in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pills call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pills man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill that's a damn good deal

[Chorus]

[Mac Bre-Z]
Ay whassup Gucci Mane!
Why you sweatin so hard?
Is you rollin or somethin?

[Gucci Mane]
Shit well baby I might be
But got damn what is you doin?
You jockin a playa, you chew-chewy over here right
Look I aint K-Rab baby knahmean I'm not a piece of bubblegum
What I'm doin is not your business
But matter of fact while you over here is you a waitress or somethin?
Cause the shit you got on make you look like you a waitress
So do what you do aight I'ma give you this hundred dollars
Go get you whatever you drankin
Bring me and my clique about ten of them orange juices
five Crunk juices and we'll be straight how 'bout that
And is you straight is you single or is you married?
Cause I might be, bitch I might be
Bitch I might be, bitch I might be
YAAAAAAAHH</pre>
