Stir up the bass with the accelerator
Stir up the bass when the way you're coming later
Stir up the bass the Bomfunk creator
Stir up the bass when the way you're coming later

Boom boom, with the accelerator
Boom boom, when the way you're coming later
Boom boom, the Bomfunk creator
Boom boom, when the way you're coming later

Stir up the bass with the accelerator
Stir up the bass when the way you're coming later
Stir up the bass the Bomfunk creator
Stir up the bass when the way you're coming later

Boom boom, with the accelerator
Boom boom, when the way you're coming later
Boom boom, the Bomfunk creator
Boom boom, when the way you're coming later

Stir up the bass with the accelerator
Stir up the bass when the way you're coming later
Stir up the bass the Bomfunk creator
Stir up the bass when the way you're coming later

Boom boom, with the accelerator
Boom boom, when the way you're coming later
Boom boom, the Bomfunk creator
Boom boom, when the way you're coming later</pre>
