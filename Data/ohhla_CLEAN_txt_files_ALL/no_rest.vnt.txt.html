[Vents]
Cinematic massacres, purges, murders, animal urges
Militarism returned, made a massive resurgence
Unkind is a word just scratching the surface
Got me thinking that humanity, it has to be worthless
Like, without god could we have any purpose?
And if he exists, tell me why the fuck would he hurt us?
My black metal burning down flammable churches
If man made the world, what's a natural occurrence?
Like, colonialism, that showed me the wisdom
of racism and other social and phoney divisions
I'm having serious doubts about reaching nirvana
I barely learnt to sit down and speak to my father
Need a reason to bother or a morsel of truth
You forced to consume rhythms that will cause you to move
And Ad-Fu getting caught in the groove
My brethren is a deadly weapon, records left sore and abused, yep

[Chorus: 2X]
"So here we go again scaring people to death" - MC Ren
Vents One, Ad-Fu, Mr. Trials in effect
"So here we go, so here we go again scaring people to death" - MC Ren
It's no rest for the wicked when the wicked connect

[Vents]
We stay close to the danger, sort of like dope in Malaysia
Super-high, purify smoke in the chamber
Blow for blow, I'm smoking Joe Frazier
Open up the cut, no soap on the razor, what?
I'm just a bloke from Australia
watching all the boats rocking up and most folks going Kramer, huh
Hang 'em from a tree, blast 'em in the sea
Want your money, and your life, and your marketing degree
Gotta laugh cause it's funny when you pass me in the street
Pissing up with Trials, smoking darts with Debris
Got polar caps and rising seas
So hurry up, kill 'em all, feed my disease
I'm starving, fighting with the mice for the cheese
MasterChef at night with the rice and beans
Rap sweet like Daryl Braithwaite
It's a cannibal feast on the streets when my release date takes shape

[Chorus: 2X]

[Vents]
The emptiness is endless, entire existence horrendous
My symptom persistent, the pain is relentless
The sentence is death, we dwell is call centres
Very long days and very short tempers
I'm back with a vengeance, it's Vents the villain
You bite my whole style and blow up, make a killing
I Kurt Cobain your face, stain on the ceiling
Look brilliant, you burn like the plane hit the building
Get torched, charred up, scarred, black as fuck
Eat shit, two girls, one pack the cup
That's what's up, flesh bubbling from the heat
You bloodsucker, vampire, put the fucker to sleep
You in bed with the enemy
Rhyme for the pussy and the money with your head up his arse, human centipede
Lost in the veins of metropolis
Strangers and foreigners, everybody faceless, anonymous, what?

[Chorus: 2X]</pre>
