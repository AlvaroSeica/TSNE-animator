[Intro]
YOU CAN'T STOP ME!!!!!

[Andy Mineo]
Hanh?! Can't stop won't stop, where the brakes at?
I give 'em that Diddy bop, like take that, take that, take that, take that
I'ma put in work, I'ma do that ASAP
Throw my faith in rap, but they say don't say that hanh?
What I'ma turn down fo'? Feel like Shaq in nine fo'
Breakin glass of that backboard, or like Kobe in Toronto hanh?
Drive an eighty-one, yo I drop that eighty-eight
Ricky Bobby, shake and bake; sleepin on us should have stayed awake hanh?
Everybody make mistakes, like VJ's trying to say my name
It's MINNY-OH - say it with me; Mineo - okay, great
Two forks high, raise the stakes, risk it all, I take the hate
It's the winning team, get the Gatorade
My God good, but he's not safe, naw

[Chorus]
They try to shut us down, and it ain't gon' slide
Only thing I fear is God and he on my side
That's the confidence of God, cause he got me
That's why I really feel like YOU CAN'T STOP ME!!!!!
Uhh, that's all you got? Come on with it
That's all you got? YOU CAN'T STOP ME!!!!!
(You) don't got the power (can't) shut me down
(Stop) that's not an option, I'm my biggest problem
(You) don't got the power (can't) shut me down
(Stop) that's not an option, YOU CAN'T STOP ME!!!!!

[Andy Mineo]
Heh, you're my biggest opponent, you know me I know you we know it
Whenever I fail, you've always been there to simply remind me I've blown it
You don't see when I'm growin, you don't see where I'm goin
You only see in the moment, you know my mistakes, you never let go it
Huh, don't cease to amaze me, and it drive me crazy, hanh?
That you catch every detail that I miss in the songs I'm makin, sayin
You will never write a verse like Kendrick
Never be the rap or rock God from Hendrix
Top ten alive you will never be mentioned
Why aim so high, won't survive the trenches
Plus, you a Christian Andy
They will never listen Andy
Plus, where your pigment Andy? Huh
You don't got skill you a gimmick, Andy~!!
Well, if I listened to you
and everything you put in my ear
I'll be living like woulda, shoulda, coulda
I'd be paralyzed by fear
Heh, ain't that the truth, if I quit the only way I lose
I got two choices when I do this - make moves or make excuses
Hanh? If you know who I'm talking about, then you got me
My biggest enemy is me - and even I can't stop me

[Chorus]

[Andy Mineo - repeat 4X]
I said if I cannot stop me then you'll never stop me
Oh no, can't stop, oh no, won't stop
