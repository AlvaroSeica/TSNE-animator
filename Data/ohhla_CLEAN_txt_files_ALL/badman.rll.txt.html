Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Scratchy]
He kept squeezing but he's missing the point
He never had his head screwed on from a boy
The boys that he rolled with they weren't his boys
He didn't realise then he was with the wrong crowd
He don't listen, that's why he won't learn anything,
Earn anything or turn anything around
He don't use his loaf when he's on the roads
That's why his life turned round, upside down
Of course there was gonna be consequences
When jumping fences, you will get court and sentenced.
That's a bad look and entrance
Keep it up, he won't see his pension
Watch me I'll live till I'm older
If he likes leng so much, go army and be a soldier
I don't care what that badman told you,
You can be a badman with out a revolver

[Chorus: Breeze/Flowdan]
He's a big man, does what he wants
He's a badman, doesn't response
Where is he going, what's he gonna be
Watch what happens, wait and see

He's a big man, does what he wants
He's a badman, doesn't response
Where is he going, what's he gonna be
Watch what happens, wait and see

[Verse 2: Breeze]
Got a gully little friend
Little gully man, gully with a leng
Billa know that he's bate on the ends
Lives for da road, more time in pen
He's blessed with me but G-d's not reaching him
Wasting time trying to preach to him
This boy needs help, like nobody can't chat to him
All been there done poop for a laugh
Run a muck ran up da wrong path
Been a prick done crazy shit
Karmas a bitch dats just the half
Youts go missin in da system
Get banged up like sonny liston
Come back worse then they went in
Pissed cause nobody missed em

[Chorus: Breeze/Flowdan]
He's a big man, does what he wants
He's a badman, doesn't response
Where is he going, what's he gonna be
Watch what happens, wait and see

He's a big man, does what he wants
He's a badman, doesn't response
Where is he going, what's he gonna be
Watch what happens, wait and see

[Verse 3: Jet Le]
So what's he gonna do? Wants to do this?
Roll with the mash with the 2 clips?
Unload the shells for a few kicks?
Make em do summersaults, back flips?
After the drama he made that change
Hot headed from a younger to get that name
Other men fear him, dither and jowal
But police catch him, it's straight prison
Never occurred to him to just think
"Your life means more than this"
Take another mans life there's more to it
Sit down for it
Some end up in jail
Some lose the plot
I know what it's like if they disrespect
Use your intellect, get them in another way
Clean heart, and live and over stand this
A wise man will learn but a fool never will

[Chorus: Breeze/Flowdan]
He's a big man, does what he wants
He's a badman, doesn't response
Where is he going, what's he gonna be
Watch what happens, wait and see

He's a big man, does what he wants
He's a badman, doesn't response
Where is he going, what's he gonna be
Watch what happens, wait and see

[Verse 4: Flow Dan]
These are some serious times
And it's only getting worse cause the streets ain't nice
It was 1996 one time at chimes
When he first heard a gunshot blud, he had to hide
Two double O six, we're in the same mix
And teenagers are rolling with nines ain't the lick
And they're shooting each other on idiot shit
Like: "man he tried it, does he think I'm a prick? "
Nah... But I bet you felt like one
Waiting for a visit and your visit don't come
But when the door shuts, it's just you and you one
And that's because of you and what you did with a mash
Now look your family's not safe
Revenge is wanted and you're locked away
It's a circle of pain that never goes away
All because of one gunshot that you bus' that day</pre>
