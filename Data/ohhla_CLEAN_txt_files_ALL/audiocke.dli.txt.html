[Verse 1]
My shit sells, tell your folk's
[Nigga) I'm no joke
My lines make your ears bleed I'm audio coke
I'm audio blow
You snort this threw your ear lobs
A natural high, this is pumped all over the globe
I'm worth, more then gold
Got pushers on every corner I Take control
Of these so-called streets
My whole network, is underground, kept underneath
The black market
Sell my rhymes and my beats
And weak niggaz O.D.
Off my music
If I told you once, (I) told you twice not to abuse it
I bake niggaz lose it
They fiend for mine
Your heart starts racing like the deep bass line
They say I've committed a crime by coming on in
Like heroin in a syringe
A friend to a friend
A testament that the war on drugs just ain't working
The nose candy got me the Benz, that I merk in
I'm 24 hours
Like Perkings
My fine white powder
Is addictive to the third person
A certain, cause for concern, the laws inforced
Here's a hit if, niggaz want to ride the white horse
Feel the rush of adrenaline
Fucked by my medicine
Built in the lab, down in my basement
So good you can taste it (one sniff)
It's dope
I'm drugs to your ears son, I'm audio coke
I,m audio blow...

[Chorus]
"The aroma reaches up to my nostrils"

[Verse 2]
When I'm boiled to perfection, I rock
I'm made for your block
Created for the street's I get cut like crack rock
You're boom box, gets hot
And spreads my waves
That's how I get paid
Niggaz become slaves
Addicted to the way
Yo I smoke the MIC?
Inhale the fumes, produced take you up to knew heights
I sport the new Nikes plus a big gold chain
I'm the cousin of cocaine
But worst for your brain
My audio is not what you use in moderation
Get heavy rotation, On radio stations
I'm what your parents hate for real
Make the product your kids buy
And the record stores sell
From half to a mill
I make niggaz kill
I'm independent so I go where I feel
For real
Bring the Ruckus
2 tears and a bucket
The more they hate this, the more the fans love it
And the cops can't touch it
We much crook's wiser
The dealer ain't problem, nigga it's the supplier
Where there's smoke, there's fire
Take a toke, you desire
More of this you require
Then purchase the album
Like thousands caught up in the web we weave
At first we practice to deceive
So strong you can here it, one line it's dope
I'm drugs to your ears son, I'm audio coke
I'm audio blow...

[Chorus]
"The aroma reaches up to my nostrils"</pre>
