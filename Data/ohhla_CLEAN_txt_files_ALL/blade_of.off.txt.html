Typed by: IDB@code-poets.net

I am a blade of grass
One of many
My brothers are countless
And so are my enemies
I grew from seed
I am a blade of grass
One of many
My brothers come in many types
From many countries
But we all grow from seed
Some are born in cultures
A lawn in the suburbs
Fed and protected by the overlord
With the jean shorts and the fertilizer
They are strong and safe together
But when they grow up tall
Like individuals
Their god cuts them all
Til they are beautiful
All the same, all pawns in a larger game
I've heard of grass
My distant brothers
Who must fight to survive on their own
They know not
Of the lawnmower
They are savage
Their quality of life is much harder
If only they'd realize
They could be saved
If it wasn't for our god
We would fear them
Who would save us from savages?
Block our sun and drink our water
If they could

Bow down now and worship the lawnmower
He controls your fate
You are in his domain
He will save you from the evils of the world
As soon as you fall in line
I am a blade of grass
Compassionate
I want to save all my brothers
Systematically
To preserve the peace
Other blades of grass
My brothers
Who weren't pretty in the eyes of our god
Tried to unite with our lawn
In our sod
But our god
Who we all give our lives to
Poisoned our brothers
I watched them burn in the sun
And fall to their deaths
So I left the lawn
Into the wilderness
And I fear drought and insects and weeds
But I will always be free
With no lawnmower controlling me
I am a blade of grass
One of many
How long until the lawnmower finds me?
And what I can do about it when he does?
I am no match, a single blade of grass

Bow down now and worship the lawnmower
But when they grow up tall
He controls your fate
Like individuals
You are in his domain
Their God cuts them all, til they are beautiful
He will save you from the evils of the world
All The same, all pawns in a larger game
As soon as you fall in line</pre>
