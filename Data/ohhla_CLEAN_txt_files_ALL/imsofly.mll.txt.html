You Know Me I'm So Fly
Be lookin Like Money everytime I Ride By
Got Dem Benjies IN My Pocket and Money On MY Mind
If It Ain't About No Paper Then It Ain't about I
Cause I Get GEt GEt It Money I Get
When I Step Up IN Da Club I Be Fellin Like I'm Mitch
When I Be THe Hood I Be Ridin With CHo Bitch
You Know She Probably On My Dick
BEcause I'm Probably The Shit

I say I got my first bit of money thought I knew it all
Went to MIA south beach blew it all
Came back to the hood trappin super hard
Super down look at me now Superstar
In dat black on black Charger rims soy sauce
Bunch of diamonds in ma chain da wrist[? ]
Bitches gimmie head and tail like a quater toss
Cause I just signed to grand hustle I'm for sure to ball
I say we be the freshest
Jewlery be vvs'n
Caddy be dts'n
Like Khalad shit we the best
And I tell dem hoes I don't wanna talk just leave a message
Automatic stash boxes so they can't see the weapons
But I be GT reppin Grand Hustle the muscle
No we don't love these whores I jus love wen I fuck em
No I don't tuck em nor do I love em or cuff em
I jus hit em and spplit em pass em off to ma cousin

[Chorus]
You Know Me I'm So Fly
Be lookin Like Money everytime I Ride By
Got Dem Benjies IN My Pocket and Money On MY Mind
If It Ain't About No Paper Then It Ain't about I
Cause I Get GEt GEt It Money I Get
When I Step Up IN Da Club I Be Fellin Like I'm Mitch
When I Be THe Hood I Be Ridin With CHo Bitch
You Know She Probably On My Dick
BEcause I'm Probably The Shit</pre>
