[Intro: Jhene Aiko] (DJ Tedsmooth)
Don't take this personal, better act like you know
(TEDSMOOTH! STRAIGHT FACE! U REMEMBER!!!)
In the way, funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you want, nothing was ever the same
And though I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you
I still want you! Ohhhhhhhh!!!
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I!!!! But I love you!!!

[Verse One: Raekwon]
Six days deep she left she left a letter on the stove
This how it go you violated Chef
I know you was the mayor but playa I never knew it would come
To my love rolled in, then you got numb
I'm uptown washin the wraith, guess who run up on me?
Little strawberry come on with this, break
Yo arguin, put your feet on my shit, botherin me
Tears in my eyes you dead wrong pardon me
Faith the magical word crack a few nerves yo
She had integrity expected me to swerve
But I didn't, stood right there I know my limits
Know my ground know my surroundings knowin that I'm finished
Damn another one lost what more divorce you 'gon break me
It's tax time now that's like extortion
Why me the flyest of all to keep it irie
This is a black man's diary
Why me queen?

[Verse Two: Jhene Aiko]
Tell me what you say now? Tell me what you say come again?
If you cannot stay down, then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out, I should've never let you in
'Cause you got me phased out
And don't take this personal, but you're the worst you know what you done to me
And although it hurts I know, I just can't keep runnin away
(I can't keep runnin away, I can't keep runnin away, And I can't keep runnin away)

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you!
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you!

[Verse Three: Jhene Aiko]
Tell me what you say now, tell me what you say?
You said that you would come again
You said that we would remain friends but, you know that I do not depend
On nothing or no one, so why would you show up?
So uninvited, then, just change my mind like that
Please don't this personal, you weren't special 'til I made you, you better act like you know
That I've been though worst than you, I just can't keep runnin away
(I can't keep runnin away, I can't keep runnin away, And I can't keep runnin away)
But I don't need you!

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you! (But I want you!)
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you! (But I love you!)

[Verse Four: Jhene Aiko]
Everybody's like, he's no item, please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em
I never listen no, I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin so unoriginal
But it was you so I was with it, and to tell you the truth, wish we never did it
'Cause I usually do, stick to the business
But you came out the blue, then and you just flipped it
God damn baby my mind's blown
Be forgettin you live in a different time zone
Thinkin I know what this is it's just my time's wrong
Yeah I know what you did but baby I'm grown
And my love is patient and kind of sick
This is where we could build, through different types of shit
If you was really the realest you wouldn't be fightin it
I think your pride is just, I think your pride is just

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you!
I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you!</pre>
