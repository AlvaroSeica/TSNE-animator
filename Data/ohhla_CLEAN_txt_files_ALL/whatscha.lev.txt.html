Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com

"Can you feel it?"

[Chorus] [x4]
What's that cha say about the west coast huh?
You got flava (yeah)
Anotha Level (right)

[Verse One] [Ced Twice]
Well it's the west side
Dressed right slim, 5'10" with an in
Young scandalous, straight from Los Angeles
Ahhhh
I feels splorific
And it's so nice to be close to the Pacific
These looks out here are way wild under covers
But can't fade the brother cause my Level is Another
So honey don't try it
Because I don't buy it
I wait for a verdict, and loot it in the riots
Another Lev-el be maxin' and taxin'
Always got some time for, time for some action
Hungry got the munchies and my tummy's feelin' awful
Stopped at Rascoe's for chicken and waffles
The west's got flavor
Congratulations
My third leg is fatter than a Jenny Craig patient
So honey if I wax the tush we'll keep on the (shhhh!)
I was in it like Clinton, now I'm out like Bush

[Bambino]
Who said the west coast ain't got flavor?
"Can you feel it? Nothin' can save ya." - Biz Markie 'Vapors'
We wreck shop then break out like small pox
If I'm not home hops, hit me on my box
I hit you back if I got time for the jocks
Cause honey's be on mine from Baghdad to Bangkok 
I'm macadashious
Call me Mac-oh-so
Girly's tell me my flavor's so delic-e-oh-so
So hey honey dipper
Unzip my zipper
And let me introduce you to the big fad flipper
My style is large like a Skipper
This one's for the west
So motherfucker the Gipper
Baggy sacks, I packs 
I cacks cacks
Sacks...sacks
Hacks I tag sacks
So don't ask
The meaning
This one's for the west
So now try to see me

[Chorus] [x4]
What's that cha say about the west coast huh?
You got flava (yeah)
Anotha Level (right)

[Verse Three] [Stenge]
We can say anything and still get props
Like "Eek", "Ock", "Oak", "Ock Ock"
Translation means that you're swingin' on my jock
I'm givin' lessons
Cause I've been known to school one
Ditch my class and I slide you a cool one
To the grill as I spill my rap skills
Step back Jill I'm jumpin' over the hill
So I can slide, slide, slippity slide
Up in you to the left
Riiiiight
Left with my full metal jacket and nine tec
Cause I live in the place where the sun sets
From the wild west 
Me and my crew yo
On Anotha Level, style is fatter than a sumo
So yeah, Bambino
Pass me that foil
Gotta seal up my rhymes so they don't spoil
I'm not a king
But you can crown me royal
To the west my devotion is loyal

[Chorus] [x4]
What's that cha say about the west coast huh?
You got flava (yeah)
