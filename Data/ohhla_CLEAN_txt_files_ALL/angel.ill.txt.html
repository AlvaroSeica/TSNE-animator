[Illogic]
I stand in the belly of oblivion
seeing light strobe past me, at uncomparable speeds of rushing wind
I take a step towards the laboreth of life
where it's pearly gates of white perplex me
I enter its doors of glittering ivory
and was met by streets of gleeming gold
that seem to lead into infinity
curious I took the road to an unknown destination
endured my down down the street of precious metal
with thoughts of confusion racing though my metnal
nevertheless I continued the journey
looking around I noticed crowds of clouds floating through this abyss of
beauty as if it were home
alone I proceed to watch for any signs of life
any signs that might give me a sense of my surroundings
then off in the distance I notice a glowing white figure
it would appear to be a platinum fountain gathering drink to her lips
as I pulled closer to this vision a set of wings grabbed my attention
to get closer, I had to, to check if this being was reality
the nearer I got, the realer she became
with flowing curly hair of a brownish brunette and
I take it she felt my presence as she turned my direction
aqua green eyes locked to mine
as the sites of a crossbow with its target
centuries of thoughts, epics of words were exchanged in this blare
stare is all that came to mind
at a loss of speech I, was standing in amazement

now is it possible that she, is it possible that we
is it possible that me, her, us, is inevitable
confrontation amazing, incredible, fabolous
though I'm human, her angelic
(if it wasn't love I wouldn't of felt it)

but its definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at first sight

her left appendix was extended to grace my face with the presence of her skin
the texture of her touch though of silk spun in the depths of Asia
her lips plump and sweet this being completely beautiful
from the root of her hair to the soul of her pedicure
still my muscles were stagnant(inactive)
I still handn't moved from the initial eyes locking so I appeared passive
shocking fact of how attractive being of the next world
to often I had to press girls to give me second look
but now I'm taken it was as if she saw into my soul and I, her's
its complexity had me perturbed(disturbed) that soceity's acceptance of her and I
but it seemed God was okay with it, he let our paths cross
still at a loss of words I strechd my arms just to touch her robe
to my knees I tossed, my body to worship this godess of my resurrection
she had to be the closest thing to next to God himself
love like this never experienced before or ever will be again
she's my friend that shield me from the pain and anguish of living
never exchanged the word, our thoughts were from
the "hello"'s to the "how are you"'s to the "I love you"'s
she grabbed my hands, led me to the land of milk and honey
life and prosperity, my wife she was preparing to be
we sat in a garden of roses and other, exotic flowers
still just exchanging thoughts as butterfly's landed on the tips of our noses
we held hands, her beauty was overwhelming I couldn't stand to stare
so I close my elids to rest of it
still she was there, I felt her gental touch to the chest
this heavenly voice spoke those three words, my heart began to race faster
felt the touch of those lips on my cheek, open my eyes to complete darkness
went for the lightswitch for illumination
wondering what type of twist or turn took my situation
to my surprise I was met by those eyes and that hair that stare, no wings
but it wasn't a dream, it was you my love
my earth angel, the real thing the real thing

I know now that she, I know now that we, me, her, us, in inevitable
confrontation amazing, incredible, fabolous
though I'm human, her angelic
if it wasn't love I wouldn't of felt it
but its definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at second glance but first sight
definietly love at first sight
