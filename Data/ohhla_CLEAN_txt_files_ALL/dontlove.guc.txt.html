Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: repeat 2X]
I love things about her; I love the way she treat me
I love the way she fuck me; I love the way she suck me

[Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci! It's Gucci
I'm a trapaholic, all I do is ball
Tear the mall down, naw trick, don't flag me down
See me downtown 'Rari, I didn't mean to shit on you
Excuse me sorry, verse so slick
Make my video marvelous, Polo to the flo'
Ralph down like Carlton, try the CEO
They gon' put you on a carton; I didn't mean no harm
But my diamonds are dumb, plenty rocks on my arm
Me and Rocko the Don, East Atlanta the slum
where I'm from, got a gun, in the club havin fun
And after it's done no more coaches to call it
After party bachelor party they shoulda called it

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I love things about her (but I don't love her)
I love the way she treat me (but I don't love her)
I love the way she fuck me (but I don't love her)
I love the way she suck me (still don't love her)

[Rocko]
Man I love the way she shake it, I like it cause she groovin
Love to see her naked, I love to watch her move it
I like her she the coolest, good head on her shoulders
I love the way she use it
Ay, I like the way she fuck me, love the way she suck me
Love how e'rytime we play she catch it like rugby
I love she know whassup with me, she love me cause I'm gutter
I like a lot about her though and still I don't love her (nah~!)
Still super cool though, yeah she my lil' buddy
She be sharper than a pencil; yeah she my lil' cutty
Shorty say I'm dirty but when I see her she wanna hug me
Super swag, charismatic, all my bitches love me

[Chorus]

[Webbie]
I love it! Webbie, ha
I love how she be swallowin my nut, then she be throwin me up
Love how she fuck but still I hate when she be blowin me up
All the busters'll sweat her, only ballers can get her
She a flipper, I love how she do whatever I tell her
Yeah I like her a lot, but still I don't love her at all
I hate pussy-ass niggaz and I'm in love with the mall
I got a crush on white diamonds and I got a thang for that kush
That sour diesel my favorite, you better watch how you look
Quick to take ya lil' diva then treat that hoe like a slut
She was suckin on Gucci, I had my dick in her butt
You know I'm bad bitch crazy, 187's my favorite
Infatuated with money, free Boosie boo, the streets crazy

[Chorus]</pre>
