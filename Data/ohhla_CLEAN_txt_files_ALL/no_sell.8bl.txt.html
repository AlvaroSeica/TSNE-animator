[Koncrete]
Spark the weed up turn the beat up let's get it popping
It's on we dropping that homegrown ghetto to ghetto topic
Flip shit rip shit quick bit sick with this shit here
Explicit content misfits fear now let's get this shit clear
This instant right here
Set it I bet it they won't forget it I wrote I edit
Call the paramedic
Said I meant it still in it to win it
From start to finish no gimmick
Got to give spinach ya timid
I'm rugged so fuck it I love it
Dogs we stay above it corrupted
From dawn to dusk so we can thug it (Naw)

To all my broken kinfolkin stressing keep on smoking
Nick and Slick, Tone and Mint gotta hit the grind again
Living dirty gots to get with it time to go and get it
8ways we represent it all my noggins is demented
Better watch them cars that's tinted you don't want to be up in it
Swish this tre like Hardaway send they soldiers far away
But I'm living on the corner got this hardened marijuana
Know it's wrong but fuck that leave me where the bucks at
Last year was hard this one looking even worser now
Chilled from the start but my anger got me colder now
Whatcha really gon' do round here
We stuck like Chuck and we can't get out
On the block and I'ma sell them rocks
Rock come through and we got to open up shop
(Yeah Koncrete Eightball like this right here)

Yeah yeah that's how we do it nigga

[Chorus: 4x]
When I open up my mouth you can hear the south
Packing guns stacking funds fuck selling out

[Eightball]
I got my nigga's with me
You got a problem with something
I say then come get me
I'm in a southern city sipping on some cold Remy
At the club looking at girls with big ass and titties
The instrumental that you hearing came from Frank Nitti
We do it big keep it gangsta got to stay gritty
We on the rise real fast like gas prices
The industry is bland so we came to add spices
Heat it up beat it up thugs treat it up
Transform it into something that's complete with us
You didn't know I run with killers on a regular
Conceal weapons rhyme skill is spectacular
Little Nicky got my back baby bear witness
Get past him and you gonna have to deal with Tony Dimples
Deon and Mint Green make it seem so simple
8ways representing making other crews cripple
You know I, you know I.. I..

[Chorus: 4x]

[Koncrete]
We rugged like cave-dwellers them haters be way jealous
They speaking that haterism you need to behave fellas
We banging fo' sho now you'd think we be slow now
Them 'Bama boys ripping hard we make you say oh now
I never come synthetic the lyrical diabetic
You should be apologetic for spittin shit so pathetic
So roll up the marijuana we hotter than Arizona
Don't make Lil' Man put it on ya
You sweating me like a sauna
My nigga get real with it from here to Mobile with it
We showing y'all still with it so nigga just deal with it
Koncrete and the Fat Mack we sip on that cognac
So let's get this platinum plaque so we can watch paper stack

I be that nigga from the 'Bama 'Bama got plenty of monogrammar
Call me yo pussy-rammer dumping dick in yo mamma-jamma
Pose for that camera cat be sweeter than Tropicana
All for the fashion but I be like yo fuck the glamour
My country grammar have bitches come out of pajama
But not the shady one that get you throwed off in the slammer
Me and my fama out there dirty be actin nutty with ?Buddy?
Keeping it smutty even the ?butty cut it what?
Busters ain't wonder what they facing
Niggas got them thoughts that longer than tele-communications
Wait for the ?room of incubrations?
Slab we be blazing spitting that southern incantations

[Chorus: 4x]

[Eightball]
When I open up my... Damn hold up is that it?</pre>
