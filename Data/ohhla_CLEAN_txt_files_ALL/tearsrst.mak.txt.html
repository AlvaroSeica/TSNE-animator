[Intro: Makeba Mooncycle]
Mmm, it's implication of the heart...
As I close my eyes and I'm in this
I clinch my fist at all of this madness
It's now been a few years, without you here, my dear
Your my greatest, now here's my latest

[Makeba Mooncycle]
For the love of my kingdom, I often take risks
I exist with the flow of time, equal cyphers of rhymes
Feel the wetness, my eyes have the redness
Always at war with myself, decisions bad for my health
You little birds pon my doorsteps, dropping jewels like bandits
My emotions got me open, third eye start to scoping
The pressure to my heart, steady piercing like a dart
My cup runeth over, wisdom makes me solar
Reality's a blessing, it keeps the weak mind guessing
Here's the answer to your question, relinquish negative sections
Poisonous like venom, my heart's set to get 'em
Knowledging your fears, fighting back your tears
Understanding the lessons of receiving, new blessings
And if I'm not quite clear, I wanna make things clears
I'm just shedding more tears, I'm just shedding more tears

[Chorus 4X: Makeba Mooncycle]
Truth, Equality, Allah, let's me Rule
Like Tears of a clown, now, who plays the fool?

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Shattered like glass, I think we went to fast
No time with you here, to walk beside my tear
Holding you never, remembering together
Exist on a throne, then why is love alone
Went forth with another, creation by the other
But I got the love jones, recreated by the poems
Mister chit-chat, for me, you into that
No one could take a place, just you I wanna face
He was half of my team, we were tight like seeds
To build was his hustle, I never had to tussle
Always legit, but quick was his exit
Didn't know what I was landed, alone and left stranded
My heart is forever branded, sometimes I just can't stand it
Sooth the way my fears, before I shed more tears
I'm still shedding more tears, I'm still shedding more tears

[Chorus 4X]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
I'm still falling by the waistline, the bassline, I case mine
You chase mine, in no time, I'm out of mine, tempted by white lines
We only want American dream
Though we were part of a team, and you put us to sleep
With no, knowledge to reach, build this rich nation on starvation
Trying to control our population, jobs won like plantations
They want to end our relation, whose the real and whose faking
They say it's there for the taking, another life forsaken
With uncivilized mating, peace to the father
Who rest, in the heavens, God be the name, thy kingdom come
Thy will be done, on Earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread, so we can get ahead
Why do they blame us for these games, shave their heads in shame
Rap stars are now martyrs, children still without fathers
Sometimes you feel inferior, or because they trynna kill ya
I know the whole will hears I flood the world with tears
Flood the world with tears...

[Chorus 8X]</pre>
