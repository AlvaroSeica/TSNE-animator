Yeah, all you slow thinkers
Move to the right, signal with your blinkers
Move come on

You bring out the worst in me
I said you bring out the worst in me
Well now you bring out the worst in me
You bring out the worst

Now don't you hate it when other people bring you down?
Get you all depressed every time they come around
Shoot out your ideas like there much greater but they aint
done shit when you talk to them later
Steal your concepts never return the favor
Everytime they do a little sumthin and its major
Your minder, their hatin on your girlfriend
Just cuz shes finer then theirs
If they even have one
You run around, tryin to get your stuff done pre sun down
They call you, you give em the run down
They act like your dissin
You start believing them
Side track from the mission
Listen
I've put in work
And I've paid hella dues
I've been hella broke
But now I never choose to snooze
I bruise my brain
Thinkin up ways
I can make the most of my days

All my people are big risk takers
No time wasters
Nothings left to lose all slow thinkers
Signal with blinkers
Theres no space left
If your spaced out move
I said..
All my people are big risk takers
No time wasters
Nothings left to lose all slow thinkers
Signal with blinkers
Theres no space left
If your spaced out move

You bring out the best in me
You bring out the best in me
Well now you bring out the best in me
I said you bring out the best

Now don't you love it when your friends get you thinkin?
Do something innovative never even thought of
Get you all inspired and fired up to live life
You tell em what they did what tight your fully motivated
You might have hesitated now your on the move though
Without some of my friends I probably  move too slow
If that aint cool so I need reinforcements
And to be around positivity makes more sense
Its intense
Tryin to top a legend
But I make due and get praise for my rappin
Then they taught me and the lass is the past
It keeps me on point with my foot on the gas
You gotta give respect where its due and stay true
Its neither all about them nor all about you
Surround yourself with prosperous people
If you will try hard to be more than equal

All my people are big risk takers
No time wasters
Nothings left to lose all slow thinkers
Signal with blinkers
Theres no space left
If your spaced out move
I said..
All my people are big risk takers
No time wasters
Nothings left to lose all slow thinkers
Signal with blinkers
Theres no space left
If your spaced out move

Well if your layin down with dogs then your gettin up with fleas
Negativity stay away from me please
I earned my spot and I got plans to keep it
I work very hard for what I got thats the secret
Maybe I can be it I can damn sure try
No need for approval and no one to tell me why
Im doin wrong man Im just makin songs
When its night its on and to the day its on too
Like I am to the next I wanna bless you
And stress through my writing
Reaching a goal is exciting
A challenge thats inviting
And sitting around on your ass is worse then biting
I like igniting thoughts within a stranger
Having them tell me I did the making another banger
Then catching another kid of his guard
Who didn't know my old shit was hard

All my people are big risk takers
No time wasters
Nothings left to lose all slow thinkers
Signal with blinkers
Theres no space left
If your spaced out move
I said..
All my people are big risk takers
No time wasters
Nothings left to lose all slow thinkers
Signal with blinkers
Theres no space left
If your spaced out move</pre>
