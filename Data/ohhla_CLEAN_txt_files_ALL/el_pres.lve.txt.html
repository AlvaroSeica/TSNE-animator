Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We've been drinking all this champagne
It would be a shame if you left now
Keep your dress on, don't change!
Leave on your high heels even when you lay down.
You ain't scared to get physical, would you, babe?
I hope not! Skip money, don't make no money!
And if you want, all of your friends can come with you, babe!
Whatever it takes to keep you from running, yeah

[Chorus]
Cause I pay for all of this champagne
You drink a lot and you like it!
Spend a lot of thousands up in this damn thing
The least you can do is spend the night, bitch!
Aha, I'm just playing, unless you gonna do it, yeah!
Turn the lights on!

Yeah! I fuck with Shawty, cause she fuck with Shawties
I'm barley thirty and she touching forty
These simple bitches can't do nothing for me
But rolling my weed while I'm here recording.
And I don't need smoke, I just love the smell
And I love good head
I give it, I get it, I'm sure you can tell!
My conversation is lifted
Party about our existence
Answering all your questions
And the next second we're touching and kissing.
Young girl told me she love kissing
I told her, grow up!
I said, you better get a boneless dick
Before I blow up, hold up!

[Chorus]
Cause I pay for all of this champagne
You drink a lot and you like it!
Spend a lot of thousands up in this damn thing
The least you can do is spend the night, bitch!
Aha, I'm just playing, unless you gonna do it, yeah!
Turn the lights on!

Don't fuck with a nigga based upon what he got or what he don't
Fuck with a nigga based upon what you can learn from him
Or even what you can teach him!
Cause if I ain't teaching you shit, then I ain't learning shit!
Now what's the purpose of this whole situation?
Elevate your mind
And fuck that [?]
Can't leave that out!
Turn the lights on, yeah!
El Presidente!
Fair niggas feel me
Fair bitches feel me for real
