Song:   All a Dream
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Jumped up from sleep, soaking in sweat
Heart beating crazy from a dream I had
We was doing it up, cash flowing
I know you hear me nigga but you not knowing
Champagne bottles and hundreds flowing in the pool
So much poppin' the jacuzzi was full
Mad hoes for the bro
And everybody rolling up, we could all smoke
Pure molly, good golly that turned up the whole party, a few notches
It's all coming back now
Cocaine, buffets, mini mountains
Of that pretty white girl DJ played
All the right songs, we was all faded
Bottles on the house, half naked broads on the couch
Getting poked up, warming up, then I

[Chorus]
Woke up and now I'm still living it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and now I'm still getting it
It was all a dream
Woke up and now I'm still living it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and now I'm still getting it
It was all a dream

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
I had a dream I didn't even go get my Grammy
I was smoking and fucking bitches in Miami
I had a dream that Biggie told me that I was nice
Then I woke up and realized it was real life
4-5th on my hip, bottles pop
Weed in the air, these hating niggas still on my dick
I had a dream that my niggas came home
Celebrating life, then I woke up, my shit was blown
Tragic, I had a dream I had floor seats
In L.A. watching Bird and Magic
Exotic cars, money off shore
Good weed, my niggas with me on tour

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Coke on the scale, money for the bail
Looking is the rear view, feds on the tail
Used to mix E&amp;J with Ginger Ale
Sold crack when mom's drank pink champale
Now I'm in Anguilla on a ship that sails
Out the St. Maarten got them bricks in them mail
I don't play with the money cause the bread get stale
Rather sleep in a box 'fore I sit in a cell
Raising a wine glass, spliff in the air
I'm a gangsta, shoot me in the head if I tell
King pin, rap nigga dreams at twelve
Was it all a dream or could I see that well

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Havoc]
Last night watched TV but it watched me
Know what that mean, motherfucker fell asleep
Then I fell into a dream, it was so real
I was out in Vegas, blew about a half mil
Rode the strip, Rodeo we was club hoppin'
Finger poppin', had drugs droppin'
Hangover three, had bottles non-stoppin'
Top of her lungs [?]
In the Luxor cause the up-roar
Celebration time lift up your cups for
If it ain't us who the fuck you come for?
Jumped on the G5 back to the East Coast
Rich ass nigga still keep the heat close
Landed, bitches on deck to deepthroat
To scavenge for liquor and c-notes
They woke up to a bed full of freak shows

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
I had a dream that my first contract was a good one
When I get it I'ma let the whole hood come
Visualizing all the shit that could come
I did a lot of bad shit I'm the good son
Everything paid for we don't lease shit
My niggas still with me that's G-shit
Four chandeliers Master P shit
In the middle of the ocean, sea sick
Gorgeous, top of the Forbes list
No such as thing as I can't afford this
Pinky ring, sky dweller iced out Choca
Money talks so I spoke up, then I woke up

[Chorus]</pre>
