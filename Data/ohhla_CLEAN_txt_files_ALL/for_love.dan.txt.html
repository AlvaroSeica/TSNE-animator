[CHORUS: 2X]
Tell me wha gwan hyah, cah dem say
We cyant get along so wha di people say?
Is why we quarrelin' and not living for love?
Wha di people say?

Wha gwan? Tell me something, make me understand
You're not a travel bag bwoy, why you carry on?
Who told you the don? Yo, where you come from?
Your skin the same colour as mine bwoy, you need sun!
Maybe your hair is straighter but I wouldn't trade my
Dreadlocks for a plate of gold blocks and a LeSabre
Cuz see, I'm not a traitor, when referring to my people
I'm including the blacks and the whites, both are equal
The soil inhabits evil, our continent was accomplished
Through slavery and massacres of natives now impoverished
Yo man, don't test me, I know the ancestry
Two E's in Europe, both meaning 'Evil' for made centuries
Retaliation tempts me, could have the nation messy
Seeing others through the eyes of the Father's what prevents me
Cyant mix dog with cat but any humans can breed
The 100 metre dash is the only race we need! Yo!

[CHORUS]

W'happen to you bredren? How many tie you severin'?
Befriending those depending if them watch rabbi or reverend
Ain't no use in defending religion to this youth
Cuz superiority of beliefs is a mistruth
Who tell you say to whom and where you pray is what prepare your way
To heaven's gate or wherever you going once your shell decay
If day to day you cyant stay away from a state of hate
Claiming those of wayward faiths soon to face a heinous fate
Ain't no way to blind God's eye from your interior
The road to salvation isn't segregation, hear me nah?
Who cares if you go to a mosque, church or synagogue?
As long as the way that you're living ain't a sin to God
No disrespect but me nah care what you are
Too often religion is the reason for riots and war
You can call Him what you want but there's just one God you know
And I hope when Him call you, that it's safe for you to go! Yo!

[CHORUS]

Dear Heavenly Father, I don't know why I bother
Sometimes to write rhymes feeling I won't get no farther
Cuz all the while I'm arguing about finances
With my moms and my pops every time they're getting chances
How well can one expect to do when family's disrespecting you?
Reflected through the disdain for the music I'm connected to
"Accept it dude" is what I tell myself, am I wrong?
Cuz as long as I remember, me and pops ain't got along
I doubt there's even a reason to say it in this song
There's a line dividing my family that will never be gone
From when I born, I knew I was made to make music
But losing money doing it, to them, is not amusing
Abusing each other with words I know is no solution
Especially when family is a dying institution
Lord, I pray for guidance in this world full of hatred
Cuz I don't think we'll make it if we don't keep love sacred
Yo!
