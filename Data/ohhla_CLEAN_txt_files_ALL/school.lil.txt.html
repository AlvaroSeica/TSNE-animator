Typed by: IcyBlayze@hotmail.com

Yeah, all my tank doggs
Salute my squad ya'll
For Quan, you heard that Pavo
Alburn ya'll, now dance with this beat yo
All this money, eh gotta get it
Ya heard me?

I'm in the 2nd grade, used to rock face
Got my braids back just to show it just to let 'em roll
I know it's a payback, when I'm home or my way
Caps, lil brace used to stay back
Second grade is where the fun is at
We be gettin' stacks with ya'll and stan jack
Can't hear ya'll, holler back
Whoa, you wanna call us off, look here
Third graders got the player around the whole school year
This school lock down your third grade style
We be rollin' out ya'll in a single file
Meanwhile all the kids in my grade drink lemonade
They pay now holler if you hear me
One time for all my third grade compadres
Two times for all the girls that be gettin' it
Three times for all the dimes on the subway
Yeah stay lay when you talk please don't spray

Chorus
3rd grade got the school on lock
4th grade got the school on lock
5th grade got the school on lock
But you can't forget the 1st and the 6th grade don't stop
2nd grade got the school on lock
3rd grade got the school on lock
4th grade got the school on lock
But you can't forget the 1st and the 6th grade don't stop

I got to school lookin' cool, not a fool
Whoa, ya'll forget what 2nd graders do
Two smooth and a hard plan
Gen-yo-bwa, who who
That's the car, yes yes, ya'll
Feind Quan the bomb doing it, flippin' it
???? english are you feeling this
That means my lyrics is mad style
You can walk by all the girl be saying hi
Timmy the F-R-double E
Key way in, in the 2rd g-r-a-d-e
Whoa, who want it bad, do you want it bare
Badla got the horse in the saddle
Anywho
