[Intro: The Parliament Funkadelics]
Whooooo hoooo oooooo ooooooo-ooo-ohh-ohh-ohhhhhhhhh, huh!
Whooooo-hoooo oooooo ooooooo-ooo-ohhhhhh-heyyyy hoooahhooh

[George Clinton]
She was a freak, never missing a beat
Yeah, she was a freak, boy was it neat?
Yeah, not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she did the freak with me
She did the freak, never missing a beat
Yeah, she did the freak, boy was it neat?
Yeah, she was a freak, she girl is a freak
The girl never misses a beat, yeah yeah
But she was not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she did the freak with me
She did the jerk, it didn't work, no
She did the monkey, it wasn't funky no more
Chicken wasn't picking
But she was not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she did the freak with me
Yeah, she turns me on and on

[Chorus: The Parliament Funkadelics]
Whooooo hoooo oooooo ooooooo-ooo-ohh-ohh-ohhhhhhhhh, HUH!
Something about the music; ant got into my pants
Something about the music; got ant into my pants
Something about the music; ant got into my pants
Something about the music; got ant into my pants
Whooooo hoooo oooooo ooooooo-ooo-ohh-ohh-ohhhhhhhhh, HUH!
Whooooo-hoooo oooooo ooooooo-ooo-ohhhhhh-heyyyyhoooahhooh
Never missing a beat yeah, boy was it neat?
She turns me on and on

[Interlude: The Parliament Funkadelics]
(Round and Round the funk be) She's the freak of my desire
(Round and Round she goes) And when she dances she sets the world on fire
(Round and Round she goes) The little girl is the freak of the week
(Round and Round she goes) When she dance she gives me happy feet
(Round and Round she goes) She's the freak of my desire
She was a freak! UHH!

[Digital Underground]
She tried to work me, it didn't work 
See, cause Humpty Hump is about to go berserk
Yeah, she tried to jerk me; Shock G said no
So let me, let me floss, cause here we, here we go
Now, I be the big nose rapping man
Funking them up with the brother George cause I can 
The Money B is getting sweaty on the Knee Deep
The Freaky Deaky just wanna the freak with me (Freak with him)
It's the groove that Julie gave us
Slabbed you in the face with everlasting base
The groove bursts the words coming out my face
Rise, guess who's about to harmonize 
I got the big brown nose, I got the big brown nose 
I got the variety flows, we're putting work in
Shock G showed up, and everybody stops and stares
We're getting funky
And you can't never ever get away from the man with the colored hair
And Money B, so turn off the CD, cause Knee Deep will never ever go nowhere
So give us a pound, cause Digital Underground is out of here
Ha ha ha, yeah, like that, putting it down for Oakland town 

[Outro: George Clinton]
But she was not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she did the freak with me, yeah HUH!
And when she dances, she sets the world on fire
There's funky grooves it, moved me, moved me
Something about the music, something about the music
Moved me, moved me
Something about the music, something about the music</pre>
