You know what time it is nigga, 
and you know who the fuck this is
DANGER! DANGER! Get on the flo'!
The nigga right chea; sing it!

[Chorus]
Been so long (sing it!) Since, he's been on
So please (get on the flo'!)
Show me (the nigga right chea!)
What it is that you want to see

[Mystikal]
Go tell the DJ to put my shit on
I'm keepin you niggas and bitches in jump from the minute I get on
Takin they shirt off, showin they tattoos, 
screamin and hollerin and all
Got the gift to come up with it,
put it together, deliver it, make them feel it, bitch I been on!
Sharp! Like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad! Like that student in the principal's office
Put rappers in coffins, they dive like dolphins
I'm the damndest lyrical marvel you come across often
So watch yourself!
Or fuck around and get beside yourself, I know!
Go head though.. bounce them titties
shake that ass, drop that pussy, but stay in line hoe
Fuck a cain't, cuz you can can
Cocked up, head down, pussy poppin on a handstand
Leave that pussy smokin
If you gon' do somethin then bend over, and bust that pussy open

[Chorus] - 2X

[Mystikal]
My fuckin concert line around the corner
Parkin cars, niggas lookin for they bitch, nothing on her!
You lookin good momma - Why? Pshh, what's up homie?
Sirens, limousines, and the club owner - ya bitch you!
If you late, ain't no gettin in this bitch cuz it's fillin up
Inside packed from the floor to the ceilin up
The building ain't big enough!
I'm backstage bouncin adrenaline buildin up!
The pussy cutter, did I stutter?
The heart flooder, make your woman drawers melt like butter
Down like Nelly, I'm +Hype+ like "Belly"
The rhyme seller! Kick ass like Jim Kelly!
Stand up, round out, boot up and frown
Tell a nigga if he wanna try it then bitch come on down!
No sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's the shit then BITCH THAT'S WHAT IT IS!

[Chorus] - 2X

DANGER!
Talkin 'bout
DANGER!
Motherfucker look!
Get on the flo'!
The nigga right chea!
DANGER!
(Motherfucker) Watch your back!
DANGER!
(Look look) Nigga what! (look look)
Get on the flo'! 
The nigga right chea!
Get 'em up!!!

[Chorus] - 2X

DANGER!
DANGER!
GET ON THE FLO'!
THE NIGGA RIGHT CHEA!
SING IT!
DANGER!
DANGER!
GET ON THE FLO'!
THE NIGGA RIGHT CHEA!
HUH!
