Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
This that a-k mob shit
Ridin' round with a boss bitch
Moet sippin'
Faded off of that boss shit

[Verse 1: King Lil G]
Rollin' through the city
Its amazin', bang
Never gonna see me
With a basic, bitch
Never gave a fuck about a hater, no
Girl you wanna kick it
Better keep it, low
Low, low, low
My eyes so low
Throw money in the sky
Falling down slow-mo
Black hoodie on
With the hat to the back
South gate city
Put it back on the map
I rep it too hard
Like wicho's back
Keep the memory alive
Like wicho's back
Lookin' at my homies
Where the weed smoke at?
And I'm coming through your door
Like the repo man
Ski-mask on
Better tell me where the money at
Came up
Now tell me where the honey's at
Tattoo's on her face
My description
Garbage ass rappers
I put em on a hit list
All you pussy boys
Should hold hands together
While me &amp; my team
Get cash together
And I hope you muthafuckers
Stay mad forever
Better take a good look
You ain't at my level
Late night dinner
With italian broads
Calling bitches other names
Cause I'm handlin' broads
Mexican boy
Trying to make it to the big leagues
The words out
Now my ex-girl miss me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We ridin' through your city
Rollin' with the windows down
Smoking on that loud
Blowin' on a pound
[x2]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Young Drumma Boy]
I ride around in my new whip
Flexin' with my new bitch
My shoes white like cool whip
My goons keep that tool equipped
I walk around all cool &amp; shit
Bitches acting like who is this
D.b. from that mob click
And I'm always smokin' that bomb shit
Smokin' weed on the couch (couch)
She got a blunt in her mouth (mouth)
I got a p on my hat (hat)
I'm always reppin' my town (town)
Yo all my soldiers stay ready (ready)
They want that
So they cop that
And all my women look good
Small waist with a fat ass
They already know what I like
I only shoot I don't fight
I smoke out the wood pipe
And I stay blazin' all night
That's that a-k
That a-k mob life
Always keepin' it on sight
I break em off with that act right

[Chorus]

[Bridge x2]
