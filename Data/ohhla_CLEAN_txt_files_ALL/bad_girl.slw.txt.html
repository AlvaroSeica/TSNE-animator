Hook 1: Cousin Mario
Bad girl
You a bad girl
Bad girl
You a bad, girl
Bad girl
You a bad girl
Bad girl
You a bad, girl

[Cousin Mario]
Bad girl
You a bad girl
Bad girl
You a bad

[Slow Pain]
(Verse 1)
I don't skate
I don't roll
I hip and I hop
In my saucy El Camino, bass bangin', bend the block
With a bad girl (Bad girl)
My baby, she a bad girl
She so super fly, sexiest
In the whole world
My bad girl (Bad girl)
She burnin' up the club
Have her climbin' up the walls, stoppin' traffic in the malls
My bad girl (Bad girl)
She love me, so I love her back
Shotgun in a Cadillac
Tokin' on a candy sack
My bad girl (Bad girl)
A.K.A. Miss Universe
Hundred grand large
Stuffed in her Louie purse
My bad girl (Bad girl)
Takin' trips in the helicopter
My baby girl
Baby, she a showstopper

Repeat Hook 1

Hook 2: Slow Pain {Cousin Mario in background}
Give me one bad freak so I could spoil her (Spoil her) {Bad girl, you a bad girl}
One bad freak so I could her (Spoil her) {Bad girl, you a bad, girl}
Give me one bad freak so I could spoil her (Spoil her) {Bad girl, you a bad girl}
One bad freak so I could her (Spoil her) {Bad girl, you a bad}

(Verse 2)
Star Sister Nine
Baby, you so fine
Corona twistin' lime, 'Rrari stopped on a dame
Bad girl (Bad girl)
Mama, you so mean
V.I.P. on the team, G-string triple beam
Gagnsta lean in a spike
With a rag top
Mama, you so hot, make a player heart stop
Call the cops, bad girl
What you gon' do
When a pimp come for you, girl, I love them tatoos
Silver toe stilettos, superfreak from the ghetto
House me for life
For a Heavy Metal
You a bad girl (Bad girl)
I wanna put some bling on you
Bad girl (Bad girl)
I wanna put a ring on you (Ring on you)

Repeat Hook 1 &amp; 2

[Slow Pain]
Give me one bad freak so I could spoil her
One bad freak so I could her
Give me one bad freak so I could spoil her
One bad freak so I could her

[Verse 3: Big Dave]
Shorty got dark hair but that dark skin
Street scale, that girl's a ten
Sippin' so-called limon
Orange juice, with (???) gin
Bend your back
Ain't nothin' wrong
Hit the floor
Yeah, that's my song
Baby girl
What's goin' on
Pop that ass, like it's the bomb
Freaky thangs
Lacy thongs
Once again
You know it's on
Break your backs off Gwen Stefan'
Tippin' hard
That Parmesan
That spark whip
That dark tint
Pink champagne, that's player pimp
Montage black, (???)
I love the way, this bad girl tip
This poppin', doll, we stompin' on
Dame piece breezed, I'm real benign
Sixteen shots, I'm buzzin', dawg
With this bad ass girl I'm feelin' on
My bad girl (Bad girl)
Take it back, rewind
My bad girl (Bad girl)
Baby, you so fine

Repeat Hook 1

Bad girl
You a bad, girl</pre>
