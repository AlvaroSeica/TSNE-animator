[Muph]
I never used to have a temper, now it gets flared
I never knew fear but now I'm shit scared
Used to have an undercut, now I barely have any hair
Find it hard to give a fuck when I used to care
There is so much change
Seems strange when strange becomes plain
And even stranger when the stranger becomes known by their first name
Hurt and pain coincide with happiness and gain
If the ball and chain holds you back from your aims
It's time for a satisfied change

[BVA]
Take a second, reconsider bad decisions withered
Sometimes it's all that's remembered
Hey wait a second, I won't be cornered
I'll make me sweat, this ain't a sauna
Sorry I did not know this was your moment
Was slightly more suspicious
A dead ringer schooled a little cinder
Vicious tongues and lips form sentences to play
Endless games of twister with
Again when I thread it and defend it
Nah I don't know why I even mentioned it
They can run for now, but later we can draw at high noon
Ten paces, and run rings around 'em

[Chorus: BVA]
As time flies, as it does fall and rise
Pride itself, another lie won't help
You got decisions to make in the wake of yourself
You got decisions to make in the wake of yourself

[Muph]
Well I caught the wind, took off with a gust
I fought the sins now evil plagues my nuts
Forced from thin now check out this gut
The next to win but no need for a fuss
Put on my socks, lace up my shoes
Clean my teeth, now I'm watching the news
Sit on my arse, use a cushion or two
Have a shower before a night on the booze
Learn the basics before I choose to use
Clear my head so it's a little less confused
Procrastinate a little before I do a doo
Introduce myself then I can claim I met you
Add members to the group before they become a crew
Find the facts before I state what I knew
Try to understand or ignore your views
Abuse privileges, I'm seeing ugly images
Constrict or eat shit with a limitless attitude
Stick with it or continue to cruise
Fuse together or separate
You've got decisions to make in the wake of yourself

[BVA]
My thoughts are looking at the horizon
Surprising themselves with the new and current busted bubbles
Travelling the calm water, unpredicting prey
Waylay for a later day, expired
Cause too much talk made those ideas tired
Spontaneous passages inspired me to light fires
In landscapes with no oxygen
I fired by coasting to the new and improved neutral
Undiluted potent fluids, these words of fire resistance
Mood's manoeuvres for you to groove to
And leave the usual primitive, limited coincidences
For instance to ever feel that in an instance it could be over
Is this the end? Hate goodbyes
Sunsets forming allies, tie knots with loose ties

[Chorus: BVA] {X3}
