Song:   A Million Dollars
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I'm gone make a million and one dollars
And do it again
Just wait 'till tomorrow, we won't borrow ever again
Can't wait till the day we wake up, wake up, wake up
And we all gone be paid up, paid up, paid up
Just wait, wait

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm so tired for praying for this free shit
And being broke as some weak shit
But thank God for that Micky D's
One dollar double cheese
Or something nice I wouldn't eat shit
But there always was girls on my penile
And I fell victim to the vagina
But when it comes to the ass chase
No thank you rather run in the cash race
To the world knows Sean
The only thing getter better in time besides wine
Honestly better than all these asses
With no practice
Forreal just as is
I didn't have to go to school
I was better at this
Watch a nigga pull more strings than Lenny Kravitz
So I can say I have it
If not I wish I had it
I do it with a passion

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And we just started we nowhere near the outro
I'll tell y'all what I'm about though
High ends, high spending
We just trying to end life on a high note, soprano
And I was supposed to be on for a minute
Man I've been writing songs for a many
And you can ask Kanye, you can ask G-Ro, you can ask Don C
Hip hop why the hell you find a nigga like me?
Snotty nose lil' nigga
Used to tear up ice cream
Now I'm wearing ice cream with a chain on my shirt
Call that bitch a ice t
So tell me what it takes to go from sitting on porches
To sitting in porsches
Take in less fortunate
And turn it into a fortune
And make my mama proud that she didn't get that abortion

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm gone make a million, just wait 'till tomorrow [x5]

Do it again, we gone do it again, do it again...</pre>
