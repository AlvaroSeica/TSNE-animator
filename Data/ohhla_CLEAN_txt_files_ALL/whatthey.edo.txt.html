[ VERSE 1 ]
What they say, no play-play
The AK'll spray-spray for payday
Heard about your heyday, now you yellin mayday
And with the Money Team fightin Fabolous - Ray J
I'm cooked up, you look stuck
Look fucked, shook up
Hand out, lookin for a hook-up
I'll put you in check, push the rook up
Mate you, date you
Be faithful
Today too

(What they say)
This and that
This and that

(What they say)
Fuck your couch
Stop runnin your mouth

[ VERSE 2]
You know guys with bowties
Starin at your bitch with both eyes
Old guys with no ties
Lookin in the air with no skies
Give these hoes what a pimp advise when I improvise
I'm oversized
Motion in the ocean and the boat'll rise
Never over ass and thighs
Clap these rap guys after they baptized
From Boston to ( ? )
Look into a man eyes

[ VERSE 3 ]
Keep talkin, you gon' get hit
Take your license and work permit
I hurt and murk this shit, give you a damn fit
You and your man spittin, transmit unbranded
Leave you stranded single-handed, quick
Might get scratched, but I won't get bit
The game is rigged, and you will play
Pay now or pay later - but you will pay
I'm on the frontline, you on the frontline
Eat your ass for breakfast, don't make it till lunchtime
Here's a punchline, you couldn't end mine
I invest time while you spend time

[ VERSE 4 ]
I gave hostage the fortune
Fortune shot the hostages
Burn niggas, ostriches
A room full of sausages
Straight up how my posture is
I'ma show you motherfuckers what a monster is
Y'all too clean, the scene is too serene
And pristine, never a new team
Y'all knew the routine ( ? )
My newly cuisine is to eat your face off - Rudy Eugene</pre>
