Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: 3x]
Yayo
All I know is yayo, Every time she hit the block that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear the god that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco and you triggas know so

[CMG Snootie]
Aye yayo
Yea I just said yayo, taste just like candy cane but whiter then dat pure snow
And why you trying to play me and you know you selling wappo
When you wit the boss, then I got to say so, aye oh no, he hit licks like oh no
Counting all this mula paper you can call it mucho, cause I be rockin all this paper
Moving wit like macho, I be eatin nachos, cheese, guapo aye vato, holla at amigo
And he gone get them bricks and wrap them tighter then burritos, I let him know
I need it for the low and need it pronto, he gone ship them off (psh) torpedo

[Chorus: 2x]
Aye Yayo
All I know is yayo, Every time she hit the block that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear the god that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco and you triggas know so

[Yo Gotti]
Yayo
All I know is yayo
Trapping doing good, I'm serving junkies out the peep hole
Laws who knew
Serve you that's a know go
But since you triggas actors i might shoot like sum bureau
I got killas on my payroll, no sleep, I'm on no doors
On my paul wall stuff, I'm tipppin wit that .44
Mista thousand eight grams
Mista prices they to high for me
I love all my young triggas
I know they die for me
Bang
Bust five for me
Cocaine in my county
Kush truck that loud weed
I don't smoke
Blow pound for me
Yayo
Car white like mayo
Seat white like whip cream
Rims look like marshmallows
Yay

[Chorus: 2x]
Yayo
All I know is yayo, Every time she hit the block that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear the god that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco and you triggas know so </pre>
