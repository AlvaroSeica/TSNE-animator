Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Truth shattered, just taste it
Love give but love wasted
I put my trust in something
That turned out to be nothing

Heart I thought was gold
It was only made of stone
I believed everything
All the empty words you said
All the bankrupt promises
That was all you left me with

I thought your love
Was money in the bank yea
That's what I used to think yea
But it was nothing but a lie
I stupidly believed it
I thought it was the real shit
But it was counterfeit
Counterfeit, counterfeit
Nothing real
Yea, it was counterfeit, counterfeit
A bad exchanged deal

Deception, delusion
But I'm buying the illusion
Unless my pride and your kiss
And you were never worthy
It was 'pposed to be
Making love not make believe
Yea, you sure fooled me
All the empty words you said
All the bullshit promises
I wish we had never met

I thought your love
Was money in the bank yea
That's what I used to think yea
But it was nothing but a lie
I stupidly believed it
I thought it was the real shit
But it was counterfeit
Counterfeit, counterfeit
Nothing real
Yea, it was counterfeit, counterfeit

Was a bad dream
Was a bad situation
I won in love
God a bad imitation of your love

Was money in the bank yea
That's what I used to think yea
But it was nothing but a lie
I stupidly believed it (I stupidly believed it)
I thought it was the real shit (yes, I did)
But it was counterfeit
Counterfeit, counterfeit
Nothing real
Yea, it was counterfeit, counterfeit
A bad exchanged deal (A bad exchanged deal yea)

Counterfeit, counterfeit
Nothing real
Yea, it was counterfeit, counterfeit
A bad exchanged deal

Uh yea
It was just like a bad baby
Uh, we was counterfeit baby</pre>
