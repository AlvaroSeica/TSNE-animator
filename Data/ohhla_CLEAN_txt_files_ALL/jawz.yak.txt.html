[Intro: Hussein Fatal]
Yeah!
Murder game nigga
Hussein Fatal the Don
Killa Kadafi
(Ohhhh)

[Verse 1: Yaki Kadafi]
I'm on some shit to make your tummy's turn
Full clip's ready to pull quick
Fuck all that bullshit I ain't concerned
It's evident
I need dead President's the city slicker
Jerzey jigga
Feel my residence from we turn

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
Nineteen on the flight team this seat
Poppin early young life
We can get it peace
Shot the boy is noise
It's the shit
And my world Yaki
And my keep the shit

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
Trapped in these bars of crime
Droppin' picture my nine hittin' cowards up from there feet to they spine
In this game all rules apply
With no exception's all niggaz die living high
With no easy exits

[Verse 4: Hussein Fatal]
I'm stickin these niggaz souls to butter
Put em on coupe I was on have me bangin
Before I chose a colour
Leave your body over choking when this gat get to smoking
All you pussies from here to Hoboken
Leave niggaz jawz tight

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Let`s go, niggaz want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggaz in my click
That make they motherfuckers jawz tight (Let's get it on)
Now
Go, niggaz want to get it on let's fight (Let's get it on)
I got some niggaz in my click
That make they motherfuckers jawz tight (Let's get it on)

[Verse 5: Buckshot]
The impulse makes your body pulse beat off a beat per minute
As I get up in it
Construction no limit
Pin it like a cat in a dog fight
We gone get it on tonight
Block parties was a thing of the past
Motherfucker club hopping was suppose to last
But all I see, is niggaz by the mass
Fuck even bitches came to kick some ass
But don't keep the club close that ain't my fault
Take them back to a grain of salt
Take the ingedience ever since BDI went solo went solo

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Let`s go, niggaz want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggaz in my click
That make they motherfuckers jawz tight (Let's get it on)
Now
Go, niggaz want to get it on let's fight (Let's get it on)
I got some niggaz in my click
That make they motherfuckers jawz tight (Let's get it on)

[Verse 6: EDI]
Shut the fuck up
Your voice is hurting working my last nerve
Yo that's my word I'm about to take off
Break off a chunk of this trick ass chump
Who's knowing deep in his heart
He ain't wanting to see no funk
When he drunk
Yeah that nigga done got to him
Ran through him got him thinking he can ruin
Now he thinking I'm persuing
Who's in, the motherfucking house, Outlawz!
'97 we put some paw's on these motherfucker's jawz

[Verse 7: Tek]
Chi-Chi bong water bong
'Nough weed for everyone
Enter the class now we kill you with son
See bad boy with gun, who must just be fun
Or black youth them move about a three ton
Soldier from jungle never take back free shot's
But that did them aat when man go on them flaat

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Let`s go, niggaz want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggaz in my click
That make they motherfuckers jawz tight (Let's get it on)
Now
Go, niggaz want to get it on let's fight (Let's get it on)
I got some niggaz in my click
That make they motherfuckers jawz tight (Let's get it on)</pre>
