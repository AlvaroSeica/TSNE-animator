[Chorus]
I got the hood on my back, back
I got the city on my back, back
I got the game on my back, back
I got the world on my back, back
Everybody move back, back, back, back, back
Tell them haters move back, back, back, back

[Verse 1: Sha Stimuli]
I'm back like I never left
You might have never heard of me or we have never met
But that's fine, got my whole hood behind me so it looks like a rep a set
If I make it, they make it so I never rest
got the fire arms out like a sweatervest
and there's nothing that could stop me except for death
and even then I'll keep goin' on the internet
bragging that I'm still the best, music gives me endless breath
if I'm gone to Heaven or to Hell yo
I still hit the booth and I tell jokes
I stick to the script like I'm velcro
classic when I spaz I'm like shelltoes
talk in 3rd person like Elmo
Stimuli's everywhere, he be in the D
run thru the A catch him out in Philly with Free
or down in the H-town, or Miami with heat
you know BK's riding with me!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Try Lesly the gat bustin' I'm daring y'all
You can't touch me, my back husky from carrying y'all
Sitting with the flow so nigga you can't hate
I'm readjusted with Just, let's get a few things straight
Me and Stimuli energize like that bunny you don't want a run-in
'cause my gun will put an end to guys.
Even in Lebanon, ain't no freezing this shit
you think not, you must be higher than the starship enterprise
Realize I'm fresh off the streets of Mecca
Was rocking open-toe chanclettas and taking notes from the lectures
And bring it back to the block, share the wisdom with my boys
and when it's drama, I'm still on point with the weapons
suggestion, you shouldn't test him, I'm on my grind and
when it's crunch time, ain't nothing to bring the noise
call Gunna up, it ain't nothing to bring my boys

[Young Chris]
You know how the boys too, we spending money like Floyd too

THE REASON

[Chorus]
You the reason I get up in the morning huh
You the reason I get up in the morning huh
You hate me it makes me stronger when, you hate me it makes me stronger look
You the reason I get up in the morning huh
You the reason I get up in the morning huh
You hate me it makes me stronger when, you hate me it makes me
Just go harder, I go harder, I go harder

[Verse 3]
You hate me and I love you
You made me, I was a dumb fool
You saved me
I was chilling, I was slacking, I was lazy
I was silly, I was acting kinda crazy
like the world was waiting on me, so I gotta thank you for hating on me
Now I wake up in the morning with a passion
Any beat- spazzin
Any beef- smashin it
Who I be? Ask them
Stimuli's past is ahead of they future
I'm in first place stupid but I promise you I'm lasting
Superhero without the mask, I don't leap tall buildings I reach small children
I tell 'em not to stop, I show 'em how to pop
focus on the present, I'm the Present but I'm out the box
I'm the gift God gave
before we saw the haters and we waved
now we tellin' 'em this...

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Don't let nobody tell you what you can't do, won't do
Anything you ever had to handle or go through
Long as you are still here standing, hopeful
You can go from homeless to a mansion wit showrooms
I done had no rooms, made me keep pushin'
my girlfriend played me but the radio wouldn't.
Should I keep going? Thinkin' maybe I shouldn't
I multiplied the haters times the days that I put in
and it made me go harder, dis my own father
I just bogarded, put my whole heart in
You could do the same thing, once they see your chain swing
or they peep you rise up, you gon' see they eyes cut
They gon' try to knock you off your see-saw
I stopped takin' life for granted since I seen Saw
Sometimes movies motivate
It's hard to wait when you know you great
I go harder
