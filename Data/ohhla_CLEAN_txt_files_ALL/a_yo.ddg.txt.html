OK.. got some for me?

[San Quinn]
Yeah, yeah, listen to the story I'm about to tell
Another tale about that yayo
Little girl once innocent and sweet
14 introduced to the street
Started from weed, big smoke outs
before you could exhale, blunt in your mouth
Sham, Nay, blew you blew
now you need something else to do
A new high to try, a new place to go
introduced to the yay to the yo
House full of girls, old and young
playin it on the table takin one on ones
Use dollar bills just to snort the lines
you see the big girls do it so of course it's fine
Cocaine enforced on your mind
Now blow, then they blowin ya time
Let's go

Chorus: [Andre Nickatina]
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
[x2]

[San Quinn]
Chompin and compin kicks
Supplyin people with they fix
Where you fit?
Fillmore Street is where you sit
Don't go in the house till you move a zip
Worked a day and night shift
To stay awake, a nigga might sniff
not too much cuz you might slip
Instead of 28, you cookin 26
Keep a gat in the pack in the sock
take a couple of tubes, then its back to the block
Back to the service out the sack
experimentin with that salt, what about that crack, huh?
One try, another try without a doubt
papered out, always at the Powder house
Day time, night time, nigga part it out
couldn't been papered a power house

[Chorus 2X]

[San Quinn]
Like you and I, super high, like superfly
one more line, one more rhyme like Peruvian Fine
I can keep you down, and get you high
You like to blow? like Boston George
you want some more, for you and your whores?
I kick off wars, and get behind walls
and corporate doors, executive nose sore
Rich man, high, eight balls and quarters
they call me, placin they orders
Bring me across the border, buyin the case
before I'm sold, they take the case
Snortin habit, not with affordin
some use me, strictly out of boredom
I hooked people before man, I warned them
I took many people out before them
Doin my job, connected wit the mob
got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night

[Chorus 4X]

That's some good coke</pre>
