Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Quavo]
I swear I watch first forty-eight all the time
Wonder if I'm gone be on there

[Chorus: Quavo]
Get my migo on the phone
Yeah my migo one call away, he'll pull a
I ain't playing with these niggas
Pull the chopper start spraying on these niggas, pull a
Young niggas dying every night
Young niggas mama crying every night
Make sure call Rel
I swear to god I don't want to do it
But I might have to do it, about to do it

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Niggas tried to hit me for my my chain(No way)
Can't let you do it lil nigga
Cause I'm about to pull a
Now they asking me where is the pistol
If they find the pistol I'ma get a life sentence
Take me to population officer I'm dressing out
They had no evidence in the first forty-eight they let me out

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
What the fuck
Who that is outside, pulled in my driveway, it's really late)
They parked in, man I cannot see the tag
But I see a badge, 12, time to shake
Fuck, I rush out my backdoor
Trying grab all my cash flow
Jumping these fences don't know where to go
If I get caught, I get down on my knees and repent
But what's a case if they ain't got no evidence

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Offset]
I am no killer but nigga you pushed me
Pussy nigga thought a nigga was rookie, hit me for the cookies
It's okay, I'ma catch a nigga in the alley way(Catch his ass)
Hundred round under the K
Nigga feel my pain
I just caught a case
The police saying they knowing my name
They knowing the fame, and the chains
It's part of the game
You run in my trap, the chopper going to hit you harder than a train
The witness is who you going to blame
No Damion Wayne, I'm bringing the Major Payne

[Chorus]</pre>
