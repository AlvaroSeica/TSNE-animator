police say tony was drinking with a 19 year old friend
smoking marijuana &amp; listening to songs about suicide when he killed
himself. It's the 3rd fatal case of teenage russian roulette this year

original mad mad mad mad man natas (x4)

[Mastamind]
Can't let the belly of the beast chew me up
I'd rather give ya indigestion
do you believe in god is the question?
what the hell's going on?
I smell something wrong
they wishing for death for me hoping this wicketness don't last long
24/7 one more step away from heaven
in my journey through hell the devil got me bailing
fuck it catch me if you can kill me like a man
if I got my finger on the trigger ya life's in my hands
when I 1st came runnin' up on yo ass whut'd you think I would do to you?
boo mutha fucka let my voodoo run through you
if ya eyes are blind, 666 is the sign
stupid punks can't fuck with a mastamind

(chorus)

[T-N-T]
police &amp; preachers after me from state to state
fuck the world they find I fill it with nothing but hate
prosocute me and they will, jury my vision is blurry
how many died from the rhymes I've crucifed?
nigga It's alright if you die tonight
superman don't understand I'm the kryptonite
whether I'm dead or alive how will I survive
if you wanna meet god tell me who wanna die
nigga don't be scared just be prepared
once the bullets hit my dome I'll see you there
heaven or hell don't matter in the afterlife
cauze we all gonna die so no need to cry

(chorus)

[Esham]
I'm commin through It's the crew with the voodoo
fuck Jim Holly I don't give a fuck what you do
you punk bitch I'ma buck, buck ya body lay
and god don't fuck around this way
I'm comin' straight from the boondocks
I'm suicidal or am I homicidal with the glocks cocked?
I yell shells to the forehead
I scream blaz4me &amp; now 10 suicidal dead
I recommend some psychiatric
if ya comtemplating suicide I'm down for the murder ride
I still do what I feel too
and I'm all the way real bitch God's gonna kill you

(chorus)

"Welcome to the unpleasant world of NaTaS
 the Detroit based rap band who've invented thier own genre...suicidalism"

"It's basically a Satan in reverse, it is Satanic
 it is Satanic, I don't care how you spell it, It's Satanic"</pre>
