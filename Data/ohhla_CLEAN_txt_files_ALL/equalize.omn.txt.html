call my buddy up then I get on the bus
equalize, black hoodie, head straight to the back
bottoms up, down the hatch, bumpin' that eight track
see my man, diesel dan
yeah, what's up with the wax
I got that wild style, double xl in all black
full proof, take um' back to the roots and all that
stay true, hold your head, break thru and make due
I got the technique, hold that thought, it takes two
contrast, weak threads don't last
go get the cash
take it straight to the limits and when you see it give it gas
move fast, the shit be disappearing off of racks
especially when you got monster menno on the scratch

pay close attention, I'll take your brain to another dimension
hold it steady, steady, steady
inscense, afro picks, licorice sticks
old school 70's flicks, the funk era
uptown saturday night the birds flock
jive talk, chicken hawk, put the lip in your walk
who's, who
yuppies rub elbows and shoot pool
play social and snort cocaine, they're coo coo
small chain, all balls, no brain they want fame
tough talk, though the might rubbed off he got game
still fucked up from last night, I aint rapped tight
baby like, what's a matter with your act right
hide and go get it with some bitches and a flash light
first one looking for some titties and a cat fight
that's right, juice up the grey goose
there's a fire on the roof bitch, sound the alarm
that's right, juice up the grey goose
there's a fire on the roof, sound the alarm

pay close attention, I'll take your brain to another dimension
hold it steady, steady, steady

afterhours I'm bad to the bone, keepin' beats
knocking on casio tones
deliver mr mailman malone, straight through your dome
sound the alarm; I'm in your area code
bumping in your district, ballistic
ball barring snippet
I aint never heard nothing like this before, this shit is dope
what is it?
I got to have it, give me an overdose and I'm finished
me and a beat is like popeye and spinach
powerhouse, aint nobody else can fuck with
come get it, step the fuck up and get fitted
the fat, the big, the tall, even the midgets
you always see me on the grind handling business
I come correct, mic check, time to collect
I got a robot designed to hit the deck
press play, turn it up a notch, pour another shot
party don't stop, welcome to the grass hop
get the cash, this shit be disappearing off of racks
especially, when you got grasshopper on the scratch

pay close attention, I'll take your brain to another dimension
HOLD IT STEADY, STEADY, STEADY</pre>
