[Ryan Tedder]
I wish it could be like it used to
Used to
Used to

Chorus:
[Ryan Tedder] I wish it could be like it used to
              Used to
              Used to
[Baby Bash]   Baby, after all of that
              I don't think I'm coming back
[Ryan Tedder] Tell me what would you do
              You do
              You do
[Baby Bash]   Things ain't like it used to be
              Baby girl, you losin' me
[Ryan Tedder] I wish it could be like it used to
              Used to
              Used to
[Baby Bash]   Baby, after all of that
              I don't think I'm coming back
[Ryan Tedder] Tell me what would you do
              You do
              You do

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
Well, now
The thrill is long gone, the feelin' is all grown
Got me feeling uncomfortable, all in my own home
And your ringtone song deleted
From my phone
And damn, I used to love that song, when it came on
And no, this ain't, 'bout no new company
It's just time for you to do you, and me to do me
And you know (And you know)
And I know (I know)
That we don't belong together no more (No more)
And even though the memories still made me wanna believe
The facts, I gotta face 'em, it's over, it's history
Cause you know
We gotta breath, and I don't
Wanna deceive
A lie
Or get it, so baby, I gotta leave

Repeat Chorus

[Ryan Tedder]
The thrill is gone (The thrill is gone)
The thrill is gone (The thrill is gone)
The thrill is gone (The thrill is gone)
The thrill is gone (The thrill is gone)

Pre-Verse: Baby Bash
Well, now
I wish there was a way I could turn back the clock
When the lovin' was so hot
Good to the last drop
And I wish
There was a way I could
Rewind the time
Way
Before the tears and the years on the grind

(Verse 2)
And now, you lookin' at me
Crazy everytime you hear my phone ring
Used to get along, better back when we was homies
Used to keep it low-key
Now we fight in public
Argue about
Anything in every single subject
So now, I think it's
Better if we both just keep it movin'
I won't trip off you, and you don't trip off what I'm doin'
Cause baby, this ain't crackin' like it used to be
I think you just got a little used to me

Repeat Chorus

[Ryan Tedder]
The thrill is gone (The thrill is gone)
The thrill is gone (The thrill is gone)
The thrill is gone (The thrill is gone)
The thrill is gone (The thrill is gone)

Repeat Pre-Verse

Hook: Ryan Tedder
I
Don't wanna say it
But you
Know what I'm thinkin'
If we
Should be apart, now it's over like a holiday

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

[Ryan Tedder]
So where did it go (The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone)
Where did it go (The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone)
Where did it go (The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone)
No matter how we tried (The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone)
Just tryin' to find (The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone)
Just tryin' to find (The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone)
Just tryin' to find (The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone)
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone</pre>
