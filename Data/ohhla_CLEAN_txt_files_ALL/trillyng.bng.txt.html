Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I see these hoes ass niggaz talking shit about a nigga
Wanta make a nigga go and pull a bitch out a nigga
Problably take a nigga hoe but I don't fuck around with bitches
That gone fuck around with niggaz that be talking down on niggaz
And I ain't go do your feature, no I ain't go your song
You know that you don't fuck with me so leave that shit alone
I ain't been doing this for long but I'm already turning cold
Whatchu believe in doesn't matter in this game its about the dough
And thats some shit that I ain't down with
your niggaz trying to get high with your down bitch
And she already shot him down nigga gone quit
but he just tell her fuck that nigga he ain't got shit
And I ain't trippin play the game niggaz know I keep it playa
But don't be shaking my hand when you, I know you faking
And I know you niggaz waitin for me to fall off
You hating cuz I be the newest face around the south

[Chorus]
I see these hoes ass niggaz talking shit about a nigga
Wanta make a nigga go and pull a bithc out a nigga
Problably take a nigga hoe but I don't fuck around with bitches
That gone fuck around with niggaz that be talking down on niggaz
I'm just a trill young nigga man {*8X*}

[Verse 2]
I couldn't wait to meet these famous people
But now I feel like these people be the lamest people
They be fighting fo reality, and fightin reality
At showsand hoes wear gold with out a salary
I guess its all good every thing is all good
Private school niggaz get the pass to act all hood
Niggaz never seen or passed threw our hood
But they can act like it? Shit its all good
That mean alot to me probably not alot to you
I'm out here reppin for that p-i-m-p and dj screw
Like b-u-n b when that nigga was just like 22
You say you got mouths to feed? boy I got like 22
reckon I'm from texas you'll respect it don't you test it
We the one thats coming down gold grill benzs and lexus
Poring up, nigga whut, man I did this song because
Everything we created getting stripped awy from us
All these niggaz act like they gone go and call a play for us
And these industry people they trying to stay away from us
I ain't trippin on the millions man this shit was made fo us
I see my city down and I'm just trying to make a way for us

I'm just a trill young nigga man {*8X*}</pre>
