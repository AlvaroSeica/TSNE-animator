Down
A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise

Unmeasurable regrets
Unmeasurable regrets
Unmeasurable regrets
Unmeasurable regrets

It builds up, fills up
too much goes over board
what the fuck am I doing?
Oh lord pressure stored exploded, unloaded
what the fuck am I doing?
I had to, is really do, bad too
went cucu
gone mad dude
Grab at and stab fools
who knew??
Sad news
what the fuck am I doing?

I I I
Broke, it took some time
Slow poke
I finally gave way, went under deep
Don't float
No longer steering choosing
An autopilot cruising
Haywire, crash, virus
Pull your tongue out with pliers, CHRIS BENOIT!!

No longer steering, lost all control
Manipulation (manipulation), it won't let me go
The pain exploded (the pain exploded), the pressure burst (the pressure burst)
I drop the wheel (I drop the wheel)
Heading for the worst
Heading for the worst
Heading for the worst
Heading for the worst
Heading for the worst

Strobelight
Let go, hold tight
Wake up to this
Head to, is really too bad too
Close eyes?
You did this, this you
what the fuck am I doing?
You got issues
What happened, shit I'm stepping
All bloody myself I'm slapping
One day, all the sudden, I'll became too much, one day
Yes, finally will leash
what the fuck am I doing?
Unleash the beast
He gets my controller
what the fuck am I doing?
Took me over
Head to,
is really too bad, too
went cucu
Gone mad dude
Grab at and stab fools
who knew
sad news, I'm CHRIS BENOIT!!

No longer steering, lost all control
Manipulation (manipulation), it won't let me go
The pain exploded (the pain exploded), the pressure burst (the pressure burst)
I drop the wheel (I drop the wheel)
Heading for the worst
Heading for the worst
Heading for the worst
Heading for the worst
Heading for the worst

I can take you over, permanently
Because life is about pain
I'm the crippler, Chris Benoit!
And waa

A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise
A catastrophic demise

I'm heading for the worst
(a passion for the regrets)
(The crippler)
Heading for the worst
(a passion for the regrets)
(The crippler)
Heading for the worst
Heading for the worst
The crippler</pre>
