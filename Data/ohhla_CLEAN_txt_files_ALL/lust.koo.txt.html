[VALURE]
When I look into your eyes [x3]

[VALURE]
something about the way you look at me
keeps me wonderin, could this be my destiny
maybe take a chance at love again
claim you as my man, and spend eternity
wit you as my king, sharing every dream
with love and everything, hold onto me
don't ever leave me, no
keep me in your arms, don't let go

[CHORUS: GABRIELLE AND EDDIE B]
they say, when you find love
then hold and treasure it
don't let it slip away
could this be love
cause it feels right but I'm afraid it might
just be lust

[RON]
could this be lust or love that I feel for ya
cuz if it's not love tell you now what's up
I don't wanna lead you on but it's too late
my intentions were to love you let's conversate
on the real I feel lust got the best of me
and I ain't mean to break ya heart, girl
seriously, I'm not sure if this love but I'll stop frontin
it was a one night stand now we feelin sumtin
and if love take ova it'll be alright
it'll open up our eyes and give us insight
I wasn't planin to raise no family wit chu
but understand this is real I just met chu
plus we just left the club and you tipsy
you wanna come to my hotel and freak me
when you look into my eyes tell me wat chu see
you see a playa from the love and you want me

[CHORUS: GABRIELLE AND EDDIE B]

[EDDIE B AND VALURE]
there's a old sayin, if you can't get the one you love
love the one you're with, but I'm not positive
that this will be one hundred percent
I thought that you loved me, you made my heart believe
I believed it, too, but you expect more than I can do
but wat about the plans we made, why you gotta be this way??
I'm not sayin I'm not in love wit chu
but I'm not ready to commit so soon
but it wasn't too soon, to take wat you need
don't drown in fantasies
cheak reality, I gotta be a man for me

[CHORUS: GABRIELLE AND EDDIE B]</pre>
