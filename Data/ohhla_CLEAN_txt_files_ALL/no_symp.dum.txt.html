Song:   No Sympathy
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Queen sample w/ Dungeon Masta ad-libs]
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm, easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Mama, I just killed a man, put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life has just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

[Dungeon Masta]
Yes, I'm here, duke to handle my business
This ain't no laffy taffy shit, but you feel this
It's been a long time, I gotta release this
I constantly fight myself, good versus evil
Sometimes I blackout and lash out at the wrong people
And when I talk around these hideous duke, I'm lethal
Why you treat me, and dread that way
It's kinda sad I had to be that way, you piss me off
When you told me, please don't blow 'em away
Cuz it's way beyond fool, that niggas though I know are cool
Music as a tool, it's only therapy to me
I can't imagine what it's doing to you

[Chorus w/ ad-libs]
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm, easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Mama, I just killed a man, put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life has just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

[Dungeon Masta]
I was so hungry, ate this bitch named "Cake"
She had, damage control on the soul she take
She loved to make it shake and make my little heart break
And she don't play games when she masturbate
Man, listen, I love to create
And if I die, I hope she beat my dick at the wake
It might sound strange though, but I live strange, yo
I did in the park, I'm beggin' up the Range
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, man and ma, no suprise
I must solidify, the patience of price, dunka her dunkaness
I'm hard and strong, I don't give a fuck
I bend you over and be like 'bitch, what?'
Ma, chill and take a nappy sack
Suprise, I let the ho back, nah, I'm Dungeon, man
Ya'll shorties know it's not the takes
But these are the breaks

[Chorus]

[Dungeon Masta]
I'm no mystery, nigga I'm true
I am me, I am you
Cross me, that's a turning to peek-a-boo
You don't wanna see me act out, causing panic
End up making more souls drown like the Titanic
I'm sorta like depressive, duke, I'm mantic
Trust me, it won't hurt much, flesh feel weaker from the touch
It can do me no such, it reaps you now, and
Later on, go roll a dutch
Before the pain and the torture, head above water
Have you aggrivated, stressed out, wanna slaughter
Make me wanna see a body burn at the altar

[Chorus] </pre>
