you love the people that love you
you hear the music they move to
you give your all to the fall through
but you don't know you

you just got off work huh?
another night feel like the worst one
you didn't even count your tips yet
but you can tell it ain't no big step
I don't see why your so nice
the customers are all fucks and lowlifes
but don't fight you just keep the lip stiff
and get that money it's the weekend shift
but why they all gotta be freaks?
wish they would just eat and leave
and keep they eyes to them self
already insecure don't need any help
and you can blame the pride
that makes you hold your anger inside
but deep down you wanna curse 'em all
fuck off asshole jerkoff dirt ball

you love the people that love you
you hear the music they move to
you give your all to the fall through
but you don't know you

nah attitude check
you still show up you haven't quit yet
and even when you're meek and sweet
they still treat you like a piece of meat
outrageous each day
this clock tick tock and you still a waitress
tryin' to pay them student loans
and the lights and the phone and
the food and the home
and you ain't quite broke
but you couldn't afford
that place on your own
got a roommate to split the rent with
and now you never feel independant
and everything seem so hollow
'cause after work where that smile go
better bring it back tomorrow
now pick up the pace
and you might make bar close
perfect last call then some
flirtin' sexual tension
surfin' though them men
'cause they all searchin' for that bent one
or just one to bend
and you look like you could be my friend
with a smile like that I gotta flirt
girl you look like you just got off work

you love the people that love you
you hear the music they move to
you give your all to the fall through
but you don't know you</pre>
