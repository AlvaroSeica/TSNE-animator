[Chorus]
Can ya' bounce like me? (bounce like me)
Smoke my trees? (smoke my trees)
Throw dem' bows like me? (bows like me)
Break it down like me? (down like me) (2X)

[Miracle]
Now look here, big nuts, all talk, no game
Y'all lame, insane, Sands of Atlanta is runnin thangs
It's a kick in da game, memba cold top brotha?
Billy bad bad one bad mothafucka
I'ma beat ya quick, and nigga dig ya bitch
Den turn right around and what trick ya wiz
I'm gonna lick da hits, and any nigga dat chu' wit'
Spray ya whole clique, dem bullets they don't miss
You out the do' quick, the South is the shhh
Blunts they gettin hit, our bullets they don't miss
But the pistol-nigga quick to split, our thugs bust slugs
The competition wha, give it on up
M-I-R-A-C, now put the L on the E
Can't none of y'all people wha bounce like me

[Chorus]

[Da Robin]
Did y'all really think us girls can't get with this?
A broad with a son, that's some messed up shhh
Start rag toppin' and get jiggy with it
Throw yo' rod out shawty like you catchin' a fish
Bank head bounce I'ma turn around with it
And drop it down low watch me do a split to dis
Run me in wit' cha' rod I gotta finish the beat
And break it down to my knees, now you strainin to see
Uh-oh! Y'all jokers done messed up now
I'm in a zone and ain't no tellin when I'm gon' come out
I'm bumpin' hard so hard til' it's makin' me hot
I guess I'll stop and shake 'em off, cuz he ain't got what I got
I know he didn't just come and try to challenge me
I got alot of tricks OOOH just wait and see
I'ma bounce so hard, that's so easy to me
And drop these bows on that joker just for pickin wit me

[Chorus]

[Miracle]
I'm a king of da king, bling of da bling
Nine millimeter glock, infrafed beam
I'm doin' da team "Down South Bounce Team"
Ridin' wit' da mothafuckin' down south queen
Da return of da scene, straight dirty not clean
Fuckin with Da Robin den ya messin wit me
And you thought it would be hot, like nigga J.D.,
A.B., M.J. wha, Jigga Jay-Z
Hell naw dis me Miracle buck wild
From da south wit' da bounce and I aint Bow Wow uh

[Da Robin]
Oh.. no.. y'all really wanna throw these tight elbows?
You betta hit da flo' when I drop it down low
I'ma bounce so hard, make ya have a lil' show
Havin' some fun, can ya rag top to dis?
Bank head with it and do a split das it
Move back for a sec and let me handle my biz
Lil' shawty wanna see if I can bounce with him
Hold up, wait a minute you can't handle me cuz'
