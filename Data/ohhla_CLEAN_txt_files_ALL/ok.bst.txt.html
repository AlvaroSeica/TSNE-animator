Oah-kayyyyy~!

[MCA]
You talk and talk and you just can't stop
But when it comes to mine - it's a crock
What you say, is lackluster
I thrash emcees who try to bring a filibuster

[Ad-Rock]
Yeah, right, get off me
Tell me somethin new to start with thee
Said see you later, when you comin home?
It's a gift, it's a curse, it's a telephone

[Mike D]
Now let's start over with a nice clean slate
Please stop stressin with the hurry up wait
Heard you the first time, that sounds great
But back up out my space, okay?

(Yeah yeah, right right) OKAY!
Okay {*4X*}

[Mike D]
Got the pink ribbon, so pinky
My name's Mike D from New York City
I guess it's all, in the mind
What, I, leave, behind

[Ad-Rock]
Go to these schools like a nice mad professor
Then I show chagrin every word that you utter
Yes you said you are a big deal
But money calm down - for real~!

[MCA]
Got, to control my mind
Get this shit down rewind
What, is goin on in my head?
Was this guy on med?

(What is goin on in my head? Was that guy on meds?)
(What is goin on in my head? ... )

[repeat 3X]
What is goin on in my head? Was that guy on meds?

(What is goin on in my head?)

[Ad-Rock]
Now, I don't give a fuck who the hell you are
Please stop shoutin in your seminar
I never asked you for part of your day
So please stop shoutin and you'll feel okay

[MCA]
You loud like a {?} cop
Take a look and take a look and then stop
Took a minute get your mind unlocked
Get the rhythm when I do you the wop

[Mike D]
What's goin on in in my head?
And why has this guy gone all red?
Be kind, rewind
At least tell me what I disagreed
or just say what should I say
Hmmm... okay!

(Yeah yeah, right, right) OKAY!

Okay! {*4X*}</pre>
