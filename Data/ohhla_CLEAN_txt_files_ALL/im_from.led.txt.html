Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[DJ Khaled]
We the besssst..
I represent the hood..
I represent the ghetto..
I represent the people..
I represent YOU - LISTENNN!!!

[Chorus: Dre]
All the money in the world couldn't change me
No diamond rings or the fancy cars
Cause my niggaz in the hood woulda left me
holdin this because (I'm from the ghetto)
I'm from the ghetto (and I'm from the projects)
I'm from the projects
All over the world in every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fa sho' (I'm from the ghetto)
I'm from the ghetto (and I'm from the projects)
I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and that's fo' sho'

[The Game]
Ayo Cali.. walk with me..

Yeah, that's what got me here
The Chucks, the khaki suits, all the swap meet years
The six dollar socks, the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace, he taught me how to chop
That's why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the forty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones, the fake Jacob watch
A few reasons I drive the Bentley hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face, let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga y'all made my city bigger
Dog turn the TV off, got tired of watchin Jigga boss
So we told our moms we's lookin for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin for Nas
Project or the ghetto, ghetto and the projects
From Compton to being Dre's number one prospect, so

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Hahhh-HAHHH~! Yeah, uhh
They know, uhh

Yeah, uhh ain't no help there
Just food stamps, WIC checks and welfare
Every man goin for self there
And still might need to borrow your Medicade card for health care
Yeah, if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know each other, if not they related
You can get shot or get bladed
There's dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the 80's
Six months, five years is the usual cop out
Ninth, tenth grade is usually when niggaz dropout
Fights break out when you wired and start jokin
Lot of O.G.'s retired and started smokin
House party games of spade, sweet Kool-Aid
Loud music all night, 'til the boys in blue raid
So therefore, I could never be too paid
I know where I'm goin, and where I'm from'll get you laid, yeah

[Chorus]

[Trick Daddy]
Ha-hah... tell me this - how come
Black folks get a little dough and forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up, yes you ain't cool with us
We still support you though we ain't see you much
You ain't the first fool, it's cool with us
But while you're livin out your idle dreams
Remember how far you came'll help you keep them things (sho' nuff)
Now it's cool that your address changed
But I'm tryin to holla at my dog and your number ain't the same (DAMN!)
I guess new homies came with his fame (say what)
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the ups and downs in yo' career
A couple wives, few kids scattered here or there
When you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared, the ghetto still be here

[Chorus]

[DJ Khaled]

We represent the ghe-tto, the projects
Cool &amp; Dre on the track, we the best!</pre>
