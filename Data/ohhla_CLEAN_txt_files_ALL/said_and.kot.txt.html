Song:   Said and Done
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

When you look out at the setting sun, Another day has gone
Just remember how far you've come, When all is said and done

As time flies by, and you start to wonder why
Where, who, what, when, Know we will come together in the end
If you do your best to live life to the fullest
Just remember that you'll always be dodgin' bullets
It's a crazy road out there, but you can't be scared
To get behind the wheel and lead like a pioneer
I say this to the people, because you are my friends
Life's short, so like some bread and milk, soak it in
You'll never find what you're lookin' for if you go blind
Because your past moves forward, gotta skip rewind
Make the most of what you got and you gon' get more
Be positive, keep on knockin' on them doors
Keep on breakin' down the walls, Keep on tearin' down the boundaries
Release your inner peace and hear the sound of your heart beat

When you look out at the setting sun, And another day has gone
Just remember how far you've come, When all is said and done
Take the future, put the past away, 'Cause tomorrow there's a brighter day
It doesn't matter where you're from, When all is said and done

I know my evil ways have brought the rain, Have caused ya pain
When all is said and done
I know my evil ways have brought the rain, Have caused ya pain
When all is said and done

So when it's all over I say goodbye, To all of my girls and all of my guys
All of my fans I say it with pride, Thank you for makin' the time of my life
My partners in crime we write all the rhymes, My boys, fellas, the [?], the wife
The good, the bad, the life we bathe, The ups, the downs, I wanna say thanks
Put a smile on ya face, We all got paid
Kottonmouth Kings, ya'll know we'll never fade
Just like Tupac, God I pray, Know I said that song today
[?]
All the memories I have with the boys on the set
All the time that we spent makin' money, reppin' shit
Man, life don't get no better than this

When you look out at the setting sun, And another day has gone
Just remember how far you've come, When all is said and done
Take the future, put the past away, 'Cause tomorrow there's a brighter day
It doesn't matter where you're from, When all is said and done

I know my evil ways have brought the rain, Have caused ya pain
When all is said and done
I know my evil ways have brought the rain, Have caused ya pain
When all is said and done

What's up with all these bad times I'm seein' nowadays
I'm seein' all these good people ditch they good ways
The corner blocks stay full of struggle lookin' hard knocks
A vocal point reflectin' on the disconnected dots
Within the vision I can see a brighter, better road
A pavement newer, stronger, handlin' this larger load
A sign of life, a sign of livin', choice of how it goes
Stayin' in the moment, Will I wake? Nobody knows

When it's done, when we packed up and loaded out
The world is over and we splittin' into different routes
Headin' different ways, Hittin' on some super haze
Tellin' war stories, Reminiscin' bout the glory days
I'm still amazed that our letters still unfold
The legacy of a kingdom with it's super bowls
Us against the world, Underdog misfits
Don't underestimate the power of our bong hit, biotch

When you look out at the setting sun, And another day has gone
Just remember how far you've come, When all is said and done
Take the future, put the past away, 'Cause tomorrow there's a brighter day
It doesn't matter where you're from, When all is said and done

I know my evil ways have brought the rain, Have caused ya pain
When all is said and done
I know my evil ways have brought the rain, Have caused ya pain
When all is said and done

Life is a journey, my friends
So enjoy it while you're here
Tomorrow's never guaranteed
Be the peace, feel the love</pre>
