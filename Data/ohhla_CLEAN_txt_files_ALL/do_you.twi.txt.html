Blast off, home in the dark with heads off
Smoke squares five at a time and won't cough
I like graveyards and beatin' on the voodoo drum
And all you're worried about is where the fuck I'm from
Never existed
Grippin' my axe, double-fisted
And if you blinked you missed it
I'm Twiztid
No love
No hugs
Know 'dap
No friends
No light
Pitch black
All you ever see is the ground beneath me
Broken wings cursin' of my back, please release me
Livin' in hell every day with the vision
That's everybody up on the top but I'm missin'
Listen for the voice in my head to put an end
Or somebody please save my soul and be a friend
Do you really know what it's like to be me, hell naw
Cuz if you did, I wouldn't have to tell y'allDo you really know what it's 
like?
Like to be me!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
Like to see what I see!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
See another day!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
To be me!!!Chained like an animal andlocked in a cage
Situations and memories stored in my brain
Strung out
Shootin' venom make you bug out
Pay attention as I tell you what I'm all about
I'm a walking comic book to spit for mic screams
Livin' day to day is like a helium dream
I'm seldom seen
Walkin' with the dead is time consuming
You know my shit, you know what I'm doing
Now nigga if you took the time
To heed the message and this is more than a rhyme
Maybe you should hit rewind
Silence....is a deadly note
And we all hate the water that kept the boat afloat
It's a sick world
I hate every motherfuckin' body that I see
But I spread it all evenly
You made me how I am
Now you hate who I am
Good God, manDo you really know what it's like?
Like to be me!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
Like to see what I see!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
See another day!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
To be me!!!Take these...
...feelings away from me!!
Strip me of everything!!
See me for who I am
Take these...
....feelings away from me!!
I've shown you everything!!
Now you hate who I am!!
Take these...
...feelings away from me!!
Strip me of everything!!
See me for who I am!!
Take these...
...feelings away from me!!
I've shown you everything!!
Now you hate who I am!!Do you really know what it's like?
Like to be me!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
Like to see what I see!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
See another day!!!
Do you really know what it's like?
To be me!!!</pre>
