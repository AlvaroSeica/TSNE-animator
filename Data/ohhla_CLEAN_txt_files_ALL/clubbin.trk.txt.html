[Intro: Bless]
Yeah, Blessy Bless, uh, Cue Trax
Ruthless, and the man of the hour, yeah, Truck, let's go

[Chorus: Truck]
I just bought an outfit, to go clubbin' tonight
I got my hair all done, to go clubbin' tonight
A little money in my pocket, to go clubbin' tonight
Have fun, straight ballin, I'm clubbin' tonight

[Truck]
Wait ma, didn't I see ya'll up in Speed that night
We was all hanging out, smoking weed that night
We suppose to slide off, trying to creep that night
But your freak cock blocked, man, that ain't right
But that was then, and this is now, just hit me off
With the digits, boo, I see you around
Next stop Club Cheetah, I pulled up to the front
Already hear the music through the speaker
Oh shit, Chocolate, I been dying to beat her
Always kept her in mind, I knew I'd see her
It's a small world, 'hey, what's up baby girl?'
Outfit tight, hair done, I'm feeling those curls
Enough of small talk, ma, do what you wanna
We can bounce in the club and slide off in the corner
Truck is here, yes love, the mack is back
Drinks on me, I show you how I do in the Stat
Cat or boo, get ya dance on, you feeling this song?
Ass pumping out them jeans, curves killing them thongs
Just a right move, you know me, I'm playing it smooth
Ready to get my freak on, but I'm keeping my cool

[Chorus 2X]

[Truck]
This event right here, I'mma do decked out
All the eyes low, when you see me step out
The place is packed, you know every borough is there
Liquor and mad weed, man, everywhere
Everybody's doing it up, like giving a fuck
All types of liqs, drinks'll blast the cup
Shorty got me on the wall, backing that ass up
I mean, straight loose, I'm telling the truth
Back to back hits spinning in the DJ booth
Who me? I can't front, I did it up this summer
Keep another Spanish mami, up in Club Rhumba
Dancing with my pitbull, got her name and number
All gassed up, start doing the mamba
Club New York, Brooklyn Ave., S.O.B.'s
Hurry hurry, pop, the first five hundred free
I don't care, either one, yo, you must to leave

[Chorus 2X]

[Truck]
Let me find out, you telling 'em what place to go
And I went to Paladium, before I show
Can't forget the Roxie's and the Copacabana
Miami clubs and the ones in Atlanta
L.A., Chicago, Detroit and Texas
Tear the club up, wild out and get wreckless
It's about to go down, come boo, bring ya friend
You can party all night, doors open at 10
Can't wait til next weekend to do it again
I do it again, do it again...

[Hook 4X: Bless]
Get up, don't stop til the Truck stop
Get up, don't stop til your body rock

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
