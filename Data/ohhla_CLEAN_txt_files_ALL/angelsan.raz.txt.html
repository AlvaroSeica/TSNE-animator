[Intro: Hell Razah]
Yeah, Black Mar-Ket!
(Zzzzzzz)

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Aiyyo, it's good versus evil, I rep to the day of my death
From a baby since he gave me that breath
Hell Razah wit my nigga J-Kwest, nevertheless
We resurrect when the Word became flesh, don't forget
Throw it up, it's the Maccabee set, we not sleepin...
Cuz in the Vatican is angels and demons

[J-Kwest]
Who's President is this? I didn't vote for him
Welcome to the Novus Ordo Seclorum
Reference Orson Wells' "1984," lord; War Is Peace
Police go to war wit the streets, the real go to war wit the beast
While y'all sweatin gettin ya collars poppin
You can bet the Kwest stays knowledge droppin...
Open up ya wallets, take a look at them dollars you shoppin wit
Illuminati symbology on the lot of it!
The one-dollar spot's the most commonest bill on the continent
So why would you think, the markings that's on it ain't prominent?
Bush knocked down the Towers -- Osama didn't
Keepin us ignorant hominids, media conglomerates
Stay speakin that kinda shit, and leakin the drama kids
Just to keep ya thoughts off, the frequent abolishment
Of our Constitutional rights, I'm choosin to strike
You Lucifer-type 85'ers stay refusin to fight
You can catch a noose in the night... loose an' then tight
I'm usin a mic, to help Razah bring the Truth to the light
Demons in the White House, as I'm writin this right now
So if you're righteous better fight now, or get sniped out

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Aiyyo, it's good versus evil, I rep to the day of my death
From a baby since he gave me that breath
Hell Razah wit my nigga J-Kwest, nevertheless
We resurrect when the word became flesh, don't forget
Throw it up, It's the Maccabee set, we not sleepin...
Cuz in the Vatican is angels and demons</pre>
