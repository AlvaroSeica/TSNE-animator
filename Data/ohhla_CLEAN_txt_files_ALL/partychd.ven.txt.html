[Intro: J-Boo, (N-Tyce)]
Damn, It's 3:00
Gotta call Tyce to come pick me up
What up Tyce, Come to get me
(No doubt yall, Yo I'm think I'm ready to set it off)
Aight, I gotta talk to you about somethin aight
(Aight, Figure Champ ready to)
Yeah (So bring it on)

[Champ Diva]
I got a 9 to 5, And my pockets still tight

[Finesse]
That's word, We gotta do dirt to make shit right

[N-Tyce]
Ayo, If it aint illegal I can probably hang

[J-Boo]
Ayo we all in this together goin out with a bang

[Champ Diva]
Just like my nigga jigga, Ayo money aint a thing
And if I live to see tomorrow you'll remember my name

[Finesse]
Uhh, I want up out this piece
I want the jewels and the cars and the cash they claim
I aint tryna play games

[N-Tyce]
So what you got in mind yall, We aint got much time
But I'm tired bein home countin nickels and dimes

[J-Boo]
I got the guns and the keys where they stack the dough
I'ma map it out, But keep it on the down low

[Champ Diva]
Yeah, I got the masks and the gloves so we don't leave no trace

[Finesse]
And I'ma scope shit out to make sure shit's safe

[N-Tyce]
Everybody peep it, We gone keep this move a secret

[J-Boo]
Just follow the plan or we could end up in deep shit

[Chorus 2x: Deadly Venoms &amp; Ill Knob]
Party, Thuggin, Chedda, Forever

[Champ Diva]
Yo, Yo, Yo fam you need to get away
There go the money truck

[Finesse]
Tyce cut off the camera yo, We about to stick it up

[N-Tyce]
Yall makin me nervous, I admit I'm a little scared

[J-Boo]
Just get your shit together and you better be prepared

[Champ Diva]
Yo, Yo, Here goes nothin, Hit the floor I aint frontin
Bitch you outta luck and aint a damn thing funny

[Finesse]
Look lady don't make me do it, Bust a cap in your ass
I don't wanna hear you talkin, Just give me that cash

[N-Tyce]
I got big money bags, So heavy I can barely drag
We gone split the money when we back at the lab

[J-Boo]
Just keep it movin, I hear the sirens in the rear
Hit the switches, And put it in the fifth gear

[Chorus]

[Champ Diva]
Those police in a hurry

[Finesse]
Word, This is the most beatifulest thing in the world like Keith Murray

[N-Tyce]
Ohh this money make my vision blurry, We did our thing right

[J-Boo]
Robbed the bank, Got away, All in the same night

[Champ Diva]
Lets count this boo-coo, And keep it real with my Gs, True true

[Finesse]
Pourin crystal at the bar tonight getting niggas to dukes

[N-Tyce]
I need to meet a man too, So what you tryin to do

[J-Boo]
Hit the VIP spot and put my game down too

[Champ Diva]
It's all good in the hood, So yall showed us love

[Finesse]
Ohh, I'ma spark this dub back like we ownin the club

[N-Tyce]
Yeah I know that's right, We gettin it on tonight

[J-Boo]
Cause when it come to my crew you know we keep shits tight

[Chorus 4X]</pre>
