[Verse 1]
It's been a long time comin', but the time has arrived
for the Emperor to get live
Now that I'm back outside, all the suckers should hide
as I give rap fans somethin' they can bump in their rides
I wanna thank all'a y'all for still rockin' wit' 'Mal
Through the trials, tribulations, roadblocks and pitfalls
Breakin' down brick walls
The wait is over, I came here to show ya this is finally it, y'all
My chance at last to advance and pass the average cats
Ya done son, it's a rap - you're finished
I smash and grab, and stash the cash in plastic bags
with raps that have pizzazz - admit it

[Hook]
Would ya like it? UH!
Would ya knock it? UH!
If I put it out ya gonna cop it
Well it's here
A lot of emcee's is in trouble this year

[Verse 2]
Well it's the incredible Last Emp'
and my story is fresh
with the spirit of rap I'm possessed
I signed my first deal with Dr. Dre and moved to the West
Many speculate but I'mma put the rumours to rest
It wasn't like he couldn't understand my vocals
He didn't understand that I was anti-social
I didn't come here to hang out
I came here to put in work
and put motherfuckers under the dirt
So when I let it be known I was a battle rapper first
They didn't invite me to studio sessions and it hurt
But as bad as it felt, instead of sit on the shelf
and wait for somebody else, I reinvented myself
So whassup, Doc'? Now that the young boy grew
Would ya, finish the album we intended to do?
Show 'em there's no animosity between me and you
Throw The Last a couple'a tracks for album two

[Hook]
Now would ya like it? UH!
Would ya knock it? UH!
Now it's comin' out ya gonna cop it
Well it's here
A lotta emcee's is in trouble this year

[Verse 3]
Well I'm back and it's real
and this time I feel
like a different person
I put in work like a civil servant
Instead'a makin' songs without purpose
A brother like The Last Emperor has worked wit'
people in the game, like The Rza from Wu-Tang
Even the Music Man - Masta Ace
KRS-One and the Cocoa B's
The Beatminerz and Diamond D
Among others, talented sisters and brothers
but all dedicated hip-hop lovers
I gotta thank y'all, for bringin' me back
and helpin' me map a new plan of attack
Cop the album and throw it on
You know The Emp' got it goin' on
and I just thank y'all for holdin' on</pre>
