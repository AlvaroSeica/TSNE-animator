Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
My name is Krizz Kaliko
I'm totally alone out here
Well, if there's maybe just one of you left
If anybodies out there, anybody... please... help!

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
This music game here is in a state of emergency
All about currency, wackness reoccurring with urgency
Can't take it any more
Getting too old, mouth piece just too cold
It's getting me swole
I need to occupy hip-hop like it's my concubine
Cause I'm the nigga said that I gotta be the breaker, one
Tell Rittz to pull the trigger, all them niggas is done
If I miss then all the hits you can name under the sun
It's a trick and a list on how music is done
Tell man don't light me up
Tell the weed people light me up
CD don't hype me up
YouTube fans like me up
Too loose man, tighten up
Don't need to a freshman, I'm fresh no yes men
Rap 'til I can't breathe, let me catch my breath and
Industry needs epinephrine
Pass to what you see but I kept the reverend
Overseas but I rep midwestern
Krizz the bees knees so I guess the best, and
Me I can't see with any depth perception
MCs believe in me for question
It's for the S.O.S. to you
And oh, so 'F' you too when I won't step to you again
And I'm a hold my breath for you to stop these checks
Commin' in and these train wreck so many men
Try to save it try to stay connected resurrected
And they're expecting me to win
One of hip-hop's lost a few legends
I'm holding a grudge until the end

[Chorus:]
Hollering Mayday
Anybody can you hear me?
Yeah, me
Why do they mistreat us save us
Aimless bastards leave us shameless
By the time we're rich and famous
All our art will be forsaken
While you're waiting sides are taken
Nonsense they just keep on makin'
While are last breath we are taken
We don't want our heartbeats just to stop... stop...
Stop

[Verse 2: Rittz]
They know me on the internet
They don't wanna see me on a magazine cover
Half of these rap barrels never seen struggle
I've been fighting all my life but never Lebanese brother
Now I finally made it, everyone wanna see us struggle
Be subtle to these indusrties suckas, please
Fuck 'em I can barely afford to eat supper
Now you tellin me to word it out, but then
And over years we huslte
Makin music, and then people wanna eat a piece of it
Fuck you in the stab back, and ya wack rap
You suck, you suck, he sucks too
They rap, he's wack, she rap, freeze that
Skillin them, but you an MC, what's new
Just treat me, you should go to college
You could join the army, you could be a barber
You can be anything you wanna be, but not a rap artist
Your lyrics ain't cuttin it, you suckas just performers
Sorry to inform ya but you mad and wanna battle me
When I'm Mr. on one try to keep it calm, but
Every time I log on, the world starts
Seein but you never see the side of me we armored?
The dramas as worse as the rappers are
Fans say they try to be spectacular
The next minute we talkin bout how wack you are
It's no wonder why I always wanna smack someone
I need a ratchet, one, abracadabra, gone
Your shit is passed beyond bad it scratches crome
You need to practice some, I hear ya rap and yawn
That bullshit I heard you spit, you'll never have this one
Bullshit music fucked this game up
You should be embarassed, you should be ashamed of
Ever trying to rap I think it's time to change up
Go to Krizz Kaliko as it goes, hollerin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Horror flick, you should start with the sequel
Peephole, what I saw to deceive you
I'm the doctor that walks in and greets you
And serve you a smile like I'm all for the people
Meanwhile I'm the wrong one to speak to
To hell with a park all my dogs will delete you
The bars are illegal and all this is lethal
It's Conrad Murray when he walk in and greet you
I sharpen the needles, let it rewind
Badder flow, that'll mess up your mind
Got a Kaliko, got a Tech and a N9ne
And more weapons then everyone on this record combined
And that's strange
Cause I seem so nice, I seen your wife
No better yet again, I seen her twice
She needed flights, I got 'em when I seen the price
And let her roll with me like she had some green to dice
I know it's been a while since I sold at platinum too
A million and a million and-a-half of you
You tell me I'm the rapper you was rappin' to
I have you lookin' like a mummy when they rappin' you
Forget about my face with a mask of you
You better leave space like a NASA crew
I didn't have dollars, now I have a few
And now they look at my garage and tell me that's a zoo
Is that a Jaguar?
Of course it is, I purchased it because the corpse'll fit
And this trunk is bigger than the Porsche's is
They say I changed, well I call it metamorphosis
Fast lane, get the hell up outta my lane
Your brain will never be as quick as my brain
And the people will only kill ya for your timeframe
But I got a bullet that'll get within your mindframe

[Chorus]</pre>
