[Intro - Skillz - talking]
Uh, uh, the '09 Rap Up ('09 Rap Up)
Yeah, uh, check, yo, yo
I'm 'bout to put this thing in gear
'09's outta here
2010 is in the building, time for a new year (yep!)
Your boy Skillz's back on his grind
Let's run it back and recap 2009

[Verse 1 - Skillz]
D.C. starts off the conversation
'Cause we was in yo' town for the inauguration
We froze are asses off but it wasn't just me
That was a small price to pay to see history
Biggie's movie came out and got shine
Ne-Yo and Jim Jones got to scrappin up in Louis Vuitton
TVs went digital, the government's lame
Y'all bought them boxes, to me this shit still look the same
And I don't care about the fate of Jon and Kate
You feel sorry for anybody it should be the +Plus Eight+
Havin seven siblings can't be calm
But I'll take twenty of 'em before I take one Octomom
50 and Rick Ross, that's a new level of beefin
LeBron got dunked on and he ain't want us to see it
The news of Chris and Rihanna, broke in the street
T-Pain got on that golf cart and broke some teeth
Tiny and Toya got a show, that's crazy
Tiny you gonna get a second season? (yeah babe)
Run-D.M.C. they got they own street
And Jojo got caught tryin to spark that leaf
Man the game is bananas
For playin hip-hop, Me and Jazzy Jeff got kicked out of Kansas
Rick Ross shades was phony and fake
Enter a newcomer by the name of Drake
The industry got to get it in gear
'Cause it's bad when a mixtape is really the album of the year
And his vid' wasn't bad but I was mad at them breast I never had
(Uh, breast I never had, uh)
Eminem and Mariah, sounded bitter
And we all took to this new thing called Twitter
Where you can follow peeps just to see what they say
And if you wanna you can follow me @SkillzVA
Bernie Madoff, he was playin for keeps
Amber Rose became famous without havin to speak
Black Eyed Peas rolled deep (uh huh)
They blacked Perez Hilton's eye and made him pee in the middle of the street
Lil Wayne did it big
He said he wanted to F +Every Girl In The World+ and I think he did
Chris Brown, now that's my guy (uh huh)
But how he do an interview and all y'all notice is the bow tie?
The media went hard
Chris you want us to forget, just say what really happened in the car
Rihanna she kept quiet
Until she had an album to sell but we still ain't buy it (nope)
Mike Vick and A.I., back in action
And we was shocked by the loss of Mr. Michael Jackson
I never thought that star would fall to the ground
Mike was huge, the news shut the Internet down
Through your music, you'll live on my friend
And I know we'll never see a talent like you again
I gotta man up, 'cause even I was a fan of
"The Real Housewives of Atlanta"
I loved Kandi's song
But that Kim? (that's a dirty, low down monkey with a wig on)
+Tardy For The Party+ brought us some joy
But it never left the ground, just like the "Balloon Boy"
And to the parents, I'm gonna say "why lie?"
You named him Falcon but that ain't mean he can fly
Far as R&amp;B goes, Trey Songz's the guy
And I'm a grown man but I'm scared of Lady Gaga
Drake's knee kept sayin "hey bro, just sit"
And Kanye snatched the mic from Taylor Swift
Then the world couldn't stand him
(I'm, I'm really happy for you, I'm a let you finish, I'm a let you finish)
Man I think he planned that
The government, yeah they think they slick
What happened to "Cash And Clunkers? That shit came and went
"The Hangover", was funny as hell
And so are the rappers, who couldn't stay they ass out of jail
Jay-Z went on Oprah and hit number one
She gave out a lot of chicken but she ain't give him none
H1N1 is causin drama
And we was all shakin our heads at Lil Mama
Like, why was you on stage? Nobody gave you a cue
And with a head that big, you should have thought that through
Nicki Minaj gave female MCs some help
But if she signed your boobs, you should be ashamed of yourself
Whitney Houston got back to workin
And kids came up with this thing called jerkin
Where you take dance and rap and combine the two
News flash, come on son, that ain't nothin new
Nas and Kelis they couldn't get that thing back
Diddy holla at me if you want that ring back
Jamie he +Blamed It+ on the alcohol
And maybe that's what made J-Lo fall
Health care got passed and that's what's good
But the "Idiot Of The Year" is Tiger Woods (it's uh, it's Tiger)
Could you say fail?
Who else is named Tiger? Why would you leave your name on the voicemail?
He changed the game I suppose
It's nothin, who would thought he was puttin 18 holes?
T.I. came home after 7 months
I can't watch Mo'Nique's show 'cause she yell too much
And we mourned this year, I got to say
Every other day, somebody passed away
Mr. Magic, Roc Raida, my man Baatin
Darian (ah, yeah) and my friend AM
It was a very sad year, to say the least
so to everybody we lost, rest in peace
Uh, ya boy Skillz and I did it again
Welcomin y'all to two thousand and ten (*echo*)</pre>
