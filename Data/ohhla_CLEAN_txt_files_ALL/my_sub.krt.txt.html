[Chorus]
My sub, my sub, my sub
I put that on my sub, my sub, my sub
I put that on my sub, my sub, my sub
I put that on my sub, my sub, my sub
Yeah, let my trunk knock till the tape pop
My rims chop chop, while the bass drop
I let my trunk knock till the tape pop
My rims chop chop, while the bass drop

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Ok, I pull up and my partners ask me, Krizzle where your sub at?
Hey fuck them tweeters, they ain't beating, get yo' sub back
So I push my pedal to the metal to my cuz' house
He owe me money, fuck that bread, just set your sub out
I fly like jets, that candy wet, I'm finna fuck with hoes
EQ these settings in my Chevy till my trunk explode
Maybe I'm bumping, maybe I'm tripping, maybe I'm feeling good
Either way I'm quaking, shaking, waking up the folk in my neighborhood
Still hit the scene and whip, pour it up in my cup and sip
Never be where them white folk at cause them laws over there, they bound to trip
Lift it up in my thump-and-bump, saw a lame and I hit the trunk
Popped that shit like twice for real, niggas gon' feel my wheels of steel
Chopping these Vogues too, congrats when I roll through
Back to the backwoods where I ride clean like I'm supposed to
Forever whipping on, leather guts with plenty chrome
Knocking pictures down till I get home, I put that on my sub

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yo, now usually I don't disturb the peace
But I'ma wake you if you sleep, with that quake, that bass, that beat
Two miles per hour on creep, smoke make it hard to see
when I'm swanging down, I mean banging down, I don't be playing around with these freaks
I got a shake junt in my trunk, tell my DJ bring it back
Turn it up all the way to the max till that old school Chevy frame crack
My partner hit me up like he need a ride, but I can't hear him either
Say he got some bags and that's kinda sad cause only room in here for my speakers, and my beeper
But I'm riding out, pretend I don't know what he talking bout
Besides, he always hating when I'm bassing, telling me to turn it down
Out of line, that's out of bounds, bothering me when I'm riding round
So hell, I just wanna hit a low, shit, I just wanna shake the ground
Lay it down in the parking lot, turn it up outside the club
Can't tell if shawty really digging me, love to shake but she love the sub
You can say shit that get her wet and that be the best and I can dig it though
She vibrate, gyrate, I swear that's the reason I did it fo', when I can put that on my sub

[Chorus]
