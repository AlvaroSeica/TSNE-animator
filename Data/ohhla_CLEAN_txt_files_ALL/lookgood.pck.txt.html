Sexy back get love like limbo
Sucker free yeah I'm from frisco
Ice on my chain make ya girlfriend shiver

We so fresh but I'm so fly
Red bull for the wings thats all I drink

Dont hate me cause your girl like me
Tan lucky charms like different colored stones
Aint never fly on the rollin stones
Dont be stingy girl share that thonge

Skateboard straight thang back for ya main thing

[Chorus]
