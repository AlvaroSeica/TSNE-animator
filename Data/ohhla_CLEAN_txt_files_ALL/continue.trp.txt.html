Everyday you give your more to receive your less. (Why?)
I know it's hard to believe that mess. (So:)
When you get home and you feel depressed.(Just:)
Put on my tape and relieve the stress
And yo, cut the system let it bleed to death
Ain't nothing but your mission never leave your quest
In pole position - speed up lead the rest
They don't need to rest, they need to see we blessed
Yo, life is like a tide - shit come and it goes
Somebody had to cry cus somebody wanted it so
You have to fight to feel the harmony flow
but it's hard when the light's both so far and so close

[Bridge]
So when you fed up, and you tired of life
Keep your head up, you'll reach higher heights
Yo get up for the time is right
My people step up, and shine your light

[Chorus]
Cus all of the trouble we've been through
and all of the evil that men do
Makes us harder the struggle continues
Come on my sisters and brothers and sing too
Feel how the harmonies link you
while the struggle continues
We got so many things to
say and do now...

I know that life hurts. We all need a night nurse
I need to write words - I need the right words
To come across and make you feel my thirst
Without this so called freedom of speech I might burst
Transform the pain into a tight verse
Sendin' a shout out to all the freedom fighters
throughout the whole U 'n I verse
winning this struggle unless we die first
Yo when you hurt so much that it's hard to speak
and it hurts so much you can hardly breath
You wanna get up and fight but you far too weak
Feels like a too long night for your heart to beat
They wanna kiss and make up but talk is cheap
You'd like to dis 'em straight up cus you're scarred too deep
Don't be fooled, recognize the mark of the beast
Stay true to yourself and you'll be hard to beat

[Chorus]

I've seen so many different faces, different places
I've seen so many people strugglin' no matter the ages
From your grand dads grand dad to newborn babies
The answer that they givin' is all the same old phrases
I've seen the pain gone away with medication
and dirty syringes in dirty stair cases
I've seen lives slaughtered by dictators
Nowadays nothing is news cus nothing amazes
I've seen so much that is hard to write
but it seems that's just a part of life
and the people who make us apologize
is the same who make people starve tonight
And when your mind sees no difference between wrong or right
and your life sees no difference between dark or bright
and when not wakin' up is your only spark of light
Remember, we got a war to fight!

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

The struggle continues till it suddenly hits you
The biggest one is the struggle within you
Kill out the hate that is bubblin' in you
before your mental poverty ends you
Can you hear us...

[Chorus]</pre>
