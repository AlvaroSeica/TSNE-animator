[Milk]
I stay paid cause I does my job
Nickels who pave the way ride my log
Stunts and the blunts like food for the picking
Hold my nuts like it was a leg of chicken
Peers want to flex cause accounts are large
I get cash, they charge
Yeah, jel of the Milk cause the paper's always flowing
They think that they know but don't know what I'm knowing
Grammar gets broke cause I inch that thick
The name of this here is "Get Off My Log"
People want to be me, I don't give a damn
I am who I be (Who you be?) The Milkman

[BigV] Can't lift my jockstrap
[Milk] Get off my log!
[BigV] We ain't taking kickbacks
[Milk] Get off my log!
[BigV] Digging in the get packs
[Milk] Get off my log!
[BigV] Get off his thing and let his johnson swing

[Milk]
Check what I say, what I say is true
If you was the Milk you'd get sweat, too
See I'm kinda choice, kinda fat, kinda hittin'
People want to get the kind of shit I be gettin'
Hold your women, stunts get taken
If you think I'm joking, you're sadly mistaken
Props touch jocks like jocks are gold
More props get got by the more records sold
Stop jocking, my rocking stop jocking
Ooops, I'm knocking, when Milk's are dropping
Dairy, talking about flavors
People get excited when they hear of my behavior

[BigV] Can't lift my jockstrap
[Milk] Get off my log!
[BigV] We ain't taking kickbacks
[Milk] Get off my log!
[BigV] Digging in the get packs
[Milk] Get off my log!
[BigV] Get off his thing and let his johnson swing

[Milk]
Get off my log, get off my tip
I get stressed for the money I grip
Dough and fame gets my log loaded
Suckers get kickbacks, stabbers no dough
Written in a notebook for future use
Pumped in a leg twice with a deuce deuce
What, you still bit? My name ain't Herb
You'll get punched in the face and kicked to the curb
(Boo yaa!) So yeah, what's the point?
Get off that smoke, get off my joint
Get off my jewels, get off my back
Get off the gyp, get off my bozak!

[BigV] Can't lift my jockstrap
[Milk] Get off my log!
[BigV] We ain't taking kickbacks
[Milk] Get off my log!
[BigV] Digging in the get packs
[Milk] Get off my log!
[BigV] Get off his thing and let his johnson swing

[Milk]
Get off my log! Get off my log! Get off my jock!

[Big V]
Get off his thing and let the johnson swing!</pre>
