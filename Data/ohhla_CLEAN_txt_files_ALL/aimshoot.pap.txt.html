[Chorus: Sample from See Me Bright by Lloyd Banks] (Papoose)
Yayo got the whopper it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap, longer-longer than Pap {*Gunshot*}
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot
Yayo got the whopper it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap, longer-longer than Pap {*Gunshot*}
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot (Papoose, Pa-poose)

[Verse One: Papoose]
Straight out the big apple, it's Papoose and the Mobb
The "Apple" is nothin without me like Steve Jobs
At the dice game keep a mag on me
Why would I let another man ask bet me?!
I'm the best like Khaled, I bang if I should
A nigga gotta pay me if he throw a Ace in my Hood
So the drug dealers wet work, beat all the pushers
When you was still in your mom's crib eatin your boogers
I live the fast life that's why I stay in a hurry
Papoose be killin the mic like Dr. Murray
King of New York cop the caliber
My rap's off the wall like a 2011 calendar
Why everybody out of character?
They all mad at me I got 'em pissed, like a catheter
Champion I'm not your challenger
Stop amateurs like the sandman, Banks how we handle 'em?

[Chorus: Sample from See Me Bright by Lloyd Banks] (Havoc)
Yayo got the whopper it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap, longer-longer than Pap {*Gunshot*}
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot
Yayo got the whopper it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap, longer-longer than Pap {*Gunshot*}
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot


[Verse Two: Havoc](Sample from See Me Bright by Lloyd Banks)
I'm a carry the problem fixer I wanna argue wit' ya
One man arm militia nigga you a target misser
The wrath of God will hit ya, with a horror picture
Call this rap takeout, you know Mobb deliver
Too hard for the hardest nigga they fold like cardboard
Handle that now nigga ain't no encores
Cannon little heavy so it leave the arm sore
Y'all want war gave you what you starve for
All my shooters buy products of the worst recession 
Aim for the dome and laugh when they purchase vests'
'Cause that shit right there it is irrelevant
When niggas walk around here with shit to kill a elephant
So your next move better be your best move
Like a chess move or get your chest moved
'Cause when we come through you better have your guns too
'Cause all we do is (Aim shoot) All we do is (Aim shoot)  

[Chorus:Sample from See Me Bright by Lloyd Banks] 
Yayo got the whopper it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap, longer-longer than Pap {*Gunshot*}
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot
Yayo got the whopper it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap, longer-longer than Pap {*Gunshot*}
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot

[Verse Three: Prodigy]
Back from hell, sorry I left you 
Without no hard shit to step to
The drought is done, it's rain season
You can't stop my storm, you can't slow up my flow up nah (Uh Uh)
It's gonna pour, cats and dogs
Thunder and lightnin bolts knock the lights off
When I black out, make you miss me 
Like, nigga where you been at? Word!
'Bout tired of the soft shit, it gets borin
They look like punks or act like a woman
You need danger a little aggression 
You need excitement I put a little pressure
Just to, balance things out, we not the same
Some niggas is live, some niggas is lame
Some is real or some is fake 
You draw the line in the sand which side you claim?!

[Chorus: Sample from See Me Bright by Lloyd Banks] 
Yayo got the whopper it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap, longer-longer than Pap {*Gunshot*}
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot
Papoose aim shoot, Papoose aim shoot
Yayo got the whopper it spit longer than Papoose
Longer than Pap, longer-longer than Pap {*Gunshot*}
