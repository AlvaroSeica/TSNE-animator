It's not about a salary, it's all about reality ------&gt; KRS One

That's what they're yelling ------&gt; MC Ren

He'll just call you a low-life motherfucker, and talk about your funky ways ------&gt; Michel'le

[Eazy-E giving up testimony to the judge]
..but anyway, fuck all the shit you know
(*E cleared his throat*) you know cause uhh.. 
Most people in Compton don't give a fuck
Young niggaz, gangbangers..
Same fucking thing with the police
All we do is rap about it, you know..
You know, you know.. uhh.. you know..
Cause police like fucking with people
You know.. niggaz stop you.. 
Throw you on the ground and shit
You know.. put a gun to your head and shit
You know what I'm saying?
You know.. just fuck with you for no reason
Anyway.. I will fuck the police</pre>
