Uptown girl; she's been living in her uptown world

[J.R. Writer]
Uhh, shoutouts go to my (uptown girl)
And where she been? (She's been living in her uptown world)
Okay, okay, shoutouts go to my (uptown girl)
And where she been? (She's been living in her uptown world)
Okay, okay, shoutouts to all the (uptown girl)
Yessir~! (She's been living in her uptown world)
Okay, okay {*SPECTACULAR*}

You're lookin at New York's baddest baby girl I'm more than average
By the way I sport a carat y'all can say it's automatic
(Bling!) They say the baller's swaggered I don't play I'm tossin cabbage
(Cha-ching!) I say goodbye and hi, now the baby's stalker status
(Dang!) I got a stalker addict, gotta change my number boo
(For who?) For some lil' chickens I ain't give my number too
(Too!) I don't know what to do, they hound me profoundly
I hit 'em with the Ja Ja, ma get from 'round me (get from 'round me)
I got a downbeat, swagger off the roof
Who knows she got it, Manolo Blahnik, alligator boots (boots)
Swagger take a proof, ain't no duplicatin that
Lil' Guccis with the strap, she don't do the Baby Phat
No ma boobies where it's at, so I scooped her off the map
She will shoot you if you act up and come get zooted with a cat
Hat, swear to God she'll lose it for the mack
You get cute and run your trap, it's a wrap, shoutouts go to my
