Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Say something
nowadays I'm all ears screaming out over the speakers
breaking eggs with no fear
Made a name as a stranger that painted his paint on a mirror
stared straight into the eyes of it and faced it for years
Like ehhhhhhh
I feel I [?] a lot of principles and that [?] drinking problem
and melted pile of little girls
Like
at least I'm honest in my music
hard to be confident talking 'bout my losses ans bruises
But how I know it and never let it control me
exploded emotions out of my broken soul is important
So
move with it
I got a lotta time to brew in it 22 stitches dumb buck [?]
I got a itch in my system and it sticks to the rhythm [?]
With words I can touch the sky
and it's face open up wide let go with the power to fly away

Baby I'm gon' fly
I'm gonna fly away [x2]

That sursprised
Thank god for the music
I've been down and that's main reason I get up
And I don't need to try to be different because with words

I don't need to stand in the middle</pre>
