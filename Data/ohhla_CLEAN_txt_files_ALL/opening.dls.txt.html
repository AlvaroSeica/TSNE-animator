[Intro: Jacob 'Pop' Life]
Yo, I'm telling you man, we can do this man 
It'll be easy! Come on man, it ain't a prison 
It's a college dorm - an ALL-GIRLS college dorm
With two chicks in it who wanna give us some ass!
(What? Okay what bitch you wanna give me some...)

[Deen 'D' Witter]
Yeah, that's my man Jacob, we all call him Pop
For the longest we've been callin him Pop
Shit, I've never called P anything else but that
I heard he got the name from his addiction to poppin bubble wrap
Shoulda been 'cause he popped a LOTTA shit

(Man, you know what my moms would do if I let you 
drag me into this shit and we get caught doin it?)

[Pop]
That's my nigga D - short for Deen
Known each other since Grade 4 
and I've been cheatin off his homework since Grade 5
Yessir, best friends ever since then
I guess I'm the Yang to the nigga Yin 
'cause I always take chances while he's always playin it safe
Yeah, we're different
But the differences seem to compliment everything we do

[Deen]
Yo, Deen Whitter paw, major investment
The first of a litter like a Georgetown mascot
And you Toto stuck in a basket 
and momma made a man of bein stuck with a bastard

[Pop]
Ha~! Good Lord, I was alone in the womb
and so I came out too soon as a preemie
Just so you could see me
To be me is to be in the life of the jam
'Pop' Life y'all, that's who I am

[Deen]
Yessir, crown study it's that old boy grad (yea)
Got up out the hood, I want that dough boy bag
Me and P sign emerge and raise that index boss
Stay heavy like a brand new Chevy truck

[Pop]
What the fuck? I'm not a dreadlock Rasta
Just an asshole who crashed his brother's Mazda (while weeded!)
I proceeded to unjam the door
Limped to the drive-thru, ordered at number four

[Deen]
Drive through hop in parking lot practice
Thou spit the verses if he begat this

[Pop]
Lack this? Most do, so toast to two
who have nuff actions to back this

[Deen]
From the inner city blues to that cactus green
we're gonna stur a bit of milk until we make it cream

[Pop]
Full steam ahead we ahead of the curb

[Deen] (Pop) {both}
It's Deen Witter (Pop Life) {WHO WANT THE FIRST SERVE?}

[Pop]
Yeah, that shit is crazy! Whoo!
Yo-yo the cuts can go right here! (Yeah yeah, that'll be hot)
This fuckin thing has Jam-Master Jay type cuts and shit (True true)
And yo, we should get like about three girls to sing on this shit!

[Deen]
Why you always gotta get chicks like on it?

[Pop]
