Aight, let's go...

Yo U
What's your response to the MC's down there on the corner, man
Talkin about doin you somethin, man
What's up with that?

First of all, man
No MC in the world can get with this, gee

Yeah, I know that, but you know
Well, this guy is talkin that foolishness

I tell you what, gee
Yo, line em up

[ VERSE 1 ]
Turn on your radio, here we go again
It's time for the U to flow again
Mellow and smooth, blowin cool like a summer breeze
Just like leaves from the trees, you dumb MC's
Are gone with the wind
When I blow, you'll all end
So fasten your seatbelt, sit back and hold on
Brace yourself and prepare to get rolled on
And I'ma take it to your death
Watch you scream till your very last breath
I get vexed and explode like a bomb
Catchin more bodies than Vietnam
The mic's a fuse, and my brain is the dynamite
Ignitin when type MC's keep tryin to write
Rhymes like U
You can't swing it, you're doo-doo
Talkin a lotta stuff, but that's not enough
It takes action, and you ain't got enough
So when you come, bring a army
Even your mommy, and you still can't harm me
Cause fake MC's, enemies, and foes
I just smack em and watch em fall like dominos

(Back-slap ya all down like y'all were dominos)  --&gt; Slick Rick

[ VERSE 2 ]
Who's the smoothest, that's the question
If you don't know, then keep guessin
You're not sure? Well, here's a clue
It's one letter - the U
My technique and talent perplexes
While my rhyme flexes from here to Texas
Handsome and tall
You wanna battle? Come one, come all
I crush your world while your girlfriend swings low
Get with this? Yo, I don't think so
So take a step to the back
What, is you stupid, or is it crack?
My brain flows and grows like a embryo
Suckers are frontin, but they don't really know
What damagin a mic's about
1-2-3 strikes - you're out
What I recite will ignite like sulfur
Bite - you might catch a ulcer
So take this advice for your personal safety
Drop your mic and get the hell away from me
Cause enemies and foes
I just smack em and watch em fall like dominos

[ VERSE 3 ]
Nice and easy, yeah, that's how it ought to be
If it ain't smooth, it ain't raw to me
Give me a mellow beat and a bassline
Rhymes combined make you move your waistline
So listen as the rhyme is said
But you don't have to dance, just bop your head
Daddy U's as smooth as smooth can get
Bodies movin, it proves that the groove's a hit
A vocal tone don't get no crisper
Loud and clear even if I whisper
So give me a slow pace, beat with a low bass
And pass the mic and I ain't goin no place
I won't fatigue, take a pause, or retire
Energy flows to me from a microphone wire
Soon as it's plugged up, couples are hugged up
Touch the U? Boy, you must be drugged up
Cause fake MC's, enemies, and foes
I just smack em and watch em fall like dominos</pre>
