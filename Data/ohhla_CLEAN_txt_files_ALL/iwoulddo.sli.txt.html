Song:   I Would Do For You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I didn't mean to be so late
It's just that I got talking
Had a drink and smoke a couple of j's
Missed the bus and wound up walking

Thought I'd call to let you know
It was busy and I couldn't get through
I didn't mean to let you down
I know how much it hurts you

And I would do for you all you let me do
And all you have to do is ask me to
And all you have to say is steal me away
And I'll come running back again
And I'll come running back again

I don't know what came over me
Must have slipped my mind
I try to make it up to you
You sleep the past behind

I promise that I'll do my best
Change my wicked ways
Don't believe the things you hear
Or listen to things they say

'Cause I would do for you all you let me do
And all you have to do is ask me to
All you have to say is steal me away
And I'll come running back again
And I'll come running back again

If something's wrong then let me know
You swallow things inside
Your pretty eyes can memo
Your sadness you can't hide

Try to give me one more chance
To set the record straight
Meet me here tomorrow night
I promise that I won't be late

'Cause I would do for you all you let me do
And all you have to do is ask me to
And all you have to say is steal me away
And I'll come running back again

And I would do for you all you let me do
And all you have to do is ask me to
And all you have to say is steal me away
And I'll come running back again</pre>
