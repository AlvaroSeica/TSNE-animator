[Iron Mic]
Aiyo, shot up nigga? You gon' live, we popped up
From the driver side of the car, stay splidded wig
In fact you know who them niggas is, what the niggas did
We Ruthless, but I won't touch your kids
But I will shoot up your crib, send my goons to your lab
To gang bang and straight fuck your wiz
All my guns filled with hollow tips, so your vest is useless
Say goodbye to tomorrow, bitch
You wanna ride, I die before I snitch, hustle til I'm rich
I be damned if I starve in this bitch
I'm a product of the streets, I'm involved in this shit
You fatherless kids, will rob your revolved to spit
You fuck with me and get popped up, we call 'em hammers
Down south they call 'em choppers, to break ya ass proper
So if you see me with a gun and a mask
I advise you give up your cash, muthafucka

[Chorus 2X: Iron Mic]
You get popped up, don't fuck with me
You get popped up, don't fuck with me
You get shot up, don't fuck with me
No, don't fuck with me

[Apocalipps]
I put the 32 in your chest like Kevin McHale
I got a couple of loose rachets, but they not for sale
I need 'em, just in case shit get funky, ain't nothing nice
Don't think twice, you better lift that monkey
And you can get laid down for some dumb shit or bum bitch
Get popped over a pack, that money don't come quick
Get popped by a pig, just for pushing a nice whip
Driving while black, man, fuck your license
It's like triggernometry, all these guns fill our economy
Fuck a girlfriend, my gat's a wife and she's a dime to me
Don't try to be, like them actors in movies
You better know how to bust them .38's and them uzi's
Barrels get hot like jacuzzi's, oh my God, I love you tooly
Cuz these trigger fiends'll try to smoke that ass like whoolies
You got these slugs with no names, what's the key or the cause
Ain't no cause, the fact is, that that slug could be yours
Don't get popped up</pre>
