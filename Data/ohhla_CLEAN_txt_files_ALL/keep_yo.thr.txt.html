(Tim Smooth)
This hoe is small as a gnat off an elephant back
I'm tellin' ya that, BITCH, and what's a pebble of crack?
The fact stands as it is, we did, fuck a few times
On and on, but the broad, start tryin' to make me do lines
And I'm spooked, round them dopehead hoes
May molest 'em, but can't lay next to, no red nose
No old man was mentioned, but since you did, I know now
That our squabble's over, partna, go check ya hoe now
'Fore I, take this as violatin'
Cuz you makin' my ear hurt
Puttin' in sheer work, behind this bitch you peel dirt
That lil' skirt got'cha too hot, fahrenheit
Done burned your brain cells boy, that bitch ain't no Karyn White!
She ain't super, she super-stupid
It's in her genes to jump out of her jeans, her Mom used to do it
You is a fool for not knowin' she hoein'
This hoe actually done seen more fuck scenes than Janet Jacme
Ask me how I know?  I'ma show ya tape
That I made on that bitch 'fore that pussy got chaffed
Take the footage, the bitch and all her bastards
Jump in yo booty, hop in the BMW and just ride the fuck out
You could have her

Chorus (B.B. Gunn):

Nigga you could keep your bitch
Cuz I don't want her, I don't want her
This bitch ain't hittin' no shit
So I don't need her, I don't need her

(2x)

(Hasheem)
These bitches ain't no good, but these niggas a trip
They goin' all out for these hoes, even though they ain't bout shit
You think she's champ?  Look at them knobby knees, she be wearin'
Done spent up all your change on a frame of Donna Karan
Starin' at them titties when she step on the scene
Her smile is seen, but I know she bout that green, I got's to play to kick
Flip her my number
While you wonder who she smilin' at
Lil' girl next day I'm bout a half a mile and yards of cat
Phone calls everyday, while she say she lovin' me
Fantasies of when she rubbin' me
Dreams about when she suckin' me
Boy, I might look good with my dick inside
I bet she never gave you head, like she gave me in my ride
Cutie Pie got them thighs and I be massagin' 'em up
Me and my niggas in them guts, while you lovin' them sluts
That bitch no good, but that pussy hoe good
It feel so good, when I give her all this dick, send her home
And I'm gone nigga

Chorus

(Threat)
Now I was told a bitch ain't worth a dollar in dimes, by the figures players
First nigga to holler while loungin' is probably haters
Captain Savers they cater these hoes, follow the guidelines
Blind, but on the low this hoe, followin' time
It's spent, swallowin' nine inches of dick with no benefits
Limit to game, these niggas don't know what they up against
The beautiful change is meant to fuck with your jingles nigga
The bitch in my stable, best believe I'm seein' ten-figures
Stackin' gin, convential, niggas avoidin' the subject
I'm lookin' to be broke off proper, and open this bitch to the public
Fuck it, think nothin' of it
These hoes get dick like Butkus
Out the clutches best be my ducketts
Hoe I'm causin' a ruckus
Game is not to be touched, my spit is quick and legit
The bitch ain't makin' no chips or lickin' no dick
She ain't hittin' no shit, fa sho, she got'z to go
Out tha door partna, take that hoe
Man keep that bitch!
