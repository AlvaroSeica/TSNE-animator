[DJ Drama]
You see I been waitin, waitin on that time
Feel me if you been waitin on yours
That moment, is close

[Jeremih]
Tired of livin day to day, like everything is alright
Just waitin on that moment; waitin on my moment

[2 Chainz]
(2 Chainz~!) Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggaz fin' to earl
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don't let 'em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin' for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip lines!
I remember reminiscin in the kitchen like
I wonder when them Braves gon' win it
I wonder when them Falcons gon' get here, Pyrex vison
Made more than I ever made with DTP this year

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Tired of livin day to day like everything is alright
Every night just one thing on my mind
I'm just waitin on that moment, waitin on my moment
You say that you got that hot shit, hell nah
Next time that's mine
But as long as I stay hustlin I'm gon' shine
I'm just waitin on that moment, waitin on my moment

[Meek Mill]
Just waiting on my moment, bad hoes I'm showin it
Time came and I owned it just like Lebron James and start ballin
When I touched the rock and I cracked the block
When I pulled up in that muscle drop
With that roof off and my shoes off
on you bitch niggaz, RuPaul
Real nigga in my hood, who e'rybody gon' root for
They see my come from that bottom, where e'rubody get bodied
They told me get 'em I got 'em; now I'm here nigga like yeah nigga
Just Rolls Royce and Bugattis, and M4s this year nigga
If I don't grind, I don't shine, if I don't shine then I don't eat
Won't eat, then I'ma starve, and if I'ma starve I pull heat
on all y'all bitch-ass niggaz, all y'all rich-ass niggaz
Cause if I don't make no money, nigga, I'm gon' take yo' money, nigga

[Chorus]

[Jeremih]
Since life ain't promised tomorrow
Live it up live it up live it up
I'd be a fool to come this far and
give it up give it up give it up
I won't, I won't, give it up give it up give up
Until I have it all, yeah

[Chorus]</pre>
