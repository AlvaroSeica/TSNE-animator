[Fat Joe]
Coca UH~!
I'm in the greatest shape of my life

[Fat Joe]
Just when you thought it was, safe to turn the corner I
had to run up on him like brrap! Now he's gone
Who you think you kidding you, I will just get rid of you
Leave you in that critical it's Joey Crack the don
You don't even know me, got hundred homies and brodies
with chromies that run up on me, blow your brains on your mom
I am a professional, I will cut your testicles
Stuff 'em in your mouth where them lil' shits belong!

[Chorus: Fat Joe] + (Opera Steve)
(We want war, we love war)
(We need war, we want war)
Just when you thought it was, safe to turn the corner I
had to run up on him like brrap! Now he's gone
Just when you thought it was, safe to turn the corner I
had to run up on him like brrap! Now he's gone

[Fat Joe]
Crack man, Crack man, playin with the gat then
Hear that? Brrrrrrap-ra-tat-tat-tat like the song
Taurus, ragin bull about the size of my arm
See the size of the charm make your wife leave your arm
That's right, I fight, I done been in brawls
I done did some things that made some killers shit they drawers
I done been on boats in Columbia shippin raw
Ay I done ripped up plenty of stages with Biggie Smalls
Oh shit, wait a minute, I done did it all
Poor Righteous Teacher, I'm featured on Final Call
Asalaam alaikum and, yes yes y'all
And Pun already told you that we ready for war
Crack playin hit mayne, blood stains on the wall
Shit mayne, his brains, your remains on the floor
I am a professional, I will cut your testicles
Stuff 'em in your mouth where them lil' shits belong!

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
