[Chorus: Shabazz the Disciple]
A real nigga don't believe that sound, the nigga's grown
Bitches don't play that, no....

[Shabazz the Disciple]
The youth done blinded by stardom on television
Don't let the media tell 'em lies to ya vision
Look around in ya hood, you see your people struggling
We all just trying to get by, you see some niggas juggling
Another nigga came home, another teen addicted
Another raid, man, another family evicted
Another prison visit, oh, it's another wake
Another in the juvi max, another seen the gates
On TV, they glorify being hood
When that ass roll up north, you gon' see it ain't all good
And blacks losers, gang meetings in the bathrooms
While white kids got laptops in they classrooms
They handcuffing eight year old black students
While six year olds spend all day under the influence
Ten year olds run the streets til the AM
Your pops is gone, niggas sprayed it cuz the ain't there
Your moms just got out the pen again for tricking
She fucking with the meanest men, that virus bout to kick in
They spoon them videos, the ignorance is glorified
You go outside, all you see is life horified
And spit with Biggie, only made it East-West related
Pac was a prophet man, and was assassinated
And I don't believe Bin Laden hit the Towers
Yo, why the fuck they ain't find him yet with all this power?
That plan was written on the back of 20 dollars
And agents man made by they scientists and stylists
Arrest the President, he's the biggest drug trafficker
When there's a new disease, they always saying it's from Africa
I seen alotta cocaine on them triple beams
I seen alotta niggas die chasing hood dreams
I seen alotta guns, money machines
Half of my generations in state green for chasing hood dreams
The same shit was going on when my pops was thugging
Now shit is in my veins, and my pockets buzzing
Over a gold chain, seen my man Popa's cousin
I love the gold, little nigga, man, cops is coming</pre>
