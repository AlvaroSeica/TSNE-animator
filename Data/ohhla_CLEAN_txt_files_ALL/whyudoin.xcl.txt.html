(Brother J)
Yea, X-Clan
Mil-Cipher in effect get down
How we doin that, Oh!

Bean One, Brother J, X-Clan, yea exclusive
return from Mecca let's get it together, Oh
Sugar Shaft we got to keep it movin
Big Soul we got to keep it movin
X-Clan we got to keep it movin
in the struggle yo, bust

I'm an example of street knowledge and conscious livin
my technique's so refined they gave my mike a blue ribbon
I galloped out the rap race of stressin and trippin
flipped stealth from spotlights to master shadow living
I flipped through the channels do a little CNN'n
they straight genocide upon indigenous livin
and you just get a snippet of the real real to realness (bottom line)
no research (yea yea) no knowledge (come on)
it don't take a big four year college
to learn what it takes to put paper in your wallet
common sense yo act like you've got it
act like they making glass dicks for every human being on the market (whoooo)
word to Horace with no blaspheme
but I swing like the hawk to protect the Earth's cream
in the Matrix dream knowledge of self must awaken
the stolen legacy is the one they keep takin

(Chorus)
Aids in the Alkebulan terrorist attacks
fear for breakfast keeps kids on Prozac
(It gets worst)
trying to drown us black why you doin that?
trying to hold us back why you doin that?

Schools like prisons and every Special Ed is packed
children learn the ring tones before their alphabetic basics that's whack
dumbing out our future why you doin that?
pissin on our culture why you doin that?

(Brother J)
Tainted information
I wanted segregation between us and our rights between us and one nation
we've been divided since Nimrod at Babel
no longer building like Solomon it's like we're just standing still in the gravel
we're so confused in our travel
we fought for freedom of speech then silenced cause we don't spit the tattle (uh huh)
so many corporate monopoly chains
buying leases to brainwaves through sound waves
and tell you from your getup through your workday
get that ching-ching (hustle) and money aint a thing (uh huh)
the repetition of negative data 
sets us back two steps in the ways of the evolutional ladder
savage on a platter, savage in a rapper tells the tale of the war within (we never factored)
it would guide our youth, and kill our street troops
time to break the cycle and return to our roots

(Chorus)
Aids in the the Quebulon terrorist attacks
fear for breakfast keeps kids on Prozac
(it gets worst)
trying to drown us black why you doin that?
trying to hold us back why you doin that?

Schools like prisons and every Special Ed is packed
children learn the ring tones before their alphabetic basics that's whack
dumbing out our future why you doin that?
pissin on our culture why you doin that?

Doin that, doin that, doin that</pre>
