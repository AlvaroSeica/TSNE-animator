You please let's get--

[Samuel Christian]
If ignorant is everything that we don't know
And we can only obtain wisdom as we grow
Then why we actin like we just got off the boat
If that's how you man can preceed we'll let you go
With so many mistakes to ignorant to know
That it was you behold to row my own boat row
That hard to stat, that I and pride will kill it slow
So when your children our name I'll let it go

Chorus 2X:
Cuz I come to believe that ain't nuthin in this world like you
Ain't nuthin in this world like you
Ain't nuthin in this world like you

[Samuel Christian]
Cuz I come to believe that if you build it I am movin way too slow
Then just demand am I one of your own that's all
Ain't scared of it, will take the hit if that's the road
Cuz just for you I clinch my fist to hold the gold
And if that's enough open my eyes to show me the way
Like you did Moses two tablets ago
And when I'm done I will return to let him know
The battles over now get ready for the vow

Chorus 2X

Cuz I come to believe that--

[Mos Def]
It's cherokee the dark ebony the fly heavenly
Make me forget my federal treasury
Just to be inside the strike zone of your energy
Love blessedly, come next to me, messure me with memory
I fiend terribly but I still I know you there for me
This thing is scaring me for real, uncruel like what the deal
Your love is wild like mass appeal, 
I'm just gon have to man and have to deal
With how I feel and really really keep it real
And realize you equalize the R E ality, so casually
No fantasy, challenge me to be the man I have to be
For those who rule the man and woman after me
No time for movin backwards my passion flee fantastically
Still I know this task to me to realize my mastery
And set inside my fantasy 
leave everything that all your love is askin me
From first to the last with me, I pray you keep your hands on me
And let the hear your tablets be, written on behalf of me

[Samuel Christian]
Here in the ghetto with my lady love
Nadia she keep me down to the city life, Nadia Nadia
Cuz I met her the ghetto, with my lady love
Nadia keep me bound to the city life, Nadia Nadia
Cuz I met her in the ghetto
God is in the ghetto
Love is in the ghetto
In the ghetto
Truth is the ghetto
Power in the ghetto</pre>
