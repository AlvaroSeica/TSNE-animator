Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Power and greed?
That's not for me
I'd rather walk my own paths
I'd rather plant my own seeds
So a plant is a threat to the American dream?
I guess the land of the free ain't what it seems
But for those that are free, say like you and me
understand the meaning of true liberty
For those who don't, here's what I say
you've been tricked and fooled in every way
Riddled by the system of ours
driven by greed and gas guzzling cars
So don't confront, and don't obey
Live your life stoning, and find your own way </pre>
