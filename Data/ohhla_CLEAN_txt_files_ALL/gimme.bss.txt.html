Song:   Gimme My Money 
Typed by: TwstdFlava@aol.com

Always schemin' to make real my dreamin'
Oh, since my conscience ???
Run and hide, live a lie

Never cry, I got devil eyes
All I despise, quick to criticize
I want it all and I want it now
Solitude and sin
Calm my nerves with gin
Sleep, wake up, and do it all again

And damn all else, for the wealth
I'll be detrimental to myself
Mental justification, I got no patience
I want to give, so I guess it's time for takin'

1 -	If we're livin' in the land of milk and honey
	Then gimme, gimme, gimme my money, money, money
	And don't blame me cuz ain't a damn thing funny
	And gimme, gimme, gimme my money, money, money

Repeat 1

Rapping:

I caught greed, visions of diamonds in my sleep
Blue streak, everything else lookin' bleak
Slither, slidin', ridin', hidin' from correction
Got ya detection, get in it like direction
Snake persona
So much heat around me, feels like a sauna
I wanna have the kinda loot it takes to bone Madonna
I get the discount, five finger always
Eyes glazed, hide from the sun rays
Decept a con, you won't see me comin' like the Clinton scandal
Can't hold a candle to what I've handled
I live beneath the earth's crust, next to the mantle
Feed my addiction, from other people's property
I have no choice in this democracy
Thieve, deceive, violate, accumulate, put all in real estate
Spend the rest on dope and vegetate
Cuz I'm already fuckin' jive and the maid
I want the goddamn cake

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Singing:

Thievery has never been a novelty
Nothin' glamorous about poverty
Skinny guy licks his lips at the bakery
Frivolous ways make the poor man angry

And life's a battle, and life's a bitch
And there ain't one honest man that's rich
He gotta catch, he gotta hitch
The pretty package, the big-top with a sales pitch

And I fall for it everytime
And still that mutha-fucka wants mine
This whole system was made so I can make it better
I want to give, so I guess it's time for takin'

Repeat 1 to fade</pre>
