[Intro: Yelawolf]
Yeah yeah
This ain't for the good girls gone bad
This one's for the bad girls tryin to go good
Yeah

[Chorus: Poo Bear] + (Yelawolf)
How could someone like me so bad get such a good girl?
Such a good girl (yeah) you're a good girl
And I know that I don't treat you like I should, girl (I should, girl)
Like I could, girl (I could, girl) like my good girl (my good, girl)
Yeah yeah

[Yelawolf]
Here I go again, on my shit again
Walkin through the mall, actin like a prick again
You had a halter top, I had my Famous socks
You came to shop, I came to hoe hop
You had your girl wit'cha, both lookin great
I wanted both of y'all, how about a double take?
She was hatin lookin at me like a scumbag
But somethin made you wanna turn around and come back
Probably cause I just don't give a fuck
I just wanna see one of these hookers in my truck
So tell your girlfriend tough luck
She just wanna see you with somebody dressed up
Well - I really ain't into that type of shit
I'm into tattoos, drinkin 'til 6
Fuckin 'til 9, sleepin 'til 12
And goin back to my homies with a story to tell

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
This shit shoulda been finished
I'm as surprised as you are that you still let me in it
But you continue to text message me
Right after sayin that we should both move separately
But you don't wanna see me go
Even though I've only given you dick and cold cereal
So you must have a thing for Lucky Charms
Or the bad girl in you just fell in my lucky arms
You love to cuss me out and call me crazy
Say I'm no good and all of your friends hate me
Then you show up to my room and damn near rape me
And then it goes from "Fuck you" to "Fuck me, baby"
You leave early so nobody sees you at the spot
Now you're stuck between a hard place and a rock
You call me a player but I have lied to you not
Cause I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
Holler

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
I'm in jail again, on my Johnny Cash
Some dude was talkin shit, I had to whip his ass
Called you in the morning, and you just fuckin laugh
You think it's cute, you love my crazy ass
And I wonder if you'll ever leave my side
Cause the more that I ignore ya, the more you wanna ride
I tell you that I'm bad but you never ask why
Cause you just want the good from a really bad guy
You want a rock, let's rock and roll
Just know, I'm only good at one thing and it's not control
But I am consistent, that's somethin to be proud of
Cause I ain't shit wit'cha, and I ain't shit without you

[Chorus]

[Outro: Yelawolf]
To all the bad girls, tryin to be good
No such thing as a good girl gone bad
Just a bunch of bad girls tryin to go good
Holler at me mayne
Hello, my name is Yelawolf
I'm a sex addict, it's a disease
There's medication for it and everything...
I take pills</pre>
