One two, one two
For the Mental Street crew yall
Somethin like this, yall
Yeah, yeah, well check it out

LIFE to the MC
Life twists and turns makes a brother crazy
People flip, switch, some turn fake
About some nonsense job that I just cant relate

There was one that was phony, two that didnt know
The third fell a flake cause the fourth said so
My main man ? on some far out measures
He left a brother assed out with the rent check
Hey yo I cram to understand why people act shady
My ? face and he start to get flaky
The season of the snake, or should i say fake
Fools who never knew cause they never stood* true to anything (anything)
Or anyone (anyone)
Look at brothers now, hey yo the reason for they guns
They call me mc and a rap degenerate
Im not a role model one some hip hop senate
But damn I gets down for my fam underground
Rather uplift the next man, instead of slow him down
cause somehow the rental of brothers now is:
ÒHey yo, pull that brother back before he gets hisÓ
I used to hang with kids who did ill things to live
They wouldnt change they morals is like Òfuck thisÓ
The worlds about to blow up, Ive had enough kid
I let it go on, uninterrupted
cause when youre livin your life that distructive
It comes back ten times more, youre busted
But all of one of these wanna be big shotty
Show up at the club try to front on everybody
But we be Mass Influ
And we dont have to move for anything (anything)
Or anyone (anyone)

LIFE to the MC
Life twists and shifts makes a brother crazy
People flip, switch and some turn fake
About some nonsense job and I just cant relate

yo, LIFE to the MC
Life twists and turns makes a brother crazy
People flip, switch, some turn fake
About some nonsense job and I just cant relate

One two, one two
One two, one two two two
Check it out yall

We cant express to address of foul cops to be harassin
And the mass individuals and kids whos actin a bit
The masquerade sport in them star shades
The facade full ? you actin like you paid for
? your pants you get the one cent ?
And the jury hard rock
ÒThinkin you got a lot?Ó
You just fake perpetrate on some superstar status
While we stay grounded, scope well rounded
Ear to the street while you be dumb founded
To facts, you cant believe stuff changes overnight
With the red dog ? and the black ? lights
Now, niggers in the session with the fake gun fights
Say they wanna get down with mics mcin
But everywhere they go, its just niggers thats ODin and
Bitches singin outta tune with the loops
Fuckin up hip hop tracks, too many wack groups
Imagine you in 2000
Chemical type flows, leakin out the walls of your house, and
Sounds funny but if you can watch money
Change you and your friends to crash test dummies
Youd fail, for losin all in ya
Couldnt point a finger when you cocked your own hammer
Youre from Atlanta or you froms New York
It doesnt matter what type range of shit you talk
cause the LIFE of an MC
Im true to myself so I really cant be
Week with the move, yo 
We aint gotta prove this to anything (anything)
Or anyone (anyone)

LIFE to the MC
Life twists and turns makes a brother crazy
People flip, switch, some turn fake
About some nonsense job that I just cant relate

Yo LIFE to the MC
Life twists and turns makes a brother crazy
People flip, switch, some turn fake
About some nonsense job and I just cant relate

LI-FE to the MC
To the MC
LI-FE to the MC
To the funky MC

"How many real hip hoppers in the place right about now?" (5x)
