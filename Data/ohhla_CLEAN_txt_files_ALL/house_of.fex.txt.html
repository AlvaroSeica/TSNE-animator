[PHONTE]
Practiced every word
Rehearsed every line
Covered all my steps
This is why

[MUHSINAH]
I've seen a side of you werent meant for

[PHONTE]
Your house of cards is gonna fall

[MUHSINAH]
Sooner or later
You will pay for

[PHONTE]
Your house of cards is gonna fall

[MUHSINAH]
Too late to cry your gonna get yours

[PHONTE]
Your house of cards is gonna fall

[MUHSINAH]
Replay yesterday
Kept track of my time
Covered all my steps
This is why

[BOTH]
Ive seen a side of you werent meant for

[MUHSINAH]
Your house of cards is gonna fall

[BOTH]
Sooner or later you will pay for

[MUHSINAH]
Your house of cards is gonna fall

[BOTH]
Too late to cry your gonna get yours
Your house of cards is gonna fall

[PHONTE]
Gotta find my way home
Maybe there's a new day 
Can't stand it anymore
Gotta change these dirty ways
When you dont know what to do
And there's nothing left to lose
There's no one else to blame
The worst in me is you
Gonna be such a long way down
When you fall

[MUHSINAH]
When there's nothing more to say
In your bed your gonna lay
No disguise to help you hide 
It's the end of your masquerade
Gonna be such a long way down
When you fall

[BOTH]
I've seen a side of of you? werent meant for

[PHONTE]
Your house of cards is gonna fall

[BOTH]
Sooner or later
You will pay for

[MUHSINAH]
Your house of cards is gonna fall

[BOTH]
Too late to cry your gonna get yours
Your house of cards is gonna fall</pre>
