[BOOM BAM]
Shit done changed
Now the old down game to re-arrange (geah)
I feel the pain cause where I live thangs remain (right)
Outta control and ain't nobody here to blame
We point the fingers at each other
We got their sisters and their mothers (who?) - cryin'
Because their fathers and their brothers (damn) - are dyin'
Turn on at eleven o'clock news
And tell me whatchu see, which raids catch the blues
Statistic show
Is a fact and you can check it (pop! pop!)
That one nigga's dyin' every ten seconds
So if you don't wanna be part of the group
Don't think the trigger happy motherfucker won't shoot now (boo-yaa!)
Innocent victims get caught up
Very first drive-by throw up
The way niggas was broad up
To do onto others and they do to you
But nobody give a fuck so everybody best to duck, c'mon

[EIHT]
I live the life for the black man never pretend
One day life starts - one day life ends
Open your eyes to realize that you just can't win
Another ghetto train, another ghetto story begin, c'mon

[ROCC]
I got something to say (what up)
Big Rocc spit some' (c'mon)
I got a clip for that cracker burn ?? shit the riots (geah)
Was to check y'all
We ain't afraid (ping!)
Gotta ?? niggas down together like the slave days
A real nigga on some black shit
I'm not a racist
I'm down with anybody wanna make dead faces
Crooked-ass judge us (fuck 'em)
Sendin' homies away - every day (what?)
A new nigga, a new case, a new scene
Niggas breakin' down crime to their momma
Judge's lookin' like nigga face the drama (geah)
You in my world where niggas never win (never)
Welcome to the Pen (where?)
Home of the sin (geah)
I kick back and I'm smokin' ??
Think I leave Compton
Home of the shooting sport, nigga (COMPTON!)
Big Rock I do for self with mine
Keep that chrome
Case my life on the line, nigga

[EIHT]
I live the life for the black man never pretend
One day life starts - one day life ends
Open your eyes to realize that you just can't win
Another ghetto train, another ghetto story begin
I live the life for the black man never pretend
One day life starts - one day life ends
Open your eyes to realize that you just can't win
Another ghetto train, another ghetto story begin
(Fuck it)

[THA CHILL]
The L.A. rides pass with thick smoke like fog
And now they tellin' me I can't watch basketball (what?)
Cause the man with the money on vacation (ain't that a bitch?)
And on top on that they strike a fool's out on probation and parole
25 to life ain't nuthin' nice
I rather ???? to cop my thang with her knife
I get them fools that kill O.J.'s wife
And do that shit was creepin' where if it don't fit it must to quit
Bitch, you see the shit in front of your eyes
The World's about to end and everybody die (geah)
You better get ready, we under attack
The kids killing kids Mexicans and the Blacks
(What the fuck is that?!?)
Get the gat
Watch your back for the shank
I'm suited and booted like that fools at the bank
With the all armor suits yellin' not I'm 'bout to shoot
To smashin' off in the Coupe like I'm goin' off the loop, yeah

[EIHT]
I live the life for the black man never pretend
One day life starts - one day life ends
Open your eyes to realize that you just can't win
Another ghetto train, another ghetto story begin...

Geah
C'mon
Compton one time
Hey, c'mon
Compton two times, nigga
Ya know how the fuck we livin'
Original C.M.W.
To the fullest
Geah</pre>
