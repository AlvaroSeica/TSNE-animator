[Intro]
Dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggaz dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggaz dreams
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggaz dreams
From the hood
{*scratches*} Dreams

[Common]
From the hood, y'all
Yo, I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flippin pancakes
Plus she's trickin out the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake, her titties ain't fake
Fuckin in the car cause we just can't wait
to get home, early in the morn' gettin stoned
Pretty with her eyes low, bunny by her Bible
The type of bitch that Big said he would die fo'
is the type that I'd ride and stay alive fo'
Tats on her back, lookin all tribal
She knows shoes, like she knows survival
Well-put together, she weather the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonc√©'s song and she gotta perform
Whether fuckin or fightin, we gettin it on

[Chorus]
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggaz dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggaz dreams
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto niggaz dreams
From the hood
{*scratches*} Dreams

[Common]
I don't even say shit, she can feel it
I talks the realest, toenails acryllic
Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet
Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the black and stony
Ghetto Prince, she's my Apolloni'
Like trigger had the back of Tony, Montana
Reminded me of me of my, of my momma
Uhh, knowin the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a nigga's squares, not wantin me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My street sense is streets and I know who my friends is
Endless love for the money, power and clothes
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
She might get to snappin if the cabinets ain't closed
When the camera starts snappin, she ready to pose, ahh

[Chorus]

[Nas]
I notice all my flaws when it come to writin rhymes
Subject matter be changin too quickly at times
So I kick it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention
For me, gettin women turned from sport to addiction 
Powerful women playin the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes, congresswomen inflictin
pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic
They liked it, they dyked it, devices, twisted
'Til I get a nice chick to get me on some nice shit
Crib, raisin kids, Labrador behind a white fence
But I'm still single, lookin for Cleopatra
African queen, yo look at me I'm a bachelor
Y'all niggaz in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors
Cross the fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours
She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals, Valentino bags
is my etiquette, my manner's half hood, half class
Photographers, cameras
Caught us out there, the spotlight hope she can handle
She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit
Event havin sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumpin out a Bentley with some fresh Red Bottoms
You live the dream with me when you were just in the projects

[Chorus]

{*"Yeah" scratched to the end*}</pre>
