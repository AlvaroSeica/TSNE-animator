Song:   B.K. to Moscow
Typed by: DaSun Akbar

(Chorus) Razah x2
From Brooklyn to Moscow what we got now
Mezza Morta meets the Renaissance Child
From Red Hook to Russia now we move crowds
International, they bow down

[Hell Razah]
Since the days of Atari I follow the steps of Marcus Garvey
I ride on anything wrong that's not Godly
A shotgun get in my hand become a Sharpie
I write down the day of your death if you ain't spark me
The sequel was no room left to see a part 3
I'm back like Jason 40s with more weed
I spit it heavenly, my wisdom transform the melodies
Being black is like I already been born with felonies
A hundred bars like a Centipede pray for enemies
Got genes in me from the unseen and dead poets
Claustaphobic to one track minds that ain't focused
At the edge is a dead end road with Black Vultures
We might as well go and bury our self
We need help, seek health
Like knowledge and self or get shelved
Will I be noble and free?
A young mogul Noble Drew Ali
I stare like Constantinople show you who I be
See I'm in bars with cognac, cigars'
Happy ending from Maccabeez, Japanese massages
From the heavens where God lives
Regardless you press charges, we insert the cartridge
The Grim Reaper with a street sweeper
You hot boy I'm the heat seeker
You iced out I'ma deep freezer
And I don't think y'all don't want no beef neither
I got to Russia like a Saint Peter
