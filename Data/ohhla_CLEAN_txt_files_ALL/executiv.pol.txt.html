[Arlo Maverick]                    
I got a million dollar name with no money in the bank
Yeah my face on a bus, but ain't rich as you thank
Cause I'd rather be broke with my soul in tact
Than to be a rich nigga, that cannot go back
Some artists lose their edge to become dull knives
Imprisoned by the fear that their fans won't like
Songs that'll challenge, songs that provoke
Now their making pop tunes and they songs is a joke
So politically correct, they instinctively neglect
The possibility their fans are critically adept
Now with all due respect, and I do mean some
What makes you so smart and your fans so dumb
Notoriety, wood; Adaptation, maybe plastic
Despite poor sales you inducted them as classics
Now here we are to usher in, labels will not sucker them
Dilute the potency, just to bring some numbers in, nahhh
 
[Chorus 1X - Nuela Charles]                      
I'm gonna make it hard for them 
To ever knock me off that horse again (I'm standing up)
Up to the world I put my heart in this
You're not gonna knock me off 
I'm gonna make it hard for them 
To ever knock me off that horse again (I'm standing up)
Up to the world I put my heart in this
You're not gonna knock me off (I'm standing up)
 
[Dirt Gritie]               
My work it speaks volumes, my bank accounts mute 
But I have become numb to the losses of my pursuit 
This music it is a prism that I have shined through 
The colors of my lifes what I have shown you 
But what's an artist to do when his ribs are touching 
Work part time or find himself with nothing 
Held many a function sat in on discussions 
On how we can raise the bar a little something
But this is not a race, no cars, I'm not stunting 
I'm only trying to speak through bars like Stan Williams
Trying to reach the children who dream with eyes wide 
Trying to be the change that they need in their lives 
But it's not for me to judge this industry showed me love 
And has giving me power like the one holding the gun 
The one holding his tongue is he who has none 
I'll speak for the meek our voices as one  
 
[Chorus 1X - Nuela Charles]                      
I'm gonna make it hard for them 
To ever knock me off that horse again (I'm standing up)
Up to the world I put my heart in this
You're not gonna knock me off 
I'm gonna make it hard for them 
To ever knock me off that horse again (I'm standing up)
Up to the world I put my heart in this
You're not gonna knock me off (I'm standing up)
 
[Saint]                                    
In the wee hours of the morning
When everything is still (I'm standing up)
I lay staring at the darkness
Trying to find the will (I'm standing up)
 
Only to be plagued by roaches
Scorpions and mice (I'm standing up)
Not to mention politics
That's a big crock of tripe (I'm standing up)
 
The light became morning
And the morning became day 
Speaking for myself (I'm standing up)
I wish the darkness had stayed 
 
The morning became evening (I'm standing up)
The sun is going down
But equality and justice (I'm standing up)
Is nowhere to be found (Elevate, elevate, elevate)
Of all these plagues (I'm standing up)
I've had my fill
Even in the wee hours of the morning (I'm standing up)
When everything is still
 
[Outro - Oozeela &amp; Nuela Charles]
(I'm standing up)
The stone that the builder rejected 
(I'm standing up)
The stone that the builder rejected 
(I'm standing up)</pre>
