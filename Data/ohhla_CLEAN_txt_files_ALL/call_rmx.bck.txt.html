[Pharrell Williams]
Let's party

[Pusha T]
Imagine the Backstreet Boys here with The Neptunes
Call it the rec. room, play time now holla
Pusha be the one ya follow, slow mo
low low, thousand spokes on a gold Impala
Crushin', love my women in couples
One on each arm keep double the trouble
So I gotta shift 'em and shuffle, love how I twist 'em and tussle
Sex play next day call me huh

[Backstreet Boys]
Let me tell you the story bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
I said hi. I got a little place nearby, wanna go?
I should've said no, someone's waiting for me
But I called my girl up and said...

[Chorus]
Listen baby I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say it again, you're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby gotta go

Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

[Chorus]

[Malice]
Don't stay up and wait cause I'm gonna be somewhat late
I feel for ya if ya can't relate
I take getaways like two-day stays, but look still hit me on my two-way page
See I'm heavy in the streets like a creamed Denali
Cold outside we take trips to Maui
AJ, Brian, Kevin, Nick, and Howie
Accompanied by Clipse Pusha T and Mally

[Backstreet Boys]
Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
I said hi, I got a little place nearby, gotta go

[Chorus (2x)]</pre>
