[Intro]
Hmmmm..
Hmmmmm...
(Oooo All Gold)
Hmmmm...
Hmmmmm...
(All Gold)

[Cassie]
I'on fuck with broke bitches (bitches)
We ain't taking no pictures (no pictures)
Smoke weed and blow kisses (kisses)
Top speed and go missing (go missing)
You should be embarrassed (barrassed)
Talking about me (bout me)
Just shopping in Paris (Paris)
Minding my bidness

[Chorus]
It's just gold all in my chain (my chain)
Gold all in my ring (my ring)
Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch (just watch) babe

[Cassie]
Yes I'm still shopping like fuck it
Let's get it (let's get it)
Hate, but you love me
You just can't admit it (admit it)

[Chorus]
It's just gold all in my chain (my chain)
Gold all in my ring (my ring)
Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch babe
(Nigga Nigga Nigga)
Gold all in my chain (my chain)
Gold all in my ring (my ring)
Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch babe
(Nigga, nigga, nigga)

[Trina]
Trina,
Gold chain
Gold ring
Gold nails
Stepping out in all gold Chanel
Gold grill
Gold yacht
Stay fly
Say he wanna fly me round the whole world
DJ, champagne, naw mean, plus the Phantom came with a chauffeur
Bum bitches, fall back
So whack, you hoes ain't put in no work
Why, why, why you talking all that shit?
Honestly I don't give a fuck
You won't catch me with no broke nigga
I ain't taking no pictures (Nope!)
Middle finger to these bitches
Pop, pop, popped a Molly
I'm dancing- Wooooo!
Overseas me and Cassie (yea)
Fly bitches, get money!

[Chorus]
It's just gold all in my chain (my chain)
Gold all in my ring (my ring)
Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch babe
(Nigga Nigga Nigga)
Gold all in my chain (my chain)
Gold all in my ring (my ring)
Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch babe
(Nigga, nigga, nigga)

[Lola Monroe]
Three bad bitches but we mashing though
With the top chopped off like Cassie hoe
If your money lame that mean your pussy lame
And my clique Allstars, no rookie game
Versace couture, on my decor
Had to scream, rich shit bitch I buy Galour
24 karats gold is how we going tally hoes
And keep them bitches spinning like a motherfucking Marry Gold
Queen Arrow, bring sorrow, coffee colored Bugatti, a Queen borrowed
Starbucks, cars, trucks
My Queen sip ace, play your cards, Slut!
Hard top, soft top, that's a tough call
Hundred bottles of Ciroc, that's Puff call (hello)
Body cold, heart cold,
Fuck around and get my haters dipped in all gold

[Chorus]
It's just gold all in my chain (my chain)
Gold all in my ring (my ring)
Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch babe
(Nigga Nigga Nigga)
Gold all in my chain (my chain)
Gold all in my ring (my ring)
Gold all in my watch (my watch)
Don't believe me just watch babe
(Nigga, nigga, nigga)</pre>
