Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Losin' my mind
Yes I'm using my nine this time
Or should I decline and press rewind?
Losin' my mind
Yes I'm using my nine this time
Or should I decline and press rewind?

Ever since November hit
I can't remember shit
Unless I was in your chick
When I picked her she was a limber bitch
She say I sent her quick
And treated her as cold as Denver get
That wimper shit for simpers don't enter 'cause I'm winter trick
And I like my hoe's cold young dumb lungs done
Now shes an old soul, ate her like lamber throw rolls
Shorty's come and shorty's go
This skinny chick orgy blows
Horny bro lookin for thicky
Hunt her down like Lori Stroll
I'm plum start butt naked in my white socks
Might pop my top and hype the block when the light stops
Just call me cyclops
I see what others might not
The white cops are on me, aww man we're in a tight spot
Its ironic though I'm bad yep my mama grow
the lad who rob the corner co. for cash up in Monaco
I'm half native got a relative named Jeroni-ho
And this personas fuck the drama only honor dough
I know who died plus and who did it
Shot these sirens can you dig it
Cut off your arm and fan you with it
Some listen to me and say "damn you wicked"

[Chorus]
Losin' my mind
Yes I'm using my nine this time
Or should I decline and press rewind?
Losin' my mind
Yes I'm using my nine this time
Or should I decline and press rewind?</pre>
