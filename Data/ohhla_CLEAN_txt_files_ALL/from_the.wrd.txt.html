Whats happening Edinburgh yo Alude Reekie
Its where I come from mate its my city
But we aint getting in that game
We in the dugout mate the dugout shit
And theres no substitution so you feel more like a fan

Im not in the game but I still try and kick it
I dont understand the game its like its cricket
I was in the box my chance came I missed it
Looking at the side as they holding my digit
Im subbed off never getting my goals
My aims I took a shot but I lost control
Lost control its like I'm watching the telly
And I cant change shit and I seen it already
All the fame in the game is the same with the bright lights
All the dames and the chains and the ice right
Thats what I'd like ken man aye right
It wont happen to I so why write
I think I'm loosing my eye sight
I cant see anything happening in my life
See theres nothing new
So I picked up a mic just for something to do

Its just life and I'm sitting on the side lines
Its what its like as I'm sitting and I write lines
Its like game and I'm standing on the white line
More of a fan because man they dont like mine [x2]

Its frustrating to look at the game and
Your not playing you are just waiting
You didnt get picked so you are just raging
Feeling like Neo want to kill all the agents
Cause youve been waiting ages and ages
Writing out pages pages and pages
With no wages just battling stages
To get to the stage were you might be famous
See you could make a milli
Instead your mans shitty its far from Man City
And men dont pity because man I sound silly
Even though I just rip-it like a frog on a lily
Life is a bitch
Pulled her head back when I gave her a kiss
So its just a wish
Until I get her I'm in love with this

Its just life and I'm sitting on the side lines
Its what its like as I'm sitting and I write lines
Its like game and I'm standing on the white line
More of a fan because man they dont like mine [x2]

Its my city place where I rest at
Its where I rap and I'm saying wheres the rest at
What a pity I was sitting in my shit flat
Thinking whats the formation why am I left back
But am not making diss tracks
Thatd be a distract I dont risk that
Some dont diss some cunts would just chib back
Thats a fucked up angle like his cap
They act hard like a six pack
Open up that six pack click and they sip that
Sitting on the streets where the crews and the kids at
If you cruise through you get bruised and get kicked back
Like one twos cause teams they cant loose
Rather get locked up than concede to you
Believe its true and its nothing new 
But what else mate we got nothing to do

Its just life and I'm sitting on the side lines
Its what its like as I'm sitting and I write lines
Its like game and I'm standing on the white line
More of a fan because man they dont like mine [x2]

They dont like mine yeah play that beat out man
A chored this beat off that Nomak man hes got tidy beats
Yeah Edinburgh Alude Reekie you know the set its S.O.S.

Its just life and I'm sitting on the side lines
Its what its like as I'm sitting and I write lines
Its like game and I'm standing on the white line
More of a fan because man they dont like mine [x4]</pre>
