"Welcome to 'All Sports, All Day'.
 Today on the programme, trade talks
 continue in New York City, but it 
 doesn't disturb his productivity on the field."

	{"Now that I know what it is boy.."}

[Q-Tip]
For your epitaph, niggas laugh, chastity gassed
your ass, siphonin' out your cash, seein' the door, the flash
While I stay enclosed, walkin' out in my clothes
She said...
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}
You motherfuckin' right, wantin' this shit every night
Finish up, I hold her tight, wearin' feelin's on my sleeve
Even when I had to leave, cooler than the evening breeze 
Do you believe...?
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}
The Division One leader, in the rebounding maneuvering shorties, off the post
Goin' coast to coast, she on the hardwood, sub, I'm out the game
She sayin, "Nah, he good", I mean...
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}
For no amount of dough, franchise this man
Give him all the things you can
Think long-term plans, he be bringin' in the fans
Front-page magazine, listen to this lady scream:
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}
'Cause she know what's better for her
Toppin' in the peckin' order
Fluid like the runnin' water, nicest nigga? Kinda, sorta
When he screamin' just the slaughter, no matter the quarter
I get it..
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}
The club-house king, battin' practice, slug and swing
Game time's anything, when I'm in, you're 'bout a minute
Holdin' the bat, it's good as fact
She's out the park, and comin' back
She sayin':
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}
Everywhere you sit you get a good view of the ballplayer and all
and the famous hall inevitably will make a call
Hangin' memorabilia from your walls
This is why you can't trade me
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}

"When asked about the trade rumors, he simply replied
 that he's just here to produce, to put forth the best
 effort for his team."

	{"Now that I know what it is boy.."}

[Q-Tip]
You can put your money on a sure thing 
Certain profits will they bring
Ceremonies are the ringer, in the White House wing
Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring
Do you wanna trade?
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}
'Cause in the end as a teammate
You're lookin' for a that you can go to war
Leaves it all on the floor, always lookin' to score
Pep-talks in the locker-room
This is why you sing this tune
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}
And injuries can't make me sit out, I ball 'til you get out
Hook off, no di-doubt, and all like get out
I train for the pressure and come out fresher
Equipped for the game, you know my name
It makes me better
A cheer, for the whole team, let's go, for the whole thing
The ballots, that you're holding, MVP voting
And I, represent the sentiment, you're emoting
As you say:
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}
The physical ability, with mental capability
Look intimately, places me inside of your vicinity
And I ain't really seein' me vacatin' this community
I'm stayin' here:
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}
I'm glad that you feel this way
Here's where I like to play
I need to hear it everyday, they cheer for me, say, "Ole"
Wait a minute, "Andal√©"
I dunno, well, anyway:
	{"I wouldn't trade you for nothin'..."}

"There was a lot of talk, there was buzz
 and your name came up in the- in the trade rumors
 uh, how seriously did you take that?"
"Uh... uh, not serious at all really"</pre>
