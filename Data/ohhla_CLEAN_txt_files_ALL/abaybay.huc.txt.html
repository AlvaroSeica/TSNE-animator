[Intro - Repeat 4X]
A bay-BAY, a bay-BAY, a Bay-BAY

[Chorus]
You wanna know what we say in the club? (A bay-BAY!)
White folks, gangstaz, and the thugs (A bay-BAY!)
Stuntin wit a stack of dem dubs (A bay-BAY!)
Ridin ln a 'Lac wit a mug! (A bay-BAY!)

[repeat 2X]
I'm in the club holl'n - a bay-BAY!
A bay-BAY, a bay-BAY, a bay-BAY
A bay-BAY, a bay-BAY - I'm in the club holl'n

[Hurricane Chris]
When I holla "a bay-BAY!," I finna get my groove on
It's so hot up in the club, dat I ain't got no shoes on
Holdin up a big stack of dem HUNNIDS in a rubberband
Gurl don't ask me for no cash, cause I'm not dat other man
Everybody trippin cause I'm limpin when I'm walkin
and I'm pimpin when I'm talkin, I don't trick on chick dats talkin (nope)
Dem boys in da back, dey be rollin up they dough-dy
Then dey blow it till dey chokin' dats what go'lly cane talkin (yep!)
And when I see a bad chick, I'm holl'n out, "A bay-BAY!" (A bay-BAY!!)
I hope y'all ain't wit ya boi-friends cause I'on't care what dey say
And I'on't care wat he say, or she say (nope)
I'm in da DJ booth, takin pictures wit the DJ (yep)
You wanna know what we say, when clubs get crunk? (what?)
"A bay-bay, let it play, dat's my song, turn it up" (okay)
You wanna know what we say, when clubs get crunk? (what?)
"A bay-bay, let it play, dat's my song, turn it up" (okay)

[Chorus]

Now if you lookin for me, baby you can find me
Bangin in da Chevy candy-painted swangin nine deep
Ten cars creep wit my people right behind me
I showed them my chain now she holl'n, "Boy you blindin me"
I show my mouth piece to dem freaks now dey eyein me (yep)
Oh you got a pro'lem well I hope you ain't tryin me
Throw the car in park and then I reach under my seat
Hop out with my hand under my shirt that's where dat iron be (wassup?)
Yellow bone chirpin me she tryna see where I'ma be
You gon' let me get up in yo mouth, well dats where I'ma be
I don't pop trunk wit lights, dats where dey choppa be
Straight to the hotel all the bad chick is followin me (c'mon)
I know you like my style, I ain't trippin I'm just tryna see (yeah)
Girl, is you drunk? Well, tell me why you leanin all on me? (dang!)
And if you thankin I won't STUNT, you trippin (hahaha)
I pull up in an Expedition wit the roof missin

[Chorus]

A bay-bay, let it play, dat's my song, turn it up (turn it up)
I'm in the club hot, crunk, sweatin, burnin' up (I'm hot!)
I'm bouncin thru the crowd buckin, and holl'n wassup
and I done FELL out in the dance flo' and now I cain't get up (eh ha ha)
J's on your feet, but you cain't get THESE  -   (nope)
Louis Vuitton brown, white, and yellow - trick please! (yep)
I'll go to St. Louis and let my "Chain Hang Low" (yea)
Canary yellow diamonds mixed wit rose gold
I shine real bright in the light because I'm a star
Eight shots of Patrons now I'm standin on the bar
Pro'ly get drunk as a skunk and put the keys in a wrong car
Pro'ly get drunk as a skunk and put the keys in a wrong car

[Chorus]

[Repeat many times along with sped-up and slowed-down samples]
A bay-bay, let it play, dat's my song, turn it up, hey!</pre>
