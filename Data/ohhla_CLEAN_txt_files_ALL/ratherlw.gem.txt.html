[Ace 1]
"Lovin' you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live alone, don't lie"

Chorus: Big Gemini
I rather live wrong
If being right means being without you
That's just somethin' I can't do
I need ya, shit, I want you
You know I got to have you, baby
If being right means being without you
That's just somethin' I can't do
I need ya, shit, I want you
You know I got to have you, baby

[Big Gemini]
(Verse 1)
I rather live wrong than right
Than go through this life
Worried all day and hump all night
Tossin' and turnin'
Prayin' for a miracle
Barely gettin' by, some off brand cereal
Been there
Done that
Never wanna go back
Could've had it worst, see the way it wasn't pleasant
I gotta have it
If you ain't got it, better get it
Survival of the fittest, y'all gon' see that I'm fitted
From the kicks to the shooks, to the heads that match
Went from trashy to classy, how real is that
Money's the root of all evil
Some might say
But til somebody broke that, and see if they care
Dawg, I did it 360, let my chrome run and (Spins)
Now I get smirched from them so-called (Friends)
I thought y'all be happy to see one advance
With more money, more problems, I just take 'em chips (Yeah)

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Why you think dudes
Hustle in these streets
To make ends meet
You ain't gotta agree, when muh'fuckers gotta eat
I don't knock no hustlin', I don't knock nobody
Get Rich like 50 or you better Die Tryin'
I need this shit
Gotta have my grip
I'm tryin' to set my momma up
And my unborn kids
Since my past was gloomy, I'm a make my future bright
And walk through hell, now to make it all right
Where there's a chance, I'll take it, I'll risk it all
For the bigger picture hangin' in my mental wall
That only I see and only I can achieve
I got a voice in my head, sayin' M.O.E.
So it's Money Over Everythang, really everythang
Over bitches or anybody that doesn't feel the same
Shit, if that's livin' wrong, well then, I can't be right
Cause everyone had a life, needs a sacrifice
And it's mine

Repeat Chorus

[Ace 1]
"Oooh-hoo-hoo
Lovin' is wrong
I don't wanna do right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live alone, don't lie"</pre>
