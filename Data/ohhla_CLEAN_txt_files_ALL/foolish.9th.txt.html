[singer]
Oooh-ooh ooh
Ohh ohh ohh
Whaat.

[Chorus x2: singer]
You don't know nothin' 'bout me
How you just comin' at me
with your game, just you wait and see
Boy, one day you're just so nice and sweet
And then just wanna play me
Check yourself cuz you ain't all you seem to be

[9th Prince]
Aiyo forever my lady, hold me down with the .380
Love is shitty but it's all gravy baby
Caramel complexion is crazy, opposite of lazy
Swing low on the daisy, only if my honeycomb blaze me
Stop breakin' my balls, 9th Prince stands tall
Always there when you call before you walked out of court
You broke my gold album, snapped it on the wall
Girlfriends jealous, prayin' for our downfall
Spendin' nice out of state, wearin' Victoria Secret
Lingerie, reminisce about our first day we made love
Off old school Kay Slay mixtapes
Even though we fight you never change a heart of my shipmate
Baby girl holdin' weight like Trina
Jewelery shoppin' in Medina with the Nina
Charged with a misdemeanor, more cleaner
Than Cleopatra, tell me have you see her?
Ballet classes in the arena like ballerina
I duely fiend for her body
Spendin' dollars like Bill Cosby
Keepin' you happy is my hobby
But still you say I'm sloppy
If love was a crime you'd be charged with heart robbery
Holiday Inn, platinum skins
You my best friend, we a combination like juice and gin
Mercedes Benz, I'm about to blow like wind
Complete big house on the low out in Gaten Island
Baby boo you wildin'

[Hook x2: singer]
You think you can catch up to me
My power is your destiny
It's my game, I'm gonna make you see
Boy you don't know nothin' 'bout me
So you won't be comin' at me
with your fool ways, you hear me when I say...

[9th Prince]
9th Prince used to be a heartbreaker
Now I'm the Undertaker, baby girl keep gettin' paper
One day we'll be makin' love in the skyscraper
My Foolish Ways made you a hater
Found phone numbers with my tapin' of Fantasia
Caught my holdin' hands with Aiasia
Your little sister blew me up like Skytel pager
Callin' me out my name like I'm Elaine
Every man is a dog, it ain't the same
Like P.R., who's to blame?
Love is like crack/cocaine, get addicted to the wicked games
Crafted, into the hall of shame
With your birthday how you want it, Kawasaki or Mazurati?
Never could stand you dancin' with other brothers in parties
You made me jealous hangin' with the Goodfellas
Ain't nothin' no one could tell us
Big as the secret lovers
Long hair, brown skin like Donna Summers
Baby girl you're my Wonder Woman.. Wonder Woman

[Chorus x2]</pre>
