[Verse One]
What makes you feel
And why you gotta be
Like you got the right
To look her up and down
What makes this world
so sick and evil?
I, don't, want to know

[Verse Two]
What makes you feel
Like you've got whip appeal
Who made you the judge and jury?
Ain't you never heard of privacy?
What makes this world
so sick and evil?
You figure it out
You figure it out</pre>
