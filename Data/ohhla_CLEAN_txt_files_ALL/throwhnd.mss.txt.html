Yo, this the Queen B
And I came to say, a lil' somethin on my girl Missy shit
You see, I got somethin to say
That's right, I got a problem..
I got a problem with all y'all motherfuckers out there
that got a problem with us calling ourselves a bitch~!
Yeah that's right I said it, motherfucker - BITCH! What!
You see.. bitch is a STRONG word and only STRONG bitches 
could use that motherfuckin terminology - BITCH!!
Hah, I mean, if you can't wear the name, don't try to use it
Shucks

[Missy Elliott]
Throw your hands up, if you like to get high
Tim, make a phat beat so we can party all night
If you got beef, you got to take it outside
Throw your wrist up and let me see your eyes shine
Throw your hands up, if you like to get high
Tim, make a phat beat so we can party all night
If you got beef, you got to take it outside
Throw your wrist up and let me see your eyes shine</pre>
