[Verse 1: Young Chris]
I ask is it me, or is it really them?
Yea I'm young, but y'all ain't never gonna big Willy hum

Them ain't never been soft, naw dawg
Y'all really them niggaz that be mouthin' off
Never really got in shit

But hesitate to pop it off
When it's on, y'all be gone
C grip the pistol, drawn
Hittin' till' them niggaz gone

This ain't just a song, this is real shit we live
Niggaz will get ya kids, hurry niggaz switch your homes
Don't forget ya pistol, home, what the fuck you buy it for
To catch a fuckin' body, or to show up for them bitches ?????
Actin' all big and buff
Niggaz ain't really tough
Humble, but he might just be the first to call you niggaz bluff
Have you niggaz shittin' puss

All hollows in ya gut
So you holla when it cuts
Let off a dime, then I calm

You'll be sparkin' like a dutch
Keep the shit up on a hush
Out on bail, fresh outta jail
Two cases, I got to fight nigga
They sent me down try to right niggaz
They want me up north, stressin' with them white niggaz
Gettin' husky, fuck it let 12  judge me

But tell me why you mad dude like Big O skits mitts

[Verse 4: Oschino]
Oschino...nigga...SP
We want we want
That boy in the Porsche with the top in the trunk
Oschino long like joker clip all hanging out
Money over bitches what this SP gang about
Bought it like brotha man gas like son of Sam
One through your face leave your stretched like a rubber band
You wouldn't understand you don't want it fam
The MC with the hammer have yall niggaz do the running man
Born in the ghetto straight form the projects
Game like LeBron James but no Nike contract
Pitbull red nose 600 all gold marshland all froze
Low top red holes red shoe strings no socks on
Mr. Matinee be moving that popcorn
Yall niggaz should stop drawing your oil  paintings stink
While we in the kitchen cookin oils till they stink
