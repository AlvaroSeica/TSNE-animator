This playground is really impressive!
I can't believe no one ever brought us here
This place is really, it's really retro
It's really OLD!!
(My dad says it's dangerous)
(for kids, to be here by themselves)
(You don't understand the trouble we could get into)
I'm gonna ignore that warning
cause this place looks like so much fun
And look how cool it is
And there's swings, and a slide
a jungle gym AND a merry-go-round!
This place has got EVERYTHING!!!!!</pre>
