Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
You little niggaz better stay in your lane
We all know ya'll lame they ain't got shit on me
So what you sold a couple records
Got a necklace listen dog check it they ain't got shit on me
I've done em all sold the most from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag or boast they ain't got shit on me
They all try, they all try to be the dog
They never will, they never will, so knock it off

Shit, I ain't nothing like these dudes
Only kid walkin 'round with ten G's in grade school
Chilling at the Grammy's rockin with Madonna
I know that I'm the hottest shit
I'm just being honest
I'm the competition killer I'm all about my skrilla
Fucking up the city you can call me Godzilla
And the Maybach's vanilla
I'm fresh from the dealer
The fans don't fuck with you 'cause they know I keep it realer

[Chorus]
You little niggaz better stay in your lane
We all know ya'll lame they ain't got shit on me
So what you sold a couple records
Got a necklace listen dog check they ain't got shit on me
I've done em all sold the most from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag or boast they ain't got shit on me
They all try, they all try to be the dog
They never will, they never will, so knock it off

While you was at school I was on tour with doctor Dre and
Snoop, now I'm in your local cinema starring in my own flicks
Niggaz think they doing it wifing up my old chicks
I fly private that's the difference
Fountain Bleu chilling pool side with some bitches
And your career just don't compare to mine
And like the diamonds in my chain I'm supposed to shine (told you)

[Chorus]
You little niggaz better stay in your lane
We all know ya'll lame they ain't got shit on me
So what you sold a couple records
Got a necklace listen dog check it they ain't got shit on me
I've done em all sold the most from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag or boast they ain't got shit on me
They all try, they all try to be the dog
They never will, they never will, so knock it off

So don't compare to me these niggaz is weak
300 thousand cash I make that in my sleep
So what you saying lil homie you had you a hit
But see one's not enough
You gone need bout 6 to compete with the dog
Top bill ball never open up I headline my tours
I'm leading the pack, You watchin me nigga
You won't find nobody else Who can top me nigga

[Chorus]
You little niggaz better stay in your lane
We all know ya'll lame they ain't got shit on me
So what you sold a couple records
Got a necklace listen dog check it they ain't got shit on me
I've done em all sold the most from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag or boast they ain't got shit on me
They all try, they all try to be the dog
They never will, they never will, so knock it off

(Bow Wow) Who they talking about (Bow Wow)
Yeah who thy talking about (Bow Wow)
Who they came to see (Bow Wow)
Yeah
I think it's understood
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
You little niggaz better stay in your lane
We all know ya'll lame they ain't got shit on me
So what you sold a couple records
Got a necklace listen dog check it they ain't got shit on me
I've done em all sold the most from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag or boast they ain't got shit on me
They all try, they all try to be the dog
They never will, they never will, so knock it off</pre>
