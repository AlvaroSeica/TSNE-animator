I'm on now so fuck yall 
and I put myself on I dont need yall 
I been fly no free fall 
what up haters I dont see yall 

fresher than the rest of you 
fresher than the rest of you 
fresher than the rest of you  pirate gang 

fresher than the rest of you 
fresher than the rest of you 
fresher than the rest of you young star life 

b-l-o-x 
they're mad I made it inspired by all who hated
b-l-o-x dont hate the new kid I'm on some new shit 

tag on the walls thats urban art
geeked out swag give it a urkle start 
my purple heart I warrior left her wet wit euphoria
my minds lost in the minds of moria all I hears orchestra 
my eyes wide shut Beethoven ill see no more of ya 
they doubted how I sounded diamond in the ruff unfounded 
crown is on us only honest break em before I ever break a promise 
wu inspired fly and flawless I'm heat like degrees in august 
higher like Allah is heightened senses and I sense I'm on bitch

fresher than the rest of you 
fresher than the rest of you 
fresher than the rest of you  pirate gang 

fresher than the rest of you 
fresher than the rest of you 
fresher than the rest of you young star life 

b-l-o-x 
they're mad I made it inspired by all who hated
b-l-o-x dont hate the new kid I'm on some new shit 

schools out no recess 
you could catch a head shot no cs
what we did dont tell your bf 
its pirate gang you should get some GF 
tattoos and camo  tattoos and camo 
take a second look naw you dont got these vans ho 
tattoos and camo tattoos and camo 
take a second look pay attention to my swag yo 
profitin off of em all of em hollerin 
offerin all a their shit but I'm good good offa those tricks 
I'm on my solo dolo tip 
dont need a chick money over bitches 
this is iller then sickness hit em with the quickness 
get em on the guest list hit the exit
get em back to the telly give em all the business 
thats what my lifes bout I skate and grind out 
seen your name at the top I hit it with the white out 
I light bulb when the lights out 
and when its night time I night owl 
my hearts igloo bitch like you aint iced out 
fresher than the rest a you fresher than the rest of you 
chasin this dream I almost went through every shoe 
fresher than the rest of you fresher than the rest of you
dont hate the new kid I'm on some new shit

I'm on now so fuck yall 
and I put myself on I dont need yall 
I been fly no free fall 
and this is where 

this is where it gets dirty...</pre>
