[whispered 2X]
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out-watch out
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out-watch out

[quote from the lyrics are heard]

[Lyrics Born]
In the beginning men and women had an obligation to they children

[Lateef the Truth Speaker]
Then there was a real and true necessity and need for building

[Lyrics Born] To instill the discipline and will, proliferate the lineage
[Lateef] Matters of the spirit, mind, and body taken serious
[Lyrics Born] But the way that we became what we became, somebody please 
explain
[Lateef] Well we can tell you if your curious, those that reign got the 
masses in chains and their minds enslaved
[*both*] And that's the part that makes me furious

[whispered 2X]
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out-watch out
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out-watch out

[repeat 2X]
'Cause there definitely ain't, no info readily available
To the general lay people, so let me know

[Lateef]
It's these elitist multimedia creeps that feed shit to the neediest
It's the greediest trying to cheat us out of our God-given rights

[Lyrics Born]
To a quality education, minimal opportunities available
Limited occupations, we are not given a choice

[Lateef]
Or given a voice within a political system pimped and gangstered-out
wherein the people are the victims, sheep, being led about

[Lyrics Born]
While the followers and patrons of any faith outside the mainstream
are berated, falsely painted as endangering the way things were

[L] And the way things are tonight,
[LB]I can't believe that things ain't worse
[L] With all the wicked seeds we've sown have grown
[LB] And poisoned all the earth
[L] It's serves us right
[LB] Can't really act surprised when the harvest has no worth
[L] The curse that lurks around the corner
[*BOTH*] Is the product of our work

[whispered 2X]
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out-watch out
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out-watch out

[Lyrics Born]
(RIGHT NOW!)
The holy war is growing, opposing forces pony up
the origins of which have been historically ignored

[Lateef]
(RIGHT NOW!)
Our foreign policy is meddling in some democracy
upholding an aristocracy of secret terrorist cells

[Lyrics Born]
(RIGHT NOW!)
The global poverty that we accept so commonly
turns people into property, one step away from hell

[Lateef]
(RIGHT NOW!)
Health care battles, bioengineering
for the worldwide scare of the plague that we're fearing

[Lyrics Born] (RIGHT NOW!) They have the right to put your life under 
surveillance
[Lateef] (RIGHT NOW!) They got the right to lock us up, we don't obey 'em
[Lyrics Born] (RIGHT NOW!) Modern education don't prepare the youth
[*both*] (RIGHT NOW!) [RIGHT NOW!] Do what you gotta do!
[Lyrics Born] (RIGHT NOW!) There's people shootin' at people that's throwin 
stones
[Lateef] (RIGHT NOW!) There's a movement of evil across the globe
[*both*] RIGHT NOW is where we at, what comes around goes around
TIME FOR ACTION BEFORE THE LAST TRUMPET SOUNDS!

[humming and ad-libs]

[Lateef]
(RIGHT NOW!)
Opposing forces pony up for a cause so glorious
but he who stands alone with justice, none touches

[Lyrics Born]
(RIGHT NOW!)
The only option we can profit from is movement
toward the positive progressive thought that's rooted up in consciousness

[Lateef]
(RIGHT NOW!)
Grass roots run deep, troops do
diffuse confusion stewed by rude groups loose

[Lyrics Born]
(RIGHT NOW!)
We can benefit if we can pool our energy collectively
Project it in a direction used effectively

[Lateef] (RIGHT NOW!) We have the opportunity for self-improvement
[Lyrics Born] (RIGHT NOW!) We can reinforce the strength of the family unit
[Lateef] (RIGHT NOW!) Our community, it must support the youth
[*both*] (RIGHT NOW!) [RIGHT NOW!] Do what you gotta do
[Lateef] (RIGHT NOW!) There's people looking for people with common goals
[Lyrics Born] (RIGHT NOW!) There's a movement of unity across the globe
[*both*] RIGHT NOW is where we at, what comes around goes around
TIME FOR ACTION BEFORE THE LAST TRUMPET SOUNDS!

[whispered as many times, while DJ Shadow cuts and scratches]
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out-watch out
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out-watch out</pre>
