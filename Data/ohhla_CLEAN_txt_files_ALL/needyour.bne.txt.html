[Chorus]
If you ever wanna meet some one
I forever wanna be the only one, in your life
Need your body, oh baby, need your body
Ohhh darling...
If you ever wanna meet some one
I forever wanna be the only one, in your life
Need your body, yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Krayzie]
Now I done been around the planet met plenty women but I never met
One like you, you sue me, ooh, nobody can do me like you do we
Hang out we get high, you roll my blunts up for me, I'm feelin' you
Girl but I know we just homie, but your the kind of girl, that'll
Make a nigga wanna be down the type of girl I need to be around
Not like them other groupy bitches on my dick for money, I could
See it in your eyes your shit is genuine and me and you been together
Whatever, but if your lookin' for a chill nigga hook up with a real
Nigga, it's guaranteed that if you fuck with Kray, y'all, never ever
Wanna go away, so if your lookin' for a nigga that can hit it and
Stay in it never quit it make you feel it when I split it I'm a
Dinner guinea and you'll be happy with a thug like me them toughs
Don't love like me girl they can't fuck like me, like me

[Chorus]
If you ever wanna meet some one
I forever wanna be the only one, in your life
I need your body, ohhh, I need your body
Ohhh darling...

If you ever wanna meet some one
I forever wanna be the only one, in your life
I need your body, yeah, yeah, yeah, I need your body

[Layzie]
Hey, pretty lady I've been thinkin' about you constantly the way you
Put it on me girl you really did drop the bomb on me, you's a freak
And I'm a freak and I'm thinkin' this how it's supposed to be, it's
Already been written girl 'posed to be here close to me, come on and
Close up with me you the realest, illest picture perfect woman that
I ever done seen before, promise to make it worth it, you deserve it
My purpose is to satisfy your every need, satisfy you mentally
Especially sexually, nothin' but the best from me, come on and enjoy
The ride, I keep it strong all night long I'm a make you mine, you wanna
Take your time, and I respect your pimpin', you workin' hard you went
Dependent tryin' to earn a livin' and I'm tryin' to beat the system
But I know you dig a thug your cup of lovers lookin' empty let me fill
It up, is it really worth I really wanna thug, and I need your body
I can't get enough

[Chorus]

[Bizzy]
Candle lit dinners expensive dishes I'm thuggish ruggish the definition
Of ballin' while dippin' in Columbus, spit game like holy water in my
Saliva, the taste of your tongue comes let me set your neck on fire
Smokin' chronic and swishers I am your ex-peal your body's beautiful
Everybody feel you for real, watchin' movies and fuckin' close to the
Sliding door I want you to come with the thunder then do it once more I gotta
Be real, you love me cause I'm such a gangster, hoodlum with a ten chances
Ghetto kid like Jo-Jo Dancer, do you really want the handsome while you
And your man are still beepin' your thinkin' about me and he's thinkin'
Of kickin' it on the weekend always be my damn, always be my broad
No matter how much you fuck 'em you'll always be my dog so let me hit it
From the back one more time, just for old time slap on a mag let me go
For mine, hey

[Chorus]

If you ever wanna meet some one
I forever wanna be the only one, in your life
I need your body, ohhh, I need your body
Ohhh darling...

If you ever wanna meet some one
I forever wanna be the only one, in your life
I need your body, yeah, yeah, yeah, I need your body</pre>
