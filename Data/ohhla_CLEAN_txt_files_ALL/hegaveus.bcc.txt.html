He gave his life today..
It was a, roadblock comin to a full stop
Canines, snipers on the roof top
Yellow team, orange cones, blue lights
----show a quarter past midnight
Hospital got my old lady screamin
Red-eyed, wavy-haired black demon
Tell me is this what I asked for?
It ain't like a nigga never saw blood before, but
He gave his life today..
Could have sworn I saw the heavens open
The world wonderin why I gave up smokin'
They wonderin why I gave up smokin'
I've seen too many premonitions
From the cradle to the grave of our existence
Where one leave, one return into flesh
When that man took his life my son took his first breath so
(What)

He gave his life today..
So many youths drop out, livin the gangsta life
He gave his life today..
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise
He gave his life today..
Oh you got to think about your life seriously
He gave his life today..
Freedom or life life locked up in the penitentiary?

Yo
I wrote a song for the soldiers in the trenches
It's a long way from home stay strong on the mission
Since you've gone not much been given
Pop proud, mom misses sent a letter with a picture
I ain't there with ya but I'm there with ya
Take care mista we still here with ya
Cause we care nigga
Over there similar to over over here
Be prepared nigga
God forbid these the words I hear nigga
He gave his life today..
That'll make pop crazy have mama screamin "Not my baby."
The good die young that's what they sayin'
In the hood where I'm from that's an understatement
Call it the matrix where rodents and snakes live
The world of hatred we go on to make it
We make sure before we leave this game
The Boot Camp Clik name's associated with greatness

He gave his life today..
So many youths drop out, livin the gangsta life
He gave his life today..
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise
He gave his life today..
Think about your life seriously
Freedom or life life locked up in the penitentiary
He gave his life today..
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise

I should be greatful and thankful for what I have
Cause some don't even have half of what I have
They say "Henny on some shit"
Won't let mere niggaz slide cause that's how my homie died
They took his kindness for a weakness
And over the weekend
They left my boy sleepin
That's why I can't play with ya
Cause if you cross me, shit, I'm a let them thangs hit ya
He gave his life today..
He was a good dude
Good son, good father to his seed
Told him "Be all you wanna be"
Word up, I miss my road dogg
You know, gridin shinin', shoppin' and club hoppin'
Whatever the bank was my boy stopped it
A quick 4, 5, 6 and then it's in the pocket
My boy was too raw

He gave his life today..
So many youths drop out, livin' the gangsta life
He gave his life today..
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise
He gave his life today..
Think about your life seriously
Freedom or life life locked up in the penitentiary
He gave his life today..
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise

Look at your boy now he tryin' to come up
Think he grown cause he can curse and roll up
Hold up, I know that ain't a pistol shorty
You barely a teen what you mean you rip through shorty
And who said it was corny to be cool
Better than be a savage or you'd rather be that fool?
The facts prove that that move is not smooth
I got niggaz pushin' flowers like that, who knew
And if he would've thought smarter
He might've been able to start a
Family, damn a G fall for the same thing
So I keep you dry in the rain
No shame will remain there's so many things in the game
That'll mess with your brain so maintain
Cause I knew a shorty your age
Thirteen, shot by a thirty-year-old gauge, and

He Gave His Life today..
So many youths drop out, livin' the gangsta life
He Gave His Life today..
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise
He Gave His Life today..
Think about your life seriously
freedom or life in the penitentiary
He Gave His Life today..
Locked away for a century

So many youths drop out, livin' the gangsta life
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise
Think about your life seriously
Freedom or life in the penitentiary
Send him a lord with the red and the blue
And there be a wicked man holdin' down your crew
You don't know what they will or won't do
Now the gun bangin' at you
He Gave His Life today
So many youths drop out, livin' the gangsta life
Tryin' to live the gangsta's paradise
Think about your life seriously
Freedom or life in the penitentiary
Locked away for a century</pre>
