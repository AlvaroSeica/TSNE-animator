[Akon]
A moment ago it seemed, it was yesterday
You were here with me, and everything seems to be the same
What am I supposed to do, with all these empty rooms?
Sit here in solitude, with the smell of your perfume

[Chorus]
You never took the time to know me
You never took the time to understand
You never took the time to know me, yeah
Cause lovin you is all I ever had
Said lovin you is all I ever had

[Akon]
This wasn't what I wanted to be, a man in misery
Girl I look back a thousand times and can't believe that you left me
(Why you leave me baby?)
Why can't you understand my pain? How can I explain?
Girl I don't know what I'm doin wrong
I can't believe that your love is gone

[Chorus]
Cause you never took the time to know me
(Said you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand (ohhhhh yeah)
Said you never took the time to know me
(Said you never took the time to know me)
See lovin you is all I ever had (had, I had)
Baby, lovin you is all I ever had

[instrumental for 33 seconds]

[Akon]
Ooh yeah
You're all I need
You're all I see
And I wish that we could DO IT AGAIN

[Chorus/Outro]
Cause you never took the time to know me
(Baby you never took the time to know me)
You never took the time to understand (ohh-ohh-ohh, ohhh, yeah)
Said you never took the time to know me, yeah (ohhh)
Because of you now I'm just a lonely man (ohh)
Because of you now I'm just a lonely man</pre>
