(DJ Kizzy Rock)
Grand champion
I'm the world wide boss
Takin' out fake bass rappers
Comin' soft, never lost
Hard like a cigarette cough
DJ Kizzy Rock goes off...(Ye-ah)
Ay, sucka' DJ, can I get da mike?
Can I get dis mutha'fucka' crunk tonight?
Cause-da dance-floe, lookin' kinda weak
AND WHY YOU PLAY DA SAME BULLSHIT EVERY WEEK?
Be unique, shawty
Represent da south
Stop sayin' every chant
Comin' out my mouth
If-you want-to
Buddy, pick a spot
BETTER BE A CLUB WIT' A PACKED PARKIN' LOT
DJ Kizzy Rock 
came from da underground
Takin' over every club
Jumpin' in my town
Step aside
DJ, meanin' no harm
Just comin' through
Wit' da power-stiff arm, whuuuuut!
