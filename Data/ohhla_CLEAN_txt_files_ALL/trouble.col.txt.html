[Bei Maejor]
I I I I
I told you, not to wear that dress to the club tryna dance up on me
I I I
I told you, not to push that thing on me
If you know I want it

[Chorus]
That's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
That's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)

Baby I told you, not to wear them heels that make them legs look so sexy
I I I I
I told you
Not to wear them heels that say I'm ready come get me
Ay Ay

[Chorus]
They gon get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
They gon get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
They gon get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
They gon get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)

Go up to my room, you've been such a, such a bad girl
Such a sexy naughty girl
You know what you doing baby
Go up to my room girl
You've been such a, such a bad girl
Such a sexy naughty girl
(Oooh, oooh)

[J. Cole]
Yeah, temptations in the whirlwind
We both bad at it
Told myself no more hittin' nigga's girlfriends
That's my old bad habit
Here you go, wearin' that
Already know, what I'm staring at
I mean from top to bottom your body is problem so
Somebody better take care of that
And who
Better than, the nigga in the letterman
When your man ain't home, you can let him in
Late night Letterman
I ain't gon tat-a-tale
Damn your ass bad as hell

[Chorus]
That's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
That's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)

I told you not to stare at me like that while I'm performing
I-I-I-I told you
That's that's gon' make us til the early morning

[Chorus]
That's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
That's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)
It's gon' get you in trouble
(Oooh, oooh)</pre>
