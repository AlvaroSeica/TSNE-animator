[Intro/Chorus]
People want my power
And they want my station
Stormed my winter palace
But they couldn't take it
All the way to Paris
Run my reputation
Try to pull my status
But they couldn't fake it
Hey {*32X*}

[Santigold]
Trying to pull a full-on, your guys won't go
Grande chicken in your ass, oh no
Man lookin for your ticket, now let's all go
Party's in a minute but you guys won't go
Man you look on, you look on your bracelet
But I'm too gone, I'm too gone, that ass oh no
When you get on, you get on, you shake it
Man you took on, you took on too much, don't blow

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
Can I get a witness, a closer look
Everybody itchin for a throne to throw
And you could be the widget, to my turbo
Better see your status when I go solo
Do you forget the, forget the basics?
On a go long, a go long, you must go search
And it's too far, it's too far the bases
But you're slippin, you're slidin
Can make it go

[Chorus]

[Santigold]
How hard we found
Another instrument to crash you
Crash you, crash you
I need another instrument to crash you
Crash you, crash you
I need
Ha, ha, crash you {*6X*}
