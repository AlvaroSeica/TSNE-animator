"Nobody saw me walking
And nobody heard me talking
Seems like I gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong
Before they notice me" --&gt; The Whispers

[Verse 1: A.L.T.]
Back in the days before I kicked it on the blocks
Since a child, in the front yard, I used to play with blocks, man
Momma was a good momma, watched me like a hawk
But I loved drama, used to watch 'em gangstas slangin' rocks
On the playground
Man, I would prove that I was down
Take the fattest little bully and I'd always knock him down
You better run, and teachers used to think that I was dumb
After school, at the store, I'm jacking candy and gum
As a teen, I turned it into vodka and rum
I got popped at fifteen and did a year for a gun
While I was bustin', that was when I started writing songs
And it seems like I gotta do, I gotta do wrong

Chorus: Bobby
"Seems like I gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong"
"Seems like I gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong"
"Seems like I gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong"
"Seems like I gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong, gotta do wrong" --&gt; The Whispers

[Verse 2: Young De]
It wasn't my choice (Naw)
Cause God gave me this voice
And I had to make it happen, rappin' or scrappin' {*nigga*}
Any means necessary, do good or do bad
Fuck it, I just did what I had to do
No, I ain't askin' you
Should I, could I, no questions
I keep on steppin', with my hand on my weapon
There's lessons to be learned, every dollar that you earn
Make a {*nigga*} slow down cause he gotta wait his turn (Turn...)
And I'm back smokin'
Back spittin' that potent poetry, too deep to play games
Too deep to say names, too deep to ride with lame
Dudes like you and your crew
We gettin' paid, get paper (Paper...)

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Frost]
Now I never been in love, but I did come close
And this girl had the most ass on the west coast
She a rider, so I had to sit down beside her
More ass than a donkey, more legs than a spider
And she flexes, so I had to dump my ex's
Them titties were big, just like Alaska and Texas
She drove a Lexus, had to cash in a credit
Man, I'm a hustler, I had to go and get it
But this cheeba's gon' fuck it up fo sho if I let it
She believe anything I say, if I said, I said it
But one time, homey, I was gone too long
And my woman said, "Enough, mayne, you gotta do wrong"

Repeat Chorus</pre>
