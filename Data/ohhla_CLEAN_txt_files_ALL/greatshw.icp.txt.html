house of mirrors and killing fields

Verse 1:Violent J
aaah shit!

and im leadin this spectacle in your town
we got magic and voodoo and wicked clownz
if people dont like these juggalo's
you can take these nuts and juggle those
if your scared to sleep 
with your parents under the covers
i'll hex all three of you muthafuckas

but that don't mean i won't bitch smack that lip
we got full blood people ?

Verse 2:Shaggy 2 Dope
im shaggy the clown
and i dont give fucks

i picked your daughter up,never in need
dropped her off in the mornin smellin like weed

and every other rock band that stole my shit

and i'll kick your ass through your leather pants

and made your nutsac bigger than texas
and as you cry how fragile it gets

Verse 3:violent j &amp; shaggy 2 dope

that can only mean that it won't be long
