(Verse 1)
It could be the right time
middle of the night time.
Sip a little wine for the stress in tha mind.
Show you how I make mine,
Nobody could take mine.
Heard it through the grapevine,
but it really aint mine.
Never really was every time I get a buzz.
Shoot it to tha left like a real g does.
Yeah just say no but aint got a halo.
All I gotta do is lay low from the po-po.
Listen to the cholo, blowin up solo.
Holla at a playa we could hook up at the mo-mo.
Chill at the Ramada, do whatever you wanna,
Do whatever we gotta and never say nada.
Now you wanna sex me? Girl you wanna test me?
Girl you better know the whole world respects me.
Come by the fire, chill with a player.
How you admire these words thatll save ya.

(Chorusx2)

Stay with me, never leave
Stay with me, help me breathe
Stay with me help me be, help me be the best of a man that I can be

(Verse 2)
Now the moods getting righteous, baby dont fight this.
Move it like that, yeah I like this.
What about 4-play? Beat it up all day.
Will I still love you in the morning? Always.
Show you what I mean every time that I speak this.
You know what I mean girl; you know how to treat this.
Never be the one to put the lil in the mix.
You and me alone in the night? Shit.
Climaxin, body bakin, makin me high like Toni braxton.
Askin questions will I ever mention any lil secret?
I promise that Ill keep it.
Just go along with your cardio.
Just bring yourself and the bacardi on.
The rest is fine just keep the faith
just you and me thats all it takes.

(Chorus x2)

(Verse 3)
Now I feel the pressure think Im gonna measure
Every lil thing that we done to the bone.
Break it on down when its me and you alone.
Now its getting drastic every body askin
Is it really true? You my lil lady?
What you really think Ima tell em lately?
Tell em how I really feel about the deally
Tell em how I really feal about the kiddy.
What about tomorrow got about one time
Never give away whats mine right?
Most of these knickle bs
tryin to play a game with gs.
and that be the difference for instance
ever since this affair were both aware.
Its me and you and you and me.
Stay with me, stay with me.

(Chorus x2)</pre>
