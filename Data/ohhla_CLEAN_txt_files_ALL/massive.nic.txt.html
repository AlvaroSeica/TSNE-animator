{*whispered*} Shhhh, Alex Da Kid is comin

[Nicki] It's Barbie bitches!

[Interlude: Sean Garrett]
We got Tom-Toms over here bigger than a monsta
Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla
We got Tom-Toms over here bigger than a monsta
Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla

[Nicki Minaj]
Tom-Tom like in Lebanon, hotter than in Pakistan
Click click click, young Nick' the atomic bomb
Yeahhh, see it then you lick your tongue
Bet that, it tastes good, get you some
Wicked, got ten bad bitches
We sh-sh-shut it DOWN like the club got glitches - dig it?
And while you do that GT's pullin up, yeah
Spaceship, E.T.'s in the cut, yeah
P-pop a bottle just to get my head right
Tell the doctor go and get my meds right
Monster, you know it wouldn't be proper
if we didn't return with a big rocket launcher!

[Chorus: Sean Garrett]
Massive attack, mmmassive attack
Got them bomb bombs make the whole club go back
Ayyyy, bet the DJ gon' bring this one back
Ayyyy, like the swagger bomb bring on this track, ayy
Massive attack, mmmassive attack
What's been done done need no more say, that's that
Ayyyy, never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam all night 'til we see the sun

[Nicki Minaj]
So so hot in here feels like a jungle (yeah)
Me don't like boys that ain't jumbo (yeah)
One time bust a shot, for my champion girls
Tell them guys super-size me a combo
Kn-kn-know I got the ammo, that's why I bullet-proofed the Lambo
In the Middle East on a camel
Runnin through the jungle, Rambo, Liberace tango
Swingin on the vine, mango - mango?
So call me Simba little mama cause Mufasa couldn't stop her
Bitch I fly in on that chopper just to buy Balenciaga
It's just me, Mr. Miyagi and the Phantom of the Opera
Goin blaka motherfucker got that big, rocket launcher!

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Detonatin the bomb, detonate in the fire
Ros√© by the bucket, money makin attire
Detonatin the bomb, detonatin them hits
Fin' to buy out the bar, all my bitches is rich
You better duck when it comes, better duck cause it's comin
Best believe me you're on, g-got 'em runnin r-runnin
Now tell them rap bitches that Nicki said this
We got Tom-Toms over here bigger than a monsta!

[Interlude]
