[Verse 1 - Wale]
Yeah, m-m-mirror, tell me I'm the realest
Since all these other niggaz g-got gimmicks in l-lyrics
It's all gun bustin and such a lack of the subject
C-Could I be that nigga rejuvenatin l-levels?
D-D-Did I stutter, the missin piece of that puzzle
Feel like the only rapper that look at you with no trouble
It's easy on TV, make them believe what they be seein
M-Mirrors never lie, so they keep eyes up on they re-runs
For fear of what you show them, reality is golden
Real recognize real, you need some ID to be noticed though
One of the coldest to mix Pro Tools with your vocals
What the fans can't see, that m-mirror gon' notice, bet

[Chorus 1 - Wale]
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the realest of 'em all?
That ain't hard, swear to God, these niggaz ain't real at all
Mirror, mirror on the wall, is it right? Is it wrong?
It ain't hard, swear to God, these niggaz ain't real at all

[Chorus 2 - Bun B]
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the realest of 'em all?
They ain't hard, swear to God, these niggaz ain't real at all
Mirror, mirror on the wall, is it right? Is it wrong?
They ain't hard, swear to God, these niggaz ain't real at all

[Verse 2 - Bun B]
Say there Mr. Mirror, put yourself up to yourself and then
Just take a look at the reflection that's reflectin in
Your own physical, superficial, not spiritual
All them possessions you possessin, they can't keep your spirit full
You need to hear it fool but you don't wanna listen 'cause
You so f-full of your s-self and you just sit and judge
You point 'em out and call 'em up and then s-sit 'em down
Then you put fertilizer, lyin spread that shit around
But if you took a second Mr. Mirror you would see
That you just mad at you, man you ain't really mad at me
You took the hatred of yourself and just project it out
No disrespect, you can't respect yourself then just get out
For real you need to go away just like the +Rain+ song
'Cause you f-frontin and f-fakin it's just plain wrong
So Mr. Mirror man I'm just gon' keep it G
If you can't look up at yourself, how the fuck you lookin at me, mayne?

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3 - Wale]
M-M-Mirror, t-tell me she the realest
I met her in the club and she wouldn't let me in it
S-Seen her in a video, seen her in that magazine
See me I ain't frontin, we ain't seen them titties last week
Some find you nasty, f-f-fuck you call that?
I call it insecure, s-s-shorty think she all that
F-F-Fuck outta here, that's how they gettin gas
'09 gold diggers walkin with that different path
Find a dummy (wrap 'em up), let 'em fuck (suck 'em up)
Get in good, brings his chickens money, a-another one
No longer cab fare, with surgery and mascara
Lookin at your money but c-can't look up in that mirror
Fearin what it show you, reality is gold
Real recognize real, real women don't know you
One of the coldest, dancin on that pole
What them tippers don't see, I bet that mirror gon' show you

[Chorus 1] - 2X</pre>
