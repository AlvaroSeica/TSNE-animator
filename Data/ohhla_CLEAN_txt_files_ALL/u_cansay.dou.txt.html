[Hook]
You can say, whatever it is you wanna say
I'ma keep this shit popping, for my change
I ain't never stopping, for nothing mayn
You can hate, I ain't never gonna go bend or break
Cause I got, money to make
I got, money to make

[Dougie D]
When I wake up in the morning, my mind is all on my money
I got attention deficiency, if it don't pertain to it
I'm a grown ass man, working my jelly for my bread
Pimping my hustles daily, just to keep my baby fed
It's a lot of niggaz talking, and people they underrate me
Only thing that I gotta say, is keep watching me baby
Niggaz knock try to scheme and plot, and take me off my note
Since I'm peeping what they doing to me, it's gonna be on
But the joke's on you, you ignorant damn fool
I'm a man of many hustles, just like that boy Charlie do
If the conversation bout money, then fuck it Dougie with it
Just as long as it don't the system, then rob it jack it steal it
I'm a hustler by nature, if I want it I grind and get it
Niggaz can't tell me shit, about this gangsta life I'm living
Cause it's mo' money money mo', money money mo'
That's the mentality that I got, when I walk out my do' and nigga

[Hook]

[Dougie D]
Now everyday I'm living, it's like an obstacle course
Mashing hard for my feddy, cause being broke ain't my choice
If it's money in the streets to get it, I'ma go and get it
All that bullshit you talking bitch, Dougie D ain't with it
Keep my feet, planted on the pavement
24/7 3-65, I'm getting hated
But nevertheless see bitch niggaz, ain't never gon fade me
I got too much hustle up in it, just to let em break me
And that's the way it is, and that's the way that it go
I gotta stay on top of my money, and that's all I know
If making my money is a crime, then fuck it come get me
We ain't even gotta go through the trials, just give me my sentence
Cause the only thing up on my mind, is the dolla dolla
Keep my money coming in in bundles, and then come the power
All that other bullshit, stress and fame I really don't need
Only thing I need to see, is my motherfucking green
