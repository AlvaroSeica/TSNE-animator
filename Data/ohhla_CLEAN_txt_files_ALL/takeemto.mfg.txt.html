[MF Doom]
Ayo, Doom the super motherfucking villain
Chilling with my man the Grimm Reaper
Letting niggas know, all is fair in motherfucking war
Once more, all is fair in World War III
So Grimm Reaper, set it

[MF Grimm, Verse 1]
You want to stare at me, you want to glare at me
But I handle all beef, like American meat
I react, sneak attack, the gat Grimm packs
I click six, the nigs' necks catch wreck, and blow their wigs back
Mentally sick, battle rap is a jail pick
Blood on my knife, or either shit on my dick yea
Battle me and you're all dead, I'm taking niggas out with dreads
Blow outs and also bald heads, tracks
Straight from the underground dacks
Rappers step up or only end up in the stacks
Nine years it took, nine years of hitting books
Now I'm king of the crooks, making money like I'm Garth Brooks
Will I die? Who's to say?
My brain is the maze of death, so choose your way
Get burnt like a candle, very hard to handle
Do miracles in Nikes like Jesus did in sandals
It's a fantasy to beat me in fact
Mr. Warkentatoo would even have to turn their fucking backs
The Grimm Reaper's stats are known to lock up with the best
And after I test the best, I guess I'll lock up with the fucking rest
A girl battle I do the same
Tie the bitch up, and beat her ass like I'm fucking Rick James
In the minds of the insane, I'm in the hall of fame
Music equal murder, It's the same thing

[Chorus]
Cause shit ain't never gonna change
Fuck it, time to load the clips and we take em to war
Niggas wanna flip
Then we take em to war
Break a nigga proper
Then we break em some more
Cause shit ain't never gonna change
Fuck it, time to load the clips and we take em to war
Niggas wanna flip
Then we take em to war
Break a nigga proper
Then we break em some more

[Verse 2]
Bitch when it's time for me to go, no
As far as I'm concerned, I died a long time ago
Enter the mind of The Reaper if you dare
Man, woman, child, but bring a lot of clothes because you got to stay a while
Rappers come in loads, but left dead in piles
And floored like tiles, I beat down clowns
I wipe off smiles, killed a man for every inch that you can count in a mile
The master of disaster, killer of styles
I come from the streets, I represent the streets
I can never rape a woman, but I'll rape a fucking beat
If Donald Goines wrote my life my name would be Kenyatta
I don't chose to kill a brother, but to stay alive right now I gotta
It can never be harmony because of jealousy
Niggas want a piece of me, but my gun disagrees
Rappers all you know is talk
But when you come from the streets, shit all you know is war
And that's all I know, so, that's all you feel at my motherfucking show
Punk ass motherfuckers, know why?

[Chorus]

Die motherfuckers
The Grimm Reapers in the motherfucking house
The Grimm Reapers in the motherfucking house
For the undertakers in this motherfucker</pre>
