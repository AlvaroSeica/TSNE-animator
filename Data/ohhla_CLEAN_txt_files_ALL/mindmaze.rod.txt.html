[Intro: Cno Evil (Li-Mouse)]
Yo, Mouse, I heard about this new girl, man (what?)
I don't know, she said she raps and she wants to be on our album and shit
(Not our album) just give her a chance, man
(Yo, yo, what's this girls name, son?) Uh, her name was
Let me think it was ---

[KillahBeeHoney]
KillahBeeHoney, it's a pleasure to meet you
Don't be shy, put your hands out, I'm here to greet you
Not your everyday female, not in it for the money
No material shit, cause I'm that, one true Honey
When I rhyme, I never rest, roll with Cno and his crew
I learned from the best, so ya'll know how I do
Got guys on every corner tryin' to spit their game
Don't fucking talk to me, you can't even get my name
I hate those fake ass females, wearin' the wonder bras
Cause when they take it off, they wonder where their titties are
In the day I'm sweet and got class, in the night I'm a freak
I get my man in the bed, No Doubt, I whisper "don't speak"
Don't envy me, don't bother, when I spit, I spit that fire
No one can be as hot as me, the flames keep gettin higher
See me in the Brooklyn streets, walking without a care
Don't even dare to go there, like a Current Affair

[Cno Evil]
Oh shit, baby, I didn't know you had that in you
You really suprised me, with lines that shot through
I taught you well, went through the hip hop depths of hell
You came out strong, you can really rock those bells
Rap's first couple, on a rampage causin' trouble
Other bubble gum bitches, you can burst they bubble
Never dissapoint, always on point, on every single joint
Bring out the oils, and ointments, so we can annoint
K.B.H., Cno Evil, Mouse, party of three
Don't you agree, our rhyme debris, make 'em flee
See us on the marquee, right over your hotel
Farewell, to other belles, who impel hair gel
I excell with brain cells, cause, noble spells
Do tell, I crack shells, and eat well
Good job, Honey, now sit back and relax
Learn and watch the big boys destroy these tracks

[Li-Mouse]
Yo what the.. who the hell said that this shit was wack
Rush up on 'em and choke 'em out with these marvelous tracks
You couldn't imagine, how this shit sticks in ya mind
Make melodies in the breeze like we some, wind chimes
We incline, to the, maximum areas
Sledgehammer lines that smash through ya barriers
Your weak defense systems need to be repaired
You gettin mad, cause y'all hip hop mentally impaired
You bastards, get your shit remastered
Once your vocals hit the track it's a natural disaster
Loops that sound like cartoon sound FX
Box up your LPs and ship 'em out like Fed Ex
Yea, I put that in stone so you can't tackle that
That's real fact, like what you find on the bottom of Snapple caps
All ya'll cats travel back (back)
And get stomped out by my Wu-Wear Slaps (Slaps)

[Cno Evil]
Tag, the other member's coming in
White Plains, White Plains, my City's full of Sin
Gun you down like B. Willis, Tamias the illest
Even if you had a gas pump you still couldn't 'fill' this
Don't be mad, this is how we gonna win
White Plains, White Plains, my City's full of Sin
Gun you down like B. Willis, Tamias the illest
Even if you had a gas pump you still couldn't 'fill' this
With the strength of Mickey Rourke, I run New York
Get popped in your eye by New Year's champagne corks
With muddy boots on, I'mma stomp you all out
And lay down my dirt and scream 'fuck yo couch'
All day, my rhymes blaze, we don't play in the Mind Maze
All day, my rhymes blaze, we don't play in the Mind Maze

['Forrest Gump' sample]
Why you so good to me?
	You're my girl?</pre>
