[Intro: P.A.C. VA Streets]
Yeah, nigga, you know what it is, nigga
What you thought it was over, huh? You thought it was never
Ain't never over, ain't over til I say it's over, nigga
Ain't over til I feel safe, nigga, and you know what that mean
I ain't gotta say nothing, man, P.A.C. VA Streets, man
Illuminati Network in this muthafucka, man
Get at us, nigga

[Napoleon]
Right now, it's like me against the world, yeah I'm feeling like Pac
The beef cooking in the George Foreman grill and it's hot
They shot my man, son, took his life, raped his seed
Left him out in the cold, 38 degrees
It's getting real, the hood still shocked that he dead
Everybody really thought he'd get locked by the feds
But instead, them cowards put a glock to his head
Blew his brains out, left it fifty blocks on the bed
Before the hit, my man was the boss like Paulie
Everytime it was a drought, on the soft, he'd call me
And all pushes can't imagine all the soft you caused me
It's easy to snowman, but my boss was frosty
Now it's war, I'm sending all my men like Sosa
Dead or alive, your spend a night with vultures
I know all about your white Testarosa
Run but you can't hide, your life is over

[Chorus: P.A.C. VA Streets]
Everytime that you see me, just say what's up and keep walking
Don't get offended, I don't know you like that
I prolly got my hand on my pistol, go ahead and start it, I spark it
I let my killas lay your monkey ass flat
My niggas if it's beef then we riding, or we moving in silence
Creep, creep, homey, peel your cap
When them clowns least expect it, we gon' teach 'em a lesson
Now ya'll pussies better learn how to act

[Napoleon]
Word on the street, them cowards came back to the set
I immediately, founded all the macs and the techs
It's time we ride, sorta like Boyz-N-Da-Hood
When them dudes shot Ricky, Dough Boy understood
That revenge, was sweeter than the acid with crime
Not that we sued 'em, I still got to smack 'em with nines
The clock ticking, feeling like the end of the world
The plot thickens, he chilling in the Benz with his girl
I caught him sleeping, shoulda seen the look in his eyes
It reminded me of Frank getting juked for his pies
I made 'em beg, just to let him know he a bitch
We got to kill him, for real, cuz I know he a snitch
What up partner? Damn, did you shit on yourself?
Next time tell God he should of did it himself
I blew his dome, filled the Yankees fitted with shells
He got his wish, a first class ticket to hell, hell

[Chorus]

[Hook 2X: P.A.C. VA Streets]
The beef is on (boy, you shouldn't have done that)
The beef is on (now I'mma peel yo cap)</pre>
