[Trey Songz]
Ey ey yh yh
Yuppp!
Who knew we would be where we are here today?
Yeah
Who knew that your heart had a cost I would pay
Girl
Ain't gone be all peaches, I thought trough the pain you would stay
I guess... life is no fare no, no
Just listen to me, we can't go on
Pretending to be like we're so strong (strong)
Love (love), gone (gone), gone with the wind
I've got something to give to you

Yupp

[Chorus]
Black roses for this dyin' love
Now we're breakin' up
Since we're givin' up
Black roses and Early Valentine
Special delivery just for you and I

[Trey Songz]
Who knew our love would ever be
Called a memory
Who knew my home for happiness would soon be misery?
Hate that we're so distant girl do you even miss me at all
I guess... life is no fare no no no
Just listen to me we can't go on
Pretending to be,like we're so strong (strong)
Love (love), gone (gone), gone with the wind
I've got something to give to you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Can't sleep can't eat (no)
I can't erase the pain (no)
'cause I still feel your heart beat (yupp)
A million miles away (I can't)
I can't think, can't sleep (no)
I can't erase the pain (no)
Cause I still feel your heart beat (yupp)
A million miles away
I can't think, can't sleep, can't eat
Can't erase the pain (no)
'cause I still feel your heart beat
A million miles away

[Chorus]

Black roses, black roses</pre>
