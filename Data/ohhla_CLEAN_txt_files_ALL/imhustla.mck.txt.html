Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
And you a customer, and you a customer, and you a customer

[Verse 1]
I tell a nigga hurry up and buy
Like a Chinese man in a Chinese store
Well hurry up and die
You's a customer, see me I'm a hustler
You something like what's in the sewer, manure
While me, I'm just an entrepreneur, trying to pursue her
Cover all the fours, my nigga, you know I'm forced to
Try to just sell what I sell, you just come and buy
What you just try to buy, you ain't even got enough
To get to buy what you buy, you know
See me? I'm just tryina die in Dubai, you know
Where they got a few Bentleys for cabs
And all the bitches over there got ass and abs
Chyeah, what you doing passing them cabs?
Can't even pay your cab fare, ain't that cold?
I ain't have a jump shot like Telfare but I made sure,
That my mom went on welfare, you know why?

[Chorus]
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
And you a customer, and you a customer, and you a customer

[Verse 2]
You is a customer, you little tramp
Tryna come up in my store and buy shit with some food stamps
I don't take that, see that million dollar mark?
I can make that, nah I've been made that
You see that dollar bill you got, shit you could save that
I've been thinking, all I need is Ben Franklins
Since I was younger, nigga, I've been balling nigga
The type that hustler even when the set was crowded, nigga
I keep that fire, nigga and make sure that I could buy the proper tire, nigga
And since you is a customer that means you is an employee
And I'm the employer and now you are fired
You can just go and get your unemployment check
And I'm the type of man that demand my respect
A man with a tech is a man of respect
But a man like me, homie, I sign my own checks, you know why?

[Chorus]
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
Homie I sell a Bible to a nun
And you a customer, and you a customer, and you a customer

[Verse 3]
I sell a Bible to a nun, go to the war
Just make sure it's yours and buy him a gun
Straight for me shit I'd sell milk to a cow
I make shit if it amazes, say why
I probably could sell Jesus to the Lord
I'm a beast like that, see my life it was hard
So I learned how to hustle, I learned how to make grapes turn into wine
I learned how to steal, not get stuck by the vines
Like the thorns on the rose, I'm a beast like that
Out the trenches I done rose
See, I made sure that everybody in the hood had clothes
I'm the type that could sell Michael Jackson back his nose
I could easily make sure that you won't get frozen
If you was in Antarctica or in Alaska, plus I'll bless you
Shit, I could sell air to a nigga that got asthma, you know why?

[Chorus]
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
I'm a hustla hoe, I'm a hustla hoe
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
And you a customer bitch, and you a customer, bitch
And you a customer, and you a customer, and you a customer</pre>
