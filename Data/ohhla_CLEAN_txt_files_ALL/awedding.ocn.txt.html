[Intro]
Ahh~!
American love, American me
American you, American tear
American heartbreak
Oh ahh {*lighter flicks*}

[Frank Ocean]
I took a walk with the palm trees, as the daylight fell
Sangria in the canteen, talkin to myself
This tattoo on my left hand, is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ball gown, I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Gettin married in the courthouse, writing vows in a rush
Makin out before the judge, with my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done, that I just might die with

[Chorus]
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much, but we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, that's American law

[Frank Ocean]
M-R-S dot Kennedy, she signed her name in pen
In a fancy fancy cursive, then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic, virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands, those poor unamerican girls
After school she ran to me, jumped in my 5.0
This is the - home of the brave, land of the free
But your, parents still didn't know
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
So baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
before this goes way too far"

[Chorus]
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much, they don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, American divorce

[Frank Ocean]
Well you can have my Mustang, that's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ don't break my heart, this wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if youuuuu stay, oh if you stay (STAY)
You'll probably leave later anyway, it's love made in the USA

{*long guitar solo*} {*tape stops and changes at 6:12*}

[Outro]
Don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began dude
Ain't gon' be trippin over some bitch ass dude
They so vain I tell 'em this ain't you
You can get sensitive but the shit ain't true
These niggaz can't do nothin that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man I had a dream and then the shit came true
And nigga if I did it I think you can too
These niggaz can't do nothin that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man I had a dream and then the shit came true
These niggaz can't do nothin that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do...</pre>
