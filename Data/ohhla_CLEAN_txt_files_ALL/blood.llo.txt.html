[Chorus: all]
B, L, triple O, D
Trust me, whodie, you don't know me
B, L, triple O, D
Stay in some shit, keep the hammers on me
B, L, triple O, D
Don't fuck with outsiders, just my Stoneys
B, L, triple O, D
I pops the fuck off, that's why I'm O.G.

[Hemstone]
To be real, put it on the line and reveal
I got a knob grill, an odd way of dawning the steel
Blatantly, the love's lost through this whole ordeal
The opposite of discreation but it's way more real
The boy's a blessing, life lessons, be what you feel
Out of respect, we did it, so we do what we feel
Breaking bread's an expression, we ain't serving no meals
Looking over the order of things and this is not a drill
So what you betting, I like my odds in the seventh
Operate for high stakes, we overdoing destined
Beyond plotting, I'm long listed off the option
I send a doctrine to have your whole block knocked in
You losers locked in, while we open off this oxygen
Dimes turn to divas, and wont never bop again
Lost ovulance, it's over now, turn ya docket in
Broadcast the bad news, you lost with the obvious

[Chorus]

[Lounge Lo]
Aiyo, it's Bigalow O.D., now watch me O.D.
Welcome to the hood, where them cats be laying low key
The bloods be banging, the crips be crabbing
I'm in the back, of the building where them chicks be laughing
Getting gwop, skylining with homey, One Six Ooh
I does what I do, yes, for all my Stoneys
Like pop off, knock off, yessa ya top off
It's Drop City S.I.M.P.S.O.N., it's a must I drop off
And niggas don't believe, you know divas with no heaters
I'm in the two-seater, right outside food eaters
General Gem Star, you know the kid so picture me
Giving the kid, your only ten bars
That's Simpson son, all the way through
We gon' take it to the casket, run in your crib, slay
You and ya ratchet, and fuck you up up
All in the tee, with the team, smoking piff and the dutch dutch

[Chorus]

[General Gemz]
How the fuck do fake niggas claim king of New York
When the last time you see these faggots bang in New York
I make these cowards bow their head and kiss the ring of the boss
Thing about force, nigga, we don't take loss
It's that doomsday Stone, me and goons is home
I advise ya'll niggas leave the bullshit alone
We don't address you niggas, we undress you niggas
Kentucky rap cat, Rick Patino press you niggas
Get straight to the issue, boy-boy, the blood's official
Ripped through ya tissue ligements and boy grissle
You don't want the Stone to get with you, blow his whistle
No, referee, throw you two shots for free
Murder one, a/k/a A-One felony
It's that three time violent persistent
Rap with consistant, muthafucka, I wild in the instance
Don't get it confused, I get at you dudes
If you, seriously rude, I should of been food
I'm a five rider, livewire, live by the rules
Spit in my shoes, more than just payin' few dues
I does what I does, I was born to do it
This is, more than music, this is, murder unit
I'm more abusive, fuck it, no more excuses</pre>
