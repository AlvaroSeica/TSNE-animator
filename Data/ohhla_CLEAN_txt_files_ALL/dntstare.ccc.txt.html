[Hook: Chamillionaire]
Show a big timer love, when you see me ridin dubs
Platinum chain diamond up but Please Don't Stare At Us
When you know I see you, peepin me I'm peepin you
Find a better thing to do and Please Don't Stare At Us
Sittin crooked on the chrome with a throwed yellow bone
I'm with her and you alone, Please Don't Stare At Us
Ice sprayed on my teeth, deep freeze around my neck
Baby get yo mind correct and Please Don't Stare At Us

[50/50]
Mo' rocks than a dope fiend on my color changin ring
In my color changin car I got color changin screens
Somebody's watchin I feel them breathin from the sidewalk
Chamillion, when I park the car, passed when my men talk
Do not tug on my pocket and then bug me about it
'Cause if I got it to give, I ain't stingy I'll drop it
50 slash half a hundred, cash checks and stay stuntin
X-in my house with a gun to go get it like I'm huntin
Eat lunch on platinum plates, platinum knife to stab steak
Who said money don't grow on trees? I rake my yard with platinum rakes
Pause, hold up, stop wait it's what they beg me to do
It's either Platinum FUBU, or Iceberg with Pikachu
It's the 50/50 Twin, 23's when I spin
I say You wanna lick my chain? She say You tease me again
No key to the Benz 'cause it's voice activated
When my brother get off like I know haters have to hate it

[Hook]

[Paul Wall]
Here I come, turn your head, why your girl turnin red?
You remind me of the type of person that would turn Fed
Turn your frown into a smile, she don't like you take a hint
Turn the corner, everybody stare at color changin tint
Alot of money I spent to make, blind people squint
I tipped a waiter enough money to pay for his rent
I hauled away, listen how my horn be oinkin'
My diamonds got more points than a point guard pointin'
I'm babelous them sunglasses better cover your eyes
I drive past, jaws drop and eyebrows rise
I hold it down like sprint's mouth lookin like gold bricks
Lookin like stalagtites, hangin off my lips
I had aspirations of ballin ever since I was six
My record's like mosquito bites every DJ wants to itch
And every time people starin', at Paul Wall's mix
They call an ambulance to help them get they face unfixed

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
When it come to ridin chrooome, we some veteran pros
Matter of fact I'm livin larger than David Letterman's nose
Don't play stupid and act like I never said it before
I'd rather chase a set of them vogues, instead of them hoes
Whoaaa Kimosabe, find me in the Denali
Or hoppin' out the Impali, if ya sweatin it's probably
Not the damn sun it's cuz heat is strapped to my body
Whoaaa Kimosabe, think I'm bluffin then try me
Mirror mirror in the car, I'm watchin all of y'all
So I can see who's plottin on me when my twankies crawl
You starin at us dog, that boy Lu Hawk is not
The type to let some drama pop and just sit back and watch
Niggaz just sit back and watch, while we sit back in drops
Haters see more red dots than a kid with chicken pox
If you want it, its whatever you haters need to go get a
Life, we cheddar getters for 2k1 and forever
Whoaaa Kemosabe, get your dumb brain corrected
When you see a color changin necklace you better respect it
Uh Huh
