Song:   Anywhere I Go
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oh, I can do, anything that I can do when I'm with you
This Love, this love, this love, it's you I need and you i'm dreaming of

I never felt nothing like this [x4]

Anywhere I go I choose
Anywhere I go I choose to be with you
Anywhere I choose I go
Anywhere I choose I go but not alone</pre>
