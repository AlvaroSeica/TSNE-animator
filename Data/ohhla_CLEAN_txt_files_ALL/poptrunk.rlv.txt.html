[Intro]
"...feelings hurt"&gt; Prodigy
"Now act stupid, I'll pop the trunk"&gt; Redman
"Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt"&gt; Prodigy

[Chorus - 5X]
"Nigga!"
"Now act stupid, I'll pop the trunk"&gt; Redman
"Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt"&gt; Prodigy

[Larry-O]
It's gonna be a suicide goin' up against a army
Niggas get the wrong idea, like they can harm me
The Ebony Capone lightin' bless on the throne
My blow-out cleans in the sun like chrome
Livin' off the hustle blowin' my fuse
Bouncin' in and outta airports and cocaine shoes
The thug is on 'cause society failed me
When I creep through the streets
I take steps of death daily (Nigga!)
I never gave a fuck about shit
Now don't slip, 'cause I was disciplined from the hip
Or waistline like G-Rap I don't waste mine
I'm paralyzing punks, I'm loadin' nines on they spine
As soon as they drop, I boogy up the block
And count my c-notes wit Triple Beam and Dino
Now these is playas that's never caught guessin'
All-out hustlers, pimps in they profession
Y'all better know when you fucking with a pro
It's a serious thing duke, I gots to let you know...

"You get your feelings hurt"&gt; Prodigy

[Chorus - 4X]

[Larry-O]
Here come that big-time nigga
The slickest crime thinker (who?)
The sickest roots cannon, applyin' pressure on triggers
You better not move an inch or flinch
'Cause you was popping mad shit now let me see the bad shit
Fuck around, you best be ready
You petty, I make you motherfuckers hot as the Serengeti
I be the baddest motherfucker on this mic piece
Relentless lyricist, niggas hoping that I might cease
Or, slow down some
I...stimulate the mic like a tongue make a bitch cum
Sippin OE, living life to the T
Making licks for Lucci simultaneously
See mad niggas walk around with frowns (why?)
I'm shuttin' 'em down like clowns
A clean sweep, when I creep on ya clique
Like the Grim Reap
I freaked your technique rhyming in my sleep
Megatose and verbal venom combined
I drop you six feet deep with lines nigga, you get your

"...feelings hurt"&gt; Prodigy

[Chorus] - repeat to fade</pre>
