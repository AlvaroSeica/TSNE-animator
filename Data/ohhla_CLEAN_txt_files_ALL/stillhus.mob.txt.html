Hey man, what's up with them Steady Mobb'n niggaz man
Man them niggaz kicked off the tank man
P ain't even messing with them niggaz no mo', for real man
You know them SS's them niggaz had, nigga them was P cars
(why you all in my motherfucking bidness
Why you and your bitch pillow talking me nigga)
Man (I'm a real nigga), P pimped them niggaz
Them niggaz didn't get paid, them niggaz star struck

[Billy Bavgate]
I'm still hustling nigga, you might see me in the Source or the Vibe
Real niggaz do it live
Break the blunt down, cause I still get high
I wanna grind all night, to get my money right
I'm trying to catch, the Panama flight
The Puerto Rican mami's, looking real tight
Them bitch ass niggaz ain't right, they mad
Cause they can't live the thug life, and make the money like the drug life
I'm on the screen, making moves with ten figga niggaz
With a team, busters can't fade the king
I'm a Ghost town nigga, making moves with a beam
This is for the hustlers on the streets, niggaz feel me

[Chorus: Renzo]
We still some hustlers, we gon' ball till we fall
We still some hustlers, steady mobbing through it all
We still some hustlers, when our back is on the wall
We still some hustlers, tell them haters fuck em all

[Crooked Eye]
I'll be a legend till I'm gone, real niggaz feel me
I'm a soldier on this field, till you niggaz kill me
Call me Sosa Alfonso Crooked Eye
Frost bit wrists, fifty G's worth of ice
Use to slang ki's for the G's, by the zip
Rolled with killers, that kept fully's on they hip
You can catch me on the block, with my niggaz on the hang
I'm a made nigga now, still heavy in the game
Tank on my chain, don't mean I changed
I still bang to the boogie, and boogie to the bang
A mob style vet, I demand respect
And if you's reject, it's your chin I check nigga

[Chorus]

[Billy Bavgate]
Rich niggaz feel me, broke niggaz plotting on my loot
I need a gangsta bitch, to be my boo
Suckers can't enter in my residence
So they mad, cause we living like the President
I'm acting bad, I'm trying to live lav'
And put a little cash in my stash, so I can laugh

[Crooked Eye]
I push a BM, you still fixing on a GM
Residential, while we work Presidential
Bigger fig gas, we million dollar thug niggaz
Pay slots, while you living with pops
We down XO bottles, fuck all the models
Shake busters man, this is for the hustlers

[Chorus]

(*talking*)
Hmm, what's up Bavgate my nigga
These niggaz steady eyeing, got they eyeballs focused on us
(yeah man, I been kicking back thinking man
These niggaz all in our bidness man, they need to watch they bitch
That's who they got a problem with man)
Forget about they eyes, cause we gon' have ours regardless
(fa sho nigga, Steady Mobb'n till we fall, we brought the noise nigga)</pre>
