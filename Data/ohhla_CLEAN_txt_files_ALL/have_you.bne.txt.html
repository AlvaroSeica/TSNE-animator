[Verse 1]
Have you ever been lonely with the homies and hard lyrics
and tryin' To be fair, duckin' the Fed's
with a woman that be in the bed, with Another man
they complicate situations when you want you a friend
But baby my spirit is feelin', and I've been willin'
to meet you Right after the club, and to get the chillin'
my homies was tellin' Me that you lookin' real lonely
I told them they ain't ever lie They ain't phoney

[Hook]
Have you ever been lonely baby, I need love, I got something for you
To see number one thug, I'm comin' to take you back to my little telly
And spendin' my money for good grub in your belly..

Have you ever been lonely baby, I need love, I got something for you
To see number one thug, I'm comin' to take you back to my little telly
And spendin' my money for good grub..

[Verse 2]
We at the spot, gon' make it so hot
she said that she Puerto Rican Jamaican, make it drop
I know that she watchin' me hopin' she ain't Underage
you ain't dealin' with no sooth sayer, unknown stage
I'm Flippin' the page of this burgandy Holy Bible
she's sailin' me Readin' and then feelin' the big recital
I'm flippin' the television Watchin' the New Revival
so she don't think I only wanted her body For vile
I need a lot of help managing my little paper
I'm tryin' to Stack it up so baby momma don't rape us
and baby gon' hate us when We hit the magazine
but she called me a bitch, a coward, a fag of Things

[Hook]
You ever been lonely baby, I need love, I got something for you

And spendin' my money for good grub in your belly..

Have you ever been lonely baby, I need love, I got something for you
To see number one thug, I'm comin' to take you back to my little telly
And spendin' my money for good grub..

[Verse 3]
I've been walkin' and talkin' since the day that I can't remember
Wanna tell you my story about the 12th of September
I never had a Woman that stick through the thick and thin
don't make me bring my Baby momma, name up again
I promise to tell the truth, no matter how Much it hurts
you know that I can't hide from you boo you know I Am at work
I'm hittin' the dirt, could you help me take off my shirt
Don't worry 'bout my tattoos, baby I'm not a cur-few
but if I play The dog reliable German Shepherd
you only have to whistle while we Did it from the breakfast
my head is in the plate no hesitation for The da
man I can't wait to get my Scooby Snack, boo I can't wait

[Hook]
You ever been lonely baby, I need love, I got something for you
To see number one thug, comin' to take you back to my little telly
And spendin' my money for good grub in your belly..

Have you ever been lonely baby, I need love, I got something for you
To see number one thug, comin' to take you back to my little telly
And spendin' my money for good grub... in your, etcha etcha etcha, in
Your belly..

[Verse 4]
Now that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
I want you to take this fuckin' song In the club home boy

With some high heels, with a pedicure, with a pedicure
or some fine Legs, smooth, chocolate cocoa, mocha

[Hook]

Side step in the lake, side step in the lake
We are what it is
