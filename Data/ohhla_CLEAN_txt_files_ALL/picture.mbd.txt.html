[Mo B. Dick]
Sit right there.

Picture you and me in a six four
In the back seat smoking on some bud
There some freaky little things going on in my mind
It's another crazy night in the N.O.
Girl I'm really not trying to make you rush
But picture you and me making love sometime

I've been digging on you since the twelveth grade
Kind of shy, didn't know what to say
You turned me on like a light girl
Yes you did, yes you did
You were a friend but you became part of me
Back in the day I know that it was meant to be
Time's have changed, now I'm a grown man not a kid
So what I'm saying is

Picture you and me in a six four
In the back seat smoking on some bud
There some freaky little things going on in my mind
It's another crazy night in the N.O.
Girl I'm really not trying to make you rush
But picture you and me making love sometime

Girl I'm on another level everyday
Making money, everybody knows my name
There ain't no limit to the things I can do for you
No, cuz you've been down when I didn't have a dime
And on these streets you were my partner in crime
It's only right for us to do what we supposed to do
And if you, twose you have it all
Me and you baby ball until we fall
All you have to do is promise that you keep it real
Keep it real girl, I'll die for you, you die for me on everything
I'm your tomorrow, girl you'll be my destiny
Think about it, don't you doubt it girl do what you feel
And in the meantime

Picture you and me in a six four
In the back seat smoking on some bud
There some freaky little things going on in my mind
It's another crazy night in the N.O.
Girl I'm really not trying to make you rush
But picture you and me making love sometime

Picture you and me
Intimatly, total estcasy
Baby can't you see
I really want you baby
I really, really want you baby</pre>
