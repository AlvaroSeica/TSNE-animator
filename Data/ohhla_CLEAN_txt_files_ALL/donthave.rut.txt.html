Song:   Don't Have Much to Say
Typed by: A-Allah

[Intro: Apocalipps]
You ever lost someone?
you ever wish that you could just touch them again, or just see them?
Would you trade anything just to hear that voice one more time?
Well, all I have to give is this song, from me to you..

[Chorus x2: sample]
It's funny how things slow down..
It's seems that since you're not around..
I don't have much to say..
My smile has gone away..

[Truck (Apocalipps)]
Yo, I know its been years but how can I ever forget you?
Listen, when you left this world a piece of me left with you
I can't deal with these death issues
and Kleenex made millions on my tears on their tissues
It ain't a pen in this world that could write how much I miss you
I knew you was gone but I ain't know it was official
I'd give back all the eggs I owe just to hug and kiss you
It's funny how I been so down, since you not around
Instead of lookin straight ahead I'mm always lookin' down
I traded my smile in for a permanent frown
Dead and deceased, a grey stone reads rest in peace
Should I just leave it alone and let you rest in peace?
(Truck move on, let things be)
Go on with my life and forget these streets
Forget what we shared and how it used to be?
And all I got left is these memories
Swing low sweet chariot, comin' to carry me home
The spirit alone took me out of the zone
Now I gotta keep my head high, stay stong and hold on
A wise man once told me life goes on...
(Life Goes On)

[Chorus x2]

[Apocalipps]
Word up, I miss you
Every day of my life I could recall was a harder struggle
No one to run to when I got in trouble
Last words: I love you
Who would have ever thought I wouldn't see you again?
My problems grow as the world spin, another awful sin
An angel in plain clothing
You always talked about heaven, but every body ain't going
I've lost so many loved ones im surpised that I'm sane
Some type of chemical imbalance goes on in my brain
but I wish I could make it the same
and the hardest thing in life is accepting what you can't change
It's a pain that words can't explain
So young when you left, people said it's a shame
I think about you in the night and sometimes in the morn'
and I... think about you when this song comes on
You like the sun, when you out you shine without tryin'
and every thime it rains I know that you cryin'
I still feel you though...

[Chorus, followed by ad-libs]</pre>
