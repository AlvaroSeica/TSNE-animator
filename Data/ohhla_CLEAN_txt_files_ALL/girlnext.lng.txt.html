[Voice]
You're the same old girl who lived across the street
And you're the same old girl yeah
You're the same old girl who lived across the street

[Crayon]
I was in love with this young woman
Must've been wilding
I bought her everything
From clothes to the finest of diamonds
Along this ladder we climbing
Constantly running into problems
Trying to figure out and find ways that we can solve 'em
She said she needed space
Okay, I thought I'd go with the plan
Come to find out
She in the arms of her next man
Still love struck like a dumb fuck
And what it summed up
She threw my heart in the street
And hit it with a dump truck
Now I walk alone
With these suicidal thoughts
Drinking Henny by the quarts
Thinkin was it my fault
And my peoples say Ray look, forget about the trick
But I really wouldn't care
If I lay dead up in a ditch
That shit hurt!
If I was smart I would've seen it from the start
But nobody teaching brothers the dilemmas of the heart
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But yo I hurt inside
At night alone I'm shedding tears through my swollen eyes
And though she hurt my pride
I still got my mind
That keep rewinding my thoughts to better times
I'm having flashbacks

[Hook]
Prostitute (T-pot Stilletto):
-Hey daddy... I know you want me, but nothing in this world's for free
You gotta pay me. It's worth it
I'll let you taste it (moans)
Come here baby.. You don't got no money? Nothing at all?

[Rock Shabazz]
Stepped out the backseat of a car
Back under that lamp pole
Damp clothes from slight rain
Life's pains gives her migraines
Snuck her hand through her purse full of rubbers for some Tylenol
I recall, this girl was one pretty broad
Now she's cheap and sleazy like the New York Post
Sliding up and down poles all over New York's coast
In dirty basements
With thirsty patrons that's impatient
Giving payments to young pimps who push her down strolls
With other so called hoes
In Hunts Point, Queens Plaza or Pennsylvania ave
Where white suits come paying for ass
Never taking her math
Spending nights under sweaty men with diseases for cash
But these female rappers got her gassed
Sixteen showing her ass, talking trash
Scandalous on the ave
She laughs out loud at Captain Save-A-Hoes
Who ask if they could take her home
Take her to church and make her wholesome
Wonders if her neighbors know she's hoeing
Heavy perfume to mask her soul that's decomposing
Where is she going?
But the fact she's owning, the flyest clothes of the moment
Got her condoning, the fact she's boning
Niggaz she's not even knowing
On these dangerous streets
Ashamed to go home but one creep from laying six feet
Can't believe you the girl I pushed on swings back in pre-school
Got me worrying about you, whenever I don't see you

[Sample]
But now you running around, I don't know
But now you running around, I don't know
You're the same old girl who lived across the street
And you're the same old girl yeah
You're the same old girl who lived across the street</pre>
