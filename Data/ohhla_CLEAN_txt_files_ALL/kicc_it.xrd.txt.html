Y'all DJ niggaz know what's up
Play that shit
Yeah! get your hands in the air nigga
Come on!

[X-Raided: Verse 1]
Now when we first meant she was young and wild
But so was I starin at me with them brown eyes
What's on your mind?
Love, relaxation , blunts, drinks, and conversations
What ever happens after that its up to favorin
What you really lookin for?
You want man or a homie of a friend let me know
It ain't got to be complicated
We got to get a understandin so I gave what you demandin
Now what you really wanted was me
But who am I to disagree
But I got to wear a hat cuz baby might be dead
And we made beautiful music she even said it was mine
I was caught up in abusin it so I didn't mind
We was grindin in a slow motion
I let her have that milky white thick silky black baby makin potion
No emotions envolved
Ain't no love or hate
I just want them thick lips
Can we osculate?
Dark chocolate skin that only guys create
My mom ethatuated by a lie
They say I'm down with massagining
But I can't deny I love my mahogony

[Chorus]
Baby can we kick it tonight?
Maybe if you let a playa hit tonight
I may say
If lickin it right?
You crazy
I ain't wit it tonight
But if your kitten is tight
I just might baby
Baby can we kick it tonight?
Maybe if you let a playa hit tonight
I may say
If lickin it right?
You crazy
I ain't wit it tonight
But if your kitten is tight
I just might

[Verse 2]
Six months later when we going strong
Who would have thought weakened baby girl clickin like a metronon
Now I was wrong when I said I was gon hit it and quit it
Cuz baby girl got me fiendin and I got to admit it
You think I mean it
I love the way she do her thang
Keep me comin back to her like a boomerang
She blew my brain lookin at me evil eyes gleamin
She's a I see love demon that be drinkin my semen
And it's a to fight say we inceprable
She nothin nice and I refuse to let it go
She quick to loc up the daily green bud smoker
Deep throater never toker taste like mocha
A little vicious mairtricious five foot six
But I'ma ruggish hoodlum so we a good mix
I don't need no plantless little angel in my world
You got to be a little scandless to be daddy's girl
With that cinnamon skin that only guys create
My mom ethatuated by a lie
They say I'm down with massagining
But I can't deny I love my mahogony

[Chorus]
Baby can we kick it tonight?
Maybe if you let a playa hit tonight
I may say
If lickin it right?
You crazy
I ain't wit it tonight
But if your kitten is tight
I just might baby
Baby can we kick it tonight?
Maybe if you let a playa hit tonight
I may say
If lickin it right?
You crazy
I ain't wit it tonight
But if your kitten is tight
I just might
Baby can we kick it tonight?
Maybe if you let a playa hit tonight
I may say
If lickin it right?
You crazy
I ain't wit it tonight
But if your kitten is tight
I just might baby
Baby can we kick it tonight?
Maybe if you let a playa hit tonight
I may say
If lickin it right?
You crazy
I ain't wit it tonight
But if your kitten is tight
I just might</pre>
