Song:   Bin Laden (Remix)
Typed by: trenton.ray@gmail.com

"I want the world to know you won't beat us because were the children of
those who took the worst fall, of slavery and brutality that ever existed
Our parents survived the middle passage, only the strong got here
And then we lost our name, our culture, our religion, and were still here
So you may have a momentary victory Mr. Bush, but you don't know who we are"

[Immortal]
I pledge no allegiance, fuck the President's speeches
What the industry did to 'Pac they did to Jesus
Rapin' his vocals and destroying his message
Tryin to deport us if they can't destroy arrest us
Government front religious, but thier heart is empty
Like a televangelist preaching out of his bentley
Calling abortion murder in a medical building
But don't give a fuck about bombing Iraqi children
Talking like units in the fucking libretto
Look at thier mansions and look at your suburban ghetto
The gulag, the new hood where they send us to live
Cause they don't give a fuck about none of our kids
That's why blacks and latinos get the worst education
While devils run america like "Birth of a Nation"
Affirmative action ain't reverse discrimination
That shit is a pathetic excuse for reparations

[Chorus: Immortal + KRS]
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga
(Bush knocked down the towers)
Tell the truth, nigga
(Bush knocked down the towers)
Tell the truth, nigga

[Immortal]
They say that terrorism revolves around the Qu'ran
But that's stupid, I'll show you why its totally wrong
Cause if this country was invaded and crumbled
I'd turn Harlem into a columbian jungle
And I wouldn't be fighting for a Christian nation
I'd be fighting for survival from extermination
I wouldn't fight for Fox News, them racist niggaz
I'd be fightin for the hood, for the faceless niggaz
I'd be fighting for the immigrants america loves to despise
Even tho it needs them to make the economy rise
They feed us genetically modified garbage
So I repetitively reload the cartridge
Boston, New York, down to Atlanta
Guerilla war in the swamps of Louisiana
Camera panoramas of hammers couldn't rock me
East coast to West coast you can't stop me
And fuck Schwarzenegger, his pops was a nazi
And it runs in the family so run for the grammys
Run to the coon picnic and try to pick up a mammy
But half of y'all are faggots tryin to pick up a tranny
Eddie Murphy ass motherfuckers goin commercial
Even Interscope is gettin pimped by Universal
{?} sounds like green tooth lantern something {?}
But the Bin Laden slush fund remix just worked you

[Chorus]</pre>
