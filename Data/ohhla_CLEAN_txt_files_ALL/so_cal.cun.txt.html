[Intro]
How could she look at me and say, "I'm going..."
How could she break my heart without even knowing
She said that she was going home to South California
Go easy... ("Love California girls...")
Go easy... ("Love California girls...")
Go easy... ("Love California girls...")
And keep your cool ("Love California girls like David Lee Roth"
