[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo Ne-Yo, wassup son, what it do baby?
It's your boy Ghost, I need you to tell me something real quick
Check the joint, I'm single, right?
But you know I keep mad wizzes around me and all that
You know, and I'm not one to be fresh and all that, but I got my eye
on this one chick
You know what I mean? And I don't want to be bothered by them wizzes
like that, you know
To have the chance to be up under my wing though
You know what I mean? Lemme hear how you would handle the situation
real quick, hit me

[Ne-Yo]
When I'm single, it don't really matter who it is
Or how many I decide to kick it with
Long as she can understand how I do it
I'm a man with a very healthy appetite for chicks
But when I settle down, find a woman to live for
Still may be a couple cuties at my door
Thinking we could get down like we did before
And get mad when I tell them it can't be like that no more

[Chours: Ne-Yo]
Girl, though I got a girl
I just don't get down like that, I don't get down like that
You fine, baby you's a dime
I just don't get down like that, I don't get down like that

[Ne-Yo]
Understand baby girl I'm a totally new man
I don't live to crush as many as I can
No more, type of girl that changed my whole game plan
She the one, she the one, only one that I won't sin
And I know, girl I know, that you really want it bad
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted
All the things we used to do I knida missed it
There ain't nothing you can give that's as good as this

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Ayo I'm laid back on the couch, chain out
Watching the rain hit the window pane, my lotto numbers came up
Just last night I told my boo listen, take off your scarf
Gloves and hat, I got things I need to air out
See, remember that time up in the Grand Marquis
We was poppin made pain up in the grandpa suite
And in that night we made love, the phone rang twice
And uh you answered it, and you asked me who the bitch was
Stephanie, I met her at the coffee shop
Spare what you need, we connected from the gate, we popped
I swear to God there's no other woman that made me feel what I feel
See what I see, this girl brought chills to me
Uh, and the thought of losing you yo is killing me
Your baby's father be hogging, getting all my time
You see I love you yp, you my nigga for life
But if it wasn't for Scrams, word to my momma, you would probably be my wife

[Hook 2X: Ne-Yo]
Baby, all I can say is I'm sorry
Since I've found me my lady
Thinming about cheating would be crazy
I don't get down

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
