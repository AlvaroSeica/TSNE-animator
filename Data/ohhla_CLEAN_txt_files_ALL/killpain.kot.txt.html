Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Dirtball]
Time will kill the pain
Yeah time will kill the pain (I know time could kill the pain)
(Times Pass) Time will kill the pain (I hope time will kill the pain)
(Times Pass) Time will kill the pain (I know time could kill the pain)

[Chorus: Johnny Richter]
Times pass, here comes tomorrow
A new party, new drug, a pill to swallow yeahh
Feel no pain, kill all your sorrow
You lost your ways at the bottom of a bottle yeahh
Good times pass, here comes tomorrow
A new chance for you to change your ways and follow yeahh
Live your life, no need to borrow (time)
Wastin time isnt, time don't make us alright (Time could kill the pain)

[Verse 1: Dirtball]
This the type of vibe that will wash away the pain
Keep the fate, nor the rain on it's way
Clean us all, and lemme take whatever comes today
Turn into tomorrow and a brand new way
And let em all know, the fog'd never wanna clear
Without a positive and negative, stay near
Fence on a hill, sittin on a fence
I'm a twist it up, spark it, look into the sky
Doin show mile high, realize that I've known my pain, I'm always sedated

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Johnny Richter]
It's alright to be yourself and do whatchu wanna do
Go ahead and break all the rules as long as you stay true
As long as you know, and you feel it in your heart
There ain't nothin that could break it apart
The real is the real, and the fake is a fake
A ten be a dime, and a jerk is a jake
Some people leave and get their only replace
The sad times in their lives, dark voicing
This time will kill the pain (kill the pain)
Time will kill the pain

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Daddy X]
I know time would kill the pain (kill the pain)
No strain, there is no gain (is no gain)
I've been down the road before
Of losin hope, and wantin more
Look into the sky, needin a reason
Kinda makes sense when everyones leavin
Sometimes the good die young
And I'm just tryin to hold on
But I know, I know (this time will kill the pain)
Oh yes I know, I know
Time will kill the pain

[Chorus]</pre>
