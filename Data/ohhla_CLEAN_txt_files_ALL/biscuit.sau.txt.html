INTRO
Uhh, yeah
Cap Hill
Making all the honeys say "Ooh"
Making all the ladies say "Ooh"

   	"Check it, check it out now.  Check it check it out" From my start to your finish I'm in it to win it
Burn like carosene, all night sex critic
For now, wink with that eye brow, black cow
Faking surpise because you came with two tough guys
Seems like trapping this trick would be a dream
Putting niggas on my tab, now we on the same team
Boom, peep my words, saying it real simplistic
Reading your mind on some devil's advocate isht
I had to bag da biscuit
My protocol proving to penetrate, bait couldn't resist it
Play that sport right, player in the same night
Name, number, the works, you make wrong right
I hope, you're prepared for a very long night
Yo, it's on, what colour's your thong?  White
