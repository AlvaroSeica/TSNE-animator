Verse 1

Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
sometimes I love rhyming, sometimes it gets me sick
sometimes I wanna skip the struggle and just be rich
win the lottery or something or move a couple of bricks but shit
Sometimes I think about jail, when I get letters from my dog in the mail
sometimes I feel like I failed, because I'm eating, gaining weight
but my dude next to me is starving, staring at my plate.
Sometimes I wanna reach 'em sometimes I wanna teach 'em
tell the kids stay in school, study hard, live decent.
But I was raised in these streets
where either we moving keys, shooting threes or you weak
sometimes I think how long I been doing music
back when i couldn't get a beat CD from any producer
it makes me think about why I'm still doing it
sometimes it's for the children, they the future, other times it's for the loot
I know you looking at me wishing that you had my job
thinking 'oh it can't be that hard
to put words together and find more words that rhyme with those'
but sometimes at 5'o'clock I wish I could go home
you lucky
Well not lucky, but your life has simplicity, mine doesn't and I'm so contradictory
one day I wanna help, give to charities, spread out the wealth
Next day I wanna make it, spend it all on myself

Chorus

Sometimes I don't wanna be alone then
sometimes I wanna be on my own and
sometimes I wanna have me a drink
sometimes I wanna smoke and just sit there and think about
my life, knowing I'mma die, don't know when, don't know why
no I can't change, no I can't cry
but I sit and analyze a lotta things through my mind sometimes

Verse 2

I think about my people's division
vice lords, gangta disciples, blooding and crippin'
and would we be tripping on getting ice
if we was still out fighting for civil rights?
Sometimes I'm up at night, thinking bout my career
I wonder will I make it this year
sometimes I wish the label wasn't so scared
of making something like this a single, but in the club this ain't what I wanna hear
some rhymes I wanna be like Mos Def and Kweli
another verse I'll sound like MOP
God listen to me, does poppin' at people that's hating on me
mean eventually it's meant that the devil is waitin' on me huh?
There's days I'm quoting biblical scriptures
other days I walk around toting militant pistols
I spot a happy couple thinking ooh i want a commitment
but then I see a fat ass and think I want someone different
Sometimes I want a ho sometimes I like to trick
sometimes I want a woman sometimes I want a chick
sometimes I want somebody I can really kick it with
other times I want a girl that won't say shit
I really wanna bless you wit knowledge
You wanna vote? I want to break down thee electoral college
but who the hell cares? I'll just tell you some garbage
like bust guns, stack ones, sell drugs
hit the club, that'll get you much farther you know

Chorus

Verse 3

Sometimes I wanna be so famous I can't go to the mall
sometimes I don't wanna be noticed at all
I wanna fall so deep in love I forget other broads
but then I get a phone call from a shorty wit no drawers
sometimes I want a smart girl with a nice brain
other times I just want some nice brain
or a light rain then a bright sun
sometimes I wanna have a daughter or a bright son
it don't matter, sometimes I want a Benz or maybe a Cadillac
sometimes I wanna turn back time and bring Daddy back
sometimes I want real estate, stocks and property
other times I'm on some nigga shit chains and watches
pieces and bracelets, half my budget on colored diamonds
with the transparent setting I told you I'm sometimey
sometimes it's Benihana's
sometimes it's Wendy's, McDonalds sometimes I'm making you dance
other times I tell you my problems

Outro

Sometimes I feel up
sometimes I feel down
Somedays I feel like I still wanna get around
sometimes I wanna be mainstream
Other days I'm underground
Wanna be on the big screen
Next day don't wanna be found
Some days I don't wanna wake up
Some nights I can't go to sleep
At times I wanna be myself
Other days I don't wanna be me</pre>
