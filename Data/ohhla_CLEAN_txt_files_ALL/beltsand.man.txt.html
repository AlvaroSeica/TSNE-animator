Belts, Boot And Rodeo Hats

Well he's a real live wire
......And he's coming your way
He'll be getting there from everywhere
....And leavin' any day
He's a man that's on a mission
Being guided by the sun
But he won't get off that curcuit
.......'Till his ridin'
days are done
He's got a pony named Mona Lisa
.....And a four by four by Ford
And he knows how to ride the big time...
....Keeps comin' back for more
But that won't hide the cowboy in me
This is the way it is oh yea

[Chorus]
I've got the belts, boots and rodeo hats
Tell me little sister where it's at
I wanna ride the pony's with a broken back
In these belts, boots and rodeo hats

....Here we go
Well there a heaven up above 
........For those who can wait
And a hell down below
.....With a bull
horn on the gate
And there ain't nobody gonna tell me how to get there
Cause I've been to hell and back and everywhere
Oh Oh and I've seen the sunrise when it wasn't so good
And I've seen all those bad girls in your neighborhood
But that won't hide the cowboy in me
....That's just the way it is

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
He'll be waking up with strangers
..And talkin' to himself
It's a lonely old life
...In his
one room hotel
But he'll take that trailer eastward
...Or where-ever he goes
And where he winds up 
...Well nobody knows yea yea

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

Let him go....Watch him ride...
Till he's long, long, long gone honey</pre>
