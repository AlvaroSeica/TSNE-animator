Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm a show you wayne gretski
Hunned grand show so you never disrespect me
A nigga fuck around I'm a show you who the bitch be
Bitch I'm based God I don't need you to accept me
You're not from the streets bitch I saw you even check me
Then I came back, then them niggas started to respect me
I'm a young cool bitch and them suckers really
I'm really bout that life, in a fucking oakland...
Fuck that, they can't fuck with me
Product of the block, I was raised down on 6th street

Hater ass niggas hate on me but they love me
I don't give a fuck, I'm thugged out, bitches keep playing
You feel me?
I'm the based God, last time I heard
I was the man around that fucking God
I don't give a fuck, I still got the world
Fucking with the mac, I'm a take you to that world
Pink flame mixtape, I don't know if the world ready
It's time to take over the world</pre>
