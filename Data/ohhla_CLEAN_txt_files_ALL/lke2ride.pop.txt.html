[Intro: Lady Raw]
Niggas, where my thug niggas?
Where my real niggas?
Where them real niggas?

[Chorus: Lady Raw]
I like to ride it, ride it
You like my body, body
You wanna lick it, lick it
Stop, tongue and play wit it
Lay me on my back, don't stop, get it, hit it
Dig it, pull out the hair, throw it up
I like it rough, throw me on the floor, daddy
Aow, tear it up

[Lady Raw]
You wanna lick me up, lick me down
Lick down, get down, all around
I like the big big boys, with the big big toys
Hit a rhyme, make a whole lotta noise
And ah, whip cream in the whippin 'a
Handcuffin ya, no touchin her
You got to work it out, only with the mouth
Make it bounce to the south, scream my name out loud
Reach the floor, only Raw, allow stick the tongue out
Got 'em open, got 'em all turned out
I like it rough nigga, tear the club up
Grab my hair and throw it up, while you diggin the gut
I be squeezin ya butt, I like to ride
Throw my shit from side to side, to get 'em open wide wide
Cuz I just wanna...

[Chorus]

[Lady Raw]
Phat flows, phat doughs, phat clothes, whoa, look at 'em stare
Wit they mouth open, when I brake it down, and shake it around
And open they keep scopin, hoppin to hop in the rizzo
Only if you go down low, lick the twat, like you do in the watch
If not, get no hot botch, you got a 4 inch dick, gettin no props
I like cocks hard like Rockwilder
Spread my knees on the floor and make me holler
Where my niggas with the cash dollars
Like to trick, I like to lick, take ya dick
Can you put your hands on it, lighten suck
Scrawn him up, half tilted, push the 5
And stay gettin high, why, cuz I just wanna lick it

[Chorus 2X]

[Lady Raw]
Iceberg in a icener
Doorag in the pants, nigga
All my bitches scream "aow", if you like them hard niggas
Two five and a nine milla, Jaguo' and a Benzo
All my bitches scream "aow", if you like the money getters
Six pack and an eight pecker, corn braids in the reasoner
All my bitches scream "aow", if you like them thug niggas
Chocolate in the butter love, honey in the strawberry
All my bitches scream "aow", if you like them freaky niggas
Stickin they tongue out, got 'em open, got 'em all turned out
Yeah I like to rough nigga, tear the club up
Grab my hair and throw it up, while you diggin the gut
I be squeezin ya butt, I like to ride
Throw my shit from side to side, to get 'em open wide wide
Why? Cuz I just wanna...

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Lady Raw]
Aow, tear it up
Aow, tear it up
Aow, tear it up
All my freak niggas
Oh, tear it up
Oh, tear it up
All my thug niggas, wit they ass attention with this
Tear it up
Tear it up
All my witches, all my ride bitches
Aow, aow</pre>
