Artist: Omni
Album:  Burgundy Brown
Song:   Freaking It Well
Typed by: iamomni dot com

cause were gonna keep it funky for you
cause were gonna keep it funky for you
cause we gotta keep it funky for you
and we always

you better come correct, and check your ego
omni got respect like bald eagles
build with my peoples like egyptians
elbow to wrist, lyricist
learn languages, travel the world
and live dangerous
everything's a matter of time, we focus and apply pressure
it's beautiful, business is pleasure
even if I don't make it big, I'm like whatever
ain't no feeling like putting an album together
start from scratch, I make shit match
add a little bit of scratch and this and that
think about the things I can do with a rhyme
I get high and watch the time fly till the high tide
blowin' weed smoke out of taxi cab windows
I got one night to find something to get into
you might see me backstage chillin' at a venue
I do this shit for real homeboy, I don't pretend to
talk at the speed of thought, watch what I say
I can paint a picture perfect, put me in and press play
I got money on my mind and time on my hands
got product in the street and at popular demand
moving units to the public out the back of mini vans
if you rollin' with me, c'mon let me see them hands

chorus:
you freakin it well, you freakin it well
you freakin it well, yeah, you freakin it well (x4)
C'MON</pre>
