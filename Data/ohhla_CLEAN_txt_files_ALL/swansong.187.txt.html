[Chorus 2x]
Sometimes I can't sleep at night 
All that I witnessed in life
Nightmares of being a killa
Because I am off on the hunt again

[Verse 1]
Yeah, Uh, Nightmares of a cold killa [Cold killa]
Hard to look at myself in the mirror
[I hate myself] Hard to get a grip on life
When everything is killed or be killed, Fool ever wanna pay the price
My pops taught me how to cock the hammer back [Cock the hammer back]
Aim and squeeze and lay a motherfucker flat
[Boom] I'm a son of a gunna
Got a great reputation for trippin and kickin up a bunch dumber
I wonder, Will it ever change? 
Will I wake up and find somethin else to erase the pain?
Seein pops get murked got my mind tweaked
It's like I'm trapped, It's stuck on repeat
It's deep, How life can throw a curveball
Ya gotta suck it up and accept how the chips fall
And it's hard to deal for reala
A Swan Song, Nightmares of a born killa

Chorus 2x

[Verse 2]
Uh, Yeah, They say revenge is better off served cold [Served cold]
And when they catch the Black Swan, Then i'll truly know
Word has it that he's spotted out east
Atlantic City to be exact tricking hella cheese
[I'ma get em] And from New York, It was a quick route
Vengeance for my father is all that I'm thinking bout
Hit the Casino and surveyed the place
Plan out in my mind what I'ma do when I see his face
I'm anxious but I gotta think straight 
Broke in the security room and reviewed the camera tapes
Now it's time to scape 
Got the scoop on the room he was staying in 2538
And my blood's boiling more hotter
All I'm thinking on this mission is revenge for my father
And the tension's getting mo thicker
A Swan Song, Nightmares of a born killa

Chorus 2x

[Verse 3]
Uh, Yeah, Uh, My body filled wit a bunch of hate
Mind flowing off fears and anger, Hard to think straight
It's like the sun after the rain
Maybe when I kill the Black Swan it'll kill the pain
[Or maybe not] Gotta slow down and evaluate
Cause when the shit pops off I gotta make a clean break
Took the elevator to the 25th floor
Perp like security and knocked on the door
A bad bitch opened the door
I rushed right in, Cased the room, She asked who I was looking for
The other bitch jumped up scared
Hella shocked, Cause I had the heat to her head
Uh, Told the bitches I was looking for the Black Swan
They kept bullshitting stringing me along
I guess this mission was a big miss
I shot em both gangsta style cause I don't trust a trick bitch

Chorus 2x

And I'm off on the hunt again
Because I am
Uh, Yeah, Uh

Listen Paul
As your Attorney, I have to tell you things the way they are

[Paul]
Yeah

[Attorney]
Unfortunately, This Judge Longhorn character
Has the absolute worst reputation in the nation 

[Paul] 
Ah fuck

[Attorney]
I mean he is a damn monster Paul

[Paul]
Aw

[Attorney]
You are facing serious time going before this man 

[Paul]
Fuck!

[Attorney]
And our hands are tied on this one

[Paul]
What the fuck Blackwell? My father will pay anything
I mean we will do whatever it takes at any cost
And you know what I mean
I can't go to fucking jail, You have to know a way out of this man
You always do!

[Attorney]
I might know a guy. I know one guy
He's just now returning from some personal business in Atlantic City
He's been working a lot but if the money's right
He can make this thing go away
Truthfully, He's your only solution here

[Paul] 
Fuck man! What's it gonna cost us?

[Attorney]
Everything</pre>
