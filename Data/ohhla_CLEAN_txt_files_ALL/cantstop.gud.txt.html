Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Poetry emotion, flowing like the ocean
I was down now I'm up like ten Viagra doses
I'm the future, spittin magic, voila, hocus pocus
Copperfield a object, here's to put the plan in motion!
Big money for the hosting, double up for the show
Tell the promoter I want the back in before I hit the dough
That's how I got the gold boy, cash on delivery
Pay me for my bars, I mix with my delivery
Underrated, trying to get paid like a superstar
Still a street nigga, I gave the pistol to Scoopa Skull
Not a ball player, never plan to be a hookin star
Can't stop now, keep it rolling like a moving car
LAT is who we are, ease on a mission
Speakin everything that we believe into existence
With the grind I'm persistent, my mind's like a Smith &amp; Wesson
Shots pop off in every session, nigga!

[Chorus]
No response, conversation sounded funny
It's like they told me stop getting money but (I can't stop)
But learn from your mistake
Yeah I know, but it takes time
Gotta keep a weapon off the waistline but (I can't stop)
Reaching you peak, automatically it takes grind
Even on the corners in the daytime! (I can't stop)
Million dollar dreams I done seen trying to make mine
Don't even comprehend the word breaktime cause I (can't stop)

[Verse 2]
Nigga, I'm plugged like 18 sockets
All homo ass nigga, trying to raid my pockets
While I'm big and back booling about to lace my broccoli
I could tell my blood brother get him ASAP Rocky
Reporting from the East Side of the boondocks
I crank it in your hand of your boom box
This not hip hop, when that 2 pop
Get it? When that 2 pop!
Let's rock &amp; roll while I'm puffing it strong
I'm getting white boy high as I bump the remotes
I've been going in since my baby momma water burst
Niggas got the hands out, I gotta feed my daughter first.
I live by the beat, I live by the beat
Like you live check to check!
So if you don't move your feet then I don't eat
So we're like neck to neck, so nigga I can't stop!

[Chorus]
No response, conversation sounded funny
It's like they told me stop getting money but (I can't stop)
But learn from your mistake
Yeah I know, but it takes time
Gotta keep a weapon off the waistline but (I can't stop)
Reaching you peak, automatically it takes grind
Even on the corners in the daytime! (I can't stop)
Million dollar dreams I done seen trying to make mine
Don't even comprehend the word breaktime cause I (can't stop)

[Verse 3]
Make no Statue of Liberty for me
Trying to see the grand statue of Liberty on the key
Let freedom rang forward
Point council brought the pill in the freedom ring
Missin writin rhymes, committin crimes, trying to free the team!
Broken on and tumbling
Hail Mary, I stumbled into something that could take the percution out of your suffering
Stuck on being stubborn, heartbeats are flooded with don't kill
I'll leave a concussion and cut your jugular
Bitch, I'm going out my mind, I ain't going in
Come on pull the motherfucking stomach, I could throw it in
Poster big, poster kid, we're nothing alike
Supersonic coop on Monday, pourin lean up in the Sprite
Look who leaning to the right
Rubber band Shorty
Know it's got a name, but I don't know what to call it
Can scorchin the iron, heat steamin, free shootin
Nobody, tell a nigga, eat you!

[Chorus]
No response, conversation sounded funny
It's like they told me stop getting money but (I can't stop)
But learn from your mistake
Yeah I know, but it takes time
Gotta keep a weapon off the waistline but (I can't stop)
Reaching you peak, automatically it takes grind
Even on the corners in the daytime! (I can't stop)
Million dollar dreams I done seen trying to make mine
Don't even comprehend the word breaktime cause I (can't stop)</pre>
