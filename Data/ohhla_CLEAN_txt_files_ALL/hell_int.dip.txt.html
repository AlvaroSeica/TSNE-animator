Razor buck 50, cafeteria slammin shit in niggaz face

Lights out niggaz, killin niggaz that's rattin
and ALL that crazy shit nigga!
Holla at them nigga Rell, spit for these niggaz out there locked up
Let these niggaz out here hear, what the fuck you talkin bout
ummmmmmmmmmmmm hmmmmmmmmm.....

[Hell Rell - freestlying over phone]
I said yo
From around the time when B.I.G. first got on his Coogi and Versace shit
I was uptown buyin coke on my ?metapapi? shit
Like, "Listen Pedro, this aint good yayo
Give me my moula back
or you'll be the first +German+ I point my +Luger+ at
Y'all better take it easy
Yeah you hot but, that's because it burn everytime you take a pee-pee
Stare at the chain too long bet he be blind
When it come to that dope, I tap dance on it like Gregory Hines
and fuck what you heard this the real Rell
They could give me time for throwin the whole clip at you
I'll be back down on a appeal bail
The flow, airtight
If Jesus turned water to wine
you can turn that ho to a housewife, yeah right!
And everything in check like a pair of Air Nike's
We like to jump niggaz, never had a fear of fights
You take bitches shoppin, and take em out to eat
If they aint got a place to stay, then you take em out the street
All I do is be dressin them hookers
Before you know it
got them bitches on the strip, with the rest of the hookers
And nigga I did the crime, I ain't gonna cry about this time
or hold no grudge with the judge
Just shackle me down, put me up North
Send me to my cell, long as y'all dont fuck with my food or my mail, I'm 
good nigga
Before you know it, I'll be back in the hood
with my hair wavy leaning back in the Mercedes
Screamin, "Look what the FUCKIN pennitentiary made me!"
Thugged-out heartless and crazy, shit!
I didn't shoot niggaz for nothin, they was beggin for that
and I didn't make the fiends buy it, they was beggin for crack
DipSet, bitch!

[Cam'Ron]
Yeah nigga, you'naw I love you
That was crack right there, Rell!
I love you, nigga it's nothin

[Hell Rell:] I love you too my nigga
[Cam'Ron:] Everybody love you, nigga
When you come home we got you, aight my nigga?
[Hell Rell:] No question homie</pre>
