[Gemstones]
If we can break down those walls to set you freeee
we would, cause we out heeeere...
And we miss yooooou...
If we could build a ladder that tall to come and see yoooou
we would, cause we down heeeere...
And we miss yooooou...
 
[Sarah Green and Gemstones]
If we can break down those walls to set you freeee

And we miss yooooou...
If we could build a ladder that tall to come and see yoooou
we would, cause we down heeeere...
And we miss yooooou...
