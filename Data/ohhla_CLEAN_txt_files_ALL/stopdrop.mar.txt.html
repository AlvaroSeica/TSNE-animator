[Chorus]
Early in the morning it's all good to
Stop, Drop and Roll
And in the evening it's all good to
Stop, Drop and Roll
When the lights go out (When the lights go out)
It's all good to Stop, Drop and Roll
Cause when were hot, Deceptikonz
(5X) Stop, Drop and Roll

[Verse 1]
In the mornin' I woke up frozen and my arms are now broken
If you look closer you will notice that my shoulders fold in
it's too much stop, droppin' and rollin' since I took up aerobics
movin' my hips side to side and in a circular motion
cause I'm doing all I can just to lose some weight
tryin' to feel healthy and get in shape
ain't know what the feelin like feelin' great
shave and buzz and ?

[Verse 2]
My turn let me rip it up
To the horsemen giddy up
don't try this at home please give it up
see my drinks at the bar come fill it up
you not feelin' us? we don't give a fuck
fools wanna bring it, I pay for your mini bus
work your skill your styles not fit enough
cocoanuts with the little ?
how does it feel that your fans would rather ??
catchin up to all those ahead of us
champions in the game like we never lost
move back is the woof pack (oooooooo)
Stop, Drop and Roll

[Chorus]
Early in the morning it's all good to
Stop, Drop and Roll
And in the evening it's all good to
Stop, Drop and Roll
When the lights go out (When the lights go out)
It's all good to Stop, Drop and Roll
Cause when were hot Deceptikonz
Stop, Drop and Roll

[2X]
Deceptikonz we don't mind if you stop drop and roll
come on girlies make us lose control

[Verse 3]
Hey girls daddy's home
back with the ? of rappers ?
still melt plastic rappers though
like you cats were like Michael Jackson's nose
catapult, cause stakes is high
so what tastes you gimmick is a waste of time
deface and throw you lyrics in the lake of fire
and this ain't even the way I rhyme
take my time, you should know now
forcin' is the way it goes down
? knows the name through the whole town
Deceptikonz stop drop and roll out

[Verse 4]
Never rap sober, ????
make way it's the stop drop and roller
get drunk off some Burbon and cola
pass out on a comfortable sofa
smoked out it's the low seed smoker
Again, jumpin your boys who are men by the ten
one hit, to the chin
one girl, one move I'm in
I keep it on the D-Low
I don't wanna freak though
I just wanna ride to get home
but no she wanna learn to stop drop and roll

[Chorus]
Early in the morning it's all good to
Stop, Drop and Roll
And in the evening it's all good to
Stop, Drop and Roll
When the lights go out (When the lights go out)
It's all good to Stop, Drop and Roll
Cause when were hot Deceptikonz
(9X) Stop, Drop and Roll

[2X]
Deceptikonz we don't mind if you stop drop and roll
come on girlies make us lose control</pre>
