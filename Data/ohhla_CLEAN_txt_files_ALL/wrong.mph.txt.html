[Verse 1]
Fearless, she jumps in the deep end
Works hard all week, cuts sick on the weekend
Girl likes to party hard with her free friends
No drama so it's easy to keep them
She's seen men come and go
Dreamin about them runnin home
The love's below the poverty line
Cause her head and heart, they commonly divide
Sunshine ain't so bright for the night owl
But it's easier to fuck with the lights out
Quiet down, you pretty little fire flower
Waiting for the burning bridges to die down
Might've found that whole life in that one night
Could've been that one shot in the gunfight
But she confronts none with her tongue-tied
Heart of winter and a head full of summer time

[Verse 2]
She kept it simple with restrictions
No more than four nights was the limit
This way, sure to keep the walls in distance
Each visit slowly losin its difference
Done did it for the basic fact
That that fabric wanted that friction
Till one guy interrupts the routine
Brings back old feelings, push forth new dreams
Eyes met amongst a nightclub blue screen
Late night hype between two human beings
Amusing scene for the sceptics
Both with wounds soothed by disinfectant
Conversation connected like none before
Come and get it, they both wanted more
She felt the funk in feeling unsure
Head said never but heart said once more

[Hook] {X2}

[Verse 3]
Thinkin that he's two steps ahead
He heard lies aligned with her heavy breaths
Caught the vibe of she ain't really ready yet
She might be tryna hide behind that heaven sent
Smile - outspoken style
With the best intent, her effect is intense
Been in love, no longer believes in it
Cause she cheated and they mistreated
Devoured the hours that he needed
So keep eatin that trail of treats
Eventually we'll find where the trail does lead
But who gives a fuck what it really means
As long as there's a little lust to feed
He ain't the man amongst the thieves
Heart had a plan but his head said to leave
Must've been smoking on a pipe dream

[Hook] {X2}
