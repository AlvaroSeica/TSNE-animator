[Intro]
Hey John (yeah)
John, turn me up in my headphones (okay)
Uhh John, John it's too loud
(Oh okay wait) John (wait a second)
John turn it down (wait a second)
J-John, John are you there? (Yes!)

[mc chris]
Well my name is mc, I'm like no other
A short-sized, high-pitched, white-skinned brother
And when I say white yo I don't mean pink
Cause my skin's about as white as White Out ink
When I step into the sun, burst into flames
like the Human Torch, no lives to save
Said I, don't go to clubs, and I, don't go to raves
And I, don't go to pubs, and I don't go to parades
So where do I go, you might call a hooch parlour
If you don't know the password don't bother
It's where all the ladies leave their lipstick on my collar
But I tell them to be gone cause all they 'ant is my dollar
Mahler, uses to write symphonies
Name is mc and I claim to be
Star material like astrology
Punk rock, hip-hop, and R&amp;B
Watch me blend it up like a daquiri
It's why all the honies be mackin me
Ah-waitin in the alley, sneak attackin me
Tearin off my clothes, ass smackin me
Back when we, didn't have no record deal
Still managed to make the ladies squeal
Word up... and you knowwwwwwwwwwwwwww

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Name is mc, shout it back to me
At the count of three, 1-2-3 (mc!)
Say my name is mc, shout it back to me
At the count of three, 1-2-3 (mc!)

[mc chris]
Name is mc, drivin 'round in my C-I-V-I-C
I see you girls walkin by, lookin fly
Soft to the touch like a porcupine, blow my mind
Name's mc, me multiplied
Don't call home cause I'm out tonight
I taste real good like pumpkin pie
I only smoke the pipe when there's skunk inside
Can it be?  Her fingers slippin down
My L-E-V-I jeans
I be so happy now, without a doubt
Like I just smoked an ounce, fucked and bounced
What the fuck you be talkin 'bout
mc backwards cotton mouth
Not on the mic, I'm kickin yo' ass at Balderdash
Yout can't stop me now, you can't stop me!

[Chorus]

[mc chris]
Ah-well my name is mc, I come from a place
Called L-I-B-E-R-T-Y
V-I-L-L-E... in the place to be
With a Lil' Bo Peep eatin edamame I'm eatin Chick Filet
Get up on the mic and stay for days
Drunk off that Citron lemonade
And a little bit of Tanqueray {*slurring*} but I'm okay
Eyes wide, stir fried like Vietnamese
Adam and Eve, aho as we please
With nothing but a bucket of ice up my sleeve
Ask Mr. T and the fuckin A-Team
A beam in your face, mc chris in the place
With a mouth full of toothpaste
Library book paste the due date
So many hoes I get the group rate
You're too late!

[Chorus] - minus shoutbacks</pre>
