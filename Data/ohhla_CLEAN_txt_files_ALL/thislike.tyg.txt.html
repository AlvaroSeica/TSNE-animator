[Robin Thicke]
All white linen, ridin 'til the sun comes down
See that we livin like whoa-oh-oh

[Chorus 2X: Robin Thicke]
This is like ridin, through the city
with the ocean in the background
This is like flyin, in Paris
What your girl say now?

[Tyga]
Uhh! B-side, baby parlay
Waterfront top back, Coupe with a fade
Tonight is ours, paint the city red ru-by
You lookin fine, beautiful as one could ever be
Tires spinnin, fast cars, fast women
And I just wanna get a night with a happy endin
The yacht life, get it splash, so much class
Lift your glass, make a toast, we around the map
His and hers, Hermes bags, left the tag
All real love shit, with a scrub
Chillin on top, get away, just a flight
Livin life, this is what it's like

[Chorus]

[Tyga]
Uhh! She's so relentless
Body of a Goddess and I gotta take her higher
Rain through my window pane, she the fire to my flame
Good aim, put your heart where the sky is
It's cold down there but it's lonely up here
The world's so cold you gon' need a Montclair
Don't mind stare, when I look at you it's all clear
Tryin to keep it together and ball like Rothstein
Four Seas', car clean, Harleys
I'm from the gold era, my jewels is Gili
A party ain't a party if it ain't all night
Livin life, this is what it's like

[Chorus]

[Robin Thicke] + (Tyga)
Like no film that you've ever seen before (yeah)
This is like a penthouse (you know what it's like)
Served at the top floor (so we at the top floor, ha ha)
This is like love, that you can never get (can't get it)
from nobody else (nowhere else baby)
Whoa-oh-oh (yeah)
This is like whoa...
Yeah this is like whoa, this is like

[Tyga]
All John Blaze, collar shirts, school days
On stage, a hundred thou', two days
Looking down on top from where the stars stay
Reservoir and back guards in the entry way
I'm young and wildin, I charm a old mother
Invited your young daughter, I'm known across waters
Horse in the stable, Ferrari cause I'm able
Whole life I've been waitin, now this is like

[Chorus]

[Tyga - over Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
We do it all day, ha, hair blowin in the wind she say
To make her feel like
Right next to the ocean
Young, Money

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
This is like flyin {*3X*}
This is like ridin, this is like flyin
This is like, this is like, this is like flyin
This is like love...</pre>
