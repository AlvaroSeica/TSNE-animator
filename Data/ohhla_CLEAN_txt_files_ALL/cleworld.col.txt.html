[Intro - J. Cole - talking]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night
A hell of a night
So we can do whatever you like, hey, hey

[Verse 1 - J. Cole]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, it ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flatterin but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate, asked me if I gained weight
I said "nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all"
Money was an issue but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle, take the proceeds, go to gamble (ha!)
Bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then, I could pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealin with some real-life shit
She be askin "when?" Bitch, When I feel like it

[Chorus - J. Cole]
Cole World, cold life, cold blooded
I be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it
Got a hundred-fifty bitches in the club starin at me
How that feel? Very happy

Hey, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here
I got, I got what you need right here, right here, hey

[Verse 2 - J. Cole]
Uh, turn up the 808's for me (woo!)
Back when I was starvin, no one made a plate for me (woo!)
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story (woo!)
I got the type of shit that make a hater say "sorry"
Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin Belly
Eatin peanut butter, jelly, what the fuck can niggaz tell me?
They say I'm takin long, I tell 'em patience is a virtue
I'm goin all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See when you're spittin so real
Suddenly these phony niggaz lose they appeal
Got 'em feelin like my niggaz when they lose they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue my niggaz ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wondered what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be

[Chorus]

[Outro - J. Cole - talking]
Hmm, okay we outta here (o-o-o-okay-kay-kay)
I think it's safe to say we outta here (we outta here, we outta here)
We outta here (yeah, yeah, yeah), I think it's safe to say we outta here

I think it's gonna be a hell of a night
A hell of a night
So we can do whatever we like, hey</pre>
