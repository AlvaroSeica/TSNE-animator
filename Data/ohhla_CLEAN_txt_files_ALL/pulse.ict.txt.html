[Verse One: Ice-T]
Just checking my microphone once as I test your audio
Increase the bass response, hoping the speakers blow
I got no time to sit and flip and pop bullshit
Turn up your stereo hops, insert the rhyme clip
Close your windows up, make sure it's air tight
E.Q. the track exact, so shit sounds right
I rhyme of death and darkness and danger
Your crib or car becomes a torture chamber
I lace my rhymes with violence, what you expect?
Sounds of pain, the snap of a broken neck
All alone in darkness, I sit each night
Write my rhymes with blood upon a butcher knife
You say the Ice is ill, and ill I am
They try to ban my shit and I don't give a damn
Roll up, your eye will get swoll up
Suckers who flexed, yo, their deaths got tolled up (Hold Up!)
Cause I'm not the nigga to toy with, boy with the big mouth
You got time to riff? - there's time to take you out
Put a couple caps in your ass, cut your head off
Send it to your moms with flowers cause I'm so soft
Lay on your whack crew, smoke the whole bunch
Bury them in my backyard, and then I'll eat lunch
Cause I don't give a fuck about you, or him or her
Whenever I'm in the house; a death just might occur
Is this real or fiction? - you'll never know
While you're locked to the pulse of the rhyme flow!

[* Beat Break*]

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Once I lock you up, you can't get loose
You stuck your head inside then I placed the noose
The mic drips juice slow from the steel mesh
My words feel like hooks underneath your flesh
Making you twist and turn, scorch and burn
When will you learn? - the Nineties are my turn
To pitch a vocal fit, like the ultimate
Gangster rhyme, yo, I invented this shit!
Watch me do it, as I do it and I do it right
Grab the gauge, duct tape on the flashlight
Don of the black Ski Mask can come to your house
Cut off your power, and do you with the lights out!
Is this real or fiction? - well you'll never know
While you're locked to the pulse of the rhyme flow!

[* Beat Break*]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
A pool of blood and floating body parts would make me grin
A close view of a razor when it's breaking skin
If you were burning, I'd use gasoline to put you out
Cause I walk alone, and choose the dark route
Nightmares gotta be loved by some, and I'm the one
You wanna come, bring your shotgun
You ever seen your partner die? - No, Well I have!
You ever seen your father die?  - No, Well I have!
You ever seen your mother die?  - No, Well I have!
So shut the fuck up, punk! - and clear the rhyme path!
What would make feel calm and nice is a slow slice
Through your jugular and windpipe
Throw me in jail, I won't even try to make bail
Put me in the gas chamber and watch me inhale!
Is this true or false? - well you'll never know
While you're locked to the pulse of the rhyme flow!

[Verse Four: Ice-T]
Chasing, tails of the Crib in the Darkside
Another fly murder, another suicide
Did these flicks have an influence on my brain?
I really doubt that shit, I think that I was born insane
When I was young, I had a lust for knives and guns
Use a magnifying glass to fry an ant with the sun
And on and on my lust for death got bigger
At fifteen I was placed behind a trigger
Although I'm dirty, not the one to be swept up
Step up, I'd love to open your chest up
I've got no concept for life or death
Flexing my hands on your neck, all I want is your last breath
Give me a motherfucking break, I should behave
Give me a motherfucking shovel, I'll dig graves!
I break ill in extra large portions
Where's your parents? - I'll make you an orphan
So when you're talking crazy, you better think of me
The I, to the C, to the E, to the fucking T!
There'll be no screams, no tears or cries
Just a laser beam between your fucking eyes
You feel strange, so now you know
That you're locked to the pulse of the rhyme flow! Flow! Flow!</pre>
