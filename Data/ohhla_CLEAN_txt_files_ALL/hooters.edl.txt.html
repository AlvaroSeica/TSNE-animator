[singing]
Hooters, I love them hooters
Can I get a tooter on your hooters
I love them hooters.. oahhhohhh!
	(Tootin on the hooters, tootin on the hooters)
Hooters, I love your hooters
	(All I wanna do is keep tootin on the hooters)
Can I get a tooter on your hooters
	(Tootin on the hooters, tootin on the hooters)
I love your hooters
	(All I wanna do is keep tootin on the hooters!)

[Ed Lover]
Hey yo baby got back, it's fat and alla that
But I'm about to take a different route on this track
Cause breasts is the best thing, next to the wet thing
And if it is a sex thing, check it how I wreck things
They call me horny, perverted even nasty
Cause I never let a pair of big ones pass me
See - hooters it don't matter to me
I'll take a 36C or a 42 double-D
Damn!  That's how I jam when I slam
You never knew before but now you know who's the man
I am - so keep your girl away from me Hobbes
Cause I flips and lose my grips when I see ya in a tank top
Stop - this ain't no secret garden
She had chest like Dolly, I beg your Parton, she me hard an'
oh my God I ride her like a scooter
But to put her in the mood I need to toot upon the hooters

[singing]
Hooters, I love them hooters
Can I get a tooter on them hooters
Girl your hooters.. you're hoo-oooh {*scatting*}
	(Tootin on the hooters, tootin on the hooters)
I love them hooters
	(All I wanna do is keep tootin on the hooters)
Can I get a tooter on your hooters
	(Tootin on the hooters, tootin on the hooters)
AhhhhhhhhhhhhhhoahhooohhahhH!
	(All I wanna do is keep tootin on the hooters!)

[Ed Lover]
Now, I've.. been a lot of places and I've been in many cities
And in each and every city, I go crazy over.. 
Tootin on the hooters, yeah you heard what I said
I get jealous when I see a little baby gettin breast fed
Check it out, I love everything about 'em
I'm goin to the top, you'll never catch me at the bottom
Restin on the chest gives me chills
I ain't goin DOWN-TOWN, I'm goin over the hills
But f'real, I got a bad habit
Everytime I see a pair of breasts I gotta have it
You know, women nowadays really got a lot of nerves
Walkin by with those big juicy loosy curves
BOW-WOW-WOW and a RUFF-RUFF-RUFF
I got four girls, but yo +Eight Ain't Enough+
Cause I'm obsessed, with the big fat breasts
And if your ain't got chest then I couldn't care less

[singing]
Hooters, I love them hooters
Can I get a licker on your hooters
{*scatting*}.. oahhhohhh!
	(Tootin on the hooters, tootin on the hooters)
Those hooters, I love them hooters
	(All I wanna do is keep tootin on the hooters)
Can I get a tooter on your hooters
	(Tootin on the hooters, tootin on the hooters)
I love them {*scatting*}
	(All I wanna do is keep tootin on the hooters!)

[Ed Lover]
Yeah, hooters over here - mm, hooters over there
I'm tootin on the hooters anywhere, I don't care
The bigger, the better, the fatter, the greater
Cause like a piece of candy I can suck 'em +Now or Later+
Milky, cereal baby, you know the flavor
I'm tootin on the hooters like a pack of Life-Savors
Little hooters?  Damn what a pity!
I don't need a smitty down with the itty bitsy tittie committee
Don't get discouraged long as you've got your own
Cause I damn sure don't want no phony silicone
But then again, it is a horrible sight
when a woman takes off her bra and she got two mosquito bites
on her chest, where's the rest of the breast?
Hon you look a mess, please put back on your dress
You gotta understand that I gotta stay true to
the game you know my name I like tootin on the hooters

[singing]
Hooters, I love them hooters
Can I get a tooter on them hooters
{*scatting*}
	(Tootin on the hooters, tootin on the hooters)
Hooters, I love them hooters
	(All I wanna do is keep tootin on the hooters)
Can I get a tooter on the {*scatting*}
	(Tootin on the hooters, tootin on the hooters)
	(All I wanna do is keep tootin on the hooters!)

[Ed Lover - over singing]
Now throw your hands up in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like a girl that got a real big pair
let me hear you say, oh yeahh-ya!
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you ain't got a flat chest, and you don't look a mess
ladies say, oh yeahh-ya!
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if your chest like bare then you need a big pair
let me hear you say, oh yeahh-ya!
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you ain't got a flat chest, and you don't look a mess
ladies say, oh yeahh-ya!

[singer]
