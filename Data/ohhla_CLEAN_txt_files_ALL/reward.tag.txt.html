[Verse 1]
Made a promise to momma to make it out the hood
and follow up on that promise to make it out for good
goin' strong for too long, no excuses
where it's a way there is a will like who produced this
I'm tryin' to make a livin' off of rhythm
chase dreams, catch up wit' 'em so I can live 'em
If I'm supposed to pay for the sins of my father
well, that's a lot of repentin' prayin' God forgives him
accordin' to the system I should be dead or in prison
but I missed that memo to carry out that mission listen
word to my daughter though her mother know
I've been far motivated before that water broke
limit is the sky, I'm aimin' at where the stars go
prison time when it comes to the pen and bars so
call up the warden, this here is a portrait
through scripture, yet in the form of recordin'
they love me overseas I need to be world tourin
and I want that car foreign pedal to the metal floor it
see it's the Lord's plan I'm just the informant warnin'
you that I'm here to win I'm reapin' all thats' rewardin'

[Chorus]
If it's no risk, no reward
It's opportunity in this world, create yours
It's room for you to be you, that lane's yours
What you waitin' on a chance for, take yours
(repeat 2x)

[Verse 2]
As I listen to Marvin, playin' on my song list
from I come apart to what's goin' on with
this industry I'm in survival of the strongest
If I ain't hip hop, then what do ya call this
Shit I'm still an artist starvin
but the game mattered less when I became a father
As far as recordin' I was like why bother
but I come this far I gotta show my daughter
That you must work smart, earn every dollar
Hard work pay off, and that's word to Mahd
and day and night I gotta send up response to God
cause he navigatin' this ride see I just drive
But I'm part of elite starfleet watch me fly
I clocked in to put in work, now watch my time
I'm Here to bring balance walkin' that fine line
of reachin' the mainstream without compromisin'
and remain genuine and try and keep it honest
if I don't sell my soul, can I at least go Gold
prevail is the agenda, so indeed I go
I'm on a place kicker's mission to complete these goals
and that's real

[Chorus] (repeat 2x)</pre>
