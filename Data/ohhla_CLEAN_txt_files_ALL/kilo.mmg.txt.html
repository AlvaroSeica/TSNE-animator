[Intro: DJ Scream] + (Louie V)
This the legendary DJ Scream talkin' to you
Self Made 3, The Untoucha..-BLE
Maybach.. Music Group (yeah, we was really sellin' that powder, nigga)
This a gift to the street - accept that (yeah)

[Chorus One: Louie V Gutta]
I used to pray to get a kilo, a kilo
36 O's up that route for my amigo
Throw it in that water, watch it swim like Nemo
Man I swear to God I pray to get a kilo

[Chorus Two: Louie V Gutta]
Then I got a kilo, a kilo
Better keep that on the low if you got them kilos
You might get booked or get murdered for that kilo
Now I'm steady getting money and this ho wanna fuck cuz she know
I got a kilo - she only want me cuz I got em bricks
She only want me when I got bricks
Before a nigga I ain't had shit
She only want me cuz I got kilos

[Meek Mill]
Cause I got bricks... cause I got shit
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up - TURN UP!

Kilos all on my neck (my neck), these niggas ain't no threat (no threat)
Sky gonna go with our plane (our plane), and I ain't comin in no jet (yeah)
And all I want is straight cash (straight cash), I ain't even takin' no checks (no checks)
Cause these hoes don't do credit and they don't pop pussy if the money on debit
I got them kilos - she only want me cause I got bricks (cause I got bricks)
She only want me cause I got shit (cause I got shit)
Before a nigga I ain't had shit
Man she only want me cuz I got kilos
36 O's in the pyrex (WOO), I be going HAM in the project (WOO)
Got a bad bitch with me and she all that (WOO), she ain't nothing but a jump shot, all that (swish)
Ya'll second grade fires like arches, I make a brand new flow, you can burn that
Selling all these bricks, need a hard hat, I hit your ho one time, never call back
Say these chickens used to wanna be like Mike (Mike), now these niggas wanna be like me (me)
And these hoes twerkin' on Instagram (gram), still talkin like they wanna be like Bey (Bey)
And these dudes yall say getting money (hah), lookin' like groupies in the VIP (hah)
And if these dudes got all this paper cause all these niggas wanna be like me, HO~!

[Chorus One]

[French Montana]
HAH! HAH! Ay, ay, ay, ay..
You ain't got enough on me nigga (hah), 44's tucked on me nigga (bow)
Long nose like Ginobili nigga, 5 rings like Kobe nigga (bling!)
I was flippin kilo after kilo (after kilo)
Rockin that Versace shit way before Migos (Migo)
Started with them dams at the project with a stack
Then I flipped it to a brick and then I did the Project Pat (hah)
Like, homie what's the problem? Save me or revive em
Catch a nigga with the bricks, you know we goin' rob em
Once I caught the liquor we was fresh up out the drop
Man the bitches on the corner watch a player like the scout
I said all I wanted was a kilo (kilo), all them bitches wanna free load (load)
All I wanted was a drop with the head cracked like Cee Lo (WHOO)
36 them O's nigga (hah), thousand grams on gold nigga (hah)
Power plants at the broke nigga (hah), BC, coke boys nigga (hah)
Army come, pistol on me, smoking on California
10 chains, catch pneumonia, yea...

[Yo Gotti]
Ain't no refunds nigga - wanna get your money back?
Best bring your guns nigga - and no receipts in the streets
All sales, you know they found a nigga; so if you lose some then it's your loss
If you don't way up then scale off, if you trap right it'll pay off

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]</pre>
