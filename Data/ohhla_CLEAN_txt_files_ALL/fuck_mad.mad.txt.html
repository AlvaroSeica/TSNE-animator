[Madchild]
Rappers talk like felons but they're all fake villains
Madchild 'bout to erupt like Mount St. Helens
I don't give a fuck if I hurt your feelings
Get your helmet cracked, I'm a silverback gorilla
Yeah~! This is quantum physics
+Little Monster+ will stomp on you daunted midgets
I've lived a life full of wrong decisions
I got condoms for conjugal visits
with blonde haired midgets, monsters, mongrels and wizards
This is on-going, I'm throwing bombs in a blizzard
This is calculated long division
I got a strong condition, my funds are insufficient
It was a really fuckin long intermission
Now I'm goin all out, and I ain't askin for permission
While I gather up my arsenal, you couldn't wrap a parcel
You're a harsh farce marshmallow with a arsehole
I don't wear bar clothes, I'm not gettin a bar code
tatted on my arm bro, you couldn't hit a barn door
My aim's perfect, it ain't worth it
Perfectly wired circuitry, hurt you like I'm Hercules
Then paint my face cause inside I'm a dark circus freak
Lurkin through the forest with a black axe handle
Wax candles, droppin acid drinkin Jack Daniels
A masked vandal, I'm a victim of a bad scandal
The Mad's Rambo, commando in a black Lambo'
Used to gamble back when my head was scrambled
Now I'm Foghorn Leghorn eatin a hambone
Playin in a jamboree with a tambourine eatin a tangerine
A backpack with a change of clothes and couple cans of beans
Wait I sounded like Yelawolf there, I wonder if he'd care
He seems like a pretty good guy, he probably won't mind
So back to bein Madchild, opposite of fragile
People think I ought to rat style, fuck Madchild

Fuck Madchild man! Fuckin ex-fuckin junkie
Who does he think he is?
Tryin to come back and have a rap career
Isn't he fuckin Canadian? He's not even allowed into America...</pre>
