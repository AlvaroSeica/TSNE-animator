Goin kamikaze
Goin kamikaze

No way out
No way out

Have somethin in your life that you would die for
Someone you would die for

[ VERSE 1: Penhead ]
Yo, the war never ends, I'm in conflict
Drama's a constant, the world's a hostage
Ghetto and projects, streets flooded with narcotics
Violence plagues my knowledge of self and my pocket's health
Drug-dealin buildin clientele, killin fiends
The American Dream for many is a nightmare
I write lightyears ahead of my competitors
And hit the game's pressure point
Who dares to join me?
My warning of a communist country shall haunt those who don't take heed
Speak bravely, face the enemy with audacity
And a credence for my street niggas
[Name] Nation, baby, stationed in HBG
Rep my city faithfully, death awaits us all
Staying taller than the laws of the land
Fall to my knees, pray to my Lord, it's out of my hand
Some things aren't meant to understand
Never planned to be a wanted man
The system got the upper hand on me
Where my faith can be determined by a grand jury
Still I stand firmly, cowards can't journey
With me, they're worthless
The mission recquires faith and courage
A terrorist spirit hovers over me
Speakin in peace through my pen
I'm unworldly, Lord have mercy on those
Who sacrifice their life in the name of what's holy

[ CHORUS ]
The sky's endless, I fear nothing but God
Kamikaze spirit, dyin for a cause
What I risk my life for, you probably couldn't see it
(Against) the same spirits that crucified Jesus

[ VERSE 2: Penhead ]
Weed makes this insanity tolerable, I'm in solitude
Mentally my ministry is the arsenal
In this political war I manifest my spiritual call
Which was transported through the umbilical cord
Why fear death, it's a part of life
Just a next dimension where the laws of physics are defied
When worlds collide then you see reality's a mirage
An imagination created by God
Try to sabotage my knowledge with trickery
Liberty and justice for all, you must be kiddin me
Now this homeland defense security
Cause they ignored the threats, all behind economics
Didn't take into consideration the innocent lives involved
Left Americans brainwashed, not me
I seen it comin, somethin was bound to happen
Too many niggas gettin murdered by accident
In the ghetto know you reap what you sow
In some form or fashion, you're not special
America's dark past is slowly catchin up with us all
United we stand, united we fall
Watch who you let to write your laws
It could come back to haunt you
The spirits of Pentagon could eventually transform into communism
And if so, catch me on a kamikaze mission

(You gotta snatch some collars and let them muthafuckas know
you there to take them out, anytime you feel like it
You gotta get the ground beneath your feet, partner
get the wind behind your back and go out to blaze if you got to
otherwise you ain't shit
You might as well be dead your damn self)</pre>
