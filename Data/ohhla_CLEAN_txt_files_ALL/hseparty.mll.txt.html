[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 

[Verse One: Meek Mill]
I tell her meet me in the bathroom, I fuck her while the water runnin
Her friend knockin at the door and she screamin out I'm comin
And my youngin in the other room, fuckin up my sheets
She tell him boy don't grab my hair because you fuckin out my weave
I got a hundred bottles, Ciroc Boy ('Roc Boy)
All my jewelry 'cause it's fun I'm a Hot Boy (Hot Boy)
All these stones in my chain made me a Roc Boy (Roc Boy)
And I heard you niggas talkin money you should stop boy
I fuck bitches by the group, I get money by the pound
French Montana on these niggas chop-chop-chop-chop-chop 'em down
E'rytime I'm in the club, these niggas is not around
E'rybody talkin money I say prove it not a sound
SHHHHH! White girls!!!!! Gone wild!!! (Gone Wild)
We don't judge 'em though, they ain't on trial (On trial)
Bad bitches (Bad bitches) Got 'em on dial (On dial)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Welcome to my house party-party!!! Welcome to my house party-party!!!  
Welcome to my house party-party!!! Welcome to my house party-party!!!

Packed house it's hot as shit she tell me that I'm cooler though
