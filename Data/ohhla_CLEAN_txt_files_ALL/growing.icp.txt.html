the jump off one summer night I noticed my shoes was fittin wrong
my feet was all the sudden a half an ich too long
I jumped in my car and though "now who the fuck was in my seat
fuckin with my lever and re-adjustin my mirrors"
I stopped to get a slurpee and I noticed I was floodin' in my jeans;
getting back in my car, I split my ass seam
my shit ain't hardly fitting anymore, fucked up detergent or
I'm growin bigger than motherfuckin dinosaur
got out the car and had to duck to get in shaggy's place
you should have seen the fuckin look up on his painted face
he said "holy fuckin shit, I don't know if you knowin
but you growin and it's obviously showin, homie"

[Chorus 2X]
watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down
watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down
and now I'm growin again, and I'm growin again
now I'm growin again, and I'm growin again

the next day I woke up, shaggy's three dogs were trippin on me
laid out on his couch a smooth nine foot three
they don't fuckin love me no more, I stand up
and put a hole in shaggy's ceilin with my big ass nug
the dogs ran, shaggy's like, "holy fuck, don't move!
first thing you gotta fuckin do is do not move!
we need to get you out the house before you fuck my shit up!"
I had to crawl through the hall into the front yard, then get up
I'm lookin through the eyes of a twelve foot tall man
don't feel any different though I could use a tall can
I'm growin every hour and the reason's unknown
now I'm sitting on your home with my feet on your lawn, damn

[Chorus 2X]
watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down
watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down
and now I'm growin again, and I'm growin again
now I'm growin again, and I'm growin again

to me, SUVs and sedans, they're like pop can
a little bit heavier but tin in my hand
shaggy's chillin on my shoulder in a custom made basket
"i'm tryin to ride with my boy in this bitch, and outlast it"
I try to stay in one place, it ain't no use in hidin
hella choppers beamin with coppers on all sides
and the media, government are offerin jobs
world press, scientists, all swarming with this mob all around us
"fuck it J, you only gettin bigger, dog
you and me, right now homie go for a jog
we've been sittin here lettin them observe us and for what?
I say you tell 'em fuck the world and throw the lotus up"
now I'm runnin, every step is 32 miles
shakin' the earth, turnin buildings into piles
and I'm runnin, crushin trees like blades of grass
my head's above the clouds, all they see is my ass
and I'm runnin, 600 mile an hour wind gust
footsteps explosions, three day of dust
and I'm runnin' I can still hear shaggy on the megaphone
"keep keep keepin' on! don't stop! come on!"
and I'm runnin through states in two step or less
through the oceans, and don't even be getting my nuts wet
and I'm runnin, finally gravity took me away
I ran right off the planet into the black of outer space and I'm runnin

[Chorus 2X]
watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down
watch where you fall down, watch where you fall down
and now I'm growin again, and I'm growin again
now I'm growin again, and I'm growin again</pre>
