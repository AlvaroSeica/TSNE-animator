Song:   Who Says a Funk Band Can't Play Rock?!  
Typed by: dy_face@hotmail.com

[Intro/Chorus: George Clinton, Walter Morrison]
Who says a jazz band, can't play dance music?
Who says a rock band, can't play funky?
Who says a funk band, can't play rock?
Oh yeah! - we're gonna play some funk so loud
We're gonna rock and roll around
Watch them dance, watch them dance

[Michael Hampton]
We're really love to play
We're really want to stay here
Won't you take the time
To get the music on your mind
We'll release you from the bind
Yeah, yeah, nah nah nah!

[Walter Morrison]
We've been around for such a while (Such a while!)
Be kinda hard not to have style (Not have style!)
When time get slower by the mile (By the mile!)
We relax and wear a great big smile
You can count my teeth
One, two, three, four, five
People think cause we are here our jazz ran out 
The ships won't steer no more
We picked up on the rhythm here
If you just take a toot and have a beer
We're gonna make it clear
Ho ho, yes, and when the morning gets here
Jazz and soul

[Chorus: George Clinton, Walter Morrison]
Who says a jazz band, can't play dance music?
Who says a rock band, can't play funky?
Who says a funk band, can't play rock?
Oh yeah! we're gonna play some funk so loud
We're gonna rock and roll around
Watch them dance, watch them dance

[Interlude: Michael Hampton]
We never take a chance
Music is our one romance
Yeah, may I have this dance
Give it a chance

(*electronic guitar played solo for 60 seconds*)

[Chorus: George Clinton, Walter Morrison X4]
Who says a jazz band, can't play dance music?
Who says a rock band, can't play funky?
Who says a funk band, can't play rock?
Oh yeah! we're gonna play some funk so loud
We're gonna rock and roll around
Watch them dance, watch them dance</pre>
