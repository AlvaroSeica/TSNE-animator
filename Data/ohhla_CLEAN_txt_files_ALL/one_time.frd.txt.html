Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling like a Houston Texan
Shawty on the phone immature, like Marcus Houston texting
Lord, I never said I was getting a Ford
I said that I was copin some shit that they can't afford
It's funny now, Fred The God they can't ignore
They use to try and sleep, but now I don't hear em snore morning
The fold just inside the coffee maker
If you in a rush, a little coffee cake I bought you here
TVM deadly, The God pin heavy
Bars is murder rough is burger, I've been ready still the beef
Aks around about Frederico
Eyes ball be ball molly, you credit chica
You see awesomeness, he copped me this beat because I hardly spit shit, I mean it's obvious
I sprinkle lyrics on the audience
And now they all intense, Fred

[Chorus]
One shot for niggas ducking one time
Two shots for niggas on the front line
Yeah moving pounds of that raw
In front the corner store, minus side a nigga more, let's go
One shot for niggas ducking one time
Two shots for niggas on the front line
Yeah, where them youngins raised different
Little niggas 16 with the K's raise hitting

[Verse 2]
I got a deathrow flow, they took nine and everything you saw
Hope sugar hill like Romelo we ain't yellow go
Go shook with hill, go mellow sugar hill
And all you niggas that got it I'm glad you know the skill
And if you don't, you got some catching up
Rappers is for you elevators is you gotta step it up
Elevator step it up, fuck it, I'll rap regular
I put my heart on these beats I'm irregular
I'm captivated, when our rap is making
Your mind activated, welcome to graduation
So listen in how hard I'm spittin
You can take a lot from this mike like you Robin Givens
I spit dough, and ya'll bars is just amountin the cliff notes
Look, they want the full blown story
Of Freddy God and ya'll got nothing for me

[Chorus]
One shot for niggas ducking one time
Two shots for niggas on the front line
Yeah moving pounds of that raw
In front the corner store, minus side a nigga more, let's go
One shot for niggas ducking one time
Two shots for niggas on the front line
Yeah, where them youngins raised different
Little niggas 16 with the K's raise hitting</pre>
