[Fly singing in a whisper]
Friend or foe, you must know, that you just can't stop the show
Hoe can't stop no show but I'm pretty sure Fly show gon' stop this hoe
Friend or foe, you must know, that you just can't stop this show
Hoe can't stop no show but I'm pretty sure Fly show gon' stop this hoe
Friend or foe, you must know, that you just can't stop this show
Hoe can't stop no show but I'm pretty sure Fly show gon' stop this hoe
Friend or foe, you must know, that you just can't stop this show

[Verse 1:]
Playa pray each and everyday, just to make it where I belong
Somewhere hangin' low chiefin' high, with the big guy I'm not alone
Playa's joanin' make suckas hot, keep on tossin' stumblin' blocks
I know evilness will not stop and still Flizy will get his props
Even though, you were speakin' so many words doggin' me
O-U-Tin' so quicka-ly I keep bustas far from the P
Fly behold and so untold of this lifestyle I struggle wit
Comin' from some of the closest ones claimin' love who you cuddle wid
Fly regrets to reminisce how passionate you claim to 'fess
Rippin' meat to take you a taste, to place me with love you give
This feelin' to Fly ain't real, you anna come close behind
Get to sneakin' to ground you hog, you need to stay far from mine,
So long sucka outta time, where's your Mr.I-B-N
All alone wid a plate a blow, wid Allah I'm in to win
Once again I must tell you so, that a hi-zo can't stop no show
Will I bet ya and pretty sure that my fli-zo gon' stop you though

Chorus:
Hoe can't stop no show but I'm pretty sure,
Fly show gon' stop this hi-zo
You a friend or foe, gotta let you know
That you just can't stop this shi-zow

Hoe can't stop no show but I'm pretty sure,
Fly show gon' stop this hi-zo
You a friend or foe, gotta let you know
That you just can't stop it, stop it

[Verse 2:]
You don't wanna fuck wit me, I'm startin' shit and endin' it
Playa Fly will pistol grip, testin' lemons quite a bit
Last nigga you fuckin' wit, and killin' anna on the real
Memphis tech or give respect, contras yellin' kill at will
Make a deal don't make a meal or fuck that bullshit that you speak
Compromise on Fly will rise, as your shit will start to leak
SPV remindin' deep that Playa plan to conquer all
Many lemons standin' tall, heaven causin' you to fall
This one goes to all ah ya'll, flodgin' freaky flaky trick
See I got ya jealous fellas from the funky rhymes I spit
Using methods super slick, deeper than they was before
On the scene and lookin' mean, wizit throw wid out some blow
Playas in and out the door forever Fly be gettin' it on
On the O we hangin' low, Mario and Tony Bone
Devious mysterious, with no patience as you prayin'
Dodgin' slugs and you will dance and you don't wanna take a chance

Hook

[Verse 3:]
Markin' me on target makes me start to sink your battleship
Playa Flizy flowin' is a force you will be reckoned with
Backed up by a power house that never lost a title bout
Fly can win a vocal fight, wid no screamin' or a shout
Why do this, Fly dismiss, dis opponents with his hiss
Maybe baby that's the way my gravy gets encouragement
Intelligence my nourishment, represent the SPV
Only Flizy can leave the show, the show can't be leavin' me
Prolongin' situations you nervous to flow you patient
For me you plan aggravation you witness cause complications
Places that I used to go, guess what I will go some more
If I catch a trace ah your face I replace you for friend or foe
Only trust protect myself with the guy I fear as my help
Only one who gives me tony, and weak cause of faith I kept
Still you step and try to face, thinkin' here should plant his cross
I know that's one reason why, this Playa show stayin' on
