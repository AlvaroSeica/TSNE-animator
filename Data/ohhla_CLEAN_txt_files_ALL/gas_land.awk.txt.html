[Verse 1: AWKWORD]
Politicians be like, we gon frack our way to freedom
Corporations dash for cash on our backs while we sleeping
[Continuing tradition], trash the earth as it weakens
While we work the double shift at check out lines, on weekends
In the name of [Edwin Drake], in '47 [frack]'s invented
All Obama did was make, fed lands, protected
Minority rules, in every state that's, invested
[Financial sites show fracking stocks to be the best investment]
They did the math, so of course, the teams decided
The 99 percent of us, must not be divided
Stay woke, yeah, we cannot be blindsided
Led by rhyme writers, our fight, fire ignited
They don't care about our health, or even that of their fam
They don't even fear the courts, there's no justice, fat chance
[He made a movie], now, we compose a rap jam
Follow the fault lines beneath us, welcome to Gas Land

[Hook: AWKWORD (2X)]
We gon frack for freedom, we gon frack for freedom
And this award goes to the best frack of the evening
In Gas Land they Hollywood, think they act as we would
But where we live we like, hands off, frack ya own hood

[Verse 2: AWKWORD]
[In Gas Land, it's terrible], like you gon get kilt, by chemicals
Or better yet, break in two, when some earthquake levels you
Please, don't hope for an open casket when they bury you
While their lobbyists stay working, so no one, remembers you
And don't believe, their new jobs, will bring, any kind a bread for you
Think that measly paycheck's gonna be what betters you?
If that job is something, that you said you'd never do
Exchanging tax breaks and lap dances, drill for revenue
Fracking, by definition, causes fractures
And sure, yeah, that's nothing, it's what we know that happens after
Acid rain, radiation, ecological disaster
Now my water got formaldehyde and hydrochloric acid
And they only capture 30 to 50 percent of fracturing fluid
Leaving the rest of the toxins underground, sitting there polluting
Causing respiratory and neurological, damage to humans
So self-abusive. [Vote, riot, make change, solutions]

[Hook: AWKWORD (2X)]
We gon frack for freedom, we gon frack for freedom
And this award goes to the best frack of the evening
In Gas Land they Hollywood, think they act as we would
But where we live we like, hands off, frack ya own hood

[Verse 3: Chaundon]
These energy companies are illin all this horizontal drillin
Literally making a mothafuckin killin
Got our sons and daughters consuming contaminated water
While the shareholders line their pockets up every quarter
Mild earthquakes are the results
But studies say it ain't definitive and they believe that shit like a cult
All the toxins pollutin the air
But since it's all about their bottom line they convince us not to be scared
But two years ago the EPA had failed to report
Radium in Pennsylvania's rivers where's the support
Who's out protecting us I guess we're all short
Ain't like the law is on our side so what's the point to try to take 'em to court
Exxon and Chevron are major players
Whose deep pockets are the motivators to sway the minds of legislators
And they all think that money makes the world go round
But what it takes to get the money brings the whole world down

[Hook: AWKWORD (2X)]
We gon frack for freedom, we gon frack for freedom
And this award goes to the best frack of the evening
In Gas Land they Hollywood, think they act as we would
But where we live we like, hands off, frack ya own hood

[Outro: Protest crowd, chanting]

Ban fracking now!
