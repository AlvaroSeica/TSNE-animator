[Chris Tucker + Ice Cube from "Friday"]
Take a puff... take a hit!! {*heh*}
Cra.. CRAIG~!!
Ain't like got shit to do tomorrow
You don't have to go to work; go on take a hit!
{Nigga I drink} Craig, that stimulate your mind!
You ain't got shit to do {aight}
Put it in your mouth {shut up!!}

[Intro: The Game]
That Mary Jane, that O.G. kush
That sour diesel drive them girls insane
I roll it up she disappear, like David Blaine
And she ain't tryin to book a flight, on that paper plane
She don't wanna hit the J {*4X*}

[The Game]
Throw on that undefeated tank, then throw on my chain
Throw on that new kid red, bitch it's Money Gang
See that red Maserati, niggaz know it's Game
Drive that bitch down Rosecrans and blow the brains
Got that Rolly on my wrist, man that hoe insane
Remind me of my chick Regatta, she out in Spain
Got a squad full of chicks, I ain't droppin names
They all bald like that girl that play for Notre Dame; what's her name?
Skylar Diggins yeah that's right that's right, you know I'll be diggin
I'll be eatin out that kitten, I'll be piggin out
Never take her out, to crustaceans that be in and out
Just like that chocolate shake, nigga goin in her mouth
She do everything 'cept smoke; that mean let a niga poke
That mean she be off the coke like Paris and her folks
Swear to God she a poke man - but she like Lindsay Lohan
Except she be runnin from that dope man

[Chorus: The Game]
That Harry Potter, that Mary Jane
That O.G. kush that sour diesel drive them girls insane
I roll it up she disappear, like David Blaine
And she ain't tryin to book a flight, on that paper plane
Cause she don't wanna hit the J (she don't wanna hit the J) {*2X*}
Cause she don't wanna hit the J (she don't wanna hit it)
Nah she don't wanna hit the J (oooh, whoahhh, yeah)

[Lifestyle]
All these bitches in my face, I'm blowin up
Man when I'm steppin in the place, we be po'n up
Fourteen bottles of Ace, models showin up
I tell her homey break that down and we gon' roll it up
Yeah, it's +Friday+ and she ain't got shit to do
And we ain't got shit to do, so umm - what's good with you?
Smoke a little, talk a little, roll that up girl twist that J
Remind me of my nigga Ronald, she ain't tryin to hit that J
Different J's, different locs, different days, +Different Strokes+
I smoke that shit that made +Arnold+ and +Willis+ broke
You know my lifestyle, Swishers in them light styles
Bitches in the White House, red Camaro piped out
I'll be iced out, my blunts be packed in
I'll smoke them 'til there's no more, I'm like the Pac-10
I'm 'bout to pack ten bitches with them accents
Then we 'bout to pack twelve Swishers in that black Benz

[Chorus]

[Outro]
{"TAKE A HIT!"}
Two puffs, two verses
That's all you get... nig-gah~!!
And stop mean muggin muh-fucker!</pre>
