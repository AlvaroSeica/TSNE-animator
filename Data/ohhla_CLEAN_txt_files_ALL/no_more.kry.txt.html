[Kryme Life]
Everyday you got babies being born and babies being killed
And the mothers left to mourn while the father's not avail'
The stronger foundation plus the hustle of a meal
Ain't nothing coming easy, get your muscle, I'm for real
A nigga going hard, posting on his corners with felonies
Looking for a job, companies don't want us
We at war with society, the law run up on us
To feed our sons and our daughters, that's our only priority
They calling us minority, but we the majority
Adjusting the statistics, they don't count poverty
Now, let's be realistic, everybody seeing it
They show they true feelings when Hurricane Katrina hit
The government wasn't gon' send us any help
They left us to die in hell, they wonder why we rebel
Every man, woman and child, that survive with stories to tell
S.O.S., has a new meaning, we Saving Our Selves

[Chorus: Kryme Life]
No more tears to cry, the rivers run dry
Walk without fear, we ain't scared to die
It's been a long struggle, I'm still alive to rise
Stand strong, keep moving on, I'mma strive
Seen the fire in my eyes burning
Every day lived is another day learning
They can't stop lying, like they can't stop the world from turning
Aiyo, my niggas work hard, we earned it

[Kryme Life]
Somebody tell me what we living for, and we living pour
I can't believe I'm still living after what I saw
Yeah, it's been a rough life, I bet my momma's
Only wish was that eldest son came up right
Instead of, ducking from bullets, dodging police lights
Hoping that she don't get that call on them lonely nights
And we trying to make pay, breaking day, all up in the projects
Nautious, so I don't get caught up in the process
I got the code of the V, and I got to meet, all the honeys
That's why daddy got a steady freak
Believe it ain't easy, I feel like I've been put here
To struggle, it's funny how society see's me
Low class, low income, toting guns
No lie, people said I would die, before 21
Still here, more money, more problems are sure to come
I stand here, facing my fears, I never run
