[Intro: RZA]
Yeah, word, we up in the joint and shit
You know how it is, nigga been smoked the
Some of that Hulk shit, got my girl Tekitha up in this joint
She bout to blow some phat shit for ya'll niggas
Youknowhatimean, got my niggas on the guitar
Yo, yeah, this shit is right, right?
Go ahead talk to them, girl

[Chorus: Tekitha]
Serenade the song of mystery, ghetto children beautiful
Life and play, making history, music change, and they follow
Have it on with what I say, what the hell, must lead the way
So you can borrow me the crown, not in Dolby, in surround sound
Serenade the song of mystery, ghetto children beautiful
Life and play, making history, music change, and they follow
Have it on with what I say, what the hell, must lead the way
So you can borrow me the crown, not in Dolby, in surround sound

[Tekitha]
Jump roping, shit cracking, outback with the gal
Building, project halls, standing tall like
Skyscrapers, we are, ghetto ghetto ghetto children, children, children
Avenues and blocks and, parks and, barbeques
Community swimming pools, a home with no rules
Serenade... keep on serenading, ghetto children
Sereande...</pre>
