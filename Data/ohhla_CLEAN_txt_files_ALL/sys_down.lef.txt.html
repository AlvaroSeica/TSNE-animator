[Jake Lefco]
Yo, yo
Yo welcome to the era of the war on terror
Arrogant American era, look in the mirror
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Welcome to the era of the war on terror
Arrogant America era, look in the mirror
Look ahh... yo
Yo welcome to the era of the war on terror
Arrogant America era, look in the mirror
Bush and them pushin them nearer, those cowboy tactics are backwards
Especially when the enemy's abstract
Fuck it, they could be in your backpack
I never heard a terrorist afraid to attack back
The sad fact is that it's that bad, we're losin that fast
Sacrificin lives and troops in Baghdad
Explanation is half-assed and faded
Then when the real issue is raised, they hit you with cliches
Tell you to be brave, in the eye of the storm
Stayin the course, young soldiers payin the cost
Breakin my heart, makin it hard to thank God
It's wrong, at home and abroad, losin support
Political power is nothin to die for
It's impossible to liberate a nation by force

[vocal samples]
What's happening - your mind, your spirit, your soul?
  I haven't seen you sparkle in years
Because you believed in it
What do you believe in now?
"The main element here that we have to deal with
 is the fact that fear is what's driving a lot of people"

[Jake Lefco]
What kind of system sends innocent men across enemy lines
and spends billions on bombs~?
Wipes out cities, sayin civilians don't die
Same system saw a hurricane... whew
What kind of system sends innocent men across enemy lines
and spends billions on bombs~?
Wipes out cities, sayin civilians don't die
Same system saw a hurricane and didn't respond
Just a last minute notice to evacuees, pack your things
The poorest are the last to leave
Traffic jams of minivans and SUV's
And if you don't have a car, you're called a refugee
Gettin F-U-C, K-E-D by powers that be
Huggin your roof, or floatin down an empty street
Painful truth, as clear as ema{?}
Shed shame on a nation like Hiroshima, where the fuck was FEMA?
Can't believe what the media feeds us
Fear plus the blind trust in G.I. Jesus
And I can see why we just freeze up
Please, government's not gonna speak up, but we must

[vocal samples]
It's not an issue of politics, Democrat and Republican
It's an issue of experience, and being a soldier, and watching people DIE
Umm, for reasons that are at best, uhh suspect
You can't point your weapon at a person, you point it at everything</pre>
