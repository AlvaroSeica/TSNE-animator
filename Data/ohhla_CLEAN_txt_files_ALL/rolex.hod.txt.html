[Hodgy Beats]
Murder murder, someone you never heard of
but you need to be scared of, pullin your bitches skirt up
Swimmin with womens surf's up, blue Jordan Air 1's Smurfed up
My breath stinks like I burped up, I'm dirty like a dirt truck
Freeway music sorry but I must emerge up
I always come first, never placed with the third cup
Don't act like you deaf nigga, I know you heard us
Thats why you shakin in your pants; bitch, you nervous
I rise 'til I can't get no higher; moth to the flame and I am the fire
Nick Cannon on my hip right next to Mariah, Messiah desire before I expire
We tie you in your home with the phone lines wired; work 'til tired, midnight rider
3 a.m. pull up right beside ya (3 a.m. pull up right beside ya)
I live with bats like I'm a fuckin Dodger
Neighborhood life right by Mr. Rodger
You niggaz get more even and I get more +Odder+
(You niggaz get more even and I gets more +Odder+)

[Chorus]
I run off winter time like a {platinum Rolex}
I run on winter time like a {platinum Rolex}
I run off winter time like a {platinum Rolex}
I run on winter time like a {platinum Rolex}
Like a {platinum Rolex} like a {platinum Rolex}
I run off winter time like a {platinum Rolex}
I run on winter time like a {platinum Rolex}
I run off winter time like a {platinum Rolex}

Eat my dust taste my auto fumes (yup)
Original swagger, no AutoTune (uh-uh)
Niggaz hit the radio, and they gettin respect
I'm still dialin Power 106, callin collect (ha ha ha~!)
Express through music I explore myself (yeah)
Self-made money, I employ myself
Contemplatin suicide - should I destroy myself? (Uh-oh)
Or restore my health cause I support like belts
Pull up your trousers, this world is Mario, find a realm
and you up against Bowser
I'm sorry to the girls fantasizin about me in your browser
My girl 'bout it 'bout it, don't let her get riled up
I count up every dollar that I get from the ground up
Cowboy with the rope, and I gallop when I round up
Eight to ten, I chase to win
Finish where I left off, where do I begin?
