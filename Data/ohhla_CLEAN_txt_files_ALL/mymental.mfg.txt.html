[Chorus]
My mentality is money orientated
Ballin' in your money long, you can relate (you can relate)
My mentality is money orientated
Ballin' in your money long, you can relate (you can relate)
My mentality is money orientated
Ballin' in your money long, you can relate (you can relate)
My mentality is money orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it

[Verse 1]
So many brother are gone, I'm still here for a reason
On the paper chase, trackin' like a bounty hunter
Got war stories, all true, real tragic
Life is still pretty enough to win a beauty pageant
Success is hard to catch, most are glad to touch it
I'm trying to grab it man, lock on it when I clutch it
It's not like I love it, surviving it is needed
I got a family and without this paper I can't feed it
Plus I'm far from greedy, MF spread love
Act like Ebenezer, sometimes that's what bread does
Lying and cheating and feening like a head does
Too many died, money can't make it the way it was
Moving narcotics, nah that's ancient
Though the money's clean I still got a dirty conscience
Die trying, my death I'm not viewing it
I'ma get rich and live good doing it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Keep my eye on my money, try to mace me, left me blind
I see in the dark, a way out is what I'll find
As I lead the way, non-believers left behind
There's a price to pay if you worship riches
Cause Hell is blazin', soul dried like a raisin
How evil this world can be is so amazing
Influential be demons of temptation but no longer they fazin
Don't want finer things, I would be a liar
The only difference now is how it all gets acquired
No cocaine, no selling heroin
I'm making legal ends all with a pad and pen
I was told don't work harder nigga work smarter
Get that paper like you're Sean John or Shawn Carter
I have no choice but to become a millionaire
so many of my brothers died just to get me here

[Chorus]</pre>
