[ VERSE 1: Eightball ]
Most niggas don't dig 'em when they act too tough
But my boo roll 'em fat and sip syrup with us
We be like dust, I'm the dopest, she the cut
Always together, hangin like a pair of nuts
Trust, I never met someone that act like you
When you start trippin, girl, you make me wanna fight you
And you don't back down, always tryina show yo ass
I guess that's why I got so much love for yo ass
Whether it be on the corner or in the bed
No matter who's around, you be down with your man
Learnin what I love and lovin what I learn about you
No matter what I say I know I couldn't do without you
Mama say you got me wrapped around your pinky finger
But she don't know what you be doin to my pinky finger
Also my mind and my spirit feel good vibes
When I look into yo eyes
My ghetto love

Ghetto love, ghetto love
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto love
Ghetto love, ghetto love
(Don't hurt me again)

[ VERSE 2: Slim Goodie ]
We been down for years, I done shed tears for yo mistakes
Love to give and to take, but you ain't never played the fake
Role, took me on a stroll through the ghettos of life
Introduced me as yo ghetto wife
I remember when we first caught eye connection cross the room
Remember when we used to consume 
Lots of weed smoke, have a deep speech, I suppose
Catch a vibe and dispose all the glow
Them gold teeth got ( ? ) freaks bustin they knees
Tryina get to Slim G's properties
But I ain't worried 'bout a thing, cause through the thick and thin
You been my nigga, been my lover, boy, you been my friend
And I can't forget the way you made real love feel
Down to die for me, nigga down to kill for your ghetto thrill
And we cool like that
No matter what, I know you got my back
Like that

Ghetto love, ghetto love
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto love
Ghetto love, ghetto love
(Don't hurt me again)

[ SG ]
Our feelings are deep, concrete love got me sprung
Been sweet on you ever since a little young'n in the ghetto
Smilin with them gold teeth in your mouth
Make a bitch crazy 'bout a nigga down south
Young thug indeed with your lovin me
[ 8B ]
I'ma dig deeply and make sho' you feel me
Scratchin up my back and screamin out my name
[ SG ]
And I'm glad you respect the game
Baby we can maintain together, just hang together
Birds of a feather, smoke Mary Jane together
[ 8B ]
You and I, me and you, situation been sticky
Since way back when I used to give you hickeys
Childhood sparks grew into a flame
All through the game you remained and you didn't change
Luckily handcuffs never buckle me
We keep a cookie jar just for such emergencies
She don't trip, riff ain't what we based on
She know I'm hustlin when a nigga don't come home
She my bitch (He my nigga) dig that, baby
Ain't no other like my ghetto lover

Ghetto love, ghetto love
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto love
Ghetto love, ghetto love
(Don't hurt me again)</pre>
