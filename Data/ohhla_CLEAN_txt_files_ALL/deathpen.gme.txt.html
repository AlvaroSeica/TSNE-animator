Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro: Fabolous]
For not being who you claim, you've been found guilty
Two Counts of being lame, you've been found guilty
The Charge of fuckin up the game, you've been found guilty
Real niggaz sentence you - death penalty!

[Fabolous]
Ugh, let's get back to this real shit...
We Rrde no pump brakes...
Everybody actin like they the shooters...
Man, I ain't goin for them pump fakes
These niggaz is crumb cakes, wish they would say somethin snake
Get banged on like a trouble makes the dumb mistake of tryin to jump with Blake
These niggaz in my lane, Lob City in these streets
Jesus piece on my chain, need God with me in these streets
I went through hell just to get where heaven is
Lucy in that red dress lookin devilish
Scale to 1 to 10, she lookin elevenish
If she ain't ridin shotty AK-47 this (haha~!)
Shorty came to me when she left her man (man)
I looked at her and said you somethin else (somethin else)
But the best way to get over somebody (over somebody)
is gettin under someone else
On that note I'm in that (whoa) 1-2-3 pin that (whoa}
They be tellin me I'm the best; I be yellin "I been that!" (Nice)
In the club, half a pill and a full clip
Get a deal on a +Rose+, no +Bulls+shit

[Game]
Derrick Rose ghost, I'm in that muh'fucka like Pac-Man
Niggaz talking bout +Robin+, I ain't goin for that +Batman+
King of Diamonds like super Sunday, hundred thou' for that lap dance
See straight through you pussy niggaz, I call that a cat scan
On that note, we in here, peach Ciroc, pronto
My gun throw bullets like Peyton Manning my chick walk around with that Bronco
Extended clip in that console, two mill' for that condo
We gon shoot for that green (whoa) I ain't talkin no Rondo
... Nigga try to say that I ain't a G
I pointed at him said "You somethin else"
See these +Basketball Wives+ all around my table?
We bout to swim through 'em like Mike Phelps
Now pop open that 10-pack, your life savings I spent that
Niggaz spammin my Instagram, beggin me for they bitch back
Sendin threats to my DM, tryin to hack my e-mail
Niggaz whisperin to theyself all huddled up like females
Yo bitch 'bout to get detailed (whoa) I ain't sparin no details (WOAH)
She choked up like Sprewell, I drop her off in that V-12 (nice)
Ridin round with that Houston Rocket
Keep all of that Jeremy Lin shit in pocket

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
For not being who you claim, you get found guilty
TWo accounts up in yo name, you get found guilty
Charged with fuckin up the game, you get found guilty
Real niggaz sentence you, death penalty (HEY)
Death Penalty (HEY) {*4X*}
Charged with fuckin up the game, you get found guilty
Real niggaz sentence you, death penalty

[Slim Thug]
I'm goin back to Cali, I'm goin back to Cali
I'm outta drank and 'dro so I'm goin back to Cali
I need pints by the cases for this bag of big faces
Couple pounds of that kush I ain't the only one gettin wasted
Smoke a lil', sell the rest, I'ma hustla baby gotta invest
Gettin mine plus interest, you niggaz still ain't winnin yet?
I just sold my fourth Bentley, then I got that fo' door Porsche
Bout to switch it up for the summer, thinkin 'bout that electric Hummer
Strapped up got extra armor, in case a hatin nigga wanna play
Everything I rap a hundred, you can check my resume
They dont make 'em like me no mo'
They dont make 'em this G no mo'
I dont see too many G's
I just see a bunch of CB4's (geah)
Let's get back to that real shit
That Pac, B.I.G., U.G.K. kinda +Trill+ shit
East, West, and the South
If you see a fake nigga point him out! {*echoes*}

[Chorus]</pre>
