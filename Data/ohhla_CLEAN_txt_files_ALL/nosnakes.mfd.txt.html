"Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"

[King Ghidra/King Geedorah]
..Ghidra has arrived
You guys could take five
By the time it's over...
No snakes alive!
Take the dive, I'm tellin you, you better off
Then up against a flow to make her, take her sweater off
From the set off when it came to scripts he could hardly brag
It's the result of concentration, and lolly-gag
I said "Yeah right" he pulled the mic out a snotty rag
Sealed up air-tight, and wrapped up in a body bag
Get a advance and catch chance writer's block
After spendin the first and last penny
My own worst enemy
Tell me if I'm OD and usual flow
And made deals with these cats who keep sending dough, so
The Three Headed said it, never get busted
He's a man of his word who's not to be trusted
Beats encrypted, multi-faceted encrusted
Shorty pawn, keep mic rusted
(*The beat and rapping get's faster*)Sort of mellow type of fellow
Who sometimes spaz on wife like Othello
Hell no he won't use words like illuminati
Or Gotti all shotty might use karate
Azar the Gaza cut I'll ask why a mask
With the gall style caps say nice fly
(*Flow goes back to original*)Exact dough til it stack high, white ho, black
guy
The rap game, black eye

[Jet Jaguar]
Exhiliration, Jet Jag's accelerations
Touch speeds minds can't concieve
Achieve altered, attitudes and angles, angels answer
Aura, illumilation, awesome interperation
Awkward alarm, ankle house arrest and who's best?
Monster Island Czars
Crush pawn dreams to be king
A frank reality
Calculation could never be
Quest destined, distant competition dusted
Disgusted raise for second, crowded
clouded confusion, conclusion: simple, plain
Self education, self made millionaires
Serpents slitherin, sidewind searchin
Stalkin, heat sensin
(*Beat goes faster*)Can't have me Jet Jag's riki tiki tavi
Superhero hit zero to sixty
Hot pursuit, pedal to the floor
Handlin lyrics, traction swervin
Left right makin head fix, layin high stakes
Levitates, quick hit breaks
They fly past hit war parts fly loose, kill a mongoose

[Rodan]
Fake niggaz contiue to practice the art of intimidation
Sterile minds concieve and threw up all artificial insemination
Syntax a sequential rage unless it's all deliberate
Angle wide words clear, but population stay illiterate
Consider it God's a fine power, fools get rid of it
Men build dreams on promises but lacken the will to deliver it
You, I disolve connivers like saliva on tic tacs
World is strange, but get the job done like sises mix max
Flip tracks, murder stinks, drunk niggaz killin six packs
Chokin on venom, suffered tricknological kick backs
Poverty stricken minds, all thoughts barely worth two cents
Build history through time, many a design on blueprints
Anooshes slides in the sky, eight-five percent never knew
Wise men arise, pull files like internal revenue
Forever true, appauled? There's self evidence with leverage
(*The beat and rapping get's faster*)Upset? The beast belly concoct
homogenised beverage
Clever shit, calculate a sabatoge trojan horse
Gift from ? see through any G motion that grows in force
Chose to toss to teach familiar line throughout the underworld
God of elevation kills Superman, rape Wondergirl
The discounted, decapitated rapist it's acceptable
The everyday occurance a fatal outcome's inevitable

[King Ghidra/King Geedorah]
..Might as well join the forces boss
Chance take a loss like coin toss
Roll with the double headed nickel
Pawn the pawn a Jet Jag with the sickle you and a pickle
King Ghidra yo you ass betta leave 'em alone
Before ya go catch a seizure and leave 'em blown
If you ain't the best of the best in the top three
Either myself, I and me
Don't even think of caps
But act like you had a slight inkling perhaps
Or get smacked back in the ring like Bob Backlund
Ink jet black and wack...

"Hahahahahaha!
Hey, what's the meaning of this?"
"Shut up!"
"Hahahahahahahaha, young man.."</pre>
