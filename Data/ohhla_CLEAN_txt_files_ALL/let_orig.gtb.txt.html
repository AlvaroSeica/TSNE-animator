* Willie D adds a second verse to the previous version

[Intro]
[Ready Red] Yo D man, what's up with that cash register shit? 
[Willie D] Oh that's what the average ho see everytime she look at a modern day man 
[Ready Red] Ain't that the motherfucking truth!! 
[Willie D] Yeah ~ and these old fickle-minded ass niggaz wonder 
why a ho be with them one day and another goofy motherfucker the next
[Ready Red] I think it's time you kicked some more of that shit! 
[Willie D] Yeahhhhhhhhhh! 

[Verse One: Willie D]
It seems to be a lot of motherfuckers blind to the fact
That a whore is going to be just that
And this type of ignorance is the very
Reason why so many niggaz in the God damn cemetery
Intelligence is on call
You don't treat a whore like a queen, who behaves like a dog
Are you the type who won't put a whore in front of a trigger?
Then youse a whore-ass nigga
God damn hound, pound for pound
You knew the whore when she was fucking the whole town
She fucked you and gave your buddies a blow
But your trick ass fell in love with the whore
Tried to change her, make her be an angel
You keep putting your damn life in danger
Fronting niggaz about that slutty-ass trifling crow
You gotta let a hoe be a hoe!

[Verse Two: Willie D]
Here's something that I'd like to know (what?) 
Why you take that whore, everywhere you go? 
You walk around the club with the whore in front 
Trying to keep up with that nasty-ass cunt 
You say you're captain, but your ship keeps sinking 
As soon as you turn your back, the whore is blinking 
Winking her eye at another nigga 
But you got her locked down, so you figure 
Whore wears your jewelry every God damn day
But nigga, you just got the whore on display 
Wouldn't let her be herself, cause you was a God damn wimp 
Now you know why.. whores date pimps 
She's a Rhinestone freak five days a week
But you get mad when niggaz pop on her ass 
Goddamn slutty whore, the bars are loaded 
Don't try to change her, you let the hoe be a hoe! 

[Verse Three: Willie D]
She's a whore (D, how the fuck you know?)
Everytime I see the whore, she's with a new negro
She's the kind of whore that's bound;
to wear shorts up her ass when your friends come around
The kind of whore that'll make you cry
The kind of whore you have to call, before you come by
So why you wanna care when she says no more?
You ain't the first to be dumped by a God damn whore!
Crazy motherfuckers fighting over whores
Stealing for their asses and jumping out of windows
If a whore want out, I let her stanky ass go
Cause I'ma let a hoe be a hoe!

[Break]
[Willie D] Now do y'all follow me so motherfucking far?
[Bushwick] Yeaaaah! 
[Scarface] Hell yeah, I remember I let this ho named Kim use my car 
[Scarface] Bitch went to go see another nigga; I damn near killed that ho
[Willie D] Ha ha I fucked that whore man! 
[Scarface] You a motherfucking lier! 
[Willie D] I ain't bullshitting! 
[Scarface] You a motherfucking lier! 
[Willie D] Hah.. didn't I, Bushwick and Red? 
[Ready Red] He went up in that bitch, man! 
[Bushwick] On the for rilla, my nigga 

[Verse Four: Willie D]
Akshen man I'm telling you man
I fucked that whore, before you even knew her
Made her pussy go WHOOOOO when I stuck my dick to her
I knew she was a whore the first time I met her
So I got another whore and took her to the other level
of the game, got her high as a kite
And fucked BOTH of those whores that God damn night!
Then I sat back and relaxed
As they sixty-nined, and ate each other's cat
I dropped them off at home
God damn, look at this shit, my wallet's gone!
The whores beat me but I left it alone
and used that shit as a stepping stone
I played it off the next time I saw the whore
I just laughed and fucked her ass some more
She licked my ass, and sucked my balls
And if I see her right now, I can get them drawers

[Chorus: Scarface]
You gotta let a hoe be a hoe
You gotta let a hoe be a hoe

[Willie D] 
Yeah buddy! Willie D ain't gonna let these whores get him down
I ain't crying or dying over none of you whores
I ain't buying you no leather, I ain't buying you no suedes
No jewelry, no contacts, no Lee nails
Ain't buy you no hair, no makeup, fool! 
None of that good shit 

[Bushwick] Tell them D

[Outro: Scarface]
You gotta let a hoe be a hoe
You gotta let a hoe be a hoe
You gotta let a hoe be a hoe
You gotta let a hoe be a hoe
You gotta let a hoe be a hoe</pre>
