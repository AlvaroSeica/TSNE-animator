Song:   What Is the Essence of a Soul Kid?
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: all]
What is the essence of a Soul Kid?
What is the essence of a Soul Kid?
What is the essence of a Soul Kid?
What is the essence of a Soul Kid?

[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
It's the G-Clef, the man with the finger on the button
pimp strutting on this dust, so now it's time to bust
Not for self, but for my crew
Ghetto Philharmonic's in the house, so what you gonna do?
Go run and hide, that's suicide, so dig it
A caucazoid Soul Kid is taking out biggets
So frig it, fuck that, bust back the track
All you Aunt Jemima pancake rappers are just stacked
Joe Pesci of the mic, I'm kicking M.C.'s in the ass
When he pass the gas, I take 'em out quick fast
Because you know I got that attitude, that temperment
That's why I'm kinda rude when I represent
Cuz I know how to make a beat sound complete
I'm so funky, I stink from my pits to my feet
A Soul Kid I can be without the use of a gat
The essence of the Clef is I'm phat

[Chorus]

[Blakspik]
So give me the mic, so give me the mic and watch me get raw now
The Blakspik will huff and puff and blow the door down
The essence of the soul is a mental state of mind
Your tongue has to snap with a track a to form a rhyme
Just say you want some flavor, I got hits like Tito Puente
dont step so I'm grand and slam like EL grand combo
Suckas step up and catch a swift one to the eye
Before I sell out, I be a Soul Kid til I die
Cuz I can grab the mic, flip the script and get serious
Cuz I can funky like a skunk on his period
Yeah, here comes the ill mass murderer
Look out, I'm tossing up herbs to the curb
Step to your crew, before I diss ya
Bust shots with my glock, but my name ain't Amy Fisher
The Blakspik is definitely definitely definitely on a roll
Now you know (What?) What is the essence of the Soul

[Infamous Mr. Savage]
Aahoooh, it's a full moon night of the Soul Kid
Shiners of the Soul, we got the best funk in show biz
So let me go buckwild on the set for the rough necks
And flex the dialect to gain mad respect
Now who am I, I be the mass murdering marauder
Whose raps are kicking ass like my name was Sgt. Slaughter
The ragga muffin yes I know I'm tough and I'm not bluffing
The strong arm of my crew, the one that's does the snuffin
And my name, the Infamous, kicking this shit off the lip
Tip I flip quick, with jaws like a vicegrip
It is the Savage that is shamming you, damning you
A cannibal like a Hannibal, living as an animal
Ooh-ahh! Listen to me roar like a tiger
Ooh-ahh! Plus, I'm crazy clever like MacGyver
As I liven up my pack I never slack, on a track
And either you can get with this, or I'mma break ya back

[Chorus]

[Quayshaun]
I'm surrounded, soul kids to the left and to the right of me
Finding me and inviting me down so they confide in me
I ride the rhythm, it's the essence of the essence
Of the inner essence, to the manifesting of my lessons
It's the ill non-nappy headed legend like a folk tale
Understand the cadence of my thoughts broke the scale
It's the ill like diseasin, kicking with the unexplainable
Element, breaking down your plan as brains are swelling
Cuz you couldn't understand the ill, you tried to diss it
But my soul come blastin from within so you missed it
I freak a track like a hooker in a spandex
So what's next to blast ya atmosphere and wreck ya headset?
Oooh, I be the illest illegitimate statistic
The funk most sadistic, with more juice than Mystic
Come feel the rhythm, rumble rumble through your rectum
The Soul Kids have now wrecked ya spectrum

[Chorus]</pre>
