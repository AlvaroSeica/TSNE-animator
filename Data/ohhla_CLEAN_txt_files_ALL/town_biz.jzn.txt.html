[Chief Chinchilla]
Yeah~! Chief Chinchilla on his way to the motherfuckin Bay Area
to get some Roscoe's Chicken &amp; Waffles
I wonder what the fuck they be drinkin out here though?
Gotta ask my man Ammbush from the town whassup
Let 'em know what they be drinkin out here

"Straight out the motherfuckin Bay!"

[Ammbush]
I drink the Town Bizness, not Schlitz Malt Liquor
It's the mix to get you higher than Hitler
Forget the dead homey, nah for him it won't spill
You want a swig my nig then don't get killed!
(Ooooooh, oooooh) Not Mistadobalina
Just a copy drinker, split it with my people
Get it in the fo'-oh or the two liter
Just mobbin in the fo'-do' or the two seater

[Chief Chinchilla]
I stepped off the bar train, Fruitville Station
Got a poor start to my day by not drinkin
I stepped into the sto', got the Town Bizness
Sideshow unicycle on twentysixes
Called up my bitches, head to the Coliseum
Pimp drunk and my Warriors I gotta see 'em
Montay gettin busy makin niggaz look mad
Then I earl in the bar train after the game
{*bleh*} Enbankment I went the wrong way
Ohh shit!

("Town Bizness! Find it at your local swap meet or flea market.
 Conveniently located next to your favorite gun store, church or chicken shack.")</pre>
