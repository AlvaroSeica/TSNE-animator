[Chorus: Saul Williams] (Repeat 4x)
Bitch nigga, gun trigger
Dick's bigger, why fuck?
Killer, blood spiller
Bitch, steal a Mac truck
Bad luck, fuckin' with this black buck
Bigger Thomas, I promise
Leave a corpse in the furnace

[Saul Williams]
Nigga what?
I'm complicated down to my strut
Like the way I hold my gat flat on it's side like a pug
And I'm tickling the trigger make it laugh from it's gut
You would think I'm a comedian the way it erupts
Nigga what?
I represent the ashes and dust
All that's sittin' up in ya chin that's got ya stuck in a rut
You can fire, hold your fire, son, I'm smoking' you up
You can whistle your desires, even Buddah got snuffed
Nigga now
I'm standing on the corner of Wow
Exclamations pointed at me cause I'm gettin' these nouns
Got these kids inventing adjectives and gaining renown
Cuz I am nigga, I am
Nigga please
The earth, the air, the fire and the seas
Third dimension, fourth dimension, fifth dimension with ease
Oh, the chicken never thought I've got ya smokin' them trees
Ask your front door what my sawed off got you snortin' them keys
Nigga what?
But I ain't gonna knock open up
When it's time to meet your maker ain't no changing the plot
You're an actor in the series, nigga, I own the lot
And I'm here to serve these royalties like gold in a pot
Callin' haves and have-nots (Repeat 8x)
Hey, ain't no need to stop that (Repeat 3x)
Hey, ain't no need
God and pussy
Objects of desire
And ill repute
Some rather seek up high
Than dig and grind that inner truth
The angel of my eye a bit too fly to substitute
With any other form than the Messiah's
Black Mariah, mothership, grandmother moon and sea
The wave and form of beauty born of Eden's apple tree
And every single Adam stands erect and prays to be
The follower she offers sweet communion
Holy union, let me see you run it just like that
Move your hips from side to side
Come forward, push it back
Let me know firsthand the land of glory, that I lack
I surrender all to you if you surrender back
Holy God, where'd you learn to squeeze it tight and then
Move it slow enough for me to question everything?
You slowly start to tremble
Heaven's walls begin to sing
Tsunami ever after
Cosmic slop on everything
Hey, ain't no need to stop that
Hey, ain't no need to stop that

[Chorus: Saul Williams] (Repeat 2x)
Bitch nigga, gun trigger
Dick's bigger, why fuck?
Killer, blood spiller
Bitch, steal a Mac truck
Bad luck, fuckin' with this black buck
Bigger Thomas, I promise
Leave a corpse in the furnace</pre>
