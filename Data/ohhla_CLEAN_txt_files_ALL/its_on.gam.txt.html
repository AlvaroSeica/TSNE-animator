[Childish Gambino]
Uhhh~! Okay what's up my nigga? Word up to seven figures
My swag is always capital, it live in North Virginia
'Bino on that hood beat, ye ain't know he had it in him
Came on this beat, I ain't even buy it dinner - uhh!
Slide inside the party late, leaving with the baddest hoe
Whiskey shots and doin Asian bitches is the status quo
The future's always comin whether clitoral or vaginal
Always in that pussy like my jacket made of calico
It's on, I made this shit for New Year's
Play this shit at midnight, like TV shows with boobies
My asthma status chronic, you can get an ounce of that
Real G's only - don't fuck up my alphabet
I'm as real as I'ma get, loser who got confident
Attracted to an awkward bitch but mostly cause we're opposites
Blew up in 0-10 like tick tick boom
No drugs at the club, I'ma slip shit through
Came hard on this bitch and my dick did too
Here's a list of the shit I'm addicted to like
Weed, whiskey, sometimes ex
But that is only when I'm drunk and call her up to have sex
These girls I'm fuckin now see my dick as blank checks
So I only sign my name and dot my 'I's but only on her chest, yes

[Chorus]
What y'all really want? What y'all really want, now
Black guy on Mad Men, I'm tellin y'all it's goin down
Ring around the Rozay, bitches love to fall down
Sober girls, broke niggaz, tell 'em that they're not allowed
It's on, it's on, yeah-yeah it's on {*3X*}â¨It's on, it's on, let me tell you how it's on

[Childish Gambino]
Who the fuck you think this bitch is leavin with?
Cause one of us is famous like "She and Him"
Wasn't cool in high school, but that's expected with geniuses
My music goes hard, bang shit like gay penises
My DJ be Sosupersam, she Asian, fuck that Klu Klux Klan
I love these clothes, that's who I am, my name mean fashion, Gucci Mane
We are not exclusive, I hope she understand me
Chris Brown pussy, it won't make it to the Grammys
Finally met your girlfriend, that is why her knees hurt
Been to hell and back and all I got this fuckin t-shirt
Laughing while mackin these hoes, vastly these rappers are slow
Askin to get back in the know when they're lackin a passionate flow
Trust in Gambino, he has never failed us
Cause I have got "S" plus what a dog's tail does
Read your blog, it says "Fuck that fag!"
I'm like LOL, hash tag rap
DC be spittin Jigga, he white but he my nigga
My shit be grown man, your shit be kitty litter
I always do it bigger... hah!
I always do it bigger... YAH!!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Thank you guys for 2010
I'll try and do it bigger in 2011
Heh, I love you! Hehehehe</pre>
