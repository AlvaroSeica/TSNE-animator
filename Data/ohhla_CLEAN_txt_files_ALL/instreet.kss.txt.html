[Intro]
Duane DaRock (I'm in the streets gettin money)
Jadakiss! Yeah (I'm in the streets gettin money) uh-huh
(I'm in the streets gettin mo-I'm in the streets gettin money)
AH-HAH~!

[sung]
I'm in these streets, hustlin every day
(I'm in the streets gettin money) {*3X*}

[Jadakiss]
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, yo
I'm on the block faithfully
Got it so good if I'm late they'll wait for me
Momma please pray for me (pray)
The devil does things in the worst ways
In the ER waiting to hear what the nurse say
I done paid more for funerals then birthdays
Finish a whole one and a half by Thursday (word)
So just imagine what I'm sittin with
And I ain't splittin it, I'm out here gettin it

[Chorus: sung]
I'm in these streets, I can't get away
(I'm in the streets gettin money) {*3X*}
I'm in these streets, hustlin every day
(I'm in the streets gettin money) {*3X*}

[Jadakiss]
Uh-huh, uh, yeah
Organization is smooth and ran with a tight lip
Get rid of the work and hold the bread with a tight grip
Trust fund baby in a cut with the white chick
Was in a choke hold, now it's in a vice grip (okay)
And even though my arm still strong with the dices
Drug dealer, I don't do jux or heists-es
The fame is aight but the game is priceless
My heart beatin but I'm still out here lifeless, what?

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Uhh uhh, uh-huh, yeah, yo
Start off with a wish if you wanna grant shit
I was never a worker, I always ran shit (true)
They was doin shells, I did the Stan Smiths
My hair used to be nappier than Durant's shit
Where they got the work at, and how much the grams is
Build it up to a ki', that's what the plan is (ready?)
You ain't got no fam, just you and your mans-es
Out here taking penitentiary chances, what?

[Chorus]

[Outro: sung]
I'm in these streets, I can't get away
I'm in these streets, hustlin every day</pre>
