[Intro]
Get it
Go, get it, go go, get it
Go, get it, go, get it
Go, get it, go go, get it

[Kid Ink]
Uhh~! First off
Eat a dick, try to tell me I ain't work hard
Where I'm from yeah, I could be worst off
Life was a bitch, it was her loss
but I made it through the pain like a tattoo
Turned me to a young nigga with a attitude
What it do? Ain't shit changed
Westside; you know the fuckin name
It's Kid Ink baby, came real far
Back then yeah they used to call me rock star
I'm still a rock star, two fingers up
... like, one just ain't enough
Uhh, fuck the world now we makin love
Been doin this shit you niggaz makin up
Fast life full shift, never breakin up
I got bars nigga, never breakin up
... You hear me? Mmm
Yeah

[Chorus]
We came a long way from nothin
Made it through it all so it must be somethin
Better get ready, tell 'em we comin
Never back down, even when they all frontin
I gotta get mine - get it, go, get it
Go, get it, go go, get it
I gotta get mine - go, get it, go, get it
Go, get it, go go, get it

[Kid Ink]
Yeah~! Cause they ain't gon' give it to me
Take shots, but they ain't send 'em to me
Want somethin done right better do it nigga
On the wild ride with a bunch of fluids in us
Been lettin niggaz slide like a playground
Anyone want it tell them there's enough to go around
Yo - it's goin down
Beef ain't nothin but a quarter pound
Uhh, and I'm ill, cancer
Gonna bust a move like a Soul Train dancer
Yeah I'm on they heads, antlers
Can you feel the fire? Campers
You already know who I roll with
Alumni, Bat Gang, better get focused
Uhh, they all lookin hopeless
Just tell 'em they can hold this, uhh
... Yeah

[Chorus]

[Nipsey Hussle]
As the marathon continues, you already know
Believe that, I'ma leave that place
No opinions if I ain't ask for yo' feedback
Look - nigga, we that; Stevie Wonder can see that
All of these shows sell out and all of my hoes to see that wait
Niggaz relax, I'm an insomniac
Drop a tape go on tour before they miss us, we back
Real - nigga respect, anywhere that we be at, still
Niggas special when reach the level we at, kill
Jealous niggaz cashed the chance but we gon be that, still
Cash rules everything and nigga we got bills
I sit back kickin pockets with two stacks
Play with me wrong, I promise you get leaked - too fast
Yeah, y'all seen that, set out then we achieved that
Built the shit up from nothin now ballin us my reflex, nigga
Where yo' team at? Baby got where you be at
We killin competition, no condolence, get the Kleenex, oh!
Pissing on pots at the repass
Full time grind, no recess
Expensive-ass pussy if I need that
Baby suckin so good I'm like damn, where yo' teeth at?
What? Somethin, ready, ready, I'm ready, mine, mine

[Chorus]

[Outro]
UHHHH!</pre>
