Song:   You Already Know
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus - 2X]
I'm chilling with my broad, and you already know
And if you wanna reach me, hit me on the down low
If I don't call back, don't put on a show
When I pass by your house and blow, instead of knocking on your do'

[H.A.W.K.]
You know that opposites attract, and hoes choose macs
And how some girls act, when playas don't call em back
Why is that, is it cause I'm hard to ignore
The kind of man you adore, but already spoken for
Or, are you caught up in the fame
Holding your head in shame, cause you don't know my real name
Who's to blame, cause it ain't my fault
It's another lesson taught, when you fucking with H.A.W.K.
Caught up in the rapture, wasn't hard to catch you
With my heavy weight frame and my 6-4 stature
I snatched you, whatever this game planned
Wanted me to be a man, but I had other plans
It was a one night stand, now the shit hit the fan
Everytime you see a nigga, you wanna hold my hand
Girl you don't understand, that you not my type
I got a wife, and you're just my late night hype

[Chorus - 2X]

[H.A.W.K.]
Now I admit I was wrong, for leading you on
The long talks on the phone, you thought our bond was strong
But my woman's at home, so girl leave me alone
And all the plans you had for us, they been postponed
Now I ain't being rude, I'm just a type of dude
Buy you a little food, and get you into the mood
Now we're both in the nude, catching an attitude
Acting crude and shrude, and showing no gratitude
You broke all the rules, and I'm glad I peeped it
You couldn't be like Victoria, and keep this secret
You wasting your time, cause you star 69
but the cell phone I called you on, ain't even mine
It was strictly bump and grind, cause that's how I play
You said you didn't mind, so I behaved this way
It was just the other day, when you said this
And why you think I act funny, when you ask for a kiss
(you silly bitch)

[Chorus - 2X]

[H.A.W.K.]
Now you rubbing me, kissing and hugging me
Infatuated with the thug in me
You say you loving me, the situation's getting ug-ly
Got your partnas mean mugging me
Girl you bugging me, getting on my last nerve
And then you wonder why, you got kicked to the curb
You puzzled like crosswords, and asking me to choose
Either you or my wife, girl you know you'd lose
Now your ass got the blues, rich goody to-shoe
Sitting there all confused, feeling like you been used
Your privilege is world view, and now you know
Instead of knocking on your do, I'ma pass by and blow
Gotta go gotta go, gotta chill with my broad
So I toots my horn, since you been acting fraud
I hit you with the raw, and you went outrageous
Should of warned you though, that my love is contagious

[Chorus - 2X]</pre>
