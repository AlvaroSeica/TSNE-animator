[Intro: Rick Ross] (Wale) (*Maybach Music Sample)
She's Self Made, I'm Self Made (Work!)
We're made for each other, feel me (*M-M-M-MAYBACH MUSIC!)

[Verse One: Rick Ross]
They callin me the hottest in the game
Never the gold, I wanted gold plated chains
Have sex on a highway in the Lexxus
Suck her neck before I eat her like she's breakfast
Never mind the rumors baby this is me and you
Belle Harbor ballin fifty on them pretty shoes
With foreign names, valet the range
Different positions, but she still moanin the same
Milli on my neck, thumbin through that check
Rozay in effect, know how to make her wet
Roses by the dozen, everyday I'm hustlin
Blowin money fast lookin like I'm savin nothin
Let's take another trip, different continents we touchin
Niggas gettin flipped, I get 'em done for nothin
Shoutout to Joe and Chris, It's A.P. on my wrist
I'm still seein bricks like it's still eighty six
Over twenty homes, but I need a chick
And she got the bomb, I'm talkin tick tick
She got the bomb, I'm talkin tick tick
And if you feel I'm wrong, baby you should tell me this

[Chorus: Chris Brown] (*Rick Ross) (**Wale)
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
(*You can't tell me shit!)
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
(*Double M number one clique, baby girl hold me close)
(*It's the boss, overdose!)
'Cause in the end girl your gonna want another round
(Another Round) another round (Another Round) another round
Girl your gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her with her
(**My infiniti rose baby girl)
I used to want you and her and her and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you
(**I knew you before I knew you, that's love!)

[Chris Brown &amp; Fat Joe]
Shorty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
The bitch badder than any bitch that you name

[Fat Joe] (Wale)
I'm talkin Janet, maybe Kim K, I heard Rihanna, she like it kinky
(Uh! Ralph! Double M! Genius!)
Come on!

[Verse Two: Wale]
Listen! Uno papi chulo 'bout to show you what you have been missin
Sex is just a weapon I can leave you wet from this pistol
I cannot believe you think you young and trippin
Why you tryin to read me if you see there isn't any issues
Double MG, Wale she call me OLou
At a Polo with no logo apoptosis like four o's
Let's have a toast for this new love
I scoop you up, in like two sum'n
Truthfully don't do much, but with you tryin to do sum'n
(Work!) Poetic genius (Work!) My home a scenic
(Work!) My latest feature probably got these haters grievin
At the same time have their lady geekin 
Clearly piss them off without no store then ten eighty peein
And my kick game beyond crazy
Clark Kent, Fat Joe, the only ones that may phase me
Ain't no badder swimmin then the ocean of your lady
We way beyond haters we just finished Self Made 3

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
'Cause in the end girl your gonna want another round
(Another Round) another round (Another Round) another round
Girl your gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her with her
I used to want you and her and her and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you

[Chris Brown &amp; Fat Joe]
Shorty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
The bitch badder than any bitch that you name

[Fat Joe]
I'm talkin Janet, maybe Kim K, I heard Rihanna, she like it kinky
Come on!

[Verse Three: Stalley]
And I'm a be honest, she's the flyest here
Her shoe game is everything heels Nike ten
All the ladies bad, their dresses cashmere
She glammed up behind the eyeliner I know there's tears
She seem a little brave, but I sense the fear
Her defense is up I'm wishin that it disappears 
I'm wishin that she listens up 'cause this is years
Of her materialize love for one who doesn't care
She say all men treat her the wrong way (The wrong way)
Yeah, I know, that's what they all say (What they all say)
But I get you, I bang with you the long way
And we got history, let's repeat it the right way

[Chorus: Chris Brown] (*Stalley)
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
(*Another round is what the song say!)
Don't you be holdin back your love don't you be holdin back
'Cause in the end girl your gonna want another round
(Another Round) another round (Another Round) another round
Girl your gonna want another round, another round
I used to want you and her and her and her and you with her with her
I used to want you and her and her and her
All I want, all I want, all I want is you

[Chris Brown &amp; Fat Joe]
Shorty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
The bitch badder than any bitch that you name

[Fat Joe]
I'm talkin Janet, maybe Kim K, I heard Rihanna, she like it kinky
Come on!</pre>
