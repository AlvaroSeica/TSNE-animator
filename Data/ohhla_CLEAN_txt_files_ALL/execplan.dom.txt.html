[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yo, you got my money, man?
Yo... how much you owe me now, nigga
It's been a couple of weeks, man, stop playing, man
Come out your fucking pocket...

[Dom Pachino]
I'm a business man, so expect executive plan
So commercial radio gon' be playing my jams
Got ways to make paper, finally found my nitch
When I cop a skyscraper, they consider me rich
I pity a snitch, new city is this, the gritiest
Off the block, where it's hot, and the lungies'll spit
The grungiest shit, gun runners, sons being hit
Burst it at Columbian, you know we gotta keep it coming in
And New York is where I'm coming from, son, bums and bubble gum
Bitches, on the block, giving head to the number one
Dealer on the scene, if you know what I mean
I make green and blow green like a boat that steam
You ain't walk my walk, you ain't talk my talk
You ain't been in my mind, you ain't think that thought
You ain't built like I'm built, you ain't build that fort
I'm that kid Dom P., it's the kid from New York
Yes, I'm outspoken, plus I'm not joking
Niggas better stop joking, before they get flipped like a token
Heads up, you know the feds be up
Me, I'm in the studio, getting my flow tight
And them thicks, they be listening all night
Sorry, boys, got a warrant, I'm bout to catch a flight... </pre>
