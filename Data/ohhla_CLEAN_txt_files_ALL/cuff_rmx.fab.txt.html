[Intro: sample of Bobby Vinton's "Sealed With A Kiss"]
"Though we gotta say goodbye, for the summer..  baby, I promise you this
I'll send you all my love, everyday, in a letter.. sealed with a kiss" {"Sonaro"}

[Chorus] + (Fabolous)
These hoes keep callin', I ain't pickin' up (yeah)
These hoes keep callin', I ain't pickin' up (yeah)
Told these hoes I'll be back around June (around June)
Told these hoes I'll be back around June (WHAT?!)
Better yet I'll change my numbers for the whole winter (who?)
Damn, it's so cold in the fuckin' winter (whooo)
These hoes keep callin', I ain't pickin' up (what)
Damn, I'm so cold in the fuckin' winter (yeah)

[Verse One: Fabolous]
You gon' be at La Marina all summer (facts)
So you gon' hear this remix all summer (facts)
Nigga, fuck your #WomenCrushWednesday (hashtag)
I just fucked your #WomenCrushWednesday
Wasn't even Wednesday (nah) nigga, it was Benz day
He like "Why you ridin' with him?" she like "We just friends, BAAAAABE!"
Before anyone else? Please (ooh)
You ain't got no man, all your pics selfies (ohh yeah)
I be takin' wealthies, ballin' in my pictures (for the thots)
You be fightin' over hoes, Spalding on them bitches (for the thots)
Frontin' money, could've gotten behind it for free
I got this pretty one in Cali, Thotiana Ali (nice)
I got a New York Dominican, plastic cup body (nice)
Mami think she Holly, call her tatted up Dadi (nice)
Got a crew in Miami, I call them Thot Angels
Even if he wife you he cannot change you, BIATCH!

[Chorus] + (Fabolous)
These hoes keep callin', I ain't pickin' up (yeah)
These hoes keep callin', I ain't pickin' up (yeah)

Told these hoes I'll be back around June (WHAT?!)
Better yet I'll change my numbers for the whole winter (who?)
Damn, it's so cold in the fuckin' winter (whooo)
These hoes keep callin', I ain't pickin' up (what)
Damn, I'm so cold in the fuckin' winter (yeah)

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
I move right, steppin with the German on me
So much beef I gotta party with the burner on me
My chain chunky, my wrists all chunky
My pockets all chunky, chunk ya bitch want me HAAAA?!
Quit cuffin' you love her, she want the limelight
She 'bout to get ya in some shit boy get ya mind right
Sparkle after sparkle when the bottles come
She got a nice set of tits glad you bought her some
Startin the bartender they'll  be in Perfections
Turned up for lust, heard they fucked with Gus
In Sin City I'll fuck with them them hoes pretty
Substitute Fiddy, I'm fillin in for Biggie
Now watch a model chick turn into a bottle chick
You hit the lotto bitch swimmin Â‘round my grotto pit
Don't call it Tyson crib this is my estate
And that's old money bitch I'm gettin cake

[Chorus] + (Fabolous)
These hoes keep callin', I ain't pickin' up (yeah)
These hoes keep callin', I ain't pickin' up (yeah)
Told these hoes I'll be back around June (around June)
Told these hoes I'll be back around June (WHAT?!)
Better yet I'll change my numbers for the whole winter (who?)
Damn, it's so cold in the fuckin' winter (whooo)
These hoes keep callin', I ain't pickin' up (what)
Damn, I'm so cold in the fuckin' winter (yeah)</pre>
