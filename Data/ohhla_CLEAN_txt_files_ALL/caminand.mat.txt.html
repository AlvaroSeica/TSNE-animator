If I could save you from hell, and help you break those chains
I'd take you out the rain and I would place no blame
You saw the world change, and it was you that was the same
And you did anything and everything you could to kill the pain
You sat completely cold in toss dying of an overdose
Your mother held the rosary, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost
And after all of this, everyone was there for you
And even though you lost hope, I always said a pray for you
May not seem fair to you, you had to see your brother die
But every time you smile, know he's smiling from the other side
And God knows I tried to get you to understand
But you and your foolish pride turned away my helping hand
And out of this raw deal, I learned that faith is for real
And you can't play God, and some scars will never heal
I learned that life is short, and you can't change anybody
You've gotta save yourself, cause you can't save everybody

I wonder what you're gonna say, when the game's all over
I wonder what you're gonna say, when the game's all over
You see, times moves on, and young men grow older
You see, times moves on, and young men grow older
And without God, your empty heart will only grow colder
And without God, your empty heart will only grow colder
But wise words fall on deaf ears, and cold shoulders
But wise words fall on deaf ears, and cold shoulders

If I had the patience of Job and the innocence of Jesus
Then I'd spend a million years with you just picking up the pieces
I'd stay through every season and I'd hold you to my chest
And we'd be one with our breath, with a love sure as death
I'd put you in that dress, and finally give you chance to use it
I'd sing you silly songs, and you could dance to the music
Nah, I would never abuse it, I'd always be your home
And I would give you my name, and take your pain for my own
And you would never be alone, whenever trouble comes around
(Boo, I'm right here) A single tear would never touch the ground
I'd tear your fears down, and say you found salvation
And I'd build you a kingdom on a solid foundation
It can't rain forever, it only takes time
The night has to end, and let the bright day shine
We could have drank whine all day, and watched our garden grow
It could have been tomorrow too, we didn't have that far to go

I hate to see you cry, but I love it when you cry for me
I hate to see you cry, but I love it when you cry for me
I told you life is comedy, you gotta love the irony
I told you life is comedy, you gotta love the irony
Just know, I'll always be a part of you, you'll always be a part of me
Just know, I'll always be a part of you, you'll always be a part of me
But no matter how much I believe, I gotta leave all apologies
No matter how much I believe, I gotta leave all apologies

Sub sanity, the one jewel in every broken family
Has everything to gain, has aid to everything for vanity
I'll always sing with you, sharing the last of my chips
I don't have much, but giving all I have, makes me rich
And something to believe in, while I try to keep you smiling
To humble beginnings, sad endings and new horizons
And what we learned turned to grief, the knowledge lead to sorrow
But the way it is today it doesn't have to be tomorrow
And thank you for the cigarettes, and walking in the rain with me
I'll reimburse you fully when they finally give my change to me
Madness look at this, the beauty of it all amazes me
Sometimes you got me cornering, this wandering is aimlessly
They give the prays to me, but I just wanna pack and go
Walk like I don't have a home, acting like I have to roam
And leave the ninety-nine and look for the one
And simply not come back home until I'm done

Just chase in the wind, trying hard to stay high
Just chase in the wind, trying hard to stay high
I pray for a place in the sun, and all I got was grey skies
I pray for a place in the sun, and all I got was grey skies
Cause in Eden, I try to break even with the great wives
In Eden, I try to break even with the great wives
And lost it all to my paradise and rolled snake eyes</pre>
