Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I recall everything I was told
Boy you'll never live to be 18 years old
Dead or incarcerated just like those
People who wonder down similar roads
Leavin out the house
She said please don't go
Granny why you steady tryin ta save my soul
If death is my destiny like you had said to me
Let me get busy before he gets the best of me
Don't you know bullets don't have no brain
And alot of youngings don't have no aim
Am I living or dying somebody please explain
Goin or staying because I'm going insane
I'm strapped up cause he is
Shishty cause she is
Meanwhile dude who teach chemistry is
In his office with a kid doing shit I get expelled for
Which makes me wonder why people go to jail for it

[Chorus 2X]
Even if I did die young so what
Nobody expected me to ever grow up
Grandmama lectured me you better grow up
But there wasn't no telling me I was a grown up

[Verse 2]
I'm a kid peeping in justice yall let slide
But your so quick to point out mine
That's what made me draw that line
Blinded by my own design
I'm doing fine, no I'm not I'm doing bad
But I'm so afraid to talk
Yall got shit going on
I don't wanna bother yall
Pops cut from a different cloth
Never be the man that he was
Thought I was slow, I turned out to be a genius
And I ain't returned like eat my peanuts
Let my our bank statements be the difference between us
If I seem distant, bitch I'm 30 something
I was suppose to been done been a murder victim
My grandpa prayed until his knees gave way
If you can't save me, God please save Jason
The way I went in that's the only explanation
I know some bad dudes enough to know I ain't one

[Chorus 2X]
Even if I did die young so what
Nobody expected me to ever grow up
Grandmama lectured me you better grow up
But there wasn't no telling me I was a grown up

[Verse 3]
I was confused and you can hear it in my rhetoric
In retrospect I never should have made it back
I wrote my Senator and never got a letter back
My friend Chris got killed for a Cadillac
My man Mike died for a powder pack
So understand why I could think I was next
Under attack guns and crack
Or the mother fuckin police shoot us in the back
And ah, they think it only happens to blacks
And refuse to believe it almost happened to Stak
Stabbed in the back
Blood beating threw a heart filled with crack
Soldier up fought through that
Injuries alot of players don't walk off
I walked off cause I ain't the type to walk off
If you family your suppose to love me when I'm wrong
Be a man and represent me when I'm gone
Stones in a foundation get looked over
But without them the whole damn house falls over
This is for the rocks that exist beneath me
The block which gave me a past to be me
BB's are baby bullets, babies are in training
My people were bangin before they called it bangin
Just chillin, hangin, words exchange
One thing lead to another, all I heard was [gun shot]

[Chorus 2X]
Even if I did die young so what
Nobody expected me to ever grow up
Grandmama lectured me you better grow up
But there wasn't no telling me I was a grown up</pre>
