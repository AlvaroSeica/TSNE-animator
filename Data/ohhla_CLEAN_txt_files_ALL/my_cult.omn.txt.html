Song:   My Culture
Typed by: iamomni dot com

I know the science recongnize the humble lion
babies in the jungle crying some are grown
some are trying all my people keep fighting
await the main feature stay awake we need ya
gods creature think deeper battle temptation
mind excercise memorize the pages patience determination
life self ezxplainatory skill is mandatory
swinging the sword stuck in the ground we found glory

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
you don't really want to fuck with me
when it comes to my culture, comes my people, my freedom

I rap for the world in my eyes we are all equal
I'm cool with evrybody but I love my people
that need me alive my will to survive is high
if you take a look deep inside my eyes
you'll find the sounds of a thousand drums beating at once
with the hunger of a man who hasnt eating in months I'm sick
I hold the mic with a serious grip I'm the shit you
I promise not to let you out of my sight it will be alright

[Chorus]

all energy combined with the sun and the earth
opens the door for creeation a mother gives birth
contractions family tree sprout branches
instinct its the universal law of expansion
were more powerful then any limitation
face with keep it in rotation different stages phases
philosophers queens kings sisters and brothers
the greatest of successors gravitate to one another

[Chorus]</pre>
