Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Do you wanna hear a love story?
Well once upon a time, there was a girl

All she ever did was pick out the scars that he left her
On her heart
And she bleed reliving the sweet words in terrible hurt
She gave him her heart
And so did he
But when he ripped the cords between his and hers
She fell to her knees in disbelief

[Chorus]
And she was drowning in the middle of his ocean
She loved him and she was drowning
He drowned her in her sorrows
But he's scared to love another
But he drowned her
And now he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love

Blue eyes
Red lips
Pale skin

He left her
Standing in the middle of the street
Yes he left her
As she cried out so desperately
And he dropped her
As she fell into his trap
He could never let go of that
But he caught her
But as soon as she got up
He pushed her away

[Chorus]
And she was drowning in the middle of his ocean
She loved him and she was drowning
He drowned her in her sorrows
But he's scared to love another
But he drowned her
And now he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love

I dropped a tear in the ocean
And the day that you find it
I'll stop loving you, loving you
His eyes stole me with truth
but he's words fed me with lies

And by that time

[Chorus]
And she was drowning in the middle of his ocean
She loved him and she was drowning
He drowned her in her sorrows
But he's scared to love another
But he drowned her
And now he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love</pre>
