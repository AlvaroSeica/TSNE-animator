{"Marijuanaaaaaaa!"}

[Yelawolf]
Twenty pounds in the trunk
Momma been growin that skunk
Green room looks like a war zone
Dirty water drips from the hydro pumps
Daddy got me sweepin leaves
Pickin up shake, makin tea
Brownies, cookies, servin all the hippies
Nickel sacks, bet, hit me
Dixie boy, smoker's toy
Paraphernalia, you enjoy
Grow it, pack it, then deploy
Summertime job come get employed
Evidence destroyed
Family biz evidently boy
Duckin the police boy

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
All for the love of {"Marijuanaaaaaaa!"}
Roll it up, cut it down
Pack it up, pass it around
Everybody loves some {"Marijuanaaaaaaa!"}
Makes you happy, feelin stupid
Girls get horny, when they use it
Everybody smokes some {"Marijuanaaaaaaa!"}

[Yelawolf]
Can't get caught by the Rosco
So we stuffin this green like a taco
Feelin like we hit a brick lotto
Puttin dents in the street like a pothole
We pot hold, in the backwoods
Two-tone box Chevy with the black hood
Seats come out all backed up
P's for the 18 like a Mack truck
You a dope boy? So what!
If I gave you my connect you'd blow up
Sawed-off layin flat on the sofa
They'll twist that lid like a soda
Uncle Critter puttin plugs on the motor
We gotta get to Tennessee, no hold ups
We ain't gettin rich bitch, we gettin over

[Chorus]

[Yelawolf]
Crowbar sits in the carjack
Fill the gas tank up with a fun pack
Son I don't wanna see you 'til you come back
If you get caught you know where the money's at
Throwin loose rocks on a dirt road
Police on your throat like a chokehold
Rollin through town with a boatload
I'm feelin like a trailer park mogul
Sweat can't roll down the windows
cause the door's jammed up with the elbows
I think I see cops, I can't tell though
If I ride too close they'll smell dope
My phone blowin up, I promise
They waitin on the package from the runner
I made enough just for the summer

[Chorus]</pre>
