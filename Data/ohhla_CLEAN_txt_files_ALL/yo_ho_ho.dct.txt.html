[here we go]

Yo ho ho, I'm good to go
Hypin' on the mic cause god said so
He said, "yo, go out and fish for men"
A genuine commission that put us in
To tell you about our savior and lord
So if you wonder what's up well, you're in store
For more than a happy, go-lucky tune
About christmas and how it's coming soon
This song will tell ya how it all began
And how man [oh man] seemed to change that plan
Know this to be true in black and white
God's word said so so you know that's right
It's christmas time

[Chorus]
Yo! ho! ho! ho! [repeat 3X]
We're good to go
[repeat 2X]

A benz pulled up figured it was dis
So on twelve twenty-fifth give me all the gifts
I mean, each year christmas rolls around
For mucho gifts the t was down
[from] stereo, mixers, to microphones
I caused pops to take ridiculous loans
Until a few years back I attended a play
About christmas and it went this way:
People were illin' all across the land
It was tax season and the king had a plan
He sent all the people back to where they were born
For a census which I'm sure they adored
As we move down the line things start to get hairy
God chose joseph and a virgin named mary
By this time I was on the edge of my pew
But hold up I gotta break for a few

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's christmas time
And all the gifts I find
But true love is
Found in jesus christ
Gloria
[it ain't jingle bells, baby]

Mary was a virgin but laden with child
Yo doc! [yes?] ponder that for a while
They grabbed a couple of mules started across the land
Their destination was called bethlehem
Ya know, night had fallen they arrived in a fix
Cause every inn was full even motel 6 [word!]
They got it goin' on in the west side of town
It wasn't quite home but they had a bed down
On this very night she delivered a babe
It was a boy [god's son] comin' into the world to save
And unbind mankind from a serious debt
Called sin that god couldn't forget
Without sendin' his son as a gift to man
He lived to be thirty-three and then died
For the plan of salvation so the choice is yours
The true gift of christmas ain't found in stores

Yo, where's little drummer boy?

[Chorus]</pre>
