[Chali 2na]
Like that like that ya don't stop, check it
One mo' time for the people out there
It goes peace -- if you come to see me rebel
2na-Fish'll come ready like I was Edie Brickell
I'm everlasting, never will my head expand
This Publisher is Clearinghouse like I'm Ed McMahon
I getcha -- open like a bullet wound, test the repoitoire
and I'll connect a right cross to your upper jaw
I'm on my toes, all my foes beware
cause 2na-Fish'll tackle flows like I'm Rosie Grier, yeah
Forgot to tell you the response is choice
Comin to smother the brother with the monster voice
It's gonna -- wipe slow specimen I got the hype
so listen in lyrical nitro-glycerin
We pack a punch like a earthquake set
Comin through your {fuckin} tapedeck is how we shake {shit}
So all you {bitch-ass} brothers take shelter
or you'll be on my conveyor belt when I melt ya
It's like that, one two for J-5
Let me tell you that we, make it live, gray-la-hey
Breathin in and out lung style, huh
Mr. Canibus, won'tcha funk it up for a while</pre>
