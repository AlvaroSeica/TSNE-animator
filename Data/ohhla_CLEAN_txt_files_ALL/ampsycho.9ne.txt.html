[B.o.B]
I see you loo-king at me
Loo-king at me, so I ask

[Chorus]
Am I a psycho?
Am I a psycho?
Yeah, I'm a psycho
I guess I'm a psycho

[Tech N9ne]
You're crazy - I like you, but you're crazy, my tours paid me
So I used that dough to allure ladies to manure bathe me
Never that, my mind's for sure shady, pure Hades
Rev X steady couldn't endure to save me
Why did I let this stripper burn me on the arm with a cigarette
in the same spot ten times in a row, when I felt that burn upon the clitoris
I'ma get her wet, sorry to get carried away
I feel stupid cause I ain't did her yet
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts
I get vexed when I ain't bit her neck
open, I try to contain it but that dame thang's soaking
Alter ego say why you let them gang bang folk in?
Strange lane, hoping I can maintain coping
But ain't nobody talking when the insane mayne spoken
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
from up in her walls, I'm suffering, I'm stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffing and puffing, hollering, I'm a dog
Afterwards I like really hot scalding water on my balls

[Chorus]

[Hopsin]
Mom? Dad? I'm no longer the boy you're used to seeing
I've changed a lot, plus I've grown to hate every human being
My mood swings have now turned my dreams into gruesome scenes
Now I'm doing things I don't normally do, when illusions seem
to be the only pleasures I can gain, heck, if I was sane
I would have put down the mic and said fuck it, I'll never rise to fame
But with the wicked records I contain, I could probably jeopardize your name
No lovey-dovey, let's ignite the flame, if you're lucky you'll survive the pain
Sorry that ain't very merry to say, why is this game so scary to play?
Well, let me think, cause every day my balls are getting too hairy to shave
Pause a minute, I'm stressing the game, if I go to Hell then Heaven's to blame
I don't mean to come off crazy, but you motherfuckers seem to think I'm hella deranged
When I was seven years old, I fell on my head and I severed my brain
You think I'm lying? Then ask my mama nigga, she can tell you the same
Should I be ashamed? No, I'm living my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent out of shape my nigga, let me ask you this

[Chorus]

[B.o.B]
I stab you with this mic and rap this verse I'm rapping to you
Matter of fact, I'm rapping through you
Never say my motherfucking name unless you absolutely have to
I am not no fucking jacket with no matching shoes and you are not no fashion guru
Can't even see you niggas, y'all wish I was rapping to you
Matter of fact, act like I'm rapping to you if that gives you
passion to use this as an excuse, then just jump up at a conclusion
that I'm attacking you dudes, it's just like old fashion voodoo
Y'all ain't even the shit, no y'all ain't even the doodoo
I got more flavor on the tissue paper under my Toobos
So I'm slapping you foolish with wooden paddles, you stupid
Baby-sitting little bastards like little afternoon children
You could call me psychotic, but it's more like schizophrenic
And I can speak, can anyone tell me just where my medicine is?
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Man I swear I'm all up out my brain like graduate students
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings
I see your tears, come here, give me your face, let me clear it
But I wonder how it would look if I woulda peel it back with a skillet
Then I'ma feel it crack when I hit it and then I'ma split it back when you ill it
Damn it Bobby boy, what in the Hell? What in the Heaven?
What in the earth? Where is you mom? What, are you cursed? Where are you from?
Where was your birth? Where were you first? Why wasn't you in church?
Why is there dirt, all on your shirt?
Man, now I think that you're going berserk

[Chorus: 2X]</pre>
