[Intro: Proof]
Why you actin like I don't know y'all?
Tryna tell me I don't know y'all?
Hehehehe, aight
 
[Proof]
Your niggaz is young, your niggaz is bums
Your niggaz is weak, your niggaz is HOES...
Your niggaz is bitch, your niggaz is snitch
Your nigga done flipped, your nigga is GONE...
Your niggaz is scared, your niggaz is shook
Your soldier is drunk, your soldiers is WRONG...
Your niggaz is moved, your niggaz is beat
Your niggaz retreat, your niggaz is GONE!
 
Shit, now I'm the first to pull it, so bullets is useless
A Proof diss I heard is stupid
The truth is reality is mine, wanna battle me for shine
Don't make daddy paddle that behind
{?} bound soakin mics at night with daytime
Contemplate on your fate and play God
Easy to run over the peasly with measly bucks
I'm Roy Jones, who wanna beat me up? (C'MON~!)
Squeezin butts on pesty children
Get a Western Union to hit at your next reunion
Didn't think I'll be back again this quick
I'm a African sick lip, blastin a biscuit
Harassin your district, put my mag on your bitch lips (shut up)
Killers want that ass like fags with stiff dicks
In a Jag with my mistress
Blab{?} while your interest and lashes repent this
 
[Chorus: Proof]
Walk with many often times
Make the enemy's paws recline
With the pressures you done lost your mind, no caution dyin
Motherfucker you done crossed the line
 
[Proof]
Don't need fingerprints who smaller than the average
Vince Carter of this rappin shit, harder than actin scripts
Get caught up with acrid hits, from out the Smith and the Wesson
In town he was found with his chest pressed in
Proof is so-so on tracks, most of the crap 
that sells make you think fans all smokin the crack
Open the facts, Jigga's the baller and Pac's the thug
Biggie's the king, Shady's an act of drug
Nas is the truth, The Lox is the block
D-12 is slept on, 50 is hot, miss me or NOT!
I'm back for respect, love and war
Put blood on Source and the fool's in person to hug the Lord
Tell Bugz I'm raw and I'll see him soon
Needin room, I'm deep as a bleedin womb
proceedin through the trenches with a message until I exit
You best respect it for credit I'll leave you headless
 
[Chorus]
 
{*scratched*: "Walk with many, walk with many, walk with many often times"}
{*scratched*: "Walk with many, walk with many.."}
[Proof] Motherfucker you done crossed the line
 
[Chorus]
 
{*scratches to the end*}</pre>
