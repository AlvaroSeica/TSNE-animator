[Verse 1]
Seek nemesis responsible for crisis
with heat sensitive optical devices		
It's bleak, perilous, horrible and high risk
Elite specialist who's locked in duel with tyrant		
Topple you with sidekick, there's plenty sorrow
Phenomenal, precise with semi auto				
Many follow but I lead, very
Macho a live breed, get buried poncho you'll die, bleed	
I mind read like professor xavier
Sever and slay ya, The successor is greater		
Desolate chamber at ground zero
Weathered the danger, a proud hero				
Master who's skillful, channel is spiritual
None can scramble the signal
The math is deep, I thought of the machinations
Sat in the seat of slaughter and desolation		

[Chorus]
"The predator, In level 4 armor
The dreaded Lord, competitors cornered		
Your henchmen fall, my weapon cause trauma
It's death and gore, you met the war monger"

[Verse 2]
Many deaths and there's bodies counted
wear a vest with the molle pouches		
Deadly threat with the army outfit
Cap and field jacket, blast 
The steel ratchet aftermath is real graphic				
Surreal, tragic, there's bloodshed
Concealed barracks, with bunk beds					
Hunt heads, Rogue agent, foes are hung
Punks fled, know their base was overrun			
The is game over, done, you expire
The flame thrower gun will set fires					
Quite relaxed as I wade through rival's traps
Strike, attack as you race for rifle rack			
First responders, search for the merciless
Bomber, lurk I'm the worst a monster				
Ninja gets hostile, obey colonel's plans
Infrared goggles, engage thermal scan			

[Chorus]
"The predator, in level 4 armor
The dreaded Lord, competitors cornered		
Your henchmen fall, my weapon cause trauma
It's death and gore, you met the war monger"
