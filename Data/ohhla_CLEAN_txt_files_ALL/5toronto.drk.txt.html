[Drake]
Yeah...
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, y'know...
For my niggaz, though..

Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got er'rybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
..You prol'ly wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggaz make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga!
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein +Frank+ witcha
I mean, where ya think she at when she ain't witcha?
Whylin, doin shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin my drive, I never give it a break/brake
Give these niggaz the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake
Straight, +Y Pree+? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin our words like it's wire taps on the team
Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggaz
Guess it's funny how money could make change outta niggaz
F'real, some nobody started feelin himself
A couple somebodies started killin themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits woulda popped if I was willin to help
I got, a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is comin
A lot of niggaz PR stuntin like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music
I swear, FUCK them niggaz this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
FUCK your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stayed in this shit, it's a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eat it like I'm seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
+Nothing Was The Same+, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Kareem, this shit for Jevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop and I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggaz just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin live from the Screwface, livin out a suitcase
But I'm feelin good, Johnny got me pushin two plates
My weight up, I refuse to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe!
Niggaz treat me like I've been here for ten
Some niggaz been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryin to win here again
A young nigga tryin to win here again, man what's up?

Ay... Yeah
A young nigga tryin to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin witcha boy, I got her fucked up, shawty
Awwwwwwww yeah</pre>
