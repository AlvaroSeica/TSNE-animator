Devil's eyes, I can see them when they scream
At night, living with me in my dreams
You either love everything, you either love everything
Am I right, There is no other way
To fight, everything I have to say
You either love everything, you either love everything

There's a sound that we make when we sleep
Around, walking through it like a trance
Unhappy movements in your eyes, unhappy movements in your eyes
Happens fast, never planned out in your mind
To last, people want but can't decide
Unhappy movements in your eyes, unhappy movements in your eyes</pre>
