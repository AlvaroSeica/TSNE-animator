Song:   Mean and Vicious
Typed by: jaysscholar@gmail.com

He's meannnnnn and vicious
I can't believe he's that rude
To those stories those rhymes that jewel
Then he put them on the floor like cat food
And put them on the track like glue
Then put them on your head like hat
Hey back to you Lu, black power
I'm just running with a barrel full of black powder
With a hole in it, holding it, wheezing deep, breathing
Running from the fire on the trail I keep leaving
I can't shake it I swear it's heat seeking
I keep seeking somewhere to hide from it, duck and dive from it
But it keep keeping up just when I think that I've done it
It keep sneaking up
Ohh leaking barrel of black powder how that flame keep reaching us
Just one of the long winded extended metaphors of Lu's
This time I use an example of a fuse
To demonstrate how I can't lose
I would put it down but I can't due to the glue
That I use the fuse everything together
Well I spill some on my hands
And goddamn I might have to carry this forever
Well I'm crazy to the game till they bury me insane

[Chorus]
There once was a boy that grew up on the west side of chicago
Liked his hat to the left side
Wasn't in a gang but he was prone to bang
doing his thang, doing his thang
There once was a boy that grew up on the west side of chicago
Liked his hat to the left side
Wasn't in a gang but he was known to bang
doing his thang, doing his thang

Truthfully I have trouble with second versus
Cuz the first one be so intimidating
It be bullying and picking on it, instigating
Pointing out all the second one's limitations
Like you ain't nothing but an imitation
Like bits of bacon, then he gets the chorus
And the beat to get together then they all gang up on him and get to hating
But then around the 8th bar he tires
Of their conspiring and comiseratin g
Then he find his inspiration to spar 
He takes a few seconds of judo lessons
Gets back on beat then punches the guitar
They stand in awe like when did you write that
They ain't even right, black
First verse already happened so he don't have a chance to fight back
I like that
Abagnale Junior, check me
You going to respect me
Alright track, listen to him feeling himself
Swagger up and a few ad libs to back it up
Lets back it up
I think you've had enough
Give me my mic back
You ain't even write that
Oh it's like that?
Track stop pumping till this nigga stop fronting
[beat stops]
Yeah, yeah, now write back
[beat continues]

[Chorus]

Oh my god, my perils and my odds
I ain't really here, what you hear is a mirage
This ain't the delivery, baby, this is just lamaze
The ice cream and pickles, the tickle and a massage
The King Arthur/author, "Rhythm of the Night/Knight," El Debarge
The camouflage water in the distance
Logging a camel to get there with the quickness
Mean and vicious
Grinch who stole Christmas and hid it in the garage
There was a collage, a barrage that brought all things 
That seemed keen to help this thing start
Jump, jump, my battery charge
I'm bout my green like string beans and beings from mars
Its a mean thing to be seen with ours
Got that FNF homie I'm a young little thriller
I will resurrect homie come back for my killer
In some disheveled apparel with that same leaking barrel
It's on

[Chorus]</pre>
